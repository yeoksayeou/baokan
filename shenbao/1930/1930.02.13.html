<h3>海軍會議中之潛艇問題（默）</h3>
<p>英美對日巡艦比率六成與七成之爭。世界。視爲關乎海會。成敗與和。平前途最要。之問題者。今尙盤馬彎弓未發。而先。於潛艇問題露其競爭之端。英美方面。對潛艇力主全廢。日本方面。則極力反對全廢。吾人觀昨日大會時兩方公表之演說。英麥。克唐。納與美。史汀生。皆以潛艇在海濱防務上。不關重要。大抵多用以取攻勢。及襲。擊無警備之商船。爲一極不人道之物。前此使西半球捲入歷史上最烈之歐戰旋。渦者。潛艇。實爲厲階。日本海相。則以爲潛。艇實爲近海防禦之要圖。有多數海岸線。之國。必不可少。若言人道則飛機飛艇。爲害更甚兩方。面之言實針。鋒相對。英美欲。以潛艇限制日本攻勢之海軍力。日本則欲藉潛艇以維持攻勢之海軍力。以對付。英美。非然者日本以海岸線論。僅長五千五百七十哩。不及英美遠甚。何反反對英。美之提案也。</p>
<p>夫此潛艇問題。尙非倫敦會議中之主要。問題英美雖主張全廢。然亦已聲明至不。能全廢時。可加以限制。以減輕潛艇之毒禍。日本雖反對全廢。然爲公論所迫。亦不。能。不稍遷就。以贊同限制之。議故此問題。不旋踵即就調停途徑。遽以限制辦法結。束也。惟英美。日對於軍縮意見上之。不相容。已於此問題露其端倪。至將來入於繼。起討論之最主。要一幕。相爭至若何程。度能否不擴大其裂痕。則殊非吾人所能懸。斷。今日美電謂報館記者訪發明家愛迪生氏。詢以倫敦會議之結果。愛氏謂曾議。雖可成功。然觀今日科學發明。尙未達足以擔保消滅戰爭之時。則其對於和平前。途。亦尙未敢抱樂觀也。</p>

<h3>倫敦會議限制潛艇用途</h3>
<p>各國意見一致</p>
<p>法日代表藉口國防反對全廢意國主張與主力艦同受限制法全權對英提出海軍總噸數日本謀貫澈巡艦七成率要求十一日大會、各國關於潛水艦之議論、英美主張全廢、意大利主張附以條件廢止、日法對此三國議論、則大唱反對、惟關於全廢不可能時、應嚴格制限其使用一點、各國意見、可謂完全一致、（電通社）</p>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電　今日海會開全部大會討論潛艇問題時、法海軍部長萊巨謂潛艇與非潛艇同爲一種軍艦、豈因潛艇擾亂非潛艇之習慣與相沿辦法、而遂必欲去之乎、法政府以爲潛艇對於商船之無限制的戰爭、應爲法所不容、但潛艇應與非潛艇有同様搜檢捕拘商船之權、法國深信法水兵之紀律、準備以條約自繩、法國不能承認廢除潛艇、但準備贊成規定潛艇用途之國際協定、故渠動議指定一委員會、編製一種協定、禁止潛艇對於商船有除嚴密遵守水面軍艦所適用現有及將來規則外之舉動云、上述法代表之動議、及美代表所發範圍更大之提議、由英總代表之建議、提交海會之第一委員會審查、全體大會公開兩小時後、休會、美國提議將使第一委員會研究三個問題、而報告之、㈠潛艇之廢除、㈡戰時潛艇用途之規定、使之遵守規定水面軍艦用途之規則、㈢潛艇各個噸量之規定、當會議時、意外交大臣格蘭第問是否不能覓一解决方法、一面廢除潛艇、一面廢除主力艦、以達到切實之軍縮、又謂潛艇乃軍備較少國用以抵制軍備較多國之利器、意國對於廢除潛艇問題、毫無成見、意國準備限制潛艇對於商船之用途、在原則上不反對潛艇之廢除、但須各海軍國皆同意耳云、英相麥唐納於閉會時、謂各代表在彼此意見相左時、仍極友好、此爲最可欣幸特色之一云、英海外自治藩屬代表在閉會前、正式接受英國關於潛艇之提議、會後英國某當道語人、謂海會現將照預定方針進行、今已經過互換意見之階級、而將考慮具體數目、各代表之情緒、較初開會時更覺融洽云、</p>
<p>電通社十一日倫敦電　本日之海軍全體會議、對潛水艇全廢問題、由英美代表先後發表意見後（見昨報）、坎拿大代表简單述贊成之旨、次由法國全權李谷登　、首先聲明法國反對潛水艦全廢、更述其論旨、略謂吾人對於使用潛水艦、締結國際協定、表示同意、故吾人爲準備此協定、使本會議草就關於此問題之草案起見、宜任命委員起草、禁止現在及將來潛水艦對商船行動之法案、使所有海軍國簽字、此吾人所提出之决議案也、吾人前謂潛水艦與他種艦、爲同一之物、且爲專爲防禦的武器者、亦即在此、法國所以痛感潛水艦之必要者、因法本國與其殖民地之地形、均須此種武器爲防禦之用故也云云、次由印度及愛爾蘭代表述贊成英美全廢論之意見、次由意全權述條件附廢止論、次由日本財部全權以日語演說、（詞見後）次由紐絲綸及南斐代表贊成全廢、最後由史汀生提出别項之决議案、議長乃一併與法國提出之决議案、詢諸議塲、乃附托第一委員會於午後一時散會、</p>
<p>電通社十一日倫敦電　日本全權財部海相、於本日之總會席上、正式發表日本反對潛水艦全廢之意見、其演說要旨如下、廢止潛水艦以减少由戰爭所釀成之慘禍、此種人道的動機、日本應表滿幅之贊意、惟潛水艦視其用途如何、有須加以考慮者、潛水艦之固有用途、在於防禦近海、蓋潛水艦對於有多數海岸綫之國、爲必要不可缺者、以此等國對於島嶼水路、須有充分之防禦也、若僅就人道的動機言之、則較潛水艦以上應廢止者、爲數不少、即舉一例言之、如飛行機飛行船是、蓋航空機一面雖對於和平的交通、有所貢獻、若爲戰爭武器、其威力之大、遠非潛水艦所能比擬、且航空機不僅在海上逞其暴力、即在陸上亦然、日本對於不使世界大戰之恐怖經騐、再行發生、以嚴格規定其用途之提案、大表贊成、又日本旣署名批准關於潛水艦之華府條約、即在此次會議、亦甚望參加各國於最近之將來、逹到可以實施之圓滿協定、惟對於以使用合法的、同時爲防禦的武器爲非之約束、當表明絕對反對之意、對於此種提案、不得不唱滿幅的異議云、</p>
<p>路透社十一日倫敦電　美總代表史汀生今晚發表一文、言海會事、謂今日之全體大會、已有實在而非試騐之决議、與會五國皆依允限制潛艇對於商船之用途、使與水面軍艦受同様規則、即此一事、已使美代表團倫敦之行爲不虚矣、今日之辯論、如趨向潛艇將來廢除之一步驟、尤可使人欣悅者、限制潛艇用途之動議、發自法國代表團云、</p>

<h3>航業近訊</h3>
<p>長江貨多船少　上海去冬積存之長江貨、未及運去者甚夥、現因江水漸漲、已在趕裝中、惟日來華輪僅有四船可開、各客貨之不及裝載者、多爲外輪攬去、招商局已先將海輪遇順號調行長江、勉强維持商運昨日三北公司、又將平安公司之新寳華輪租下、以月租四千元之代價、暫訂租期二個半月、亦派行滬漢、供客需求、惟船身較小、祇可載六百噸、而慰情則略勝於無</p>

<p>爭裝湖絲　今次風潮、即起自爭運湖絲、按中國每年運美之湖絲、查上年共運去五十五萬七千包以水脚而論照原定之價格計之、共須八百八十餘萬元華幣、自金漲事起、華絲去美之額、因辦日絲之美商改購華絲、故本年之出口絲額、當較去年爲多、自經日商减跌水脚之後以全年運美之絲額計之、水脚上須减少七百萬元之收人、在此狂跌運費時、各公司爭運甚烈祥泰洋行之戈爾特輪、今次赴美係全船承載湖絲出口、昔時中美輪、以絲之水脚爲最優、今已一變而爲最劣之運率矣</p>
<p>討讑减價　上海行駛紐約一路之商輪、自上年改行快船以來、對運輸上與太平洋輪競爭頗烈而湖絲裝載亦甚多、每百磅减收五元五角美金、查加入此路競爭者、有挪美合辦之巴勃惠廉姆遜公司、丹　克爾文生公司英國太子·銀行·砲臺·美國史丹德·大洋·等各輪公司現在各該公司、對於紐約運絲價减跌至四元一百磅一事尙在討論之中但勢須實現、另議改善裝運辦法、惟尙未公布</p>
<p>補救搗亂　自日商兩次跌價事起、各外輪公司、即認爲苟如此常行、則中美間輪業、將發生極大之危險、但據一般觀察　日人旣施行搗亂而且有後援可恃、或將更跌去若干、亦在意　聞太平洋内各輪公司、公認此次日商之亂减水脚、爲營業競爭、殊不合商業規例、有失商戰正執、各公司曾討論多次、擬由在公會之各航商、勸導未入會之日商川崎三井等、亦加入太平洋水脚公會、以杜其再有搗亂之舉、但日人别有主意、恐非勸導所能收效也、</p>

<h3>臨時法院昨訊女子串殺庶母案</h3>
<p>法庭中旁聽人滿</p>
<p>小刀係張文卿物</p>
<p>後門上之血手印</p>
<p>法官着捕房調查</p>
<p>昨日下午二時半鐘、臨時法院第一法庭、由羅人驥推事偕觀審之美領孟哈脫氏升座、審理女子張文卿因爭奪遺產、串同陳恒才·姚永貴·高金堂·等、將其庶母殺死一案、此案開審時、雙方家屬戚友及法院中職員到庭旁聽者甚衆、法庭中大有人滿之勢、茲將此案經過及開審情形、詳誌於後、</p>
<p>本案之經過　有湖州人張福生者、前清時曾任直隸縣令、薄有積蓄、解職後、舉家來滬、寄寓新閘卡德路七百六十二號門牌、張有一妻一妾、妻蘇氏、育兩女、長文卿、現年廿四歲、猶未字人、而次女則已出嫁、妾亦蘇氏、年三十四歲、生二子、長十三歲、名金寳、字文金、次子年十一歲、名錢寳、字文錢、妻妾同居一處、嗣福生病故、妻妾間頃起爭奪遺產之事、因福生生前有現欵數千兩、存於滬上四明興業銀行、其存摺則落於妾手、不肯交出、嗣妻之長女文卿、即向銀行掛失、妾遂以刑事控其大婦於臨時法院、雖經傳訊、卒因雙方和解、將案撤銷、後大婦亦以民事控妾、結果以和解時、張蘇氏忽遭殺害、當經該管戈登路捕房華探目郎錦·包探于長源·拘獲案犯張文卿·陳恒才·二名、供出兇手姚永貴·高金堂·匿迹鎭江、該探等又往鎭江將姚·高·兩人拘獲、提回捕房、解送臨時法院一度鞠訊各情、已誌本報、</p>
<p>須問大姑娘　昨日續訊、屍屬方面延王咸穀等兩律師、而被告女子張文卿、亦延王黼裳·蔣保釐·蔣保亷·等三律師到庭代辯　首由捕房律師汝葆彝起而陳述案情畢、即據證人蔡厚安供、在新閘路紅十字會爲藥劑師、上月二十五號下午六時、傷者張蘇氏由張文卿及隣居婦人雇車送來、據文卿稱在家被盜戳傷　嗣見傷者頭部與手部均受刀傷、由我與顧世良帮同將創口包紮、我向傷者詰問原由、據稱此事大姑娘（即文卿）知悉、并見文卿解開傷者衣服、取去紙張、越一刻鐘、捕房中西探到來、向傷者詰問、我祇聞傷者云、此事問大姑娘便知、又據顧世良供稱、在紅十字會爲護士、我祇聞張文卿向傷者詢問兇手臨行時、曾云非但將汝（即傷者）戳死　尙須將爾兩子及我殺死、有此語乎、傷者不語、後捕房包探到來向傷者詢問被戳原因、有無姦情、而傷者均答須問大姑娘、</p>
<p>騙至客堂中　又據包探于長源投稱、是晚七時、與西探長麥克歪倫同往紅十字會、訊問傷者、據稱陳恒才與大小姐文卿相識、當時有恒才之姨哥永貴、帶同一不相識之人到來、將其騙至客堂中、該不相識者即突出剌刀、將其刺傷、</p>
<p>長次子供詞　又據死者之長子張金寳供、十三歲、我呼文卿爲大姊姊、我母被害時、我適出門外游玩、至六時、與胞弟回家、從後門入内、而由姚永貴開門後、姚即偕一不相識者逃去、我行至後天井、見大姊姊從樓上奔下、並見我母倒於地、母見我弟兄至、即呼我名數聲、并叫我至母舅處去、至該不相識者即屬第四被告高金堂、又據次子張錢寳供述一過、　　持刀戳死去　詰之被告姚永貴供、鎭江人、滬住康腦脫路七五一號、開設老虎灶、陳恒才與我親戚、張家並不常往、是日恒才到來喚我至卡德路打架、我遂與高金堂同往至張宅後門首、時門已大開、遂入内、其時樓下并無他人、我與死者談話、未幾高即持刀、將死者猛戳、其時大小　在樓上、陳恒才在廚房内、翌日我即回籍、羅推事向姚詰問囗、據陳恒才供詞内、謂當時汝將死者之手拖住、高乃力刺之、然乎、姚答否、</p>
<p>在門外等候　高金堂供、鎭江人、在康腦脫路老虎灶爲夥、與姚永貴相距不遠與陳恒才爲同鄕、是日恒才·永貴·到來邀我游玩、行經張宅門口、彼兩人入内、我在門外等候、移時彼兩人復出令我速走餘事不知、</p>
<p>不交還存摺　張文卿供廿四歲、父張福生死已多年、母蘇氏、去年因患病由庶母將存摺等取去、後母病愈、而庶母不肯將存摺交還、我乃向銀行掛失、計四明銀行五千餘兩、興業银行二千餘兩、庶母乃以刑事控我母親、後將案和解、</p>
<p>妝奩費已交　我母亦以民事控訴、着令歸還管理權、及追還存摺、嗣雙方訂立條件、將案撤回、其條件係提出銀一千五百兩、作爲我出閣之妝奩、并提一千兩爲母親零用、但我之費用、雖已提出交我、而母親之零用、仍未提出、仍由庶母管理、</p>
<p>借錢開書作　嗣後我與庶母之感情、回復如初、毫無意見、故我實無欲謀死庶母之意、去年十一月底、陳恒才欲向庶母借銀一千五百兩、開設書作、由我　言、庶母不可借給、遂拒絕之、恒才乃懐恨於心、欲以手槍對庶母、</p>
<p>庶母欲捲逃　但於去年十月間、由庶母家之侄女王大寳至我處、對我云、庶母之弟蘇祥年、因涉訟事件、欲將我害死、又於十一月間、聞恒才言、庶母欲席捲所有、另行居住、</p>
<p>小刀係我物　我在樓上、聞樓下姚永貴與庶母談話、未幾我聞警下樓、見、永貴等已不知去向、庶母倒臥於地、受有刀傷、我遂與隣居婦人將其車送紅十字會醫治、至當時行兇之小刀、雖係我物、惟置在妝檯抽　内、被恒才竊去、</p>
<p>張文卿起意　質之陳恒才供稱、殺死蘇氏之事、係張文卿起意、事前商量有兩個月、因爲涉訟之事、囑我帮他、並謂彼能出錢、着我叫人、將蘇氏弄死、彼且允給四百元、先付五十元、至是日下午四時三刻、在附近弄内交給高金堂洋二十元、其時我與永貴同在、兇刀即於此時由文卿交與高金堂、彼等三人、乃同入張家、我未同往各等語、</p>
<p>調查血手印　末由羅推事傳尸弟蘇耀亭訊問一過、并由兩造律師起而向以上各人駁詰之下、時已薄暮、羅推事以據蘇耀亭訴狀内、謂張宅門上尙有血手印等情、遂諭本案改期、并着捕房調查該門上有無手印、補傳人證續訊、諭畢退庭、各被告仍分别還押、</p>

<h3>蘭因殉葬一船孃</h3>
<p>— 頴川馥潤</p>
<p>浙中山水甲天下。靈秀所鍾。都產佳麗。船孃柳箇紅。小家碧玉也。其先爲桐江望族。簪纓家聲。及女父嗜賭若命。盧雉朝夕。而家傾焉。無以爲生。乃趣女北下富春。以艇載客。藉謀斗升之給。　　女容華絕代。媚麗佚羣。而剪剪雙瞳。每撩人情緒於一轉間。急色者爭趨之。會有虎林丁生。一温文美少年也。上年春。銜民廳命。來富佐治村政。因事不鄕。詣渡頭覓舟。得女。驚爲天仙化人。授與神魂。爲之船頭拜倒。試與語。則言辭風釆。好語如珠。曼妙流利。欵作黃鶯兒出谷啼也。兩者傾心互印。恨相見也晚。從茲晨花春早。夜月秋遲。嘗共一葉扁舟。盪漾乎富春江上。洩洩融融。應妒煞閑眠沙裏兩鴛鴦也。</p>
<p>歷春而夏而秋而冬。生患貧血之症。纒綿數月。有女爲勞。何如天不佑人。沉疴莫挽。於一夕之姜風苦雨時。生辭世死。女即夜亦飲刃其側。作蘭因之殉。傷哉。丁之友人擬爲合葬東山之陽。已向雙方家屬接洽一是。結束此一段佳話也。</p>
<h3>記廣州之中山園</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>客自廣州來者。侈談廣州事。廣州爲我國南部最稱繁盛之都會。近年以來。更力求市政之刷新。馬路修廣。街市清潔。允爲東南之冠。廣州市有中山公園。佔地數畝。佈置甚美。花木亭池。應有盡有。爲市民游樂之勝地。市政府力事講求。藉公衆娱息塲所。以事宣傳。園内各亭。均裝有傳聲之筒。用無綫電廣播一至下午。游人雜集。但聞各喇叭管所放來各種報告。商塲市情。以及名人演辭。名家歌唱。聲聲入耳。空谷傳來。至爲清晰。且遇西樂間作。外人之游斯園者。每借綠林片地。</p>
<h3>文虎徵射</h3>
<p>— 吳蓮洲</p>

<h3>美人酒令</h3>
<p>— 澹宕生</p>
<p>李氏綠雲山館。背山面溪。修竹環之。同人集消寒會於其中。恒以雅歌侑酒。至第六集。議略變前例。林君鶴　曰。我想得一法。可名之曰美人酒令。用紙卷。卷書在字。都屬人體。如美人心。美人目。美人口之類。盡美人身上悉書之。當可得數十卷。行邻之法。拈得一卷。展視何字。即以此字引成語一句誦之。而以當令之次坐一人爲令官。句中有此字。即從己數起。數至第幾字。即第幾人飲。此直截了當。無需令官者也。所以需令官者。所引成語。或但切字意。不見字面。則令官爲之判斷。何人當飲。判斷須有理由。如當飲者不服判斷。而申說之理較暢。令官不能屈。則令官自飲。林君再舉便以語同坐曰。譬如拈得一卷爲美人目。誦曰。美目盼兮。則第二人飲。第二人即令官。亦不當辭。或誦欲窮千里目。則第五人飲。此句不切美人。亦可通融。如大衆以爲當從嚴格。則凡所引之句。當令者須陪飲一杯。又或誦曰。怎當他臨去秋波那一轉。此但切字意。不見字面者。令官可判斷之曰。秋波字在六七。排下坐第六第七者飲。又坐中有張性者。亦當飲。以此一轉秋波。爲的是張君瑞也。惟秋波尙是著眼字。若遇渾寫大意之句。則令官頗見心思也。於是衆皆稱善。即裁紙作卷。取筆書之。搜索美人身體之字。乃至腸胃肺肝。不可窺見之處。亦書入卷。有甚褻者。亦弗遺焉。其破三字爲四字。則如指甲汗毛等等。無微不至矣。書畢。得四十二卷。令旣行。艶思綺語。玉屑清言。歡笑紛紜。觥籌交錯。可謂盡讌飲之樂。茲以較有風趣之令官判斷。錄之如下。楊君蔚如拈得美人淚。因誦曰。滴向秋階發海棠。令官李海籌曰。蔚如與我幼年同學。知其小字秋棠。當飲兩杯。蔚如曰。我意以海字射君。乃反自罰。海籌曰。我可一杯。君自當倍之。張君仲華拈得美人臂。誦曰。枕上誰消玉一彎。余爲令官。曰王君卓如飲。問何故。曰。君發起消寒社。玉質森寒。君爲消寒社主。同人自當讓君消受此艶福耳。李君海籌拈得美人手。誦曰。爲郎熨貼指尖寒。令官曰。再請卓如飲。問何由。曰。此又是消寒社主獨自消受之艶福也。且此句爲王次回詩。君姓王。又有關係。以君酒量欠洪。否則當敬雙杯矣。余拈得美人私。搜索枯腸。殊難即得。先是。汪君雲笙已拈得此。誦夜半無人私語時句。雖明嵌私字。究未精切。令官謂除第五人當飲外。判以左坐並肩一人飲。云曾觀演長生殿</p>

<h3>荀慧生劇談</h3>
<p>— 蔚</p>
<p>舍予前作慧生演十三妹劇談。是日開演。上座甚盛。觀其全劇塲子。緊密貫串。演來殊多精采。而上下場身段姿勢。無不於嫵媚中含有俠氣。唱有數段快板及原板。抑揚間亦覺清穩柔和。紅柳村悅來店能仁寺前曾演過。此次删去其宂場。而保留警筆處。如悦來店回店一節。今已删去。蓋驢夫過場。本無若何意味也。念白字字清楚。拯救張安二人。復撮成好事。傳神處可以壓倒同儕矣。守靈更易素衣。而眉宇間仍露急欲報仇意。迨遇張金鳳挑以婚姻時。乃知有同圓好夢之機。被張所窘。表情極佳妙。末塲擒賊。雖一小波。亦全劇結束也。此戲故事見諸說部、配以芙蓉草張金鳳。春彥仲仁氏父子。	銖　悉稱。富祿僧妻。舉動發言。令人認俊。曹毛包鄧九公。亦十分賣力也。</p>
<p>杜十娘怒沉百寳箱一劇。在前幾成爲南方旦角無人不演之戲。平伶中尙未見有扮演者。慧生與編劇名手陳墨香先生修改該本。增入唱工詞句。曲雅可取。唱腔亦自與他人不同。蘇三亞仙。　演旣獲衆譽。十娘必能同工也。</p>
<p>人但知慧生花旦最所擅長。而不知其能演悲苦哀情之戲。在平編有呂后妬斬戚姫之魚藻宮。及陸放翁休姿之釵頭鳳兩劇。每一出演。座客未有不因情感衝而落淚者。劇本完善。有益世人之作也。</p>
<h3>談徐碧雲</h3>
<p>— 豪</p>
<p>大凡成一名角。必有其所以成名之基本優點。予素不喜觀劇。而獨喜話匣。休沐之暇。偶以此爲消遣。覺以青衣之唱片最爲受聽。以其靜細婉曼也。而徐碧雲之寳蓮燈御碑亭玉堂春諸劇。尤爲清脆流利。於以知其成名之匪可倖致也。碧雲爲斌慶社傑出人材。數來海上。譽與四金剛埒。日作偶往聆其劇。覺其嗓音已爐火純表。而神情道白。尤逼似梅蘭芳。知其親炙者深矣。他日繼畹華而起。其斯人歟。碧雲傑作玉堂春已屢售滿座。尙有　珠夢綠珠别姬諸劇。將以次起演。當另有一番盛况也。</p>
<p>七夕密誓。唐明皇常在貴妃左面也。余思之略久。乃曰。得諭語一句。衆問何。余曰。女器也。或曰。此亦解鈴格乎。曰然。汝字古書多作女字也。或欵凡器官均可謂之器。恐難切定私字。余微笑。令官王君曰。也字說文作女陰。此句可云極切。因指郁君曰。君當飲。下文問何器也。曰瑚璉也。君大名有一瑚字。固當飲矣。記隨園詩話有消寒須用美人兵句。如斯酒令。亦可云消寒佳話矣。</p>
<h3>小瓶花齋宴集記</h3>
<p>— 燕下鄕客</p>
<p>人日乍晴。春寒料峭。小瓶花齋主人。設饌招宴。座中皆清流勝侶。弢迹海濱。各以著述書畫自給。不使人間造孼錢者。酒半。主人出所藏名畫。屏幅手卷扇册。古今凡數下事。一一縱觀。湯君東父。鬻畫未久。余固未之識也。是日見其所作四尺條幅一。便面二。覺其意竟高遠。筆致深秀。頗能參合石田墨井廉州諸家。詢之主人。乃知湯君爲湯貞愍雨生將軍嫡裔。宜乎其家學淵源。逈非凡近。足與近日顧吳諸公相匹也。聞湯君性謙而介。旣不徇俗。亦不立異。丹青之外。雅嗜杯杓。余亦稱酒徒。畫雖略知門徑。不敢涉筆。主人則愛畫而不肯自畫。收藏極富。鑒别尤精。今初見湯君之畫。爲主人所得。益歎其能有具眼。遂浮一大白。爲主人賀。並退而爲之記。分貽主人及湯君。與之訂交焉。（却酬）</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（四十）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>蒲台爾之死ＬamortdeＢourdelle</p>
<p>㈠噩耗</p>
<p>九月二十日。我們完結了兩個月的旅行。從瑞士回到巴黎。在這時我最着急的任務。就是送妻子進學校去讀書。虎兒是於九月二十八日跟隨着劉抗到　　楓丹白露Ｆontainebleau進中學去了。接着韻士也由程擷英女士的介紹。到巴黎附近五十里的白叢Ｂezon一個女學校裏去住讀。</p>
<p>在十月二日的下午。我與傳雷張弦二君送韻十到白叢去。我們坐着汽車。儘走儘走。走出巴黎城。走穿幾頂大橋。急流的賽納河和麥納河兩旁排立着槎枒的樹幹。澄澈的深秋的陽光在梢頭上汎濫着。當終結了長途的汽車。走近我們那目的地的Ｂeano時。很感到非常的舒適。</p>
<p>在電車路的盡頭。幽靜寂寥。全是鄕村風味的街道的一隅。是用木柵圍住的素樸的磚造樓房。大槪暴露在多年的風雨裏。已經成了古色古香的深灰色。兩扇大門都緊閉着。寂然不見人影。上面嵌一塊横額。用了金色刻着ＰensiounagＮotregＤame</p>
<p>不多久。我們便去按那門鈴。</p>
<p>門一開。是一個很大的花苑。多數櫟樹似的樹木。將細碎的影子。投射在綠茵上。我們對門房說明來意。引進右手的客廳裏。等了一會。校長出來了。穿着一身黑色的衣服。是一位好像已過六十歲的老人了。頒白的兩鬢。矮小的身材。顯着如老處女的柔和的相貎。</p>
<p>我們先將來意陳明。她就接着說。已經將房間預備好了。從前有一位鄭小姐和一位王夫人都在此多年的。這位就是MadameLiu嗎。年紀很青呀。她講了這些話。我便交了學費。就將韻士的行李搬入宿舍去了。宿舍在院子北邊。有十幾間素樸清潔的房間。分住着女生。靜寂地好像一所修道院。韻就佔據其中一間小屋。那時候韻士頗有些歡喜活潑的様子呵。時候薄暮了。我們便别了校長和韻士。離開這學校了。</p>

<p>之今日上海各新式華美住宅之種種改良及優點、本公司實與有提倡之功焉、</p>
<p>本公司之目標、在改善上海之居住　况、鼓勵租户使成自住房屋之業主、本公司曾以審愼之目光、明確之先見、選擇未經開發之地段、並取得當局者之合作、從事開闢道路、劃分地畝、而在其上建築式様不同之各種美麗住屋、一革往日粗笨磚屋之氣象、蓋凡中國營業公司所建之房屋、式様旣各不同、而室内最近代之裝修、居家之眷屬、見之尤稱羨不止也、其如衛生上之設備、如廚房浴室籌等四壁皆舖磁瓦大磁盆浴盆冷熱水管煤氣管電氣管抽水馬桶等等、無不應有盡有、精益求精焉、</p>
<p>約十五年以前、大環龍路、金神父路、辣斐德路、及法公園之間、有農田一大方、其價僅在每畝一千兩至一千五百兩之間、本公司有見於此、即自諸小業主手中、購得此地、計劃遂即開始、法界工部局深悉本公司之計劃、實於該租界大有裨益也、亦竭力相助、如煤氣自來水電氣等等公用、皆深得合作之効、尤以開廣道路、行人道上植樹等爲尤甚云、</p>
<p>本公司之計劃、成效甚著、惟本公司不以該地據爲私有藉以謀利、而以該地分作若干小方、取價每畝二千兩出售焉、</p>
<p>其中有數屋、係築成後以現金出售者、其不以現金而作爲抵押借欵或按月繳欵以代租金、皆無不可、且住户若對於此種房屋有不滿之處、本公司亦可墊資代建合意之新屋、此種售賣住屋之條件、旣可鼓勵貯蓄、同時强制節儉、實最有益之一種投資也、</p>
<p>在今日之上海、此地段即非最優之居住區、亦即最優居住區域之一、其中刻已無一空地、且所有房主、皆屬自住之業户、此地以現在之地價估之、每畝之値約在一萬五千兩之譜、而房屋則每所可售至四萬兩至六萬兩之譜、</p>
<p>凡依照本公司此種方法購置地產者、居處旣極舒適並皆貯蓄致富或出售而獲巨利云、</p>
<p>中華人士今日正需住宅之改良、惟在今日以前、中資階級之人、實無購買中式房屋之機會、故其所住之房屋、悉屬大地主之所購、而大地主亦惟利是視、憧數　多、收入愈大、築費愈輕、利亦愈厚、故住此等房屋者、幾不成其爲家室、僅可稱爲一　藉蔽風雨而已、而租費且極昂、普通一產、僅有總契據一、</p>
<p>中國營業公司深信中華人士、尤以婦女爲最、皆極思自有住宅、旣可獨占爲己有、並可任意加以增修改造或裝置、本公司有見、於此且欲作一試騐、以證明此理想、故復從事於建築中國式房屋一大段、每屋皆備各種近代裝置、其他則劃分爲若干方、每方有一單獨之契據、一俟該處房屋造成之後、即可出售、或以現金購置、或訂他種條件、皆無不可、</p>
<p>凡購置房產者、其計劃方策、與社會之需求相適應者、亦即於該社會之發達相助最深、故小業主百人其有利於社會實較一大業主爲大也、</p>
<p>本公司復有一種所謂地產押欵共利債券者、即小貯户得與大貯户同享優息、本公司收受十兩或十元以上之貯金、按照七厘付息、每半年照付一次、此種貯欵、由公司投資於最優等房產之抵押、並且分别專作此種債券保證之用、此外、本公司復以全公司之資產爲之担保、本公司對於此事、另立專部管理、此種債券以利息百分之二十五作爲債券之紅利、故持有此種債券者、年息總在八厘或八厘以上、此前此四年之情形也、</p>
<p>夫最可靠最後成效之營業、莫各地產信託公司、其於地產方面所立財政上之地位、猶之商業中之銀行也、凡百社會無諭大小、其中以地產爲營業之公司、皆視其人民之多寡及地產投資之多少爲歸依焉、</p>
<p>夫上海之地產投資、不知若干萬萬、然上海之人民、尙無一公衆承認之塲所、可以用可靠之担保品（地產道契）押借現金地產出售得成迅速之交易、新購主可因而取得關於各種需要考慮之資科、售主隨時可知其地產之現行價値及四週地產價値之比較、得經濟之扶助、使建築得以良改良、抵押貯欵等項皆能迅速設法廢除各種大地產公司對於担保保險等需求之遲延、</p>
<p>中國營業公司近擬將其尙未發行之股券一百五十萬兩、悉數發行、使股本增至二百萬兩之數、於是即從事組織一大規模之地產於託公司、夫本公司創設以來、已歷二十餘載、其管理人員及營業方針、自始至今、未一更動、故凡與本公司有交易者、無論中外人士莫不表示滿意、而本公司對於上海一隅之地產事業、亦能悉心研究使事業與日俱進、前後抵押欵項之由本公司經手者、不下四千五百萬兩本利、皆已悉數付清、即其明證也、中國營業公司之位置、在上海商業之中心、亦即上海地產事業之集點也、其中職員中外計共九十餘人、所經理之房屋、凡五千餘所、華人地產之託、其經營者有八百人之多、本公司生產力之偉大、識見之宏遠、管理之得法、於其所宣佈之營業狀况中可見其一般矣、</p>

<p>National Telegrams</p>
<h3>Continued Decline in Silver Prices Urgently Requires Remedial Measures</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Proposes Banning the Import of Foreign Silver Coins</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi stated that the import of silver coins has been enormous in recent years. Last winter, the Annam government adopted the gold exchange standard and began selling off all its silver reserves. A significant amount was sold in Shanghai, leading to a continued decline in silver prices. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, another 5 million yuan of Annam silver coins were imported. The recent rise in gold prices is partly due to this fact. If measures are not taken to prohibit such imports, foreign currencies will continue to flood in, and silver prices will inevitably continue to fall, significantly impacting domestic finance. Therefore, a proposal is submitted to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Ministry of Finance instruct customs offices to prohibit the import of all foreign silver coins, unless specifically authorized by the Ministry of Finance. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should telegraph the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, proposing an international exchange conference to discuss the issue with the British and French governments, and requesting them to inform the Indian and Annam governments to suspend the export of existing silver coins for a certain period to remedy the situation. Separate letters and telegrams have been sent to Chiang and Tan, as follows: (1) The letter to Tan reads: "According to reports, recently a large amount of Vietnamese silver coins has been imported, totaling 5 million yuan, which was handed over to Shanghai to purchase gold coins. It is a common practice in various countries to prohibit the import of foreign silver coins, which can be implemented by the Ministry of Finance through an order. The International Exchange Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva on the 27th of this month to discuss the issue of declining silver prices and take appropriate measures, which is of great importance to our country. It is advisable for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to propose that the British government temporarily suspend the sale of large amounts of silver reserves in India. This matter concerns international trade and affects the commerce of foreigners residing in China, especially British merchants, who are sure to sympathize with this proposal. Due to my illness, I am unable to attend, but the decline in silver prices is of great importance to the future of the country. In addition to submitting the proposal for your deliberation, I am writing this special letter to explain the matter." (2) The telegram to Chiang reads: "Recently, the high price of gold and the low price of silver have caused panic in the social economy. Previously, I was ordered to formulate concrete plans to remedy the situation. Unfortunately, I fell ill at sea and am deeply concerned. I am eager to investigate the truth and take remedial measures. However, yesterday the price of gold soared again, reaching a high of 501 taels. According to reliable reports, foreign banks imported a large amount of foreign silver coins, melted them into raw silver, and purchased gold coins for speculative profits, which exacerbated this phenomenon. (The French Bank of Indochina imported 3 million yuan of Vietnamese silver coins yesterday.) If measures are not taken to prohibit this, I fear that our country's finances will be in chaos, and commerce will be severely affected. As an emergency measure, I propose that the Ministry of Finance instruct the Director-General of Customs to prohibit the import of foreign silver coins to provide relief. (All countries prohibit the import of large amounts of foreign currency.) Furthermore, since India gradually implemented the gold standard, it has been selling off large amounts of silver coins since last year, which has led to a decline in silver prices and affected the world. It is said that the League of Nations is planning to convene a conference to study relief measures. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should instruct the representative to the League of Nations to propose to the League General Assembly that the British government instruct the Indian government that all existing silver coins in India must not be exported for two years, and that they can only be sold again when the price of gold returns to its former level of two shillings and six pence. In this way, the world's finances will be consolidated, and both Chinese and foreign trade will benefit." (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Submarine Issue at the Naval Conference (Silent)</h3>
<p>The dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States over the ratio of 60% and 70% of cruisers compared to Japan is viewed by the world as the most critical issue concerning the success or failure of the naval conference and the future of peace. Although the issue is still under discussion, the competition has already surfaced on the submarine issue. The United Kingdom and the United States advocate for the complete abolition of submarines, while Japan strongly opposes it. Observing the speeches made by both sides at yesterday's conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald and American Secretary of State Stimson both stated that submarines are not essential for coastal defense and are mainly used for offensive purposes and to attack unguarded merchant ships, making them extremely inhumane. Submarines were the main culprit that dragged the Western Hemisphere into the most intense European war in history. The Japanese Minister of the Navy argued that submarines are essential for coastal defense and indispensable for countries with long coastlines. Regarding inhumane weapons, airplanes and airships are even more harmful. The statements of both sides are sharply opposed. The United Kingdom and the United States want to limit Japan's offensive naval power by restricting submarines, while Japan wants to maintain its offensive naval power through submarines to counter the United Kingdom and the United States. Otherwise, Japan's coastline is only 5,570 miles long, far less than that of the United Kingdom and the United States, so why does it oppose the proposals of the United Kingdom and the United States?</p>
<p>The submarine issue is not the main issue in the London conference. Although the United Kingdom and the United States advocate for complete abolition, they have stated that if complete abolition is not possible, they can be limited to reduce the harm of submarines. Although Japan opposes complete abolition, it is forced by public opinion to make some concessions and agree to the limitations. Therefore, this issue will soon be resolved through mediation with a limited solution. However, the incompatibility of opinions on arms reduction between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan has already surfaced on this issue. As the discussion moves on to the most important part, it is difficult to predict how intense the conflict will be and whether the rift will widen. Today, an American telegram reported that newspaper reporters visited inventor Thomas Edison to inquire about the outcome of the London conference. Edison said that although the conference may be successful, current scientific inventions have not yet reached a point where they can guarantee the elimination of war, so he is not optimistic about the future of peace.</p>
<p>In yesterday's commentary, the character "heng" in the phrase "uneven progress of production and trade in various countries" was mistakenly written as "ji." This correction is attached.</p>

<h3>London Conference Restricts Submarine Use</h3>
<p>Unified Opinions Among Countries</p>
<p>French and Japanese Representatives Oppose Total Abolition Citing National Defense / Italian Proposal to be Restricted the Same as Battleships / French Plenipotentiary Presents Total Naval Tonnage Demands to England / Japan Seeks to Implement 70% Ratio of Cruisers / At the general meeting on the 11th, regarding the discussion of submarines by various countries, England and the United States advocated total abolition, and Italy advocated conditional abolition. Japan and France strongly opposed the arguments of these three countries. However, regarding the point that when total abolition is impossible, their use should be strictly restricted, the opinions of various countries can be said to be completely consistent. (Denttsu News Agency)</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - At today's plenary session of the Naval Conference discussing the submarine issue, French Naval Minister Leygues stated that submarines and non-submarines are both warships. Should submarines be abolished simply because they disrupt the customs and established methods of non-submarines? The French government believes that the unrestricted warfare of submarines against merchant ships is unacceptable to France. However, submarines should have the same rights as non-submarines to search, inspect, and detain merchant ships. France firmly believes in the discipline of French sailors and is prepared to restrain itself by treaty. France cannot agree to abolish submarines, but is prepared to support international agreements stipulating the use of submarines. Therefore, he moved to appoint a committee to draft an agreement prohibiting submarines from engaging in actions against merchant ships other than strictly observing the existing and future rules applicable to surface warships. The aforementioned motion of the French representative and the broader proposal of the US representative were submitted to the First Committee of the Naval Conference for review at the suggestion of the British chief delegate. The plenary session adjourned after two hours. The United States proposed that the First Committee study three issues and report them: 1. The abolition of submarines. 2. Stipulations on the use of submarines in wartime, making them abide by the rules governing the use of surface warships. 3. Stipulations on the individual tonnage of submarines. During the meeting, Foreign Minister Grandi asked whether it was not possible to find a solution that would simultaneously abolish submarines and battleships in order to achieve genuine disarmament. He also stated that submarines are weapons used by countries with fewer armaments to resist countries with more armaments. Italy has no preconceived notions about the abolition of submarines. Italy is prepared to limit the use of submarines against merchant ships and, in principle, does not oppose the abolition of submarines, but all naval powers must agree. At the close of the meeting, British Prime Minister MacDonald said that all delegates remained extremely friendly even when their opinions differed, which was one of the most gratifying features. Before the close of the meeting, representatives from British overseas autonomous territories formally accepted the British proposal regarding submarines. After the meeting, a British official told reporters that the Naval Conference would now proceed according to the pre-arranged plan, having already passed the stage of exchanging views and would now consider concrete figures. The mood of the delegates was more harmonious than at the beginning of the conference.</p>
<p>Denttsu News Agency, London, 11th - At today's plenary session of the Naval Conference, after the British and American representatives expressed their views on the issue of total submarine abolition (see yesterday's newspaper), the Canadian representative briefly stated his approval. Next, French Plenipotentiary Ligouden stated that France opposes the total abolition of submarines and further elaborated on his arguments, stating that we express our agreement to conclude an international agreement on the use of submarines. Therefore, in order to prepare for this agreement and to enable this conference to draft a draft on this issue, a committee should be appointed to draft a bill prohibiting submarines from acting against merchant ships now and in the future, so that all naval powers can sign it. This is the resolution we are proposing. We said earlier that submarines are the same as other ships and are weapons specifically for defense, which is also the reason why France strongly feels the need for submarines, because the terrain of France and its colonies requires this type of weapon for defense. Next, representatives from India and Ireland expressed their support for the British and American arguments for total abolition, followed by the Italian plenipotentiary who stated his conditional abolition theory. Next, Japanese Plenipotentiary Treasurer spoke in Japanese (the words are shown later). Next, representatives from New Zealand and South Africa supported total abolition. Finally, Stimson put forward another resolution. The chairman then combined the resolution put forward by France and asked the participants, and then entrusted it to the First Committee to adjourn at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Denttsu News Agency, London, 11th - Japanese Navy Minister and Plenipotentiary Zaibu officially expressed Japan's opposition to the total abolition of submarines at today's general meeting. The main points of his speech are as follows: Abolishing submarines to reduce the tragedy caused by war is a humanitarian motive, and Japan should express its full approval. However, the inherent use of submarines lies in defending coastal waters, because submarines are necessary and indispensable for countries with many coastlines, because these countries must have sufficient defense for islands and waterways. If we only talk about humanitarian motives, there are many things that should be abolished more than submarines, for example, airplanes and airships. Although airplanes contribute to peaceful transportation, if they are weapons of war, their power is far greater than that of submarines. Moreover, aircraft not only use their violence at sea, but also on land. Japan is strongly in favor of proposals to strictly regulate the use of weapons in order to prevent the horrors of the World War from happening again. Moreover, Japan has signed and ratified the Washington Treaty regarding submarines, and at this conference, it also hopes that the participating countries will reach a satisfactory agreement that can be implemented in the near future. However, it must express its absolute opposition to the restraint of using legal and defensive weapons. I must express my full disagreement with this kind of proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - US Chief Delegate Stimson issued an article tonight on the Naval Conference, saying that today's plenary session has made a real rather than an experimental resolution. The five participating countries all agreed to restrict the use of submarines against merchant ships, making them subject to the same rules as surface warships. This alone has made the US delegation's trip to London worthwhile. Today's debate, as a step towards the future abolition of submarines, is even more gratifying. The motion to restrict the use of submarines originated from the French delegation.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 12th - A telegram from London on the 11th stated that the British and French plenipotentiaries met in the British House of Commons tonight. French Plenipotentiary Thédiéux presented the total tonnage required by the French Navy as follows: a total of 799,000 tons, battleships 170 (thousand tons as a unit), aircraft carriers 60, cruisers 120, light cruisers 270, submarines 124, special vessels 55.</p>
<p>Denttsu News Agency, London, 11th - Regarding the new US disarmament plan to suppress Japan's 70% demand, the Japanese side remains silent and has not expressed any public opinion. However, Plenipotentiary Zaibu said to reporters regarding this matter, it is a fact that there will be contact between Japan and the United States soon. After the proposal, there is no expression of what kind of meaning the future holds, so it is best to discuss these matters fully and then seek a solution. It is hoped that they can exchange opinions frankly with Britain and the United States in order to implement their主張. They have replied with pleasure to 理德 Plenipotentiary's request for a meeting, and they should be able to meet in two or three days.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Fort Myers, 11th - Today is the 83rd birthday of the great American inventor Thomas Edison. Reporters from various newspapers rushed to celebrate. Someone asked him for his opinion on current affairs, and Edison said that in his opinion, the London Disarmament Conference will definitely be successful, but judging from the current progress of science, it is still not enough to guarantee that there will be no war in the future. Someone asked what the most important thing for the United States in 1930 was, and Edison said that Americans should pay attention to engineering and ask less about politics.</p>

<h3>External Report: Important Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today (the 12th) sent an official from its Intelligence Division to give a diplomatic report at the Central Broadcasting Station. The content was quite important and is recorded below: "Fellow comrades, today I represent the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to briefly report on the recent diplomatic situation. First, regarding the Sino-Russian issue, recently China, in order to respect the Kellogg-Briand Pact and its advocacy of peace, sent Cai Yunsheng as a peace representative to Boli (Khabarovsk) to hold preliminary consultations with the Soviet representative, specifically for the purpose of resolving the Sino-Eastern Railway dispute. However, after Cai Yunsheng arrived in Boli and discussed with the Soviet representative Simanovsky, the record established by the two on December 22nd of last year, in addition to stipulating methods for resolving the Sino-Eastern Railway dispute, also included several matters such as trade resumption and restoration of diplomatic relations, exceeding the scope of the central government's instructions. This time, the Director of the Sino-Eastern Railway, Mo Dehui, came to Beijing to report to the government the truth of all events, which was then understood. The government, after a lengthy study of this issue, decided that all diplomacy should be based on the standards of independence, freedom, and equality. Negotiations with Russia must both ensure the integrity of sovereignty to avoid affecting future revolutionary diplomacy, and also safeguard the safety of the lives and property of the people in the Northeast border region, so that they do not suffer various hardships due to the Russian issue. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a declaration regarding the Boli record, preparing to appoint representatives to go to Moscow to attend formal meetings, specifically to discuss the aftermath of the Sino-Eastern Railway issue. As for other general issues, if the Soviet government deems it necessary to discuss them, it can send another representative to China, and the National Government is willing to discuss them as well. This is the general situation of recent negotiations with Russia. Second, let's first talk about the issue of consular jurisdiction. The majority of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' work is now completely focused on abolishing consular jurisdiction. The progress is currently smooth. This matter is closely related to Anglo-American relations. If the United Kingdom and the United States agree to abolish it, other countries will likely also be willing to support it. Currently, regarding the United States, our Minister to the United States, Wu, is directly negotiating with the US government. Regarding the United Kingdom, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is negotiating with Lampson. Both are in progress, and we hope for results. The Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires came to Beijing yesterday to discuss the abolition of consular jurisdiction. France, Brazil, and the Netherlands have not yet made clear expressions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now decided to, in the shortest possible time, follow the instructions of the National Government and publicly discuss implementation measures with the Judicial Yuan, and strive to move forward. The Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently compiling detailed tables and explanations, categorized by type, of the concessions and leased territories of various countries in China, in order to proceed with measures to recover the concessions, etc. Regarding this issue, although it is easier than abolishing consular jurisdiction, it will inevitably involve considerable difficulties. We are determined to negotiate with an indomitable revolutionary spirit and will certainly achieve our goals. Third, is the issue of reorganizing the Shanghai Provisional Court. Everyone knows that the great power of the Provisional Court is almost entirely in the hands of foreigners. Its organization is completely different from the organization of Chinese courts at all levels. It has become a kind of deformed institution in Chinese justice. It is absolutely not allowed to exist in an independent country. Therefore, the National Government decided to reorganize it and formed a committee jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Judicial Yuan to discuss reorganization matters with the countries concerned. The participating countries include the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, France, the Netherlands, and Norway. The meeting opened at 10 a.m. on December 9th of last year and held a total of twenty-eight meetings, closing on January 21st of this year. Although many difficulties were encountered, the results, although not fully meeting our country's hopes, were much better than the previous agreement. The representatives of various countries have sent the draft treaty to their respective governments for instructions. It is said that the instructions of the governments of various countries have now arrived. It is likely that it will be formally signed next week. The content will be announced after signing. The agreement on the Provisional Court that has been published in the newspapers these past two days is not very accurate. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Taihu Bandit Suppression Plan Finalized</h3>
<p>The General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, considering the Taihu Lake region to be a prosperous area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, repeatedly disturbed by lake bandits, urgently needs to dispatch heavy troops to fundamentally eliminate them. It has specially appointed Hu Zuyu, Brigade Commander of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division, as the General Commander of Bandit Suppression in Taihu Lake, and has also transferred units from the 45th Division and the 6th Division to participate in the joint suppression. After being appointed, General Commander Hu convened a bandit suppression meeting in Shanghai the day before yesterday, attended by the county magistrates and water police chiefs of the counties bordering the lake in the two provinces. Sun Zuji, the county magistrate of Wuxi, and Mao Mujun, the water police chief, were summoned to Shanghai to attend the preliminary meeting and have now returned to Wuxi separately. I visited them and learned that this meeting focused on the fundamental plan for eliminating the lake bandits. In the future, it is planned to deploy heavy troops in Wuxing, Zhejiang, and Wuxi, Jiangsu, with a brigade headquarters stationed in each. In addition, selected troops will also be dispatched to Yixing, Wujiang, and Wuxian, which border the lake, preparing to attack in multiple directions. The participating units include the 25th Regiment (Zhao Xiguang), the 28th Regiment (Yao Chunzhi), and the 29th Regiment (Zhong Yuan) of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division, as well as various regiments dispatched from the 45th Division and the 6th Division, and the directly administered artillery battalion, etc. These units, along with the police forces of the twelve counties along the lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the water police of the five districts, and the guerrilla patrols of the counties, etc., amount to more than ten regiments. The General Headquarters has also dispatched two seaplanes and land aircraft to assist in the pursuit and suppression. General Commander Hu has now agreed with Brigade Commander Sun Changjun to divide the responsibilities between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Hu will be responsible for commanding military and police affairs on the Jiangsu side, while Sun will be stationed in Zhejiang to command. It is scheduled that the military and police of all parties will simultaneously attack the bandits' nests in the lake on the 25th of this month, with a deadline of one and a half months to eliminate them. Furthermore, Hang Yi, the bandit suppression commander of the lake area in Zhejiang Province, previously received a secret report that a part of the lake bandits had returned to their old nest in Sidu Hengshan, with only a part remaining in the lake. He decided to wait for the arrival of the two special service battalions under his command before planning to suppress them. However, the waterways in Jiangsu Province are complex and branching, making it essential to plan for prevention and blockage in advance. A telegram was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government requesting that the 2nd Water Police District stationed in Wuxi dispatch warships to be stationed in the Taihu Lake Sanshan and Zeshan areas. Yesterday, District Chief Mao received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs and immediately dispatched the Zhaowu warship with three transport ships to defend Taihu Lake and join in the suppression. The 2nd Water Police District originally had the three warships Baosu, Zhaowu, and Anjing. Last winter, the Department of Civil Affairs dispatched the Fuyan warship to Wuxi to assist in defense. However, due to the cold weather and freezing last winter, the Fuyan, Baosu, and Anjing warships were all damaged by ice. The department has now ordered that the three warships be towed to Shanghai for repairs as soon as possible, and that the Jialu, Jinghu, and Hongping warships be transferred to Wuxi to increase defense.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Requests Construction of the Yuqin Railway</h3>
<p>Army Commander Liu Xiang telegraphed the Ministry of Railways some months ago, requesting the construction of the Yuqin Railway. The original telegram stated the reasons for the urgent need to construct the road, which were highly valued. It is recorded as follows: "Minister of Railways Sun Zhesheng, esteemed brother, Having recently read the proposal for the road construction plan using the Gengzi and Guanshui indemnities, and having met with the special envoy of your ministry, Ding Zaijun, the head of the Southwest Geological Survey Team, and Chen Yanguang and Zeng Kejia, members of the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Economic Survey Committee, I am delighted to learn that the central government is following the Premier's industrial plan and will use the Gengzi and Guanshui indemnities to construct the Xiangdian Railway and the Yuedian Railway, and is planning the Yuqin branch line on the Xiangdian line and the Yuliu branch line on the Yuedian line. This shows profound foresight and a grand scale. I deeply admire and look up to it. However, I have found that Sichuan is an important southwestern town with a large population and vast territory, abundant in resources. Various mineral deposits such as non-ferrous metals, coal, iron, rock salt, and petroleum are found everywhere. The southwestern part of Sichuan is close to the Kangzang mountains, which are extremely rich in mineral resources. The British have long coveted this area and have already built a branch line from the Calcutta on the main trunk road of northern India, directly to Darjeeling in Sikkim, as a passage from India to Tibet. Russia is also planning to advance further from the Central Asian Railway, penetrating our country's Xinjiang territory and connecting to southern Tibet to spy on India. Border defense is becoming increasingly urgent, and the nation's lifeline is tightening. Furthermore, for the sake of developing and facilitating the economy, politics, and national defense of the Southwest, it is appropriate to urgently catch up and construct. Xiangbo visited with arguments, and through observation, I would like to slightly modify the general plan and suggest first building the Yuqin Railway as the backbone, with the Xiangdian and Yuedian lines as its parallels. I would like to briefly explain the reasoning. The Yuqin line connects the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, running horizontally through the administrative provincial capitals of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, which is suitable for connecting the southwestern interior trunk line and controlling politics. It also has the advantage of transporting products to the sea. That is the first advantage. The Beihai fortress has railways to connect and respond to each other. It has the advantage of unobstructed communication. That will definitely strengthen national defense. Furthermore, Beihai is owned by our country and is not like Hong Kong and Haiphong, which are under the spheres of influence of the British and French, and have no room for development. It is truly the only tool for developing agriculture, industry, and commerce. That is the second advantage. By running through Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces to the sea, the three provinces will share benefits. That way, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces will no longer have the problem of competing to build the Xiangdian and Yuedian lines, and the vast Sichuan will also avoid partial neglect. That is the third advantage. The Yuedian line is 1,300 miles long and requires a construction cost of 160 million yuan. The Xiangdian line is 1,100 miles long and requires a construction cost of 150 million yuan. The Saqin and Yuliu lines have not yet been calculated. According to recent surveys, the Yuqin line is only about 100 miles long and requires a cost of about 100 million yuan. The route has been surveyed from Chongqing through Qijiang, Songkan, Tongzi, Zunyi, Guiyang, Dushan, Nandan, Hechi, Qingyuan, Qianjiang, Nanning, and to Qinzhou Bay. The slope is not large, so the cost is saved and the construction is easy. That is the fourth advantage. After the Yuqin Railway is built, gradually build from Changsha to Guiyang or from Guiyang to Kunming, and from Guangzhou Sanshui to Qianjiang or from Kunming to Qianjiang. Consider financial resources, divide the work, and implement it simultaneously. Each segment has the effect of one segment. That is the fifth advantage. Now the Yuqi highway has already started, and the highway from Wenshui to Guiyang has also been opened to traffic. The highway project from Guiyang to Guilin is also about to be completed. For the Yuqin Railway, the foundation is already roughly in place. It is easier to succeed if construction is carried out in a timely manner. That is the sixth advantage. Sichuan's products, population, and land area are many times greater than those of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong provinces. The port of Beihai is freely managed by the government and is fully controlled, which is sufficient to promote the reclamation and immigration of the Southwest, to benefit the rural economy, and to inspire mineral deposits, supplement the skewed and dilapidated economy of the Southwest, and move towards industrialization. At the same time, the business of this road can be comparable to Longhai and Jinpu, which is sufficient to enrich the national treasury's income. That is the seventh advantage. After the Yuqin Railway is built, the Chengdu-Kangding Railway can be built with the income from its business, and the Ningjing-Changdu railway can be built via Kangding Yajiang to Qianzang to Lhasa, crossing the Yarlung Tsangpo River and reaching Yadongguan, connecting with the British Darjeeling-Calcutta railways, which will open up the largest resources of Kangzang and consolidate the Southwest border defense, which will greatly benefit our country's politics, military affairs, and economy. That is the eighth advantage. Now the Longhai Railway has reached Xi'an, and the Tongpu Railway is also about to be realized. If the Qinyu Railway is connected to Chengdu-Chongqing, it can promote the connection between Chengdu and Xi'an and link with the Longhai Road. In the future, it can directly start from Haizhou, the most advantageous port on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, and connect with the British Indian Railway, forming the largest trunk line running across the interior of the country. Furthermore, in the future, by connecting with the Tongpu Line, it can also run through the Chahar-Suiyuan Special Region and the provinces of Shanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong, forming the largest trunk line running vertically through the interior of the country. This is not only in the development of southwestern transportation, but also in connecting the northeastern lifeline. That is the ninth advantage. Furthermore, when the British requested to lay the Shaxing-Guangchong lines in the second year of the Republic of China, the French had a petition to build this line. At that time, all the officials present believed that it should be actively built to avoid repeating the mistakes of Manchuria. Now Xiang is adopting public opinion, and everyone agrees. Furthermore, because it concerns the southwest, I dare to present it again in detail. Please investigate, verify, and forward it to the Lord for his wise judgment. If it is approved, please issue a clear order to specify the date for implementation so that Xiang can prepare according to the route through Sichuan, and the construction can be easily successful. The Southwest is fortunate, and Sichuan is fortunate. I am eagerly awaiting your instructions. Your brother, Liu Xiang, kowtows."</p>
<h3>Ma Hongkui's Troops Move from Xu to Anhui</h3>
<p>The First Division, led by Xu Tingyao, arrives in Xuzhou with the Division Headquarters.</p>
<p>The Third Division began entering Xuzhou City on the 10th to garrison.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: There had been rumors for some time about the transfer of Ma Hongkui's 11th Army stationed in Xuzhou. Ma himself went to Beijing a few days ago to pay respects to Chiang and to inquire about his mother's illness. He returned to Xuzhou yesterday morning and immediately ordered his troops to pack up and move out. According to sources in the 11th Army, Ma Fuxiang has been appointed as the Chairman of Anhui Province, and Ma Hongkui has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Anhui Province. Ma's entire force is moving to Anhui. Four trains on the Jinpu Railway are being used for round-trip transportation. The infantry will first take the train to Linhuai Pass and then transfer to Anqing. The cavalry will travel overland to Shouzhou. This morning (the 10th), the 1st Regiment (Lu Zhongliang), the 2nd Regiment (Li Decang), and the mortar battalion (Che Youde) of Ma Quanliang's 1st Brigade of the 64th Division have already departed south on three trains. The 3rd Regiment (Ma Yizhong), the training regiment (Li Yuying), the engineering battalion (Wang Xiangsheng), and the artillery battalion (Jin Zhongren) will follow. The 4th, 5th, and 6th Regiments of Ma Baolin's 2nd Brigade will be dispatched after the first batch of transport trains returns to Xuzhou. Ma Hongkui will wait until his troops have finished departing before leading the army headquarters and the special service regiment (Wang Tingru) to the south. Today, the various units are boarding trains at the Jiulishan Barracks, and the transport is very busy. It will probably take three or four days to complete the transport. Starting today, the city defense of Xuzhou will be handed over by the 64th Division and taken over by the 3rd Division.</p>
<p>The 2nd Brigade (Tang Junde) of the First Division has arrived in Xuzhou. The 1st Brigade (Hu Zongnan) is continuing to depart from Pukou. This morning, Xu Tingyao, the deputy commander of the First Division, and Liu Defang, the chief of staff of the Division Headquarters, also led personnel from the Division Headquarters and the special service battalion on a special train to Xuzhou, setting up the Division Headquarters at the Zhejiang Guild Hall's art school. Personnel from the staff, adjutant, quartermaster, military law, and medical departments have arrived in Xuzhou one after another. The directly subordinate artillery battalion (Chen Xiaojiang) has also arrived south of Xuzhou. Other units are arriving in succession. According to Xu, when interviewed at the station, Liu Zhi, the Commander-in-Chief, will not arrive in Xuzhou for several days. In addition to the headquarters moving to Xuzhou, the newly formed 23rd Division (Li Yunjie), the Independent 12th Brigade (Peng Jinliu), the Independent 14th Brigade (Peng Qibiao), and the 1st Cavalry Brigade (An Juncai) will also be transferred to Xuzhou for garrison.</p>
<p>Chen Jicheng arrived in Xuzhou and set up the Division Headquarters at the old site of the Wu Clan Elementary School in the South Gate. His troops have also all arrived. Since the 11th Army has moved south, Chen's Division Headquarters has moved to the old Daoyin Office in the city to take over city defense. His 8th Brigade (Li Yutang) has moved west to Huangkou to take over the defense left by the 11th Army. Part of the 9th Brigade is still defending south of Xuzhou. (10th)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Arrives in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government will be established after the National Government's official order arrives in Hubei.</p>
<p>The Wuhan Garrison will be temporarily represented by He.</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Chengjun previously went to Beijing from Hankou to report to Chairman Chiang on the military operations against Tang Shengzhi and to request to resign from his concurrent position as Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government. Chiang personally comforted him and persuaded him to stay. The Hubei Provincial Government happened to be reorganized by a resolution of the Central Political Conference, with He still serving as the chairman. After completing his mission in Beijing, He took the Jiangyu steamer west on the 7th with Wang Jinyu, the commander of the 9th Army. Because he went to Anhui to meet with Wu Xingya, the newly appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Hubei, and stayed for a short time, he did not arrive in Hankou until 3:00 p.m. on the 10th. After landing, He, Wang Jinyu, Xu Yuanquan, and Chiang Ting-wen took a car to the office of the Provincial Government in Hankou for a rest. Important military and political figures rushed to the office and had a long talk with He. I also visited shortly afterward. He's comments were as follows: (A) Regarding provincial affairs: (I asked) The central government has recently announced the members of the Hubei Provincial Government. Please introduce their brief histories. (He replied) I was not consulted in advance about the members appointed by the central government, but the central government was very cautious in its selection. For example, Wu Xingya, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, has followed the Premier for many years, then followed Chairman Chiang, and has made many achievements. He is currently the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Anhui Province and has served as acting chairman several times, with outstanding political reputation. Zhang Guanshi, the Director of the Finance Department, assisted Chiang in everything when he ran the Whampoa Military Academy. During the Northern Expedition, he served in various military supply positions. Huang Jianzhong, the Director of the Education Department, is currently the Director of the Education Department and has been involved in education for many years with Cai Yuanpei and Chiang Menglin. The only ones who came to Hubei with me this time are General Wang Jinyu and various staff members. (Asked) When will the new provincial government be established? (Answered) The National Government has not yet formally issued the order to reorganize the Hubei Provincial Government. I have ordered Chief Secretary Hua to telegraph Beijing to urge its early promulgation so that there is a basis for establishing the new provincial government as soon as possible. Before the National Government's order arrives in Hubei, I have ordered the directors of the various departments to hand over their affairs first to avoid interruption. (Asked) It is rumored that Peng Jieshi has been appointed as the Chief Secretary of the Provincial Government. Is this true? (Answered) It has not yet been decided. (Asked) Mr. He, will you return to Hubei this time to focus on provincial affairs, or to focus on military affairs, or to take care of both? (Answered) I have never been familiar with politics and have firmly declined several times to the central government, but my request was not granted, so I have no choice but to work hard. Fortunately, the military situation is now stable, so I can take care of both provincial government and military affairs. (Asked) Will the entire province's pacification affairs be handled by the provincial government? How will the troops be distributed? (Answered) The pacification of Hubei was previously handled by the Second Route Headquarters. Now that the Second Route has been transferred to the Jinpu Line, it will be the responsibility of the Wuhan Headquarters. As for how the pacification troops will be distributed, I have consulted with the Commander-in-Chief in Beijing and have made a general decision. It is also planned to complete the pacification work in three months. (Asked) It is rumored that Xu Yuanquan will be appointed as the Commander of the Provincial Garrison. Is this true? (Answered) Xu Yuanquan is currently serving as the Garrison Commander of the southern section of the Pinghan Line. The rumor about the Commander of the Provincial Garrison is not true. When I was in Beijing, because the candidate for the Wuhan Garrison Commander was not yet determined, I asked the Commander-in-Chief for instructions. I was informed that Director Liu had canceled this title when he took over the Wuhan Garrison. The Executive Yuan also has a resolution that no garrison commanders should be established in the provinces. Currently, only Beiping retains this title. (B) Regarding military affairs: (Asked) Will the troops of the Fifth Route Army be transferred to Hubei recently? (Answered) The 47th Division (Wang Jinyu) has been transferred to Xiangyang. General Wang has resigned from his position as Chairman of Anhui Province during this trip to Beijing. The 48th Division (Xu Yuanquan) and the New 4th Division (Liu Guitang) have been transferred to garrison the southern section of the Pinghan Line. The 54th Division (Wei Yisan) and the 14th Division (Liu Chunrong) have been transferred to garrison near Wusheng Pass. (Asked) Before Director He comes to Hankou, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Ting-wen is temporarily acting as the head of the Wuhan Headquarters. Chiang's Second Army and Ninth Division have heavy responsibilities, and his old illness has relapsed. He has repeatedly telegraphed Beijing to firmly decline. It is rumored that Mr. He will take over. Is this true? (Answered) Director He is still in charge of the Wuhan Headquarters. General Chiang is only acting as the head. Now that he has firmly declined, I will be responsible in the future. It will only be a short-term agency. (Asked) Who will command Yue Weijun's and Li Yunlong's troops in the future? (Answered) All troops in Hubei are under the command of the Wuhan Headquarters. At this point, I excused myself. It is reported that Mr. He will go to the Provincial Government on the morning of the 11th to inspect and convene a first conversation meeting with the members in Hubei to discuss the organization of the provincial government.

<h3>Li Liejun Fights Fiercely with Bandits in His Hometown</h3>
<p>Liu Zhi Sends Independent 16th Brigade to Aid from Yangxin</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Li Liejun returned to Jiangxi from Beijing last year and has been reading and writing in his hometown, Wuning County, and co-authoring the History of the Great War of the Republic of China with his Japanese friend Inoue. However, Wuning is located in northern Jiangxi, between Ruichang and Xiushui, and is connected to Yangxin and Tongshan in southern Hubei. The mountains are dense, and transportation is obstructed, making it an area where bandits and communists frequently appear. In January of last year, dozens of shops in Li Xi, in that county, were burned down by bandits, leaving not a single tile remaining. As a result, there were rumors that Li had been kidnapped by bandits. Those who had known Li inquired about it, but in fact, Li was safe and sound. In May of last year, Li moved to Mount Lu to live until the autumn when the weather on Mount Lu became too cold, and he returned to Wuning to handle local autonomy and continue to build the Wuning-Automobile Road (from Wuning to the Jiabu Station of the Nanshan Railway, which is two-thirds completed). Recently, due to the relatively small number of troops stationed in northern Jiangxi, bandits and communists have been rampant. At the beginning of this month, a large group of local bandits, more than a thousand, from the border between Jiangxi and Hubei attacked Wuning very fiercely. Li, who had been a soldier for a long time, remained calm and ordered the captain of the county's Security Brigade to quickly supervise the team to suppress the bandits. At the same time, he personally led his pistol and mobile machine gun guards to supervise the battle, which greatly boosted morale. The fighting was very fierce. The Captain of the Security Brigade, unfortunately, was shot and killed. Li continued to advance and finally repelled the bandits. According to sources in political circles, Li is deeply afraid that the bandits will come again and has telegraphed Liu Zhi, the Commander-in-Chief in Hankou, and Chairman Lu and Division Commander Zhang in Nanchang, requesting them to send troops to suppress the bandits immediately. It is reported that Liu, after receiving the telegram, has telegraphed Deng Ying's Independent 16th Brigade, stationed in Yangxin and Tongcheng, to immediately go to Wuning to suppress the bandits and communists in that county and Tonggu. At the same time, the province has dispatched a small motorboat from Wucheng up the Xiushui River to Wucheng to welcome Li to the province or Jiujiang for a temporary stay to avoid danger and ensure his safety.

<p>Local Dispatch</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Another Country Gentleman Weakens: Mr. Lei Putong, a country gentleman, started his career from an outstanding background. His morality and literary works were greatly admired. He served in Beijing for twenty years, transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the Translation Office, and promoted from a ministerial official to a senior counselor. In the Guangxu Dingwei year, he was specially appointed as the Minister to Austria. His negotiations and diplomatic skills were admired at home and abroad. After completing his term, he returned to China and retired to his hometown, residing in the South Dike, refusing to go out. He then called himself Wei Yin. Later, when Song County was preparing to revise the local gazetteer, Mr. Lei was invited to be the editor-in-chief. Last summer, due to editing the gazetteer too much, his right arm became very painful. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away on the 30th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. The people of Songjiang all respected and mourned him. It is now reported that a memorial service will be held on the 27th of this month in the Gregorian calendar.

He is addicted to gambling and opium. The day before yesterday, he lost all his savings at a gambling den. Xia wanted to make a comeback, so he pawned the cotton quilt, clothes, and his wife's jewelry, getting more than twenty yuan, and went to the gambling den again. The result was still a defeat, and he was at a loss. He had the thought of ending his life, so he swallowed a large amount of opium the night before yesterday, intending to commit suicide. He slept until midnight when the poison took effect, and he rolled around in bed. His wife was very alarmed and immediately called a doctor for treatment. Fortunately, Xia was addicted to opium, and it did not cost him his life.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Investigating Murder for Money Case: A murder for money case occurred at Tangjia Bridge, Shiqi Tenth Section. Yesterday (the 11th) afternoon, Judge Tong Cheng held a court session to question the suspects. Wu Xirong testified, stating, "I am fifty-four years old and live at Tangjia Bridge. Axi is from the courtyard, and his son is called Bingquan. He is from his uncle's family, so his surname is Wang. I have no animosity with Wu Rukang, and there is no feud over grain transport. He said I murdered him, which is a false accusation. I was already in bed and didn't know anything about it." The judge asked, "Then how was the bloody clothing found in your house?" He replied, "I don't know. I don't want to leave either. I don't know where my son went. I don't know when he came back that night. I ate with my son that night, and he went to Qingyang to get yarn and then went to sleep. I don't know where the bloody clothing came from. The deceased is completely wronging me," and so on. Wu Axi testified, "I am fifty-nine years old and live at Tangjia Bridge. I watch the hermitage at Yueyu Terrace. I ate dinner at the hermitage on the evening of the ninth with a total of seven tables. Rukang handled the money. The Buddhist association has been going on for two years and is now complete for the year. There are more than fifty people attending the Buddhist association. After dinner, I stayed inside. I didn't see Wu Xirong, Xia Aliou, etc. Later, around 5 o'clock, I saw Wang Bingjin and Xia Aliou at the riverbank from above the latrine. I went inside. I was arrested by the security corps the next day." The judge asked, "Did you change your clothes?" Axi replied, "I didn't change. The village chief is against me and is biting me. I have a disagreement with my daughter-in-law and went out to watch the hermitage." The judge ordered the removal of his mandarin jacket, lined robe, and long gown for inspection, and there were no bloodstains. Axi testified, "The village chief is a bao head and has a grudge against me. Rukang also has a grudge because of being a director. When I saw people at the riverbank, dinner hadn't been served yet. Rukang went back after eating dinner. Rukang insisted that I was slandering him because I was on good terms with the village chief," and so on. After the interrogation, they were detained, awaiting the arrest and interrogation of Wu Bingquan and Xia Aliou. Yesterday (the 11th), the family of the deceased held a large memorial service and went to Wu Xirong's house to make a scene, taking away three cows and three pigs, having already slaughtered one, and destroying all the farming tools and other items. Xirong's wife, Huang, went to the county government yesterday to file a complaint.</p>
<p>Investigating Prison Break of Inmates: On the 31st of last month, three inmates, anti-revolutionaries Zhu Asan and Zhu Asi, and thief Zhang Abao, escaped from prison. The guard Sun Lie was arrested. In the afternoon of the 11th, Judge Tong Cheng questioned Sun Tongnian and Yang Lianzi, who were in the same cell. According to Sun Lie's testimony, "I am sixty years old and live at the entrance of Yimiao Lane. I have been a guard for more than ten years without interruption. I was very careful when I went on duty on the 31st. It happened very quickly. Warden Liu didn't collect the seal. I asked to collect the seal, but he said it didn't matter. I was guarding eighty-one people alone without anyone else. I didn't know anything about the digging of the hole. There was no hint of it. The warden didn't collect the seal, saying it was a New Year's custom. I had no bribery or connivance. Please investigate." Sun Tongnian testified, "I am in the same cell with Shen Lingen, Ren Ashi, Zhu Asi, etc. I didn't hear anything when the incident happened. Zhu Asan and Zhu Asi didn't sleep together with me at night." Yang Lianzi testified, "I was sentenced to two years for trafficking in illicit salt. Zhu Asi dug the hole. I was already asleep. That day, the prison official said he wouldn't collect the seal, saying it was a rare day all year round. It wasn't us who asked not to collect the seal," and then he said loudly, "The prison officials deduct our rations. Although we are supposed to get 1 jiao and 1 fen per day, we only get 15 liang of rice at most. They deduct 3 liang from us. We demand adjustment." The judge ordered them to be remanded and told them to behave themselves before adjourning.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Large Number of Refugees Arrive at Shuangqiao: More than a thousand refugees suddenly arrived at Shuangqiao Town, about eight or nine li outside the North Gate of Jiaxing, at around 6 PM the other day. They arrived on one hundred and thirty-six boats. These refugees were all from Funing, Jiangsu. After the boats docked, the refugees disembarked one after another. The residents of the town were greatly alarmed. The police chief of the stationed Public Security Branch, along with the police, persuaded and stopped the refugees from disembarking while reporting to the Third Public Security Bureau. Director Chen telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau to dispatch a police detachment to the town for suppression. The next morning, village chief Wu Xiaoting handed over 55 yuan to Yang Xushu, the general representative of the refugees, as food rations and urged them to leave the area. The refugees then boarded their original boats and headed towards Wangjiangjing and Songjiang.</p>
<p>Tian Qingting Files Another Appeal: Jiaxing Jianqiao Elementary School had 1,000 yuan stolen from its savings account in August of last year. Including the lost cash, the total was 1,119 yuan.

The court summoned Tian for questioning and sentenced him to one year and two months in prison and ordered him to repay the money. Tian appealed the verdict, and the Hangzhou County Local Branch Court summoned witnesses and held a hearing. The appeal was rejected, and the original verdict was upheld. It is now known that Tian has filed another appeal with the High Court.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Reasons for Dismissal of Prison Official: Wang, the prison official of Jiashan County Government, was usually negligent in his duties. On the 6th of last month, Warden Xu, along with inmate Sun Laosi, was escorting foreign socks to the Huihe Sock Factory at the worksite. They privately released the inmate, who did not return for ten days. When the official became anxious and searched for him, the inmate's whereabouts were unknown. It was difficult to conceal the matter, so he reported it to County Magistrate Wu, who ordered a thorough search. The inmate was found in Shanghai and escorted back to Jiashan. After interrogation by the County Court, the inmate confessed that Warden Xu had allowed him to go out to borrow money and find a way to make a living in Shanghai. When Xu was questioned, his answers were evasive, and he was immediately dismissed from his post and ordered to await further legal action. The superiors, considering that Prison Warden Wang had failed to manage the prison effectively, ordered his dismissal and transfer to the provincial capital, and Xiao was appointed to fill the vacancy, scheduled to take over on the 15th.</p>
<p>Refugee Disturbance Suppressed and Deported: More than a hundred refugees from Huai and Si were causing disturbances in the northern part of the county, stealing chickens, seizing ducks, picking up rice, and taking firewood. Yesterday, they lingered and caused trouble in the Lujia River area. Village farmers urgently reported to the Xitang Public Security Branch, who went to suppress them and deport them.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Trial of Rioters in Liuheng: The residents of Liuheng Island in Dinghai gathered in a riot. Commander Wang sent a warship together with the County Magistrate of Dinghai, leading more than four hundred soldiers and police to suppress the riot and capture ninety rioters, who were taken to the county for detention. It is now known that Wu Chun, the County Magistrate of Dinghai, brought many official documents to the province yesterday to report the details. He also sent his secretary, He Runzhang, to act as his deputy and invited representatives from various public organizations and the party to interrogate the rioters from Liuheng Island, starting at 8 AM on the 9th. The interrogation continued until 7 PM. It resumed at 7 AM the next morning and concluded at 12 PM. During the interrogation, more than ten people, including Hu Dabing and Zhang Ashui, confessed without hesitation, saying that Wang Gengkui and others were indeed local bullies in Liuheng and that killing them would eliminate harm. After the interrogation, more than seventy people were shackled. However, the shackles previously owned by the Dinghai County Office were insufficient, so Tie Zuo was asked to rush to make three pairs of shackles each, which is truly a major prison case that has never happened before.</p>
<p>Kidnapping and Assault Case in Yaobei: Chen Xianlu of Gaowang Town, Yaobei, runs a wine and rice shop at home and has considerable savings. His eldest son, Chen Anji, is currently a clerk at the Jiangsu Shatien Official Property Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. He returned home on the 5th to visit his relatives. On the evening of the 6th, six bandits suddenly entered the shop and grabbed the shop owner Chen Xianlu and his youngest son Chen Bingji, demanding 500 yuan. Bingji pretended to go inside to get the money and took the opportunity to escape. The bandits, waiting for the youngest son to come out, kidnapped the old miser Chen Xianlu and fired a shot into the air as a warning. Chen's son, Anji, happened to be at a dinner party at a neighbor's house. Hearing the sound of gunfire at home, he hurried home. Just as he reached the front door, the bandits fired a shot, and the bullet pierced his left flank. He was still able to swim across the river to escape. The bandits then kidnapped Chen Xianlu and fled south. After his eldest son, Anji, escaped by swimming, neighbors carried him home, where he was unconscious. Yesterday, his family invited a doctor to diagnose him, who said that his lung corner was injured. If his fever does not increase, he may be saved.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Sending Government-Funded Students</h3>

<h3>Party and Education Authorities Host Farewell Dinner for Party Members Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters and the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau hosted a farewell banquet at the East Asia Restaurant yesterday for Party members, revolutionary youth dispatched by the Central Government to study abroad. Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, Wu Bokang, Zhu Yingpeng, Tang Demin, Hou Dachun and other members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Municipal Party Headquarters; Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Secretary Zheng Hechun, heads of various departments, all superintendents; and Party members studying abroad, Cao Liying, Zhao Shu and other guests, totaling more than 50 people. The seating began at 12:00 PM. Halfway through the dinner, Chairman Chen Dezheng rose to give a farewell speech, stating that the Party's dispatch of Party members to study abroad this time truly set a new record in the Party's history. Therefore, the mission undertaken by these comrades studying abroad is different from that of ordinary students studying abroad. Like ordinary students studying abroad, all of you have received higher education, but because you have participated in actual revolutionary movements, you understand both the special circumstances of China and the adaptation of the Party's revolutionary movement to China's special circumstances. All of you have returned from the front lines of the revolution to the reserves to cultivate your spirit and prepare your intellect. The future development of the Party in all aspects and the realization of the Three Principles of the People will depend on your efforts. You should understand that in the current period, the Party governs politics, politics serves education, education serves politics, and the Party establishes education. Your fundamental efforts will be even more helpful to the education that the Party values. In the past, the Party and education seemed to be separate, but in reality, the Party cannot be separated from education, nor can education be separated from the Party. The mission undertaken by those studying abroad is to promote education from the Party's standpoint and to clarify the Party's principles in the field of education. Therefore, both the Party and education have high hopes for the comrades studying abroad. Today, the Party and education are hosting a banquet for comrades studying abroad who are of great importance to both the Party and education. The significance of this is self-evident. Therefore, I hope that all comrades present will not forget this banquet and will not forget the different and special mission that Party members studying abroad undertake compared to ordinary students studying abroad.</p>
<p>Next, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, the main points of which can be divided into three points: 1. Today, China urgently needs scientific talents. You must adopt their strengths and discard their weaknesses when studying abroad. 2. Current Party and government workers are like laborers engaged in the construction of the foundation. In the future, you will all be specialists, and the major affairs of the Party and the country will rely on your leadership. Therefore, you must cooperate with each other to achieve great things. 3. When you return to China after completing your studies, you will definitely benefit the Party and the country. You can continue to work hard as current Party and government workers. Subsequently, Wang Ke, a standing committee member of the Student Management Office, gave a speech. Cao Liying and Zou Degao, representatives of the students studying abroad, gave thank-you speeches. A group photo was taken to commemorate the occasion. The event ended in joy at 4:00 PM.</p>

The remaining representatives from various organizations discussed until 6:00 PM and decided to invite businessmen from France, Japan, Italy, and Germany to attend the formal discussion on Sino-foreign cooperation on relief methods next Monday (the 17th).

Then, Xu Jianping, representing Kong Xiangxi, was introduced to give a welcome speech. Subsequently, various foreign businessmen expressed their opinions, which are summarized as follows: (1) To relieve the crisis, China itself should quickly restore transportation so that accumulated goods can be circulated at home and abroad. (2) Onerous taxes and miscellaneous levies should be abolished as soon as possible to develop domestic goods. (3) Half-dollar coins should be minted, and banks should have sufficient cash reserves when issuing banknotes.</p>

The opinions put forward by the representatives of the Bureau of Social Affairs were: (1) Prohibit the import of silver bullion; (2) Restrict the issuance of banknotes except by national banks; (3) Restrict trading on gold and silver exchanges. After discussion, it was agreed to first submit the next proposal so that opinions could be put forward at the next formal meeting. Zhao Jinqing then stipulated three proposals for the next formal meeting: (1) From the perspective of foreign businessmen, what policies should the Chinese government use to relieve the decline in silver prices, and what recommendations should China make at the exchange rate joint meeting of this year's League of Nations? (2) In what ways can Chinese and foreign businessmen in China work together to relieve the silver crisis?</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Tariff Negotiations</h3>
<p>Both Sides' Opinions Are Quite Close</p>
<p>Awaiting Instructions from the Japanese Government</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the Sino-Japanese tariff issue is one of the most important issues in the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty. Since repeated consultations between Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu and Ministers Song and Wang, a general compromise has been reached. The Japanese side has also agreed to and formally promised to resolve the preliminary issues raised by China. In recent days, they have been separately telegraphing each other about the types and rates of goods subject to reciprocal tariffs. On one hand, Consul Uemura in Beijing is negotiating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance nearby, which has been quite satisfactory. The opinions of both sides are very close. Yesterday, Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report the details and request instructions. It is expected that a reply will be received in Shanghai within this week. Once approved, the date for signing the agreement will be determined, and negotiations on treaty revision will begin.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Silver Coins Will Continue to Arrive from Saigon</h3>
<p>Five Million Have Already Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, the Banque de l'Indochine shipped five million silver coins from Saigon. It is reported that a large batch of silver coins will continue to arrive in Shanghai. The bank initially planned to entrust the melting of the silver coins to various silver smelters. However, after repeated discussions on prices, no agreement was reached. Initially, the silver smelters set the price at 7 mace, 1 fen, 3 li, 2 hao, and a half. Later, after trial melting, they decided to abandon the deal because there was no profit to be made. It is now reported that the bank has entrusted the mint to conduct tests.</p>

<h3>Hua Shang Pudong Two Companies Sign Power Supply Contract</h3>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company is not large in scale, and its power generation is not very economical, resulting in high electricity prices. Local people have expressed dissatisfaction. The company is following the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau's plan to unify the city's power plants, and is negotiating with the Hua Shang Electric Company to supply power, in order to reduce costs and potentially lower electricity prices. Recently, the two companies agreed to lay a cross-river cable in the Dongjiadu area, stipulating that the project will be completed and power will be supplied within one year. The power supply contract has also been agreed upon by both parties and submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval and filing.</p>

<h3>Mayor Zhang Adopts the Tax Reduction Opinions of the Shanghai Municipal Business Reorganization Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Business Reorganization Council previously sent a letter to Mayor Zhang regarding the issue of donation taxes in the city, expressing opinions in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. Mayor Zhang agreed to adopt the opinions, and the Business Reorganization Council sent a reply to express gratitude. The original correspondence is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor's Letter to the Business Reorganization Council: In response, I have carefully read your letter and am well aware of your opinions. It demonstrates your council's concern for municipal affairs and consideration for the people's hardships, which is deeply admirable. Your letter earnestly advocates for the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. This can indeed serve as a guideline for financial management and is also what the municipal government adheres to as a principle. The current tax system in Shanghai mostly follows the old regulations of the former Shanghai North Industrial and Patrol Donation Bureau and the Nanshi Municipal Office. Since the situation is different now than in the past, there should be room for deliberation and improvement. In July 1928, a resolution was passed at the municipal affairs meeting to establish a Finance Committee to discuss the nature and collection procedures of various donation taxes. Subsequently, a general outline for reorganization was drafted, with the aim of abolishing harsh and minor taxes, which coincides with the advocacy of your council. Therefore, whenever a tax system is formulated, it is always examined to see if it conforms to this principle in order to determine whether to adopt or reject it. Furthermore, since it concerns increasing the burden on citizens, opinions from all parties must be gathered in order to make a decision. The finalized cases are on record and can be verified. Now, I will try to explain the process of the various donation taxes mentioned in your letter to your council in general terms. (1) Cattle and Sheep Inspection Fees: Originally, the city only had a pig slaughter tax, which was collected by the Shanghai County Office. After the establishment of the city, in order to ensure public food hygiene, regulations for slaughtering and inspection of livestock were formulated, first for the pig industry and then for the cattle and sheep industry. Since various technical drugs are required during the inspection, it is necessary to charge fees to cover the costs. For cattle and sheep transported to the concession, pre-slaughter inspection is implemented, the purpose of which is to protect the health of Chinese citizens in the concession. Its nature is a handling fee, not a donation tax. The Finance Bureau convened a meeting with all parties, and your council sent representatives to attend the discussion before the final decision was made. If inspecting and slaughtering livestock is deemed a necessary task, then charging fees is a natural result. If there are any aspects of the fee collection procedure that are deemed unsatisfactory, then the method is not immutable and can be improved. (2) Ship Donation Tax: The city's ship donation tax was originally a type of special donation for public welfare during the Qing Dynasty's self-government office era. After the establishment of the city, it was reorganized for the sake of unified collection. In August of last year, the ship donation tax regulations were revised again. In order to regulate ships, the Public Utilities Bureau drafted regulations for inspecting ships and ship license regulations, which were submitted for promulgation. Shipowners complained that the donation rate was too high, causing disputes. The Finance Bureau invited all parties concerned to meet at your council to jointly study the matter. However, since the sixth and seventh classes were relatively high, they were reduced separately. However, the shipowners still held different opinions. After further discussion by the government, it was determined that inspection was crucial to water safety and could not be suspended, while the donation rate could be reduced. Subsequently, it was decided that the donation rates for the first, second, third, and fourth classes would remain the same, the fifth class would be reduced to 2.75 yuan, the sixth class would be reduced to 3.57 yuan, and the seventh class would be reduced to 4.22 yuan. The license fee was reduced to 3 yuan. All registration procedures will still be handled in accordance with the methods agreed upon by all parties at your council on that day, with simplicity and speed as the main principles. All shipowners who pay taxes at the original donation rate should be reimbursed based on the receipt to demonstrate fairness, and this has been notified by the city in a separate case. (3) Banquet Donation Tax: The establishment of the city's banquet donation tax originally came from the construction of merchants. According to the Finance Bureau's report, Dafugui Restaurant and others jointly submitted a petition stating that banquet donation taxes had been established in the capitals of Hangzhou and Guangzhou for a long time. The Shanghai urban area is prosperous, and there are many banquets. It is proposed to imitate them. After detailed discussion by the bureau, it was deemed feasible. The proposed donation rate is 5% for each banquet worth more than 3 yuan. This donation tax is levied on diners, not on shops, so its nature is a consumption tax. Your letter mistakenly considers it to be a business tax. This donation tax has been implemented in other provinces, and it is appropriate to imitate it in order to increase the city's revenue. However, whether it has a significant impact on the business of shops should be considered. Since you have given instructions, it should be reconsidered in order to be most appropriate. (4) Incense, Candles, and Firecrackers Business Tax: The Finance Bureau is responsible for taxation throughout the city and can investigate the status of various businesses at any time. This tax item has not been implemented in the city. Your letter is a misunderstanding. Most of the above donation taxes that have been implemented have been discussed with the participation of your council. All instructions have been implemented. It is the city government's consideration of commercial conditions, with absolutely no prejudice. This can be understood by your council. Furthermore, the city has only been established for three years, and various undertakings are expanding day by day. Municipal administration cannot be carried out without funds. The way to increase the city's revenue is nothing more than expanding sources and reducing expenditures. But in terms of expanding sources, the local government cannot rely mainly on tax revenue. If what is levied fully complies with the principles of taxation, then it cannot be said to be harming the people. The increase in the burden on the people is unavoidable in the construction process. The balance between the consequences of sacrificing enjoyment and the benefits and obligations depends on a long-term vision, and planning should be long-term. You are all intelligent and should have insight into this. However, the situation in the city is special. On the one hand, the concessions have not yet been recovered. On the other hand, although the administrative powers of the province and city have been divided, the Jiangsu provincial tax collection agencies are still located in the city, resulting in disparate tax systems and increased burdens. Therefore, it is not easy to comply with the principles of fairness and universality, no matter what tax is implemented. This is why the city government is so careful in considering things repeatedly. Regarding the wharf donation, it is currently in progress and has just begun. It can live up to your expectations and recover lost rights. In terms of reducing expenditures, the city's budget increases year by year due to the expansion of operations. The allocation of its expenditures follows a certain standard. The city is made up of the people, and the government is established by the people. All measures are aimed at increasing the welfare of the citizens. Therefore, what is taken from the people</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>should be used for the people. This is what the city government dares to sincerely tell you. As for the various bureaus and personnel used by the city government, they are all based on the special city organization law promulgated by the central government. There are no additional agencies, and the annual budget makes every effort to save on administrative expenses. At this time when the revolution has not yet succeeded, those who serve the city should have the spirit of hard work and struggle. For the sake of their own welfare, citizens should have a willingness to cooperate in the implementation of municipal facilities. Your council leads the people and knows the people's feelings. Your earnest instructions are of great benefit to the city. I am sending this brief reply in the hope that you will give it your attention. Sincerely, Zhang Qun.</p>
<p>Reply from the Business Reorganization Council to the Mayor: To Mayor, with respect and humility, I previously ventured to comment on the city's tax affairs because I witnessed the people's strength declining and heard the masses' appeals every day. I was afraid that my words were激切 and would offend your dignity. However, I received a reply with earnest encouragement, stating that the city's situation is special, the tax system is disparate, and the burden is increased. It is difficult to comply with the principles of fairness and universality, no matter what tax is implemented, which demonstrates your concern for the people's hardships at all times. Your humility and sincerity are comparable to those of former sages. I look up to you from below with endless admiration. Later, I received two clear orders, for the ship donation tax, to reduce the amount according to class, and for the banquet donation tax, to approve the immediate suspension of implementation, which further demonstrates the reality of taking advice as a way to improve, rather than merely comforting with warm words. After hearing the order, I was deeply moved and admired. However, no matter what tax is implemented in the city, since the situation is special and it is difficult to comply with the principles of fairness and universality, it is more difficult to promote it to the fullest extent and reduce harassment than in other cities. It seems that extra care should be taken. Rather than waiting for the donation rate to be announced and implemented, and then changing it in response to the people's requests, the procedures are difficult, and the time may be delayed. Although your kindness is conveyed, the merchants and people will inevitably suffer losses first. The matter of the ship donation tax is one example. It is better to take the opportunity when the policy has not yet been decided to first convene the relevant businesses to consult as much as possible, and then announce and implement it after the method is satisfactory and there are no obstacles. This is easier for both officials and merchants. This is the humble opinion of adopting it before the event rather than making improvements after the event. If you consider this simple view to be acceptable, I propose that in the future, all matters relating to the revision of tax regulations should first convene the relevant businesses to give them the opportunity to present the advantages and disadvantages and make as many contributions as possible, so that there will be less obstacles in advance and to highlight the goodness of making orders effective. Whether this is appropriate or not, I hope you will review and instruct us to comply.</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Commodity Inspection Prepares for the Inspection of Lace</h3>
<p>Merchants from lace factories in this city and other cities previously stated that lace is a special handicraft product of China. However, in recent years, lace merchants have not been diligent in improving the style, quality, and materials of their goods, resulting in a decline in the industry and affecting international credit. It is imperative to remedy this situation. They jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting attention to rectification and unified inspection in order to promote development. After receiving the petition, the bureau considered that the manufacturers are paying attention to developing overseas trade and voluntarily requesting the inspection of lace, which is commendable. It immediately approved the petition and prepared to set up an office for inspection. It requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to appoint Ms. Chen Jinduan as a technician and acting director, and Tao Yumen as deputy director, to actively carry out the work. Ms. Chen graduated from the Boston School of Fine Arts in the United States and studied fine arts in Paris. She has served as an art teacher at the Shanghai Chinese and Western Girls' School. Mr. Tao has been engaged in the lace business for more than ten years and has rich experience. They are currently drafting manufacturing standards for lace, drafting detailed inspection rules, and soliciting opinions from merchants. They are scheduled to send the patterns to the bureau by the 20th of this month so that they can gather wisdom and register them separately. Once the facilities are completed, inspection will be implemented on a scheduled basis.</p>
<h3>The Inspection of Raw Silk Is Postponed for One Month</h3>
<p>Implementation on March 1</p>
<p>Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to develop the European sales of Chinese silk, specially ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to set up a Raw Silk Inspection Office and scheduled to start inspecting exported raw silk on the 1st of this month. Subsequently, the Chinese silk merchants requested a postponement. Director Zou submitted a request to Minister Kong, who approved the postponement for one month, scheduling the implementation on March 1. Director Zou has notified the factory owners and silk merchants of the Yellow, White, and Gray grades.</p>
<h3>Standard for Calculating Road Construction Fees in This City</h3>
<p>No Fees Levied on Expropriated Land</p>
<p>The road construction fees in this city, previously stipulated by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works in a temporary ordinance, separately specified the percentage of road construction fees. However, the standard for calculating this percentage, whether it should be based on the original area before expropriation or the remaining area after expropriation, was not clearly defined, causing difficulties for the Bureau in handling this matter. Recently, a request was submitted to the Municipal Government to approve that the calculation standard for this item should be based on the remaining beneficial area for fair assessment and collection. The Municipal Government considered that the purpose of collecting road construction fees is that although the land has been expropriated, the value of the un-expropriated land has increased sharply due to road construction. Therefore, collecting fees is based on the mutual establishment of rights and obligations. If the land has already been expropriated, and it is still required to pay fees in accordance with the ordinance, it would be unfair to make people lose land and have to pay taxes. The Bureau has been instructed to exclude the expropriated land and only collect fees based on the percentage calculated from the remaining beneficial land.</p>

<h3>Recent News in the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>More Cargo, Fewer Ships on the Yangtze River - A considerable amount of Yangtze River cargo accumulated in Shanghai last winter has not yet been shipped. Now that the river is gradually rising, loading is being rushed. However, only four Chinese ships are available for departure these days. Many passengers and goods that cannot be loaded are being taken by foreign ships. The China Merchants Bureau has already transferred the Hai Lun Yu Shun to the Yangtze River to barely maintain commercial transportation. Yesterday, the Sanbei Company also leased the Xin Baohua wheel from the Ping An Company at a monthly rent of 4,000 yuan, with a temporary lease term of two and a half months, and also dispatched it to Shanghai and Hankou to meet passenger demand. However, the ship is relatively small and can only carry 600 tons, which is slightly better than nothing.</p>
<p>Longhai Locomotives Arrive in Shanghai - The Longhai Railway, in order to reorganize passenger cars, has purchased a batch of new locomotives from Belgium. The first batch consists of four locomotives, each weighing over 22 tons and being the latest model. Originally, they were planned to be unloaded in Pukou and transferred to Henan. However, fearing obstacles, it has been decided that when the locomotives are imported on the 15th, they will be temporarily stored in Shanghai and a way will be found to transport them later.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Pacific Shipping Turmoil</h3>
<p>The Pacific shipping turmoil caused by Japanese ship competition has been reported in this newspaper. The current competition and remedies of each wheel company will be further reported as follows:</p>
<p>Striving for Silk Loading - This turmoil started with the competition for transporting Huzhou silk. According to statistics, a total of 557,000 bales of Chinese silk were shipped to the United States last year. Based on the original price, the freight would require more than 8.8 million yuan in Chinese currency. Since the gold price increase, the amount of Chinese silk going to the United States has increased because American merchants who handle Japanese silk have switched to purchasing Chinese silk. Therefore, this year's silk export volume should be higher than last year. Since Japanese merchants have reduced freight rates, the annual freight income for silk shipped to the United States will be reduced by 7 million yuan. During this period of drastic freight rate cuts, various companies are competing fiercely for transportation. The Gorret Wheel of Xiangtai Foreign Company is carrying a full load of Huzhou silk for export to the United States this time. In the past, the freight rates for silk on Sino-American wheels were the most favorable, but now they have changed to the worst freight rates.</p>
<p>Discussing Price Reductions - Commercial wheels traveling the Shanghai-New York route have been competing fiercely with Pacific wheels in transportation since the change to express ships last year, and they also load a lot of Huzhou silk. The reduction is 5.5 US dollars per 100 pounds. It is found that companies joining this route include the Papohui William Sun Company, jointly run by Norway and the United States, the Dankel Wensheng Company, British Prince, Bank, Fort, American Standard, Ocean, and other wheel companies. Currently, each of these companies is still discussing the matter of reducing the silk transportation price to four yuan per 100 pounds, but it must be realized. Another discussion is to improve loading and transportation methods, but it has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>Remedying the Disturbance - Since the Japanese merchants lowered prices twice, various foreign wheel companies have recognized that if this continues, the wheel industry between China and the United States will face extreme danger. However, according to general observations, the Japanese are already implementing disturbances and have support to rely on. It is possible that they will further lower the prices. It is also heard that various wheel companies in the Pacific recognize that this chaotic price reduction by Japanese merchants is business competition, which is not in line with commercial regulations and loses the righteousness of commercial warfare. The companies have discussed many times and plan to have the various shipping companies in the association persuade the non-member Japanese merchants such as Kawasaki Mitsui to join the Pacific Water Foot Association to prevent them from causing further disturbances. However, the Japanese have other ideas, and persuasion may not be effective.</p>
<h3>Swiftness of European Mail</h3>
<p>Arrival in 18 Days Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that recently, mail from Europe to Shanghai via Siberia has become increasingly swift. Letters sent on January 23 can arrive in Shanghai on February 10, taking only 18 days. London newspapers published on January 24 were already in the hands of local postmen yesterday (11th), also taking only 18 days. It can be said that it has restored the old view of the fastest time of the year. Previously, mail via Siberia was privately opened three times en route, but it has not been seen again recently. However, these three cases of private opening are still being investigated by the postal authorities in London and this port, and there are still no results.</p>
<h3>Announcement from the Pharmaceutical Association to Vigorously Promote the National Calendar</h3>
<p>Eliminate Discounts on the Lunar Calendar and Issue Wages According to the National Calendar</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, in order to comply with the National Calendar and eliminate old practices, decided at a joint meeting of the Executive Discipline Committee yesterday to eliminate discounts on the lunar calendar and correct the issuance of wages to employees according to the National Calendar, and abolish all malpractices of the lunar calendar. The announcement to the industry in the city is as follows: In the matter of announcement, it has been repeatedly ordered by the central government to abolish the lunar calendar and vigorously promote the National Calendar, which should be strictly followed. However, in the old practices of our industry, there have been discounts on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar calendar and the first and fifteenth days of the solar calendar. Now that the lunar calendar has been abolished and the National Calendar is followed, there is no lunar or solar calendar, so it is essential to eliminate old practices. Therefore, the Executive Discipline Committee of this association has decided that from this year, all old practices of the lunar calendar in our industry will be eliminated, and only discounts on the first and fifteenth days of the National Calendar will be allowed. Those who violate this decision and continue the old practices will be severely punished. This decision, in addition to being submitted by this association to the Social Bureau for approval and execution, must be strictly followed by all of our colleagues. As for the elimination of old practices, the procedures are complicated, which this association is well aware of. The Secretariat is rushing to draft implementation measures to facilitate compliance. As soon as the procedures are complete, they will be implemented on a regular basis. Furthermore, the issuance of wages to employees in our industry has always followed the lunar calendar. Now, it will also be corrected and wages will be paid according to the National Calendar. However, the date of wage payment may be determined by the employer. All other malpractices related to the abolition of the lunar calendar and holidays will be fundamentally eliminated from this year onwards and must not be privately implemented in violation of the order. Use the spirit of party governance to emphasize the national government's orders. This is an important announcement.</p>

<h3>The Provisional Court Yesterday Heard the Case of a Woman Conspiring to Kill Her Stepmother</h3>
<p>The Courtroom Was Filled with Spectators</p>
<p>The Small Knife Belonged to Zhang Wenqing</p>
<p>The Bloody Handprint on the Back Door</p>
<p>The Judge Instructed the Police to Investigate</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Luo Renji, accompanied by Mr. Menghatt, the American consul acting as a trial observer, took the bench in the First Tribunal of the Provisional Court to hear the case of Zhang Wenqing, a woman who, in order to compete for inheritance, conspired with Chen Hengcai, Yao Yonggui, Gao Jintang, etc. to kill her stepmother. When the case was opened, there were many relatives and friends of both parties and staff members of the court present in the courtroom, which was full of people. The details of the case and the opening of the trial are detailed below:</p>
<p>The Story of the Case - There was a man named Zhang Fusheng from Huzhou, who served as a magistrate in Zhili during the Qing Dynasty. He had some savings. After resigning, he moved his family to Shanghai and lived at No. 762 Card Road, Xinzha. Zhang had one wife and one concubine. The wife, surnamed Su, had two daughters, the eldest, Wenqing, who is now 24 years old and not yet married, and the younger, who is married. The concubine, also surnamed Su, is 34 years old and has two sons, the eldest, Jinbao, whose style name is Wenjin, is thirteen years old, and the youngest, Qianbao, whose style name is Wenqian, is eleven years old. The wife and concubine lived together. Later, Fusheng died of illness, and disputes arose between the wife and concubine over the inheritance. Because Fusheng had several thousand taels of cash during his lifetime, deposited in the Siming Xingye Bank in Shanghai, the deposit book fell into the hands of the concubine, who refused to hand it over. Therefore, Wenqing, the eldest daughter of the wife, reported the loss to the bank. The concubine then filed a criminal complaint against her major wife in the Provisional Court. Although she was summoned, the case was eventually dismissed due to reconciliation between the two parties. Later, the major wife also filed a civil lawsuit against the concubine. As a result, at the time of reconciliation, Zhang Su suddenly died. The police detectives Lang Jin and Bao Tan Yu Changyuan from Gordon Road, who were in charge of the case, arrested the suspects Zhang Wenqing and Chen Hengcai. They confessed that the murderers Yao Yonggui and Gao Jintang were hiding in Zhenjiang. The detectives went to Zhenjiang and arrested Yao and Gao and brought them back to the police station. They were sent to the Provisional Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>Need to Ask the Eldest Daughter - The hearing continued yesterday. The family of the deceased hired two lawyers, Wang Xiangugu and others, while the defendant, Zhang Wenqing, hired three lawyers, Wang Fushang, Jiang Baoli, and Jiang Baolian, to defend her. First, the police lawyer Ru Bao-yi presented the case. Then, the witness Cai Hou-an testified that he was a pharmacist at the Red Cross Society on Xinzha Road. On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, at 6:00 PM, the injured Zhang Su was sent by Zhang Wenqing and a neighboring woman by rickshaw. According to Wenqing, she was stabbed by a thief at home. He saw that the injured had knife wounds on her head and hands. He and Gu Shiliang helped bandage the wounds. He asked the injured about the reason, who said that the eldest daughter (i.e., Wenqing) knew about it. He also saw Wenqing unbutton the injured's clothes and take away a piece of paper. After a quarter of an hour, the Chinese and Western detectives from the police station arrived and questioned the injured. He only heard the injured say that asking the eldest daughter would know about it. Gu Shiliang also testified that he was a nurse at the Red Cross Society. He only heard Zhang Wenqing ask the injured about the murderer. Before leaving, he said, "Not only will I stab you (i.e., the injured) to death, but I will also kill your two sons and me." The injured did not speak. Later, the police detective Bao arrived and asked the injured about the reason for being stabbed and whether there was any illicit relationship. The injured replied that she needed to ask the eldest daughter.</p>
<p>Tricked into the Parlor - Yu Changyuan, the police detective, testified that he and the Western detective chief Mike Wailen went to the Red Cross Society at 7:00 PM that night to question the injured. According to her, Chen Hengcai knew the eldest young lady Wenqing. At that time, Hengcai's aunt's brother Yonggui brought an unknown person. They tricked her into the parlor, and the unknown person suddenly stabbed her with a knife.</p>
<p>Testimony of the Eldest and Youngest Sons - Zhang Jinbao, the eldest son of the deceased, testified that he was thirteen years old. He called Wenqing "eldest sister." When his mother was attacked, he was out playing. At 6:00 PM, he and his younger brother returned home and entered through the back door. Yao Yonggui opened the door, and Yao immediately ran away with an unknown person. He went to the back patio and saw his eldest sister running down from upstairs and saw his mother lying on the ground. When his mother saw his brothers, she called his name several times and told him to go to his maternal uncle's place. The unknown person was the fourth defendant, Gao Jintang. The younger son, Zhang Qianbao, also testified.</p>
<p>Held the Knife and Stabbed to Death - Yao Yonggui, the defendant, testified that he was from Zhenjiang and lived at No. 751 Kangnao Road in Shanghai, where he opened a tiger stove. Chen Hengcai was a relative of his. He did not often go to the Zhang family's house. On that day, Hengcai came and asked him to fight at Card Road. He went to Zhang's house with Gao Jintang. The door was wide open. He entered. There was no one else downstairs. He talked to the deceased. Not long after, Gao held a knife and stabbed the deceased violently. At that time, the eldest and youngest ladies were upstairs, and Chen Hengcai was in the kitchen. He returned to his hometown the next day. Judge Luo asked Yao, "According to Chen Hengcai's testimony, you held the deceased's hand and Gao stabbed her with force. Is that true?" Yao replied no.</p>
<p>Waiting Outside the Door - Gao Jintang testified that he was from Zhenjiang and worked at a tiger stove on Kangnao Road. He lived not far from Yao Yonggui and was from the same hometown as Chen Hengcai. On that day, Hengcai and Yonggui came and invited him to play. They passed by the Zhang family's door. The two of them went inside, and he waited outside the door. After a while, the two of them came out again and told him to leave quickly. He did not know anything else.</p>
<p>Did Not Return the Deposit Book - Zhang Wenqing testified that she was twenty-four years old. Her father, Zhang Fusheng, had died many years ago. Her mother, Su, was taken by her stepmother last year because she was ill. After her mother recovered, her stepmother refused to return the deposit book. She reported the loss to the bank. There were more than 5,000 taels in Siming Bank and more than 2,000 taels in Xingye Bank. Her stepmother then filed a criminal complaint against her mother, but the case was reconciled later.</p>
<p>Dowry Fee Has Been Paid - Her mother also filed a civil lawsuit, ordering the return of management rights and the deposit book. Later, the two parties reached an agreement and withdrew the case. The condition was to pay 1,500 taels of silver as her dowry and 1,000 taels for her mother's living expenses. But although her expenses had been paid and given to her, her mother's living expenses had not been paid and were still managed by her stepmother.</p>
<p>Borrowed Money to Open a Bookstore - After that, her relationship with her stepmother returned to normal and there were no more opinions. Therefore, she really had no intention of killing her stepmother. At the end of November last year, Chen Hengcai wanted to borrow 1,500 taels of silver from her stepmother to open a bookstore. She interjected, saying that her stepmother should not lend it to him, so she refused. Hengcai held a grudge and wanted to use a pistol against her stepmother.</p>
<p>Stepmother Wanted to Flee - But in October last year, Wang Dabao, the nephew of her stepmother, told her that Su Xiangnian, her stepmother's brother, wanted to harm her because of a lawsuit. In November, she heard Hengcai say that her stepmother wanted to take everything and live elsewhere.</p>
<p>The Small Knife Belongs to Her - She was upstairs when she heard Yao Yonggui talking to her stepmother downstairs. Not long after, she heard an alarm and went downstairs. Yonggui and the others were gone. Her stepmother was lying on the ground with knife wounds. She and a neighboring woman took her to the Red Cross Society for treatment. The small knife used to commit the crime was hers, but it was placed in the drawer of the dressing table and stolen by Hengcai.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing Started the Idea - Chen Hengcai testified that the killing of Su was Zhang Wenqing's idea. They had been discussing it for two months. Because of the lawsuit, she asked him to help her and said that she could pay him. She told him to call someone to kill Su, and she agreed to give him 400 yuan, with 50 yuan paid in advance. At 4:45 that afternoon, he gave Gao Jintang 20 yuan in a nearby alley. At that time, he and Yonggui were together. The murder weapon was given to Gao Jintang by Wenqing at this time. The three of them entered Zhang's house together. He did not go with them.</p>
<p>Investigating the Bloody Handprint - Finally, Judge Luo summoned the deceased's younger brother, Su Yaoting, for questioning. After the lawyers for both parties questioned the above people, it was getting late. Judge Luo said that according to Su Yaoting's complaint, there were still bloody handprints on the door of Zhang's house. He then announced that the case would be postponed and instructed the police to investigate whether there were any handprints on the door, and to summon witnesses for continued questioning. After the announcement, the court was adjourned and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Chen Sun Case in Suzhou Will Have Bones Steamed for Examination</h3>
<p>Chen Shuangxi, nicknamed Jiangbei the Great King, who opened a teahouse in Suzhou's Changmen, had a son named Chen Xueshi, who married Chen Sun, the daughter of Sun Zhengwen from the Hengshun Cigarette Paper Shop on Laiyuan Bridge in Xumen. In February of last year, Chen Sun suddenly died. The Chen family claimed that she had hanged herself, while the Sun family claimed that she had been strangled to death. They reported it to the Wuxian District Court for examination, which found that she had hanged herself. The court then acquitted her. The Sun family did not accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court and the Supreme Court, but both were rejected. The Sun family still refused to accept the verdict and insisted that she had been strangled to death and requested a transfer of jurisdiction. Now, the higher court has designated the Shanghai District Court to investigate. However, the body should be re-examined. Therefore, the two parties were summoned the day before yesterday, and Prosecutor Yang opened the court for preliminary examination and ordered them to sign a guarantee to transport the coffin to Shanghai for steaming the bones for examination. The two parties have complied with the order and went to Suzhou to transport the body to the District Court. Because the procedure of steaming the bones is very complicated, the General Affairs Office was ordered yesterday to hire workers to build stoves, etc. As soon as the coffin arrives at the court, the steaming examination will be carried out.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Robbers Gu Changchun, Zhou Cailao, Yu Zhongjin, etc., kidnapped Zhu Maosheng's eight-year-old son Desheng, the owner of the Laoda Fang Tea and Food Shop at No. 864 and a half, Mengnala Road, at noon on December 11th of last year. They hid him in a house at No. 79 Shoxiang Lane, Fangbang Road, in the Chinese territory. Later, detective Feng Zhiming and others from the Laozha Police Station cracked the case, and together with Ge Wangshi, the woman guarding the hostage, they were brought to the Provisional Court for investigation and trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Gao Junxiang opened the court and pronounced the verdict: Gu, Zhou, and Yu, the three robbers, were each sentenced to death, and Ge Wangshi was sentenced to life imprisonment. After the judgment, they were ordered to be separately detained, pending submission for approval and execution.</p>
<h3>Robbers in the Zheng Ruijuan Kidnapping Case Could Not Be Identified</h3>
<p>Zheng Ruijuan, the daughter of Zheng Xitang of Ping An Company, was kidnapped by bandits in front of Yucai School on Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, and later emerged safely in Xujiahui. After the incident, Han Shentang and Xi Ayue were arrested by the Second Precinct of the First District and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which then transferred them to the Local Court for investigation. After the investigation was completed, a public prosecution was filed. Yesterday, Judge Deng opened the court for trial. The defendants all denied the charges. When questioned by the victim Zheng Ruijuan, it was difficult to identify them. The chauffeur Jiang A'er was also summoned to court. The judge ordered six defendants in another case to be lined up for identification, but Jiang also had difficulty identifying them. Then, patrol officer Song Huanzhong testified that he had arrested the two defendants after receiving a report. The judge repeatedly questioned them for a long time. Finally, after the prosecutor finished his arguments and the lawyer made his defense, the judge declared the debate closed and ordered the defendants to await sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Appeal of the Dalun Real Estate Eviction Case Opens</h3>
<p>Both Sides Unwilling to Concede</p>
<p>Yesterday's Debate Concluded</p>
<p>Dalun Real Estate Company, intending to build a nine-story building after leasing a plot of land at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road to Da Zhonghua Department Store, notified seventeen shops, including the Laoda Fang Tea and Food Shop currently operating there, to relocate to facilitate reconstruction. The tenants refused, resulting in a lawsuit. After the preliminary trial in the Provisional Court, the tenants lost the case. Except for two households, the remaining fifteen all refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Hu, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal, along with judges Zhong and Lin, opened the court for a joint hearing. The courtroom was extremely crowded with spectators. First, Judge Hu advised both parties to resolve the matter peacefully to avoid a lengthy lawsuit and inquired about the landlord's willingness to compromise. The lawyer representing Dalun immediately stated that they had originally decided to allow three months of rent so that the defendants could get through the Lunar New Year period. Now, in accordance with the court's intentions, they would again persuade the landlord to extend the grace period by three months. Then, the tenants' claims were heard. According to their lawyer, the buildings were not old and there was no real need for reconstruction. Moreover, the landlord leased the land to Da Zhonghua for an annual rent of 100,000 taels of silver. Now, the tenants were also willing to increase their annual rent from 60,000 taels to 100,000 taels. When the houses were initially rented, the oral agreement was for a term of 20 years. The tenants who had lived there the longest had only been there for eight years. If they were to relocate, regardless of the order of rental, they should all be re-leased for another twelve years. The court also inquired whether the contract with Da Zhonghua stipulated any damages for breach of contract. According to Dalun's lawyer, the contract stipulated that Da Zhonghua would pay an annual ground rent of 100,000 taels of silver, and in addition, compensate Dalun for a portion of the cost of building the house. If the cost was 700,000 to 1,200,000 taels, then Da Zhonghua would have to pay interest of 70,000 to 120,000 taels per year in addition to the ground rent. Even if the contract did not stipulate damages, merchants valued integrity and could not easily breach the contract. Judge Hu also inquired whether the issue of the Hibiya Yoko store's relocation had been resolved. If it had not been resolved, even if the tenants in this case relocated, there would still be shortcomings and a nine-story building could not be constructed. He also lamented that Chinese people raised huge sums of money to start department stores, but mostly sold foreign goods and did not know how to revitalize domestic products. Dalun's lawyer replied that the Hibiya Yoko relocation issue would be negotiated separately after the settlement of this case. The court made all sorts of comparisons, but both sides were unwilling to concede and there was no way to reconcile. They could only proceed with the trial. The hearing continued until dusk and the debate concluded. The court ordered that a date be set for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Working Women's International Banquet</h3>
<p>Evening of the 18th</p>
<p>Working women in Shanghai have long lacked a well-organized organization. Although women from various countries in Shanghai have various independent groups, they have very few opportunities to connect with each other. This time, the YWCA expanded its services and solicited opinions from women of all countries in Shanghai regarding the construction of a new clubhouse, which is the starting point for women of all countries in Shanghai to cooperate. Now, the YWCA will hold a grand banquet for all working women in Shanghai at the American Women's Association address at No. 113 Jing'an Temple Road next Tuesday, February 18th, which is a new milestone in the united women's movement in Shanghai.</p>
<p>It is known that working women in various countries around the world, whether in the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, or Japan, all have a grand annual banquet. Shanghai has never had one before. From now on, Shanghai will not be at a disadvantage in this regard. Moreover, uniting all working women, regardless of national boundaries, to gather and enjoy themselves in one place is the starting point for women from different countries to communicate with each other and is in line with the world trend. It is also heard that the banquet next Tuesday will have "national team" organizations to allow representatives of each country to highlight the characteristics of their country, and there will be various performances from various countries. It will definitely be a grand occasion. This event is managed by a joint committee of Chinese, American, British, German, Japanese, Portuguese, and Russian individuals. The cost per person is 1.6 yuan. Those who wish to participate can purchase tickets at the YWCA at No. 4 Museum Road.</p>
<h3>The YMCA Holds an Integrity Campaign</h3>
<p>Soliciting Signatures Against Dog Racing and Roulette Gambling</p>
<p>The Sichuan Road YMCA will hold a large-scale integrity campaign for three days from the 13th to the 15th of this month to promote virtues such as thrift, diligence, honesty, and savings, in order to cultivate good citizens. The general order is as follows: in addition to the all-day exhibition displaying various pictures and specimens for people to view, famous people will be invited to speak at 5:30 PM every afternoon. The first day will be Mr. Zhao Jinqing's "Integrity Saves the Country," the second day will be Mr. Qian Xinzhi's "The Importance of Savings," and the third day will be Mr. Zhang Zhijiang's "Simple Life." There will be movies and new dramas at 8 PM every night. Admission tickets can be obtained temporarily from the association. Children will not be admitted.</p>
<p>In addition, the Nanshi Puyi Society of the YMCA, the Vocational Education Society of the French Concession, and the Pudong Public Society of Yangshupu, in view of the increasing gambling trend in Shanghai and the severe harm caused by dog racing and roulette gambling, intend to take advantage of the integrity campaign to send letters to the authorities of the British and French Concessions, requesting that they be investigated and banned immediately. The draft of the letter is as follows: "Respectfully, in order to seek social peace and tranquility, it is necessary to eliminate local evils first. The gambling trend in Shanghai has always been rampant. Since the existence of dog racing venues and roulette gambling dens, gamblers in general have become more blatant, and the huge sums of money won and lost day and night are shocking. Young men and women who are addicted to it, losing their fortunes and their personalities, are frequently heard of. Such harm to the community and disaster to society, if not strictly prohibited, would be a disservice to the citizens. Maintaining humanity and rectifying morality are the responsibilities of your bureau. Therefore, in the public interest of the people, we hereby submit this letter to your bureau for review and request that you promptly order the investigation and closure of all dog racing venues and roulette gambling dens within the concession, to eliminate harm to the local area and to show public concern. Those interested in expressing their sympathy from all walks of life can sign their names at the above locations and submit a letter of petition to reverse the declining trend."</p>
<h3>The China Children's Welfare Association Emphasizes Vocational Education for Disaster-Stricken Children</h3>
<p>Chairman Jiang issued instructions to the China Children's Welfare Association, saying, "Today, the ability to educate children lies not only in strengthening their bodies and cultivating their morals, but also in developing their vocational skills for independent livelihood. There are many vagrants in our country today. The reason for this is that most of them did not acquire a vocational skill in their childhood. By the time they reach adulthood, they are unable to farm, unable to do business, and unable to work as laborers. Looking after themselves, they are completely unable to do anything. As a result of their inability to make a living, they are led astray, which is very pitiful. I hope that your association will promote children's vocations and teach them skills so that they can become independent people." Therefore, the association attaches particular importance to children's vocational education and plans to select ten disaster-stricken children to go to the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute in Beiping to learn crafts in order to implement vocational education. It is now learned that the association has selected ten disaster-stricken children who are being fostered in orphanages in Shanghai, who are strong and intelligent, and escorted them to the port yesterday morning at 8 AM by Zhang Junkang, the director of the Longhua Shanghai Orphanage, Mr. Wu Weide, the general secretary of the association, and Mr. Zhang Yueru, the executive secretary, and took the Tangshan Maru to Tianjin, where they transferred to a train to Peiping. It is said that the disaster-stricken children were taken in by the Children's Welfare Association from disaster areas such as Canggou, Teng County, Shandong Province, and have been fostered in orphanages in Shanghai for more than a year. In addition to reading and writing, they also practice woodworking, rattan work, bamboo work, tailoring, and other crafts, working half-time and studying half-time, with considerable success. The association heard that the crafts of the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute are well-organized, so they specially selected ten people to go to study, in order to alleviate the burden of teaching and raising in the Shanghai Orphanage. When in port, Wu, the general secretary of the Children's Welfare Association, delivered a farewell speech, saying, "You have been in Shanghai for more than a year and have been taught and raised by the Shanghai Orphanage, and you have a basic foundation in knowledge. Our association is planning for your future independence and is sending you to the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute in Beiping to learn crafts. We hope that you will work hard and make progress, so as not to let down the good intentions of the association, and to make capital for your future lives. He also said, "You all come from disaster areas and are like brothers in adversity. You should love each other and take care of each other on the way, so that you can go to the Ping Institute safely." It is heard that the ship tickets for the disaster-stricken children were subsidized by Wang Yiting, a famous philanthropist in Shanghai, and that China Travel Service specially sent personnel to Tianjin and Peiping to provide free transportation.</p>
<h3>The Bāxiānqiáo Vegetable Market Relocates for Business</h3>
<p>The Bāxiānqiáo vegetable market in the French Concession has been around for a long time, so the French Public Works Bureau plans to rebuild it into a cement and steel-framed vegetable market to last a long time. It has hired workers to build a simple shed on the open space opposite the Sino-French School on Mintiniyin Road, in preparation for the relocation of the Bāxiānqiáo vegetable market while it is being demolished and rebuilt, so as not to affect business. The electricity has now been installed in the shed. The French Public Works Bureau has also sent personnel to place shelves horizontally in the shed and assign numbers from No. 1 to No. 300 to avoid disputes. Powder lines have also been drawn on the ground to limit the stalls, which must be set up within the powder line boundaries, otherwise they will be fined. According to the vegetable vendors, the French Public Works Bureau has scheduled to build a fence and demolish the Bāxiānqiáo vegetable market on the 17th of this month, so all the stalls will be moved to the shed at the same time. Once the new building of the Bāxiānqiáo vegetable market is completed, they will have to move back.</p>
<h3>Pitiable Woman Marries Her Lover</h3>
<p>Dài Rúzhēn Seeks Freedom After Losing It</p>
<p>Dài Rúzhēn, a woman from Dōngtái, is 21 years old and exceptionally beautiful. Her father, Xiānglín, is a carpenter, and her mother, Wén, is getting older. She was quite favored by her parents when she was young. When she was 17 years old, her father, due to economic difficulties, sold his daughter to a brothel run by Lǐ Bǐng in Rúgāo, receiving 80 silver dollars as her body price. After entering the world of prostitution, Rúzhēn severed ties with her parents. She engaged in the trade of flesh and blood, and her charm attracted many patrons, making her very busy. However, the authorities have recently been strictly banning prostitution, and Lǐ Bǐng has found it difficult to maintain his business. He soon closed down and wanted to resell Rúzhēn. However, Rúzhēn met a clerk named Gù Lánbō in the local Public Security Bureau last year. They fell deeply in love and sowed the seeds of affection. Rúzhēn took the opportunity to elope with Gù and made a golden house in a certain alley in the area. Unexpectedly, their secret was discovered by Lǐ, who went to negotiate. Gù took Rúzhēn to live elsewhere, and Lǐ knew about it but pretended not to hear it. However, Gù wanted to solve the problem once and for all. A week ago, he led Rúzhēn to Shanghai and stayed in a small South Gate inn, living together like husband and wife. Unexpectedly, Rúzhēn's father suddenly missed his daughter and went to Lǐ's place to inquire. He learned that his daughter had eloped with her lover. He suddenly came up with an idea and wanted to take Lǐ to the local Public Security Bureau, ordering Lǐ to hand over his daughter within a time limit. Lǐ was extremely anxious and immediately ordered his friend Hé Sān to take a car to Shanghai to search for her. Yesterday, while passing by the Qiújiāng Road area, he caught sight of Rúzhēn and Gù riding in a rickshaw. He immediately called the local police and arrested them in the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. During the preliminary interrogation by Director Táo, Rúzhēn firmly refused to return to her hometown with Hé and was willing to grow old with Gù. As the case involved enticing her to run away, it was handed over to the judicial section for verification.</p>
<h3>Lǐ Zhàobǐng's Home Robbery Case Involved His Nephew</h3>
<p>Detained for Requesting Photos</p>
<p>Two More Robbers Arrested</p>
<p>Lǐ Zhàobǐng, a Guangdong native, lives at No. 2017 North Sìchuān Road. On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, four robbers broke into his home and stole property worth 1,433 silver dollars. After the incident, Lǐ reported the case to the police station in charge and requested an investigation. The Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to Lǐ's house to investigate and found a photo. According to the victim, it was a portrait of his nephew Lǐ Zhàoquán. Zhàoquán used to work for him but resigned three years ago and had been wandering around. The detective took the photo back to the police station for investigation. On the 10th, Zhàoquán suddenly went to his uncle's house to ask for the photo, but he did not meet Zhàobǐng. Therefore, he went again the day before yesterday and was arrested by the police. He was considered a suspect in the robbery case. Yesterday morning, Judge Tán Xīnzhèn brought him to the Provisional Court for interrogation. Lǐ Zhàobǐng described the robbery. According to Lǐ Zhàoquán, after being dismissed by his uncle, he lived in a certain labor union and worked as a substitute worker. He went to the Guǎngzhēn Building on Fourth Horse Road every day. He heard that his uncle's house had been robbed, so he went to his uncle's place and learned that his photo had been taken away by the police. Therefore, he went to ask for it the day before yesterday and was arrested. The police station stated that the case was still under investigation and requested a postponement. They also said that after the defendant was arrested, they arrested two robbers involved in the case at No. 26 Qiújiāng Road. Because the area belonged to the Chinese territory, the two robbers were detained in the Public Security Bureau and requested that a document be sent to transfer them. Judge Tán ordered Lǐ Zhàoquán to be detained, pending a letter to the Public Security Bureau to transfer the robbers to the case for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Accused of Selling Counterfeit Banknotes</h3>
<p>Zhōu Fùchāng, also known as Wáng Liánshēng, from Ānhuī, colluded with those who manufactured counterfeit banknotes, sold fake tickets, and disrupted the financial system. The Hóngkǒu police station learned of this and ordered detectives to purchase them the day before yesterday. The asking price was 25 yuan per 100 yuan. They purchased 20 fake tickets worth 5 yuan each and arrested Zhōu. The bank also identified them as counterfeit. Afterward, detectives went to Zhōu's residence at No. 1253 Wúsōng Road to search and found 11 fake tickets in an envelope, including 1 yuan and 5 yuan denominations. According to Zhōu, the fake tickets were given to him by Chén Ābǎo in the General Chamber of Commerce on Fourth Horse Road. Chinese and foreign detectives went to investigate and learned that it was Zhōu's false accusation. Zhōu used to work in the General Chamber of Commerce but was punished by the government for stealing items reported by Chén and Fā. Therefore, he wanted to use his old grudges to falsely accuse them. Yesterday morning, Zhōu and the counterfeit banknotes were sent to the Provisional Court. Judge Tán Xīnzhèn brought him to trial. The Chinese and foreign detectives detailed the course of the case and requested a postponement, fearing that the defendant might have committed other cases, so that they could start an investigation. Judge Tán granted the request and ordered the defendant to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested for Night Walking</h3>

They were searched, but nothing was found at first, so they were released. Unexpectedly, they were indeed bandits. When the patrol officers searched them, they took advantage of the dark night to throw away two sharp knives they were carrying. The patrol officers saw the knives on the ground after the four bandits left and immediately chased them, but only three bandits were caught and brought to the Xīnzha Gate Police Station. They confessed their names as Sū Bǎo Hé, Lǔ Āxiáng, and Zhū Xiángshēng. The three bandits also admitted that at 3 AM the day before yesterday, they and Xiàng Āgēn and others robbed Zhào Yúnqīng of a coat and 12 silver dollars at Pàikè Road Jiàngyuán Lane. Xiàng was hiding at No. 173 Tōngshāng Inn on Àiwényì Road. The chief ordered Sergeant Gāo Yànróng to arrest Xiàng. They were sent to the Provisional Court for questioning yesterday.

<h3>Shanghai South Tobacco Industry Announces a General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South Tobacco Industry Association, in order to reorganize its affairs and promote national goods, had originally scheduled a general meeting for yesterday. However, due to incomplete procedures, it has been postponed to the 18th. Yesterday, the association notified its members, stating that member Nan Yongtai and other tobacco shops near the Dadongmen wrote that their Chinese domestic tobacco businesses have been severely impacted by the influx of foreign cigarettes. People prioritize convenience over patriotism, resulting in a massive outflow of money. The lack of unity hinders efforts to remedy the situation. The tobacco shops, being weak, have switched to selling tobacco and sundries. Fortunately, the association has advised them in writing, and the newspapers have encouraged and supported them, helping them stand their ground (omitted section). The influence of the financial crisis has affected all industries, and the tax reform based on gold units has led to a sharp increase in the price of goods. Retail prices have decreased. Maintaining the old sales prices would result in significant losses. The association, together with the other eight member associations, should have senior members participate in the introductions, uniting together to prevent divisions among the members. Future elected officials should also fulfill their obligations and actively proceed. A general meeting will be held at 1 PM on February 18th at the Tobacco Industry Association in Dong Yaojia Lane to thoroughly reorganize business rules, exchange foreign currencies, display price tags, and set uniform prices, as well as discuss the association's fee collection plan. It is crucial that the managing directors of the precious companies attend on time and make decisions. This is hereby notified.</p>

<h3>Orchid Cause Buried with a Boat Girl</h3>
<p>— Yingchuan Furun</p>
<p>The mountains and rivers of Zhejiang are the best in the world. The spiritual beauty is concentrated there, and beautiful women are produced. Boat girl Liu Gehong is a small family's gem. Her ancestors were a prominent clan in Tongjiang, with a reputation for officialdom. However, the girl's father was addicted to gambling, gambling day and night, and the family was ruined. Unable to make a living, he urged his daughter to go north to Fuchun to carry passengers by boat to earn a meager living. The girl's beauty was unparalleled, and her charm was outstanding. Her bright eyes stirred people's emotions with every turn. Those who were quick to lust for her vied for her attention. There was a scholar named Ding from Hulin, a gentle and handsome young man. Last spring, he came to Fu to assist in village administration by order of the Department of Civil Affairs. Because he was not familiar with the place, he went to the ferry to find a boat and met the girl. He was surprised by her celestial beauty, and his soul was given to her. He bowed down before her. When he tried to speak to her, her words and demeanor were like pearls, beautiful and fluent, like a yellow oriole singing out of the valley. They fell in love with each other and regretted meeting so late. From then on, they enjoyed the early spring flowers and the autumn moon. They often shared a small boat, swaying on the Fuchun River, in perfect harmony, envied by the two mandarin ducks sleeping on the sand.</p>
<p>From spring to summer to autumn to winter, the scholar suffered from anemia. He lingered for several months, and the girl worked tirelessly to care for him. But heaven did not bless them. He could not recover from his illness and died one night during a strong wind and bitter rain. The girl also drank a knife beside him that night, becoming a martyr for the sake of their love. Alas. Ding's friends planned to bury them together on the east side of Dongshan and have already contacted both families to finalize this beautiful tale.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Zhongshan Park in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>A guest from Guangzhou talked extensively about the affairs of Guangzhou. Guangzhou is the most prosperous metropolis in the southern part of our country. In recent years, it has strived to modernize its city administration. The roads have been widened, and the streets are clean. It is truly the crown of the Southeast. Guangzhou City has Zhongshan Park, which occupies several acres of land. The layout is very beautiful. Flowers, trees, pavilions, and ponds are all available. It is a great place for citizens to play and relax. The municipal government strives to improve it, using public entertainment venues to promote its policies. Each pavilion in the park is equipped with a sound transmission tube. Wireless broadcasts are aired from one to five in the afternoon. Visitors gather, and all kinds of reports from various speakers, market conditions, celebrity speeches, and famous singers are heard clearly in the valley. Western music is also played occasionally. Foreigners who visit this garden often borrow a patch of greenery.</p>
<h3>Literary Tiger Guessing</h3>
<p>— Wu Lianzhou</p>
<p>Literary tiger. A game for literary people. In recent years, the study of traditional Chinese learning has declined, almost to the point of becoming extinct. Little does one know that the literary tiger can promote the arts, assist in education, and cultivate good leisure habits. I have written dozens of riddles with Sun Yusheng, Cao Qionghan, Shi Jiqun, and Zhang Haiyun. They will be published in this column daily. If you wish to guess, please mail your answers within three days to my medical residence next to the Shen Bao newspaper office on Sanma Road. A small reward is prepared to encourage your refined interest.</p>
<p>This year's Literary Tiger Night 1. Opera name: Green smoke covers the sound of spring... Performer's name: A spring breeze and a new tune... Six-character sentence: Smiling, she asks someone else to adjust her crown... Kun opera name: The winding patterns rotate, with chanting of scriptures... Common saying: The golden bridle horse neighs on the fragrant grassland... Road name: Accumulated snow melts away, revealing the bones of the mountain... Medicine name: Pestle enters Qiantang, in the Yangzi... Character: (Cao Shuheng's excellent work will continue tomorrow)</p>
<p>Holding hands in the ancient Tango dance adds color to the beautiful garden. Although there are many famous gardens in Shanghai, such equipment is not yet heard of. And Guangzhou has uniquely opened the trend first. The guest said it like that. I will bring it up, so that people in Shanghai or something may be a lesson.</p>
<h3>Beauty Drinking Games</h3>
<p>— Dan Dang Sheng</p>
<p>Li's Green Cloud Mountain House faces a stream with a bamboo forest surrounding it. Colleagues gathered there for a winter meeting. They always used elegant songs to accompany the wine. By the sixth meeting, they decided to slightly change the previous practice. Lin Jun Heqing said, "I have an idea, which can be called the Beauty Drinking Game. Write words related to the human body on paper rolls, such as beauty's heart, beauty's eyes, beauty's mouth, etc. Everything on a beauty's body can be written on them, so we can get dozens of rolls. The method of ordering is to draw a roll and see what word is on it. Then, use this word to lead into an idiom and recite it. And let one person sitting in the order to drink serve as the order official. If the idiom contains this word, then count from yourself to the number of the word. That is, the number of people to drink. This is straightforward and does not require an order official. The reason why an order official is needed is that the idiom quoted may only cut the meaning of the word, and does not see the literal meaning, then the order official judges. Who should drink? The judgment must have a reason. If the person who should drink does not accept the judgment, and the reasoning is smoother, the order official cannot yield, then the order official drinks himself. Lin Jun then gave an example to the people sitting with him and said, "For example, if you draw a roll for beauty's eyes, recite it, 'Beautiful eyes look forward,' then the second person drinks. The second person is the order official, and should not refuse. Or recite, 'Want to see the distant horizon,' then the fifth person drinks. This sentence does not cut beauty, but it can be flexible. If the public thinks that it should be strict, then the person who should order for all the sentences quoted must accompany a cup. Or recite, 'How can he endure the autumn waves of that turn when he leaves,' This only cuts the meaning of the word, and does not see the literal meaning, then the order official can judge it and say, 'The word autumn wave is in six or seven, and the sixth and seventh people sitting in the row drink.' And Zhang Xing, who is sitting in the middle, should also drink. It is because of this turn of autumn wave, which is for Zhang Junrui. Only autumn wave is still focused on the word. If you encounter a sentence that is completely written in general, the order official will have a lot of thoughts." So everyone praised him. Immediately, they cut paper to make rolls and took a pen to write. They searched for words for the beauty's body, even the intestines, stomach, lungs, and liver, where they could not be seen. Also written into the rolls. There are even some obscene ones, and nothing is left out. Breaking three characters into four characters, such as fingernails and body hair, etc., is meticulous. After writing, there are forty-two rolls. Once the order is carried out, beautiful thoughts, beautiful words, jade crumbs, and clear words, laughter, and confusion, and exchanges are crossed, it can be said that the joy of drinking is exhausted. The following is a record of the order official's judgment that is more interesting. Yang Jun Weiruru drew beauty's tears. Because he recited, "Falling to the autumn steps, sea begonias grow." The order official Li Haichou said, "Weiruru and I were classmates in childhood. Knowing his nickname is Qiu Tang, he should drink two cups." Weiruru said, "I intended to shoot you with the word sea, but I am punishing myself." Haichou said, "I can have one cup, and you should double it." Zhang Jun Zhonghua drew a beauty's arm. He recited, "Who can dispel the jade bend on the pillow." I was the order official and said, "Wang Jun Zhuoru drinks." Asked why, he said, "You initiated the Winter Cooling Society. The jade quality is cold and cold. You are the master of the Winter Cooling Society, and colleagues should let you enjoy this beautiful blessing." Li Jun Haichou drew a beauty's hand. He recited, "I iron my fingers for my husband." The order official said, "Please ask Zhuoru to drink again." Asked why, he said, "This is also the beauty that the master of the Winter Cooling Society enjoys alone." And this sentence is Wang Cihui's poem. You are surnamed Wang. There is also a relationship. Because your drinking capacity is not large, otherwise, you should offer two cups." I drew a beauty's private. Searching for a long time, it was difficult to get it immediately. First of all, Wang Jun Yunsheng had already drawn this and recited the sentence "No one speaks privately at midnight." Although the word "private" is clearly embedded, it is not precise. The order official said that in addition to the fifth person drinking, he ruled that the person sitting side by side on the left should drink. It is said that he had watched the Palace of Eternal Life.</p>
<p>Red Felt</p>
<h3>Xun Huisheng Discusses Drama</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>I wrote a previous discussion on Huisheng's performance of the play "Thirteenth Sister". The opening performance was crowded. Watching the entire play, it was tightly connected and the performance was full of highlights. The postures and movements up and down the stage all contained chivalry in their charm. There were several fast-paced and original-paced segments of singing. The intonation was also clear, stable, gentle, and harmonious. It had been performed before at the Yuelaidian in Hongliucun and Nengren Temple. This time, the redundant scenes were removed, while the key points were retained. For example, the section of returning to the store from Yuelaidian has now been deleted, because the passage of the donkey driver has no particular meaning. The recitations were clear, word by word. Saving Zhang An and his wife and accomplishing a good deed can overwhelm his peers in terms of vividness. Changing into plain clothes to keep vigil further revealed his eagerness for revenge between his eyebrows. It was not until he met Zhang Jinfeng, who proposed marriage, that he realized there was an opportunity to fulfill a beautiful dream together. He was extremely wonderful when embarrassed by Zhang. The final scene of capturing the thief, although a small wave, also concluded the entire play. The story of this play is found in the novels, with Furong Cao and Zhang Jinfeng. The Zhuzhu all called the father and son of Chunyan Zhongren's family. The wife of the Fulu monk, her every move and speech, made people recognize her as handsome. Cao Mao, Bao Deng Jiu Gong, was also very diligent.</p>
<p>The play "Du Shiniang Angrily Sinks the Treasure Chest" had almost become a play that no one in the southern female roles did not perform in the past. Among the average actors, there has not yet been a performance. Huisheng and the famous playwright Mr. Chen Moxiang revised this book, adding singing lyrics. The melody is elegant and acceptable. The singing style is also different from others. Su San Yaxian... the performance has already gained public praise. Ten Niang must be able to do the same.</p>
<p>People only know that Huisheng is best at playing Huadan, but they don't know that she can perform tragic and mournful plays. In Ping, there are two plays written: "Yuzaogong, Queen Lu Jealousy Slaying Consort Qi," and "Lu Fangweng's Xiu Zi's Hairpin Phoenix". Every time they are performed, no one in the audience can help but shed tears due to emotional impact. The script is perfect and beneficial to the world.</p>
<h3>On Xu Biyun</h3>
<p>— Hao</p>
<p>Generally, to become a famous actor, one must have the basic advantages that make them famous. I usually don't like watching plays, but I especially like listening to the radio. During my rest, I occasionally use this as a pastime. I find that the records of Qingyi are the most pleasant to listen to, because they are quiet, delicate, and graceful. And Xu Biyun's "Baolian Lantern", "Imperial Stele Pavilion", "Yutang Chun", and other plays are especially clear and fluent. From this, I know that her fame cannot be achieved by luck. Biyun is an outstanding talent from Binqing Society. She has come to Shanghai several times, and her reputation is comparable to that of the Four Vajras. I occasionally go to listen to her plays. I feel that her voice has reached the point of perfection, and her expressions and recitations are especially like Mei Lanfang. I know that she is deeply influenced by him. In the future, she will follow Wanhua and rise, and she is the one. Biyun's masterpiece "Yutang Chun" has been sold out many times. There are also dramas such as "The Pearl Dream" and "Farewell to Green Pearl," which will be performed in sequence. There should be another grand occasion.</p>
<p>The secret oath of the Qixi Festival, Tang Minghuang was always on the left side of the noble concubine. I thought about it for a while, and then said, "I have a saying from the emperor." Everyone asked what it was. I said, "Woman is a tool." Someone said, "Is this also a jieduling?" I said, "Yes. The character 'Ru' is often written as the character 'Nu' in ancient books." Someone asked, "Are all organs called tools? I'm afraid it's difficult to pinpoint the character for 'private.'" I smiled. The order official Wang Jun said, "The word 'also' is written as 'female yin' in the Shuowen Jiezi. This sentence can be said to be extremely precise." Then he pointed at Yu Jun and said, "You should drink. What tool is asked below? It's a coral." There is a character 'coral' in your name, so you should drink." I remember that Suiyuan's poetry says that you need to use a beauty soldier for winter cooling. Such a drinking order can also be called a winter cooling story.</p>
<h3>Record of a Banquet at the Small Bottle Flower Studio</h3>
<p>— Yan Xiaxiang Ke</p>
<p>The day after the Lantern Festival was clear, and the spring was still cold. The owner of the Small Bottle Flower Studio hosted a banquet, and the guests were all noble and refined companions, hiding their tracks by the sea, each supporting themselves with their writings, paintings, and calligraphy, without making money in the mundane world. Halfway through the wine, the host took out his collection of famous paintings, screens, hand scrolls, fan albums, and other things from ancient and modern times, one by one. Mr. Tang Dongfu has not been selling paintings for long, and I didn't know him. On this day, I saw one of his four-foot scrolls and two of his paintings on fans. I felt that his intentions were lofty and far-reaching, and his brushstrokes were deep and elegant. He was able to combine the styles of Shi Tian, ​​Mo Jing, and Lianzhou. I asked the owner, and I learned that Mr. Tang was a direct descendant of Tang Zhenmin, General Yusheng. It is appropriate that his family has a long history of learning and is far from ordinary. He can be compared with Mr. Gu Wu and others in recent days. I heard that Mr. Tang is humble and upright. He neither follows the crowd nor creates differences. Outside of painting, he is also fond of cups and handles. I am also a drunkard. Although I know a little about painting, I dare not get involved. The owner loves painting but refuses to paint himself. His collection is extremely rich, and his appraisal is especially precise. Now that I have seen Mr. Tang's paintings for the first time, and they have been obtained by the owner, I am even more impressed by his ability to have a discerning eye. So I raised a large white cup to congratulate the owner and retreated to write a record for him and Mr. Tang, and made friends with them. (Pay back)</p>

However, observing the trading scene, supply exceeded demand, leading to a slight decrease in prices. As for the future of silver discounts, they remained as loose as before, so there was no market trend worth noting.</p>

<h3>The Enigmatic Gold Market</h3>
<p>Fluctuations are Unpredictable, and People are Uneasy: Yesterday, the twelfth, the gold market situation changed from strong to weak, with constant ups and downs, making it difficult to determine the trend. It seemed to be forming a revolving situation. There were several taels of price differences in the previous market, and trading among colleagues was frequent. However, selling was stronger than buying. Yuan Mao Yong, Tai Xing, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yu Da, and others all sold, while the buyers were Fu Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Bing Xing, Wan Xing, Shun Li, and others. As for remittances, they were tight in the morning and loose in the afternoon. Most firms seemed to be selling off, and market sentiment remained uncertain. Since the large-scale shrinking in the early market, it rose by about two taels, reaching the 490 tael mark. Subsequently, sellers became active, and it immediately declined by three to four taels. However, the Guangdong group and others continued to enter, and remittances became slightly stronger. It has now recovered by two taels. However, due to large accounts selling off, remittances turned weak. Banks depreciated and purchased. For example, Japanese gold only recovered one tael and one fen and two five, and suddenly plummeted, falling by three taels and breaking into the 86 tael range. At the afternoon closing, Heng Xing re-entered, suddenly raising the price by over one tael. The market was stable afterwards, with only one tael fluctuation. Due to Wednesday, the foreign exchange market was inactive. Only Zhi Feng Yong and others bought in, so the final increase was between 88 taels. The recent price of British silver bars has decreased by one-eighth, and the forward price has decreased by one-sixteenth. The price of silver has decreased by three-eighths. The British-Japanese and Japanese-American prices remained the same.</p>
<p>Turned Downstream Immediately After Opening High: The March gold standard opened high, increasing by nine qian, to 490 taels. The gross spread fell from 90 taels, 01 qian to 86 taels, 45 qian, due to Yu Da and others entering and then exiting. Moreover, remittances also declined. In the initial transactions between British gold and banks in March and April, they did eleven pence, eight one two five. After that, China Belgium bought in eleven pence, nine three seven five. The shilling was quoted as remaining unchanged. The price dropped from 87 taels, 2 qian to 6 taels, 9 qian. Suddenly, buyers became enthusiastic, and the appetites of MacKay, East Asia, Mitsui, and others for British gold were still good. The same price in March and April was eleven pence, nine three seven five. They then bought in eleven pence, eight seven five. Japanese gold was bought by Mitsui and others for one tael, one fen, six two five to seven five. The gold price then rose by one or two taels, reaching 88 taels, 7 qian at 10:30. Afterwards, large accounts such as Tai Xing sold off one after another, and the banks' sentiments softened accordingly. Therefore, remittances also turned weak and sluggish. In March, China Italy and Mitsui bought British gold for eleven pence, nine three seven five, but afterwards it was difficult to close the deal, and it returned two shillings. Japanese gold could be settled at one tael, one fen, three seven five. As a result, the gold price suddenly weakened, falling by more than three taels, reaching 85 taels, 5 qian at 11:30. Afterwards, China Belgium bought US dollars for 48 yuan, 5, and bought British gold for eleven pence, eight seven five for the current month. It immediately rose by more than one tael, to 87 taels, 1 qian. The closing price in the afternoon was 86 taels, 7 qian.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Inactive, Afternoon Usually Calm: The after-market opened at 87 taels, 5 qian. Because the volume of goods opened was already large, it then rose to 88 taels, 2 qian. Only scattered accounts sold off, so it immediately decreased by a little more than one tael, reaching 87 taels, 2-3 qian at 3:00. Zhi Feng Yong then began to sell and enter, but the supply on the table was not smooth, and market sentiment was high, so it gradually increased by about two taels. The closing price at 4:30 was 488 taels, 1 qian, which has recovered compared to the 11th. However, due to Wednesday, there was no market. The China Belgium closing price was higher by eleven taels. The highest price of the day was 90 taels, 01 qian, and the lowest price was 85 taels and a half, with a fluctuation of 4 taels and 6 qian. The quoted price was still 498 taels, 6 qian because the quoted price of Japanese gold was not changed. Since the morning, it was a small eleven taels. It decreased by twelve taels at noon, with the registration price at 88 taels to 87 taels, and the additional water was 88 taels. The additional water in the after-market was 89 taels. The quoted price still decreased by a pattern of eleven taels. The goods opened at 89 taels and a half in the morning, the noon closing was 6 taels and 8 qian, the afternoon was 7 taels and 6 qian, and the closing price was 8 taels and 6 qian.</p>

Yu Da initially entered and then exited. Heng Xing exited and then re-entered. Yuan Heng, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yuan Tai, etc., all bought in. The Dalian group covered slightly, totaling about 1,600 bars, and also sold about 800 bars. Yuan Mao Yong sold over 3,000 bars on behalf of customers. Trading among colleagues in the afternoon was not as intense as in the morning. Only Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Chang, Yuan Tai, etc., bought in, while sellers included Tai Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, Yong Cheng Chang, Wan Xing, etc.</p>

According to overseas telegraphic communication, the Indian exchange rate decreased slightly by 0625, to 47 rupees, 3125. Yokohama rose slightly, and Kobe was mediocre, with no changes. The local exchange rates in this city were tight in the early morning, but then became loose due to the weakening of the gold standard. The supply of gold exceeded demand, and market sentiment was low again, forming a revolving situation that was confusing. At noon, the resulting price of each exchange rate, compared to the previous day, showed that the shilling rose slightly by 0625, the US dollar rose by 125, and the Japanese gold fell by 3125. Because it was Wednesday, there was no official market in the afternoon, but there was no news of underground trading.

Banks such as China Belgium, Mitsui, MacKay, East Asia, and Sumitomo all bought in, but only a few sold off.

<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Fall by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>Trading was Very Active, Reaching Over 5.3 Million Yuan: Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market's spot government bonds were very quiet, with only a continuous roll-over of 1,000 yuan. The futures market situation became increasingly tense. Rumors about the situation were rampant, and people were anxious, making buying and selling even more active. The turnover between the two markets reached over 5.3 million yuan, of which customs duties were the most active, accounting for over 1.4 million yuan. Among them, March futures accounted for about 1 million yuan.

With no market for finance, the sellers in the market became more active due to the rampant rumors about the situation. Customs duties, continuous roll-overs, and other bonds dropped significantly as soon as they opened in the morning, and then continued to fall step by step, with no sign of weakening. If large accounts had not covered, the price decline might have been even greater. As a result, customs duties and continuous roll-overs for the current and next month, Zheng Liu, and Seven-Year Bonds for the current month all fell by more than one yuan, while others fell by about half a yuan. Only Jiu Liu remained stable, with very little change.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Trading Show Slight Turnaround</h3>
<p>American Cotton Telegrams Continue to Strengthen - Current Demand is Also Said to be Good</p>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening, and the trend is hardening. Sellers are shorting because the yarn inventory of various factories is quite large. However, some are concerned that once the various groups start actively purchasing during the spring season, they are not selling as much as possible at a price of 55-56 taels, but the overall trend is still weakening. Current yarn sales are still said to be good.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Recovers Two Dollars - In the previous market, American cotton recovered for three days, causing retail investors to cover their positions. The trading floor was relatively calm.

<h3>Cotton Market Follows Foreign Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firmer. Because American cotton has risen for three consecutive days, the situation is stable. Therefore, those shorting in the Chinese market have decreased, and retail investors have also rushed to cover their positions. However, because Japanese merchants have purchased too much Indian cotton from various factories, their sentiment is flat. They are selling in the cotton futures market anyway. Because of the high land prices, the Chinese groups continue to purchase. The cotton market seems to be advancing or retreating according to foreign cotton.</p>
<p>Near-Term Returns by Five Dollars - The cotton futures market opened, and the market sentiment was established because long-term cotton was stable. There were very few sellers. Each month rose by five fen to one qian and a half. In the afternoon, the market sentiment improved because the yarn market was firm and retail investors were covering their positions. Each month rose by five fen to one qian. The total daily turnover was 30,000 dan. The closing price of the Chinese market is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot Demand is Weak - Spot cotton business is relatively quiet. The total supply at the dock is 100 bales of Tonghua and 400 bales of Yaohua.

<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>American Cotton Short Covering Rallies - Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to poor news from Liverpool, but then it strengthened due to reactive buying and short covering. The futures price rose by 14-17 pounds. The spot price rose by 15 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 2 points. The spot price rose by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 20 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but then softened due to local short sellers dumping. The Pingguoer near-term and long-term prices fell by one rupee. The Omra near-term and long-term prices were unchanged. The Bairoxi price rose by two rupees, and the long-term price rose by one rupee.

<h3>Grain and River-Bottom Rice Market Varies Between Firm and Weak</h3>
<p>Zhabei - Yesterday, the number of arriving boats on various routes was slightly strong, totaling more than 20. Market sales were still sluggish. The price of North Japonica rice was slightly weaker by half a jiao. If customers urgently selling goods, they had to reduce the price by two jiao. While for high-quality goods, customers intended to wait for the market to rise, so only slightly softened. The arrival and sales of thin rice were scarce, and the overall situation was stable. Demand for sheep glutinous rice was still weak, and sales were not smooth. However, the supply was also scarce, so they barely maintained the original price. The demand for Du glutinous rice was gradually strong, but customer wharves' glutinous rice showed the opposite, showing dullness. Although various prices were announced to be stable, the situation was quite sparse, because the shops in this street were all ordering foreign rice, which affected this glutinous rice. Yuan transactions were quiet, and the price was close to a jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai - Not many goods arrived at the river bottom, and sales were quite active. The price of Changzhou and Xixi machine-processed japonica rice tightened by one jiao, because the goods were scarce. There were sporadic transactions of Suzhou and Tongbai japonica rice from rural villages, so they were raised by about half a jiao. But inferior goods did not rise. The situation of thin early rice in the Southern gang was the flattest. The sales market in this street was extremely small, and customers did not want to sell urgently, so the market was neither prosperous nor weak. Customer sales of sheep Du glutinous rice turned strong, because the ports of Zhejiang and Shaoxing had a shortage of goods and prices were high, so they came to Shanghai to purchase, and the market situation became tight. The demand for Yuan coins moved slightly, but the market price was not easy to prosper, because the inventory was quite thick. The market situation in various shops here was firmer than in North Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Domestic Customers Actively Purchase Term Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to be purchased by domestic customers, and the supply on the market was scarce. The market price and sentiment rose together. The spot price was good by another five fen, and the futures price also rose by four to five fen. The market was increasingly lively. The overall market only opened with about 1,000 bales of Saigon No. 1 spot rice, with a price of 14 yuan and 3 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. No. 2 goods were out of stock and not opened. However, domestic customers' intention to purchase was very good. Because spot rice was lacking, they all switched to purchasing futures, so the futures market could rise in the same shape as spot rice. Overall market turnover was 500 bales of Saigon rice for delivery in two to three days, with a price of 14 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. Also, 1,000 bales for April delivery, with a price of 6 taels, 2 qian, and 3 fen; 1,000 bales of small squeezed rice for delivery in 7 days, with a price of 13 yuan and 2 jiao; 4,000 bales for delivery this month, with a price of 13 yuan; 1,000 bales for February delivery, with a price of 6 taels and 05 fen; Also, 7,000 bales for March delivery, with a price of 6 taels and 03 fen; 7,000 bales of large squeezed rice for March delivery, with a price of 5 taels and 9 qian; 7,000 bales of Mindang rice for March delivery, with a price of 6 taels and 4 qian and a half.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Follows Tianjin Telegram and Returns Small in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the prices of the various months of the flour futures market continued to rise, with the near and far prices rising by about half a fen. Because sentiment wanted to be bullish, and the telegram news of foreign wheat also rose, the market became more prosperous. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, there was a sudden report that the spot flour in Tianjin was one fen lower, selling for 3 yuan and 7 jiao. Many scattered customers immediately returned to sell, and the near-term price immediately weakened. The far-term price also followed slightly, and there was no major difference in the actual sales of customer groups, so the market situation turned stable. The closing price for March was slightly lower by 2 li and a half, February was unchanged, and the far-term prices were better: April and July were both large by 25, and May was large by 5 li, and June was large by</p>
<h3>South and North Goods Dried Longan Industry Wildly Raises Market Price</h3>
<p>Arising from Sample Deduction Dispute</p>
<p>The dried longan industry's spring market opening has not yet commenced due to new demands for 98% or 99% sample deductions. However, various firms believe this demand greatly affects the owners of the goods and must seek agreement from peers and owners before responding and deciding on a method. Thus, the trade association is impatient, using the refusal to open trading as leverage, and is wildly raising market prices at other firms. For example, top-grade large round longans, selected by experts, of superior yellow color, were only selling for thirty-one or thirty-two taels. However, yesterday, the original customer goods were raised to thirty-four taels, leading to inverted costs and unstable market conditions. However, through this rise, the market trend has indeed tightened, and it may turn false into reality and become a normal market; one cannot say for sure.</p>
<h3>Prediction of Red Plate for Oil Market Hankow Oil</h3>
<p>The red plate for Hankou oil is the latest. In the past, the opening of the market in the second month of the lunar calendar was common. In the last ten years, the market has opened after the Lantern Festival. The reason is that the number of borrowed loading facilities has gradually decreased year by year, and market fluctuations are uncertain, so it is better to open early to set the price of borrowed oil. Now that the Lantern Festival is near, the red plate is said to be under discussion. According to news, it will be announced within two or three days. It is said that it will be roughly the same as the end of the year. Ren Zhongjing is predicted to be thirteen taels and two mace, San Heng thirteen taels and eight mace, miscellaneous heavy twelve taels, Ping Jing twelve taels and four or five mace, Tianjin city twelve taels two or three mace to twelve taels. However, Macheng oil must be twelve taels and eight mace, which seems better, because a few foreign firms have handled it. The estimated gross village goods are thirteen taels. Although the number is not large, it does not lack embellishment on the market. Although this is a predicted plate, it will not deviate too much. According to detailed letters, the red plate opening price in Jinhua and Lanxi and other places is plus one. Duzhu alone is sixteen yuan and eight jiao, Ming Jian sixteen yuan and four jiao, Zhengan sixteen yuan, and De Gan fifteen yuan and eight jiao, which seems to be an improvement over last year. However, it is also the scene that the red plate should have. A letter from Hangzhou dealers reports that the inner ping oil is twenty-one yuan and four jiao, and various banks sent friends to Shanghai to sell for twenty yuan and eight jiao, which shows that the reported price and the selling price are inconsistent, and the difference between visiting customers and selling goods. There have been no customers for the local car oil in Jiaxing, but it is said that the inland selling price is twenty-one yuan and four or five jiao per car, while sending to Shanghai is still between twenty-one yuan and seven or eight jiao.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Chinese Silk Must Have Inspection Certificate to be Exported</h3>
<p>Implemented on March 1... The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs for verification. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to develop the European sales of Chinese silk, specifically ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to establish a raw silk inspection office, which will be implemented on March 1. After that, regardless of whether the factory white, yellow, or gray silk is transported to European and American countries, an inspection certificate issued by the raw silk inspection office must be presented before the customs will allow it to pass. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs to verify and implement it.</p>
<h3>Yellow and White Factory Silk Goods are Scarce and Prices are Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' silk market showed even greater prosperity. The European and American markets need raw silk due to spring goods, and the Shanghai port frequently sends telegrams to transfer to Shanghai. Due to the scarcity of raw materials and insufficient remaining goods, the market atmosphere is even firmer for Chinese silk merchants. Yesterday, ten packages of Shanghai white factory silk were imported by the public security, etc. The price of silk was firm and popular.</p>

<p>German Ringworm Lotion New Goods Have Arrived The Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road announced that the department has been managing the famous German skin sacred medicine ringworm lotion for many years, and the sales are extremely strong.

Now a large number of new ringworm lotions have been transported from the head office and are sold as usual, so there is no need to worry about a break in supply. The price is still two and a half yuan per bottle and two yuan and a half per dozen, and it will not increase due to the high exchange rate.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Self-Built Houses</h3>
<p>The China Business Company announced yesterday an article on the benefits of self-built houses, the original text is as follows,</p>
<p>In society, only those who own their own houses make the greatest contribution to the development of society, the welfare of the people, and the art of architecture, etc., and landlords who widely own real estate and collect rent are far inferior. Those who own their own houses are willing to increase equipment and improve layout for the houses, because they know deeply that once the houses are added and improved, their value will inevitably increase sharply. Moreover, after a family adds and renovates its own houses, its neighbors</p>

<p>Audian Screens Leisen, the Thief The Audian Theater announced that "Leisen, the Thief," a European giant film, is an unprecedented masterpiece in the world of film in 1928, and has been selected as the champion, standing far opposite the American production of "The Patriot."

The talented director Toronsky used this masterpiece to become this precious giant film, which is magnificent and gorgeous, and passionately exciting. It narrates the revolution of the lower classes through the life of pirates. The emotions are tense and the thoughts are full. There is really a lot to be done.</p>
<h3>University Teacher Receives Anonymous Letter (Jianying)</h3>
<p>"Oh... Your wife ran away... The words are written in white letters." Those who live in their own houses will also add some decorations to enhance the appearance and avoid being ridiculed for being inferior. However, large landlords are not like this. In their minds, they only pursue the lowest cost and the highest income.</p>
<p>In the past, residential areas in Shanghai were all limited to the public concession. After tenants rented a house, they often installed their own bathtubs, washbasins, kitchen utensils, gas pipes, electric lights, etc. When moving, they would dismantle and take away these decorations, which caused great losses to themselves, and the houses were damaged by excavation, and the cost of redecoration by the new tenants was not available. Moreover, in the past, if you wanted to get hot water, you could either get it from the kitchen, or cook it yourself in a large pot, or get it from the so-called tiger stove nearby. How could there be the convenience of today's hot and cold water pipes? In the past, landlords never asked about the improvement and decoration of houses, etc., and tenants were not willing to spend a lot of money on properties that did not belong to them, except for the necessities.</p>
<p>This company was founded in 1909 and has been in business for more than 20 years. It is one of the earliest real estate companies in the port. The development of its business has been seen in the advertising columns of Shenbao.</p>

<p>This company has made great contributions to the various improvements and advantages of today's new and beautiful residences in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The goal of this company is to improve the living conditions in Shanghai and encourage tenants to become owners of their own houses. This company has chosen undeveloped plots with careful eyes and clear foresight, and has obtained the cooperation of the authorities, and has engaged in opening up roads, dividing land, and building various beautiful houses with different styles on it, which has revolutionized the rough brick house atmosphere of the past. The houses built by the China Business Company have different styles, and the most modern decorations in the room, the family members who live in it, are especially admired. Such as sanitary equipment, such as kitchen bathrooms, etc., all four walls are paved with magnetic tiles, large magnetic basins, bathtubs, hot and cold water pipes, gas pipes, electric pipes, flushing toilets, etc., everything is available and strives for excellence.</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, there was a large square of farmland between Da Hualong Road, Jin Shenfu Road, Lafayette Road, and the French Park, and its price was only between 1,000 and 1,500 taels per mu. This company saw this and purchased the land from various small owners, and the plan was immediately started. The French Concession Public Works Bureau knew that the company's plan was of great benefit to the concession and did its best to help, such as gas, tap water, electricity, and other utilities, all of which have been deeply cooperated, especially the widening of roads and the planting of trees on sidewalks.</p>
<p>The company's plan has been very effective. However, the company does not take the land as its own for profit, but divides the land into several small squares and sells it for 2,000 taels per mu.</p>
<p>Some of the houses are sold for cash after they are built. It is also possible to mortgage loans or pay monthly payments in lieu of rent without cash. Moreover, if the residents are dissatisfied with this type of house, the company can also advance funds to build a new house to their liking. The conditions for selling houses can not only encourage savings, but also force frugality, which is one of the most beneficial investments.</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, this section is not the most superior residential area, but also one of the most superior residential areas. There is no vacant land in it, and all homeowners are owners of their own houses. The value of this land is estimated at about 15,000 taels per mu at the current land price, and the houses can be sold for 40,000 to 60,000 taels per house.</p>
<p>All those who purchase real estate according to this company's method not only live in extreme comfort, but also save and become rich, or sell and obtain huge profits.</p>
<p>The Chinese people today need housing improvement. However, before today, the Chinese middle class really had no opportunity to buy Chinese-style houses. Therefore, the houses they lived in were all purchased by large landlords, and large landlords only looked at profit. The more buildings, the greater the income, the lighter the construction cost, and the greater the profit. Therefore, those who live in these houses can hardly be called a family, and can only be called a place to shelter from the wind and rain. Moreover, the rent is extremely high. An ordinary property only has a general deed.</p>
<p>The China Business Company firmly believes that the Chinese people, especially women, all want their own houses, which can be occupied exclusively for themselves and can be arbitrarily added, modified, or decorated. This company has seen this and wants to make a test to prove this ideal, so it is engaged in building a large section of Chinese-style houses again. Each house is equipped with various modern devices, and the rest is divided into several squares, each square has a separate deed. Once the houses there are built, they can be sold, or purchased with cash, or other conditions can be agreed, all of which are possible.</p>
<p>All those who purchase real estate, whose plans and policies are adapted to the needs of society, also help the development of that society the most. Therefore, one hundred small owners are more beneficial to society than one large owner.</p>
<p>This company also has a so-called real estate mortgage mutual benefit bond, that is, small savers can enjoy the same preferential interest as large savers. The company accepts savings of 10 taels or 10 yuan or more, and pays interest at 7%, which is paid twice every six months. This type of savings is invested by the company in mortgages of the best real estate, and is specifically used to guarantee this type of bond separately. In addition, the company uses the company's entire assets as collateral. The company has established a special department to manage this matter separately. 25% of the interest on this type of bond is used as a dividend, so the annual interest on holding this type of bond is always at 8% or more, which was the case for the past four years.</p>
<p>The most reliable and most effective business is the real estate trust company, and its financial position in real estate is like a bank in commerce. All societies, regardless of size, in which companies with real estate as their business, are based on the number of their people and the amount of real estate investment.</p>
<p>The real estate investment in Shanghai is unknown how many tens of millions, but the people of Shanghai still do not have a publicly recognized place where they can borrow cash with reliable collateral (real estate title deeds), and real estate sales can be completed quickly. New buyers can thus obtain information on various needs for consideration, and sellers can know the current value of their real estate at any time and compare it with the value of real estate around them. They can obtain economic assistance, so that construction can be well improved, and mortgage savings and other items can be quickly found to eliminate the delays of various large real estate companies in demanding guarantees and insurance.</p>
<p>The China Business Company is planning to issue all of its 1.5 million taels of unissued shares, increasing the share capital to 2 million taels. Then, it will engage in organizing a large-scale real estate trust company. Since its establishment, this company has been in business for more than 20 years, and its management personnel and business policies have not changed from beginning to end. Therefore, all those who have transactions with this company, whether Chinese or foreign, have expressed satisfaction, and this company has been able to carefully study the real estate business in Shanghai and make the business progress day by day. The mortgage loans handled by this company have reached no less than 45 million taels of principal and interest, all of which have been fully paid off, which is clear evidence. The location of the China Business Company is in the center of Shanghai's business and also the gathering point of Shanghai's real estate business. There are more than 90 Chinese and foreign employees, and it manages more than 5,000 houses. There are as many as 800 people involved in the trust of Chinese real estate. The greatness of the company's productivity, the breadth of its vision, and the effectiveness of its management can be seen in its announced business situation.</p>
