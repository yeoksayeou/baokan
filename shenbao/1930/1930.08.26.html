<p>時評</p>
<h3>第二國際議會聲援印度自治</h3>
<p>第二國際議會之執行委員會此次開會時關於印度問題之議案除英代表不投票外全塲一致皆贊成印度之自治由此可知印度人之要求自治不特印度以爲當然即各國之人亦無一以爲不當然者其反對之者惟英人耳由此又可知英人之對於印度非特抱帝國主義者不願其自治即社會主義之代表亦以英國之故不肯投票是其愛主義之心不敵其愛國之心深又可於是見之矣</p>
<p>夫世界之人事禪遞而不息者不外二端一則準之以理一則順之以勢凡各民族無一不當獨立而自治要求自治理之無可非議者也况自歐戰以後之潮流以前被壓迫之民族得解放而獨立自治者已不知凡幾何獨於印度而不許是印度人之要求獨立自治又勢之所不可抗也旣當於理而又合於勢故各國之人皆贊成之英國今雖尙在盡力抵抗而其結果必不能不如印度人之願者亦以人事禪遞之原則除理與勢外更無其他之力可用也</p>

<p>領海線侵漁之調查</p>
<p>農礦部前曾咨行沿海遼寗河北山東江蘇浙江福建廣東七省調查日本漁船在我國領海範圍内侵漁事實詳細具報現除廣東福建浙江三省外均已詳細查覆特錄如下</p>
<p>遼寗六月十三日有日本汽船十三隻在新民區一帶海面越界捕魚由錦縣局長王靜率綏遼飛龍兩砲艦追獲日捕魚船大東丸一艘七月十九日佐籐氏以石油發動機漁船在莊河海面楊家大圈南越捕魚當被查獲均令其具永不侵漁切結釋放其他秘密侵漁日船無從證實者尙不計其數</p>
<p>河北六月間有日本電綱船在臨榆越境捕魚掛損漁戶計關雲等漁鈎十餘筐損失甚鉅此外日本漁船被東北海面驅逐潛往河北海面侵漁者更時有所聞嗣經省方設法制止日本漁船始不復來至該省沿海其他各縣海面時被日漁船侵漁者尙無從查考</p>
<p>江蘇日本漁輪每年四月中（約廢曆三月初間）常有二十餘艘在嵊山東北海礁之西北捕捉米魚率以爲常至去年十月中旬日本拖網漁船八五號博多丸等有十七八艘在花鳥山東北水深三十尋至三十七八尋之區縱横馳駛以致魚類頓形减少滬埠各輪均受莫大影響不得已引向佘山東南鳥山西北採捕日輪竟隨之而來毫無忌憚</p>

<h3>米業領袖</h3>

<p>平價趨勢可望趨跌</p>
<p>特區平米處即開辦</p>
<p>本市米價日趨鬆跌新聲社記者以糧食問題關於平民生計至鉅昨特往訪米業領袖陸文龍詢以米價將來之趨勢承陸君詳告一切並及特區平米處即將舉辦情形茲分錄其談話如下</p>
<h3>抑平米價經過　在一個月前本</h3>
<p>埠米價日就飛漲非特粒食平民有不能舉炊之憂即普通商店工廠亦感受影響其時本市社會局及各團體雖經種種設法先之以調查繼之以限價然所得結果仍無大効最後用集中支配方法即就本市米船停泊之南市閘北兩處將每日到米統行彚計交由米號同業公會負責分别支配於各米號藉免米客抬價操縱之弊使米價無論如何不得再繼漲增高同時本人（陸君自稱）於米號同業詳加調查向社會局保證一個月内滬市决無糧食恐慌危險一面再設法訂購洋米以爲救濟此過去抑平米價經過之大概也</p>
<h3>本年各處豐收　米價僅特洋米進</h3>
<p>口救濟自非根本解决辦法即以本市而論洋米進口代價當在一萬萬元以上如許金錢拱手與人寗不痛心故根本救濟必須使國内豐收本年各産米省區年成極佳大概湖南江西兩省之米均有十二分收成浦東産米比較往歲竟能增加至十分之四故浦東米當新穀上塲時開價爲二十一元現已跌至十八元又安徽與南京交界之處爲秈米出産區域亦告有年米價自十六元跌至十四元總之就目前情形而論果有一個月内無大風及久雨之天災則本年年成非特有十二分且將有十四分米價趨跌可預言也</p>
<h3>舉辦平米情形　本市米價平跌</h3>
<p>根本上固因新米豐收之故而當局及社會熱心人士舉辦平米之努力亦實爲重要原因之一查平米發售處已經舉辦者已有十處最近虞洽卿先生更擬籌欵五十萬元舉辦平米十萬担每担準備虧耗五元至進行計畫由財政部撥二十五萬元由市政府工部局各撥十二萬五千元現已收到者有工部局之十二萬五千元及市政府之五萬元兩共十七萬五千元第一次定米一千五百噸即一萬五千担刻已到滬以一萬二千担分配於原有之平米發售處餘三千担則將來租界特區舉辦地點擬在天后宮内售價定爲每升三百八十文合計每担十三元左右比市價每担可便宜兩元將來特區平米處辦法與其他平民處稍有不同他處發售每人祗限五升但特區則寛放至每人五斗其目的在可以救濟一般小商店小工廠及範圍狹小之包飯作預計本星期四五當可實行開辦云</p>

<p>腴多矣而態度活潑與前尤判若兩人記者問「女士明晨搭坎拿大皇后號離滬此事確耶」白英當曰一誠如君言余以明晨往香港也」言時略露驚異之狀惟其雙目則流盻四顧若告人以心中愉快安適者旣就坐述其離滬之動機謂迭接家中來信催其返粤</p>
<h3>不談訟事　記者正欲詢其此次離</h3>
<p>滬後對童三毛上訴案將如何辦理而門</p>
<p>鈴響處童三毛之長兄大毛已登階入室黄白英見之即起身延入内室略一周旋仍與記者談話謂伊離滬後其訴訟之事完全委託其律師辦理其他則不願多言焉</p>
<h3>將往法國　最後記者詢以到港後</h3>
<p>將若何解决其前途黄言此事當禀承其</p>
<p>家長之意旨而定惟人心中頗擬往法國留學而尤傾向於獨身生活是以個人前途如何一時尙難說耳不過離滬之後或可稍舒身心也談至此中國旅行社之夫役登門搬取行李記者以黄白英指揮僕役頗形忙碌因即興辭而退</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲（與其友乙同在餐館中餐罷之後）—這侍者好不客氣。給了他半塊錢的小帳。他謝也不謝。</p>
<p>乙—倘不給他。看他如何。</p>
<p>侍者（聽得了他們二人的話。回過頭來。）—先生。我們有我們的規矩的。客人們所給的小帳。倘在一元以内。我們惟有行注目禮。表示照收。若是碰出來一塊大洋。那我們纔開口道謝了。</p>
<p>母—孩子。你又在和人相打麽。怎麽落掉了兩個門牙。</p>
<p>兒—母親。没有落掉。這兩個門牙我已包好了藏在抽斗裏。</p>
<p>船上的管事—太太。我已關照侍者們對於你服侍得特别的周到。你怎麽還是老不滿意。你到底要甚麽啊。</p>

<h3>今年國慶的我聞</h3>
<p>— 沈衡莊</p>
<p>强盛的國家。偉大的國民。對於祖國的國慶。每使我們很明顯地看見他們的狂熱。和種種含有興奮性的狂歡。法國民主紀念就是一個例子。</p>
<p>但是迴顧到我們的中國。國慶偉大的紀念。除了當局召集的刻版的紀念會之外。由人民自動聯合舉行的盛會。簡直是没有。這未免使其他强盛的國家。竊笑我們國民的無國家思想。我們自己也不免對外示弱吧。</p>
<p>現在國慶的偉大紀念。在一轉瞬之間又要到了。要是國民仍舊這樣的冷淡下去。終覺對建國的中山先生有些慚愧吧。可是我在這沉寂的態度之中。聽得一個興奮的消息。就是今年的國慶。上海有許多商界的新人物。和社交塲中的新靑年。已在準備聯合起來。舉行一個盛大的慶祝會。預備和法國及其他强盛的國家競賽一下。地點聽說巳包定大華飯店。預料在那一天上。一定有許多熱心的份子。乘着狂興。陶醉在樂聲之下呢。</p>
<h3>一言致命之慘劇</h3>
<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>餘姚横河有醫生陸杏堃者。初無藉藉名。近數年來。醫運亨通。遠近皆赴之。每逢二五八日。更至小橋頭應診。其地則去横河三十里。上月下浣某日。陸自小橋頭應觀海衛某姓之聘。及歸。時已晏矣。陸出。輒乘自備之脚划船。是日亦然。船行至甘露庵相近之太平橋畔。岸上有人問曰。若船載陸先生否。船人答曰然。曰。然則稍停。船人未及應。則岸上者已躍入船。數之得三人。手執手槍。入船。即搜陸之槖。得十餘元。盡出之。又取陸所御之長衫。陸憤。乃謂之曰。若輩勿爾。我識若也。盜聞言。怒且驚。遽以槍擊陸。洞胸。盜悉索舟中所有逸去。船人駭極。不能出聲。欲載還家而治之。未半里而陸死矣。船人乃報官。并告人如此。噫。古有三語作椽。而陸乃以一言喪身。何其不幸耶。然爲盜者。皆亡命之徒。彼且忘己之生。又何能顧他人之生耶。假使陸稍忍須臾。暫作痴聾。何至畢命彈下哉。語曰。維口興戎。誠不謬矣。比聞兇手業已緝獲。是則盜固可爲而不可爲也。</p>
<h3>印度建築世界佛學苑</h3>

<h3>中國的有聲電影</h3>
<p>— 北宮</p>
<p>幾個月前。給一家影戲院的誘人的廣告所動。說「開映國産有聲片。」跑去一看。不禁失望。原來依舊是無聲影片。不過用了兩個活人依照片中演員所說的話來說一遍罷了。這一件事。實屬滑稽得很。據說。在當時電影檢查會因其意圖朦混。曾經去函警告。到現在。果然已經不見。但於此我就感覺到中國眞正的有聲電影之應時而産生。實是一件必須的事。</p>
<p>在上海一埠而論。國人的金錢。在外國影片項下漏到外國去的。很多很多。自從有聲影片盛行以來。爲數更可驚了。國人徒驚其新奇。習於時髦。羣相趨之。然而外國有聲片中的談話。恐怕聽得清楚的很少吧。我們即使抛開了金錢的漏巵講。在觀影者的趣味方面。也總覺得减低不少。</p>
<p>倘如中國能自己創製眞正的有聲電影的話。至少有兩點好處。一、乘此機會使國人恢復對於國産影片的信仰心。二、國人看國産有聲片。當然親切有味。因此可以使外國有聲影片受一打擊。</p>
<p>不久以前。據傳說。明星影片公司决定創製有聲影片了。一部一部都已試騐。確實有美滿的成績。决不是滑頭性質的一種投機。其第一片聞已定名爲「歌女紅牡丹」依此看來。中國的電影史上又添上了新的光榮的一面。而「完全歌舞完全對白」八個字。也不再讓外國影片專美於前了。</p>
<p>就事實來觀察。這確實是我國電影事業一個最好的復興的機會。那麽我希望明星公司對於這第一部的有聲片。應該格外審愼。格外小心。因爲衰落的電影事業。它的未來的生命完全倚靠着這一部有聲片啊。來了。我還希望明星公司能把攝製的經過發表出來。使我們能夠知道些他們的努力的成績。</p>
<h3>記屈尙漁割股事</h3>
<p>— 蔣瘦石</p>
<p>割股。愚孝也。識者非之。然處此滄海横流之世。能爲此孝之愚者。幾何人哉。於是不得不賢尙漁之孝與其孝之愚。尙漁姓屈氏。海巫人。好學深思。與人落落寡言笑。豪於飲。醉後。則無所不談。蓋性情中人也。精繪事。粥藝滬上。聲譽甚著。其嚴君荆才先生者。老成碩望。行三。人咸稱之謂三先生。供職省垣。以病遄返。尙漁亦馳至。而三先生病已篤。尙漁心惻然。念無以療其親乃效割股事。期以格天。夜深。屏人設香案。禱畢。以利剪剪其臂。瑟然有聲。創痕如盞。而血濡濡不流。急趨藥灶。以肉擲罐内。凉風忽至。爐火熒然。將沸。肉忽躍出。再擲之。又如前。三擲之。始己。乃捧湯以進。時三先生神識尙清。服之有異。嚴詰之。始得其實。相向哭失聲。越二日。三先生卒不起。余友尙漁久。頗知其爲人。其所以出此者。亦求其心之所安耳。不知有孝。遑論乎孝之愚不愚。而世必以孝歸之。豈其願哉。三先生之兄。字蔭周。耗聞。慟幾絶。一門孝友。始知尙漁之所禀。有自來已。嗚呼。均足感焉。</p>
<h3>最近德國政潮解剖（上）</h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>德國政局由危而安。由安復危。其變化結果常出人意外。自第恃立喜（Ｄielrich）繼摩爾登好。（Moldenhauer）爲財長後。吾人以爲布律寗（Bruning）内閣勢力較厚。可以穩定一時矣。不料自上星期來。因總務問題。政府與議會各走極端。相持旬日。無法妥協。今政府竟以解散議會聞矣。</p>
<p>此次事變外表雖與以前不同。但自其裡面觀之。仍有其一致性。蓋政府與國會之爭永遠爲財政問題。前財長摩爾登好之去職。即因其欲加國人以一種犧牲稅之負擔。現在第特立喜又以同樣問題在國會遭遇同樣困難。但此次内閣態度雖硬。布律寗總理受興登堡總統全權委任。决排除萬難以圖貫澈其政策。於是始終阻礙政府政策之議會卒被解散。茲將其經過情形略爲言之。</p>
<p>最近德政府因國用不足。由財長第特立喜建議增收百分之五之所得稅及獨身稅等。以謀補救。但此提案於本月十二日以十五票對十三票爲議會國庫委員會所否决。當時財長鑒於在該委員會形勢不利。遂聲明原案不再由該委員會覆核。逕交國會公决。</p>
<p>經過兩日舌戰。十六日議會又以二五六對二○四將政府提案打消。但同日興登堡總統已授權内閣總理布律寗。遇必要時得依據憲法四十八條之規定由政府以指令公佈新稅案。或竟解散議會。於是當晚布律寗總理即發出數種命令。凡俸給收入每年在二千馬克以上者徵收百分之二·五之犧牲稅。每年所得收入在八千馬克以上者補徵百分之五之所得稅。又歲入在二六四○馬克以上之獨身男女徵收百分之十之獨身稅。</p>
<p>政府命令發出之後。社會民主黨即提出撤消政府命令案。十八日投票結果。撤消政府命令案成立。於是政府無路可走。不得不宣佈解散議會矣。</p>
<p>此次布律寗總理因得興登堡總統倚任。斷然解散議會。在政治上雖不免有獨裁之嫌。然亦出於萬不得已。因内閣在議會旣全無聯結多數之可能。而所定財政方針爲德意志現在及將來計。又必不能免也。且從德意志國家的立場者塲觀察與從國際的立塲觀察同。解散議會而重行選舉或尙愈於與全受囂震柏（Ｈugenberg）支配之右派合作。（當議會投票之前。囂氏曾以右派領袖資格與政府接洽。因所提條件苛酷。不爲内閣接受。遂投反對票焉。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二六二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　是誰種福無意得鑽環　惟此因緣有心歌金縷</p>
<p>懺儂坐定了以後。左詩晨向伊道。我不知道你出來。還是剛纔那跟左翠雲的阿寳說起了。方纔知道。懺儂淡淡的笑了一笑。左詩晨看伊這一笑。很覺難過。這一笑顯見得並非自中心發出。而且那一笑有無限說不出的苦味藏在其中。這便是一種苦笑了。兩人暫時沉點了一下。懺儂取了一面金的小鏡子後面的粉紙。向鼻子上抹了一抹。便道。二少。我們有三四年不見了。你看我老得怎麽樣。憑着老實話說。左詩晨眞要說的確你是老得多了。但看了懺儂可憐的樣子。也只得作一作違心之言。便道。不見得。還是從前那個樣子。懺儂又是悽然的一笑。說道。還是從前的樣子嗎。我自己知道老了許多了。左詩晨不願聽伊再說下去。便剪住伊的話道。你看我也老了不少了呢。懺儂道。你是一點不覺得老。眞的和從前一樣。男人老一點有什麽關係。我們女人老了。一世就完結了。左詩晨道。好好兒的你爲什麽又出來了呢。懺儂道。你此地散了。到我生意上來吧。這不是兩三句話可以講得完的。况且現在在這個地方也不好講呢。左詩晨道。今天我是被動做主人。只怕散席是不早的了。懺儂道。那末你明天來。明天早一些來。要講我的事。兩三個鐘頭頭也講不完。你們倘然做起小說來。可以做厚厚的一本咧。横豎我現在堂唱很少。你到我那裏來吃夜飯。地方是在百花底。百花底現在只有我們一家堂子了。左詩晨想百花底的確没有去過。從前做過一個燈謎。謎面是「開到茶蘼春事了」的一句成詩。打上海一個地名。謎底就是「百花底」了。因了這個燈謎。迴想到翠筠年華過去。眞如逝水。已到了春事闌珊。紅紫漫爛的光陰。宛如一瞥無痕。伊偏偏住到百花底這個地方。眞個欲向東皇。訴遲暮之情了。再回頭看看懺儂時。雖然低鬟微笑。然而一笑中。眉梢眼角。自然而然的露出了皺紋。已經不是憑着脂粉的力量所可以掩飭。中年的暮氣。驀然地鑽進了伊的血液裏去。再也不能清除。大概伊這嫁人以後三四年的功夫。所受的熬煎。也可想而知。因爲伊雖然是一個沉靜派的姑娘。從前有清微澹遠的批評。但是到現今看來。那個活潑的心情。也已被頺表的環境所啃嚼壞了。</p>

<p>市場概况　昨日星期一、銀行收解較繁而錢業方面亦適逢二十五比期、公單手續亦頗忙碌、至於市氣之優劣、大都與前數日相類、厘價回跌數毫、銀拆仍其舊觀、而客路洋欵銷胃依然不弱、昨有一百餘萬出口、廣角又有來源、而去胃中輟、形勢遂告疲軟耳、</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）昨晨因人心稍軟、結果回跌、爲七錢二分九厘二毫半、較前日早市小去六毫二忽半、午市去胃頗旺、而供方亦勇、於是市價與早市相同、仍爲七錢二分九厘二毫半、（銀拆）早午兩市仍開二分、銀行掛牌及劃頭加水終無市况、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋較前日午市改昻半厘、爲六錢四分五厘半、早午兩市一式、做出交易早市二千五百角、午市三千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢二分四厘、午市爲六錢二分三厘八毫七忽半、結果較前日早市賡續跌小二厘一毫二忽半、做出交易早市九萬五千角、午市二萬五千角、銅元又縮五百文、爲三百九十千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出（銀欵）昨日銀行收解似較瑣繁、票欵收解甚多、華商收解票欵三百四五十萬、外商收解票欵三百八九十萬、特欵收解二百七八十萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解亦有一千○數十萬、出倉一百三十萬其他補理收解亦不少、日商銀行收解各欵五百三四十萬、出倉七十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千五百餘萬、劃頭欵收解五百二十餘萬、各路匯欵收解一百三十餘萬、收現二百餘萬、寄庫欵甚多、（洋欵）匯劃票欵早市做出一百六十五萬、午市做出九十八萬、鈔票祗午市四萬、中山新幣早市十萬、午市五萬五千、場外鈔票早市十九萬五千、午市十二萬二千、中山新幣早市三萬五千、午市十五萬、客路裝出額一百十餘萬、來源三十餘萬、銀行方面互市交易早市五十五萬、午市四十五萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百五十餘萬、鈔票進出二百二十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解七百二十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百二十餘萬、拆借洋欵一百八十餘萬、小錢莊收兌鈔票售出新幣匯頭等交易七八十萬、本街彚集額四十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證劵債價漲勢仍勁</h3>
<p>昨日各公債市况、期貨仍極盛、賣買人氣依然活潑、現貨惟編遣進出較多　其他續仍沉靜、至各債價之趨勢、續以時局形勢樂觀、市上人心良好、投資買進較旺、債價每盤步漲、計裁兵價漲最鉅、現貨躍高四元餘、期貨漲二元半左右、編遣約續漲一元半、關稅續捲善後等亦均漲頗鉅、整六續二五金融九六等較前雖亦趨漲、惟爲數殊微、計全日現貨交易二萬元、期貨計達一千四百餘萬、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市在衰頽狀態中</h3>
<p>紗市形勢甚衰、實以原棉鬆動、潮帮買力甚勁、據云滬埠存紗又有增加說、而美棉情勢、一時仍難轉漲、故大戶抛念殊深、然某廠及粤帮將本月份了結不少、遠月大昌成購進加碼、包額亦巨　　人標抛風高壓　人標前市開盤、市氣尙堅、買方購進加碼、漲五錢、二三盤以金業帮買出、市盤騾跌、形勢衰弱、近跌一兩、結果近跌一三五錢、遠平、午後聞現紗客銷未旺、原棉大跌、人心不振、各月跌四六九錢至一兩二三錢、全日成交統計二萬二千九百包、查買進大昌成二千九百包、恒益一千一百包、和愼五百五十包、森康恒德義成泰昌長豐天昌裕大賡豐漢豐協生瑞大三百包至七百五十包、賣出達豐二千一百五十包、泰興七百五十包、榮興九百包、大孚公泰達記同餘愼裕愼記信誠德記永豐元泰三百五十包至六百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市步開步落</h3>
<p>棉市甚虚、邇日天氣晴正、新棉進行良好、多頭因日後天時如無變化、則出數可以日湧、廠商因陳花過剩、無採辦之必要、故人心驟虚、印度紗廠又有幾廠停閉、於是賣風愈熾、本月份某廠商結進之三萬五千担、業已轉託某經紀商如數售出、足見各廠原料充足、賣方預備交貨、約有三萬多担、本月份明日尙有變化云、</p>
<p>本月漢標降達七錢　漢標前市開盤、以美棉平靜、場内市氣尙堅、各月未動、二三盤以處暑氣候順利、各路産棉日漸上市、賣戶稍盛、各跌三錢、午後因本月份在某號賣出愈跌、遠月尤虚、各跌四錢至一錢半、全日成交統計七萬一千三百担、買進榮興六千担、裕大四千一百担、愼昌二千六百担、梅記森康昌記永豐天成動豐愼裕天昌信誠一千二百担至二千担、賣出泰昌六千八百担、義成三千八百担、天隆二千四百担、長豐二千二百担、恒昌寳記公泰元泰一千担至九百担、茲將漢標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>上週印棉存减市堅</h3>
<p>英棉初挺後軟</p>
<p>孟買　上週市况堅定、因存底减少、現需甚佳、本地廠商僅於廉宜之價、略購若干、疋頭需要甚劣、歐洲方面、對於奥姆辣花、問訊頗衆、惟裝運不多、聊省方面、天氣續佳、有豐收之希望、奔傑方面、天氣與收成均利、辛特方面、稍有蟲害、其他各地、情形均佳、奥姆辣需雨甚殷、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市跌風轉銳</h3>
<p>東新粳突甩一元　　閘北　昨日各檔到船十餘號、走銷一蹶不振、北粳須新鮮貨略有問津、故高次行情又跌三四角之鉅、刻下市上高貨約在二十元零五六角之間矣、趨勢之萎疲、殊所罕有、東新粳到源湧旺、買氣清淡、各方存底售意急切、因此價格陡短一元、祗開十七元半、綜計數日内狂短兩三元之多、跌風殊銳也、薄稻來源微接、銷化大滯、大盤步跌兩三角、該貨雖跌而交易仍無、市形異常呆木、新客尖急轉直下、連日北路來貨已見不少　高貨較之前盤所交之頂尖尙佳、而行情因情况之下游、祗開頂特尖十四元、市普通高十三元四五角、須回落四角左右之譜、白元回風亦烈、買氣凋零、頂元勉開十八元半、計又小兩角許、全日此間米情一律猛削、此乃久抱觀望意欲扳售之客戶所造成也、</p>
<p>滬南　河下來源續有、本埠銷化呆而少交、常帮機粳與蘇同破粳一致告軟、各買戶並勿以貨薄爲念、實緣洋米充斥、本街店存均豐、且東新旺到、西新行將上市、一般貨客鑒粳市前途不勝悲觀、太都急於脫售、因此號稱平和之南市昨　　　　　　　市形之無神　戎　　　　　　　問甚少、東新與北市相彷、變元到銷均漢、價亦續疲角外、</p>
<h3>蕪湖新客秈已到申</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、初居疲象、繼有内地帮購辦中次貨、天津帮亦辦去一號西貢一千包、市面隨轉穩站之局、下午續有内地鄉莊問津、市形慮見平穩、計開出一號西貢千五百包、價十六元零二分至十五元三角半、二號五百包、價十三元七角半、大絞五百包、價十二元半至十一元八角、次小絞一百包、價十四元半、可蓋米一百包、價十五元二角半、</p>
<p>各路客秈均已登塲、收成以湖南最佳、蕪湖江西亦比去年爲佳、蕪湖離申較近、新米首批業已裝到、計二百四十六包、價開十一元六角七分、連佣十一元八角、由天津帮辦去云、</p>
<h3>標粉市極佳秀</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開市後、本月份期有粉立有空頭抵補、市形甚佳、開價即爲二兩五錢七分二五、廠家以存粉不多、多不願交割現粉、而南北洋客帮則有一部份預備收購棧單、市面愈見穩固、遠期上午甚軟、買賣均無注意、下午洋粉麥因金市划大、市面立見緊俏、抛出之客戶亦多收抵、行情乃反比本月份爲俏、收市本月份大一分、下月份大五厘、十月十一月十二月各大一分二厘半、正月份則大至一分七五云、</p>
<h3>近期麥陡漲五分</h3>
<p>昨日麥市開盤後、各月份市價均見奇俏、仍因洋麥划漲、現麥到少、人心乃均看好之故　遠期各月份繼有客戶套出、略見平軟、本月份則以現麥缺乏高貨廠家互相爭辦、空頭因交割在邇不敢再擯、逐步逐漲、收市大有五分、九·十月份各帶好二分、十一月十二月正月各好三分、現麥祗有中關貨到下高貨缺乏、廠胃甚貪、價乃又好五分、售開各路火貨四千餘包、爲大小各廠分去云</p>
<h3>南北貨　漳同桂圓同時登新</h3>
<p>漳州同安所産桂圓、本屆登新收成尙佳、查昨日太古公司之濟南號輪、由厦人口、漳同首批新貨、均有運到、共計六百餘箱、其中大小式貨皆全、初次自必穩俏、大約今明日可以開盤、粤貨前數日已到、惟屬中小粒、市勢平常、其餘如泉泡圓旬日後可到、興化圓則尙需二十餘天可到、今庚各處收成、均尙可觀、後市必有步鬆之望云</p>
<h3>絲茶紐約日絲價猛跌</h3>
<p>廠銷停滯······價均傾跌二三角</p>
<p>紐約市塲、近因各絲織廠紛紛减機停工、生絲銷費大减、絲銷不振、上週末日絲廠銷停滯　絲價猛跌、Ａ級每磅祗開三元四角、Ｂ級二元九角、Ｃ級二元四角、計跌美金二三角云、</p>
<h3>茶市異常清淡</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市頗形清淡、杜德永興錦隆等行、對於高莊珍眉雖略有進胃、但售擊甚低、針眉秀眉等貨、亦無大宗交易、市甚　落云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　細斜漲風最烈</h3>
<p>東貨因匯票漲而復活</p>
<p>西貨元絨等亦形見動</p>
<p>本廠棉布　日來市面漲跌互見、細布略軟、　　昨藍雙魚彩球均售六兩九錢半、陽鶴六兩九錢二分半、吉祥因日華廠罷工未已、仍無現貨、藍飛魚秦皇島帮需要又殷、開七兩三錢亦無現貨、細斜漲風頗烈、本街搜辦甚烈、致各牌均現新高價、陽鶴售七兩零七分半、藍雙魚六兩八錢七分半、金城六兩九錢二分半、粗布趨勢平定　十六磅五鶴仍七兩二錢、雙象七兩、十四磅喂馬無貨、十一磅布均四兩七錢、</p>
<p>東西疋頭　邇因匯票又漲、故復呈活潑之象、東貨昨均上漲、直貢緞高二厘半、第一功爲二錢九分、四學士無貨、鵲橋會二錢七分、焦葉題書二錢六分七厘半、直貢呢漲勢更烈司馬相如已須三錢四分、三潭三錢三分半、斷檔已久之長板橋已有運到、開三錢三分、雙童鹿售二錢六分半、本埠内外廠出品之四君子昨已售開二錢四分二厘半、新花直貢呢色子貢花絨本街甚爲活動、昨成交有百餘件、西貨冲西緞漲一分、沙遜天官售三錢四分、公平九財童於三錢三分半售罄、只六元絨復略活潑云、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵皮成交五六百扎</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮市面、邇來北路客帮需胃漸動、故昨日開出有五六百扎之鉅、而購進者統係天津烟台大連各帮、而牛莊營口諸帮、聞亦有點綴、查市上現貨不多、此後行情或有升漲、計刻市三六尺估九兩、二六尺開十兩零五錢云、</p>

<p>世界新聞社譯日本雜誌云、日本經濟界受戰後經濟危機及大震災之影響、今日已陷於不振之深淵、政府苦心謀打破現狀之法、認爲惟有提倡國内生産的工業、以鞏固國民經濟之基礎、增進國際出納之均衡、庶克有濟、爰有使用國貨之運動、政府對此、曾廣事調查、商工省編有國貨調查錄一書、紀載國内生産的工業之實况、一面調查銷費物品之種類、將自製品之種類、將自製品及舶來品逐項比較、分爲數類、即（一）必須仰給於國外者、（二）國内不能生産者、（三）國内有自製品而價太貴者、（四）國内有自製品而質地惡劣不宜於用者、（五）具有其他特殊情形者、由專家將各類貨品詳細審查比較、結果則使專家爲之驚異、蓋有許多舶來品能由日本自製品代之也、</p>

<h3>法國進行中之新衛生運動</h3>
<p>目的爲「防病於未然」</p>
<p>大學敎授信疾病可完全消滅</p>
<p>法國對於促進健康及消弭疾病、現有一大新運動在進行中、其主旨可以一語括之、曰「防病於未然」、</p>
<p>此運動於去年開始於阿爾薩斯州之斯脫拉斯堡市、由斯脫拉斯堡大校敎務長下令、凡該校醫科學生於入校之始、須經醫生詳細檢騐身體、受愛克司光照騐數次、以照其身體是否健康、此舉之用意、爲「此等學生將來皆以醫爲業、較任何人易與病者接觸、故需要身理上之大抵抗力、彼等旣將被乃以治他人之疾、亦知所以自治其疾乎、彼等旣須警誠他人、亦知所以自誡乎、</p>
<p>該校醫藥生共九十七名（其中十一名爲女生、）檢騐之後、知有二十四名染有病痛、但彼等或未自覺、或雖覺而不自知其嚴重、其中有五分之四以檢查局部之結果、察得其齒牙不健全、凡經檢騐諸生當然許其入校肄業、但對其生理之弱點、則予以警告、使彼等自知愼重、是即對其生活之路加以指導也、</p>
<p>此項試騐方法、爲法政府敎育總長所聞、甚爲贊許、决將其擴充至一切公私學校、自本年一月起、一巴黎中學校仿行此法、一切男女生均受同樣檢騐、每三個月複行一次、該校印成一小書、名曰「衛生錄」分給諸生、書中記明每次檢騐之結果、同時按期量諸生之體格、俾至體操宜至何程度、又何種體操最爲有益、亦列記於書中、如是有種種便利（一）該生如有病、由家屬請醫時、該醫可由此知其平時之缺點、（二）校中之生理敎育敎師可依此施敎、（三）將來各該生升入中學或大學時、學校當局亦由此可知各該生之身體情形而分别注意、總之、此種方法有利無弊、</p>
<p>法國諸科學家咸熱心於此試騐、如有各巴斯士學院之敎授馬卓格氏云、「防病遠易於治病環顧吾人之四周、疾痛慘苦、日有所聞、醫藥失其權威、然苟及早予以注意、則病可不作、最大之錯誤、爲不知衛生、聽其自然、至病發而呼痛、則無及矣、若能按期診查、則能查出健康之敵於其隱藏處也、</p>
<p>又一科學家希拉般氏云、「衛生方法爲消極的、彼僅告汝以何者不可爲某種錯誤應避免、反之、預防治療方法則爲積極的、彼預先告汝以何者必須爲、以保汝之健康於受脅害之處、引擎汽車升降機皆每日檢查、人之器官豈可不按期檢騐耶、斯脫拉斯堡大學之梅克林敎授最歡贊此項方法、且曰、「在余意確信世界終有一日疾病完全消滅、人將止死於老年而不死於病」云、</p>
<h3>水蒸氣之新代用品</h3>
<p>水蒸氣在現代文明中、功用極大、但方法尙嫌其太爲呆笨、且又有爆裂危險、故科學家尙孜孜不息、以求有以代之者、今果得成效矣、</p>
<p>新物名曰熱讓Ｈeat　Transte學名爲Ｄiphenyl、爲一種化學之併合産品、不存於原態、所含熱量極大、又毫無水蒸氣壓力過大之危險、熱度至七百度時、熱讓祇有六十五磅壓力、而水蒸氣則至一千磅以上也、</p>
<p>兩年以前、有油商欲以物品化水蒸氣於煉汽油之工作中、但未成功、蓋當時美國祗有熱讓一磅、值至四十元、後亞拉巴麥省伯明漢有少年之化學師施文梯奥回Theodre　Swann者大批製造、今則每磅祇值三角矣、</p>
<p>熱讓製有爆裂炭化水素Explosive　Benzne以熱力將炭化水素中之兩個氢原子逐出、而合成新物、其形狀爲微黄之白色固體、融於華氏表一五五度、</p>
<p>熱讓已證明爲一極有用之物、曾製成琥珀色之脂膠、黑色之　、及灰色之透明同體、而用於製造凡尼司漆、絶緣品、防火品、及不透水品、（雋山）</p>
<h3>橡皮滯貨九個月</h3>
<p>結果恐將限制生産</p>

<p>紐約一五五、○○○其他　一五、○○○</p>
<p>倫敦一一○、○○○運輸中九○、○○○</p>
<p>新加坡三五、○○○合計四○五、○○○</p>
<p>馬來　四○、○○○</p>
<p>此存貨額、依世界之橡皮總需要額七十一萬噸每月平均需要額六萬噸計算時、約有七個半月之滯貨、而由本年之生産額八十四萬噸中扣除總需要額七十一萬噸、尙餘十三萬噸、與去年底之存貨四十二萬七千噸合計、至本年底、存貨約五十五萬九千噸、即滯貨約九個月、一方美國市面之不振、漸趨深刻、橡皮之需要未見增加、反有减退之傾向、前途之不安益加、遂有上項之廉價、於此狀態下、無論生産者、即橡皮經售業者亦不免失敗、英國或有限制橡皮生産之議、生産限制問題前由荷蘭栽培業者提倡、因英方冷淡未有成議、今日價奇廉、或將釀成此種形勢而限制生産云、</p>

<h3>Ironclad Evidence of World Book Company's Standard English Readers Plagiarizing Kaiming English Readers</h3>
<p>The Kaiming English Readers published by our store were compiled by Mr. Lin Yutang, former professor of Peking University. The first volume was published in August of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], and the second and third volumes were published in July and September of the following year [1929]. Mr. Lin spent more than ten years of his effort to meticulously research and ponder before he could complete the book. Its novel compilation and uniquely creative style were quickly praised by scholars and teachers throughout the country. On February 26th of this year, it was examined and approved by the Ministry of Education and granted license number 38. Unexpectedly, World Book Company published three volumes of Standard English Readers in February and April of this year, respectively. Its style, compilation, content, form, and even the words and pictures were almost entirely imitated and plagiarized from the Kaiming English Readers, making it difficult to distinguish between the two at first glance. Considering this an intentional infringement of copyright, our store extracted the key points and entrusted a friend to advise the company, requesting that it voluntarily cease publication. However, the company, besides directly admitting that a poem on page 101 of the third volume was copied from the Kaiming Readers and expressing its willingness to modify it, made specious and evasive arguments on all other points. Without prior consultation, it claimed that "great minds think alike," confusing right and wrong and defying reason. Having no other choice, on July 26th, we entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to the company requesting a reply. On the 27th, the English editor of the company, Mr. Lin Handa, who was also the author of the book, personally visited Mr. Lin Yutang's residence requesting a peaceful resolution, proposing to moderately revise the points of imitation and plagiarism. Mr. Lin Yutang told him that he had to consult with our store. On the 28th, the editor-in-chief of the company, Mr. Fan Yunliu, sent a letter to Mr. Zhang Xichen of our store, introducing Mr. Lin Handa for discussion, stating that the book was indeed compiled using the methods of the Kaiming Readers. However, due to a lack of understanding of copyright law, the content and form inevitably had similarities, hoping for forgiveness. Mr. Zhang told him that he would consult with the store authorities and Mr. Lin Yutang before replying. On the morning of the 29th, Mr. Lin Handa personally came to Mr. Zhang again to ask for a reply, but Mr. Zhang was out, so he left a note. In the afternoon, Mr. Zhang sent a letter to Mr. Lin Handa stating the results of the discussion, agreeing to a peaceful resolution, but only if the company acknowledged three preconditions. The first condition was that the author of the book had to revise the book according to the wishes of the author of the Kaiming Readers. After receiving the letter, Mr. Lin Handa personally visited Mr. Lin Yutang on the same day, but Mr. Lin Yutang was out, so he left another note stating that he was seeking advice on how to revise the book for a peaceful resolution. The next morning, he personally visited Mr. Lin Yutang again to inquire about the actual methods of revision. Mr. Lin Yutang indicated three principles for revision: (1) copied sentences, (2) instances where several places in one lesson were similar, and (3) deliberately imitated layout and form. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Lin Handa left, the company's entrusted lawyer sent a letter completely shifting the responsibility to Mr. Lin Handa personally and denying that they had ever admitted to plagiarism. Our store again asked the lawyer to refute, stating that Mr. Lin Handa was an employee hired by the company, and the book was published by the company, so how could they shift the responsibility? Furthermore, the facts of plagiarism were clear and could not be concealed by empty words. The company's lawyer's reply did not mention a single word about the first point, and regarding the second point, he relayed Mr. Lin Handa's claim that he admitted to the English poem in the third volume.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Editorial Department of World Book Company</h3>
<p>Mr. Xichen,</p>
<p>I have not had the pleasure of your company for a long time. I am extremely concerned for your well-being.</p>
<p>Recently, due to business, I deeply admire your company. It has come to my attention that there is a misunderstanding regarding the Standard English Readers published by our company and the Kaiming English Readers published by your esteemed company. I have especially sent Mr. Lin Hanlian, the original editor from our new department, to clarify everything and hope to dispel any misunderstandings.</p>
<p>With utmost respect,</p>
<p>[Signature]</p>
<p>July</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Fan Yunliu (Xiangshan), Editor-in-Chief of the Editorial Department of World Book Company, which Mr. Lin Handa carried with him on his first visit to the store.</p>
<p>Mr. Xichen,</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was very informative. I understand that you also wish for a peaceful resolution. Your lawyer will be in contact in three days. At the moment, our company wishes to know whether this matter can be resolved by Mr. Da [Lin Handa] himself, or whether our company needs to respond to your lawyer. If it is as we discussed yesterday, then I will relay this to your lawyer.</p>
<p>I await your instructions. With best regards,</p>
<p>Lin Handa</p>
<p>July 29th</p>
<p>Note left by Mr. Lin Handa on his second visit to our store.</p>
<p>Indeed adopted the Kaiming Readers and was willing to voluntarily modify, but did not admit to admitting plagiarism and said that the matter was unintentional and the problem was extremely small. Upon investigation, Mr. Lin Handa was an English editor hired by the company. On his first visit to the store, he carried a letter from the editor-in-chief of the company. On his second visit to the store, he left a note saying, "Our company wants to know whether this matter can be resolved by Da [Lin Handa] himself." It can be seen that his two visits to the store and three visits to Mr. Lin Yutang were all on behalf of the company. Therefore, all his words and actions to our store and Mr. Lin Yutang can be regarded as representing the company's words and actions. How can the company shift the responsibility? If the company's editing of this book was indeed original and did not infringe on the copyright of other people's works, why would it try so hard to shift the responsibility? This is evidenced by the letter from the editor-in-chief of the company, which already stated, "The Standard English Readers published by our company have been heard to be suspiciously similar to the Kaiming English Readers published by your esteemed company." Furthermore, the company's lawyer's letter also confirmed that the third volume of the book used materials from the Kaiming Readers. I ask, what is the difference between "using" and "copying"? Moreover, Mr. Lin Handa repeatedly visited Mr. Lin Yutang and left a note asking for advice on how to revise the book. If he had not first admitted to plagiarism, why would he readily agree to voluntarily revise it? Assuming that only one English poem was modified, why would he ask Mr. Lin Yutang for advice? It is a self-evident fact that he plagiarized our store's readers and infringed on our store's copyright. The company first admitted it, then became evasive, repeatedly reversing itself, truly revealing its true colors. World Book Company is one of China's leading bookstores, yet it violates publishing ethics and disregards social integrity to such an extent that it is truly disheartening. In addition to requesting a legal resolution from the authorities, we are specifically disclosing the process of the negotiations and the company's documents to seek public judgment from all sectors. The similarities and resemblances between the two books can be discerned with a glance by discerning people. Even the company has already admitted it, so there is no need for further criticism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our store recently received promotional leaflets from the Fuzhou branch of World Book Company promoting the company's secondary school textbooks. The leaflets included a notice from the Fujian Provincial Department of Education to provincial middle schools and county education bureaus, stating that according to the report submitted by Mr. Shen Zhifang, General Manager of World Book Company in Shanghai, the junior high school Chinese textbooks and other books have been examined and approved by the Ministry of Education, requesting that they be notified to adopt them. (Omission in the middle) It is ordered that the principals of the said schools and bureaus should immediately notify their subordinates to adopt them. All textbooks examined and approved by the Ministry of Education are published in the Ministry of Education Gazette. According to regulations, the words "Examined and Approved by the Ministry of Education on [date]" must be printed on the books. How many kinds of secondary school textbooks of the company have been examined and approved by the Ministry of Education? Why have they not been seen in the Gazette? If they have indeed been examined and approved but have not been printed on the books, it is a clear violation of the Ministry's regulations. Otherwise, it is falsely claiming examination and approval, deceiving the authorities and deceiving schools. The local procuratorate should immediately report the company. The company still wants to cover up the facts, which are so obvious, with one hand covering the eyes of the world. Its deception and betrayal of our store is futile, and it has no scruples. Therefore, we are specifically informing you so that all sectors may know the tricks of World Book Company.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Handa's business card and note from his second visit to Mr. Lin Yutang</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang,</p>
<p>I would like to ask for advice on how to revise [the book] for a peaceful resolution. It would be convenient to reply to me in three days... Please call the bureau at 4 pm. I hope you will not be out.</p>
<p>Lin Handa, English Editor, World Book Company</p>

<h3>Second International Parliament Expresses Support for Indian Autonomy</h3>
<p>During the recent meeting of the Executive Committee of the Second International Parliament, the resolution on the India issue was unanimously supported by all parties except for the British representative, who did not vote. From this, it can be seen that India's demand for autonomy is not only considered natural by India itself, but no one in other countries considers it unnatural. The only opponents are the British. From this, it can also be seen that the British are not only reluctant to grant autonomy to India because they hold imperialist views, but even the representatives of socialism, because of Britain, are unwilling to vote. It can be deeply seen that their love of ideology is no match for their love of country.</p>
<p>There are only two principles that drive the continuous succession and change of human affairs in the world: one is based on reason, and the other is in accordance with the trend. Every nation should be independent and autonomous, and the demand for autonomy is beyond reproach. Moreover, since the trend after the European War, countless previously oppressed nations have been liberated and become independent and autonomous. Why single out India? Therefore, India's demand for independence and autonomy is also an irresistible trend. Since it is both reasonable and in accordance with the trend, the people of all countries support it. Although Britain is still trying its best to resist, the result will inevitably be in accordance with the wishes of the Indian people, because other than reason and trend, no other force can be used in the principle of human affairs succession.</p>

<h3>Central Government and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>At 9:00 am on the 25th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 74th Premier's Memorial Week in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters. Central Committee members Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Liu Liyin, Yu Jingtang, etc., and officials from various departments and ministries, as well as guests, totaled about 600 people. Shao Yuanchong presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman reported briefly that the Central Government's anti-rebellion military has recently achieved victories one after another, and the reactionary forces have collapsed, which proves that doctrine can overcome everything. However, bandits and communists are rising everywhere, and the people are in dire straits, suffering unspeakable misery. Therefore, while celebrating military victories, we must pay attention to local security and the problem of relieving the people. We must not remain indifferent. China has been in turmoil for many years, and warlords, bureaucrats, and all reactionary elements collude with the Communist Party and imperialists to launch rebellions one after another. If we want to fundamentally eliminate them, we must first understand the reasons and motives for their reaction and fundamentally transform their thinking, following the Premier's posthumous teachings, and pay special attention to psychological construction. In this regard, we can analyze and explain the following: (1) Individualism, which only knows how to benefit oneself, is the starting point of imperialism and capitalism and is absolutely in conflict with the Three Principles of the People. When expanded, it can lead to disputes between this faction and that faction, this group and that group, which can create national and social turmoil and danger and collude with any other reactionaries, disregarding the interests of the entire nation. (2) Western materialism is enough to paralyze the thinking of young people and conflict with China's inherent ethics and morality. Because of the intense competition for material progress, people are prone to abandoning their personality cultivation, but only talk about interests and not about right and wrong. All immoral behaviors can be committed without restraint. At the same time, reason is confused by it and often deviates from the principles of evolution and acts out of line, resulting in class struggles on a small scale and national turmoil on a large scale. Therefore, if we want psychological construction to succeed, we must earnestly study the crux of the problem, wash away old concepts, and transform new ideas. Then the effect of suppressing chaos and seeking governance will definitely not be shallow. The Premier said that it is easy to act when knowledge is difficult and that seeking knowledge is the top priority. Once the understanding is clear, we can use knowledge to increase the interests of the country and society, eliminate their narrow-minded prejudices, and demonstrate their spirit of serving society, not seeking social status in a calculating manner. In this way, we can gain a foothold in society and make the general public confirm that they are the leaders of society and increase their faith day by day. If we are ignorant of this purpose, but seek our own goals by any means and use power to oppress or deceive society in order to create our leadership position, we will never succeed. After the report, the meeting adjourned. On the same morning, the National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week at 10:00 am. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Wei Daoming, Lin Xiang, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Zhu Jingnong, Li Jinlun, Wang Jiazhen, Mu Xiangyue, Zhong Keto, Wu Siyu, Chen Yu, etc., and officials from the National Government's civil affairs and military affairs departments, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao made the following political report: "The crisis of youth in society. A month ago, I talked about the fact that military affairs have not yet ended, reactionary elements are still active, and many young people have fallen. For example, last Monday, the capital executed 20 communists, 15 of whom were between the ages of 20 and 30, and 2 were under the age of 20. They committed crimes and, in accordance with national laws, they must be dealt with. However, when we see this situation in society, we feel very sad. Youth is the lifeblood of the country. If a part of the youth falls, the country will suffer a part of the loss, and we should try to save them. At this moment, let us first analyze the fallen youth. A small number of the fallen youth belong to the agricultural, commercial, industrial, and academic circles, and the majority are unemployed. Why are the youth in the agricultural, commercial, and industrial circles who have jobs still unable to be content and keep to themselves? The reason, apart from those who are willing to degenerate, is mostly because their income cannot maintain or is very difficult to maintain their lives. If they want to find another way out, outside money or other temptations will take the opportunity to enter. At first, they are used by others without realizing it. Later, as the saying goes, "forced onto Liangshan," all behaviors are controlled by others, which is really pitiful. As for the fallen youth in the academic world, part of them are for livelihood problems, and part of them are entirely because of their lack of firm will. For example, the reactionary elements recently discovered everywhere include elementary school teachers and university and middle school students. Some elementary school teachers are too underpaid or are owed wages, so they take risks, a situation very similar to the fallen youth in the agricultural, commercial, and industrial circles just mentioned. The fall of students is not necessarily for food, clothing, and shelter, but really because of their lack of firm will. At the same time, the school authorities should also be responsible. If the school spirit is not good, the principal and general teachers often perfunctorily fulfill their duties. No wonder some students do not earnestly study their lessons and are easily deceived by heresies in this era of chaotic thinking. Originally, students in school are not under the control of their families. If the school authorities are still casual with them, many young people will inevitably be taken away by evil trends. To talk about the unemployed youth, their fallen situation is even more pitiful. It is very difficult for an ordinary young person to get a job in society, and life is very difficult. At first, they suffer all kinds of stimuli in both spirit and material, and slowly become angry at the world. Later, their thinking becomes more and more extreme, and all kinds of outside temptations come along. Otherwise, who would be willing to do dishonorable things when a relatively pure young person first arrives in society? Who would be willing to take risks? Who would be willing to disturb the peace and security and even meaningless burn and kill compatriots? All this is driven by the environment, and their temperament changes day by day, and their behavior goes more and more out of the ordinary. By the time they commit crimes, they are completely different from their former selves. Anyone who cares about society cannot but express concern when they see such a situation. Now let us study the methods of salvation. (1) The only way to make the youth in the agricultural, commercial, and industrial circles content and keep to themselves is to revitalize industry and promote labor-capital cooperation. Then their income will increase, their lives will be stable, and they will not be easily used by others. However, for industry to be revitalized, the country must first have long-term peace and tranquility. The central government has always been committed to peaceful construction. If it were not for the warlords' rebellion in recent years, how could the national economy and people's livelihood have been so difficult? Fortunately, the last struggle of Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, and other reactionary elements is about to be quelled. After the quelling, there will be no more wars in the country, and the government can concentrate all its manpower and financial resources on construction, and the crisis of the youth in the agricultural, commercial, and industrial circles will naturally be reduced. (2) If we want the youth in the academic world to focus on their studies, we should consider increasing the funding for places where the salaries of elementary school teachers are too low, and the municipal and county governments must find ways to raise funds. The most important thing for university and middle school students is to rectify the school spirit, and the school authorities must take responsibility, set an example, and run the school. It is not a part-time job, nor is it just hanging an empty title. You have to put in all your energy. The school cannot be used as a territory or a private property. If you do not have the ability to run it or do not have the time to run it, you should let others do it. On the one hand, the central and local governments are trying their best to raise funds so that those who run schools do not have "no rice to cook."</p>
<p>On the other hand, if it is found that there are incompetent school authorities, they should be replaced or warned, and they should not be tolerated. Various schools will start classes in a few days. It is hoped that the school spirit can be improved from this semester. (3) If we want unemployed youth not to do evil, we must first solve their livelihood problems and give them job opportunities. The only way to do this is to revitalize industry so that it can absorb countless young people to work. However, before national construction can proceed smoothly, it is best to give them appropriate relief so that they are not forced to fall into poverty and hunger. What I have said above seems to be too general. In fact, in the current environment, if we want to save the general youth who have already fallen or are about to fall, I am afraid there is no other good way. This matter is of great importance to the future of our country, and I hope everyone will pay attention to it."</p>
<h3>Major Changes in Shandong Political Circles</h3>
<p>Financial difficulties are greatly felt</p>
<p>Jinan Communication The provincial government moved back to Jinan from Qingdao on the 19th, and a major change occurred in the political circles of the province. When the provincial government moved from Jinan to Qingdao, only a few officials from various agencies followed, and the majority stayed in Jinan. When Deng Chongxi's provincial government of the Jin faction moved to Jinan, most of the old personnel were employed and very few were dismissed, especially in the Finance Department, where no one left. The provincial government in Qingdao heard that these officials were willing to be appointed by the Jin faction and was very dissatisfied. After the National Army recovered Jinan on the 15th, the provincial government committee held a discussion meeting in Qingdao on the 16th and decided that all officials from the provincial government and its subordinate departments, offices, and bureaus who had been appointed by the Jin faction in Jinan would be dismissed and that each office would notify each other not to employ them. Those suspected of colluding with the enemy would be punished separately as a warning. However, the personnel of the various agencies did not know this. When the provincial government committee's special train arrived in Jinan on the evening of the 19th, officials from the provincial government and various departments greeted them at the station with joy. However, the Secretary-General of the provincial government, Liu Fu, did not meet with the officials of the Secretariat. At 9:00 am on the 20th, the provincial committees held a discussion meeting in the provincial government and decided that the retention and dismissal of officials from various agencies would still be handled in accordance with the decision made in Qingdao. In the afternoon of the same day, the provincial government ordered various agencies to comply. The various agencies immediately issued a notice, saying, "Regarding the matter of issuing a notice, this case is based on the provincial government's Order No. 314, which opened for even matters. It was found that the members of this committee discussed the case of the Central Government's anti-rebellion army in the temporary discussion meeting on August 16. On August 15th, the provincial government moved back to Jinan to discuss the case of the retention and dismissal of officials from various departments. (1) All officials from various departments under the former provincial government who had been appointed by the rebel army were dismissed, and each department should notify each other not to employ them. Those who are confirmed to have acted in collusion with the enemy will be handled separately according to law. (2) After the provincial government returns to Jinan, all officials from various departments will be suspended from their duties and await re-appointment." After receiving this order, the officials of various agencies suddenly felt like a bolt from the blue and moved out one after another, crying like Chu prisoners. Only the secretary director Wang Ziyu was left among the old officials of the Education Department, and the rest had been appointed by the Jin faction and were all dismissed. At 9:00 am today, the provincial committees held another discussion meeting and decided that various agencies would officially start work from the 22nd. The provincial government's standing committee also decided to officially meet on this day. On the surface, the dismissal of officials would still be handled in accordance with the old case, but in fact, it could not be done. The files of the Finance Department are the most complicated, and some officials have served for more than 20 years and are very familiar with the files. If new people are suddenly replaced, it will be impossible to handle them. The various departments of Construction, Agriculture, and Mining have many specialized talents. If the old people are not employed at all, there is no place to find them in a hurry. The various agencies will inevitably stop working. Therefore, the results of the various committees' meetings decided to handle the matters according to the circumstances. In general, officials above the section chief and secretary level will be suspended unless they are forced to be appointed. Those below the section chief level who are purely appointed by the Jin faction for livelihood reasons will be treated with leniency and will still be selected for employment. Those who intentionally ingratiate themselves with the Jin faction will be punished separately as a warning. It seems that there is a lot of flexibility in this approach, but the financial situation is very difficult. According to Yuan Jiapu, the director of the Finance Department, the finances of this province were organized in the 18th year, and the budget for the 19th year has been balanced (revenues and expenditures each exceeding 28 million yuan). Unfortunately, this province has suffered greatly from the war and has been plundered by the Jin faction, reaching the point where the people are poor and the finances are exhausted. There is no way to grasp what the future holds. He intends to use the newly set 19th-year budget as the principle, and appropriately reduce expenditures to maintain the current situation. Apart from this, there is no other way. After the provincial government moved to Qingdao, the temporary budget was set at more than 50,000 yuan per month (including various departments). In terms of income, the cattle tax was more than 70,000 yuan, and the crab tax from Rizhao and Jimo counties was 20,000 yuan, totaling more than 90,000 yuan. After deducting the one-month expenses for July and the half-month expenses for August, there are more than 10,000 yuan left after arriving in Jinan. The monthly military pay for the two security brigades, one guard brigade, and one security regiment of the provincial government, as well as the Shandong bandit suppression post-war expenses of the general reserve team headquarters of the anti-rebellion army, totaled more than 410,000 yuan. The full amount for July and August has been paid, and not a single cent is owed, which was advanced by the various counties (August 21).</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Western Fujian Flee to the Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication The communist bandits in Longyan and Yongding, with Peng Dehuai and Zhu De fleeing to Hunan and Jiangxi, also gathered and planned to flee to the Dongjiang River in Guangdong. In the first ten days of this month, about 4,000 to 5,000 communist bandits from Yan, Yong, Shanghang, and Liancheng gathered under the command of Zhang Dingcheng, calling themselves the Fifth Army of the Red Army. Zhang Zhang once led a thousand bandits with Zhu De to Jiangxi, and only 600 bandits returned to Yongding at the beginning of the month. Later, they went to Shanghang Longyan to discuss with Fu Bocui and Deng Zihui a plan to disturb the Dongjiang River. On the 11th, they arrived in Yongding and immediately commanded the bandits to flee to the Guangdong border, dividing into two teams. The forward team, led by Ruan Shan, consisted of about 2,000 to 3,000 people and departed from Hulei in Yongding. On the 12th, they arrived at Kuzhu. The rear team, consisting of about 2,000 people, was led by Deng Gangyi. Zhang personally supervised the team. On the 12th, Ruan Shan fought with the militia in Zhongkeng and fled to Xianghu Mountain in Pinghe that night. Deng's troops arrived at Xianghu on the morning of the 15th.</p>

<h3>Recent Panic in the North</h3>
<p>Bomb Explodes in a Prosperous and Bustling City</p>
<p>Decision Made to Intensify Martial Law Immediately</p>
<p>Secret Activities Discovered Near Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The landmine discovered at the No. 25 overpass between Tianjin North Warehouse on the Beimi Road has been detailed in yesterday's dispatch. At around 10 PM that night, a thunderous sound was suddenly heard in the Southern City area, shaking the roofs and tiles. The citizens, already disturbed by rumors and in a state of panic, upon hearing the sudden loud noise, suspected a major event and scattered in all directions. Businesses closed their doors one after another. The military, police, and constabulary were all mobilized to guard the intersections and block traffic, conducting extensive searches. Upon investigation, it was found that the loud noise originated from a pile of dirty soil (i.e., what Shanghainese call a garbage can) in the No. 29 Hutong of Dongxingli. There were signs of the surrounding walls being damaged by a bomb blast (this hutong is full of brothels). However, no one was injured. As a result, three suspects were captured and are being secretly interrogated at the Public Security Bureau. Their names are not being released. It is only known that all three are staying at Room 42 of the Zhongdong Inn on Dongma Road. Emblems, letters of appointment, and secret telegrams were found in their room. There is no doubt that they are involved in political activities. According to the investigation by the Special Service Team, the landmine on the Beining Road that day and the bomb at night were all premeditated plans to create a terrifying atmosphere. On the afternoon of the 19th, the military, police, and constabulary authorities held a joint meeting and decided to intensify martial law immediately. The area north of the Hai River will be guarded by the 83rd Regiment of the 10th Army, and the area south of the river will be guarded by the 30th Regiment of the 4th Army. Other areas, such as the New Three-No-Zone, Xikai, Guangkai, and outside the railway, will be jointly guarded by the Public Security Bureau and the Gendarmerie Headquarters. After 12 o'clock every night, anyone with suspicious behavior will be inspected, and traffic will be cut off after 1 AM until 5 AM the next morning. However, there are no longer any army troops stationed in the city. The aforementioned 30th and 83rd regiments have just been transferred back from the Tianjin-Pukou front line for replenishment. Furthermore, Yuan Qingzeng, commander of the garrison, issued a proclamation in accordance with the provisions of martial law, stating that anyone who spreads rumors to confuse the public, gathers crowds to incite disturbances, robs people and property, or disrupts order will be dealt with by military law. Assemblies, organizations, purchase of firearms, private possession of weapons, and printing of reactionary publications are prohibited. He concluded by saying that anyone who dares to violate these orders will be severely punished and will not be shown any leniency. The commander's words will be followed by the law.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another matter that is also a potential threat to the North. Recently, young people have frequently come to Tianjin to engage in secret activities, buying off scholars, bandits, and Red Spear Society members to take the opportunity to cause disturbances. Recently, various proclamations have been discovered in Nangong, Jizhou, and other counties. A secret agent of the Pinghan Railway North Section Guard Headquarters recently captured Wang Degong, who claimed to be a division commander, in Cizhou. He is a well-known leader of the local Red Spear Society. He confessed that his army is under the control of a certain Zhang, with Wang as the general commander. Wang buys off scholars and bandits and Red Spear Society members in the Jizhou and Nangong areas. Deputy Commander Liu buys off former Zhili-Lu Army remnants and bandits in the Cangzhou, Yanshan, and Qingyun areas. Deputy Commander Jiang recruits bandits in the Chahar and Suiyuan areas. Their organization is divided into seven routes. Lu, the commander of the third route, and the first division are lurking in the Shunde, Nanhe, Neiqiu, and Lincheng areas along the Pinghan Railway. The second division is in the Jiulongguan and Malingguan areas. The third division is in the Cheng'an, Yongnian, Handan, and Cixian areas (Wang Degong is the division commander of the third division). However, the names of the personnel in charge of each route are mostly unknown, and their locations are also erratic, etc. Taiyuan has now telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government to instruct the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of each county to instruct the village heads and deputies to strictly prevent and arrest them. A generous reward will be given upon successful capture, it is said. (August 20th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Recent Situation in Beidaihe</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Northeast Cultural Society members Shen Nengyi and Zou Xigu reported to the press the day before yesterday that Japanese news agencies are spreading rumors that Commander-in-Chief Zhang was in danger in Beidaihe. Similar rumors were also circulating in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. The Japanese are fabricating news like this. We immediately lodged a protest with the Japanese side and demanded strict suppression of these rumors. We have received many telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Zhang in Beidaihe and various other sources. Commander-in-Chief Zhang is in very good spirits in Beidaihe. The American Ford aircraft that came to visit a few days ago was flown to Beidaihe by the pilot on the 18th to see Commander-in-Chief Zhang. He will bring photos of Commander-in-Chief Zhang back to Shenyang within the next few days, it is said. According to reports, the pilot of the American Ford aircraft is the American Bliss, accompanied by Xu Shiying, the deputy commander of the Northeast Aviation Force. They each flew a plane from Shenyang on the morning of the 18th and arrived in Beidaihe at around 10 AM. They went to visit Zhang Xueliang. Zhang had just finished bathing, and his bathrobe was not yet removed. After greeting them, Zhang immediately said, "Please see, do I look like I have encountered an accident? I am as healthy as ever. Where do these rumors come from?" He then laughed loudly. He then wrote a long letter in his own hand and entrusted Bliss to deliver it to Rong Zhen, the director of the Border Defense Military Department, and Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the provincial government. The gist of the letter was that he was in excellent spirits here, exercised every morning, and had gained 85 pounds compared to two months ago. As soon as the train is running, he will return to Shenyang. Please don't worry. Bliss returned to Shenyang on the morning of the 19th, while Xu Shiying remained in Beidaihe and has not yet returned. Furthermore, Hao Gengsheng, the director of physical education at Northeast University, returned to Shenyang from Beidaihe the day before yesterday. He said that on the 13th in Beidaihe, he played tennis with Zhang Xueliang at the Zhang family's mansion. Hao and his wife, Ms. Gao Zizi, formed one team, while Zhang teamed up with Ms. Liang Peiyao. The score that day was six to five, with Hao's team winning. On the 15th, the two sides continued to play, and the result was seven to five, still with Hao's team winning. Hao left Beidaihe at 8 AM on the morning of the 16th to go to Tianjin and then return to Shenyang. Zhang Xueliang's younger brother, Xueceng, even personally went to the station to see him off. Since Hao only left Beidaihe on the morning of the 16th, the Japanese claim that an accident occurred on the 15th is undoubtedly a rumor. Zhang is in very good health and high spirits. He gets up very early every day, reads official documents, and then plays ball and swims, which has greatly improved his health compared to when he was in Shenyang. (August 20th)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Japanese Fishing Vessels Trespassing in Our Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining previously sent a dispatch to the seven coastal provinces of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong to investigate and report in detail on the facts of Japanese fishing boats trespassing and fishing within our country's territorial waters. Currently, all provinces except Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang have provided detailed replies. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Liaoning: On June 13th, 13 Japanese steamships were fishing beyond the boundary in the waters near the Xinmin area. Wang Jing, the bureau chief of Jin County, led the Sui and Liao Flying Dragon gunboats to pursue and capture the Japanese fishing boat Datong Maru. On July 19th, Sato used a petroleum engine fishing boat to fish south of Yangjia Daquan in the waters of Zhuanghe. He was caught and ordered to sign a pledge never to trespass again before being released. Countless other secretly trespassing Japanese ships could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>Hebei: In June, a Japanese electric trawler was fishing across the border in Linyu, damaging more than ten baskets of fishing hooks belonging to fishermen such as Guan Yun, resulting in significant losses. In addition, Japanese fishing boats expelled from the northeastern sea often secretly went to the Hebei sea to trespass and fish. After the provincial authorities took measures to stop them, Japanese fishing boats no longer came. It has not been possible to investigate other counties along the coast of the province that are often trespassed by Japanese fishing boats.</p>
<p>Jiangsu: Every year in mid-April (approximately the beginning of the third lunar month), Japanese fishing vessels, often more than twenty, regularly catch rice fish northwest of the Haijiao of Shengshan Island. By mid-October last year, seventeen or eighteen Japanese trawlers, such as the 85 Hakata Maru, were crisscrossing the area northeast of Huanao Mountain, at a depth of 30 to 38 fathoms, causing a sharp decrease in the fish population. The various Shanghai boats were greatly affected and had to move to the southeast of Sheshan Mountain and the northwest of Bird Mountain to fish. The Japanese boats followed them without any scruples.</p>
<p>Shandong: Japanese fishing boats occupy two bases for fishing in the Bohai and Yellow Seas: A. Qingdao; B. Dalian. In Dalian, there are more than 600 fishing boats, with names such as Heishan Maru, Nishimura Maru, Hayashima Maru, Donten Maru, and Gendoku Maru. In Qingdao, there are more than 100 fishing boats, with names such as Myogen Maru, Asahi Maru, Qingdao Maru, and Nimyo Maru. Every spring, when the fishing season is at its peak, fishing boats from both places appear in the Bohai and Yellow Seas. In recent years, as anti-Japanese sentiment has increased in various parts of our country, they have built several 5,000-ton transport ships specifically to protect their fishermen and transport fresh fish. Their scheming can be imagined. There are two Grade A fishing grounds along the coast of Shandong. One near Longkou has two habitats: one extends from 37 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to 52 minutes north latitude, and 119 degrees 40 minutes east longitude to 120 degrees 30 minutes east longitude; the other extends from 38 degrees 3 minutes north latitude to 39 degrees north latitude, and 118 degrees 10 minutes east longitude to 121 degrees 50 minutes east longitude. The one near Rizhao has one habitat, extending from 36 degrees 45 minutes north latitude to 35 degrees 20 minutes north latitude, and 119 degrees 45 minutes east longitude to 120 degrees 10 minutes east longitude. Every year in April and May, Japanese fishing boats go to both places to fish. Our coastal fishermen are unable to purchase modern fishing boats and can only use old-fashioned sailing boats to fish. The competition for profits, gains, and losses is self-evident. Looking at the reports from the four provinces, the encroachment of Japanese people on our country's fishing industry is truly a great loss to the national economy.</p>
<h3>No Result for Eastern Railway Telegraph Rights</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The dispute over the Eastern Railway telegraph rights, which began in June and July, has still made no progress in the current meeting. The three telegraph issues that the expert committee could not resolve, such as the amount of sovereignty fees, the amount of international connection fees, and the inspection of outbound telegrams, were decided by the expert committee to be handed over to the Railway Bureau to be forwarded to the board of directors for resolution. In order to shorten the meeting period, the expert committee began to discuss telephone issues during the board of directors' deliberation of the three matters. However, the Russian side insisted that the telephone issues could only be discussed after the telegraph issues were resolved, and that the telephone system must also be restored to its original state before discussions could begin. This is especially different from the Russian side's initial statement that they would only discuss asset issues. Therefore, the telegraph issue has not been discussed for a month, and the telephone issue has also been shelved. The Transportation Committee recently telegraphed Li Deyan to negotiate with the Chinese director of the Eastern Railway as soon as possible to find a solution. Yesterday, Li Deyan met with Li Shaokang, who said that the board of directors is in contact with the matter, and it is still difficult to predict the outcome. It is faintly heard that the Russian deputy director, Yemushanov, told the Chinese director that it would not be difficult to move the inspection of telegrams to after the telegrams are sent. The amount of international connection fees and sovereignty fees can also be negotiated to find a compromise. If the Chinese side does not persist in its prejudices, the Russian side will still find it difficult to agree. Based on this, the future of the meeting may be deadlocked for a long time.

<h3>Quick Letter from Wuhu</h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Consolidation Committee issued an order the day before yesterday, ordering all municipal and county executive and supervisory committees to stop their activities and wait for others to be sent to take over. Xie Yongcun has been sent to take over the Wuhu County Party Department, and County Magistrate Sun Gongming has been sent to take over the Municipal Party Department. The Municipal Party Department received the order yesterday.</p>
<p>In order to prevent the activities of reactionary factions, the Central Propaganda Department has sent Huang Geng to Wuhu to establish the Wuhu Postal and Telegraph Inspection Office. The military and government officials in Wuhu are also forming a Postal and Telegraph Inspection Office, consisting of the 6th District Bandit Suppression Command, the Municipal Administration Preparatory Office, the Public Security Bureau, and the County Government, for the sake of local security. The work will begin immediately.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Municipal Administration Preparatory Office created the "Sail Transport Rapeseed Public Welfare Donation" last year, which was originally of a temporary nature. The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly petitioned the provincial government to order its cancellation, but has not been approved. However, the various business guilds believe that since the Municipal Administration Office has already collected municipal administration donations and has funds, there is no need to collect rapeseed donations again. They are requesting the General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the provincial government again today, ordering the Wuhu Municipal Administration Office to exempt rapeseed donations in accordance with the original plan.</p>
<p>The 6th District Bandit Suppression Command believes that wounded officers and soldiers have contributed to the party and the country, but local thugs often seduce and collude with them, causing incidents that are detrimental to local security. Today, a proclamation was issued stating that anyone found to be colluding with wounded soldiers to cause trouble will be severely punished according to military law. (August 24th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Water Police to Launch a Large-Scale Bandit Suppression Campaign: In the kidnapping case of the 23rd in Fengjing Chaonitan, the bandits numbered over 100, some carrying machine guns and all wearing gray cloth short shirts and trousers, resembling a military uniform. According to villagers, this group is part of the Taibao A Shu's band. They set out from Liujia Weir and other places and looted all the way through Qianxu, Luxiang, and Langxia. Their goal is to obtain both money and weapons. They intend to descend heavily on Taihu Lake and harass the various towns and villages bordering Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They are also buying off local hooligans and gangsters, spreading rumors to confuse the public. Those with some wealth are planning to move away, as if a great disaster is imminent. However, it is the time when farmland is waiting to be harvested, and there are reports of unrest everywhere. Local people are very worried. It is now learned that Fan Zhicheng, the captain of the Songjiang Provincial Public Security First Water Team, plans to launch a large-scale bandit suppression campaign. He has ordered Gong Guozhen, the squad leader of the Tinglin division, to be responsible for guarding the eastern route. Liu Zhigao, the squad leader of the Zhangyan division, is responsible for guarding Zhujing and the western Taihu Lake area. He himself will accompany Sun Zuomin, the inspector of the district, to mobilize the large number of ships to Fengjing to jointly suppress the bandits with Xu Pucheng of the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Second Water District.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Department Sends a Delegate to Investigate Agricultural Affairs: The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining recently announced that the various forms for the agricultural survey in the 19th year have been prepared and approved by the provincial government meeting. Agricultural surveyor Wu Wenlan has been appointed to carry out the survey in this county. Yesterday, an order from the provincial department was forwarded by the county government, instructing the district chiefs of each district to take good care of the surveyor upon his arrival.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Gold Case Fine Cleared and Dismissed: It has now been learned that Chuanchuan Pinzhu, the chief of the Public Security Seventh Branch, was accused by a certain Zhang of embezzling the fine in the Jin Yuting tobacco case during his tenure as chief of the Second Branch. The county commissioner Lu Mengchen and the bureau commissioner Peng Zhaoxin investigated and found the accusation unsubstantiated. It is claimed that the case occurred on June 16th and was reported for investigation by the Gaoqiao police station. After Jin learned of the case, he entrusted someone to voluntarily go to the hospital to quit smoking and donated 120 yuan to the police station for summer yellow uniforms and repairs to the Gaoqiao police station. When the money was delivered, it coincided with the change of chiefs between the two branches, so the former chief transferred it to the new chief and noted it in the handover book, which was presented to the authorities for approval. The procedures were complete, and there was no embezzlement or fraud.</p>
<p>Change of Education District: The educational districts in this county were originally divided into four based on the rivers in each township. However, this has caused obstacles with the autonomous regions, so the bureau plans to re-divide the districts starting this year, with Districts 1 and 5 as the first education district, Districts 2 and 3 as the second education district, Districts 4 and 6 as the third education district, and Districts 7 and 8 as the fourth education district.</p>
<p>Husband Catches Wife in Adultery, Father-in-Law Falsely Accuses Son-in-Law of Injury: Gu Yinhuo, a farmer from Zhengyi No. 14 in Zhuanghang, was adopted by Lu San of the same area as his son since childhood and renamed Lu Qiusheng. He was then married to Lu San's daughter, Bao Yun, whose promiscuity was well known. This time, Qiusheng happened to return from farming and passed by the home of his neighbor, Gu San, when he suddenly saw his wife having an affair. He was immediately enraged and summoned three relatives and friends to capture the adulterer. However, the adulterer's brother, Gu Guitang, gathered a crowd to intercept them on the way, so in the end, they only managed to seize his wife. They reported the matter to the chief of the Public Security Eighth Branch. Unexpectedly, Lu San did not take heed of the incident but instead blamed Qiusheng for interfering. He faked an injury and attempted to falsely accuse him. Fortunately, the county government investigated and found that the case involved adultery, so it ordered the adulterer Gu Asi to be arrested and dealt with. It is now learned that the Public Security Bureau arrested the adulterer yesterday and sent him to the county for investigation. The allegations by the gentry Ruan Lintang and others that the budget for the Nantang River project in Nanqiao exceeded the original estimate and that the project has no value, and that they are still collecting river taxes, have been submitted to the provincial government for investigation by Zhou Jiuxu, the director of the Construction Bureau. The original Nanqiao Nantang River project budget audit committee will be convened for a public audit.</p>
<p>Initiation of a Joint Defense Conference of Five Counties: County Magistrate Shen Qing recently reported that because bandits are rampant, he initiated joint defense with Nan Hui, Jinshan, Shanghai, and Songjiang. The organization will be expanded to include a joint defense conference of five counties within the month. It is said that Shen County Magistrate has been designated to draft the most important points, which include joint investigation, recruitment of joint teams, and sharing of expenses.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Water Police Encircle Notorious Bandit: Taibao A Shu, a notorious bandit, has gathered hundreds of people and has been wreaking havoc in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The army and police have repeatedly searched and suppressed him, but because the bandits are wandering aimlessly, it has been impossible to eradicate them. Recently, these bandits dared to lead a crowd to cause trouble in Guojiawei and other places in Jinshan County, and killed the chief of the Public Security Branch and the district chief. It has now been learned that after the water police division heard the news, it immediately reported to the Songjiang First Team Headquarters. The team reported the matter to the Minhang Shanghai Provincial Public Security Second District Headquarters by telephone. After hearing the news, District Chief Chen immediately summoned his troops and ordered the Jinghu warship to raise fire. District Chief Chen personally led his troops and the captain of the Jinghu warship, Jiang Xintian, to set out to Shenjing Chuanlai Temple the day before yesterday to carry out a severe suppression and dispatched warships to encircle them.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Judgment of Appeal of Robbery: Wu Dajinzi, a major bandit from Taihu Lake, robbed the Feihong Xiaolun, which was traveling between Suzhou and Chenmu, on April 20 of last year, and kidnapped two passengers surnamed Huang and Jin. He took them to Shanghai and hid them at No. 24 Ladu Road. Later, the detectives of the Public Security Third District, led by Xu Fengshan, led detectives to join forces with the French Concession police to break into the bandit den and arrest Wu Dajinzi, Shi Zixiang, Wang Si, and other 14 men and women. Liu Ziyun escaped and was later arrested by Xu and handed over to Gong Guoliang, the district chief, for questioning. The government presented it to the province to be shot on the spot. After Wu Dajinzi was shot, Liu Ziyun, who had escaped, was arrested by the Shanghai police and escorted back to Wu County. He was sentenced to imprisonment on June 16 of this year. Liu appealed to the High Court, and Lin Dawen, the presiding judge of the First Criminal Tribunal, revoked the original sentence on the day before yesterday, and Liu Ziyun was sentenced to twelve years in prison for helping the bandits.</p>
<p>Water Police Strictly Prevent Lake Bandits Activities: According to recent information obtained by the Suzhou Water Public Security Third District, Taihu bandits, Liu Xueshi, Xiong Yaonan, Zhang Si, Wang Xiaoren, Wang Heshang, Xu Xiaoyou, Li Chaochun, and Zheng Youen, originally planned to occupy Wujiang with 500 people and invade Suzhou, and to contact the Haidao bandits in Bei Da An Gang. At the same time, 200 bandits from Zhangzhu Mountain, Yixing, will occupy Dongshan as a base. At the same time, the troops will destroy the traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai Road from Yangcheng Lake. These people were appointed by Zhou Fengqi as Mao Zilong as the master, Wu Shaowu as the deputy master, and Zhong Zhaokui as the commander of the Taihu Independent Guerrilla Brigade. The bandits have now been defeated in advance by the water police and are no longer a threat. District Chief Gong is now strictly preventing the Taibao A Xu from harassing DianShan Lake from the Jinshan Pinghu area.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Two-Province Long-Distance Telephone Connection: The County Construction Bureau was recently instructed by the provincial government to connect the Zhenze telephone in the county to Nanxun in Zhejiang Province to facilitate news. After receiving the order, the bureau sent workers to erect telephone lines to connect with Nanxun, which has been completed and put into service. The telephone fee is set at one corner and five minutes each time from Zhen to Xun, with two-thirds of the fee going to Jiangsu and one-third to Zhejiang. From now on, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will become more convenient.</p>
<p>Provincial Public Security Team Enters the Lake to Suppress Bandits: According to reports from the Provincial Water Public Security Team stationed in the county, there are bandits gathering in Taihu Lake. Last night (the 23rd), Squadron Commander Huai Runqing personally led the entire team of patrol boats to enter Taihu Lake to destroy the bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Sericulture Case Villagers Plead at Night: The Huinong Sericulture Manufacturing Plant outside the Guangfu Gate of Xiyi Huinong Bridge has not yet applied for registration with the Department of Agriculture and Mining, but it has manufactured a large number of autumn silkworms, counterfeiting the Tiger Brand trademark of Dayou Seed Farm in an attempt to sell them. At the same time, it submitted a request to the Department of Agriculture and Mining to fraudulently apply for registration. The Department of Agriculture and Mining approved an order for the Sericulture Suppression Office stationed in Xiyi to investigate and respond for verification. Afterwards, Dayou Seed Farm learned that Huinong Sericulture Manufacturing Plant was counterfeiting its trademark and sued the department, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture and Mining immediately ordered the Sericulture Suppression Office to conduct a thorough investigation. The office sent personnel to confiscate a large number of privately manufactured autumn seeds (a total of 2,960 sheets worth more than 5,000 yuan) from the Huinong Sericulture Manufacturing Plant and sent them to the Xiyu cold storage in Guangqin District for temporary storage to prevent hatching. Afterwards, Chen Xiangchun, the manager of the Huinong Seed Plant, claimed that the silkworm seeds already had designated customers and that the time for raising silkworms was approaching, so he continued to fraudulently request the Department of Agriculture and Mining to approve the registration in order to openly sell the silkworm seeds. However, at about 1:00 a.m. yesterday, hundreds of villagers claiming to be buyers suddenly pleaded with the Suppression Office, demanding that the confiscated silkworm seeds be returned, but were unable to obtain a receipt. Duan Qishan, the director of the Sixth Division in charge of the area, immediately led police officers to suppress them and reported it to County Magistrate Pan and Public Security Bureau Director Xu. County Magistrate Pan and others immediately dispatched a company of police to suppress them and Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau also personally went to suppress them and persuaded the villagers to disperse and return home to await the official solution. It is reported that Deputy Director Yi Jianding of the Suppression Office has sent someone to the province to ask Director He for instructions on how to deal with the matter.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Comes to Xiyi to Secretly Investigate the Sun Case: Zhang Tong, Yang Chongyuan, and others in Xiyi previously claimed that former County Magistrate Sun Zuji did not make public the county and municipal funds he handled, and that he released a large number of prisoners on bail upon his departure. They submitted a report to the Provincial Government Civil Affairs Department, requesting that a delegate be sent to Xiyi for a thorough investigation. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government deemed that the allegations should be thoroughly investigated and sent a certain gentleman to Xiyi for investigation the day before yesterday. After arriving in Xiyi, the gentleman contacted County Magistrate Pan and Public Security Bureau Director Xu and reviewed the judicial files. It is said that he has found clues and will return to the province to report after staying for one or two days.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Notorious Bandit Zou Pigen Captured: Liu Yuanshan, a soldier in the Second Detachment of the Police Team stationed in Xixia, Wuyi, learned that the notorious bandit Zou Pigen was hiding in Yangtan Village, a village near Laogu Bridge in the northern township. On the evening of the 23rd, he personally led his troops and three patrol officers from the Public Security Fourth Branch to the address and arrested the criminal Zou. During the preliminary trial, Zou confessed that he was 21 years old and had joined the bandits last year. He repeatedly committed robberies and had two pistols, but he was unable to go out and commit crimes due to illness. The pistols were taken away by the bandit leader. Captain Liu immediately sent him to the city team headquarters on the 24th. He will be sent to the court for investigation in the next few days.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Apprehended at East Gate: Zhang Boyuan's home near Banzhang in the Sixth District of Wuyi was previously robbed and injured. On the 24th, Zhang Boyuan came to the city by boat from the countryside. On the way, he suddenly saw a passenger at the Dongzhiqiao area who was the same robber who had robbed him. The person saw Zhang Boyuan looking at him and showed a terrified expression. When the boat arrived at Changbu, the robber borrowed a companion to have lunch at a small restaurant in the east of the city. Zhang Boyuan immediately called the police and arrested him. He was escorted to the police team headquarters and then to the county court for questioning. The robber confessed his name as Wang Fengsheng and his companion as Chang Huanlin.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Merchants' Request: Jiangbei Bandits Impact Zhenjiang's Cloth, Silk, Piece Goods, Oil, Sesame, Sugar, Incense, and North-South Sundries Industries - The Four Trade Associations Jointly Telegraphed the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Yesterday</p>
<p>The telegram stated that the associations and their members have repeatedly reported that bandits in the Jiangbei region are rampant, causing merchants and travelers to hesitate, and severely impacting the city's finances. Zhenjiang's commerce relies heavily on wholesale from Jiangbei. During the annual autumn harvest, it is customary to collect payments. However, now Jiangbei bandits are taking advantage of the military unrest to disrupt the rear areas. The situation in Xinghua and Jianhu is particularly dire and spreading rapidly. The provincial forces suppressing bandits and police are already stretched thin. Some unscrupulous officials are even covering up the situation, leaving the people under bandit control feeling utterly hopeless. Furthermore, the members' debt collectors face numerous obstacles, trapped in towns and facing life-threatening dangers while traveling by boat or cart. Those who haven't been sent out are dissuaded by the news. Consequently, the debts owed to the various industries in Jiangbei are significantly affected. A thorough solution is necessary for relief, as this concerns the livelihoods of merchants and residents and the city's finances. Given the above situation, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we urgently request your association to telegraph the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office, urging them to quickly dispatch capable troops and shallow-water naval vessels to eliminate the banditry along the Jiangbei coast within the shortest possible time to provide relief. We are extremely anxious.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce's Response Regarding Rice Prices: The Suzhou People's Livelihood Office (Su Min Ting) previously noted that rice prices had fallen in various regions, but Zhenjiang's prices remained high, suggesting possible manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. It requested the Chamber of Commerce to conduct a thorough investigation. It is now reported that the Chamber of Commerce responded to the People's Livelihood Office, stating that Zhenjiang has never been a rice-producing area and usually relies on rice shipments from neighboring provinces. Changsha and Wuhu are the hubs for rice production, and the new rice has already entered the market, explaining the declining prices. In Zhenjiang, the new grain has not yet appeared on the market. However, recently, the high-quality white rice (gao bai tang) has fallen to around fifteen yuan per dan (a unit of dry measure), and the lowest quality has fallen to around eleven yuan per dan. Only the foreign Xian rice supply remains limited, keeping the price above twenty yuan per dan. It is expected that by early to mid-next month, when the new rice is fully on the market, the supply will be abundant, and rice prices will definitely decrease and not increase.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Demand Exorbitant Ransom: The kidnapping and assault case in Aozijie, in this city, resulted in the bandits sending letters yesterday (the 23rd), demanding a ransom of five thousand yuan for the kidnapped Chen girl and eight hundred yuan for the kidnapped Zhang boy. They also specified demands from over two hundred households and shops in the area, totaling thirty-two thousand seven hundred yuan, with a deadline of five days for negotiation at Beigushan in Jiangbei, or they would set fire to the area.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Gambling Temporarily Subsides: All the circumstances regarding the Fourth Branch Bureau of the Public Security Department at the Xiannv Temple in the county suppressing gambling and destroying the bureau due to a crowd gathering, and the resulting shopkeepers' strike due to arrests, have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the shops reopened today (the 23rd), and Chairman Guan of the Chamber of Commerce has come to the city to negotiate and mediate with the Public Security Bureau regarding the gambling offenders and those who caused the disturbances.</p>
<p>New Commissioner of Customs Appointed in Yang-You: The newly appointed Commissioner of Customs for Yang-You, Zhou Ziheng, arrived in Yangzhou on the evening of the 22nd and took office on the 23rd. It is rumored that there will be some internal staff changes.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Captured Notorious Bandit Killed While Trying to Escape: Since the county party headquarters began registering surrendered bandits, dozens of bandit leaders, including Fan Linsheng and Ding Laosi from the northern townships, have successively surrendered, willing to capture the remaining bandits to atone for their past crimes. The county party headquarters did not hold them accountable for their past actions and allowed them to perform meritorious service while still under punishment. Fan Linsheng and others discovered that notorious bandits Fan Diyi and Zhu Deqing were hiding near the Shanghai-Nanjing Road, and reported this to the county. The county commissioned Qu Lixi and requested them to go and apprehend them. Qu then dispatched Long Hua, two patrol officers from the Public Security Bureau, to assist in the arrest. On the 16th, they first went to Changzhou and Suzhou to investigate, but found nothing. On the 21st, they arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou and encountered bandits Fan and Zhu loitering at the Wuxi Railway Station. They were immediately apprehended and escorted back to the county government that night. According to their confession, bandits Dai Rushan and Cui Jincheng were hiding in the countryside, plotting wrongdoing. Qu immediately ordered them to act as informants and arrest them. That night, the two criminals Dai Rushan and Cui Jincheng were captured at Daijiatai outside the north gate. While escorting them to the county for trial, Fan Diyi and Zhu Deqing attempted to escape at Houjialong. They were immediately killed.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Xueyao Elementary School Burned Down: Yesterday, dozens of bandits suddenly arrived at Xuejia Yao in Zhentao and burned down the entire Complete Elementary School. They then went to the home of Xue Huanqing, a resident of the area, looted it completely, and shot and killed Xue's daughter-in-law and eldest grandson before scattering.</p>
<p>Police and Militia Capture a Large Number of Bandits: The county police stationed at Laohu Zhuang, based on a confidential report that bandits were gathering in the Zhangjia Zhuang area, immediately dispatched a team and captured Zhao Wenzai and eight others, who confessed to being bandits. They were all escorted to the brigade headquarters for interrogation. The Lang Zhuang militia of the First District, based on a confidential report that bandit leader Yang Xiaoshan and others were gathering at Shao Yixin's house, holding a meeting to discuss dividing land, arson, and murder, dispatched a team accompanied by informants and captured them. Bandit leader Feng Shaodang was killed on the spot, and fifteen others, including Wang Tieer, were captured alive. The militia headquarters received the news and immediately dispatched a team to escort them to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Kidnappers Escorted to Danyang for Trial: The case of the kidnapping of Zhang Hebao's son from Yangjia Zhuang in the western townships has been solved by the Zhenjiang County Government detectives at Taiping Mountain in Xinfeng. The victim has been rescued. The Zhenjiang County Government has dispatched police to escort the kidnappers, Sun Youcai and Zhu Guiyou, to Danyang for trial. The case was heard in court yesterday by Judge Guan and the suspects were shackled and imprisoned.</p>
<p>General Store Robbed in the Northern Townships: The general store opened by Zhang Laosi in Jiepai Village in the northern townships was suddenly invaded by six or seven bandits armed with guns on the morning of the day before yesterday. They twisted Laosi, extorted silver dollars, and then looted extensively before leaving with their loot.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Report on the Situation of Opposing the Operation of Automobiles in Jingjiang: The Director of the Construction Bureau, Mao Feng, following instructions from the Construction Department to investigate and report on the situation of automobiles operating from the riverside to the city in Jingjiang, submitted a report to the Construction Department yesterday, outlining the following reasons: (1) The fourteen-mile road from Baweigang to Tianhou Palace in Jiangjing Road is still weak, and the section from Tianhou Temple to Jingjiang City cannot be used for automobiles. Approximately 600 people travel back and forth daily. There were originally over a hundred small carts. After the operation of rickshaws (man-powered carriages) this spring, the cart pullers converted to rickshaws. There are currently fifty rickshaws and fifty small carts. After the automobiles began operating in July, the rickshaw and small cart business declined sharply. This is the reason for the opposition to the automobile operation. (2) The automobile operation is run by various government officials, and ordinary people who wished to add their shares to the venture could not. This is the second reason for the opposition. (3) The operators of the automobiles do not comply with the existing regulations. This is the third reason for the opposition. (4) The first company, Jitung Automobiles, prepared two automobiles and began trial operation without receiving approval from the department. This pursuit of profits led to similar actions. Sheng Zichun's third and Sheng Xiru's fourth automobiles successively began operating. It is said that other entrepreneurs will continue to follow suit. On the one hand, opposition is rising, and on the other hand, disputes are occurring. (5) The Jingjiang Laborers' Corps mentioned by Sun Kuisian has not been filed with the department, and local areas are not very familiar with it. (6) Currently, the Public Security and Construction Bureaus have jointly issued a notice ordering all vehicles to cease operation without obtaining a license from the department. This is a legitimate way to eliminate opposition and resolve disputes. Furthermore, from Jingjiang City, eighteen li north to Guangling, eighteen li west to Shengcitang, twelve li east to Gushan, and six li west from Baweigang to Luweigang are all important transportation routes. Among them, the routes to Guangling Town and Luweigang have many pedestrians. The existing roads are relatively wide and can be easily repaired and used for rickshaws and carts. This development will not only make transportation more convenient, but also adjust the livelihood of laborers. Selection and Appointment of District Chiefs: After the district chiefs of each district in the county were ordered by the department to go to the province for training, the vacancies were filled by the county government convening a District Chief Committee in accordance with the District Chief Selection Regulations. After review, twelve qualified candidates, including Gu Tongkai, were presented to the department for selection. The service areas of Li Dichens, Gu Tongkai, Liu Xinhu, Miao Jieshou, Liu Zaigeng, and Huang Baoquan were determined by the county and reported to the People's Livelihood Department for approval.</p>
<p>Juntai Pawnshop Sends Personnel to Investigate and Inventory Qingyang Branch: The Juntai Pawnshop in Qingyang, established in the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, has been in operation for 57 years. Recently, it has incurred debts of over 70,000 yuan to three silver firms and three money exchanges in Wuxi, including Baokang, Run Yongji, Run Ruichang, Run Ruiyu, Fuchang, and Shengyong Sheng, resulting in losses. Furthermore, internal and external employees colluded in fraudulent activities, making it impossible to salvage the situation. The Shanghai Pawnshop Owners' Association (Dian Dong Yi Fan Tang) has dispatched Zhao Libin, an accountant from the Sanxin Yarn Factory, to Cheng (Jiangyin) to Qingyang to investigate and inventory.</p>
<p>News of County Magistrate Li's Resignation: County Magistrate Li Lengwei, finding his duties difficult to handle, has reportedly submitted his resignation to the provincial authorities. It is rumored that the province is currently looking for a replacement, and there is talk of appointing Hong, the current secretary of the Construction Department of Zhejiang, to the position.</p>
<p>Fishermen Rescue Two Soldiers: The fishermen from the Huangshangang fishing boat, while crabbing near Changshan Island in the Yangtze River the night before last, heard cries for help from the reeds. They rowed over and rescued two people who appeared to be soldiers. When asked, they spoke in Cantonese, which was incomprehensible. They could not write. After repeated questioning, it was said that they were from Shantou, Guangdong, named Chen Jingjia and Ma Qingan. They were on a black warship and had an argument with their companions over a rice bowl, and three of them fell into the Yangtze River. One had already drowned. Later, local people sent them to the Yidu Bureau to arrange for their return to their hometown. Nephew Beats His Paternal Uncle to Death: Shi Quanyuan, a farmer from Wangjiatai and Shijatai in the Second District, had an argument with his nephew, Shi Hanchen, from Tangjiatai, at Yu Wenrong's teahouse on the day before yesterday, over a cloth shirt. Shi Hanchen kicked Shi Quanyuan in the lower abdomen, causing serious injury and death. The next day, the murderer was captured. Shi Hanchen had previously committed a banditry case and was released after sentencing. Yesterday (the 24th), his wife, Huang, reported the case to the county. Judge Yang will go to the village this morning to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<p>Militia Captures Bandits: The Zhouzhuang militia searched Luxiaorifeng Village the night before last (the 23rd) and captured Zhang Maoyun, Zhang Xibao, Zhang Wubao, Zhang Fuyun, Bian Shunrong, Zhou Rubao, and Fang Baocheng, who had already been convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes. All seven were escorted to the militia and will be sent to the county for trial today.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Six Counties Clear Bandits in Stages: After a defense and suppression meeting, Nantong, Rugao, Taixian, Haimen, Jingjiang, and Taixing in Jiangbei decided to completely eliminate all bandits within their respective territories. Since the police and militia forces of each county were insufficient, and the provincial security regiment was difficult to allocate, they divided the areas and proceeded in stages. On the 24th, the temporary bandit suppression commander, Li Changjiang, arrived in Nantong from Rugao, concentrated his troops, and joined the local police force to search and suppress the bandit areas.</p>
<p>County Government Sets Deadline for Each District to Procure Weapons for Self-Defense: The bandit atmosphere in each district of Nantong is unstable.</p>
<p>Previously, a county-wide defense conference decided that each district should procure 100 to 200 firearms within one month for effective self-defense. The deadline has now passed. The county government has set a deadline of three days for each district to submit the funds collected to the county in order to compile and present them to the province for the issuance of firearms to establish defense regiments.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Thugs from Causing Disturbances: Recently, there have been frequent incidents of thugs robbing and injuring people inside and outside the city. Around 10 p.m. on the 23rd, more than a dozen thugs caused trouble at the residences of singing girls in the southeast camp. The county government's Public Security Bureau and Guard Office are strictly investigating and prohibiting such activities.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Electrical Bureau Builds Provincial Electrical Grid: The Zhejiang Provincial Electrical Bureau considers the electrical industry to be a primary public utility that has a significant impact on people's lives and industrial production. Although there are hundreds of electrical operators in Zhejiang Province's counties, cities, and towns, most are small-scale organizations. Due to limitations in both capital and talent, the equipment is often poor, and electricity generation costs are too high, which means that electricity supply is not widespread. To support local private electrical industries and eliminate the above shortcomings, the Bureau plans to build a provincial electrical grid and purchase electricity from the grid. The Bureau will be responsible for all power generation and transmission projects in the province, while the sale of electricity will be contracted by electrical operators in various regions. The "Outline of the Zhejiang Provincial Electrical Bureau's Plan to Build an Electrical Grid" and "Measures for Zhejiang Provincial Electrical Operators to Purchase Electricity from the Electrical Grid" drafted by the Bureau have been submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and forwarded to the Central Construction Committee for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Hangchang Road Opens in Sections: The Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau is completing the construction of the Hangchang Highway in sections. The Huachong to Zaoxi section opened on September 1st. The Zaoxi to Qian section is scheduled to open on October 1st. The Yuqian to Changhua section is expected to open around November 15th. The opening ceremony will be held after the entire road is open.</p>
<p>County Bureau Chief Exam to be Held: The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that according to the County Organization Law, bureau chiefs such as the Education Bureau Chief, Finance Bureau Chief, and Construction Bureau Chief must pass an examination before being hired. As the establishment of county organizations in Zhejiang Province is approaching, it is necessary to hold the examination for bureau chiefs in advance. Therefore, a modified plan has been drafted and submitted for approval.</p>

<h3>Chinese Expedition</h3>
<p>Football Team Battles Bachen to a Draw Again</p>
<p>Two to Two...Twelfth Battle Report</p>
<p>(August 10, Batavi (Jakarta) Communication) After the Chinese Expedition Football Team lost to the Surabaya Selection Team, many believed that their 2-6 defeat to the Batavi Selection Team in the previous match was not due to a lack of strength but to bad luck. Therefore, many people requested the authorities to ask the two teams to play again to satisfy the public's desire. Today's (August 10) rematch has been realized.</p>
<h3>Initial Disadvantage Reduces Audience Turnout - Since the</h3>
<p>Expedition Team suffered a heavy defeat of two to six last time, although their triumphant return from Surabaya to re-compete with the Bachen team, they still failed to restore the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. Therefore, the audience on this day was significantly less than the previous time. The stands were mostly empty, and the standing area was not as crowded as before. It is said that the income was less than 10,000.</p>
<h3>Expedition Enters Field at 4:30 - At 4:30 p.m. on this day, the</h3>
<p>Expedition Team, led by Li Qiuguai, entered the field in high spirits. Although many players were ill or injured, they did not show fatigue. After entering the field, they tried out their legs and feet slightly. Then the Bachen team entered the field and also tried out their legs and feet slightly. At 4:40 p.m., Hong Junyuan, representing the Xinbasaha Flower Factory, presented a wreath to the captain of the Expedition Team. The referee, Mr. Boluo Hua, then blew the whistle to gather the teams. One saw</p>

<h3>Mayor Kicks Off, Two Sides Engage in Fierce Battle - After the two sides arranged their lineups, at 4:45 p.m., the order to attack was given.</h3>
<p>First, the Mayor of Bachen, Mr. Merlos, performed the kickoff ceremony, and then the fierce battle began. The center forward of the Bachen team received the ball and immediately led the army to attack, but was repelled by the defense line of the Chinese Expedition Team. The Chinese team counterattacked, passing the ball left and right, with a fierce momentum as if they were about to defeat the enemy before breakfast. Just three minutes into the battle (4:48 p.m.), the center back of the Bachen team, seeing that the enemy's momentum was fierce and difficult to resist, used illegal means and was penalized by the referee with a free kick. Although the route was good, the front line's charge was slow and ineffective. Then the Chinese Expedition Team returned with a vengeance, advancing from both sides. The Flying General repeatedly broke into the enemy's formation, and the opponent's gate was in danger. Within these ten minutes, the Bachen team was surrounded, and the water could not flow out. If the left side was blocked, it would come from the right. At 4:52 p.m., Li Qiuguai and Dai Center Forward coordinated and then broke through the formation alone. The opponent's goalkeeper came out to meet them. The ball touched Li Qiuguai and bounced inward, shooting at a slightly oblique angle and entering the net. After the players passed the ball out, the front line tried to counterattack, but was blocked by Little Black Coal and passed the ball to the front to score a goal.</p>
<h3>Gui Cheng and Yu Tian Play the First Merit - At 4:55</h3>
<p>Li Qiuguai received a ball from Little Black Coal and saw that the Flying General was in the best position and quickly passed it to the right. After the Flying General received it, he broke into the formation and went straight to the goal area. He slowly passed it inward, and Chen Yutian chased up and shot straight at the goal. The ball went into the net. The audience cheered and threw their hats, and the sound was like crazy drunkards. Then, in another battle, the Bachen team tried hard to counterattack in order to retaliate, attacking from the left and right and advancing from the front and rear.</p>
<h3>Zhou's Iron Gate Saves the Dangerous Ball with a Punch - At exactly 5 p.m., right</h3>
<p>winger An Nangde received reinforcements from the rear and went straight up along the side. He crossed the ball at a suitable point. The four forwards chased it together, and the left forward jumped up and headed the ball. The Iron Gate lifted his fist to save the danger. At 5:04 p.m., the Bachen team launched another attack. The left forward of the Chinese Expedition Team kicked the ball out of bounds by mistake and was penalized with a corner kick. No damage was done. Zhou's Iron Gate passed the ball out, and the forwards launched a large-scale counterattack. Li Qiuguai approached the goal and shot the ball on top of the goal, missing a good opportunity. During these ten minutes, the battle was intense, and both sides attacked and defended fiercely, so that the ball had no fixed direction. As soon as this side broke the encirclement, the other side was attacked by the enemy.</p>
<h3>Head and Feet Panic, Good Opportunity Missed - The battle reached 5:10</h3>
<p>At 11:00, the Bachen team's rear defense kicked the ball out of bounds, and a corner kick was awarded. The Flying General was the main kicker, and the landing point was excellent. The Dragon Gate was in chaos, rushing from east to west, but the ball still hovered in front of the Dragon Gate. You could use your head and I could use my feet, but no one could get in. It was really a pity. At 5:19, the Bachen team counterattacked, and the Chinese Expedition Team's defense was empty. Center forward Ya Weilin was able to drive straight in and shoot at the goal, but the ball went over the goal, missing another good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Gui Cheng Opens the Way, Lin Jing Receives the Success - At 5:20</h3>
<p>At 5:00, after Zhou's Iron Gate sent the ball out, General Cao broke through the formation along the side and attacked fiercely. He walked as fast as he could. The Bachen defenders could not catch up and went deep into the heart. Seeing that Center Forward Dai was chasing to a good point, he passed to the center. Center Forward Dai received it and forced the Dragon Gate to shoot hard at the corner of the gate. Ya Beituli could not rescue in time and it went into the net again. Applause continued to erupt. After that, the battle lasted only a few minutes, and the referee blew the whistle to end the first half. The Chinese Expedition Team was able to take a 2-0 lead.</p>
<h3>Seek Revenge, Bachen Team Attacks Fiercely - At 5:35</h3>
<p>The battle continued at the minute. Although the Bachen team had lost two goals, their anger was not quenched. They tried hard to take revenge and launched a large-scale attack with a burst of energy. The Chinese Expedition Team's defenders were busy defending, and dangerous balls frequently appeared in the Dragon Gate. Within these five minutes, the Bachen team surrounded them and were penalized with four corner kicks, but fortunately they did not lose any. At 5:43, after the Chinese Expedition Team broke the encirclement, Little Black Coal dribbled the ball alone and</p>
<p>counterattacked, charging through the formation like there was no one around. It was a pity that he did not succeed and only won a corner kick. After that, the Chinese Expedition Team launched another attack. General Cao was transferred to the right forward and drove straight in alone. At 5:45, he rushed into the Dragon Gate boundary and shot hard at the goal, but the ball was seized by the goalkeeper and failed to succeed. In the blink of an eye, the Chinese Expedition Team's rear defense was in a hurry again. The Bachen team connected on the left and right and went straight to the Dragon Gate.</p>
<h3>Iron Gate's Quick Hands Turn Danger into Safety - At 5:46</h3>
<p>Zhou's Iron Gate's quick hands and sharp eyes saved the ball and turned danger into safety. The Chinese Expedition Team counterattacked, and the five forwards passed and connected with each other very well.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Strength, Difficult to Achieve Miraculous Success - At 5:47</h3>
<p>Chen Yutian and Center Forward Dai passed to each other and were able to drive straight in, but it was a pity that they did not have enough strength and were caught up by the enemy, and failed to succeed. The Bachen team's goalkeeper passed the ball to the front, and the front line received the ball and counterattacked. Dabogong was not strong enough after his illness and could not cope as he wished, resulting in frequent dangerous balls. At 5:48, they were penalized with another corner kick, but fortunately no damage was done.</p>
<h3>Ball Monster Yutian Both Missed Good Opportunities - At 5:50</h3>
<p>Li Qiuguai dribbled the ball and counterattacked, approaching the Dragon Gate and shooting out of bounds again. At 5:53, Chen Yutian had the opportunity to shoot, but he delayed and turned it into a cake. After that, the battle between the two sides became more intense, and the charge and trap were very impressive.</p>
<h3>Corner Kicks Continue, Inevitably One Loss - At 6:01</h3>
<p>The Chinese Expedition Team was penalized with another corner kick. The landing was very good, but Dabogong was too calm and was snatched by the enemy's left forward first. Zhou's Iron Gate stepped forward to rescue, but the left forward jumped up and headed the ball into the net, and the corner kick was retaliated with a rescue. Then, in another battle, the Bachen team launched another attack. The Chinese Expedition Team's rear defense was not strong enough and struggled to cope.</p>
<h3>A Draw Was Finally Reached in Five Minutes - At 6:06</h3>
<p>The Chinese Expedition Team was penalized with another corner kick. The landing point was even better, and the left forward Fan Linan was not supervised and was headed into the net again. Therefore, a draw was created. After this draw, in order to seek the final victory, both sides attacked and defended fiercely, but due to the time limit, they were unable to achieve their wishes. At 6:15, the referee blew the whistle to end the game, and the result was a 2-2 draw.</p>
<h3>Rotary Cup Semi-Finals, Fourth Act</h3>
<p>China Wins the Finals Berth</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua Defeat Portugal in Two Battles</p>
<p>Will Compete Against England on the 29th</p>
<p>The Rotary Cup semi-finals in Shanghai ended yesterday. In the Portuguese singles, China won both matches, winning the finals spot with a score of 4-1. The final will be held against the United Kingdom starting on the 29th of this month to win the championship. A brief record of yesterday's two battles is as follows:</p>
<p>Six丨Two</p>
<p>(1) Qiu Feihai Six丨Zero Kanavaro</p>
<p>Six丨Zero</p>
<p>The Qiu-Kan battle started a little earlier. Qiu did not slack off from beginning to end. Kanavaro was able to play cautiously in the first set. However, Qiu's left and right shots were easy and sharp, and the old man ultimately failed, winning only two games. Qiu won the first set six to two. From the second set, Kanavaro showed his old strength and went crazy, but most of the balls flew outside the court or were thrown into the net, with very few successes. Qiu won two consecutive sets with six to zero and ended the game.</p>
<p>Six丨Three</p>
<p>(2) Lin Baohua Six丨Three Ke Lasha</p>
<p>Six丨Two</p>
<p>The Lin-Ke battle was not very exciting because the situation was relaxed and it was difficult to generate interest. Lin previously claimed that he had to hit three six-to-three scores with Ke Lasha, so that Ke Lasha could lose with dignity. The first two sets were indeed six to three, but at the end of the third set, Lin's balls were not powerful, but Ke was not competitive and could not return the ball, so he lost a game and the score was six to two, and the game ended.</p>
<p>The semi-finals have ended. The United Kingdom eliminated the United States, and Portugal was defeated by China. The two countries, China and the United Kingdom, entered the finals week and will continue the finals for four days from the 29th of this month to resolve this year's championship.</p>
<h3>China Participates in the Shanghai</h3>
<p>Grass Tennis Tournament</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Tennis Circles Reconcile</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Chinese and Western tennis circles broke up and reconciled, the interest in tennis became more intense. The Shanghai Open Doubles Championship organized by the Shanghai Sports Promotion Association has ended. The Rotary Cup is in progress, and the various competitions of the Shanghai Grass Tennis Club will also be launched in due course, such as the Robert Cup International Doubles Tournament, the Open Singles, and the Open Doubles. The Robert Cup is scheduled for September 5th, the doubles are scheduled for September 1st, and the battles are scheduled for September 15th. China has already participated in the Robert Cup. In addition, top players such as Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, Zheng Zhaojia, Jiang Daozhang, Yu Tianguang, and Liu Keng have also signed up to participate one after another. Once the competition starts, the French Chamber of Commerce will be lively again for a while.</p>
<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p>Men's and Women's Games are Unreasonable</p>
<p>Men are Strong and Women are Weak, Which Does Not Conform to the Principle of Promoting Sports: The National Sports Association Issues a Notice Rejecting the Borrowing of the Court: The Chinese National Sports Association issued a notice on the 26th, saying:</p>
<p>"In light of the fact that the physical structure of men and women is vastly different in strength and weakness, there is no possibility of confronting each other in a basketball game that is highly competitive. It is not allowed in women's physiology and does not conform to the original intention of sports promotion. Therefore, we hereby announce that we will reject any request to borrow the Chinese Basketball Hall to hold men's and women's games. We hope everyone will understand."</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Table Tennis Champion Wins</h3>
<p>Defeated Shanghai Jiande Team Last Night</p>
<p>Last night at 8 o'clock, the Hong Kong champion, Zhonghua Zhiqiang Table Tennis Team, competed against the Shanghai Jiande Association Table Tennis Team at the Jiande Association gymnasium on Fusheng Road. The event began with an opening speech by the liaison director, Mr. Lu Zhongqiu, followed by a report by Mr. Yu Binqi, who briefly stated that although the Hong Kong team's visit to Shanghai had been discussed with the National Federation in writing, it had not received the Federation's approval. Therefore, there were no adequate preparations for external engagements, and all matters could be addressed to Mr. Lu. Finally, the notary, Wu Maoqing, announced the match records, with Wang Weixi recording the following results:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Jiande Performance Wins</p>
<p>Chen Yinting, Li Chuanshu 1 | 3 Jiande</p>
<p>Mo Qinghuan, Zhou Jianwen 1 | 3 Jiande</p>
<p>Zeng Yingfu, Lu Xiulu 0 | 3 Jiande</p>
<p>Deng Yaopeng, Zhu Wenlin 0 | 3 Jiande</p>
<p>Huang Wuping, Lu Zhongqiu 1 | 3 Jiande</p>
<p>Brief Review of Skills: Chen Yinting is skilled in both attack and defense, but unfortunately, he is too old. Veteran Li Chuanshu is good at responding, but lost to Li due to insufficient strength. Zhou Jianwen, although relatively new to the table tennis world, is diligent in practice and determined to succeed, becoming a player for the Zhonghua team with a leap. His fast shots are indeed difficult for domestic players to counter. Lu Xiulu is one of the Zhonghua players and happened to face Shang Fengling, the captain of the Hong Kong team and captain of the Jiande team, which attracted much attention. In the end, Lu's skills and powerful shots prevailed, and although Zeng actively resisted, he was defeated by Lu's endless changes. Zhu Wenlin is a rising star in the table tennis world, suitable for both offense and defense, and thus achieved victory. Although Huang Wuping's skills are good, he lost to Lu Zhongqiu in a 1-3 defeat.</p>

<h3>Full Restoration of Shipping on the Upper Yangtze</h3>
<p>Chinese Steamships Also Begin Operations</p>
<p>Shipping on the upper Yangtze River, which had been disrupted by communist disturbances, has been fully restored as the communists in Gan and Xiang have recently been defeated. Commercial shipping has resumed. The latest news is as follows:</p>
<h3>Changsha Urges Immediate Shipment of Goods: Changsha Merchants in Distress</h3>
<p>When the communists entered Xiang, they ordered Shanghai to cease transporting goods. Recently, order has gradually been restored, and all goods are in short supply due to the commercial devastation. To meet the needs of supply, telegrams have been sent to Shanghai daily urging the shipment of general merchandise to Xiang in order to revitalize the market. Recently, textiles, cotton yarn, hardware, sundry goods, and white sugar have been continuously loaded and shipped. Foreign steamships such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Jiujiang are competing to transport these goods to Xiang, which are then transferred to ships in Hankou.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Assigns Scheduled Ships:</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's upper Yangtze River ships have been suspended for a long time. Now that the "Kuaile" (Happy Profit) ship has been returned and repaired, the bureau has decided to take advantage of the congestion of goods going to Hunan and the lifting of the ban on Hunan rice to resume shipping on the upper Yangtze River. The "Kuaile" ship will be dispatched directly and will only stop at Hankou and Shashi along the way. This resumption of service is effective from today.</p>
<h3>Foreign Marines Return to Shanghai:</h3>
<p>During the emergency in Changsha, Britain dispatched a unit of marines to Hankou, and the Japanese Navy Ministry sent three more destroyers to the upper reaches. Now that the overall situation has stabilized, the British troops have been withdrawn to Shanghai first. The "Yanagi" and "Kashi" destroyers dispatched by Japan have also been ordered to return to Shanghai and are expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Companies Add New Ships:</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company is adding two new ships to the upper Yangtze line, named "Hongli" (Great Profit) and "Hongzhen" (Great Fortune), each with a net tonnage of 700 tons. In order to start service on the Xiangyi line as soon as possible, the factory has been ordered to expedite construction and complete it by October. Jardine Matheson's "Baohe" ship is also being rushed to install cabins and will be ready to sail next month. Taikoo's second new ship, "Wuxue", will also be able to come to Shanghai in mid-October.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Leader</h3>
<h3>Discusses the Grain Situation</h3>
<p>Price Trends Expected to Decline</p>
<p>Special District Cheap Rice Distribution Center to Open Soon</p>
<p>As rice prices in the city continue to decline, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, believing that the grain issue is of great importance to the livelihood of ordinary people, visited Mr. Lu Wenlong, a leader in the rice industry, to inquire about future trends in rice prices. Mr. Lu provided a detailed account of the situation and the upcoming opening of the Special District Cheap Rice Distribution Center. His remarks are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Efforts to Suppress Rice Prices: A Month Ago, Rice Prices in This City Were Soaring</h3>
<p>A Month Ago, Rice Prices in This City Were Soaring. Not only were ordinary citizens unable to afford to cook, but even ordinary shops and factories were affected. At that time, the city's Social Affairs Bureau and various organizations tried various methods, first with investigations and then with price limits, but the results were not very effective. Finally, a centralized distribution method was used, in which the rice arriving daily at the Nanshi and Zhabei docks, where rice ships docked, was compiled and distributed by the Rice Dealers Association to various rice shops to prevent rice merchants from raising prices and manipulating the market, so that rice prices would not continue to rise. At the same time, I (Mr. Lu referring to himself) conducted a detailed investigation with the rice dealers and assured the Social Affairs Bureau that there would be no food panic in Shanghai within a month, and I also tried to order foreign rice as relief. This is a general outline of the past efforts to suppress rice prices.</p>
<h3>Good Harvests Everywhere This Year: The Import of Foreign Rice Is Not a Fundamental Solution.</h3>
<p>Good Harvests Everywhere This Year: The Import of Foreign Rice Is Not a Fundamental Solution. Even in Shanghai, the cost of importing foreign rice is more than 10 million yuan. Wouldn't it be heartbreaking to give so much money to others? Therefore, the fundamental solution must be a good domestic harvest. This year's rice-producing provinces have had excellent harvests. It is estimated that Hunan and Jiangxi provinces have both had 120% harvests. The rice production in Pudong has increased by 40% compared to previous years. Therefore, the price of Pudong rice was 21 yuan when the new grain came on the market and has now fallen to 18 yuan. Also, the area bordering Anhui and Nanjing, which is a producing area of indica rice, has also had a good harvest, with the price of rice falling from 16 yuan to 14 yuan. In short, based on the current situation, if there are no major storms or prolonged rain disasters within a month, this year's harvest will not only be 120%, but will also have 140%. It is foreseeable that rice prices will decline.</p>
<h3>Situation of Cheap Rice Distribution: The Efforts of the Authorities and Enthusiastic People in Society to Hold Cheap Rice Distribution.</h3>
<p>Situation of Cheap Rice Distribution: The Fundamentally Fall Of Rice Prices: Primarily attributed to this year's good harvest. In addition, authorities and enthusiastic people in society are making every effort to carry out the distribution of cheap rice which is also an important factor. As of now, ten cheap rice distribution centers have already been established. Recently, Mr. Yu Qiaqing also plans to raise 500,000 yuan to distribute 100,000 dan of cheap rice, with a planned loss of 5 yuan per dan. The implementation plan involves an appropriation of 250,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance, and 125,000 yuan each from the municipal government and the Public Works Department. Currently, 125,000 yuan from the Public Works Department and 50,000 yuan from the municipal government have been received, totaling 175,000 yuan. The first order of 1,500 tons of rice, or 15,000 dan, has arrived in Shanghai. 12,000 dan will be distributed to the existing cheap rice distribution centers, and the remaining 3,000 dan will be distributed in the leased territories and special districts. The planned location is within the Tianhou Temple, and the price will be set at 380 wen per sheng, totaling about 13 yuan per dan, which is about 2 yuan cheaper than the market price per dan. The method of the special district cheap rice distribution center will be slightly different from other cheap rice centers. Other centers only distribute 5 sheng per person, but the special district will increase it to 5 dou per person. The purpose is to help general small shops, small factories, and small-scale catering businesses. It is expected to be implemented this Thursday or Friday.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Cables for Arrest of Jiangbei Bandits</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Flexible Procedures for Members Leaving the Association</h3>
<p>Document Submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requests permission for flexible procedures regarding the withdrawal of fellow trade members from the association, to be decided by the executive committee and submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs. On the 23rd of this month, a letter was received from the Silk and Satin Trade Association stating that, according to the association's charter, members who wish to withdraw must submit a written statement of reasons and obtain the approval of more than half of the members at the general meeting. However, if a member wishes to withdraw after the general meeting has just closed, or if they cease business or engage in other industries, and the investigation proves this to be true, they should be allowed to withdraw. However, as a general meeting is not easy to convene at any given time, it is asked if the executive committee can exercise its authority on behalf of the general meeting and submit it for ratification when the general meeting convenes. As the charter does not specify any basis for this, the association anticipates that such situations are inevitable for any trade association. Therefore, at the association's extraordinary meeting on August 18th, it was resolved to request an interpretation from the higher authorities. The matter is hereby formally requested to your esteemed association for an interpretation so that there is a basis for compliance. Article 7 of the association's charter states that a member's withdrawal must be approved by more than half of the members at the general meeting, which is modeled after Article 14 of the association's charter, which states that withdrawal can only occur "after being approved by the general meeting." The association's request to change this to allow the executive committee to exercise its authority on behalf of the general meeting and submit it for ratification when the general meeting convenes is because the general meeting is limited to a scheduled time, and if flexible procedures are not adopted, those who request to withdraw for legitimate reasons will not be able to do so. This is indeed a practical situation, and it is proposed that the association be allowed to amend the above clauses in its charter and request its passage when the next general meeting is convened, so that there will be a basis for handling the matter. However, before the current charter is amended, it will be difficult to handle the matter. It is reasonably requested that your bureau first issue an instruction as a decision on the matter of members' withdrawal being decided by the executive committee and submitted to the general meeting for ratification, so that the association can notify all its affiliated associations to follow suit. When the various associations convene their next general meetings, this matter can be included in the charter to make it more thorough. As the matter involves amending the charter, it exceeds the scope of interpretation, and the association does not dare to act without authorization. Whether this is appropriate is humbly submitted for your review and guidance.</p>

<h3>Letter from Various Trade Unions in Pudong to Workers of Japanese Cotton Mills in the City</h3>
<p>Issued in Response to the Sino-Japanese Labor Dispute</p>
<p>Guomin News: The various trade unions in Pudong have jointly issued a letter to workers in Japanese cotton mills in the city regarding the Sino-Japanese labor dispute. This time, our various trade unions in Pudong specially convened a meeting of representatives of various trade unions for the Sino-Japanese cotton mill labor dispute. The significance of convening this meeting is to use our united strength to assist the Sino-Japanese workers in various ways to achieve the goal of victory. The Sino-Japanese labor dispute has been going on for five weeks now. Because of the cruelty of the Japanese, it has not yet been resolved. Speaking of the origin of the labor dispute, it is truly insignificant. First, the workers made three requests to the factory: (1) Increase the rice subsidy by one dime per person per day; (2) Stop Sunday night shifts in summer; (3) No punishment for short-term work stoppages. Regarding the first article, anyone who is not blind can admit that the price of rice has indeed increased. Asking for a rice subsidy is a common practice in all factories and is by no means unique to Sino-Japanese factories. Regarding the second item, asking to stop Sunday night shifts in the sweltering summer heat is something that anyone who knows the work of a cotton mill will admit is necessary. Regarding the third item, people are made of flesh and blood, not iron. People will always have temporary illnesses or other unforeseen events, so temporary work stoppages are inevitable. However, the factory doesn't care about anything and punishes workers for any reason. The workers' requests for improvement are also fully justified and not intentionally meant to cause trouble for the Japanese. The above matters were previously approved by our national party and government agencies. Who knew that the hearts of the Japanese capitalists would be as hard as iron stones and their brains like gourds, without empathy or reason, and they would not accept them at all. One party used a small number of worker traitors and running dogs to deceive the workers. The workers could no longer bear it and had to go on strike. After the strike, the Japanese still did not realize their mistake and felt that their losses were too great, so they repeatedly wanted to start work unconditionally. The factory posted notices several times, but none of the workers went to work. Although the Japanese are thick-skinned, how can they compare to the pride of the Chinese? The Japanese took advantage of this incident to unreasonably fire seven loyal workers, saying that they were the main figures who incited the strike, which further increased the anger of all the Sino-Japanese workers. Now, the attitude of the workers is extremely calm, and everyone is thinking of giving the Japanese a lesson this time, holding the determination to fight. At the same time, our various trade unions in Pudong, seeing that the Sino-Japanese workers nearby are suffering such humiliation, naturally hold enthusiastic sympathy. We dare to say that if the Sino-Japanese workers do not win victory one day, we will do our best to help them even if we have no food to eat or clothes to wear. Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but our determination to defeat the cruel Japanese capitalists will not stop for a single second. This is our attitude and determination. What are you, the workers of the Japanese cotton mills in the city, planning to do? You are suffering under the tyranny of the Japanese capitalists, just like the Sino-Japanese workers. You are all Chinese! Can you really be indifferent to the Sino-Japanese workers? You must understand that if the Chinese workers of all the Japanese cotton mills in the city unite together, the power will be amazing. If you unite and help the Sino-Japanese workers, then even the cunning Japanese will sweat and bleed white blood. We hope that you will do your best to show your support in various ways, so that the victory of the Sino-Japanese workers can be assured. The victory of the Sino-Japanese workers is also the victory of all the workers of the Japanese cotton mills in the city! Comrades, be excited! Work hard! We are willing to stand on the same front and fight to the death with the Japanese under the leadership of the Kuomintang!</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Training Patrol Leaders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau considers patrol leaders to be the people who actually carry out duties and are responsible for supervising and directing the patrol police. On the one hand, they must also be role models. The quality of their competence is sufficient to affect the city's police administration. Most of the patrol leaders in this city are promoted from patrol police. The education of patrol police in the past was incomplete, so the competence of patrol leaders is very low. To remedy this situation, the police class taught at the training center has been temporarily suspended, and a long-term class has been established. Qualified patrol police are selected to engage in academic and technical training as a fundamental reform plan. It is reported that an order has been presented to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Red Tanned Leather Trade Asks for Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>Red tanned leather is a product that is very rarely produced domestically and is imported from Europe, America, and Nanyang. It is divided into three grades: high, medium, and low. High and medium grades come from Europe and America and are made by machines. The material is strong and tough, the color is bright, and the value is high. Low-grade goods are produced in Nanyang and are made purely by hand. The material is ordinary and the price is low. The artisans who make this leather are all overseas Chinese. It is estimated that there are forty to fifty leather factories in Singapore, Penang, and other places, employing no less than tens of thousands of workers. The raw cowhide material is produced in our country, shipped to Nanyang for processing, and then shipped back to the country. In recent years, domestic customs duties have increased, and the tax rate on low-grade goods from Nanyang is higher than that on high and medium-grade goods from Europe and America (omitted). The tax rate is too high, and sales have suddenly stagnated. As a result, leather factories in Nanyang have closed down one after another, and tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs and are displaced, a very tragic situation. Only a dozen or so leather factories remain, barely maintaining a lifeline. The Chinese Consul in Singapore, to maintain the livelihood of overseas Chinese, has telegraphed the National Government to request that the import of red tanned leather from Nanyang be assessed and taxed separately according to the value of the material and that the tax rate be reduced. Therefore, the red tanned leather trade in this port also sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday requesting it to petition the Ministry of Finance for a tax reduction. The trade also hopes for assistance from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Two Notices from the Bar Association</h3>
<p>Types of Stamps to be Affixed</p>
<p>Extension of Photo Certificates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association yesterday issued a notice to all members, which is transcribed below: (1) Dear Sirs, we have received an instruction from the Jiangsu High Court, which reads: "For compliance with the instruction, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has instructed to notify: in the matter of the Zhejiang Tax Bureau's report that this bureau previously submitted a request in April for instructions on how to affix stamps to lawyers' certificates, etc., we were instructed to check the telegram and found that the stamp duty for lawyers' certificates is two yuan, as stipulated in the lawyers' regulations. No stamp duty is required for the register. Membership certificates should be treated as membership cases of chambers of commerce, predetermining public fees. Contracts should be charged public fees according to the example of engagement contracts. Membership fees should be treated as receipts for money. Village and neighborhood committee members, if they are documents from local autonomous organizations, should be exempted from stamp duty. We hereby notify you of this instruction," etc. In response, we have already notified all sub-bureaus to comply. Now, we have received a reply from the Hangzhou Sub-bureau stating that the President of the Hangzhou County Bar Association, Bao Xiangling, sent a letter stating that the Hangzhou Tax Bureau instructed that lawyer membership certificates should be affixed with stamps, and some were missed. The Standing Council of our association discussed this matter and unanimously agreed that lawyers and prosecutors are the three major professions in the judiciary. When prosecutors exercise their functions in litigation with the people, such as issuing receipts, they do not affix stamps. This is to respect the dignity of exercising judicial power and is truly different from lawsuits and the operations of the people. The Lawyers' Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Justice of the National Government clearly stipulate that lawyers are performing duties, not merchants' business. Furthermore, the Zhejiang Provincial Government's 90th meeting in the 17th year of the Republic determined that lawyers are performing duties and are exempt from advertising donations. Based on this, it can be seen that merchants joining chambers of commerce and lawyers joining associations are fundamentally different. Furthermore, lawyers are appointed by parties as a litigation act, which is clearly stated in current laws and regulations. In civil litigation, lawyers' engagement and application fees are included in the litigation costs. In criminal cases, there are provisions for free defense, which cannot be compared to ordinary engagement contracts. As for the stamp duty for lawyers' certificates, it has always been paid to the ministry together with the certificate fee, so there should be no omissions. Moreover, the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty adopt a principle of listing items for which stamp duty should be affixed. The Central Political Conference decided that it has the nature of law, and according to the principle that orders cannot contradict laws, our association should not comply with the official letter. We hope that you will check and not feel grateful. The Hangzhou Sub-bureau stated that the case of lawyers was handled by your bureau instructing the Ministry of Finance to verify and order compliance. The association said that the order could not contradict the law and it was difficult to implement. We are now submitting a document for your review. Based on this, we have checked that the "various items" mentioned in the stamp duty regulations broadly stipulate that all receipts for money should be affixed with stamps, and do not specifically refer to receipts for money from merchants' business. When a lawyer is entrusted by a party to perform duties and obtains public fees, it is the same as the salary obtained by a public official, both of which are compensation. Salary receipts are affixed with stamps according to various receipts for money. Since lawyers are compared to prosecutors, the receipts for public fees and membership fees they issue should also be affixed with stamps. As for contracts for parties to engage lawyers to appear in court, the parties who sign the contracts should affix stamps as usual. This share of stamp duty is not borne by the lawyers' side, and the Bar Association does not need to declare its dissent. The above contracts and receipts for public fees and membership fees should not be exempted from stamps. However, your instruction that lawyer membership certificates should be affixed with stamps is a case that was approved by the Chamber of Commerce. There are no provisions for the Chamber of Commerce's membership certificates being affixed with stamps, and it is said that orders cannot change the law. We propose that your ministry add an article on various membership certificates when revising the stamp duty law to avoid excuses. The above reasons for the contracts and receipts that should be affixed with stamps are also requested to be verified and replied to the Ministry of Justice to notify the courts to comply with them in order to maintain the tax administration. The above situation in the report is hereby ordered for compliance by all bar associations under your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>(2) Dear Sirs, we have received the Jiangsu High Court's Instruction No. 6307, stating: "For compliance with the order to submit supplementary photos, the deadline is extended for three months," etc. We have decided to forward it to all members after a meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee of this association. Please check and see if you have submitted supplementary photos (four photos if you are performing duties in a local court, and five photos if you are performing duties in three courts). Please submit them to the association together with your lawyer's certificate before October 20th of this year for forwarding. Late submissions will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Child Welfare Association Solicits News on Children's Suffering</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association is the only organization in China that comprehensively plans for the happiness of all children. Since its establishment, it has been proceeding with this purpose and perseverance. In view of the drastic changes in personnel and the turmoil in social order in recent years, there are many adults who are suffering from hardship, but children who are displaced and destitute are even more numerous.

Therefore, we are widely soliciting news on the suffering of children in various places. We sincerely hope to vigorously promote this news and work with caring people in the country to study ways to provide relief.

<h3>First District Water Police Conducts Consolidation</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Chen Zekuan of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Corps has convened a meeting of relevant agencies to consolidate the water police and has formulated seven plans that have been submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs for review. The Department of Civil Affairs has now instructed the district chief to thoroughly consolidate the force, eliminate long-standing malpractices, and strictly train the force to become an elite force. The proposed consolidation plan is generally feasible and is approved for trial implementation. However, the items of establishing a guerrilla team and adding guards to the district headquarters involve changing the organization and should be submitted to the provincial government for approval before further review. Furthermore, the addition of diesel boats and the installation of wireless telephones is indeed necessary, but it involves increasing local expenditures and should be discussed with the counties and reported for approval. The district has now been contacting Jinshan, Shanghai, and other counties under its jurisdiction to raise funds.</p>

<h3>Severe Banditry in Xingyang, Henan</h3>
<p>The Henan Relief Representative Office in Shanghai sent a letter stating: "Yesterday, my old friend Zhongchuan from Henan Province escaped from Xingyang and came to Shanghai. After exchanging greetings, we talked in detail about the banditry in Xingyang. I will record it haphazardly (the following is Zhongchuan's account): The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts in southern Xingyang are surrounded by mountains on three sides and have always been a place for bandits to roam. This spring, a large group of bandits occupied the northern part of Mixian County, bordering the seventh district of Xingyang, and then sneaked into Fanggu Village in the southern part of the sixth district with more than 3,000 bandits, occupying the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, burning and looting mercilessly. It is estimated that the southern part of Xingyang, forty miles north and south and fifty miles east and west, is entirely occupied by bandits. Most of the houses in more than 500 villages in the territory have been reduced to ashes. When the stationed army of the Li Brigade came to suppress the bandits and then retreated, they pushed the captured elderly and weak into the ravines and killed the disabled on the roads. The dead and wounded were everywhere, and blood and flesh filled the mountains. The remaining fire continued to burn for three days. After investigation, more than 15,400 people were kidnapped or injured and killed, and more than 9,600 houses were burned down. The loss of property and food is even more uncountable. Now, the markets are desolate, and there are few people. Corpses are exposed and no one collects them, and the ashes of the houses are left unrescued. Those who have been kidnapped have no money to redeem themselves, and those who remain have no home to return to. This is truly a strange disaster that has never happened before." At this point, the guest burst into tears.</p>

<h3>Huang Baiying Has Left Shanghai</h3>
<p>She took the Empress of Canada ship to Hong Kong this morning.</p>
<p>The people in Wanyi Lane have left and the building is empty.</p>
<p>Tong Damao also went to say goodbye yesterday.</p>
<p>Baiying claims to embrace a single life.</p>
<p>Huang Baiying left Shanghai this morning. She will first go to Hong Kong and then to Singapore. The rumor that she will return directly to Guangdong is not accurate. Baiying has intended to leave Shanghai since the criminal court's verdict in the Tong Sanmao incited suicide case. According to her, it is because her family has repeatedly sent letters urging her to return to Guangdong. However, the date for the start of the appeal is set for the tenth of next month, which is only two weeks away. Her hasty departure is also quite intriguing.</p>
<h3>Booking a Cabin Seat: Rumors of Huang Baiying Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Have been circulating for some time, but it was unexpected that she would leave before the appeal was decided. In recent days, her girlfriends have been busy preparing farewell dinners for her, and visitors to her residence in Wanyi Lane have been coming in droves day and night. Yesterday, Huang booked a cabin seat on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada ship directly to Hong Kong at the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road. This confirmed the rumors of her departure to the south.</p>
<h3>A Gloomy Room: Yesterday Was Baiying's Last Day in Shanghai Before Departing for Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The reporter visited around 8 PM. Upon arrival, the reporter found that the objects in the guest room were messy, lacking its past tidiness. The photo frames hanging on the walls were also removed. The gloomy room made one feel desolate. After a while, Huang Baiying walked down the stairs from upstairs and entered the room.</p>
<h3>Motivation for Leaving Shanghai: Huang's Face Was Fuller Than in Court</h3>
<p>And her attitude was lively, quite different from before. The reporter asked, "Ms., is it true that you are leaving Shanghai on the Empress of Canada tomorrow morning?" Baiying replied, "Yes, it is as you say. I am going to Hong Kong tomorrow morning." As she spoke, she showed a slight surprise, but her eyes darted around, as if telling people that she felt happy and comfortable. After taking a seat, she described her motivation for leaving Shanghai, saying that she had received repeated letters from her family urging her to return to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Not Talking About the Lawsuit: The Reporter Was About to Ask How She Would Handle Tong Sanmao's Appeal After Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>But as the doorbell rang, Tong Sanmao's elder brother, Damao, had already entered the room. Huang Baiying stood up when she saw him and invited him into the inner room. After a brief conversation, she continued to talk to the reporter, saying that after she left Shanghai, her lawsuit would be handled entirely by her lawyer and she did not want to say anything else.</p>
<h3>Going to France: Finally, the Reporter Asked What She Would Do After Arriving in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>To solve her future. Huang said that this matter should be reported to her</p>
<p>Parents' wishes will determine. However, in her heart she quite intends to study in France, and is particularly inclined to a single life. Therefore, it is difficult to say what her personal future will be for the time being. However, after leaving Shanghai, she may be able to relax a little. At this point, a porter from the China Travel Service came to move her luggage. Seeing that Huang Baiying was busy directing the servants, the reporter took his leave and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Continued Capture of Ling Runxiang</h3>
<p>Assassination Case Criminals</p>
<p>Brought to court for interrogation yesterday morning</p>
<p>Lu Ju has confessed to the murder</p>
<p>Ling's Concubine Describes the Shooting</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Requests Transfer</p>
<p>Ling Runxiang, a native of Panyu, Guangdong, resigned from his position as detective chief of the Hongkou Police Station and was reassigned as an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. His family lived in Hongkou. On the 28th of last month, at 11 PM, Ling was having dinner with his beloved concubine, Ms. Zhang, at No. 634 Dexing Lane, North Jiangxi Road. After dinner, he took his concubine out, and as soon as they reached the entrance of the lane, they were suddenly attacked by thugs who shot him in the head. He died on the spot and the murderer escaped. Recently, the detectives of the Municipal Public Security Bureau secretly went to the Guang Wu Stage Theatre and arrested seventeen wanted criminals for interrogation. Now, the Hongkou Police Station has reported that Lu Ju, a Cantonese man, is closely related to the Ling assassination case. Lu lives at No. 789 Shunqing Lane, North Shanxi Road. At 10 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Wei Jinfu, detective Feng Qi, He Chengrui, and other Western detectives went straight into Lu's room. Lu attempted to resist arrest but was bravely captured by detective Feng. A lotus-shaped pistol containing five live rounds was found under his pillow on the bed. In addition, a packet of six rounds of bullets was also seized. He was brought back to the police station for interrogation. It was learned that his accomplice, a Cantonese man named Feng Can, now lives at No. 175, Tian Road. They immediately went secretly to arrest Feng, as well as a woman named Ma Meirong and Wang Ayu. Yesterday morning, they were escorted together with the relatives of the deceased to the Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Feng Shide. According to Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, Lu and others are being prosecuted for murder under Articles 284, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code. After this case occurred, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested seventeen suspects. The bureau has now sent an officer to the court to request that Lu and others be transferred to the bureau for joint interrogation to determine the boundaries of jurisdiction. It is said that the incident occurred due to demands for gambling house fees, which led to the tragedy. It is said that the Cantonese vagrants in Shanghai have been given regular fees by the gambling houses. This time, Ling suddenly monopolized all the fees, so the vagrants got nothing. They hated Ling for cutting off their livelihoods, so they gathered their comrades and conspired to deal with him, vowing to eliminate Ling. Therefore, Ling was eventually assassinated. The pistol found in Lu Ju's house was the murder weapon, and Hu Ying, who is still at large, held this gun and shot Ling. The letters found in Feng Can's house also revealed a lot about the murder of Ling between the lines, and the woman Ma Meirong was Lu's mistress, and Wang Ayu was also involved with a certain man. The guns, bullets, and letters were submitted to the court, requesting that the case be postponed for further detailed investigation. Judge Feng then interrogated Lu Ju, who confessed that he had known Ling Runxiang for a long time. Since Ling monopolized all the gambling house expenses, causing everyone to be unable to withdraw money, everyone hated Ling. Therefore, Hu Ying gathered six people and decided to murder Ling, so they went together to carry out the assassination that night, but I did not go. The pistol found in my house was deposited by Hu Ying after the incident, and it was not mine, etc. I only learned of Ling's murder after reading the newspaper. The letter found in my house was written by my friend Li Bai. Li also had a share of the gambling house expenses. I don't know anything else, etc. Ma and Wang both claimed that they had not heard of the murder of Ling, and Ma also claimed that although she used to be involved with Lu, they had separated a long time ago. She had never seen the pistol in Lu's house. Then, Ling Zhang, the concubine of the deceased, said that she went out with her husband that night and suddenly heard a gunshot at the entrance of the lane, and her husband fell in response. She could still identify the person who fired the gun if she saw him. Then she chased out of the lane and saw several people running away together. Ling Junting, the cousin of the deceased, testified that my brother ordered me to buy cigarettes before leaving home. When I returned, I saw several strangers gathered in the lane, which was suspicious, so I told my brother to pay attention. Not long after, he was killed by those people. Finally, Qi Haitan, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requested that the defendants be transferred and said that Inspector Ling was under secret orders from the director on the night of the incident. Because he received an official document from the Guangdong Provincial Government that there were reactionaries coming to Shanghai from Guangdong, he was ordered to pay attention to the investigation. Unexpectedly, he was suddenly assassinated that night. The Public Security Bureau has already arrested seventeen suspects, so he requested that Lu and others be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be brought back for joint interrogation. Judge Feng then instructed that the four people including Lu had now been prosecuted by the police station, and that they should be sentenced after interrogation. He then ordered the defendants to be taken back to prison separately and the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>A Car Crashes Into Three Shops</h3>
<p>First Crashing a Rickshaw in the Middle of the Road</p>
<p>Then Destroying a Noodle Shop, a Snack Shop, and a Pharmacy</p>
<p>Automobile driver Zhao Derong, a native of Taizhou, is 23 years old and currently drives for Yongfeng Wood Company on the Bund. At about 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhao was driving the company's sedan-style car No. 1993 (Municipal No. 1797) near Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. Due to the driver's carelessness, he first crashed into the rickshaw of Zhang Yangyu (25 years old), a rickshaw puller from Gaoyou. Zhao knew that he had caused an accident and became flustered. He turned the steering wheel in an attempt to avoid it, but accidentally stepped on the accelerator. The car rushed forward wildly, instantly destroying the counter of the Chunyang Pavilion noodle shop No. 9, run by Zhu Shunxing (39 years old) from Hubei, and the tea and snacks of the Daoxiang Village snack shop No. 11, run by a local woman, Ji Pushi (45 years old), and all the medicines and storefront of the Zhonghe Pharmacy No. 13, run by Zheng Yikang (34 years old) from Fujian. Fortunately, no one was injured. The police officer at the Gaochang Temple substation of the Second District immediately saw the incident and arrested Zhao along with the car. After a brief interrogation at the substation, he immediately prepared a document and, together with the shop owners who were harmed, escorted Zhao to the Second District Headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>Woman Covered in Needle Marks</h3>
<p>Caused by a Barber's Gua Sha</p>
<p>But Died of Illness After Autopsy</p>
<p>In a house at No. 203 Guangxi Road, a Suzhou woman, Zhu Shunlin, was sent to Baolong Hospital by her family the day before yesterday due to illness. After the doctor's diagnosis, he could not determine her condition, but saw that she was covered in needle marks. He tentatively admitted her to the hospital for treatment. She suddenly passed away at 5 PM. The police station in charge was immediately notified (sent a detective to transport the body to the autopsy office on Feilun Road), and an investigation was launched. It was learned that the deceased was only 29 years old. She initially suffered from sha syndrome (a form of illness in traditional Chinese medicine). Her family invited Che Weikun, a barber from Suzhou who lived at No. 211 Jiangxi Road, to perform gua sha (a traditional Chinese medicine scraping technique). The needle marks on her body were caused by the gua sha. Because it was ineffective, she was sent to the hospital around 11 PM, but it was too late to save her. The barber was arrested and detained at the police station for one night. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court. According to Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, the barber is not being prosecuted under any law for the time being, until the cause of the woman's death has been determined. However, he requested that the barber be temporarily detained pending investigation. Judge Zhou interrogated Che Weikun, who confessed that the deceased was a prostitute and her family came to ask me to perform gua sha, so I went with them. After the first needle, the patient felt a little more comfortable, but then it worsened, so I gave her another needle and asked if she had taken anything. She said she had taken opium. Her death was not due to sha, but due to drug use. Judge Zhou then ordered Che Weikun to be temporarily detained. At 10:30 AM, Prosecutor Xu, along with medical examiners, went to the autopsy office for examination and summoned witnesses for questioning. It was decided that the practice of acupuncture is a medical specialty, and how could a barber rashly perform it? He almost ruined things. Che Weikun's needles were ordered to be confiscated. As Zhu Shunlin was determined to have died of illness, the family of the deceased, Luo Zhu, was ordered to sign a certificate to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Water Supply Negotiation in Jiuruli, Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Orders the Change to Tap Water</p>
<p>Jiuruli and Sanduoli in Yongxing Road, Zhabei, have a total of 167 houses with two artesian wells, which have been used for many years. Recently, the residents of the area, because of the insufficient amount and poor quality of the well water, jointly petitioned the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to order the owners to switch to tap water. The bureau sent someone to investigate and found that the faucets were less than one foot above the ground, and some were even lower than the ground. When the faucets were opened, the water either dripped or did not flow at all, and the water quality was also turbid. The bureau believes that with the hot summer requiring a lot of water, the quality of the artesian wells in the area is so poor that it is a great hindrance to public health. Therefore, it ordered the owner, Dachang Company, to switch to Zhabei tap water for use before the end of August, otherwise it will be forcibly implemented in accordance with the city's water supply regulations, and the cost will be offset by the rent collected from the residents.</p>

<h3>Superstitious Parents Send Son to His Death</h3>
<p>Zhou Xuegeng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 175 Fuyuli, Youheng Road, Hongkou, is in his forties. His wife, He, gave birth to five sons, four of whom have died. The couple are deeply superstitious and do not like to take medicine when they are sick, often saying that they have the protection of gods and ghosts who can turn misfortune into good fortune. Unexpectedly, his third-year-old fifth son, named Guan Gen (named after Guan Yu), suffered from diarrhea and cold limbs a few days ago. He immediately asked to see a spirit medium. According to the shaman, it was his father from a previous life causing trouble, and he needed to pray to resolve it (if he asked a doctor to push away the fright, there would be no danger). Unexpectedly, yesterday at dawn, Guan Gen's face turned yellow, his breathing became rapid, and his nostrils flared. Every time he asked someone to look at the ghost, he looked at the incense head and said, "You owe him 180 yuan in your previous life, so you have repeatedly reincarnated to collect the debt. There is no hope of survival. Quickly spread a large sieve on the ground and put the child in the sieve. After death, use a knife to chop the sieve into pieces, transport the clothes and utensils you wear and burn them, and put the body in a bamboo basket and throw it into the Huangpu River to prevent reincarnation." The couple banged their heads against the wall and cried. At dawn, relatives and friends gathered and accused them of not believing in ghosts and gods and putting their son to death. They urgently asked a Western doctor to give him a life-saving injection. According to the doctor, the disease was an epidemic and there was no danger to his life, but the internal organs had been damaged due to the delay, and it was too late to save him. Before long, he died of exhaustion. The child's parents still wanted to throw the body into the Huangpu River according to the shaman's nonsense, but after persuasion from relatives and friends, they bought a coffin and buried it in a public cemetery.</p>
<h3>Woman Imprisoned by Husband's Private Punishment Seeks Divorce</h3>
<p>A local young woman, Xu Xiuling (i.e., Zhang Xu's), has been repeatedly abused and beaten by her husband, Zhang Genlin, and her father-in-law, Zhang Songbao, and has filed lawsuits in the local court twice. Because the case involved a marital dispute and the young woman's injuries were not serious, the case was rejected and her husband was ordered not to abuse her again in the future. Unexpectedly, when she returned home from the hospital the next day, Zhang Genlin locked his wife, Xu Xiuling, in a room with huge shackles on her feet and did not allow her to eat. After the police station in the area found out, the patrol officer rescued Xu Xiuling. Zhang Genlin took the opportunity to escape and Zhang's father, Zhang Sanbao, was arrested and taken to the Seventh Sub-district of the Seventh District, and then transferred to the Third Sub-district of Zhabei for interrogation. Xu Xiuling was photographed in shackles and then sent to the Third Section before the shackles were removed. The document was transferred to the Procuratorate of the Local Court. After the interrogation by Prosecutor Li, Zhang Songbao was sentenced to detention pending investigation. Xu Xiuling was ordered to return and wait for instructions. It is now known that Xu Xiuling believes that she has met an unlucky man and has been repeatedly abused, making it difficult to live together. Therefore, she has hired lawyer Wang Hangu to file a divorce lawsuit in the Local Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei opened the Ninth Tribunal to hear the case. After the judge took the seat, he first ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to state the reasons for the lawsuit. Lawyer Wang stated that the plaintiff had been beaten and injured by the defendant Nanci, and the injuries had been verified by the Procuratorate of the court. Due to the marital relationship, the matter was leniently handled. Unexpectedly, the defendant became even more violent and locked the plaintiff in a room with huge shackles. Fortunately, the plaintiff was rescued by the police after being shackled for seventeen days. Moreover, she has been repeatedly beaten in the past. This situation is a complete break in affection. If she is forced to live together, there may be bad consequences in the future. Therefore, he requested the court to grant the divorce in order to preserve her life, etc. Xu Xiuling, the plaintiff, testified that she was 21 years old, a native of Shanghai, and lived in the Yinxiang District. Since she was a child, her parents and grandmother had insisted that she be engaged to the defendant. After she got married the year before last, she was beaten for no reason countless times. She also described the various hardships of being shackled and subjected to private punishment, etc. The defendant, Zhang Genlin, testified that he was 22 years old, a native of Shanghai, and lived in Huatingtou, Yinxiang District. Previously, because the plaintiff took clothes privately, the plaintiff's mother beat her. He did not want a divorce. The questioning officer obtained the statement and then suspended the criminal case file for review and ordered Shen Xiqing, an inspector, to come to the court to inspect Xu Xiuling's injuries. He also invited Prosecutor Zhao to come to the court to express his opinion. The defendant had repeatedly beaten the plaintiff twice, and this time he had shackled her, which was obviously a complete break in affection. He should be allowed to divorce according to the law, etc. Then the debate began. The questioning officer ordered the debate to end and scheduled the judgment to be announced at 10 AM on the 29th of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Mother Beating Son Case Fails to Determine Cause of Death</h3>
<p>Zhou Xingfa accused his wife, Zhou Yinbao, of abusing her biological son, Jishun, and after Jishun died, the police also filed a lawsuit pending verification of the body and further interrogation. The news has been reported in this newspaper. Now Zhou has transported the coffin from Nanhui to Shanghai and brought it to the autopsy office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor Xu Mei of the Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctors and other personnel, drove to the office and opened the coffin, but the body had been dead for many days and was severely decomposed, so it was impossible to check for any injuries on the surface. Therefore, an autopsy was performed, but the cause of death was not determined. Then, he ascended the public seat and summoned a group of people for interrogation, and then wrote an edict: "It was found that the deceased child, Chen Jishun, was said by the police to have been stabbed to death by his mother, Chen Yinbao, with a needle. The forensic doctor was ordered to perform an autopsy. Because the body was decomposed, the cause of death could not be determined. The case has been prosecuted and the original examining doctor of Baolong Hospital should be summoned to the case to prove that the body should be handed over to the father of the body to claim."</p>
<h3>Accusation of Rape of a Virgin, Repentance of Marriage</h3>
<p>Hearing Ended Yesterday, Judgment Pending</p>
<p>Wang Genbao, a Ningbo woman living upstairs at No. 231 Lafayette Road, French Concession, is 18 years old this year. She and her guardian, her biological mother, Wang Lu, 41 years old this year, hired lawyers Jin Yu and Li Yuan as representatives to accuse Gao Bingjiang, also known as Gao Xiqin, of rape of a virgin, breach of faith, insult, repentance of marriage, etc. in the criminal court of the French Concession. The original complaint of the plaintiff is now recorded below) The defendant seduced Genbao in March of the year before last. At that time, Genbao was only sixteen years old and immediately lost her virginity. When Genbao's guardian, her biological mother Lu, learned about it, she asked a friend, Chen Zhiqin, to intercede with the defendant, who was willing to marry Genbao as his wife. Because the defendant already had a legal wife, it was stated that she would be married as the main wife for two families. On the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, a gold ring and a full set of betrothal cards were sent, with his brother Gao Shunsheng signing his name. This is the custom of Ningbo for engagement. At that time, Lu also gave a reply, stating that the wedding date would be set later. Unexpectedly, not long after, the defendant moved the store elsewhere and asked someone to look for him to no avail. It was not until March of this year that he was found to have moved to No. 1022 Xihuade Road in the Public Concession. He was immediately asked about the marriage, and a dispute arose. He twisted his way to the police station and the defendant still admitted the marriage contract. After the case was resolved, the defendant denied the marriage and insulted Genbao by saying that she was a prostitute and admitted to having slept with her, etc. It was ruled that they should not quarrel on the road and each was fined. Afterwards, the plaintiff still asked the original matchmaker, but the defendant flatly refused. The defendant has already illegally raped a virgin and fraudulently engaged in marriage. This behavior violates Article 244 of the Criminal Code. Publicly insulting a virgin as a prostitute damages the lifelong personality of the woman and violates Article 257 of the Criminal Code. The defendant's methods are extremely cunning and bad. Now, Genbao's life has been defiled and delayed, and she cannot marry someone else. She is restricted by him and has no choice but to sue for justice and seek a solution through the law, requesting investigation and prosecution, and claiming private compensation for damages of 1,000 yuan, etc. The defendant was ordered to be arrested but did not appear in court. It was ordered that the defendant's proposal be opened for hearing yesterday. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the case and claimed that the defendant had committed a criminal offense by raping a woman under the age of sixteen and requested that he be severely punished to warn others not to do illegal things and requested compensation for private losses of reputation of 1,000 yuan. The defendant's lawyer also defended him, admitting that there was a love affair at the time, but he did not agree to marry her or issue a marriage certificate. Judge Zhu ordered the two sides to end the debate and listen to the scheduled judgment.</p>

A local woman, Shen Li, who lived near the Zhujiazhai area, proposed that Chen had a younger brother-in-law who had not yet married, and proposed that the younger brother-in-law marry the sister-in-law to form a family. However, Chen believed that her husband had just died recently and she was too busy mourning, and that the younger brother-in-law marrying the sister-in-law was a matter of reputation and she vowed to refuse. Li saw that Chen did not listen to her and twisted and beat her. Chen was weak after giving birth and her lower body was slightly injured. She called the police and brought the plaintiff and defendant to the Third District. After District Chief Xunming determined that Li had bad intentions and intended to profit from it, he sentenced her to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Having Defiled Her, He Sells Her Body</h3>
<p>Wang Er'a's Cruelty is Extreme</p>
<p>Li A'bao from Huzhou, his late father Wang A'kun, worked as a cook at Dingtai Sugar Store in the Sixteenth Settlement. In the middle of this month, Li's wife, Xie, 27 years old, came to Shanghai to visit her late father-in-law. She stayed in Shanghai, where Wang Er, a cook at Rongda Bowl Shop, often visited Wang A'kun, leading to idle chats with Xie and employing seductive tactics. The woman, of weak will, was thus seduced into adultery. Wang Er'a's methods were exceptionally cruel. After the adultery, he sold the woman to Taihesheng at No. 22 Sanyi Lane, Yangshupu, as a wife. Wang A'kun, because his daughter-in-law had run away, urgently wrote a letter to his son from a previous marriage, Li A'bao, asking him to come to Shanghai and entrust a detective to investigate. The truth was revealed yesterday, and Wang Er was arrested and taken to the First District Police Station for transfer to the Local Court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Calculating Usury, Resorting to Force</h3>
<p>Yan Hongzhang Enforces Collection by Coercion</p>
<p>Qin Changcai Suffers Internal Injuries</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a type of vagrant in this city who specializes in lending money at exorbitant interest rates to exploit the common people. The interest rates they charge are quite different from ordinary lenders, as they stipulate that for every dollar borrowed, ten cents of silver dollars are collected daily for a period of sixteen days. If the interest is lacking or the principal and interest cannot be repaid on time, they have methods to deal with it. They will immediately gather accomplices and resort to coercion. If there is any hesitation, they will be subjected to brutal beatings, hence the name "fist money." It is said that even a slight shortage results in a fist to the face. Those involved in economic relationships, even if they know the danger, once they try it and are unable to cope, they will be met with brutality, causing great harm. A man named Yan Hongzhang from Jingjiang, residing at No. 24 Diandang Lane in Nanshi, engages in this business while also selling fruit. Previously, Qin, brother of Qin Changwen from Haimen, who pulls rickshaws at Wuzhua Lane in Nanmatou, borrowed one dollar of fist money from Yan due to urgent needs. Yesterday was the deadline, and he had no way to repay it. Yan immediately gathered Li Wenshan and others to demand payment. Coincidentally, Qin's brother was out, so they coerced Qin Changwen in various ways. A disagreement arose, and a major conflict erupted. Qin Changwen was punched and kicked, resulting in internal injuries. He collapsed in extreme pain and lost consciousness. Ma Yunlong, the watchman of the 31st post in the area, heard the commotion and arrived, taking the group back to the relevant branch of the First District. Afterwards, the branch chief received an anonymous letter stating that Yan and others had a notorious record of wrongdoing and were pests of society, requesting severe punishment. As the matter concerned injury, he immediately prepared a document to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Mu A'bao Conceived Greed Upon Seeing Wealth</h3>
<p>For Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Several Knife Wounds Inflicted</p>
<p>Mu A'bao (also known as Mu Baolin) from Ningbo and Xu Rongming from Nanjing were both tea servers at the Xinji Shenzhuang in the French Concession's Hezong Lane. On the evening of the 22nd, Mu learned that there were more than three thousand yuan in cash in the accounting room and intended to steal it. However, Xu Rongming was sleeping in the accounting room, making it inconvenient to act. Mu then waited until the staff in the accounting room etc.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>returned home, hid a sharp knife and a rope in his clothing, and broke into the accounting room. He stabbed Xu violently several times all over his body, and blood flowed all over the floor. Xu, wounded, cried out for help. Mu panicked and fled without taking the cash. Afterwards, the establishment sent someone to report to the police station, which dispatched detectives to send Xu to Renji Hospital for treatment while tracking down the suspect for interrogation. Detectives from the French General Inspectorate learned that Mu was hiding in a certain house on Xiangua Street in Nanshi and, on the previous day, joined forces with detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to arrest Mu and extradite him to the French Concession Police Station. During the head detective's interrogation, Mu confessed that he acted out of greed and had no personal grudges with Xu. He was ordered to be detained pending transfer to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hawker Died Due to Insufficient Family Support</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoer, a native of Jiangbei, residing in a thatched shed attached to the Tongyi Silk Factory on Xie Xu Road in Xujiahui, Shanghai, was 25 years old. He worked as a hawker, was married, and had children who were all toddlers. The family of several depended entirely on Wang's profits from selling fruits and other food items. However, with the rising cost of living, rice was like pearls and firewood like cinnamon. The hawker's daily profit was meager and insufficient to support his wife and children. He was constantly criticized by his wife, which caused him to lack joy in life. He conceived a desire to end his life and, the previous night, in the middle of the night, while his wife and children were asleep, he hanged himself with a belt from a beam. By the time his wife discovered and untied him, he had already died. The police, upon learning of the incident, reported it to the Second District Police Station as a case involving human life. The station ordered a guarantor to report to the Local Court, which dispatched a prosecutor to the scene yesterday afternoon to conduct an inspection and ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Hooligans Demand Extortion, Resort to Violence</h3>
<p>Hu Wenhui Suffers Six Axe Wounds</p>
<p>Hu Wenhui, a local residing at No. 748 Xidexin Lane, Peng Road, Hongkou, who is over thirty years old, has been working as an inspector at the Dadong Dance Hall. Yesterday evening, around 7 PM, while playing mahjong at a friend's house at No. 147 in the same lane, three hooligans came, claiming that the homeowner was running a gambling den and demanded five yuan. The son of the second landlord invited them to the alleyway and agreed to give them three yuan, but his family was poor, and three yuan was not easily obtained. Wenhui then went out to appeal to the hooligans' boss, explaining the hardship and obtaining their exemption. He then returned to continue the game. The three hooligans, upon hearing this, were quite dissatisfied with Hu, considering him to have overstepped his bounds. After a short while, the three men, all armed with axes, broke into the house again and, without asking any questions, struck Wenhui with their axes six times. He received one axe wound on each of his arms, one on his finger, one on his back, one on his chest, and one on his head. The head wound was the most severe, cutting about an inch deep and exposing the skull, with blood flowing all over. However, Wenhui was young and strong. Despite his severe injuries, he managed to seize an axe from the hooligans. Seeing that their extortion attempt had failed, the perpetrators scattered and fled out the door. Hu was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, the hospital reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Station, which launched an investigation to apprehend the perpetrators and punish them.</p>
<h3>Boarding Master Assaults Female Worker</h3>
<p>Recently, in the vicinity of Shanghai West, the business of boarding masters who exclusively provide meals and lodging for female workers in yarn factories has been on the rise. Most of the female workers in these boarding establishments are recruited by the masters from various counties in Jiangbei. Each female worker is given a settlement fee of 30 yuan, with the understanding that they will work for three years. After bringing them to Shanghai, the master introduces the women to work in factories, and all wages earned each month are pocketed by the master. Furthermore, they are often treated very cruelly, leading to frequent disputes and quarrels between the masters and the women. Around 7 PM on the afternoon of the previous day, Zhu Mangkou, a 17-year-old woman from Taizhou, who resides at Chen Jinchu's boarding establishment at No. 96, Building 1, of Xihe Garment Factory on Robert Road in Shanghai West, has been working at the Xihe Yarn Factory. Because she has been abused by Chen recently and has been staying at Chen's boarding house for a long time, her wages have been swallowed up by Chen. The woman realized her predicament and decided to break away from Chen. Fortunately, female workers from the same factory saw the incident and alerted the police, who arrested both Chen and his wife and brought them back to the Sixth District Police Station. After District Chief Ren interrogated them separately, as the case involved forced female labor and assault, he immediately prepared a document to be transferred to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Dai Jinrong Beaten to Death by Coolie</h3>
<p>The Result of a Dispute Over Moving a Hemp Bag</p>
<p>Dai Jinrong, a coolie who carries cotton flowers at the Housheng Yarn Factory at No. 22 Lan Road, was carrying flower clothes on the bank of the factory's river at ten o'clock in the morning when someone on a sailing boat in the river placed two bags of cotton on the shore, obstructing Dai's passage. Dai asked Tao Fuxiang, the boatman, to take the bags back onto the boat, but Tao refused. A dispute ensued, which then escalated into violence. Chen Fukuan, Zhou Yushu, Ma Er, and Tao Fujin, all from the boat, stepped forward to help Tao beat Dai with a rain of fists, many of which hit vital points. Dai was immediately injured and killed. Pan Yulin, Zhang Yunjian, and other detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station went to the scene and arrested Tao and the other four, pending transfer to the court for interrogation. The body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, led a forensic doctor and others to the office to examine the body and determine the cause of death. According to the report of the Deputy Detective from the West, the five suspects stated that they were denying many aspects of the case, while the Chief Detective from the Police Station stated that he needed to prosecute the five suspects. Mr. Xu then questioned the wife of the deceased and, after further examination, ordered the body to be handed over to the wife of the deceased for burial, and the five suspects were to be prosecuted by the police station pending interrogation by the court.</p>
<h3>Accusation Against County Tax Collector Cheng Gentang</h3>
<p>Cheng Gentang, a tax collector of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, fabricated facts and misled his superiors, resulting in a joint petition from the heads and deputy heads of various townships in the First District to the First District Public Office, requesting that the county government dismiss him from his position and punish him as a warning against cunning. The original petition is transcribed below: The petition is regarding a cunning official fabricating charges, humbly requesting that the county government dismiss and punish him. Since we township heads have received the clear order to collect the overdue winter grain tax from the 18th year of the Republic, we have repeatedly urged payment and dared not neglect our duties. However, due to successive years of poor harvests and the continued increase in the cost of living, diligent work throughout the year is still not enough to fully meet the needs of supporting families. There are indeed many households in each township that are behind on payments, but they are all forced by circumstances and cannot be equated with those who deliberately resist. This summer, heaven was unkind again, and a sudden disaster struck, destroying almost all crops, making the livelihood of the common people even more difficult. At this time, if we were to drain the pond to catch all the fish, it is conceivable that they would take risks and face even greater difficulties in the future. We have jointly petitioned Your Excellency to request an extension of the deadline, so that the collection of taxes also includes an intention to appease. Such a method, we believe, is beneficial to both public and private interests. Unexpectedly, the tax collector Cheng Gentang, harboring suspicion of insufficient supply, fabricated accusations, claiming that we gathered crowds to resist the grain tax and begged the district chief to reason with us, which we ignored, and reported this to his superiors. We know that grain transport is an important source of revenue for the country, so how could we collude to resist it? If any of the allegations made by the official are true, then the law is in place and we cannot avoid punishment. However, if he fabricated the accusations, then it is a matter of slander and he should be punished in turn. Therefore, we humbly implore Your Excellency to request that the county government order the relevant authorities to swiftly dismiss and punish the official as a warning against cunning and to reassure the good and kind, which would be a meritorious act.</p>
<h3>Electric Shock Death at Tuberculosis Sanatorium Outlet</h3>
<p>Wu Tianfeng, who ran an outlet shop at No. 33 Bazilu Road, Shanghai Tuberculosis Sanatorium branch, sneaked into the X-ray room at 9 AM yesterday morning.

Someone entered and discovered the incident, reporting it to the Hongkou Police Station, which instructed detectives Shen Dehui and others to investigate. The report was true. The body was taken to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, visited the office to examine the body. According to the report of the Deputy Detective from the West, Wu Tianlong, the brother of the deceased, stated that the deceased was his brother and that the body could be handed over to him for collection. Prosecutor Xu then ordered the body to be handed over to Wu Tianlong, the brother of the deceased, for burial.</p>
<h3>Verification of Ma A'lai's Death by Robbery</h3>
<p>Ma A'lai, a native of Shaoxing who lived at No. 179 Guoging Road, Zhabei, and worked as a ash collector, went to the French Concession on the previous morning to collect outstanding accounts on the Pi Shao Nai Road.

They opened fire with a handgun, and a bullet hit Ma's right abdomen. The bandits took advantage of the situation to escape. Chen reported the incident to the police, who sent Ma to Renji Hospital. He died in the hospital at 3:00 PM due to his injuries. The hospital notified the police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang Forensic Examination Office to await verification. The relevant details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. In the morning, the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police Department summoned the deceased's wife, Ma Disi, and the witness, Chen Jifu, to the court. At 11:00 AM, Judge Zhu of the French Concession Court arrived at the office to verify the details and determine the cause of death. According to the Chief Detective's report, Judge Zhu questioned the deceased's wife and the witness. He then ordered that the examination confirmed that the deceased Ma A'lai had died from a gunshot wound sustained during his lifetime. Photographs should be taken, and the family of the deceased was permitted to collect the body for burial. The police were to apprehend the perpetrators for investigation.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>A (with his friend B in a restaurant after finishing their meal) — This waiter is so rude. I gave him half a dollar as a tip, and he didn't even say thank you.</p>
<p>B — If you didn't give him anything, see what he would do.</p>
<p>Waiter (hearing their conversation, turns around) — Sir, we have our rules. If the tip given by the guests is less than one dollar, we can only give a look of attention to indicate receipt. Only when we get a full dollar do we say thank you.</p>
<p>Mother — Child, are you fighting again? How did you lose two front teeth?</p>
<p>Child — Mother, I didn't lose them. I've wrapped them up and hidden them in the drawer.</p>
<p>Ship's Officer — Madam, I have instructed the waiters to serve you with special care. Why are you still dissatisfied? What exactly do you want?</p>
<p>Seasick Woman — I — I want a piece of land.</p>
<p>Procurement Officer — Is this horse any good?</p>

<p>Procurement Officer (after trying to ride it) — Damn it, damn it. You dare to deceive me. This horse can't run fast at all. You still call it a real warhorse?</p>
<p>Horse Trader — Why not? Soldiers should rather die than run away, shouldn't they? This horse would rather die than run too. That's why I say it's a real warhorse.</p>
<h3>My Observations on This Year's National Day</h3>
<p>— Shen Hengzhuang</p>
<p>A strong nation. Great citizens. Regarding the National Day of their motherland, they invariably make us clearly see their fervor and various forms of exciting revelry. The French celebration of their democratic anniversary is one such example.</p>
<p>But looking back at our China, for the great commemoration of National Day, aside from the rigid commemorative gatherings convened by the authorities, grand celebrations spontaneously organized by the people are simply non-existent. This cannot help but allow other strong nations to secretly laugh at our citizens' lack of national consciousness, and we ourselves cannot help but appear weak to the outside world.</p>
<p>Now, the great commemoration of National Day is about to arrive in an instant. If the citizens remain so indifferent, one ultimately feels a bit ashamed towards Mr. Sun Zhongshan, the founder of the nation. However, amidst this silent attitude, I heard exciting news, that is, for this year's National Day, many new figures in Shanghai's business circles and young people in social circles are preparing to unite and hold a grand celebration, preparing to compete with France and other strong nations. I heard the venue has already been booked at the Dahua Hotel. It is expected that on that day, there will surely be many enthusiastic individuals, taking advantage of the fervent mood, indulging under the sounds of music.</p>
<h3>A Tragedy of a Fatal Word</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Lu Xingkun, a doctor in Henghe, Yuyao, initially had no great reputation. In recent years, his medical practice has been thriving, and people from far and near have flocked to him. Every second, fifth, and eighth day of the month, he would go to Xiaoqiaotou for consultations, a place thirty miles from Henghe. One day in the late part of last month, Lu was invited to Guanhaiwei by someone surnamed Mou for a consultation. Upon returning, it was already late. Lu always took his own pedal boat. That day was no different. As the boat was traveling near the Taiping Bridge close to the Ganlu Temple, someone on the shore asked, "Is that boat carrying Dr. Lu?" The boatman replied, "Yes." The person said, "Then stop for a moment." Before the boatman could respond, the person on the shore had already jumped into the boat. There were three of them, each holding a handgun. They entered the boat and immediately searched Lu's bag, finding more than ten yuan, which they took. They also took the long gown Lu was wearing. Lu was angered and said to them, "Don't do this! I recognize you!" Upon hearing this, the robbers were both angry and alarmed. They immediately shot Lu, piercing his chest. The robbers ransacked everything in the boat and fled. The boatman was extremely frightened and could not make a sound. He wanted to take Lu home for treatment, but Lu died before they had gone half a mile. The boatman then reported to the authorities and told them what had happened. Alas! In ancient times, there was the saying "three words can make a rafter," but Lu lost his life with a single word. How unfortunate! However, robbers are all desperate criminals. They have forgotten their own lives, so how can they care about the lives of others? If Lu had been a little more patient and pretended to be deaf and dumb for a moment, how could he have lost his life to a bullet? As the saying goes, "The mouth can stir up trouble." This is truly not a false statement. It is said that the murderers have already been apprehended. This shows that robbery is both something that can and cannot be done.</p>
<h3>World Buddhist Academy Under Construction in India</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Letter to Master Taixu of the Wuchang Buddhist Academy: Revered Taixu, the earliest place where the Buddha transmitted the Dharma was formerly called Risipatana (i.e., Deer Park), now called Sarnath. The Manohara Vihara Temple being built here by your disciples will soon be completed. We hereby report this. Your disciples plan to complete it in October and intend to invite the King of Siam to hold the consecration ceremony. The construction of the World Buddhist Academy is only one aspect of it. We are deeply aware of this. Your disciples plan to invite students from various Buddhist countries around the world, as well as those who know Pali and Sanskrit, to come and study Buddhism. We hope you will provide us with a list of names and addresses of famous Chinese monks and scholars so that we can invite them to participate. If our master can come, we will set up a reception area for the master and a Chinese reception area. The chairman of our association, Dhammadharānanda, sends his regards. This is to inform you. We wish you all the best.</p>
<h3>China's Talking Pictures</h3>
<p>— Beigong</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was moved by the alluring advertisement of a cinema, which said "Premiering a domestically produced talking picture." I rushed to see it, but could not help but be disappointed. It was still a silent film, but with two live people repeating the words spoken by the actors in the film. This matter was truly ridiculous. It is said that at the time, the Film Censorship Board, because of its confusing intent, had sent a letter of warning. Now, it has indeed disappeared. But from this, I felt that the timely emergence of a real Chinese talking picture is a must.</p>
<p>Taking Shanghai as an example, the amount of Chinese money that flows out to foreign countries through foreign films is very, very large. Since the prevalence of talking pictures, the number has become even more alarming. Chinese people are simply amazed by its novelty and are accustomed to being fashionable, and they flock to it. However, I am afraid that very few people can clearly understand the conversations in foreign talking pictures. Even if we put aside the loss of money, in terms of the audience's enjoyment, it always feels like it is reduced a lot.</p>
<p>If China could create its own real talking pictures, there would be at least two benefits: First, take this opportunity to restore the Chinese people's faith in domestically produced films. Second, Chinese people will naturally find domestically produced talking pictures more intimate and enjoyable. Therefore, it could strike a blow to foreign talking pictures.</p>
<p>Not long ago, it was rumored that the Star Film Company had decided to create talking pictures. Each one has been tested and verified and has indeed achieved satisfactory results. It is definitely not a kind of speculation of a slippery nature. It is said that the first film has been named "Sing-Song Girl Red Peony." From this, it seems that a new glorious page has been added to the history of Chinese cinema. And the eight characters "Complete singing and dancing, complete dialogue" will no longer be the exclusive domain of foreign films.</p>
<p>Judging from the facts, this is indeed the best opportunity for the revival of our country's film industry. Then I hope that the Star Film Company will be particularly cautious and careful with this first talking picture. Because the future life of the declining film industry depends entirely on this talking picture. Come on! I also hope that the Star Film Company can publish the production process so that we can know some of their efforts and achievements.</p>
<h3>A Record of Qu Shangyu Cutting Flesh to Treat His Father</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shoushi</p>
<p>Cutting flesh [from one's body for medicine] is ignorant filial piety. Those with knowledge criticize it. However, in this world of turbulent seas, how many people can perform such ignorant acts of filial piety? Therefore, one cannot but praise Shangyu's filial piety and its ignorance. Shangyu, surnamed Qu, is a native of Haiwu. He is fond of learning and deep thinking and rarely speaks or smiles with others. He is fond of drinking. After getting drunk, he would talk about everything. He is truly a man of temperament. He is skilled in painting. He earns a living in Shanghai and has a very good reputation. His venerable father, Mr. Jingcai, is an experienced and respected man. He is the third child in his family. People respectfully call him Mr. San [Third Mr.]. He was working in the provincial capital and returned home early due to illness. Shangyu also rushed to his side, but Mr. San's illness was already critical. Shangyu was saddened and thought that there was no way to treat his father, so he imitated the act of cutting flesh. He hoped to move Heaven. Late at night, he dismissed everyone, set up an incense table, and prayed. After praying, he cut his arm with sharp scissors. There was a shivering sound. The wound was like a cup, and the blood was wet but did not flow. He rushed to the stove and threw the flesh into the pot. A cool breeze suddenly came. The fire in the stove flickered. As it was about to boil, the flesh suddenly leaped out. He threw it in again. It was like before. He threw it in a third time, and it finally stayed. Then he held the soup and went forward. At that time, Mr. San was still conscious. After drinking it, he felt something different. He sternly questioned him, and Shangyu finally told the truth. They cried together loudly. Two days later, Mr. San died. I have been friends with Shangyu for a long time and know his character well. His reason for doing this was to seek peace of mind. He did not know about filial piety, let alone whether his filial piety was ignorant or not. But the world will surely attribute filial piety to him. Is that what he wants? Mr. San's elder brother, named Yinzhou, was devastated upon hearing the news. The filial piety and fraternity of the family showed that Shangyu's inherent qualities had a source. Alas! It is all touching.</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Recent German Political Turmoil (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Liuzeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>The German political situation has gone from crisis to stability, and from stability back to crisis. The results of its changes often exceed people's expectations. Since Dietriech succeeded Moldenhauer as finance minister, we thought that Bruning's cabinet had a thicker power base and could stabilize things for a while. Unexpectedly, since last week, due to general affairs issues, the government and parliament went to extremes, holding each other for ten days without being able to compromise. Now, it is rumored that the government has dissolved the parliament.</p>
<p>Although the appearance of this incident is different from before, when viewed from the inside, it still has its consistency. The dispute between the government and parliament is always about financial issues. The dismissal of former Finance Minister Moldenhauer was because he wanted to impose a kind of sacrifice tax on the people. Now, Dietriech has encountered the same difficulties in parliament with the same issue. But this time, the cabinet's attitude is tough. Prime Minister Bruning has been fully authorized by President Hindenburg to overcome all difficulties in order to implement his policies. Thus, the parliament, which has always obstructed government policies, was finally dissolved. I will briefly explain the course of events.</p>
<p>Recently, due to insufficient national funds, the German government, on the recommendation of Finance Minister Dietriech, proposed to increase income tax and single tax by 5% in order to remedy the situation. However, this proposal was rejected by the parliamentary treasury committee on the 12th of this month by a vote of 15 to 13. At that time, the finance minister, seeing that the situation was unfavorable in the committee, declared that the original proposal would no longer be reviewed by the committee and would be submitted directly to parliament for a public vote.</p>
<p>After two days of verbal warfare, on the 16th, parliament again voted 256 to 204 to reject the government's proposal. However, on the same day, President Hindenburg had authorized cabinet prime minister Bruning to issue new tax bills by government order in accordance with Article 48 of the constitution when necessary, or even dissolve the parliament. Therefore, that evening, Prime Minister Bruning issued several orders, levying a 2.5% sacrifice tax on those with an annual salary income of more than 2,000 marks, a 5% supplementary income tax on those with an annual income of more than 8,000 marks, and a 10% single tax on unmarried men and women with an annual income of more than 2,640 marks.</p>
<p>After the government orders were issued, the Social Democratic Party immediately proposed a motion to repeal the government orders. The results of the vote on the 18th were that the motion to repeal the government orders was passed. Thus, the government had no way to go and had to announce the dissolution of parliament.</p>
<p>This time, Prime Minister Bruning resolutely dissolved parliament because he had the trust of President Hindenburg. Although this inevitably has the suspicion of dictatorship in politics, it was also a last resort. Because the cabinet had no possibility of uniting a majority in parliament, and the financial policy set was necessary for the present and future of Germany. Moreover, from the perspective of the German national position, the observation is the same as from the international position. Dissolving parliament and holding new elections may be better than cooperating with the right wing, which is entirely controlled by Hugenberg. (Before the parliamentary vote, Hugenberg contacted the government in his capacity as the leader of the right wing. Because the conditions he put forward were harsh and not accepted by the cabinet, he voted against it.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (262)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Gains a Jade Ring by Sowing Good Fortune? Only This Karma Inspires Songs of Golden Threads</p>
<p>After Channong was seated, Zuo Shichen said to her, "I didn't know you were out. It was only when Aba, who's with Zuo Cuiyun, mentioned it just now that I found out." Channong smiled faintly. Zuo Shichen felt very sad seeing her smile. The smile clearly didn't come from the heart, and it contained an indescribable bitterness. It was a kind of bitter smile. The two were silent for a while. Channong took the powder paper from the back of a small golden mirror and dabbed it on her nose. Then she said, "Second Young Master, we haven't seen each other for three or four years. How do you think I've aged? Tell me honestly." Zuo Shichen really wanted to say that she had indeed aged a lot. But looking at Channong's pitiful appearance, he had to make a disingenuous remark and said, "Not at all. You're still the same as before." Channong smiled sadly again and said, "Still the same as before? I know myself that I've aged a lot." Zuo Shichen didn't want to hear her continue, so he cut her off and said, "Look, I've aged quite a bit too." Channong said, "You don't look old at all. You're really the same as before. What does it matter if a man ages a little? When we women age, our lives are over." Zuo Shichen said, "Why did you come out again?" Channong said, "You've scattered here. Come to my business. This can't be explained in two or three sentences. Besides, it's not good to talk about it in this place now." Zuo Shichen said, "Today I'm being a host reluctantly. I'm afraid the party won't end early." Channong said, "Then come tomorrow. Come earlier tomorrow. If you want to talk about my affairs, it would take two or three hours. If you were to write a novel, it could be a thick book. Anyway, I have few performances now. Come to my place for supper. The place is in Baihuadi. Baihuadi is the only teahouse we have now." Zuo Shichen thought that he had indeed never been to Baihuadi. He once made a riddle. The riddle was a line of poetry: "When the last cherry blossoms fall, the spring is over." The answer was a place name in Shanghai: "Baihuadi" [Bottom of a Hundred Flowers]. Because of this riddle, he thought of Cuiyun's past years, truly like flowing water. It had reached the end of spring. The bright and colorful time was like a fleeting glance without a trace. She lived in Baihuadi. She really wanted to complain to the God of Spring about the lateness of twilight. Turning back to look at Channong, although she smiled with her head lowered, the wrinkles naturally appeared on her eyebrows and the corners of her eyes in the smile. It was no longer something that could be covered up by the power of rouge and powder. The twilight of middle age suddenly drilled into her blood and could no longer be cleared away. It was probably imaginable what kind of suffering she had endured in the three or four years since she got married. Because although she was a quiet girl, she used to have delicate and distant criticism. But now, it seemed that her lively mood had been gnawed away by the decadent environment.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Show a Reversal</h3>
<p>Strong Volatility with Seventeen Taels of Fluctuation Yesterday, the 25th, the price of gold suddenly weakened with extreme volatility, turning from sharp to sluggish. There was a fluctuation of seventeen taels throughout the day. The market atmosphere was chaotic, unpredictable, and turbulent again, causing instability. The trend reversed. Foreign exchange has already been reduced by two and a half notches, but the internal situation is tight and then loose, with different situations in the official and unofficial markets. Sellers dominated the market, opening high in the morning, almost reaching the seventy-tael mark, likely due to the continuous decline in large bars. Afterwards, sellers such as Yuanxing Yongyi Feng Yongfuchang Shunhe Wanxing enthusiastically promoted sales. Foreign speculators, seeing that the price of silver still had a potential to rebound, have inclined to sell. Rumors that the Hong Kong government was buying large bars suppressed the bullish sentiment. Market prices rapidly declined, falling sharply by more than ten taels, but from morning to noon, there were rebounds of three or four taels from time to time. Subsequently, the market initially hovered around sixty taels, but later Yuanxing Yongtai Kangrun and others continued to sell without stopping. Exchange rates deteriorated, and the market felt weak, plummeting eight taels to fifty-two or three taels. The previous day, large bars were reduced by half, and the price of silver fell by as much as 1.375 points.</p>
<p>Morning Opening High at Five Taels and Seven Coins The price of gold for October rose by five taels and seven coins to 567.4 taels. The gross price retreated from 69.5 taels to 63 taels, due to rumors from Fuchang and others. Before long, it rose by 5.4 taels, because it was learned that a prior order had to be reduced. It then reached 68 taels. At 9:30, the exchange rates were announced as being reduced, with British gold at 625, US dollars at 1.25 yuan, and Japanese gold increased by 0.425. However, the internal situation was not tight but rather weakened, falling from 66.2 taels to 64.5 taels. Subsequently, Yuanxing Yong and other speculators sold enthusiastically, and He also sold October British gold at 7 pence and 0.0625. Huashang Bank mutually traded November US dollars at 38.6875 yuan, and then added more than two taels, reaching 9:45 before starting to decline. Sellers became more vigorous and exchange rates frequently loosened. Mitsubishi and others sold October British gold at 7 pence and 0.3125, reaching 63.4 taels by 10:20, and soon broke through the 60-tael mark. Xiangyu Yongfeng Yuanxing Yong continued to sell without stopping, reaching only 58.78 taels. At times it also went over 60 taels again, and then back to 57.2 taels. At 11:30, Hengxing and others chased after purchases, breaking out of 60 taels to 61.78 taels. However, the closing market at noon was still weak, at 58.8 taels, with the listed price changed to 635.4 taels, a difference of nearly seventy taels. The price at noon was nearly seventy-five or six taels lower.</p>
<p>Evening Closing Falls by 8.1 Taels The price in the afternoon fell to 57.1 taels, but because the Indian exchange rate was low, buyers on the surface were still active, immediately rising by 3.0 taels. At around 2:30, it reached 60.05 taels. Suddenly, the selling intention became more enthusiastic, eager to go downstream, gradually falling into a state of weakness, falling miserably by five or six taels, reaching 54-55 taels at 3:30. Yuanxing Yong, Yuxing Yong, Taikangrun, and others sold even more, and British gold became even tougher, with October settling at 7 pence and 0.375. Soon, September was available for purchase at the same price, and then it continued to fall by two or three taels at 4:00, falling to 52.5 taels. At times it also added 2.5 taels, and then deducted 2.0 taels, reaching 53 taels. It was heard that at 4:30, the closing price was 53.6 taels, but it had already been listed up by two taels, due to scattered short-selling covering positions. Compared to last Saturday, it fell back by 8.1 taels, which was actually a reversal after repeated increases. The maximum price during the day was 69.5 taels, and the minimum price was 52.5 taels, a difference of seventeen taels. The listed price was more than eighty taels, so the market was logged twice, (double closing price) 70 taels to 59 taels in the morning, and 65 taels to 54 taels in the afternoon, with interest rates at 70 taels, two coins, and 65 taels. The price of goods was 67.7 taels in the morning, 57.5 at noon, 7.2 coins in the afternoon, and 4.5 at the closing.</p>
<p>Speculation is Divided, with Sellers Dominating In various transactions, selling exceeded buying. However, the cashiering was very erratic. Yuanxing Yong and Xiangyu acted on behalf of foreign merchants, with very large numbers. Fuchang, Yifeng Yong, Yongfeng, and Xinxing all made sales. Jinan, Hengxing, Yuancheng, Dadecheng, Yuancheng Yong, and Zhifeng Yong had varying inflows and outflows. Wanxing and Shunli had fewer purchases and more sales. Yuanmaoyong bought in to lead the way. In the afternoon, Yuanxing Yong, Taikangrun, Yuanmao, Yuxing Yong, and Jiutai all sold. Yuanmaoyong had more inflows and fewer outflows. Xinxing, Wanxing, and Shunli chased after purchases. Dalian businessmen first sold and then bought in about 4,000 taels, roughly breaking even. Guangdong businessmen had about 2,000 taels of inflows and outflows.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Officially Tight but Unofficially Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices for various currencies were reduced by 2.5 notches, due to the low silver market the previous day. British gold was reduced by 625 to one shilling and six and a half pence, US dollars were reduced by 1.25 yuan to 37.5 yuan, Indian rupees were reduced by 3.5 yuan to 104 rupees, French francs were reduced by 33 yuan to 954 yuan, and foreign currency was reduced by 3 yuan to 93.25 shields. German exchange was reduced by 5.5 yuan to 157 marks, Hong Kong currency was increased by 0.25 to 83.5 taels, Singapore currency was increased by 5 taels to 150.25 taels, and Japanese currency was increased by 0.425 to 1.3175 taels. As for the internal market, the British, American, and Japanese currencies were firm in the morning but weak later, especially in the afternoon, not only officially tight but also unofficially loose, due to the impact of the price of gold going from high to low, and breaking through 560 taels, with short positions turning from worry to joy, as large bars had a potential to rebound. The resulting prices compared to the previous weekend showed that British gold increased by 0.25, US dollars increased by 0.5625, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.015, making it difficult to grasp. Chinese merchants first bought and then sold, with more than 200,000 pounds of British gold traded, and more than 100,000 pounds settled. These were sold by Holland, Sumitomo, Mitsubishi, and Youli. A small number were also sold, and Shanghai absorbed them. Chinese merchants Yuanxing Yong and others sold some. Various banks also mutually traded more than 100,000 pounds, and more than 100,000 US dollars. Gold merchants sold 100,000 to Mitsui and others. The trading of Japanese currency was still mediocre, only involving internal transactions. Dalian recently had several hundred thousand, with banks such as Sanlin selling and Sumitomo buying in. The market atmosphere was one of consolidation.</p>
<p>British Exchange The internal market had fluctuations of 4375, with the September asking price at 1 shilling and 6.875 pence in the morning, October at 9375, November at 7 pence, and the buying price adding 0.0625. The noon closing had the September asking price at 7.1875 pence, October at 25, and November at 3125. The afternoon closing had the September asking price at 7.375 pence, October at 4375, and November at 7.5 pence, with the current month at 7.3125 pence, and the buying price adding 0.0625.</p>
<p>American Exchange The internal market had a fluctuation of 1.0625 yuan, with the September asking price at 38.3125 yuan in the morning, October at 4375, October at 5625, and the buying price adding 0.125. The noon closing had the September asking price at 38.9375 yuan, October at 39.0625, and November at 9.1875 yuan. The afternoon closing had the September asking price at 39.375 yuan, and November at 9.625 yuan, with the buying price still adding 0.125.</p>
<p>Eastern Exchange The internal market had a difference of 0.325 throughout the day, but few transactions were made. The September asking price was 1 tael and 2.9 fen in the morning, October at 2.85 fen, November at 2.8 fen, and the buying price subtracting 0.05 fen. The afternoon had the September asking price at 1 tael and 2.7 fen, with the buying price at 2.65 fen, and the December asking price at 2.6 fen, with the buying price at 2.55 fen. The afternoon had the September asking price at 1 tael, 2 fen, and 5.75, October at 2 fen and 5.25, and November at 2 fen and 4.75, with the buying price deducting 0.05 fen.</p>
<h3>The Interbank Interest Rate is the Same in the Morning and Afternoon, with the Forward Settlement More Complicated</h3>
<p>Market Overview Yesterday was Monday. Bank settlements were more complicated and the money shops also happened to have their 25th forward settlement, making public transfers quite busy. As for the quality of the market, it was mostly similar to the previous few days. The interbank interest rate fell a few cents, the silver interest rate remained the same, and the demand for foreign funds from merchants was still not weak. Yesterday, there were more than one million in exports, and there were sources from Guangzhou, but the demand stopped midway, and the situation became weak.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market in Decline</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, mainly due to the loosening of raw cotton. The Ningbo (潮) traders are buying strongly. It is said that yarn inventory in Shanghai is increasing. The situation of American cotton is unlikely to rebound in the short term, so major players are keen to sell. However, a certain factory and the Guangdong traders will settle a lot of contracts for this month. Dachangcheng has been increasing purchases for forward months with large quantities.</p>
<p>Renyuanbiao (人標) Plunge with High Pressure. The Renyuanbiao market opened with firm sentiment. Buyers increased purchases and rose five qian. In the second and third sessions, the Jinye traders sold, and the market fell, weakening. It fell nearly one or two taels, resulting in a drop of 1.35 taels for near months and no change for distant months. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were not strong, and raw cotton fell sharply, dampening market sentiment. Prices for various months fell by 0.469 taels to 1.23 taels. Total transactions for the day were 22,900 bales. Purchases included Dachangcheng 2,900 bales, Hengyi 1,100 bales, Heshen 550 bales, and Senkang, Hengde, Yicheng, Taichang, Changfeng, Tianchang, Yuda, Gengfeng, Hanfeng, Xiesheng, and Ruida 300 to 750 bales each.

<h3>Cotton Market Opens High and Falls Low</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very weak. The weather has been fine lately, and the new cotton harvest is progressing well. Bulls expect the harvest volume to increase daily if the weather remains unchanged. Manufacturers have no need to procure more cotton due to the surplus of old cotton. Thus, market sentiment has turned bearish. Several Indian yarn mills have also suspended operations, intensifying selling pressure. A certain manufacturer has entrusted a broker to sell the 35,000 dan of this month's cotton that they had settled. This shows that factories have sufficient raw materials. Sellers are preparing to deliver about 30,000 dan. It is said that there will be further changes in this month's market tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hanbiao (漢標) Drops by 0.07 Taels This Month. The Hanbiao market opened with American cotton stable and market sentiment firm. Prices for various months remained unchanged. In the second and third sessions, with favorable weather during the "Chushu" (處暑) period and cotton from various regions gradually entering the market, sellers became slightly more active, and prices for various months fell by 0.03 taels. In the afternoon, due to selling by a certain firm this month, prices fell further. Distant months were particularly weak, falling by 0.04 to 0.15 taels. Total transactions for the day were 71,300 dan.

<h3>Indian Cotton Inventory Decreases, Market Firm;</h3>
<p>English Cotton Initially Firm, Then Soft</p>
<p>Bombay: The market was firm last week due to reduced inventory and good spot demand. Local manufacturers only purchased a small amount at cheap prices. Demand for piece goods was very poor. There were many inquiries from Europe for Oomra cotton, but shipments were not high. In the Liaosheng area, the weather continued to be good, and there was hope for a good harvest. In the Benjer area, the weather and harvest were both favorable. In the Sinter area, there was slight pest damage. The situation in other areas was good. The Oomra region was in dire need of rain. The weekly statistics are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>|  | 1929 | 1930 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Accumulated receipts from September 1 | 5,336 | 3,464 |</p>
<p>| Weekend Inventory | 886 | 745 |</p>
<p>| Accumulated exports from September 1 | 2,722 | 2,575 |</p>
<p>| Exports to Europe | 894 | 927 |</p>
<p>| Exports to China | 328 | 456 |</p>
<p>| Exports to Japan | 1,430 | 1,130 |</p>
<p>| Other Regions | 60 | 62 |</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot demand was moderate last week. Futures were actively traded due to the rebound in American cotton, but there was a lot of hedging. The cloth market was not good, and prices softened again. Overall, the market still tended to be bearish. Egyptian cotton fluctuated with American cotton.</p>
<h3>Food: The River Rice Market's Decline Sharpens</h3>
<p>Dongxin Japonica Suddenly Drops by One Yuan.</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived at each dock, and sales were sluggish. Fresh Northern Japonica rice saw some inquiries, so the price of high-quality rice fell by another 0.3-0.4 yuan, a significant amount. Currently, high-quality rice on the market is around 20.05-20.06 yuan. The weakness of the trend is rare. Dongxin Japonica rice arrived in large quantities, but buying was weak. All parties were eager to sell their inventory, so the price suddenly fell by one yuan, opening at only 17.5 yuan. In total, it has fallen sharply by two to three yuan in recent days, showing a sharp decline. Thin paddy rice arrived in small quantities, but sales were very slow. Prices fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan in the market. Although the price fell, there were still no transactions. The market was unusually stagnant. New guest top grade rice turned sharply downward. A lot of goods have already arrived from the north road in recent days. The high-quality goods are better than the top grade rice that was delivered in the previous session, but due to the downstream situation, the opening price for top special grade rice was only 14 yuan, and ordinary high-quality rice was 13.4-13.5 yuan, a decline of about 0.4 yuan. The rebound of Baiyuan rice was also fierce, and buying was dismal. Top quality rice barely opened at 18.5 yuan, a further small decrease of about 0.2 yuan. The rice situation here was universally slashed. This was caused by customers who had been holding back, waiting to sell.</p>
<p>Hunan: River rice continues to arrive. Sales in the local port are slow, and transactions are few. Changbang Meiji and Su Tong Pokeng have softened uniformly. Various buyers do not care about the small amounts of goods. In fact, Yangmi is flooding the market, and stores on this street have abundant inventory. Moreover, Dongxin rice is arriving in large quantities, and Xixin rice will soon be launched. The general merchandise customers are very pessimistic about the future of the Jingmi market and are eager to sell. Therefore, yesterday, the peaceful Nanshi showed no spirit, and inquiries were very few. Dongxin and Beishi are similar, and the transformation of Yuan rice is happening, and the price is also weak, as well.</p>
<h3>Wuhu New Guest Indica Rice Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yangmi market initially showed signs of weakness, but then inland traders purchased mid-grade goods. Tianjin traders also bought one boat of Saigon rice with 1,000 bags. The market then stabilized. In the afternoon, there were continuing inquiries from inland villages, and the market seemed stable. The opening prices were 1,500 bags of Saigon rice, priced at 16.02 yuan to 15.35 yuan; 500 bags of Grade 2 rice, priced at 13.75 yuan; 500 bags of Big Broken rice, priced at 12.5 yuan to 11.8 yuan; 100 bags of Small Broken rice, priced at 14.5 yuan; and 100 bags of Cover Rice, priced at 15.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Guest Indica rice from all regions has entered the market. The harvest in Hunan is the best. Wuhu and Jiangxi are also better than last year. Wuhu is closer to Shanghai. The first batch of new rice has already been loaded and arrived, with 246 bags priced at 11.67 yuan, or 11.8 yuan including commission. It is said that it was purchased by Tianjin traders.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour Market Is Very Good</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday, there were short covering in the current month's futures contracts, and the market was very good. The opening price was 2.5725 taels. Factories were unwilling to deliver spot flour due to low inventory, and traders from the north and south oceans were preparing to purchase warehouse receipts. The market became more stable. Forward months were very weak in the morning, and there was no buying or selling. In the afternoon, Yang flour and wheat became tight due to the large movement in the gold market. Customers who were selling were also covering their positions, and the market was more active than the current month. At the close, the current month was up 0.01 tael, next month was up 0.005 tael, October, November, and December were up 0.0125 tael, and January was up 0.0175 tael.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Suddenly Rises by 0.05 Taels</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market yesterday, prices for all months were surprisingly active. This was still due to the rise in foreign wheat, few arrivals of spot wheat, and market sentiment being bullish. Customers continued to hedge forward months, which were slightly soft. The current month was driven up by high-quality factories competing for scarce spot wheat, and shorts dared not sell further due to the impending delivery date. Prices gradually rose, and the closing price was up 0.05 taels. September and October were up 0.02 taels each, and November, December, and January were up 0.03 taels each. Only medium-quality and low-quality goods arrived for spot wheat, and high-quality goods were scarce. Factories were very interested, so the price rose another 0.05 taels. More than 4,000 bags of various brands were sold, divided among various factories.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Zhangzhou and Tong'an Longan Simultaneously Launch New Products</h3>
<p>The longan produced in Zhangzhou and Tong'an has a good harvest this year. The Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel from Xiamen brought the first batch of new goods from Zhangzhou and Tong'an. All sizes of goods were available. The initial market will definitely be stable and active. The opening price can be expected today or tomorrow. Guangdong goods arrived a few days ago, but they were small and medium grains, and the market was ordinary. Quanzhou bubble longan will arrive in ten days, while Xinghua longan will take another twenty days. This year's harvest in various places is considerable. The market is expected to gradually loosen in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Raw Silk Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Factory Sales Stagnate... Prices Plunge by 0.2-0.3 Dollars</p>
<p>In the New York market, silk consumption has decreased significantly due to the reduction of machines and suspension of work in various silk weaving factories. Silk sales are sluggish. Last weekend, raw silk factory sales stagnated and silk prices plunged. Grade A was only 3.4 dollars per pound, Grade B 2.9 dollars, and Grade C 2.4 dollars, a decrease of 0.2-0.3 American dollars.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Is Unusually Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port was quite quiet. Duder Yongxing Jinlong and other firms were slightly interested in high-quality Zhenmei tea, but sales were very low. There were no major transactions in Zhenmei and Xiumei tea. The market was very depressed.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western Pharmacy announces that this summer's weather is hot and prolonged, not only in our country, but also in Europe and America, where the heat exceeds one hundred degrees. Moreover, Shanghai, with its large population crowded into small houses, is naturally more prone to epidemics than other ports. As a result, the number of epidemic prevention fluid sold by this pharmacy on the Fourth Avenue has been quite large recently. In terms of bottles, over 76 million bottles have been sold, an unprecedented achievement. This does not include wholesale to other ports and other summer medicines, they say.</p>
<p>The Yantai Changyu Company announces that the Golden Star Brandy and red and white wines produced by this company are brewed purely from self-grown grape juice, without any impurities. After analysis and testing by major doctors, it has been proven to be a tonic for replenishing blood. Since Mr. Zhang Junjian took over last year, he has diligently improved the wines, making the color and taste even more perfect. The company's general agency is located in Longxing Lane, Tianjin Road. A large quantity of wines has been shipped to Shanghai for sale. Those who wish to become distributors in this city or agents in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces are offered extremely favorable terms, they say.</p>
<p>The Qihua Company on Nanjing Road announces that since the price reduction on August 20th, the business has been very crowded because the prices of various goods have been greatly reduced. In addition to selling cheongsam dress fabrics for one yuan in the silk and cloth section, each department has a special discount section. For example, two-pound water bottles are sold for 85 cents each, new style cups and saucers are 95 cents for four sets, and all foreign men's and women's boots and shoes are discounted by 15%. Athletic shoes are discounted by 20%. This is truly a groundbreaking initiative, they say.</p>
<p>The Wing On Company announces that since the price reduction the day before yesterday, business in all departments has increased significantly. The sales of Conklin fountain pens in the stationery department have been particularly high. Male and female customers are seen constantly surrounding the counters to purchase them. Because Conklin fountain pens are specially discounted during this major sale, the original price of 14 yuan and 40 cents per pen is reduced to 9 yuan and 85 cents, with a limit of 500 pens. Engraving is free. There are also loose-leaf lecture binders for 50 cents each, Chinese letter paper for 1 yuan and 10 books, newly packaged letter paper for 1 yuan and 7 books, American pencil sharpeners for 2 yuan and 30 cents each, top-quality ink colors for 60 cents each, this brand of crepe paper for 10 cents per bolt, German pencils for 30 cents per dozen, and two dozen packs of stationery and envelopes for 40 cents per box. Conklin pen prices range from 5 yuan and 95 cents to 8 yuan, 1 jiao, and 9 fen, with dozens of varieties, they say.</p>
<p>The Xinyuanxing Advertising Department announces that the "Double Knife" brand disinfectant, a domestic product, is well-known for its low price and high quality, and is sought after far and wide. Recently, the disinfectant was tested by the Industrial Products Testing Institute of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. The results showed that the disinfectant, diluted 60 times with water, can kill typhoid bacteria in two and a half minutes. Diluted 110 times with water, it can kill typhoid bacteria in fifteen minutes. Although the effectiveness of this disinfectant is generally known by users, this test proves that public confidence will be further strengthened, they say.</p>
<p>The Taifeng Canned Food Company on Nanjing Road announces that today marks the fifth anniversary of the company. A major 10-day sale will be held. This is an annual major sale, and there will be no extensions. All goods are discounted by 15% off the original marked price to show appreciation to customers of the year. During each sale period, customers, recognizing that such opportunities are rare, create a very lively scene. This year, the variety of products is greater than last year. The liveliness of the sale period is expected to be even greater than last year, they say.</p>
<p>The Max Kay Confectionery Company, next door to the Shanghai Bank on Avenue Edward VII, announces that the company officially opened yesterday. It is operated by Mr. Huang Chujiu's son, Mr. Xianzhong, so the store was full of congratulatory guests and very lively. The name "Max Kay" is a combination of the words "Mask" and "Key," so these two objects are used as the trademark, which is very novel. Currently, tea, pastries, and candies are sold first. Western food will be added soon, and branch offices are planned. The chefs and waiters are all experienced, and the future development is unpredictable, they say.</p>
<p>The Danggui No. 1 restaurant on Fourth Avenue, opposite the Yanhua Building, announces that since the launch of the special 1 yuan and 2 jiao set meal, business has been more prosperous than last year. After 6 PM every day, the restaurant is very crowded. This is because the chef's seasoning is skillful, the ingredients are exquisite, and the menu changes every week with new and creative dishes that are delicious. Diners never tire of eating here. Other seasonal seafood dishes and affordable lunches and dinners are still priced as before, despite the recent rise in prices of all goods, to show appreciation and to repay the patronage of all sectors, they say.</p>
<p>The Qingyise Restaurant at the intersection of Third Avenue and Zhejiang Road announces that the chef of this restaurant has made many contributions to Cantonese cuisine. Since its opening, the various dishes served have been innovative, with the taste striving to be palatable and the ingredients selected to be fresh. The decor is elegant and the service is extremely attentive, ensuring that diners are satisfied. Now, in order to compete in the commercial arena, this restaurant has added many new, affordable set meals, ranging from 2 yuan to 10 yuan, for groups of three to five or eight to nine people. The dishes are particularly rich, and if anything is not to your liking, it can be changed. Therefore, recently, people from all walks of life have been coming for a drink more frequently than before, almost overwhelming the staff. Other individual snacks such as various congees and noodles, Guangzhou-style claypot rice, cold drinks, ice cream, soda, and shaved ice are all very welcome, they say.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Bookstore announces that the latest book published by this company, "The Romance of the Republic of China," is a masterpiece of Xu Xiaotian's hard work. It is published by the Xinhua Bookstore, managed by the Maijiaquan. It has been approved by the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters. Using the form of a novel to record historical facts, it details the truth of the recent fifty and a half years of revolution, the licentiousness of the Qing Dynasty, the tyranny of warlords and eccentrics, the conspiracies of politicians and staff, and the inside stories of military and political tides, with meticulous detail and vivid language. It is truly a new departure in modern novels. It is now sold at a special price of 3 yuan and 60 cents per copy, they say.</p>
<p>The Qingqing Art Company announces that this company has been established for many years and its business has been developing daily. Mr. Zhao Ze, the director of this company, has profound experience in art. Yesterday, he invited people from all walks of life to visit, and Mr. Zhao personally received and guided them through the company's various departments. Everywhere they went, Mr. Zhao gave detailed explanations. The layout of the sample department, the weaving department, and the art department was well-organized and full of dazzling products. The largest departments were the art and weaving departments. When the guests arrived at these two departments, the workers were working hard, the machines were humming, and the order was very good. Most of the staff in the two departments are high school graduates, so they are all experienced. Merchants from various silk factories and hosiery shops in Shanghai came in an endless stream, because the company's various products are far beyond the reach of other companies, they say.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Fudan Film Company announces that since its expansion, it has spared no effort in film production. Recently, in order to produce the film "Forty-Eight Knights of the Martial World," it has specially hired movie stars such as Yang Jingwo, Qu Yifeng, and Liang Saizhen to star in the second episode, "Great Havoc at the Sanqing Temple." This film has been released yesterday at the Central Theater, with full houses for both day and night shows, they say.</p>

<h3>Japanese Promote the Use of Domestic Products</h3>
<p>If the People Use Domestic Products as Much as Possible, 600 Million Yuan Can Be Saved Annually</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Quality and Price When Promoting Domestic Products</p>
<p>—A Good Example for Our People—</p>
<p>A translation from a Japanese magazine by the World News Agency states that the Japanese economy has fallen into a deep slump due to the postwar economic crisis and the Great Kanto Earthquake. The government is painstakingly seeking ways to break the current situation and believes that the only way is to promote domestic production to consolidate the foundation of the national economy and improve the balance of international payments. Therefore, there is a movement to use domestic products. The government has conducted extensive investigations on this matter. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has compiled a book called "Survey of Domestic Products," which records the actual situation of domestic industries. On the one hand, it investigates the types of consumer goods, compares the types of domestically produced goods and imported goods item by item, and divides them into several categories, namely (1) those that must rely on foreign countries, (2) those that cannot be produced domestically, (3) those that have domestic products but are too expensive, (4) those that have domestic products but are of poor quality and not suitable for use, and (5) those with other special circumstances. Experts conduct detailed reviews and comparisons of each category of goods, and the results are surprising to the experts, as many imported goods can be replaced by Japanese domestic products.</p>
<p>The following table lists seven categories of imported goods that can be replaced by Japanese goods, and the total value (in Japanese yen) of imports to Japan in the most recent three years:</p>
<p>1929</p>
<p>47,009,315 119,693,523 144,294,890 136,068,123 41,023,457 10,583,205 102,364,375 601,306,888 2,136,240,015 27%</p>
<p>1928</p>
<p>70,551,035 131,910,332 135,955,198 138,087,303 40,375,775 8,771,589 127,840,774 650,314,995 2,196,314,727 30%</p>
<p>1927</p>
<p>84,688,800 122,985,543 107,220,332 129,557,153 46,267,926 7,770,943 118,209,939 616,700,636 2,179,153,858</p>
<p>28%</p>
<p>Textiles</p>
<p>Metal Products</p>
<p>Machinery and Appliances</p>
<p>Chemical Products</p>
<p>Beverages and Food</p>
<p>Sundries</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>Total</p>
<p>Total Imports</p>
<p>Ratio of Total of 7 Items to Total Value</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that if the people purchase domestic products as much as possible, at least 600 million yen a year can be saved out of the total import value of 2.1 billion or 2.2 billion yen, and this amount of 600 million yen a year can enrich the country. The importance of the meaning of the people using domestic products can be seen. The above seven categories contain 271 types of goods, including 22 textiles, 31 metal products, 67 machines and appliances, 78 chemical products, 20 beverages and food, 47 sundries, and 6 others. However, the formal investigation has not yet been completed, and the actual number should be much higher. Based on this information, the government will work hard to encourage the people to purchase domestic products and hopes that the people will cooperate with the government to achieve this goal. The great cause of promoting domestic industries cannot be achieved by the government alone, and the whole people must unanimously support the government to succeed.</p>
<p>We Japanese people are slack and have developed extremely extravagant lifestyles, blindly estimating the value of foreign goods without realizing the severity of the domestic economic slump and the danger to the country's future. At this moment, we Japanese must rise up together, love and use domestic products to promote industry and increase national wealth. However, loving and using domestic products does not mean using all domestic products of inferior quality. The quality of domestic products that are poor must be improved. The issue of using domestic products is fundamentally an economic issue. Promoting the use of domestic products without regard to their quality and value is inappropriate. Therefore, Japanese manufacturers should pay attention to the issue of quality and value and strive to make them cheap and of good quality to compete with foreign goods. On the one hand, consumers should consider that the development of domestic products is greatly related to the future of national wealth and strength, and even if there is a temporary sacrifice, they should not care, but only use domestic products. If so, the improvement of domestic product output will be constantly improving.</p>
<h3>Siamese Minister of Commerce to Travel to China, Japan, and India</h3>
<p>To Investigate the Commercial Conditions of the Three Countries</p>
<p>Bangkok News: Siamese Minister of Commerce Kang Bitatide will soon depart from Siam to inspect the commercial conditions of China, India, and Japan. He plans to go to Japan first, stay for a month, and then go to China and India. His travel plan has already been internally determined, but has not yet been officially announced.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Enacts New Law to Prevent Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Some Criticize it as Interfering with Personal Freedom</p>
<p>Geneva News: The Swiss government is now implementing a federal law to prevent tuberculosis throughout the country. The content is extremely strict. Doctors must report every tuberculosis case to the local authorities in order to prevent its spread. If a deceased patient has contact with living people, doctors must announce whether the patient's death was due to tuberculosis. All public institutions are subject to this new law. School teachers, nannies, and students must undergo medical examinations. Any suspicious houses will be inspected by public groups. If they are found to be infected with germs, they will be prohibited from being inhabited. Anyone who does not comply with this law will be subject to heavy fines. Some criticize this new law as interfering with citizens' personal freedom, while others believe it is a sound law to eradicate tuberculosis and protect health.</p>
<h3>New Hygiene Movement Underway in France</h3>
<p>The Goal is "Preventing Disease Before it Happens"</p>
<p>University Professor Believes That Disease Can Be Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>France has a major new movement underway to promote health and eliminate disease. Its main purpose can be summarized in one sentence: "Preventing disease before it happens."</p>
<p>This movement began last year in Strasbourg, Alsace, when the Dean of Strasbourg University ordered that all medical students at the school undergo a detailed physical examination by a doctor at the beginning of their studies, and be subjected to several X-rays to check whether their bodies are healthy. The purpose of this measure is: "These students will all be engaged in medicine in the future, and are more likely to come into contact with patients than anyone else, so they need great physical resistance. Since they are going to be asked to treat the diseases of others, they should also know how to treat their own diseases. Since they must warn others, they should also know how to warn themselves."</p>
<p>A total of 97 medical students at the school (including 11 female students) were examined, and it was found that 24 of them were suffering from illnesses, but they were either unaware of them, or although aware, did not know their severity. Four-fifths of them found their teeth unhealthy as a result of local examinations. All students who have been examined are of course allowed to enter the school to study, but they are warned about their physical weaknesses so that they know to be cautious. This is to guide them on their path in life.</p>
<p>This trial method was heard by the Director-General of Education of the French government, who greatly appreciated it and decided to extend it to all public and private schools. Since January of this year, a middle school in Paris has followed this method, and all male and female students have been subjected to the same examination, which is repeated every three months. The school printed a small book called "Health Record" and distributed it to the students. The book records the results of each examination, and also measures the students' physical fitness on a regular basis, so that the extent to which physical exercise is appropriate and what kind of exercise is most beneficial is also listed in the book. There are various benefits to this method: (1) If the student is ill, the doctor can know his usual shortcomings from this when the family asks a doctor for treatment, (2) The physical education teacher in the school can use this to teach, (3) When the students enter middle school or university in the future, the school authorities can also know the physical condition of each student from this and pay attention to them separately. In short, this method has advantages and no disadvantages.</p>
<p>French scientists are all enthusiastic about this trial. For example, Professor Mazhoge of the Paris Pasteur Institute said, "It is far easier to prevent disease than to treat it. Looking around us, we hear about illnesses and suffering every day, and medicine has lost its authority, but if we pay attention to it early, the disease can be prevented. The biggest mistake is not knowing hygiene, listening to nature, and then crying in pain when the disease occurs, which is too late. If we can examine on a regular basis, we can find the enemy of health in its hiding place."</p>
<p>Another scientist, Mr. Xilaban, said, "Hygiene methods are negative. They only tell you what not to do and what mistakes should be avoided. Conversely, preventive treatment methods are positive. They tell you in advance what must be done to protect your health from harm. Engines, automobiles, and elevators are all checked daily. How can human organs not be examined on a regular basis? Professor Meeklin of Strasbourg University most appreciated this method and said, "In my opinion, I am certain that one day the world will completely eliminate disease, and people will only die of old age and not of disease."</p>
<h3>New Substitute for Steam</h3>
<p>Steam has great uses in modern civilization, but the method is still too clumsy and there is a risk of explosion, so scientists are still tirelessly seeking a substitute. Now, success has been achieved.</p>
<p>The new substance is called Heat Transte, scientifically known as Diphenyl, which is a chemical combination product that does not exist in its original state. It contains a great amount of heat and there is no danger of excessive steam pressure. At a temperature of 700 degrees, Heat Transte only has a pressure of 65 pounds, while steam has more than 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Two years ago, an oil merchant wanted to use the substance to replace steam in the work of refining gasoline, but was unsuccessful. At that time, there was only one pound of Heat Transte in the United States, worth 40 yuan. Later, Theodore Swann, a young chemist from Birmingham, Alabama, manufactured it in large quantities, and now it is only worth 30 cents per pound.</p>
<p>Heat Transte is made by explosively cracking benzene to drive out two hydrogen atoms from the hydrocarbon and synthesizing a new substance. It is a slightly yellow, white solid that melts at 155 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Heat Transte has proven to be a very useful substance. It has been made into amber-colored resin, black, and gray transparent solids, and is used in the manufacture of varnishes, insulators, fireproof products, and waterproof products. (Junshan)</p>
<h3>Rubber Inventory for Nine Months</h3>
<p>The Result May Be to Limit Production</p>
<p>The current rubber market is extremely cheap in London, New York, and Singapore. According to a survey by a certain party, the world's rubber inventory at the end of July was as follows:</p>
<p>Tons Tons</p>
<p>New York 155,000 Other 15,000</p>
<p>London 110,000 In Transit 90,000</p>
<p>Singapore 35,000 Total 405,000</p>
<p>Malaya 40,000</p>
<p>This inventory is approximately seven and a half months' worth of rubber, based on the world's total rubber demand of 710,000 tons and an average monthly demand of 60,000 tons. Deducting the total demand of 710,000 tons from this year's production of 840,000 tons leaves a surplus of 130,000 tons, which, combined with the 427,000 tons of inventory at the end of last year, will result in an inventory of approximately 559,000 tons by the end of this year, or an inventory of approximately nine months. On the one hand, the slump in the American market is gradually deepening, and the demand for rubber has not increased, but has tended to decline. The insecurity of the future is increasing, resulting in the above-mentioned low prices. Under this situation, producers and rubber dealers alike will inevitably fail. There is talk in England of limiting rubber production. The issue of production restrictions was previously advocated by Dutch growers, but no agreement was reached due to British indifference. Today, prices are extremely cheap, and this situation may lead to production restrictions.</p>
<h3>Many Banks in the United States Close</h3>
<p>More Than 400 Banks Closed in Five Months</p>
<p>New York News: According to the announcement of the Federal Reserve Board, the number of banks closed in the most recent five months was 404, with capital amounting to 139,902,000 gold dollars. Due to the deepening of the general business slump and the recent instability of early agriculture, the financial world is even more difficult. Some bankers predict that more banks will close this year, and the record of 956 banks closed in 1926 may be broken.</p>
<h3>World Saltpeter Conference to Be Held</h3>
<p>Japanese Reply That They Will Not Participate</p>
<p>Tokyo News: The World Saltpeter Conference will be held this fall. The conference has always been a global gathering for the saltpeter fertilizer industry. This year, it will also discuss fields such as production and sales. Invitations to participate have been sent to various countries. It is reported that the Japanese side, such as the Japan Artificial Fertilizer Company, has replied that they will not participate for the time being.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Baixing Grand Theater announces that the unprecedentedly grand hunting film "Jungle Adventure," shown in this theater, is extremely crowded with customers. Tickets have been sold out one hour before each show. The great magic of the film can be imagined. Now, in order to avoid crowding, this theater has added an extra show every day starting at 7:30 PM to facilitate the audience, they say.</p>
<p>The Xifan Film Company announces that the Qing Dynasty swordsman film "Golden Rooster Ridge," recently produced by this company, has extremely grand scenery and props. The original filming location was not sufficient, so it was specially borrowed from the Weilie Company to rush to build a small set. Yesterday, the scene of the bandits meeting at Golden Rooster Ridge was filmed. Three famous villains from Shanghai, Fei Baiqing, Pu Xianying, and Sun Shangxian, appeared on the stage at the same time, each displaying their strengths, and the performance was quite wonderful, they say.</p>
<p>The Qingtian Film Company announces that this company is now in Beiping engaged in the production of a martial arts romance film, "The Three Heroes of Yan." The play depicts the chivalry of northern men. The second play, "What Can Be Done," has been written by Chen Tianjun and will be filmed soon, they say.</p>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater announces that since the opening of the Russian revolutionary film "The Red Peril is Overwhelming," it has been sold out every day. The film is the latest production of the German Ufa Company, with grand scenery and a tight plot, unprecedented. It depicts the brutality and inhumanity of the Red Party, its greed for money and lust, like fierce tigers and hungry eagles, causing people to be heartbroken. Its depiction of the nobility's desperate plight and the princess's displacement can be said to be vivid and thorough, enough to make the audience shed tears of sadness. This is truly a rare revolutionary film, they say.</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company announces that the new film "Romantic Woman," which has been promoted by this company for a long time and is eagerly awaited by the public, has been completed for a long time. However, this company has repeatedly revised and added details to the film to make it a perfect film. Therefore, it has not been officially released until now. Now, this company has repeatedly received letters from the audience requesting an early premiere, and after consultation with the Central Grand Theater, it has been scheduled for official release in early September. It is expected that this domestic film, which for the first time purely depicts the abnormal psychology of women and is a grand film that impresses with the body and sensuality of the female lead, will be the first work of the romantic and fashionable star Xuan Jinglin to return to the screen and will cause a sensation in Shanghai, they say.</p>
