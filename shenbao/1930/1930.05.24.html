<p>時評</p>
<h3>英政局又可暫安</h3>
<p>因。工業生産過度發展。而致失業人數驟增。此爲各大國共有之現象。因失業驟增無法解决。而致政局動搖不安。亦爲今日各國所同。惟英國失業之成爲問題。巳近十年經過一九二一年險惡時期後。失業人數漸見減少然其後因煤礦大罷工問題發生失業又大增加。最近受商業衰落普遍之影響。當然愈增愈多。故英之失業問題較他國更難解决。歷任内閣與財政當局。恒爲此問題所困而倒。工黨重執國政之初。即關心於此一點。宣言必籌到一最善辦法。然而在此種一落千丈之情勢下。無論何等高明之經濟家。亦感束手。况乎工黨在議會中之勢力。並未占有多數。欲提較爲急進之辦法。則爲右派所反對。欲稍緩進。則又爲左派所攻其捉襟見肘之情形。早巳顯露。两月前保守黨借此問題曾一度提出彈劾案。内閣之形勢。巳甚岌岌。幸自由黨不欲於海會正在緊急之時。妨礙政府工作。遂起而與工黨協力打消之。政府始得轉危爲安。今不管部閣員摩斯萊。因不用其救濟政策亦在工黨特會中。提出彈劾政府之動議保守黨不欲於印度問題嚴重之時推翻麥唐納政府遂又將摩氏之動議打消於是工黨政府復可苟安於一時夫保守黨之欲取工黨政府而代之久矣。今乃不視爲獲取政權之機會。而反予以維持誠可與自由黨。同稱爲能顧全大局者也。雖然。此其維持。殆亦甚暫耳。失業問題。無法解决。則内閣必不能安。譬如人之患病。久醫不愈。必思另易一醫以治之。蓋望愈之心切。必愈求速效。一再進藥不愈。即表示失望。而易醫之念生。其實病果難治醫雖屢易而無用。且將愈易而愈難治也。</p>

<h3>高英案上訴判决書（續）</h3>
<p>（乙）關於凟職部分、查陳以迭次致函高英、謂有華工四人赴美、囑托其接引登岸、並許以重酬、迨該華工等抵美後、因發見護照係屬變造、並濫用巳裁撤之墨領館名義、復將其遣回、此等情節巳據高英一再供明、該項函件、亦經　以一承認係屬親筆、茲所當審究者、即高英對於陳以一之要約、巳事承諾、及接引華工登岸、是否在其職務範圍以内是巳、按外交部抄送之領事館職務條例第一條、雖僅規定領事之職務、在於發展本國商業、撫綏僑商、但此處之僑商二字、當作廣義之解釋、凡僑外之商民人等、均應解爲包括在内、此證諸同條例第八第九第十各條之規定、或稱本國人、或稱僑民、或稱在外僑商、即可明瞭、至接引登岸、自爲撫綏之行爲之一種、亦即爲撫綏僑民之起點、參以外交部公函所稱「領事職在保護僑民、故於到埠接引各節、雖無明文規定、如實際有必要之處、亦屬應行之事」等語、是接引華工登岸、當然爲領事職務範圍以内之事、可無疑義、辯護意旨、謂領事職務祇在保護僑商、斷章取義、殊難爲當、唯高英曾否承諾陳以一之要求、則爲事實問題、據陳以一述稱、「高英巳經答應、且有復信、不過該信巳不存在」云云、（見十八年三月偵查筆錄）此雖係片面之詞、但核諸陳以一所致高英之信函、初稱「今有三四人欲赴美、弟可代取外交護照、兄能接引否、如可每人酬一千、弟只取四分之一、」繼稱「兄如可允、速來一電、（中略）至五月十五如無電、唯令先行動身、（中略）兄得四分之一、俟登岸向取、」終則謂「在廣東接來電、他們巳經登輪、只得去了、返滬接來信、云墨名義不可用、好在只用一人、不知如何結果、該欵本可三千、旋攺二四、弟巳函請其加至二六、他們如巳平安上埠、乞電知、」（上開各信均陳以一卷内）足徵高英先巳承認、嗣知陳以一濫用巳裁撤之墨領館名義、始行函阻、並函告以墨名義不可用、且就陳以一續函中之磋商酬金數目之點以觀、更足爲高英期約賄賂之明證、况高英於該華工等抵美之前一日、曾向龔總領事聲稱、次晨將有華人四名、乘两比利丸抵埠、其中二人爲其私僕、請龔修函轉致移民長官、允其登岸、又曾親赴孫垣寓所、秘告該事、懇其襄助、此等情節、業經龔總領事呈報前駐美施公使在案、孫垣在偵查中亦稱「此事高英曾對我說過、謂陳以一托他辦、他可得點報酬、但不說明三千」云云、龔總領事之呈報、亦復相符、就上述種種、參觀互證、則高英對於職務上之行爲、期約賄賂、實屬無可諱言、不過尙非對於違背職務上之行爲期約賄賂耳、</p>
<p>以上係就本案犯罪事實之認定、及其所憑之證據、而加以解釋、茲應進而研究原判是否適當、及夫上訴有無理由、先就第一點言之、關於雅片部份、高英高廖氏均應成立帮助販賣雅片未遂罪、巳如前述、原判認高廖氏犯輸運雅片罪、高英犯帮助輸運雅片罪、如其犯罪行爲係在新禁烟法施行以後、尙無不合、因該法第六條、關於運輸行爲、並無地點之限制、故不問自外國輸入中國、或自中國輸出外國、或由外國輸至外國、均包括在内、但高廖氏等之犯罪行爲、實在新禁烟法施行以前、（新禁烟法係十八年七月二十五日公布施行）依舊禁烟法第一條及刑法第二百七十一條之規定、其運輸情形、祗限於自外國輸入中國或自中國輸出外國、若由外國輸至外國、則無處罰之明文、高廖氏携帶之雅片係由英屬之香港運至美國、依刑法第一條之規定、即無適用新禁烟法處以運輸罪之館地、原判仍論以運輸雅片罪、此不當者一、又按新禁烟法第二條、旣採從新主義、規定「本法施行期間關於違犯烟禁者之科刑、應依本法之規定」等語、即爲刑法第二條從輕主義之例外、故不問犯罪是否在該法施行以前、概應依該法論罪科刑、斷無適用舊法輕刑之餘地、原判不依新禁烟法處斷、而又援刑法第二條但書之規定、比較新舊刑罰輕重而用較輕之刑、此不當者二、又按黨員背誓罪條例、第一條第一項之規定、「黨員違背誓言而爲不法行爲者、分别情形、按刑法加一等以上處罰等語、所謂刑法、當指普通刑法而言、若特别刑法上之犯罪、自不能用該條項之規定、而加等處罰、原判不認高英犯特别刑法禁法上之罪、而又依黨員犯罪條例加重處罰、此不當者三、孫垣對於販賣雅片部份、實爲直接重要之帮助犯、如前所述、巳有充分之證明、乃原判認爲犯罪嫌疑不能證明、遽依刑事訴訟法第三者十六條諭知無罪、此不當者四、關於凟職部份、高英祗能成立刑法第一百二十八條第一項之對於職務上行爲期約賄賂罪、原判認爲觸犯同法第一百廿九條第一項之對於違背職務行爲期約賄賂罪、此不當者五、又本案發覺之雅片二千二百九十九罐、均被美國海關扣留、並加以處分、移送到案者僅有两罐、即祇能就此两罐諭知沒收、乃原判概予宣告沒收焚燬、此不當者六、次就第二點言之、檢察官之上訴意旨、業於原判諭知孫垣無罪部份、加以指摘、固應認爲有理由、無待深論、至高英高廖氏之上訴意旨、業於犯罪事實、空言否認、雖非可採、而其攻擊原判不當、亦尙不得謂爲毫無理由、</p>
<p>總上論結、合依刑事訴訟法第三百八十五條第一項、撤銷原判、更爲判决、高英孫垣以公務員帮助販賣雅片未遂一罪、應各依刑法第九條第四十四條第一項及第三項後段、禁烟法第三條第六條第十二條第十五條、加倍處斷、高廖氏帮助販賣雅片未遂一罪、亦依刑法第九條第四十四條第一項及第三項後段、禁烟法第二條第六條第十二條處斷、高英對於職務上之行爲、期約賄賂一罪、應依刑法第二條第一百二十八條第一項、國民政府天字第一六零號訓令、黨員背誓罪條例第一條第二項、特别刑事法令刑等計算標準條例第五條、加重本刑三分之一處斷、（刑律第一百四十條第一項之刑、雖比刑法第一百二十八條第一項之刑爲輕、但加一等後、則較刑法加三分之一後爲重、依刑法施行例第三條、各别加重、後者之重輕、仍應適用刑法處刑、）並依刑法施行條例第七十條第一第五两欵、定其執行刑罰、又該被告等均應依刑法第六十四條第五十五條第二項至第五項、諭知折抵覊押及易科監禁、雅片两罐、應依禁烟法第十四條沒收焚燬、特爲判决如主文、</p>

<p>試觀四國之實力、印度祗派選手四名、其目的在聨絡國際感情、固不在乎勝敗、大會八項錦標、日本穩得田徑全能游泳三項、中華足球隊定能凱旋而歸、籃球排球亦有把把握、其他網球棒球二項、日本因頭等選手尙在參與台維斯杯賽、仍以二等角色出席、吾國邱林球藝不弱、能與日本一决雌雄、至於棒球、吾國派檀島華僑隊出席、精銳異常、實爲日本之强敵、菲律賓之於各項比賽、表演定能良佳、然少錦標希望、故總觀大勢、日本因人才較多、且以逸待勞、獲得總錦標、固有把握、然中華亦實力充足、前途大有希望、勉乎哉、吾中華隊、</p>
<p>至於吾中華田徑技術、雖不及日菲、然亦猛進不巳、本屆成績、當能超過上屆、女子田徑表演、亦有健將出席、孫桂雲在日、巳爲衆注目、女子游泳表演、有香港二選手前往、凡此種種、均爲中華之好現象、吾人安得不額手相慶乎、</p>
<p>雖然、人民之康健、並不在少數之選手、民族之光榮、豈僅在運動之錦標、凡吾民衆若欲身體之强壯、宜普及户外有益之運動、摒除户内無謂之娛樂、無論男女老小每日宜有相當之練習、如是則全國人民身體康健、特别人才、亦易産生、故記者在本屆遠東會開幕之日、深望中華選手獲得錦標、更望運動能普及全國也、</p>

<h3>劉長春傷未愈</h3>
<p>退出百米二百米</p>
<p>祗加入四百米跑</p>
<p>｜我國田徑希望益少｜</p>
<p>本報二十三日東京電記者今日晤劉長春、據稱敎練因其在滬腿筯傷後、尙未完全復原、若再不自審度、多所參加、恐將復傷其腿、故巳决定僅試作四百米賽跑、退出一百米與二百米賽跑、渠於此種不得巳之挫折、至覺遺憾、而田徑賽一門、我國之希望、亦因此益少矣、</p>
<h3>中華棒球可畏</h3>
<p>｜可望奪得錦標｜</p>
<p>｜日本認爲勁敵｜</p>
<p>本報二十三日東京電日本對於我國棒球隊、暗中實頗畏懼、因今次旣有數健將加入、實力雄厚、而隊員中對於發球準確、擊球得法、及跑壘敏巧三端、又各有長才、今後我國選手、如能應戰順利、亦可望奪得棉標、以故今番日本認我國爲最有力之勁敵云、</p>
<h3>田徑决賽預測</h3>
<p>千五百米····中菲少希望</p>
<p>跳高············日菲必力爭</p>
<p>李仲三········有得分機會</p>
<p>跳遠············恐爲日全勝</p>
<p>本報二十三日東京電此次田徑賽預測、一千五百米日選手津田曾有四分九秒又十分二之最高紀錄、而日選手北本與角谷两人、亦俱可占前三名位置、我國選手姜雲龍、與菲選手耶泰爾、俱少希望、跳高則菲選手多利皮窪有一米九四六之最高紀錄、而日選手亦滿擬一雪往歲两戰俱北之恥、將有一番猛烈競爭極爲會衆所注意、我國選手李仲三、如能超過本人前此之紀錄、亦不難於記分上、爲中國爭得一分也、印度選手尤塞夫、則猶若賽馬中之冷門、不易預料、跳遠則日選手南部有七米零六之最佳紀錄、而其他選手亦不弱、恐前數名皆爲日得、蓋就以往之成績言、田徑賽一門、日本實居優勝地位、中菲二國、殊少取勝機會焉、</p>

<h3>錦標爲中日所逐鹿</h3>
<p>第九屆遠東運動會日本輪及爲地主特於東京建築會塲、所耗甚巨、參加者中日菲印四國選手約四百人、定於今午在神宮田徑塲由總裁秩父宮行開幕典禮、誠遠東國際間空前之盛舉也、中日菲印四國選手之實力、各有專長印度首次加入成績尙難深悉異軍突起、或能予三國驚奇之印象人數不多、參加項目又少、其於總錦標、當無希望爰本調查各國過去之成績、考察目下之紀錄、申論比較之、藉供國人之參考</p>
<p>（一）足球</p>
<p>遠東運動會自有史以來除第一屆外、足球錦標、全歸中國所有、此乃我國無上之榮譽也、國人對於足球一項素所重視普及之程度成績之優越、逈非日菲两國所能企及、其能永執東亞間足球錦標者、良有以也日本自上届擊敗菲律濱之後奪標野心勃然而起、本年在三個月之前巳挑擇選手聚合訓球練球藝日進、曾一度打敗與二年前樂華平手之開恩脫英艦引以爲榮據其自述堪與中國隊一較長短、菲律濱則非其敵手、其言不無誇張然實際上之進步、亦足令人注意也菲之宣言自知不及中國、惟必戰勝日本保住其亞軍地位菲隊人才、較往年爲佳、故日菲實力、堪稱伯仲、至長勝軍中國隊之内容一如往昔之精銳内部堅固嚴密、確可後顧無憂两翼人才、爲遠東首屈一指、中間三人、亦　　會塲圖</p>

<h3>日本不印入王外長頌詞</h3>
<p>蔣代辦認爲侮辱舉動</p>
<p>限今晨八時正式道歉</p>
<p>否則中華隊退出比賽</p>
<p>今晨本報東京電前晨中國使館接外交部訓令蔣代辦、代表外交部王正廷、於今午開幕時讀頌詞、蔣代辦昨晨即將此事通知日體育恊會會長岸清一、彼答、時間太遲、不及排入秩序單、言時、聲色俱厲、蔣代辦認爲侮辱、大憤、立曯郝伯陽與日本體育恊進會交涉、要求正式道歉、並將王外長頌詞排入秩序單内、限今晨八時答復、否則中華隊、退出比賽、惟我代表團負責者、則不贊成此急激舉動、現交涉正在進行中、</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>堪稱職、李惠堂如能腫消出塲、輔以孫錦順戴麟經二人彼時奪門登壘、恍如襄中取物、雖然以中國隊全體之技藝比較而論、李即未在、奪取錦標、亦意中事耳、</p>
<p>（二）籃球</p>
<p>菲律濱之於籃球、猶如中國之於足球、造詣極深、大會舉行八次、錦標屬菲者七屆、此次赴日、其最有希望厥爲籃球錦標一項、並於中國籃球之飛突進步、故不敢以必獲錦標而自豪中國籃球隊之人才、較任屆爲佳南開之五虎、加以北平上海之名將又得騐豐富於董守義之指導、全隊成績、可想而知、戰勝菲律濱、似非難事、打敗日本、當無問題矣、日本於籃球一項亦早有準備、因其平日不甚注意、一時雖加訓練、究難敵中菲之精銳也又自認以前之失敗、由於身材過短之原因、此次挑擇選手、以身高體重者表準、一種猛進之精神、至嘉許也、</p>
<p>（三）排球</p>
<p>此項錦標爲中菲輪流所有、大會舉行八次、各占其半、其勝利之定每因地理而轉移、在菲屬菲、在中歸中此中蓋含有精神上之作用也、今番在日舉行、勝負之數、雖難預定、然本屆中國隊球藝之猛進人才之超衆、確在菲律之上、重獲錦標可成事實日本排球自大會成立以來缺席五次、出塲三次、然三次比賽、均遭敗北、蓋其實力薄弱不及中菲遠甚、本年三月份起、選拔全國優秀份子日久訓練抱堅决精神、力圖雪恥、勝人固少把握、然敗之亦非易事耳、</p>
<p>（四）網珠</p>
<p>前屆中國選手林寳華邱飛海、連敗菲日奪得錦標開大會未有之局面、至今尙傅爲美談、本屆代表、仍係林邱、然而今非昔比前之受挫於我者、今恐將爲人挫矣、本年二月初旬、日之佐藤與布井在菲島舉行嘉年華會時、曾打敗林寳華是其明　、本屆日本第一流名手巳赴歐參加台維司杯蓋自知其第二流人才足以應付中菲也出席選手單打佐藤、布井、雙打山岸志村兒最近布井山岸志村在國内累次失利、被人指摘、錦標呼聲中日本漸低、而中國反見趨高日菲對於邱之技藝、最覺可畏、因彼巳脫盡火氣、工夫純熟也、菲之網球成績、在大會中、有相當地位、邇來未見進境累被中日壓倒、此次錦標、恐難染指、結果非日即中、然其勝負、應響於二國之總錦標不少也</p>
<p>菲選手乘專輪到日情形</p>
<p>（五）棒球</p>
<p>最近數年棒球錦標成爲菲日囊中之物中國前屆由檀香山華僑代表、表演成績、大使日菲驚奇、一變前之輕視之態度、本屆日本以應慶爲重心、加以其他好手、組織成隊實力健强不可一世、然不敢以冠軍自大者、有所畏懼耳彼之勁敵非復爲菲、實乃中也、此次菲之棒球隊、多選自稅關局各大學之選手亦會合在内、巳經苦刻之訓練、技藝大有可觀、惟與中日相較略遜一籌、錦標希望難成事實至於萬衆注目之中國棒球隊、好手獨多、攻守投擊之技能老老練有勁、日菲爲之側目、此次金鋼鑽道上、三國選手將有劇烈之爭勝負所擊、極爲重要中日之總錦標問題或將爲之轉移也</p>
<p>（六）游泳</p>
<p>此項運動中國尙在幼稚時代在昔第二屆大會、中國曾大露頭角、高占鰲頭第三届亦差可人意、乃以提倡不力進步未見、日菲二國則銳意猛進、遂相差益遠、去届新加坡華僑回國効勞、仍難與人爭雄本届人才、與前仿彿、失敗不免也日本游泳成績、至堪驚人前届失敗之原因、爲當時美國檀島舉行國際游泳大會日本將其精銳選手五人、盡派往該處參加乃以第二流選手參加遠東大會、致遭慘敗認爲憾事本年謝絶出國比賽、專心一志、準備奪回錦標、大勢觀去、必成事實往昔二國實力各有所長菲擅短距離日專長程、今則日本短長皆全、如高石、佐田、二人足與菲之名將安利、伍爾加爭短距離中之首席、而長距離中、日之人才又較出色牧野鶴田尤爲此中翹楚、菲之伊爾德不能如去届之稱雄一時也總之游泳一項、日本抱十二分必勝之觀念、彼時必能如願以償也、至於菲之此次失望之最大緣故、爲有優秀選手九人、在預選時宣告脫離也、</p>
<p>（七）全能運動</p>
<p>此項運動、始自前届日本首執牛耳、今香二次舉行日菲又將有劇烈之競爭矣、五項十項雙方各有精銳戰士、勝負難分、八百及千六百米之接力日本咸占上風、平均而論、日有七八成把握、菲僅二三成耳、中國極少希望、但不知新加入之印度爲如何耳、</p>
<p>（八）田徑賽</p>
<p>中國於田徑賽一項、極少把握、前在中國舉行時僅望參加之選手、盡其所能、得良好之表演而巳、今番前去、人才較多、奪標固無希望、得分或在意中想不至如前届之毫無所獲也、觀本年三國成績表、劉長春之四百米及李仲三之跳高、或可得一二分耳、菲律濱方面人才平均各項首席、難與日爭、即案所擅長之短距離日亦有相等之成績、未能專美於前、由茲而觀、日之獲田徑賽、猶如中之獲足球俱同一之把握也、印度參加四人、成績未知、或者一鳴驚人、亦未可知、</p>

<h3>競賽方法</h3>
<p>共計有八項錦標</p>
<p>多得者獲總錦標</p>
<p>两國錦標數相等</p>
<p>亞軍數定總錦標</p>
<p>｜女子賽係表演｜</p>
<p>｜與錦標無關係｜</p>
<p>遠東運動會之競賽方法最初爲分數制、將各種運動、納爲一個整個的錦標、以得總分之多寡、定各國優勝之順序、後按運動之種類、採用錦標制例如現有八種運動、即定爲八種錦標、其名目如下、（一）田徑錦標、（二）全能錦標、（三）游泳錦標、（四）足球錦標、（五）籃球錦標、（六）排球錦標（七）棒球錦標、（八）網球錦標以得錦標之多寡、定各國勝負之位次但如遇二國或二國以上所得錦標之數目相等時則以各項錦標第二名之較多者爲大會之總錦標他如女子競賽等、俱屬表演性質、並不在正式錦標内計算、故雖以錦標爲名、然其結果何如、與大會勝負不生關係也、</p>
<p>（一）田徑錦標共分十五項運動、（一）百米、（二）二百米、（三）四百米、（四）八百米、（五）千五百米、（六）一萬米、（七）百十米高欗（八）二百米低欗（九）跳高、（十）跳遠、（十）（一）三級跳遠、（十）（二）撑竿跳高（十）（三）推十二磅鉛球、（十）（四）擲標槍、（十）（五）擲鐵餅、每項運動錄取四名、其計分法每項之第一名五分、第二名三分、第三名二分、第四分一分矣十五項運動中所得總分之最多者爲錦標</p>

<h3>誌胡佛夫人之好客·柳·枝</h3>
<p>美總統胡佛夫人。擅交際。好賓客。曩居平津。國人多有識之者。自乃夫獲選元首。夫人遂得稱合衆國第一貴婦人。而其好客之習。依然如平時。以故白宮之中。時有佳賓。聨翩蒞止。夫人周旋欵待。惟渥惟優。夫人每日必與其夫同餐。餐時每偕數客同席。一年以來。鮮不如是雖饌未必豐。酒未必美。而俗禮盡蠲。互忘賓主。以視正式宴會。反覺其繁文縟節。不能暢飲食之樂矣。每星期日之夕。輒邀女友十數人。小宴於宮中。酒酣耳熱。相將試新歌。舞狐步。歡喜暢快。渾忘夜色之深沉也。星期日之外。間亦有臨時聚宴之舉行。猶憶去年聖誕節。小胡佛由任所遄歸。（小胡佛在某無線電局任工程師）夫人設宴爲之洗塵。惟倉卒間無人作陪。乃藉電話四處邀請、一時電鈴之聲丁丁然。亘數小時不止。亦白宮中從來未有之趣事也。夫人頗重視音樂家。嘗手書欽佩崇拜之辭。親自致授。得之者。目爲無上之榮幸焉。又夫人於宴會時。每採擷宮中之名花。遍置於女賓之座前。生香活色。頗足使諸女賓愈增美麗云。</p>
<h3>樊光詩寵重光·雲舫·</h3>
<p>樊光。字震初。浙之縉雲人。近曾一度代理外次。與外長王儒堂博士敦交蘭石。並列勝流。其人辦事精幹。貌則恂恂如書生。長於詩詞。年來居北。輒多題詠。所契如内長張我華氏。亦工詩學。時有投贈。篇章粲然。都中傅誦。日本駐華公使重光雅好我國詩曲。當筵喜談風雅。邂逅所契。嘗乞雲箋。重光公使於立夏日來京簽訂中日關稅協定。王外長讌之官舍。樊氏即席賦句。詩曰。仙槎重蒞石頭城。佳節歡聨两國盟。華夏而今方盛大。關河從此喜澄清。日高鍾阜星辰拱。（時英美和各公使均由北平來京）花麗秦淮劍佩明。回首春光長浩蕩。瀛寰萬里望同榮。百年關市始平征。九十春陰一日明。人爲迎賓賡納夏。天如得意放新晴。江山勝處開清讌。樽俎歡融按酒兵。從此坫壇傅盛事。晋秦永好賦同盟。重光當筵朗誦。擊節不置。一時傅爲韻事焉。</p>
<h3>贛北之老茶商·瓞·華</h3>
<p>贛東共匪方志敏。本月由磨盤山率衆向贛北饒屬進發。侵攬德興樂平。所至屠殺焚燒。兇熖不可嚮邇。值德興新茶。山户將採製完竣。儲藏待沽。惟因匪故。遠近茶客。俱不敢冒險往辦。有玉山年逾八旬之老茶商劉某者。携欵獨往。隨匪所經各村。搜辦新茶。每元價買七八斤。山户恐爲匪燒踐。咸願贬價賤沽。欵盡載運而歸。利市十倍。有人謂劉曰。虧汝老年人。要錢不要命。竟向匪中求發財耶。劉笑曰。正是兵匪中可以發財。所謂人棄我取。亂世年頭。予吾商人發財之機會正多。是在膽識之倖求。余年八旬。不畏菲殺。何患爲。一時聞者。無不佩其勇敢云。</p>
<h3>記一日間之趣游·程·志·政</h3>
<p>五月十八日。課餘有暇。清游一日。其間趣事獨多。聊記一二。以誌鴻雪可乎。</p>
<p>萬人看公爵是日爲同文書院三十週紀念。先一日。友人顧休祥王沿津二君來邀。乃於晨九時往焉。至則該校巳佈置一新。學生宿舍中。各以特異之佈置。寓政治社會意味於其間。名曰寮祭。亦别開生面者也。該院院長爲日本之公爵近衞文磨。方自日來滬。十一時。舉行前院長津根銅像開幕禮。即由公爵揭幕。公爵年纔三十餘。聞與日皇同輩。蓋亦世襲者也。當公爵致開會詞時萬衆圍觀。擁擠萬分。乃天不做美。竟下微雨。於是公爵乃不得不於雨中保持其鎭靜態度。後日外使重光亦致詞。其對公爵。極爲尊敬。</p>
<p>冠生園之羣英會午後赴冠生園。蓋是日爲平潮旅滬同學會歡送鑑人·志函·望之·休祥·銘書五君畢業之期也。一時冠生園中。極爲熱鬧。於互相致賀答勉之外。復多諧謔。直至五時。始告散會。</p>
<p>便宜吃不着前日滬報登載益利汽水與烟台啤酒在新世界任人試飲。不加限制。並不取分文等。一時聞風而往者。頗不乏人。是日會畢。適爲贈送之最後一天。予乃偕簡齋齋策安同往。滿欲一貪便宜。乃抵新世界。萬頭攢動。鐵門緊閉。揭示云。今日客滿。不能容納。予儕乃大懊喪。然觀後至者。猶實繁有徒也。滬人之喜貪便宜。可謂相習成風矣。</p>
<p>意外之納凉新世界旣嘗閉門羹。頗欲得一清靜之地。以資小憩。或議入公園。以代價過昻。究亦無取。是時跑馬廳適在目前。予倡入。友以恐被擯爲言。予曰。始一試可耳。乃相偕行。一路順風。未遭留難。自喜之外。復不能無慨。蓋租界爲我國之領土。今則太阿倒持。以本國之地。本國人尙不能自由游覽。信可悲矣。跑馬廳佔地絶廣。一望無垠。芳草如茵。翠色欲流。而畫樓一角。依稀海市。暮景之佳。誠爲僅有。予等小步一周後。即憩於椅。東望西藏路一帶。巨厦高聳入雲。燈光自窗隙外射。點點若繁星。南則大世界氣象萬千。北則三公司之蔚然矗峙。海上繁盛。一望而盡收眼底矣。維時清風拂衣。凉氣襲人。坐久之。炎暑應消。乃步出廳門。而歸校焉。</p>
<h3>威尼斯商人之反響·天·聲</h3>
<p>戲劇恊社第十四次公演莎士比亞傑作「威尼斯商人。」考據十六世紀伊大利之服裝布景道具等。以特别製造之故。許化去資本三千餘金。於是頗引起一般左翼文學界之反響。如某大學一部份自命爲無産階級之學生公然揭貼標語。攻擊此種貴族色彩過于濃厚之戲劇演出。而另有一派人物。則力反是說。起而擁護戲劇協社。謂藝術領域之偉大。不能受何種之限制。藝術家之口號爲無時代的無國界的更不能爲某種思想所束縛。戲劇協社此次公演「威尼斯商人」似巳引起藝術界之論戰。該社諸君亦足以自豪也。聞戲劇恊社素來所抱宗旨。係「爲演劇而演劇。」故深不欲混入論戰之漩渦。以待各派爭論之自然的解决。又另有一派人物。則謂戲劇協社「威尼斯商人。」未免太覺闊氣。如布景之宏麗。服裝之鮮艶。幾超過天蟾之封神榜丹桂之驚天動地之設備。娛樂色彩太覺濃厚。除足供姨太太階級之欣賞外。毫無價值。則措詞之失當。更不可解矣。就記者所知。是劇服裝布景。旣以十六世紀伊大利時代爲背景。而劇本所描寫者。又爲當時之貴族。衡之戲劇協社之舞台設備。尙未能盡富麗堂皇之能事也。現此劇定於今日（禮拜六）明日（禮拜日）仍在中央大會堂復演。凡同情戲劇協社之主張者。不妨前去一觀。俾證余言之是否確當焉。</p>
<h3>松鼠趣劇記·廉·翁</h3>
<p>滬西泰威坊。日前來一少婦。黑鬢紅衫。江北産也。背負一囊。蠕蠕而動。手執小鑼。作噹噹聲。旁觀詢之。曰囊皆松鼠。能演劇博人一笑。得百枚銅幣足矣。好事者假以席地。婦乃釋囊解結。松鼠六七。巳脫然而出。</p>
<p>婦乃於囊出鐵環四。鈎連不斷。懸之空中。松鼠緣而上。次第翻筋斗而下。如是者三。各松鼠此起彼落。如穿花蝴蝶然。此一幕也。婦收圈後。出紅布一。布上畫有方罫。松鼠先按四角矗立。繼乃銜尾疾走。團轉於方罫中。不越一步。此五幕也。婦摺疊紅布一囊。又出一鐵桿。貫两小球。松鼠上球運動。更番替代。復拆散置案。松鼠更抛擲爲戲。極形靈活。此則并二幕爲一幕矣。四幕旣畢。婦探懷出松子飼之。飼畢仍裝入囊中。携錢而去。</p>
<p>觀者曰鼠之演劇。貪數松子耳。人之因謀食而供人玩弄者。孰非此鼠耶。噫。</p>
<h3>意大利的聨合婚禮·秋·水</h3>
<p>意相墨索里尼。爲現代世界怪傑之一。思想超羣。而手段更富有辣性。最近在其國内。竭力提倡家庭制度。謂將來意大利之幸福。全擊於各個家庭之中。其意似近於我國家齊國治之古訓也。月初。意大利之菊逸詩得Lrieste城中一敎堂CathedralofSanGiusto中。舉行聨合婚禮。有七十對新夫婦同時結婚。墨索里尼特派捧喝黨之首領及各省長官、到塲證婚。則此巨大之婚禮。及兼有社會與政治之氣味矣。其盛况當亦不難想像得之。七十對夫婦交拜旣畢。乃羣赴羅馬作自由之蜜月旅行。而墨索里尼與敎王均將按日接見。以示贊助奬掖之意云。</p>
<p>歐游通訊（五十五）·劉·海·粟</p>
<p>瑪諦斯六十生辰（B）</p>
<p>瑪諦斯的藝術是有光輝。一致。無破綻的完全的藝術。這也是現今歐羅巴人所一體稱賞的。就是對於繪畫沒有相當研究的人。也能一眼辨别出瑪諦斯的畫的情味來。因爲他那畫面都有他的不可模擬的特性。他的作品裏投射着他更深一層的生命和體魄。換言之。我們在觀賞他的畫的時候。就像見到他本身的投影。正如瑞士的白峯在它投影的萊夢湖心裏顯示它的清奇或莊嚴的恣態。他的作品中的一切都是形的機能。美學的實質。沒有悲劇或善劇般的記錄。沒有温柔或嚴肅的表情。毫無何種情感的露洩。純藝術的想像之用於實際再沒有較他更爲澈底。他的每一張畫布都是純粹的景色Spectacle用爲觀賞的東西。光學的實現於畫幅之上。視官感覺的綜合。所有這些經過我們的網膜傅入我們的腦海織出一種清脆的陶醉與澄澈的激發的東西。旣沒有舖張也沒有朦糊混亂的原素。許多人說。這種基礎是精神的作用。當然的。本來就是在這位大師的速描Dessins中也可以發現「精神」之存在。但是他描寫的「法則」却無從尋覓。這正是創造這種特異而新頴的藝術的原素。而成爲一種奇異而窘人的東西。這是偉大的純正的藝術。但是他現在還在那裏無窮無極的整個的創造。他是毫無宗敎的。悲憫的。英雄的。道德的一般人類所企慕的偉大。他的精神是按他獨有的節奏。創造畫幅自身的目的。而爲智慧的産品在近代美術史上得到最大的勝利。</p>
<p>在一八九六年瑪諦斯送了十三張畫到SalonduChampdeMars。從此他的畫便引起了許多的爭論。但是在這次展覽會中所陳列的只有四五張是一九一七年以前的作品。其中有十幾張是大戰以後的作品。其餘的都是近作了。却是他舊作和近作的中間沒有一點本質的差異。却還有種堅固的聨絡。不過他從前所想的。不必便和今日一樣。那思想的根本雖不會攺變。却是各人思想自身常常的進化。那表現的方法便也轉變起來。</p>

<h3>日人經營朝鮮紡織業</h3>
<p>歐戰時期、日人向華經濟發展、致上海·青島等日紗廠林立、然朝鮮爲其屬地、因政治力之關係、故紡織業僅在釜山設有朝鮮紡績會社、其他各地尙付闕如、最近朝鮮紡績會社有增加紡錠二萬枚、織機五百台之計劃一他如東洋棉花會社東洋紡績會社及合同紡績會社、均在木浦等處覓地設廠、故日本紡績企業家漸向朝鮮發展、考其原因、（一）工銀低廉、（二）朝鮮需要甚大、能具相當市塲、（三）有織物移入稅之制度等、且就原料一端、向來平壤以南、年産原棉七萬担左右、當有充分開拓之可能、頗能適合發展紡織業之條件、一旦朝鮮紡績業成效良好、則在日本内地之棉業景况不佳時、或海外輸出困難時、大可調劑而緩和之也、</p>
<h3>絲茶美銷發動絲價激漲</h3>

<h3>祁紅茶市盛極一時</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、祁門浮梁等路紅茶英莊進意濃厚、全市成交二千二百八十九箱、頂盤開出二百二十五两、市價極爲堅挺、至綠茶市面依然疲滯、温州·寗波·遂安·各路貨、全市均無交易云、</p>

<p>婺邑新茶、自各號議盤開秤、清華等處售八十元、北鄉各村户茶均堅照此盤價、有增無减、雙方相持、迄未開秤茶號以山户所望太奢、紛向西南两鄉搜辦、截至今日止各號進茶、僅只百餘担至數十擔、態度甚消極、其故因贛河近正閙共、交通阻斷、前晚（十四0思口某茶棧婺莊又被盜刧、市上現洋供不敷求且多不敢赴屯景運辦兼之食米飛漲、城鄉存糧告匱、茶號鑒茲環境、咸抱觀望、間有少數擬就此收塲者、有此原因、故日來東北各鄉茶市、愈趨冷淡云、</p>
<h3>修水茶價前跌後漲</h3>
<p>修水（即寗州）爲贛省産茶要區、每年製銷洋莊紅茶、不下五六萬箱今歲修地本和茶號、及婺源·營口·粤東·帮益源等號、均進山開辦、熱閙不减往年、雖茶棧放匯縮緊其中大半茶號、俱與錢莊直接貸欵、銀根不慮竭蹶、首字新茶開秤、每斤售價四百文、較舊見减二百文、嗣因天氣晴好、出茶頗優、各號需要轉亟、每斤市價提漲至六百文、統扯盤價、均比上年見低、現各號新茶、均巳進齊除首字箱茶啟運外、二字又巳成堆如天時做好、子茶出新、號家頗有進胃云、</p>
<h3>糧食新粉略現軟象</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、因天時轉佳、晴光巳放遠期人心、巳呈軟象、至本年麥收、依照脚地而言、可望豐收、如在收汎時、得能長晴、則各路到貨必湧、人心之不佳、即基於此、故六七月份大致小去七厘半、八九月份則小去一分餘、迨至下午開盤、以天時又復密雲滿佈、氣候亦未轉暖、且洋麥報價、曾回漲六七九角不等、故大部分之内地帮、心思仍緊、售户縮手、致各月份開價、漸趨緊俏、觀此種盤旋之態、必須新麥收獲後、方能解除也、結果五七月份較前日微好二厘半、六九月份各小五厘、八十月份未動、</p>
<h3>小麥多頭巳有出擋</h3>
<p>昨日期麥人心大虚、内地多頭亦紛紛出檔、故六月份最低到四两五錢一分、七月份四两四錢、</p>
<p>八月份四两四錢三分、較前日計回跌三四分不等九十月份亦有一二分不等、迨至下午開盤以外行補空將動又復稍見回佳、觀此種局面如麥收果佳、將來終看跌風也結果六月份較前日小二分、七九月份各小一分、八月份不動、十月份好一分、現麥以標準見軟、新貨又接起客户心思略軟、較前日喊價小去二分、開清江浦麥南宿州蚌埠麥五两一錢半、共開四千包云、</p>
<h3>洋米初跌後定</h3>
<p>昨日洋米續有新到、江北帮巳緩辦、祗有長江一帶及浙省與内地去化、人心甚軟、價立小一角小後客帮辦儧轉濃、交易轉旺、價亦回好五分、結果比前市小去五六分、成交數以小絞爲主、價十四元五角半至三角二分、計八千包、又糙米二千包、價十三元六角八分至五角半大絞一千包、價十四元四角至三角二分、一號西貢一千包、價十五元三角、敏當一千五百包價十四元六角半至四角半、安南粳五百包、價十六元四角半云</p>
<h3>疋頭月華絨紛紛到滬</h3>
<p>因有加稅之說···提早運申</p>

<p>戲劇協社之威尼斯商人、轟傅滬上者久矣、最近始在中央大會堂公演、余於上星期日、驅車往觀至則來賓濟濟、座無隙地、是劇之受人歡迎於此足見一斑矣當劇未開幕前、縈纏於余腦海中者、厥惟中國舞臺上演外國劇本、未免失去原劇精神、或流爲疇昔盛行之新茶花就是吾等不中不西、非驢非馬之怪劇然鑒於戲劇協社迭次公演之成績、曁是劇籌備之耗費、余度此番公演、諒不無卓越之處、供人欣賞惟以莎翁原本情節之離奇寓意之深刻、心中不免懸懸、未識戲劇協社諸君、有無此種魄力、傅出原劇之神、於是疑竇莫釋而渴望該劇開演之心更急如星火俄而全塲電炬齊熄、幃幕徐啓、眼簾所觸全係十六世紀意大利景像演員之一舉一動、一顰一笑、幾靡不吻合爾時情景、較諸在校誦莎氏劇本時、心中虚搆之影像、倍覺親切、即未讀莎氏原劇不諳意大利情况者、觀此諒亦不難引起一種物殊之愉快也、</p>

<p>文藝家的故事（二）·平</p>
<h3>戀愛狂的貝多芬</h3>
<p>貝多芬在耳朶漸漸有病時、還是熱烈去戀愛某伯爵的姑娘、</p>
<p>「美的天使呀、我們的至高至貴的生命呀我們的一切呀、」</p>
<p>他在寄給這位少女的話裏都有包含着如此熱情的話語他送給這位少女而滿是燃燒的戀心之作品、就是非常有名的「阿達拉依達」、做這個曲時、爲了要十二分的顯露他的火燒似的熱心、就常常去剌他的胸部、</p>
<p>譜的墨水尙未乾盡時、剛有叫做勃爾脫的友人來看他他突然將此譜交給勃爾脫、並且對他說、請看罷、完工是完工了、量是完一不能中意、火爐的確是不可少的、我就燒了牠罷、</p>
<p>勃爾脫看了這個曲同時就唱起來、果感到非常情熱、胸部也突然緊張而進入於可怖的興奮狀態、</p>
<p>於是阿特拉依達、也就免去了當煤炭燃燒了的運命、</p>
<p>但是、就是拿了這個名曲也不能使這位伯爵的姑娘想到自己是這位年老而耳聾的愛人</p>
<p>姑娘也終於祇是去做了一個很平凡的男子的妻子、</p>
<p>貝多芬又和美女瑪麗壁克蘭爾發生戀愛、並且當時勃美德納女士也完全動了戀心、勃美德納女士是和哥德戀愛過、所以是很有名的女性、</p>
<h3>同性愛的兩個詩人</h3>
<p>法國高蹈派的天才詩人拉波和凡爾侖的初次見面是在他十六歲的時候、但他在十五歲時即巳送了幾首詩給凡爾侖要他作批評、當時凡爾侖就驚嘆他的技巧和微妙的感覺、都能在詩的深處微微的表現着這些作品、即在後年的他的作品中也是放了異彩的</p>
<p>拉波是個極美麗的漂亮少年、所以凡爾侖一見了他不單是驚嘆了他的天才、並且還愛上了他的美貌、</p>
<p>當時凡爾侖即介紹了許多高蹈派詩人給他、於是拉波就一躍而爲詩壇的聞人、</p>
<p>同時凡爾侖的身體靈魂也完全被拉波的美麗的面相所迷、而二人此後也就沉淪於深刻的同性戀愛、凡爾的腦袋裏祇有拉波、他的一切歡喜和悲哀、也都投入到拉波的美麗裏去、</p>
<p>他倆一起到比利時、到英國、也隨隨便便的到過各個地方去、一八七三年他倆就停留在比利時的白拉賽、有一次在酒排間裏飲酒過夜、結果都喝得大醉、於是由劇烈的口角而至用武力鬥爭、</p>
<p>當時拉波就想和凡爾侖離開、但凡爾侖是不願意的、在凡爾侖看來、要得拉波分離、即像是一切黑暗的就要到來、拉波却堅持着要分開、把凡爾侖推開到另一方面的門時、凡爾侖因酒失去了理性而陷於自暴自棄、突然的將手槍對準了拉波開了二槍、凡爾侖到那時頭腦才開始添晣、目睹着拉波巳染滿了紅血而跌倒在地上、</p>
<p>拉波送進了醫院、而同時凡爾侖也就被捕了、結果凡爾侖以謀殺未遂罪而宣告了二年的監禁、他此後的二年就祗得呻吟於牢獄之中、</p>
<p>凡爾侖在獄中寫了無言之歌、而對這部詩集的校正也就在獄中、拉波的傷痕也不久就痊愈、在凡爾侖出獄後他倆有時也有信扎來往、</p>
<p>某晚在月白深夜的納加河堤上、他倆又因酒亂而爭論、拉波忽然打了凡爾侖一記巴掌就跑了、於是從此就未會過、拉波的一生也和凡爾侖同樣的過了非常少有的生活他和凡爾侖分别後就沒有在歐洲見到他、</p>
<p>泥醉者的船、是他的有名的詩集、好像詩中的文句一樣、他離開了歐洲的文明、到了未開化的非洲去祗有有過一個商人、說在巴爾幹曾見過拉波但此後他的消息也就杳然、</p>
<h3>夫婦音樂家｜｜休門</h3>
<p>「有情人總成眷屬、」這是一句多有意義的語句呀、休門夫婦的能夠結爲夫婦、也是經過了種種困難的、第一克拉拉的父親對他倆的結合、在無論什麽理由上都不肯加以許可、不但不許可、並且還站在極力反對的地位、但他倆究竟因有「愛」的力量、所以還是得了很圓滿的結果、</p>
<p>一八四○年九月十二日、克拉拉在公會席上演奏了貝多芬的短曲「蘇多納」後、京辭了少女的舞台而去結婚、二人在拉波基希附近希納非不脫的某敎堂裏、被祝福和戀情所圍繞而舉行滿露着幸福的結婚式、</p>
<p>羅勃脫·休門在結婚前就常常讚美克拉拉說、「别時詩人雖是做了詩、自身却並不是詩、而克拉拉自身就是詩呢、」他倆的結婚、好似被所有的藝術家、去祝福、所以完全是幸福的、</p>
<p>羅勃脫·休門是德國近代的天才作曲家、而克拉拉實在是個有美和情熱、並且一工发的音樂都好像給以春的生命似的鋼琴家、他倆眞是再好也沒有的一對兒呢、</p>
<p>音樂家以一八四○年叫做休門的「歌曲之年、」而休門也就在這一年和克拉拉醉心於戀愛、因此、作曲的發表也以那年爲最多、他倆結婚後非但在德國的各重要都市、就是荷蘭俄國奥地利亞等間、也常有他倆去演奏的踪跡、在這個期間、也許因爲作曲的過於勞心、所以休門的精神突然呈了異狀、一八五六年他就死别了克拉拉、</p>
<p>克拉拉一方面是個音樂家、而他方面並且還是個賢妻良母的典型、她是一八九六年逝去的、和休門葬在一起、</p>

<h3>第四十章德意志文學的古典時代</h3>
<p>『浮士德』的這個簡短的說明連原本的詩也沒有提及、在這里須要記得那戲曲全體是比『失樂園』長得多、各行有着音樂的潑溂和活力·意義·以及性格描寫、而世界文學史上長到可以和這相比的任何作品無可並比的、『浮士德』業於今日的我們、也是重要到同年老的哥德擱筆時一樣的、</p>
<p>將席勒爾引到威馬爾去、又使那和世俗底事情有過一番頗苦的奮鬭的青年獲得耶拿大學的歷史敎授的地位者即哥德、比哥德小十歲的席勒爾是以散文劇的『强盜』『卡白爾斯和戀愛』首先問世、在其中、十九世紀的新的家庭底波爾喬亞悲劇達於極點、這些戲曲是用散文寫的、有着優美·崇高的革命底的結構和性格描寫的力、而且築了在散文的悲劇底對話的近代藝術的基礎、然而這好像雪萊的初期的詩似的、有着亂暴的、缺乏節制的所在、通曉歷史和康德哲學的正在成熟的這作家、當其短的生涯的餘時、從事於韻文的歷史劇及悲劇的開發、在耶拿及威馬爾、生出那構成摩利爾及赫伯爾間的劇文中最重要的體系的數種戲曲來、即『唐卡羅斯』『奥爾良的處女』『瑪麗斯圖亞特』『威廉退爾』及『發楞斯泰因』的三部曲等、至於近年、席勒爾的戲曲雖然都還流行於舞台上、却有些落了聲價了、自然主義者是寗取初期的散文劇的、對於席勒爾的修辭、對於他那時時發現而在『奥爾良的處女』中尤甚的感傷性的峻烈的批評、成爲普通的事了、縱使如此、戲曲中最美者『威廉退爾』並且『發楞斯泰因』的全部｜而這於哲學底詩也相等地恰當｜依然是有活力的、劇底的生動的東西、</p>
<p>和席勒爾的死一同、德意志文學的嚴密的古典底時代可以說是告終了、哥德則一直活到一八三二年、然而當那時、羅曼派早巳完畢了那工作、七月革命巳經終了、海湼巳經逃到意大利去了、新時代差不多正在午晝時哩、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The British Political Situation Can Be Temporarily Stabilized Again</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of excessive industrial production leading to a sudden increase in unemployment is common to all major countries. The political instability caused by the inability to solve the sudden increase in unemployment is also a common concern for all countries today. However, the issue of unemployment in Britain has been a problem for nearly ten years. After the difficult period of 1921, the number of unemployed gradually decreased, but later, due to the major coal mine strike, unemployment greatly increased again. Recently, due to the widespread impact of commercial decline, it has naturally increased even more. Therefore, the unemployment problem in Britain is more difficult to solve than in other countries. Successive cabinets and financial authorities have been troubled by this problem and have fallen. When the Labour Party regained power, it immediately focused on this point, declaring that it would find the best solution. However, in this kind of plummeting situation, even the most brilliant economists feel helpless. Moreover, the Labour Party's power in Parliament does not occupy a majority. If they want to propose a more radical solution, they will be opposed by the right-wing. If they want to proceed slowly, they will be attacked by the left-wing. Their predicament has long been revealed. Two months ago, the Conservative Party once raised an impeachment motion on this issue. The situation of the cabinet was already very precarious. Fortunately, the Liberal Party did not want to hinder the government's work at a time when the Hague Conference was in a state of emergency, so it rose up and cooperated with the Labour Party to dispel it. The government was able to turn danger into safety. Now, cabinet member Mosley, because his relief policy was not adopted, also raised a motion to impeach the government at a special Labour Party conference. The Conservative Party did not want to overthrow the MacDonald government at a time when the Indian issue was serious, so it again dispelled Mosley's motion. Thus, the Labour Party government can barely survive for a while. The Conservative Party has long wanted to take over the Labour Party government. Now, instead of seeing it as an opportunity to gain power, it is giving it support, and can be called, along with the Liberal Party, one that can take the overall situation into consideration. However, this support is probably very temporary. If the unemployment problem cannot be solved, the cabinet will not be stable. It is like a person suffering from an illness. If long-term medical treatment does not cure it, they will definitely think of changing to another doctor to treat it. Because the desire for a cure is so eager, they will definitely seek a quick effect. If repeated medication does not cure it, it indicates disappointment, and the thought of changing doctors arises. In fact, if the illness is difficult to treat, even if the doctor is changed repeatedly, it will be useless, and it will become increasingly difficult to treat.</p>

<p>Domestic Urgent Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>National Government Orders Northern People</h3>
<p>To Refuse to Use Paper Money Issued by Yan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 23rd, saying: "The rebel Yan Xishan has betrayed the central government and undermined unification. The government has previously issued a clear order to arrest him. Now that national law has not been upheld, the rebel is entrenched in Taiyuan and is wantonly levying taxes and extorting money from the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The tyranny reaches,诸如加收特捐·预借田赋·截留国税·劫夺赈粮·摊购烟土·强征军实之事, 日有所闻. the matters of charging special donations, pre-borrowing land taxes, intercepting national taxes, robbing relief grains, apportioning opium purchases, and forcibly conscripting military supplies are heard daily. In the past, Shanxi Province alone issued more than 60 million yuan of paper money indiscriminately, harming merchants and people, and the public was universally angry. The government is preparing to find a way to provide relief, but the regulations for reorganizing the Shanxi provincial financial bonds have just been promulgated, and the rebel took advantage of them to plot rebellion. On the one hand, he raised money in the name of raising money, and issued banknotes. On the other hand, he absorbed cash and transported it all to Shanxi, which caused the financial situation in Tianjin and the northern provinces to become more chaotic, and the people to suffer more. Recently, as the end of the road is approaching, he still does not care about the grievances of the people. The number of banknotes issued in succession in recent months has increased even more, and a large number of military tickets have been issued in order to make a clean sweep. Such a heartless and mad search for wealth is endless, and the poor are dying. How can they bear it? The government is concerned about the people of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Chahar, and Suiyuan, who have been in dire straits for a long time, and all hope for relief. Now that the rebel has been defeated repeatedly, the time for his escape is not far away. He is collecting cash to prepare for a distant voyage, and from now on, it will be even worse than before. Fearing that merchants and people are ignorant and have been deceived by the warlords and are guilty of aiding the rebels, this order is hereby issued to earnestly persuade and guide them. In the future, for all kinds of banknotes, bonds, and various notes issued by the rebel, they must learn from the past and resolutely refuse them in order to curb the evil atmosphere and promote justice. This order. (Special dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

Japan has no right to obstruct this. The Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Uemura, also denied that this was the case. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Northeast Strictly Prevents Redization</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The Northeast Political Affairs Committee recently issued strict orders to local government offices to prevent redization. The penal regulations stipulate that those who mastermind and propagate redization will be sentenced to life imprisonment, those who knowingly participate in the movement will be sentenced to more than ten years of imprisonment, and those who protect or assist redization propagandists will be sentenced to one to ten years of imprisonment. Recently, graduates from Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow and Communist universities have been under the command of Soviet Russia, sneaking into northern Manchuria to propagate redization. Since the Sino-Russian conflict last year, various Soviet Russian organs have gradually invaded northern Manchuria with unstoppable momentum. Therefore, the Chinese side, under the pretext of thoroughly cracking down on its own nationals, has adopted this preemptive and hostile attitude. The Northeast Political Affairs Committee has also strictly ordered Chinese government offices in the Sino-Russian border area of Manzhouli to pay special attention to Russians residing in Chinese territory and Chinese returning from Russia.

Aren't these views completely contrary to the facts? Disabled comrades, the baton you have given me is a symbol of my obedience to the spirit of victory and the will of the nation.</p>
<p>Austrian Heimwehr Party</p>
<h3>Attempt to Usurp Power</h3>
<p>Issues Ultimatum to the Government</p>
<p>Opposes the Disarmament of All Parties</p>
<p>Long-Standing Incompatibility with the Socialist Party</p>
<p>Internal Strife Feared to be Inevitable</p>
<p>National, Vienna, 22nd - Austrian Manager Schober said that most parties in the country have armed organizations, and the Socialist and Heimwehr parties are especially at odds with each other, and there is always the risk of internal strife. Therefore, he plans to disarm all parties uniformly. The leaders of the Heimwehr's self-defense corps, Steidle and Pfrimer, personally delivered an ultimatum to the Prime Minister, demanding, in addition to maintaining arms, to appoint members of the Heimwehr as Minister of the Interior and Vienna Police Superintendent, and to disarm all Socialist Party guards, etc., with a deadline for reply by Friday. The release of this news shocked the country. However, it is heard that Schober is still determined to implement his original proposal, and the cabinet also believes that the Heimwehr's ultimatum has no value for discussion and unanimously decided not to pay attention to it. Therefore, the future changes in the situation will depend on the second step of the Heimwehr leaders. As for the two parties, they are now at daggers drawn, actively preparing. The Socialist Party leader has notified party members to remain calm, but if the Heimwehr attempts to usurp power, it will do its best to resist, and said that although the party also opposes the government's plan to disarm all parties, it will only use methods permitted by the constitution and does not want to use threats of force like the Heimwehr. However, the government is still optimistic about this and believes that it will not lead to a civil war between the two parties. As for the newspapers, even the extremely conservative Agrarian League organ newspaper has criticized the Heimwehr's ultimatum as reckless and crude. Also, the newspapers of the Christian Socialist Party, while expressing sympathy for the self-defense corps's goal of maintaining arms, do not approve of the methods it uses.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 22nd - German political circles are taking a calm approach to the events in Vienna, because the Austrian cabinet has unanimously agreed that Schober will ignore the Heimwehr's ultimatum and believes that there will be a majority in parliament to support the government. Therefore, the Heimwehr leaders will think twice before initiating a civil war. If they want to resort to arms, they will have the army and police as their enemies.</p>

<h3>Issue of Command Authority</h3>
<p>Japanese Military's Attitude Remains Tough</p>
<p>Decision to Convene a Council of Senior Officials</p>
<p>Telecom News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The issue of command authority, which has been hanging between the government and the military and has not yet been resolved, has resulted in Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Minister of the Navy Emaki agreeing to proceed largely according to the established policy, regardless of whether the Chief of the Naval Staff resigns. However, the military's attitude remains tough and unchanged, and it has decided to convene a council of senior officials to present its views, establish a national defense policy, and discuss future issues. Telecommunications News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - The Japanese government hopes to complete the ratification procedures for the London Naval Treaty by the beginning of the summer vacation, that is, before July 20. The army, while superficially adopting a bystander attitude, secretly supports the military's disapproval. However, the army's views are also inconsistent. Some hope that the current cabinet will collapse, some say that in order to fundamentally solve the problem, even if one or two cabinets collapse, it is acceptable, and some say that the current arms reduction treaty is actually a great success for Japan. As a result, if the military is tough to the end, it may cast a shadow on the general public like the army's two divisions.</p>

<h3>Appeal Judgment on the Gao Ying Case (Continued)</h3>
<p>(B) Regarding the matter of dereliction of duty, after investigation, Chen had repeatedly sent letters to Gao Ying, stating that there were four Chinese laborers going to the United States and entrusting him to receive and lead them ashore, promising a substantial reward. After the Chinese laborers arrived in the United States, it was discovered that their passports were altered and they were using the name of the abolished Mexican consulate, so they were sent back. These details had been repeatedly confessed by Gao Ying. Chen also admitted that the letters were in his own handwriting. What should be investigated now is whether Gao Ying's acceptance of Chen’s offer, and receiving Chinese laborers to go ashore, were within the scope of his duties. According to Article 1 of the Regulations on the Duties of Consulates, sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although it only stipulates that the duty of a consul is to develop domestic commerce and comfort overseas merchants, the term "overseas merchants" here should be interpreted in a broad sense, and all merchants and people residing abroad should be included. This is evidenced by the provisions of Articles 8, 9, and 10 of the same regulations, which refer to "domestic citizens," "overseas residents," or "overseas merchants," which makes this clear. Furthermore, receiving people ashore is a kind of comforting behavior, and it is also the starting point for comforting overseas residents. According to the official letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "The duty of a consul is to protect overseas residents, so although there are no explicit regulations regarding receiving people upon arrival, it should be done if there is a practical necessity." Therefore, receiving Chinese laborers ashore is undoubtedly within the scope of consular duties, which is beyond doubt. The argument that the duty of a consul is only to protect overseas merchants is a distortion of the truth and is difficult to accept. However, whether Gao Ying promised Chen's request is a matter of fact. According to Chen Yiyi, "Gao Ying had already agreed and replied in a letter, but the letter no longer exists" (see the investigation record of March of the 18th year). Although this is a one-sided statement, when considering the letters from Chen Yiyi to Gao Ying, the initial statement was, "Now there are three or four people who want to go to the United States. Can you obtain diplomatic passports for them, and can you receive them ashore? If so, I will reward you one thousand for each person, and I will only take one-quarter." Then he said, "If you agree, please send a telegram quickly. (omitted) If there is no telegram by May 15, then I will have them depart first. (omitted) You will get one-quarter, and I will take it after they land." Finally, he said, "I received a telegram in Guangdong saying that they have boarded the ship and have to go. I received a letter back in Shanghai saying that the Mexican name cannot be used. Fortunately, only one person used it. I don't know what the result will be. The money could have been three thousand, but it was changed to two thousand four. I have sent a letter asking them to increase it to two thousand six. If they have landed safely, please let me know by telegram" (all the above letters are in Chen Yiyi's file). This is sufficient to show that Gao Ying first agreed, and then, knowing that Chen Yiyi had misused the name of the abolished Mexican consulate, he sent a letter to stop him and informed him that the Mexican name could not be used. Moreover, judging from the consultation on the amount of the reward in Chen Yiyi's subsequent letters, it is even more proof that Gao Ying promised a bribe. Furthermore, Gao Ying had told Consul General Gong one day before the Chinese laborers arrived in the United States that four Chinese people would arrive in port on the two Belgian ships the next morning, two of whom were his private servants, and asked Gong to write a letter to the immigration officer, allowing them to land. He had also personally gone to Sun Yuan's residence and secretly told him about the matter, asking for his assistance. These details had been reported by Consul General Gong to the former Minister to the United States, Shi. Sun Yuan also said during the investigation, "Gao Ying told me about this matter, saying that Chen Yiyi had asked him to do it, and he could get some reward, but he did not specify three thousand." Consul General Gong's report also matched. Considering all of the above, and comparing the evidence, it is undeniable that Gao Ying promised a bribe for official acts, but it was not a promise of a bribe for an act that violated his duties.</p>
<p>The above is an explanation of the determination of the facts of the crime in this case and the evidence on which it is based. Now, we should further study whether the original judgment was appropriate, and whether the appeal is justified. First, regarding the opium part, Gao Ying and Gao Liao should both be found guilty of aiding and abetting the attempted sale of opium, as mentioned earlier. If their criminal acts occurred after the implementation of the New Anti-Smoking Law, there would be nothing wrong with the original judgment finding Gao Liao guilty of transporting opium and Gao Ying guilty of aiding and abetting the transportation of opium. Because Article 6 of the law does not have any restrictions on the location of transportation activities, it includes importing from foreign countries to China, exporting from China to foreign countries, or transporting from foreign countries to foreign countries. However, the criminal acts of Gao Liao and others actually occurred before the implementation of the New Anti-Smoking Law (the New Anti-Smoking Law was promulgated and implemented on July 25 of the 18th year). According to Article 1 of the Old Anti-Smoking Law and Article 271 of the Criminal Code, the transportation situation is limited to importing from foreign countries to China or exporting from China to foreign countries. If it is transported from foreign countries to foreign countries, there is no clear provision for punishment. The opium carried by Gao Liao was transported from British Hong Kong to the United States. According to Article 1 of the Criminal Code, there is no legal basis to apply the New Anti-Smoking Law to punish the crime of transportation. It is inappropriate for the original judgment to still consider it a crime of transporting opium. Secondly, Article 2 of the New Anti-Smoking Law adopts the principle of applying new laws retroactively, stipulating that "during the period of implementation of this law, the penalties for violating the smoking ban should be based on the provisions of this law." This is an exception to the principle of leniency in Article 2 of the Criminal Code, so regardless of whether the crime was committed before the implementation of this law, the crime should be judged and punished according to this law, and there is no room for applying the lighter penalty of the old law. It is inappropriate for the original judgment not to punish according to the New Anti-Smoking Law, and to cite the provisions of the proviso in Article 2 of the Criminal Code, comparing the severity of the old and new penalties and using the lighter penalty. Thirdly, according to Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Crime of Party Members Breaking Oaths, "Party members who violate their oaths and commit illegal acts shall be punished by adding one level or more to the penalty according to the Criminal Code according to the circumstances." The so-called Criminal Code refers to the ordinary Criminal Code. If the crime is based on special criminal law, this provision cannot be used to add a level of punishment. It is inappropriate for the original judgment not to consider Gao Ying guilty of a crime under the special criminal law, the Anti-Smoking Law, and to increase the punishment according to the Regulations on the Crime of Party Members. Fourthly, Sun Yuan was actually a direct and important accomplice in the opium sale, as mentioned earlier, and there is sufficient proof of this. However, the original judgment considered that the suspicion of the crime could not be proven, and ordered acquittal according to Article 316 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which is inappropriate. Regarding the part about dereliction of duty, Gao Ying can only be found guilty of promising a bribe for official acts under Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. The original judgment considered that he violated Article 129, Paragraph 1 of the same law, which is promising a bribe for acts that violate his duties, which is inappropriate. Fifthly, the 2,299 cans of opium discovered in this case were all detained and disposed of by the US Customs. Only two cans were transferred to the case, so only these two cans can be confiscated. However, the original judgment generally declared them confiscated and destroyed, which is inappropriate. Sixthly, regarding the second point, the prosecutor's appeal pointed out the part of the original judgment that acquitted Sun Yuan, which should be considered reasonable and does not need to be discussed further. Although Gao Ying and Gao Liao's appeal denied the facts of the crime, which is not acceptable, their attack on the inappropriateness of the original judgment cannot be said to be completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>In summary, in accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the original judgment is revoked and a new judgment is made. Gao Ying and Sun Yuan should each be doubly punished for the crime of government officials aiding and abetting the attempted sale of opium, in accordance with Article 9, Article 44, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code, and Articles 3, 6, 12, and 15 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Gao Liao should also be punished for the crime of aiding and abetting the attempted sale of opium, in accordance with Article 9, Article 44, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Criminal Code, and Articles 2, 6, and 12 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Gao Ying should be punished by increasing the original sentence by one-third for the crime of promising a bribe for official acts, in accordance with Article 2, Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, National Government Training Order No. 160, Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on the Crime of Party Members Breaking Oaths, and Article 5 of the Special Criminal Law Penalty Calculation Standard Regulations (although the penalty in Article 140, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law is lighter than the penalty in Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, after adding one level, it is heavier than adding one-third according to the Criminal Code. According to Article 3 of the Criminal Law Implementation Regulations, separate increases should be made, and the heavier or lighter penalties should still be applied according to the Criminal Code). In addition, the execution of the penalties for the defendants should be determined in accordance with Article 70, Paragraphs 1 and 5 of the Criminal Law Implementation Regulations. The defendants should also be allowed to offset their detention and convert to imprisonment in accordance with Article 64, Article 55, Paragraphs 2 to 5 of the Criminal Code. The two cans of opium should be confiscated and destroyed in accordance with Article 14 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The judgment is made as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>Du Fuyao, Sun Xiyan, and Zhu Jun, prosecutors of this court, have appeared in court successively to perform the duties of prosecutor in this case. The appellate court in this case is the Supreme Court. If the parties are not satisfied, they should file an appeal with this court in writing within ten days after the judgment is served. (End)</p>

<h3>The Defense of Xuzhou is Extremely Solid</h3>
<p>Wan Dianzun Passes Xuzhou, Relieving Beijing</p>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence, the central army advances and repeatedly reports victories. The rear defense and security of Xuzhou are very important. Yesterday, Shen Maosheng, director of the Second Army Group's garrison, convened a meeting of Peng Zhongkuang, battalion commander of the military police; Yang Wei, county magistrate of Tongshan; and Qiao Shizhao, director of the Public Security Bureau. It was decided to implement the following separately: (1) Patrol matters: The military police battalion will send two squads of soldiers, together with two squads of police officers from the Public Security Bureau and the Public Security Brigade, divided into two groups, to assemble and patrol at the military police battalion and the Public Security Bureau starting from the 20th. (2) Inspection matters: The military police battalion will send soldiers and the Public Security Bureau will send police officers, divided into two groups inside and outside the city every day, to inspect hotels and restaurants. (3) Rural joint defense: The county government will issue orders to the district chiefs to handle it. (4) Arresting bandits: The Public Security Brigade is responsible for handling it. (5) Management of wounded soldiers: Liu, the commander-in-chief, has been requested to assign wounded officers to manage them nearby. (6) Inspecting officers and soldiers: Any officers and soldiers without symbols or badges will be arrested and dealt with by the military police battalion. (7) Secret investigation of spies: The military police battalion and the Public Security Bureau will handle it together. At present, the defense of Xuzhou is extremely solid and the security is very good.</p>
<p>After Wan Dianzun was captured, Liu Zhi sent someone to escort him from Guide. However, Wan suddenly tried to escape from the vehicle midway. He was chased by the guards for several miles and recaptured. When he arrived in Xuzhou, he was escorted to the headquarters and dealt with. The guards tied him under the train with his hands behind his back. Wan was wearing a small blue satin jacket, dark blue single trousers, green Zhigong wool shoes, and blue thread socks. His face was pale. Many people from the headquarters surrounded him and asked questions. According to Wan, "I am obeying the orders of my commander-in-chief and cannot help but fight." When asked why he tried to escape, Wan had no answer. For the sake of treating prisoners with leniency, Chiang Kai-shek ordered people to untie him, put him on the train, and sent Shao Lizi to comfort him. However, when Wan saw Shao, he immediately bent his knees and asked him to intercede. Shao urged him to get up, and Wan finally got up and entered the room, still guarded by two soldiers. It is said that Wan is twenty-nine years old, a native of Luoyang. Judging from his attitude, his thinking seems quite simple. (21st)</p>
<h3>The Phenomenon of Rice Shortage in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Wuhu correspondence, although Anhui Province is known as a rice-producing area, it has suffered from years of disasters, and the people's granaries have long been empty. In addition, military campaigns have repeatedly requisitioned food and fodder in Anhui Province, resulting in insufficient food for the people for a long time. Last winter's heavy snow forced many poor people in various counties to survive on vegetables. Therefore, the provincial government had a resolution to prohibit the export of rice and grain, but it still needs to circulate within the province. Unexpectedly, since this spring, the northern and southern divisions stationed in Anhui Province have again purchased large quantities of military rice in Anhui Province for export. When the season of crop shortage arrives, the people's food is in a state of panic. The commander-in-chief's headquarters ordered the purchase of 50,000 shi of military rice, and the divisions sent people to Anhui to collect it. Unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to speculate, causing rice prices to skyrocket and radishes to disappear. Hungry people are restless, and interception is heard every day. In addition, the upstream Jiangxi rice has also been banned. The people's food on both sides of the Huai River and the Yangtze River has always relied on Jiangxi Province for assistance, but the source has been cut off, and the phenomenon of having money but no rice has emerged. Therefore, people have requested the authorities to stop searching for and buying military rice in Anhui, and on the other hand, to raise funds to purchase foreign rice and open up public sales for assistance. Even in Xuancheng, Nanling, and Fanchang counties in southern Anhui, which are most famous for producing rice, the situation is the same. It is unprecedented for Anhui people to eat foreign rice. The provincial government has also repeatedly sent telegrams to the central government based on public opinion, requesting that the people's food be taken into consideration and that the Military Supply Department and the Garrison Headquarters be notified. If military rice still needs to be purchased in the future, it should be purchased and transported to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Ministry of Military Affairs stating that the Military Supply Department and the Garrison Headquarters had been ordered to investigate and handle the matter. The provincial government has now telegraphed the county governments to inform them. As for the purchase of foreign rice in Shanghai by various counties for the purpose of public sales, more than 20,000 shi have been imported and transferred from Wuhu successively. People are still sending people to Shanghai to place orders. The lack of food for the people can be seen from this. (21st)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express Letter</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance decided to implement the abolition of transit duties and the implementation of special consumption taxes. However, in order to find ways to prepare for compensation after the abolition of transit duties, it specially ordered the finance commissioners of each province to formulate plans and compile a forecast table of product tax rates and send them to the Ministry for planning purposes. After receiving the order, the Anhui Finance Commissioner Lou Fu immediately organized a special consumption tax committee and held its inaugural meeting today. In the future, meetings will be held once a week to jointly study the matter. In addition to the 12 members designated by the Finance Commissioner's Office, including section chiefs Li Linggui, Feng Zubei, Bao Geng, and Wu Mengchang, the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce and the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce also recommended She Ceqin, Tao Yutang, Li Dachu, and Wei Bincheng to participate in the meetings as observers.</p>

<p>The Wuhu National Theater had a conflict with the staff of the county party headquarters, resulting in injuries to four people, including Lei Biji and Hong Yunqiao. Two people from the theater were also slightly injured. In addition to ordering the theater to suspend business, the municipal and county party headquarters also resolved yesterday to telegraph the provincial party headquarters and the provincial government to severely punish the main culprits and protect the party affairs workers. In the future, all theaters should give party members preferential treatment by selling tickets at half price upon presentation of their credentials. A letter and telegram were also sent to the Electric Light Company to charge party members half price for electricity. Furthermore, all newspapers were ordered not to publish advertisements about the case.</p>
<p>The provincial government issued a notice to all counties to abolish the previously established autonomous preparatory branches.

<p>The municipal office previously established a relief home and a vagrant work training center to accommodate beggars. However, because merchants and people opposed the poor management of the center, they stopped paying relief donations. The center was forced to announce its closure today and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau not to send beggars to the center again (22nd).</p>

<p>The Use of the Housing Police Donation and Special Donation. The county court of this county has not yet been established due to the issue of the court's location. The Pujiao Temple and Qianjin Temple houses, where the Public Security Bureau is prepared to move to work, have now been repaired and are nearing completion. However, the repair and relocation costs have been repeatedly raised through donations from local groups at meetings. Lawyers have determined that 1,500 yuan, 2,000 yuan of interest from the remaining funds of the municipal and rural public service items, and the estimated amount are not sufficient. Later, it was decided at a meeting to collect a month's housing police donation in this city. If it is still not enough, it is planned to have the public groups recognize and approve the case. Now, the county government has issued a notice that this special housing police donation must be paid in full in May to speed up the process.</p>
<p>Ye Xie Asks for a Police Team to be Stationed for Deterrence in front of the Shengzi Temple. After the case of the robbery and murder of a police officer by lake bandits in front of the Shengzi Temple a few days ago, the public groups and local people in Ye Xie Town, which is the closest, were deeply worried about bandit attacks due to the weak defense. Recently, the county government received a quick postal telegram from the town requesting that a police team be sent to the town to deter bandits. According to the report from the person who came, there were many rumors in the town and everyone was panicked. Therefore, the county government immediately dispatched 20 police officers to the town overnight to deter bandits and reassure the people.</p>

<p>Unlawful Clerk Removed from Office for Investigation. Qian Jingzhi, the former director of the Zhou Shu Township Administrative Bureau, was appointed as a patrol officer in the Taicang River and Bridge Public Security Bureau after being accused of being removed from office. He was later dismissed due to an incident. Recently, through the introduction of Zhang Pengcai, the Party Reorganization Committee of the County, he was appointed as a clerk in the Second Section of the County Public Security Bureau. After working for three days, he was ordered by the director of the bureau, Zou Wu'er, to go to Chenmu and Shipai townships to secretly investigate smoking and gambling. Unexpectedly, the clerk's ambition broke out, and he extorted money under various pretexts, amounting to a large sum. Soon, the gentry of the two townships learned about it and immediately filed a complaint with the County Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation. After receiving the complaint, Director Zou interrogated the clerk in detail. The clerk replied that he had taken this measure because of poverty. Director Zou immediately ordered his removal from office and awaited investigation. The Social Achievement Exhibition of Primary and Secondary Schools.

Zhuanghang Xinyi Qiaji Pawnshop was previously implicated in a lawsuit filed by the Shanghai Zhixiang Zhuang because the manager owed money, resulting in Cao's business being suspended for two years. Recently, various agencies such as the town's chamber of commerce and the district office have taken into consideration the famine and crop failure, and the poor people rely on relief. The unemployed workers of the pawnshop have also repeatedly asked the district party headquarters to find ways to restore the business. Therefore, the pawnshop has now recruited new capital to reorganize the business.</p>
<p>Distribution of the Renji Public Bureau's Property. The property of the Renji Public Bureau in the Seventh District has been used to provide funds for the Renji Elementary School in the district. Now, the Education Bureau, in order to unify the educational expenses, has reported the acceptance of all the property. However, the original donors of the district, the Zang family, and others, believe that there is still a part that is specifically used for charity, such as infant care and coffin distribution, which are in progress and cannot be stopped. Therefore, they simultaneously telegraphed the provincial government, and the county convened the relevant parties to discuss and decide that the Education Bureau should allocate half of the property it has received to the bureau for continued use. However, after the relief home is established in the future, it will still need to be transferred.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Exemption of Rice Mill Tax to be Used for Public Sales. The Shanghai Ninghu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association Federation held a joint meeting in Shanghai to discuss ways to provide relief to the people. Zhao Zixin, the executive member of the Wuyi Rice and Bean Industry Association, specially proposed a proposal to discuss the possibility of temporarily exempting the rice mill tax for three months, or using the income from the rice mill tax for three months for public sales, and submitting it to the provincial government and the civil and financial departments for approval and implementation, similar to the case resolved by the Beijing Special Municipality.</p>

Wang replied that he had to go to the Zhouxin Town agency before he could do so. However, Zhang refused and forcibly opened it. Afterwards, Wang Delin reported the incident to the First Class Post Office in this county, which forwarded it to Li Rongfu, the postal director of the Jiangsu District, who sent a letter to the county government requesting that District Chief Zhang, who had opened the mail package without authorization, be punished. After approving the letter, County Magistrate Sun issued a severe reprimand to District Chief Zhang yesterday to show a slight punishment.</p>

They were armed with guns and sticks, displaying a fierce manner. After breaking down the door, they immediately used iron rods to injure Chen's lower body. One bandit fired several shots in a row, and one bullet pierced through Chen's wife's neck. The remaining bandits carried out a large-scale robbery, overturning boxes and cabinets. It is estimated that a large number of jewelry and clothing were stolen. They then shouted and left. The injured couple were carried to the Renhui Hospital in the town the next morning for treatment.

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Students Kidnapped in Sheyang Town Escape Danger Sheyang Town, which belongs to Shi Ying County, was previously burned to the ground by bandits.

<p>The Pitiable Superstition of Women Outside the North Gate of this city, near Xianning Nunnery, there is a Miss Xu. Yesterday (the 20th) at 5:00 PM, she invited a wandering woman from Yancheng to her home to communicate with the dead. According to the woman, she would die after being married for a month or would cause the death of her husband. Otherwise, she should offer the gold jewelry she brought on the Buddhist cabinet and kowtow at the crossroads to avoid this disaster. Miss Xu followed her words. When she returned after kowtowing, the gold jewelry on the Buddhist cabinet had disappeared without a trace. The woman had also disappeared like a yellow crane, and she realized that she had been deceived, losing about 300 yuan. It is also heard that a Miss Wang on Xihou Street was also subjected to the same fraudulent technique on the same day, losing more than 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>The Truth of the Mutual Accusations of Two Bureau Chiefs Because Hu Peng, the patrol captain of Yaozhuang Bridge appointed by Gu Xiaokuan, the head of the Jiashan Public Security Bureau, was armed and driven away by Wu Yingming, the head of the Fengjing Branch Bureau, Gu Xiaokuan has been unable to resolve the matter through repeated negotiations. He is accusing Wu of the crime of showing no respect to his superior in the county court. Wu Jingming, head of the Fengjing Branch Bureau, believes that Yaozhuang Bridge is within the jurisdiction of the Feng District police station. The Chief Constable is recommended and dispatched by the Director-General; the Branch Bureau Chief should assign him to serve at any location. Furthermore, there is irrefutable evidence that Hu Peng, while serving as the patrol captain at Yaozhuang Bridge, was involved in scandalous incidents that were discovered by the Feng Bureau. Hu, fearing punishment, fled. Wu is also accusing Hu in the county court. The preliminary trial court has not yielded results either. Currently, the two bureau chiefs are each presenting the facts and mutually accusing each other to the Civil Affairs Department of the provincial government. The dispute between the public security forces will inevitably be handled by the province. The county court has collected the original case files and is awaiting orders to be sent to the province for review.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Warrant Offender Arrested for Falsely Conscripting Troops and Sent to Beijing The provincial authorities recently learned that Xu Yuanchun dared to set up an agency in Hangzhou to falsely conscript troops. After being confirmed by all parties, He Jun, together with the provincial security team and police officers from the provincial capital Public Security Bureau, went to surround and raid the agency. A total of 37 people, including Xu Meixin, were captured. At that time, the false director Xu Yuanchun was at large. The next day, Xu went to the Department of Civil Affairs to inquire about the situation and was subsequently apprehended and detained in the military prison. After separate investigations, He Jun telegraphed the central government to request instructions on how to handle the matter.

<p>A Car of Unknown Origin Arrived in Hangzhou from Ningbo Yesterday, the police station of the Third District of Gongbu in this city detained a sedan-style car near the Gong area that came from Nanjing to Hangzhou.

The police station suspected that the car was suspicious and took the driver, Zhao Xindao, and another person to the station for questioning. According to their confession, the car was operating on the Ning Hang Road to Hangzhou and had been staying in the car for two nights after arriving in Hangzhou.

<h3>Overseas Mongolian Chinese Merchants Appeal</h3>
<p>Brutal Treatment by Mongol and Russian Forces</p>
<p>Telegraph Request to Recover Territory</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying (abbreviated): "Recently, we received a letter from all overseas Mongolian merchants, lamenting that since the loss of Outer Mongolia, all our merchants in Mongolia have been brutally treated by Russian and Mongolian forces and have been unable to endure the suffering. Recently, the situation has intensified and become more dangerous. All property and livestock of merchants in Outer Mongolia have been sealed off and are not allowed to leave the country. Furthermore, they are being extorted in various ways to achieve their goal of eliminating them. Overseas Mongolian merchants are facing an unprecedented catastrophe, and the situation is extremely critical. They have nowhere to appeal. They will publish a book of blood and tears, begging fellow countrymen from all walks of life to understand the truth and provide relief to save them from their predicament. We are extremely grateful for your blessings." A letter was attached to the meeting. "In view of this, the loss of Outer Mongolia not only devastated commerce, but also caused pain in the incomplete national territory. Therefore, we are submitting the situation in the letter and requesting that you examine it. We earnestly request that you instruct the ministry to discuss and develop methods for recovering territory and protecting commerce. We pray for this."</p>
<h3>Zhang Jingjiang</h3>
<p>Telegraphs Zhang Qun to Refute Rumors</p>
<p>A local newspaper recently published a telegraph from Zhang Jingjiang, chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, calling for peace. Reporters from various newspapers were deeply surprised and went to the municipal government to seek an audience with Mayor Zhang to inquire about the situation. Mayor Zhang, believing that Chairman Zhang was a pioneer who advocated thorough revolution, immediately determined that this unfounded telegram was a fabrication. However, in order to demonstrate credibility, he telegraphed Chairman Zhang, hoping to receive a reply for disclosure to dispel the doubts. It is now learned that Mayor Zhang has received a reply from Chairman Zhang, who believes that the telegram was fabricated and is extremely angry. He requests that Mayor Zhang investigate and punish the perpetrators. The original telegram from Chairman Zhang to Mayor Zhang is transcribed as follows: "The forged telegram published in the newspaper is blatant and fabricated. It is truly abominable. Speaking of peace with Yan Feng's warlords, even if they knew the revolution, they would not have done this. Your brother has followed the Premier in the revolution for thirty years, and the principles have been thoroughly implemented. Everyone knows this. Why need to be so clear? Moreover, the rebels are about to be eliminated, and the true unification can be achieved. This kind of rumor is not worth a knowledgeable person's smile. Please investigate and punish them."</p>

<p>Continued Report from the Shipping Association</p>
<h3>Japanese Customs Prevents Chinese Ships from Going to Japan</h3>
<p>Please Investigate Seriously and Intervene</p>
<p>The local Shipping Association, regarding the case of the Dalian Japanese Maritime Bureau preventing Chinese ships from going to Japan, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The association has now received a report from the Dalian Jiaoji Shipping Company stating that it will report the situation to the Ministry of Communications again. The original text is as follows: "We hereby submit a detailed report on the Dalian Maritime Bureau's prohibition of Chinese ships from loading goods. We respectfully request your review and immediate intervention. It has come to our attention that the Dalian Japanese Maritime Bureau is prohibiting Chinese ships from loading goods from Dalian to Japan. Our association has already submitted a report to your ministry requesting immediate intervention. We now report the following from the Dalian Zhengji General Company: The China ship of the Yingkou Overseas Trade Shipping Company, which is originally a Chinese merchant ocean passenger and cargo ship, has always been handled by our company. On the 8th of this month, it arrived in Dalian from Yingkou, originally scheduled to load coal and special products to Yokohama and Shimizu. Unexpectedly, the Dalian Maritime Bureau suddenly prohibited it, saying that Dalian is the Japanese mainland and that it infringes on its coastal shipping rights. The shipowner immediately sent a letter to our company requesting that we negotiate with the bureau on his behalf and state the reasons as follows: (1) According to the Lushun Dalian Concession Treaty and the Sino-Japanese agreement on the establishment of Dalian Customs, China has the right to this place and stipulates that Chinese and Japanese merchant ships enjoy the same preferential treatment. The bureau now considers it the mainland, which has no basis for treaty revision and should not discriminate against Chinese merchant ships, hindering Sino-Japanese relations. (2) According to the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Japanese merchant ships have the right to navigate the Chinese coast. The Japanese plenipotentiary minister Hayashi Gonsuke's note states, 'If it does not harm the domestic interests or peace, our government will strive for fairness and goodwill,' which proves that even in the Japanese mainland, Chinese merchant ships are allowed to conduct legitimate business. (3) According to past practices and recent facts, loading goods should not be prohibited. For example, A: From 1924, various ships of the Zhengji Company have been dispatched every year to load goods from Dalian to various ports in Japan, with customs declarations and other documents as proof. In the past one or two years, due to the many coastal goods in China, they have not been dispatched, which is a voluntary matter and not subject to any restrictions. B: On November 16 last year, the British merchant ship BilyofDavix loaded six Ford Motor Company cars from Yokohama to Dalian. The port's customs cited a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believing that it did not infringe on coastal shipping rights and issued a permit. C: This time, the ship was empty from Dalian. Previously, it had telegraphed the agents in Yokohama and Shimizu to inquire whether it was permissible. The reply was that there were no obstacles. Based on the above treaties and examples, our company, in order to fulfill its responsibilities as an agency, repeatedly contacted the Maritime Bureau but was always rejected. The ship was forced to set sail without loading on the 10th. The shipowner and cargo owner suffered unexpected losses due to the bureau's abuse of power and discrimination against Chinese merchants. This matter concerns our country's sovereignty and international shipping rights. Therefore, we are reporting all the circumstances truthfully. We earnestly request your review and immediate serious intervention for the sake of justice."</p>

All arrangements regarding the Central Army's deployment have been properly made and are expected to be resolved within a month. This time, the central government originally intended to show care for the locality and leniency, aiming at self-renewal, and did not want to easily initiate war. However, Yan and Feng stubbornly refuse to come to their senses, and have repeatedly engaged in rebellious acts, so there is no alternative but to resort to suppression to uphold national law. All rear area work, I hope that colleagues will work extra hard, and pay special attention to Qi Xieyuan and other former Beiyang warlords who were re-employed by Yan. (2) The central government has already taken the lead in implementing the reduction of redundant personnel. Our government and various bureaus should also strictly comply and report on it, and should not be treated as mere formality. (B) Matters for Discussion: (1) A plot of public land measuring 1.41 acres at the triangle between Zhonghua Road and Fangxie Road is proposed to be allocated for the construction of a memorial tower for the martyr Chen Gong Yingshi. Resolved: the plot of public land measuring 1.41 acres at the triangle between Zhonghua Road and Fangxie Road is approved to be allocated for the construction of a memorial tower for the martyr Chen Gong Yingshi. (2) Continued discussion of the scholarship regulations. Resolved: Approved as amended. (3) Review of the Bean and Rice Trade Association's request for continued exemption of sculled boats from taxation. Resolved: Sculled boats are not within the scope of the original exemption.

<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Stewards' Union</h3>
<p>Narrates the Truth about the Xin Jiangtian Steamboat Dispute</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Stewards' Union issued a statement to all sectors of society regarding the dispute of the Xin Jiangtian steamboat, excerpted as follows: Since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Jiangtian steamboat resumed sailing on February 11 after repairs, the former business director Xu Yankang immediately appointed Xie Baosheng as the acting comprador. When Xie disembarked, disputes arose due to his order for workers to pay for meals and tips. Fortunately, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau strictly prohibited it, and Mr. Jin Tingsun took office to mediate, which was resolved. However, Xie's students Hu Changming, Ying Abao, Tan Afa, etc. (also stewards on the ship), more than 20 people, often had opinions with the workers. The workers could no longer tolerate it and rose up in opposition. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, when the ship was about to set sail for Ningbo and the workers were receiving passengers, suddenly thirty or forty French Concession detectives arrived on the ship, each holding a pistol, and handcuffed the members of the union one by one and sent them to the French Concession police station in the Sixteenth District for detention. More than sixty or seventy workers were subsequently detained. Workers who made the slightest defense were beaten with fists and sticks. More than twenty people were slightly injured, two were missing, and three were seriously injured. The union has sent them to the Nanyang Hospital for treatment. After this case occurred, the union immediately sent personnel to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to ask for responsible bail. After the company telegraphed the French Concession police station, all were released without charge. In order to uphold national law and protect human rights, the union has submitted a petition to the higher authorities for thorough investigation and sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to make corresponding demands. The details are announced above so that people from all walks of life can understand the truth and give the union sympathetic assistance.</p>

<h3>City Government Consults Various Departments on Protecting Russian Merchants Returning to China to Buy Tea</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special Mayor Zhang Qun, based on a report from the Social Bureau and forwarded by the Shanghai Tea Guild, requested protection for the Russian Merchants' Assistance Company to return to China to purchase Chinese tea. Yesterday, he specially consulted the Ministries of Military Affairs, Agriculture and Mining, Industry and Commerce, Foreign Affairs, and Finance to discuss protection measures. The consultation was about this matter. According to the report from the Municipal Social Bureau, Chen Zhaoshou et al. of the Shanghai Tea Guild reported that the Russian Merchants' Assistance Company suspended business and returned to Russia in August last year due to the Sino-Eastern Railway incident. Unfinished procedures were handed over to the British company Jardine Matheson to clear them. Chinese tea has since been at a standstill. Those unsold cannot be promoted, and payments for those sold have not been fully received. The market is sluggish, financial resources are depleted, capital has been exhausted, and the future is bleak. It has been found that the Shen and Han branches of the Assistance Company purchased approximately 14.5 million taels of Chinese tea annually, accounting for half of the total amount of Chinese tea. Now that the new tea season is approaching, everyone is eager for the company to resume business, but there is still no news. The guild could not bear it, so it sent a telegram to the head office in Moscow to inquire about news of its return to China and conveyed its sincere welcome. The reply was received, translated to mean: "Before the head office decides whether to return to China, we want to know what kind of guarantees can be obtained for business and personal safety." The English original is attached for your reference. Please quickly forward this to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. How can its business and personal safety be guaranteed? Please give clear instructions and immediately forward them to Moscow. Please also ask the government to telegraph the Soviet representative to earnestly declare protection for its business and the safety of its individuals, so that it can come to China with peace of mind and save the hundreds of thousands of tea farmers, industrialists, and merchants who are struggling. The new tea will soon be on the market, which is imminent. Please approve its implementation, etc. Accordingly, it has been found that Chinese tea in overseas markets has been taken over by British Indian and Ceylon tea, and American tea by Japanese tea. The largest customer is only Russia. Therefore, the suspension of the Russian company has a great impact. The Russian company's reply to the guild states that whether China can guarantee its business and personal safety is a prerequisite for deciding to come to China to purchase Chinese tea. Sino-Russian negotiations are underway. If Russian merchants sincerely come to China to do business, China should be responsible for protecting their merchants' lives and property in order to facilitate foreign trade. Now that the new tea season is approaching, it is feared that if measures are not taken to rescue the tea industry as soon as possible, the future of the tea industry will be unthinkable. The foregoing facts have been reported. In addition to instructions, the original Russian reply has been attached to the report for your review and approval. It should be quickly forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval and to the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture and Mining, and Military Affairs for review and discussion of rescue methods to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain the tea industry, etc. Accordingly, this matter concerns foreign trade and has a great impact on domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce. A letter should be sent to find ways to rescue it. In addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan for handling and forwarding it separately, a copy of the attached telegram is enclosed for your ministry to plan rescue measures and to provide a reply. To maintain our public friendship, this consultation is hereby made.</p>
<h3>Appeal to Repair the Tang Pagoda in Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Five Notes on the Case</p>
<p>The Bao Xing Twin Pagodas of the Tang Dynasty in Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, are being coveted for their foundations, with the intention of demolition and sale. Local gentry and fellow villagers from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have sent telegrams to various government offices, appealing for repairs. This case has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The latest news is as follows: (1) The fellow villagers and Beijing officials from the county sent a telegram to the county magistrate but found no news, which was very surprising. They sent another telegram to Chairman Zhang Jingjiang to ask for a donation for repairs, and also sent a letter to Feng Hengyun, stating, "Yongru, my classmate, the twin pagodas of the North Temple are causing a lot of talk in the city. Fang Ling also knows that he is surrounded. We telegraphed him to prohibit demolition, and you are appealing for repairs, both with the intention of loving our hometown and unwilling to see the ancient relics of the area destroyed. Those who are blinded by profit are still trying to achieve their goal of demolition and sale, so we sent another telegram to Chairman Zhang the other day, asking him to order a stop to it." (2) Dai Jitao, President of the Central Examination Yuan, agreed to repair and donated 100 yuan. President Dai had been to Pinghu, so he was familiar with the local history and customs, hence this move. Wang Yiting, a Shanghai gentleman from Lake, also happily donated 100 yuan, and there are others who have continued to donate. The elders in the hometown have recognized enough for 1,000 yuan, and after the Civil Affairs Office approves, work will begin. (3) The Shanghai Pinghu Fellow Villagers' Association recently heard that the main demolitionists were instigating local tabloids to ask the county to demolish the pagodas. The Cunping People's Daily even publicly scolded the main repairers as inhuman and wrote a special commentary stating that the demolition of the pagodas could not be changed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Provincial Government, or the Civil Affairs Department, and could not be robbed by Wang Yiting et al. An urgent telegram was sent to the Civil Affairs Department stating that the public opinion in Pinghu supports the repair of the Tang Pagoda and the sentiment is unanimous. The association has twice telegraphed County Magistrate Fang, requesting that he submit it to your office and approve the repair. The undersigned is shocked to hear that someone in the area is demolishing the pagoda without waiting for a provincial order. Therefore, this telegram is sent to request that the county be ordered to stop it and that the case be investigated and repaired to protect the historical sites and respect public opinion. The Shanghai Pinghu Fellow Villagers' Association respectfully bows. (4) The Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department replied to the Shanghai Pinghu Fellow Villagers' Association in a telegram stating, "The telegram has been received. This case has been repeatedly ordered to Pinghu County Magistrate to stop the demolition and to urge him to investigate and re-examine the case. According to the previous telegram, the county magistrate has been ordered by telegram not to demolish it without permission before receiving the order. Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department seals." (5) The Pinghu fellow villagers in Hangzhou sent a special letter to Shanghai to discuss whether to correct the repeated slanders in the hometown newspapers. It is expected to be discussed at the next standing committee meeting.</p>
<h3>All Anhui Associations Strive for Anhui Mines</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining</p>
<p>The All Anhui Associations telegraphed the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining the day before yesterday, stating, "To Minister Yi of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining in Nanjing, Ni Nizi has harmed Anhui for many years, and there is widespread resentment. The revolutionary comrades, in particular, are irreconcilable. His monopolization and encroachment on the Lieshan Coal Mine and Yihua Iron Mine were proposed by the people of Anhui to be confiscated and placed under the management of your ministry during the Northern Expedition. For two years, it was expected that the results would be excellent and benefit the country and the people, which was very gratifying. Recently, it has been heard that your ministry has reached an agreement with the shareholders of the two mines, Tang Jiaji, Zhao Wenqi, and others, to establish a board of directors, which is a disguised way of returning the mines. The news is shocking. The Central Political Council does have regulations for returning shares to merchants, but in fact, it is only a small number. The revolutionary comrades of Anhui Province should participate in the review so that they can be distinguished. If Tang Jiaji, Zhao Wenqi, and others were counter-revolutionaries who helped evil and whose bad deeds are obvious, their individual shares should be within the scope of confiscation and there is no possibility of representing merchant shares and engaging in compromise. If this is unfortunately the case, the people of Anhui will be indignant and a large-scale storm will inevitably be brewed. The minister is a revolutionary pioneer and would not take such measures that violate public opinion. However, people are talking and the facts are clear. A special telegram is sent to your ministry to show the truth to dispel the doubts of the public. Do not disappoint our expectations. Respectfully, the All Anhui Associations in Shanghai bow."</p>
<h3>News of the Reorganization of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>Since Zhao Shouheng was transferred to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications as director, he has made every effort to reorganize the bureau's affairs.

After the funds are raised, a request will be made to the municipal government for appropriate subsidies. (B) Fire brigades can be organized by each industry, which is easier to implement and yields better results. Resolved: Cloth industry, Dried Goods industry, Floral Clothing industry, Imported Goods and Rice industry, and Fresh and Salted Meat industry groups will be organized to be responsible for the implementation.

<h3>Shuyuan Garden</h3>
<p>Assassination of a Young Man</p>
<p>Bullet Pierces Directly Through the Back of the Head</p>
<p>Two Assailants Involved</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 22nd), around 5 PM, within a certain surname's Shuyuan Garden, located in the Wang Teng Ci area southwest of the Da Jin Jia Xiang in the western suburbs of Shanghai, on Huo Bi Lan Road (about five li from Zhoujiaqiao), a case of a young man being assassinated and killed suddenly occurred. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Gunshot in the Woods: According to the villagers in the Wang Teng Ci area near the location, around 4:30 PM, two individuals wearing silk short jackets and one individual wearing a long jacket, totaling three people, all young, walked west from Huo Bi Lan Road. They were walking and talking, appearing relaxed and cheerful, and entered the Shuyuan Garden, as if strolling and taking a walk. The villagers did not pay much attention at the time. The three went deep into the woods. About thirty minutes later, the villagers suddenly heard a loud gunshot. Although they were very shocked, they did not dare to look directly. Moments later, two individuals, one in a long jacket and one in a short jacket, came out along the original route and hurriedly headed east. Seeing the two had gone far, the villagers rushed to the Shuyuan Garden and found a man shot and lying on the ground, his head covered in blood. He was already dead, indicating he had been shot by the two who had left.</p>
<p>Bullet in the Back of the Head: After the villagers spread the word, the Tu Di Bao Guan Xin Fu from the third Tu of the area reported the incident to the Third Sub-Precinct of the Sixth District in Zhoujiaqiao. Upon receiving the report, Inspector Wei of the precinct immediately led police officers to the garden to conduct a thorough investigation. They found that the unidentified male corpse was approximately 24 or 25 years old, of medium build, with a yellowish complexion and no pockmarks, and a flat haircut. He was wearing a blue crepe gauze lined jacket, blue crepe gauze lined pants, white silk socks, rubber galoshes, and a brownish-yellow felt bowler hat, which was quite new. He had a silk wide belt around his waist and resembled a tea server or similar. The bullet had entered from the back of his head, penetrating his brain, and exiting through the left corner of his mouth, fired only once.</p>
<p>Items Beside the Body: After conducting a thorough investigation, Inspector Wei found no money on the body. Only a business card was found in the jacket pocket, bearing the name "Yin A Wu" and the words "Former Fourth Class Cabin No. 45 of the Jiang Tian Steamer." Whether this was the deceased's card could not be confirmed. There was also a pawn ticket indicating a pawn of five jiao of foreign currency on May 21 at a certain pawnshop in Ningbo. Based on this pawn ticket, it was inferred that the deceased was still in Ningbo on May 21, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of May 22, and was shot in the afternoon. Some speculated that the deceased may have worked on the steamer. Inspector Wei then reported the details to District Chief Ren of the Sixth District Police Station for assessment. Upon receiving the report, District Chief Ren not only immediately reported to the General Bureau but also ordered all subordinates to pursue and arrest the perpetrators for investigation.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Examination: Around 9 AM yesterday morning, Tu Di Bao Guan Xin Fu of the third Tu reported to the District Court, requesting the dispatch of personnel for examination. Around 3:20 PM in the afternoon, assigned Prosecutor Li Gongchen and Clerk Deng, along with the examiner, arrived at the scene to conduct an examination. They confirmed that the deceased had indeed been shot from behind, with the bullet penetrating from the back of the head straight through to the left corner of the mouth, resulting in a fatal wound. They completed the coroner's report. Since no family members could be found to claim the body, the Tu Di Bao Guan Xin Fu was instructed to arrange for temporary coffin burial, with an assurance. However, the cause of death could not be determined immediately.</p>
<p>In the East Asia Hotel</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Loses a Fortune in Theft</h3>
<p>Husband and Wife Retire to Bed, Exhausted After Dinner</p>
<p>Wake Up to Find Clothing and Valuables Gone</p>
<p>Tang Tenghan, an overseas Chinese from Nan Yang, originally from Longxi, Fujian, and currently 30 years old, studied in Germany for several years and returned last month. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 21st of this month with his wife, Ms. Xu Jingmei, and stayed in Room 403 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. They brought multiple trunks and items. The night before last, at 8:30 PM, he and his wife went out for dinner and returned at 9:15 PM. Feeling tired, they both went to bed. When Tang and his wife got up at 6 AM yesterday morning to change clothes, they found the clothes hanging in the closet gone. Suspecting something was wrong, they checked their trunks and found a small iron box missing. It contained valuable jewelry such as gemstones, gold rings, and gold bracelets, all gone, estimated to be worth over a thousand yuan. Tang panicked and immediately reported to the Old Gate Police Station, requesting an investigation to recover their lost valuables.</p>
<p>Singer Sewing Machine Company Student</p>
<h3>Escapes with a Fortune</h3>
<p>Yang Bingkun Ordered to Deliver Funds</p>
<p>Kong Huifang Volunteers for the Task</p>
<p>Disappears with the Money</p>
<p>At the Singer Sewing Machine Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhili Road, around 4 PM yesterday afternoon, the accounting department, after completing the accounts, was to deliver the earnings to the Singer Company's general office upstairs in the HSBC Bank on the Bund. Yesterday's earnings totaled 451 US dollars, equivalent to over 1,000 Chinese silver dollars. They ordered student Yang Bingkun to deliver the funds. Yang, upon hearing the order, took the money and left. Reaching near Henan Road, another student from the company, Kong Huifang, approached on a rented bicycle, calling out to Yang, claiming to have business at the general office and requesting Yang to hand over the US dollars. Since Yang had to go elsewhere to collect funds, he handed over all the US dollars without suspicion. Kong then sped away. At 6 PM, when Yang returned from collecting the funds, the accounting department asked why he was late in delivering the money. At the same time, the company's general office on the Bund called to inquire. Yang Bingkun then told the truth. The company, upon realizing that Kong Huifang had not arrived by evening, concluded that Kong had escaped with the money and immediately reported to the Old Gate Police Station, requesting an investigation. It is reported that student Kong Huifang is 21 years old, from Ningbo, and usually reliable. This incident is highly suspicious.</p>
<p>Tong Zhaoqing Teases a Woman</p>
<h3>Beaten to Death by a Group of People</h3>
<p>Assailants Flee in a Panic</p>
<p>Tong Dies Before Receiving Treatment</p>
<p>Tong Zhaoqing, a resident of Shuangxing Li No. 19, Xie Xu Road in the Chinese Concession, from Zhenjiang, and 28 years old, worked in a brothel at No. 77, Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. At 1 AM yesterday morning, he was teasing a woman in front of the establishment when a passerby, named Jia, and others, feeling it was unjust, grabbed Tong and beat him severely, using fists and feet. Tong was injured and fell to the ground. The assailants fled in a panic. His colleagues then took Tong by rickshaw to the nearby Xie Qiao Hospital for treatment, but the hospital refused to admit him. They then took him to the Si Ming Hospital, which also refused admission due to the late hour. As they tried to return to the workplace, Tong, whose vital parts had been severely injured in the beating, died en route. The incident was reported to the French Police Station, which had the body transported to the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang Mortuary for an autopsy. The police also notified the deceased's cousin, Tong Zhaosheng (who works at the Sanxin Ribbon Shop at No. 10, Jiangyin Dai), to come to the station. Subsequently, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Concession Court, who arrived at the mortuary at 2 PM to examine the body. He confirmed that the deceased had indeed been beaten to death and ordered the family to collect the body for burial while the police investigated and apprehended the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Public Concession</p>
<h3>Tram Workers' Welcome Reception Postponed</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Tram Club originally scheduled a welcome rally for yesterday (the 23rd) at the open space on Dalianwan Road. However, due to inclement weather, they planned to change the venue to the Assembly Hall. After unsuccessful negotiations, it was decided to postpone the event to a later date. Due to the short notice, the change was not widely publicized. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, a group of people still arrived, and representatives from various organizations also arrived in succession, bringing congratulatory messages and banners to present. The club's organizers, who were waiting there, greeted them, explained the reason for the postponement, and expressed their sincere thanks. All banners prepared by the various organizations were delivered to the club's temporary office.</p>
<p>Water Users</p>
<h3>Negotiation on Private Tampering of Water Meter Needles</h3>
<p>Municipal Public Works Bureau Orders the Company to Handle According to Regulations</p>
<p>The Inland Water Company recently sent personnel to record water meters of its users and discovered that the Guangchangfa Dyeing Factory on Anlan Road had tampered with the water meter needles. The factory installed the meter in December of the 18th year. The accumulated gallon count on the meter reached 301,700 gallons by April 21. However, by the time of the meter reading on May 20, the count was only 36,700 gallons, a decrease of 265,000 gallons compared to April. Upon inspection, the three needles representing thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands could all move, indicating that they had been forcibly turned. According to Article 28 of the Company's revised regulations, any user who tampers with the meter needles to reduce water fees, regardless of the number of buildings, shall not only be charged the water fee for the previous month but also compensate for the loss of 200 yuan. If the water meter is damaged, the user must also compensate for the cost of the repair. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Works Bureau sent personnel to inspect and found that the internal mechanisms of the meter were not damaged, but the needles had indeed been moved. The bureau immediately ordered the company to negotiate directly with the Guangchangfa company according to the business regulations. If they refuse to comply, legal action should be taken for resolution in court.</p>
<h3>Bloody Incident in Flour Mill</h3>
<p>Old Storekeeper's Life in Danger</p>
<p>Perpetrator Apprehended on the Spot</p>
<p>Xu Akun, a 28-year-old man from Wuxi, has been working as an old storekeeper in the warehouse of the Jiufeng Flour Mill at No. 32 Guangfu Road in Zhabei. Gao Keming, a 25-year-old man also from Wuxi, serves as an accounts clerk in the same warehouse. Gao recently sold dozens of bags of flour from the warehouse privately, pocketing more than 2,000 yuan. Upon learning of this, Xu wrote a letter to the mill owner Cai Jisan in Wuxi. A week later, Cai arrived in Shanghai, checked the accounts, and found evidence of multiple acts of fraud. When questioned by Cai, Gao stared blankly and had no answer. Cai ordered him to return the funds in full, and before returning to his hometown, instructed the chief accountant to set a deadline for Gao to pay the money. Several days later, Gao, feeling cornered, began investigating and learned that Xu had informed the owner through a letter. Harboring resentment, Gao seized a flour knife, about one foot four inches long and two inches wide, and barged into Xu's bedroom at around 6 PM yesterday evening. Without any explanation, he slashed Xu four times, once on the back of the head. When Xu was injured, he immediately used both hands to cover the painful area, but Gao slashed him again, cutting off two fingers, once on the right arm, and once on the back of the left hand. Seeing the enormity of his actions, the perpetrator turned to flee but was surrounded by the mill workers and apprehended along with the weapon. The injured Xu was taken to the Baolong Hospital for treatment by his brother Apei. It is reported that his injuries are quite critical.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Actively Prepares to Build Jiangwan Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>Land Price of 38,000 Yuan Already Received</p>
<p>Land Bureau to Begin Requisition of Private Land</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Qun, considering that travelers and sojourners in Shanghai come from all over, rich or poor, tend to float coffins in any place when they die, resulting in many coffins scattered around the suburbs. It is unpleasant to the eye and harmful to hygiene, especially in summer. Therefore, he specially instructed Health Bureau Director Hu Hongji and Land Bureau Director Zhu Yan to actively requisition private land to build a public cemetery, starting with Jiangwan. Upon receiving the order, the two directors immediately dispatched personnel to Jiangwan to investigate the names and land ownership of the private land owners, as well as to survey the land. They have now completed the investigation and survey. The required land price of 38,000 yuan has also been requested from the Finance Bureau for immediate allocation, so that they can comply with the provisions of the Land Requisition Law, issue public notices in accordance with the law, and notify the landowners to start requisitioning the land for construction. Yesterday, the Health and Land Bureaus received an order from the Municipal Government that with the summer heat approaching, hygiene is important, and that the construction of the Jiangwan Public Cemetery should be actively promoted. The two directors have already assigned additional staff to assist in handling this matter in order to see it completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Xu Chongji Attends a Play and Returns Home</p>
<h3>Thugs Sever His Feet</h3>
<p>Claims to Have No Enemies</p>
<p>Perpetrators Possibly Mistook Him for Someone Else</p>
<p>Xu Chongji, a 27-year-old man from Zhenjiang who is in the foreign goods business, left the Tianchan Stage on Er Ma Road at around 2 AM yesterday morning to eat a late-night snack. After finishing his meal, he returned to his residence on foot. Walking to the intersection of Da Xin Street on Si Ma Road, four men in long robes suddenly jumped out from behind, brandishing axes and severing both of Xu's feet, causing him to fall to the ground in a pool of blood. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the perpetrators fled. Subsequently, Street Patrol No. 194 of the Old Gate Police Station found the injured man and took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, Xu's leg bones had been broken, and although his life was not in danger, he may be permanently disabled. Afterwards, Xu told people that he had no enemies in his life and that this tragedy was likely due to the perpetrators mistaking him for someone else, which could be described as an undeserved disaster.</p>
<h3>After Fatally Hitting a Young Man</h3>
<p>Truck Speeds Away</p>
<p>Around 9 PM last night, a young man, approximately 16 or 17 years old, wearing blue cloth clothes, black shoes, and no socks, walking bareheaded, was walking along Dalianwan Road in Hongkou when he was suddenly hit by a truck, resulting in a fatal injury. The police officer No. 1997 arrived after hearing the news. However, the truck, seeing that it had caused the accident, sped away, escaping without a trace. The body was sent to the Tongren Hospital for an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wenqing Accused of</h3>
<p>Conspiring to Murder Stepmother Case Continues</p>
<p>Monk Yushan Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Waiting for Witnesses Bao and Chen</p>
<p>Zhang Wenqing, a 24-year-old unmarried woman from Huzhou, due to a dispute over inheritance, allegedly colluded with Chen Hengcai, Yao Yonggui, Gao Jintang, etc., on the evening of January 25th of this year, at her home located at No. 762 Carter Road, and used a knife to kill her stepmother Zhang Su. This case has been opened and heard nine times in the former Provisional Court and the Special District Court. The details of the trial have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the tenth hearing, with more than a hundred men and women in the audience. At 2:30 PM, Judge Wu Tingqi, accompanied by Prosecutor Xu Mei, arrived at the Second Court. Fang Ming and Wei Wenhan, lawyers representing the victim's family, as well as Wang Fuchang and Jiang Baoli, lawyers for the defendant Zhang Wenqing, and Fan Gang, the lawyer appointed to provide pro bono defense for defendant Chen Hengcai, Wang Shaochang, the lawyer for Yao Yonggui, and Chao Kun, the lawyer for Gao Jintang, all eight people were present to await instructions. The witness, monk Yushan, aged 58, from Jiangbei, residing as the abbot of the Chong Ning Temple in Zhenjiang, first complained. Judge Wu immediately asked the monk if he had any relationship with the Zhang family and what the situation was. The monk said, "When I was lecturing at the Tongshan Hall Temple on Carter Road in Shanghai, Wenqing's father, Fusheng, and both of his mothers, including Zhang Su, came to listen to the lectures, and thus I became acquainted with them. Later, they all worshiped me as their teacher. Around September of last year, I learned in Tongshan Hall that the Zhang family was embroiled in property disputes and wanted to file a lawsuit. I advised them to reconcile because litigation would lead to misfortune. I asked the deceased Zhang Su to provide 1,500 yuan to Zhang Wenqing and 1,000 yuan to the eldest wife as future funeral expenses, and to provide 5 yuan per month to the eldest wife for pocket money. Both parties expressed their agreement." Judge Wu then issued the written evidence to the monk to read and asked if it was indeed the evidence. The monk replied, "Yes." Subsequently, Judge Wu repeatedly questioned the deceased's younger brother Su Yaoting and the deceased's two sons for two hours. The testimonies of each person had already been provided in previous trials, so they will not be repeated here. However, Chen Hengcai testified that before the event, a person named Bao often came to the Zhang family to play mahjong and had an affair with Wenqing, and that Gao Jintang had induced him to avenge his mother, mortgaging the house in Zhenjiang to Gao for 350 yuan, with a written agreement stored at Chen Yongwen's place. Therefore, Wenqing's lawyer requested that Bao and Chen be summoned to clarify the truth. The police lawyer also stated that when Chen Hengcai was arrested, he confessed to the existence of Bao, and the police had summoned Bao to the police station for questioning, finding that Bao did not have a significant relationship with the case, so he was not added as a witness. Finally, Judge Wu ordered the start of the debate. After the police lawyer Ru and the lawyers for both the plaintiff and the defendant stood up and debated, it was already six o'clock. Judge Wu ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately, and the hearing would be postponed until the witnesses arrive for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Xin Xiangtai Steamer</h3>
<p>Fireman Conflicts With Customs Officers</p>
<p>Xin Xiangtai Steamer of Xiangtai Timber Firm, arrived yesterday. A fireman on the ship clashed with customs officers. One fireman was injured in the head. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Smuggled Opium Uncovered: Xin Xiangtai Steamer of Xiangtai Timber Firm, was transporting lumber. Around 3 PM yesterday afternoon, it docked at Zhangjiabang Wharf in Pudong to unload cargo. Customs officers of the Chinese and Western inspection teams boarded the ship by small boat to search for contraband. In groups, they thoroughly searched all cabins. Customs officers found a large amount of opium hidden in a pile of lumber in the ship's first cabin. The estimated weight was over one hundred and ten catties. The opium was confiscated and prepared to be taken to customs.</p>
<p>Conflict Erupts: Simultaneously, several customs officers were searching the ship's engine room when a copper-framed glass window fell from above and shattered. Wang Hongyuan (33 years old, from Ningbo), the ship's fireman, claimed that the customs officers broke it and demanded compensation. The customs officers disagreed, and a conflict ensued. A large group of people gathered, causing a major uproar. Wang Hongyuan's forehead on the left side of his head was injured, and blood covered his face. The situation was quite serious.</p>
<p>Aftermath: Seeing the situation was unfavorable and the opium had not yet been transported to customs, fearing that dockside bandits would take the opportunity to rob it, the customs officers immediately notified the Water Police Station. Detective Ge Changsheng and Chinese and Western police officers, fully armed, rushed to suppress the situation. First, they escorted the seized opium to customs, then took the injured fireman Wang Hongyuan and three other firemen at the scene to the police station. After briefly questioning them, they instructed Wang to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that the customs officers plan to accuse the four firemen of assault in court.</p>
<p>Failed Bombing of a Wealthy Man</p>
<h3>Blows Up His Own Right Hand</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Eighteen Months in Prison</p>
<p>Chen Ouyang, from Guangdong, threw a bomb at the intersection of the Zilai Street on Dama Road in the French Concession on the evening of the 16th of last month, accidentally injuring his own right hand. The No. 33 Vietnamese police officer caught Chen and took him to the police station, and then to Guangci Hospital for treatment. After a Western doctor amputated his right hand, he recovered and was discharged from the hospital the other day. Yesterday, the police sent him to the French Court for questioning. Western Detective Satayel stated that it was found that the defendant and his gang threw bombs on Zilai Street that day, hoping to harm a certain wealthy businessman, but unfortunately, he injured his own hand. He requested an investigation. The No. 31 Vietnamese police officer reported that he was on duty at the scene that day when he suddenly heard a huge explosion. The defendant, about fifty French feet away, was running away injured. He immediately chased and arrested him. When questioned, Chen Ouyang confessed that the bomb was asked by a friend Ou Ahui to temporarily hold on behalf of civilians, but unexpectedly it suddenly exploded after about ten minutes. The civilians really did not know it was a bomb and were harmed by friends. Asked why he harmed you, (answer) because the civilians owed him several yuan and had not yet returned it.

<h3>Zhao Aidi's Reason for Breaking Off Engagement</h3>
<p>Fiancé is Deaf and Has a Mental Illness</p>
<p>The Matchmaker's Introduction Was All Lies</p>
<p>Zhao Aidi, a 19-year-old woman from Ningbo, was betrothed by her brother, Zhao Laishun, to Lin Baoqing, a fellow villager residing at No. 1076 Huadefang, Donghuade Road, against her will. Lin sued her in the Special District Court, requesting the court to order Aidi to fulfill the marriage contract, which had been reported in the newspapers after a hearing. Now it is known that Aidi's reason for not wanting to marry Lin Baoqing is that Lin has a mental illness and is deaf in both ears, so she is determined not to marry him. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu opened the court for a continued hearing. The plaintiff claimed to be ill and did not attend. The defendant, Zhao Ai, also hired a lawyer to file a counterclaim, requesting the dissolution of the marriage contract, and stated that Lin's absence was not due to illness, but fearing that his mental illness and deafness would be discovered in court. Judge Xu then asked Aidi, who testified that her brother had arranged the marriage for her without her consent. After the betrothal gifts were given, she found out and argued with her brother. Her brother then investigated and realized that the matchmaker's words were all lies, so she planned to cancel the contract. Unexpectedly, on February 16, the other party forcibly sent a large platter of gifts. However, marriage is a lifelong matter, and since she had not agreed to it beforehand, she requested to be allowed to dissolve the marriage contract. Lin Baoqing's lawyer then submitted a list of clothing and jewelry to the court, stating that Aidi broke off the engagement because she did not get the desired 2,000 yuan in dowry listed on the list. However, Lin Aidi and her brother completely denied the presented bill of accounts. After the lawyers for both parties debated, Judge Xu adjourned the hearing until the morning of the 28th of this month for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Son-in-Law Seeks Wife, Encounters Mother-in-Law</h3>
<p>Sun Xiaosizi Comes to Shanghai to Report to the Police</p>
<p>Sun Huang, a woman from Huai'an, has no sons, only one daughter, named Ar Er, now 21 years old. Three years ago, she arranged for a local man, Sun Xiaosizi, to marry her daughter, with a dowry of 40 foreign yuan and four acres of fertile land. Sun Xiaosizi was to be responsible for all of Sun Huang's living, dying, and burial expenses. A marriage certificate was drawn up. Less than a month after the marriage, Ar Er did not follow the way of a wife. When Sun Xiaosizi interfered, Sun Huang and her daughter assaulted him. Sun Xiaosizi was no match for them, so he hired someone to write a petition and sue the Zhenjiang County Government. Later, due to domestic disputes, he was ordered to settle out of court. Sun Huang then fled to Shanghai with her daughter and hid in Jiqingfang, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. Sun Xiaosizi found out and followed them to Shanghai, waiting near Jiqingfang every day. He saw his mother-in-law carrying a teapot to a stove to get water. Sun Xiaosizi bumped into them, followed them home, and saw his wife Ar Er inside. Sun Xiaosizi then went outside to report to the police, bringing Sun Huang and her daughter to the first police station in the Fourth District. Station Chief Yao questioned Ar Er, who said, "After I married Xiaosizi, the relationship was good, but then Xiaosizi suddenly changed, not doing his job properly. I repeatedly advised him to stop, so I didn't want to stay with him and came to Shanghai with my mother to work." Since the case concerned a marital dispute, he was ordered to prepare a document and transfer it to the District Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wife's Extravagant Spending</h3>
<p>Husband Commits Suicide in Shanghai</p>
<p>Zhang Tingfa, a 25-year-old man from Changzhou, lived in Wantai Xinghao outside the Dongmen Tianning Temple in his hometown. He worked at the Zhentai Rice Shop behind the Huiming Bridge in the city, earning little. Fortunately, he had several acres of fertile land that could barely provide him with a warm meal. He married a woman two years ago, and their relationship was quite affectionate. However, she had a habit of extravagant spending in her mother's home, and even if she was given ten gold coins a day, she could spend them all in one day. However, Zhang was just a merchant, earning only a small amount each month, and could not satisfy her desires. Whenever she was short of money, she would quarrel with Zhang. As a result, Tingfa resented this and tried to commit suicide twice in his hometown, but he was rescued. The other day (the 21st), Zhang had another dispute, so he came to Shanghai alone and checked into the Lao Dingxing Inn on Shilu Road. He secretly took opium to end his life. Yesterday morning at 7:30 AM, the tea servant heard a groan in the room and pushed open the door to enter, seeing Zhang's face was pale and he was unconscious. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but due to the overdose of poison, he died at 5:30 PM that day. A suicide note to his aunt was found in his pocket, which said, "I believe you already know about my difficult situation, but I do not want to die in my hometown, I wish to be a ghost in a foreign land, enjoying great kindness in this life, and I will repay you someday."</p>

<h3>Legal Dispute in Medical Circles</h3>
<p>Lu Yuanlei, Dean of Academic Affairs at the National Medical College on Avenue Joffre, filed a lawsuit with the Special District Court. This was due to attacks by the "Health News," which accused his theories of being absurd and disorganized, falsely claiming he authored treatises, and stating he was a troublemaker who repeatedly instigated disturbances. Yesterday, Judge Feng held the fifth hearing to investigate. Lu Yuanlei first stated that after the defendant's public attacks, he lost the trust of patients and students' families, leaving him no choice but to sue. The defendant hired attorney Xi Ya-fu to defend, arguing that Lu's theories were fragmented and inconsistent. They claimed that both the National Pharmaceutical Association Journal and the Guangdong Xinglin Medical Journal had published lengthy refutations, which was undeniable. Furthermore, instigating disturbances and deliberately causing trouble were well-documented. He initially caused a disturbance at the Chinese Medicine Professional School, then joined the Chinese Medical College and stirred up more trouble, driving out staff and attempting unsuccessfully to maintain control. They stated that the principal and a staff member of the two schools could provide official letters as proof. The plaintiff then stated that regarding the absurdity of his theories, because opinions differed, he would not deny it. However, he did not participate in the disturbances at the Chinese Medical College, only serving as a committee member in the student-organized school affairs maintenance association at the time. Two witnesses then testified to the actual circumstances of the disturbance. Attorney Xi then argued, generally stating that newspapers could publish factual events at any time, which was not a crime according to the law, and requested that the case be dismissed. Judge Feng then announced that a verdict would be delivered on a scheduled date, and the plaintiff and defendant withdrew.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 8:30 PM, a fire broke out in the kitchen of the Hongchang pawnshop at No. 441, the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, for unknown reasons. Seeing the dense smoke, the shop's employees, realizing it was an accident, rushed outside. Soon, flames erupted through the roof, and the fire was raging. Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade dispatched fire trucks to extinguish the blaze. Because the pawnshop mainly stored clothes, the fire burned within, making it difficult to extinguish. As a result, all the storage rooms upstairs were burned. Firefighters worked hard to spray water and managed to protect the neighboring shops. The fire lasted for about forty-five minutes. It is said that the total losses are estimated to be over ten thousand gold.</p>

<p>Chen Mengyou, a Ningbo shoemaker residing at No. 74 Ronghua Lane, the intersection of Rue Bayle and Avenue Brière de l'Isle, lost his three-year-old son, Jifa, to scalding. Chen had taken his son to a public stove to brew tea. Shen Heshang, the owner of the Shen Wanxing cake shop at No. 571 next to the public stove, was also there with a porcelain teapot with a handle to brew tea. Unexpectedly, the bottom of the teapot fell off, and boiling water spilled, scalding the child's head and face, resulting in death after treatment at the hospital. This was previously reported. Yesterday, the police escorted Shen to the French Concession Court for questioning. The plaintiff recounted the previous events and stated that friends had mediated the matter, with the defendant compensating him eighty-five yuan for the cost of the coffin. However, the plaintiff's son had died, and the defendant was also a poor man, leaving no other recourse. He requested leniency. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Shen to a fine of twenty yuan and a one-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3>Ellis Pharmacy Sealed</h3>
<p>The Ellis Western Pharmacy on Hankou Road, which specializes in selling aphrodisiacs, endangering public health and corrupting morals, was ordered by the Special District Court to have the police search the pharmacy. A large quantity of aphrodisiacs was confiscated, and the owner, Chen Pengnian, was summoned to court, fined nine hundred yuan, and released after paying the fine. This has been reported three times in this newspaper. It is now known that President Yang of the Special District Court, believing that this type of illegal business should be eradicated to prevent its resurgence, issued a sealing order. Yesterday, he ordered bailiffs to go to Hankou Road and temporarily seal the Ellis Pharmacy, which specializes in selling aphrodisiacs, as a warning to others. As a result, businesses similar to Ellis Pharmacy are feeling a sense of shared misfortune. Many are taking precautions, putting away all kinds of aphrodisiacs.</p>
<h3>Obituary Compilation</h3>
<p>Yuan Fugui Crushes Gao You Native Zhou Jinsheng to Death</p>
<p>Zhou Jinsheng, 52 years old, a native of Gao You, was a contractor for various transportation goods in the business sector. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Zhou specially hired a boat owned by Jiang Zhang, a woman from Fenghua, to transport timber from the Xidoumaru steamship at the South Wharf of Puxia to a certain location. Jiang agreed to hire and docked the boat there. Yang Wu-erzi, a native of Yangzhou in charge of the crane on the ship, unloaded the timber onto Jiang's boat in the usual manner. However, while loading, Yang lifted a piece of timber from the ship without notifying Dai Youcai and Duan Ming, two natives of Gaoyou who were responsible for signaling the crane. He then arbitrarily lowered it onto the civilian boat. At that time, Yuan Fugui (29 years old), a boat partner from Fenghua, was on the boat tending to things. Unexpectedly, the timber fell, and he was unable to avoid it, being crushed on the head. Instantly, his brains splattered, and he collapsed on the boat, barely breathing. He died soon after due to his injuries. Jiang Zhang notified the deceased's sister, Ge Yuan, and together they reported the incident to the Municipal Police Bureau Water Patrol Team. They claimed that Yang Wu-erzi's negligence had caused the death and requested a thorough investigation. Chief Xu dispatched police to summon the defendant, Yang Wu-erzi, and witnesses Dai Youren and Zhou Jinsheng, for preliminary interrogation. As the matter involved a death, he ordered the preparation of documents to report to the Municipal Police Bureau for further investigation. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Shanghai District Court requesting the assignment of personnel for an inspection. Around 5:00 PM, Prosecutor Li and others arrived at the scene.

<h3>Flower Gambling Den Raided on Lloyd Road</h3>
<p>Run by Yin Baosheng and Wife</p>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Council police have viewed flower gambling as a social evil, just like roulette gambling, and have strictly prohibited it. However, the hearing stations and boats are still widespread. The French Concession police recently cracked down on the main agency, and the hearing stations and boats should have disappeared. However, these people's desire to cheat money has not died, and they have now reorganized. They have only moved the gambling location to avoid attention, and the hearing stations and boats are also active as before. The hearing station at No. 74 Lloyd Road was run by Yin Baosheng and his wife, Yin Yan, both from Ningbo.

<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Commercial Press Labor Union convened its first meeting yesterday at 10:00 AM, with 106 cadres from various departments and 16 members of the preparatory committee attending, along with Instructor Hou Dachun from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Representative Yang Youwang from the Sixth District Party Headquarters for guidance. Presided over by Wang Wenhua, the meeting began with formal greetings and introductions of all preparatory committee members and departmental cadres. Wang Wenhua then reported on the purpose of the meeting, explained the reasons for reorganizing the labor union as ordered by the Municipal Party Headquarters, and detailed the handover process. He also elaborated on the future work plan of the preparatory committee and the key points to be emphasized, hoping that all cadres would unite and assist the preparatory committee during this transition period for the sake of the entire labor union and the interests of all colleagues, in order to complete the reorganization work. Since taking over, the preparatory committee has been actively seeking solutions to various issues such as salary increases and wages and bonuses during the slowdown period, all of which are in progress. Subsequently, Qian Tingliang reported on the labor union's finances, which were in dire straits. Zhang Jinhong and Wu Chengpei reported on the handover of the education committee and the economic situation of the children's school, with teachers' salaries for May still unsettled. Bian Zhongliang reported on the handover of the entertainment committee. After the reports, Instructor Hou Dachun from the Municipal Party Headquarters gave instructions, stating that the Municipal Party Headquarters' decision to reorganize the Commercial Press Labor Union was due to recent manipulation by a group of corrupt elements, which led to the union's declining status and endangered the interests of its members. He cited evidence of plotting against the government, attempting to cause disturbances, accepting bribes, and selling out fellow workers, all of which occurred within the Commercial Press Labor Union. The union's reputation in society was almost bankrupt. Internal affairs, such as demands for rice subsidies, deliberate slowdowns, and the presence of Communist spies, were ignored. If this continued, the union would be in danger. To maintain social order, protect domestic industries, safeguard the interests of members, and promote the overall development of the labor movement, the Commercial Press Labor Union had to be reorganized. He urged everyone to take responsibility, cooperate with the preparatory committee, and work together. The party headquarters would fully assist in resolving issues such as compensation for slowdown wages and ongoing salary increases. The preparatory committee would absolutely guarantee the past, present, and future welfare of all members. Rumors of mass layoffs were baseless and spread by reactionaries to incite unrest. The party headquarters would punish only the main culprits, while other workers would be absolutely protected. He hoped everyone would work with peace of mind. Due to time constraints, the representative from the District Party Headquarters did not provide guidance. The chairman then adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>The Seamen's Union: Edison, the Norwegian owner of the ship "Luanping," violated the contract by dismissing 25 Chinese workers, including Liu Sheng.

The shipowner has now concealed the facts and the Norwegian consul in Shanghai is protecting him, saying he will only give one month's salary and the Chinese workers must leave the ship. However, the original contract was signed on March 21st of this year for a period of six months, with more than four months remaining. The union and Liu Sheng are dissatisfied. Later, the shipowner verbally asked Liu Sheng and others to return to work, but there were concerns that they would be forcibly dismissed again in a place without a seamen's union. Because the shipowner had previously broken the contract, the union believed it would be difficult to prevent him from going back on his word again. When the union asked the Norwegian consul in Shanghai to sign a guarantee, he refused. Therefore, both the union and the workers believed he was not sincere and could not return to work. Yesterday, the shipowner even threatened the union staff with force at the consulate. The union believes that this Norwegian official and businessman is relying on imperialism to oppress Chinese workers too much. It has copied the contract, detailed the case, and submitted it to the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as to the Jianghai Customs to detain the ship for negotiation. The Second and Third District Police Departments of Shanghai have been instructed that if the shipowner uses violence, they should immediately send police to intervene, arrest him, and hand him over to our government for strict punishment according to the law, as a warning to those foreigners who oppress and insult Chinese people and humiliate the nation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: On the 18th of this month, the newspaper published an article about Peng Liren and Liu Jiping, district chiefs of the Second District, planning to raise funds to repair Zou Rong's tomb. Yesterday, I visited Mr. Ji's residence and he said that he had not heard of this matter, and that the National Government had already ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to repair the Zou martyr's tomb, which was recently completed. We fear that there may be misunderstandings in all circles, so we make a special statement on his behalf. We hope that the editor will publish the attached letter to clarify the facts.

<h3>Introduction (Chong Gan)</h3>
<p>The grand 9th Far Eastern Games will open in Tokyo this afternoon. Participants include male and female athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, and India, totaling over 400. They will compete fiercely on the sports field, making it a rare and grand event. This year's games are more advanced than previous ones in three aspects: first, the scope has expanded with India's participation; second, the number of women's demonstration events has increased, not limited to volleyball and tennis; and third, athletes from China, Japan, and the Philippines have made significant progress in their skills. Therefore, this year's games will surely attract attention from countries around the world, and once they participate in world sports, it will not be difficult to gain a superior position.</p>
<p>Looking at the strengths of the four countries, India has only sent four athletes, aiming to connect international relations and not focusing on victory or defeat. Japan is sure to win the eight championship titles in track and field, all-around, and swimming. The Chinese football team will definitely return in triumph, and there is a good chance for basketball and volleyball. For tennis and baseball, Japan is sending second-rate players because their top athletes are participating in the Davis Cup. Qiu Lin from our country is skilled and can compete with Japan. As for baseball, our country is sending a Hawaiian Chinese team, which is exceptionally strong and a formidable enemy to Japan. The Philippines will surely perform well in various competitions, but there is little hope for championships. Therefore, considering the overall situation, Japan is confident of winning the overall championship due to its large talent pool and being well-rested. However, China also has sufficient strength and great prospects. Strive on, our Chinese team!</p>
<p>Although our Chinese track and field skills are not as good as Japan and the Philippines, we are also making rapid progress. This year's results should exceed the previous ones. There are also strong athletes participating in women's track and field demonstrations. Sun Guiyun in Japan has already attracted much attention. There are two athletes from Hong Kong going for women's swimming demonstrations. All of these are good signs for China. How can we not celebrate?</p>
<p>However, the health of the people does not depend on a small number of athletes, and the glory of the nation is not limited to sports championships. If our people want to be strong, they should popularize beneficial outdoor sports and eliminate meaningless indoor entertainment. Regardless of gender or age, everyone should have adequate exercise every day. In this way, the people of the whole country will be healthy, and special talents will be easily produced. Therefore, on the opening day of this year's Far Eastern Games, the reporter hopes that the Chinese athletes will win championships and that sports can be popularized throughout the country.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Venue</h3>

<p>Tokyo Electric News, 23rd of this newspaper. Since arriving in the East, our country's male and female athletes have been practicing for several days, and all are in high spirits, with soaring ambitions, preparing to exert their best abilities, compete for a day of dominance, and win honor for the country. Therefore, the spirit of this battle is very good.</p>

<h3>Liu Changchun's Injury Not Healed</h3>
<p>Withdraws from 100m and 200m</p>
<p>Only Participates in the 400m Run</p>
<p>｜Hope for Our Country's Track and Field Diminishes｜</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric News, 23rd of this newspaper. The reporter met Liu Changchun today. According to the coach, since his leg muscle was injured in Shanghai and has not fully recovered, if he does not consider his condition and participates in too many events, he may re-injure his leg. Therefore, it has been decided that he will only try the 400m race and withdraw from the 100m and 200m races. He feels very regretful about this unavoidable setback, and the hope for our country's track and field is diminished as a result.</p>
<h3>Chinese Baseball is Formidable</h3>
<p>｜Hope to Win the Championship｜</p>
<p>｜Japan Considers Us a Strong Enemy｜</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric News, 23rd of this newspaper. Japan is secretly quite afraid of our country's baseball team, because this time several strong players have joined, and the strength is strong. The team members each have talents in accurate pitching, effective hitting, and agile base running. In the future, if our country's athletes can compete smoothly, it is also hoped that they can win the championship. Therefore, Japan considers our country the most powerful rival this time.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Final Predictions</h3>
<p>1500m····China and the Philippines have little hope</p>
<p>High Jump············Japan and the Philippines will definitely compete fiercely</p>
<p>Li Zhongsan········Has an opportunity to score</p>
<p>Long Jump············Afraid that Japan will win completely</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric News, 23rd of this newspaper. Predictions for this track and field competition. In the 1500m, Japanese athlete Tsuda has a record of 4 minutes 9 seconds and 2 tenths, and Japanese athletes Kitamoto and Kakutani can also occupy the top three positions. Chinese athlete Jiang Yunlong and Philippine athlete Yetair have little hope. In the high jump, Philippine athlete Doripigo has a record of 1 meter 946, and Japanese athletes are also determined to wash away the shame of losing both previous battles and will have a fierce competition that will be very interesting. If Chinese athlete Li Zhongsan can exceed his previous record, it will not be difficult for him to score a point for China. Indian athlete Yusef is like a dark horse in horse racing and is difficult to predict. In the long jump, Japanese athlete Nanbu has a best record of 7 meters 06, and other athletes are also strong. It is feared that the top few will all be won by Japan. Judging from past results, Japan is in a superior position in track and field, and China and the Philippines have little chance of winning.</p>

<p>Comparison of the Strengths of the Four Countries (Victory Path)</p>
<h3>The Championship is a Deer Hunt for China and Japan</h3>
<p>The 9th Far Eastern Games, with Japan as the host, saw the construction of a grand venue in Tokyo, incurring substantial costs. Approximately 400 athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, and India are participating. The opening ceremony is scheduled for this afternoon at the Meiji Jingu Stadium, officiated by Prince Chichibu, marking an unprecedented grand event in Far Eastern international relations. Each of the four participating nations possesses unique strengths. India, a first-time participant, holds unknown potential, and their unexpected emergence could surprise the other three nations. However, due to a small delegation and limited participation in events, their chances of winning the overall championship are slim. This analysis examines the past performances of each nation and assesses current records to provide a comparative overview for the public.</p>
<p>(1) Soccer</p>
<p>Since the inception of the Far Eastern Games, except for the first edition, the soccer championship has consistently belonged to China. This is a source of immense pride for our nation. The Chinese people have always valued soccer, and its widespread popularity and superior performance are unmatched by Japan and the Philippines. This enduring dominance in Far Eastern soccer is well-deserved. Japan, having defeated the Philippines in the previous edition, has seen its ambition to seize the championship ignited. Three months prior to this year's games, they had already selected and assembled players for intensive training. Their skills have improved daily. They even defeated the HMS Crichton, a British ship that drew with Le Hua two years ago, which they took as a great honor. They claim to be a match for the Chinese team, with the Philippines posing no threat. While their claims may be exaggerated, their actual progress is noteworthy. The Philippines admits to being inferior to China but is determined to defeat Japan and retain their silver medal position. The Philippine team's talent is better than in previous years, making their strength comparable to Japan's. As for the long-reigning champion, China, its composition remains as elite as ever, with a solid and impenetrable core, ensuring peace of mind. The wing players are second to none in the Far East, and the three midfielders are also quite skilled. If Li Huitang can recover from his swelling and play, aided by Sun Jinshun and Dai Linjing, scoring goals will seem like taking things from a bag. Even without Li Huitang, the Chinese team's overall skill makes winning the championship a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>(2) Basketball</p>
<p>The Philippines is to basketball what China is to soccer, possessing profound expertise. In the eight previous editions of the games, the championship belonged to the Philippines seven times. They have the highest hopes for the basketball championship this year, but acknowledging China's rapid progress in basketball, they dare not boast of a guaranteed victory. The talent on the Chinese basketball team is better than in any previous year. The "Five Tigers" of Nankai, along with famous players from Beiping and Shanghai, under the experienced guidance of Dong Shouyi, make the team's performance highly anticipated. Defeating the Philippines should not be difficult, and defeating Japan should pose no problem. Japan has also been preparing for basketball. However, due to their lack of attention to it in the past, even with temporary training, they will find it difficult to match the elite players of China and the Philippines. They also attribute their previous failures to being too short. This time, they have selected players based on height and weight, demonstrating a commendable spirit of progress.</p>
<p>(3) Volleyball</p>
<p>This championship has been shared equally between China and the Philippines. Of the eight editions of the games, each nation has won half. The location often dictates the victor, with the Philippines winning when hosted in the Philippines and China winning when hosted in China. This likely involves a psychological element. Although difficult to predict the outcome this time, as the games are held in Japan, the rapid progress of the Chinese team's skills and the abundance of talent put them above the Philippines. Reclaiming the championship is likely. Japan has been absent from the volleyball competition in five of the eight editions of the games. In the three times they participated, they suffered defeats each time, their actual strength being far weaker than China and the Philippines. Since March of this year, they have been selecting outstanding individuals from across the country for intensive training, determined to wipe out the shame. While they have little confidence in winning, they will not be easily defeated.</p>
<p>(4) Tennis</p>
<p>In the previous edition, Chinese players Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai defeated the Philippines and Japan to win the championship, a feat still spoken of with admiration. The representatives this year are still Lin and Qiu. However, times have changed. Those who were previously defeated by us may now defeat us. In early February of this year, Japan's Sato and Bui defeated Lin Baohua at a carnival held in the Philippines. This is clear evidence. This year, Japan's top players have gone to Europe to participate in the Davis Cup, confident that their second-tier players are sufficient to handle China and the Philippines. The participating players are Sato and Bui in singles and Yamagishi and Shimura in doubles. Recently, Bui, Yamagishi, and Shimura have suffered repeated defeats domestically, drawing criticism. The expectations for the Japanese championship have gradually decreased, while those for China have increased. Japan and the Philippines are most apprehensive of Qiu's skills, as he has shed his impetuosity and become highly skilled. The Philippines has a respectable tennis record in the games, but they have not progressed recently and have been repeatedly surpassed by China and Japan. It is unlikely they will win the championship this time. The result will likely be either Japan or China, and the outcome will significantly impact the overall championship for the two nations.</p>
<p>(5) Baseball</p>
<p>In recent years, the baseball championship has been dominated by the Philippines and Japan. In the previous edition, the performance of the overseas Chinese representatives from Honolulu surprised both Japan and the Philippines, changing their previous attitude of disdain. This year, Japan, with Keio University at its core and other skilled players added, has formed a strong and invincible team. However, they dare not be overly confident in winning the championship, as they have something to fear. Their strong rival is no longer the Philippines, but China. This year, the Philippine baseball team consists mainly of players selected from the customs bureau and various universities. They have undergone rigorous training, and their skills are considerably impressive. However, they are slightly inferior compared to China and Japan, making their championship hopes unlikely. As for the highly anticipated Chinese baseball team, they have an abundance of skilled players. Their offensive, defensive, pitching, and batting skills are all well-honed and powerful, causing concern for Japan and the Philippines. This time on the diamond, the three nations will have a fierce competition. The outcome is of utmost importance, and the overall championship for China and Japan may hinge on it.</p>
<p>(6) Swimming</p>
<p>This sport is still in its infancy in China. In the second edition of the games, China shone brightly, taking the lead. The third edition was also commendable, but due to a lack of promotion, no further progress was seen. Japan and the Philippines have made rapid advances, widening the gap significantly. In the previous edition, Singaporean overseas Chinese returned to serve the country, but they still found it difficult to compete. The talent this year is similar to before, making failure inevitable. Japan's swimming performance is truly astonishing. The reason for their failure in the previous edition was that Japan sent its top five swimmers to participate in the international swimming competition held in Honolulu, USA, and sent second-tier swimmers to participate in the Far Eastern Games, which they regretted as a great defeat. This year, they declined to participate in overseas competitions and focused solely on preparing to reclaim the championship. Judging by the overall situation, they will likely succeed. In the past, the two nations each had their strengths, with the Philippines excelling in short distances and Japan excelling in long distances. Now, Japan is strong in both short and long distances. Takashi and Sada are capable of competing with the Philippines' famous players, Anli and Woolgar, for the top spot in short distances. In long distances, Japanese talent is even more outstanding, with Makino and Tsuruta being the best. The Philippines' Erde will not be able to dominate as he did in the previous edition. In short, Japan is determined to win swimming, and they will likely achieve their goal. As for the Philippines, the biggest reason for their disappointment this time is that nine of their excellent swimmers announced their withdrawal during the preliminaries.</p>
<p>(7) All-Around Sports</p>
<p>This event began in the previous edition, with Japan taking the lead. This year, in its second edition, Japan and the Philippines will have a fierce competition. Both sides have elite warriors in the pentathlon and decathlon, making it difficult to predict the outcome. Japan has the upper hand in the 800m and 1600m relays. On average, Japan has a 70-80% chance of winning, while the Philippines has only a 20-30% chance. China has very little hope, but the performance of the newly joined India is unknown.</p>
<p>(8) Track and Field</p>
<p>China has very little confidence in track and field. In the past, when held in China, the only hope was for the athletes to do their best and deliver a good performance. This time, there are more talented athletes. While winning the championship is unlikely, scoring points is possible and should not result in another shutout like in the previous edition. Based on the performance records of the three nations this year, Liu Changchun in the 400m and Li Zhongsan in the high jump may be able to score one or two points. The Philippines has average talent in all events, making it difficult to compete with Japan for the top spot. Even in the short distances that they are good at, Japan has comparable results. Judging from this, Japan's chances of winning track and field are as certain as China's chances of winning soccer. India is participating with four athletes, and their performance is unknown. Perhaps they will make a surprising impact.</p>

<h3>Competition Methods</h3>
<p>A total of eight championships</p>
<p>The one with the most wins the overall championship</p>
<p>Equal number of championships between two countries</p>
<p>The number of runners-up determines the overall championship</p>
<p>| Women's events are exhibitions |</p>
<p>| Not related to the championship |</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games initially used a scoring system, combining all sports into a single championship, with the overall score determining the order of victory for each nation. Later, a championship system was adopted based on the type of sport. For example, there are currently eight sports, so eight championships were established, namely: (1) Track and Field Championship, (2) All-Around Championship, (3) Swimming Championship, (4) Soccer Championship, (5) Basketball Championship, (6) Volleyball Championship, (7) Baseball Championship, and (8) Tennis Championship. The number of championships won determines the ranking of each nation's victory or defeat. However, if two or more nations have an equal number of championships, the nation with the most second-place finishes in all events will be the overall champion of the Games. Other events, such as women's competitions, are exhibition matches and are not counted in the official championship. Therefore, although they are called championships, their results do not affect the overall victory or defeat of the Games.</p>
<p>(1) The Track and Field Championship is divided into fifteen events: (1) 100m, (2) 200m, (3) 400m, (4) 800m, (5) 1500m, (6) 10000m, (7) 110m Hurdles, (8) 200m Hurdles, (9) High Jump, (10) Long Jump, (11) Triple Jump, (12) Pole Vault, (13) Shot Put (12 lbs), (14) Javelin Throw, (15) Discus Throw. Four places are recorded for each event, with the scoring method being 5 points for the first place, 3 points for the second place, 2 points for the third place, and 1 point for the fourth place. The one with the highest total score in the fifteen events wins the championship.</p>
<p>(2) The All-Around Championship includes five events, ten events, 800m relay race (4×200Meters), and 1600m relay race (4×4Meters). This has been implemented since the 8th Games. Four places are recorded for the five-event and ten-event competitions, with 10 points for the first place, 6 points for the second place, 4 points for the third place, and 2 points for the fourth place. For the two relay races, regardless of the number of participating countries, the four best teams are recorded, and the scoring method is the same as the five-event and ten-event competitions. The one with the highest total score in the four events wins the championship.</p>
<p>(3) The Swimming Championship is divided into 50m Freestyle, 100m Freestyle, 400m Freestyle, 1500m Freestyle, 100m Backstroke, 200m Breaststroke, and 200m Medley Relay. Four places are recorded for the first six events, and the scoring method is the same as track and field. For the last event, the top four teams are recorded, and the scores are doubled. The one with the highest total score in the seven events wins the championship.</p>
<p>(4) The Soccer Championship adopts a single round-robin system, with each country playing each other once. For example, if China, Japan, and the Philippines participate, there will be a match between China and Japan, a match between the Philippines and Japan, and a match between the Philippines and China, for a total of three matches. Two points are awarded for a win, and zero points are awarded for a loss. The one with the most points wins the championship. If the result of a match between two teams is a draw, the match will be extended for 30 minutes, with the teams switching directions every 15 minutes, to determine the winner. If each of the three countries wins once, resulting in a three-way tie, a rematch will be held to determine the championship.</p>
<p>(5) The Basketball Championship adopts a double round-robin system, with each country playing each other twice, for a total of six matches. The championship is calculated using a scoring method, simply put, the one with the most wins wins the championship.</p>
<p>(6) The Volleyball Championship uses the same competition and scoring methods as basketball.</p>
<p>(7) The Baseball Championship uses the same competition and scoring methods as basketball.</p>
<p>(8) The Tennis Championship stipulates that the winner of the previous edition gets a "Bye" (i.e., advances directly), so this year, Japan and the Philippines must first compete, and the winner will then compete against China in the final. The competition method adopts the Davis Cup system, divided into four singles matches and one doubles match. The one who wins three of the five matches wins. However, only two singles players are allowed, and the allocation of the four matches is as follows: (1) First singles vs. opponent's second singles, (2) Second singles vs. opponent's first singles, (3) First singles vs. opponent's first singles, (4) Second singles vs. opponent's second singles. This is done in rotation. As for the doubles players, they can be represented by the two singles players, or two other players can be sent.</p>

<h3>Championship Is Being Contested Between China And Japan</h3>
<p>Japan, as the host country for the ninth Far Eastern Games, has constructed a stadium in Tokyo, incurring significant expenses. Approximately 400 athletes from China, Japan, the Philippines, and India are participating. The opening ceremony is scheduled for this afternoon at the Meiji Jingu Stadium, officiated by Prince Chichibu, marking an unprecedented grand event in Far Eastern international relations. Each of the four participating nations has its strengths. India is participating for the first time, and their performance is difficult to predict. Their unexpected emergence may surprise the three countries. As they are limited in numbers and participating in few events, there is no hope for them to seize the championship. This article examines the results in past games of each country and current records, and compares them for the reference of people across the nation.</p>
<p>(1) Soccer</p>
<p>Since the inception of the Far Eastern Games, the soccer championship has gone to China in every year except the first. This is the greatest honor of our country. Our people value soccer, and its popularity and high achievements are unparalleled by Japan and the Philippines. There are good reasons why we maintain the soccer championship in East Asia. Japan defeated the Philippines in the last games, and the ambition to seize the championship is rising. Three months ago, they had chosen and trained players, and have improved their skills every day. They defeated the HMS Crichton which had tied with Le Hua two years ago, which they regard as a great honor. They say that they are a match for the China team, and the Philippines is not a match for them. There is exaggeration in their words, but their actual progress is worth noting. The Philippines said that they know they are inferior to China, but they will definitely defeat Japan and retain their second place. The team from the Philippines is better than in the past, therefore the Philippines and Japan are of comparable strength. China, the team with the longest winning streak, is composed of the same elite troops as in the past. Their internal structure is solid and tight, so we can be worry-free. The talent on both wings is unmatched in the Far East. The three midfielders are also</p>
<h3>Japanese Don't Include Foreign Minister's Oration</h3>
<p>Acting Representative Jiang deems it insulting behavior</p>
<p>Set a deadline for official apology by 8 AM this morning</p>
<p>Or the Chinese team will withdraw from the competition</p>
<p>This morning, our Tokyo correspondent reports that the Chinese Embassy received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day before. Acting Representative Jiang will read the oration on behalf of Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting at the opening ceremony this afternoon. Acting Representative Jiang informed Mr. Kishii Seiichi, Chairman of the Japan Athletic Association, about this matter yesterday morning. Mr. Kishii replied with an angry tone that the time was too late and the oration cannot be included in the order of events. Acting Representative Jiang deemed this insulting and was very angry. He immediately discussed the matter with Hao Boyang and the Japan Athletic Association, demanding a formal apology and the inclusion of Foreign Minister Wang's oration in the order of events. The deadline for response is 8:00 AM this morning. If they don't, the Chinese team will withdraw from the competition. However, the responsible people in our delegation do not agree with this radical action, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>

<p>very capable. If Li Huitang can recover from swelling and join the game, combined with Sun Jinshun and Dai Linjing, scoring will be as easy as taking things from a bag. Even if Li isn't there, comparing the skills of the entire Chinese team makes seizing the championship a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>(2) Basketball</p>
<p>The Philippines is to basketball what China is to soccer. Their achievements are very deep. Of the eight games that were held, the Philippines won the championship in seven of them. They have the highest hopes for the basketball championship this year. Aware of the rapid progress of basketball in China, they dare not be overconfident of seizing the championship. The talent on the basketball team from China is better than in any other year. The five tigers of Nankai, along with famous players from Beiping and Shanghai, combined with the rich experience of Dong Shouyi as a coach, the result of the whole team is something to look forward to. Defeating the Philippines should not be difficult, and there will be no problem defeating Japan. Japan has also been preparing for the basketball event. Since they do not usually pay much attention to it, they will be hard-pressed to defeat the elite teams of China and the Philippines, even with temporary training. They also acknowledge that previous failures were due to short heights, and this time they have selected players based on height and weight, which is a welcome sign of progress.</p>
<p>(3) Volleyball</p>
<p>This championship has been rotated between China and the Philippines. Of the eight games that have been held, each country has occupied half. The victory is always determined by the geography. The Philippines will win if it's in the Philippines, and China will win if it's in China. This also involves a psychological factor. Although it is difficult to predict the outcome this time, since it is held in Japan, the volleyball skills of the team from China has rapidly improved, and they have more talented players, which is definitely above the Philippines. Taking the championship is a definite possibility. Japan has been absent from the volleyball event five times since the games were established. They have participated three times, and have suffered defeat each time. Their real strength is weak and far below China and the Philippines. They started selecting outstanding people from all over the country in March this year and have been training for a long time with the firm intention of wiping out the shame. It is difficult to win, but it won't be easy to defeat them either.</p>
<p>(4) Net Ball</p>
<p>In the previous games, Chinese players Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai repeatedly defeated the Philippines and Japan to seize the championship, creating a situation never seen before in the games, which is still praised today. The representatives in this event are still Lin and Qiu. However, things are different now. Those who used to be defeated by us may now be defeated by others. Japan's Sato and Bui defeated Lin Baohua at the carnival held on the island of the Philippines in early February this year, which is clear evidence of this. This year, Japan's first-class players have gone to Europe to participate in the Davis Cup, knowing that their second-class talent is enough to deal with China and the Philippines. The players participating in the singles matches are Sato and Bui, and the doubles players are Yamagishi and Shimura. Recently, Bui, Yamagishi, and Shimura have repeatedly failed domestically and have been criticized. The call for the championship from Japan has been declining, while the expectation for China has been rising. Japan and the Philippines fear the skills of Qiu the most, as he has shed all impetuosity and his skills are now pure and refined. The tennis results from the Philippines have a respectable position in the games. They have not progressed recently and have repeatedly been surpassed by China and Japan. This championship is unlikely to be won. The result will be either Japan or China, and the victory or defeat will have a significant impact on the overall championship for the two countries.</p>
<p>The situation of Philippine athletes arriving in Japan by special ship</p>
<p>(5) Baseball</p>
<p>In recent years, the baseball championship has become something that Japan and the Philippines have in their pockets. In the previous games, the performances of the Chinese representatives from Honolulu surprised Japan and the Philippines, changing their previous attitude of contempt. This year, Japan has built a team around Keio University, adding other good players, and it is a strong and invincible force. However, they are afraid of something and do not dare to be overly confident of winning the championship. Their strong rival is no longer the Philippines, but China. The baseball team from the Philippines has chosen many players from the Customs Bureau and various universities, and has been training hard. Their skills are impressive, but they are slightly inferior to China and Japan. Their hopes for the championship are unlikely to be realized. The baseball team from China, which is the focus of public attention, has many good players. Their offensive, defensive, pitching, and hitting skills are all refined and powerful, causing Japan and the Philippines to sit up and take notice. On the diamond this time, the three countries will have a fierce battle, and the victory or defeat is very important. The overall championship issue between China and Japan may depend on it.</p>
<p>(6) Swimming</p>
<p>This sport is still in its infancy in China. China did very well at the second games, gaining a high lead. The third games were also acceptable, but the progress was not seen as the efforts to promote it were weak. The second countries of Japan and the Philippines have been making rapid progress, therefore the difference has been widening. In the last games, Singaporean overseas Chinese returned to serve the country, but it was still difficult to compete with other countries. The talent in this event is similar to before, so defeat is inevitable. Japan's swimming achievements are amazing. The reason for their failure in the last games was that Japan sent their five elite players to participate in the International Swimming Championships held in Honolulu, USA, and the second-class players participated in the Far Eastern Games, which they considered to be regrettable. This year, they declined to participate in overseas competitions and focused on winning back the championship, which seems like will come true. In the past, both countries had their own strengths. The Philippines were good at short distances, and Japan were good at long distances. Now, Japan is good at both short and long distances. Takashihiko and Sada are able to compete with Anli and Woolgar, who are famous players from the Philippines, for the top spot in short distances, and Japan's talent is more outstanding in long distances. Makino and Tsuruta are leaders in this regard. The Philippine's Erde will not dominate as he did in the last games. In short, Japan has a twelve-point conviction of winning swimming. At that time, they will be able to achieve their wish. As for the greatest reason for the Philippines' disappointment this time, nine of their excellent players announced their withdrawal during the preliminaries.</p>
<p>(7) All-Around Sports</p>
<p>This sport started in the previous games, and Japan took the lead. There will be a fierce competition between Japan and the Philippines this time. Each side has its own elite soldiers in the pentathlon and decathlon. It is difficult to predict the outcome. Japan occupies the high ground in the 800m and 1600m relays. On average, Japan has a 70-80% certainty, while the Philippines only has 20-30%. China has very little hope, but we don't know how the new member</p>
<h3>Order to Close Sanmin and Sanyu Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau, based on multiple investigation reports, found that the Sanmin and Sanyu Elementary Schools on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession were corrupt in content. Recently, Chen Guohua, the principal of Sanmin Elementary School, also filed a complaint against the principal of Sanyu Elementary School for seducing his wife into adultery. After dispatching personnel for investigation, Chen's wife herself admitted the matter without hesitation. The Bureau deemed that neither school had been approved for establishment, and the individuals running both schools were of questionable conduct. To prevent them from misleading themselves and others, an order was issued to close the schools immediately. A letter was sent to the French Concession Police Department on the previous day for their attention. The original letter from the Shanghai Education Bureau to the French Concession Police Department is excerpted below:</p>
<p>To the Director,</p>
<p>According to reports from Chen Guohua, principal of the private Sanmin Elementary School, and Wu Qiyi, founder of the private Sanyu Elementary School, on the 13th and 14th of this month, two investigators from the French Concession Police Department, Fan and Zheng, came to the schools and declared that the Sanmin School in Xin Xin Li and the Sanyu School in Xi Lin Li must be closed within four days. We were shocked and bewildered upon hearing this and specially request you to reconsider.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Sanmin Elementary School in Xin Xin Li has been operating for years but has not followed regulations to apply for establishment. The content is corrupt, the facilities are simple, and the principal, Chen Guohua, is of questionable conduct and has been found to solicit donations under false pretenses. Therefore, an order to close the school should be issued. Wu Qiyi, the founder of the Sanyu Elementary School in Xi Lin Li, was originally a teacher at the Sanmin Elementary School. Recently, he had disagreements with Principal Chen and left to establish Sanyu Elementary School, causing a major dispute. Wu Qiyi's character is morally bankrupt and lacks the qualities of a teacher. According to regulations, a board of directors should be established and an application for establishment submitted in order before starting a school. The private Sanyu Elementary School has not followed regulations and should be closed to prevent misleading themselves and others.</p>
<p>In addition to ordering the two schools to close immediately, we are sending this letter for your attention. We trust in your cooperation.</p>

<p>1. Chairman Jiang Wenyu delivered the opening remarks. 2. Director Dr. Liu Zhanen reported on the recent situation of vocational guidance in China. 3. Deputy Director Pan Yangyao reported on the recent work of the Vocational Guidance Center, divided into (1) Guidance for further education, (2) Employment guidance, (3) Service guidance, (4) Registration and introduction, (5) Vocational training, (6) Lectures and talks, (7) Health and legal guidance, (8) Overseas vocational guidance, (9) Intelligence testing, (10) Editing publications. 4. Dr. Chen Qingshi proposed a plan to investigate the career ladder of people in the education sector for research and analysis. (Decision) Amended and passed. (Chen Heqin suggested adding reorganization and asking if they are willing to take on the current position. Dr. Li Quanshi suggested adding asking if they are healthy. Shou Yicheng suggested adding asking if they consider this a lifelong career and whether they have concurrent jobs) 5. Dr. Shen Gongjian proposed a plan to assign professors and experts from various universities to organize departmental guidance meetings to discuss guidance methods for students entering domestic schools and studying abroad. (Decision) It is proposed to divide into three categories: individuals (such as learning performance, academic preparation, economic burden, etc.), schools (such as attention to characteristics, curriculum, equipment, expenses, etc.), and society (occupational trends, employment opportunities, etc.). Experts from various departments will be hired to hold discussions and formulate guidance plans in several sessions (provisionally set for eight categories: education, psychology, politics, economics, law, industry, commerce, agriculture, and medicine). 6. Dr. Chen Qingshi proposed verifying whether the career self-assessment forms filled out by students entering schools and seeking employment are accurate. Dr. Liao Maoru suggested that in addition to self-assessment, friends, teachers, and parents should be asked to criticize or use testing methods to verify the degree of difference. Chen Heqin and Chen Qingshi suggested giving examples of each item to show the criteria. Chen Binhe said that the usage number of one million yuan felt too big. Shou Yicheng said that self-assessment of character should be changed to three categories: special strengths, advantages, and average. 7. Discussing and encouraging various universities, vocational schools, and secondary schools to increase the number of work-study students so that young people without the means to pursue further education can have opportunities to advance. Resolved: The center will send letters to various schools for discussion and encouragement. 8. Discussing and encouraging various organizations and industrialists to give priority to graduates of various vocational schools. Qian Xinzhi expressed opinions and hopes: (1) Graduates are willing to start small and accept low salaries, (2) More practical opportunities outside of coursework, (3) Pay attention to the training of middle and lower-level talents, (4) Focus on service ethics and practical training. Xu Yongzuo said that the shortcomings of various organizations in employing students should be sought first as a reference for training talents. Liao Maoru expressed opinions, saying that the reason why students from various schools are not trusted by the industrial sector lies in the separation. It is best to imitate the special recruitment of students from Wuxi Shenxin Factory to enter the factory to learn. In the future, various vocational schools can discuss with various factories, banks, and companies to establish short-term training courses to cultivate talents who are suitable for professional needs, personality, knowledge, and service conditions, so that students can find employment more easily. 9. How to promote and expand the development of new outlets for unemployed people. Jiang Wenyu advocated starting with publicity and investigation and organizing a development education research association. Chen Binhe and Qian Xinzhi advocated adopting the Japanese spirit and imitating the method of students from Dongwen College to enter the interior of China to investigate (all customs, products, local dialects, organizations, etc. must be studied) and using winter and summer vacations to travel to various places. Bo Xulun advocated first forming an investigation team to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the Northeast and establishing vocational guidance agencies in the Northeast first, with disaster relief funds allocated for immigration expenses, and the society should consult with the government to formulate a specific plan. Shou Yicheng believed that the term development was inappropriate and advocated changing it to the Xingye movement. Li Quanshi, Chen Heqin, and Pan Yangyao advocated changing it to the Shiban movement. Jiang Wenyu and Yang Weiyu advocated changing it to the Bianye movement. Lu Sheng San advocated changing it to the reclamation movement. After discussion, the comrades organized a border promotion association, and Liu Zhanen, Pan Xulun, Qian Xinzhi, Shou Yicheng, Li Quanshi, Chen Heqin, Lu Sheng San, Ni Wenya, Jiang Wenyu, Chen Binhe, and Huang Jingwan were elected to prepare for it.</p>

<h3>The Literacy Movement in the County is Postponed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Literacy Movement Conference was previously scheduled to be held in various districts from the 20th to the 25th of this month. The county party headquarters, county government, and county education bureau all sent special personnel to participate. However, due to the busy farming season and unfavorable weather, the county government plans to wait until the farming is slightly less busy, before the autumn semester begins at schools, to prepare and hold another event. The county magistrate has also ordered the district chiefs to continue to supervise the township chiefs in following the Literacy Movement Outline issued by the department and implement it diligently at all times.</p>

<h3>In Praise of Mrs. Hoover's Hospitality by Liu Zhi</h3>
<p>Mrs. Hoover, the wife of the American president, is skilled in socializing and fond of guests. She lived in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) in the past, and many Chinese people knew her. Since her husband was elected head of state, Mrs. Hoover has been known as the First Lady of the United States. Her habit of hospitality remains as usual. Therefore, there are often guests in the White House. Mrs. Hoover's hospitality is outstanding. Mrs. Hoover always dines with her husband every day, and often has several guests at the same table. It has been like this for a year. Although the food may not be rich and the wine may not be fine, the customs are eliminated and they forget the host and guests with each other. Compared with formal banquets, it feels like the cumbersome etiquette cannot give the pleasure of eating and drinking. Every Sunday evening, she always invites a dozen female friends to a small banquet in the palace. After the wine has been consumed and ears have been heated, they will try new songs and dance the foxtrot. The joy is so good that the deep darkness of the night is completely forgotten. In addition to Sundays, there are occasional temporary gatherings. It is still remembered that at Christmas last year, Little Hoover rushed back from his post. (Little Hoover is an engineer at a radio station) Mrs. Hoover gave a banquet to welcome him. However, there was no one to accompany him in a hurry, so she invited people everywhere by telephone. For a time, the sound of the doorbell was Ding Ding. The endlessness of a few hours is also an interesting thing that has never happened in the White House. Mrs. Hoover attaches great importance to musicians. She has personally written words of admiration and worship, which are personally awarded. Those who get it are regarded as the supreme honor. Also, at the banquet, Mrs. Hoover always picks the famous flowers in the palace and places them in front of the female guests' seats. The fresh fragrance and bright colors are enough to make the female guests more beautiful.</p>
<h3>Fan Guang's Poem Praising Chongguang by Yunfang</h3>
<p>Fan Guang, courtesy name Zhenchu, is from Jinyun in Zhejiang. He recently acted as an agent of foreign affairs and developed close ties with Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Rutang, ranking among the elite. He is an efficient person, appearing gentle like a scholar, and excels in poetry. In recent years, he has lived in the north and often composed poems. He is close to figures such as Minister of the Interior Zhang Wenhua, who is also skilled in poetry. They often exchange poems, which are brilliant and widely recited in the capital. The Japanese Ambassador to China, Chongguang, is fond of Chinese poetry and music, enjoying discussions about elegance. They became close friends upon meeting and often requested calligraphy. Ambassador Chongguang came to Beijing on the Summer Solstice to sign the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement. Foreign Minister Wang hosted a banquet at his official residence, and Fan composed a poem on the spot:</p>
<p>The immortal boat revisits Stone City,</p>
<p>A joyful alliance unites two nations.</p>
<p>China is now prosperous and strong,</p>
<p>May the borders be cleared from this point on.</p>
<p>The sun is high, Zhongfu shines like a star,</p>
<p>Flowers bloom on the Qin River, swords gleam bright.</p>
<p>Looking back, the spring light is vast and boundless,</p>
<p>Across the vast ocean, may we share the same glory.</p>
<p>A century of trade begins in peace,</p>
<p>Ninety days of spring gloom clear in a day.</p>
<p>Men welcome guests with summer poems,</p>
<p>Heaven seems pleased, letting the new sunshine in.</p>
<p>Scenic spots open to clear banquets,</p>
<p>The wine and dishes blend harmoniously, calming the soldiers.</p>
<p>From now on, may this grand event be widely spread,</p>
<p>May Jin and Qin be forever friendly, composing the same alliance.</p>
<p>Chongguang recited the poem aloud at the banquet, praising it repeatedly. It became a widely told story.</p>
<h3>The Old Tea Merchant of Northern Jiangxi by Diehua</h3>
<p>Fang Zhimin, the communist bandit of eastern Jiangxi, led his troops from Mopan Mountain to Rao Prefecture in northern Jiangxi this month, invading Dexing and Leping. They slaughtered and burned wherever they went, and their ferocity was unmatched. It was the time for the new tea in Dexing, and the mountain households had almost finished picking and producing it, storing it for sale. However, due to the bandits, tea merchants from far and wide dared not risk going to buy it. However, an old tea merchant named Liu from Yushan, who was over eighty years old, went alone with funds. He searched for new tea in the villages passed by the bandits, buying seven or eight pounds for each yuan. The mountain households feared being burned by the bandits, so they were willing to sell it cheaply at a reduced price. When the funds were exhausted, he loaded the tea and returned, making ten times the profit. Someone said to Liu, "You old man, you want money more than life. You're actually seeking fortune among the bandits?" Liu laughed and said, "It is precisely among the bandits that you can make a fortune. It's a matter of taking what others abandon. In a chaotic year, there are many opportunities for us merchants to make a fortune. It depends on luck and courage. I am eighty years old and not afraid of being killed by them. What is there to worry about?" At that time, everyone who heard it praised his bravery.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Day's Interesting Excursion by Cheng Zhizheng</h3>
<p>On May 18th, I had some free time after class, so I took a day's outing. There were many interesting things that happened, so I'll record one or two of them to commemorate the passing of time.</p>
<p>Tens of Thousands Watch the Duke</p>
<p>The day was the 30th anniversary of the Tongwen College. The day before, my friends Gu Xiuxiang and Wang Yanjin came to invite me, so I went there at nine in the morning. When I arrived, the school had been decorated with a new look. In the student dormitories, each one used a unique design to express political and social meanings. It was called the Dormitory Festival, and it was also a unique and refreshing event. The president of the college was the Japanese Duke Konoe Fumimaro. He had just come to Shanghai from Japan. At 11:00 AM, the opening ceremony of the statue of the former president Tsunekawa was held, and the duke unveiled it. The duke was only in his thirties, and it was said that he was of the same generation as the Japanese emperor. He was also a hereditary noble. When the duke gave the opening speech, tens of thousands of people watched and crowded together. But heaven did not favor us, and it began to drizzle. Therefore, the duke had to maintain his composure in the rain. Later, the foreign envoy Chongguang also gave a speech, in which he expressed great respect for the duke.</p>
<p>A Gathering of Heroes at Guanshengyuan</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I went to Guanshengyuan. The day was the graduation of Jianren, Zhihan, Wangzhi, Xiuxiang, and Mingshu from the Shanghai Alumni Association of Pingchao. For a time, Guanshengyuan was very lively. In addition to congratulating each other, there was also a lot of joking. It wasn't until 5:00 PM that the meeting ended.</p>
<p>Cheap Things Cannot Be Obtained</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily News had reported the day before that Yili Soda and Yantai Beer were being offered for free tasting at the New World, without restrictions and without taking a penny. For a time, many people went there after hearing the news. It happened to be the last day of the promotion. I went with Jianzhai and Zaice to try and get something for cheap. But when we arrived at the New World, it was packed with people and the iron gates were tightly closed. The sign said, "Full today, cannot accommodate more people." We were very disappointed. But there were still many people coming afterwards. The Shanghai people's love of getting cheap things can be said to be a common practice.</p>
<p>Unexpected Enjoying the Cool Air</p>
<p>Since the New World had turned us away, we wanted to find a quiet place to rest. Some suggested going to the park, but the price was too high, so we didn't take it. At this time, the racecourse was right in front of us. I suggested going in. My friend said that we might be rejected. I said, "Let's just try." So we went together. The journey was smooth, and we were not stopped. Besides being happy, we couldn't help but feel sad. The concession is our country's territory, but now the power is reversed, and the people of the country cannot freely visit the land of their own country. It is truly sad. The racecourse occupies a vast area, as far as the eye can see. The grass is like a carpet, and the green color is about to flow. And a corner of the painted building faintly resembles a mirage. The beauty of the evening scenery is truly unique. After taking a short walk around, we rested on a chair. Looking east, the towering buildings along Xizang Road reached into the clouds, and the lights shone from the windows like stars. To the south, the Great World had a myriad of sights, and to the north, the three companies stood tall and magnificent. The prosperity of Shanghai can be seen at a glance. At that time, the clear wind brushed our clothes, and the coolness attacked us. After sitting for a long time, the summer heat should have dissipated. So we walked out of the hall and returned to school.</p>
<h3>Reaction to The Merchant of Venice by Tiansheng</h3>
<p>The Drama Association's fourteenth public performance of Shakespeare's masterpiece "The Merchant of Venice" took place. It is said that the costumes, sets, props, etc. of 16th-century Italy were specially made, costing more than 3,000 yuan. This has aroused considerable repercussions from the general left-wing literary world. For example, a group of students at a certain university who call themselves proletarians openly posted slogans attacking the performance of such a drama with too strong aristocratic overtones. Another group of people strongly opposed this view and rose up to defend the Drama Association, saying that the greatness of the artistic field cannot be subject to any restrictions. The artist's slogan is that it has no age and no borders, and cannot be bound by any kind of thinking. The Drama Association's public performance of "The Merchant of Venice" seems to have triggered a debate in the art world. The members of the association can also be proud of it. It is said that the Drama Association's consistent goal is "to perform plays for the sake of performing plays." Therefore, it deeply dislikes being mixed into the whirlpool of debate, and waits for the natural resolution of the debate among the various factions. Still another group of people said that the Drama Association's "The Merchant of Venice" is a bit too lavish. The grandeur of the sets and the gaudiness of the costumes almost exceed the facilities of the Tianchan's "Investiture of the Gods" and the Dan Gui's "Astonishing Heaven and Earth." The entertainment color is too strong. In addition to being suitable for the appreciation of the concubine class, it has no value. The wording of the fault is even more incomprehensible. As far as the reporter knows, the costumes and sets of the play are based on the 16th-century Italian era, and what the script describes is the aristocracy of that time. The stage equipment of the Drama Association has not yet been able to exhaust the extravagance and splendor. The play is scheduled to be performed again today (Saturday) and tomorrow (Sunday) in the Central Auditorium. Those who sympathize with the Drama Association's views may wish to go and see it to verify whether what I said is true.</p>
<h3>Squirrel Funny Play Record by Lian Weng</h3>
<p>A young woman came to Tawei Lane in western Shanghai the other day. She had black hair and a red shirt, and was from northern Jiangsu. She carried a bag on her back, which wriggled. She held a small gong in her hand and made a clanging sound. A bystander asked her, and she said that the bag was full of squirrels, who could perform a play to make people laugh. One hundred copper coins would be enough. An enthusiast lent her a mat, and the woman released the bag and untied it. Six or seven squirrels came out.</p>
<p>The woman then took out four iron rings from the bag, which were connected without interruption. She hung them in the air, and the squirrels climbed up and tumbled down one after another. This was repeated three times. Each squirrel rose and fell like a butterfly through flowers. This was one scene. After the woman put away the ring, she took out a red cloth. There were squares drawn on the cloth. The squirrels first stood upright at the four corners, and then ran quickly tail to tail, circling in the squares without stepping outside. This was the fifth scene. The woman folded the red cloth into a bag and then took out an iron pole, which was inserted into two small balls. The squirrels did exercise on the balls, taking turns replacing each other. They were then scattered on the table, and the squirrels tossed them as a game, extremely agile. This combined two scenes into one scene. After the four scenes were finished, the woman took out pine nuts from her pocket to feed them. After feeding, she put them back in the bag, took the money, and left.</p>
<p>The onlookers said that the squirrels' acting was just for the sake of a few pine nuts. Aren't those who are played with because they seek food like these squirrels? Alas.</p>
<h3>Italian Wedding Rally · Autumn · Water</h3>
<p>Mussolini of Italy. One of the oddballs of the modern world. His thinking is exceptional. And his methods are even more ruthless. Recently, he has been vigorously promoting the family system in his country, saying that the future happiness of Italy depends entirely on individual families. His idea seems close to the ancient teachings of the State of Qi in our country. Earlier this month, a joint wedding was held in the Cathedral of San Giusto in Trieste, Italy. Seventy couples were married at the same time. Mussolini specially sent the leaders of the Fascist Party and governors of various provinces to the venue to witness the wedding. This huge wedding has a social and political flavor. The grand occasion is not difficult to imagine. After the seventy couples completed their vows, they went to Rome for a free honeymoon trip. Mussolini and the Pope will meet with them every day to show their support and encouragement.</p>
<p>European Travel Correspondence (55) · Liu · Haisu</p>
<p>Matisse's Sixtieth Birthday (B)</p>
<p>Matisse's art is a radiant, consistent, and flawless complete art. This is also universally praised by Europeans today. Even people who don't have much knowledge of painting can immediately recognize the flavor of Matisse's paintings. Because his pictures all have their inimitable characteristics. His works project a deeper level of his life and physique. In other words, when we view his paintings, it is like seeing a projection of himself. Just as the white peaks of Switzerland display their clear or solemn posture in the heart of Lake Geneva where they are projected. Everything in his works is the function of form, the essence of aesthetics. There are no tragic or comedic records, no gentle or serious expressions, and no revelation of any emotion. The application of pure artistic imagination to reality has never been more thorough than his. Each of his canvases is a pure scene, a Spectacle, something to be watched. The optical is realized on the canvas, the synthesis of visual sensations. All of these, after passing through our retinas and entering our minds, weave a crisp intoxication and clear inspiration. There are no extravagant or vague and chaotic elements. Many people say that this foundation is the effect of the spirit. Of course. Originally, the existence of "spirit" can also be found in this master's sketches, Dessins. But the "laws" he describes cannot be found. This is precisely the element that creates this unique and innovative art. And it becomes something strange and awkward. This is great, pure art. But he is still there, endlessly and infinitely creating as a whole. He is devoid of religion, compassion, heroic qualities, and the general human ambition for greatness. His spirit creates the purpose of the canvas itself according to its own unique rhythm. And it is the greatest victory for a product of wisdom in the history of modern art.</p>
<p>In 1896, Matisse sent thirteen paintings to the Salon du Champ de Mars. Since then, his paintings have caused a lot of controversy. However, only four or five of the paintings exhibited in this exhibition were works before 1917. More than a dozen of them are works after the war. The rest are recent works. However, there is no essential difference between his old and recent works. But there is still a strong connection. However, what he thought in the past does not have to be the same as today. The root of that thought will not change. But each person's own thought is constantly evolving. The method of expression has also changed.</p>

Yuan Maoyong and overdrafts bought in, while Zhifengyong, Xiangyu, Hengxingyuan, etc. all sold out. Since it was reported that the National Government had not issued an order on the case of collecting taxes in cash in the early market, the news spread and people's hearts were uplifted. Large strips remained unchanged. Although the silver market rose, it was unmoved. The opening was high, but there were many sellers, so it turned low. From 520 taels, it was suppressed to within 15 taels. Because the exchange rate also fell, the sellers stopped. Then the overdrafts, etc. sold out, and then rose by two or three taels.

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Sales Were Booming</h3>
<p>Guangdong Gang Purchased More Than 8,000 Packages... Period Yarn Brought Up By One Taels - The Yarn Market, Which Had Been Stagnant for a Long Time, Suddenly Became Bright, and the Situation Was Quite Positive, Because the Guangdong Gang's Existing Yarn Had a Large Demand for Procurement, Which Was Very Active. It Was Found That About 10,000 Packages Or More Had Been Purchased in Two Days, and Most of the Packages Were 10-Count Yarn, so People's Hearts Were Greatly Shaken. Retailers Saw That the Situation Was Turning for the Better, and Activities Began to Pick Up and the Surge in Wind Rose Sharply. If the Actual Sales Can Continue Uninterrupted, the Future Can Certainly Be Seen. However, the 20-Count Five Fortune and Shepherd Yarn Has Not Been Moved Yet. This Product Has a Deeper Relationship with Standard Yarn, But Buyers Have This Help, and Their Attitude Is More Firm, so It Is Difficult to Tend to Be Lower for the Time Being.</p>
<p>Buyers Suddenly Rose in Speculation. In the Early Market of Period Yarn, the Situation Was Still Flat. Then, Because the Guangdong Gang Was Quite Forceful in Searching for Existing Yarn in the Market, People's Hearts Suddenly Tightened, and the Buying Sentiment Was Strong. Prices Rose in Each Round, with Each Month Rising by 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 Qians. In the Afternoon, It Was Heard That Actual Sales Were Smooth, and the Buying Wind in the Market Was Even More Fierce.

<h3>The Cotton Market Gradually Improved</h3>

Although Japanese Merchants Were Still Delivering Goods in Large Quantities, It Was Still Difficult for the Market to Fall Sharply. However, Each Factory Relied on the Abundance of Indian Cotton Inventory, and Was Inevitably Indifferent to Raw Cotton. Moreover, a Certain Manufacturer Was Dumping Hard. According to the Flat Trend of American Cotton, the Highest Han Standard Was 6 Taels and the Lowest Was 4 Taels and 5 Qians. There Should Be a Rotation Within This One Taels and Five Qians.</p>
<p>Han Standard Soared by Two or Three Qians. In the Period Yarn Exchange, the Han Standard Opened in the Early Market, and the Market's Atmosphere Was Flat. The Market Situation Tightened Suddenly Because the American Cotton's Rise and Fall Were Mixed. The Yarn Market Tended to Rise, and People's Hearts Were Lifted Up.

<h3>Japanese Operating Korean Textile Industry</h3>
<p>During the European War, the Japanese Economic Development to China Led to the Establishment of Japanese Yarn Factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Other Places. However, Korea Was Its Territory. Due to Political Relations, the Textile Industry Only Had the Korea Spinning Company Established in Busan. Other Places Were Still Vacant. Recently, the Korea Spinning Company Has a Plan to Increase 20,000 Spindles and 500 Weaving Machines. Other Companies Such as Toyo Cotton Company, Toyo Spinning Company, and Joint Spinning Company Are Also Looking for Sites in Mokpo and Other Places to Set Up Factories. Therefore, Japanese Spinning Entrepreneurs Are Gradually Developing Towards Korea. Considering the Reasons, (1) the Wages of Workers Are Low, (2) the Needs of Korea Are Very Large, and It Has a Considerable Market, (3) There Is a System of Levying Taxes on Imported Fabrics, etc. Moreover, Just From the Perspective of Raw Materials, the Annual Output of Raw Cotton South of Pyongyang Is About 70,000 Dan, and There Should Be Sufficient Potential for Development. It Is Quite Suitable for the Development of the Textile Industry. Once the Korean Spinning Industry Achieves Good Results, When the Cotton Industry in Japan Is in Poor Condition, or When Overseas Exports Are Difficult, It Can Be Adjusted and Alleviated.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Sales in the United States Led to a Sharp Rise in Silk Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Bank Silk Market in This Port Suddenly Rose Sharply. The Reason Was That the New York Market Had Recently Increased Due to the Increase in Exchange Rates.

Yesterday, Qianli and Other Companies Entered 70 Packages of May-June Shanghai White Factory Silk, and the Price Rose by 30 to 40 Taels.</p>
<h3>The Hangzhou Silk Cocoon Bank Is Preparing to Stop Weighing</h3>
<p>The Silk Cocoon Banks in Linping, Liangzhu, Nanshan, Pingyao, Lianbatang, and Other Places in Hangzhou Have Been Open for More Than Two Weeks. This Year's New Silk Cocoons Are Abundant, and the Goods Arriving in the Market Are Particularly Prosperous. The Number of Purchases by Each Bank Is About 2,000 to 3,000 Dan. The Purchase Appetite Is About to Be Satisfied. In the Last Two Days, There Has Been Continuous Rainy Weather, and the Goods Arriving Are Gradually Scarce. The Silk Cocoon Bank Is Preparing to Stop Weighing. This Year's Silk Cocoon Bank Price Must Be at 65 to 66 Yuan.</p>
<h3>Qihong Tea Market Was Extremely Prosperous for a While</h3>

<h3>The Wuyuan Tea Market Is Becoming More and More Deserted</h3>
<p>The New Tea in Wuyi, Since Each Number Discussed and Opened the Market, Qinghua and Other Places Sold for 80 Yuan. The Tea in Each Village Household in the North Township Is Firmly Priced According to This Market Price, With No Increase or Decrease. The Two Sides Stood Their Ground. Until Now, the Tea Number Has Only Entered a Little More Than One Hundred Dan to Dozens of Dan, and the Attitude Is Very Negative. The Reason Is That the Mountain Households Expect Too Much, and They Have Been Searching and Handling Southwest Two Townships. The Reason Is That the Gan River Is Currently Causing Commotion, and Transportation Is Obstructed. The Wuzhuang of a Certain Tea Warehouse in Siko Was Robbed the Other Night (140), and the Supply of Existing Foreign Currency in the Market Is Insufficient. Moreover, Many Are Afraid to Go to Tunxi to Handle Transportation. In Addition, the Price of Rice Is Soaring, and the Grain Reserves in the City and Countryside Are Exhausted. The Tea Number, Based on This Environment, Is Generally Cautious. There Are A Few Who Intend to End This Market. For These Reasons, the Tea Market in the Northeast Townships Has Become More and More Deserted in Recent Days.</p>
<h3>Xiushui Tea Price Rose After Falling</h3>
<p>Xiushui (That Is, Ningzhou) Is a Major Tea-Producing Area in Jiangxi Province. Every Year, It Produces and Sells No Less Than 50,000 to 60,000 Cases of Foreign Bank Red Tea. This Year, Xiushui Local Tea Numbers and Wuyuan, Yingkou, and Guangdong Eastern Banks Yiyuan and Other Numbers Have All Entered the Mountains to Open Businesses. The Bustling Is Not Reduced From Previous Years. Although the Tea Bank Tightened the Exchange, Most of the Tea Numbers Lent Directly With the Money Bank. The Silver Funds Do Not Need to Worry About Being Exhausted. The First-Character New Tea Opened the Market, and the Selling Price Was 400 Wen Per Catty, Which Was Reduced by 200 Wen Compared to the Old See. Later, Because the Weather Was Sunny, the Tea Production Was Quite Excellent, and Each Number Needed to Turn Eagerly. The Market Price Per Catty Was Raised to 600 Wen. The Unified Market Price Was Lower Than Last Year. Currently, Each Number's New Tea Has Been齐除, and Apart From the First-Character Box Tea Being Shipped, the Second-Character Has Also Been Piled Up. If the Weather Is Good, the Zicha Will Produce New, and the Numbers Are Quite Hungry.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market, due to the weather improving and sunshine spreading, the sentiment for future periods showed signs of softening. As for this year's wheat harvest, based on field surveys, a bumper harvest is expected. If continuous sunny weather can be obtained during the harvest period, the arrival of goods from various regions will inevitably surge, which is the basis for the pessimistic sentiment. Therefore, the prices for June and July generally decreased by a little over 7.5 li, while those for August and September decreased by a little over 1 fen. However, in the afternoon opening, due to the weather returning to overcast and the climate not warming, and foreign wheat quotations having rebounded by 6, 7, and 9 jiao respectively, most inland merchants remained cautious, and sellers held back, causing the asking prices for various months to gradually tighten. Observing this kind of fluctuating state, it will only be resolved after the new wheat is harvested. As a result, prices for May and July were slightly better than the previous day by 2.5 li, those for June and September each decreased slightly by 5 li, those for August and October remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wheat Bulls Already Exiting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sentiment in the futures wheat market was very weak, and inland bulls were also selling off their positions. Therefore, the lowest price for June reached 4 liang, 5 qian, and 1 fen, that for July was 4 liang and 4 qian, and that for August was 4 liang, 4 qian, and 3 fen, a decrease of 3 to 4 fen compared to the previous day. Prices for September and October also decreased by 1 to 2 fen. However, in the afternoon opening, foreign merchants buying to cover short positions caused a slight rebound. Observing this situation, if the wheat harvest is indeed good, the future outlook is still bearish. As a result, the price for June was slightly down by 2 fen from the previous day, those for July and September were each down by 1 fen, that for August remained unchanged, and that for October was up by 1 fen. Spot wheat prices showed softness for standard grades, and with new goods continuously arriving, customer sentiment was slightly weak, with asking prices decreasing by 2 fen from the previous day. Prices for Qingjiangpu wheat, Nansuizhou wheat, and Bengbu wheat were quoted at 5 liang and 1 qian and 5 fen, with a total of 4,000 bags offered, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Initially Falls, Then Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new shipments of foreign rice continued to arrive. Merchants from Jiangbei had slowed down their purchases, with sales limited to the Yangtze River area, Zhejiang Province, and inland regions. Sentiment was very soft, and prices initially decreased by a small jiao. Later, customer purchases became more concentrated, transactions increased, and prices rebounded by 5 fen. As a result, prices were down by 5 to 6 fen compared to the previous market. Transactions were mainly in small lots, with prices ranging from 14 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen to 3 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 8,000 bags. Additionally, there were 2,000 bags of brown rice, with prices ranging from 13 yuan, 6 jiao, and 8 fen to 5 jiao and 5 fen; 1,000 bags in large lots, with prices ranging from 14 yuan, 4 jiao to 3 jiao and 2 fen; 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, with prices at 15 yuan and 3 jiao; 1,500 bags of Min Dang rice, with prices ranging from 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen to 4 jiao and 5 fen; and 500 bags of Annam glutinous rice, with prices at 16 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen, it was said.</p>

Yang Gui Concubine pattern was offered at 1 qian and 8.5 fen, Qiba medium pattern at 1 qian and 7.5 fen, and Jilong pattern at 1 qian, 7 fen, and 7.5 li.

Western goods white striped Chong linen yarn showed slight strength yesterday. Xinyi brand goods were offered at 1 qian and 8.5 fen, and Taihe brand goods at 1 qian and 9 fen.

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Xinyou Theater Troupe declares that the audience was extremely satisfied with the troupe's seventh performance held at the Central Auditorium on the 10th and 11th of this month. However, at that time, it coincided with the strike of trams and buses in the Public Concession, and those who lived far away were inevitably disappointed. Now, it has been decided to restage "Uncle Wen" twice at the auditorium on the 31st.

<h3>After Watching The Merchant of Venice · Mo · Ruo · Qiang</h3>
<p>The Drama Association's The Merchant of Venice has been widely publicized in Shanghai for a long time. It was only recently performed at the Central Auditorium. I drove to watch it last Sunday, and the guests were crowded and there was no space. The popularity of the play can be seen from this. Before the play opened, what lingered in my mind was that performing a foreign play on the Chinese stage would inevitably lose the spirit of the original play, or it would become the New Camellia that was popular in the past, a strange play that was neither Chinese nor Western, neither donkey nor horse. However, in view of the Drama Association's previous successful performances and the cost of preparing for this play, I thought that this performance would not be without excellence for people to appreciate. However, with the bizarre plot and profound meaning of Shakespeare's original, I couldn't help but worry, and I didn't know if the gentlemen of the Drama Association had the courage to bring out the spirit of the original. Therefore, the doubts were unresolved, and the desire to see the play open was as urgent as a spark. Suddenly, all the electric lights in the hall went out, and the curtain slowly opened. What I saw was the Italian scenery of the 16th century. The actors' every move, every frown and smile, almost all matched the situation at that time. Compared with the images I had vaguely imagined in my mind when reciting Shakespeare's plays at school, I felt more intimate. Even those who have not read Shakespeare's original or are unfamiliar with the Italian situation, I think it is not difficult to evoke a special kind of joy from watching this.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole play, the performance is delicate, the background is realistic, and everything is lifelike, surpassing others. While watching, I couldn't help but be fascinated. After watching, I still felt the aftertaste.</p>
<p>The play was translated by Mr. Gu Zhongyi and directed by Mr. Ying Yunwei. The words and sentences are not much different from the original. The dialogue in the play is especially fluent and smooth, without any dragging. As for the arrangement of the actors, it can be said that the right person was chosen. Among them, Mr. Shen Tong, who played Shylock, was a particularly outstanding talent. His diction and expression were very much like a sinister and evil Jew. In the court trial scene, his fierce and brutal state was overflowing in his words. As for the words "I want to cut off a pound of his flesh, it was bought at a heavy price, it is mine, I want it, if you don't admit it, your laws are nonsense," the audience gnashed their teeth. Afterwards, when the lawsuit failed and the property was confiscated, everyone was very happy and relieved. As for Mr. Chen Xianmo, who played Bassanio, his behavior was very much like a handsome young man. In the second scene of the third act, when he expressed his love to Portia, he felt more thoughtful and appropriate. As for Mr. Wu Zhen, who played the Prince of Aragon, and Mr. Wang Jianhou, who played Gratiano, their expressions and dialogues all had unique points. Among the female roles, Ms. Yu Xiuyun, who played Portia, had delicate expressions, just like a beautiful and delicate girl. As for Ms. Su Wanjun, who played Jessica, her diction was clear and her voice was like an oriole, adding a lot of color to the whole play. The scenery was purely in the Italian style of the sixteenth century, even the details of a table and a stool, were lifelike. Art lighting was also used during the performance, which was bright and dazzling, creating a new perspective for the stage. Finally, the scene of Portia's home was especially wonderful, and I felt as if I was in the scene, and I couldn't believe that I was in the theater. It can be said to be divine. Touched by my feelings, I have described its characteristics for those who have not seen it.</p>

<h3>Beethoven, a Love Maniac</h3>
<p>Even when Beethoven's ears were gradually becoming diseased, he still passionately loved a count's daughter.</p>
<p>"Beautiful angel, our supreme and most precious life, our everything!"</p>
<p>His words to this young woman contained such passionate words. He sent to her a work that was full of burning love, which was the very famous "Adelaide". When composing this piece, in order to fully reveal his burning passion, he would often stab his chest.</p>
<p>When the ink on the score was not yet dry, a friend named Bort came to see him. He suddenly handed the score to Bort and said to him, please look at it, it's done, but it's not to my liking. The stove is indeed indispensable, I'm going to burn it.</p>
<p>Bort looked at the piece and sang it at the same time, and indeed felt it was very passionate, and his chest suddenly tensed and entered a terrifying state of excitement.</p>
<p>Thus, Adelaide escaped the fate of being burned as coal.</p>
<p>However, even taking this famous piece could not make the count's daughter think of herself as this old and deaf lover.</p>
<p>The girl finally just became the wife of a very ordinary man.</p>
<p>Beethoven also fell in love with the beautiful Marie Bicknell, and at that time Mrs. Bomerdena was also completely moved by love. Mrs. Bomerdena had been in love with Goethe, so she was a very famous woman.</p>
<h3>Two Poets of Homosexual Love</h3>
<p>The first time the talented French Parnassian poet Rapallo and Verlaine met was when he was sixteen years old. But he had already sent several poems to Verlaine when he was fifteen years old, asking him for criticism. At that time, Verlaine was amazed by his skill and subtle feeling, which could be slightly expressed in the depths of the poems. These works also shone brilliantly in his works of later years.</p>
<p>Rapallo was an extremely beautiful and handsome young man, so when Verlaine saw him, he was not only amazed by his talent, but also fell in love with his beauty.</p>
<p>At that time, Verlaine introduced many Parnassian poets to him, and Rapallo suddenly became a celebrity in the poetry world.</p>
<p>At the same time, Verlaine's body and soul were completely fascinated by Rapallo's beautiful face, and the two of them then fell into a deep homosexual love. Verlaine's head was only filled with Rapallo, and all his joys and sorrows were invested in Rapallo's beauty.</p>
<p>They went to Belgium together, to England, and casually to various places. In 1873, they stayed in Brussels, Belgium. One time, they drank overnight in a tavern, and as a result, they were both very drunk, and from a fierce quarrel, they came to a violent struggle.</p>
<p>At that time, Rapallo wanted to leave Verlaine, but Verlaine was unwilling. In Verlaine's eyes, to separate from Rapallo was like the arrival of all darkness. But Rapallo insisted on separating, and when he pushed Verlaine to the other side of the door, Verlaine lost his reason due to alcohol and fell into self-abandonment. Suddenly, he pointed his gun at Rapallo and fired twice. It was only then that Verlaine's mind began to clear, and he saw Rapallo had fallen to the ground, covered in red blood.</p>
<p>Rapallo was sent to the hospital, and at the same time Verlaine was arrested. As a result, Verlaine was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for attempted murder. He could only groan in prison for the next two years.</p>
<p>Verlaine wrote Songs Without Words in prison, and the correction of this collection of poems was done in prison. Rapallo's wounds also healed soon. After Verlaine was released from prison, they sometimes exchanged letters.</p>
<p>One night, on the bank of the Naga River on a moonlit night, they argued again due to alcohol abuse. Rapallo suddenly slapped Verlaine and ran away. Then they never met again. Rapallo's life, like Verlaine's, was also very unusual. After separating from Verlaine, he was never seen in Europe.</p>
<p>The Drunken Boat is his famous collection of poems. As if the sentences in the poems, he left European civilization and went to uncivilized Africa. Only one merchant said that he had seen Rapallo in the Balkans, but after that his news was lost.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Musicians - The Schumanns</h3>
<p>"Lovers always become family," this is a very meaningful sentence. The Schumanns were able to become husband and wife, also after various difficulties. First of all, Clara's father would not allow their union for any reason. Not only did he not allow it, but he also stood in a position of strong opposition, but they ultimately achieved a very satisfactory result because of the power of "love".</p>
<p>On September 12, 1840, Clara played Beethoven's short piece "Sultan" at a public meeting, resigned from the stage of her youth, and went to get married. The two of them held a wedding ceremony full of happiness, surrounded by blessings and love, in a church in Schinafeppold near Leipzig.</p>
<p>Before the marriage, Robert Schumann often praised Clara, saying, "When a poet makes a poem, he himself is not a poem, but Clara herself is a poem." Their marriage seemed to be blessed by all the artists, so it was completely happy.</p>
<p>Robert Schumann was a genius composer of modern Germany, and Clara was indeed a pianist with beauty and passion, and all the music she performed seemed to give the life of spring. They are really the best couple.</p>
<p>Musicians called 1840 Schumann's "Year of Song," and Schumann fell in love with Clara in that year. Therefore, the most compositions were published that year. After they got married, they often performed in major cities in Germany, as well as in the Netherlands, Russia, and Austria. During this period, perhaps because of excessive mental work in composing, Schumann's mental state suddenly deteriorated. In 1856, he died and left Clara.</p>
<p>Clara was a musician on the one hand, and on the other hand, she was also a model of a virtuous wife and loving mother. She passed away in 1896 and was buried with Schumann.</p>
<p>The Story of World Literature (1) (6) (0) Written by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<h3>Chapter 40: The Classical Age of German Literature</h3>
<p>This brief explanation of "Faust" does not even mention the original poem. It must be remembered that the whole play is much longer than "Paradise Lost," with each line possessing musical effervescence and vitality, meaning, and character depiction. There is no other work in the history of world literature long enough to compare with it. "Faust" is as important to us today as it was when the aging Goethe put down his pen.</p>
<p>It was Goethe who brought Schiller to Weimar and secured the position of Professor of History at the University of Jena for the young man who had struggled with worldly affairs. Schiller, ten years younger than Goethe, first rose to prominence with his prose dramas "The Robbers" and "Intrigue and Love," in which the new domestic bourgeois tragedy of the 19th century reached its peak. These plays were written in prose, possessing beautiful, sublime, revolutionary structure and powerful character portrayals, and laid the foundation for the modern art of tragic dialogue in prose. However, like Shelley's early poems, they had elements of wildness and lack of restraint. The writer, maturing in his knowledge of history and Kantian philosophy, devoted the remainder of his short life to the development of historical dramas and tragedies in verse. In Jena and Weimar, several plays were produced that constitute the most important system of dramatic works between Molière and Hebbel, namely "Don Carlos," "The Maid of Orleans," "Mary Stuart," "William Tell," and the "Wallenstein" trilogy. In recent years, although Schiller's plays are still popular on stage, they have somewhat declined in reputation. Naturalists tend to favor the early prose dramas, and severe criticism of Schiller's rhetoric and sentimentality, which is often found and particularly evident in "The Maid of Orleans," has become commonplace. Nevertheless, the most beautiful of the plays, "William Tell," and the entirety of "Wallenstein" – which is equally appropriate as a philosophical poem – remain vibrant and dramatically alive.</p>
<p>With Schiller's death, the strictly classical period of German literature can be said to have come to an end. Goethe lived until 1832, but by that time, the Romantic movement had long been completed, the July Revolution had ended, Heine had fled to Italy, and the new era was almost at midday.</p>
