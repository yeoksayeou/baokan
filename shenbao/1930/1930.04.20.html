<p>（上略）今天打算報告的、就是預備起草親屬繼承兩編的情形、比較上是更不易報告的、因爲親屬繼承中最大的問題、就是家族夫妻父子等問題、關係社會生存人民生活、極重且切、而且對這問題、各人觀念不同、見解也無從統一、於此兄弟有點聲明、第一、就是今天所報告的意見、並非經民法起草委員會討論的結果、第二、民法起草委員會對於這兩編毫無絶對的成見、實在講起來、我們覺得親屬繼承兩編的起草、比以前的三編尤加困難、起草前三編的時候、不過是立法技術的問題、原則上各國差不多都是一樣、雖物權編因各國情形而稍有異同、但比較上尙算容易、至於親屬繼承兩編、各國之間、很少完全相同、因爲每一個國家的親屬繼承法、都是根據本國社會上歷史上及經濟上的狀况定出來的、非别一國家所能仿傚、我們中國的狀况、現在隨時隨地都有變遷、究竟應當根據那一種的狀况來做標準呢、這是很困難的問題、因爲親屬法繼承法上的原則、大都根據社會上道德的觀念來的、而社會上道德的觀念、又因時代的不同、環境的不同、而有變易、所以很難定出一個標準出來、兄弟今天祇略略提出幾個問題來報告一下、在每個問題内、差不多全有不易解决的地方、第一、是家族的問題、中國對於家屬的問題、向來是採取宗祧主義的、將來還是維持這個主義哩、還是推翻這個主義呢、這是很難决定的、對於這一點、仁者見仁、智者見智、尙未有一致的主張、在主張推翻的一方面說、這種主義是封建的思想、是違背本黨男女平等的原則、並且可以養成個人依賴的習慣、在主張維持一方面說、這種主義是我們中華民族很大的優點、中國人向來是一盤散沙、全仗這種主義來維繫着、我們要發揮家族觀念、以逹到於民族觀念的、我國僑民在外國做事、却常常的想回到祖國來、未嘗不是由家族觀念所發生、並且在事實上廢止宗祧一事、暫時能否做得到、還是一個問題、又有人問廢了宗祧之後、究竟是女隨男姓呢、還是男隨女姓呢、或是另外找一個姓呢、也是很繁難的、這麽看起來、主張保存的和主張廢止的似乎都有理由、這是起草這兩編時第一點困難、第二、是婚姻問題、本來以科學的眼光看來、世界上有三個問題不能解决、一是生、二是死、三是婚姻、單就婚姻問題來講、都說婚姻根據愛情、男女之間如何而後發生愛情、這是科學家没有方法解决的、現在要我們來解决這婚姻問題、豈不是很困難的件事嗎、在從前的立法家對於這種問題的立法、大都很武斷的、不過在最近幾十年來立法家漸次採取科學的方法、不取武斷的方法了、所以我們一方面根據社會情形、一方面要從科學上來研究、纔能定一個最適當的方法、不過這個問題從社會方面研究他、本來就很不容易、再要從科學方面來研究、那就更不容易了、從社會方面說、怎麽困難呢、因爲世界上人類大槪都有一個很大的弱點、凡不是我所喜歡的、就硬說他没有、對於許多不道德的事情、似乎都不肯承認其會發生會存在、但事實上不管我們歡喜不歡喜、發生仍然發生、存在仍然存在、現在要研究婚姻問題、我們就不好自已騙自已了、先要問婚姻這件事、根本的觀念究竟是怎麽樣、據兄弟觀察、現世對於婚姻的觀念、大槪可分爲三種、（一）認爲結婚是專爲性慾的、（二）結婚是爲公共生活的、（三）結婚是爲傳宗接代的、世界各國的立法、都離不開這三種、第一種的結婚、歐美各國中以美國爲最厲害、這是因爲受了宗敎上的影響、聖保羅所謂結婚可防止奸淫、就是這個意思、旣以情慾爲目的而結婚、如一旦違背了這個條件、當然就是離婚的唯一原因、所以美國人於結婚後發生隔膜而離婚的很多、就我所得的詳細統計、祇一九二三年這一年中、結婚的有一百二十幾萬人、而離婚的有十六萬多、平均算起來、大槪一百個人結婚、總有十三個人離婚、最近幾年、在一百個結婚的人當中、總有三十個離婚的、離婚的人這樣多、因之便演成什麽結果呢、在一九二三年以前、美國每年有八萬個十歲以下因此無家可歸的孩子、到現在總該有十萬以上了、並且據他們刑事調查的結果、一百個兒童犯裹有八十個是這些無家可歸的兒童、現在美國政府覺得這個問題非常緊要、正在想法解决、但是還没有適當的辦法、這是根據第一個觀念專以情慾而結婚的結果、第二種結婚、是把情慾和婚姻分開的、這種制度、法國最通行、他的根本觀念、旣和美國不同、所以離婚的事情也就比較的少了、但是因爲把情慾和結婚太過分開、結果也有不好的現像、就發生了人種减少的大問題、這是根據第二個觀念、以家庭爲結婚條件的結果、第三種以傳宗接代爲結婚目的的、就是中國人、離婚的事情、比較各國都少、不過男女平等的原則、可就不能維持、女人就多半不大自由了、拿這三個觀念來說、究竟我們應該採取那個呢、這不是最困難的問題嗎、現在美國雖然主張仍舊維持他的頭一個觀念、法國雖也主張仍舊維持他的第二個觀念、可是都已想法避免那不好的結果、以這兩種觀爲目的、都有相當的理由、同時也都有相當的缺點、我們究竟應該採取那個辦法、實在難以决定、（未完）</p>

<p>▲未刦之前　泗安當股匪竄擾之前、附近綁刦之案、已日有所聞、因鎭中警備甚形單薄、且匪徒散居、進勦不易、祇得任其横行鄕里而已、月前鎭中謠言頗甚、謂有廣德大刀會千餘人、已抵該處山叢、一時人心惶惶、不可終日、後復有曾充鈕店橋保衛團敎練之王某在該處唆使羽黨、廣招門徒、宵小之輩附者甚衆、時駐防軍警亦微有所聞、故鎭中即無形戒嚴矣、及至小溪口胥倉橋下源渡等處保衛團槍械被匪繳去後、鎭中形勎危急萬分、一夕數驚、入夜即槍聲時斷時續、終宵不絶、以致富有者遷徒他處、燈花初上、街中已冷落無人矣、</p>

<p>▲貪圖獲得較佳職業</p>
<p>▲不惜以弱妹供犠牲</p>
<p>▲陳金生詐騙汚少女</p>
<p>▲如此敗類亟應嚴辦</p>
<p>▲閨女風姿綽約　南京人徐金松、寓西門唐家灣瑞昌里十九號、其家屬則住蘇州葑門外、徐在襪廠作工、其妹徐桂寳、二九年華、風姿綽約、待字閨中、殊乏生活之路、</p>
<p>▲來滬爲女招待　本年三月、桂寳以在家無事、來滬謀生、以赴工廠工作、必須經過學習、又須化費、故由其姊介紹到新新公司屋頂花園爲女招待、惟爲女招待每日須泡荼廿碗、方可交賬、乃桂寳不善應酬、每日僅售七八碗之數、以致工作六七日、即被停歇、</p>
<p>▲結識了陳金生　但此六七日之功夫、在新新公司中竟識一陳金生者、每日必到其處泡荼、漸相攀談、陳謂渠係在京滬鐵路龍頭上爲老管、頗有權衡、桂寳思其長兄徐金山現在無事、而二兄徐金松、行業亦不賺錢、即託陳尋生意、乃陳一力担承、遂問明桂寳住址而訂約後、</p>
<p>▲一家趨奉貴客　桂寳被新新公司停歇後、陳金生曾到瑞昌里徐家訪候、是以其家中咸認陳金生爲貴客、莫不趨奉、陳允予代薦生意、旋候之數日、未見動靜、桂寳之長兄、已不耐而歸蘇、桂寳亦擬動身、乃陳金生忽於斯時蒞止、</p>
<p>▲生意謂已覓得　言已爲徐金山薦爲火車荼房、徐金松則在龍頭上加油、均已成功、徐金松大喜、惟以長兄已歸、徒呼負負、乃同居之馬姓·丁正康·丁文爲·等均託陳金生一力玉成、代爲介紹荼房、徐金山之缺、由馬姓墊擋、陳亦一口允許</p>
<p>▲桂寳竟被汚辱　遂謂衆人云、每人須出洋五元交在賬房、以謂買熱水玻璃杯之用、較自已購備爲便當、而不致多碎、徐等深信不疑、奉爲祖宗一般、並反使桂寳不必避嫌、奉承貴人、以致陳金生將桂寳得明目張膽之帶出共游、並在鐵路旅館迭次姦汚、不以爲恥、反以爲榮、生活環境之魔力大矣哉、</p>
<p>▲北站引見總管　徐金松又以好生意已成就、故將襪廠之生意亦自動辭歇、而桂寳亦再三求陳金生爲其兄早爲引進、如是數日後、陳乃令各製靑布衣服一套、徐金松則應着中山裝、穿後帶同徐等一干人到北站三樓見總管、徐等見門上書有非公莫入四字、足見是眞、愈爲信任、詎上樓後、陳略一視、即云西崽不在、無人翻譯、改日再見罷、徐等亦欣然歸家、</p>
<p>▲前後四十餘元　而陳仍與桂寳留連、用度亦頗闊綽、約三日後、陳又向徐等謂每人再須五元、以爲入工會之費、徐等無奈、遂典質付之、實則其關旅館之費用無出、故揑名騙取、前後共被騙去四十餘元、又賠一弱妹、以供淫汚、生意究竟如何、尙未受其實惠、</p>
<p>▲恍如大夢初醒　前日、徐與馬姓同到車站、找尋陳金生、乃馬姓有一友人、係爲路警、見馬即詢問、馬將始末告之、該警大疑、遂偕同往尋、見陳後、始知並非車站中之人、係屬假冒者、遂問其汝幹何事的、陳答係來白相、該警遂賞以巨靈之掌、而捕至警務處、徐金松至是如同夢醒、以錢被驅、妹被汚、自已襪廠生意又歇、實有求死不得、求生汪能之槪、故亦投警務處請究、該處當又傳到徐桂寳到處訊明、連被誘姦、大爲震怒　於昨日一併解送地方法院研訊一過、諭被告陳金生收押候究、</p>

<p>▲正兇在泗涇成擒</p>
<p>▲兩帮兇在逃未獲</p>
<p>居住外虹口香烟橋路七十二號弄十三號門牌開設中央印刷所兼營糞業之阜寗人王葆山、於本年二月二十八日夜晚九時、忽被仇人開槍暗殺身死、詳情已誌本報、當時雖經該管五區三分所拘獲嫌疑犯及兇手等之　　多名、而正兇始終在、逃未獲、茲悉　案正犯、爲鹽城人王藕廣、已於前日被市公安局偵緝隊在泗涇將王緝獲、茲將偵獲詳情、縷誌於次、</p>
<p>▲偵查正兇　是案發生於本年二月二十八日、當時即由該管五區三分所拘獲兇手戴如藻之妻戴鄧氏、弟戴如能、王福廣之妻王朱氏、王弟王文湘、並嫌疑犯施福林、及施妻王氏、見證施宗林等數人、曾經申解司法科、轉送地方法院訊辦在案、但各人口供異常支吾、究莫知正兇誰屬、</p>
<p>▲因妒生仇　公安局長袁良、對於是案異常重視、旋於上月十四日特頒發法字第一七五號訓令、通飭所屬、一體嚴緝正兇、務獲解究、偵緝隊盧代隊長奉令後、即隨時密令所屬各班探員、限日破獲、經偵緝員詳查、結果、方悉是案正兇、即係在逃之王福廣、蓋因福廣亦營糞業、於是因妒業發生仇視、遂動殺機、</p>
<p>▲拘獲嫌疑　盧隊長旣偵明王福廣爲案中正犯、遂下令注意嚴緝、而該犯亦早已畏罪遠遁、影踪俱無、直至本月十二夜晚十時、忽據偵緝員陳吉人報稱、謂拘獲是案嫌疑王萬高一名、當即帶隊研訊、旋據王供、年十五歲、向在其兄王萬奎家挑糞、本年舊曆三月初頭入晚八時許、忽有素識之王福廣與戴如藻二人、逕至我兄萬奎家、密告當時行剌王葆山情形、</p>
<p>▲三爺倖免　福廣與戴兩人晤見我兄萬奎後、三人即秘密談話、我（萬高自稱）因與萬奎係手足、彼等故不置疑、旋聞福廣云、彼等行剌先生、（即指葆山）共去八人、四人在外把風、四人入内動手、事成後、又到三爺（即王庭章）家、剌殺三爺、適三爺外出、故未遇害、其餘所談聲音漸低、含糊莫辨、最後又聽福廣云、彼現在已遷居吳淞南莊子十四號新平房内、當時我兄萬奎亦未置答、直至深夜一時、福廣與戴兩人、方始辭去云云、</p>
<p>▲洩露眞情　萬高又供、當時彼等辭出後、萬奎囑我不得洩漏、否則即欲將我置於死地、直至昨日（十二日）、我由外返家、王庭章即向我詢問、我即以實相告、不敢朦諱云云、盧隊長據供、立飭領班齊海田、率同偵緝員陳吉人徐榮福等、帶同王萬高、馳往楊樹浦高榔橋東北草棚内、將萬奎拘獲、訊據供年四十二歲、鹽城籍、謂此案詳情、須將王佩山拘到、即可明暸云云、</p>
<p>▲逃避泗涇　盧隊長復飭原辦探員、帶同萬奎、至虹口香烟橋物華絲織廠附近草棚内、將王佩山拘到、據供年五十九歲、鹽城人、賣菜爲業、又謂是案内情、須問凌三林云云、遂又至閘北香烟橋與死者隔隣十二號内、將凌帶案、凌供年三十四歲、賣菜爲業、亦鹽城人、謂正兇王福廣現已逃往泗涇、可以領捉等語、復由原班探員逕往泗涇、將福廣拿獲、帶隊嚴訊</p>
<p>▲殺機由來　正兇王福廣、供年三十九歲、鹽城人、住居閘北香烟橋七二號弄十二號門牌、挑糞爲業、因死者向來開有老糞行、我擬另設新行、致與死者結成仇怨、當即與夥友戴如藻磋商、戴遂起意將死者暗殺、即於二月二十八日入晚九時許、邀同劉大罐子·朱子香·施福林等五人、共帶手槍三支、逕至死者家中、適死者正端坐圓桌旁、劉大罐子首先闖入、拔槍向死者狙擊、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Case of Recovering Weihaiwei <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Formal Signing of the Special Treaty Agreed Upon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Weihaiwei Special Treaty and Agreement were formally signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs residence on the evening of the 18th. It is reported that the main text has more than twenty articles, with six additional notes exchanged between the plenipotentiary representatives of both parties. According to sources, the content of the agreement is approximately as follows: (1) Liugong Island is permitted to be used by British naval vessels for summer anchorage, but only within the harbor area of ten nautical miles (approximately thirty Chinese li). (2) Britain may retain buildings on Liugong Island within the agreed area. (3) Private land properties of the British in Weihaiwei will be returned upon expiration of the lease. (4) Buildings on land in Weihaiwei will be retained; land and property turned over to China, except for the retained portions, will be repurchased by China at a compensation price. (5) Official land in Weihaiwei, leased by Britain to foreigners, will temporarily continue to be fulfilled under the original terms. It is reported that after the British envoy signed on the evening of the 18th, he telegraphed the government and sent the full text to London for approval. The Chinese side will also submit it to the National Government for approval through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it will take effect immediately. The announcement period of the agreement is expected to be around three weeks. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Envoy Lampson reportedly boarded a ship for Shanghai at 10:00 a.m. on the 19th. Matters concerning Sino-British legal rights and the return of the Boxer Indemnity will continue to be discussed in Shanghai with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Special Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The recovery of Weihaiwei is divided into two parts: one is the main treaty, namely the Weihaiwei Recovery Special Treaty, which includes a list of state properties in Weihaiwei city to be transferred by the British government; the other is an agreement, namely the British extended lease of Liugong Island, the nature of which is similar to a contract. The special treaty has approximately eight articles, of which the most important are three points: (1) The administrative jurisdiction over the two parts of the water surface within Weihaiwei Bay, as well as the islands in the bay, and the leased area along the coast within ten English miles, is completely relinquished by Britain and will be directly administered by our country. (2) All national buildings owned by the British side in Weihaiwei city and harbor, as well as British warships in the harbor, will be returned to our country completely free of charge. A separate list of buildings and warships is provided, with an estimated value of approximately two million yuan. Private property within the area cannot be handed over due to the state's lack of authority under national law. In the future, if British people voluntarily auction, they should still be handled according to legal procedures. (3) Liugong Island within Weihaiwei Bay is leased to Britain for ten years, stipulating that the British Navy may go there for summer anchorage during the summer period. However, there are two points that differ from previous discussions. First, it is limited to the summer months of April, May, and June that British warships are allowed to go for anchorage, and it is not a long-term permission for British warships to enter freely. Second, the lease is definitely not as stipulated before, that after the ten-year lease expires, our side cannot recover it without justifiable reasons. Therefore, although an extended lease of ten years is stipulated this time, if our government has the right to convert the port into a military port at any time during this ten-year period, we can recover it immediately without being bound by the lease, and there is no so-called provision that the agreement cannot be terminated without justifiable reasons. It is reported that this point is explained in the main treaty, and the detailed methods are fully recorded in the agreement on the extended lease of Liugong Island. In addition, regarding litigation issues in Weihaiwei city, cases that have been adjudicated by the British side will not be pursued again. In the future, if litigation cases occur, they will be handled by our country's courts. The Chinese government should be responsible for protecting the private property of British residents in Weihaiwei city, and it is hoped that the Chinese government will adopt the British system in this area and continue to handle other trivial matters.

<h3 id="e8">World Disputes <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The disputes of the world lie in that those who have gained are unwilling to relinquish what they have lost, while those who have lost seek to regain what they lost. Further, those who have gained strive to gain even more, while those who have lost, after regaining what they lost, seek to gain even more. Therefore, regardless of whether what has been gained was rightfully theirs or not, and regardless of the means by which it was gained—whether through theft, robbery, or encroachment—they do not say, "This was not originally ours." Once someone demands its return, instead of being grateful for the undue gains they had previously made and sincerely returning them, they believe that because they had previously stolen, robbed, or encroached upon it, because they have gained it, it is rightfully theirs. They view the other party's demand for its return as unwarranted. This is the common psychology of those in power towards the weak, the greatest source of injustice, and the stubborn persist in upholding it with all their might. This is the root of the dispute.</p>
<p>The origin of gain and loss lies in strength and weakness, and the origin of strength and weakness lies in intelligence and force. In the unenlightened world, there are few intelligent people and many foolish people. As a result, the few intelligent people use their intelligence and force to exploit the foolish people. From this, the few intelligent people become strong, while the many foolish people become weak. After the world gradually became enlightened, the many foolish people gradually acquired knowledge essential to mankind, gradually learned to unite, gradually learned to resist, and gradually learned to reclaim their lost rights. The strength of the few intelligent people will eventually be unsustainable. However, the stubborn, unaware of the changing times, still want to stubbornly hold on to what they have. This is why disputes are ultimately unavoidable. The disputes between countries in the world today, as well as the disputes within countries, are mostly like this.</p>

<p>Chittagong Rioters Destroy Armory</p>
<p>Armed Police Highly Active</p>
<p>Leader of Bombay Resisters Arrested</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Calcutta, 19th: The government announced that last night in Chittagong, a hundred rioters attacked and burned the armories of the railway and police station. Details are unknown. It is reported that the rioters shot and killed one major, one British Indian, and four Indians. The railway clerk and his wife are safe. A further telegram stated that police and local auxiliary forces are currently making every effort to encircle and capture the rioters. Today, a detachment of troops was dispatched here to suppress them and is expected to reach its destination tomorrow morning. The police commissioner is also traveling with them. Telegraphic communications were initially cut off but have now been restored. Last night, a train derailed 40 miles from Chittagong due to obstructed tracks, but is now passable.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Calcutta: Since the storm began here today, the police have been highly active. Armored vehicles and armed police units have occupied key points. Armories are heavily guarded. Airplanes are flying reconnaissance missions. Today, 21 important figures from the National Congress Committee were arrested. This was the result of simultaneous searches, with particular emphasis on the headquarters of the National Congress Committee. Documents at the headquarters were confiscated.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Bombay, 18th: Today, Bombay is very peaceful, with no news of arrests. Therefore, today can be regarded as the most peaceful day since Gandhi launched the campaign to break the salt law. A subordinate of Gandhi said that this is still the calm before the storm. A telegram also stated that Mohta, a former important figure in the Bombay Council and now the leader of the Bombay non-violent resisters, has been arrested.

<p>▲ The Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 19th: Regarding the Tripartite Agreement on disarmament, it was submitted to the Cabinet meeting on the 18th. After a detailed explanation by Foreign Minister Shidehara, it was decided to send a final telegram to Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki, ordering him to formally sign on the 22nd. The contents of the instruction plan were drafted by Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Foreign Minister Shidehara. After the agreement is signed, Prime Minister Hamaguchi will issue a statement or a separate declaration to the country in the form of a speech, stating the government's position.</p>
<p>▲ The National News Agency, Washington, 18th: According to the interpretation of naval authorities, once the Three-Power Naval Agreement is concluded in London, the United States can immediately begin the construction of seven cruisers. The remaining three cruisers permitted by the agreement can be built successively in the three years of 1933, 1934, and 1935. As for the three battleships to be dismantled as stipulated in the agreement, one is already beyond repair in the 1931 annual budget, while the other countries' battleships to be eliminated are more modern, so they must wait until 1934 and 1935 before being dismantled. Senator Hale stated in the Senate that the Senate as a whole will temporarily not make a judgment on this agreement because it is in clear conflict with the US 8-inch gun cruiser policy. It is best to submit this agreement to the committee he chairs for review before the Senate makes a decision.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 18th: Various political parties are now preparing everything, intending to begin their struggle over naval policy after the US representatives return to America with the Tripartite Agreement. President Hoover hopes for a short-term battle, otherwise the naval program submitted to Congress will be delayed until January next year before a decision can be made. The pro-navy faction is now engaged in an active campaign against the reduction of naval armaments. However, President Hoover is confident that he can get the support of public opinion and will appeal to the nation via radio when the agreement is submitted to Congress. Senator Hale, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, does not approve of the agreement and today advised senators to stop acting until the Naval Committee has heard the opinions of experts. The government expects that the first seven of the 10,000-ton cruisers allowed to the United States can be built before 1933, and the remaining three ships will be built one each in the three years of 1933 to 1935.</p>

The Executive Chairman of the Joint Association has stated that regardless of whether the municipal railway employees' union and other friendly groups, which belong to the municipal railway labor faction, will act together, they will strike independently. The situation is gradually deteriorating.</p>

<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Sacramento, California, 18th - The idea of using robots to pilot airplanes has been discussed for a long time, but it has never been tested in practice. Today, two aviators took a military bomber to an altitude of 1,000 feet and handed the controls over to a robot. The robot successfully piloted the aircraft over San Francisco Bay to San Francisco, then flew along the coast of the Golden Gate area and returned to the point of takeoff, landing safely. According to army personnel, based on the success of this test, robots could be used to pilot aircraft when weather conditions are poor and human eyesight is inadequate. The construction of this method is largely the same as the method for marine robots, which has been used for several years. Their ability to distinguish routes is even more accurate than that of humans.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - A fire broke out naturally in the mountains near Onoe Village, Shimohei District, Iwate Prefecture, at 1:00 PM on the 18th. With a strong northwest wind blowing, the fire spread rapidly. Both the Onde and Arakawa settlements were surrounded by flames, causing panic. Although nearby villagers exerted every effort to fight the fire, they were unsuccessful, and it was difficult to extinguish. In addition, a forest fire started at noon on the 17th in the Shintayamaen forest in Hiei District, and spread to the Sano settlement at 4:00 PM. Due to the strong wind, the fire spread further. Although the youth groups and fire brigades of nearby villages worked hard to extinguish it, they were ineffective. The area burned has reached 800 chōbu. Furthermore, a mountain fire that started in the Ushigushi settlement of Hanawa Village completely burned down the entire village of Moichi due to the strong winds. The Ushigushi settlement is in danger. As of 4:30 PM, the area burned has reached 400 chōbu. In addition, a mountain fire that started in the mountains near Ikawa Village, Iwate Prefecture, had already burned down Takato Village by noon on the 17th. It spread to neighboring mountains, and the fire was still burning as of the afternoon of the 18th. The scene was extremely tragic as viewed from the train windows. Men from nearby villages were all out fighting the fire, while women were moving household goods and furniture. The area burned in each location is over 800 chōbu. If the drought continues for the next few days, with no rain and strong winds, it could lead to a major disaster, rare in recent Japanese history. Although the prefectural authorities are making every effort to take emergency measures, the future is deeply worrying.</p>

<p>Since the Treaty of Versailles was concluded and the League of Nations established, the first chapter of the Treaty of Versailles, which is the entire covenant of the League of Nations, shows that the representatives of the negotiating countries at that time spared no effort to find ways to eliminate the scourge of war and maintain peace. Unfortunately, the articles of the covenant were brief, and interpretations were often divergent. Although governments could request interpretations from the International Court of Justice in The Hague at any time, the power of restraint was difficult to impose on the world, and criticism often blamed the League for maintaining peace in name only, failing to devise practical measures. This was not without reason. Last September, at the General Assembly of the League of Nations, British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson and Chinese Dr. Wu Chao-chu each proposed amendments and interpretations to the articles of the covenant, leading to the establishment of a special committee to amend the covenant. This was also due to the recognition of the issue.</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference was primarily aimed at discussing the reduction and limitation of naval forces of the five major participating powers, but whether the naval forces of each country could be reduced and limited depended entirely on whether each country's own security concerns were resolved. Since the European War, there have been numerous international disarmament conferences, but the results have often been unsatisfactory. The point of contention lies here. For example, France's financial resources are far inferior to those of Britain and the United States, so it not only maintains vigilance against the naval power of Britain and the United States, but also harbors constant fear of its eastern neighbor Italy and a resurgent Germany. To maintain its existing position along its coast and in the Mediterranean, France has had to abandon the policy of large battleships and focus on building submarines as a means of defense. Therefore, at each disarmament conference, France insists on resolving the issue of security guarantees first. Given France's position and interests, its reasons are indeed not entirely unreasonable. At this London Naval Conference, the French representatives again strongly advocated for an interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations. According to a Reuters dispatch from London the other day, British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Foreign Minister Briand met to discuss the political issues of the Naval Conference, and as a result, an agreement has been reached on the interpretation of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which is related to French security. Since France has been fighting for security issues for years, and the League of Nations Covenant has been criticized for the security issues of member states, now that the Naval Conference has been able to satisfy France's wishes, France may agree with the participating powers on the policy of naval reduction. By extension, the Special Committee for the Amendment of the Covenant of the League of Nations can also use this as a basis for further discussion to achieve a satisfactory amendment of the Covenant. The result is not only related to the London Naval Conference. The original text of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations is recorded on the left for the reader's reference.</p>
<p>"Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not.</p>
<p>It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.</p>
<p>The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimize any loss or inconvenience resulting therefrom, and that they will mutually support one another in resisting any special measures aimed at one of their number by the covenant-breaking State, and that they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League.</p>
<p>Any Member of the League which has violated any covenant of the League may be declared to be no longer a Member of the League by a vote of the Council concurred in by the Representatives of all the other Members of the League represented thereon."</p>

<h3 id="e49">Fu Bingchang Lectures on Important Issues in the Relatives and Inheritance Sections of the Civil Code <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Code Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan is currently working on drafting the Relatives and Inheritance sections. However, these two sections are of utmost importance, and the points that should be resolved first have been submitted to the Central Political Council for resolution by Yuan President Hu Hanmin and Lin Sen. Hu also requested Committee Chairman Fu Bingchang to give a lecture during the Yuan's memorial week on the 14th to promote the attention of all members of the Yuan. The text of Fu's speech is excerpted below:</p>
<p>(Previous text omitted) What I intend to report on today is the situation in preparing to draft the Relatives and Inheritance sections, which is even more difficult to report on. Because the biggest issues in Relatives and Inheritance are issues such as family, husband and wife, and father and son, which are extremely important and relevant to the survival of society and the lives of the people. Moreover, people have different views on these issues, and there is no way to unify opinions. Here, I would like to make a few statements. First, the opinions reported today are not the result of discussions by the Civil Code Drafting Committee. Second, the Civil Code Drafting Committee has no absolute preconceived notions about these two sections. Frankly speaking, we feel that drafting the Relatives and Inheritance sections is even more difficult than the previous three sections. When drafting the previous three sections, it was just a matter of legislative technique. In principle, all countries are almost the same. Although the Property Rights section has some differences due to the circumstances of each country, it is still relatively easy. As for the Relatives and Inheritance sections, there are very few countries that are completely the same, because the Relatives and Inheritance Law of each country is based on the social, historical, and economic conditions of that country, and cannot be imitated by another country. The conditions in China are now changing all the time. Which condition should we use as the standard? This is a very difficult question. Because the principles of the Relatives Law and the Inheritance Law are mostly based on social and moral concepts, and social and moral concepts change with the times and with different environments, it is very difficult to set a standard. Today, I will only briefly raise a few issues for discussion. Within each issue, there are almost all irresolvable areas. First, is the issue of family. China has always adopted the clan system for the issue of family members. Will we maintain this system in the future, or will we overthrow this system? This is very difficult to decide. On this point, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, and there is no unanimous opinion. On the side that advocates overthrow, this system is feudalistic, violates the party's principle of equality between men and women, and can foster habits of personal dependence. On the side that advocates maintaining, this system is a great advantage of our Chinese nation. The Chinese have always been a disorganized force, and they rely on this system to maintain cohesion. We must promote the concept of family in order to achieve the concept of nation. Chinese emigrants working abroad often want to return to their homeland, which is not without reason due to the concept of family. Moreover, in fact, whether the abolition of the clan system can be achieved temporarily is still a question. Some people also ask whether, after the clan system is abolished, will the woman take the man's surname, or will the man take the woman's surname, or will another surname be found? It is also very complicated. From this perspective, it seems that both those who advocate preservation and those who advocate abolition have their reasons. This is the first difficulty in drafting these two sections. Second, is the issue of marriage. Originally, from a scientific perspective, there are three problems in the world that cannot be solved: one is birth, the second is death, and the third is marriage. Just talking about the issue of marriage, it is said that marriage is based on love. How does love arise between men and women? This is a problem that scientists have no way to solve. Now we are asked to solve this marriage problem, isn't it a very difficult thing? In the past, lawmakers were very arbitrary in legislating on this issue, but in recent decades, lawmakers have gradually adopted scientific methods and abandoned arbitrary methods. Therefore, we must study from both the social situation and from a scientific perspective in order to determine the most appropriate method. However, studying this issue from a social perspective is already very difficult, and studying it from a scientific perspective is even more difficult. What are the difficulties from a social perspective? Because most people in the world have a great weakness. Anything that I don't like, I insist on saying that it doesn't exist. For many immoral things, it seems that they are unwilling to admit that they will happen or exist. But in fact, whether we like it or not, it still happens and still exists. Now that we want to study the issue of marriage, we shouldn't deceive ourselves. First, we must ask what the fundamental concept of marriage is. According to my observation, there are probably three types of concepts of marriage in the world: (1) believing that marriage is solely for sexual desire; (2) believing that marriage is for public life; (3) believing that marriage is for procreation. The legislation of all countries in the world cannot be separated from these three types. The first type of marriage is most prevalent in the United States in Europe and America. This is because it is influenced by religion. Saint Paul said that marriage can prevent fornication, which is what it means. Since marriage is for the purpose of lust, if this condition is violated, it is naturally the only reason for divorce. Therefore, there are many cases of divorce in the United States after marriage due to estrangement. According to the detailed statistics I have obtained, in 1923 alone, there were more than 1.2 million marriages and more than 160,000 divorces. On average, roughly 13 out of 100 people who get married divorce. In recent years, roughly 30 out of 100 people who get married divorce. With so many divorces, what is the result? Before 1923, there were 80,000 children under the age of ten who were homeless every year in the United States as a result. Now there should be more than 100,000. According to their criminal investigations, 80 out of 100 juvenile offenders are these homeless children. Now the United States government feels that this issue is very important and is trying to find a solution, but there is no appropriate method. This is the result of the first concept of marriage, which is solely for lust. The second type of marriage is to separate lust and marriage. This system is most common in France. Its fundamental concept is different from that of the United States, so there are relatively fewer cases of divorce. However, because lust and marriage are separated too much, there are also bad phenomena, such as the major problem of population decline. This is the result of the second concept, which is to take family as a condition for marriage. The third type, which takes procreation as the purpose of marriage, is the Chinese. There are fewer cases of divorce compared to other countries, but the principle of equality between men and women cannot be maintained, and women are mostly not free. Which of these three concepts should we adopt? Isn't this the most difficult problem? Now, although the United States insists on maintaining its first concept, and France insists on maintaining its second concept, they are both trying to avoid the bad results. There are considerable reasons for taking these two concepts as the goal, and there are also considerable shortcomings at the same time. Which method should we adopt? It is really difficult to decide. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Development of the Longhai Railway <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>▲ Extension of Branch Line on the Eastern Section</p>
<p>▲ Addition of a Freight Depot at Xuzhou Station</p>
<p>Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Administration, recently formulated two plans to develop railway services. One plan involves constructing a branch line northward from Bayiji Station on the eastern section to Zaozhuang. The other plan involves building a freight depot at the East Xuzhou Station and constructing a connecting track. Surveys and cost estimates for both projects are complete. Qian departed from Xuzhou for Beijing today (the 17th) to seek approval from the Ministry of Railways for these plans. Bi La, the chief engineer of the railway, has also arrived in Xuzhou to assist Qian in carrying out these projects. However, problems persist with tenants leasing land from the Longhai Railway. The following is a record of the planned projects:</p>
<p>▲ Construction of Branch Line: Bayiji Station is a major station located south of Pi County on the eastern section of the railway, and northeast of Xuzhou. From this station, a branch line will be built northward, passing through Xin Pizhou to reach Taierzhuang on the bank of the Grand Canal, across from Zaozhuang. Zaozhuang is the location of the Zhongxing Coal Mine. The existing Lin-Zao branch line connects to Lincheng Station on the Jinpu Railway. However, the transportation of coal from this mine, which is usually done via the Jinpu Railway, is insufficient. The coal is of excellent quality and abundant. Qian plans to build a branch line from Bayiji to Lincheng, crossing the Grand Canal to connect with Zaozhuang. This line will transport coal via Dapu for export, balancing the transportation of Zhongxing coal and developing the commercial transportation of the Longhai Railway. Zhang Duchen, Chairman of the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company, who previously served as Superintendent of the Longhai Railway, strongly supports Qian's proposal. The two parties have had substantial discussions. The surveyed length of the entire line is approximately 31 kilometers, with an estimated construction cost of 1.1 million yuan. The route runs north-south between Bayiji and Zaozhuang.</p>
<p>▲ Construction of Freight Depot: The Xuzhou station of the Longhai Railway is located in the North Gate. Later, the East Gate became a key transportation hub, so land was purchased in the East Station for construction, but due to lack of funds, this construction has not happened. Now the station borrows from the Jinpu Railway depot and connecting track, and rents these out daily. These rentals cause conflicts at times. Qian plans to construct a freight depot on the originally purchased and leased land. The land is located west of the East Station, which has already developed into a marketplace. It is north of Dama Road and east of Zhongzheng Street, and west of Laibin Lane. This area contains approximately four to five hundred houses and shops. Piling is already underway, and orders to move are being given to the tenants, in order to solicit construction bids. Once this freight depot is completed, a connecting track will be built northward, directly connecting to the main line of the railway at Erbawa, which is about 500 meters in length. The completed track will facilitate the loading and unloading of goods. Platforms will be built on both the east and west sides, with an estimated total construction cost of approximately 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Tenant Issues: There are currently no problems with the right of way for the branch line. The land for the freight depot was originally leased by the Longhai Railway authorities in the fourth year of the Republic (1915) to the Yuanda and Dacheng companies, who then subleased it to merchants and residents. The contract term was two years, specifying that the land should be vacated within two years, with relocation expenses provided by the railway, and that after two years, no compensation would be provided. However, due to their business interests, the tenants were greatly alarmed. On the 15th, 16th, and 17th, they held meetings at the East Station Public Welfare Charity Association, with approximately one thousand people attending. They resolved to petition the railway authorities to consider their business difficulties and exempt them from relocation in order to maintain their businesses. They also selected Yao Chengyi and ten others as representatives to petition the railway. If a resolution cannot be reached, they will petition the government. This dispute appears to require resolution. The text of the petition is appended below: "Representatives of the merchants of Zhongzheng Street, Yao Yi, Yu Donghai, Zhu Guiqi, Zhang Zhuchen, Sun Yunchang, Cao Ziting, Zhang Bitang, Hou Mutao, Lan Haiqiu, Bi Mengfu, etc., humbly petition for understanding and accommodation to preserve our businesses and alleviate our difficulties. We merchants have leased land next to Zhongzheng Street in this city to build houses and conduct business. The land originally belongs to the Longhai Railway and was leased by the Yuanda and Dacheng companies, who subleased it to us. We hoped that the market would thrive and we could share in the profits. Unexpectedly, yesterday we received a letter from the Yuanda and Dacheng companies, stating that the Longhai Railway has expansion plans and the Administration is urgently requesting the land, ordering us to completely demolish the houses north of Dama Road and east of Zhongzheng North Street and hand them over within a limited time. Upon hearing this news, we were struck with dismay, as if by a thunderbolt, and were unable to contain our fear. This is a matter of life and death for us and is not a loss to be compared lightly. If we speak only of the rules, we would not dare to disobey. But if we speak of the circumstances, we must respectfully present our hardships in detail to the Director. We merchants are not wealthy. It was not easy to build our houses at the beginning. The funds required were either obtained by selling our possessions or by borrowing at interest. Our entire families rely on this for their livelihood. Demolishing the houses would truly endanger our lives. We believe that the Director cares about the people's suffering and would not bear to focus on one aspect and allow us to be plunged into despair without finding a way to rescue us. Furthermore, the ring road around the city was originally built by the Director himself during his tenure as the head of the police department. All those who rely on this road for business sing his praises and say that the market of Zhongzheng Street was developed because of the Director. We believe that he would not bear to abandon his previous achievements and cause the people to feel resentful. We have heard that the Director is requisitioning the land for the purpose of adding a connecting track and building a freight depot. Fortunately, there is vacant land to the north that can be used to make arrangements. If you could find a way to preserve our houses, so that our businesses are not lost and the market is not damaged, we merchants would be eternally grateful, and the Director's merits would also be immortalized. Therefore, we jointly request that you grant us special consideration and accommodation, for which we will be eternally grateful." (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Detailed Account of the Fierce Battle Between Troops and Bandits at Sian <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Over two thousand bandits from Taihu occupied Sian town in Changxing County at 8 AM on the 15th. After joint suppression efforts by troops and police, Sian was recaptured at 8 AM on the 16th. All the bandits have scattered and fled. The fierce battle between troops and bandits and the aftermath are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲ Before the Robbery: Before the bandit disturbances, cases of kidnapping and robbery were frequently reported in the vicinity of Sian. The town's police force was very weak, and it was difficult to suppress the bandits because they were scattered. People had to let them roam freely in the countryside. A month ago, rumors were rampant in the town, claiming that over a thousand members of the "Guangde Big Sword Society" had arrived in the nearby mountains, causing panic and unrest. Later, someone named Wang, who had been a drill instructor for the Niudian Bridge Protection Corps, incited his followers, and many petty criminals joined him. The garrisoned troops and police were aware of this, so the town was under de facto martial law. After the firearms of the protection corps at Xiaoxikou, Xucang Bridge, and Xiayuan Ferry were seized by bandits, the situation in the town became extremely critical. People were startled several times a night, with sporadic gunfire continuing throughout the night. As a result, the wealthy moved elsewhere, and the streets were deserted soon after dusk.</p>
<p>▲ Commencement of Fierce Fighting: The headquarters of the Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Security Corps was stationed in Sian, with the Eighth and Ninth Companies defending the town and the Seventh Company stationed in Lincheng. On the 14th, the battalion headquarters received confidential reports that thousands of bandits had arrived in the Changqiao Pass area, with a tendency to attack Sian. In addition to ordering his men to be on strict alert, Battalion Commander Wang secretly ordered the Seventh Company, stationed in Lincheng, to return to Sian to strengthen the defense. The Seventh Company set off immediately upon receiving the order. Near the beach, they heard the sound of gunfire, which sounded as frequent as a string of pearls from a distance of several miles. The bandits had already opened fire with the Security Corps. Before the bandits attacked Sian, they had sent bandits disguised as hawkers and residents to infiltrate the market, first surrounding the entire Ninth Company of the Security Corps. The Eighth Company was operating in the market, fearing harm to the residents, so they withdrew from Sian, detouring to the beach to join the Seventh Company. Upon seeing this, the bandits launched a counterattack. Bullets flew like rain for a time, causing many deaths. After holding out for a long time, the Security Corps had no choice but to retreat to Tiangan Bridge. After a short rest, they retreated to Lincheng Bridge to regroup.</p>
<p>▲ Loss and Recapture: After the Seventh and Eighth Companies of the Security Corps retreated to Lincheng Bridge, the Ninth Company was isolated and difficult to defend. Although they fought bravely against the bandits, more than half of the soldiers had been killed or wounded, so they had to withdraw from Sian, and the entire town fell into the hands of the bandits. At this time, the 30th Regiment of the Fifth Division of the National Army stationed in Changxing heard the alarm and sent the First and Second Battalions, led by Battalion Commanders Feng and Lai, to march to Lincheng on foot. At about 6 PM, Hang Yi, commander of the anti-bandit forces in the Taihu area, arrived by boat and immediately ordered each unit to prepare food at 12 PM and depart at 2 AM. The National Army formed the left wing, the Security Corps formed the right wing, and the 11th Water Police Team, led by Squad Leaders He and Wang, supported the left and right wings, heading towards Sian. Near Kongshan, they encountered a large group of bandits, and fighting ensued. The National Army and the Security Corps then used machine guns and mortars to attack the bandits. The fierce battle lasted for four hours. The bandits suffered more than 300 deaths. Because the military and police fire was fierce and unstoppable, the bandit forces were unable to resist and scattered in retreat. The military and police recaptured Sian at 8 AM on the 15th.</p>
<p>▲ Investigation of Losses: The intensity of this suppression of bandits in Sian was unprecedented. Therefore, the losses of the military and police were also relatively heavy. The Security Corps suffered 30 to 40 casualties (the exact number is still unknown). The National Army and the Water Police suffered similar numbers. The bandits suffered 300 to 400 deaths. One false regimental commander and one deputy regimental commander were killed, and two false battalion commanders were captured alive. More than ten residents were killed or wounded. Major shops in Sian were looted by bandits, with losses exceeding 50,000 yuan. During the fierce battle, the Security Corps seized more than a hundred large swords from the bandits, stained with blood. It is unknown how many lives were poisoned by them.</p>
<p>▲ Aftermath Issues: After the recapture of Sian, Hang Yi, commander of the anti-bandit forces in the Taihu area, and Feng and Lai, battalion commanders of the 30th Regiment of the Fifth Division of the National Army, led their troops to station in the town. In addition to jointly issuing announcements and encouraging merchants and residents to resume business as usual, they also planned to convene residents to discuss the aftermath.</p>
<p>▲ Display of Bandit Leaders' Heads: After being repelled by the military and police, the bandits who occupied Sian scattered towards Meixi, Anji, Changqiao, Xianqiao, Dayun Temple, and other places, with each group numbering about one to two hundred people. Their combat strength was still strong, so the military and police around Lincheng Bridge were on high alert, and the market was extremely deserted. The false overall commander of the bandits, Zhang Minggao (formerly the head of the Changxing County Protection Corps), and the false division commander Chen Zhuangda, were still at large. The false marshals Fu and Wang had been beheaded and displayed to the public.</p>

<p>Pinghu Correspondence: After the bandits led by Taibao Ashu robbed and looted the area bordering Pinghu County and Jiangsu Province, the provincial government dispatched a security corps to pursue and suppress them. The entire Second Battalion of the Seventh Regiment of the Security Corps, including the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Special Companies, led by Battalion Commander Zhao, departed from Pinghu for Xincang. At 2 AM on the 16th, soldiers from the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion of the Third Regiment also arrived. At approximately 5 AM that morning, they divided into two routes from Xincang (one via Quanggong Pavilion, one via Xinmiao) to search and advance in a large encirclement. Battalion Commander Zhao led the Fourth Company and part of the Special Company, advancing from Xinmiao, Liujia Yankiao, Qingduian, Zhuanjiaowan, and returning to Yaqian. Company Commander Ding led the Fifth Company and part of the Special Company, going north from Quanggong Pavilion, passing through Zhujiadun, Zhujiaqiao, Zhangshaqiao to Yaqian. The Ninth Company of the Third Battalion of the Third Regiment then garrisoned Yaqian at 10 AM to guard the rear. The Xinmiao base</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>had two patrol boats of the merchant-run anti-smuggling camp stationed there, which were the area of responsibility for Squad Leader Tao Xiaoda. Based on a confidential report, Battalion Commander Zhao suspected that this squad leader was colluding with bandits. After arriving in the town, he immediately sent someone with a note to summon him. He then found out that Tao was at home in Luwan Temple and secretly ordered several members of the wooden-hulled gun squad to take Tao into custody first. Then, he disarmed the two patrol boats. While on the ship, they found a "38" type Mauser rifle engraved with the words "Dongjiu Yamen Protection Corps," which had been robbed by bandits last year, and a police saber. When they reached the home of bandit leader Taibao Ashu, it was empty, and they burned the house to the ground. At Qingduian, they arrested fifteen suspected criminals in a teahouse and escorted them back with the team. While passing through Zhuanjiaowan, they searched the house of bandit leader Yan Shushen, finding nothing, and also burned down the house of this bandit in Zhuanjiaowan. Company Commander Ding's unit arrested six bandits, a bandit woman, and many stolen goods in the area north of Quanggong Pavilion and Zhujiadun, and escorted them back to Yaqian via Zhangshaqiao. When the two routes reached Yaqian, the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion had also arrived. After arriving in the town, Battalion Commander Zhao sent a team to arrest Zhu Chaoquan, a suspected collaborator of the bandits in the town, surrounding Zhu's house and searching it. Zhu was not at home, and only letters and photos were found. Zhu's father, Hui Shi, and Pei San were arrested and escorted along with the other criminals back to Xincang. Squad Leader Tao Xiaoda of the merchant-run anti-smuggling team was then taken to He by Battalion Commander Zhao, accompanied by a company of soldiers, for interrogation. Before Tao was sent to He, Tao's subordinates had telegraphed Lu Diankui, the head of the merchant-run anti-smuggling camp, who then telegraphed County Magistrate Fang to find a solution. Zhu Hushi and others had already been sent to the county for interrogation. Because the guards were tight-lipped, their confessions could not be found out. At around 9 AM on the 18th, over ten bandit ships, fully loaded with armed bandits, were discovered near Qingyang Hui in Xindai Town, Pinghu County, sailing from Pubei, seemingly heading towards Huzhu Nunnery, Shantang, and Liujia Yankiao. The Pinghu County government received the report and has strengthened its defenses.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture Requests Protection of Fishing Grounds <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines stated that banditry is rampant in the offshore fishing grounds of this province. Last year, as the fishing season was approaching, it had submitted a request to the Provincial Government, which was forwarded to the Executive Yuan, ordering the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the naval fleet stationed in Shanghai to send small warships for protection. The fishing season is now approaching again, and piracy is even more severe than last year in the various fishing grounds. Recently, the "Haiying" fisheries protection warship was robbed at Shengshan, making more stringent protection necessary. Otherwise, the flames of piracy will intensify, and the livelihoods of fishermen will be cut off. It proposed to follow the precedent of last year and respectfully request that the Provincial Government forward a request to the Ministry of the Navy, ordering the fleet stationed in Shanghai to dispatch several small warships to various fishing areas to protect offshore fisheries in order to ensure safety. It is heard that it has submitted a report to the Provincial Government, requesting that it be forwarded.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Crack Down on Japanese Residents in Changli <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>▲ All Nine Japanese Households Sell Morphine</p>
<p>Ping Correspondence: Sun Huanlun, Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, reported to the Provincial Government Committee yesterday that: "Based on the instructions of the Provincial Government, the magistrate of Changli County reported that nine Japanese households reside in the county and specialize in selling morphine and other drugs, which cannot be banned. It is proposed to select spacious temples to accommodate those arrested for smoking opium and injecting morphine, but it would be necessary to provide each person with an allowance of eight cents per day. It is requested that approval be granted to disburse the expenses, after verification, from 70% of the fine revenue of the Escort Bureau. Please issue instructions to comply with these instructions, etc. Based on this, in addition to issuing instructions, it is hereby ordered that the department investigate, handle, and report back. This order, etc. In accordance with this, after reviewing the case, the county had previously submitted a separate report to the department, and instructions were issued to wait for the Provincial Government to review and handle. Based on the previous instructions and after further investigation, the original request from the county is divided into two points: (1) Japanese merchants have opened pharmacies in Changli and are privately selling drugs, making it impossible to investigate and prohibit them. Please propose measures to seriously negotiate, etc. How should these crackdown measures, which are related to foreign affairs, be regulated? It is necessary to propose them for compliance. (2) Strictly prohibit those who are caught using drugs, which is a thorough method. However, the request to disburse the allowance from 70% of the fine revenue of the Escort Bureau involves using judicial fines, which should be handled by the High Court in conjunction with the Finance Department. Are these appropriate? It is respectfully reported to you after recording the county's document. Please make a public decision." The decision was made: (1) All foreign-owned pharmacies that privately sell drugs should be strictly cracked down on. (2) The method is acceptable, but the allowance should be raised locally and is not allowed to use fines. The original report from the Changli County Magistrate is attached below: "The Deputy Director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, Liu Tianfa, reported that: After investigation, there are as many as nine Japanese households residing within the county's borders. Some have resided there for twenty or thirty years, and some have resided there for more than ten years. All of them are using the name of medical practice and selling medicine as a front, but in reality, they specialize in selling drugs such as morphine, cocaine, and heroin. According to investigations, although successive county magistrates and public security bureau directors have tried to ban them, they have often been forcibly taken back by the Shanhaiguan garrison troops after being arrested. Even if some were handed over to the Tianjin Foreign Affairs Office and then sent to the Japanese consulate for legal proceedings, the escorts often had not returned before the criminals had already returned to Changli and continued to sell drugs as before. According to recent investigations, not only people in the lower classes of our country are injecting morphine and using drugs, but also many in the middle and upper classes are addicted to this vice. The depth of its harm and the intensity of its damage will inevitably lead to the destruction of the nation and the extermination of the race. Since taking office, the Director has been deeply concerned and has been eager to strictly prohibit it in order to eliminate the scourge. However, due to diplomatic constraints, there is no good policy. Furthermore, the Japanese are extremely barbaric and unreasonable. Changli is not a treaty port, so how can these Japanese freely trade? Moreover, transporting and selling drugs is a violation of international law. After careful consideration, the Director believes that this kind of poison must not be allowed to spread arbitrarily. In addition to ordering the landlords of the Japanese who sell drugs to take back their houses within a limited time and not allow them to be rented, and strictly investigating and arresting the criminals who buy and use drugs and sending them to the county for punishment, could your government forward a protest to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the Provincial Government and raise it with the Japanese consul? Changli has not been opened as a port, so Japanese merchants should be cracked down on in the territory. Furthermore, criminals arrested in the future should be transferred to the consulate for strict punishment in accordance with the law and should not be lightly released, which would violate international law, and the Japanese consulate should order the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan not to interfere arbitrarily. Are the proposed matters appropriate? It is respectfully requested that you review and forward them for the public convenience, etc. Based on this, after investigating the claim of the bureau director that as many as nine Japanese households reside within the county's borders and that they all use the name of selling medicine as a front but in reality specialize in selling morphine and various drugs, the situation is true. However, Changli is closer to Shanhaiguan, where there is a Japanese military police team stationed. Whenever the county government seizes Japanese who are selling drugs, the garrison troops come to Changli to demand their release. In previous years, there were even cases of forcibly demanding the return of criminals, and the county government was unable to handle them due to diplomatic relations. Although it sometimes reluctantly refused, once the criminal was sent to the Foreign Affairs Office and then transferred to the Japanese consulate, they were mostly sentenced to the lightest fine and then released. There was no serious punishment at all, and the travel expenses for sending the case were not cheap. Sometimes, the escorting officials had not even returned to the county before the criminals had already returned and resumed their business. If this continues, the impact on the opium ban will be no small matter. In order to eliminate the scourge and strictly enforce the ban, the county magistrate intends to request that the Provincial Government hold a meeting to discuss and decide on measures for serious negotiations in order to investigate and prohibit them. The county magistrate further requests that the county is close to Shanhaiguan, and Japanese merchants privately sell drugs at ordinary times, which is indeed very common. Moreover, Changyi is one of the five counties in Bay East, and the recovery of sovereignty was later than in other counties. Therefore, those who smoke opium and inject morphine are still frequently seen. However, eight or nine out of ten of the unemployed poor are involved. Those arrested are subject to fines, but the penalty cannot be applied due to not having the financial resources to pay. There is no special regulation providing a basis for imprisonment. If the arrestees do not receive their dosage of the drug, they develop severe diarrhea, resulting in unhygienic conditions, and overcrowding in prisons. Therefore, it is proposed that the arrestees should be gathered and detoxed in spacious temples with the medical care provided by the local missionary hospital. Each prisoner would require food worth eight cents a day. It is requested that the Provincial Committee meet to decide on whether it is appropriate to use 70 percent of the fines levied to pay for this. It is respectfully requested that your department review and instruct us to comply."</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jin Handing, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian, arrived in the province from Beijing on the 10th and has been holding detailed discussions on bandit suppression plans with Chairman Lu and Brigade Commander Tang for several days. On the afternoon of the 11th, he and Chairman Lu also hosted a banquet for various military officers at the Provincial Government, during which the bandit suppression issue was discussed again. According to Jin's interview with reporters, the 12th Division will leave a unit in the Ninghua area of Fujian, and the majority of the Zhang and Tang Brigades have arrived in southern Jiangxi from Ruijin and Shicheng. The Yang Yingzhi and Xiao Xixian Regiments have been pursuing Zhu and Mao towards the Guangdong border. The Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters also departed from Tingzhou, Fujian, on the 10th and arrived in Ganzhou. I (Jin referring to himself) will go to Ganzhou from the province in the shortest possible time to be responsible for clearing the scattered bandits in Ganzhou, Yudu, Xingguo, Ningdu, and other counties, and for flanking Zhu and Mao with the Guangdong army. Furthermore, bandits and communists are still active along the Gan River in Taihe and Wan'an, Ganzhou, and civilian and steamboat traffic has been disrupted for several months. Master Zhang has now ordered Peng's Regiment of the Zheng Brigade to move up the Gan River from Taihe, and one regiment of the 35th Brigade to move down the river from Ganzhou, flanking each other and clearing the scattered bandits obstructing transportation in order to alleviate the obstruction of the traveler's feet. After being severely suppressed by Zhu's Brigade and Yi's Regiment of the 18th Division and Deng Ying's Brigade in Anfu, Wanzai, Xinyu, Fenyi, Yichun, and other places, the Peng bandits in western Jiangxi are in a miserable state. The Provincial Government received a telegram from Brigade Commander Deng yesterday, reporting that the Peng bandits were unable to resist the pressure and that some had hidden in the Wugong Mountains, while others had fled to Yongxin via Lianhua. Orders have been telegraphed to Wang's and Li's Regiments in Fenyi and Yichun to pursue them. (April 11)</p>

<p>▲ The Executive Yuan has instructed the Shandong Provincial Government to take note.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Although the Yellow River project in Dongming County, Hebei Province, south of the Yellow River, is being carried out in Hebei, once a breach occurs, it will inundate the area of Caozhou, Shandong. The Provincial Government recently submitted a request to the central government, based on the suggestion of Ge Xiangyi, a member of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, to place Dongming County under the jurisdiction of Shandong. Yesterday, the Provincial Government received an order from the Executive Yuan rejecting the request. The order stated: "Upon investigation, the Executive Yuan previously received a request from the Shandong Provincial Government, forwarded from Ge Xiangyi of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, suggesting that the river works on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province and Dongming County be placed under the jurisdiction of Shandong for review and instructions. The Executive Yuan then forwarded it to the Ministry of Interior for deliberation and reply. According to the reply, the original suggestion was made because the Liuzhuang area on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province is particularly dangerous, and other areas are also unsafe. No matter where the danger lies, the harm is all in Shandong. From the 6th to the 18th year of the Republic of China, there were five breaches, causing great losses to the people of western Shandong. The Hebei Provincial Government has been perfunctory in managing the dams and flood prevention, and has not paid attention. Therefore, it is proposed to place Dongming County and the areas of Changyuan and Puyang counties south of the Yellow River under the jurisdiction of Shandong Province, and to place the river works on the south bank of the province under the management of Shandong. Upon investigation, the section of the Yellow River within Hebei Province has frequently been in danger, which is indeed a fact. However, almost the entire Dongming County in Hebei Province is south of the Yellow River, and parts of Changyuan and Puyang counties are also on the south bank of the Yellow River. The proposal to place the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei under the jurisdiction of Shandong Province, and to place Dongming and other places under the jurisdiction of the province, would divide the river works on both banks into two, each looking after its own interests, which may lead to more disputes. Furthermore, regarding the Yellow River affairs, the National Government has previously ordered the establishment of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, which has already established a preparatory office. According to Article 1 of the commission's organizational regulations, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission is directly under the National Government and is in charge of the entire Yellow River and its tributaries, surveying, dredging, irrigation, and all water conservancy fundraising and construction matters. Regarding the Yellow River project, it can be planned and managed as a whole after the commission is formally established. All suggestions can be temporarily shelved. As for the current issues of repairing, managing, and preventing dangers, we request that your esteemed Executive Yuan instruct the two provincial governments to effectively negotiate and cooperate to maintain the current situation and avoid disputes. Please review and approve." It should be approved and handled as discussed.</p>

<p>Measures to Expand the Police Force: The current police force in this county consists of only one company. With rampant bandits in the four villages, it is felt that the defense is inadequate. At the second county administrative meeting of this session, the county government specifically discussed measures to expand the police force. It is proposed to form a large company in accordance with the provincial-level B police force regulations. In addition to the existing company, two more companies will be recruited, including four squads of rifles and one squad each of machine guns and mortars, in order to increase strength. However, the estimated start-up cost is more than 50,000 yuan, and the recurring cost is more than 100,000 yuan. Local public funds are exhausted, and the land value surcharge has reached one percent. Regarding the funding method, it is proposed to solicit donations from wealthy households for the start-up cost in one lump sum, and to implement a household registration tax for the recurring cost. The collection method is to divide the 80,000 households in the county into four classes, excluding those who are poor and unable to pay: (1) Those with assets of 50,000 yuan or more are in the special class, paying 16 yuan per year, accounting for 200 households. (2) Those with assets of 10,000 yuan or more are in the first class, paying 8 yuan per year, accounting for 3,000 households. (3) Those with assets of 5,000 yuan or more are in the second class, paying 4 yuan per year, accounting for 10,000 households. (4) Those with assets of 1,000 yuan or more are in the third class, paying 2 yuan per year, accounting for 6,800 households. The collection will be carried out quarterly each year. As for the one-time collection of start-up fees, the special class will pay an average of 50 yuan per household, and the first class will pay an average of 20 yuan per household, which will collect approximately 70,000 yuan, which is sufficient for application. After review, the conference passed the resolution and will implement it once approved.</p>
<p>Farmers in Shanyang Were Robbed and Reported to the County: On the evening of the 11th, eight or nine bandits with painted faces and weapons suddenly came to the home of Zhou Ala, a farmer in Wujia, Shanyang Township, which belongs to the county.

<p>County Finance Bureau Seeks Loans: Yuan Xiaogu, Director of the Wuxian County Finance Bureau, recently found that the miscellaneous taxes collected for the busy season have been transferred to the province or allocated for various uses.

This money has not yet been secured, but it urgently needs to be allocated. He discussed this with Magistrate Huang and proposed that the two heads of the county bureau should write to the General Chamber of Commerce to borrow 88,000 yuan from the silver and money industries for a period of six months, with the principal and interest to be repaid from the silver collected during the busy season of the 19th year.

They were instructed to follow the ban and switch to other industries within one year. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the association invited its members to hold a meeting at the Jiangjianshang Hall to discuss the measures. It was decided that this ban would hit their industry the hardest, and it was fundamentally related to the origin of the products in Zhejiang and Shaoxing. Moreover, Jiangsu Province is within the scope of sales. If the source is cut off, it will naturally be banned. However, hundreds of millions of workers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces rely on this for a living. If it is banned, the people will have no means of survival. A public letter was sent to the County Chamber of Commerce to request the superiors to withdraw the national decree in order to maintain the livelihood of the people.</p>

(2) The method of rent reduction for tenant farmers during the cocoon market this year was discussed. It was decided that each district should negotiate the rent reduction method and submit it to the county government for record. (3) The tu zheng and bao zheng of each tu have been abolished.

<p>The First Battalion Passes Through Wuxi to Liyang to Suppress Bandits: Sian Town in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, was captured by bandits on the 15th of this month. It has been recovered by the bandit suppression commander of the West District, Zhong Huan, who led his team to encircle and suppress the bandits. Fearing that the remaining bandits would disturb other counties, the headquarters telegraphed Liu Guanlong, battalion commander of the First Battalion of the 265th Regiment of the 133rd Brigade of the 45th Division, originally stationed in Yangzhou, to lead the entire battalion of officers and soldiers to Liyang to defend and suppress the bandits. The Wuxi County Government received a telegram from the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, instructing it to quickly prepare boats. At 8:30 p.m., more than 500 soldiers of the First Battalion, led by Battalion Commander Liu, arrived in Xishi by six trains from the town, and immediately disembarked and headed to Liyang.</p>
<p>Difficulties in Wuxi-Changzhou Road Construction: The Wuxi-Changzhou Provincial Road, which was requisitioning labor for road construction, was originally scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. Due to rain, it was postponed to the 18th. However, when staking, spraying, and printing gray lines, the people of Shouzhitown, Dongting Township, and Chajiaqiao, etc., in the tenth district, objected that the Construction Bureau changed the old road's previous straight path and instead sought a circular new route, believing that it was abandoning the near for the far. The villagers' representatives Zhu Mogu and Lu Zhongxian, etc., submitted petitions to the Department of Construction and the Construction Bureau, stating that the new route was entirely between the fields, which would require much land and bridge filling, making the project very large and far from the old route, which was detrimental to the public and harmful to the people. They requested that personnel be dispatched again to inspect the route in order to change the route. On the first day of requisitioning labor to start construction, the people of the 1278910th and other districts, which are near the route, were all holding a wait-and-see attitude. There are still many difficulties in starting construction. Yao Dixi, Director of the Construction Bureau, had a serious discussion with Magistrate Sun, but there was no adequate solution. It has now been decided to submit a report to the Provincial Department for review and decision.</p>

<p>approved the envoy's reply, agreeing to the increase, although after increasing two seats, the number of Chinese directors in the Public Concession, is only five seats out of the fourteen seats, compared to half Chinese and English in your area, it is indeed inferior, as for the principle of allowing eleven seats out of twenty seats according to the proportion of taxes paid, it is even more distant, however, our association in order to express sincerity and cooperation, and to seek perfection, agreed to temporarily accept, and then gradually increase, that is, in the present month, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsun, Liu Hongsheng and other five gentlemen were elected as Chinese directors of the Shanghai Public Concession Works Bureau, unexpectedly at the same time the Public Concession Taxpayer's Western Association, actually overstepped its authority to discuss the increase of Chinese directors, and the British lawyer McDonald, made a stubborn speech, the Westerners present, were incited by him, for a time blindly vetoed, our association heard the news, thinking of the past two years, our Chinese citizens, in order to seek Sino-foreign cooperation and to seek perfection, the painstaking efforts, are now by one person's arrogance, and the blind following of a small number of Western taxpayers present, and all destroyed, painful beyond measure, indignation is the same, that is, on the same day, convened an emergency meeting of representatives, according to the principle that Western taxpayers have no right to discuss or decide on the civic rights that Chinese taxpayers should have, issued a formal declaration, believing that the Western Taxpayers Association vetoing the increase of Chinese directors case, of course, invalid, on one hand, publicly recommending representatives, to petition the Foreign Ministry, reasonable negotiation, must achieve the goal, all these experiences, are then disclosed in the newspaper, please accept our respects, but thinking of the concession as the territory of our Republic of China, foreigners relying on their imperialist forces, using improper methods, to seize various undue rights, we are striving for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation, its greatest effort and ultimate goal, is to recover the concessions, the increase in the number of directors, was originally a very large concession before this goal has been achieved, now the Shanghai Public Concession Taxpayer's Western Association, actually acted as the host, overstepping its authority to veto, this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated, our association has suffered this humiliation, should have a deeper understanding of the greatest struggle, to the legitimate track, to achieve the purpose, because thinking that you are also in the concession, for our association's efforts to fight for the movement of civil rights, should have the situation, with a special brief description of the outline, Chen left and right, and for all of you elected as Tianjin Works Bureau Chinese Directors congratulations, if you are willing to give us your support, to give our support, to encourage and accelerate success, especially hope, Shanghai Concession Taxpayer's Chinese Association.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Westerners' Special Meeting <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to be held on May 2nd</p>
<p>▲ Petition will be sent out on Tuesday</p>
<p>Most foreigners in this city consider the Western taxpayers' annual meeting held on Wednesday to have made a serious mistake by rashly rejecting the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Public Concession. Moreover, they believe that the number of people present at the meeting, only over two hundred, is not enough to be a true representative assembly. Now, in order to remedy the spirit of Sino-foreign cooperation, they have decided to convene a special meeting to resubmit the proposal for voting. According to reliable sources from the Western community, the special meeting is currently scheduled to be held on May 2nd at the City Hall. Although the date of the meeting is not yet formally decided, the majority of those involved believe that that day is the most suitable. Because that day is Friday, after that it will be Saturday and Sunday, and later, the three days from May 5th to 7th will be the Spring Racing season. There is even less certainty of obtaining the quorum for the meeting. Therefore, if the special meeting cannot be held on May 2nd, it will inevitably be postponed for a week until May 9th before it can be convened. This will inevitably lead to complications and make the deadlock that has already been formed even more difficult to resolve. Due to the rule that a meeting cannot be held until ten days after the notice, it is also impossible to hold it earlier. Due to various reasons, the meeting date of May 2nd is generally expected to become a reality. As for the petition to convene the special meeting, the joint signatures of twenty-five taxpayers are still being negotiated. It is expected that there will be ten to fifteen British, five Americans, five Japanese, and five Europeans to support it. Recently, due to the Easter holiday, many Westerners are on vacation. Although many have already verbally agreed, it will take at least until Monday tomorrow to complete the formalities for obtaining twenty-five signatures on the petition. At that time, the petition will be led by the President of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Marshall, and will be directly submitted to the Consular Body on Tuesday. On the same day, the Consular Body will convene a meeting of the Consular Body and formally announce the convening of the special meeting in the name of all the consuls of various countries in this city. Important figures from the foreign community now only hope that the Chinese community will understand and avoid causing unexpected disturbances so that the special meeting will not be adjourned due to a lack of quorum.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News stated that the weakness of a representative government is that it cannot represent the views of the entire body. No matter how carefully a legislative body deliberates, it may sometimes be manipulated by a minority. This kind of bad phenomenon occurs from time to time in legislative bodies around the world. Unfortunately, the Western taxpayers' meeting also turned into the same unfortunate event by rejecting the Chinese directors' case. Since the rejection problem occurred, this newspaper believes that this move was unexpected and very surprising, so it tried its best to solicit the opinions of people from all countries in Shanghai. As a result, it was found that the public did not agree with the rejection. On the day of the meeting, very few people attended. Those who were absent did not pay attention to the proposal. Most thought that everyone knew the benefits of the problem, so it would be easy to pass, so there was no need to personally attend the meeting and vote in favor. However, this idea was not perfect. As a taxpayer, one should respect legislative rights, attend meetings, and exercise their rights in order to avoid being manipulated. Now, because of the absence of these people, the Chinese directors' case was rejected, then those who were absent must bear some responsibility. As for those who attended, some originally intended to support the Works Bureau's proposal, but after hearing McDonald's sophistry, they did not know how to refute it, thinking that the full reasons for the proposal would not be subdued by McDonald's remarks, so they did not bother to argue with him. The most surprising thing is that some taxpayers who attended the meeting did vote against it at the time, but later realized their mistake and regretted it. According to what this newspaper knows, the error of the rejection is now being corrected, but the procedures are not easy. A special meeting cannot be convened unless two-thirds of the number attend. Although it concerns the interests of the entire city of Shanghai, the leaders of the foreign community in Shanghai will definitely come forward to plan and ensure that the special meeting is established to make up for past mistakes. In short, people from all countries in Shanghai recognize this rejection as a major unfortunate event. It is hoped that the Chinese community will recognize the truth and not allow a small number of foreigners' blind actions to cause unexpected damage to the good friendship between China and foreign countries.</p>

<p>▲ Staying in Shanghai Briefly to Observe the French Intentions</p>
<p>The Sino-French Vietnam Treaty negotiations have been deliberately delayed by the French ambassador and have been stalled for a long time. Yunnan Provincial Government Committee Member Zhang Weihan, who was scheduled to return to Yunnan by boat on the 23rd, made a special trip to the Information Office on Avenue Joffre at 11:00 AM yesterday to call on Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting to ask for instructions on everything. The Foreign Minister still asked Zhang to stay in Shanghai briefly to observe the French intentions. According to Zhang's statement to reporters, the Vietnam Treaty is difficult to resolve due to the French ambassador's lack of sincerity. Minister Wang still asked me to stay in Shanghai, so I had to obey and postpone the departure.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Chinese and Japanese Silk and Other Goods Should Be Mutually Beneficial <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>▲ National Goods Maintenance Association Cables the Foreign Ministry</p>
<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association yesterday cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating: Wang Junjian, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Executive Yuan, National Government of the Capital, on the twelfth of this month, a telegram was sent, requesting your wise consideration. For many days, no instructions have been received, causing deep anxiety. It is believed that at the time of the revision and signing of the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, if Chinese goods that are sold well in Japan and South Korea, such as silk satin, gauze, summer cloth, porcelain, sundries, and medicinal materials, can be included in the mutual benefit, and the tax rates are the same as those for Japanese goods entering China, then although our country's industry and commerce have previously lost the East, we can still recover the mulberry elm in the West. And the foreign trade, which has been rejected by Japan's harsh taxes, can also be slightly saved. Otherwise, Japanese goods are transported to China, and we give them favorable light taxes, while Chinese silk, etc., are transported to Japan and South Korea, and still heavily taxed, and there is no change. For seven or eight years, we have been running around and appealing, with a glimmer of hope in this revision of the commercial treaty, and we are afraid that we will still be disappointed as before. The issue of revising the commercial treaty, which is closely related to the strength and decline of society and the country, has not given the industrial and commercial circles the opportunity to participate in the discussion. After the other party brazenly announced it, our foreign affairs authorities remained silent and kept it secret. What is the meaning of this kind of revolutionary diplomacy and the people's livelihood doctrine? Our association has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from various groups such as silk, summer cloth, and porcelain from various places, inquiring about what goods are included in the mutual benefit agreement in the new Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty. If our Chinese goods can be included in the mutual benefit when transported to Japan and South Korea, and can be the same as the tax rules for Japanese goods entering China, then we should quickly prepare and refine the products in order to restore the sales in Japan and South Korea and continue business. If we miss the opportunity to revise the treaty this time and repeat the mistakes, benefiting them but not benefiting us, then not only will there be no hope of recovery for Chinese silk, etc., and the country will be in danger of perishing, but also a bad precedent will be set, and various countries will follow suit, and the international status will be permanently lost to the bottom of the sea, harming the party and the country without end. Our association is anxious like fire, not considering the trouble, and forced to telegraph again to appeal, hoping that the lords will approve the acceptance and must achieve equal tax rules for both Chinese and Japanese silk and various goods. Otherwise, do not sign, and ask for immediate implementation and prompt instructions, which will be a great convenience for the people of the country. Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, and Wang Hanqiang, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association, respectfully request.</p>

<p>▲ To be received by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai International Settlement Provisional Court was recovered, Sino-foreign appeal cases within the Settlement were handled by the former Sino-Foreign Mixed Court of the Diplomatic Bureau. Later, the Diplomatic Bureau was abolished at the end of last year, and at that time, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Shanghai High Court in the Settlement had not yet been established. All case files related to Sino-foreign appeals in the Diplomatic Bureau were temporarily handed over to the External Affairs Office in Shanghai for safekeeping. Now that the Provisional Court has been reorganized into the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Shanghai High Court, which was formally established on the first of this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an order to Chen Shiguang, the head of the Shanghai Office, yesterday, instructing him to hand over the case files of the former Sino-Foreign Mixed Court of the Diplomatic Bureau to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Shanghai High Court for inspection and acceptance. It is said that the office will send a letter to the court tomorrow, requesting them to send personnel to verify and accept the files.</p>

<p>▲ Ma Wenxiang Detained</p>
<p>Xin Shanghai News reported that more than 200 acres of Pudong Gaohang District Pubin Dangtian, which belonged to Shanghai City, were fraudulently sold to a certain foreign firm by Ma Wenxiang in collusion with local people, forging field deeds, and obscuring the facts.

Therefore, the municipal party branch was requested to consult the local court and the municipal government for investigation. After learning about it, the municipal government and the court attached great importance to the case, and ordered the Public Security Bureau to detain Ma Wenxiang. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the court specially summoned both parties to the Sixth Criminal Court for investigation by Inspector Yang Wenjun. The plaintiffs were Yu Zhenhui and Qu Xing, representatives of the Eleventh District Branch, and the defendant was Ma Wenxiang, and five or six witnesses who were also involved in the sale. Inspector Yang prohibited the public from attending the hearing because the case was under investigation. The investigation resulted in the detention of Ma Wenxiang. In the next few days, he will personally go to the district to verify the facts before making a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Various Counties of Shaanxi Province <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Disaster Situation is Tragic, Heartbreaking to Hear</p>
<p>▲ It is Resolved that the Distribution of Relief Funds Should be Expedited</p>
<p>News from the Shanghai Office of the Relief Committee: The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is becoming increasingly severe. The following is a summary of the report from the Shaanxi Disaster Situation News Agency: (1) After the snow melted in Wugong County, human bones were found everywhere. The county relief branch is digging pits to bury them. The number of people who starved to death can be seen from this. The daughter-in-law of the Dai family in Shejiabao, Baiyangzhai, was only twenty years old. Both her parents-in-law starved to death, leaving only her husband and a one-year-old daughter. Unable to make a living and her husband being ill, she sold herself again for six silver dollars. The daughter-in-law breastfed her daughter before leaving, tears streaming down her face, reluctant to leave. Then, she jumped into a well. The well was 25 feet deep. She was pulled out, but not dead. Hundreds of women in the county are being sold out of the province every day. The tragic scene is truly rare. (2) Hua County is a small place with a dense population and little production of beans and wheat. People mostly rely on planting timber and mountain fruits for a living. Last winter, the snow fell two feet, and the sun was not seen for three months. There has never been such severe cold in a hundred years, and all the trees have withered. The county originally had 141,058 people, and 35,832 people have died. Thousands of people are buried in mounds of graves. The surviving victims cannot even get a single meal of bran a day. Since the beginning of spring, the epidemic has been spreading. Victims on the verge of death die even faster if they contract the epidemic. The number of deaths in recent days is truly alarming. (3) The disaster situation in Mei County is extremely tragic. The original population was 90,746, and 69,293 people have died. More than 2,100 households have been wiped out. Many victims are fleeing to Xinghan. Most of the houses have been demolished. More than 200 villages in the county, dozens of villages south of the official road, are uninhabited. The fields are barren, and Artemisia are forming forests. There is land but no one to plant it, and those who have people do not have cattle or seeds. Even if there is ample rain, the fields are still barren. It is feared that even after twenty years, the vitality will be difficult to restore. (4) The National Government has resolved to allocate 300,000 yuan for relief in Shaanxi. It is hoped that the Ministry of Finance will be able to understand the government's intention to save the victims and will be able to find a way to allocate the funds as soon as possible. The Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association's telegram to Yu Youren is recorded below: Mr. Yu, I have received your telegram. Your proposal to allocate funds for relief in Shaanxi has been resolved and handed over to the Ministry of Finance to allocate 300,000 yuan. I am deeply moved by your concern for your hometown and your compassion for the hungry. It is now a time when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in. With this relief, the general victims can celebrate their rebirth. Please expedite the distribution to provide emergency relief. Thank you in advance. The Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association bows.</p>

<p>▲ Marks His Birthday with Mourning</p>
<p>This month, the 18th, was Yu Youren's 53rd birthday. Many of his fellow villagers gathered at his residence in Shanghai, intending to offer him congratulations. Yu believed that the disaster situation in Shaanxi was urgent, people were dying every day, and his heart was troubled by the disaster area, so he refused to allow celebrations and instructed his secretary to issue a notice. All fellow villagers who came were given a black gauze to attach to their sleeves to commemorate the people who died of starvation in the disaster. On this day, although many guests gathered in Yu's residence, the atmosphere was solemn and everyone was sadly thinking of the famine-stricken hometown. The notice from his secretary is recorded below: Today we respectfully wish Mr. Yu Youren a happy birthday. Mr. Yu believes that the disaster situation in Shaanxi is tragic, and more than two million people are starving to death, but no relief has been provided. He is exhausted and feels extremely painful. Fellow villagers have come, but he could not stop them. Mr. Yu feels extremely uneasy and specially requested that black gauze be prepared for fellow villagers to wear to express their sorrow for the people who died of starvation in their hometown. It is also to remind his colleagues to be vigilant about disasters. Mr. Yu and his family will all follow this, and he ordered that this intention be conveyed. I hope that my fellow villagers will understand. On this day, everything Yu discussed was related to disaster relief, and those who heard it were solemn.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Record of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Committee Meeting <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association held a committee meeting yesterday. Attendees included Wang Yiting, Chu Huiseng, Qu Wenliu, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Shenzhi, and dozens of others. Wang Yiting chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Standards for the distribution of relief funds: Except for the relief funds remitted by the Nanjing Headquarters and the Relief Committee that are designated for the Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures, 50% of the funds received by this association will be allocated to the Wenzhou and Taizhou prefectures, and 50% will be allocated to the other disaster-stricken counties. Except for Wenzhou and Taizhou, the scope of the disaster relief funds distributed by this association will be the counties that have been allocated funds by the Zhejiang Relief Committee for disaster relief (25 counties in total). However, if this association inquires with the governments of these counties about the spring relief measures, and the county government does not reply, or if they reply but have not determined the relief measures, this association will not provide relief. (2) Director in charge of preparing the lottery: Mr. Lu Shaoliu was recommended to take the position. (3) Directors of the calligraphy and painting department of the exhibition: Mr. Li Zuhan, Shen Tianxin, Wu Dongmai, Yao Yuqin, and Yang Qingqin were recommended to take the positions.

It is also reported that the association has collected no less than 30,000 to 40,000 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, and items from all walks of life.

<p>According to Deng Liangfu and Xia Zexian, the China Jisheng Society reported that on March 28th, they took a long-distance bus from Guzhen Station on the Jinpu Railway to Lingbi County, northern Anhui, for investigation. It was seven days and nights after the war between soldiers and bandits. Dozens of victims were killed by stray bullets, more than 100 houses were burned, more than 200 women were raped, and the people of the entire county were spared from being robbed. At this time of great disaster, when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, the voices of those who survived the robbery, crying for hunger and cold, are endless. Not only are the disaster-stricken households in the countryside too numerous to count, but there are also one or two thousand households in the city that cannot survive without relief. It is hoped that philanthropists will have compassion and make vows to save these survivors and relieve them of their suffering.</p>

<p>The Iron Blood Wounded Soldiers Committee of the Wuchang Uprising in 1911 sent personnel to Shanghai to carry out everything for raising funds for the wounded soldiers' factory. It has been reported in the previous newspaper. The representatives have visited the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department to request guidance and have successively written to local gentry and businessmen Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Chen Dezheng, and Yang Qingshan, asking for assistance. It is reported that the Municipal Government has ordered the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to provide assistance at any time. Therefore, the representatives, in order to be cautious, intend to hold a theatrical performance to raise funds or carry out fundraising after communication with all sectors is properly arranged. It is believed that there is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai who will be able to contribute generously to the voices of these wounded comrades who started the uprising and complete this righteous act.</p>

<p>The Capital National Products Exhibition Hall is scheduled to hold a silk exhibition for one month starting on May 5th, and has specifically set up a collection office in Shanghai at the Commodity Exhibition Hall of the Local Business Reorganization Office. It has notified the silk industry groups and factories to prepare new products to be sent to the office for transfer to the capital.

<h3 id="e102">The Ministry of Communications Rejects the Postal Workers Union's Salary Increase <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union previously stated that the customs employees had increased their salaries and that the treatment was unfair. It requested the General Post Office to forward a request to the Ministry of Communications for an improvement plan and to increase the salary subsidies for compensation. It is now known that the bureau received an order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday rejecting the request. The original order stated: Upon investigation, postal workers have repeatedly requested improvements in their treatment due to unfair treatment. This ministry has adopted a compromise method to revise it separately. Although the salaries of senior personnel have been slightly reduced, the treatment of general staff is indeed better than before. It is certainly not the case that the cost of living is increasing, and the impact is not only on postal personnel. It has not been heard that any agency has requested to revise their salaries as a result. The donations are prepared by the Central Party Department for special funds for party member compensation. All personnel serving the party and the country cannot violate party orders and delay payment. All agencies are now paying uniformly and there is no additional subsidy as a result. The amount to be paid is based on the salary as a ratio, and those with lower salaries are not required to pay, so there is no impact on livelihoods. The post office is a state-run transportation business and is similar in nature to the road and telecommunications administrations. The customs has special circumstances. How can the Postal Workers Union, which once belonged to the customs, use the same origin as an excuse to compare everything? The request to increase the salary rate or subsidy should not be discussed. You should check and inform them accordingly.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Strike by Public Concession Bus Drivers</p>
<p>The drivers of the Public Concession buses, due to the recent high cost of rice and firewood and the difficulty of maintaining a living, recently sent representatives to meet with the company secretary, Mr. Peng Le, to apply for a wage increase. Mr. Peng told them that the company had already automatically increased wages across the board by 8% to 10% starting April 1st, and that it was not convenient to increase them again at this time. The representatives argued briefly and then left the office, continuing to work as usual. However, yesterday morning, all types of workers arrived on time, but the drivers did not, so all the Public Concession buses did not operate yesterday.</p>
<p>The Flourishing Real Estate Business in This Port</p>
<p>▲ Land Prices Rise</p>
<p>The *Da Wan Bao* reports that many important figures in the real estate industry expect that real estate transactions in Shanghai will become increasingly prosperous, and that their value will soon double. For example, a vacant lot on Avenue Joffre that was recently worth 185,000 yuan has now risen to over 200,000 yuan. Also, real estate on Bubbling Well Road has greatly increased in price in a very short period of time, all of which are clear signs. It is said that since the beginning of January this year, a large number of real estate transactions, both large and small, have been concluded, and their total value has far exceeded that of the same period last year. This is because there is a large amount of silver stored in the Shanghai market, the price of silver is low, and the exchange rate is unfavorable, so people are investing in real estate. In addition, many people from the interior are moving to Shanghai due to local unrest, and the population of this port has greatly increased, so there is more cash and purchasing power, which is said to be one of the reasons for the rapid increase in real estate prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate and Assize Office to Be Renovated</p>
<p>The *Da Wan Bao* reports that the buildings of the U.S. Consulate General and the Assize Office in this port will be demolished and renovated.

<p>Arrests Made by the Police in One Week</p>
<p>The *Da Wan Bao* reports that during the last period, the Public Concession police arrested a total of 174 people suspected of committing crimes, including one murder, seven armed robberies, four pickpockets, eight purse snatchers, and one kidnapping.</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Changes the Pricing Method for Ship License Plates and Lights</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities handles the registration of cargo ships. Originally, each ship had to obtain two license plates, one for the hull and one for the seat, and four inlaid wooden strips, and pay a deposit of four yuan for the license plates. The pricing method for returning or reissuing license plates and lights was also determined according to this amount. Now, the deposit for the license plates has been changed to three yuan, but the previously determined pricing method has not been changed. Therefore, if a shipowner obtains a full set, he only pays three yuan, but if he returns them separately, he can get four yuan, and some unscrupulous people inevitably take advantage of this. The municipal treasury suffers a loss. Therefore, the bureau submitted a request to the central government a few days ago to set a new pricing method, namely, two yuan for the return of two license plates, six jiao for one light, eight fen for one light seat, and three jiao two fen for four inlaid strips, totaling three yuan. However, if they are lost and need to be reissued, the cost is higher due to piecemeal preparation, and to warn people to use them carefully, the price of each item is slightly higher, namely, two yuan eight jiao for two license plates, seven jiao for one light, one jiao for one light seat, and four jiao for four inlaid strips, totaling four yuan. All shipping offices have been ordered to comply.</p>
<p>Automobile Driver's License</p>
<p>▲ Should Be Sent to the Bureau of Public Utilities for Review</p>
<p>Article 8 of the Municipal Regulations for the Management of Automobile Drivers stipulates that automobile drivers should submit their licenses to the Bureau of Public Utilities for review once every full year from the date of issuance, and pay a handling fee of one yuan each time. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has now found that many drivers who have been licensed for a full year have not complied with the regulations and submitted them for review. Yesterday, a special announcement was issued to all drivers that if their licenses have been issued for a year, they should submit them for review immediately, otherwise, once discovered, they will be punished in accordance with item 9 of Article 9 of the regulations.</p>
<p>French Consul General Hang Yu Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Gan Kelin, the French Consul General in Shanghai, traveled to Hangzhou with his entourage on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train on the 15th to visit the scenic West Lake. When the train arrived at the Hangzhou station, the Mayor of Hangzhou, Zhou Xiangxian, Yang Yanqing from the military and police, and personnel from various institutions, as well as more than 20 gentry and businessmen from Hangzhou, came to the station to welcome him. They each held small flags in their hands, which was quite a grand occasion. Mr. Gan got off the train, shook hands with each of the welcomers, took off his hat to salute, and then took a car to the Lakeside West Lake Hotel to stay. He had a very strong desire to travel in the following days, touring all the scenic spots, famous mountains, and ancient temples in West Lake, admiring them endlessly. The某 Art School on the lakeside also invited Mr. Gan to visit the school, and he greatly praised the rapid progress of Chinese art and culture, which far surpassed that of Western countries. Mr. Gan made a short stay in Hangzhou, and now that his tour is over, he returned to Shanghai by train yesterday.</p>
<p>The Issue of Chinese Nationality in Debt Cases</p>
<p>▲ Xu Ruilin Had Already Entered British Nationality</p>
<p>▲ Plaintiff's Lawyer Believes It Is Invalid</p>
<p>Hu Songnian, a broker at the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, hired a lawyer to represent him in a lawsuit in the French court, stating that the defendants Xu Ruilin and Gao Junfeng, in the name of Chengji Trading Company, previously entrusted the plaintiff to buy and sell public bonds totaling more than 1.1 million yuan. The defendants signed a transaction note as proof. As of March 11 this year, it was calculated that they owed 48,890.64 yuan in silver. They were asked to pay, but they ignored the request, so the case was filed for prosecution. The defendant Xu Ruilin, through his lawyer, argued that his client Xu Ruilin was born in England and had long been a British citizen, and that he had a passport to prove it. The plaintiff's accusation was not within the jurisdiction of the court and should be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer also replied that, according to the Nationality Law, the defendant must produce a certificate of renunciation of nationality from the Ministry of the Interior for it to be effective. Since there was no certificate, it was naturally invalid. Since the defendant was born in England and is now returning to his country, he should be subject to the judgment of the court of his own country. The Nationality Law has clear regulations and cannot be considered valid based on the defendant's one-sided statement. He requested a clear investigation. The defendant Gao Junfeng also defended everything through his lawyer. Judge Gong ordered them to leave and wait for a decision on the nationality issue before further investigation.</p>
<p>Failure to Redeem Property Deeds on Time</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Business Company Files a Complaint</p>
<p>▲ Requesting Permission to Dispose of the Collateral</p>
<p>The land broker Zhang Wenxiang mortgaged three property deeds for houses located on Zhengjia Wood Bridge in the French Concession to the American-owned Chinese Business Company for 10,000 taels of silver at the end of September last year, with an interest rate of 1% per month. Recently, because Zhang failed to redeem the deeds on time, the company hired a lawyer to sue in the Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to repay the principal and interest of the mortgage, or that the collateral be disposed of. If the proceeds from the auction are not enough to pay the debt, the defendant should still be required to make up the difference. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang opened a court session to summon the defendant, who also hired a lawyer to appear in court, raising the issue of jurisdiction, saying that the mortgaged property and the mortgage act were both in the French Concession, and the plaintiff should file a lawsuit in the French Concession. The plaintiff's lawyer strongly opposed this issue, saying that the plaintiff was an American businessman and operated in the Public Concession, so the case should naturally be handled by the Special District Court. Judge Yang then decided that the court had jurisdiction over the case and ordered the plaintiff to submit evidence for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<p>A Lawyer's Broker Forges Checks</p>
<p>▲ Defrauding a Deposit of 1,250 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison, Still to Appeal</p>
<p>Tan Zhongxi, a Guangdong native, was previously a broker at Feng Zhongba's law office on Szechuan Road. On the 12th of last month, Tan stole the lawyer's checkbook and seal, and then forged Feng's name to defraud the Guangdong Bank of 1,250 yuan of Feng's deposit. After being discovered, it was reported to the General Police Station, and Tan was arrested and detained for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen of the Special District Local Court brought Tan to trial. Feng Zhongba testified that the defendant had fraudulently obtained his deposit and requested punishment. Tan denied everything, saying that he had a quarrel with Feng.</p>
<p>Page 16</p>
<p>Because Tan Zhongxi reported that the signature on the check signed by the defendant was confirmed to be the defendant's handwriting after being enlarged by photography. Judge Shen immediately sentenced Tan Zhongxi to one year and two months in prison. Tan's attorney stated in court that Tan was not satisfied and requested permission to appeal, so the case cannot yet be considered closed.</p>
<p>Attention Ship Owners Anchoring in Ports</p>
<p>▲ Must Leave Immediately When the Whistle Sounds</p>
<p>▲ No Responsibility for Collisions If Not Obeyed</p>
<p>Various ship companies along the southern city's riverbank have investigated and found that the equipment at each wharf was originally intended for merchant ships to drop anchor when arriving at the port. However, various types of vessels often compete to moor and line up outside the outer defenses of the port terminals. When the merchant ships of each company arrive in Shanghai and turn around to dock at the terminals prepared by the company, the various vessels do not rush to leave the docks even after hearing the sound of the whistle, but instead continue to moor as before, without moving at all. As a result, collisions occur from time to time. Therefore, each of the ship companies contacted each other and proposed methods to ban this behavior. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, stating the various hazards and requesting that all ship owners be notified. It was stated that if shipowners continue to disobey in the future, the companies will not be responsible for any collisions that occur.</p>
<p>Punishment for Failure to Affix Stamps to Account Books</p>
<p>The Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau has been sending inspectors to check stamps in the Nanhui Ferry area of ​​Pudong in recent days. The inspection has been quite strict. A total of five shops were found to be in violation of regulations. The account books and other items were taken back for separate punishment. Yesterday, the Third District Public Security Bureau was notified to send police to enforce the penalties. The penalized establishments are as follows: (1) Dachang Nanhua Store was found to have two account books without stamps, fined 10 yuan. (2) Guangtaichang Cigarette Shop was found to have three stamped account books without seals and signatures, fined 10 yuan. (3) Hongfaxiang Cigarette Paper Shop was found to have two unstamped account books, fined 10 yuan. (4) Xinglong Socks Shop was found to have two understamped books, fined 10 yuan. (5) Datonghe Nanhua Store was found to have one unstamped account book and one license, fined a total of 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Banning Women from Singing in the Streets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an announcement yesterday, stating, "The police have the responsibility to correct customs, because customs are the manifestation of social morality. Bad customs should be strictly prohibited and gradually eliminated in order to bring them into line with the right path and jointly promote enlightenment. Recently, in various restaurants and taverns in this city, young women often bring young girls, holding playbills in their hands, and ask the guests to order songs, which is extremely frivolous, corrupts customs, and harms morals. In addition to issuing orders to the various districts to strictly prohibit this, a public announcement is made for everyone to know. From now on, if the aforementioned circumstances occur again, once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. Everyone must comply and not violate this announcement."</p>
<p>Lawsuit for Cohabitation with a Lieutenant's Wife</p>
<p>▲ Allowance of 12 Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>▲ On-the-Spot Reconciliation Achieved</p>
<p>Ji Hanwenshu, a young woman from Anhui, recently hired lawyers Jin Yu and Li Yuan to sue her husband, Ji Kegong, in the Shanghai Local Court for abandonment and to demand cohabitation. The wording of the complaint stated, "On the 29th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the 17th year of the Republic of China, I married the defendant, Ji Kegong, through a matchmaker. Unexpectedly, only six days after the marriage, on the fifth day of the eleventh month, the defendant went to work in the army in Hankou. Since then, he has repeatedly sent letters to his parents-in-law and the plaintiff, requesting a divorce. On the 27th day of the second month of last year, the defendant finally came to Shanghai, but he did not often talk to the plaintiff. At that time, the defendant was infected with syphilis and was only cured in April. Then he went out again. The plaintiff had no choice but to rely on her elder brother and sister-in-law for a living and requested a court judgment." Yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, Judge Wang specially opened the Fourth Court for trial. The plaintiff, Ji Hanwenshu, stated that she was 24 years old, from Anhui, and recounted the previous events. She also said, "Now, whether the defendant wants me or not, I am determined to become a nun." The judge repeatedly tried to persuade her. The plaintiff also said, "The defendant must work in Shanghai." The judge questioned the defendant, Ji Kegong, who stated that he was 25 years old, from Shanghai, residing in Longhua West Town, and currently working in the Wireless Telegraph First Battalion of the First Regiment of the Transportation Corps of the Commander-in-Chief of the Land and Sea Forces in Xuzhou (as a lieutenant), with a monthly salary of 42 yuan. At this point, the plaintiff submitted many letters from the defendant requesting a divorce, requesting the court to investigate. She also said, "The defendant has someone else he likes in Hanyang, Hubei. She is a woman from Sichuan, as told to me by the defendant's younger brother. I don't think it's false." The judge asked the defendant if this was true, and he replied, "No, but now that social interaction between men and women is open, there may be female colleagues traveling with me at work, which cannot be immediately interpreted as improper." He continued, "Now that the plaintiff is requesting to live together again, I am willing." The judge then said to the plaintiff, "I order the defendant to pay you a living allowance of 12 yuan per month." The plaintiff replied, "Twelve yuan is not enough, because I need to study now, because the defendant dislikes that I am illiterate." The judge said, "Don't deliberately make things difficult," and gave the plaintiff various analogies. The plaintiff nodded in agreement, and a reconciliation was achieved. The defendant will pay the plaintiff a living allowance of 12 yuan per month by the end of each month. The judge wrote a reconciliation record and ordered both parties to sign it. All the letters submitted by the plaintiff were returned in court. The defendant requested that the letters be burned in court, but the plaintiff refused. The judge said that since a reconciliation had been reached, there were no issues with the letters, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>Xiao Lanzi Does Not Want to Marry a Country Bumpkin</p>
<p>▲ Sues for Dissolution of Marriage</p>
<p>Zhu Xiao Lanzi, a 22-year-old woman from Gaoyou, was betrothed at the age of 17 to Zuo Da, a villager from the Bansongyuan area of Shanghai. Last year, Xiao Lanzi came to Shanghai and worked as a maid for a family surnamed 某 in Shaoqing Lane on Rue Lafayette. Influenced by what she saw and heard, she no longer wanted to return to her hometown. She hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the local court requesting the dissolution of the marriage, claiming that the betrothal was made without her consent and was a completely autocratic marriage in the form of a sale. The plaintiff has been working as a maid in Shanghai for five years since the age of 17. She has heard that the defendant intends to forcibly marry her, so she has come to court to request permission to dissolve the marriage. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Zhang opened a court session to examine the case. The plaintiff, Zhu Xiao Lanzi, stated that she was 22 years old, from Gaoyou, and had parents at home. She stated, "I didn't know about the betrothal until now. I only learned that my parents had betrothed me to the defendant, but I do not agree to this marriage." (Question) "Do you know the defendant?" (Answer) "I don't know him. I returned home from Shanghai last May and declared to my mother that I was unwilling." The judge said, "If you were unwilling, why didn't you file a lawsuit at that time?" (Answer) "I didn't know how to file a lawsuit at that time." The judge ordered the defendant to take the stand. The defendant stated that he was 24 years old and that he had betrothed the plaintiff in the fifth month of the 14th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the plaintiff was still at home and should have known. He also stated that the plaintiff's father was waiting outside the door for instructions. The judge then ordered the plaintiff's father, Zhu Zhaoxing, to be brought to the stand. He stated that he was 43 years old and farmed in his hometown. (Question) "When did Xiao Lanzi come to Shanghai?" (Answer) "She only came to Shanghai last June." (Question) "Has she been here before?" (Answer) "She came to Shanghai once before in the 17th year of the Republic of China. She had never been here before." (Question) "Was your daughter willing when she was betrothed?" (Answer) "My daughter was also willing. Moreover, we are old relatives. But a daughter cannot marry two husbands." (Question) "Do you know about your daughter's lawsuit this time?" (Answer) "I don't know. I just came to Shanghai today." After obtaining the statements, the judge advised the plaintiff not to dissolve the marriage. However, Xiao Lanzi claimed, "I don't want to marry him. I must choose my own marriage." Her father, Zhu Zhaoxing, who was listening nearby, immediately scolded his daughter, saying, "You beast, I raised you to be so big, and you want to make your own decisions. Is there any reason in the world?" The judge then advised both parties to go outside and reconcile. If a reconciliation could not be reached, the case would be reconvened and a judgment would be made according to law. After leaving the court, the defendant's father grabbed his daughter and pushed her into a rickshaw, heading south.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tang Yang's Husband is Available to Everyone</p>
<p>▲ Discovered Inside Room 13 of the Laian Hotel</p>
<p>Mrs. Tang Yang, a 24-year-old woman from Hangzhou, is quite beautiful. Her husband, Tang Cailin, lives outside Qingbomen in Hangzhou and makes a living by growing vegetables. The relationship between the couple is not harmonious. In recent years, Mrs. Tang has been learning to be fashionable and dislikes her husband's rudeness. She wants to find a good husband, so she entrusted someone to recommend her to the silk reeling department of the Jiaxing Weicheng Company as a silk reeling worker. Before long, she fell in love with a soldier named Yang. Yang's appearance and temperament are far superior to her husband, so she wants to live together for a long time. Fearing that the affair would be exposed, Mrs. Tang and her lover Yang agreed to live in Shanghai. Mrs. Tang first took a train to Shanghai, and Yang agreed to come the next morning and meet at the North Station. After Mrs. Tang arrived in Shanghai, she waited at the station the next morning as agreed. Unexpectedly, her lover broke the agreement. From morning to night, she did not see him arrive in Shanghai. Mrs. Tang had no choice but to say that she had something to do in Shanghai and stayed with her husband's elder brother, Tang Zhaolin, for one night. The next day, she went to the station to wait again, eagerly hoping, but Yang did not come for a long time. Mrs. Tang wandered around the station, craning her neck to look every time a train arrived, sometimes talking to herself, looking like she was waiting for her lover. At that time, Li Hongfa (29 years old) from Hunan was looking around, saw Mrs. Tang's situation, and came forward to ask her kindly. Sure enough, she was waiting for her lover. Li recommended himself, saying that his wife had died of illness and he lacked someone to take care of his household, so he wanted to find a suitable person to continue the marriage. He seduced her in every way. Mrs. Tang thought that Yang was ungrateful and broke the agreement. She was in a foreign land and did not know what to do. Seeing that Li's appearance was not bad and that he had no wife, she thought that he could be a long-term husband. So she went to a nearby hotel with him, swore oaths of love, and had illicit relations for seven days and nights. Li was a licentious man and his finances were insufficient, and he gradually became embarrassed. Since Mrs. Tang was originally a female worker, they agreed that Mrs. Tang would enter the Eternal 永 Spinning Factory and be a wonderful female worker. However, Mrs. Tang could not endure the hardship. After working for seven days, she returned to Shanghai with Li and entered the Laian Hotel at the North Station, opening room 13. In the evening, Wu Xin, a patrol officer from the first division of the fourth district, led police officer Liu Haishan to the hotel for inspection. Seeing that Li and Mrs. Tang did not look like a formal couple, they questioned them and their speech was evasive. They were taken to the division station. According to Mrs. Yang's statement, she was cohabiting with Li Hongfa. While the investigation was underway, Tang Zhaolin heard the news and reported to the division that Li had seduced his sister-in-law, requesting an investigation. The division chief, Ni Wenbiao, thought that the case was complicated and ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Who is the Adulterer?</p>
<p>▲ Jointly Escorted to the Local Court for Trial</p>
<p>Chen Fangshi, the daughter of Fang Xincai from Nanxing Bridge, Zhejiang, who lives in the Xiaocaichang of Zhabei, has a husband, Chen Huangpang, who farms in his hometown. Chen came to Shanghai to work last July. Yesterday morning, Fang Xincai and his fellow villager Shen Sanxing, etc., planned to send Chen Fangshi to Nanxing Bridge and had already purchased tickets. However, Chen Xiaosanzi, who runs a carpenter shop in the Xie Xingli of Baoxing Road, gathered people to rob Chen Fangshi. The disturbance was too great, and the police arrested everyone and took them to the police station. According to Fang Xincai's statement, his daughter had an affair with Chen Xiaosanzi and wanted to escape, so he entrusted his friend Shen Sanxing to help him find her and planned to send her to her husband's house. However, Chen Xiaosanzi came to snatch her again. Chen Fangshi claimed that she had no illicit relations with Chen Xiaosanzi. She was found by Shen Sanxing under the false pretenses of her father's orders. After Shen Sanxing raped her, he instigated her father to sell her. Chen Xiaosanzi came to ask her for money, not to snatch her. Chen Xiaosanzi and Shen Sanxing both stated that they did not have an affair with Chen Fangshi. The authorities could not determine who was the adulterer between Chen and Shen, so they transferred both parties to the Local Court for investigation.</p>
<p>Breach of Promise or Seduction?</p>
<p>▲ Conflicting Statements in Marriage Dispute</p>
<p>Zhou Asi, a 20-year-old woman from Dongtai with some beauty, was recently seduced by her fellow villager Zhu Ronggou (32 years old) and hidden in the Fifteen Rooms area of ​​Pudong. The night before, Asi's elder brother, Zhou Haibo, found out, called his relatives and friends Wu Changqing, and twisted Zhu and Asi to the Third District Public Security Bureau. According to Zhou Haibo, he is 21 years old, lives in Hongkou, and works as a soap factory worker. His younger sister Asi had been betrothed to a man surnamed Liu in her hometown with the consent of her parents, but she had not yet married. Unexpectedly, this year she was abducted to Shanghai by Zhu Chonggou, who forcibly occupied her as his wife. Now, the man surnamed Liu and her parents want her back, and there are lawsuits at home, which has caused her parents to be imprisoned and not yet released. Therefore, he came to the Fifteen Rooms area of ​​Pudong and twisted Zhu and his younger sister to the district police station for investigation. Zhu Ronggou stated that Zhou's younger sister Asi was promised to him by her parents, but they later disliked him for being poor and promised her to a man surnamed Liu. In March of this year, he reasoned with his parents-in-law, and they agreed to hand Asi over to him to take to Shanghai for marriage. It was not an abduction. Zhou Asi's statement was roughly the same as Zhu Ronggou's. The district chief thought that the case was related to a marriage dispute and sentenced it to the Local Court for disposal in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Cause of Death of a Woman Unknown</p>
<p>Dong A'gen, a Cantonese cook on a ship traveling to Swatow on Shanghai Road, lives at 98 Gongping Road. His wife, Li, is addicted to gambling and has accumulated a lot of debt. A'gen returned home the day before yesterday and, after learning about the situation, argued with her. She then went upstairs, and A'gen also went out. Soon after, the second landlord, Chen Song, went upstairs and saw that her face had changed drastically, as if she had taken poison. She reported it to the Hongkou police station and ordered the detectives to send her to the hospital for treatment. She died not long after. The police sent the body to the forensic center on Philand Road. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo to examine the body at the forensic center. Chen Song stated that she did not know the cause of death. However, she saw her vomit a lot of black liquid at the time and did not know if she had taken opium. There was no opium box or smoking equipment in her room. According to the sister of the deceased, Chen Li, who also arrived at the scene, there was nothing that could prove the cause of death. Prosecutor Guo then issued a written order stating that the cause of death of the deceased woman Dong Li was unknown and should be examined by the court police and the hospital doctor of the Bureau of Public Works. The case was adjourned to next Monday for further questioning.</p>
<p>Husband Has a New Love, Wife Attempts Suicide</p>
<p>▲ Entrusts Neighbor to Take Good Care of Her Child</p>
<p>▲ Overdose of Poison, Life in Danger</p>
<p>Zhao A'liu, a Cantonese man in his late thirties who lives upstairs in a semi-finished clothing store at 39 Miller Road in Hongkou, has been working at the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant in Gaochang Temple in this city. Twenty years ago, he married a woman surnamed Huang from his hometown, who is now 37 years old. They have only one son, named A'si, who is 20 years old. Last year, Zhao had an affair with a woman outside, and their relationship was very close, which caused him not to return home often. Later, his wife found out and repeatedly quarreled with Zhao. The day before yesterday (the 17th), another dispute broke out, followed by violence. The neighbors came out to mediate, and the matter was settled. That night, Zhao went out and did not return. His wife was depressed and, the night before last (the 18th) at 9 o'clock, secretly swallowed opium paste to commit suicide. She also told the neighbor that A'si, the child, should be taken care of at any time. It was not until yesterday morning that someone noticed it and immediately sent her to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to the long-term overdose, her life is in danger.</p>
<p>Love Story of a Farm Girl and a Factory Worker</p>
<p>▲ Secret Pregnancy and Escape</p>
<p>▲ Parents Retrieve Her and Return to West Hongqiao Road</p>
<p>According to reports, Cuizhen, a peasant girl from the outskirts of the city, had been promised to a man surnamed Chen by her parents since she was a child. However, Cuizhen was very young and beautiful. Last spring, she was seduced by Lu 富, a Zhoujiaqiao man recruited to the nearby Maibian Flower Garden as a factory worker (who usually has his meals at the Dai's house). They had illicit relations more than once. Recently, she became secretly pregnant, and her belly gradually swelled. So Lu富 wanted her to abscond with money at the beginning of last month and live in Guangfu Road, Zhabei. Her father found out and reported it to the police station, who went to arrest her. However, Lu was no longer there, so he took Cuizhen back to her hometown. It is now heard that the man surnamed Chen has written a petition requesting the court to investigate.</p>

<p>The woman Chen Heying, namely Xu Chen, hired a lawyer to file a complaint in the French court, stating that the plaintiff had previously married the defendant Xu Zuqing. They were initially on good terms after the marriage. Unexpectedly, the defendant had recently changed his behavior, abused the plaintiff for no reason, and neglected to provide support. She requested that he be summoned to court to recover the support payments. The judge approved the request, but the defendant failed to appear. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the defendant intentionally refused to appear and requested that the case be brought up for investigation. The judge ordered the plaintiff to summon the defendant to court again for questioning.</p>
<p>Unidentified Man Dies Under a Car</p>
<p>▲ The Chauffeur Found Not at Fault</p>
<p>The chauffeur Zhou A'san was driving car number 12098 at 7 o'clock the night before last. While passing near the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chekiang Road from west to east, a man was crossing Chekiang Road from south to north and collided with the car. The man was knocked down. After the car stopped, he was rescued and taken to the hospital, but he was too severely injured to be saved. He died not long after. After receiving the report, the police sent detectives to transport the body to the forensic center on Philand Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Local Court examined the body at the center. The West Police Chief reported that the chauffeur was not at fault in the incident. After questioning Zhou A'san, Prosecutor Guo ordered the corpse to be claimed and buried by the Pushan Cemetery since the deceased had no family members.</p>
<p>Forensic Examination of a Young Man's Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>A young man came to the Oriental Hotel on Hankow Road on the night of the 17th to stay. Unexpectedly, he committed suicide by poisoning and died. It has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. After receiving a report from the hotel, the Lao Zha Police Station sent detectives to investigate and confirmed that the deceased was named Wu Juqing, from Ningbo. His father, Wu Jinyuan, and his cousin, Li Houkang, are in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, they were summoned to the forensic center on Philand Road. Then, Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Local Court examined the body at the center. Wu Jinyuan stated that his son Juqing was stubborn by nature. Two years ago, he wanted to join the army, but he was prevented by his father. As for why he committed suicide now, he did not know the reason. Li Houkang stated that his cousin Juqing had previously sent him a letter saying that he was suffering from environmental and economic pressures and was going to drown himself to seek peace. As for why he committed suicide now, he did not know. Prosecutor Guo then ordered that Wu Juqing had committed suicide by taking opium before his death. The corpse was handed over to his father, Wu Jinyuan, for burial.</p>
<p>Accomplices in Kidnapping Case Adjourned for Further Questioning</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongshan Police Station previously arrested seven people, Wu Youxin, Zhang Zhide, Jin Rong𨜮, Chen Xiangyin, Chuan Yude, Cao Guangting, Jiang Zengbao, and 姜, in the Bund and French Concession of Nanjing Road, who were related to kidnapping and robbery cases. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court, and Judge Ge brought them to trial. The police lawyer Chen Mingwu, etc., were accomplices of the kidnapper Song Zhenmo (namely Song Xiaoliuzi) who was arrested a few days ago. He requested a postponement and joint trial with Song, etc. Judge Ge approved the request and ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>
<p>Sun Xunqiu's Inheritance Lawsuit</p>
<p>▲ Judge Advised to Consider the Brotherhood</p>
<p>▲ Hoping that Both Parties Would Settle Amicably</p>
<p>Hu Sun Jinghua, the married daughter of the late wealthy merchant Sun Xunqiu, and her brothers Sun Zhongwei and Zhongyao, etc., were involved in a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court over the possession of inheritance. It was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Yi opened a court session to continue the trial. Song Mingdong, the lawyer representing the plaintiff, stated the facts of the case, saying that Sun Xunqiu passed away in January of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and his inheritance was divided by the defendants in March of that year, as evidenced by a draft agreement. The plaintiff now requests a re-division based on the provision that married daughters have the right to inherit the estate. In the defendant's defense statement, it was stated that most of Xunqiu's inheritance was divided as early as the 14th year, which is not true. The draft agreement presented in the case is a method of pre-distribution and cannot prove that it has been divided. The traceability clause clearly states that it should be based on the commencement of inheritance, and the commencement of inheritance should be calculated from the date of death of the deceased. The analysis cannot be used as a synonym for inheritance. The analysis and inheritance are two different things. Even if the analysis is in the past, the commencement of inheritance is always after the new interpretation takes effect. Therefore, the plaintiff's claim to re-analyze is in accordance with the law. Yuan Hanyun, the lawyer representing the defendant, then rebutted the plaintiff's lawyer's statements one by one and presented various evidences to prove that Xunqiu's inheritance was indeed divided in the 14th year. At that time, the resolution on women inheriting inheritance had not taken effect in Jiangsu Province, and the plaintiff had no right to claim it. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. Judge Yang then questioned the defendants and advised both parties to consider the brotherhood and resolve the matter peacefully to avoid hurting feelings. The case was adjourned, and if the two parties could not reach a settlement, it would be investigated further.</p>
<p>Father and Son Quarrel, Mistaken for a Burglary</p>
<p>▲ Police Officers Went with Guns</p>
<p>▲ The Neighbors Were Very Disturbed</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 12 o'clock, a police whistle was heard in the Heng'anfang 17 of Dade Lane on North Szechuan Road, along with shouts of "Catch the robbers!" The police officers on duty at the second station of the fifth district thought it was a robbery and went with their guns. The scene was noisy and disorderly. They immediately pushed the</p>

<p>Tomorrow's General Assembly to Have Hu Zhantang Speak  Tomorrow's General Assembly to Have Hu Zhantang Speak, the 21st General Assembly, Minister Jiang has urged Mr. Hu Zhantang to attend and give a speech. The Education Funding Group will convene meetings starting tomorrow. The Education Funding Group Review Committee has been nominated with one person from each group, including Chen Dezheng (Teacher Training Group), Chen Hexian (Adult Continuing Education Group), Zheng Hongnian (Overseas Chinese Education Group), Xu Shouzhi (Elementary Education Group), Zhang Honglie (Compulsory Education Group), Chen Bulei (Secondary Education Group), and Hu Shuhua (Higher Education Group). The meeting is scheduled to be held at the Ministry of Education at 9:00 AM on the 21st. Li Quanshi's Important Remarks on Education Funding ▲ Central and Local Governments Should Increase Funding ▲ There are Three Measures in Total The review committees of all groups of the National Education Conference have convened meetings for review one after another, except for the Education Funding Group, which has not yet begun its review. Funding is the mother of fact; if the funding issue cannot be resolved, the proposals of each group will become empty talk on paper. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired about this matter from the expert member of the Education Funding Committee, Dr. Li Quanshi. According to him, there is indeed a solution to the entire funding issue for improving the national education plan. The date for the Education Funding Review Group's meeting will be after each group has completed its review, and one representative will be selected from each group to participate in the discussion. Therefore, the parts of each group's review report concerning funding will be reserved for the Education Funding Review Group to review in the future before being submitted to the General Assembly for approval. The following are the central and local governments' annual increases in education funding (approximate figures in millions of yuan) after the national education improvement plan is passed, as discussed by Mr. Li: Year Central Province County/City 1st 30 6 26 2nd 37 17 32 3rd 52 16 54 4th 58 18 62 5th 65 19 69 6th 79 23 84 7th 89 25 94 8th 98 27 105 9th 108 29 115 10th 117 31 126 11th 140 33 136 12th 35 147 13th 146 37 157 14th 156 40 167 15th 166 42 177 16th 175 44 188 17th 185 46 199 18th 194 48 109 19th 204 50 220 20th 213 52 230 As for the methods of increasing education funding, the central government can rectify or increase the following taxes: (A) Ability tax (including income tax and inheritance tax), (B) Benefit tax, indirect consumption tax, reform of salt tax, | tax collection at the market; the provincial government can increase benefit tax, business tax; the county and city can increase ability tax, income tax surcharge, central inheritance tax subsidies, (C) Benefit tax, direct consumption tax, banquet tax. The Nationality Issue of Establishing Elementary Schools and Kindergartens ▲ In the preliminary review, Article 6 under the establishment section was removed | Vigorous discussion tomorrow | At the fourth general meeting, the preliminary review committee decided to remove Article 6 under the establishment section of the plan to improve elementary education: "Groups organized by non-Chinese people or not entirely by Chinese people shall not be allowed to establish elementary schools and kindergartens. Teachers and staff of elementary schools and kindergartens shall be limited to people who are completely citizens of the Republic of China." This will lead to a fierce debate. Some members said that the review committee is based on the principle of promoting compulsory education and advocates deletion, while the opposition stands on the party's position, based on the educational goals of the Republic of China, promoting national spirit, and resisting cultural aggression, advocating maintaining the original proposal of the Ministry of Education. It is still known that basic education should be run by Chinese people themselves. Everyone knows that the basic education of a country should be handled by its own people. This is a matter of course. Educational policy, needless to say, we Chinese people formulate education plans for Chinese people, and solemnly declare that elementary schools and kindergartens should be run by Chinese people. It has already followed the same path as the saying "there are no foreign three hundred taels of silver inside the house," revealing our weakness and showing that the education of us Chinese people is mostly contracted by foreigners. But it is barely satisfactory. Everyone still thinks that foreign-run schools in China should be taken back. Therefore, a provision was specifically made that groups not organized by citizens of the Republic of China or not entirely by citizens of the Republic of China shall not be allowed to establish elementary schools and kindergartens. Who knows that the review committee deleted this provision? I personally think that it is either because there is no money to take back these many foreign-run schools, or it is feared that the implementation of compulsory education will be hindered. If it is for the former, then there is no need to set out the limit for the realization of compulsory education; if it is for the latter, then it can be easily solved. Isn't it possible to first recover these many foreign-established schools by preparing the first phase of compulsory education funding? In short, setting out the principle that Chinese people should run schools for Chinese people in the plan is already a low standard. After it has been set out, it is still reviewed and deleted, especially leading to a dead end, making people puzzled, and doing something unnecessary. I don’t know what many problems will arise. The most important one is the issue of national independence and the policy of cultural aggression. I deeply hope that all representatives will pay more attention to this basic education product related to the survival of the nation and promote overseas Chinese education. ▲ Zhuang Zexuan, Zheng Hongnian and others proposed a case to request the government to support the development of overseas Chinese funding to promote overseas Chinese education. Zhuang Zexuan and others proposed a case to request the government to support the development of overseas Chinese funding to promote overseas Chinese education. (Reasons) 1. According to a survey in previous years, overseas Chinese remit more than 10,000,000 yuan back to their motherland every year. In recent years, due to fierce commercial competition, the economic situation has plummeted. If measures are not taken to help them as soon as possible, not only will the 10,000,000 overseas Chinese have no place to stand overseas, but also the domestic economy will inevitably suffer a major blow. 2. Overseas Chinese are extremely enthusiastic about supporting revolutionary work, and the funds they have contributed are also considerable. When drinking water, one should think of its source. Today's government has an obligation to support the economic development of overseas Chinese. 3. In education, Xiamen University, Jimei School, etc., which were independently established and operated by overseas Chinese, are unable to maintain due to economic difficulties. Overseas Chinese education funds in the Philippines have always relied solely on business surcharges, and various schools have used this to develop. The Central Executive Committee has recognized this as a good method. Please ask overseas Chinese in various places to follow suit. Recently, due to business failures, it is impossible to implement this method that was not originally created. These two matters can prove that if the government does not take measures to support the economic development of overseas Chinese as soon as possible, the future of overseas Chinese education will be unimaginable. (Measures) 1. Please ask the National Government to issue an order to all customs offices to exempt overseas Chinese manufactured products from import and transit taxes. 2. Please ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to implement the selection and dispatch of commissioners as soon as possible to be stationed or travel to various places to assist overseas Chinese in developing industry and commerce. 3. Please ask the Ministry of Education to designate various universities related to overseas Chinese education to train overseas Chinese affairs cadres. 4. Please ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be responsible for handling any foreign affairs related to overseas Chinese education quickly and properly. Proponents: Zhuang Zexuan, Zheng Hongnian, Ou Yuanhuai, Chen Dezheng, Zhao Bangfu, Qian He, Zhu Baoqin, Liu Shimu, Lei Peihong, Jin Zengcheng, Chen Bulei, etc. The proposal was approved to be submitted for discussion first. ▲ Political Conference Responds to the Ministry of Education The Central Executive Committee's Political Conference sent a letter to the Ministry of Education on the 18th, stating that the submitted education plan and general budget have been reviewed by the conference and are generally consistent with the party's platform and the resolutions on education at previous meetings, and can be submitted for discussion first. It is hoped that the National Education Conference will be notified for reference. The original letter from the Political Conference of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang is excerpted as follows: The report stated that in accordance with the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee, the Education Plan Compilation Committee was organized to draft various plans. The two plans of compulsory education and adult continuing education have been submitted to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the National Government for review. Except for the plan on Party Ideology education, which will be submitted separately after the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Education Group of the Central Training, Zheng Hongnian, and the special commissioner for Party Ideology education of the department complete the compilation, the remaining eight cases such as the preliminary education plan, the secondary education plan, the higher education plan, the social education plan, the plan to set up teacher training institutions, the overseas Chinese education plan, the Mongolian and Tibetan education plan, and the general budget have been completed. In addition to submitting to the Executive Yuan to forward to the National Government for record, the entire education plan and budget will be submitted for approval. Attached is a copy of the printed "Improving the National Education Plan," including ten chapters such as the Preliminary Plan for Implementing Compulsory Education and the Preliminary Plan for Implementing Adult Continuing Education. At the same time, a letter from the National Government stated that the Executive Yuan submitted a plan for the education plan and a general budget submitted by the Ministry of Education in accordance with the resolution of the Central Plenary Session. The case is requested for review. In addition to the original documents that have been submitted by the Ministry of Education and will not be sent separately, a copy of the original report is sent to you for reference. The entire case has now been reviewed by the conference and is considered to be generally consistent with the party's platform and the resolutions on education at previous meetings, and can be submitted for discussion first. In addition to replying to the National Government, a corresponding letter is hereby sent, hoping that you will check and forward it to the National Education Conference for reference. Sincerely, Political Conference of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Hou Hongjian, Representative of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, Talks ▲ The Arrest of Cheng Bai-Lu, Education, and Its Impact Hou Hongjian, representative of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, arrived in Beijing on the 19th morning to attend the meeting and had the following conversation with reporters. The reporter asked: 1. What is the situation after Cheng Bai-Lu was arrested? Hou replied: After Director Cheng was arrested in Fujian, he was initially treated favorably in Yan, but then he was returned to the province and detained in the Hongshanqiao Arsenal. With the arrival of the 56th Division in the province, he was sent to northern Fujian for the second time, and he went deeper into the mountains, reaching Youxi. Youxi is where the Lu Division is stationed. The name is favorable treatment, but the living conditions are far worse than before. Question 2. What is the state of education in Fujian Province after Cheng was arrested? Answer: Education in Fujian Province was originally in its infancy, and the education funding was insufficient, only more than 1.4 million yuan per year. In the past three months, the Salt Affairs Inspection Office has only handed over a maximum of more than 70,000 yuan per month to the Education Funding Management Office, causing Secretary Hou to do his best to maintain it and deal with subsidies to schools inside and outside the province and counties. As of now, each is owed one or two months. The cost of studying in the East and West Oceans is owed for up to six months. Without rice to cook, Chen Peikun, director of the Management Office, resigned, and the entire education community in the province is helping. Whether the schools can continue to operate after this is still unknown until the summer vacation. Question 3. What is the impact after the arrest? Answer: After the five provincial committee members and the Water Police Bureau were arrested, the heads and supervisors of education bureaus in various counties were subjected to school closures and beatings at various schools, which is endless. The so-called "what the superiors do, the subordinates follow" and the mutual contention for power make education impossible to speak of. The finances cannot be collected, and there is no way to obtain education funds. Administrative expenses are owed for two or three months. What can be said about chaos and profit? Various General Assembly ▲ Guanghua Photography Provides Free Photography The entire collection of photos from this National Education Conference will be taken by the Guanghua Photography Studio in Nanjing, which will also voluntarily take half-length four-inch photos of all members for future compilation into a report on the entire conference. Yesterday, they also took film footage of the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons and all members in an indoor meeting format. ▲ Reception Arrangements for Schools in the Capital City The municipal schools in the capital city will hold a tea party for the representatives at Wuzhou Park at 2:00 PM on the 20th. Teachers from the Lufei Lane Kindergarten, the Central District Experimental School, and the Shengping Bridge Elementary School will wear badges to attend the meeting. ▲ National Language of Education Among the 101 members, whose hometowns are all over the provinces, many do not use local dialects when they stand up and speak, but use Mandarin instead. However, members who usually lack practice in Mandarin often reveal local dialects when speaking, and sometimes add one or two English names. This kind of Mandarin is often heard at the conference, which cannot be named anything but the "National Language of Education". ▲ The Clever Decoration of Three Colors There are three female members at this conference. At the third conference, the three members each wore cheongsams, one green, one black, and one red, which was a clever decoration of these three colors among the members' seats. ▲ Start Compiling the Conference Report The Preparatory Committee of the Second National Education Conference plans to compile the proceedings of the conference into a volume after the conference is over as the report of the Second National Education Conference, and attach photos of each member. The reception section is now collecting four-inch half-length photos of each member in preparation for starting the compilation. ▲ The Jiangsu Righteous Education Office Sends Publications The Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province has made many contributions to the vigorous implementation of righteous education. As the Second National Education Conference is being held in Nanjing, the office specially selected the recently published righteous education publications and statistical charts, such as the Work Report of the Righteous Education Office for the Past Year, the Compilation of Compulsory Education, the Essentials of Compulsory Education in the World, Compulsory Education in Japan, Compulsory Education in New York, and the Statistical Table of the General Situation of Compulsory Education in Various Counties of Jiangsu (which includes the number of schools, the number of teachers, the number of children, the number of classes, and the amount of funding, which is very detailed), the Statistical Table of Elementary School Teachers in Various Counties of Jiangsu, and the Education Center Rural Transformation Map, etc., a total of five types of books and three types of charts, and specially sent commissioners to pack them into two boxes, totaling 150 copies, to the conference for distribution. After receiving them, the members praised them and said that it is most important to conduct this kind of investigation and research in order to popularize compulsory education in China. Otherwise, the promotion of compulsory education will lose its basis, and it will be even more difficult to check the efficiency of the progress. It is also heard that the office had previously issued long-term observer tickets to the National Education Conference, welcoming the office to send personnel to observe, and the office also provided relevant review groups of the National Education Conference with reference to major issues such as teacher training and compulsory education liaison. ▲ The World Book Company Sends Personnel to Provide Hospitality The Shanghai World Book Company, in order to treat the members attending the National Education Conference with courtesy, specially sent Shen Siqi, the chief of the public relations section of the General Affairs Department, to Beijing, staying at the Central Hotel, and greeted them at the Railway Department's conference venue every day. On the 17th, he also presented each member with a copy of "Baiwu Wenhua" written by Liu Dabai, the vice minister of the Ministry of Education, as a souvenir. ▲ Guests Who Attended the Meeting Yesterday Guests who attended the meeting included Jiang Yuanmin, Li Weijia, Xie Shouya, Chen Panzao, Zhao Yuren, Wu Yifang, Song Zhonghong, Zhu Shouxi, Qiu Jingni, Wu Qiyun, Xu Jianyuan, Miao Qiusheng, etc., and reporters from various newspapers, totaling 32 people. Girl Scouts Boil Rice in Pots Members Return Laden with Books Various agencies and libraries in Beijing sent personnel to distribute publications at the conference, and members each carried these books when they boarded the car to return to their residences, returning fully loaded. Detailed Account of the Examination Yuan's Banquet ▲ Dai Jitao and Cai Yuanpei Both Gave Speeches ▲ Members Publicly Elected Jin Zengcheng to Deliver a Reply On the evening of the 18th, at 7:30, the Examination Yuan hosted a banquet for the members of the National Education Conference, which was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The details are now recorded below. More than a hundred people, including Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, and Jiang Menglin, attended that evening, and were received by Dai Jitao, Shao Yuanchong, Zhang Mojun, etc. At about 8:00, they entered the seats. At the end of the banquet, Dai stood up and gave a speech, saying roughly that today the Examination Yuan is holding a banquet for all representatives and experts. We are very happy to have you all here. In the past few decades, the political employment and administration in our country have lacked standards, so politics has become increasingly bleak. The task of the Examination Yuan is to remedy this shortcoming. Judging from the current situation in China, the implementation of examinations is truly urgent. Moreover, examinations are one of the important proposals of Mr. Sun Yat-sen during his lifetime. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's most important remarks on examinations are the three words: "Cultivate properly, encourage properly, and employ appropriately." The work of political testing and appointment focuses on the second and third sentences, while the work of the first sentence is the responsibility of the education sector. After all, the government's employment and administration are not successful without relying on examination work, but if you want the examination to obtain appropriate talents, then you must rely on the education sector. At present, in the political field, from the central government to local autonomy, there is a feeling of a lack of talent, especially in local autonomy. In each village, it is impossible to find literate people, so the government's orders cannot be directly communicated to the people everywhere. Even if the government has the most complete policies, it is equivalent to setting up a shell. In the future, all civil servants in all provinces and counties must pass the examination. If education is not properly conducted, then there will be no appropriate talents to take the examination. From now on, if you want to seek progress in all aspects of politics and society, you must rely on good education, and if you want to seek progress in education, you must have a systematic and comprehensive plan. Although the resolutions of the First National Education Conference were also excellent and complete, the shortcoming was that the opinions of all parties were lost in the resolutions. Therefore, when implemented, there were disadvantages of not knowing what to do. This time, the proposal was formulated by the central government with a concrete plan in advance, and then the opinions of various experts and representatives were collected. It is expected that there will be more satisfactory results. Today, I would like to briefly state my views on the tasks of the Examination Yuan to all educators. As for the hospitality, because it was sudden, there were many inadequacies, please forgive me. The members publicly elected Jin Zengcheng to deliver a reply, saying roughly that Mr. Dai is an advanced educator, and his remarks and contributions to education have been extensively reported in domestic newspapers and magazines. The education community has long admired him in their hearts. Today, my colleagues and others have the honor to hear his teachings, which is a great honor. In the future, if there is an opportunity, please ask Mr. Dai to come to the conference and give a speech. I would like to toast Mr. Dai this glass of wine and offer a cup to Mr. Dai. Mr. Cai Yuanpei's speech: Just now Mr. Dai spoke to all the members from the standpoint of the Examination Yuan. I greatly admire him. The goal of education The Second Day of the National Boy Scout General Review Yesterday the Rain Moved the Camp · · Performance Temporarily Suspended Moving the Camp Due to Rain The camping period was originally scheduled from the 16th to the 21st. Due to the previous rain, it was not until the 17th that camping could be carried out. Unexpectedly, this morning (19th) at 2 o'clock, there was a sudden heavy rain, which caused water to accumulate in the camp and the tents were all wet. It was necessary to move back to the original site of the Military Officer Research Class for camping. Yesterday the Performance Was Suspended The schedule for this Boy Scout review was originally scheduled to hold various performances today. Due to the heavy rain this morning, the small camp was extremely muddy, which was not convenient for performance. The office temporarily issued a notice to temporarily suspend the performance. Review Results According to the Central News Agency, the results of the general review showed that Committee Member Jiang and Committee Member Dai were very impressed with the solemn military appearance, agile movements, and orderly steps of the 98th Regiment, the 121st Regiment, the 39th Regiment, the 129th Regiment, the 50th Regiment, the 88th Regiment, the 175th Regiment, the 58th Regiment, the 109th Regiment, and the 122nd Regiment. Chairman Jiang Sends Condolences Chairman Jiang took pity that at 2:00 or 3:00 on the evening of the 18th, the weather was not good, and there was a sudden heavy rain. Thousands of Boy Scouts were camping in the camp. Fearing that there would be unfortunate events and that the camp relocation and other matters were not well taken care of, he took a car to the office of this general review in the Military Officer Research Class behind the National Government at 9:00 AM yesterday to inquire about everything. Shi Weihuan, the director of the office, reported the situation of the Boy Scouts after the heavy rain the night before, the relocation of the camp yesterday morning, and the future handling plan. Chairman Jiang gave instructions one by one, and then inspected the Boy Scout residences, sending condolences to the Boy Scouts one by one. He said to the Boy Scouts, "Are you tired? Are your clothes all wet? Are you sick? Rest well. Tonight at 7:00, I will invite you to watch a film about the European War at the Military Academy's Encouragement Society." He sent his sincere condolences, and his love was so kind. He also notified the office to inform all regiments, and ordered the Guard Brigade to help the Boy Scouts move the camp and all the supplies, and instructed the recruits of the military academy to assist Ling Guangya in handling the sanitary and cleaning matters of the Boy Scouts' kitchens and toilets, so as not to make the Boy Scouts feel a little difficulty. He made a tour of the Boy Scout residences. Seeing this group of young children, each with bare feet, muddy heads, and dirty faces, and the spirit of cleverness and vitality, courage, and endurance, he expressed great satisfaction that they were a model for China's new youth. After about an hour, he returned by car. Dai Jitao Sends Condolences ▲ And Prepares to Present Sun Yat-sen's Portrait as a Memorial Dai Jitao went to the Boy Scout camp at 8:00 on the morning of the 19th. The water had accumulated into a swamp, and the ground was muddy. He made a tour of the camp and sent his sincere condolences to the Boy Scouts. Jitao telegraphed Zhu Jiahua in Hangzhou, asking him to make another 4,500 copies of Sun Yat-sen's portrait woven with silk, and sent a special commissioner to Beijing to distribute them to the participating Boy Scouts as a souvenir. The Second General Review Next Autumn ▲ Shi Weihuan Discusses the Results with Mr. Dai Jitao ▲ To Be Held at the Same Time as the Second National Games Shi Weihuan, the director of the review office, discussed the second general review with Dai Jitao on the 19th. It is proposed to hold it at the same time or before and after the Second National Games next autumn. If it can be realized, the cost will be between 60,000 and 100,000 yuan, which will exceed the cost of this time. The pre-arrangement and reception will be better than this time, and it is also planned to invite more Boy Scout service members from various places to prepare, in order to be perfect. Shantou Boy Scouts Arrive The 73rd Regiment directly under the Boy Scout Headquarters, that is, the Shantou Youlian, is cultivating talents. Whether the talents cultivated in schools can be used by society depends on the Examination Yuan. The Examination Yuan has the function of selecting talents created by educational institutions. The educational situation in China is slightly different from that of other countries in the world. In Chinese schools, students can always graduate at the end of their years in school. If they are not allowed to graduate, the students will quarrel with the school authorities endlessly. Operators can generally know this. There are many ways to remedy this problem, such as organizing a committee, with teachers from other schools presiding over the examination, etc., but it is not as good as having the Examination Yuan preside over it. Now Japan, Belgium, etc. have implemented it. The examination authority presides over the school examination. It seems that our country can also imitate it. In this way, educational institutions can relax the method of interfering with unofficial schools. Regarding the incident of the First National Education Conference, many members mentioned it in the conference, and Mr. Dai also mentioned it in his speech today. I would like to take this opportunity to meet you all. At that time, before the first conference, Mr. Dai advocated using the method used by Mr. Sun Yat-sen for the First National Congress. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in his opening speech at the National Congress that this time, gathering you all in one hall is not to ask you to submit proposals, but to ask you to find ways to promote the education conference. Mr. Dai vigorously advocated using this method, and together with the Guangdong Education Department in Guangdong prepared a systematic plan. At that time, my brother decided to use the method of free proposals due to the timing. This time, because the period is different from before, the central government formulated the general plan and handed it over to the conference for discussion. The final decision is still up to the central government. Mr. Dai's proposal in the past has now been fully realized. This method is very good, because of the free development of personality, it has been done once before. The advantage of this method is that it can concentrate attention and focus the spirit, which is most convenient and effective for discussion. This is my personal feeling. Last time, Mr. Dai was in Guangdong. This time, Mr. Dai is in the capital. He will definitely give us the opportunity to guide us. The school, due to the delay of the China Merchants Steamship Company's ship, did not arrive in Shanghai until the afternoon of the 14th, and arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 18th, just in time for the start of the general review. It participated on time. It was found that the Guangdong Boy Scout, except for the Guangzhou Boy Scout service personnel, only had one regiment from the school. Although the journey was long and the period was urgent, the Boy Scouts were all in high spirits. Mutual Aid Spirit The rehearsal of the National Boy Scout General Review was completed on the 17th. It was late, and the night was blurred. Therefore, the division of the camp and the erection of tents were all carried out in the dark, which caused one of the 118th Regiment's bedding to be lost. It happened to be seen by Zhang Rongtang, a member of the 148th Regiment (Xianghu Normal School Boy Scout). After finding the original owner, he returned the object. After receiving the lost property, the 118th Regiment was very grateful. If Zhang of the 148th Regiment can take care of himself and others in his busy schedule, not only will he return the lost property without concealing it, but his spirit of mutual assistance is also commendable. The Competition Has Not Been Determined Today The Boy Scout performance was originally scheduled for the afternoon of the 19th. However, it was unable to be held due to rain. Whether the performance will be held according to the scheduled program on the 20th depends on the weather. If it does not rain and the ground is slightly dry, the performance can be held. Jiang, Chairman of the Shen Xiang Sheng Iron Factory's Workers' Children's School, Prepares to Send Gifts ▲ Large Silver Cup · · Photos · · Food, etc. Chairman Jiang has prepared gifts for the Boy Scouts and has delivered them to the Civil Service Office to send to the temporary office, including four large silver cups with the three characters "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" inscribed in the middle, and the inscription "First National General Review and Grand Camp Commemoration of the Chinese Boy Scouts" above, and "Presented by Jiang Zhongzheng as Prizes" below.

<h3 id="e105">A Scene of Shanghai's Sin <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲ Coveting to Obtain a Better Job</p>
<p>▲ Not Hesitating to Sacrifice a Younger Sister</p>
<p>▲ Chen Jinsheng Frauds and Defiles a Young Girl</p>
<p>▲ Such Scoundrels Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>▲ A Maiden of Graceful Bearing. Xu Jinsong, a native of Nanjing, resides at No. 19, Ruichang Lane, Tangjiawan, West Gate, while his family lives outside Fengmen, Suzhou. Xu works in a sock factory. His younger sister, Xu Guibao, is twenty-nine years old, with graceful bearing and awaiting marriage. However, she lacks means of making a living.</p>
<p>▲ Coming to Shanghai to Work as a Hostess. In March of this year, Guibao, being idle at home, came to Shanghai to seek a living. Going to work in a factory requires training and expenses, so her elder sister introduced her to work as a hostess at the New World Company's rooftop garden. However, as a hostess, she had to sell twenty bowls of tea each day to meet the quota. Guibao was not good at socializing and only sold seven or eight bowls a day, leading to her dismissal after six or seven days.</p>
<p>▲ Getting Acquainted with Chen Jinsheng. During these six or seven days, she met a man named Chen Jinsheng at the New World Company. He would visit her place for tea every day, and they gradually started talking. Chen claimed to be an old manager at the Longtou of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, with considerable influence. Guibao thought her elder brother, Xu Jinshan, was currently unemployed, and her second brother, Xu Jinsong's, business was not profitable either. She asked Chen to find them work. Chen readily agreed and inquired about Guibao's address, making an appointment for later.</p>
<p>▲ The Family Fawning on a Valued Guest. After Guibao was dismissed by the New World Company, Chen Jinsheng visited the Xu family in Ruichang Lane. As a result, her family regarded Chen Jinsheng as a valued guest and fawned upon him. Chen promised to recommend them for jobs. After waiting for several days without any news, Guibao's elder brother became impatient and returned to Suzhou. Guibao also planned to leave, but Chen Jinsheng suddenly arrived at this moment.</p>
<p>▲ Claiming Jobs Were Found. He said he had recommended Xu Jinshan for a job in the train's tea room and Xu Jinsong for oiling at the Longtou, both successfully. Xu Jinsong was overjoyed, but since his elder brother had already returned, he lamented the missed opportunity. Ma, Ding Zhengkang, Ding Wenwei, and others living with him also asked Chen Jinsheng to help them secure jobs in the tea room. Chen readily agreed to fill Xu Jinshan's position with Ma.</p>
<p>▲ Guibao Was Defiled. He then told everyone that each person had to pay five yuan to the accounting office, supposedly for buying hot water glasses, which would be more convenient and less prone to breakage than buying their own. Xu and the others deeply believed him, treating him like an ancestor and even urging Guibao not to be shy and to ingratiate herself with the esteemed guest. As a result, Chen Jinsheng brazenly took Guibao out on dates and repeatedly raped her in the railway hotel, without shame, but with a sense of achievement. The power of the living environment is indeed great.</p>
<p>▲ Introducing the General Manager at the North Station. Xu Jinsong, believing that good jobs had been secured, voluntarily quit his job at the sock factory. Guibao repeatedly asked Chen Jinsheng to expedite her brother's introduction. After several days, Chen instructed everyone to make a set of blue cloth clothes. Xu Jinsong was to wear a Zhongshan suit. After dressing up, they accompanied Xu and the others to the third floor of the North Station to meet the general manager. Xu and the others saw the sign "No Entry for Unauthorized Personnel," which increased their trust. However, after going upstairs, Chen glanced around and said that the foreign manager was not present and there was no one to translate, so they should come back another day. Xu and the others happily returned home.</p>
<p>▲ Over Forty Yuan Spent. Chen continued to spend time with Guibao, spending quite lavishly. About three days later, Chen told Xu and the others that each person needed to pay another five yuan as union fees. Xu and the others had no choice but to pawn their belongings and pay. In reality, he had no money for the hotel expenses, so he fabricated excuses to swindle them. In total, they were swindled out of more than forty yuan, and a younger sister was sacrificed for sexual exploitation. However, the benefits of the job had yet to be realized.</p>
<p>▲ Awakening from a Dream. The day before yesterday, Xu and Ma went to the station to look for Chen Jinsheng. Ma had a friend who was a railway police officer. The officer asked Ma about the situation. The officer became suspicious and accompanied them to find Chen. They then discovered that Chen was not a railway employee but an impostor. They asked him what he was doing, and Chen replied that he was just hanging around. The officer slapped him and took him to the police station. Xu Jinsong then felt like he was awakening from a dream. He had been cheated of his money, his sister had been defiled, and he had quit his job at the sock factory. He felt like he could neither live nor die. Therefore, he also went to the police station to seek justice. The police station then summoned Xu Guibao to give a statement, and they were enraged to learn about the seduction and rape. Yesterday, they were all sent to the local court for questioning. The court ordered the defendant Chen Jinsheng to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e106">City Detective Team Solves the Wang Baoshan Assassination Case <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Main Culprit Captured in Sijing</p>
<p>▲ Two Accomplices Still at Large</p>
<p>Wang Baoshan, a native of Funing who resided at No. 13, Lane 72, Xiangyanqiao Road, Outer Hongkou, and operated the Central Printing House and also engaged in the night soil business, was suddenly assassinated by an enemy on the night of February 28th of this year at 9:00 PM. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Although the Fifth District Third Sub-station arrested several suspects and accomplices at the time, the main culprit remained at large. It is now known that the main offender, Wang Ouguang, a native of Yancheng, was arrested by the City Public Security Bureau's Detective Team in Sijing the day before yesterday. The details of the arrest are described below.</p>
<p>▲ Investigating the Main Culprit. This case occurred on February 28th of this year. The Fifth District Third Sub-station arrested the accomplice Dai Ruzhao's wife, Dai Dengshi, his younger brother Dai Runeng, Wang Fugguang's wife, Wang Zhushi, Wang's younger brother Wang Wenxiang, and suspects Shi Fulin and his wife Wang, and witness Shi Zonglin, among others. They were sent to the Judicial Section and then to the local court for questioning. However, the statements of each person were evasive, and the identity of the main culprit remained unknown.</p>
<p>▲ Enmity Arising from Jealousy. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Yuan Liang, attached great importance to this case. On the 14th of last month, he issued Instruction No. 175 (Fa Zi) to all subordinates, ordering them to strictly arrest the main culprit and bring him to justice. After receiving the order, the Detective Team's Deputy Captain Lu immediately secretly ordered the detectives in each squad to solve the case within a limited time. After detailed investigation by the detectives, it was finally revealed that the main culprit in this case was the fugitive Wang Fuguang. This was because Fuguang was also engaged in the night soil business, and enmity arose from jealousy in the business, leading to the motive for murder.</p>
<p>▲ Detaining the Suspects. After Deputy Captain Lu determined that Wang Fuguang was the main offender, he ordered a strict search for him. However, the suspect had already fled in fear of punishment, leaving no trace. Until 10:00 PM on the 12th of this month, Detective Chen Jiren reported that he had detained a suspect named Wang Wangao. He was immediately brought in for questioning. According to Wang's statement, he was fifteen years old and had been carrying night soil at his elder brother Wang Wankui's house. In the third month of the lunar calendar this year, around 8:00 PM in the evening, Wang Fuguang and Dai Ruzhao, whom he knew, came to his brother Wankui's house and secretly discussed the details of the assassination of Wang Baoshan.</p>
<p>▲ Third Master Escaped by Luck. After Fuguang and Dai met with his brother Wankui, the three of them talked secretly. He (Wang Wangao) was not suspected because he and Wankui were brothers. He then heard Fuguang say that eight people had gone to assassinate Mr. (referring to Baoshan), four were outside keeping watch, and four went inside to commit the act. After the deed was done, they went to the house of Third Master (referring to Wang Tingzhang) to assassinate him, but Third Master was out, so they did not encounter him. The rest of the conversation was spoken in a lower voice and was unclear. Finally, he heard Fuguang say that he had now moved to a new house at No. 14, Nanzhuangzi, Wusong. At that time, his brother Wankui did not reply. It was not until 1:00 AM that Fuguang and Dai left, he said.</p>
<p>▲ Revealing the Truth. Wangao also stated that after they left, Wankui told him not to reveal anything, or he would kill him. Until yesterday (the 12th), when he returned home from outside, Wang Tingzhang asked him about it. He told him the truth without concealing anything, he said. According to the statement, Deputy Captain Lu immediately ordered squad leader Qi Haitian to lead detectives Chen Jiren and Xu Rongfu, along with Wang Wangao, to a thatched shed in Gaolangqiao Northeast, Yangshupu, to arrest Wang Wankui. According to his statement, he was forty-two years old, a native of Yancheng. He said that the details of this case would be clear if Wang Peishan was arrested.</p>
<p>▲ Escaping to Sijing. Deputy Captain Lu then ordered the original detectives to take Wankui to a thatched shed near the Wuhua Silk Weaving Factory on Xiangyanqiao Road, Hongkou, to arrest Wang Peishan. According to his statement, he was fifty-nine years old, a native of Yancheng, and worked as a vegetable seller. He also said that the details of the case should be asked of Ling Sanlin. Then, they went to No. 12, Xiangyanqiao Road, Zhabei, across the street from the deceased, to arrest Ling. Ling stated that he was thirty-four years old, worked as a vegetable seller, and was also a native of Yancheng. He said that the main culprit Wang Fuguang had fled to Sijing and could be arrested there. The original detectives then went directly to Sijing and arrested Fuguang, bringing him back for strict questioning.</p>
<p>▲ The Origin of the Murderous Intent. The main culprit Wang Fuguang stated that he was thirty-nine years old, a native of Yancheng, and resided at No. 12, Lane 72, Xiangyanqiao Road, Zhabei, and worked as a night soil carrier. Because the deceased had always operated an old night soil business, he intended to set up a new business, which led to enmity with the deceased. He immediately discussed it with his accomplice Dai Ruzhao. Dai then came up with the idea to assassinate the deceased. On February 28th, around 9:00 PM, he invited five people, including Liu Daguansi, Zhu Zixiang, and Shi Fulin, to bring three pistols to the deceased's house. The deceased was sitting by a round table. Liu Daguansi rushed in first and fired at the deceased with a gun.</p>
<p>▲ A Total of Seven Shots Fired. After Liu fired the first shot, he and Dai also rushed in. Zhu and Shi were keeping watch outside. Liu fired a total of four shots, he fired one shot, and Dai fired two shots, for a total of seven shots. All of them hit the deceased's vital points. They saw the deceased fall to the ground and die. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, they immediately fled in different directions. As for the three pistols, Liu Daguansi brought them to the Hujiamuqiao and distributed them to them. After the deed was done, they returned them to Liu in a deserted area near the Nantong Yangzhou Theater on Tian Tong Road. Dai Ruzhao then opened a room on the second floor of the Dadong Hotel, and Liu went his own way.</p>
<p>▲ Awaiting Punishment. Fuguang also stated that after he and the others parted ways, he first fled to Qin San's house in Tanzikou to hide and find out what was happening outside. On the ninth day of the lunar month, he went to Zhang Awu's house outside the East Gate of Qingpu to help with work. Three days ago, he arrived on the boat of his cousin-in-law Chen Sankang in Sijing, where he was arrested. As for where Liu and Dai had fled to, he really did not know. After receiving the statement, Deputy Captain Lu immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Judicial Section for review and handling.</p>
