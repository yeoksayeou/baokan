<p>日本政友會調查全國經濟。其發表調查東京之報告。謂東京市及附近之失業者。約十二萬弱。比去年六月期間之七萬。增加五萬。失業中之無力借宿而露宿者。約二千名以上。小學校之學生。因無力上學而缺席者。去年五百名。今年增至一千四百名。政友會之發表比報告。所以攻擊現在之日政府。謂其不能救濟此失業者而使之日益增加也。然日人因商業之不振。而有此困窮之狀况。則固實情也。</p>
<p>其外因商業不振而人民受窮困之國。莫如德國。失業之人數。亦視他國爲多。德政府爲救濟失業之故。在預算外。定貨三萬萬馬克。此舉可保减少失業者十萬人。並規定凡不允减低貨價一成之廠家。不向定貨藉以促成物價之低减。夫以此法救濟失業。是否有效未敢深信。惟其政府之重視人民。不因爲大勢所成而置諸不聞不問之例。則其負責任之心。有非他國可比矣。</p>

<p>趙秀珍控朱敏堂以誘姦罪名起訴要求給七萬餘金法庭上笑啼皆作</p>
<p>趙秀珍秀麗大東跳舞塲舞女趙秀珍瓜字年華貌頗秀麗身段雖稍瘦損而修短適中致召登徒子所埀涎</p>
<p>爲買辦埀靑有鎭海人朱像傑又名朱敏堂者年少善賈現爲四川路一０六號雅利洋行買辦去秋涉足舞塲與趙發生關係惜好月不常圓歡會無幾中道相捐</p>
<p>瓜熟將蒂落惟趙則已珠胎暗結不久將見瓜熟蒂落此有母無父之兒來日大難趙亦以失身於朱心實不甘爰延張崇鼎律師對朱提起控訴趙母陸氏因女未成年則以法定監護人資格列名原告</p>
<p>旁聽舞女多昨晨屆開審之期一般好事之流尤其是舞女以爲此案之重要不亞於黃白英之與童三毛也故自八時後呼朋引類而往特區地方法院之第三法庭旁聽擁擠之情狀幾與黃白英案開審時不相上下</p>
<p>延頸三小時趙秀珍則與其母同至秀珍衣方格紅花紋之旗衫腹大如五石瓠益惹人注意承審推事葛之覃雖按時開庭但其他瑣案頗多而此案排在最後直至十一時四十分方審及此案到庭旁聽之舞女多未得座位延頸跂踵三小時不稍露疲憊之態可謂關心之切矣</p>
<p>朱敏堂不到被告朱敏堂臨訊不到由鄂森律師代表葛推事先訊問原告母女年籍住址後命原告律陳述起訴意旨</p>
<p>起訴誘姦罪於是張律師起立聲稱本案自訴人係以刑法二百四十條第二項誘姦未滿二十歲女子之罪起訴緣自訴人趙秀珍去年在大東跳舞塲爲舞女至秋間被告朱敏堂入該塲跳舞雙方始認識被告從此輒向趙誇其家之富有且謂渠猶無妻願娶趙爲妻是時趙年方十五受其誘惑</p>
<p>有肉體關係至十二月間彼此遂開大東旅社之一百二十號房間發生肉體關係本年正月十九日被告將旅社房間退去另租慕爾鳴路房屋遷往同居</p>
<p>示妻女照片經過若干時日得悉被告早經有妻且已生女而被告亦不稍諱並將其妻及女合拍之照片給趙閱看趙與被告同居曾經母氏允許至是遂將被告已有室家之事白於母前</p>
<p>後絕跡不來趙母頗重舊道德以爲女子應從一而終今木已成舟惟有命其退居妾位乃被告猶不相容反謂渠旣有妻孥斷難再娶自此絕足不至趙處在入特起訴</p>
<p>七萬三千元至附帶之民訴部份因趙孕有數月將來出生後敎養需資連同今之一切損失及趙日後之生活費等等共要求斷令被告給付自訴人七萬三千元云云</p>
<p>登報之問題繼由鄂律師起立聲稱本案有一先决問題且亦爲被告今不到案之直接原因蓋原告之狀甫經進呈傳票尙未掣發審期更未訂定而各報紙忽已競載措詞復與原告訴狀相同此種責任究應由原告代理人負擔抑由原告負擔因此種攸關風化之案事先不特未可任意宣洩即一經公開審訊而宣布與否尙須審判長斟酌况本案純係敲詐不遂而發生者被告見報後憤而致疾今故不能到庭隨將醫生診書呈案葛推事即諭知鄂律師關於此點可逕向報館澈究稿件之來源此時不必置辯</p>
<p>同居之經過旋傳趙秀珍訊據訴稱去年八月間在大東舞塲與被告相識彼乃以其家富有而未娶妻等詞迭與我語欲我相從我見其外貌頗誠實且知其僅二十四歲遂以身許之十二月初八日在旅館定情至正月十九日遷居慕爾鳴路三十七號此時我母亦經得知</p>
<p>懷孕已八月自遷居後一切開支皆被告供給二三四等月每月給我另用一百五十元被告曾屢次要求正式結婚然迄未果後我探悉彼已有妻室住辣斐德路辣斐坊隔壁十三號我懷孕至今已有八月</p>
<p>旁聽人笑聲葛推事得供因欲知其袵孕之外表情狀命退出證欄立於案下俾易觀察趙此際雖曾久在交際塲中一切司空見慣然今在法庭之內聞諭則不覺頰泛桃花祗得含羞移步玉立案下旁觀者見其便便大腹笑聲鬨然但即靜息仍由葛推事命回至原處</p>
<p>曾會見其妻繼續訊據供稱自五月起被告絕跡未來我處亦不供給家用感情於是破裂最近我曾赴被告家與其妻會見其妻年纔二十三歲知文墨與我情感尙洽被告之父母與長女皆在寗波滬寓唯一妻一女及男婦仆役　　感痛欲流涕庭上訊以對被告是否要求懲辦趙答稱彼如將我拋棄須有一種辦法倘或不棄亦應說明故請求庭上作主言至此頓有所感淚已承睫　　推事之意見時正屆午葛推事遂宣稱現代男女平權法律上無置妾之規定被告行爲在法律上應否負何種責任茲姑勿論惟就道德而言殊有不合今則木已成舟好在被告之妻旣與原告猶無惡感似不無轉圈餘地被告現不到案未能進行應再飭傳改期兩星期訊核倘仍抗不到案當予拘究也諭畢退庭</p>

<p>一昨有不相識之某君。函請爲之設計解决目前之生計問題。其人現在襪廠管工。月薪祇得十元。家有子女四人。其妻以乳哺幼兒。不能作工云云。予爲籌思竟夕。黎明即起。草此一篇假定之計畫似頗可行。夫以一人之力。月入十元。而欲膽養一家六口。誠是一種事實上之難題。惟其猶幸其未到無立錐地之境。尙有此十元之月入。較之失業而坐守者。猶勝一籌矣。予意乳哺幼兒。以致其妻不能工作。則第一解數。當以此兒寄養於鄉人之家。月貼四五元足矣。其妻乘在有乳時。出爲人家保姆。月入當得十元。而食宿之需。即由人家供給。而負擔可輕。其餘三子。年齡未詳。如皆自行乳哺。則依生理之常例。在乳汁盛時。當不受孕。其長子宜已十齡以上。是當携入工廠。令爲學徒。則此子之食宿有着。負擔又輕一分。二三子則送幼稚院。或寄托於人家敎養。兩人月費。不過十元已足。已則請於廠主請容一席之地。即宿廠中。則辦事時間。及所費心力自多。月薪因而漸得增加。宜在當然之列。即就目前論。夫婦二人之月入。共得二十元。支出三子貼費。共十五元。當得五元之餘。用爲儲備。設遇疾病。普通住院之資。猶且有着。故無租屋之必要。而本人旣住廠中。即能專心壹志。事事引爲已任。與共休戚。因此而得廠主之信任。擢畀要職。倚爲指臂。自在意中。三年之內。或爲廠長。或爲經理。亦未可知。目前雖覺離散。未免黯然。但無六口饑寒之虛。仔肩旣已一鬆。復有三年騰達之望。精神必爲一振。即使故我依然。仍其舊職。但以勤務加薪。天然累進。三年而後。至少能月餘十元。儲備敎育之費。亦旣有着。人生貴能隨遇而安。實行量入爲出之制。又何致如楚游之臣。竟凍餒其妻子耶。如其妻不願爲人傭。則一機當戶。二子同炊。亦不致陷於絕境。惟其勞苦實多。不如爲人保姆之安逸。且恐稍稍飽暖。而又誕生其第五子時。不免又回復原狀。徒增負擔與痛苦耳。吾爲人謀。必盡其忠。故有此附帶之忠告。某君住址。予已不能復憶。故隨筆記之。并以示與某君有同病者。</p>

<p>所謂裝飾賊者。大半係美國人。出入於巴黎各新裝公司。稍有往來。並各皆相稔。詎日久而彼輩竟異想天開。設見有一種新圖樣衣飾。懸於窗櫉。彼即依樣畫成標册。即㨗足先登。携赴倫敦紐約好萊塢各處照樣製成錦襲。大吹法螺。誇詡式樣之如何新頴。尺寸之如何適體。恃此新裝。利市三倍。待各新裝公司派代表携新裝赴各城。而其生涯已被若輩搶去大半矣。各新裝公司以長此以往。損失不貲。乃羣起謀對付之法。然新裝式樣。本人人可模仿。故又不能以法律起訴若輩。乃祇得謀消極之抵制。而巴黎却泊司待（新裝公司薈萃之所）頭各新裝公司之窗飾上。乃皆懸起模仿我們的新裝式樣。行同偷竊。各主顧欲參觀新裝請進內。我們不能把巧妙的新裝放在窗前。生恐被裝飾賊模仿了去。等標語。於是各種新裝。不敢再懸爲窗飾。而藏於內室。即偶有不識趣之裝飾賊。要求一觀新裝妄想摹倣者。咸遭拒絕。祇高貴之主顧。始獲一覩眞相。而從此裝飾賊乃無所施其技矣。</p>

<h3 id="c168">上海法租界之起源（上） <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 季平譯自字林週報</p>
<p>首先來滬之外人非法國人。至一八四七年法人孟提業氏來滬作法國領事代表。始有法人之足跡。當時商業頗爲冷淡。僅有天主敎神父數人駐此。孟氏有幹才。對於駐華法國事業。多所擘畫。彼來滬後未久。始有法國第一人來此經商。此人名芮米氏。經營鐘表及洋酒事業。自彼來後。法領事孟提業。即向中國當局要求。給一片地與法人。因孟氏深恐法人之微小商業。將爲英美商業所掩蔽。中政府當給與小地一方。於一八六二年五月十八日。法工董局成立。以愛當謨氏爲領事。當時英領事反對法人設立工董局。因其與各訂約國與中政府所訂之上海地皮章程不合。但法人不理。當時上海之外人商業。全在英租界。新設立之法工董。每年收入頗小。一八六五年預算。總收入可得十萬零三千兩捐稅。但其中四萬八千兩。來自烟館妓院賭塲之執照稅。按法時妓院及賭塲。在其他租界內。並不捐照或納稅。法租界之訴訟事件。辦理亦頗得法。但有一件足以證明法人不耐與其他租界合作。即一八六五年。一美人被一法人戕殺於一英國輪船上。是船停泊寗波。英人並未要求裁判。而法領事於審問凶手時。並不通知美國領事。或許其提出證據。問後即釋凶手。上海法國當局之意。認法租界爲永遠享有之割讓地。法總領事居租界之首位。工董局不過爲受彼直轄下之一顧問機關。法工董局無實權。足以往事覘之。遇工董局與總領事意見不合時。彼則毅然解散之。巡捕與義勇隊。亦受彼之管轄。作護衛焉。按總領事現爲高齋林氏。</p>
<p>當孟提業氏向中政府要求割讓地時。法國天主敎之勢力。逐漸趨於穩固地位。大禮拜堂建於徐家匯。各神父復在其處建住宅。迄今並未有所遷移。當時中國官府。對於天主敎勢力之危害國家。遠勝於法租界內之雅片烟及商人。此點當時官府。殊爲憤憤。天主堂曾被搶刦。神父被殺多人。徐家匯有女修道院。作救濟工作。當時華人中之迷信者。乃以石擊其窗。並衝入門內。以死恐嚇之。因之救濟工作。不能暢行。徐家匯天主堂辦孤兒院。結果亦有殉難之人。因當時華人殊不知法人之用意安在也。今日孤兒院收容無家可歸之兒童數百。敎以最上之手藝。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　是誰種福無意得鑽環　惟此因緣有心歌金縷</p>
<p>以前凡是嫁了人重行出山的姑娘們。往往有一個條件。不許伊　再用以前的名字。好像把身體給了他。連名字也給了他。下堂求去。重行登塲。不能再用舊日的商標。這其中似乎有點面子關係。其實蟬曳殘聲過別枝。還是一樣的噪聲。不許用舊名。似乎有些掩耳盜鈴。所以到了後來。也就不拘了。有幾個嫁人復出的姑娘。往往恨那　砧無情。故意的在伊花幟上。嵌一個所天的姓和名在內。如嫁過姓虞的。題名爲虞姬。嫁過姓謝的。換稱爲謝　之類。但他們以爲姬妾衆多。如梁上之燕。一聽其自來自去。風氣使然。也無足爲異。但他有一種。似乎嫁了一個人出來。生涯反而比前要好。大有一登龍門。聲價十倍之槪。尤其是一般闊人的姨太太。倘然一旦出山。更足以鬨動一時。在伊嫁了一個闊人出來。好似新得了一個榮耀的頭銜。頭銜越多。聲價越增。好似近來的政客。前淸時代也是官。民國時代也是官。軍閥政府出風頭。國民政府也出風頭。在客人們。當伊是天寳宮人。聽得些開元遺事。又知道某闊人的愛寵也不敢怠慢伊。因此左詩晨便問道。翠筠這一回出來。了。伊說難爲情去姐輕輕地的說道。不好呀。伊的老客人本來不多。這回出來了。伊說難爲情去看一班老客人。前天伊還和我說道。阿寳啊。你倘然看見某人某人。給我帶個信。我說檯面上沒有碰着過呀。今天倒很巧。碰着了你。你是在這裏做主人嗎。三阿姐那裏。你們是老朋友。可憐的帮帮伊的忙吧。燒香燒在枯廟裏。阿寳一連串的話。使左詩晨無所措詞。看見呌懺儂的局票發出去了。伊也到隣座上去應酬客人去了。停不到三分鐘。伊又跑過來道。三阿姐來。你說跟左翠雲的阿寳來過了。我還有好幾個堂唱。不能再等伊了。說著。帶着那位小先生走了。又過了十分鐘。改名懺儂的那位翠筠來了。左詩晨見了。不覺吃了一驚因想不過三四年不見。怎麼老了這許多。左詩晨幾乎喊出了阿呀兩個字來。因想計算年齡。至多也不過二十四五歲。難道眞如人家所說的美人年齡。以十年爲一世。從十五歲起。到二十五歲爲止。伊已經入於衰老時期了嗎。但是我看見人家二十四五歲的人。也有和十八九歲的女郎一樣的呢。</p>

<p>— 明</p>
<p>德國最近所出的小說大都可以歸在社會小說的一類因爲這學說都是叙述大戰終了以後的德國社會生活底各方面而且對於現代德國思想道德底最近趨勢可以作一極有益的索引在這樣的小說裏兩性關係的問題自然在作家們所用的題材中佔了第一個位置</p>
<p>支魏格</p>
<p>（Stefan　Zweig）底近著亦就是如此EsIst　Zeit是羅半小說集底最近一部中心人物當然還是和以前幾部一樣仍舊是羅蘭（Rulaud）這一套小說集雖則是太長太繁複但却是歐戰以還德國智識的與社會的生活底翔實的記錄這最近的一部寫的是近來在德國所發生的一種反動是對於那徒然主義派一和少年人底道德的弛放的一種反動原來德國自從大戰以後受了敵軍佔領要邑之辱一班靑年人多是精神頹唐悲憤絕望因而發生一種今朝有酒今朝醉的頹廢玩世的態度於是創出所謂徒然主義來這樣的主義在德國曾經很風行過可是近來德國元氣漸漸恢復民族的精神漸漸飛揚於是對於這自暴自棄甘心墜落的主義力和抨擊成有一種很有力的反抗支魏格底新著就晃寫的這兩派的鬥爭這部小說不但是極有趣味的社會寫眞而且還含着一件驚人的罪案情節一個在中上等階級很有勢力對這一層社會中的少女曾經作惡多端的老浪子被人謀殺了殺人的嫌疑落到一個靑年作家底身上這靑年作家雖然也是一個徒然主義派和那老浪子似乎是同志但他仍然有殺人的嫌疑因爲他曾經公然指斥過那老魔鬼底罪惡并且說過這老魔鬼死了可以替社會除去一害這部小說底一大半都是叙述這嫌疑是如何地籠罩在他身上擺脫不掉但後來一個已經逃走的少女被證明是眞凶手於是他脫了罪</p>
<p>亨利曼</p>
<p>(Heinrich　Mann)是湯麥斯曼底哥哥也是一位老作家他新近出版了一部短篇小說集題目是Sie　Sind　Jung內中的幾篇小說都是寫的德國少男少女底經歷趣味與優劣都不一律其中最好的一篇是寫一個結婚的男子道德弛放假仁假義地對待一切誰知後來他的兒子竟也用了這種狂放的假仁假義來對付他這篇小說是强烈得可怕的</p>
<p>蘇察威活</p>
<p>(Hans　Sochaczwewer)Menschen　Nachdem　Kriege的作者從文章上看起來恐怕是一位還年靑的人吧他這部書是拿出兩種的德國人來對照着寫這兩種的德國人是在大戰以後得到了他們的不同的人生觀的一種的型式是他所有的理想都幻滅了他的愛國心顚覆了雖然他的家庭生活比較地還安樂但便是這也不能使他不覺得做人是毫無意味的另一種型式是他的朋友和他純然兩樣的是把德國的戰敗和革命看作一章新書之開端覺得無論對於他的國家或是對於他自己個人都是還有很好的下文他如是安居樂業了做了一個電影編劇家而且和一位靑年的羅馬尼亞女子有過一段戀愛艷史書中寫他的性格寫得很好這部書並不是成熟的作品但是值得一讀</p>
<h3 id="c206">歷史小說家梵莫羅 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>（Walter　Von　Molo）在他的新著Die　Scheipung裏卻不做歷史小說家了他放棄了他那以前運用得成績卓著的歷史題材改用離婚做題材這部小說是一件不幸的婚姻的有趣的研究這婚姻是被妻所破壞的她不能使自己適應她丈夫底性情而且發現有了子女可以多些帮手去反對她男人她以爲婚姻只是一種暫時的結合沒有什麼特別的責任或義務的這是她自己假設的定理但是她以後就照她這定理行事了這部小說從字裏行間看來是贊成一夫一妻制的從它那表現社會趨勢的一點說來很可以拿來和支魏格底小說參看不過無論在形式上在風格上這部小說是都遠遜於支魏格底新著的</p>
<p>鮑却特</p>
<p>(Rudolf　Borchardt)底新著Dao　Hoffnungslose　Gescht是一部短篇小說集完全以男女之間的關係爲題材其中最長的一篇實在是一則男性研究這男人是爲了特質的目的而結婚的寫得非常精妙有趣使人想起注力於技巧的亨利及姆司（Henry　James）來而且文章的風格非常圓熟這倒是不出大家底期望的因爲鮑却特是現代德國最好的作家之一在本國極有聲譽不過在國外却不大有人知道然而地位和他差不多的作家</p>
<p>佛蘭克</p>
<p>(Bruns　Grank）在外國却很出名他那篇長的短篇小說政治小說（PoliticalNovelle)諷刺法國的外交名家白利安（Briand）的尤其是轟動歐美他最近的作品Der　Magier又是一部中篇小說題目中所說的魔術家是一個舞台指導是一位排演戲劇的天才他在奧國出演大獲成功之後突然失踪了據說是到美國某處去公演天才驚人的尼格羅戲劇了這部小說寫得也很好佛蘭克底長處却顯了出來</p>
<p>實騐主義的女作家</p>
<p>維基包姆（Ｖicki　Baum）是最近轟動德國的一個新作家她不但是寫實主義的信徒而且是實騐主義底實行者因爲她在寫她最近的那本小說Menschen　inHotel之前她特地到柏林底一家旅館去當了六個禮拜的女茶房以便獲得大旅館生活底眞相像她這樣至誠有耐心的作家眞可以說是少有的了她這部小說底背景是德國柏林底某大旅館書中人物都是旅館裏的客人當這部小說出版之後大大地成功竟被編成戲劇在柏林上演以後在維也納及其他歐洲大都會都演過所以往基包姆立刻成爲一個大衆作家了她是一個受過訓練的音樂家是柏林國之歌劇塲某樂隊長底夫人性愛漫游曾經單身到菲洲北部去游歷過</p>

<p>— 文質</p>
<p>郭子雄著</p>
<p>其實處於這時代那一個靑年不會有苦悶的襲擊老實說除非一般思想遲鈍神經麻痺的才不致於企感苦悶的到來而只知混天糊塗地過着麻木不仁的生活如果世間能有靈感這東西存在的話那末靑年的苦悶是無論如何不能消滅而且更時常滋長着的這實在因爲靑年的向上的慾望的太高啊不過我們所要求者是在生命的進展中雖然遭遇到環境的阻碍壓迫和束縛而感覺到痛苦與煩悶而求生的意志不可不堅强不可不在捲入痛苦與煩悶的漩渦中時時刻刻起來掙扎時時刻刻起來奮鬥去和阻碍壓迫束縛的力相搏戰充分地把生之要求發揮出來求得勝利這樣纔是可貴人生的意義把這種意義反映到文藝作品上去的纔是我們所需要的作品但是當我們每一翻到關於表現這類現代靑年的作品則給予我們的統是失望大多僅是一種萎靡頹廢的無意識的呌喊祇是洩洩心頭的憤火表示對於現狀的不滿沒有向着光明前進的志氣這種呌喊都只形成是呻吟吧了無非是一些臨陣畏縮的敗卒的乾喊吧了去文藝的領域尙遠</p>
<p>這本口供也是這類傷在型子中的作物爲了受不住心靈的催促今夜我要在你的眼前畫一道花押書一篇口供（一頁）大槪這便是作者的態度吧這裏包含十一篇散文口供（一）口供（二）怪誰你躱避我嗎謝絕逝水上年現代人的煩悶我的大哥巫山的一晚在廬山每篇共通的亂點即是口供式的訴說內心的苦悶那環境的桎梏所際遇來的</p>
<p>關於現代靑年最大的苦悶的象徵自然是愛這問題了實在愛給予靑年的必不是勝利即是悲哀不是謳歌即是誼咒然而當靑春之蓓蕾鮮艷而綺麗的時期有誰能豁免呢如果人類的感情之大可以令之一時息滅的話到也罷了可是這是决决不能的因之目下大半靑年的呌喊反映到文藝作品上去的都是詛咒這愛之歷程的播弄在這裏口供也是逃不出例外我提起筆來濡着墨和着淚帶着沉重的悲哀來同你寫也不管你接不接受我這番心意願不願聽我這無頭緒的話語我終於這樣的做了如其我是犯了罪的話那末你便是我的上帝希望你像饒恕其他的人一樣的也饒恕了我也望你開恩望你能允許我躺在你的身旁閉着眼做一刻兒的甘夢好暫時安息我彷徨的靈魂（一頁）因爲但我終究忘不了你生固然忘不了你死也忘不了你不怕到了有一天我的屍骨都化做了塵埃然而那塵埃裏每一粒細微的分子還包含有你的存在正像一個在沙場上倒斃了的征人雖然屍骨已經殭冷心兒已經不能再動但那游絲似的魂靈還忘不了他所從來的國家（九頁）雖然自己明白是走錯了路（二頁）但感情畢竟是一種微妙的東本睛說是尋常到也神秘得什麼似的說是神秘到也尋常哩而且靑年的心理狀態也大半如此你是一盞燈在黑夜裏在長途上在我的當前只要有了你不怕有風吹有雨打有豺𧳓開虎豹呌有大樹掀起狂暴的林濤我也不會怕人生是兩隻眼理想是一盞燈有了燈眼睛纔看得見有一了理想纔可以做人便此時我還能鼓着勇氣向前進也無非是爲了有你這一盞燈照著我在漆黑的昏夜裏在漆黑的長途上走（一三頁）這懷下的種種幻想那裏說得上勇氣與熱烈祇是這樣無病呻吟般的請你收下我這一個影子不要忘記了在你生命的園地中曾經開過我這樣一朶花同時也只有像精衛一樣的年年啣着石子帶着樹枝投進那茫茫的東海（一四頁）哦這就是所謂追求的價值了價值嗎</p>
<p>怪誰也一樣怪誰誰也不能怪自己把新的葡萄漿盛進了舊的革囊懺悔罷也用不着凋了的花蕾落了的葉子終是不能再長上樹枝的錯了麼讓它錯我要錯我要錯到底是岐路也得要走我要走走到它的盡頭（一五頁）一切幻覺的要求無非是莫忘了在這廣漠的人寰裏有一個這樣的我他愛你不一定要你愛他你恨他他却不一定就恨你（一七頁）雖則以爲別辜負了頭上的靑天足下的大地做人就得做就得認眞並且承認要是不攀登絕頂的高峯最好當初不要開步走中途退下去又何必（二一頁）但終於沒有確定的意志的啊</p>

<p>你躱避嗎也彷彿是一個型子裏脫出來的對於回憶的甜蜜甜蜜的回憶徒然傷悲當着生命的船兒碰着命運的礁石生固然好死也是應分和如其過去的因緣是值得珍重的那末請你記着我記着你一個曾經歷過的夢如其我們的相逢是不幸的那末請你把我忘記像忘記了一個無足重輕的人（三一頁）罷了</p>
<p>謝絕是表示自己的夢一般的從前霧一般的將來再加上灰色般的現在便是我的人生（三七頁）所以要原諒我姑娘我不敢以假的心來換你眞的情冷的唇來接受你熱的吻我不願我剩下的這幾天靑春消磨在你的懷裏因此我只好辜負你海一樣的深淸（三三頁）那是何等不堅定的思想呵</p>
<p>逝水才是眞眞悲感過去的生命是一幅黯淡的圖畫（五二頁）了的確如其人生的旅途儘是平平坦坦的沒有甚麼除峻也沒有甚麼崎嶇在數十載活着的一段光陰中生活上不起甚麼劇烈的變遷心靈裏也不受甚麼强烈的打擊那末縱使能夠寗寗靜靜的度了黃昏又是黎明做人的意義也不怕不免喪失而人生的價值也怕會全盤消滅罷（四三頁）不幸我們的作者雖然知道前程是山窮水盡了我又何苦在山窮水盡的當中去尋抑暗花明的出路（四七頁）對於自己的出路却依舊是比那西風裏帶了箭的雁兒還要彷徨還要悽楚（五三頁）呵神經質的靑年的消沉恐怕也是象徵了多數的吧</p>
<p>四年一篇是我在這其中最愛好的誠然回頭自己問問這四年的大學生活究竟給了我些什麼（五七頁）我相信這是誰都不能回答的本來當那大學生活快要結束的時候兩種相反的感想必同時存在在每個人的心裏的這便是厭惡與留戀然而也終於是枉然的終於需要人也戴上了方的帽子穿上了黑的衣衫從尊嚴中接受了虛榮的學位走出了校門踏進了另一條生命的路屑起了做人的責任（六二頁）至於踏入社會後是怎樣那才眞飄渺呢</p>
<p>現代人的煩悶眞是世紀病者的心理速寫對人生對社會對國家已沒有勇氣（六八頁）呵這是該下以怎樣的針堿使他們回復原來的生命力這實在不能　得的靑年爲什麼只知道咀咒命運</p>
<p>我的大哥的表現力是很好的眞情摯意寸雨斷腸但婦人的悽咽與孺子的啼哭已不能喚醒你墓中的亡魂你是去了從今後一切人世的變幻聲與色的誘惑都不能再走進你的心你是去了不再管花的開謝不再管月的圓缺不再管草的靑黃不再管葉子的長落你是去了（八二頁）在這淡淡的幾句中多麼充滿了吊奠的悲哀更當這兄弟死別的悽凉的時候那能免掉追憶和內心的訴苦呵</p>
<p>巫山的一晚和在廬山是游記是脫不了落魄才子之風臨勝景而感慨</p>
<p>這本集子的文字很是優美生動凋刻的句子也不多見可惜太替個人作無意識的發洩了其原因便是缺少發揮和表現自己生命的要求的能力於是淪入於無意的傷感了這也或許是作者生活的關係不過這點確是希望作者要努力克服的要知我們的民族所以受誤至此這方面的萎靡消沉所謂多愁善感的神經質也影響到不少的啊</p>

<h3 id="e1">The National Government Orders Guidance for Enemy Soldiers to Return <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>If they can abandon rebellion and follow the righteous path, their merits will surely be recorded, and their flaws forgiven.</p>
<p>The National Government in Nanjing recently issued an order, the original text of which is as follows: According to a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, it has been over three months since I, Kai-shek, was ordered to suppress the rebellion. Fortunately, relying on the prestige of the Central Government, the rebellious troops disrupting the Longhai, Pinghan, and Jinpu lines have been successively defeated, and Jinan has been recovered. These have all been reported and are on record. Currently, deployments are being made for pursuit, with the aim of achieving complete subjugation and pacification. However, considering that since the completion of the Northern Expedition, our Central Government has always been dedicated to peaceful unification, implementing political tutelage, and organizing demobilization, all decisions have been made by gathering collective strength and consulting public opinion. It is not the practice of autocratic dictatorship, nor is there any intention of endless military force. When Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan initiated the rebellion, their treacherous actions became increasingly apparent. I, Kai-shek, repeatedly offered earnest advice, hoping they would awaken to the situation and avoid the misfortune of war. However, they remained obstinate and relied on their accumulated military strength, suddenly seeking to act recklessly in the Central Plains, and not hesitating to undermine unification. The Central Government's desire to settle matters and pacify the people became more urgent, but their schemes to incite war and harm the country became even more pressing. The Central Government had no choice but to dispatch troops for suppression. However, the removal from office and arrest were limited to the one or two ringleaders. All these developments have been witnessed by the people of the country. I, Kai-shek, have followed the instructions and upheld the virtuous authority. As reports of victory arrive, I feel sorrow rather than joy, and deep pain for the visible scars and hidden suffering. Now that the main forces of Feng and Yan have been defeated and the entire rebellious army is on the verge of collapse, I especially hope that the Central Government will uphold its initial intention of leniency and give them an opportunity for self-renewal. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, as the ringleaders of the rebellion, cannot be pardoned by law. However, their subordinate officers and soldiers have all contributed to the revolution in the past, and were misled into taking the wrong path due to coercion by Yan and Feng. Their situation is indeed understandable, and their mistakes are regrettable. It is now proposed to issue another proclamation, clearly advising all officers and soldiers of these units that if they can deeply understand the greater cause, release the instigators, and await the Central Government's punishment, they will be specially rewarded. As long as they extricate themselves and return, and Yan and Feng relinquish their military power and leave their so-called defense zones, then all units, originally Central Government troops, will still enjoy the same treatment as Central Government troops, without any discrimination. The Central Government only seeks to complete unification, maintain discipline, and break the feudal separatist situation. All other issues can be resolved peacefully. The poverty of the country and the suffering of the people have reached their limit. The Communist Party, like a raging flood or a ferocious beast, is taking advantage of our nation's troubles to collude and spread rapidly, posing a great threat to the entire country. I, Kai-shek, constantly reflect on my unfulfilled responsibilities and lack of sincere credibility, which have led to former comrades-in-arms slaughtering each other and watching the Communist Party become increasingly rampant. I regard this as a great disgrace. I only hope that all officers and soldiers of these units will awaken their conscience, fundamentally change their ways, and no longer head towards self-destruction, making pointless sacrifices for Yan and Feng personally. They should no longer be incited by the reorganizationists who are creating opportunities for the Communist Party, but should unite to eliminate the Communist Party and the reorganizationists who collude with the Communists, preventing them from causing harm in Wuhan from reoccurring in Pingjin. What I, Kai-shek, seek is only the consolidation of unity, the guarantee of peace, and the completion of the mission of revolution. This is not a matter of personal resentment, and I dare not boast of my military prowess. However, the state of unity must not be allowed to be disrupted by anyone. If this renewed warning proves ineffective, then I must continue the suppression in accordance with the previous orders, and completely eliminate the rebellious troops in the shortest possible time to alleviate the people's suffering and secure the foundation of the nation. I humbly request instructions on whether what I have stated is appropriate.</p>
<p>Moved by the unceasing labor and hardship of our people, and extending a sincere heart to the world, these are the words of a benevolent person. This is precisely the aim of the government's efforts over the past year to seek unification and peace, and it is also what has been repeatedly stated in this unavoidable use of force. Having read the telegram, I truly commend it. The crime of Yan and Feng in instigating rebellion is indeed unforgivable. However, considering that the officers and soldiers of these units previously knew to serve the National Revolution, their adherence to rebellion may not be from their hearts. Moreover, at this time, they should awaken. If they can abandon rebellion and follow the righteous path, then the soldiers who hold weapons and wear armor are all good guests and sharp instruments of our nation. The government commends their admiration of righteousness and will surely record their merits and forgive their flaws, preparing them for the selection of capable individuals to defend the country and resist foreign aggression. If they stubbornly refuse to repent, they are willing to share the evil deeds of Yan and Feng, and will ultimately not be tolerated by our people. The path of obedience or rebellion, of leaving or staying, is for them to choose. This special announcement is hereby issued to make it known to all. This order is issued by the Nanjing National Government today upon receiving a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, announcing to the northern generals: The actions of the various armies have always been considered to be the result of coercion by Yan and Feng. If they immediately break away from Yan and Feng and return to the Central Government, they will be given important positions. Otherwise, the Central Government will exert all efforts to suppress them, etc. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Feng's Army Prepares to Retreat to Shaanxi <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Part of the army has already moved, and most of the ammunition, etc., has also been transported.</p>
<p>Reliable sources in Beiping recently confirmed that Feng Yuxiang transported a portion of his powerful troops, along with a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and food, to Shaanxi on the 18th. This is likely because he realized that the anti-Central Government military movement had completely failed due to the Jin army's defeat in Jinan, and he will immediately lead his troops back to Shaanxi to maintain his strength.

<h3 id="e7">Unemployment Problems in Japan and Germany <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Seiyukai in Japan is investigating the national economy. They released a report on their investigation in Tokyo, stating that the number of unemployed in Tokyo and its vicinity is approximately slightly less than 120,000, an increase of 50,000 compared to the 70,000 in June of last year. Among the unemployed, approximately more than 2,000 are homeless and sleeping in the open. The number of elementary school students absent from school due to poverty has increased from 500 last year to 1,400 this year. The Seiyukai is releasing this report to attack the current Japanese government, saying that it is unable to provide relief to the unemployed, causing their numbers to increase daily. However, the impoverished state of the Japanese people due to the decline in commerce is indeed the reality.</p>
<p>Besides Japan, the country where the people are suffering due to the decline in commerce is Germany. The number of unemployed there is also higher than in other countries. To alleviate unemployment, the German government has earmarked 300 million marks outside of the budget for orders. This measure is expected to reduce the number of unemployed by 100,000. It also stipulates that orders will not be placed with factories that refuse to reduce their prices by 10%, thereby encouraging price reductions. It is difficult to say whether this method of alleviating unemployment will be effective. However, the government's emphasis on the people, not ignoring or disregarding them because of the overwhelming situation, demonstrates a sense of responsibility that is unmatched by other countries.</p>

<p>[P Remains of Swedish Explorer</p>
<p>Discovered on White Island</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, Norway, 22nd – On July 11, 1897, the renowned Swedish explorer Dr. Andrée, accompanied by two companions, set off from Danes Island in a balloon, intending to fly to the North Pole. Since then, nothing had been heard from them. After thirty-three years, this great mystery has finally been solved. On August 6th of this year, a Norwegian scientific expedition discovered a body on White Island. A diary found in a body bag revealed it to be Dr. Andrée. A second body was found in a dilapidated tent, frozen and completely intact with its clothing perfectly preserved. A third body and some equipment were found in a small boat. All must be brought to Norway soon. However, White Island was visited half a month ago, and nothing was found. According to the scientific expedition, the bodies were covered by thick ice, which recently melted due to heavy rain, exposing the bodies. The tent was about 200 yards from the shore, indicating that Andrée and his companions were forced to land and lived on this desolate island for some time. Andrée's diary is frozen and cannot be opened yet. However, the last page contains the words "July 18, 1897, North 83 degrees, East 32 degrees." Near the tent was the skeleton of a polar bear, indicating that Andrée and his companions killed it for food.</p>

<p>Archduke Otto and His Mother Allegedly Secretly Arrive in the Capital</p>
<p>Guomin She, Budapest, 22nd – Rumors of a royalist plot to restore the Habsburg dynasty by enthroning the eighteen-year-old Archduke Otto have been rampant recently. Although the Hungarian government has made every effort to deny the rumors, it has admitted that border guards and police throughout the country were ordered to investigate the traces of a car a few days ago. The car carried a woman and a young man whose faces were covered by heavy veils; the young man was only eighteen years old. As a result, several people resembling them were arrested, but none of them were whom the authorities wanted to detain. The judicial community is currently very active, so many people believe that Archduke Otto and his mother have secretly arrived in the Hungarian capital. However, judging from the attitude of the Hungarian government, it seems determined to do everything possible to prevent a coup.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Germany Implements Unemployment Relief <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Guomin She, Berlin, 22nd – The German State Railways, facing poor business performance and a sharp decline in revenue, also followed the government's policy of reducing unemployment today and ordered goods worth a total of 300 million marks outside of the budget. This measure is expected to reduce the number of unemployed by 100,000, as all factories accepting orders guarantee to hire new workers and not extend working hours. In addition, following the example of the Ministry of Post, orders will not be placed with factories that refuse to reduce the value of their products by 10%, in order to promote lower prices. Currently, public sector extra orders have reached 500 million marks, which will greatly benefit the national economy.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd – Suzuki Kisaburo of the Seiyukai reported on the results of the economic survey of Tokyo Prefecture at the headquarters yesterday afternoon, saying that the number of unemployed in Tokyo City and neighboring counties is approximately 120,000, a slight increase of 50,000 from the 70,000 in June of last year. At the prefectural employment referral offices in six locations, the unemployed arrive like a tide from dawn, and even the cheapest hotels are unable to accommodate them. There are more than 2,000 homeless people, more than four times the number of homeless people below 500 in the summer of the previous year. The orphanage currently houses 2,300 people and has no capacity to accept any more. More noteworthy is the number of absences among school children, which has increased from only 540 last year to 1,400 this year. The government authorities' procrastination in providing unemployment relief is truly outrageous.</p>

<h3 id="e64">After the Jin Army Retreats to Dezhou <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yan Xishan Secretly Goes to Shijiazhuang, Northern Pinghan Railway, to Discover Landmines</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence After the Central Army occupied Jinan on the 15th, the situation in the north changed drastically. The Jin army is now retreating to the north bank of the Yellow River and is reportedly deploying defenses in the Yucheng Plain, still in the same positions as a month ago. It is rumored that a large part of the Jin army is trapped on the south bank and has not been able to retreat. It is uncertain whether they have been surrounded, but the losses are undoubtedly a fact. When the Central Army launched a major offensive against Jinan, Yan Xishan sent his Chief of Staff Gu Renfa to give orders to the Second and Fourth Route Commanders Fu Zuoyi and Li Fuying on the 9th, ordering them to defend the line of Tai'an, Feicheng, and Changqing to the death. Fearing that the troops would not obey orders, he also sent Zhou Dai and Xie Lian as war supervisors. On the 14th, they passed through Tianjin to Jinan. Yan himself secretly arrived in Shijiazhuang from Taiyuan on the 16th, changed to a car, and drove to Pingyuan and Yucheng via Cangzhou. It is said that after inspecting the defenses on the 17th, he boarded a train from Pingyuan to the north. At 7:30 AM on the 18th, a special train arrived at the new station. The curtains on the train windows were drawn tightly, prohibiting idlers from approaching. Immediately, the train turned around and headed north, transferring to Shijiazhuang via Fengtai. It is confirmed that Yan inspected the front line this time and decided to deploy new defenses in Dezhou in order to make a final stand.</p>
<p>At 10:05 AM on the 18th, a gatekeeper named Tong noticed a mound of earth on the track at the 25th bridge, four kilometers from Tianjin. He immediately suspected that someone had buried a landmine and reported it to the stationmaster. The railway bureau sent more than ten engineers and workers on a handcar. Digging it out was quite difficult, and it was not until 11:05 AM that it was dug up. At this time, the third express train from Peiping had already arrived. A red flag was immediately raised to warn the train, and it stopped. It was not until 1:30 PM that the landmine was dug out. It was shaped like a bent arm, with a diameter of fifteen inches and weighing over twenty catties. It was taken back to the new station police third sub-section for safekeeping. A report was made to the garrison headquarters and the military police headquarters, and many police and military police were dispatched to arrest a farmer in the wheat field. However, this was unrelated to the incident. According to the analysis of most people, the landmine was buried with the intention of blowing up Yan. Yan departed from Pingyuan on the night of the 17th and needed eleven hours to reach Tianjin. The time of burying the landmine must have been after 9:40 AM on the 18th, because if it had been buried before 9:00 AM, the fourth train would have been in danger. This is very clear. If they had predicted that Yan's special train would pass Tianjin after 10:00 AM, the weight of the special train, which only had one first-class and one third-class car, was so light that the train traveled quickly, and it did not stop along the way, only changing water at the locomotive in Cangzhou. Therefore, its speed was reduced by three hours, and it was fortunately spared from danger. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Victory of the Central Army on the Pinghan Line <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Central, Left, and Right Routes for Attack, Occupying Many Key Locations in Successive Days, Airplanes Bombing Zhengzhou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence The news of the battles on the Pinghan Line has been quiet for a month. Although the Central Army and the Yan-Feng army have had minor skirmishes during this month, the petty gains and losses are insignificant, and they remain in their original positions, maintaining the status quo. The reason for this is that the Central Army's strategy focused on the Longhai Railway in the past, while the Jin army focused on the Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan Railways. Each side took a defensive posture. In addition, the severe drought in central Henan during July and August made the suburbs extremely hot, with the Fahrenheit temperature often exceeding 100 degrees. Therefore, they had to rest slightly in preparation for a decisive battle in the future. Until the capture of Jinan, the Central Army took the opportunity to become active, changing from a defensive state to an aggressive political force on both the Longhai and Pinghan lines. He Chengjun, Commander of the Third Army Corps on the Pinghan Front, convened military meetings at the headquarters in Luohe for several days, gathering commanders Xu Yuanquan and Yang Huchen, as well as division and brigade commanders from the front line, to formulate an attack plan. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to divide the troops into three routes to advance north simultaneously and to coordinate with the Longhai Front, limiting each army to capture Xuchang in the shortest possible time and then advance to Zhengzhou. The following is a compilation of military news received in the past two days:</p>
<p>Yang Huchen's Army Occupies Peicheng Luohe, 19th Special Telegram: Our right-wing army, the 17th Division of Yang Huchen's troops, engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy at Biandan Xu Xingzhuang at dawn on the 19th. Our army bravely attacked and, after four hours, the enemy was unable to withstand and collapsed in disarray towards Suqiao. At noon on the same day, Peicheng was completely occupied, and many enemies were killed and hundreds captured. Our army is taking advantage of the victory and is currently pursuing and advancing. Liu Peixu's troops occupy Xiaoshangqiao Luohe, 19th Declaration: The new Second Brigade of Liu Peixu's troops recently advanced to the south of the Tulu River and occupied the line of Jiangzhuang and Hezhuang. Our armored vehicles also advanced from near Yuzhuang towards Xiaoshangqiao and occupied Xiaoshangqiao on the 18th, then advanced towards Dashiqiao. The two enemy battalions were defeated by us and fled north.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhichu Advances to the South Bank of the Guo River Luohe, 20th Telegram: Xiao Zhichu's Shi and Wang brigades have already advanced to the line of Ping'anji, Huangsongkou, and Dailangdian on the south bank of the Guo River. Chen's brigade also attacked from the left side against the enemy in the areas of Qianhou Wuji and Zhang Naimaimiao and crossed the Guo River with a part of their troops to occupy Dingzhuang and Zhengzhai, clearing the enemy on the south bank of the Guo River and directly taking Taikang to threaten the flanks and rear of the enemy in the direction of Zhecheng. It is also heard that the enemy in Taikang City is extremely panicked and has hired hundreds of carts to prepare to retreat.</p>
<p>Air Force Bombs Zhengzhou Luohe Air Force, 21st Telegram: In recent days, the Fourth and Fifth Squadrons of our Air Force have each dispatched multiple Curtiss and Caudron aircraft, carrying dozens of 60 and 120-pound bombs, and have flown to Zhengzhou simultaneously, hovering in the sky and separately dropping approximately thirty or forty bombs on enemy barracks and important agencies, all of which exploded. There was also a new regiment of soldiers in training, and four bombs were dropped, killing many of them, while the rest fled in a panic.</p>

<p>Specifying the Date of the Meeting and the Attendees</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence The issue of the joint suppression of communists in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has attracted considerable attention after the fall of Changsha. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters has decided to convene a joint meeting of key party, government, and military figures from the three provinces to deliberate on the specific situations of each province and determine measures to ensure local stability. It has been very busy with this matter in recent days. The meeting period was initially set for the 25th of this month, but has been changed to the 27th. The selection of attendees has also been specified: the provincial government will be represented by the Director of Civil Affairs, the provincial party headquarters will be represented by a committee member, and the general headquarters will be represented by experienced personnel. The meeting location will be at the Garrison Headquarters, hosted by the Pacification Section of the Garrison Headquarters' Adjutant Office. On the 21st, Director He Yingqin telegraphed the Fourth Route Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters in Changsha, the Ninth Route Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters in Nanchang, and the Provincial Government and Provincial Party Headquarters in Hubei, requesting that each attend at the specified time and report two days before the meeting. The original telegram is as follows: "It is hereby decided to convene the Pacification Conference of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi at this Garrison Headquarters on the [blank] day of this month. Please have the party, government, and military agencies of the three provinces each select one commissioner to attend the meeting and jointly plan the proceedings. However, the Fourth and Ninth General Headquarters must send experienced personnel. The provincial governments will be personally represented by their respective Directors of Civil Affairs. If it is difficult to attend due to special circumstances, please send experienced personnel with expertise in rural cleansing to participate on behalf of them. Please report on the [blank] day and await reply. He Yingqin bows. (August 21st)"</p>
<h3 id="e68">Hunan Province Merges Eleven Agencies <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Agency Personnel Stop Receiving Pay, Education Undertakings Virtually Suspended</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence The public and private losses caused by Peng and Huang's burning and looting in Hunan this time amount to no less than tens of millions of yuan, and it will take more than a short time to restore and compensate for the damage. Currently, the government organs in political aspects have moved to the Autonomy Preparatory Office, the Civil Affairs Office is borrowing the Second Middle School, the Finance Office is borrowing the Second Middle School Attached Elementary School, and the Construction Office is borrowing the Municipal Preparatory Office. The Education Office was initially located at the Second Middle School but moved back to its original office yesterday. All personnel of the above agencies are uniformly only given a monthly food allowance of seven yuan and have stopped receiving pay. The pay will be disbursed after the bandits and communists are suppressed, causing the lives of Hunan's agencies and staff to become more difficult after the great looting. The military organs include the Fourth Route Headquarters, which is borrowing the Youth Association, and the Rural Cleansing Headquarters, which is borrowing the Model Women's Vocational School. In addition, organs such as the Ordnance Depot, the Army Hospital, and the Wounded Soldiers' Rehabilitation Institute have not yet been formally restored. In terms of party affairs organs, the Provincial Party Headquarters is borrowing the Changsha County Middle School, and the Changsha City Party Headquarters has been scattered and has not yet recovered. The Changsha County Party Headquarters has not suffered much loss and is still operating as usual. In terms of education organs, the Provincial Education Association, Sun Yat-sen Hall, Museum, Library, and Popular Education Hall have all been burned down and cannot be restored at present. Although the government has not issued a formal order to suspend schools, judging from the current financial situation in Hunan Province, it will probably not be easy to open them in fact. The only source of funds for the party, government, military, and judicial expenses in Hunan is to rely on the opening of the rice customs. Because Hunan has a bumper harvest this year, it is estimated that at least three million piculs of rice can be released, and each picul can be charged three yuan, which can collect nine million yuan to make up for all expenses. The opening of the customs is scheduled for September 1st. The price of rice per picul in Hunan is currently only six yuan, and adding a donation of three yuan will only reach nine yuan. The price of rice in Hankou is above twelve yuan, so this income is relatively reliable. However, He Jian believes that after such a great robbery, the vitality has been injured, and all non-urgent organs should be abolished to alleviate financial pressure. Yesterday, he specifically ordered the abolition and merger of eleven organs and the statistical surveying and measurement classes (about 880 students) to implement a policy of reducing government. The instruction reads: In order to comply with the order, it is found that Hunan Province has been harassed by bandits and communists, and its vitality has been depleted. The financial difficulties have reached their limit. During this period of suppression, although the administrative construction, local autonomy, and other matters in the whole province are all important plans, it is necessary to consider the facts and temporarily reduce the scope or separately abolish and merge them for selective implementation to maintain the current situation. It has been decided by the committee of this government that the expenses of each agency shall be issued according to the budget of the 18th year, except for those that should be abolished or merged. The salaries of the staff shall be discounted in accordance with other regulations to show thrift. As for the Hunan Local Autonomy Preparatory Office, the Local Autonomy Training Institute, and the two statistical surveying and measurement classes, they shall be temporarily suspended. The local autonomy assistants in each county shall be abolished uniformly. The Sun Yat-sen Library, the Museum, the National Arts Hall, the Reformatory, and the Hunan Budget Committee shall all be abolished together. The Mass Education Committee and the Elementary School Teachers' Qualification Examination Committee shall be merged into the Education Office. The Tung Tree Planting Committee shall be merged into the Construction Office. This is a temporary measure to relieve the financial distress and has to be done. We will discuss the restoration after the financial strength is slightly sufficient. In addition to the separate orders, the heads of the bureaus, offices, halls, and institutes shall immediately comply with the order and report the suspension, completion, merger, transfer, and receipt to be examined for verification. This order. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Hunan Province Establishes Post-War Rehabilitation Committee <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Raising Funds for Communist Suppression and Post-War Relief, Accepting People's Petitions for Post-War Issues</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Communist bandits have ravaged Hunan Province for more than three years, initially from Chenzhou and Guilin in southern Hunan to western Jiangxi, then spreading from western Jiangxi to eastern Hunan, and then to western and northern Hunan. Even Changsha, the provincial capital, was occupied by the Peng bandits. The suffering throughout the province has been extremely severe, causing the wealthy to flee the province and the poor to experience even greater unemployment. Providing comfort and post-war rehabilitation is truly imperative. However, at a time of financial scarcity in both the public and private sectors, everything from suppressing the communist bandits and comforting refugees to rescuing the people and stabilizing society requires money. It is necessary to establish a special organization to plan for the most effective way to raise large sums of money and carry out these undertakings. Therefore, on the 18th, He Jian convened a joint meeting of party and government officials and decided to organize the Hunan Post-War Rehabilitation Committee. The committee members appointed include: Wang Qi, Zhang Jiong, and Tan Changkai from the Provincial Steering Committee; Zhang Kailian, Cao Bowen, and Zeng Jiwu, members of the Provincial Government; Wang Jiading, Director of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters Business Office; Fang Kegang, Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Education Association; Cheng Xiwen, Supervisor of the Provincial Relief Committee; Zuo Xueqian, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; and gentlemen Peng Zhaohuang, Luo Xiankai, Chen Binsheng, Chen Runlin, Xiao Du, Huang Zhenyuan, Wang You, Shi Yi, Huang Yanjun, Su Li, Chen Jieshi, Zhao Heng, and Lei Zhuhuan, a total of twenty-four people. The inaugural meeting was scheduled for the 19th. Separate letters were sent to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce, agricultural, and industrial sectors, requesting each to nominate one person for supplementary appointment, with the aim of achieving the effect of eliminating bandits and pacifying the people within the shortest possible time.

<h3 id="e70">Nanchang Bureau of Social Affairs Director Xiong Guohua Executed for Communist Activities <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xiong Guohua, Director of the Nanchang Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on the 7th of this month on suspicion of being a communist bandit. At that time, due to the seriousness of the case and the fact that other related criminals were still being investigated, the authorities temporarily kept all information confidential. The bandit has now been thoroughly interrogated, and the evidence is conclusive. He was executed by firing squad at Shagu, outside of Deshengmen at around 8:00 AM on the 20th. Xiong was from Duchang, Jiangxi Province, and graduated from the private Xinyuan Middle School in this province and Sun Yat-sen University in Guangdong. He served as Director of the Political Department of the Fifth Division and Director of the Special Party Headquarters. He was appointed Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs in September of last year. He had shown no signs of wrongdoing since taking office. However, last month, when the Communist Party was approaching Nanchang, the authorities implemented martial law and inspected postal and telecommunications. A piece of mail from Shanghai addressed to Liu Jianshan, delivered by Wang Xiang, a clerk at the Bureau of Social Affairs, was intercepted. The postmark was from a different location. Upon opening it, it was found to be a novel with many illegible characters written in the blank spaces. After careful study by the Garrison Headquarters, it was discovered to be a plan for a communist uprising scheduled for August 20th. The department then detained Wang Xiang and interrogated him at the Garrison Headquarters. Wang confessed that Liu Jianshan was an alias for Xiong Guohua. After obtaining this confession, Commander Zhang sent the Chief of Military Law to the Municipal Government to summon Xiong. Xiong was chatting with Zhang Hongzao, Director of the Public Security Bureau, in his office. When the Chief of Military Law arrived, he presented Xiong with the documents related to the case. Xiong remained silent. Director Zhang then escorted Xiong to the Garrison Headquarters for custody. After several interrogations, Xiong admitted to joining the Communist Party last year with the intention of turning the city's primary schools (which are under the direct jurisdiction of the Bureau of Social Affairs) into a vanguard for communism. He also confirmed that the communist uprising plan scheduled for the 20th of this month was genuine. After obtaining this confession, Commander Zhang, recognizing the gravity of the case, reported it to the Provincial Government and then to the Central Government for instructions. He subsequently received orders to handle the matter strictly in accordance with the law. Commander Zhang, considering that Xiong was using his position as Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs to secretly act as a communist puppet, a crime that was unforgivable, executed him by firing squad on the 20th. At 7:30 AM, the Garrison Headquarters dispatched a battalion of soldiers to escort Xiong along Zhongshan Road and Desheng Road before executing him outside Deshengmen. At the time of his execution, Xiong was wearing a singlet, white cotton pants, and slippers. The white cotton sign inserted on his body read: "Executed: Xiong Guohua, traitorous communist bandit leader, former Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, for carrying out communist plots and instigating an uprising." A large crowd of onlookers gathered. After the execution, his family hired people to buy a coffin and collect the body. The Garrison Headquarters announced Xiong's crimes in a lengthy proclamation, which is omitted here. On the morning of the 21st, Wang Xiang and three other communist bandits related to the Xiong case were executed at the parade ground, greatly reassuring the public. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Fujian Provincial Department of Finance Loan Issue Still Unresolved <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Business Community Appeals for Exemption from Loan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Department of Finance's temporary loan of 500,000 yuan from the General Chamber of Commerce has not yielded any results as of yesterday's meeting. The Commercial Research Institute convened a meeting of various merchant guilds at 4:00 PM on the 16th to discuss the matter. About a hundred merchants and representatives from various guilds attended. Fang Yingtuan, dispatched by the Department of Finance, first reported to the merchants that Director He of the Department of Finance, facing financial difficulties during this lean season, had no choice but to seek a loan from the various merchant guilds, offering tea tax and bamboo and timber tax as collateral, and issuing treasury bills to offset the two types of tax payments. He had already reported this at the General Chamber of Commerce yesterday. However, Director He was well aware of the current economic decline. If the full amount of 500,000 yuan was difficult to raise, Director He suggested reducing it to 300,000 yuan, with the tea, timber, and money guilds each contributing 80,000 yuan, and the remaining guilds contributing 60,000 yuan collectively, which would be easier to achieve. After the report, he withdrew to rest at the General Chamber of Commerce, awaiting the results of the meeting to report back. The institute then convened the meeting. Everyone agreed that in the past, when government offices sought loans or donations, merchants had always endured the pain and contributed, as they still had some surplus capacity. However, the city's economy is currently in extreme decline. In addition, the ongoing war has disrupted river transportation, causing delays in the settlement of drafts and suspensions of payment deadlines. Bankruptcies have occurred one after another, amounting to several million yuan, a situation not seen in decades. The economy has been severely damaged and cannot be restored to its original state in the short term. Yet, the Department of Finance is still demanding loans, which is truly beyond the merchants' capabilities. Furthermore, loans must be assessed based on one's ability to repay. Currently, merchants are borrowing from all sources to save themselves from ruin, and even then, they are often unsuccessful. To comply with the authorities' wishes, they would have no choice but to sell their wives and children, which the authorities would surely not condone. As a result of the discussion, it was concluded that there was no room for negotiation on this loan. This situation was reported truthfully to Commissioner Fang Yingtuan of the Department of Finance, and the Chamber of Commerce was requested to earnestly implore the Department of Finance to understand the merchants' difficulties and exempt them from the loan. It is still unknown whether the Department of Finance will agree. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Dispute Over Fujian Province's Supervision of Salt Tax Collection <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Previously, due to a lack of educational funding in Fujian Province, the provincial government decided to levy an additional salt tax of 50 cents per dan of salt, which would yield 120,000 yuan per month. This amount would be allocated monthly by the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office to the Educational Funding Management Office for educational expenses. However, after the establishment of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office this year, the salt tax was transferred to the office for collection, resulting in significant arrears and jeopardizing educational funding. Now that the summer vacation has ended, provincial schools are unable to open due to a lack of funding. Therefore, the provincial government dispatched Chen Peikun, a member of the Provincial Government, and He Gonggan, Director of the Department of Finance, as supervisors of the salt surtax. They separated the collection of the principal and surtax on salt. The principal tax would still be collected by the Inspection Office, while the surtax would be collected independently by representatives dispatched by the supervisors and remitted to the Educational Funding Management Office for use. However, the Inspection Office believed that this action hindered its authority and repeatedly protested to the Provincial Government, strongly advocating for the continuation of the original system. It also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting instructions. The Ministry of Finance sent a notice to the Provincial Government to persuade them, but the Provincial Government believed that the matter concerned the future of education in the province and deemed it imperative. Therefore, the collection of the surtax continued. Since the collection began on the 1st of this month, the daily revenue from the surtax has been approximately 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, which has greatly satisfied the education sector. The Inspection Office, unable to prevent the collection with the Ministry's order, stopped the transportation of salt from various coastal fields to show its resistance. As a result, the salt stored in the Fuzhou Nantai Salt Warehouse, which supplies nearby provinces and counties, is becoming increasingly scarce, and prices are rising daily. It also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Provincial Government, stating that, according to a telegram from the Fujian Salt Affairs Inspection Office, the office has been allocating the collected salt surtax as planned since last year, with no arrears. The provincial government sent police to stop them, claiming they were implementing supervision and disrupting salt affairs, and requesting that it be stopped. Upon investigation, the Fujian Salt Affairs Inspection Office's collection of salt tax, after allocating funds for local garrison expenses and repaying foreign debts, has no surplus to remit to the Ministry. In addition to ordering the Inspection Office to handle the collection of the salt surtax in accordance with the established plan, the supervisory measures should be revoked immediately, and Commissioners He and Chen should be recalled, and the collected principal and surtax should be returned to the Inspection Office for proper management to maintain the salt administration. The Provincial Government has now drafted a reasoned reply to the Ministry's telegram. Regarding the shortage of salt in the Nantai Salt Warehouse, it has ordered the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office and the Special Commissioner's Office to consult and prepare capital to purchase and transport salt to provide supplies.

<p>Commemorating Liao Zhongkai, Condemning Wang Jingwei, and Suppressing Communism</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: At 7:00 AM on the 20th, people from all walks of life in Xuzhou held a citizens' assembly at the Public Assembly Hall to commemorate Liao Zhongkai, condemn Wang Jingwei, and eradicate communism. Many organizations and groups participated. Wu Zhishang, the Propaganda Minister of the County Rectification Committee, presided over the meeting. Wu first reported the significance of the meeting, followed by speeches from Gao Yinzu, a special commissioner of the Central Party Headquarters, Zhang Jichun, a representative of the Xuzhou Headquarters, and Zhang Bingkun from the Third Division Special Party Headquarters. Subsequently, two telegrams were proposed and approved on the spot: [T13]1[/T] A telegram to console the soldiers at the front: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Commander-in-Chief Jiang in Guide, Director He of the Hankou Headquarters, and Director He of the Xuzhou Headquarters, forwarding to the officers and soldiers at the front fighting against the rebels: In recent days, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang have launched a full-scale invasion, attempting a final struggle. Fortunately, our armed comrades have united and fought valiantly, repeatedly repelling the stubborn enemies on the Longhai and Pinghan Railways, effectively eliminating the strength of Feng's troops. On the Jinpu Railway, Taian and Jinan have been recovered, and the Yan army has completely collapsed. The news of victory has brought joy to the people of Xuzhou. Today, we are holding a citizens' assembly to commemorate Mr. Liao Zhongkai and to promote the condemnation of Wang Jingwei and the eradication of communism. We unanimously resolved to send a telegram to console the soldiers at the front, urging them to continue their efforts to achieve complete success. We eagerly await the day when you directly attack the enemy's lair and swiftly eliminate the rebels, completing the unification. With deepest anticipation, the Xuzhou Citizens' Assembly respectfully sends greetings. [T13]2[/T] To the compatriots throughout the country, for transmission by various newspapers: Since the start of the campaign against the rebels, corrupt and reactionary elements in various places have been stirring up trouble. Wang Jingwei, disregarding his comrades, has secretly entered Beiping to collude with the Western Hills faction and reorganize various factions, holding their so-called expanded meeting, groveling and flattering Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, selling out the party and betraying the country, a crime that cannot be forgiven. Furthermore, he has instigated the communist bandits to capture Changsha, burning, killing, looting, and turning the city into a wasteland. His madness has reached this point. Today, on [Day illegible] in Xuzhou, we are holding a citizens' assembly. The public is indignant and unanimously advocates for denouncing Wang Jingwei, eradicating the communist bandits, completing the campaign against the rebels, and achieving peaceful unification. We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will work together to secure the future of the party and the country. The Xuzhou Citizens' Assembly respectfully sends greetings. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the crowd marched in the rain around the city for a week, dispersing at 11:00 AM. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Guangzhou Abolishes Special Municipality System <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau Transferred to Direct Jurisdiction of Provincial Government</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Following the central government's decision to change special municipalities to municipalities, the Guangzhou Special Municipal Government only abolished the term "Special" on the 18th of this month. The new seal was only issued in the middle of this month, so the Special Municipal Government only started using the new seal on the 18th. No reorganization ceremony was held; only the name was changed. Because when it was changed from an ordinary municipality to a special municipality, all the old systems were not changed, this abolition of the special system could save a lot of trouble. However, there is one special feature of this reorganization of the Municipal Government, that is, the Public Security Bureau, which was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government, simultaneously separated from the Municipal Government and became the Provincial Public Security Bureau, under the direct jurisdiction of the Provincial Government. In addition, the Public Security Bureau usually handles police affairs, and its funding comes from a 1.5% surcharge on the housing rent in Guangzhou. The monthly income from this housing rent for police expenses is considerable. Now that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been changed to the Provincial Public Security Bureau, and the Provincial Government has clearly ordered that this housing rent for police expenses will still be handled by the Public Security Bureau, this income has been invisibly transferred to the Provincial Government's authority along with the Public Security Bureau. As a result, the Municipal Government's monthly income has been reduced by a large sum. The above are the biggest changes after the abolition of the Guangzhou Special Municipality. As for the internal organization of the Municipal Government, it remains the same. On the 18th, after the Municipal Government was reorganized, it immediately ordered the various bureaus under its jurisdiction, including the Public Works, Social Affairs, Education, Finance, Land, Health, and Public Utilities Bureaus, and the Secretariat, to start using the new bronze seals and submit the old seals with clipped corners to the Municipal Government for verification and destruction. The bureaus have complied with the order. The report of Mayor Lin Yunhai to the Executive Yuan is attached below: A report for reporting matters: Based on the Executive Yuan's Directive No. 2402, which was based on the National Government Office's letter, which was based on the National Government's order to abolish the designation of Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Guangzhou Special Municipalities as municipalities, all previous appointments of mayors of these special municipalities should be canceled and new appointments should be made in accordance with the newly formulated municipal organization law. The order was forwarded to the Municipal Government for compliance, and based on the National Government's appointment order, Lin Yunhai was appointed as the Mayor of Guangzhou Municipality. Based on this, and based on the Executive Yuan's Directive No. 2560, which was based on the National Government's issuance of a bronze seal with the inscription "Guangzhou Municipal Government" and another bronze seal with the inscription "Mayor of Guangzhou Municipality," and based on the Executive Yuan's Directive No. 226, which was based on the National Government's issuance of seven recast bronze seals for the various bureaus of Guangzhou Municipality, the Municipal Government complied and changed the name of Guangzhou Special Municipality to Guangzhou Municipality on August 18th of this year, and changed the Municipal Government to the Guangzhou Municipal Government. The various bureaus under its jurisdiction also changed to the Guangzhou Municipal Social Affairs, Finance, Public Works, Land, Education, Health, and Public Utilities Bureaus on the same day, and started using the seals on the same day. In addition to reporting to the Guangdong Provincial Government and sending separate letters, this document is hereby submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and forwarding to the National Government for record. It is for public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan. (August 18th)</p>

<p>Gangster Banditry Sweeps Various Towns: For the past month, the practice of gangsters extorting loans has been rampant in this county. Recently, although several bandits have been captured, several have been killed, and several bandit dens have been burned down in various places after the military police's suppression, the practice of extorting loans has not diminished as a result and continues unabated, showing how rampant their power is. It is said that Tai Bao A Shu secretly went to Shanghai again recently to contact other gangs, and many of them have jointly entered the county in the past few days. They have gathered in Liujia Yanqiao, Zhuajiaowan, Luwan Temple, Xinmiao, and Jiehe, totaling about 800 people. As for guns and ammunition, they have also purchased a lot recently, which were transported by sea. At Ma Shouchang's home north of Liujia Yanqiao, Tai Bao A Shu has extorted loans many times. The other day, he wanted to extort 3,000 yuan, but Shouchang was already penniless and unable to pay. He then increased the amount to 30,000 yuan and threatened him in every way. Shouchang immediately moved his family to avoid them. Recently, his house has been occupied by these people. On the afternoon of the 21st, a small part of the bandits, numbering about 80, armed themselves and paraded with red flags raised high, starting from Liujia Yanqiao to Baziqiao and other places to demonstrate, and instigated local ruffians to spread rumors everywhere, saying that the anti-smuggling team had been bribed by these people and that these people would soon attack certain towns and cities. As a result, people were apprehensive. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 AM on the 22nd, all the guns of the 8th Public Security Sub-bureau in Qianjiawei were looted by the gangsters. (Qianjiawei was originally a place where gangsters often appeared, and the chief of the Public Security Bureau, seeing the weakness of the police force, dealt with them evasively, fortunately preserving his safety, so this time the bandits came to loot weapons was not unexpected.) At that time, the telephone in the telephone bureau was also destroyed. However, merchants were not looted. It is estimated that the number of bandits was over one hundred, all armed with guns. Then they roared away. At 2:00 PM, it was heard that the towns of Langxia and Luxiang were both looted at the same time. From this, it can be seen that the gangsters were divided into several groups.</p>
<p>Another message: The notorious lake bandit leader, Tai Bao A Shu of the Pudong gang, who has been entrenched in the Liujiaqiao town in Jinshan County, where Shanghai, southern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang meet, has been actively expanding his bandit party in the past two or three months and has increased it to as many as eight or nine hundred people. Since the middle of this month, it has been frequently rumored that the bandit leader Tai Bao will lead his troops to loot the town of Xincang in Pinghu County. As a result, the residents near the town were extremely frightened. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 22nd, the bandit party members indeed gathered in Liujiaqiao and divided into three routes to the northwest: one route to Luxiang Town in Jinshan County, numbering about one hundred and several tens of people, and one route to Langxia Town, not far from Luxiang, also numbering about one hundred and several tens of people, all armed with various military weapons and several machine guns, driving more than ten boats and more than twenty horses, advancing by both water and land; another route of only thirty or more bandits advanced towards Qianjiawei, three miles from Zhangyan, led by Tai Bao himself leading the main force (about two hundred or more people) as support for the three routes. At about 1:00 PM, the three routes arrived at the same time. However, although the towns of Luxiang and Langxia each had a Public Security Branch Bureau, each only had ten or more police officers. Qianjiawei only had a police station with eight police officers stationed there. With a total of only thirty or more guns, the police officers saw that the bandits were powerful and well-equipped and were outnumbered, so they could only stand by and watch. All the guns were looted. Although the police officers of the Luxiang and Langxia bureaus resisted slightly, a sudden clash occurred. As a result, most of the guns were also looted. The bandits searched the residents of the two towns extensively, looting countless weapons and wealth. However, shops and poor residents were not harmed. However, more than ten people were killed or injured during the police-bandit resistance (names have not yet been identified). On the Qianjiawei side, the bandits did not cause any disturbance. By evening, the three routes of bandits had joined together again and advanced towards Zhujing, claiming they would loot Zhujing. When the bandits came, they first cut all the telephone lines, so news was blocked. It is also heard that the bandits all wore gray shirts and trousers, which looked like uniforms, and all their actions seemed organized.</p>

<p>Committee Member for Clearing Backlog of Cases Transferred: Tang Yiqin, a member of the county government's Committee for Clearing Backlog of Cases, has recently been transferred by the Suzhou High Court to serve as a candidate judge in the First Branch of the High Court in Qingjiangpu. The vacancy will be filled by Lu [Character illegible] Jie. Mr. Lu arrived in Wuxi from Suzhou yesterday and immediately contacted County Magistrate Pan to discuss everything. It is heard that Mr. Tang will have to go to Qingjiang to assume his new post within a few days.</p>
<p>Pawnshop Embezzlement Causes Huge Debt to Qian Zhuang: Jun Da Pawnshop in Qingyang Town, Jiangyin County, is jointly operated by Sheng Yulin and others from Changzhou. Over the years, Jiang Xiangxian, the pawnshop's accountant, Cao Zhifu, the cashier, and Shen Jinqing, the public relations manager, conspired with internal and external staff to embezzle and misappropriate money from the pawnshop, reaching more than 70,000 yuan. Recently, they even packed up the gold jewelry stored in the jewelry room and transported it out. However, they were discovered by Wang Miancheng of the Xian De Pawnshop in this county and were immediately detained. After the San Yinhao (three silver firms) and San Qianzhuang (three money shops) of this county, namely Bao Kangrun, Yongjirun, Ruichangrun, Rui Yurun, Fuchangcheng, and Yongsheng, were reported, and seeing that the pawnshop was going bankrupt and still owed huge debts, they each sent a representative to Qingyang to negotiate seriously. Unexpectedly, Jiang Xiangxian, Cao Zhifu, and others had already heard the news and fled without a trace. At that time, the Suzhou and Jiangyin silver firms and money shops also sent representatives to Qingyang and held a maintenance meeting at the pawnshop. After discussion, it was resolved that the Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiangyin silver firms and money shops would organize the Suzhou-Wuxi-Chengjiang Creditors' Group. All the pawnshop's affairs would be temporarily maintained by the group. It is heard that the pawnshop owes a total of 110,850 yuan to the Suzhou, Wuxi, and Chengjiang shops, and owes 54,000 yuan to shareholders in Shanghai. The items currently stored in the pawnshop include 65,000 yuan worth of clothing and 16,000 yuan worth of gold jewelry, and over 14,000 yuan worth of silver jewelry. After offsetting debts with stored items, it is estimated that about half the amount is still owed.</p>
<p>The Private Anti-Smuggling Team Launched a Large-Scale Suppression of Bandits: The Second Team of the Seventh Anti-Smuggling Brigade engaged in a fierce battle with bandits at the Jialingtang Xiadianqiao area on the border of Yu and Xi (Wuxi). The bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, fled towards Yuanshan Dang, detouring to Yangcheng Lake to hide. After receiving a report from Li Chuquan, the leader of the Second Team, Wu Hanzhuang, the Captain of the Seventh Brigade, immediately led his subordinates, Zhao Jingshu, the leader of the First Team, Huang Xizhang, the leader of the Third Team, and all the team members, as well as Wang Wenhai, the No. 7 patrol captain of the Third Team, Dai Shoushan, the deputy captain of the Commercial Patrol Team, Huang Zhenou, and others, along with more than twenty patrol boats, to Dang Kou (location) yesterday to meet with the Second Team to encircle and suppress the bandits in Yuanshan Dang.</p>
<p>Police Brigade Captain Replaced Yesterday: Zhu Zhenguo, the captain of the County Police Brigade, has been repeatedly accused to the provincial government, and the provincial government secretly investigated and found the accusations to be true. The county was ordered to dismiss Zhu and appoint Wang Wei to take over in Wuxi. Captain Wang went straight to the team yesterday morning to take over after being appointed.</p>

<p>Citizens of Xixi sent a telegram to the province to appeal that Sun Zuji, the former magistrate of Wuxi, be approved to resign and that Pan Zhong be appointed to succeed him by the Department of Civil Affairs. It is now known that the people of the county, including Zhang Tong, have sent a letter requesting the Municipal Funds and Property Management Committee to thoroughly investigate the numerous irregularities in the municipal funds handled by Sun while he was the Director of Municipal Preparations. Unexpectedly, it was discovered that Sun had bribed and released a large number of thieves before his departure, and a telegram was immediately sent to the provincial authorities requesting them to send personnel for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Measures to relieve the financial difficulties of various county administrations: During the 294th provincial government meeting, the Department of Civil Affairs proposed measures to relieve the financial difficulties of various county administrations. Item 3 stated that the administrative expenses of all institutions with special funds should be paid from the special funds. After discussion and approval, the Department of Finance issued an order to all counties to implement it. All expenses of the county's construction bureaus, as well as agriculture, forestry, and sericulture fields, will be paid from the construction special funds and agricultural improvement mu (unit of area) levies collected by the respective counties. All subsidies originally provided by the provincial treasury will be suspended.</p>
<p>Reactions to the telephone rate increase: After the telephone bureau issued a circular on the rate increase, users have been quite critical, generally believing that Zhenjiang's telephones are unreliable, the equipment is outdated, and the operators are unqualified. Although the authorities have been repeatedly requested to rectify the situation, no action has been taken so far. Now, a sudden increase of one yuan per month has been scheduled to take effect on September 1, and users are rising up in opposition. Among the users, shops account for the majority, all demanding that the trade associations of various industries send a telegram to the Ministry to temporarily postpone the increase. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the Ministry yesterday, requesting that the rate increase scheduled for September 1 be implemented at a slower pace.</p>
<p>Curbing the high price of rice: The price of rice in various places had previously fallen due to the congestion of imported rice and the expectation of a bumper harvest in various places this year. However, rice merchants in Zhenjiang, regardless of selling at a loss, were unilaterally raising prices due to the high cost of purchasing goods. The county party department believed that the rice merchants' actions were clearly manipulating the people's food supply and decided at the eighteenth executive committee meeting to send a letter to the county government to stop it and to summon the rice merchants for talks.</p>

<p>The crackdown on gambling is expanding: The Fourth Branch Bureau of the Xiannvmiao Public Security Bureau in the county was previously reported to have had its office destroyed by people involved in gambling. It is now known that the Director of Public Security, upon receiving the report, immediately appointed Chief Inspector Liao Qiang to lead a team to investigate and arrest the ringleaders and bring them to justice. After receiving the order, Liao rushed to the location and liaised with Branch Director Zhang in a conciliatory manner. When this failed, the Director and Chief Inspector apprehended Yan Lu, and another named Nan, and brought them to the bureau this morning (the 22nd). The shops in the area immediately closed in unison. The local party department then convened an emergency meeting of various agencies. The result was that the local security was patrolled by teams from the water and land public security bureaus, and the Chamber of Commerce was instructed to persuade the shops to open immediately. However, as of the time of publication, it is said that the shops have not yet opened. Chief Inspector Liao has been recalled to Yangzhou by telegram from Director-General An. How this matter will be resolved is still uncertain.</p>

<p>Bandit lairs in the southern countryside completely burned down: After the bandits in the western countryside rioted in the Wujieqiao area, they were encircled and suppressed by the military police and retreated to the Yingyougang area. There were countless thatched houses in the area, all built by the bandits and containing many belongings. The military police set fire to them to prevent them from being used by the bandits again.</p>

The county government and the public security bureau immediately telegraphed police stations at various ports and main roads to investigate and arrest him, but he had not been caught by night.</p>
<p>The Department of Construction notified the county to resume transportation: The Department of Construction telegraphed the county government to order the Construction Bureau to quickly repair the automobile road between Baipu and Pingchao in the two counties of Nantong and Rugao, which was bombed by bandits, cutting off traffic on the Sanggang Bridge.</p>
<p>Representatives from the reclamation area came to Tongzhou to discuss the aftermath: Ma Yuren, who was entrenched in the Huainan reclamation area, was completely routed by the 133rd Brigade on the 16th.

<p>Communists infiltrated the city and were captured: The First District Security Corps received a tip-off yesterday that Que Guobang (also known as Fu Chen), a bandit from the Lifaqiu area, was hiding in the Guangya Lou Inn in the city. The head of the corps immediately sent detectives to investigate and followed him, capturing Que Fuchen and four people from the northern countryside who had recently moved to Shi Qing's house behind Tanggang outside the West Gate. After interrogation at the corps headquarters, they all confessed to being communists and were sent to the county government for verification and handling. Also, the First Sub-Station received a tip-off that Liu Songgui, the bandit leader of Yelin Township, and Fan Jia, the wife of the bandit from Yuanjiaqiao, had entered the city to buy goods. The patrol officer immediately supervised the patrol chief of the Benjingmen Inspection Post to search for them and captured them one after another, escorting them to the county bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandits in the western countryside mutilated each other: A traveler returning from the western countryside said that after the bandits suffered heavy losses this time, the northern and southern factions became suspicious of each other.

<p>A barge stole and sold goods: Twenty-six cases of Beiping brand cigarettes, produced by the Shanghai Public Land East Tobacco Company, were loaded by boatman Gu Tianqing from the Zhenjiang transfer station to the Wubei Fuji distribution office. However, when the boat reached Gaoyou, the boatman suddenly had malicious intentions and moored the boat in the center of the lake. Every day, he used small boats to transport the goods to the city and colluded with Zhang Baoxiang, a resident outside the South Gate, to contact Shenchang and other stores to sell them. It is estimated that more than a dozen cases were sold, and the remaining goods were loaded and sold in Jiangba. He carried more than 4,000 yuan and absconded. Fortunately, the Zhenjiang transfer station heard the news early and sent someone to Siyang to find Gu and lure him to Jiangba, where he was temporarily detained by the local chamber of commerce.</p>

<p>Wu Chonghui robbed a widow's home: In the Dushan Village Wu Chonghui area, there lived a widow, Jin Wu, whose daughter-in-law was also a widow and whose grandson was only fifteen years old. They were diligent in farming, and their family was gradually becoming well-off. On the night of the nineteenth, dozens of bandits suddenly arrived with handguns, knives, and clubs at Jin Wu's house, smashing the door and entering the room. They ordered accomplices to stand guard outside the door and fire shots as a warning. Neighbors heard the gunshots and were afraid to help. The thieves first entered Wu's bedroom and looted everything. Unable to find any cash, they stripped Wu of her outer clothing and burned her skin with wax candles. Her cries were unbearable to hear. They then went to the bedroom of her daughter-in-law and grandson. Fortunately, the daughter-in-law had escaped through the back door, and the grandson was also curled up in the dark, not revealing his presence. They were not harmed. After looting for two hours, they formed a team, fired shots, and left in a northeast direction.</p>
<p>A child bride fell into the river: Hu Heshang, a farmer from Liangzhuangfang, had a young daughter who was given to Ding Aqi's family in Zhengjingfang as a child bride at the age of nine. She has been working diligently for seven years. The other day, she went to the river to wash her feet late in the evening. At that time, it had rained heavily and the river was swollen. She accidentally lost her footing and fell into the river. By the time neighbors realized what had happened and rushed to rescue her, she had already died.</p>
<p>Local bandits Wang Adi and Wang Xiaodi escorted to He Xin Cang: Two notorious bandits, Wang Adi and Wang Xiaodi, were captured by the seventh company of the second battalion of the provincial security team.

<h3 id="e85">Xiaoshan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is actively established: The Xiaoshan Urban and Township Chamber of Commerce previously received the recommended list of committee members of the various township chambers of commerce from the Provincial Merchant Organization and Unification Committee, in accordance with the methods of recommending members of the various county chambers of commerce, and the Xiaoshan, Linpu and Yiqiao Chambers of Commerce have been issued with seals and will be established immediately. It is reported that the Chambers of Commerce in Wenyan, Guali, and other places are also actively organizing.</p>
<p>Request for the prosecution of unscrupulous merchants exporting rice: Linpu in Xiaoshan has always been an area where rice is gathered. This spring, the price of rice has risen repeatedly, and most rice shops have made money. Recently, new goods have been put on the market, and the price of rice has plummeted. Rice shops have felt a slight loss. Unexpectedly, Han, an unscrupulous merchant from Hangzhou, bought all the large-grain rice and secretly transported it overseas, causing the price of rice to rise by one yuan again on the 19th. It has now been discovered that Han has transported 700,000 shi (unit of dry volume) of rice. Xiaoshan and Linpu account for more than 10,000 shi. Yesterday, the public learned of the inside story and telegraphed the province to strictly prosecute Han, and to detain the rice Han transported to Shanghai and use it for price stabilization.</p>
<p>Prostitutes and opium boats along the river are difficult to eliminate: Prostitutes are rampant along the river in Xiaoshan. It is said that the flower boats in Wenyan and Yiqiao are specially for river travelers and mountain travelers to play, and the private prostitutes in Linpu's flower and opium dens are also places for merchants to entertain themselves. Young people have gone astray and become addicted to bad habits, without knowing it. Now, the provincial and county authorities are strictly prohibiting prostitution, but the long-standing habits in our Xiaoshan remain the same. The various public security branch bureaus have been repeatedly accused by the local people of protecting prostitutes and opium dens. Therefore, there are questions about dispatching police to drive them away, but it is difficult to eliminate them all at once.</p>

<p>The entire China Cigarette Factory was burned down: The China Cigarette Factory in Wojiagang, Jiangbei, in this port, which specializes in making various brands of paper cigarettes for customers, was quite developed. Yesterday evening, at about 9:00 p.m., the associate manager was out, and the staff and workers were all chatting and relaxing at the door. No one was taking care of the smoking room, causing the cigarettes to burn and catch fire. By the time they realized it, the entire room was on fire, and people could not get close to it. The fire spread to other rooms, becoming a raging inferno. The Yi Long volunteer fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. The fire was too fierce, and it was difficult to extinguish due to the inconvenience of drawing water. After burning for more than an hour, all the houses were reduced to ashes. The loss was estimated at 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, truly a great calamity.</p>
<p>The Dongchen Security Corps in Xiangshan was disarmed by bandits: There are many wealthy households in Dongchen, Xiangshan (20 miles from the city). To defend against bandits, a security corps was established to guard the area, so they have been safe for many years. On the night of the 14th of this month, thirty to forty bandits suddenly went to Nanbu Village and looted the guns of the anti-smuggling team there. Then, they swarmed to Dongchen and stormed the security corps, confiscating all eight rifles. It is said that after the bandits obtained the weapons, they intended to rob the wealthy households, but the people there sounded the alarm by banging gongs and firing shots, so the bandits fled back to Nanbu by their original route.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Shaoxing <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Petition to abolish the triangular surcharge: The Shaoxing County Executive Committee believes that the provincial government's decision to levy a three-corner surcharge per tael of grain for land development fees is illegal and harms the people. In recent years, various counties have been plagued by rampant bandits and frequent natural disasters, coupled with heavy public debts and special donations, which have exhausted the people's resources. The current socio-economic situation has reached a dead end and cannot bear any further burden. Moreover, there are too many surcharges levied with the grain tax, almost equal to the regular tax. If a new tax is added, it will inevitably exceed the amount of the regular tax, which violates the central government's orders. It was proposed at the twenty-ninth meeting to petition the Provincial Executive Committee to strictly correct this and allow it to be forwarded to the Central Government for a clear order to abolish it, and to show compassion for the people's difficulties. It was also requested that the party departments of the various counties unanimously advocate to alleviate the people's hardship.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau apprehended a thief from Tonglu who fled to Shaoxing: The Shaoxing Public Security Bureau received a request from the Tonglu County Government to assist in apprehending Mo Youfu, Zhao Ziliang, and other thieves who fled to Shaoxing for trial. The bureau dispatched four police officers and two detectives, each armed with guns, to work with the Keqiao police on the 21st to apprehend Zhao Ziliang's father and his wife, as well as Mo Youfu and three others in Panjiawu. Two leather suitcases and dozens of pieces of clothing were also seized. They will be escorted to Tonglu for trial in a few days.</p>

<p>Bail for the staff of the military recruitment team: The Songxia Public Security Bureau learned that a military recruitment team was acting arbitrarily within its jurisdiction and had no official documents from the county government to inform them, fearing that there was something else going on. On the afternoon of the 16th, they went to intervene with the county defense team and escorted six staff members to the city on the 17th. The trial judge, Zhu Yao, opened the court for trial. According to their confession, they were sent by the First Branch Office stationed in the city to recruit people. Later, the chief of the office, Ye Chuanyi, sent a letter to confirm this, but the letter stated that they were ordered to recruit soldiers and were being unreasonably suppressed, and requested to be sent to the province for handling. Zhu ruled that since the office had not consulted with the county in advance and had arbitrarily carried out recruitment everywhere, it was not only disrupting the administrative system but also hindering local security. He ordered the staff members to sign and wait to be sent to the province for handling. The chief of the office has now personally gone to the government to provide bail.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Foreign Merchants Mixing in Chinese Manufacturing Markings <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Tobacco Exchange Industry Asks to Ban Them; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks for an Investigation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Municipal Social Bureau yesterday regarding the protection of domestic cigarettes, stating that it was presenting a case. On the 21st of this month, the Tobacco Exchange Industry Association sent a letter stating that, according to reports from the Nanshi members of the association, there are recently ten-pack Gu Yin brand cigarettes sold by promoters along the street to colleagues. The packaging box shell is printed with the words "Made in China". However, after investigation, Chinese cigarette factories do not produce this brand name. It is obvious that foreign merchants are deliberately confusing the situation, which not only hinders the business of Chinese merchants but also has a huge impact on the future of domestic products. It should be forwarded to the higher authorities for a thorough investigation to benefit the industry and attached a Gu Yin brand box shell. After investigation, Chinese factories do not produce Gu Yin brand cigarettes. How can they be printed with "Made in China" on the box shell without stating the company name and arbitrarily disturbing the truth along the way? It is obvious that they are deliberately impersonating, and the harm to the business of domestic products is not small. A special letter is sent with the original box style to the council, and it is requested that the council approve the transfer to the Trademark Bureau for a thorough investigation to prevent counterfeiting and protect the industry. The dispute in this case is neither a question of whether the trademark itself is registered nor a dispute over which trademark, Gu or Wotun, was used first. It is only because the cigarette box is printed with the four characters "Made in China" that, according to the investigation, Chinese cigarette factories do not produce this product, and the actual name of the company is not stated, which is close to impersonating the name of Chinese merchants. Therefore, it is requested that it be transferred for a thorough investigation. The argument here does not involve the scope of trademark exclusive rights and does not seem to be within the jurisdiction of the Trademark Bureau. The council believes that foreign merchants are using the mentality of Chinese people to promote domestic products, and such promotional texts have long become commonplace. The foreign merchants themselves may defend that the four characters "Made in China" are marking the place of manufacture, not marking the nationality of manufacture. Then, the first thing to be marked in the text should be the name of the company, and the word "in" should be added above the four characters "Made in China" to indicate that they are not shadowing the name of Chinese merchants. Otherwise, the intention is to take advantage of the trick, which is actually harmful to the legitimate rights of ordinary Chinese merchants. It seems that the prohibition should be actively sought to prevent future imitation. It is appropriate to submit the cigarette box to the council for review to determine whether it can be forwarded to the municipal government to prohibit the promotion of this cigarette in the Chinese border and inform the public security bureau to order each district to pay attention to the prohibition at any time to protect the rights and interests of Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Fourth District Party Department Opposes the Increase in Water Prices in the Concession <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Fourth District Party Department of this city believed that the Public Concession Water Company had another proposal to increase prices, and on the previous day, the Forty-seventh District Executive Committee Meeting decided to issue a declaration opposing it. The original text is recorded as follows: The establishment of the water company was originally to alleviate the shortage of urban water materials and became a kind of common-need enterprise. This kind of enterprise is very different from other enterprises. The water materials are indispensable to every member of the community every day, so the water industry must not be solely for profit under the premise of reasonable remuneration. The establishment of the water company is actually a social public cause and cannot be compared with other enterprises that are for profit. The water price standard of the Public Concession Water Company has increased from 10% to 12%. The burden of water materials on the citizens has increased by 10% out of thin air, which is already unbearable. Now, there is another proposal to increase prices, which is to directly regard water materials as commodities and regard users as customers. The users cannot be without water, and the company uses this to coerce them by repeatedly increasing prices. At a time when prices of various commodities are soaring, the citizens are already feeling overwhelmed by other living expenses, and the water company is arbitrarily increasing water prices, which is tantamount to prohibiting citizens from using water and cutting off the beverage that is commonly needed by the citizens. In recent years, the company's income has increased invisibly due to the increase in housing prices. If the water price is increased again this time, it will inevitably affect the increase in housing prices. Moreover, the company's annual surplus is very large. If it is said that the gold price is affected and the expenses are insufficient, then it can be started from the cost reduction and frugality can be practiced on weekdays. With the company's large income, it can alleviate the temporary tightness. However, the company does not think about the root cause and wants to treat the symptoms by increasing the water prices of the citizens, which is actually placing the citizens in desperation. If the opposition is not raised immediately, the burden on the citizens of the concession will increase and they will suffer a lot of hardship in their lives. The members of this department, in their pain and anger, issued a special declaration opposing it, hoping that the people from all walks of life will rise up together, so that the citizens of the concession will not be subject to the company's unreasonable demands. This is very fortunate. This is the declaration.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Banking Association yesterday to urge the already closed Maoye Bank to cash its banknotes. The letter stated that on August 22, the Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter stating that at the 72nd Standing Committee Meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, it was proposed that Maoye Bank has been closed for a long time, and various shops have accumulated a large number of banknotes from the bank. Please find a way to transfer the request for cashing them, and it was decided to send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the Banking Association to urge the cashing, etc. After investigation, the bank's banknotes were previously used in the Suzhou market, and the number of shops accumulated a large amount. Now it has been a long time, and there is still no preparation for it. According to the previous discussion, it is appropriate to send a letter to check. It is hoped that you will immediately inform the Banking Association to urge the cashing to help circulate funds, etc. After investigation, Maoye Bank has been closed for a long time, and the number of banknotes scattered in various places is no less than the number of merchants and people. The proposal of the General Chamber of Commerce to ask your association to urge the cashing to help circulate funds is a proper way. It is appropriate to send a letter to check and reply immediately so that it can be forwarded.</p>

<p>This year, silk manufacturers in our country feel that the cocoon production is surprisingly scarce, the raw materials are thin, and the cocoon prices are not loose. The cost of silk is relatively high. The market price of Japanese silk is miserably falling, and the sale of Chinese silk in Europe is greatly affected. Moreover, since the Silk Inspection Office has been publicly measuring silk from export factories, the losses suffered by manufacturers have been huge, so that they are unable to support it. The manufacturers in Shanghai have appealed to the industry association to design maintenance and provide relief for the losses of public inspection. It is known that Chairman Shen of the Silk Factory Industry Association is now planning to schedule a meeting of all colleagues to discuss relief methods to save the downturn.</p>

Consul Gangelin stated that the French Concession Court had already made a judgment in the case, and that he had assumed the role of mediator due to diplomatic relations, so the French Concession Court had extended the execution of the cancellation of the contract by one month. He said that he was very pleased that Lawyer Gao had taken on the role of arbitrator. Mr. Gao then described to the French Consul the meeting he had with French arbitrator Mr. Yamina the day before, and explained that the case was now being resolved through arbitration rather than legal means, and that the French Concession Court had already made a judgment on the case. Lawyer Gao believed that it was a mistake for Mr. Yamina to request that an opinion be submitted to the French Concession Court. Consul Gangelin continued, saying that no matter what, it was not necessary to submit an opinion in writing to the French Concession Court. The first condition was that there be no unpaid rent and that there be a reliable bank guarantee. He requested that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company quickly provide the name of the guarantor bank, the amount of capital, the name of the bank president, and the address of the bank, and the person authorized to sign the payment, so that he could notify the three priests to mediate first, and then set a date for arbitration. Lawyer Gao found the French Consul's attitude to be sincere and took his leave.</p>
<p>Bank Guarantee: After leaving the French Consulate, Lawyer Gao visited Cai Pei, the acting Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to explain the French Consul's opinion. Director-General Cai immediately instructed Shen Zhong-yi, the acting head of the accounting department of the bureau, to handle the bank payment. However, because yesterday was Saturday and today is Sunday, the banks are closed, so it will only be possible to complete the matter tomorrow (Monday).</p>
<p>The French Opinion Has Not Arrived: French arbitrator Yamina was originally scheduled to send the opinion to the French Concession Court to Lawyer Gao today, but as of last night, it had not been delivered, perhaps because the translation had not been completed yesterday.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese in British and Dutch Colonies Enthusiastically Support</p>
<p>The private Gongshi Middle School was founded by party and national leaders such as Hu Hanmin and Wu Tiecheng to commemorate the martyrdom of Cai Gongshi. Last year, Cai's wife, Ms. Guo Jingluan, was sent to various colonies in Southeast Asia to solicit funds. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of overseas Chinese in British and Dutch colonies, a large amount of money was raised and the project proceeded smoothly. Recently, Mrs. Cai returned to China in the summer and set up a preparatory office at 13 Duofu Lane, Fuxu Road in this city. She recruited many education experts to carry out the work, and rented a school building on Hague Road to start a two-level middle school, offering both senior high and junior high classes. Mr. Chen Xueyi was appointed as the dean of academic affairs, and new students were recruited in preparation for the autumn semester. The progress was very smooth. Yesterday, the first board meeting was held at the preparatory office, and more than ten people attended, including Wang Jingqi, Xu Shiying, Huang Jiahe, and Zhou Qigang. Wang Jingqi presided over the meeting as scheduled. First, Guo Jingluan, the director of the preparatory committee, reported on the progress of the preparations. Then, Wang Jingqi, Zhou Qigang, Huang Jiahe, Guo Shouchun, and Guo Jingluan were elected as standing committee members, and Guo Jingluan was elected as the principal. A board meeting was then held to formulate various articles of association and detailed rules, appoint overseas directors, prepare to submit an application to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau for registration, and discuss the collection and management of school funds. All the items were discussed and decided in turn, and their spirit of vigorous advancement is indeed inspiring.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Requesting Exemption from Tolls and Taxes on Rice Shipments Along the Way <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Submitted for Approval by the Executive Yuan: Gospel for the Future of People's Food</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Committee previously believed that regulating the people's food supply should start from all aspects. Therefore, members of the committee investigated the tolls and taxes on rice shipments arriving in Shanghai. It was found that the regular tax for each stone of japonica and indica rice was five cents, and the tax for each stone of glutinous rice was eight cents. In addition, there were surcharges for disaster relief and education, accounting for 20% and 10% respectively. Therefore, the actual tax for each stone of japonica and indica rice was six and a half cents, and the actual tax for each stone of glutinous rice was fourteen cents. Most rice boats used bills of lading indicating 50 stones, but rice merchants paid taxes based on 80% of the actual amount loaded. However, tolls were still collected at each checkpoint, and the amount was quite large. As a result, only 30% of the fees paid by merchants went to the government. The committee believes that tolls collected at checkpoints along the way are a major obstacle to rice transportation. Each day of delay results in additional expenses. All the transportation costs, taxes, and various losses incurred by merchants are passed on to consumers, which greatly affects rice prices. Therefore, a map of tolls and taxes along the way for rice shipments to Shanghai in Jiangsu Province has been drawn. As the date for tariff reduction is approaching, tolls and taxes on rice shipments should be abolished in advance. This will not only reduce rice prices, but also eliminate obstacles along the way and allow rice boats to arrive quickly, which will greatly improve the regulation of the people's food supply. The situation has been reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for submission to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is said that the municipal government has reported the situation to the Executive Yuan for consideration.</p>

<p>Held a Research Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The factory affairs group of the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its first research meeting at the United China Association yesterday afternoon. The discussion focused on the scope of research and methods of implementation. Since the director and deputy director of the group were away on official business and had not yet returned to Shanghai, and the scope was broad and there was no prior preparation, it was difficult to make a decision on the spot. Therefore, it was decided that the secretariat of the association would send letters to each member asking them to draft a research outline and detailed items based on their own views, and submit them to the secretariat by the 29th of this month. The secretariat would then compile and send them to the deputy director for consideration and arrangement, and then schedule a special meeting of the group in advance to avoid delays. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Municipal Workers' Union Petitioned <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Nine Representatives Were Sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters. The Meeting with Committees Wu and Chen Was Very Successful.</p>
<p>The Municipal Workers' Union was alarmed by rumors that the Central Government intended to abolish the workers' union, so it jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters and sent nine representatives, including Hu Shouqi from the Calligraphy and Fan Workers' Union, Sang Yutang from the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, Zhu Xiaoyun from the Silk and Cloth Dyeing Industry Workers' Union, Hu Xiaoxiang from the Dried Goods Workers' Union, Zhao Zhaohui from the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, Weng Ruifu from the Sauce Industry Workers' Union, Yu Yaoqiu from the Taikang Workers' Union, Yang Chunfang from the Pudong Electric Workers' Union, and Cai Xiaohe from the Tea Workers' Union, to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday morning at 11:00 AM with a joint petition from all municipal workers' unions. Minister Wu Kaixian and Committee Chen Junyi received them. Committees Wu and Chen reported that the municipal party had already understood the hardships and circumstances of the workers and had already made recommendations to the Central Government. They had also raised the issue at the National Civil Training Conference convened by the Central Government, but the Central Government also recognized the need for workers' unions to exist and was considering appropriate measures. The Central Government believed that it was necessary for workers' unions to exist and was considering appropriate measures. The Central Committee immediately responded to the representatives' petition to the Municipal Party headquarters and forwarded it to the Central Committee. At the same time, the headquarters issued an order to the various workers' unions to dispel any doubts. As for forwarding the request to the municipal government to order the Social Affairs Bureau to accept and mediate labor disputes, it was immediately conveyed and more appropriate measures were being considered to ensure that workers had appropriate protection. The representatives were satisfied and left. The original drafts of their two petitions are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition 1: Regarding the request to forward a petition to the Central Government to confirm the organization of workers' unions in order to protect workers and the overall people's movement. It has been found that the Central Government recently promulgated the Law of Industrial and Commercial Guilds, the reason for which is that in order to develop commerce, it is necessary to realize labor-capital cooperation, and in order to realize labor-capital cooperation, workers must join the industrial and commercial guilds, and then they can be integrated and jointly seek the development of business. The Central Government has made great efforts to maintain the commerce of the country and eliminate the prejudices of labor and capital, for the sake of its own interests and for the sake of the future of commerce and labor, and it is compelled to speak out. I dare to express the interests and harms and respectfully present them to your committee. It is found that people have absolute freedom to assemble and associate. All those who earn a price with physical labor and mental labor to maintain their lives are workers. This is the last teaching of the Prime Minister and should be regarded as a guideline. The organization of workers' unions is in line with the doctrine and meets the requirements of the times and the environment. Moreover, the workers' union has never been behind in the revolutionary history. They all belong to the masses and belong to the same banner. Workers and merchants can organize groups. Why not workers alone? Even if it is said that employees over the age of fifteen can send representatives to participate in the guild, what about employees under the age of fifteen? Moreover, it is still a question whether the representatives they send can implement their claims in the guild. Judging from the feelings between labor and capital on weekdays, it is undoubtedly that the workers' representatives will be suppressed by the capitalists' representatives. In this way, it goes without saying that the workers' representatives have a false name but no actual power. Unfortunately, the workers feel that their status is not guaranteed, or they may jump out and follow the reactionary heresy, which would be harmful to An Ning. It is not a big deal. The facilities of the subordinate associations should be based on conforming to the doctrine and meeting the needs of the times. The subordinate associations have always taken the realization of labor-capital cooperation and the development of commerce as their premise. They only use the capitalist's deep-rooted feudal ideas, so they use revolutionary means to promote reflection. The means are different, but the destination is the same. If the organization of workers' unions is abolished, tens of thousands of workers will be wandering in the wrong direction and will not know what to do. The gains and losses are clear, and the subordinate associations cannot remain silent. I ask your committee to understand the feelings of the people and should forward the petition to the Central Government to allow the confirmation of the organization of workers' unions, so that all the workers in Shanghai can be properly protected, and labor-capital disputes can be supervised by the party headquarters and decided by the government, and there will be no out-of-control actions, which will be beneficial to labor-capital mutual assistance, commercial development, and social safety.</p>
<p>Petition 2: The petition requests approval to consult the Municipal Government to order the Social Affairs Bureau to accept and handle labor disputes involving workers' unions. The organization of workers' unions is a legal group guided by the Party Headquarters and registered with the government. However, recently, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau refused to accept the Shanghai Sauce Industry Workers' Union's request for mediation of labor-capital disputes. The Social Affairs Bureau's document No. 9344 is recorded as a report proposing to modify the conditions. Please review the contents of the petition. It is clear that when disputes occur between shop assistants and employers, the Judicial Yuan has interpreted that the Labor Dispute Resolution Law does not apply. Most of the members of the union are shop assistants. The part of the requested modification of the conditions has been reported to the Municipal Government for review and instructions. It has been ordered that the parties concerned can directly appeal to the court, etc. The affiliated associations feel that the Bureau's refusal to accept the dispute of the Sauce Industry Workers' Union is equivalent to depriving the workers' rights and losing their status of the workers under the jurisdiction of the city's workers' union, and placing the workers who use the same labor and mental effort to exchange for their price outside the exception. Now, for the sake of protecting the interests of the workers and for the sake of social safety, the affiliated associations jointly submit a petition requesting your committee to consult the Municipal Government to order the Social Affairs Bureau to accept and handle the petitions of the workers' unions in the future, which is a benefit to both the Party and the government. The petition is from the Shanghai Calligraphy Workers' Union, Taikang Food Company Workers' Union, Silk Factory Industry Joint Preparatory Committee, Shanghai Grain Exchange Workers' Union, Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers' Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, New Swire Warehouse Workers' Union, Pudong Electric Workers' Union, Steamship China Merchants Bureau Workers' Union, Su Ning Tea and Food Workers' Union, Porcelain Industry Workers' Union, Dried Goods Industry Workers' Union, Umbrella Workers' Union, Hui Guan Workers' Union, Silk Factory Industry Hudong District Workers' Union, Incense Industry Workers' Union, Silk Art Industry Workers' Union, Rice and Grain Workers' Union, China Food Company Workers' Union, Pollen Industry Workers' Union, Commercial Press Workers' Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, Jianbang Sugar and Grain Workers' Union, Shoe Industry Workers' Union, Yihe Weaving Factory Workers' Union, Silk and Cloth Dyeing Industry Workers' Union, Tea Workers' Union, Wine Industry Workers' Union, Pawn Industry Workers' Union.</p>

<p>It was previously reported that the Inland Flour Mills Association resolved to send a letter to the Flour Exchange requesting to join the standard trading situation. It is now reported that the association received a reply from the exchange stating that it would have to wait until the council meeting of the exchange before replying. It has been more than a week since then, and there has been no news. I do not know how the council meeting of the exchange went. Yesterday, representatives Li Beitao, Yang Jian, and Wang Yinqiao were officially sent to the board of directors of the exchange to meet and contact them. The director of the exchange, Mr. Zhu, met with them and said that many directors were away for summer vacation, so the meeting had not yet been held. They would be able to convene a meeting as soon as they arrived. As for the fact that the exchange was named the China Machine-Made Flour Shanghai Exchange, all machine-made flour produced within China could join the transaction and would be welcomed. The conversation was very harmonious. The representatives then asked about the names of the directors. Just as they looked up, they saw the registration certificate of the exchange hanging on the wall, which listed the names of the directors, including Gu Xinyi, Rong Zongjing, Wang Yuqing, and others, many of whom were industry giants in the flour industry. The representatives predicted that when the council meeting was convened, they would be able to get their support and left happily.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Labor Dispute in Ri Hua Cotton Mill Reported Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Side Requests Assistance and Calls for Boycott of Japanese Goods: Declaration of the Factory Labor Adjustment Committee</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ri Hua Cotton Mill Labor Adjustment Committee in Pudong issued a letter to the people of the country, saying: All fellow countrymen know that Japanese imperialists are fierce and brutal, and we do not need to introduce them again. I think everyone has long understood. This time, all of our workers in the Ri Hua Cotton Mill could not withstand the pressure of high rice prices and high salaries, and raised three universally recognized minimum requirements to the factory. However, the fierce and brutal factory did not allow any of them, which aroused a strike. The strike has been going on for more than a month, and the factory is still not aware of it. Of course, the only way we can deal with this lack of awareness is to strike permanently. Even if we starve to death, we will not resume work. The reason why we want to strike and the reason why we want to strike permanently is not because we want to strike for fun, but because we have no choice but to take this last road. However, we know that the hearts of Japanese imperialists are not the same as ours, so we have long expected that this incident will be difficult to resolve satisfactorily in the shortest possible time. Therefore, we want to issue such a declaration today. Our purpose is to hope that the fellow countrymen of the country will agree to our following requirements: (1) Give us financial or written assistance. (2) We hope that no Japanese goods will be sold during our strike. Only in this way can our strike be resolved satisfactorily in the shortest possible time. Fellow countrymen, this is our sincere hope for you from more than 3,000 people. We hope that you can earnestly accept our request.</p>

<p>Striving to Increase the Strength of the Union and Appointing Departments to Handle Union Affairs</p>
<p>The French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union held a talk with 40 workers at the union yesterday. Chairman Xu Amei briefly said that the strike has been settled and the union's affairs are about to end, but the capitalists still have the dismissal of workers' feelings, and the union will declare a warning to the higher authorities and mediators to the capitalists. But our 40 workers in the union should work hard to make the union stronger, consolidate the unity, and not let it be disorganized. As for the salary problem of our 40 workers, Mr. Du Yuesheng is responsible for it, and it is expected that there will be no mistakes. Please rest assured, everyone. If any changes occur in the middle, you can promote it to the masses and help each other. Later, temporary methods for each department were discussed, such as the entertainment department, the secretary department, the propaganda department, the supervision department, the mediation department, the organization department, the transportation department, and the investigation department. All affairs in the office will be revoked after the next executive committee is selected.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Resolution of the Tax Reporting Industry Organization Dispute <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Previously, the Municipal Business Rectification Association stated that the Shanghai Sand Boat Customs Declaration Association and the Wusong Customs Declaration Association were both engaged in tax reporting, and their nature was completely the same. In accordance with the principle of the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law that only one association is allowed in one area, it ordered both parties to merge and reorganize into the Shanghai Tax Reporting Industry Guild, and also appointed a rectification committee member. Later, the two parties believed that the industry to which they belonged was located in the Nanshi of Shanghai and the other was in Wusong. Although they were in the same urban area, the distance was relatively far, so disputes arose due to different claims on the location of the association. They were repeatedly convened and mediated by the former Business Rectification Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, but they were not resolved. The rectification committee members also delayed in taking office, resulting in the association's inability to proceed with its affairs. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened both parties again. After many explanations from Luo Qinghua, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, they each swore to take office and immediately appointed Zhu Chubaizhu Shishi Ge Zhendong and Zhou Xingshan as standing committee members to actively organize and plan to complete the organization within ten days.</p>

<p>Zhao Chongjun of the China National Products Bank, in view of the defects in the imperfect management of the insurance business in our country, previously submitted a memorial requesting the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government to establish an Insurance Administration Bureau to be in charge of its affairs. The Ministry approved that the memorial was received, and the points mentioned were insightful, and the memorial had been submitted to the department for detailed review and adoption. It is now reported that Zhao Jun, in view of the many disputes between foreign and Chinese insurance companies, is due to the imperfect supervision of the government, and has submitted another memorial urging the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to quickly establish an Insurance Administration Bureau to benefit industry and commerce and consolidate the social economy.</p>

<p>The preparatory committee of the Special Zone Citizens' United Association decided at its plenary meeting the day before to appoint another committee member to handle the request for assistance from the joint tenant associations on all roads. The members of the committee held a meeting at noon yesterday. The members of the committee, including Chu Zhongxian, Hu Fengxiang, Yu Hualong, Chen Weiwen, and Zhang Yiqing, discussed the case of assisting in the reconstruction of some houses in Qingyunli and decided (A) to publish a report to help (B) to send a letter to the Public Works Department. The text of the letter was drafted by Committee member Yu Zhongxian [T13 1]. [T13 2] The case of Wu Jianguang's shop on Nanjing Road, Shuntai, was discussed, and Zhang Xianfang, the director of the investigation department, went to the landlord, Wu Zishen, to inquire about the results of the conversation, but he did not get the point. The representative asked that if a new house needs to be rebuilt, the old tenants should be given priority to set the rent to show fairness. Mr. Wu only replied that he would discuss it. [T13 3] The case of Ruikangchang should be transferred to the full committee and has been handled in advance. The case should not be discussed temporarily. After the meeting, the special committee on foreign insurance companies' refusal to compensate Fuzhou gang's cargo was convened. Seven committee members, including Xu Yunhui, Wang Pingnan, and Yu Yangsheng, discussed the transfer of aid to Fayi by the full committee and decided to warn citizens to pay attention to foreign insurance advertisements for three days, and to warn the authorities to pay attention to the facts and deal with them impartially. Yu Hualong, Wang Pingnan, and Zhang Henghai were then appointed as members of the special issue planning and implementation team.</p>

<h3 id="e112">A Dancing Girl's Large Belly: Bitter Lawsuit in Court <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Xiuzhen Sues Zhu Mintang for Seduction, Demanding Over 70,000 Gold Pieces; Courtroom Filled with Laughter and Tears</p>
<p>Zhao Xiuzhen, a beautiful dancer from the Great Eastern Dance Hall, Zhao Xiuzhen is in her prime, with a pretty face. Although her figure is a bit thin, her proportions are just right, attracting the attention of many admirers.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiangjie, also known as Zhu Mintang, a comprador from Zhenhai, is young and good at business. He is currently a comprador for Yali Foreign Firm at 106 Sichuan Road. Last autumn, he frequented the dance hall and became involved with Zhao. Unfortunately, their good times didn't last, and their happy encounters ended midway.</p>
<p>The fruit was about to fall, but Zhao was already pregnant. Soon, she would be giving birth to a child without a father, which would be difficult for her. Zhao was unwilling to have lost her virginity to Zhu, so she hired lawyer Zhang Chongding to file a lawsuit against Zhu. Zhao's mother, Ms. Lu, listed herself as the plaintiff in her capacity as Zhao's legal guardian because Zhao was still a minor.</p>
<p>Many dancing girls were in the audience yesterday morning when the trial was scheduled to begin. The general public, especially the dancing girls, believed that this case was as important as the case of Huang Baiying and Tong Sanmao. Therefore, after 8 a.m., they called their friends and went to the Third Tribunal of the Special District Court to listen to the proceedings. The crowded situation was almost the same as when the Huang Baiying case was being heard.</p>
<p>After craning their necks for three hours, Zhao Xiuzhen and her mother arrived. Zhao was wearing a checkered red floral cheongsam, and her belly was as big as a five-stone gourd, which attracted even more attention. Presiding Judge Ge Zhiqin opened the court on time, but there were many other minor cases, and this case was scheduled last. It was not until 11:40 a.m. that this case was heard. Many dancing girls who came to listen to the proceedings did not get seats and craned their necks for three hours without showing any signs of fatigue, which showed their great concern.</p>
<p>Zhu Mintang, the defendant, did not appear. Lawyer E Sen represented him. Judge Ge first questioned the plaintiff mother and daughter about their age, place of residence, and then ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to state the grounds for the prosecution.</p>
<p>The charge of seduction was brought, and lawyer Zhang stood up and stated that the plaintiff in this case was prosecuting under Article 240, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of seducing a woman under the age of 20. The plaintiff, Zhao Xiuzhen, was a dancer at the Great Eastern Dance Hall last year. In the autumn, the defendant, Zhu Mintang, entered the hall to dance, and the two met. From then on, the defendant often boasted to Zhao about his family's wealth and said that he was not yet married and wanted to marry Zhao. At that time, Zhao was only fifteen years old and was seduced by him.</p>
<p>There was physical contact. In December, they opened room 120 of the Great Eastern Hotel and had physical contact. On January 19 of this year, the defendant checked out of the hotel room and rented a house on Muir Ming Road and moved in together.</p>
<p>Showing photos of his wife and daughter. After some time, it was learned that the defendant was already married and had a daughter. The defendant did not hide this and showed Zhao photos of his wife and daughter together. Zhao's mother had allowed Zhao to live with the defendant. At this point, she revealed to her mother that the defendant already had a family.</p>
<p>After that, he disappeared and did not come. Zhao's mother valued old-fashioned morality and believed that a woman should be faithful to one man. Now that the matter was a foregone conclusion, she could only order her to retire to the position of concubine. However, the defendant was still not accommodating and said that since he already had a wife and children, it would be difficult to marry her again. From then on, he never came to Zhao's place, so she filed a lawsuit in the Special District.</p>
<p>73,000 yuan. As for the attached civil suit, Zhao is several months pregnant, and the future education and upbringing of the child will require funds, along with all current losses and Zhao's future living expenses, etc., for a total of 73,000 yuan to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>
<p>The issue of publishing in the newspaper. Then, lawyer E stood up and stated that there was a preliminary issue in this case, which was also the direct reason why the defendant did not appear today. As soon as the plaintiff's statement was submitted, the summons had not yet been issued, and the trial date had not yet been set, but the newspapers had already published the content, which was the same as the plaintiff's statement. Who should bear the responsibility for this, the plaintiff's agent or the plaintiff? Because such a case involves public morals, not only should it not be disclosed arbitrarily in advance, but even if it is publicly tried, whether or not it should be announced is still up to the presiding judge to consider. Moreover, this case is purely the result of unsuccessful extortion. The defendant became angry and ill after seeing the report, so he could not come to court today. He then presented the doctor's certificate to the court. Judge Ge instructed lawyer E that he could directly investigate the source of the manuscript from the newspaper office regarding this point. There was no need to argue at this time.</p>
<p>The process of cohabitation. Then Zhao Xiuzhen was summoned to testify. According to her statement, she met the defendant at the Great Eastern Dance Hall in August last year. He repeatedly told me that his family was rich and unmarried, wanting me to follow him. I saw that his appearance was quite sincere and knew that he was only twenty-four years old, so I gave myself to him. We became intimate at the hotel on December 8, and on January 19, we moved to 37 Muir Ming Road. At this time, my mother also learned about it.</p>
<p>I am now eight months pregnant. Since moving in, all expenses have been provided by the defendant. He gives me an additional 150 yuan per month for the second, third, and fourth months. The defendant has repeatedly asked to get married formally, but has not done so. Later, I found out that he already had a wife and lived at 13 Lafayette Road, next door to Lafayette Fang. I have been pregnant for eight months.</p>
<p>Laughter from the audience. Judge Ge wanted to know her expression in addition to her pregnancy, so he ordered her to leave the witness stand and stand under the table for easy observation. Although Zhao had been in social circles for a long time and was used to everything, she couldn't help but blush when she heard the order in the courtroom. She had to shyly move and stand under the table. The onlookers laughed when they saw her big belly, but they immediately quieted down. Judge Ge ordered her to return to her original place.</p>
<p>Meeting with his wife. Continuing the questioning, she stated that the defendant had not come to my place since May and had not provided any living expenses, so the relationship broke down. Recently, I went to the defendant's house and met his wife. His wife is only twenty-three years old, literate, and has a good relationship with me. The defendant's parents and eldest daughter are all in Ningbo Shanghai residence, only one wife, one daughter, and male and female servants. Feeling pain and wanting to shed tears, she was asked in court whether she wanted to punish the defendant. Zhao replied that if he abandoned me, there must be a solution. If he doesn't abandon me, he should also explain. Therefore, I ask the court to make the decision. At this point, she felt something and tears were already welling up in her eyes. The judge's opinion. It was noon, and Judge Ge announced that in modern times, men and women have equal rights, and the law does not provide for the position of concubine. Regardless of whether the defendant's behavior should bear any legal responsibility, it is morally inappropriate. Now that the matter is a foregone conclusion, fortunately, the defendant's wife does not have any animosity towards the plaintiff, so there seems to be room for maneuver. The defendant is not present now and cannot proceed. He should be summoned again and the date changed to two weeks for questioning. If he still refuses to appear, he should be arrested.

<p>Supreme Court's Third Instance Judgment</p>
<p>Lin Jimu, a 20-year-old deaf-mute residing in Sanle Li, Xingjia Muqiao, native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, was found guilty of seducing a female compatriot, Wu Airong. He appealed to the Supreme Court against the first and second instance judgments sentencing him to two months of imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence. The Supreme Court has already rejected the appeal. The judgment has been delivered in the past few days. Herewith is the full text of the Supreme Court's judgment. Supreme Court Criminal Judgment No. 811, 19th Year of the Republic of China (Judgment) Appellant Lin Jimu, male, 20 years old, native of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, residing in Sanle Li, Xingjia Muqiao, Shanghai, studying typing. The appellant appealed against the second instance judgment of the Jiangsu High Court on August 28, 18th Year of the Republic of China, in a case of obstructing family. The judgment of this court is as follows (Ruling) The appeal is rejected. The number of days Lin Jimu was detained before the judgment was finalized shall be deducted from the sentence at the rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. (Facts) Lin Jimu, whose ancestral home is in Guangdong, has been living in Shanghai. He became deaf and mute due to illness at the age of three. He has known Wu Guoshi's daughter, Wu Airong, from the same village since childhood. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Wu Airong was 19 years old. During the first month of the lunar calendar that year, Lin Jimu lured her to his home and had sexual intercourse. On May 18 of the lunar calendar, he again had sexual intercourse with Wu Airong at the Da'an Hotel for four nights and then took her to his home to hide her. On May 27, Wu Guoshi met Lin Jimu on the road and asked about Wu Airong's whereabouts. Lin Jimu shook his head to indicate that she was not at his home. Wu Guoshi reported the matter to the police, who went to Lin Jimu's home and found Wu Airong and seized letters between Wu Airong and Lin Jimu. They were sent to the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution. (Reasoning) The appellant's argument is that the appellant is a deaf-mute and has no ability to seduce, and that the appellant's purpose was to marry Wu Airong and should not constitute a crime. After investigation, Wu Airong was found by her mother and the police at the appellant's home. The appellant also confessed in the first instance that he had been having an affair with Wu Airong since the first month of this year and took her to the Da'an Hostel on May 18 for two days and then took her back home. He said, "I brought her here to be my wife." The original trial also provided roughly the same information. His seduction has been repeatedly admitted. Since it was not based on proper marriage procedures, he induced a woman under the age of 20 to leave her mother's supervision and repeatedly had sexual intercourse. The original judgment found that he had continuously intended to commit adultery and seduced her. In accordance with Article 75, Article 257, Paragraph 1 (the original judgment omitted Paragraph 1), Paragraph 2, and Article 33 of the Criminal Law, the sentence was reduced by six-fifths and sentenced to two months of imprisonment with a three-year suspended sentence. There is nothing inappropriate. The grounds for appeal are untenable. However, after investigation, the original judgment did not state the standard for deducting the number of days the appellant was detained during the investigation, nor did it record the reason for not allowing the deduction. According to the provisions of Article 324, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it is obviously inappropriate and should be corrected by this court ex officio. Based on the above arguments and conclusions, the judgment shall be made in accordance with Article 408, Paragraph 1 and Article 64 of the Criminal Law. Each main text of the Supreme Court Criminal Third Division Trial President Judge Ye Zaijun Judge He Yuquan Acting Judge Liu Shoulian Huang Wenhan Luo Qizhong Right Copy proves that it is identical to the original Clerk Liu Zhenfan</p>

<p>The Meiya Silk Factory closes down, and the manager is blackmailed by letter</p>
<p>The manager of the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory in the French Concession, Tong Xinbo, who lives at No. 830 Malan Road, has recently received threatening letters extorting a huge sum of money, asking to meet at a certain place, otherwise, drastic measures would be taken. Tong reported this to the French Concession Police. Detective Inspector Jin Jiulin, detective Li Yaolong, deputy detective Mao Jingen, and detectives Zhou Yaoting and Zhou Buguang disguised themselves as the victim and went to meet. Chen Ziming, a native of Shaoxing, was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station. Yesterday, he was taken to the French Concession Court for questioning. The plaintiff complained about the previous situation and claimed that the defendant was a merchant and knew the details of the merchant because the factory had been closed down. He sent a letter to blackmail him and asked for a heavy sentence. When questioned, Chen Ziming confessed that he was 19 years old and admitted that he wrote the threatening letter and was indeed fooled by Gu Asan, who was at large, and asked for leniency. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Chen to six months in the Western prison as a warning.</p>

The wavelength is planned to use 1,500 kilohertz. The estimated construction cost is about 80,000 to 100,000 taels. All machines, etc., will be selected and purchased by Dai Le when he travels to the UK and the US in October.

<p>Construction by the Four Banks Joint Savings Society</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that the Four Banks Joint Savings Society will build the tallest Western-style apartment building in Shanghai at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Park Road. The exquisite structure will not necessarily be inferior to the new-style apartments in the United States, so it may become the largest building in the Far East after its completion. The site was purchased from Hengmao Automobile Company in May for 450,000 taels. Now its appearance is being demolished, and the company will move to the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Matt Hurst Road at the end of this month.</p>

<p>The stopping locations of the buses in Southern Shanghai along the tram tracks are generally close to the tram stops. Whenever two vehicles arrive at the station at the same time, other vehicles are blocked, which is detrimental to traffic. In view of this, the Municipal Public Works Bureau sent personnel to work with the Municipal Engineering Bureau to determine the locations where the buses should be relocated, and ordered the company to move them accordingly. Later, a deadline was set to urge the company to do so. The company then moved them according to the list, but at Laoximen, the original upward station was changed to the front of the house at No. 1438, and the downward station was changed to the front of the house at No. 1443. The company changed the upward bus to stop at No. 1465 and the downward bus to stop at No. 1458 for business reasons. After investigation by the Public Works Bureau and the Public Safety Bureau, for the sake of both traffic and business, they temporarily approved the trial operation. If it is found that it still hinders traffic in the future, it will be corrected again.</p>

<p>The high-voltage open-air switch insulator from Tiantong Road to Jixiang Road in Zhabei was previously damaged, causing a complete power outage in the area supplied by the Jixiang Road and Jiangwan substations for four hours. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company sent workers to repair it. The Municipal Public Works Bureau reported that although the failure was caused by rain and the insulator breaking, the switch had been used for a long time without inspection, so the damage to the insulator was not detected. It happened that rainwater seeped into the cracks, and the wires were burned. The company could not shirk its negligence. Therefore, it ordered the company to inspect all insulators used for open-air switches and high-voltage overhead lines and replace them immediately if they were damaged to avoid the above failure from occurring again.</p>

<p>Zhang Jingqing, the head of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Public Security Team, ordered the 17th and 18th teams under his jurisdiction to quickly patrol and suppress the large number of pirates found in Da'an Port, which belongs to Haimen County outside Wusongkou. It is now learned that Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th team of the district, led his team members on a ocean-going warship and arrived near the port at about 3:00 AM the day before yesterday. He saw a two-masted sailing ship in front of him and immediately chased after it and ordered it to stop for inspection. There were no prohibited items on board, only five men. They claimed to be hostages kidnapped by pirates. They were taken back to the Chongming team headquarters along with the sailing ship. After questioning by Captain Gong, they stated [T13]one[/T] Tian Songyuan, 50 years old, from Taiping Bridge, Rugao, transported pigs for the Tang pig customer. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at about 4:00 PM, I was kidnapped by thieves while transporting pigs and taken to the bandit ship. They used incense to burn me and told me to tell them about my family situation and property, and asked me to write a letter to my family to prepare money for ransom. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM this morning, they suddenly abandoned me and transferred me to a sailing ship to escape to the outer sea. [T13]two[/T] Liu Fubao, 45 years old, from Rugao, I am the captain of the ship. On the 14th of this month</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>I was kidnapped by thieves on the Xu Liujing sea. There were 205 pigs on my ship, which belonged to Min Da Pig Company. The thieves who kidnapped us were on a sailing ship with more than 20 bandits, all carrying guns. Tian Songyuan is indeed a pig customer.

They all claimed that at about 4:00 PM on the 14th, they were carrying 205 pigs and pig customer Tian Songyuan when they were kidnapped by a pirate ship with more than 20 pirates. They demanded ransom. This morning, the bandits heard that the police were coming to suppress them, so they abandoned us and fled. After verifying the confession, Captain Gong found that the five hostages were indeed reported by the Wusong Pig Industry Transportation Office, including hostage Liu Fubao. The dates provided also matched. He immediately prepared a document and sent the five hostages and one sailing ship to the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Provincial Public Security Team yesterday (23rd) to investigate and deal with the matter.</p>

<p>At 3:30 AM the day before yesterday, five men in short clothes were seen by Yao Dingzhi, a patrolman from the First Section of the Seventh District of Public Security, and the fourth guard post while crossing the Yunzaobang Bridge from north to south on the west end of the Outer Bund in Wusong. Knowing that they were not good people, they followed them. When the bandits saw the police, they quickened their pace, but were stopped by Huang Zhaofeng, the bridge guard. One of the bandits pulled out a handgun from his waist and shot at Officer Huang. Officer Huang bravely stepped forward, subdued the bandit, and seized a handgun and two bullets. At that time, the nearby guards all arrived. The other four bandits took the opportunity to escape. Two of the bandits fled south and were shot by the guards. Section Chief Jiguang happened to be on patrol and rushed to the scene after hearing the gunshots. He finally chased and captured the two bandits who fled south and took them back to the First Section of the Seventh District. After questioning by Section Chief Zhang, the bandit who fired the gun and resisted arrest confessed that his name was Yao Yucai. The handgun was taken from a woman in a small grocery store in Fort Baotai by Shao Zimun, who was at large, and then given to me. One is named Li Daorong, and one is named Zhang Fazhi. There is also one bandit at large named Chen Shiguang. That night, we wanted to rob a store in Wusong but failed. Our five people had previously robbed a cloth factory in Xiaodongmen, Shanghai, and obtained more than 2,000 yuan, which we divided up and spent. After verifying the confession, the section chief immediately ordered detectives Yu Peifa and Lin Zifa to search for the two bandits at large and immediately summoned Xu Chenshi, the woman in the small grocery store in Fort Baotai, for questioning. Yesterday, Yao and others were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Although the police have conducted a thorough investigation since the incident, the name of the deceased and the details of the case have not been found. It is now said that some speculators speculate that after carefully observing the age, clothing, and circumstances of the victim, she may be a factory worker, and there is a white gauze rope tied to her right arm, which is a common trinket for female workers in general yarn factories. Judging from the circumstances, it is not a case of adultery, but there is another purpose for killing her, which is to silence her. This is recorded to see what happens later.</p>

<p>Family Members Come to Testify, Luo Wenliang Apologizes in Court</p>
<p>The case of Wang Zhaohua and others using someone to fraudulently claim the compensation for the May 30th martyr Luo Wenzhao from the May 30th Family Association has been reported in previous newspapers after repeated summons by the Special District Local Court. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the hearing continued. Family members Wu Shunbao, Yang Lianchun, Wang Dan, Hua Zonghai, Tang Tiansheng, Wang Zhou, Jiang Kuiyuan, Yao Tao, Zhan Chunting, Zhu Jinshan, Jin Zhou, Tan Yuanji, Wei Guoxiang, Chen Yongxing, Zhu Longfu, Yin Zhongshu, Wu Bingxun, and injured comrades Zhang Yueqiu, Qian Shishan, Chen Baoqing, Chen Tiemei, Shen Aqi, Zhang Huizhang, Wang Ada, Zou Baishan, George Ying, Monk Mei, Shi Hualang, Zhou Renlian, and others, a total of 36 people, all came to court to testify. At 10:30 AM, Presiding Judge Ge Zhitan ordered Xu Zhijian and Luo Wenliang to appear in court. First, Judge Ge questioned the plaintiffs, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, about whether any progress had been made on the reconciliation during the one-week extension period. Hu and Xu stated that after discussing with Mr. Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the May 30th Board of Directors, reconciliation was possible, but Luo Wenliang had to publish an apology to the Family Association in the newspaper, and Xu Zhijian had to apologize to the Family Association. Judge Ge stated that the previous court hearing had urged the three parties to pay 500 yuan overseas to Luo Wen. The remaining amount could still be pursued after Wang Zhaohua and others were arrested. However, Xu Zhijian, the owner of Zhichengtai Tea Shop, replied that he was unable to pay the money. Judge Ge stated that since Xu claimed to be unable to pay, the case was difficult to reconcile. He then asked the two representatives, Hu and Chen, if the bank draft from He Lan Bank had been brought. Hu and Chen immediately produced the bank draft and presented it to the court. Judge Ge then questioned Xu Zhijian, asking if the seal on the back of the bank draft was from his store. Xu replied that it was not. He then asked if the seal on the insurance policy was from his store. Xu replied that it was, and that his daughter had it stolen and stamped on in the store. Judge Ge stated that the seal was still from his store, and that he was urging reconciliation to resolve the matter peacefully. At this point, Judge Ge asked the three parties' lawyers to discuss reconciliation among themselves. The case was adjourned until 2:20 PM when the court reconvened. After Judge Ge took the stand, he asked the three parties' lawyers if they could reconcile. Wu Chengyu, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, stated the reasons why reconciliation was not possible. Zhang Xingyuan, the lawyer representing Luo Wenliang, stated that he was unwilling to publish an apology in the newspaper, but that Luo Wenliang had already drafted a version of the apology for reconciliation. He then presented the draft for review. After Judge Ge observed that the content of the draft contained an apology, he instructed lawyer Zhang Xingyuan, saying that since Luo Wenliang was willing to apologize, he would have Luo Wenliang apologize to the two representatives of the Family Association, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, in court. Luo seemed unwilling. Judge Ge then stated that if he did not apologize, the Family Association would not give him a single penny since the procedures were correct. He then advised the two representatives, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai, to give Luo Wenliang an additional 50 yuan, for a total of 350 yuan. Hu and Chen both replied that they respected the court's decision and would comply. Judge Ge then ordered Xu Zhijian, the guarantor and owner of Zhichengtai Tea Shop, to pay 150 yuan, for a total of 500 yuan, to Luo. Xu initially repeatedly declined, claiming that the store was small and unable to pay. After Judge Ge repeatedly refuted him, Xu finally lowered his head and agreed to pay the amount. Judge Ge then ordered Luo to apologize to the two representatives, Hu and Chen, and taught him to say the eight words "I am sorry to you two." Luo then solemnly stated "I am sorry" to the two representatives, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai. Judge Ge then said that the three words "I am sorry" were even more sincere than an apology. He then wrote the reconciliation record in court and ordered the three parties to sign it. At the same time, he ordered Xu Zhijian to publish an advertisement in Shen Xinmin three newspapers, five lines each, thanking and apologizing to the two representatives of the Family Association, Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai. Xu agreed, and the court announced that the court was adjourned. At this point, the reconciliation was reached.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Continued Report on the Collision Between the Daji and Jiangjing <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The collision between the Daji and Jiangjing轮 has been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a detailed report on the true situation of the accident and the extent of the damage:</p>
<p>Location of the collision: The China Merchants Bureau's Jiangjing轮 was sailing downstream from Hankou. Most of the passengers on board disembarked in Nanjing. At 5:30 AM on the 22nd, when the ship reached Baimaisha, below Tongzhou, the river surface was narrow. The Dada Company's Daji轮 was approaching from behind, also heading towards Shanghai. The Daji船 was smaller and faster and eager to overtake. The captain of the Jiangjing船, Crowf, thought the river surface was too narrow and warned the Daji轮 to slow down for fear of danger. However, the Daji轮 continued to speed up and rush forward. When the Daji轮 attempted to pass the Jiangjing轮, the stern of the Daji轮, due to the limited space between the two ships, was unable to avoid the Jiangjing轮 and crashed into the bow of the Jiangjing轮 with a loud bang, causing the accident.</p>
<p>Extent of the damage: When the Jiangjing轮 was hit, it was just dawn and all the passengers on board were fast asleep. The sudden impact made everyone think they had run aground. Passengers in the middle and rear cabins rushed to the deck. The captain explained that it was a collision and that there was no danger, and everyone was relieved. The collision occurred on the starboard bow. Due to the force of the impact, the outer hull was damaged, and all six berths in the forward cabin were destroyed. At that time, four stokers were sleeping in the berths and were thrown from the berths, suffering head injuries and bleeding profusely. Two people on the lower level were almost crushed to death. Fortunately, there were no passengers in the cabin, so no lives were lost. The railings and iron pillars on the upper deck were also broken, with about five or six zhang of damage. Fortunately, the damage was above the waterline. The stern of the Daji轮 also had its outer hull plates dented. The damage was not as extensive as that of the Jiangjing轮.</p>
<p>What happened after the accident: After the accident, the Daji轮 arrived in Shanghai first, followed by the Jiangjing轮. Both ships reported to the customs for inspection. Due to schedule constraints, they each repaired the damage separately and will investigate the responsibility for the accident later. Yesterday, the Daji轮 was already in the dock for repairs to its stern. The Jiangjing轮 is still docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf and must wait for the engineering committee of the shipping department to inspect the ship before it can be sent to the factory for repairs. It is estimated that it will be delayed for ten days before the repairs are completed and the ship can set sail.</p>
<h3 id="e135">American Drops Notes, Commits Assault, Negotiations Ensue <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Breaks Yang Qifa's Ring Finger, Falsely Reports Armed Police Occupying Ship</p>
<p>Yang Qifa, a 32-year-old man from Yangzhou, is proficient in English. Whenever American merchant ships arrive in port, Yang would board the ship to exchange domestic notes for American notes with the Americans. He exchanged about three yuan of domestic notes for one yuan of American notes. Yang would then take the American notes to a money shop to exchange them back into domestic currency. As a result, he could earn a profit of several angles per yuan. The amount of money he earned each time was quite considerable, and Yang used this as a business. On the morning of the 20th of this month, around 10:00 AM, Yang was soliciting business on the American ship "Jinxiang," which was docked in the Huangpu River. An American man took out twenty yuan in American notes and made a deal with Yang. Yang then paid him sixty-four yuan in domestic notes. The American man complained that the amount he was paid was too little and argued with Yang. Yang said that if he was unwilling, he could return the money. The American man heard this and became furious, using force and savagery. He broke the ring finger of Yang's right hand and then stabbed Yang's right cheek with a sharp blade. Yang was injured and bleeding profusely. Yang cried out for help in extreme pain. All the notes and money he was carrying, forty yuan in large notes and forty-one angles in small notes, were taken away. At that time, Jia Tianxi and other team members of the Fourth Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team were patrolling the river and heard the cries. They immediately jumped on board the ship to investigate the cause. The American man saw the police arrive and panicked, hiding in the cabin. On the spot, the police rescued Yang and took him to a sampan boat. The boatmen there advised Yang not to make a fuss, lest he be bullied by foreigners in the future and cause trouble. Yang then went ashore, took a car, and went to a hospital near Tilanqiao for medical treatment. After the incident, the American man used the telephone to report to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, falsely claiming that a large number of armed police were occupying the American ship "Jinxiang" and requesting that police be sent to rescue them. Director Yuan immediately ordered the Water Patrol Corps to investigate. Captain Xu of the corps obeyed the order and dispatched Patrol Officer Wang to lead several police officers to the scene by speedboat. They boarded the ship and investigated, but there were no armed police in sight. They then went to the Fourth Team to investigate what had happened. Jia and other officers explained the situation. Captain Xu of the corps heard the report and, considering the seriousness of the matter, yesterday specially summoned Yang Qifa for a preliminary hearing. Yang immediately confessed the whole story. The captain believed that the American man on the ship had committed the assault, stabbed Yang, robbed his money, and then fabricated a false report, treating the police like children. The captain immediately prepared a document to be submitted to Director Yuan of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for instructions.</p>

<p>The tenants of Yile Lane on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, Shanghai, were suddenly notified that their rent would be increased by one-third.

Now, the landlord has suddenly increased the rent, and the amount of the increase is beyond what is reasonable. This disregard for the livelihood of the residents and arbitrary oppression is forcing people too far. Therefore, they convened all the tenants of the lane yesterday to form a tenants' union to discuss how to deal with the situation. They elected representatives, including Ci Xiang of the Yang Cloth Shop, Tongren Pharmacy, and residents Yong Yeyunping, Wang Qinghua, and Wang Huitang, to negotiate with the landlord and issued a declaration asking for assistance from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>The Cotton Mill Industry Workers Union Shanghai Cotton Mill Industry Workers Union Preparatory Committee warns the workers of Pu Xi's Hua Xi and Cotton Mill Workers Union: Dear workers, you are living an inhumane, animal-like existence under the oppression of Japanese imperial capitalist masters. At this time of rising revolutionary tides, it is your chance to break free from these restraints and improve your treatment. The rise and fall of labor strikes are the cries of your unbearable oppression and exploitation, and have drawn the sympathy and boundless admiration of 120,000 fellow workers in all industries in Shanghai. The workers of the Japanese-owned Hua Sha Textile Mill in Pu Dong, unable to endure the rising cost of living, have risen up to demand improved treatment and increased wages to sustain their livelihood, which is a reasonable and legitimate request. However, the Japanese capitalists have brazenly and unreasonably refused. As a result, all the workers have been forced to strike and persist in their struggle for nearly a month. The Japanese capitalists have not only refused to accept the conditions, but have also threatened to close the factory and secretly recruited new workers, plotting to resume production. The Japanese capitalists' conspiracies and malicious schemes are emerging one after another, and the workers' suffering is deepening day by day. Our union firmly believes that the impact of this strike by the workers of the Japanese-owned Hua Sha Textile Mill in Pu Dong is not only the fate of the 3,000 workers in that factory, but also the life and death of 53,000 workers in all Japanese-owned textile mills in Shanghai. The strike by the workers of the Japanese-owned Hua Sha Textile Mill in Pu Dong is a vanguard of the entire team, so our union must awaken the deep attention of all the workers in Japanese-owned textile mills, and even more so, warn all the workers of the Japanese-owned Hua Sha Mills Three and Four and Xi He Mills One and Two in Pu Xi, who have close ties with the workers of the Japanese-owned Hua Sha Mill in Pu Dong, to provide sympathetic assistance as soon as possible. If this strike fails and they still submit to the tyranny of the Japanese imperialist capitalists, then the 53,000 workers who are serving in Japanese-owned textile mills will live in darkness and have no hope for survival. Dear workers, your past failures and all the suffering you have endured are due to the lack of mutual assistance. This time, you must quickly and fully develop your instinct for mutual assistance and help each other. Do not think that the strike in one factory is the business of the workers in that factory and ignore it. No matter which factory you work in, you must regard each other as brothers. If one brother is in trouble, everyone should unite to help. Only in this way can you subdue the Japanese capitalists and achieve final victory. Let us all enthusiastically shout slogans: Unite all textile mill workers in Shanghai to jointly assist the strike of the workers of the Japanese-owned Hua Sha Textile Mill in Pu Dong to increase wages and improve treatment! Eliminate Japanese imperialist economic aggression in China! Implement the Three People's Principles! Eradicate the Communist Party! Support the Chinese Kuomintang! Support the Shanghai Special Municipality Textile Mill Industry Workers Union Preparatory Committee.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor, I recently read the news in your paper about the French Concession strictly prohibiting flower arrangement organizations, including the phrase "Wang A'er, No. 32, Fill in the words of the Eight Immortals, established a flower arrangement organization." This is actually a mistake for No. 31. I, the writer, have lived at No. 32 for many years, and the several families living here are all legitimate merchants. I am truly afraid that distant relatives and friends will be concerned by the rumors. Therefore, I am sending this letter to correct the error and hope that it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Xu Xiaoyun, August 23.</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony The opening ceremony was announced at 10 AM. After the ceremonial rites, the first speech was given by Wang Xiaohua, the chairman of the Shenyang branch, who briefly stated that today is the first day of the 13th annual conference of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. He was honored by the presence of guests from all walks of life. Due to the disruption of the Beining Railway, very few members from Pinghan have arrived. In addition, the Shenyang branch has not been re-established for long and has not been able to make sufficient preparations. He hoped that everyone would forgive him. Next, representatives from various branches reported [T13]One[/T] Jinan briefly stated that last year the branch had only 28 members, but now it has increased to more than 80. The branch affairs are very developed. Meetings are held once a week. Recently, due to local martial law, meetings have not been held for two months. Almost all engineering figures from various factories and industrial organizations in Jinan are members of the branch. The branch often plans engineering matters for local organizations and has contacted the government about obtaining a meeting place. [T13]Two[/T] Beiping briefly stated that in the past, the branch had many members, but since the capital moved south, the number of members has greatly decreased and the addresses of the members are mostly unknown. The branch directors have also mostly left Beiping and the meetings are very few. This time, many members planned to come to Shenyang to participate in the annual conference, but due to the Beining Railway traffic being blocked, very few have arrived. Some are still on the way but have not yet arrived. [T13]Three[/T] Very few members from Shanghai have arrived due to transportation difficulties.</p>
<p>Guests' Speeches First, Education Director Wu Jiaxiang read the Commander's congratulatory message. Then, Construction Director Peng Zhiqun, Education Director Wu Jiaxiang, and Northeastern University Representative Sun Guofeng, Dean of the College of Science and Engineering, gave speeches. Then, Xue Guilin, representative of the Chinese Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society and the Northeastern Mining Society, gave a speech stating that China's territory can be divided into two major parts: one is the eleven provinces and the other is the border region. Three-quarters of China's area is the border region, and the border region accounts for one-seventh of the country's population. The three northeastern provinces account for 10% of the country's area and 5% of the population. Heilongjiang is the second largest province in the country, but the population is very small. Jingbo Lake has 400,000 kilowatts of hydropower, and there are many gold mines in Heilongjiang. Today, China will change to the gold standard, so it is necessary to open gold mines. The responsibility for developing the border region lies with the engineering community. The Hinggan Mountains and Ronglu Island are being developed. Jingbo Lake has 400,000 kilowatts of hydropower, and there are many gold mines in Heilongjiang. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, a Japanese investigation team of 361 groups, with 15,266 people, entrusted Nankai School to establish the Northeast Research Association, and Tsinghua School also established the Chinese Border Research Association. Last year, the Nanjing government also sent people to the east to investigate. Russians have detailed investigations into Xinjiang, and the British have detailed investigations into Tibet. He hoped that the Institute of Engineers would pay attention to the Chinese border region and work hard to develop it. Finally, the chairman gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.</p>
<p>Matters for discussion The business meeting continued at Beiling at 2 PM. Matters for discussion: Liu Zengmian requested to compile and issue Chinese engineering books as soon as possible. It was resolved that the Institute of Engineers should contact major bookstores and notify members that all completed and upcoming works must be submitted to the Institute for review. In addition, rules for soliciting manuscripts will be set separately. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM and went to Zhongxintang Restaurant on Sanjing Road for dinner (19th). Huanhua</p>
<h3 id="e147">Chen Shizhen Concurrently Appointed as Director of the Social Affairs Department <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Gu Shusen Concurrently Serves as Acting Director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Department</p>
<p>Chen Jian, Director of the Department of Social Education and concurrent Director of the Department of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs of the Ministry of Education, has resigned. This was reported in yesterday's (22nd) newspaper. The Ministry of Education submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government to appoint Chen Shizhen, counselor of the Ministry, as Director of the Department of Social Education, and Gu Shusen, Director of the Department of General Education, as Acting Director of the Department of Mongolian and Tibetan Education. The reporter interviewed Director Chen at the Ministry. According to Chen, the scope of social education is very broad and, in a broad sense, includes the entire education system. In terms of the current undertaking of the Department of Social Education, it is people's education, so he believes that if (Social Education) is changed to (People's Education), it would be more appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate name. He feels that he is physically weak and may not be able to handle the heavy responsibilities of the Department of Social Affairs. Now that he has repeatedly resigned and has not been allowed, he has to temporarily serve concurrently and requested that Minister Jiang carefully select a social education expert to take this seat, so that he can continue to serve as a counselor.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Ministry of Education Interprets Doubts About Religious Groups Running Educational Undertakings <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zhejiang Education Department, the Ministry of Education received a report from Dongyang, Lishui, and other counties regarding the method of religious groups running educational undertakings and requested instructions. The Ministry of Education has already made provisions in the previously issued Announcement No. 7. Now, the Ministry is further explaining the meaning of the word "organization" in the second item and instructing the Zhejiang Education Department: "The Ministry has learned that the second item of Announcement No. 7 of the Ministry refers to the meaning of the word 'organization' when a religious group establishes an organization to propagate its faith. It refers to churches, temples, or societies and training centers established by followers of each religion for preaching and lecturing, with the aim of teaching religious doctrines. If they cleverly set up names to recruit school-age children to teach elementary school subjects or various miscellaneous characters, which are obviously school properties, they should follow the regulations for private schools. As for the request in the report that boys and girls under the age of thirteen should not be allowed to attend lectures in religious organizations for propaganda, it is not appropriate to explicitly prohibit this before the cancellation or amendment of the Sino-Foreign Missionary Treaty. However, boys and girls under the age of thirteen are in the period of receiving national education and should be ordered by the education bureaus of each city and county to send their fathers and brothers to nearby elementary schools to receive formal national education, so as to avoid being influenced by the doctrines of one religion at a young age when they are still shallow and have no ability to choose. Please follow these instructions and forward them to be followed."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Comparison of the Number of Elementary School Children in Various Counties in Jiangsu Over the Years <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The number of elementary school children in various counties in Jiangsu over the years has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Office for Compulsory Education has compiled the statistics of the elementary school children in various counties in Jiangsu from the beginning of the Republic of China to June of the 18th year of the Republic of China. The key points of the seventeen years are extracted below:</p>
<p>[T13]One[/T] The total number of children in each county during the seventeen years increased from 200,456 (the first year of the Republic of China) to 507,644 (the 17th year of the Republic of China), an increase of 307,188, which is two and a half times the number of children in the first year of the Republic of China. On average, the number of children increased by 8,070 per year. [T13]One[/T] The closer to the present year, the more children increased. For example, in the second year, the number of children increased by 1,111, while in the 17th year, the number of children increased by 42,057, which is almost four times the number of children in the second year. [T13]One[/T] Although the number of children generally increased year by year, the number of children increased in each year varied greatly. The increase rate was the largest in the 17th year, followed by the 15th year, the 4th year, and the 10th year. However, the number of children increased in the 5th, 8th, and 12th years was less than the number of children in the previous year. [T13]One[/T] The number of children increased every year, but in the 15th year, the number of children suddenly decreased by 78,504, which is about the same as the number of children increased from the first year of the Republic of China to the 5th year of the Republic of China. This one-year setback cancelled the five-year increase. This was due to military influence. After the military was pacified, Nanjing and Shanghai were designated as special municipalities and were no longer included in the statistics. [T13]One[/T] Comparing the situation in each county, there were 13 counties with less than 1,000 children in the first year of the Republic of China, but only Yangzhou in the 17th year. And the number of children has increased from 34 to 851, an increase of more than 25 times. [T13]One[/T] In the first year of the Republic of China, the counties with more than 10,000 children were Shanghai, Wujin, and Wuxi. By the 17th year, there were 16 counties and cities: Wujin, Wuxi, Yancheng, Nantong, Rugao, Shanghai, Jiangyin, Changshu, Yixing, Haimen, Chongming, Tongshan, Jiading, Songjiang, Taixing, and Suzhou. [T13]One[/T] In total, the county with the fewest number of children in the seventeen years was Yangzhou with 34, and the county with the most number of children was Wujin with 27,682 (excluding Shanghai, Nanjing Special Municipality, and Suzhou City). [T13]One[/T] The increase rate of the number of children is mostly faster in counties with fewer children than in counties with more children. The number of children increased more in recent years of the Republic of China than in the early years. [T13]One[/T] A special situation is that the number of children suddenly decreased by 78,504 in the 15th year. Generally, the more children there were, the more children decreased. The most severe were Wuxi, Shanghai, and Jiangning, followed by Xuhai area in Jiangbei. [T13]One[/T] The increase difference is very large. For example, comparing the 16th and 17th years, Yizheng increased by 5 children, while Haimen increased by 7,219 children. The decrease difference is also very large. For example, in the same year, Wujiang decreased by 2 children, while Taixing decreased by 9,887 children. [T13]One[/T] There was no county with only increases and no decreases in the seventeen years. For example, Rugao, Nantong, and Jingjiang (only one year decreased). There was no year with only increases and no decreases (the counties with decreases in the 4th and 8th years were relatively few).</p>

<p>Today at 4 PM. Yesterday England won all three sets straight against the United States in the singles match. Today England and the United States will have another singles match.</p>
<p>Yesterday's second act of the Rotary Cup International Tennis Semi-Finals featured doubles matches between China and Portugal, and England and the United States. The audience was still very enthusiastic. The England-United States match was considered the most important, as both countries needed to win the doubles match to secure a spot in the finals. The United States team consisted of Squire and Budge, while the English team was composed of Wheatley and Stock. Comparatively, the United States' strength was far behind. Budge was originally an experienced player, but he had just arrived in Shanghai the night before at 9 PM after escaping the summer heat in Qingdao. Not only was he exhausted from the journey, but he had also been out of practice for a long time. Therefore, his performance yesterday was extremely weak, with frequent errors and no brilliance. Squire also performed mediocrely. Wheatley of England, on the other hand, is a veteran with many years of experience and received help from Stock. They defeated the United States by a score of three to zero. The Chinese team, Zheng Zhaojia and Jiang Daozhang, faced Portugal's Canavaro and Colasa. Both sides were evenly matched and evenly matched. The match started at 4:15 PM and continued until 6:50 PM. The sky was already dark, and the lights were on, but the winner had not yet been determined. The score was two sets each, with eight games each. The match was adjourned and will be resumed today.</p>

<p>(England) Wheatley and Stock 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 Squire and Budge (United States)</p>
<p>The England-United States match started first. The United States team appeared weak from the start, especially Budge. The English team easily won three games in a row. In the fourth game, Squire of the United States served and initially showed no signs of improvement. After another failure, he worked hard to win the game. The score then became 4-1, 4-2, and 5-3. In the end, England won 6-3. In the first game of the second set, the United States won. England's momentum was fierce, and they soon won 3-1, then 3-2. England then went on to win 6-2. The third set was also 6-2. In total, England won 3-0.</p>

<p>(China) Zheng Zhaojia and Jiang Daozhang 6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3, 8-8 Canavaro and Colasa (Portugal)</p>
<p>The Chinese-Portuguese match was very intense, and the audience was extremely excited. The outcome was crucial to the overall situation. If China won, they would secure a spot in the finals. If Portugal won, the score would be 2-1, and the finals spot would depend on the final singles match. After alternating victories, China won the first two games. The Portuguese team was also strong and unwilling to fall behind. They fought fiercely, and the score soon became 2-1 and 3-3. The first set ended with China winning 6-4. In the second set, the Portuguese team gained an advantage and advanced to win 6-3. The Portuguese team's momentum suddenly increased, and Zheng and Jiang of China made more mistakes. The Portuguese team then won another game 6-2. In these three sets, Zheng and Jiang's performances were comparable, with both strengths and weaknesses. From the fourth set onwards, Jiang Daozhang suddenly appeared weak, with many self-inflicted errors. Zheng Zhaojia, on the other hand, suddenly showed his characteristics, with his net play and passing shots becoming even more impressive. In the fourth set, China lost first but then won, eventually winning 6-3, making the score two sets each. In the fifth set, both sides had to intensify their efforts, and the score was often tied, making it difficult to determine the winner. The score became 2-2, then 4-4, then 5-5, then 6-6, 7-7, and finally 8-8. The audience was captivated by the back-and-forth play. In the end, due to the late hour, a final victor could not be decided, and the match was adjourned.</p>

<p>A: I heard that your wife is seeing a doctor to lose weight because she's too fat. Has it been effective?</p>
<p>B: It's all a scam. It hasn't been effective at all.</p>
<p>A: But I saw your wife yesterday, and she seemed a little thinner.</p>
<p>B: Hmm, that's because she wasted a lot of money for nothing. She's depressed, so she lost weight.</p>

<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, a gentleman I did not know sent me a letter asking me to devise a solution to his current livelihood problems. He is currently a foreman in a sock factory with a monthly salary of only ten yuan. He has four children, and his wife cannot work because she is breastfeeding an infant, etc. I thought about it all evening and got up at dawn to draft this hypothetical plan, which seems quite feasible. It is indeed a practical problem for one person to earn ten yuan a month and try to support a family of six. Fortunately, he has not yet reached the point of having no place to stand and still has this monthly income of ten yuan, which is better than being unemployed and sitting idly by. I believe that since his wife cannot work due to breastfeeding the infant, the first solution should be to foster the child in the home of a villager for four or five yuan a month. His wife can then work as a nanny for someone else while she still has milk, earning ten yuan a month. The cost of food and lodging will be provided by the other household, which will lighten the burden. The ages of the other three children are unknown. If they are all breastfed, then, according to physiological norms, she should not become pregnant while she is lactating. The eldest child should be over ten years old and should be taken into the factory to work as an apprentice. This will provide for the child's food and lodging, further lightening the burden. The second and third children should be sent to kindergarten or fostered in other people's homes for only ten yuan a month. He can then ask the factory owner to allow him a place to sleep in the factory. This will increase his working hours and effort, and his monthly salary should naturally increase. Even in the current situation, the couple's monthly income is twenty yuan. Subtracting the fifteen yuan for the children's expenses, there should be five yuan left for savings. In case of illness, there will be enough for ordinary hospitalization. Therefore, there is no need to rent a house. Since he lives in the factory, he can concentrate on his work and consider everything his responsibility, sharing weal and woe with the factory. This will earn him the trust of the factory owner, who will promote him to an important position and rely on him. Within three years, he may become the factory director or manager. Although he may feel sad about the temporary separation from his family, he will not have the worry of six mouths starving and freezing. With the burden eased, he will have the hope of advancement in three years, and his spirits will be lifted. Even if he remains in his old position, his salary will naturally increase with his service. After three years, he should be able to earn at least ten yuan more per month, and he will have savings for education expenses. Life is about being content with one's circumstances and living within one's means. Why should he end up like a wandering minister of Chu, starving his wife and children? If his wife is unwilling to work as a nanny, then one loom in the home and the two children can cook together, and they will not be in a desperate situation. However, this will be much more laborious than the ease of working as a nanny. I am afraid that if they become slightly more comfortable, and she gives birth to a fifth child, they will return to their original state, only increasing their burden and suffering. I must do my best to advise people, so I offer this additional advice. I cannot remember the gentleman's address, so I am writing this in my notes and sharing it with others who have similar problems.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Tragic News of Suicide in West Lake <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>He committed suicide in frustration after failing to obtain a government position and being scammed out of borrowed money.</p>
<p>Recently, people in Shanghai, faced with the pressure of life or changes in their love life, have often resorted to jumping into the Huangpu River as their final destination. The sadness and misery of the situation, with life being treated like a feather, is truly lamentable. Unexpectedly, this trend has recently spread to Hangzhou. In that scenic and tranquil place, someone recently committed suicide by drowning in West Lake. After sighing, I secretly wonder why the beautiful and gentle West Lake has suddenly turned into a ferocious beast devouring people. I will now describe what I have heard:</p>
<p>A man named Tang, from Sheng County, graduated from a certain middle school. However, he was naturally pedantic and did not know how to produce anything. He spent his days reading and chanting, which led to the decline of his family's wealth. Recently, he became obsessed with officialdom and heard people say that becoming a county magistrate was easy and a shortcut to making money. He wrote a letter to a friend in Hangzhou, Mr. Jia, asking him to help him get a recommendation. Jia was working in a certain agency in Hangzhou. After receiving Tang's letter, he knew that Tang was foolish and could be deceived. A few days later, he sent back a letter falsely claiming that he had taken care of everything and that Tang had been appointed as the county magistrate of Lin'an County by order of so-and-so. He asked Tang to quickly raise a certain amount of money and bring it to Hangzhou so that he could take office. Tang was overjoyed upon receiving the letter. He hurriedly raised money to entertain. He gave Tang a list and said that he had paid a certain amount of money on his behalf. Tang gave him the money. Jia also produced a fake letter of appointment. Tang, not knowing what to do, took it to the designated office. He found out that there was already a county magistrate in the county and that there had been no transfer. Tang realized that he had been deceived. He quickly returned to Hangzhou to find Jia, but he had disappeared. Filled with anger and frustration, he thought that he had no face to see Jiangdong again and had the sudden impulse to end his life. He hired a boat from the Lakeside to the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and drowned himself. Alas, how unjust!</p>
<h3 id="e166">A Record of Decorative Thieves in Paris <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yuying</p>
<p>Paris, the capital of France, is the birthplace of the world's new fashions. Each well-known new fashion company employs experts who painstakingly work to create various ingenious and artistic clothing. People all over Europe and the United States compete to imitate them. However, recently there has been a discovery of decorative thieves who steal their new designs and make copies. The impact on the business of the new fashion companies is not small. Now what is a decorative thief, let me introduce it as follows:</p>
<p>Most of the so-called decorative thieves are Americans. They frequently visit various new fashion companies in Paris, and all of them are acquainted with each other. Over time, these people came up with a strange idea. If they see a new design of clothing displayed in the window, they immediately draw it as a register. They then rush to London, New York, Hollywood and make copies in the same way. They boast about how new the styles are and how well the sizes fit. Relying on these new outfits, the profit is tripled. By the time representatives from new fashion companies bring new outfits to these cities, their business has already been taken away by these people. The new fashion companies are concerned that if this continues, they will suffer immeasurable losses. They then banded together to find ways to deal with the problem. However, everyone can imitate the styles of new clothes. Therefore, they cannot prosecute these people by law. Then they had to seek passive resistance, and the new fashion companies in Paris put up signs on the decorations of each store, saying "Imitating our new clothing styles is the same as stealing. Customers who want to see the new clothes, please come inside. We cannot put the clever new clothes in the window, for fear of being imitated by decorative thieves." As a result, various new clothes no longer dared to be displayed as window decorations and were hidden in the inner room. Even if there were decorative thieves who did not know better and asked to see the new clothes, hoping to imitate them, they were rejected. Only distinguished customers were allowed to see the truth. From then on, the decorative thieves had nowhere to apply their skills.</p>
<h3 id="e167">On Xun Huisheng's Records <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— She Yu</p>
<p>Bored during the long summer, I use records to pass the time. I have compiled a list of Xun Huisheng's records released by various companies, as well as those that have not yet been released, with criticisms attached. Pathé Records has three records: "Yu Tang Chun," "West Lake Lord," and "Fanjiang Pass Intoxication." "Drunkenness" is the best of these. Gaoting Records has three and a half records: "Filial Piety Festival," "Hongni Pass," "Stabbing Tang Mu," "Tianwang Yu Tang Chun," and "Hongluan Joy." "Yu Tang Chun" has the most complete sentences and is the most coherent. "Mu Tianwang" is the best at conveying the thoughts of the lines. Beikai Records has seven records: "Liu Rushi," "Hairpin Phoenix," "Yu Tang Chun," "Hongliu Village," "Little Shepherd Boy," "Fragrant Silk Belt," and "Danqing Yin." ("Danqing Yin" has not yet been released. It is a four-line Xipi slow board, with a new, stable tune, achieving a moderate and upright style.) Among them, "Little Shepherd Boy" is the best-selling. Also, the lyrics and melody of "Hairpin Phoenix" are unique, integrating Kunqu opera, similar to string music, and quite pleasant to listen to. The company's legal collection and production can especially enhance its color. Victory Records has three records: "Wandering Tears," "Iron Bow Marriage," "Lantern Riddle," and "Jealous Wife." (Recently, they have continued to collect three records: "Geng Niang," "Thirteenth Sister," "Lantern Riddle," "Pansi Cave," and "Hairpin Phoenix." Their sample pieces have all been listened to. "Geng Niang," "Lantern Riddle," and "Hairpin Phoenix" all use the best two-six of the anti-Xipi. The collection and production is also better than before.) "Iron Bow Marriage," "South Bangzi," and "Wandering Tears Erhuang" are the best of these. Kaiming Records has three records: "Gou Guanniang," "Geng Niang," "Fish Algae Palace," and "Treasure Chest." ("Treasure Chest" has not yet been released. The sung Siping tune uses many unusual peaks in the ups and downs.) "Fish Algae Palace" and the lines of "Xun Guanniang" are the best of these. This company was established later, and its collection and production also have advantages. The sound is high and bright, and there seems to be no damage to the film quality. Dachina has six records: "Thirteenth Period," "Hongluan Joy," "Yu Tang Chun," "Cuiping Mountain," and "Drunk Spilling to Relatives' Homes." "Bang Da" is best in narration, and Cuiping Mountain is spiritually satisfying. His speech when visiting relatives and family is clear. He has achieved the effect of banner women who were very adept with the language. I put Yu Tang Chun together and the set is now complete with works from Baidai, Beikai and Gaoting. In summary, Hui Sheng has a total of fifty-seven records to date, including those that have not yet been released. I am recording this for the enjoyment of fellow record enthusiasts.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Origins of the French Concession in Shanghai (Part 1) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ping, translated from the North China Herald Weekly</p>
<p>The first foreigners to come to Shanghai were not French. It was not until 1847, when the Frenchman Montigny came to Shanghai as the French consular representative, that the French had a presence. At that time, business was quite slow, and there were only a few Catholic priests stationed here. Montigny was a man of talent and made many plans for French enterprises in China. Not long after his arrival in Shanghai, the first Frenchman came here to do business. This man, named Remy, was in the business of clocks and watches and foreign wine. After his arrival, the French Consul Montigny asked the Chinese authorities to grant a piece of land to the French. Montigny was deeply concerned that the small French businesses would be overshadowed by British and American businesses. The Chinese government granted a small piece of land. On May 18, 1862, the French Municipal Council was established, with Edan Moore as consul. At that time, the British consul opposed the establishment of the French Municipal Council because it was inconsistent with the Shanghai Land Regulations signed by the treaty countries and the Chinese government. But the French ignored it. At that time, all foreign businesses in Shanghai were in the British Concession. The newly established French Municipal Council had a small annual income. The 1865 budget estimated that the total income would be 103,000 taels of taxes. However, 48,000 taels of this came from license taxes from opium dens, brothels, and gambling houses. At that time, brothels and gambling houses in other concessions did not require licenses or pay taxes. Litigation in the French Concession was also handled well. However, one incident is enough to prove that the French were unwilling to cooperate with other concessions. In 1865, an American was murdered by a Frenchman on a British ship. The ship was docked in Ningbo. The British did not request a trial. The French Consul did not notify the American Consul when questioning the murderer. Perhaps he would have presented evidence. After the interrogation, the murderer was released. The intention of the French authorities in Shanghai was to recognize the French Concession as a permanently ceded territory. The French Consul General was the head of the concession. The Municipal Council was merely an advisory body directly under his jurisdiction. The French Municipal Council had no real power. This can be seen from past events. Whenever the Municipal Council disagreed with the Consul General, he would resolutely dissolve it. The police and volunteer corps were also under his jurisdiction to protect it. The current Consul General is Mr. Gao Zhai Lin.</p>
<p>When Montigny asked the Chinese government to cede land, the power of French Catholicism was gradually stabilizing. The cathedral was built in Xujiahui. The priests also built residences there. They have not been moved to this day. At that time, Chinese officials believed that the harm of Catholic forces to the country was far greater than the opium and merchants in the French Concession. The officials were very angry about this. The church was robbed, and many priests were killed. There was a convent in Xujiahui that did relief work. At that time, superstitious Chinese people threw stones at its windows and broke into the door, threatening them with death. As a result, relief work could not be carried out smoothly. The Xujiahui Catholic Church ran an orphanage. As a result, there were also martyrs. At that time, the Chinese did not know what the French were trying to do. Today, the orphanage houses hundreds of homeless children and teaches them the best crafts.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Sows Fortune and Gains a Diamond Ring? Only This Predestined Relationship Inspires a Song of Golden Threads.</p>
<p>In the past, when women who had married returned to the stage, there was often one condition: they were not allowed to use their former names. It was as if they had given their bodies to him, and even their names belonged to him. If they were divorced and returned to the stage, they could no longer use their old brand. This seemed to be a matter of face. In reality, the cicada shedding its shell and moving to another branch still makes the same noise. Forbidding the use of the old name seemed like a self-deceiving act. Therefore, later on, people didn't bother with it so much. Some women who remarried and returned to the stage often hated the mercilessness of the anvil. They deliberately embedded the surname and name of the man they married into their flower banners, such as marrying someone surnamed Yu and calling themselves Yu Ji, or marrying someone surnamed Xie and changing their name to Xie… and so on. However, they thought that there were many concubines, like swallows on the beams, let them come and go as they pleased. It was just the way things were, and there was nothing strange about it. But there was a type of woman who, after marrying someone and coming out again, actually had a better life than before, with the feeling of ascending the dragon gate and increasing their reputation tenfold. Especially the concubines of wealthy people; if they ever came out again, it would cause a sensation. Marrying a wealthy person seemed to give them a new glorious title. The more titles they had, the more their reputation increased, like the politicians of recent times. They were officials during the late Qing Dynasty, and they are officials during the Republic of China. They are in the limelight under the warlord government, and they are in the limelight under the National Government. To the guests, they are like palace ladies from the Tianbao era, hearing about the Kaiyuan era. They also know that the wealthy man's favorite would not dare to neglect them. Therefore, Zuo Shichen asked, "So, Cuiyun has come out this time..." She said shyly, "It's not good." She said she didn't have many old customers. She said it was embarrassing to see the old customers. The day before yesterday, she said to me, "Ah Bao, if you see so and so, please give them a message for me." I said I hadn't bumped into them on the stage. Today is very coincidental, I bumped into you. Are you the host here? You are an old friend of Third Sister. Please help her. Burning incense should be done in a ruined temple." Ah Bao's series of words left Zuo Shichen speechless. Seeing that the gambling ticket of Jiao Chan Nong had been issued, she went to the neighboring seat to socialize with the guests. In less than three minutes, she ran back and said, "Third Sister is coming. Tell her that Ah Bao from Zuo Cuiyun has been here. I have several stage performances and can't wait for her any longer." With that, she took the young gentleman and left. Ten minutes later, Cuiyun, who had changed her name to Chan Nong, came. When Zuo Shichen saw her, he couldn't help but be shocked, thinking that he hadn't seen her for only three or four years, how could she have aged so much? Zuo Shichen almost shouted "Ah ya!" He thought that her age was at most twenty-four or five years old. Could it be true what people say about the age of a beauty, that ten years is a lifetime, from fifteen to twenty-five years old, she has already entered the period of decline? But I have seen people of twenty-four or five years old who are as youthful as girls of eighteen or nineteen.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Gold Price Re-Enters the Sixty Taels Mark <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Silver Market Shows Signs of Continued Decline; Market Demand is Dense</p>
<p>The trend is quite active, and short sellers are forced to cover their positions. Yesterday, the benchmark gold continued its high peak trend, the market situation was swift and sharp, and the price of over 560 taels had already occurred. The price in the morning only fluctuated by one or two taels, but from morning to noon, there were a total of fourteen or fifteen taels of fluctuations. The exchange rate has been reduced by half a gear, and the internal situation is also tight and high. Major investors are bravely buying, and some foreign merchants are speculating and eager to cover their short positions, such as Yuanxing, Yonghong, and Yili, etc., have all taken action to buy. Wanxing, Shunli, Taikang, Run, and retailers have generally sold. Since the silver market was reduced in the morning, it was seen to rise. The market was very strong in the afternoon, especially showing its strength and frequently rising into the sky, exceeding the 50 taels mark. Later, it was heard that the silver market showed signs of continued decline because Mumbai intended to sell. The industry got this rumor and the buying sentiment from all parties became even stronger. The general short sellers were greatly stimulated and had to enter. Because the exchange rate was tighter, people's hearts were firm, and they suddenly rushed out of the 60 taels mark, with the intention of soaring. As a result, the price was between 62 taels.</p>
<p>The price rose steadily, rising a total of 14 taels and one cent. Yesterday, the large bars were all reduced by .0625, the silver price was reduced by .375, the exchange rate was not changed. The initial opening price of gold for October was 547 taels and 7 qian, plus 1 qian, then 7 taels and 56 qian. Later, Yuanxing, Yong, etc. competed to buy, and the price jumped 56 taels to 53 taels and 34 qian. The month's Dalian price was sold from Taiwan at 1 tael, 2 qian and 5 fen, 5, and there were a few retailers sold on the counter, so it was reduced by 2 taels. After the announcement of the first shilling, it was already reduced by .125, the US dollar was reduced by .25, and the Japanese gold added 1 fen, so it rose to 52 taels and 67 qian. Then, 7 qian was cut off, calculating 52 taels, but the English gold, etc., were increasingly strong, and the bank was doing 9 months at 7 pence 4375. Korea came out near Dalian at 1 tael, 2 qian, 5 fen, 875, and in November, English gold was sold by McCallie Mitsui, etc., at a price of 7 pence and a half, and because Yili Yuanxing, Yong, etc. were very brave in buying, it rose to 54 taels and 3 qian. After entering, Taikang Run, etc. sold it to 10:00 at 51 taels and 7 qian. Afterwards, the supply exceeded the demand, and the short sellers were extremely panicked and eager to enter, especially as news came that India was selling silver ingots, etc., and suddenly heard that the market sentiment was extremely sharp and soared into the sky, and has already soared by a huge 10 taels. At 11:30, it had already penetrated the 60 taels. At noon, it was calculated to reach 62 taels. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 61 taels and 7 qian, and then it was pulled up 2 taels to calculate 64 taels. Because today is Sunday, the market is closed, so the short sellers had to enter, which is 14 taels and 1 qian higher than the day before yesterday. It was found that the maximum price in half a day was 62 one meat, and the minimum price was 47 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 14 taels and a half. The asking price has been changed to 615 taels. Because the hanging is one cent bigger, the initial press was 63 taels to 61 taels, and the noon closing was only suppressed by a small 53 taels. The registered books for August and September are 73 taels, October is 62 taels, the supplementary water is 73 taels, and the physical goods opened early at 48 taels and 2 qian, and the noon closing was 64 taels. The market was closed in the afternoon because it was Saturday as usual.</p>
<p>Trading was busy, and there were different entries and exits for hedging. The various firms were quite enthusiastic in buying and selling. Yuanxing, Yonghong, Yili, Yuxiang, Xieyu, Xiangfeng, Yongfengyuan, Taiyuxingyong, etc., all had purchases. Yuankang, Xiangtaikangrun, Shunliwanxing, Yuanda, Yongyuanhengjiu, Taichengfengyong, etc., had all sold. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyongzhifeng, Yongyidafeng, Yonghengxingyuancheng, and Yong, etc. sometimes entered and exited. Yuancheng, Senchangyong, etc. first went out and then entered. All the short sellers had to painfully make up their positions. Also, there were different entries and exits for the hedging slips. The Dalian gang sold more than 2,000 slips and entered 1,000 slips. The Guangdong gang had a calm attitude and only did a small number of transactions on behalf of customers.</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Exchange Rate is Reduced by Half a Notch <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Inner Disk Shows Strength; Indian Merchants Resist Shorting English Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was Saturday, and the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day in the morning as usual. The HSBC rate has been reduced by half a notch because the silver market has shrunk. The English gold was reduced by .125 to one shilling and seven pence .125, the US exchange rate was reduced by .25 to 38 yuan .75, the Indian exchange rate was reduced by .75 to 107 rupees, the French franc was reduced by 6 yuan to 987 yuan, the German exchange rate was reduced by 1 yuan to 162 marks, the half and foreign currency was reduced by .75 to 96 shields .25, the slope exchange rate was increased by 12 taels to 145 taels .25, the Hong Kong exchange rate was reduced by .25 to 83 taels .25, and the Japanese exchange rate was increased by 1 fen to 1 tael 2 qian 7 fen and a half. The three English, American and Japanese exchange rates in the domestic market were also tight and followed closely. The gold market was seen to return to its peak, exceeding the 560 tael mark. People's hearts were extremely high, and the big bars might fall again, causing more than ten taels of excitement. The exchange market has a related relationship, especially the Chinese merchants in the gold industry are entangled. It is estimated that more than 100,000 pounds of English gold have been sold by banks such as Sumitomo, East Asia, McCallie, Mitsui, and Xingye. However, a small number were sold at noon, and the East absorbed them. Also, the Indian merchant Qiao Rifu also resisted the short, and the various banks did tens of thousands of pounds to each other, and more than 100,000 yuan was settled by the Zhengjin bank. However, Japanese exchange transactions are not frequent, only the current Dalian ticket continued to enter tens of thousands of yuan, which was sold by Taiwan and Korea. The result of the exchange rate is that the English gold is reduced by half a pence, the US dollar is reduced by .9375, and the Japanese exchange rate has increased by more than three points. The market sentiment has presented a sharp and beautiful phenomenon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend of US cotton was still weak, and the local cotton market continued to stabilize. Because most people psychologically believe that the decline can be declared over, there are still many people who buy in to do more. In addition, the price of gold has risen again, and people's hearts are more cheerful, but according to the actual situation, it is still pessimistic. It is estimated that the new cotton of each road is being carried out well. If there is no change in the weather in these two weeks, the year can be expected to be a bumper harvest, so the Han gang also has the idea of ​​selling short when the price rises.</p>

<p>New York telegram on the 22nd reports the cotton market situation for the week: The cotton price fell low in the initial stage of this week. Because the actual situation has increased, the market price has rebounded, but the rebound is weak. The demand has shrunk. There have been continuous showers in several cotton belt areas, and Oklahoma has received timely rain, but the rainfall in Tulsa is still insufficient. Some people believe that the eastern cotton production in Alabama has increased, but the cotton production west of the state has decreased since August 1. There is no definite grasp on the situation of cotton production at the end of August and the increase or decrease in figures. Generally, the opinion seems to be that the expected cotton production may not decrease. The short party believes that the numbers shown must be below 14 million bales to stimulate general buying when new cotton is gradually increasing on the market. The weather is hot and the cotton is harvested early. Colleagues expect that the new cotton on the market will suddenly increase as a result, and more people who sell short can immediately be absorbed. This kind of doubt is the basis for predicting that the market price will be lower. Some of the recent cotton in the southwest is said to be needed to cope with Chen Hua's contract. Inside and outside the garden, colleagues have slightly purchased. Although the current popularity is waiting and watching, it is much more direct than before. Some cotton merchants anticipate that the power to resist prices will be greater, but the short party's arrogance is still quite fierce.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the current price has attracted the attention of some yarn factories. There is a slight accumulation of long-term contracts in the south, but the movement of new flowers on the market in the future, the limited short-term demand, and the general state of commercial decline are now obstacles to speculative purchases. Rain has been seen in many places in the southwest, but the rain in Texas and western Oklahoma is small and not universal and not sufficient. The market popularity is sometimes trending towards the short side. The weekend statistics are listed on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>

<p>The Rice Market Continues to Trend Downstream</p>
<p>The source arrived in Zhabei yesterday and the market sales were not good. The local stores were rich, the production market was frequently soft, and the buying appetite was weak. Broken geng was continuously weak for 2 corners, and the top geng fell into the 21 yuan. The Dongxin geng in Guannei turned sharply downward, and the sales were dull. It was also short by half a yuan to open 18 yuan and a half. The price of Bo Rice, which was seen to arrive, was also eagerly soft, and the high-priced goods opened at 20 yuan and 8 corners. The source of new sharp customers continued to arrive, and this cargo was quite cheap to divide the Shen, so the big market went downstream every step. Yesterday, the market only opened at about 14 yuan, and the speed of the decline was unexpected. Bai</p>
<h3 id="e181">Foreign Rice Sales Stagnant, Market Weak <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained weak, and due to stagnant sales, a turnaround was difficult. However, Tianjin, which had been under strict prohibition of shipments for a long time, suddenly appeared in the market with 300 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, priced at 16 yuan. This rice was reported to be loaded for export to Tianjin on the same day. Since the Tianjin merchants have the appetite for it, the market seems poised for a turnaround. However, the rice market in that area has long been dominated by Japanese merchants and Saigon direct shipments, resulting in low prices, leaving no foothold for Shanghai merchants. Therefore, trading is difficult to increase. This shipment seems to be a trial run. Moreover, the quota for the opening of the Shanghai rice market is very large, and it is rumored that a small number have already been shipped in advance from Saigon. In addition, there were transactions in rural areas, with 300 bags of Mindang rice priced at 15 yuan and 2 jiao, 300 bags of small Jiaoci rice priced at 14 yuan and a half, and 300 bags of Kekan rice priced at 15 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.</p>

<p>North Sales Disappointing, Small and Medium Factories Unleashed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the flour market in the morning was very good, and this month was a focus for the bulls. The opening price remained stable, but small and medium factories sold foreign wheat, and prices were reported down by two or three jiao, which inevitably affected sentiment. Hengda Factory remained optimistic and expanded its defense, with even better intentions than the bulls close to the large factories. However, it was heard that the Northern merchants directly ordered 500,000 bags of foreign flour, which further disappointed the North, leading to a softening of sentiment. At the close of the market, this month was down by five li, and November, December, and January were each down by two and a half li.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the current month was stable due to bullish buying, while the distant months were pulled down by foreign wheat. The Northern merchants had already concluded a large number of foreign flour transactions, further shaking sentiment, and the bears' intentions strengthened. Although the buyers tried their best to support the market, it was still difficult to gain a foothold. As a result, August and September were down by two fen, October and January were down by three fen, and December was down by one fen. Spot wheat factory processing remained good, and there were purchases for transfer of current month futures, so the market improved and prices rose slightly by one or two fen. More than 6,000 bags of wheat were reported to be shipped from Taierzhuang, Xuzhou, Yaowan, Liuhe, Jiangyan, etc.</p>

<p>Anhui Dried Cocoons Opening Prices Look Weak</p>
<p>Affected by Japanese cocoons invading the market, prices are generally falling by four to five liang.</p>
<p>This year, the spring and summer cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were poor, and the raw materials were scarce, so the cocoon prices rose. The prices of Anhui dried cocoons were also lively. However, after a large number of Japanese cocoons were shipped to Shanghai at low prices, the Chinese cocoons were greatly affected. Yesterday, Ding Yu Jin Datong sold 185 dan of spring dried cocoons inside the port for only 155 liang (640 jin, converted), a drop of four to five liang compared to before. If more Japanese cocoons continue to be shipped to Shanghai, the Anhui cocoon market will become even weaker.</p>

Meanwhile, the East Exchange rate has been falling frequently, reducing costs sharply. Therefore, the holders' intentions are relaxed, and many are selling at tea parties. Thus, the downstream price per sheet is 9 qian and 1.5 fen (6 chi) and 1 liang and 1 qian and 4 fen (7 chi), a drop of three to four fen compared to last week's prices. It is heard that Changjiang Road is selling very well, and the demand from inland Fujian and other merchants is still strong, so the market is not too depressed. According to people in the industry, there are still more than 20,000 sheets of spot goods to arrive this week, so the market outlook is difficult to be optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Recent German Literary Scene <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Most of the novels recently published in Germany can be classified as social novels, because these works describe various aspects of German social life after the end of the Great War. They can serve as a very useful index to the latest trends in modern German thought and morality. In such novels, the issue of relationships between the sexes naturally occupies the first place among the themes used by writers.</p>
<p>Stefan Zweig’s recent work is also like this. Es Ist Zeit is the latest installment of the Roland novel series. The central figure, of course, is still Roland, as in the previous installments. Although this novel series is too long and too complex, it is a detailed record of German intellectual and social life since the European War. This latest installment writes about a kind of reaction that has recently occurred in Germany, a reaction against the Futility faction and the moral laxity of young people. Originally, Germany, since the Great War, has suffered the humiliation of enemy occupation of important cities. A group of young people are mostly spiritually decadent, grief-stricken, and desperate, thus giving rise to a decadent and cynical attitude of "a merry life while life is here." Thus, the so-called Futility Doctrine was created. This kind of doctrine was once very popular in Germany, but recently, as Germany's vitality gradually recovered and the spirit of the nation gradually rose, there was a very powerful resistance to this self-abandonment and willingness to fall. Zweig's new work writes about the struggle between these two factions. This novel is not only a very interesting social snapshot, but also contains a shocking criminal plot: an old rake, who is very influential in the upper middle class and has committed many evils against the young girls in this social stratum, is murdered. Suspicion of murder falls on a young writer. Although this young writer is also a member of the Futility faction and seems to be a comrade of the old rake, he is still suspected of murder because he once openly denounced the old devil's crimes and said that the old devil's death could rid society of a scourge. Most of this novel narrates how this suspicion hangs over him, unable to be shaken off, but later a girl who has already escaped is proven to be the real murderer, so he is acquitted.</p>
<p>Heinrich Mann, Thomas Mann's older brother, is also an old writer. He has recently published a collection of short stories entitled Sie Sind Jung, in which several stories are about the experiences, interests, strengths, and weaknesses of young German men and women. The best one is about a married man who is morally lax and hypocritically treats everything. Who knows, later his son also uses this kind of unrestrained hypocrisy to deal with him. This short story is terribly strong.</p>
<p>Hans Sochaczwewer, the author of Menschen Nachdem Kriege, appears to be a young man from his writing. This book presents two kinds of Germans in contrast, these two kinds of Germans who have gained their different views on life after the Great War, a kind of model in which all his ideals have been shattered and his patriotism has been overturned. Although his family life is relatively peaceful, even this cannot prevent him from feeling that being a human being is meaningless. The other type is his friend, who is completely different from him, who regards Germany's defeat and revolution as the beginning of a new book, feeling that there is still a good sequel for his country or for himself personally. He lives in peace and contentment, working as a screenwriter and having a romantic affair with a young Romanian woman. The book writes his character very well. This book is not a mature work, but it is worth reading.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Historical Novelist Walter Von Molo <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Walter Von Molo does not act as a historical novelist in his new book, Die Scheipung. He abandons the historical themes he had previously used to great success and instead uses divorce as a theme. This novel is an interesting study of an unhappy marriage that is ruined by the wife. She cannot adapt herself to her husband's temperament and finds that having children can provide more helpers to oppose her man. She believes that marriage is only a temporary union with no special responsibilities or obligations. This is her own assumed theorem, but she then acts according to her theorem. From the lines of this novel, it seems to be in favor of monogamy. From the point of view of its expression of social trends, it can be compared with Zweig's novel. However, both in form and style, this novel is far inferior to Zweig's new work.</p>
<p>Rudolf Borchardt's new book, Dao Hoffnungslose Gescht, is a collection of short stories entirely on the subject of relationships between men and women. The longest one is actually a male study. This man is marrying for special purposes, written very exquisitely and interestingly, reminiscent of Henry James, who focuses on technique, and the style of writing is very mature. This is not beyond everyone's expectations, because Borchardt is one of the best writers in modern Germany and is highly regarded in his own country, but not many people know him abroad. However, writers of similar status to him</p>
<p>Bruns Grank is very famous abroad. His long short story PoliticalNovelle satirizes the famous French diplomat Briand, and especially caused a sensation in Europe and the United States. His recent work Der Magier is also a novella. The magician mentioned in the title is a stage director, a genius in directing dramas. After his successful performances in Austria, he suddenly disappeared, and it is said that he went to somewhere in the United States to perform the surprisingly talented Negro drama. This novel is also well written, and Frank's strengths are revealed.</p>
<p>The Experimental Female Writer</p>
<p>Ｖicki Baum is a new writer who has recently caused a sensation in Germany. She is not only a believer in realism, but also a practitioner of experimentalism, because before writing her latest novel, Menschen inHotel, she went to a hotel in Berlin to work as a waitress for six weeks in order to obtain the truth of life in a large hotel. There are very few writers as sincere and patient as she is. The background of this novel is a large hotel in Berlin, Germany. The characters in the book are all guests in the hotel. After the publication of this novel, it was a great success and was even adapted into a drama, which was performed in Berlin and then in Vienna and other major European cities, so Wang Jibao immediately became a popular writer. She is a trained musician and the wife of the bandleader of the Berlin National Opera House, and has traveled alone to North Africa on a sex adventure.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Confessions <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wenzhi</p>
<p>By Guo Zixiong</p>
<p>In fact, which young person in this era would not be attacked by depression? To be honest, unless they are generally slow-thinking and numb-nerved, they will not be affected by the arrival of depression and only know how to live a numb life in a muddle-headed way. If there is such a thing as inspiration in the world, then the depression of young people can never be eliminated and will often grow. This is really because the desire of young people to move upward is too high. However, what we require is that in the progress of life, although we encounter environmental obstacles, oppression, and constraints, and feel pain and boredom, the will to survive must be strong, and we must struggle at all times and fight at all times in the vortex of pain and boredom. Struggle to fight the forces of obstruction, oppression, and restraint, fully exert the requirements of life, and seek victory. Only in this way can the meaning of valuable life be reflected in literary and artistic works, which is the work we need. However, when we turn to works that express this kind of modern young people, we are all disappointed. Most of them are just a kind of listless and decadent unconscious cry, just venting the anger in the heart and expressing dissatisfaction with the status quo, without the ambition to move towards the light. This kind of cry only forms a moan, nothing more than a dry cry of a defeated soldier who is afraid of battle. It is still far from the field of literature and art.</p>
<p>This book "Confessions" is also a work of this kind of injury in the mold. In order to endure the urging of the soul, tonight I want to draw a flower autograph in front of you, a confession (one page). This is probably the author's attitude. It contains eleven essays: Confessions (1), Confessions (2), Who to Blame? Are You Hiding from Me? Farewell to the Passing Years, the Boredom of Modern People, My Elder Brother, One Night in Wushan, In Lushan. The common point of each article is the confession-style telling of inner depression and the shackles of the environment encountered.</p>
<p>The biggest symbol of the modern young people's greatest depression is naturally the question of love. In fact, love gives young people not victory but sorrow, not a paean but a curse. However, when the buds of youth are bright and beautiful, who can be exempt? If the feelings of human beings can be extinguished for a while, that's all. However, this is definitely impossible. Therefore, most of the cries of young people today that are reflected in literary and artistic works are curses on the manipulation of this love journey. Here, Confessions is also unable to escape the exception. I pick up my pen, dipping it in ink mixed with tears and with heavy sorrow, to write to you, regardless of whether you accept my intention or not and whether you want to listen to my incoherent words. I finally did this. If I have committed a crime, then you are my God. I hope you will forgive me as you forgive other people, and I hope you will be merciful and allow me to lie beside you, close my eyes, and have a sweet dream for a moment, so that my wandering soul can rest temporarily (one page). Because, but after all, I can't forget you. I can't forget you when I'm alive, and I can't forget you when I'm dead. I'm not afraid that one day my bones will turn into dust, but every tiny molecule in that dust still contains your existence, just like a soldier who has fallen on the battlefield, although his bones are already cold and his heart can no longer move, the wisp-like soul still cannot forget the country he came from (nine pages). Although he himself understands that he has taken the wrong path (two pages), emotion is, after all, a subtle thing. It seems ordinary, but it is also mysterious. It seems mysterious, but it is also ordinary. Moreover, the psychological state of young people is mostly like this. You are a lamp in the dark night, on the long road, in front of me. As long as I have you, I am not afraid of wind, rain, jackals, and tigers howling, or the violent forest waves caused by big trees. I am not afraid. Life is two eyes, and ideals are a lamp. With a lamp, the eyes can see. With an ideal, one can be a person. At this time, I can still muster the courage to move forward, just because I have this lamp to illuminate me in the dark night and on the dark long road (13 pages). These various fantasies that are cherished, where can we talk about courage and enthusiasm? It is just like this kind of meaningless moan, please accept this shadow of mine and do not forget that I, such a flower, once bloomed in the garden of your life, and at the same time, I can only be like Jingwei, carrying stones and branches to throw into the vast East China Sea year after year (14 pages). Oh, is this the so-called value of pursuit? Value?</p>
<p>Who to blame is also the same. Who cannot be blamed? He can only blame himself for putting new grape juice into old leather bags. Repent! It is useless. The withered buds and fallen leaves can never grow back on the branches. Was it wrong? Let it be wrong. I want to be wrong. I want to be wrong. In the end, it is a fork in the road. I have to go. I want to go to its end (15 pages). All illusory demands are nothing more than not forgetting that in this vast world there is such a me. He loves you, but he does not necessarily want you to love him. You hate him, but he does not necessarily hate you (17 pages). Although I think that I should not let down the blue sky above my head and the earth under my feet, to be a person must be a person and must be serious, and admit that if I do not climb to the top of the peak, I should not have started walking in the first place. Why retreat halfway? (21 pages) But in the end, there is no definite will.</p>

<p>Are you evading too? Seeming to be poured from the same mold, sweet memories of the past only bring futile sorrow. When life's boat hits fate's reef, living is certainly good, but dying is also proper. If the past karma is worth cherishing, then please remember me, remember you, a dream once experienced. If our encounter was unfortunate, then please forget me, as if forgetting someone insignificant. (Page 31) That's all.</p>
<p>Rejection is expressing that one's dreamlike past, foggy future, coupled with a gray present, is my life. (Page 37) So please forgive me, girl. I dare not exchange your true feelings with a false heart, nor accept your warm kisses with cold lips. I do not wish to squander the remaining days of my youth in your arms, therefore I must disappoint your sea-like depth and purity. (Page 33) What unsteady thoughts those are!</p>
<p>Only the fleeting water is truly saddened. The past life is a dim painting. (Page 52) Indeed, if life's journey were all smooth and level, without any steepness or ruggedness, and if there were no dramatic changes in life or strong blows to the soul during the decades of living, then even if one could spend the twilight years quietly, the meaning of being human and the value of life would inevitably be lost and completely extinguished. (Page 43) Unfortunately, although our author knows that the road ahead is at its end, why should I bother seeking a path out of the depths of despair? (Page 47) Regarding his own way out, he is still more hesitant and desolate than a wild goose carrying an arrow in the west wind. (Page 53) Alas, the depression of a neurotic youth probably symbolizes the majority.</p>
<p>"Four Years," is my favorite among them. Indeed, turning back to ask oneself, what has these four years of university life actually given me? (Page 57) I believe this is something no one can answer. Originally, when university life is about to end, two opposing feelings must coexist in everyone's heart: aversion and nostalgia. However, it is ultimately futile. Eventually, people put on square hats and black robes, accepting the vain degree with dignity, walking out of the school gate and stepping onto another path of life, shouldering the responsibility of being human. (Page 62) As for what happens after entering society, that is truly uncertain.</p>
<p>The boredom of modern people is truly a psychological sketch of the sick of the century, lacking courage towards life, society, and the nation. (Page 68) Alas, what kind of acupuncture treatment should be applied to restore them to their original vitality? It really cannot be obtained. Why do young people only know how to curse fate?</p>
<p>My elder brother's expressive power is excellent, with sincere feelings and heartfelt grief. But the sobbing of women and the crying of children cannot awaken your spirit in the tomb. You are gone, and from now on, all the changes in the human world, the temptations of sound and color, can no longer enter your heart. You are gone, no longer caring about the blooming and withering of flowers, the waxing and waning of the moon, the green and yellow of grass, the growth and fall of leaves. You are gone. (Page 82) In these few plain sentences, how much mourning is filled! Especially at this sorrowful time of brotherly death, how can one avoid reminiscence and inner lamentation?</p>
<p>"One Night in Wushan" and "In Lushan" are travelogues that cannot escape the style of a frustrated scholar, lamenting when facing beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>The writing in this collection is very beautiful and vivid, with few carved sentences. It is a pity that it is too much of an unconscious venting for the individual. The reason for this is the lack of ability to develop and express one's own life's demands, thus falling into unintentional sentimentality. This may be due to the author's life experience, but this point should be overcome with effort. You should know that our nation has suffered misunderstanding to this point, and this aspect of weakness and decline, the so-called sentimental and neurotic tendencies, has also affected many people.</p>

<p>The China Vocational Education Society was jointly founded by educators from the North and South in May of the sixth year of the Republic of China. Its purposes are (1) to promote and improve vocational education; (2) to improve general education to prepare people for life; and (3) to guide occupational improvement so that the unemployed have employment and the employed enjoy their work. Since its establishment, in addition to investigation, research, lectures, and guidance, it has established the China Vocational School, initially offering courses in ironwork, woodwork, button making, and sericulture, as well as a vocational education instructor training course and a preparatory course for studying in France through diligence and frugality. Currently, it offers courses in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, commerce, and the Shanghai Central Woodworking Classroom, with a total of over 700 students. Over 1,000 students have graduated in past years. It is affiliated with the China Ironworks Factory and the China Sericulture Factory. It jointly operates the Zhenjiang Women's Vocational School with local people in Zhenjiang, offering courses in sericulture with over 100 students. It also established the Sanyi Mulberry and Silk Farm in Qiaotou Town near Zhenjiang. In the vocational specialized night school affiliated with the Society, there are general bookkeeping courses, bank bookkeeping courses, survey statistics science courses, and Chinese typing courses. It also runs a worker's supplementary morning school and a common school. In recent years, to promote rural education, it has designated a rural area of over 2,000 people and 20 square miles in Xugongqiao, Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, to comprehensively improve the countryside, including village administration, agriculture, education, security, construction, and entertainment. It is entrusted by the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture and Forestry Committee to handle the rural improvement in Huangjia Town, Zhenjiang, with a population of over 5,000 and an area of 53 square miles. The methods are similar to those in Xugongqiao, but with special emphasis on production. The New Agricultural Implement Promotion Office, affiliated with the Society, manufactures and promotes new agricultural implements, guiding farmers to try them out, which has proven effective. The Society also has a service team to enhance the services of mechanical engineering students. The Society also has a vocational guidance office that provides guidance to young men and women on further education and employment, as well as job placement services. Dozens of people receive guidance every day. The Society publishes the "Education and Vocation" monthly magazine, the "Life Weekly," and 460 other special publications. The Society has had over 8,000 members. Recently, due to a lack of teachers, the board of directors and enthusiastic comrades have raised funds to support the Society, so that it can maintain its public mission. What is recorded here is a small part of the Society's activities.</p>
