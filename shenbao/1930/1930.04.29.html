<p>評時</p>
<h3>日議會中之爭論點</h3>
<p>世界經濟潮流之變。動工商貿易之盛衰。實皆隨時代以轉移。故所以應付之者。亦不能執一以强同。無論運用何種政策。非特須視國情。亦須觀察時代之狀態。歐美之政策。固未必能行於日本。即在歐美。前一時代可以運用某種政策。而在下一時代。即不能用。執政者昧此樞機。即鑿枘而不相入矣。</p>
<p>今日日議會中所爭論之財政政策。反對政府者。痛擊政府對於失業問題無辦法。與産業合理化之徒利於資本家而無益於勞動。濱口首相之答辯。則謂産業合理化。之目的。在招來産業之振興。不獨有利於資本家。即勞動亦受其益。濱口之言。固非無所見而云然也。産業合理化之政策。首行於美。而産業大增。成效大著。德國仿之。初亦成效大著。而其後漸爲勞動方面所攻擊者。即吾所謂時代之關係也。日本今日之時代是否適用産業合理化之政策。自有事實證明之。吾姑弗論。惟念今日當世界財政同一困難之際。各國當局。咸有應付乏術之苦。而所標榜之整理政策。又類多爲反對者所攻擊。非盡由政策本身之不善。亦以運用政策者。未知時代之性質。而少所變通也。今之行政當局。無論運用何種政策。皆須先明此義。其可膠固成見。而率爾操觚乎。産業政策。特一端而己。</p>

<p>職員選手······均己决定</p>
<p>五月上旬······啓程赴日</p>
<p>籃球排球實力最强將與我國决戰田徑長跑不及日本足球可得亞軍本屆錦標能否獲得全持游泳棒球游泳有日本强敵中國棒球亦可畏（馬尼拉通訊）菲列濱自上屆大會在滬失販後、全島人氣非常激昻、誓於本屆會中雪恥、以冀獲得遠東覇權、奪取天皇杯藉揚赤道國健兒之奮勇、本年大會菲島籌備最早、一月即開始地方預選、二月在馬來拉市開嘉年華會、全國優秀選手畢集　結果成績驚人、新紀錄頻出、菲島參加大會之選手及其他人員、共百六十餘名、將由農務次官佐治氏統率渡日、五月上旬將抵横　濱現在菲島各校均己休假、因當地氣候關係每年自三月至六月爲暑期、際此大好機會、各項運動俱皆熱烈、菲島之全體選手、均合宿於馬來拉市之訓練所内、每日有専員指揮練、習菲島之各種競技委員如次、</p>

<p>（排球委員）巴卜陸氏、加爾門女士、</p>
<p>（足球委員）締益敺彌新氏、</p>
<h3>（二）各種比賽實力</h3>
<p>據菲體育恊會（Ｐ·Ａ·Ａ·Ｆ）會長伊蘭南博士話談、本屆所增加之會外拳鬥、菲島選手、恐無人敵、正式競技、、日本之田徑網球最有希望、中華足球有把握、菲島籃排球實力最强、故此次菲方能否獲得覇權、全在游泳棒球二種、但不幸菲方游泳選手、發生爭執棒球則漸取退化、上屆大會、菲軍棒球全滅客歳、大阪每日新聞之棒球隊遠征曾擊敗全菲島、博士又云、今次大會、即日本亦難樂觀、將不免與新興之中國有一塲苦戰、據可靠消息、菲島代有選手各項競技之實力如次</p>
<h3>（三）田徑短跑有警人表演</h3>
<p>菲利濱素以短中距離著、優秀選手最多、因長距離不及日本、故近多失田徑錦標、其短跑輒有驚人之表演、如伸乍加氏之百米、在順風時、其成績爲一○秒四、平等世界紀錄、其他如高欄·低欄·高跳之選手、亦皆令人稱嘆、其田徑之各種成績如下、</p>
<p>（百米）伸乍加氏、、（一○秒五）攝波姆氏（一○秒七）、彌加諾耳氏（一○秒八）阪達比拉氏（二秒）</p>

<p>（擲鐵餅）魯顔治氏顔司加蘭締氏、沙瑪諾氏、（各自一一○呎、至一二○呎）</p>
<h3>（四）游泳選手不可靠</h3>
<p>自六屆大阪大會以來、迄至八屆上海大會　菲列濱獲游泳錦標　如同探囊取物、不廢吹灰之力、因之菲島對於游泳競技、頗覽自傲、但本屆大會與菲列濱不利之處　即會期係在五月日菲之氣候、大相異别、菲選手多畏寒、此恐不能勝日本一也、今歲菲島之優秀選手九名、因預選時裁判不公、宣告脫離代表團、不能參加大會、而日本之優秀選手、在遠東大會未開幕前、决不赴他國比賽、菲方此恐不能勝日本二也、現據一般之推測、本屆游泳錦標日本有六成希望、菲島只有四成、菲選手之各項紀錄如下、</p>
<p>（五十米）烏爾加氏、阿里氏、（各五七秒五分之一）、山翁古司治氏（五八秒）海加里亞氏、（五八秒五）</p>

<p>以上各紀錄、均係二十五米長游泳池内之競技、</p>
<h3>（五）棒球隊圖雪前恥</h3>
<p>本屆菲列濱之棒球隊、曾經精密之選拔、苦心之訓練、意在圖雪上海之恥、此次之代表選手、多係選自稅關局、各選手之姓名如次、</p>

<p>秦淮古稱佳麗地。六朝金粉。南部烟花長板橋邊烏衣巷口妥孃詞曲。頓老琵琶。旖旎風光。傅爲韻事。顧自洪武以來。（莆田余談心板橋雜記。載洪武初年。建十六樓以處官妓。澹烟輕粉。重譯來賓。稱一時韻事云云。）五六百年。變亂頻仍。滄桑屢易。美人黄土。名士靑衫。一片歡場。久己鞠爲茂草。遣聞軼事往迹依稀。雖江左流風。於今未替。而湖海賓游。徴歌選色。陽阿舞後。不似當年繁艶矣。爾以厲行禁娼。益復花事闌珊。舊院河亭。攺作一閧之塵市。秦淮畫舫。夷爲措大之浮家。（舊時停泊夫子廟前及秦淮河中之茶舫。畫舫有復興悅來得勝濤園等。均雕欄繪檻。上施角鐙。裙屐笙歌。聲光繚亂。予於四五年前。猶及見之。今則鳳去樓空。盡作平民之住所矣。）明月不常。彩雲易散六朝如夢。空復低徊。昔時烟花女閭。其有稍諳音律者。於是羣趨茶社。以校書標榜鬻歌。藉避官中耳目。而夫子廟一帶之茶社。亦以藝伎鬻歌。禁令在所不及。且利其聲色繁華。堪資號召。無不競相羅致。以兼營清唱。樊樓鐙火。絲管紛陳。十餘輩歌姬。妝束登塲。互賡迭唱。珠喉扇影。紙醉金迷。自日午至丙夜座客常盈笙簫不輟其生涯之盛。均能歷久而弗衰。良以禁娼而後。招招者多己銷聲歛跡。莫敢公然獻笑。春秋佳日。徴逐之徒。棖觸前塵。不無拊髀而興感。蓋此有數之茶社。己成爲唯一之歡塲矣。惟是綺羅結隊。粉黛成雲。妍媸不一。才技有差。其屬色藝兼優。人文雙擅者亦復不易多覯。若麟鳳閣之李蘭芳。天韻樓之張新紅陸艶秋。與前隷奇芳閣現己離京之蕭瑜等。均以舉止嫻雅。哥喉圓潤。於儕輩中堪推翹楚。自鄧鄶以下。初不過尋常凡艶耳。近某小報同文。以欣賞藝術提倡歌舞爲辭。有首都歌舞明星選舉會之發起。閒情逸致。結習未忘。想至日蕊榜臚傅春風綰領。定有一番佳話。爲靑谿白下生色也。</p>
<h3>巨魚考繡君</h3>
<p>湖口巨魚一則。見三月二十七日本報略謂阜寜東面臨海。射陽湖口之老湖地方。發現己死大魚一尾。形狀如馬。身高丈餘。重約三百餘石。兩目俱無。附近居民漁船見之。罔不駭異。爭臠割之。充饑數日。餘則分往市鎭求售。所獲甚鉅云云。昔人謂水族中惟魚爲最大。初不之信。今湖口魚若是之巨。始恍然於昔人之所言不誣矣。當米價翔貴聲中。而有此巨魚充數日飢。未始非饋貧糧也。余因遐稽古籍。類此之巨魚。不在少數。彚而存之。攸助談資。錄如下。</p>
<p>漢書五行志云。建平三年。東萊平度。出大魚。長八尺。高丈一尺。七枚皆死。後漢書五行志云。熹平二年。東萊海出大魚二枚。長八九丈。高二丈餘。北史。　嶺上有順天神祠。前有一魚骨。中有孔。可通馬騎出入。劇談錄。李德裕有巨魚脇骨一條。長二丈五尺。其上刻云。會昌二年。海中送到。案徽通志。開成二年。有大魚長六丈。自海入淮至濠州。宋史五行志。至道元年十二月。廣州大魚。擊海水而出。魚死。長六丈三尺。高丈餘。秘閣閒談。李崇矩見海上沙島有大魚。剖基腹。得一艇船。兼三死人。衣服猶備。宋史五行志。嘉定十七年海壤畿縣鹽官地數十里先是有巨魚横海。岸民臠食之。海患共六年而平。寓簡。沈作哲嘗過海上至補陀山。見海中數十里外。有旌旗如軍行數萬騎者。洶湧東下。問其人。曰。此大魚耳。旌旗者。蓋鱗　也。農田餘話。張氏有國時。邑中（謂上海墮一海魚。長幾二丈。名曰闊霸。福建通志。弘治末年。漳浦九都有巨魚入。潮落不能去。鄕人爭剖其肉。時飢頼以濟。江南通志。嘉靖二十六年。蘇州花浦口。捕獲大魚。馬首有足。重二千斤。廣西通志。嘉靖三十五年。七月二十三日。太平府有巨魚長丈餘。出没水面。凡三日乃止。其鯉魚之髫。皆聯於尾。見者怪之。江南通志。崇禎十二年春。松江有二大魚。長數十丈。目中可容三人。無睛。冷廬雜識。台州城中東獄廟有魚骨橙。闊一尺長丈餘。中平。兩端曲。形似橙。廟祝云。是魚之尾骨。其脊骨更大。在海濱某廟中。</p>
<p>綜上所述。是湖口發現之死魚。猶未足爲巨也。特形狀如馬。與嘉靖時蘇州花浦口之大魚同。身高丈餘。與東萊平度之大魚同。兩目俱無。與崇禎時松江之二大魚</p>
<h3>常識屑嵐光</h3>
<p>在風中燃擦火柴。每苦吹。滅當於己燃時。即放入火柴匣中。决無吹滅之虞。</p>
<p>步行如大西路等冷僻馬路。最宜小心。以防汽車風馳電製而來。不及退避。試看汽車肇禍。往往冷僻處多於熱閙處。即其明證。</p>
<p>行路之穏妥。黄包車不及汽車。汽車不及電車。價康物美四字。。電車當之、洵無愧色。</p>
<p>路遇乞丐追隨時。可叉入對馬路。乞丐必頽然而退。蓋各有地盤故也。</p>
<p>剖竹筆桿爲二部。削其下端成鏟形。復嵌軟筆其中。可成用器畫中直筆二支。以供繪畫。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（三）靈花</h3>
<p>初四得一佳夢。夢見月中出光。照余心。作詩一首夢。中見明月。流光照我心。月中放異彩。眞仙乃觀音。祥光射我頂。入我心脾深。乃晤母子謎。證明直至今。一十百千萬。大地變黄金初五游新世界。略與上海同。而規模甚小。亦有電影中國京戲。游人甚多。價一二角。有跑木馬亭。甚有趣。圓機關一。動則座中人各在此跨之木馬上。上下活動。不定爲馬形。或在魚中。蝦中。均隨機關而上下。余曰。此亦六道輪廻天人離居者也。而因果一定。身隨輪轉。不自由矣。上海日本此戲均有之。</p>
<p>初六在養正中學演講。題爲（大中華文化之眞價及其民族在二十世紀之任務。）大致根據東西文化史。證明西方民族文化。無支配世界之能力。惟東方民族有之。而二十世紀統一世界大同之任務。尤専在華人云。此篇關係極大。特錄於下。</p>
<p>英儒Ｄarwin說人差不多從猴猿種進化來的。這話遠一些至少在十萬年以前。我們不及說了。單說一萬年前歐人才知用石頭。以後才會用骨頭。例加骨笛是到了有史可傅說。非洲的埃及可數到西歷前五千四百年。有金字塔可考　而我伏義朝己在西歷前二九五三年。又西歷前一千年。西方雖無史。而己知從東方學用鐵。所謂東方指小亞西亞一帶也。紀元後十二三世紀。西人始知煤。說是燒石頭。希拉有史可傅說。蓋在前七世紀。其前六世紀爲釋迦佛。及老子生之時代。希拉之全盛。則前四世紀時。梭命Ｓolon6362丨５５８希拉立法家之聖賢也。游學於非洲埃及之僧侣。僧訓之曰。汝希拉人後生輩。尚無可發言之地也。就是西文字母Ａbphabeto也是從埃及斐尼基商人傅於希拉。至前四六六年時。希拉聖君斐力克來爲希拉黄金時代。治績可當中國之周公。然彼則受東方學術文化甚多。一切學者。多自小亞西亞之西南角一個地方名Ｉonia往希拉。本來伊奥尼亞派哲學。是在小亞西亞一個地方。名呌Ｍlletw密理土。故又名密理土學派。著名哲人有Ｔhaleso前６４０丨５００是後希拉９１０丨５４２Ａnarimenes約前５５０年Ａnagoras前５５０丨２４６等諸哲他師徒數人一個主說明宇宙元素由水合成。一個說宇宙是從無極而來。又一個說由一氣化生。他們是去希拉傅道。爲希拉第一期哲學創造者。最後一個。就與希拉周公斐氏爲朋友的。不但諸男哲學家去到希拉做開山祖師。連女哲學家也是由東方去的。舉一例希拉周公最高樞密女顧問。是女聖雅雪史斐雅。Ａspasia他不但是斐王的心腹。他們的關係。較斐王之妻還深。他也是小亞西亞人這位雅姑娘。不但是斐王的顧問。又是希拉三聖蘇克拉底拍拉圖的師友。他曾勸斐王攺専制爲共和國。可算古今唯一女聖了。也是亞洲人去敎化歐洲人呢。這是第一期希拉時代東西文化的老張本。</p>

<h3>郵員趣史履冰</h3>
<p>英國有某郵員。天性善睡。每夜須於四時到班工作。而彼則常致悮時。屢誡不悛。因此上級人員。加以警告。如積習難返。即須斥革郵員家中。特備有鬧鐘兩具。按時使鳴。特此巨大之聲響。尚不足驅逐睡魔。有時郵員臥時。竟不脫其靴。俾倉卒中得省穿着之煩。不意經過一載後。此郵員忽能照規定鐘點。值班應卯。幾可作全體之模範。據其自述云。一入夜間。即將鬧鐘開定。鐘之他端。司一彈簧之啓閉。叮噹鳴時。因鐘錘之動。使置近頭部之水匣。自由開放。冷水澆及頸項。乃不期然而醒悟此法居然奏效。該員之喜可知矣。</p>
<p>其後郵員結婚。床頭有人。未必與其同有善睡之癖。因諄囑夫人。按時唤醒。不過尚以爲未盡可恃。因仍沿襲老法。使用水匣。詎意及時而鳴。冷水直流。臥在身畔之夫人。大受影響。結果遂羞於赴局工作。蓋其面部己現其夫人之爪痕矣。</p>
<p>上述事實。足供趣談。乃記於傑克遜氏之新著。厥名爲（郵員航空史。）以其富於詼諧。因譯述以告自由談讀者。</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市一蹶不振</h3>
<p>大盤依然呆軟</p>
<p>閘北　昨日各檔來泊源略有抵埠、河中存積仍厚、申地走銷日呆、緣各店胃己滿觀望、兼之洋米軋脚、故白粳交易異常清淡、價因高貨缺乏、次貨充斥、故上落靡定、昨午中關粳買客寥寥、大盤又軟角許、頂粳尚覺俏俐、薄稻高挺次疲、貨雖不多、市則奇、呆羊杜秈到微交淡、邇來秈市若有若無、價則頗堅、通變陰元去路祇酒坊略進、、行情初跌後定、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到船十號之譜、常錫北粳本街尚活、行情定立、蘇同機粳銷化麻木市頗欠佳、高貨無上落中次微軟、約計半角之出人、南帮薄早稻有少數客帮問津、而喝價極緊、頂貨隨到隨空、次貨不免受削、羊杜尖　刻下南路貨極少、交易沉静、白元去化甚滯、本街雖有一部份問津、但因過於批别、貨主不允、市成互擯價格明平暗弱、</p>
<h3>交割在即近粉再疲</h3>
<p>天時關係遠月背馳</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午各月份呈近疲遠穏之象、十二月份因交在邇、實銷依然未動、大廠家雖無空頭、惟空出廠家之籌碼、則仍不少、當此銷路不起之時、少數實際之壓迫、多頭殊難勝任、故浮多隨時了結、空方則亦趁勢抵補、然趨勢則不免疲滯一點也、遠期各月份初亦平疲、迨至下午、因天時又見微雨、浮空及做心思者、一時買氣又暢、故各盤略見回振、惟中小廠家、對於五六月份、仍有出檔、良以本月份之結局如是、一出本月份、亦不免與本月份相仿、故未來之近疲遠定、彷彿目下己見呈兆也、結果本月份較前週收價又小二厘半、五月份較好二厘半、六七月份好七厘半、八九月份好五厘云、</p>
<h3>現麥需淡步落五分</h3>
<p>細雨推助期市略振</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份呈初平繼堅之勢、上午以密雲不雨洋麥報價、亦漲落互見一二角、故人心尚定、迨至下午開、盤則以又降微雨、外行心思重振、内地如錫帮等際此晴雨不常之時、心思非常堅挺、故後此市况、大落彷彿尚有待也、結果六月份較前週回漲三分、七九八月份三各漲二分、現麥統市做開五千餘包、惟喊價較前週末己小去五分、因廠家方面、均以粉銷不佳、麥之需要均呆、市面步喊步落、大有供多於求之勢也、開徐州·清江浦·宿州·蚌埠等麥五兩、由阜豐辦去云、</p>

<h3>最近屯婺茶訊</h3>
<p>屯溪茶號對開塲問題都半觀望</p>
<p>婺源方面以杨本高貴均抱悲觀</p>
<p>屯溪爲休歙夥績茶市集中地、本鎭及率口·黎陽·陽湖等處不下七十餘家、今歳舊有茶號、除一部分己預備開塲、大半多在觀望、其故因外銷能否暢達、尚無把握現俄銷雖告復活、而所沽盤價極低、僅數運稅裝璜等費　華商所受虧折、每擔不下四十兩、兼之茶棧放匯縮緊、内地銀根不暢、山價不能抑低、茶號鑒此種種困難、無復往年之告奮、日來屯市現洋頗充、票價比月初回跌至一千三百八十元　觀察屯地茶號能否增加、須視滬市開船升落爲轉移云、</p>
<p>婺源綠茶質屬高莊成本山價均較他處爲昻、本年因米價飛漲、物價倍高、每擔茶葉採焙完成、須工三十隻、計工資二十七元、伙食七元、　　柴火十元、雜項五元、平日培壅工本十元、總計約在六十元、較舊每擔須增費十五元、初各號猶希冀山價降低　照此山户成本、將來開秤、每擔須八十元内外、故茶號睹茲山價、製就成箱、成本更重、前途多抱悲觀云、</p>
<h3>英茶商限制産額</h3>
<p>印度爪哇茶自一九二五年來、其産額己由二千萬擔、激增至四千萬擔、雖英倫市塲銷胃廣大、然己大感供過於求、存底旣充、茶價大跌、茶商頗有岌岌可危之勢、現經英倫茶商一致議、决自本年度起、從嚴限制産量、以維茶業云、</p>

<p>主席報告　主席陳德徴致開會辭云、中央代表·各位來賓·各位同志、今天是中國國民黨上海特别市執行委員會執行委員監察委員監察委員、在此地宣誓就職、這次執行委員監察委員、是從中國國民黨上海特别市第六次全市代表大會産生的　在第六次全市代表大會席上關於黨務、關於政治、關於其他工作、都有了一個嚴密完整的指示、從嚴密完整的决議案上、使就職的執監委員、都有了一條明顯的努力的路徑、當今天宣誓的時候、本席想把一年來我們的工作、向中央代表各位來賓各位同志作一個綜合的簡略的執告過去一年的環境、給我們的影響太大了、市黨部工作、多在應付一方面、實際的工作方面、乃有想要顧到而事實不允許的情形、經過了第六次全市代表大會之後、我們預先有了嚴整的步驟和計劃、使一切事體　都將在己定的計劃之、下完整的實現、在黨黨務方面、不外四大標的、就是組織方面·宣傳方面·訓練方面·民衆訓練方面　這四方面在第六次全市代表大會上都有了嚴整的指示、在組織方面、我們依照第六次全市代表大會的决議、一步一步的做去、在一年内、可以使上海全市黨的組織嚴密成功、不祇是區分部區黨部嚴密起來、還要使個個同志、都能做本黨的先鋒、同志們在像網一樣的嚴密的組織之下、運用靈活、做到像身之使臂·臂之使指、在宣傳方面、過去受環境的影響太大了、臨時事件、竟有應接不暇的形勢、以致黨的工作、不能盡如最初的計劃、向民間去、深入於民衆中間　現在我們不但要擴大宣傳、並且要深人民間、使大家信仰主義、服從黨的意志、這固然是我們所應努力的、但也是希望於各位常常指示的一點、訓練方面、過往在草創時期、從前很少做過訓練工作、這一年來才將訓練工作標明出來、現在我們要使個個黨員、接受黨的命令、服從黨的意志、在敎育方面、要敎育界切實的合乎黨義去實施、我們有計劃、要使黨員訓練與黨義敎育、在一年内、都有相當的成績、至於民衆訓練、我們知道、在上海這一件工作、是最難做的、因爲上海人口繁多華洋雜處　份子複雜、但是難固然不能避免、在黨的一方面、難也就是我們最好的機會、我們要用黨的意志、克服困難、在過去有許多、古裏古怪的事件、今後則不但要使民衆的組織嚴密、並且要使民衆服從黨的命令接受、黨的意志去執行、我們原意依照這路徑去努力尤望大家能共同的恊助我們、在今天黨的方面、還有很多的話要說、不過爲了時間的關係、只能舉其重要的、在此講一講關於政治的、也不妨再講一點、在以黨救國以黨治國以黨建國的時代上黨對於政治的責任、比任何時任何國的情形都重大、黨對於政、治負有監督考察之責、在過去上海的政治當局能把一切的工作都表示於民衆之前、即使民衆滿意的原因、乃是當局的努力、也是黨政聯合在一起的成功、在政府方面、認爲政治工作就是黨的工作、在黨部一方面、認爲黨的工作、就是扶助政府的工作因此有許多事件　是别地没有做到的、上海已經做到了、我敢相信長此下去、政府自認政治工作就是黨的工作、黨部自認黨的工作就是扶助政府的工作、那末六年訓政、一定比任何地方要完成得早、這就是以黨政聯合的力量、克服一切複雜的勢力的成功、所以今後也只要依照第六次全市代表大會的决議去努力將來的成功、一定比過去的還要偉大、此外還有許多事、是六次代表大會交給我們的我們部希望大家帮助我們、使之完全實現、我們希望於中央代表各位來賓各位同志的　第一是希望各位同志時之臨督着我們、使今天在此就　者時時刻刻勿忘第六次全市代表大會的决議、所祈求於各位同志的、就是這幾位就職的執監委員力量有限、必使全體同志全市民衆合力相助　使决議案件、在執行時毫不發生困難、這是第一點、第二點上海人口繁多、情形複雜、　如說上海有許多反動勢力的巢窟、有許多我們工作進行上的障碍希望大家在消極方面去掉一件困難、即就是作積極方面帮助市黨部完成了一件工作、這是第二點第三點大家的氣力、部用在應付反動派的上面、故在這時、期尤望大家注意反動份子的活躍、大家起來檢舉反動份子、使黨的工作進行上、一帆風順、使大家的氣力、多集中在建設的工作上面、這是第三點、還有一點、同志間過去往有不能互相諒解的情形、這穏的互相猜忌、就是無形的減少革命的力量、我們相信、惟有用革命的力量、可以使全市文化和政治發展、惟有用革命的力量、可以使民衆得到安居樂業、所以望大家再不要互相發生無謂的攻訐和詆毁、要共同恊助本屆執監委員、執行第六次全市代表大會的决議、總之、執監委員不過二十餘人、力量有限但要使他們的力量大起來、也很容易這就要各位同志的恊助、各位能悉心恊助執監委員的力量就大、否則、便不能發見多少的力量的、以上幾句很浮淺的話、就是本席代表全體執監委員、諸位很誠懇地講述的、也就是希望於諸位的幾點意思　完了、</p>
<p>代表訓詞　中央代表蔡孑民先生敎訓詞、略謂今天是諸位委員的宣誓就職典禮、元培奉中央命令來監誓、上海黨部的地位、除了首都、没有再比此地重要的了、上涨是個很複雜的地方、當革命軍未到長江流域之、前上海本來就有很多的同志在擔任着很重要的工作、革命軍到了以後、依然没有鬆懈、諸位委員過去就是很努力的、剛才主席陳委員執告第六次全市代表大會的决議中央己經知道、這樣的準備一年的工作、中央認爲很滿意在上海情形之下、最重要乃是民衆訓練工作、我們要把民衆個個訓練都有黨員的資格、這一點自從中央發見了從前在廣東在武漢時的錯誤、便積極的從實際上去努力、如造林識字等等的運動的規定、要從省市黨部到縣黨部區黨部區分部分頭進行、還有在訓政時期、要訓練民衆四　的運、用將來就可以達到憲政時期了、但是如造林識字、必使民衆知道、如無森林將來會有災荒、以及森林與水利的關係等等、必定都要使他們澈底明瞭才行、他們所以不明瞭的、是不知道我們的宣傳、又如訓練民衆運用四權單靠白話、效力也很有限、而且許多法律的條文、也不能用白話翻譯、總理黨初也見到這層、所以要敎國人都能識字、識字運動、就是訓政時期開始的最要緊的工作、最近敎育會議通過、又經中央决定的注音符號、乃是識字最好的工具、因爲僅僅用現在的文字推行、非常困難、即就千字課而論、讀完千字課、而能看書報的、依然很少、注音符號、乃吳稚　先生研究發明的辦法、先敎他用土音注音、便很容易識字、在民衆能識注音符號之後、訓政時期的工作、進行起來、就容易了、先由區分部推行到附近的人家、漸漸推行到全市民衆、是很方、便今天對於上海諸位委員、没有什麽可以指導、特地提出新從中央决定注音符號於大家之前、希望大家在執行全市第六次代表大會决議案之外、對於這個識字的工具、、加以一番注意</p>
<p>來賓演詞　（市長張岳軍演說）略謂、各位來賓、兄弟是本黨的黨員、今天本市各位委員在這裏就職、應該來表示些意思、同時以本市行政長官的資格、來說幾句話、上海特别市執委會的工作、一向是非常努力的、這是大家所公認、不僅是同志們所公認也是一般民衆們所公認、自秘密時期至公開以後、其工作成績的優良、爲各地黨部冠、全國各地的黨部中、實可以上海黨部爲模範、清黨以後至去年攺選、在很惡劣的環境中、各委員各同志、都能以總理之言爲軌範、以總理之行爲表率、無間先死、百折不撓、此種精神、此種忠實努力的精神、兄弟個人、是感覺非常的欽佩、在座諸同志、也必定是和我同樣的感覺欽佩的、剛才主席報告、對於本市第六次全市代表大會、關於黨務上今後努力的方針、對於黨的組織、如何去嚴密起來、黨的基礎、如何鞏固起來黨的宣傅如何擴大、黨員的訓練·與民衆的訓練·如何加緊等議、案要完全去實現、這是全市的同志們和民衆所非常希望的、中國國民黨、是以黨治國·以黨建國·以黨救國的、在第一次全國代表大會裏、早己確定了、假如不能這樣做到、那中國簡直不知要弄到怎樣地步、要實行以黨治國·以黨建國·以黨救國、黨要站在監督指導的地位、絶對不客氣地、加於監督和指導政府、政府也要絶對受黨的督促和指導互相磋商、互相帮助、以達到眞正以黨治國的意義、以完成訓政時期的工作、兄弟自去年四月就職以來、在這一年多中間、因環境的關係、對於所應當做的工作、頗以不能完全實現爲憾、全市府的同志、也有如此的感覺、黨部方面、也能原諒、一年以來、督促不輟指導有加、黨與政之關係、日益密切、我們希望此種關係、此種精神、隨時間而進步、隨時間而密切、使上海特别市的政治、漸漸走到軌道上去、使反動份子澈底消滅、使民衆得到安居和樂業、諸位委員、論私都是好友、論公都是本黨最忠實的同志、彼此大家都有深切的認識的、我們今後所希望於各委員的、就是要希望各委員更進一步的努力、以完成其使命、（商整會葉惠鈞演說）略謂、今天上海特别市黨部的執監委員舉行宣誓就職典禮、我們的商人民衆、都是非常歡迎的我們爲、什麽要歡迎、因爲同中有一個大目的、大希望就是因爲上海的民衆無出路、日夜在亂跑、要希望上海特别市的執監委員、指導一條出路、以達到其正當的大道上的目的、使全市二百多萬民衆、不致走錯路、我可以說、上海全市的民衆的生命、都在就職的執監委員身上、如果全體執監委員、不能够替民衆找出正當的路來、全市的民衆、都要死去了我相信諸位就職之後一定能够負起這個責任的、所以歡迎云云、</p>
<p>委員答詞　執監委員代表潘公展致答辭云　今天上海特别市執監委員宣誓就職　承中央代表·及各位先生·各位同志·來指敎我們以後所應做的工作、我們非常感激、同時要把各位說的話歸納起來作爲執監委員會一年中工作的南針、先就中央代表蔡先生所特别提出的識字運動中的一個方法、就是用注音符號說一說、我們相信　只有識字一個方法、才能使民智開通、四權的訓練、也要從民智的開發始、同時我們相信用現有的字、來開發民智是不行的、例如貼一張標語、說（不識字不能做國民）、甚至於說（不識字不能做人）、但給什麽人看呢、給識字的人看吧、他們不必看它、給不識字的人看吧、他們根本看不　、所以用字來使人識字、是一個夢想、惟有用注音符號才够達到這個目的、現中央已决定用注音符號做宣傳和敎育的工具、蔡先生特别提出這點、我們是十二分鄭重的接受遵行、我們還有一個申明的、是從前許多黨務工作者、都將工作當爲黨部的工作、而不是黨的工作、如今天收幾件公文發幾件公文、混不管實際於民衆的效率、如識字運動、乃是黨的工作、是中央規定的七項運動之一、假如用黨部的力量去、就不成功了、上海二百八十萬民衆、其間不識字的不下數十萬、單靠黨部人員的力量、去敎他們識字、一定不能够、必定要先使全市黨員、全明白了注音符號、然後用全市黨員、去敎給他們接近的民衆再靠這一部分已識字的民衆、去領導其餘尙未識字的人來識字　才能成功、這不過是用識字做一個榜樣、一切的工作都應該如此做去、例如植樹運動、僅以代表在每年植幾棵樹、這樣就是十年百年、上海一定還是這幾棵樹的、故必須在大家規定時間分頭努力做去　然後始有成功的希望同時我們聽到張市長講的過去一年來、上海的反動勢力、甚形囂張、然而未有大亂子閙出來的、乃是黨政合作的原故、故以後黨政更要完全是一家人一樣的、對於民衆方面、葉先生所謂的二百八十萬民衆、關在竹園裏無出路、要執監委員領導他們出來、這責任太大了、我們的力量太小了、但是我們旣被選爲執監委員就應該努力負擔這個責任、不過上海在租界未收回以前、環境複雜、許多事項、不能如希望的容易、必須民衆中有非宣者出來、接受本市執監委員會意旨、領導其他民衆、從付園裏找出路、我們知道最難的事、是中庸的事、但也是最穏當的、撗衝直撞、是最容易、故只有走中央的路、不左不右、依照總理遺敎去走、不但司以領導上海全市民衆、全國民衆、都司領導的　現在己有明燈在前、我們更要沿途點起路燈、使民衆在中庸的大道上前進、是以我們不但黨政合作、遵照中央的意旨、執行第六次全市代表大會决議案、還要使我們的工作、我們的力量、深深入於民衆的中間、也就是這層意思、</p>
<p>委員誓文　余誓以至誠、遵奉總理遺囑、信仰本黨主義、服從本黨命令、遵守黨綱黨紀、完成國民革命、實現三民主義、以求中國之自由平等、决不徇私誤黨、腐化惡化、如有違背願受本黨最嚴厲的處分、謹誓、</p>

<h3>泰順船員被捕眞相</h3>
<p>碼頭工鬥毆之大慘劇</p>
<p>招商局之泰順輪、此次由滬赴温、州船到該埠時、發生船員被捕竊米大交涉、及碼頭工人打死人命等諸大事、今該輪業己返滬、茲將各事之原委、查明分記如下</p>
<p>旅客烟具波累船　員近來温州方面、因愼重地方防務、特組織軍警聯合稽查處、對於各處商輪到埠、必須檢查旅客、十分嚴密、此回泰順輪往温州、船未停埠、軍警稽查處即派兵士二十名、由排長一員率領、各乘小舢、板於船尾扳登上輪、分赴各艙檢查、至統艙室之看艙室内（讓售與旅客）、發見烟具全副、即由稽查隊兵士四人、將此禁品取去、喊船員交出携帶此烟具之人犯、在人聲喧嚷中、該搭客己經潛逃、船員搜尋無着、而兵士堅執不允、同至二買辦室、將二買辦王某拖出欲帶去、在等持間、船上之帳房王嵐清、與管事簡容二人到來、向各兵士陳述夾帶此禁特之客、己無從尋覓、而四兵士便出蔴繩、將王·簡·二人捆捕而去、當時王·簡·二人、單褲赤足、並穿衣都不及、被押拘於稽查處内、船員之連夜往保者、均遭拒絶、謂須將正犯交到、方可將二人放出、故昨日泰順由温還滬、而王簡尚未放出、現己由該輪業務主任、報局請爲交涉、</p>
<p>棧司偷米釀大衝突　温州因災荒、在滬辦大宗洋米、前往平糶者、泰順輪亦運此平米至温州者、船員對運米最重視、因缺少須賠、故出卸時十分當心、所載米糧中、有永利棧購進之貨一批、在起上之時、船員發見該棧棧司、有竊偷米糧之事、當被查出即報告碼頭警察、而將偷米之棧司交警察捕去、不意因此而激生極大之衝突、被逮之棧司、爲米棧方面人所奪回、與警察先發生鬥毆而米棧方面、且開公會、否認有偷米行、爲謂係船員謗毁其名譽、要求泰順輪須賠償損失、其所提條件爲（一）罰酒三十桌、（二）演戲兩台、（三）道歉、後經公會出任調解、勸順泰息事寗人、認罰酒筵兩席、並代放鞭砲等了事、一塲風潮得告平息、</p>
<p>工人爭貨打死四人　温州碼頭工人、分立門户、杠棒工内、有所謂海員帮、柴爿帮等名稱者、其在招商局碼頭工作者、係海員帮工人、今回泰順輪到温、各帮小工、爭欲起貨、而柴爿帮工人、與海員帮工人、因爭貨而致毆打、此事因不與輪船相關、亦非輪局所應問之事、故不加干涉、而兩帮工、人則在碼頭上大打、各用杠棒等亂擊、結果有柴爿帮工人四名、因被打受傷過重、而即行身死、現此事己由當地公安局將行兇之各工人等、均經捕、去今該慘案、己釀成重大之交涉、</p>
<p>温州輪來滬均延遲　自小工鬥毆慘斃案發生、碼頭工人、當時均罷工、停止裝卸貨物、招商局適有三輪在温州、除廣利先行開來滬外、泰順輪之來滬時間、亦因受臨時停工、使裝貨被其延滯、因而遲到上海、又有廣濟、輪應於昨日到上海者、今亦須緩到一天、定本日方可進、口</p>

<h3>英國桂冠詩人白列奇逝世</h3>
<p>白列奇（ＲobertBrjdges）是一九一三年當選的桂冠詩人、現年八十五歲、本月二十一日死於倫敦、他是一位古怪得難料理的詩人、因着他的堅毅、獨立、自信的精神、而得着當時桂冠詩人的榮譽、</p>
<p>他早年是一個醫生、從離開牛津大學以後、曾經去游歷、在後就在倫敎ＳtＢartbolomews學、習醫學成一位軍醫、而且在兒童醫院裏做過助醫、也曾經做過醫生、於一八八二年退職、决心從事於文學、</p>
<p>在當時英國許多著名的文學家之中、白列奇可以永遠佔領一個重要的地位、雖則他是一個醫生、是一個在醫院裏實習過多年、很能自信的熟練的醫生、但是一種内在的文學的天才、早己滋長着去制服了他自己、結果是在一八八二年决心棄掉了他醫藥的生涯、而完全委身於文學、當一九一二年被任爲桂冠詩人的頭銜的時候、他祇不過出版了很少的作品、因爲許多年來他保持着堅毅、獨立的精神、所以在人家正在興高采烈閙得五花八門的時候、他會一聲不嚮地保守着一個緘默静寂的時期、他曾經有許多年不寫一行詩、雖則當那時的世界正過着一個重要的時期、如像關於大戰時的各國所犧牲了的各種事業、獲勝後的紀念、以及可歌頌的世界和平、這許多很深刻的印象、他都毫不顧到、</p>
<p>當時有許多的反對者、在白列奇被選任桂冠詩人的時候、曾經反對說、那種榮譽給他是過份的、應該獻給同時候的英國詩人吉百林、因爲他的天才、無論在那個時候都不會窮盡的、但是白列奇仍舊保持着他的緘默、當他拒絶去寫頌揚休戰紀念的詩的時候、很惹起一般的反對、他似乎有着他自己的兵器、可以不爲那些反對者所動、他說他是一個詩人、詩是一種靈感的東西、不是一種要以役使的東西、讓别人去冩他們所要寫的、至於他呢、覺得這戰爭是一種可怕的慘劇、一點也引不起這建立在詩的基礎上的高尚的感情、因爲那個對他是没有一些靈感的、</p>
<p>他的出品是很少的、但是己很少的幾部詩亦是很美麗的、有（ＥrosaodPsycee和（ＴheGrowrhofLove）兩部、此外他也出版過兩三部的回憶錄、和文粹、在那裏他啓示出深刻的詩的原理、最近他出版一部（美之聖書ＩheTestanentofBeauty（蕙子）</p>
<h3>美之聖書曼如</h3>
<p>英國桂冠詩人</p>
<p>白列奇作詩篇</p>
<p>從一位佳冠詩人（ＰoetLaureate）底筆下寫出來的長詩、無論批評家底意見怎樣、後世人底判斷如何、在它初出版的時候總是值得注意的、桂冠詩人底地位多少是帶着傳統的神怪意味、而桂冠詩人可是被認爲一國詩人之表率的、在實際上雖不一定如此、尤其是在現代、但桂冠詩人之不會有亂敷衍、則是當然的事、在古時候、國王殿前的詩人、多得很當心的歌功頌德、把皇帝大人寫成他詩篇中的最勇武仁德的人物、至於下朝以後的皇帝、爲人如何、那是不在詩人底職司範圍以内、可以不必加以注意的、到了現在　譬如英國吧、雖然還有皇帝、但那樣的情形是早己過去了、所以桂冠詩人也就没有棒皇帝的必要、不過、在名義上、桂冠詩人到底還是皇帝底御用詩人、所以桂冠詩人底詩還得是（恭呈）皇上底御覽、因爲有這種關係、詩人底作品當然就非優雅敦厚、純正莊嚴不可了、所以桂冠詩人底封之有（美）無（醜）、有（雅）無（俗）、思想高超、趣味清雅、也是當然的事了、</p>
<p>英國桂冠詩人白列奇（ＲoberlBlidges）底作品、就是這麽樣的一種東西、　　他的、新著（美之聖書）（IheTestamentofBeauty）據說是他的最偉大的作品、是他自造的一項桂冠、這話很可以相信、因爲他所有的特點在這部作品裏都表現了出來、而且表現得再充分也没有、辭句之優雅、音節之諧和、組織之緊密、風格之藴藉、確是值得贊美的、但是其中的情的成分太少了、讀者底情愫是很難被他挑起的、這篇作品與其說是像詩。不如說是像哲學論文、或是（聖書）、對於喜歡用詩來陶冶心靈的、這篇作品非常適當而且有價值、但對於那想從詩得到情緒的陶醉的、這篇作品却是不會對榫的、</p>
<p>這篇詩共分四卷和一篇序詩、、詩是用的亞歷山大體、Ａlexaudrin每行十二個綴音）、不按韻全篇頗有彌爾登底那種爽朗的情味、但没有彌爾登史詩底那種戲劇的情致、這篇詩底開頭七行就預先說明了本詩底意旨我們譯在下面、</p>
<p>世人的（智慮）是神怪（天神）底女侍他和命運之神的猜擬難以測知、、</p>
<p>我们度過昌變的海在平静或風暴的</p>
<p>日子</p>
<p>船　嵌前進時、、我們的堅定意志、</p>
<p>好似羅盤箱内的羅盤抖個不住、</p>
<p>我們的穏定祇是均衡、智慧全在、</p>
<p>對於那不可見的加以有力處置、</p>
<p>至於美呢人如要獲得人生之美、就非靈魂灌注在上帝不可、因爲上帝就是美與愛</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Points of Contention in the Japanese Parliament</h3>
<p>Changes in the world's economic tides, the rise and fall of commerce and trade, all shift with the times. Therefore, the ways to respond should not be forced into uniformity. Regardless of what policies are implemented, one must not only consider the national situation but also observe the state of the times. The policies of Europe and America may not necessarily be applicable to Japan. Even in Europe and America, a certain policy could be implemented in one era but not in the next. If those in power are ignorant of this crucial point, they will be trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.</p>
<p>Today, the financial policies being debated in the Japanese Parliament see the opposition attacking the government for having no solutions to the unemployment problem, and accusing the rationalization of industry of benefiting capitalists while not benefiting labor. Prime Minister Hamaguchi's reply is that the purpose of industrial rationalization is to invite the revitalization of industry, which will not only benefit capitalists but also labor. Hamaguchi's words are indeed not without insight. The policy of industrial rationalization was first implemented in the United States, where industry greatly increased and achieved significant results. Germany imitated it, and initially also achieved significant results. However, it was later attacked by labor, which is what I mean by the relationship of the times. Whether the current era in Japan is suitable for the policy of industrial rationalization is something that facts will prove. I will not discuss it for now. I only think that in today's world, when finance is equally difficult, authorities in various countries are suffering from a lack of ability to respond, and the proclaimed adjustment policies are mostly attacked by the opposition. This is not entirely due to the inadequacy of the policies themselves, but also because those who implement the policies do not understand the nature of the times and make few changes. Today's administrative authorities must first understand this meaning before implementing any policies. Can they rigidly adhere to their preconceptions and rashly wield the pen? Industrial policy is just one aspect.</p>

<h3>Wang's Journey North Still Awaits</h3>

<p>(Beiping) The Yishi Bao reported that a certain important person received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that Wang will not come north for the time being and must wait until Yan and Feng arrive in Zhengzhou and the military situation is over before he can go north. Wang plans to leave Hong Kong in early June. Party affairs issues are being discussed back and forth via letters and telegrams by Chen Gongbo and others, and there is no immediate need to go north.

Yan will again send Li Xijiu and Wang Danchen south to welcome Wang. Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, and Bai Yunti will go to Datong and then to Ping within days. Fu Rulin, the current Deputy Director of the General Political Department, will return within days. Ping also said that regarding the organization of the government, Yan advocates that a man of letters be the chairman, but the desire of all parties to promote Yan has not changed. Two departments of finance and foreign affairs will be temporarily established in the headquarters, and two committees of finance and foreign affairs will be established to roughly form the prototype of a government. Yan handed over two seals, one for Deputy Commander and one for Commander-in-Chief of the First Route Army, and sent staff to Tianjin to safely deliver them to Li Zongren in the South. Lu left for Tianjin that evening. (28th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The more the Party affairs issues are discussed, the more entangled they become. There is no date for Wang Jingwei to go north. Yan and Feng are unwilling to get involved in the Party affairs disputes and claim that they intend to negotiate again after the military situation progresses. On the one hand, they are sending Zhao Pilian, Rong Jiasan, and others to vigorously woo Zou Lu, Xie Chi, and others to discuss a provisional government first. Chen, Wang, and others know that the future of the second session of the committee is extremely dim and are now planning to quickly unite with the Communist Party to begin an anti-Yan Feng movement.

<h3>Indian Governor-General Suppresses Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Promulgates Press Ordinances</p>
<p>Bans Advocacy of Revolution</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 27th – The Governor-General of India has promulgated press ordinances, restoring the 1910 Press Act with amendments suitable for the current political situation. The 1910 Press Act deals with writings that incite murder, evil deeds, stir up military unrest, disrespect the British government and officials, and incite hatred towards the British. The Governor-General also published an article stating that the disturbances in Calcutta and Karachi, and the riots in Chittagong and North Shahwa, clearly indicate that the revolutionary spirit not caused by non-violent resistance is gradually engaging in dangerous forms of venting. Currently, the most powerful means to promote this spirit are newspapers that openly instigate the public to revolt and encourage violence. It is hoped that clear-minded and stable elements within the country will cooperate with the government to resist lawless forces and guide the country back to peace.</p>

<p>American News Industry Tycoon Writes to British Prime Minister</p>
<h3>Criticizes Sea Conference Work</h3>
<p>Says Anglo-American Cooperation Cannot Be Thorough</p>
<p>Will Lead to a Second World War</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 28th – American news industry tycoon Hearst today revealed in his newspapers a letter to British Prime Minister MacDonald, heavily criticizing his work at the Sea Conference. The letter states, "We are convinced that your double-dealing has strangled the cause of Anglo-American cooperation, and future facts will prove it. Anglo-American cooperation is more important to Britain than to America. Now, Britain seems determined to join another major war. If Britain is drawn into another major war, the outcome can be predicted as follows: (1) Britain will be blockaded by enemy submarines to the point of starvation; (2) London will be half-destroyed by aircraft bombing; (3) England will eventually be occupied by the enemy, and the capital of the British Empire will be moved to Canada." It also states, "All my newspapers have completely lost faith in the sincerity of British politicians. Only when Britain has the same broad-mindedness and clear awareness of self-interest as its more advanced self-governing colonies, will my newspapers want to make cooperation with England the goal of their newspaper operations."</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Questions War, Opposition Parties Unleash Verbal Attacks</h3>
<p>Listing Difficulties to Censure the Government</p>
<p>Problem of Supreme Command Rights Worsens</p>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 28th – At the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 27th, Yukio Ozaki raised the issue of Minister of Education Kobashi's memorial to the throne, severely attacking the Prime Minister. Mr. Ozaki stated on the podium that Kobashi was derelict in his duty, dismissing it as something that happened before the current cabinet, which is a mistake. If the memorial was submitted out of ignorance, he should feel a great sense of responsibility. If he knew about it and still submitted the memorial, it means that he allowed a criminal defendant of heinous crimes to approach the Emperor, which is a great misfortune unprecedented in the 2,500-year history of Japan. Prime Minister Hamaguchi can be said to lack the concept of a prime minister. The answers given by the prime minister of a monarchy in the upper and lower houses need to be corrected. Viewing Prime Minister Hamaguchi's answers, it is assumed that he was completely unaware of the dereliction of duty before forming the cabinet, which led to the memorial. However, Kobashi was accused of crimes after retiring and has recently been brought to trial, which is truly regrettable. The attack on the Prime Minister was very sharp, causing an uproar in the parliament, with thunderous applause from the opposition parties. Next, Speaker Yoshiei Horikiri took the stage, stating that the impact of lifting the gold embargo was particularly severe. Industrial rationalization contradicts the conservation of consumption. Since the lifting of the embargo, overseas cash has decreased monthly. Although the budget has been reduced by 150 million yuan, the impact of the drop in securities prices and related bonds has reached 15 billion yuan. Where will the people's losses be compensated from? Subsequently, Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Finance Minister Inoue, and Commerce Minister Hyou took the stage in succession to give simple answers. Nobuya Uchida then took the stage to question, stating that the minimum limit of the disarmament conference cannot be ambiguous. How is the London Naval Treaty not a failure? Prime Minister Hamaguchi took the stage again to answer, stating that the content of the exchange of opinions with the Naval General Staff cannot be stated here. The Emperor's report from the Naval General Staff is also not something to be answered in parliament. Although the opinions of the Naval General Staff were consulted, the extent to which they were consulted is deemed unnecessary to answer. Then, Ikuo Oyama took the stage, stating that the Hamaguchi Cabinet is bound by capitalists and landlords, steadily implementing policies, while showing indifference to the relief of farmers and the proletariat, and even acting in the opposite way. I absolutely oppose the reactionary labor union law of the current cabinet. However, the government is currently allowing this type of labor union law to exist. Compensating for unemployment is the responsibility of the government and capitalists. Empty words of sympathy, such as relief for the unemployed, are of no help. Although the government claims to establish or protect employment agencies as a countermeasure to unemployment, the effectiveness of employment agencies is very limited today when the number of unemployed is increasing. Therefore, the capitalist class must be responsible for unemployment relief. Industrial revitalization, if it only increases the profits of capitalists, only exposes the internal contradictions. Unemployment subsidies should be paid from the national treasury, at 1.5 yuan per person per day. The government once spent 100 million yuan on earthquake-related notes to rescue banks. There is no reason why this cannot be done. The government can compensate for silk prices, so why can't it compensate for unemployment? Although the propertied class has no special benefits, they also have no worries about food and clothing. The speech lasted for a while, all from the standpoint of the proletarian citizens and the oppressed masses, criticizing the Hamaguchi Cabinet and attacking capitalism. Finally, it was said that this could also be applied to the Seiyukai party, and then he stepped down from the stage. Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi took the stage to answer, Ikuo Oyama considered it unsatisfactory and questioned again. Prime Minister Hamaguchi did not answer.</p>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 28th – Due to the government disregarding the intentions of the Naval General Staff and agreeing to the compromised London Treaty, the so-called problem of supreme command rights has arisen. Foreign Minister Shidehara's answers to the questions of Seiyukai President Tsuyoshi Inukai and Ichiro Hatoyama contain misleading points. Also, the government is asked how it will take responsibility for national defense that the Chief of the Naval General Staff says he cannot be responsible for, which is also becoming a problem. Therefore, the voices criticizing the government are gradually increasing. The government is aware of this, so it is paying close attention to the trend of this issue and plans to conduct special research before giving a clear answer.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Women's Suffrage Congress</h3>

<h3>Five New Italian Ships Launched</h3>
<p>Reuters, Trieste, 28th – Within a week of Italy signing the London Naval Treaty, five new warships have been launched, including four cruisers and one submarine. Two of the cruisers are 20,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Extraterritoriality Should Not Exist</h3>
<p>Newly Promulgated Laws Do Not Allow Western Countries</p>
<p>Numerous Laws Create Many Abuses</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 27th – Leading figures of the American Association for International Law today advocated that Chinese ports should automatically implement the newly promulgated Chinese laws as a step towards abolishing extraterritoriality in the future. Former American Minister to China Paul Reinsch and Dennis, who formerly served as legal advisor to the Chinese government in Beijing, also strongly advocated that lawsuits and disputes between Westerners and Chinese should be resolved in accordance with Chinese law to resolve the issue of extraterritoriality. The myriad of laws from various countries not only confuses Chinese parties but is also inconvenient for foreigners in China. Wu Jingxiong, the former President of the Shanghai Provisional Court, vigorously advocated the abolition of extraterritoriality, stating that China has promulgated new laws that provide regulations for both civil and criminal cases. Dennis also stated that complying with Chinese laws would not be any more inconvenient than complying with American laws. At the same time, both Chinese and foreign people would benefit from the uniformity of the law. By doing so, the current tense situation could be eliminated invisibly, which is a win-win situation. However, he feared that the Chinese people may not be completely satisfied with this. He also said that he has extreme trust in the promise made to the Chinese people that after the abolition of extraterritoriality, Chinese and foreign people would be treated equally.</p>
<h3>Report on the Meeting to Revise the Covenant</h3>
<p>Geneva Communication, the Committee to Revise the Covenant to Comply with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, was organized by the General Assembly's adoption on September 24, 1929. It specializes in discussing the British representative's proposal at the first committee meeting of the tenth assembly to revise Section 1 of Article 12, Section 4 of Article 13, and Sections 6 and 7 of Article 15 of the Covenant. The committee has a total of eleven members, selected by the Executive Council in January of this year. All members are experts. Here are the names of the members: China Wu Kaisheng, Germany 标骆 Bulou, England 薛西尔 Cecll, France 考脱 Сot, Spain 考比恩 Cobian, Peru 考纳桥 Corneio, Japan 伊籐 Lto, Italy 夏洛亚 Scialoja, Poland 沙加尔 Sokar, and Romania 铁脱来司考瑞典乌籐 Uden.</p>
<p>The meeting was held at 11:00 a.m. on February 25 in the Secretariat Hall of the League of Nations. In addition to the full committee, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations also sent Baonan, the head of the legal division, and Qi Laote, the legal advisor, to participate in the meeting. Xia Luoya was elected as chairman. The meeting lasted for nine days and closed on March 5. The members of this committee were appointed by the Executive Yuan, so their speaking qualifications did not represent any country and were purely of a research nature. The various amendments passed by them do not directly take effect. They will be submitted to the first committee of the General Assembly in September of this year for formal review and further revision. If our country has any opinions on the various amendments passed by this committee, we should prepare early and submit them for discussion at the General Assembly. The attitudes of the various members towards revising the Covenant were quite inconsistent. The British and French members, considering themselves to be great powers, advocated more stringent measures. The German members were most willing to add the meaning of peace to the Covenant. The members from Peru and Sweden strongly advocated increasing the strength of the Covenant. Kai Sheng, because of his love of peace, which is the spirit of our country and the diplomatic strategy of today, agreed with the opinions of the German, Swedish, and Peruvian members in his personal statements during the meeting and considered that increasing the strength of the Covenant would provide a major guarantee to the various members.</p>
<h3>Recommendations of Our Government</h3>
<p>Our government raised an opinion regarding the time of publication of the arbitrators' rulings and court judgments in Section 2 of Article 12 of the Covenant. The original text "(reasonable)" should be changed to a definite time to ensure speed. At the third meeting on the morning of the 26th, Kai Sheng raised this issue to the committee for discussion, detailing the reasons why "(reasonable time)" was unsuitable. Many members agreed with him. Some members even proposed deleting the original text of Section 2 completely because everything was clearly stipulated in Section 1 of Article 12, and the wording "(reasonable time)" was too vague and seemed inappropriate. After a long discussion by the members, the majority said that since Section 1 of Article 12 had been changed, there was no need to revise Section 2. The purpose of this committee was to study the Covenant to make it suitable for the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and other amendments were not within the scope. As a result, it was recognized that the original text of Section 2 did not need to be revised. Kai Sheng consistently argued that the wording "(reasonable time)" should be changed to a definite time. It was later decided to include the Chinese government's intention in the report of this meeting for research by the General Assembly in September. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Foreign Goods Sell Well, Compatriots Quickly Awaken, Especially Cigarettes are a Major Drain on Wealth</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 27th – Mr. Klein, Undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, said in a radio broadcast at 7:00 a.m. today that Asia is the most promising market for the future sales of American goods. Although commodities are small, if they can sell well, they can accumulate into huge numbers. The cigarettes smoked by the Chinese can prove this. Since the European War, trade between the United States and Asia has continued to increase, far exceeding trade with the countries of South America.</p>
<h3>All American Clocks Turned Ahead One Hour</h3>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 27th – The last week of April each year is the period when the United States switches from standard time to daylight saving time. At 2:00 a.m. today, all states in the United States turned their clocks ahead one hour and will switch back during the last week of September. All railways in the country will still operate according to standard time, but new time comparisons will be added to the clock charts.</p>
<h3>Strike Wave Spreads in Japanese Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>China News Agency, Tokyo, 28th – Since the dispute occurred at the Kanebo Hyogo factory, 1,500 male and female workers have been confined to the factory cafeteria, continuing their strike for 17 days. The headquarters of the dispute group planned to break out completely. Yesterday, Sunday afternoon, they resolutely did so. The dispute group all rushed out from the back door to the prepared temporary lodging, where they immediately held a workers' congress. Only a few female workers who were ill and unable to move remained in the factory, which was suddenly desolate. Moreover, the Kanebo Kyoto factory also used canned tactics (i.e., confining workers in the factory) to work hard to appease the workers. However, since the 25th, they have taken a firm attitude and issued dismissal notices to 31 male and female workers who are cadres of the dispute group. The recipients returned the dismissal notices.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Increased Crime in the United States</h3>
<p>Prison Riots Emerge One After Another</p>
<p>New Laws Exacerbate the Situation</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 27th – U.S. Attorney General Mitchell told people today that the prison riots that have emerged in recent months are all due to the overcrowding of inmates in prisons across the country. The reason why there are so many prisoners is due to the large number of new laws, such as Prohibition, which is one notable example. Currently, one-third of the 20,061 inmates in federal prisons are Prohibition offenders, and more than two-thirds of the federal prisoners held in local prisons everywhere are Prohibition offenders. The total number of these offenders has increased fourfold compared to 1926. The second largest number is narcotic drug offenders, and the third is car thieves. He believed that the reason for the increase in federal prisoners is due to the tendency of Congress to exercise legal functions through legislation, while in the past, this power belonged to local officials.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: On the 28th, at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held the 57th weekly memorial service for the late Premier in the main auditorium. Around 500 to 600 people attended, including Central Committee members, officials from various departments and commissions, and guests. Chairman Hu Hanmin presided. After the salutations, the Chairman reported: "Recently, Ms. Luo Xizhen, a staff member of the Central Training Department, was returning home from outside in a rickshaw in the rain. While passing a deep pond near the Party Headquarters, the rickshaw somehow overturned, and Ms. Luo and the rickshaw fell into the water and tragically drowned. Her body and the rickshaw were recovered the next day. However, despite searching all day, the rickshaw puller's body was not found. We can only assume that he fled in fear after causing this terrible accident. Although the rickshaw puller may not have intended any harm, a life was lost, and he should have immediately called for help. Instead, he heartlessly fled, showing a complete lack of awareness. The Party Headquarters is deeply saddened by this unfortunate incident. Regarding the rebellion of Yan and Feng, Chairman Chiang went to the Ping-Han Railway after arriving in Hankou for inspection. We received a telegram yesterday stating that the enemy forces are in disarray and have not made any significant movements, nor do they dare to easily advance. Their internal situation is complex, and changes are expected soon. As for the resolutions passed at the Second National Education Conference, they are extremely important for the construction of education. In the past, educational undertakings have often suffered due to a lack of standardized funding, or because the authorities neglected educational expenses, thus affecting the development of education. This conference, after comprehensive planning and deliberation, has established a reasonable standard for educational facilities and the overall financial situation of the country. At the same time, in addition to school education, more attention is being paid to social education and mass education, so that all people in the country have the opportunity to receive a basic education. Because China must complete political tutelage and then implement constitutional government, this cannot be achieved without universal education. All Party members should understand that in this era of cultural evolution, no one is not an educator, and no one is not being educated. For the illiterate masses, we must fulfill our duty to teach them to read. Every literate person should teach ten illiterate people to read, or at least three or four. Confucius said, 'Enrich them first, then teach them.' I believe that in China's current state, we must teach them first, then enrich them. China has vast land and abundant resources. Agriculture, mining, and animal husbandry have great potential. Yet we are still poor and weak because our people lack the knowledge and ability to develop resources and receive equal education. Therefore, to make the country rich and strong, we must promote education. Comrades serving in the Party, whether in propaganda, training, or guidance, should conscientiously take responsibility and achieve results, which is fulfilling their educational responsibility. Those who can neither teach nor be taught are, as Mencius said, 'rejected by all.' As for phonetic symbols, they are a shortcut to assisting education and promoting literacy. By learning one, you can infer three, avoiding language barriers and various difficulties, making it easier for illiterate people to learn to read and use the written language. Some people think that the invention of phonetic symbols is to abolish Chinese characters, which is a big mistake. The unification of China and the elements of national foundation owe greatly to the written language, which is generally recognized by both Chinese and foreigners." The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>National Government: On the same day, at 10:00 AM, the National Government held its weekly memorial service for the late Premier. Attendees included Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Enhe Batu, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Wang Boqun, Zhu Lühe, Lin Xiang, Zhou Yawei, Chen Yi, Fan Guang, Li Jinlun, Chen Yu, Zhang Wohua, Zheng Hongnian, and more than 200 officials from the National Government's civil affairs and military affairs departments. Chairman Tan Yankai led the salutations, followed by a political report by Secretary Qian Changzhao, which is as follows: (The National Education Conference concluded on the 23rd. The spirit and implementation conditions of the resolutions passed at this conference have been summarized in the declaration. As long as everyone works hard in the future, they can be gradually realized. Today, I would like to discuss a point with everyone, which is the issue of academic atmosphere. Because of the poor academic atmosphere, many young people have been sacrificed. Because of the poor academic atmosphere, reactions have occurred in society, and some parents even think it is dangerous for their children to attend school. If we do not find a way to remedy this situation, what is the future of education? But to remedy it, we must first study the reasons why the academic atmosphere is poor. Now I will briefly talk about a few reasons that I have seen and that are relatively important: (1) The result of laissez-faire. Some people in the education community advocate laissez-faire. They believe that laissez-faire can allow students' instincts to develop as much as possible and can also practice students' organizational abilities. There is some reason to this, but we must know that laissez-faire in universities is acceptable, but it is definitely not acceptable in middle schools. Middle school rules in countries such as England and Germany are particularly strict because a person's self-governance ability is not very strong in middle school, and they do not have a good understanding of society, so they are easily tempted by the outside world and used by others. In addition, a person's laziness is innate. Before a subject has been mastered, most people regard reading as a hardship, and they must be strictly supervised to be willing to work hard. Therefore, middle school rules must be strict. In fact, in our country's current situation, not only middle school rules must be strict, but universities cannot be too laissez-faire. Some foreign universities are laissez-faire because their university students have received very strict education in middle school and have a very good foundation. Even if they are laissez-faire in university, there are not many drawbacks. University students in our country may not have a very good foundation in middle school, and if they are laissez-faire in university, the drawbacks are great. In short, if universities want to be laissez-faire, middle schools must first lay a good foundation. Laissez-faire does have its advantages, but the drawbacks are too great and outweigh the advantages. Our country has been harmed by laissez-faire, so now we have reached the point where we can start but cannot finish, sacrificing many young people, and society has also suffered significant losses. We must never repeat this mistake in the future. (2) Some people who run schools are irresponsible and fear gains and losses. The principal is busy with other things and often does not come to school. Teachers are often absent or late for class. If a school disturbance occurs, they are at a loss. When students have legitimate demands, they cannot find a way to satisfy them. When they have illegitimate demands, they cannot stop them. At the same time, they are afraid of their own position being shaken. Therefore, they do not ask about right and wrong and simply perfunctorily deal with things. As a result, the more irresponsible and fearful they are, the higher the students' arrogance becomes, and the easier it is for disturbances to occur, and school discipline is thus lost. (3) Sometimes the educational administrative organs cannot completely stop student disturbances. If a school disturbance occurs, even if the principal and teachers of the school are willing to take responsibility and deal with it fairly, if the disturbance is still not calmed down or spreads and expands, the educational administrative organs sometimes not only cannot be their backing, but even, in order to perfunctorily deal with the students, oppress the responsible principals and teachers. The reason for this is nothing more than being timid and afraid of offending the students. This situation is very sad, but the prestige of the principals and teachers cannot be maintained. (4) Some people want to control education or have other purposes and often use students as tools. They incite students to do things that they cannot do themselves and incite students to say things that they cannot say themselves. The students are certainly used by them, and perhaps their goals are achieved, but from then on, they cannot but be particularly accommodating to the students, both as a reward and as preparation for using the students again in the future. It is a pity that many young people are used by them without realizing it, and even more young people sincerely and willingly run errands for them, wasting their precious time on activities that are not important, and the academic atmosphere is thus deteriorating. (5) Internal strife and competition among school faculty and staff. Teachers want to become deans, and deans want to become principals. There is only one principal in a school, and there is only one dean. They do not give way to each other, so they engage in political maneuvering. The most convenient way to use maneuvering in a school is to contact students. A contacts a group of students to attack B, and B contacts another group of students to attack A. As a result, the students are sacrificed. General noble teachers cannot bear to see this situation, so they leave one after another, and school discipline is thus weakened. In recent years, many school disturbances have occurred with the above-mentioned background. A pure school is transformed into a place for fighting for power and profit, which is heartbreaking. (6) The trouble caused by a small number of students. In general, if a school disturbance occurs, if it is entirely initiated by the students, after our detailed investigation, the number of students who intentionally cause trouble is always very small. Many are blindly following, and many are forced to participate. In a school with a thousand students, if the discipline is not good, only ten or twenty students who know how to cause trouble can stir up a huge disturbance. Therefore, because school disturbances occur frequently, to say in general that students do not abide by their duties is unfair. In recent years, students have had very few opportunities to seek knowledge. Except for students who intentionally cause trouble and are themselves to blame, we should deeply sympathize with the rest and should not be harsh on them. The above are the important reasons for the poor academic atmosphere in recent years. We must remedy them at the same time so that the academic atmosphere can be restored. First, people in the education community should no longer sing high-sounding tunes and advocate laissez-faire. Even if universities want to be laissez-faire, they must first rectify middle schools. Second, if people who run schools are still irresponsible and fearful of gains and losses, we should find a way to eliminate them. Third, educational administrative organs should be impartial, thoroughly stop student disturbances, and should not be timid. Fourth, we should urge those who control education or have other purposes and use students as tools to immediately realize their mistakes. If they do not realize their mistakes, everyone can rise up and reject them. Fifth, if faculty and staff have internal strife and competition, we should correct or stop them at any time. Sixth, we should find a way to bring the small number of students who cause trouble back on the right track. If they really cannot be influenced, we may as well severely punish them. If these six things are done at the same time, the academic atmosphere will definitely improve, which is of great importance to the future of education in our country. I hope you will pay special attention to it.)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui's Imminent Departure for Russia</h3>
<p>Official Reply Delivered by the Russian Side</p>
<p>Russian Plenipotentiary Designated as Karakhan</p>
<p>Our Personnel Also Determined</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The official reply from the Soviet Union regarding Mo Dehui's attendance at the Sino-Russian conference was delivered to the Special Envoy's Office at 2:00 PM on the 20th, and forwarded to Mo Dehui by Zhong Yu. Although the original text was brief, the meaning was profound. The Chinese translation is as follows: "(Regarding Your Excellency's note concerning Mr. Mo Dehui's appointment as plenipotentiary representative to the upcoming Sino-Soviet conference, scheduled to depart for Moscow on May 1st, etc., our government is aware. At the same time, our government hopes that your government will no longer deviate from the Boli Record regarding the date of the conference, that is, the previously agreed-upon extension.)" Mo Dehui immediately telegraphed the original text to the Central Government and the Northeast Political Committee. On the day the official notification was delivered, Russian Consul Merinikov informed Zhong Yu by telephone that he hoped that the representative Mo would depart as scheduled and not postpone again. Regarding the official reply, it was originally intended to be delivered after the consulate's anniversary celebration, but it was issued earlier for fear of delaying your country's representative's departure. Judging from the reply and the Russian consul's expressed intentions, Russia seems to sincerely hope that Mo Dehui will depart early. However, the chief Russian councilor Izmailov asked Chinese councilor Li Shaogeng to convey to Mo Dehui on the 22nd that the Eurasia through train from Harbin to Moscow departs every Thursday. May 1st happens to be a Thursday, but the train for Mo's delegation is a special train. If two passenger trains departing from Harbin to Moscow and one passenger train departing from Boli on the same day, when three passenger trains arrive at the Siberian Railway, the connection may cause congestion and inconvenience in traffic technology. Therefore, it is hoped that Mr. Mo will leave one or two days later, so that the train schedule can be more easily arranged. However, Mr. Mo is unwilling to postpone again and has decided to depart on May 1st. If there is traffic congestion when passing through Siberia, he will stay near Chita for a while.</p>
<p>Regarding the Russian representative, diplomatic authorities have learned that the plenipotentiary is Mr. Karakhan, and some of the representatives are current and former personnel of the CER, with the following list: Izmailov (current acting Russian director of the CER), Aysmont (former Russian deputy director of the CER), Beckelsky (former chief accountant of the CER), Liljejev (current chief of the CER Land Department), Nechaev (translator for the delegation, current deputy director of the CER Chinese-Russian Secretariat), Melozhev (translator for the delegation, current translator for the Council), Varyunin (railway engineer), and one staff member from the Finance Department, a total of eight people.</p>
<p>The members of our delegation were finalized this afternoon (24th), including four specialized committee members: Liu Zerong (CER Council member), Li Chen (external commissioner), Tu Weiseng (Railway Department commissioner), and Wang Zeng'en (Northeast Cultural Society committee member); four secretaries: Wang Yinchuan (former Governor of Henan Province), Cai Yunchang (chief secretary of the Governor's Office), Zhang Mingzhe (deputy director of the CER Audit Bureau), and Wang Huanwen (Chinese deputy director of the CER Pension Office); four attendants: Sun Wendou (Consul of Shuangchengtzu), Nan Wenming (secretary-general of the Council), Xie Yihang (secretary of the Council), and Ms. Cui Shuyan (translator of the Council); four clerks: Wu Jialu (secretary-general of the Supervisory Board), Feng Jie (secretary of the Council), Qi Zhonglin (translator of the Council), and Tao Guilin (translator of the Council); in addition, there are three servants. Passports were sent to the Russian Consulate on the 25th for application. The Russian Consul promised to issue diplomatic passports. Tonight at 8:00 PM, the Russian director of the CER, Rudyi, held a dinner party at the Railway Club. On the evening of the 25th, Zhang Jinghui and the leaders of the Special Zone gave Mr. Mo Dehui a farewell dinner at the Modern Hotel. On the evening of the 27th, Russian Consul Mei of Harbin gave a farewell dinner at the Railway Club. On the evening of the 28th, Mr. Mo hosted a reception for the consuls stationed in Harbin at the CER Club. On the morning of the 29th, Mr. Mo will attend a farewell party held by various circles at the General Chamber of Commerce. At 8:00 PM, the director of the Chinese Directorate of the Railway Bureau will hold a public banquet at the Railway Club to see him off.</p>
<p>After Mo's departure, the affairs of the Council will continue to be held as usual. The position of acting director is very important. Yesterday afternoon on the 23rd, an telegram order was received from the Northeast Political Committee to appoint Li Shaogeng as acting director. Former acting director Guo F绵 was transferred to the position of supervisor, and former supervisor Liu Zerong was transferred to the position of director, which was formally approved by the Council meeting proposed by Mr. Mo today (24th).

<h3>New Afforestation Plan for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>Three Items Proposed to the Railway Ministry for Approval</p>
<p>The Tianjin-Pukou Railway's preparations for forestry began in the fourth year of the Republic. First, a nursery was established on more than one hundred acres of spare land near Jinan Station to cultivate seedlings. In the sixth year, afforestation sites were selected in the jurisdictions of Liuhe and Jiangpu counties between Puzhen and Huaqiying. At that time, it was planned to purchase one thousand acres of mountain land every year, requiring an annual expenditure of fifteen thousand yuan. By the sixtieth year, sixty thousand acres of mountain land would be purchased, requiring an expenditure of nine hundred thousand yuan. Once afforestation ended, logging would begin, with one thousand acres being rotated between planting and logging each year, which would be sufficient for the railway's use of sleepers and telegraph poles. This was carried out according to the planned steps. Six thousand acres of private mountain land were successively purchased in the Zhutoushan area and planted in order. After the twelfth year, due to the impact of military affairs, funds were not available, and everything was stopped. Since Director Sun Hegao took office, he believed that the use of afforestation was not only important for the railway's need for wood, but also for protecting water sources and benefiting agricultural construction. He vigorously managed it. In the past two years, two replantings have been carried out in the original forest area, which has now become a forest with no spare land. The nearby private mountain land has also been mostly reclaimed by farmers, making it difficult to purchase and impossible to expand. After careful consideration, Sun plans to apply for the right to manage official mountain land for afforestation in accordance with the Forestry Law promulgated by the Mining Department. After dispatching personnel to investigate, a government-owned mountain in the west of Liuhe County, commonly known as Shili Changshan, with an area of approximately 20,000 acres, was found. The waterway can connect to the Chu River and reach the Yangtze River. The soil is fertile and there are few stones, making it an excellent area for afforestation. A detailed afforestation plan has been drafted, which includes the following items: (A) Surveying and utilizing official wasteland for afforestation, starting with Shili Changshan, with a planned completion period of five years. The total cost of seedling cultivation, planting, management, etc., is approximately 49,000 yuan, which is only 2.5 yuan per acre. It is planned to plant 600 trees per acre, and thin out 100 trees every ten years to avoid hindering development. Five thinnings in total, with the wood value estimated at 1,563 yuan per acre after deducting transportation and other expenses. After this mountain is developed, we will investigate the nearby Baili Changshan (i.e., Zhimaling) and the official mountain land near Shaheji and continue to utilize them for afforestation to meet the original target of 60,000 acres and provide for the needs of sleepers and telegraph poles for the entire railway. (B) Utilizing the spare land along the railway for afforestation. Starting from the 20th year, all spare land along the railway, except for those that have been rented out for business and cultivation or that obstruct traffic light or have other special circumstances, will be planted in order. It is estimated that after six years, all the spare land along the railway can be planted. (C) Station scenic forests and railway parks. The railway is more than 1,000 kilometers long and passes through several provinces. There are many scenic spots and historical sites. Many tourists visit every spring and autumn. In addition to the trees and flowers that have been planted at each station, we plan to improve them and survey locations within the major stations for layout to enhance the spectacle. The above three plans have been detailed in the list and submitted to the Railway Ministry for approval. Once approved, they can be implemented in order.</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Summoned to Hankou</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Governor of Jiangxi Province, Lu Diping, was summoned by Chairman Chiang via telegram. Today (25th), he set off for Hankou, accompanied by Peng Shaoxiang, the chief of the Second Section of the Provincial Government, Director Zhou Ziqian, and several guards. At about 9:00 AM this morning, he crossed the river by the Yuzhang ferry and transferred to the Nanxun Railway car to Xun, where he transferred to a ferry to the west. It is reported that the bandit communists in Jiangxi Province are rampant and have reached their peak. The original troops are insufficient for distribution, resulting in them suppressing here and fleeing there, making it difficult to achieve results. This trip will be to ask Chairman Chiang to send troops to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression as soon as possible, and to ask Chairman Chiang to order the provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian to effectively jointly suppress the bandit communists, so as to eliminate them as soon as possible. In addition, he will ask Chiang for instructions on the post-war reconstruction of the counties in the bandit areas of Jiangxi Province, the methods of financial relief, and the direction of all future facilities in Jiangxi Province. After Lu's departure, the members of the Provincial Government specially held the fifth temporary meeting and appointed Lu Xiaochen as acting chairman to preside over everything. (25th)</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Resolution of Gao Guizi's Troops</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The resolution process of Gao Guizi's troops in Zhucheng and Ju counties has been recorded in previous letters. It is now learned that the Central Government, in response to Gao's telegram to Nanjing pleading for forgiveness, has given Gao's troops 100,000 yuan for departure expenses, which was transferred by Ma Hongkui, the commander-in-chief of the Fifteenth Route Army. Gao immediately left for Tai'an to be under Ma's control. Ma returned to Tai'an from Jinan yesterday to handle everything. However, the troops surrounding Zhucheng and Ju counties have not yet been withdrawn, and Gao's troops cannot yet depart. Here is Gao's official letter to the Zhucheng Party Headquarters and legal groups: (To all elders and Party Headquarters of Zhucheng County: Having sent Comrades Pei and Zhang to Ju, I have learned in detail about the intense artillery fire suffered by the people, and I am extremely saddened. I did not know why this incident occurred. After the Central Government sent someone to comfort me, I learned that Chairman Chen had misunderstood something. I immediately telegraphed the Central Government to express my obedience and received a reply that I was deeply understood. Now I am discussing a solution with Commander-in-Chief Ma, and peace will be achieved immediately. Our troops are originally revolutionary tools, and we will sincerely support anything that benefits the people. I am thinking of you, and I cannot express everything in detail. Gao Guizi bows.)</p>
<h3>The War in Guangxi Province Is About to Intensify Again</h3>
<p>Yunnan Province Will Send Two Brigades to Attack Guangxi</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The war in Guangxi Province has been silent for a long time. Recently, the military situation at the front has changed slightly. According to a telegram from Zhu Shaoliang, the commander of the Sixth Route Army, the headquarters of the Sixth Route Army has moved to Liu, Chen Maobingwen's division occupies Dahuangjiang, and the Eighth Route Army bombarded Xuncheng with heavy artillery. The enemy retreated to Binyang. After the Eighth Route Army occupies Guixian, they will jointly attack the remaining enemies in the Guiping area. According to a letter from a military officer of the Sixth Route Army, the various units of our army on the front line are concentrated on the south bank of Guiping, Guixian, and Hengxian, closely monitoring the actions of the enemy troops across the river. Tan Shiyue Sen's brigade of the Sixth Route Army departed from Pingnan to Xun. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, and Yang Dingzhong, the chief of staff, Chen Ce, the commander of the Fourth Fleet, and others departed from Dahuangjiang at 10:00 AM on the 19th to inspect the troops. They walked from the Danan Hotel in Wuzhou to the Xinfu Wharf and departed by the Jianru ship. It is reported that Chen's trip to Dahuangjiang was to inspect the situation and to discuss a plan with Zhu Shaoliang, after which the general attack will begin. The Eighth Route Army is currently focusing on the Guixian area. Yu Hanmou and Xiang Hanping's divisions, which were previously transferred to the Guangdong border, have been ordered to return to Yulin and attack the front of Guixian. Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai's divisions will take charge, and Li and Yu's divisions will be the reserve team. As for the enemy troops, the main force seems to be in Guixian, with fewer troops in Guiping. Relying on the natural dangers of Guiping, only Liang Chaoji and Xu Zongwu's troops of the Gui army are stationed there. Li Zongren and Zhang Fakui's troops are concentrated in Guixian, Yang Tenghui and Huang Shaoxiong's troops are concentrated in Liuzhou, and Bai Chongxi's troops are distributed in Lipu, Xiuren, and Rong, with the intention of taking the route of Zhaoping Majiang to attack Wuzhou. Because the enemy lacks both soldiers and weapons, they are adopting guerrilla warfare tactics, avoiding strength and attacking weakness. One side is taking a defensive position in Guiping. Currently, the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies have finalized a plan to encircle and suppress Zhang and Gui's army. The Central Government has specially appointed Liu Peiquan as the liaison officer for the Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, and Tenth Route Armies. Liu took office in Guangzhou on the 14th and went to Hong Kong to transfer to Yunnan, bringing many gifts from a certain important person in Guangdong to Long Yun, the commander of the Yunnan Army. Liu's return to Yunnan this time is to urge the Yunnan Army to send troops into Guangxi. It is reported that Long Yun, the commander of the Tenth Route Army of Yunnan Province, has agreed to send the 101st and 102nd brigades of the Yunnan Army, which will take the route of Enlong Baise and directly attack Nanning, to attack the rear of the enemy troops in Guixun.

<h3>The Wind and Rain Calamity in Xiangyuan</h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Since the beginning of spring in Xiangyuan, the weather has been unusually erratic, alternating between heat and cold. In recent days, it has been particularly oppressive and dry, almost like midsummer. On the 24th, around 2 AM, a sudden violent wind roared, accompanied by thunder and lightning and torrential rain, like ten thousand horses galloping. Most of the city's electricity and telephone lines were damaged. In one corner of the provincial capital, the losses on land and water were enormous. Numerous houses were blown down and boats overturned. The following is a detailed record of the investigations:</p>
<p>Land Losses: The losses on land were greater than those on the water. In the Eastern District, the entire roof of the rear building of the Demao Public Inn at No. 78 Luoxing Tian Lane collapsed, crushing to death Cai Yukun's seven-year-old daughter, Huaiying, and injuring his second daughter, Aizhong, a female worker named Zhong Luo, and Cai's wife, Luo, who suffered severe head injuries. All were sent to the public hospital for treatment. In the Southern District, Chen Chunqing, a small vendor selling dumplings at the Dung Wharf, was electrocuted by a broken power line. Also, the wall of the sales department of the Minle Grand Theater at Xinjiekou collapsed, injuring driver Ou Haiqing and apprentice Zhou Shaofang, who were both sent to Ren'ai Hospital for treatment. In the Western District, the building of the Songmao Machine Shop at No. 4 Fuqing Street completely collapsed, crushing apprentice Peng Changgeng to death and injuring helpers Zou Gaowu and Ren Sanyou, and apprentice Li Jinkai, all of whom were sent to Ren'ai Hospital for treatment. In the Northern District, the roof of Wang Yuntian's house at No. 5 Zhongfu Yuan collapsed, crushing to death his three-year-old grandson, Shengzheng, and his two-month-old infant, Cezheng. A portion of Cao Renshou's house at No. 29 Youpu Street was also blown down, injuring one person. A large maple tree at the Kalanjing Temple in Liufangling was blown down, landing on Hu Xichu's house at No. 74, fortunately without injuring anyone. In the commercial area, the roofs of the four-story Changjiang Hotel and the glass roof of the Maofeng Rice Mill were blown down into the street. At Yucai Middle School outside Liuyangmen, both dormitories and classrooms collapsed. At the same time, the heavy rain caused the dormitories to flood, turning them into ponds. More than 300 students could not sleep and were all complaining bitterly. Many fell ill due to the wind and rain. Four ancient trees inside the Finance Department and a large camphor tree with a one-foot circumference inside the Confucius Temple were uprooted, damaging several houses. Also, an ancient locust tree planted by Empress Dowager Cixi of the deposed Qing dynasty in the Changsha County government (said to have been planted by Cixi when she accompanied her father, Yulu, who was serving as the prefect of Changsha) was also uprooted, showing the force of the wind.</p>
<p>Water Losses: Due to the extremely strong winds at night and the rising spring tides, about twenty boats anchored in the provincial river had their anchors pulled, overturned, or collided and sank, mostly coal barges from Hengzhou. Whether anyone was injured is currently unknown. Along the river, many shanties had their thatched roofs blown off, leaving the residents with nowhere to live. They are currently being temporarily housed in the Waterside Temple by the Water and Land Police to prevent them from wandering. Water traffic in and out of the province was suspended for one day yesterday. Both wired and wireless communications were disrupted. The fine rain continues today and has not yet cleared (25th).</p>
<h3>Northeastern China Actively Prepares Defenses in Luandong</h3>
<p>Establishing a Temporary Luandong Garrison Headquarters</p>
<p>One Division and Two Brigades Ordered to Depart for Luan</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: After Yan and Feng's rebellion, the attitude of Northeastern China has attracted much attention. Although Zhang Xueliang has convened a meeting of key figures from four provinces, hoping for peace, he is indeed sincere in supporting the central government. In the middle of this month, the "Tunan" steamship carried field artillery, machine guns, and other supplies from Yingkou to Ning. Preparations are now underway for a second batch of military supplies, with various types of ammunition scheduled to be shipped by the end of the month, currently being packed. Meanwhile, a decision has been made to actively fortify eastern Luanzhou, appointing Yu Xuezhong and Ji Jinchun as the overall commander and deputy commander of the temporary Luandong garrison, respectively. Yu came to Shenyang on the 15th to receive instructions and returned to Luanzhou on the 19th. Ji is stationed permanently in Yuzhou. The armored train and other units from Beida Camp, with over a hundred officers and soldiers and ten armored vehicles, were ordered to depart for Shanhaiguan on the 18th. The 1st Cavalry Division stationed in Shanhaiguan, the 4th Infantry Brigade stationed in Huanzhong, and the 20th Brigade stationed in Yixian were all ordered to prepare to depart for Luanzhou. A certain three regiments of the Jin Army stationed in Luanzhou are gathering vehicles at the Luanzhou Railway Station, preparing to return to Tangshan. The Shanhaiguan Railway Station has also placed numerous empty cars, dedicated to transport. Zhang Xueliang believes that Mongolia and Jehol, bordering Chahar, also need to be guarded. He ordered Tang Yulin to return to Jehol and prepare all matters related to defense. When Tang departed on the 19th, he received two million in military expenses. The defense of Funing and other places will be handled by the Jehol Army. The former Northeast Artillery has been reorganized, now consisting of three brigades and one division, with Zou Zuohua serving as the commander of the artillery division. Brigade commanders Qiao, Zhang, and Wang have already been announced. After official appointments are made, they will be distributed between Luandong, Jehol, and Suiyuan to strengthen defensive capabilities. (Zhenri News Agency)</p>
<h3>Northeastern China's Methods for Settling Zhejiang Immigrants</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Due to continuous disasters and poor harvests in Zhejiang Province, the people are displaced and suffering. The chairman of the provincial government, Zhang Jingjiang, sent representative Li Guangyu to Shenyang to contact Commander Zhang Xueliang, requesting the immigration of 40,000 households, totaling 150,000 people, to Northeastern China for cultivation. Zhang submitted the matter to the Political Committee for discussion, and it was decided to first allow the immigration of 400 households (totaling over 3,000 people). After the Political Committee approved, it was handed over to the Liaoning Provincial Government for processing. The Provincial Government then convened various agencies and legal entities to discuss the matter together, deciding to assign them to various counties: 80 households to Shenyang County (5-6 people per household, both male and female), 50 households to Yingkou County, 50 households to Xinmin County, and 20-30 households each to Tie嶺 and other counties. After Zhejiang representative Li Guangyu telegraphed the number of immigrants to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Zhejiang Province allocated 30,000 yuan in cash for travel expenses. They boarded ships on the 20th of this month and traveled north by sea. Shenyang County Magistrate Wang Jiarui, knowing that these immigrants are about to arrive in Shenyang, convened the heads of the Finance and Public Security Bureaus for an emergency meeting at 4 PM on the 21st to discuss settlement methods. It was decided that, as a first step, when these immigrants arrive in Shenyang, the Finance Bureau will allocate funds, and the Agricultural Association will send personnel to provide food and accommodation. Secondly, the 80 households allocated to Shenyang will be assessed by each Public Security Sub-bureau for wealthy households in the villages under their jurisdiction. Each household will settle one immigrant household, providing food and clothing, and the men will work for the wealthy households. After the paddy fields and the fields at Mentai in the west of the city are recovered, methods will be found to distribute them for cultivation. (April 23rd)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Closure of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Zhalainuoer Coal Mine is one of the three major coal mines in Northern Manchuria. Although its coal is not as heavy and long-burning as that of Muling, or as powerfully heating as that of Hegang, its sixteen coal pits produce forty to fifty trainloads per day, supplying the Eastern Railway, making it a major source. Last year, Zhalainuoer was captured by the Russian army, who immediately carried out destruction, damaging all the coal pit water pipes and oil-drawing machines. The pits were flooded with several feet of water. After the war, efforts were made to restore it, but only the ninth pit could be excavated as normal, producing only one or two trainloads per day. The others could not be restored. The Eastern Railway authorities, considering the mine unable to operate, switched to purchasing coal from Suicheng in Russia as a substitute. All the miners and staff of the mine were paid off and dismissed at the beginning of this month. The Zhalainuoer Coal Mine, which had been in operation for many years, is unlikely to be reopened. It is rumored that the Russian intention is that with the closure of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine, Hegang, being far away in the Lower Jiang Tangyuan, is inconvenient for transportation, and Muling's production is small, producing only a dozen or so trainloads per day. If something were to happen, the supply of Russian Suicheng coal would be cut off, the Eastern Railway would feel a lack of fuel, and there would be a danger of trains stopping and transportation being disrupted, allowing the Russian side to do as they please. Therefore, the closure of the Zhalainuoer Coal Mine is very disadvantageous to our side.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Sijing Town Robbed for the Second Time: Sijing Town in this county is a prosperous commercial center. Since being robbed by bandits once before two years ago, local figures have felt that the local defense capabilities are weak and have been organizing a defense corps. Recently, with the bandit robberies in Zhangyan and other places, Sijing has implemented strict precautions. However, today (the 28th), when the Litong steamer traveling from Songjiang to Sijing was passing through Tangqiao, someone from Sijing suddenly claimed that there were more than 200 bandits in the town at about 2:00 PM, led by someone carrying a large white-bordered red flag. The police officers of the town's Public Security Bureau and the defense corps came out to resist, fearing that they would be outnumbered and unable to avoid being robbed. The passengers on the boat dared not continue and returned to Songjiang. The county government also received a long-distance phone call from Xinzhuang, from those who had escaped from Sijing, reporting the bandit situation and requesting the dispatch of troops for rescue. Soon after, a messenger from Sijing arrived in Songjiang and reported to the County Public Security Bureau. County Magistrate Jin, after receiving the report, immediately dispatched two platoons of the county police and consulted with the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Artillery Training Corps of the Central Military Academy stationed in Songjiang to send troops to travel with the police force on the Litong steamer to Sijing to block and suppress the bandits. Li Wenlai, the owner of a certain rice shop in Sijing, happened to be in Songjiang for business. His family sent someone to Songjiang to urge him to return to Sijing. It is heard that the bandits came from Qingpu and landed on the west side of the town and swarmed into the town, robbing all the way to Zhangjing Bridge for four hours. However, there is no confirmed information about the robbery. The water police, after hearing the news, also mobilized warships and rushed to suppress the bandits.</p>

The bandits demanded 20,000 yuan from Ge, ordering him to notify his family to prepare the money for his release. Ge Wenzhi repeatedly pleaded with the bandits, saying that he had no property and would rather die than pay the money. At that time, another bandit interjected and they drove to Sanyang, releasing Ge ashore. Ge has now safely returned home.</p>

Director Cao, feeling that the reputation of the entire bureau had been completely tarnished by the extortion case of his subordinates, handed over the two offenders, Yu and Chen, to the District Court for handling yesterday (the 28th).

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Woman Found to Have Been Kidnapped: Last night (the 26th) at 9 PM, the Anting Defense Corps checked passengers at the Xinxin Hotel in Dongjie and found a young woman with crystal-rimmed glasses and leather shoes to be suspicious. When questioned, she replied that her mother's family name was Wang, she was 22 years old from Pinghu, and she was married to Shen Wusheng, a tailor from the same town, and lived in Shanghai's Jiangyuan Lane. Three years ago, Wusheng abandoned his profession to join the army and has not been heard from since. On the 21st, she met Wang, a shop assistant at a dowry shop, who lured her to visit her hometown, and sent the purchased clothing materials worth 17 yuan to a friend. They took the train to this place and stayed at the Lu family's house in Lujiacun for three nights. On the fourth day, the Lu couple searched her for the 18 yuan she had with her and forced her to marry someone with a certain surname. Because she refused, she was tied with ropes. She shouted for help and escaped to stay at the inn. The Defense Corps, considering the case involved kidnapping, asked the 8th District Office for instructions. District Chief Qian, finding that Lujiacun was under the jurisdiction of another district, refused to accept the case and ordered the suspect to report to the jurisdictional agency.</p>
<p>Change of District Chief in the Third District: The County Government previously received an order from the Provincial Government to transfer Wu Xishou, the chief of the Third District, to the Fifth District, and to appoint Lu Jing to fill the vacant position, causing the heads of various townships in the Third District to jointly petition to retain Wu and reject Lu, causing an uproar. Now, a citizen surnamed Yang from the Third District sent a letter to the new District Chief Lu Jing, exposing the underlying cause of the uproar. Then, a clerk surnamed Xu from the district office met with Lu and proposed conditions, saying that if he did not transfer the clerks in the office, he could guarantee safety. It is heard that District Chief Lu immediately agreed and asked him to pass on the message, and it was decided that he would take office on May 1st.</p>

<p>Large Number of Suspects Arrested: The Chang'an City Security Corps, together with the guerrilla队, arrested Xia Xincai, Zhang Yaolang, Chang Guangsheng, Wang Zizhong, Xia Zhengfang, Liu Sankun, Ji Qiaolin, Wang Rusong, Lu Yingen, Xia Baozong, Ji Songlin, Xia Zhengming, Chang Fusheng, Chen Yusheng, Xia Zhengshu, and Wang Baosheng, a total of sixteen people, at the Wenwu Temple on the 25th. On the 26th, they were transferred to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Bandits Set Fire to Two Homes: The home of Ji Shaochuan, the head of Hedong Township in Rugao City, was attacked by over a hundred bandits at around 12 AM on the 24th. They carried firearms, electric lights, and incendiary materials and set fire to the house. In an instant, more than twenty rooms were reduced to ashes. At the same time, the home of Ji Shaoqing in Shaojiazhuang, Yelin Township, was also set on fire by bandits, burning over fifty thatched and tiled rooms. The total loss for both families is estimated at 1.22 million yuan.</p>
<p>Large Quantity of Barley Seized at Zhanghuang Port: The second branch station and the water police team of Zhanghuang Port seized over five hundred dan (approximately 50,000 kg) of illegally transported barley on the 30th, loaded on ten boats. The goods were immediately impounded, and it has now been decided to sell it at a fair price.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Walking Group Sets Departure Date from Yangzhou: Xie Fensheng and other members of the National Walking Group arrived at the Luyang Hostel in Yangzhou via Dudu River, Liuhe, Yizheng, and Shierxu. They visited various institutions in recent days. On the 26th and 27th, the entire group toured scenic spots such as Tianning Temple and Slender West Lake, taking pictures everywhere to document their journey. They are scheduled to head north along the canal on the 29th.</p>
<p>Primary Schools to Resume Classes on a Set Date: Primary schools in the city and suburbs had been on strike for several days due to unpaid salaries. The county has now raised enough funds for half a month's salaries and distributed them to the Education Bureau. The schools were distributed at the afternoon of the 27th and are scheduled to resume classes on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Fan Pawnshop Robbery Solved: The Hengxing Pawnshop in Fanchuan Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, was robbed the night before last, resulting in a significant loss of jewelry. Chen, the nephew of the pawnshop manager, and Sha, a carpenter working at the pawnshop, were lodging in the pawnshop at the time. Chen made an excuse to go home the next morning, which aroused the suspicion of the pawnshop staff. In the past two days, the actions of the carpenter Sha have also been quite suspicious. They were beaten and interrogated for a long time, and they finally confessed that they had only received three jin ten liang (about 1.85 kg) of pure gold jewelry, and the rest was taken away by Chen. Sha's stolen goods have been completely handed over, but Chen has already fled and cannot be recovered. The manager of the pawnshop sent a telegram to the owner of the pawnshop in Zhenjiang yesterday to request instructions.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Organizing a Home Guard: Due to the rampant banditry in the villages west of Linhai, especially in Huangshadianxi, local people have jointly discussed the matter and decided to add forty members to the home guard to defend themselves. The expenses will be borne by the local community and should be implemented soon.</p>
<p>Troops Dispatched to Suppress Clan Fighting: The Huang, Sha, Gao, and Xie clans in the villages west of Linhai have recently started a conflict over a minor matter. Both sides gathered and engaged in clan fighting, injuring many people. Jiang Zhiying, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team stationed in the city, learned of the matter and dispatched two companies of troops to suppress the fighting yesterday (the 24th).</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Chief of Public Security Sub-bureau Arrested: Wu Ming, the chief of the Wangjiangjing Public Security Sub-bureau in Jiaxing, has not been properly managing police affairs, and local people have many complaints. Recently, he has been imposing fines arbitrarily for various cases without issuing receipts. Local people have now listed the charges and filed a complaint with the province. After an investigation, the province ordered the county government to instruct the County Public Security Bureau to arrest Wu and place him under custody at the County Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, the case was sent to the local branch court for legal investigation. After the prosecutor opened the court for interrogation, Wu Ming was returned to the County Public Security Bureau for custody.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Increase Again: The price of rice in Jiaxing has gradually increased to sixteen yuan per shi (approximately 94 kg). The Rice Price Evaluation Committee tried to limit it, temporarily setting the price at sixteen yuan to maintain people's livelihood. However, at the sixteenth Rice Price Evaluation Committee meeting the day before yesterday, rice merchant representative Gao Yingjing reported that the wholesale price of winter rice was sixteen yuan eight jiao five fen (1.685 yuan) and that they were unwilling to sell it at that price. Therefore, they requested a price increase. After repeated discussions, the meeting decided to order rice merchants to temporarily maintain the original price until May 3rd. It was stipulated that winter rice, white rice, and pointed rice would each be priced at sixteen yuan per shi, and foreign rice would be priced at fifteen yuan five jiao per shi, with no deviations allowed. However, soon after the decision was made, some rice merchants, such as so and so, verbally notified their colleagues on the morning of the 28th that they would increase the price of rice by four jiao per shi without authorization. As a result, the rice price set by this committee was ineffective.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>County Government Raises Construction Bonds: The County Government, following an order from the Provincial Department of Construction, is raising 180,000 yuan in construction bonds. County Magistrate Shen first sent a letter to agencies, organizations, gentry, and merchants to organize a Construction Bond Raising Committee, which will then hold regular meetings to solicit donations.</p>
<p>New Silkworm Seed Farm Established in the City: Jiashan has never produced its own silkworm seeds. They have either come from local species from Xinchang and Shengxian or have been sold by merchants from Yuhang. The quality of the silkworm season depends entirely on the quality of the silkworm seeds. Recently, silkworm industry experts Ms. Wu Renzhao and Ms. Yao Shumen have invested in and organized the Jiashan Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm in the south of the city with over twenty years of experience in the silkworm industry. They will personally supervise, cultivate, and select improved cocoon seeds from excellent original seeds that are praised by silk mills for their rich silk content and strong silkworms, and sell them to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other regions. Many people have heard of them and are making reservations daily. It is said that the price of cocoons raised from these improved seeds is much higher than that of ordinary cocoons.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Du Accused of Malfeasance: County Magistrate Du Shihua of Xiaoshan previously arrested Shen Zengfeng, a member of the Eastern Township Changxiang Village, and detained him for several days without interrogation. He did not obtain permission from the local senior Party department beforehand. The First Branch of the Second District telegraphed the County Party Department to handle the matter, claiming that the County Government had violated Party discipline. The County Party Department investigated and confirmed that the Party member had not committed any legally criminal acts and sent a letter to the county government to release him. Recently, Shen Zengfeng has accused County Magistrate Du Shihua of acting illegally and derelicting his duty, claiming that human rights are not protected, and has filed a lawsuit with the County Court, requesting Prosecutor Yang to file a public prosecution based on the two crimes of malfeasance and abuse of arrest. After receiving the complaint, the Prosecutor's Office summoned both parties for a court hearing at 1 PM on the 25th.</p>
<p>District Offices Scheduled to Be Established on May 1st: The district offices of Xiaoshan County have been officially established on May 1st. County Magistrate Du has appointed the six district chiefs: Xu Yuanzhang, chief of the First District; Huang Zuluo, chief of the Second District; Wang Jie, chief of the Third District; Ge Shiyou, chief of the Fourth District; Zhu Zhiyang, chief of the Fifth District; and Yu Bin, chief of the Sixth District. The existing self-government instructors are required to transfer all unfinished work to the district offices for takeover before the 30th of this month.</p>
<p>Poor Silkworm Harvest in Dongzou: Farmers in the Nansha area of Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, mainly rely on sericulture as a sideline occupation. This year, the local Silk Cocoon Cooperative purchased Japanese silkworm seeds from Shanghai and distributed them to farmers for cultivation, totaling more than 3,000 sheets. However, the weather after Guyu (around April 20) was abnormal, with alternating periods of extreme cold and sultry heat, and frequent thunderstorms. Many young silkworms died, so the harvest will inevitably be greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Prelude to Park Construction: Parks are one of the components of material construction, and now various counties are successively constructing them. Wuyu (Shangyu) is still lacking. Recently, residents Qian Youlan and Liu Hao, etc., proposed the matter to the administrative meeting, which resolved to forward it to the County Construction Committee for implementation. Wang Jilao sent a letter to Fan Yunshu, agreeing to purchase more than ten mu of land outside the southern suburbs that he owned as the foundation for the park. The construction funds will be allocated from the construction funds of the Mass Education Center by Director of Education Che Mingluan in consultation with the Preparatory Committee of the Mass Education Center, which has been allocated two thousand yuan. It was heard yesterday that the Construction Committee is planning to hold a meeting to discuss the project plan.</p>
<p>Clarifying Misunderstandings About the Suspension of Land Reporting: The County Government previously received a telegram from the Provincial Department ordering that land reporting be completed by the end of April. For a time, there were rumors among the people that those who had already handled it had stopped, and those who had not handled it had slowed down. County Magistrate Zhang Jingxu went to the Provincial Civil Affairs Department on the 13th to inquire about the meaning of the so-called "deadline of the end of April," which was for the purpose of reviewing the reporting work over the past year and determining follow-up methods. Moreover, this matter is of great importance to the livelihood of the people, and it is not appropriate to abandon it halfway. A notice was issued to the public on the 25th.</p>
<p>Bandit Suspect Temporarily Released on Bail: On the evening of the 14th, the home of He Caizhao in Shan'ao, Dongxiang, was robbed by bandits. The day after the incident, a suspect named Ye Liangen was apprehended. At the same time, Judge Zhu Yao came to inspect the scene and found a bandit's umbrella engraved with the name "Fu Chai Defu, Mojiashu Village, Shangyu-Xinchang border." An investigation was launched, and it was confirmed that such a person existed. The county defense team stationed in the city, together with the security team, rushed to the village and escorted him to the county government for interrogation. He claimed that he was a farmer with four brothers, one of whom was teaching at the nearby Houtou Elementary School. His brother took the umbrella to the school, which was robbed last year. It was raining at the time, and the bandits took the umbrella along with them. He did not expect that this would lead to trouble. An order was issued for his detention. His family, hearing the news, sought help everywhere. On the afternoon of the 26th, Xu Guoren from the Civilian Factory temporarily released him on bail.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Continued Interrogation in the Fengqiao Riot Case: A riot occurred in Fengqiao Town, Zhuji, on the 25th. It is now reported that there were sixty or seventy bandits involved that day. They first cut the telephone lines and went to the anti-smuggling camp, where they robbed three guns. They then went to the public security sub-bureau, searched and robbed firearms, and beat policemen Chen Xiang and Luo Cheng to death. Then, they went to the market and destroyed and robbed the Jiahe and Chen Songmao rice shops and went to the Hengda General Merchandise Store, taking away a large number of straw hats. Afterwards, more than thirty bandits had lunch near the Ginkgo tree and left in the direction of Ruanjiabu. According to the County Detective's report, the bandits in Fengqiao have not completely retreated, and there are slogans in Dagouxi Village above Xiejiaqiao calling for the overthrow of the village committee and the land reporting office.</p>
<p>Extortion Case Involving Rice Merchants in City and Countryside: Rice prices in Shaoxing have been soaring repeatedly due to a lack of supply and poor harvests, causing extreme hardship for the people. Recently, rice merchants in the city and countryside, such as Zhao Wanchun in Kezhen, Song Jitai outside Wuyunmen, and Sanyu Xintaiyuan and other rice shops in the urban area, have received anonymous threatening letters demanding that they set fair prices within a limited time or face destruction. The matter has been referred by the County Chamber of Commerce to the County Government for investigation. Due to the connection with people's food and public security, County Magistrate Tang has issued a notice promising to find ways to provide relief.</p>

<h3>The Strength of the Philippines in the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Officials and Athletes... All Decided</p>
<p>Early May... Departing for Japan</p>
<p>Basketball and Volleyball are the Strongest, Will Face China in the Finals. Track and Field Long-Distance Running is Not as Good as Japan, Soccer Can Win the Runner-up. Whether or Not the Championship Can Be Obtained Depends Entirely on Swimming and Baseball. Swimming Has a Strong Japanese Enemy, and Chinese Baseball is Also Formidable (Manila Correspondence). Since the last Far Eastern Games in Shanghai, the Philippines have been very enthusiastic and determined to avenge their defeat in this year's games in order to win the Far Eastern hegemony and capture the Emperor's Cup, to promote the bravery of athletes from the equatorial country. This year, the Philippine Islands began preparations for the Games the earliest, starting with local preliminaries in January. In February, a carnival was held in Manila, bringing together the best athletes in the country. The results were amazing, and new records were frequently set. The Philippine Islands will send a total of more than 160 athletes and other personnel to Japan, led by Deputy Secretary of Agriculture George. They will arrive in Yokohama in early May. All schools in the Philippines are now on vacation. Due to the local climate, the summer vacation is from March to June every year. Taking advantage of this great opportunity, various sports are being carried out enthusiastically. All the Philippine athletes are living together in the training center in Manila, and specialists are directing their training every day. The various competition committees of the Philippine Islands are as follows:</p>
<h3>(1) List of All Staff Members</h3>
<p>(Head of the delegation) Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Mr. George, Mr. Bitchi, Dr. Rippino</p>
<p>(Track and Field Committee) Mr. Silafan, Mr. Fuqulu Lunate, (Former Philippine University Sprinter) Mr. Nicodti, Mr. Niu Man (U.S. Army)</p>
<p>(Swimming Committee) Mr. Gadi, (Philippine University) Mr. Hewaqi (Youth Association)</p>
<p>(Baseball Committee) Mr. Fulan, (Philippine University) Mr. Mariano</p>
<p>(Tennis Committee) Dr. Bigutuo Lu</p>
<p>(Basketball Committee) Mr. Birdo</p>
<p>(Volleyball Committee) Mr. Bablu, Ms. Carmen</p>
<p>(Soccer Committee) Mr. Tidyuqiu Mixin</p>
<h3>(2) Strength of Various Competitions</h3>
<p>According to a conversation with Dr. Ilanan, President of the Philippine Athletic Association (P.A.A.F.), the Philippine athletes in the non-official boxing event that has been added this year will probably have no opponents. In official competitions, Japan has the most hope in track and field and tennis. China is confident in soccer. The Philippines is the strongest in basketball and volleyball. Therefore, whether or not the Philippines can win the championship this time depends entirely on swimming and baseball. Unfortunately, there has been a dispute among the Philippine swimming athletes, and baseball is gradually declining. At the last Far Eastern Games, the Philippine baseball team was completely wiped out. Last year, the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun baseball team defeated the entire Philippine Islands in an expedition. Dr. Ilanan also said that even Japan is not optimistic about this year's games and will inevitably have a tough fight with the emerging China. According to reliable sources, the strengths of the Philippine athletes in various competitions are as follows:</p>
<h3>(3) Track and Field Short-Distance Running Has Surprising Performances</h3>
<p>The Philippines has always been known for its short and medium distances, with the most outstanding athletes. Because long-distance running is not as good as Japan, it has recently lost many track and field championships. Its short-distance running often has surprising performances. For example, Mr. Shenzhaga's 100-meter time, with the wind, is 10.4 seconds, equalling the world record. Other athletes in hurdles, high jump, and high hurdles are also admirable. Its various track and field results are as follows:</p>
<p>(100 meters) Mr. Shenzhaga (10.5 seconds), Mr. Shebom (10.7 seconds), Mr. Mijianuoer (10.8 seconds), Mr. Handabi La (2 seconds)</p>
<p>(200 meters) Mr. Shenzhaga (22 seconds), Mr. Badieyi La (22 seconds), Mr. Alubabo, Lan (22.4 seconds), Mr. Miyijianuoer (22.6 seconds)</p>
<p>(400 meters) Mr. Alubabo Lan (50.7 seconds), Mr. Heyide (52 seconds)</p>
<p>(800 meters) Mr. Yadaer (2 minutes 1.3 seconds), Mr. Gulie (2 minutes 3 seconds), Mr. Kuolisi Debaer (2 minutes 3.6 seconds)</p>
<p>(1500 meters) Mr. Yadaer (4 minutes 15.9 seconds), Mr. Basin (4 minutes 17 seconds)</p>
<p>(10,000 meters) Mr. Die La Gu Luo Si (36 minutes 35.4 seconds), Mr. Shen Xianfu Zuo (36 minutes 36 seconds)</p>
<p>(High Hurdles) Mr. Jiaxiya (15.7 seconds), Mr. Abiyen La (15 seconds, 6), Mr. Alubalan (15.9 seconds)</p>
<p>(Low Hurdles) Mr. Jiaxiya (25.2 seconds), Mr. Abiyen La (25.4 seconds)</p>
<p>(Long Jump) Mr. Jia La Rude (6 meters 70+ centimeters)</p>
<p>(High Jump) Mr. Deribiou (1 meter 94 centimeters), Mr. Die La Lu Si (1 meter 93 centimeters)</p>
<p>(Triple Jump) Mr. Deribiou (13 meters 96 centimeters), Mr. Oulalio (45 feet 1 inch)</p>
<p>(Pole Vault) Mr. Yasanzuo (3 meters 50 centimeters)</p>
<p>(Javelin Throw) Mr. Biliesi (170 feet)</p>
<p>(Shot Put) Mr. Luyan Zhi (46 feet)</p>
<p>(Discus Throw) Mr. Luyan Zhi Yan Si Jia Lan Di, Mr. Shamanuo (Each 110 feet to 120 feet)</p>
<h3>(4) Unreliable Swimming Athletes</h3>
<p>Since the 6th Osaka Games to the 8th Shanghai Games, the Philippines have won swimming championships as easily as picking things out of a bag. Therefore, the Philippine Islands are quite proud of swimming competitions. However, the unfavorable aspect of this year's Games for the Philippines is that the Games are in May, and the climate of Japan and the Philippines is very different. Philippine athletes are mostly afraid of the cold, which may prevent them from defeating Japan. This year, nine outstanding Philippine athletes have withdrawn from the delegation due to unfair judging during the preliminaries and cannot participate in the Games. Japanese outstanding athletes will never go to other countries to compete before the Far Eastern Games open. This may prevent the Philippines from defeating Japan again. According to general speculation, Japan has a 60% chance of winning the swimming championship this year, and the Philippines only has 40%. The Philippine athletes' records in various events are as follows:</p>
<p>(50 meters) Mr. Wuerjia, Mr. Ali (Each 57.5 seconds), Mr. Shanweng Gusi Zhi (58 seconds), Mr. Haijialiya (58.5 seconds)</p>
<p>(100 meters) Mr. Shanweng Gusi Zhi, Mr. Wuerjia (Each 1 minute 4 seconds), Mr. Haijialiya (1 minute 6 seconds)</p>
<p>(400 meters) Mr. Ali (5 minutes 47 seconds), Mr. Shanweng Gusi Zhi (5 minutes 38 seconds)</p>
<p>(1500 meters) Mr. Shanweng Gusi Zhi (23 minutes 8 seconds), Mr. Iludidifu Ouson (23 minutes 37 seconds)</p>
<p>(200 meters Breaststroke) Mr. Iludidifu Ouson (2 minutes 52 seconds), Mr. Alubate (3 minutes 2 seconds)</p>
<p>(100 meters Backstroke) Mr. Dabi Er (1 minute 16 seconds)</p>
<p>The above records are all from competitions in 25-meter swimming pools.</p>
<h3>(5) Baseball Team Plans to Avenge the Shame</h3>
<p>This year's Philippine baseball team has undergone careful selection and painstaking training, intending to avenge the shame of Shanghai. Most of the representative athletes this time are selected from the Customs Bureau. The names of the athletes are as follows:</p>
<p>(Pitcher) Mr. Ramon (Ateneo University), Mr. Bi Bin Xiou (Philippine University), Mr. Xi Yan Sim (Customs Bureau), Mr. Ma Qilaya (Customs Bureau)</p>
<p>(Catcher) Mr. Mali Yano (Philippine University) Mr. Fu Yan Lixi Yano (Customs Bureau), Mr. Pulaton (Navy), Mr. Fu An (Customs Bureau)</p>
<p>(First Base) Mr. Demi Nan Duo Er (Philippine University) Mr. Folan Xi Sige (Customs Bureau), Mr. Fu An (Customs Bureau), Mr. Bai Li Si (Santo Tomas University)</p>
<p>(Second Base) Mr. Yuge (Customs Bureau), Mr. Fuaru Lan (Philippine University), Mr. Yigunan Xiou (Customs Bureau)</p>
<p>(Third Base) Mr. Bi Lu Nali Si (Customs Bureau), Mr. An Xi Lu Mao (Customs Bureau), Mr. Shen Lie Ge Li Ou (Customs Bureau)</p>
<p>(Shortstop) Mr. Bi Xian Tie (Customs Bureau), Mr. Bade Li Xi Ou (Customs Bureau)</p>

<p>(Right Field) Mr. Francisco (Philippine University), Mr. Gula Xilu (Customs Bureau), Mr. Bado Lixiya (Customs Bureau)</p>
<h3>(6) It May Be Difficult to Win the Tennis Championship</h3>
<p>Philippine tennis has won several championships in the history of the Far Eastern Games, but it has recently declined and has been repeatedly suppressed by the Chinese and Japanese armies. At this year's Carnival, China defeated the Philippine athletes, and Japan defeated the Chinese athletes again. The best athletes in the Philippine Islands are the Arasin brothers. Due to their professional relationship, it is difficult to predict whether they will be able to participate. In future Games, it may be difficult for the Philippine Islands to win the championship. The results of the three-nation final at the Manila Carnival are recorded below, and the strength of the Philippine Islands can be known.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (China) 6 vs. 1, 7 vs. 5, 6 vs. 8, 7 vs. 5, Yamazaki (Philippines)</p>
<p>Bu Jing (Japan) 6 vs. 1, 6 vs. 0, 5 vs. 7, 6 vs. 0, Lin Hua (China)</p>
<p>Sato (Japan) 6 vs. 4, 6 vs. 3, 8 vs. 6, Son Ka Ruo (Philippines)</p>
<p>Bu Jing (Japan) 6 vs. 1, 7 vs. 5, 4 vs. 6, 8 vs. 6, Arasin (Philippines)</p>
<p>Sato (Japan) 6 vs. 3, 6 vs. 1, 6 vs. 1, Bali De (Philippines)</p>
<p>The names of the Philippine tennis representatives this year are as follows:</p>
<p>(Men) Arasin Brothers, Luo Bu, Mr. Bali De, Mr. Fu Yan Li Gu Si</p>
<p>(Women) Ms. Rosa Rio, Mrs. Ou Zhao Wa, Ms. Bi Duo La</p>
<h3>(7) Soccer Can Win the Runner-up</h3>
<p>The strength of the Philippine soccer representatives this year is very great, several times better than Japan. This year's Games still have the hope of winning the second place. There are many rising stars among the reserve athletes. Four of them have previously participated in the Shanghai Games. The names of the representatives were officially decided in early April. They are currently gathered in Singapore and practicing intensely every day. The names of the athletes are as follows: (Those marked with ▲ are those who previously participated in the Shanghai Games)</p>
<p>Ba Si Jia Er, Mr. Wuyi La Nu Yan Ba, Mr. So Di Lu, Mr. Mei Die Er ▲, Mr. A Lu De Na Jia, Mr. Bi Li Zhi, Mr. A Yan Zha, Mr. Jia Zhi Man, Mr. Wen La Li Lu, Mr. Zhi Dan Jia, Mr. A Li Jia, Mr. Duo Lun Qin ▲, Mr. Men Fu Weng Te, Mr. Wu Jia Duo, Mr. Wu Zhi Ru, Mr. Li Ou</p>
<h3>(8) Basketball Has China as an Enemy</h3>
<p>Basketball is the Philippine's most successful competition. It has won the Far Eastern Championship many times. Recently, China's basketball strength has also become very strong, so the Philippines considers China a strong enemy. At the previous Games, China suffered a defeat due to a one-point difference. In this year's basketball game, China and the Philippines will inevitably have a fierce and bloody battle. The names of the Philippine representatives are as follows: Mr. Zouni (Philippine University), Mr. Xi Luo Mi Nuo, Mr. Ba Wuzhi Shi Deng, Mr. Wei Ya Nu Yan Ba (Philippine University), Mr. Ba Si Ji Si, Mr. Jia Si Di Yi Lu (Philippine University), Mr. Xian Lie Si Zhi Nuo (Philippine University) , Mr. Die Lu Luo Shan Li Ou (Santo Tomas University), Mr. Xiu Lu Meng (Philippine University)</p>
<h3>(9) Volleyball is Tied with China</h3>
<p>Both men's and women's volleyball teams in the Philippines are good. They have achieved remarkable results in the Far Eastern Games. Japan is afraid of competing with the Philippines, and China is on par with it. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who will win the championship this year. The names of the representatives are as follows:</p>
<p>Bi Duo Er, Mr. Man Xi La, Mr. Gu Lu Si, Mr. Ya De Ke, Mr. Sha Luo Wa, Mr. Jia Si De Er, Mr. A Lu Gang Da La, Mr. Man Sun, Mr. Da Yan Jia, Mr. Li Si, Mr. Ma Jia Duo A Qi Duo, Mr. Jia La Wa Si, Mr. Zhou An Ma, Mr. Lu Qin Si, Mr. Ba Na Duo, Mr. Bi La</p>
<p>Among the women's volleyball athletes in the Philippines, there are three Philippine University students, five Philippine Women's University students, four Republic University students, four Normal School students, and three Philippine Columbia Club members. All female athletes are now being directed and trained by Ms. Ilanan, who is currently a female physical education professor at the Philippine University. (April 25)</p>

<p>Attendees: Chairman He Siyuan (Director of the Education Department), Honorary Vice-Chairmen Yu Enbo (Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining), Chen Mingyu (Director of the Department of Industry and Commerce), Zhu Xi (Director of the Department of Civil Affairs), Chen Luanshu (Director of the Department of Construction), Yuan Jiapu (Director of the Department of Finance), Zhang Jinjian (Training Director of the Provincial Rectification Committee), and representatives from other agencies, all staff of the sports meet, etc.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: The ceremony started as scheduled at 10:00 AM. Chief Commander Zhang Yiguang, Chairman He Siyuan presided over and delivered the opening speech, which briefly stated: Fellow comrades, fellow students, fellow athletes, we are holding the first provincial middle school joint sports meet here today. Know that this is not for individual sports, but for the entire Chinese nation's sports. Our Chinese nation has a history of 4,000 years. Recently, our culture has fallen behind and our politics are oppressed. The biggest reason is that the nation is not competitive. The reason why the nation is not competitive is because it lacks team spirit and team morality. This meeting is to show the development of the entire Chinese national spirit and the development of the entire Chinese national morality. It is not about one victory or defeat. It is about uniting and going on. This is the expression of the development of the national spirit. Understand this, and you will know that victory is not worth celebrating and defeat is not worth shame. The main idea of today's meeting is like this.</p>
<p>Next, Vice-Chairman Yuan Jiapu delivered a training speech on behalf of the provincial government, which briefly stated: Today, students are here for a meeting, not for individual sports, but for national sports. Because our Chinese nation does not exercise regularly, it gradually becomes weak, leading to internal and external troubles, and cannot enjoy freedom, equality, and happiness. If this continues, it will not only lead to national subjugation but also extermination. Therefore, sports and nationalism have a direct and great relationship. Next, Zhang Jinjian, training director of the Provincial Rectification Committee, gave a training speech. After the speech, photos were taken, and the parade began.</p>

<h3>Qingdao University President and Funding Confirmed</h3>
<p>President Yang Zhensheng... Annual Funding of 480,000 Yuan</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) The preparation of National Qingdao University has been going on for a year, but due to various difficulties, it has not been established and started school. This time, at the National Education Conference held in Beijing, education figures gathered and all agreed that the establishment of Qingda University should not be delayed. It was initially decided that Yang Zhensheng would be the president of Qingda University. The preparation of everything has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Mr. Yang is a native of Penglai, Shandong Province, a graduate of Peking University, and a graduate of Columbia University in the United States. He is currently the director of the liberal arts department of Tsinghua in Beiping. Yesterday, the provincial government received a telegram from Beijing stating that the National Government had officially announced Yang as the president of Qingda University. After Yang finishes his work at Tsinghua in Beiping, he will go to Qingdao to start preparations. It is heard that school can be started after the summer vacation. The university's budget has been approved by the Ministry of Education's administrative meeting, with an annual funding of about 480,000 yuan. The source of funding is 360,000 yuan from the Shandong Provincial Government in the 19th year [of the Republic] (including 80,000 yuan for start-up expenses), 36,000 yuan from the Qingdao Municipal Government annually, and 12,000 yuan annually from the Jiaoji Railway. The original amount was 30,000 yuan, but it was reduced to 12,000 yuan due to Japanese accountants interfering. The remaining 80,000 to 90,000 yuan will be allocated by the central government. The university has decided to first establish colleges of arts and sciences. The education department has decided to establish a department in Jinan to train rural normal school teachers. Qingda University has decided to run a summer school in Qingdao during this year's summer vacation, summoning a portion of the education bureau chiefs, county supervisors, and elementary school teachers from all 107 counties in the province, as well as all elementary school teachers in Qingdao, to the school for training. Party and state dignitaries such as Cai Yuanpei will also come to the school to give lectures. All the teachers of the summer school have been hired by Yang Zhensheng in Beijing.</p>

<h3>Random Talks in the Capital by Lu Shu-yun</h3>
<p>The Qinhuai River has been known as a land of beauties since ancient times. The Six Dynasties were filled with gold dust. In the south, the courtesans of the Changban Bridge and the Wuyi Lane made their names with songs and music. The pipa has aged. The enchanting scenery has been passed down as an anecdote. Ever since the Hongwu era, (Yu Tanxin's "Banqiao Miscellaneous Records" from Putian states that in the early years of Hongwu, sixteen buildings were built to house official courtesans. Light makeup and powder were used to welcome guests. It was called a romantic affair of the time, etc.). Five or six hundred years have passed with frequent changes and vicissitudes. The beauties have turned to yellow earth, the famous scholars to green shirts. A place of merriment has long been covered with lush grass. Scattered anecdotes and past events remain vaguely. Although the flowing customs of the Jiangzuo region have not faded away to this day, the guests and visitors from all over the world, selecting songs and beauties, after the Yang'a dance, are not as prosperous and splendid as they used to be. Now that the prohibition of prostitution is strictly enforced, the flower affairs have become even more desolate. The old courtyards and riverside pavilions have been turned into dusty markets. The painted boats of the Qinhuai River have been turned into floating homes for scholars. (In the old days, there were tea boats and painted boats moored in front of the Confucius Temple and in the Qinhuai River. The painted boats, such as Fuxing, Yuelai, and Desheng Taoyuan, all had carved railings and painted eaves, with horned lanterns on top. The skirts and hats, the sound of sheng and xiao, and the lights were dazzling. I saw them four or five years ago. Now, the phoenix has left the building empty, and it has all become the residence of ordinary people.) The bright moon is not constant, and the colorful clouds are easily scattered. The Six Dynasties are like a dream, and all that remains is to wander around. Those prostitutes in the old days who knew a little about music gathered in tea houses to sell their songs under the guise of "proofreading," thus avoiding the eyes and ears of the government. The tea houses in the Confucius Temple area also sold songs by female entertainers. The ban did not apply to them, and they profited from their singing and dancing, which were able to attract customers. They all competed to recruit them to run Qingchang. The lights of the Fanlou restaurant, with a profusion of silk and bamboo instruments, more than a dozen singers dressed up and took the stage, singing in response to each other, their pearly throats and fan shadows creating a drunken and mesmerizing atmosphere. From noon to midnight, the seats were always full, and the sound of sheng and xiao never ceased. Their prosperous careers have lasted for a long time without declining. This is because after the prohibition of prostitution, many of those who used to solicit customers have disappeared and hid, and dare not openly offer their smiles. On good days in spring and autumn, those who pursue pleasure recall the past, and there is no lack of emotion and sighing. It can be said that these few tea houses have become the only places of merriment. However, the beautiful women are in groups, and the powder and rouge are like clouds. Their beauty and skills are not uniform, and it is not easy to find those who are both beautiful and talented. For example, Li Lanfang of the Linfeng Pavilion, Zhang Xinhong and Lu Yanqiu of the Tianyun Tower, and Xiao Yu, who used to belong to the Qifang Pavilion and has now left Beijing, are all known for their graceful manners and mellow voices, and can be regarded as the leaders among their peers. Below Deng Kuai, they are just ordinary beauties. Recently, a certain small newspaper, under the pretext of appreciating art and promoting song and dance, has launched a "Capital Song and Dance Star Election." Their leisure and elegance have not been forgotten. I imagine that when the winners are announced and awarded with flowers, there will be a good story to add color to Qingxi and Baixia.</p>
<h3>A Study of a Giant Fish by Xiu Jun</h3>
<p>Regarding the giant fish in Hukou, it was mentioned in this newspaper on March 27 that a dead fish was found in the old lake area of Sheyang Lake, east of Funing, near the sea. It was shaped like a horse, more than ten feet tall, and weighed about three hundred piculs. It had no eyes. The nearby residents and fishermen were all surprised when they saw it. They competed to cut it up to fill their hunger for several days. The rest was sold to the towns and cities, and the proceeds were very large. In the past, people said that fish were the largest among aquatic creatures. I didn't believe it at first. Now that the fish in Hukou is so huge, I suddenly realized that what the ancients said was not false. In the midst of rising rice prices, this giant fish filled people's hunger for several days. It was not a bad thing to provide food for the poor. I have consulted ancient books, and there are quite a few similar giant fish. I have compiled and preserved them to aid in conversation. I have recorded them below.</p>
<p>The "Book of Han, Treatise on the Five Elements" says: In the third year of Jianping, a large fish appeared in Pingdu, Donglai. It was eight feet long and eleven feet tall. Seven of them died. The "Book of Later Han, Treatise on the Five Elements" says: In the second year of Xiping, two large fish appeared in the sea of Donglai. They were eight or nine zhang long and more than two zhang tall. The "Book of Wei" says: There is a Shuntian Temple on the ridge. In front of it is a fish bone with a hole in the middle through which a horse can ride in and out. "Miscellaneous Records" says: Li Deyu had a giant fish rib that was twenty-five feet long. It was engraved with the words: "Sent from the sea in the second year of Huichang." According to the "Hui Tong Zhi," in the second year of Kaicheng, there was a large fish that was six zhang long. It entered the Huai River from the sea and reached Haozhou. "Song Shi, Treatise on the Five Elements" says: In December of the first year of Zhidao, a large fish in Guangzhou struck the seawater and came out. The fish died. It was six zhang three chi long and more than one zhang tall. "Secret Chamber Idle Talk" says: Li Chongju saw a large fish on a sandy island in the sea. When he cut open its belly, he found a boat and three dead people. Their clothes were still complete. "Yu Jian" says: Shen Zuo Zhe once passed by the sea to Putuo Mountain. He saw flags and banners like tens of thousands of cavalry marching east from dozens of miles away in the sea. When he asked the locals, they said: "This is a large fish. The flags and banners are its scales." "Idle Talk of Farmers" says: During the Zhang family's reign, a sea fish fell in a town in Shanghai. It was nearly two zhang long and was called Kuoba. The "Fujian Tong Zhi" says: In the late Hongzhi period, a giant fish entered Jiudu, Zhangpu. When the tide receded, it could not leave. The villagers competed to cut its meat. At that time, they relied on it to survive the famine. The "Jiangnan Tong Zhi" says: In the twenty-sixth year of Jiajing, a large fish was caught at the mouth of Huapu, Suzhou. It had a horse's head and feet and weighed two thousand catties. The "Guangxi Tong Zhi" says: On July 23rd of the thirty-fifth year of Jiajing, a giant fish more than ten zhang long appeared and disappeared on the water surface in Taiping Prefecture. It lasted for three days. The carp's whiskers were all connected to its tail. Those who saw it were strange. The "Jiangnan Tong Zhi" says: In the spring of the twelfth year of Chongzhen, there were two large fish in Songjiang. They were dozens of zhang long, and their eyes could hold three people. They had no pupils. "Miscellaneous Records of Lenglu" says: The Dongyue Temple in Taizhou city has a fish bone orange. It is one chi wide and more than ten zhang long. It is medium flat. The two ends are curved and shaped like an orange. The temple keeper said that it was the tail bone of the fish. Its spine was even larger and was in a certain temple by the sea.</p>
<p>In summary, the dead fish found in Hukou is not yet considered huge. Its shape is like a horse, similar to the large fish at Huapu Port in Suzhou during the Jiajing period. Its height is more than ten zhang, similar to the large fish in Pingdu, Donglai. It has no eyes, similar to the two large fish in Songjiang during the Chongzhen period. The residents cut it up to fill their hunger, similar to the villagers of Jiudu, Zhangpu, during the Hongzhi period. It can be compared and mutually verified.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Scraps - Light</h3>
<p>When striking a match in the wind, it is often blown out. When it is lit, put it in the matchbox immediately, and there is no need to worry about it being blown out.</p>
<p>When walking on quiet roads such as Daxilu, it is best to be careful to prevent cars from speeding by and not being able to avoid them in time. Looking at car accidents, they often happen more often in quiet places than in busy places. This is clear evidence.</p>
<p>In terms of walking stability, rickshaws are not as good as cars, and cars are not as good as trams. The four words "cheap, comfortable, and beautiful" can be applied to trams without shame.</p>
<p>When you encounter a beggar following you on the road, you can cross to the opposite side of the road. The beggar will definitely retreat dejectedly, because each has its own territory.</p>

<h3>Travelogue of Nanyang (3) - Spiritual Flower</h3>
<p>On the fourth day, I had a good dream. I dreamed that the moon emitted light, illuminating my heart. I wrote a poem in my dream. In my dream, I saw the bright moon, its flowing light illuminating my heart. The moon emitted a strange glow, truly the Goddess of Mercy. Auspicious light shone on my head, entering deep into my heart and spleen. I understood the riddle of the mother and child, proving it to this day. Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand, the earth transforms into gold. On the fifth day, I visited the New World, which was similar to Shanghai, but on a much smaller scale. There were also movies and Chinese opera, and many tourists. The price was one or two corners. There was a merry-go-round, which was very interesting. A circular machine moved, and the people in the seats straddled the wooden horses and moved up and down. The shape was not fixed to a horse, or in a fish or shrimp. The movement was random. I said, "This is also the six paths of reincarnation, where gods and humans live apart. But cause and effect are certain, and the body follows the cycle and is not free." Shanghai and Japan both have this game.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, I gave a lecture at Yangzheng Middle School, titled "The True Value of Greater Chinese Culture and Its Mission in the 20th Century." It was roughly based on the history of Eastern and Western cultures, proving that Western national culture does not have the ability to dominate the world, but Eastern national culture does. The mission of unifying the world into a great community in the 20th century lies especially with the Chinese. This article is of great importance, so I have recorded it below.</p>
<p>The British Confucian scholar Darwin said that humans evolved from apes. This is a long time ago, at least 100,000 years ago. We won't talk about that. Let's just say that 10,000 years ago, Europeans only knew how to use stones. Later, they learned to use bones. For example, the bone flute was created in a time that can be recorded. The Africa of Egypt can be traced back to 5400 BC. There are pyramids to examine. But my Fu Xi dynasty was already in 2953 BC. And in 1000 BC, the West, although it had no history, already knew how to use iron, which they learned from the East. The so-called East refers to the area of Asia Minor. In the 12th and 13th centuries AD, Westerners began to know about coal and called it burning stones. The history of Greece can be recorded back to the 7th century BC. The 6th century BC was the era when Sakyamuni Buddha and Lao Tzu were born. The golden age of Greece was in the 4th century BC. Solon 6362丨558 was a sage and legislator of Greece. He studied abroad with monks in Africa and Egypt. The monks taught him, "You Greeks are the younger generation and have no place to speak." Even the Western alphabet Abphabeto was passed from Egyptian Phoenician merchants to Greece. In 466 BC, the Greek sage Felix brought about the golden age of Greece. His achievements can be compared to the Duke of Zhou in China. However, he received a great deal of Eastern academic culture. Many scholars went from a place called Ionia in the southwest corner of Asia Minor to Greece. The Ionian school of philosophy was originally in a place called Miletus in Asia Minor. Therefore, it is also called the Miletus school. Famous philosophers include Thaleso (640-500 BC), Anaximenes (910-542 BC), and Anaxagoras (approximately 550-246 BC). Several of his disciples explained that the elements of the universe are composed of water, that the universe comes from the Infinite, and that it is transformed from one energy. They went to Greece to spread the Tao and were the creators of the first phase of Greek philosophy. The last one was a friend of the Duke of Zhou of Greece, Felix. Not only did male philosophers go to Greece to be pioneers, but even female philosophers went from the East. For example, the highest confidential female advisor to the Duke of Zhou of Greece was the female sage Aspasia. She was not only Felix's confidante, but their relationship was even deeper than that of Felix's wife. She was also from Asia Minor. This Miss Ya was not only Felix's advisor, but also a friend of the three Greek sages Socrates and Plato. She once advised Felix to change from autocracy to a republic. She can be considered the only female sage in ancient and modern times. She was also an Asian who went to educate Europeans. This is the old source of Eastern and Western culture in the first era of Greece.</p>
<p>The description of not having pupils corresponds. The residents cut it up to fill their hunger, similar to the villagers of Jiudu, Zhangpu, during the Hongzhi period. They can be cross-referenced and mutually verified.</p>
<h3>Interesting Stories of Mailmen by Lü Bing</h3>
<p>There was a certain mailman in England who was naturally a heavy sleeper. He had to report to work at four o'clock every night, but he often missed the time. He was repeatedly warned but did not change his ways. Therefore, his superiors warned him that if he did not change his habits, he would be dismissed. The mailman's family specially prepared two alarm clocks, which rang on time. However, the loud sound was not enough to drive away the sleeping demon. Sometimes, the mailman even slept without taking off his boots, so that he could save himself the trouble of putting them on in a hurry. Unexpectedly, after a year, this mailman was suddenly able to report to work on time as scheduled, almost becoming a model for the entire staff. According to his own account, he would set the alarm clock every night. The other end of the clock controlled the opening and closing of a spring. When the bell rang, the movement of the hammer would cause the water tank near his head to open freely, and cold water would pour on his neck. He woke up unexpectedly. This method actually worked. The joy of the mailman can be imagined.</p>
<p>Later, the mailman got married. He had someone next to him in bed, but she did not necessarily have the same habit of heavy sleeping. Therefore, he earnestly instructed his wife to wake him up on time. However, he still did not think it was completely reliable, so he continued to follow the old method and use the water tank. Unexpectedly, when it rang on time, cold water flowed straight down. The wife, who was lying beside him, was greatly affected. As a result, she was ashamed to go to work at the bureau, because her face already showed the claw marks of his wife.</p>
<p>The above facts are enough for interesting talk, so I recorded them in Jackson's new book, entitled "History of Mailman Aviation," because it is full of humor, so I translated it to tell the readers of "Free Talk."</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (1) (8) (1) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 10: The Burning Flames Soar to the Sky, Goulan Praises the Filial Son, Red Carpet Laid on the Ground, Meeting Famous Actors on the Spot</p>
<p>At this time, Zuo Shichen thought, "Liu Xingshu's family is not very wealthy. With a poor family style, and an engagement ring that costs four or five hundred yuan, it seems that five thousand yuan is not enough. But being too shabby is not good. It's really like what Xingshu said, the Fang family has married off several daughters, and there is a comparison. Even if it can't be the best in comparison, it can't be the worst. Like tax officials, there is also a comparison, and it can't be too far off." At that time, Liu Xingshu felt a little financially strained, but he was very happy. Zuo Shichen was his good friend and could talk about anything, but he couldn't dampen his spirits. He was originally a pessimistic person, but now he was happy because of his marriage, which was rare. He said that he had no savings and was afraid of having to borrow money, but his father was in the same circle, and several of their relatives were also in the financial world, so it would be easy to move around, and he didn't need to worry too much. It's just that he would have to bear a heavier burden in the future. While Liu Xingshu's marriage was in progress, his brother Liu Yinmen also returned from Europe and was about to get married. The Chinese used to have an old custom that if there were several brothers in a family, it seemed most appropriate to get married in order. Otherwise, relatives and friends would have suspicions. The same was true for sisters' marriages. Therefore, there was a saying, "If the older sister doesn't marry, it delays the younger sister." It seems that if the older sister is not married, it is not appropriate to arrange a marriage for the younger sister. Nowadays, this is not strictly observed. In the past, order was very important. After Yinbo returned, someone made a match for him. It was also a coincidence that this marriage was also related to the Fang family. That young lady was Fang's nephew, and the cousin of Xingshu's fiancée. It turned out that when Liu Yinbo was studying in Europe, the minister to Belgium was Fang Erxiansheng. He wanted to find a young man with talent and intelligence among the students, and Liu Yinbo happened to be related to the Fang family and knew that Liu Yinbo was not yet married, so naturally he was chosen. Before returning to China, although he had this intention, he did not talk about it, because the group of students studying abroad naturally had a higher vision than ordinary young people. They often had ideal figures, with certain conditions. Moreover, they had breathed foreign air, and perhaps they already had someone in their hearts. Although there were very few female students studying abroad at that time, there were also some who were unable to find qualified women in China, and even some who married foreign wives. It was not unheard of. Therefore, Minister Fang, although he had this intention, did not say it, because he wanted to wait until Liu Yinbo returned to China before speaking.</p>

<h3>Money Market Slightly More Buoyant</h3>
<p>Market Overview: At present, the demand for foreign currency is high, but the reserves are abundant, so the market is not very tight. Until recently, the repatriation of funds from various ports has been gradually returning, so there is nothing to worry about in the market. It is expected that there will be no wild fluctuations from now on. As for the trend of silver interbank rates, during the settlement period of large long-term loans, according to the situation in previous years, there will inevitably be some activity. Even if there is no major rise, the interbank rate of one or two cents will definitely not fall again. However, this year is indeed not as tight as before, so it only felt slightly higher yesterday after no significant ups and downs.</p>
<p>Interbank Rates: (Foreign Currency) The opening price was 7 cents, 2 fen, 2 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and half a si. The closing price was 2 li and 2 hao and a half. The situation was no different from the previous day. (Silver Interbank) The transfer price at the opening was slightly higher, calculated at 9 fen. The closing price was lower again, at 7 fen. The difference between the opening and closing was 2 fen. However, the commission plus water was slightly stronger than last week due to the bank's receipt of funds. Yesterday, the market price of 1 cent, 2 fen, and 3 li was opened, which was a rare situation in several weeks.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market: The opening and closing prices of Jiangnan small dollars were unchanged because there were no transactions, and the price was the same as the previous day, at 6 cents, 2 fen, and 9 li and a half. The opening price of Guangdong small dollars was 6 cents, 0 fen, 0 li, 3 hao, and 7 hu and a half. The closing price was 6 cents. The overall situation was still slightly soft. In terms of transactions, 155,000 jiao were made in the morning and 95,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins returned to Changsan at 3,000 wen, which was 390,000,500 wen.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars: (Silver Currency) Yesterday was Monday, and the inflow and outflow of banks were more frequent. It is estimated that Chinese merchants received more than 3 million in ticket payments, and foreign merchants also received more than 3 million. Telegraphic transfers amounted to more than 500,000, advances amounted to 1.2 million, special receipts amounted to more than 800,000, and various freight, tax, and miscellaneous receipts amounted to more than 10 million. Inflow into warehouses amounted to 1.4 million. Japanese banks received more than 4 million in various payments and outflows from warehouses amounted to 700,000. Silver houses and public houses received more than 29 million in payments, commission payments amounted to more than 4.8 million, and remittances from various sources amounted to more than 1.2 million. Cash payments amounted to 7-800,000. (Foreign Currency) The opening price of exchange tickets was 1.29 million, and the closing price was 970,000. In the note market, the opening price was 131,000 and the closing price was 89,000. The opening price of cash was 155,000 and the closing price was 115,000. The opening price of new currency was 65,000 and the closing price was 40,000. In bank transactions, the interbank market was 650,000 in the morning and 500,000 in the afternoon. In bank foreign currency accounts, the inflow and outflow amounted to more than 1.4 million. The recall and issuance of banknotes amounted to more than 2 million. Foreign currency houses and public houses received more than 4.5 million in payments, commission payments amounted to more than 2 million, and the inflow and outflow of interbank foreign currency amounted to more than 1.6 million. Small foreign currency houses had an inflow and outflow of 7-800,000 in banknotes, exchange rates, new currency, and cash. The total amount of funds returned from various sources amounted to more than 700,000. The export of tea funds amounted to 1.2-1.3 million, cocoon funds amounted to more than 2 million, and miscellaneous grain and wheat funds amounted to 800,000.</p>
<h3>Domestic Interest on Deposits Opened</h3>
<p>Agreed at Five Taels</p>
<p>Whenever long-term loans are due, the silver houses and banks hold a meeting to discuss the interest rates on deposits, generally based on the overall market situation to determine the level. This year, the money market is more relaxed than in previous years, so the interest rate on domestic deposits must be lowered. It was agreed at five taels the day before yesterday, which is 2.5 cents less than the previous period (the end of last year). Those who have relationships with depositors and need to add 5 cents or 1 tael are still allowed, so the maximum is no more than six taels. It is found that the amount of long-term deposits absorbed by money houses this time is far less than the amount of the previous period, because the large number of deposits from customers have been replaced with new accounts. According to the investigation, in addition to the self-use funds left for other business operations, most of them are deposited in Chinese banks. Whether the interest rate is increased depends on the quality of the account and the size of the funds. It is also heard that yesterday, Ningbo houses released more than 3 million in long-term loans due at the end of the month, and the houses in this street also made 4-5 million. It is estimated that the total amount made in the past few days is more than 10 million.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>A Rising Sign Lurks in Mediocrity</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was quite mediocre. The price only increased by a few cents in the morning and evening. However, a rising sign lurks. The foreign exchange rate is firm, and speculators have slightly entered and exited. However, the trading in the market is not frequent, mostly by a few. Since the market opened slightly higher in the morning, the silver price had fallen below the 500 tael mark the day before, but after that, the supply was greater than the demand. The exchange rate seemed loose, falling from 501 taels, 3-4 cents to 500 taels, 0.04 cents. Shortly after, it only fluctuated by a few cents. The Bank of England quoted 11 pence 1875 for May gold and 1 tael 05 fen 125 for Japanese gold. Later, the trading of various houses became more fragmented, but the supply exceeded the demand and once broke the 500 tael mark. However, it quickly escaped the mark, and the exchange rate was still stable. In fact, the people's hearts were not stable.</p>
<p>Opening Exceeded 500 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and there were no major telegraphic transfers. However, the telegrams of the day before yesterday (26th) were unchanged. The silver market shrank by one-eighth, and the June gold was 8 cents higher, at 500 taels 0.03 cents. The gross price rose from 2 cents to 1 tael and 4 cents, but the buying side did not slacken. Later, Mitsui sold a recent Japanese gold at 1 tael 05 fen 25, and Huayin sold an English gold at 11 pence 1875, so the price was lowered to 0.09 cents when the announcement was made. The posted price did not change and was increased by 2-3 cents. Internally, it was flat. In June, US gold was traded between Hefeng and Holland at 11 pence 25. Later, the same industry traded at 11 pence 25. Jia Mali and Sumitomo, Dongya, and others traded June Citibank at 47 yuan 125. At 10:30, it was 0.04 cents. After that, it was mediocre and unchanging. At about 11 o'clock, there were slightly more buyers, raising the price by 3-4 cents. Shortly after, it had been to 0.07-0.08 cents. After 11:30, it fell by 2-3 cents. The market closed at 5 cents at noon.</p>
<p>1 Tael Higher Than the Weekend</p>
<p>The market opened at 500 taels 0.04 cents in the afternoon. Afterwards, it only fluctuated by 1-2 cents. Although the Indian exchange rate had been reported to be 4-5 ounces lower, it did not move. By the second half of the day, the number of short positions sold in the market was the majority. Jia Mali sold July Citibank at 47 yuan 3125, so it was reduced by 5-6 cents. At 2:45, it broke through the mark, at 499 taels 8 cents. Before long, there were scattered strips and the buying side was active. Moreover, Hefeng and Huayi traded May English gold at 11 pence 1875. The people's hearts seemed to be upward, so it was pulled up by 7-8 cents. The market was able to support itself. At 4 o'clock, it was 6 cents. At 4:30, the market closed at 500 taels 0.05 cents, which was 1 tael higher than the weekend (25th).</p>
<p>Making a Small Profit of 11 Taels</p>
<p>The highest price for the whole day was 501 taels and 4 cents, and the lowest price was 499 taels and 8 cents, a difference of 1 tael and 6 cents. The opening price was still calculated at 511 taels and 8 cents because the Japanese gold was unchanged. The margin was about 11 taels. The opening price of goods in May was 500 taels and 3 cents, the closing price at noon was 4 cents, 1 cent in the afternoon, and 4 cents at the close.</p>
<p>Dalian Group's Balance of Inflow and Outflow</p>
<p>Among the buying and selling firms, Yuchengyong, Kunhe, Hengxing, and Yu Da all bought slightly. Wanxingshunli and Zhifengyong sold more. Yuandamaoyong, Yuantai, Dadecheng, Yichang, Yuankangxiang, and Tianxiang had uneven inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Yu Da, Wanxing, Shunli, and retail investors all bought in. Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, Yongde, Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, and Zhikang generally had more outflows and fewer inflows. Hedging was the inflow. The Dalian group had a balance of inflow and outflow, with a total of about 11-1200 transactions. The Guangdong group slightly chased the gains. Speculators watched from the sidelines.</p>
<h3>London, New York, and Tokyo Exchange Markets are Tight</h3>
<p>Not Much Inflow and Outflow... The Market Could Not Develop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC street price for foreign exchange, except for Hong Kong, which increased by 0.25 to 80 taels and 2.5 cents, had no other changes. Major silver exchanges had no market because it was the beginning of the week. However, the telegrams of the day before yesterday were unchanged. The Indian exchange rate increased by 16 ounces, calculated at 57 rupees 2.5. Yesterday, the exchange rates in Yokohama and Kobe were unchanged. However, the domestic exchange rates for London, New York, and Tokyo seemed tight. The market was good early in the morning, then slightly weaker, and then firm again in the afternoon. Compared to last Saturday, the spot price for US dollars decreased by 0.0625 and the Japanese exchange rate increased slightly by 0.125. The gold price rebounded and exceeded the 500 tael mark again. However, Chinese speculators and the same industry had no interest. There were only a few inflows and outflows. About 2-30,000 pounds of English gold were slightly settled. HSBC and Shanghai sold it, and Zhenjin absorbed 1-20,000 pounds. Various banks traded 4-50,000 pounds with each other. About 100,000 yuan of US dollars were traded against each other. Chinese merchants sold 100,000 yuan, and Zhejiang Industrial absorbed it. In the afternoon, Huidah bought in tens of thousands of yuan, which was sold by Maihang. The inflow and outflow of Japanese exchange was only several hundred thousand yuan. Only Mitsui bought and sold. In the afternoon, Fuchang and other gold houses sold several hundred thousand yuan of forward contracts, and Mitsui still had a purchase desire, generally hedging the gold price. As for the market, it could not develop and was temporarily fixed.</p>
<h3>Great British and American Silver Unchanged at 125</h3>
<p>The previous day, telegrams from London and New York indicated that the prices of Great British and American silver showed no fluctuation. The spot price remained at 19 6875 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling 11 25 pence in British gold), and the forward price was still 19 5625 pence. There were small-scale transactions on the ground, and the market was stable. A telegram from New York reported that the price of American silver had dropped by 125, to 4.25 American cents. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling fell by 125, to $4.8625. The rate of the U.S. dollar against British gold also decreased by 09375, to $4.8621875.

<h3>Customs Consolidation Six Shows Greatest Increase</h3>
<p>Trading Suspended Today for April Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, new trading for the June term commenced on the Shanghai stock market. Except for the Seven-Year Continued 2.5 Financial Bonds, all others opened. The morning market was quiet. In the afternoon, prices increased, and transactions were particularly active. The morning opening saw slight fluctuations. Although the secondary market rose, the momentum was moderate. However, when the afternoon market opened, buying interest in Customs Consolidation and Zheng stocks suddenly surged. The May term of the Zheng Liu contract reached a high of over 75 yuan, and Customs also exceeded 66 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan compared to the previous week. Other stocks also rose in unison. Buying interest weakened and prices eased at the close, but ultimately Customs Consolidation Six and Customs bonds still rose by 1 yuan 3 jiao, while other stocks were slightly firmer. The total value of spot transactions for the day was 7,650,000 yuan. Furthermore, the stock exchange will be closed today for settlement.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Trends Are Advancing</h3>
<p>The Stalemate Is Unlikely to Continue</p>
<p>The yarn market is firm and rising. Due to rumors of labor strikes, people are uneasy, and new offerings in the market are not moving easily. Scattered buyers are slightly covering their short positions, while actual sales are also becoming more active. Sichuan merchants' intentions to import remain strong. Although sellers, due to the unstable situation, still have ample inventory, they have no intention of changing course, and the situation has tightened further.</p>
<p>Manbiao Rises by Eight Qian. In the morning opening of the Manbiao market, rumors of labor strikes were rife, and sellers were scarce. Scattered buyers covered their short positions, and prices for each month rose by two, four, and six qian. In the afternoon, actual sales were robust, and market sentiment remained tight. Near-term prices rose by two qian, while distant prices were flat. The total trading volume for the day was 11,350 bales. The closing prices for Manbiao are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Manzhong Closing, Change, Inventory Account Number, Closing, Change, Inventory Account Number</p>
<p>May 1537, Up 8, 39300, August 1540, Up 3, 20600</p>
<p>June 1539, Up 8, 31450, September 1540, Up 4, 2050</p>
<p>July 1539, Up 4, 25200</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales to Sichuan Merchants Are Strong. Sales of spot cotton are active. Sichuan merchants are importing in large quantities. According to statistics, all merchants purchased a total of 1,785 bales for the day, with fellow merchants importing 1,100 bales and Sichuan merchants importing 1,500 bales of forward yarn and 585 bales of spot yarn. Additionally, Guangzhou merchants imported 110 bales, Qingdao 155 bales, Jiangxi 105 bales, Tianjin 205 bales, inland areas 325 bales, Niuzhuang 40 bales, Shantou 115 bales, Changsha 50 bales, and miscellaneous merchants 85 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Looks More Promising</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants Are Also Taking Long Positions in Distant Months</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firm. Foreign cotton is flat and weak, but it has not been significantly affected. This is mainly because the underlying inventory is relatively weak, and transportation is obstructed, resulting in scarce supplies. Han merchants are firmly committed to taking long positions, and Japanese merchants are also taking long positions in distant months. Therefore, it is difficult for the market to fall sharply in the short term. However, factory demand remains sluggish and shows no signs of improvement.</p>
<p>Hanbiao Is Up by One Qian Five Fen. The morning opening of the Hanbiao market was flat. Later, due to a shortage of sellers, the market tightened slightly, and prices for each month rose by one qian. The situation remained firm in the afternoon, and prices rose by another five fen. The total trading volume for the day was 11,500 dan. The closing prices for Hanbiao are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Hanbiao Closing, Change, Inventory Account Number</p>
<p>May 3550, Up 1, 589000, July 3530, Down 1, 563300</p>
<p>June 3535, Up 1, 573800, August 3530, Up 1, 54500</p>
<p>Factory Demand Lacks Development. The spot cotton business remains flat. The source of supplies includes 500 bales of Dongtai cotton, 900 bales of Tongzhou cotton, and 400 bales of Yao cotton. The sales records for the day are on the left:</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton, 37615, Yufeng Factory imported 201 pieces of spot goods for factory delivery, and 37.25, Dakang Factory imported 662 pieces.</p>

<h3>Indian Cotton Sluggish Last Week</h3>
<p>Last week, due to a slight drop in American cotton, brokers sold off, and market prices were weak. Foreign demand for piece goods was sluggish. European manufacturers showed greater interest in raw cotton, but orders from China and Japan were limited. Piece goods demand is expected to improve due to the boycott of foreign goods. Factory cloth is currently active and is expected to continue to improve. Local manufacturers are actively purchasing raw cotton. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week, Last Week</p>
<p>Accumulated receipts since September 1, 2798, 2882</p>
<p>Weekend inventory, 1273, 1295</p>
<p>Accumulated exports since September 1, 1736, 1780</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe, 578, 603</p>
<p>Shipped to China, 276, 277</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan, 840, 856</p>
<p>Other regions, 42, 44</p>
<h3>Grain Prices: River Rice Market in Irreversible Decline</h3>
<p>Overall Market Remains Dull and Soft</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the arrival of goods at various wharves was slightly improved, but the accumulated stock in the river was still substantial. Sales in Shanghai were sluggish, as stores were already well-stocked and observing the market. Additionally, competition from foreign rice put pressure on the market. As a result, transactions for white japonica rice were exceptionally quiet. Prices fluctuated due to a lack of high-quality goods and the abundance of inferior goods. Yesterday afternoon, there were few buyers for medium-quality japonica rice in Zhongguan, and the overall market softened further. Top-quality japonica rice was still in demand, while thin paddy rice was firm for high-quality goods and weak for inferior goods. Although the quantity of goods was not large, the market was strange and dull. Glutinous rice and Xian rice transactions were weak. In recent times, the Xian rice market has been virtually nonexistent, but prices have been quite firm. Alcohol distilleries were the only slight purchasers of substandard glutinous rice, and prices initially fell before stabilizing.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: Approximately ten boats arrived from the river. Changzhou and Wuxi japonica rice from the north of the street were still active, and prices were stable. Su and Tong japonica rice sales were sluggish, and the market was quite poor. High-quality goods were unchanged, while medium and inferior goods softened slightly, with an estimated fluctuation of half a jiao. A small number of merchants inquired about early thin paddy rice from Nanbang, and bids were extremely tight. Top-quality goods were sold as soon as they arrived, while inferior goods inevitably suffered price cuts. Glutinous and pointed rice from the south are currently in very short supply, and transactions are quiet. Sales of white glutinous rice were very sluggish. Although a portion was inquired about in the street, the owners refused due to the excessive discounts. Market prices were nominally flat but actually weak, with buyers and sellers excluding each other.</p>
<h3>Delivery Approaching, Near-Term Noodles Weaken Further</h3>
<p>Distant Months Buck the Trend Due to Weather</p>
<p>Yesterday's noodle market saw near-term months weaken while distant months remained stable in both the morning and afternoon. December, nearing delivery, saw no movement in actual sales. Although major manufacturers did not have short positions, there were still many chips from manufacturers with short positions. At a time when sales were not improving, it was difficult for bulls to cope with the pressure from a small number of actual sellers. Therefore, floating longs closed out positions at any time, while shorts also took the opportunity to cover. However, the trend inevitably weakened slightly. Distant months were initially flat and weak, but in the afternoon, with light rain again due to weather, speculative and long-oriented buyers became active again, and each contract saw a slight rebound. However, small and medium-sized manufacturers were still offering positions for May and June, because they expected the outcome of the current month to be similar to that of the previous month. Therefore, the future trend of near-term weakness and distant stability seems to be already visible. As a result, the closing price for the current month was down another two and a half li compared to the previous week, May was up two and a half li, June and July were up seven and a half li, and August and September were up five li.</p>
<h3>Spot Wheat Demand Weak, Prices Fall by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Light Rain Boosts Futures Market Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw each month open flat and then firm up. In the morning, with cloudy weather but no rain, quotations for foreign wheat fluctuated by one or two jiao, so sentiment was still stable. However, when the afternoon opened, light rain began to fall again, and speculative sentiment revived. Inland areas such as the Xibang were very firm due to the intermittent rain, so a sharp drop in the market still seemed unlikely. As a result, June rebounded three fen compared to the previous week, and July, August, and September each rose two fen. Over 5,000 bags of spot wheat were traded, but bids were down five fen from the previous weekend, because manufacturers were reporting poor noodle sales and weak demand for wheat, resulting in a market where prices were gradually falling and supply greatly exceeded demand. Five liang of wheat from Xuzhou, Qingjiangpu, Suzhou, and Bengbu were purchased by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Experience Sharp Drop of 30-40 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign silk market experienced a sharp drop because overseas inventories were large and sales decreased, and the Yokohama raw silk market was weak. Shanghai's new cocoon raw silk was still rarely offered. Although aged cocoon silk was being offered, European firms suppressed prices and hoarded it. Yesterday, Qianli and others imported 40 bales of Shanghai white factory raw silk, and prices fell by 30-40 taels. Zhonghe imported 20 bales of white dried raw silk, and prices also tended to weaken.</p>
<h3>Early Silkworms in Western Zhejiang Will Soon Be Thriving</h3>
<p>Expect Opening Around the Beginning of Next Month... Unfavorable Weather Makes a Bountiful Harvest Difficult to Expect. In the Jinan, Lanxi, Yuhang and other districts of western Zhejiang, the spring silkworm breeding quantity of farmers this year is not weak. At the beginning of the silkworm season, conditions were still good. After the third sleep, silkworm farmers felt difficulties in breeding due to the impact of unfavorable weather. Many silkworms were found to be diseased and abandoned. Now, early silkworms will be sleeping and thriving, and we only hope that the weather will turn sunny and warm immediately, and that they can be put on the cluster in four or five days at the latest. Silkworm houses in each district have scheduled separate openings on the fifth day of the next month. Whether the harvest will be bountiful or poor depends on the weather. This week is the most important time for the silkworm season, and silkworm farmers are full of worries.</p>
<h3>New Local Green Tea Is on the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yuancheng Yong Tea Shop displayed 37 boxes of new local Zhenmei tea samples. The rough tea was purchased from Hangzhou and produced by Yitongxing Tea Shop. The fragrance and manufacturing method are excellent. After English firms reviewed them, it was heard that Jardine had already sent telegrams. Although British firms had counter-offered, the difference was too great and no transaction was made. Observing the situation from all sides, the opening is still some time away.</p>
<h3>Recent Tea News from Tunxi and Wuyuan</h3>
<p>Tea Houses in Tunxi Are Mostly Observing the Issue of Opening</p>
<p>Wuyuan Expects Pessimistic Views Due to High Costs</p>
<p>Tunxi is the central location of Huixiu and Shexian tea markets. There are no less than 70 tea houses in this town and in Shuikou, Liyang, Yanghu, and other places. This year, most of the old tea houses, except for a portion that has prepared to open, are mostly observing. The reason for this is that there is no guarantee that foreign sales will be smooth. Although sales to Russia have recovered, the prices offered are extremely low, barely covering transportation, tax, and decoration costs. Chinese merchants are losing no less than 40 taels per dan. Additionally, tea houses are tightening the release of remittances, and money is tight inland, so mountain prices cannot be suppressed. In view of these difficulties, tea houses have not been as enthusiastic as in previous years. Recently, Tunxi has had plenty of cash, and ticket prices have fallen back to 1,380 yuan compared to the beginning of the month. Whether tea houses in Tunxi will increase depends on the rise and fall of ships in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wuyuan's green tea is of high quality, and mountain costs are generally higher than elsewhere. This year, due to soaring rice prices and doubled commodity prices, it takes 30 workers to pick and bake each dan of tea, costing 27 yuan in wages, 7 yuan for meals, 10 yuan for firewood, and 5 yuan for miscellaneous items. The usual cost of cultivation is 10 yuan, totaling about 60 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan per dan compared to the past. At first, each tea house still hoped that mountain prices would decrease. Based on the cost of these mountain households, each dan would have to be 80 yuan or more when it opens in the future. Therefore, tea houses, seeing these mountain prices, are even more pessimistic about the future due to the heavy cost of making finished boxes.</p>
<h3>British Tea Merchants Restricting Production</h3>
<p>Since 1925, the production of tea in India and Java has increased sharply from 20 million dan to 40 million dan. Although the London market has a large appetite, supply greatly exceeds demand. With ample inventory, tea prices have fallen sharply, and tea merchants are in a precarious situation. Now, British tea merchants have unanimously agreed to strictly limit production from this year onwards in order to maintain the tea industry.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Hangzhou Merchants Search for Fine Cloth Spot</h3>
<p>Local Factory Cloth Prices Rose Again Yesterday. This was because the goods needed to cover silver at the end of the month had mostly been sold off, and Hangzhou merchants were again searching for fine cloth spot in a big way. Yesterday was the last day, so over 200 pieces were transported, bought and loaded on the spot, and prices rose by 2.5 to 5 fen. Ningbo merchants imported over 100 pieces of 11-pound coarse cloth, and prices also firmed up. However, there was still no improvement in the situation for the Yangtze merchants. The Jiangxi and Anqing ports with the greatest demand were lacking enthusiasm. Yesterday, Guangzhou merchants imported 150 pieces of fine diagonal cloth, priced at 6 liang 9 qian 2.5 fen. Northern merchants were experiencing sluggish imports due to the unsettled situation.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods Trends Are Disordered. Eastern goods are affected by the Zhongyuan factory strike, and some goods are particularly scarce, such as Changbanqiao Zhigong Ni, Baokiu, Bald Blue Gray, and Jiji. These goods will not arrive until the strike is resolved. Moganshan Zhigong Ni also rose by 2.5 li, opening yesterday at 2 qian 7 fen. Printed cloth is increasingly falling due to sluggish Indian sales, resulting in a flood of shipments to China. Yesterday, dark-colored Chongshen was only selling for 3 liang 9 qian 5 fen, and white-ground cloth was 3 liang 9 qian, with little sales. Actual sales to Sichuan and Han merchants were still dull. Ningbo merchants added slightly to their purchases. Over 20 pieces of Western glass yarn were imported yesterday. Maolong Four Heroes were 2 qian 4 fen, and Huaji Jubaopen were 2 qian 3.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Blue and Red Sugar Scarce and Popular</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sugar Market Quiet and Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market telegraphs from production areas indicated that Cuban spot sugar and New York futures sugar showed no rise or fall. The price of Javanese spot sugar was 10 guilders, and the price of May futures sugar was 10.125, both down by 125. June saw no rise. There was still little buying interest in Shenggonghui sand white sugar, and the market appeared weak, with a transaction price of 7 liang 2 qian. High-quality goods reached 2 qian 5 fen. The market was slow. Japanese sugar N brand was 7 liang 7 qian, YP brand was 7 liang qian 5 fen, and YRO brand was 7 liang 3 qian. Transactions were not many, and the market was stable. Only over 100 bags of Mianhu red sugar were sold, priced at 7 liang 6 qian. Inventory was scarce, and the market was still popular. Yellow Gang Blue sugar was still lacking on the market, and even inferior inventory was thin. Therefore, Banan Blue continued to be sold off for days, and prices remained as before. The market gradually became more lively.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: A box of gold bars was transported from Hankou to Shanghai, worth 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>1,249 pieces of Indian ramie and 25 pieces of ramie bags were imported yesterday.</p>
<p>6,100 barrels of cement and 700 pieces of Western paper were shipped from the United States to Shanghai.</p>
<p>82 boxes of dried scallops were shipped from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>580 boxes of matches were shipped from Japan to Shanghai.</p>
<p>1,500 pieces of American cotton and 15,018 pieces of Indian cotton have arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>880 bags of wheat were shipped from Shashi to Shanghai.</p>
<p>New Qingchuan fish was offered by Shanghai Commercial Bank yesterday for three weeks of forward delivery of 4,000 boxes at a price of 5 liang 4 qian.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Kobe, agar-agar is scarce and the market is tight, and various shops continue to raise prices by 10 yuan.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Chen Dezheng delivered the opening address, saying: "Central Government representative, esteemed guests, comrades, today the Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee members of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality are taking their oaths of office here. These Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee members were produced from the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality. During the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress, meticulous and complete instructions were given regarding party affairs, politics, and other work. From these thorough resolutions, the Executive and Supervisory Committee members taking office have a clear path to strive towards. On this day of taking the oath, I would like to provide a comprehensive and concise report on our work over the past year to the Central Government representative, esteemed guests, and comrades. The environment of the past year had too great an impact on us. The work of the Municipal Party Headquarters was mostly in responding to events, with the actual work often wanting to be attended to but circumstances not allowing it. After the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress, we have well-organized steps and plans in advance to ensure that all matters will be completely realized under predetermined plans. In terms of party affairs, there are four main objectives: organization, propaganda, training, and mass training. All four aspects received thorough instructions at the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress. In terms of organization, we are proceeding step by step according to the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress. Within a year, we can make the party organization in Shanghai comprehensive and successful. Not only will the district branches and party departments be comprehensive, but every comrade will be able to be a vanguard of the party. Comrades, under a comprehensive organization like a net, will operate flexibly, acting as the arm is controlled by the body and the finger is controlled by the arm. In terms of propaganda, the impact of the past environment was too great. Temporary events often occurred, leaving us overwhelmed, so that the work of the party could not be fully implemented according to the initial plan, going to the people and delving into the masses. Now we must not only expand propaganda but also delve into the people, so that everyone believes in the ideology and obeys the will of the party. This is certainly what we should strive for, but it is also a point we hope everyone will often instruct us on. In terms of training, little training work was done in the early stages. Only in the past year has training work been highlighted. Now we want to enable every party member to accept the party's orders and obey the party's will. In terms of education, the education sector must earnestly implement in accordance with the party's ideology. We have plans to ensure that party member training and party ideology education will both have considerable achievements within a year. As for mass training, we know that this work is the most difficult to do in Shanghai, because Shanghai has a large population, a mix of Chinese and foreigners, and complex elements. However, while difficulty cannot be avoided, difficulty is also our best opportunity from the party's perspective. We must use the party's will to overcome difficulties. In the past, there were many strange and bizarre events. In the future, we must not only make the mass organizations comprehensive but also make the masses obey the party's orders and accept the party's will to implement them. We originally intended to strive along this path, and we especially hope that everyone can jointly assist us. Today, there is much more to say about the party, but for the sake of time, I can only mention the important points here. Regarding politics, it is also okay to say a little more. In an era of saving the country through the party, governing the country through the party, and building the country through the party, the party's responsibility for politics is greater than in any other time or country. The party has the responsibility to supervise and examine politics. In the past, the Shanghai political authorities were able to present all their work to the public, even making the public satisfied, because of the efforts of the authorities and the success of party-government unity. On the government's side, it was believed that political work was the work of the party. On the party's side, it was believed that the work of the party was to support the work of the government. Therefore, there are many events that Shanghai has achieved that other places have not. I dare to believe that if this continues, the government will naturally recognize that political work is the work of the party, and the party will naturally recognize that the work of the party is to support the work of the government. Then, the six years of political tutelage will certainly be completed earlier than in any other place. This is the success of overcoming all complex forces with the strength of party-government unity. Therefore, in the future, as long as we strive according to the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress, the future success will certainly be greater than in the past. In addition, there are many other things that the Sixth Congress entrusted to us. We hope that everyone will help us to fully realize them. What we hope from the Central Government representative, esteemed guests, and comrades is, first, that all comrades will supervise us at all times, so that those who are taking office here today will never forget the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress. What we ask of all comrades is that the strength of these Executive and Supervisory Committee members taking office is limited, and we must have the concerted assistance of all comrades and the entire citizenry so that no difficulties arise in the execution of the resolutions. This is the first point. Secondly, Shanghai has a large population and complex circumstances. If you say that Shanghai has many nests of reactionary forces and many obstacles to our work, we hope that everyone will remove a difficulty on the negative side, which is to help the Municipal Party Headquarters complete a task on the positive side. This is the second point. Thirdly, everyone's energy is used to deal with the reactionaries. Therefore, at this time, we especially hope that everyone will pay attention to the activity of the reactionaries and rise up to expose them, so that the work of the party can proceed smoothly and everyone's energy can be concentrated on construction work. This is the third point. There is also one more point: in the past, there were often situations where comrades could not understand each other. This kind of mutual suspicion invisibly reduces the strength of the revolution. We believe that only with the strength of the revolution can the city's culture and politics develop, and only with the strength of the revolution can the people live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, we hope that everyone will no longer engage in meaningless attacks and slanders, and that they will jointly assist this Executive and Supervisory Committee in implementing the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress. In short, the Executive and Supervisory Committee has only twenty or so members, and their strength is limited. However, it is also very easy to make their strength great, which requires the assistance of all comrades. If everyone can assist the Executive and Supervisory Committee with all their heart, their strength will be great; otherwise, not much strength can be found. The above few shallow words are what I, on behalf of all the Executive and Supervisory Committee members, sincerely tell everyone, and they are also the few points I hope for from everyone. Finished."</p>
<p>Representative's Address: Central Representative Cai Yuanpei's instructional address roughly stated: "Today is the inauguration ceremony of all of you committee members, and Yuanpei has been ordered by the Central Government to oversee it. The position of the Shanghai Party Headquarters is unmatched in importance except for the capital. Shanghai is a very complex place. Before the revolutionary army reached the Yangtze River basin, Shanghai already had many comrades undertaking very important work. After the revolutionary army arrived, they still did not slacken. All of you committee members have been very diligent in the past. Chairman Chen's report on the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress is already known to the Central Government. The Central Government is very satisfied with such preparation for a year's work. In the circumstances of Shanghai, the most important thing is the training of the masses. We must train every member of the masses to have the qualifications of a party member. The Central Government has discovered the mistakes in Guangdong and Wuhan in the past and is actively striving to work practically, such as the regulations for afforestation, literacy, and other movements, which will be carried out separately by the provincial and municipal party headquarters to the county party headquarters and district branches. Also, during the period of political tutelage, it is necessary to train the masses in the exercise of the four powers, so that in the future, the period of constitutional government can be reached. However, in activities such as afforestation and literacy, it is imperative to make the masses aware of the consequences of not having forests, such as future disasters, and the relationship between forests and water conservancy. Everything must be thoroughly understood by them. The reason why they do not understand is that they do not know our propaganda. For example, training the masses to exercise the four powers solely by relying on spoken language will have limited effectiveness, and many legal provisions cannot be translated into spoken language. Sun Yat-sen also saw this in the early days of the party, so he wanted to teach the people to read. The literacy movement is the most important work to start during the period of political tutelage. The phonetic symbols recently passed by the Education Conference and decided by the Central Government are the best tool for literacy, because it is very difficult to promote literacy only using the current characters. Even in the case of the Thousand Character Classic, there are still very few who can read newspapers and books after finishing the Thousand Character Classic. Phonetic symbols are a method invented by Mr. Wu Jingheng. First, teach them to use local pronunciations to annotate the sounds, and it will be easy to read. After the masses can recognize phonetic symbols, the work during the period of political tutelage will be easier to carry out. First, promote it from the district branches to nearby households, and gradually promote it to the entire citizenry. It is very convenient. Today, there is nothing to guide the committee members in Shanghai. I have especially presented the new phonetic symbols decided by the Central Government to everyone, hoping that in addition to implementing the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress, everyone will pay attention to this literacy tool."</p>
<p>Guest Speeches: (Mayor Zhang Yuejun's speech) roughly stated: "Esteemed guests, brothers, I am a member of this party, and today, the committee members of this city are taking office here, and I should express some meaning. At the same time, in my capacity as the administrative head of this city, I will say a few words. The work of the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee has always been very diligent. This is recognized by everyone, not only by the comrades but also by the general public. From the secret period to the period after openness, the excellent achievements of its work are unparalleled among party headquarters in various places. Among party headquarters throughout the country, the Shanghai Party Headquarters can truly be taken as a model. From the purge of the party until the re-election last year, in a very adverse environment, all the committee members and comrades have been able to take the words of Sun Yat-sen as their guiding principles and the actions of Sun Yat-sen as their examples, not fearing death and never giving up. I personally feel very admired for this spirit and this spirit of loyal effort. All the comrades present must also have the same feeling of admiration as I do. The chairman just reported that regarding the sixth Shanghai Municipal Party Congress, the direction to strive for in the future in regards to party affairs, how to make the organization of the party more rigorous, how to strengthen the foundations of the party, how to expand the party's propaganda, and how to step up the training of party members and the training of the masses should be fully implemented. This is what all the comrades and the people of the city are very hopeful for. The Chinese Kuomintang is a party that governs the country, builds the country, and saves the country. This was determined in the First National Congress. If this cannot be done, then China simply does not know what state it will be in. To implement governing the country through the party, building the country through the party, and saving the country through the party, the party must stand in a position of supervision and guidance, and unreservedly apply supervision and guidance to the government. The government must also absolutely accept the supervision and guidance of the party, consult with each other, and help each other to achieve the true meaning of governing the country through the party and to complete the work of the period of political tutelage. Since taking office last April, due to environmental reasons, I have been somewhat regretful that the work that should have been done could not be fully realized. The comrades in the city government also have this feeling, and the party headquarters has been able to forgive it. For a year, urging has never stopped, and guidance has been added. The relationship between the party and the government has become increasingly close. We hope that this relationship and this spirit will progress with time and become closer with time, so that the politics of Shanghai Special Municipality will gradually get on the right track, so that the reactionaries will be completely eliminated, and so that the people will have peace and prosperity. All of you committee members, in private, are all good friends, and in public, are all the most loyal comrades of the party. We all have a deep understanding of each other. What we hope from the committee members in the future is to hope that each committee member will make further efforts to fulfill their mission." (Ye Huijun's speech from the Chamber of Commerce Preparatory Committee) roughly stated: "Today, the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters is holding the inauguration ceremony for the Executive and Supervisory Committee members, and our merchants and people are all very welcome. Why should we welcome them? Because in the midst of it all there is a great purpose and a great hope, which is that the people of Shanghai have no way out and are running around in chaos day and night. It is hoped that the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of Shanghai Special Municipality will guide a way out in order to achieve its goal on the right path, so that more than 2 million people in the city will not take the wrong path. I can say that the lives of the people throughout Shanghai are on the bodies of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members taking office. If all the Executive and Supervisory Committee members cannot find the right path for the people, the people of the city will all die. I believe that you will definitely be able to take on this responsibility after taking office, so welcome, and so on."</p>
<p>Committee Member's Response: Pan Gongzhan, representing the Executive and Supervisory Committee members, delivered a response, saying: "Today, the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive and Supervisory Committee members are taking their oaths of office. We are very grateful for the guidance from the Central Government representative, esteemed sirs, and comrades regarding the work we should do in the future. At the same time, we will summarize what everyone has said and use it as a compass for the work of the Executive and Supervisory Committee in the coming year. First, regarding the method specially proposed by Central Government Representative Cai, which is to use phonetic symbols in the literacy movement, we believe that only literacy can open up the people's minds, and the training of the four powers must also begin with the development of the people's minds. At the same time, we believe that it is impossible to develop the people's minds using the existing characters. For example, if you put up a slogan saying 'Those who are illiterate cannot be citizens,' or even 'Those who are illiterate cannot be people,' who are you showing it to? Showing it to those who are literate? They don't need to see it. Showing it to those who are illiterate? They simply can't see it. Therefore, using characters to make people literate is a dream. Only using phonetic symbols can achieve this goal. The Central Government has now decided to use phonetic symbols as a tool for propaganda and education. Mr. Cai has especially raised this point, and we solemnly accept and abide by it. We also have a statement to make, which is that in the past, many party affairs workers regarded work as the work of the party headquarters, rather than the work of the party. For example, today, they receive a few official documents and send a few official documents, regardless of the actual efficiency for the people. For example, the literacy movement is the work of the party and is one of the seven movements stipulated by the Central Government. If you use the strength of the party headquarters alone, it will not succeed. Among the 2.8 million people in Shanghai, there are no fewer than hundreds of thousands who are illiterate. Relying solely on the strength of the party headquarters personnel to teach them to read will certainly not be enough. You must first have all the party members in the city fully understand phonetic symbols, and then use all the party members in the city to teach the masses they are close to, and then rely on this part of the masses who have already become literate to lead the rest of the people who are not yet literate to become literate in order to succeed. This is just using literacy as an example. All work should be done in the same way. For example, the tree planting movement, if only representatives plant a few trees every year, that's how it will be in ten years or a hundred years, and Shanghai will still have those few trees. Therefore, you must specify a time for everyone to make efforts separately, and then there is hope for success. At the same time, we heard Mayor Zhang say that in the past year, the reactionary forces in Shanghai have been very rampant, but there has been no major trouble, which is due to party-government cooperation. Therefore, in the future, the party and the government must be completely like one family. Regarding the people, Mr. Ye said that 2.8 million people are locked in a bamboo garden with no way out, and the Executive and Supervisory Committee members must lead them out. This responsibility is too great, and our strength is too small. However, since we have been elected as Executive and Supervisory Committee members, we should strive to shoulder this responsibility. However, before the concessions in Shanghai are recovered, the environment is complex, and many matters cannot be as easy as we hope. There must be non-swearers among the people who come out, accept the intentions of the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive and Supervisory Committee, and lead other people to find a way out of the bamboo garden. We know that the most difficult thing is the middle way, but it is also the most stable. Headlong rushing is the easiest. Therefore, we can only follow the path of the Central Government, not to the left or to the right, and follow the teachings of Sun Yat-sen. Not only can we lead all the people in Shanghai, but we can also lead the people of the whole country. Now that there is a bright light ahead, we must also light up street lights along the way so that the people can advance on the middle way. Therefore, we not only have party-government cooperation and abide by the intentions of the Central Government to implement the resolutions of the Sixth All-Shanghai Congress, but we also want to make our work and our strength deeply penetrate into the midst of the people, and that is what this means."</p>
<p>Committee Oath: "I swear with utmost sincerity to abide by Sun Yat-sen's will, believe in the party's ideology, obey the party's orders, abide by the party's program and discipline, complete the national revolution, and realize the Three Principles of the People, in order to seek freedom and equality for China. I will never act with self-interest to harm the party or become corrupt. If I violate this oath, I am willing to receive the most severe punishment from the party. I solemnly swear."</p>

In addition to ordering the military police to strictly investigate, this announcement is hereby issued, and all are to comply and not violate it. Sincerely command.

<h3>French Concession Cracks Down on Reactionary Propaganda Organization</h3>
<p>Located in Bao'an Lane, Xujiahui Road</p>
<p>The General Organization for Reactionary Propaganda</p>
<p>Leaflets Available in Both Chinese and Western Languages</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Mr. Fevrier, Commissioner of Police of the French Concession, suddenly received a secret report stating that the house at No. 27 Bao'an Lane, Xujiahui Road, was the general headquarters for reactionary propaganda in all of Shanghai. All the printed materials and reactionary leaflets found in Shanghai recently were completely issued from that location. He was requested to investigate quickly. After receiving the report, Mr. Fevrier secretly ordered Political Director Salie to lead Western detectives Sumiano, Mamuya, and Chinese Inspector Cheng Ziqing, Detective Wang Yongkui, Detectives Zhu Liangbi, Fan Guangzhen, Luo Hezhou, Cui Jingyun, Zhou Rongzhang, Wei Yuansheng, and all the detectives of the Political Department, to go to the address by car at approximately 3 PM to search. They seized two large printing presses and various reactionary printed materials on the spot, with content in both Chinese and Western languages. At the same time, five people were arrested and taken to the police station by car for investigation. According to those who know the details, the propaganda organization of the reactionaries has suffered a major blow, and it will be difficult to recover.</p>
<h3>New Foreign Affairs Vice Minister Wang Jiazhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Arrive in Nanjing Tomorrow</p>
<p>The newly appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Jiazhen, accompanied by his personal secretary, Guo Yimin, arrived in Shanghai from Dalian yesterday afternoon at 4 PM aboard the Fengtian Maru. After resting briefly in Shanghai, he is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing tomorrow. The details of his arrival and his remarks are described below:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: Those who went to the pier to welcome him yesterday included Zhou Jue, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Wang Yanxi, Second Secretary of the Embassy in Italy; representatives from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Gong Debei, Councilor of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; Cen Dezhang, Secretary of the Municipal Government; and Song Ziliang, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Last night, they also visited Wang's residence, the East Asia Hotel.</p>
<p>Arriving in Nanjing Tomorrow: After disembarking, Wang and his entourage immediately took a car to the East Asia Hotel to rest. This reporter made a special visit. Wang was physically robust and very modest in his conversation. According to him, he will rest in Shanghai for one day and arrive in Nanjing on the 30th. When asked about the Russian situation, he replied that what he had heard recently was still going smoothly. If our country wants to recover the China Eastern Railway before the deadline, the cost would be too great. It would be better to negotiate a shortening of the deadline. If negotiations with Russia can be based on the treaty in every aspect, the Russians will naturally have no excuse.</p>
<p>Resting in Liaoning: When asked when Hu Ruoyu would go south to take office as the Minister of Internal Affairs, he said that Hu had been suffering from meningitis in Tianjin and had improved slightly after surgery. He is now recuperating in Liaoning, and there is no definite date for his trip south. He also said that Wu Tiecheng is also in Liaoning. Because he has been running around in various places for many years, he is also willing to take the opportunity to rest temporarily. Therefore, he firmly declined the position of Minister of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>Wang's Brief Biography: Wang Jiazhen, courtesy name Shuren, is from Shuangcheng, Jilin. In the 13th year of the Republic, he graduated from Keio University in Japan. He immediately served at the Chinese Embassy in Japan for one year. He then went to Hankou. Before long, he became a section chief in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. He is currently the Director of the Diplomatic Secretariat of the Northeast Border Defense Commander's Office.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting returned to Nanjing by express train at 12:30 PM yesterday afternoon. He told this reporter on the train that he had not yet met with U.S. Ambassador Johnson in Shanghai. Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to go to Nanjing with Italian Ambassador Hualei tonight (last night) to discuss various diplomatic matters. Rumors that Britain and Japan are secretly coordinating and adopting delaying tactics regarding the French rights issue are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Record of the Movements of Prominent Figures</h3>
<p>Minister of Railways Sun Ke, Minister of Agriculture and Mining Yi Peiji, and Superintendent of Jianghai Customs Liu Jiwen all took the night train to Beijing last night.</p>

<h3>Prince Takamatsu, Younger Brother of the Japanese Emperor, Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<p>This Morning, He Participates in the Celebration at the Consulate</p>
<p>Prince Takamatsu Nobuhito, the third prince of Emperor Taisho of Japan, was ordered to Europe to reciprocate a visit to the British Emperor. He traveled from Japan with his princess on the Kashima Maru postal ship the day before yesterday. While passing through Shanghai, he stayed for two days at the request of Japanese officials and gentry in Shanghai. At 6:00 AM yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai. More than 150 Japanese officials and gentry residing in Shanghai, including Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi, greeted him at the pier. Foreign Minister Wang also sent Director Chen Shiguang to represent the government at the pier to welcome him. However, because the Japanese prince had previously visited Shanghai last year and toured the Shanghai scenery, he decided not to land and tour this time, and declined public and private banquets in order to rest quietly on the ship. Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu had prepared a temporary residence at his private residence on Seymour Road, but the Japanese prince also declined. Today is the Japanese Emperor's birthday, Tencho-setsu. The Japanese prince will land with his princess to attend the remote worship ceremony at the Japanese Consulate. After the ceremony, he will return to the ship to rest. Attached below is a brief biography of the Japanese prince and his entourage:</p>

<h3>Public Buses Have No Hope of Resuming Service in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Negotiations Between the Two Sides Have Stalled</p>
<p>The strike of public bus workers in the Public Concession has lasted for ten days. Negotiations between the strike representatives and the company regarding the conditions for resuming work are still stalled. According to Mr. Peng Na, a clerk of the company, the crux of the stalemate is that the workers are demanding that wages be paid as usual during the strike period, which the company cannot accept. As a result, the negotiations have reached a deadlock. There is no certainty as to when the workers will resume work. However, the company is currently training Russians and hopes to resume the first public bus route soon. The first route was originally from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, but it has now been temporarily shortened to Jing'an Temple to Waibaidu Bridge.</p>
<p>According to the Da Wan Bao, this morning (28th), news from the police indicates that public buses in the Public Concession are unlikely to resume service within the current week. This is because company officials fear that if service resumes before May 1st, the vehicles will be attacked. Therefore, they have decided to wait until the end of the week to observe the situation before announcing the resumption date. The Russians who have been hired are still undergoing training, and they are scheduled to go to the Public Works Department's Transportation Bureau today and tomorrow to take the examination for a license.</p>
<h3>No Results from Negotiations in the Public Concession Tram Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>News from the Union: The Public Tram Strike Committee sent three representatives to negotiate with the management yesterday. After the three representatives met with the company's manager, the manager not only completely rejected the workers' conditions, but also said that the workers' representatives were too young and not qualified, and that the number of people was too small to be considered representatives. In addition, he led one of the three representatives into the room and said, "You three are not qualified to be representatives. I will now designate the following numbers as representatives. You can go find them to negotiate." He then wrote down several numbers and left the room. The representatives believed that the management was not sincere in negotiating and left in disappointment. After the Strike Committee received the report from the three representatives, it felt that it was unheard of for the management to designate negotiation representatives and believed that the management was deliberately undermining worker solidarity and plotting to sabotage the strike. It was greatly angered and immediately issued an emergency flyer to all workers, announcing that the management was using divisive tactics to sabotage the strike conspiracy, and called on all workers to adhere to strike discipline, absolutely obey the orders of the Strike Committee, and act in unison. All workers were very angry when they heard the news and decided that if any individual acted alone without the order of the Strike Committee, they would be considered a scab and a traitor and would be dealt with severely according to strike discipline.</p>
<p>News from the Company: Yesterday, three representatives from the workers went to the Tram Company on Suzhou Road to negotiate the conditions, but there were no results. Mr. Bao Qishi, the general manager of the Tram Company, told reporters yesterday, "Recently, three representatives came to the company to negotiate the conditions, but these three were not tram workers, and I do not recognize their qualifications as representatives, so negotiations did not begin. However, the company is very willing to be close to the workers. If the workers send formal representatives, I am very willing to negotiate with them sincerely. It is expected that tomorrow (that is, today), the workers will have formal representatives to come here to discuss."</p>
<h3>German Industrial Delegation Travels to Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>The German industrial delegation led by Mr. Paoziman and others have been in Shanghai for several days. Due to the large number of social engagements, they took the 9:00 AM express train to Hangzhou yesterday morning for sightseeing. The Zhejiang Provincial Government sent a special representative to receive them. The delegation will stay in Hangzhou for about one or two days before returning to Shanghai and taking a ship to Tianjin by sea.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In response to the situation in China, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy has increased the strength of its Yangtze River naval forces. It has specially dispatched a small team of naval soldiers from Sasebo, including Oda, Kimura, and Tanaka Shinichi, to China. They arrived in Shanghai by ship yesterday. They did not stay in Shanghai but immediately transferred to Nanjing to serve on the Beijing-based warship Saga, ready to land to protect Japanese nationals if necessary.</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau Dredges Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Since taking office, Song Ziliang, the director of the Dredging Bureau, has been working hard to rectify the bureau's affairs. Recognizing that the silting of the lower reaches of Suzhou Creek (from Waibaidu Bridge to Yejidun) is closely related to the Huangpu River, he proposed a dredging plan at the bureau's meeting. Later, because the creek is under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, he obtained the consent of Mayor Zhang and was determined to proceed. He specially invited other bureau directors and representatives from the Municipal Government, as well as Port Director Xi Dingmo, to board a small boat and survey the creek section by section, according to the map, in order to start construction. The previous report that he requested financial assistance from the Public Works Department and invited Public Works Department Director Kangding to inspect the area together is not true; there is no such person. It is also heard that the Construction Committee is now proposing a dredging plan, which is likely related to the entire creek project and will be implemented.</p>

<h3>Special District Court Heavily Guarded, More Than One Hundred Youths Escorted to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau</h3>
<p>Among the 107 people, there were seven women. Only Tang Xicheng was bailed out by the Japanese Cotton Mill.</p>
<p>Details of the Disturbance the Previous Morning: At 10:00 AM the previous morning, several hundred youths suddenly gathered near the Dongxin Bridge on Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession. Although they were dispersed by detectives, at 10:45 AM, the crowd poured into Renji Shantang at 566 Yunnan Road, intending to hold a meeting. Later, the police authorities urgently dispatched Chinese and Western constables from the reserve team of the Gordon Road Police Station, together with the Tongban detectives from the Laozha Police Station, to surround Renji Shantang. They then entered the building to stop the meeting and arrested as many as 107 men and women at the scene. The rest scattered. At the time, the order at the scene was somewhat chaotic, but fortunately the authorities coordinated well and order was quickly restored.</p>
<p>Seven Young Women: Among the 107 people arrested, there were seven young women. According to the names they provided at the police station, they were Wang Chunhua, Chen Fengzhen, Zhao Min, Lin Shuzhi, Jiang Tao, Jiang Bo, and Lin Xiuying.</p>

<p>No Such Large Detention Center: At the time, a large number of various reactionary banners were seized and taken to the Laozha Police Station. The police chief ordered the seven women to be transferred to the women's prison of the Special District Local Court for detention. The one hundred men were divided between the General Patrol Station and the Xinzha Patrol Station to avoid overcrowding because the police station did not have such a large detention center.</p>
<p>The Court is Heavily Guarded: At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Du Fuyao of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court specially opened the First Criminal Court for a preliminary hearing. When they were escorted from the police station to the court, armed Chinese and Western constables were dispatched to protect them along the way. After arriving at the court, the armed constables were stationed at the entrance of the court, and the security was very strict.</p>
<p>The Interrogation Took a Long Time: Judge Du took his seat, and all 107 people were brought into the courtroom. Observing their ages, they were all in their early twenties and were students and workers. Judge Du then questioned them one by one, asking their age, hometown, address, etc. By noon, only half of them had been questioned, so he temporarily adjourned the court for lunch and a brief rest, and then resumed his seat at about 2:00 PM to continue the proceedings and question them one by one. Only Wang Ren and Li Xiaosi changed their names. Wang claimed that his real name was Zhao Tailai, and Li claimed that his original name was Su Hanping.</p>
<p>Transfer by the Municipal Public Safety Bureau: Subsequently, a detective from the Municipal Public Safety Bureau presented a document requesting permission to transfer them to the Municipal Public Safety Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Many Iron Bars and Lime: Bogliang Rubao Yi, the lawyer of the police station, also stated the circumstances of the case, saying that the defendants suddenly went to Renji Shantang on Yunnan Road yesterday morning, hoping to hold a meeting. The hall usually provides diagnosis and medication. Although it was a Sunday yesterday and there were no consultations, the door was not closed, so they were able to enter. When the police received the report, they dispatched detectives. Upon entering the building, they first discovered many iron bars and lime bags. These two items were prepared by them, perhaps to injure others.</p>
<p>The Police Received a Tip-off in Advance: In addition, many leaflets were seized, all of which contained counter-revolutionary content. The police station received a report from the Public Safety Bureau in advance, so they stepped up their precautions. After investigating, it was found that none of the people arrested were residents of the concession. The Public Safety Bureau requested a transfer, and the police station did not object.</p>
<p>Tang Xicheng May Be Exempt from Prosecution: However, Tang Xicheng, one of the people arrested, is an employee of a Japanese cotton mill. Yesterday, the factory sent people to inquire about the news and was arrested along with the others. Now the Japanese employer has arrived at the court, and after he proves his identity, the police station can withdraw the charges against Tang.</p>
<p>The Western Constable Reported Everything: Constable No. 169 also reported the situation at the time, saying, "At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, I was patrolling outside in a car and saw many male and female students walking in groups along Dongxin Bridge. At 10:40 AM, extending to Yunnan Road, I saw a large number of students wanting to go to Renji Hall to hold a meeting. I immediately went to investigate and saw that the courtyard inside the building was already crowded with people. Some people were holding flags, others were distributing leaflets, and one person was giving a speech. When they saw me, one of the students threw a bag of lime at me. I immediately arrested him. There was also a basket full of glass bottles in the room."</p>
<p>Statement of Head Constable Feng: According to the report of Chinese head constable Feng Ruisheng, he first saw male and female students gathering at Dongxin Bridge and dispersed them, but they soon reunited. Later, he suddenly lost sight of them, and later learned that they had gone to Renji Hall to hold a meeting. He also rushed there and saw two red flags hanging outside the gate of the hall, so he returned to the police station and summoned detectives to stop them.</p>
<p>Tang Xicheng is Granted Release: Finally, Mr. Ganggan, a Japanese national from the Nei Wai Cotton Mill, proved that Tang Xicheng was sent by the factory to gather information and was not a reactionary. Judge Du concluded the preliminary hearing and announced that Tang Xicheng was granted bail.</p>
<p>The Men and Women Were Transferred Together: The remaining 106 men and women were allowed to be taken back by the officials from the Municipal Public Safety Bureau for interrogation. At that time, the temporary police inside and outside the court also withdrew.</p>
<h3>Thugs at the Intersection of Caishi Road Reiterate the May 30th Massacre</h3>
<p>Claiming to be Bringing Glory to the Country</p>
<p>Because the Gu Zhenghong Case Was Handled</p>
<p>There Was No Riotous Behavior This Time</p>
<p>Fifteen People Were Tried and Awaiting Further Interrogation</p>
<p>On the 16th of last month, hundreds of young men and women gathered at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangti Road in the French Concession, shouting slogans against imperialism, holding flags, and throwing stones at trolleybuses. When the police learned of this, they immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene to disperse them. They arrested Chu Zhixiang, Liu Jizhao, Song Zhongjie, Xie Yunju, Guo Deming, Lü Juefan, Li Yushu, Bao Susheng, Li Guangyuan, Luo Zhong, Li Yuebai, Huang Shoutian, Dong Bixong, Han Weiyi, and the woman Zhou Wenjun, and seized a red cloth flag with the Western code "CP" written on it, as well as dozens of stones. They were all taken to the police station and, after being interrogated in the French Court, the defendants denied everything and were ordered to await further investigation. Yesterday, they were interrogated again. First, Western Detective Sarge stated that the statements made by the defendants in the court last time were not true. Now, the police station has found that the defendants have no fixed addresses, which shows that they are troublemakers. Please investigate. When asked, Chu Zhixiang confessed that he had been detained and tried in court in the Public Concession during the May 30th Massacre because he represented the workers who were massacred in the Gu Zhenghong incident. This was bringing glory to the country and was a legitimate matter. Although they had passed through the area this time, they had not engaged in any riotous behavior and were indeed mistakenly arrested. The rest of the defendants gave similar answers. Chinese and Western officials ordered them to be remanded in custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Two More People Accused of Counter-Revolutionary Crimes</h3>
<p>Border Cannons Hidden in Kerosene Tanks</p>
<p>Each Also Carried Reactionary Leaflets</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, police stations in the Public Concession stepped up precautions in their respective jurisdictions and were particularly strict with inspections. Therefore, in addition to arresting a large number of men and women at Renji Shantang, there were two other cases of arrests along the way. One was at 9:15 AM when Bao Tan Liu Chunshu and Huang Fusen of the Laozha Police Station were searching near the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beihai Road. They saw a Jiangxi man named Li Jincai carrying a kerosene tank. They searched it and found many border cannons. He had a bundle of reactionary leaflets hidden on his person. There was also a piece of white paper listing the names of five people, so they arrested him and seized two small red and white flags in the alley. The other was near Gordon Road and Roberts Road. At the same time, Bao Tan Kong Qingping of the Putuo Road Police Station and Chinese and Japanese constables were searching pedestrians when they saw a Zhejiang man named Hu Xiangmu coming from the front, holding a paper box. They opened the box and inspected it, and it was full of reactionary leaflets, so they took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were both sent to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Both were prosecuted for counter-revolutionary acts. Judge Du Fuyao specially opened the First Criminal Court for a preliminary hearing. First, court lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated the facts of the case, saying that border cannons were certainly fired by these people at the beginning of their actions as a signal. After Judge Du briefly questioned the two defendants about their age and origin, he ordered them to be taken into custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>People Distributing Reactionary Leaflets Also Found in Pudong</h3>
<p>One Ma Desheng</p>
<p>Two Elementary School Students</p>
<p>Ma Desheng, from Wuhu, was walking near the Shenyuli of the Taoyuanzhai Garden Stone Bridge in Pudong at about 9:00 PM the night before last when many reactionary leaflets were suddenly found on the ground. The patrol police of the Third District Public Safety Bureau believed that Ma was walking in a hurry and was not a good person, so they stepped forward to arrest him and take him to the district. Yesterday, after the district chief interrogated Ma, Ma confessed that he was 42 years old and lived at No. 12 Yanchang Road, Pudong.</p>
<p>He worked as a dock coolie at Yilongmao Pier and had previously served as a platoon leader in the Huangpu Training Corps. He followed Commander-in-Chief Jiang from Shaoguan and went through Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Later, he asked for a long leave due to illness and came to Shanghai, resulting in unemployment, so he became a coolie. He did not distribute reactionary leaflets. The authorities believed that Ma's confession was not credible and ordered a written order to escort him to the Public Safety Bureau for disposition.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a child named Wang Linhe, 11 years old, was found carrying 40 reactionary leaflets while walking near Sanwanchang, Lujiazui, Pudong. He was discovered by the post police of the Fourth Squadron and the child and the leaflets were sent to the Third District. After Wang was interrogated, he stated that the leaflets were brought by Zhang Gengsheng, an elementary school student from the Chen School next door, and told him to take them to his uncle's house, which led to their discovery. Then Zhang Gengsheng was summoned and confessed that he was 14 years old, a local, and lived behind the Wu family. The leaflets were given to him by someone wearing a gray cloth long gown and asked him to distribute them. He then handed them to Wang Linhe and did not know that they were reactionary propaganda items. It was ordered that the two children Wang and Zhang, along with the leaflets, be sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Bizarre Case: Instigating Husband's Murder and Surrendering</h3>
<p>Husband and Wife Had Been Very Affectionate</p>
<p>Vehemently Denying Conspiracy to Murder Her Husband</p>
<p>The Informant Speaks with Certainty</p>
<p>Waiting for Shen Honggao to be Summoned for Further Inquiry</p>
<p>Ni, the wife of Shen Hongchuan from Tongzhou, along with Zhang Yuqing and Xu Qingyun, were apprehended yesterday by the Mixed Court police and brought before the Shanghai Special District Local Court, accused of conspiring to murder Shen Hongchuan. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. According to the police lawyer, yesterday afternoon (the 27th), Chen Yulin reported to the Mixed Court police that on April 6th, Zhang Yuqing and Xu Qingyun, residing at No. 1425 North Shanxi Road, went together to a small teahouse near the Tangjia Lane vegetable market. They told him that Shen Ni was asking him to murder her husband Shen Hongchuan because he was excessively extravagant and addicted to opium. They arranged to meet again in seven days at a teahouse near the Old Zha Gate Bridge to discuss the matter further. At the appointed time, he met with the woman and Zhang and Xu at the agreed-upon location. Zhang and Xu gave him eight silver dollars, twelve small silver coins, and a colored scarf. Later, he couldn't bring himself to commit such a heinous act, so he informed Shen Hongchuan. However, Shen refused to believe him, so he reported the matter, etc. At the time, Chen handed over the silver dollars and the scarf to the police. Therefore, the police sent detectives to arrest Shen Ni, Zhang, and Xu. Because the informant was a key witness, he was also temporarily detained. Now, her husband, Shen Hongchuan, has been summoned, requesting an inquiry, etc. Shen Hongchuan testified that he is 33 years old and runs a kiln goods shop in Shanghai. Ni is his legal wife, and they have been married for eleven years, with three sons and two daughters. The relationship between husband and wife has always been harmonious, and his wife's character is excellent. There is no way she would have such malicious intentions. Chen Yulin used to be a cohabitant, so they knew each other. A few days ago, Chen suddenly told him that his wife wanted to murder him and urged him to sell his wife quickly. He did not heed his words. Later, Chen borrowed fifteen dollars from him, which he also refused. He then went to the police to fabricate a false accusation, hoping to frame him, requesting a strict investigation, etc. Chen Yulin testified that the reported facts were true, and if there were any falsehoods, he was willing to accept severe punishment, etc. Shen Li, Shen Hongchuan's mother, testified that her son, Hongchuan, and his daughter-in-law, Ni, were usually very harmonious. It can be asserted that Ni would never have any intention of murdering her husband and is actually being framed, etc. Shen Ni, in addition to vehemently denying any conspiracy to murder her husband, also stated that her husband's elder brother, Shen Honggao, previously had a dispute with her husband over inheritance and was involved in a lawsuit in their hometown of Tongzhou. Since then, the brothers have been at odds, and Honggao has always harbored intentions to harm her and her husband. She asked for a clear investigation into the reason, etc. The police lawyer requested that Shen Honggao also be summoned as a key witness in the case to clarify the truth. Judge Wu ordered that the three defendants, Shen Ni, etc., and the witness Chen Yulin, be detained separately and wait for another hearing on a different date.</p>
<h3>Husband in Jail, Wife Having an Affair at Home</h3>
<p>It Can Be Said She Is Heartless</p>
<p>The Father-in-law Gathered People to Catch Them</p>
<p>Chen Xingshan, a 54-year-old farmer from Zhujia Bang, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, has a son named Chen Liugen, who used to be a road worker. He married a woman named Wu in the twelfth year of the Republic [1923]. The son, due to his violent temper, separated from his father and rented a house in Jiande New Village, Song Park Road. His wife, Wu, worked at the Dehe Hosiery Factory in Tanjiabridge, and they were able to make a living. However, Liugen associated with bandits and gathered a crowd to beat someone named Jie from Hubei to death in Tongjia Bang, Pengpu Township, during the autumn. The case was brought to the Suzhou Higher Court, and he was sentenced to seven years in prison. Wu is now 26 years old, in her prime, and not used to sleeping alone. Therefore, she formed an inseparable bond with Wang Wenbing, a fellow worker from Huzhou, and openly had adulterous relations with Wang Wenbing at home, as if they were husband and wife. However, the good times did not last long, and her father-in-law, Chen Xingshan, found out. On the night before last (the 27th) at ten o'clock, he led his neighbors to his daughter-in-law's room in Jiande New Village and caught the adulterer and adulteress naked in bed. They guarded them until dawn and reported to the Zhujia Bang Ninth Team of the Shanghai North District Security Corps nearby. The team sent members to escort the pair of lovebirds to the corps headquarters. According to Wu Chen, her husband is currently in prison, and her daily hosiery weaving wage is only three or four dimes, which is not enough to cover expenses. She started having an affair with Wang Wenbing in February of this year. She spoke candidly, without any shame, and said that Wang Wenbing had been taught by her to stay overnight at home. According to Wang Wenbing, Wu took the initiative to him, and he originally did not dare, but Wu said she had complete control. Now he deeply regrets his mistake. The corps, since the territory belongs to the jurisdiction of the Fifth District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, handed over the plaintiff Chen Xingshan, the defendants Wu Chen and Wang Wenbing to the patrol officer Yan Dasheng of the Bazibridge Branch Station, who dispatched patrolman Liu Henglin to the district for questioning.</p>
<h3>Extortionists Arrange to Collect Money in the Park</h3>
<p>The Extortionist Arrived on a Bicycle</p>
<p>Detectives Swarmed Forward and Arrested Him</p>
<p>Zhu Ligen, a local resident of No. 215 Changsha Road, Xinzha, is the manager of the Zhongzi Silk Mill in Zhabei. He received threatening letters on the 18th and 21st of this month, demanding 25,000 silver dollars and arranging to meet at the Old Garbage Bridge and North Henan Road. Zhu sent the letters to the Xinzha police station. Detectives were dispatched, accompanied by Zhu's representative, Luo Chasan, to the two locations as scheduled, but there was no sign of anyone. On the 24th, Zhu received another extortion letter, changing the arrangement to 9 a.m. on the 25th at the Bund on Nanjing Road. Luo waited for over an hour but still did not encounter anyone. He then took a tram back to Zhu's house. When the tram arrived at the New World stop, and he was walking along Guling Road, a person suddenly asked Luo if he was Zhu's representative. Luo said yes. The person then asked if he had brought the money. Luo immediately told him that Zhu's finances were exhausted, but he could barely raise a few hundred dollars. The person said that at least five hundred dollars was needed and arranged to deliver it at 10 a.m. on the 26th at the China Park on Sichuan Road Bridge. Luo then reported to the police station. Detectives Ruan Yao, Bao Tan Ma Jiayong, etc., rushed to the location the next morning and ambushed near the park. Luo waited at the arranged place. Soon, the extortionist who had made the arrangement with Luo arrived on a bicycle and asked if the money was ready. Luo told him that only two hundred dollars had been prepared. The detectives swarmed out and arrested the extortionist along with his bicycle. Upon questioning, he revealed his name as Zhang Quansheng, from Jiangbei, who works as a rickshaw puller in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Shanghai Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu conducted a preliminary hearing. Luo and Zhu successively explained the situation. The defendant confessed that someone else had initiated the matter and that person had already escaped. He was being fooled, etc. The court ordered the defendant to be detained, and the hearing was adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Apprentice of Cuisheng Fish Shop Absconds with Funds</h3>
<p>Cao Axiao, a 19-year-old apprentice at the Cuisheng Fish Shop in Wusong, is from the Caojiazhai in Taiwan. He is short, has a yellowish complexion, and usually behaves properly and rarely smiles. Therefore, he was assigned to guard the silver box in the accounting room for a safe sleep. However, Cao harbored ulterior motives and committed theft while guarding the treasury. The night before last, in the middle of the night, he used a kitchen knife to pry open the drawer of the ledger and steal the key. He opened the silver box and took all the cash inside, consisting of 691 silver dollars, 365 paper dollars, and small silver coins, totaling over 1,060 dollars. He absconded secretly yesterday morning at dawn. Later, after the shop assistants discovered it, they immediately informed the accountant, Mr. Lu, to check the silver. Only then did they realize that the apprentice had absconded with the funds. They immediately asked the local Seventh District First Police Station for Officer Huang Fenglin to come to the shop for inspection. They also detained the apprentice's father, Cao Fusheng. After questioning, Cao Fusheng confessed that he did not know that his son had stolen the silver dollars and that Axiao had not returned home. Director Zhang suspected that Axiao was short and could not carry so much cash alone, fearing that someone was secretly colluding with him. Therefore, he detained Cao Fusheng, ordering him to hand over his son for questioning and investigation.</p>
<h3>Man Waving Knife Due to Mental Breakdown</h3>
<p>Chen Genfa, a 35-year-old from Liyang, lives near the Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong and used to work as a boatman. However, Chen recently suffered from a mental illness that recurs from time to time. Yesterday morning, his old illness relapsed, and he went out wielding a kitchen knife, randomly threatening passersby. Pedestrians scrambled to avoid him. He then walked to the Lujiazhai area, where he was encountered by a police officer from the Fourth Squad. The officer managed to disarm him and took him to the Third District. After questioning by the district chief, Chen gesticulated wildly and spoke incoherently. His family members were ordered to take him back and keep a close watch on him, preventing him from causing trouble outside.</p>
<h3>Tragic Accident While Repairing Car Chassis</h3>
<p>Wang Along Died Tragically</p>
<p>The No. 9430 car of the China Moving Company on Fuxu Road was damaged. On the evening before last at 7 p.m., Wang Along, a copper worker from the company, was repairing it. Wang was working lying under the car when he touched an internal mechanism. The car suddenly started moving automatically, and Wang could not avoid it, causing the wheels to crush him. Although the company people managed to stop the car, Wang had already suffered severe injuries. Although he was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital, he had already passed away. The Xinzha police station was notified, and detectives were ordered to take the body to the Filan Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Special District Local Court commissioned Prosecutor Cai to inspect the body at the mortuary. After determining the cause of death, he ordered the deceased's aunt, Chen Zheng, to claim the body for burial. The company, pitying his tragic death, agreed to give the family a consolation fee to cover funeral expenses. This is similar to the death of a copper worker from a car company in Xinzha a few weeks ago. However, in the former case, the car was suspended for repair, and the rope broke, causing the car to crush him. In this case, he was lying under the car for repair and was crushed by the wheels. Both can be said to be unexpected disasters.</p>
<h3>Shen Zhaolin Seriously Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Shen Zhaolin, a local resident, 30 years old, has been running the Zhaofeng Lime Shop at No. 5 Ninghe Road, Xiaoqiaotou, Nanshi. Yesterday afternoon, around 1:45 p.m., Shen was riding a bicycle alone on an errand. While passing the west entrance of Penglai Road near South Zhonghua Road, heading north, he accidentally went the wrong way, causing him to be hit by the No. 948 commercial car of the Overseas Chinese Motor Company, No. 1613 North Sichuan Road. Shen fell to the ground and suffered a severe head injury. Police Officer Cui Yuyi, who was stationed at Post No. 25, witnessed the incident and took the driver and the car to the station. After careful questioning by Director Meng, according to Shen, he has a twin brother named Ge Hailin, who is currently an accountant at Hongtai Rice Shop. Director Meng ordered the police to summon Hailin to the station and immediately sent the injured person to Qu Zhifu Hospital for treatment. He immediately prepared a document to submit the driver Zhu Qin to the Local Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Woman Accuses Husband of Neglecting Support</h3>
<p>Defendant Replies That There Is No Relationship</p>
<p>Claims Plaintiff Is Forcing Herself to Be His Wife</p>
<p>Gao Feng, a 41-year-old local woman, accompanied by her son, Gao Xiangsheng, 20 years old, went to the Shanghai Local Court to accuse her husband, Gao Songlin, of abandoning his legal wife and neglecting support, requesting to live together, etc. Her statement stated that when the plaintiff was 21 years old, Gu Ren and Wu A'er served as matchmakers. Gao Songlin was looking for a wife because his previous wife had passed away and he lacked someone to take care of the household. Therefore, the plaintiff married the defendant. For the first few years, they lived peacefully. The following year, she gave birth to a son named Xiangsheng (the second plaintiff), who is now 20 years old. The defendant used to run a southern goods store in Caojiadu. He then discussed with the plaintiff, asking the plaintiff to live separately. The plaintiff initially did not think much of it. In recent years, the defendant has not returned home and has neglected the livelihood of the plaintiff and her son. The plaintiff repeatedly argued with him, and although the defendant admitted his fault, he still did not provide any support. The plaintiff could initially make a living by working, but because of old age and illness, she cannot support herself. The defendant heartlessly abandoned his legal wife, failing as a husband. She requested that the defendant be summoned to court and ordered to live with the plaintiff, etc. The defendant, Gao Songlin, stated that he has no physical relationship with the woman and was surprised by the unfounded lawsuit. He hired lawyer Wei Wenhan to file a response, arguing that the plaintiff was misrepresenting the facts and making false accusations, requesting dismissal. The defendant is 55 years old. He has been able to console himself throughout his life that his legal wife is still alive and well. Relatives and neighbors are all aware of this. His younger brother, Gao Qilin, and Chen Hongshan, a tenant who has lived with him for over 20 years, can all testify. Now, unfortunately, the harmonious couple has been cursed by others, who strongly wish for the defendant's wife to be deceased. The plaintiff and her son are making claims with no basis to force themselves as his wife and son. It is outrageous. The defendant and the plaintiff were only neighbors and had met a few times. Later, the plaintiff moved away. After many years, she ran out of options and tried to borrow money from the defendant, citing their former neighborly relationship. He refused, and she shamelessly tried to force herself as his wife. There is no limit to her madness. The plaintiff and the defendant have no marital relationship. The so-called abandonment and neglect of support are completely irrelevant. He requested that the lawsuit be dismissed, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Du held a court hearing. The plaintiffs, Gao Feng and Gao Xiangsheng, recounted the previous events. The defendant, Gao Songlin, denied that the plaintiff was his wife. The witnesses Gao Lin and Chen Hongshan testified that the defendant still has a legal wife at home. After receiving the testimony, the judge ordered the defendant to bring his legal wife to court for verification at the next hearing. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Feng Feihong Countersues Gong Huifen</h3>
<p>Feng Feihong, the owner of Feng Wenji Glass Shop, opposite the Shanghai Little World, because his concubine Feng Gong (i.e., Gong Huifen) sued him in the Local Court for abandonment, had been summoned, and Feng filed a counterclaim, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Upon investigation, the main point of the counterclaim submitted by Feng's lawyer Li Zuyu stated that Feng had been running Feng Wenji Glass Shop opposite Little World for many years. He married Gong as a concubine through the matchmaker Huang Ruizhi, spending 200 silver dollars. Initially, they lived on the upper floor of the Dafa Electric Light Company on East Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. They had a good relationship and had a daughter. Later, Gong secretly had an affair with someone named Chen, causing the relationship between husband and concubine to deteriorate. Feng, being a reputable businessman, tolerated it for the sake of his reputation. However, Gong was instigated by her younger brother to forge various loan contracts, hoping to extort money from Feng. When that failed, she caused disturbances in the store, and the police took her to the Public Security Bureau. Because Feng was addicted to opium, he was transferred to the court and sentenced to detention. Before Feng's sentence was over, Gong secretly moved a room of redwood furniture worth 400-500 dollars that Feng had purchased and transferred a house (which Feng had funded) to someone else, obtaining 700 dollars, which she kept for herself. She also dared to make false accusations, requesting a thorough investigation, etc. The Civil Court has scheduled a hearing for this case on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Fate of a Young Widow</h3>
<p>Becoming a Young Widow and Coming to Shanghai to Work</p>
<p>Found by Her Father-in-Law, She Painfully Returns Home</p>
<p>Wei Lü, a young woman of 18 years old, from Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, was betrothed to her cousin, Wei Qingjiang, by her mother, Lü Wei, since childhood. They married in November of last year, and the relationship between husband and wife was very close. However, just one month after the marriage, Wei Qingjiang suddenly fell seriously ill and died. Lü, in her prime, suddenly became a widow, feeling very sad. Her in-laws not only did not show any sympathy but blamed her for her son's death, saying that Lü's fate was not good. They often abused her. Lü could not bear it. Before seven weeks, she seized the opportunity to escape back to her mother's house. With the help of a relative named Wang, she came to Shanghai and worked as a female worker at the Yong'an Second Cotton Mill in Wusong Yunzao Bang, residing in the factory's No. 10 workshop. After Lü ran away, her father-in-law, Wei Baosheng (also her maternal uncle), immediately inquired about Lü's whereabouts from his sister, Lü Wei. Lü Wei feigned ignorance. Wei Baosheng then sent people to investigate everywhere. He soon found out that Lü was now in Wusong. He immediately came to Shanghai from his hometown. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., he took a car to Wusong and went to the Yong'an No. 10 workshop, where he found Lü. Lü suddenly saw her father-in-law and took the opportunity to run away, trying to hide. However, she was caught halfway. Lü wailed and cried, firmly unwilling to return to Xinchang with her father-in-law. For a time, onlookers gathered. Officer Shi of the Seventh District First Branch of the Public Security Bureau was patrolling and passed by. After inquiring about the situation, he felt that Wei Lü's fate was pitiful, but living alone in a foreign land was not a long-term solution. He persuaded both Wei Lü and Wei Baosheng. Lü finally agreed to return to her hometown with her father-in-law. Wei Baosheng also agreed to take Lü back to Xinchang and hand her over to his sister, Lü Wei. The father-in-law and daughter-in-law then took the train to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Convenience of Visiting Sheshan</h3>
<p>Special Ship Prepared at Xinzhuang</p>
<p>Sheshan, a scenic spot belonging to Songjiang County, has long been famous. Every spring, visitors flock there. However, in the past, due to inconvenient transportation, travel was quite troublesome. Therefore, those who lived in relatively remote areas were deterred, only longing for it in their hearts. It is heard that the Xinzhuang Tongli Navigation Company, to facilitate those visiting Sheshan, will launch special steamship services starting from May 1st. Visitors can take the 7 a.m. express train from Shanghai to Xinzhuang, then transfer to a steamship directly to Sheshan. At 4 p.m., the ship returns to Xinzhuang to connect with the 8:37 train to Shanghai. The fare is four dimes per person, and the meal fee is two dimes per person. Visitors who wish to stay overnight can stay in the dormitory. The accommodation fee is two dimes per person. The time is approaching for the welcoming of the Holy Mother. With convenient transportation, it is expected that Catholics and visitors from all over will be even more crowded than before.</p>
<h3>A Man and a Woman Suddenly Enter Yihe Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>Accused of Inciting a Strike</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Days Detention</p>
<p>At 6 p.m. on the night before last, as the night shift at the Yihe Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road was starting, Guan Runhong from Changzhou and Xu Xiaomei, a woman from Anhui, suddenly entered the mill and were active there. They were discovered by a Western inspector of the mill, Sikasot, who arrested them and sent them to the Yangshupu police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Shanghai Special District Local Court, accused of trying to incite a strike. Judge Feng Shide conducted a preliminary hearing. According to the inspector, the two were not employees of Yihe and secretly entered the cotton mill to incite workers to strike. When questioned, both defendants denied the charges. According to Guan, he went to the mill to play last night and was arrested because he could not leave and wanted to stay overnight. Xu claimed that she wanted to work in the cotton mill and went to the mill with a female worker last night to observe and learn so that she would not be completely ignorant in the future. After the hearing, Judge Feng sentenced Guan Runhong and Xu Xiaomei to three days of detention each.</p>
<h3>Soldier Crushed to Death by Train</h3>
<p>Returning to His Hometown of Ruian County on Leave</p>
<p>Jumping off the Train in Haste, He Died Tragically</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9 a.m., a third- and fourth-class passenger train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, heading from Shanghai to Wuxi, ran over a soldier near the Gujiazai area near the Zhenru station. The deceased was wearing a gray uniform and was lying face down on the ground to the right of the railway, with his head to the east and his feet to the west. His left foot was crushed. The location was about five or six li north of Gujiazai and east of the station. The road police inspected his identification and found that he was a soldier named Shi Banqing from the Tenth Company of the Replenishment Regiment of the Eleventh Division of the National Revolutionary Army, from Bangbu, who was on leave returning to his hometown of Ruian County, Zhejiang Province. He also had a paper long leave pass, two pay slips, two silver dollars, and two dimes.

<h3>The Truth About the Arrest of Crew Members of the Taisun Ship</h3>
<p>A Major Tragedy of Stevedore Brawls</p>
<p>The Taisun, a vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, recently traveled from Shanghai to Wenzhou. Upon arrival, significant incidents occurred, including the arrest of crew members over alleged rice theft and a fatal brawl among dockworkers. Now that the ship has returned to Shanghai, the full details of these events have been investigated and are recorded below.</p>
<p>Traveler’s Smoking Set Causes Trouble for Crew</p>
<p>Recently, Wenzhou has been strictly enforcing local defense measures, especially with the organization of a joint military-police inspection bureau. All merchant ships arriving at the port are subject to thorough passenger inspections. This time, when the Taisun ship arrived in Wenzhou, before it had even docked, the military-police inspection bureau dispatched twenty soldiers, led by a platoon leader, on small sampans to board the ship from the stern. They spread out to inspect all the cabins. In the steerage compartment (leased to passengers), a complete smoking set was discovered. Four soldiers from the inspection team confiscated the contraband and demanded that the crew hand over the person carrying it. Amidst the commotion, the passenger had already escaped. The crew searched without success, but the soldiers insisted, dragging Second Purser Wang from the Second Purser’s office. While waiting, the ship's accountant, Wang Lanqing, and the steward, Jian Rong, arrived and explained to the soldiers that the passenger smuggling the contraband could not be found. The four soldiers then produced hemp ropes and tied up Wang and Jian, taking them away. At the time, Wang and Jian were only in their underwear and barefoot, not even having time to put on clothes. They were detained at the inspection bureau. Crew members who went to bail them out that night were refused, being told that only the surrender of the actual culprit would secure their release. Therefore, when the Taisun returned to Shanghai yesterday from Wenzhou, Wang and Jian had not yet been released. The matter has now been reported to the bureau's business director for intervention.</p>
<p>Stealing Rice by Warehouse Clerk Leads to Major Conflict</p>
<p>Due to famine in Wenzhou, large quantities of foreign rice were procured in Shanghai for price stabilization. The Taisun also transported this rice to Wenzhou. The crew took the transportation of the rice very seriously, as they would have to compensate for any shortages. Therefore, they were extremely cautious during unloading. Among the rice being unloaded, there was a batch purchased by the Yongli Warehouse. During unloading, the crew discovered that a clerk from the warehouse was stealing rice. He was caught and reported to the dock police, who arrested him. Unexpectedly, this sparked a major conflict. The arrested clerk was forcibly retrieved by people from the rice warehouse. A brawl ensued with the police. Furthermore, the rice warehouse side held a public meeting, denying any theft and claiming that the crew had slandered their reputation. They demanded that the Taisun ship compensate for the losses, with the following conditions: (1) a penalty of thirty tables of wine, (2) two opera performances, and (3) an apology. Eventually, through the mediation of the public association, the Taisun ship was persuaded to settle the matter peacefully by admitting to a fine of two tables of wine and paying for firecrackers. The incident was thus resolved.</p>
<p>Dockworkers Fighting Over Cargo Results in Four Deaths</p>
<p>Dockworkers in Wenzhou are divided into different gangs. Among the stevedores, there are so-called "Seafarers' Gang" and "Firewood Gang." Those working at the China Merchants Bureau dock belong to the Seafarers' Gang. This time, when the Taisun arrived in Wenzhou, workers from various gangs competed to unload the cargo. The Firewood Gang workers and the Seafarers' Gang workers fought over the cargo, leading to a brawl. This matter was unrelated to the ship and not something the shipping bureau should interfere with, so no intervention was made. The two gangs engaged in a major fight on the dock, using poles and other weapons to strike each other. As a result, four workers from the Firewood Gang died from their severe injuries. The local public security bureau has arrested all the workers involved in the violence. This tragic incident has led to significant complications.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Ships to Shanghai Are All Delayed</p>
<p>Since the fatal brawl among the dockworkers, dockworkers have gone on strike, ceasing to load and unload cargo. The China Merchants Bureau has three ships in Wenzhou. Apart from the Guangli, which sailed to Shanghai first, the Taisun's arrival in Shanghai was also delayed due to the temporary work stoppage, which delayed its cargo loading. Furthermore, the Guangji, which was supposed to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, will now be delayed by one day and is scheduled to arrive today.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Society Held Re-elections Yesterday</h3>
<p>Waiting for the National Government to Send Personnel to Supervise the Unsealing</p>
<p>The Third General Meeting of Members of the Chinese Red Cross Society, following the resolution of the General Meeting, organized a preparatory re-election committee. The situation has been reported previously. Yesterday morning, after the memorial week, Chairman Wang Yiting reported on the findings of the preparatory re-election committee, and Committee Member Wang Yiting presented re-election proposals. The proposals were seconded by committee members Huang Hanzhi, Wu Wei, and Guan Gangzhi. Supplementary opinions were offered by Qingpu representative Xu Xichun, Lü County representative Dong Lin, and re-election committee members Gu Keyong and Shen Laisen. Before a vote could be taken, lunch was served. The meeting continued at 2:00 PM, with Wen Lanting attending and announcing his views, which were unanimously endorsed. Voting commenced immediately. The number of delegates present accounted for more than three-quarters of the total registered. As the National Government and the Party Department had not yet sent personnel to supervise, it was decided to seal the ballot boxes on the spot. The ballot counters Wang Peiyuan, Zhou Guoxun, Dong Lin, and Zhou Guangji handed them over to the chairman, Wang Yiting, for safekeeping, pending the arrival of National Government personnel to supervise the unsealing, to ensure utmost caution.</p>
<h3>The Silk Cocoon Merchants' Association Convened a Meeting of Cocoon Merchants</h3>
<p>The General Association of Silk Cocoon Merchants of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui convened a temporary discussion meeting of silk cocoon merchants at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th). Over ninety people attended, including Shen Moushen, Zhu Jing'an, and Wu Shenbo. Huang Moushen chaired the meeting. After announcing the purpose of the meeting, the first item discussed was the issue of foreign firms not complying with the resolution regarding the weight and quality of silk delivered by the merchants. Several merchants rose to report that since the implementation of standardized public weighing on April 1st, factories have switched to using canvas bags and eliminated oil slips, white paper, and hemp bags. However, foreign firms still demand oil paper and hemp bags, as well as extracting sample silk strands for testing. It was previously resolved that two strands should be drawn from every five bundles, and the foreign firms should issue receipts and return them after weighing. The Export Silk Association had agreed to comply with this resolution. However, apart from firms such as Huatong, Weicheng, Hulin, and Jingxing, the others still extract one strand from each bundle and do not issue receipts or specify the weight of the strands. The Mitsui firm is the worst offender, not only extracting more strands but even refusing to load the silk onto ships unless oil paper and hemp bags are provided, violating the resolution. The merchants felt it was difficult to deliver silk due to these extra demands. It was resolved unanimously to reject the demands and to instruct brokers to firmly refuse them. A letter was also sent to the Export Silk Association, requesting that it immediately inform all foreign firms to cease these extra demands to maintain good relations. The next item discussed was the increase in discounts for cocoon loan insurance premiums. The delegates who attended the Sino-foreign joint meeting, Shen Moushen and Wu Shenbo, reported on the situation at the meeting of the foreign insurance association. It was resolved that the association would convene a general meeting this week and respond after the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Public Works Bureau Establishes the Chenjiadu Ferry Office</h3>
<p>To regulate water transportation, register, and inspect ships, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has established ferry offices at the Puhui Dongjiadu Wharf and the Xinzhapu Bridge on the Wusong River. However, because the Wusong River is narrow, ships are crowded, and those heading for inspection find it difficult, the bureau decided to establish a ferry office and a boat donation branch at Chenjiadu, where sailboats gather and many ships travel to Chenjiadu and then to Caojiadu and Xiaoshadu without going further. Previously, to facilitate ship merchants, the bureau and the Finance Bureau sent personnel to the area for inspections and to collect donations. However, this was not a long-term solution, so the two bureaus consulted and decided to add a ferry office and a boat donation branch in Chenjiadu, which was approved by the municipal government. The original plan was to build a wooden house and a pier, which is currently being evaluated, but it will take time to complete. To meet current needs, the Finance Bureau has rented a house to establish the boat donation branch, and the Public Works Bureau will use the remaining space to establish the ferry office. It is reported that both will begin operations on May 1st.</p>

<h3>A Servant Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Xue Aqi, a 30-year-old native of Nanjing, who worked as a servant, checked into a room at the Xingmao Inn, number 197 Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession. For unknown reasons, he secretly swallowed raw opium and committed suicide that night. Yesterday morning, the tea server, Tang Changgen, saw that Xue had not yet gotten up, so he went upstairs to call him, but there was no response. He forced the door open and entered the room. Xue had already died on the bed, his body cold. He immediately reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate the inn. They found traces of raw opium that the deceased had swallowed, and determined that the deceased had committed suicide by taking poison. Since there were no family members, the body was sent to the Tongren Zhuan Yuan Hall for an autopsy. The Criminal Section of the police then reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court, who arrived at the hall at 11:00 AM to confirm that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by taking poison. He ordered photographs to be taken, and Tongren Fuyuan Hall prepared a coffin for burial, awaiting family members to claim the body.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The North District Office has sent a lost boy, Jiang Quansheng, to the bureau. After investigation, it was found that Jiang Quansheng is eight years old, from Wuxi, and his father, Jiang Wenhui, has passed away. He used to live near Guangfu Gate in Wuxi. He currently lives in Shanghai. He has a mother and a sister at home. He studied at Peixin Elementary School in Wuxi at the age of six. He has been out of school for a year. This time, he came to Suzhou from Shanghai with his parents and got lost at the station. The child is over three feet tall, with a modern haircut, a long face, and slight pockmarks between his nose. He is wearing a blue striped cloth jacket, a green undershirt, a striped cloth short coat, and blue striped cloth pants, with a striped cloth lining. He is wearing blue western socks and gray cloth shoes with white piping. However, he cannot provide his address in Shanghai. We should summon his family to claim him to avoid him being lost.

<h3>Death of English Poet Laureate Robert Bridges</h3>
<p>Robert Bridges, who was elected Poet Laureate in 1913, died in London on the 21st of this month at the age of eighty-five. He was an eccentric and difficult poet, who earned the honor of being Poet Laureate at the time because of his perseverance, independence, and self-confidence.</p>
<p>He was a doctor in his early years. After leaving Oxford University, he traveled and then went to St. Bartholomew's in London to study medicine and become a military doctor. He also worked as an assistant doctor in a children's hospital and practiced as a doctor. He retired in 1882 and decided to devote himself to literature.</p>
<p>Among the many famous writers in England at the time, Robert Bridges can forever occupy an important position. Although he was a doctor, a skilled doctor who had practiced in hospitals for many years, an inner literary genius had already grown and subdued him. As a result, in 1882 he decided to abandon his medical career and devote himself entirely to literature. When he was appointed Poet Laureate in 1912, he had published very few works, because for many years he had maintained a spirit of perseverance and independence. While others were celebrating and making a big splash, he would silently maintain a period of silence. He had not written a single line of poetry for many years, even though the world was going through an important period, such as the sacrifices made by various countries during the Great War, the commemoration after victory, and the praiseworthy world peace. He ignored all these profound impressions.</p>
<p>At the time, there were many opponents who opposed Bridges' selection as Poet Laureate, saying that such an honor was excessive for him and should be given to Rudyard Kipling, a contemporary English poet, because his talent would never be exhausted at any time. But Bridges remained silent. When he refused to write a poem praising the armistice, he aroused general opposition. He seemed to have his own weapons and was unmoved by those opponents. He said that he was a poet, that poetry was a matter of inspiration, not something to be used as a tool. Let others write what they want to write. As for him, he felt that war was a terrible tragedy and did not arouse the noble emotions that are the foundation of poetry, because it did not inspire him.</p>
<p>His output is small, but the few books of poetry he has are very beautiful, including Eros and Psyche and The Growth of Love. In addition, he has also published two or three memoirs and essays, in which he reveals profound principles of poetry. Recently, he published The Testament of Beauty. (Hui Zi)</p>
<h3>The Beauty Testament of Robert Bridges</h3>
<p>British Poet Laureate</p>
<p>Poems by Robert Bridges</p>
<p>A long poem written by a Poet Laureate is always noteworthy upon its initial publication, regardless of the opinions of critics or the judgments of posterity. The position of Poet Laureate carries a certain traditional, mythical significance, and the Poet Laureate is considered a representative of the poets of a nation. Although this may not necessarily be the case in reality, especially in modern times, it is a given that a Poet Laureate would not be careless or perfunctory. In ancient times, poets in the king's court were very careful to sing praises, portraying the emperor as the most valiant and virtuous figure in their poems. As for the emperor's character after court, that was not within the poet's jurisdiction and need not be considered. Nowadays, for example in England, although there is still an emperor, that situation is long past. Therefore, there is no need for the Poet Laureate to flatter the emperor. However, nominally, the Poet Laureate is still the emperor's poet. Therefore, the Poet Laureate's poems must still be presented for the emperor's viewing. Because of this relationship, the poet's work must be elegant, honest, pure, and dignified. Therefore, it is natural that the Poet Laureate's poems are known for their beauty rather than ugliness, elegance rather than vulgarity, lofty thoughts, and refined tastes.</p>
<p>The works of British Poet Laureate Robert Bridges are such a thing. His new book, "The Testament of Beauty," is said to be his greatest work and a crown of his own making. This is believable because all of his characteristics are expressed in this work, and expressed to the fullest extent. The elegance of the language, the harmony of the rhythm, the tightness of the structure, and the richness of the style are indeed worthy of praise. However, there is too little emotional content. It is difficult for the reader's emotions to be stirred by it. This work is more like a philosophical treatise or a scripture than a poem. For those who like to cultivate their minds with poetry, this work is very appropriate and valuable. But for those who want to get emotional intoxication from poetry, this work will not be a good fit.</p>
<p>This poem is divided into four books and a prologue. The poem is written in alexandrine (each line has twelve syllables), without rhyme. The whole poem has the refreshing flavor of Milton, but without the dramatic emotion of Milton's epic. The opening seven lines of this poem foreshadow the poem's purpose, which we translate below:</p>
<p>Mankind's "wisdom" is the handmaiden of the divine (gods), and his guesses of the goddess of fate are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>We pass through seas of change, in calm or stormy</p>
<p>Days.</p>
<p>When the ship moves forward, our steadfast will</p>
<p>Shakes like the compass in the compass box.</p>
<p>Our stability is only balance, wisdom lies entirely</p>
<p>In the forceful handling of the invisible.</p>
<p>As for beauty, if people want to obtain the beauty of life, their souls must be infused in God, because God is beauty and love.</p>
