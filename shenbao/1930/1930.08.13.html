<h3>中華遠征足球隊之呼援</h3>
<p>南華不援助選星洲球員</p>
<p>（八日一日新嘉坡通訉）中華遠征足球隊先後在星洲及爪哇等巳共賽六次勝二負三和一成績不佳此由於球員受傷替代無人之故也領隊余衡之特於七月二十六日從爪哇乘飛機抵星翌日即乘車轉往吉隆坡向南華商請救兵其心目中人物爲包家平葉北華李天生及馮景祥等數人斯時南華隊轉戰馬來半島十場九勝上述四人之偉績尤有口皆碑果能如願以償加入合作則該隊實力較之今日不啻天壤之别不料余君此行一無所獲緣南華隊隊員事前雖曾允諾隨隊出征此次忽然反覆實因香港南華來電阻制之故也余君於二十九日晨回星洲記者前往訪問得其經過如上述余君並謂「遠征隊曾允許南華加入隊員之一切用度甚至衣服等件亦願供給彼等早願征歐初不料有今日之變更也」云云言下甚爲憤悶是日晨間余君曾與華人體育會會長同往訪新加坡足球會會長鄭連德君所談之事即係商借球員爲赴歐之後備兵也是日下午余君又謂予曰「我輩所欲得南華之加入於歐游實非重要因我輩可於此間（星洲）臨時挑選也」於此可知該晨三人商議借將一事巳有相當之結果星洲體育界聞香港中華南游隊亦不日來此查近月内南華隊遠征隊及未來之中華南游隊將有三大名隊前來華僑眼福可謂不淺惟有識之人士别具隻眼謂彼等可合而爲一則健將雲集實力雄厚必能所向無敵何必各立門户也言時似含有無窮之悲觀也</p>
<h3>萬隆兩戰詳記</h3>
<p>一對一……與萬隆和局</p>
<p>零對一……敗於友尼隊</p>
<p>（七月二十五日萬隆通訉）中華遠征足球隊在萬隆二十三日及二十四日比賽二次一和一負結果巳誌前報兹將二次比賽詳情分誌如左</p>
<h3>（一戰萬隆和局終了）</h3>
<p>上半時萬隆先勝一球</p>
<p>下半時中華奪回一球</p>
<p>七月二十三日四時有半中華隊與萬隆選手隊交鋒之期二隊球員在全塲掌聲中虎步出塲首見南甡公司贈華人隊銀盃一只由隊長李惠堂領收春風滿面得意可知劇戰經過上半時萬隆先勝一球下半時中華奪回一球結果一對一和局</p>
<h3>巿長開球</h3>
<p>雙方分佈陣線蓄勢待發裁判員勒惠特銀笛聲起萬衆觀客精神一振當地巿長步趨塲中行開球禮以資隆重中華五前鋒一鼓作氣蜂擁進攻不久兵臨敵方城下正擬痛飲黄龍然而敵方勢盛力强目的難達且反攻甚烈致我大將孫思敬負痛出塲略爲休息重行入戰</p>
<h3>功虧一簣</h3>
<p>彼此實力相等堪稱仲伯一方重圍方解一方又告戒嚴然中華以守門周賢言扼守有方後衛堅强可靠故中華前鋒進展之機會較多李惠堂阨於足疾致不能發揮其往昔神化之脚頭得最後之成功</p>
<h3>龍門失守</h3>
<p>彼此相持二十五分鐘均未占得便宜中華固有破敵之能然多因足傷乏力難收全功滿塲華僑觀衆爲之心焦神亂忽而對方乘我不備深入腹地左翼沿邊陲騐進挑起一脚球向中央李寗躍身抵禦爲敵所阻脫空落在右内鋒足旁順水推船周賢言力救不及龍門失守上半時中華負一球矣</p>
<h3>背水大戰</h3>
<p>中華在優越形勢之下反而先告失守天不估我令人痛心下半塲起陳家球腹痛出塲由梁榮德代替梁亦足疾未愈不得巳負傷應戰孫中衛舊傷復發步伐艱難所幸背水大戰勇不可當且有陳鎮和身强力壯全塲兼顧故敵雖兇惡亦戰得勢均力敵與上半塲相彷彿耳</p>
<h3>痛飲黄龍</h3>
<p>十餘分鐘之韶光轉眼巳過華僑渴望報復之議大有朝食之勢福將戴中鋒穿陣探險歷破要隘單槍匹馬直抵龍門舉脚猛射應聲入網華僑大喜若狂掌聲如雷蓋巳得如願以償也心不貪足滿望中華得最後之勝利乃敵方死力相安無機可乘結果一對一和局</p>
<h3>（二）中華水戰受敵挫</h3>
<p>零對一敗於友尼</p>
<p>國際改爲友誼賽</p>
<p>二十四日晨萬隆大雨紐號特熱斯特球塲幾成澤國致比賽不克於規定時間舉行四時四十分時隂雲仍未散去仍力謀繼續比賽因觀衆擁擠不堪中且多有不遠百里而來者球證委員及各職員均卸雨衣帮同整理球場如填沙等惜觀衆則絶不願帮忙此不足怪因觀衆多著西裝佛蘭絨褲及光亮皮鞋穿著如是衣履其必不願週旋於泥中也</p>
<h3>觀衆抗議</h3>
<p>四時四十五分球證與委員會及其他當局會商比賽與否討論頗久觀衆尤其士人多因不耐久待而狂呼亂喊五時零八分友尼隊入塲其時比賽與否尚未决定而土人觀衆抗議之聲巳甚沸矣塲中突現小紛擾中華隊員時在看臺當局請其勸衆安靜李惠堂遂入塲向衆正式發言然「踢罷踢罷」之聲猶不絶於耳也</p>
<h3>友誼比賽</h3>
<p>最後决定比賽惟因球塲巳成澤國不能認爲國際大比賽而僅爲友誼式之比賽比賽時間爲兩個二十分鐘而非兩個三十分鐘球證范赫爾登遠征隊陣法如左</p>
<p>周賢言馮運佑李寗梁運德孫思敬安原生陳光耀李惠堂戴麟經陳家球曹桂成</p>
<h3>表示謙讓</h3>
<p>比賽甫開遼征隊巳繼續圍攻敵門至十分鐘之久戴麟經數得良機惜其非蹴出門外即被茂伯拉得爾所接住五時三十五分白騰於二門内手觸球李惠堂立於球後但因此項比賽僅爲友誼比賽乃故將其緩緩向旁踢去</p>
<h3>友尼勝球</h3>
<p>中華屢攻友尼形勢頗桂當五時四十八分友尼突遭中華之圍攻努力抵抗忽而破圍而出大舉反攻顧浮登射擊一球中間又加　淨斯之一脚經此變化周賢言爲之措手不及打入門内友尼遂勝一球</p>
<h3>反攻不利</h3>
<p>休息以後陳鎮和代陳光耀出陣斯時比賽益形劇烈中華隊猛壓迫在友尼門前頗有爭執球被踢成角球但客軍不能藉此取勝中華隊現再進攻幸被范德伯騰擋住兩軍實力可謂勢均力敵天色至是益爲黑喑特開電燈以便作戰觀衆極力擁護中華隊李惠堂等進迫友尼隊守門人但顧浮登將球踢往塲外觀衆大聲嚮喊似因中華進攻不和而感懊傷也當時友尼球門不斷的被球射擊友尼左翼顧浮登且向後相助但無效果足球復被奪去戴麟經等乃復進迫萬隆球門訖無效果足球如非向旁或向上飛去便入友尼守門人范白拉德耳手中中華隊遂以零對一失敗</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論貨車發展史中的一段絶妙言論  志　　汽車代火車先進幾受窘　左手輔右手妙語堪解頣　　運貨汽車近幾年來可稱得突飛猛進進步無涯了不要從别處看吧單拿美國對外貿易來說一九二八年貨車出口不過一六三·九九○輛到了一九二九年便跳上幾乎一倍計二三五·○八二輛佔全部汽車出口總額的百分之四十以默默無聞的貨車一躍而到如此地位其勢當然令人舌撟不下了說起運貨汽車的改良五年以來變化萬端原來是震動不堪的現在安如磐石了原來是慢速率的現在變爲高速度了本來是四缸的現在居然有了六缸了這些以及還有種種汽車每週評論報都詳細叙述過的　　此刻一般用户多半不注意到上述的改良其實也許是用慣了不然你試拿一九二五年一九二六年的貨車來比較你便覺得進步的可驚嘆爲三年成績爲十五年所不及的了事實告訴我們是如此而無可爲諱的　　今年是一九三零年運貨汽車也在此開了一個新紀元因爲機件内部如齧合子傳速機前後輪等等都有不少的發明和改善先談車身此刻一般廠家都採用經過化學家試騐而認爲滿意的鋼鐵造的鋼鐵之中另有化合物使車格外耐久車輪呢現在一致趨向於飛機輪胎從前多是用的硬胎如今驟然改爲輕軟飛行胎無怪乎大家要驚異了從前人家以爲貨車之輪一定要用硬胎何以呢因爲運車載重多用軟胎不能支持長久結果是不經濟其實這種推論是謬誤的如事實上證明硬胎遠不及軟胎的經濟而且用了軟胎之後震動也可减少真是一舉而數利備道前人所未道呢最有趣的便是從前的工程師來繪製一輛貨車常用一個公式以這個公式來定底盤的輕重方法是這樣的先計算車輪的載重量這是標明的譬如我要造一輛載重一噸的貨車而選用的車胎是載重二噸的那麽我的底盤里量便是一噸必不能超過此數現在呢巳棄了這個方法不用了由汽車工程協會（S.　A.　E.）來規定一個標準照標準去造車又便宜又不麻煩尺寸各各不同完全照協會規定去做各式都是齊備的　　下面是自動車公司總工程師白區門對於運貨車的意見「過去三年間貨車巳由附帶營業而變爲主要營業了將來呢運貨車的用途可以說一定是愈用愈廣而無庸疑義的照發達的程度看上去現在的六缸車依然是不夠一定要有八缸車發現因爲載重增加其勢非增加動力不可而且上山時候更須有推進力至於四輪掣動機我可保險說一句一定就要介紹到貨車上來坐位的舒適驾　的便利巳成爲當今最急迫的要求　之凡是客車的優點從前認爲不必　到貨車來的現在却定要用着了」　　提起了六缸車却有一位功臣不可不記的便是固特異橡皮公司的總理利區費爾當時他知道如果載重增加原有車胎一定要擔當不起他想起了發明一種合雙輪爲單輪的車胎那時候還是一九一八年不到三十天這個新鮮東西巳在巿上發售了雖然望上去是笨點然而它要行了一○·○○○里的途程纔會損壞呢　　一九一九年的五月繪製六缸貨車圖案的使命便輪在我（原作者自稱）身上起初呢以派卡車來實騐跑了幾千里路經過阿剛·屋海塢·波士登等處而回成績尚稱不差但是後來又發覺了不滿意地方因之另造了兩輛五噸車特點如下（一）有充裕之動力可使五噸車每小時行四十英里（二）齒輪自動滑潤這五噸車都是六輪的起初呢對於如何轉變問題也費了不少的研究後來經過許多試騐也解决了因此我最初實騐獲得些結果以上拉雜談了許多雖與貨車發展無關但也是有趣味的掌故要知道貨車本身的歷史不過一二十年辛苦的研究以及民衆的提倡讒有今日可說是不是容易事談起貨車爲什麽如此發達也有人常懷疑地問着我我總笑着說因爲它是「無軌的小火車」呀第一它能如火車一樣的載貨可是所載不及火車多然而日常運輸這巳狠夠了况且現在正在向上發展載重當可希望慢慢加增第二火車要受軌道的束縛而汽車是絶對自由的它不但走大城巿大都會並且可以走小村鎮運送到窮鄉僻壞去這一點火車是望塵莫及了第三是費用省每星所費以及購辦費都不必巨在資金因此三利貨車便益加蓬勃起來　　「那麽火車何不盡代以汽車呢」一位朋友詰難我　　「火車與汽車是相輔的不是相殺的各有各的好處各有各的妙用朋友你有了右手又何必要左手呢」　　朋友也笑了（譯自汽車每週評論報於交通大學）直式八汽缸之特色  沛甘　　美國之良好道路其有關於汽車事業之發達異常彰明而公衆亦因之以求良好之汽車俾於往來旅行之時得到便易快速及舒適之結果關於此點汽車必須大而平穩舍汽缸之增加外别無他道因此之故許多著名之汽車製造家均傾其全力致意於八汽缸汽車之製造淺言之欲令汽車之力量增加者在汽車引擎之内部厥有兩途一爲增大汽缸之式樣一即添加汽缸是也　　凡用巨大之汽缸者其爆發必大拐臂軸之式樣及重量均須加大即其他各部份亦應用樣增加其理甚爲明顯職是之故無所求其平穩及適應於變動也事實上言之由四汽缸而改至六汽缸時此種增大汽缸之辦法巳視爲不適於實用降至今日此六汽缸者亦巳被著名之機師視爲不充足及不適用　　較大之適應變動性與動力相輔並進者祗有從多汽缸之裝置求之此蓋由於用較小之汽缸則動力之推進較輕而其接合則較密對於平穩方面受益可多且變速减少感應之加速增加泥潭沙土中之拖動力亦爲之大增上山之時行動便易直式八汽缸所生之動力互相溶化併合而産生一種不變之絲樣汽體動力能令汽車進行時推動之力堅定而震撼减少　　直式八汽缸車之平穩於抵速率進行中極易覺得而且感應加速增加甚多變速减少八汽缸之最低速度推動力在峻峭之山區進行時亦異常卓越加以動力之推進密接其推動之堅定較之普通者增加甚多八汽缸引擎之第二步利益照麥蒙機師所改良者爲其安全之動作增加其生存之時間蓋據事實上言馬達之受損較爲稀少也此外如每一汽缸之煤氣爆發較少則其震動及活塞之燒灼自亦較少活塞較一般者爲小而輕其受損亦較淺小汽缸之式樣不易走動能常保其圓形式樣更因引擎震動之减少對於車盤及車身之受損亦能减少此外螺絲釘等不易鬆散電繳亦難於損壞精巧之部份不致受震　　論及經濟一道直式八汽缸能减少汽油之消耗額此爲工程學上基本之高壓縮原理更因活塞之頭其形較小納吸較少之熱氣汽油於未焚之前即能壓縮之最高度其效率乃亦甚大每一小滴之汽油均能爆發是也此項壓縮之力有時於下山時亦能充任輪掣之功用可使駕駛者用力較少而輪掣耗損之較少又其餘事焉凡上所述均爲直式八汽缸之特殊優點麥蒙汽車公司自一九二六年起即注持其全力從事於直式八汽缸汽車之製造及至今日巳有四年製造此項汽車之獨有經騐其式樣計有四種售價亦各不同至於此項汽車爲公衆需要由事實上可以覘之即以美國一處而論今年三十五家汽車製造廠中其二十家均在製造八汽缸之模型也韋廉斯汽車之穩靜  曲紫　　韋廉斯奥佛蘭公司工程師於計劃新韋廉斯六汽缸車之前以「汽車徒有高速率而不能行駛穩靜者何貴之有」一語爲金科玉律故其設計也一方面求機力偉大速率高超一方面復求駕駛穩靜乘坐舒適結果此新韋廉斯六汽缸車</p>

<p>Administrative Management Plan After the Recovery of Weihaiwei</p>
<p>Planned as a Municipality Directly Under the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Drafts Organizational Regulations</p>
<p>The Yuan Orders the Five Ministries to Review</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of recovering Weihaiwei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that a special treaty and agreement have been signed between China and Britain. After the exchange of documents, the takeover can be implemented. However, the specific methods for administrative management after the takeover must be decided in advance. The matters that need to be decided can be roughly divided into three types: (1) Convert it into a naval port as a base for the Chinese Navy. However, it will be impossible to start without raising tens of millions of dollars in funds. (2) Convert it into a county or a municipality under the province. This seems possible. However, its status is the same as Qingdao. If Weihaiwei is converted into a county or a municipality under the province, the future of the municipality will inevitably be inferior. When China recovers other concessions in the future, foreigners will use the pretext of China's poor municipal administration and be unwilling to return them. (3) Convert it into a municipality directly under the central government. Since the first method is difficult to implement temporarily due to financial reasons, and the second method is not suitable for the status of Weihaiwei, then it may be possible to convert it into a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Organizational Law, so that the municipality's administration can develop day by day to prevent foreigners from using excuses in the future. Therefore, after taking over Weihaiwei, adopting the third method is the most appropriate. The Ministry has now drafted the Weihaiwei Organizational Regulations and the Organizational Details of the Various Bureaus based on the above principles and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. It is reported that the Yuan has ordered the five ministries of Communications, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Navy, and Finance to review them, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will convene a meeting (Special Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>The draft of the Weihaiwei Organizational Regulations drafted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs consists of 24 articles. The main points are: (1) The municipality shall be organized in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 3 of the Municipal Organization Law promulgated by the National Government and shall be directly under the Executive Yuan. (2) The municipality shall be divided into districts, neighborhoods, and lanes. The delineation or alteration of its area shall be decided by the Yuan and submitted to the government. (3) The municipality shall establish a municipal government to administer the municipal administrative affairs in accordance with laws and regulations and supervise subordinate agencies and autonomous organizations. (4) The municipality shall establish a mayor, who shall be a simplified appointee, and a secretary-general. It shall also establish four bureaus: Social Affairs, Public Security, Finance, and Public Works, each with a director, who shall be a simplified appointee or a recommended appointee. (5) The municipality shall establish a municipal council in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Municipal Organization Law. Its organizational law and the election law for municipal councilors shall be determined separately by the central government by law. (6) The municipality shall establish district people's congresses, district offices, district people's representative conferences, district supervisory committees, neighborhood people's congresses, neighborhood offices, and neighborhood supervisory committees after the district chiefs are elected by the people with the approval of the Ministry of Interior (Special Dispatch of the 12th)</p>

<h3>The North West Frontier Uprising in India</h3>
<p>It is not a time for nonviolent resistance in India, but suddenly there is the matter of the Northwest Frontier's invasion of the North West Frontier Province and the British troops have been confronting it for many days, but the cause has not yet been determined. According to the British side, it is said to be due to the instigation of Muslim teachers, and that this matter should not be regarded as a tribal rebellion. Most of the enemy are young people who are obviously incited by bad people. It is also said that the tribe's reckless and distant offense is indeed strange. Although the cause is not specified, it has aroused great suspicion. The North West Frontier Province is the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, guarding the border's vital points and the passage between Central Asian countries. Its land trade with Afghanistan, Persia, Central Asia, and other places is particularly prosperous. For the British, for the sake of their own interests, they will not neglect it. For India, it is related to the important border area and must pay more attention. However, since this incident occurred, the Nationalist Party, which advocates the nonviolent movement, has not made any statement. Why? Is the purpose of the Afridis this time to resist Britain and sympathize with nonviolent resistance? However, sympathizing with nonviolence and resorting to violence is contrary to Gandhi's doctrine and must not be what the Indians want to do. Is its purpose only to resist Britain and have nothing to do with the Indian nonviolent movement? Then, the occurrence of this kind of action at this time is easy to arouse British suspicion and it is difficult to ensure that it will not hinder the nonviolent progress. Therefore, no matter what its purpose, those who advocate the nonviolent movement should make a statement to clarify their consistent adherence to nonviolence. Today, although the Afridis' attack on the North West Frontier Province has been gradually driven out by the British army, the situation is still very serious. I believe that it is fortunate for India that it will not expand further and hinder the nonviolent progress.</p>

Tianjin merchants have now appealed to senior officials in Beiping, saying that they cannot bear the burden of further exorbitant taxes at a time when commerce is declining and people are struggling to survive (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>

<p>Chaos Escalates in Muzaffar Region</p>
<h3>Reuter's News Agency, North West Frontier Province, 11th</h3>
<p>The Afridis who previously entered the military depot outside the North West Frontier Province were driven out last night, and they fled into the surrounding gardens. British soldiers used artillery to fiercely attack them throughout the night. Another group of Afridis attempted to enter the city of North West Frontier Province, but three were killed and many wounded by bombing. Telegraphic communication between this area and Lahore has been cut off. Except for one freight train, no trains entered or left North West Frontier Province yesterday. The freight train was bombed, injuring a fireman. The Afridis also dismantled the railway near the city of North West Frontier Province. Today, the artillery fire from the North West Frontier Province fortress continues ceaselessly, and the city gates of North West Frontier Province remain closed. Groups of Afridis move back and forth in the gardens outside the city.</p>

<p>[P Reuter's News Agency, Karachi, 11th</p>
<p>The chaotic atmosphere within Muzaffar is gradually escalating. British troops have been stationed in several locations, and armed police have also been dispatched to various districts on the left bank of the Indus River. Tensions are high between Indian Muslims and Hindus.</p>
<p>[P Reuter's News Agency, London, 11th</p>
<p>The Indian government reported on the 9th regarding the situation in India for the past week, stating that the Afridis who attacked the North West Frontier Province seem to be collapsing. There have been serious conflicts between Indian Muslims and Hindus in the Sindh region, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. According to the latest news, the situation there has not yet been fully resolved. The reports from various provinces in the latter half of July were the most satisfactory, the best in months. The general situation has improved, the authorities in Gujarat have gradually gained the upper hand, and the anti-government agitation is gradually losing its effectiveness. The non-violent resistance movement is now most intense in the Central Provinces, where the riotous flames are more severe than elsewhere, but the stringent measures of the authorities are gradually taking effect in the areas where incidents occurred. The movement to boycott foreign goods has now spread, but there are many merchants who disregard the National Congress's ban on foreign goods. As the rule of law is being disregarded, criminal cases are increasing. Reports from various provinces mostly state that cases of violence have increased, and the illegal brewing of alcohol has gradually become prevalent after the operation of speakeasies was disrupted by inspectors. However, the fact that the public subscription to the Indian government's recent public debt reached approximately 300 million rupees shows that Indian investors trust the stability of the Indian government.</p>
<p>French Army and Air Force to Hold Large Autumn Exercises</p>
<p>Bragging and Showing off Military Strength Only Harms Neighboring Countries' Feelings</p>
<p>[P National News Agency, Paris, 11th</p>
<p>The French Army Department has denied rumors that the autumn exercises in Alsace and Lorraine, near the German border, will be canceled or scaled back due to the outbreak of infantile paralysis in the area. It also announced that similar large-scale exercises will be held in the Alpine mountains near the Italian border, with Alpine mountain artillery teams, tank vehicles, and air squadrons participating in the exercises. However, opposition newspapers criticized the government's move, saying that it would increase tensions between France and Italy, and that the autumn exercises in Alsace would inevitably hurt the feelings of the Germans, which is unwise.</p>
<p>Germans Enthusiastically Celebrate the Anniversary of the Promulgation of the Constitution</p>
<p>Interior Minister Urges National Unity and the Promotion of Democracy</p>
<p>[P National News Agency, Berlin, 11th</p>
<p>Today marks the eleventh anniversary of the promulgation of the Republican Constitution in Germany, and grand celebrations are being held throughout the country. In the capital, formal celebrations began at noon. The German President, along with all cabinet members, the diplomatic corps, and important political figures, went to the Reichstag to attend the celebratory ceremony. Interior Minister Wels spoke, urging the people to unite and consolidate, allowing the young German Republic to weather the storms. He also stated that since the completion of the Young Plan, disputes in foreign policy have been reduced, and domestic policy has been followed, becoming a battlefield for political struggles and class hatred, so that the immature German democracy, having overcome foreign difficulties, will again experience the difficulties of domestic politics. He then severely refuted the theory of the dictatorship system, saying that some people are currently proposing to imitate certain countries to establish a dictatorship system, but the current government will use all its strength to oppose anyone who wants to destroy today's democratic government, regardless of where they come from. In short, we should now be grateful for the achievements of the past and hope for a brighter future, continuing to work to create a bright future. Please let us act together to complete the democratic system. Whoever acts in good faith, we welcome their cooperation to achieve great success. After Wells finished speaking, Prime Minister Brüning delivered a speech, praising the patriotic spirit of the people of the Rhineland during the ten years of foreign military occupation, and reiterated Wells's intention to call on the nation to unite and consolidate democracy, saying that this is the only way to complete freedom, and asked the people of the country to be trustworthy, patient and prudent in the elections, and not to use violence. Finally, he shouted three times, "Long live the motherland! Long live the Republican Constitution!" The whole place responded with thunderous applause, then the national anthem was played and the meeting was dismissed. In the evening, there was also a grand lantern parade passing through the historically famous Linden Street to the square in front of the Reichstag, with no less than tens of thousands of participants. Although the weather was bad today, with occasional showers, the people's enthusiasm for the celebration was not diminished.</p>
<h3>Soviet Conspiracy Against China</h3>
<p>Transferring Large Sums of Money to Organize the Chinese Communist Party</p>
<p>Willing to Cede Territory to Japan to Prevent its Interference</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch: Regarding the recent communist uprising in Hunan, China, former Russian staff member of the Paris Embassy, ​​Mr. Pishito-Fursky, made a statement to the Paris press: "After Chiang Kai-shek expelled Borodin in 1927, the Soviet government felt it necessary to establish a communist party in China. In that year, I was serving as the Russian Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo and was ordered by the government to transfer 2.5 million gold yuan to He Long and Ye Ting for the purpose of forming a party. I initially refused to comply because I was concerned that this action would be known to the Japanese government and suspect me of trying to spread communism in Japan. Before long, I received instructions again, regardless of the circumstances, the funds had to be remitted. I then sent a counselor from the embassy to China to secretly hand over the funds to the leaders of the Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party, which still exists today, was soon organized and established. When I was appointed as the Chargé d'Affaires in Japan and left Moscow, Stalin told me that one of my main missions was to help China become a communist country, and at the same time, to find ways to prevent the Japanese government from interfering in the activities of the Communist Party in China. Stalin even said that if necessary, the Soviet government would be willing to cede a certain territory east of Irkutsk to Japan in exchange for Japan's non-interference." (World News)</p>
<p>According to reports, after leaving Tokyo, Pishito was transferred to the Russian Embassy in Paris. Last year, due to a certain case, he had a disagreement with the Russian government, and the Russian government ordered him to return to the country. Pishito refused to comply. In January of this year, the Moscow court accused him of embezzling public funds and sentenced him to ten years in prison in absentia. Pishito still resides in Paris.</p>

<p>Turkish Government Submits Further Representations</p>
<h3>Reuter's News Agency, Constantinople, 11th</h3>
<p>Persia has rejected Turkey's proposal for a joint military operation to suppress the Kurdish tribes, causing a negative impression in Ankara's political circles. Today, the Turkish government again made representations to the Persian government, requesting a statement within three days on whether it is willing to cooperate with the Turkish army to suppress the 1,500 Kurds currently holding Mount Ararat.</p>
<p>Strike Wave in Northern France</p>
<p>Military Police on High Alert</p>
<p>The Situation Remains Tense</p>
<h3>National News Agency, Paris, 11th</h3>
<p>Today, military police in the strike-stricken areas of northern France are on high alert, as if in a state of encirclement. Roubaix and Tourcoing are particularly tightly guarded. The situation remains tense. In Lille, several thousand people have resumed work this morning, showing great progress. As for Roubaix and Tourcoing, the situation is like a large military camp, with troops patrolling back and forth with bayonets fixed in all the thoroughfares, not allowing pedestrians to linger. This morning, the authorities issued a notice strictly warning the local people that if they do not resume work, they must stay at home and not go out. The conflict between the socialist and communist factions has not yet materialized, but the communist faction is more powerful and absolutely cannot accept the wage increase of 25 centimes per hour accepted by the socialist faction, so the future is not easy to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Typhoon Strikes Japan Again</p>
<p>Nagasaki Citizens Take Precautions</p>
<p>Kagoshima City Plunged into Darkness</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Society, Nagasaki, 12th</h3>
<p>Another typhoon struck the Nagasaki area at noon today. The wind was very strong. It suddenly stopped at 2 PM and then increased again at 3 PM. Currently (4 PM), the wind is still very strong. According to observations from the weather station, the temporary cessation of the wind indicates that the eye of the typhoon has entered the area. The current wind speed is 25-26 meters per second, momentarily reaching 33 meters, and it will continue for several hours. Considering the previous typhoon disaster, the citizens have closed their doors and windows tightly, and are taking all necessary precautions, so the damage is relatively light.</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>The Kagoshima area continues to be plagued by the typhoon. Another severe typhoon struck last night. The Kagoshima pier was washed away by the raging waves, and many fishing boats were lost. Telegraphic and telephone communications were temporarily cut off, and electric power lines were also cut, plunging the entire city into darkness. Fortunately, people and animals were unharmed.</p>
<h3>Japan United News, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>The Kyushu region, which is directly in the path of the second typhoon, has been gradually affected from Kagoshima Prefecture in the south to northern Kyushu since the morning of the 11th. Ships, trains, telegraphic and telephone communications are all disrupted, and the damage from flooding is severe in various places. Since this morning, the typhoon near Shimonoseki has been the most severe. The Kanmon ferry and all commercial ships have been suspended.

<p>Japanese Privy Council Appoints Investigative Committee Members</p>
<p>Definitely Unfavorable to the Government</p>
<h3>Japan United News, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>The members of the London Treaty Review Committee were nominated by the Chairman of the Privy Council yesterday afternoon, as follows: Chairman: Ito Miyoji; Members: Kaneko Kentaro, Kubota Yosuke, Yamakawa Kenjiro, Taguchi Ukichi, Kuroda Narinari, Kawai Misao, Mizumachi Kesazuro, Arai Kentaro.</p>
<p>Observing the factions of the committee members, Ito and Kaneko have long been considered the most vocal attackers of the government within the Privy Council. Kubota and Taguchi also have strong anti-government sentiments. Kawai</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Misao, from the perspective of a military expert, will inevitably take an attacking stance on issues related to military strength and the authority of the supreme commander. Only Yamakawa and Kuroda are more neutral. Mizumachi, who was selected for his expertise in finance, although slightly sympathetic to the government, faces difficult hurdles related to the national defense budget and surplus funds from disarmament. In terms of duties, he and Arai may raise considerably strong and insightful questions. As for the first meeting of the investigative committee, since the review materials received by each member yesterday are minimal, it will take at least two to three days to read and review them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the meeting can only be convened around the 18th.</p>
<p>Kansai Financial Tycoon, Gan Shinbei, Imprisoned</p>
<p>Another Japanese Bribery Case Exposed</p>
<p>Involving Many Important Political Figures</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>Mr. Gan Shinbei, a 68-year-old Kansai financial giant, was summoned yesterday by the Tokyo District Court and investigated by Prosecutor Ishigo Oka. He was then subjected to compulsory detention prior to indictment for the crime of breach of trust and embezzlement, and was detained in the Ichigaya Prison. All parties were shocked upon receiving this news and predicted that a new bribery case would occur. The content of the crime is that after Mr. Koguchi Asaji, of the Yamaju Filature Company, gained power in the Nagano Prefecture filature industry, he excessively expanded the business. When the reaction occurred, the company suffered huge losses, so he acquired the Asahi Life Insurance Company and had Asahi buy the Yamaju shares, which had plummeted to one-tenth of their face value, at face value, which was a kind of bitter trick. When both companies were in financial trouble, they sought help from Gan Shinbei. Gan planned to seize the conspiracy of the two companies, skillfully manipulated his well-known congressmen and political figures to carry out the campaign. When the Ministry of Commerce and Industry inspected the books of Asahi Life, it discovered irregularities and immediately filed a lawsuit. Because Gan Shinbei was good at campaigning, he was able to get away with it, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry lamented it. Today, it was finally exposed due to the activity of the prosecutor's office of the Tokyo District Court. The prosecutor's office first ordered Mr. Koguchi Asaji, the person in charge of Yamaju, to come forward, but he claimed illness and hid in his Kamakura villa. He was not summoned until yesterday morning. As a result of the interrogation of Gan Shinbei, Gan's agent Yamamoto Otsugoro, and Kawabe Junryu, an executive of the Yamaju Land Company, they were also detained in Ichigaya Prison last night. Many other political figures are involved, so as the incident progresses, it will inevitably implicate many people, causing conflicts from all sides. According to the Hochi Shimbun, Gan Shinbei also had a plan to seize the Watanabe Warehouse when Watanabe Bank collapsed.</p>
<h3>Japan United News, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>It is reported that Gan Shinbei lent a huge sum of 3 million yen to Tanaka Giichi when he entered the political world as chairman of the Seiyukai. Since then, Gan has used his financial power to profit 100 million yen in various cases such as the Sho River water rights issue, the Matsushima incident, the Russo-Japanese fisheries issue that caused international disputes the year before last, and the Kanoetsu Railway case. This year's income tax has reached 300,000 yen, and his position is comparable to that of the Japanese billionaire Sumitomo.</p>
<p>Japanese Unemployed Laborers Sharply Increase</p>
<p>Local Debt Exceeds 20 Million Yen</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs has established unemployment countermeasures centered on relief for day laborers, but according to statistics in mid-April, the number of unemployed day laborers is 1.6 million, and the number of unemployed skilled laborers has reached 3.8 million. The Ministry of Home Affairs is surprised by the sharp increase and has begun to change its policy, studying measures to shorten working hours and adjust production as a fundamental strategy, and making efforts in job-creation projects and vocational guidance as emergency measures.</p>
<h3>Electric Communication Society, Tokyo, 12th</h3>
<p>The current government, which proclaims a policy of not raising debt, has permitted local governments to raise debt for unemployment countermeasures. According to a survey by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the amount of approved debt in January has exceeded 20 million yen and is trending upward. The most notable are the 10 million yen for the Tokyo City water and sewage and road construction costs, the 3.5 million yen for the Osaka City hotel construction costs, and the 5 million yen for the Yokohama City waterworks construction costs. Civil engineering projects that should have been borne by the central government are now being borne by local governments.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Circles Comfort the Ninth Route Army</h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence, 9th of the month: Zhu Mao recently led more than 10,000 bandits in an attempt to attack Nanchang and spy on Jiujiang, hoping to exit the Yangtze River. Lu Diping, commander of the Ninth Route Army, supervised the 18th Division in firmly defending Nanxun, waiting for the enemy in a relaxed manner so that the bandits' plan could not succeed. Various popular organizations in this city raised more than 20,000 yuan to comfort the various units suppressing the bandits. Yesterday morning at 12 o'clock, Mayor Gong Shizeng, Chairman of the Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce Lu Fang, Committee Member Zeng Zhanggui, etc., took 15,000 yuan in cash, 18,000 towels, 1,000 bottles of medicine, 1,000 cans, 600,000 return cakes, and a comfort letter from all circles to the headquarters of the Ninth Route Army. Commander Lu personally came out to meet the representatives and expressed his gratitude. Then, Zeng Zhanggui reported on the recent financial situation of the city. Lu represented the Ninth Route Army in expressing his thanks and said that when Zhu Mao attacked Nanxun in an attempt to spy on the Yangtze River, the government had already established a complete plan to deal with it. First, the municipal government and the General Chamber of Commerce raised 30,000 yuan to build defense works near the city, and then the provincial government added another layer of construction. Now, it is planned to add another layer of obstacles at the fortress farther away from the city. With these three layers of obstacles, the security of the provincial capital will be further consolidated. At the moment, Zhu Mao has been defeated and retreated by our army to the Gao'an, Fengxin, Anyi, and Jing'an area. Judging from the situation, it seems that they are uniting with Peng Dehuai, but this Route Army will always firmly defend Nanchang and will never relax a step. Moreover, Zhu Mao is a ragtag mob, and now the central army has also arrived in Jiangxi and can wipe out the communists. There is another point that I want to state: I will never kill a single person indiscriminately, but communists must be killed. Raising tumors is only enough to leave hidden dangers. The fall of Changsha was only a tragedy that happened with only dozens of communist riots that initially occurred; this is very disheartening, he said. The representatives then bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province Reserves Grain</p>
<p>Loans 600,000 Yuan to Various Counties</p>
<p>Purchase All Grain and Transport it to the Province as Military Supplies</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: Jiangxi Province is a rice-producing area. This year's autumn harvest is abundant, and the early rice in various counties has already been harvested. The new grain is pouring in, but the provincial capital is recently crowded with troops suppressing bandits, and there is concern that it will be difficult to sustain them. As military supplies are the lifeline of the army and people's food is closely related to public security, the provincial government decided at yesterday's provincial affairs meeting to borrow 600,000 yuan from Nanchang and other counties to purchase rice and grain and transport it to the province for military and civilian food, in accordance with the precedent of the Northern Expedition loan in 1928. This loan will be repaid first when the land tax is collected. If it is still insufficient, it will be drawn from this year's grain transport. The Civil Affairs and Finance Departments have telegraphed the amount to be borrowed from each county and ordered the county magistrates to borrow the money and transport the grain to the province within 15 days to meet the emergency needs. The amount to be borrowed from each county is as follows: Nanchang 35,000 yuan, Xinjian 20,000 yuan, Fengcheng 60,000 yuan, Linchuan 60,000 yuan, Poyang 60,000 yuan, Qingjiang 45,000 yuan, Xinyu 20,000 yuan, Shanggao 20,000 yuan, Jinxian 25,000 yuan, Dongxiang 30,000 yuan, Guixi 20,000 yuan, Duchang 20,000 yuan, Chongren 25,000 yuan, Yihuang 25,000 yuan, Jinxi 30,000 yuan, Yuqian 25,000 yuan, Yujiang 20,000 yuan, Pengze 20,000 yuan, Nancheng 20,000 yuan, Yongxiu 20,000 yuan, totaling 600,000 silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Unemployed and Returning Home</h3>
<p>Returning Home in Batches, Landing in Shantou and Hong Kong</p>
<p>Unemployment Caused by the Decline of the Rubber and Tin Industries</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Recently, the number of overseas Chinese returning home from Nanyang has been increasing daily. In the past week, no fewer than six or seven batches of returnees have arrived in Shantou from the Nanyang area, with each batch numbering from dozens to hundreds of people. These returning overseas Chinese are mostly laborers, and their faces are all pale, as if they have suffered hunger and cold. In Hong Kong, groups of hundreds of Nanyang overseas Chinese have also been returning home. When Nanyang ships arrive in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government dispatches people to repatriate these overseas Chinese to Guangdong. Therefore, in recent days, this kind of impoverished overseas Chinese can be seen wandering on the streets of Guangzhou, a truly pitiable sight. According to these unemployed overseas Chinese, the reason for their return to their homeland is purely due to the decline of the rubber industry in the Nanyang area. The value of rubber has plummeted. Previously, rubber was worth three to four hundred yuan per picul, but recently it has fallen to a dozen yuan. Rubber companies and factories have closed down one after another. In addition, tin ore has always been a major export commodity in Nanyang, but recently, due to the price drop, stockpiles have accumulated and sales have stagnated. The two industries jointly decided to suspend tin ore mining in April and rubber tapping in May. With the suspension of these two major industries, the workers in both industries were also laid off. So far, almost all the tin miners have been dismissed, and only two-fifths of those tapping rubber have been retained. The remaining three-fifths of the workers have been forced to become beggars. The local resident government has tried to repatriate all these unemployed workers to China in order to maintain public order. Therefore, those who are wandering in the streets are being deported. The recent returnees landing in Shantou and Hong Kong are these unemployed and pitiful overseas Chinese. In order to maintain the local industry, the Singapore government, in addition to repatriating unemployed Chinese workers, is also afraid that Chinese workers will continue to flock to the area, so it has introduced what is called the restriction of Chinese workers' entry. The extent of the restriction is not absolute prohibition, but rather a restriction on the number of passengers on ships. For example, a ship with a capacity of one thousand passengers is only allowed to carry three hundred and fifty Chinese workers. All ships are treated in this manner. In other words, each ship is only allowed to carry 35% Chinese workers. The purpose of this restriction is to prevent an overabundance of Chinese workers in Singapore. However, those traveling to Singapore for travel or business are still allowed to enter and exit freely. It is reported that the regulation restricting the import of Chinese workers has been implemented on August 5 and is valid for three months (August 8th).</p>
<h3>The Crab-Backed Beauty That Caused a Sensation in Chaoshan</h3>
<p>Now on Display at the Shantou Poor People's Institute</p>
<p>Shantou correspondence: He Daxu, from He Dahu's village in Jieyang Panxi, opened a brick factory in Shantou Huawu. He has a grandson, Lin Yaoqin, who caught fish and shrimp on the banks of the Shimumu Mountain stream outside Panxi on July 12th. He unintentionally caught a field crab. The crab's shell is about four square inches and is light yellow and transparent like wax paper. The crab's internal organs are vaguely visible. On the shell, there is a half-length portrait of a beautiful woman, with bright eyes and white teeth, and a lifelike appearance. Sometimes, she slightly opens her rosy lips, looking both angry and smiling. Her eyes do not move, but she often throws a flirtatious glance at the viewer. However, she cannot speak. The crab is still living in a pottery pot, kept in clear water. Every time the crab breathes, the beauty on its back makes various seductive gestures. Some say that this is a transformation of the crab's roe. Lin Yaoqin brought it back to He Daxu's home from outside the village. The villagers were surprised. Neighbors flocked to see it, and all exclaimed in amazement, some thinking that it was an ominous and strange omen. He then took the crab to Zhou Bochou's home in Jieyang City. Zhou was surprised by its strangeness and presented it to County Magistrate Mao Qi. As the story spread, it caused a sensation throughout Jieyang City. Zhou Bochou, because the number of people seeking to see it was so great, had his threshold worn through. Therefore, he displayed the crab in the nursery of the Shuangfeng Temple, charging each viewer ten copper coins. In the ten days that it was exhibited in Jieyang, he obtained more than one hundred thousand copper coins, taking one-tenth for the crab owner, He Daxu, and allocating the remainder to the nursery for charitable purposes. The Shantou Shantou Daily sent someone to Jieyang to view it and wrote a detailed account. People in Chaoshan who heard about it were amazed and initially did not believe it. On August 4th, He took the strange crab to Shantou, carrying the pot through the city. Passersby flocked to see it, and the road was blocked. On the 5th, the Shantou authorities heard about it and initially sent the crab to the 5th District Office. All the police officers were able to admire the beauty. In the afternoon, the crab was sent to the Public Security Bureau. By this time, it had caused a stir throughout Shantou City. The officials discussed with the crab owner and decided to display the crab at the Qilu Poor People's Handicraft Factory, charging a dime per ticket, with four-tenths going to the Poor People's Institute, four-tenths going to the Jieyang Nursery, and two-tenths going to the crab owner. The exhibition was scheduled to run from the 6th to the 10th. The Poor People's Factory therefore put up street posters advertising the strange crab. The Shantou newspapers also published brief accounts. If this crab does not die, it will surely meet with famous scholars in the provinces, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing in the future (August 6th).</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Launches a Major Campaign to Suppress Russian Bandits</h3>
<p>Two Groups of Russian Bandits Invade the Interior of Heilongjiang</p>
<p>The Heilongjiang Authorities Dispatch the 15th Brigade to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Harbin correspondence: The White Russian bandit Zhai Kuofu, who was causing trouble in Sanhe Town in the Shivei County of Heilongjiang Province, attacked the Hake Station on the Haman Railway in mid-June in an attempt to rob a passenger train. It was repelled by the 15th Brigade and fled to the Solun area of Inner Mongolia, inciting the Oroqen and Solun Mongols to gather more than 2,000 people. They again advanced towards the Haman Line, aiming to seize the Boketu Station and cut off transportation. As a result, all stations along the line above Boketu began to implement temporary martial law on the 30th of last month. The First Cavalry Brigade of the Heilongjiang Army, led by Zhang Dianjiu, concentrated its forces from the Ang'angxi and Anda stations to Boketu to prevent the bandits from invading the interior. In this comeback, in addition to Zhai Kuofu, a new White Russian, Beshguofu, was appointed as the commander of the cavalry team. Most of the Solun Mongols who joined were cavalrymen, led by Beshguofu. The Oroqen people were originally a hunting people in Inner Mongolia. Last year, due to mountain floods and the escape of wild animals, they could not maintain their livelihoods by hunting. The Oroqen Chief presented a petition to the Heilongjiang authorities for relief, but the authorities had no thorough solution. The tribe became increasingly impoverished and was incited by Zhai Kuofu. Although the firearms they use are mostly old-fashioned, they are brave and skilled in shooting. Zhai Kuofu's forces have grown stronger with the addition of this tribe, so the western front has recently been in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another group of Russian bandits who, in the spring of this year, successively captured the three cities of Huma, Shivei, and Mohe and established pseudo-organizations. The number of people is about four to five thousand. Their guns, ammunition, and gunpowder are all supplied by the Soviet Union. A month ago, the Ba Ying'e Brigade stationed in Heihe by Heilongjiang Province was dispatched to suppress them. After two weeks, the bandits were driven back into Russian territory. When the Ba Brigade returned in late July, the bandits, after replenishing their supplies in Russia, re-entered the border from Shivei, crossing Sanhe Town and Shudu County to attack the Balimu Station on the Haman Railway. On the evening of July 29th, the vanguard of the bandits invaded the Ba Station. There were not many troops stationed there, and they were caught off guard in the middle of the night, resulting in the death of 12 soldiers and 4 railway employees from stray bullets. Before dawn on the 30th, the 43rd Regiment was dispatched from Manzhouli to rescue them, and they were able to repel the bandits at dawn. However, although the bandits retreated, they were still lurking near Shudu, trying to take the opportunity to invade. Wan Fulin, the chairman of Heilongjiang Province, feared that the banditry would expand, so he convened a military meeting in the provincial capital on the first of this month, attended by dozens of senior officers from all over the province. It was decided that the 15th Brigade of Su Bingwen's department would be fully responsible for the search and suppression. Su returned to Hailar from the province on the 4th of this month and has already ordered his troops to concentrate in Hailar, and they will be mobilized in about a week or so (5th).</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>The Communist Bandits on the Jidun Line Have Been Eliminated</h3>
<p>The YanHun Telegraph Has Been Restored</p>
<p>The Provincial Capital's Preparedness Has Been Increased</p>
<p>Jilin correspondence: The communist bandits along the Jidun line have been eliminated after the provincial capital dispatched troops to assist in the suppression, and they have fled without a trace. The military police here are still on alert and searching to prevent them from rising again. Jihai's defenses are tighter, so no incidents have occurred. The Japanese Consulate General in Jilin is paying close attention to this case and has been inquiring about the situation at the provincial government. However, these bandits are only carrying out riots in the name of communists and have no ideology to speak of. According to Dunhua, the news of the August 1st communist bandit riot was discovered by four important prisoners in the prison, who planned to break out of prison and dug out stones from the prison wall. The jailers noticed this and immediately captured the four prisoners and reported it to the county magistrate, who telegraphed the provincial government. They were ordered to be executed, so they were tied up and shot outside the west gate on the 3rd and displayed to the public. On the same day, the first passenger train from Jidun escorted two groups of important prisoners to Dunhua. One was three Chinese people and six barrels of foreign oil, who were captured at a bridge 87 kilometers from Xiaogujia Lafa. They were escorted by the army to the regimental headquarters in the city. The other was two Koreans with a foreign cannon, who were captured in Huangnihe. They were handed over to the Dunhua Fourth Police Section, and after the section recorded their confessions, they were transferred to the regimental headquarters in the city. According to the Chinese prisoners, they burned a large bridge and received an official reward of 60,000 strings of cash, and burned a small bridge and received an official reward of 50,000 strings of cash. The three of them planned to burn two wooden bridges and had already received an official reward of 60,000 strings of cash. There was also a Li Changchun, who was previously a doctor at the Dunhua Hospital in Beiguan of Duncheng and an important person in the party. People in the hospital were visited by party members all day long. A naturalized Korean, Park Guanhai, noticed this and reported it in the spring, and he drove away the people in the hospital, searched it thoroughly, and obtained a large bundle of letters and receipts from the party members. He sent them to the county government, which sealed off the hospital. Li Changchun fled when he heard the news. He secretly returned in early July to serve as a doctor at the Dunhua and Minsheng hospitals. One day, when the communist bandit incident occurred, he hid again. On the 3rd, he rode a horse to the street and was intercepted by military police at the intersection. Also, Kang Fuda, a doctor at Bo'ai Hospital, was also an important person in the party. After the incident occurred, he was escorted by Mantetsu personnel and left Dunhua with his family on the early train to Jidun on the 4th, thus escaping scot-free. The weapons used by the communist bandits this time, in addition to hand grenades and small guns, were all foreign cannons, wooden sticks, shovels, hoes, etc. The most peculiar thing was that they actually used foreign cannons filled with chili powder. However, when the gunshot was heard, a red light flashed in the face, causing people to cough uncontrollably. Many people were confused, which was truly unheard of. On July 31st, the provincial authorities received a telegram from Shenyang saying that the communist bandits had changed their plan to disrupt the Fifth-One celebration and had decided to start the incident on August 1st, and immediately telegraphed various places to take precautions. However, it was too late, and the Dunhua telephone line had been cut. Even if it was forwarded from other places, the incident had already occurred. Fortunately, the party's equipment was not sophisticated and did not cause a major disaster. The provincial capital also had frequent alarms, but nothing happened. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday evening, a bandit kidnapping suddenly occurred in the fifth district outside the west gate, and they engaged in a fierce battle with the police near the branch prison, injuring three officers and police. The bandits then fled, and rumors spread for a time. Subsequently, the Border Guard dispatched troops to cooperate with the police in a strict search and sent cavalry to pursue them overnight. The authorities, fearing that the defense would not allow any slackness at this time of frequent alarms, specifically ordered that the streets be closed at 10:00 p.m. every night, and that plainclothes military and military uniforms be spread throughout the city, and the police and military were on guard even more than before. The local area has been as peaceful as usual (August 6th).</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Cracks Down on Disturbances by Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that there are about 3,000 wounded soldiers stationed in Hangzhou, and there have been occasional incidents of disturbances that have a considerable impact on local public order. To prevent such incidents from occurring, it specifically convened a discussion meeting yesterday to crack down on disturbances by wounded soldiers. Attendees included Secretary-General Liu Shixin, Security Director Zhu Enming, Public Security Bureau Director Yan Youfu, Hangzhou Mayor Cai Zengji, General Hospital Director Jin Songpan, Army Hospital Director Sun Xushang, Representative of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and Hangzhou Station Manager Shen Hui, and Police Chief of the Second Section of the Railway Bureau, Zhuang Shouhua, etc. Presided over by Liu Shixin, the meeting resulted in the following decisions: 1. Wounded soldiers leaving the hospital are only allowed to have two leave passes for every 100 people. For the entire hospital of 3,000 wounded soldiers, only 60 people are allowed to leave. 2. Wounded soldiers who leave without permission, regardless of whether they cause disturbances in the city or not, should be detained by the military and police and sent back to the hospital for punishment. 3. The Railway Bureau will add a third-class carriage as a special train for wounded soldiers. They will not be allowed to sit in other passenger cars or first- and second-class seats. If they violate this regulation deliberately, the railway police and military police should cooperate to stop them. 4. Wounded soldiers who possess firearms should immediately hand them in for a price. 5. The Security Office will send a company of soldiers to depart at 12 noon, 4 p.m., and 6 p.m. every day when the train arrives at the stations in Qiaocheng, etc., to be responsible for cracking down on wounded soldiers. 6. The Public Security Bureau's joint inspection team of police and military police should assist in cracking down on disturbances by wounded soldiers at any time and in any place within the city. 7. The hospital will send an adjutant to be stationed at the Provincial Public Security Bureau to be responsible for handling matters related to cracking down on wounded soldiers. 8. The above cases will be notified by the Secretariat of the Provincial Government to all relevant agencies for strict implementation.</p>

<h3>Bandit Communists Fleeing into Our Territory</h3>
<p>Following the bandit communist riots in Nanhui's Nicheng, this county, being a short distance away, was the first to be affected. Therefore, the county authorities immediately dispatched Gan Zhenzhong, the second squad leader of the county police stationed in Fengcheng, to Duzaizi. According to a report from the fourth branch of the Public Security Bureau there, it was confirmed that bandit communists had indeed fled into our territory in the past two days, and the area around Touyalou on the border between Nan and Feng was even more rampant. Nearby Ping'an and Yanzuo were also reportedly destroyed. Simultaneously, salt police apprehended five suspected criminals in the area and sent them to the county. Currently, the two county heads, in order to implement suppression, have specially dispatched teams today to pursue and attack separately, while all districts have implemented martial law to prevent any infiltration.</p>
<h3>Qi Jin Security Guards Surrounded and Captured Bandits</h3>
<p>Since being robbed last year, Qixian Bridge has organized a security team to increase its strength. Recently, due to the discovery of threatening letters, patrols have been particularly strict. Last night, more than 20 bandits suddenly came to the Yu Maojia neighborhood near the area, fighting and robbing. Upon hearing the news, the security team rushed to the rescue, clashing on the spot and capturing three bandits. At the same time, the Jinhui Bridge security team, upon receiving the news, was also led by the head, Sun Baoyi, to encircle and suppress the bandits. They intercepted two suspects near Zhagang, close to the border between Feng and Nan. After interrogation, their confessions were accurate. All were sent to the county this afternoon for interrogation.</p>
<p>Nanhui</p>
<h3>Watermelon Bloodshed Case</h3>
<p>Li Bingyu, the 28-year-old only son of Li Yantang of Xilijiazhai, Zhongxinhe Town, Nanhui County, Pudong, was beaten to death by Wang Amao and others from a neighboring village on the 25th of last month for stealing watermelons. There have been lingering repercussions. The details of the inquiry are as follows: Li Bingyu made a living catching crabs and was a good swimmer. When the wind and waves were calm, he could cross the Huangpu River in his clothes. At about 1:00 PM that day, he went out with his neighbor Gu Shuichuan to catch crabs, obtaining a large basket. He sold it to Ashun Fish Shop in Sanlintang Town and returned fully loaded. It was a hot and sunny day, and he was very thirsty. As he passed Jianghe's house, he saw a field of watermelons. He picked one to eat and quench his thirst. Just as he was bending down to pick another, he was spotted by Wang Amao, the owner of the watermelon field, who had been deeply resentful because he had been losing watermelons recently, and had been waiting for this for days. At that time, Wang Amao was furious and immediately gathered his neighbors, holding shoulder poles and harpoons, and rushed to the north end of Zhujiashiqiao Bridge. They suddenly and violently attacked Li Bingyu. Fortunately, Zhang Shuichuan saw figures coming and knew that disaster was imminent. He immediately ran away and crossed three rivers, hiding in Gange's tomb. He dared to escape home only in the evening and reported what had happened to Li Yantang. The family was shocked and hired people to search everywhere, but to no avail. On the morning of the 26th, Yantang reported to the village head, Wang Dehua, who claimed ignorance and did not help. So he returned home and asked his neighbors to help search. At 3:00 PM, a body was found in Wangjiatan Bay. The Zhongxinhe Town Public Security Bureau sent Patrol Chief Zu Jian to inspect the scene. According to Li Yantang, his son Bingyu was beaten to death by Wang Amao and others from village 22 because of a conflict over picking watermelons. He requested that the murderers be arrested and sent to the bureau for strict handling. Patrol Chief Tang, considering the public's rumors, all stated that the murderer was indeed Wang Amao, so he immediately arrested him and sent him to the Nanhui County Government, and requested that a coroner be dispatched to examine the body as soon as possible so that it could be collected. Li Yantang, having witnessed the murder of his own son, reported the previous situation as a criminal case to the county government and requested an examination. County Magistrate Tao Mu approved the request on the 28th and appointed Kang Yisheng, the head of the second branch of the Zhoupu Public Security Bureau, along with Coroner Sheng Ji and more than a dozen bailiffs, to the scene for the examination. The examination results were that the bridge of the nose was broken, the mouth and eyes were blurred, the hands and feet were slightly wrinkled, the chest was purplish-red, and there were wounds on the top of the head and above the anus. Previously, the village head Wang Dehua had reported that the corpse had fallen into the river and died while being chased, which was obviously vague, so Director Kang reprimanded him and examined the corpse closely, showing it to the village head Wang. Wang remained silent. Afterwards, the head of the village security team, Pang Xueqiao, and the village head Gu Huibo, because the village head's son was also suspected of being an accomplice, dared to obscure the report and secretly requested that Coroner Sheng issue a private judgment, which was unacceptable. They re-submitted the case to Nanhui County, and the county commissioned an adjudicator (on the 7th of the month) to transport the coffin to Nanhui County. The county then commissioned Adjudicator Cheng and Wang Dao, the director of the public hospital, to re-examine the body at 2:00 PM. The examination revealed that the head was twisted, the mouth and eyes were wide open, the flesh was red and yellow, the throat was blue-black, the chest was not rotten and had no maggots, and was red with a purplish-black tint. There was a hole in the right side of the waist, and the end of the second rib was protruding. The hands and feet were also not rotten. However, due to the urgency of time, the cause of death was not announced. Yesterday, the town head, Pang Zhongyuan, and the village head, Yan Huibo, believed that the county government was delaying the decision on this homicide case and forcing the doctor to issue a false certificate, which was inappropriate. The arrested murderer, Wang Amao, has been detained in prison but has not been interrogated. Therefore, they have submitted another report requesting a speedy resolution. However, County Magistrate Tao of the county has been commissioned by the provincial government to take over the vacant position of county magistrate of Taicang. Kong Rong has been appointed to replace him and took office yesterday, so the dispute in this case may be further delayed.</p>

<h3>Orders to Reduce Agency Expenses</h3>
<p>The county government received instructions from the provincial government yesterday stating that due to the emptiness of the national treasury and the urgency of military use, all agency expenses except for military salaries and educational expenses will be reduced by 50% starting this month. Upon hearing this news, the staff of various agencies were greatly alarmed. County Magistrate Chen gathered the heads of various agencies yesterday to discuss measures. The police chief was reprimanded for the fact that Gu Tingxiang, the first squad leader of the police team stationed in Qianmingtang, in the southwest township, and Patrol Chief Wang Jinsheng were covering up gambling dens, which led to the rampant rise of gambling in the town. Local people reported them to the county. After investigation, it was confirmed that Wang Jinsheng was immediately dismissed with military sticks, and Gu Tingxiang was reported to the county government for review. The team was transferred to another location, and the defense of the town was taken over by the fifth squad of the third team stationed in Chengqiao, in the eastern township. However, residents of Chengqiao claim that the team leader and police officers are addicted to opium and have many bad habits in Chengqiao.</p>
<h3>Undutiful Son Beats Father, Sent to County</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhongbin, a farmer from Liujing Township, District 8 of the county, is over 50 years old and very honest. His son, Atao, is 25 years old and extremely violent, often beating and insulting his father. Yesterday (the 11th) morning, because of a minor family matter that slightly displeased him, he used an iron object to pierce a hole in Zhongbin's head, and blood flowed non-stop. Atao, seeing that he had caused trouble, was about to escape when he was intercepted by neighbors and reported to the security team. The district head interrogated him, and he confessed to beating his father without denying it. In the afternoon, he was sent to the county government for legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Sequel to the Case of the Adulterous Wife Poisoning Her Husband</h3>
<p>Shen Ajin, a farmer from Xinqiao Village, District 8, was almost poisoned to death last month by his wife, Zhou, who mixed mercury into his noodles. He noticed and turned Zhou and her lover, Zhang A泉, over to the security team, who sent them to the county government for punishment. Currently, the mercury that Ajin ingested has not been vomited out, and his abdomen is swollen like a drum. He cannot eat and is in critical condition.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Indictment of Suspected Reactionaries</h3>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau arrested four suspected reactionaries last month, Ms. Yang Zhongxian and male teachers Ge Naibin, Zhang Yiming, and Cai Zhihua, and transferred them to the High Court for investigation. After investigation by prosecutors Jin Henian, Sun Xihang, and Zhu Jun, respectively, all have been indicted and scheduled for trial.</p>
<h3>Provincial Order to Rescue Hostages Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>On the morning of last month 21, Zhu Xiangbao, a grass-cutting farmer in Baihu, Wujiang County, and his children, along with Chen Yuzhen and Chen Zhenfang, were kidnapped by lake bandits while cutting grass. Their whereabouts are unknown. Ding Shou, the eighth district chief of the area, immediately telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that they order the search and rescue of the hostages. After receiving the telegram, the Department of Civil Affairs issued an order to Gong, the district chief of the third district of the Water Public Security, yesterday (the 12th), to solve the case within a time limit.</p>
<h3>Continued Implementation of Price Stabilization Rice Sales for One Month</h3>
<p>The city and district price stabilization rice bureaus have reported that the rice sold at stabilized prices is insufficient and have requested the Warehouse Committee to forward the report to the county government for review. Yesterday (the 12th), County Magistrate Huang specially convened administrative committee members from various districts, Warehouse Committee administrators, and local figures at the county government to discuss and decide: (1) To continue the tenth phase, totaling one month. The method is to continue subsidizing three yuan per stone, exchanging for money tickets, and purchasing rice from rice shops with the tickets, not for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Troops Departing, Requesting the Dispatch of Military Police</h3>
<p>The garrison brigade stationed in Suzhou has been ordered to depart and is scheduled to leave Suzhou on the 14th. Local figures here believe that as the garrison brigade departs, the Second Military Police Regiment must also be sent to Changzhou. With no troops stationed in Suzhou, the local security, although jointly responsible by the police and the merchant corps, may be insufficient to manage if there are emergencies, given the numerous bandits in the four townships. Yesterday, Zhang Yiao and Pan Shengnian jointly telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, requesting that 500 military police be dispatched to Suzhou to maintain security, and to find ways to expand the merchant corps to strengthen its forces.</p>

<h3>Telegram Urging Chairman Wang to Return to Yangzhou</h3>

However, at about 10:00 PM on the 9th, a theatrical incident occurred in which guest laborers joined forces to seize the guns of the merchant corps, and the merchant corps opened fire in self-defense. Wang, believing the matter to be difficult to handle, took his family to Shanghai a day earlier. Yesterday (the 10th), shops, fearing being looted by bandits, were all closed, and the city gates were also tightly closed. Only the Fuyun Gate was opened in the evening. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, after Brigade Commander Liu Hanzhen took responsibility for the city's security, all the city gates began to open. It was also heard that the elders, believing the local market to be in critical condition, had telegraphed Shanghai urging Wang to return to enable all merchants and residents of the city to have someone to rely on.

Fengying's cries for help alerted the innkeeper, who turned him over to the local Public Security Bureau and sent him to the county. The chief prosecutor of the procuratorate investigated and confirmed the facts and prosecuted Qin Baonian. Wang's family is far away in Taixian, and she has no acquaintances to vouch for her, so a letter was sent to the Women's Relief Association to temporarily keep her in foster care until her family is notified and takes her away.</p>
<h3>Two Standing Committee Members Go to the Province to Petition</h3>
<p>Tang Shou, a standing committee member of the Jiangdu County Party Affairs Rectification Committee, and Zhu Zhusun, a standing committee member of the County Chamber of Commerce, learned from the newspaper that the 32nd Rear Hospital in Zhenjiang was to be moved to Yangzhou immediately. The two standing committee members, representing the merchants and residents of the county, rushed to the province this morning (the 11th) to petition and present all the difficulties facing the area. They said that it was already difficult to accommodate the 27th Rear Hospital in Yangzhou, and if the 32nd Hospital were to be moved to Yangzhou again, the area within the city of Jiangyi would be too small, making it even more difficult for the area to cope. They sincerely requested that the decision be reversed. It was reported that Chairman Ye received them and promised to consider the matter carefully.</p>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Mutiny of the Anti-Smuggling Water Police in Xiba</h3>
<p>Regarding the mutiny of the First Team of the Anti-Smuggling Water Police in Huaibei, Xiba, Huaiyin, its situation has been briefly seen in this newspaper. We will now provide more details based on the news received today (the 9th) from various sources. Before the mutiny, the soldiers had received a telegram from Hu, the concurrently anti-smuggling director of Banpu, on the 27th of last month, ordering the first squadron to open a company to Xinan Town. However, due to various rumors, they refused to go to Lianshui. At the time, a certain squadron leader of the Jiamao Dock Team did not allow them to stay, causing the soldiers of each team to be dissatisfied and demand back pay from a certain squadron leader, speaking disrespectfully. A certain squadron leader was afraid and fell into the water. At the same time, a police dog raised by a certain department also threw itself into the salt river for rescue, and its whereabouts are unknown. Another division commander, A, secretly returned to Xiba and reported to Commander Su that the soldiers of the team, because the team leader had fallen into the water and disappeared and the division commanders had fled, returned to Xiba by the original ship on the 30th of the same month and did not garrison in the old location. As a result, one part garrisoned in the nunnery, one part garrisoned in the Guandi Temple, one part garrisoned in the Qianfu Inn, and the headquarters of the brigade garrisoned at the railway head, mutually supporting each other to prevent the actions of superior officials. Commander Su also had no choice but to promise to pay the old arrears of four months' military pay in the hope of gradually getting them to comply. However, after the payment of the arrears, dozens of bandits in white clothes suddenly appeared at dusk on the 7th, each with short guns in their sleeves, and enticed the water police stationed in the nunnery to rebel. At that moment, gunshots rang out suddenly, and the water police stationed at the Guandi Temple and the headquarters of the brigade also successively mutinied. At that time, Commander Su was taking a bath in the room when he heard that his guard, Feng, had been shot down for snatching a gun from the mutineers. He fought to escape from the window, but his whereabouts are still unknown. Thereupon, the mutineers turned their hat brims backward (whether it was a secret mark is unknown) and went to Hongjie Er's sauce garden and Xu's grocery store next to the Qianfu Inn to loot. There were also those who dragged laborers to carry their luggage, and order was in great chaos. Fortunately, Wu, the director of the third branch of the Public Security, Ge Zhenqing, the captain of the patrol team, and Yin Congxin, the captain of the salt transport escort team, led their subordinates to defend, and Wang Yueming's division commander of the brigade refused to echo. The mutineers did not dare to stay long and fled across the Yiwu ferry across the north bank of the Salt River. It was a great looting, and it was heard that by the afternoon of the 8th, more than 100 men and women had been looted. The first to be disturbed was Zhang Village near Yuanji, and from there straight to the northwest Langshi Town and Sankeshu Ji were all looted.</p>
<p>Wang Jinshan, the owner of the Sankeshu Collection, was also shot dead by the mutineers, but the</p>
<p>Yugou Town got the news earlier. By 3:00 AM on the morning of the 8th, preparations had been made, and the mutineers did not dare to attack lightly. On the afternoon of the 8th, the Siyang County Government telegraphed the Huaiyin County Government, saying that the mutineers had arrived at Jiangji, Siyang, and the pursuing officers and soldiers also rushed to the collection to suppress them. What the results were is unknown. However, the merchants and residents of Xiba believed that with the various troops trailing the mutineers, no one was responsible for local defense. It was heard that they had jointly telegraphed Hu, the concurrently anti-smuggling director of Banpu, to publicly elect Wang Yueming, the non-mutinying division commander, to temporarily maintain defense to avoid other bandits taking advantage of the situation. After this incident in Xiba, rumors were inevitable, and those who were slightly wealthy had already moved to the county seat in the past two days, as seen yesterday and today, in order to seek temporary peace.</p>

<h3>First Day of the International University Games</h3>
<p>Only the shot put final took place丨Germany, England, France, America, and Italy performed well</p>
<p>(Telegraph from Darmstadt, Germany) The fourth International University Games opened in Darmstadt, Germany, on the morning of August 7. There were a total of more than 2,000 athletes from 27 countries participating, an unprecedented event in international sports. After the opening ceremony, athletes from various countries immediately engaged in fierce competition. The best performers were Germany, Japan, England, France, the United States, and Italy.

<p>(2) 100m Preliminary</p>
<p>The 100m preliminary was one of the most intense scenes of the day. The competition was divided into two groups. Japanese athlete Yoshioka, who once held the Far East 100m hegemony, struggled to win third place in the first group. Others, such as Sa Yu Ben and Oshima, were also in the second group, but all were eliminated. The qualifiers for the two groups are as follows:</p>
<p>First Group: (1) Shalzhi (Germany) (2) Gulisha (Australia) (3) Yoshioka (Japan) Second Group: (1) Lajiamubi (Hungary) (2) Ganixi (Germany) (3) Yan Ludola (Germany)</p>

<p>The German team won first place and the Japanese team won second place with a score of 43.2 seconds. The Japanese team's score was very good, almost reaching the finish line at the same time as Germany. There will definitely be a spectacular race in the final. The Japanese team consists of Sazaki, Oshima, Nakajima, and Yoshioka. Because the talent is average, the performance is strong. The following teams qualified for the 400m relay preliminary: Germany, Japan, Czech Republic, France, Sluo Agia, Hungary, Italy.</p>
<p>(4) High Hurdles Preliminary</p>
<p>Divided into two groups of competitions, Japanese athletes Iwanaga and Fujita both showed great skill. Iwanaga won first place in the first group and Fujita won first place in the second group. Japan has a good chance in the final.</p>
<p>(5) 400m Preliminary</p>
<p>The much-anticipated Japanese star Nakajima abandoned this item because he put all his efforts into the 400m relay. Japan's Nishikawa was eliminated due to poor results.</p>
<p>Although Japan did not participate in the preliminary of the Olympic relay held that day, it was allowed to join the final. Finland's performance in this session was quite poor. The schedule for the second day is as follows: high hurdles final, 100m final, Olympic relay final, long jump final, 400m relay final, and pentathlon.</p>

<p>Important News: Ministry of Education Modifies Procedures for the Registration of Private Elementary Schools</p>
<p>According to a request from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, the Ministry of Education has approved the modification of procedures for the registration of private elementary schools, granting discretion for adjustments. From now on, municipal and county education bureaus will be the governing bodies for private junior elementary schools. In addition to instructing the Zhejiang Department of Education, orders have been sent to education departments in various provinces.</p>
<p>The case is based on a submission from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, citing a resolution from the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Education Directors' Conference last year, requesting a modification of the registration procedures for private elementary schools. Now, based on a request from the Qu County government, a modification of the establishment procedures for private elementary schools is proposed. Can this be handled with discretion? Copied together with the original establishment, following the Ministry-promulgated regulations for private schools, the procedures are divided into: (1) the board of directors submits a request for approval of establishment; (2) the board of directors submits a request for registration within one month of approval of establishment; (3) the board of directors may submit a request for approval of school establishment after registration; (4) the school reports commencement within six months of approval of establishment; (5) a request for registration is submitted one year after commencement. In areas with convenient transportation and document exchange, without significant time consumption, a private elementary school can be established and commence operations within three months if undertaken actively, without requiring much time. As for the performance after commencement, it should be reported for registration after a considerable period. During the period of political tutelage, compulsory education needs to be promoted, and rural schools need to be actively expanded. However, the establishment of an elementary school is deeply and significantly related to the children of a village. The initial preparations must be carried out cautiously. The request from the Qu County government to modify the establishment procedures for private elementary schools should not be considered. As for the Department's claim that the Department of Education is the governing body for private elementary schools, and all registration procedures must be reported for approval by the municipal and county governments, seeming slow, the Ministry, in order to consider the facts and promote compulsory education, approves discretionary modifications. From now on, municipal and county education bureaus will be the governing bodies for private elementary schools. All establishment procedures should still follow the Ministry-promulgated regulations for private schools, and the report should be submitted through the municipal and county education bureaus to the Department of Education for record. Private complete elementary schools will still be governed by the Department of Education. In addition to issuing instructions and distributing them, an order is issued for compliance and transmission to subordinates for unified compliance.</p>

<p>The World-Shaking Little Lindbergh  Zhang Jiping</p>
<p>After American aviator Colonel Lindbergh successfully flew across the Atlantic Ocean, the enthusiastic welcome he received in his own country and the congratulations from all over the world are still fresh in our minds. Unexpectedly, after his son was born, he also received an enthusiastic welcome from the world, no less than that of his father. The name "Little Lindbergh" was known far and wide just hours after he was born. The extent of its dissemination is greater than the fame that ordinary people can achieve in a lifetime. When he was born, various New York newspapers published special editions with large headlines to make this announcement. Newspapers in dozens of countries made similar announcements. Heads of state such as presidents and kings, as well as important figures in the aviation world, sent telegrams to the Lindbergh couple to congratulate them. What's especially strange is that street vendors, seeing the profit to be made, printed a type of postcard several days before the birth, which read, "Congratulations to the Lindberghs on the birth of Little Lindbergh," for friends and enthusiasts to use. Since Lindbergh was the world's most famous aviator and had won glory for his country, Americans eagerly purchased these postcards to send as a show of affection. As a result, these vendors made countless profits and can be said to be good at speculation. What's even more interesting is that this type of postcard was marked with the note, "Please do not mail before the birth to avoid embarrassment," which shows that these vendors were cautious in their pursuit of profit, which is better than the vendors in our country. Furthermore, just a few hours after Little Lindbergh was born, a poet set this event to song to show praise and broadcast the song globally via radio. There are even more extreme examples than this. The day after Little Lindbergh was born, factories that manufactured children's toys competed to send their products as gifts, such as clothes and strollers. Their intention was to get the Lindbergh couple to praise their products so they could use this as advertising. Not only this, but a well-known businessman in New York manufactured an exquisite sports car suitable for infants and transported it to the Lindberghs' residence, determined to give it to Little Lindbergh to use. After the Lindberghs politely declined, saying that they already had such a refined sports car, the businessman left with the car. Four days after Little Lindbergh was born, another song of praise appeared. The cover of the sheet music featured a red airplane with an infant sitting inside. Above it was a stork pulling the airplane, implying a double flight. The main idea was as follows: "Little Lindbergh, the world welcomes you. Little Lindbergh, the world is so proud of you. Your eyes are as beautiful as your mother's. Will you fly into the sky like your father? When your father takes you into the sky to shine with the bright moon, your mother will be beside you, holding you and softly singing a lullaby. Your joy is like your mother's, and you are as welcomed as your father. Little Lindbergh, we are very proud of you."</p>
<p>Before Little Lindbergh was born, general comic news was running out of material due to the hot summer. After this event was disclosed in the newspapers, they used it as unparalleled material, overindulging in their comic drawing addiction without feeling bored. Newspapers were extremely concerned about Little Lindbergh's daily life, with suggestions to create a non-stop rocking cradle and instructions to avoid the flashing of photographers' lights. All of this showed their care. Little Lindbergh is truly the pride of heaven. In addition, an astrologer predicted that Little Lindbergh would live to be over seventy years old and that he would have three wives, meaning he would have to marry three times. It was also pointed out that Little Lindbergh's kidneys and stomach would not be healthy and would need to be taken care of. This person's talent for following trends is no less than that of the people mentioned above. First, to express concern; second, to promote his business; and third, to gain the favor of the Lindbergh couple and the amusement of the world (referring to the three marriages). It is truly a case of achieving several good things with one action.</p>
<p>Notes from the Ballpark  Shen Zhenchao</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lin Baohua, Zheng Zhaojia, Qiu Feihai, and Jiang Daozhang played a public doubles tennis championship match at the Zhonghua Tennis Court. Lin, Qiu, and Wang are all national tennis players, while Zheng is a rising star. The meeting of these four heroes was a rare event, attracting a large crowd and a bustling scene.</p>
<p>Who Dares to Bet? The doubles pairing of Lin and Zheng against Qiu and Wang was evenly matched, and the outcome could not be predicted before the match. Some said the Lin team would win because they were well-matched, while others said the Qiu team would win because Jiang was a better supporting player than Zheng. Because the friends in the audience wanted to emulate Westerners and predict the outcome before the game, they bet against each other. However, since the match was so evenly matched, there was no confidence in the outcome, and no one dared to accept the bet.</p>
<p>Motherly and Sisterly Concern. Every time Lin has a match, his mother and sisters must come to watch. This is not only to enjoy the tennis skills but also because the loving mother and younger sisters are always concerned about the outcome for their beloved son and older brother. Lin won the championship yesterday, so his mother and sisters must be very happy.</p>
<p>A Barrage of Projectiles. The four players' skills were amazing. The way they hit the ball was as fast as arrows and as swift as hawks. The sound of the ball hitting the racket was like "bang, bang." Lin's serve was even known as the "cannonball serve," so being at the tennis court was like being on a battlefield, with the constant sound of cannonballs.</p>
<p>The Young Are to Be Feared. Qiu and Jiang are both experienced veterans and are older than Lin and Zheng. Zheng, on the other hand, is a handsome young man who is said to be only nineteen years old. Initially, Qiu and Jiang won two sets, gaining the advantage. Unfortunately, their energy was not enough, and they gradually showed signs of decline, losing again and again, and were finally defeated. Looking back at Lin and Zheng, they were full of vigor and became more courageous as they fought. It is said that the young are to be feared.</p>
<p>Words of Wisdom from the Coach. Zheng learned tennis from Lin and made great progress, which was widely praised. The reason for his victory was said to be his faithful adherence to the coach's instructions. After each game, Lin would whisper something to Zheng, and Zheng would always listen attentively, indicating the strategy. In the fifth game yesterday, Zheng powerfully smashed the ball with his racket, and Qiu and Jiang couldn't react in time, so they lost the game. Lin jumped up and cheered, showing his joy.</p>
<p>The Spectators Were Anxious. Qiu and Jiang won the first two sets, and everyone thought they were going to win. Who knew that victory is not always constant, and Lin and Zheng came from behind. The spectators were anxious for Qiu and Jiang, hoping they would win. When they saw them gain a point in the decisive fifth set, they were happy, but when they saw them lose a point, they were worried. The rising and falling of the felt ball made their hearts race with anxiety.</p>
<p>Sisterly Talents. Yesterday, the spectators were like clouds, with elegant women and famous people, and the scene was filled with beautiful clothes and shadows. The tennis sisters, Li Xinghua and the Peony sisters, also gracefully came to watch the tennis skills.</p>
<p>Butterflies Filled the Sky. After Lin and Zheng won, the spectators cheered, and the association presented them with silver cups as a reward. At this time, over a thousand spectators threw seat cushions into the air, fluttering like butterflies. It was quite a sight.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes on Drug Names  Run</p>
<p>In the business world, the naming of all kinds of goods is extremely important. A good name is easy to spread by word of mouth and is also easy to promote sales. If the words are awkward and difficult to remember, then even if the goods are good, sales will definitely be affected. Therefore, entrepreneurs must pay attention to the naming of their products. Leaving other things aside, even when it comes to medicines, the words must be simple and easy to remember. It is often seen that the translated names of Western medicines are all strangely worded and difficult to pronounce. There are often people who have already arrived at the pharmacy but stammer and cannot say the name of the medicine they want to buy. Is this not a joke? Even new medicines made by Chinese people themselves often fail to impress people's minds because the naming is not good, and it is impossible for them to circulate throughout the country. How can this be achieved? At the end of last month, I came to Shanghai on business and passed by Nanjing Road. I happened to see a glass piece on the front eaves of a public bus with the three characters "Bu Er Duo" (補爾多) hooked together in goose yellow. At a glance, I knew it was the name of a tonic medicine, and the words were simple, easy to read, and easy to remember. I sighed at the excellence of the naming, but I didn't know which pharmacy produced it. Then I read the news in the Shen Bao and learned that it was a new medicine produced by the Jiu Fu Company, using the squalene extracted from cod liver oil as the main ingredient, divided into pure and mixed types, with many tonic effects. The so-called "Bu Er Duo" (補爾多) is probably this meaning.</p>
<p>A Word About Protecting Records  Ye</p>
<p>I have a passion for the erhu and have been studying it for three years. Although I haven't reached the bottom of it, I have gained half of my experience from teachers and friends, and the other half from records. However, records often have inconsistencies in the art of the sound engineer and the sound waves of the speaker, resulting in obvious flaws when playing the record. I have dozens of records stored specifically for studying the erhu, covering the essential pieces for learning Xipi, Erhuang, Bangzi, and Bozi. However, one thing is most unsatisfactory: often, the excellent performances of famous players and the excellent songs of famous singers are so deeply engraved on the record that the sound is too loud, and ordinary machines cannot move the stylus. The sound becomes fast and slow, causing the spirit of the original record to be completely lost. I have long regretted this and have not found a good solution for a long time. Then, the famous erhu player Ni Qiuping visited my residence. During a discussion about the erhu, he mentioned what he was doing. Ni said, "Why don't you try the Yang brand record player oil issued by the Safety Firm in this city? I guarantee you'll be satisfied." The next day, I hurried to the record player company to buy it and try it. Sure enough, the flow became natural, the color was like new, and the sound was completely restored to its original state! Therefore, I have described the outline for the reference of fellow enthusiasts (with gratitude).</p>
<p>A Large Number of Chinese Workers Returning Home from Japan  Ai Ai, from Japan</p>
<p>Existing Jobs Taken by Japanese Workers</p>
<p>Embassy Escorts Unemployed Chinese Workers Home</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese workers in Japan are scattered in places such as Nagoya, Yokohama, Oshima, Omori, and Chitada-cho. The exact number is unknown because in the past, there has been little detailed statistics and investigation from various parties. However, it is estimated that there are no fewer than 3,000 people. Most of them are from Wenzhou and Chuzhou in Zhejiang Province, followed by Chuzhou people. Except for a very small number of workers who are leather makers, carpenters, etc., 80-90% of them are coal lifting workers. This kind of work is strenuous and the wages are very low, which Japanese workers are usually unwilling or unable to do. Therefore, Chinese workers can take advantage of this opportunity that others abandon to survive. However, recently, due to the downturn in the Japanese economy, the number of unemployed Japanese workers has exceeded 1.5 million according to recent statistics. As a result, the hardest jobs that Chinese workers in Japan used to do have also been taken by Japanese workers, causing most of them to become unemployed and their lives to suddenly fall into desperation. Those who are better off can only eat a little porridge every day, and there are many who cannot get food for several days. The masses believe that it will be difficult to continue living like this, so they have asked the consulate and embassy to escort them back to their country. After the embassy negotiated with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and with the agreement of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, all the travel expenses for the Chinese workers to return to their country were calculated at half price, which was borne by the embassy and repaid afterwards. The first batch of 20 people returned to China on June 22nd. 60 people returned on the 25th, and 20 people returned on the 28th. 350 people returned on the 30th. In addition, there are a large number waiting for ships to return to China. However, recently there have been frequent discoveries of Chinese rogues colluding with Japanese ronin to specialize in luring Chinese workers and farmers to Japan in order to extort and profit from them. At this time, when the original Chinese workers in Japan are returning to their country one after another to make a living, there are still workers from China coming to the east. It was not until they arrived in Japan that they realized that it was too late to regret it. It is hoped that the Chinese people will pay attention to this to avoid future fools from being deceived.</p>
<p>Warmth in the Heart (253)  Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Who Unintentionally Plants Fortune and Gains a Diamond Ring? Only with This Predestined Relationship Does One Intentionally Sing a Golden Thread Song.</p>
<p>Helplessly, the gatekeeper still refused to open it. After a lot of commotion, he opened a small door on the big iron gate that was less than a foot long and eight inches wide, revealing a dark face to speak. This kind of small door is very popular in Shanghai nowadays. The doors of opium dens have this small door for exchanging money and buying cigarettes late at night. The doors of Chinese medicine stores have this small door for patients to redeem medicine late at night. The doors of wealthy people's Western-style houses have this small door to prevent villains from rushing in easily when the big door is opened. Even the gambling dens have this small door to prevent detectives from catching them. Zuo Shichen usually hadn't paid attention to the fact that the hospital also had this small door. However, even though the small door was open, it was of no use. The doctor couldn't crawl out of the small door, and Zuo Shichen couldn't crawl into the small door either. He still begged him, saying that there was a child with a serious illness at home, and asked him to inform the doctor. The person's intention was to ask the doctor to come and see him. The gatekeeper shook his head and said, "Everyone inside is asleep. Who can disturb them?" Zuo Shichen said, "You don't have to disturb anyone else. Just ask the doctor if he can come to see a seriously ill patient." The gatekeeper said, "It's useless. He doesn't go out after dark. Besides, there is a lot of plague outside now. The more serious the illness, the less he wants to see it. You should go to another place to find a doctor." It turned out that the hospitals opened by the churches in Shanghai had a kind of charitable nature. They don't charge for the consultation fee, but only collect a registration fee of one or two dimes. As for the cost of medicine, they charge according to the clothes and decorations of the person who comes. If you are dressed in rags, they charge less, maybe two or three dimes. If you are well-dressed, they immediately raise the price to seven or eight dimes. Therefore, people of middle and lower classes deliberately wear tattered clothes to see the doctor. However, because that kind of hospital is used to seeing poor people's diseases, it has developed an arrogant and condescending attitude. The patient feels that they have saved my life and don't even want my money. How great is the favor! Of course, I am grateful beyond words. And the people in the hospital also feel that these poor and sick people who have no way to appeal are all people who I have favored. They are used to hearing their words of gratitude, and unknowingly their arrogance increases. Perhaps the doctors only regard it as a profession, which is still good. However, the servants in the hospital, from the tea boy to the nurses, are all arrogant and domineering. They speak harshly to the patients and have fierce expressions. The patients' cries of misery are originally accustomed to the people in the hospital. Even if they die from the disease, it is also a common occurrence. Seeing that the patient is a little hopeless, they immediately move him to the morgue and let him wait to die. The hospital that Zuo Shichen is knocking on the door of now is also one of the so-called charitable hospitals. However, they are famous for seeing women and children. That female doctor is American and cannot be considered a pediatrician without ability.</p>

The October opening order was 7 pence 0625 from Xingye. Mitsui appeared at Dalian at 1 tael, 2 qian, 9 fen, 125, which was then absorbed by the wheat firms. The September opening order was 7 pence, so the opening order price rose to 71 taels, 3 qian, with the posted price increasing by 125 US dollars plus 25. The daily gold price fell slightly by 75, but it had no impact. Seeing more buyers, the price was raised to 71 taels, 7-8 qian. Later, because the September British gold could be settled at 7 pence, Huabi absorbed it. October was 7 pence 125 to 1875, and then Yuancheng, Yuanmao, Yongyiyu, and others sold off, causing the market to decline rapidly, falling by as much as 6 taels, to 65 taels, 3 qian at 10:30. After that, buyers showed some development, and McKelly bought November British gold at 7 pence 25, seeming to stabilize. Soaring back up, it suddenly jumped up 4 taels, to 69 taels at 11:45.

Mitsubishi bought November at 7 pence 25, Mitsui bought October at 1875, and Huabi did the following month at 7 pence 0625, so the gold price once again broke out of the 70-tael mark. After 1 point, Jinan and others chased after purchases, causing a surge to 71 taels, 3-4 qian. At 4 o'clock, many parties slightly unloaded, and then retreated by 2 taels. Then it was calculated as 69 taels. In the end, Hengxing and others were tireless in their buying, and people hoped to go up again, jumping out of the 70-tael mark again. At 4:30, the market closed at 71 taels, 6 qian, which was down 3 taels, 3 qian from the day before.

<p>Fluctuating and Uncertain, Trading Not Large</p>
<p>Posted Prices Continue to Lengthen by Half a Point</p>

More than 100,000 pounds of British gold were sold, and banks were still keen to buy. McKelly, Huabi, Mitsui, Taiwan, and Mitsubishi all increased their holdings, but there were occasional sales from HSBC and Xingye. Each bank had成交tens of thousands of pounds.

<p>The consultation on the matter broke down without any results. Yesterday, Director of the Bureau of Construction, Wu Wenhua, met with local gentry Mr. Niu Tixingsheng, who agreed to contribute one thousand yuan. The remaining funds will be raised by the Bureau, so telephone service in the Puxi districts of the county will be implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Term for Establishment of Trade Associations</p>
<p>It is proposed that the deadline be extended to January of the 20th year of the Republic, starting from the date of promulgation of the regulations.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request for approval.</p>
<p>(National News Agency)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday stating:</p>
<p>Subject: Request for a Petition</p>
<p>It has been found that trade associations should be established in accordance with the legal deadline. Previously, your bureau issued two directives, Nos. 2631 and 2635, which were forwarded to the relevant associations for compliance. It was also stated that the one-year reorganization deadline stipulated in Article 14 of the Trade Association Law should be counted up to August 17 of this year.</p>
<p>Recently, the Silverware and Gold Industries Association, among others, have reported that many of their committee members are away on business in distant locations, and the deadline is too tight to allow them to return in time. It is impossible to convene a general meeting as scheduled, and they have requested that the deadline be extended. The association understands that this situation may not be limited to these two industries. Furthermore, the former Commercial Reorganization Council previously stated that it could not begin guiding the reorganization of various trade associations because the implementation rules for the Trade Association Law had not yet been promulgated, and it repeatedly urged the prompt issuance of these rules. In fact, the preparations for reorganization by the various associations were fully based on the implementation rules for the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, which were promulgated on January 7 of this year.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, we hereby submit a factual report to your bureau, requesting your review and consideration as to whether to forward it for approval to extend the reorganization deadline to January 7 of the 20th year of the Republic. We await your instructions for compliance. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Regulations for the Supervision of Elections in Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Letter to Various Labor Unions</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to various industrial and commercial associations regarding the supervision of elections by party and government agencies and the execution of lottery matters for various trade associations.</p>
<p>The letter stated:</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that this association previously received a statement from various trade associations stating that it is necessary to request that the Bureau of Social Affairs be asked to interpret whether the election supervision power should be under the auspices of the party headquarters, as it involves the interpretation of laws and regulations. On the 7th of this month, this association received a response from the Bureau of Social Affairs stating that the election supervision power of the various trade associations should be in accordance with Article 14 of the Implementation Rules of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, and that the Implementation Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law Article 14 of these are applicable by analogy. The original text clearly stipulates that in addition to forwarding it to the Municipal Party Department for reference, you should also be informed.</p>
<p>After consulting with the association, it was found that item two of Article 14 of the Implementation Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law regarding election supervision stipulates that "during the aforementioned elections, the county government will send personnel to the district political and commercial associations for supervision, the municipal government will send personnel to the municipal chamber of commerce for supervision, and the Bureau of Social Affairs will send personnel to the special municipal chamber of commerce for supervision, as well as to execute the lottery matters stipulated in this law and its implementation rules." Since this method is applicable to trade associations, it can be implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>In compliance with the order, we hereby issue this letter to inform you. We hope you will take note.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Suppression of Banditry in Jiangbei</p>
<p>Telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs of the Jiangsu Provincial Government on the 9th, which read:</p>
<p>(Omitted titles)</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, this association received a letter from the Pig Traders Association stating: "This association's sales of pigs have always relied on the transfer of pigs from the producing areas of Rugao, Taixing, Taixian, Jingjiang, and other places in Jiangbei to Shanghai to meet the needs of the entire city's population. However, the distance between the producing and selling areas is far, and transportation is often difficult. When the two major bandits, Sang and Pan, wreaked havoc on the Yangtze River last year, commercial transportation came to a standstill, and the pig-producing areas did not dare to risk transporting their goods. The situation of this association was almost desperate, and we had to petition the Department of Civil Affairs of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to order the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Water Police to dispatch officers to escort the goods. Since its implementation, we have been deeply protected. Although we have still been subjected to occasional robberies by the remnants of Sang and Pan, we have still managed to get a small number of goods to Shanghai, so we have been able to operate miserably and barely survive. However, the losses of this association have already been incalculable. We were hoping for peace and stability to gradually make up for our losses, but unexpectedly, in recent months, we have repeatedly received telegrams from Rugao and other places stating that the communist bandits here are causing disturbances, making it not only difficult to transport goods but also impossible to raise livestock."</p>
<p>"It is no wonder that the arrival of goods has been decreasing day by day. If the maritime atmosphere is unstable and transportation is inconvenient, there are still preventative measures that can be taken. But now, because of the disturbances caused by the Communist Party, farmers dare not manage their own subsidiary industries, and this association's sources will be cut off, and the largest tax revenue of Jiangsu Province is feared to be greatly affected. The members of this association are burning the midnight oil, racking their brains without finding a solution. After thinking it over again and again, we can only earnestly request your association to forward a request to the Department of Civil Affairs of the Jiangsu Provincial Government to quickly dispatch troops to completely suppress the communist bandits in Rugao and other counties to eradicate their roots. Then, the farmers will be safe in the fields, the merchants will prosper in the markets, and the daily growth of tax revenue will all be thanks to your association. In addition to submitting this to the Songhu Pig Tax Bureau, we hereby earnestly request you to review and forward this request as a matter of kindness."</p>
<p>The association found that Jiangsu Province is where the capital is located and is also an important financial area. Rugao, Taixing, Taixian, Jingjiang, and other places in Jiangbei have always had simple folk customs and have been known for their honesty, which is different from the areas of Huaibei, Xuzhou, and Hai, which have historically been known for their banditry. Now, communist bandits have established nests there, and there is almost no land that is untouched. This association has repeatedly received reports from the Taixing Wine Industry Association and other industries stationed in Shanghai, and the reports from the fresh pig traders confirm that the hidden dangers are increasing day by day and the poison is spreading. The ancient saying that "fire is stored under a pile of firewood" is hardly sufficient to describe the danger. The local police force is weak and often caught off guard. Even if they are lucky enough to repel the bandits, it is only a temporary respite, and it is difficult to eradicate their roots. This is truly a problem in the heart of Jiangsu Province, and it is not only the pig traders who are suffering. The original letter from the association requested the dispatch of police to suppress the bandits, but in this association's humble opinion, the number of provincial police guards is not large, and it would be difficult to concentrate them in one place for years on end. In that case, the search and suppression power would eventually be exhausted. Moreover, most of these communist bandits collude with local ruffians and bandits. When the army comes, they become civilians, and when the army leaves, they become bandits, making it even more impossible to identify them. In our humble opinion, it is extremely difficult to gather affairs if we merely rely on the provincial police force and the county public security bureau teams to search and suppress the bandits. It would be appropriate to report to the National Government to consider dispatching troops to strictly surround and suppress the counties with the most serious banditry. After the bandit forces have weakened, it would be appropriate to start with the clarification of official governance, carefully select good officials, and vigorously implement the baojia and village defense systems to eliminate the sprouts of communist banditry. Furthermore, we would enable those who have been coerced to have a path to self-renewal. As for the plan to address the root cause, it is even more important to improve rural life, reduce excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, and alleviate the burden on their livelihood so that hidden dangers will be suppressed. Otherwise, the worries about the overall situation will not be alleviated. We dare to offer our humble opinions based on the reports from the industry. We hope that you will consider them.</p>

<p>The Qinglian Pacific Women's Association Discusses the Opium Problem</p>
<p>Huang Jiahe's Proposal</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association has learned that the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference will be held in Honolulu this year to discuss various important issues. The association believes that the problem of narcotic drugs is of great concern to all countries. Therefore, some months ago, it entrusted Dr. Ge Chenghui, a female physician who will be representing China at the conference, to submit the following statement. The association received a telegram from Honolulu yesterday stating that the conference has now opened, and the first item to be discussed is the opium problem. Representatives from various countries have expressed great sympathy for China's anti-smoking efforts. It is expected that the association's proposal will be formally adopted.</p>
<p>The original text of the proposal is translated as follows:</p>
<p>To the esteemed members of the Pan-Pacific Women's Association,</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association has learned that your conference is about to open, and we would like to extend our most sincere congratulations. At the same time, we would like to submit an important issue for your special attention. This issue is not purely a Chinese issue, but a global issue, namely, the problem of the overproduction of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>In the view of this association regarding anti-drug work, unless it is resolved through the cooperation of all relevant countries, it will be difficult to achieve significant results in the suppression of narcotic drugs in our country. However, the most painful thing is that due to political turmoil, our country is still unable to eradicate the poppy domestically. However, the experience of this pain does not make any difference to us. Currently, narcotic drugs such as morphine, heroin, and cocaine are very prevalent in various parts of China, and in areas where opium is strictly prohibited, narcotic drugs have replaced it. This is because these drugs are easier to swallow and traffic than opium, and they are also cheaper. As a result, imported drugs are spreading in China, which is a disaster for the entire country.</p>
<p>Taking Shanxi, which has always been known for its success in suppressing smoking, as an example, there are currently 500,000 people who are addicted to morphine. In 1926, the Shanxi provincial authorities seized morphine red pills 2,254 times. The situation is the same in Hebei and Shandong provinces. The Jinan branch of this association has discovered that 166 Japanese-owned pharmacies are specializing in selling morphine and red pills. Heroin red pills are most prevalent in Henan and Anhui. In Jiangsu Province, Shanghai is the general hub of the morphine trade. In Pudong, the industrial area across the river from Shanghai, there are thousands of workers who inject morphine. In Zhejiang Province, two-thirds of the previous opium smokers are now addicted to morphine. The injection of morphine is most prevalent in the three northeastern provinces. In the Japanese settlements in various parts of the three northeastern provinces, it is easy to find dozens of morphine and heroin dens, and thousands of people are shackled by narcotic drug addiction. Due to space limitations, it is impossible to describe it in more detail.</p>
<p>The situation in China today is that it is on the verge of despair under the influence of foreign narcotic drugs. According to estimates by medical experts, about 40 tons of narcotic drugs are smuggled into China every year. As such, it is impossible and hopeless for China to ban smoking. Because the production of narcotic drugs is still excessive, China's anti-smoking efforts will create a larger market for narcotic drugs. However, the determination of the people of our country to eradicate the scourge of smoking is increasing. Public opinion in the country has become a great force. This association and its branches in various provinces across the country currently have millions of members who unanimously demand the implementation of prohibition laws. However, political turmoil makes it impossible to implement prohibition laws. The public opinion campaign in the country has had a great effect. When the domestic situation gradually becomes unified, the results will be even more obvious. We have stated above that in order to prohibit opium, we also need to stop foreign narcotic drugs. This problem is beyond the power of China. Therefore, to solve this problem, it is not enough to have cooperation from other countries. Even the most efficient defense agencies in the world cannot cope with illegal trade, let alone China, with its long coastline and extensive land borders, which has become the most severely affected area by the spread of narcotic drugs. The only way to remedy this situation is to cut off the root of the poison and limit the production of narcotic drugs to legitimate uses.</p>
<p>China is the representative that suffers the most from the overproduction of narcotic drugs in Europe and Japan. We specifically request the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference to declare its opposition to the universal scourge of drugs and propose that the conference submit a strong recommendation to the League of Nations urging the next International Anti-Smoking Conference to take effective measures to limit the production of narcotic drugs to medicinal and scientific uses only. The matter of whether or not the relevant countries are sincere about this strategy is not only a matter of the happiness of the Chinese people but also a matter of the safety of all mankind.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another painful situation that we would like to bring to your attention, namely, the opium monopoly policy implemented by the great powers in their colonies in the Far East. This system does not exist in the Philippine Islands. For many years, colonial governments have made profits by selling opium to the Chinese. Only the Chinese are sold it. We believe that the great powers' use of the opium monopoly policy is to poison the people of other races for the sake of annual revenue. We demand that the opium monopoly policy be abolished immediately. We firmly believe that the voice of the women's personality represented by the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference can rise up and resist the cruel system for which the happiness of millions of people is sacrificed. We firmly believe that the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference is an organization that aims to promote goodwill among the countries along the Pacific Ocean. We view this as an excellent opportunity to systematically assist the issues described above. We believe that you will give the most careful consideration to this issue, and that your fearless spirit will eliminate the obstacles to peace and happiness in the Pacific, and we wish your conference success.</p>

<p>Postal Worker Shen Zongyong Arrested</p>
<p>Suspected of Inciting a Strike</p>
<p>Postal Authorities Detained Him</p>
<p>The Court Conducted a Preliminary Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Pending Submission of Evidence for Further Review</p>
<p>Shen Zongyong, a native of Jiangsu, is only twenty-two years old and works as a postal worker at the Post Office Headquarters at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Sichuan Road. However, he still pursues his studies and attends a certain university at night. His thinking is quite contrary to current principles. Recently, the postal authorities learned that he was suspected of inciting a strike among postal workers. If he is not stopped immediately, it is feared that trouble will arise. Therefore, Shen was placed under surveillance some days ago. However, since the post office is an agency under the jurisdiction of our government, in order to safeguard sovereignty, it should be handled by the official authorities in the Chinese area. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau was notified to send detectives to the post office to take Shen away. However, since the outside of the post office is in the concession, the police had to notify the patrol before entering the area in accordance with the usual practice. The detectives of the Public Security Bureau, according to custom, took Shen to the patrol to be investigated once before being taken back to the Public Security Bureau. However, the patrol believed that the case should be handled by the court before Shen could be taken away. Therefore, Shen was sent to the Special District Local Court the day before yesterday, where Judge Feng Shide opened the court for a preliminary hearing. The judge recognized that the case was related to the Communist Party and that the first instance should be under the jurisdiction of the Higher Court. He ordered that Shen be detained. Yesterday morning, Shen was sent to the Jiangsu Higher Branch Court, where Judge Song held a preliminary hearing. Zhang Guangren, a detective from the Public Security Bureau, submitted an official document requesting the transfer of Shen. However, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the patrol, appeared in court and stated that the Public Security Bureau had sent a document requesting the transfer of the defendant, but no evidence had been submitted. Therefore, the patrol was unable to state the facts of the case in the transfer document. He requested that the court investigate the evidence. If there is evidence, the patrol will file a public prosecution or the prosecutor of the court will file a lawsuit. If the evidence is proven, there will be no objection to the extradition. The defendant retained two lawyers, Liu Shifang and Zou Yu, to defend him. They argued that the case should be handled by the concession court. Judge Song then ordered that the defendant be detained pending the submission of evidence by the Public Security Bureau for further hearing.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in West Shanghai</p>
<p>A Three-Year-Old Boy Disappears</p>
<p>A Ransom of 500 Yuan is Demanded</p>
<p>Two Contacts Arrested</p>
<p>The Victim was Discharged from the Hospital Yesterday</p>
<p>Xiao Jin Gou, the three-year-old son of Xu Debiao, who lives at No. 12 Yongting Lane, Zhongshi, Caojiadu Town, West Shanghai, suddenly disappeared at 8:00 a.m. on the 7th of this month. It was later determined to be a kidnapping for ransom. The victim was rescued yesterday and safely returned home. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Boy Disappears</p>
<p>Xu Debiao, 43 years old, is from Anhui and works as a foreman at the Binbei Leather Factory. He is considered to be of modest means. He only has one son, Xiao Jin Gou, who is just three years old. He can walk a little and is chubby and fair-skinned. Xu loves him very much. At about 8:00 a.m. on the 7th, Xu had already gone to the factory. There was only his wife and child at home. The child was standing outside the door, and his wife did not pay much attention to him. Suddenly, the child disappeared. When Xu learned of this and returned home, he asked the neighbors, who only said that they had seen someone carrying him away but did not recognize the person. Xu suspected that he had been abducted and was extremely anxious. He began searching for him.</p>
<p>At about 7:00 p.m., Wan Qinggen and Zhang Hesheng, two people from Changzhou who worked at the Shunyu Oil Factory and were acquainted with Xu, came to Xu's house to visit. Xu told them about the disappearance of his child. Wan and Zhang readily agreed to help him find the child. Xu was very grateful and gave them two yuan for transportation. The next day (the 8th) at 8:00 a.m., Wan and Zhang returned to Xu's house and claimed that they had a lead. The child was now in Yangshupu, and someone would come to contact them at 3:00 p.m. In the afternoon, a man wearing black clothes came with Wan and Xu to Siyang Building to drink tea and talk. The man in black said that there was no problem and asked Xu to pay a few more yuan for transportation for Wan to retrieve the child. Xu gave him five yuan. Wan took the money and left. He did not return to Xu's house until 6:00 a.m. on the 9th. He said that the child was in a certain place in the French Concession and would be sent to Xu's house by car at 10:00 a.m. Wan and Zhang then left Xu's house.</p>
<p>Suddenly Demanding a Ransom</p>
<p>Xu waited anxiously, thinking that the child would arrive home at 10:00 a.m. However, he waited until noon without any news. At about 6:00 p.m., Wan and Zhang still had not returned. Xu asked them what had happened. Wan and Zhang said that they had gone to the French Concession but could not find anyone. Xu became very angry and argued with Wan. Then Wan and Zhang revealed that the child could be found, but it would cost 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Sent to the Police Station</p>
<p>Xu realized that Wan and Zhang's suspicious behavior was actually a kidnapping for ransom. He pretended to agree and negotiated with Wan and Zhang to reduce the price. At the same time, he sent someone to call the police. Zhang Yuquan, a police officer from the Fifth Station, arrived and arrested Wan and Zhang. They were taken to the Sixth District Police Station. After interrogation by District Chief Ren, Wan Qinggen, 31 years old, from Changzhou, who lives in the Binbei Workshop and works at the Shunyu Oil Factory, and Zhang Hesheng, 37 years old, from Changzhou, who lives at No. 5 Jinheli, Binbei, and works at the Oil Factory, confessed that they had demanded a ransom and that the child was being hidden at No. 37, 3rd floor, Tiansheng Hotel, Eight Immortals Bridge, French Concession.</p>
<p>After obtaining the confession, District Chief Ren immediately sent Detective Captain Liu Shaoqing with other detectives to No. 37 of the hotel. However, there was no child in the room. After repeated inquiries, the tea attendant said that two women, two men, and a child had stayed in Room 4 on the second floor on the night of the 7th and left. Liu Shaoqing and others believed that the victim had been moved and returned to the district to report. Then District Chief Ren prepared a document and sent the police to the Public Security Bureau to send Wan and Zhang for trial.</p>
<p>The Victim is Rescued</p>
<p>While the detectives were returning to the district to report, Xu Debiao received a report stating that the child had been moved to a certain place in the Changzhou countryside. Xu believed the report and on the night of the 10th sent someone directly to the village. Yesterday afternoon, Xu's son, Xiao Jin Gou, was safely rescued and returned home to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Woman Zhu Huizhen Accuses Zheng Zhengfa of Fraudulent Marriage</p>
<p>After Seduction, a Wedding is Held</p>
<p>Cohabitation for Half a Year and then Abandonment</p>
<p>Later, Zheng is Found to Have a Wife</p>
<p>The Defendant Failed to Appear After Being Subpoenaed Yesterday</p>
<p>In the summer of the year before last, Zheng Zhengfa seduced Huizhen, the daughter of Zhu Lu, a woman from Shaoxing. In February of last year, Zheng colluded with his brother-in-law, Fang Xinglin, to take the girl away. At the same time, he persuaded the girl's mother, Zhu Lu, by saying that Zheng's position was still vacant and that it would be better to marry her daughter to him to form a family. Zhu Lu had no choice but to agree. Then Zheng and Huizhen held a formal wedding ceremony, with Lu Lide as the matchmaker and Zheng Youfang as the witness. After only half a year of marriage, Zheng suddenly abandoned the girl. It was not until January of this year that Huizhen learned that Zheng already had a wife. She then hired lawyer Chen Weidong to accuse Zheng Zhengfa, Zheng Youfang (Zhengfa's uncle), and Fang Xinglin of fraudulent marriage, requesting that they be punished by law, and also filed a private prosecution to recover 5,000 yuan in child support. On the 25th of last month, the Special District Local Court subpoenaed them for trial. Only Zheng Youfang appeared in court. The other two defendants claimed to be ill and did not appear. Youfang also denied that he had been a witness. After Lao Wenbing's testimony, he lowered his head and confessed. The hearing continued yesterday, but all three defendants failed to appear. Zheng Zhengfa's father surrendered himself and claimed that his son was ill and could not attend. The plaintiff's lawyer asked where Zhengfa was ill. He replied that he was ill at his home in the French Concession. However, according to the report of Chinese patrolman No. 1689, who served the subpoena, the subpoena was delivered to the accounting room of Taihe Foreign Firm, and Zheng Zhengfa personally accepted and signed it, and he did not appear to be ill at all. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that an arrest warrant be issued to detain Zheng and the other two defendants. Judge Feng granted the request and ordered that the defendants be detained for further hearing.</p>
<p>Approaching Wedding Date, Financial Difficulties, Cai Shuming Drowns Himself</p>
<p>Lost a Hundred-Yuan Check and was Annoyed</p>
<p>Thought that the Environment was so Bad</p>
<p>Cai Shuming Decided to Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Two Suicide Notes are Pitiful</p>
<p>Cai Shuming, 21 years old, a native of Huzhou, is a silk shop clerk. He currently works at the Tongchang Silk Shop at No. 36 Jinyu Lane, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, Public Concession. The shop owner, Bu Ruiqing, is a relative of Cai and has worked with him for four years. This year, he opened the shop and recruited Cai as a clerk, believing in his honesty. Last month, he sent Cai out to collect debts, but he never returned. Some days ago, a letter was received stating that he had lost a check for one hundred taels of silver in the middle of the road and that due to his own marriage and economic problems, he had drowned himself in the river. He also attached a letter to his younger brother, Ji He. After receiving the letter, Bu reported the matter to the Water Patrol on the same evening at 7:00 p.m., requesting them to pay attention to finding the body. He said that Cai was honest and entrusted with the important task of collecting debts. His monthly salary was 30 yuan. He was to be married in October of this year. Cai's father is a senior official at a bank in his hometown. Because his son can support himself, he wanted his son to prepare his own wedding expenses. Cai may have committed suicide because he did not have this large sum of money. However, it is not known when and where he drowned himself in the river. The head of the patrol ordered the Chinese and Western patrols to search for the body.</p>
<p>The letters to Bu and his younger brother are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to Bu:</p>
<p>Brother Ruiqing,</p>
<p>I, Shuming, have been entrusted by you to go to Shuangzhi Dasheng on the 20th of last month to collect debts. When I arrived at Shuangzhi, I asked for the money from the shop, but the shop was unable to pay due to the sluggish business in recent days. I waited for several days, but it was still ineffective. When I was about to leave, I was paid a check for 100 taels of silver as interest. The remaining money would be paid after the factory's money was collected. Then I would go to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the check I received was lost in the middle of the road. I originally wanted to inform the shop to stop payment to the Shanghai Bank, but because I have been suffering from a bad environment, the pressure of the wedding date, economic difficulties, and mental confusion, I should have gone to you to explain the matter of being entrusted to Shuangzhi and the loss of the check. I think that I have been careless in my work and that the environment is so bad. I think that my death is imminent and I do not want to bother you anymore. Therefore, I have been having fun in Shanghai for several days, watching plays and drinking wine. Now that the money I brought is used up and I can no longer see you, I will commit suicide by drowning myself in the river tonight. After my death, I ask that you take care of my weak younger brother, Ji He, for the sake of our friendship for several years.</p>
<p>I am also grateful for your kindness in the underworld. The check of 100 taels that I lost will be repaid in the next life by working like a dog or horse. Our shop's new business is not easy. I hope you will be careful and avoid being laughed at by your competitors.</p>
<p>I respectfully announce this in a special letter. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Your brother, Cai Shuming, final note.</p>
<p>Letter to Younger Brother:</p>
<p>Ji He, my dear younger brother,</p>
<p>I am suffering from a bad environment, the pressure of the wedding date, economic difficulties, and mental confusion. I will leave the evil world tonight. Do not be sad after my death. You must know that many people are going to die, but only sooner or later. Please ask my younger brother to send a letter to our father to advise him. My small leather suitcase and a bag of clothes are stored at the home of a relative in Zhabei. My younger brother can go to pick them up. My younger brother can go to collect the money that friends owe me. My younger brother can also wear the clothes that I left behind, but he cannot pawn them because the money for these beautiful clothes was earned by my blood and sweat. My tears are dry and my heart aches.</p>
<p>I will not write more. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Your brother, Shuming, final note.</p>
<p>Two Kidnappers Arrested at Baoxing Lane Entrance Last Night</p>
<p>Just Wanting to Contact the Victim</p>
<p>Detectives Suddenly Jumped Out and Arrested Them</p>
<p>At about 9:00 p.m. last night, several detectives from the Public Security Bureau went to the French Patrol to report that kidnappers had sent a letter to the family of a kidnapping victim, agreeing to meet at the entrance of Baoxing Lane, Dongxin Bridge, French Concession, after 10:00 p.m. tonight, and requested cooperation in the arrest. After receiving the report, the head of the patrol immediately sent several detectives in disguise to wait. At 10:15 p.m., two elegantly dressed men came forward to talk to the contact person. The detectives suddenly jumped out, arrested the two men, and took them to the patrol station for questioning. According to the two men, they were not kidnappers and only knew the general details of the case. They had heard that the kidnappers had kidnapped the victim and had not heard from them for many days. They (the two men claimed) had written a letter to the family of the victim, ordering them to come to contact them, intending to profit from it. After hearing this, the head of the patrol handed the two men over to the detectives for strict investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Briton's Car Kills Official of Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Briton Denies Guilt and Refuses Compensation</p>
<p>The Court Orders the Widow to Sue According to Law</p>
<p>Mr. Hai Moli, a British employee of the HSBC Bank, drove a car with license number 11578 on Nanjing Road from east to west at 6:00 p.m. on the 7th of this month. When he arrived at the intersection of Fujian Road, Lu Lianjiao, an official from the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, a native of Ningbo, was walking from the north to the south on Fujian Road. Lu was blinded by the setting sun and used a fan to block his head, which obstructed his vision. He was hit by Hai's car, injured, and bled. The patrol saw him and immediately sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries on the day before yesterday. The patrol sent detectives to take the body to Fei Lun Road for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Xu to conduct an autopsy and inquire about the circumstances of the accident. Since both parties were at fault, the court ordered the car owner to give the family of the deceased compensation. However, Mr. Hai firmly denied guilt, claimed that he had no responsibility, and did not</p>
<h3>Call for Aid for the Chinese Expedition Football Team</h3>
<p>Nanhua Refuses to Assist by Selecting Singaporean Players</p>
<p>(Singapore Dispatch, August 1st) The Chinese Expedition Football Team has competed in Singapore and Java, playing a total of six matches, with two wins, three losses, and one draw. This unsatisfactory performance is due to player injuries and the lack of replacements. Therefore, team leader Yu Hengzhi took a plane from Java on July 26th and arrived in Singapore. The next day, he traveled by car to Kuala Lumpur to request reinforcements from Nanhua. The individuals he had in mind were Bao Jiaping, Ye Beihua, Li Tiansheng, and Feng Jingxiang. At that time, the Nanhua team was touring the Malay Peninsula, having won nine out of ten matches. The outstanding achievements of the aforementioned four were universally praised. If they could join the team as desired, the team's strength would be vastly different from what it is today. Unexpectedly, Mr. Yu's trip was fruitless because, although the Nanhua team members had previously promised to join the expedition, they suddenly changed their minds due to a telegram from Nanhua in Hong Kong. Mr. Yu returned to Singapore on the morning of the 29th. When reporters interviewed him, he recounted the events as described above. Mr. Yu also said, "The expedition team had agreed to cover all expenses for Nanhua team members, even providing them with clothing. They had initially hoped to tour Europe, but they did not expect this change of plans." His words expressed great disappointment. That morning, Mr. Yu visited the president of the Chinese Athletic Association, along with the president of the Singapore Football Club, Zheng Liande. The matter discussed was borrowing players as reserves for the trip to Europe. That afternoon, Mr. Yu also told me, "The inclusion of Nanhua in our European tour is not essential, as we can temporarily select players here (in Singapore)." From this, it can be inferred that the three had reached a considerable agreement on the matter of borrowing players that morning. The Singaporean sporting community has heard that the Hong Kong China Southern Tour team will also arrive here soon. It is reported that within the next month, the Nanhua team, the expedition team, and the future China Southern Tour team will all come, offering a feast for the eyes of the overseas Chinese. However, insightful individuals suggest that they could unite as one, gathering talented players and possessing formidable strength, becoming invincible. Why establish separate entities? Their words seemed to contain boundless pessimism.</p>
<h3>Detailed Records of Two Matches in Bandung</h3>
<p>One to One... Draw with Bandung</p>
<p>Zero to One... Loss to Uni Team</p>
<p>(Bandung Dispatch, July 25th) The Chinese Expedition Football Team played two matches in Bandung on the 23rd and 24th, resulting in one draw and one loss, as previously reported. Now, detailed accounts of the two matches are provided below:</p>
<h3>(One) Draw with Bandung Concluded</h3>
<p>Bandung Scored First in the First Half</p>
<p>China Scored Back in the Second Half</p>
<p>At half-past four on July 23rd, the Chinese team clashed with the Bandung selection team. Amidst the cheers of the entire stadium, the players from both teams strode onto the field. First, the Nan Sheng Company presented a silver cup to the Chinese team, which was accepted by team captain Li Huitang, whose joyful expression revealed his confidence. The fierce battle unfolded, with Bandung scoring first in the first half and China scoring back in the second half, resulting in a one-to-one draw.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Kick-Off</h3>
<p>Both sides deployed their formations, ready for action. Referee Le Huite blew his silver whistle, and the crowd erupted in excitement. The local mayor stepped onto the field to perform the ceremonial kick-off, adding solemnity to the occasion. The Chinese five forwards launched a spirited attack, quickly reaching the enemy's territory, ready to score a decisive victory. However, the opposing force was strong, and the attack was thwarted. Their fierce counterattack caused our General Sun Sijing to be injured and briefly leave the field for rest before rejoining the battle.</p>
<h3>Failure at the Last Hurdle</h3>
<p>Both sides were evenly matched, worthy rivals. As one side's siege was broken, the other side's defenses were strengthened. China's goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan's skillful defense and the reliable strength of the defenders allowed China's forwards more opportunities to advance. However, Li Huitang's leg injury prevented him from unleashing his usual magical kicks, hindering his ability to achieve the final success.</p>
<h3>Goalkeeper Breached</h3>
<p>For twenty-five minutes, neither side gained an advantage. China possessed the ability to defeat the enemy, but leg injuries and fatigue prevented them from achieving complete success. The overseas Chinese spectators in the stadium were anxious and agitated. Suddenly, the opponent took advantage of our unpreparedness and penetrated deep into our territory. The left wing advanced along the perimeter and launched a kick towards the center. Li Ning leaped to defend but was blocked by the enemy. The ball fell past him and landed at the feet of the right inside forward, who easily shot it into the goal. Zhou Xianyan was unable to save it, and the goalkeeper was breached. In the first half, China was down by one goal.</p>
<h3>Do-or-Die Battle</h3>
<p>China unexpectedly conceded a goal despite being in a favorable position, which was disheartening. At the start of the second half, Chen Jiaqiu left the field due to stomach pain and was replaced by Liang Rongde. Liang also had an unhealed leg injury and had to play injured. Center back Sun's old injury relapsed, making his movements difficult. Fortunately, they fought bravely in a do-or-die battle, and Chen Zhenhe was strong and covered the entire field, so despite the enemy's ferocity, they fought to a draw, similar to the first half.</p>
<h3>Scoring a Decisive Victory</h3>
<p>More than ten minutes passed in the blink of an eye, and the overseas Chinese were eager for revenge. Lucky general Dai, the center forward, ventured into the enemy's formation, broke through key defenses, and single-handedly reached the goal. He shot fiercely, and the ball went into the net. The overseas Chinese were overjoyed, and the applause was deafening, as their wish had been fulfilled. Not wanting to be greedy, they hoped that China would achieve the final victory, but the opponent defended desperately, leaving no opportunity for attack. As a result, the match ended in a one-to-one draw.</p>
<h3>(Two) Chinese Suffered Defeat in the Watery Battle</h3>
<p>Lost to Uni by Zero to One</p>
<p>International Match Changed to Friendly Match</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, it rained heavily in Bandung, and the Niu Hao Testerete stadium was almost flooded, preventing the match from starting at the scheduled time. At 4:40 PM, the dark clouds had not yet dispersed, but efforts were still made to continue the match because the audience was extremely crowded, and many had traveled hundreds of miles to be there. The referee committee and staff all took off their raincoats and helped to organize the field, such as filling in sand. Unfortunately, the audience was unwilling to help, which was not surprising because many of them were wearing suits, flannel pants, and shiny leather shoes, and they were unwilling to wade through the mud in such attire.</p>
<h3>Audience Protest</h3>
<p>At 4:45 PM, the referee, the committee, and other officials discussed whether or not to hold the match. The discussion took a long time. The audience, especially the gentry, became impatient and shouted loudly. At 5:08 PM, the Uni team entered the field. At that time, it had not yet been decided whether or not to hold the match, and the protests from the local audience were already very loud. A minor disturbance suddenly appeared in the stadium. The Chinese team members were in the stands, and the authorities asked them to persuade the crowd to be quiet. Li Huitang then entered the field and made a formal speech to the crowd, but the shouts of "Kick! Kick!" continued unabated.</p>
<h3>Friendly Match</h3>
<p>Finally, it was decided to hold the match, but because the field had become a swamp, it could not be considered a major international match and would only be a friendly match. The match time was two twenty-minute halves instead of two thirty-minute halves. Referee Van Herden. The expedition team's formation was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, Liang Yunde, Sun Sijing, An Yuan Sheng, Chen Guangyao, Li Huitang, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Cao Guicheng</p>
<h3>Showing Humility</h3>
<p>As soon as the match started, the expedition team continued to besiege the opponent's goal for ten minutes. Dai Linjing had several good opportunities, but he either kicked the ball out of bounds or it was caught by Mobo Radell. At 5:35 PM, Baiteng touched the ball with his hand inside the goal. Li Huitang stood behind the ball, but because this match was only a friendly match, he deliberately kicked it slowly to the side.</p>
<h3>Uni Wins the Game</h3>
<p>China repeatedly attacked, and Uni's situation was quite difficult. At 5:48 PM, Uni suddenly broke through China's siege with great effort and launched a large-scale counterattack. Gu Fudeng shot the ball, and Jing Si added another kick. As a result of this change, Zhou Xianyan was caught off guard and the ball went into the goal. Uni then won the game by one goal.</p>
<h3>Unfavorable Counterattack</h3>
<p>After the break, Chen Zhenhe replaced Chen Guangyao. At that time, the match became more intense. The Chinese team pressed hard in front of the Uni goal and there was a lot of contention. The ball was kicked into a corner, but the visitors could not take advantage of this. The Chinese team then advanced again, but was blocked by Van de Beteng. The strength of the two armies can be said to be evenly matched. The sky was getting darker, so the lights were turned on to facilitate the battle. The audience strongly supported the Chinese team. Li Huitang and others pressed hard on Uni's goalkeeper, but Gu Fudeng kicked the ball out of the field. The audience shouted loudly, seemingly disappointed that China's attack was not successful. At that time, the Uni goal was constantly being shot at. Uni's left wing Gu Fudeng also helped from behind, but to no avail. The football was snatched back by Dai Linjing and others, who then pressed hard on the Bandung goal, but to no avail. The football either flew to the side or up, or went into the hands of Uni's goalkeeper Fan Bailader. The Chinese team then lost by zero to one.</p>
