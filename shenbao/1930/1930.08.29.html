<p>時評</p>
<h3>波蘭内閣改組</h3>
<p>波蘭自復興而後。政潮連年不息。政府之改組。亦已不知若干次。而至今依然不寗。於是向以狄克推多著稱之畢蘇斯基上將。又起而組織内閣而人民反對之者。則又將聯合以向新政府進攻。波蘭政局之難以變觀固可預斷矣。惟波蘭政局所以不安寗之故。原因果何在乎在畢蘇斯基之意。認定政局之所以不穩。由於政府權力太弱立法機關權力太大。欲改革波蘭政治須從設立强有力之政府入手。欲設立强有力之政府。又須從修改憲法入手此其主張。數年前早已見之於宣言。而今日則欲實行其多年經營變更國憲之懷抱。最近談話。謂現在憲法。如一塊腐肉國會全部工作。皆發生臭味。以致空氣變毒。故憲法不能不改。其痛惡憲法。可謂至矣。然將若何修改。而能使此腐臭之國會變爲不臭。空氣變爲不毒耶。則畢氏亦曾表示其主張。謂總統須有解散國會特權、選舉法亦須修改。减少議員人數。此其用意顯然。不過欲藉變更憲法。以擴張政府權力而已。惟政府權力擴張而後果能定波蘭紛擾之政局耶世界憲法規定總統有解散國會權之國亦多矣。能皆安定而無爭耶恐無人敢斷言之者。總之畢氏固始終迷信强有力政府者。而不知波蘭之民涵育於自由者久。必不能俯首下心於畢氏之主張也。</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>餐客—侍者。你看。這靑蟹怎麽少了一個大螯。而我是最愛吃大螯的。</p>
<p>侍者—先生。因爲今天我們的靑蟹特别新鮮。放到了鐲子裏。還在彼此相打。所以有的把大螯都打掉了餐客—打掉大螯的定是敗卒。你給我把勝將請來。</p>
<p>經理（向一個謀事的童子）—咦。</p>
<p>你在一個月前不是也來過的麽。</p>
<p>童子—是的。一個月前我曾來過一次。</p>
<p>經理—當時我曾對你說。你年紀太輕。我們要一個年長些的。今天你怎麽又來了。</p>
<p>童子—過了一個月。我不是巳年長些了麽。所以我又來了。</p>
<p>甲女—現在新式的結婚。做新娘娘的爲甚麽一定要兜白紗。并穿白色的禮服。</p>
<p>乙女—這是外國規矩。白色是快樂的象徵。而結婚的一天。正是女子一生最快樂的日子</p>
<p>甲女—嗄。白色旣是快樂的象徵。那麽黑色就是不快樂的象徵了。做新郎的爲甚麽一定要穿黑色的大禮服呢。</p>
<h3>理髮匠與國家之關係</h3>
<p>— 悟拙</p>
<p>我國從前人多以薙髮匠爲賤業。故禁止下考。幾幾乎不以齊民相待。不知前清與皇帝薙髮者。爲翰林院待詔。列入極清貴之翰林院衙門。蓋前明時。人皆蓄髮。清人入關。勒令薙髮。人心思念舊君。總以薙髮有夷風。薙髮匠爲賣國之人。由恨而賤視之。其實以手工業而謀衣食。誠自食其力者。何賤之有。</p>
<p>清人鑒於人民多不肯薙髮。且賤視是業。乃予以極大之虚榮。極高之權力。令薙髮匠店門。樹立旗竿一根。（前清立旗竿爲極榮耀之事。科甲中舉後。方准建立。惟科甲係兩根。薙髮匠係一根。）上掛黄旗一面。上書「奉旨削髮」四字。違旨者斬。人民望而生畏。一律順從。以後剃頭擔子上仍沿舊制。刻小旗竿一根。上掛紅布一塊。爲利刀之用。蓋不知其所從來矣。</p>
<p>法國古時。有一皇帝某。（軼其名）赴理髮店理髮而遇剌客。適有一理髮匠替死。皇帝無恙。事後以其盡忠爲國。予以殊榮。令以國旗裹尸而葬。後理髮店均羨其榮。爭以國旗作裹尸狀。懸於店面。故現在各理髮店門首。均有紅藍白三色之捲。蓋習焉不察。只知此係理髮店之標識。而不究其從來。我國理髮館亦傲效之。眞不知其所以然矣。</p>
<p>記者按。後一說係記者之友人從考據中來。决非臆斷。試觀今日各理髮店門口所用之Ｅxcelsior係法國字。而三色又係捲用。可以證明不謬矣。各國國旗。非常重要。非有極大功勛。不能張掛國旗。我國從前之五色國旗。各處均用。甚至妓館門首。妓女鞋面。均有五色國旗。只知以此爲美觀。不知有凟國徽。予早知其不能存在也。今日之靑天白日。深望人民一致敬仰。以體先總理締造之艱。並望於中山牌之物品。尤加愼重。是爲至盼。</p>
<h3>到法蘭西去</h3>
<p>— 紅綃</p>
<p>我們住在英租界的人。常常聽到這一句話。「到法蘭西去」在初到上海的。一定要誤會爲遠涉重洋。到法國去了。其實却是到法租界去。這句話。並不限於非知識階級。明明爲知識階級的。也都這樣說。幾成爲口頭之禪。說慣了。一溜即出。我記得從前報上就有人談。國人和住居英租界的通信。往往在信封上寫着英界某某路某某。很少詳寫爲英租界的。却不知無形中已將英租界的主權放棄。無異自承這一塊土地。已不是本國領土。而爲英國的屬地了。省寫一個字的懶惰之誚。猶在其次。然而將這事拿來和「到法蘭西去」比較。則又更覺得此重於彼。單寫英界。終於是省筆。心中還知其爲租界。「到法蘭西去。」那竟直截了當的把法租界視爲法境。似乎並不知其爲租界了。但却從來没有人注意到。今午聽着這句話。忽有所感。特地寫出來。希望國人改正。最好就改說「到法租界去。」</p>
<h3>再志江北匪氛</h3>
<p>— 紅綃</p>
<p>前記如臯匪患。石莊鎭公安局以少數警察。擊潰大多數共匪事。局長宋毅父氏。爲該處商民所愛戴。倚如泰山。誠以有宋在。匪勢雖盛。而商　可保也。顧宋則以訓練警察。夙夜防維。已數月於茲。不免影響於身體健康。且自擊潰以後。匪方聲言他區警察率無抵抗力。獨於石莊鎭受挫。此仇必報。宋固不之懼。共匪報仇亦早在意中。而不圖防範依然。餉彈竟大感缺乏。馴至月終不能發餉。維持無術。共匪復於此時實行報仇。大舉進犯。警察縱明大義。可枵腹從公。而絀於彈。則無能爲力矣。於是石莊鎭遂不幸遭匪焚刦。宋兩度辭職。均不獲邀准。蓋值此恐怖時代。人皆視爲畏途。繼任難覓也。然宋留又無辦示。經一度焚刦。遷徙者愈衆。籌餉愈難。頃宋已來滬。即赴鎭江。謂巧婦難爲無米炊。抑且攖病。勿復能顧地方人士之挽留。巳堅决呈辭。但留一二局員候交卸。不再返任矣。年來江北匪氛之熾。與夫蔓延之廣。大足驚人。各縣幾無不有若干地域。淪於匪手。儼若官匪分治。官方竟無如之何。吾泰亦有百餘村爲匪所據。猖獗異常。匪區以内。人盡爲匪。其間自不乏受匪威脅。不得不爾者。省公安大隊嘗往剿。至則不見一匪。疑泰人之迭電呼籲爲無故自擾。大隊士皆三五一羣。夷然散步。熟意一轉瞬間。則田疇耕種者。廣塲操作者。肩挑擔負以及呌賣零物者。盡棄其農器而易爲精利槍械。赫然皆匪也。大隊措手不及。悉被繳械。此後遂不復敢言剿。且匪性殘酷。仇視公務人員。遇之者必不能生還。而死之之法。尤覺慘無人道。我摯友王體剛君。（乾）佐收某稅。機關所在。鄰於匪區。某日解欵赴城。中余忽遇匪。架之去。竟遭寸磔而死。事後。其弟坤懸賞二百元求遺骸。亦不可得。最近我始由來滬鄉人口中聞知之。不禁淚下。匪禍如此。我江北各縣。將不免「襄城無噍類」之悲矣。嗚呼</p>
<h3>落蘇小識</h3>
<p>— 乙乙廬主</p>
<p>一昨讀某報。見曹子繡君。紀幼時食落蘇事。畏其膩滑。淚隨箸下。其事甚趣。間嘗考之。落蘇即茄。隨地産之。色紫。故一名崑崙紫瓜。然亦有淡綠色者。形亦不一。普通者。狀如馬鈴。海鹽縣産者。長而略曲。嫩而無子。其品最上。平湖縣産者。渾圓如球。品次之。鄉人詡爲特種。余歷地少。未稔他鄉有類此者否。上海菜攤列售者。粗長而直。似王瓜。雖未一嘗。逆臆必不佳也。至如曹子所言。有扁圓者。則洎今未得一見。烹飪之法。或炸或蒸。或碎薑雜鹽漬馬鮫同煑之。味皆肥腴。古以其肥膩如酪酥。故俗名酪酥。若醬漬生食。品斯下矣。然而嗜之者。亦不在少數。吾縣有鎭名新帶。擅製醬茄。醬之之先。鹽漬使軟。榨壓使扁。所以然者。欲令苦汁從蒂中出。復令醬汁從蒂中入也。製不如法。即帶苦味。此新帶醬茄所以名聞遠近也。余平生最愛食茄。見有狼藉。輒爲歎惋。嘗閱某筆記載有狂士。喜啖鴨尾。其鄰固富室也。日宰多鴨而棄其尾。某輒長歎。甚至頓足大詈。傳以爲笑。蓋愛由乎衷。情勿禁焉。或云。酪酥有毒。食時必和以薑。或云。酪酥含硫質。宜於衰年。凡嗜韭薤者。亦必兼嗜酪酥。言之成理。自可置信。至謂茄本毒草。來自靼韃。金烏珠入中原。遍植各地。冀以毒人宋人薑煑而食。皆不死。反得其種。相爲傳播。則無稽之讕矣。</p>
<h3>日本文壇最近的一趣劇</h3>
<p>— 艾艾自日本寄</p>
<p>日本於日前怱發生一轟動邇之新聞。巷尾街頭。歐塲酒館。莫不資爲談助。其事實之悽艶。遠勝於上海黄白英與意三毛案件。驕陽西下。庭院生凉。爰濡笨記之。藉作國人談灜之一助。</p>
<p>此事之要角凡三人。即日本鼎鼎大名之文學家谷崎潤一郎。曁其夫人千代子。及名小說家佐藤春夫也。谷崎潤一郎與千代子結婚已十七年。十七年前。千代本爲前橋紺屋町之名妓。蠻腰螓首。艶稱一時。木展兒鄔之拜倒石榴裙下者。正不知有幾何人。其時俗崎潤一郎已薄負文名。執筆搆思之餘。輒作走馬花之舉。及過千代子。殆不啻驀然見五百年風流孽寃。兩情　綣。愛好逾恒。未久。谷崎氏遂量珠爲聘。藏嬌於金屋之中。自是花晨月夕。儷影雙雙。或偎坐於銀幕塲中。或摟抱作狐步之舞。有讀谷崎氏說部者。輒能言其書中所描寫之一美婦人。躍躍紙上。蓋即爲其心愛者寫照也。初不意情濤萬丈。好事多磨。同居十七載之夫婦。又重作分飛之勞燕。其仳離之奇特。允開情塲離合之新紀錄。或亦爲一種禮讓之風歟。</p>
<p>本月十八日。谷崎氏千代子佐藤春夫忽連名遍發一精緻之卡束於渠等之親友。謂佐藤春夫將與谷崎氏夫人千代子正式結婚。此事渠三人意見業已完全一致。恐諸親友尙未週知。特此奉告。並希賜諒。束尾復由谷崎氏附註。謂將隻身遠游出外旅行云云。自此項通告式之卡柬散布於社合之後。聞者莫不奔走駭告。詫爲奇聞。新聞記者更羣集於谷崎氏之門。以探詢個中眞相。谷崎氏爲人殊爽直。往訪者咸一一接見。侃侃而談。據去佐藤君傾心余妻（谷崎氏自稱）千代。實遠在十數年前。其時千代猶爲靑樓中之賣笑女郎。及千代歸佘。佐藤君因與余本係舊交。故時相往還。然過去吾殊瞶瞶。因不知其殷動過從。乃另有懷抱。日久吾始有所知。吾爲此崎形之三角關係。墮入煩惱網中。實已多時。至最近吾始毅然下一决心。自願犧牲。以成就佐藤君與千代之情愛。因吾自信吾固始終愛愛千代者。然佐藤君之愛千代亦甚篤。吾能以素所切愛之。托付於一確實能愛護伊同時又爲伊所戀慕之人。吾心良慰。此後吾孑然一身。了無牽掛。將旅行各處。恣情於山水之中。以尋求吾文學上之新資料。至吾之十五歲愛女鮎子亦同時給與佐藤君爲養女。仍與乃母同居。佐藤君不日或即遷來此間。（谷崎氏現在之住屋）爲此屋之新主人云。谷崎氏年方四十五歲。或因用腦過度所致。望之如五十許人。談話時頻頻吸其手持之旱菸。餘烟裊裊。一若表示此吸菸之人。實含有無限之隱痛者。記者復請其介紹一見千代子夫人。及其女公子。千代子雖已徐娘半老。（聞已三十五歲）而風韻猶存。櫻口微癦。恍似我國電影明星宣景琳女士。其女公子點子女士。則豐容冶態。笑聯迎人。尙一天眞爛漫之好女子也。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（七十）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>遊梵爾賽宫Ｖersailleg（五）</p>
<p>梵爾賽宮苑怎樣宏大的一個光景。决非我這技拙筆。所能形容描寫得盡致的。諸位若有游過的人。或者也有這樣同感吧—而且。决非一二天可以游遍的。我們游得有興味了。就在那第二天的一個禮拜。繼續到梵爾賽玩了一天。平常除各國的游人。或極少數偶不去森林散步溪流划舟的學生之外。是很少巴黎人去的。然而到了春假的時候更是禮拜的那一天。那眞是踵接絡繹的巴黎人來了。這一次我們議决去甘露溪划船。—我先附帶說一句。因爲梵宮前面那條御河的流水清列到甘露那樣。所以我就代它題了這個名字。—走進梵爾賽宮。就一直向園裏走。尤其是虎兒他是急於想嘗試那划小船的。風味的。他灣着臂膊。只是喊着快…快…快走。拼命前奔。眞是像水波裏的游魚那樣快樂。將要走到阿博洛波的時候。遠遠地就望見那清冽的溪水。虎兒快活的心輪眞似像火熖那樣怒故了。不料鼓著氣走溪邊。便不見有空的游船的痕跡。只望見幾十只玲瓏尖頭、游划。在中流很怱忙的往送。使我們睜着了驚異的眼光。溪的兩岸是蔚密靑葱的樹林。連綿十餘里。林中是汽車道馬道。路線極長。可以環繞宮前宮後。也有人是歡喜車游的。尤其是溪邊的一條白石行人道。裏面襯着一遍綠茵。外面映着碧藍的清流。呈現着美秀和諧而有節奏的風調。便清清楚楚將法國人的特質在這裏出現。阿虎兒呵—他的心只是望着許多少年駕着小船在那裏出神。</p>
<p>「嗡—林下的咖啡産上。雪白的棹椅。確是雅潔可愛。我們還是在這兒憩息一刻吧。」陳人浩君如此說。原來溪邊的林中設備着很漂亮的露天咖啡店。是預備游人憩息眺望的。我們就依着陳君的提議坐咖啡一面等待空船。</p>
<p>不多久。二位少年駕了一葉扁舟愈近這邊來了。虎兒便跑前去操着法語大聲問道—</p>
<p>「這船可以給我們繼續划嗎。他們時間到了不。」</p>
<p>「唯—是的。可以給你們划了。」船主人這樣回答。那兩個少年上岸之後。我們就依次上船。劉抗操着漿向外努力前進。少頃便蕩漾在這漫漫的大溪的中流了。溪水清冽。一根蘆草邊没有。眞可以說是清白的本色。兩岸都是滴翠的漫着油似的綠樹。在水中反映着綠光。這是何等嫵媚的境界呀。我們坐在一葉扁舟裏。向上流泛去。和煦的春風徐徐吹來。我纔覺得有心醉之感了。</p>

<p>廿八日電通社電云、日本銀行結帳所書之現金準備額、昨日更减爲八億六千六百八十二萬五千元、爲十一年來之最低記錄、又日銀之民間存欵、從月半起銳减爲一億五千萬元内外之小額云、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債十月期已開拍</h3>
<p>今日證交辦理交割停市</p>
<p>今日證券交易所辦理八月份期貨交割、市埸交易暫停、昨日期貨十月易己開做交易、但市面續頗閒散、計善後編遣裁兵等十月期已均做開、其他尙無市面、至各債價之趨勢、以成交稀少、求供甚平、故仍呆定、全日多祇數角盤旋、但結果以較前日稍漲、計全日現貨交易一萬八千元、期貨上午約達四百萬、下午二百三十餘萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市呈露疲怠狀</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、實緣現紗銷路滯鈍、本紗存底又見增加、原棉軟化、　外情形亦屬平淡、故新賣者集中而來、潮州帮在此數日中、抛出二萬包　該帮壓力愈重、惟有一部份賣方、扒進者亦不少、紗市因擯持已久、恐有一度大變化發現也、查十月份存賬數有四萬多包之巨、價則尙稱平靜耳、　　人標下跌一兩許　人標前市開出盤、因客帮多頭隔日稍有賣出、外棉平定、場中人心平靜、而買進者尙缺、各月跌七·八·九·錢至一兩、午後開盤形勢仍軟、跌二三錢、後以有一部份扒空、裕康八百五十包、榮興七百五十包、益裕裕大達記天隆昶記益昶申利永豐義餘三百包至五百包、買進泰昌一千三百包、愼昌八百包、吉豐達豐大昌成利昌利愼茂記協生三百包至四百五十包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市又見平疲</h3>
<p>美棉微跌···日商不動···新花生意清淡</p>
<p>棉市平疲、但美棉微跌、測其趨勢尙平、故本埠市氣未見大虚、惟新買戶缺乏、廠商態度異常岑寂、各廠均以陳棉底貨充足　日廠往年在出新之前大批抛購備廠、獨今庚舉動甚鮮、實緣印棉吸飽、可供年終有餘故新花生意未見熱閙、各路年成出品頗佳　故漢帮逢漲必賣也、</p>
<h3>漢標回跌一三錢　漢標前市開盤、以隔日</h3>
<p>多數預料美棉有續漲之勢、詎仍未動、人氣又鬆、塲内買戶缺乏、各跌二錢、午後漲跌五分、全日成交統計二萬五千四百擔、查賣出益裕一千五百擔、義餘一千四百擔、永豐一千五百擔、同興一千擔、信誠一千九百擔、愼昌一千擔、達豐振大茂記永昌德記協生九百擔至一千擔、買進天昌二千二百擔、大昌成一千四百擔、泰興一千五百擔、益成一千一百擔、裕康·明華·天隆·森康·長豐·吉豐九百擔至七百擔、茲將漢標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>海外花紗平穩之局</h3>

<h3>糧食　米市跌勢告定</h3>
<p>閘北　昨各路到源見抵十餘號、各方買戶因連跌後、進决轉濃、大勢遂告覆堅、北帮破粳頂貨回起角半、普通以下各粳均呈平定、東新粳仍在十七元左右、薄稻貨稀平庸、新客尖特高開十三元半、白元轉昻兩三角、高貨又達十八元八角左右矣、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到船十號左右、本街走銷不暢、白破頂粳貨稀微俏、開二十元○六七角、至於普通同里等粳趨勢仍不振、因該貨零拆仍不開展也、南路薄早稻來源寥落、去亦平呆、市况沉寂、東新粳到銷兩抵、跌風稍定、價開十七元、通變吊銷活潑、價格見昻、頂貨亦達十八元七八角云</p>
<h3>湘米首批近萬包到申</h3>
<p>洋米走銷極清</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、頗見呆滯、因有湘米到埠、客戶多觀望、統市祗北洋帮及散客辦去西貢一千包、價十五元八角至十五元三角半、大絞七百包、價十二元一角　高貨存少未開、行情則與前日相似、湘米出口問題、早見報載、正式開禁定於九月一日、護照費二元、在九月一日以前裝辦者、須另加手續一元、乃雜稅數角、核於八月二十二日裝出三萬左右、其中九千包左右過漢後直接裝出、該米於前日晚間及昨日相繼到申、尙有二萬餘包、被漢口當局扣住、責以另加捐稅元、方可通過、商人祗允加捐一角、致難妥合、不克與九千包同時抵埠、後批因捐稅苛重　販運不划、來源恐難踴躍也、惟聞湘省護照已認開六十多萬矣、所到之湘米係靖港機砶兩米、成本須十三四元　而昨兜售結果、機靖祗還價十三元一二角、砶米十二元半至十二元一二角、貨主以不合成本、未肯立刻脫手、故未有只包成交云、</p>
<h3>遠期粉價大軟</h3>
<p>昨日粉市開市後、各月份市價紛紛下跌、遠期市面更軟、本月份雖有社會局之干涉與限價、而市形仍居挺勢、蓋因北洋銷化已動、天津開禁之舉　似在九月一日實行、該帮已在市上抽買本月份期粉、又向某廠接洽、而廠家現粉不多　市形因此甚佳、社會局之干涉、多頭之回出、貨客之解進回籠粉均未能抑其市價也、北洋開禁之舉實行後、市面應得上漲、但天津一埠之定購洋粉、爲數極多、在最近一星期内已有百餘萬之成交、連以前定妥者不下數百萬包、均在九十月十一·十二月正月到貨、如此則遠期申粉　仍不因開禁轉好、反被客帮套買、布價步小、收市本月祗帶小二五、九十月小去一分半、十一　十二月正月各小有二分之多云</p>
<h3>近期麥上騰之勢</h3>
<p>本月期小半數已交割清妥</p>
<p>昨日期麥開市後、本月份已成遇去、九月份祗現期帶好、開價即漲一二分、十月份跟好一分、遠期各月份旣未被近期之帶好、又無買賣雙方之注意、市呈無榮無辱之象、後有長江客抛出少數、市乃回小一分、直至收市、均無變動、本月份已在交割中、交進騐貨者有百多車、騐對半數、故空頭未了結者亦祗八十車、但因貨價升格結價諸問題未决故迄今尙未了結也、此批小麥大約由行家收進、轉解廠戶、目下已有小半數結束、總數須一二日後始了完結、現貨開出四千包、市居平定之局　開出瑤灣·徐州·紹興·海州·漢口·道人橋等貨、由阜豐福新收進云、</p>
<h3>糖市　現貨日糖盛開轉平</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·一八七五、比前電回升零六二五、紐約期糖九月份價一·一三、比前遞升二分、十二月份一·二五、比升一分、明年三期份一·三八、五月份一·四六、亦各升二分、爪哇現糖價八·八七五、期糖九月份八·六八七五、十月份八·五六二五、比前僅九月份微升零六二五、公會市場劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白需要殊靜、出戶喊價七兩九錢半　次潮者七兩八錢半、問津殊寥、市象已轉平弱、磨細砂白八兩零五分、尙覺堅俏日糖Ｎ嘜七兩九錢半Ｊ嘜八兩一錢半、ＹＰ嘜七兩九錢七分半、略有交易、市則尤苛、ＹＴ嘜七兩八錢半、需要較寥、蓋以日糖廠盤自明華先白售開二萬包、價日金六元、行方進意尙濃、故又續開一萬包、明治糖</p>
<p>亦開一萬包、均係十月份交貨、市形平疲、現糖劃盤、因此實受打擊云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新桂圓昨已開出</h3>
<p>前日濟南輪所到漳州同安新桂圓、昨由各號次第開出此戩大式負較多、而陳貨又值告斷、故市情頗覺緊秀、上牌上粒開四十五兩左右、中檔三十兩左右、次十七八兩、漳貨自二十七兩許、次至九兩不一、後市勢必看鬆、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲銷仍無</h3>
<p>海外市場、中日生絲開價雖廉、奈均有行無市、廠銷不動、Ｂ級廠經價已跌進一千兩關、尙無電轉、昨祗信孚進滬白廠經十包、開利等進黄廠經十五包、價仍趨疲、</p>
<h3>義大利秋繭扯五分收成</h3>
<p>受天時之影響</p>
<p>義大利今歲秋繭、因受地震與颶風之災、頭造蠶蟻完全損失、農民又補育晚蠶、迨至二眠後、又受風雨損害、現已上簇、預計今歲全國秋繭、統扯祇五分年歲云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶續有成交</h3>
<p>昨日婺源高莊珍眉、英莊錦隆保昌天祥等行、均有進胃、全市已成交四百餘箱、市盤仍平、針眉秀眉等項、交易頗不寂寞、但售盤亦均看低、惟祁寗紅茶、自俄莊停頓以來、英行無人問及、市頗寥落云、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油秋銷將動</h3>
<p>柏油因上冬年令欠佳、致出貨减少、今度春季湖北荆宜一帶、運漢之貨尙旺、故市面尙不見如何侷促、乃人夏後、來源漸减適皂廠需用正繁、形勢漸趨到不敷銷、而市面即突飛猛進、漢市麻城油最爲缺俏、竟躍至十八兩、荆州枝江津市等油亦隨之靑雲直上　名重荆亦加至十八兩平荆十七兩四五錢、枝重十七兩二三錢、津市十七兩、爲歐戰後最新高價、本埠油行家、始則抛有定數、幸在未漲之前、業已補齊、雖稍受虧尙屬有限、惟自市面暴漲後、均不敢多備、蓋因鑒於價昻、然各地存積不厚、今據漢函所詳、各油總數祗存四五千担、恐秋令燭淘用場不易應付、故捉襟露肘、已在意中、惟麻城漢市現雖稍見回鬆、亦須十七兩、秋銷將見發動滬上存底極薄、行家尙在觀望、然而照四處情形觀之、新貨未出以前、决難望廉、惟價格旣高　銷路不免减色、行家之不背多備者　職是故也、本埠近日已稍見動、惟尙未大旺耳、聞秋淘將次第開作、市場上必不如前者之枯寂也、記之以覘其後</p>
<h3>五金　剪口鐵抛出千餘擔</h3>
<p>東白鐵存多價小···今日可到萬餘張</p>
<p>剪口鐵市面自外滙放長後、標準趨疲、故市場交易尙熱閙、昨聞天津漢口諸帮均接當地來函添辦、故市場買賣甚多、查已抛出現貨一千三百餘擔、價則因雙方均守秘密、故無從探悉、至東白鐵存貨充斥、早誌本報、而價自受紊昌錢莊拍出大宗現貨後、影響不小、計三七尺售一兩一錢二分、三六尺九錢二分、聞今日又有現貨一萬餘張可到、市况前途、良無斷檔之憂也、</p>

<h3>昨午後大雷雨</h3>
<p>各馬路上積水成渠</p>
<p>電線損壞電車停駛</p>
<p>舊屋遭雨突然坍倒</p>
<p>雷雨聲中閘北異聞</p>
<p>自入秋以來、天氣異常炎熱、近數日氣温尤高、昨日上午、陰晴悶熱、迨至下午三時十五分鐘許、天空陰雲密布、晦黑如夜、霎時雷電交作、霹壢之聲、震耳不絶、大雨亦傾盆而下、至四時另九分許、驟又電光一閃、砰然一聲、眼目爲之一暗、房屋震驚動搖、各處電燈頓時熄滅、如此響雷、實爲近數年來所罕聞、茲將大雷雨中之聞見、分錄於下、</p>
<h3>低窪之處積水成渠　大雨傾盆</h3>
<p>中、路旁陰溝、均因不及排洩、積水成渠、華界如小南門·小西門·大東門·及城内東馬橋等低窪之處、途中積水尺餘、車輛難於行駛、各居戶房屋中、亦皆水深及膝、盆桶零物、浮蕩水面、觸目皆是、公共租界中之北浙江路·二馬路·四馬路·大新街·跑馬廳一帶、亦均成爲一片汪洋、汽車行駛、水花四濺、有丈餘之高、煞是可觀、他如法租界中之霞飛路、及西新橋街·自來火街·東新橋街·等、路中盡成澤國、一般黄包車夫、紛紛載客、莫不利市三倍、</p>
<h3>電車暫時停止行駛　當雷電交</h3>
<p>作時、兩租界電車公司、爲鄭重起見、暫時停止電流、致各馬路中無有軌電車、均停頓途中、約逾十餘分鐘許、始恢復原狀、各車紛紛開行、然因行人稀少、至車中乘客未免寥落、</p>
<h3>法租界電燈線受損　法租界愛</h3>
<p>多亞路·愷自爾路·嵩山路·貝勒路·等電燈完全熄滅、直至晚間八時四十分、始得將線修好、東新橋菜市街一帶、電炬亦完全失明、經廠中立派工匠赶修、達五小時之久、至九時二十一分、始得重見光明、又大世界全塲電燈、亦於霹靂一聲時完全熄滅、各塲中均成水池、門口積水有五寸許深、一般游客往來、均以黄包車過渡、每一渡客、竟有索錢至二百文者、</p>
<h3>滬杭火車延遲到站　滬杭鐵路</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時半許、上下行各列客車、駛至中途、適值天時黑暗、陰雲密佈、雷電交作、傾刻間、風雨大作、故該路客貨兩車、均在沿路减緩行駛、以保安全、由嘉杭興至杭段、風雨更大、幸該路各處所設之電報電話兩綫、均無損壞、惟於下午起在途行駛之五·六·七·八·九·十·各次客車、駛抵到逹站時、均不能準時到站云、</p>
<h3>肇嘉路坍倒舊樓房　城内肇嘉</h3>
<p>路果子巷、財神殿隔壁、有舊樓房八九幢、年久失修、破舊不堪、現正由屋主雇工築笆拆造、業已拆去一半、尙餘西面之二百六十二號至六十六號房屋數幢、昨日午後、烈風暴雨、致墻脚鬆動、砰然一聲、悉行倒坍、幸其時雷雨滂沱、工匠他往、路上行人絶跡、並未傷人、該管警所即查傳承包之作頭訊罰、</p>
<h3>閘北雷電中之異聞　閘北方面</h3>
<p>大雷雨時、馬路上之電氣方棚間、亦有損壞者、如順徵路·光復路·及江灣路·等是、閘北水電公司、當即派工前往修理、惟有一事、頗稱異聞、據稱、車袋角通濟路漢中路口、山東人龔良夫所開之順河茶園、昨日下午五時許、大雷雨交作時、龔之子龔定海、正在看報、忽聞霹靂一聲、直穿戶牗、頓時板門爐灶及地上、發現如血水之流液甚多、即龔手所持之報紙上、亦濺有紅色之血點、當時哄動左右、莫不嘆爲異事云、</p>
<h3>蔣鼎文派員</h3>
<p>慰問九師負傷官兵</p>
<p>專員昨由杭來滬</p>

<p>Anfu and Xiajiang Have Both Been Recovered</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Jian, considering Liu Ping to be a dangerous location, has ordered various units to gather in the Yichuishi and Jiaoxiling areas to block and intercept. Gong Shi went to Yuezhou from Miluo, and Luo Lin stayed in Xiangtan, responsible for separate blocking. Xie Bin's First Brigade, Liu Zhuming's unit, was also ordered to open up to Jianli to increase defense, scheduled to start on the 29th. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Military News: Dai Minquan rushed to suppress the bandits in Xiadian, but was suddenly supported by the Red Army. After Dai's fierce attack, about a thousand bandits were killed, and hundreds of captured bandits were executed by firing squad. Dai reported victory to Hankou on the 28th. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Curtiss warplanes arrived in the province on the 26th and will now fly over the bandit areas for reconnaissance and bombing. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Lu Diping received a telegram from Tan Daoyuan stating that Yue Sen's brigade can arrive in the province from Guide at the end of the month. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Zhu and Mao, due to the joint suppression by the three provinces, have the tendency to change course to Yonglian and flee to southern Jiangxi. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Deng's troops captured Anfu, Zhang's troops captured Xiajiang, and Ma's brigade repelled the bandit troops who besieged Ganzhou, falsely claiming to be the 22nd Army. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Lu Diping flew around the city for about thirty minutes on the 27th, inspecting the area. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liaison Between Yunnan and Guangdong Armies</h3>

<p>(Hong Kong) The telegram reporting Yu's troops capturing Binyang had not yet arrived in Guangdong by noon on the 28th. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang arrived in the province at 5 p.m. on the 27th. The purpose of this trip is related to the preparation for the fourth provincial representative assembly.

<h3>Compilation of Military Reports from Various Parties</h3>
<p>Lanfeng is Surrounded</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: (1) The enemy on the Longhai front retreated 60 miles from the defense line automatically on the 26th. The enemy on the left flank retreated to Zhengzhou and Kaifeng in droves. Our side advanced step by step without deep pursuit. There seemed to be changes within the enemy, and the war is about to be resolved. (2) The enemy on the Jinpu Railway front has retreated. In the Dezhou and Pingyuan area, the Jin army's formation is extremely sparse. Our army used airplanes and artillery to cover the advance. When the Jin army saw our planes, they scattered and fled. Yan repeatedly telegraphed warnings, but it was ultimately ineffective. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Naiwen, the commander of the Fourth Independent Brigade directly under the Central Government, reported to Beijing: (1) Dajindian, which belongs to Dengfeng, has been occupied by our brigade, and the enemy fled into the city to defend it to the death. (2) Each county in western Henan has plainclothes teams mixed in. The remnants of Feng's rebels are all extremely panicked. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military News: The Central Army's Xu Yuanquan and other units have approached Lanfeng. There were fierce battles on the 26th and 27th, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties.

(2) There were a total of 58 regiments of the Jin army on the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways. After being defeated by the Central Army, only six regiments retreated to the Yellow River bank, including Wang Jingguo's four regiments and Li Fuying's two regiments. The situation is extremely embarrassing. Yan, because decades of operations were destroyed in one day, frowned all day long and was extremely frustrated. (3) Yan Xishan forcibly collected 100,000 yuan in military expenses from the citizens in Beijing. The citizens strongly opposed it, and Yan will use force to implement the purpose of collecting taxes. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military News: Xu's army, Han's brigade, attacked Shuanglou and Zhang Dazhuang on the 28th, and Zhang's brigade attacked Qi Laozhuang, all of which were occupied. Xiao's troops are also approaching Taikang. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Polish Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Since its resurgence, Poland has experienced endless political turmoil. The reorganization of the government has occurred countless times, and it remains unstable to this day. As a result, General Piłsudski, known for his dictatorship, has once again risen to form a cabinet, while those who oppose him will unite to attack the new government. The unpredictability of Poland's political situation can be foreseen. However, what is the reason for Poland's political instability? Piłsudski believes that the instability of the political situation is due to the weakness of the government's power and the excessive power of the legislative body. To reform Polish politics, a strong government must be established. To establish a strong government, the constitution must be amended. This has been his claim for years. Today, he wants to fulfill his long-held ambition to change the national constitution. In a recent speech, he said that the current constitution is like a piece of rotten meat, and all the work of the parliament smells bad, causing the air to become poisonous. Therefore, the constitution must be changed. His disgust for the constitution can be said to be extreme. But how can it be amended to make this rotten parliament not stink and the air not poisonous? Piłsudski has also expressed his views, saying that the president must have the power to dissolve parliament, and the election law must also be amended to reduce the number of members. His intention is obvious, but he wants to expand the power of the government by changing the constitution. But can the expansion of government power really stabilize Poland's turbulent political situation? There are many countries in the world whose constitutions stipulate that the president has the power to dissolve parliament. Can they all be stable and without dispute? I am afraid no one dares to say that. In short, Piłsudski has always believed in a strong government, but he does not know that the people of Poland have been nurtured in freedom for a long time and will never bow to Piłsudski's views.</p>

<p>Foreign Overstocked Goods</p>
<h3>Competing to Dump in Our Country</h3>
<p>Japan's Exports to China Increased Twofold in July</p>
<p>China Truly Becomes the Dregs of Foreign Goods</p>
<p>World News Agency says, according to a report received by the Industrial Department Investigation Section of the Osaka City Hall, Japan's exports to China in July reached 35,909,000 yuan, an increase of more than twofold compared to the previous month. Taking Osaka as an example, the amount reached 12,075,000 yuan compared to 8,695,000 yuan in the previous month, an increase of about 4 million yuan. However, this is not due to a strong normal buying demand in China, but rather the result of an increase in strenuous dumping to China to recover from the sluggishness of the domestic market, taking advantage of the slightly stable exchange rate. Currently, due to the unrest in the Yangtze River area, overstocked goods in Shanghai have increased. The Japanese warehouses alone have exceeded 25,000 tons, with a large influx of sugar, cotton cloth, paper, Portland cement, building materials, and sundry goods. However, this phenomenon is not unique to Japanese goods. The current market sluggishness is a global phenomenon, and countries such as Britain and the United States are struggling to dispose of overstocked goods domestically and are dumping them in China, engaging in fierce competition in cotton yarn, cloth, artificial silk, matches, machinery, automobiles, flour, etc.</p>

<h3>Opening a New Route Between Europe and Asia</h3>
<p>Direct Line from Baghdad to the Mediterranean</p>
<p>Building a 600-Mile Railway</p>
<p>Baghdad, 27th (Reuters) - The plan for a 600-mile railway from Baghdad directly to the Mediterranean is now underway. It is expected that the completion of this route will provide another route from Europe to Iraq and the Far East. Many British engineers employed by the Iraqi Railways, who have practical experience in desert railway work, are currently being borrowed by a British company and will soon begin surveying and mapping the railway from Baghdad to Haifa. It is expected that this route will be completed in five years, proceeding in conjunction with the pipeline project from the Iraqi oil fields to the Mediterranean. In the future, this new route may seize a large portion of Middle Eastern trade from the Suez Canal.</p>
<h3>British Empire Actively</h3>
<p>Developing Overseas Wireless Telephones</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) - This morning, the Daily Mail reported that wireless telephone service between Britain and India is now fully arranged and ready to begin operation. Both countries have prepared adequate radio stations, and once the necessary contract regarding the opening is agreed upon, communication can begin. The plan for wireless telephone service between Britain and South Africa is also progressing well. The opening of the above two wireless telephone services depends on the outcome of the upcoming Imperial Conference. According to the agenda of the Imperial Conference, there is indeed an important issue regarding the development of imperial wireless telephones. The United States Postal Service also intends to develop direct wireless telephone service to various overseas autonomous territories, Egypt, and the Far East. In the future, after communication begins, Australia can be expected to have telephone conversations with India or South Africa via London. ·German Communist Party</p>

Newspapers of various parties have commented on this, mostly with left-wing newspapers believing that it is a collaboration between communism and extreme nationalism, solely for the purpose of destruction, while newspapers of the National People's Party welcome the Communist Party, also beginning to declare war on treaties that enslave the German people.</p>
<h3>Russo-Japanese Relations Will Not Deteriorate</h3>

Regarding the fishery issue, I cannot comment. There are many solutions to the problem. Crab fishing boats and other fisheries should not be confused with treaty relations at all.</p>
<h3>Soviet Government</h3>
<p>Executes Ten More Silver Hoarders</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Reuters) - News from Moscow states that the State Political Department has executed ten more people for hoarding large amounts of silver and spreading counter-revolutionary rumors. The Russian authorities' killing of those who hoard silver is part of their policy to actively dispel the panic among farmers in the central provinces about the stability of paper money. Difficulties in purchasing goods with paper money have occurred in several places due to this panic. When many stores refused to accept paper money and generally doubled the value of goods when purchasing with paper money, some people hoarded silver. The State Political Department then decided to designate silver hoarders and price-gouging speculators as counter-revolutionaries, hoping to cause financial collapse.</p>

We earnestly request that your esteemed newspaper office, mindful of the oppression of national goods and sympathetic to the daily decline of people's livelihoods, publish a great opinion, warn Shanghai factories, refuse to purchase, do not be fooled by the Japanese, and cause future worries. We also hope to awaken farmers across the country to strive together to avoid being controlled by imperialism, thereby maintaining the life of our Chinese sericulture. In haste, we await your instructions. Respectfully, all farmers of the three counties of Sheng, Zhu, and Xin.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Letter to Enemy Soldiers</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Commander-in-Chief Chiang previously submitted a request to the National Government to issue a proclamation to the enemy soldiers, exhorting them to break away and return. The National Government has already issued a clear order to announce it. Now Chiang has also issued a letter to the soldiers of the former Second and Third Army Groups, printing 100,000 copies and sending airplanes to drop them on the enemy's positions. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"To Generals Lu Ruibo, Xu Cichen, Zhang Tongxuan, Fu Yisheng, Shi Hanzhang, Sun Cuiyan, Yang Guangfu, Sun Shaoyun, Song Mingxuan, Liu Lanjiang, Sun Fanglu, Zhang Chuyu, Deng Baochan, Pang Gengchen, Li Shumin, Wang Zhian, Zhang Mingfu, Li Muyan, Feng Yunqing, Yang Yiru, Guan Juren, Liu Xingcun, Sun Dianying, Liu Ziliang, Ji Shiwu, Liang Zichao, Zhang Jinchen, Ge Yunlong, Gao Shuxun, Zhang Yinxiang, An Shude, Ren Ruizhou, Shi Zhenqing, Song Tiancai, Liu Mingwu, Liu Xingda, Zhao Youqin, and others: Chiang Kai-shek and all of you generals are members of the National Revolutionary Army. The purpose of the National Revolution is to break the feudal thinking of warlords, eliminate the bad habits of separatist rule, and consolidate the central government in order to complete the unification of the country, so that we can then fight against the imperialists to seek China's freedom and equality. The duty of soldiers is especially to defend the central government, protect the people, obey the party-state, promote unification, and build our Three Principles of the People China. This is what I strive to do, and this is what I expect from all of you generals. Baichuan Huanzhang, follow this principle and lead all of you generals as the vanguard of the revolution. Then he is a true leader of you generals and a friend of mine. If he violates this principle and induces you generals to be tools of counter-revolution, then he is directly a criminal of you generals and an enemy of mine. Unfortunately, the warlords have just been eliminated, and imitators have sprung up one after another. Unification has just been completed, and destroyers are blatantly unbridled. This is all because Baichuan Huanzhang is misled by the mentality of separatist selfishness and the instigation of shameless politicians, not hesitating to sacrifice national rights and people's lives, and use the glorious revolutionary history and precious political lives of you generals for his desperate gamble. Since the start of the war, blood has been shed for thousands of miles, and the dead are piled high. All are our comrades. The intensity of the war is unprecedented. We used to share hardships together, but now we are enemies. Thinking about it in the quiet of the night, I want to cry but have no tears. I have also repeatedly presented the pros and cons to you generals, and clearly pointed out the way out. It is only because Baichuan Huanzhang is still obsessed with his ability to lead the army, the strength of his troops, and the vastness of the combined reactionary forces, thinking that he can easily become a powerful force. His coercion of you generals is very strong, and you generals are also forced by the environment and can do nothing. This is what I deeply regret and understand. However, the difference between obedience and disobedience is judged by success or failure. Those who rebel against the central government and resist the revolution will ultimately have no chance of success. As of today, the situation of success or failure is already very clear. You generals must have thought deeply about how to plan for yourselves. My love for you generals has never changed. Now, on the 22nd of this month, I telegraphed the central government to plead for you generals. The original telegram has been printed separately and can be read without further elaboration. However, there are still two things I want to tell you generals. Please consider them carefully.</p>
<p>(1) If you generals continue to die for Baichuan Huanzhang from now on, you will not only make unnecessary sacrifices, but also increase Baichuan Huanzhang's guilt. If Baichuan Huanzhang does not change his warlord separatist behavior, then his defeat is no longer a question today. If he fights righteously to maintain unification and defend the country, then even if there is only one soldier left, he should fight to the death and regard death as home in order to maintain the supreme honor of a soldier. Unfortunately, Baichuan Huanzhang is a criminal who betrays the central government, destroys unification, and endangers the country. His pretext for raising troops is only me personally. I have repeatedly stated in recent years that as long as national unification is maintained, the central government is consolidated, and the political training and construction and the National Revolution can be carried out effectively, I can retire at any time. However, having been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the whole country, if I suddenly abandon my duties due to the anger of those who hold troops, then what Xu Shichang and Cao Kun did will once again plunge the whole country into a desperate situation of declining discipline and fragmented mountains and rivers. How can a true revolutionary bear to cause endless disasters to the country due to his own greed for life and fear of death? Therefore, Baichuan Huanzhang, because he failed to coerce me, suddenly raised an unjustified army and committed treason, seeking his own destruction, which is not worth regretting. However, the number of national vitality and people's lives that have been lost and harmed is unknown. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the responsibility lies with him. If the war is prolonged, the sins will increase. You generals love people with virtue. Even if you don't plan for yourselves, you should also plan for Baichuan Huanzhang, advising him to lay down the butcher knife as soon as possible and strive to repent. If you know that his fate of defeat cannot be reversed, and you are still willing to die with him, and do not hesitate to sacrifice national vitality and the lives of your subordinates as funeral goods, it is not only unwise but also unkind. Such a death is not only without honor, but will also be spurned by the world, and Baichuan Huanzhang's crimes in history will not be redeemed for a hundred generations. I know that you generals will certainly not do this. (2) If you generals still do not change course at this time, then you are not dying for Baichuan Huanzhang, but directly becoming tools for the 改組派 (Reorganization Faction) Communist</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Party, which is evil. You generals have followed Baichuan Huanzhang for many years and cannot bear to leave him in times of crisis, which is also human nature. However, when comparing the survival of the country, the life and death of the nation, and personal feelings, which is more important and which is lighter? You generals must be able to distinguish them. In terms of the overall war situation, Baichuan Huanzhang's defeat is beyond doubt. Even if you generals die for him and do not leave, it will not benefit Baichuan Huanzhang's military in the slightest, but will only increase his crimes, as I have said before. What is even more dangerous is that the evil Communist Party and the 改組派 (Reorganization Faction) who collude with the Communist bandits are taking advantage of the prolongation of our war to arbitrarily disturb and broadly engage in activities. The disaster between Guangdong and Hunan is obvious and early, and the disaster in the provinces of Tianjin and Hebei and the Northwest is even more hidden and imminent. In the past, the 改組派 (Reorganization Faction) created opportunities for the Communist Party in Guangdong and Hubei. Now, they are colluding with the Communist Party, provoking our revolutionary soldiers and making us fight each other in order to spread their poison in Tianjin and Hebei. At this time of desperation, they will surely take measures that go against the tide of history, so the disaster of communism can spread throughout the country, and you generals will no less than be their tools invisibly. The crimes of the Communist bandits who kill, set fires, and are willing to be tigers for the red imperialists will be borne by you generals together. This is especially what you generals cannot bear to do.</p>
<p>You generals must be able to recognize the times and assess the situation and make a quick decision. The Premier said that the wisdom of revolutionary soldiers lies in distinguishing obedience and disobedience, distinguishing right and wrong, and understanding the pros and cons. I have already explained it to you generals in detail. The National Government believes that what I said is not wrong and has announced it to the world, clearly telling you generals the way to decide for yourselves. You generals must not easily believe the rumors spread by treacherous people to alienate our revolutionary soldiers and fall for their poisonous schemes. Look at my past actions. Is there even the slightest fact that is like what the rumor-mongers say? The National Revolution has not yet succeeded, and the Communist bandits must be extinguished urgently. What is expected of the joint efforts of you generals is extremely urgent. I will never dare to discriminate in the slightest. My telegram and the orders of the National Government must be regarded by you generals as healing soil. However, the danger of the country and the suffering of the people have reached the extreme. No matter what, the war must be ended quickly. At this time, you generals have no room for hesitation. It is best to advise Baichuan Huanzhang to release his troops and withdraw immediately. Secondly, each should seek a way to save himself, turn against adversity and follow obedience in order to promote the resolution of the war. I will certainly love and protect them sincerely. If you do not understand me, you must force me to make a final settlement, then there is no escaping the righteousness of supporting the party-state, maintaining unification, and realizing the ideology. However, it is not what I want. I respectfully express my heartfelt feelings, hoping for your judgment. Chiang Kai-shek, August 24, 1930."</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Department Receives Press</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 28th in the Second Conference Hall of the Central Committee. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Secretary Zhang Tingxiu chaired the meeting and introduced Central Committee Member Gui Chongji, who reported that since the reorganization of our party, it has experienced the Communist Party's delusions of usurping party power, the split between Ning and Han, the Guangdong Incident, and the rebellions of Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Fakui, Tang Shengzhi, and others. Most recently, the general rebellion of Yan Feng and all reactionary elements has occurred. Although the times of the occurrence of the rebellions are different, the thread is Wang Jingwei alone. It can be said that none of the successive rebellions was not brewed by Wang Jingwei. For example, the recent Changsha Incident and the disturbances of the Communist bandits in Jiangxi were all instigated by Wang. Everyone knows these facts, so we don't need to find other evidence. Wang should be held responsible for the loss of people's lives and property over the years. However, what we lament is not the loss of material things. The loss of material things, such as the Changsha Incident, can be recovered after ten years and can be remedied slowly. However, the political morality destroyed by Wang will henceforth have a bad influence on Chinese politics. Wang was fooled by the Communist Party, does not talk about political morality, but only engages in mischief, only knows personal interests, and does not care about political morality. This is what we are most heartbroken about. What Wang Jingwei opposed to the Gui clique in the past can now be turned into friendship. What he condemned the warlords in the past can now join hands with Feng. Since politics does not speak of morality, but only uses trickery, this kind of atmosphere is a major change in China in five thousand years, and its impact on future politics is profound and important. In European countries, different political views exist, but acting on emotions because of different political views, disregarding the life and death of the nation, and only knowing the satisfaction of personal desires, no matter how skillful they are, are not enough to be called statesmen. The Premier said that politics is the business of the masses, and the survival of the masses is the principle of politics. China has used morality as the principle of politics for thousands of years. Those with virtue occupy high positions. The ancients have already said it. In short, politics is to enable the masses to survive, so to clarify right and wrong, so politics is morality. As for Western politicians, many of them also do not talk about morality because of national concepts and the interests of the entire country. There are also quite a few of them. Strictly speaking, these politicians are not enough to be first-class politicians. Moreover, Wang Jingwei in China does not talk about political morality, does not talk about national interests, but only knows how to use someone and use a certain party to fight for personal rights. His distance from the two things of politics is really far away. The ancient Chinese saying that to guide with virtue and align with propriety, there is shame and one is corrected, speaks very earnestly about morality and politics. Looking at ancient and modern China and abroad, there has never been anyone who speaks of politics without regard to morality. What Wang Jingwei has shown in the past few years can be summed up in one sentence: he can be said to be ignorant of politics. Not only is he ignorant of politics, but he is not even qualified as a citizen. Therefore, after Wang went to Peiping, a part of the young people who were anesthetized by Wang were also greatly disappointed. Wang Jingwei's defeat is beyond doubt. At best, he can only slightly hinder the development of the central government. Wang Jingwei is finished. What is hoped for from the press is to weigh the gains and losses from this moral standpoint of right and wrong, so that the concept of not talking about morality in politics and only knowing interests can be swept away. I humbly hope to encourage each other with colleagues in the press. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Reorganization Decision of Shandong Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang came to Jinan on the 21st and held a meeting with Han Fuju, the Shandong Provincial Government has decided to reorganize. Former Chairman Chen Diaoyuan will reportedly be transferred to Anhui. Han Fuju will be appointed as the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. Han initially declined firmly, but after Chiang's persuasion, he agreed to take office. As for the personnel selection of the committee members, in general, in addition to Han serving as Chairman, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department will be Li Shuchun (former Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Henan), the Director of the Finance Department will be Wang Xiangrong (former Director of the General Supply Department of the First Army Group), the Director of the Agriculture and Mining Department will be Wang Fangting, the advisor of the First Army Group. The rest, Zhang Yue (Chief of Staff of the First Army Group), Zhang Fang, Zhang Honglie (the two Zhangs were both former members of the Henan Provincial Committee), etc., are all members of the Provincial Committee. Among the six directors of the old provincial government, only He Siyuan, the Director of the Education Department, will remain, and the rest will be replaced uniformly. This order can be issued within days. Currently, the provincial government, except for the Education Department, has not started working in other departments, or that is why. Jiang Bocheng is reportedly also one of the new members of the Provincial Committee (24th).</p>
<h3>Reinstatement of Tianjin-Pukou Railway Employees</h3>
<p>All Those Transferred by the Jin Army Shall Be Returned</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: When the Jin Army entered Shandong, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway replaced many employees at various stations. Now that Jinan has been recovered and the Jin Army has retreated, Mao Qihuan, the Chief of the Traffic Department of the Railway Bureau, has issued a special telegram, ordering the staff of each station to return to their original posts, and stipulating seven measures to be followed. The telegram forwarded by the Tianjin-Pukou Station is recorded below. Case: Received a telegram from the Chief of the Traffic Department, which reads: Received a clever telegram from the Management Bureau, which reads: Now that Jinan has been captured and the stations in the northern section will also be restored in order. Seven measures are hereby stipulated to rectify the situation as follows: (1) All new committee employees of the enemy shall be dismissed. (2) Employees of this railway who were suspended or forced to leave their posts by the puppet bureau and have been reassigned by this bureau or temporarily transferred to work in the southern section shall be reinstated to their original positions with their original salaries. (3) Those who were suspended by the puppet bureau and did not report should have the situation investigated by the competent personnel and reported to the bureau for verification. (4) Those who were not suspended by the puppet bureau shall continue to work as before, unless there is suspicion of collaborating with the enemy. (5) Employees of each station who left their posts due to military affairs shall return to their posts within ten days after the station is recovered. (6) All employees ordered to return to their original posts who do not report to work within the deadline shall be listed by the competent department and reported for verification. (7) The responsible personnel should thoroughly investigate and report the details of the recovery of each station, etc. Continue to receive the Chief's telegram, which roughly states: The above seven measures are important. The fifth item, which orders employees who have left their posts to return to their posts within ten days after the station is recovered, is of great importance. Tracing back to the establishment of the puppet bureau, there must be many employees who voluntarily changed their jobs or were forced to leave their posts. Now that the northern section is about to be recovered, it is necessary to plan ahead so as not to cause delays. The chief of each division should investigate and determine which station the vanguard of the national army has advanced to at any time, and immediately inform the station of the previous bureau telegram in detail. If there are employees at the station who have left their posts, they should immediately try to inform them, either by telegram or by sending a special person. It is hoped that they will handle it appropriately according to the situation. The stations recovered after this should be handled in the same way, etc. Received this, all should be notified together, and the stationmasters of each station close to the stations that have been recovered should forward the telegram to be known in turn. Mao Qihuan, (24th).</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Raising Treasury Bonds in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Complains to Minister Song of Finance</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In addition to discussing a 3 million yuan salt tax loan with Hankou banking circles during his visit to Hankou, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen also contacted Wu Xingya, Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government, and Zhang Guanshi, Director of the Department of Finance, to propose that Hubei Province subscribe for 2.2 million yuan in customs treasury bonds. It is said that the provincial government, considering that Hubei Province has been affected by wars and banditry, and that both public and private sectors are in financial difficulties, has no surplus capacity to subscribe. They have already replied to Mr. Song by letter, elaborating on the difficulties and requesting that the Ministry of Finance handle it directly. The original letter is recorded below: "We should comply with your proposal to raise 2.2 million yuan in short-term customs public bonds. However, looking at the financial situation of Hubei Province, it is already in a desperate state. At this time when resources are exhausted, it is not easy to raise such a large sum of money in a short period of time. The difficulties are described as follows: (1) The essence of this province is centered on the three towns of Wuhan. Among the three towns, Hankou is the most affluent. Therefore, Hankou has always been relied upon for subscribing to public bonds. Now, the Hankou Municipal Government has been ordered to raise and sell 500,000 yuan of the aforementioned public bonds. Therefore, no additional subscriptions can be made within the city area. This is the first difficulty. (2) When local financial resources cannot cope with the sale of public bonds, the only option is to first ask the banking sector to advance some funds for emergency relief. Now, it is heard that the banking sector in Hankou is negotiating a large loan with the Ministry of Finance. The capacity of each bank is limited. Having already agreed to one party's loan request, they cannot fulfill the requests of other parties. This is the second difficulty. (3) It has always been the practice to include a certain percentage of subscriptions under the consolidated tax items. Regardless of whether the abolition of likin is implemented on schedule, there are already subscriptions for cigarette treasury bonds under the consolidated tax items in Hubei Province. All treasury bonds are issued by the Ministry of Finance. Having already subscribed for cigarette treasury bonds, it is impossible to raise customs public bonds again, nor can one be stopped to raise the other. This is the third difficulty. (4) The various administrative expenses of Hubei Province and its county governments and financial bureaus are currently insufficient due to the county tax not being enough for distribution, and with bandits and communists everywhere, tax revenue is unavailable. They have repeatedly requested the provincial government to subsidize administrative expenses, and they cannot even take care of themselves, let alone have the surplus capacity to underwrite these treasury bonds. In the past, when the local area was peaceful, there was no success in handling this. How could it be successful at a time when the source of chaos is endless? This is the fourth difficulty. (5) Since recent months, the provincial treasury revenue has only been over 300,000 yuan per month. The situation of financial strain can be seen in general. Even if the provincial treasury is used to meet this need, it will still take five or six months. This is the fifth difficulty. If it is absolutely necessary, we can only ask the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to Hubei to investigate the local situation and handle it jointly, which may yield some results. Otherwise, if Hubei Province handles it on its own, at best, it can only underwrite one or two hundred thousand yuan."</p>
<h3>Opening of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Pacification Conference</h3>
<p>He Yingqin, Chairman, Reports on the Purpose of the Conference</p>
<p>Representatives from Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces Report on the Communist Bandit Situation</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Pacification Conference was held at 8:00 a.m. on the 27th in the second-floor hall of the Wuhan Headquarters. Before the meeting, Director He sent Section Chief Tan Baoshou of the Liaison Section and Adjutant Jiang Jun to receive the attending representatives and issue temporary entrance and exit permits made of yellow silk, with the words "Temporary Entrance and Exit Permit for Personnel of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Pacification Conference" written on them, for the representatives to enter and exit on time during the conference. The meeting officially began at 8:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Attendees: Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, Hua Peng, Zuo Duo, Xiao Ruolu, Zhang Qibiao, Ouyang Xin, Tan Changkai, Yu Xiangsan, Xie Liangyu, Yin Jingting, Lu Xiaochen, Wang Yinxi. Headquarters staff attending included Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Lun, Chief of the Staff Department Zhou Wei, Deputy Chief Zhou Shaojin, Chief of the Military Law Office Yuan Zhuqiao, Confidential Clerk Chen Nankun, and eighteen others. Chairman He Yingqin presided over the meeting, and after the opening ceremony,</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Mr. He immediately reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating: "This time, the National Government ordered the headquarters to handle the suppression of bandits in the three provinces. This responsibility is very important. The establishment of the headquarters is to guide the frontline operations against the rebels. Recently, the communist bandits in various provinces have become increasingly rampant, burning, killing, looting, attacking cities, and seizing land, filled with red terror. In the past, the suppression of bandits in various provinces mostly avoided the concept of provincial boundaries, and it was considered complete to trick the communist bandits out of the provincial boundary. They did not want to interfere with what happened in other provinces. Therefore, the bandits fled east and west, unable to be eradicated, but instead became more widespread. The National Government, seeing this, specifically ordered the headquarters to bear this heavy responsibility, to take overall consideration and seek a fundamental solution, in order to correct this malpractice. During the period of the Wuhan pseudo-government in the sixteenth year, Wang Jingwei wanted to satisfy his desire for leadership and did everything by any means, obeying Borodin, resulting in widespread redization. The communist bandit forces in the three provinces were rampant. After the Wuhan pseudo-government collapsed, the communist bandits lost their protector and scattered to various villages, living a bandit life. Today, within the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi and their borders, there is almost no place without bandits. All of this is the root of the disaster planted by the Wuhan pseudo-government. According to a rough investigation, there are about a dozen armies of communist bandits in the three provinces. The number of people in each army varies, some with about a thousand people, and some even becoming an army. In total, there are about 20,000 guns in various groups, and the Red Guards are present in all counties occupied by the bandits. There is also a considerable organization within them, and the Soviet Union is secretly providing assistance, which is a hidden danger to the party and the country. Therefore, the current plan is to gather the military forces of the three provinces, encircle and suppress them, and completely eliminate them. Their crimes are heinous, and they have brought it upon themselves, and they cannot be tolerated any longer. Now, the Commander-in-Chief, with the military victory on the Jinpu Railway and the recovery of Jinan, has specially transferred a large force south to assist in the suppression. The Third Training Division has already arrived, and the majority will be transferred in succession. However, this matter concerns the well-being of the three provinces. The headquarters' guidance and suppression is only a temporary solution. The political and party affairs of the three provinces must work in parallel and complement each other to achieve effective results. Most of the people are ignorant and easily anesthetized by the communists. This should be promoted by the party affairs, to awaken the people and not be deceived. In politics, make great efforts to improve, and assist the people's ability to defend themselves, to supplement the army's shortcomings. The party, government, and military all have the same important responsibility for this, and must work together to achieve it. Therefore, today, I specifically invite all comrades to this meeting to discuss fundamental solutions, in order to gather wisdom and gain benefits. I hope that everyone will offer opinions as much as possible, so that we can discuss them carefully."</p>
<p>Representatives' Reports: After the Chairman's report, the agenda temporarily added "Representatives from each province report on the communist bandit situation." Those who stood up to speak included: (1) Wang Yinxi, representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, reported that since the purge of the Communist Party in Jiangxi Province, the general Communist Party members have dispersed to various villages, lurking and occupying them, and spreading to this day. Except for more than a dozen counties near Nanchang, almost all places are infested with bandits, and Lianhua and other counties are their base areas. Last year, there was a plan to suppress the bandits, but due to Zhang Gui's rebellion, various constraints were imposed, and it could not be implemented. However, in the past, their forces were scattered, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, making it difficult to suppress them. Now, it is only necessary to mobilize a large force, encircle and suppress them together, and wipe them out in one fell swoop, which should not be difficult. After the elimination, Jiangxi Province will be used as the center to clear up all the groups. (2) Lu Xiaochen, representative of the Ninth Route Army Headquarters, reported that the communist bandits' combat actions were extremely unpredictable, taking advantage of weaknesses. Their organization includes the Red Army, Young Pioneers, and Red Guards. However, the internal dictatorship is extremely cruel, and there are many who escape. How to mobilize the attacking bandit suppression troops must be carefully planned. (3) Yu Xiangsan, representative of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, reported that Commander-in-Chief He was deeply saddened by the Changsha massacre and the devastation of Pingliu. This time, he vowed to use all his strength to suppress the communist bandits. No matter how much sacrifice is made, it will not be spared. (4) Wu Xingya, representative of the Hubei Provincial Government, reported that since the purge of the Communist Party in Hubei Province, the communist bandit forces have been more scattered. However, due to the rebellion of Zhang Gui, Feng Tangchou, Hubei Province was the military center, and the troops were transferred to other places, which was not enough for distribution. Communist Party members in various places either fled from Hunan and Jiangxi or took the opportunity to reappear, leading to the current phenomenon. However, it is no longer as deeply rooted as before. The Red Guards are mostly coerced. Every time they arrive at a place, they force the people to accept their conditions. Otherwise, they will burn and kill, and the people have no choice but to follow. Moreover, the Communist Party members active in various villages and districts are mostly unemployed youth and retired unemployed soldiers, who are blindly following under the anesthesia of their leaders. A precise method should be studied to unite the party, government, and military to achieve a thorough clarification. (5) Ouyang Xin, representative of the Newly Compiled 22nd Division, reported on the bandit suppression process of the 22nd Division.</p>
<p>Proposed Matters: Liu Wendao, representative of the Hankou Municipal Government, proposed that if comrades have any opinions, please submit a proposal tomorrow for a full vote. In addition, the general outline and regulations for the implementation of bandit suppression in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi will be discussed on the 28th. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Compilation of Proposals: The proposals submitted by the representatives to the conference include those from the Jiangxi Provincial Party Department and the Wuhan Garrison Command. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Department proposed eight items: (1) How should the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi handle joint defense and work together to encircle and suppress and thoroughly eliminate communist bandits? (2) At this time of large-scale suppression of communist bandits, a large amount of money is needed. However, the finances of the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi are exhausted due to the communist bandits. It is difficult to cope. How should the expenses of the bandit suppression troops and the police teams of various provinces be determined and funds raised to facilitate bandit suppression? (3) At this time, communist bandits are lurking, and rural disaster victims are displaced. How should the county governments handle the clearing of villages, resettle the displaced, and promote industry to enrich the people's livelihood and eliminate the root of communist bandits?

<h3>He Jian Plans to Annihilate Zhu De and Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>Shortening the Defense Line to Induce Them to Go Deep</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Communist bandits Peng Dehuai, Kong Hechong, and others captured Changsha on the 27th of last month, resulting in an unprecedented catastrophe. He Jian mobilized all of the Fourth Route Army, a total of four divisions and one independent brigade, and recovered Changsha on August 5. He personally supervised the various troops and divided them into three routes to advance toward Liuyang to suppress the bandits. It was originally intended to eliminate the Peng bandits in a short period of time. Currently, the frontline troops have reached the vicinity of the bandit nest in Dazhangshan Gold Cave on the border of Jiangxi. Just as they were about to meet with the friendly forces of Jiangxi and Hubei to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression, Zhu De and Mao Zedong suddenly fled east from Shanggao, Jiangxi, to Wanzai, invaded the Xiang border of Liuyang, Dongmen City, and Dahu, and directly attacked Liuyang. They also colluded with Huang Gonglue's two groups, detoured from Lianhua Yichun around Pingxiang, invaded the Xiang border of Liunan, and attacked the flanks of the Fourth Route Army in Chenjiaxia and Wenjiashi to support the Peng bandits. As a result, Dai Douyuan's troops on the right flank were taken advantage of by the bandits. He Jian, due to the sudden increase in the number of bandit groups and the thin troop strength along the Zhupingchang Railway line, feared that there would be negligence, so on the 22nd, he ordered the entire line to retreat to the Jiaoxiling area west of Liuyang (about one hundred li from Changsha) to concentrate troops and lure the bandits into the plains in order to annihilate their main force and dissolve the coerced followers, with the intention of eliminating them in one fell swoop. He's headquarters moved to Yongan City on the same day (sixty li from Changsha) to facilitate command. On the one hand, all the reserve troops were reinforced to the right flank to maintain the new position, and on the other hand, Baoqing's 16th Division, Peng Weiren's and Zhang Liangji's brigades, and the 19th Division's section of Duan Heng's troops stationed in Hengzhou were quickly sent to Zhuzhou and Changsha in preparation for reinforcements. Subsequently, according to intelligence reports, the communist bandit Peng Dehuai's group went out of Changshou Street to Xianzhong, trying to attack Pingliu. Kong Hechong's group returned to attack Shegang City in northern Liuyang, and Li Hangshi's group returned to attack Sunjiaxia in northern Liuyang, uniting with Zhu De and Mao Zedong to disturb Liuchang. Huang Gonglue's group detoured from Liunan to Changzhu, attempting to flee to Changsha. Therefore, on the 24th, he again ordered the frontline troops to withdraw to the line of Yongan City, sixty li from Changsha. He Jian's headquarters moved to Lishi, thirty li from Changsha, making the bandits leave their nests far away. On the one hand, he telegraphed He Yingqin to transfer the Jiangxi friendly army Zhang Huizan's troops to quickly exit Tonggu Wanzai and pursue the rear of the bandits, and ordered Luo Lin's division in Pingjiang and Gong Bingfan's division in Yuezhou to advance in Pingliu, attacking the bandit's flanks, and requested additional aircraft and bombs to assist in the suppression. At the same time, the public regiments elected representatives from the Chamber of Commerce Wei Zhenbang, the Education Association Hu Yiru, and the Post-Disaster Committee Zhao Heng to go to Hankou on the 25th and petition the headquarters with their fellow villagers in Hankou. It is heard that Director He Yingqin has agreed to immediately order Luo Lin's division to quickly open Changsha from Pingjiang to reinforce it, and ordered Gong Bingfan's division to concentrate Yuezhou from Jianli Shishou and quickly open Liuchang, flanking the Peng bandits, Xie Bin's division detouring from Tongcheng to Pingliu, and the Teaching Division Qian Dajun's troops to wait for orders between Yuezhou and Changsha, and added two aircraft carrying bombs to Xiang to assist in the suppression. If necessary, He will also come to Xiang to command military affairs. The citizens of Changsha have received this news today, and people's hearts have been slightly stabilized. (August 26th)</p>
<h3>Eighth Route Army Moves to Attack Binyang</h3>
<p>Yunnan Representative Lu Lei Comes to Guangdong to Request Military Pay</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The war in Guangxi Province has recently shifted its focus to the Dahe River, taking a defensive posture towards the Fuhe River. Since the 15th and 16th, the Eighth Route Army Headquarters has been setting up defensive works on Baiyun Mountain in Wuzhou. The northwest of Wu is dangerous, so electric nets are laid. At the same time, troops are also deployed and defenses are set up in Limguk and Lezhu. After the rear defense was properly arranged, heavy troops were sent out of the Dahe River. The vanguard troops went straight up the river. Chen Jitang, commander of the Eighth Route Army, personally inspected the troops in Pingnan a few days ago. It was decided to attack Binyang first in order to cut off the traffic between Liuzhou and Nanning. It is heard that the Eighth Route Army Headquarters has a limited number of days to attack Binyang in order to help the Yunnan Army directly attack Liuzhou. As for the Yunnan Army entering Guangxi, the plan to advance has been changed. Because the Eighth Route Army has moved to attack Binyang, if Binyang is broken, Nanning can be taken without attacking. Therefore, the Yunnan Army is now abandoning the attack on Yongyuan, and the two divisions of Lu Han and Zhang Chong are crossing Wuyuan to join the attack on Binyang, while Zhu Xu's troops are left to defend Longzhou. This time, the Yunnan Army entered Guangxi and stayed for a long time. Although Nanning has not been captured, it has made every effort to support the Central Government. Recently, there have been rumors that the Yunnan Army entering Guangxi has left-leaning news. In order to clarify the Yunnan Army, Long Yun specially sent Lu Yafu, director of the Yunnan Police Bureau, and Lei Song, secretary of the Provincial Government Office, to Guangdong. Lu and Lei arrived in the province yesterday. According to Lu, the Yunnan Army entered Guangxi with a total of four divisions, purely to support the Central Government in suppressing the rebellion. The rumor that the Yunnan Army is leaning left is absolutely unfounded. The fact that Zhang Chong's division of the Yunnan Army has been besieging Nanning in recent days can prove this. Recently, Lu Han and Zhu Xu will move their troops to join the attack on Binliu. Once Binliu is taken, Nanning will have no problem. However, Yunnan Province has always been known for its poverty. Now, with four divisions of troops on a long expedition to Guangxi, there is bound to be hesitation regarding the supply of military pay. Although the military pay for the Yunnan Army was promised to be allocated by the Central Government, the Central Government is currently coping with the Northwest and is unable to fulfill its wishes. Therefore, it is best for Guangdong to supply the military pay for the 10th Route Army entering Guangxi. The biggest task for me to come to Guangdong this time is to solve the military expenses for the 10th Route Army entering Guangxi. This point has been discussed with Chairman Chen Mingzhu once. Chairman Chen meant that this is a military matter and should be discussed with Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang. Therefore, I will transfer from Guangzhou to Wu in the next few days to discuss everything with Commander Chen." (August 23rd)</p>
<h3>Continuous Bombings in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Only One Suspicious Teenager Was Caught</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The discovery of landmines on the Beining Road, the explosion of bombs in the Southern City, and the search for bombs in Runanli, Fuzhou Road, Special Zone 1 have been detailed in previous letters. However, these terrifying incidents have been emerging one after another. At around 8:00 p.m. on the 21st, someone threw a bomb in front of the gate of Hebei Middle School, next to the Garrison Command. With a loud bang, the whole city was shaken. Fortunately, no one was injured. The entire military police and gendarmerie were dispatched, traffic was cut off, and a search was conducted all night, but nothing was gained. At 8:00 p.m. on the 22nd, someone threw a bomb directly in front of the Garrison Command. The sound was very loud, and the window frames of nearby butchers were shaken. Two people were injured in the blast, one with a damaged buttocks and the other with a broken leg bone. The sounds of mourning and wailing were chilling to hear. The Garrison Command only had twenty-four guards. Hearing the sound of the bomb, they looked at each other in dismay. They quickly used the telephone to summon a large number of bandit soldiers and police from various places. Traffic was immediately cut off and a large-scale search was carried out. A teenager wearing a Zhongshan suit in a nearby barbershop ran away when he heard the sound. The police and gendarmerie, suspecting him, arrested him and handed him over to the military law office for severe interrogation. Whether he confessed or not is still unknown, and his name has not been announced. It was not until after 9:00 p.m. that the citizens' frightened souls had calmed down when they heard loud noises again, one after another, one at the north end of Wuma Road and two near the new station, none of which injured anyone. At 9:00 a.m. today (the 23rd), a bomb exploded again in Hebei. Traffic was immediately cut off and a search was carried out. The trams in the walled city were also ordered to stop. People were panicked. It was not until 12:00 p.m. that traffic was restored. Military agencies are keeping this strictly secret and have not been able to find out the truth. According to general speculation, these bombs disrupting order are actually planned and organized, and in this current situation, it is feared that it will only intensify. (August 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Press Storm Subsides</h3>
<p>The Chongqing press held a general strike on August 5 due to the incident of the soldiers repeatedly destroying the Xishu Evening News, waiting for the government to resolve it properly. Later, the press believed that the strike had been going on for a week, but the government had not made any statement. Therefore, on the 12th, the press as a whole organized a strike committee, issued a declaration, and requested support from the press in various places. At the same time, more than 50 civil groups in the city established a support association for the press strike to provide strong assistance. The government side was afraid of the expansion of the storm and the name of destroying public opinion. Therefore, Lan Wenbin, the commander of the 21st Army, came forward and hosted a banquet for the press on the 15th. The commander of the city defense and the adjutant of each department were also present. During the banquet, Lan Wenbin explained everything, stating: "The press strike for the incident of the destruction of the Xishu Evening News has lasted for more than ten days. Chongqing is a mix of Chinese and foreigners, and it concerns the public opinion. It has resulted in no newspapers being published for more than ten days. The news from all sides is unusually isolated, and it is inevitable that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to spread rumors. The press has the responsibility to lead the society and should resume work as soon as possible. As for the issue of security, brothers and the city defense department and the adjutant of each department are willing to take full responsibility to ensure that there is no danger." Therefore, a riot that shook the sky temporarily calmed down due to these few empty words. On the 18th, all newspapers and news agencies resumed publication. At the same time, the newspapers posted notices stating that the association and others believed that the incident of the Xishu Evening News being captured was a matter of great concern to the safety of the press as a whole and the public security of the society. Therefore, after the joint meeting, it was decided to strike unanimously in order to resolve it as soon as possible. The authorities have now issued an order to arrest the murderers and ensure the future. After a meeting yesterday, it was decided to resume work from today. This is a special announcement.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Various Industries Oppose Telephone Price Increase: Various industries and merchants in Suzhou, in order to increase the price of each call by two yuan by the telephone bureau from September 1, sent a letter to the General Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Ministry of Communications to postpone the increase. After receiving a reply yesterday, it was difficult to approve. The Chamber of Commerce is now scheduled to convene a general meeting of representatives from various industries on the afternoon of the 30th to discuss everything. Thorough Investigation of the Case of Insult by the Commander of the Jiangyin Defense Regiment: Wu Zengshan, President of the Wujin County Court, submitted a report to the High Court stating that Cao Xiangfang, Commander of the Jiangyin Defense Regiment, proposed at the Wucheng Joint Defense Conference that the Wujin County Court connived with bandits and harmed the people, referring to the court as an insurance company for bandits, etc. The commander of the defense regiment was unfamiliar with the truth of the court's handling of cases and arbitrarily insulted him. He requested that the matter be investigated and handled according to law, etc. After President Lin received the report, he specially appointed Liu Zhixi yesterday (28th) to go to Wujin to investigate the truth, and ordered County Magistrate Li of Jiangyin to thoroughly investigate whether Pu Xiangfang raised the proposal at the Wucheng Joint Defense Conference in order to interrogate it.</p>
<p>The Trial of the Counter-Revolutionary Case is Postponed: Zuo Boyi and Li Zhen, students of Cheng Lie Physical Education School, were handed over to the High Court by the Public Security Bureau last month on suspicion of counter-revolution. Prosecutor Zhu Jun investigated and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday (28th), Huang Yandao, the Presiding Judge of the Third Criminal Court, tried the case. Because Zhang Ding, the defense lawyer of Zuo and Li, had not reported, the court ordered the trial to be postponed. Details of the Sealing of the Suzhou Social Daily: The Suzhou Social Daily was founded by Zhou Zhongji, who served as the manager himself. A total of 468 issues were published until the 27th. Recently, Zhou, with no intention of operating it, transferred it to the editor-in-chief, Lu Yiran. At the same time, all the machinery and property were reorganized into Hengxing Printing House. The Social Daily was moved from the Eastern Market to the Huayan Temple at the East Entrance of Jingde Road. It had just moved in on the evening of the 27th. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon of that day, the Public Security Bureau received an order from the County Government, which roughly stated that the Provincial Government approved the letter from the Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee, stating that the Suzhou Social Daily reprinted Shanghai newspaper telegrams, hoping to hear rumors and should be transferred to investigate and seal up the report. After receiving the order, the Public Security Bureau, seeing that the Social Daily had a moving advertisement, knew that it had moved to the East Entrance of Jingde Road. The area was under the jurisdiction of the First Branch Bureau, so it ordered Pan Mingzhi, the Director of the First Branch Bureau, to comply and report. Director Pan reported to the Public Security Bureau that he could not find the address of the Social Daily at Bianguan. Director Zou then ordered the Inspectorate to transfer Xu Shulian, the Director of the Second Branch Bureau, to go to the original address of the library in the East Hongqiao of Dongzhong City to investigate and deal with it. At 10:00 p.m. that night, Xu led the bureau members Xu Baogang, the external affairs Officer Weng Patrol Chief, and five policemen. The County Party Department also sent the Secretary Office staff member Mr. Zhu to go with them and meet Zhou Zhongji, the former manager of the newspaper. According to the report, the newspaper has moved to Huayan Temple. Director Xu and others then went to Huayan Temple and met Wang Xunxiang, the patrol officer of the Fourth Precinct of the First Branch Bureau, and learned that the Social Daily had just moved into the temple on that day. The signboard was hung up at 6:00 p.m. that evening. Then they went inside for inspection. At that time, there were four or five staff members of the newspaper sorting out the manuscripts. All the manuscripts and review rules were checked. There were no reactionary</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Please Investigate the Doctor for Causing Death: In the northern countryside of Wuxi, the local villagers were talking about Tan Arong's daughter, Qinxiu (17 years old). A few days ago, she suddenly suffered from heatstroke and felt slight pain in her abdomen. Arong immediately went to the city to invite Zhang Shaoxi, a Chinese and Western doctor from under the Three Bridges outside the North Gate, to come to the countryside for treatment. The doctor mixed medicine with water and used it for an enema. It is said that a large basin of water was poured into her abdomen. The girl's belly swelled up immediately, and she kept crying in pain. Seeing the situation was not good, the doctor made an excuse and left. Arong rushed back to the city and asked the doctor to come back for treatment, but the doctor demanded seven yuan for consultation fees, otherwise he would not care about her life or death. After Arong begged repeatedly, he finally got a dose of medicine for seven jiao of silver, took it home, and gave it to his daughter. Before long, the girl's ears, eyes, mouth, and nose suddenly flowed out a lot of yellow fluid, and she soon died of breathlessness. Tan Arong and his wife were deeply saddened by their daughter's unnatural death. They immediately prepared a coffin and made arrangements for the burial. At the same time, they placed an advertisement in the newspaper, questioning Zhang Shaojin, and sent a letter to the Medical Association, asking for research and assistance, and planned to file a lawsuit with the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>A Smoker Gathers a Crowd to Resist Arrest and Beat Police: Gu Arong, the son of Gu Jinan, the head of the 25th or 26th Tu outside the two gates of the county, is inherently fierce and addicted to opium. A few days ago, the Public Security Bureau received a report and Xu, the director sent inspector Wang Xiezhong, with eight detectives and policemen, to Gu's house in Niushangtou to search. Gu Arong was arrested and a number of opium paraphernalia were found. Unexpectedly, the suspect Gu used his fists to beat the police and called more than a hundred accomplices to surround Wang, the inspector and others, and beat them severely. Then the police fired two shots into the sky as a warning, and the villagers fled. The smoker Gu Arong also jumped into the river to escape. Wang, the inspector immediately led the police into the river and arrested Gu. Along with the evidence, they were sent to the bureau for interrogation. After interrogation, he was transferred to the county government for legal proceedings yesterday.</p>

<p>Bandits Gather Again in the Coastal Reclamation Area: The coastal reclamation area in Huainan was previously harassed by bandits led by Ma Yuren's remnants. The 133rd Brigade repelled them. However, after the 133rd Brigade returned to station in Yanfu, the bandits gathered again, and the harassment was even more severe than before. The representatives of the reclamation area gathered in Tong on the 27th and sent representatives to the province to petition.</p>
<p>Pirates are Rampant in Da'an Port: A group of pirates from Haizhou led by Chen Asan entered the Yangtze River from the outer sea and occupied Da'an Port, causing great disturbances.

Now the Tonghai long-distance telephone line has been cut off by the bandits. The Tonghai county magistrate telegraphed the province to request that troops be sent to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The Kidnapping Case in Yanglaozhuang: At about 7 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 24th), in Yanglaozhuang, a village under the jurisdiction of the county, twenty or thirty bandits suddenly arrived, each armed with guns. They divided into three groups, with one group standing guard at the entrance of the village, the second group distributed at key intersections, prohibiting passing pedestrians, and the third group going to various homes to rob. The robbery lasted for four hours, resulting in heavy losses. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhu Fakuan's 13-year-old eldest son and Chen Changde's 11-year-old only son, instructing the two families to raise 15,000 yuan each within three days to prepare for the ransom. They said they would send someone to contact them at that time. It is now heard that the families are quite anxious because it is difficult to raise such a large sum of money in a short time.</p>
<p>The District Chief is Accused of Extortion: Wu Kai, the district chief of the eighth district of this county, suddenly ordered three district officers, including Xu Rujun, on the night of the 15th to arrest Shen Dejiu, a rural officer from Yufu Township, without any reason, and tied him with ropes. They took him to the Zhenchuan Temple in the seventh district and detained him. Shen Yuxian, a member of the Shen family, together with Shen Maonian, the son of Shen Burong, the head of Yuyu Township, and Wu Yucheng, the head of Manyu Township, went to Zhenchuan to negotiate with the district chief, but were also detained in the temple. As a result, they were extorted 50 yuan. Unexpectedly, this incident caused public outrage. The heads of the districts and the people felt injustice because the district chief detained people for no reason and extorted money. They have now come to the city to jointly file a lawsuit with the county government.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Xue Shi Dies of Illness Before Sentencing: In the case of Xue Shibao from Tangtouqiao, Sihe Township, shooting Xue Picheng, Liu Deming, Huang Wangchun, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, the county government has repeatedly summoned a number of witnesses to conduct a detailed investigation.

After hearing the report, the Civil Affairs Department ordered County Magistrate Li to investigate and reinstate. Director Li asked the director of the Public Security Bureau to reinstate on his own. Director Li said that on that day, the police force happened to be concentrated in the city, and the bandits took advantage of the defense loophole to cause the incident. In addition to requesting self-punishment from the county magistrate, he specially requested reinstatement to be transferred to the department for review and handling.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Li's Resignation is Not Approved: After County Magistrate Li resigned, there was an internal decision in the province to appoint Hong, a secretary from the Zhejiang Construction Department. County Magistrate Li, after seeing the news in the newspaper, reported during the Memorial Week that he had not resigned to the province. The news about Hong from the Civil Affairs Department was probably not accurate. On the 26th, County Magistrate Li went to the province to inquire about everything. However, the news reported was probably from a private letter from the province, or it was not reliable.</p>
<p>Search of Xingchun Primary School: The night before last, Li, the director of the Public Security Bureau, personally led patrol officers and detectives in plain clothes to Xingchun Primary School (located in Leizu Temple in the county) to conduct a search. Then, he went to the home of Zheng Chaoyong, the principal of the school west of Wenfu Bridge, to search. Zheng was not at home, so his father, Zheng Baonan, was taken to the bureau. After questioning, it was determined that he was not involved, so he was released. The reason for the search has not been announced by the Public Security Bureau for the time being. Also, at about 10 a.m. on the 26th, the detective team went to the Minsheng Newspaper and arrested Xu Laowu, who was sending newspapers to Zhouzhuang Township, and detained him in the Public Security Bureau. The reason for the detention is unknown. After a secret interrogation that evening, he was released on bail by the second shop.</p>
<p>Mortgage Silver for Ten Thousand Yuan to Supplement Local Expenses: The Public Funds and Public Property Office, because the end of the month is approaching, and the funds for various agencies have not yet been settled, based on the previous case of the former director, in order to alleviate local expenses, mortgaged 10,000 yuan in silver from the 19th year, with a term of two months. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Finance Bureau to raise funds.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Robbery of a Foreign Yarn Boat in Lushe Town: Lushe Town, which is under the jurisdiction of the 14th District (Yuanhe), belongs to the foreign boundary of Wuxian. At about 8 p.m. the day before yesterday, a large barge loaded with more than 500 bags of foreign yarn was moored there because it was late and could not make the journey. Unexpectedly, while the boat crew was sleeping soundly, the bandits untied the boat cable and parked it in the reed beds of Caozha Dang, about three miles south of the town. They then moved the foreign yarn to a bandit ship. At this time, the boat crew had noticed and shouted loudly, but a bandit threatened them with a gun and forced them into the cabin. After all the foreign yarn was moved away, they set sail and fled. After dawn, the boat crew reported to the local guards, and the boat returned to Shanghai to report to the owner, seeking ways to pursue the bandits.</p>
<p>Details of the Firefight Between Police and Bandits in Xu Liujing: The night before last, a large group of bandits from Xuliujing Bixi City, near Hupu in this county, arrived on four sand boats. After landing, the stationed police and security corps went to investigate, and a firefight broke out between the two sides. The situation was detailed in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a detailed record of the continued reports. After the bandits were driven away from Gulicun by the security corps, they fled to the shore of Xuliujingkou. That night, they robbed the old Xu market town and other places. There were several county police teams in Xuliujing. Squad leader Tang heard the villagers' report and immediately led his troops to prepare and set off. At that time, there were only sixteen police officers. Seeing that there were not many police officers, the bandits became even more rampant and fired their guns continuously. They were carrying several submachine guns. The officers still rushed forward bravely. Chen Zongbao and Wei Zongwang were shot in vital areas and died on the spot. Fu Youcai was hit by a stray bullet and suffered minor injuries. He was sent to Jishan Hospital in the city for treatment, and his life is probably not in danger. The police captain, Qian Mobin, went to the countryside to collect the bodies of the two who had died. Although the police team suffered a small setback, the Xushi merchant corps and the security corps all set off from Xiaoshi Zhoujingkou Xujiaqiao and other places to join the police team. They fought with the bandits for an hour before the bandits could not hold on and withdrew from Xuliujingkou and fled. At that time, there were also some deaths and injuries on the bandit ship, but the bandits dragged them away. The police and security corps still tried their best to chase them, but the river was too wide to advance, so they retreated. When they returned to the team, they checked the weapons and equipment. Five missing squad members from the anti-smuggling camp and five rifles were missing. The police team lost two Mauser pistols. The missing anti-smuggling squad members suddenly returned, but the weapons were gone. The other three have no trace. After receiving the news from the countryside, the city's Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched Inspector Lu Jinchen that night, taking the police chiefs and fifty Mauser pistol teams by steamboat to the area. When they ordered a boat to stop, it did not respond and sailed towards the Jiangbei side. Inspector Lu ordered them to fire, and they went ashore to search the boat. They found the hostages Xia Lianfu, a native of Tingdong Dongshan, and Zhao Genfu. According to Zhao, he was the boatman. The hostages have been taken to the city's Public Security Bureau for questioning before being sent back separately. It was also learned that Li Sisi, the boatman who was pulled away in Gulicun yesterday, escaped after being taken to Baimao Port.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Silk Cocoon Guild Telegraphed Requesting Boycott of Japanese Cocoons: Zhang Ximin, the director of the Jiaxing Silk Cocoon Guild, telegraphed to the Shanghai Jiangsu Zhejiang Anhui Silk Cocoon General Guild and the Silk Cocoon Public Association, requesting a boycott of Japanese cocoons, which are entering Shanghai and seizing the sales channels of Chinese cocoons, and to discuss relief methods. The original telegram is as follows: "The import of Japanese dried cocoons will immediately destroy the Chinese silk cocoon industry. National taxes and commerce are greatly affected. This matter concerns the pain of the industry. We telegraphically request permission to find ways to boycott and prevent imports. This is the common feeling."</p>
<p>Petition to Stop the Provincial Government from Arbitrarily Imposing Additional Taxes: The Jiaxing County Executive Committee stated that each county in Zhejiang has suffered from bandits, wind, insects, water, and drought, and has painfully shouldered various public debts and special donations. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government is adding an additional tax of three jiao of silver per tael to the farmland tax for land consolidation and start-up fees, which is truly disregarding the people's suffering. Therefore, it plans to telegraph the provincial party headquarters to correct it and petition the central government to issue a clear order to stop it in order to relieve the people's distress.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Stricter Inspection of Passengers on Caolu: Wu Conglong, the commander of the 6th Regiment of the Baoding Security Team stationed in Baiguan, ordered the train search soldiers on the trains going back and forth between the two Cao sections to pay special attention to soldiers traveling by train and passengers with suspicious behavior, and to conduct detailed inspections. If there are any suspects, they should be immediately detained and interrogated, because of the conscription officer's collaboration with bandits in Hongtang, which resulted in the death of Lin Yutang, a member of the military police joint detective office, who was shot by bandits.</p>
<p>The Detective Team Captures Two Thieves: Wang Laisheng and Zhang Deqing, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, were patrolling to Yongjiang Inn in Fujia Longtou, Jiangbei, at about 10 p.m. the night before last (the 25th). They found two travelers, Xin Afu and Shen Xingen, whose expressions were flustered and suspicious. When they questioned them, they were evasive, so they took the two to the team for interrogation. Xin Afu confessed that he was a thief and had robbed incense boats with Mao Ayao and others at the Hefeng Yarn Factory. Mao Ayao now lives in the Zhousu ferry factory. Shen Xingen did not participate in the robbery. Captain Yu immediately ordered the detectives to arrest Mao Ayao. Shen Xingen was a legitimate businessman and was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Petition to Stop Public Sales of Fertilizer: In order to rectify income, the Xiaoshan County Government organized a fertilizer sales office and brought all the county's manure under the exclusive management of the office. At the same time, it ordered farmers to cancel all previously established manure yards. After the second administrative meeting, it drafted regulations and submitted them to the Department of Civil Affairs for record. It is now learned that the farmers in various villages believe that the old manure ponds are related to the ancestral business and that taking them away will cause a lot of losses. Moreover, purchasing from the sales office will inevitably increase the burden. They have already petitioned the provincial government to order the suspension of the sales office.</p>
<p>Status of Tobacco Leaf Production and Sales: In Xiaoshan's Four Districts, tobacco production is the main industry. Although this year's harvest has decreased, the price is better than in previous years. Recently, most of the tobacco leaves in the area have been dried, and various tobacco firms have been going to the countryside to purchase them, resulting in a sharp increase in the price of local goods, which has risen to 19.4 yuan per dan. The daily demand for cash is more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Pirates Rob and Kidnap: The Dachang Dry Flower Rice Shop in Malutou, Li Hai Suo, North Township, was raided by more than a dozen pirates who spoke the Yuyao dialect at about 2 a.m. on the 17th. They broke into the shop with long guns, pistols, and other weapons. It happened to be the day after the welcome ceremony for the Erxiang Gong deity in that area, and the Pan Guan Temple nearby was still performing operas. All the shopkeepers had gone out to watch the opera, leaving only Wang Baichun and two other apprentices in the shop. When the pirates entered, they searched everywhere in the money cabinets, accounts drawers, and the bedrooms of various partners. As a result, they stole more than 50 jiao of silver, 12 yuan of banknotes and silver from a partner's private savings, as well as rough and fine single and double clothes. They forced the apprentice Wang Baichun to lead them to Xu Ruyi's house in Tangnei, but failed to find the owner of the shop. They then kidnapped Wang and told Xu Ruyi to send a message to his boss to prepare money for ransom. The next day after the incident, Dachang Shop reported to the county and asked them to send someone to investigate. As late as the 22nd, the shop suddenly received two letters, one from the kidnappers and one from the apprentice Wang Baichun. The kidnappers' letter said that they would send a representative to a certain place in Shanghai on the 28th, wearing a blue cloth long gown, carrying a blue cloth money bag, and wearing white shoes as a signal to discuss the price, but there was no mention of the amount of ransom. Baichun's letter said that he was suffering in the cave and asked to be rescued as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate the Person Responsible for Demolishing the Memorial Archway: The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously received a telegram from Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, stating that because the South Street of this city was widened, the ancient art architecture memorial archway was arbitrarily demolished. He requested that personnel be sent to investigate and that the officials in charge and the engineering designers be punished so that all localities will pay attention to the implementation of construction projects in the future. Yesterday, the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs sent a telegram to the newly appointed County Magistrate Li Guangyu, asking him to quickly investigate and report so that a decision could be made. The original telegram is as follows: President Dai of the Examination Yuan's telegram states (omitted)... In view of this, after checking the regulations on the preservation of famous scenic spots, historical sites, and antiquities, and the law on the preservation of antiquities, which were previously issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the department, they have been separately forwarded to the counties for compliance. The county's expansion of the road and its arbitrary demolition of this ancient art architecture, regardless of its value, is inappropriate for the former county magistrate and the engineering designers. The Department of Civil Affairs has an official seal.</p>
<p>Bandits are Rampant in Guoxiwai: Bandits have been rampant in Guoxiwai, southwest of this city, with kidnapping and looting occurring constantly. At about 10 p.m. on the 25th of this month, more than a dozen bandits, speaking a Hakka dialect and carrying guns, suddenly arrived at the He family in Yangwanli and looted everything. They then went to Li Jinsheng's house in Changqi Village, broke down the door, tied up Jinsheng, burned him with fire, and forced him to hand over silver dollars. All the clothes, jewelry, and other items were stolen.</p>

<p>Confiscated Opium Case in Guabu: Last month, a large amount of opium was discovered in Guabu Town, filling a boat. The Self-Defense Corps learned of this and sent several soldiers to investigate. They opened fire and resisted, resulting in the arrest of Liu Guangzhu, the opium transporter, and eleven large bags of opium. They were taken to the Self-Defense Corps. Afterwards, a report was submitted to the county government, which only amounted to 792 taels. County Magistrate Liu interrogated the opium offender Liu Guangzhu, who confessed that he had obtained 6,470 taels of opium in Hankou and had an invoice for verification. County Magistrate Liu believed that this case was of great importance and pursued the missing opium, but there was no clue. Xiong Zhuangtu and Huang Zhihe, etc. of the town, believing that the Self-Defense Corps and various institutions were dividing the opium among themselves, which was a great harm to the local area, listed the facts and reported them to the county. They were ordered to summon for investigation. Now, Ding Taichen, the director of the Self-Defense Corps, is afraid that the witness Wang Rubin will come to court to testify, which is not convenient for him. So he instigated Zhou Fengzhi, a member of the corps, to intimidate Wang Rubin and order him not to come to court. The future outcome is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate the Embezzlement Case of the County Magistrate: The former County Magistrate of Pinghu, Fang Li, was accused of a case and investigated to be true. The provincial government decided to remove him from office and investigate him. Now, the people of the county have accused him of embezzling funds and engaging in corruption, and have filed a complaint with the provincial government. After receiving the complaint, the provincial government sent Special Commissioner Yang Xiuyan to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Investigate Basic Production: The Zhejiang Construction Department believes that construction is important, but the province's financial resources are limited.

<h3>Ministry of Education Prevents</h3>
<p>Fake Textbooks from Spreading Overly Radical Publications</p>
<p>The Commercial Press Requests Identification of Genuine and Fake</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Bureaus to Separately Prohibit</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the Commercial Press, requests that the textbooks issued by the company be distinguished to prevent overly radical publications under the name of Yi Xuanchuan, and requests a clear identification to avoid misleading. Special instructions are given to the education bureaus of each province and city, saying that the case is based on the report of Li Zhigong, the manager of the Shanghai Commercial Press Co., Ltd., "Our branch in Lanxi reported in June of this year that the county middle school in Dongyang County received a party publication. The cover fraudulently printed the names of textbooks 4 and 5 of the New Era Chinese Language Professor, used by senior elementary schools, and falsely stated that it was sent by the Minzhi Bookstore. The county government was notified and filed a case after review. Later, in July, the same publication was found in this city. Our company immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification. We have now received a report from our branch in Nanjing that the Capital Garrison Command has issued a document prohibiting the distribution of the New Era Chinese Language Professor Book published by our company. Subsequently, we received a report from our branch in Hankou that we have received instructions from the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters, stating that the Chinese Language Professor Book published by the Commercial Press is a reactionary publication and should be prohibited from distribution, etc. After investigation, the content, text, and paper thickness of such publications with fraudulently printed covers are completely different. Once reviewed, the genuine and fake can be distinguished immediately. If the textbook that has been reviewed and approved by the ministry is rashly banned due to this misunderstanding, it will not only be unclear, but it will also have a great impact on the education career. Although our branch has separately submitted reports to clarify the situation, schools may be afraid to adopt this culture if they hear this ban, which will be unthinkable in the future. In order to issue a certificate, we sincerely request that the ministry notify all provinces and institutions to pay attention to distinguishing the genuine and fake in order to avoid misunderstandings and maintain education. We will be waiting for orders." According to this, the sections presented by the museum are true. In addition to the separate orders, the Ministry of Education hereby orders the ministry to earnestly identify the authenticity of the contents of the book and separately prohibit it in order to avoid misunderstandings and fund adoption.</p>

<h3>Document from Suqian Middle School Principal on Robbery</h3>
<p>Su Mingqin, Principal of Jiangsu Provincial Suqian Middle School, submitted a report to the Education Department, stating: This report concerns being robbed en route back to school from Jin Province on official business by subordinates of Huang Meixing, the regimental commander of the 266th Regiment of the 133rd Brigade stationed in Qingjiangpu, falsely accused of being a bandit, severely beaten, paraded through the streets, and losing school funds and the school seal. I respectfully request your review and further submission to the Provincial Government and detailed report to the military officer, earnestly requesting a thorough investigation, strict punishment, compensation for damages, and a strict order to all troops in the province to ensure the safety of public officials, in order to emphasize education and uphold the law. The principal received 1,487 yuan of the school's regular expenses for June from the Jiangsu Bank in Zhenjiang on the 14th of this month. Originally, he intended to remit the funds to Suqian from Zhenjiang, but due to rampant bandits and unrest in Suqian, money houses in Zhenjiang and Suqian had long ceased remittance services. As the start of the school term was approaching, the principal was anxious to return to school and had no choice but to decide to personally carry the cash to Qingjiangpu and find a way to remit it to Suqian from there. He and Chen Hanying, a female teacher from the school, took a steamer from the province on the 18th and arrived in Qingjiangpu (Huaiyin County) around 2:00 PM on the 19th. Upon hiring a rickshaw into the city and reaching the east gate, soldiers stationed at the gate by Huang Meixing of the 266th Regiment of the 133rd Brigade, under the pretext of inspection, arbitrarily insulted and beat the principal and robbed all the cash he was carrying. The situation at the time was extremely dangerous. Teacher Chen witnessed everything from the side, overwhelmed with shock. Fortunately, she dodged quickly and was not insulted. After robbing the school funds, the soldiers falsely accused the principal of being a bandit, dragged him onto the city tower, tied him up, and beat him severely. Then they dragged him down, tied his hands behind his back, and paraded him through the streets, declaring that he would be shot on the spot after the parade. Subsequently, he was taken to a certain company headquarters, where a platoon leader interrogated him and ordered him to hand over the official documents from your department and the school seal for inspection. When taking out the official documents from his bag, he discovered that the school seal was also missing. The entire incident was reported by express telegram on the [blank] day. Recalling the scene when the principal was tied up and paraded through the streets, Wang Shipu, the director of the local orphanage, witnessed it and immediately reported to Magistrate Xu of the Huaiyin County Government, requesting him to vouch for his release to the regimental headquarters. Magistrate Xu was shocked upon hearing the news, but fearing the power of the regiment, he dared not come forward alone to vouch for him. He instructed to invite Han Yanmen, the principal of Huaiyin Agricultural School, to go together to vouch for him. By the time Magistrate Xu and others were preparing to depart, the principal had already been expelled. After being humiliated, the principal originally intended to return to the regiment headquarters to reason with them, but Jin Renjie, the manager of the Qingjiangpu Daoshu Library, and Si Daoping, the head of affairs of Huaiyin Agricultural School, also rushed to vouch for him, strongly advising the principal to leave the area in front of the regiment headquarters as soon as possible to avoid further unexpected incidents. The principal had no choice but to leave the company headquarters and go directly to Dr. Xu Muhu's clinic in Zhao Family Building in the city to have his injuries examined. The injury report and Dr. Xu's business card (Dr. Xu used to practice in Shanghai, hence the words "Shanghai Hongkou Hospital" on the injury report) are attached hereafter for your review. I humbly believe that the military law and discipline of our National Revolutionary Army have always been strict and clear. Now, a troop directly under the Central Government, responsible for defending the territory and protecting the people, actually robs and injures people, acting like bandits, disregarding the law to such an extent. This is something that even warlords and bandits cannot surpass, let alone what should exist under the bright sky of the Revolutionary Army. The principal's personal body and life are originally insignificant, but as an education official, a principal of a middle school commissioned by the province, traveling on official business, to be subjected to such an unexpected disaster and great humiliation for no reason, it is difficult to speak of the sanctity of education in his career, and how can the principal be a role model for others? After repeated consideration, the principal ultimately decided that as the school term was approaching, he could not shirk his responsibility and could only temporarily endure the humiliation, treat his injuries, and work hard despite his illness. However, the school seal was issued by the provincial government, and the school funds are for public use. In order to maintain the prestige of the provincial government and your department and to realize the fact that the school will open, there are several matters that must be earnestly requested of your department to be forwarded to the provincial government and detailed to the military officer for strict compliance: (1) Please investigate and deal with the criminal offenses of Huang Gexing, the regimental commander of the 266th Regiment of the 133rd Brigade, for condoning his subordinates in robbing public funds and injuring public officials. (2) Please severely punish all the perpetrators who tied up and beat the principal that day. (3) Please set a time limit for recovering the stolen school seal. (4) Please set a time limit for recovering the stolen regular expenses of the school, amounting to 1,487 yuan. (5) Please order the regimental commander to immediately compensate the principal for all medical expenses incurred as a result of the injuries. (6) Please strictly order all troops stationed in various parts of Jiangsu Province to treat education officials equally in the future and not to insult or offend them in any way. The above are all the circumstances of the principal's [blank] incident, proposed [blank] and [blank] six matters, besides [blank] long, and [blank] except, should be prepared in writing report, humbly</p>
<p>, And requested to be forwarded to the Provincial Government and submitted to the military officer for review and indication, Chen, head of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, is hereby submitted, with attached Xiao Ming's injury report and Dr. Xu's business card, one each. Su Ming, Principal of Jiangsu Provincial Suzao Middle School,</p>

<h3>New Budget for the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau Finalized</h3>
<p>Classes Have Begun in All Schools</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau previously ordered all schools in the city to start school on the 22nd and classes on the 25th. The schools felt inconvenienced in hiring teachers and handling administrative matters due to the fact that the new budget for the 19th year had not yet been announced. Therefore, they jointly submitted a request to the Education Bureau the day before yesterday to finalize the new budget as soon as possible so that they could comply. After consultations between the principals of the schools and Zhang Zhongdao, the director of the Education Bureau, a decision was made to implement the budget according to the original plan and the distribution of funds would be determined by each school based on the actual situation, subject to approval by the bureau for record-keeping. Upon receiving this news, all schools happily started classes on the 27th.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Beijing Municipal Principals' Joint Meeting held an extraordinary meeting on the [26th]. The principals of the schools proposed that since the new budgets for the schools had been decided and could not be changed, could adjustments be made to the items? It was resolved that the amount of the new budget for each school could not be changed, but adjustments to the items could be made as appropriate according to the budget table, subject to approval by the bureau for implementation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>Establishing a Middle School, Government Only Agrees to Subsidize</p>
<p>The Japanese residents of this city plan to establish a middle school. Mr. He Duan, the chairman of the administrative committee of the Japanese Residents Association, returned to his country to request funding from the government. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has only agreed to subsidize the regular expenses and has approved its inclusion in next year's budget. After two years of efforts, the government has only given verbal approval, and it is still uncertain whether the Ministry of Finance will approve it next year. Regarding the school building, the Tongwen Academy, elementary school, or vocational school buildings can be temporarily borrowed. However, the construction of school buildings will still be an urgent matter in the future as the number of students increases, and there is no source for the school building fund. Therefore, it is very uncertain whether the Japanese middle school will be able to open next year.</p>
<h3>Occupational Guidance Institute Organizes the Joint Occupational Guidance Association</h3>

<h3>Municipal First Experimental Elementary School Building a New School Building</h3>
<p>The site of the Municipal First Experimental Elementary School on Penglai Road in this city was originally on Songdi Street in Ximen. It was founded in 1928 and admitted ordinary children. The school buildings were rented from civilian houses, which were quite unsuitable. Therefore, in 1929, it was moved to the Municipal Public School Park on Xueqian Street, Penglai Road. The plan was also changed to experiment with the education of gifted children. The natural environment was excellent, and the houses were more suitable than before, but there were not many rooms, which was insufficient for allocation, and the experimental plan could not be fully implemented. Subsequently, the school submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau to build a school building in the southern corner of the school's playground. The Municipal Education Bureau then submitted a joint report with the Municipal Works Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval. The construction plan was approved at the 212th technical meeting on May 15th to build a three-story cement洋房 building, which is expected to have five classrooms, with the remaining rooms for the principal's office, reception room, library, laboratory, teacher's dormitory, etc. The construction cost is expected to reach more than 20,000 yuan. Construction began on the 24th of this month and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. When school starts next semester, not only can more new students be admitted, but also the experimental plan can be gradually realized.</p>

<h3>Evening Evening</h3>
<p>Japanese Team Narrowly Defeats Hong Kong Ping Pong Team</p>
<p>Tonight Hong Kong Plays Golden Star and Guangdong Women's Teams</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM last night, the Hong Kong team made its fourth appearance, competing against the Shanghai Japanese Ping Pong Team at the Jande Association. That evening, there was thunder and torrential rain, but the number of guests was still as large as in previous days, showing that there are indeed people who are passionate about ping pong. When the clock struck nine, the referee Shinobu Manabe gave a silver signal, and the sounds of "Saika-li" (i.e., effort) resounded in all directions. The results are detailed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Japanese Team Result Winner</p>
<p>Chen Yingting Matsuda 1|3 Japan</p>
<p>Deng Yaopeng Tsuda 2|3 Japan</p>
<p>Huang Pingwu Hirano 2|3 Japan</p>
<p>Huo [blank] Ting Yanoi 3|0 Hong Kong</p>
<p>Zeng Yingfu Ogura 3|0 Hong Kong</p>
<p>Mo Qinghuan Soda 3|2 Hong Kong</p>
<p>Feng Wenda Watanabe 1|3 Japan</p>
<p>According to the reporter's observations, the Japanese team excels at drawing the ball, attacking left and right, and being close to the opponent's [blank] end, making it extremely difficult to return the ball. The Hong Kong team is good at defending the ball, but unfortunately, it is close to the middle of the court, making it easy to be attacked by the opponent. Although they sometimes use attacking techniques, they are mostly powerless. According to those who are proficient in this field, the Hong Kong team's technique is not inferior to any strong team. The failure is mostly due to the team's poor racket-holding method, making it difficult to draw the ball and lacking in variations. It is said that the Hong Kong team's match against the Japanese team last night was their first time.</p>
<h3>Tonight Hong Kong Plays Golden Star and Guangdong Women's Teams</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Champion Ping Pong Team is scheduled to compete against the Shanghai Golden Star Ping Pong Team, one of the strongest teams, in the first match at 8:00 PM tonight, and against the Guangdong Women's Ping Pong Team, famous throughout Shanghai, in the second match. The location is still the Jande Association gym. The Golden Star Ping Pong Team is organized by members of the Golden Star Exchange. Renowned players such as "Taffy" Wu Faqing, "Iron Wall" Wang Jingen, and the newly famous Hu Baochu, Ye Quangen, Xiao Rangtian, etc., are all strong players. Since hearing of the arrival of the Hong Kong team, the Guangdong women have been practicing day and night, and players such as Li Ruifen, Lin Murong, and Lin Muzhao have high hopes of winning. Because the Hong Kong attack method is different from that of Shanghai, they have suffered losses and consecutive defeats to the Jande Tianma, but since the match against the Japanese team yesterday, they have given great consideration to their tactics. Therefore, the outcome of tonight's match is unpredictable.</p>
<p>In addition, Ping Pong expert Yu Binqi is a member of the Golden Star Team, but he is also a member of the Tianma Team. Since he has already represented Tianma, it is still uncertain whether he will be able to attend tonight.</p>

<p>Customer: Waiter, look. How come this crab is missing a claw? And I love to eat claws the most.</p>
<p>Waiter: Sir, because our crabs are especially fresh today. When we put them in the pot, they were still fighting each other. So some of them had their claws knocked off.</p>
<p>Customer: So the ones with the claws knocked off are the losers. Bring me the winners.</p>

<p>Girl B: This is a foreign custom. White is a symbol of happiness. And the wedding day is the happiest day of a woman's life.</p>
<p>Girl A: Ah, so white is a symbol of happiness. Then black is a symbol of unhappiness. Why does the groom have to wear a black formal suit?</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Barbers and the Nation</h3>
<p>— Wu Zhuo</p>
<p>In the past, our country mostly regarded barbers as a lowly profession. Therefore, they were forbidden from taking civil service exams. They were almost not treated as ordinary citizens. Little did people know that during the Qing Dynasty, those who shaved the emperor's head were designated as Hanlin Academy Attendants, included in the extremely prestigious Hanlin Academy. This was because during the previous Ming Dynasty, everyone kept their hair long. When the Qing people entered the pass, they ordered everyone to shave their heads. People missed the old ruler, and generally believed that shaving one's head was a barbarian custom, and that barbers were traitors. This hatred led to their being looked down upon. In reality, they earned their living through manual labor. They were truly self-reliant. Why should they be considered lowly?</p>
<p>The Qing people, realizing that the people were mostly unwilling to shave their heads and looked down on the profession, gave barbers extreme and empty glory, and extremely high power. They ordered that a flagpole be erected in front of every barber shop. (During the Qing Dynasty, erecting a flagpole was an extremely glorious affair. Only those who passed the civil service exams were allowed to erect one. However, those who passed the exams had two flagpoles, while barbers had one.) A yellow flag was hung on the flagpole, with the words "By Imperial Decree, Shave Heads" written on it. Those who disobeyed would be beheaded. The people, filled with awe, all obeyed. Later, the barber's tools still followed the old system, with a small flagpole carved on them, with a piece of red cloth hanging on it, for the use of the sharp razor. People no longer knew where it came from.</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a certain emperor in France (whose name is now lost) who went to a barber shop for a haircut and encountered an assassin. A barber sacrificed himself to save the emperor. Afterwards, the emperor, considering his loyalty to the country, gave him special honor, ordering him to be buried wrapped in the national flag. Later, all barber shops envied his glory and competed to use the national flag as a shroud. Therefore, the barber shops now all have red, blue, and white spirals at the entrance. People are used to it and don't think about it, only knowing that it is the symbol of a barber shop, without investigating its origin. Our country's barber shops also blindly imitate it. They truly don't know why.</p>
<p>The reporter notes: The latter statement comes from the research of a friend of the reporter. It is definitely not conjecture. If we look at the "Excelsior" used at the entrance of barber shops today, it is a French word, and the three colors are also spirals. This proves that it is not wrong. The national flags of various countries are very important. Without great merit, one cannot hang the national flag. Our country's five-color national flag was used everywhere in the past, even in front of brothels, and on the shoes of prostitutes. People only knew to use it for aesthetic purposes, without knowing that it insulted the national emblem. I knew long ago that it could not last. Today's blue sky with a white sun, I deeply hope that the people will respect it, to understand the difficulty of the late Premier in creating the nation. I also hope that people will be more careful about items with the Zhongshan brand. This is my greatest hope.</p>
<h3>Going to France</h3>
<p>— Hong Xiao</p>
<p>We who live in the British Concession often hear this phrase: "Going to France." Those who have just arrived in Shanghai will definitely misunderstand it as traveling across the ocean to France. In reality, it means going to the French Concession. This phrase is not limited to the non-intellectual class. Even those who are obviously intellectuals say it this way. It has almost become a mantra. Once they get used to saying it, it just rolls off the tongue. I remember someone discussing in the newspaper before that Chinese people who live in the British Concession often write "British Concession, such-and-such road, such-and-such" on the envelope in their letters, rarely writing in detail as "British Concession." They unknowingly abandon the sovereignty of the British Concession, and in effect admit that this piece of land is no longer national territory, but belongs to Britain. The laziness of saving a word is a minor matter. However, if we compare this to "Going to France," then we feel that the latter is more serious than the former. Simply writing "British Concession" is ultimately saving a stroke, and one still knows in one's heart that it is a concession. "Going to France" directly regards the French Concession as French territory, as if one doesn't know that it is a concession at all. But no one has ever noticed this. This afternoon, hearing this phrase, I suddenly felt something and specially wrote it out, hoping that the people will correct it. It is best to change it to "Going to the French Concession."</p>
<h3>More on the Bandit Atmosphere in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>— Hong Xiao</p>
<p>I previously reported on the bandit disaster in Rugao, where the Shizhuang Town Public Security Bureau defeated a large number of communist bandits with a small number of policemen. The bureau chief, Mr. Song Yifu, was loved and respected by the merchants and residents there, who relied on him as a mountain. It was truly because Song was there that the bandits, although powerful, could be contained. However, Song, training the police and maintaining vigilance day and night, had been doing this for months, which inevitably affected his health. Moreover, since the defeat, the bandits declared that the police in other areas had no resistance, only Shizhuang Town suffered a setback, and this revenge would be avenged. Song was not afraid of this. He was already aware that the communists would retaliate, but he did not expect that despite the precautions, the supply of rations and ammunition would be greatly lacking, to the point that he could not issue rations at the end of the month, and there was no way to maintain it. The communist bandits then carried out their revenge at this time, launching a large-scale attack. The police, although understanding the great righteousness, could not serve the public on an empty stomach. Without ammunition, they were powerless. Therefore, Shizhuang Town unfortunately suffered bandit burning and looting. Song resigned twice, but was not approved. In this time of terror, everyone regarded it as a dangerous path, and it was difficult to find a successor. However, if Song stayed, there was nothing he could do. After the looting, more and more people moved away, making it even more difficult to raise rations. Song has now come to Shanghai, and will go to Zhenjiang, saying that even a clever woman cannot cook without rice, and moreover, he is ill and can no longer take care of the requests of the local people to stay. He has firmly submitted his resignation, only leaving one or two bureau members to hand over the work, and will not return to his post. In recent years, the bandit atmosphere in Jiangbei has been rampant, and its spread is alarming. Almost every county has some area that has fallen into the hands of bandits, as if the officials and bandits are dividing the rule, and the officials can do nothing. In my Taizhou, more than a hundred villages have been occupied by bandits, who are rampant and abnormal. Within the bandit area, everyone is a bandit. Among them, there are certainly those who are threatened by the bandits and have no choice but to do so. The provincial public security brigade once went to suppress them, but when they arrived, they did not see a single bandit. They suspected that the repeated calls for help from the people of Taizhou were unwarranted disturbances. The brigade soldiers were in groups of three or five, walking around leisurely. In a blink of an eye, the farmers plowing the fields, the workers operating in the square, the people carrying burdens, and those selling odds and ends all abandoned their farm tools and replaced them with sophisticated firearms. They were all bandits. The brigade was caught off guard and all were disarmed. After that, they did not dare to mention suppression again. Moreover, the bandits are cruel and hate public officials. Those who meet them will not be able to return alive. And the method of death is particularly inhumane. My close friend, Mr. Wang Tigang (Qian), assisted in collecting a certain tax. The organization was located near the bandit area. One day, he was escorting funds to the city when he suddenly encountered bandits. They took him away and dismembered him. Afterwards, his younger brother Kun offered a reward of two hundred yuan for his remains, but they could not be found. Recently, I learned of this from a fellow villager who came to Shanghai, and I could not help but shed tears. The bandit disaster is like this. In each of the counties of my Jiangbei, we can not avoid the tragedy of "Xiangcheng without a living soul." Alas!</p>
<h3>A Little Knowledge of Luosu</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Lu Zhu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read a newspaper and saw Mr. Cao Zixiu record his childhood experience of eating Luosu. He was afraid of its greasiness, and tears fell with his chopsticks. It was very interesting. I have often examined it. Luosu is eggplant. It is produced everywhere. Its color is purple, so it is also called Kunlun Purple Gourd. However, there are also light green ones. The shapes are also different. The common ones are shaped like potatoes. The ones produced in Haiyan County are long and slightly curved, tender and seedless, and of the highest quality. The ones produced in Pinghu County are round like balls, of the next quality. The villagers boast that they are a special kind. I have traveled to few places, so I do not know if there are similar ones in other places. The ones sold in the Shanghai vegetable stalls are thick, long and straight, like Wang melons. Although I have not tasted them, I guess they must not be good. As for what Cao Zi said, there are flat and round ones, but I have not seen one to this day. The cooking method is either fried, steamed, or mixed with minced ginger and salt and stewed with mackerel. The taste is all fatty and rich. In ancient times, it was called Luosu because it was fatty and greasy like cheese. If it is eaten raw pickled in sauce, it is of low quality. However, there are not a few who like it. There is a town in my county called Xindai, which specializes in making soy sauce eggplant. Before pickling it in soy sauce, it is pickled in salt to make it soft, and then squeezed to make it flat. The reason for this is to allow the bitter juice to come out of the stem, and also to allow the soy sauce to enter from the stem. If it is not made properly, it will have a bitter taste. This is why Xindai soy sauce eggplant is famous far and wide. I love to eat eggplant the most in my life. When I see it wasted, I always sigh and regret it. I once read a note about a madman who liked to eat duck tails. His neighbor was a wealthy family. They slaughtered many ducks every day and discarded their tails. Someone would always sigh, even stomp their feet and scold loudly. It was spread as a joke. Love comes from the heart, and the emotion cannot be suppressed. Some say that Luosu is poisonous, and must be eaten with ginger. Some say that Luosu contains sulfur and is suitable for the elderly. Those who like leeks and scallions must also like Luosu. It makes sense and can be believed. As for saying that eggplant is originally a poisonous grass that came from the Tartars, and that Wu Zhuzhu of Jin entered the Central Plains and planted it everywhere, hoping to poison people, and that the Song people cooked it with ginger and ate it, and they did not die, but obtained its seeds and spread them to each other, is an unfounded rumor.</p>
<h3>A Recent Interesting Drama in the Japanese Literary World</h3>
<p>— Ai Ai, sent from Japan</p>
<p>A sensational news story suddenly broke out in Japan a few days ago. From the end of the street to the alley, in the European café and tavern, everyone is talking about it. The sadness and beauty of the matter far exceeds the case of Huang Baiying and Yi Sanmao in Shanghai. As the sun sets in the west, the courtyard becomes cool. I will write it down with my clumsy pen, as an aid for the people of our country to talk about Ying.</p>
<p>There are three key players in this matter: the famous Japanese writer Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, his wife Chiyoko, and the famous novelist Haruo Satō. Jun'ichirō Tanizaki and Chiyoko have been married for seventeen years. Seventeen years ago, Chiyoko was a famous courtesan in Maebashi Konya-cho. With her slender waist and beautiful face, she was famous for a time. Countless people paid homage to her under her skirt. At that time, Jun'ichirō Tanizaki was already a writer of some fame. While writing, he often indulged in pleasure. When he met Chiyoko, it was as if he had suddenly seen five hundred years of amorous karma. The two fell deeply in love with each other. Before long, Mr. Tanizaki paid a considerable bride price and hid her in a golden house. Since then, they spent their days together, a pair of shadows. Sometimes they would sit close to each other in the cinema, or embrace each other in a foxtrot dance. Those who read Mr. Tanizaki's novels could always say that the beautiful woman depicted in his books was vividly on the page. This was a portrait of his beloved. It was not expected that the waves of love would be so rough, and good things would be short-lived. The couple, who had lived together for seventeen years, would once again separate. The uniqueness of their divorce is sure to open a new record in the separation and reunion in the world of love. Or perhaps it is a kind of courteous style.</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, Mr. Tanizaki, Chiyoko, and Haruo Satō suddenly jointly issued a delicate card to their relatives and friends, saying that Haruo Satō will formally marry Mr. Tanizaki's wife, Chiyoko. The three of them have completely agreed on this matter. They are afraid that their relatives and friends are not yet aware of this, so they are hereby informed. They also hope for understanding. At the end of the card, Mr. Tanizaki added that he would travel far away on his own. After this notification-style card was distributed to the community, everyone who heard it ran around in shock, considering it a strange story. News reporters gathered at Mr. Tanizaki's door to inquire about the truth. Mr. Tanizaki is very straightforward. He met with all the visitors one by one and spoke frankly. According to him, Mr. Satō's love for his wife (Mr. Tanizaki's own words) Chiyoko, actually dates back to more than ten years ago. At that time, Chiyoko was still a prostitute in a brothel. When Chiyoko came to him, Mr. Satō and him were old friends, so they often visited each other. But in the past, he was very ignorant, because he did not know that their frequent visits had other intentions. Over time, he began to realize it. He had been trapped in this thorny triangle for a long time. Until recently, he finally made a firm decision to sacrifice himself in order to fulfill the love between Mr. Satō and Chiyoko. Because he believed that he had always loved Chiyoko. But Mr. Satō's love for Chiyoko was also very deep. He was relieved to entrust his beloved to someone who could truly love and care for her and was also loved by her. From now on, he would be alone, without any worries. He will travel to various places, indulging in the mountains and rivers, in order to seek new materials for his literature. Even his fifteen-year-old beloved daughter Ayuko will be given to Mr. Satō as an adopted daughter and will still live with her mother. Mr. Satō will move here soon (Mr. Tanizaki's current house) to become the new owner of this house. Mr. Tanizaki is only forty-five years old. Perhaps due to excessive use of his brain, he looks like he is in his fifties. When talking, he frequently smokes his hand-held pipe. The lingering smoke seems to indicate that the smoker has endless hidden pain. The reporter also asked him to introduce him to Mrs. Chiyoko and his daughter. Although Chiyoko is already past her prime (it is said that she is thirty-five years old), she still retains her charm. Her cherry lips are slightly pocked, resembling the Chinese movie star Xuan Jinglin. His daughter, Ms. Tenko, is full of beauty, and welcomes people with a smile. She is still a good girl with a natural innocence.</p>
<h3>European Travelogue (70)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Visiting the Palace of Versailles (5)</p>
<p>How magnificent the gardens of the Palace of Versailles are cannot be fully described by my clumsy pen. If you have visited it, you may have the same feeling - and it is definitely not something you can visit in one or two days. We enjoyed our visit so much that we continued to play in Versailles for another day the following week. Usually, apart from tourists from various countries, or a very small number of students who occasionally do not go for walks in the forest or boat rides on the streams, very few Parisians go there. However, during the spring break, especially on that day of the week, Parisians came in droves. This time we decided to go boating on the Ganlu Stream. - Let me add a sentence first. Because the stream in front of the Palace of Versailles is as clear as the Ganlu, I gave it this name. - Walking into the Palace of Versailles, we went straight to the garden. Especially Hu'er, he was eager to try boating. He waved his arms, just shouting, "Hurry... hurry... hurry up!" He ran forward desperately, truly as happy as a swimming fish in the water. As we were about to reach the Apollo Basin, we saw the clear stream from afar. Hu'er's happy heart seemed to be burning like a flame. Unexpectedly, when we walked to the stream with excitement, we did not see any empty boats. We only saw dozens of exquisite, pointed boats busy going back and forth in the middle of the stream, which made us open our eyes in surprise. The two banks of the stream are lush green forests, stretching for more than ten miles. In the forest are car roads and horse roads, with extremely long routes, which can circle around the front and back of the palace. Some people also like to travel by car. Especially the white stone pedestrian road by the stream, lined with a green lawn and reflecting the clear blue stream, presents a beautiful, harmonious, and rhythmic style. It clearly shows the special qualities of the French people here. Ah, Hu'er - his heart was just watching the many teenagers sailing their boats there in a daze.</p>
<p>"Buzz - the coffee produced under the forest, the snow-white tables and chairs, are indeed elegant and lovely. Let's rest here for a moment." Mr. Chen Renhao said. It turned out that there was a very beautiful open-air coffee shop in the forest by the stream, which was prepared for tourists to rest and watch the scenery. We followed Mr. Chen's suggestion and sat down for coffee while waiting for an empty boat.</p>
<p>Before long, two teenagers sailed a boat closer to this side. Hu'er ran forward and asked loudly in French -</p>
<p>"Can we continue to row this boat? Is their time up?"</p>
<p>"Yes - yes. You can row it." The boat owner replied. After the two teenagers came ashore, we got on the boat in turn. Liu Kang operated the oars and worked hard to move forward. Soon we were floating in the middle of the vast stream. The stream is clear, without even a single reed. It can truly be said to be pure and natural. Both banks are verdant green trees, dripping with emerald green and reflecting green light in the water. What a charming realm this is. We sat in a boat and floated upstream. The warm spring breeze blew slowly. I felt a sense of intoxication.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Gold Market is Increasingly Sluggish</p>
<p>The 560 Tael Mark is Broken - Yesterday, the 28th, the price of gold fell sharply. However, there were no special changes. There was only a fluctuation of six or seven taels throughout the day. The market showed a mediocre trend. As for foreign exchange, it was slightly weak. Although banks were buying, they were not active. The psychology of the industry has turned soft. The 560 tael mark has now been broken. The buying interest of Yiyu and Shunli was more active in the early market. Yuansheng, Yuanmao, Yong, etc. were selling. The overseas silver market showed slight differences. Large bars continued to shrink by one-sixteenth. American silver rebounded by one-eighth. Therefore, the early market was weak. Afterwards, there were advances and retreats of three or four taels, fluctuating around 60 taels. Later, the Dalian gang bought a little in the late market. Yuanxing Yongqiu was hesitant, and the price had fallen below 60 taels.</p>
<p>The Opening Plunged Three Taels and Five - The opening price for October this morning was 561 taels and 4 qian, a decrease of 2 taels and 5 qian compared to the closing price the day before. This was probably due to the slight decrease in British silver and the increase in American silver, which stimulated it. Then there was a fluctuation of more than one tael. Then, because Yiyu, Shunli, and others chased after buying, they immediately drove up the price by 3 taels and 0, reaching 63 taels and 9 qian. The exchange rate was also stable. After the first order was posted and listed without change, and Yuancheng, Yuanxing, Yong, etc. successively invested, the people's hearts were downward. It has now fallen by 4 taels. At 10 o'clock, it was only 57 taels and 7 qian. Later, Macgregor bought November British gold at 7 pence and 3125. Yuanxing, Yongtai, Kangrun also bought back, and the trend turned upward, raising it by more than 4 taels. However, there was a review of one tael and several qian from time to time. Then Mitsui bought one tael, two qian, six fen, and seventy-five of October Japanese gold, and the bank counteracted November British gold at 7 pence and 25. At 11 o'clock, it rose to 62 taels and 4 qian, but the sellers were still very anxious, and it had already lost more than 3 taels. At 11:30, it was around 59 taels. Not long after, there were suddenly more buyers, and those who were floating short advanced. Just before closing, it jumped to 61 taels and 8 qian, immediately repairing more than one tael. The noon closing price was 60 taels and 02 qian. The announced price was 630 taels and 06 qian, a 70 tael difference.</p>
<p>In the End, Five Taels and Three Were Shaved Off - The afternoon opened at 59 taels and 8 qian. Later, because Yuanxing, Yong, and others bought in, it added more than one tael, totaling 61 taels and 4 qian. Afterwards, Yuanxing, Yong suddenly sold, and the people's hearts were frustrated, and the exchange market was also loose. September British gold was sold in Taiwan at 7 pence and 3125, but Shanghai bought October at 7 pence and 375, so the gold price fluctuated by one tael. By 3 o'clock, it was gradually downstream, falling by 4 taels, to 57 taels and 2 qian at 3:30. By the end, the buyers seemed to be active, but there were no large batches of orders in and out. If the people's hearts were slightly better, it would be raised by more than 2 taels, to 59 taels and 9 qian at 4:20. The closing price at 4:30 was 59 taels and 6 qian, a decrease of 5 taels and 3 qian compared to the day before. The maximum price for the day was 63 taels and 9 qian, and the minimum price was 57 taels and 2 qian, a fluctuation of 6 taels and 7 qian. The announced price difference was 71 taels. The booked water supplement was 71 taels for both the early and late markets. The item's early market was 61 taels and 6 qian, the noon closing was 59 taels and 5, the afternoon was 60 taels, and the closing price was 59 taels and 5.</p>
<p>There Were No Large Transactions - The buying and selling of each number was not large. Yuanxing Yu, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, and Yu Da all entered. Dadacheng, Taikangrun, Yuanxingyong, Zhifengyong, etc. had uncertain entries and exits. Yuanchengyong, Yuancheng, and Yuanmaoyong all exited. In the afternoon, Yuancheng and Yuanchengyong exited slightly. Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, and Zhifengyong exited and entered from time to time. Wanxing and Shunli bought more and sold less. The Dalian gang bought the top ten, a total of 3,500 to 3,600 bars, and sold 1,200 to 1,300 bars. The Guangdong gang's attitude was mediocre, only buying a small number, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange is Flat Both Openly and Secretly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC posted exchange rates for all currencies without any changes. However, the overseas silver markets were different. British silver shrunk while American silver grew. However, the market conditions were mediocre. The exchange rate between British and Japanese silver has been mediocre for a long time. The electricity increased slightly yesterday. As for the domestic market of the banks in this port, there was a slight fluctuation. The morning question seemed weak, but then it became strong. It relaxed again at noon, and it was flat in the afternoon. As a result, compared with the previous noon, British silver grew by 125, American silver grew by 1875, and Japanese silver decreased by one point. This was because the gold market continued to be weak. It has broken the 60 tael mark. Chinese merchants and speculators sold some. British silver traded more than 100,000 pounds, and sold 100,000 pounds, which was taken in by Macgregor Shanghai, etc. There were a small number of settlements, and Lihua and Bianda also traded tens of thousands of pounds with each other. American silver was depressed. Japanese silver was sold for 670,000 yuan by gold companies, of which Dalian tickets accounted for the majority. Banks such as Mitsui and Korea absorbed it.</p>
<p>British Exchange The domestic market had a fluctuation of 125. The morning market price for September was one shilling, seven pence and 1875, October 25, November 3125. The purchase price was increased by 0625. The noon closing price for September was seven pence and 25, October 3125, November 375. The afternoon closing price was the same as the noon price.</p>
<p>American Exchange The domestic market had a 25 fluctuation, and the transaction was quiet. The morning market price for September was 38 yuan and 9375, October 39 yuan and 0625, November 9 yuan and 1875. The purchase price was increased by 125. The noon closing price for September was 39 yuan and 0625, and the purchase price was 1875. The October price was 1875, November 3125, and the purchase price was 39 yuan and 4375. The afternoon closing price was flat.</p>
<p>East Exchange The domestic market had a difference of one and a half points throughout the day.

<p>According to the London telegraph yesterday, the large bars continued to shrink slightly, and the base price did not change. Small transactions, the market was calm. The near and far periods both shrank by 0625, both being sixteen pence and 1875 (equivalent to one shilling, seven pence and 125 British silver).

<h3>The Foreign Market Will Be Lively Again</h3>
<p>Market Overview Yesterday, the foreign sales appetite seemed slightly silent, but as the end of the month approached, the preparation of cash for the settlement of public bonds in this street was lively again. Therefore, the buying and selling trend in the market turned more dominant, and the market price actually occupied a better situation. However, this item is purely a domestic circulation and is not a formal export sale, so the lizi price could not be as lively, and it was still at the original position of nine lizi. In addition, the various receiving and unpacking situations are quite complicated because the settlement is more complicated as the end of the month is approaching.</p>
<p>Lizi Breaking Prices (Foreign Lizi) The early market lizi price was seven qian, two fen, nine lizi, one hao and a half, which was two hao and a half better than the noon market the day before. In the noon market, because the supply side was enthusiastic and the demand side turned lax, the result was a change of two hao and a half, still seven qian, two fen and nine lizi. The transactions in both markets were quite considerable. (Silver Demolition) Silver demolition remained generous as usual. The early and noon markets were still two fen. There was still no market for adding water and listing.</p>
<h3>Auxiliary Currency Market Conditions Jiangnan Small Ocean Had a Slight Transaction in the Early Market. The Market Price</h3>

The Guangdong Small Ocean market was slightly lively. The early market was six qian, two fen, two li, seven hao and a half, which was half a li better than the previous noon. The noon market was half a li better again, to six qian, two fen, three li and two hao and a half. 100,000 jiao was traded in the early market, and 65,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were 390,000 qianwen, which was 1,000 qianwen weaker than the day before.</p>

<h3>Japan's Cash Reserve Ratio Reduced</h3>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from the 28th reports that the cash reserve recorded by the Bank of Japan in its settlement yesterday was further reduced to 866,682,500 yen, marking the lowest record in eleven years. Additionally, private deposits in the Bank of Japan have sharply decreased since mid-month to a small amount of around 150 million yen.</p>
<h3>Securities, Government Bonds for October Have Been Launched</h3>
<p>Today, the stock exchange is closed for settlement.</p>
<p>Today, the stock exchange is handling the settlement of August futures, and market trading is suspended. Yesterday, October futures trading began, but the market remained quite sluggish. October contracts for post-war rehabilitation, demobilization, and troop reduction have all started trading, but there is no market for other contracts. As for the trend of various bond prices, due to scarce transactions and balanced supply and demand, they remained stagnant, fluctuating only by a few cents throughout the day, but ultimately rose slightly compared to the previous day. Total spot transactions for the day were 18,000 yuan, and futures transactions reached approximately 4 million yuan in the morning and over 2.3 million yuan in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Yarn Market Shows Signs of Fatigue</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, mainly due to sluggish sales of spot yarn, increased yarn inventories, softening raw cotton prices, and generally lackluster external conditions. Consequently, new sellers are concentrated. The Chaozhou traders have dumped 20,000 bales in recent days, increasing the pressure from this group. However, some buyers are also actively acquiring. The yarn market has been suppressed for a long time, and a significant change is anticipated. The October inventory is reported to be a massive 40,000+ bales, while prices remain relatively stable.</p>
<p>The RMB standard declines by about one or two liang. The opening price of the RMB standard in the previous market saw some selling by long positions from customer groups after the previous day. With stable foreign cotton prices, market sentiment was calm, but buyers were scarce. Prices for the 7th, 8th, and 9th months fell by seven, eight, or nine qian to one or two liang. The afternoon opening market remained soft, falling by two or three qian. Later, some short covering occurred. Yikang bought 850 bales, Rongxing 750 bales, and Yiyu, Yudda, Daji, Tianlong, Changji, Yichang, Shenli, Yongfeng, and Yiyu bought 300 to 500 bales. Taichang bought 1,300 bales, Shenchang 800 bales, and Jifeng, Dafeng, Dachang, Chengli, Changli, Shenmao, Jixiesheng bought 300 to 450 bales. The RMB standard closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>RMB Standard Closing Prices, Change, Inventory</p>
<p>November, 1546, Down 2, 57,750</p>
<p>September, 1557, Change, 25,800</p>
<p>December, 1545, 7, 26,550</p>
<p>October, 1549, Down 8, 40,850</p>
<p>January, 1543, 8, 18,600</p>
<p>Spot Market Increasingly Quiet, Spot yarn sales are quite clear. It is found that a total of 526 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day. Prices fell by 2.5 to 5 qian. Among the customer groups, Guang group bought 60 bales, Nanyang 35 bales, Yunnan 36 bales, inland 85 bales, Sichuan 210 bales, and miscellaneous groups 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Shows Flatness Again</h3>
<p>U.S. Cotton Slightly Down... Japanese Merchants Unchanged... New Cotton Business Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, but U.S. cotton is slightly down. Given the expected stable trend, the local market has not seen a major downturn. However, there is a lack of new buyers, and manufacturers are showing unusual calm. Factories are well-stocked with old cotton. In previous years, Japanese factories would purchase large quantities before the new cotton season to stock up, but this year their activity is noticeably less. This is because Indian cotton is abundant and sufficient for the rest of the year. Therefore, the new cotton business has not been bustling. The annual yields from various regions are quite good, so merchants from Hubei sell whenever prices rise.</p>
<h3>Hubei Standard Recovers and Falls by One or Three Qian. The Hubei Standard opened in the previous market, expecting U.S. cotton to continue rising, but it remained flat, and sentiment eased. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices fell by two qian. In the afternoon, prices fluctuated by five fen. Total transactions for the day were 25,400 dan. Yiyu sold 1,500 dan, Yiyu 1,400 dan, Yongfeng 1,500 dan, Tongxing 1,000 dan, Xincheng 1,900 dan, Shenchang 1,000 dan, Dafeng, Zhenda, Maoji, Yongchang, Deji, and Xiesheng 900 to 1,000 dan. Tianchang bought 2,200 dan, Dachangcheng 1,400 dan, Taixing 1,500 dan, Yicheng 1,100 dan, Yikang, Minghua, Tianlong, Senkang, Changfeng, and Jifeng 900 to 700 dan. The Hubei Standard closing prices are listed below:</h3>
<p>Hubei Standard Closing Prices, Change, Inventory</p>
<p>December, 33.05, Down 11, 191,800</p>
<p>October, 32.80, Down 15, 89,400</p>
<p>January, 35.15, 15, 97,000</p>
<p>November, 33.00, 20, 7,000</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Business Comes to a Halt Again Spot transactions have turned quiet, and factories have very limited appetite. Only customers from Guangdong are buying some low-grade cotton.</p>
<p>Low-Grade Cotton, 35.80, Bought by Guangdong customers, 800 bales</p>
<p>Spot Warehouse Delivery of New Low-Grade Cotton, 34.4 to 34.0, Bought by Guangdong customers, 578 bales, Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<h3>Stable Situation in Overseas Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>U.S. and Japanese Cotton Sales Turn Soft Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially firm due to speculative buying, but then selling occurred due to good weather. Finally, it firmed again due to some short covering. Futures prices fluctuated by one to three points, while spot prices fell by five points. British cotton futures rose by five points, while spot prices rose by two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by five points. Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 27th):</p>

<h3>Food, Rice Market Stabilizes After Decline</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than ten sources arrived from various routes. Due to the continuous decline, buyers from various parties became more determined to enter the market, and the overall trend stabilized. Top-grade broken japonica rice from the northern regions recovered by one jiao and a half. Ordinary and lower-grade japonica rice all showed stability. Dongxin japonica rice remained around 17 yuan. Thin early rice was scarce and mediocre. Special grade new customer glutinous rice opened high at 13.5 yuan. Baiyuan turned upward by two or three jiao. High-grade rice reached about 18.8 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: About ten boats arrived from the river. Sales in the local market were slow. Top-grade broken japonica rice was scarce and popular, opening at 20 yuan, 0.67 jiao. The trend for ordinary Tongli japonica rice remained sluggish, as retail sales had not yet expanded. Thin early rice from the southern regions was scarce and sales were flat. The market was quiet. Arrivals and sales of Dongxin japonica rice were balanced, and the decline stabilized, with prices opening at 17 yuan. The sale of Tongbian was active, and prices rose, with top-grade rice reaching 18.78 yuan.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Nearly 10,000 Bags of Hunan Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Sales of foreign rice are extremely quiet.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was quite sluggish yesterday due to the arrival of Hunan rice at the port, with most customers taking a wait-and-see approach. The total market saw only North Shanghai merchants and individual customers buy 1,000 bags of Saigon rice, priced at 15.8 yuan to 15.35 yuan; 700 bags of Big Twisted Rice were sold, priced at 12.1 yuan. High-grade rice was scarce and did not open, with prices similar to the previous day. The issue of Hunan rice exports has been reported earlier. The official lifting of the ban is set for September 1, with a passport fee of 2 yuan. Those who load before September 1 must pay an additional handling fee of 1 yuan, plus miscellaneous taxes of several jiao. Approximately 30,000 bags were loaded out of Hunan around August 22, of which about 9,000 bags were shipped directly after passing through Hankou. This rice arrived in Shanghai successively on the evening of the day before yesterday and yesterday. The remaining 20,000+ bags were detained by the Hankou authorities, who demanded an additional donation tax of 1 yuan before they could pass. Merchants only agreed to donate one jiao, making it difficult to reach an agreement, and preventing the simultaneous arrival of the 9,000 bags. Subsequent batches may face difficulties in enthusiastically sourcing rice due to the heavy donation tax, making transportation unprofitable. However, it is heard that Hunan Province has already approved more than 600,000 passports. The arrived Hunan rice is Jìnggǎng and Jishī rice, costing 13-14 yuan. Yesterday's solicitation resulted in bids of only 13.1-13.2 yuan for Jinggang rice and 12.5-12.1 yuan for Jishi rice. The owners, considering it unprofitable, were unwilling to sell immediately, so no bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Distant Flour Prices Greatly Weaken</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday, market prices for all months fell, with the distant market being even weaker. Although the Social Affairs Bureau intervened and set price limits for this month, the market trend remained strong. This is because sales in North China have started, and the lifting of the ban in Tianjin seems to be implemented on September 1. These merchants have been buying period flour for this month on the market and have been in contact with a certain factory. However, the factory does not have much spot flour, so the market is very good. The Social Affairs Bureau's intervention, short covering, and flour returned to the warehouse by cargo customers have all failed to suppress its market price. After the lifting of the ban in North China is implemented, the market should rise. However, the number of foreign flour orders in Tianjin is extremely large. In the past week alone, there have been transactions for more than one million bags, and combined with previously finalized orders, there are no fewer than several million bags, all due to arrive in September, October, November, December, and January. In this case, the distant Shanghai flour market will not improve due to the lifting of the ban but will instead be shorted by customer groups. Cloth prices are moving down slightly. At closing, this month was only slightly higher by 0.25, September and October slightly lower by 0.015, and November, December, and January slightly lower by 0.02 each.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Shows an Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Most of the current month's futures have been settled.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened yesterday, this month's contracts have mostly expired. Only the September contracts showed a good near-term trend, with prices rising by 0.01 to 0.02 immediately upon opening. October contracts followed suit, rising by 0.01. Distant contracts were neither affected by the good near-term trend nor received attention from buyers and sellers, resulting in a lackluster market. Later, some Yangtze River customers sold off a small amount, causing the market to pull back slightly by 0.01. There were no changes until closing. This month's contracts are currently being settled, with over 100 truckloads of goods being delivered for inspection. Half of them passed inspection, so only about 80 truckloads remain unsettled by short sellers. However, due to unresolved issues such as price increases and settlement prices, settlement has not yet been completed. This batch of wheat is mostly being acquired by traders and transferred to factories. About half of it has already been settled, and the total number will be completed in one or two days. Spot goods opened at 4,000 bags, and the market remained stable. The goods were from Yaowan, Xuzhou, Shaoxing, Haizhou, Hankou, Daorenqiao, etc., and were acquired by Fufeng and Fuxin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Spot Japanese Sugar Opens Strong, Turns Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market news from producing areas: The price of spot Cuban sugar was 1.1875, up 0.0625 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.13, up 0.02 from the previous dispatch, December was 1.25, up 0.01, March next year was 1.38, and May was 1.46, each up 0.02. The price of spot Javanese sugar was 8.875, futures for September was 8.6875, and October was 8.5625, with only September slightly up 0.0625 from the previous day. At the Public Association Market, the demand for Dutch 24 grade coarse white sugar was particularly quiet, with sellers quoting 7 liang 9 qian 5 fen. Slightly lower quality was priced at 7 liang 8 qian 5 fen, with very few inquiries. The market sentiment has turned flat and weak. Finely ground white sugar was priced at 8 liang 05 fen, still relatively firm. Japanese sugar N mark was 7 liang 9 qian 5 fen, J mark was 8 liang 1 qian 5 fen, YP mark was 7 liang 9 qian 7 fen 5 fen, with slight transactions, and the market was even more critical. YT mark was 7 liang 8 qian 5 fen, with relatively less demand. This is because the Japanese sugar factory has been selling Minghua first white sugar from 20,000 bags, priced at 6 yuan each day. The firms' buying intention is still strong, so they continued to open 10,000 bags, and Meiji Sugar also opened 10,000 bags, all for delivery in October. The market sentiment is flat and weak, so the spot sugar allocation market has been significantly impacted.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods, New Longan Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The new longan from Zhangzhou and Tong'an that arrived on the Jinan wheel the day before yesterday was opened by various firms yesterday. This batch has a relatively large quantity, and old stocks are running out, so the market situation is quite tight. Top-grade, large-sized longan opened at around 45 liang, medium-grade at around 30 liang, and lower-grade at 17-18 liang. Zhangzhou goods started from around 27 liang, down to 9 liang, with varying prices. The market outlook is bound to ease.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Overseas Silk Sales Remain Nonexistent</h3>
<p>Although the opening prices for Chinese and Japanese raw silk in overseas markets are cheap, there are transactions but no market. Factory sales are stagnant. The price of B-grade factory silk has fallen below 1,000 liang, but no telegrams have been received. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported ten bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Kaili, etc., imported fifteen bales of yellow factory silk, and prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>Italian Autumn Cocoons Achieve a 50% Harvest</h3>
<p>Affected by the weather</p>
<p>This year's autumn cocoons in Italy have suffered from earthquakes and hurricane disasters. The first batch of silkworm eggs was completely lost. Farmers supplemented with late-season silkworms, but they were damaged by wind and rain after the second molt. They have now reached the mounting stage. It is estimated that this year's national autumn cocoons will only yield about 50% compared to a normal year.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea Continues to See Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wuyuan Gaozhuang Zhenmei tea from Yingzhuang, Jinlong, Baochang, Tianxiang, and other firms saw purchases. The total city has already transacted over 400 boxes, and the market remains stable. Needle-like and fine-leaf teas are trading quite actively, but sales prices are generally lower. However, since the Russian firm stopped buying Qining black tea, British firms have shown no interest, and the market is quite desolate.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, Asphalt Autumn Sales Set to Begin</h3>
<p>Due to the poor conditions last winter, asphalt shipments decreased. This spring, goods from the Jingyi area of Hubei to Hankou were still in demand, so the market did not seem tight. However, after entering summer, the source gradually decreased, and soap factories needed more, the situation gradually became insufficient to meet sales. The market suddenly rose sharply. Macheng oil in Hankou was the most scarce, soaring to 18 liang. Jinzhou, Zhijiang, and Jinshi oils also rose sharply. High-quality Jingyi was also increased to 18 liang, Pingjing 17 liang 4-5 qian, Zhizhong 17 liang 2-3 qian, Jinshi 17 liang, the highest price since the European war. Local Shanghai oil firms initially sold a fixed amount. Fortunately, they had replenished their stocks before the price increase, so their losses were limited. However, since the market price surged, they have not dared to stock up much, as they are wary of high prices. However, inventories in various places are not large. According to detailed letters from Hankou, the total amount of oil is only 4,500 dan. It is feared that the autumn use will not be easily met, so the situation is expected to be strained. Although Macheng and Hankou have now eased slightly, they still require 17 liang. Autumn sales are about to begin, and Shanghai's inventory is extremely low. Traders are still watching. However, considering the situation in various places, it will be difficult to expect cheaper prices before the new goods are released. However, because prices are high, sales are bound to decrease, which is why traders are not stocking up heavily. There has been some activity in Shanghai recently, but it is not yet booming. It is heard that autumn harvesting will gradually begin, and the market will not be as desolate as before. This is recorded to observe the future.</p>
<h3>Metals, Over One Thousand Dan of Scrap Iron Are Sold</h3>
<p>East White Iron Inventory Large, Price Small... Over Ten Thousand Sheets May Arrive Today</p>
<p>Since the exchange rate for scrap iron was lengthened, the standard has weakened, so market trading is still lively. Yesterday, it was heard that firms from Tianjin and Hankou received letters from the local areas asking for more, so there were many market transactions. It was found that over 1,300 dan of spot goods have been sold, but the price is unknown as both parties are keeping it secret. The abundant inventory of East White Iron has been noted in this newspaper, and the price has been greatly affected since the Wen Chang Bank auctioned off a large amount of spot goods. Three-foot seven-inch was sold at 1 liang 1 qian 2 fen, and three-foot six-inch was sold at 9 qian 2 fen. It is heard that over 10,000 sheets of spot goods may arrive today. There is no worry about a shortage in the market outlook.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Afternoon's Thunderstorm</h3>
<p>Water Accumulated on Roads, Forming Ditches</p>
<p>Damaged Power Lines, Streetcars Stopped</p>
<p>Old House Collapsed Suddenly in the Rain</p>
<p>Strange Tales in Zhabei Amidst the Thunderstorm</p>
<p>Since entering autumn, the weather has been abnormally hot. The temperature has been particularly high in recent days. Yesterday morning, it was cloudy and sultry. By about 3:15 PM, the sky was covered with dark clouds, as dark as night. In an instant, thunder and lightning flashed, and the sound of explosions was deafening. Heavy rain also poured down. At around 4:09 PM, another flash of lightning struck, followed by a loud bang. Eyes went dark, and houses shook. Lights went out everywhere. Such thunderclaps were truly rare in recent years. The sights and sounds of the thunderstorm are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Water Accumulated in Low-Lying Areas, Forming Ditches</h3>
<p>During the downpour, the roadside sewers were unable to drain the water, and it accumulated, forming ditches. In the Chinese areas, such as Xiaonanmen (Small South Gate), Xiaoximen (Small West Gate), Dadongmen (Great East Gate), and Dongma Bridge in the city, the water on the roads was more than a foot deep, making it difficult for vehicles to travel. In the houses of various residents, the water was knee-deep, and basins, buckets, and odds and ends floated on the surface of the water, a shocking sight. In the International Settlement, North Zhejiang Road, Second Avenue, Fourth Avenue, Da Xin Street, and the Racecourse area also became a vast expanse of water. Cars drove through, splashing water more than ten feet high, a spectacular sight. In the French Concession, on Avenue Joffre, Xixinqiao Street, Zilaihuo Street, Dongxinqiao Street, and other places, the roads were like swamps. Rickshaw pullers were busy carrying passengers, making three times their usual profit.</p>
<h3>Tram Service Temporarily Suspended Due to Thunderstorms</h3>
<p>During the thunderstorm, both tram companies in the concessions, as a precautionary measure, temporarily cut off the electricity. This caused all trams on the roads to come to a standstill. After about ten minutes, service was restored, and the trams resumed operation. However, due to the scarcity of pedestrians, the trams were quite empty.</p>
<h3>Damage to French Concession Power Lines</h3>
<p>The streetlights on Avenue Edward VII, Rue de Consul, Route Cardinal Mercier, and Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession were completely extinguished. It was not until 8:40 PM that the lines were repaired. The lights in the Dongxinqiao vegetable market area were also completely out. Factory technicians were dispatched to repair the damage, which took five hours. The lights were not restored until 9:21 PM. Additionally, all the lights at the Great World amusement park went out with a loud crash of thunder. The stages were flooded, and the water at the entrance was about five inches deep. Visitors had to use rickshaws to cross the water, and each crossing cost as much as 200 cash.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Delayed</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:30 PM, both northbound and southbound trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway were traveling when the weather turned dark, with thick clouds and thunderstorms. It soon began to rain heavily with strong winds. As a result, both passenger and freight trains on the line slowed down to ensure safety. The wind and rain were even stronger between Jiaxing and Hangzhou. Fortunately, the telegraph and telephone lines along the route were undamaged. However, passenger trains numbered 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, which were traveling in the afternoon, did not arrive at their destinations on time.</p>
<h3>Old Building Collapses on Zhaojia Road</h3>
<p>In Guozixiang, next to the Caishen Temple on Zhaojia Road within the city, eight or nine old buildings, which had been neglected for years and were in a state of disrepair, were being demolished by workers hired by the owner. Half of the buildings had already been taken down. Several buildings, numbered 262 to 266 on the west side, remained. Yesterday afternoon, during a fierce storm, the foundations weakened, and with a loud crash, they all collapsed. Fortunately, the heavy rain kept the workers away and there were no pedestrians on the road, so no one was injured. The local police station investigated the contractor and imposed a fine.</p>
<h3>Strange Tale from Zhabei During the Thunderstorm</h3>
<p>During the heavy thunderstorm in Zhabei, some electrical awnings on the streets were damaged, such as those on Shunzheng Road, Guangfu Road, and Jiangwan Road. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company immediately dispatched workers to repair them. However, one incident was quite peculiar. It is said that at the Shunhe Teahouse, owned by Gong Liangfu from Shandong, at the intersection of Che Dai Jiao, Tongji Road, and Hanzhong Road, around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, during the heavy thunderstorm, Gong's son, Gong Dinghai, was reading a newspaper. Suddenly, there was a loud crash of thunder that went straight through the windows. Immediately, the door panels, stove, and floor were covered with a liquid resembling blood. The newspaper in Gong's hand was also splattered with red bloodstains. This caused a commotion, and everyone marveled at the strange event.</p>
<h3>Jiang Dingwen Sends Representatives to</h3>
<p>Comfort Wounded Soldiers of the 9th Division</p>
<p>Special Envoy Arrives in Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>Since joining the campaign against the rebels, the 9th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, under the command of Jiang Dingwen, has fought bravely across Shandong and Henan, achieving remarkable victories but also suffering many casualties. Division Commander Jiang Dingwen deeply sympathized with the wounded soldiers recovering in the rear. He specifically sent his secretary and the head of the wartime propaganda team, Cai Mengsheng, along with the deputy head, Sun Jinwen, carrying letters and supplies to comfort them in the rear. It is reported that Cai and Sun have already passed through Shanghai from Hangzhou and will visit each rear hospital along the Shanghai-Nanjing line to offer their condolences. The special envoys told a reporter from the Guomin News Agency that the division had fought in over twenty battles, large and small, and had never retreated. Casualties numbered around three thousand, making it an even more arduous campaign than the one against Tang Shengzhi in Queshan last year. However, morale was extremely high. Recently, they inflicted heavy casualties on the remaining enemy forces along the Longhai Railway line. Lankao and Qi County were within easy reach. The enemy had no other option but to retreat to Zhengzhou and defend Tongguan. The military situation should be resolved within a month. After speaking, they left. The letter from Division Commander Jiang Dingwen to the wounded soldiers of the division in the rear hospitals is as follows:</p>
<p>My Dearest and Most Hardworking Revolutionary Comrades,</p>
<p>Our division has been ordered to fight against the rebels for three months now. During these three months, we have braved the intense heat, traveled across Henan and Shandong, and fought bitterly with the enemy. They have suffered repeated defeats, and every time they hear of our division's arrival, they lose color and flee in terror. This is all thanks to the brave soldiers who have fought valiantly and worked hard for the revolution. Now, the rebels Feng and Yan are trying to make a last-ditch effort. Unfortunately, many of our brave comrades have been wounded in the repeated fierce battles. It is a great honor for the soldiers to sacrifice themselves for the completion of true unification and for the realization of the Three Principles of the People. We will never consider it a hardship. Revolutionary soldiers are not afraid of death, let alone injury. Moreover, being wounded for the country, the body may suffer pain, but the spirit will surely feel joy. As your division commander, I feel like your brother and father. Your injuries are like my own, and I am deeply moved. I sincerely hope that you will recuperate and recover quickly. While in the hospital, you must maintain order and not cause trouble. If you disregard your reputation and dare to violate the law, even if you have contributed to the revolution, you will not escape the punishment of the law. Our division has participated in many wars and has spared no sacrifice. It is all to uphold the teachings of our late Premier, to overthrow the warlords internally and resist imperialism externally, in order to achieve national unity and international equality. Now that the revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must continue to work hard. Our responsibility will not end until Yan and Feng are eliminated. Most of the officers and soldiers of this division have participated in every campaign and every battle since the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic. We have shared hardships and difficulties and have a long history with this division. We should not become lazy due to injuries, be afraid of difficulties, or become scattered and lose our position. As your division commander, I will always follow the spirit of love and sincerity of our late Premier, and I will do my best to command and care for all officers and soldiers, whether they are wounded or not. Due to the empty national treasury, the government has not been able to issue salaries on time, which has affected the lives of our comrades. I, as your division commander, have also tried to find ways to solve this problem, but I am powerless to do so. My heart is filled with sympathy and concern. I have specifically sent representatives with supplies to various rear hospitals to express my heartfelt condolences. I, as your division commander, am fighting on the same front as our comrades. I have not dared to slack off for a moment. Now, the number of enemy forces on the Longhai and Jinpu lines has been repeatedly attacked by our army, resulting in casualties a hundred times greater than ours. They have lost their fighting ability, and their complete elimination is only a matter of time. Comrades, based on our consistent determination to eliminate evil, you should heal your wounds, return to your original units, and work together to make a final effort to eliminate the remaining rebels and complete the National Revolution. Division Commander Jiang Dingwen</p>

<h3>British Far East Observation Group</h3>
<p>Departs for China on September 19th</p>
<p>As previously reported, the British economic group organized by British business circles is about to come to China. According to news from British business circles yesterday, the group, including the cotton and pharmaceutical groups, a total of twelve people, have chosen to set sail directly from London to China by boat on the 19th of next month. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 4th or 5th of October. The important tasks of this group are: the economic group will be responsible for carefully investigating the state of the country's commercial market in China and what methods should be adopted to cater to the Chinese psychology in order to develop Far East trade; the cotton industry group will specifically investigate the current situation of the Chinese cotton industry in order to prepare for expanding business in China after returning home. Shanghai is the center of Chinese commerce, so the group will first arrive here to investigate, and then go to places such as Hankou and Guangzhou. It is expected to stay in China for about two months, so the return to England is expected to be at the end of this year. The names of the group members are as follows: (1) Economic Group: Chairman Sir Thomas (also Chairman of the Cotton Industry Group), members Sir Allen, Morrow, Bell, Crosse, Peel, and six others. (2) Cotton Industry Group Members: Befanlev, Dukesburg, Imanzeng, Green, Rice, and Weiers etc.</p>
<h3>August 29th Commemoration</h3>
<p>Postponed</p>
<p>Declaration Issued</p>
<p>Today, August 29th, is the National Humiliation Memorial Day for the Treaty of Nanjing in the Opium War. The Shanghai Special City Party Department Propaganda Department and the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association have jointly prepared for this event. The original date for the memorial service was scheduled for this morning at the City Party Department Auditorium, but it has been postponed due to a scheduling conflict with the Citizens' Assembly. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, in addition to drafting commemorative measures to be followed by anti-drug organizations nationwide, issued the following declaration today:</p>
<p>August 29th is the date when China succumbed to the opium war and signed the Treaty of Nanjing under duress, due to diplomatic failure and oppression by the power and violence of British imperialists. Counting the years, today is the 88th anniversary. Looking back, we cannot help but express our heartfelt pain and offer a sincere warning to our compatriots. Originally, during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, people from all walks of life in our country, realizing the scourge of opium, which led to the ruin of families and death, rose up in opposition. The Qing court immediately issued a strict ban. At that time, all the opium was shipped by the British from India, first to Guangzhou, and then distributed to various places. The Qing court then appointed Lin Zexu, the most courageous, as the governor-general of Liangguang. He immediately confiscated all 20,283 chests of opium from British merchants and burned them all at Humen in Guangzhou. The British were not willing to give in, so they sent warships to attack the coastal areas of our country. Lin Zexu defended effectively, but the Qing court was frightened and quickly dismissed Lin and negotiated peace with the British, signing the Treaty of Nanjing, which humiliated the country and damaged its sovereignty. The treaty contained thirteen articles, with various unreasonable oppressions needless to say, but the most important three points were as follows: (1) Open five ports—Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Ningbo, and Shanghai—to British trade and establish consulates. (2) Cede Hong Kong Island to Britain. (3) Pay compensation for opium losses and military expenses, totaling 21 million yuan. From then on, the Chinese nation as a whole fell into a state of irreversible decline. All imperialists, from then on, knew that China could be bullied, and they all sought opportunities to exploit China, one after another signing a large number of unequal treaties. Therefore, this Nanjing Treaty was the first time our country's diplomacy failed. It was also our country's first national humiliation, and China's first bill of sale. Because before the Opium War, foreigners did not fully understand the truth of our country's internal affairs and still had fear and dared not openly insult us. After the Opium War and the establishment of the Nanjing Treaty, the corruption within the country was fully exposed, and foreigners had no scruples, competing to carve us up, leaving our country with no chance to recover. When we think of this Treaty of Nanjing, how can we not feel pain and sorrow? Today, foreign powers are exploiting China from a political invasion to an economic extraction. And the various unequal treaties resulting from this Treaty of Nanjing are still being preserved. Look at the foreign opium being shipped to China, and even the large amount of narcotics entering China, which time was it not under the protection of concessions and consular jurisdiction, continuing to poison China and greedily plunder the wealth of our people? We are in such an unfortunate situation, apart from uniting with one heart to abolish unequal treaties, we must not forget our anti-drug responsibilities, because although the treaty was created by Britain, it was also due to the ignorance of our people, which led to the great trap of the British, and the British would never have started the war for no reason. Now, the harm of opium and narcotics poisoning China far outweighs that of 88 years ago. We should fundamentally awaken the people of the province and unite to reject drugs, so as not to fail the significance of today's commemoration.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Qingdao Telegraph Line Connected Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to news from the China Telegraph Office, since the National Army recovered Jinan, the Jinpu telegraph lines have been repaired one after another. The telegraph line from the Ministry of Transportation Telegraph General Office on Sichuan Road in this city directly to Qingdao was also connected yesterday (the 28th) morning. All telegraphs sent to Qingdao can be delivered in more than ten minutes, which is much faster than in the past when it had to be routed through Yantai. It has been verified that only the China Telegraph Office in this city has direct communication with Qingdao, just as the China Telegraph Office is the fastest and most accurate for sending telegraphs to Dalian.</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Night Mail Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Starting September 1st</p>
<p>The Wireless Radio Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, in the past, because the night service of each radio station was not very busy, specially used the free time to receive and send domestic night mail telegrams in order to facilitate public communication. Now, because business is increasing day by day, and the exchanges of various newspapers at each radio station are extremely crowded, it is difficult to take care of receiving and sending night telegrams. An order has been received from the Ministry to temporarily suspend operations starting from September 1st in order to avoid accumulation.</p>
<h3>Negotiation of Jinliyuan Wharf Yesterday</h3>
<p>Please Proceed with Treaty Revision and Lease Renewal</p>
<p>French Consul Promises to Help</p>
<p>Regarding the Jinliyuan Wharf lease negotiation case between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Santedang, the diplomatic method was previously used to transfer legal procedures to arbitration. However, the opinion of Santedang's arbitrator still pertains to the enforcement of the French Concession Court's judgment. Therefore, Gao Shuo, the arbitrator of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, visited the French Consul General, Gan Gelin, at 4:30 PM yesterday, requesting him to help completely abandon the judgment of the French Concession Court and change to arbitration for treaty revision and lease renewal. The French Consul promised to earnestly persuade Santedang. However, because Gan Gelin had to attend the board meeting of the French Municipal Council at 5:15 PM, he was unable to talk in detail. They agreed to meet again this (29th) afternoon at 4 PM, at which time they will have a more progressive consultation on the scope of arbitration and the date of commencement.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Appoints Special Commissioner for Military Transport Liaison</p>
<p>Cai Pei Returns to Shanghai from Beijing Tonight</p>
<p>Cai Pei, acting director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, considered military transport to be of utmost importance during this time of military conflict. Previously, military transport was handled concurrently by the business department. Since Cai's assumption of office, he specifically appointed Shi Weijun as the company's special commissioner for liaison with Ningbo's military transport matters, to avoid any errors that could delay military opportunities. Mr. Shi has been at the company for many days. Also, the newly appointed secretary, Jian Dingkui, reported to the company yesterday.

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously requested that pens and ink be exempted from taxes on behalf of the Pen and Ink Industry Association. After submitting the request to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Finance's reply has now been received. "We have received the report, and upon investigation, pens and ink are not purely educational supplies and cannot be compared with books. There are many other items related to education, such as paper, printing machines, ink, etc., and taxes are currently being collected. As for the original tax exemption case for native cloth, it only refers to the inland taxes and levies to be collected, and the export tax collected by the customs is not included in the tax exemption. The request for tax exemption for pens and ink is difficult to approve. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Dealers Strictly Abide by Price Limits</h3>
<p>Rice Purchase Certificates Must Still Be Strictly Implemented</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau previously stated that although rice shops have resumed independent trading, the rice price limit has not been lifted. In order to maintain the people's livelihood, it issued eight points to the rice industry to pay attention to and not violate. Later, the Bean and Rice Industry Association requested to withdraw the order, but the Social Affairs Bureau rejected it because the reasons given were insufficient. It is now reported that the Bean and Rice Industry Association has submitted another request to the Social Affairs Bureau, guaranteeing that its members will consistently abide by the rice price limit. If there is any deliberate violation and it is found to be true, they will accept severe punishment. As for the eight points that should be paid attention to, they requested permission to withdraw the order. The Social Affairs Bureau replied that since the association is responsible for ensuring that its members consistently abide by the price limit, the previous points were for the purpose of eliminating the industry's accumulated malpractices. If they can rectify themselves and pay close attention, the government will not need to interfere. As for the rice purchase certificates, they are only for assessing the rice shop's sales and should not cause much inconvenience to the industry. Starting from September 1st, they should be strictly implemented. In addition to ordering the Rice Shop Organization and Sorting Committee to submit the rice purchase certificates to this bureau for monthly calculation, please be informed.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants</h3>
<p>Cigarette Industry Representatives to Tianjin Today</p>
<p>Investigate Truth About Chinese and Foreign Inventory</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Cigarette Tax Administration stopped the transportation and sale of Chinese and foreign cigarettes to Hebei Province and ordered the British-American Tianjin factory to temporarily close down in order to maintain the unified tax system and eliminate illegal demands. The Chinese cigarette factories in this city have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Tianjin branch stating that the British-American Tobacco Company has more than 20,000 boxes of cigarettes in stock, which are being sold by the manager after paying taxes. They are openly resisting taxes and secretly engaging in monopoly, arousing public anger. The conference elected representatives to go to the Tax Administration to request remedial measures, which has been reported previously. The association's representatives went to the Tax Administration on the 25th, and Chief Cheng and Chief Wang, as well as Secretary Dong, received them. The representatives detailed the British-American Tobacco Company's situation, plans, and the details of Tianjin. They requested instructions on how to remedy the situation for Chinese merchants and denounced the attitude of the British-American Chinese staff member, Shen, who disregarded and harmed his colleagues to gain favor. Chief Cheng, after hearing the report, believed that the actions of the British-American were not false and expressed his apologies. He promised to inquire with the company's representatives the next day for further verification. When the company's representative, Shen Kun, arrived, he made various denials and claimed that after the tax construction was completed and the Tianjin factory started work, he would wait for the first batch of Chinese cigarettes to arrive in Tianjin before paying taxes and releasing them at the same time to maintain the same pace and avoid differences. He also promised to send a letter to the Chinese Cigarette Association after reporting back to the company for solicitation of opinions. Chief Cheng believed that the reports from the association's representatives were based only on telegrams and were difficult to verify. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that the association and the British-American company would send representatives to Tianjin to verify and report the facts for processing. It is now reported that the association has appointed Weng Guangtian as its representative, who will start his journey north today. The truth of the matter will soon come to light. However, the letter of solicitation that the British-American representative promised to send to the association has not yet arrived.</p>

<h3>Prohibition of Foreigners Photographing in the Interior</h3>
<p>The Garrison Headquarters Has Instructed Subordinates to Comply</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, yesterday received an instruction from the Ministry of Military Affairs stating, regarding the matter of ordering compliance, "The Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 2863 stated: 'In accordance with the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee's letter, requesting a directive to prohibit foreigners from taking photographs or filming in the interior of our country,' the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Education were instructed to draft measures and submit them for review, which were deemed feasible. It is hereby ordered that the said ministries comply accordingly.' Therefore, in addition to submitting a reply and separately issuing letters of instruction, we hereby copy the original proposal, instructing the said Commander to order subordinates to comply and implement it." The said headquarters has separately instructed its subordinates to comply. The following are excerpts from the original proposal, which has been reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan, regarding both immediate and fundamental solutions: (A) Immediate Solution: All kinds of base and vulgar customs in the interior of our country, such as slums, "swallows' nests," women with bound feet, beggar’s huts, monks performing rituals, village deity gatherings, and items related to public morals that insult the national character, should be prohibited by the Ministry of Interior from being photographed or filmed. Also, important national defense locations such as seaports and fortresses should be openly marked with addresses by the central military authorities and forwarded to the Ministry of Interior to be thoroughly prohibited by all levels of police authorities. At the same time, the Ministries of Military Affairs and Foreign Affairs should separately send letters to the embassies of various countries in China and to the local garrisons to comply accordingly. (B) Fundamental Solution: It is found that foreigners often take pictures of various remote and vulgar customs by taking people by surprise or inducing ignorant people with money. The police are not sufficiently deployed, making prevention difficult. It is virtually impossible to impose a blanket prohibition. The fundamental solution is for the Ministry of Education to devise methods to implement social education, raise the people's knowledge, and prevent them from being seduced by foreigners. At the same time, efforts should be made to gradually eliminate inherent vulgar customs, so that foreigners have no way to use their tricks.</p>
<h3>The Case of Sabotage at the Japanese-Chinese Factory Submitted to Arbitration</h3>
<p>The case of sabotage by workers at the Japanese-Chinese Textile Factory, since the Labor Union received a report from the Japanese-Chinese Textile Workers' Union stating that the yarn workers suddenly went on strike on July 19, requesting verification, etc., the bureau dispatched personnel to investigate. According to the investigation report, the factory is divided into two factories, each with more than two thousand workers. The reasons for the strike are: (1) the executive committee of the union did not fulfill its duties, (2) the factory did not accept the conditions proposed by the workers. Regarding the union officials, the municipal party headquarters dispatched a reorganization committee member on July 22. As for the yarn workers, there are three demands: (1) a daily rice subsidy of one dime per person, (2) the shift work system should be discontinued, (3) when workers take leave, they should receive wages at the time of wage distribution without deduction or delay. The reorganization committee and Wu Jiaze, a representative of the municipal party headquarters, repeatedly negotiated with Oikawa, the personnel director of the Japanese-Chinese factory. As a result, the factory's attitude was tough, leaving no room for negotiation, and no resolution could be reached. The Social Affairs Bureau has reported the matter to the municipal government for arbitration. It is now heard that the municipal government has approved the case for arbitration.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Trial</h3>
<p>The Zhou Rangsan Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Police Barrister States the Reasons for the Prosecution</p>
<p>The Victim Proves the Kidnapping and the Actions of the Various Bandits</p>
<p>Zhou Rangsan, a staff member of the Mobil Oil Company and a native of Ningbo, was kidnapped and escaped from the entrance of the Hed Road Yusu Lane the day before yesterday, as detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Jing'an Temple Police Station dispatched Western Sergeant Antewitt, Chinese Detective Fan Defu, Detective Liu Rong, Wang Zhusheng, Lang Jintang, Tao Afu, and Western Detective Gortett, in four cars to arrest the bandits. Eventually, they rescued the victim and successively arrested the kidnapper Jiang Haoyuan from Tongzhou, Yang Miaoquan, Wang Aji (also known as Lai Pi), Zhang Xingbao (also known as Wang's mistress), Qiu Jinpu and other five persons from Changshu woman, killing Wang Da, a bandit party member, on the spot, confiscating two pistols and fifteen bullets, and detaining them separately. The corpse of the bandit was carried into the Philan Road Morgue for examination. Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, the police station</p>
<p>Sent the five male and female prisoners to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court.</p>
<p>Police Prosecution The police barrister Wang Yaotang stood up and stated the case, briefly stating that at 8:50 yesterday morning, the Jing'an Temple Police Station received a phone call from the wife of the plaintiff Zhou Rangsan at No. 1360 Hed Road, stating that her husband had been kidnapped at 8:15. The police station dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and learned that Zhou Rangsan was riding in car No. 2031 at that time, intending to go to the company to handle matters. As soon as he arrived at the lane entrance, he was threatened by the kidnappers with guns and forced the driver Gu Dexing to drive south, passing Yuyuan Road, Kangnaut Road, Daxin Road, and Hongqiao Road. At that time, the driver was chased away by the bandits. Since the police station learned that the incident occurred in the western part of Shanghai, a large team of detectives secretly investigated to the west. Later, Western Sergeant Antewitt, driving alone with the driver Lei Xide, suddenly saw a car coming from the opposite side on Hongqiao Road. The license plate number of the car was clearly No. 2031, which was the car kidnapped by Zhou Rangsan. The sergeant ordered the car to stop, but it did not comply. The sergeant parked his car horizontally in the middle of the road, blocking the way of the oncoming car, and then stopped the car. Only one of the bandits, the driver, was immediately arrested. The bandit was the first defendant Jiang Haoyuan, who confessed the location of the ticket storage, which was in an earth cave near the Hongqiao Road Airport. The cave was used for target practice. The Chinese and Western detectives drove to about 30 yards away from the earth cave and saw a bandit (the defendant Yang Miaoquan) peeking out of the cave. The detectives ambushed and sneaked forward, suddenly capturing him. At that time, there was only one bandit in the cave, guarding the victim with a gun. When he saw his accomplice being arrested, he fled and tried to resist arrest by pulling the trigger. However, the bandit's evil was full, causing the bullet to be stuck by the bolt and unable to be fired. He was about to take out another pistol from his arms to fire, but the Chinese and Western detectives acted first. In an instant, gunfire rumbled and bullets flew, and the bandit was shot several times and fell to the ground and died immediately. The victim was rescued, along with the captured bandits and two pistols, and taken to the police station. Later, Yang Bandit confessed to his accomplice Wang Aqing and went to No. 1049 Siwenli, Datong Road, and arrested Wang and his mistress Zhang Xingbao. Then, at about 1:00 AM this morning, Qiu Jinpu was captured at No. 766 Maigen Road. Qiu was the instigator of the case, and he had worked as a driver for the plaintiff for two weeks five years ago.</p>
<h3>Premeditated Conspiracy This kidnapping of Zhou was decided in Wang Bandit's house in Siwenli.</h3>
<p>It is now known that the defendants had been plotting to kidnap the plaintiff for a long time, this being the third time. The first time was at 8:00 AM on August 20, when the attempted kidnapping failed. The second time was at 8:10 AM on the morning of August 26, when five bandits went together, but the pistol was transported by Shen, who was at large. By the time Shen brought the pistol, the plaintiff had already taken a car to the company, so it failed again. Then, this case occurred yesterday morning, and the guns and bullets were presented to the court.</p>
<h3>The detective reported then according to Western Sergeant Antewitt to prove the</h3>
<p>Circumstances of intercepting the first defendant, and according to Western Detective Gort to explain that the dead bandit Wang Da was killed by him, and according to Chinese Detective Liu Ronggen to confess that the second defendant Yang Miaoquan was arrested by me.</p>
<h3>The victim stated directly the victim Zhou Rangsan submitted,</h3>
<p>People from Zhejiang, 42 years old, have been working at Mobil Oil for a long time. At 8:10 yesterday morning, he took a car to the company, driven by the driver Gu Dexing. When Wang Gensheng was closing the iron gate of the lane entrance, three kidnappers suddenly came with pistols and jumped into the car. The defendant Jiang Haoyuan sat with the driver, and Yang Miaoquan and the deceased sat to my left and right, heading west. In the car, the deceased gave me a pair of black glasses and ordered me to wear them. We drove around for an hour before arriving at the earth cave for a temporary rest. The kidnappers were divided into two groups, one group came to kidnap me, and the other group was scheduled to take over at Daxin Road. Therefore, after the bandits arrived at the earth cave, the first defendant drove my car to Daxin Road to find the replacement group. They were arrested on the way, and then I knew where I was being held and rescued me from danger. The defendant Qiu Jinpu did work as a substitute worker in my office for two weeks, and the deputy driver Gu Dexing and Wang Gensheng also submitted statements.</p>
<p>Order to Reschedule After Judge Sun Yuan verified the confession and questioned the defendants one by one, he ordered the five defendants to be returned to custody separately, waiting for a rescheduled hearing. The detectives took the defendant Yang Miaoquan to the morgue. The court appointed Prosecutor Guo Huaipu to come to the office to verify that the deceased thief's body was indeed killed in the line of duty due to resisting arrest. No family members were found, so the corpse was taken by Pushu Villa for coffin burial.</p>
<h3>Summer's End, Autumn's Cool</h3>
<p>Dysentery Transmission Requires Urgent Prevention</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau Announces Preventive Measures</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice yesterday to prevent the transmission of dysentery, stating: "For the notice, dysentery is a type of infectious disease. The pathogen is the dysentery bacillus or a type of amoeba. The route of transmission is that the pathogen enters the stomach and intestines with food through the mouth. At the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, the disease is especially prone to be rampant. Once transmitted, the harm is extremely severe, and many deaths result, especially among young children. Recent investigations have revealed that such patients have occurred in this city, and prevention and containment should be urgently needed to avoid infectious harm. In order to maintain the health of citizens and prevent the epidemic of dysentery, the bureau hereby publishes a summary of prevention methods and informs our citizens to be aware of prevention at all times. This is essential. This notice is divided into the following preventive measures: 1. Eliminate flies to prevent them from spreading the dysentery pathogen. 2. Choose food carefully to avoid accidentally ingesting the dysentery pathogen. 3. Clean up accumulated dirt. 4. Do not eat cut melons and fruits, because flies have bitten them or they have been sprinkled with raw water, often with dysentery pathogens attached. 5. Do not eat raw and cold foods, because things that have not been boiled often have germs attached. 6. Isolate and treat patients to prevent the spread of pathogens and harm to others. 7. Pay attention to the cleanliness of houses and courtyards. 8. Pay attention to the cleanliness of kitchens and toilets. 9. Pay attention to the cleanliness of food and utensils and the strict storage of containers. 10. The clothes and utensils of patients must be disinfected before they can be reused, because dysentery pathogens may be lurking on them. 11. The excrement and urine of patients should be sterilized with disinfection methods to prevent their spread. 12. If you suffer from dysentery-like symptoms, you should seek medical treatment quickly."</p>

<p>Hu Yongji and Quan Did Not Arrive for the Hearing</p>
<p>Mei Fei, a prostitute (also known as Chen Junxia), was previously sued in the Special District Local Court by Tan Meiying, the wife of Zhao Guangzu from Baoshan, who hired two lawyers, Lu Qi and Zhao Zuwei, for colluding with Hu Yongquan to embezzle a car, force a note, and forge a private seal. The court had summoned them twice, and because there was hope of reconciliation, the hearing was postponed for seven days. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Hu Yongquan did not arrive for the hearing, only Mei Fei and her lawyer Shen Yushan were present. Lawyer Shen stated that since the previous hearing was postponed due to hope of reconciliation, the reconciliation procedures have not been completed so far, so he requested another postponement in order to reconcile. The plaintiff's lawyers Lu Qi and Zhao Zuwei stated that at the previous court hearing, according to Hu's agent, lawyer Liu Zuwang, the car was to be sent to lawyer Zhao's office at 4:00 PM that afternoon, so they requested a postponement, but it was not delivered at the time. Later, they received a phone call from lawyer Liu saying that there was not enough time today and that they would talk again tomorrow, but there was still no news the next day, so it could be seen that the defendant had no sincerity in reconciliation and should proceed with the trial. When questioned, Mei Fei confessed that she knew nothing about the plaintiff's car, and that Hu Yongquan was introduced to her by Zhao Guangzu. Judge Sun approved the defendant Mei Fei to pay 1,000 yuan for bail and wait for Hu Yongquan to be arrested for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>The Kuomintang Society reports that Zhu Qimin, a member of the Ninth Sub-district of the Third District of this city and a candidate executive committee member of the sub-district (who also serves as a reporter for various newspapers), was defrauded of $1,800 of savings by the He Xing Wen Ji and other counterfeit silver companies in the $630,000 fraud case. He was elected as the representative of the creditor group, leading to a lawsuit involving the Pu Li Da Steel Factory founded by the company. After being ordered to post bail by the Shanghai District Court, he was then illegally detained and subjected to insults by the court police. He reported the details to the sub-district and requested that justice be upheld. After receiving the report, the sub-district immediately reported the situation to the superior party headquarters for verification and handling, in order to uphold human rights and demonstrate the rule of law.</p>
<h3>Handgun Hidden in Rags</h3>
<p>Li Zixin and other officers of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, while patrolling the Huangpu River at about 6 a.m. yesterday, found a large bundle of rags placed on the pier near the Great Pier with no one guarding it. They went forward to inspect it and found that there was a hard object blocking the rags, which aroused suspicion. They immediately loosened the rags and found a hidden Browning pistol and two hundred rounds of ammunition. The police re-bundled the rags and waited nearby for a long time, but no one came to retrieve them. They brought the bundle of rags, along with the firearm, to the team. Captain Xu Jishi prepared a document to report to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>

<h3>Westerner's Burglary Quickly Solved</h3>
<p>Large Quantity of Clothing Hidden in Flower Field and Weeds</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 4 a.m., a large quantity of clothing, worth over 1,500 yuan, was stolen from the home of a British man named Arfa in Wusong Fort. A patrol from the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau discovered a man on Outer Ma Road carrying a package, acting flustered. They immediately brought him to the district for interrogation. He confessed that his name was Wang Zhanqian, 26 years old, from Feicheng, Shandong Province. He had previously served in the First Division Training Regiment and had since been discharged. He confessed to stealing a large quantity of clothing from the home of the British man in Wusong Fort and that the clothing in the package had been stolen elsewhere. When asked where he had hidden the clothing stolen from the British man, he refused to confess. District Chief Yang led patrol officer Dai Guosheng and others, along with the suspect, to search the area around Wusong Fort. They found three large packages of the original stolen clothing in a flower field next to the nearby railway, and another large package in the weeds beside the ditch behind the seaside hotel. The victim, the British man Arfa, came to identify the items, confirming that they were all his and that nothing was missing. He was deeply impressed by the Seventh District's quick resolution of the case and said he would report it in the Shanghai Western newspapers to express his gratitude. District Chief Yang ordered the suspect to be taken back to the Seventh District for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Committee</h3>
<p>Letter to the Postal Workers' Unions</p>
<p>The Traffic Workers' Affairs Committee of the Ministry of Communications writes to the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and its union: We recently read your union's telegram to Minister Zhen Ri of this ministry, expressing gratitude that the ten demands raised this time have been substantially resolved. We thank you on behalf of all postal workers and state that previously, the postal authorities were unable to be open and transparent, and disregarded the demands, almost leading to a major upheaval. Therefore, this time, the limited-time response was a last resort. We hope that in the future, suspicions will be abandoned, barriers will be removed, and sincerity will prevail. If postal workers are not insane, they will never harm the postal service on which they depend for their livelihood. The words are concise and profound, and we are greatly impressed. Postal service is a state-run public enterprise that benefits society domestically and all people internationally. All those who serve in it, whether authorities or workers, share the responsibility for division of labor and progress. Even this ministry, at the highest level of management, is in reality an integral part, sharing honor and disgrace, and closely connected. Regarding the reform and innovation of treatment, and the pace of advancement, all should be based on circumstances and handled equitably, aiming not to harm the health of the enterprise and to be in line with the party's broad aim of supporting the interests of farmers and workers. For those that are approved, if they are indeed demands for improving treatment, there is no need to express gratitude. For those that are rejected, since there are indeed difficulties, it is not appropriate to take it to heart. Only in this way will the mind be open and honest, and right and wrong be clear. Even if there are misunderstandings, they should be dispelled immediately. Moreover, managers do not disregard, and this ministry does not harbor suspicion. The postal service has been in operation for over thirty years. It has relied on foreign talent, leading to dominance by foreign guests, with obvious bias and discrimination. At the beginning of the establishment of this ministry, we learned from the past and planned for the future, believing that postal rights must be recovered before improvement could be discussed. We spent several months and went through many twists and turns, and fortunately succeeded. However, at that time, the country was not yet unified, and the postal service was affected by the war, with a sharp decline in income. In the sixteenth year, the surplus was less than 100,000 yuan. The following year, various places temporarily calmed down, and parcels and letters gradually recovered. As a result, the surplus was only over one million yuan. At the same time, treatment was improved, new grades were added, and regulations for pension and compensation were stipulated one after another. Letter sorters were changed to postal assistants, postal students were changed to postal clerks, and the promotion salary rate was increased. According to statistics, the additional expenditure was no less than several hundred thousand yuan. In comparison, expenditure exceeded income, amounting to more than 810,000 yuan. We had no choice but to advance the operating fund for the following year to make up for it (16th year postal affairs annual report). The postal stamps stored over the years gradually used up because they needed to be replaced with new designs, and there was no time to increase them. Various storage materials are decreasing day by day. The current situation can be maintained, but the economic foundation is gradually shaken, and the vitality of the postal service is inevitably damaged. However, this ministry does not ignore the lives of postal workers because of this. Therefore, in the past three years, we have resolutely and decisively improved them at any time and in any matter. On the one hand, we are striving to develop the enterprise, such as planning the establishment of savings and remittance bureaus and expanding new postal lines, all of which are actively pursued with the aim of compensation. We are also concerned that low-level salaried workers often lack education and have difficulty making progress. We have provided them with remedial education. We are also concerned that their family finances are insufficient and that their children have difficulty attending school. We have prepared a consumer cooperative and established elementary schools for their children, and we encourage them to improve themselves by revising the postal examination system. Postal carriers can take the examination to be promoted to postal assistants, and postal assistants can take the examination to be promoted to postal clerks. All of these are only beneficial to the workers and can make them feel at ease in their service. We strive to do our best, and even go beyond the scope of difficulty, and strive to love and protect them. The facts are there, and it is not an exaggeration. Compared with the treatment before the recovery of postal rights, what is the difference? Not only those who are in the situation can review it, but also the general public who pay attention to it all agree. Moreover, China is a country with backward industries, and the whole society is poor. There is only the difference between great poverty and small poverty. Among those who serve in agencies and factories, few can be better than postal workers in terms of treatment and salary, and few can keep pace with them. Therefore, we dare not say that the lives of postal workers have been fully resolved and do not need to be improved. However, considering the current situation of this enterprise and the livelihood of the whole society, it is already relatively high and there is no need to hide it. This ministry and managers have indeed improved the treatment of postal workers in a practical and meticulous way. However, it is unexpected that postal workers still seek perfection. Then, what standard should be used as the ultimate standard for the so-called sincerity and no suspicion of postal workers? Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the reactionary elements have repeatedly risen and tried to endanger the party and the country. The central government has had to use troops to quell the chaos in order to remove obstacles and complete the national revolution, and has endured the pain for a moment and prayed for unification. Those people, under this situation, are also deeply afraid of rapid destruction and unite to resist, resulting in years of war and no peace. Recently, the Yan Feng warlords, the red communists, and the party and political figures who sell themselves for profit, gathered the dregs of corruption and made a final struggle. The enemy's atmosphere and reverse flames spread throughout the Central Plains and the Northwest, and the killings and disturbances occurred in Hunan and Jiangxi. The generals at the front adhere to the legacy of the premier and promote the complete revolution, and are braving the front, wielding blood and flesh, and fighting a desperate battle with the enemy. Those responsible for the rear, regardless of the difference between labor and leisure, even if they endure hardship and sacrifice everything, are doing what they should. Moreover, in the autumn of the development of the situation, reactionary elements everywhere instigate and try to take advantage of the situation. Shanghai is a mixed place of Chinese and foreigners, and there are many hidden dangers. Our postal workers have been influenced by the Three Principles of the People of this party and deeply understand the trend of obedience and rebellion. Although there are many wrong paths, the right path can be followed. This ministry knows that it will not be fooled by others and used. However, being limited by the interests of small groups and not taking the time to assess the situation, we hastily made fierce demands, such as the so-called limited-time response and the so-called near-upheaval. Those who do not know the truth cannot help but regret it and suspect that there are ulterior motives. However, this ministry has always been understanding and has made concessions in the midst of the most difficult circumstances. Who would believe that it is not open and transparent? In short, the postal service is established for the benefit of the whole society. Politics, culture, economy, and industry all have important relations. It should not only be maintained by the postal workers on whom it depends for its livelihood, but also should not be used solely for the purpose of solving the current lives of a part of the people and hindering their progress. This is also the great wish that this ministry has always held, and it is also what all our workers are happy to see and work together to achieve. Let us encourage each other.</p>
<h3>Guiede Recently Suffered War Disaster</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society has now received a telegram from Acting Chairman Zhang of the Henan Provincial Government, stating that the areas of Likou, Gaoxingji, Guocun, and Maogudui under the jurisdiction of Shangqiu, as well as Yangyipu, Jinxiang Temple, and Luozhanggongji under the jurisdiction of Ningling, are located in the impact of the war zone. According to reports, many people have been killed and injured, and those who survived have no means of subsistence. Cries are heard, and the desolation is everywhere. Yesterday, more than 30 village chiefs near Guocun came to the government and complained in person that the dead had not been buried, the injured had not been healed, and the cattle carts, food transport livestock, and vehicles of the residents had been intercepted by the defeated soldiers. Our people cannot be full and cannot cultivate the land, and can only wait for death. The war on the Longhai Front has caused the most severe disasters in Shangqiu and Ningling counties. This time, they have suffered misfortune again, located at the focal point of the bombing, and have been innocently affected. The situation is pitiful. Your society has sympathy and concerns in its heart. Please raise large amounts of money, purchase medicines, and send personnel to Henan to provide relief on a large scale. The telegram cannot express enough hope and is awaiting orders. According to reports, there are many deaths in the war zone, and the epidemic must be severe. The society has now prepared 20,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan and 10,000 bottles of newly made anti-epidemic Jisheng Golden Dan, packed in three wooden boxes. 20,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan will be shipped to Tianjin today by the Taikoo Zhejiang steamer, and then transferred to the Beiping Henan Disaster Relief Association by the director of the society's Tianjin office, She Juisheng, and then transported to the interior for relief. The remaining 10,000 bottles of Jisheng Golden Dan will be shipped by ship in the near future and transferred to the disaster area for relief, in the hope of reversing the great disaster to the extent possible.</p>

<h3>Merchant Ship Robbed Midway</h3>
<p>The other day, Xue Zhiyu from Gaoqiao, Pudong, carrying over 1,000 yuan in cash, hired a pier boat from Xu Guangguan to go to Songjiang to purchase new rice and grain. Xue, knowing that the waterway between Songjiang and Shanghai was unsafe and that bandit gangs sometimes robbed cargo ships, divided the cash of over 1,300 yuan into two packages, one of 1,000 yuan hidden under the stove at the stern of the boat, and the other of over 300 yuan hidden on his person.</p>
<p>In the evening around 7 PM, the boat sailed to the west of Hongqiao in western Shanghai, about two li from Qibao, when it was suddenly approached by a pirate boat carrying six or seven bandits, each wielding box cannons and pistols. They shouted for the boat to stop. The bandits jumped onto Xue's boat, warning the crew not to make a sound, and proceeded to ransack the vessel. Finding nothing of value, they searched Xue and found a silver packet with over 300 yuan and a Zhongshan watch, which they took along with the Xiangyun shirt and trousers he was wearing. The robbers then fled in their boat. Fortunately, the package of 1,000 yuan hidden under the stove was not discovered, so Xue was able to continue to Sijing to purchase goods. He also sent a letter to a rice shop in Nanshi, asking them to report the robbery to the water police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Another Dispute at the Qingyun Li Tenants' Association</h3>
<p>The Qingyun Li Tenants' Association in Hongkou, facing imminent eviction deadlines, decided to launch a large-scale publicity campaign, posting slogans and appointing Tang Huilian as the general commander. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, 36 members set out to begin their work, divided into six groups, assigned by the general commander, to carry out expanded publicity and to post slogans such as "Oppose landlords forcing evictions, strive and fight to the end!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, while they were enthusiastically campaigning in the eighth lane of the neighborhood, a man suddenly appeared and struck Tang on the head with ten porcelain bowls, causing profuse bleeding. All the tenants were outraged by Tang's injury in the line of duty. They immediately took Tang to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, while others searched for the assailant. He was captured on Tiantong Road and handed over to the Chinese police, who took him to the Hongkou police station for questioning. Attorney Chen Tingrui has been engaged to formally prosecute.</p>
<h3>Relocation of the China and Foreign Advertising Agency</h3>

<h3>News from Trade Unions</h3>
<p>Hotels: The Shanghai Hotel Trade Association has an affiliated clinic, which specializes in treating the poor and sick employees and workers of the industry. All are sent for diagnosis and medication. Since its opening a month ago, the clinic has been extremely busy every day. Most of the patients are employees of various hotels, but many are also referred by various sectors of society. On average, there are more than sixty patients per day, mostly suffering from autumn seasonal illnesses. Dr. Zhang Jing'an, a specially appointed physician, meticulously examines the patients, carefully analyzes their pulses, and prescribes medications with utmost care. After the examination, patients are given prescriptions, which can be easily filled at the Qian Zhongde Pharmacy on Six Ma Road. Patients are extremely satisfied and praise the clinic. Most patients recover after taking one or two doses of medicine. The association has already received more than a dozen letters of appreciation, praising its good management and Dr. Zhang's effective treatment. The committee members of the association, seeing such a need among the workers, have made a great vow to expand the scope of the clinic to provide broader relief. It is said that sick workers of other industries can also go to the clinic for consultation without needing a referral note.</p>
<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Newspaper Delivery Workers Union: Yesterday, the 29th regular meeting was held. Resolutions: It has come to our attention that recently, some outsiders, falsely claiming to represent this union, have been causing trouble and creating confusion, leading members to request protection. It is hereby resolved that, henceforth, union members assigned to inspect reactionary publications must be issued inspection certificates by the union to prevent outsiders from impersonating them. Those without inspection certificates shall not be allowed to interfere. It is hoped that all union members will abide by Party training and not sell reactionary tabloids, lest they fall into the legal net. If such incidents occur, the union will hand the cases over for investigation to eliminate malpractices and protect the union's reputation.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Union: The 41st executive committee meeting was held the day before yesterday, chaired by Zhu Xuefan. Formalities were observed. Reports (omitted). Matters for discussion: (1) Inquiry from Beiping and Tianjin regarding the handling of temporary subsidies and allowances for Shanghai Bureau personnel. Resolution: A reply will be sent by telegram, and a detailed letter will be sent explaining the resolution of the ten pending cases. (2) Whenever this union participates in various competitions, no member of this union may represent other organizations to participate in the competition, otherwise, it will be regarded as a violation of the union's discipline. Please vote on the proposal. Resolution: Passed. Announce to all members to abide by it consistently. (3) The ten pending cases of this union and the emergency expense account should be published in detail by the end of this month. Resolution: Passed. Instruct the economic department to handle the adjournment.</p>
<p>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers Union: Yesterday, an emergency meeting was held, chaired by Xu A’gen. The meeting reported on the progress of union affairs, and then discussed and resolved the following: (1) According to reports from workers to the union, the factory is now giving the repair of damaged tram motors to the Huatong Electric Company. This move is actually a conspiracy to harm the workers, intending to reduce the workload of the workers in the factory in preparation for future layoffs. Moreover, since the company was established, this kind of project has never been given to other factories for repair. Resolution: On the one hand, send a letter to Huatong Electric Company advising them not to accept the repair of this project in order to avoid misunderstandings. On the other hand, another proposal should be made to negotiate with the company. (2) Bereavement allowance and retirement payment. Resolution: According to the regulations of the municipal government.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company No. 5 Wharf Workers Union: Yesterday, a standing committee meeting was held, chaired by Yu Xianting. Report: The salary for July has not been paid yet, despite several requests. However, due to the new General Manager Chen not yet taking over, and the acting General Manager Cai, due to his acting capacity, is not responsible. Recently, it was learned that General Manager Chen has firmly resigned to the National Government. It seems that there is no one in charge of the bureau, and the salary is even more uncertain. Discussion: (1) The case of the citizens' rally to celebrate the victory over the rebels on August 29. Resolution: In accordance with the instructions of the Citizens Training Association, the business will be closed for one day. Notify all employees to participate, and inform the General Administration Office. (2) The salary for July has been repeatedly urged without effect. How should it be handled? Resolution: Continue to demand it. (3) No one is responsible for China Merchants. How should it be remedied? Resolution: It is scheduled to invite relevant groups and executive committee members to discuss it at 7 pm on August 28.</p>
<p>Mercerized Dyeing Workers Union: Yesterday, a joint temporary meeting of the executive committee members was held, chaired by Gu Yongquan. Resolutions: (1) All factories will be closed for one day on the 29th. All workers must gather at this union before 8 am, wearing union cards and symbols, and march in formation to participate in the Citizens' Assembly. Those who are absent for excuses will not be paid on that day as a warning. (2) For workers in the Deda and Wansheng factories who refuse to pay union dues, extract their names and post them in the union hall to inform the public. No disputes will be dealt with in the future, and no jobs will be recommended, in order to seek emulation. (3) Recently, some workers have arbitrarily damaged the reputation of the union's committee members and staff outside. Post the factual evidence and file a lawsuit according to law. (4) If unemployed workers continue to rely on unreasonable borrowing of money and disturb the union hall, they should be severely punished. (5) Committee member Xu Yangong's resignation should be retained. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
