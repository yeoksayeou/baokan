<h3>尼泊爾圖併西藏說</h3>
<p>昨報載尼泊爾圖謀併呑西藏。計劃已早定等語。此息出自外人。是否可靠。不敢妄斷。惟吾人驟讀此電。已足生無窮之感慨矣。夫尼泊爾在喜馬拉亞山之中央。介乎西藏與印度間之一小國。面積僅約五萬餘方哩。人口祇百萬。不過較不丹稍大者耳。政權則操之於廓爾喀。族力亦甚弱。何以今日乃有兼併西藏之雄志。其故一因尼泊爾雖亦爲一獨立國。然自與英訂立尼泊爾條約。及西喀利條約後。英得派兵駐守。實際上早已爲英之保護國。故恃英爲後援也一則因西藏之紛亂。自班禪出走。達賴愈專盗。愈益擾攘。故雖有宣布獨立之意。以冀維繫人心。然人心實已向外。亦爲授尼泊爾以勾結之機會也然此問題。實與我大有關係。夫西藏之事之無辦法久矣。我國所以不能不竭力覊糜者。以西藏足爲我西陲屏蔽。間隔强鄰馬足。不致有直接觸之虞也若使尼泊爾之野心。果然實現。則此後不啻與强鄰接境。更可寒心。惟我國人對於邊事。向來漠不關心。川邊交涉。棘手如是。我國人尙坐視其境地之日蹙而不一顧問。西藏之安危向背。更無異於隔岸之觀火必如今日日之滿蒙問題閙至如此。始稍稍有人注意。然大多數。則仍慒然。罔覺此邊事之所以不可爲竊顧我國人有幡然覺悟之一日也國内要電二</p>

<h3>菲島華會中新奇得獎法</h3>

<p>爲推廣營業計劃。然憑倖運而得彩。屬賭博性質。爲此地法律所厲禁。必藉智力心思以角逐。亦熱閙場中一趣事也。</p>

<h3>癲人嚙犬記</h3>
<p>— 芳菲</p>
<p>癲犬嚙人。能致人於死。世頗視爲可怖之事。近有戚人自西興來。述該處去年曾發生一癲人嚙犬之新聞。記之頗足資嗢噱。先是。該村有以養蠶起家之楊姓。弟兄四人均無所出。惟二房早年曾螟蛉一子。衆都認爲唯一之嗣續。子亦殊聰慧。曾負笈皖之一中。學業斐然。前年忽以騎自行車故。墮水溺死。其父痛之甚。終日斐鬱。見人軱泣稱楊氏無後。人或勸其别螟蛉一子。加以造就。又安知其必不如前子。楊謂天不予楊氏以嗣裔。縱有百假子。亦不可恃。聞者都笑其迂。乃積鬱久之。楊之神經竟漸有異徵。匝月而後。成爲癲人。終日啼哭鬭毆。絶無理性。其家人遂幽之於複室中。不令外出。數日後。神態較復原。苦求縱其出遊。因以二健漢伴之至村中各處游散。途値村犬向其狂吠。楊忽躍進。擒犬項。緊抱之於懹中。遽以口嚙犬鼻。犬大嘷。健漢爭前解救。碭遂擲犬大哭云。適見兒來。故抱而親其輔頰。奈何竟變爲一犬也。村人知其癲疾復發。仍幽之原室。旋即病殁。犬則因受創不重。以藥治之。得不死。但鼻之周圍。現有嚙痕甚深。狀如生成。見之已不復如前之勇猛善吠。似有所畏也。</p>
<h3>新流行的鸚鵡病</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>近來歐洲諸國。新流行一種怪症。其病稱爲鸚鵡。我國報紙。亦多記載。惟略焉不詳。茲覓得西國雜誌。節譯若干俾明眞相。</p>
<p>病之起源此次鸚鵡病之發生。最初患者爲司丹坡鼐地方湯墨土醫藥師。病烈時經醫會診斷。久久不能定其起因。嗣偶問其是否蓄有鸚鵡。始瞭然於該鳥之傳染。困此鸚鵡病之名。亦轟傳一時。</p>
<p>病之蔓延現在德之柏林。因有南海羣島載來鸚鵡入口。據各處報告。傳染甚烈。死者三人。已證實確患鸚鵡症。故當道對於輸入鸚鵡。槪須嚴查。且在必要時。嚴禁其登陸。至豢養之家。亦令其勿與鸚鵡接觸。</p>
<p>病之現象鸚鵡患有流行性熱症。即能傳染及人。發時肺部起炎。體熱奇增。惟人與人間。並無互防染及之必要。　　從前記錄　考查以前歷史。英國至一千九百二十七年止。曾患鸚鵡症而死者祇三人。又一千八百九十二年。有鸚鵡五百頭輸入巴黎。其中三百頭先後病死。結果傳染人民。有四十六人同時患病。死亡者竟達十六人之多。</p>
<h3>風筝雋話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>春序方始。嫩柳舒靑。放筝其時矣。風筝一名紙鳶。又名鷂子。由來已古。誠齋雜記。韓信約豨從中起。及作紙鳶放之。以量未央宮遠近。又獨異誌。侯景圍臺城。簡文作紙鳶。飛空告急於外。則紙鳶不但游戲之具已也。又詢芻錄。五代李鄴。於宮中作鳶。引線乘風爲戲。後於鳶首以竹爲笛。使風入竹。聲如筝鳴。故名風筝。按此則弦者。始得以風筝爲名。非尋常之紙鳶报所得襲稱也。</p>
<p>纸鳶之形式。紮匠往往鈎心鬥角爲之。或爲百足之蟲。或爲雙翅之蝶。他若鵬之奮。鯤之游。嬋娟子之妙態。無不畢現於雲表。蔚爲奇觀。扶桑人有倣之爲雙燕者。製作益具巧思。放之則頡頏差池。不啻迎春比翼也。</p>
<p>放風筝宜在郊原。否則電線如蛛網。易於　。且干警例。爲此戲者。不可不知也。有於夜間放風筝而懸燈於線端者。燦燦天上。與星月爭輝。再加以弦。高風吹動。風韻冷然。尤極視聽之娱。</p>
<p>岡中人士。重陽日。每在鳥石山、于山、屏山。競放風。則於登高插萸之外。更添一韻事矣。</p>
<p>味蒓園。曩爲滬上勝地。某年春日。園主人發起一風筝會。中西人士。競翔齊翺。眞有如揚譽所謂膺繫纎纓。趾續長繩。極一時之盛事。吳友如曾圖之。以入畫寳。</p>
<p>予曩有後風筝誤記事文一則云。趙州某氏女。喜放風筝。一日落於某園。園主人之女。少年喜事。拾得風筝。知爲某氏女之物。題詩一絶於上。遣人送還之。女亦和詩。使僕酬某少年。少年得之狂喜。顧女早已字人。其後流言日滋。女之父母聞之在而責女。遂自縊死。實無他也。不過弄筆之誤耳。聞者惜之。其時有莊柳門者。才而佻薄。曾以事與女之父涉訟。故銜之。譜爲後風筝誤傳奇。實多誣衊語也</p>
<h3>言菊朋灌片之趣史</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>蓓開唱片之優點。各報已競載之矣。茲篇所述。乃名伶言菊朋灌唱探母坐宮時之一小小趣事也。</p>
<p>坐宮「楊延輝」慢板西皮一大段。老譚曾有唱片行世。惟以鐘點關係。僅唱至「來到北番」爲止。「我有心過營去見母一面」至「母子們要相逢夢裏團圓」六句。則略而未唱。購片者皆以未窥全豹爲恨。蓓開收音時。對於此劇。曾費長時間之研究。僉以此劇惟言菊朋能傳老譚之衣缽。乃决定邀請菊朋灌收此劇。以補老譚之不足。不料菊朋以珠玉當前。不肯輕易嘗試。詢其故。則曰孔夫子門前。焉敢舞弄文墨。且此劇識者甚多。些微之疵。輙能予人以指摘。萬一厚臉灌入片中。不知其事者。將笑我爲膽大妄爲。而加我以譚氏罪人之名矣。言已。再三長揖。遜謝不遑。余以其意志堅决。亦不復相强。翌日晤面。菊朋似有轉意。惟須由余在報上聲明出於被動字樣。余曰。是有何難。他日自當遵命。首尾完全之坐宮。至乃始告成功。有知其經過者。輙以言菊朋被梅花館主强姦之辭相謔云。（按此片刻已發行。成續至佳。輿論亦至美。俱謂菊朋之聲調。颇有老譚之神　。此片行世。定能博得佳譽也。）</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>打翻火油燈。切勿拿冷水來潑。非但無效。反把水力增大。最好拿棉被壓之。立刻熄滅。雖然損污了一條棉被。但是禍却不闖了。</p>
<p>出門旅行。切勿和不相識的人互通姓名。掉換卡片。尤其是在輪船火車旅館中。最要當心。因爲恐怕遇見歹人。拿了你的姓名和卡片去招搖撞騙。不可不愼。</p>
<p>别的事情可以介紹。惟有醫生却不可。醫好了果然有功。醫壤了就要歸罪介於紹人了。</p>
<p>送禮給親友。要揀投其所好。合於實用。否則徒耗金錢。所謂「寳劍贈與烈士。紅粉送與佳人。」就是這個意思。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一三七）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回諸名士鬧笑捉迷藏一嬌任情施擁護　　自從這一回。左詩晨在明鏡俱樂部請過客以後。每有什麽應酬。不論是吃花洒啊。吃館子啊。凡是友朋輩提倡呌局的。左詩晨總是呌蕊雲的局。向來他對於呌局是無可無不可的。現在他見人家不提倡。他也忍不住提倡呌局了。到了吃館子的時候。起初他希望人家說呌局。人家一說呌局。他忙不迭的說道我來寫局票。萬一人家都不響。他就要說何不呌幾個堂唱來熱閙熱閙呢。他常常的這樣說着。人家鼓起興來。那末他就寫了蕊的堂唱。要是逢着人家請他吃花酒呢。他是不大會打牌的。看着别人在打牌。他說還是呌個堂唱來解解厭氣。不知不覺伸手到都盛盤裏取了局票。寫了蕊雲的名字。敎房間裏發出去了。到蕊雲來了以後。從前覺得没有什麽話可講的。現在平空好像多出許多話來講了。其實都是毫不相干。或者說是今天在路上看見一個癡子。左詩晨便問伊是男人。或是女人。伊說是個女人呀。人家說伊是花癡。年紀很輕。不過二十多歲。有人說伊是生了想思病想癡了的。怎麽呌做花癡呢。於是問題就來了。言語就多了。或者說昨天晚上。我們生意上的隔壁。死了一個相帮呀。據說是急痧。不到十二個鐘頭。已經死了。於是伊便要問爲甚麽死得這樣的快。死過以後。有鬼没有鬼。左詩晨笑道。我又没死過。怎麽會知道呢。伊道。你讀過書。書上總有得講的呀。一回兒又說大阿姨伊說看見過鬼。鬼是有的呀。諸如此類的言語。其實毫不相干。左詩晨却歡伊那種天眞爛漫。一本正經的神情。而且講起話。又是指手畫脚的樣子。故意的逗伊說話。可是人家看了。以爲他們兩人情話娓娓。交頭接耳的不知講些什麽。其實可講的都是别人家的事。一個十五歲的小姑娘。並不十分知道什麽情愛。伊很想游玩。但是伊的職業。伊的生活。不許伊有游玩的餘榕。自從伊掛了牌子出了堂唱以來。每天只要電燈一亮。就是伊打扮好了。坐了包車。從這家堂子。跑到那家堂子。從這家菜館。跑到那家茶館。一直要到十二點鐘以後。總算一天的工作完畢。因爲堂唱多。每天總要三四十個。到了夜裏。也就疲倦極了。頭剛着枕。便即睡去。</p>
<p>到了明天晚上。又是如此。</p>

<h3>二月紗交割紀略</h3>
<p>二月份標紗、月初適値廢歷年頭、金價洶湧奔騰、人心大受刺激、於是散户紛起扒空、同時某紗廠之大户、又堅持不吐、形勢極堅、最高達一百六十六兩六錢、迄乎紅盤開出、以美棉暴落一百餘磅音、各廠底貨日增、跌風大熾、嗣至二十號外、海外花紗、一致續跌、北方時局不寗、長江路生意停滯、加以内地帮因去歲年成荒歉、布廠停工者甚多、銷路竟告杜绝、市盤及愈趨愈下、雖有某紗廠强力拉緊、然亦無補於事、最小價到一百五十四兩七錢、結果交割價爲一百五十六兩、總値一二七一四○○兩、自行交割計七百五十包、實行交割計七千四百包、共計八千一百五十包、計二十支五福二千四百包、牧羊二·三○○、十六支地球八五○十支三羊三○○、帆船二○○、鴻福二○○、紅荷豐五○、雙喜二五○地球五○、也雀八○○、收貨恒大天隆爲最巨、交貨義成天成爲最巨、茲將收交兩方經紀人及額量分誌於後、</p>

<h3>二月份漢標交割之經過</h3>
<p>交割價三十五兩…額達三千二百担　　二月份漢標在前上兩月因金價狂漲、漢路來源缺乏、市價高過滬埠、人心因此趨堅、漢帮粉紛購進、包額頗巨、市氣萬分堅硬、最高曾到三十六兩二三錢、今春紅盤開始、驟落七八錢、以美棉暴跌百餘磅音、人心恐慌、散多賣出、但有實力之多方、依然拉緊不放、後以棉市價頗廉、各洋行且特别遷就抖售、各廠購訂者日鉅、最低到三十四兩、嗣至月末、因交貨者缺乏、買方不顧放鬆、又回漲至三十五兩四錢、結果交割價爲三十五兩、總値元十一萬一千兩、交割數共計三千二百擔、恒大收進一千擔、交貨者祇愼昌六百擔、茲將收交兩方經紀人牌號及額量分誌列左、</p>

<h3>糧食米市銷活續堅</h3>
<p>閘北昨日各路來船見接、市銷仍活、常錫北粳貨客扳售、高貨轉穏、中關續堅、大盤祇半角上落、惟售户賣價不一、因進胃心意濃淡不同所致也、薄稻去路略殷、到貨頗連、行情不易向榮、勉守原盤、羊秈高貨來源不旺、需要甚殷、價格微緊、中次受敏黨大絞而銷淡、價格平平、杜子秈與客埠秈零拆活動、且價回軟後、客胃見佳、盤面提漲半角之贈、白元直銷不如滬南之爽、行情困此疲軟、兼底貨尙厚、暫無轉機之可能也</p>
<p>滬南晨間到米船二十號左右、常蘇錫同等機粳因有鄉莊及崇通等客路採辦、故去化告暢、行情見昂角半、惟斯貨交易均小票、南帮靑角練塘等薄早稻本街胃口滯鏡、且來源踴躍、存底充足、價格平疲、特高貨已跌進十六元關内矣、羊杜秈外帮續有買胃、市勢俏俐、大盤因西貢欠佳關係、祇稍升近尺、頂秈價在十六元五角左右、通變了陰化到銷兩敵、吊胃仍揀高進、市態堅定、</p>

<h3>期麥疲後之大反動</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均見猛烈之反漲、以洋麥旣報振、粉市亦步帶高、因之近期幾個月份、人心大震、買氣甚亟、查此種狀態、實因前幾日跌勢過狂、致一遇機會、反漲亦甚烈也、結果三月份較前日回漲六分、七月份回漲七分之巨、六七月份新麥、人心雖佳、漲勢尙平、六月份祇較好二分、七月份好一分、現麥市面、價尙平穏、因標準雖見回漲、亦不過到五兩零五分左右、故各檔高貨、與標準相仿、中次則進五兩一關、開宿遷麥五兩零六分、瑤灣麥五兩零五分、淸江浦麥五兩零四分、明光麥五兩零一分、揚州麥四兩九錢九分、共開二千餘包云、</p>

<p>疋頭市况、自時局發生謠諑以來、逐步下落大有一厥不振之槪、至昨始轉挻實以連日金市漲風甚烈、成本又被帶高、致行家態度稍堅、昨東貨之第一功直貢緞·六磅郭巨紅標·等均漲二釐半至二分半、但實銷因時局關係、人心不定川帮迄今未動、惟漢帮昨運去有一百餘件、就中以福壽漂布較多、價開八兩四錢、江西長沙二帮亦尙活潑其餘一致無神、本街交易以花色辦去較多、大路貨殊靜、新到三色子貢呢走銷頗爲暢達、榮華富貴開二錢三分、御花園二錢二分半、藍條色汀亦有添辦、兒孫福紫金山新條俱一錢七分、寒山寺紫金山一錢六分七釐半、可愛美人一錢六分半、西貨素府綢昨略見漲、蓋今歲到貨頗少、故執貨者心思看高、義記雙蝴蝶、洛士利十美圖四錢八分法半云、</p>
<h3>五金各貨價隨滙率趨高</h3>
<p>昨外滙步步緊縮、五金各貨成本、於無形中提高不少、故在市塲上開出各貨、較之上日又漲數錢、如英美馬口鐵昨開十兩○六錢半（九十磅英貨）、及十一兩四錢　（一百磅英貨）、美貨九十磅則估十一兩七錢半、一百磅十二兩五錢、白鐵瓦二十四號十兩○五錢、二十六號十一兩七錢半、二十八號十二兩二錢半、英鋼板二釐半八兩七錢半、五釐六兩一錢半、七釐半六兩五錢一分、六兩一錢、十八張黑鐵皮八兩七錢半、十三張九兩二錢半、一寸至六寸元釘六兩七錢半、其他各五金品亦帶高數錢不等、惟交易一層、則因漲風太速、殊無開出云、</p>

<h3>除夕劉雴卿</h3>
<p>由異國寄回來的一封信</p>
<p>世君吾姊、</p>
<p>「韶華不爲少年留」、眞的、現在我已深深地感覺着時日的無情了、去年的除夕、你們都是温柔的投在慈母的懷裏、我在海上漂泊、妹妹覊旅湖南省四中學、那時你寫信告訴我、在臘月三十日的一天、當女僕與嫂嫂把過年的菜飯排滿了一圓桌、大家圍着吃年飯的時候、母親爲了思念兩個天涯漂零的女兒、那些美好的菜飯、她也不能下咽、因爲她的喉嚨被眼淚塞住了、姐姐呀、今年的今日、我又被生活驅到寂寞的異國了、我們那聰明可愛的妹妹、已被病魔和金錢、擁護她做了土國的王后、今天母親的眼淚、不知道要比往年多若干倍呵、</p>
<p>海外的僑民、還是保守着舊年的古風、到三十的這天、如中國一樣照例的吃年夜飯、穿新衣服、敬神拜祖、放鞭炮等等新年的表示、姐姐呀、你猜我聽見了這種聲音、應當作如何的感想呢、</p>
<p>在國内的學校放年假總是在半月以前、但在這兒則不然、今日雖然是臘三十日、惠卿學校也没有放假、因爲是那頑固的校長、要討那些一字不識而很有錢的校董們的歡心、臘月三十要上課、就表示他是一個熱心敎育的敎室家、惠卿去上課、我也陪她去了、我躱在校院的綠陰深處看書、她死死地守在敎育裏、握着敎鞭、摸着粉條、提高嗓子、站在敎壇上饒舌、　　她六點鐘的課畢、已經是午後三時了、我們同回寄宿舍、飢餓催迫我們走到那低矮的房子裏去尋找食物、呵、我們的洋鐵小鍋、黄銅汽爐、磁碗、骨筷等等、都被女僕偷跑了、我們的年夜飯、自然成了畫餅、想到外面去買一點點心來當年夜夜飯、因初到此地、語言不以通、就是說一句話也很感困難、但我們子除知道麵包的譯音叫「老帝兒」而外、什麽食物的名稱也不懂、那末、我們的年夜飯、自然就是兩個麵包了、</p>
<p>午後三時許、有幾個學生家裏送些點心水菓·冰汽水來、我們明天的糧餉、也可以說是明年的糧餉、算是有着落了、我們在國外雖然是很艱苦、也很寂寞、但是我總感覺很幸福一樣、因爲異國裏的這種特殊的生活、似乎還有點趣味、</p>
<p>外面的空氣傳來一陣嘈雜而還夾着一縷尖銳刺耳的聲音、待我出去一看、原來是士人跳舞以享樂資本家、有兩個年方二八的少女、皮膚若燻黄的臘肉、胸部與腿部用椰樹毛編成的舞衣遮蓋着、耳上戴着雞蛋大的銅耳垂、手中拿紅紗、舞時活潑自然、我想、要是這種女子在文明的國度裏、加以訓練、她的藝術未嘗不會高超優美、這種舞蹈、是我有生以來才看見過的、因爲今日是新年、是有錢的人們快樂的日子、像我們今天肚中還没有一粒飯的人、飽飽眼福、也夠滿足了、</p>
<p>街上的一些小孩子、穿着新衣、站在門外、手裏拿鞭砲在頑要、我不禁又想到我幼小時候的事了、在新年還未來之前、哥已從學校裏回來、他寫對聯、總是要我磨墨、那時、我一點小手、磨一盤濃墨是多磨不容易呵、於是我與他定下的條件是、一盤濃墨換一掛大的瀏陽鞭砲、後來、我的小木書匣子裏裝滿了、到了三十的晚上、母親爲我穿了花衣兒、胸面掛着用紅索編成像蛇一樣的壓歲錢、手裏也拿着許多鞭砲與香火、站在門前像這些小孩子一樣的游戲、那時候、我非常快樂、因此我很希望新年來到、新年好像是小孩子無窮的希望、牠也就是老人悲哀的失望、</p>
<p>在國内的今晚、家家都要關門閉户、全家大小圍着火爐守歲、默默的度過幸福的新年、這里新年的情形、與國内完全不同家家户户的門前、雖然是張燈掛彩可是一些人們都是穿着紗羅綢緞、拿着團團的扇子、坐在燦爛的燈光照耀得很輝煌的廊檐下乘凉、到處只聽見亂耳的喧譁聲、嘈雜的鼓鑼聲、劈拍的鞭砲聲、這種種聲音雜在一起在這種炎熱的天氣、乾燥的空氣中、越發使人難耐了於是我與惠卿便從這種臭惡的空氣中逃到公園裏去尋找風的影兒、我的眼珠完全落在那些呆笨的站着的樹梢頭、枝兒葉兒彷彿睡覺了似的、周圍的百靈們、都靜悄悄的沈默着</p>
<p>我們慢慢的踱到池邊、有許多初次與我的眼廉相觸的男男女女、也坐在這里等候風神的降臨、我們坐在橋頭的長橙上、對面一條大河岸上的燈火倒影水中、金光萬道、眞是美麗無比、</p>
<p>今年的除夕、我尋着了多少回憶的珍寳、也拾得了多少異國裏的請調、這一切的一切都是我的心田裏種下的回憶的種子、我總怕收穫的時候有些難受呵、　　妹月影由異國寄、</p>
<h3>牛芬蘭島瑪勒人的結婚與邪術昌溪</h3>
<p>在英國殖民地牛芬蘭島上的瑪勒（Maori)土人、是一個很特異的種族、在經過數十年白種人的經營後、他們還是没有多大的進步、仍然行着酋長的制度、在許多地方與白種人立於相敵的地位、</p>
<p>最近布朗（C　R　Browne）把他在瑪勒人的拘留中、冒險寫成了瑪勒人的邪術、（Ｍapri　Witcherv）這書是一册很有趣味的富於蠻荒描寫的書、關於那次白種人要在該島修建鐵路時被瑪勒人捕去的莫法特（Mollatt）禁錮着情形是、　　我想他們待遇一個俘虜是如是此的美善、在白種人的監獄中也未曾有過、然而過幾天以後、有些小孩子從𨻶縫裏窺察�</p>
<p>我們而互相的語道、哦、這些東西是長肥了、唉、是殺他們的時候了、這使我很焦急的思想我的危險的地位、我决定竭力設法的脫逃、</p>
<p>無疑的、我也是在這羣被殺的中、我是不免要被他們這些野蠻的生番殺來呑食呀、」</p>
<p>但是他並未得脫逃、反轉得了自由、把他們放回去了、這羣人中就是作者布朗先生也在内、他在出獄後反在長時間的與他們的相處而與一個瑪勒女子結婚、那女子的名字呌特·愛丢（Ｔe　Artu）是出自土人中貴族的美麗的女子、是酋長恩特（Ngatae）的親屬、結婚的儀式很簡單、在全村的人民舉行了跳舞後便如此的對於新郎新婦作一個嚴重的宣誓的儀式、</p>
<p>「這裏有一個很重要的問題要問你、巴那」（Ｐara）酋長如此的說着、「那便是你允不允許常常對特愛丢忠實、在她生存的時候、你决不與其他的任何婦人發生關係、」</p>
<p>「我很喜歡的允許那樣、呵、恩特、」我回答着、</p>
<p>於是酋長高聲而明亮的呌道、「呵、杜哈（Ｔuhva）的人民、我的姪女的親屬、你們願意這個白種巴那作特愛丢的丈夫嗎、」</p>
<p>他們都同聲的叫道、「唉、」只有那個宛如白種人中的大僧正的托黑阿拉（Tojjhiora)不表示贊同、</p>
<p>其實他在瑪勒族中的地位很高、當酋長向我和新婦演講並告訴我們的結婚是適宜的以後、大僧正便起立來咒詛我、他說我們的結婚不能長久、不久便要死亡、</p>
<p>布朗說他以後並不曾回到他所愛的人那裏、他們的住宅是被人毁滅、而他的新婦呢、因爲那主持邪術的大僧正認爲不祥、以後便在丈夫不在家的時候、由他監督着把她弄死了、</p>

After investigating, Division Commander Hucheng strongly advocates for the suppression of Yan and is willing to be the vanguard in the suppression of Yan. During my recent trip to Shaanxi, he instructed me to seize the opportunity to volunteer to your excellency. This telegram is no different from the impersonation by the rebel Tang last year and is clearly a false listing. It is completely untrustworthy.

<p>Important Tree Planting Wang Yi Gift</p>
<h3>Quickly Select a Large Number of Tree Seedlings</h3>
<p>—Solving the People's Livelihood Problems: Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation—</p>
<p>The spring air has permeated; comrades, hurry up and work hard!</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's People's Livelihood is about clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Anyone with a bit of knowledge should know this. Sen Shengyuan has prepared a variety of seedlings. Planting them will ensure housing and transportation. We also have improved agricultural seeds. Planting them will guarantee clothing and food. Recently, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Military Affairs has inscribed four characters: "Related to the People's Livelihood." Please don't misunderstand. What is "Related to the People's Livelihood" is tied to agriculture and forestry, and is not tied to Sen Shengyuan. This is the true explanation, and Sen Shengyuan is not being polite. Without empty talk, let me talk about the prices. Masson pine is ten yuan per 10,000 seedlings, pagoda pine is one thousand yuan per 10,000 seedlings, cypress is four hundred yuan per 10,000 seedlings, paper mulberry is eighty yuan per 10,000 seedlings, palm tree is eight hundred yuan per 10,000 seedlings, maple poplar is two hundred and fifty yuan per 10,000 seedlings, Chinese holly is one hundred and forty yuan per 10,000 seedlings, trifoliate orange is seventy yuan per 10,000 seedlings, black locust is four hundred yuan per 10,000 seedlings, elm is one hundred and eighty yuan per 10,000 seedlings, and goldenrain tree is eight hundred yuan per 10,000 seedlings. The prices for other dozens of species such as elm, cedar, mulberry, camphor, poplar, etc. are difficult to list in full. Detailed catalogs are printed; just send a letter to request them. The Sen Shengyuan Agricultural and Forestry Company has a sales office in Yao Yiwan, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. —(If you kindly enclose ten cents for postage, you will be gifted four bags of flower seeds.)</p>
<p>Also available are 60 kinds of beautiful flower seeds for three yuan, white pyrethrum seedlings for only one hundred yuan per 10,000 seedlings, daffodils for one and a half yuan per dozen, lilies for three yuan per dozen, gladiolus for 20 yuan per 100 bulbs, and tulips at the same price. Flower and fruit tree seedlings, shade trees, and agricultural seeds are all available without omissions.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Theory That Nepal Intends to Annex Tibet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Nepal intends to annex Tibet, and the plan has been decided long ago. This news comes from foreigners. Whether it is reliable cannot be recklessly determined. However, when we suddenly read this telegram, it is enough to generate endless feelings. Nepal is a small country in the center of the Himalayas, between Tibet and India. It has an area of only about 50,000 square miles and a population of only one million. It is only slightly larger than Bhutan. Political power is controlled by the Gurkhas, and the ethnic strength is also very weak. Why does it have the ambition to annex Tibet today? One reason is that although Nepal is also an independent country, since it signed the Treaty of Nepal and the Treaty of West Sikri with the British, Britain has been able to station troops there. In fact, it has long been a British protectorate and relies on Britain as a backing. Another reason is the turmoil in Tibet. Since the Panchen Lama left, the Dalai Lama has become more authoritarian and increasingly causes disturbances. Therefore, although he has declared independence in an attempt to maintain popular support, the people's hearts have actually turned outward, which also gives Nepal the opportunity to collude. However, this issue is very related to us. The Tibetan issue has been unresolved for a long time. The reason why our country cannot but try its best to restrain it is that Tibet is sufficient to shield our western border and separate the hooves of strong neighbors, so that there is no direct risk of touching it. If Nepal's ambitions are realized, then we will be bordering a strong neighbor, which is even more chilling. However, our people have always been indifferent to border affairs. The Sichuan-Tibet negotiations are so difficult, but our people still sit and watch the shrinking of its territory without even asking a question. The safety of Tibet is no different from watching a fire from the other side of the river. It is not until the Manchuria-Mongolia issue has reached such a point today that people have begun to pay attention. However, the majority are still ignorant and unaware of why this border matter cannot be handled. I hope that one day our people will have a sudden awakening. Domestic Important Telegrams 2</p>

<h3>Chiefs of the Five Powers Gather for Deliberation at the London Naval Conference</h3>
<p>Decided to Proceed with Discussions in Sections</p>
<p>A Three-Power Agreement is Not Easily Concluded</p>
<p>British Navy Faction Opposes Further Naval Reduction</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 26th: The Naval Disarmament Conference adjourned for two weeks and reconvened at the British Prime Minister's Office in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 26th. As a result, the structure of the conference was changed, dividing it into (1) the European Section and (2) the Maritime Section. The former includes Britain, France, and Italy, while the latter includes Britain, Japan, and the United States. Direct stakeholders will negotiate, and it was decided to proceed with discussions as quickly as possible. However, the results of the sectional meetings are not final decisions but are considered temporary proposals that still require the decision of the Five-Power Conference. This proposal was created by Prime Minister MacDonald to break the deadlock. Therefore, the current conference is, in fact, being conducted only between Britain, Japan, and the United States. The European Section must wait for the completion of the French cabinet formation and the dispatch of representatives before it can convene. The British, Japanese, and American conference that convened on the 17th has, in fact, entered the main topic and has temporarily dominated the central stage of the conference. Important negotiations between the three countries, including Japan's 70% proposal, will be the focus of discussion next week.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 26th: The Disarmament Conference has a tendency to continue with four countries regardless of the French political changes. The four Japanese plenipotentiaries gathered at Wakatsuki's residence today to discuss this matter. As a result, it seems inappropriate to exclude France and continue the conference. They all agreed to continue the adjournment temporarily until the French plenipotentiaries arrive. Mr. Wakatsuki told people that although Japan would not automatically propose another adjournment, such a situation might arise after discussions with other countries. Private negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Japan, although during the adjournment, are still very free. As long as Britain and the United States initiate it, they can respond at any time.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: Today's communique states that the chief representatives of the United States, Japan, and Italy met with the French ambassador this afternoon to consider the continuation of the work of the naval conference. It was then agreed that if France agrees, the naval conference will immediately resume its full activities, and the original work procedures must be followed. At the same time, private talks between the representatives are continuing, and the work of the staff committee is making good progress. British officials believe that this communique has indicated that the conference is proceeding as before, so the widely rumored Three-Power Agreement will be extinguished. Also, a British official spokesperson stated that the naval conference is still lively and quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th: The Naval League held a meeting in London today and passed a resolution opposing the continued reduction of the British Navy. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Churchill, who was in charge of the navy from 1911 to 1915, spoke out against the current government's weakness at the naval conference. He said that other participating countries are preparing to increase their relative naval power, while Britain, which first advocated reducing land, sea, and air armaments, must not only reduce its actual naval power but also its relative power. He also said that the size of the US Navy is irrelevant to Britain. Britain only needs to build the navy that its parliament deems indispensable for national security after listening to the loyal plans of its naval authorities. Churchill also said that if each representative presents its naval program for the next five or six years, an agreement may be reached.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Masaryk, he was a blacksmith in Vienna in his youth, devoted himself to philosophy, literature, and political science, and then became a teacher and university professor.

<h3>Dominican Revolutionary Army Occupies the Capital</h3>

Associated Press, Dominican Capital, 26th: Since the revolutionary army entered the capital, gunshots have been heard since nightfall. All hotels and shops are closed. However, the government and the revolutionary army have high hopes for a peaceful resolution. The government has invited Ulnar, who claims to be the supreme commander of the revolution, to discuss terms. President Vasquez and US Ambassador Curtis will participate in the negotiations. As for the gunshots at night, it is not yet clear whether they were blank shots or live ammunition.</p>
<h3>Committee to Amend the League of Nations Charter Finds "Just War" Difficult to Define</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 26th: The committee to amend the Charter of the League of Nations to align with the Kellogg-Briand Pact is now finding it difficult to define "Just War" (Permissible War) appropriately. Sir Cecil proposed that it should be interpreted as a war of national self-defense and international sanctions. However, regarding international sanctions, a statement should be added that it is an act of maintaining international peace. However, the chairman of the committee opposed this proposal, saying that the term national self-defense can be interpreted in various ways, is very flexible, and is too vague. From this alone, we can see that the nature of the discussions of the committee is unusually complex, so the future is not bright.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Receives the Press</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 27th in the Central Second Conference Hall. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Liu Luyin chaired the meeting and reported to the reporters, stating that since Yan Xishan sent out the Zeng Xiao telegrams, their content has been deeply known to the people of the country. Today, the Central Government has received the Yang telegram from Yan, the content of which is even more bizarre than the previous telegrams. Although the telegrams repeatedly sent by Yan appear peaceful on the surface, they are actually preparing to use force, nominally seeking the unity of the entire party, but in reality, they are a grand alliance of warlords, bureaucrats, imperialist running dogs, and local bandit leaders. As for the generals who signed the Yang telegram, many of them were using false names, and some had no connection with Yan or had long been relieved of their military power. In addition, there were many bandit leaders who were also signed in. The content of the telegram advocated a national consensus to decide on national policies. Yan's intention was nothing more than to unite the Anfu clique, the Research clique, Zhang Zongchang, Wu Peifu, Duan Qirui, and others into one force. Yan has also claimed that Shanxi's autonomy has been quite successful and that he is the only one who can resolve national policies. In fact, according to the latest investigations, Yan's policy of governing Shanxi is to find ways to make all useful talents leave Shanxi or make them addicted to opium. The so-called village chiefs, district chiefs, and township chiefs are all addicted to opium. It is rumored that Yan will organize a temporary government in Beiping, with Feng in charge of military affairs and Yan in charge of internal affairs. If this rumor is true, it will at most lead to a situation where opium addiction is rampant throughout Shanxi. Also, Shanxi's annual income is about 20 million, while consumer spending requires 60 million, resulting in a financial deficit. Therefore, Yan has taken all the cash from several provinces, including Hebei, and circulated Shanxi paper money in provinces such as Hebei. Yan also said that the South has boundaries with the North, but in fact, Yan only uses people from Shanxi, which is purely feudal thinking. Now Yan has entered a dead end and wants to deceive the people of the country in the name of concession. In fact, even the people of Shanxi and Hebei will not be deceived by this kind of rhetoric. Now, the only way to deal with Yan is to ask the people of the country to give Yan a final general judgment with justice and revolutionary theory, without having to reason with him. As for the people in the North, they have expressed their resistance to Yan's actions. Although Yan does not dare to openly close down mass organizations and institutions, the inspection of telegrams and the conscription of military grain have caused unease in Northern society. The meeting was adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3>The National Government Stipulates Methods for Appealing Against Illegal Acts of Administrative Officials</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan is the Highest Decision-Making Body</p>
<p>The National Government yesterday issued a special order to all directly subordinate agencies, informing them that the Executive Yuan should be the highest decision-making body for appeals against illegal acts of administrative agencies. The order stated: "It is hereby ordered that the previous approval of the Central Political Council's reply regarding the issue of which agency to file administrative lawsuits against illegal acts of administrative agencies was handed over to Committee Member Wang Chonghui for research. According to the reply, before the establishment of the Administrative Court, one may temporarily invoke the old Law on Appeals to file appeals. Please investigate and comply with the above. As for the central and local highest administrative agencies of the old Law on Appeals, which should be determined first, two proposed methods were submitted for approval by the Civil Service Office of the National Government: (1) The final decision on inappropriate dispositions under the old Law on Appeals shall be made by the Executive Yuan; (2) According to the old Law on Appeals, those who have declared dissatisfaction within the statutory period may still file a re-appeal with the superior administrative agency. The above methods have been submitted to the 64th State Council Meeting of the National Government for approval. In addition to distributing them separately, you are hereby ordered to acknowledge and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Ecuador Will Ban Imports</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Health Determined that it is a Narcotic Drug</p>
<p>Handled in Accordance with Item D of Article 14 of the Hague Convention</p>
<p>The Central Anti-Opium Committee previously received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the International League of Nations had stated in a letter that the Geneva Anti-Opium Convention's proposed recommendations considered five kinds of drugs, including Ecuador, as narcotic drugs, which have the same harmful effects as the drugs to which the convention applies. It was asked whether China intended to apply the provisions of Item D of Article 14 of the Hague Anti-Opium Convention to the above-mentioned drugs. The committee immediately submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for instructions on whether the five kinds of drugs should be subject to the provisions of Item D of Article 14 of the Hague Anti-Opium Convention, so as to prevent their import and eliminate abuses. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan transferred the matter to the Ministry of Health for verification. According to the reply, the five kinds of drugs, including Ecuador, are derivatives or preparations of opium components, which can all be used as substitutes for opium. If they are continued to be taken, they have the same harmful effects and impacts as opium and should naturally also be regarded as narcotic drugs. The provisions of Item D of Article 14 of the Hague Anti-Opium Convention should be applied to prohibit their import. It is heard that the Executive Yuan has transferred the order to the Anti-Opium Committee for investigation and handling.</p>

<h3>Garrison Troops in Western Hunan Encircle and Suppress Zhou Chaowu</h3>
<p>Now Pressing Towards Dayong County</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence on the 20th: He Long and Zhou Chaowu are both well-known bandit leaders in Western Hunan, who have ravaged the local area and committed heinous crimes. Last year, He Long seized Sangzhi, raised the red banner high, and massacred civilians. After being severely suppressed by the military corps, he led his bandit troops to flee to Hefeng in western Hubei. However, Zhou Chaowu still occupies Dayong, secretly colluding with He Long. The Hunan Anti-Banditry Command believes that if He and Zhou are not eliminated quickly, the people of Western Hunan will never have peace of mind. In addition to consulting with the military authorities of the three provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, and Hunan to jointly suppress He Long, the task of suppressing Zhou Chaowu has been entrusted to Dai Douyuan, the Anti-Banditry Commander of Western Hunan, who has personally gone to supervise the suppression. After receiving the order, Dai set off from Changde to Cili on the 9th of this month to supervise the military corps in a large-scale encirclement and suppression. According to reports, on the 16th, the bandit troops were heavily defeated in Yankou, Tankou, and Laoyakou in Dayong, with many killed and captured. The troops are now pressing towards Dayong County, pursuing and attacking, and have sent a telegram to the province reporting the situation. The telegram states: A. Zhou Chaowu sent his bandit party Zhou Dushu to lead 600-700 bandit troops to occupy Yankou; Zhang Yi led 700-800 bandit troops to occupy Tankou; Li Dewu led 600-700 bandit troops to occupy Laoyakou; and Li Ziyuan led 300-400 bandit troops to occupy Zhengjiaping, totaling over 2,000 people, blocking our troops along the way. B. I ordered the Tian Regiment to lead the Xing Independent Battalion to attack the bandit troops in Laoyakou from Jinyanshan; the Liu Regiment to attack the bandit troops in Tankou from Tankouping; and the main force, together with the Cili militia led by Wang Yuqi, to attack the bandit troops in Yankou from Jiashikou; and Xu Chuanshu to supervise the militia to attack the bandit troops in Zhengjiaping from Baizhangxia. All were ordered to act simultaneously at dawn today (the 16th) to clear out the bandit troops and press towards Dayong. C. According to reports from the Tian and Liu Regiments, who contacted us by telephone from Xikou, the attack situation is summarized as follows: (1) The Tian Regiment came into contact with the enemy troops in Laoyakou at 6:00 AM today. After about three hours of fierce fighting, the bandits launched a fierce assault on our troops. After our artillery and machine guns fired with full force, our officers and soldiers advanced bravely and launched a flanking attack on the right wing, and the bandits were defeated. The bandits in Tankou fled to Chenjiashan. By noon today, our troops had successively occupied the three passes and are now pressing towards Dayong City to pursue and attack. (2) A total of over 50 bandits were killed, over 100 were wounded, over 40 miscellaneous rifles, 3 pistols, and 1 submachine gun were seized. 15 of our soldiers were wounded and 4 were killed. (3) The Xu Chuanshu troops who went out of Baizhangxia did not report because they were on a flanking mission and were far from my position. D. In addition to ordering the front-line troops to continue to pursue and attack with all their might to eliminate the bandits, the situation of the attack on the three passes today is hereby reported for your review.</p>
<h3>Missing Airplane Found in Liling</h3>
<p>Two Pilots Found Dead Inside</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The First Air Squadron of the Aviation Department, which was transferred to Guangdong last December to participate in the campaign against Zhang Gui, returned to Wuhan from Guangdong after the Tang Department's rebellion. On December 20th, three planes took off from Guangdong. One plane braved the weather and arrived in Wuhan, one returned to Guangzhou, and one went missing in Hunan. Repeated telegrams were sent to the counties of southern Hunan to search for it, but to no avail. The Aviation Department offered a reward of 1,000 yuan to encourage people to report information. After more than a month, there was still no news. Unexpectedly, on the 24th of this month, the Fourth Route Headquarters suddenly received a report from Hong Hangxian, a code clerk of the 15th Division, stating that his home was in Youwu, Liling West First District. Yesterday, on his way back to the unit from home, he met his cousin Hong Caigui, who told him that Luo Yongnian, who lived in Huang Gou Lian Chao, a small place in Luojia Ridge, had seen a plane fall on the mountain while cutting firewood on the 22nd of this month. There were two dead people inside, as well as two Browning pistols. At the same time, Liling County also telegraphed that a crashed plane had been found in Yaochang Temple, Liling West Third District, with two decomposed bodies inside and two Browning pistols. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate, and further details will be reported later. After receiving the report, the Headquarters dispatched Kuang Shengtao, a member of the Transportation Department, to investigate, and also sent a letter to Zhou Xicheng, the head of the Changsha Machine Department, asking him to send Zhang Shitong, a staff member, to go to Luojia Ridge, Liling, with the informant Hong Hangxian to investigate. Kuang, Zhang, and Hong took the early train to Zhuping on the 25th. (25th)</p>
<h3>Financial Reorganization Measures in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>From the 19th, all Taxes in the Province Will Be Collected in Silver Dollars</p>
<p>The Central Bank Will Have a Capital of 80 Million in One Year</p>
<p>Tax Increase Allocated to Central Bank Permanent Fund</p>
<p>Additional Exchange Branches Opened to Exchange Various Paper Currencies</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, due to the war in Guangxi Province and the heavy military expenditures, the Central Bank's banknotes have been slightly affected. The unredeemed five-yuan, ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and one-hundred-yuan notes are worth about 76-77% of their face value on the market. The redeemed one-yuan notes, because the Central Bank has recently been redeeming them with old silver dollars, and the market discriminates against old dollars, have also been affected, and now only worth 92% of their face value in new silver dollars. Seeing this situation, the authorities took this opportunity to thoroughly reorganize the Central Bank's capital, seeking a permanent and solid foundation. Huang Jusu, the newly appointed member of the Provincial Government, proposed this at the Provincial Affairs Conference, which was approved and announced by the Finance Department for implementation. The fundamental method is to collect all taxes in the province in cash, and all government expenditures will be paid in banknotes. The cash received will be used to purchase banknotes from the Central Bank, which will increase the Central Bank's capital day by day, and the Central Bank will be able to resume unlimited redemption. As for supplementing the Central Bank's current capital, it is planned to borrow from Guangzhou's rentals for one month within this month, which will yield about one million yuan, and to collect grain taxes in advance, which will yield about</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>four million yuan, totaling five million yuan. Adding the revenue from the provincial treasury and the national treasury, more than ten million yuan can be obtained in the short term, and 80 million yuan can be obtained in one year. The Central Bank's capital has been permanently consolidated. In order to realize unlimited redemption, the Central Bank can set up five to ten additional exchange branches in the market within one month to facilitate the public's redemption of notes. After March 10th, new silver dollars can be redeemed. The government is willing to recoin the old coins, even if it loses 30,000 yuan for every million yuan. If the Central Bank's capital is sufficient, the five-yuan and one-hundred-yuan notes can also be restored to redemption in a few months. The financial reorganization measures announced by the Finance Department are listed below: (1) All taxes and levies collected by the Finance Department and the Special Envoy's Office are completely collected in silver dollars, and all cash will be allocated to the Central Bank's reserve fund and absolutely cannot be used for other purposes. In order to increase the reserve fund and fully restore redemption as soon as possible, all taxes and levies will still be collected with an additional 10% surcharge. (2) In addition to the above-mentioned tax revenues supplementing the Central Bank as a reserve fund, the Finance Department will formulate measures within three days to raise 5 million yuan in cash and transfer it to the Central Bank as a reserve fund. These measures will be submitted for decision and implementation at the next meeting. (3) In order to facilitate the people, the Central Bank should establish five to ten additional redemption offices in Guangzhou this month to facilitate the redemption of banknotes that have been announced to be restored to redemption. (4) In order to increase the public's confidence in Central Bank's notes, the Central Bank should hand over all the current old dollars and the old dollars gradually allocated from the Finance Department and the Special Envoy's Office to the Mint to be recoined into new dollars, and stipulate that from March 1st, both new and old dollars will be used for redemption in equal parts, and from March 10th, all new dollars will be used for redemption. (5) The Finance Department should assess the situation and announce the restoration of redemption of the five-yuan, ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and one-hundred-yuan banknotes in the shortest possible time, separately and successively. (6) All expenditures of the Party, government, and military agencies of the Finance Department and the Special Envoy's Office will be paid in banknotes that have been restored to redemption. (7) The Finance Department shall order the county governments to collect all revenues in silver dollars and pay all expenditures in banknotes that have been restored to redemption, so that the banknotes issued by the Central Bank can circulate throughout the province. The implementation of these measures in each county will be determined by the Finance Department in an order. (8) Before each county government implements the measure of paying all expenditures in banknotes, the Central Bank should send personnel to the locations of the county governments to establish Central Bank redemption offices to facilitate the people's redemption. (9) After all Central Bank's banknotes have been fully restored to redemption, the Finance Department and the Special Envoy's Office should assess the situation and announce that all taxes and levies will still be collected in Central Bank's banknotes. It is reported that all national and provincial taxes in Guangdong Province will be collected in silver dollars from the 19th of this month in Guangzhou and from the date of receipt of the telegram in each county, and will still be collected with an additional 10% surcharge. However, the salt tax, tobacco tax, defense tax, Yihui money, land tax deed tax, and all Shatian income in Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou will still be collected in full silver dollars, without the 10% surcharge.

In addition, for fundraising, 20% of the administrative expenses of various agencies will be paid in military expenditure coupons from February, and political expenses will also be delayed. For example, the salary for the first half of January will be paid in February, and the salary for the second half of January will be paid in March, and so on. Regarding the grain taxes of each county, it is stipulated that the grain tax for the 19th year must be prepaid from March 1st, and the overdue grain taxes for the 17th and 18th years must be paid in full before February 30th to fund the military.

<h3>Tang Dynasty Princess's Tomb in Xinyang Excavated</h3>
<p>Five miles south of Liulin Town, Southern District of Xinyang, Henan Province, there is a Longzhu Spring Temple, an ancient temple from the Tang Dynasty. Next to the temple is a tomb from the Tang Dynasty. According to legend, during the flourishing period of Buddhism in the Tang Dynasty, a certain princess went to worship in the South China Sea, escorted by Yuchi Gong. She died of illness on the way and was buried there. Many treasures were buried with her. In front of the tomb, there is a green stone tablet with an inscription by Chu Suiliang on Yuchi Gong's construction and repair, and the handwriting is still discernible. (It is said that the tablet has now been hidden.) There are also stone tables and stone incense burners, and the old site of the stone walls is still there, which is quite imposing and is one of the ancient sites of Xinyang County.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Nie Daozun, the chairman of the Liulin Chamber of Commerce, Wei Hanqing, the village head of Liulin Village, Zheng Bingqing, the head of the People's Self-Defense Team, and Tu Baiqing, the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, acting on orders from an unknown organization, suddenly went to excavate the tomb on November 27th of last year. The excavated treasures were not made public. According to news from the monks of Longquan Temple and the members of the Chamber of Commerce, there were various antiques, including gold Buddhas, gold tripods, gold stoves, gold chopsticks, gold bowls, pearl-shining bowls, treasure bottles, and cranes. There were also small porcelain temples and figures, as well as items that were black with green rust, the names of which were unknown.</p>
<p>The tomb was built with stone strips into a circular vault, about 14 to 15 feet deep, about 8 feet wide, and about 7 feet high. There were square urns in the walls, like windows, about 1 foot square. There was an urn hole in the back wall, about 2 feet square and about 1 foot deep, with a pottery temple inside. Outside the tomb door, on the left and right, there were stone windows of 5 feet square each. The left window has been excavated and destroyed, and the right window has not yet been excavated. The project is huge and extremely sturdy.</p>
<p>According to general opinion, the Princess's tomb is one of the ancient sites of Xinyang and has been carefully protected throughout the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. It has preservation value in terms of ancient sites. Now, it has suddenly been excavated, which is a great pity.</p>
<h3>Former Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Arrives in Harbin</h3>
<p>The Protagonist of the Sino-Russian Case</p>
<p>Actually Serves as Deputy Director</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence on the 21st: Ye Musanoff, the central figure in the Sino-Russian dispute, who was dismissed and expelled from the Chinese Eastern Railway by the former authorities of the Chinese Eastern Railway on July 10th of last year, arrived in Harbin on the evening of the 19th, according to a telephone call from Suifenhe, saying that Ye Musanoff had come from Russia and passed through the station to Harbin. He was accompanied by Ye's family members and the Russian Jie Yixieer. Ye and others arrived in Harbin at 2:30 PM on the 20th. The Special Police Department specially dispatched a part of the armed security team to stand guard outside the station to maintain order, and the first section of the road police also worked overtime to guard the platform. Those who came to greet him included important figures from the Railway Bureau and the Soviet Union in Harbin, such as Director Rudeyi, Deputy Director Jiannisoff, Directors Danilievsky and Shenmanovsky, and various section chiefs, along with about four to five hundred other expatriates. On our side, Directors Li Shaogeng, Guo Fumin, and Shen Ruilin, Supervisor Liu Zerong, Chinese Deputy Director Guo Chongxi, Counselor Jin Ronggui of the Supervision Office, and Chinese section chiefs, totaling about thirty people, also came. After the train stopped, the welcoming Russians shouted "Long live!" Many of our authorities also勉强expressed their so-called welcome with smiles. Izmaylov, who came to greet him, got off first, followed by Ye, who took off his hat to thank the welcoming crowd and strode into the VIP room. After a short rest, he took a car to the Russian Consulate. In the evening at 7:00 PM, senior Russian officials of the Railway Bureau held a banquet at the Railway Club to welcome Ye. At about 1:00 PM on the 21st, Ye took a car to the Board of Directors, where all the directors greeted him. He was led into Izmaylov's office, and then a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors was convened. The chairman was acting Director Guo Fumin. In addition to the Russian directors, the Chinese directors present were Li Shaogeng, Supervisor Liu Zerong, and Supervisor Zhang Shu. Izmaylov then produced a letter from the Soviet Russian Transportation Committee appointing Ye Musanoff as the Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and asked the Chinese side to agree. It was immediately passed, and Ye Musanoff was invited into the conference hall. When Ye entered, everyone raised their glasses to congratulate him. After a short discussion, he resigned and went to the Railway Bureau to summon the section chiefs of the Railway Bureau. Director Rudeyi introduced him, and the section chiefs all congratulated Ye. After Ye met with the staff at the Railway Bureau, he bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>After Ye Musanoff changed his title to Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and came to Harbin to take office, the current members of the Board of Directors in Harbin include Li Shaogeng, Guo Fumin, Fan Qiguang, and Shen Ruilin from the Chinese side, and Ye Musanoff, Izmaylov, Shenmanovsky, and Dalilievsky from the Russian side, which is sufficient for the legal quorum. All the matters of the Chinese Eastern Railway itself are extremely complicated. The return of Director Mo Dehui to Harbin in the near future will allow for a discussion on whether the Chinese and Russian sides can work together happily, which will be decided at this meeting.</p>
<h3>Zhang and Jin Talk About Disturbances in Jiangxi; Zhu and Mao Will Be Cleared Soon</h3>
<p>Since the Communist bandits Zhu De and Mao Zedong have been causing disturbances in the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, the people have been displaced and suffered unspeakable pain. Recently, they have been severely wounded after repeated suppression by government troops. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daily News specifically visited Zhang Huizhan and Jin Handing, the division commanders in charge of suppressing the bandits, to inquire about the recent situation of the bandits. They were kind enough to answer as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Huizhan said that since He and Ye's rebellion, the Communist bandits have spread in Jiangxi. Since I was ordered to lead troops to garrison in Jiangxi, I have supervised my troops and fought hard to suppress them in order to eliminate the people's suffering. In the past six months, large groups of Communist bandits have been gradually defeated, and the lost territories have been recovered. Just as we were clearing them up, Zhu and Mao took advantage of our weak forces and led the bandits to disturb eastern Jiangxi again, capturing Guangchang and occupying Ningdu as their base. After the Central Government dispatched the Tang Brigade to Jiangxi, together with the Zhu and Dai Brigades, they attacked and captured the bandit nests in the past few days, and the bandit troops have fled, so there is no need to worry about a threat in the heart. After investigating, Zhu and Mao's strength is only about 4,000 people. Wherever they go, the houses are destroyed, and the people hate them to the bone. The bandits are still wearing single clothes, and the soldiers are only given six yuan a month, including food. They lack bullets, and the bandits all deeply regret their actions and often flee. If a complete plan is decided upon and a large army is used to encircle and suppress them, their roots can be eradicated in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Jin Handing said that since I led my troops to garrison at the border between Fujian and Jiangxi to block and suppress Zhu and Mao, they have been greatly damaged by our army's repeated encirclement and suppression. According to my investigation in Fujian, Mao Zedong did die of illness in Longyan. Only Zhu De is left. I have followed the Central Government's order to assign a brigade to be commanded by Chairman Lu. However, the Communist bandits often avoid the strong and attack the weak. I believe that as long as the Central Government allocates the troops properly, the main focus of bandit suppression should not be on recovering lost territories but on eliminating the bandits' strength. They should be fought at any time and wiped out. The most difficult thing about bandit suppression is that when lost territories are recovered, the people are afraid of the bandits and flee together, and there is no way to raise supplies. This time, I came to Beijing not only to pay my respects to Chairman Chiang and report on the garrison situation but also to discuss thoroughly with Division Commander Zhang Huizhan and formulate a complete plan to eliminate the Zhu bandits in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Japan Strives to Invest in the South Seas</h3>
<p>Intends to Seize Commercial Rights from Overseas Chinese and Replace Them</p>
<p>Japan's ambition for commercial rights in the South Seas is not a recent development. Since the implementation of the gold standard, its financial situation has greatly improved, increasing the possibility of foreign investment to a significant degree. As a result, major financial groups are vying to establish foreign investment plans. The most noteworthy of these is the activity of the Oriental Development Company. This company, with its quasi-official nature, has a remarkable history in Japanese colonization. Having already acquired 7/30 of the land in the Korean Peninsula and invested tens of millions of yuan in Manchuria, it has in recent years adopted a southward advance policy, striving to develop its influence in the South Seas. With the recent implementation of the gold standard, it is now implementing two plans: "South Seas Investment" and "Subsidizing South Seas Cultivation." These plans were originally formulated by the current Minister of Finance, Masaji Inoue. Inoue is a man of great vision and foresight. During his time out of office, he visited various ports in the South Seas for on-the-spot investigations. Upon returning to Japan, he submitted these plans to the Oriental Development Company, urging them to implement them as soon as possible. However, due to various obstacles, the plans were never carried out. Now that the gold standard issue has been resolved, and the original planner is in a prominent position, the talk of South Seas investment is finally becoming a reality. In recent years, the commerce of overseas Chinese in the South Seas has gradually declined due to various factors. The impact of Japanese southward expansion is a significant reason for this decline. If we do not strive to resist it, the commercial rights that our overseas Chinese compatriots have held in the South Seas for hundreds of years will inevitably be lost completely. The following is a summary of Inoue's plans for "South Seas Investment" and "Subsidizing South Seas Cultivation" for the reference of those concerned about South Seas commerce.</p>
<p>(1) It is planned to establish a branch of the company in Singapore in the first half of next year, and also set up branches in major areas of the South Seas.</p>
<p>(2) The objects of investment are cultivation businesses such as rubber and tea. The purpose is to provide financing to assist Japanese enterprises.</p>
<p>(3) From next year, the investment will be set at 50 million yuan over ten years. 20 million yuan is currently prepared for investment.</p>
<p>(4) The total amount of Japanese investment in various parts of the South Seas is currently 70 million yuan. The funds provided by the Chinese Merchants Bank and the Bank of Taiwan amount to 8 million yuan. The Oriental Development Company plans to lend at low interest rates.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Express News</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Mayor of Ningbo, Yang Ziyi, who was originally the Secretary-General of the Department of Civil Affairs, departed for Shanghai yesterday to transfer to Ningbo to assume his new post. The position of Secretary-General of the Department is being temporarily filled by Secretary Feng Xueyi. The duties of the Department Head are also temporarily being carried out by Feng.</p>
<p>The Head of the Department of Construction, Cheng Zhenjun, is going abroad for inspection and is scheduled to depart on the 7th of next month.

<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Rice Price Review Committee held its 49th regular meeting yesterday. It was decided that the retail price of rice, from top quality to starting price and rice for the common people, would remain unchanged. However, the price of steamed rice has risen excessively. From the 28th, the price will be increased by 40 cents per stone (i.e., 16 yuan per stone). The price of Du Nuo glutinous rice and Yin Nuo glutinous rice will each be reduced by 40 cents per stone. The Department of Civil Affairs, based on a complaint filed by the Ninghai natives association in Hangzhou regarding the director of the Haimen inspection station, Su Zhitan, detaining rice without reason, dispatched personnel to investigate yesterday.</p>

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>A Large Gang of Lake Bandits Gathered on the Shores of Cheng Lake, Not Far from Wucheng Tan Village, in the Bacheng District of Kunshan County</p>
<p>Yang Santai Temple, located three li away from the village on the lake surface, has a strategically important position. It's surrounded by the lake on three sides (the northeastern part of Yangcheng Lake), and the rear is a labyrinth of branching ports. The grass and forests form a rather dangerous terrain. The area currently belongs to Xiangcheng District of Wu County, connecting with Bacheng District of Kunshan County. An examination of the structure of Yang Santai Temple reveals it to be a five-bay, three-courtyard structure. The middle part has been covered in mud and dust, rarely visited by people, with only an old man guarding it. Therefore, robbers and thieves frequent the place from time to time. Recently, a large group of lake bandits arrived there, occupying the temple and holding several hostages on boats. It is said that the bandits have powerful firearms and appear and disappear unpredictably. They often post sentries at night, as far as ten li away, with flashing electric torches. The villagers are afraid to go out. The leader's surname is Wang, and the general firearms depot is in Yangcheng Village, in the Dianjing District of Wu County. (This place is also a hiding place for bandits in Yangcheng Lake.) It is said that the bandits have made elaborate arrangements, stationing five or six bandit boats at each strategically important port to prepare for any eventuality. However, the boats are quite diverse, including small fishing boats, farm boats, and speedboats. The food supply is transported by two dedicated boats, so there is no shortage of supplies. Large quantities of fish, meat, vegetables, tobacco, alcohol, oil, and firewood are purchased from Xiaojing Town in Xiangcheng District of Wu County. In recent days, Weijing Tang and Wu Jing in Wu County have been looted. It is also heard that the bandits have joined forces in Yangcheng Lake. Rumors are spreading that the bandits are planning to attack Xiangcheng, Dongtang, and Bacheng. Therefore, the head of the Ninth District of Kunshan County, Bacheng District, has requested and obtained eighty or ninety public security officers from the county government to patrol the countryside day and night.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Carpenters and Bricklayers Gather to Discuss Price Increases</p>
<p>Local carpenters and bricklayers, due to the rising cost of living, have found that the originally agreed wages are insufficient. They gathered at the Luban Temple business association on the 23rd. As a result, they resolved to increase the price by six cents per worker, making it sixty cents per worker, effective from the beginning of June.</p>
<p>Dispute over Towel Tax Collection</p>
<p>The towel tax in this county has been contracted to Mao Yongji of the same industry, with a monthly amount of 120 yuan. Last year, Wu Gongyuan, Ma Zhengchang, Lu Yongyuan, Liu Zuting, and others contracted the tax in the name of the Towel Industry Merchants Association, increasing the amount to 180 yuan. They levied the tax on each loom operator at 1.2 yuan per load. Later, after members of the industry discovered fraudulent activities, they filed a complaint with the county party headquarters for investigation. This year, the tax collection was contracted to a newly formed Towel Industry Branch of the Merchants Association, which charges 80 cents per load. Wu Gongshun, Ma Zhengchang, Liu Zuting, and others, who originally handled the tax collection, were unwilling to accept this and, using the name of the old Towel Industry Merchants Association, secretly contracted the tax to the Chenjiadu sub-bureau and obtained tax forms from the Finance Department, which they distributed to the various members of the industry. At the beginning of the month, the first two shifts of boats transporting goods to Shanghai were allowed to pass. This was discovered by Chen Yisan, the executive director of the Towel Branch, who contacted the Shanghai Special Cotton Tax Bureau and obtained permission to cancel Wu Gongshun's contract. Recently, Daquanren, Wu Gongshun, Yichangyong, and others transported more than forty pieces of towels on Xu Shousheng's boat but did not report the tax. Chen Yisan of the Towel Branch requested the Nanxiang water police to detain the boat. The county chamber of commerce mediated, but no satisfactory agreement was reached. Daquanren and others believed that they were reporting the tax with a receipt and were not violating the law. The Towel Branch believed that since they had contracted the tax, they had the absolute right to dispose of it. The matter is currently at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Resolution of Labor-Management Dispute at Cloth Factory</p>
<p>The weaving industry in this city has recently developed gradually. Major players in this industry, such as Xilin Cloth Factory and Guanghua Cloth Factory, experienced difficulties due to sluggish sales last year and repeated labor disputes. The factory owners all felt difficulties. They once announced a temporary shutdown in November of last year. Later, at the request of the workers' union, the county government mediated, and the factory owners reluctantly agreed to resume operations. By the end of last year, both Xilin and Guanghua factories reported losses. The Guanghua shareholders did not want to continue operating. After the accountant proved that the losses were real, they petitioned the county government to decide to close the factory. However, the workers claimed that the factories were destroying the labor movement and made several demands that the factory owners could not accept. Finally, the county government and the labor union mediated repeatedly and persuaded the workers. After several consultations, Xilin Cloth Factory agreed to pay each worker 15 yuan in severance pay, and Guanghua Factory agreed to pay each worker 16 yuan, with female workers receiving 3 to 4 yuan each. The factories submitted a list of workers to the county government for distribution and receipt. The workers have now left Songjiang to seek other employment.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Refugees Suddenly Arrived at Jiuli Pavilion</p>
<p>Today (the 27th), over a thousand refugees from Jiangbei arrived at Jiuli Pavilion, a place in the northern suburbs of this city, bringing the old and supporting the young and begging for food. The residents there, fearing that this would cause trouble, reported to the public security bureau through the village head and local guarantor, requesting that police be dispatched to suppress the situation. After receiving the report, the public security bureau forwarded it to the county government, which immediately dispatched a platoon of county police, armed with live ammunition, to suppress the situation to prevent any incidents. They also advised them to leave the area. In order to prepare for the establishment of a county court and for the Higher Court to plan for the rapid establishment of county courts throughout the county, a plan was proposed to submit to the provincial government for the allocation of funds. After determining the plan for the phased establishment, the Songjiang County Court was listed as the first to be established. The other day, Court President Lin sent Secretary Yao Guozhang to Songjiang to meet with County Magistrate Jin and Trial Officer Du to discuss everything. The court site is still determined to be the address of the Public Security Bureau, which is currently stationed there and needs to find another place to move to in order to prepare at their leisure. It is heard that the establishment of the county court is scheduled for the first half of this year.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Famous Pirate Arrested in Nantong</p>
<p>The famous pirate Li Wanbao (also known as Li Xiaosizi) used to harass ships traveling on the Yangtze River under Sang Haishan's command. After Sang was executed, Li was arrested and interrogated by the Changshu County Public Security Bureau in November of last year and was soon released. After Li escaped from prison, he joined a gang and robbed in the Nantong area. Last month, Chen Dalang's sailing boat from Hupu, loaded with cloth, was robbed by Li's gang on its way to Jiangbei. Afterwards, the Nantong police team investigated and arrested Li Wanbao the other day. The police officers broke Li's leg bone. He has now been sent to the Nantong County for handling.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Armed Refugees Arrived in Wujiang</p>
<p>Three towns in Wujiang County, Pingwang, Beita, and Lili, received more than 3,000 refugees from Jiangbei on the 26th, traveling on more than 200 boats. The boats were loaded with coffins, which contained either corpses or firearms. The people in these towns are extremely alarmed. They telegraphed the Third District of the Water and Land Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting them to send a team to suppress the situation. After approving the telegram, District Chief Gong immediately ordered the guerrilla team to go there and ordered Teams 15 and 14 to go to suppress the situation.</p>
<p>Li Genyuan and Cheng Peiyi Cross-Lawsuit Case</p>
<p>The case of the former Prime Minister Li Genyuan and his concubine Cheng Peiyi suing each other was heard for the second time in the District Court yesterday (the 27th). The plaintiff, Li Genyuan, Li Ma's, and Monk Shi Ru, did not appear in court and were represented by lawyer Tang Shenfang. The defendants, Cheng Peiyi and Cheng Peiyu, both appeared in court. Cheng Peiyi was questioned about her experience leaving home and living at Cheng Peiyu's home. Cheng Peiyu was also questioned whether Peiyi was instigated by someone. Peiyu testified that Peiyi is Li Genyuan's wife and that she needs to request alimony because Li is not providing it. The court also stated that the plaintiff intends to withdraw the lawsuit. The defendant immediately stated that they do not want to withdraw the counterclaim.</p>
<p>News of Water and Land Police Teams Suppressing Bandits</p>
<p>Bandits Hiding in Yangcheng Lake, Water and Land Police Set Out to Pursue and Suppress Them</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 27th), the Third District of the Water and Land Public Security Bureau continued to report that the bandits were a merger of two gangs from Haizhou and Pudong, totaling about 200 people. They had fled from Dianshan Lake to Damao Port, Xigang, and other places. The escort warships Zhenwei and the 11th water police team have arrived in Pingwang to track down and suppress them with the 14th and 15th teams.</p>
<p>Wujiang Came to Suzhou to Search for Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The Wujiang County Public Security Bureau received a letter from someone named Guo Zhengxiang, accusing Zhang Shouchang, an Anhui native living at No. 321 Xiatang, Dongzhong City, Suzhou, of colluding with lake bandits and robbing the towns of Luxu and Wuqing. Afterwards, he received 514 yuan in stolen goods and buried two box cannons and two pistols at home. Director Xue personally came to Suzhou and, together with the Northern District Police Department, arrested Zhang at his address and searched the house thoroughly. As a result, no firearms were found. Zhang also did not admit to colluding with the bandits. After examining the postal letter, it was found to be sent from Shanghai Shiyuli, and the postmark was from Suzhou. Therefore, Zhang was released on bail.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Hidden Worries about the Future of the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring in this county, the price of rice has risen sharply. The price of high-quality white rice has risen to 15.2 yuan per stone. The reason for the high price of rice is due to unscrupulous merchants transporting it for export. It was recently heard that several rice shops transported a total of 760 stones of rice to Nantong and Chongming in a few days. There are also many others that are not known to the public. Moreover, the sources of rice and wheat are also very scarce everywhere. An investigation in this county reveals that there are only over 100,000 stones of rice left. Even if this is used to supply the people in the county, it will only last until around April 15. If it continues to be transported for export, this county will be in danger of starvation. Yesterday, it was heard that County Magistrate Sun plans to convene a meeting of rice industry leaders in the next few days to discuss and strictly prohibit exports to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing for the Exhibition of Products from Eight Counties and Cities</p>
<p>In order to promote local products and encourage industry and commerce, County Magistrate Sun Zuji of this county has initiated a joint exhibition of local products from eight counties and cities: Wuxian, Suzhou, Wujin, Yixing, Jiangyin, Changshu, and Liyang. It is stipulated that the first exhibition will be held in Huishan, this county, scheduled to open in mid-April. The other counties and cities will hold meetings in sequence. It is learned that County Magistrate Sun is currently working with the Municipal Preparatory Office to actively prepare. A draft of the regulations has already been formulated and will be submitted to the provincial government and the relevant authorities for record after being passed by a joint meeting of the eight counties and cities. The other day, when Civil Affairs Commissioner Miao inspected the local autonomy and returned to Wuxi, County Magistrate Sun reported the proposed plan to the Commissioner in person. Miao expressed his strong approval. County Magistrate Sun has scheduled to convene a meeting of the County Magistrates and Mayors and Chamber of Commerce Presidents of the eight counties and cities at the Municipal Preparatory Office in this county at 2:00 PM on February 4 to discuss various regulations and plans. Yesterday, special letters were sent to the seven other County Magistrates and Mayors, requesting them to come to Wuxi to attend the meeting on time to help with this grand event.</p>
<p>Robbery Cases in the Counties of Ji and Yi</p>
<p>The Wuxi Brothers Hospital received patients from Wujin and Yixing Counties yesterday who had gunshot wounds inflicted by robbers. The details are as follows: (1) At Huadu Bridge in Wujin, 36 li from the city, more than ten bandits arrived at Xie Hengchang's grocery store in the town after 10:00 PM, robbing them of more than 500 yuan. When Gu Caiqing's mother, from the Zhenchang cocoon shop on the same street, opened the door to look out, she was robbed of a gold ring and gold earrings. Wang Baosheng, who was selling ship tickets at Gu's house, was shot in the scrotum. He came to Wuxi yesterday for treatment at the Brothers Hospital. (2) In Fufengqiao Township, Yixing County, there are more than 30 stores. Three bandits, all armed with pistols, arrived at Qi Tongxing's grocery store on the east side of the street the other night and proceeded to rob them. All the stores closed their doors upon hearing the alarm. Yang Shengrong, an apprentice at Hu Dexing's noodle shop on the west side of the street, was shot in the back by the bandits. The bullet did not exit. He also came to Wuxi yesterday for treatment at the Brothers Hospital. Although the injury is serious, it is not life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Please Investigate the Robbery Case in Fu Guo</p>
<p>Xiqiao in Wuyi is a bustling market attached to the city. On the evening of the 25th, three bandits suddenly appeared, all armed with pistols, and robbed the Zhen Tai and Da Tong rice shops one after another, ordering the shop assistants to hand over the keys and robbing them of silver dollars. Afterwards, they fled to Yanjia Village in Cangnong. The town chiefs of Sanbao and Puji Towns, Tang Mengxi and Huang Chuancheng, reported the case to the district office and requested the county to strictly investigate and punish the robbers and recover the stolen goods, because the bandits robbed the bustling market when it was not late at night.</p>
<p>Physicians Association Convenes Meeting</p>
<p>The Wuyi Physicians Association convened a meeting yesterday. All members attended.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Daytime Robbery Case at Jintong Bridge East of the City (Shuangpai Taiping Town)</p>
<p>Five bandits, Lu Zhanglin, Wang Zigen, Qin Qirong, and others, suddenly came to Jin Hengsheng's cloth store at around 4:00 PM on the 25th, armed with box cannons. They grabbed Jin Wengang, a shop assistant, and said they were borrowing 500 yuan, which they limited to three days to pay, and showed a letter with incomprehensible sentences. This was learned by the San Guan Public Security Second Branch. Inspector Fan Yu led the police, Cheng Lai, and engaged in a battle with the five bandits. A letter was lost from Inspector Fan's hat, and the bandits fled. The cloth store suffered losses. Afterwards, the Central Bureau in the city also dispatched two squads of police to round up the area. They returned to the city at 11:00 PM. They encountered Xu Zushun from Guanzhuang on the road. Because his actions were suspicious, they brought him to the city for interrogation.</p>
<p>Case of Suspected Reactionary Activity Reported to the Province for Instructions</p>
<p>County Magistrate Shen, in accordance with the order from the Commander-in-Chief's Department and the Department of Civil Affairs, detained six suspects in the Communist case from Changjing: Wang Tongfu, Bao Hansheng, Wang Yanbin, Gu Di, Zhang Lianfang, and Zhou Keming from Gushan. Except for Wang Tongfu and Tong Keming, who went to Suzhou and were not captured, Bao Hansheng and the other four, along with the plaintiff Xu Ruiwen, were brought to the city for questioning by Chief Inspector Cai Sheping of the Public Security Bureau on the 25th. Their confessions have not been made public yet. They were ordered to be temporarily detained pending instructions from the province. District Chief Chen Jingchen of the Seventh District and others jointly vouched for them to the county, allowing them to be summoned at any time.</p>
<p>Measures to Relieve Rice Shortage by Donating to Run a Flat Rice Shop</p>
<p>Since the spring, rice prices have soared, and the common people have been complaining endlessly. There is no Ke Xian rice arriving at the port. District Chief Wei Buchan of the First District recently submitted a plan to the county to issue tax-exempt passports, raise funds to purchase rice, and sell it at a fair price. The county government immediately forwarded it to the Department of Civil Affairs for review. During the district chief meeting on the 25th, District Chief Qian Junchu of the Fourteenth District proposed to use accumulated grain to run a flat rice shop to relieve the people's food shortage. This was also approved.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Food Regulation Committee Relieves Rice Famine</p>
<p>Zhang Shouyong, Lu Xiaobo, and other members of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Regulation Committee, based on the motion, had previously ordered 30,000 stones of rice from Saigon to relieve the rice famine. They have paid 50,000 yuan in cash to a foreign firm in Shanghai and are expected to arrive in the province soon. However, the method of distribution is quite difficult. If distributed to 61 counties, each county will receive very little, which can only relieve the temporary situation. It is also heard that the price of this rice was only 12 yuan when it was purchased last year, but now it has risen to about 15 yuan, resulting in a considerable loss.</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Orders Private Purchase of Firearms</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs believes that in recent years, banditry has been rampant in various parts of Jiangsu Province. It has been suppressed repeatedly but continues to rise. Various counties are mostly purchasing firearms for self-defense as a precaution. However, firearms are a major concern, and carelessness in handling them can lead to abuses. Previous regulations on the purchase of firearms have been issued to the counties for compliance. However, recently some counties have purchased firearms without prior approval, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the previous order was reiterated yesterday. In the future, any purchase of firearms should be based on the county's consideration of the situation, with a list of types and quantities, submitted to the department for approval in advance before preparing the funds and reporting to the department for handling on their behalf.</p>
<p>Fourth Sub-Bureau Rescues Kidnapped Victims</p>
<p>The wife Huang of Xiang Liping, a civilian in Xuecun, Shangdang, in the southern part of Zhenjiang, and his son and daughter were kidnapped by bandit Li Er last year and were extorted for a large sum of money. Xiang was unable to redeem them, resulting in the case remaining unresolved. The Fourth Sub-Bureau of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has learned that the kidnapped victims are being held in the Da Jiao Chang area. The other day, Sub-Bureau Chief Su Han of the Su Han Sub-Bureau, together with Inspector Hu of the Second Sub-Station, went to the area and arrested the kidnapper Li Er on the spot. The kidnapped victims Huang and her three children were rescued and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Distribution of Self-Government Donations</p>
<p>The county government believes that the funding for self-government districts varies, resulting in clear differences in the achievements of each district. In addition to the county government's approved request to the provincial government to allocate 2,000 yuan per month from the self-government house tax in Zhenyi, yesterday it also issued an order to each district that all miscellaneous taxes and property rents should be distributed equally by the Funds and Property Office in the future.</p>
<p>Puji Ferry Delayed Indefinitely</p>
<p>The Puji ferry from Zhenjiang to Guazhou Shierxu was originally built with public donations and is entirely charitable in nature. However, due to poor management, although the ferry tickets are sold at the listed price, the revenue and expenditure still cannot be offset. The ferry has been suspended for nearly a month and has not yet resumed operations. Travelers from Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, and Yizheng Counties are extremely inconvenienced. It is said that the reason for this is that the distribution of duties by one or two officials has not been determined, causing this charitable ferry to be suspended for a long time. There is now talk of holding a committee meeting on March 1, but it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Request for Assistance in Collecting Rice Tax Outside the South Gate</p>
<p>The members of the Rice Tax Collection Committee in this county, Ye Yuqing, etc., believe that due to the famine in the northwest countryside in the eighteenth year, 80-90% of the rice shops in Situ Temple, Fenghuang Qiaoqiao, and other places have successively closed down, resulting in a sharp decline in tax revenue.

<h3>Letter from the Ministry of Interior</h3>
<p>Recently, I read in your newspaper's "Important News" section that the Ministry of Interior is drafting regulations on wedding and funeral rites. This does not entirely align with the facts. The Ministry's Department of Rites and Customs submitted a request last November to organize a rites and customs drafting committee, and various committee members were appointed to carry out the work. Several drafts have been prepared, but they are still under review and have not been passed by the general assembly. The statement that they have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review is not factual. This letter is to clarify and request a correction. Ministry of Interior, February 25th.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Explains Regulations on Academic Organizations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau regarding various academic organizations affiliated with national, provincial, municipal, and private schools at all levels, or various academic organizations organized by teachers and students of these schools that use the school's name but are privately run in nature, and which were originally approved by the schools or higher-level education authorities or are supervised and guided by the schools, seeks clarification on whether such quasi-public and quasi-private academic organizations should be managed by local education administrative agencies. The Ministry instructed the bureau, stating that if various academic organizations established by public and private schools use the school's name and their membership is limited to teachers and students of the school, they may be managed by the school itself. However, other academic organizations affiliated with the schools that allow external members should be managed in accordance with the regulations of the education administrative agency for academic organizations. The order is issued to the bureau for compliance and dissemination. [P Ministry of Education's Letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs &gt;</p>
<p>Regarding the International Conference on Applied Science</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Specifies Procedures for Implementing Secondary Education</h3>

[P Zhejiang Education Department Submits a Request to the Ministry of Education to Promulgate Regulations on Educational Professionalization &gt;</p>
<p>and Protection Regulations for Elementary Education Personnel</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department submitted a document to the Ministry of Education yesterday, stating that the Third Zhejiang Provincial Third School District Education Administrative Personnel Joint Conference reported that the cultivation of talent, mining, medicine, and education are distinct fields. Originally, the purpose was to cultivate specialized talent for the development of various industries. However, in recent years, it has become common for those who study medicine to engage in commerce, and those who study agriculture to engage in law. This is especially prevalent in the education sector, to the extent that those who fail to succeed in other fields use the education sector as a haven, and those who lose their jobs use the education sector as a refuge. The education sector is seen as unimportant and accessible to everyone, which is unfortunate for the education sector. Therefore, for the sake of developing and emphasizing education, it is recommended to request the Ministry of Education to promulgate regulations on educational professionalization and protection regulations for elementary education personnel for compliance. According to this, it is common for elementary education personnel to leave their posts during their term of office or for other reasons, and it is true that unemployed people use education as a refuge. The promulgation of regulations on educational professionalization and protection regulations for elementary education personnel seems to be urgently needed today. The report presents the above situation and requests review and implementation.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Inspectors Depart for Inspection</h3>
<p>And Sends Specialists to Inspect Vocational and Normal Education</p>
<p>Chen, the Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, believes that since elementary schools in the province have already started, it is imperative to dispatch inspectors for inspection to seek improvement. It was decided to dispatch eight inspectors, with one remaining in the department for office work. The rest were scheduled to depart on March 14th to inspect forty counties divided into five routes, excluding those already inspected in the previous session. Shen Qi will lead the first route, covering ten counties including Fuyang. Feng Keshu will lead the second route, covering eight counties including Mayen. Chen Zhang will lead the third route, covering seven counties including Xinchang. Zhang Rentian will lead the fourth route, covering eight counties including Tonglu. Lu Guqing will lead the fifth route, covering seven counties including Xuanping. Director Chen also believes that the province lacks resources and vocational education lacks a foundation. To investigate the truth and seek improvement, Zhu Wenzhi was appointed to inspect the normal education department or normal training classes and affiliated elementary schools of provincial secondary schools, as well as county and city private normal training institutions. Qian Jiazhi was appointed to inspect various vocational schools and revisit the provincial, county, and city private secondary schools already inspected in the previous session. Zhang Xingjian will remain in the department for office work.</p>

Moreover, the matter is unprecedented and is related to the observation of various countries around the world. Overseas Chinese are studying sports and are renowned around the world, and there are many people who should be solicited to participate to avoid regrets. However, in the past, the addresses of sports organizations in various ports were unknown, making it difficult to reach them one by one. Only announcements were published in major domestic newspapers. Now, the Chinese Sports Association has found the addresses and sent telegrams and detailed letters in advance, enclosing important announcements and rules, soliciting participation. Overseas compatriots have always been enthusiastic about their motherland and will surely participate actively to revitalize the spirit of the nation and glorify the Party and the country, gather compatriots in Yingyuan, and show the world.

<h3>Xinzi Group Wins Newspaper Workers' Football Championship</h3>
<p>Two Goals to Zero Victory Over the Current Affairs Group</p>
<p>The Newspaper Workers' Football Championship competition results have been recorded in this newspaper several times. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Xinzi Group played against the Shizi Group. Both teams' athletes bravely and willingly exerted themselves for a long time, neither yielding to the other. Later, the Xinzi Group's center forward took advantage of a gap and attacked, the goalkeeper pounced and hit the ball right onto the body of the right forward, who then put it into the net. The Xinzi Group opened the scoring first. Later, the Shizi Group's left inside forward received a ball and, judging the ball's momentum accurately, headed it, but it landed in front of the Xinzi Group's goal and was saved by the inside back. In the first half, the Xinzi Group took the lead with a score of 1 to 0. Afterwards, the Shizi Group counterattacked with all its strength, the center forward received the ball and shot at the goal, but all shots missed. Despite repeated attempts to retaliate, they were unsuccessful. The Xinzi Group scored another goal within ten minutes due to being too eager. After that, there was no more progress on either side. As a result, the Xinzi Group won with a score of 2 to 0, and the Xinzi Group won the championship with six points. The referee was Mr. He Chunhui.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Organizes Sports Federation</h3>
<p>The sports community in Suzhou, because there is usually no organization, lack of practice and research meetings, so the Soochow University Federation has organized the Suzhou Sports Federation with the entire Suzhou sports community. It was announced on the afternoon of the 25th and elected Xu Minhui as a standing committee member. Various competitions will be held regularly to prepare for the preliminary rounds of the Jiangsu Provincial and National Games. However, the Women's Sports Association, in order to maintain its inherent history and glory, decided not to add in the name of the entire school, but to allow each school to join freely, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Chairman of the Far Eastern Games Donates a Large Silver Cauldron Worth 2,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Country That Wins Three Consecutive Years Gets Permanent Preservation</p>
<p>The Public Plans to Collect Suspicions and Donate the China National Cup</p>
<p>Women's Basketball Games Use Men's Rules</p>
<p>The prizes for previous Far Eastern Games have been very rich, but we have never had a huge trophy. This time, Chairman Jiang of the National Government, in order to encourage athletes, instructed the National Sports Promotion Association to make a huge silver cauldron worth more than 2,000 yuan as a permanent prize for the Games. The country that wins three consecutive years will get permanent preservation. In addition, the people of our country are also planning to find ways to collect money to cast a permanent prize, named the "China National Cup." If it succeeds, it will be of the same nature as the "Emperor's Cup" of Japan and the "Governor's Cup" of the Philippines, and will be comparable to Japan and the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball Uses Men's Rules</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Sports Promotion Association recently received an official reply from the secretariat of the Japan Sports Association, stating that the basketball and baseball games for women's performance in the Games will adopt the newly established men's rules of the United States from 1929 to 1930 as the standard. It has been found that women's basketball in our country, in Shanghai, has always used the latest two-zone American rules, and other places also use two-zone rules. However, only Guangdong Fangxu uses men's rules. If the women's team in our country wants to participate in Japan this time, Shanghai and other places must pay attention to it. Because the National Games is also a preliminary round for the Far Eastern Games, it seems necessary to discuss the rules for women's basketball.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Gold Price Soared Again</h3>
<p>Highest 504 Taels</p>
<p>Closing Price 501 Taels 1 Mace</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the price of silver in Europe fell to a new low, and the local foreign exchange market was very weak. The listed prices were all historically low. Speculators rushed to buy gold pounds and gold foreign currency, and banks were unwilling to sell them, causing the price of gold to rise to 504 taels at a certain time in the morning, setting a new record. The price fell slightly in the afternoon, but the closing price was still 501 taels and 1 mace.</p>
<h3>Foreign Steamships Increase Freight Again</h3>
<p>To be Implemented Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>During the low-water period last winter on the Changsha route in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, when Chinese ships were suspended, foreign ships such as Taikoo, Nissin, and Jardine increased the freight by one-fold. By early February of this year, the water level rose slightly, and Chinese ships resumed operation, so the foreign companies reduced the added freight. Now, because the Chinese merchant ships on this route have stopped operating one after another, foreign ships such as Taikoo are once again taking advantage of the opportunity, saying that the water level above Hankou has decreased again, and they are discussing increasing the freight by 50%. Yesterday, the companies had already agreed to implement the increase tomorrow. The freight per ton has increased from 5 taels and 4 mace to 8 taels and 1 mace. The minimum bill of lading has increased from 2 taels to 2 taels and 5 mace. Because the new freight rates for other goods are of great concern to Chinese merchants, a survey has been conducted and divided into one or two categories as follows: (All goods must first go to Hankou, so two batches of freight must be paid to reach Changsha.)</p>
<p>Goods Name Weight Original Price New Price Including Hankou Fee</p>
<p>Tael Mace Tael Mace Tael Mace</p>

<h3>Sanbei Company's Flying Tiger Ship Sinks</h3>
<p>The Branch Office Has Received a Telegram from Hankou</p>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Flying Tiger ship, which came to Shanghai from Vladivostok last winter, was dispatched to Nanjing and Hankou. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from its Hankou branch, reporting that the ship had been struck and sunk by a warship. The original telegram was very brief, stating that the Flying Tiger ship was at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Hankou at noon yesterday (the 27th).</p>
<p>As the ship was being moved, it was violently struck amidships by a Chinese warship there. The hull of the Flying Tiger ship immediately broke open, and the river water rushed into the cabin, causing the ship to sink into the river. Within half an hour, the entire ship had sunk into the river. Fortunately, there was no cargo on board, and the crew members and sailors escaped to the China Merchants Bureau wharf during the accident, so there were no casualties. Details have not yet been reported. The Flying Tiger ship had a deadweight of more than 2,000 tons, and the total loss of the ship is more than 100,000 yuan. It is heard that the ship's hull was insured with marine insurance. After receiving the telegram yesterday, the bureau notified the insurance company for investigation.</p>

In the future, all officers and men of our entire department will not be allowed to take leave at any time without important reasons in order to fulfill their duties, etc. After the instructions, he accompanied Chief of Staff Teng Jiushou to inspect each battery garrison battalion, etc., and returned to the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Please Disclose the Full Text of the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement First</h3>
<p>National Products Factory Union Sends Telegram to the Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Union telegraphed the National Government Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry, and Commerce yesterday, stating that reports indicate that all issues in the Sino-Japanese tariff negotiations have been resolved and that the treaty will be signed soon. Regarding the reciprocal agreement, Japan has proposed more than 100 items such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth, all of which are industrial re-products. The reciprocal tariff items that our country imports from Japan are mostly raw materials, and the number is not as large as Japan's. Reading it is quite astonishing. It is undeniable that our country's industry is backward and commerce is sluggish. Japan has numerous factories and very rich products, which are sold in large quantities to our country. Examining the recent customs trade booklets, the comparison between raw material exports and product imports is far apart. To plug the leaks, increasing taxes is not enough, so how can they be included in reciprocity? Reciprocity means that each side is mutually beneficial. Now, exchanging raw materials from backward industries for products from developed industries is beneficial to Japan and harmful to us, and is not reciprocity, but cutting ourselves with a knife. If the reports are true, it will greatly hinder the future of promoting national products. At a time when national products factories are struggling, if their products are allowed to be included in reciprocity, it will be tantamount to cutting off their own lifeblood. What is felt to be dangerous cannot be kept silent, so a special telegram is sent to request that the full text of the agreement be disclosed before it is signed so that it can be studied to avoid regrets. Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Bingsen, Shen Mengshi, Xu Jianfan, and Ma Jisheng, standing committee members of the Shanghai National Products Factory Union, respectfully bow.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Import and Export Trade Statistics for January of this Year</h3>
<p>Much Less than Last Year</p>
<p>According to a survey, the total amount of Shanghai's import trade statistics for January of this year is about 50 million customs taels, and the export trade is 34 million taels, which is much less than the same period last year. Obstacles to transportation and sluggish market conditions are important reasons, it is said.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Unions Request Complete Unification Telegraph</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special City New New Company Employees Union, Huasheng Electric Union, New Iron Factory Union, First Weaving Factory Union, Wing On Second Yarn Factory Union, British Gas Company Union, Zhufeng Porcelain Enamel Factory Union, Huazhuang Binding Industry Zhabei District Union, Yongtai Cigar Factory Union, Yifeng Porcelain Enamel Factory Union, Jingyi Leather Factory Union, North District Silk Factory Seventh Business Union, North District Silk Factory Eighth Business Union, Coal and Firewood Union, China Bus Company Employees Union, Pig Bristle Union, and more than 30 other trade unions telegraphed yesterday, stating that the members of this association entrust their lives to the Qingbai flag and only know to embrace the hope of peaceful national salvation and want to taste the convenience of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Therefore, those who pretend to make concessions and secretly sabotage, damage unity, and hinder reorganization are all considered counter-revolutionary culprits and dare to be abandoned by the public. It is hoped that our wise central government and brave Chairman Chiang will promote the revolutionary spirit and complete the unification cause. This is what this association prays for three times.

<h3>National General Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Reduce Postal Rates for Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce cabled the National Government yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing National Government: It has been found that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the cancellation of overseas Chinese letter offices in various locations. Henceforth, bulk mailings are prohibited, and each letter must be individually affixed with a stamp. We have repeatedly received reports from the subordinate associations and reports from the British Executive Committee, as well as letters and telegrams from the Shantou General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that we forward a telegram requesting the continuation of the old practices. We have accordingly cabled the Ministry of Communications, ordering the General Post Office to continue the old practices to alleviate the difficulties of the overseas Chinese. However, we have repeatedly received replies from the Ministry stating that since our country has joined the Universal Postal Union, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are unwilling to send bulk mailings, and there is nothing that can be done. Now, upon reading a news item published in the Shanghai Shen Bao on February 26th, regarding the petition of overseas Chinese in Singapore for a reduction in postal rates, it is stated that the Governor of Singapore, the Chinese Affairs Commissioner, the Postmaster General, and others replied that this matter was not initiated by the British government, but was based on a letter from the Chinese government requesting the abolition of bulk mailings and a uniform increase in rates, and they presented various letters from the Chinese General Post Office, etc. After reading this, we are extremely dismayed. Our government daily declares its protection of overseas Chinese, but they have not received any actual benefits, and exploitation is rampant. The increase in postal rates and the abolition of bulk mailings are clear evidence of this. We hereby request that your esteemed government investigate and verify the matter, and immediately order the Executive Yuan to strictly order the Ministry of Communications and the General Post Office to immediately withdraw the order and continue the old practices, in order to safeguard the overseas Chinese. This would be a great act of kindness."</p>
<p>[P Postal Director-General Discusses the Issue of Bulk Mail Delivery by Nanyang Private Letter Offices]</p>
<p>The Postal Director-General of the local Ministry of Communications spoke in detail to a reporter from the Guomin News Agency yesterday regarding the issue of bulk mail delivery by Nanyang private letter offices. The following is a record of the discussion, for the reference of those concerned with overseas Chinese affairs. (The following is the Postal Director-General's statement): "In French Annam, American Philippines, Dutch East Indies, British Malayan Archipelago and Siam, there are many overseas Chinese from our country. Their communications with the mainland are mostly handled by private letter offices. The method of receiving and sending mail is to pack a large number of letters into a bulk package and send it as one item. When the bulk package arrives at its destination, it is received by the receiving private letter office, which then distributes the letters in the package to the recipients. In recent years, the postal administrations of various countries have protested to our country, requesting the abolition of this type of bulk package, as it conflicts with the Universal Postal Convention and their domestic regulations. Although we have repeatedly tried to deal with the situation, Annam, the Philippines, and Siam have successively implemented the abolition of bulk mailings. The Dutch postal administration has also repeatedly sent letters since 1925, requesting the abolition of bulk mailings. Our country's postal administration has always politely requested postponement. However, in August 1928, they sent letters and telegrams, firmly reiterating their previous proposal and refusing to make further concessions. Our country is a member of the Universal Postal Union and has an obligation to comply with the Universal Postal Convention. Since the Dutch postal administration has strictly enforced its domestic regulations based on the Universal Postal Convention and firmly rejected our requests, we have no way to force them to make concessions. We have reported this matter to the Ministry of Communications for record. Furthermore, in August 1929, the postal administration of Kuala Lumpur, British Malaya, sent a telegram stating that the governments of the Malayan Archipelago and the Nanyang Islands had decided to abolish the private letter office system and would implement it starting from January 1, 1930. While we were reviewing the matter, we received a letter from the Kuala Lumpur postal administration on September 2, reiterating their previous request and demanding the abolition of bulk mailings. Our country's postal administration repeatedly requested postponement and sent personnel to Xiamen and Shantou to discuss solutions with the relevant private letter offices, informing them of the situation and proposing appropriate solutions that comply with the Universal Postal Convention and the regulations of the British postal administration. The purpose was to ensure that communications for overseas Chinese would not be inconvenienced by the British postal administration's abolition of private letter offices, and that our country's postal administration would not be accused of violating the Universal Postal Convention. The facts are all there and can be reviewed. Now, a report states that the Governor of Singapore and the Postmaster General have presented letters from our bureau, stating that this matter was initiated by our government requesting the abolition of bulk mailings, which is contrary to the facts. We believe that the British authorities would not go so far as to reverse the truth. We have sent a telegram to question them and have submitted the entire case to the Ministry of Communications for review and handling, in order to clarify the truth. In short, our bureau has always taken the convenience of the public as its duty, and we will pay special attention to the convenience of overseas Chinese. This misunderstanding should be resolved soon."</p>

The Transportation Department of the railway has notified all stations. From now on, passengers will have considerably more convenience.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Nanshi Wharf Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th of this month at 2:00 PM, the Port Authority convened the Nanshi Wharf Evaluation Committee to discuss various matters related to the reorganization of the Nanshi coastline wharves, with the participation of the heads of the Land, Public Works, and Finance Bureaus, as well as representatives from shipping companies. The following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the discussion of the financial inventory reported by the Dada Company, it was found that the first item was already included in the existing wharves and did not need to be valued separately. The second and fourth items had already been offset against the loan from the former Municipal Council. Now that the loan has been repaid, it is naturally unnecessary to repay the loan item. The third item cannot be considered as property. The tenth and eleventh items were added to the contract in August 1917, stating that all annual dredging and maintenance expenses prior to the rent increase had been paid by the Dada Company in the amount of over 20,000 taels of silver, and would not be repaid by the council. There would be no further rent increases in the future, and the Dada Company would be responsible for the maintenance of the wooden hulls. Therefore, it is naturally impossible to request repayment again. In addition, the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 12th, and 13th items will be depreciated annually according to the original reported prices. Should this be decided by the public? (Resolution) The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th, and 6th items cannot be recognized for valuation based on the above reasons. The 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 12th, and 13th items will be depreciated according to their age and valued for repayment. (2) Regarding the discussion of the property inventory reported by the Minxing Company, it was found that the 1st and 2nd categories reported by the company were for company preparation expenses and property, which cannot be compared with wharf assets and should not be valued for recovery. As for the third category, the rent cannot be refunded. The security deposit will be used to offset the rent due, and the remainder will be refunded if there is a surplus. The 1st and 2nd items in the fourth category will be appropriately reduced for repayment. The 3rd and 4th items will be depreciated and valued for repayment according to the reported prices. Should this be decided by the public? (Resolution) The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd categories, as well as the 1st and 2nd items in the fourth category, will be handled according to the above method. However, the 3rd and 4th items in the fourth category will be recovered at the original prices reported by the company after verifying the evidence. (3) Regarding the discussion of the valuation inventory of various companies reported by the specialist committee, it was found that the valuation of Dada's No. 7 wharf was 1,000 taels higher than the company's original reported price, and the depreciation was not calculated according to age, which was somewhat excessive. Should it be re-evaluated and discussed? Please decide by public vote. (Resolution) The original committee will re-verify the valuation and provide copies of the original price lists reported by Dada and Minxing for reference.</p>
<h3>Pacific Shipping Industry in Decline</h3>
<p>Since the drastic reduction in fares by Japanese ships, Shanghai has faced a situation of many ships and few goods, with an oversupply of tonnage. Recently, with the reduction in freight rates by liners from New York, many Shanghai exports to the United States are being directly loaded onto New York ships, which has led to a sharp decline in exports on Pacific ships. The Osaka Company in the city has decided to suspend all its commercial ships on the Pacific line from coming to China for one month, starting today, to avoid unexpected losses such as tonnage fees.</p>
<h3>Investigation into Concession Telephone Issues</h3>
<p>The Review Committee Will Publish its Opinions</p>
<p>The Wenhui Bao reports that the Advisory Committee for investigating the telephone issue in the concessions and reviewing the terms of the three companies' purchase will hold a special meeting on Monday to consider the additional proposals from the French Concession Municipal Council and the Public Concession Council. It is said that the bids submitted by the three companies cannot be discussed without modification. The committee will publish its opinions after the meeting on Monday.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchants' Representatives Request Exemption from Inspection</h3>
<p>Director Zou Agrees to Submit to the Ministry on Their Behalf</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is scheduled to begin inspecting exported raw silk on the 1st of this month (tomorrow). However, Chinese and foreign silk merchants have encountered many obstacles. Merchants of factory white, yellow, and gray silk have elected representatives to go to the ministry and bureau to explain the difficulties in implementation and request assistance. It is now known that foreign merchants have telegraphed their headquarters in New York and Lyon for instructions, and they have now replied to Shanghai with differing opinions. American silk merchants have requested a postponement until June 1, when the new silk is on the market, to implement the inspection, while French silk merchants have requested implementation on January 1 of next year, refusing to accept any of the strip samples drawn. The Export Silk Association has sent a letter to the Jiangzhe Silk Factory Association in response. Yesterday (27th) at 2:00 PM, the association sent representatives Huang Jinchen, Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, and Huang Jinfan to meet with Director Zou of the Commodity Inspection Bureau to present the difficulties encountered in inspecting exported raw silk and submit the Export Silk Association's letter for review. Director Zou met with them for a while and agreed to submit their request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and compliance. The four representatives then took their leave.</p>
<p>The Industrial Bureau Displays Road Maps for the Year</p>

All sectors should be aware of this notice. Dated February 27, 1930, Edward, General Manager."</p>
<h3>Ms. Smith Withdraws from the Board of Directors Candidacy</h3>
<p>Following the Wishes of the American Government</p>
<p>The Wenhui Bao reports that Ms. Smith, the American Commercial Attaché and member of the Board of Directors candidate, has withdrawn from the election this morning (27th) after receiving a telegram from the U.S. State Department, stating that it would be inappropriate for Ms. Smith to hold public office and participate in the election. She told the reporter from this newspaper that she feared that foreign parties might misunderstand and view her participation as a competition representing the U.S. government, so she withdrew from the candidacy. Initially, the women's community in the city wanted to take this opportunity to nominate a candidate and earnestly persuaded her to run. She knew that there might be difficulties on the part of the U.S. government, but she had always supported the principle of establishing female candidates and noted that women were listed in the Municipal Council's electoral roll together with consular officials and other diplomats, so she readily agreed. Now, no objections have been raised among the Municipal Council personnel regarding the nomination of female candidates or her eligibility for election. Her withdrawal is purely due to following the wishes of her government and avoiding causing misunderstandings from the outside world. However, she still hopes that the women in the city will continue to pay close attention to municipal affairs, exercise all their rights, and express her gratitude to those who support the women's election and the expansion of the scope of nomination of candidates. The well-intentioned publicity from the newspapers is also deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Municipal Council also officially stated yesterday that the bureau's authority cannot directly inform or petition the governments of London or Washington. Even formal letters to the ministers must be conveyed through the consul. As for formal petitions to the British and American governments, they must be forwarded by the British and American ministers. The bureau can never directly reach the two governments.</p>

<h3>Appeal of the Ningtai Fish Merchants</h3>
<p>The Wuchen News Agency reports that the Ningtai fish merchants issued a summary yesterday regarding the increase in commissions by various firms, requesting assistance from all sectors. The text reads: "We, the ice-fresh fish merchants, often transport fresh fish from the seas near Shengshan and Daishan to Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places, distributing them to various fish firms for sale on our behalf. The Dunhe Guild and various fish firms in Shanghai deduct numerous commission items from the sale price of our fish, according to past practice. First, they deduct 99%, then they deduct 9.88% from the 99%, and from the 9.88%, they deduct 9.3%, called 'firm commission,' and then they deduct 0.1%, called 'stack labor.' What is even more unreasonable is that the expenses of the guild organized by the firms are not borne by the firms themselves but are instead taken from the fish merchants, deducting another 0.1% from the aforementioned firm commission and stack labor, called 'public fee.' Therefore, the fish merchants only receive 90.3 yuan for every 100 yuan of fish value. In 1926, the firms, citing increased cost of living and huge expenses, added another 1% commission, so that we only receive 89.753 yuan for every 100 yuan. Alas, we fish merchants are small-scale businesses, risking danger in the open seas and pirate attacks. Because we lack knowledge and unity, we are at the mercy of others, enduring the pain. However, the firms are still not satisfied. Starting this year, they have suddenly added another 1% commission, claiming that they have obtained approval from the Social Affairs Bureau. We fish merchants can no longer tolerate this and are forced to make a final struggle. We hereby state the reasons for our opposition, hoping that you benevolent gentlemen will show compassion and examine the situation. First, the firms have again cited increased cost of living as the reason for this commission increase. It is not known that the commission was already increased by 1% in 1926, and the collective income of the firms has increased by about 100,000 yuan per year compared to before 1926. Only three years have passed, and they suddenly increased the commission again. How can the fish merchants endure this? Moreover, the increased cost of living is not only felt by the firms. The fish merchants also feel the pain of increased cost of living. Not only is there no compensation, but we must also bear the increased burden. In terms of sentiment and reason, how can this be considered fair? This is the first reason why we cannot agree. Second, in recent years, due to the intrusion of Japanese frozen fish into the market, most fish merchants have suffered losses. This is a fact that can be proven, and the firms also know this very well. Now, assuming that each fresh fish boat does 40,000 yuan of business per year, the increased commission will suddenly increase the loss by 400 yuan. Except for the boats that suffer losses, the boats that are fortunate enough to make a profit only make 300 to 500 yuan per boat. In that case, do we fish merchants still have hope of not suffering losses? This is the second reason why we cannot agree. Third, the business of fresh fish boats begins in September of each year and ends in August of the following year. The borrowing of funds and the hiring of partners all begin in September. Whether the business continues or not is also decided at this time. If the firms had announced the commission increase before September of last year, then we fish merchants would still have the freedom to consider whether or not it is worthwhile to continue the business. Now, they did not announce it in advance but secretly reported to the government offices to seek profit, leaving the fish merchants unable to advance or retreat. There is no way to avoid being completely exploited. This is close to entrapment. This is the third reason why we cannot agree. Fourth, the expenses of various industry guilds are borne by the industries themselves. This is the case in Shanghai and in every industry. Now, Dunhe is taking the funds from the fish merchants, forcing them to bear unexpected obligations. Since the extraction of public fees, it has been more than ten years. At 10,000 yuan per year, the burden that we fish merchants bear for the Dunhe Guild is almost more than 150,000 yuan. It can be said that this guild is owned by the fish merchants. Our hard-earned money is taken at will, but the fish merchants have absolutely no right to enjoy any benefits from the guild. This 0.1% public fee is only used to provide the guild's extravagance, superstition, and the weekly banquets of the firm managers. The world says there are oppressed classes. It is likely referring to us fish merchants. This is the fourth reason why we cannot agree. In summary, it can be seen whether the firms' sudden increase in commission and extraction of public fees is reasonable. We fish merchants are the weak and can only sincerely appeal to all the gentlemen in all sectors, hoping that they will have mercy on our difficult and oppressed situation and grant us salvation. We present our words with tears, only expressing a hundredth of our feelings. We are at your urgent command."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Attempts to Manufacture Bovine Pest Serum</h3>
<p>Our country's rural farmers mostly rely on cattle power for cultivation, but there is often the problem of cattle plague, which is actually caused by bovine pest. According to investigations, in the vicinity of Shanghai alone, a bovine pest outbreak occurred in early December of last year, affecting various dairy farms in Pudong. Later, it was completely stopped in mid-January of this year, thanks to serum relief. In less than two months, the various dairy farms had lost as many as 300 cattle. There are currently no domestic manufacturing facilities for this serum, which specifically treats bovine pest, and most of it must be supplied by foreigners at a very high cost, resulting in the outflow of profits, which is a great pity. In fact, manufacturing this serum is not difficult. With sufficient equipment and a few months of operation, a large quantity of products can be produced, sufficient to provide relief from bovine pest. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, recognizing this, believes that although this undertaking is not within the scope of inspection, the experts' focus on academic research has always been advocated by the bureau. This matter is related to agricultural economy, and if it can be actively researched, it will have a great impact. Therefore, it has specifically opened up five mu of land in Jiangwan to engage in research. Veterinarian Yi Wenzhi from the Livestock Product Inspection Office brought back multiple bottles of bovine pest resistant serum and antitoxin from the Philippines. Currently, Yi Wenzhi is collaborating with the bureau's veterinarian Luo Qingsheng and technician Shou Biao to conduct trials, which have had a good response. It is expected that they will be able to manufacture and apply it in the near future.</p>
<h3>Xin Kang Case Prepared for Prosecution</h3>
<p>The case of the Zhao Shang Bureau's Xin Kang steamer being sunk by the Japanese ship Longye Maru has been repeatedly negotiated by the diplomatic authorities with no effect. The Zhao Shang Bureau and the bereaved families believe that the delay is insufficient to promote justice and deter future occurrences. It has now been decided to file a lawsuit against the Japanese Mail Steamship Company to seek a legal solution to hold the Longye Maru accountable. It was originally intended to file the lawsuit in the court at the location of the incident, but since the location of the incident is far in Shandong, it is too inconvenient. Therefore, it has been decided to file the lawsuit nearby in the Shanghai court. All legal procedures have been fully prepared. It is reported that the bereaved families' association has entrusted Dr. Sheng Zhen, Dean of the Soochow Law School and Doctor of American Law, as their attorney to handle all litigation procedures.</p>
<h3>Yuan Li Ship Requests Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>190,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Yuan Li steamer of the Zhengji Company, after being sunk by a Japanese mail ship, has repeatedly tried to salvage it, but has been unable to do so. The company has contacted the Japanese Mail Steamship Company several times, but there has been no solution. It was heard yesterday that the Zhengji Company has sent a formal representative to Shanghai to demand 190,000 yuan in compensation for losses from the Japanese Mail Steamship Company. The Japanese Mail Steamship Company has not made a specific statement, and the two sides are in negotiations, while also sending personnel to investigate all the circumstances.</p>
<h3>How to Save Major Industries</h3>
<p>Compiled and Printed by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the fact that the city's various industries and businesses are under the economic aggression of the great powers and are affected by the high price of gold and low price of silver, not only have no possibility of development, but even their inherent foundation is in a precarious state, has sent personnel to investigate the current situation of the city's silk, tea, flour, silk weaving, cotton weaving, match, and soap industries, as well as the root causes of their problems, and compiled and printed the book "How to Save Major Industries."</p>
<p>It has already been published, and the content focuses on improving raw materials, production, reducing taxes and fees, promoting the productivity of workers, government rewards and subsidies, and tariff protection. Each item has been carefully researched and listed as a problem. It is reported that several hundred copies have been submitted to the municipal government and sent to the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters and the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting that they be distributed to the representatives of the Third Plenary Session and the Sixth Plenary Session to provide a reference for discussing industrial issues, in order to determine the rescue policy. The book is also being negotiated with major bookstores in the city for consignment sales, with a price of 0.2 silver yuan.</p>

<h3>A Tale of Wonder: Giant Rat Bites and Injures Three</h3>
<p>The whole family startled awake in the middle of the night</p>
<p>Giant rat simultaneously bites and injures three</p>
<p>The rat escapes despite being injured by a stick</p>
<p>Nearby residents are uneasy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that in a residence at 36 Taiheng Li (transliteration), North Sichuan Road, on Tuesday night, a seven-year-old Chinese child suddenly cried out. His mother rushed to check and saw one large and one small rat jump off the bed. The child's lower lip was bleeding profusely, having been bitten by the rat in his sleep. The mother quickly got up to chase the rats, but while the small one escaped, the giant rat stood its ground and even lunged forward, biting the woman twice. The woman screamed, and the whole family gathered to help and capture the rat together. Although the rat was injured by a stick, it still managed to escape. Another person was also bitten on the ankle by the rat. The woman and her child have now been sent to the hospital. This matter was reported to the Chinese Health Bureau, which yesterday sent people with rat traps and other equipment to the residence to try to catch it, but they only caught two or three small rats. Now, the homes and shops in the surrounding area are all uneasy. Some say that they have recently seen a rat, huge and unnamed, which may be the culprit.</p>
<h3>The Detective Team Cracked Another Kidnapping Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>A ten-year-old hostage rescued</p>
<p>The kidnappers are still being strictly pursued</p>
<p>Since the City Public Security Bureau's detective team solved the Chen Tianxi kidnapping case, people in Shanghai have admired the team's swiftness in solving cases. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, the team cracked another kidnapping case, rescuing the hostage on the spot. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sudden secret report: Around two o'clock yesterday morning, Captain Qiao suddenly received a secret report from an informant, stating that Xu Jiarong, the young son of Xu Wanglun, a local resident of 55 Tanjiazhai, Zhabei, was kidnapped without a trace near the Sun Temple Jiaotong Road in Zhabei on January 3 of this year. It was learned that the hostage was currently hidden in Room 7 of a certain hotel in Taiyuan Fang, Xizilaihuo Street, Caishi Street, French Concession. Please send personnel to arrest them immediately, and so on. After receiving the report, Captain Qiao immediately gathered a large number of officers to make the arrest.</p>
<p>Hostage rescued: After receiving the report, Captain Qiao immediately joined Deputy Captain Lu Ying and led squad leader Wang Shifu, Su Sheng, detectives Wang Yao, Lu Xingchun, Dou Yulin, etc., in several cars to first report to the French General Police Station. The police chief immediately ordered several detectives to go with them. When they arrived at the hotel, they saw the name Zhu Fulin listed for Room 7 on the guest list. They then went upstairs together and found Room 7 locked. The room attendant said that last night (the 26th) at around eight o'clock, two men and one woman came with a child. This morning (yesterday), the men and women all went out together, ordering the door to be locked, saying that the child was lying in the room. They have not returned since leaving.</p>
<p>Personnel dispatched to guard: After the room attendant finished speaking, Captain Qi immediately ordered the door to be opened. They saw the young hostage lying on the bed and immediately rescued him. They then opened another room nearby, selected officers to guard it, and waited until dawn, but no one came. They immediately took the hostage back to the team and questioned him in detail about everything that happened. Although the hostage was only ten years old, he was unusually lively and immediately explained everything one by one, including how he was kidnapped that day, how he was transferred and hidden, how he missed his parents, and how he was abused by the kidnappers, until he escaped danger. Captain Qiao then ordered officers to notify the hostage's family and submitted a written report to the director.</p>
<p>Nine bandits in total: According to the hostage Xu Jiarong, whose milk name is Genfa, is ten years old. His father's name is Yulun, is thirty-six years old. His brother's name is Jiazhen, is seventeen. The eldest sister is Lanying, is twenty-one. The second sister is Lanzhen, is nineteen. There is also a one- or two-year-old younger brother. On January 3, at around four o'clock in the afternoon, he was returning home from school, passing near Jiaotong Road, when two bandits, one wearing an overcoat and one wearing an oilskin coat, each holding a pistol, grabbed me (the hostage referring to himself) and dragged me onto a rickshaw parked by the road, using the coat to cover me. Before long, we arrived at a place where I spent the night. There were nine bandits in total, with five guns. The next day, they sent me to the Jiangwan countryside, where I lived for a total of forty-seven days. Then, I was moved to 822 Jinyang Li, Peikai'er Road, Yangshupu, where I lived for six days. It was not until the night before last that I was brought to the hotel, and this morning (yesterday) I was rescued.</p>
<p>Searching everywhere: After Captain Qiao finished asking, he again ordered detectives Fu Zhengcai, Wang Yao, Lu Xingchun, Dou Yulin, Gao Juchuan, Wu Xiufeng, Han Ruisheng, Wang Zijun, Wu Zuorong, etc., to take the hostage and search in Jiangwan and Yangshupu. However, the hostage was very young, and also just returned from the bandits' den, and was still frightened, so he could not identify things clearly. The detectives returned to the team to report. Captain Qiao ordered a thorough investigation to be carried out, and those involved to be brought to justice.</p>
<p>Assassination case on Xie Xu Road last night</p>
<p>The deceased was Zheng Huaishan, the murderers totaled two</p>
<p>At around seven o'clock last night, a revenge killing occurred in Wu Fuxing firewood shop on Xie Lu, Nanshi. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden thugs: Zheng Huaishan, thirty-four years old, from Yancheng, made a living by opening Zheng Xiej firewood shop. At seven o'clock last night, Zheng walked to Wu Fuxing firewood shop to settle accounts. Unexpectedly, while he was chatting and laughing with the young owner of Wu Fuxing firewood shop, two unidentified thugs, both around twenty years old, one wearing a blue silk and linen long gown, with a rope hat, and a pockmarked face, and the other wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, both carrying pistols, rushed into the room and violently attacked Zheng. There were more than ten shots, bang, bang.</p>
<p>Instant death: Zheng was caught off guard and unable to dodge. He was shot three times on the right side of his neck, once on his left temple, once on his right chest, and once directly below his navel, for a total of six shots. Blood spurted like a fountain, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. A stray bullet hit Yan Chengren, the accountant of Wu Fuxing firewood shop, injuring his left calf. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Interrogation of suspects: Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the two bandits swaggered out the door and fled. The police on duty were immediately notified and found six wooden-cased pistol cartridges in the room. The police took six suspects, Cao Hongzhang, Jiang Zhongxiang, Miao Yuquan, Dai Xu's, Chen Xu's, and the deceased's wife, Zheng Yan's, to the district for questioning. According to their statements, the deceased had professional jealousy with Miao Yuquan during his lifetime, and conflicts often arose. Last August, Zheng was once assassinated but was not hit, and so on. The district office is conducting a detailed investigation of this case and is determined to arrest the murderers in the short term.</p>
<h3>Loss of Cash and Foreign Money After Leaving the Store, False Report of Theft and Robbery</h3>
<p>More than one thousand yuan disappeared without a trace</p>
<p>Feared reprimand and fabricated a report</p>
<p>Fortunately, his character was usually good</p>
<p>Lenient punishment with a fine</p>
<p>Chen Ading, a Ningbo native who worked at the Beijing Road Coal Industry Bank, had been serving in the bank for more than eleven years. He was quite honest and usually made no mistakes in his work, so he was trusted. The day before yesterday, the bank manager ordered him to take more than four thousand yuan in banknotes and pay them to various banks. Chen first went to Sumitomo Bank on Jiujiang Road and paid 853 yuan. Then, he went to the Taiwan Bank on the Bund and paid 2,100 yuan. He also went to the Bank of China and paid 300 yuan. There was still 1,112.5 yuan left, which he planned to deliver to HSBC. Unexpectedly, after leaving the Bank of China, Chen reached into his pocket and found that the remaining banknotes had all disappeared. He was shocked and did not know how they were lost. Fearing reprimand, he acted impulsively without even considering the consequences. He went to the General Police Station and said that the banknotes in his pocket were intercepted by four bandits on the way out of the Bank of China. Two bandits held pistols and forced him into the alley next to the Longmao Foreign Firm on Guangdong Road, forcibly searching him and taking all the money. He requested an investigation. The police chief suspected Chen's story, as he would have had to pass four police posts from the Bank of China to Guangdong Road. Why didn't he report to the police post? The police chief immediately sent detective Pang Ruiqing and detective Zhang Jinlong to investigate, but there was no evidence to support Chen's claim. They then questioned Chen strictly. Chen was indeed guilty and finally confessed that the banknotes were lost. He was afraid of being punished, so he fabricated a report in the hope of evading responsibility. The police chief arrested him and sent him to the Provisional Court yesterday morning, prosecuting him for false accusation under Article 182 of the Criminal Law. Judge Zhou interrogated him. According to Chen's confession, he was confused after the loss, which led to this action. The bank hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to appear in court and state that the defendant's character was usually good. This time, he was afraid of being reprimanded, so he made a false report and requested lenient punishment. Judge Zhou then sentenced him to a lenient fine of 160 yuan as a warning.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Tyrant from Nantong Continued Yesterday</h3>
<p>Teachers Xu Yanggao, Zhou Yixiu, and Li Jiagu, etc., reported that Xu Shanji, Wu Xuan, and other local bullies and gentry in the Xiting District of Nantong had embezzled huge sums of money. The case was publicly heard by the Shanghai District Court but was not concluded. Xu Shanji and Wu Xuan were released on bail pending further trial. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, Judge Deng opened the court for further hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer, Ma Junshuo, along with the plaintiffs Zhou Yixiu, Xu Yanggao, Li Jiagu, and witnesses Xu Botong, Xu Shiping, Qin Yueqing, etc., arrived in court one after another. The defendants Xu Shanji and Wu Xuan were not summoned. Lawyer Chen was delayed but appeared in court as their representative, requesting an adjournment. Zhou Yixiu briefly described the main points of the lawsuit, and then Xu Yanggao, Li Jiagu, and others each submitted written statements detailing how the defendants had encroached on the Second Five Treasury Bonds, arbitrarily established city loans, and engaged in illegal activities. Xu Botong testified that because the account books transferred by the former Municipal Office did not match, he convened local people to hold a review meeting. The meeting concluded that the accounts of the Second Five Treasury Bonds did not match, and that the city loans were extorted from the villagers by the defendants under false pretenses. The receipts and expenditure accounts for the river embankment fee and the land survey fee, as well as the maps, were never handed over. Xu Shiping testified that his family was solicited for eighty yuan in Second Five Treasury Bonds, which the defendant arbitrarily changed to a city loan. He said that the Second Five Treasury Bonds were a national loan, so the receipt was simply referred to as a loan. They repeatedly asked him to return the Second Five Treasury Bonds, but he said he had not received them. As for the announcement in the newspaper to solicit them, it was just a statement to the outside world. In reality, they could not get them back. The receipts he gave me were repeatedly requested and reissued after the money was received, and so on. Lawyer Ma said that there were many victims, most of whom did not come because they had no receipts. The official said that even without summonses, the victims were allowed to come on their own. Lawyer Ma also requested that the court open earlier to expedite the conclusion of the case. The judge agreed and ordered that since the defendants were not present today, the hearing would be adjourned to another date for review and judgment. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Police and Pirates at Da'an Port Outside Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>More than thirty pirates killed in battle</p>
<p>Five bandits captured alive and one hostage rescued</p>
<p>Chen Xin, the captain of the 18th team of the 4th district of the Wusong Water Police, suddenly received a secret report at around six o'clock in the morning the day before yesterday, stating that there were more than two hundred pirates aboard five large pirate ships near Xiaoyang Port, which belonged to the Tong area outside the Wusong estuary. After receiving the report, Captain Chen immediately ordered the second squad leader of the team to lead the entire team's patrol boat to quickly encircle and suppress them. When the patrol boat chased to Xiaoyang Port, the pirates had already received the news and raised their sails to escape. The patrol boat then pursued them from behind. When they met the pirate ships on the sea surface about five miles from Da'an Port, they immediately attacked. The pirate ships also resisted stubbornly. The gunfire from both sides was extremely fierce, and the battle lasted for five hours. More than thirty pirates were shot down into the water, and the pirates began to lose ground and flee. The patrol boat took advantage of the victory to pursue them and captured five pirates on the spot, and rescued one hostage. The patrol boat then ran out of ammunition and stopped pursuing them, allowing the pirate ships to escape. Captain Chen reported the situation to Zhu Bingzheng, the district chief of the fourth district, yesterday for the record.</p>
<h3>Tragic Deaths are Often Heard</h3>
<p>Wuhu native Xi Youfu, forty-six years old, tragically committed suicide by slitting his own throat. He was the head steward at the home of a certain Russian at 167 Guba Road, French Concession. The relationship between the host and guest was very harmonious. Xi suffered from a nervous disorder that flared up from time to time, but it is unknown why he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. At around six o'clock yesterday morning, he took a long knife and a pair of scissors used for work from the small room next to the kitchen of his master's house, sat on the edge of his bed, and slit his own throat. At that time, Xi fainted and fell to the ground due to the pain of having his throat cut, and blood covered the floor. The master discovered him and entered the room to check, and was horrified. He immediately reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Xi had already died. The wound was more than an inch deep. The knife used for the suicide was found next to the body and taken back to the police station. The detective reported to the police chief and notified the Tongren Zhuanyuantang to send staff to carry the body to the mortuary. Detectives were also sent to verify and summon Xi Youfu's brother, Xi Yousheng, and Xi Tang's, Xi's wife (who lived on Qiujiang Road, Hongkou) to the case. The Criminal Division reported to Judge Zhu of the French Concession, who arrived at the scene to examine the body. After taking his seat in public, Judge Zhu was informed by the detective of the previous situation. After questioning the family members of the deceased, Judge Zhu ordered that it be verified that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by slitting his own throat before his death, and that the family members should prepare a coffin and collect the body themselves.</p>
<p>Died of illness after drowning: On the 23rd of this month, a young man threw himself into the Huangpu River in the French Concession to commit suicide. The police caught sight of him, called for help from Xiuzi, and managed to rescue him. They took him to the police station. The police chief questioned him, but he only provided his surname, Wang, and his name, Junsheng, and his age, twenty-eight years old. He firmly refused to reveal the reason for his suicide. After the police chief found out that Wang was ill, he ordered him to be sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, which sent detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang mortuary. No family members were found. Yesterday, the police station reported to Judge Zhu of the French Concession, who arrived at the scene to verify that the deceased had indeed drowned and died of illness before his death. It was ordered that a photograph be taken and that Tongren Fuyuantang prepare a coffin and collect the body, and place it in the altar to await identification by family members.</p>
<p>Jiangbei child Zhang Amao, fourteen years old, was run over and killed by a car. He lived in a bungalow in Gujia Garden, Zhabei, and was a dock worker. At twelve o'clock yesterday afternoon, he was walking through the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Sichuan Road when he was suddenly run over and fatally injured by a certain truck. He died instantly. The driver, seeing that he had caused an accident, quickly sped away without a trace. Subsequently, police officer No. 2442 from the Huisi Police Station arrived at the scene, transported the body to Tongren Hospital, and then to the mortuary to await examination.</p>
<p>Jiangbei native Zhan Zicheng, a rickshaw puller, died of a sudden illness on the road. He lived at 90 Wangjiazhai, Zhabei. At seven o'clock yesterday morning, he took his rickshaw out to solicit passengers near Gaolang Bridge on Huade Road. He suddenly fell ill and collapsed on the ground. When Chinese policeman No. 1037 checked on him, he could not speak. He was transported to Tongren Hospital in a rickshaw, but by the time he arrived at the hospital gate, he had already died. The body was then carried to the Feilun Road mortuary. This morning, the police station reported to the Provisional Court, which commissioned Judge Luo Renji to arrive at the scene to verify that he had died of illness. He ordered Zhan Ziping, the deceased's brother, to sign a guarantee and collect the coffin.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Arrested in Baxianfang</h3>
<p>At around three o'clock yesterday morning, the Water Police Team sent personnel to the French General Police Station to report that there were many kidnappers hiding in the house at 16 Baxianfang, Huagenao Road, within the concession, requesting assistance in the arrest. The police chief immediately ordered several Chinese and Western detectives to go to the address together. They arrested three people in the front building of the house and immediately took them to the police station. According to Mr. Xiang, the second landlord of No. 16, on the 21st day of the twelfth month of the old calendar last year, a man wearing a felt hat and a bamboo skirt, about thirty years old, came to rent the front building, agreeing to a monthly rent of seventeen yuan, and paying a deposit of six yuan first. When asked what he did for a living, he replied that he worked in a rice shop and had four or five people in his family, including his wife, mother-in-law, and children. He moved in on the 26th. No one came to visit at first. Around the 10th of this month, four or five people wearing felt hats and bamboo skirts came upstairs and stayed for several hours before leaving.</p>
<p>Until about three o'clock this morning, a large number of detectives came, along with an informant, and arrested three people. There were still a few young women, old women, and young children upstairs. It was said that one of the people arrested was Liu Xiaomei, and the other one or two were unknown. The young woman, Wu, was originally married to Zhou Zirong in Lili, but was later sold by Zhou and escaped after being abused. She met Liu's rice boat in the harbor, and was brought to Shanghai by Liu. She rented the house. Usually, Liu forbade her from eavesdropping on his conversations with friends. The old woman was Wu's biological mother, Li, who came to Shanghai from Lili two days ago because Wu was pregnant and about to give birth.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Record of the Large Amount of Opium Seized on the Xianghe Steamer</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that before dawn on Tuesday, the General Police Station's Anti-Narcotics Team, along with customs officials and water police, seized a large amount of opium worth 80,000 yuan on the Xianghe steamer from the Yangtze River and arrested two people, who were transferred to the Chinese authorities for punishment. Previously, the police had long known that there was a very large opium trafficking organization in this city, whose activities not only extended to the Yangtze River area but also throughout the country. This time, they learned that a large amount of Yunnan and Sichuan opium was being transported by the Xianghe. After the ship arrived in Shanghai and docked near Zhaofeng Road on Monday afternoon, the Western police knew that a portion of it would be secretly transported into the concession. Therefore, they secretly monitored it at night and learned that the organization had hired hundreds of secret agents to watch the surroundings and pay attention to the detectives. Therefore, their actions were very secretive. They later learned that these people had hired several cars to smuggle a large amount of opium ashore. They hid near the pier and secretly waited. After a long time, they saw someone giving the signal to start transporting. The police immediately came out, but several workers were already carrying several bags down from the ship and were about to leave the pier gate. However, these people caught sight of the police and one of them closed the door and locked it. The workers also quickly carried the goods they were carrying back to the ship. After several twists and turns, the police managed to open the pier gate and rushed to the ship. However, since the ship was docked outside the concession, there were difficulties. Fortunately, with the help of the shipowner, they were able to board the ship. When they checked near a government cabin, they smelled opium. However, the door was locked and the key could not be found. The shipowner and the chief mate helped to open a window. One policeman reached in and found a small package of opium, and there were two people guarding it. These two people also did not have a key and seemed to be locked inside. They immediately notified the customs officials and the water police. When the water police arrived, they broke down the door and found eight bags of opium in the cabin. They then searched the coal bunker and found sixteen bags. They transported the opium to the customs warehouse and transferred the two people arrested to the Chinese authorities. When the ship passed through Wusong, anti-narcotics personnel boarded the ship and searched it once. It is said that several taels of opium were found.</p>
<h3>The Fu'an Life Insurance Company Fraud Case Concludes Arguments</h3>
<p>The Fu'an Life Insurance Company's Deng Zhongze fraud case continued with arguments yesterday, and the counterclaim portion was investigated. Judge Gao Junxiang presided over the hearing in the Tenth Court. First, the reasons for the counterclaim filed by the defendant Deng Zhongze were heard. He stated that Deng Wenhai was employed by the company and that his signature was on the policies he managed. The policies of Wu Hanzhou and Wu Shutang had expired and were invalid, and the accusations were false. Therefore, he filed a counterclaim. The counter-defendants Deng Wenhai and others stated that although they were directors in the Hong Kong company, the Chinese Fu'an Company was indeed falsely established by the defendant. However, they did not ask about the policy. I have paid thousands of yuan in life insurance premiums, and I was actually cheated, and so on. Wu Hanzhou briefly stated that the defendant claimed to be clearing up the accounts and refused to pay the fees. Later, I learned that the company was actually a scam, and so on. Wu Shutang was in Xuzhou and did not attend. His lawyer, Fei Guoxi, replied that the plaintiff's insurance premiums were usually paid one or two years late, but they were still accepted as usual. There are overdue receipts submitted as evidence. Shi then paid the fees and also received them, actually wanting to rely on all the premiums. After clearing up the accounts, why do you still use the name of Chinese Fu'an to collect the premiums for valid effective insurance policies? Moreover, the newspaper advertised by the defendant, one announced the clearing up of accounts, and the other still claimed that business was as usual, in order to continue his fraudulent means. When Judge Chen interrogated him, he said that the newspaper was printed in error. Now he said that the staff made a mistake. The testimony was inconsistent before and after, which is tantamount to confessing that his newspaper announcement was evidence of a crime. However, there is no reason for the counterclaim's false accusation. Please declare the counterclaim not guilty and decide the original lawsuit according to law, and so on. Then, lawyers He Shimie, Yu Zhongluo, Yao Jian, Fei Guoxi, Qu Yue, and Yang Kang made full arguments. At the end, the defendant's lawyer Wang Fuchang gave a lengthy reply, declaring the arguments</p>

<p>concluded, and the sentence was set for the afternoon of March 6, and so on.</p>
<h3>Young Woman and Yangzhou Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>The two are in love and do not want to separate</p>
<p>The world is getting worse, what a sigh</p>
<p>Liu Xu's, a woman from Yancheng, living at 285 Xiangqing Li, Shanhai Pass Road, Xin Zha, is over sixty years old. Her husband has been dead for many years. Her son, Xiang Sheng, married Liao, who is twenty-three years old, beautiful, and has given birth to a son who is two years old. Liao has always been well-behaved, but unexpectedly, last winter, she went to the Gonghe Yangzhou Theatre on Daohuangzhen Road, Zhabei, to watch a play and met the actor Dai Lanfang from 扬州. Dai is a famous 花旦 and is known as the Yangzhou Mei Lanfang. Therefore, Liao fell in love at first sight and an affair began. However, Dai was quite poor and all his daily expenses were completely dependent on Liao. They built a love nest at the fourth house in Yongxiang Li on Datong Road and often made secret appointments. Liao made excuses to visit relatives in Zhabei, and her husband did not suspect anything. However, recently, Xu noticed that her actions were strange and found that the ornaments and valuable clothes in her box had all disappeared. So she secretly investigated. Yesterday, she hugged her son and went to her lover's place. Liao secretly followed behind. When she arrived at the destination, she immediately broke in and reasoned with her, saying that my family is not poor, your husband is also a decent businessman, and you have already given birth to a son. Why do you do such a shameless thing? Quickly return with me, repent and start over. However, Liao not only did not agree but also said that I love him (referring to Dai) and want to grow old with him. I want to divorce your son. Xu listened to her words and was very angry. She went out and called the police on duty and took her daughter-in-law and Dai to the Fourth District General Office. After Xu complained about the previous situation, she questioned Liao, who confessed that Dai was born beautiful and she was willing to live with him. Dai also confessed that he was twenty-six years old and that the affair with her was her own free will. The verdict was given as 간통, and they were sent to the Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Restrictions on Building Material Sheds for Living</h3>
<p>Provisional Measures Established</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government strictly prohibited the construction of thatched sheds, ordinary people have often built material sheds in name only for residential purposes. The Public Works Bureau, noting the increasing number of these material sheds scattered throughout the city, which not only detract from the appearance of the city but also easily lead to fires, believes that strict measures are necessary for rectification. However, in consideration of the hardships faced by the people before widespread construction of affordable housing in various districts, it has been decided to allow ordinary people to build sheds for residential purposes in the less developed areas of the South Shanghai District, Zhabei District, and Yinxiang District. In other areas, it is strictly prohibited, demonstrating a restriction. The provisional measures for restricting and dismantling material sheds have been submitted to and approved by the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Inexpensive German Copier</h3>
<p>Since the advent of the German (Multi Kopy) suitcase copier,</p>
<p>it has shone brightly in the copier world. With existing copiers, a single sheet of stencil paper can only print two or three hundred copies before becoming blurry. This machine can print 20,000 copies without leaking ink. Its efficiency is more than a hundred times higher. The clarity of the print and the non-greasy nature of the ink, along with its portability, make it superior to ordinary equipment. The original price was thirty yuan per unit, but now, by ordering more from the manufacturer, the cost has been reduced. At a time when gold prices are soaring, the price has been reduced to twenty-four yuan, making it a rare opportunity for buyers. The stencils, steel plates, and ink used in this machine can also be sold retail and used in other machines to improve their performance. The China agent is the Commercial Press.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Horse (mocking the car) — You are a dead thing. You can only move by eating oil. Without oil, you are dead. What is so rare about that?</p>
<p>Car — Your belly is filled with grass. And you can only carry one person on your back. I can carry three, four, five, or six people without them complaining. What is so rare about you?</p>
<p>Man — My love, you are unwilling to marry me. Then do you not love me?</p>
<p>Woman Worker — No. I still love you. I am one year older than you. I am like your older sister. From now on, we will be like siblings.</p>

<h3>Novel Prize Method in the Philippine Chinese Conference</h3>
<p>— Yan Wenchou</p>
<p>During the opening of the Chinese conference, large companies always use a shopping voucher method. After the closing ceremony, a lottery is drawn to award prizes.</p>
<p>This is a plan to promote business, but winning prizes by luck is a gambling activity. This is strictly prohibited by the laws of this place. It is necessary to compete with intelligence and thought. It is also an interesting event in a lively occasion.</p>
<p>First, there were two English newspapers run by Filipinos in Manila. One was the Herald, and the other was the Tribune, which competed to promote sales. The Tribune partnered with an insurance company. Anyone who subscribed to the newspaper for three months of the year would receive an insurance policy from a certain company. During this year, if they were injured in the streets by a car or carriage, they could receive an insurance payment of one thousand yuan. The newspaper's sales increased greatly among the working class at the time. As this Chinese conference was about to open, the Herald joined forces with sixteen companies (the Chinese-Philippine New Min Daily News also joined) to invest forty thousand yuan. They set up the world's nine great figures as the target, namely Thomas Edison of the United States, Madame Curie of France, Benito Mussolini of Italy, Chiang Kai-shek of China, George of England, Miguel Primo de Rivera of Spain, Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines, Nishi Mikado of Japan, and Paul von Hindenburg of Germany. Anyone who purchased a month's worth of newspapers or purchased one yuan's worth of goods from each company would receive a voucher. The names of these nine great figures are printed on the voucher. Participants must rank these nine figures in order of their own fair criticism (i.e., list the numbers 1, 2, and 3 next to the names of these nine people). From the opening of the Chinese conference at eight o'clock in the morning on the 16th, vouchers could be submitted to a specially designated ticket counter. (The ticket collector stamps the ticket with the date and time of receipt.) The participating companies hired three famous figures from the academic community in advance to jointly propose the order of these nine great figures. The order was sealed in nine iron cabinets. After the closing of the Chinese conference, the tickets were opened. Those whose proposed order was the same as that of the judges would receive the first prize, or be ranked as the second or third prize winners depending on the time of submission. (Gratitude)</p>
<h3>The Story of a Madman Biting a Dog</h3>
<p>— Fang Fei</p>
<p>A mad dog biting a person can lead to death. The world views it as a terrifying event. Recently, a relative from Xixing came and recounted a news story that happened there last year about a madman biting a dog. Recounting it is quite amusing. Previously, in that village, there was a Yang family that made a fortune by raising silkworms. The four brothers all had no children. Only the second brother had adopted a child early on. Everyone considered him to be the only heir. The child was also very intelligent. He had studied at a school in Anhui. His studies were remarkable. Two years ago, he suddenly fell into the water and drowned while riding a bicycle. His father was deeply saddened by this. He was depressed all day. When he saw people, he cried and claimed that the Yang family had no descendants. Some people advised him to adopt another child and cultivate him. How could he know that the child would not be as good as the previous one? Yang said that heaven would not grant the Yang family an heir. Even if there were a hundred adopted children, they could not be relied upon. Those who heard this laughed at his pedantry. He accumulated resentment for a long time. Yang's nerves gradually showed abnormal signs. After a month, he became a madman. He cried, fought, and had no rationality all day. His family locked him in a back room and did not allow him to go out. After a few days, his mental state recovered somewhat. He begged to be allowed to go out for a walk. So, two strong men accompanied him to stroll around the village. On the way, a village dog barked madly at him. Yang suddenly jumped forward, grabbed the dog's neck, and hugged it tightly. He suddenly bit the dog's nose with his mouth. The dog howled loudly. The strong men rushed forward to rescue it. Yang then threw the dog away, crying loudly, saying, "It's like seeing my son come. So, I hugged him and kissed his cheek. How could he turn into a dog?" The villagers knew that his madness had recurred. They locked him in the original room again. He died soon after. The dog did not suffer serious injuries. It was treated with medicine and did not die. However, the area around its nose now has a very deep bite mark. It looks like it was born with it. When people see it, it is no longer as brave and good at barking as before. It seems to be afraid of something.</p>
<h3>Newly Popular Parrot Disease</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Recently, a strange disease has become newly popular in European countries. The disease is called parrot fever. Many newspapers in our country have also reported on it, but they are brief and lack detail. Now, I have found a Western magazine and translated some excerpts to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Origin of the Disease The first patient to develop parrot fever was Thomas, a pharmacist from Stanforth Nye. When the disease was severe, a medical consultation was held, but the cause could not be determined for a long time. Later, he was asked if he kept a parrot, and it became clear that the disease was transmitted by the bird. Therefore, the name parrot fever became a sensation for a time.</p>
<p>Spread of the Disease Now, parrots have been imported from the South Sea Islands into Berlin, Germany. According to reports from various places, the transmission is very severe. Three people have died. It has been confirmed that they suffered from parrot fever. Therefore, the authorities must strictly inspect imported parrots. When necessary, they are strictly prohibited from landing. Households that keep parrots are also instructed not to come into contact with them.</p>
<p>Symptoms Parrots suffer from epidemic fever, which can be transmitted to humans. When it occurs, the lungs become inflamed and the body temperature increases abnormally. However, there is no need for people to protect each other from infection.</p>
<p>Previous Records Examining previous history, only three people in England had died from parrot fever by 1927. Also, in 1892, 500 parrots were imported into Paris. Among them, 300 died of illness one after another. As a result, 46 people were infected at the same time. As many as 16 people died.</p>
<h3>Kite Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Spring is just beginning. Tender willows are spreading green. It's time to fly kites. Kites are also known as paper eagles or kites. They have a long history. Chengzhai Miscellany says that Han Xin used a kite to measure the distance to Weiyang Palace when he was negotiating with Xi. Also, Unique Records says that when Hou Jing was besieging Taicheng, Jianwen made a paper kite and flew it into the air to send an urgent message to the outside. Thus, kites were not just a tool for games. Also, Xun Chu Lu says that Li Ye of the Five Dynasties made kites in the palace, using threads to take advantage of the wind for entertainment. Later, he put a bamboo flute on the kite's head to make the wind enter the bamboo and produce a sound like a zither, hence the name kite. According to this, only those with strings can be called kites. Not ordinary paper kites that are so called.</p>
<p>The form of paper kites. The kite makers often compete to innovate. Some are centipedes, others are butterflies with two wings. Others, such as the soaring peng, the swimming kun, and the beautiful form of the goddess Chang'e, are all vividly displayed in the clouds. It is a spectacle. Japanese people have imitated it as a pair of swallows. The production is even more ingenious. When released, they fly up and down, no less than a pair of swallows welcoming spring.</p>
<p>Flying kites should be done in the suburbs. Otherwise, the power lines are like spider webs, which are easy to disrupt. And violate the police regulations. Those who do this game should know this. Some fly kites at night with lights hanging from the ends of the lines. Bright in the sky, competing with the stars and moon. Added to the strings, the high wind blowing, the charm is cold. Especially the enjoyment of sight and hearing.</p>
<p>People in Gangzhong, on the Double Ninth Festival, often compete to fly kites on Bird Rock Mountain, Yu Mountain, and Ping Mountain. This adds a rhyme to the event of climbing high and inserting dogwood.</p>
<p>Wei Chun Garden was once a famous scenic spot in Shanghai. One spring day, the garden owner launched a kite festival. Chinese and Western people competed to fly. As Yang Yu said, "The neck is tied with a slender ribbon, and the feet follow a long rope," it was a great event for a time. Wu Youru once drew it and put it in the Painting Treasure.</p>
<p>I once had a mis-recorded article about kites, which said that a woman from Zhao Prefecture liked to fly kites. One day, it fell into a garden. The daughter of the garden owner, a young woman who loved beautiful things, picked up the kite and knew it belonged to a woman from Zhao Prefecture. She wrote a poem on it and sent it back to her. The woman also wrote a poem in reply and had a servant give it to the young man. The young man was overjoyed. However, the woman had already been promised to someone else. Later, rumors spread. The woman's parents heard about it and blamed her, so she hanged herself. There was nothing else. It was just a mistake of writing. Those who heard about it lamented it. At that time, Zhuang Liumen was talented but frivolous. He had been involved in a lawsuit with the woman's father, so he resented him. He composed a Legend of the Kite Mistake, which was full of slander.</p>
<h3>Interesting History of Yan Jupeng's Record Cutting</h3>
<p>— Mei Hua Guan Zhu</p>
<p>The advantages of Bei Kai records have been widely reported in various newspapers. The following story is about a small anecdote when the famous actor Yan Jupeng cut a record of "Visiting Mother in the Palace."</p>
<p>"Yang YanHui" in the Sitting in the Palace, a slow-tempo Xipi melody, was previously available in records by Lao Tan. However, due to time constraints, it only sang up to "Arriving in Northern Territory." The six sentences from "I want to go to the camp to see my mother" to "Mothers and sons will meet and reunite in dreams" were omitted. Those who bought the record regretted not being able to see the whole picture. When Bei Kai was recording, he spent a long time researching this play. Everyone agreed that only Yan Jupeng could inherit Lao Tan's mantle. Therefore, it was decided to invite Jupeng to record this play to make up for Lao Tan's shortcomings. Unexpectedly, Jupeng refused to try it easily, because there was jade in front of him. When asked why, he said, "How dare I wield a pen in front of Confucius?" Moreover, there are many knowledgeable people who know this play. The slightest flaw can be criticized. If I brazenly record it, those who don't know the story will laugh at me for being bold and reckless and accuse me of being a criminal of Tan." After saying this, he bowed deeply and declined repeatedly. Because he was determined, I did not force him. The next day, when we met, Jupeng seemed to have changed his mind. However, I had to declare in the newspaper that it was a passive act. I said, "What's so difficult about that? I will obey your orders in the future." Only then did the complete Sitting in the Palace finally succeed. Those who know the process often joked about Yan Jupeng being raped by the owner of the Plum Blossom Hall. (It is said that this record has been released and the results are excellent. Public opinion is also very good. Everyone said that Jupeng's tone is very much like Lao Tan's. This record will definitely win good reputation.)</p>

<h3>Heart's Warmth (137)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Famous Scholars Make Merry Playing Hide-and-Seek, A Charming Woman Indulges in Protecting Them</p>
<p>Ever since this chapter, after Zuo Shichen treated guests at the Mingjing Club, whenever there were social engagements, whether it was enjoying floral wine or dining at restaurants, whenever friends suggested outings, Zuo Shichen would always call for Ruiyun's attendance. He had always been indifferent to such gatherings, but now, seeing that others weren't proposing them, he couldn't help but initiate them himself. When it came to dining out, he initially hoped others would suggest calling for a singing girl. As soon as someone mentioned it, he would eagerly say, "Let me write the invitation!" If no one responded, he would suggest, "Why not call a few singing girls to liven things up?" He often said this. When people got excited, he would then write Rui's singing girl's name. If he was invited to a floral wine party, he wasn't very good at playing cards. Watching others play, he'd say, "Let's call a singing girl to relieve the boredom." Without realizing it, he'd reach into the fruit plate, take a chit, write Ruiyun's name, and have the room attendant send it out. After Ruiyun arrived, he used to feel like there was nothing to talk about, but now it seemed like there were many things to say out of nowhere. In reality, they were all irrelevant. For example, he might say, "Today, I saw a madwoman on the street." Zuo Shichen would then ask, "Is she a man or a woman?" She'd say, "It's a woman. People say she's a love-struck madwoman, very young, only in her twenties. Some say she's sick with lovesickness." Then they'd ask, "Why is she called a love-struck madwoman?" And so, the questions and the conversation would begin. Or, she might say, "Last night, our neighbor in business died—a helper. They say it was acute dysentery. He was dead in less than twelve hours." Then she would ask why he died so quickly and whether there were ghosts after death. Zuo Shichen would laugh and say, "I haven't died before, how would I know?" She'd say, "You've read books. Surely the books have something to say about it." A moment later, she would say, "My great aunt says she's seen ghosts. Ghosts exist!" Such conversations, though irrelevant, pleased Zuo Shichen because of her naive and earnest demeanor, and the way she gestured while speaking. He deliberately teased her into talking. However, others saw them whispering sweet nothings, heads close together, not knowing what they were saying. In reality, they were talking about other people's affairs. A fifteen-year-old girl didn't really know much about love. She longed to play, but her profession and her life didn't allow her any leisure time. Since she had hung up her nameplate and started as a singing girl, every day as soon as the electric lights came on, she would be dressed up, sitting in a rented car, running from one singing hall to another, from one restaurant to another, until after midnight, when her day's work was finally done. Because there were many singing engagements, there were often thirty or forty a day. At night, she would be extremely tired. As soon as her head hit the pillow, she would fall asleep.</p>
<p>And so it would be again the next night.</p>

<h3>Brief Record of February Yarn Delivery</h3>
<p>The February yarn auction occurred at the beginning of the month, coinciding with the Lunar New Year, when gold prices surged, greatly stimulating public sentiment. As a result, retail investors rushed to short sell, and a major yarn factory firm persisted in not selling, resulting in an extremely firm situation, reaching a maximum of 166 taels and 6 qian. With the start of trading after the New Year, American cotton prices plummeted by more than 100 pound coins, and factory inventories increased daily, resulting in a sharp decline. Afterwards, around the 20th, overseas cotton yarn consistently continued to fall. The situation in the North was unsettled, and business on the Yangtze River stalled. Furthermore, due to poor harvests last year, many cloth factories in inland areas stopped production, and sales were completely cut off. The market situation increasingly trended downward. Although a certain yarn factory strongly tightened the market, it was to no avail. The minimum price reached 154 taels and 7 qian. The resulting delivery price was 156 taels, with a total value of 1,271,400 taels. 750 bales were self-delivered, and 7,400 bales were actually delivered, totaling 8,150 bales, including 2,400 bales of 20-count Five Fortunes, 2,300 bales of Shepherd, 850 bales of 16-count Globe, 300 bales of 10-count Three Sheep, 200 bales of Sailboat, 200 bales of Hongfu, 50 bales of Red Lotus Bee, 250 bales of Double Happiness, and 50 bales of Globe. Hengda and Tianlong received the most goods, and Yicheng and Tiancheng delivered the most goods. The brokers and amounts for both receiving and delivering parties are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Process of February Han Cotton Delivery</h3>
<p>Delivery Price: 35 Taels...Amount Reached 3,200 Dan</p>
<p>In the previous two months, the February Han cotton price increased due to skyrocketing gold prices and a lack of sources in Han. The market price was higher than in Shanghai, and public sentiment trended firm, with Han merchants buying in large amounts. The market sentiment was extremely firm, reaching a maximum of 36 taels and 23 qian. With the start of trading after the New Year, the price suddenly fell by 7 or 8 qian due to a plunge of more than 100 pound coins in American cotton prices, and public sentiment panicked, with many selling. However, strong parties remained firm and refused to release the market. Afterwards, due to the low price of cotton and special accommodation from foreign firms to sell at reduced prices, factory purchases increased daily, reaching a minimum of 34 taels. Towards the end of the month, due to a lack of deliverers, buyers did not let go, and the price rebounded to 35 taels and 4 qian. The resulting delivery price was 35 taels, with a total value of 111,000 taels. The total number of deliveries was 3,200 dan. Hengda received 1,000 dan, and only Shenchang delivered 600 dan. The brand numbers and amounts for the brokers of both receiving and delivering parties are listed below:</p>

<h3>糧食米市銷活續堅</h3>
<p>The rice market sales continued to be strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, boats arriving at Zhabei were received, and market sales remained active. Changzhou, Wuxi, and Northern Japonica rice from Jiangsu were purchased and sold by merchants, with high-quality goods stabilizing, mid-grade rice continuing to be firm, and prices fluctuating by only half a cent per unit. However, the selling prices of retail sellers varied, due to different levels of interest from buyers. The movement of ordinary early rice was slightly brisk, with continuous arrivals, making it difficult for prices to rise; they barely maintained their original levels. The supply of high-quality Yangxian rice was not strong, demand was very high, and prices were slightly tight. Mid- to lower-grade rice was affected by large-scale price manipulations, leading to sluggish sales and flat prices. Loose transactions of Duzi Xian and Ke Bu Xian rice were active, and after prices softened, buyer sentiment improved, leading to a price increase of half a cent. Direct sales of Baiyuan rice were not as smooth as those in Southern Shanghai, leading to sluggish prices. Additionally, with thick inventories remaining, there was no possibility of a turnaround for the time being.</p>
<p>Around twenty boats carrying rice arrived in Southern Shanghai in the morning. Changzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other Japonica rice varieties were purchased by customers from villages, Chongming, and Nantong, leading to smooth sales and a price increase of half a cent. However, transactions of this type of rice were small. Demand for early rice from the Southern gangs of Qingpu, Jinze, and Lianfeng was sluggish, and with ample supply and sufficient inventory, prices were flat and weak. The price of extra-high-quality rice had already fallen below 16 yuan. There was continued buying interest for Yangxian and Duzi Xian rice from other regions, and market momentum was lively. Due to poor conditions in Saigon, overall prices only increased slightly by one Chinese foot. The price of top-grade Xian rice was around 16.5 yuan. Transactions were changing; arrivals and sales were both competitive. Buyers still selected high-quality rice for purchase, and market conditions were firm.</p>
<h3>麵粉又被金價提高</h3>
<p>Flour Prices Further Increased by Gold Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months suddenly saw a rapid increase, as the price of foreign wheat had already risen by a significant amount, and the high price of gold had reappeared. With the market value of 500 taels from beyond the customs and exchange rates necessarily shrinking, this phenomenon would inevitably create hidden obstacles when approaching foreign flour and wheat. Although it was impossible to predict how the situation would develop, those who were bullish were excited, leading to brisk buying in both the morning and afternoon markets. Temporary speculation led to aggressive buying. Apart from the current month, where the increase was slight due to the imminent end of the month, future months saw significant gains, partly due to a rebound after a sharp fall, and partly due to overseas price quotations. However, an overpricing in the market could easily lead to a severe decline, and those who were bullish should consider carefully. As a result, the current month increased by 1.75 cents, March increased by 2.75 cents, April increased by 3 cents, May increased by 2.75 cents, June increased by 0.5 cents, and July increased by 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3>期麥疲後之大反動</h3>
<p>A Major Rebound After Weakness in Wheat Futures</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months saw a fierce rebound. With the rise in foreign wheat prices and the flour market also rising, the near-term months saw a great shock in confidence and very eager buying. This state was due to the previous days' overdone decline, leading to a very strong rebound upon any opportunity. As a result, March increased by 6 cents compared to the previous day, and July increased by a substantial 7 cents. Although sentiment was good for the new wheat in June and July, the increase was still flat, with June increasing by only 2 cents and July by 1 cent. The current wheat market price was still stable, as the standard, although showing a rebound, was only around 5.05 taels. Therefore, high-quality goods of all grades were similar to the standard, while mid-grade goods entered the 5.1 tael range. Prices opened at 5.06 taels for Suqian wheat, 5.05 taels for Yaowan wheat, 5.04 taels for Qingjiangpu wheat, 5.01 taels for Mingguang wheat, and 4.99 taels for Yangzhou wheat, with a total of over 2,000 packages.</p>
<h3>糖市日車糖趨勢步升</h3>
<p>The Trend of Japanese Sugar in the Sugar Market is Gradually Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market telegrams from producing regions showed that Cuban raw sugar was still priced at $2.00, New York sugar futures for March were $1.60, down 4 cents from the previous telegram, May was $1.67, down 7 cents, September was $1.83, down 6 cents, and December was $1.93, also down 5 cents. Both Javanese raw sugar and March futures were priced at 10.5, with April at 10.625, each down 0.125. The guild market drew up a disk, and with the strengthening of the Dutch exchange rate, the atmosphere for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar became increasingly strong. Although the Dutch market reported declines, the high cost basis was not greatly affected, and the transaction price remained at 7.1 taels. However, there was a severe lack of supply, and the asking price was 7.15 taels. Although there were no transactions, the market outlook was very good. Fine ground white sugar was priced at 7.15 to 7.75 taels, and No. 20 medium ground white sugar was priced at 6.85 taels, with few transactions, and the market appeared stable. The trend of Japanese sugar was strong, with N mark at 7.575 to 7.6 taels, YT at 7.475 taels, YP at 7.65 taels, SE mark at 7.5 taels, and I mark at 7.85 to 7.75 taels. Market conditions were all lively.</p>
<h3>疋頭色子貢走銷頗暢</h3>
<p>Sales of Piece Goods and Colored Zigung Silk are Quite Brisk</p>
<p>Since rumors about the current situation emerged, the piece goods market gradually declined, with a tendency to become depressed. Yesterday, however, it began to recover, mainly because the gold market had seen a strong rise in recent days, driving up costs, leading to a slightly firmer attitude among merchants. Yesterday, First Grade Tribute Satin and 6-pound Guo Ju Hongbiao, and other eastern goods all rose by 0.025 to 0.025 taels. However, actual sales were affected by the uncertain situation, and merchants from Sichuan have yet to take action. However, 100+ shipments were sent by merchants from Hubei, mostly Fushou bleached cloth, priced at 8.4 taels. Merchants from Jiangxi and Changsha were also relatively active, while others were uninspired. Transactions in the local market were mostly for patterned goods, while the sale of common goods was very quiet. Newly arrived three-color Zigung wool was selling quite briskly, with Ronghua Fugui priced at 0.23 taels, Yuhuayuan at 0.225 taels, and blue-striped satin also seeing additional purchases. Ersunfu Zijinshan new stripes were all priced at 0.17 taels, Hanshansi Zijinshan at 0.1675 taels, and Kewei Meiren at 0.165 taels. Western plain silk saw a slight increase yesterday, as arrivals this year were quite limited, and those holding goods had high hopes. Yiji Shuanghudie and Luoshili Shimeitu were priced at 0.485 taels per French foot.</p>
<h3>五金各貨價隨滙率趨高</h3>
<p>Prices of Metals and Various Goods Trended Higher with Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Yesterday, with the exchange rate gradually tightening, the cost of metals and various goods increased invisibly, leading to a price increase of several cents for various goods opening in the market compared to the previous day. For example, English and American tinplate opened at 10.065 taels (90-pound English goods) and 11.4 taels (100-pound English goods). American 90-pound goods were estimated at 11.75 taels, and 100-pound goods at 12.5 taels. No. 24 galvanized iron sheet was priced at 10.05 taels, No. 26 at 11.75 taels, and No. 28 at 12.25 taels. 0.0025-inch English steel plate was priced at 8.75 taels, 0.005-inch at 6.15 taels, 0.0075-inch at 6.51 taels, 6.1 taels, 18-gauge black iron sheet at 8.75 taels, 13-gauge at 9.25 taels, and 1 to 6-inch round nails at 6.75 taels. Other metal products also rose by several cents, but due to the rapid rise in prices, transactions were limited.</p>
<h3>絲茶白廠經英法續有需要</h3>
<p>Silk and Tea White Factory Silk Continued to be Needed in England and France</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of Japanese foreign firms remained strong. Inquiries showed that there was continued demand for Shanghai white factory silk in London and Lyon. There were continuous telegrams yesterday morning, but due to the shrinking exchange rate and limited Shanghai stocks, transactions were difficult and prices were also weak. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and others imported 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, Syn Chong imported 10 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Cheung Kee imported 8 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices were generally flat.</p>

<h3>Recent Developments in Sports and Exercise in Europe and America</h3>
<p>Women Exercising Nude in Sunlight</p>
<p>According to a certain gentleman returning from Europe and America, sports and exercise in Europe and America have recently become more developed. Germany has a sports league, dividing the country into 17 districts, and each district is divided into 20 to 30 small regions, with the smallest sports organization in the small region as the smallest unit. Its organization is prevalent throughout the country, with most citizens joining, with 5 million members and 2 million associate members, one-fifth of whom are women. A sports commemorative event is held every five years. In recent years, when the meeting was held in Keroth, 500,000 ordinary athletes gathered. The Prussian Sports School in Spander advocates "returning to nature," and women exercise nude in sunlight without being ashamed. The foot exercises extend forward, backward, and upward, like dancing, so that the limbs are stretched and the pelvic bones are strong and easy to produce. The corrective exercises initiated by the Dane P. H. Ling are also popular in Germany. In particular, according to the various machines of the American YMCA, exercising can correct lighter deformities of the human body, such as spinal curvature and left shoulder upward. In schools, etc., school doctors and physical education teachers work together to do this. As for the UK, it is a country of sports. If four or five people gather, they will engage in sports, such as golf, polo, and hunting. Women are also very active. In Italy under Mussolini, the slogan is first sports, second moral education, and third intellectual education. Mussolini himself serves as a role model to encourage them. In the United States, Mrs. Hoover serves as the female minister of the National General Sports Association and vigorously encourages sports.</p>
<h3>Chinese Egg Imports to Japan Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>From 10 Million Yen to 1 Million Yen Annually</p>
<p>Reason: The Japanese Poultry Industry is Developed</p>
<p>Reason: Chinese Eggs are More Expensive</p>
<p>According to Japanese news, Japan's egg production has increased in recent years, and Chinese egg imports have been greatly reduced. Before 1928, the average annual import of Chinese eggs was worth more than 10 million yen. By 1928, it had been reduced to 6.9 million yen, and by 1929, it had been reduced to 3.9 million yen. It is predicted that the value of Chinese eggs imported this year will be less than 1 million yen. Half of the reason is the increase in Japanese egg production, and half is that Chinese eggs are more expensive than Japanese eggs. In recent years, Japan's poultry industry has developed, and egg prices have gradually fallen. All industries that use eggs as raw materials have also switched to using domestically produced Japanese eggs. Since the beginning of this year, few Chinese eggs have arrived in the Kansai market, and no Chinese eggs have been imported into Kanto.</p>
<h3>Chinese Students Enrolling in Japanese Military Academies</h3>

The enrollment period is stipulated to be from April 1 to the end of September. The academic period is from October 1 this year to July 1932.</p>
<h3>A Sharp Increase in Mail During Japanese General Elections</h3>
<p>Post Offices Hire 170,000 Temporary Workers</p>
<p>Tokyo News: During the recent Japanese general election, the amount of mail greatly increased. Post offices temporarily hired 170,000 people, and the Ministry of Communications increased expenditures by 1.8 million. As of the 19th, post offices across the country had received and sent 50 million election letters and postcards. A total of 500,000 people were busy working during the last few hours.</p>
<h3>Polygamy Among Muslims in the Philippines</h3>
<p>To be Abolished in Twenty Years</p>
<p>Manila News: The residents of Mindanao and Sulu Islands in the Philippines are mostly Muslims, who follow the Koran and still practice polygamy. Although American law prohibits it, it has not been effective. Recently, the Philippine Council proposed an amendment to the marriage law, which was approved by Governor Davis and passed by the Council. The content is to gradually abolish polygamy, and completely abolish it after 20 years. Generally, Christians advocate complete abolition immediately, but because Muslims in the Philippines and Moros object, there are fears of armed riots. Therefore, the authorities decided to adopt a gradual approach.</p>

<p>As shown in the table above, compared with the previous year, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Dalian increased in imports, while Hankou and Tianjin decreased. Shanghai and Dalian increased in exports, while Hankou, Qingdao, and Tianjin decreased. Hankou decreased greatly in both imports and exports. The increase in Shanghai was due to the revision of tariffs starting on February 1, and early imports were popular. The increase in Dalian was due to the relationship between China and Russia. The increase in Qingdao was due to the resolution of the Jiaoji Railway issue. The sharp decline in Hankou was due to the war and the interruption of traffic on the Pinghan Railway. The decrease in Tianjin was no more than the impact of the current situation.</p>

<h3>New Year's Eve by Liu Qingqing</h3>
<p>A Letter Sent from a Foreign Country</p>
<p>Dear Elder Sister Shijun,</p>
<p>"The fleeting years do not linger for youth." Truly, I now deeply feel the ruthlessness of time. Last year on New Year's Eve, you were all nestled gently in our loving mother's embrace. I was adrift at sea, and our younger sister was in Hunan Province at the Fourth Middle School. You wrote to tell me that on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, as the maid and sister-in-law filled the round table with New Year's dishes, and everyone gathered to eat the New Year's Eve dinner, Mother, missing her two daughters scattered far and wide, couldn't swallow the delicious food, because her throat was choked with tears. Sister, this very day this year, I am once again driven by life to a lonely foreign land. Our clever and adorable younger sister has been crowned queen of her earthen kingdom by disease and money. Today, I wonder if Mother's tears will be many times more than in previous years.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese still preserve the ancient customs of the old year. On this thirtieth day, just like in China, they habitually eat New Year's Eve dinner, wear new clothes, respect the gods and ancestors, and set off firecrackers as New Year's celebrations. Sister, can you imagine how I feel when I hear these sounds?</p>
<p>Schools in China usually start their New Year holidays half a month in advance, but it's not the same here. Even though today is the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, Huiqing's school hasn't started the holiday. It's because the stubborn principal wants to please those illiterate but wealthy school board members. Having classes on the thirtieth of the twelfth lunar month shows that he is an educator devoted to education. Huiqing went to class, and I went with her. I hid in the deep shade of the schoolyard reading books. She stubbornly stayed in the classroom, holding a teaching whip, touching chalk, raising her voice, and standing on the podium talking tirelessly. Her classes ended at six o'clock, and it was already three in the afternoon. We went back to our dormitory together, hunger driving us to seek food in that low-lying house. Alas, our tin pot, brass stove, porcelain bowls, bone chopsticks, etc., had all been stolen by the runaway maid. Our New Year's Eve dinner naturally became just a painting of a cake. We thought about buying some snacks outside for our New Year's Eve meal. But since we just arrived here, we don't speak the language well, and even saying a single sentence is difficult. Besides knowing the transliteration of "bread" as "lao di er," we don't understand the names of any other food. So, our New Year's Eve dinner will naturally be two loaves of bread.</p>
<p>Around three in the afternoon, some students' families sent some snacks, fruits, and ice soda. Our food for tomorrow, or rather, our food for the coming year, can be considered secured. Although we are very poor and lonely abroad, I always feel like I am happy, because this special kind of life in a foreign country still has some interest.</p>
<p>A noisy sound came from outside, mixed with a sharp and piercing sound. When I went out to take a look, it turned out that the local people were dancing to entertain the capitalists. Two girls, about sixteen years old, had skin like smoked yellow bacon. Their chests and legs were covered with dance costumes woven from coconut tree hair. They wore egg-sized copper earrings and held red veils in their hands. Their dancing was lively and natural. I thought, if these women were in a civilized country and given training, their art might be outstanding and graceful. This kind of dance is something I've seen for the first time in my life. Because today is New Year's, it's a happy day for the rich. For people like us, who haven't had a grain of rice in our stomachs today, feasting our eyes is enough to satisfy us.</p>
<p>Some children on the street, wearing new clothes, were standing outside their doors, playing with firecrackers in their hands. I couldn't help but think of my own childhood. Before New Year's even arrived, my brother had already returned from school. He would write couplets and always ask me to grind ink. At that time, my little hands had so much difficulty grinding a tray of thick ink. So, I made a deal with him: a tray of thick ink for a large string of Liuyang firecrackers. Later, my small wooden bookcase was filled with them. On the night of the thirtieth, Mother dressed me in fancy clothes, hung a snake-like New Year's lucky money made of red rope around my neck, and I also held many firecrackers and incense sticks in my hand, standing in front of the door playing like these children. At that time, I was very happy, so I really looked forward to New Year's. New Year's seems to be the endless hope of children; it is also the sad disappointment of the elderly.</p>
<p>Tonight in China, every family will close their doors and windows, and the whole family will gather around the stove to stay up late, quietly spending a happy New Year. The New Year's situation here is completely different from in China. Although every household's door is decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, some people are wearing silk and satin clothes, holding round fans, and sitting on the brightly lit verandas enjoying the cool air. Everywhere, you can only hear chaotic clamor, noisy drum and gong sounds, and crackling firecrackers. All these sounds mixed together in this hot weather and dry air make it even more unbearable. So, Huiqing and I escaped from this foul air to the park to look for a trace of wind. My eyes completely fell on the dull, standing treetops. The branches and leaves seemed to be sleeping, and the surrounding birds were all quietly silent.</p>
<p>We slowly strolled to the pond. Many men and women, whom my eyes were meeting for the first time, were also sitting here waiting for the wind god to descend. We sat on a long bench on the bridgehead, and the lights on the opposite bank of a large river were reflected in the water, with thousands of rays of golden light. It was truly beautiful.</p>
<p>This New Year's Eve, I found so many treasures of memories and also picked up so many unique tunes from this foreign land. All of this is a seed of memory planted in my heart. I am always afraid that the harvest will be somewhat painful. Younger sister Yueying, sent from a foreign country.</p>
<h3>Marriage and Sorcery of the Maori People of New Zealand's Island</h3>
<p>The Maori people on New Zealand Island, a British colony, are a very unique race. After decades of white people's management, they have not made much progress. They still practice the chieftain system and in many places stand in opposition to the white people.</p>
<p>Recently, C. R. Browne risked writing about the Maori people's sorcery during his confinement among the Maori people in "Maori Witchery." This book is a very interesting book full of barbaric descriptions. Regarding the situation where Moffat was captured and imprisoned by the Maori when the white people wanted to build a railway on the island: "I think their treatment of a prisoner is so kind that it has never been seen in a white people's prison. However, after a few days, some children peeped through the cracks and said to each other, 'Oh, these things are getting fat. Alas, it's time to kill them.' This made me anxiously think about my dangerous position. I decided to try my best to escape.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, I am among those who are going to be killed. I am bound to be killed and eaten by these savage barbarians!"</p>
<p>But he did not escape; instead, he gained freedom and was released. Among these people was the author, Mr. Browne. After being released from prison, he spent a long time with them and married a Maori woman. The woman's name was Te Artu, a beautiful woman from the Maori aristocracy, a relative of Chief Ngatae. The wedding ceremony was very simple. After all the people in the village held a dance, they performed a solemn oath-taking ceremony for the bride and groom.</p>
<p>"There is a very important question to ask you, Para," Chief said. "That is, do you promise to always be faithful to Te Artu? While she lives, you will never have relations with any other woman?"</p>
<p>"I am very happy to allow that, oh, Ngatae," I replied.</p>
<p>Then the chief shouted loudly and clearly, "Oh, people of Tuhva, relatives of my niece, do you want this white Para to be Te Artu's husband?"</p>
<p>They all shouted in unison, "Yes!" Only Tojjhiora, who resembled a high priest among white people, did not express his approval.</p>
<p>In fact, he had a very high position in the Maori tribe. After the chief lectured me and the bride and told us that our marriage was appropriate, the high priest stood up and cursed me, saying that our marriage would not last long and that we would soon die.</p>
<p>Browne said that he never returned to the one he loved. Their home was destroyed, and his bride was killed under the supervision of the sorcery-performing high priest, who considered her unlucky, after her husband was away from home.</p>
