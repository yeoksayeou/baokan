<p>▲蔣主席演説</p>
<p>開會時、蔣主席便服入塲、登主席臺、蔣部長即宣告開會、請國府蔣主席演説演詞如下、</p>
<p>今日余參預二次全敎、非常榮幸、余對於敎育無多大研究不敢向諸君有所貢獻、惟個人近來對於國内敎育、有許多感想、爰爲諸君一述之、</p>
<p>（一）國民革命之工作、尙未完成、其最大基礎、實爲敎育、如此種基礎不固、危險實甚、故對於中國敎育、亟宜改革完善、以期一般靑年站於三民主義之下、而共同努力、今日國内有許多不良潮流、端賴吾人以革命手段、從事改革、自五四運動以來、革命同志、多注意於破壞、而不及建設、此因時間關係、而不擇手段、誠有不得已之苦衷、當今時代、雖破壞之時期已過、然國内學風、仍爲不良、此則今日敎育之果、不良不可謂非昔日所種之果、因國民革命、必能成功、在革命過程中、如何實施、建設敎育、煞可研究、今時何時、破壞之時已過、如重行破壞性質之敎育、則必失敗、建設性質之敎育、須以有秩序爲先决條件、總理在民二十四年北上時、向黄埔學生演説、講演有二小時、其大意以爲黨員無自由、學生無自由、故總理絶對不主張學生有自由、余以爲中國今日之一切不良情形、不得不歸咎於學生之太自由、敎育成效非一日所可見也、十年二十年後、始可見之、中國古語有云、十年樹木、百年樹人、洵爲名言、今日之敎育、應負民族存亡之責任、故各大學校長、及各省敎廳長、肩負甚鉅、直接間接關係於國家之存亡危急、吾人必須負此責任、以從事敎育、着手方法、首在整頓學風、使從前之浪漫紊亂現象、一掃而空、俾國家之百年大計、得以確定、敎育定如能切實整頓學風、雖有若何阻力、及黨部政府、無論如何、必爲之後盾、雖犧牲性命、亦所不惜、不如是則中國學風永無整頓之一日、希望各省敎育當局、多多注意、此種以革命精神、而振起中國民族精神、整頓中國今日學風、</p>
<p>（二）中國爲經濟落後之國家、萬不能效輩外邦、宜創獨立性之敎育、以適今國情、中國爲農業國家、故農業敎育、實爲救國根本要圖、且比任何敎育爲重要、我人不應視以農立國爲老生常談、余意農業敎育、無論如何、也須提倡、能如實現、則五年十年以後、也有成效、惟農業敎育、能救吾中國國家、能實現民生主義、其功效當在工業敎育商業敎育之上、</p>
<p>（三）靑年思想、也須統一、故對於黨義敎育、亟宜重視、各級學校校長、如能担負黨義敎科以指導靑年思想、實爲良好辦法、因校長爲一校之信仰人物、吾人欲求政治安定、思想安定、也須賴三民主義以統一之、各省敎育廳長之考察敎育、尤須注意於各校實施黨義敎育之如何、不特余個人所望如是、即本黨同志亦深盼若是、</p>
<p>▲會議實施義務敎育初步計劃</p>
<p>休息十分鐘後、搖鈴開會、蔣議長宣讀本計劃修正原文之第十條目標、請會員討論、（一）朱經農首先謂、改正文字、比原文範圍爲廣、故比較完善、（二）莊澤宣發言、謂此次行列、爲正式辦法、所有酌量變通之字様宜取消、（三）朱經農繼謂、變通二字、使鄕村學校之放假、及兒童缺課時補足學業等活動辦法（四）張鴻烈一謂、縮短與變動非事一、須注意、（五）彭清鵬提議、修正案中、再宜修正、刪去「酌量縮短式」得許季茀之附議、成立議案、（六）廖世承謂、變通兩字、仍可通用、因便於兒童之求學實際情形、（七）趙迺傅謂、原修正案無大問題、縮短二字、可改延展、（八）李權時謂、縮短二字取消、用酌量變通、在學期間、付表决時、贊成對於審查會修改及會員提議者、「但對於不能繼續在學四年之兒童、得酌量變通之、」以多數通過、</p>

<p>▲義務敎育組審查報告</p>
<p>本組由主席張鴻烈報告前日經過情形、並審查結果、共修改三處、茲將修正之文錄如下列、</p>
<p>（一）目標　本計畫的目標、在使全國學齡兒童得受初級小學四年的敎育、但對於不能繼續、在學四年之兒童、得酌量變通、（註一）、或縮短、（註二）、他們在學期間、而用補習學校、（註三）、或有「自修制度、」（註四）、補足他們應受的義務敎育、</p>
<p>（二）期限　擬在五年裏完成全國訓練師資的機關、並且在同時期内開辦城市及鄕村義務敎育實騐區各一千五百處、（註五）、使全國各重要縣分、對於義務敎育、都可以開始作小規模的試騐、以後逐年推廣第二十年末、但各省市敎育行政長官、得酌量地方情形、縮短期限、提前完成此項工作、</p>
<p>副議長陳和銑　光華攝</p>
<p>陸殿揚提議、如二十年時期、改爲十年、則師資及經費、將發生問題、且與預算規劃不能符合、故宜維持原案、下添（各省市敎育行政長官）得酌量地方情形、提早實施義務敎育、）得胡庶華附議、議案成立、俞子夷謂、義敎如改爲十年、經費預算、每年須加負擔、對於國民經濟、須發生問題、故宜維持計劃原案、而加陸殿陽氏修正之意、尤須注意在地方富力、衛挺生謂、今日國民經濟力已較前提高、故經費問題、或不發生困難、本席以爲師資問題、恐較爲困難、其邊遠地方、造就師資、實爲不易舉行之事、故解决師資、非五六年所可完事、故仍贊成陸殿揚先生所提議之酌量地方情形、不必提出師資及富力、陸殿揚繼謂提議之動機、因有鑒於審查組之修正、關於提早一事、認爲因難、故王張維原案、表决贊成原案者多數、通過、</p>

<p>黄建中謂修正案、（遇必要時得延長至十五歲）、可不必加入宜刪去、陳劍　謂註六修正文、與註二原文衝突、故宜維持原案、付表决時贊成維持計劃原文者多數、通過、蔣議長問本案是否作爲全部通過、孟憲承謂本問題有關師資問題者、尙未討論、故未能認爲全部通過、朱經農提議、謂本案宜保留師資訓練經費預算二點、餘作爲通過付表决時、贊成朱經農之提議者多數、通過、　　河南敎育廳長張鴻烈　光華攝</p>

<p>▲河南敎育廳長張鴻烈</p>
<p>烈對於河南敎育、本擬作一很詳細的計劃、以求諸敎育家指正、奈政變偬促、均未脱稿、實爲遺恨、茲將簡明大意、略爲説明、</p>
<p>（一）高等敎育、河南中山大學自民十六以來、開文理農法醫五科、五科學生額數至九百餘人、經費至三十七萬元、量的上可謂長足發展、但設備經費敎授、均不足以濟其窮、擬於今年秋季、停招預科、縮少科目、集中經費、在質上着手、方可名稱其實、</p>
<p>（二）中等敎育、河南中等敎育、有省立初中十四、高中一、男師範五、女師範二、女中一、職業學校四、其餘縣立初中約四十餘處、因迭遭變亂、内容均不充實、擬於三年内、以全力整理中學内部、增加經費、添置校舍圖書儀器等及其他設備、並提高敎員待遇、集中敎師人才、俟整理計劃完成後、再行擴充、</p>
<p>（三）初等敎育、對於河南初等敎育、整理與擴充、應同時並行、換言之、就是一方面整理縣市立小學校、一方面訓練師資、增加欵項、於一年後、逐漸擴充、以完成普及敎育爲宗旨、</p>
<p>（四）成年補習敎育、對於成年失學人民、本擬於六年内均得受補習學校敎育、故已由省設立民衆師範學校、民衆實騐校、以培養師資、各機關各學校均附設民衆學校及職業訓練班、爲初步計劃、於鄕村各小學敎室内每晚均有民衆補習班、各村公共埸所均設民衆學校、爲二步計劃、調查各地失學成人數目、詳細統計、分期補習、若六年内、地方仍有未受補習敎育者、辦理人及不受敎育人均加以相當處罰、六年後、民衆均能行使職權、俾便進行訓政時期一切工作、爲最終計劃、</p>
<p>（五）社會敎育、敎育廳已設有社會敎育推廣部、總管全省社會敎育、各縣已設立社會敎育講演處、總管全縣社會敎育、刻已由省設立民衆博物館、藝術學院、體育塲、圖書館、巡環圖書館、成年民衆及農工商補習學校等、各縣亦均已次第設立、俟地方平靖、再加以擴充、並擬在各縣均設一社會敎育機關、研究實施良法、及訓練實審人才、俾完成社會敎育使命、</p>
<p>以上所述、均簡略言之、俟詳細計劃印出後、再爲分送、（十九·四·十五·於首都、）</p>

<p>▲理由</p>
<p>一·德國中學九年、學生畢業年齡爲十八歲、法國中學前期四年、後期三年、畢業年齡亦爲十七八歲、美國中學行三三制、畢業年齡十八歲、日本中學昔爲五年制、因敎學改良、程度提高、已改爲四年、合高等學校三年、共七年、畢業年齡、則在二十左右、德法中學本部之下、有預備班修業年期一爲三年、一爲四年、美與日本、則由小學階梯而升、小學大都六年、我國仿行六三三制、合中小學計之、共十二年、畢業年齡、亦爲十八歲、學各國相髣、且短於日本之學校年齡矣、以吾國中學課程論、則本國文字·黨義·本國史地·社會常識·國學常識、其關於本國文化上之關係、自較他國課程爲繁重、更須修習外國語·世界常識·各種普通科學、以及職業技能、其支配之困難、與學生負担之疲勞、可母待言、乃欲與歐美中學、齊其修學年限、不免生呑活剝之弊、中學程度、不能提高、則大學敎育、亦未由進步、除設法改良敎學外、必須延長一年者、因課程繁重、必須修習故也、</p>
<p>二·課程支配、在初中方面最感困難、自十一年新學制頒布後、三三制與四二制之爭、至今未息、即前大學院公布之中學條例、亦以三三制與四二制並列、現查敎育部所定初中課程標準、共計一百八十學分、平均每學期有三十學分之多、於兒童了解融化之能力、恐不相適、且其中史地只十二學分、自然科十五學分、包括地質鑛物氣象大意、恐於實際敎學諸多扦格、假使初中専爲升學預備、財高初中自可立一六年一貫之　　無如初中自成一段落、則現代世界文化要素、及普通科學之敎材、又不能不自成一圓周、而此圓周内容、乃極稀薄、轉令高中程度有低降之虞、其問題一也、且理論上規定授課一小時、自修一小時者爲一學分、實際則學生對於基本學科之熟練、每至預備二三小時、而對於他學科、不免顧此失彼、其問題二也、小學純用國語、初中則須了解文言、能作文言、將來升學及應用、尤不能盡廢文言、因此小學與初中之間、已發生裂　、而初中國文敎學、較前有雙重之困難、竊考德法兩國中學學齡提早、要在基本敎科、語文訓練、與尋常小學不同、此係雙軌學制、殊與現代平民化趨勢相背馳、吾國初中倘能將預備升學者、與預備職業者、分組訓練、自是甚善、惟查敎部所定課程標準、職業學程、只有五學分至十五學分、欲收實際應用之效、蓋亦難矣、其問題三也、照以上所述各種困難、尤非加增年限不可、　　三·自十一年新學制頒布後、各處四年制之中學、均躍然欲辦高中一如高専改大之狂熱、而不量經濟如何、設備如何、敎員資格如何、馴至學校内容、空無所有、敎學程度、未嘗提高、不如切切實實辦一四年之中學、然行三三制後、欲令减短一年、改辦初中、則莫不垂頭喪氣、地方人士、亦以改升高中爲榮、相與鼓吹、而不量學生之能入高中者有幾何、於是多設高中、敎育效率、因分而薄、亦一極有研究價值之問題也、苟採用四三制、由敎部派員會同敎育廳、調查各省中學所在區域之敎育狀况、學校成績、學生數、校舍設備、敎員學歷經騐著作等等、一一定出標準、各省劃定高級中學區、歸併者歸併、應添者添設、如是集中訓練、敎育效率、不難增高也、</p>
<p>四·初中宜普遍、高中主選拔、或以爲延長一年之後、恐受敎育經濟力不能負担、此可以獎學金解决之、若如今日之制度、即初中已有宮牆萬仞之嘆、何况高中、且初中之設、其理論有屬於心理方面者、有屬於社會方面者、言之甚長、而試探個性、設施職業訓練、其要論也、苟加增一年、則職業訓練、自不患其年幼、可多與以熟練之、會、出而應用、技能旣較增進、責任觀念、亦加豐厚、且現當義務敎育推行之始、即江蘇一省第機一年約缺敎師一萬四千人、初中三年生、如志願爲敎師、即可選修敎育學程、四年下期、分配實習、可以補充敎師之缺乏焉、自前初中畢業生、除升學外、多在家閒居、皇皇無所之、豈非敎育上社會上之大憂乎、（高中畢業不升學者尙易設法）</p>
<p>五·據蘇省各中學之經騐、初中畢業升學者、約占百分之八十以上、而升入高中後一年内退學者甚多、則初中加增一年、充實普通學科及加增職業訓練、亦爲適應社會之需要、而高中不發逹省分、有四年之初級中學、亦可提高敎育程度焉據上所述中學改行四三制後、約有數利、（一）課程易於支配、（二）職業訓練易於實施、（三）高中可以集中辦理、增進效率（四）大學程度、因之提高、是否有當、願與敎育家一商榷之、</p>

<h3 id="c110">對第二次全敎會的一點希望·馬·鶴·天 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>第二次全國敎育會議開幕了、這次特别的地方、</p>
<p>即開幕時蔣部長所説的、（一）是預由専家擬定了整個的有系統的改進全國敎育方案、計畫二十年、免得零星的紛亂的、各就主觀所見、不分緩急的提案、（二）是會員中規定有各縣市敎育行政人員、每省一人、知道各地方的實際情形、這實在是本次會議較第一次會議的優點、、</p>
<p>但我還有一點懐疑（一）是中國幅員太大、各地方的文化程度、經濟狀况、以及種種特殊情形、懸絶太甚、是不是統一的一致的方案所能適合、（二）計畫須根據事實、即根據各地的調查統計、我國各地情形、過於複雜、一切調查統計的材料、有許多地方、絶對没有、一部份有的、也不確實、以不確實的根據、或無根據的計畫、是否適合實際狀况、能否見諸實行、且以目下情形、各地差不多年年有劇烈的不規則變化、二十年計畫、是否有一錯全盤皆錯的可慮、（三）此次各縣市敎育行政人員、實際出席的有十分之幾、眞正求自民問的又有幾分之幾、且各地情形懸殊、是否一人所能代表、結果是不是對各地實情、依然隔閡、所以我希望這次會議、對各項計畫、種種辦法、應顧慮到各地方的特殊情形、使有可伸縮的彈性、於整個之中、留活動變通的地步、讓實際擔任各個地方敎育行政的人員、得按環境爲適合的實施、庶乎計畫不背事實、不至如第一次會議結果的「束之高閣」、</p>
<h3 id="c111">對於敎育方案中改進初步敎育計劃的感想　冬靑 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>初等敎育、大部份是各市縣地方所辦的、各市縣的社會狀况、當然是千差萬别各有各的特色、也各有各的困難、辦小學敎育一方面要注意兒童的個性、一方面應當適應地方的社會狀况、這是大家都知道的、而且是大家都承認的、因此要在敎育方案中規定出一個能適合、全國各市縣實際狀况的改進計劃、或者有人以爲是一件不可能的事、</p>
<p>的確要定一個全國各市縣完全適合的辦法、是不可能的、不但理論上可以推想知道是不可能、就是事實上、早已確切證明是不可能、自以前清維新辦學以來、政府已經改過好幾次了、以前的政府也定道好多贊理全國各市縣小學的規程條例等等的辦法頒行的了、試間實際在各市縣辦小學的先生們、已往的規則章程有什麽效用、</p>
<p>在好的機關或小學裏、總覺得規則章程是一個阻碍進步、束縛試騐研究的桎梏、在不好的機關或小學、也不過是奉行故事、或竟陽奉陰違視學先生到時才做一做門面罷了、定辦法的時候、往往只顧到了如何防弊、如何取締、多在消極方面用功夫、結果消極的不能使貪懶的腐敗的知所改進、反而使能自動進步的、有試騐精神受了重大的束縛、這不但是證明不可能、而且可以簡捷爽快的説一句、「不必要！」</p>
<p>不可能可不必要了、何必再在全國敎育方案裏、耗費十六面半的紙張占去一章、</p>
<p>本來天下的事是變的、不是呆定的、統計告訴我們、無論物質方面、人事方面要找出絶對相同而又相等的、是不可能的、要用一個呆板劃一的辦法來管理千變萬化的事物、怎様可以、不過我們人、有一種特殊的本領、會得在變的中間去找出不變的來、統計所得的物象事實、全是變的、從統計裏找出來的原則、却可以把好多的變象歸納在若干不變的公式裏去、辦小學的方法、應當各就市縣的社會狀况而是變的如何處理這變、如何應付這變、却可以根據事實、參考别人家的　　中等敎育組審查委員　光華攝</p>
<p>成敗、找出些公式或彷彿公式原則一類的東西出來、所以我説敎育方案中初等敎育的一部份、應當注重在這一點、</p>
<p>敎育方案、又可以説是行政上一個較詳細的設計、敎育行政、應當用敎育的方法去辦、這也是一個新近的趨向、這不是空理論别人家已經試用過得到相當的成效、敎育的方法、不是呆板的、不是劃一的、然而也不是漫無系統隨便亂來的、我們都知道敎員上課、要有預論的敎案、學校辦事要有預定計劃、辦理敎育行政、也彷彿是一種敎育的作用、那末當然也可有一個預定進行的計劃、而且這計劃應當不是注入的、是輔導的、所以敎育方案中關於初等敎育一部份的計劃、也應當注重這一點、</p>
<p>這兩點找得出來了、方案中初等敎育的一部份、或者能在將來發生些實際的成效、這是我個人的希望、</p>

<p>▲童子軍沿革之槪略</p>

<h3 id="c128">工部局華董問題僵局 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲納税華人會昨開緊急會議</p>
<p>▲日僑代表對我華人表同情</p>
<p>▲工部局將召集西人特别會</p>
<p>公共租界納税華人會代表大會、爲討論工部局華董問題、昨日下午、在商整會、召集臨時緊急會議、討論兩小時、决認納税西人年會對華董議决案爲無效、同時公推三代表、赴外交部、提出嚴重交涉、新當選之五華董堅持向工部局出席、如工部局祇允三華董出席、則另定對付方法、在工部局方面、則照章須遵守納税西人年會之决議、處境十分困難、故該問題大致已成僵局矣、茲述昨聞如次、</p>
<p>▲緊急會結果　納税華人會代表大</p>
<p>會、昨日下午四時、假商整會常委室、舉行臨時緊急會議、到五十餘人、由王曉籟主席、報告開會宗旨、虞洽卿報告、歷次抗爭增加華董情形、討論如何不承認納税西人决定納税華人權利方法案、一致議决、（一）登報宣言、納税西人會、無權措置華人會華董問題、（二）駁斥英律師麥克唐之言論、由大會秘書起草、由大會主席會同華董委員、修正發表、（三）電請外部嚴重交涉、並推定王曉籟虞洽卿胡孟嘉向外部請願、</p>
<p>▲納税會宣言　上海租界納税華人</p>
<p>會宣言云、本會確認上海公共租界納税西人會、無權討論關於公共租界納税華人應有之市民權利、根據此項原則、對於本年四月十六日納税西人會否决增加工部局華董兩人一案、當然無效、特此鄭重宣言、</p>
<p>▲政工部局函　該會經前日代表大</p>
<p>會、選出華董委員及執行委員後、除函當選人通知各團體機關外、並正式通知公共租界工部局董事會、原函云、逕啓者、所有民國十九年至二十年底代表界内納税華人出席貴局執行公務之董事、業遵本國政府行政院外交部令知、准駐華西班牙公使照會、贊成自三席增至五席、於四月十六日、由本會代表大會、選舉袁履登·虞洽卿·徐新六·貝淞孫·劉鴻生·五君担任、其六席委員、選舉林康侯·泰潤卿·陳霆鋭·李馥蓀·錢龍章·吳藴齋等六君担任、相應檢同董事委員履歷、函請查照爲荷、此致上海公共租界工部局總董麥克拿登先生、附董事委員履歷一紙、主席王曉籟·徐寄廎·中華民國十九年四月十七日、</p>
<p>▲外董昨就職　工部局外籍董事九</p>
<p>人英籍六、日籍二、美籍一、均於昨午、在工部局就任、惟華董因未接工部局總辦處通知、故未前往、外董九人、則照往年慣例、推選總副董事、一致舉麥克拿登爲總董、歇巴爲副總董、茲關於華董增加二席否决經過、有一段事實、頗饒興趣、特附誌於此、前日之納税西人年會、祗到二百五十二人、因該年會無法定人數之規定、故即使祗到一二人、亦可照常開會、至反對華董增加案之動議人麥克唐、爲一律師、本在宏恩醫院養病、不料突然出席、發表演説、軒然大波、由是而起、舉手否决之多數西人、事後回思、頗多懊喪云</p>
<p>▲工部局態度　本報記者、昨訪工部</p>
<p>局總辦愛德華、詢以工部局所處之地位、及其解决該問題之辦法、愛德華氏答稱、工部局全體外董、及總裁費及惇與渠、爲謀中外實行合作、對提出華董自三席增至五席一案、確具誠意、工部局且自信該案必能順利通過於納税西人年會、而結果竟遭否决、完全出乎意料之外、如此事與願違、工部局十分抱歉、更以納税西人會爲工部局之主人、該會之决議、工部局惟有遵從、故該問題之横生波折、並非工部局之咎、希望華人方面原諒、不爲此而加工部局以處分、工部局於今午會議、各董事對此不幸事件、一致表示遺憾、爲暫時委曲求全計、惟有希望新當選之五華董中得最多數三華董、照常出席工部局、三君爲原任董事、歷來與工部局合作、感情頗好、工部局甚歡迎其出席也、苟如報載、五華董如堅持同時出席、否則全體缺席、則本年度工部局華董、祗有暫付缺如、中外合作、因是退歸五年前之狀况矣、另一消息、昨日本埠外僑以當時由一人演説反對、投票者不予細審、遽加否决、大爲不滿、工部局爲俯順輿情計、擬於日内召集納税西人特别會議、重行考慮此案、俾作透澈之討論、期逹最初之目的　　▲特别西人會　記者嗣訪副總辦瓊</p>
<p>士、詢問臨時召集納税西人特别會、將該案重付表决事、瓊士答稱、此事原屬目下惟一補救辦法、惟據其已往經騐、覺於召集上頗爲因難、因納税西人年會、並無法定人數之規定、如召集特别會、須有二十五人提議、此固可辦到、然尙有法定人數之規定、即須納税外籍市民三分之一以上出席、方得開會、全埠納税外人約三千人、如以三分之一爲法定人數、則須一千人以上出席、工部局於一九二五年、爲取締童工問題、欲召集特别會而未果、此後工部局欲修改章程、屢欲行之而屢不成功、故今次能否開成、尙無把握、</p>
<p>▲重光氏談話　日代使重光、工部</p>
<p>局日董福島·及齋藤、與日商會代表等、昨亦在駐滬日總領事館、討論該問題數小時、已議有具體辦法、大致對我方同情、日内即有援助之表示、重光氏昨並爲此、發表談話云、上海公共租界工部局華董、由三人增至五人一案、早經市參事會全體贊成通過、余對於此舉、認爲適合事宜、并信爲最公正之措置、表示極端之贊同、且知上海之日僑亦皆表同意於此舉、因余接得報告、知昨日出席於納税西人會之日本人、皆贊成增加華董案、昨日納税西人會、竟有如此之結果、想係驟然提出反對原案之動議、致不及從長計議之故、余意以爲此種關係全上海行政上大問題之議案、應當俟贊否兩方面充分舌戰之後、再行决定、余當以代理公使及總領事之資格、愼重考慮後、努力謀適當之措置、余甚望結局、終能實現市參事會之最公正之决定、此不僅余個人之意見、亦即日僑之代表的意見也云云、</p>
<p>▲日董之聲明　工部局日董福島·齋</p>
<p>滕二君、昨來本館、代表全體納税日人聲明、謂日人對於華董增席案、素極贊助、乃因不諳英文者頗多、故前日納税人年會、出席者不多、致華董增席案、突被否决、彼輩均表示遺憾云云、至本報昨載該案否决由日人操縱所致、實屬傳聞之誤、</p>

<p>— 劍儂寄自徐州</p>
<p>蔣主席蒞徐情形。已詳紀各報。惟尙有軼事零聞。爲各報所未紀者。擷而誌之。亦迎蔣佳話也</p>
<p>▲烈士墓之憑弔　城南雲龍山下之烈士公墓。爲第一軍北伐烈士遺骸之所寄。建於十七年冬。十八年夏重修。近復擴充。加葬第一師迭次討逆陣亡將士。已在施工之中。蔣主席於清晨甫行下車在二路總部召見各將領而後。即乘汽車赴墓道憑弔。同行者有劉峙。顧祝同。韓復榘。馬鴻逵。賀耀組。陳繼承。徐庭瑤等各重要將領。維時各記者分電二路總部。車站。隴海路一號房。九里山各處。迄未得主席踪迹之所在。故各報均無此條新聞。頗爲缺憾也。</p>
<p>▲小朋友之召見　主席當前歲北伐時。曾遊雲龍山。識一攝影家之幼子張紹新者。甚愛之。呼爲小友。曾携之往總司令部遊玩。厥後每當來徐。有暇輒召見之。此次至烈士墓。又憶及小友。差弁召之來。蔣立墓壇上向之云。「小朋友。一年多没有見你了」。張答云。「我一年多也没有見主席。現在是三次北伐了」。蔣又訽張以家庭現執何業。張答稱在本山攝影。蔣聞之。即云。「很好。我們就攝影去吧」。於是主席即偕各將領到雲龍山攝影一幀。張爲其父携鏡機。蔣甚嘉之。予昨遊雲龍山。至張所設之寄雲照像館。詢之張紹新所自言者。并觀得蔣與諸將領之合照。非子虚也。張今年十五歲。在户部山小學校肄業。</p>
<p>▲雲龍山之攝影　蔣參觀烈士墓而後。即偕各將領在雲龍西麓攝影。蔣御黑色披風。同攝者爲韓復榘劉峙馬鴻逵賀耀組顧祝同陳繼承徐庭瑤等。是處有明萬歷十四年徐州兵備右參政柳城莫與齊所書之雲龍山三字摩崖。并有去歲戴季陶先生來徐遊覽時所書之摩崖。石壁已鑿就。尙待付刋云。（却酬）</p>

<p>坐在火車車廂裏向窗外眺望。千萬不可對着車頭。因爲煤烟會吹進眼中的。</p>
<p>▲在長江輪船統艙或三四等車廂裏。每每有人走來走去高叫當心毳手。你切不可用手在身上摸摸銀錢是否還仍存在。那麽就受了人騙。曉得你錢在何處。便容易下手了。</p>
<p>▲眼鏡務要揩拭放置得法。不使玻面生毛痕。否則不獨不能輔助目光。還不時有頭痛眩暈之害。</p>
<p>▲用浴堂或酒館等公共地方的手巾揩臉時。必須把眼睛閉好。恐怕上面有淋菌。能使眼睛失明。或者有其他眼病的菌。亦足以有害你眼睛的健康。</p>
<p>▲每次小便時咬着牙齒。可以使牙齒終身不落。牢固而且無疾病。書上也曾説過的。我在上海目睹一位八十一歲的老者能吃花生米。他説就是行的這個法子。好在不費什麽本錢。大家何不照這様的做去。能得到健康的牙齒。也算是一種幸福啊。</p>

<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>攷墓。説文云。丘也。鄭司農謂冢塋之地。孝子所思慕之處。故曰墓。周禮春官。墓大夫掌。凡邦墓之地域爲之圖。令國民族葬。凡爭墓地聽其獄訟。帥其屬而巡墓厲。註墓厲謂塋限遮烈之處。庶人不封不樹。故不言冢而云墓。揚子方言。凡葬無墳謂之墓。有墳謂之塋。故檀弓云。墓而不墳。又平日墓。封曰冢。高日墳。然又謂古不修墓。易墓非古也。是其制與今之溷言墓者異。</p>
<p>俗云掛墓。不知始於何時。春秋時延陵季子。北過徐君。徐君好季札劍。口弗敢言。季札心知之。爲使上國。未獻。還至徐。徐君已死。於是乃解寶劍。繫之徐君冢樹而去。從者曰。徐君已死。尙誰予乎。季子曰不然。始吾心已許之。豈以死倍吾心哉。此載之龍門史記。是云掛劍耳。今人謂之掛墓。其來有自。而其意則非。</p>
<p>或曰掃墓。非掛墓也。然吳人墓音讀若唔。與田畝之畝。不念正音相同。至有以紙錢掛墓者。此物亦呼之爲墓音。而竟曰唔。令人驟聞之。幾不解其所以。良可笑焉。昔人以得上祖宗之丘墓爲榮。而逹觀者。則謂其人已死。其鬼不靈。曾見有生前酒肉。携入九原者乎。宋詩有云。「紙灰飛作白蝴蝶。淚血染成紅杜鵑。」又云。「賢愚千載知誰是。滿眼蓬蒿共一邱。」亦可謂嘅乎言之已。</p>
<p>值此清明時節。出郭門不數步。往往見有躑躅於衰草荒壤之間者。未幾。而豚一蹄。酒數行。寡妻弱妾拜者拜而獻者獻。酒肉之氣。薰於四野。哭聲凄惻。與松揪淅淅之聲相應。睨其傍者。亦爲之欷歔不已。然此所謂靑冢也。其人雖死。其骨未寒。若生存華屋處。零落歸山邱。牧童樵豎。砍墓木以當薪。狡兎豐狐。鑿墓田而爭穴。縱有殘碑斷碣。殭仆路旁。而無有識其姓氏者。况荒冢纍纍。彌望皆是。而能不指墓門而長歎者。亦幾希矣。三十年前吾國有以人滿爲患者。或曰無慮。所慮者鬼滿耳。鬼滿。即指墓地而云。今思之良信。</p>

<p>畹華此次來美。受無上之歡迎且以中國純粹之舊劇。而受無上之歡迎。尤爲喜出望外。此間眞有在行而用心研究者。前已將楊君（美國有名之文豪）Ｓtark　Young批評間錄出。茲再將其近日談話最錄如下。</p>
<p>汾河灣二次出場。用手掃箕。中土以迷薛目時。第一次演。口掃一下。其後連掃二三下。實不及第一次之美觀。（按所云第一次者。爲戲中之身段。其後所做則近寫實派矣。故云楊君在行也）因爲鬚生不甚出色。致梅君減去精采。倘換一個好配角。梅君當更要好幾倍。吾想梅君在中國表演。當更勝乎此。在此間演奏。似有遷就美國人之處。我勸梅君千萬不必如此。致損中劇之價值。此次來觀梅君劇者。皆按極高尙之藝術觀之。或按古代雕刻觀之。故倘有不了解之處。亦屬毫無妨碍。愈是按照中國舊劇式表演。大家愈歡迎。愈感興味。中國劇雍容大雅。位置之高。分量之重。爲世界戲劇之冠。吾此次看梅君之　。對於戲劇之原理。明白了許多。對於世界藝術之原理。亦明白了許多。眞是異常愉快。　　我看梅君嗓音甚好。似是不敢用力唱。其實不要緊。紐約人旣承認了中國劇爲世界藝術。梅君便應極力發揮中國固有的長處。發揮愈力。歡迎愈深。因爲大家不是取樂來的。乃是研究來的。是研究東方藝術來的。故梅君萬不可中餒。致損梅君藝術之價值。並損中國劇之地位。　　美國每數年必有一奪錦標者。即是指全國注目之人而言。無論政學各界人士。皆在其内。此數年來之奪錦標者。則爲梅君。</p>
<p>以上乃楊君所談論之大致也。楊君之在行。眞足令人折服。凡畹華作戲稍有改動。彼必知之。故畹亦頗小心。每次皆有一定地方。否則必有人詰問。楊君又云。第一次所演剌虎之自刎。較後來好看的多等語。可知觀者之用心也。</p>

<p>文武老生李吉瑞。年逾六旬。健且如昔。其壓棄粉墨生涯者。蓋已十年於茲矣。此次因上海舞台之常雲恒専誠北上。以禮羅致。情有難却。不得已隻身南下。故調復彈。得與春申顧曲諸君重見於紅氍毹上。謂非意想不到之良觀歟。</p>
<p>李之成名。遠在四十年前。民國初年。享盛名於京津。曾以某舞台之聘。來滬獻藝一月。余嘗聆其落馬湖連環套諸劇。嘆爲觀止。此次重逢。本非所料。連日又得欣賞其得意傑作風波亭九義十八俠臥虎溝諸戲。精神飽滿。步伐從客。望之如三十許人。風頭不减當時。而細膩則又過之。其黄鐘大呂之音。固他伶所不及。而觀其表情之周到。説白之乾脆。宛如與古英雄俠士相晤對。不禁令人志爲之高。膽爲之壯。至其飾風波亭中之岳王。則忠肝義膽。躍躍如疾風閃電然。體會蓋有獨到處。於以知藝術之成。斷非幸運與偶然所能想望也。</p>
<p>宏碧緣一劇。係從綠牡丹説部所脱胎。李曾編爲本戲。出演於京津間。旋由呂月樵排演於春申江上。一時觀者稱道。叫座力得未曾有。此番李已允爲編排。不久當與觀衆相見。是亦有周郎癖者之一好消息也。老鄉親孫菊仙氏。聞於二十左右可到。或於李之臨别前加入登台。孫今年正九十歲。聞其唱念猶如曩時。而耳已微聾。然得胡琴之襯托得法。尙不致有走板處。届時九六一百五十歲之兩老人。共相搭當。亦海上劇界之新紀錄歟。</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Envoy Arrives in Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Weihaiwei Issue with the Foreign Minister</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Envoy Lampson arrived in Beijing at 11:00 AM on the 17th aboard the British warship HMS Grantham. Personnel from the British Legation in Beijing and the External Affairs Liaison Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were dispatched to Xiaguan to welcome him. When the warship arrived at Xiaguan, warships from various countries anchored along the riverbank fired a 21-gun salute. After Lampson disembarked, he went to the British Legation in Beijing by car with two secretaries to rest and arranged a meeting time with the Foreign Minister. Because Wang Zhengting was attending the Capital Construction Committee meeting, they scheduled a meeting at 3:00 PM at the official residence of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Saji灣. The British Envoy arrived on time at 3:00 PM. Regarding the return of Weihaiwei, they discussed for about half an hour. It is rumored that after the draft agreement for the recovery of Weihaiwei was signed by Lampson during his last visit to Beijing, the original text was sent to London for review by the British government. Before Lampson's arrival in Beijing this time, he had already received instructions from the British government. However, when Lampson met with the Foreign Minister on the 17th, there were still one or two points regarding the return of Weihaiwei that both sides could not fully agree on. Although the draft agreement has been signed, the clauses still need to be revised, so the formal signing cannot be resolved within a day or two. According to general observations, this is because: 1. Weihaiwei's harbor allows British naval vessels to take shelter without restrictions and without collecting ship taxes; 2. The British side demands excessive compensation for all British buildings in Weihaiwei city and harbor, which our side cannot agree to. Therefore, further consultation is needed.

<p>The powerful countries of the world today will all suffer the consequences of their excessive ingenuity, fierce competition, and extravagant indulgence. They exhaust the world's economy to fish, and it is only by chance that they are unaware of their difficulties. They are still ambitious and arrogant, infringing on everything, believing that they are the chosen ones of heaven and can always maintain their noble lives. This is a big mistake. In the future, the decline of commerce will become more and more serious, and there may never be a revival without undergoing some kind of change. The powerful industrial countries will be the first to be affected. This is not because non-industrial and non-prosperous countries are resisting, but because the manufacturing power of industrial countries far exceeds the consumption power of non-industrial countries. It is like food. If someone is already full, they cannot be forced to eat more. It is like selling food to a sick person. Even if they want to eat, they cannot swallow it, and they cannot be forced to eat more. The current economic recession is similar to this. Therefore, the non-industrial and non-prosperous countries will inevitably be exhausted and become more impoverished. The industrial and prosperous countries have expanded too much and cannot be contained, and they are accustomed to enjoyment and cannot maintain it, so they will inevitably fall into difficulties from prosperity. Therefore, chaotic countries will become more chaotic, and well-governed countries will also become chaotic. The world is more chaotic, and commerce is becoming more and more depressed. This is inevitable. Today is the impetus, and the future evolution will inevitably follow this path. Two important domestic telegrams</p>

Review opinions: It should be handled jointly with Liu Jiwen's proposal to draft a zoning plan for the capital. It was resolved to approve the review opinions.</p>
<p>Next, Yang Xixu, a member of the Third Group Review Committee, reported: (First Report) The twenty-fourth case, proposed by Sun Ke, concerns renovating the capital's silk weaving industry; the forty-first case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, proposes promoting appropriate handicrafts in the capital; the fortieth case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, proposes promoting industry in the capital; and the fiftieth case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, proposes developing new industries in the capital. The four cases were combined for discussion. Review opinions: The main points of the above four cases are all to develop industry in the capital, and they are of the same nature and should be combined into one case. The fiftieth case should be the main case. The first item of measures, "Methods to be adopted for developing industry in the capital," is considered appropriate and can be adopted. The second item of measures are all practical enterprises, but they are not exclusively within the scope of capital construction and should be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Beijing Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau for guidance. It was resolved to delete the phrase "Industries operated by foreigners are not included in this example" at the end of the first item, and the remainder was approved according to the review opinions. (Second Report) The forty-seventh case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, concerns the capital's forest park construction plan; the forty-eighth case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, proposes raising funds to selectively purchase land to promote construction; and the sixtieth case, proposed by Lu Dipin, proposes requesting the allocation of large sums of money to purchase private land in the capital to reorganize the land and develop municipal administration. The three cases were combined for discussion. Review opinions: The forty-eighth case should be the main case, and the established principles are all necessary and should be approved. As for the amount of land to be purchased and the funds to be allocated from the construction bonds, they cannot be decided by this committee in a short time and should be submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. It was resolved to approve the review opinions. (Third Report) The thirty-eighth case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, concerns establishing a rice market in the capital to revitalize commerce and regulate the people's food supply. After review, it was determined that it concerns commerce and the people's food supply and is under the purview of other specialized agencies and is not the responsibility of this committee. It should be submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Food Committee and the Beijing Municipal Government for joint handling. It was resolved to approve the review opinions. (Fourth Report) The thirty-second case, proposed by Liu Jiwen, proposes organizing a capital exposition to revitalize the capital's local area. After review, it was determined that the effect of the exposition can indeed revitalize the capital's local area, and the principles of the original case were approved. The date of the exposition will be determined separately by the Standing Committee. It was resolved to approve the review opinions. (Fifth Report) The forty-ninth case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, proposes establishing large-scale civilian factories in the capital to relieve unemployment.

It was resolved to approve the review opinions. (Eighth Report) The forty-seventh case, proposed by Kong Xiangxi, concerns the capital's forest park construction plan; and the fifty-ninth case, proposed by Lu Dipin, concerns developing forests in the capital. After review, it was determined that it can be approved in principle, and the detailed plan should be submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion. It was resolved to approve the review opinions.</p>
<p>Finally, Wei Daoming, a member of the Temporary Proposal Group Review Committee, reported: (First Report) The case proposed by Yang Xixu concerns building more affordable housing to benefit residents. Review opinions: This case has the same principles as the twenty-first case proposed by Sun Ke, which concerns the increasing population of the capital and proposes to select land to build more public housing to benefit residents, and can be combined for discussion. It was resolved to approve the review opinions. (Second Report) The capital's construction costs are enormous, and how should they be raised?

<p>▲ Closing Ceremony Held in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The conference discussed each case individually, and by 1:00 PM, all cases had been completed. The closing ceremony was then held on the spot, chaired by Zhang Renjie. After the ceremony, Kong Xiangxi delivered a closing speech on behalf of the attendees, briefly stating the importance and significance of this conference. All committee members and representatives are very clear about what we should pay attention to, that is, the current capital construction must conform to the trend of the times, conform to revolutionary construction, and conform to economic principles. To be a model for national construction, so that people at home and abroad are satisfied, and the current capital construction is in accordance with the Premier's construction will, reflecting the spirit of innovation of the Chinese nation. The responsibilities and missions everyone bears are also very important. I hope that all representatives will present the central government's fighting spirit to the authorities of various provinces and cities, so that they know the central government's difficulties. The capital is the capital of the whole country and has a direct relationship with all provinces and cities. We must work together to help it complete as soon as possible. The expenses that should be shared must be remitted on time, and whether all provinces and cities can help the central government do things can also be proved by this. Whether the central government's policies are supported or not, and whether the central government has the ability to unify, will also be seen here. I would like to offer my opinions and hope that everyone will not fail this mission, and so on. Then the music was played, the ceremony was completed, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Preliminary Points on the Kinship and Inheritance Sections of the Civil Code (Continued) <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲Hu Hanmin and Lin Sen Request a Decision from the Central Political Council</p>
<p>(2) What should be the age of marriage? According to the laws of various countries, in order to prevent early marriage, regulations on the age of marriage are often set. However, the standards are not consistent. Some notable examples include: Sweden, male 21, female 18; Germany, male 21, female 16; Switzerland and Norway, male 20, female 18; Prussia, male 19, female 17; France, Italy, Belgium, Romania, Netherlands, Portugal, and Hungary, male 18, female 15; Prussia, male 18, female 14; Austria, male 14, female 14; England and Spain, male 14, female 12. According to our country's general code, in ancient times, men married at 50 and women at 30; in medieval times, men took a wife at 30 and women at 20. However, the old laws did not have explicit regulations on the age of marriage. When drafting the kinship law this time, what age should be set as the age of marriage? This is the fourth point to be decided in advance. (3) What should be the restrictions on marriage between relatives? According to the laws of various countries, the restrictions on marriage between relatives vary. Some define the scope as direct blood relatives, direct relatives by marriage, and collateral blood relatives within the third degree, such as the Japanese Civil Code. Others define the scope as direct blood relatives, siblings, half-siblings, and direct relatives by marriage, such as the German Civil Code. Still others define the scope as direct blood relatives, siblings, and half-siblings, such as the Soviet Russian Civil Code. Some only define the scope as direct blood relatives and siblings, such as the Siamese Civil Code draft. The old laws of our country had very strict restrictions on marriage between relatives: 1. The wives and concubines of relatives of the same clan, whether divorced or remarried, were prohibited from marrying. 2. Half-siblings, even if they were not from the same clan, were also prohibited from marrying. 3. Marriages between relatives of different generations were prohibited. 4. Even if they were not relatives, marriages between those with obvious generational differences were also prohibited. How should our kinship law be regulated? This is the fifth point to be decided in advance. (4) How should the marital property system be regulated? According to the legislative examples of various countries, the marital property system can be divided into three types: 1. Community property system: The husband and wife each contribute a part or all of their property to form community property, with the husband having the right to manage it, but its disposal requires the wife's consent. 2. Joint management system: The husband and wife combine their property, with the husband having the right to manage it, but each retains ownership. 3. Separate property system: The ownership and management rights of the husband and wife's property are independent, and the family expenses are borne jointly by the husband and wife. Furthermore, the laws of various countries either designate one of the above systems as the statutory property system, which is deemed to be adopted if the parties have no other agreement, or set up several other systems outside the statutory system as standards for concluding property contracts, from which the parties can choose one, or do not set up the above standards and allow the parties to freely agree on their property relationship by contract. How should our kinship law be regulated? This is the sixth point to be decided by public vote. (5) Can the issue of concubines be resolved by separate legislation? According to our country's system of concubinage, what is the status of the concubines who have been taken and their children? If there are no explicit provisions, it is difficult to apply. Can this be resolved by separate legislation? This is the seventh point to be decided by public vote. (6) If the family system needs to be defined, how should it be regulated? The kinship laws of various countries adopt either the family system or the individual system. Those who adopt the family system regard the family as the basis of society, and the law recognizes the existence of the family system. Those who adopt the individual system regard the individual as the basis of society, and the law does not recognize the existence of the family system. However, in countries that adopt the family system, some combine the clan with the family, such as Japan. Anyone who inherits the family also inherits the clan. Although there is a so-called family in our country in practice, there are no clear regulations on the organization and status of the family in law. Furthermore, the clan is the clan, and the family is the family. The clan refers to the relationship in the system, while the family refers to the actual organization. Should the family system be regulated in this drafting of the kinship law? This is the eighth point to be decided in advance. If the family system is regulated, the laws of various countries either take the authority of the head of the family as the basis, such as the Japanese Civil Code, or take the common life as the basis, such as the Swiss Civil Code. The former's so-called family takes those under the jurisdiction of the head of the family as members and those within the scope of the head of the family's authority as the scope. The latter's so-called family is based on people living together and is established out of the need for support and guardianship, not focusing on the rights of the head of the family, but focusing on the obligations of the head of the family. If our kinship law needs to regulate the family system, how should it be regulated? This is the ninth point to be decided in advance.</p>
<p>▲Points to be Decided in Advance on Inheritance Law (1) Should the inheritance of the ancestral temple be regulated? Is the inheritance of the estate predicated on the inheritance of the ancestral temple? According to our country's clan, the male line has always been emphasized. After three generations, the eldest son of the princes inherited the title of prince, and the descendants of the collateral lines were of various kinds. The Zhou people used the method of the great clan and the small clan to consolidate their group. Later Confucian scholars spoke of rites and mostly focused on the clan law. The emperors of past dynasties also compromised in this regard. Therefore, the clan law became the clan law, not only practiced by the collateral descendants of princes and nobles, but also imitated by ordinary people. Through inheritance and changes, it has become the clan system of today. Should the inheritance of the ancestral temple be regulated in this drafting of the inheritance law in our country? This is the first point to be decided in advance. If the inheritance of the ancestral temple should be regulated, it should also be clearly stipulated whether the person who inherits the ancestral temple is the person who inherits the estate, so as to avoid doubts. This is the second point to be decided in advance. (2) How should the scope and order of heirs and their shares be regulated? The laws of various countries are very inconsistent regarding the scope and order of heirs and their shares. Taking the German and Japanese civil codes as examples, Germany divides heirs into two types: designated heirs and statutory heirs. Statutory heirs are limited to spouses and direct relatives. The order of inheritance, except for the spouse of the deceased, varies depending on whether there are relatives of the first or second degree. The direct descendants of the deceased are the first in order, the parents of the deceased and their direct descendants are the second in order, the grandparents of the deceased and their direct descendants are the third in order, and the great-grandparents of the deceased and their direct descendants are the fourth in order. The fifth order and below are the distant ancestors of the deceased and their direct descendants. The share of the heir, except for the surviving spouse of the deceased, varies depending on whether there are relatives of the first or second degree. The rest are divided equally according to the order of precedence, with the closest relatives receiving the most. Japan also limits the scope to spouses and direct relatives, but the direct descendants of the deceased are the first in order, the spouse of the deceased is the second in order, the direct ascendants of the deceased are the third in order, and the head of the household is the fourth in order. The principle of their share is the same as in Germany. However, when there are several direct descendants, the share of illegitimate children and children born out of wedlock is one-half of that of legitimate children. As for the old laws of our country, 1. The inheritance of the estate is limited to direct descendants. Spouses and direct ascendants have no right to inherit the estate. 2. Those direct descendants who can inherit the estate are limited to men. Women can only inherit the property of a deceased household, but have no right to inherit the estate. 3. In the analysis and distribution of the estate, except for illegitimate children who are given half according to the amount of children, both legitimate and illegitimate children, male and female, are divided equally according to the number of children. Since the circumstances at home and abroad are so different, how should our inheritance law be regulated? This is the third point to be decided in advance. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee believes that the large Japanese fleet's arrival in China and its holding of spring exercises near the Zhoushan Islands in Zhejiang Province is an insult to our country. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to lodge a serious protest against Japan, it also telegraphed the Dinghai County District Executive Committee and the Zhenhai County Executive Committee to quickly report the details of the Japanese fleet's spring exercises in Zhoushan. The following are the two telegrams: (1) To the esteemed Central Executive Committee, we have learned that Japanese imperialism has long harbored ambitions to invade China. This time, taking advantage of the Central Government's suppression of Yan and Feng, it has spared no effort to resort to its old tricks, sending a large fleet of warships to China. Its intentions are self-evident. All Chinese people have long been indignant. Now, reports state that the country's warships will hold large-scale spring exercises near Zhoushan Island on the 16th of this month. After reading this, we are furious. Its contempt for our country's sovereignty and its violation of international law are extreme. If this can be tolerated, the country will not be a country. Therefore, we telegraph Your Committee to quickly transfer and instruct to lodge serious negotiations and find ways to stop it. This committee vows to lead all comrades and the people of the province as a backing to avenge this humiliation and defend national rights. The urgent situation cannot be described enough. The Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee respectfully bows. (2) Urgent to Dinghai County Directly Subordinate District Party Department and Zhenhai County Party Department, reports state that Japanese warships will hold spring exercises near our country's Zhoushan Islands today. We hope that you will quickly and accurately investigate and report the details. Do not delay. The Provincial Executive Committee bows.</p>
<h3 id="e71">The Central Government Abolishes the Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee previously learned that the Fujian Provincial Civil Affairs Department had established a Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee in Xiamen, with Dai Jinhua as the director, using registration as a pretext to extort overseas Chinese, and had been repeatedly accused. Furthermore, its name and nature contradicted the organizational regulations of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. It had submitted a request to the Central Government to transfer the order to the province to abolish it. After the Central Government's 36th resolution, the Fujian Provincial Government was ordered to change the name of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee under its jurisdiction to avoid confusion with the name and functions of the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee. As for all its handling procedures, it still had to be reported to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for record. A letter was sent to the National Government to transfer and instruct compliance. Later, a letter was received from the Central Secretariat, stating that it had been approved by the National Government's Civil Affairs Office and that the National Government had issued a report from the Fujian Provincial Government, according to the Civil Affairs Department, to change the name of the Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee to the Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, to draft a simple charter, and to prepare a separate budget. A copy of the original document was sent for reference. The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee believed that after reviewing the bureau's charter, the scale was too large and still contradicted the committee's organizational regulations. It submitted another request to the Central Government to transfer and instruct it to change to the Fujian Overseas Chinese Compatriots Reception Center. The Central Government approved the transfer to the Executive Yuan for investigation and handling. Recently, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee sent personnel to investigate. The bureau had not changed its name and was still called the Xiamen Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and it had harassed overseas Chinese. Therefore, it submitted another request to the Central Government to explicitly abolish it. Now, a reply letter has been received from the Central Secretariat, stating that according to the Executive Yuan's report, the Fujian Provincial Government has been ordered to comply. Therefore, the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau will be abolished soon.</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Situation in Western Hunan Expands <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>▲Li Guojun's Troops Collude with the Guizhou Army</p>
<p>▲He Jian Dispatches More Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence, Chen Hanzhang, the brigade commander of the Independent 8th Brigade, was assassinated in Hongjiang last month and died shortly after his injuries flared up. Li Guojun, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the brigade, was originally the mastermind behind Chen's assassination. Therefore, the day after Chen was assassinated, he led the entire unit from his garrison in Zhijiang to attack Qianyang and seize Hongjiang. Within three days, he was repelled by the 1st and 2nd Regiments led by Chen Wo, the acting brigade commander of the brigade, and Hongjiang was restored. Internal infighting led to the war between Hunan and Guizhou. The reason why Li's regiment dared to rebel this time was that they had colluded with Xie Bin of the 10th Division stationed in Tianzhu, Guizhou, and Yao Fengting and Tang Qingyun, the notorious bandits of Hunan and Guizhou. Therefore, after Li's troops were defeated and left Hongjiang, Xie Bin's troops advanced from Tianzhu and stationed in Huaihua and Zhijiang in Hunan Province to assist Li's regiment. They made an appointment with Yao and Tang's bandits to launch a fierce attack on Qianyang. Chen Wo personally led the 1st Regiment and Xiong Pinjun's 2nd Regiment, as well as the special artillery engineering battalion, to fight desperately. They attacked each other for twelve days, and both sides suffered heavy casualties, especially Chen Wo's troops. Therefore, on the 12th, they abandoned Qianyang and retreated to Hongjiang. Hongjiang is a commercial port area and has no defenses. Therefore, when Xie and Li's troops pursued and approached, Chen Wo withdrew from Hongjiang again on the 13th and concentrated in Suining to reorganize and wait for reinforcements. After receiving the report, He Jian believed that Xie's division openly aided the rebellious troops and occupied Hongjiang, which was not something that friendly troops should do. He has telegraphed Xie Bin again, ordering him to leave the border of Hunan immediately and not to interfere in the affairs of the rebellious troops. Otherwise, it is his duty to take appropriate self-defense measures. It is difficult to determine whether Xie will leave Hunan because he has not received a reply. However, in order to thoroughly resolve the rebellious troops, He has decided to transfer four regiments to assist Chen Wo in formally suppressing Li's regiment. The transferred troops are one regiment each from Dai Douyuan and Peng Weiren's brigades of the 16th Division, one regiment from Li Xuan's regiment of the 15th Division, and one regiment from the 1st Garrison Army. Chen Wo's two regiments are assigned to the middle route, Dai's brigade and Chen's regiment are assigned to the right wing, and they are to coerce the left side of Hongjiang and Qianyang from Xupu and Chenxi. Peng's brigade and Li Xuan's regiment are assigned to the left wing, and they are to attack the right side of Hong and Qian from Wugang. He has also telegraphed Mao Guangxiang, the chairman of Guizhou Province, requesting him to order Wang Jialie, the deputy commander of the army, to attack Tianzhu and pursue them from behind. In order to unify the command of the Hunan army, he will telegraph Luo Fanying, the commander of the 16th Division, to rush back to Changsha from Quanzhou on the 15th to plan the suppression. Luo Fanying will be responsible for the command in that area in the future. Luo is expected to leave for Baoqing in two or three days to arrange everything. It is feared that the armies of Hunan and Guizhou will inevitably clash as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Zhu and Mao Capture Xinfeng <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲The County Magistrate Died in Battle</p>
<p>▲The Communist Bandits Slaughtered the City Terribly</p>
<p>Nanchang communication on the 15th, the communist bandits Zhu and Mao, on the 7th and 8th, fled back from Nanxiong and Shixing to Dayu and Xinfeng, causing terrible burning and killing. When Zhu's bandits fled from Xinfeng and Nankang to Guangdong last month, Wu Zhaofeng, the county magistrate of Xinfeng, was quite courageous and personally supervised the team to block and suppress them, so the county territory was preserved. Zhu's bandits hated him deeply, so this time they attacked Xinfeng with all their strength. Their main force was about four or five thousand people, with more than three thousand guns, and their momentum was very fierce. After hearing the alarm, County Magistrate Wu Zhaofeng still supervised Police Captain Wang Tanxun and led the police and security team of about two or three hundred people to resist the enemy. The battle was fierce, but because the number of enemies was too large, they were taken advantage of by the bandits. County Magistrate Wu and Police Captain Wang both ran out of ammunition and were isolated, and died in battle. The city of Xinfeng was captured by the bandits on the 10th. The county government, the party department, and all the public buildings were burned to the ground. Many gentry and businessmen were killed. The cruelty of their trampling was unprecedented. Yesterday, the provincial government received a telegram from those who fled from the county to Ganzhou, requesting that troops be sent quickly to suppress them. Chairman Lu and Commander-in-Chief Jin have telegraphed the Yang, Xiao, Peng, and Yu regiments in southern Jiangxi to quickly suppress them. At the same time, Xie Renzheng and others from Xinfeng who were traveling in the province also received a telegram from the Ganzhou fellow villagers association, reporting the situation of the bandits capturing the county seat and the county magistrate dying in battle. The telegram said, "Zhu and Mao's bandits, on the ash day, led four or five thousand people to capture the county seat. County Magistrate Wu Zhaofeng and Police Captain Wang Tanxun were killed, the county government was burned, and many officials, businessmen, and merchants were brutally killed. They are still entrenched and trampling wildly. In addition to telegraphing the provincial government to send troops to encircle and suppress them, please ask you to quickly petition the provincial government to save the people. The Xinfeng County Fellow Villagers Association in Ganzhou respectfully bows."</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Second Route Headquarters Changes its Name to the Corps Headquarters <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲Liu Zhi Goes to Northern Anhui for Inspection</p>
<p>▲And Announces the Rectification of Military Discipline</p>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence, on the 12th, Liu Zhi received an order from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, ordering the Second Route Army to be renamed the Second Corps, and Liu will continue to serve as the commander-in-chief. The Second Route Headquarters will be changed to the Second Corps Headquarters. After receiving the order, Liu issued a notice on the 14th, complying with the order to change the name. All symbols, badges, etc. issued by the former Second Route Headquarters will be replaced with new items issued by the Second Corps Headquarters from today to identify them. Liu himself, on the morning of the 13th at 6:00 a.m., led Chief of Staff Huang Chang, Section Chief Zhou Xianshi, and several deputies in a special train south for inspection. At 2:00 p.m. on the 14th, he returned to Xuzhou in the original train. In order to rectify military discipline, Liu issued a special order to the troops stationed in Xuzhou, saying, "In order to comply with the order, it is necessary to check the officers and soldiers wearing symbols, so as to clearly show the team number and rank, for the convenience of entering and leaving the inspection, and to prevent traitors from mixing in. It is also to set an example for their body and mind, mutually warn and be cautious, and cut off their debauchery, and create a disciplined army. The intention is very thorough, and the soldiers wearing guns is also for the purpose of proper defense, not for the sake of extravagant and ostentatious decorations. However, recently, it has been found that many officers and soldiers have摘匿symbols,虚掩巧避. The reason for this is that they all harbor opportunistic intentions and act beyond the scope, or they think that wearing symbols will restrict inspection and make debauchery inconvenient, or they think that the rank is too low, which hinders visibility and affects face. It is full of the heart of a concubine穿窬, purely an act of deceiving the world and stealing fame. It seems that they do not seek reality, but specialize in vanity, and the true meaning is completely lost. And soldiers carrying short guns alone, coming and going in deep streets and remote alleys, not only arouse the greed of bandits to covet and intercept, but even use their power to intimidate and供使 to commit crimes. Or they use it to avenge private grudges and use it as a talisman to protect themselves. There have also been cases of people who have lost their caution and injured people, carried guns, and fled. All of the above situations are things that should be deeply warned against in governing the army and governing oneself. Preventing徵杜 and preventing the gradual, one must be cautious. Since the commander-in-chief has been governing the army, he has eliminated浮崇 and promoted reality, and has closely guarded against微幾. He is always cautious and strives to repay the country with his life and cultivate himself with his body. All my comrades should share this intention. All those under the jurisdiction of this route are revolutionary backbone troops. Stationing in the important town of Xuzhou is actually what the four parties are watching and listening to. It is especially valued by the psychology of the masses. In recent days, officers without symbols and soldiers carrying short guns have been coming and going, no different from routed soldiers and roving bandits. All acts of violating prohibitions, committing crimes, and放僻邪侈 are difficult for the police to identify, and it is easy for traitors to巧避. The masses also have no way to指名愬. At this time of crisis, with enemies and detectives lurking and hiding, mixing in and making it impossible to do anything, if the malpractice is allowed to continue, how can it be stopped? In addition to ordering the gendarmerie battalion to patrol strictly, if there are soldiers without symbols or soldiers carrying guns alone, they are allowed to be查拿, and the guns will be confiscated. I hereby order you, the chiefs, to immediately transfer and instruct the officers and soldiers under your command to comply with this order. Do not regard it as a mere formality, lest you be investigated. Be sure to follow this order."</p>

<p>▲Transferred to Tai'an Under the Control of Ma Hongkui</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence, Gao Guizi's troops have been surrounded by the provincial army in Zhucheng and Juxian for nearly two months since February 20th. In the middle, the 46th Division of the provincial army launched several fierce attacks, but failed to break through. Later, the central government sent representative Guo Nianzhen to Zhucheng to contact Gao Guizi about reorganization together with Ma Hongkui's representative. Gao's attitude was stubborn at first, but he gradually became compliant. As of yesterday, it was heard that a compromise had been reached. Gao's troops are under the command of Ma Hongkui. Gao has expressed his approval. The people of Zhucheng have suffered unbearable losses due to the long siege. Recently, they publicly elected representatives Pei Mingyu and Zhang Yanyuan to Jinan to visit Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of the provincial government, to request a peaceful resolution of Gao's troops, but they did not get the point. Recently, Gao's troops have been resolved, and the representatives have met with Wang Mingshuang, the representative of Juxian, to visit Chen Diaoyuan in Jinan, requesting that the provincial army surrounding Zhucheng and Juxian be withdrawn as soon as possible, so as to avoid the suffering of the people in the city for a long time. It is heard that the provincial government is still cautious about this and must wait until Gao's troops have actually been transferred before it can withdraw its defenses, so as to avoid accidents.

<h3 id="e77">Xiamen Cracks Down on Communist Organization <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Although communist parties have been secretly active in this city, there have been no violent riots. However, there have been instances of distributing leaflets and shouting slogans. Recently, after vigorous investigation by the Zhangzhou-Xiamen Garrison Headquarters and the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, a communist organization was successfully cracked down on at No. 9 Qinglong Temple on the 9th of this month. Initially, Yang Zhiguo, a policeman from the First Police Station of the Third Precinct, was conducting a household registration survey. When he arrived in front of No. 9 Qinglong Temple, two young men in Western suits suddenly avoided him. Yang was suspicious and entered the premises for inspection. Inside, there was a young man in his twenties, with several clothes and wooden boxes placed in the corner of the room, appearing as if they had just been moved in. Yang ordered the young man to open them for inspection, but the young man attempted to escape. Yang stopped him and then found a communist leaflet next to a wooden box. When asked where he came from, the young man hesitated for a long time and replied that he did not know. Yang ordered him to open the box for inspection. Upon opening one box, thousands of communist leaflets were found under a leather jacket, wrapped in worn-out clothing. Yang then ordered the police to arrest the young man and escort him and the boxes to the Third Precinct. After examining each item, a total of nine large boxes were found, containing over ten thousand communist-printed and mimeographed reactionary leaflets, and several hundred reactionary books. There were also three boxes of biscuits in a net basket, which, when opened, were also communist leaflets. In addition, there were two boxes of candles, with only a dozen or so candles on the top layer, and the rest filled with leaflets from the Communist Fujian Youth League. Furthermore, three important communist documents were also seized. Due to the importance of the matter, the police station immediately sealed off the house at No. 9 and sent the seized communist items along with the young man to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. According to the young man's confession, his name was Lian Jinhai, he was nineteen years old, and from Longyan. When asked about the source of the boxes and items, he claimed that he was hired by a friend to transport luggage to Xiamen, and he was unaware of the contents and illiterate. The police station is still conducting a rigorous interrogation. It is said that the young man was wearing silk clothes and appeared quite cultured, unlike someone from the working class.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at 7:00 AM on the 9th, many people suddenly distributed communist leaflets on Kaiyuan Road and shouted slogans. By the time the police arrived, they had already dispersed. On the night of the 8th, there were also people distributing communist leaflets near the Yanping Theater on Gulangyu. Liu Zhu, Lai Chen Ya, and Qiu Yazhi, who all appeared to be workers, were arrested by the Public Works Bureau and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters Military Law Department for interrogation on the 10th.

<h3 id="e78">Guangdong Provincial Government Decides to Form Four Security Brigades <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>▲ An Office Will Be Established Under the Provincial Government</p>
<p>▲ The Navy Will Dispatch Additional Duan-Class Warships to Protect Waterways</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, due to the deployment of troops to Guangxi Province, most of the army has been sent to the front lines. Bandits in various regions have been contemplating uprisings. Recently, the Zhu Mao communist bandits in the North River took advantage of the emptiness of the garrison in Nanxiong and successively captured the counties of Shixing and Renhua. The Qinlian, Gaozhou, and Leizhou areas of the South Road have been repeatedly harassed by bandits. Most recently, Yangchun Bay in Yangjiang County was also occupied by bandits. The authorities previously planned to organize a provincial defense army specifically responsible for suppressing bandits in the region. However, due to various reasons, it was not implemented immediately. Recently, with the increasing disturbances caused by bandits in various rivers, the training of local armed forces has become urgent. Yesterday, Chen Mingshu, the chairman of the provincial government, proposed at the 68th provincial affairs meeting that the provincial government organize four security brigades, with a total of 6,000 personnel. Two brigades will be established first, stationed in the northeast and two rivers for training. Initially, 4,000 rifles and 12 machine guns will be purchased, requiring over 600,000 yuan, which will be allocated from the provincial treasury. Due to the urgency of the situation, the arms purchase proposal was submitted for a public vote first and immediately approved. According to the organizational structure of this security brigade, each brigade will consist of 1,500 personnel. The soldiers will be recruited by the county magistrates from able-bodied men within their counties, aged between eighteen and twenty-five, and in good physical condition. The method of recruiting by region stipulates that each county in the Qinlian area will recruit 40 men, each county in the Gaozhou and Leizhou-Yangjiang area will recruit 30 men, and each county in the North River and East River areas will recruit 15 men. They must be selected and sent to the province by April 31st. A security brigade training center will also be established to provide specialized training. After several months of graduation, they will be transferred to various counties to assist local police and protect the area. In the future, an office may be established under the provincial government to command them directly, reporting directly to the provincial government. As for the security of river and sea lanes, the Fourth Fleet will be responsible for dispatching additional Duan-class warships to prevent pirates from intercepting merchant ships. In Guzhen Caobu in Zhongshan County, pirates had previously appeared. Although they have been dispersed, to prevent bandits from regrouping, two warships have been dispatched to be stationed there permanently. In addition to recalling Duan-class warships to patrol the key points of the three mountains and sea entrances outside Guangzhou City, barracks will be built and marines stationed there. The waterways of the West River will be divided into four sections: the Zhujiang Warship will be responsible for security from Wuzhou to Ducheng, the Zhunjie Warship from Ducheng to Zhaoqing, the Jiangg Warship from Zhaoqing to Sanshui, the Haiqiang Warship from Sanshui to Chancun, and the warships attached to the city from Chancun to the provincial capital. In addition to designating the warships, an inspection warship will be dispatched to visit each section of the warship in turn for evaluation. (April 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Eastern Railway Electricity Rights Meeting Approaching <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mo Dehui Plans a Compromise Solution</p>
<p>▲ The Russian Side No Longer Insists on its Proposal</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, 9th: Mo Dehui, on behalf of the Northeast Communications Committee, proposed six points of opinion on the settlement of electricity rights in the Eastern Railway Council. The Russian side did not agree to several items, such as inspecting outbound telegrams. Therefore, on the 21st of last month, the various telegraph bureaus along the line restored their original state. The Communications Committee, fearing that the electricity rights meeting would not be convened and that the power would be completely handed over, leaving no control, retained at least two or three people in each telegraph bureau to monitor the actions of the Russian staff and secretly maintain the intention of inspecting telegrams, while still sending and receiving commercial telegrams to maintain national rights. However, the Russian side was dissatisfied with this, so several days ago, an incident occurred in the Ang'angxi telegraph office in which Chinese staff were expelled and refused entry to work. Later, with the protection of military and police, they were able to re-enter work. Recently, the Russian side believed that if the electricity rights issue was not resolved through necessary procedures at a meeting, the Northeast communications authorities would continue to refuse to release the rights quickly. Therefore, they expressed the following to the six opinions of the Communications Committee: (1) Inspecting outbound telegrams can be changed to inspecting commercial telegrams; administrative telegrams of the railway itself must not be inspected and should be passed through at any time. (2) Equal employment is not an issue; it will be handled by the Eastern Railway Electric Affairs Office and submitted to the Council for decision. (3) Commercial telegrams will not be received by the Eastern Railway and will be sent and received by the Chinese telegraph bureau. Those forwarded through the Eastern Railway will be paid a transit fee by the Chinese side, but the rates for international telegrams to Vladivostok and Moscow must not be increased to avoid affecting Russian merchants. (4) The Chinese side can set up a telegraph bureau between the Eastern Railway's Class A and B stations, provided it does not harm the railway telegraph offices. (5) The electricity fee accounts must be checked by a joint Chinese-Russian committee, and then a section of time will be determined from which year to which year for the inspection period. (6) Long-distance telephones are permitted to be redeemed by China at a price. (7) The electricity rights meeting can be convened immediately. The Communications Committee believes that although the Russian side has agreed to inspect commercial telegrams, since it has agreed to no longer receive commercial telegrams, what telegrams will China inspect in the future? As for international telegram fees, as part of China's administrative affairs, it is difficult to handle the level of not increasing fees, regardless of whether foreigners are involved. Since there are still many differences in other items, it has not yet been approved even after receiving the information. Recently, Mo Dehui, in a detached position, drafted a compromise solution, adopting the opinions of the Communications Committee and the points insisted upon by the Russian side, and drafted eight solutions, which were telegraphed to the Communications Committee yesterday to solicit their agreement. The Communications Committee has held a meeting today to review it and will reply in about two or three days. If the Communications Committee approves it, Mo will no longer seek the Russian side's opinion. If the Russian side also approves it, the Council can order the Railway Bureau to select personnel and convene an electricity rights meeting with the Communications Committee according to this method. In short, the electricity rights meeting, for the sake of overall power, Russia will have to make some concessions in order to comply.</p>

<p>Dispute over Welcoming Guests Leads to Rice Dispute: The day before yesterday (15th), a rice boat arrived from Beiwai, carrying more than 200 dan of rough and white rice. The rice merchant Pan Jinrui transported it from Anhui to the port and first contacted Yin Ruiyuan firm, who purchased more than 100 dan at a price of 14.5 yuan. Then Wu Hengsheng contacted him and offered a price of 14.55 yuan. Yesterday morning, Yin Ruiyuan could add 5 cents and unloaded another 37 dan. The rice was then transferred to Huangtian Port to the east, entered Huangshan Port, and unloaded at Yifengheng outside the East Gate. At about 8:00 AM, Wu Hengsheng found 55 dan of rough rice and 33 dan of white rice that could be transferred to a large boat in the middle of the river by sampan, intending to sell it to Xiagang. The owner of Yin Ruiyuan firm pointed out that the rice on the boat was suspected of being exported and reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which ordered the police to detain it. A meeting of rice merchants was convened at the Rice Industry Association. As a result, Wu Hengsheng transported rice for export, and there was no definite evidence. Yin Ruiyuan also had rice transported east from the Yangtze River, but Wu Hengsheng should not have violated the industry rules by taking over customers. It was agreed that Wu Hengsheng would donate 251 yuan, which would be allocated by the association to the price stabilization bureau in this district to specialize in helping the poor. The detained rice can only be sold in this industry. The matter was finally settled.</p>
<p>Killing Grandfather to Force Marriage of Wife and Niece: Zhang Shaoqing, the bandit leader from Taixing, also known as Weng Tianliang, was arrested in Cheng. Yesterday, it was learned that the bandit had a wife, Chen, also known as Duo Guniang, who also lived in Jiangyin. She was the niece of the victim Xu Huang. Her father's name was Chen Shaoqing, and her mother had died early. She was forced to marry in October of last year. The night before last, she saw her uncle crying in the Datong Hotel, saying that she had been separated from her family and could not find death. She currently has more than 400 yuan deposited in the Fuchangren Dyeing Workshop, but it is difficult to withdraw it for a while. Xu Huang helped her sort it out and took 200 yuan in silver, and the rest will be returned in two installments during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival. On the afternoon of the 16th, Chen and her uncle Xu Huang returned to Taixing together. It is said that Chen is still six months pregnant.</p>

<p>New Director of Finance Bureau Takes Office: Ren Yunkui, the director of the Zhenjiang County Finance Bureau, was transferred to the office and replaced by Wang Zhao Jia. It is learned that Wang arrived at the bureau yesterday to take office.</p>
<p>Tenants Oppose Rent Increase at Wanjie Hall: The property of Wanjie Hall in Zhenjiang has considerable annual income. Since the provincial government moved to Zhenjiang last year, the price of housing has risen. The tenants have already reluctantly increased their rent by 30%. Recently, when demolishing houses to make way for land, the rent collector of the hall seized the opportunity to speak to the long-term tenants, intending to increase the current rent by more than 50%. Because the tenants could not bear the harassment, some people advocated going to the Civil Affairs Office to inquire about the ban issued by the Civil Affairs Office on April 10 of last year and this year, and went to the Party Department to complain. If the rent collector threatens to terminate the contract or relies on his power to force a transfer, the tenants will implement a joint tenants' association as a fundamental defense measure.</p>

<p>Robbery Case Involving Killing Grandfather and Abducting Grandson: At 2:00 AM this morning (16th), at the Xue Shunxing firewood shed at Mabaidu Ferry outside the South Gate, more than ten armed bandits suddenly broke in, ransacking boxes and chests. Xue Guangfu saw the bandits abducting his six-year-old grandson (named Jin Lingzi) from his daughter-in-law's room, so he risked his life to rush forward to snatch him, but was shot twice and fell to the ground and died. After obtaining the hostage, the bandits took the other stolen goods and went south. According to the gang of bandits, they were heavily armed. In addition to countless rifles, there were also five Mauser pistols. Most of them spoke with a Qingzhun accent.</p>
<p>Arrested for Smoking, Mistaken for Bandits: The Yangzhou County Public Security Bureau has been reorganized extensively. Only one of the five branch offices in the city has been retained, and the branch chiefs who have been laid off or transferred are all panicked. Yesterday (15th) was the date of implementation of the reorganization. Two days before the handover, Guo Hanzhang, the chief of the Second Branch in the city, extensively searched for smoking and gambling dens within his jurisdiction. On the night of the 14th, because he arrested a smoking monk, he even used a gold bracelet to represent the fine. Last night (15th), he arrested a smoking den at the home of Dr. Geng Xiaoting in Gengjia Lane. A business group was stationed at the entrance of the lane. Hearing the police, they suspected that there were bandits, so they surrounded Geng's house and exchanged fire for half an hour. The neighbors were terrified. It is now heard that the leading police chief and the reporter of the bureau have been sent to the County Government by Director Zhao of the General Bureau for legal disposal.</p>
<p>Division of Authority Between Police and Public Security: Chen, the County Magistrate of this county, issued an order stating that the investigation and arrest of smoking and gambling should be the responsibility of the public security personnel, and the police team should be responsible for suppressing bandits and arresting criminals. Recently, it has been learned that the police team is extorting money by investigating smoking and gambling, which is very inappropriate. Yesterday (15th), the previous order was reiterated, prohibiting the police team from interfering in smoking and gambling incidents, in order to emphasize the legal order.</p>
<p>New News on Unified Finance: The Jiangdu County Government, according to the resolution on unified local finance at the Second Administrative Conference, instructed the Finance Bureau to comply. Currently, the Finance Bureau reports that, in addition to the transfer of the collection of various donations and taxes from the Public Security Bureau, the various donations and taxes collected by the Education Bureau are still handled by the Education Fund Management Office, and no reply has been received. Yesterday (15th), a request was specially submitted to the County Government, which promptly instructed the Education Bureau to comply with the previous order. At the same time, the directors of the Construction and Finance Bureaus were ordered to jointly discuss and reply whether the slaughter and construction special donations collected by the Construction Bureau are related to the unified finance plan in order to review and handle the matter.</p>

<p>Punishment for Bandits Captured in Eastern Villages: The military police, while suppressing bandits in the eastern villages, have successively captured over 180 male and female bandits, who were then handed over to the Local Pacification Bureau for interrogation. Over thirty individuals with particularly serious involvement have been reported by the county government to the provincial authorities for review and punishment, while those with insufficient evidence of criminal activity have been granted bail.</p>
<p>Deadline for National Salvation Fund Remittance: The former National Salvation Association of Nantong is still collecting the National Salvation Fund. The current County Reorganization Committee, acting on provincial orders to investigate regular meetings, has resolved to set a deadline of ten days for those handling the funds to provide a clear accounting. Failure to comply within the deadline will result in a report to the province for a wanted order.</p>

<p>Bandits with Broadswords Flee into Anhui Province: A portion of Anhui bandits, after fleeing into Zhejiang, joined forces with the Broadsword Society bandits of Changxing, totaling about 2,000 people. They looted Sian Town the day before yesterday and occupied it. The stationed military police were too weak to resist, resulting in significant losses. Subsequently, the Second Regiment of the Security Brigade dispatched troops to fiercely suppress them, engaging in fierce battles all day. On the night of the 15th, Sian was recaptured, and the bandits fled into Anhui Province. The Hangzhou Regiment Commander sent a lengthy telegram to the province yesterday.</p>

<p>Fierce Battle between Soldiers and Bandits in Shan'ao: On the evening of the 14th, at about 10 p.m., seventeen or eighteen bandits suddenly arrived at the home of He Caizhao in Shan'ao, Eastern Township. All were armed with wooden-holstered guns, broke down the main door, and rushed upstairs, engaging in unrestrained looting. Caizhao's cousin, Caifeng, lived across from his younger brother, Wangheng. Hearing the commotion inside his brother's house and the bandits firing their guns outside the door as a show of force, he realized something was amiss and escaped through the back door, running to Yonghe Market, about a mile from the village. He reported to the County Defense Team and Anti-Smuggling Team stationed there, requesting their assistance. By the time the soldiers arrived at Shan'ao, the bandits had moved from He Caizhao's house into Caifeng's residence. The soldiers then opened fire, and the bandits returned fire, resulting in a fierce battle lasting over ten minutes. The bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, fled towards Qingxian Ridge and Fengding Gang. In this incident, He Caizhao's house was looted of clothing and gold rings and hairpins deposited by his cousin Haichao, totaling over 300 yuan in losses. Because the soldiers arrived at He Caifeng's house before it could be looted, it was spared from damage. The victim has already filed a loss report on the 15th, requesting the county government to conduct an on-site investigation and dispatch additional troops to be stationed there to maintain order.</p>

<p>Guild Merchants Telegram Requesting Exemption from Construction Bond Allocation: All the salt merchants in Eastern Zhejiang, due to insufficient ability to raise construction bonds, telegraphed the Zhejiang Salt Transport Commissioner on the 15th, stating that upon receiving the Commissioner's letter ordering the Zhejiang salt merchants to subscribe to 800,000 yuan of Zhejiang Province construction bonds, they were extremely alarmed. In recent years, salt sales have been sluggish, and public bonds have been paid in installments, resulting in heavy debts and no access to loans. The Commissioner is fully aware of the merchants' various hardships. Therefore, they earnestly request the Commissioner to show compassion for the merchants' difficulties and relay to the Chairman a request for exemption. They also ask a wealthy merchant in Shanghai to explain the situation of Shaoxing merchants' impoverishment and lack of access to loans to Chairman Zhang and request him to consider the merchants' difficulties and allow for a change, exempting them from the allocation.</p>

<p>▲ Chairman Chiang's Speech</p>
<p>At the start of the meeting, Chairman Chiang entered the venue in casual clothes and ascended the podium. Minister Jiang announced the opening of the meeting and invited Chairman Jiang of the National Government to deliver a speech, as follows:</p>
<p>"I am very honored to participate in the second National Education Conference today. I do not have much research on education and dare not contribute much to everyone. However, I personally have many feelings about domestic education recently, so I will share them with you.</p>
<p>(1) The work of the National Revolution has not yet been completed, and its greatest foundation is actually education. If this foundation is not solid, the danger is very great. Therefore, Chinese education should be reformed and perfected as soon as possible, so that the general youth can stand under the Three Principles of the People and work together. There are many bad trends in the country today, and it is up to us to reform them through revolutionary means. Since the May Fourth Movement, revolutionary comrades have paid more attention to destruction and not enough to construction. This is due to time constraints and not choosing means. There are indeed unavoidable difficulties. Although the era of destruction has passed, the academic atmosphere in the country is still bad. This is the result of today's education, and the bad results cannot be said to be the fruit planted in the past. Because the National Revolution must succeed, it is important to study how to implement and build education in the revolutionary process. What time is it now? The time for destruction has passed. If we re-implement education of a destructive nature, it will definitely fail. Education of a constructive nature must take order as a prerequisite. When the Premier went north in the 24th year of the Republic of China, he gave a speech to the Huangpu students, speaking for two hours. The main idea was that party members have no freedom, students have no freedom, so the Premier absolutely does not advocate that students have freedom. I believe that all the bad situations in China today must be blamed on the excessive freedom of students. The effectiveness of education cannot be seen in a day. It can only be seen after ten or twenty years. There is an ancient Chinese saying, 'It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people,' which is a famous saying. Today's education should bear the responsibility for the survival of the nation. Therefore, the principals of various universities and the directors of education departments in various provinces bear a heavy burden, directly and indirectly related to the survival and urgency of the country. We must bear this responsibility to engage in education. The first step is to rectify the academic atmosphere, so that the previous romantic and chaotic phenomena can be swept away, so that the country's century-long plan can be determined. If education can earnestly rectify the academic atmosphere, no matter what resistance there is, the Party Headquarters and the government will support it at all costs, even sacrificing lives. Otherwise, the Chinese academic atmosphere will never be rectified. I hope that the education authorities in various provinces will pay more attention to this kind of revolutionary spirit, to revive the Chinese national spirit and rectify the Chinese academic atmosphere today.</p>
<p>(2) China is an economically backward country and must not imitate foreign countries. It should create an independent education to suit the current national conditions. China is an agricultural country, so agricultural education is the fundamental plan for saving the country and is more important than any other education. We should not regard establishing the country with agriculture as an old saying. In my opinion, agricultural education must be promoted in any case. If it can be realized, there will be results in five or ten years. Only agricultural education can save our Chinese country and realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. Its effectiveness should be above industrial education and commercial education.</p>
<p>(3) The thoughts of young people must also be unified. Therefore, we should pay close attention to party ideology education. It would be a good way for principals of schools at all levels to take charge of party ideology courses to guide the thoughts of young people. Because the principal is a figure of faith in a school, we must rely on the Three Principles of the People to unify political stability and ideological stability. The education inspectors of the education departments of various provinces must pay attention to how the Party ideology education is implemented in various schools. Not only is this what I personally hope for, but also what the comrades of our party deeply hope for."</p>
<p>▲ Conference Implements Preliminary Plans for Compulsory Education</p>
<p>After a ten-minute break, the bell rang to start the meeting. Speaker Jiang read Article 10 of the revised original text of this plan and asked members to discuss it. (1) Zhu Jingnong first said that the revised text has a wider scope than the original text, so it is more perfect. (2) Zhuang Zexuan said that this series is a formal method, and all words like "discretionary change" should be cancelled. (3) Zhu Jingnong continued that the word "change" is used to make activities such as holidays for rural schools and making up for missed lessons for children (4) Zhang Honglie once said that shortening and changing are not the same thing and must be noted. (5) Peng Qingpeng proposed that the amendment should be revised again and the "discretionary shortening" should be deleted, which was seconded by Xu Jifu and the motion was passed. (6) Liao Shicheng said that the two words "change" can still be used because it is convenient for children to study in actual situations. (7) Zhao Naifu said that the original amendment has no major problems, and the word "shorten" can be changed to "extend". (8) Li Quanshi said that the word "shorten" should be cancelled, and "discretionary change" should be used during the school period. During the vote, those who agreed with the amendment by the review committee and the proposal by the members, "But for children who cannot continue to study for four years, they can make discretionary changes," were passed by a majority.</p>

<p>▲ Miscellaneous Conference News</p>
<p>▲ Education Experts Busy Giving Speeches: This National Education Conference is being held in Beijing, and education experts from various provinces have gathered. The schools in Beijing, considering this a rare opportunity, have invited experts to give speeches at their schools, making them very busy.</p>
<p>▲ Publications Given to Representatives by Beijing Girls' Middle and Elementary Schools: In order to welcome the representatives of the National Education Conference and make it convenient for them to visit the school, the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Girls' Middle School Experimental Elementary School specially printed a brief overview of the school's current situation, with an attached overview of the capital's famous scenic spots, with brief explanations of all the famous historical sites in Beijing for representatives to visit. Each member received a copy, which they praised for making sightseeing convenient.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Schools Preparing for Welcome: The Nanjing Special Municipal Schools held a meeting of the principals of municipal schools at the Municipal Education Bureau today (17th) to discuss the welcome party for the representatives of various provinces.</p>
<p>▲ Statistics on Members' Attire: About 70% wear glasses, about 30% wear suits, about 10% wear mandarin jackets, and about 10% wear Sun Yat-sen suits and student uniforms. One person wore a military uniform with a armed belt.</p>
<p>▲ Gender Statistics: There are 100 men and 3 women in the member seating, and 26 men and 4 women in the audience seating.</p>
<p>▲ Many Printed Materials Distributed: At the conference venue, printed materials are distributed every day, such as the general education situation of various provinces and cities, educational works of various schools, and work reports of various organs of the National Government, which are colorful, of various sizes, and very interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Focus of the Conference Discussion is on Teacher Training <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The focus of the conference discussion is on the independence and merger of normal schools. The first National Education Conference decided that the principle of normal schools and middle schools is to be qualified. In this reform plan for national education, it was decided that normal schools that have been merged with middle schools should be gradually separated within the possible scope, considering local conditions. This provision has tended towards the advocacy of independent normal schools. Members are now divided into two factions: one advocates independent normal schools, and the other advocates the joint school of middle schools and normal schools. There will definitely be a big dispute during future discussions. Judging from the current attending members, the majority advocates independence. It is expected that this case will be a point of contention at the general assembly in the coming days. Experts, education directors from various provinces, and all parties in the education sector attach great importance to the issue of joint schools for middle schools and normal schools. It is expected that a debate on the conference floor will be one of the most exciting scenes of this conference.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Committee Review Meetings <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲ Second Review Meeting of the Elementary Education Group</p>
<p>▲ Original Plan Slightly Modified</p>
<p>The Second Review Meeting of the Elementary Education Group was attended by committee members Chen Heqin, Yu Ziyi, Wu Yan Yin, Nie Tiren, Xu Shou, and Zhang Honglie, with Zhao Yuren from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education attending as an observer. The outcome was general approval of the original plan, with slight modifications to several items. The two main points are: (1) The original plan only listed kindergartens under the item of early childhood education. Now it is changed to early childhood education, which should be divided into two types: 1. Kindergartens, 2. Infant care centers. (2) The original plan was missing an item on special education. The review result is that special education should be included, divided into classes for gifted children, classes for children with learning disabilities, and schools for the disabled.</p>
<p>▲ Second Review Meeting of the Overseas Chinese Education Group</p>
<p>▲ Three Important Points</p>
<p>The Second Review Meeting of the Overseas Chinese Education Group was attended by seven members: Zhong Rongguang, Zheng Hongnian, Zhuang Zexuan, Zhao Naichuan, Qian He, Liu Shimu, and Zhu Baoqin. Zheng Hongnian chaired the meeting, and Zhu Baoqin was the recorder. (1) When poor overseas Chinese students return to China and enter national or provincial schools, they may be granted tuition waivers at the discretion of the school upon presentation of proof from an overseas Chinese organization. (2) Funding standards need not follow domestic school regulations to accommodate special circumstances. (3) The summary should be reported to the General Assembly. There are three important points: 1. Request the Ministry of Education to immediately send personnel to inspect the status of overseas Chinese education in various regions, and pay special attention to the selection of inspectors. 2. When inspectors from the Ministry of Education arrive in various regions for inspection, they should work with local overseas Chinese to quickly establish overseas Chinese education associations, paying special attention to the location of the associations. 3. The Overseas Chinese Education Design Committee should be established as soon as possible to solicit opinions from overseas Chinese education associations in various regions and allocate subsidies.</p>
<p>▲ First Review Meeting of the Social Education Group</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, the Social Education Group held its first review meeting in Room 102 of the Central Hotel. The review committee members present were Cai Yuanpei, Lei Peihong, Song Binggong, Duanmu Kai, Chen Zhengmo, Peng Baichuan, Chen Chuangxiu, Liu Zhanen, Yu Qingtang, Jiang Ji, Tang Maoru, Ma Bingkui, and Chen Hexian, totaling thirteen people.

Take public education centers and farmer education centers as the center of implementation and experimentation. All libraries, gymnasiums, exhibition halls, lecture halls, etc., should be integrated with public education centers and farmer education centers within the possible range. 2. To train talent, social education departments should be established in normal universities and education colleges of various universities, and provincial education departments should establish social education colleges or public education institutes, as appropriate. 3. Ordinary advanced public schools should be divided into two types: public schools with advanced classes and youth supplementary schools. 4. Industrial and commercial supplementary schools should promote joint management by factories, shops, or other industrial and commercial education institutions in accordance with the Outline of the Workers' Education Plan. Agricultural supplementary schools should be jointly managed by agricultural extension committees, agricultural instructors, or farmer education institutions in accordance with agricultural extension regulations. 5. Literacy training, civic training, and vocational training can be carried out simultaneously in areas with sufficient financial resources, depending on actual circumstances.</p>
<p>▲ Joint Meeting of the Compulsory Education and Teacher Training Groups</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the Compulsory Education Group and the Teacher Training Group held a joint meeting in Room 251 of the Central Hotel. More than twenty people, including Zhu Jingnong, attended. Zhang Honglie chaired the meeting, and Sun Huiqing was the secretary. The resolutions are as follows: 1. The six-year rural normal schools equivalent to secondary school level in the original plan will remain as they are. 2. The rural normal school specialties at or above the high school level in the original plan will be changed to rural normal school teachers. Departments or programs can be set up in university education colleges or normal universities, or specialized rural normal colleges can be established for training, with at least one in each county.</p>
<p>▲ Review Report of the Compulsory Education Group</p>
<p>The group chairman, Zhang Honglie, reported on the proceedings of the previous day and the results of the review, with a total of three revisions. The revised text is listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Objectives: The objective of this plan is to enable school-age children nationwide to receive four years of elementary school education. However, children who cannot continue for four years may be given appropriate accommodations (Note 1), or the duration of their schooling may be shortened (Note 2), and supplementary schools (Note 3) or a "self-study system" (Note 4) may be used to supplement their compulsory education.</p>
<p>(2) Time Limit: It is planned to complete the establishment of teacher training institutions nationwide within five years, and to open 1,500 compulsory education experimental areas in cities and villages during the same period (Note 5), so that all important counties nationwide can start small-scale experiments on compulsory education, which will be gradually promoted year by year until the end of the twentieth year. However, education administrative officers of various provinces and cities may shorten the time limit and complete the work ahead of schedule, depending on local conditions.</p>

<p>Lu Dianyang proposed that if the 20-year period is changed to 10 years, problems will arise with teacher training and funding, and it will not be in accordance with the budget plan, so it is appropriate to maintain the original plan and add "(Education administrative officers of various provinces and cities) may implement compulsory education ahead of schedule depending on local conditions." Hu Shuhua seconded the motion, and the motion was passed. Yu Ziyi said that if compulsory education is changed to 10 years, the financial budget will have to bear additional burdens every year, which will cause problems for the national economy. Therefore, it is appropriate to maintain the original plan and add Lu Dianyang's amendment, and special attention should be paid to local wealth. Wei Tingsheng said that the national economic strength has improved more than before, so funding problems may not be difficult. In my opinion, the teacher problem may be more difficult. It is not easy to cultivate teachers in remote areas, so solving the teacher problem cannot be completed in five or six years. Therefore, I still agree with Mr. Lu Dianyang's proposal to consider local conditions and not to raise the issue of teacher training and wealth. Lu Dianyang continued to say that the motivation for the proposal was due to the difficulty in the revision of the review group regarding speeding up things. Therefore, Wang Zhangwei's original plan was approved by the majority.</p>
<p>(3) (Note 6) The former University Council issued a survey form in 1928 to the education administrative authorities of various provinces and cities, detailing the number of school-age children. The original deadline for reporting was the end of 1928, but at that time, the Northern Expedition had just been successfully completed, and the military operations had not ended for long. Many provinces and cities delayed or did not handle the survey of school-age children. As of September 1929, only Nanjing Special City had reported the exact number of school-age children to the Ministry. The remaining provinces and cities did not report accurate figures. Therefore, the number of school-age children nationwide can only be estimated based on the approximate population of the country. In European and American countries, approximately one in six people is a school-age child, but the "school-age period" for children in China is temporarily set from six to twelve years old. If necessary, it can be extended to fifteen years old. The period is shorter than that of Europe and the United States, and compulsory education is also temporarily targeted at "enabling school-age children nationwide to receive four years of elementary school education." Therefore, the number can be further reduced. It is now tentatively assumed that one in ten people is a school-age child who should receive compulsory education.</p>
<p>Huang Jianzhong said that the amendment "(may be extended to fifteen years if necessary)" should not be added and should be deleted. Chen Jian said that the amendment to Note 6 conflicted with the original text of Note 2, so the original plan should be maintained. When it was put to a vote, the majority supported maintaining the original plan, which was passed. Speaker Jiang asked whether this case was passed as a whole. Meng Xiancheng said that issues related to teacher training had not yet been discussed, so it could not be considered to be passed as a whole. Zhu Jingnong proposed that this case should reserve the two points of teacher training funding budget, and the rest should be passed. When it was put to a vote, the majority supported Zhu Jingnong's proposal, which was passed. Zhang Honglie, Director of the Henan Education Department, Photo by Guanghua.</p>
<p>▲ Review Report of the Adult Supplementary Education Group</p>
<p>The group held a review meeting from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 16th of this month. The attendees were Wu Jingheng, Li Zheng, Lei Peihong, Tang Maoru, Liu Zhanen, Chen Jian, Gu Shusen, Yu Qingtang, Zhong Lingxiu, and Sun Zuosu. Yu Qingtang was elected as the chairman, and Tang Maoru was elected as the secretary. The plan was generally approved, with slight modifications to the name, objectives, etc. as listed below:</p>
<p>1. The name is changed to Preliminary Plan for Implementing Public Supplementary Education. Wherever the term "adult supplementary education" appears in the full text, it is uniformly changed to "public supplementary education."</p>
<p>2. In the second and third sentences of the objective, after "public (originally adult) supplementary education," it is changed to "encompassing literacy training, civic training, and vocational training." This plan is a preliminary plan. It is planned to complete the major tasks of literacy training and civic training as soon as possible in the six years of political tutelage. The rest remains the same as the original. Wherever the term "national literacy training" appears in the full text, the word "national" is deleted.</p>
<p>3. Principles: A. Changed to: "Literacy training and civic training should enable the general public to become literate, read, and have the ability to exercise the four powers with the least amount of money and the shortest amount of time." B. The first sentence is changed to: "Literacy training and civic training..." The rest remains the same as the original. C. Changed to: "The age of those receiving literacy training and civic training should start from twelve years old up to fifty years old and above." D. Changed to: "The implementation of literacy training and civic training should have very precise assessments." E. Changed to: "After the foundation of literacy training and civic training has been laid, there should be opportunities for continued progress." F. The word "national" in the original Item D is still deleted.</p>
<p>4. Current Urgent Issues: In Item A, the word "purpose" in the third line is probably a mistake for "number." In the second line of the fourth page, the phrase "can count and use the four powers" is added.</p>
<p>5. In Item 4, "out-of-school adults" is changed to "out-of-school public." In Item A, "national literacy schools" is changed to "public schools," and "national literacy centers" is changed to "public literacy centers." Wherever the term "national literacy schools" appears in the full text, it is changed to "public schools," and "national literacy centers" is changed to "public literacy centers." In the original Item B, the four sentences from "evaluated by the nearby elementary school principal" to "to the nearby elementary school principal" are all deleted. Item C is changed to: "For the purpose of training teachers for public schools in various counties and cities, provinces may establish institutions for training teachers for public supplementary education." D. "Public schools in each county may establish specialized training schools or attach classes to the county's senior elementary schools, county normal schools, provincial normal schools, high school normal departments, and secondary schools or above to train all students of the school and recruit private school teachers to add training, which can be applied forcibly. These teacher sources are estimated as follows: 1. Teachers trained by special schools (Note) 957,500 people; 2. If the above item cannot be fully realized, it shall be supplemented by the following two items: (1) Students in secondary schools or above: 220,000; (2) Private school teachers: 200,000. If provinces and counties have difficulties in implementation, they may apply to the competent authority for handling." E. "Teachers of public literacy centers are filled by literate people from their own homes, shops, and institutions. It is estimated that there are 80 million such teachers. Each teacher teaches two people, and 160 million people can be trained in four months." F. In the original Item E, the word "national" is changed to "public." The two sentences "After graduation, they will be successively sent to various provinces for long-term guidance and be responsible for evaluating performance" are changed to "After graduation, they will be successively sent to various provinces to be responsible for long-term guidance and inspection." Also, the word "very" in the last sentence is changed to "more." 5. Add measures for school building equipment. Wherever there is the term "national," it is changed to "public." The three words "simple" in the last sentence are deleted. 6. Funding budget and distribution: First, the estimated budget for funding is approximately 283.4 million yuan. Expenses for training teachers in provinces, cities, and counties should be added. Also, the word "number" in this figure is probably a mistake for the character "item." The first and second sentences under the description of the first item are changed to "It is assumed that except for one-sixth of the people who cannot afford to contribute books, the rest will purchase them themselves." The rest remains the same as the original. In the first sentence under the term "Stationery expenses," it is changed to "It is assumed that except for one-third, who cannot afford to purchase it, the rest will purchase it themselves." The rest remains the same as the original. In the budget table on page 8, item 6 is changed to "Expenses for training public supplementary education teachers in various provinces."</p>
<p>First item: Opening expenses: 28,000 yuan (Opening expenses: each province needs a total of 13,000 yuan. If half of the 28 provinces in the country, i.e., 14 provinces, are calculated, the annual average needed for the above number within six years). Second item: Recurring expenses: 168,000 yuan (Recurring expenses: 12,000 yuan per province. If half of the 28 provinces in the country, i.e., 14 provinces, are calculated, each province needs the above number in total within six years. Item 7: Expenses for training public school teachers in various counties and cities. First item: Opening expenses: 400,000 yuan (Opening expenses: 400 yuan per county. If approximately 2,000 cities and counties nationwide are calculated by half, i.e., 1,000 counties, the annual average of the above number within six years). Second item: Recurring expenses: 5,000,000 yuan (Approximately 2,000 cities and counties nationwide are calculated by half, i.e., 1,000 counties, 5,000 yuan per county, the annual average of the above number within six years). The original Item 7 is changed to Item 8. Item 8 is changed to Item 9. 7. Editing of national literacy teaching materials. The original term "national" is changed to "public."

Third: The original Article 4 is changed to this article, and the original Article 3 is deleted. Fourth: "The textbook series, etc. compiled in the preceding article shall be annotated with phonetic symbols." Fifth: Same as the original.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Academia Sinica Receives Members <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>▲ President Cai's Speech ▲ Jin Zecheng's Response</p>
<p>Academia Sinica hosted a reception for its members at 5:00 PM on the 17th, specially inviting all members to visit the Meteorological Observatory. The Secretary-General, Yang Xingfo, Secretary Xu Jifu, and staff of the Academy guided the visit. This is the old site of the Taipei Observatory, and the architecture is very grand, and the equipment is also plentiful. A library is now under construction behind the observatory and work has already begun. After the visit, they went to Jiming Temple. President Cai had already arrived and personally welcomed them. At 6:00 PM, a banquet was held at Huomeng Building. More than one hundred members attended, and guests included Wu Zhihui and Li Shishi. During the banquet, Cai gave a speech, briefly saying that it was a great pleasure to invite all teaching members here today. The relationship between Academia Sinica and education is very close. The Academy is in its initial stage, and the existing research institutes, such as meteorology, astronomy, geology, natural history, physics, chemistry, and industry, are mostly in the field of natural sciences. The number of social sciences is very small. There is currently only one social research institute, which is divided into legal, economic, and social groups. Because research institutes in practical subjects are relatively easy to establish, as long as there are a few researchers and some instruments, research can be carried out. The Academy is established by the state, and its nature is different from that of the university's research institute. The university's research institute is designed to train university graduates for more in-depth knowledge. The nature of the Academy is to allow scholars to have a free research opportunity according to their interests, and sometimes choose a few practical problems for research, providing reference for various social, political, and educational undertakings. The Academy originally had a plan to set up an educational research institute, because the scope of this research institute is very broad, and the talent, of course, cannot be done by a few people. In terms of equipment, it cannot be done with some instruments. A laboratory must have various experimental schools as its research place, and the required funding is also very large, so it cannot be started. Now the Ministry of Education has a plan to set up an educational research institute, hoping to cooperate with the Academy, and the Academy expresses its approval. I am very happy to have you here today. Please raise a glass of light wine to wish you good health and to wish the national education progress. Then, Jin Zecheng, the representative of Guangdong, was elected by the members to give a reply. Jin Jun once served as the Dean of the Former University Council and once worked with President Cai to plan the establishment of various research projects. The reply was very sincere, briefly saying: I am very grateful to President Cai for hosting colleagues today. We deeply know that President Cai advocated the establishment of Academia Sinica when he was at the University Council. When it was established, although there was no foundation, today, due to proper management, several research institutes have been established, and branches have been set up in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. This kind of academic construction is very common in Eastern and Western countries, but in China, it can be regarded as a new construction. I feel that Nanjing in the past few years and Nanjing today have made a lot of progress. For example, Beijige was dilapidated before, but now it has built an astronomical observatory, and other constructions are also numerous. Academia Sinica is an organization for scientific construction and academic construction and is closely related to the education sector. More than a dozen of China's education sectors have not seen progress, which is due to the lack of scientific and academic construction. Now the President is doing this matter, and there will be great construction in science and academics. Colleagues deeply hope that President Cai will expand this construction to other provinces, and colleagues will be very grateful. Colleagues also know that President Cai has a good capacity for alcohol, so please all gentlemen raise a glass together to wish President Cai good health.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Zhuang Zexuan's Important Remarks <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>▲ Education Plan Pays Little Attention to Vocational Training</p>
<p>▲ Expert Academics are Different from Administration</p>
<p>Member Zhuang is an expert member invited by the General Assembly. He also attended the first National Education Conference and will give a speech at this General Assembly. 1. In the entire education improvement plan, vocational education seems to be given little attention. 2. For compulsory education, he advocates starting from the age of ten. 3. Education administrators are replaced too quickly. None of the education directors of the various provinces who attended the first conference are still in office. The lack of security for administrative personnel attending this conference is quite shocking. However, many of the experts attending are still old people, which shows that academics and administration are ultimately different.</p>

<p>▲ Will Propose Restoration of Freedom</p>
<p>It is heard that the majority of members are very indignant about the groundless arrest of Cheng Shixuan, Director of the Fujian Education Department, who has not yet been released. They will propose a temporary motion at the end of the General Assembly to request the central government to quickly restore Cheng's freedom to protect human rights.</p>

<p>National Scout General Review</p>
<p>The First National Scout General Review and Grand Jamboree will open today in Xiaoying, the capital. The General Assembly believes that this matter is of great importance, so it has specially stopped the meeting so that all members can go to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Word of an Extended Conference Period <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>This morning, due to participation in the Scout review, the original review meeting was moved to the afternoon. The Ministry of Education is concerned that the stipulated General Assembly period is too short to discuss all the plans, so there is a rumor that the conference period will be extended by one day to close on the 23rd.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Complete Plan (6) <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>7 Moral Education</p>
<p>First, the standards for moral education should be stipulated by the Ministry of Education based on the educational purpose and the educational development of children's native place determined by the political program, by grade in elementary schools and kindergartens.</p>
<p>Second, the objectives of moral education stipulated by the Ministry of Education should focus on unity. The first step should be to hire experts to first set the objectives, and then analyze the objectives into several detailed items that conform to each action of a person or become each habit. The second step is to rank them in order of difficulty of development and estimate the value of each item to be developed in each grade. The third step is to ask experienced and excellent teachers across the country to evaluate their value (either by grade or by quantity). The fourth step is to statistically analyze the results of the third step and rearrange the additions and subtractions. The fifth step is to compile usage methods and add examples of several implementation methods and performance evaluation methods, etc. The sixth step is to print and publish it and order it as the national elementary education moral education standard.</p>
<p>Third, the Education Department of each province should investigate special needs in the social customs of the province, increase supplementary items and implementation methods based on the moral education standards set by the Ministry of Education, and submit them to the Ministry of Education for implementation. The procedure for ordering should refer to the previous article.</p>
<p>Fourth, each city and county should formulate moral education matters and implementation methods for each year, month, and week based on national and provincial standards, and with reference to the special needs of the local area, and submit them to the Education Department for implementation. The procedure for ordering should refer to the previous article.</p>
<p>Fifth, the detailed items, matters, and implementation methods stipulated in the preceding three articles should include the entire life of students. All aspects of training students' autonomy, actively developing good habits, correcting special bad habits, using extracurricular activities, contacting families, guiding students to assist family work, and developing discipline in daily life, and the standards and methods for assessing character should be taken into account. In particular, elementary school students should be immersed in the cultivation of the Three Principles of the People from an early age.</p>
<p>Sixth, the methods for guiding practice and assessing performance must be precisely stipulated in order to implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Seventh, elementary schools that fail to organize party scouts do not need to wear uniforms. If the student's family can afford to have the elementary school students wear uniforms, foreign raw materials must not be used. Party scout clothing and supplies should be limited to domestic goods, except for unavoidable foreign goods such as camera lenses.</p>
<p>Eighth, the style of elementary school uniforms can be determined by the Education Department of each province based on local conditions, and cheap and easy-to-make styles can be submitted to the Ministry of Education for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e106">8 Expenses <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>First, elementary schools and kindergartens should not charge tuition fees as a principle. In places where life is prosperous, fees may be charged at the discretion of the school. The amount of fees should be from one jiao to one yuan per semester, and each city and county should formulate separate regulations for each elementary school and kindergarten based on the local living conditions, and submit them to the higher-level education administrative organs for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Second, in elementary schools and kindergartens that charge fees, free places should still be provided for poor students.</p>
<p>Third, elementary schools and kindergartens that charge fees should not have discriminatory treatment for fee-paying students and free students, and should not use fee-paying and free as a basis for class division.</p>
<p>Fourth, the tuition revenue of elementary schools and kindergartens in each province, city, and county shall not be listed as recurring expenses, but should be used for special accounting and deposited, and used exclusively for the improvement and expansion of elementary schools in each city and county that are not well-equipped, or for special subsidies to poor students.</p>
<p>Fifth, elementary schools and kindergartens must not collect miscellaneous fees from students. If the elementary school and kindergarten acts as an agent for students in consuming goods such as paper, pens, notebooks, work materials, and experimental drugs, it may stipulate a compromise number and submit it to the competent education administrative organ to collect from students. If there is a surplus, it shall be submitted to the competent education administrative organ and used separately for the improvement and expansion of the equipment of each elementary school and kindergarten.</p>
<p>Sixth, except for special circumstances and prior submission to the competent education administrative authorities for temporary fundraising from student families for books, construction, etc., students must not be charged long-term reading fees, sports fees, construction fees, etc.</p>
<p>Seventh, party scouts' personal items are provided by the students themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Nine Courses <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>First, when the trial period of the provisional curriculum standards expires, the Ministry of Education should, based on the results of the trial, revise and compile them into formal curriculum standards. At the same time, based on these standards, it should formulate editing standards for textbooks, teaching books, reference books, and self-study books. It should also compile and print model textbooks, prepare wall charts, and manufacture suitable teaching aids to serve as models for merchants to imitate.</p>
<p>Second, each provincial education department should, based on the curriculum standards, investigate the local conditions of each place in its province, formulate curricula. When formulating, a committee may be organized to handle it. The organizational outline of the committee shall be promulgated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Third, the content of the primary school curriculum should be formulated in detail according to the provisions of the primary school curriculum standards. However, it may not be divided into subjects, but take designed activities as the warp and the teaching materials of each subject as the weft, arranged in sequence, in order to apply. The content items can be divided into "objectives," "activities," and "achievement limits," and can be supplemented with "time allocation," "teaching examples," etc. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Objectives: Define the various things that should be strived for in each grade or stage in a specific and itemized manner as objectives, to serve as a guide for teachers to guide children's learning. The compilation method can be to first mix the original subject objectives of the primary school curriculum standards, and then specifically analyze them and list them as several items, separately compiled as the objectives of a certain year or each stage.</p>
<p>2. Activities: Similar to the objectives, specify the various activities of each grade or stage item by item. The compilation method can be based on the original "task requirements for each academic year" of each subject in the primary school curriculum standards, linking, mixing, and analyzing them into several designed activities containing specific teaching materials, separately compiled as the activity items of a certain year or stage. The most important thing to pay attention to in this item is that all abstract standards mentioned in the curriculum standards, such as "local...", "daily...", "main...", etc., should be specifically defined as specific teaching materials.</p>
<p>3. Achievement Limits: Also specify separately by grade or stage. The compilation method should be in accordance with the original standard of "minimum limit," taking into account local conditions, and defining it as the achievement limit for a certain year or stage.</p>
<p>4. Time Allocation: The determined number of hours and time arrangement methods adopted in this district can be specified for schools to follow.</p>
<p>5. Teaching Examples: Specify various teaching examples separately by grade or stage for teachers to refer to. Detailed records of reference books, teaching aids, and their usage, experimental methods, and test examination methods should also be included.</p>

<h3 id="e109">▲Advocating the Abolition of Graduation School Exams and Replacing Them with Unified Examinations <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Wu Yourong, Representative of Overseas Chinese from Taiwan</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to all Provincial Education Directors, Municipal and County Education Bureau Directors, and National Education Experts by the Shanghai Shen Bao: Yesterday, I submitted a petition to Chairman Jiang Wenri of the National Education Conference, stating the disadvantages of graduation school exams and the reasons for replacing them with unified examinations. I am offering my humble opinions, hoping that they will be submitted to the conference for public resolution and implementation. I believe that the graduation examinations of schools at all levels in our country have always been held by the schools themselves, which is called the school exam system. As time goes on, the disadvantages have become more and more serious, and the original purpose of education has been gradually lost. Now that the period of political tutelage has just begun, it seems that reforms should be carried out to seek renewal. I, Wu Yourong, dare to offer my humble opinions and present the reasons to the conference for review. Our country has been promoting new education for nearly thirty years, and schools have sprung up everywhere. Education at all levels seems to be developing, but when one examines its content, there are very few who are both excellent in teaching and learning and outstanding in performance, while the majority are just empty signs and perfunctory. What is even worse is that some people run schools for profit and sell diplomas. Those who seek knowledge do so with the diploma as the goal. Teachers and students deceive each other, regardless of their own intelligence, completely losing the meaning of education. This is the first disadvantage of the school exam system. Education at all levels is the foundation for building a society and a country. If graduation is granted indiscriminately without corresponding restrictions, then after graduation, it will not be able to connect with the education at the time of enrollment, or adapt to the needs of society. The graduates will be unable to distinguish between fish and pork, and will be incompetent in any skill. Parents often turn to private schools because their graduated children lack the ability to enter higher education and make a living, or change careers halfway. There are even those in society who see schools as factories for manufacturing vagrants. The belief in new education has completely fallen. This is the second disadvantage of the school exam system. Education at all levels is a factory for shaping the character, intelligence, and physique of young people. If there is no accurate standard, and graduation is granted indiscriminately when the time limit is reached, then under this system, the excellent do not need to work hard, and the inferior have no motivation to improve. Even those who are in charge of education cannot avoid being trapped in the habit of laziness and perfunctoriness. The mechanism for cultivating talents has become a trap for causing harm. If this continues, education will inevitably go bankrupt. This is the third disadvantage of the school exam system. Now, if we want to eliminate the above-mentioned harms, we can only follow the principle of examination advocated by the Premier, order schools at all levels across the country to prepare a list of students who should take the graduation examination, affix photos, and submit them to the county, provincial, and central education authorities for review. Then, the authorities will convene relevant agencies to jointly hire those who are excellent in character and learning and who are deeply familiar with the curriculum standards and educational principles to organize graduation unified examination committees at all levels of schools to hold graduation unified examinations. In this way, the harms can be eliminated, and the benefits are threefold. First, the educational advocacy of our Party can be realized. Reading the declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, one says that in view of the current situation in China, culture is backward, the economy is backward, and the people's physical and mental health are all weak. The only hope lies in the youth who are rising up. The second says that popularizing national education and raising the people's knowledge to create healthy citizens is the foundation for building the country. The so-called youth who are rising up and the so-called national education refer to the students of today. It is undeniable that education at all levels in our country is not perfect, and students are not receiving perfect education. If we do not invigorate it, then raising the people's knowledge will be empty talk, and the youth who are the only hope will be disappointed. If unified examinations are implemented, then teaching and learning will encourage each other, the level will be comparable, graduation will not be indiscriminate, and our Party's educational advocacy of raising the people's knowledge and creating healthy citizens can be realized. Second, the national education achievements can be accurately investigated. Education at all levels is the foundation for building a healthy society and country. This is the fundamental proposition of our Party to save the country. Those who are responsible for educational administration are all eager to examine it in detail to encourage them. However, the only method of examination is to send supervisors or special commissioners to conduct strict inspections and report the facts. But the inspection time of supervisors and special commissioners is very short, and it is difficult to know all the content. Moreover, the preparations and decorations of both teaching and learning parties have changed their usual attitude. Therefore, what the supervisors and special commissioners can inspect and report may not all be the usual and true achievements. In case the supervisors and special commissioners are not suitable, there is also the malpractice of soliciting and reversing. If unified examinations are implemented, the authenticity of students' achievements, the comparison of school subjects, and the merits and demerits of the heads of each subject can be truly reflected in the unified examination. Based on this, strict rewards and punishments will be imposed, and both teaching and learning parties will feel that there is no escape, and they will all be vigilant and know to work hard. This will not only improve the level, but also tend to be true and consistent. As a result, education at all levels can achieve good results, and a healthy society and country can be built. Third, education policies can be effectively implemented. Educational policies are to respond to the trends of the times and promote the transformation of society. The importance of their relationship is self-evident. If the graduation unified examination is implemented, and the student's achievement, whether it meets the spirit of the policy, is used as the standard for graduation and retention, and as the evaluation of the merits and demerits of the school, then teachers and students will not dare to regard the policy as a mere formality. It will be seen that the competent authority and the school authorities are united, and every policy decision will be an order in the morning and a fact in the evening. This can eliminate the previous malpractices of numbness and indifference, and create a very dynamic and organic group. As said before, the harms are like that, and as said later, the benefits are like this. Therefore, I, Wu Yourong, at the end of the sixteenth year, tried out the graduation unified examination of primary schools in Liancheng County, Fujian, and the results were very effective. In the seventeenth year, no less than twenty counties in Fujian Province followed suit. According to the reports of various counties, they all believed that it was a good way to improve education. The students, their parents, and all sectors of society praised it, and they deeply believed in and admired the graduates who had already taken the unified examination. Even the students were all very happy, thinking that from now on, our new education can wash away the shame of the past that all graduates passed without any ability. I, Wu Yourong, have gone from ideal to belief in graduation unified examinations, from belief to trial, and from trial to good results, and have vigorously promoted them, from one county to more than twenty counties. I hope that after this conference, you will pay special attention to the graduation unified examination, and I urge you to implement the unified examination for the students who should take the graduation examination at the end of the eighteenth year, and continue to carry it out from now on. After ten years of strict examination, education at all levels will surely be</p>

<h3 id="e110">Henan Education Plan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<h3 id="e111">▲Zhang Honglie, Director of Henan Education Department <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>I originally intended to make a very detailed plan for education in Henan, seeking correction from educators. Unfortunately, the political changes were so hurried that the drafts were not completed, which is a regret. Now, I will briefly explain the general idea.</p>
<p>(1) Higher Education: Since 1927, Henan Zhongshan University has opened five departments of liberal arts, science, agriculture, law, and medicine. The number of students in the five departments has reached more than 900, and the funding has reached 370,000 yuan. The quantity can be said to have developed significantly, but the equipment, funding, and professors are not enough to meet the needs. It is planned to stop recruiting preparatory courses this autumn, reduce the number of departments, and concentrate funding, starting with quality, so that the name can match the reality.</p>
<p>(2) Secondary Education: Secondary education in Henan includes 14 provincial junior high schools, 1 senior high school, 5 male normal schools, 2 female normal schools, 1 female middle school, and 4 vocational schools. There are about 40 other county-level junior high schools. Due to repeated changes and unrest, the content is not substantial. It is planned to spend three years reorganizing the interior of the middle school, increasing funding, adding school buildings, books, instruments, and other equipment, and improving teachers' treatment, concentrating teacher talents. After the reorganization plan is completed, it will be expanded.</p>
<p>(3) Primary Education: For primary education in Henan, reorganization and expansion should be carried out simultaneously. In other words, reorganize county and municipal primary schools on the one hand, and train teachers and increase funds on the other, and gradually expand after one year, with the goal of completing universal education.</p>
<p>(4) Adult Remedial Education: For adult illiterate people, it was originally planned to have them receive education in remedial schools within six years. Therefore, the province has established a mass normal school and a mass experimental school to train teachers. All agencies and schools have attached mass schools and vocational training classes as a preliminary plan. In the rural areas, there are mass remedial classes in the classrooms of primary schools every night, and mass schools are set up in public places in each village as a second step plan. Investigate the number of illiterate adults in various places, conduct detailed statistics, and provide remedial education in stages. If there are still people in the locality who have not received remedial education within six years, the person in charge and the person who has not received education will be subject to appropriate penalties. After six years, the people will be able to exercise their powers, so as to facilitate all the work during the period of political tutelage as a final plan.</p>
<p>(5) Social Education: The Education Department has set up a Social Education Promotion Department to manage social education in the province. Each county has established a Social Education Lecture Office to manage social education in the county. The province has established a mass museum, an art college, a sports field, a library, a circulating library, adult mass and agricultural, industrial, and commercial remedial schools, etc. Each county has also been established in order. After the locality is settled, it will be expanded. It is also planned to set up a social education agency in each county to study and implement good methods and train practical talents, so as to complete the mission of social education.</p>
<p>The above are all briefly stated. After the detailed plan is printed, it will be distributed separately. (April 15, 1930, in the capital)</p>

<h3 id="e112">Discussion on the Four-Three System for Secondary Schools Wang Maozu <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<h3 id="e113">▲Reasons <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>1.  The German middle school lasts for nine years, and the students graduate at the age of eighteen. The French middle school has a preliminary stage of four years and a later stage of three years, and the graduation age is also seventeen or eighteen. The American middle school implements a three-three system, and the graduation age is eighteen. The Japanese middle school used to be a five-year system. Due to teaching improvement and increased level, it has been changed to four years, plus three years of higher school, for a total of seven years. The graduation age is around twenty. Under the German and French middle schools, there are preparatory classes with a study period of three years and four years respectively. The United States and Japan are promoted from the primary school ladder. Primary schools are mostly six years. Our country imitates the six-three-three system, and the total number of years for primary and secondary schools is twelve, and the graduation age is also eighteen years, which is similar to the schools of various countries and shorter than the school age of Japan. Considering the middle school curriculum of our country, the local language, party doctrine, local history and geography, general social knowledge, and general knowledge of Chinese culture are more burdensome in terms of the relationship on the national culture than the curricula of other countries. It is even more necessary to study foreign languages, general world knowledge, various general sciences, and vocational skills. The difficulty of allocation and the fatigue of students can be imagined. However, if we want to match the study years of European and American middle schools, we will inevitably be blindly imitating. If the level of middle schools cannot be improved, then university education cannot be progressed. In addition to finding ways to improve teaching, it is necessary to extend it by one year because the curriculum is burdensome and must be studied.</p>
<p>2.  Curriculum allocation is most difficult in the junior high school stage. Since the promulgation of the new school system in the eleventh year, the debate between the three-three system and the four-two system has not ceased. Even the middle school regulations promulgated by the former University Council also listed the three-three system and the four-two system in parallel. Currently, the junior high school curriculum standards set by the Ministry of Education have a total of 180 credits, with an average of more than 30 credits per semester. I am afraid that it is not suitable for children's ability to understand and digest, and only 12 credits are given to history and geography, and 15 credits are given to natural sciences, including geology, minerals, meteorology, etc. I am afraid that there will be many obstacles in actual teaching. If junior high school is only prepared for entering higher education, a six-year consistent system can be established from high school. However, if junior high school becomes a separate stage, then the elements of modern world culture and general science teaching materials must also form a circle, but the content of this circle is very thin, which in turn reduces the level of senior high school. This is one of the problems. Moreover, in theory, it is stipulated that one hour of class and one hour of self-study is one credit. In practice, students often spend two or three hours preparing for the basic subjects, and they inevitably neglect the other subjects. This is the second problem. Primary schools use pure Mandarin, while junior high schools must understand classical Chinese and be able to write classical Chinese. In the future, entering higher education and application cannot completely abolish classical Chinese. Therefore, a gap has already occurred between primary school and junior high school, and junior high school Chinese language teaching is more difficult than before. Considering that the school age of middle schools in Germany and France is advanced, it is mainly because the basic teaching subjects, language training, are different from ordinary primary schools. This is a dual-track school system, which is contrary to the trend of modern popularization. It would be very good if junior high schools in our country can train students who are preparing to enter higher education and those who are preparing for vocational careers separately. However, according to the curriculum standards set by the Ministry of Education, vocational courses only have 5 to 15 credits. It is difficult to achieve the effect of practical application. This is the third problem. According to the various difficulties mentioned above, it is especially necessary to increase the time limit.</p>
<p>3.  Since the promulgation of the new school system in the eleventh year, the middle schools with four-year system in various places have been eager to run high schools as if the higher vocational schools have been enthusiastically changed to universities, regardless of the economic situation, equipment, and teacher qualifications. The content of the school is empty and the teaching level has not been improved. It is better to run a four-year middle school diligently and realistically. However, after implementing the three-three system, if we want to shorten it by one year and change it to run a junior high school, then we will be depressed. Local people also take pride in changing to a high school and promote it together, regardless of how many students can enter the high school. Therefore, more high schools are set up, and the efficiency of education is diluted due to division. This is also a problem with extremely valuable research value. If the four-three system is adopted, the Ministry of Education should send personnel to cooperate with the Education Department to investigate the educational conditions of the areas where middle schools in each province are located, the school performance, the number of students, the school building equipment, the teacher's academic qualifications, experience, writings, etc., and set a standard for each. Each province divides the senior high school areas, merges those that should be merged, and adds those that should be added. If training is concentrated in this way, it is not difficult to increase the efficiency of education.</p>
<p>4.  Junior high schools should be universal, and senior high schools should be selected. Some people think that after extending the time limit by one year, they are afraid that the economic power of education cannot bear it. This can be solved by scholarships. If it is like today's system, junior high schools already have the sigh of the palace wall, let alone senior high schools. The establishment of junior high schools has theoretical aspects that belong to psychology, and social aspects, which are very long. It is also important to explore personality and implement vocational training. If one year is added, then vocational training will not be worried about being young, and more opportunities can be given to practice it. When they come out and apply it, their skills will be improved, and their sense of responsibility will be more abundant. Moreover, at the beginning of the implementation of compulsory education, Jiangsu Province alone lacks about 14,000 teachers in the first year. If the third-year students of junior high school volunteer to be teachers, they can choose to study education courses, and in the second semester of the fourth year, they can be assigned to practice, which can supplement the lack of teachers. Since the previous junior high school graduates, in addition to entering higher education, mostly stay at home idly, and are at a loss, which is a major concern in education and society. (It is easier to find ways for senior high school graduates who do not enter higher education)</p>
<p>5.  According to the experience of various middle schools in Jiangsu Province, about 80% of junior high school graduates enter higher education, and many drop out within one year after entering senior high school. Then, adding one year to junior high school to enrich general subjects and add vocational training is also to meet the needs of society. The underdeveloped provinces in senior high school also have four-year junior high schools, which can also improve the level of education. According to the above, after the middle school is changed to the four-three system, there are about several benefits: (1) The curriculum is easier to allocate; (2) Vocational training is easier to implement; (3) Senior high schools can be managed in a concentrated manner, increasing efficiency; (4) The level of university is improved accordingly. Is it appropriate? I would like to discuss it with educators.</p>

<h3 id="e114">A Little Hope for the Second National Education Conference Ma He-tian <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Second National Education Conference has opened. The special features of this time are,</p>
<p>as Minister Jiang said at the opening ceremony, (1) that the entire systematic plan for improving national education was formulated in advance by experts, planning for twenty years, so as to avoid piecemeal and chaotic proposals based on subjective views, regardless of urgency, and (2) that the members are required to have education administrators from each county and city, one from each province, who know the actual situation of each place. This is really the advantage of this conference over the first one.</p>
<p>But I still have a little doubt. (1) China has too large an area, and the cultural level, economic situation, and various special circumstances of each place are too different. I don't know if a unified and consistent plan can be suitable. (2) The plan must be based on facts, that is, based on the investigation and statistics of each place. The situation in various parts of our country is too complicated. There are many places where all investigation and statistical materials are absolutely absent. Some have a part, but they are not accurate. Is it appropriate to base an inaccurate or unfounded plan on the actual situation and can it be implemented? Moreover, in the current situation, there are drastic and irregular changes in various places almost every year. Is there a risk that the twenty-year plan will be wrong in one place and wrong in the whole plan? (3) What percentage of the education administrators of each county and city actually attended this time? What percentage of those who really seek from the people? Moreover, the circumstances vary greatly from place to place. Can one person represent them? Is the result still separated from the real situation in each place? Therefore, I hope that this conference will consider the special circumstances of each place in various plans and measures, so as to have a retractable flexibility, and leave room for active and flexible changes in the whole, so that the personnel who are actually responsible for the education administration of each place can implement it according to the environment, so that the plan does not deviate from the facts, and does not "put it on the shelf" as a result of the first conference.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Reflections on Improving Preliminary Education Plans in the Education Program - Dongqing <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Primary education is mostly run by local municipalities and counties. The social conditions of each municipality and county are naturally vastly different, each with its own characteristics and difficulties. In running elementary school education, one must pay attention to the individuality of children on the one hand, and adapt to the local social conditions on the other. This is something everyone knows and acknowledges. Therefore, some may think it impossible to stipulate an improvement plan in the education program that can suit the actual conditions of all municipalities and counties across the country.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is impossible to set a method that is completely suitable for all municipalities and counties across the country. Not only is it theoretically impossible to imagine, but it has also been definitively proven to be impossible in practice. Since the Qing Dynasty's reform and establishment of schools, the government has revised [educational regulations] several times. The previous government also formulated and promulgated many regulations and bylaws for administering elementary schools in municipalities and counties across the country. But, I ask, what effect have these past rules and regulations had on the teachers who actually run elementary schools in municipalities and counties?</p>
<p>In good organizations or elementary schools, rules and regulations are always felt to be obstacles to progress, shackles that bind experimentation and research. In bad organizations or elementary schools, they are merely followed as routine, or even outwardly obeyed but inwardly violated, only put on a show when inspectors arrive. When formulating methods, people often only consider how to prevent malfeasance and how to crack down, focusing mostly on the negative aspects. As a result, the negative measures fail to make the greedy, lazy, and corrupt know how to improve, but instead severely restrict those who are able to progress automatically and have a spirit of experimentation. This not only proves that it is impossible but can also be summed up simply and directly in one sentence: "It's unnecessary!"</p>
<p>If it's impossible and unnecessary, why waste sixteen and a half pages of paper to occupy a chapter in the national education program?</p>
<p>Originally, things in the world change; they are not fixed. Statistics tell us that it is impossible to find absolutely identical and equal things, whether in material or human affairs. How can we manage ever-changing things with a rigid and uniform method? However, we humans have a special ability to find the unchanging amidst the changing. The objects and facts obtained from statistics are all changing. However, the principles found in statistics can summarize many changing phenomena into several unchanging formulas. The method of running elementary schools should vary according to the social conditions of each municipality and county. How to deal with this change, how to cope with this change, can be based on facts and refer to the successes and failures of others. [Photo of Guanghua, member of the Secondary Education Review Committee, inserted here.] Find some formulas or things like formula principles. Therefore, I say that the primary education part of the education program should focus on this point.</p>
<p>The education program can also be said to be a more detailed design in administration. Educational administration should be carried out using educational methods. This is also a recent trend. This is not empty theory; others have already tried it and achieved considerable success. Educational methods are not rigid, nor are they uniform, but neither are they unsystematic and random. We all know that teachers need to have lesson plans with outlines when teaching, and schools need to have predetermined plans when handling affairs. Handling educational administration is also like a kind of educational function, so naturally, there can also be a predetermined plan for proceeding, and this plan should not be imposed but guided. Therefore, the plan regarding the primary education part of the education program should also focus on this point.</p>
<p>If these two points can be found, the primary education part of the program may have some practical results in the future. This is my personal hope.</p>

<p>He Yingqin, Commander of the Boy Scouts of China</p>
<p>▲ Temporary First Aid Matters</p>
<p>During the scout inspection, temporary first aid matters are originally stipulated to be the responsibility of the Health Section of the local area. Due to the large number of personnel participating in the inspection, the office has informed the Central Model Hospital regarding temporary emergency matters. The Health Section of this office will provide treatment, and those who are more seriously ill and need to be hospitalized will be sent directly to the hospital. At the same time, two doctors will be hired by the office to be responsible for temporary first aid work, and a large number of medicines will be prepared for use.</p>
<p>▲ Grand Camp Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Grand Camp of the All-Scout General Inspection was delayed due to continuous rain for several days. The sky cleared on the 16th. On the morning of the 17th, after Dai strongly advocated for it, it was decided that the Grand Camp would still be held at Xiaoying from that day. Starting at 2:00 PM, they departed from the officer research class, and the management section distributed campsites. Instantly, hundreds of tents were set up. Looking at the grand scene of the field camp from a high place, one couldn't help but feel refreshed. In the evening, the camp lights were lit, and the candlelight shone brightly. After dinner, each group either gathered for a high-spirited conversation, visited each other, played harmonicas and sang songs, or performed and showed off their skills. All the scouts were also full of vigor. It was a grand spectacle unprecedented in the history of the Boy Scouts of China, a lively scene of nature.</p>
<p>▲ General Inspection Ceremony</p>
<p>The General Inspection Ceremony of All Scouts has been revised as follows due to He Yingqin's departure to the front and the inability to hold a supplementary oath: (1) Music; (2) All stand at attention; (3) Sing the Party Song; (4) Raise the flag; (5) Music; (6) Bow three times to the Party, National Flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (7) The Chairman respectfully reads Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; (8) Three minutes of silence; (9) Hold the General Inspection, music; (A) Parade: 1. Report the number of people, 2. Inspection, 3. Basic Exercises; (B) Marching: 1. Command to start, 2. The whole group circles the field once, 3. Speech, 4. Cheers, 5. Music, 6. Return to camp.</p>
<p>Zou Fan, a member of the Central Committee, was additionally appointed as a judge for the All-Scout General Inspection.</p>
<p>The Central Training Department has prepared various prizes to be awarded to the scouts participating in the inspection to encourage them. The prizes include 19 satin flags, 8 silver shields, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy. It is planned to issue one copy to each group as a souvenir. In addition, each group will be presented with a photo of He Yingqin.</p>
<p>▲ Notify All Sectors to Visit</p>
<p>The Beijing City Party Department Civil Training Committee notified all schools and mass organizations in Beijing to visit. In addition, all students of the Central Political School will also arrive at that time.</p>
<p>▲ Jimei and Other Schools Rush to Make Clothing</p>
<p>The Boy Scout Headquarters stipulated that all scout uniforms that are self-made will not be allowed to enter the field. It is now heard that the scout leaders of Jimei, Guangzhao, Jinan, Jiangnvzhuan, and other schools are most heartbroken by the inability to participate in the general inspection. On the one hand, they are urging workers to rush to make them, and on the other hand, they are borrowing clothes everywhere. They may not be disappointed at the time.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Rehearsal Inspection</p>
<p>In order to achieve a neat form for the inspection on the 18th, the office held a rehearsal at the inspection site at 2:00 PM yesterday. At that time, the management section sent scouts to ask the public to leave the field so that the performance could be carried out. Most of the audience was reluctant to leave. After the scouts persuaded them in many ways, they slowly dispersed. Outside the field, the scouts were able to begin preparations. The office convened the group leaders for a discussion, and then convened the deputy commanders and division commanders to explain the key points of the rehearsal. After the explanation, each group gathered around the group station. The office convened the group leaders for a second discussion. After the discussion, the office director Shi Weihuan, deputy director Zhang Zhongren, and member of the Central Committee Zhang Daofan inspected the field in a car. The military appearance was quite orderly. After the inspection, the drill of the march-past and basic movements began. The maneuvers were very beautiful. After the march-past, the marching drill was immediately followed. The entire scout group marched around the field for several weeks. The neat steps and graceful posture won a lot of praise from the audience, and the applause was like thunder. However, because of the continuous rain in the previous days, although it cleared on the 16th, there was still standing water in the field. The scouts felt great difficulty when passing through the area. The office decided to fill the field with great difficulty that night to facilitate the inspection on the 18th. After the marching drill, they lined up in front of the inspection platform to listen to the speech, but due to time constraints, the speech was omitted. Then, the whole group shouted the slogans "Long live the Boy Scouts of China," "Long live the Chinese Kuomintang," and "Long live the Chinese Republic." Each dispersed and returned to the camp area. It was already 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Important Announcements from the Office <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Brief History of the Boy Scouts</p>
<p>▲ The Significance of Holding the General Inspection</p>
<p>The office issued a brief history of the Boy Scouts and the significance of holding the National Boy Scout General Inspection. (1) The Establishment of the World Boy Scouts: Boy Scout training began at the end of the 19th century. The first World Boy Scout group was established in the summer of 1907. The founder was Mr. Baden-Powell of England. His intention was to cultivate hardworking and self-reliant young children to correct the bad habits and abuses of laziness and reliance, and to instill an inner mission, such as the British Boy Scouts' instillation of loyalty to the royal family and respect for God. (2) The Establishment of the Boy Scouts in Our Country: The Boy Scout cause in our country began in the first year of the Republic, organized by Wuchang Wenhua University. Later, various places followed suit, especially church schools. The shortcomings were: 1. The organization was uneven, with each going its own way; 2. The training only imitated the superficialities of Europe and America, without real meaning, and even became a tool for cultural aggression by imperialism. (3) The Past of the Kuomintang Boy Scouts: Our Party is deeply concerned about the youth and children of the country. Therefore, in the 15th year of the Republic, the Kuomintang Boy Scout Committee was established. Later, due to the focus on the Northern Expedition and other work, not much could be done in this regard. (4) In May of the 17th year of the Republic, the Central Training Department proposed amendments to the Party Boy Scout Regulations, etc., which were passed by the Standing Committee. Under the Central Training Department, the Party Boy Scout Headquarters was established to handle organization, training, compilation, review, and assessment. For more than a year, the results have been quite remarkable. (5) The Renaming and Reorganization of the Boy Scouts of China: After the Third Plenary Session, the Central Government planned to further reorganize the Boy Scout cause, renamed it the Boy Scouts of China, and established the Boy Scout Headquarters of China, directly under the Central Executive Committee, and established the Boy Scout Education Section under the Training Department. (6) The Current Situation of the Boy Scouts of China: Since the establishment of the Party Boy Scout Headquarters until now, the Boy Scouts in various places have developed rapidly under the leadership of our Party. The total number of Boy Scouts who have been registered is about 200 groups, with more than 13,300 people. There are more than 1,100 service members. More than a dozen Boy Scout social organizations have applied for registration. This is a very good phenomenon. (7) The Postponement of the General Inspection: This National General Inspection and Grand Camp is an unprecedented initiative in our country. It was originally scheduled to be held on the Double Tenth Festival last year. Later, due to the short time frame, it was feared that the distant regions would not be able to participate, so it was changed to be held today. The Boy Scouts and service members who attended are not afraid of hardship and have come from afar, which is deeply gratifying. (8) The Significance of the General Inspection: The significance of the General Inspection is: 1. To understand the achievements of past management; 2. To serve as a reference for future progress; 3. To make the Boy Scout situation known to the whole society and receive assistance; 4. To allow the Boy Scouts and service members from various places to connect with each other, foster friendship, and enhance academics; 5. To commemorate the anniversary of our Party establishing its capital in Nanjing, holding the General Inspection in the capital, the Boy Scouts from various places should be more aware of the importance of their mission and resolutely take on the responsibility and actively do it. (9) The Meaning of Re-Inspection: Especially in the daily efforts of the Boy Scouts after the event. It is hoped that the Boy Scouts and service members in various places will understand this and strive forward every day.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Shanghai Student Federation Opposes the Screening of Humiliating Films by Ginling College <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Student Federation sent a telegram to the nation yesterday, opposing the screening of films insulting to the Chinese people at the Christian Education Annual Meeting of Ginling College. The telegram stated (excerpt): It is observed that imperialists use Christianity as a tool for cultural aggression, using every means to numb the youth of our country. Recently, they have intensified their efforts unscrupulously. The Christian Youth Association of Ginling College even screened films made by Professor Hsu Fu-erh himself at the entertainment gathering, depicting the slums of our country, snotty-nosed children, (women with bound feet, monks conducting funerals, beggars picking lice, and various other ugly scenes). Such open screenings are intentionally insulting. If we do not strongly oppose this and instead passively accept it, we, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, would truly be ignorant of human shame. Our Federation has long been deeply concerned about the cultural aggression of Christianity and the numbing of youth by youth associations in various regions. We are even more indignant about the screening of films insulting to the Chinese people by the Ginling College Youth Association. We earnestly hope that compatriots across the country will unite in opposition, further prevent cultural aggression, and diligently recover educational rights. This would be a great blessing for the future of the nation. We respectfully submit this telegram for your wise consideration.

<h3 id="e132">Stalemate on the Issue of Chinese Directors at the Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Ratepayers' Association Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Residents' Representatives Express Sympathy for Our Chinese People</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Municipal Council to Convene a Special Meeting of Westerners</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement convened a temporary emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at the Chamber of Commerce to discuss the issue of Chinese directors at the Shanghai Municipal Council. After two hours of discussion, it was resolved that the resolution of the Western ratepayers' annual meeting regarding Chinese directors was invalid. At the same time, three representatives were publicly elected to go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest. The newly elected five Chinese directors insisted on attending the meetings of the Municipal Council. If the Municipal Council only allows three Chinese directors to attend, then other countermeasures will be decided upon. On the Municipal Council's side, it must abide by the resolutions of the Western ratepayers' annual meeting, making its situation very difficult. Therefore, the issue has largely reached a stalemate. The details of what was heard yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Results of the Emergency Meeting: General Assembly of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the General Assembly of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association held a temporary emergency meeting at the standing committee room of the Chamber of Commerce. Over fifty people attended, chaired by Wang Xiaolai, who reported on the purpose of the meeting. Yu Qiaqing reported on the history of struggles to increase the number of Chinese directors and the methods of not recognizing the Western ratepayers' decision on the rights of Chinese ratepayers were discussed. The following resolutions were unanimously passed: (1) Publish a declaration in the newspaper stating that the Western Ratepayers' Association has no right to decide on the issue of Chinese directors of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. (2) Refute the arguments of the British lawyer Macdonell, to be drafted by the secretary of the General Assembly, and revised and published by the chairman of the General Assembly in conjunction with the Chinese directors committee. (3) Telegraph to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting serious negotiations, and appoint Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, and Hu Mengjia to petition the Ministry.</p>
<p>▲ Declaration of the Ratepayers' Association: The Shanghai International Settlement Chinese Ratepayers'</p>
<p>Association declares: This Association affirms that the Shanghai International Settlement Western Ratepayers' Association has no right to discuss the civic rights that the Chinese ratepayers of the Shanghai International Settlement should have. Based on this principle, the rejection of the motion to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Shanghai Municipal Council by two at the Western Ratepayers' meeting on April 16th of this year is naturally invalid. This is solemnly declared.</p>
<p>▲ Letter from the Municipal Council: After the Association held its General Assembly the day before yesterday and elected the Chinese directors committee and the executive committee, in addition to sending letters to the elected candidates to notify the various groups and organizations, it also formally notified the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The original letter stated: To Mr. Macnaghten, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council: Regarding the directors representing the Chinese ratepayers within the Settlement to attend your council's executive affairs from 1920 to the end of 1931, we have followed the instructions of the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our national government, and have received a note from the Spanish Minister to China, approving the increase from three seats to five seats. On April 16th, the General Assembly of this Association elected Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Xu Xinliu, Mr. Bei Songsun, and Mr. Liu Hongsheng to serve as directors. The six committee members elected were Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Tai Runqing, Mr. Chen Tingrui, Mr. Li Fuxun, Mr. Qian Longzhang, and Mr. Wu Yunzhai. We are enclosing the resumes of the directors and committee members for your reference. Sincerely, Chairman Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilong, April 17, 1930, Republic of China. Attached: one copy of the resumes of the directors and committee members.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Directors Assumed Office Yesterday: The nine foreign directors of the Municipal Council, six British, two Japanese, and one American, all assumed office yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Council. However, the Chinese directors did not go because they had not received notification from the Municipal Council's office. The nine foreign directors, as in past years, elected the chairman and vice-chairman, unanimously electing Macnaghten as chairman and Hebar as vice-chairman. Regarding the process of rejecting the increase of two Chinese director seats, there is a fact that is quite interesting, and it is specially noted here. Only 252 people attended the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting the day before yesterday. Because the annual meeting has no quorum requirement, it can still be held as usual even if only one or two people attend. Macdonell, the mover of the motion against increasing the number of Chinese directors, is a lawyer who was originally recuperating at the Hong En Hospital. Unexpectedly, he suddenly attended and gave a speech, causing a great uproar, from which the matter arose. Many of the Westerners who raised their hands to reject the motion regretted it afterward.</p>
<p>▲ Attitude of the Municipal Council: Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Edward, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, to inquire about the Municipal Council's position and its solutions to the issue. Mr. Edward replied that all the foreign directors of the Municipal Council, as well as the Director-General Fessenden and he, were genuinely sincere in proposing the increase of Chinese directors from three to five seats in order to achieve Chinese-foreign cooperation. The Municipal Council was confident that the proposal would be passed smoothly at the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, but the result was unexpectedly rejected. The Municipal Council is very sorry that things did not go as planned. Furthermore, because the Western Ratepayers' Association is the master of the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council has no choice but to comply with the resolutions of the Association. Therefore, the twists and turns of this issue are not the fault of the Municipal Council, and it hopes that the Chinese side will forgive it and not punish the Municipal Council for this. At the meeting this afternoon, all the directors unanimously expressed regret over this unfortunate event. As a temporary compromise, they only hope that the three Chinese directors who received the most votes among the newly elected five Chinese directors will attend the Municipal Council as usual. The three gentlemen are the original directors, and have a good relationship with the Municipal Council through years of cooperation. The Municipal Council very much welcomes their attendance. If, as reported, the five Chinese directors insist on attending at the same time, or else all of them will be absent, then the Municipal Council will have no Chinese directors this year, and Chinese-foreign cooperation will return to the situation of five years ago. Another report states that foreign residents in Shanghai are very dissatisfied that one person spoke out against the proposal at that time, and the voters did not review it carefully, and hastily rejected it. In order to comply with public opinion, the Municipal Council plans to convene a special meeting of Western ratepayers within days to reconsider the case, so that a thorough discussion can be made, and the original purpose can be achieved.</p>
<p>▲ Special Meeting of Westerners: Subsequently, the reporter visited Deputy Director-General Jones and asked about the temporary convening of a special meeting of Western ratepayers to re-vote on the case. Jones replied that this matter was originally the only remedy at present. However, based on his past experience, he felt that it was quite difficult to convene. Because the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting has no quorum requirement, it is only necessary for twenty-five people to propose convening a special meeting, which can be done. However, there is still a quorum requirement, that is, more than one-third of the foreign ratepayers must attend to hold the meeting. There are about three thousand foreign taxpayers in the city. If one-third is used as a quorum, then more than one thousand people must attend. In 1925, the Municipal Council wanted to convene a special meeting to deal with the issue of child labor, but it failed. Since then, the Municipal Council has repeatedly wanted to amend the regulations, but has repeatedly failed to do so. Therefore, it is still uncertain whether it can be held this time.</p>
<p>▲ Speech by Mr. Shigemitsu: The Japanese Deputy Minister Shigemitsu, the Japanese directors of the Municipal Council Fukushima and Saito, and representatives of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, etc., also discussed the issue for several hours at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday, and have discussed concrete solutions. In general, they sympathize with our side, and will express their assistance within days. Mr. Shigemitsu also made a speech for this yesterday, saying, "The proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council from three to five has long been approved by the entire City Council. I believe that this move is appropriate and the most just measure, and I express my extreme approval. I also know that the Japanese residents of Shanghai also agree with this move. Because I have received reports that the Japanese who attended the Western Ratepayers' Meeting yesterday all supported the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors. The result of the Western Ratepayers' Meeting yesterday was such that I think that a motion opposing the original proposal was suddenly put forward, resulting in a lack of thorough deliberation. I think that for this kind of proposal that is a major issue in the administration of the entire Shanghai, it should be decided after a full debate between the pros and cons. As the acting minister and consul general, I will carefully consider it and strive to seek appropriate measures. I very much hope that the final outcome can realize the most just decision of the City Council. This is not only my personal opinion, but also the representative opinion of the Japanese residents."</p>
<p>▲ Statement by the Japanese Directors: The Japanese directors of the Municipal Council, Fukushima and Saito, came to this newspaper yesterday and stated on behalf of all the Japanese taxpayers that the Japanese have always strongly supported the proposal to increase the number of Chinese director seats, but because there are quite a few people who are not familiar with English, not many attended the ratepayers' annual meeting the day before yesterday, resulting in the sudden rejection of the proposal to increase the number of Chinese director seats. They all expressed regret. As for this newspaper's report yesterday that the rejection of the proposal was due to the manipulation of the Japanese, it was actually a rumor.</p>
<p>▲ Declarations by Various Party Branches: The third and sixth district party branches of this city also issued declarations yesterday. The original text is recorded as follows: (1) Declaration of the Third District Party Branch: It is a common demand of citizens in European and American countries that there should be no representation without taxation, and it is also based on the principle of equality of rights and obligations. More than 80% of our Chinese citizens reside in the Shanghai International Settlement, and the taxes paid account for 60% of the total amount, but the number of Chinese director seats is less than one-fourth. According to the principle of equality of taxation, it is greatly disproportionate. This year, based on the verbal agreement to increase the extra surtax by two, and through repeated negotiations by the diplomatic authorities and the Chinese directors, there was a result of increasing the number of Chinese director seats by two, which is not enough to satisfy our wishes, nor can it achieve the goal of fairness. However, the Western Ratepayers' Meeting yesterday actually rejected it, and lawyer Macdonell even made insulting remarks to our Chinese people. This not only abandoned its credibility, but also showed contempt for our compatriots. Moreover, it is extremely absurd that the number of Chinese director seats for citizens who pay the same taxes should be decided by the Western Ratepayers' Meeting. This district party branch vows to oppose it to the death, and hopes that all compatriots will uphold the spirit of perseverance and work together for the movement to recover the concessions, in order to seek a permanent solution. This is hereby declared. (2) Declaration of the Sixth District Party Branch: (The title is omitted) The proposal to increase the number of Chinese director seats was actually rejected by the Western Ratepayers' Meeting. This is a natural result of seeking cooperation with a tiger, and it is not surprising. However, the concessions are our country's territory. Before the color is changed, the ultimate sovereignty can only belong to the Chinese and not to the Westerners. Since it does not belong to the Westerners, then according to the fair principle of taxation, we should increase the number of Chinese directors to more than twelve in order to conform to the principle of equality of rights and obligations. Now that they have violated the purpose of municipal administration, and they are not willing to accept even the trivial two powerless Chinese director seats, this is not only a contempt for our national sovereignty, but also a trampling on the face of our Chinese nation, and giving us a major embarrassment. Therefore, we dare to demand, under serious protest, that a group of Chinese directors refuse to cooperate with the Westerners, and that the citizens of the entire city declare a rent strike, in order to accommodate our minimum conditions. At the same time, we also hope that the diplomatic authorities will immediately propose negotiations to recover the concessions, so that the area where sovereignty has been lost may have a day of recovery. The members of this association only know how to complete revolutionary diplomacy, abolish unequal treaties, in order to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. If anyone dares to obstruct our plan, or invade our land and become long-term occupants, we vow to bomb it with ten thousand dan of neck blood. This is hereby declared. We look forward to a response. (The rest is omitted)</p>
<p>▲ Report in a Western Newspaper: The Da Wan Bao said, "The speech made by a certain gentleman at the City Hall yesterday (16th) against increasing the number of Chinese directors in the Municipal Council, which led to the rejection of the proposal, any reader who reads it will come to a conclusion from their heart, saying, 'It directly regards the Chinese as outsiders, and regards foreigners, i.e., British, American, Japanese, etc. residents, as natives.' Those who regard themselves as natives will naturally regard themselves as heirs to the British Empire's legacy created by Wellington and Mac荣." This kind of reasoning is obviously flawed and dangerous to non-British people. Today's critics of the authorities believe that foreign residents in Shanghai know more about the methods of governing this complex city, and those who are in charge of governing the country should follow the will of the local residents without interference. This policy is harmful and useless. The biggest problem in Shanghai today is that it often has such remarks and tries to implement them. Shanghai's municipal administration should be handled by suitable talents, and should not fall into the hands of those who reside in Shanghai solely for their own personal interests. Those who are far away are clear, and those who are near are obscured. For conflicting foreign interests, the further away those who handle them are, the more fair the judgment and the more clear the views. Last year, there were many achievements in the concessions due to the friendship between China and foreign countries, and there are many future achievements as well. However, a speech at the City Hall and the results it caused have overthrown everything in one night, and even jeopardized the basis of cooperation that has been sought for many years. Increasing two Chinese directors in the Board of Directors has gains and no losses. The gains can not only generate a more friendly and cooperative relationship among these complex ethnic groups, but also open a way to finally resolve the concession issue. Today, the final solution depends entirely on increasing the administrative talent of the Chinese. No one can deny this. It is fundamentally bad that 242 taxpayers who attend the meeting cast 414 votes. No matter how good the administrative of the municipal administration it creates, it cannot hide the flaws in the concession's administrative system, which has long been unable to represent its residents and has lost its fairness. Fortunately, experts are in Shanghai carefully investigating and suggesting remedies, but if there had not been a setback at yesterday's City Hall meeting, the results of the expert investigation would have been easier to accept. In short, foreign residents in Shanghai are ultimately from other countries. If you want to strongly refer to the Chinese people living in the local area as foreigners, and recognize the foreigners who gather at the City Hall as natives, then the fundamental is already wrong.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram of Congratulations from Foreign Minister Wang: Foreign Minister Wang sent a telegram to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, saying, "Chairman Wang of the General Assembly of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in Shanghai, and also forwarded to directors Yuan (Ludeng), Yu (Qiaqing), Xu (Xinliu), Bei (Songsun), Liu (Hongsheng), and committee members Lin (Kanghou), Li (Fuxun), Qian (Longzhang), Wu (Yunzhai), all respected: I have read your telegram and learned that you have been elected. I am looking forward to your new plans. In addition to preparing the case, I am sending this telegram to congratulate you. Wang Zhengting, Minister of Foreign Affairs, kowtows."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Central Mint Hosted a Tour for the Press Yesterday <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>▲ Can Mint 400,000 Silver Dollars in Ten Hours</p>
<p>▲ Will Officially Start Minting Upon Receipt of Instructions from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Central Mint hosted reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers at its factory site on Xiaoshadu Road at 2:30 PM yesterday. The reporters were led on a tour of various locations by Factory Director Guo Biao, Deputy Factory Director Wei Xianzhang, technicians Tang Xuping, Wen Zongyu, Guo Huide, and American technician H.W. Heard. They bid farewell around 4:00 PM. According to Deputy Factory Director Wei's statement to this newspaper's reporter, all of the factory's machinery is the latest model, and it can mint more than 400,000 silver dollars and more than 200,000 subsidiary coins in ten hours. The model is planned to be adopted from Italy, but it has not been fully determined yet. The fineness of the silver dollar may need to be slightly changed due to the change to the gold standard. At present, all the machinery has been installed, and the workers have also been trained. Minting will begin upon receipt of instructions from the Ministry of Finance. There are currently dozens of workers, and this will be increased to more than 300 after minting officially begins. The National Government has decided to implement the abolition of taels for dollars in July, so it is necessary to mint a sufficient quantity of silver dollars before then. It is expected that the date of commencement of minting is not far away.</p>
<p>▲ History of the Factory: The Central Mint was originally named the Shanghai Mint. When Zhou Ziqi was Minister of Finance in the ninth year of the Republic of China, he commissioned Zhong Wenyao to borrow a large sum from the Shanghai Chinese Banking Group to plan and proceed. After Zhong resigned, the Ministry of Finance commissioned Sa Tongsun to take over and continue the work. At that time, Sa had already purchased and built the address and factory buildings, and various machines had also been ordered from the United States. By the eleventh year, the machines that had been ordered had arrived in Shanghai one after another. The Ministry of Finance did not extract them because the price had not been paid, and the factory was thus stalled. In the twelfth year, the Ministry of Finance commissioned Zhu Youji to take over again, but Zhu resigned not long after. After Zhu left, the Chinese Banking Group took over for safekeeping. In the fourteenth year, Sun Chuanfang arrived in Ning and commissioned Fu Zongyao as the factory director, but he did not take office. In the sixteenth year, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government commissioned Wang Chengzulai to head this factory. After Wang resigned, in the seventeenth year, Tang Shoumin was commissioned to take over again. Not long after, Tang resigned due to the inability to attend to many affairs. In November of the same year, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance commissioned Guo Biao to take over. In July of the following year, Wei Xianzhang was appointed as deputy factory director to actively carry out the project. The Central Mint has a very large debt. After the two factory directors Guo and Wei took office, they successively petitioned the Ministry of Finance to pay off the debt. Now the surrounding walls, wharf, bridges, dormitory buildings have all been completed, and the coin minting, gas, and electricity machinery have also been installed. They are now being tested separately, and the results are very good.</p>
<p>▲ A Glimpse of the Interior: Yesterday afternoon, reporters from various newspapers first visited the chemical analysis room, which has a row of American-style gas silver melting furnaces, which melt raw silver and then analyze its composition in detail. Next to the chemical analysis room is the raw silver vault. The adjacent room is equipped with multiple silver bar making machines, which crush the raw silver and then make it into silver bars, which are then placed in a sulfuric acid solution and stored in the silver bar vault in the third room. The next is the flattening machine, which flattens the silver bars and then puts them into the silver cake making machine to turn them into cakes, which are then transferred to the edge engraving machine, the upper and lower flower embossing machines, and the silver dollar is roughly formed. It is then moved to the polishing machine in the next room to make it as shiny as new, and then dried with a machine. The next room is an automatic weighing machine that weighs the weight of the silver dollar, and an automatic machine that identifies the beauty of the silver dollar pattern. This is the last step of the work. At this point, the minting of the silver dollar is completed. The new silver dollars are placed in the silver dollar vault in the last room. The doors of each vault are purchased from the United States and are extremely strong. A large balance scale is placed opposite each to weigh the items at any time to avoid theft and leakage. The factory has 350 horsepower and 50 horsepower electric generators, and the equipment is extremely perfect. During the tour yesterday, the chief engineer, the American Heard, personally tested the purple copper bars, and the results were good.</p>

<p>▲ Telegraphs Commander Xiong</p>
<p>Hu Zuyu, the commander-in-chief for the suppression of bandits in Taihu Lake, Suzhou, telegraphed Commander Xiong yesterday (the 16th): Respectfully to Commander Xiong of Shanghai, the situation of the bandits in Si'an has been telegraphed in the previous telegram, which I believe has been reviewed. Now, according to the telegram from Regiment Commander Zhong yesterday, the bandits, numbering about 800, are resisting stubbornly near Kongshan Mountain. After a fierce attack, they have fled south. The situation of the bandits there is complex. I have decided to lead Zou Battalion to the Wu-Chang area to supervise the suppression of bandits tomorrow morning. All matters of the bandit suppression headquarters will be handled by Tong Yuanliang, the chief of the staff of the division headquarters.

<p>▲ Night Navigation Returns to Normal</p>
<p>The Yangtze River waterway, due to the narrow waterway near Jiujiang during the previous low-water period, had issued an order prohibiting navigation at night. Now, due to the rising water level, this restriction has been completely lifted yesterday and the original state has been restored. Therefore, the departure times of the Yangtze River liner services have been changed again.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Business Develops Rapidly <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of this city, as a state institution, serves the society, has solid guarantees, and complete facilities. Since its opening on March 15th, its business has been developing rapidly. The Director General of the Bureau, Liu Shufan, the Associate Director Shen Shuyu, and McLaren, along with all the staff, are working diligently. They are striving to popularize the interests of depositors. All savings regulations, such as current savings, fixed-term savings, and various methods such as lump-sum deposit and installment withdrawal, which will be added successively, are extremely simple, and the procedures are quick. There are also plans for a unified savings method, which is convenient for depositing and withdrawing money. This is an innovation in Shanghai. In the past, there were 25 post offices in the Shanghai area, but only 10 of them handled savings, and they were limited to deposit and withdrawal at the original branch, which was inconvenient for depositors. Now, all post offices in the city have opened savings branches, and they will be interconnected. For example, once an account is opened and money is deposited at the Shanghai General Bureau or a branch, money can be deposited and withdrawn at any post office in the Shanghai area at any time thereafter, allowing depositors to deposit money anywhere and withdraw money anywhere, avoiding the inconvenience of distance and the risk of carrying money on the road, and providing convenient home service. These advantages are not available in other savings institutions. The staff of the bureau have a lot of experience in savings business and are courteous, so people are happy to interact with them, and the business is developing rapidly.</p>
<p>The bureau's remittance business can be used for remittance to large and small cities at home and abroad, with low fees and easy withdrawal. In addition, referring to the successful methods of various countries, it is planning to handle transfer savings, which is especially convenient for merchants to transfer funds. As for the bureau's checks, all Chinese and foreign banks can collect and exchange them, which shows the completeness of the bureau's handling and the stability of its external credit.</p>

<p>▲ Until September 18th of this year</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday approved the consultation from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that the trademark registration certificate inspection period has expired. Although many have been inspected, due to local traffic conditions, some have not been able to submit their applications within the time limit. Now, in order to take care of Chinese and foreign merchants, it is specially granted a further extension of six months, until September 18th of this year. Please check and instruct the relevant departments to comply. It is reported that the Municipal Government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau and the Organizing Committee of Shanghai Merchant Groups to be informed.</p>

<p>▲ Seven Branch Bureaus to be Established Under its Jurisdiction in Nanjing and Other Places</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that China's navigation administration lacks a specialized bureau for management. In order to develop shipping, it has established navigation bureaus in Shanghai and other important cities and appointed Yang Ying from Guizhou as the director of the Shanghai Bureau. After nearly half a year of preparation, it will be formally established after the organizational regulations are submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval. According to an official of the preparatory office yesterday, the Ministry of Communications has designated the Shanghai Bureau as the headquarters, and seven branch bureaus will be established under its jurisdiction. The branch bureaus to be established are listed below: Nanjing Navigation Branch Bureau (also in charge of Pukou), Zhenjiang Navigation Branch Bureau (also in charge of Tongyang-Zhunyun), Suzhou Navigation Branch Bureau (also in charge of Xi-Chang), Haizhou Navigation Branch Bureau, Hangzhou Navigation Branch Bureau (also in charge of Jia-Hu Zhejiang), Ningbo Navigation Branch Bureau (also in charge of Zhenhai-Zhoushan), Wenzhou Navigation Branch Bureau (also in charge of Oujiang-Taijiang).</p>
<h3 id="e145">News of Sino-American Aviation Contract Conference <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Representative Sent by the American Side is Not Qualified</p>
<p>▲ The Aviation Industry Plans to Request a Recall</p>
<p>Since the China Aviation Corporation signed a Sino-American aviation contract with the American Aviation Development Corporation in May last year, the China Aviation Association, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, and aviation personnel in various places have all believed that the contract is greatly detrimental to the Chinese side and have actively opposed it. After Sun Ke, the chairman of the board of directors of the China Aviation Corporation, resigned, the National Government appointed Wang Boqun, the Minister of Communications, concurrently. Wang valued public opinion and carefully reviewed the contract with various departments and also believed that it needed to be revised or abolished. The National Government then ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, and the China Aviation Corporation to hold a meeting with the American representative to resolve the issue. Minister Wang notified the American Flying Transport Corporation to select a representative to come to Beijing to discuss all the details. According to news from the aviation industry yesterday, the representative sent by the American side, Max Apollin, is a businessman engaged in the kerosene business. He is not familiar with the aviation business and is not suitable to be a representative. This meeting may not have good results. Therefore, the aviation industry plans to submit a request to the authorities to consult with the United States to recall Apollin and send a qualified person so that the two parties can sign a mutually beneficial treaty and promote international transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Industry and Commerce Provide Relief to 100,000 Rickshaw Pullers in Shanghai <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>▲ Chen Shiguang Visits Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>▲ Please Restore the Vehicles Recovered in 1924 Quickly</p>
<p>In 1924, the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council recovered 5,161 rickshaws with licenses. It was originally scheduled that after a five-year period, the vehicles would be returned as appropriate. Unexpectedly, after the expiration date at the end of August last year, the Municipal Council delayed the return on various pretexts, resulting in more than 100,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai. Wang Zhengting, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, attached great importance to this matter and ordered Chen Shiguang, the director of the Shanghai office, to quickly resolve the issue with the Concession authorities to provide relief to the poor and eliminate hidden dangers. At the same time, the Minister of Industry and Commerce also sent a special commissioner to Shanghai yesterday to contact all parties. The news obtained is divided as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chen Shiguang, the director of the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received instructions from the Ministry the day before yesterday, stating: According to the report from Shanghai merchants Zheng Limin and others, rickshaw workers in the Shanghai Public Concession are being forced into unemployment, which is inhumane. Following the order, I went to the Chinese and Foreign Rickshaw Merchants Association and the Rickshaw Workers' Mutual Aid Association to discuss the matter, but the two associations refused to discuss it. I have repeatedly requested the Municipal Government, but there is no relief plan. I can only submit photos of the tragic situation of fighting for rickshaws and request the British Consul to instruct the Municipal Council to issue the 5,161 rickshaw licenses recovered in 1924 to save lives. It is found that this matter was previously reported by the people, and it was instructed that the original approval of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government should be followed, and the Chinese and Foreign Rickshaw Merchants Association and the Rickshaw Workers' Mutual Aid Association should be consulted to apply for handling. If the two associations refuse to discuss, they should request the Municipal Government to review and decide on relief. Now, according to the report, it seems that the two associations may have obstructed the matter because they have separately recognized the vehicles donated to the Public Concession. Since there are more vehicles demanded than supplied, in order to provide relief to the poor and eliminate hidden dangers, a portion of the vehicle licenses recovered in 1924 should be issued immediately to resolve disputes and prevent any party from holding the licenses for a long time. Therefore, a copy of the report and six photos are issued, instructing the office to quickly negotiate with the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council to handle the matter appropriately and report back. This order.</p>
<p>▲ The Course of Events The reporter of the New Shanghai News Agency visited a certain official from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce who came to Shanghai at the inn and was informed of the course of events in great detail. It is reported that the Shanghai Public Concession rickshaw licenses totaled 15,161 due to the prosperity of the market. In 1924, the car dealers who donated the licenses manipulated and monopolized the business, fabricated reasons for traffic congestion, and requested the Municipal Council to recover 5,161 car licenses, resulting in more than 100,000 unemployed workers. However, when the Municipal Council recovered the car licenses, it stipulated a five-year period, at which time it would be restored as appropriate. Unexpectedly, after the expiration in August last year, the workers, compelled by starvation, elected representatives to request the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government to issue the recovered car licenses. At that time, the association still obstructed the matter. Although the petitioners exhausted their voices, the listeners remained deaf. The workers had no choice but to send representatives Zheng Limin and others to Beijing in January of this year to petition the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Industry and Commerce. Ministers Kong and Wang attached great importance to this matter. In recent years, dozens of counties in Jiangbei have suffered from continuous droughts, and the disaster is extremely severe, causing the people to suffer, families to be separated, and the poor to have difficulty maintaining their lives. They have had no choice but to come to Shanghai to pull rickshaws, and the number of workers has suddenly increased to more than 100,000, gathering in Shanghai, waiting expectantly for the issuance of the car licenses every day. If the car licenses are not issued for a day, they cannot live for a day. In case they are forced by starvation to take risks or incidents similar to the May 30th Massacre occur, the hidden dangers are unimaginable. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Director Chen to earnestly resolve the issue with the Concession authorities.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting Fessenden Director Chen Shiguang, after receiving the instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the day before yesterday, decided to negotiate with the Concession authorities yesterday. In the morning, a certain gentleman from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce came to Shanghai from Beijing and went to the office at Fenglin Bridge to discuss the matter with Chen for a long time. All kinds of methods were discussed in detail. Chen then visited Fessenden, the chairman of the Municipal Council, in the afternoon for an informal contact and sent letters to the General Affairs and European and American divisions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The results of the negotiations will be reported at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Zhejiang Province Immigrants Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>▲ Approximately 300 People</p>
<p>Yesterday at about 1:00 PM, about 300 immigrants from Zhejiang Province, led by Zhou Bodong, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Immigration Committee, arrived in Shanghai on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan ship. Xu Jishi, the captain of the water patrol team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Dou Menggan, upon hearing the news, immediately supervised the police and went to take care of everything. It is reported that these immigrants will transfer to a military train today and depart for the three northeastern provinces to carry out land reclamation.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Problem of the Silk and Satin Industry Organizing a Trade Association <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲ Gradually Approaching</p>
<p>The dispute between the various silk and satin guilds in this city against the consolidation and reorganization of the Trade Association by the Chamber of Commerce has been going on for a long time. The focus of the dispute is that the Chamber of Commerce, according to Article 5 of the Trade Association Law, which states that there should be only one Trade Association in a region, insists on the merger. The various guilds argue that the organizational situation of each guild is different and that they have their own historical relationship, so they advocate separate establishment. It is now reported that the Social Affairs Bureau specially convened a discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 14th of this month to collect opinions in order to resolve the issue. The representatives present on that day included Tao Baichuan from the City Party Headquarters, Lu Youshao from the Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, Jiang Linshu, Luo Qinghua, Lu Zhengbing, and more than ten others from the Silk and Satin Industry Organizing Committee. Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the meeting and explained the legal principles and facts in detail. After three hours of discussion, the opinions of all parties on the merger and reorganization have gradually become consistent. They still respect the laws and regulations and organize a unified organization. However, it is proposed to stipulate in the charter of the Trade Association that the original guilds should be divided into groups, such as the Huzhou crepe group and the Suzhou satin group, which will be responsible for studying various issues related to the group, increasing the partial interests of the group, and keeping the original property of the group. In order to avoid difficulties in implementation in terms of facts, this method can take care of both laws and facts. The representatives of the various guilds are also satisfied. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce the next day to inform them of the results of the meeting in the hope that this dispute would be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Zhabei Industry Association Still Asks to be Reorganized <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Zhabei Industry Association sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: We have received your letter No. 973, which opened on April 10th, stating: We have received a letter from the Shanghai Special City Social Affairs Bureau, which opened on April 7th (as seen in the previous report, omitted). We have found that our association prepared the procedures in accordance with the Trade Association Organization Law on May 15, 1929, and submitted them to the Shanghai Special City Social Affairs Bureau for registration. The application was approved because the members of our association included foreign merchants, and registration was not allowed. Later, on July 26 of the same year, our association reorganized and improved, and on August 7 of the same year, we prepared the procedures and sent a letter to your association requesting approval for registration. A license No. 80 was issued. We have found that the business of building and leasing operated by the members of our association is affirmed by the general manager as the most important enterprise, and the mayor’s approval No. 1196 also confirms that our industry is a kind of business. There is no doubt that our association is a legitimate commercial organization. As for saying that the interests of property owners have been legally guaranteed, the same is true for other industries. The organization of the Trade Association is for the purpose of increasing the knowledge of the industry and seeking the construction of the industry together, not for the purpose of requesting the protection of legal interests. It is even more difficult to admit that our association is a disguised form of the homeowners association and is the basis for not allowing registration. Our industry is engaged in real estate, and other merchants are engaged in the transaction of goods. The matter is the same, so our association's application for registration is completely a legitimate act of good citizens. However, we have repeatedly applied and have not been approved. We are very embarrassed. Your association leads business operations and unifies organizations, and should not allow the real estate industry to be left out. We hereby reiterate our previous request and ask you to forward a letter to the Shanghai Special City Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that our association be reorganized in accordance with the law. This is for the public good. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Special City Merchant Group Organizing Committee.</p>

<p>▲ The Outer Bund is Densely Populated</p>
<p>▲ The Anti-Smuggling Team Arranges in Advance</p>
<p>The Wusong spring fish market occupies the commercial center of the whole town. Every year after Qingming Festival, when the spring fish season is approaching, the three fish shops, Qiancui, Baofeng, and Shenthai, all go to Wusong to make arrangements, wait for the fish boats to enter the port, and then start business. Others, such as men, women, old and young from Shandong Tao and Yancheng, are familiar with the boat owners and rely on the fish rafts (commonly known as "chasing the foreign rafts") to make a living, and have been coming to Wusong one after another in recent days, either living on boats or renting houses temporarily, in order to earn a living. As a result, the Outer Bund area has become densely populated in recent days, and the market is more prosperous. There are also various agencies related to the fishing rafts, such as the water police anti-smuggling camp, who are planning various plans for protecting and arresting smuggled salt. Yesterday, the first brigade of the anti-smuggling team stationed in Wusong issued a notice, which is copied as follows: Notice from the First Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Salt Affairs of the Five Districts of Jiangsu: For the purpose of notice, it is known that the jurisdiction of this brigade is vast and adjacent to the sea. Every fishing raft is related to the smooth flow of the official sales of the five districts of Jiangsu. The fishing raft season of this year is approaching, and arrangements should be made in advance. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Songhu Garrison Command have been requested to issue announcements and regulations separately for notification. All fishers and fish merchants should be informed and complied with. Fishing boats must abide by the ban, and fish merchants must not collude. If they violate the rules, they will be punished according to the regulations. The officers and soldiers of this brigade must also be diligent and cautious in their duties and abide by the scope. Local ruffians and hooligans must not take advantage of the fishing raft season to rely on the crowd to rob salt brine and cause trouble, resulting in being caught by the law. If there are unscrupulous people who cause trouble on the pretext of the fishing rafts, they are allowed to report to the department for strict handling. The brigade commander will enforce the law strictly and will not be lenient. Each should comply strictly. This notice. Brigade Commander Wu Shuzi.</p>

<p>▲ Xu Zhizhi, Tang Zhenchao, Confer with Japanese Residents' Representatives</p>
<p>Xu Zhizhi, also known as Jinshang, the director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau's North City Tax Collection Office, hails from Dongshan, Dongting Lake, and has resided in the North City for a long time. He is well-versed in local conditions. Since last year, he was appointed by Director Xu upon a request to Mayor Zhang to handle tax collection matters in the North City. Because some Japanese residents were unwilling to acknowledge and pay the tax, he was eager to negotiate, compelling them to comply and pay uniformly. Therefore, he requested Director Xu to appoint Tang Zhenchao, who is familiar with the situation of Japanese residents and proficient in Japanese, as an investigator of overseas merchants. Recently, Director Xu, accompanied by Investigator Tang, made an appointment with Japanese leaders (Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Roads Federation) Lin Xionggji, (Member) Kobayashi Kaname, (Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Japanese Roads Federation) Kondo Mitsuru, and (Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Conference) Ohtsuki Shigeru, at No. 69 Wenlu Road to hold a discussion. After meeting, they exchanged business cards and took their seats. Director Xu spoke first, saying, "I have come here today to visit regarding the collection of house tax in the North City, which is under my responsibility. Some of your country's residents have paid, while many have not. There may be some misunderstandings, so I have come specifically to explain. In the past, it was called 'general tax,' with residents paying 6% and businesses paying 10%. Although it was called 'general tax,' there were still many other taxes, such as security and fire protection. Not only did your country's residents find it troublesome, but so did our own citizens. Therefore, the municipal government decided at a meeting in the 18th year of the Republic [1929] to cancel all other items and change it to house tax, with residents paying 10% and businesses paying 14%, split equally between landlord and tenant. The tenants pay on behalf of the landlords and deduct it when paying rent. The residents may have misunderstood due to the sudden increase in the tax rate, not knowing that the house tax is split equally between landlord and tenant. For residents, the 10% is actually only 5%, and for businesses, the 14% is actually only 7%, which is actually less than the old 'general tax.' Also, I saw on your association's leaflets that although the landlord and tenant are nominally each paying half, the landlord can easily increase the rent, resulting in the tenant bearing the entire burden. I am unaware that the municipal government has previously rejected a request from the tenants' association to not allow rent increases. Whether or not an increase should be made should be agreed upon by both landlord and tenant for it to take effect. The residents also mistakenly believe that paying tax on behalf of the landlord is a misunderstanding." Lin Xionggji, Kondo Mitsuru, and Ohtsuki Shigeru then spoke, saying, "Director Xu's visit today to explain the various points has certainly clarified some misunderstandings." They then asked, "Are the taxes graded?" Director Xu replied, "Yes, they are divided into housing and shops. Housing is 10%, meaning one yuan per month for every ten yuan of rent, collected quarterly at three yuan, split equally between landlord and tenant. Shops are 14%, calculated in the same manner." They asked, "Can the director collect the landlord's share directly to avoid the landlord refusing to acknowledge payment, causing the tenant to be oppressed by both sides?" Director Xu replied, "The city government's regulations seem difficult to change. If the landlord refuses to acknowledge it, it is a violation of the tax rate, and the city government will have a way to deal with it. Besides, how could a landlord be willing to forfeit a large amount of rent for the sake of a small amount of tax?" The gentlemen also said, "The house tax issue has been unresolved for several years since Ding Wenjiang's negotiations in 1926. Now that Director Xu has come here, both sides can explain the various points. We will persuade the residents to pay the tax according to regulations. However, it would still be best if the director collected the landlord's share directly to avoid complications. Special attention should also be paid to hygiene and police matters." The conversation lasted for three hours. The gentlemen invited Director Xu and Tang to lunch at the club, and the host and guests parted on amicable terms.</p>

<p>▲ Thirtieth Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee held its thirtieth regular meeting yesterday. Lu Jingshi chaired the meeting, and Liu Yunqian served as the recording secretary. The procedural matters were conducted as usual. Matters for discussion: (1) Regarding the order from the Municipal Citizen Training Committee to dismiss Xu Shirong from his position to uphold party discipline, it was resolved to discuss it together with the second item. (2) A Standing Committee member brought up the issue of a report from employee Xu Pu, stating that he had been accused of changing his name and expelled from the party, but this had not yet been approved by the central authorities, and he still held the position of Standing Committee member of the district branch. He has already appealed to the municipal party headquarters and requested permission to forward his appeal. How should this matter be handled? Resolution: Forwarded to the Municipal Party Headquarters. (3) A Standing Committee member raised the issue of a letter from the China Merchants Electric Power Company, stating that the work of our committee member Tang Junsheng had already been reduced by half, and the period had expired. Please inform us to avoid hindering business. Resolution: Reply by letter and request the Municipal Citizen Training Committee to extend the period again. (4) A Standing Committee member raised the issue of a letter from the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Headquarters, sending the organizational outline of the May Revolution Festival and requesting a reply and the nomination of representatives. (Resolution) Nominate Committee Member Jin Yongchang to participate and reply. (5) A Standing Committee member raised the issue that Nanjing Special Mayor Liu Jiwen violated the Premier's [Sun Yat-sen's] teachings, disregarded the people's livelihood, and demolished residential houses. Now it is heard that he will come to Shanghai to take up the post of Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs. Our association should express opposition. (Resolution) Request the Municipal Executive Committee to forward it to the Central Government to consult the National Government and immediately withdraw the order. (6) A Standing Committee member raised the issue of a report from the General Affairs Office of the Commercial Press Employees' Union, stating that the treatment was unfair and negotiations were ineffective.

(Resolution) Refer to the Guidance Section for investigation and reply. (9) A Standing Committee member raised the issue of a letter from the Preparatory Committee of the Wuchang Uprising Wounded Soldiers Factory requesting fundraising and asking for staff to assist in everything to facilitate fundraising and avoid setbacks. (Resolution) Reply by letter. (10) The Guidance Section raised the issue of a report from Jiang Menggu, the former executive committee member of the Photography Workers' Union, accusing the current executive committee member Yuan Dongsheng of controlling the union affairs and making false accusations. Please investigate. The section has repeatedly sent staff to investigate, but no one in charge of the union could be reached, making investigation impossible. This shows that the union's affairs have been extremely neglected. How should this be handled? Please make a decision. (Resolution) Request the Municipal Citizen Training Committee to send staff to reorganize. (11) Zhang Yaokuan and others raised the issue that recently a small newspaper called "Revolutionary Workers" was found to have absurd wording and reactionary opinions, and even attacked the Municipal Party Headquarters and members of our association, fabricating rumors in thin air and causing harm. It is truly an incitement to the people and extremely reactionary. It should be submitted to the Municipal Headquarters for thorough and strict investigation to warn against illegal activities. Is this appropriate? Please make a decision. (Resolution) Passed. (12) Standing Committee member brought up that representatives from the Suzhou Rice and Pawn Shop Workers' Union came to Shanghai stating that the local authorities in Suzhou, acting on government orders, did not allow the establishment of trade unions, and all members of established trade unions must be changed to the same industry guild. Such a chaotic organization hinders the labor movement and requests uniform assistance. Today, a discussion meeting was convened with the trade unions in this city to discuss assistance measures. Please ratify the action. (Resolution) Ratified and passed. (13) Standing Committee member raised the issue that regarding the various commemorative festivals in May, the Municipal Headquarters has already organized the May Revolution Commemoration Committee, and the World Labor Day is approaching in an instant. It should be requested to the Municipal Headquarters to instruct the May Revolution Commemoration Committee to be established as soon as possible, and prepare for a grand commemoration on May 1. Is this appropriate? Please make a decision. (Resolution) Passed.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association Telegraphs Request to Stop Fujian Province's Tobacco Monopoly System <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association previously received a telegram from the Xiamen Cigarette Merchant Association, and member cigarette factories have successively reported that the Zhangquan Financial Reorganization Committee of Fujian Province plans to establish a local monopoly system for tobacco and alcohol, establish an office, and set rules. It is determined to implement it. The local cigarette merchants have opposed it to no avail, resulting in the closure of all Chinese cigarette factories in the area. Upon receiving the report, the association immediately outlined the key points and appealed to the Cigarette Unified Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance to stop it according to law. It is heard that the association received a reply from the Unified Tax Office yesterday, stating that it had strictly consulted the Fujian Provincial Government, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and ordered the Fujian Cigarette Unified Tax Bureau to take separate measures to stop it. The text of the reply is recorded below. (Titles omitted) "Received your association's letter stating that the Zhangquan Financial Reorganization Committee of Fujian Province will implement a tobacco and alcohol monopoly system on April 1, and attached a copy of the regulations formulated by the office, requesting to stop it. The cigarette monopoly fundamentally conflicts with the unified tax regulations and is inappropriate. In addition to strictly consulting the Fujian Provincial Government and the Ministry of Military Affairs, we have ordered the Fujian Cigarette Unified Tax Bureau to take separate measures to stop it. We hereby reply for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e158">Disaster Survey Diary of the Xinghua Branch of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Lu Henry, the Western Chairman of the Xinghua Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and Hong Youxin, the Chinese Chairman, reported in person to the Shanghai Association the day before yesterday, saying, "What we have witnessed during this survey is a particularly tragic disaster situation. Moreover, as spring has just begun, all grain seeds have been exhausted, and there are no resources for cultivation. Even in the eastern countryside, although there are wheat fields, most have been sown but have not sprouted. Those that have sprouted are also suffering from insect pests and will soon wither. In this situation, the victims are in dire straits and can barely survive. Their lives have no hope. If we do not cry out for relief, watching hundreds of thousands of victims suffer the same great catastrophe, we are not made of iron and stone, how can we bear it? Furthermore, if they cannot find food, they will inevitably resort to desperate measures. The world is in turmoil, and hidden worries will never end. The urgency of spring relief is ten times greater than winter relief." They also presented handwritten diaries, recorded as follows: "We five personally went to the countryside to inspect the disaster situation and made a brief report. On the first day, from Xinghua to Cha'an, Tangzi Town, and Xin Town, we saw very few wheat fields, and the farmers were extremely distressed. We also went to Supilin, Tantan, Xinzhuang, and Heta Weirs. These places have always relied entirely on wheat fields for their livelihood. This year, due to fleeing outwards, the fields have been left barren. In Xinzhuang Weir, we saw a woman surnamed Wu with six children who had not eaten for three days and wanted to commit suicide. Fortunately, they immediately received more than a peck of wheat bran, saving her family's life. On the second day, we braved the rain to go to Baiju to see the porridge factory. More than a thousand hungry people had already come, waiting for porridge to eat. Most had traveled from more than fifteen miles away, all with yellow faces and thin skin. We took five photos. Afterwards, we went to the east side of Lao Weir to inspect. The disaster was particularly severe, and there had been no harvest for two years. Everything was barren. Even if there was wheat, it had already withered, and there were also earthworms in the fields, damaging the wheat roots. It was truly a human tragedy. We also saw Zhanglin, Wanzhuang, and Zhu Peng's three villages. They had already run out of food and were eating grass roots and tree bark to survive. The Central Weir in the fifth district was even more miserable than Lao Weir. On the third day, we went to Anfeng to see the porridge factory. More than a thousand victims had already come, begging for food from the porridge cook. The situation was very distressing. We specially took several photos. We also went to Daying and saw that the victims receiving porridge were all coming by boat from afar. Dozens of people in each boat, braving the rain and enduring hunger, were shivering all over, which was even more miserable. We returned to Yongfeng Weir and other places. Six out of ten families had sealed their doors with mud and fled to various places in Jiangnan to escape the famine. The remaining victims were all eating grass roots and wild vegetables. Chickens and dogs had long disappeared, and the fields were all dry and barren. All the victims were so hungry that they had only bones and no flesh, which made people weep. The disaster situation was so severe that we have reported it accordingly." It is heard that the Shanghai Association has allocated six thousand yuan, which is only a drop in the bucket. They are currently seeking assistance from all walks of life.</p>

<p>Ningbo native Liu Siqiao was run over by a car driven by Guangdong native Pan Shiju on the Great Western Road in Shanghai on July 7th, while riding in a rickshaw hired. The family has hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a lawsuit according to law. It has been reported previously. Liu Jun was proficient in medicine and made great contributions to the medical community. His translated "Huang Han Medical Science" is about to be published. The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association was shocked by the news and very indignant, believing that the circumstances of the incident that day with the Guangdong native Pan Shiju were more than mere negligence. Without a severe sentence, how can humanity be upheld? In addition to expressing deep condolences for Liu Jun's tragic death, the association will convene a committee to discuss actively pursuing aid for the case.</p>

<p>During February, the Chinese Jisheng Society publicly appointed Feng, Li, and Gu to serve as directors in Yongjia, Leqing, Yuhuan, and Ruian counties in the Wen District to handle spring relief efforts. Nearly two months have passed, and the efforts are now coming to an end. Yesterday, the society received a telegram from Feng Jun Yangshan in Wenzhou, stating that on the 18th of this month, he would accompany dozens of relief workers from Wenzhou to designated locations in Taiwan Prefecture to handle spring relief efforts. It is heard that the society has purchased 50,000 bags of flour at a low price from Fufeng, Yutong, Fuxin, Shenda, and Huafeng factories, which will be shipped from Shanghai to Taiwan immediately to relieve the dying victims. However, the funds needed are vast. Many enthusiastic people in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang will surely do their best to help and save them from this great catastrophe.</p>

<p>▲ Both Defendants Evasive</p>
<p>Chen Shiliang, a Jiangbei native of Hujia Wood Bridge, Linping Road, North Shanghai, had a daughter-in-law raised from childhood, Xiao Yuzi, aged fifteen. On March 12th of this year, at 5:00 PM, she disappeared after finishing work at the factory and returning home. Chen searched repeatedly without success. Later, neighbors Liu Wansong and Zhou San also disappeared at the same time, leading to great suspicion. Now that these people have suddenly reappeared, Chen believes that there are clues to be found from Liu, Zhou, and others. He reported to the police, and they were detained in the Third Precinct of the Fifth District. According to Chen Shiliang's statement, the defendants confessed to luring his daughter-in-law to Zhenjiang first, but there were no customers. They then returned to Shanghai and sold her to an opium den behind the Great World for 140 yuan. When questioned, the defendants were evasive. They were all sent to the local court for questioning.</p>

<p>▲ Devouring Banknotes</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Suiyang steamship, coming from Xiamen to Shanghai, was passing the Gaoqiao wharf when one of the passenger soldiers suddenly walked to the deck and jumped into the river. Fortunately, Shi Haichun and others who were receiving guests at the New Inn saw him and immediately tried to rescue him, allowing him to regain his life. He was then sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM to be placed. After preliminary interrogation by Captain Xu, he stated his name was Bu Rong, 33 years old, from Hunan. He was a clerk in the Second Battalion of the 46th Regiment of the Eighth Division of the National Revolutionary Army. Recently, he received a letter from home, learning that his elderly father had passed away. He immediately asked for leave and boarded the Suiyang steamship to Shanghai, preparing to transfer to another ship to return to Hunan. Unexpectedly, on the Suiyang steamship, several stragglers suddenly robbed him of all the 42 yuan he had with him and tried to harm him. He was so frightened that he had no choice but to throw himself into the river to commit suicide. Later, Qu Wuqiao, the company commander of the Artillery Battalion of the 50th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, reported to the team that Bu Rong had recently suffered from mental illness, causing him to be mentally disturbed. When he was on the steamship, he threw teapots, teacups, and other items, and put the banknotes he had with him into his mouth and chewed them wildly. Therefore, under his witness, he took his funds for safekeeping. His luggage is now stored in the Taian Hotel. Please verify. Seeing Bu Rong's attitude, the captain thought that he seemed to be suffering from a mental illness and immediately sent police to the Taian Hotel to retrieve his luggage, along with all his funds, and submitted a report to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>

<p>The home of Xue Genlin at No. 12 Qianjia Lane, Yanjiadian, Difeng Road, West Shanghai, was suddenly visited by three or four robbers yesterday morning at around 3:00 AM. They opened the door with a matching key and entered. Everyone was asleep. The robbers did not make a sound and immediately ransacked the chests and cabinets, searching for dozens of pieces of clothing, which they packed into two large packages. Just as the robbers were about to escape with the stolen goods, everyone woke up and noticed, getting up. The robbers became menacing, holding pistols to scare them into silence. They fled one after another with the stolen goods, which is what is called "soft entry, hard exit." Afterwards, the victims, Xue Genlin and Zhao Juting, filed a report with the Sixth District Police Station, requesting the pursuit of the stolen goods and robbers. It is said that the loss was over 600 yuan.</p>

According to Chief Inspector McGeilivry of the Old Gate Patrol Room, the defendant attempted to enter the library on the side of the Indian Municipal Hall. Because of the taxpayers' annual meeting, the door was temporarily closed. The defendant kicked the door, and the patrol tried to stop him, but he refused to obey and threatened him with dangerous words. He then used force, assaulting two Indian constables, and was then taken to the patrol room. The defendant stated that he was 21 years old and currently residing in Shanghai, and admitted to his actions. The questioning official sentenced the defendant to seven days in prison and required a guarantor to ensure his future good behavior. If he could not find a guarantor, he would be deported back to India.</p>

<p>The case of the tenement residents of Zhen'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, where the landlord cut off the water supply and forcibly erected bamboo fences under the pretext of rebuilding houses, causing a conflict, has been ongoing for many days. Fearing further oppression by the landlord, the residents held a temporary emergency meeting at No. 10 of the lane yesterday afternoon at 8:00 PM to prevent such incidents. All residents, except for two, were present, totaling over one hundred people. General Representative Ge Fulong was elected chairman. After the report, they discussed the matter together. General Representative Li Shuangyu spoke about the facts of the losses, and Representatives Zheng Dun, Sun Linfu, Wu Zhangshi, and Shen Lishi all applauded and agreed. The chairman put it to a vote, and everyone rejected the landlord's behavior and declared that the residents' purpose was to seek housing, not money. Next, they discussed methods of seeking external assistance and resolved to issue a declaration in the name of the Housing Association and to inform all citizens of the illegal oppression and the suffering of the residents. Finally, the chairman reported that according to the Municipal Party Headquarters, they had sent staff to secretly investigate the details of the case and that the Municipal Housing Association had sent a letter. The discussion on financial issues was enthusiastic, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association sent a letter to Mr. Fevrier of the French General Patrol Room yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, we have found that landlords in the French Concession often evict tenants, using coercive means such as surrounding them with bamboo fences, and colluding with water and electricity workers to cut off water and electricity. We have also found police officers present at the scene to help them. The industrial and police organs were originally established to protect the local area and maintain law and order and should not be controlled by the landlord. Moreover, violating public opinion for private interests is even more intolerable by law. The association's responsibility lies in this, and it is difficult to stand idly by. If it is not immediately corrected, the disturbances will inevitably worsen. Therefore, we have attached a petition from the Zhen'an Lane Residents' Association and respectfully ask that you, as the general supervisor, consider the will of the people, strictly prohibit such behavior, and provide a reply to reassure the public."</p>

<h3 id="e171">Business Report of American Asiatic Life Insurance Company <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The American Asiatic Life Insurance Company held a shareholders' meeting the day before yesterday. General Manager Mr. Steere reported on the business situation for the year 1929, stating briefly that the company's effective insurance amount has now increased to 6,830,930 yuan, with a total amount reaching 24,098,486 yuan. The company's assets have increased to 1,452,198 yuan and 94 cents, the reserve has increased by 493,539 yuan and 31 cents, and the net surplus is 54,709 yuan and 02 cents. In 1929, the amount paid to policyholders and their parents, wives, and children reached 207,826 yuan and 24 cents. The mortality rate in China is recently considered exceptionally good. In the company's past nine years of history, the mortality rate in Shanghai has been lower than the ordinary standard in the United States. Southern China also has exceptional records. In China, only two places, Fuzhou and Hankou, have higher mortality rates than usual. The mortality rate in the Philippines is higher than the average, but the company has not been operating there for long, and our experience cannot be used to draw conclusions. The mortality rate in French Annam is very good, but it cannot be taken as a definite conclusion, as the operating period is only two years. The company's business area expanded to Java, the Malay Archipelago, and the South Sea Islands in 1929. However, operations in the Kingdom of Luo Luo have been suspended because the local courts cannot protect life insurance companies in cases of fraudulent claims. In one case, even though there was insufficient evidence of the policyholder's death, the court ruled that the company should pay compensation. Several months later, the company discovered the policyholder who falsely claimed to be dead, and handed him over to the police station. This person may still be in prison, but the insurance money paid by the company has not yet been recovered. In another case, even though the company had a certificate from the Ministry of Interior of the local government proving that there was no evidence of the policyholder's death, it still had to pay compensation. Although the political situation in China has been constantly turbulent in recent years, the life insurance business has become an economic organization of the country and is gradually progressing. The company's board of directors firmly believes that this situation is of great benefit to the future of American Asiatic operations. Last year, an independent division was established, specializing in the sale of accidental injury and health insurance, under the leadership of Mr. Gao Luosen. The ability of this division to work has led to the company's plan to realize its independent organization in the near future, so that it can specialize in managing American Asiatic's accident and health insurance.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Welcoming President Chiang's Visit <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong from Xuzhou</p>
<p>The situation of Chairman Chiang's visit to Xuzhou has been detailed in various newspapers. However, there are still anecdotes and scattered news that were not recorded by various newspapers. I have selected them and recorded them. It is also a good story of welcoming Chiang.</p>
<p>▲Mourning at the Martyrs' Cemetery The Martyrs' Cemetery at the foot of Yunlong Mountain in the south of the city is where the remains of the martyrs of the First Army of the Northern Expedition are placed. It was built in the winter of the 17th year and rebuilt in the summer of the 18th year. It has recently been expanded to bury the fallen soldiers of the First Division in successive campaigns against the rebels. It is already under construction. Chairman Chiang, after getting off the car in the early morning, summoned the generals at the Second Route Headquarters and then took a car to the cemetery to mourn. Those who accompanied him were Liu Zhi, Gu Zhutong, Han Fuqu, Ma Hongkui, He Yaogzu, Chen Jicheng, and Xu Tingyao and other important generals. At that time, the reporters sent telegrams to the Second Route Headquarters, the railway station, No. 1 Room of the Longhai Road, and Jiulishan, but they did not find the whereabouts of the chairman. Therefore, there was no such news in the newspapers, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>▲Summoning the Children Chairman Chiang once visited Yunlong Mountain during the Northern Expedition in the past. He met a young child, Zhang Shaoxin, of a photographer and loved him very much. He called him a little friend. He once took him to the General Headquarters to play. Later, whenever he came to Xuzhou, he would summon him whenever he had time. This time, when he arrived at the Martyrs' Cemetery, he remembered the little friend again. He sent someone to summon him. Chiang stood on the altar of the cemetery and said to him, "Little friend, I haven't seen you for more than a year." Zhang replied, "I haven't seen the Chairman for more than a year. Now it's the third Northern Expedition." Chiang also asked Zhang what his family did now. Zhang replied that he was taking pictures in the mountain. When Chiang heard this, he said, "Very good. Let's take pictures." So the Chairman and the generals went to Yunlong Mountain to take a photo. Zhang carried the camera for his father. Chiang praised him very much. I visited Yunlong Mountain yesterday and went to Zhang's Jiyun Photo Studio. I asked Zhang Shaoxin what he said and saw the group photo of Chiang and the generals. It is not a fiction. Zhang is 15 years old this year and is studying at Hubushan Elementary School.</p>
<p>▲Photography of Yunlong Mountain After Chiang visited the Martyrs' Cemetery, he took photos with the generals on the west slope of Yunlong Mountain. Chiang wore a black cloak. Those who took photos with him were Han Fuqu, Liu Zhi, Ma Hongkui, He Yaogzu, Gu Zhutong, Chen Jicheng, Xu Tingyao, etc. There is the three-character inscription "Yunlong Mountain" written by Mo Yuqi, the right counselor of Xuzhou Military Preparation in the 14th year of Wanli of the Ming Dynasty. There is also the inscription written by Mr. Dai Jitao when he visited Xuzhou last year. The stone wall has been chiseled and is still waiting to be published. (Payment required)</p>

<p>— Ma Zuqian</p>
<p>When sitting in a train car and looking out the window, never face the front of the train, because the coal smoke will blow into your eyes.</p>
<p>▲In the third- or fourth-class cabins of Yangtze River steamers or trains, people often walk around and shout, "Beware of hairy hands." You must not use your hands to touch your body to see if your money is still there, otherwise you will be deceived. Knowing where your money is makes it easier to steal.</p>
<p>▲Eyeglasses must be wiped and placed properly so that no scratches appear on the glass surface. Otherwise, not only will they not help your eyesight, but they will also cause headaches and dizziness from time to time.</p>
<p>▲When using a towel in a public place such as a bathhouse or tavern to wipe your face, you must close your eyes tightly, lest there be淋菌 on it, which can cause blindness or other eye diseases, which are enough to harm your eye health.</p>
<p>▲Clenching your teeth every time you urinate can prevent your teeth from falling out for life. They will be firm and free from disease. Books have also said this. I saw an 81-year-old man in Shanghai who could eat peanuts. He said he used this method. Fortunately, it doesn't cost much. Why don't everyone do this? Getting healthy teeth is a kind of happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Grave Talk <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Regarding graves, Shuowen says, "Mounds." Zheng Sinong said that it is the land of tombs, a place for filial sons to remember. Therefore, it is called a grave. In the Zhouli Chun Guan, the grave minister is in charge. He makes a map of the territory of all the graves in the country and orders the people to be buried there. He listens to the lawsuits for those who fight for the grave land. He leads his subordinates to patrol the graves. It is said that the graves are limited to the concealed places. Commoners do not seal or plant trees. Therefore, it is not called a mound but a grave. Yangzi Fangyan says, "All burials without mounds are called graves, and burials with mounds are called graves." Therefore, Tanjing says, "A grave without a mound." Also, a flat grave is called a mound, and a high one is called a grave. However, it is also said that the ancients did not repair graves. Easy graves are not ancient. Their system is different from the current mixed use of the word "grave."</p>
<p>The common saying is "hanging the grave," but it is not known when it started. In the Spring and Autumn period, Yanling Jizi passed by the lord of Xu in the north. The lord of Xu liked Jizi's sword but dared not say it. Jizi knew it in his heart. He was sent to the upper country and did not offer it. When he returned to Xu, the lord of Xu had already died. Therefore, he took off the sword and tied it to the tree of the lord of Xu's tomb and left. His followers said, "The lord of Xu is dead, who should I give it to?" Jizi said, "No, I promised it in my heart. How can I betray my heart because of death?" This is recorded in the Longmen Historical Records. It is said to be "hanging the sword." Today, people call it "hanging the grave." It has a source, but its meaning is not.</p>
<p>Some say it is "sweeping the grave," not "hanging the grave." However, the Wu people read the sound of "grave" like "wu," which is the same as the "mu" of farmland, and they do not pronounce the correct sound. As for those who hang paper money on the grave, this thing is also called "grave" sound, but they say "wu." When people hear it suddenly, they almost don't understand what it means. It is really laughable. In the past, people took pride in obtaining the graves of their ancestors, but those who had a comprehensive view said that the person was dead and his ghost was not working. Has anyone ever seen wine and meat carried into the Nine Springs? A Song poem says, "Paper ashes fly like white butterflies, tears and blood dye red azaleas." It also says, "Who knows who is wise or foolish after a thousand years? The eyes are full of artemisia and they share a mound." It can also be said that he has spoken enough.</p>
<p>At this time of the Qingming Festival, stepping out of the city gate for a few steps, one can often see people wandering among the withered grass and barren land. Before long, a pig's trotter and several lines of wine are offered. The widows and weak concubines worship and offer. The smell of wine and meat fills the fields. The sound of crying is sad, corresponding to the sound of the pine trees. Looking at those beside them, they also sigh with emotion. However, this is the so-called green tomb. Although the person is dead, his bones have not yet cooled. If he lived in a splendid house, he would fall and return to the mountains and hills. The shepherd boys and woodcutters cut down the grave trees as firewood. The cunning rabbits and plump foxes dig up the grave fields to compete for holes. Even if there are broken steles and broken monuments, they fall by the roadside, and no one knows their surnames. Moreover, the barren tombs are piled up, and they are full of sight. And those who can not point to the grave door and sigh are few and far between. Thirty years ago, my country had a problem with being full of people. Some say there is no worry, but the worry is that the ghosts are full. Ghosts are full, which refers to the graveyard. Now I think it is true.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Random Notes on Wandering in America at the Zhuiyu Xuan <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Wanhua's visit to the United States this time received unparalleled welcome, and to receive unparalleled welcome with pure old Chinese drama was even more unexpected. There are indeed those who are experts in the field and study with their hearts here. I have already recorded the criticisms of Mr. Yang (a famous American writer), Stark Young. Now I will record his recent talks as follows.</p>
<p>In the second appearance of Fenhe Bay, he used his hands to sweep the dustpan. When the Chinese looked at the lost Xue Mu, he only swept it once in the first performance. After that, he swept it two or three times in a row, which was not as beautiful as the first time. (According to what was said in the first time, it was a body movement in the play, and what was done later was closer to the realistic school, so it is said that Mr. Yang is an expert.) Because the male lead is not very good, Mr. Mei reduced the highlights. If he had a good supporting role, Mr. Mei would be several times better. I think Mr. Mei's performance in China will be better than this. Performing here seems to be accommodating the Americans. I advise Mr. Mei not to do this, so as not to damage the value of Chinese drama. Those who come to see Mr. Mei's drama this time all view it from a very noble artistic point of view, or from an ancient sculpture point of view. Therefore, if there are places that they don't understand, it is not a hindrance at all. The more it is performed according to the old Chinese drama style, the more welcome and interested everyone is. Chinese drama is graceful and elegant, and its high position and heavy weight are the crown of world drama. I have learned a lot about the principles of drama and the principles of world art from watching Mr. Mei's this time. It is really very pleasant. I think Mr. Mei's voice is very good, but he seems to be afraid to sing hard. In fact, it doesn't matter. Now that New Yorkers have recognized Chinese drama as a world art, Mr. Mei should do his best to develop the inherent strengths of China. The more you develop, the more welcome you will be, because everyone is not here for entertainment, but for research. It is to study Eastern art. Therefore, Mr. Mei must not be discouraged, so as not to damage the value of Mr. Mei's art and the status of Chinese drama. Every few years in the United States, there will be a "Duo Jin Biao," which refers to people who are watched by the whole country. People from all walks of life, whether political or academic, are all in it. The "Duo Jin Biao" in recent years is Mr. Mei.</p>
<p>The above is the general idea of what Mr. Yang discussed. Mr. Yang's expertise is really convincing. Whenever Wanhua makes a slight change in the play, he will know it. Therefore, Wan is also very careful. Each time, there must be a certain place, otherwise someone will ask questions. Mr. Yang also said that the self-immolation of the tiger in the first performance was much better than the later ones. It can be seen that the audience is attentive.</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Record of Li Jilui <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Gong</p>
<p>Li Jilui, an old man of literature and martial arts, is over sixty years old, and he is as healthy as ever. He has been away from the stage for ten years. This time, Chang Yunheng of the Shanghai stage made a special trip to the north to recruit him with courtesy, and it was difficult to refuse his kindness. He had no choice but to go south alone. Therefore, he returned to the stage, and it was a pleasant surprise to see him again on the red carpet with the folks in Chun Shen.</p>
<p>Li's fame was far away forty years ago. In the early years of the Republic of China, he enjoyed great fame in Beijing and Tianjin. He once came to Shanghai to perform for a month at the invitation of a certain stage. I once listened to his dramas such as "Falling Horse Lake" and "The Chain Set," and I was amazed. This time, I did not expect to meet him again. In recent days, I have also enjoyed his masterpieces such as "The Storm Pavilion," "Nine Righteous Men and Eighteen Heroes," and "Crouching Tiger Ridge." He is full of energy and his steps are from the guest. Looking at him is like a man in his thirties, and his style is not reduced at that time, but his subtlety is even better. His magnificent voice is beyond the reach of other actors. Looking at his meticulous expression and his crisp speech, it is as if he is meeting with ancient heroes. It can't help but make people feel lofty and courageous. When he plays Yue Wang in "The Storm Pavilion," his loyalty and righteousness are like a flash of lightning. His understanding is unique. It can be known that the success of art cannot be expected by luck or chance.</p>
<p>The drama "Hong Bi Yuan" is adapted from the novel "Green Peony." Li once compiled it into this drama and performed it in Beijing and Tianjin. Later, Lu Yueqiao directed it in the Chun Shen River. For a time, the audience praised it and the box office was unprecedented. This time, Li has agreed to write and arrange it. He will soon meet the audience. It is also good news for those who are fond of Zhou Lang. Mr. Sun Juxian, an old fellow villager, heard that he would arrive around the age of twenty or join the stage before Li's departure. Sun is ninety years old this year. It is said that his singing and chanting are still like in the past, but his ears are slightly deaf. However, with the proper accompaniment of the Huqin, there will be no mistakes. At that time, two old men of ninety-six and one hundred and fifty years old will work together, which is also a new record in the Shanghai theater industry.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Crimson Flames Soar, Theater Praises Filial Daughter; Red Carpet Lies Flat, Meeting Famous Actor Ah Jin on the Spot. "Never mind him. You said someone almost burned to death. Are you talking about the old woman?" A Bao said, "Of course. At that time, Miss Wen Guizhi the Third had just finished her stage performance. Many people upstairs all ran down. Everyone didn't know how the fire started. Luckily, the people in the theater sleep late. Everyone hadn't gone to bed yet. If it had been in the middle of the night, it would have been terrible. At this moment, everyone was accounted for, except for that old woman, who hadn't come downstairs yet. Miss Wen Guizhi the Third said, 'Oh no, that's terrible! Good Grandma hasn't come down. She's partially paralyzed. She has some hemiplegic problems. What can we do?' Looking at the handrail, it was filled with smoke, and even the electric lights couldn't be seen clearly. Then the Third Miss desperately rushed upstairs, shouting 'Good Grandma, Good Grandma, my Good Grandma.' Everyone saw her rushing upstairs and felt it was very dangerous, so they went to pull her back. Strangely, at this moment, she didn't know where she got the strength from. On ordinary days, she was so delicate that she seemed like she could be blown over by the wind. At this moment, her strength was extraordinary. No one could stop her. She said, 'The handrail hasn't been burned through yet, so it's okay. She lives very close to the handrail. If I grab her, I can drag her down, because the fire started very close to the handrail. If the handrail is burned through, it will be difficult.' At this moment, she rushed onto the handrail. Many people were sweating for her, shouting, 'Third Miss, come down quickly! Third Miss, come down quickly!' Her grandmother was originally suffering from paralysis. Now she couldn't stand such a fright. She was so frightened that she couldn't walk a step. That old woman also happened to be a big, heavy person. The Third Miss didn't care about anything. She carried her grandmother on her back, regardless of the consequences. The two of them reached the handrail, like rolling gourds. The two of them rolled down. We thought they must have been injured, but fortunately, they were not injured. In short, if the old woman didn't have this good granddaughter, she would have certainly been burned to death today. Everyone said that Miss Wen Guizhi the Third was truly filial, risking her life to save her grandmother. Just three minutes later, the handrail was burned through. Don't you think it was dangerous?" Ah Jin said, "It really was dangerous. If it were another young lady, she would have saved her own life. How could she have been willing to take this risk to save her grandmother? Did Wen Guizhi manage to salvage any of her jewelry or clothes?" A Bao said, "Apart from the jewelry she was wearing on her head and arms, because she had just finished her stage performance and hadn't taken them off, the rest in the room were all burned. It goes without saying about the clothes. There was no time to salvage the clothing chests. But Wen Guizhi didn't care at all. She said that clothes and jewelry were external things. If they were burned, she could buy them again in the future. As long as she saved her good grandma, she would be satisfied."</p>

<h3 id="e183">Commercial News: Gold Market Mediocre After Financial Swap <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>▲Dealers Mostly Even</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold price jumped happily, market atmosphere was calm, only a difference of two taels in spot price, dealers seemed to be evening out positions, likely because banks are closing today (the 18th) and the market will be closed for four days. There was also no change in foreign exchange, and firms like Dadecheng, Yongfeng, and Fuyu bought slightly, while Wanxing, Shunli, and Yufengyong mostly sold. Early in the morning, large silver bars rose slightly, but did not move in the morning. Later, buyers were enthusiastic, briefly exceeding the 500 tael mark, but as the exchange rate eased and sellers returned, it gradually declined, breaking below 499 taels. In the afternoon, Wanxing and Hengxing bought slightly, while sellers were scattered. Prices were mediocre, with only one tael of spot exchange rotating steadily. Recent Japanese gold settled at 1 tael 0.04875, forward price 1 tael 0.04125. Forward British gold was available at 11 pence 375.</p>
<p>▲Briefly Jumped Above 500 Taels After 10 AM Yesterday, British silver bars rose by 1/16 of a price plus 1/4. Exchange rates remained the same. June gold standard opened with national currency priced at 499 taels 1 mace. The gross margin rose from 98 taels 45 cents to 9 taels 34 cents due to persistent buyers and flat exchange rates. June British gold was sold by Sumitomo at 11 pence 13.375. Recent Shanghai Interbank Rate (SHIBOR) was mutually set at 1.875 between Wheat &amp; Co. The shilling rate remained unchanged, at 99 taels 45 cents, returning to 12 cents. The internal rate remained flat. Zhengjin (Yokohama Specie Bank) bought August Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.039375. It then seemed strong. Three Non-ferrous Metals Ltd. bought May at 1 tael 0.04625. Sumitomo and HSBC mutually traded British gold at 11 pence 25. Sumitomo again absorbed August at 11 pence 275. Chosen (Korea) bought August Japanese gold at 1 tael 0.04125 and buying activity increased, adding 1 tael, reaching 500 taels 02 cents at 10:00 AM.

<p>The yarn market is flat and sluggish, trending soft due to poor actual sales and rumors of political instability, weakening sentiment. The market lacks excitement. Although buyers are not letting go, short sellers are heavily scouring the market for spot yarn, preparing to deliver against standard contracts. Therefore, the situation is still in flux. Bulls and bears are fiercely competing, making it difficult to predict the current situation. After closing, Dafeng Firm took in 1,000 bales of Honghefeng (Red Lotus Bee) 10-count yarn, reportedly also for delivery to the exchange.</p>
<p>▲Morning Standard Rose, Afternoon Fell The opening market was excited by the sudden rise of American cotton by over thirty pounds. Retail investors made up for their positions, rising by 4 to 6 qian. However, No. 68 heavily sold in large quantities over the past three months, and the market suddenly eased. The second and third waves turned downward. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 4 qian, the middle month fell by 2 to 3 qian, and the far month rose by 1 qian.

<h3 id="e195">Grains: River Rice Market Steadily Firm <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, over ten sources from various gangs on the "Inside the Barriers" [i.e., Chinese-controlled areas of Shanghai] were selling well. Transactions in Gao Bai Jing [High Grade White Japonica Rice] from the Northern Gang were stagnant, and prices were flat. Medium and Lower grades of various Japonica rices from this area were selling more actively, but mainly in small quantities. Prices were steadily firming. Currently, stocks in the river [i.e., Yangtze River Delta region] are gradually decreasing. A few merchants, citing heavy costs, are keen to sell, so market prices are inevitably grading lower quality rice as medium and medium as high, resulting in an invisible rise in market prices. Genuine high-quality rice is met with mutual observation due to price limits. Early rice stocks are running low, and sales are brisk, with prices rising by a fraction of a cent. Top grade is opening at 19 taels. Sales of Yang Xian [Indica rice] are slightly slower, but prices remain firm. Du Xian [another type of Indica rice] is arriving and being sold immediately. The general market remained stable in the afternoon after news of a weakening foreign rice market. Bai Yuan [White Round-Grain rice] is gradually improving, with slight movement in customer sales and a slightly better price, up almost a cent.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: Not much coming from the river area, and the market remains active. Sales of machine-milled white Japonica rice from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongzhou vary slightly. However, a significant amount of rice is being shipped out of the interior of Pudong. Local merchants and customers are carefully buying up the rice. Merchants from Chongming, Qidong, and Tongzhou are also keen to buy, because after the sharp rise in foreign rice prices, they have mostly switched to buying rice from Tongli and other areas. As a result, Japonica rice prices here have risen by a fraction of a cent. Sales of Changzhou rice are normal. It has been determined that after the authorities established the Rice Price Stabilization Committee, it has now begun operations. It is unknown whether the grain market will shrink in the future. The prices of Southern early rice are all rising accordingly. Indica rice remains tight, and stores are eager to stock it. The market continues to be firm. Buying interest in Tongbian Yin Hua [a type of rice] is also improving. The situation is initially stable and then strengthens. Top grade rice is opening at 17 yuan and 8 jiao [角, 1/10 of a yuan].</p>
<h3 id="e196">Foreign Rice Futures and Spot Prices Both Fall <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice suddenly turned weak. Because of the upcoming customs closure today and the holiday the day after tomorrow [Sunday], customers are temporarily suspending business for customs clearance. The total market only opened with over 2,000 bags of spot goods. With few transactions, people's hearts were soft, and many were eager to dispose of their positions. Prices of various rice fell by a small amount, from 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half. Number One Saigon was 15 yuan and 6 jiao, small size 15 yuan, large size 14 yuan and 8 jiao. Futures followed spot prices in the same downward trend, falling by 4-5 fen [分, 1/100 of a yuan] to 7-8 fen. However, transactions were still good, with a total of over 2,000 tons opened in the market, of which small-size rice accounted for more than half, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Clear Weather Causes New Vermicelli to Fall Slightly <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the vermicelli market showed a trend of near-term strength and long-term weakness. For the current month, because the delivery date is approaching, the largest manufacturers have consistently maintained a "no-selling" policy. It is said that the major manufacturers have fully repurchased their contracts on the exchange side for this month. Although the smaller manufacturers have not repurchased their positions, the bulls have the major manufacturers as their backing and are not loosening their grip. Therefore, the current month is showing a small profit. As for long-term new vermicelli, due to the favorable weather, it is naturally softening in this sunny weather. Customers in Suzhou, Changzhou, and Jiangbei are selling actively, taking advantage of the good weather. It is said that only the Wuxi gang is stubbornly holding on. The shift in the future trend still depends on the weather as the key, because this kind of situation is almost entirely due to the psychological effect. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen compared to the previous day, May rose by 2.5 li [厘, 1/1000 of a tael], June rose by 5 li, and July to September each fell by 7.5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Main Reasons for the Recovery of the Wheat Market <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>▲ Foreign Wheat Prices Rise ··· Wuxi Gang Absorbs ··· Factory Purchases Also Eager</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market improved because foreign wheat prices had slightly recovered. In addition, the Wuxi gang ultimately felt that rice prices were becoming increasingly expensive. Considering the price ratio, the demand for new wheat remained very strong. According to industry insiders, the Wuxi gang had made huge profits on foreign rice this year, both in futures and spot, so their absorption of wheat was also smooth. They were not initially concerned about whether they would lose money. According to this situation, it is said that the inland gangs will not let go until June reaches 4 taels and 6 qian [錢, 1/10 of a tael]. As a result, the current month rose by 3 fen compared to the previous day, June rose by 1 fen, July remained unchanged, and August and September each rose by 2 fen. Spot wheat remained in demand from factories, and regardless of high or low quality, they were quite eager to buy. Therefore, asking prices were about 2-3 fen better than the previous day. Kainam, Suzhou, and Bengbu wheat were offered at 5 taels and 1 qian, 5 taels, 6-7 fen. Jiangxi and Hankou wheat were offered at 5 taels, 4 taels and 8 qian, 8 fen, 4 taels and 8 qian, and 4 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, for a total of over 8,600 bags, which were purchased by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Silk and Tea: Low Opening Price for Mulberry Leaves in Wuxi <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mulberry Trees Damaged by Weather ··· Price Only 2 Yuan, Few Transactions</p>
<p>Wuxi is a famous sericulture area in China. Raising silkworms and planting mulberry trees is a sideline for farmers. There are many mulberry fields in the surrounding villages. Last winter, due to the severe cold weather and heavy frost, the mulberry trees were damaged. During the Qingming Festival, the mulberry trees were budding, and the mulberry buds were beaten off by thunder and hail, and the leaf production will inevitably be greatly affected. Farmers in various cities and towns are in the process of hatching silkworm eggs. In view of this situation, they are rushing to buy silkworm ant feed. The mulberry leaf market opened at only 2 yuan per dan [担, a unit of weight], and few transactions were made. The leaf households are all waiting for a good price to sell. Due to the high prices demanded by Chinese merchants in the Shanghai silk market, transactions continued to be slow. Only Dachang and others brought in 30 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Xinfu and others brought in 30 packages of Baigan silk. Prices are all firm.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Russian Firm Continues to Purchase Gongxi Tea <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>After the sales of Gongxi green tea recovered in Russia, people's hearts were slightly more stable. Yesterday, Jinlong Foreign Firm purchased over 10,000 boxes from tea firms such as Qianji Yongshengchang, and the order has been placed by telegram from Russia. The agreed price is still 26-27 taels. It is found that there are still 12,000 boxes of Gongxi tea on the market. It is said that the firm has sent a telegram to continue negotiations, and it seems that it will not be difficult to clear the remaining stock. However, the firm of Basz is restricting foreign merchants from transporting Chinese tea to Russia, and the prices are generally high.</p>

<p>▲ Longji Trading Company announces that Messrs. Yang Liangbi, Wang Pingnan, Chen Baosan, Li Xiong, and Li Yueting, who are visiting Shanghai, are all outstanding talents in the business world. In view of the oppression of economic aggression and the hardship of the national economy, they know that revitalizing industry and commerce is not enough to achieve the goal of enriching the country and benefiting the people. Therefore, based on this idea, they have specially gathered capitalists to jointly establish the company, with the office located at No. 85 Qujiang Lane, at the intersection of Fujian Road and Hankou Road. Mr. Yang Liangbi was publicly elected as the manager, Mr. Li Xiong as the assistant manager, and Mr. Li Yueting as the business director. Various department heads were hired.

Therefore, more and more people have patronized the company, and the business is very developed.</p>
<p>▲ Shunfeng Brand Hosiery Factory announces that the domestic Shunfeng brand silk stockings have been praised by all walks of life for their durability. However, they have been sold through other companies in the past. Because they could not directly trade with customers, there was some separation between the company and the customers when purchasing silk stockings. Now, in view of this, the factory has specially established its first sales store at No. 547, Middle Henan Road, Qipan Street. In the future, they will gradually expand to appropriate locations to serve customers.

<p>▲ Shanghai Yongming Life Insurance Company announces that the company's manager, Mr. Harris, has recently received a telegram from the Yongming headquarters in Canada, reporting the business conditions for the year 1929 of the Western calendar. The business of that year was exceptionally developed, as stated in the telegram, and created a new record. The new business transacted that year, with premiums paid, totaled 654 million gold dollars. Compared with the new business of the previous year, 1928 of the Western calendar, which totaled 441 million gold dollars, it exceeded 213 million gold dollars. The total amount of life insurance undertaken now totals 2,401 million gold dollars, which is also an increase of 505 million gold dollars compared to the previous year. The company's assets at the end of last year, according to government estimates, were worth a total of 568 million gold dollars, which is also an increase of 80 million gold dollars compared to the previous year. In addition, the company's surplus and reserve for unforeseen events have also increased by 6 million gold dollars, now totaling 72 million gold dollars. Yongming's dividends to policyholders have always been excellent and will continue to be maintained. The special maturity bonus that was added last year will be expanded in scope. The dividends paid by all life insurance companies to policyholders in the world may not be higher than those of the company. In addition, Yongming's business in the United States has gradually developed last year. The second week of November is historically one of the darkest weeks in the financial world in the United States, and the new business transacted by Yongming during that week, with premiums paid, was more than the number transacted in any week since Yongming established a branch in the United States. Also, the new business transacted by Yongming in China last year exceeded half that of the previous year, which is also one of the most gratifying things in last year's work. Chinese people now attach great importance to life insurance, especially merchants, because they deeply know that we all have our own value in the economic sphere and cannot be treated equally. To plan for the safety of their families, they must consider how much each person is worth and insure that amount of life insurance. Yongming has recently established a Chinese business department, appointing Dr. Hao Aidi as the manager. Dr. Hao was formerly the senior American secretary of the Chinese Youth Association, so he is very familiar with the situation in China. Mr. Li Yuanxin was also appointed as the assistant manager. With these two gentlemen as leaders, Yongming's business among Chinese people is sure to grow day by day and month by month. Among the companies operating life insurance in China, there is no one with a more solid foundation than Yongming. It is sure to win the support and trust of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>▲ Miao Ji Company, North Sichuan Road, announces that the company held its ninth regular shareholders' meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the business accounts of the previous year and to re-elect directors and supervisors.

Now, at a great cost, a hair-styling technician who has just returned from Paris has been specially hired. He has carefully studied all kinds of perms and is no different from the styles permed in European and American countries. He is truly a leader in the Chinese hairdressing industry and opens a new era in the hairdressing industry. Starting this month, discount coupons will be sold, 16 coupons per book, for 1 yuan. There will also be a big giveaway to repay the kindness of our customers. The prices are also particularly low.</p>
<p>▲ Yizhong Company announces that Messrs. Kong, Ni, and Li of the company are experts in real estate construction and have been studying the problem of human habitation for many years. In view of the increasing real estate prices in Shanghai, the lack of good organization between landlords and tenants has led to misunderstandings and frequent disturbances. However, in terms of real estate value, Shanghai has not yet reached its peak. Not to mention Europe and the United States, even Hong Kong is higher than Shanghai. If real estate prices in the city continue to rise, it will be even more difficult for ordinary tenants to afford them. In order to eliminate this hidden worry, the company has been organized to create a kind of company housing that unites several tenants in one area, adopting the method of economic cooperation to provide tenants with various economic, practical, and time-saving conveniences, so that ordinary tenants can live in peace and contentment and will not feel the pain of every inch of land being worth its weight in gold. According to Mr. Kong and others, when things are gathered together, costs are saved; when things are scattered, costs are increased. For example, in dining, if 10 people go to a restaurant and contribute 20 yuan, they can enjoy a sumptuous banquet. If one person goes and contributes 2 yuan, can they eat bird's nest, shark's fin, and other such delicacies? The same principle applies to the problem of housing. This is truly a famous theory. The first trial location of the company's housing is on Zhejiang Road (between Tianjin Road and Ningbo Road). It is a newly built four-story concrete and steel-frame Western-style building. The completeness and meticulousness of its equipment is unprecedented and will serve as a model for future company houses. The articles of association will soon be published in various newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Preventing Meningitis by Zhu Yang-gao <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Meningitis is now even more rampant, endangering countless lives. The reason for this is the underdevelopment of our country's sanitation facilities. Meningitis is caused by the invasion of the body by the Meningitis bacteria. Patients become a colony for the bacteria, where it develops and reproduces. Although the body's resistance fights against it, it is often unable to win. Patients are full of germs, and all bodily excrement contains them. The most dangerous are saliva and nasal mucus. When speaking or coughing, liquid droplets containing germs are often sprayed on others. Therefore, about 30% of the people around the patient contain these germs. These germ carriers (medically called post-germ carriers) may or may not get sick, depending on the thickness of their resistance. If they are lucky enough not to get sick, and still work in society and come into contact with others, they can transmit the germs in their mouths to others. This third person who gets the germs often gets sick, and the rate of illness is higher than that of the second person who directly receives the germs from the patient, because the germs can always increase their toxicity in the body of the second person. In summary, these germ-carrying people who are not sick are the most important spreaders of Meningitis, and are also the most dangerous to society, because one person can cause thousands of people to get the germs and get sick. Therefore, if we want to eradicate Meningitis, we must first teach these people not to allow others to come into contact with them, and to suspend their duties until the germs are checked twice and not found, and then they can resume their duties as usual. The person himself should be disinfected under the guidance of a doctor. After about three weeks, all the germs can be eliminated. Although there may be some losses in business, the benefits to society are not small. The second most important thing to prevent this disease is to isolate the sick in one place, or in a hospital, so that they cannot create germ carriers. Also, the patient's belongings, clothing, etc., must be disinfected at any time. After recovery (or death), the ward must also be completely disinfected to prevent endangering society. For example, when doing laundry, do not directly hand the patient's clothes to the laundry worker. It must first be soaked in a stinky water solution for about 2 hours before handing it over.</p>
<p>Attached Disinfection Method</p>
<p>Disinfection of mouth, nose, and hands: Wash with one tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide added to one cup of warm water. Wash hands with 3% Lysol soap and water.</p>
<p>Disinfection of clothing, etc.: Immerse in 5% carbolic acid solution for at least 2 hours.</p>
<p>Disinfection of woolen clothing: Because it cannot be immersed in water, spray it with 3% Lysol solution and sprinkle it in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Disinfection of cheap toys, paper goods, etc.: Burn them.</p>
<p>Disinfection of wards: Repaint the walls with lime water. Wash floors and wooden objects with hot lye water and soap, or wash with 5% carbolic acid solution.</p>

The temporary filming location was the German Zeppelin airfield, where a river channel more than 2,000 feet wide was excavated. Movie stars from Germany, Russia, England, and France were carefully selected to play the leading and supporting roles in the film. It is a masterpiece of the great Russian director Toronski.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Grand Plan for Direct Canal between Central Europe <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>▲ From the North Sea to the Black Sea</p>
<p>▲ Construction is Progressing Rapidly</p>
<p>Vienna News: A very large excavation project is currently underway here. The content of this project is to open a waterway across Europe, from the North Sea to the Black Sea, passing through the Rhine, Main, and Danube rivers. The direct shipping route from the Rhine to the Danube was opened in 1864, but because the riverbed is not deep, only ships of 120 tons can travel. In 1901, the Rhine-Main-Danube Joint Company was organized to plan a canal between the North Sea and the Black Sea, so that large ships could travel. The company first opened a 70-mile-long river channel on the upper reaches of the Danube River from Passau. In 1926, the dredging work of the Main River began in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, Germany. It has now been opened to Miltenberg and is expected to be opened to Wurzburg by 1937. On the other hand, the Danube River work from Passau to the Black Sea is also progressing slowly. In the future, after the completion of this grand canal, transportation in Central Europe will be greatly facilitated. Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria all hope to use this waterway to transport agricultural products at low cost and import industrial products. After the completion of the canal, it is estimated that it can generate 168,202 kilowatts of hydroelectric power per year, as a by-product, for industrial use. After the opening of the Elbe-Oder-Danube canal, which is under discussion, Czechoslovakia and Poland can be connected with the Balkan Peninsula and Southern Russia. The Danube River will occupy an increasingly important position.</p>
