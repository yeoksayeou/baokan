<p>實則此非根本之論也世界工商業國之必日衰敗爲勢所必至之事我前已屢言之雖中國因内戰之故又因金貴銀賤之故驟然與世界商業一打擊然即無此二者世界工商業之如是競爭貨物必日趨於供過於求之地位而日漸衰敗其勢亦决不能免其所異者不過一則驟而稍速一則漸而稍緩耳故英國今日救濟商業之策即使有效亦不過暫時之稍稍恢復於根本之救濟决無效騐也</p>

<p>國民社二十四日耶路撒冷電國際聯盟所派調查泣牆問題委員會業已竣事阿剌伯人領袖仍堅持讓步範圍祇可允猶太人往泣牆參觀不能祈禱態絶堅决其理由以一旦允其祈禱後猶太人將更進要求泣牆上之歐墨爾禮拜寺也現委員會囑雙言試行談判若至九月仍不能覔得一彼此同意之基礎則委員會將以若干建議遞送國聯委託統治委員會</p>
<p>按泣牆爭端發生於去年八月間迄今猶未解决現已成世界宗敎大問題查此問題之起原由於回敎徒與猶太敎徒均認泣牆爲聖蹟考此牆原爲猶太王蘇羅門廟西隅之牆廟於西曆七十年爲羅馬人所毁今僅存此數十丈斷垣而已猶太敎徒視此爲猶太民族古代光榮之遺跡且目爲宗敎上最聖潔</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>之祭壇而回敎徒亦認此爲聖跡蓋穆罕默德當日在耶路撒冷赴回敎堂祈禱時曾繫馬於此且以此牆今緊連歐墨爾回敎堂也泣牆所占之地基與其前之狹道均屬回敎徒所有自第四世紀中葉以來全世界之猶太人紛至泣牆前禮拜並吻牆石以悼耶路撒冷之毁滅及猶太民族之流離泣牆主人素無問言但至一九二八年爭端倐起緣猶太人欲於泣牆前設一巨幕以分隔男女之膜拜者而回敎徒反對之以爲違反歷來習慣因此釀成流血慘劇先後殺死二百七十人又傷五百人回敎徒遂有不許猶太人進臨該牆之主張蓋視此純爲法律問題而非法治問題也猶太人之意見以爲彼等并不目此爲政治問題而爲純粹之宗敎問題彼等所要求者乃禮拜自由爲國聯委託管理條件所規定者猶太人參拜此泣牆至少有一千七百年之久回敎徒不應藉端禁阻國聯回雙方相持不下曾特派委員團至耶路撒冷實地調查以便覔一解决方法觀上電所云雙方意見猶未能接近也</p>

<h3>敎部編審圖書經過（續）</h3>
<p>一選材原則選材以一民主義爲基礎凡關於自然衛生史地國民道德各項材料均以總理遺著爲根據遇必要時再從敎育部審定的各種小學敎科書及民衆讀本中抽取最必要的常識爲之補充但仍以不背本黨主義爲原則二材料來材料來原分爲四種第一是總理遺著（特别注重三民主義）這是主要的材料來原第二是各種民衆讀本第三是各種審定之小學敎科書第四是敎育部頒布之小學課程暫行標準三選材標準選材標準有四（一）須爲瞭解並認議黨義所不可少的常識（二）須爲民衆所需要（三）須能改進民衆生活（四）須能介紹必要的生字四選材的手續先由選材委員會議决分工辦法指定搜集材料的人員第二步手續由各人就上列四種材料來源選出有闢於所担任的科目的材料盡數列成一表以不遺漏爲目的第三步手續由各人根據選材標準用常識判斷把表上所列的材料决定比較重要的程度并選出最有價值的材料（自二十五項至五十項各科不同）第四步手續由各人把選出的材料寫在卡片上說明材料的來源及其包括的要點以供編輯時參考之用最後召集選材委員會議先由各人報告搜集及選擇之經過情形再把各項選出的材料作詳細的討論如以最終的决定（三）編輯課文材料選定了以後我們即進行編輯的工作因爲三民主義千字課分兒童用及成年用兩種所以編輯應分兒童組成年組兩組每組設編輯人員三人一人擔任課文設計插圖造意及編輯敎授書一人擔任課文起草還有一人擔任修正文字及總整理在編輯之前我們先議定幾個編輯原則（一）第一個原則就是把課文的意義弄得異常明顯使得民衆識了字便能彀慣得意義因爲如果能彀做到這個地步不但敎師可以敎得好就是没有敎師敎民衆也可以靠着注童符號的帮助自己來自修眞是要推行全民識字運動我們認爲一定要依這個原則來編輯千字課本才行（二）這次課文裏的材料因爲是太充實太高深所以要完全依據上述原則來編輯在事實上萬難做到於是不得已而求其次我們對黨義及史地方面較深的材料祗求把因難之點集中於一點或兩點使敎師能在二十分鐘以内講得清楚這是我們的第二原則（三）對於黨義方面的材料我們須字斟句酌設法避免各種的誤解這是我們的第三原則（四）文字要多變化且須在可能範圍内供給學習的動機這是我們的第四原則</p>
<p>現在這兩種千字課都編成了四册每册二十二課關於編輯三民主義千字課的經過情形大略報告過了現在還有幾點要加以說明（一）這次三民主義千字課的編輯完全是以中央訓練部所列之編輯三民主義千字課要點爲根據的編輯的主要方針乃在普及三民主義我們大家曉得中國文字非常複雜要使得民衆識字是一件很困難的事情我們大家又曉得三民主義的理論是很高深的要使之普及於民衆也是困難異常現在我們要把兩件極困難的事情合起來做固然這件工作是很重要而且極有興味但是究竟是一種空前的創舉至少帶着一點冒險性和試騐性我們要做到怎麽様的完善確是没有多大的把握（二）這次三民主義千字課的編輯限期在六月底以前完結中間還經過很繁的計字工作實際上編輯課文的時間還不到二個月的工夫這様重要而困難的工作在這様短的時間内完成我們自已覺得是太大膽了所以這次編成的三民主義千字課僅作爲暫行本以供試騐研究之用經一年試騐研究之後我們還要加以澈底的修正（三）這次選字因爲材料太少所以結果還不十分可靠我們還須把材料擴到一百五十萬字再加精密的統計完成一部極有價值的民衆字彙這次選字的結果也不過暫時採用而已總之三民主義千字課的編輯到現在只可以說是作一小小的結朿我們還須繼續加以研究繼續加以改良在今後的一年當中敎育部編審處除了繼續審查敎科書并精極進行翻譯科學名詞以外就把三民主義千字課的修正作爲一項主要的工作我們希望在明年十二月底以前能够完成一部有價值的民衆字典和一部完善的基本識字課本供作推行全民識字的工具（完）</p>

<h3>台維斯杯得主美國？法國？</h3>
<p>電訉傳來美國捷音克服歐洲帶覇者意大利奪得一九三○年台杯却倫治賽權行將於七月與五六七三日在巴黎之羅蘭格洛大球場果連執世界錦標三載之法蘭西一决雌雄其結果如何固難預測然早爲環球網球愛好家所齊注視自自疑義</p>
<p>晚近斯界專家酷評法國之勝運垂將殆滅良以風騷絶世之四騎士僅得柯顯脫及波羅脫拉依然　在白羅尼安則年事已高而拉柯斯德踐其誓約不復援助其　友彼之隱退實與法國以莫大摇動且今年惠勃爾登大會法國明星一敗塗地其精神上影響於實力者殊非淺鮮是以一九三○年台維斯杯覇權一般人士莫不替法國危欋焉</p>
<p>反觀美國雖有鐵爾登及亨達之隱退今年之出陣者均爲青壯新進能手六月以來轉戰英法成績卓絶大有先聲壓敵之氣慨愛力遜文賴因之雙打敢决定其能操勝劵惟單打則未無不安難怪乎當局洞察此弱點急電懇老將鐵爾登之効力也</p>
<p>網球大王柯顯脫難於全英大會傷其名聲但未敢斷言其於却倫治賽復遭覆轍之屏波羅脫拉雖受挫於鐵爾登惟其剛勇健鬥當爲法國奪得單打一分是則結果將視愛力遜之單打成續如何有以定奪台杯之誰屬也抑吾人興味之所注厥爲勝敗之如何當明示美國式網球衛及披靡世界近代的法國網球術之分岐點願讀者刮目視之</p>

<h3>遠東會菲日拳鬭糾紛餘聞（衍華）</h3>
<p>據菲列濱日報載有菲島國立大學體育指導蒂洛兒一文辯明第九屆遠運會拳鬭公開錦標决賽菲列濱棄權之理由蓋蒂氏當時身任敎練之職彼先謂其隊員雖因不公平之比賽秩序及偏袒之裁判於喪心失望中仍勉力奮戰態度至堪嘉許隨後詳列個中不愉快之情由各節均經本報摘要專電見諸遠運會特刋上兹不復贅</p>
<p>蒂氏文中最可注意者厥爲其豪膽直言不諱彼謂當時菲島總敎練伊浪南博士雖極力反對棄權然此舉實基因於日本拳鬭委員之大錯妄行蔑人故不得不採取最後手段有以警戒其將來一切責任彼固甘受惟是非曲直則願公衆達眼審之</p>
<p>蒂氏結末喚醒其國人之注意詳述如欲於一九三四年奪取錦標則各項運動亦須要最善之訓練準備莫遺餘力則以拳鬭而言日本絶不落後斯技之隆盛日興每月均有業餘拳鬭賽之舉行努力推進而菲島僅得二月舉行之全國大會實有天壞之别上屆遠運會菲選手之將略策戰雖較勝一籌從今四年後日本定能趕上更有驚人之進步云</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>民族論朱劍白</h3>
<p>BernardJoseph原著</p>
<p>民智書局出版</p>
<p>本書的譯者劉君木自己說「近年引伸孫中山先生民權民生之說作爲專書或迻譯國外論民主政治與社會政策名名著以與孫先生學說相參較者爲數尙不少至於摽討民族性質和問題的著作則幾不可見譯者之所以介紹瑟博士大著就是想彌輔國内出牌界這重罅隙」固然這本關於民族的專著有值得我們一讀的價值</p>
<p>本書先從民族的主要因素丨丨語言宗敎國土傳說文學和共同生活的意志研究起次進而研究民俗的歷史的起源和散在全世界的民族最後重作民族意義的討論說明他對國家愛國主義國際主義和戰爭關係</p>
<p>現在先把作者對民族文學民族意識和民族與戰爭所持的見解作一簡單的介紹</p>
<p>「民族的文學雖不常爲民族構成的因但極能搏合民族各分子激發其民族思想牠加緊民族的情緒注入民族各分子以民族的熱誠牠不斷地燃燒着民族的精神使他們盡心竭力的擁護其民族無論民族的情感是以甚麽因素爲根據即使消沉了牠也能使牠激揚奮發」我們於此深切地認識民族的文學與民族前途的關係我們更看到波希米亞和塞爾維亞民族的復興都得力於民族的文學不少因此最近中國有民族主義文藝運動者正在努力建樹民族主義的文藝實在切應中國現代的需要荷有激發民族思相加緊民族情緒燃燒民族精神中興中國民族的重大使命</p>
<p>作者不高談世界文化而極力主張民族的文化這是很值得我們佩服的一點他說「由此可知文化之不能不帶民族的臭味世界太廣漠了故世界的文化還談不到因此文明之進殊只藉民族文化的發展之助每一民族的文化因爲民族的環境和性質之殊異可望産生一種特殊的屬性以貢獻於共同的世界文明」這和孫中山先生的話不謀而合孫先生告訴我們「我們要知道世界主義是從甚麽地方發生出來的呢是從民族主義發生出來的我們要發達世界主義先要民族主　義鞏固才行如果民族主義不能鞏固世界主義就不能發逹由此便可知世界義實藏在民族主義之内」這裏我們可以認識我們努力的途徑</p>
<p>關於民族意識的重要本書的作者說「在民族的意識命令之下民族的分子還須常把他們所具的民族情緒具體表現出來因爲這個緣故民族意識又可視爲民族發展與團結的具體因素」同時我們看到意大利的民族主義者極力欲喚醒意大利青年的民族意識凡加入他們的民族主義組織少年意大利黨者使之宣誓這可見意大利人的注意喚醒民族意識並給我們以很好的敎訓</p>
<p>作者於東方的民族集團一章内說「埃及人還不能以有文學或有文化自誇近年來他們在這方面的唯一貢獻只是報紙上和小册子上的宣傳性質的民族主義論文他們對於民族的根本没有充分的了解誤把政治上的自决權側重太過太不注意到養成和訓練羣衆的民族意識和創建民族的文學文化和生活方式」的確養成和訓練羣衆的民族意識和創建民族的文學文化和生活方式是民族唯一的出路我們看到現在中國有民族主義文藝運動者正在努力這一步工作了是值得我們注意的</p>
<p>作者於東方的民族集團一章内論到中國他說「他們不能獲到者就是民族意識的發展宗法制度的擁護使中國人不能有民族的情緒必須有這個情緒然後他們才覺得自己都是一個團體的一部分所以中國人雖具有許多民族的物質要素但因爲心理上和精神上一致的缺乏仍不能稱爲眞正的民族」我們中國人正因爲心理上和精神上一致的缺乏所以孫中山先生說中國人是一盤散沙似的民族我們不應不滿意於作者不能稱中國人爲眞正民族的話而應該把作者警惕我們的話作爲我們努力的標準以發展民族的意識</p>
<p>作者於民族主義愛國主義與戰爭一章有值得我們特别注意的所在作者說「愛國心和爭民族光榮之念固常被人目爲戰爭的導火缐即民族觀念本身亦惹起人們這樣子的譏評有人說民族情緒之覺醒實爲十九世紀戰爭頻繁的原因」而作者的見解則認民族觀念與爭没有直接的關係他否認十九世紀的戰爭由於民族的覺醒之說「其實只是民族的發展爲當時的戰爭所推動而不是戰爭爲民族觀念所激起」換句話說一過去的衝突紛爭不是民族主義之過而是不奉行民族主義之過故民族主義的引伸便足以建立民族間相當的平等因而將消滅了最易惹起戰爭的原因了」這裏我們看到作者絶不主張狹隘的民族主義而主張建立民族間的平等以消滅惹起戰爭的原因和我們的民族主　義最後目的在求世界民族一律平等並無不合不過這裏要替作者補充幾句話我們深信在世界民族尙未達到完全平等以前各民族顯分着壓迫的和被壓迫的兩個階級强大民族的侵略壓迫弱小民族是必然的形勢弱小民族的起而謀自衛圖自决也是必然的形勢我們固然不主張以戰爭爲解决民族問題的唯一方法可是「人爲刀俎我爲魚肉」臨到民族生死存亡的關頭我們除掉戰爭的最後手段還有其他求生的路麽我們果然不是盲目的一味主張戰爭可是民族自衛的戰爭民族求生存的戰爭在受壓迫的民族不應該忘掉的近來什麽軍縮會議非戰公約這都是帝國主義玩弄其他民族的鬼把戲可憐受壓迫的我們根本無軍可縮無戰可非所以我們要認識民族戰爭雖然是犧牲很大但這是民族求生存求自由平等的應付的代價這點見解本書的作者雖同様的抱持着可是文字没有說得十分明白</p>
<p>本書作者之論述東方民族運動不免有些隔膜同時對於國際聯盟未免信任過深可是全書大體很可供我們研究民族問題與民族主義的參考這裏恕不列舉式的介紹了</p>

<h3>National Government Telegram of Condolence to Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>Nanjing National Government, 25th telegram to Chiang Yunxing's headquarters, General Commander Chiang: Your Excellency, I am pleased to hear that a group of villains has rebelled. The nation has no choice but to use military force. Our army, relying on the majestic spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the leadership of the Grand Marshal, is loyal to the Three Principles of the People and strives forward without fear. Thus, we have been able to achieve great success together and repeatedly urge the strong enemy. The news of victory is widely spread, and I am extremely pleased. The meritorious generals in this campaign, including Wang Jun, Wang Jinyu, Xu Yuanquan, Yang Hucheng, Gu Zhutong, Chiang Ting-wen, Shangguan Yunxiang, Hao Mengling, Xiao Zhichu, and Yang Shengzhi, etc., have been promoted by me and should be approved and filed immediately. The officers and soldiers who contributed to the effort, whether they fought bravely and achieved meritorious service, or were wounded in fierce battles, or sacrificed their lives to defeat the enemy, should be rewarded and compensated separately. I also hope that you will instruct them to investigate, verify and report. Now that the bandit atmosphere has weakened and the chief villains are about to be punished, I only hope that you will continue to drive forward, capture the ringleaders, sweep away their lairs, and eliminate the obstacles to political tutelage and national construction to consolidate the foundation of a unified and peaceful country. The government has high hopes. (Seal of the National Government) (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Central Army Prepares to Attack Xinzheng</h3>
<p>Pursuit Team Reaches the Vicinity of Wunüdian</p>
<p>Feng's Army Counterattacks Twice Without Success</p>
<p>Nanjing Fiftieth Division Staff Office, 25th telegram: The enemy in the capital has suffered repeated defeats in counterattacks, their morale is low, and they are unable to fight again. They are collapsing and retreating northward. The Central Army is currently preparing to attack Xinzheng, and fierce battles are expected soon. Our division has already crossed Yancheng. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing Military News: The enemy on the Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railway line has lost its combat capability after being severely attacked by our army. Although they attempted to counterattack, they ultimately failed. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the enemy was unable to resist, retreating step by step towards Xuchang and Zhengzhou. Currently, our army has reached the vicinity of Xuchang, and the enemy appears to be abandoning Xuchang and fleeing north. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing Military News: At midnight on the 23rd, the enemy troops in Xuchang launched two counterattacks on the Dashiqiao position, but they were both repulsed by the National Army. We are now taking advantage of the momentum to pursue. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Luohe, 25th telegram: Fan Zhongxiu's troops, Jiao Wendian, etc., have now revolted in the Zheng (zhou)-Ji (xian) area, digging up the enemy's railways and electric wires, and launching fierce attacks on the rear of Feng's army. Zhang Weixi, Liu Yufen, and other troops collapsed and retreated towards Weishi, Changge, and Gonglu on the night of the 20th and the morning of the 21st. Currently, our army is dividing its forces to pursue them. Feng's troops on the Pinghan Railway line have been completely cleared. Zhengzhou will be captured soon. When the enemy troops retreated, their supplies and baggage were completely intercepted by Jiao. Jiao has sent personnel to Luohe to negotiate surrender and acceptance into the National Revolutionary Army. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing Ninth Army Staff Office, 25th telegram: The enemy in the capital is terrified by our army's repeated capture of key locations. They are currently holding their positions in the Hediling area. Once the order for a general attack is issued, we will annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Nanjing Military News: Zhang Weixi and other troops on the Pinghan Railway suddenly retreated completely on the evening of the 21st. The 48th, 44th, and 17th Divisions of the National Army took advantage of the momentum to pursue. The 48th Division occupied Linying on the morning of the 22nd, and the 17th Division occupied Yingyang. That evening, our pursuit force reached the vicinity of Wunüdian near Xuchang and engaged in battle with the enemy's rearguard, seizing hundreds of enemy weapons and capturing more than 700 people. They are currently pursuing fiercely northward. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Central Aircraft Drop Bombs in Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Journalist Delegation Returns to Beiping</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang Works in an Underground Bunker</p>
<p>Zhengzhou: While the Chinese and foreign journalist delegation was inspecting the front line, the Central Air Force began attacking the Longhai Railway line, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou. It had been three weeks since the last attack. At 8:00 AM on the 22nd, the journalist delegation was scheduled to go to the Longhai front line for inspection. Whether the Central Army found out about this is unknown. Six Central single-wing and biplane aircraft appeared over Zhengzhou at 7:20 AM, dropping more than 30 bombs centered on the railway station headquarters. The citizens of Zhengzhou fled in panic, either to underground air raid shelters or outside the city, immediately plunging the city into a state of extreme chaos. The journalist delegation's departure was delayed until 8:00 PM. Feng's army had only one anti-aircraft gun. The others used ordinary field guns to bombard the sky. The shells grazed the roofs of civilian houses and flew upwards, merely causing white flames to shoot into the sky like fireworks, without exerting any defensive power against the aircraft. Only one shell exploded on the wing of one aircraft, but the aircraft continued to circle in the air, randomly firing machine guns before leisurely leaving. The other five aircraft also unleashed their power over Zhengzhou, threatening the city to the fullest extent. After about 30 minutes, they headed south. On the morning of the 23rd, a thin mist arose. After 6:00 PM, three more Southern Army aircraft flew over, displaying even greater power than the previous day, either dropping bombs or randomly firing machine guns, causing great fear to the citizens. Several bombs fell on two hotels in front of the station, killing and wounding more than ten people. The aircraft were all flying at low altitude, so the scene of the aircraft dropping bombs could be seen with the naked eye, and the direction of the bombs falling could also be distinguished. The citizens, in a state of extreme tension, avoided the direction of the falling bombs and fled. The air force displayed its brutal power for about 45 minutes before leisurely leaving. On the 24th, aircraft also came to attack, causing the citizens to tremble with fear and suffer endless intimidation. Although the Northwest Army has several aircraft, there is only one pilot who can fly them. From this, it can be seen that the Southern weapons are far superior to those of the North. (Telecommunications Agency telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Chinese and foreign journalist delegation that went to the Henan front line returned to Beiping at 5:00 AM on the 25th. (Telecommunications Agency telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The journalist delegation visiting Zhengzhou inspected Feng's underground office bunker, which was divided into six rooms that could accommodate dozens of people. Large carbide lamps were hung inside, making it as bright as day and very cool. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Beiping Expansion Committee Exchanges Views on Party and Government Matters</h3>
<p>Publishes Seven Basic Conditions</p>
<p>Wang to Go to Cangzhou and Zhengzhou to Meet Yan and Feng</p>
<p>Beiping, this morning at 10:00 AM, members of the Expansion Committee Zhao Pilian, Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, Fu Rulin, etc., exchanged views on party affairs with Wang Jingwei. Zou Lu, Xie Chi, and Zhang Zhiben all presented their theories. A general consensus can be reached in theory. After one or two more talks, a formal meeting notice can be issued. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Expansion Committee announced seven basic conditions as a result of the talks: (1) Preparations for a National Assembly, with various professional groups as constituent members. (2) Based on the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, create a fundamental law, the name of which, whether Provisional Constitution or Constitution, will be determined later, establishing the organization of government organs and the protection of the public and private rights of the people. This fundamental law should be decided by the National Assembly, but in urgent circumstances, it may be announced by the Expansion Committee and ratified by the National Assembly in the future. (3) The people's movement should start from local self-government according to the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, strictly preventing the Communist Party from inciting the disaster of class struggle. (4) Party departments at all levels should stand in a guiding and supervisory position over the government and politics, without directly interfering in administrative affairs. (5) Party departments should not replace public opinion organs. (6) Premier Sun Yat-sen's governance of the country through the Party is governance through Party ideology, which should concentrate talents and gather the strength of the masses. (7) Central and local organs should adopt a system of balanced power according to the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, without leaning towards either centralism or localism. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Wang Jingwei spoke to Zhang Jiluan last night: (1) The National Assembly should be convened as soon as possible, and its representatives should be allowed to be freely elected by the people. (2) The people's movement should aim to assist local self-government and should not be a struggle-style movement of the past. (3) Wang believes that the freedom of political association should be allowed, and the existence of other political parties can be recognized, except for groups that aim to subvert the social foundation and destroy the national system. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Beiping Travel Agency News: Wang Jingwei will go to Cangzhou within the next few days to meet with Yan Xishan, and then transfer from the Cang(zhou)-Shi(jiazhuang) highway to Shijiazhuang to meet with Feng Yuxiang. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>
<p>Beiping: Wang Jingwei will soon go to Shijiazhuang or Zhangde to meet with Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. Before the meeting, a formal enlarged meeting will be held to decide on the general principles for organizing the government. He has also recently sent a representative to meet with Zhang Xueliang, carrying a draft plan for organizing the government, and will go back and forth to Zhang to make a decision. Before there is any prospect of success, he will temporarily take a cautious attitude. Therefore, the concrete establishment of a Northern government must be realized after Wang, Yan, and Feng meet in Shijiazhuang and the representative to Feng returns. Its time is approximately at the beginning of the middle of August. (Telecommunications Agency telegram of the 25th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Britain's Commercial Relief</h3>
<p>Britain is anxious to relieve its declining commerce, and has dispatched a Far East commercial survey team to seek the re-activation of British commerce. The House of Commons also discussed industry and commerce, focusing on the steel and cotton industries. The decline of the cotton industry is attributed to the two markets of India and China. From this, it can be seen that the impact of commercial decline has also affected Britain, and it is seeking remedies. The method of remedy is focused on the Far East. In the minds of ordinary people, China still has a great relationship with world commerce.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not a fundamental argument. The inevitable decline of the world's industrial and commercial countries is an inevitable trend. We have repeatedly said this before. Although China has suffered a sudden blow to world commerce due to the civil war and the high price of gold and the low price of silver, even without these two factors, such competition in world industry and commerce will inevitably lead to a position where goods will tend to be oversupplied and will gradually decline. Its momentum will never be avoided. The only difference is that one is sudden and slightly faster, and the other is gradual and slightly slower. Therefore, even if Britain's current policy of relieving commerce is effective, it will only be a temporary slight recovery and will never be effective in fundamental relief.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>Beiping: This morning at 9:00 AM, Wang Jingwei met with Chinese journalists at the travel agency. He was first received by his secretary Zeng Zhongming, and then Wang came out to meet them. He was wearing a silk suit and looked like he was in his thirties, but he was actually forty-seven years old. He was slightly thinner than before. The journalists asked simple questions and answers: (1) He said that the Enlarged Conference could be formally established at the beginning of next month, and its main tasks were to convene the Third National Congress of the Kuomintang and the National Assembly. The Enlarged Conference should also have its own organization, which is currently being drafted. (2) In the future, political tutelage must emphasize democracy. (3) Some people in the South are worried that the National Assembly will shake the Party's policies. He said that if the Three Principles of the People are properly publicized, the National Assembly will definitely accept them. (4) He believes that a law guaranteeing human rights must be produced, that is, a constitution, which must be produced by the National Assembly. Recently, it may be possible to draft a temporary provisional constitution first. (5) There is a lack of unity in the theories of the superior Party departments, which should be actively reorganized in the future. (6) He will go to the front to consult with Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. (7) All parties are recommending Yan Xishan as chairman of the National Government, and he thinks Yan may not be able to refuse.</p>

<h3>Progress of the Korean Army's Defense Line on the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Nanjing Military News: Li Fuying's Jin Army has been directing the Zhongshan armored train to attack our Korean troops in Zhoucun and Zhangdian for several days.

After our Jin Handing Division occupies Zhecheng, it will join forces with Xu's Division, which invaded Linying from the Pinghan Line, to attack Taikang from both sides. Sun Dianying knows that Taikang has no natural defenses and is afraid of being surrounded, so he still intends to retreat north. (Special telegram of the 25th)</p>

<h3>Plan to Expand the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the plan to expand the national shipping industry, the Ministry of Communications believes that building merchant ships requires a larger shipyard.

Therefore, the first step in the plan is to establish a large-scale shipyard. However, due to economic relations, it has not been able to actively proceed, but it is already in preparation.

According to Ministry of Communications officials, the former General Directorate of Posts had a Director and a Commissioner. The Director was Chinese, and the Commissioner was a foreigner. All the real power in the Directorate was in the hands of the Commissioner. The Commissioner sometimes did not have to report to the Ministry for personnel and administrative matters. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Communications, in order to recover postal rights, formulated the Regulations of the General Directorate of Posts, changing the Director to Commissioner, with a Chinese person filling the position, and changing the Commissioner to Associate Commissioner, with a foreigner filling the position. All matters had to be signed by the Commissioner before they could take effect. As a result, the number of foreign staff in the Directorate gradually decreased. However, the Legislative Yuan had not yet been established when the Regulations of the General Directorate of Posts were formulated, so the regulations were only filed with the National Government. This year, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau was established, and its regulations were also promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, the original Regulations of the General Directorate of Posts were not changed, but the General Directorate of Posts was changed to the General Directorate of Postal Affairs to indicate that the Directorate was of a business nature, while the administrative power was in the hands of the Ministry of Communications.

<p>Italy Suffers Multiple Calamities: Earthquake in the South, Wind Disaster in the North</p>
<p>Venetia Ravaged by Violent Winds</p>
<p>Mount Vesuvius Erupts Again</p>
<p>Seven Districts Affected by Earthquake</p>
<p>Rescue Teams Rush to Bury the Dead</p>
<p>Schools Converted into Temporary Hospitals</p>
<p>Italian King Visits Disaster Area in Person</p>
<p>Prime Minister Forbids Private Fundraising</p>
<p>Reuters, Treviso, 25th: Italy's southern region has been hit by an earthquake, and now its northern region has been struck by a wind disaster. Venetia has been ravaged by violent winds, affecting an area 25 miles long. It is estimated that 20 people have died, and the army has been ordered to take charge of disaster relief work. A follow-up dispatch reports that 27 people have died in the wind disaster, hundreds have been injured, and many houses have collapsed, causing significant damage to nearby villages. Relief efforts are difficult due to transportation disruptions.</p>
<p>Reuters, Naples, 24th: Mount Vesuvius has erupted again, causing concern. People are watching Mount Vesuvius across the bay, which also shows signs of activity. Thousands of residents are sleeping outdoors. A strong wind suddenly arose this morning, and huge waves crashed against the shore, causing even greater panic among the people. The earthquake damage may be more severe than currently known, as reports from remote villages have not yet arrived. The Italian Prime Minister has arranged relief efforts and dispatched several airplanes loaded with food to transport it to disaster areas with disrupted transportation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 24th: Today's official gazette states that seven districts have been affected by the earthquake. The disaster is most severe in the town of Ariano Irpino, where 1,392 people have died and 2,072 have been injured. There have also been many deaths and injuries elsewhere. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has forbidden public and private donations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 24th: Reports are pouring in, and the number of dead and injured continues to rise. Southern Italy, formerly a beautiful and fertile region, has been transformed into a desolate and ruined area. Since the earthquake on Wednesday morning, the main roads have cracked and transportation has been disrupted, making it impossible to assess the true extent of the disaster for the time being, and relief efforts are also very difficult to organize. The most severely affected areas are Ofena and Villa Nova, where few houses are still standing. Almost every family has been affected. The Italian King will visit the disaster area in person tonight. The American Red Cross has volunteered to assist with relief efforts. The Italian government is doing its best to distribute food and other necessities in the disaster area. Airplanes are dropping food packages to the victims, and trucks are rushing to disaster areas where roads are still passable to unload food and medicine and carry back homeless refugees. The Vice Minister of Public Works is currently overseeing relief efforts in the disaster area. A train from Melfi carried 200 corpses. Melfi is a famous historical city with 13,000 residents, located on the slopes of Monte Vulture, 2,000 feet above sea level. The disaster in the town of Naples is relatively light, with only 13 deaths reported. A troop of reformed soldiers stationed in Melfi has been very helpful in rescuing the injured after the earthquake. The commander has requested clemency for the past misdeeds of the troop.</p>
<p>Reuters, Villa Nova, 25th: 250 corpses have been excavated from the rubble here, and the number of injured exceeds 500. A Reuters reporter traveled 350 miles in the disaster area and witnessed entire villages and towns destroyed or partially destroyed. But the most tragic scene was seen in Villa Nova. Only ruins and broken walls remain of shops, palaces, and churches. Almost no building in the town has been preserved. The surviving residents are now living in the fields, and rations are being distributed by the authorities. Soldiers are guarding the town and not allowing anyone to enter. The same defense is in place in other disaster towns.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 24th: Southern Italy has just suffered a devastating earthquake, and today Northern Italy has been hit by an extremely violent hurricane, especially between Venice and Milan, where the disaster is most severe. Thousands of trees have been uprooted, countless houses have collapsed, and many people have been seriously injured. It is still difficult to estimate the losses.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 24th: Transportation to the earthquake-stricken towns and villages in Italy is gradually being restored. At present, several towns, such as Sarno, which originally had 20,000 people, Avellino, which originally had 19,000 people, and the smaller towns of San Severino, San Chirico Raparo, and Schirano, are still without news due to complete transportation disruptions. According to aerial photographs, the entire area is in chaos, and it is feared that there are more deaths. Rescue teams composed of soldiers and civilians are working day and night to bury the dead to prevent epidemics. Local cemeteries are insufficient for burial, so the government has specially dispatched trains to transport the bodies to newly established central cemeteries in southern Italy. As for the survivors, food and shelter are being provided, and the injured are being transported to temporary hospitals where doctors and nurses are providing care day and night. All the small schools in the city of Naples have been converted into temporary hospitals. Many of the collapsed buildings were churches, some of which were hundreds of years old and had survived previous earthquakes, demonstrating the intensity of this earthquake. It is reported that in the town of Villa Nova alone, only two houses remain, and 400 corpses have been recovered. 300 corpses each have been recovered from the towns of Fascodumia and Aquilonia. Many of the areas affected by the disaster are inhabited by immigrants. In recent days, government officials have received a flurry of telegrams from North and South America inquiring about the safety of relatives and friends, but all inquiries must wait until a complete list is compiled several weeks later. The Italian King will visit the disaster area today to offer condolences. The Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has forbidden private fundraising, believing that it is the responsibility of the Fascist Party to provide relief to compatriots and should be borne by the Fascist Party. Guomin News Agency, Washington, 24th: The American Red Cross headquarters today proposed providing assistance to the Italian earthquake victims. According to the Italian Embassy in the United States, although Italy has suffered an earthquake, the public is not in danger of destitution, and the national government is able to cope. There is no need for friendly countries to offer assistance. Some say that the United States provided a great deal of assistance during the Japanese earthquake, and should not sit idly by now. However, another group believes that the disaster in Italy is not as severe as the one in Japan, and the disaster area is only a small part of the country. The remaining provinces and towns that have not been affected by the disaster should have more than enough resources to help themselves, without the need for outsiders to overstep their bounds. Although the Italian Embassy has declined the American Red Cross's kindness, it will still raise funds so that it can provide assistance at any time if needed. The Italian Embassy has expressed its gratitude to the American Red Cross for its good intentions.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Completes Investigation of the Wailing Wall Issue</h3>
<p>Dispute Between Muslims and Jews</p>
<p>Committee Urges Both Sides to Negotiate</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Jerusalem, 24th: The committee dispatched by the League of Nations to investigate the Wailing Wall issue has completed its work. Arab leaders still insist that the scope of concessions can only allow Jews to visit the Wailing Wall, but not to pray, and their attitude is very firm. Their reason is that once they are allowed to pray, the Jews will make further demands on the Mosque of Omar on the Wailing Wall. The committee now urges both sides to try to negotiate. If a mutually agreeable basis cannot be found by September, the committee will submit some recommendations to the League of Nations Mandates Commission.</p>
<p>The Wailing Wall dispute began in August of last year and has not yet been resolved. It has now become a major world religious issue. The origin of this problem is that both Muslims and Jews recognize the Wailing Wall as a sacred site. This wall was originally the western wall of King Solomon's Temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. Only this section of broken wall, several tens of feet long, remains. Jews regard this as a relic of the ancient glory of the Jewish nation and consider it the holiest altar in their religion.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Muslims also recognize this as a sacred site, as Muhammad tied his horse here when he went to the mosque in Jerusalem to pray, and this wall is now directly connected to the Mosque of Omar. The land occupied by the Wailing Wall and the narrow path in front of it belong to Muslims. Since the middle of the fourth century, Jews from all over the world have flocked to the Wailing Wall to worship and kiss the stones of the wall to mourn the destruction of Jerusalem and the diaspora of the Jewish people. The owners of the Wailing Wall have never raised any objections. However, in 1928, a dispute suddenly arose when Jews wanted to erect a large screen in front of the Wailing Wall to separate male and female worshippers, which Muslims opposed, believing it violated long-standing customs. This led to a bloody tragedy, in which 270 people were killed and 500 injured. Muslims then proposed that Jews should not be allowed to approach the wall, viewing this as a purely legal issue and not a religious issue. The Jewish view is that they do not see this as a political issue, but as a purely religious issue. What they are asking for is freedom of worship, as stipulated in the League of Nations mandate. Jews have been worshipping at this Wailing Wall for at least 1,700 years, and Muslims should not take the opportunity to prevent them from doing so. The League of Nations, unable to resolve the stalemate, sent a special delegation to Jerusalem to conduct an on-site investigation in order to find a solution. According to the above dispatch, the opinions of both sides are still far apart.</p>
<h3>Russo-American Commercial Relations</h3>
<p>Amtorg Deemed an Illegal Organization</p>
<p>Communist Documents Discovered to Be Forged</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 24th: According to news from New York, opposition to Amtorg, the Soviet-Russian commercial organization in New York, is growing in the United States, and Russo-American commercial relations may soon be severed. Russian newspapers have published numerous commentaries on this issue. The US House of Representatives, seeing the intense opposition, has formed a special committee to investigate Amtorg's activities. The chairman of the committee, Fish, has deemed Amtorg an illegal organization and demanded the expulsion of all Russian employees, including manager Bogdanov. Although Bogdanov strenuously denied to the committee that Amtorg was a center for communist propaganda, and ultimately stated that if it were closed or its commercial activities were hindered, Russia would take retaliatory action, the committee members remained unmoved.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, New York, 24th: Spalding, a member of the Republican Party and part of the McFadden publishing group, told the Senate committee investigating communist activities today that someone is specializing in forging communist documents and implicating Amtorg, the Soviet-Russian trade organization in the United States, and selling them to news agencies in Washington. Six weeks after the publication of a large number of communist writings by New York Police Commissioner Whalen, these forged documents were discovered. A New York printer has now admitted that he printed the stationery used to write the forged documents. This is consistent with the opinions of various experts investigating the matter. According to experts, the stationery of all the so-called letters between the Soviet-Russian Communist Party and Amtorg was made in the United States and did not come from Soviet-Russia. Furthermore, according to Amtorg officials, the spelling and writing style of the letters are those used by White Russians, which are very different from those currently used by the Soviet-Russian government. This proves that there is undoubtedly an intention to frame them. New York Police Commissioner Whalen has resigned from his position due to this matter and has returned to work at the Wanamaker store, but he has not been able to dispel his doubts about the documents and is continuing to investigate tirelessly in the hope of clearing his name.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Prepares to Withdraw Non-Violent Resistance Order</h3>

<h3>Belgian Territories Demand Right to Self-Determination</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Brussels, 24th: Several newspapers in Brussels have published a letter from the people of Eupen and Malmedy to the Belgian King and people during the Belgian centenary celebration of independence. The letter states that they demand the same rights that the Belgians obtained 100 years ago. Their forced subordination to Belgium violates public opinion and their due rights, so they demand the right to self-determination. If the issue of Eupen and Malmedy is not resolved, it will be a stain on the history of Belgian freedom and will be ridiculed in the 20th century. They believe that the Belgian King and Parliament will be able to handle the matter fairly.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Secretary of the Board of Trade Describes the Situation of the Steel and Cotton Industries</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The House of Commons today discussed industry and commerce, with a focus on the steel and cotton industries. Secretary of the Board of Trade Graham said that the poor situation of the steel industry is not as bad as people say. In terms of various situations, the output numbers for 1913 and 1929 are not very different. The government hopes that the negotiations currently underway between labor and management in the steel industry can reach an agreement. The cotton industry is indeed not as good as before, due to the Indian boycott and difficulties in trade with China and the Far East. Even if the cotton industry recovers somewhat, many cotton mills will not be able to reopen immediately. The report of the Cotton Industry Commission made some suggestions for the coordination of various sectors of the cotton industry. Whether the cotton industry can be reorganized without a compulsory nature is a fundamental issue. The government very much hopes that it can be resolved in this way, otherwise the government will have to consult Parliament. Canada has granted preferential treatment to the United Kingdom, which is a bright spot in the trade situation. He hopes that the business community can gain more excitement at the Imperial Conference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consultation Case on the Naval Treaty</h3>

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: After requesting consultation on the London Treaty, Prime Minister Hamaguchi ordered his secretary, Nakajima Yatatsugu, to deliver it to the secretariat of the Privy Council at 4:15 pm yesterday.

<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 25th: Privy Council President Kuratomi, who was visited by Prime Minister Hamaguchi, told people after the Prime Minister left that the Privy Council does not have a summer vacation system and that it is appropriate to start the review immediately. He has already telegraphed for Niigami Kancho to return to Tokyo from Karuizawa. It is necessary to consult with Vice President Hirao on the review policy and the selection of expert members. At the same time, Niigami Kancho must be ordered to inquire about the contents of the treaty in detail from the government, which will take some time. As in the past, there will be nine expert members, but the exact number has not yet been determined. The review will take at least one month.</p>

<h3>Chen Jitang Departs for Wuzhou</h3>
<p>The Eighth Route Army Recovers Pingle</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatches report that as the military situation in Guangxi province unfolds, the Guangxi army retreats to Guilin, Pingle, and Liuzhou areas. The Eighth Route Army, aware that the enemy is still largely stationed in Guilin, only maintains surveillance over Pingle and Lipu. Its main forces, such as the Li Yangjing division and Huang Renhuan brigade, are deployed in Gongcheng and Shazi Street to control the enemy overlooking from Guilin. Yu Hanmou's division is also garrisoned in Mengshan and Lipu, maintaining vigilance towards Liuzhou. Currently, the various armies are gradually concentrating and are ready to launch an attack on Guilin and Liuzhou at any time. Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, in order to preside over the front-line operations, personally departed for Wuzhou on the 21st of this month. Prior to his departure, the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway prepared a special train carriage, and the Fourth Fleet Command dispatched the Zhixin warship to the Sanshui River mouth to stand by. At around 12:00 PM that afternoon, dozens of military and government officials from the province arrived at Shiwietang to bid farewell. At 1:50 PM, Chen Jitang, accompanied by Lin Yizhong, a member of the provincial government, arrived at the Shiwietang railway station by electric launch. After shaking hands with those who came to see him off, he entered the station waiting room for a brief rest. At 2:30 PM, he stepped onto the platform and boarded the train. With a whistle, the train began its westward journey. Besides his guards, the only people accompanying Chen on this trip were Qu Qipu, Director of the General Political Training Department of the Eighth Route Army, and his deputy, Chen Dacai. The entire staff of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters had gathered at the headquarters at 8:00 AM that morning and departed for Xihaokou at 9:00 AM. By 10:00 AM, all staff members from the staff, military law, logistics, medical, and adjutant departments had boarded the Gao Ya provincial Wuzhou steamboat. The remaining members of the headquarters, including the communications team, hygiene team, nursing team, and wireless team, also boarded the ship in succession. By 11:00 AM, boarding was complete, and the ship began to move at 12:00 PM, led by Tang Haoqing, Director of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters. Before his departure, Chen Jitang told people that his trip to Guangxi was to direct the troops to track and pursue the enemy. The enemy suffered a disastrous defeat in southern Hunan and returned to Guangxi, so our army should take advantage of the situation to pursue them, and it would not be difficult to completely eliminate them with one blow. As for the plan for our army to pursue the enemy, it will be decided after arriving in Wuzhou. The military affairs of Guangdong province will be temporarily handled by Du Yiqian, the Chief of Staff. When the Eighth Route Army Headquarters departed, the Second Air Squadron also dispatched four aircraft to accompany them to Wuzhou. They took off successively at 9:00 AM that morning and arrived in Wuzhou before 12:00 PM. As for Chen Jitang, he transferred to the Zhixin warship at the Sanshui River mouth and sailed upstream along the West River, expected to arrive on the 22nd.</p>
<p>The Eighth Route Army pursuing the enemy into Guangxi has recently advanced fiercely on multiple routes. Recently, the 59th Division, Yu Hanmou's troops, concentrated in Mengjiang and Mengshan, taking into account the defense of the Fu and Da rivers. On the Fu River front, the newly formed army, Shen Rongguang, Zhong Qijie, Lu Dingxiang and other troops, advanced upstream along Zhaoping towards Pingle. On the Da River front, Zhang Jingcheng's regiments guarded Jiangkou in Pingnan. The old 16th Division of Lu Huanyan, now reorganized as the New Second Division with Yang Dingzhong as the division commander, stationed Li Derying's brigade and Pin Chunguan's troops in Yulin, while Gong Shouyi's brigade stationed in Xunzhou. The New First Division of Zhu Weizhen took the road through Sanliwai on the 16th and entered Wuxuan city. The remaining enemy forces in Wuxuan fled towards Xiangxian and Shilong areas upon hearing the news. On the Mengshan front, the 59th Division's training regiment, Peng Linsheng's troops, moved entirely to Lipu on the 18th, cutting off the traffic between Pingle and Liuzhou. Therefore, the newly formed army in Zhaoping was able to go directly to Pingle. At the same time, the Li Yangjing division that arrived in Gongcheng also advanced to Shazi Street to support the Zhaoping armies. On the 18th, Lu Dingxiang's troops in Zhaoping took the lead in advancing to Pingle. The enemy troops in Pingle, Zhou Guozhi's troops, fled upon hearing the news, some fleeing to Guilin. The garrison commander of the Fu River enemy forces, Cen Mengda's troops, also fled in panic. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army took Pingle without a fight. It is reported that after the Eighth Route Army recovered Pingle, it will advance in two routes. Yu Hanmou's troops will attack Liuzhou from Lipu and Xiuren. Li Yangjing's division will advance to Pingle and allocate a portion to Guilin to surround Guilin with the Liu and Li divisions of the Fourth Route Army. The situation in Guinan is also becoming increasingly tense, as the Yunnan army has been advancing towards Yongyuan since passing Taipingfu. The Guinan army of Wei Yunzong stationed in Nanning sent a team to oppose the enemy at Sanjiangkou (about 30 li from Lunan Nanning). Contact occurred there on the 15th. The Guilin army, with a disparity in numbers, has rumors of retreating to Yongyuan. On the 19th, the Yunnan army was approaching Nanning slope. On the 16th and 17th, Li Zongren transferred more than 2,000 Guilin troops from Liuzhou to Yong. It is expected that there will be a major battle near Yongning in the coming days. (July 21)</p>

<h3>The Sun Dianying Troops in Bozhou Are Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Luzhe Can Be Taken Down Soon</p>
<p>A quick dispatch from Xuzhou reports that after Zhang Fang escaped from Bozhou, the central army decided to completely eliminate the Sun Dianying troops within the besieged city to clear the remaining enemies in northern Anhui and eastern Henan and facilitate the advance of front-line military operations. In addition to the original besieging troops, two more divisions of reinforcements were added, launching a fierce attack on the enemy on the morning of the 21st. The enemy's city defense was exhausted and barely resisted until dawn on the 22nd, when they could no longer hold on and broke out of the siege from the west gate of Bozhou, fleeing westward. The central troops intercepted and captured a large number of them. The Seventh Division of Wang Jun's troops entered Bozhou at noon to pacify the people. The city was heavily affected by the siege and suffering imposed by Sun's troops. Wang's troops are searching for the remaining enemies while sending teams to follow and pursue those escaping westward, toward Taikang and Zhecheng areas. However, there are still some remaining troops of Sun's trapped in Luzhe. The central army is pushing forward to continue eliminating them. At the same time, the enemy troops on the front line in eastern Henan are showing signs of wavering across the board, as the defeat of Sun's troops is not enough to contain the strength of the central army. It is expected that with Bozhou lost, Luzhe will also be easily taken down. The situation in the Henan campaign has the potential to be resolved. (July 22)</p>
<h3>Xusu Joint Defense Bandit Suppression Conference</h3>
<p>Four Important Cases Decided</p>
<p>A quick dispatch from Xuzhou reports that the Xusu joint defense bandit suppression conference was formally held at the Xuzhou camp at 9:00 AM on the 21st, after He Yaozu returned to Xuzhou. The camp notified the representatives to attend in advance. Those who signed in at the time included Yang Wei, the county magistrate of Tongshan County; Du Guangchen and Jiang Qiaosheng, representatives of Suqian; Wen Qinming, the county magistrate of Suining; Zhu Bichen, the representative of Suining; Luo Yuanye, the county magistrate of Pi County; Chen Yuanquan, the representative of Pi County; Yang Liang, the county magistrate of Feng County; Zhu Dunden, the police captain of Feng County; Xu Enzhao, the county magistrate of Pei County; Huang Jingru and Zheng Yunchiao, representatives of Xiao County; Wang Hualan, the representative of Dangshan; Wang Xiaoyi and Liu Yihua, representatives of Su County; Zhan Zhen, Chief of Staff of the camp; Wang Taiqi, Director of the Staff Office; He Jingxun, Director of the Secretariat Office; Gong Yuncun, Director of the Political Training Office; Song Runtian, the Xuzhou Garrison Commander; Fan Zichun, the commander of Feng, Dang, and Xiao counties, and others. He Yaozu personally presided over the meeting, and Huang Guoxiong recorded the minutes. The meeting was arranged in a square format, solemn and orderly. After the meeting began, the chairman first reported the significance of the meeting, and then each representative reported the strength of the militia and police forces and the situation of bandit suppression. Then, the proposals, including those submitted by the camp and joint proposals from the representatives, were discussed in detail. The meeting ended at about 1:00 PM. He hosted a banquet for the representatives at the camp, which was very enjoyable. After the banquet, the representatives returned on the 22nd and 23rd. The content of the resolutions, after being organized by the camp, will be publicly announced in four key points: (1) Organize a joint bandit suppression office for the eight counties of Xuzhou to plan and command in a unified manner; (2) The camp will find ways to allocate bandit suppression bullets and try to replenish them; (3) The expenses for bandit suppression outside the borders of each county will be raised by each county as a regular expenditure; (4) The garrison forces of each county should cooperate with the stationed troops. It is heard that the responsibility for bandit suppression command will be borne by Song Runtian, the Xuzhou Garrison Commander. The office will be attached to the camp. As the season for green gauze curtains is about to pass, it will be easier to encircle and suppress the bandits in each county. Also, Zhao Jie, the garrison commander of the Second Army Corps, previously recruited old troops in the Xulu area to organize a garrison army. The composition was complex, and there were often cases of mistakenly recruiting bandits. Each county often hesitated to attack these bandits during the encirclement and suppression. Now, the Xuzhou camp has ordered him to abolish the name of the garrison army, and all the recruited troops in various places have been dissolved. Commander Song has also received a letter ordering him to announce a ban on anyone using the name of the garrison army to swindle. The boundaries between bandits and civilians in Xuzhou are now clear. After the representatives of each county return to their counties, they will engage in active deployment, and it is hoped that the bandits will be completely eliminated in a short period of time.

<h3>Japanese Demand Resumption of Traffic on Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The battles in the Zihe area of the Jiaoji Railway have been fierce in recent days. Since the traffic on the railway was interrupted on the 6th of this month, the general merchants have been greatly inconvenienced, and the food supply for the Japanese expatriates residing in Jinan, Zhoucun, and Zhangdian, which relied on Qingdao as a source, has been exhausted due to the interruption of the railway. The Jinan Japanese expatriate organization's Situation Committee has held repeated meetings and decided to telegraph the Japanese government to negotiate with our authorities to resume traffic on the Jiaoji Railway. The telegram has been sent. The Japanese Consul Nishida, accompanied by Liang Shangdong, Director of the Jiaoji Railway Administration, Kagamiyama, the Japanese Chief of the Traffic Department, and Du Chunyi, the commander of the Guard Division, went to Jinlingzhen by special train at 7:45 AM yesterday (the 18th) to meet Zhang Yinwu to negotiate the resumption of traffic. They returned to Jinan by the same train at 7:15 PM in the afternoon. According to Nishida, they arrived at Jinlingzhen at 11:00 AM this morning and negotiated the issue of traffic resumption on the special train occupied by Zhang Yinwu. Zhang indicated that traffic could be resumed, but he could not be responsible for the eastern section until the battles were resolved. Nishida said that the eastern section would be negotiated by the Qingdao Japanese Consul Kawahara with Han Fuju's army in Weixian, and traffic could be resumed as long as Han agreed. Zhang also agreed. After the conversation, Nishida and others had lunch on the train, while Liang Shangdong, Du Chunyi, and others got off the train to Zhang Yinwu's headquarters for a meeting. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they returned to Jinan by the same train. As for the battle front and the areas south of the railway, the two armies are still confronting each other across the Zihe River. There were no battles today. There were fierce battles to the north of the railway near Zibo, and the outcome is unknown. (July 19)</p>
<h3>Shandong Yellow River Water Rises</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: The flood season on the Yellow River in this province has arrived, and the water level has risen sharply in recent days, posing a dangerous situation. Li Guojun, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed Jinan yesterday for urgent help. The original text is as follows: "Most Urgent Jinan Provincial Government, Acting Chairman Deng, Finance Department Director Song, My respectful regards. Having just sent a telegram, I believe you have granted careful consideration. I have now received an urgent telegram from Zhao, Section Chief of the River Affairs Bureau, relayed by Commander Zhang of Jinlingzhen, Director Li Jun of the River Affairs Bureau, my respectful regards, original telegram respectfully noted. The river water has risen repeatedly by five feet four inches. Reports from each section regarding dangers and requests for funds are unanswered, causing extreme anxiety. I respectfully urge you to quickly telegraph to allocate funds, etc. Upon investigation, the river water has risen sharply by more than five feet, posing an extreme danger. Should there be continuous heavy rain, a major disaster will inevitably occur. I beg you to quickly take measures to protect the entire Shandong situation. Otherwise, Guojun will have no choice but to resign, especially for this crime. The matter is urgent and pressing. I sincerely hope you will quickly issue orders. Li Guojun bows respectfully, deleted Hai seal."</p>
<p>○ Bandit leader Ji Xiaoxi executed in Qingdao, Municipal Government wanted Sui Shiqing</p>
<p>Commodity Donation Bureau Collects Donations As Usual</p>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: Ji Xiaoxi, the commander of the bandit army who harassed Jiaoxian, was captured by the marine corps in Chengyang on the 20th and was escorted to Qingdao that night for interrogation. At that time, Navy Commander Shen Honglie happened to be at Xuejiadao inspecting his troops and was not in Qingdao. The command sent the Haihe艇 to meet Shen. Shen returned to Qingdao at 6:00 PM on the 21st and interrogated Ji and others. Ji confessed to the cases of looting and rape in Jiaozhou. Shen, considering that Ji's crimes were obvious, telegraphed Han Fuju for his consent and decided to execute him in Qingdao. At 6:00 PM on the 22nd, Li Yucheng, Director of the Qingdao Naval Office, and Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Qingdao Office of the First Army Corps, led the naval marine corps in two cars to escort Ji Xiaoxi and Wang Zenggui (Director of the Bandit Army Inspection Office) and Dong Zhenxiang (Captain of the Bandit Army) to the Tuandao execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>Sui Shiqing, the former chairman of the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce, willingly submitted to Zhang Zongchang during his time and framed the party member Hu Xinzhi. The family of Hu reported it, and the Municipal Steering Committee also sent a letter to the Municipal Government requesting a thorough investigation. After accepting the case, the Municipal Government sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. Yesterday, it ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly arrest Sui and bring him to justice. The Municipal Government's instructions are recorded as follows: "The case was approved by the Municipal Steering Committee, requesting a strict investigation and handling of Sui Shiqing, the former chairman of the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce, for flattering warlords and framing party member Hu Xinzhi, in order to deter the wicked, and a summary of Hu Xinzhi's deeds is attached. After investigation, Sui Shiqing willingly submitted to the warlords and framed party members. A strict investigation and handling are necessary to deter the wicked. In addition to responding to the letter, this order is copied and issued to the bureau, requesting that it be immediately followed and ordered to subordinate units to investigate, arrest, and bring Sui Shiqing to justice."</p>
<p>The Qingdao Commodity Unified Donation Bureau was previously attacked by merchants who paid donations due to unanimous opposition from the business community. The Qingdao General Chamber of Commerce also petitioned the authorities to temporarily suspend the collection of unified donations to relieve the merchants' difficulties. Yesterday, the Provincial Government Office in Qingdao issued a special announcement stating that it would be difficult to suspend the collection of donations before receiving the Ministry's order to revoke it. The announcement is as follows: "The Qingdao General Chamber of Commerce has petitioned to transfer the Qingdao Bank Association and other petitions to temporarily suspend the unified commodity donation. The government's 103rd Standing Committee meeting resolved to order the Finance Department to reconsider and handle the matter. The Finance Department submitted a reply stating that the provincial commodity unified donation is similar to Likin donations and taxes. The department has repeatedly received orders from the Ministry of Finance stating that all similar Likin donations and taxes should be combined with the national Likin abolition plan on October 10 of this year. Before the Ministry's order to revoke the provincial commodity unified donation is received, it is not appropriate to suspend the collection of donations without authorization. It is difficult to approve the Chamber of Commerce's request to temporarily suspend the collection of unified commodity donations. In addition to ordering the bureau to collect donations as usual, it is proposed to ask your government to issue a public announcement and order the Qingdao General Chamber of Commerce to properly guide and continue to pay donations to enrich the treasury. In addition to ordering approval to proceed and ordering the Qingdao General Chamber of Commerce to comply, this public announcement is issued for all merchants and banks to comply with." (July 23) ○ Hunan-Hubei Joint Suppression of Pingliuyue Communist Bandits Peng Dehuai Withdraws from Pingjiang County on the 20th</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch: The Communist bandits Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Kong Hezong, and others, with a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 people and 7,000 to 8,000 guns (this is the number reported by He Jian on July 14 during the enlarged memorial week at Zhongshan Hall), took advantage of the emptiness in the rear after the expedition against the Guangxi army to repeatedly occupy Pingjiang, Liuyang, Yueyang, and other places. As for the Communist bandits in Pingjiang, they had advanced to Yong'an City, 90 li from the provincial capital. After the Second Division of Hubei and the Wang Dongyuan Brigade of the 15th Division of Hunan exerted great efforts to suppress them, Liuyang and Yueyang were gradually recovered. However, Pingjiang is still occupied by the Peng bandits. He Jian therefore transferred the entire Luo Shujia Brigade of the 19th Division to Changsha to join forces with the entire 15th Division and the entire Luo Lin Division of Hubei (the commander of the division, Wei Suzhong, also serves as the commander of the bandit suppression in Pingliuyue). All bandit suppression troops in Hunan and Hubei provinces are under his command, with specific responsibility for their suppression plan, which is as follows: (1) The Luo Shujia Brigade of the 19th Division will advance from Changsha along the Yong'an City Pujia Avenue towards Liuyang. (2) The Hou Pengfei and Wang Zhibin Brigades of the 15th Division will advance from Changsha along the Jinjing Avenue towards Pingjiang. (3) The Wang Dongyuan Brigade of the 15th Division and the Luo Lin Division of Hubei will exchange regiments and advance from Yuezhou along Gangkou Yanglin towards Pingjiang. (4) The Hubei Division Commander Luo Lin will lead a portion of the troops from Tongcheng towards Pingjiang. (5) A telegram will be sent to Chairman Lu of Jiangxi Province requesting that troops be sent to block the area around Xiushui Tonggu. (6) Rong Ke's aircraft will be dispatched to temporarily come under the command of Division Commander Wei to assist in attacking the Communist bandits in Pingliuyue. The above troops were all dispatched before the 18th. Wei Suzhong departed from the province on the morning of the 19th to command the suppression campaign in Pingjiang. All duties of the Changsha Division Headquarters were specially delegated to Chief of Staff Liu Ying to act on behalf of them, and the duties of the provincial capital garrison commander were delegated to Deputy Brigade Commander Guo Tao to act on behalf of them. Each route army was scheduled to mobilize simultaneously on the 20th and advance towards Pingliuyue. Rong Ke's aircraft flew to Pingliuyue early on the 20th to reconnaissance and assist. The plane returned to Changsha at 12:00 PM that day and reported that the Peng bandit troops in Pingjiang had moved towards Changshou Street, with no more than one regiment of bandits in the city. A considerable number of Communist bandits in Liuyang were scattered in the vicinity of the county seat, 30 to 40 li away, especially in the north and south townships. The government troops are rushing towards Liuyang. Also, according to the Pingjiang Fellow Association, Peng Dehuai, seeing the advance of the large army, had withdrawn from Pingjiang County on the 20th. This suppression campaign, excluding the blockers in Jiangxi, involves a total of two divisions and one brigade from Hunan and Hubei provinces. He Jian limited the time to one month to completely eliminate the bandits. When Division Commander Wei departed, in order to expand the anti-Communist propaganda, he posted announcements in Pingliuyue counties as follows: "It is hereby known that the Peng Huang Communist bandits have taken advantage of the emptiness to disturb Liujiang, killing, setting fires, and extorting, all of which are beastly acts. The villages have become ruins, and the fields and gardens are desolate everywhere. Parents and wives are separated, truly like being in hot fire and deep water. This headquarters has been ordered to advance and join the armies of the three provinces, with the aim of completely annihilating them and rescuing the people from their misery. Communists and bandits are originally an unruly mob, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them soon. Encirclement and suppression are now being carried out, with the goal of eradicating the roots. Communist bandits are indeed unforgivable, but those who blindly follow should reform themselves. If they repent and return, the government will still allow them to surrender. If they can return with their guns, rewards have been clearly stated. If they still indulge and do not return, it is their own fault. Once they are suppressed, captured, and punished, they will never be lenient. Soldiers and people unite with one heart to eliminate the red atmosphere. Local people should guide and report the situation of the bandits in detail. If anyone dares to collude with Communist bandits, harbor them privately, deliberately spread rumors to confuse the public, they will all be punished with severe penalties. If any unscrupulous soldiers dare to oppress the good people, force them to borrow, buy, or sell, disturb, kidnap, rape, they are allowed to point them out and accuse them, and they will be severely punished according to the law. The four classes of people should live in peace and not suspect each other. This announcement is hereby issued for all to follow." (July 20)</p>
<h3>Min Army Advances in Multiple Routes to Suppress Lu</h3>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: The third phase of the military campaign to suppress Lu is about to begin. The advance team of Liu's division took the road through Gutian, Minqing, Yongtai, and other places to move towards Shuikou. The main forces on the northwest routes also continued to depart. The Zha Yongjun regiment on the west route advanced from Wenshan Puli to Xiaobeiling and Nainai Ping. The 333rd regiment of Yan Zhaomin's troops, the 334th regiment of Jiang Yan's troops, and the 332nd regiment of Li Huan's troops advanced simultaneously. There were also mortar, mountain artillery, machine gun, landmine, bomb, hygiene, communications, logistics, and engineer battalions all departing for the front. The Liu Tang regiment remained in the rear as a reserve force stationed in Donghu awaiting orders. On the naval front, the Lin Pingnan regiment of the Second Marine Brigade has departed from Nangang and advanced towards Yongtai. The Nangang defenses left behind were filled by the Huang Maohe regiment of the First Brigade. The Huang regiment arrived in Nangang the night before. The southern Fujian armies had previously been blocked by the issue of competing for the stationing of Quanzhou. Now, the Chen battalion of the Second Marine Brigade has arrived in Quanzhou to take over. Gao Jingli withdrew to Honglai according to orders. The teaching regiment telegraphed the province to declare that the misunderstanding with Gao Jingli did not involve attacking Jinjiang. Chen Guohui has been designated Yongchun Dehua Datian as the defense area, and it is also heard that the provincial government telegraphed Chen's army to attack Youxi from Datian. Chen's troops are expected to reach Datian within a week. The entire First Regiment of Zhang's division and one battalion each of the Second and Third Regiments are concentrated in Zhangzhou and are departing with the teaching regiment. Another message states that Zhang Zhen decided to transfer Zhang Rukuan's brigade and transport it to Xiamen on more than 200 civilian ships. It is expected that they will transfer from Xiamen to the province in three to four days to assist Liu's division in advancing against the Lu troops on the front. Whether this statement is true or not remains to be reported.</p>

The Management Office was canceled, and Lin Zhaohong was transferred to be an inspector. There were slight changes in staff and clerks, which are also omitted. Chairman Yang's return to Fujian comes at a time when the province's finances are extremely difficult. Monthly revenue and expenditure do not cover the expenditure of 300,000 yuan. Regarding measures to reorganize finances, on the one hand, he plans to make great efforts to reorganize national and local tax revenues, gradually increasing those that should be increased and gradually implementing those that should be implemented. On the other hand, he plans to make great efforts to economize on government expenses. However, how He will handle matters after taking office and whether he can fully meet Liu's expectations remains a question. (July 22)</p>

<h3>Communist Disaster in Yongfeng and Xingguo, Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Luo Binghui's Band Enters Xingan and Qingjiang</p>
<p>Half a Year of Terror in Xingguo</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Yongfeng in western Jiangxi is located east of the Gan River and borders Xiajiang, Jishui, and Le'an. It has always been an area where Communist bandits appear and disappear. It has been captured by bandits more than once in recent years. Currently, Communist bandit Luo Binghui led a bandit crowd of 24 regiments, about 3,000 to 4,000 people, to besiege the county seat at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month. The county magistrate immediately directed the police force to engage in fierce battles with the bandits. However, due to the disparity in numbers and the exhaustion of ammunition, the county seat was finally captured by the bandits on the 18th. The burning and killing were extremely cruel. Currently, Song Yanzhen, the director of the county suppression association, and Wu Jiasheng, the director of the construction bureau, have fled to the provincial capital overnight to request the provincial government for troops and assistance. After receiving the report, Chairman Lu has dispatched nearby stationed troops to suppress the bandits. However, Luo Binghui, after capturing Yongfeng, colluded with Huang Gonglue and moved east along the Gan River, invading the territory of Xingan and Qingjiang (60 li from Zhangshu and 100 li from the province). Chairman Lu then telegraphed Deng's division to cross the river east from Ji'an Jishui, the 52nd Brigade to cross the river east from Xiajiang, and the 54th Brigade to move west from Le'an in Fuzhou, encircling Yongfeng and Xingan from three sides. Yesterday, he also transferred the 106th Regiment of the 53rd Brigade stationed on the Nanxun Road to Zhangshu overnight by Nanzhang Road car to block Qingjiang and Xingan territory to prevent them from collapsing downstream along the Gan River. The heavy arrangement is very strict, and it is difficult for the cunning bandits to escape the net.</p>
<p>Xingguo in southern Jiangxi is the location of the Donggu bandit den and has long been reduced to Communist bandit burning and killing. According to a visitor from the county, the county seat has not been recovered since it was captured by the bandits in January and remains in a state of high alert. A Soviet government has also been established in the county. The former chairman, Xiao Fangquan, was a dock porter, and the current chairman, Wang Chengshi, was a carpenter. The county committee includes Xiao Yizuo, Chen Qishi, Huang Jiahuang, Qiu Zanping, Education Minister Xie Wenzhen, Military and Political Minister Zou Rixin, Finance Minister Xie Wenzhen, Women's Minister Zhong Renyu, and Civil Affairs Minister Xiao Yizuo. Qiu Hupei is the commander of the guerrilla teams in the three counties of Xingguo, Taihe, and others. More than 20 district Soviet governments and more than 300 village Soviet governments have been established. The people have been murdered, fields have been divided, and wives have been made public. In the past two months, more than 80 people have been tragically killed in Fengbian. Bai Shi, Yang Shaofu (former Qing scholar), his five sons, and three grandsons, a total of nine men and women, were killed together. Zhong, a young widow, maintained her chastity. The Communist Party asked her to choose one of nine men to marry, but she refused and was beheaded and displayed to the public. Xiao Yizuo, of the county committee, proposed that since the county's land and property were not enough to distribute, all the lame, deaf, blind, and elderly over sixty years old should be killed to avoid dividing the benefits. Such tragedies are too numerous to mention and are truly hell on earth.</p>
<p>As for Xunwu, which is far from the Guangdong border, it was captured by bandits before. On July 1, it was recovered by the county police force. The bandits in Ruichang, northern Jiangxi, are also reorganizing. The bandit leader Yang Kaiyuan led more than 100 guns, and the bandit leader Jiang Youmei of Zhuhu led dozens of guns, and successively fled into Yangxin, Hubei, to rely on Peng Dehuai. Jingdezhen in eastern Jiangxi has returned to order and tranquility as usual since the Fang bandits withdrew. (July 23)</p>
<h3>Great Early Rice Harvest in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Decides to Resume Rice Export</p>
<p>It is Expected to Export 600,000 Dan in Four Months</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province has always been a rice-producing area. Last year, due to the widespread banditry and insect plagues, a rice shortage occurred that had never been seen before. Subsequently, the government exerted all its efforts to maintain the situation by purchasing a large quantity of foreign rice in Shanghai and implementing price controls, thus managing to overcome the difficulties. However, since the beginning of this year, rainfall has been even, and the early rice crops in all areas are lush and verdant. The farmers believe that a bumper harvest can be expected, and they are all overjoyed. Now that the harvest season has arrived, according to reports from various counties, this year's early rice harvest is more abundant than ever before. New grain from the suburbs of Nanchang has also flooded in. Chen Jiadong, the Director of the Department of Finance, believes that the province's financial activity depends entirely on the circulation of rice. Furthermore, since there is already a bumper harvest this year, cheap grain will inevitably hurt farmers. He has therefore proposed to the provincial government to lift the ban on rice exports in order to increase the province's revenue. It is reported that the provincial government believes that this will benefit both the province's revenue and the prospects of the social economy and has approved the request. It has also limited the Department of Finance to issue rice export permits for 600,000 dan within these four months, 150,000 dan per month. A tax of one or two yuan per dan of rice permit can increase tax revenue by around one million yuan. Considering each dan of rice is temporarily calculated at ten yuan, it can absorb six to seven million yuan in cash. The social economy is expected to improve slightly in the future. At the moment, merchants in the provincial capital are preparing for rice exports. The new grain can still be sold for six yuan per dan, and each dan of rice is priced at around thirteen yuan.</p>
<h3>A Terrible Train Derailment on the Harbin-Changchun Line</h3>
<p>Occurred Between Shuangcheng and Wujia Stations</p>
<p>Three Carriages Fell Into the Water, Seven Derailed</p>
<p>Sixteen Passengers Were Injured</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: At 10:45 PM on the 18th, the third express train from Harbin to Changchun, consisting of one first-class sleeping car, one second-class sleeping car, two third-class sleeping cars, one postal car, one baggage car, and six ordinary third-class carriages, carrying over three hundred Chinese and foreign passengers, at 12:15 AM, when passing the Wujia Station, 40 kilometers south of Harbin, suddenly derailed due to the rotting of the railway tracks and sleepers which could not bear the weight of the train. Except for the locomotive, baggage car, and first-class sleeping car, which remained safe, one second-class sleeping car and two third-class sleeping cars were detached and derailed. Due to the excessive force, they rolled off the roadbed and into the river. Over thirty passengers were asleep and were overturned into the silt with the carriages. They sustained minor and serious injuries due to the impact. Fortunately, the river was not deep, and the carriages did not break, allowing them to climb out. The carriages behind the third-class sleeping cars, except for one postal car, were all derailed, with the front halves of the carriages all buried in the roadbed. Over 160 meters of railway tracks were destroyed by the wheels. When the accident occurred, the passengers were all frightened and screaming due to the sudden event late at night, and many lost their belongings. Afterwards, the passengers got off the train and stood on the tracks. The railway protection troops from the nearby Wujia Station, fearing further accidents, dispatched a company of soldiers to protect the scene. At 1 AM on the 19th, a rescue train from Harbin transported the injured passengers and those who wanted to return their tickets to Harbin. The 12th train, which was supposed to arrive in Harbin at 6:55 AM on the 19th, had its passengers transferred from Shuangcheng to Harbin on the rescue train. The passengers of the third train that had the accident transferred to the 12th train to Changchun. The traffic between Harbin and Changchun was still not restored by late evening, although a group of workers sent by the Railway Bureau and led by the Chief of Works went to repair the tracks at 10 AM today. The passengers who had purchased tickets for the train scheduled to depart for Changchun at 9:15 AM had already boarded, but the train remained stationary at the main station all day due to the unrepaired tracks. Among the injured passengers, there were eleven Chinese (including three women) and five Russians (including two women). Nine of the more lightly injured were transported to Harbin and sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. The more seriously injured were transported to Shuangcheng for treatment. (19th)</p>

The contract will be signed at the General Chamber of Commerce this afternoon (24th), but after deducting the various interest payments, the municipal government will actually receive only more than 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The People's Food Council is Closing: The Ningbo City and County People's Food Relief Committee held its fifth temporary meeting yesterday (23rd) and decided to recommend two members, Zhou Xunzhai and Zhuo Baoting, to go to the Qin Mansion and rice merchants to handle the closure. For Tai's generous donation, it was requested that the city and county governments forward it to the central government for generous awards.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Workers Gather to Fight: Workers in the local rice industry have long had a distinction between long and short shifts, which has often led to disputes between the two sides. At around 8:00 PM last night (23rd), seventy or eighty workers from the local rice industry's long and short shifts suddenly gathered at the Chongxinglou Tea House in Jiangdong. It was heard that the conflict started over the issue of Cai Axi, originally from the long shift, joining the association. At first, there was a verbal argument, which then escalated into a mutual fight. As a result, many people on both sides were injured. The police from the first branch of the third district were dispatched to the scene to stop the fight and sent the injured to the court for examination and investigation.</p>
<p>The Chief of the Yin County Public Security Sub-Bureau is Dismissed: Lu Jiaqi, the chief of the Yinjiangqiao Public Security Sub-Bureau in Yin County, and Xu Youliang, the chief of the Jiangshan Public Security Sub-Bureau, were both dismissed by the provincial government due to a lack of police knowledge and a pending case.

<h3>Efforts for Independent Education Funding in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>The Central School Federation Issues a Long Declaration</p>
<p>Before the arrival of the National Revolutionary Army, a portion of the education funding in Anhui Province was earmarked from the cigarette tax. After the Ministry of Finance changed the cigarette tax to a national tax in the 16th year of the Republic, the education sector repeatedly sought to maintain the old system. After a long period of negotiation, the Ministry of Finance allocated 1.2 million yuan annually from the national tax Lijin to compensate for the remaining gap, which was borne by the provincial treasury. However, the arrears of fees for the current semester have reached 100,000 yuan, and the salaries for June and July have not yet been paid. In the new budget for the 19th year, education funding has increased, and local taxes should bear more than 700,000 yuan. The education sector is well aware that if special funds are not designated, the next semester will be even more difficult. The Provincial Education Funding Management Office has carefully planned and requested the provincial government to allocate the Datong salt tax surcharge as its special fund. Once this proposal was put forward, it was widely supported. Recently, the Provincial Federation of Secondary Schools also issued a lengthy declaration, citing the examples of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces, vowing to fight to the death for this cause. The atmosphere is extremely intense.</p>
<h3>Textbook Compilation Process of the Ministry of Education (Continued)</h3>
<p>1. Selection Principles: The selection of materials is based on the principle of Sanmin Zhuyi. All materials concerning natural science, hygiene, history, geography, national morality, etc., are based on the posthumous works of the Premier. When necessary, the most essential common knowledge will be extracted from the various elementary school textbooks and popular readers approved by the Ministry of Education as supplements, but still adhering to the principle of not deviating from the principles of our party. 2. Material Sources: Materials come from four sources: First, the posthumous works of the Premier (with special emphasis on Sanmin Zhuyi); this is the main source of materials. Second, various popular readers. Third, various approved elementary school textbooks. Fourth, the temporary standards for elementary school curricula promulgated by the Ministry of Education. 3. Selection Criteria: There are four selection criteria: (1) Must be essential common knowledge for understanding and agreeing with the party's principles. (2) Must be needed by the people. (3) Must be able to improve the lives of the people. (4) Must be able to introduce essential new characters. 4. Selection Procedures: First, the Material Selection Committee decides on the division of labor and designates personnel to collect materials. The second step is for each person to select materials relevant to the subject they are responsible for from the above four material sources, listing them all in a table with the aim of not leaving anything out. The third step is for each person to use common sense judgment based on the selection criteria to determine the relative importance of the materials listed in the table and select the most valuable materials (from twenty-five to fifty items, varying by subject). The fourth step is for each person to write the selected materials on cards, explaining the source of the materials and the key points they include, for reference during editing. Finally, convene a meeting of the Material Selection Committee. First, each person reports on the process of collection and selection, and then a detailed discussion is held on the selected materials, making a final decision. (3) Editing Textbook Materials: After the materials are selected, we proceed with the editing work. Because the Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi is divided into versions for children and adults, editing should be divided into two groups: a children's group and an adult group. Each group has three editors: one responsible for textbook design, illustration ideas, and editing instructional books; one responsible for drafting the textbook; and one responsible for correcting the text and general organization. Before editing, we first agreed on several editing principles: (1) The first principle is to make the meaning of the textbook extremely clear so that the people can understand the meaning as soon as they recognize the characters. Because if we can achieve this, not only can teachers teach well, but even if there are no teachers, the people can rely on the help of phonetic symbols to study on their own. To promote a national literacy campaign, we believe that we must edit the Thousand-Character Classic according to this principle. (2) Because the materials in this textbook are too rich and too profound, it is practically impossible to completely edit it according to the above principles. Therefore, we have to settle for second best. For the deeper materials on party principles and history and geography, we only aim to concentrate the difficult points on one or two points so that teachers can explain them clearly within twenty minutes. This is our second principle. (3) For materials on party principles, we must carefully consider every word and sentence to avoid various misunderstandings. This is our third principle. (4) The writing should be varied and, as far as possible, provide motivation for learning. This is our fourth principle.</p>
<p>Now, both of these Thousand-Character Classics have been compiled into four volumes, with twenty-two lessons in each volume. The process of editing the Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi has been roughly reported. Now, there are a few points that need to be added: (1) The editing of this Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi is entirely based on the key points for editing the Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi listed by the Central Training Department. The main guideline for editing is to popularize Sanmin Zhuyi. We all know that Chinese characters are very complex, and it is very difficult to make the people literate. We all also know that the theory of Sanmin Zhuyi is very profound, and it is extremely difficult to popularize it among the people. Now that we are putting two extremely difficult things together, this work is certainly very important and extremely interesting, but it is ultimately an unprecedented initiative that carries at least a bit of risk and experimentation. We are not very confident about how perfect we can make it. (2) The deadline for editing this Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi was the end of June. There was also a very complicated counting work in the middle. In fact, the time for editing the textbook was less than two months. It is too bold for us to complete such important and difficult work in such a short time. Therefore, this Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi is only intended as a temporary version for testing and research. After one year of testing and research, we will thoroughly revise it. (3) Because there are too few materials for this word selection, the results are not very reliable. We must expand the materials to 1.5 million characters and add precise statistics to complete an extremely valuable popular vocabulary. The results of this word selection are only temporarily adopted. In short, the editing of the Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi can only be said to be a small conclusion for now. We must continue to study it and continue to improve it. In the coming year, in addition to continuing to review textbooks and make great efforts to translate scientific terms, the Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education will make the revision of the Thousand-Character Classic on Sanmin Zhuyi a major task. We hope that by the end of December next year, we will be able to complete a valuable popular dictionary and a perfect basic literacy textbook to serve as a tool for promoting national literacy.

<h3>Davis Cup Winner: USA? France?</h3>
<p>News came that the United States overcame the European champion Italy to win the right to the 1930 Davis Cup Challenge Round. It will be held in July with the French, who have held the world championship for three years, at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris on the 5th, 6th, and 7th. It is difficult to predict the outcome, but it has long been closely watched by tennis enthusiasts around the world.</p>
<p>Recently, experts in the field have harshly criticized that France's winning streak is about to end. This is because only Cochet and Borotra of the four musketeers, who have dominated the world, are still in good shape. As for Brougnon, he is old and Lacoste has fulfilled his promise not to help his friends again. His retirement has had a great impact on France. Moreover, the French stars were completely defeated at this year's Wimbledon tournament. The impact on their strength is not small. Therefore, people generally worry about France's Davis Cup championship in 1930.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although Tilden and Hunter have retired from the United States, the players who are fighting this year are all young and strong new players. Since June, they have been transferred to England and France with outstanding results and have a preemptive advantage over their opponents. Allison and Van Ryn's doubles dare to determine their ability to win. However, there is no uneasiness in the singles. It is no wonder that the authorities keenly aware of this weakness urgently telegraphed the old general Tilden for his service.</p>
<p>Tennis king Cochet tarnished his reputation at the All England Championships, but it cannot be asserted that he will repeat his mistakes in the Challenge Round. Although Borotra was defeated by Tilden, his courage and fighting spirit should win a point in the singles for France. Then, the result will depend on how Allison's singles performance determines who wins the Davis Cup. Or, what we are interested in is how the victory or defeat will clearly indicate the dividing point between American tennis, which defends and overwhelms the world, and modern French tennis techniques. I hope readers will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Chinese Tennis Association Launches Open Doubles Tennis Championship</h3>

<h3>Jiangnan University Sports Association Convenes a Principals' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan University Sports Association sent a letter to the principals of the member schools, stating: "Respectfully, our association has been established for five years, and the sports competitions among the members have been held on a quarterly basis, with outstanding results in the Southeast. However, in this era of surging sports trends, the colleagues of our association deeply feel that simply holding sports competitions is not a fundamental way to promote sports. Moreover, our association lacks adequate contact with the administrative authorities of the member schools, so it has not been able to contribute to the organization and popularization of school sports. This is indeed a defect. Therefore, at the temporary meeting of the Executive Committee of our association on July 3, it was proposed that the member schools cooperate fully to publicly hire all-around instructors to rotate to each school for practical guidance in order to seek in-depth training, and it was unanimously passed. It was also decided that the staff department would be responsible for inviting the authorities of each school to gather and discuss the methods in a short period of time. It has been decided that the Principals' Meeting of each school will be held at 10:00 AM on August 3 (Sunday) at the China An Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai. The meeting concerns the future of sports in the member schools and the common development of the schools. We hope that you will attend or send a plenipotentiary representative to attend the meeting to discuss the progress together. Not only will the members of Jiangnan University benefit, but the national sports will also rely on it. This is specially reported to you.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Philippine-Japanese Boxing Dispute at the Far Eastern Games (Yan Hua)</h3>
<p>According to the Philippine Daily, an article by Teodoro, a physical education instructor at the Philippine National University, clarified the reason for the Philippines' abandonment of the final of the boxing open championship at the 9th Far Eastern Games. Teodoro was the coach at the time. He first said that although his team members were discouraged and disappointed by the unfair competition order and biased refereeing, they still tried their best to fight, and their attitude was commendable. Then, he listed in detail the unpleasant circumstances, all of which have been summarized and telegraphed by this newspaper and published in the special issue of the Far Eastern Games. I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy thing in Teodoro's article is his bold and outspokenness. He said that although Dr. Ylang Nan, the general coach of the Philippines at the time, strongly opposed the abandonment, this move was actually based on the fact that the Japanese Boxing Committee made a big mistake and acted arrogantly, so it had to take the final measure to warn them of all future responsibilities. He was willing to bear the responsibility, but he hoped that the public would see the right and wrong clearly.</p>
<p>Teodoro concluded by calling on his countrymen to pay attention and elaborated that if they want to win the championship in 1934, all sports must have the best training and preparation, and no effort should be spared. As far as boxing is concerned, Japan is not behind and the prosperity of this skill is increasing day by day. Amateur boxing matches are held every month to promote it. The Philippines only has a national conference held in February, which is a world apart. Although the Philippine players at the last Far Eastern Games were better in strategy and tactics, Japan will definitely catch up and make amazing progress in the next four years.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Order Requiring All Subordinates to Use National Products</h3>
<p>Implementation Regulations</p>
<p>Considering the current circumstances of soaring gold prices and rising prices of foreign goods, the Municipal Government believes it is an opportune time to encourage the people to promote national products to stem the outflow of wealth. To take the lead in advocating and shifting the trend, the Social Affairs Bureau has drafted over ten articles on the use of national products. These were presented to the Municipal Council for discussion and passed yesterday. The implementation regulations are recorded below: Shanghai Municipal Government's Implementation Regulations for Promoting the Use of National Products (A) Regarding usage: (1) From July 1st, the 19th year of the Republic of China, all bureaus under this government, during office hours, shall require all staff and public servants to wear national product clothing. Previously purchased foreign clothing may be worn until worn out, but no new purchases shall be made to set an example. The responsible officials shall strictly supervise and prohibit any violations, which will be included in performance evaluations. (2) All daily necessities such as stationery, paper, utensils, sundries, decorations, cosmetics, consumables, and luxury goods needed by this government and its affiliated agencies shall be ordered from the respective administrative personnel. If national products are available for purchase, foreign goods must absolutely not be purchased. (3) If there are foreign goods that cannot be replaced by national products, it would be best to completely avoid using them. If it is absolutely necessary, purchases should be made sparingly. (4) Except for entertaining foreign guests, all banquets shall use national product meals and shall not include foreign goods such as tobacco and alcohol. (5) All public officials shall wear national product clothing for newly purchased clothing, except for diplomats. The Social Affairs Bureau and the National Products Exhibition Hall shall conduct thorough investigations into substitutes for Western suits for application. (6) All members of this government and its subordinates shall be responsible for supervising their families at all times, guiding their clans, relatives, neighbors, villages, and friends at all times, and promoting the use of national products to the general public at all times. (7) The Bureau of Education shall instruct schools in the city to require all staff and students to wear national product clothing from the start of the autumn semester of the 19th year of the Republic of China. School supplies and student supplies shall be purchased as much as possible from national products. Students should be nurtured to have a concept of enjoying the use of national products. (8) This government shall attach these regulations and separately send letters to all agencies and organizations in the city to effectively promote the use of national products. (B) Regarding production and sales: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau shall order the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all stores to display national products separately within a time limit, solemnly publicize unified market prices, and ensure fair prices so that people are happy to purchase them. If there are national products that can replace foreign goods, efforts must be made to purchase national products. (2) The Social Affairs Bureau shall supervise and guide the National Products Exhibition Hall to dispatch personnel for inspection and guidance at any time. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau shall organize the Shanghai National Products Production and Sales Basic Association to enable the three parties of production, sales, and consumption to cooperate fully. (3) The Social Affairs Bureau shall organize a National Products Research Association, convene representatives from various manufacturers and experts from various industries to gather ideas and insights, and carefully study factory equipment, management, transportation, and sales matters to reduce the cost of products and increase the production and sales of national products. (4) The Social Affairs Bureau shall supervise and guide the National Products Exhibition Hall to set up chain-style national product stores in prosperous commercial areas within the city to effectively regulate the production and sales of national products. (5) The Social Affairs Bureau shall supervise and guide the National Products Exhibition Hall to reorganize the City Temple and Yu Garden to organize a large-scale national product market for sensation. (6) The Social Affairs Bureau shall supervise and guide the National Products Exhibition Hall to hold national product exhibitions suitable for the seasons at any time, and promote, lecture, and encourage citizens to purchase national products, sell national products, and manufacture national products. (7) Confidentially submit to the central government that, before the implementation of tariff protection policies, regardless of national or foreign goods, tax rates should be increased uniformly to show equal treatment for both Chinese and foreign merchants. At the same time, the increased tax revenue shall be used to subsidize national product manufacturers and reward bonuses to encourage them.</p>
<h3>Indian Correspondent in China Discusses Developing Trade with India</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send letters to relevant groups for verification</p>
<p>Yesterday, an Indian man named Sumei Pu Laji went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and claimed that he was a correspondent in China for various newspapers in Ceylon, Calcutta, etc. Upon seeing a Western newspaper in this city reporting that the Chinese Consul in Calcutta had petitioned the government to promote national products while Indians were formally boycotting British goods, he came to meet and inform them that if the Chamber of Commerce or commercial groups had any progress on this matter or planned to send people to India to investigate, he would, by virtue of his duty, first notify the Indian newspapers for reception and assistance. He would notify them of any concrete plans. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce staff inquired whether Chinese goods were easily sold in the Indian market. Mr. Su replied that since the occurrence of non-violent resistance in India, the entire country has been boycotting British goods. Currently, British goods in the Indian market have fallen by 23%, replaced by Japanese goods. If Chinese goods can seize this opportunity to vigorously promote sales, they will be welcomed throughout India. However, it would be best to send people to investigate to avoid closed-door policymaking and achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had confidentially ordered the Chamber to forward Mr. Su's statement to the silk industry and various commercial associations, requesting them to carefully dispatch specialists to take samples and conduct investigations in various parts of India. However, no reply has been received to date. Now, Mr. Su's statement further confirms the Ministry's order, indicating a good opportunity to expand foreign trade, which should not be missed. Therefore, yesterday, another letter was sent to the silk industry and various national product associations to handle the matter jointly and reply to the Chamber as soon as possible for a decision.</p>
<h3>Mo Chunyi Discusses Saving the Nation Through Production</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Overseas Chinese Industry Investigation Group has been in Shanghai for several days. Previous reports briefly mentioned their activities. Yesterday, a reporter visited and inquired about the latest developments. Mr. Mo Chunyi, a representative of the group, told the reporter that our country has vast land and abundant resources, but why is the country still poor and the people impoverished? This is because the entire country, from top to bottom, does not engage in production, causing goods to be abandoned on the land. It is no wonder that the country's economy and people's livelihoods are becoming increasingly impoverished. If we want to save the nation today, mere empty talk will not succeed. There is no better strategy than for the entire country, from top to bottom, to work together with one heart and one mind to engage in production. However, production cannot be achieved through empty talk either. There is no other way than to gather large amounts of capital. At a time when internal strife has not subsided, it may be difficult to raise capital domestically for the time being. Therefore, after much deliberation, the members of our group have united and decided to set an example for the country by starting to take action. The strategy is to investigate the current situation of various industries to determine the direction and proceed gradually to avoid failure. The capital raising stage is divided into three phases. The first phase is to raise 20 million, the second phase is to raise another 20 million, and the third phase is to raise 100 million. Considering the vast scale of our country's production industries, it is difficult to talk about production without such capital. When starting an industry in the future, the government should be asked to grant special rights and provide reliable guarantees before it can be considered.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Silver and Money Industry Accepting Rice Grain Mortgage</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Sends Letter of Inquiry</p>
<p>According to the Wuchen News Agency, there have been rumors in the city that the silver and money industry in this city has successively accepted rice grain mortgages amounting to 20 million yuan. Rice merchants, confident and fearless, are still thinking of insisting on not selling. It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the report, is concerned that although new rice has entered the market, the period of transition between the old and new rice harvests has not completely passed. If large quantities of rice are indeed supported by the financial activities of the silver and money industry, insisting on not selling may enable certain unscrupulous merchants to monopolize and hoard goods, endangering people's food supply, which is not insignificant. To prevent problems before they arise, the bureau yesterday sent a letter to the Silver and Money Association to find out the total amount of mortgages and the quantity and storage locations of rice grains undertaken by various firms, so as to prevent and control.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Strike Yesterday's News</h3>
<p>Tram Service Completely Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>As the French Concession Water and Electricity Strike escalated, the situation became increasingly tense. The number of strikers in the union also increased daily. Ticket sellers and Chinese staff continued to join until last night. The total number of participants has reached over 1,200. The details of yesterday's events are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tram Suspension The company has had no control over tram operations recently. From yesterday, all tram services have been suspended. It is said that the reason for the suspension came from the French Consul's initiative, as the situation was not sustainable in the long run and assigning patrol officers to protect the trams would easily cause misunderstandings about the police force from the outside world.</p>
<p>Chinese Staff Joining Chinese senior staff have now unanimously joined and adopted the same actions as the workers. They have also filled out voluntary guarantee letters to show their faith. There is a proposal to change the name of the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union to the French Concession Water and Electricity Employees' Union, which is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>Representative Returns to Shanghai After the tragedy occurred, the Kuomintang Party headquarters, considering the seriousness of the situation, specially sent Comrade Yang Qingyuan to Beijing to report and request protests and negotiations. Yang returned to Shanghai the night before last. It is said that the results were quite good.</p>
<p>Union Congress The union held a general strike congress at the Public Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. Over 1,000 employees attended. Zhang Yaoming from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Qinglin from the Social Affairs Bureau, Xu Shaochuan, Li Yongxiang, Lu Jingshi, and others from the Support Association attended. Chairman Xu Amei first reported, followed by a discussion of important cases: (1) Warn strikebreakers and lackeys not to drive trams again, otherwise, they will be dealt with with full force. (2) Conduct a thorough investigation of strikebreakers and lackeys for verification.

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Responds to the Municipal Association Regarding the Telephone in the Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association yesterday replied to the Shanghai Special District Citizen's United Association, stating: In reply to your letter of July 22, regarding the telephone issue in the concession, the Association immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs upon receiving its dispatch, opening Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Junjian's note, informing that according to the report of the Chinese Directors, the telephone issue in the concession was discussed at the Municipal Council meeting on June 11, and the Chinese Directors presented the general meaning of the letter received from the Ministry of Communications and immediately notified the Bureau in writing for serious consideration, but the Municipal Council has not yet received the diplomatic document, etc., which is considered that the case should be handled in two steps (1) The Municipal Council should no longer approve the exclusive operating rights of the telephone company (2) The price and procedures for acquiring the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company should be negotiated with personnel, such as the price negotiation is not harmonious, a neutral valuation committee should be set up, and the report of the valuation committee has legal effect. It should be stated that the case should be handled in this way and respectfully pray for inspection, etc., and a letter was sent to the Municipal Council, opening the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's service efficiency is known to your Bureau for a long time, and the company also knows its weaknesses, so recently there has been a sale to other companies to take over, but the telephone is a public utility and affects traffic in various places. If the management and system of telephone in one place are not the same as those in other places, it will be difficult to complete the convenience of traffic. Looking at the world, most telephone businesses adopt state-owned or municipal-owned methods, and our country adopts state-owned methods to facilitate the convenience of telephone users. The telephone business exclusively operated by the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company should be acquired and managed by our country's government to expand the telephone's use area and receive the benefits of universal coverage. Furthermore, since the company is selling, your Bureau will definitely assist it in order to respect our country's sovereignty and transfer the exclusive approval rights of telephones in the concession to our country's government. We should send a letter to your Bureau for inspection and show your intention to assist, etc. Subsequently, two telegrams from the Ministry of Communications of Mayang were received and immediately replied, opening Nanjing Ministry of Communications Junbu Mayang's two telegrams were received, and most of them were for the purpose of national sovereignty integrity and taking into account the welfare of merchants and people to recover the rental phone. We are grateful for the efforts and assistance, and we will do our best to assist. We think that on the one hand, the approval right of the rental telephone should be declared to be recovered by the Ministry, and on the other hand, the detailed method of preparing the price to buy should be announced, so that the new company will not dare to easily undertake, and the Chinese and foreign shareholders of Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone will also know that the equity is guaranteed and the capital will not be lost. We must agree that users are more willing to see it succeed because they know that the future business price only seeks to maintain the prosperity of the business and the interests of the merchants. We should state the case and respectfully report it, etc. Furthermore, on June 25, the Shanghai Merchants Group Organizing Committee jointly announced in the newspaper the Chinese shareholders of Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company to open an announcement. It is announced that the Shanghai Special District (i.e. the Public Concession and the French Concession), which is exclusively operated by the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, is now determined by the National Government's Ministry of Communications to recover the concession for the integrity of our country's sovereignty and the implementation of national laws, and the company's property will be acquired at a price. It is hereby announced that all Chinese shareholders of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company will not attend the shareholders' meeting convened on the 27th of this month to show their support for national sovereignty and laws. I hope you will understand, etc. Furthermore, a training order from the Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was also submitted, opening respectfully the No. 10 training order of June 26 regarding the telephone issue in the concession. It was received and, in addition to having already announced in the newspaper on the 26th of this month, Chinese shareholders will not attend today's special shareholders' meeting of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company and will first support the Ministry of Communications' proposal. The corresponding letter is hereby returned for your inspection, etc. The matter concerns national sovereignty and the interests of users, so we should actively fight for it. Fortunately, the Telephone Users Association has been specialized to take charge of it. Our association will be more easily assisted to observe its success and achieve the final goal. The corresponding letter is hereby returned for your inspection and compliance.</p>

<h3>Letter Requesting Attention to Rural Sanitation</h3>
<p>Letter from the County Consolidation Committee to the County Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee sent a letter to the County Government yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the Sixth District Party Consolidation Committee has submitted a report stating that the Third Branch of the District has submitted a report requesting forwarding of a matter. As the summer season is approaching, epidemics are spreading, especially in rural areas, where people are more likely to contract diseases and treatment is difficult, which is even more dangerous. If measures are not taken to prevent this in advance, the future of the people's lives will be greatly affected. For example, the municipal health bureaus in neighboring areas of our county have recently paid close attention to the health of citizens (such as administering vaccinations and establishing public epidemic hospitals). However, the four borders of our county are all rural areas, and the villagers usually do not pay much attention to hygiene. At this time of extreme heat, it is inevitable that epidemics will spread. We have not heard of the government taking any measures to prevent or relieve this, which is contrary to the purpose of 'seeking benefits for the people.' In view of this, the Executive Committee decided at its second meeting to submit a report to your committee, which will forward it to the County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee, requesting the County Government to promptly pay attention to rural sanitation and to effectively organize vaccinations and establish temporary epidemic hospitals, etc. We hereby submit this document requesting approval and forwarding to emphasize the importance of the people's lives. We would be immensely grateful for your assistance." Therefore, the committee resolved at its thirty-first meeting to forward the matter as requested. We hereby send this letter to your esteemed government and request that you take note and handle it accordingly.</p>

<h3>Letter to Workers from the Preparatory Committee of the Tianzhang Paper Factory Union</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Tianzhang Paper Factory Union writes to all workers: Dear workers, our Tianzhang Paper Factory Union has received an order from the Municipal Party Department to begin preparations. In the future, we must take on the important mission of liberating the workers of our factory and work hard continuously. The President of our Party clearly tells us that it is not the Chinese capitalists who oppress the workers, because the Chinese capitalists are also an oppressed class. China is a country with backward production, and its industry cannot be revitalized, suffering from the economic aggression of the great powers. We deeply know that developing industry is China's only attempt at present. Therefore, now we must help the capitalists to vigorously expand production to resist imperialist economic aggression, and at the same time, we must promote the capitalists to protect the lives of the workers and improve the treatment of the workers, and implement the principle of mutual benefit in spirit and material, and eliminate the tragedy of labor-capital struggle. The Communist bandits who kill and set fires lead the often revolutionary and hardworking workers to their deaths one by one. Now everyone is awake and will no longer be used by them. Their lives are at the last moment. At the same time, the hardworking workers recognize that the Chinese Kuomintang is indeed seeking liberation and fighting for freedom for the hardworking workers. Therefore, the workers of our Tianzhang Paper Factory, in addition to gathering under the guidance of the Chinese Kuomintang to seek livelihood security and improve treatment conditions, should also take on the responsibility to eliminate the Communist Party who deceive workers and kill people without blinking an eye. Dear workers, organize tightly! Strengthen unity! Let us painstakingly build a bright paradise. 19.7.19</p>
<h3>Unsettled Issues of the Postal Workers' Union</h3>

They have been discussed with the authorities for a long time for nearly a year, but no satisfactory reply has been received. Now, because the one-year term of the seventh Executive and Supervisory Committee is about to expire, representatives have been sent continuously and a general request has been submitted to the authorities to negotiate and limit the satisfactory resolution of all outstanding cases within five days. The attitude is quite firm, and it is also heard that the Shanghai Postal Workers' Association urgently demands the subsidy for the high price of gold and the low price of silver before the other requirements of the union, and also takes consistent steps with the union.</p>

The following are the details of the news obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Establishment of a Funeral Committee: Yesterday morning, the cadres and staff of the bureau convened a meeting to discuss the organization of Zhao Tieqiao's funeral committee. The Party Committee appointed Wang Ziqian, Chief of the Affairs Section, as the director of the funeral committee, which was divided into four groups: General Affairs, Documentation, Social Affairs, and Accounting.

This notice.</p>
<p>Autopsy Yesterday: Zhao Tieqiao's remains were sent to the autopsy room on Flandre Road by a police car dispatched by the police station in charge on the night of the 24th. Yesterday morning (25th), the police station ordered Detective Mao Yiweng to summon Mrs. Huang, Zhao's wife, and bodyguard Liu Hua to the autopsy room. At 9:30 AM, Guo Huaipu, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, led the clerk, forensic doctor, and bailiff to the site. They first entered the morgue to examine the body's injuries in detail and fill out the autopsy form. Then, they ascended to the public seat, and the Western police chief and Chinese and Western detectives reported the circumstances of the incident and the investigation in detail. However, the details described were generally the same as those reported in the newspapers, so there is no need to repeat them. Then, according to Liu Hua's testimony, he was 25 years old, a native of Shandong, and served as Zhao's bodyguard. Yesterday morning, he accompanied Zhao in a car from his residence to the front of the China Merchants Bureau. He got out of the car to open the car door, and Zhao also got out of the car. At this time, he suddenly saw a thug open fire at him. He heard the sound and pretended to fall to the ground. The thug then shot Zhao twice. Zhao, injured, ran into the bureau. The thug then fled. He had no weapons and could not resist, so he only blew the police whistle wildly. According to Zhao's driver, Shen A'san, he lived at No. 168 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, and had been Zhao's driver for many years. Yesterday morning, he drove to the front of the China Merchants Bureau and stopped. Suddenly, a person wearing a white rayon short shirt and black trousers, whose shirt was longer than ordinary short shirts, so that the pistol inserted in his waistband was not exposed. When Zhao got out of the car, the person suddenly pulled out a pistol from his waistband and opened fire. When I saw this, I was filled with anger and wanted to get out of the car to protect him, but I had no weapons and could not do anything. Finally, Mrs. Huang, Zhao's wife, requested that the murderers be arrested and justice be done. The woman was 37 years old and had been in extreme grief since the tragedy occurred. It is said that her husband, Zhao Tieqiao, was from Sichuan and was 43 years old. Yesterday morning, she and her husband were in the car when the tragedy occurred. She was sitting in the car and witnessed a person with a bulging abdomen, who she suspected was a lurking assassin. As her husband was getting out of the car, he was attacked. Mrs. Huang then sobbed and could not continue speaking, covering her face and crying as she retreated. Finally, the watchman of the bureau, No. 1626, testified that he first heard the sound of gunfire and thought it was a car tire bursting. Then he heard the sound of a police whistle and realized that something had happened. At this time, Zhao had already walked into the bureau. He went outside, but the murderer had already fled by rickshaw. After the prosecutor Guo finished questioning, he ordered the wife of the deceased, Zhao Huang, to sign a statement to claim the body for encoffining, and ordered the police to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice for punishment.</p>
<p>The Encoffining Ceremony is Set for Tomorrow: After Zhao Tieqiao died in the hospital, his body was sent to the Universal Funeral Home at No. 71 Jiaozhou Road by car. The funeral committee has discussed with Zhao's family and decided to hold the encoffining ceremony at the Universal Funeral Home at 4:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. It has also been decided that the funeral will be held at 7:00 AM on August 3. Handling of Bureau Affairs: After Zhao's assassination, the bureau's cadre meeting discussed the follow-up arrangements for the China Merchants Bureau and decided on the following: (1) Internal affairs will be handled as usual. (2) External affairs, all urgent and daily matters will be handled by the leaders of each section and department, using the name of the section and department or the general management office in official letters. (3) Other major events and matters that must be signed and issued in the name of the general manager will be postponed.</p>
<p>Sub-Bureaus Lower Flags: Yesterday, the funeral committee sent a telegram to the sub-bureaus and merchant ships in various ports, ordering them to lower their flags to half-mast for three days as a sign of mourning.</p>
<h3>Liu Nianchun Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Because He Was Previously Kidnapped</p>
<p>Released After Being Identified by the Bandits</p>
<p>Liu Nianchun, director of the Shanghai Gold Exchange and owner of Dingkang Gold Shop, a native of Suzhou, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits for the second time on the 5th of this month and disappeared. This case has been reported in this newspaper. According to news from the gold industry, Liu has safely arrived home three days ago. According to Liu, the reason for his release was that after being kidnapped, he was with the bandits in a very remote countryside, far from Shanghai. He had never been there before, so he did not know the name of the place. He repeatedly stated to the bandits that he had been kidnapped before, and the bandits agreed to investigate. If it was true, they would never ask for money again. Then, day after day, all food and drink were quite preferential, but there was no news. Until the night of his release, the bandits claimed that they had confirmed that he had been kidnapped before, and then released him to return home. It is also heard that Liu went to Suzhou a few days ago to travel.</p>
<h3>Water Police Kidnapping Case: Two Gang Members Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Buyun, the village chief of Dingxing Sand and Yawo Sand (also known as Shitou Sand) outside Wusongkou, and five other villagers were kidnapped by water police from the 17th team of the Fourth District Water Police in collusion with five people who looked like soldiers. Five people were kidnapped. This has been reported in this newspaper. It is learned that Ding Sand and Ruifeng Sand are only separated by a narrow strip of water. Because the area is located at a strategic point on the coast, the 17th team of the Fourth District Water Police stationed seven patrol boat officers led by Police Officer Huang Yutang to protect the shipping. At the time of the incident, five people wearing Western clothes came from the direction of Haimen to visit Chen Guoliang (previously mistakenly reported as Patrol Officer Zhang) of the patrol boat team. After talking briefly, they accompanied team members Zhang Liujin and Wang Youcai and the visitors out the door. Before leaving, Chen and others forcibly took away the guns of the four police officers, Gong Xibao, Zhou Chongquan, Peng Jie, and Wang Nengcai. They then went to the river and hired a civilian boat, first going to Dingxing Sand across the river and kidnapping Wang Buyun and his son, the village chief of the area. Then, they went to Yawo Sand and kidnapped Shi Yongshun and three other villagers from the area. They immediately set sail and sailed away. After the incident, the public groups of the villagers of Dingxing and Yawo Sands suspected that Chen and others were water police and went to Ruifeng Sand to find Police Officer Huang Yutang and others who had not fled. They suspected that the water police were involved in the case and immediately detained the five officers, including Huang Yutang, and sent them to the Baoshan County Government. At the same time, they reported to the 17th Team of the Water Police. Commander Gong Mianqin was ordered by the provincial government to suppress bandits on the Chongqi waters. Upon receiving the police report, he immediately telegraphed his subordinates, Zhu Fukuan, the captain of the first squad, and Fei Hanlin, the captain of the second squad, to lead their teams to search by boat. Until the night before last, they learned that gang members related to the case were hiding in Donggangkou outside the sea. They immediately went to encircle them yesterday morning and found a sailboat moored there. They arrested two bandits on the spot. After interrogation, one surnamed Zhang and one surnamed Jiang both confessed that they had colluded with Chen Guoliang and others to kidnap Wang Buyun and others without denying it. The prior plan was all directed by Chen. Chen and others and Wang Xianpiao are now unknown. After the two criminals were captured, they were escorted to the Fourth District Office of the Wusong Water Police for interrogation at 10:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Fell Yesterday</h3>
<p>In recent days, since the news of Yu Qiaqing and others initiating the purchase of a large batch of rice spread, the price of rice in Shanghai has gradually declined. Yesterday, the selling price of rice in the north and south markets suddenly plummeted. The highest grade of white japonica rice was 20 yuan per picul, 18 yuan and 10 cents, and 17 yuan and 50 cents. Thin paddy was 20 yuan per picul, top Saigon was 15 yuan and 10 cents, number two Saigon was 12 yuan and 20 cents, and small broken rice was 13 yuan and 10 cents. Compared with the day before, the general decline was more than one yuan. The retail prices of rice in various rice shops on various roads also decreased. Due to the continuous decline, the losses have been great. It is heard that a certain rice shop in the South Market has lost more than 100,000 yuan this time. According to people in the industry, the rice fields in various rural areas are growing well due to favorable weather, and the harvest in the future will be abundant and certain. The new rice from Hunan Province has been harvested in sufficient quantity, and the market price is only 7 yuan per picul. It will soon arrive in Shanghai, so it is expected that the price of rice in Shanghai will continue to decline.</p>
<h3>Female Student Wang Yunfang Flees</h3>
<p>Saw Her Fiancé Walking with Another Woman</p>
<p>Believed There Was an Improper Relationship</p>
<p>Sent a Letter to Question Him and Terminate the Engagement</p>
<p>Left Home Without Achieving Her Goal</p>
<p>Wang Linqiu, a 46-year-old villager in Wangjiaqiao Village, Hongqiao Town, west of Shanghai, is of modest means. His wife, Liu, has one son and two daughters. The eldest daughter, Yunqing, is 26 years old and currently works at the telegraph bureau. The younger daughter, Yunfen, is 22 years old and unmarried. She has received secondary education. Last year, Linqiu invested in establishing a Wang's primary school at home and appointed Yunfen to handle the teaching affairs, which was well managed. Therefore, there are 70 students from nearby areas, and the villagers praised her. The second daughter, Yunfang, is only 19 years old and is currently studying at a certain girls' middle school. Last autumn, she was engaged to Gu Wenda, a local man, through a matchmaker. She had obtained Yunfang's consent. Gu is currently 22 years old and works in a certain agency. It was scheduled to be married this winter. On the 2nd of this month, Yunfang was on her way home from school when she suddenly encountered her fiancé, Gu Wenda, walking hand in hand with another woman in Chengjiaqiao, Hongqiao Road. Yunfang believed that Gu had an improper relationship with the woman. After investigating, she learned that Gu had secretly agreed to marry a Zhang woman from Songjiang. Yunfang believed that her future lifelong happiness was lost and asked her parents to terminate the engagement. She sent a letter to Gu, questioning him severely and denying the validity of the engagement. Gu was furious after receiving the letter and rushed to Wang's house to negotiate, vowing that he would not terminate the engagement. However, Yunfang was under the oppression of her old family, and her father opposed it, rebuking her and encouraging her to be faithful to one man. Yunfang was extremely frustrated at this point and suddenly left home alone the day before yesterday (21st), leaving a letter (the wording is omitted). Later, her family noticed it and had no idea where she had gone. They entrusted someone to search for her everywhere, but there was no news. The whole family was very panicked. They have now told the matchmaker and are preparing to terminate the engagement with Gu and search for her, and they have reported to the Water Patrol Team and the Rescue Bureau to pay attention to her whereabouts.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Crack Down on Gambling Den</h3>
<p>Fines of 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Detectives Xu Fuqing, Li Yousheng, Li Liansheng, and Bao Detective Liu Kunbao of the French Police Force, discovered some days ago that a private gambling establishment, a large "flower club" (gambling den), was secretly operating in a bungalow at a certain address in Wender Lane on Rue Luber. They dispatched individuals to set up listening devices and lure people into gambling, defrauding them of their money, which was against regulations. They reported this to the Western Detective, who accompanied them to raid the place. They confiscated one copper "flower club" plaque, gambling records, and silver dollars, along with over fifty gamblers and the ringleader, Qiu Guirong, all of whom were taken to the police station. The police chief ordered the gamblers to be lightly fined and dismissed, while Qiu was detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the French court for investigation. First, the Western Detective Chief, Sacyre, reported that the "flower club" headquarters established by the defendant was different from ordinary listening posts, specifically designed to swindle the money of foolish men and women, and was indeed harmful to society. Moreover, in the past year, there had been three assassination cases in the British Concession due to flower club gambling. According to the law, a fine of more than 3,000 yuan should be imposed. The defendant, Qiu Guirong, confessed without dispute to privately establishing the flower club headquarters. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Qiu to a fine of 1,500 yuan to serve as a warning. The confiscated gambling equipment and silver dollars were also confiscated.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Concerned About Public Safety</h3>
<p>Attention to Equipment in National Products Department Stores</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department received a report that the China National Products Department Store, located at the original site of the Nanjing Road Municipal Hall, was rushed in its preparation, resulting in incomplete fire prevention and sanitation equipment inside the department store and the Tongle Amusement Park. In addition, there were numerous electric lights with improperly installed wiring. The adjacent area was full of large shops, creating a dangerous situation for public safety and order. Yesterday, the Old Zhabei Police Station dispatched detectives to investigate and sent two letters of warning, ordering all equipment to be fully installed before July 30 to avoid danger. They also ordered the immediate removal of the added gasoline lamps to ensure safety. The department store has been ordered to quickly find ways to remedy the situation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Approves Fare Increases for Public and Long-Distance Buses</h3>
<p>Gold prices have soared and everything has become expensive, especially foreign goods. All public and long-distance bus companies in the city, except for the Shangnan Long-Distance Bus, which uses steam power, and the Shangchuan Long-Distance Bus, which uses diesel fuel and is less affected, the other leased Humin, Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Lines, the Jiaotong Company, the Hutai Long-Distance Bus Company, and the Huashang Hunan Two Public Bus Companies, all faced significant losses due to the price of gasoline rising from a few cents per gallon to over one yuan. They successively petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for permission to appropriately increase fares to compensate. The bureau investigated the actual business conditions of each company and found that since the increase in gasoline prices, each company had increased its monthly expenses by several thousand yuan for some and several hundred yuan for others, making it genuinely difficult to sustain operations. Therefore, based on the proportion of gasoline price increases and the number of passengers, the estimated fare increases for each company were submitted to the municipal government for separate approval. The Jiaotong Company was allowed to add four cents per ticket, Huashang Public Bus was allowed to add two cents per ticket, and Hunan Public Bus was also allowed to add two cents per ticket. For Route 2, the preferential fare for military personnel and workers was increased by one cent per ticket. However, the original fares will be restored as soon as gasoline prices stabilize slightly. The issue of fare increases for the Hutai Long-Distance Bus Company has reportedly also been discussed by the Bureau of Public Utilities and is currently under review by the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Driver Sentenced to One and a Half Years for Causing an Accident While Joyriding</h3>
<p>Zuixiangge Laoqi Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Wang Chunfu, a Ningbo native and driver for the Zhengjiamu Bridge Lanji Automobile Company, was driving car number 12577 on the night of the ninth of this month, carrying prostitutes Zuixiangge Laoqi, Xiaomeimei, Lou Jinhua Laoqi, and patrons Ying Guisheng and Wei Sannan for a joyride to Beixinjing. The car was driven carelessly, overturning and injuring the passengers. Three prostitutes died, with only Zuixiangge Laoqi and two patrons surviving. Wang himself was also injured. Afterward, the police charged Wang Chunfu with causing death due to negligence in the Special District Local Court. Previous details were recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, the trial continued, and Zuixiangge Laoqi was summoned to testify. She stated that she was 19 years old, currently working as a prostitute in Minheli. The deceased Xiaomeimei was her sister. That night, Wei Sannan called for a "Tangchai" (messenger boy), and they went to the Tiannan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. Later, Wei wanted to go for a joyride and invited them to ride in a car together. While driving to Beixinjing, the car crashed into a tree on the side of the road to avoid another vehicle, overturning. All five people in the car were thrown out. She injured her left arm and has since recovered. Ying and Wei also described the circumstances of the accident at the time, saying that their injuries had not yet fully healed. Since the defendant's confession had already been taken, the defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, and the police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented their arguments in succession. Judge Wu immediately pronounced the sentence, sentencing Wang Chunfu to one year and six months of imprisonment. The number of days detained before the sentence was confirmed would be deducted at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. After the sentence, the police took Wang back to the police station to await execution after confirmation.</p>
<h3>Actress Wang Meixia Unwilling to Marry Jin Jitan</h3>
<p>Requests Dissolution of Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Actress Wang Meixia, from the Wuwangtai area, is nineteen years old. She was previously with the actor Jin Jitan at the Xiaoshijie Amusement Park in the city. Wang's talent and artistry are remarkable, admired by critics and fellow performers alike. Jin Ling was particularly infatuated and wanted to marry her. Therefore, he showed great diligence to Wang's mother and tried his best to please her. However, Wang found Jin Ling frivolous and was unwilling to entrust her life to him. During the abolished lunar calendar in May of last year, Wang's mother, seduced by Jin, secretly arranged the marriage without seeking Meixia's consent. On the 20th of that month, which was also the auspicious date for Meixia's brother's engagement, she accepted a betrothal gift of 150 yuan borrowed by Wang's mother. When Meixia found out, she strongly opposed it and fought to the death. Her parents, knowing that they could not force her, asked the original matchmaker, Zhou Shangxu, to consult with Jin to dissolve the marriage contract, but Jin refused. In March of this year, Meixia hired a lawyer to send a letter to Jin Ling, declaring the marriage contract invalid. Jin ignored it. Jin's mother hired a lawyer to reply, saying that Jin had gone to Jinan to perform and that the matter could only be dealt with after he returned. Meiling, unwilling to wait any longer, not only published a statement in the newspaper but also filed a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court to dissolve the marriage contract. Yesterday morning, the plaintiff and her lawyer, Tao Jiachun, appeared in court, while the defendant was absent. His mother requested a postponement and submitted a theater schedule showing Jin performing in Jinan. Judge Yang, finding it credible, granted a postponement of the trial date.</p>
<h3>Record of a Woman from Huzhou Being Abducted</h3>
<p>Min Yangshi Encountered Violence Midway</p>
<p>Luo Meiting's Words Were Evasive</p>
<p>Min Youren, a twenty-four-year-old villager, and his twenty-one-year-old wife, Yangshi, lived outside the East Gate of Huzhou. The couple lived by farming, and their relationship was considered harmonious. On the twenty-first of this month, Ms. Min went to her mother's home in the city on business. On the way, she was suddenly stopped by Luo Meiting, a rogue from Zhoushan, who blocked her path and made lewd remarks. Ms. Min ignored him and was forcibly restrained and threatened to go to Shanghai with him. If she refused, there would be dire consequences. Ms. Min felt alone and helpless, unable to call for help. Fearing that resistance would lead to violence, she reluctantly went along. After arriving at the pier, she was forced to board a steamer to Shanghai. On the day before yesterday, she was forced to change ships again to go to Zhoushan. Unexpectedly, after boarding the ship, she encountered Yang Guilin, a fellow villager she knew, who also happened to be on the ship. Yang asked her what was the reason for going to Zhoushan. At this point, she felt ashamed and had difficulty speaking. Yang, seeing this, suspected something was amiss. He guessed that their journey was not for good purposes and took both of them to the shore and kept watch. He then telegraphed her husband, Min Youren, to come to Shanghai. Min, who had been searching everywhere for his missing wife in great anxiety, was overjoyed to receive the telegram and immediately rushed to meet her. After questioning her, he learned the full story and was filled with anger. Yesterday afternoon, at around 5:00 PM, he brought Luo to the Nanshi First District Police Station, requesting a thorough investigation. After being brought in for preliminary interrogation, Min and his wife both recounted the events. Ms. Min stated that she had been forced by the man to board a ship in Huzhou and taken to Shanghai, where she was raped. He now intended to sell her to Zhoushan. Luo's testimony was confused and evasive. They were ordered to be temporarily detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Feng Caizhen Sues for Divorce Due to Abuse</h3>
<p>Feng Caizhen (also known as Cai Fengshi), a woman from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, is currently twenty-six years old and resides in Minhang Town. She has filed a lawsuit in the Local Court for divorce through lawyer Wu Luping because she cannot bear to live with her husband, Cai Fulin, due to his arbitrary abuse. The lawsuit states that the plaintiff married the defendant at the age of twenty-one, hoping for mutual respect and a lifelong partnership. However, the defendant does not engage in legitimate business, indulges in smoking and gambling, and wanders away from home for months at a time. He constantly asks the plaintiff for money for his extravagant spending. When cash is insufficient, he takes her clothes and jewelry. Over the years, everything has been pawned. If he is slightly displeased, he whips her. The husband's behavior is so bad that he even lives with his lover in Shanghai, rarely staying at home. His parents pretend to be deaf and blind, not caring about the family situation. The plaintiff's family situation is heartbreaking. The plaintiff has had no food for days, and the defendant does not care. Her family originally ran a bathhouse and a coal store (both in Minhang Town), but due to the defendant's private collection and misuse of funds, the business was in financial trouble and closed down at the end of last year. The bathhouse was sold. Since then, their livelihood has been on the verge of collapse. The future is long, and she is helpless. The plaintiff has endured hardship and has been reluctant to seek a divorce lightly, but she has been forced by circumstances and can no longer bear it. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting a divorce and requesting the recovery of gold jewelry, clothing, and borrowed funds. Yesterday morning, Court President Guo Shouyi specially opened the Sixth Court for the trial. The plaintiff, Feng Caizhen, briefly stated the above and said that she currently lives with her mother in the old west street of Minhang because she has little food and clothing. She requested a divorce and the recovery of clothes and silver dollars, totaling 297 yuan. The defendant, Cai Fulin, age 25, from Songjiang, residing in Minhang Town, stated that he had not abused the plaintiff. The judge suggested a reconciliation in court, ordering the plaintiff not to divorce and the defendant not to abuse her in the future. However, the plaintiff insisted on a divorce. The judge asked, "Then how much will you compensate the defendant so that he can remarry?" But the plaintiff said that she had no money, adding, "My money was used by him for smoking and gambling. He also borrowed 50 yuan from my sister, which has not been repaid." The judge questioned the defendant, who claimed that he had not borrowed money. The judge said, "If she doesn't want to be with you, there is nothing you can do. Husband and wife must be willing to live together. How about he compensate you a bit?" He replied, "I have been raised in her family since I was eight years old, and it has been ten years. Even for the food expenses, I should be compensated. Moreover, when I married her, various expenses amounted to thousands of yuan. If she insists on a divorce, she must repay the full amount." The judge said, "If you want to calculate his food expenses, then he should also be paid for working in your family for ten years." The judge tried to persuade them for a long time, but they did not reach an agreement. Therefore, he invited Prosecutor Zhao to come to the court to express his opinion. The judge then announced the end of the debate and set the verdict for the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Xiao Jinhua's Gold Bracelet and Gen Di's Chastity Issue</h3>
<p>One Sues for Unreturned Borrowed Gold Bracelet</p>
<p>One Countersues for Rape of Gen Di</p>
<p>Hu Ge, also known as Xiao Jinhua, a singer of Ningbo folk songs, residing at 200 Maojia Lane, sued in the Local Court that Fu Gushi, a Ningbo woman, and her daughter, Fu Gendi, had borrowed a gold bracelet from her but had not returned it, but had instead pawned it. The pawn ticket was returned in an attempt to deceive, which was akin to embezzlement and fraud. After the court accepted the case, it ordered both parties to be questioned. Fu Gushi did not appear, and her lawyer submitted a statement arguing that the client could not appear due to illness. However, in this case, her daughter, Gendi, is only fourteen years old and not fully developed. She and Xiao Jinhua both sang folk songs. On the night of April 14th, after the show ended at 11:00 PM, Xiao Jinhua invited Gendi to stay at her house. Unexpectedly, at 12:00 AM, her husband, Hu Jusheng, returned home, and Gendi moved to sleep on the floor. Half an hour later, Hu Jusheng suddenly became lustful, got out of bed, and, without asking, forcibly raped her. Xiao Jinhua helped cover her mouth. Afterward, to cover up the matter, they bought a small gold bracelet to deceive her into not saying anything. Gendi returned home and lied to her mother that she had borrowed it. Her mother ordered her to return it, so Gendi secretly pawned it and gave the pawn ticket to Shen Chunlin, Hu Jusheng's teacher. Now, she is countersuing for rape. The court then rescheduled the hearing for the 28th of this month. After the court adjourned, Fu Gushi reported the rape to the prosecutor's office. Xiao Jinhua was summoned to court for preliminary interrogation and ordered to post bail. Hu Jusheng was ordered to appear in court quickly for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Divorce Agreement During Agreed Divorce, Escape</h3>
<p>Chen Rufa's Intentions Were Unscrupulous</p>
<p>Mediator's Righteous Act</p>
<p>Liu Zhangshi's daughter, Liu Suzhen, aged eighteen, resides in Baoying, 18 Jian Kai Ping Bureau, Pudong. She married Chen Rufa, a native of Yancheng, last year. Chen is twenty-two years old this year. It turns out that the marriage was not harmonious and was like that of enemies, with frequent beatings and quarrels. Suzhen was not accustomed to the abuse and fled some days ago, and her mother sent her to work in a factory in Puxi. Chen learned of this and entrusted his fellow villagers Qian Jincheng, Wang Jinlong, Qian Xuechang, and others to negotiate with Liu Zhangshi, saying that their relationship was indeed broken and he was willing to divorce, but the marriage gifts had to be returned. It was agreed that 70 yuan would be returned. Liu Zhangshi pawned items to raise the money. They wrote a divorce agreement and paid the money for separation at Fuxing Teahouse in Yangjing, and Chen was ordered to invite his maternal uncle Xu Wenli to be present. After signing, Chen Rufa, Xu Wenli, and others grabbed the silver and the divorce agreement and fled. Liu Zhangshi was greatly shocked, and Qian Jincheng and others, being mediators, witnessed this situation and were very displeased. They helped the woman to apprehend Chen and Xu and handed them over to the Second Sub-district of the Third District Police Station for investigation and handling at the Local Court.</p>
<h3>Problems Arise in Ye Fengsheng's Marriage</h3>
<p>Ye Fengsheng, a 21-year-old from Huangyan, works at a money exchange and is highly valued by his manager for his prudence. He is in charge of silver dollars. However, his parents died early, and he is not yet married. Last year, his grandmother arranged a marriage with a Zhang woman from the same village. Unexpectedly, Fengsheng learned that his fiancée was an ordinary-looking village girl, so he wrote to his grandmother asking her to cancel the marriage. Since then, his attitude has suddenly changed. He frequently goes to amusement parks in the evening. Recently, he received a letter from his grandmother stating that she has chosen an auspicious day in September of the lunar calendar for the wedding and another letter from Fengsheng's uncle, asking him to persuade him to stay the course. He told Fengsheng that the countryside is not like Shanghai and that it is difficult to break off a marriage and sent a photo of the Zhang girl. Unexpectedly, Fengsheng firmly refused. Last week, he handed over his duties and falsely claimed that he was returning home to visit his uncle, without asking for leave. He only said that his life's happiness was hopeless and that he would rather die early. He was repeatedly comforted and told that if things did not work out, he could take a concubine. Fengsheng said nothing and left. Yesterday, Feng's uncle came to the exchange and learned that Fengsheng had left without saying goodbye.

<h3>Temples Set Up in Rented Houses Must Be Closed by the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Director Yuan yesterday issued a public notice stating that the case of registering temples had been investigated by this bureau. According to reports from various districts, there are many temples in this city that are set up in rented houses and have only abbots but no religious buildings. These temples do not comply with Article 1 of the Temple Registration Regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and cannot be registered in the same way as other formal temples. Moreover, this city is prosperous and bustling, and it is not a place for pure cultivation. It is difficult to ensure that there is no abuse of soliciting money. Unless strictly prohibited, it is not enough to change the decline in customs. Therefore, the bureau has decided that all temples established in rented houses that have already been established will be temporarily allowed to exist, but no more temples will be allowed to be established in the future, and no relocation will be allowed. All must be closed by the end of this year. After being submitted to the municipal government for approval, it will be handled accordingly. In addition to issuing orders to each district to comply with and handle it, it is hereby announced that all abbots of temples established in rented houses in this city must be fully informed.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake Industry Discusses Dalian Cake Measures</h3>
<p>The oil cake industry associations gathered at the Cuixiu Hall in Yimiao yesterday to discuss the issue of Dalian border cakes being underweight, discounted, and sold in Shanghai, which violated the association's rules and regulations. It was generally said that last year, the Dalian border cakes were transported to Shanghai for sale. After the industry sold them, they were suddenly returned from various inland ports. After the industry collectively weighed them, they found that the amount was reduced and the quality was not firm, causing great losses to the industry. The association had contacted various manufacturers in Dalian but was ignored. Therefore, the association decided to establish rules and regulations to take measures to deal with the matter and informed the manufacturers in Dalian not to damage the regulations again. However, the Dalian cakes transported this year are even more underweight than before, intentionally damaging the regulations. There are a large number of Dalian cakes purchased by existing merchants in Shanghai that have not yet been shipped from the foreign warehouses, so methods are being discussed because the weight has been reduced. After the discussion, the cakes that have been purchased by the industry must be weighed by piece. If the weight is insufficient, the seller will be contacted. In the future, the cakes transported should be inspected for quality and weight first. If they are qualified, the industry can purchase them. The inspection should also be carefully carried out when delivering the goods to avoid further losses. At the same time, manufacturers and commercial guests stationed in Shanghai in Dalian will be notified of this, and the meeting situation will be notified to the industry.</p>

<p>Notice: In yesterday's newspaper, it was reported that the American Nie Geding would perform magic at the Bund on Nanjing Road at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 25th), but Nie Geding did not go there at that time, causing the readers to wait there for a long time. We are very sorry. According to the Summer Pack Theater, which sent this news, Nie Geding was determined to perform as scheduled, but it is unknown why the sudden change occurred. We hereby clarify the ins and outs, hoping for your understanding.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Respected Editor: I read the 21st issue of your newspaper's local news section, which stated that the home of Kang Tinggui in Guanhang Village, Huxiang Township, Shanghai South Gate was suddenly robbed, injuring the victim, etc. After checking, Guanhang Town is within our district, and our district office is responsible for local security. We dispatched personnel to the town to investigate in detail, and there was no such incident. The town office also said that there was no robbery, and there was no Kang Tinggui in the household register. It is obvious that someone is spreading rumors and confusing the audience. Now is the time of military affairs in the front, and I am afraid that unscrupulous people are spreading rumors. I am writing this special letter to ask your newspaper to make a factual correction. Respectfully, the Third District Office of Shanghai County.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Recently, the person concerned, Zhou Jianren, claimed that he recently read the Shanghai local news column in your newspaper and published a section on "Qu and Zhou Dispute Over Ancestry," and the content contained many errors, which may be due to inaccurate interviews by your reporter. I am especially here to correct the items as follows: (1) Zhou Junxi's household name No. 189 Fangdan is one mu, seven fen, nine li, and nine hao, while the two fake contracts submitted by the Qu family are two mu, five fen, four li, and nine hao. (2) Zhou Juping's lawsuit with the Qu surname in Japan was not a dispute over ancestral graves, because Juping had entrusted Qu to take care of the tomb base, and Qu took advantage of Juping's far away to steal and transfer the ownership. After Juping returned to Shanghai, disputes arose. (3) When Zhou Jianren sold the land this spring, he did not inform the Qu surname, but the guarantor Yu Bingshen said that the Qu surname came forward to interfere, and Zhang Shousan, a relative, mediated the dispute and did not agree to compensate 6,200 yuan. The Qu surname also did not submit Fangdan. Please immediately publish the above points in the "Letters to the Editor" column to make corrections. Accordingly, I am hereby writing this letter to check and take care of it. Respectfully, Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao Newspaper, Lawyer, July 25th.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Major General Li Tieqing Qiu Yi</h3>
<p>Scholars of the new learning school warn against superstition, but I am the most superstitious person. I also speak a little bit of the new learning. At first, I was not very superstitious. In the early years of the Republic of China, I met Major General Li Tieqing at Wuchang. Li Huangpi was sitting there. Tieqing was the commander-in-chief of the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Hunan for suppressing bandits. He came to see Huangpi about official business. Huangpi said, "I can't help but go north due to Yuan Gong's urging. Do you think I will have any accidents?" Tieqing said, "There will be no harm in going. You are truly blessed. Others created the opportunity, and you get it. Your honor and wealth are better than Xiangcheng's." Huangpi smiled and nodded. Five years later, Huangpi succeeded Xiangcheng as the Vice President and took over the political power. Yi Shifu, a talented scholar from Longyang, Hunan, said, "I met this gentleman in Zhang Wenxiang's official residence. He told me, 'The Governor-General summoned me in the morning, and it is already 2:45 PM. I dare not leave. I am hungry. What should I do?'" At that time, Shifu and others were summoned by Wenxiang to write poetry clocks. After entering, the summons was even more uncertain. It was only at sunset that they came out. Huangpi was still sitting there. Shifu said, "Have you not left yet?" He instructed the officer to tell Wenxiang. Huangpi then entered to see him. Because of this, Huangpi quite appreciated Shifu. When he became president, Shifu said, "This gentleman is a gentleman, but he has no talent." He drafted a letter of resignation that said, "Yuan Hong is weak and has little ability. I dare not let the vacancy of one seat cause the people to suffer. Please ask the gentlemen of the parliament to elect someone who is wise and talented as president," etc. Li Tieqing was a fellow townsman of Shifu. When he heard this, he said to Shifu, "Whether you are president or not is probably destined. You can't get it by chance. If you think Huangpi can't be president, who do you think can be president? Only this gentleman can rise and fall quickly, and the president cannot last long. Why do you have to do this?" Shifu agreed, but he eventually sent the resignation draft to Huangpi. For a time, the capital was in an uproar, saying that Yi Shifu was crazy, but Shifu did not care. Tieqing said that Shifu was famous all over the world and was a descendant of a generation. It is a pity that good fortune and wisdom cannot be combined. He will die in the year Geng. Later, it really happened. I was already superstitious about Tieqing. At that time, I went to Tieqing's room to ask about my fate. All the troubles I had, such as the death of my parents, being robbed, and the breaking of my Kun string, were all talked about.</p>
<h3>Small Notes on Sichuan Land Xun An</h3>
<p>The climate in Sichuan is mild, and the land is fertile. Among them, the most famous natural product is opium paste, which is outstanding. The residents of Sichuan generally abandon their original fields and engage in planting poppy seedlings, which harm the people, in order to make huge profits. This causes the land's production capacity to fall into a very uneven state. As a result, the production of opium is constantly increasing, while the supply of people's food feels particularly reduced. Based on this situation, it can be inferred that Sichuan Province will naturally suffer from a shortage of rice and food, and it will have to import food from other provinces. However, the fact is not the case. The production of rice in Sichuan is very abundant and sufficient to meet the needs of the people, without the need for assistance from other provinces. The fertility of the land in Sichuan can be seen from this. However, the local people have failed to seek proper development of this natural resource, but have madly engaged in the opium business containing toxic agents, which can be described as the most violent waste of natural resources.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw in the newspaper that Tieqing has become famous at sea for his physiognomy skills. So I recorded his anecdotes.</p>
<h3>Remarks by an Old Friend from Hubei on the Red Silk of Jingzhou</h3>
<p>Novels and social education are greatly related. This saying is indeed true. Nowadays, everyone roughly knows the events of the Three Kingdoms period, even women and children can name the characters of Shu Han. They can distinguish who were the civil officials and who were the military generals, as if counting family treasures. This is all thanks to the popularity of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Furthermore, the heroes of the green forests and the outcasts of the lower classes who become bandits all aspire to be like the characters of Liangshan. This is due to the profound influence of the "Water Margin." Some say that the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" seems to be written for Guan Yu alone. In the book, everyone except the emperors are addressed by their given names, while Guan is addressed as "Lord" as evidence. Moreover, the book deliberately embellishes Guan Yu's deeds, using vivid and detailed descriptions as if the reader is seeing him in person. Later generations of readers thus respect Guan Yu to the utmost, deifying and sanctifying him. There have been many ministers in later generations whose achievements were like Guan Yu's, and Yue Fei of the Song Dynasty even surpassed him, yet his reputation is far less than Guan Yu's. This is because the biography of Yue Fei is inferior to the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." Therefore, isn't the magical power of novels to influence people's minds truly great? Since childhood, I have enjoyed talking about the Three Kingdoms, and I am particularly fond of hearing people describe the relics of the Three Kingdoms period, and I am always engrossed without tiring. Recently, I met an old friend from Hubei who told me that in Jingzhou city, in a corner of the old prefectural office, there is a stone horse trough, said to be used for feeding horses when Guan Yu guarded Jingzhou. It is about sixteen feet long, three feet wide, and only one and a half feet deep. The edges are carved with scrolling grass patterns, which are now blurred and difficult to distinguish. In the past, a servant in the prefectural office tried to feed a horse with the trough, but the horse suddenly neighed and refused to move forward. They tried with other horses, but the same thing happened. Therefore, they warned each other not to desecrate it. This matter is recorded in the local chronicles and should be credible. However, now the old prefectural office is dilapidated due to years of disrepair, and the horse trough is abandoned among the weeds, with no one caring for it, and no spiritual significance is attributed to it. Also, there is a Guan Di Temple in Jingzhou city, which is very old. The people of Jingzhou call it the Old Guan Di Temple. There are still several households of Guan Yu's descendants in the temple, similar to the descendants of Confucius in Qufu. However, their prosperity is far inferior to that of the Confucius lineage. They are all impoverished. Could it be that Heaven also discriminates, valuing literature and devaluing martial arts? However, I cannot help but have doubts. The "Records of the Three Kingdoms" states that Pang Hui, the son of Pang De, followed Deng Ai into Shu and exterminated the Guan family. If it is said that they were all exterminated, then where did the descendants come from? If the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" is not credible, then today's descendants must be imposters. If the descendants are not imposters, then the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" is not a reliable history. The two cannot both be true. Or, as some say, it is better to have no book than to believe everything in a book. Then, the claim that Pang Hui exterminated the Guan family is truly unbelievable.</p>
<h3>A Critique of the New "Searching for the Orphan" Record by Bei Kai as Being Too Expensive</h3>
<p>Last year, Tan Xiaopei, father and son, and Jin Shaoshan collaborated with Bei Kai</p>
<p>to record three "Catching and Releasing Cao" records, which were considered rare and well-received. Now, they have released two "Searching for the Orphan" records. I listened to them yesterday and found them even more satisfying than the three "Catching and Releasing Cao" records. Jin Shaoshan's narration as Tu Angu is excellent, lifelike, and vividly portrayed. The four sections of the Sanban aria have a clear and resonant tone, full of energy, and many melodious and pleasant phrases. Fu Ying's Cheng Ying and Xiao Pei's Chu Jiu each have a section of Daoban turning to Yuanban, as well as several sections of Sanban. Fu Ying's singing is extremely gentle and smooth, while Xiao Pei's singing is pure and flawless, naturally moving. It has been said that all modern old male singers raise the banner of the Tan school as a symbol of their style. However, those whose voices are clear, sweet, and close to old Tan's are all like Xiao Pei. If they were to record talking records,</p>
<p>it would be almost indistinguishable from Jiao Tian's singing in his prime. It is rumored that he often went to Chu Jiu in his youth. Now, Xiao Pei's performance in this record is perhaps like a brave warrior of the Imperial Guard, still resembling Fu Ying's family style in many ways and learning a lot from it. It is generally said that he has been working hard recently, hoping to achieve success. Comparing the previous and current records, it seems that the speed of his progress is also quite remarkable. The saying of tempering oneself can be verified. The record, from Tu Angu sitting in the hall to the execution ground, includes all the arias and narrations without omission. Although it is not the complete opera, the previous recordings have already been many and the essence is still gathered in these two records. This is also worthy of praise. Recently, many records have been fragmented. There has never been a collection of talents to present a complete opera to the world. This is not because talents are hard to find, but because selection is not easy and perseverance is insufficient. I hope that Bei Kai will continue to release similar records in the future, adding a unique brilliance to the record industry.</p>
<p>Shadow Fool of Huangtao, Songjiang</p>
<p>The perch of Songjiang is famous and known to almost everyone in the country. However, Songjiang also has another specialty that is little known to people from other places. What is it? It is the yellow peach. The yellow peach of Songjiang is indeed the best of peaches, but the production is small and only found in a corner of Songjiang. Even the people of Shanghai cannot taste it. The color of the yellow peach is golden yellow with red spots. Seeing its color is already endearing. The larger ones are the size of a fist, full of water, and sweet in taste. Every year in June and July, peach sellers hawk them to customers in the Yue Temple Street area in front of Wangjiang Tower. The larger ones are only ten for a dollar, and the smaller ones are twenty or thirty. The people of Songjiang regard them as treasures and buy them to give as gifts, which are always well received. Last autumn, a friend wanted to join me in running a yellow peach orchard, but we failed to find a suitable site and have not proceeded to this day. In the spring, I visited an orchard outside the South Gate. According to the owner, in a year of abundant peaches, a yellow peach tree can earn a profit of ten to twenty dollars, which can be considered substantial. However, if yellow peach trees are transplanted elsewhere, they often mutate. This may be due to the local climate, but it is also the unique natural product of Songjiang.</p>
<p>Art World News: Novelist Zhang Zhenyuan, who excels at cursive script, has long been admired in artistic circles. Now, to broaden his connections in calligraphy, he is willing to write 500 pairs of couplets. The subject can be specified, and custom-written couplets embedding the names of those requesting the calligraphy will be written. The price is still the original rate: three yuan for each pair of three-foot couplets, plus one yuan for each additional foot, plus 10% for ink. Liangchen Good Friends Society at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road in Shanghai and Liangchen South Store in Dou Shi Street are accepting orders.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (3) (4) (1) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 13: Who Unintentionally Sows Blessings and Gains a Diamond Ring, Only This Fate Leads to Singing of Golden Threads</p>
<p>But by the time the fireworks were set off, it was almost late at night, and everyone was about to disperse. Everyone had been busy for half a day, and the weather was very hot. After eleven o'clock, it was time to rest and prepare to continue the next day. So, all the venues were closing, and many girls were crowding on the grass to watch the fireworks. After the fireworks, they all left. Today was coming to an end. Long Ziyun and Zuo Shichen thought of going to An Kaidi's lottery prize display area to take a look. The prizes won in the lottery were all displayed there for people to see, and they were enclosed in glass cabinets so that people could see them clearly. Several family members were also stationed there to manage the area and sell lottery tickets. The room inside was exquisitely decorated, displaying calligraphy, paintings, antiques. Sometimes, this great female philanthropist, Mrs. Gongbao, would come here to sit. Tourists, looking at the displayed items, saw that they were all treasures and not a kind of cheap prize. The ticket price was also very cheap, only one dollar, and you could get so many treasures. So, everyone couldn't help but have this hope. Looking around, they bought one or two tickets, or ten or eight tickets. In one day, this lottery ticket sales outlet could sell six or seven hundred tickets. These were managed by the young mistresses and young ladies from several mansions. At that time, Shanghai was in the midst of a lottery craze. People, in their poverty and boredom, often dreamed of getting rich, hoping that one day 100,000 taels of gold would fall from the sky, so that they could have all kinds of ways to spend it. But gold would never fall from the sky. The only way to go from being without wealth to having wealth was to win a lottery ticket. Those lottery merchants took advantage of the poor people's desire to get rich and opened their lottery companies on a large scale. Fortunately, the officials and merchants at that time were in collusion. If you wanted to open a lottery company, they would all agree, as long as you paid them a certain amount each month. You could directly fleece the poor, and they would indirectly fleece you. So, in this era, the lottery tickets were truly diverse, divided into Jiangnan lottery tickets, Hubei lottery tickets, Zhejiang lottery tickets, Guangdong lottery tickets. Later, it became so noisy that there was no province without lottery tickets. The covers of the major newspapers were filled with advertisements for these lottery companies, accounting for seven or eight tenths. Either the grand prize was announced, or the grand prize for this month was sold by a small vendor, or it was a message to "come and get rich soon, the draw is about to happen, and the grand prize is still here." At that time, the concession prohibited the sale of lottery tickets. But if you went to Xiaodongmen or Shiliupu, those colorful strips were plastered all over the counters. At first, they were called Jiangnan tickets, Hubei tickets, Zhejiang tickets, Guangdong tickets. Later, they simply abbreviated them to Jiangnan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong, etc. Above these names, they added the words "for sale," thus becoming "for sale Jiangnan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Guangdong," etc. Those who knew better already knew that this was an ominous sign.</p>

<h3>Financial News: Gold Prices Experience a Tragic Plunge</h3>
<p>One Wave of Losses After Another Puts the Bulls in a Miserable Situation</p>
<p>The Price Plummets, Erasing 14.7 Taels</p>
<p>Fluctuations Reach as High as 23.6 Taels Yesterday, the 25th, gold prices saw another low point, and the plunge was swift and unstoppable. This was due to large investors selling off in a frenzy, causing widespread losses. However, the market was chaotic and unpredictable, rising and falling erratically. The total fluctuation of 23-24 taels in one day was truly unexpected, with the price plummeting by more than 20 taels. As for foreign exchange rates, the listing has increased by half a point. The domestic market turned from flat to weak. Banks have been accepting entries. Market participants such as Yuansheng, Taikang, Runxiang, and Yu, acting on behalf of speculative large investors, tended to sell, while buyers were Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongji, and retail investors. The market initially stabilized slightly after a large opening. Later, as various large investors sold heavily, and exchange bills also tended to be tight, especially due to the impact of domestic politics in Japan, the market suddenly turned downward, plunging rapidly by five or six taels. After that, the market fluctuated around 80 taels. At noon, sellers became more aggressive, and the price plummeted by more than ten taels, breaking the 70-tael mark. Later, Taikang, Run, and others continued to sell aggressively, initially falling within 63 taels. However, buyers seemed to become active, and exchange bills also turned flat. The market then recovered to a more moderate level, rising sharply by more than ten taels, eventually remaining above 70 taels. Yesterday, London silver bars were reduced by one-sixteenth, and US silver remained unchanged. Exchange rates have fallen by one-sixteenth.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the market was filled with gloom and despair. The opening price for September gold was 586 taels plus six qian. Before long, the rough market had fallen to 81 taels and a half. Large investors sold, initially setting the opening price at around 83 taels. The listing increased by 1.25 US dollars plus 0.25, and the daily gold price decreased by one cent. However, the gold price was flat, from 82 taels and four qian to three taels and six qian. The initial opening price in the domestic market also seemed to increase. The August price was 6.5 British pence. Banks were buying and selling around ten o'clock, at 79 taels and three or four qian. Suddenly, it increased to 81 taels and six or seven qian. Hedging trades were buying in. HSBC was absorbing September contracts at 6.625 British pence, and Shanghai was entering October contracts at 6.75 British pence. In an instant, Yongchengchang and others sold, and Mitsui also sold September contracts at 6.6875 British pence, causing the price to drop by four taels. At 10:30, it was 77 taels and a half. After entering, Mitsui absorbed September daily gold at 1 tael and 3 qian and 0.5. So, at 11 o'clock, it was 79 taels and seven or eight qian. However, Xiangyu, Yuancheng, Yongfuchang, and others were very willing to sell, and various exchange rates were particularly weak, suddenly falling sharply by more than ten taels. At 11:50, the final price was 66 taels and one qian, then it recovered by one tael and three or four qian. At noon closing, it was 66 taels and seven qian.</p>
<p>After reaching a low point of 62.5 taels, the afternoon market opened at 62.5 taels, falling by four taels due to the frantic selling by Taikang, Run, and others. Later, Indian exchange rates decreased, and various parties began to support the market, eventually surpassing 70 taels and 0.5 qian. Then, it retreated by more than four taels. At 2:30, it was 66 taels, and the daily gold price seemed to loosen. Mitsui bought August contracts at 1 tael, 2 qian, and 9 fen. Later, Datong absorbed October contracts at 1 tael, 2 qian, and 9 fen. Also, the Bank of China and Meifeng were mutually trading September contracts at 37.875 yuan. So, the gold price improved by six or seven taels. Moreover, Xiangyu and others bought in. After 3 o'clock, it was 73 taels. Suddenly, various firms began selling again, and in just over ten minutes, it fell by five taels. After 3:30, Mitsubishi absorbed August daily gold at 1 tael and 3 qian. In addition, the Dalian gang and retail investors bought in, suddenly pushing the price up by five taels. At 3:45, it was 73 taels and three or four qian. However, sellers suddenly emerged on the floor, and by 4:15, it had retreated to 69.5 taels. But people's hearts were very anxious, causing the market to fluctuate wildly, like drifting duckweed. By the time of the 4:30 closing, it was 70 taels and 0.7 qian, a drop of 14.7 taels compared to the previous day. After three or four days of consecutive declines, the total depreciation was 26-27 taels. The exchange followed the regulations to register both the front and back markets (double-closing price).</p>
<p>The final hedging price was 77 taels. The highest price for the day was 586 taels and one qian, and the lowest price was 562.5 taels, a total fluctuation of 23.6 taels. Looking back, the opening price had been changed to 647 taels and four qian. Because the daily gold price was listed at a discount of one cent, the initial hedging price in the morning was a discount of 65-66 taels, and the noon closing price was slightly above 80 taels. The initial hedging price at noon was 84-85 taels, and the final price was 77-78 taels. The registration price in the morning was 66-67 taels, and in the afternoon it was 71-72 taels. The water supplement was 66 taels, and in the afternoon it was 71 taels. The opening price for goods in the morning was 86 taels, at noon it was 68 taels, and in the afternoon it was 63 taels. The closing price was 71 taels.</p>
<p>The buying and selling by various firms was random and without any accuracy. The trading firms included Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, Junmai, Taikang, Run, Yuancheng, Xiangyu, Jinan, Fuyu, etc., all selling. In the afternoon, Taikang, Run,</p>
<p>Tianyu Yong, Yiyu, etc., all sold, in very large numbers. Hengxing, Yuanmao Yong, Shengfeng Yong, Xiangyu, Yuanxing Yong, etc., all actively bought in, and the various firms were buying and selling rapidly, creating a very chaotic situation. The Dalian gang bought more than they sold, with a total of 2500-2600 bars bought and 1700-1800 bars sold. The Guang gang mostly bought in. Also, hedging firms all actively bought in, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Also Listed Higher Yesterday</h3>
<p>The domestic market was initially flat, then loosened... with large fluctuations</p>
<p>Chinese merchants all sold off... the market atmosphere was depressed</p>

Hong Kong remained unchanged at 85 taels and 0.25. However, the large bars had already decreased, and the silver price did not change. As for the domestic market, various exchange rates were initially peaceful, but later loosened due to the tragic fall of the gold market by more than 20 taels. Large investors tended to sell, and people were panicked. In the afternoon, it turned moderate, recovering by about ten taels, and thus tended to be flat. However, as a result, compared to the previous day (the 24th), British gold increased by 0.25, US dollars increased by half a yuan, and daily gold decreased slightly by 1.5 cents. Chinese merchants and speculative firms and the Dalian gang all sold off. It is estimated that more than 200,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and gold merchants sold more than 100,000 pounds. Banks were buying relentlessly. It is estimated that HSBC, Shanghai, and Mitsui all absorbed. Also, several tens of thousands were settled by Mitsubishi and Mitsui. Approximately 100,000-200,000 US dollars were traded. As for daily gold, approximately 1 million yuan were sold to Mitsui, Taiwan, Sumitomo, Korea, Datong, and Mitsubishi by the Dalian gang and others, both near and far term. The market atmosphere has become depressed.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Turns Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local securities and bond market was relatively quiet, with trading activity somewhat subdued. This was mainly due to the calm environment in the bond market, with minimal activity from major players on both the buying and selling sides. Examining the price fluctuations, Customs bonds and Reorganization bonds saw active selling, continuing to decline, especially the current month's futures, which fell by more than one yuan compared to the previous day. However, the next month's futures only fell slightly, about half a yuan. The 25th Year and 27th Year bonds improved by 45 cents. Although Disbandment bonds and other bonds generally weakened, the amounts were minimal, indicating an increasingly sluggish bond market. The total trading volume for the day was only 10,200 yuan for spot transactions and 4.1 million yuan in the morning and 3 million yuan in the afternoon for futures, totaling 7.2 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Gloomy and Trending Downward</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the overseas cotton yarn market continues to decline, causing anxiety. However, some remain optimistic, believing that the autumn sales season is approaching and the inventory of coarse yarn is relatively low, so the bullish sentiment has not disappeared. However, sellers, seeing the overall situation as unfavorable, are still adding to their short positions. Both sides are fiercely contesting, and traders are actively purchasing next month's futures in anticipation of the autumn sales season.</p>
<p>The People's Bourse, Qinfeng, sold 1,000 bales. Before the People's Bourse opened, the market was calm due to the continued decline in US cotton. However, some were buying, with each month only falling by 1.2 to 2.3 cents. New sellers appeared, and short positions increased, causing a further decline of 3-4 cents. Near-month Pingyuan yarn fell by 3.5 cents. In the afternoon, it fell by another 1.2.3 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 11,350 bales. Qinfeng sold the most, 1,000 bales. Other companies like Gongtai, Heshen, Daji, Taisheng, Kangrui, Dasen, Kangxie, Changli, and Chang sold 300 to 1,100 bales. Buyers included Hengyi, Rongxing, Yuantai, Yichang, Yiyu, Maoji, Taixing, and Dafengcheng, with purchases ranging from 500 to 850 bales. The closing prices of the People's Bourse are recorded below, showing the gains and losses:</p>

<p>October: 15.58, Down 0.63, 1,500</p>

<h3>US Cotton Plunge Affects Local Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weak due to the continuous decline in US cotton. There are still many new sellers in the far months. However, buyers have an internal organization in August that buys on dips, leading to short squeezes. Therefore, the market is relatively strong, and trading is very active. The changes in August are difficult to predict. Currently, the two sides are fiercely competing, and those shorting far-month new cotton are more numerous due to the unstable trend of US cotton.</p>
<p>There are many short sellers of far-term Hankow cotton. The Hankow cotton market opened lower in the morning, following the fall in foreign cotton by 0.2-0.3 cents. The afternoon opening was still weak, falling another 0.1 cent. Buyers in the 2nd and 3rd sessions were still buying in August, and the closing price rebounded by 0.05-0.1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 75,500 dan. Xinxing bought the most, 3,100 dan. Other buyers included Tongxing, Yudatong, Yuhe, Shenda, Dachangcheng, Xincheng, Yichang, and Taichangyi, with purchases ranging from 1,000 to 2,700 dan. Lichang sold the most, 5,400 dan. Other sellers included Heshen, Gongtai, Deji, Taixing, Ruid, Dayuande, and Yuantai Xinhua, with sales ranging from 2,000 to 2,700 dan. The closing prices of Hankow cotton are listed below:</p>

<p>New Shaanxi, Shaanxi: 23.75, 34.75. Shanghai factories imported 100 pieces, to be delivered to the factory in January and February.</p>
<h3>Global Yarn and Cotton Plunge in Unison</h3>
<p>US Cotton: Excellent Weather. Yesterday, US cotton prices declined due to favorable weather conditions and smooth cotton harvesting. Sellers pressured the market, leading to a decline in futures of 20-25 points and a decline in spot prices of 25 points. British cotton futures fell by 14 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following US cotton but rebounded due to purchases by Japanese traders. Pingguoer fell by 1 rupee, and far-term contracts fell by 2 rupees. Aomula near and far-term contracts fell by 1 rupee. Bairuoxi was unchanged, and far-term contracts fell by 2 rupees.

<h3>Grain: White Rice and New Rice Fall Together</h3>
<p>Unified Market White Rice Price Fluctuates by One Yuan</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the source of goods from the 12th and 13th of Lilu Road remained sluggish. Northern merchants' machine-milled rice and white rice plummeted by a significant 40-50 cents. The highest price in this market was around 20 yuan. Top-quality goods were scarce and weakened, while medium-quality sub-rice experienced fluctuations of over one yuan. Goods from ships, factories, and warehouses were all being sold off competitively, but there were no buyers, resulting in sluggish trading. The current frenzy in rice prices is not less than the soaring prices of 23-24 yuan. This is also a cyclical cause and effect. New Dong rice arrivals continued to arrive, and prices shortened by another half yuan. The trend opened high at 20 yuan but turned soft, and buying interest remained sluggish. Arrivals at various ports gradually decreased, and the market showed both arrival and sales were light. Prices for ordinary goods also fell by about 20 cents.</p>
<p>Shanghai South, below the river: Shipments of goods from the 7th and 8th continued to see downstream movement. Changbang machine-milled rice was weak, and secondary drops were large. Ordinary goods in this area around 19 yuan were already considered considerable. The Dong new rice market was the same as Zhabei, and prices also opened high by half a yuan at 20 yuan. South merchants' thin rice, top-quality, opened at 20 yuan 23 cents, and medium-quality 19 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. Yangjian Market had poor trading, and foreign rice also declined. Customer demand was sluggish. Currently, ordinary rice is only around 17 yuan, and the decline is no less than that of machine-milled rice. The arrival of white yuan rice was not much, and street sales were extremely slow. The market continued to be small and weak. The overall situation in various stalls was quiet, and there was a tendency to decline further.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Market Stabilizes After Active Afternoon Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very weak in the morning. All types of rice fell slightly, ranging from 30-40 cents to 10-20 cents. In the afternoon, importers, seeing that the market price had rebounded slightly, were keen to transport the rice. Therefore, buyers from the Wuxi, Hangzhou-Shaoxing, and local countryside areas inquired. The sales of large-grain rice were particularly strong, and prices immediately rebounded by 10-20 cents. Other varieties also stabilized. Based on the current market situation, Shanghai has only about 300,000 shi of rice in stock, and prices have fallen repeatedly. Transportation to the inland is gradually becoming possible. Inland merchants are already responding, and the market may temporarily enter a period of stabilization. Yesterday's unified market sales of Da Jiao rice were 3,000 bags, priced at 11.20 yuan to 10.78 yuan; Xiao Jiao 1,600 bags, priced at 13.85 yuan to 70-79 cents; No. 1 Saigon 500 bags, priced at 16.50 yuan to 20-22 cents; No. 2 500 bags, priced at 13.80 yuan to 12.90 yuan; Xiao Jiao rough rice 2,000 bags, priced at 10.15 yuan to 10.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Standard Flour: Near-Month Firm, Far-Month Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market in both the morning and afternoon showed a pattern of near-month firmness and far-month flatness. For the current month, manufacturers have already bought more than they have sold. Although a few small factories have not yet made up for their positions, their inventory is low, making actual delivery difficult. As for the speculators, as the delivery date approaches, they can no longer avoid making up for their positions, so the situation in the current month shows a state of scarcity due to over-purchasing by manufacturers. In the far-term months, inland merchants are generally closing out their positions because an early harvest is expected, so the market is trending downward. As a result, the current month was up 1 cent 2.5 li compared to the previous day, August was down 2.5 li, September was down 0.5 li, October was up 2.5 li, November was unchanged, and December was down 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Bulls Exit, Market Weakens Again</h3>
<p>Spot Market Volume: 11,000+ Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures initially showed firmness but then weakened. The opening price for the current month was still 4.27 yuan, and far-term contracts also rebounded by 2-3 cents. However, as bulls continued to exit, the market weakened again, even though there were rumors of actual delivery for the current month, but manufacturers have not fully negotiated, so the market weakened once the bulls exited. As a result, the current month was down 0.3 cents compared to the previous day, August was up 0.2 cents, September and November were unchanged, and October and December were down 0.1 cents. Spot wheat saw more active purchasing from large factories, so high-quality goods were raised by 1-2 cents, while medium and low-quality goods remained flat and weak and failed to rise. It is estimated that there were over 11,000 bags of Huangqiao, Danyang, Jiangxi, Chentai, Shashi, Hankou, and Yangzhou wheat, including 5,500 bags of Hankou wheat, which were purchased by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Machie Silk Waste Demand Improves</h3>
<p>All Silk Weaving Factories have Resumed Operations ... Futures and Spot Factory Purchases Stimulated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a French firm in this city reported that since the beginning of summer, French silk weaving factories had seen very little trading in silk waste futures due to economic conditions. However, this year, the weather in France has been cold, and sales of silk fabrics have increased. The factories are now resuming operations one after another, and there is demand for both futures and spot silk waste, leading to an improvement in the market. The silk weaving factories are telegraphing inquiries to Shanghai to explore the market situation, and future development is expected soon. The foreign firm silk market in this city remains sluggish. Although there is increasing demand from England and France, and silk telegrams are frequently seen being relayed to Shanghai, the incoming prices are still low, and Chinese merchants cannot afford the silk, making smooth trading difficult. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others purchased about 40 packages of Shangzhong body B-grade Shanghai white factory silk, but prices remained depressed.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea: Russian Sales Improve Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Russian firms assisting the association in Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas showed slightly stronger interest in Gongxi green tea, but they were still demanding in terms of market prices. Yesterday, the firm purchased goods at prices ranging from 48 to 74 taels. Yihe, Tongfu, Fushi, and other firms also actively traded, making the market not so quiet. However, in addition to the bud-tipped goods being sold as soon as they arrive, the remaining Zhenmei green tea tended to be sluggish. It is still difficult to consider the overall market situation for flowers to be improving.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Pulp Prices Slightly Lowered</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of dried longan pulp has been scarce. It is estimated that only a dozen boxes arrived the other day. However, since the current sales are not smooth, the market has become weaker. However, it is said that the opening price has fluctuated by about 2 taels compared to the previous market. Recent transactions have been sporadic, but the inventory is indeed small. Stabilization can be expected in the future. A few pieces of ordinary dried longan arrived yesterday, but the appearance has not yet been seen.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Galvanized Iron Sheets Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, hardware trading was quite active due to successive purchases from Hankou and Fujian merchants. Sales of various goods such as tinplate, new galvanized wire, French West nails, angle iron, and pointed iron were all in the hundreds of dan. Sales of 24-gauge to 28-gauge galvanized iron sheets were even more active. According to investigations, the number of shipments from merchants in this area reached a staggering 1,700-1,800 dan. Due to supply falling short of demand, prices have risen sharply. For example, the market price for 24-gauge opened as high as 12 taels 5 mace and 5 fen per dan, 26-gauge was 13 taels 2 mace, and 28-gauge was 14 taels 1 mace and 5 fen. It is heard that the number of imported sources in the next batch is limited due to the decline in exchange rates, and few fellow traders have ordered them, so the current imports are also few. The stability of the market and the resilience of the market are truly unmatched by other hardware products.</p>

Now, for the 2-week anniversary, the products in the store are especially cheap, and all the products are very affordable. In recent days, the store has been crowded with people, and the staff has been overwhelmed. Ties that originally cost three yuan are now sold for one yuan, and ties that originally cost one yuan and two jiao are now sold for one yuan for two. Scarves that originally cost one yuan are now sold for three yuan for three. There are only a few of these special-priced items left, and they will be sold out soon, so customers have been particularly crowded in the past few days.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>On Nationalism by Zhu Jianbai</h3>
<p>Originally written by Bernard Joseph</p>
<p>Published by the Minzhi Book Bureau</p>
<p>The translator of this book, Mr. Liu Mu, himself said, "In recent years, many people have extended Sun Yat-sen's theories of people's rights and people's livelihood to create specialized books or translate famous foreign works on democratic politics and social policy to compare them with Sun Yat-sen's theories. However, there are very few works that discuss the nature and problems of the nation. The translator's purpose in introducing Dr. Seckler's great work is to fill this gap in the domestic publishing world." Indeed, this specialized book on the nation has value that makes it worth reading for us.</p>
<p>This book first studies the main elements of a nation—language, religion, territory, legends, literature, and the will to live together. Next, it studies the historical origins of national customs and the nations scattered around the world. Finally, it revisits the meaning of the nation, explaining its relationship to the state, patriotism, internationalism, and war.</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly introduce the author's views on national literature, national consciousness, and the relationship between nation and war.</p>
<p>"Although the literature of a nation is not always a constitutive factor of the nation, it is extremely capable of uniting the various elements of the nation and stimulating its national thought. It intensifies the nation's emotions and infuses the nation's elements with national enthusiasm. It constantly burns the spirit of the nation, making them wholeheartedly support their nation. No matter what factors the nation's emotions are based on, even if they are depressed, it can make them rise up and strive." Here, we deeply recognize the relationship between national literature and the future of the nation. We also see that the revival of the Bohemian and Serbian nations was due in no small part to national literature. Therefore, the nationalist literary movement currently underway in China is making efforts to build nationalist literature, which is truly needed in modern China and bears the important mission of stimulating national thought, intensifying national emotions, burning national spirit, and revitalizing the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The author does not talk grandly about world culture but vigorously advocates national culture. This is something we admire very much. He says, "From this, we can know that culture cannot but carry the odor of the nation. The world is too vast, so world culture is still out of reach. Therefore, the progress of civilization relies only on the development of national cultures. Because the environment and nature of each nation are different, it is hoped that a special attribute will be produced to contribute to the common world civilization." This coincides with Sun Yat-sen's words. Sun Yat-sen told us, "We must know where cosmopolitanism comes from. It comes from nationalism. If we want to develop cosmopolitanism, we must first consolidate nationalism. If nationalism cannot be consolidated, cosmopolitanism cannot be developed. From this, we can know that cosmopolitanism is actually hidden within nationalism." Here, we can recognize the path of our efforts.</p>
<p>Regarding the importance of national consciousness, the author of this book says, "Under the command of national consciousness, the members of the nation must also often concretely express their national emotions. For this reason, national consciousness can also be regarded as a concrete factor in national development and unity." At the same time, we see that Italian nationalists are making great efforts to awaken the national consciousness of Italian youth. Those who join their nationalist organization, Young Italy, are made to swear an oath. This shows the Italians' attention to awakening national consciousness and gives us a good lesson.</p>
<p>In the chapter on Eastern national groups, the author says, "Egyptians cannot boast of having literature or culture. In recent years, their only contribution in this area has been nationalist essays of a propagandistic nature in newspapers and pamphlets. They do not have a full understanding of the fundamentals of the nation, and they mistakenly focus too much on political self-determination, paying too little attention to cultivating and training the masses' national consciousness and creating national literature, culture, and ways of life." Indeed, cultivating and training the masses' national consciousness and creating national literature, culture, and ways of life is the only way out for the nation. We see that the nationalist literary movement currently underway in China is working on this step, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>In the chapter on Eastern national groups, the author discusses China, saying, "What they cannot obtain is the development of national consciousness. The support of the patriarchal system prevents Chinese people from having national emotions. They must have this emotion before they feel that they are all part of a group. Therefore, although Chinese people have many material elements of a nation, they cannot be called a true nation because of the lack of psychological and spiritual unity." It is precisely because of the lack of psychological and spiritual unity among us Chinese that Sun Yat-sen said that the Chinese are a nation like a tray of loose sand. We should not be dissatisfied with the author's inability to call the Chinese a true nation, but should take the author's words of warning as our standard of effort to develop national consciousness.</p>
<p>In the chapter on nationalism, patriotism, and war, there is something that deserves our special attention. The author says, "Patriotism and the desire to fight for national glory are often regarded as the fuse of war, and the concept of the nation itself also provokes such ridicule. Some say that the awakening of national sentiment is the reason for the frequent wars in the nineteenth century." However, the author's view is that national concepts have no direct relationship with war. He denies that the wars of the nineteenth century were due to the awakening of the nation. "In fact, it was only the development of the nation that promoted the wars of the time, not the wars that were激 起by the concept of the nation." In other words, the conflicts and disputes of the past were not the fault of nationalism, but the fault of not adhering to nationalism. Therefore, the extension of nationalism is enough to establish considerable equality among nations, thereby eliminating the causes most likely to provoke war." Here, we see that the author absolutely does not advocate narrow nationalism, but advocates establishing equality among nations to eliminate the causes of war, which is consistent with our nationalist's ultimate goal of seeking equal treatment for all nations in the world. However, here, I would like to add a few words for the author. We firmly believe that before the nations of the world have reached complete equality, the various nations are clearly divided into two classes: the oppressor and the oppressed. The aggression and oppression of weak nations by powerful nations is an inevitable situation, and the rise of weak nations to seek self-defense and self-determination is also an inevitable situation. We certainly do not advocate war as the only way to solve national problems, but when "man is the cleaver and I am the fish," when it comes to the life and death of the nation, what other ways to survive do we have besides the last resort of war? We are indeed not blindly advocating war, but the war of national self-defense and the war of national survival should not be forgotten by oppressed nations. Recently, what are these disarmament conferences and non-war pacts? These are all tricks played by imperialism on other nations. It is pitiful that we, the oppressed, have no army to disarm and no war to renounce. Therefore, we must recognize that although national war is a great sacrifice, it is the price that the nation must pay for survival, freedom, and equality. Although the author of this book holds the same view, the words are not clear enough.</p>
<p>The author of this book inevitably has some estrangement in his discussion of Eastern national movements, and at the same time, he trusts the League of Nations too much. However, the whole book is generally very useful for us to study national issues and nationalism. Here, I will not list the introduction.</p>
