<h3 id="c7">海軍會議之成功與失敗 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>據近日消息以觀。在倫敦之海軍會議。對於英美日一方。則又稍有成功。對於英法意一方。則將終於失敗。蓋美日之間。距離較遠。其議題之衝突。不若法意之甚。故勉强得以且就也。</p>
<p>日本政府對於海會之回訓。其國民以爲有危於國防。尚在劇烈反對。然此乃國民對於政府外交之讓步。常有此等表示。未必有碍於海會前途也。且此劇烈反對政府之國民。僅係軍人之一部分。非必全體國民之公意也。</p>
<p>至於法意之爭。則非此比。法見意之勃然以興。恐國防不足以自恃。故欲縮軍。必須乞靈於聯會以自保。意則以新興之國自命。必欲與法立於同等之地位。其間蓋有爭雄競長之心。且寓强弱盛衰之意。故即欲且就而有所不可者。此次海會之發原。原屬於英美而及於日本。對於太平洋其意固重於歐洲。假使英美日三國之協約而成。亦可謂海會一部分之工作已畢。至於歐洲。大槪須俟諸異日矣。</p>

<p>（一）南京大勝湖南九比二</p>
<p>（二）遼寗勝天津三比一</p>
<p>▲南京湖南之戰</p>
<p>開次賽之第一幕者、爲南京與湖南之戰、開賽未久、南京隊即猛攻敵、湖南内衛失足、幸爲守門救出、湖南不失此球、殊屬萬幸以後相持不下者約十分鐘、後南京右翼江之鴻屢有佳妙之傳中、惜中鋒射擊欠準、均未奏效、一次左翼劉祖侃角球、落點頗佳、中鋒趕上頭項、球越横木而過、失之交臂可惜、湖南隊見來勢不佳、努力反攻無奈南京隊内衛森嚴、湖南前鋒難越雷池一步、三十分鐘後南京隊左翼劉祖侃帶球沿邊直入、至適當地位、傅中湖南後衛頭項滑過、遂被南京隊右内鋒從容射入、以後南京隊曾連續射進敵隊兩球、惜均以越位作廢是時湖南隊驚心方定、不料内衛鄧述初又滑進一球、繼而南京右内鋒盤球直入、又中一球　南京隊自得第三球後、聲勢更盛、最後又被右内鋒及左翼連續盤進兩球、上半時遂以五與零結局、易地再戰、最初十分鐘、南京隊聲勢頗盛、左翼劉祖侃得凌遠揚之助、射進一球、湖南隊抖擻精神亦得一球、俄而南京隊右内鋒得右翼之接濟、蹴進一球、二十分鐘時、南京内衛某君在十二碼區域内犯規由湖南中鋒方踢、一脚入網、最後五分鐘又被南京隊鍾冠明凌遠揚攻進兩球、總結果爲九與二、南京勝、</p>
<p>此次湖南隊之敗、由於全體不能合作、接球時慌張異常、時或蝟集一處時或退避三舍、以致被南京隊連續攻進、惟南京隊射擊欠精確、否則對方所負、尚不止此也、裁判唐仲光、兩隊陣線列左、</p>
<p>南京隊　譚仲章　余勉初　顧樹勳　凌惠揚　高立民　顧元亮　鍾冠明　凌遠揚　劉祖侃　江之鴻</p>

<p>▲遼津劇戰情形</p>
<p>遼寗天津之足球戰、兩高均爲能手、此次勝負、關係於决賽者頗大、因此雙方戰來極劇烈、遼前鋒皆體格壯健、勇冠三軍、全隊聯絡亦佳、而尤以兩内衛及中堅之把關截敵、爲難能可貴、傳遞一項、亦可謂已得其門而入、天津方面、則勇敢有餘、智謀不足、實該隊失敗之一大原因、就全隊球藝而論、守優於攻、左前衛孫桂林之截球與還擊、爲全塲絶無之人才、大有使遼寗隊前鋒有行動爲艱之槪、按天津隊上次與浙江隊比賽時、孫君任左内鋒、表演甚佳、今日攻任左前衛之職、前鋒不無大受影響也、開賽後、苦戰半塲、各勝一球、下半時津隊陣線搖動、被遼隊左鋒吴攻融和進一球、未幾又被左翼劉寳打入一球、結果三比一之比、遼寗勝、</p>

<h3 id="c191">昨日田徑賽槪評 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>昨日爲男女田徑賽各項决賽結束之期、上海與遼寗爭奪、田徑錦標肉搏、至爲激烈、觀衆亦較前兩日特别擁擠、特别興奮、兹將各種决賽經過、分别略述於後、</p>
<p>▲二百米</p>
<p>昨日下午二時男子二百米舉行决賽、南北短跑各將又相會面角逐之猛烈、不亞於昨日百米、起賽時劉長春、一反前數日之態度、起跑極快、自始至終、即居第一、達終點時、與鍾連基相距約</p>
<p>十步、成績亦尚佳、足證劉已十分用力、天津周兆元在最初之百米中、速度幾與劉相等、滬鍾落在第三、始距約一米、至終點時、鍾僅超過周一肩、蓋亦險矣、</p>
<p>▲八百米</p>
<p>昨日八百米之决賽、上海鄧志明特别努力、竟以二分零九秒之成績、與造成全國紀錄之王玄基相並、實屬不易、且自始至終、即居首席、遼寗之郎大奎、出發時落在第五、其後雖努力奮鬥、在最後之半圈中、獲居第二、將近終點之三十米時、郎拚命追衝、狀鄧志明已遠在十步外、無法可施矣、</p>
<p>▲低欄</p>
<p>昨日男子低攔决賽、出發時江蘇程錦官居首、北平王玉振廣東梁景平緊緊追趕、至一百二十米左右、粤梁始放開脚步、躍欄如飛、追過王玉振程錦官甚遠、時程已退居第二、成績爲二十秒五分四、破全國紀錄、一九二九年華北運動會黄金　之二十六·八秒、實爲大會出色之成績、</p>
<p>▲女五十米</p>
<p>女五十米、昨日下午决賽、槍聲起處女英雄孫桂雲、即突出人前、穩得冠軍、粤劉有慶黄淑瑋亦殊不弱、苟加努力、前途殊有希望、成績爲七秒五分二、破全國紀錄保持者李遂銀之七·九秒、</p>
<p>▲女百米</p>
<p>昨日妇百米决賽中、仍爲孫桂雲第一、劉有慶第二、相距頗遠、殊無競爭之可言、成績爲十三秒五分四、破一九二九華北運動會佟景伯之十四又五秒、</p>
<p>▲萬米</p>
<p>趙德新絶塵而馳</p>
<p>造成全國新紀錄</p>
<p>成績三十五分三十六秒又五分</p>
<p>萬米决賽　參加者十六人、好手甚多、頗爲全塲注目、遼趙德新東北長距離名將自起步一千米以後、即開始先導、絶塵而奔、脚步健穩、始終如一、最後百米、憑其天賦精力、一部衝前、速率激增、造成三十五分三十六秒又五分之一之新紀錄、深屬難能可貴、滬陳虚舟亦係個中健將、昨已盡其所能、努力奮鬭、則限於體格、不能與地健兒爭一日之長、</p>
<h3 id="c192">三級跳第一司徒光　謝月溪攝 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲撑竿跳</p>
<p>撑竿跳决賽、競爭頗烈、東特符保盧以三米二八得第一、成績尚佳、符君少年英俊、昨尚未至其最佳成績、滬李琳在三米一七即落選、殊可惜、否則滬田徑錦標尚有望、</p>
<p>▲擲標槍</p>
<p>擲標槍决賽、成績四十四米、第一潘南順、與全國紀錄相去甚微、最初津楊春泰以四十二米九八居首席、豈知潘亦於第一次即以四四米五二超過之、</p>
<p>▲女跳遠</p>
<p>女跳遠决賽、成績四米東特吴梅仙第一、廣東謝葵娣劉有慶以三米九六並烈第二、津王志中獲第四、東特孫桂雲因連賽五十米百米、竟致落選</p>
<h3 id="c193">不愧健兒本色 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>劉長春與孫桂雲</p>
<p>遼寗男選手劉長春與東特女選手孫桂雲、自大會開幕以來、連日之成績、已爲各方視線焦點、劉昨（四日）日十三時二百米决賽、又得第一、孫女士於五十米决賽成績、亦超出儕輩、於是各方對於劉孫兩人之企慕、乃有加無已、劉平時爲人梗直、和靄可親、此次參加全運、選手中雖於運動方面、各相競爭、卒因劉之態度、而感情仍甚融洽孫女士不僅以成績服人、其庽柔於勇之態度、尤足引起人家團結、力謀上進之心　昨日五十米决賽後、偕同廣東黄淑瑋女士南京誠恩慈女士席坐塲中、作二十分鐘之體育討論、遇重要處、如起步的姿勢問題、則以莊重而高聲出之、談話間之時以己之手握人之手、以己之首、倚人之臂、其態度之佳實所僅見、昔法體育家道斯在國家體育館演說、有「運動員之有成績無態度者、須再下更深之功夫」一語、設道氏而在塲者、吾知其亦將歡呼讚嘆也、</p>
<h3 id="c194">大會宣傳組徵文 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>

<p>上海特别市敎育局寰球中國學生會登起聯合本市各大學、招待全國運動會各省過滬選手、昨已分發通告、邀請各大學代表於四月八日（星期二）下午三時、在華安八樓大廳開籌備會、</p>
<h3 id="c197">花花絮絮 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>▲高抬物價</p>
<p>會塲及宿舍中、有消費合作社九處、專售香烟點心水菓等物、但其價甚昂、天橋牌每合須二百文、棒糖每塊八十支、水菓點心均比平時漲起四成以上、而大會職員並不顧問、似乎外來朋友、自應敲上幾個小竹槓也、</p>
<p>▲各地方音</p>
<p>每値勝時、二千健兒、齊集飯廳、大嚼特嚼、口中則高談本日比賽之經過、吴音語、各地不同、有硬者、有軟者、有軟而硬者、有硬而帶軟者、與碗　羝響聲相應和、不啻開一方言大會、</p>
<p>▲風頭十足</p>
<p>前日上午、天時不正、微雨奇寒、各選手仍冒風雨、照常比賽、而男選手之大衣、女選手大斃、充滿塲中、到處皆是、而廣東女選手之外衣、一律米色皮領、風頭之健、尤爲特色、</p>
<p>▲人手一根</p>
<p>國貨籐製之司的克、凡游杭者莫不人手一根、以爲游山之用、各選手以其價廉物美、乃相率購買、玩弄手中、意頗自得、</p>
<p>▲傷及雪膚</p>
<p>連日女選手因賽跑跌傷以及患小病者甚多、兹調查如下、（一）浙江隊之羅綺雲（膝上皮傷）、（二）江西隊之馮淑貞（胃炎）、（三）浙江隊之倪韻梅（手指皮傷）、（四）哈爾濱之劉靜貞（上下兩肢傷）、（五）湖南隊之羅惠林（喉痛）、（六）南京隊之張國祺（面部被陽光晒傷）、（七）天津隊之詹宗增（手臂皮傷（八）天津隊之許邦愛（手臂皮傷）、</p>
<p>▲紅白分明</p>
<p>廣東選手所着之運動衣、係白衛生衫、上綴紅字、標明廣東、女選手亦然、而下節男則長褲、女則黑色短褲、在大腿之中、緊緊裹住、行動時、其雙股之間、都作零碎動也、</p>
<p>▲娘子軍招搖過市</p>
<p>兩江女子體育學校全部人才人、均已來杭、一顯風頭、每日從湖濱路一帶赴會場、均係整隊步行、軍樂隊居前、學租軍居中、身負木槍、童子軍殿後、四人一排、約共百餘人、軍樂之聲、極柔婉幽揚頓挫之致、益以鼓聲　　、威壯與温麗相濟、每次來往、市人均竚立以觀、街巷頑童、輒呼娘子軍來了不止、</p>
<p>▲萬衆企望李惠堂</p>
<p>李惠堂球藝超羣、聲震遐邇、不獨浙人士爭覩爲快、即四方遙臨之健兒、亦欲藉此機緣、一觀李氏大顯好身手、無如盛事不常、李氏忽以抱恙回滬、雖於上海隊之實力、不無影響、然一班抱有熱衷者、咸告失望云、</p>
<p>▲張學良介紹馮庸</p>
<p>遼寗馮庸大學校長馮庸、在邊疆努力敎育事業、卓著聲譽、自中東路問題發生、引起中俄交涉、馮氏率領學生軍、親赴滿洲里抗禦、尤著勛勞、此次領隊南來、藉以領略南中風味、張學良氏爲慰勞賢者起見、昨特電達大會爲馮氏介紹、聞馮氏極力提倡運動、對於籃球足球、尤有特殊之嗜好、故日來大會足球籃塲中、不脫馮氏踪迹、</p>
<h3 id="c198">健兒小史 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>

<h3 id="c202">全國運動大會開幕典禮花絮錄 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 頴川馥潤自杭州寄</p>
<p>雄壯熱烈之全國運動大會。已於日昨行開幕典禮於西子湖頭。到會者。多至二萬餘人。記者參與盛典歸來。摭拾塲中花絮數則。爲鵑翁告之。</p>
<p>會塲爲舊大營盤。居梅東高橋之東南。建築宏麗。分田徑賽、足球、棒球、網球、籃球五塲。共佔地可四百畝。司令台居場之西。中列銀奬杯。銀盾數十事。不知爲誰家健兒所得也。台上有蔣主席。曁其夫人宋美齡女士。黨國要人戴季陶、王正廷宋子文、褚民誼、邵力子、陳果夫及浙省主席張靜江等。濟濟一台。頗形熱閙。而吴稚老亦布衣蒞會。演說時滑稽口吻。在在令人笑口大開也。</p>
<p>蔣主席恭讀總理遺囑後。即靜默三分鐘。雖大場中多至二萬人。竟沉默至一無聲息。忽有砲聲隆然。起於場之中央。衆大驚。疑爲炸彈。一時秩序大亂。後經人查詢。始悉二十一響禮砲之煞尾聲也。然已飽受虚驚矣。</p>
<p>致訓詞者。有中央黨部邵元冲。國民政府王正廷等。最後爲蔣主席演說。爲唤起大衆注意起見。另站於梯形高台上。用無線電廣播音浪。蔣之演詞餘喚起國人注意體育外。對於西北閻馮。勾結反動份子。危害中央情形。多所秤擊。警要處。每伸拳示意。悲愴慨愴。全場爲之肅然。</p>
<p>場中恐有反動搗亂情事。故軍警侍衛。戒備森嚴。並禁止發散任何傳單。以遏亂源。意至善也。惟在運動員環立宣誓時。忽有浙省執委會在場大發五色傳單。紅</p>
<p>綠繽紛。片片作蝴蝶之飛。殊好看煞人也</p>
<p>十一時散會。蔣主席偕夫人歸西湖蔣莊進膳。沿途新聞記者爭相攝影。四五十人蠭擁圍住。謔者爲總司令受包圍不已。</p>
<h3 id="c203">奇病 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 稽覲</p>
<p>湖州西鄕有老嫗者。年近花甲。髮如漆。長逾踝際。漢爲青年婦女所不及。一日晨起櫛沐。偶被篦齒所傷。血流如注。急用敷藥止之。半月以來。遂有種種之變狀最奇者。人或觸其一髮。則全部覺痛。痛時根根蜷曲。必逾一小時後始已。</p>
<p>據某西醫云。昔巴黎一婦人。素患癎症。稍一發作。髮必上竪。狀極可怖。於以知髮在人身。亦通神經。實有感覺之性。惟血氣充旺者。雖至老年。可不秃落。彼老嫗素爲多血質。醫治罔效。恐將成爲瘋癲也。</p>
<h3 id="c204">高英案續審引記 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 宗豫</p>
<p>前舊金山副領事高英。因其夫人廖氏。代人私帶行李。内藏烟土。被美海關查獲。高氏夫婦有販土嫌疑。引渡回國。經江寗地方法院分别判處徒刑。高氏不服。提起上訴。昨於江蘇高等法院第二次審理。予震於該案之名。特往旁聽。爰記會塲花絮。以餉讀者諸君。</p>
<p>▲會塲鳥瞰　昨日下午二時。於該院第一法庭開始審理。庭爲我國古式大廳。極爲寬廣。中懸總理遺像及遺囑。兩旁柱上黏有對聯。文曰整綱飭紀。。除暴安良中爲審判官席。其後爲長官旁聽席。前爲被告就審處。律師席居庭之正中。兩旁爲記</p>
<p>者席。旁聽席在律師席之後。佈置極爲整潔。雖旁聽者有三四百人。始終靜默無喧。誠嚴肅也。</p>
<p>▲旁聽券求之不易　法院鑒於上次該案開審時之擁擠。此次散發旁聽券。限制特嚴。凡索券者須由機關或團體具函介紹。由該院公報處專司其事。故不得其門而入者。不下數百人。旁聽者以各機關代表職員及學界居多數。婦女竟佔全數十之四。亦可見女界注意法治之一般矣。</p>
<p>▲黑色化的高廖氏　高夫人所御服裝除玉色絲襪外。滿身黑化。頭上鬈髮蓬鬆。遮蔽兩頷。併裹一繡有黑花之元色薄紗。紗下垂及背。衣黑印度綢旗袍。黑絨高跟鞋。身段豐娜。而面目黧瘦。神色頽然。已異舊觀。</p>
<p>▲兩個洋行跑街　高英孫垣。均穿小脚西裝褲。中式棉袍。長僅過膝。頗類洋行跑街。但高氏藍洋布袍。黑直貢呢鞋。遠不及孫氏綢袍皮鞋之漂亮。孫垣神態尚覺自然。高氏則垂頭喪氣。頗現痛苦之狀。旁觀者念其英俟有爲。亦不禁爲之惋惜。</p>
<p>▲劉律師被人包圍　該案雖爲第二次審理。因案情複雜。昨仍審問事實。未及辯論。律師始終無發言機會。散庭後各報記者羣向高英辯護律師劉世芳探詢。對於該案意見及辯詞。劉律師以尚未到發表時間。向之婉辭。亟回至律師休息室。各記者仍環問未散。劉律師乃將當庭呈騐之舊金山華爾萊律師證實龔總領與高英意見不合之來信及其他足爲證據之函件。交各記者抄錄。始得脫圍。</p>

<p>— 全國步行團員劉漢儒</p>
<p>三月二日往常熟。在常連日遇雨。致不能前進。承中華全國道路建設恊會常熟分會招待一切。常熟新聞事業極發達。全城有十二報館之多。如琴報較大。日出一千五百份。以一小縣城。有報館十餘家。恐不多見也。八日承該分會總幹事程君俊彥導游虞山。延至十日下午始離常赴錫。十日晚宿常錫交界處之王莊鮑君家。翌晨約行十里許即遇雨。仍冒雨前進。由小漸大。雨衣失其效用。加以泥濘載途。一步一滑。同志徐君竟連跌四次之多。大有行不得也之概。六時抵無錫。衣裳内外均濕。如落湯之鷄。在錫躭擱數日。參觀各工廠。並游惠山及梅園等處。十五日離錫赴常州。在常訪江南名士錢名山（振煌）先生。十六日下午離常州赴丹陽。是日晚宿該縣新閘鎭。鄕人均閉户。因天尚未黑。决無就寢之理。後駐軍劉排長來告曰。適間有鄕人來吾處報告云。有土匪六名抵鎭。故皆閉户。當告以吾等事業。由劉排長向鄕民解釋。始各釋然。幸劉排長未貿易從事。否則率兵開槍。吾等又疑係土匪打刦。如是誤會。不堪設想矣。十七日上午五時起程。下午六時抵丹陽城。在丹勾留一日。十八日晚露宿於離鎭江十里之渣澤車站。十九日黎明抵鎭江。値省府改組。某日新聞報鎭江通訊欄内敝團乘車抵鎭。不確也。二十四日離鎭赴京。晚宿龍潭水泥廠。二十五日晚抵京。進太平門。曁大鄭校長韶覺先生特闢曁大同學會。爲吾等下榻之所。此爲由滬至寗之簡單紀事也。</p>
<p>此次計行三十三日抵京。途中平均每日走六十里以上。每公里約一千四百步。鄕下人有謂吾等係量鐵路者。有謂吾等係做生意者。種種傳說不一。起居上或睡銅床。或臥草地。或食山珍。或啖饒餅。環境日異。肉體略感痛苦。然精神彌增快感。逸趣横生。吾等向官廳取件參考。而順道向民間證實之。擬在京勾留旬日。再渡上沿運河北上。甚盼滬上諸先進時加指示。以匡不逮也。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 桑俊甫</p>
<p>吾鄕上虞。山水秀麗。景物天然。其處錢江支流。而林壑優美者。則爲西門外相距約四十里遙之西華村。其間有沼曰雙蓮藕池者。亦名勝之區也。相傳該池係宋趙時被潮水冲决而成。昔梁山伯爲上虞縣令時。每至暑期。間嘗率其僚屬。遊釣其間。池不甚深。顧面積綦廣。而淤泥獨厚。池中遍植荷藕。每屆仲夏。當荷葩怒放之際。十里荷香。風景絶佳。詎該池中近忽有一種甲殼類產生。形似蟹而略小。其背殼色微紅。與尋常煑熟後之蝦殼色相髣髴。而有紋作耳目口鼻狀。蔚成奇觀。鄕人見之。靡不嘖嘖稱異弗置。旋據浙中老於漁者言。謂此種甲殼類名曰關公蟹。昔浙南金·衢·嚴等處。亦嘗有少許發現。今則已杳然無睹。至於此蟹之產生。係關公被害之後。其血流入水間而生者云云。余以此說大類齊東野語。不足爲徵。惟此甲殼類之產生。則實爲可異。爰誌之。以供博物學者之研究。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席晤名伶</p>
<p>這時青柳社中。有一位最興高彩烈的人。此人姓陸。喚作陸君扶。他是常州人。留學日本也有年了。他還討了一個日本女人做夫人。原來中日兩國。畢竟是同種同文。所以有許多日本女子。都喜歡嫁中國人。以體魄言。中國男子態度軒昻。不似日本人的短小委瑣。尤其是像陸君扶那樣。站在日本男子中間。更顯得似鶴立雞羣。他本來是個高幹兒。尤有一件是日本女子願嫁給中國人的。是日本女子很苦。他們以待奉男子爲天職。實在講起來。日本男女最不平等。在中等人家。都不能用備人下女。一切事都要自己來做。甚而至於赤了脚。洗擦地板等等。也要親執其勞。中國却中等人家。也用一個老媽子或是小丫頭。女人便動不動自尊爲太太。吃飽了飯可以不做事。或者叉叉小麻雀。消遣永晝。所以經幾個嫁過中國人的一說。見着如此寫意。不名羨慕起來。因此那時日本女人願嫁中國留學生的很多。陸君扶也是青柳社社員之一。他在新劇中扮演一個小生。最是風流藴藉。在公演之前。他是奔走最力。他們選擇的一個脚本。喚做「不如歸」。這不如歸。本是日本一部著名的小說。是一位日本的小說家德富蘆花生所撰的。這一部小說出來。頗閧動一時。差不多是人手一編。連歐洲人也都譯成了西文。在日本便把他編成了劇本。在劇塲中演過幾次。他們在日本留學的時候。自然也都去看過。後來他們的青柳社裏。也曾經演過一二次。日本人演的時候用日本話。中國人演的時候當然用中國話了。好在他們戲劇。都有脚本公之於世。你只要購買了他們脚本。研究起來。而且日本的演藝家。也都是文士。不比中國的所謂唱戲的。有的連字都不識。却是一班粗人。因此他們在日本演那齣不如歸的時候。請他們來指導。他們都欣然願意。這不如歸一齣戲。却是家庭悲劇。描寫一個女子。嫁了一個丈夫。他們伉儷很篤。不想伊的婆婆。却十分厲害。因爲那個媳婦是有肺病的。所以趁伊的兒子出去從軍的時候。把伊的媳婦　出去了。那女子肺病很深。經過這塲打擊。便死在母家。伊的母親。又是一位繼母。後來直到死時。没有見到伊的丈夫。而丈夫得着伊的死信時。自己也因了受傷而在野戰的病院中。</p>

<p>— 輕飛</p>
<p>春又來了、「春到貧家不當春」、在精神上貧窮者（Ｐｏｏｒｓ　ｉｎ　Ｓｐｉｒｉｔ）看來、還覺得没曾描寫到格、</p>
<p>嫩黄的楊柳、嬌囀的小鳥、活潑的小學生、雄健的賽跑家、並步低語的情人們、在江灣路上、在常人的眼中、在光楣的眼中、自然是寫得來敎人艷羨、在我的眼中却祇給我段片的深刻的感慨與沈默罷了、</p>
<p>「洋裝衣架的」的「釘」、我却並不像光楣那般感到了一百二十分的不快、有時覺着不自由而感到討厭、（我誠實地說）有時在下意識裏却也得到些快意丨上意識裏自然没有他們的地位、然而、一嚮目空一世固執自信的我、近來也覺得只是一個女孩兒了、人們的道德是怎樣的靠不住喲、有時竟會假設他們是可憐蟲、也竟會在一刹那間想到馮小青的「願得一滴楊枝水、灑作人間並蒂蓮」一詩、笑着偷偷地和冰說了、她也笑着說、「如果我有兩個身體、一個讓她墮落、嘗嘗墮落的味兒、到底任性去墮落好呢、還是規矩好」、</p>
<p>隔壁房裏的珍、常念“Ａｓ　ｆｌｉｅ　ｔｏ　ｗａｎｔｏｎ　ｂｏｙｓ　ｗｅ　ａｒｅ　ｔｏ　Ｇｏｄｓ，ｔｂｅｙ　ｋｉｌｌ　ｕｓ　ｗｉｔｈ　ｔｂｓｉｒ　ｓｐｏｒｔｓ”（和兒童掌中的蠅子一般、我們在神魔掌中玩弄至死）、「是這樣的嗎」、我常常學着她念了之後、舉頭自問、「究竟是這樣的嗎」、然而因此珍却是出名爲「洋化黛玉」了、只是「Ｍｒ寳玉」却終是未曾會面、我一回取笑她（在晚餐後的江灣路上月光之下）說、「Ｍｒ寳玉要是尋着了、我們的黛玉或須還更洋化而成Ｃｌａｒａ　Ｂｏｋｗ了」、她笑說、「Ｃｌａｒａ　Ｂｏｗ、再好没有了、我若是能夠騙我變成了她」、</p>
<h3 id="c234">關於自殺的研究 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 涵澤</p>
<p>自殺一件事、不但只是精神病學上的重要研究問題、而且和犯罪、賣淫·貧困·失業·結婚等一樣、是個我們所不能付諸等閑的社會問題、自殺、並不是近來文明世界所產生出來的、遠在古代已經就有的了、在歐洲基督敎還没傳播以前、自殺在道德上也被所容認、在東洋丨尤其是中國和日本丨則更甚、譬如忠臣之對於其君、烈婦之對於其夫、往往因自殺而芳名傳流萬世受世人之所欽敬、像日本在明治維新以前、武士有過、則自剖自腹（日人呌做「切腹」Ｐｅｐｐｕｋｕ）、以謝其君、不過這種的自殺、是他們之特殊的傳統和環境的產物、和我們現在在這裏所講的自殺、是不能常做一樣的、你如果讀了夬庵先生的「一個貞烈的女孩子」、你便會明白那些古時之所謂忠臣烈婦之自殺殉節、除了因爲受了當時社會的習慣風俗制度道德之所迫不得已而行的之外、還有受了他們的親長强制的令其殉節的！丨嚴密地說、這種實在不能呌做「自殺」、只好叫牠做「他殺」</p>
<p>現代、自殺只是日多於一日、在文明諸國、這個現象更甚、不但只是自殺人數、就是對人口的百分率、也是年年益增越加、而且這種增加、又非常的迅速、實有可驚的、譬如德國、自一八三六年至一九一、年約七十五年之間、全國人口不過只增加了四一一一、而自殺人數在普魯士（Ｐｒｅｕｓｓｅｎ）竟自一、四四六人增至八、一七九人（約五○六倍）、在薩克遜（Ｓａｃｈｓｅｎ）則自一六二人增至一、五七三人（約九·七倍）、其餘各國、也都有這種的現象、像自一八七○年至一九○○年之間前後不過僅僅三十年、而自殺的人數、在奥地利却自一五六○人增至四、二一五人（約二、七倍）意大利自八三六人增至二、○四○人）約二、四倍）法國自四、四九○人增至八、九二六人（約二倍）美國自一、四九五人增至二、八九六人（約一、九倍）瑞西自三二一人增至七四、六人（約二、三倍）這種的統計、是否靠得住我們却不敢的確地說、但是自殺之一天多於一天、那是絲毫没有疑問的餘地的、日本自殺的人、比歐美諸國更多、大正五年、（民國五年）自殺人數有九、五九九人、到了大正十四年（民國十四年）竟增至一二、二四九人、我國對於自殺人數没有什麽精確的統計、然據上海特别市政府社會局所統計的、民國十八年七月一個月之中、只在上海一個地方、自殺件數竟有二六五件之多、其中死的五八人、被救的一九五人、不明的三人、較之十七年八月（二三七件）增多了二十八件、現在上海自殺的件數、日多於一日、這確是我們所不能否定的、</p>
<p>照這樣文化越發達、而自殺者也越增加、且都市的居民比較的占大部分、這是爲什麽緣故呢、在一方面、社社越進化、社會組織社會生活也越複雜、因而不能達到慾望之充足的自然也越多、在他方面、物質的文明、把都市的居民漸漸變導爲神經變質的緣故、自殺的原因、最多的是在於有什麽慾望不能充滿的時候（如失戀、厭世等、）或失却了社會上的地</p>
<p>位財產等的時候、所以那些慾望没有發達的低能者和没有什麽地位或財產可失之極度的貧因者、自殺便比較的少、自殺、除因於這些外的事情之外、還有因於内的事情的、像精神的亢奮或異狀等是、</p>
<p>自殺的年齡、不論男女、在十五六歲至三十歲的最多、而且男子比女子較多、據日本昭和三年（民國十七年）的統計、自殺者的年齡、在男子則二十歲至二十四歲的最多、共有一·一○六人、十五歲至十九歲的次之、五九六人、二十五歲至二十九歲的又次之、七○二人、在女子則二十歲至二十四歲的最多、七九二人、十五歲至十九歲的次之、六九六人、至於女子的自殺比男子較少的原因、因爲女子對於直接生活上的責任較輕而且對於破產、失業等的痛苦也比較的薄的緣故、女子自殺的原因、大都出於性的關係、照這樣不論男女、自殺都在青春期最多、然而在六十歲以上至八十歲之壽比南山的老人、自殺者却也不少、他們大都因爲老後之生活困難、病苦寡獨、或家庭不和的緣故而至於自殺、</p>
<p>還有一層、足以引起我們的注意和興味的、就是在外國自殺者男子大都比女子多些、在我國則不然、有時女子却反比男子多得很、據上海特别市社社局所統計的、民國十八年七月、上海之自殺案共有二三七件中、男的一一六件、女的一四○件、占全數之五四·六九　、且一年之中、以七八月最多、對於這層、社會局推其因而這樣地說、「自殺、如果因於生計困難、那末當在嚴冬的幾月間最多、」然在事實上却不然、自殺多在於七八月酷熱之時、因爲自殺多因於口角的緣故、七八月因不能忍受鴿籠式房屋内的熱氣而走向里弄裏去納凉、致以和隣居接觸的機會多而自然也會增加隣居吵嘴的機會、直接的說就是增加自殺的機會、而且暑天的鬱悶、足以使意志薄弱的婦女更受不起剌激而走向自殺、又這二六五件自殺案之中、因於家庭問題的有一四七件、佔全數之五七、四三　、足見我國家族制度的壞處、</p>
<p>至於自殺的方法、也很有研究的價値、就是自殺的方法、含有一種的流行性、譬如在日本、自明治三十五年（一九○二年以來、因那第一高等學校高材生藤村操投於華嚴瀧以後、一時投身瀑布的自殺大流行、宛然成了一種的時髦、弄得當局慌忙莫及、其後則流行服一種呌做「縮水二路酸二鉀」（Ｐｏｔａｓｓｉｕｉｎ　ｂｉｃｈｒｏｍａｔｅ）的毒藥、到大正六七年（民國六七年）來、自一種呌做「不用着貓」（Ｎｕｋｏ　ｉｒａｚｕ）的殺鼠藥發明了後、自殺的人十中八九都用這種殺鼠藥來殺自身、及近來、又變出一種的新花樣出來、流行用睡眠劑的自殺法、像那很有名的文學家芥川龍之介氏就是服睡眠劑而自殺的、此外從來雖有一種以鐵路當枕的自殺法（他們日人呌做「鐵道自殺」）、然因死後未免太悽慘、所以不能很盛旺地流行、照這樣自殺者會被了這種流行所支配着、那並不是</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>他們的意力的、可說　　說明着人類之極富於暗示性和模做性的、至於中國的自殺方法呢、最多的是服毒、而且大部分都是服鴉片、如果我們對於本埠新聞留意些、對於道層便能夠明白了、據社會局所統計的、十八年七月之二六五件自殺案裏、服毒的有二一五件、占全數之八三、九八　、自縊的一○件、投水的二一件、自戕的二件、呑金的八件、</p>
<p>若說起自殺的心理、我們並不是心理學專家、所以不但步敢說什麽、而且也没有什麽可說、不過我們可以把那自殺的文學家芥川龍之介氏之絶筆「致某舊友的手札」裏抄錄出些來做參考、（據沈端先氏的譯）</p>

From now on, the command and leadership of the Shanxi army will be entirely under Feng Yuxiang's orders. Feng Yuxiang will go to Zhengzhou within a week, and Yan Xishan will also go to Shijiazhuang before or after him. They will establish a general headquarters there and plan to meet with Feng in Zhengzhou. After two months of negotiations between Yan Xishan and Wang Jingwei, an agreement has been fully reached because Wang agreed to change his previous advocacy of reorganization. As for establishing a government, it is not yet being discussed until the military issues are resolved. (4th Day Japanese News Agency Wire)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since Yan, Feng, and Li assumed their positions as commander and deputy commanders, military actions by the various armies along the Longhai Railway line have become increasingly active. The Northwest Army may arrive in Kaifeng within a few days. Wan Xuancai's vanguard has reached Ningling, and is in contact with Sun Dianying's army. Shi Yousan's army is eyeing Shandong from Caozhou. A portion of the Jin army is moving south from western Shandong and another portion from Dezhou along the Jinpu Railway line, attacking Jinan. Within a few days, the various armies will coordinate with each other and launch a unified offensive. The atmosphere in the Guide area along the Longhai Railway line has become tense, and a conflict with the Central Army is imminent. (4th Day Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters released a supporting telegram from Beiping: (1) Yan telegraphed Feng, stating that he had been supported by the people of the nation to take overall charge of military affairs and reorganize the Central Plains.

After the Northwest Army arrives in Zhengzhou, it will not advance further for the time being. (4) Yan, fearing Feng's designs on Hebei, is building strong fortifications in the areas of Shunde, Shijiazhuang, and Daming. (5) Yan promised to issue weapons and ammunition to the Northwest Army, but has not yet done so. Yan has issued Shi Yousan with more ammunition than the Northwest Army, so the Northwest Army generals are complaining and expressing dissatisfaction with Yan. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Success and Failure of the Naval Conference <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Judging from recent news, the naval conference in London has been somewhat successful for the UK, the US, and Japan. However, it is likely to end in failure for the UK, France, and Italy. The distance between the US and Japan is relatively far, and the conflicts of agenda are not as severe as those between France and Italy. Therefore, a reluctant compromise may be reached.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's instructions to the naval conference are considered by its citizens to endanger national defense, and they are still vehemently opposed. However, this is a common expression of the people's dissatisfaction with the government's diplomatic concessions. It may not hinder the progress of the naval conference. Moreover, these citizens who are vehemently opposed to the government are only a part of the military, and do not necessarily represent the public opinion of the entire nation.</p>
<p>The dispute between France and Italy is different. France, seeing Italy's rapid rise, fears that its national defense is insufficient to rely on itself. Therefore, if it wants to reduce its military, it must rely on the League of Nations for self-protection. Italy, on the other hand, regards itself as a newly rising nation and insists on being on an equal footing with France. There is a sense of rivalry and competition between them, and it implies the strength of the strong and the decline of the weak. Therefore, even if they want to compromise, it is impossible. The origin of this naval conference belongs to the UK and the US, and extends to Japan. It is more focused on the Pacific than Europe. If an agreement can be reached between the UK, the US, and Japan, it can be said that part of the work of the naval conference has been completed. As for Europe, it will probably have to wait for another day.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Aviation Administration, in response to military needs, has established a Forward Headquarters with three sections: staff, secretarial, and adjutant. A main station will be established on the Jinpu Line in Xuzhou and Bengbu, and on the Pinghan Line in Xiangyang. Zhang Huichang concurrently serves as commander-in-chief. The personnel of each section are all transferred from within the Administration. It has been approved by the Ministry of Military Affairs and will be established soon. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Aviation Administration believes that the original organization is simple and insufficient for military work. It has now been approved to expand the organizational structure: 1. The General Affairs Office will have three sections: documentation, accounting, and general services. 2. The First Division will have three sections: general affairs, education, and inspection. 3. The Second Division will have three sections: aviation affairs, military medicine, and machinery. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original organization of the Air Force consisted of the first, second, and third squadrons. Later, during the campaigns against Gui and Feng, the fourth and fifth squadrons were added. Also, the aircraft squadron brought by Zhang Huichang from the Guangzhou Aviation Office was reorganized into the sixth, seventh, and eighth squadrons. The combat strength is said to be sufficient.

In the Nanyang area, the enemy passed through Neixiang, and another large force of rebels is advancing towards Xichuan. The previous rumor that the main force of the rebel army would first attack Nanyang and then Xiangfan seems unreliable. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Yougu telegraphed the Field Headquarters, saying that the rebel troops in Xichuan, including Liu Ruming's, Tian Jinkai's, and Nie Yuling's forces, number about 10,000. Their weapons are not complete, their morale is exhausted, and they have no fighting spirit. In addition, they lack supplies, with each person receiving only two steamed buns a day, so many are deserting. Our army has six fighter planes in Henan and Hubei. When the rebel troops see the planes flying, they all run away with their heads in their hands. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

It was decided to dissolve Harbin College and strictly arrest reactionaries. Ten people were arrested in the evening. On the evening of the 2nd, the Harbin press held a meeting to support the International Concorde Press and requested that the government thoroughly resolve the matter in three days.

Late at night, representatives met with various bureaus. Recently, all sectors in Harbin have been indignant about this matter. (3rd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) After the International Concorde Press was raided, the editorial on the 4th said that the chaos in Chinese politics lies in the fact that those who lead the masses do not distinguish right from wrong. Judging from this action that endangers this newspaper, it is enough to prove that what we rely on for life is only a newspaper. Now that the newspaper has been destroyed, there is nothing else to worry about. We only have to continue our past firm stance and fight to the end. Zhang Bao'en, who destroyed the newspaper, has already been arrested. All factories in Harbin are under martial law. Special police detectives are searching for reactionaries in all directions on the 3rd. (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Deputy Minister Zhang Weihua Reports on Recent Diplomatic Developments <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted reporters from both inside and outside Beijing at the Ministry's auditorium at 11 AM on the 4th. More than 20 people attended. Deputy Minister Zhang Weihua reported on recent diplomatic developments as follows: (1) The Shanghai Provisional Court was reorganized into the Shanghai Special District Court on the first of this month. According to Article 9 of the agreement, each side will send two representatives to resolve court disputes at any time. The British side has appointed Mr. Ge Gemeng, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, and the American side has appointed Mr. Jacob, the American Consul in Shanghai, as representatives. The Judicial Yuan of our country has appointed Qian Tai and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed Xu Mo as permanent representatives stationed in Shanghai. As for court expenses, there is a surplus of about 200,000 before the reorganization, and the plaintiff's bail is also 200,000, all of which have been handed over to the new court for reception. In addition, all officials, bailiffs, and police officers in the court are wearing Chinese uniforms, completely changing the old habits. Regarding the prison issue, it has been decided that female prisoners will be placed by China outside the concession, and male prisoners will still use the previous Western prison, but the court can go to inspect or direct everything at any time. (2) Regarding the conclusion of a treaty between China and Peru, according to a telegram from Wei Zijing, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Peru, the Peruvian government is willing to accept the principle of equality proposed by China. However, one point is about the will issue. The treaties between Peru and the United States and Japan are handled according to the laws of the country where they are located. Our country now intends to state in the treaty that it should be handled according to the laws of each country, which is being discussed. (3) Our country has about 3,000 overseas Chinese in Panama, most of whom are engaged in small businesses. Because there is no treaty between China and Panama, there is no corresponding guarantee. It is now planned to conclude a treaty with them, which has been agreed upon, and Li Zhizhong, our country's consul general in Panama, is in contact. (4) Regarding the Japanese ban on overseas Chinese landing, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a formal report. Yesterday, Uemura, the Japanese consul stationed in Beijing, came to the Ministry and asked about the content. According to the reply, there is no factual proof, but the newspaper records that there is a reason for the incident. According to his speculation, it may be due to inspection of diseases or other reasons. However, the details still need to be investigated from his country. The consul also made a request regarding the suspension of mail from the Shanghai Daily News, and said that the New Year's Day editorial was disrespectful to the National Government and was loyal advice in terms of friendship and there was no malice. He now guarantees that this kind of thing will not happen again, please give it convenience, and incidentally put forward the matter of the detention of the Shandong Japanese newspaper in Qingdao. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained each item one by one, and generally said that there were no other reasons, and the government would never detain it. If it is exempted from being detained, the content should be banned first. The consul replied that he would ban it as far as he could. (5) Because Minister Wang is the president of the Far East Games, he went to Hangzhou to meet with the national players. He has arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday. He originally planned to come to Shanghai today, but because he needs to continue to discuss the issue of Sino-Japanese legal rights with the Japanese Deputy Minister Shigitsu in Shanghai, and attend the banquet of the Turkish Acting Representative this Sunday, he will not return to Beijing this week. (6) Regarding the arrival of the Japanese First Torpedo Battle First Fleet tunnel’s Tenth, Thirteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-Seventh Destroyers in Beijing, Japanese military attaché Sasaki visited Mayor Liu at the city government some days ago to contact him, and said that the ship came here to visit the new capital construction and respectfully visit the Prime Minister’s Mausoleum. Mayor Liu replied that because there was no formal official business, he asked him to supplement it. The military attaché then went to visit Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of the Navy, and said that the captain of the ship intended to meet the Chairman, and Chen agreed to convey it. Now the Executive Yuan believes that since they are here in Beijing on a friendly visit, of course it cannot be refused, and has issued an order to notify this department. As for when the ship comes to Beijing, it should follow international practice and fire a salute first to show respect, and then stop after our country responds to the salute. In addition to the military and police taking care of it at any time, our country does not formally entertain it. If the ship holds a banquet, our country’s officials will all wear domestic casual clothes to show respect for the country. After the report, the meeting adjourned (4th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jurists Agree on Report</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 4th: The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Mail says that apart from the Tripartite Entente becoming a reality, the situation at the Naval Conference is now tense again. There are two reasons: (1) The French are now openly declaring that political talks and the work of the Naval Conference are not related. France must first obtain a satisfactory explanation of the ambiguous wording of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations before it can discuss reducing shipbuilding. (2) The Italian representative, Grandi, has stated to the British Prime Minister that the Covenant of the League of Nations must be interpreted by the League of Nations itself in Geneva. If only a few member states interpret it, Italy cannot participate. The Italian representative also strongly protested that the Naval Conference has stalled its true work and is instead discussing extraneous matters. The Italian representative cannot wait indefinitely. ▲Reuters, London, 3rd: The reservations in the Japanese government's reply are not seen as a serious obstacle by the public. Representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have met to discuss these reservations and decided to submit them to a committee of naval experts for examination. The committee will discuss the matter tomorrow morning. The British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary met with the Italian representative, Grandi, today and reportedly discussed drafting a formula to satisfy France's security demands.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd: The jurists of the Five-Power Naval Conference today agreed on humanitarian measures for submarines and will submit a report to the First Committee.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd: The American representatives believe that the U.S. Senate can accept the agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. Under this agreement, Japan can build cruisers of less than 20,000 tons and some small destroyers, but no submarines. Senator Reed is the main figure in the negotiations with the Japanese Ambassador and is very satisfied with the spirit of goodwill between the United Kingdom and Japan towards the United States. He said that the representatives of the three countries were all frank and fair, with no evasiveness. This result is not a victory for any one party, but a honorable and reasonable solution for all three. ▲Dentsu, London, 4th: Regarding the reservation clauses recorded in the Japanese government's response, the plenipotentiaries of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan held a meeting on the 2nd, and again on the morning of the 3rd, at St. James's Palace. The plenipotentiaries of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, including Wakatsuki, Stimson, and MacDonald, attended. First, Wakatsuki, in his capacity as a plenipotentiary, explained in detail the Japanese reservations and desired conditions, especially the construction of replacement ships for submarines, light cruisers, and destroyers, stressing that for the sake of maintaining shipbuilding capacity, he requested that early construction be approved. The United Kingdom and the United States did not raise any objections to Japan's request. However, the specific plan for early construction must be investigated and decided by a committee of experts. The appointment of the committee has been completed, and the committee of experts will open at 10:00 a.m. on the 4th.</p>
<p>Jiji Press, Tokyo, 4th: London, 3rd dispatch. The Legal Committee of Experts of the Disarmament Conference has reached a consensus on the issue of humanitarian use of submarines. Its content takes the gist of Article 1 of the Washington Conference's Five-Power Treaty on Submarines and stipulates that the restrictions on surface ships apply to submarines. The draft treaty, proposed by Mr. Martin, Legal Advisor of the British Foreign Office, will be presented to the First Committee in the form of a report in the next two or three days. Jiji Press, Tokyo, 4th: London, 3rd dispatch. The American Plenipotentiary Headquarters officially announced today that complete agreement has been reached on the tripartite agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In addition, according to the official announcement of the American Plenipotentiary Headquarters, at the tripartite plenary meeting between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan held at the palace today, the United Kingdom and the United States expressed their acceptance of Japan's various reservations. The only point that has not been resolved is the details in Japan's reservations regarding the scrapping of vessels not for the purpose of a complete holiday for shipyards, and regarding substitute vessels. However, it is not difficult to reach an agreement on this issue either. It is reported that among all the reservations of Japan, there are no items that are difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, London, 3rd: The Disarmament General Assembly, which was originally scheduled to open on the 4th, has now been indefinitely postponed. This is because French Plenipotentiary Briand, at the meeting of the Chief Plenipotentiaries, advocated postponement, saying that negotiations between the three countries have reached the point of compromise, and there is hope for progress in the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. From the perspective of the overall situation, there is no benefit in opening the General Assembly at this time to state the positions and stances of various countries.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 4th: According to various newspapers, British Prime Minister MacDonald has rejected the security formula proposed by France based on the annex to the Locarno Treaty. The annex stipulates the responsibilities of member states of the League of Nations in the event of war. The Paris Echo also says: Let MacDonald quickly conclude the Tripartite Treaty, because we are now going to have a very unpleasant dispute with Italy. It is time to stop.

<h3 id="e50">Strongly Oppose Return Instructions <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Finance Minister Plenipotentiary May Postpone Return to Country</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The government, disregarding the opposition of the Chief of Naval Operations, issued return instructions. A part of the Privy Council attaches great importance to this and has declared that when the treaty is concluded and inquired about, it will severely question why the compromise plan based on the American plan as the core was accepted, disregarding the opposition of the military authorities from the viewpoint of national defense. Furthermore, the Chief of Naval Operations, who opposed the content of the return instructions, has presented his views to the Emperor from the perspective of national defense and strategy. It has recently been decided to hold a meeting of military councillors. However, before the treaty is ratified after the plenipotentiaries sign it, the entire treaty must be inquired about by the Privy Council, and because of military relations, it must also be inquired about by the Military Advisory Council before it can be concluded. If the Military Advisory Council submits a report expressing absolute dissatisfaction with the military strength, the situation will be even more serious. Therefore, the government is in a considerable predicament and is currently vehemently demanding understanding from the military. ▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The Minister of Finance Plenipotentiary initially intended to return to the country alone due to the stagnation of the London Conference, and it was rumored that the preparations for the trip had been completed. However, due to the government's response to the American proposal, the public outcry was loud. If he returns to the country now, he will inevitably become the target of public criticism in the special parliament. In addition, since the government has recognized the American plan, negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States will be easier. Therefore, the return to the country has been postponed. However, since this response did not use the opinions of the Navy, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy may resign sooner or later.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: Judging from the current situation, there seems to be no reason not to approve the treaty after it is signed. However, since the military has stated that it is difficult to establish a national defense plan regardless of the battleships of the Washington Treaty or the auxiliary ships of the London Treaty, the Military Advisory Council, even if it inevitably acknowledges the reduction in military strength in the treaty for the sake of international amity, will improve military preparations outside the scope of the treaty regulations, such as aviation weapons, to make up for the deficiencies in military strength and establish a new national defense plan.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The Naval Shipbuilding Headquarters is carefully considering how to maintain the shipbuilding industrial capacity before the expiration of this disarmament agreement in 1935. It is rumored that it will establish an agreement with companies with excellent shipbuilding technology to build three vessels other than the restricted vessels in order to maintain their industrial capacity.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th: The surplus financial resources from disarmament will be approximately 80 million yuan per year for the next five years. The government plans to use most of it to reduce the burden on the people and part of it to strengthen the navy. However, how to allocate it has not yet been decided. In the future, a struggle for financial resources may occur with the Navy, and its trend is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Soviet Russian Government Prohibits Forced Organization of Cooperative Farms <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>▲Kokumin, Moscow, 3rd: The Soviet Russian Central Government has issued an order absolutely prohibiting the use of force to coerce farmers into organizing cooperative farms. However, cooperative farms that show signs of disintegration are granted special rights, such as tax exemptions, to maintain them. Stalin personally drafted a declaration, which stated briefly that recently, disregarding the fact that the time was not yet ripe, forcibly promoting the implementation of Soviet agricultural policy has already caused a major mistake. Today, we must have the courage to admit our mistakes and do our best to correct the various adverse effects. It also stated that the various organs within the party cannot only be proud of the number of cooperative farms that have been established, but must reorganize and consolidate those that have already been established. Since the local soviets have successively driven out wealthy farmers and reorganized state cooperative farms, the national agricultural areas have been unusually chaotic and have greatly hindered the sowing of grain seeds. Therefore, the Soviet government has repeatedly issued orders to stop the rapid advance, hoping to restore order slightly.</p>

<p>▲Kokumin, Sacramento, 3rd: One hundred and sixty U.S. Army Air Corps planes performed aerial maneuvers today under the review of Lieutenant General Gilmer. The scale of this maneuver is unprecedented on the Pacific coast. However, there will soon be a Pacific coastal port air defense grand maneuver, the scale of which will far exceed the current maneuvers. The maneuvers will simulate an offensive and defensive war to demonstrate their strength.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Melbourne, 4th: The Commonwealth Bank of Australia</p>
<p>will soon continue to ship 8 million pounds in cash. Since July 1st of last year, including this shipment, Australia has shipped out a total of 24.5 million pounds in cash. ▲Reuters, Canberra, Australia, 3rd: The Prime Minister of New South Wales, referring to the government's intention to adopt strict measures to reduce the import of luxury goods, said that goods currently in customs warehouses and on board connected vessels, not subject to surcharges, such as liquors, watches, textiles, felt, leather, and clothing made of cotton, silk, or artificial silk, or half wool and half other materials, are all luxury goods and must be subject to surcharges. This measure is an emergency measure by the government to reduce annual imports to 10 million pounds. ▲Reuters, New South Wales, 4th: The tax proposals announced by the government have caused public consternation. The public believes that the new plan to ban the import of certain luxury goods can rectify the current poor situation regarding overseas trade. However, it will inevitably lead to a large increase in unemployment in the distribution industry. ▲Reuters, Kubala, 4th: Since the Prime Minister announced the tax proposals yesterday, the customs has issued a detailed list of prohibited imports, including eggs, candies, dried fruits (except dates and figs), canned fruits, sauces, leather goods, leather, blankets (except carpets), and other items.</p>
<h3 id="e54">German New Cabinet Steadily Overcomes Difficulties <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>▲Kokumin, Berlin, 3rd: The German Brüning Cabinet has steadily overcome its first difficulty. The no-confidence motion proposed by the Social Democratic Party in the parliament was rejected by a vote of 253 to 187. The National Socialist Party members, after their leader Hugenberg declared that the party had decided to support the government, all voted for the government. Therefore, the difference in votes between the two sides was so great. Hugenberg's sudden change of attitude was due to the fear that forcing his party to oppose the new cabinet would lead to the defection of most of the party members. However, this move greatly damaged his own prestige. After he announced his attitude, opposition parties attacked him fiercely. However, most newspapers expressed their approval and hoped that the new Prime Minister would take this opportunity to resolve the various entangled financial issues. However, radical elements from both the left and right wings are still fiercely attacking the government. The new cabinet still faces many thorns in the road ahead.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd: The bill to reduce death penalty cases in the Army and Air Force passed through the examination committee in the House of Commons today. The amendment proposed by the Conservative Party that anyone who induces cowardly behavior in a companion should still be sentenced to death was rejected by the public, while the amendment proposed by the Labour Party to exempt military service evasion from the death penalty was passed. The original bill was a free vote in the House of Commons, so the passage of the Labour Party's amendment was not a failure for the government. From now on, only treason will be punishable by death.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Tianjin Haihe Committee Requests Maintaining the Original Plan for the Haihe Public Bonds <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Haihe public bonds were temporarily suspended from issuance due to an order from the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday (the 30th), the Haihe Dredging Committee discussed the matter and sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Yuan, stating that the matter concerned national bonds and should not be changed lightly. The telegram is quoted below: "Respectful salute to Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing. The telegram regarding the Haihe project, which concerns the prosperity of Tianjin and the livelihood of the people of Hebei, is extremely important. Since 1925, the upstream sources have dried up, with only the Yongding River experiencing floods and flowing into the Haihe River, causing increasing siltation and almost cutting off navigation. For a time, there were few ships in Tianjin, and all industries were in decline. The upstream rivers were also unable to discharge water smoothly due to the blocked outlet, leading to the Yongding River breach last year. Currently, the funds for the Yongding River embankment have not yet been allocated, and although the Haihe navigation has been temporarily restored, the Yongding River problem remains unresolved and may lead to future siltation. Considering the impoverished livelihood of the people and the desolate state of the market, this project cannot be delayed any longer. Furthermore, this case was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval in 1928, and the Legislative Yuan approved and promulgated the Short-Term Public Bonds Regulations for Dredging the Haihe River in Hebei Province, setting the amount at 4 million yuan. As for the organization of this committee, in addition to the representatives of the Haihe Engineering Bureau and the provincial and municipal governments, the central government agencies participating include two representatives each from the Ministry of Finance and the Construction Committee. In terms of funds, all income and expenditure of this committee, no matter how large or small, must be jointly signed by Chinese and foreign accountants, and the representatives of the Ministry of Finance are also involved in every detail. In terms of engineering, the representative of the Construction Committee serves as the director of the engineering committee of this committee, responsible for the planning. Therefore, the affairs of this committee are jointly supervised and responsible by representatives of the central government and foreign groups, and the original engineering plan has been used by the government to issue public bonds. The government authorities should not have repeated doubts and constraints. As the spring thaw approaches, this project is of great importance and should be actively and expeditiously carried out by the committee. It is hoped that the people of Hebei will not suffer from poverty and Tianjin will regain its prosperity, and that the government will not have the suspicion of being partial to one region over another in presiding over the overall national plan. Article 2 of the Public Bonds Regulations stipulates that the public bonds shall be issued by the Ministry of Finance and entrusted to the Haihe Dredging Committee for raising funds and spending according to the plan. Article 9 stipulates that the 20th of April and the 20th of October each year shall be the dates for principal and interest repayment. The first lottery last year was held in Peiping. This time, your ministry's telegram changed it to be held in the capital, and also stated that it could not be issued until the plan was approved. This committee believes that the Haihe public bond fund is collected from the 5% surtax on the value of goods at the Tianjin Customs, which is purely a surtax borne by Chinese and foreign merchants and has nothing to do with the national tariffs. All matters such as lottery and principal and interest repayment should be carried out in the local area to show great credibility. Article 7 of the regulations stipulates that the issuance date is April 21, 1929. More than a year has passed since the issuance, and one lottery has been held. It is difficult to stop it again and change the method. In short, this public bond regulation was formulated and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, and it should not be easily changed by order, and the case concerns the future of national bonds, and should not involve any partiality or damage national credibility. After repeated consideration, we can only appeal to you to consider the suffering of the people, the credit of public bonds, and the fact that this project cannot be delayed. Please cancel the method proposed in the telegram and conduct the lottery on schedule, still in Peiping, to comply with the original plan. A detailed engineering plan will be submitted separately, and the committee will inform the fund management committee that this fund is designated for the Haihe project and cannot be misappropriated by anyone. This telegram is hereby sent, hoping that you will review and handle it accordingly. [Stamp of the Haihe Dredging Committee] Attached are the original telegrams from the Ministry of Finance: (1) To the Tianjin Customs 2.5% Surtax National Treasury Bond Fund Management Committee, Hebei Province Haihe Dredging Committee, Banking Association, General Chamber of Commerce, and the China Traffic, Salt, JinCheng, Dalu, and Zhongnan Banks: The second principal repayment lottery for the Haihe public bonds, originally scheduled to be held in the capital on April 1, is now temporarily postponed due to a change in method. Please investigate. Song, Minister of Finance. (2) The second principal repayment for the Haihe public bonds has been scheduled to be held at the Nanjing General Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on April 1. Please send a representative to supervise the lottery. Please telegraph the name of the representative. Song You, Minister of Finance. (3) The first principal repayment lottery for the Haihe public bonds has been scheduled by this ministry to be held in the capital on April 1. However, according to the regulations, the public bonds were raised by your committee and spent according to the plan. Please prepare and submit the plan to the ministry for approval as soon as possible. It should not be issued before approval to ensure prudence. Please investigate and handle this matter. Song You, Minister of Finance."</p>
<h3 id="e72">Nishi Denies Japanese Troops Coming to Jinan <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Although the current situation is tense, this province is still peaceful. Yesterday, the Provincial Readjustment Committee held a weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Chairman He Siyuan reported that Nishi, the Japanese consul in Jinan, made a statement to the provincial government under the pretext of the current situation, stating that his government would send troops to Jinan to protect Japanese residents, which has been sternly rejected by the provincial government. The citizens of Jinan, who have all suffered the pain of the May 3rd Incident, were enraged upon hearing this news. However, according to Nishi's words to others, he did not formally negotiate with the government about Japan sending troops to Jinan. When he met with Chairman Chen a few days ago, he only talked about the provincial government having to take full responsibility for protecting Japanese residents in Jinan if the situation unfortunately changed. Chen said that there was absolutely no worry about the security of Jinan, so the general Japanese would send a company of troops from Tianjin to Jinan, but there was no such thing at all. I have formally instructed the Japanese Residents' Association that China is now unified, and a part of the war is not related to the overall situation. The nationals must strive for Sino-Japanese friendship and coexistence. Although Nishi's words are one-sided, they must be based on the views of his government, so I will record them to await the proof of the facts. (April 2)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Changes in Chen Hanzhang's Department in Hunan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>▲Chen Mozhang has died of his injuries.</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Chen Mozhang, the Second Garrison Commander of Hunan, was assassinated in Hongjiang on the 24th of last month, and shot in the abdomen. Li Guojun's regiment of Chen's department changed and occupied Hongjiang, which I have reported yesterday. I have heard that Chen Mozhang died a few days ago due to his serious injuries and ineffective treatment. Chen was originally a heroic leader of the bandits in western Hunan, with thousands of followers, occupying the border between Hunan and Guizhou provinces. In 1922, when Zhao Hengti was the governor of Hunan, he was recruited into the provincial army, initially serving as a regimental commander. Over the past eight or nine years, he has repeatedly changed his official title; Chen has always adhered to the principle of obeying orders but not being transferred, stationed in the Hongjiang area of Fuyuan in western Hunan for more than ten years, refusing to leave a step. His department was originally organized into four regiments: the first regiment was Chen Wo, the second regiment was Li Guojun, the third regiment was Xiong Pinjun, and the fourth regiment was Xiang Chengzhi. Later, due to orders for reorganization, the fourth regiment was cancelled, leaving only three regiments. The officers and soldiers were all from bandit backgrounds, and their biggest task was to protect and transport opium, so the officers and soldiers were very wealthy, so the local area was able to live in peace. Although the successive authorities of the Hunan provincial government knew that he was untamed, they gave him a corresponding title for the sake of temporary local tranquility, in order to control him. A week before the incident, He Jian received a secret report saying that someone in Li Guojun's regiment of Chen's department was colluding and was about to cause trouble, and secretly telegraphed Chen to be on guard. The next day, Chen replied to He's telegram, saying that he and Li were brothers in adversity and there was no other concern. After the incident, Li's regiment immediately advanced from Yuanzhou and occupied Hongjiang. After He Jian found out, Li Guojun was highly suspected of assassinating Chen. Except for Chen Wo's regiment, which is now in Anjiang, Xiong Pinjun's regiment had already arrived in Wugang, preparing to enter Guangxi. He Jian has now ordered Xiong's regiment to suspend its entry into Guangxi and be under the command of Chen Wo, and go to Hongjiang to quell the chaos, and ordered Chen Wo to temporarily serve as the brigade commander. (Chen's department has now been reorganized into the Independent Eighth Brigade.) It is feared that there will be a battle in Hongjiang soon. (April 2)</p>

<h3 id="e74">Zhu Mao Capture Various Counties in Southern Jiangxi <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>▲They have crossed Nankang and Dayu and invaded Guangdong.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhu Mao recently attacked Ganzhou, but was besieged by the Peng and Yu regiments and the Zhou, Xiao, and Yang regiments of Jin's division. Zhu's bandits were unable to withstand the attack and abandoned Ganzhou on March 22. They used a small part to cause trouble in Shangyou, Suichuan, and invade Yundu and Guoji to disperse the bandit suppression forces, while the majority fled from Nankang, Dayu, and Xinfeng to the border of Nanxiong and Sannan, peeking at the East River of Guangdong. The vanguard troops have already reached the Nanxiong border area of Guangdong. It is reported that the Guangdong army's Dai brigade and Wu regiment have opened to Nanxiong and Xinghua areas in northern Guangdong to carry out interception. However, when Zhu Mao fled south, there were no troops stationed on the border between Jiangxi and Guangdong. The counties they passed through suffered unbearable devastation. According to a telegram from the Nankang Court to the Higher Court, the county seat of Nankang was captured by Zhu's bandits last month, and the county government, court, party headquarters, and all public buildings were burned down by the communists, and the prisoners escaped completely. The county seat of Dayu was also lost at noon, the prisons were overthrown and the government was destroyed, and it was chaotic. The county magistrate of Dayu, Zhu Rulin, telegraphed to the province yesterday, saying that Jin's division had sent a team to chase them, and Xunwu, because it borders Fujian and Guangdong provinces, has always been a den of bandits. The scattered bandits in the county took the opportunity to respond and captured the county seat. The county magistrate, Hu Zehuan, escaped in advance. Later, the acting county magistrate, Hu Mengchun, led the Jingwei team to counterattack and killed the bandit leaders Liu Jiangxia and Zou Caichen on the spot, and beheaded them for public display, and regained the county seat. Other counties such as Xinfeng and Longnan are also extremely panicked and in a dangerous situation. The current situation is not yet known. As for Yichun in western Jiangxi, it was attacked by Peng Dehuai on March 24, and the county government, Qingxiang Bureau, and Finance Bureau were all burned down. The Civil Affairs Department received a telegram from the county magistrate of the county, Cai Shu, saying that Wang's regiment of Deng Yunshan's brigade arrived on the morning of the 26th, and the bandits were repelled and the county seat was recovered, and order has been restored. Zhang Huizan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province, led the headquarters to Zhangshu a few days ago. Because the scattered bandits along the Gan River were still rampant, he temporarily stationed in Xingan. Now the communists along the river from the province to Ji'an have been completely eliminated. Zhang then advanced from Jishui and stationed in Ji'an, directing everything, and telegraphed to Chairman Lu many ways to eliminate the banditry, such as clearing the countryside, providing disaster relief, and self-defense. Chairman Lu has adopted and implemented them. As for the Security Office established by the provincial government, it was formally established today. All newly established Jingwei Regiments, Police Brigades, Qingxiang Cadre Teams, and Radio Teams are under its jurisdiction. The Provincial Qingxiang Bureau, which was established earlier, was ended at the end of last month and handed over to the Security Office for takeover. (April 1)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Three Records of the Robbery in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: The case of robbery and kidnapping in Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, has been reported twice in this newspaper. I now know that the next day (2nd), the Jinshan County Government only sent a committee member to Zhangyan to investigate and ordered all pawnbrokers to seal up all the remaining clothes and jewelry and wait for discussions on how to deal with the aftermath. Shops such as Hengtai Xiang, Xiechang, and Yangguang Silk Shops were all searched, except for coarse cloth and Zhongshan cloth. The Nanhua shops used hemp bags to pack goods. Shuwange Silver Shop had already suffered huge losses last year, and this time it was searched by bandits several times, with no details spared. Dimao Rice Shop was robbed of dozens of stones of white rice. Since hearing the gunshots, the staff of Hengda Estate had all fled and hid. The manager and clerk, Mr. Xu and another person, feigned sleep in the dirty bedding of the old quartermaster and were not seen by the bandits. The iron box of the estate was strong, and the bandits used all their strength to knock on it. After two hours, they used all their strength to break the door and robbed 2,000 yuan in cash. They went upstairs to rummage through the boxes and cabinets. Seeing that there were no important items, they discarded them. Those residents who were robbed, such as Zhu Zhonghuang and the Yao family and more than ten households, only took cash, foreign currency, jewelry, and valuable leather clothes, but did not rob them. As for the earliest kidnapped person, Li Xinglin of Xiehe Pawnshop hid on the roof and was seen by the bandits with a flashlight and dragged down and taken away. In addition, those who were kidnapped were Fan Qirui of Yuanchang Clothing Store, Gu Jiesheng, Wang Jingbo, Sun Shuguan of Yitai Pawnshop, Mrs. Pan of Futairen, Shen Jingying, Shen Jingfang, Shen Wu Qingyan, Dai Lianfu of Jinlong, Zhu Xiangsheng, Dai Yunsheng, Wang Yulong's housewife, and girls, six of Zhu's family of seven, including Miss Senior, Miss Second, Miss Hua, Miss Asia, and Longguan, Wu Guihe of Hengfengchang, the housewife of Chen Yimao and her nine-year-old son, Jiang Weibin of Dingchang, and Huang Chenchu, the principal of the Liuxi School, and teacher Ling Jianming, etc. were taken to the Guandi Temple and separated. Well-known people such as Li Xinglin (who also serves as the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce) were slapped in the face because they did not tell their real names. The rest were judged by their clothes. It was heard that a certain storyteller and his wife were dressed gorgeously, and his wife was wearing a gold bracelet, which was almost mistaken for a wealthy family. After repeated explanations, their belongings were robbed and they were released. After the bandits finished questioning one by one, they said to the released people that they were quite disappointed that they had not been able to get to the god of wealth this time, and urged them to inform the family members of the hostages to raise money to redeem them, and there were many intimidating words. The Shanghai-Zhangyan ship was released because it had reached an agreement with the bandit leader Zhang Zhaohua. When the bandit leader was collecting the spoils in the Guandi Temple, the gang rules were strict, and it seemed that they were quite trained. However, the central banknotes were torn up. When the ship was about to leave, the bandit leader gave one dan of white rice, Shaoxing wine, ham, and other items, and then started the engine and returned. Seeing the bandit ship sailing towards Dianshan Lake, those with a little wealth in Zhangyan and nearby areas are now like frightened birds, and some have come to Songjiang to find a house to take refuge. Since Songjiang heard that Zhangyan was robbed by lake bandits, rumors spread for a while, and people were panicked, especially in the townships. The Jin County Governor immediately telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Command, requesting to send a team to Songjiang to increase defense. The 26th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division was sent to Songjiang on the 4th, and most of them were stationed at the headquarters. It is heard that tomorrow the companies will be assigned to Jinshan and Qingpu to suppress bandits and calm the area. Local communication.</p>

<p>President Lin of the Higher Court Requests an Increase in Prisoner Rations: President Lin of the Higher Court said that the price of rice has soared recently, and the original prisoner rations were set at 11 cents per prisoner per day, which is not enough to cover the costs. The wardens and prison officials of the counties have telegraphed to request an increase. After receiving the report, President Lin went to the province on the 3rd to attend yesterday's provincial government meeting, prepared a plan to increase the prisoner rations to maintain prison administration and avoid panic.</p>
<p>The Rampant Banditry in Various Townships in the County: According to bandit police reports, after the Yangsantaimiao Temple was burned down, the lake bandits fled to Weiting Fengli Village and Town. There are about 30 bandit ships, and the situation is very rampant. The district chief telegraphed to the province. More than ten bandit ships have also arrived at the Xinkai Road in Hengjing and are heading towards Wujiang. Fifteen bandit ships arrived in Chenmu Township yesterday (the 4th) morning and have been telegraphed to the County Bureau one after another. In addition to sending three platoons of police to Weiting to block them, Director Cao also reported to the Bandit Suppression Command and sent teams to Chenmu Xinkai Road and other places to search and suppress them. Also, Jin Guoshu, the acting magistrate of Changshu County, yesterday urgently reported that Yangsantaimiao Temple on the shore of Yangcheng Lake on the border of Suzhou and Changshu was burned down by the police team. Since then, the large gang of lake bandits has fled to the surface of Yangcheng Lake. He requested that a team be sent to assist in the suppression. After receiving the telegram, District Chief Gong immediately led a team of ships to search and suppress the area and requested the Bandit Suppression Command to send a team to assist in the suppression.</p>
<p>Request to Send Aircraft to Assist in Bandit Suppression: The Central Government previously ordered aircraft to be sent to Suzhou to assist the military and police in suppressing lake bandits.

<p>Abolition of Local Security on a Regular Basis: The District Chief's Association previously stated that the local security system was cumbersome and proposed to abolish it immediately. The County Council re-deliberated and approved the proposal to set up a town and village police officer for each map to take over all previous local grain and security duties. The implementation is still under the county government and supervised by the town and village offices. It has been decided to order compliance from April 20.</p>
<p>The Wu Family's Accounting Ship Was Robbed: The accounting ship of the late wealthy Wu family in Shenhang was anchored in front of the house by the river. Yesterday night (2nd), more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived, first tied up the shipworkers and prohibited them from making a sound, and then sailed towards Ruanxian Port. Later, neighbors heard about it and rushed to rescue them. A letter was found next to the shipworkers, signed by the Red Army, stating that the army needed ships and came to borrow them, and would return them within a month. It was also heard that there was a rifle and dozens of bullets on the ship, which were prepared for night defense. Now that there may be unforeseen circumstances in the future, the accounting house reported to the county today.</p>

<p>The Impact of the Fire Brigade Not Being Resolved: The fire brigades in Kunshan's districts, because of a conflict with the members of the Public Security Bureau during a previous fire, were ordered by the former County Magistrate Wu to be arrested. As a result, the fire brigades were unwilling to put out the fires in the area. Previously, various agencies such as the District Office and the County Party Headquarters had sent letters inviting the executive members of the Fire Brigade Association and representatives of the main members of the fire brigades in each district to hold a joint meeting, but it was still unresolved. At 6:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, a fire broke out at the Beixin Chang Winery Warehouse outside the Daxi Gate, causing a fire. At that time, police sirens and gongs sounded, but the fire brigades still refused to put out the fire. Fortunately, there were many people in the winery, and the fire was quickly extinguished.</p>

<p>Conscripting Labor to Build Roads: It is heard that the county is conscripting labor to build roads. The original road lines were four roads. Now, Director Sun of the Construction Department believes that there are too many roads in the county, and it is difficult to conscript labor. He ordered the county to build the Fuhe Road to facilitate transportation. All miscellaneous tasks such as the Yingzhen laborers and substitutes along the Miaojing Road and other three roads must be transferred to the construction of the Fuhe Road.</p>

<p>A large number of refugees arrived at Meiyuan: About three to four hundred male and female refugees from Jiangbei Funing and other places suddenly arrived at Meiyuan, a famous scenic spot in this county located in Kaiyuan Township, which is usually crowded with tourists every spring and autumn. The refugees seemed intent on causing trouble. The security guard at the park gate reported this to the Ninth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched police to suppress the situation, providing some travel expenses and escorting them out of the area.</p>
<p>Meeting on food relief for the people: Sun Zuji, the magistrate of this county, recognizing the recent soaring rice prices and the public's precarious food situation, specially convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the county government to discuss relief measures, inviting representatives from various government agencies, national bodies, and local gentry and wealthy individuals. The meeting focused on discussing ways to stabilize rice prices, suppress hoarding, and other solutions. Key resolutions were reached as follows: (1) Deciding on measures to implement price stabilization. It was resolved that the county government would supervise the district chiefs to actively solicit donations from the gentry and wealthy, with a deadline to collect the funds by the end of this month and report to the county government, after which price stabilization measures would be implemented regularly. Regarding the survey of civilian households, each district would supervise the township heads to conduct on-site investigations and verify registrations. (2) Planning to pre-order foreign rice futures to avoid procurement issues during emergencies. It was resolved that the Yicang Management Committee would immediately allocate 10,000 taels of silver from the accumulated losses to cooperate with local industry groups to purchase 1,000 tons of foreign rice for reserve. (3) Strictly prohibiting hoarding and speculation, and private export. It was resolved to investigate if people are hoarding, speculating, or privately exporting, and to allow people to report such actions at any time. A request was made to waive the feast tax. A dispute over the collection of the feast tax between the Wuxi County Education Bureau and the First District Office was recently resolved when the First District voluntarily conceded the tax collection to the Education Bureau. The Finance Department has ordered the county to submit the original case for review. However, Rongguan businesses, considering this case to be closely related to their industry, had previously submitted separate petitions to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting tax exemption. As no response had been received, the matter was brought up at the current County Chamber of Commerce Member Representative Assembly. It was argued that the fish, meat, seafood, sauces, wine, and oil used by these businesses are already subject to various taxes, and making Rong dishes, which are only for satisfying hunger, subject to another tax would be excessive. It was requested to grant an exemption from the feast tax, similar to the exemption granted by the Shanghai Special Municipality. The assembly unanimously passed the resolution, and the County Chamber of Commerce has recorded it and sent telegrams to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the three departments of Finance, Civil Affairs, and Construction, requesting that the county be ordered to exempt the businesses from the tax to alleviate their difficulties.</p>

They sent representatives to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Transportation for the abolition of the fees. The Ministry of Transportation approved an investigation and ordered a review, but the matter has been pending for half a year without resolution. With the arrival of the new Provincial Committee, representatives from various counties plan to re-petition to fundamentally resolve the issue. They gathered at the Zhenjiang Shipping Association and went to the Provincial Government today to petition.

The soldiers fired a warning shot, and the bandits returned fire with their Mauser pistols, hitting soldier Zhang Wenyi in the lower body. Hearing the sound, the soldiers inside prepared urgently. The ambushing bandits then surrounded them from all sides. The soldiers exited through the back door and fought bravely, but they were outnumbered and gradually overwhelmed. They temporarily retreated. The bandits then set fire to the two front rooms and one middle room of the group headquarters. By the time the provincial police and the district headquarters arrived, the bandits had fled.</p>

(4) Regarding the case of Ke Jie and ten other citizens of the Eleventh District, who accused Tan Dingyi, a police officer of the First Sub-station of the Public Security Bureau in that district, of malfeasance, corruption, and dereliction of duty, after investigation, the facts have been verified. The committee resolved to send a letter to the county government ordering the Public Security Bureau to promptly dismiss the police officer. A Bizarre Case of a Lost Daughter-in-Law: Lu Youxiang, a farmer from Xiwaihe Village near Zhujiajiao Town in Qingpu County, has two sons, Hongqing and Yunqing. Last spring, Hongqing married Zhou Maolong's daughter Xiugu from Sanwan Village. After the marriage, the couple did not get along well. Unexpectedly, Xiugu suddenly ran away last month without a trace. After losing his daughter-in-law, Lu ordered his son Yunqing to go to Shanghai to find her. The next day, Lu also went to Shanghai to search, but there was no news. On the way, he met his eldest son, Hongqing, who said that his sister-in-law had been found and was working as a maid in a mansion and would be able to return home at the end of the month. They might as well return home first. Unexpectedly, when the time came, Lu asked his eldest son, Hongqing, for money and went to Shanghai again the day before yesterday to urge his sister-in-law to return home. Hongqing returned to his hometown yesterday with his sister-in-law Xiugu. For some reason, his uncle, Shen Yinglin, suddenly detained him, suspecting that he had abducted and absconded, and sent him to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>

<p>District Heads Have Been Appointed: The Jiaxing County Government, during the fourth meeting of village representatives convened by the county government to divide districts, decided to divide the county into seven districts. Yesterday, the district heads of each district were appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs: Shang Baoshan, Mo Shancheng, Mei Shouren, Zhu Jipan, Wang Ziliang, Liu Shupang, and Pan Qinghua were appointed. After being appointed, the district heads will be sworn in as soon as the office locations are confirmed. The Farmers Bank Preparatory Office is Issuing Loans: Since the establishment of the Jiaxing Farmers Bank Preparatory Office, the opening date has been pending because the fund has not yet been fully funded. Now, Director Wu has submitted a request to the province to approve an allocation of 10,000 yuan to test the issuance of loans, as the silkworm season is approaching and farmers need funds. The lightest interest rate is taken, and each rural cooperative guarantees borrowing from the Farmers Bank Preparatory Office and re-lending it to farmers for their needs. Now that this news has spread, applications for loans from rural cooperatives have been pouring in. Director Wu believes that the planned 10,000 yuan is not enough to distribute, so he has submitted a request to the county government to forward it to the province for approval to continue allocating 5,000 yuan to increase the number of loans.</p>

<p>Bandit Atmosphere is Rampant in the County: Robberies and kidnappings in Jiashan County occur every day. Last night, the home of Li A'er in Nangu Village, Dingpeng District, was invaded by bandits, who carried out a looting spree. All the rice money, more than 270 foreign dollars, was completely robbed, and 37 piculs of white rice were also robbed by the bandits. The owner of the incident was also wounded in the right arm with a knife. Also, the home of Jin Xiaodi in Jinjiabin held a Buddhist ceremony last night and bandits broke in, looting wildly. The monks were bound and prevented from moving. Then they rummaged through boxes and chests, looting everything. The total loss of clothing was more than 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Yongfu West Village Closed Down: In the ferry robbery case on Qianjing Pond the other day, Wang Angru, the partner of Yongfu Village in Xitang, had 5,000 yuan looted.

Xitang's False Alarm for Three Days: District Chief Su Gongguoliang telegraphed District Chief Zhao, reporting that a large group of lake bandits had robbed Zhangyan and threatened to rob Xitang, requesting attention and ordering to block and defend. Su dispatched teams to pursue and suppress. District Chief Zhao immediately telegraphed Chen Boang, the eighth captain of Xitang, to pay close attention. On one hand he dispatched teams to rush West overnight to meet them. On the other hand, Xitang received the news and immediately closed the market. Many timid people fled to the city. Police and militia patrolled with live ammunition and the local situation was very tight.</p>

The piteous cries of the people are everywhere, and those seeking death in their families are not uncommon. Even those fortunate enough to wait for death can only eat elm bark once a day. Recently, a large number of refugees gathered and surrounded the county government, ready to riot. There are currently more than 30,000 people in urgent need of relief to survive, and about 10,000 households without seeds for autumn crops. The current situation is unsustainable, and a major disaster is imminent. A telegram was sent on behalf of all the people to the Chinese Health Society, the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Huayang Charity Relief Association, and other charitable organizations, requesting generous emergency relief to save the affected people. It is hoped that kind-hearted gentlemen, upon seeing this tragic situation, will not hesitate to contribute generously.</p>

<p>▲Orders All Counties to Encircle and Suppress Regardless of Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command, in response to the looting by lake bandits in Zhangyan Town and Hejingwan and other places in Jinshan County, has ordered the Second Company of the Artillery Battalion of the Fifth Division stationed in Longhua to be stationed in Songjiang to pursue and suppress the bandits. Yesterday, the Command also ordered the Third Battalion of the Twenty-sixth Regiment of the Thirteenth Brigade of the Fifth Division stationed in Longhua, led by Battalion Commander Zeng Yisheng, with the Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Third Companies, to depart from Longhua at 10:40 AM yesterday, traveling in eight passenger cars attached to the 22nd freight train from Shanghai to Hangzhou to Songjiang, separately to pursue and suppress the bandits.

The Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters has divided the counties along the lake, including Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujin, Changxing, Yixing, and Wujiang, into bandit suppression zones to carry out suppression. In order to fundamentally eliminate bandits, if lake bandits infiltrate this garrison area in the future, they should be temporarily encircled and suppressed in cooperation with local military and police, regardless of jurisdiction.

In addition to separate orders, you are hereby urgently ordered to comply with and instruct all subordinates to comply."</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Strives to Stabilize Rice Prices <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>▲30,000 Picul of Rice Stored in Heshang</p>
<p>▲Must Fall by Two Yuan Within Ten Days</p>
<p>▲Order to Report Rice Hoarding According to Regulations</p>
<p>▲Rice Prices in Rice Shops Must Be Made Public</p>
<p>According to Wuchen News Agency, rice supplies have gradually increased in recent days, and prices in the interior have also stabilized. There is a gradual hope of rice prices falling. Yesterday, the highest grade of white rice opened at 19.5 yuan, but due to the unsatisfied desires of a few rice merchants who colluded with each other, prices have remained high. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to the situation. Yesterday, in addition to continuing to send personnel to the north and south markets to investigate and advise, it strictly ordered the rice industry associations to comply with the previous order to reduce rice prices by two yuan within ten days and not to obstruct it secretly. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲More than 20,000 Picul of Rice Stored in the North Market: The Bureau sent personnel to meet with Jiang Shizhi, the Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai North Rice Grain Marketing Association, and found that more than 200 rice boats were docked in Heshang, carrying tens of thousands of picul of rice. The current price of Changshu's top-grade rice is 19.5 yuan, which is 50 cents less than yesterday. The market is continuing to decline, so the general marketers and boatmen are still holding high prices and refusing to sell. They should sell all the rice according to the market price immediately. If they continue to wait, it will be enforced. The same warning was also given to the Changshu Rice Merchants Association.</p>
<p>▲Sixty Rice Boats in the South Market: A total of 31 rice boats arrived in the past two days, and the total number of rice boats accumulated in the past few days has reached 64, carrying 8,002 picul of rice. Most of them are self-selling boats, totaling 19 boats carrying 2,655 picul of rice. Chen Qinji and Zhang Chengji each have 8 boats with more than 1,900 picul of rice. Yan Xiaoji has 9 boats with 1,210 picul of rice. In addition, marketers each have several hundred picul. As of last night, none of the above rice had been sold. The Social Affairs Bureau selected those who insisted on not selling and warned them. If they still do not sell, there will be appropriate measures to execute.</p>
<p>▲Strict Order to Warn Rice Merchants: The Social Affairs Bureau has learned of various tricks from merchants, so it has ordered various rice industry groups to state that the Bureau previously stipulated that the highest white rice price would be temporarily limited to 20 yuan and ordered it to be reduced by two yuan within ten days. It has been found that the number of rice boats in Heshang has not decreased recently, and the rice that has not been sold is more than 10,000 picul every day. The market in the producing area has also declined, and the rice price should have fallen, but it is still high. It is clear that someone is manipulating it. After investigation, it was found that some rice merchants have greed and colluded with rice merchants in the producing areas to deliberately hold back sales and prevent rice from being shipped to Shanghai and sent important personnel to Wuxi and other places to negotiate a large-scale manipulation plan. It has also been heard that Hakka rice dealers have also telegraphed overseas producing areas to temporarily stop shipping to see what the market will do. Furthermore, unscrupulous merchants are falsely claiming to be transporting grain and exporting it. Although the above information is based on rumors, it is not without reason based on the local rice market situation. The Bureau is concerned day and night about maintaining the food supply for 2.7 million people, but a few rice merchants are disregarding the overall situation and arbitrarily disrupting it. The Bureau hereby reorders the association to inform the industry not to repeat the old practices, to only seek private interests, to disregard the people's livelihood, and to harm public order. It is still important to strictly abide by the previous order and reduce the price of each picul of rice by two yuan within ten days and be responsible for clearing the source of the producing area and not secretly obstructing it. If there is still a refusal to sell, the Bureau will only take the interests of the majority as its own interests and execute appropriate measures. This is not a forewarning. The order is urgent.</p>
<p>▲Order to Report Rice Hoarding: The Social Affairs Bureau has repeatedly sent personnel to find that various rice companies have a large amount of rice stored but do not report it. There are also times when rice is stored in the interior but not shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, it has issued a notice to various rice industry groups, stating that the regulations for the public hoarding of rice require that the hoarding of rice be registered with the Bureau. All hoarding merchants should strictly comply with it to avoid accusations and to maintain the people's food supply. However, it has been found that various rice merchants have delayed in complying and there are still private hoarding situations. The associations must inform their industry to report all the rice stored in each warehouse by the 8th of this month. The rice stored in this warehouse should also be reported every day for the Bureau's investigators to take to the Bureau for verification. If there is any concealment, once it is found, it will be reported to the mayor and severely punished for hoarding and disrupting the people's food supply.</p>
<p>▲Order to Publicly Set Rice Prices: The sale of rice by rice shops is directly related to consumers. Recently, the rice market has been chaotic and a few rice merchants have taken the opportunity to profit. Therefore, it is ordered that the Jiagu Public Office state that the Public Office has previously negotiated and announced rice prices on a daily basis, and all the industry followed the prices for sale to avoid market chaos. The law is very good and should be restored in the current situation of high rice prices to stabilize market prices and benefit the people's livelihood. The Public Office is ordered to comply with this order and from the date of receipt of the order, it will publicly discuss the prices of first, second, and third grade japonica and indica rice every day and notify all members of the industry to comply, and publish it in the newspaper and report the compliance. The order is urgent.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, these three steamers arrived in Shanghai from Hankou. The Jiangyu steamer, released by the Communications Department, also arrived at the same time. The Sanbei Company's Xin Ningxing steamer also sent a telegram yesterday stating that it had departed from Hankou and was expected to arrive today. The Yongxing steamer of the Ning Shao Company also went downriver to Shanghai last night. It is found that six Chinese steamers arrived in the Yangtze River in one day, and all can be ordered to operate, but the goods loaded on each ship are very scarce.</p>
<p>Order to Collect Rental Fees. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from the Communications Department of the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stating that the unpaid rent, coal, and river fees owed to the shipping companies last year have now been fully received.

However, since the previous receipts issued by the companies were temporary civilian receipts and did not comply with the reimbursement regulations, a standardized invoice has now been prescribed. It is necessary to extract the amount of payments received by each company in May, August, September, October, and November of last year, fill them in, and bring them to Nanjing along with the charter agreements and seals in order to clear all the ship rental payments. Yesterday, various companies were rushing to prepare detailed invoices for the collection of fees and were preparing to send representatives to Nanjing within the next two days to collect the funds.</p>

<p>Lama Geshe Dorje Jigme, who was invited by the Buddhist Association of Chengdu, Sichuan to give lectures, and who brought a large number of Buddhist images and scriptures with him, has traveled south from Beiping by sea and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The Shanghai Buddhist Association has publicly nominated him to promote Buddhism and will welcome him upon his arrival in Shanghai. He will stay in Shanghai for about three or four days before transferring to a Yangtze River ship to enter Sichuan. The primary reason the authorities in Sichuan have invited Geshe Lama to the province is to ask him to persuade the Living Buddha of Tibet to lean inward and accept the rule of the National Government, and not to be misled by the Mongolian Youth Party. Therefore, when Geshe Lama traveled south through Pingjin, the Sichuan Provincial Government specifically telegraphed instructions to all locations along the route to provide him with special treatment, free transportation by land and water, and escorts along the way, to show their respect.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Municipal Government Compiles Budget for the 19th Year <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲Organizing the Budget Committee to Begin Discussion</p>
<p>▲Efforts Will Be Made to Economize on Both Regular and Temporary Expenses</p>
<p>The Xin Shanghai News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government has been established for nearly three years. In the past 16th year, the total actual revenue was more than 3.54 million yuan, and the actual expenditure was more than 3.36 million yuan. Although there was a surplus on the books, more than 600,000 yuan was owed in temporary expenses. The revenue budget for the 17th year was more than 3.37 million yuan, of which more than 600,000 yuan was directly spent by the municipal treasury, and the rest was used to cover the regular needs of each bureau. Various temporary expenses were not included. Fortunately, after taking over the urban area, revenue increased sharply. The actual revenue was more than 4.275 million yuan, and the actual expenditure also reached more than 4.396 million yuan. The balance of revenue and expenditure showed a shortfall of more than 112,000 yuan. Together with the unpaid expenses of various departments, there was a total shortfall of more than 600,000 yuan. The revenue budget for the 18th year was more than 5.05 million yuan, and the expenditure was more than 5.06 million yuan. Temporary expenses were not included. It is heard that when compiling the previous budget, it was originally intended to allocate a reserve fund to cover temporary needs. However, due to the development of the business of each department, it was insufficient to allocate, so the old figures were used as regular expenses, and temporary revenue was used to supplement temporary expenses. However, on the expenditure side, since the budget was announced, additional expenses have been added one after another due to business development, totaling more than 190,000 yuan. As the year has not yet ended, it is difficult to investigate the financial situation of the whole year. However, it is heard that the total report for this year shows a shortfall of more than 160,000 yuan. It is difficult to clear all regular expenses, but there is a huge amount of more than 180,000 yuan in unpaid temporary expenses. As for the situation in the second half of the year, on the revenue side, no new taxes have been added. Under the land tax item, the North Expedition donation has been canceled, resulting in a reduction of more than 80,000 yuan. The accumulated housing rent has been collected, and there is no increase in revenue. The only item that has the hope of increasing revenue is the ship tax. On the expenditure side, regular expenses have continued to increase, and the temporary expenses that have been approved total about 200,000 yuan. By the end of the year, they will also be considerable. Therefore, it can be predicted that the financial situation in the second half of the year will be tighter than in the first half of the year. Now, with the beginning of the 19th year approaching, the Municipal Government has organized a budget committee to start discussion on April 1. The budget for the 19th year will be carefully considered to correct the mistakes of the past. Efforts will be made to economize on regular expenses, and special attention will be paid to temporary expenses. The Finance Bureau, due to the establishment and implementation of the budget, is responsible for the lifeline of the city's operations and has appointed Xu Dun, the chief of the Third Section, to preside over everything.</p>

<p>Detailed Report on the Robbery of the Shanghai-Zhangyan Steamer</p>
<p>▲ The Steamer Returned to Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ The Purser Was Kidnapped and Released</p>
<p>Zhangyan Town in Jinshan County, approximately 180 miles from Shanghai, was suddenly looted by bandits on Tuesday evening this week. They first robbed the town's Public Security Bureau and security corps of their firearms, and then proceeded to loot shops and residences. Larger pawnshops, jewelry stores, and foreign goods shops were all affected, resulting in incalculable losses. Furthermore, over fifty male and female students were kidnapped, and two members of the security corps were killed. The details have already been recorded in the important news section of this newspaper. However, after the bandits kidnapped people and property, the Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer "Shanghai-Zhang" of the Shanghai-Zhangyan Shipping Bureau on Beijing Road happened to be sailing from Shanghai to Zhangyan. When it docked at the riverbank, the bandits noticed it and boarded to loot it. They also ordered the crew to start the fire and towed over thirty bandit boats carrying the kidnapped male and female students and items such as gold, silver, and valuables, along with over three hundred bandits, to the Guanwang Temple, about eighty miles from the town. Zhang Zongling and Wang Qingming, the pursers of the Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer, were also kidnapped and held for a night until around 11:00 AM the next morning when the bandit leader ordered them to be released, allowing them to escape danger. At the same time, twenty or thirty of the kidnapped male and female students were also released and returned to the town on the steamer. The Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, recording the incident of encountering bandits, being robbed, and being forced to tow boats in this manner.</p>
<p>▲ The Shanghai-Zhangyan Steamer Encounters Bandits</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer set sail at 8:00 AM on Tuesday (i.e., April 1st), heading straight for Zhangyan Town. There were over a hundred passengers and some cargo on board. At around 4:00 PM, it arrived at Zhangyan and docked between Anmin Bridge and Lime Kiln. Passengers disembarked one after another, and the cargo was also unloaded at the same time. The crew was sweeping the deck, preparing to rest until around 5:30 PM when they were about to boil water for dinner. Suddenly, gunshots were heard in the air, coming closer from a distance. The crew could not help but be greatly alarmed. Members of the security corps on the shore stated that there were thirty or forty civilian boats coming in the water, which they suspected were bandits, and they had ordered a curfew, prohibiting passage on the river surface at night. Before long, the bandit boats had sailed straight in, mooring from Anmin Bridge to Lime Kiln, blocking the Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer at both ends. At this time, the purser's room had already learned of the robbery in the town and knew that they would not be spared if the bandits came. Therefore, the entire ship prepared for defense, planning a retreat.</p>
<p>▲ The Purser Disguises Himself as a Tea Boy</p>
<p>Zhang Zongling and Wang Qingming, the pursers of the steamer, were quick-witted in a crisis. They handed the keys to the accounts cabinet to the tea boy, removed their long gowns, disguised themselves as servants, and waited quietly for the bandits to arrive. A few minutes later, two bandits boarded the ship and entered the cabin. Seeing Zhang Zongling, they asked, "What kind of person are you? Are you the purser?" Zhang replied that the purser had already gone ashore and that he was a tea boy. The bandits looked at him several times and said nothing more. They then entered the purser's room and robbed over forty dollars in banknotes. After a while, three more bandits came to search before leaving the ship. Around 6:00 PM, a sudden influx of bandits, all speaking with a northern accent, acted rudely, wielding various weapons such as Mauser pistols. They forced the captain to start the fire and set sail. The crew, forced by the bandits' intimidation, had no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>▲ Towing Boats Like a Long Serpent</p>
<p>There were a total of thirty-four bandit boats, each carrying seven, eight, or more than ten bandits. The kidnapped male and female students and villagers were hidden under reed mats. Zhang Zongling, the purser of the Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer, was also kidnapped onto a small boat. Thus, the bandit boats were connected like a long serpent, being towed by the steamer. Because there were too many boats being towed, the progress was very slow along the way. The bandits became impatient and often spoke harshly to the captain and threatened him with guns. After being told that there were too many boats and too much weight, making it impossible to speed up, the bandits reluctantly fell silent. They set off from Zhangyan at around 6:00 PM on the 1st and arrived at the Guanwang Temple at around 6:00 AM the next morning. The journey from Zhangyan was only about eighty miles, but it took twelve hours, showing how slow the progress was.</p>
<p>▲ Dividing the Spoils at Guanwang Temple</p>
<p>The boats arrived at Guanwang Temple and stopped. The bandits escorted all the hostages ashore one by one, and carried boxes and baskets, removing all the stolen goods such as gold, silver, valuables, clothes, and utensils. They transported them to the open space in front of the Guanwang Temple and temporarily stored them there. The bandit leader set up an incense table, burned incense, and silently prayed before dividing the spoils on the spot. Various stolen goods were piled up separately, such as gold and silver jewelry in one pile and clothes in another pile. The kidnapped men and women were also divided into teams and the bandit leader carefully inquired about their family backgrounds and looked at their clothing to decide who to keep and who to release. Those kept were escorted back to the bandit boats, and those released were temporarily held in the open space. The bandits divided the spoils, taking the silver and getting the gold, silver utensils were thrown away and ignored, and gold utensils were cherished and stored carefully. The value of gold over silver has increased further. At noon, the purser of the Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer, who had been kidnapped, begged the bandits to release the boat so that it could resume business. The bandits initially refused but finally agreed after much pleading. So, they left Guanwang Temple at around 11:00 AM that morning and returned to the town. Before leaving, the bandits sent over thirty hostages back to the steamer to be taken back to Zhangyan. The crew of the Shanghai-Zhangyan steamer felt as if they had been reborn and celebrated with joy. The steamer sailed to the Chuanlai Temple area in Songjiang and met the Shen-Zhang steamer that was sailing from Shanghai to Zhangyan. They transferred the more than thirty hostages who were released to the other boat to return to Zhangyan, while the Shanghai-Zhangyan went straight to Shanghai and arrived safely. This morning, it resumed sailing to Zhangyan.</p>

<p>▲ Suddenly Produces Breast Milk</p>
<p>Lu, the 36-year-old wife of Huang Amao, a farmer from Huangjiazhai, about four miles southwest of Yangxing in Baoshan, has been married to Huang for eighteen years. When Lu was 24 years old (i.e., in 1918), she conceived and gave birth to a son, who unfortunately died before his first birthday. After Lu's grief, she developed an internal illness and has not conceived since. But last month, Lu's period suddenly stopped, and the whole family was overjoyed, believing that she was undoubtedly pregnant. Unexpectedly, Lu suddenly felt her breasts swelling and producing milk a few days ago, which greatly alarmed her. She told her husband, Huang Amao, who then consulted a doctor. But after the doctor diagnosed Lu, he found that she had no illness and verified that the liquid flowing from Lu's breasts was indeed milk. After the news spread, nearby farmers rushed to see it, all considering it a strange event. Soon after, a relative of Huang's, named Zhang, brought his three-month-old infant to Huang's house to be breastfed by Lu. The infant has been drinking the milk for a day and a night now, and the situation is quite good, with no signs of any problems. This kind of special physiological anomaly is truly remarkable.</p>

<p>▲ Fourteen Men and Women Arrested</p>
<p>▲ Accomplices Captured in Zhabei</p>
<p>On the 25th of last month, over ten bandits armed with weapons broke into the home of Wang Shunjin, the owner of the Tongshengxing Machine Factory at No. 533 Gongping Road, Yangshupu. They first robbed him of 106 yuan in cash and then kidnapped Wang's three-year-old son, Xiasheng, and fled. After being robbed, the victim rushed to report to the police station and requested an investigation. The day before yesterday, detectives from the Huishan Police Station discovered that Wang's child was being held in a house at No. 644 Xinzha Road. Western and Chinese detectives armed with weapons rushed to surround the bandit's den, then entered and searched it. In addition to rescuing the hostage, they also captured fourteen individuals, including the bandits Jia Kuizhi, Li Zhaozhen, Yang Sihu, Chen Lidian, Chen Lilan, Wang Laowu, Ji Sha, Wang Jiajiu, Zhou Guanqing, Sun Chenghuai, Wang Maozheng, as well as Jia's wife, Jia Jiang, Zhou's wife, Zhou Shen, and Sun's wife, Sun Yuan. They were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Feng Shide conducted the interrogation. According to the police station's lawyer, there were still accomplices in this case who had been captured by the Zhabei Public Security Bureau. It was necessary to send detectives to transfer them and investigate everything. Therefore, he requested an extension. Judge Feng questioned each of the defendants briefly and ordered them to remain detained separately, with the hearing rescheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Prevalence of Seasonal Diseases in Shanghai <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>▲ High Mortality Rates for Smallpox and Meningitis</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health cited the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's spring report, which listed smallpox and epidemic meningitis as diseases with high mortality rates. The current season is the most prone to epidemics. The Ministry requested the Municipal Government to instruct the Health Bureau to strengthen preventive measures in order to prevent transmission. The Municipal Government then instructed the Health Bureau to comply. According to the Bureau's response, the smallpox patients discovered in the spring were entirely impoverished residents. The Bureau, aware of this, has launched city-wide smallpox vaccinations in the shantytowns. However, due to traditional customs, the common people are not receiving vaccinations in large numbers. Despite repeated explanations, progress is still difficult. As for the occurrence of epidemic meningitis, it is feared that it was introduced by carriers (those who carry infectious bacteria without showing symptoms). This is because the disease has already been epidemic in neighboring Songjiang, Baoshan, and other areas near Shanghai. Due to the heavy traffic in Shanghai, the occurrence of the disease due to carriers is unavoidable. In addition to promptly isolating patients with meningitis, the Bureau has also been distributing various leaflets about the disease at any time and injecting groups and individuals with meningitis preventive vaccines to prevent its spread and stop the epidemic.</p>

<p>In Wusong, the number of people infected with meningitis has been increasing daily recently. For preventive purposes, the 8th District Party Department consulted with the Municipal Health Bureau to send personnel to administer meningitis vaccinations at the department. Yesterday, a notice was posted stating that vaccinations for the public were free of charge. It was also learned that Chen Shiqi, a weaver at the Yong'an Cotton Mill, had a three-year-old child who was also infected with the disease. Dr. Jiang Yisheng, a doctor at Tongji University, diagnosed him and said that his fever was very high and dangerous. He was then sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>▲ Yesterday's Trial at the French Concession Court</p>
<p>▲ Each Bandit Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>The China-France Construction Company at No. 653 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession was previously broken into by bandits, who stole 4,500 yuan and fled. Afterwards, the French police paid special attention to this case and posted a reward for their arrest. The French police's special task force, consisting of detective inspector Jin Jiulin, detectives Wang Rusong, Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, and informants Zhou Yaoting, Zhang Ziying, and Zhou Buguang, discovered the whereabouts of the notorious thieves Song Xiaoliuzi, also known as Song Zhenglou, and Chen Yonggui. They immediately went to arrest them. Song and Chen, as well as four accomplices, Wang San and Chen Asi, and the female thief Song Zeng, were all arrested. Two Mauser pistols, two handguns, and a pair of handcuffs were confiscated and taken to the police station. After further investigation, the detectives discovered that Song and his gang had previously robbed the home of Lin Zhou at No. 61 Tongkang Lane, Mintineiyin Road, the cigarette and paper store opened by Wang Fusheng at No. 353 Caishi Road, and the leather shoe store opened by Zhou Fukang on Luban Road. They also assassinated Wang Xinfa at No. 149 Mintineiyin Road last year, kidnapped Zhang Zukang, who lived at No. 379 Mayerxi'ai Road in the French Concession, and hid him in the Caojiadu area. They had also committed multiple kidnapping and assassination cases in the Public Concession. After the police chief provided detailed confessions, the men were sent to the French court yesterday for trial. First, Western Inspector Sachiel presented the situation, along with the handguns and Mauser pistols. Then, the plaintiffs, Wang Fusheng, Zhou Fukang, Wang Linpei, and the woman Lin Zhou, filed complaints about the robbery. Song Xiaoliuzi confessed that he was from Jiangbei, 33 years old, and had been working as a laborer. In October of the previous year, Wang Are, who was at large, initiated the robbery at No. 61 Tongkang Lane. On December 20 of the previous year, Jin Changfa initiated the robbery at the cigarette and paper store on Caishi Road, obtaining 60 yuan. On July 2 of the previous year, Wang Linfa asked civilians to avenge his foster father, Liu Lianghong, and assassinated Wang Xinfa upstairs at No. 149 Mintineiyin Road. Afterwards, Wang Linfa gave each of them 50 yuan. On December 30 of the previous year, Wang Laowu, Jin Laosan, and others initiated the robbery at the China-France Company, obtaining over 4,000 yuan. Afterwards, each civilian received 500 yuan. On February 11 of this year, they robbed the leather shoe store opened by Zhou Fukang on Luban Road. On March 16, he was arrested by the police. Chen Yonggui confessed that he was from Zhenjiang and had been a tailor for the Hongbang gang. On February 11, Wang Laowu asked civilians to go to the leather shoe store on Luban Road to rob it. Afterwards, each civilian received 5 yuan. He knew nothing about the other cases. Wang San confessed that Song Xiaoliuzi had brought the handgun to him to hide, wrapped in paper, so he did not know it was a dangerous item. Chen Asi confessed that someone surnamed someone he knew had told him about the kidnapping of Zhang Zukang, but he was not actually present at the scene. Song Zeng confessed that her husband, Song Xiaoliuzi, was a thief outside, which she knew nothing about, and asked for leniency. Judge Zhu Cheng obtained the confession and, with the approval of French Consul Duna, sentenced Song Xiaoliuzi and Chen Yonggui each to five years in a Western prison and deportation, to be handed over to the mainland authorities for trial. Chen Yonggui will be sent to the Public Concession for questioning first. Wang San will be imprisoned for three years and deported, then sent to the Public Concession for questioning.

<p>At around 7:00 PM the night before last, over thirty large sand boats filled with pirates suddenly arrived at Lusi Port outside Wusong Port. They immediately began to loot the merchant ships anchored in the port, sparing none. They then proceeded to land and attack the local Public Security Bureau to seize firearms. Because the bandits came suddenly and were outnumbered, they were unable to resist. As a result, all the firearms were seized by the bandits, increasing their power. They then proceeded to search the shops and homes of the residents. After receiving the report, Director Wu of the Wusong Maritime Patrol immediately dispatched the Jingxing and Yisheng gunboats to suppress the pirates. Zhu Bingzheng, the district chief of the water police, has also dispatched the 17th Brigade to intercept them.</p>

<p>▲ Limit of Ten Packages for Cotton Textiles</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities issued a notice stating, "This is a notice regarding the matter that the Bureau has previously announced a ban on the transportation of bulk goods on city ferries. This is because city ferries are primarily for passenger transport, and the transportation of flammable goods is restricted by the water insurance regulations, which is unavoidable. The intention is to maintain the safety of both the ferry itself and the passengers and goods. However, it is inconvenient to ban passengers from carrying cotton textiles, such as lace, which they rely on for clothing and food, when traveling on the ferry. After consulting with the insurance company, an agreement has been reached to allow a limited number of such items to be carried, but each trip will be limited to ten packages. The packages must be tightly wrapped to prevent them from catching fire easily. Goods that are easily flammable, such as cotton, are still prohibited from being carried. This notice is hereby issued for public information."</p>

The following resolutions were made: (1) If the landlord agrees not to force tenants to move out, the tenants will be ready to pay the outstanding rent, but there must be adequate security; (2) If the landlord incurs losses due to house repairs, water rate increases, etc., a comprehensive calculation can be made. If there are indeed losses, the tenants are also willing to moderately increase the rent; (3) If the landlord insists that the tenants must move out, the tenants will suffer huge losses, estimated at over 300 yuan per household. If the landlord can compensate for the losses, the tenants will reluctantly make a final concession; (4) If the landlord does not follow the above three methods, all the tenants will, no matter how oppressed, vow not to move; (5) The current representative of the landlord, Zhang Xingbei, and the tenants publicly request the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Xu Xiuting, to mediate. All tenants are awaiting the fair judgment of the two representatives. The final decision rests with all the tenants. The above methods were put to a vote by the chairman and passed unanimously.

The bureau dispatched detectives to work with the relevant police station, and Wang and Ye were temporarily detained for interrogation. A long time has passed, and there has been no official request for extradition from Taixing County. According to the police station's investigation, the two men have been working in the Gungda workshop for quite some time and have no history of illegal activities. Moreover, Wang Daliu has never used the name Mao Yubo. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Special District Local Court held a hearing. After hearing the reports from Chinese and foreign detectives, Ye Kesong insisted in court that Wang Daliu was indeed the murderer present at the scene and that Taixing County had already issued an arrest warrant. As for Ye Deqing, he was not present at the scene. Wang Daliu denied being Mao Yubo and claimed that he had been working as a cook in the Shanghai cotton mill workshop for a long time, had never left Shanghai, and had never murdered Lin Wenhan. Ye also denied any illegal activities. The lawyers representing the two defendants presented their defense.

<p>Wei Guoan, 27 years old, from Wuxian, who used to weave silk, lives in Jiande New Village, Sanyang Road, Zhabei. On the evening of March 28th, Zhou Dazhen's house, No. 10 in front of Wei's residence, was reported to have had five or six pieces of clothing stolen. The next day, the incident was reported to the local Public Security Bureau sub-station for investigation. Suddenly, a man claiming to be a detective named Chen Ruzhen, suspecting Wei Guoan, arrested Wei and subjected him to various forms of private torture, resulting in injuries all over his body. However, Wei consistently denied the accusations. The detective had no choice but to release Wei and send him home. Having suffered this humiliation, Wei hired lawyer Wu Deyuan and filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Chen Ruzhen, Zhou Dazhen, and others of falsely accusing him of theft and subjecting him to private torture. The court approved the request, and yesterday ordered the judicial police to bring Chen Ruzhen, Zhou Dazhen, and others to the court for a preliminary hearing, along with the plaintiff Wei Guoan. After the investigation, the prosecutor determined that Chen Ruzhen did indeed commit private torture by hanging. Chen Ruzhen was immediately detained and taken into custody pending prosecution.

<h3 id="e144">Jin Ding Factory Resolves Dispute <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>This is to express our deep gratitude. Recently, due to the Jin Ding Factory's sudden closure and the dispersal of its workforce, the issues of resettlement and compensation were successfully resolved with the mediation of Mr. Wu Zhen and the testimony of lawyer Zhu Xiuchu. The family of the deceased worker, You Cheng, represented by his elder brother You, signed an agreement acknowledging the receipt of a total of 1,500 yuan for compensation and funeral expenses, thus resolving the matter. In addition to jointly submitting reports to higher authorities for record, the workers of our association are also satisfied. From now on, labor and capital will be separate, each pursuing their own livelihood. We express our heartfelt gratitude and offer this as a token of remembrance. In addition, we would also like to acknowledge Mr. Cheng Ziqing of the French Police Station. Due to a misunderstanding, our association's previous publicity material stated that Mr. Cheng personally directed the shooting that led to the death, but after repeated investigations, our association has found that Mr. Cheng Ziqing was not involved. We apologize for the damage to Mr. Cheng's reputation and will not send a separate letter of apology. The rest omitted.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association yesterday sent a letter to various factories, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, stating: 'We have received a letter from the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that the ministry, upon the order of the Executive Yuan, is conducting a nationwide survey and statistics of workers' living conditions and industrial production. The various preparatory works have been completed separately, and personnel will soon be dispatched to designated areas to begin on-site surveys to compile statistics on schedule. As the matter is important, we seek detailed information. In addition to the materials reported by the surveyors, we will collect various relevant materials from various countries for comparison and detailed analysis. In addition to sending separate letters, we enclose materials and request the collection of various materials as much as possible and submit them to the department before June of this year.' In addition, a table of the scope of material collection was sent to the meeting. At the 41st Standing Committee meeting on the 13th of this month, it was resolved to distribute the materials to various industry groups for collection and transmission. We hereby enclose a copy of the letter and the table of the scope of material collection and request that you check and promptly collect and submit the relevant materials within May so that we can transmit them. We earnestly look forward to your cooperation.' We are forwarding the enclosed table of the scope of material collection and request that your factory provide detailed information on the relevant materials so that we can compile them.

<h3 id="e146">Establishment of Police Station at Yujidun to Dredge the River <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Yujidun in West Shanghai is located on the upper reaches of the Wusong River. The river section is extremely silted, and it is a necessary area for various commercial and cargo ships on the inland river. Congestion and breakages often occur, especially for rice boats, which are most affected. Each time there is a breakage and dredging, it costs a lot of manpower and money, often taking more than ten days to pass. The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team has now established a police station at this place, with two patrol chiefs, Wang and Tian, and more than twenty police officers stationed in the Yuji Temple, specializing in dredging the river and managing traffic. In addition, since there are no pedestrians in the area after sunset, and gunshots are sometimes heard, it is extremely desolate and dangerous. In order to maintain the safety and tranquility of merchants and travelers, the Public Security Bureau will raise funds in the second half of the year to build police housing on Yujidun to expand its strength in order to have a high vantage point and comprehensive defense. A few days ago, the river section from Jiwang Temple to Zhangjiajing was again blocked. Patrol Chiefs Wang and Tian supervised eight police officers and worked hard to dredge it. Traffic has now been restored. Therefore, in the past two days, the number of rice boats arriving in the city from the north has slightly increased, totaling more than one hundred, and the price of rice has fallen by several cents as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Urgent Appeal from Henan Province for Disaster Relief <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xiwenzhou, the representative of the Henan Provincial Relief Association stationed in Shanghai, received an urgent telegram from the association yesterday. The telegram reads as follows: "To the Relief Associations of Various Provinces: We have recently sent a telegram to the Central Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Relief Commission, which reads: 'To the Executive Committee of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the Chairman of the National Government Chiang, the Heads of the various Yuan, the Ministers of the various Ministries, and the Chairman of the Relief Commission Xu Jun: The disaster in Henan is severe, deaths are continuing, and disaster relief funds are urgently needed. Our association has repeatedly appealed in telegrams, but the Ministry of Finance says that there are no more treasury bills left and cannot continue to allocate funds, and the disaster relief bonds have no source of funds and cannot be issued. The bad news has been received, and millions of disaster victims are crying in unison. The reason why the revolutionary government calls on the people and the people support the revolutionary government is that the government relieves the suffering of the people. The most painful thing for the people is starvation. Looking around Henan, there have been years of drought and floods, which have affected the entire province. Repeated wars have devastated more than fifty counties. During the spring famine, the poor and the rich are all in despair, dying in their hometowns and collapsing on the roads, numbering in the hundreds every day. More than tens of thousands of disaster victims have gathered in Xia, Luo, Zheng, and Bian, but there is no food for accommodation and no money for resettlement. We are deeply afraid that desperation will lead to unrest and that the situation will become unmanageable. Our association lacks the resources to provide relief and is deeply worried. The provincial treasury is empty and cannot raise funds. Treasury bills and bonds are not being issued. Our good compatriots are left to die and perish without any assistance. We hope that our government will not do this. We earnestly request you to allocate more funds and clearly indicate a solution. Millions of disaster victims are enduring death in the hope. Our hearts are in pain, and our words are direct. Please take note.' We ask for a unified call to allocate more funds for disaster relief. We are deeply grateful. Zhang Fang of the Henan Provincial Relief Association bows."</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the National Games. The competitions and publicity of the previous three days had attracted the attention of society as a whole.  Therefore, despite the cloudy weather, there weren't many spectators in the morning, as everyone knew that the important finals were in the afternoon. After noon, there was heavy traffic in front of the venue, which soon became crowded, and all the seats were filled.  Many men and women came from afar to Hangzhou to watch the games. The scene was no less grand than the opening day. The situation of yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Visiting Groups</p>
<p>Yesterday, in addition to those who purchased tickets to enter the venue, there were the following groups who came to visit: Anhui Girls' Middle School (30 people), Henan Women's Vocational School (5 people), Central University (15 people), Pudong Middle School (100 people), Taicang Middle School (50 people), Wuxi Middle School (15 people), Liaoning Tonghua Education Group (5 people), Xuzhou Middle School (400 people), Central Military Training Brigade (850 people), Shanghai East Asia Physical Education College (100 people), Liangjiang Physical Education College (100 people), Suzhou Chenglie Physical Education College (15 people), Chengdu University (19 people), Jimei Women's Vocational School (14 people), Kindergarten Normal School (27 people), and 42 schools and organizations from various cities and counties in this province, totaling approximately 29,800 people.</p>
<p>▲Number of Tickets Sold</p>
<p>The number of tickets sold at the entrances and exits of each venue on the third day was 1,068 for the track and field stadium, with a ticket price of 1,763 jiao; 770 for the basketball court, with a ticket price of 1,546 jiao; 11 for the tennis court, with a ticket price of 22 jiao; and 52 for the general admission tickets, with a ticket price of 104 yuan, totaling 1,901 tickets and a total ticket price of 381 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Traffic and Publicity</p>
<p>Since the entrances and exits of each venue were reorganized, the order has been further improved. The military police have maintained order throughout. The organizing committee also printed and distributed a map of the entrances and exits of the venue for the convenience of spectators. All the routes to each venue are marked on the map, allowing people to easily find their way around without having to wander back and forth, which was greatly appreciated. The various news items published in the official program were also praised by the audience. They were distributed in the venue early in the morning, so that people could get a comprehensive overview of the day's competition results.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Chen's Visit</p>
<p>For this National Games, each provincial and municipal government sent important officials as representatives to participate in Hangzhou. The Jiangsu Provincial Government originally appointed Chen Hexian, the Director of Education, as its representative, but the opening day coincided with the inauguration of the Jiangsu Provincial Government Committee members, so Chen was unable to come to Hangzhou. He visited the Games on the fourth day and expressed great satisfaction with the various arrangements. Chen also plans to stay longer to see the entire Games.</p>
<p>▲Dedicated Staff</p>
<p>Although the organizing committee staff have been working day and night for days, they are full of energy and show no signs of fatigue. The president and vice president, Dai Jitao and Zhang Renjie, as well as the director and deputy director of the preparatory committee, Zhu Jiahua and Zhou Xiangxian, are all very enthusiastic. In addition to handling all kinds of affairs, they also visit each venue. The organizing committee staff also arrive on time to work, so that the internal and external affairs are handled in a well-organized and orderly manner.</p>

<p>The Fudan University Student Army of Shanghai was established before the May 30th Massacre. It has held two major reviews and once came to Hangzhou to conduct field exercises. The army is well-organized, spirited, and renowned for its achievements. It is now reported that the army, consisting of more than 200 soldiers, led by instructors Dong Yuanqing and Zhou Jiada, will come to Hangzhou to perform strategic exercises to add to the excitement.

<p>Chen Xuzhou of Shanghai Fails in the 10,000 Meters</p>
<p>Cao Yu of Shanghai Fourth in Pole Vault</p>
<p>It turns out that the main key to Liaoning's victory in the track and field championship was the 10,000-meter final, where Chen Xuzhou of Shanghai unexpectedly failed. Secondly, Cao Yu only finished fourth in the pole vault, which had a significant impact on the score. However, the Shanghai team has an average talent level, and still has hope of winning a medal in the all-around competition. They should compete with the Northeast athletes again. Good luck to the Shanghai team.</p>

<p>(1) Nanjing Wins Big Over Hunan Nine to Two</p>
<p>(2) Liaoning Wins Over Tianjin Three to One</p>
<p>▲The Nanjing-Hunan Game</p>
<p>The first match of the second round was between Nanjing and Hunan. Not long after the start of the game, the Nanjing team launched a fierce attack on the opponent, and the Hunan inner defender slipped, but fortunately the goalkeeper saved the goal. Hunan was extremely lucky to not lose this ball.  For about ten minutes, the two sides were in a stalemate. Later, Jiang Zhihong, the right winger of Nanjing, made many excellent crosses, but unfortunately the center forward's shots were inaccurate and all failed.  Once, Liu Zukan, the left winger, took a corner kick, and the ball landed in a good spot. The center forward rushed up to head the ball, but it went over the crossbar, which was a great pity. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Hunan team tried to counterattack, but the Nanjing team's inner defenders were very strong, and the Hunan forwards could not cross the line. Thirty minutes later, Liu Zukan, the left winger of Nanjing, dribbled the ball along the sideline and went straight in. At the appropriate position, the pass went over the head of the Hunan defender, and the Nanjing right inner forward calmly shot the ball in.  After that, the Nanjing team successively shot two goals into the enemy's goal, but both were disallowed because of offside. At that time, the Hunan team was still recovering from the shock when the inner defender Deng Shuchu slipped another goal in. Then, the Nanjing right inner forward dribbled the ball straight in and scored another goal. After scoring the third goal, the Nanjing team's momentum increased even more. Finally, the right inner forward and the left winger successively dribbled in two more goals. The first half ended with a score of five to zero. Switching sides and fighting again, the Nanjing team had a strong momentum in the first ten minutes. With the help of Ling Yuanyang, the left winger Liu Zukan scored a goal. The Hunan team bucked up and also scored a goal. Soon after, the Nanjing right inner forward, with the assistance of the right winger, kicked in a goal. At twenty minutes, a certain Nanjing inner defender fouled in the twelve-yard area, and the Hunan center forward Fang kicked the ball into the net. In the last five minutes, the Nanjing team's Zhong Guanming and Ling Yuanyang scored two more goals. The final result was nine to two, and Nanjing won.</p>
<p>The reason for the Hunan team's defeat was that the whole team could not cooperate, and they were extremely flustered when receiving the ball, sometimes crowding together in one place, and sometimes retreating. As a result, the Nanjing team was able to attack continuously. However, the Nanjing team's shooting accuracy was lacking, otherwise the opponent's loss would have been even greater. The referee was Tang Zhongguang. The lineups of the two teams are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Nanjing Team: Tan Zhongzhang, Yu Mianchu, Gu Shuxun, Ling Huiyang, Gao Limin, Gu Yuanliang, Zhong Guanming, Ling Yuanyang, Liu Zukan, Jiang Zhihong</p>
<p>Positions: Goalkeeper, Right Back, Left Back, Center Back, Right Midfielder, Left Midfielder, Center Forward, Left Inner Forward, Right Inner Forward, Left Winger, Right Winger</p>
<p>Hunan Team: Li Guoji, Zou Shuzeng, Xie Jixian, Sun Ming, Xiang Shaoyi, You Shaoze, Chen Jiaying, Zhu Baofeng, Liu Xingheng, Wang Zidai, Zhou Shu'an</p>
<p>▲The Fierce Battle Between Liaoning and Tianjin</p>
<p>The football match between Liaoning and Tianjin was a battle between two strong teams. The outcome of this match was very important for the finals, so the two sides fought extremely fiercely. The Liaoning forwards were all strong and brave, and the team's coordination was good. In particular, the two inner defenders and the center back were commendable for their interception. Their passing can also be said to have reached a high level. On the Tianjin side, they had more courage than wisdom, which was a major reason for their failure. In terms of the team's overall skills, their defense was better than their offense. Sun Guilin, the left midfielder, was a rare talent for his interception and counterattack, making it difficult for the Liaoning team's forwards to move. In the previous match between the Tianjin team and the Zhejiang team, Sun played very well as the left inner forward, but today he played as the left midfielder, which greatly affected the forwards. After a bitter battle in the first half, each side scored one goal. In the second half, the Tianjin team's formation faltered, and Wu Gongrong, the left forward of Liaoning, scored a goal. Soon after, Liu Bao, the left winger, scored another goal. As a result, Liaoning won by a score of three to one.</p>

<p>▲The Situation of Kobe's Victory Over Hubei</p>
<p>The Kobe team sent back to the country</p>
<p>The Kobe Overseas Chinese basketball team, in view of the fact that overseas Chinese elsewhere have sent teams back to the country to serve, such as the baseball team from Honolulu and the basketball team from the Philippines, etc., while Japan alone had none, felt very regrettable. This time, the unprecedented National Games were held in Hangzhou, with participants from 22 provinces and cities. The number of athletes was the largest ever, bringing together the best athletes from across the country to compete and learn from each other. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Overseas Chinese did not hesitate to spend a lot of money to send the Kobe Overseas Chinese basketball team back to the country to participate in the grand event and promote it.

<p>The Kobe Overseas Chinese basketball team is called "V-Fly" and is one of the strongest teams in Kobe. It has won the Kobe basketball league championship for several years in a row and has never encountered an opponent. Westerners also participate in the Kobe basketball championship, and strong teams such as K.R.&amp;A.C. and the Canadian Academy are often defeated by them. The All-Japan Basketball Championship is divided into the Kansai and Kanto regions. The Kanto region has more universities, so it is stronger than the Kansai region. Kobe belongs to the Kansai region, and the Overseas Chinese basketball team also participates in the competition. This championship is held once a year. Last year, the team played against the Kansai Gakuin in the final for the championship. Because of unfair officiating, they lost by only one point and finished as the runner-up. This year, they played two friendly matches against the Kansai Gakuin again and won both times. The score of the second match was seventy-one to forty-four, a very large difference. On the night before returning to China, the Osaka Basketball Club sent a letter requesting a match. The team won again with a score of fifty-six to twenty. Their strength is strong and they dominate Japan. They can be ranked third in all of Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Hubei Team is the Essence of Central China <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Hubei basketball is the essence of Central China. In the Central China Games, the athletes from Wuhan won every match, and their skills were the best in all provinces. This time, they came from afar with the intention of competing against the teams from the North and South. One is the king of overseas, and the other is the hegemon of Central China, so there should be a fierce competition.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Yesterday's Game Was Very Worth Watching <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the referee slowly arrived at the venue. The whistle sounded and the battle began. The Kobe team wore bright red vests with yellow V's, and the Hubei team wore black vests with white letters, looking exceptionally valiant. Kobe took the lead, with Xu Chenghao passing the ball to the right forward Lei Huiwang, and the "Little Thunder" scored with a quick shot, opening the score. Xu Shengtong then scored two more goals in a row. Suffering this heavy blow, Hubei tried hard to recover, and Peng Shuchu and Yuan Qingwu also scored successively. Before long, the Kobe forwards displayed their prowess. Xu Shengtong's shots were almost always successful. Hubei made some gains, but the difference was already too great to catch up. The result of the first half was forty-eight to nineteen, and Kobe won.</p>

<p>After a ten-minute break and switching sides, Hubei showed slight improvement. Fortunately, Kobe's inside guards Xu Chengliang and Rong Qiaqia were compatible, and they coordinated with each other. Rong Shengzhen scored three points, and Chengliang infiltrated the enemy camp, scoring four consecutive points through clever maneuvers. Center Xu Chenghao also displayed great power, repeatedly making outstanding contributions. The team's passing was even more agile and fast, truly living up to the name "Flying." Although Hubei tried hard to recover, time was limited. With the sound of the Hu Jia, Kobe won with a score of 91 to 46. Referee: Qian Yiqin; Inspector: Dong Shouyi.</p>

<p>▲Hong Kong Achieves a Great Victory Over Nanjing</p>
<p>The Hong Kong vs. Nanjing game took place at 2:00 PM yesterday. Referee: Shu Hong; Inspector: Xu Zhendong. Hong Kong's strength lies in its unified action, speed, and agility. During the intense battle, both sides had cheerleading squads cheering them on, creating a magnificent and enthusiastic atmosphere. Nanjing was good at both offense and defense, but their shots were often too forceful, preventing them from achieving their desired results, which was a flaw. Hong Kong's method of avoiding the enemy was particularly ingenious, but they should avoid making playful gestures towards the opponent to prevent misunderstandings. They should pay attention to this in the future. Yu Xunzi, Chen Wei of Nanjing, and Huang Jiliang and Ye Yinsen of Hong Kong all had many commendable points. With diligent practice, achieving excellence will not be difficult. The result of the first half was 31 to 12, with Hong Kong leading significantly. In the second half, Nanjing tried desperately to catch up, which was quite effective. Hong Kong then used a delaying tactic, retreating and defending firmly. As a result, Nanjing lost with a score of 43 to 20.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, Nanjing and Jiangxi started their match. This was one of the preliminary rounds of the women's basketball tournament. The Nanjing cheerleaders shouted vigorously because their men's basketball team had already failed, and they wanted to vent their frustration in this match. Referee Shao Ji and Zhang Huilan blew their whistles, and the two teams engaged in fierce combat. Chen Yunlan of the Nanjing team made three consecutive shots, gaining the upper hand. Zhang Xingcong of Jiangxi also scored two points, but many of the Jiangxi players were not familiar with the rules, repeatedly receiving penalties, giving Nanjing many opportunities. Fang Xichen can be called an old general, making nine out of ten shots. Nanjing's victory was entirely dependent on Fang and Chen. The result was a score of 47 to 8.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Second Round: Fujian Wins Against Tianjin <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>▲A Score of 2 to 0</p>
<p>▲Fujian's Strength is Great</p>
<p>The Fujian volleyball team has long enjoyed a great reputation in South China, with a continuous stream of talented players. The team participating in this competition is composed of the elite players from the province, possessing formidable strength. The Tianjin team has long been renowned in North China and can be considered a strong force. They showed their skills in the preliminary rounds, and the audience praised them endlessly. At 9:00 AM on the 4th, the two teams met in the second round, and those in the know already anticipated a fierce competition. At the sound of the clock striking nine and the referee's whistle, the athletes of both teams braced themselves, attacking and defending, each showing their strengths. At the start of the match, Fujian was extremely strong. Cheng Qiaosheng, Weng Zulie, Liao Dengru, and Zhang Qiushen served the ball, scoring eleven consecutive points. The Tianjin team tried hard to resist but made no progress, which was unexpected by the audience. However, during the intense battle, there were many exciting performances. The reason for Tianjin's defeat was indeed poor coordination. Under such a strong enemy, trying to succeed by luck was naturally difficult. It was not a failure of strategy but a lack of strength. After changing sides, the Tianjin team showed some activity, scoring five points successively. However, Fujian's momentum was strong and unstoppable. In the end, they lost with a score of 5 to 21. In the second game, Tianjin's formation was excellent, with strong blocking in the front row and effective defense in the back row. The scores were consistently close, giving hope for a comeback. Unfortunately, at 13 to 14, they were repeatedly attacked by Fujian and limited by the surrounding circumstances. The Fujian team's offense and defense were effective, repeatedly achieving success, and the score gradually increased. They won the second game with a score of 21 to 13, resulting in a final score of 2 to 0. Referee: Tan Tianpei; The lineups of the two teams are listed on the left:</p>

<p>▲The Battle Between Guangdong and Shanghai</p>
<p>The second round of the volleyball championship between Guangdong and Shanghai B took place at 1:00 PM on the 4th. The Guangdong team has profound volleyball skills and a resounding reputation in South China. In this women's volleyball competition, they have a solid hope of winning the championship. The Shanghai B team is also a rising star, having defeated the strong Jiangsu team in the preliminary rounds, which was highly praised. Therefore, more than 1,000 people, attracted by the reputation of the two teams, went to watch the match, crowding both sides of the stands and creating an extremely lively atmosphere. At the start of the match, the two teams were evenly matched for the first few plays. The Guangdong team became increasingly brave as they fought, and the players were extremely agile, jumping and returning the ball with great skill. Shanghai B tried their best to resist but gradually felt overwhelmed. Their serves were powerful and their spikes were swift, surpassing even those of men. Compared to the strength of Shanghai B, the difference was too great. In less than ten minutes, they lost the first game with a score of 21 to 2. After continuing the battle, they continued to lose. From beginning to end, Shanghai B made no progress and eventually lost again with a score of 21 to 4. Judging from the situation of the match, the Guangdong team indeed had amazing skills.

The Beiping team was lively, well-coordinated, and skilled in serving and returning the ball. Their offense was also quite good. Liaoning's formation was scattered, and they were often negligent in their response, making them no match for Beiping. In the first game, the score was 21 to 8, and in the second game, it was 21 to 3. Beiping won two games in a row. Referee: Wu Bangwei; The names of the team members are listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e192">A Brief Review of Yesterday's Athletics Competition <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the final day of the men's and women's athletics competitions. The competition between Shanghai and Liaoning for the athletics championship was extremely intense. The audience was also more crowded and excited than the previous two days. Here is a brief description of the various finals:</p>
<p>▲200 Meters</p>
<p>The men's 200-meter final was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. The intense competition between the sprinters from the North and South was no less than that of yesterday's 100 meters. At the start of the race, Liu Changchun reversed his attitude from the previous few days, starting very quickly. He was in first place from start to finish. When he reached the finish line, he was about ten steps ahead of Zhong Lianji. The result was also quite good, proving that Liu had put in a lot of effort. Zhou Zhaoyuan of Tianjin was almost as fast as Liu in the first 100 meters. Zhong of Shanghai fell to third place, about one meter behind. By the finish line, Zhong had only surpassed Zhou by a shoulder, which was close.</p>
<p>▲800 Meters</p>
<p>In yesterday's 800-meter final, Deng Zhiming of Shanghai made a special effort and achieved a result of 2 minutes and 9 seconds, matching the national record set by Wang Xuanji, which was not easy. He was in the lead from start to finish. Lang Daikui of Liaoning was in fifth place at the start. Although he fought hard later, he finished second in the last half lap. When he was about 30 meters from the finish line, Lang desperately tried to catch up, but Deng Zhiming was already far ahead by ten steps, and there was no way to catch him.</p>
<p>▲Low Hurdles</p>
<p>In yesterday's men's low hurdles final, Cheng Jingguan of Jiangsu was in the lead at the start. Wang Yuzhen of Beiping and Liang Jingping of Guangdong followed closely. At around 120 meters, Liang of Guangdong started to run fast, leaping over the hurdles like flying, far surpassing Wang Yuzhen and Cheng Jingguan. Cheng had already fallen to second place. The result was 25.4 seconds, breaking the national record of 26.8 seconds set by Huang Jin in the 1929 North China Games, which was an outstanding result for the competition.</p>
<p>▲Women's 50 Meters</p>
<p>In the women's 50-meter final yesterday afternoon, Sun Guiyun, a female hero, immediately stood out and steadily won the championship. Liu Youqing and Huang Shuwei of Guangdong were also quite strong. If they work harder, they have a promising future. The result was 7.25 seconds, breaking the national record of 7.9 seconds held by Li Suiyin.</p>
<p>▲Women's 100 Meters</p>
<p>In yesterday's women's 100-meter final, Sun Guiyun was still in first place, and Liu Youqing was in second place. The distance between them was quite large, and there was no competition to speak of. The result was 13.8 seconds, breaking the record of 14.5 seconds set by Tong Jingbo in the 1929 North China Games.</p>
<p>▲10,000 Meters</p>
<p>Zhao Dexin Gallops Ahead</p>
<p>Setting a New National Record</p>
<p>Result: 35 Minutes, 36 Seconds and 1/5</p>
<p>Sixteen people participated in the 10,000-meter final. There were many good athletes, which attracted a lot of attention. Zhao Dexin of Liaoning, a famous long-distance runner from the Northeast, started leading after the first 1,000 meters, running ahead with steady steps from beginning to end. In the last 100 meters, he relied on his natural energy to surge forward, greatly increasing his speed, setting a new record of 35 minutes, 36 seconds and 1/5, which was commendable. Chen Xuzhou of Shanghai was also a good athlete, and he did his best yesterday, but due to his physique, he could not compete with the athletes from other places.</p>

<p>▲Pole Vault</p>
<p>The pole vault final was quite competitive. Fu Baolu of Dongte won first place with 3.28 meters, a good result. Fu is a handsome young man, and he did not reach his best result yesterday. Li Lin of Shanghai failed to qualify at 3.17 meters, which was a pity. Otherwise, Shanghai would have had a chance to win the athletics championship.</p>
<p>▲Javelin Throw</p>
<p>In the javelin throw final, the result was 44 meters. Pan Nanshun won first place, which was very close to the national record. Yang Chuntai of Tianjin was initially in first place with 42.98 meters, but Pan surpassed him with 44.52 meters on his first attempt.</p>
<p>▲Women's Long Jump</p>
<p>In the women's long jump final, Wu Meixian of Dongte won first place with 4 meters. Xie Kuidi and Liu Youqing of Guangdong tied for second place with 3.96 meters. Wang Zhizhong of Tianjin won fourth place. Sun Guiyun of Dongte failed to qualify because she had competed in the 50-meter and 100-meter races consecutively.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Worthy of the True Colors of Athletes <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Liu Changchun and Sun Guiyun</p>
<p>Liu Changchun, a male athlete from Liaoning, and Sun Guiyun, a female athlete from Dongte, have been the focus of attention since the opening of the competition. Liu won first place again in the 200-meter final yesterday (4th) at 1:00 PM, and Ms. Sun's result in the 50-meter final also exceeded her peers. As a result, the admiration for Liu and Sun has increased even more. Liu is usually straightforward, kind, and approachable. Although the athletes participating in this National Games compete against each other in sports, their feelings are still very harmonious because of Liu's attitude. Ms. Sun not only convinces people with her results but also inspires unity and the pursuit of progress with her gentle and courageous attitude. After yesterday's 50-meter final, she sat in the center of the field with Ms. Huang Shuwei of Guangdong and Ms. Cheng Enci of Nanjing to discuss sports for 20 minutes. When it came to important issues, such as the starting posture, she spoke in a dignified and loud voice. During the conversation, she would hold people's hands with her own and lean her head on their arms. Her attitude was truly remarkable. The French physical educationist Daos said in a speech at the National Stadium, "Athletes who have results but no attitude need to work harder." If Daos were at the scene, I believe he would have cheered and praised them as well.</p>

<p>▲ Exorbitant Prices</p>
<p>There are nine consumer cooperatives in the stadium and dormitory areas, exclusively selling cigarettes, snacks, fruits, and other items. However, the prices are very high. "Sky Bridge" brand cigarettes cost 200 cash per pack, lollipops cost 80 cash each, and fruits and snacks are all marked up by more than 40% compared to usual.大会的職員並不顧問、似乎外來朋友、自應敲上幾個小竹槓也、</p>
<p>▲ Regional Accents</p>
<p>Whenever there is a victory, two thousand athletes gather in the dining hall, feasting heartily and loudly discussing the day's competitions. The Wu dialect and other regional accents vary greatly – some are harsh, some are soft, some are soft yet harsh, and some are harsh with a touch of softness. Coupled with the clatter of bowls and chopsticks, it's like a grand gathering of dialects.</p>
<p>▲ Making a Statement</p>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, the weather was bad, with light rain and unusual cold. The athletes still braved the wind and rain to compete as usual. Male athletes' overcoats and female athletes' large shawls filled the stadium. The Guangdong female athletes' beige leather-collared outerwear was particularly distinctive.</p>
<p>▲ One in Every Hand</p>
<p>Canes made of domestic rattan are a must-have for anyone visiting Hangzhou for strolling. The athletes, finding them cheap and beautiful, bought them en masse and played with them in their hands, appearing quite pleased with themselves.</p>
<p>▲ Skin Injuries</p>
<p>In recent days, many female athletes have been injured from falls during races or have contracted minor illnesses. A survey is as follows: (1) Luo Qiyun of the Zhejiang team (skin abrasion on the knee), (2) Feng Shuzhen of the Jiangxi team (gastritis), (3) Ni Yunmei of the Zhejiang team (skin abrasion on the finger), (4) Liu Jingzhen of Harbin (injuries to upper and lower limbs), (5) Luo Huilin of the Hunan team (sore throat), (6) Zhang Guoqi of the Nanjing team (sunburn on the face), (7) Zhan Zongzeng of the Tianjin team (skin abrasion on the arm), (8) Xu Bang'ai of the Tianjin team (skin abrasion on the arm).</p>
<p>▲ Black and White Distinction</p>
<p>The Guangdong athletes' sportswear consists of white undershirts adorned with red characters indicating "Guangdong." The female athletes are the same, while the lower half consists of long trousers for men and black shorts for women, tightly wrapping around the middle of the thighs. When moving, their inner thighs make fragmented movements.</p>
<p>▲ A Women's Army Parading Through the City</p>
<p>The entire contingent of talents from the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School has come to Hangzhou to show their mettle. Every day, they proceed in formation from the Lakeside Road area to the stadium, with the military band in the front, the student soldiers in the middle, armed with wooden rifles, and the boy scouts at the rear. Four abreast, about a hundred people in total. The music of the military band is extremely soft, graceful, and nuanced, complemented by the sound of drums, creating a blend of imposingness and gentleness. Each time they pass, the city dwellers stand to watch, and the street urchins call out, "The women's army is here!"</p>
<p>▲ All Hope for Li Huitang</p>
<p>Li Huitang's superb skills are renowned far and wide. Not only do the people of Zhejiang eagerly want to see him, but athletes from all directions also want to take this opportunity to witness Li's great skills. Unfortunately, good things don't last. Li suddenly returned to Shanghai due to illness, which will undoubtedly affect the strength of the Shanghai team. A group of enthusiasts expressed their disappointment.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Xueliang Introduces Feng Yong</p>
<p>Feng Yong, the principal of Liaoning Feng Yong University, has made outstanding achievements in educational endeavors in the border regions. Since the outbreak of the Middle Eastern Railway issue, which triggered Sino-Russian negotiations, Feng led his student army to Manchuria to resist. He has now come south with his team to experience the flavors of southern China. Zhang Xueliang, in order to comfort a worthy person, sent a telegram to the Games to introduce Feng. It is said that Feng strongly advocates sports and has a particular fondness for basketball and football. Therefore, in recent days, Feng has been a frequent sight in the Games' basketball and football fields.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Anecdotes from the Opening Ceremony of the National Games <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yingchuan Furun, from Hangzhou</p>
<p>The magnificent and enthusiastic National Games had its opening ceremony at West Lake the day before yesterday. More than 20,000 people attended. Having returned from participating in the grand ceremony, the reporter has gathered some anecdotes from the event to share with Juanweng.</p>
<p>The venue was the old military camp, located southeast of Meidong Gaoqiao. The architecture is magnificent, divided into track and field, football, baseball, tennis, and basketball courts, covering an area of about 400 acres. The command platform is located to the west of the field. Several dozen silver cups and shields are displayed in the middle, wondering which athletes will win them. On the platform are Chairman Chiang, his wife Madame Soong Mei-ling, prominent figures of the party and the state such as Dai Jitao, Wang Zhengting, Soong Ziwen, Chu Minyi, Shao Lizi, Chen Guofu, and the Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Zhang Jingjiang, creating a lively scene. Wu Zhihui also attended in plain clothes. His humorous tone during the speech made everyone laugh.</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang respectfully read Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, there was a three-minute moment of silence. Although there were as many as 20,000 people in the large venue, it was completely silent. Suddenly, there was a loud cannon sound in the center of the field. Everyone was startled, suspecting it was a bomb. For a moment, the order was disrupted. After inquiries, it was learned that it was the final sound of the twenty-one-gun salute. However, everyone had already experienced a false alarm.</p>
<p>Those who gave speeches included Shao Yuanchong of the Central Party Department and Wang Zhengting of the National Government. Finally, Chairman Chiang gave a speech. To attract the attention of the public, he stood on a trapezoidal platform and used radio waves to broadcast his voice. In addition to calling on the people to pay attention to physical education, Chiang criticized Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang of the Northwest for colluding with reactionary elements and endangering the central government. At key points, he gestured with his fist, with a sorrowful and indignant tone, making the entire audience stand in awe.</p>
<p>Fearing that there might be reactionary sabotage, the military and police guards were heavily guarded and prohibited the distribution of any leaflets to curb the source of the chaos. The intention was good. However, while the athletes were standing in a circle to take the oath, the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee suddenly distributed five-colored leaflets in the field, with red and green colors fluttering like butterflies, which was very beautiful.</p>
<p>The meeting ended at 11:00 AM. Chairman Chiang and his wife returned to Chiang's Villa in West Lake for dinner. Along the way, reporters scrambled to take pictures, with forty to fifty people surrounding him. Some jokingly said that the Commander-in-Chief was besieged.</p>
<h3 id="e204">A Strange Disease <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>In the western countryside of Huzhou, there is an old woman who is nearly sixty years old. Her hair is as black as lacquer and longer than her ankles, surpassing that of young women. One day, she was combing her hair when she was accidentally injured by the teeth of the comb, and blood flowed like a spring. She hurriedly applied medicine to stop it. In the past half month, there have been all kinds of changes, the strangest of which is that if someone touches one of her hairs, her entire body feels pain. When in pain, each strand curls up, and it takes more than an hour to subside.</p>
<p>According to a Western doctor, a woman in Paris once suffered from epilepsy. Whenever it broke out, her hair would stand on end, which was extremely terrifying. This shows that hair on the human body also has nerves and has a sense of feeling. Only those with abundant blood and Qi will not go bald even in old age. The old woman has always been plethoric. Medical treatment is ineffective, and it is feared that she will become insane.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Notes on the Continued Trial of the Gao Ying Case <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Former Vice Consul of San Francisco, Gao Ying, his wife, Ms. Liao, was found to have smuggled luggage for others, which contained opium. The Gao couple was suspected of trafficking opium and was extradited back to China. The Jiangning District Court sentenced them to imprisonment separately. The Gao couple refused to accept the verdict and appealed. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Higher Court held the second trial. I was shaken by the fame of the case, so I went to listen. So I recorded the anecdotes of the meeting, in order to feed my readers.</p>
<p>▲ A Bird's-Eye View of the Venue　The trial began at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the First Tribunal of the court. The court is a large, ancient-style hall in our country. It is extremely spacious. The portrait and will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen are hanging in the middle. There are couplets on the pillars on both sides. The text says: "Rectify the discipline, eliminate the violence and protect the good." The judges' seats are in the middle. Behind it are the seats for the officials to listen. The defendant's seat is in the front. The lawyers' seats are in the center of the court. The journalists' seats are on both sides. The audience seats are behind the lawyers' seats. The layout is very neat. Although there were three or four hundred listeners, they remained silent throughout. It was really solemn.</p>
<p>▲ Difficult to Obtain Audience Tickets　In view of the congestion at the first trial of the case, the court issued audience tickets this time, with strict restrictions. All those who requested tickets had to be introduced by agencies or groups with letters. The court's publicity office was dedicated to this matter. Therefore, hundreds of people were denied entry. The audience members were mostly representatives and staff from various agencies and academia. Women accounted for four out of ten of the total number, which also shows the general attention of women to the rule of law.</p>
<p>▲ Liao, the Blackened Gao's Wife　Ms. Gao wore a full body of black clothing, except for her jade-colored stockings. Her curly hair was fluffy, covering her cheeks, and she was wrapped in a Yuan-colored thin veil embroidered with black flowers. The veil hung down her back. She wore a black Indian silk cheongsam and black velvet high-heeled shoes. She was plump, but her face was sallow and her expression depressed. She was very different from her old self.</p>
<p>▲ Two Foreign Firm Runners　Gao Ying and Sun Yuan both wore small-legged Western-style pants and Chinese-style cotton robes that were only knee-length, much like foreign firm runners. However, Gao's blue foreign cloth robe and black straight tribute ne shoes were far less beautiful than Sun's silk robe and leather shoes. Sun Yuan's demeanor was still natural, while Gao was drooping his head, looking very painful. Onlookers, thinking that his talent could be used, could not help but feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>▲ Lawyer Liu Surrounded by People　Although the case was being heard for the second time, due to the complexity of the case, the facts were still being examined yesterday and there was no debate. The lawyer had no chance to speak throughout. After the court adjourned, reporters from various newspapers flocked to Gao Ying's defense lawyer, Liu Shifang, to inquire about his opinions and arguments on the case. Lawyer Liu politely declined, saying that it was not yet time to publish. He hurriedly returned to the lawyer's lounge. The reporters still surrounded him and asked questions without dispersing. Lawyer Liu then handed over the old San Francisco lawyer Wahl Lai who testified in court to prove that Consul General Gong disagreed with Gao Ying and other letters that could be used as evidence, and gave them to the reporters to copy.</p>
<p>▲ Eyeglasses Exhibition　Most of the viewers on this day wore eyeglasses. All kinds of Roque-style flat-edged mirrors, non-sleepy style, and old-fashioned copper-edged straight-leg styles were available. New and old were all available, and everything was beautiful. Some of the viewers raised their heads and listened quietly, and some jokingly said that they were opening an eyeglasses exhibition that could be compared with the Shanghai fashion exhibition.</p>
<h3 id="e206">A Record of Walking to Beijing (Part II) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Hanru, Member of the National Walking Group</p>
<p>On March 2nd, we went to Changshu. We encountered rain in Changshu for days, which made it impossible to move forward. We were treated to everything by the Changshu Branch of the China National Road Construction Association. The news industry in Changshu is extremely developed. There are as many as twelve newspaper offices in the whole city. For example, the Qinbao is larger, with a daily circulation of 1,500 copies. It is rare to see more than ten newspaper offices in a small county town. On the 8th, we were guided by Cheng Junjunyan, the general manager of the branch, to tour Yushan. We did not leave Changshu until the afternoon of the 10th to go to Wuxi. On the evening of the 10th, we stayed at the home of Bao Jun in Wangzhuang, on the border between Changshu and Wuxi. The next morning, we encountered rain after walking about ten li. We continued to move forward in the rain. The rain became heavier and heavier, and the raincoats lost their effectiveness. In addition, the road was muddy, and we slipped at every step. Comrade Xu fell four times in a row, which made us feel that we could not move forward. At 6:00 PM, we arrived in Wuxi. Our clothes were wet inside and out, like a drowned chicken. We stayed in Wuxi for several days, visiting various factories and touring Huishan and Meiyuan. On the 15th, we left Wuxi for Changzhou. We visited Qian Mingshan (Zhenhuang), a famous scholar in Jiangnan, in Changzhou. On the afternoon of the 16th, we left Changzhou for Danyang. That night, we stayed overnight in Xinzha Town in the county. The villagers were closing their doors. Because it was not yet dark, there was no reason to go to bed. Later, Liu, the platoon leader of the garrison, came and told us that some villagers had reported to him that six bandits had arrived in the town, so they all closed their doors. We told them about our mission. Liu explained to the villagers, and they all calmed down. Fortunately, Liu did not trade in his business, otherwise he would have led his troops to fire guns. We also suspected that the bandits were robbing, which would have been a terrible misunderstanding. We set off at 5:00 AM on the 17th and arrived in Danyang City at 6:00 PM. We stayed in Danyang for a day. On the evening of the 18th, we camped out at Zhaize Station, ten li away from Zhenjiang. We arrived in Zhenjiang at dawn on the 19th. It was the reorganization of the provincial government. The Zhenjiang column of a certain newspaper reported that our group had arrived in Zhenjiang by car, which was not accurate. On the 24th, we left Zhenjiang for Beijing. We stayed overnight at the Longtan Cement Factory. We arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 25th. We entered Taipingmen. President Zheng Shaojue of Jinan University specially opened the Jinan University Alumni Association as our residence. This is a brief record of our journey from Shanghai to Ningbo.</p>
<p>It took us thirty-three days to reach Beijing this time. On average, we walked more than sixty li a day. There are about 1,400 steps per kilometer. Some villagers said that we were measuring the railway, and some said that we were doing business. There were various rumors. In terms of accommodation, we either slept on copper beds, or lay on the grass, or ate mountain delicacies, or ate Rao cakes. The environment changed every day. Our bodies felt a little pain, but our spirits increased greatly. There was endless fun. We obtained documents from the official office for reference and confirmed them to the people along the way. We plan to stay in Beijing for ten days and then cross the canal to the north. We hope that the advanced people in Shanghai will give us more instructions to correct our deficiencies.</p>
<h3 id="e207">A Record of Guan Gong Crab <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Sang Junfu</p>
<p>My hometown, Shangyu, has beautiful mountains and rivers and natural scenery. It is located in the Qiantang River tributary, and the most beautiful place is Xihua Village, about forty li away from the West Gate. There is a swamp called Shuanglian Lotus Pond, which is also a scenic spot. According to legend, the pond was formed by a tidal surge during the Song Dynasty. When Liang Shanbo was the county magistrate of Shangyu, he often led his subordinates to fish there during the summer. The pond is not very deep, but the area is very wide, and the silt is very thick. Lotuses are planted all over the pond. Every Midsummer, when the lotus blossoms are in full bloom, the fragrance of lotuses can be smelled for ten li. Recently, a kind of crustacean has suddenly appeared in the pond. It is similar to a crab but slightly smaller. The color of the back shell is slightly red, similar to the color of shrimp shells after being cooked, and the patterns are shaped like ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, forming a spectacle. The villagers who saw it were amazed. According to old fishermen in central Zhejiang, this kind of crustacean is called Guan Gong Crab. In the past, a small number of them were found in Jinhua, Quzhou, Yan, and other places in southern Zhejiang, but now they have disappeared. It is said that the emergence of this crab is due to the blood of Guan Gong flowing into the water after he was killed. I think this statement is similar to the Qi Dong Ye Yu and is not enough to be a sign. However, the emergence of this crustacean is really strange. Therefore, I recorded it for the research of naturalists.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10 Filial Piety from the Curtain. Meeting the Famous Players</p>
<p>At this time. Inside the Tsingliu Society, there was one most cheerful person. This person's surname was Lu, and his name was Lu Junfu. He was from Changzhou, and he had studied in Japan for many years. He also married a Japanese woman. Originally, China and Japan were of the same race and culture after all, so many Japanese women liked to marry Chinese men. In terms of physique, Chinese men were tall and upright, unlike the short and stout Japanese. Especially like Lu Junfu, standing in the middle of Japanese men, he looked even more like a crane standing among chickens. He was originally a tall man. There was another reason why Japanese women were willing to marry Chinese. It was that Japanese women were very bitter. They took serving men as their heavenly duty. In reality, Japanese men and women were the most unequal. In middle-class families, they could not hire servants, so they had to do everything themselves. Even barefoot, scrubbing the floor and so on, they had to do it themselves. In China, even middle-class families hired an old nanny or a young maid. Women could call themselves Madame at any time. After eating their fill, they could do nothing, or play mahjong to pass the time. Therefore, after a few women who had married Chinese said so, when they saw how carefree it was, they could not help but envy them. Therefore, at that time, many Japanese women were willing to marry Chinese students. Lu Junfu was also a member of the Tsingliu Society. He played a young man in the new drama. He was the most suave and refined. Before the premiere, he was the most active. The script they chose was called "Hototogisu". This "Hototogisu" was originally a famous Japanese novel. It was written by a Japanese novelist, Tokutomi Roka. This novel caused quite a stir when it came out. Almost everyone had one copy. Even Europeans translated it into Western languages. In Japan, it was adapted into a script and performed several times in theaters. When they were studying in Japan, they naturally went to see it. Later, their Tsingliu Society also performed it once or twice. When the Japanese performed it, they used Japanese. When the Chinese performed it, of course, they used Chinese. Fortunately, their dramas had scripts that were made public. As long as you bought their scripts and studied them, and Japanese performers were also scholars, unlike the so-called Chinese actors, some of whom did not even know the characters, but were a bunch of rude people. Therefore, when they performed that "Hototogisu" in Japan, they asked them to guide them, and they were all happy to do so. This "Hototogisu" was a family tragedy. It described a woman who married a husband. They were very affectionate. Unexpectedly, her mother-in-law was very fierce. Because the daughter-in-law had lung disease, she drove her out when her son went to the military. The woman's lung disease was very deep. After this blow, she died in her mother's home. Her mother was a stepmother. Later, until she died, she did not see her husband. When the husband received the news of her death, he himself was injured in a field hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Financial - Gold Price High Then Low <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>▲ Raw Silver Tax Re-proposed</p>
<p>▲ Two Taels Lower Than Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, the fourth day, the price of gold rose and then fell. Compared with the previous market, there was a difference of about three taels. The afternoon market was particularly sluggish, with only a slight difference of one tael. Sellers were eager to sell. From the early morning, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Changyuan, Maoyong, and others were inclined to sell. Hengxing, Jin'an, Xuchang, and others all bought in. The large silver bars continued to shrink, so the opening was high. Afterwards, it once penetrated outside 506 taels. Although the foreign exchange rate had been reduced by one level, the domestic market was struggling to maintain its position. Banks sold slightly, and the market atmosphere was poor, so it turned to a low point. By noon, it had broken below 504 taels. Later, Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, and others all bought in, while Yuanmaoyong, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Chang, and others sold a lot. It was rumored that the proposal to tax the import of raw silver was suddenly raised again, and people were terrified. It has now continued to fall by more than one tael, and the exchange rate has eased accordingly. The price of British silver bars has recently shrunk by sixteen thirty-seconds, and the forward price has shrunk by one-quarter. The price of silver has also fallen by one-quarter. The exchange rate remains the same.</p>
<p>▲ A High Price of Six Taels and One Mace Appeared in the Morning, Then Gradually Declined. The Opening Price of Gold for May Rose by One Tael and Two Mace, to 505 Taels and Seven Mace. The gross price fluctuated by seven or eight mace. From five taels and two or three mace, it increased to six taels and five mace. The demand from each firm varied, and the exchange rate also changed slightly. At the beginning of the month, the British gold price was offered by Mitsui at 11 pence and 125. Later, HSBC paid 10 pence and 9375. The forward price was traded between the Bank of Japan at 11 pence and 0625. The shilling quotation has been reduced by 25, the US dollar by 50 cents, and the Japanese gold by 1 cent and 25, but it did not move because it had already been raised. Moreover, the internal market was flat. The British gold price for June was once settled at 11 pence and 0625, which was 5 taels and 89 mace at that time. After a while, it was 5 taels and 3 mace. Then, because Mitsui bought a current shipment to Dalian at 1 tael and 06 fen, it reached 6 taels and 1 mace after 10 o'clock. Afterwards, it gradually declined, mainly because Yuanmaoyong, Yongfu, Chang, and others successively sold off, and the exchange rate became more relaxed. Mitsui offered 11 pence and 125 for July British gold, and later the Chinese Commercial Bank for May</p>
<p>offered 125, and 1875 was traded for June. People's sentiment fluctuated, and they unloaded two taels and several mace. By noon, it had broken through 4 taels. The closing price at noon was 3 taels and 6 mace.</p>
<p>▲ The Market Weakened After the News of the Silver Tax Arrived. The Opening Price in the Afternoon Market Was 503 Taels and 3 Mace. Afterwards, it increased by about two taels, which was bought by the Dalian gang. After 2:15, due to people's weakness and hearing that the raw silver tax was brought up again, the news came and dropped to 3 taels. However, Mitsui absorbed 1 tael and 05 fen and 375 of the current Dalian shipment. The Bank of Japan traded 11 pence and 1875 for June British gold, and 47 yuan and 0625 for the US dollar. Trading in and out was possible. Afterwards, it slightly increased by seven or eight mace, reaching 3 taels and seven or eight mace at 2:45. After 3 o'clock, sellers suddenly surged. June Japanese gold was purchased and settled at 1 tael and 05 fen, and British gold could be settled at 11 pence and 1875, and 125 for the near term, so the price was particularly weak. It fell by more than one tael. After 4 o'clock, it was only 2 taels and 3 mace. The closing price at 4:30 was 2 taels and a half, which was 2 taels lower than the third day.</p>
<p>▲ The Exchange Rate Against Japanese Yen is Still a Small 14 or 15 Taels. The Highest Price of the Day Was 6 Taels and a Half, and the Lowest Price Was 2 Taels and 3 Mace.

<p>▲ Varying Transactions by Different Firms. The Transactions Among Fellow Traders Included Buying by Chenfengyong, Xuchang, Jin'an, Xiangfeng, Taixing, Bingxing, Tianxiang, Yuanda, Fuxing, Yong, etc. Hengxing, Shunli, and Wanxing had mixed transactions, but generally sold more than they bought. Yuanmaoyong, Yuda, Xiangyu, Shengda, Yongkang, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Yuanmao, etc., all sold. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Yongfeng, Fuxingyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuda, etc., all purchased. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Yuankangxiang, Xuchang, etc., all sold out. The transactions of other firms were inconsistent.

Overseas telegrams indicated that Indian exchange rates were reduced by a small 875, to 53 rupees and 25. Telegrams from Yokohama and Kobe repeatedly stated not to change. As for the domestic market in this port, the internal market was initially firm but later weakened, and ultimately became more deficient, not to mention the situation of being clearly tight but secretly loose. This was actually the trend of the gold market going from sharp to declining. By the afternoon closing, compared with the previous day, the shilling was long by 0625, the US dollar was long by 125, and the Japanese gold was reduced by 125. Chinese merchants and speculators bought in slightly, with British gold amounting to more than 100,000 pounds.

They also settled 1 million yuan, and Industry and Commerce still had a strong desire to sell. The Dalian Gang sold tens of thousands of yuan of Dalian exchange bills to Mitsui, etc., in the near and far future, to invest in the gold market.

<p>This year, the financial community is particularly cautious about various loan businesses due to market conditions. Therefore, everyone is hesitant to contact and negotiate early for silk cocoon loans. General silk foreign firms and silk merchants have tried their best to raise money, but to no avail, resulting in a dull atmosphere in the silk cocoon market. It is vaguely heard that the money shops have not yet expressed their approval or disapproval of the trading of these 37 silk cocoon loans, so there has been no transaction. However, some Chinese commercial banks have already been in contact. According to investigations, Zhejiang silk merchants have agreed to about 300,000 to 400,000, with unspecified interest rates. Jiangsu silk merchants have agreed to 700,000 to 800,000, with interest rates of 9 taels and a half to 10 taels, with a term of two to three months, and repayment at any time. Other silk merchants and foreign firms with various stocks and actual assets still have old accounts to pad the loans, which are not examples of doing business. All the selling period foreign exchange rates have not been opened, only agreeing to use a certain amount of tens of thousands, and when it is time to use it, settling the price according to the foreign exchange rate on that day, so that both parties do not suffer losses. From now on, the transaction of period foreign exchange rates will be completely eliminated.</p>

<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, More Than 30 Ships Arrived at Each Stall, and the Market Sales Were Stagnant and Listless. The Buying of Northern Japonica Rice Was Even More Quiet, and the High Secondary Steps of the Large Plate Were Reduced. However, The Top Goods Were Still Flat, and the Current Market Trend Was Difficult to Boost. Although It Was Rainy and Continuous, the Store Sales Were Still Not Developing. Therefore, the Transactions of Thin Rice Were Even More Rare, and the Arrival Source Was Not Smooth. The Market Price Was Stabilized, and the Sales of Sheep Xian Were Not Weak. However, There Was a Shortage of Goods. The Sharp Point of Du Was Because Buyers Were Aware of the Cheap Price of Foreign Rice, and Their Minds Were Gradually Turning. Therefore, The Prices of Each Xian Rice Were Just Barely Holding on to the Original Plate. The Arrival and Sales of Transformed Yuan Yin Hua Were Both Dull and There Were No Ups and Downs.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai: There Were Not Many Ships Down the River, and the Sales Were Stagnant in the Morning and Flat in the Afternoon. The High-End Goods of Changxi Northern Japonica Rice Still Needed 20 Yuan, and the Secondary Goods Were Slightly Weak. The Ke Wei of Su Tong Bang Machine Japonica Rice Was Not Strong. However, The Goods Continued to Be Sold by the Goods, and the Large Plate Was Freshly Honorable. The Path of the Southern Bang Thin Early Rice Was Not Refreshing. Although the Authorities Strictly Forbade Hoarding and Watching, The Buyers Picked and Chose Very Strictly. Therefore, The Situation Gradually Turned Worse. There Were Not Many Sheep Du Tip Rivers Stored, and the Goods Arriving Were Also Dull. However, The Sales Were More Transformed Than the Previous Market, So the Market Plate Was Stable. However, at Present, There Were Frequent Short Telegrams from Foreign Markets, and There Was Concern That Foreign Rice Would Pinch the Feet and Could Not Stand Firm. The Two Stomachs of Bai Yuan Hanging Rice Were Also Moved, and Native and Guest Goods Arrived One After Another. The Market Price Was Not Rising or Falling.</p>
<p>The Authorities Strictly Limited, and the Goods Were Sold by the Goods, So It Swirled, Therefore, in the Weakness of the Afternoon, It Seemed That a Hard Stand Was Emerging.</p>

<p>— Light Flight</p>
<p>Spring is here again, "Spring does not feel like spring to the poor family." It seems that those who are spiritually poor (Poors in Spirit) still don't feel like they have been described.</p>
<p>The tender yellow willows, the delicate warbling birds, the lively elementary school students, the vigorous runners, and the couples walking side by side whispering - on Jiangwan Road, in the eyes of ordinary people, in the eyes of Guangmei, are naturally enviable. In my eyes, however, it only gives me a fragment of profound emotion and silence.</p>
<p>I didn't feel as uncomfortable as Guangmei about the "clothes hanger of a Western dress." Sometimes I feel annoyed by the lack of freedom (I say honestly), and sometimes I get some pleasure in my subconscious. Naturally, they have no place in my conscious mind. However, I, who have always been arrogant and self-confident, have recently felt that I am just a girl. How unreliable people's morals are! Sometimes I even assume that they are pitiful bugs, and I even think of Feng Xiaoqing's poem "I wish I could get a drop of Yangzhi water and sprinkle it on the earth as a pair of lotus flowers." I smiled and secretly told Bing, and she also smiled and said, "If I had two bodies, one to let her fall and taste the taste of falling, is it better to fall willfully or to be well-behaved?"</p>
<p>Zhen in the next room often recites, "As flies to wanton boys are we to Gods, they kill us with their sports" (Like flies in the hands of children, we are played to death in the hands of Gods and demons). "Is that so?" I often ask myself after reciting it like her. "Is that really so?" However, Zhen is famous as "Westernized Daiyu" because of this. It's just that "Mr. Baoyu" has never met. Once I teased her (under the moonlight on Jiangwan Road after dinner) and said, "If Mr. Baoyu finds her, our Daiyu may have to be even more Westernized and become Clara Bow." She smiled and said, "Clara Bow is the best. If only I could transform myself into her."</p>
<h3 id="e234">Research on Suicide <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ze</p>
<p>Suicide is not just an important research topic in psychiatry, but also a social problem that we cannot ignore, like crime, prostitution, poverty, unemployment, and marriage. Suicide is not a recent product of the civilized world; it has existed since ancient times. Before Christianity spread in Europe, suicide was morally accepted. In the Orient, especially in China and Japan, it was even more so. For example, loyal ministers to their rulers, and virtuous women to their husbands, often gained fame and were respected by the world for committing suicide. In Japan, before the Meiji Restoration, warriors who had committed wrong would disembowel themselves (the Japanese call it "Seppuku"), to apologize to their lords. However, this kind of suicide is a product of their special traditions and environment, and cannot be equated with the suicide we are discussing here. If you read Mr. Kuai An's "A Virtuous and Loyal Girl," you will understand that the so-called loyal ministers and virtuous women of ancient times who committed suicide to preserve their virtue were not only forced to do so by the social customs, systems, and morality of the time, but were also compelled by their elders to sacrifice themselves! Strictly speaking, this cannot be called "suicide," but rather "homicide."</p>
<p>Nowadays, suicide is increasing day by day. In civilized countries, this phenomenon is even more pronounced. Not only the number of suicides, but also the percentage of suicides per population, is increasing year by year, and this increase is very rapid, which is alarming. For example, in Germany, between 1836 and 1911, over a period of about 75 years, the national population increased by only 41%, while the number of suicides in Prussia increased from 1,446 to 8,179 (about 5.06 times), and in Saxony from 162 to 1,573 (about 9.7 times). Other countries have also experienced this phenomenon. For instance, between 1870 and 1900, a period of only 30 years, the number of suicides in Austria increased from 1,560 to 4,215 (about 2.7 times), in Italy from 836 to 2,040 (about 2.4 times), in France from 4,490 to 8,926 (about 2 times), in the United States from 1,495 to 2,896 (about 1.9 times), and in Switzerland from 321 to 746 (about 2.3 times). We are not sure if these statistics are reliable, but there is no doubt that suicide is becoming more common day by day. The number of suicides in Japan is even higher than in European and American countries. In 1916 (Year 5 of the Republic), there were 9,599 suicides, and by 1925 (Year 14 of the Republic), the number had increased to 12,249. Our country does not have precise statistics on the number of suicides, but according to the statistics of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government's Social Bureau, in July of the 18th year of the Republic, in Shanghai alone, there were as many as 265 suicide cases, of which 58 people died, 195 were rescued, and 3 were unclear. This is an increase of 28 cases compared to August of the 17th year of the Republic (237 cases). The number of suicides in Shanghai is increasing day by day, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>Why is it that the more developed the culture, the more suicides there are, and why do urban residents account for a larger proportion? On the one hand, the more advanced the society, the more complex the social organization and social life, and thus the more natural it is that desires cannot be fulfilled. On the other hand, material civilization gradually leads urban residents to become neurasthenic. The most common cause of suicide is the inability to fulfill some desire (such as unrequited love, world-weariness, etc.) or the loss of social status or property. Therefore, those with underdeveloped desires, and those who have no status or property to lose, such as the extremely poor, commit suicide less often. In addition to these external reasons, suicide is also caused by internal factors, such as mental excitement or abnormalities.</p>
<p>The age of suicide, regardless of gender, is most common between fifteen or sixteen and thirty years old, and men are more likely to commit suicide than women. According to Japanese statistics from 1928 (Year 17 of the Republic), the age of suicide among men is highest between 20 and 24 years old, with a total of 1,106 people, followed by 15 to 19 years old, with 596 people, and then 25 to 29 years old, with 702 people. Among women, the age of suicide is highest between 20 and 24 years old, with 792 people, followed by 15 to 19 years old, with 696 people. The reason why women commit suicide less often than men is because women have less direct responsibility for life and are less affected by the pain of bankruptcy and unemployment. The reasons for women's suicide are mostly related to sexual relations. Thus, regardless of gender, suicide is most common during adolescence. However, there are also many suicides among elderly people over sixty to eighty years old. They mostly commit suicide because of difficult living conditions, illness, loneliness, or family discord in their old age.</p>
<p>Another point that deserves our attention and interest is that in foreign countries, men commit suicide more often than women, but this is not the case in our country. Sometimes, women commit suicide much more often than men. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Bureau, in July of the 18th year of the Republic, among the 237 suicide cases in Shanghai, there were 116 men and 140 women, accounting for 54.69% of the total. Moreover, the number of suicides is highest in July and August. Regarding this, the Social Bureau attributes the reason to this: "If suicide is due to livelihood difficulties, then it should be most common during the coldest months of winter." However, in fact, it is not the case. Suicide is more common during the hot months of July and August, because suicide is often caused by quarrels. In July and August, people cannot endure the heat in their pigeonhole-like houses and go to the alleys to cool off, which naturally increases the opportunity to contact neighbors and increases the chance of neighborly quarrels, directly increasing the chance of suicide. Moreover, the depression of summer is enough to make women with weak will power unable to withstand the stimulation and turn to suicide. Among these 265 suicide cases, 147 were due to family problems, accounting for 57.43% of the total, which shows the drawbacks of our country's family system.</p>
<p>As for the method of suicide, it is also of great research value, because the method of suicide contains a kind of popularity. For example, in Japan, since 1902, after the high-achieving student Fujimura Misao of the First High School jumped into the Kegon Falls, there was a temporary surge in suicides by jumping into waterfalls, which became a kind of fashion. The authorities were caught off guard. Later, a poisonous drug called "Potassium bichromate" became popular. In 1917 and 1918 (Years 6 and 7 of the Republic), after a rat poison called "Nuko irazu" (No Need for Cats) was invented, eight or nine out of ten people who committed suicide used this rat poison to kill themselves. Recently, a new trick has emerged, and the suicide method of taking sleeping pills has become popular. For example, the famous writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. In addition, there has always been a suicide method of using the railroad as a pillow (the Japanese call it "railway suicide"), but because the death is too tragic, it cannot become very popular. Thus, the suicide is dominated by this kind of fashion, which is not</p>

<p>their intention. It can be said that it illustrates the extreme suggestibility and imitative nature of human beings. As for the suicide methods in China, the most common is taking poison, and most of them take opium. If we pay attention to the local news, we can understand this. According to the statistics of the Social Bureau, in the 265 suicide cases in July of the 18th year, 215 were by poisoning, accounting for 83.98% of the total, 10 by hanging, 21 by drowning, 2 by stabbing themselves, and 8 by swallowing gold.</p>
<p>If we talk about the psychology of suicide, we are not psychology experts, so we not only dare not say anything, but also have nothing to say. However, we can copy some excerpts from the suicide writer Ryunosuke Akutagawa's last letter, "Letter to an Old Friend," for reference (according to Shen Duanxian's translation):</p>
<p>"No one has ever realistically described the psychology of a suicide. This is probably because of the suicide's self-esteem or the suicide's lack of interest in his own psychology. I want to express this psychology very clearly in this last letter to you, although I may not tell you the motives for suicide. Renier, in his short story, described a suicide, but the protagonist in this short story does not know why he committed suicide. You can find many motives for suicide in the third page of the newspaper, such as financial difficulties, pain, or mental anguish, but according to my experience, these are not all of the motives, but only the process of expressing these motives. Most people who commit suicide, like the one described by Renier, do not know why they are committing suicide. This is the same as our behavior in general, which contains complex motives, but my suicide is at most a vague unease, an unspeakable and vague unease. You may not believe my words, but my years of experience have taught me that people who are close to me, as long as they are not in a similar situation to me, listen to my words like songs in the wind. Therefore, I do not want to blame you either. In the past two years, I have been thinking about death. In a calm mood, I have been reading Maerlinte. During this period, Maerlinte cleverly described the morality of dying with abstract words, but I want to describe the same thing more concretely. Compassion for my family is not enough to be considered before this desire. This probably sounds inhumane to you, but if it is inhumane, then one side of me is indeed inhumane. I have a duty to describe everything realistically. The first thing I think about is how to die without pain. Hanging is certainly a means that is consistent with this purpose, but when I imagine my appearance after I hang myself, I cannot help but feel a kind of 'aesthetic aversion': Drowning is not a solution for those of us who can swim. Even if it succeeds, the pain must be greater than hanging. Stabbing and I will feel an aesthetic aversion. Using a gun or a knife, because of the trembling of my hands, there is a possibility of failure. Jumping from a high building is certainly not good-looking. For these reasons, I decided to use medicine. Suicide by medicine is probably more painful than hanging, but this method, in addition to not having an aesthetic aversion, also has the advantage of not having the danger of resuscitation. However, it is certainly not easy for me to buy this kind of medicine. After I decided to commit suicide in my heart, I took advantage of every opportunity to look for this kind of medicine, and at the same time, I wanted to seek a little knowledge of toxicology. The second thing I thought about was the problem of the place of death. My family must rely on my inheritance after my death. My inheritance is only one hundred ping of land, my house, my copyright, and two thousand yuan in savings. I am worried that in the future, no one will want to buy my house because of my suicide, and I feel envy for the rich people who have villas. You must find this funny, and I myself find this funny, but in fact, when I think of this, I feel deeply inconvenienced, and on the one hand, I cannot avoid this inconvenience. I only want to not let people other than my family see my body after I commit suicide. I do not regard suicide as a sin like the red-haired people. The Buddha even affirmed his disciple's suicide in the Agama Sutra, and the sycophants explain this affirmation as only applicable to times of desperation, but in the eyes of third parties, 'times of desperation' are not tragic and hopeless times when death is the only option. People who commit suicide always commit suicide in 'times of desperation.' It can be said that it takes courage to commit suicide before times of desperation, because we humans are human beasts, afraid of death like animals. The so-called vitality is really another name for animal power. I am a human beast, but judging from the fact that I am already tired of eating and sex, my animal power has probably gradually disappeared. I am now living in a world of ice-cold and clear nerves. If we can be content with eternal sleep, then even if it cannot be regarded as happiness for ourselves, it can also be regarded as peace." We will not talk about the suicide of a writer like Akutagawa for the time being, and in fact, we are not qualified to speak. However, I have some opinions on general suicide. "Suicide is cowardly." This is certainly true in a certain sense. Some people think that they should commit suicide if everything in the world cannot go as they wish. This is too cowardly. There are also some ignorant women who want to take their own lives because of some small quarrels or being scolded. That is really ridiculous and pitiful. Try asking yourself, "Are those worthless things like quarrels and scolding worth my life?" Then you will understand. To commit suicide because of a quarrel or being scolded may be the highest means of coercion against the other party, but if you die, where is your coercion then? If you are heartbroken, I think you can use this heartbreak as a stimulant to boost your courage. If your career fails, I think you can use this failure as experience and as a weapon for advancement. Don't you remember that "failure is the mother of success"? If you commit suicide because of family problems, then your descendants will probably commit suicide because of family problems for generations. If you feel that your family is not good and that China's family system is very bad, then you should pluck up your courage to reform your own family and start a revolution in China's family system. If you must take the path of suicide, then please think again, is this kind of thing worth my life? Is my life only worth this much? When you really get to the city of unjust deaths or are about to step into the city of unjust deaths, don't you know what regrets will arise? I advise those who want to take the path of suicide to pluck up their courage and try again. If you still feel that you must die, then die.</p>
