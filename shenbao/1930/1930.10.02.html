<p>時評</p>
<h3>墨西哥移民新法</h3>
<p>於此商業不振之潮流中。欲維持本國人之生計。不得不設法限制他國人之侵奪其生計。猶之欲維持本國之貨。使暢銷國内。不得不設法減少外貨之輸入。無二理也。蓋國内之人。旣多失業。若再加以外國人之耐勞而省工資者。奪其能自工作之業。則失業之人。當然愈覺衆多。故於此無法挽救失業之際而思及限制外僑入境。亦理想中應有之一事也。</p>
<p>近來南洋各地。迭頒取締華僑之苛例。加拿大亦下令除來自有特别契約國外。亞洲人一槪禁止入境。并將前僑務官所下合法工人與眷屬得酌許入境之訓令。亦以閣令撤銷。至於美國。近亦爲減少工人失業計。已由國務院訓令國外各領事。愼發護照加緊制力能作工之外人入境。墨西哥之排斥外僑。先通令調查其入境合法與否。手續苟稍不完。即勒令出境。今又公布新移民法。限制入境更嚴。且不容於彼而送回者已不少矣。夫美墨對於色種人之入境。限制本嚴。今爲維持其本國人生活。而復厲行其苛細之法律。彼蓋謂少一外人侵奪其工作。即多一國人恢復其工作。自信必可挽回刦運於萬一。殊不知此種消極之方法。有裨於本國人之生計甚微。而所失國際間之感情與人類之同情心則甚大。蓋僑民之遠游異國兾藉其勞力或小營業。以圖一身一家之生存者已甚不易乃或甫足自立。或甫登彼岸。而即被放逐於種種苛酷之法令。使陷於進退維谷之窘境。欲謀自生而不惜陷人於絶地。亦豈良心之所安哉。</p>

<p>主義之討論　其次就余個人之觀察、從事三民主義之討論、第一、先論孫先生民族主義、關於民族主義、歐洲方在骨兩種觀察、（一）侵略民族主義、即以武力征服弱小民族、是爲國際主義與社會主義所绝對反對者、（二）民族自决主義、即以民族本身要求自由獨立平等、中山先生之民族主義、乃屬於（二）者、余極端同情、極端擁護、並希望早能實現、尤望能聯合世界弱小民族、努力於世界公道眞義之建設、其次民權主義、中山先生係根據於美總統林肯之民治民有民享、多數之歐洲人、均以爲今日中國民智之低、欲逕談民權、殊非易易、但余認爲此爲一種必有之過程、故中山先生亦説、從專制至民治、應有一種過渡時期、即所謂訓政時期是也、訓政時期、受國民黨之指導、逐漸的向前發展、故絶非開倒車、余亦極表贊同、其次關於民生主義、在歐洲均譯爲社會主義、蓋民生主義大綱、處處與社會主義相似、所不同者、即在實施方法、歐洲方面、因工業發達、大資本家壓迫極烈、故社會主義、主張無産階級自已連合起來、努力奮鬥、俾達最後目的、而中山先生之民生主義、則因中國以農立國、故主勞資合作、以解糾紛、然皮因環境之不同、根本之主張、無所差異也、雙方均不理由、余十分贊同、旋講演第二國際之工作、謂最後之目標、乃求民族之平等自由博愛云云、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 熊兆豐</p>
<p>吾人的思想和行動。大都受着環境的支配。因此很多意志薄弱的青年們埋葬在環境的墟墓裏而無法自脫。</p>
<p>不論那種宗教。第一步相信在有現象的世界之外。還有一個不可目覩更加偉大與人常相交通的世界。這種觀念。是古今中外各種宗教根本的信仰。</p>
<p>人類的歷史。正像一種生存競爭的長篇紀錄。</p>
<p>人生有順境必有逆境。惟其有逆境。然後知順境之甜暢可貴。袁簡齋謂（一病始知健如仙。）的是經騐中語。</p>
<p>在研究一個問題以先。首當注意兩個方面。（一）實際問題。（二）理解問題。理解問題是由實際問題而來的。是因有實際問題而發生的。實際方面是根本的。理解方面是非根本的。因此每一問題最重要的。乃是實用的一方面。而不是理想的一方面。</p>
<p>（慷慨捐軀）在現實的社會裏。可説是數見不鮮。若講到（從容就義。）那簡直非大智大勇不辦。</p>
<p>人類比較自然是更有價值。靈性比較身體是更加尊貴。（却酬）</p>
<h3>談二異人</h3>
<p>— 郁仰周</p>
<p>怪力亂神。夫子不道。所謂六合之外。聖人存之不論也。然聖人祇存而不論。非廢而不信也。朋輩有二異人。迹其言　似驚世駭俗。而事迹昭然。不可僞飾。且斯二人滬上士大夫類多識其人。按而可稽。非若古人之可以信口雌黄。諒亦好奇者所欲聞歟。</p>
<p>一爲餘姚戚純芳先生。先生爲滬瀆巨商戚衡芳之介弟。（戚在十餘年前其名不亞於今日之虞洽卿輩。）擁資百餘萬。年四十許。忽逢異人。授以吐納導引之術。迄今七八載堅志弗輟。能納氣辟穀。日惟食紅棗數枚。及勺水而已。冬夏一絺綌。不辨寒暑。且七八載未一易。亦無積垢爲可異。學道後以資産大部助善舉。餘乃析之二子。渠則操一小舟。駕游於碧流叢翠聞。不涉世事。偶或於族中春社時一蒞臨耳。前江西省長戚揚。亦爲先生同族昆季行。云先生望之如四十許人。惟氣魄充沛。視之亦無異常人。據先生自云已能略知休咎。惟不爲人卜吉凶。且自信根基尚淺。苟孟晋不已。或可致地仙云。</p>
<p>一爲寳山袁希濓先生。（即觀瀾先生之介弟。）執律師業於滬上。先生曾得莊僧　指授密宗咒法。能驅神役鬼。一日某君爲蜈蚣所螫。痛極而暈。聞先生能治之。踵門請求。先生爲閉目持咒。召誤蚣至。而稽其與某君無宿孽寃。不應妄螫。痛斥之。蜈蚣即自投階下而死。據云如有夙孽。即爲寃怨相報。無法可施矣。觀瀾先生之夫人。亦能符咒。親友懇其施治者。亦多奇効。惟不輕以示人耳。天地之大。竟無奇不有耶。</p>
<h3>尊前話</h3>
<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>曩夜與張守彝先生飮。謂第一杯入口微苦。酒味最佳。第二杯即遜。余以爲温酒者不得其法。先生因言古時酒皆冷飲。無熱飲者。禮有浣濯尊罍之節。而不及温酒。司馬長卿與文君賣酒成都。亦止言親自滌器。唐代虢國夫人。實酒於鹿腸。結其兩頭。而懸於梁問。欲飲則去其結。而以口就吸之。夫欲飲而飲則不時可知。其冷飲更可知矣。惟白香山詩。有綠螘新醅酒。紅泥小火爐。晚來天欲雪。能飲一杯無之句。恐係酒熱飲之始。余則謂今日之酒。有兩種。一黄酒。爲米所釀。一燒酒。爲高梁所釀。黄酒大都飲熱。而燒酒則冷飲。或古時先有燒酒。而黄酒後出。故冷飲耳。錄之。以質世之好飲而考古者。</p>
<h3>後起雋才之王少樓</h3>
<p>— 徐筱汀</p>
<p>王少樓係北平名伶王毓樓之哲嗣。髦齡練戲。便爾不凡。資質旣佳取。徑亦正。昔與李萬春共支斌慶社之大厦者亘六七年。已漸露崢嶸之頭角。毓樓訓子綦嚴。尤以倒嗓一關。對於少樓所下之監護苦工爲最深。以故少樓之嗓音。得於極短期間復元而變爲今日甜圓朗潤之佳喉。終可謂獲如願以償矣。其歌純宗叔岩。心得極豐。復又親承其教益。精韻自然酷肖。試以其二年前在勝利所收之捉放曹珠簾寨烏盆計諸片。與叔岩所收者相對證。可以察其於細微曲折之處。亦未嘗離譜也。身段打武。得力於幼年之牢立基礎。自屬不弱。至若扮相之清秀。神態之俟逸。殆所謂天生妙才者是也。况值年富力强之際。又無烟霞一類之惡嗜好以是阻其上進。環境如之優越。一鳴驚人也宜矣。今春脫離斌慶社後。數與雪艶琴合演於平津。厥譽宛若旭日之騰起。已成名之鬚生。多爲所掩。黯然失色焉。程艶秋知其能。約與合演。觀者每有相得益彰之佳評。未嘗以其新進而輕略之。於是少樓之名顯矣。筱汀春間北上。連觀其與艶秋德霖壽臣妙香瑞安諸名伶合演各劇。少樓居然能不人失主角尊嚴。博得頻仍之采聲。夫以雙十之少年。竟獲如此之殊遇。少樓足以自豪也矣。此次出演滬上大舞台。除大路之文武佳劇如駡曹捉放戰太平慶頂珠等之外。尚有余派之珠簾寨定軍山法塲換子及全本借東風清官册白蟒台諸好戲。尤以與艶秋合演之法門寺探母硃痕記駡殿紅鬃烈馬全本柳迎春爲最富呌座力。滬上人士。久不獲聆叔岩之歌。今得其弟子王少樓蒞此。大可一飽耳福焉。</p>
<h3>識自怡印泥之名貴</h3>
<p>— 賀天健</p>
<p>印泥與鈐記在書畫上之重要。夫人而知之矣。雖然。鈐記縱神妙。而印泥不稱。則鈐記之妙處亦無以顯。故印泥尤在百要。自古印泥製法亦多矣。有以艾絨製者有以絲棉製者。而皆未精。進而有以柳絮製者有以野絨製者。其質佳矣。其神妙矣。在用之者以爲技窮於道。而無以復加矣而不知尚有以藕絲聞者。則誠邁古而軼今矣。窮其理而創此法者。其人即海上印泥專家夏自怡先生是。夏先生精研此道垂二十餘年。其始徒以市上所有之印泥。不能盡如人意。偶食藕而得絲。恍若有覺。遂以其絲試之。結果甚佳。若夫艾絨等製實有所不殆。於是乃配以鍊金美麗劈砂及數十年之陳油。其神妙之特徵。乃能不耗油。不粘滯。着鈐不滋。用後石上無渣滓膠滯。而所刻之文。在紙上能積起秒餘。四面起邊。美觀異常。而於印泥可謂歎觀止矣。又有野絨一種其妙處亦能超越其他。比之藕絲。亦能不相上下。先生所製共有神妙高精超優上佳八種。藕絲即神品。而野絨則爲妙品。夫其所以克臻此境者。蓋於研砂擘絲理絨拌泥調油之事。先生皆親手爲之。不假手於他人。故其弊病絶無。况先生並不以此牟利。徒以友朋相促乃以問世。蓋君子不獨善其身。所謂與人樂樂者也。余有印泥凡七八種。鈐用時每苦有所不足。蓋一畫旣成。心神非常愉快，苟印泥而不稱，便覺掃興。及得夏先生藕絲印泥。即雖次一等者。而腥紅圓瀝。湛明若紅豆之色。於拙畫增色不少。於是乃知天地間靈秘無窮。要在吾人探討得之耳。</p>
<h3>家庭新識</h3>

<h3>芬蘭農民之反共運動（三）</h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>（二）拉普亞運動之結果</p>
<p>各地反共組織成立愈多。對於妨止共黨活動之方法亦日有進步。其初不過要求政府限制共黨出版結會之自由。使其宣傳方面不能如以前順暢。繼而宣布共黨乃愛國的破壞的政黨。凡隸屬共黨之議員及市參事等均應所消其出席權。最後進而主張修改現行憲法。使共黨永無插足國會及各市參事會之機會。以下乃拉普亞運動代表機關提交芬蘭大總統之决議案。</p>
<p>「共黨之印刷機關及執紙應立即封閉。</p>
<p>不論在何種形式下之共黨組織應立即解散。</p>
<p>共黨辦事人員及其重要份子應立即拘禁。</p>
<p>立法選舉應俟上述條件實行。全國安寗回復後舉行。」</p>
<p>拉普亟運動之指導者。更特作如下之聲明。</p>
<p>「爲糾正對於反共運動之種種浮言起見。吾人聲明如下。在奥斯托洛波特里南部。吾人所攻擊者祗有一件。即共産主義是也。外間不明眞相。或誤作凡西斯主義。或以爲欲推翻憲法實行狄克推多。均屬錯誤。吾人將盡力爲吾人之目的而奮戰。不許有任何障害及困難爲吾人前途之阻。」</p>
<p>拉普亞運動在短時期中集成之力量。於本年七月七日赫爾新基（Helsinki）大會表現無遺。自全國各處來參加此會之農民凡一萬二千人。芬蘭大總統亦到會作愛國演説。内閣全體及獨立戰爭之勝利者孟勒亨將軍均聯袂蒞止。</p>
<p>在赫爾新基大會之前數日。政府曾召集國會。欲以合法手腕實現拉普亞運動之主張。提出數種修改現行憲法之議案於國會。其内容大約爲妨止企圖改變國體之政黨加入立法機關。並將集會出版等自由加以限制。第二次集會。多數議員對於政府提案均表示赞成。但第三次集會。國會竟决議將上述議案留待下届選舉後辦理。於是芬蘭總統宣布解散國會。下届選舉定於十月一日舉行。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>條件旣已妥貼。更使翠筠無可非難。可是一進了門。便種種磨難逐漸而來第一件。就是章乙青的態度大變。住在外面的時候。雖然三分天下有其一。那每月十天的功夫。倒像是伊專有的。而且章乙青在初得新寵幾個月。謝絶了花間交游。凡是新納寵的人。都是如此。指天誓日。再不在外胡調的了。過了一年半載。漸漸覺得單調。又想在外活動了。自從翠筠搬回去以後。他好像一件東西。所有權旣歸他有。便已放心。旣得隴又望蜀了。又好似欲得一件心愛的古物。旣已得到手中。便可置諸高閣。總之他是不怕被别人奪去。却在起别種野心。所以始而回來得遲一點。到後來依然花天酒地。沉酣在外面了。第二件。就是章乙青這個女人。情形也和翠筠初搬回來的時候。有些不同了。最先原是説什麽姊妹稱呼的。但是伊從來不曾把什麽姊妹之禮相待。有許多家裏的事。倒教翠筠去做。翠筠雖然幾年來身入平康。可是從小在家庭中也曾操持過的。此刻旣然是做了人家人子。也高興做一點家庭間事。後來又教伊裝鴉片烟。伊到也不推辭。原來上海堂子裏出身的姑娘。都是會裝鴉片烟的。伊雖不能吸。却最喜歡弄着玩。伊想我自已横竪不吸。給伊裝裝。没有什麽要緊。可是就此一裝。竟永遠要給伊裝了。伊先把向來給伊裝烟的阿寳歇掉。伊説省一個人。也省一點開消。一面又告訴翠筠。説阿寳用不得。伊和老爺弔膀子弔成功了。擺在家裏。終是一個禍根。不如早早開除伊走路爲妙。其實阿寳本來也不高興在這裏的了。白天裝裝烟。倒也没有什麽。就是那晚上。深更半夜。有時竟要到天亮。倘然章乙青住在翠筠那裏。要喚翠筠去睡。伊就要不高興。就没有好臉子給伊看。有時在背後。就和傭人們説翠筠是個狐狸精一般。在那裏迷惑男人。所以章乙青來喚翠筠時。翠筠覺得不好意思就走。到得伊吸足了鴉片烟。方可去睡。至少須在半夜。章乙青有時要喚翠筠。伊便索性和他搶白起來。嚇得章乙青不敢開口。到了那時。翠筠愈加覺得不好意思走。從此每夜非到半夜或者天亮。不能去睡。成爲一個定例。章乙青覺討了一個翠筠來。被伊所用。好似買了砲仗被别人放。</p>

<h3>The Port of Weihaiwei Formally Handed Over</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ceremony Marked the Official Transfer</p>
<p>Instruments of Ratification Exchanged Between China and Britain</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jiazhen and Xu Zushan, in a telegram dated the 1st: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that they arrived in Weihaiwei at 10:00 AM today and immediately proceeded with the handover ceremony according to the original plan. After the ceremony, the British Commissioner departed for Shanghai by ship. Zhu Shiquan, an assistant in the European and American Affairs Department, also telegraphed that Vice Minister Wang and Commissioner Xu arrived in Weihaiwei at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 1st. Over three thousand representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and various civic groups welcomed them at the port. The British Commissioner, the Naval Commander, along with all administrative officials and army and navy personnel, greeted them at the dock. British warships fired salutes. At 10:50 AM, they proceeded with the Commissioner to the former British Public Office for the handover ceremony. After the Commissioner read several clauses from the special treaty, the flag-raising ceremony took place. A tea party was then held, where Chinese and British dignitaries gathered, truly a grand occasion. The Commissioner boarded the HMS Centaur at 11:45 AM to return to Shanghai. (Special dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the instruments of ratification for the Special Treaty for the Handover of Weihaiwei and the Agreement for the Lease of Liugong Island were exchanged on the morning of the 1st, both parties telegraphed the handover commissioner Wang Jiazhen and British Naval Admiral Jonston to hold the handover ceremony at 10:30 AM.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>New Mexican Immigration Law</h3>
<p>In this current trend of economic downturn, to maintain the livelihood of one's own people, it is necessary to find ways to limit the encroachment of others on that livelihood. Similarly, to maintain the sales of one's own country's goods domestically, it is necessary to find ways to reduce the import of foreign goods. The principle is the same. If many people within a country are already unemployed, and then foreign workers who are hard-working and accept low wages further take away jobs, the number of unemployed people will naturally increase. Therefore, in the face of an inability to reverse unemployment, considering limiting the entry of foreigners is one of the things that should be considered.</p>
<p>Recently, various regions in Southeast Asia have repeatedly issued harsh regulations targeting overseas Chinese. Canada has also issued an order prohibiting the entry of all Asians, except those from countries with special agreements. Moreover, the instructions previously issued by overseas Chinese affairs officials allowing legal workers and their families to enter at their discretion have also been revoked by cabinet order. As for the United States, in order to reduce worker unemployment, the State Department has instructed consulates abroad to carefully issue passports and intensify efforts to prevent foreigners who can work from entering the country. Mexico's exclusion of foreigners began with a general order to investigate whether their entry was legal. If the procedures were slightly incomplete, they were ordered to leave the country. Now, a new immigration law has been announced, making entry restrictions even stricter, and many who are not allowed to stay and are being sent back are already numerous. The United States and Mexico have always had strict restrictions on the entry of people of color. Now, in order to maintain the livelihood of their own people, they are strictly enforcing their harsh and detailed laws. They believe that with one less foreigner taking their jobs, one more of their own people will regain their jobs, and they are confident that they can reverse the situation even by a small margin. However, they do not realize that this kind of passive method has very little benefit for the livelihood of their own people, but the loss of international feelings and human sympathy is very great. It is already very difficult for overseas residents to travel to foreign countries, hoping to use their labor or small businesses to seek a livelihood for themselves and their families. However, they are either barely able to support themselves or have just arrived on the other side of the ocean, and are immediately banished by all kinds of harsh laws, putting them in a difficult situation. To seek their own survival without hesitating to put others in a desperate situation, is this something that can be done with a clear conscience?</p>

<h3>Zhang Majie Heads to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>To Plan the Reorganization of the Northwest Situation</p>

<p>(Nanjing) It seems to be true that the former commander of the Northwest Army's forward troops, Lu Zhonglin, has requested Jiang to submit to the Central Government. Zhang Zhijiang, the former leader of the Northwest Army, came to Beijing from Shanghai this morning and met with Ma Fuxiang for several hours. He departed from Pukou for the front lines this evening at 6:00 PM. According to reliable information from Chinese sources, the conditions for compromise proposed by Lu Zhonglin are: 1. Feng Yuxiang will step down and travel abroad. 2. The Central Government will provide special facilities for Feng to go abroad. 3. The Northwest Army will be under the control of Lu Zhonglin, and will be reorganized into ten divisions in accordance with the resolutions of the Disbandment Conference, with part of Henan and Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia as their territory. 4. The Central Government will provide 3 million yuan for disbandment expenses. Some believe that this sudden proposal from the Northwest Army is Feng's trick, but according to those familiar with the situation, since the Jin Army withdrew from Hebei, the Northwest Army has been suffering from the supply of military expenses and supplies. The leaders of the Northwest Army held an emergency meeting in Kaifeng on the 28th and decided that the general trend was to submit to the Central Government.

<h3>German Financial Plan</h3>
<p>General Reduction of Civil Servants' Salaries</p>
<p>Striving for Frugality in the Budget</p>
<p>The Government is Determined to Implement It</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 30th) German Chancellor Dr. Brüning presented the government's financial procedures to President Hindenburg today. The purpose of the procedures is to try to make up for the budget shortfall of 37.5 million pounds caused by unemployment and reduced tax revenue and to prevent this year's shortage. It is reported that cabinet members' salaries will be reduced by 12%, national civil servants will have their salaries reduced by 6%, unemployment insurance tax will be increased to 6.5%, and a surtax of 5% will be levied on the income of unmarried men and women. It is expected that tobacco tax can increase revenue by 8 million pounds, and government departments' administrative expenses can be reduced by 15 million pounds. The new parliament, which will be convened on October 13th, will reject this procedure. If so, President Hindenburg will allow the government to implement it and order the parliament to adjourn until next spring.</p>
<p>(Kokumin, Berlin, 30th) The comprehensive plan for financial and administrative reform drafted by the German government, with the consent of the president, was announced this afternoon. It briefly stated that in view of the recent development of events, it is increasingly believed that all price increases since the European War, if not promptly prevented, will soar endlessly. Germany, with the low prices in the world market and the high domestic production costs, coupled with the heavy burden of reparations, is already in a very dangerous and difficult situation and must make particularly determined efforts to reduce national administrative and production costs so as to promote industry and commerce and absorb most of the unemployed. The first chapter discusses methods to make up for the budget deficit. This year, tax revenue has been short, and the sharp increase in unemployment has led to a continuous increase in expenses such as the government's unemployment insurance fund, causing the government's income and expenditure to fall short of the original budget by 800 million marks. The proposed method to make up for this is to issue short-term public bonds, to be repaid within three years, and to increase unemployment insurance premiums from 4.5% to 6.5%, borne equally by employers and employees. In addition, it is proposed to reform the current unemployment policy and regulations to ensure that the unemployment insurance fund is separated from the national treasury in the future and is completely independent in order to seek the stability of national finances and prevent temporary squeezes due to labor problems. Secondly, it is proposed to generally reduce the salaries and pensions of all civil servants by 6%. Thirdly, it is proposed to strictly review the budgets of various municipalities to ensure that they are as frugal as possible and use the remaining revenue to reduce taxes. In addition, there are several points such as the agricultural relief plan and the national food supply method. Finally, it is solemnly stated that the government is well aware that this reform plan will cause great inconvenience to all parties, but at this critical moment of survival, if no rescue is attempted, it will surely lead to great mistakes and it will be too late for regrets. Therefore, the government will do its utmost to implement it. The newspapers have not yet commented on this plan, but political circles here say that its last sentence is noteworthy, showing that if the parliament cannot pass it, the cabinet will ask the president to promulgate it by order in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution. It is still difficult to predict whether this case has a chance of passing in the parliament, but it is heard that Prime Minister Brüning once said to the leaders of the various parties that this case should be accepted in whole or rejected in whole, and not passed on some items and rejected on some items. He also said that he welcomes cooperation on this case, regardless of the attitudes of the various parties on purely political issues.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Assembly Passes China's Proposal</h3>
<p>Demanding that All Countries Joining the Treaty Take</p>

<p>Germany, Austria, and Hungary Did Not Vote on the Disarmament Proposal</p>
<p>(Kokumin, Geneva, 1st) The League of Nations Assembly this morning expressed its extreme satisfaction with the results of the 1925 Opium Convention, because since the conclusion of the convention, the number of countries signing it has been the largest. In addition to those who have already joined, there are currently eleven countries successively notifying their willingness to join. Chinese representatives also presented a proposal in the assembly, demanding that all countries joining the treaty impose stricter punishments on opium traffickers, and that those who have not fully adopted the provisions of the treaty should conduct strict investigations into the opium trade within their countries and report the results to the League of Nations. This proposal was passed by the assembly. Subsequently, the assembly decided to invite member states and non-member states of the League of Nations to participate in the international conference scheduled to be convened in May 1931 to jointly discuss plans to reject the prevalence of drug addiction.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Geneva, 30th) The League of Nations Assembly today passed the report and proposal on disarmament, but the representatives of Germany, Austria, and Hungary did not vote because the date for holding the disarmament conference was not specified. French Foreign Minister Briand said that he was confident that the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, which will be held in November, will promote its work. British representative Cecil said that he very much hoped that the disarmament conference would be held as soon as possible, but the date should not be predetermined, fearing the danger of postponing the meeting. He believed that the conference could be held next year, but he did not want to say that it would definitely be held.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Geneva, 30th) The League of Nations Assembly today passed the report of the Sixth Committee on the issue of protecting ethnic minorities.

<p>(Pacific, Geneva, 30th) The report on the achievements of the current session of the League of Nations Assembly has been completed.

<h3>British Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held Yesterday</p>
<p>MacDonald Chairs the Conference</p>
<p>(Kokumin, London, 1st) The Royal Conference convened in England by the British government, attended by representatives from various colonies, was officially held in the reception hall of the British Foreign Office this morning. British Prime Minister MacDonald was elected as the chairman. Subsequently, the prime ministers of the various colonies jointly read out their declaration of unanimous loyalty to the British Emperor. After the reading, MacDonald delivered his welcome speech to the representatives of the various colonies and briefly outlined the main tasks to be discussed at the conference. Afterwards, a closed-door meeting was held, and the contents were unknown to outsiders. (Reuters, London, 1st) British newspapers commented on the Imperial Conference. The Times said that the Imperial Conference of 1926 was dominated by the concept of status, while the Imperial Conference that opened today will be dominated by the concept of cooperation. It is expected that the biggest difficulty the conference will encounter may be the tariff issue. Some British cabinet members still hold free trade theories, and their influence may prevent the conference from making great progress towards mutual tariffs. However, the current preferential tariff system is unlikely to be abolished. The Daily Mail said that the conference is a business-oriented meeting, aiming at practical and concrete results. Last night, British Prime Minister Chairman held a government banquet to welcome the representatives of overseas autonomous regions.</p>

In recent months, public sentiment has been quite agitated. Opponents of President Machado claim that the president is merely a puppet controlled by powerful American capitalists.</p>

<p>Pacific dispatch, Riga, 30th: A Russian fleet, including one cruiser and two torpedo boats, will cruise the Mediterranean and refuel on the coasts of Constantinople, Greece, and Italy.</p>
<h3>Soviet Reply to Finnish Note</h3>
<p>An Extremely Strong Stance</p>
<p>Pacific dispatch, Moscow, 30th: People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov recently replied to the Finnish envoy's note of September 16th, stating that the Finnish government had expelled its citizens from Soviet Russia. The Soviet government had raised a protest on July 16th. The note of September 16th stated that the expulsion of citizens was due to the "received country" movement, and that they were expelled towards the Soviet Russian border due to the contiguity of the two countries. Such language, regarding the violation of the Soviet Russian border, is intended to justify the invasion of Soviet Russia. If Finland allows the expelled people to return to their country, Soviet Russia will not obstruct it; otherwise, the Soviet government will consider Finland to have no intention of maintaining neighborly relations. This matter is a scene from the Lapua anti-[Communist] movement, and the Soviet attitude is quite strong.</p>

<h3>Northeastern Army Advances Towards the Pinghan and Pingsui Lines</h3>
<p>Investigation of the Organization and Strength of the First Army</p>
<p>Beiping correspondence: The first batch of the Northeastern Army to move towards Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), Yu Xuezhong's First Army, completed mobilization by the night of the 25th. Wang Shuchang's Second Army began arriving in Tianjin on the 26th. It is said that these so-called First and Second Armies are not fixed designations, but rather are formed according to wartime corps organization. The First Army is composed of four infantry brigades, with an attached cavalry regiment and other configurations of engineer, transport, signal, and aviation units, roughly following the example of a Japanese wartime division. The Second Army is composed of three infantry brigades, plus one artillery regiment, with other engineer, transport, signal, and aviation units also like the First Army. There is also a Third Army, with Hu Yukun designated as the army commander. The unit has a prepared organization, but whether or not it will actually mobilize depends on the situation. If it is not urgently needed, mobilization will be halted, because Zhang Xueliang has adopted the military strategy decided by the Northeast Supreme Military Council, which is, as a first step, to have the First Army responsible for Beiping and its surroundings, and the Second Army responsible for Tianjin, the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, and a section of the Jinwan Railway. If there is a need to actively advance towards Baoding and other places along the Pinghan Railway, or if there is a possibility of war, then the second step would be to order the Third Army to move out, at which time the First Army would be moved to the Pinghan Railway. As far as the current situation is concerned, this is not yet under consideration, so whether Hu Yukun's Third Army will actually be organized and sent out is currently undecided. However, even considering only the First and Second Armies, their strength is already considerable. It is found that Yu's First Army's four brigades are actually equivalent to four formal divisions (the Northeastern Army abolished the division system after entering the Northeast in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], with the brigade being the highest peacetime unit; after the war against Russia last year, it was planned to restore the division system, but the reorganization costs were not finalized). Each brigade has an actual strength of between 10,000 and 11,700 men, and many were reorganized from previous armies or divisions. For example, the current Sixth Brigade of the First Army, under Li Zhentang, was formed by downsizing the former Eighth Army led by Wan Fulin. After Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping on the 26th, he held a military meeting with the four brigade commanders under his command at the headquarters in Tieshizi Hutong (the original site of Yan Xishan's Pingjin Garrison Headquarters) to properly allocate the stationing of the four brigades. (1) The entire 23rd Brigade (the old brigade commander was Ma Tingfu), which Yu concurrently commands, consisting of three regiments and six independent companies, will have one regiment stationed in the Temple of Heaven within Beiping city, and the six independent companies stationed at the old Navy Department (next door to the Garrison Headquarters). The other two regiments, one in Tianjin and one in Tangshan, are now being ordered to move entirely to the Pingjin Railway because Wang Shuchang's Second Army has already begun moving. (2) The entire 27th Brigade of Liu Naichang will be distributed from Fengtai Railway Station as a starting point, at key points along the Pinghan Railway such as Fengtai, Lugouqiao, Changxindian, Liangxiang, and Liulihe, taking a posture of waiting for orders to advance. (3) The entire Sixth Brigade of Li Zhentang will be distributed from the Xiyuan in the northwestern suburbs of Beiping, along the Pingsui Railway, at Qinghe, Shahe, Changping, and other places, all the way to Nankou. (4) The entire Fifth Brigade of Dong Yingbin will be stationed entirely within Beiping city and the Tongzhou area in the eastern suburbs. The above is the overall deployment of Yu's army. Analytically speaking, the task of Liu Naichang's and Li Zhentang's brigades is one for the Pinghan Railway and one for the Pingsui Railway, while the brigades of Dong Yingbin and Yu Xuezhong are concentrated in Beiping and are temporarily responsible for security. At the moment, general attention is being paid to the advancing actions of Liu's and Li's brigades, because the Jin army, which has retreated from various places west of Zhuozhou on the Pinghan Railway and north of Nankou on the Pingsui Railway, is gathering, and there seems to be no sign of continuing to yield defense. If the Northeastern Army's Liu and Li units actively advance, no one knows whether conflicts will arise. Yu Xuezhong issued a declaration yesterday upon arriving in Beiping, stating that if the other side peacefully yields, they will definitely not force it, so it is not possible to predict whether there will be any conflicts in the short term. Furthermore, according to the explanation of a certain Northeastern Army officer, the First Army's Liu and Li brigades being dispatched to Changxindian, Shahe, and other places along the Pinghan and Pingsui lines cannot be simply regarded as military actions of advancing towards the two lines, because those places are adjacent to Beiping and are defensive deployments that are essential for those guarding Beiping.

<h3>After the Northeastern Army Arrived in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: The Fifth Brigade, Sixth Brigade, Twenty-Third Brigade, Twenty-Seventh Brigade, and Second Cavalry Brigade of the Northeastern Army under Yu Xuezhong had completely arrived in the Pingjin area by noon on the 25th. Yesterday (the 24th), the security of this city was officially taken over by the Tenth Regiment of the Twenty-Third Brigade, under Li Choushan. Although there are still two remaining battalions of Jin army military police who have not left, they have already transported their weapons onto trains and will leave Tianjin for Shijiazhuang this afternoon. Yesterday morning, I went to the Beining Railway Bureau to visit Jiang Chunyan, Yu Xuezhong's representative. Jiang said that the defense of Beiping has been equipped and prepared. The Fifth Brigade and Sixth Brigade are responsible for the defense of the inner and outer cities of Beiping. The Twenty-Seventh Brigade is stationed in Fengtai and Changxindian. The Second Cavalry Brigade is stationed in Changping. The Twenty-Third Brigade is also stationed in Beiping, but the Tenth Regiment will remain temporarily responsible for the defense of Tianjin. After Wang Shuchang's Second Army arrives in Tianjin, the Tenth Regiment will leave for Beiping. While Mr. Jiang was talking, he was reading various telegrams, appearing very busy.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Northeastern Army in Tianjin, changes in personnel in various agencies are naturally to be expected. Lu Jinli, who concurrently served as the Acting Customs Commissioner, was eager to unload his responsibilities. On the 22nd, he was replaced by the original Customs Commissioner, Bi Luo. Zhang Yi, the director of the Jilu District Wheat Flour Special Tax Bureau, had already left his post. Chen Cengliang, the deputy director, was also not responsible. Former Secretary Shao Mingsheng received a telegram from Shanghai from Sun Qun, the former director, saying that he had received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to return to his post immediately. Shao then went to take over at 3:00 PM on the 23rd, and Chen handled the handover. In addition, the former Director of the Telephone Bureau, Chen Tirong, and the former Director of the Telegraph Bureau, Duanmu Bangfan, have not been able to fulfill their wishes because the current directors are unwilling to hand over.</p>
<p>The Hebei and Shanxi banks both experienced runs on the 21st. The Shanxi Bank announced its closure the next day (the 22nd). All the large and small banknotes circulating on the market, amounting to more than 150,000 yuan, were originally entrusted to the Zhongjiao and other banks for redemption and collection. Zhongjiao did not agree. The General Chamber of Commerce is currently handling the registration of the bank's banknotes. If it does not exceed 150,000 yuan, Zhongjiao and other banks may be able to redeem them. As for the Hebei Bank, since the day of the run, it has been redeeming without restrictions. Today is the fourth day, and there are not many banknotes circulating on the market. Its credit is actually better. A run also occurred at the Quan'ye Bank on the 23rd. It has now announced a one-week suspension of redemption, pending the arrival of funds from Shanghai, after which it will redeem. A run also occurred at the Agricultural and Industrial Bank on the 24th. Fortunately, it received strong assistance from the Zhongjiao and other banks, and it is hoped that it will subside. Liu Naichang, brigade commander of the Twenty-Seventh Brigade of the Da Zhongken Northeastern First Army.</p>
<p>The banknotes of the Yeliang banks were rejected by the market yesterday, and runs also occurred today. Recalling the changes in the situation in the past, turmoil is bound to occur in the financial world. The runs on various banks this time are also a phenomenon that should be expected. (Morning of September 25th)</p>
<h3>A Record of Inspecting the Lub North Battlefield</h3>
<p>From Jinan to Sangyuan</p>
<p>Jinan message: The Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge. Before the Hebei Jin army retreated, Han Fuqu ordered Wei Jinglu, the leader of the Second Squad of the First Battalion of the Railway Team of the Second Transportation Corps, to be responsible for planning the repairs. After receiving the order, Leader Wei sent a car to Pukou to transport the originally unloaded materials and dispatched workers with the engineer Hu Shenghong of the Jinpu Railway. The Jin army withdrew on the 23rd. Leader Wei and Engineer Hu immediately went to supervise the repairs. The original intention was that it would take ten days to complete the project. Fortunately, the materials were available, and the General Headquarters telegraphed the Jiaoji Railway to borrow a crane, so construction began on the 25th and was completed early on the 27th. After the Luokou Bridge was repaired, Leader Wei and Engineer Hu prepared a special train early on the 27th, with thirteen material cars loaded with road repair materials, and took a team of more than one hundred engineers, departing from Jinan Station at 10:00 AM. (Since the Jin army withdrew from Jinan on August 15th, this is the first time a train has passed north of Jinan in more than forty days.) In addition to Wei and Hu, those traveling with the train included Li Yuhui, deputy to the Second Squad; Zhang Yuanhe, the head of the Jinan Locomotive Depot; (inspecting the route) Section Chief He of the General Affairs Office of the Pukou Railway Administration; Mao Qihuan, head of the Jinan Traffic Department (Mao was ordered by the Ministry of Railways to go to Tianjin to take over the Railway Administration, which was the original office, and Engineer Hu was also ordered to go with him. It is said that the deputy director of the Railway, Zhu Shuyun, has gone to Tianjin by sea to be responsible for the takeover). In order to understand the situation in Lub North, I discussed it with the railway team and received their consent to go north with the train. When the train arrived at Luokou, the Beiping armored train was on the bridge. After the Beiping train reversed, the special train went onto the bridge at 11:30 AM and slowly tested the train, arriving at the northern end of the bridge at 11:50 AM. (According to the regulations on the bridge, the speed must not exceed five miles per hour.) The crane was pulled back to the southern end, and after changing to a special train, it did not start until 1:30 PM. It arrived at Sangzidian at 2:00 PM and stopped slightly, arriving at Yancheng at 2:30 PM without stopping, and arriving at Yucheng at 3:30 PM, stopping to take on water. I got off the train to inspect and saw trenches densely distributed on both sides of the Tuhai River (according to the battle traces of the Han army guarding Yucheng), with new graves piled up, and countless civilian houses destroyed nearby. Among the losses along the way, this place suffered the most. The train departed at 4:00 PM, arriving at Zhangzhuang at 4:30 PM for a brief stop, and arriving at Pingyuan at 5:00 PM to stop. Sun Tongxuan, commander of the Twelfth Army, and Li Hanzhang, commander of the Eighty-Fifth Brigade, happened to be at the station. I presented my card to visit. Brigade Commander Li said that his brigade arrived in Shanghe on the 25th, and it was reported that a large part of Gao Guizi was in Leling. Because this brigade was ordered to concentrate in Pingyuan, it was inconvenient to divide the team to pursue. On the 26th, they passed Linzi and happened to encounter another unit of Gao's rebels, which they immediately surrounded, capturing more than two hundred people and seizing their weapons. They arrived in Pingyuan on the 27th, and this brigade was stationed in Pingyuan, waiting for further orders. Tang Yaoxun's unit of the Sixty-Fifth Brigade of the Twenty-Second Division was ordered to pursue Gao Guizi's unit and has now advanced to Wuding. Division Commander Gu (Liangmin) of the Twenty-Second Division led Ning Chunxiao's unit of the Sixty-Sixth Brigade and has arrived at the Yellow River Cliff, from where they will transfer to Dezhou. Army Commander Sun said that his unit arrived in Pingyuan on the 26th, and the army headquarters was located in the city. The directly subordinate units included an artillery regiment, a mortar regiment, and a company each of engineers, cavalry, and pistols. In addition, the entire Eighty-Fifth Brigade was ordered not to go to Dezhou temporarily. The unit in Yucheng was Ma Jingong's unit of the Sixtieth Brigade of this division. The Third Regiment was stationed in Yucheng, and the First Regiment was stationed in Yancheng. Zhao Xinde's unit of the Fifty-Ninth Banner of this division arrived in Dezhou on the 26th. It is rumored that the Northeastern Army has arrived in Lianzhen, but no report has been received yet. That place (Pingyuan) has not experienced war and has not suffered any losses. The special train departed at 5:00 PM, passing the old Yellow River and seeing the new trenches dug by the Jin army on both sides of the Majia River. Arriving in Dezhou at 6:30 PM, it was already dark, and the stationed troops were heavily guarded, so it was not convenient to get off the train and stayed on the train. It is estimated that there was no damage to any station or bridge along the way from Luokou to Dezhou, which was something we did not expect. The next morning (the 28th) at 8:10 AM, the engineering team attached Zhu Yupu took the original locomotive, attached one car, to Sangyuan to investigate. I also went along. Arriving in Sangyuan at 9:00 AM, that place is the border between Shandong and Hebei and is not stationed by any troops. There, I heard from the railway personnel that on the afternoon of the 27th, eight trains of the Northeastern Army arrived in Dongguang, and a small part arrived in Wuqiao County. Lianzhen and Anlingzhen will also send teams to station (but they have not arrived today). At 9:15 AM, we drove back from Sangyuan, arriving in Dezhou in thirty minutes. After I got off the train, I went to visit the stationed Brigade Commander Zhao. Zhao said that this brigade was the vanguard in this pursuit of the Jin army. At 2:30 PM on the 26th, they arrived in Dezhou from Pingyuan. Beforehand, they were ordered to resolve Qin Jianbin's new Second Division of recruits under Xie Zhendong, and they immediately took a company of men to the arsenal, disarming more than two hundred new recruits. More than one hundred people were also disarmed in Nanguan. All the prisoners who were willing to continue serving as soldiers have been selected and reorganized, and the rest have been sent back to their hometowns. The officers were all sent back to their original residences. Those stationed in Dezhou in this brigade include Zhang Tingyan's unit of the Second Regiment, Wu Yuanxing's unit of the Third Regiment, and the pistol team leader Zhang Yaode's unit. In addition, there are independent companies of engineers, mortars, and machine guns. Zhao Xiangxian's unit of the First Regiment is still in Jinan and will still be sent to the front in the coming days. In this battle, more than two thousand artillery shells and eight or nine carts were obtained in Pingyuan, capturing more than ten people. In Dezhou, forty boxes of bombs and mortar shells, one machine gun, more than ten assault machine guns, and more than one hundred rifles were obtained. This brigade was ordered to be stationed in Dezhou temporarily. Now Zhang Tiansheng, the new director of the Dezhou Public Security Bureau, has arrived, and Sun Tongfeng, the new county magistrate, has been additionally appointed. (It is said that Sun Tongxuan recommended him.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>He will arrive in Dezhou today.) Today, the special train from Jinan to Dezhou has arrived, and the county magistrates and public security directors along the route have all arrived with the train. It is heard that three trains of the Northeastern Army have arrived in Dongguang. The railway team's special train was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Han not to leave the Shandong border, so it departed from Dezhou at 0:20 PM today, stopping briefly in Pingyuan at 1:10 PM, not stopping in Zhangzhuang at 2:10 PM, and arriving in Yancheng at 3:30 PM, when the Beiping armored train arrived from Jinan and will go to Sangyuan. The special train arrived in Jinan at 4:50 PM, and I also returned to Jinan with the train. It is heard that Mao Qihuan, the head of the Jinan Traffic Department, telegraphed from Dezhou to Jinan this morning, ordering the seventh and eighth trains from Jinan to Yanzhou to be changed to the ninth and tenth trains between Jinan and Dezhou. However, it is impossible to satisfy one without harming the other, and it is not yet known whether it can be realized. As for the issue of the Tianjin-Jinan through train, because there are currently no vehicles, it must be decided after the Director of the Railway Administration, Sun Hegao, has consulted with the authorities in Tianjin.

<h3>Jiao Railway Employee He Zhusan Arrested</h3>
<p>Qingdao correspondence: He Zhusan, a clerk in the Electrical Affairs Section of the Traffic Department of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau at around 11:00 AM on the 25th of this month. The reason for his arrest was suspected of being a reactionary. It is said that He Zhusan's original name was Jiru, and he was from Linyi, Shandong. During the 15th year of the Republic of China [1926], he served under Zhang Zongchang, specializing in investigating the activities of the Min Party. In the 16th year, the Central Government secretly sent Zhang Weicun (currently the director of the Shandong Provincial Party Rectification Committee and Training Department) to Lu to work secretly. Zhang led comrades to establish a hospital on Zhengjie Street in Xuzhou as a secret agency of the Kuomintang. Later, the Central Government sent Chuan Siyi, a graduate of the third class of the Whampoa Military Academy, to work on propaganda, living in the hospital established by Zhang. He Zhusan and Zhang Chuan were both from the same hometown and often associated with each other, so He learned about Zhang's secret work and secretly reported it to Zhang Zongchang, who ordered a strict search of the hospital established by Zhang. Fortunately, Zhang Weicun was out at the time and was spared from disaster, but Fu Siyi and Zhang's wife and more than ten members of the propaganda team were arrested and suffered a brutal death. Recently, the Second Propaganda Team of the General Headquarters came to Qingdao to work and learned of this matter. After returning to Jinan, they immediately petitioned the Central Government to order the Shandong Provincial Party Department to arrest He Zhusan and bring him to justice. After being approved by the Central Government, the Shandong Provincial Party Department was ordered to handle it. After receiving the order, the Provincial Party Department sent a letter to the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee, requesting that He be escorted to Jinan for transfer to Beijing. The Jiaoji Railway Bureau immediately replied to the Provincial Party Department, requesting that they directly consult with the administrative or judicial authorities for execution. The Provincial Party Department then secretly telegraphed the Qingdao Municipal Party Affairs Steering Committee to handle the matter on its behalf. The Municipal Steering Committee consulted with the Railway Party Department on a solution and sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that it send personnel to arrest He. On the 25th, the Public Security Bureau sent two officers in a car to the General Affairs Office of the Railway Bureau to make contact and take He back to the bureau for detention. In the future, this case may need to be transferred to Jinan for handling. (September 27th)</p>
<h3>Rigorous Defense Against Korean Communists in Jilin Province</h3>
<p>Admonishing Koreans Not to Cause Trouble in Chinese Territory</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: Last month, Korean communist disturbances along the Jidun Railway line in Jilin were quite rampant. Similar incidents have also been frequently discovered in other locations. All captured offenders have been executed by the authorities, and the rest have been dispersed. Recent reports indicate that these communist bandits appear to have fled south to Panshi and Huadian counties. A few days ago, leaflets were discovered near the Yantongshan station on the Ji-Hai Railway. The military and provincial authorities immediately telegraphed orders to the military and civilian officials in the area to strengthen security along the railway line to prevent incidents. Both authorities have also established an anti-communist office to specifically handle anti-communist matters. However, as most of the bandits are Korean, and the province has nearly ten thousand Koreans, managing them is already difficult under normal circumstances. With the rampant communist bandits, suppression becomes even more challenging. Furthermore, the Japanese often overstep their bounds. If not addressed fundamentally, the potential hidden dangers are unimaginable. Therefore, the provincial government has ordered the Civil Affairs Department to draft twenty-two articles for investigating Korean household registrations, submitting them to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for approval, and ordering all counties and bureaus to thoroughly investigate and report to have grounds for investigation in case of accidents. Simultaneously, both authorities jointly issued a public notice prohibiting red infiltration and wrote an article advising all Korean nationals, stateless individuals, and residents not to propagate communism in China. The article is written in both Chinese and Korean to attract the attention of the Korean people. The following is the text of the advisory to the Korean people: (There is now a kind of evil doctrine similar to pestilence, which spreads the fastest and causes death the fastest. What is it? It is communism. This doctrine is a barbaric egalitarianism. Simply put, it means that those who have no food will eat from those who have food. If anyone tries to implement this doctrine, they will first create two opposing enemies: the people who want to protect their bowls of rice and the government that wants to maintain order. This doctrine is absolutely impossible to implement. Now, some Koreans have been infected by this doctrine and have come to China to implement communism, provoking the Chinese people to unite and resist you, and provoking the Chinese government to resolutely suppress you. You are trying to seize other people's rice bowls to solve your livelihood problems, but before you can get your hands on the rice bowls, you will lose your lives. Isn't this too uneconomical? Moreover, you Koreans and we Chinese were originally one family. Since the Shang and Zhou dynasties, when Jizi was enfeoffed in Joseon, this is a historically verifiable fact. Since you separated from China and became independent, you have become estranged from China. After you merged with Japan, you have become even more estranged from China. However, the Chinese government and the Chinese people still remember the history that we were originally one family and have never treated you unfairly. First, let's talk about the Koreans who have naturalized as Chinese citizens. You have no Korean-organized country, so you naturalize in a Chinese-organized country. Once you have become Chinese citizens, you are Chinese people. The Chinese government allows you to naturalize, which is always a good intention. One is to pity your situation and make you people with a country. The other is to give you protection and hope that you will be very good people. Therefore, the Chinese government has always treated Korean citizens who have naturalized the same as Chinese people, without any discrimination. You should also have some conscience, live peacefully and quietly, so that the Chinese government likes you, and the Chinese people love you. That is the right way. Next, let's talk about the Korean residents in China. After the merger of Japan and Korea, even if you were Koreans in the past, now you are considered Japanese. However, Japan is a civilized country in the world. Since you have become citizens of a civilized country, when you come to reside in our Chinese territory, you should have some civilized behavior and add some glory to Japan. Moreover, China and Japan are the most friendly. Therefore, the Chinese government and the Chinese people treat you Korean residents very friendly. If you do things that disturb the peace in China, I am afraid it will hinder the friendship between China and Japan and their people. If the governments and people of China and Japan unite to treat you, then Japan will not recognize you as citizens, and China will not recognize you as friends, and you will suffer. As for the stateless Koreans, they are refugees who sneak into the undeveloped areas of China to reclaim land and live. There are quite a few of these people in the northeastern border of China. According to international law, stateless people are neither protected by international law nor protected by domestic law and should be expelled from the country. If we allow you to stay, it is an act of virtue by the Chinese government. The ancients said that repaying virtue with virtue is the right principle. If you secretly live in other people's territory, secretly reclaim other people's wasteland, secretly enjoy the treatment of other people's citizens, and then arbitrarily cause trouble and harm people, then you will provoke other people to treat you with harsh means. Therefore, Koreans in Chinese territory should not be superstitious about any doctrine or act arbitrarily. As for communism, Koreans cannot implement it in China. If the property of the Chinese people is to be divided equally, each of the 400 million Chinese people can get a share. Koreans are afraid they will not get a share. Even if the idea of ​​fraternity is the basis of communism, the Chinese people are willing to teach foreigners to share their property equally, so that they are no longer poor. But to say that the property of the Chinese people should be divided among foreigners, I am afraid it will be a bit impossible. Please think carefully about it, Koreans. A doctrine must have a purpose to be a good doctrine. If the purpose of Koreans embracing communism in China is to alleviate poverty, it cannot be achieved, then this doctrine should be discarded. Moreover, when this doctrine is implemented, it is necessary to shed blood and fight desperately. After shedding blood and fighting desperately to implement this doctrine that cannot achieve its purpose, this person is either a fool or a madman. If he is a fool, he is an ignorant and foolish person. The Chinese government cannot bear to kill foolish people without teaching them, so we earnestly advise you. If you understand that communism has hundreds of harms and no benefits, quickly repent and live well with the good Koreans. If you do not repent and arbitrarily cause trouble, not only will the Chinese government not tolerate you, but the Chinese people will also unite and treat you like poisonous scorpions and beasts and thoroughly deal with you. Koreans, do not be delusional! Wake up quickly! If you are infected with this evil doctrine of pestilence, there will be no way out!) (September 23)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Boat on the West Mountain Route Intercepted: A boat owned by Jin Denan, traveling from Xishan to Huzhou, was intercepted by a bandit boat with more than ten bandits at Miaoshang Lianshan around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. Approximately eight passengers, including Ding Hongsheng, Deng Huihu, Shi A'san, and boat people A'jinniang, Wang A'jin, and Zheng Zhangcai, were robbed, with losses estimated at over 500 yuan. Bandits also robbed Lü Yipei's pig boat. On the 30th, it was transporting sixty-six pigs from Yongmao Pig Company in Jiaxing to Suzhou and was robbed of more than one hundred yuan in foreign currency near Huguan Huanghua Jing. Yesterday (the 1st), the boatman Chang Bajin, transporting pigs from Lücheng, Changzhou, was also robbed when passing through the area. The bandits also burned Chang's body with ropes.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire at the Border of Yu and Cheng: It has recently been reported that bandits have been entrenched in Shizhuang, at the border of Changshu and Jiangyin, and cases of robbery and extortion have occurred repeatedly. The police went to suppress them the day before yesterday, but the bandits were numerous and well-equipped, and they opened fire in resistance. The two sides exchanged fire for an hour. As a result, both sides suffered casualties. The police, outnumbered, went to various places for help. It is now reported that after receiving the report, the Jiangyin Fortress Command sent a battalion of soldiers to suppress them and notified the counties of Changshu and Wuxi to send troops to jointly suppress them to eliminate their traces.</p>
<p>Report on the Investigation of Aiyu Estuary: The Meili District Office, in order to prevent the emergence of bandits, specifically requested the County Government to block Aiyu Estuary. The County Government ordered the Director of the Construction Bureau to conduct an inspection before further discussion. It is now reported that Chen Qiwei, Director of the Construction Bureau, went to the province due to business, and Section Clerk Yao Zhenlong, accompanied by Jin Yiqun of the First District Office and Jin Wenqiu of the Sixth District Office, hired a boat to investigate on the morning of the 29th of last month and returned to the city on the afternoon of the 30th. According to the investigator, the Aiyu Estuary is more than one hundred meters wide, and no one lives within three miles on either side. The nearest markets are in Guli Village or Dongtang City. There are a total of five tributary rivers north to Hupu, Xuliujing, and Gaopu Estuary, and the newly opened river in the south directly reaches Yangcheng Lake. In short, Aiyu Estuary is a necessary passage from the sea to the lake and from the lake to the sea and definitely needs to be blocked. However, there is no proper way to block it. If wooden fences are used to block it, the villagers will definitely rise up in opposition because ships have to go around a long distance. Also, if people are used to guard it, who knows if the bandits cannot use weapons to force them to open it or destroy it? If earthen dams are built, the project would be huge and the funds would be lacking, making it difficult to achieve results. According to the investigators, it would be best to block each tributary river, then station fifty or sixty land police in the north, and deploy several water patrol boats, so that the head and tail can cooperate with each other. The Construction Bureau has submitted the investigation results to the County Government for review.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Prisoners Attempting to Escape Sentenced to Additional Imprisonment: Zhu Jinsheng, Zhang A'yi, Shen Yunqing, and Cai Heyuan, four prisoners in the First and Second Cells of the Wuxi County Prison, used small knives and clock knives at 12:00 AM on the night of the 20th of last month to secretly dig a tunnel under the wooden bunk in the Second Cell, intending to escape. Chen Shenggu and other prisoners in the same cell reported to the prison guard, who reported to Chief Guard Wang Weizheng. Chief Wang reported to Prison Official Xia, who surrounded each prisoner one by one. Afterwards, County Magistrate Pan interrogated the four prisoners and confirmed the facts, adding shackles for confinement. Except for Zhu Jinsheng, who had committed a crime in Changzhou and had been sent for by the Changzhou County Government the day before yesterday to be escorted back for trial, Zhou, the hearing officer, questioned Zhang A'yi, Shen Yunqing, Cai Heyuan, and the other four prisoners in court yesterday afternoon. Zhu and the other four prisoners were sentenced in court to one year of imprisonment each for their attempt to escape. After the sentences were pronounced, they were returned to prison. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce's Views on the Implementation of Business Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to convene representatives of chambers of commerce from various counties on October 1 to discuss the implementation of business tax. After receiving the order, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce immediately sought the opinions of various industries on the matter. The meeting was held yesterday, and in addition to recommending Cheng Jingtang, the Standing Committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, to attend the meeting in the province, it also cited the speech made by Finance Director Chen when he came to Wuxi to deliver a speech at the Seventh Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society held in Wuxi, saying that the Suzhou Provincial Tax Bureau had organized a preparatory committee attached to the Finance Department with nine members, held three meetings, and had specific measures. It was originally scheduled to implement the tax on October 1. Unfortunately, the war in the north broke out again this year, and the issue of tax reduction was once again thwarted. In terms of the situation, it may not be possible to implement it as scheduled. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance convened a tax reduction committee meeting in 1928, and the most important premise for the general outline of the measures for collecting business tax in various provinces was: (1) Article 8 of Kangwen, the collection of business tax must be carried out after the implementation of tax reduction; (2) Article 7 of the original text, after the implementation of business tax, all existing tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, etc., in various provinces, as well as other taxes similar to business tax, shall be separately merged or abolished. Based on the above points, before the implementation of tax reduction, local governments resumed classifying and adding special tax bureaus, and the tax collection methods have not been improved. If business tax is implemented again, it will be difficult for merchants to bear. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed representatives of chambers of commerce in various counties, requesting them to immediately report to the authorities that business tax should be implemented after the implementation of tax reduction in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and relieve the people's strength.</p>
<p>A Robbery Attempted Near Furong Mountain: More than twenty bandits with torches and weapons suddenly came to the Yu family in Qianjia Lane on the south side of Furong Mountain in Tianxia City in the middle of the night the day before yesterday. They smashed open the gate with stones and were about to enter the house to search for valuables when the owner held a gun and screamed for help. Hearing the sound, the neighbors also fired their guns in response. The bandits were shocked and fled in a hurry.</p>
<p>Preparing to Establish a Military Training Class: Chen Buyun, commander of the First Garrison Regiment stationed in Wuxi, came to Wuxi from Beijing a few days ago to inspect the local defense. In order to train troops and select military talents, he specifically negotiated with Jin Deyi, the regiment adjutant, to prepare to establish a military training class. Eight corporals from each company will be selected for intensive training. In the future, they will be promoted to the position of squad leader. The training location has been decided to be in the Huishan Ancestral Hall, and Chen Chaolin, the camp adjutant of the Third Battalion, has been appointed as the director to actively handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Banditry in the Western Town Has Been Suppressed: The bandit disaster in the western town has been quelled after the police team and the Fortress Special Service Company went to the countryside the night before last to suppress them. The bandits in Qianzhou Huangcun have retreated, and the missing bugler Lai Desheng and Cao Jitang of the Ligang Group and the Public Security Section have also returned home one after another. Only one farmer in Huangcun Street died, and several policemen were injured. The troops are still searching the countryside and will not be difficult to pacify.</p>
<p>More Wounded Soldiers Continue to Arrive for Rest: Director Wu of the 25th Rear Hospital received a telegram from the Military Medical Department of the General Headquarters the day before yesterday stating that more than 400 wounded soldiers were coming to Cheng for recuperation. Director Wu notified the Public Security Bureau yesterday (30th) to prepare everything. The telegraphs were active all night, and the wounded soldiers came from the Yangtze River and were expected to arrive at the port on the morning of the 1st.</p>
<p>Difficulty Borrowing Due to Barren Land and Poor People: Finance Bureau Director Shen Lunxu received a telegram from the Provincial Education Fund Management Office the day before yesterday requesting a loan of 40,000 yuan. Yesterday, Director Shen telegraphed, pleading for exemption from the loan because Jiangyin was suffering from banditry, barren land, and poor people.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Counties Come to the Province for a Meeting: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously intended to implement business tax to compensate for the loss of tax reduction and specifically scheduled September 1 to convene representatives of chambers of commerce from various counties throughout the province to come to the province for a meeting to discuss implementation measures. Later, it was considered that the time was too urgent, so the date was changed to October 1 and telegraphed to the county governments to order the chambers of commerce in various counties to recommend representatives to report to the province in advance. As of last night, 38 chambers of commerce from various counties had arrived with a total of 44 representatives. They gathered at the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce to hold a discussion meeting to exchange views. Most of them advocated implementing the business tax after tax reduction in accordance with the general outline of the tax reduction meeting of five provinces. Change of County Police Captain: Ma Qingfeng, the police captain of Zhenjiang County, was replaced by Fang Ruzhou due to ineffective bandit suppression and was appointed to take over. Fang was ordered to report to the police. However, after receiving the order, Fang believed that the police team in Zhen County was too corrupt and the ammunition was insufficient. At a time when bandits were rampant, he was unwilling to take responsibility for this, so he specifically submitted a resignation to avoid making mistakes. After Hu, the director, received the report, he ordered approval because his resignation was firm and appointed Peng Jian to take over. It is said that Peng, after accepting the appointment, planned to go to work within days.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>General Situation of Educational Funding Difficulties: The difficulty of educational funding in Jiangdu has been going on for more than a day, so that the director has spent his entire time on fundraising and borrowing, with little time to study other things. The difficult situation can already be seen. The educational funding for this year has only been issued until today, which is May of the Gregorian calendar, causing teachers and staff to complain endlessly. The Autumn Festival is approaching, and educational colleagues require that they must be paid for two months to overcome this difficulty. The Education Bureau, in addition to the treasurer promising to pay 10,000 yuan, has no other solutions. According to the number, even if one month is paid, it is still less than 8,800 yuan. As for borrowing, banks and money shops are unwilling to ask about it again due to past credit relations. Therefore, Director Chen of the Education Bureau has been extremely busy these days in this matter. It is not certain whether the teachers and staff who are eagerly looking forward to it will be able to receive one month's payment before the festival.</p>
<p>Election of Directors of the Boy Scouts: At 3:00 PM on the 29th, the County Boy Scout Council held an election meeting at the Party Headquarters. As a result of the election, Du Gongtang, Ye Yangyuan, and Xia Changdi were elected as directors, and Wang Cheng, Wu Dapeng, and Kong Qingsheng were elected as alternate directors.</p>
<p>The Branch Customs Punishes Unmanifested Foreign Goods: The Shenji Wheel Company's Rongfa small tugboat Tonggui, which departed from Zhen and drove on the Zhenqing route, arrived at the Tianfei Palace Bay in the lack of port area of Yangzhou in the evening. After loading the goods, it was docked at the Dongguan passenger loading and unloading area. The customs officers and servants of the Yangzhou and Guan Branch boarded the ship to inspect the goods and found more than 10,000 yuan worth of foreign goods without manifests, which were confiscated. It is said that after mediation, a fine of 4,000 yuan was imposed to settle the matter.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Mutiny of the Bandits in the New Port Town Was Not Successful: At 10:00 PM on the 29th, thirty to forty bandits suddenly arrived in the Xin Gang Town of Langshan West, carrying weapons. They first went to the sentry post of the Public Security Bureau to rob weapons and ammunition, and set fire to the houses in the South City. The merchants rang gongs to alert the police team stationed in Langshan and the Special Industrial Police Team to rush to the scene. The bandits fled and four people were arrested on the spot, along with their weapons, and sent to the County Government. The town did not open for business on the 30th. Self-Help to Relieve the Tidal Disaster: The areas along the river in Tongyi suffered a severe tidal disaster. The County Government reported to the province for relief, but the province ordered that the provincial treasury was currently empty and it was difficult to find a solution. The local government was still required to raise funds for relief.</p>
<p>The Banditry in Yancheng and Funing Has Become Rampant Again: Ma Yuren's troops in Yancheng and Funing areas in northern Jiangsu colluded with local bandits to cause disturbances. The 133rd Brigade went to suppress them, and Ma retreated to Xidang. Recently, a long-distance telephone call from northern Jiangsu stated that 800 to 900 sea bandits of Shen Guanxi's troops had landed in the area, joined forces with Ma, dug trenches and set up cannons in Shanggang and other places, and led the bandits to collect cotton from various salt reclamation companies and harass the situation, which was becoming increasingly unbearable. Li Mingyang went to Hai'an from Rugao on the 30th to concentrate the provincial security regiment's infantry, cavalry, artillery, machine gun detachments, and other teams to suppress them. Although the bandits in Tongtai Jiangbei have been quelled, there are still many ambushes. Li Changjiang, the temporary commander of bandit suppression in the eight counties, telegraphed the county magistrates, saying that the bandits in the counties of northern Jiangsu were rampant and the people were suffering, which was heartbreaking. Previously, the green gauze tents were raised, and the bandits were hiding, hindering the advancement of the suppression. Now, the sorghum has been cut everywhere, and the green gauze tents have passed, so there is nowhere to hide. At this time, the weather is mild, which is a good time to search for and eliminate the remnants of the bandits and annihilate the bandits. It is now limited to two weeks, and the police team, public security bureau, and security regiment of each county must all cheer up and work hard to search and eliminate the bandits, so as to clear the area as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Newly Built Great Compassion Buddha Seven Retreat: The Nanjing Buddhist Lay Buddhist Forest has been established for several months and has built several retreats to superimpose the dead and wounded soldiers from the North and the South to pray for world peace. Now Layman Wang Yiting has initiated the construction of a Great Compassion Buddha Seven Retreat in the forest and invited the abbot of the Shanghai Hai Chao Temple, the old Master Ci Fa, to preside over the seven from September 30. At that time, many permanent residents, good men, and believers in Buddhism will go to burn incense and pray, respectfully recite the Buddha's name, and the Bodhisattva's holy name, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Having Eaten Fish and Meat, They Kidnapped His Son: Baique Village, located in the northwest township about nine miles from the city, is located in the mountains and fields, with stone mines and forests. The villagers are mixed, and there are good and bad. In the Dajingwei area of the village, there is Zhang Youxue, a farmer from Henan, who started his career with diligence and thrift and has a little property. On the 25th of this month, Youxue went to the western township to visit relatives, and his eldest son, Lanfu, had not returned to the city. At about 3:00 PM that afternoon, two bandits with Shandong accents and wooden-cased guns suddenly came to his home. Zhang's wife entertained them with tea and cigarettes and provided dinner with fish, meat, and liquor. The bandits were still not satisfied and forced her to kill a chicken. Zhang's wife did not dare to refuse and slaughtered a hen for them. Unexpectedly, after the bandits finished eating, they took out their wooden-cased guns and threatened her not to make a sound. They took away his second son, Changfu, who was seventeen years old. The bandits told Zhang's wife to contact them at a certain place the next day. However, because Youxue had not returned home the next day, she did not contact the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits mistakenly thought that the Zhang family intended to ignore them, so at about 6:00 PM on the 26th, they gathered more than twenty people, each carrying guns and weapons, and arrived. Seeing this, the eldest son, Lanfu, fled immediately, but Zhang's wife still prepared dinner. After the bandits finished eating, they asked Zhang's wife for 1,800 yuan in foreign currency. Zhang's wife replied that her husband was not at home and the woman had no power. The bandits instructed her to pay the money at Chenwan, Changxing at noon on the 27th, otherwise there would be unfavorable consequences.</p>

<h3>Fan De-Wen Lectures at Jiaotong University Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Three Principles of the People and Socialism</p>
<p>Only Slightly Different in Implementation</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Fan De-Wen, the former Prime Minister of Belgium and leader of the Second International, were warmly welcomed upon their arrival in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, Mr. Fan gave a public lecture at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui. Attendees included Cai Yuanpei and hundreds of the university's students and faculty. The topic of the lecture was the Three Principles of the People and Socialism. President Li Zhaohuan delivered an introductory speech. The meeting adjourned around seven o'clock. The text of Mr. Fan's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Zhaohuan's Introductory Remarks: Li Zhaohuan, the President of Jiaotong University, began with an introduction, stating, "It is an exceptional honor to have the world-renowned Mr. Fan De-Wen here today to deliver a lecture. The relationship between China and Belgium has always been extremely friendly. Regarding the Railway Department directly under our university, the engineering work for the Longhai Railway was entirely undertaken by Belgian engineers. Recently, the Belgian government returned the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity for educational and construction purposes. Furthermore, Mr. Fan is dedicated to promoting world peace, and the Chinese nation is known for its love of peace. With shared ideals and common goals, his presence at our university today is truly an honor in the history of our school."</p>
<p>Thoughts on Visiting the Western Hills: Then Mr. Fan De-Wen stood up and delivered a speech in French, translated by Yang Gongda. He stated, "My visit to China is purely for the purpose of observation and learning. I am definitely not here as a politician to promote any ideology. After arriving in Shanghai, friends have often asked me to discuss various issues, such as my impressions of Soviet Russia, my observations on the Three Principles of the People, and the differences between the Second and Third Internationals. I would like to take this opportunity to humbly offer my personal observations and the perspective of a European to discuss the Three Principles of the People and European Socialism with you. In 1906, Mr. Sun Yat-sen came to Brussels and visited me at the Parliament. I was in a meeting giving a speech, so I had a long conversation with my friends, and at the same time, the Tongmenghui was established in Brussels. This is my direct and indirect relationship with Mr. Sun. During my recent visit to Beijing, I went to the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills. Observing the visitors, I noticed a kind of reverence. It shows that the value of a great man is even greater after his death than during his lifetime. At that time, the efforts of the Kuomintang were not yet widespread, but today, the Three Principles of the People are known to every household."</p>
<p>Discussion of Ideologies: Next, I will discuss the Three Principles of the People from my personal observations. First, regarding Mr. Sun's Principle of Nationalism, there are fundamentally two views in Europe: (1) Aggressive nationalism, which is the use of force to conquer smaller nations. This is absolutely opposed by internationalism and socialism. (2) National self-determination, which is the demand for freedom, independence, and equality by the nation itself. Mr. Sun's Principle of Nationalism belongs to (2). I extremely sympathize with and support it, and I hope it can be realized soon. I especially hope to unite the world's smaller nations to work towards the construction of world justice and truth. Next is the Principle of Democracy. Mr. Sun's principle is based on American President Lincoln's government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Many Europeans believe that China's current level of public intelligence makes it difficult to directly discuss democracy. But I believe this is a necessary process. Therefore, Mr. Sun also said that there should be a transition period from autocracy to democracy, which is the so-called period of political tutelage. During the period of political tutelage, the Nationalist Party guides the gradual development forward, so it is definitely not a regression. I also strongly agree. Next, regarding the Principle of People's Livelihood, in Europe, it is translated as socialism, because the main outline of the Principle of People's Livelihood is similar to socialism in every aspect. The only difference is in the method of implementation. In Europe, because industry is developed and large capitalists are extremely oppressive, socialism advocates that the proletariat unites and strives to achieve its ultimate goal. But Mr. Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood is based on the fact that China is an agricultural country, so it advocates cooperation between labor and capital to resolve disputes. However, due to different environments, the fundamental ideas are no different. Both sides do not argue about this, which I strongly support. Then he spoke about the work of the Second International, saying that the ultimate goal is to seek national equality, freedom, and fraternity."</p>
<p>Slight Change in Itinerary: Mr. Fan was originally scheduled to go to Beijing on the 7th and Hangzhou on the 14th. Now it has been changed to taking the night train to Beijing on the 7th, returning to Shanghai on the night train on the 10th, and going to Hangzhou on the 12th, and returning to Shanghai on the 15th. The Academia Sinica has informed both Beijing and Hangzhou. In addition, the Shanghai World Academy and the Sino-French University have scheduled a tea party to welcome Mr. Fan at 5:00 PM today (the 2nd). It is reported that those invited include Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, Wang Jingqi, Zheng Yuxiu, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and over a hundred others. There will also be a performance of national music by the Datong Music Society.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance's Opinion on Tax Policy</h3>
<p>To be Published Immediately</p>
<p>Statement by Finance Minister Song Ziwen regarding the publication of the Ministry of Finance's Kemmerer Commission's Opinion on Tax Policy: The draft of the Kemmerer Commission of the Ministry of Finance's proposal for China to gradually adopt the gold standard was published in early March of this year. At that time, we intended to publish the commission's other opinions at the same time, but due to the unrest in the current situation, there has been an unexpected delay. It has now been decided to continue publishing the commission's various opinions. In addition to the commission's Opinion on Tax Policy, which will be published immediately, other reports will be disclosed successively in the future.</p>
<h3>September's Boxer Indemnity Already Allocated</h3>

<h3>Fang Benren to Return South Soon</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng's Departure from Shenyang Awaits</p>
<p>Hu Ruoyu Scheduled to Return to Qingdao on the 5th</p>
<p>Central Committee member Li Shizeng received a telegram from Shenyang the day before yesterday stating that Fang Benren, Chairman Chiang's representative in Shenyang, has been granted leave by Chairman Chiang to return south to handle personal matters and is expected to depart soon. As for Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng, they must wait until Commander Zhang Xueliang takes office as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force before leaving Shenyang. Wu Tiecheng will also be traveling to Peiping and Tianjin.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu, after traveling to Shanghai, has been staying at the World Academy on Rue Ferguson. He has been very busy with receptions these past few days and is scheduled to return to his post in Qingdao by ship on the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts Record</h3>

<p>Song Ziwen took the express train out of Beijing at 12:30 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 9:30 PM that evening.</p>
<h3>Four Organizations Host Banquet for American Professor</h3>
<p>To Discuss the International New Calendar System</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson, the former professor of the University of Michigan and the American representative to the 19th International Statistical Conference held in Tokyo recently, and Mr. Coussmuss, the representative of the League of Nations, and Mr. Loomis, the Executive Director of the Pacific Council, have come to China one after another, making a brief stop in Shanghai. The China Critic Weekly, the Chinese Economic Society, the Chinese Statistical Society, and the University of Michigan Alumni Association will host a banquet for the three gentlemen at the Datong Restaurant on Nanjing Road this evening (the 2nd), and have also invited Mr. Lei Mai, professor of economics at the University of Michigan, who came to Shanghai recently, to make academic connections. It is expected to be a grand occasion. Mr. Coussmuss advocates for the International New Calendar System, which divides the year into thirteen months, each with twenty-eight days (four weeks), totaling three hundred and sixty-four days. The twenty-ninth day of the thirteenth month is a public holiday (i.e., New Year's Day), which is more convenient than the twelve-month calendar system. His visit to China is to discuss the issue of dispatching representatives to the International Calendar Reform Conference next year. A small Chinese explanatory booklet has been printed for distribution to various sectors for public discussion.</p>
<h3>Record of the Second Day of the National Anti-Drug Week</h3>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Today is Anti-Drug Law Abiding Day</p>
<p>The 7th National Anti-Drug Movement Week opened yesterday, and all parts of the country responded uniformly. Various circles actively participated in yesterday's opening ceremony. Many telegrams of congratulations were sent from various places, and reports of events held were numerous. Today is the second day of Anti-Drug Week, namely Anti-Drug Law Abiding Day. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony: Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the opening ceremony of the 7th National Anti-Drug Movement Week was held at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. (A) Agenda: (1) Reading the Premier's will; (2) Reading the Premier's anti-drug instructions; (3) Chairman announcing the reasons for the meeting; (4) Reporting on the preparations for Anti-Drug Movement Week; (5) Speeches; (6) Proposals; (7) All taking the anti-drug oath; (8) Closing.

(C) Chairman Wang Jingqi announced the reasons for the meeting, stating that the significance of Anti-Drug Week is to awaken compatriots to rise up against drugs. The drug scourge in our country is becoming increasingly severe, and without a quick remedy, destruction is inevitable. This year's Anti-Drug Week aims to make the people of the country pay attention to the spirit of abiding by the law, understand the importance of implementing anti-drug education, and eliminate domestic opium and restrict the source of foreign opium drugs, which cannot be delayed. (D) Huang Jiaohui, the executive director, reported on the preparations, stating that Anti-Drug Week originated seven years ago. At that time, the people of the country, amidst silence, responded to the call of the association, creating today's great anti-drug movement. There are over four hundred anti-drug groups nationwide. Although there is talk of banning opium, there are still incidents of collecting taxes and extorting donations in various places. The anti-drug movement, although facing difficulties and obstacles, continues to fight as always. The preparations for this year's Anti-Drug Week were more enthusiastic than last year. Events are being held simultaneously in various places today. Our food is scarce, famine is frequent, and the high value of gold and the low value of silver are all caused by the opium drug scourge. After the Anti-Drug Week, it is hoped that compatriots across the country will join together and fight together to achieve the goal of elimination.</p>
<p>Passed Proposals: (1) Requesting the government to abolish the special tax in Hunan and Hubei, resolved (A) that the conference shall formally request the Central Party Headquarters to order the National Government to abolish the special tax in Hunan and Hubei to maintain the ban on opium and preserve the country's reputation; (B) that the conference shall formally write to the Ministry of Finance to abolish the special tax in Hunan and Hubei as soon as possible; (C) that the conference shall formally request the people of Wuhan to jointly urge the implementation.

<p>Measures for Law-Abiding Day: (A) Significance: The anti-opium laws in our country are undeniably strict. If they can be earnestly enforced, eliminating the opium scourge will be easy. However, the government authorities have always been constrained in handling opium cases. When encountering influential people, they often hesitate to act, allowing the state officials to set fires while forbidding the common people to light lamps, so that the law is equivalent to being a dead letter and the ban is no different from a mere formality. Every time I think of this, I feel pain. The implementation of the opium ban relies on the law as a vanguard. The eradication of the drug scourge cannot be achieved without rigorously enforcing the law. (B) Purpose: The purpose of Anti-Drug Law Abiding Day is to awaken compatriots to monitor the government, urge officials to strictly ban opium, use fearless spirit to report illegal officials, merchants, and local traffickers, demand the government to investigate public officials smoking opium and severely punish them according to the law as a warning to others, and then promote the education of legal common sense, so that people have the ability to distinguish right from wrong, know what to take and what to reject, know what to oppose and what to follow, and can each fulfill their civic responsibilities, abide by the law automatically, act as a backing for the law, so that corrupt officials and local bullies have no way to reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, and the eradication of the drug scourge is likely to be achieved. (C) Measures: (1) Widely disseminate anti-opium laws to make the public understand; (2) Petition the local government to earnestly implement anti-opium laws; (3) Collect evidence to report illegal anti-opium officials and merchants and local bullies who privately traffic and plant; (4) Hold a large anti-drug oath.</p>
<p>Outline of Propaganda for Law-Abiding Day: The calamity of opium in China originated from the behavior of imperialists who disregarded international public law and humanitarianism, sacrificing the nations and countries of others to seek their own self-interest. Looking at the introduction of opium, they have deprived our country of countless money and forced us to sign unequal treaties. These people use these unequal treaties to transport opium and drugs into the country to satisfy their desire to poison China, harm others, and benefit themselves. In addition, they publicly sell opium in the areas where overseas Chinese live in the Nanyang Islands, while setting strict laws to protect white people, with those who are addicted being sentenced to ten years in prison. However, this kind of law is ineffective for Chinese people. From this, it can be seen that imperialists, both inside and outside our country, use the law at any time and any place to kill our compatriots and despise our sovereignty. At the same time, they confuse black and white and reverse right and wrong at the League of Nations General Assembly, even saying that our country's opium ban is lax, in order to deceive people. Shouldn't all Chinese people pay attention to this? This is also clear evidence of people despising public law. As for the spread of opium within the country, it is even more clearly contrary to the law. The warlords of various provinces, under the pretext of raising funds, have greatly relaxed the ban, widely collecting taxes, forcing the planting of opium seedlings, and sheltering transportation, and various illegal acts are countless. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition, the National Government has adopted a policy of complete prohibition and ordered the entire country to comply. However, while many have earnestly implemented the policy, there are also quite a few who have set up special agencies to monopolize the opium and collect opium taxes. The bans cannot be consistent, and the people have no target to follow, and the local cases that have occurred repeatedly have not been investigated and punished according to the law. This gives us great suspicion. The Jiang'an local case was ended confusedly, and the large officials transporting opium were not brought to justice. This is what our association does not understand most. Isn't this despising the dignity of the law and destroying the national ban? The ability of opium itself to destroy the law is as described above, and the various evils produced by opium are联带随时随地可发现 We want to eliminate drug scourge today, we should promote the common sense of tobacco prohibition laws, so that the social people have some understanding of the government's prohibition, do not destroy the standards of law, have the ability to identify right and wrong, know where to take and where to reject, can each implement the responsibility of citizens, for the backing of the law. After promoting the education of legal knowledge, we should further promote the people's automatic compliance with the law. Although there are some illegal officials and members of the society with evil forces who despise the law, destroy the tobacco ban, bribery is rampant, and shame is swept away, thus creating an illegal environment. Those who are determined, in view of the deterioration of the situation, mostly hold a negative and pessimistic view. This attitude is not entirely appropriate. We must not be discouraged because of this, but promote the movement of people's automatic compliance with the law in society. Although officials have those who know the law and violate the law, and evil forces are rampant for a while, our pure people have the right to correct them, so that corrupt officials and local bullies are ashamed and have no foothold. From a small number of people to a majority, we can eventually create a great force, so that those who destroy the law and violate the law will move in the right direction. Our country's tobacco prohibition laws are strict and complete. If they can be earnestly implemented to eradicate the tobacco scourge, it will be very easy. However, the government authorities are constrained in handling tobacco cases. When encountering influential people, they often hesitate to act, so that the law is equivalent to being a dead letter, that is, it can only be implemented on ordinary people without power, and there is still no way to interfere with high-ranking officials, wealthy merchants, and what a pity! In the future, the people should bear the responsibility of citizens, implement the monitoring of the government, urge officials to prohibit tobacco in accordance with the law, and must also set an example, and those who violate the law and destroy the law will be abandoned by the people. This move should be especially paid attention to by local people's groups in order to realize the hope of eliminating opium and drugs. All our compatriots should take this as their own responsibility, and the future of the tobacco ban will be successful. Opium is the root of unequal treaties, and unequal treaties have become the talisman of opium. The two evils complement each other, so that our country's affairs are getting worse day by day. Today, foreign opium anesthetic drugs are continuously imported. Our country is restricted by foreign extraterritoriality and cannot crack down on it. Foreign firms and foreigners in various concessions are engaged in public tobacco sales. Our country is also restricted by consular jurisdiction and cannot stop it. The trade of opium is actually dependent on unequal treaties, so unless we find a way to abolish unequal treaties and give our country full sovereignty, our country's opium problem may not be resolved. Otherwise, even if domestic opium is banned, Indian and Persian opium will still be imported in large quantities, and there will be morphine, heroin, cocaine, and other anesthetic drugs produced in various countries to trample on our country's laws and make the harm even worse than before. It is not a blessing for the people, so I hope that comrades who care about the opium problem should pay attention to this point. In short, our country's people's livelihood is poor today, and all kinds of pain are really given by the opium drug scourge. To save the country and save the times, we must strive to restore the movement of tobacco prohibition laws. May the people of the whole country unite during this anti-drug movement week to destroy this opium drug that destroys the law.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Sponsors the Third National Goods Movement</h3>
<p>Letter to Encourage Manufacturers to Actively Participate</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to national goods manufacturers yesterday, stating that the local national goods shopping center said that the local national goods movement conference has been designated as the venue and set up a temporary sales department to facilitate manufacturers to promote their products. At this time, the government is vigorously promoting national goods. All national goods merchants are declaring a united effort to develop together. Moreover, the shopping center is located in the center of the city and is connected to domestic and foreign observations. It is now working hard to improve it in order to establish it permanently and strive for international glory. Previously, your association convened relevant trade associations to discuss methods, which is enough to advocate national goods and seek benefits for merchants. I am grateful. It is a pity that it was not possible to form a meeting due to insufficient numbers. To trace the reason, it may be due to some misunderstanding. I hereby send a letter to ask you to forward a letter to the relevant trade associations of national goods to actively participate during the National Goods Movement Conference. Not only can it be spectacular, but it is also a good opportunity to promote national goods. I hope that national goods merchants will share this idea and cooperate together. Not only is it a blessing for the shopping center, etc. According to this, the promotion of national goods is the most important policy in recent times. The shopping center is also located in the commercial center of the city, and the third National Goods Movement Conference is about to be held. All national goods manufacturers should actively participate and jointly participate in the grand event. It should be handled accordingly.</p>
<h3>Gao Shuo Urges to Inquire About the San De Tang</h3>
<p>Please Reply Immediately to the Jinliyuan Pier Case</p>
<p>The dispute over the Jinliyuan Pier case of the China Merchants Bureau, Gao Shuo, the arbitrator of the bureau, has repeatedly negotiated with the French side. San De Tang has agreed to renew the lease or transfer it and asked the Archbishop of Paris for instructions, but there has been no reply. It has been delayed for three weeks. Gao Shuo sent another letter yesterday, saying that Mr. Lu Bohong and I visited you in the morning of the first day of this month. Regarding the Jinliyuan pier, you immediately agreed to send a telegram to the general hall in Paris to ask for the price, and notify us immediately after receiving a reply. Now it has been more than three weeks. I am very concerned about whether the former reply has returned. Since the new General Office Li of our bureau took office, he urgently wants to get this reply.</p>

<p>To seek an early resolution, I am sending another special letter to inquire, earnestly requesting that you consider our many years of guest-host relationship and reply immediately so that a satisfactory resolution can be reached within a short period. Sincerely, Gao Shuo, Arbitrator of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Lawyer, to Father Xia Lou of the San De Tang.</p>
<h3>Financial Sector Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the designated holiday for the Chinese merchant silver firms and banks according to the new regulations for the Autumn Festival. All payments and receipts due were postponed to the next day. However, foreign banks and firms remained open as usual. The sixth will be the lunar calendar's Autumn Festival, and banks will be closed for one day, while silver firms will be open as usual.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories' Industry Association News Yesterday</h3>
<p>Approximately one hundred factories have ceased operations. The local silk factory industry association is demanding the cancellation of the official weight inspection. If it is not cancelled after the six-month trial period expires on October 1st, a strike will be called. Yesterday was the deadline. One hundred and six silk factories in Shanghai, including Ruilun and Xinchang, must wait until their forward silk contracts with foreign firms are cleared before joining the alliance. The rest have ceased operations since yesterday morning, approximately one hundred factories in total.</p>
<p>The District Division Requests Relief: The fifteen subdivisions of the four districts under the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters report that silk sales in foreign firms are extremely sluggish, the stock of silk is increasing daily, and manufacturers lack capital to operate. Silk factories are announcing shutdowns one after another in both the northern and southern parts of the city, leading to a city-wide shutdown trend. The situation is fraught with danger. If all silk factories shut down, hundreds of thousands of workers will be indirectly and directly unemployed. Once their livelihoods are cut off, they may be lured and led by reactionary elements, which will have a significant impact on social security. Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to provide relief to maintain people's livelihoods. A twenty-second party member congress was convened the day before yesterday to discuss and vote on two proposed solutions: (1) Following the Japanese method, the national bank should accept the silk in stock at a high price as collateral; (2) The government should issue silk industry bonds to provide subsidies. The case has been recorded and submitted to the superior party headquarters for forwarding to the central government, requesting the government to adopt and implement these measures quickly to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Wusong Fortress Commander Inspects Forts</h3>
<p>Deng Zhenquan, the commander of the Wusong Fortress, accompanied by Chief of Staff Teng Jushou and Adjutant Shen Zitian, inspected the Nan Shitou and Bei Shitou forts, Tan Hai lighthouse, and observation post at 8:00 AM yesterday. In the afternoon, they continued to inspect the Shizi Lin fort and the San Guan Tang gunpowder depot. At 4:00 PM, they returned to the headquarters and convened a meeting with Chief of Staff Teng, Adjutant Shen, Ordnance Chief Li, Quartermaster Chief Zeng, Nan Fort Commander Chen Wenyu, Bei Fort Commander Zhou Qing, Shizi Lin Fort Commander Shi Ze, Garrison Battalion Commander Zhang Wenyi, and all officers above the rank of warrant officer for instruction.

<h3>Wusong Garrison Conducts Field Exercises</h3>
<p>The entire Second Battalion of the Twenty-Seventh Regiment of the Fourteenth Brigade of the Fifth Division stationed in Wusong, led by Battalion Commander Xiong Kexi, conducted squad combat shooting exercises at the Haibin of Beimen in Baoshan at 8:00 AM yesterday. The scattered target was made of large yellow cloth, resembling an enemy's position. During the shooting, each squad leader commanded, and the whole squad fired simultaneously and individually. Most were able to hit the target, and the soldiers were energetic and showed courage when advancing. After the exercise, Battalion Commander Xiong gave a critique to the troops and encouraged them to continue to strive for progress. He then ordered them to return to their original defenses.</p>
<h3>Foreign Residents in Zhabei Must Collect Housing Coupons</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate Has Submitted for Discussion</p>
<p>The municipal government is raising short-term customs duty bonds to offset rent. The collection has already begun separately in the northern and southern parts of the city. However, there are many foreign residents in Zhabei, and the matter is the same for everyone, so discrimination is not appropriate. Yesterday, Xu Zhi, director of the Municipal Finance Bureau's North City Additional Revenue Office, sent a letter to the Japanese Consul and others explaining this, asking them to instruct all foreign residents to comply. Japanese Consul Iguchi has already submitted the matter to the Japanese Consulate for discussion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul-General to Hankou Returns by Plane</h3>

He completed his official business yesterday and took a Shanghai-Hankou plane back to Hankou to resume his duties. It is now reported that the confirmed amount of claims for the losses of Japanese nationals in the Changsha incident has been determined and will be formally submitted soon.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi's Invention of Tai Chi Pushing Hands Device</h3>
<p>Won the Highest Award in Belgium</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, is a sports expert in our country. In recent years, he has invented scientific Tai Chi pushing hands equipment such as the Tai Chi ball and Tai Chi stick. He has repeatedly performed publicly in China, which has been deeply praised by sports experts and martial arts masters at home and abroad. They all believe it to be a great tool for exercise. Mr. Chu does not want to keep it secret and intends to offer it to the world, so that mankind's path to health can have another shortcut. Therefore, he took advantage of this trip to Belgium to participate in the International Exposition and brought various Tai Chi pushing hands equipment to display in the Chinese Pavilion, with Mr. Jin Shoufeng performing. Thousands of visitors each day praised it endlessly. The Exposition's Awarding Committee also paid close attention to this type of soft martial arts equipment, and some even personally tried it out, all agreeing that it was beneficial and harmless to the body, so they specially awarded it the highest award to show their appreciation for the craftsman.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Citywide Labor Union's Petition Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The city's entire labor union previously sent five groups of seven representatives to Beijing to petition. As the central government's reply is still pending, they returned to Shanghai yesterday morning to await the response. However, it is reported that the result will be satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchant Ships' Chinese Seamen Demand Pay Raises</h3>
<p>Shipping Companies Have Not Yet Responded</p>
<p>The Labor Union Issues Further Statements</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that the China Seamen's Industrial and Labor Union General Federation submitted demands for pay raises for seamen to Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and other foreign shipping companies. They sent letters to the companies on the 29th of last month, setting a three-day deadline for a response. Yesterday was the last day of the deadline, but the employers have not yet responded. Here are the latest news from both labor and management sides:</p>
<p>Labor's attitude: According to Labor Union Secretary Liu Yuzhou, the pay raise requests only apply to the chief stewards, stokers, and deckhands on the North China, South China, and Yangtze River shipping lines of six companies: Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Nisshin, Osaka, Asiatic Petroleum, and Mobil, totaling approximately 4,000 seamen. Among them, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire employ the most seamen. Therefore, if Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire agree to the proposed pay raise conditions, the other four companies will have no problem. If the employers still ignore them today (i.e., today), they will take the second step: warning each branch of the company. If there is still no result, the seamen from the three foreign shipping lines will go on strike to awaken the employers.</p>
<p>Employer's attitude: Jardine Matheson only translated the Chinese letter into English yesterday after receiving it from the labor union, while Butterfield &amp; Swire translated it the day before yesterday and submitted it to the company managers. They must wait for the companies to hold a meeting before deciding on a response. A response may be sent to the labor union today, and the outcome may be satisfactory.</p>
<p>Ri Ri News Agency reports that Jardine Matheson already understands that the foreign seamen's demands are based on the standards of Chinese ships and are not excessive. Furthermore, Butterfield &amp; Swire seems willing to negotiate. The other companies, such as Nisshin and Osaka, are even less of a problem. Therefore, they have changed their approach and their attitude is gradually becoming more moderate. The union has informed the workers not to be too hasty and to wait for negotiations. The seamen also do not want to go to extremes and have agreed to wait another day. If there is still no satisfactory response by tonight (the 2nd), they will send representatives to issue a final warning. If there is still no result, they will go on strike. The preparations for the strike include: (1) striving for unity between new members (waiters, servants, etc.) and old members (sailors, stokers, chief stewards, cargo handlers, etc.); (2) requesting subsidies from the central government to alleviate the economic hardship during the strike. However, according to the person in charge of the Seamen's Industrial and Labor Union, both sides are expected to get closer after negotiations begin.</p>
<h3>Wusong Rice Industry Labor Dispute Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>Three Agreements Signed</p>
<p>All rice industry workers in Wusong Town, in order to urge the employers to fulfill the conditions stipulated by the labor union, petitioned the Eighth District Party Headquarters to convene a meeting. Because the employers did not send representatives to attend, the workers believed that they were deliberately delaying the matter. All employees left their shops on the day before yesterday (September 30). Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the matter was mediated yesterday by representatives of the Shanghai Rice Industry Labor Union, together with Yin Gongtian and others from the Eighth District Party Headquarters Executive Committee. As a result of the meeting between labor and management, the employers have recognized three terms, and a treaty was signed with the District Party Headquarters as follows: Wusong Rice Industry Labor-Management Agreement: (1) Pay increase: According to the roster, both parties shall agree. (2) The pay increase conditions shall be implemented from September, and the monthly bonus shall be uniformly one yuan. (3) All those who were dismissed or resigned due to this pay raise movement must be reinstated. The pay increase shall be re-negotiated. After the conditions are agreed upon and signed by both parties, all employees immediately returned to work, and a pay raise movement was resolved.</p>
<h3>General Rules and Organization of Labor Union Accounting</h3>
<p>Issued by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Yesterday</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs issued a notice yesterday: Notice for the purpose of announcement. After reviewing the general accounting rules and accounting organization of the labor union in this city, this bureau received instruction No. 7343 from the Municipal Government, which roughly stated: The draft accounting rules and accounting organization of the labor union have been reviewed and revised, and the revised accounting rules and accounting organization are copied and distributed, and should be complied with and promulgated for implementation. Therefore, the revised general accounting rules and accounting organization of the labor union in this city are hereby promulgated for implementation, and all labor unions in this city should be informed accordingly. Sincerely, this notice: (1) General Accounting Rules of the Labor Union in this City; (2) Accounting Organization of the Labor Union in this City.</p>
<h3>Issuing of Police Salaries for September</h3>
<p>The September salaries of the officers and police officers under the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau have been allocated by the Finance Bureau as per the amount. Director Yuan has instructed the captains of each district and team to prepare their領狀 (salary receipts), collect the salaries due to be collected back to the station, and yesterday (i.e., the 1st) sent special commissioners to each district and team to supervise the roll call and issuance.</p>
<h3>Work of the Agricultural Products Inspection Office</h3>
<p>Wheat... Bee colonies... Sugar products</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Office was ordered to inspect wheat in order to eliminate the long-standing practice of mixing cement and impurities. Preparations have been underway for four months. In addition to the implementation already in place in Jiangbei, Shanghai also began work yesterday. It is reported that this preparatory work was carried out under the guidance of Mo Dingsen. Mo graduated from the Montpelier National School of Agriculture in France with a degree in agricultural technology. He is currently a professor of crop science at the Central Agricultural College and a wheat technician. He is indeed a wheat expert. This time, in addition to contacting wheat merchants and flour merchants as much as possible, all the proposed regulations, purchase of instruments, and other work were assisted by Technician Mo. The Ministry of Agriculture originally planned to invite Mo to serve as the director of the second section of the inspection office, but Mo declined because he was already a professor at the Agricultural College and did not want to work in both Beijing and Shanghai. However, he agreed to contribute everything in terms of academics. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture appointed Cai Wuji, the deputy director of the institute, to serve concurrently as the section chief. A wheat inspection office was set up within the section, and Jiang Hanluo was appointed as the director to be in charge full-time. The recent work of the inspection office, in addition to wheat, also involves the import of foreign honeybees. Because each bee is infected with larvae, putrid odor, and island and Nosema diseases, the inspection method has been decided in consultation with the customs. Feng Huanwen, a beekeeping expert, will be responsible for the inspection. Feng graduated from the beekeeping department of the University of Wisconsin in the United States. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce specially sent him to the United States as a commissioner for beekeeping investigation and a director of the beekeeping training class of the Agricultural and Mining Department. He is currently a professor of beekeeping at the Labor University and has extensive experience in inspecting bee diseases. It is also reported that the Shanghai Inspection Office also plans to prepare for the inspection of sugar products due to repeated requests from sugar merchants to determine the quality and avoid being secretly cheated. Zhou Dayaou has been appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture as the preparator. He holds a master's degree in sugar engineering from Lu Province University in the United States and has practiced in three sugar factories in the United States for many years. He was formerly the manufacturing section chief of the refining sugar factory of the National Sugar Manufacturing Company. He is currently also the vice-chairman of the Executive Committee of the International Society of Sugar Cane Technologists. He has been sent to prepare for this and has already arrived at the office.</p>
<h3>Measures to Improve Substandard Wheat After Inspection</h3>
<p>Wheat Sorting Yard Set Up in Fuxin Warehouse, Xiaoshadu</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Office recently submitted a request to implement the inspection of wheat transported to and sold in Shanghai from October 1 due to the problem of mixing wheat with cement and impurities from time to time. The newspapers have repeatedly reported on this. It is now known that according to the regulations for inspecting wheat, wheat that fails the inspection must be ordered to be improved before it can be sold. The procedure for improving the quality is quite complicated. For example, if the moisture content is too high, there must be a large threshing floor for threshing. If there are too many impurities, windlasses, cages, etc. must be used to remove them. Except for some wheat merchants in Shanghai who have the above equipment and can improve it themselves, the rest, such as wheat merchants and vendors, will definitely feel it difficult and unable to sell. In order to actively improve agricultural products, consider the commercial situation, and seek to facilitate merchants in finding ways to improve, the Wheat Sorting Yard has been set up to facilitate the implementation of various improvement procedures. It is reported that it has been agreed with Fuxin Flour Company to borrow the Xiaoshadu Transportation Warehouse of the company as the Wheat Sorting Yard. There is a large open space there, which is very suitable for spreading wheat, and the equipment such as windlasses and cages is complete and can be used. Wang Yaochen, the manager of the company, is very supportive and willing to cooperate with the Agricultural Inspection Office to achieve the goal of improving agricultural products. Yesterday, the office officially informed the Shanghai and Hanshan Grain Guilds to inform all wheat merchants. The wheat merchants and vendors were all grateful to hear this, believing that this move would benefit all parties.</p>
<h3>Yang Zigong Reports on the Tragic Flood in Suizhong</h3>
<p>The China Relief Society has received reports from various parties on the tragic flood in Liaoning. Yang Zigong, chairman of the Charity Association of the Four Provinces of Jilin, Rehe, Heilongjiang, and Fengtian, came to Shanghai and reported that in Suizhong County alone, a total of 62,972 people were affected by the disaster, 750 people died in a few days, 28,660 houses were washed away, and 186,612.9 mu of farmland were destroyed. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. The fields are destroyed and cannot be cultivated, the dead have filled the ravines, and the living are starving to death. Chairman Yang witnessed it with his own eyes and could not bear to speak. The disaster in Suizhong County is like this, and the rest are probably similar. Although the association has telegraphed Tianjin to ask Director She to report on the situation in Suizhong County, where Xikamenwai Avenue was submerged by the flood,</p>
<p>Gui Sheng set up porridge kitchens in Dazhuang and Xiaozhuang, which were the most severely affected by the disaster. In addition to the 10,000 yuan that the association had previously remitted to Suizhong for disaster relief, it remitted another 30,000 yuan from the Shanghai Bank of Communications yesterday for the porridge kitchens to purchase grain. However, the disaster is great and the relief funds are meager. It is impossible to solve the urgent need with a drop in the bucket. The fields are destroyed and cannot be cultivated, and the dead cannot be saved. Without a large sum of money, it will not be enough to relieve the suffering. Chairman Yang brought many photos of the tragic disaster in the county and sent them to the newspapers, hoping that benevolent people at home and abroad would see the tragedy and contribute to saving the catastrophe. Chairman Yang also said that there was a rumor that General Zhu Ziqiao, a great philanthropist in the Northeast, had encountered danger. He and Zhu Zi were returning together from Shaanxi, where they were providing disaster relief. There is no truth to it. It is because others were kidnapped in the places where General Zhu passed by, and passers-by spread the rumor in error. I received a telegram from Liaoning a few days ago that General Zhu will return to Ping from Liaoning soon to carry out disaster relief work.</p>
<h3>Inspection Report of the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Sixty-Seventh Time</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Sixty-Seventh Inspection Report on Issuance Reserves states: In accordance with Article 15 of the Central Bank Regulations, this committee is responsible for inspecting the Central Bank's strict exchange coupon reserve. The sixty-seventh inspection was held at the bank's Issuance Bureau on September 30, 1919, and the results of the inspection are announced as follows: Total amount of exchange coupons issued: 19,460,912 silver dollars, including: 18,490,262 silver dollar coupons, 970,650 yuan in subsidiary coin coupons. Total amount of exchange coupon reserve: 19,460,912 yuan, including: 17,022,512 yuan in cash reserve. The cash reserve is calculated as: 12,664,213.27 yuan stored in the bank's issuance treasury, 1,170,867 yuan stored in branches in various ports, and 3,187,431.73 yuan stored in the same industry. Guarantee reserve converted into 2,438,400 silver dollars. According to Article 2 of the Central Bank's Exchange Coupon Regulations, the cash reserve is 60% and the guarantee reserve is 40%. The results of this inspection show that the cash reserve exceeds 60% and the guarantee reserve is less than 40%, which is in accordance with the regulations. This report is hereby made. September 30, 1919, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Bank, Li Fuxun, Supervisors Wang Jingli, Bei Songsun, Qin Runqing, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiding.</p>
<h3>Four Banks' Issuance Reserve Report</h3>
<p>Thirty-Ninth Time</p>

<h3>Request for Instructions on Handling Shadow Companies</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday: The forwarding, customs declaration industry reports that there are shadow companies using registration and licensing as a means of resistance. What method should be used to provide relief? According to the situation, please submit the matter for review and instruction. On September 26, the Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Declaration Industry Association sent a letter stating that the establishment of the industry association is nothing more than to consolidate the group and protect the industry. However, there is no clear provision on how to resolve the issue of shadow companies' trade names, and there is nothing to defend against. Therefore, a special request for interpretation is made for compliance. If there are members who are not the same as the public, engage in the same business, and have the same trade name, if the shadow company alone directly applies to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration and obtains a ministerial license as a means of resistance, if the company that has joined the association for many years requests the industry association to find a way to provide relief, what laws and regulations should the association rely on, or submit to the Bureau of Social Affairs for processing, or send a letter to your association to forward to the superior official for review, the enemy will have no way to resolve it. If it is not justified, the association will lose its ability to protect its members, and there will be no value in the association. I have always looked up to your association as the competent authority for commercial groups. For the above questions, please give clear instructions for compliance, and I will be deeply grateful. According to this, the organization of the industry association is originally to safeguard the common interests of the industry and correct the abuses of the business. Now, if there is a shadow company that engages in the same business with the same trade name and rises up to negotiate, it uses registration with the ministry as a means of resistance, so that legitimate businesses cannot be corrected. If it is not remedied, it will truly affect the protection of the industry association. It is reasonable to submit the matter to your bureau for inspection, to give approval, instruction, and compliance, which will be deeply appreciated.</p>

<h3>Power Outage in the Central District of the Public Concession Last Night</h3>
<p>Total Darkness for About Half an Hour</p>
<p>The Cause Was Damage to the Transformer Substation</p>
<p>The electricity in the central district of the Public Concession, east of Xizang Road, south of Nanjing Road, west of Fuzhou Road, and north of Avenue Edward VII, suddenly went out at 6:42 PM last night. The streetlights on all the roads were also completely dark. The darkness was comparable to the situation in Zhabei the night before. Light was restored at 7:35 PM. The reason for the blackout was that the electrical transformer substation inside the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road was accidentally damaged, causing a power outage in the central district. The streetlights on the Jing'an Temple Road from the Racecourse to the Carder Road intersection were also completely extinguished.</p>
<h3>Filial Son Attempts Matricide with a Knife</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Old Father Wields a Stick</p>
<p>Mother Barely Escapes Death</p>
<p>Whether Ms. Ma is the Biological Mother</p>
<p>Court Still Needs to Investigate</p>
<p>Hu Aji of the Hongkou Police Station, No. 526, Three-way Crossing, a native of Shaoxing, is over half a century old and has only one son named Fuzhang, now thirty-three years old. He is idle and addicted to smoking and gambling. Having no ability to support himself, he depends entirely on his parents for food and clothing, and is extremely wasteful. Any money he gets is quickly squandered. Aji and his wife, Ms. Ma, have repeatedly admonished him, but his nature is like a beast, treating their teachings like discarded straw sandals. This has left the elderly couple sighing in dismay. Last month, Aji saw his son's clothes were tattered, resembling a beggar from a low-class institution. Moved by paternal instinct, he prepared new clothes for him to wear, hoping to save face. Aji has served in the police station for over thirty years and has many friends, fearing criticism from others. However, Fuzhang did not appreciate his father's concern and repent promptly. He pawned the new clothes and spent the money on opium dens and gambling dens. As a result, within a few days, he was as destitute as ever. His family currently resides at No. 187, Changkang Lane, north of Route Alabaster, Kaifeng Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, Fuzhang, again penniless, returned home from outside, intending to ask for money. He hesitated to enter directly, pacing back and forth in Changkang Lane. Suddenly, Aji returned from his duties at the police station. As soon as he entered the lane, Fuzhang immediately demanded money. Aji, seeing his unfilial son, angrily ignored him. Unable to obtain money and feeling hungry, Fuzhang had no choice but to go to his uncle's house for dinner. He slandered his parents to his uncle and revealed his rebellious intentions. The uncle, fearing that this would truly escalate into a tragic act of unfilial violence, decided to take precautions. He immediately sent his son to inform Aji. Sure enough, after dinner, Fuzhang, carrying a kitchen knife, rushed back to his parents' house, intending to commit matricide. Reaching Changkang Lane, he saw his mother, Ms. Ma, walking out of the house. Fuzhang, who had been hiding in a dark corner, suddenly rushed forward, grabbing and subduing her. In this critical moment, Aji, who had been informed by his nephew, grabbed a door bar and struck Fuzhang's leg with full force. Fuzhang fell to the ground in agony. Aji seized the knife and went outside the lane, calling two Chinese constables, No. 2809 and No. 2667, who took Fuzhang and the knife to the Huishi Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the case was originally intended to be prosecuted under Article 294, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code for attempted assault. However, after investigation, the victims were found to be his biological parents. It should be changed to Article 283, attempted harm to direct ascendants, and prosecuted accordingly. He requested that the law be strictly enforced to maintain ethical principles and uphold social order. Subsequently, the victims, Hu Aji and his wife, recounted the unfilial behavior of their rebellious son and also requested severe punishment. When questioned, Fuzhang surprisingly denied that Ms. Ma was his biological mother, claiming she was his father's concubine, a preposterous and extreme falsehood. He only admitted to having an argument at the lane entrance last night, denying any knowledge of the knife. Because the defendant denied that Ms. Ma was his biological mother, which was a crucial point, the court questioned Hu Aji in detail. Aji clarified that Ms. Ma was indeed his wife and Fuzhang was indeed his biological son, and his brother could testify to this. Judge Wu then ordered the defendant to be detained and scheduled a further hearing in seven days to summon witnesses.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Dies Suddenly at Eighteen - Suspicious?</h3>
<p>Argument with Husband the Night Before</p>
<p>Death Reported the Next Morning</p>
<p>Husband Seems to Be a Suspect</p>
<p>Court Hearing Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Qian Acai, a native of Ningbo, works on a Yangtze River steamer for a certain shipping company. He married Xuan Axiang, who was only eighteen years old. She lived at No. 711, Yangshupu Road. On the 18th of last month, Qian returned to Shanghai with the ship. When he had time to go home, his wife had not yet washed his changed clothes, so the couple had an argument. The next day, Axiang suddenly died. The Huishan Police Station was notified and dispatched detectives to investigate. Finding Qian Acai suspicious, they detained him and sent him to the Special District Court for interrogation. The court opened yesterday morning. The police station charged Qian with murder under Article 282. Then, a witness, Zhang Rengui, was summoned and testified, "The deceased is my niece. Her residence is half a li away from my home. The couple has always been on good terms. At 7 PM on the evening of the tenth, Axiang came to my house and did not mention any argument with her husband. Unexpectedly, I suddenly heard of her death the next afternoon. I believe she was killed by my nephew-in-law, so I reported it to the police station." Zhang Li, a woman who lived in the same house as the deceased, testified that "The defendant and his wife lived downstairs. During dinner on the evening of the 18th, I heard the couple arguing. At 6 AM the next morning, I got up and went downstairs and saw the defendant sleeping near the door and Axiang was sleeping leaning on a table. Afterwards, I went out to buy groceries through the back door. When I returned, Axiang was already dead. But I saw the condition of the body," and so on. When questioned, the defendant confessed, "Because my wife did not wash my changed clothes, we argued on the night of the 18th. I angrily raised my hand and hit her head twice. Shortly after, my wife complained of abdominal pain, so she went to sleep. Then I also went to sleep. At 7 AM the next morning, I woke up and saw that my wife was no longer sleeping on the bed, but leaning on a table outside the room. Because she was in a place where people walk, and I was afraid of obstructing the entrance and exit of other people in the house, I moved the stool she was sitting on. Unexpectedly, my wife immediately fell to the ground without a sound, her eyes slightly open, and she did not respond when I called her. Only her hands were still warm, so I hired a rickshaw to send her to the hospital, but there was no way to save her, and she soon died," and so on. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be detained and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Dismembered Male Corpse on Avenue Dubail</h3>
<p>Entire Body Divided into Six Sections</p>
<p>Can Be Described as Inhumane</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, patrolling constables of the French Concession's Baojian Road Police Station, while patrolling the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue des Grosliers, discovered two pieces of luggage, including a trunk and a bundle. Inside was a male corpse, divided into six sections. The legs and feet were divided into four sections and placed in the leather trunk. The body and head were divided into two sections and hidden in the bundle, completely naked, without a thread, with blood and flesh blurred, unbearable to witness. The constable was shocked and immediately reported to the police chief, who personally arrived at the scene. It was determined that the corpse was a man around twenty years old, who was killed with a knife. Detectives were dispatched to carry the corpse to the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Hall for examination.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Municipal Finance Bureau's Boat Tax Office</h3>
<p>Saving Expenses... Rectifying Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Finance Bureau abolished the boat tax contractors last year and took over the operation, establishing the Municipal Boat Tax Office and the Wusong, Suzhou River, and Chenjiadu branches, as well as the Xiaoshadu, Puzhao River, and Pudong inspection stations, although boat tax revenue has increased, the Boat Tax Office employed many people and had large expenses, which did not significantly benefit the municipal treasury. Now, Finance Bureau Director Tang Naikang, to reduce expenditure and increase income, has submitted a proposal to the municipal government to reform the organization of the Boat Tax Office. The Dongjiadu, Wusong, Suzhou River and other places will all be renamed as the "So-and-So Boat Tax Office." Each office will have a director, two clerks, and tax collectors and inspectors. The number of people will be reduced by one-third compared to before. Each Boat Tax Office will be directly under the Second Section of the Bureau, with two clerks designated to oversee boat tax matters. Two chief inspectors will be established to inspect the collection work of each office and supervise their compliance. It is reported that after the organizational change, the expenses of each Boat Tax Office will be reduced by more than 7,000 yuan per year compared to the original budget. The bureau order has been published yesterday, and the reorganization will be implemented from October 1st.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Works Prohibits Loading and Unloading of Goods in Parking Lots</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works, in order to improve traffic and eliminate danger after the completion of the reconstruction of East Gate Road, had set up parking lots on the northern public land at the eastern end of the road, designating places for parking automobiles and rickshaws, marking boundaries with white paint, and installing signs. However, nearby businesses often used the land to place goods. For example, the Yuantai Hengxing Company set up vegetable stalls in the parking lot a few days ago. After the bureau discovered this, it consulted with the First District of the Public Security Bureau to summon them for a fine. On the 29th of last month, the bureau's inspectors discovered that Jiang Zengmao and Wufeng Hengxing were loading and unloading goods at the site, placing many items such as pears and chestnuts, obstructing vehicle parking. They were ordered to write down statements, allowing them to move the goods, and the bureau sent a letter to the district office to investigate and deal with it, and ordered the station police to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Statistical Issues in Kidnapping Cases</h3>
<p>Social Bureau Replies to Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>One Reason for Discrepancies in Numbers</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau previously received a letter from the Public Security Bureau, asking for a detailed reply regarding the discrepancy between the statistics of kidnapping cases published by the Social Bureau and the figures found by the Public Security Bureau for verification. It is reported that the statistical materials of the Social Bureau are recorded from newspaper reports, and it is feared that there are some cases not reported by newspapers, but there is no other source of information to draw from, so it has to be used as a basis temporarily. In the statistics, the so-called kidnapping cases include those who kidnap people for ransom. If people are kidnapped for ransom after robbery, they are listed separately in the robbery and kidnapping statistics. Although the perpetrators and victims are the same, the nature is different, so to ensure the accuracy of the statistics, this has to be done. This may be one of the reasons why the number of cases in the Bureau is greater than those investigated by the Public Security Bureau. It is now reported that the Bureau has sent a detailed situation of each case and the dates of the newspapers in which they were reported to the Public Security Bureau for reference, and requested to provide this information in the future for mutual verification.</p>
<h3>Vehicle Accident Statistics for September</h3>

The vehicles involved in the accident cases last month included 729 automobiles, 68 public buses, 115 trams, and 109 bicycles. Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road were the places with the most accidents, followed by Broadway Road. Pedestrians must be especially careful when crossing these roads.</p>

<h3>Medical Community Scheduled to Visit Bulido Factory</h3>
<p>Shanghai Jiufu Company has always been committed to promoting the pharmaceutical industry. Over the years, it has manufactured new drugs, such as Bailingji, Shengdan, and Jiufu Emulsified Cod Liver Oil, which have been sold all over the country and have been praised. Moreover, their issuance goals are all aimed at imported goods with economic aggression. A flourishing sales volume can recover infinite rights. Therefore, it has especially gained the sympathy of the medical community and patriotic people. It is now reported that the company has created a new drug, Bulido, which is divided into pure and hybrid types, and is also based on the initial intention of recovering rights. At the beginning of its release, it was praised by the medical community, sympathized by enthusiastic people, and introduced by domestic goods organizations. The company has spent huge capital to purchase various new and sophisticated machines for the successful creation of Bulido, and has repeatedly tested by pharmaceutical chemistry experts before achieving satisfactory results. The products are consistent with imported products. Therefore, its manufacturing method is extremely complex and profound. It is now heard that the company, in order to make the medical community understand the manufacturing process, has scheduled to invite the medical community to visit the Jiufu Company's main factory on Back Road on October 5 (Sunday) to visit the manufacturing of Bulido. On the one hand, please give guidance from the medical community, so that we can gather ideas and benefit more and seek progress. On the other hand, it can make the medical community understand the truth of Bulido's manufacturing, which proves that the progress of our country's pharmaceutical industry can be compared with the products of famous foreign pharmaceutical factories. Invitation letters have been sent out and it is expected to be a grand event at that time.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Orders Arrest of Tan Puda</h3>
<p>Person Involved in the Li Jiyun Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Using Bandits to Seek Wealth and Take Lives</p>
<p>Citizen Li Shaocong submitted a petition to the municipal government a few days ago, claiming that his father, Ji Yun, was intercepted and kidnapped by bandits in Hangzhou on April 11 of this year. Since the case occurred, there has been no further communication from the bandits, intending to extort a large sum of money. At that time, Tan Puda claimed to be enthusiastic and unwilling to stand idly by, and was willing to take responsibility for contacting them. After contacting the bandits five or six times, it was agreed to prepare a sum of 11,000 yuan, which was handed over on the 23rd of that month. However, after a long delay, the hostage was not released. It was not until the first day of last month that more than ten major criminals were captured by the Concession Police Station for the robbery of 100,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Local Bank. Among them, Wang E and Wang Yang confessed to being involved in the Li kidnapping case in Hangzhou, and said that the ransom received was actually 10,000 yuan, and the rest was embezzled by the contact person, so the hostage was not released. Later, Tan Puda even asked people to intercede for him. This kind of social scourge is more guilty than the kidnappers. Therefore, he asked for a speedy arrest and severe punishment to maintain national discipline and warn the treacherous. Afterwards, according to the confession of the kidnappers, the body of Li's father has been recovered under Wangshan Bridge in West Lake, and the examination was correct. Based on this, the municipal government considered that if the allegations are true, they should be strictly investigated and ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Security Corps and the Rectification Committee to strictly arrest Tan Puda, and pursue the case to the end.</p>

<h3>Trial Begins in Case of Automobile Collision Killing Vietnamese Constable</h3>
<p>Judge Will Personally Visit the Scene for Clarification Before Further Hearing</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's automobile No. 1873, driven by the chauffeur Yu Xingui, was driving east on Rue de la Porte de Pierre at the intersection of Route Saussier in the French Concession, while the automobile No. 2377 of Mr. Sun Herong, a member of the municipal government, was driven by the chauffeur Sun Zulin, driving north, also arrived at the intersection. The two cars failed to avoid each other, causing a collision that knocked down and injured the foot bones of a Vietnamese constable No. 398 on duty, leading to his death. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday, the police station brought all the witnesses to the French Court for questioning. First, Chen, the wife of the deceased Vietnamese constable No. 298, complained that her husband had been killed and requested justice, and hired a lawyer to claim compensation. Sun Zulin testified that "the car of the citizen was traveling north at a speed of only fourteen or fifteen yards. It was due to the negligence of Yu Xingui's car that this accident occurred." Yu Xingui testified that "the car of the citizen was turning west, traveling at a speed of only eleven yards. The Vietnamese constable directed me to drive. At that time, Sun's car was far away. I don't know how, but suddenly it arrived at the intersection. It can be seen that it was driving very fast. Sun's car hit the rear of the citizen's car, causing it to rush to the post and crush the Vietnamese constable to death." The Chinese and Western officials instructed that since both parties had their own arguments, they would wait for a field visit for clarification before further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Unintentionally Arrest Two Gang Leaders</h3>
<p>Little Wuxi and Little Quan Gen</p>
<p>Detectives Zhu Ziqing, Huang Fusen, Li Wenzhao, etc. of the Old Gate Police Station went out on patrol late at night the night before and, at the intersection of Tibet Road and Dazha Road, saw two people wearing raincoats approaching, with their hands in their pockets. When Detectives Zhu, and the others were about to check, the two men took out pistols, intending to resist arrest. The detectives bravely and unanimously arrested the two men, seized two pistols with ten bullets, and took them to the Old Gate Police Station. Under interrogation, one confessed to the name Yu Guimao, originally from Wuxi, and the other confessed to the name Zhu He, from Shanghai. The police chief ordered them to be detained. According to investigations by the detectives, Yu's nickname was Little Wuxi, and Zhu's nickname was Little Quan Gen. They were actually the leaders of the major case in which more than 10,000 yuan of property was stolen from a certain pharmacy at No. 1681, Xinzha Road. After the case occurred, four members of the gang were arrested, and they have been interrogated and convicted. However, the arrest warrants for the ringleaders Little Wuxi and Little Quan Gen were issued by the court, but because their whereabouts were unknown, they could not be arrested. The detectives were commended by the police chief for unintentionally arresting the two gang leaders. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court and requested an extension of the interrogation. Because the two thieves were involved in a serious case, it was necessary to conduct a more detailed investigation. Judge Zhou Hanting questioned the two thieves about their age and the circumstances of their arrest and ordered them to be detained for fourteen days for further trial.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Route Cardinal Foch Last Night</h3>

<h3>Public Bus Kills an Elderly Man</h3>
<p>A Route 1 Shanghai South Public Bus was involved in an accident that killed a pedestrian at the Dada No. 3 Wharf in Nanshi a few days ago.

<h3>Cao Ziliang Commits Suicide Due to Poverty</h3>
<p>Takes Poison in the Huizhong Hotel</p>
<p>Cao Ziliang, a native of Changshu, used to work as a bookkeeper in the store attached to the China Public School, now renamed China Primary and Secondary School. Later, due to the wage arrears situation in the school, Cao resigned. He was recommended by Zhu Hejun, the principal of the school, to the Zhaoshangju Tunan Ship, and still worked as an accountant. After the military興, Guonan supplied soldiers and Cao lost his job again. Because his family was not wealthy, it was difficult to be idle, and he could not find a job, so he was very depressed. A few days ago, he met his former servant Cao Yunbo on the road. After talking to each other, he learned that Yunbo had become the deputy manager of the Friendship Knitting Company after leaving school. He told Yunbo that he was staying at Room 88 of the Huizhong Hotel on Sanma Road and invited him to visit him on the 28th. The day before yesterday at noon, Yunbo visited with friends. At that time, the door of Ziliang's room was still closed. After knocking for a long time with no response, the hotel staff felt very strange. Later, they forced the door open and found that Ziliang had taken poison and died in bed. They immediately reported to the Old Gate Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. They found a package of poison and carried the body to the Philion Road morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Special District Court and commissioned Prosecutor Guo to visit the morgue. After examination, Cao Yunbo declared that he was a fellow townsman and former colleague of the deceased. He had no parents above, no wife or children below, and was all alone. This suicide was purely due to his poor circumstances. Out of friendship, he was willing to claim the remains and provide a coffin. Prosecutor Guo then ordered Cao Yunbo to take the body away for burial.</p>

<h3>Lost Unnamed Girl Waiting to be Claimed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday sent a lost unnamed girl from the First District, First Precinct.

<p>Ministry of Education Explains New and Old Organizational Laws for Student Self-Government Associations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education regarding student self-government associations, has inquired whether they should be handled in accordance with the amended organizational plan for people's organizations, or whether those already organized according to the outline of student self-government association organizations can be exempt from reorganization. The Ministry requested a review and interpretation from the Central Executive Committee. The Ministry of Education issued an interpretation stating: "Received and noted. The principles of student organizations and the organizational outline for student self-government associations have both been approved by the 67th Standing Committee of the Central Government and remain in effect. Student self-government associations in various schools that have been organized in accordance with these principles, the outline, and the social organization procedures approved by the 70th Standing Committee of the Central Government, and whose meetings have been approved by the local senior party headquarters and reported to the competent authorities for record, should be recognized as legal and need not be reorganized. However, in the future, any newly organized student self-government associations, in addition to complying with the organizational principles for student organizations and the organizational outline for student self-government associations, should follow the amended organizational plan for people's organizations in their organizational procedures." This is for your information.</p>
<h3>Five Ministries and Agencies to Discuss Foreigners Coming to China to Conduct Scientific Research Today</h3>

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted with the Ministry of Education on three matters for review: (1) Americans York Robson and others going to Xinjiang for scientific research; (2) British nationals Rick Myers and others carrying weapons to Xinjiang to measure and study glaciers and geology; (3) British national Smith and others carrying weapons to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces to study animals. After the Ministry of Education approved the consultations, it invited the relevant agencies, including the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs, and the Academia Sinica, to meet at the Ministry of Education today (the 2nd) to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3>Entire Faculty of the Department of Botany at National Central University Resigns</h3>
<p>| Departmental Affairs and Classes Completely Suspended |</p>
<p>Students Petition the Ministry of Education and the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>More than ten students from the Departments of Zoology and Botany at the National Central University have reported that all professors in the Department of Botany have resigned one after another, and departmental affairs and classes have been completely suspended. Although the school authorities have tried to retain the professors, the professors insist on resigning because the fundamental problems have not been resolved. The students went to the Ministry of Education to petition the previous day (the 29th). Minister Jiang happened to be attending a memorial week at the National Government, and Secretary Zhou met with them on his behalf. He accepted the request and acknowledged that the school's administration was poor and that the professors resigned as a result. The school authorities should be held responsible. He will forward the matter to Minister Jiang and hopes to find a proper solution in the near future. The students then sent representatives to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition, and a certain committee member met with them and promised to provide assistance. The reasons for the professors' resignation are listed below: (1) The research funds from the Cultural Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation to support the department have been arbitrarily misappropriated by the school. (2) The construction of the Biology Building has become a mere formality, is not aesthetically pleasing, and the structure is not solid. The school authorities did not conduct a careful plan in advance, nor did they supervise the construction responsibly. Half of the construction costs of the building were subsidized by the Rockefeller Foundation, which is a matter of national importance, but the school authorities do not consider making amends. (3) There is no formal dean of the College of Science, and it is difficult to handle matters, etc.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the 65th Boy Scout Troop</h3>
<p>The 65th Boy Scout Troop of China, the Commercial Press Workers' Boy Scout Troop in this city, has been in existence for three years since its establishment. Due to the many events of the 6th Workers' Union, there has been much neglect of the Boy Scout side, so there has not been much development. Since the Reorganization Committee of the Union took office in June of this year, it has deeply realized that Boy Scout training is the only way to cultivate young people. Therefore, it entrusted Wang Wenhua, Liu Yucai, Wang Dingchang, Xie Yanbo, etc. to reorganize the troop and absorb as many young members of the publishing house as possible to provide Boy Scout training. Later, the 7th Board of Directors of the Workers' Union was established and also tried its best to support the troop, so the troop's affairs have become more vigorous than before. Since March, in addition to daily morning exercises, curriculum training has been conducted every Wednesday and Saturday evening, and examinations are held every Sunday. The elementary courses have now been completed, and the Special Savings Custody Committee was also established last month and officially implemented group savings. Other groups, such as the rescue team and the signal flag team, have also been trained and are proficient in succession. At present, on the one hand, new members are being registered with the central government, and on the other hand, preparations are being made for the start of the intermediate courses. At the same time, preparations are being made to participate in the National Day Boy Scout Grand Review in this city, so the work is extremely busy.</p>

<p>| Men's Three-Week Competition... Liu and Guo Win |</p>
<p>| Women's Huang and Yan Forfeit... Two Yangs in Final |</p>
<p>The Chinese tennis singles competition was in its third week yesterday. There were originally four groups, but Shen Meizhen did not show up and was considered to have forfeited. Her opponent, Qian Wenbao, won a spot in the quarter-finals without having to play. In the match between Sun Chengbi and Shao Leping, only one set was played. Sun won 6-1. At that time, it was getting late and Shao Leping's eyesight was slightly impaired, so he could not continue the match. The two sides agreed to continue the match this afternoon. The remaining two matches were well-played. Liu Keng and Guo Qida have already secured their spots in the quarter-finals. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Liu Keng 6…3 7…5 6…4 Defeats Yuan Xunan</p>
<p>Guo Qida 6…3 6…3 3…6 6…0 Defeats Qian Yaobin</p>
<p>Also, in the women's competition, only four participants entered. The preliminary round was held yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. Unexpectedly, one person in each group forfeited: Huang Zhifang forfeited to Yang Ren, and Yan Mei forfeited to Yang Bizhen. This lack of sportsmanship is regrettable. The two Yangs have now obtained the right to the final match.</p>

<h3>Chinese Preparatory International Walking Race</h3>

This year, the Association has reappointed Mr. Shi Youhui as honorary director and coach and is scheduled to start official practice next week to prepare for winning the championship again. Those who wish to join in the practice can contact Mr. Shi Youhui.</p>
<p>Also, all the judges of the International Walking Race have been Westerners in the past. The Association questioned the matter with the International Association. The International Association replied with deep apologies and said that they had not appointed Chinese judges because they were unaware of any Chinese who were familiar with the rules of walking races. The International Association has specifically requested the Association to introduce judges in advance for this year's competition. The Association is therefore announcing that anyone who is familiar with the rules of walking races and wishes to serve as a judge should register with the Association's office.</p>
<h3>North China Games</h3>
<p>Changed to be Held in Shenyang</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The North China Games of this year, had previously been declared by Hao Gengsheng, the executive member of the association, that due to various reasons, it could not be held. Following the precedent of previous years, it was announced that the games would be cancelled. However, Commander Zhang Xueliang, considering that the Far East Games had recently ended in failure and the North China Games could not be held immediately afterwards, felt that this would expose the country's weaknesses too much. He specifically instructed Hao to find a way to prepare for the games in Shenyang and promised to bear all expenses within the association. Hao then began preparations again. The following is a letter from Hao to a certain party, disclosed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Commander Zhang summoned me for a conversation, saying that he read in the newspaper that the North China Games would not be held this year, and asked if it was true. I said it was true and reported in detail the progress of negotiations with various parties. The commander then said, "The Far East Games recently ended in failure, and the North China Games cannot be held immediately afterwards, which would expose the country's weaknesses too much. I hope you can find a way to prepare for the games in Shenyang," and asked how much money was needed. I said that the North China Games last year spent too much money, and although the lively scene was unprecedented, it should be regarded as accidental and not set as a precedent. If the games are held in Shenyang this year and prepared according to educational principles, approximately ten thousand yuan would be sufficient. The commander also nodded in agreement. Last night, I conveyed this instruction to Zhang Boqin in Tianjin, and a reply telegram has arrived, which reads: "To Mr. Hao Gengsheng of Northeast University, I agree to hold the North China Games in Shenyang. Qin." This is the general course of events. As for who will be responsible for the preparations and when the games will be held, I have already asked the commander for instructions and a decision should be made within days. (25th)</p>

<h3>Stabilization of Financial Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. The Chinese Merchants Bank, North and South City money houses, gold businesses, and exchanges were closed for the day.

<h3>Yarn, Raw Cotton, and American Cotton Initially Fall, Then Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to pressure from sellers, but then strengthened due to purchases by peers and short covering. Futures rose by 7 to 20 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 12 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged.

<h3>Woolen Overcoat Fabrics are Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Thick woolen overcoat fabrics have been heavily stocked by merchant guilds in recent days, and some transactions have also taken place on this street. Therefore, wholesale transactions of whole boxes by the trade association are extremely prosperous. Unfortunately, the arrival of goods is lacking, and the market inventory is insufficient to meet sales, resulting in prices rising sharply. Thick woolen fabrics that previously sold for 5 taels have now reached over 6 taels. Colorful woolen overcoat fabrics that previously sold for around 2 taels now sell for 2 taels and 8 or 9 qian. For example, Yongfeng's Fanghualedeng yarn woolen overcoat fabrics are now sold at a uniform price of 1 tael and 6 shi, which is more than 20% higher than at the end of last year. Yesterday, Hao Hualie Feng's iridescent woolen overcoat fabrics sold for 4 taels and 1 qian, Anlie's plaid woolen overcoat fabrics sold for 6 taels and 8 qian and a half, Lie Feng sold for 7 taels, Ning Feng sold for 6 taels and 2 qian and a half, Chanchen No. 20,000 was 2 taels and 9 qian, and Xinyi's Jiuzhongxian colorful fabrics sold for 2 taels and 8 qian, Yiji's Cailiantu sold for 3 taels and 7 qian and a half.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Autumn Cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are Continuously Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Statistics Reach Over 10,000 Packages</p>
<p>This year, the autumn silkworm farming in various counties and cities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been actively promoted by both government and merchants. The enthusiasm for raising silkworms has been quite high, and the number of silkworm eggs hatched has doubled. Silk cocoon merchants have also been ordering from various counties and cities due to the lack of raw materials. Cocoon businesses have prepared huge amounts of money to collect autumn cocoons, creating a temporary surge in activity. Unexpectedly, just as the silkworm larvae entered the first sleep stage, the weather suddenly changed dramatically. Continuous autumn rains and a sudden drop in temperature caused widespread silkworm diseases, and the cocoon production was generally poor, with low quality. The amount of cocoons collected by silk cocoon merchants has generally been insufficient. According to investigations, although autumn dried cocoons from various counties and cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are currently being shipped to Shanghai by both water and land routes, the total number is only over 10,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Autumn Dried Cocoons from Wuxi are Shipped to Shanghai Smoothly Every Day</h3>
<p>Over 5,000 Packages Arrive Continuously... Cocoons Boats Fill the Suzhou River</p>
<p>This year, autumn cocoons from various cities and villages in Wuxi have suffered from weather damage, resulting in a poor harvest and low quality. Only one-third of the cocoon businesses have opened scales. A total of 85 or 6 companies have opened in the entire county, but the amount of cocoons collected has been very limited. The cocoon businesses have gradually stopped weighing, and the collected autumn cocoons are now dried and transported to Shanghai in rotation. In recent days, over 5,000 packages of autumn dried cocoons from Wuxi have been shipped, mostly by boat. The cocoon boats are full of garbage in the Suzhou River area, and they are generally stored in bank warehouses.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Silk Market Effectively Suspended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in this port was effectively suspended. Because various manufacturers opposed public measurement and inspection, yesterday was the last day. The authorities still did not show any signs of cancellation. All silk factories in Shanghai followed the resolution of the general meeting and implemented the previous two or three taels of fall. The Russian Assistance Association for Gongxi has not yet officially opened, so there is basically no market to speak of.</p>
<p>The strike was to fight, in which, except for a small number of silk mills, such as Xinchang Ruilun, due to the relationship of undertaking the ocean line of credit silk, they were told to settle clear, and then rejoined, the rest were all temporarily closed, and other Sichuan, Lu and Li and other silk merchants also have a tendency to respond. The foreign silk market has been effectively suspended,</p>
<h3>Foreign Firm Tea Market Continues to be Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, black tea from Qining and other regions was still not asked about. Although French firms, Yongxing foreign firms, and Baitou businesses slightly inquired about Gaozhuang Zhenmei edge tea, the sales of ordinary Zhenmei were sluggish, the market price was declining, and the market situation was not good. There were few transactions in Zhenmei and Xiumei, and the selling price was relatively high.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Huanggang Qing Stocks Have Been Cut Off for a Long Time, Now Arriving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegram stated that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.03125, the price of New York futures sugar for December was still 1.01, the price for March of the next year was 1.10, and the price for May was 1.17. Compared with the previous telegram, each fell by one point. The current price of Javanese sugar was 8.375, the price of futures sugar for October was 8.25, and the price for November was 8.125. There was no increase or decrease compared with the previous one. The new price for December was 8.00. The trade association market divided the price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white, the transaction was still rare, the new goods were 8 taels, and the old goods were 7 taels and 8 qian. Finely ground sand white was 8 taels and 0.05 fen, the market situation was flat and tired, No. 9 Dutch red was 6 taels and 5 qian, the goods were lacking, and the market was charming. Japanese sugar N Mark was 8 taels 0 fen 3 li 7.5 hao, ) Mark was 8 taels 1 qian 7 fen and a half, Minghua YT Mark was 7 taels 8 qian 7 fen and a half, SH Mark was 7 taels 8 qian and a half, the transaction was deserted, the market was still weak, and the market was also quiet.

<h3>Seafood: Squid Supply Exceeds Demand</h3>
<p>New Goods Flood in, Trade Firms Loosen Market Prices</p>
<p>The existing stocks of old goods in various grades of squid have been sold through. However, according to telegrams from the production area, the harvest of new goods this year is quite abundant. Therefore, the source of new goods in recent days has been unusually active. The business of customer guilds is even more deserted. In places such as Sichuan, Hankou, Shantou, and Guangzhou, which are usually very prosperous, there is now very little activity, resulting in an oversupply and a thick bottom. Trade firm market prices have therefore gradually loosened. Yesterday's trade firm prices were: Xiangguan large slices of high-quality squid sold for 43 taels, medium slices for 41 taels, to 40 taels and 0.05 qian, picked squid for 39 taels, oil slices for 37 or 8 taels, cut blanks for 34 or 5 taels, paired squid for 42 taels, Jinshan squid high-quality goods for 40 taels, ordinary for 37 taels and a half. The market situation is very weak. Unless customer sales become strong, there is little prospect of rising prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Dentsu News Agency sent a telegram at 10:25 a.m., stating that Chicago wheat futures for September were at 7.5 jiao and 5 fen, December at 7.8 jiao and 25 fen, and March at 8.4 jiao and 625 fen.

<h3>Hardware: Small Branch Nails Sell Very Well</h3>
<p>The current inventory of small branch nails is limited, and sales from various customer guilds are very strong. Therefore, supply cannot meet demand, and the standard has become firmer. It is estimated that one fen is 11 taels and 5 qian, four fen is 10 taels and 0.05 qian, five fen is 10 taels and 0.025 qian, and six fen is 8 taels and 7 qian and a half. Yesterday, customer guilds from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and the Yangtze River area all made purchases. Therefore, over 340 to 350 barrels have been sold in the past few days.</p>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Xiong Zhaofeng</p>
<p>Our thoughts and actions are mostly governed by the environment. As a result, many weak-willed young people are buried in the tombs of the environment and cannot escape.</p>
<p>Regardless of the religion, the first step is to believe that outside the world of phenomena, there is another world that cannot be seen but is greater and constantly communicates with people. This concept is the fundamental belief of various religions throughout history and across cultures.</p>
<p>Human history is like a long record of the struggle for survival.</p>
<p>Life has its ups and downs. Only through adversity can one appreciate the sweetness and value of good times. Yuan Jianzhai said, "(Only after being sick do you realize how wonderful health is)," which is based on experience.</p>
<p>Before studying a problem, one should first pay attention to two aspects: (1) the actual problem; (2) the understanding of the problem. Understanding the problem comes from the actual problem and arises because of the actual problem. The practical aspect is fundamental, while the understanding aspect is not. Therefore, the most important thing about every problem is the practical aspect, not the ideal aspect.</p>
<p>(Generously sacrificing one's life) is a common occurrence in real society. But (calmly facing death) can only be done with great wisdom and courage.</p>
<p>Humanity is more valuable than nature, and spirituality is more precious than the body. (Response)</p>
<h3>Talking About Two Extraordinary People</h3>
<p>— Yu Yangzhou</p>
<p>Confucius did not talk about strange phenomena, physical strength, disorder, or gods. As for what is beyond the six directions, the sages preserved it but did not discuss it. However, the sages only preserved it without discussing it, not rejecting and disbelieving it. I have two extraordinary friends whose words seem shocking to the world, but their deeds are obvious and cannot be faked. Moreover, many scholars and officials in Shanghai know these two people, and they can be verified. They are not like the ancients who could make up stories. I suppose curious people would want to hear about them.</p>
<p>One is Mr. Qi Chunfang from Yuyao. Mr. Qi is the younger brother of Qi Hengfang, a prominent merchant in Shanghai. (Qi's name was no less famous than Yu Qiaqing's today a decade ago.) He possessed assets of over a million. At the age of forty, he suddenly met an extraordinary person who taught him the art of breathing and guiding. He has persevered for seven or eight years without wavering. He can absorb energy and abstain from grains, eating only a few red dates and a spoonful of water each day. He wears the same coarse linen clothing in winter and summer, not distinguishing between cold and heat. Moreover, he has not changed it once in seven or eight years, and it has no accumulated dirt, which is also strange. After learning the Tao, he used most of his assets to help charitable causes, and the rest he divided among his two sons. He then took a small boat and sailed among the green waters, not involving himself in worldly affairs. He only occasionally attends the spring festivals of his clan. Qi Yang, the former governor of Jiangxi Province, is also a relative of Mr. Qi. He said that Mr. Qi looks like he is in his forties, but his spirit is full of energy, and he looks no different from ordinary people. According to Mr. Qi himself, he can already know a little about good and bad fortune, but he does not tell people's fortunes. He also believes that his foundation is still shallow. If he perseveres, he may become a land immortal.</p>
<p>The other is Mr. Yuan Xilian from Baoshan (the younger brother of Mr. Guanlan). He works as a lawyer in Shanghai. Mr. Yuan once received secret mantras from a Zhuang monk, enabling him to drive gods and command ghosts. One day, a certain gentleman was stung by a centipede, experiencing extreme pain and fainting. Hearing that Mr. Yuan could cure it, he went to his door to ask for help. Mr. Yuan closed his eyes and chanted a mantra, summoning the centipede that had made the mistake, and investigated whether it had any previous grievances with the gentleman. Finding that it should not have stung him recklessly, he reprimanded it severely. The centipede immediately threw itself down the steps and died. It is said that if there are previous grievances, it is revenge for past wrongs, and there is no way to intervene. Mr. Guanlan's wife also knows incantations. Many friends and relatives who ask her to treat them also experience miraculous effects. However, she does not easily show them to others. The world is so vast, there is nothing that does not exist.</p>
<h3>Talking Before the Wine</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Last night, I was drinking with Mr. Zhang Shouyi. He said that the first cup tastes slightly bitter, which is the best taste. The second cup is inferior. I thought the person who warmed the wine did not do it properly. Mr. Zhang then said that in ancient times, wine was always drunk cold, never hot. The rites include the custom of washing the wine vessels, but not warming the wine. Sima Xiangru and Wenjun sold wine in Chengdu, only mentioning personally cleaning the vessels. Lady Guo of Tang Dynasty put wine in a deer intestine, tied both ends, and hung it on the beam. When she wanted to drink, she untied it and sucked from it with her mouth. If she wanted to drink, she would drink at any time, which shows that it was drunk cold. Only Bai Juyi's poem says, "Green ants float in newly brewed wine, a small red clay stove warms it. The sky threatens snow tonight, would you like a cup with me?" This may be the beginning of drinking wine hot. I said that today's wine comes in two types: yellow wine, brewed from rice, and white liquor, brewed from sorghum. Yellow wine is mostly drunk hot, while white liquor is drunk cold. Perhaps white liquor existed first, and yellow wine came later, so it was drunk cold. I record this to discuss with those who like to drink and study antiquity.</p>
<h3>Wang Shaolou, a Rising Star of Great Talent</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou is the brilliant son of Wang Yulou, a famous Peking opera actor in Beijing. He began practicing at a young age and showed extraordinary talent. He had both natural talent and the right approach. In the past, he and Li Wanchun supported the mansion of the Binqing Society for six or seven years and gradually showed his potential. Yulou trained his son very strictly, especially focusing on the critical issue of voice hoarseness, putting in the most effort to monitor Shaolou. As a result, Shaolou's voice recovered in a very short time and transformed into the sweet, round, and clear voice he has today. It can be said that he achieved his wish. His singing is purely in the style of Shu Yan, and his understanding is extremely rich. Moreover, he personally received instruction from Shu Yan, so his subtle nuances naturally closely resemble Shu Yan's style. Comparing his recordings from two years ago at the Victory Records, such as "Catching Cao," "Zhu Lian Zhai," and "Black Basin Case," with Shu Yan's recordings, one can see that he has never deviated from the original, even in the most subtle details. His physical movements and martial arts skills are solid, thanks to his strong foundation established in childhood. As for his elegant appearance and leisurely demeanor, he is truly a born talent. Moreover, he is at the prime of his youth and strength, and he does not have any bad habits like smoking or drinking to hinder his progress. With such a favorable environment, it is no wonder that he will make a splash. After leaving the Binqing Society this spring, he has frequently performed with Xue Yanqin in Beijing and Tianjin, and his reputation is rising like the morning sun. Many established male opera singers have been overshadowed by him and have become黯然失色 (dispirited). Cheng Yanqiu recognizes his ability and has invited him to perform together. The audience often praises their collaboration as mutually enhancing. She has never treated him lightly because he is new. As a result, Shaolou's name is well-known. I went to Beijing this spring and watched him perform various plays with famous actors such as Yanqiu, Delin, Shouchen, Miaoxiang, and Ruian. Shaolou was able to maintain the dignity of the leading role and win frequent applause. For a young man in his twenties to receive such special treatment, Shaolou has reason to be proud. This time, he is performing at the Shanghai Grand Theater. In addition to popular civil and military plays such as "Scolding Cao," "Catching Cao," "Battle of Taiping," and "Celebrating the Pearl," he will also perform Yu School's "Zhu Lian Zhai," "Dingjun Mountain," "Fa Chang Huan Zi," and the full version of "Borrowing the East Wind," "Qing Guan Ce," and "White Python Terrace." In particular, his collaborations with Yanqiu in "Fa Men Si," "Visiting Mother," "Zhu Hen Ji," "Scolding the Palace," "Red Mane Horse," and the full version of "Liu Yingchun" are most likely to attract audiences. People in Shanghai have not heard Shu Yan's singing for a long time. Now that his disciple Wang Shaolou is here, they can feast their ears.</p>
<h3>Recognizing the Value of Ziyi Ink Paste</h3>
<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of ink paste and seals on calligraphy and painting. However, no matter how wonderful the seal is, if the ink paste is not good, the seal's wonderfulness cannot be shown. Therefore, ink paste is especially important. There have been many ink paste making methods since ancient times. Some use mugwort down, and some use silk cotton, but they are not refined. Then, there are those who use willow catkins and wild down, which are of better quality and more miraculous. Those who use them think that their skills have exhausted all possibilities and cannot be improved upon. But they do not know that there is also a method using lotus root silk, which truly surpasses the past and present. The person who exhaustively studied the principle and created this method is Mr. Xia Ziyi, an ink paste expert in Shanghai. Mr. Xia has been studying this art for over twenty years. In the beginning, he felt that the ink paste available on the market could not fully satisfy him. He accidentally ate lotus root and obtained silk, and it was as if he had an epiphany. So he tried using the silk, and the results were very good. Indeed, methods using mugwort down and the like are not as good. Therefore, he mixed it with refined gold, beautiful split sand, and aged oil that had been stored for decades. Its miraculous features are that it does not consume oil, does not become sticky, does not bleed when stamped, and leaves no residue or stickiness on the stone after use. The carved text can rise up more than a millimeter on the paper, with edges on all four sides, which is exceptionally beautiful. It can be said that the ink paste is a sight to behold. There is also a type of wild down whose wonderfulness can also surpass others, being comparable to lotus root silk. Mr. Xia produces a total of eight types: miraculous, superb, highly refined, superior, excellent, and good. Lotus root silk is the divine product, while wild down is the marvelous product. The reason why he can achieve this level is that Mr. Xia does everything himself, from grinding the sand, splitting the silk, preparing the down, mixing the paste, and blending the oil, without relying on others. Therefore, there are no flaws. Moreover, Mr. Xia does not profit from this, but only makes it available to the world at the urging of friends. A gentleman not only perfects himself but also shares his happiness with others. I have seven or eight types of ink paste, and I always feel that they are insufficient when I use them. After a painting is completed, my mind and spirit are very happy, but if the ink paste is not good, I feel disappointed. After obtaining Mr. Xia's lotus root silk ink paste, even the slightly inferior types are carmine red, round, and lustrous, with a color like red beans, adding a lot of color to my humble paintings. Therefore, I now know that the secrets of heaven and earth are endless, and it is up to us to explore and obtain them.</p>
<h3>New Knowledge for the Family</h3>
<p>— Edited by Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>Invincible Butterfly Cream can eliminate wrinkles on the face, correct the sagging of the lower eyelids, and reduce crow's feet at the corners of the eyes. It is extremely effective. It should be used twice a day, morning and evening. Take a large amount with the middle fingers of both hands and apply it to the forehead first. Place the thumbs under the ear roots to allow the middle fingers to move freely and remove wrinkles on the forehead. Then, close your eyes and take Butterfly Cream with the middle fingers of both hands, applying it from the hollows of the nose down, turning along the lower eyelids, straight up along the corners of the eyes, and then down from the eyebrows towards the hollows of the nose, forming a circular shape. Massage for a long time until it dries naturally, and then women can apply powder, ensuring a very fine and comfortable application. Even if men do not apply powder, they will feel their face is like jade. Performing this massage daily can truly rejuvenate you. Applying it to the face overnight before sleeping can especially absorb nutrients and resist wind and dust. It is especially necessary for travelers. In the past, every time I went out, my face would always develop a brownish tint, especially during the summer in West Lake. This year, I used Butterfly Cream and spent three months as a guest on West Lake, and my complexion remained unchanged. Therefore, my whole family regards Butterfly Cream as a precious gift. (A Guest Returning from West Lake) Xu noted that the above massage method requires patience to persist, and women often dislike closing their eyes and not looking in the mirror. In fact, Butterfly Cream is harmless to the eyes. Just like Invincible Tooth Powder, rubbing it can actually draw out eye discharge from the corners of the eyes, which is very beneficial. I had many silken thread-like things in my eyes in the past, and they were cured because of this. The glasses I wear have also become weaker and weaker, which proves that it is not harmful but beneficial.</p>
<p>(P.S.) Invincible Butterfly Cream, the large size is priced at 7.5 dimes per bottle, and the second size is priced at 5 dimes per bottle. There are separate regulations for wholesale. It is available in department stores everywhere.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Communist Movement of Finnish Farmers (3)</h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>(2) The Results of the Lapua Movement</p>
<p>As more anti-communist organizations were established in various places, the methods for preventing communist activities also improved daily. In the beginning, they only requested that the government limit the freedom of communist parties to publish and meet, so that their propaganda could not be as smooth as before. Then, they announced that the communist party was a party that undermined patriotism and that all members of parliament and city councilors belonging to the communist party should have their right to attend revoked. Finally, they went on to advocate amending the current constitution so that the communist party would never have a foothold in the parliament and city councils. The following is a resolution submitted by the Lapua Movement's representative body to the President of Finland.</p>
<p>"Communist printing presses and newspapers should be immediately shut down.</p>
<p>Communist organizations in any form should be immediately disbanded.</p>
<p>Communist officials and their key members should be immediately arrested.</p>
<p>Legislative elections should be held after the above conditions are implemented and national security is restored."</p>
<p>The leaders of the Lapua Movement further made the following statement.</p>
<p>"To correct the various rumors about the anti-communist movement, we declare the following. In the southern part of Ostrobothnia, we only attacked one thing, which is communism. Outsiders do not understand the truth and mistakenly call it fascism, or think that we want to overthrow the constitution and implement a dictatorship. All of this is wrong. We will do our best to fight for our goals, and we will not allow any obstacles or difficulties to hinder our progress."</p>
<p>The strength that the Lapua Movement gathered in a short period of time was fully demonstrated at the Helsinki conference on July 7 this year. Twelve thousand farmers from all over the country came to participate in this conference. The President of Finland also attended the conference and gave a patriotic speech. The entire cabinet and General Mannerheim, the victor of the Finnish Civil War, also attended together.</p>
<p>A few days before the Helsinki conference, the government convened the parliament to implement the Lapua Movement's proposals through legal means. Several proposals to amend the current constitution were submitted to the parliament. The content was roughly to prevent parties that attempted to change the form of government from joining the legislature and to restrict the freedoms of assembly and publication. At the second meeting, most members of parliament expressed their support for the government's proposals. However, at the third meeting, the parliament decided to postpone the above proposals until after the next election. Therefore, the President of Finland announced the dissolution of the parliament. The next election is scheduled to be held on October 1.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (285)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Sheds Tears, Her Heart Breaks; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>The conditions had been settled, making it impossible for Cuiyun to object. However, as soon as she entered the door, various hardships gradually came. The first thing was that Zhang Yiqing's attitude changed greatly. When she lived outside, although he had one-third of the world, those ten days a month seemed to belong to her exclusively. Moreover, Zhang Yiqing cut off his dalliances after first obtaining his new love for several months. Everyone who newly acquires a concubine is like this. He swears to the heavens that he will no longer play around outside. After a year or so, he gradually felt monotonous and wanted to be active outside again. Since Cuiyun moved back, he seemed to treat her like an item. Once the ownership belonged to him, he was relieved. Having obtained Long, he desires Shu again. It was as if he wanted to obtain a beloved antique. Once he had it in his hands, he could put it on a high shelf. In short, he was not afraid of being taken away by others but was developing other ambitions. Therefore, he initially came back a little later, but later he still spent his days and nights in dissipation and was absorbed outside. The second thing was that Zhang Yiqing's wife's situation was also somewhat different from when Cuiyun first moved back. At first, she said that they would call each other sisters, but she never treated her with the etiquette of sisters. She even asked Cuiyun to do many things around the house. Although Cuiyun had been in a brothel for several years, she had also managed household affairs in her family since she was a child. Now that she was someone else's concubine, she was happy to do some household chores. Later, she taught her to pack opium. She did not refuse. Originally, girls from Shanghai brothels all knew how to pack opium. Although she could not smoke it, she liked to play with it the most. She thought, "I don't smoke anyway. It doesn't matter if I pack it for her." But once she started packing, she had to pack it forever. First, she laid off A'Bao, who had been packing opium for her. She said that saving one person would also save a little expense. She also told Cuiyun that A'Bao was unreliable. She had successfully seduced the master and was a source of trouble in the house, so it was best to dismiss her as soon as possible. In fact, A'Bao was originally unhappy here. It was nothing to pack opium during the day, but at night, in the middle of the night, sometimes it would last until dawn. If Zhang Yiqing lived with Cuiyun, and Zhang Yiqing's wife wanted to call Cuiyun to sleep with him, she would be unhappy and would not give her a good face. Sometimes, behind her back, she would tell the servants that Cuiyun was a fox spirit who was bewitching men. Therefore, when Zhang Yiqing's wife came to call Cuiyun, Cuiyun felt embarrassed and left. Only when she had smoked enough opium could she go to sleep. At least it had to be midnight. Zhang Yiqing's wife felt that bringing Cuiyun was for her to use, as if buying firecrackers to be set off by others.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>Empire Theater announces: "The film 'Circus Girl,' starring the newly emerging movie star Zhang Yuqing, has been screened at the Central and New Central Theaters and has won very good reviews. This is because 'Circus Girl' is Zhang Yuqing's first time on screen and her debut work. However, her mature expression is no less than that of well-known stars. The villain in the film, played by director Wang Cilong, performs the scene of robbing a girl from a good family and violating her in a secret cave. The situation is lifelike.
