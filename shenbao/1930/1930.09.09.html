<p>時評</p>
<h3>國際聯盟會將開幕</h3>
<p>此次之國聯會議。所以視爲國聯成立以來最重要之一會議者。以此次會議。難題甚多。而白里安之歐洲聯邦一問題。尤爲世人所注目也。在未開會前。世人多所揣測。皆以爲前途希望甚少。所認爲最困難之點有三。第一。爲國聯人員。對於聯邦計畫之懷疑。白里安氏於覺書中。對國聯與歐聯之關係。雖曾鄭重聲明。謂並非在國聯之外。另作一歐洲各國之組合。乃在國聯管轄之下。依照國聯之精神。以調劑歐洲各國之利益。且可贊助國聯解决其他問題。然而國聯中人。則至今尙未深信。故國聯秘書薩爾特爵士。力加抨擊。謂其大有害於國際聯盟。竊謂國聯與歐聯利害衝突之點。不先設法消除。則即此問題最大之困難。無法解免也。第二爲各大國之意見。紛歧太甚。雖未有露骨之反對。然亦無切實之贊成。其最顯然不滿意於歐聯計畫者。厥爲意大利。意電屢有表示。謂恐將引起他國敵對。且主力俄土兩國加入。又時發因歐聯問題而牽及修改國聯條約之論。與德國主張相同。蓋意法間國際之裂痕。日見其甚。意之不願由法國倡導之聯邦政策有成。實無可諱。此亦其困難之一點也。第三爲歐洲各小民族大會之表示反對。謂世界無論何種圑結。不能違背以民族爲基礎之原則。今白氏計劃。將使各民族間一切衝突益見緊張。不平等待遇。永久不能消滅。其言雖似過慮。然而此種震驚世俗之大計劃。易啓人疑其有稱覇弄權之心。弱小之國與民族。惴惴焉以此爲懼者。亦常情也。此又其困難之一點也。歐聯前途之難點甚多。此特其較顯者耳。</p>

<h3>參觀比展覽會誌感</h3>
<p>（邱祖銘自比國列日寄）</p>
<p>展覽會與賽會、性質不同、後者商業性質居多、如北平前門之夜市、在於售貨、直爲一種定期之市塲、前者則切磋與敎育性質居多、在於展示以、以資比較而求進步、最近一百五十年來、科學進步、一日千里、機器製造貨品、日新月異、二十世紀、或稱爲發明之時代、（Age　of　invention）因此展覽會之舉行、幾乎無國蔑有、無年蔑有、而且各種事業、均有特種展覽會、如汽車展覽會·飛機展覽會等等、予去年夏間至柏林時、其地正舉行廣告展覽會、掀動一時、最近在英國倫敦、有旅行展覽會、眞可謂無事不展覽、無事不求精不求新矣、我國工業、尙係手工工業、而甫求進於機器工業、手工工業、製造方法、墨守成規、而且出貨不多、不必競求於市塲、製成之物品、可以入古物院、而不足以進展覽會、譬如運輸器具、别國陳列汽車飛機、我國則陳列牛車馬車焉、惟近二十年來、亦已漸見有機器工業之製品出現、較諸他國固不逮、而比較舊日手工工業之製品、則已大有進步、故去年西湖博覽會、亦有相當之成績、本年比國慶祝獨立百年紀念、在列日與昻維斯兩城、舉行展覽會、予因暑假休沐之暇、由英渡海往觀、爰記梗槪、並誌所感、</p>
<p>比國之獨立百年紀念展覽會、不在一處集中舉行、而分在兩處舉行者、因比國八兆人民、人種顯分爲二、一爲華隆人種（Wallon）、近於法人、一爲佛來孟人種（Flemish）、近於德人、兩種人種之性質、語言絶異、故展覽會亦分在兩處舉行、至於絶不相同之兩項人種、能組成一個政治組織、稱爲比國、能產生一個政府、不以比武决雌雄、而以投票爲進退、則非本文所及、予擬另撰比國之研究一文詳論之、至比國展覽會、兩處不同之點、因昻維斯爲海口、類似我國之上海、係商業重鎭、故其展覽内容、屬於殖民的航海的性質、又昻埠爲佛蘭孟城市、附以佛蘭孟藝術之展覽、列日爲實業區域、類似我國之無錫、故其展覽之内容、爲科學的實業的性質、又列埠爲華隆城市、附以華隆藝術之展覽、茲將兩處展覽會、述其大槪、</p>
<p>昻維斯之會塲　地佔一百二十四英畝地形爲三角式、其陳列物品、分爲殖民部航海部與運輸部、參加國家、自以有殖民地之國家爲主要國、殖民地國家、當以下列諸國爲最大、</p>
<p>一大英帝國　　　一三·三○○·○○○方哩</p>
<p>四五○·○○○·○○○人口</p>
<p>二法國殖民地　　　四·○○○·○○○方哩</p>
<p>五五·○○○·○○○人口</p>
<p>三和蘭與殖民地　　　　八○○·○○○方哩</p>
<p>六○·○○○·○○○人口</p>
<p>四葡國與殖民地　　　　九八○·○○○方哩</p>
<p>一六·○○○·○○○人口</p>
<p>五意國與殖民地　　　　九九○·○○○方哩</p>
<p>六比國剛果殖民地　　　九一八·○○○方哩</p>
<p>以上諸國、均設專館、所有殖民地、均在亞非二洲、故各國殖民地之管理方法、敎育衛生以及經濟組織、均大同小異、可資比較、其中以英國館陳列各殖民地之發展史與比國剛果館之陳列剛果現狀、最爲詳備、（未完）</p>

<p>第二第三兩盤、林邱拍下留情、隨時隨地、頗予對方活動餘地、故雙方形勢、不無有渙散之處、第二盤之初二局、林邱陣線不固、乃被松永二下反抽、造成優勢、勝利遂歸日人、迨至三三之後、林邱一鼓作氣、終以六比三勝第二盤、第三盤林邱獲勝之比數與二盤同、然其變化之處、則林邱在四比一優勢之下、日人活動殊力、一時銳利難擋、未幾而成五比三之比數、（中華占先）後此日人雖欲加鞭、但林邱毅然再下毒手、加添一局、完成全功、</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 王瘦羊</p>
<p>世人的自視。每不失之高。即失之卑。其所以生高卑之弊者。大都存着一種較量心。有以致之。</p>
<p>越是聰明。越是智慧的人。越容易爲非作惡。越是下愚。越是蠢笨的人。越不易作爲。</p>
<p>人生有目的無目的。是哲學上一箇問題。但是無目的。便没意味。而有了目的。又說不出究竟。</p>
<p>世人每患一種不足的觀念。但在這種觀念之下。能創造事業。也能破壞事業。能達高明之境。亦能流入卑污之境。</p>
<p>青年的人。聽了父母的說話。無論是良言藥石。都覺忠言逆耳。聽了妻子的說話。無論若何絮聒。莫不奉爲金科玉律。</p>
<p>不要因了過失。推諉於人。以爲佔了便宜。須防他人的過失。也會推諉於你。</p>
<p>法蘭西大文學家囂俄云。（現在的世界。不當名世界。當名恨窟。）其言何等沈痛。</p>
<p>難求的事。都爲絶好願望。及至願望已償。心又索然。人們所有一切的非非想。皆當作遂願觀。則世上俱是好人了。</p>
<p>常人的修養。每得趣味於自已思想界裏。而樂在其中。反之庸人的佚樂。恒求之於界外。故常不平。常痛苦。</p>
<h3>追念曾農髯師</h3>
<p>— 張善孖</p>
<p>曾農髯師自國變以後。即避地海上。與臨川清道人李梅庵師。皆以鬻書畫自活。世所稱曾李者也。梅師旣卒。感悵頗多。世亂日滋。欲歸不得。嘗於浴佛日寫山水自題云。充揚子所至。則老矣。充墨子所至。則佛矣。舉世混混。吾誰與歸莽莽山河誰是主人。任筆所造。已落鴻濛之後矣。聊以自適。非敢求知。觀此可知其孤鳴獨醒之槪。然其神志老而益康。據案濡毫。從不告倦。稍休即與門弟子月旦書畫。品藻詩文。余與八弟大千。過從更多。承契彌厚。今歲五月。余進四十九歲。師贈聯云。兄弟高年文伯子。詩書善畫蘇長公。雖愧溢量之稱。實見奬掖之篤。又見師新爲魏弱叟老伯畫便面。題云。須到百齡無暮氣。同將六法樂天倪。復書其他面云。志能帥氣。故朝暮之氣。志主之耳。少而偷安。壯而躭逸。即暮氣也。熙與阿哥年俱七十。阿哥尙以書畫問世。熙雖盛暑不輟筆墨。即朝氣也。畫上題句。願與阿哥徵信之。蓋弱叟與師同鄉同年且同學。弱叟一日以長。故師以兄事之。余謂師朝氣長存。方當比壽大椿。不意入秋小恙。竟至不起。易簀前四日。尙手書一詩。與吳劍秋老伯云。自濬溪流常繞閣。手栽園柳已成堤。刦餘尙有敝廬在。惆悵年年歸未歸。案此詩即題思歸圖者。圖則爲弱叟作也。魂魄猶樂故土。於茲可徵。劍翁亦師三十年前老友。當師病時。移榻師家。一日師忽忽不樂。語劍翁曰。七十三年。丁此季世。能得友如子者。撫棺一哭。死復何恨。聲悽以永。所感深矣。故劍翁輓師云。何以生爲。睹茲滿地荒殘象。今眞死矣。尙有撫棺痛哭人。嗟乎。師之書畫已滿人間。師之聲明當流後世。全壽而歸。雖死猶生。吾輩山頽木壞之感。不能已於懷。江漢秋陽。願與及門諸子共誦之。（却酬）</p>
<h3>曾先生遺墨</h3>
<h3>湘潭之木本鳳仙</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>九苞顏色春霞萃。丹穴威儀秀氣攢。此晏殊詠鳳仙佳什也。鳳仙爲草本植物。莖高尺餘。初秋吐花。爛然文采。舊時婦女。往往擷之以染指甲。亦紅閨韵事也。頃有友人方子葆初者。湘潭人爲述其家香隣小築。有一本本鳳仙。高一丈有餘。花色殷紅。一如草本。葉亦似常。自秋孟至冬仲。歷五月之久。花開不絶。結子堅硬若鐵。撮播他處。槪不萌芽。故湘中無第二株也。葆初之父遂生公。吟誦之餘。喜栽卉樹。以灌漑芟翳爲樂。某歲秋日。鳳仙盛放。忽風雨交作。疾電下擊。一鳳仙之莖。自根而斬。不之意。越日。莖又生苗。漸長漸高。居然草而幹木矣。遂生公以爲祥異。乃就其旁築木鳳仙館。爲舒嘯宴樂之地。距今已十餘年。一年一花。尙未萎悴云。</p>
<h3>垃圾桶中的一幕</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>垃圾桶。雖則是藏垢納污的所在。却也含着幾分神秘的色彩。所以有時會有情書發現。零縑斷片。得之者每覺此中饒有奇趣。但這是兩性戀愛的初幕。還有情塲歷刦。結下了禍胎。生下了非正式的結晶品。無法措置。往往裝了個蒲包。暗暗地抛棄在垃圾桶裏。也有活着的。也有已死的。這種怪現象。我們在文明都市中的街頭巷尾。常常可以瞧見或聽得。至於要問這是誰人製造。誰家抛棄。那就無法追求。所以這垃圾桶。簡直是（神秘之庫。）不知包含着多少的艶史和慘劇咧。</p>
<p>却說一天午後。在下應診赴南市。行經王家碼頭附近地方。有一具垃圾桶旁邊。有多人圍着。在下好奇心動。也加入參觀。原來這垃圾桶中有個蒲包。盛着一個（男性）已死嬰孩。墊以石灰。肌膚紅潤肥壯。異於常兒。那腦殻已被擊碎。腦漿迸裂。面部血肉糢糊。慘不忍覩。這不消說是個私生子。是被擊斃後而抛棄的。當時觀衆中有搖首太息的。有申申而詈的。在下看了。也發生無限感想。這嬰兒倘使生在有錢或平常無子的人家。眞是何等歡喜。並且抱着無限的希望。但偏生在那不正當的結合中。所謂（惡之欲其死。）竟被置之死地。可憐他無知無識。遭此殘酷的手段。斷送了小性命。又無人爲之鳴寃。這眞是世間最不平的事。所以從法律上講起來。也應加以制裁。事關人命。也有澈究之價値。還有一層。我望地方人士。遇有私生子發生。呱呱墮地。决不會没有人曉得。但也有當時被悶死的。事前宜加以勸導或警告。倘撫養不便。囑其送入育嬰堂。切弗任意抛棄。那衛生局或婦孺救濟會。最好定出幾條章程來。庶使一般私生的嬰兒。得着一重生命上的保障。將來也可立足社會。這眞是講人道主義中。一件値得注意的事啊。</p>
<h3>癡殉記</h3>
<p>— 陳伯英</p>
<p>趙生鍾。吳縣人美丰姿。嗜文藝。而鈍於言詞。呐呐不能出口。年方弱冠。一夕在新舞臺觀劇。見包廂中一女子。雲鬟霧髩。服蜜色長裾。外襲淺紅半臂。雙瞳澄澈若秋水。生詫爲天人。爲之注視不他瞬。迨閉幕。生急趨門前候之。見女挾伴行。忽囅然一笑。齒如編貝。潔白無倫。生不覺神往。女出門。登車行。生亟喚街車乘之。以躡其後。女抵所居。闔門入。生乃誌其門牌號數而返。女張姓。字采芹。杭州人也。父爲鉅商。時方肄業某女校。是夕初未見生。其笑也。蓋其伴語以劇中滑稽處。故忍俊不禁。無他故也。生自是日駕自由車俟之。終不得見。女宅有醫生與之同居。生乃僞爲病者求診。數數往。亦不獲望顏色。如是者數月。生之渴慕彌甚。然采芹固未知也。時大疫。采芹死。厝棺寺中。輒見一少年日置花一束於棺前。則生也。生自女亡後。鬱鬱不樂。未一月。即嘔血死。旣死。兩家稍稍推其故。頗憫生之痴情。而傷其寡緣。遂舉行冥婚云。</p>
<h3>戰後波蘭之内政（二）</h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>在此形勢之下。臨時政府之第一着。乃召集一立憲議會。但在議會尙未成立前。臨時政府已發佈多種命令。其最重要者如認定每日八小時工作制度。强制防疫法及强迫敎育案等。此外如工作監督。勞工組合。鐵路及他種公用工作用途之徵取等。均有明令規定。其後立憲議會成立。最初通過之諸法案。如改革地制。公衆衛生及警察制度等種種法律上之措置。其目的均在使波蘭全國上下有一共同遵守之律令。是爲波蘭獨立後對於行政統一上最初之努力。</p>
<p>經波蘭全國一致通過之重要律文。乃一九二一年三月十七日之立憲法案。此法案即構成現在新波蘭之憲典也。一切問題。包括無遺。立法權與有政權之產生。全國人民强迫兵役之規定。人民信仰自由之確認等。悉載於此。總之。在一種槪括之形式下。此法案已明白規定人民之義務及其應享之權利。</p>
<p>但此法案之成立。尙不足以消除波蘭經歷一世紀以上之分裂痕跡。蓋自最後一次瓜分後。波蘭一國分成三部。行政與立法等制。絶不相類。所賴以維繫波蘭商人之祖國觀念者。惟各處通用之波蘭語文而已。此經過長久分析之波蘭。亦自須經相當時期始能成名實一致之統一。乃至明顯之事。</p>
<p>故行政與司法兩部分。以前瓜分時代之法制猶大多認爲有效。此乃一種由環境逼成之實在情形。並非立法者所願。立法者之志。在使波蘭成一施行地方自治制之統一國家。而不欲波蘭成一各自爲政之聯邦國家也。</p>
<p>波蘭行政大綱亦經此憲法規定。全國分作十六邵（Voierodie）每郡之下又分爲鎭（Starostie）與村（Commune）等。根據地方分權。與地方自治之原則。各區均由人民選舉之議會襄助政府官吏執行政務。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二七二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>寗波地方人還有一種冐險的精神。所以在國内。不論那地方新關一口岸。先來經營商業的。便是寗波人。而且他們篤於鄉誼。同鄉人每肯汲引同鄉人。拔茅連茹。自然漸漸的成了國内一部份勢力。所謂（吃得苦中苦。方爲人上人。）寗波人很能服膺這兩句話。且說翠筠所嫁的那個男人。也是寗波商人之一。要講他的出身呢。亦甚寒微。但他能不絶地和困難去奮鬭。又能不絶地抓住了他的機會不失掉。現在他居然做到了長江輪船上的一個買辦。此人姓章號乙青。討翠筠的時候。年紀也已經四十多歲了。凡是一個年輕的姑娘們。誰不願意嫁一個年輕的男人。難道倒喜歡中年已過的人。那時翠筠不過二十左右的人。要和章乙青的年紀比較起來。章乙青做伊的父親。也綽綽有餘裕。怎麽甘心就嫁了他呢。翠筠那時是自由身體。並不是做人家的討人呢。可是伊是從情塲中經歷來的人。在伊那裏的走動的客人。也並不是没有年青的人。天下事往往不得兩全其美。年輕的大都輕浮不務實際。有的財產權不在他們的手裏。有的瞞了家中父母私自出來玩的　。那種青年。即使嫁了他。也是將來没有什麽好結果。而且近於冐險性質。在那種勇於冐險的姑娘們。那就不顧他少年老年。暫圖目前享樂。一面主不絞取你的金錢。到了享樂也大家厭倦了。金錢也絞完了。你走你的路。我走我的道。各自東西。不相關涉。也有的緣前回所說的。早存了淴浴之心的。翠筠却不作此想。伊總想嫁了一個靠得住的人。安分守守。不作出山之想了。但是從許多年輕的客人中。暗暗的揀來揀去。總不滿伊的意。就中有一位　。伊倒很可以滿意的了。可是伊有心於他。他並没有心於伊。這也不能掗給人家。就中還有一位。伊也有心於他。他也有心於伊。無奈他已有了夫人。而他的夫人。又是决不容許他討姨太太的。要是翠筠着那個客人。一定要嫁他。也未始不可秘密進行。圖徼倖於一時。但伊知道决不能有好結果。不但害了自已。又害了他。恰巧那時候。那個章乙青又釘住了伊。他的人是怎樣的能幹。交際又怎樣的廣闊。因爲伊見别的寗波人。總是硬綳綳的。他却對於伊是怎樣的體貼柔和。</p>

<p>人標賣力高壓　人標前市開盤　以外棉趨跌、場中買風缺乏、市盤稍跌、各月均跌一·二·三·四·錢、午後聞川帮現銷較爲良好、人心略振、且多數議論美棉明日看漲、二三盤買氣又平、收盤回跌、結果與上市相仿、全日成交統計一萬二千一百五十包、查賣出瑞大九百包、榮興六百五十包、達豐七百包、義記六百五十包、申新七百五十包、漢豐愼昌利昌永昌廣豐恒益大昌成三百包至四百五十包買進愼記八百五十包、和愼同興吉豐益裕森康福和恒昌協生振大三百至四百包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<p>現銷較見活潑　現紗銷路較爲活動、查全日各帮買去統計一千六百二十五包、同行中進五十包、行情平平、四川進六百七十五包、廣東進五十包、天津進一百零五包、蘆州進九十包、汕頭進四十五包、鎭江進九十五包、内地進二百四十五包、内地期貨五百包、徐州進一百六十包、雜帮進一百六十二包云、</p>
<h3>棉市蘊伏之局</h3>
<p>棉市始跌後堅、但美棉趨勢平澹、惟本埠多數心理一致看高、以美棉明日估計大槪減少、在一千四百萬包以内、兼之白露節氣午後天降幾點微雨、認爲與棉樹大爲不利、做多者較衆、人心一致觀上、市勢愈緊一步、而預測估計爲一千四百萬零零八千包、但漢帮前後兩市抛出一萬四五千擔、據友云湖北年景良好、現棉各廠仍無問津、明日市面當有極大變化也、</p>
<p>漢標回軟　漢標前市開盤、以美棉又跌、人氣平疲、跌二錢、二三盤以天時不正、悶熱異常、買戶較湧又漲、結果跌五分至一錢、午後形勢驟緊、謂美棉有上漲之望、天時又降微雨愈挺、各漲二錢、後以有一部份抛出回跌、結果漲五分至一錢、全日成交統計四萬八千八百擔、查買進恒德三千二百擔、愼記一千一百元泰一千一百、和愼一千四百、振大一千五百、大昌成一千七百擔、其他八九百擔、賣出愼昌八千一百、元德三千六百擔、昌記一千八百包、其餘一千四百至八九百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>美棉私家估計</h3>

<p>六日紐約電、美棉第二次收成報告、定於八日發表、茲以各私家估計爲根據、預測其當常年產額百分之五四·二、計一四○○八、○○包、</p>
<h3>英印棉業週訊</h3>
<p>孟買　上週運輸商購買現貨、頗形活動、本地廠家僅買若干急需、期貨平淡、營業因抵制英商、殊受阻碍、和平運動失望、政局解决無期、聯省奔傑及辛特方面之棉收消息、均形滿意、奥姆辣區域、週内亦有進步、附錄上週統計如下、單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市續趨平疲</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮到源十號之譜、市銷益形不振、但高貨尙可維持、緣貨稀關係也、故頂粳</p>
<p>行情祗略行欠佳、中次則又削角半、狀况尙難站立、刻下照二十元帶零之米、已極合上中之品格矣、東新粳仍開十八元、售戶防受殺而觀望、但天能連晴、不免下游也、新客尖特頂貨開十四元關左、各路來源稍減、價較前日續疲二角至一角不等、白元到銷兩稀、市無榮枯、大盤自十九元至十八元半、新洋秈情勢平平、價乏上落、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到船不多、仍祇寥寥數號、本街進胃雖可、然因閘市之疲弱、及天宮之連晴、人心欠佳、因此粳米續告軟化、而此間北破頂粳已數市乏到、棧存亦極缺少、蘇同中次粳亦覺甚枯、行情勉回角外、南帮薄早稻市形呆而無神、來源雖覺凋零、然買氣亦不暢、是以盤面隨閘方之粳米而轉移、全日交易寥落、大勢平疲之格、東新粳到稀市定、價盤旋於十八元至十七元半、通變貨實奇枯、頂元須十九元關口、</p>
<h3>客秈有天津去胃</h3>
<p>昨日客秈續有江西到貨、湖南亦有少數到申、但湖南已正式開禁、此後恐有大批續到之實現因湘省正式開禁後之護照捐較上月裝出者减少一元、成本旣减、販戶當然興味轉濃也、故申市甚呆、價小近角、全日由天津帮辦裝一千包係湘砶米、價十一元七八角、江西米爲本街暢辦、銷化較佳、市乃居定、計開出機早二千包、價十三元四角半、十三元、十二元八角、機晚八百包價、十四元九角、十四元十三元六角云、</p>
<h3>標粉市復入軋境</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面　又呈步軟之勢、雖洋麥報價回漲四五角、惟實銷已懈、天津帮仍不能裝運出口、所以各廠方面、態度已不若前之堅勁、兼之洋粉麥定價已經接近、若本粉不廉洋粉之定碼、勢必逐步增加、故各廠雖未大抛但前途局面終恐難已開展也、結果本月份較前週小二厘半、十月份小一分、十一月份小五厘、十二月份小二厘半、正月份小二厘半、二月份小五厘云</p>
<h3>期麥晚市抛盛突跌</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈盤旋之象與上週收價、無甚上落、迨至下午開後、初仍平穩、旋以遠期如十二·正·二等月、突由某大戶、盡量抛售、數達五六十車、據一般人之推測聞係廠家之套頭、故人心轉軟、市勢步趨不振大致洋麥定價接近、廠家之目光自須轉變也、結果本月份較上週回跌三分十一·十二月份跌三分、正·二月份各跌五分、現麥市况客路到源、仍見接續、惟各廠辦胃、依然不前、照此種堅擯不辦、此後各檔開價、必須修削無疑、昨開台兒莊·山東·瑤灣麥千餘包、由行家吃進、尙未配廠云、</p>
<h3>糖市日糖湧到市弱</h3>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訉、古巴現糖及紐約期糖均無到電、爪哇現糖價八·七五○、期糖十月份價八·五○、十一月份八·三七五、比前電各回跌一二五、公會市場劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白交易仍寥、暫通陳貨八兩、新貨色潔白拉粗之貨八兩三錢、進出甚懈、中砂白等亦少成交、荷赤以到貨轉湧、市氣更弱、雖未有進出、市形已露趨跌、日糖Ｎ嘜八兩一錢二分半、ＹＴ嘜八兩零七分半、ＹＲＯ嘜七兩九錢七分半、ＹＰ嘜八兩一錢七分半比前步跌二分半、交易殊爲凋零、實因走化呆滯、長江等處更以太古糖分銷處跌價錢半、於是問津愈靜、且明治糖已續有運抵、雖多家仍思扳緊、已覺頽風難挽之槪矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨　　新泉泡圓前批登塲</h3>
<p>泉州新泡圓、因該處同業定同時出口、不得爭先、故到申反延遲幾天、且爲數增多、共計三千外箱、昨日已由華恒輪裝到、此間新同圓已跌三盤、適値市疲、難望善沽、查此批高貨價划三十七兩左右、勢必虧耗、蓋昨市行盤又降一二兩矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶紹興新秋繭已上市</h3>
<p>統扯有八分收成···改良種繭價看高</p>
<p>紹興四鄉農民、今歲因官廳發售改良種、絲繭商宣傳提倡、故均飼育秋蠶、飼額不亞春蠶、收蟻而至三眠足葉、蠶汛頗佳、氣候調和、迨至大眠旺葉、天氣驟變、秋雨連綿、加以寒冷、致蠶蟻發生、變化不眠不食、備受損害、四鄉新蠶已上市、各繭行開秤者十之五、繭產統扯八分年歲、繭價以改良種最高、價開六十元、普通四十至五十元、</p>
<h3>疋頭東貨漲風極猛</h3>
<p>本廠布　市面連日無甚榮辱、惟走銷已不若以前之暢、原由邇來東疋漲風甚猛、本客目光轉移、　故銷路大减、但廠存甚枯、所以尙無下落發現、昨十六磅粗布寗波帮略有成交、王老爲七兩一錢半、雙象七兩、五鶴七兩二錢半、細布因染銷不動、北帮亦呆、昨略見軟、藍雙魚已售六兩九錢半、陽鶴六兩九錢、獵人六兩八錢、細斜仍硬、内地帮需要頗殷、陽鶴售開七兩二錢半、金城七兩一錢、藍雙魚六兩八錢二分半云、</p>
<p>東西疋　昨東貨又漲、大有不可響邇之勢細嗶嘰又高二厘半至五厘、湖心亭二錢七分半、已有定下、現貨售二錢七分、紫金山開二錢六分七厘半、直貢緞均漲一分、五路已須三錢七分二厘半、八駿三錢六分七厘半、鵲橋會飛馬童一致二錢八分二厘半、餘者若棉法絨月華絨洋紅標光斜等亦莫不見硬、去路除未街異常活動外、昨青島徐州四川等帮均有大批採辦、觀察後步、大有繼長增高之勢、西貨亦挺、但去路則不相懸殊云、</p>
<h3>五金吩釘本客交易極旺</h3>
<p>吩釘本街生意近甚熱鬧、故數日來成交達六七百桶之多、而出口如長江内河福建諸帮、連目亦多點綴、故市場中談判之旺、幾與東白鐵等相彷、行情刻市如三分售十二兩、四分十一兩五錢、五分十一兩、六分八兩七錢半、查近來到貨極少、而積存又薄、市面前途殊抱樂觀也、</p>
<h3>雜項水泥定出七百桶</h3>
<p>昨日象牌水泥、由本埠某建築帮定去七百桶、價三兩七錢半、查係北蘇州路某五金號經手、聞近來象牌交易甚爲活潑、良以行情低廉之故耳、</p>
<h3>雜訉湘米又到五千一百包、</h3>
<p>麥粉三千九百包、運赴汕頭、</p>
<p>藥材六百件、裝往香港、</p>
<p>香烟一靠千三百箱、運往南善、</p>

<h3>吳淞夜遊</h3>
<p>— 蘇讀餘</p>
<p>玲·瓊·蔭林·和子、以及我自已、一共五個人、大家高興、約着到吳淞去玩、說起玩大家那裏會不高興、於是計劃的决定、在十四日往那海邊去、</p>
<p>本來就已約定的、四個人在下午七時玲的家裏匯齊、到那天我在六時半就吃了晚餐、—不、點心罷了、到那廣東氣味充溢着的北四川路玲的家、</p>
<p>她看時鐘、還祇六點三刻、很驚奇的對着我、然後說、</p>
<p>（你的表快一點吧、）</p>
<p>我不懂她的意思、經她說明、才知道是說我爲何這樣守時、因爲她是滿想我們極起碼七點半才會到的、我當時就想說幾句的、可是心裏像有一個細小的聲音對我說、（你又要發你慣發的老生常談了嗎、）這纔將我的宏論收轉、改着打趣的話說、</p>
<p>（早一點來不是可以將辰光縮短一點嗎、）</p>
<p>她被我這句話把她的腦子纏昏了、張着疑惑的神氣、睜着眼僅看我、在她的表情中、深深的給出一個問號、……</p>
<p>我默默的微笑、向她看了看、說、</p>
<p>（我覺得在你家、那隻時鐘就會快了許多、）</p>
<p>她輕快地浮着笑容、似乎這樣說、（那末你不會將你的時鐘旋得快一點的嗎、）終於她是這樣對我說了、我們哈哈的笑着、其實、祗要不是痴子、笨牛、還會不懂我的話意嗎、我料到、她那裏會不懂呢、</p>
<p>七點鐘敲了、在不久以後、幸虧大家不失約、瓊·和子·蔭林、三個人、同時到來了、問他們爲何這樣巧、一起來、才知道他們是由和子到各人家中去約着來的、</p>
<p>人一齊、自然拔起步子就走、由蔭林和我提着點心、和子拿汽水、玲同瓊、她們合攏了一隻放杯子等什物的皮爽、各人有了職使、於是就搭公共汽車到天通庵車站、因爲現在行了小火車、每天有七十七次的開行、祗、須隔上十五分鐘、就有車可乘、看看火車開駛時刻表、下次祗有二分鐘就有車往吳淞了、我們就急急的去買票、雖說是（急急、）可是依舊是你推我擠的像有甚麽好處似地搶着去購票、其實這種客氣太無謂了、倒不如各人自買來得直率、然而當時、理想却戰不過環境、我也擠上去想購票、這眞呌我奇怪、—在結果、和子終於替我們各人買了、</p>
<p>等到車來、又用了一次（擠）、終算没失散、五個人登在同一個車箱裏、隨後車是開行了、鬱悶的車箱中、才有點風進來、在風中、雖雜着多量的煤烟、可是比悶着終好了許多、</p>
<p>車子搖擺着向前進行、不五分鐘、就是江灣了、立達學園四個方形的大字、伴着一顆紅色的心、—這是立達的校徽—赫然顯生眼廉下了、可是火車急急的過去、我不能看見立達中的許多學友、不知他們現在做甚麽、祗能這裏寄語說着對不起、—不能同游哩、這其中、尤其是知友伍君、以及朱溫二女士了、</p>
<p>經過立達、是江灣站、停了一下、那勞働大學？立着的大自鳴鐘、顯明地射入視線、從大時鐘向左、那面有立達對站着、在這二個學校的中間、夾着幾許房屋、在幾許房屋中、學友程女士、就住在裏面看、我也祗能用着（無可如何）的眼光看了那邊、終也本能和她同游呀、</p>
<p>車再一次的開行、拉了一聲汽笛、終把我的視線拉回車了、和玲？依舊很懽暢的談着、雖然程朱？們没有來、可是有玲在這裏、她跟程眞太相像了、也是和程一樣的把短髮在後面分爲兩叉、十足表示出一個天眞的女郎、再說瓊那玲　的口才、和朱也有多少分别呢、至於蔭林和子他們、也很愛閙笑、有了他們、還會寂寞嗎、</p>
<p>雜亂的談話、又繼續不息的流動着、車在吳淞的站頭上停了下來、一個個都蒙着高興、提着各人的什物跳下了車、我們五個再談笑着走到江瀏去、</p>
<p>一輪皎潔的明月、燃着清麗的白光、洒在地下的一切上、海水微縐起波花、在凸起凹落的水波中、反照着月光像閃着眼似的、鱗片樣的細碎、星星般的晶亮、平靜的海中、雕刻着無限的美麗、抬頭望天、除去幾顆較大的星座、尙能一見外、餘多不知千萬的小星兒、像被明月逼不過似地隱藏了、我不禁將這意思告訴了大家、瓊却打趣似的指指海面、月光照耀的波紋、現出一點點的像星一樣的亮光、？没有說話、就笑起來了、最後才强住了笑說、</p>
<p>（讀餘、在這裏呢、）</p>
<p>我佩服她的口才了、我希望、她的胸中也有這樣倔强的星星鑽進去、照得她滿肚子都是光明、同時我不辜負她指示的盛意、回答她說、</p>
<p>（哦、牠們才眞是倔强呀、牠們雖然敵不過月的威武、然則、然則牠們會來另一個地方創造牠們的世界呀、）</p>
<p>（不過、讀餘、牠們是虚僞的呀、你肯注意到牠們這一點嗎、）玲　對我這樣說、我不免被這句話沉入思念中去了、</p>
<p>（可是這樣美的水波、我能這樣忍心說牠們是僞的星兒嗎、）我說、</p>
<p>海濱除去海水輕撞着海岸、發着細小的水聲以外、祇有我們的皮履聲及、以及玲和我的談話、她像掬出了她的心似的、很熱心地談着這樣的話、五個人的十隻眼睛向無邊際的海洋巡視着、不時有幾艘輪船冒着黑烟成了一條細線、遙遠地在水天相接處出没、於是我會這樣說、</p>
<p>（這氣象是多麽壯闊啊、）</p>
<p>向來主張普羅文藝有存在的必要的和子、他却反對地說、（但是你知道輪船中駛船的火夫、以及機匠們的痛苦嗎、我們現在這樣逸緻的在這裏夜游、而他們正在受苦呀、）</p>
<p>他是自以爲普羅文藝的愛好者的、從前我也和他同一樣的讚好過普羅文藝、可是最近民族文藝運動的急潮、打動了我的心、我客觀的認清普羅文藝的虚僞了、我久已决定與牠遠離、從這樣决定以後、我曾以民族文藝的特質以及使命詳細在朋友中宣傳過、雖有收到一點效騐的、但是像和子、他有時會承認民族文藝之好處、可是一忽又會去贊成普羅主義了、今夜他又這樣古調復彈、我不免發起我的論調來了、對他說、</p>
<p>（和子、你應當明白普羅文藝的虚僞、不受牠的驅使呀、級階戰爭是極其畸形的、在蘇俄、或有他的環境使然、可是在中國、環境昭示了我們、並不是階級的弊害致中國這樣貧弱、實在是帝國主義者的横行與壓迫使中華民族輾轉於污泥中呀、你現在所說、船中火夫等痛苦、這痛苦我們是應當同情的、假使他是替中國商船出力、雖然他受了辛苦、但這是他國民的天職、應該爲國家的交通事業出力的、我們現在談民族、不應再專以（精神文明）來自欺人、要兼從物質文明追上東西洋著手了、這交通事業是物質文明的一種、牠能爲物質文明做一步基本工作、這種工作是有意義的、向上的、我們就得嘉贊他們、鼓勵他們、你想對不對呢、至於他們的生活費問題、我以爲自然應該優厚一點的、因爲在滿足的生活下、才能替社會造出更良好的功績呢、）</p>
<p>他又像是服從了、應着（是的、是的、）</p>
<p>輪船的烟囱中冒着絲絲黑烟、出没在水天相接處、遙遙地、五個人都默默地靜步着、</p>
<p>時間在談笑中消逝了、帶去的東西也盡裝在各人的肚中、明月也已高升、掛在頭頂相近、大家提議回去吧、一致的通過、就跨着輕鬆的步子、懸着一顆盡了興的心、走入火車去、</p>
<p>車子又載着我們到天通庵站了、寥寥的車中幾個人、舉着他們的步子、各自踏着靜寂的馬路回到他們的目的地安宿去了</p>
<h3>一個提議</h3>
<p>無情底韶光、如流水般逝去、轉瞬又是秋高氣爽的天氣了、一般久受着赤帝勢力壓迫下的人們也覺到一些凉快、在這時候、各個學校都紛紛忙着預備開學、一班放浪了一個暑假的學子們、又不得不自已蹩頓一下、重新拿起書包到學校去念書、但在未進學校之前、就發生一個問題、問題是什麽呢、彷彿在學校兩扇校門上寫了這幾個字（學校重地無錢莫入）、當然是進學校先要付學費、這個學費問題、在富家子弟是没有什麽困難問題發生、而貧家子弟呢、在此米珠薪桂時期、父兄用汗血金錢來開銷一家尙不能溫飽、那有閒錢給子女求學呢、爲了這萬惡的金錢不知埋没了多少有志青年、爲了悲憤而走入消極的路—墮落的是很多、這是多麽使我們悲傷而痛心呀、</p>
<p>在我個人感覺到國家的强弱、對於敎育是有密切的關係、我國衰弱到如此地位、也因敎育不普及—民衆缺乏智識、我們要國家强盛、必定要普及敎育、要普及敎育、必定要解除上面個難題、但怎樣來解除他、學校有一切開銷、當然不能給我們白讀的、唯一辦法、就是要政府來多設立幾個工讀學校、來培植這班有志向求學而没有能力的人、這樣做去、我相信敎育能普及我國能强盛起來、（佩貞）</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>訪問蕭伯納（一）</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>—七十三歲的可愛孩子—</p>
<p>斯惠爾司篤克在（論始報）裏面發表關於蕭伯納的文章、他說、我有生以來最覺興奮的、要算最近單獨和蕭伯納等逗在一起的那個時候了、我没有遇見個、也不像再會碰到、一個更加可愛的七十三歲的孩子、倘然無論那個婦人都可以原諒妒忌的、那個婦人便是蕭伯納夫人了、因爲伊丈夫的可愛、使得他所遇見的人都稱贊他、他的青春是是完全迷感的、他是這樣的年輕、清瘦和喜悅、使人疑心他像浮士德一樣的、和魔鬼訂下什麽秘密契約、明白的說一聲、他是一個青年人、要保持他的青春直至於死、倘然身體的健康大有價値、那末他死的這一件事、大槪在我活着的當兒不至與遇着、我想還有五十年的工作可做哩、</p>
<p>傳說一個溺斃的人臨終的時候、在一刹那間看見他一生的過去事跡、但是倘然蕭伯納萬一到這個田地—這是老天所不許的—他所看見的、决不是已往的而爲未來者、他的傾向與他同年紀的人不同、對於未來抱有極大的興趣、絶端重視進步、他對於新創的東西非常注意、我問他道、（你對於有聲電影發生興趣麽、）</p>
<p>這是一個愚笨的問題、但是我往往聽見前輩紳士們、對於有聲電影加以非難、而老先生們對於這個小小譴責又很起勁、這樣子、在我想到與我講話的是一個具有熱忱的青年之前、這句問話已經從嘴裏滑出來了、</p>
<p>（我對於有聲電影有很大的興趣、）蕭伯納回答說、（我要告訴你是什麽緣故、）他眞的告訴我、他說、他對於這種新創的電影很有趣味、因爲有了這個媒介、他終能把他戲劇的完美出品公之於世、</p>
<p>）這是不可能的、（他說、（在舞台上取得一個完美的戲劇出品、譬如一位戲劇指導者、很用心的去練習脚本、在星期一晚上看看近於完美了、可是誰敢說、到了星期二牠要變成怎樣呢、後有一個伶人能復演一個脚本毫不走樣、第一個晚上看看很好、到了第二夜便退步了、但是影片就有一個好處、角影片攝取戲劇可以得到完美出品、像却潑林那樣那能夠費去許多時候、將一段影片、弄得十金十美、最後他將各個片段接連起來、這個結果就成了一個完美的出品、傳之永久、）</p>
<p>（那末以前你爲什麽不答應把你的戲劇攝成影片呢、）我問蕭伯納說、其實我早曉得這個問題的答案、但是我要他親口回答我、</p>
<p>他說、（在有聲電影没有發明之前影片商不要我的戲劇、就是别人也是一樣、我曉得他們收買劇本、但是爲什麽呢、戲劇是由對話造成的、在攝製影片的時候、把對話完全去掉、所以一個成功的影片戲劇、本身上完全不是戲劇了、）</p>
<p>常常澈底的</p>
<p>蕭伯納常常是澈底的、我記得腓力浦吉勃士爵士告訴我伊是怎樣的驚奇、在大戰的時候、當伊將這個戲劇家帶到飛機營中去、聽見他對人家講關於他們機器上的許多知識、好像一個老練的機匠、對於有聲電影也是一樣、蕭伯納很細心的研究這件事好像是他的終身事業一樣、他對於聲音的複製不明瞭的地方很少、近幾年來他很有興味的研究留聲片、和别種紀儲聲音的方法、</p>
<p>他對我說、（困難的就是個人呌無經騐的愛美劇家、去動作或者講話、他從來不將最關重要的動作講話的快慢告訴伊們、若干年前、一個影片攝製者要求我給伊攝一段影片、他們對我說康拉和仁惠爾都已經過試騐、我就答應了這個請求、當卡麥拉攝取我的動作時候、我走進一間屋子、除掉我的帽子、坐下來、拿筆在手裏開始著作的工作、我照着每天的老樣子很自然的做這幾個動作、可是當我看見在銀幕上映出來時、他就變成這個樣了、）</p>
<p>在我們談話的這個當兒、蕭伯納從榻椅上昇起來、將銀幕上映現的動作摹倣給我看、這個證明他是一位有才具的伶人好像他的戲劇天才一樣、他每一個姿勢奇形怪狀敎人發笑、好像是用一個慢動作的卡麥拉所拍攝的、</p>
<p>他從新坐下來說、（他們應該告訴我約束自然的舉動、你明白一個人不必爲影片而動作、祇要輕輕的移動、即使一個人的思想能給卡麥拉翻成動作、一個伶人祇要想把一個印象移上銀幕去、）蕭伯納又鄭重的接着道、（我的意思不是說大半的電影明星能夠自已想想自已、不過一個製片家可以告訴他們想些什麽、）</p>
<p>回復到聲音複製的問題、蕭伯納說、（那件事的成功也是一樣、要靠着製片時圓盤旋轉的速度、當其慢慢旋轉的時候、收蓄的聲音正確而容易辨别其士音、事實上一個留聲機片呌人吐露自已本來面目罷了、一張唱片調和了他適腚的快慢、能夠很明白的表示這個人的出處、在鄉間我家裏有一張片子是以前所灌音的、那張片子如果慢慢的開動起來、能夠聽得出我操着精鄙的愛爾蘭音、我唱着傢杜白林街頭上的老丐、如果速度增加起來我的聲音漸漸的合乎正則、終止於你聽見像我現在說話一樣、</p>

<h3>Progress of the Right Wing Army on the Pinghan Railway Line</h3>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Telegram Reports the Occupation of Xihua</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Secretary-General of the National Government received a telegram from Gao Lingbai of the General Headquarters, Yuxu Division, stating that our army's right-wing army on the Pinghan Railway began its offensive on the 1st and completely occupied Xihua on the 5th at noon, capturing a large amount of spoils. The rebel army collapsed towards Fugou and is being pursued vigorously. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Yuanquan telegraphed to Nanjing on the 7th, stating that the Liu Guitang division in Xihua relied on strong city walls and pre-built fortifications, drawing water from the Jialu River to flood wide and deep moats, resisting stubbornly. After repeated attacks by Gu Changjun's brigade of our division, they successively occupied important villages and strongholds attached to the city of Xihua. The enemy retreated and stubbornly resisted, relying on the county seat. On the 5th, our army surrounded and fiercely attacked Xihua from the east, south, and north sides, ordering Xu Jiwu to launch a flanking attack on the enemy at Liansi Wangyingdian to cut off their retreat to Tongxu and Fugou. On the 6th, Liu Xushi's brigade was again ordered to form an encirclement by maneuvering from Shiyang towards Longchi Hudangcheng. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the county seat was occupied on the afternoon of the 6th. After prolonged street fighting, the enemy's casualties were heavy, and they were unable to hold out. They finally broke out of the west gate and fled towards Fugou. After being intercepted in sections, many were captured or killed, and countless spoils were seized, which are currently being inventoried. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The fighting on the Pinghan Railway line has fully unfolded. The enemy on the front line, Shi Zhenqing and Deng Baoshan's divisions, are entrenched in Xuchang city. There are no enemy traces south of Xuchang city. Our army is maneuvering to the right flank to attack along the Changge Xinzheng line. Yang Hucheng's army has already attacked Dengfeng. The Feng army in the Xinzheng Heshangqiao area has been greatly shaken. In the Xihua Fugou area, fierce fighting has been ongoing for days. Zhang Weixi's division of the enemy in Fugou has suffered heavy casualties, with more than half killed or wounded. Xihua has been occupied by Xu Yuanquan's division, and many enemies have fled in disarray. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Military news reports that the National Army on the Pinghan Railway is using a new battle plan. The right wing has crossed Wuling Xichuan, and a portion is heading straight for Xinzheng.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Assembly is About to Open</h3>
<p>This session of the League of Nations Assembly is regarded as one of the most important since the League's establishment because it faces many difficult problems, particularly Briand's proposal for a European Federation, which has attracted worldwide attention. Before the meeting, there was much speculation, with many believing that there was little hope for the future. The three most difficult points were: First, the skepticism of League of Nations personnel towards the Federation plan. In his memorandum, Briand solemnly stated the relationship between the League of Nations and the European Federation, saying that it was not to create a separate association of European countries outside the League of Nations, but to reconcile the interests of European countries under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations and in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations, and to assist the League of Nations in resolving other issues. However, the League of Nations personnel still do not deeply believe this. Therefore, Sir Eric Drummond, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, strongly criticized it, saying that it was very harmful to the League of Nations. It is believed that if the points of conflict between the League of Nations and the European Federation are not first eliminated, then the greatest difficulty in this issue cannot be resolved. Second, the opinions of the major powers are too divergent. Although there is no overt opposition, there is no concrete approval either. The most obvious dissatisfaction with the European Federation plan is Italy. Italian telegrams have repeatedly expressed concerns that it may provoke hostility from other countries, and they also frequently raise the issue of the inclusion of Russia and Turkey and the revision of the League of Nations Treaty, which is the same as Germany's position. The international rift between Italy and France is becoming increasingly apparent. It is undeniable that Italy does not want the federation policy advocated by France to succeed. This is also one of the difficulties. Third, the Congress of European Minorities has expressed opposition, saying that no matter what kind of world organization, it cannot violate the principle of being based on nations. Now, Briand's plan will only make all conflicts between nations more tense, and unequal treatment will never be eliminated. Although their words seem to be an overreaction, such a shocking plan is easy to arouse suspicion of hegemony and power struggles. It is also normal for weak countries and nations to fear this. This is also one of the difficulties. There are many difficulties in the future of the European Federation, and these are just the more obvious ones.</p>

<h3>League Administrative Council Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>Accepts Report on Palestine Unrest</p>
<p>Disturbances in Geneva</p>
<p>Resemble a Large Beehive</p>
<p>Briand's European Union Plan</p>
<p>Becomes Focus of Discussion</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 8th – The League of Nations Administrative Council held its first meeting here today, accepting the report from the Mandates Commission regarding last year's unrest in Palestine. When Dr. Procope (Finnish representative) presented this report, he earnestly stated that the assembly should not view this as the Mandates Commission attempting to exclude the Mandatory Power from fulfilling its duties, but rather as acting on its behalf. He also said that Great Britain, with its experience in governing nations with different characteristics, still faced particular difficulties regarding the Palestine mandate, indicating the arduous nature of this task. If Britain did not encourage the Jewish national home or develop the existing system in Palestine, it could only offer warnings. However, based on past results, Britain's policy should not be subject to this warning, etc. Then, British Foreign Secretary Henderson rose to reply, stating that the British government was deeply gratified to read in the report about the difficulties of governing Palestine. The Mandates Commission believed that Britain's declaration on suspending the issuance of Jewish immigration permits was sufficient to alleviate the concerns of the Jewish people, and Dr. Procope also shared this view, which the British government considered fortunate. The British government will soon issue a declaration on future policies for governing Palestine. The British government recognizes that promoting goodwill between Arabs and Jews is essential for the peace and prosperity of Palestine. Subsequently, the Administrative Council unanimously accepted the report.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – The League of Nations will hold a meeting in Geneva this week. The Administrative Council is scheduled to open on Monday, and the assembly will convene on Wednesday. One of the significant events of this meeting is French Foreign Minister Briand's European Federal Plan. Briand will speak on Monday afternoon, seeking to have his plan formally included on the assembly's agenda. National representatives have differing opinions on this plan. Britain argues that any special European grouping should be strictly within the scope of the League of Nations. This view is supported by many, but there is some debate as to whether the economic or political aspects of this plan should be further developed. It is expected that the British representatives will not be willing to undertake any further political obligations beyond those of the League's member states, but there may be no objection to shifting to the economic aspect. British Foreign Secretary Henderson had a meeting with the Canadian representative yesterday and will continue to maintain close contact with representatives of the overseas autonomous territories.</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 7th – The French delegation, led by Foreign Minister Briand, and the Polish delegation, led by Foreign Minister Zaleski, arrived here tonight, being the last to arrive among the delegations attending the Administrative Council meeting. Delegations from Germany, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Austria, etc., also arrived during the day today. The current situation here is as bustling as a large beehive, and Briand's European Federal Plan is the focus of discussions and speculation. The formal invitation for this plan, which will be discussed on Monday afternoon, has been distributed to the representatives tonight. It is reported that the Italian representative still strongly advocates inviting Turkey and Russia to join the federation.</p>

<p>Argentine Military Government</p>
<h3>Holds National Authority</h3>
<p>Orders the Expediting of Presidential Elections</p>
<p>Irigoyen Regains Freedom</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 7th – According to news from the capital of Argentina, the Argentine revolutionary movement is victorious everywhere. The newly formed military government has seized national authority. General Uriburu, the Prime Minister, issued a proclamation this afternoon declaring that presidential and congressional elections will be expedited.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Argentine Capital, 7th – According to today's news, President Irigoyen's resignation was due to the success of the revolutionary army in La Plata. Irigoyen happened to be there at the time and was detained by the revolutionary army. He was sent to the headquarters of the Seventh Infantry Regiment for detention, and his letter of resignation was written at that time. The revolutionary army telegraphed it to the authorities in the capital. The temporary government has now replied by telegram ordering the release of Irigoyen. After learning of this telegram order, Irigoyen wept with his attendants, and the onlookers were also moved to tears. Irigoyen is now trying to leave to avoid the crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters, Argentine Capital, 8th – Although former President Irigoyen is no longer imprisoned, he voluntarily remains in the La Plata military camp. He is very ill, and his daughter is by his side, with two doctors attending to him.</p>
<p>Reuters, Argentine Capital, 7th – It is now reported that fifteen people died and one hundred and ninety were injured in the Argentine revolution. According to news from the provinces, although the provincial governments have not been replaced, the people have declared a revolution.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th – News from the Argentine capital indicates that although almost all soldiers in the Argentine army joined the revolution, its success was largely due to the participation of four hundred army students. They first responded after seeing the revolutionary signal from the aircraft. As for the eight regiments of soldiers originally scheduled to launch the revolution at the Mayo Camp, they did not join at that time. The police and civilians mostly supported the revolutionary party. After the government fell, the whole city celebrated all night long. Another telegram states that everything is calm in the Argentine capital today. The new government has issued a proclamation declaring that those who conspire against the new government will be executed without trial.</p>
<h3>Polish Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Oppose Redrawing of German-Polish Border</p>
<p>Reuters, Warsaw, 7th – Fifty thousand Poles, including representatives from various political parties, gathered in Poznan today, the birthplace of German President Hindenburg, to hold demonstrations against Germany's plan to revise the German-Polish border and against the remarks of German cabinet members on this matter. Afterwards, a resolution was passed advocating the defense of the Polish western border and boycotting German goods. Similar demonstrations also took place elsewhere in Poland. Demonstrators in Warsaw even hung a portrait of Dr. Treviranus, the former senior official in charge of the occupied territories in Germany, on a gallows, because Dr. Treviranus had stated that the border must be fairly resolved for Poland's future to be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Conditions in Japan and the United States</h3>
<p>Differ Greatly</p>
<p>Japan United, Tokyo, 8th – There are currently 378,000 unemployed people in Japan. In addition, there are unregistered freelance laborers, totaling more than one million people. This is an increase of 110,000 people from May of last year to May of this year.</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 7th – According to the "Weekly Review" here, the unemployment situation in the United States has changed from negative to positive. In addition, general business conditions are also trending upwards. Oil, food, and raw materials are showing signs of stability.</p>
<h3>Leader of Turkish New Party Promotes Platform</h3>
<p>Developing Republican Work</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Freedom of Speech</p>
<p>Reuters, Constantinople, 7th – Fethi, leader of the Turkish Free Republican Party, was originally scheduled to deliver a speech to the public in Smyrna on Saturday, but due to disturbances, he changed it to today. There was a large audience. He briefly stated that the ruling party had spread a rumor, referring to the newly established opposition party as a restoration party that wanted to restore the use of Arabic script. In fact, the purpose of the opposition party is to develop President Kemal's republican work and to guarantee freedom of speech and the responsibility of the rulers. Turkey certainly needs to build new railways, but he does not approve of the contract concluded with the Swedish and German groups because it is too burdensome.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Visiting the Belgian Exhibition</h3>
<p>(Sent by Qiu Zuming from Liege, Belgium)</p>
<p>Exhibitions and competitions differ in nature. The latter is more commercially oriented, such as the night market in front of Qianmen in Beiping, which is for selling goods and is simply a periodic market. The former is more focused on exchange and education, displaying items for comparison and progress. In the past 150 years, science has advanced rapidly, and the manufacturing of goods by machines has been constantly innovating. The 20th century is sometimes referred to as the Age of Invention. Therefore, exhibitions are held in almost every country and every year, and various industries have special exhibitions, such as automobile exhibitions, airplane exhibitions, and so on. When I was in Berlin last summer, there was an advertising exhibition that caused a stir. Recently, there was a travel exhibition in London, truly showcasing and perfecting everything. China's industry is still a handicraft industry, just starting to move towards machine industry. The manufacturing methods of the handicraft industry stick to conventions, and the output is not large, so there is no need to compete in the market. The manufactured items can be placed in the museum of antiquities, but are not enough to be displayed at an exhibition. For example, in terms of transportation equipment, other countries display cars and airplanes, while China displays ox carts and horse carts. However, in the past twenty years, we have gradually seen machine-made products appear. Although not as good as those of other countries, they are a great improvement compared to the old handicraft industry products. Therefore, last year's West Lake Exposition also had considerable achievements. This year, Belgium celebrates the centenary of its independence, and exhibitions are held in the two cities of Liege and Antwerp. I took advantage of my summer vacation and traveled by sea from England to visit. I will record a brief overview and my thoughts.</p>
<p>The Belgian centenary of independence exhibition is not held in one centralized location, but in two locations because the eight million people of Belgium are clearly divided into two races: the Walloons, who are close to the French, and the Flemings, who are close to the Germans. The characteristics and languages of the two races are very different, so the exhibitions are also held in two locations. As for how two such different races can form a political organization called Belgium, and how a government can be created without resolving disputes through military force, but through voting, it is beyond the scope of this article. I plan to write another article on the study of Belgium to discuss it in detail. As for the differences between the two Belgian exhibitions, Antwerp is a seaport, similar to Shanghai in China, and is a major commercial center, so its exhibition content belongs to colonial and maritime navigation. Antwerp is also a Flemish city, so it is accompanied by an exhibition of Flemish art. Liege is an industrial area, similar to Wuxi in China, so its exhibition content is scientific and industrial. Liege is also a Walloon city, so it is accompanied by an exhibition of Walloon art. I will now describe the general aspects of the two exhibitions.</p>
<p>The Antwerp exhibition site covers 124 acres and has a triangular shape. Its exhibits are divided into colonial, maritime, and transportation sections. The participating countries are mainly those with colonies. The following countries have the largest colonies:</p>
<p>1.  British Empire 13,300,000 square miles</p>
<p>450,000,000 population</p>
<p>2.  French Colonies 4,000,000 square miles</p>
<p>55,000,000 population</p>
<p>3.  Netherlands and Colonies 800,000 square miles</p>
<p>60,000,000 population</p>
<p>4.  Portugal and Colonies 980,000 square miles</p>
<p>16,000,000 population</p>
<p>5.  Italy and Colonies 990,000 square miles</p>
<p>6.  Belgian Congo Colony 918,000 square miles</p>
<p>Each of the above countries has a special pavilion. All the colonies are in Asia and Africa, so the management methods, education, health, and economic organization of the colonies are generally similar and can be compared. Among them, the British pavilion displays the development history of each colony, and the Belgian Congo pavilion displays the current situation of the Congo, which are the most detailed.

<h3>France Seeks to Reduce New Budget</h3>
<p>German Imports Increase Sharply This Year</p>
<p>National News, Paris, 7th – "Le Journal" reports that the French government's new budget has been cut by nearly 600 million francs, and its total amount is comparable to this year's old budget. The largest cuts were made in the four departments of colonies, army, navy, and air force.</p>
<p>National News, Paris, 7th – In the first seven months of this year, France's imports were highest from Germany, valued at 4.7 billion francs, compared to only 3.6 billion francs in the same period last year. The United States was second, valued at 3.7 billion francs, compared to 4.3 billion francs in the same period last year. This is because France has a movement to boycott American goods after the United States implemented new tariffs, so it has been greatly reduced. Britain ranks third, valued at 3.2 billion francs, which is also a decrease compared to 3.5 billion francs in the same period last year. As for the amount of French exports, Germany ranks third.</p>

<h3>Unwilling to Assist in Rubber Restriction</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – After a meeting between the Governor of the Straits Settlements and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, it is now stated that both governments are unwilling to formally assist in any method of rubber restriction. In view of the Dutch Governor's opposition, the Straits Settlements government believes that unilateral action is useless and harmful. Therefore, it told the Malay rubber industry representatives that the government has decided to listen to the natural evolution of economic principles, hoping that this will promote the stability of rubber prices.</p>
<h3>Another Dispute in Japanese-Russian Fisheries</h3>
<p>Japanese Fishing Nets Cut by Russians</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th – According to a report from Shin Kotsu Maru to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Russian surveillance ships conspired with crab fishing vessels to cut fishing nets from Karafuto Maru and three other Japanese hired ships, totaling about 19,500 sections (each section about 2.6 fathoms), worth about 100,000 yuan. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has today requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to demand the return of the cut fishing nets from the Russian government and to lodge a formal protest.</p>
<h3>Results of International Beauty Pageant</h3>
<p>Miss Brazil Wins First Place</p>
<p>Reuters, Brazilian Capital, 7th – The results of the International Beauty Pageant: Miss Brazil, Pereira, won first place. Second place was shared by the ladies from Portugal and Greece. The United States took third place. Twenty-six candidates, all dressed in evening gowns, lined up. Then, they walked slowly in front of the judges in walking clothes. Bathing suits were rejected.</p>

<h3>Commemorative Week at the Central and National Government</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on the 8th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 76th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Great Hall. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Wang Chonghui, Liu Luyin, Chen Guofu, Ke Xing'e, and others, along with staff from various departments and invited guests, totaling about 500 to 600 people, attended. Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Wang Chonghui delivered a report, stating that recently, the reactionary elements in the North are increasingly failing. Their plans involved: (1) Using the Communist Party to disrupt the rear areas of the Central Government, but the Central Government was prepared. The majority of the Communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have been defeated, and local security can be assured. (2) Using imperialists to spread rumors, claiming that Northeastern troops had arrived in the interior on a certain day and stationed in certain places, and that Commander Zhang Hanqing had cooperated with Yan and Feng, serving as a committee member of the Northern government. However, recent telegrams from Commander Zhang to Chairman Jiang, and telegrams to the Central Government from Wu Tiecheng, Fang Benren, Zhang Qun, and other comrades staying in the Northeast, have proven these claims to be false. It is now known that Commander Zhang's determination to support the Central Government in completing unification remains unwavering, and their attempts to confuse the people have failed. Recalling that since the Party established its capital in Nanjing, it intended to quickly restore peace, complete unification, and implement political tutelage and reconstruction. Unexpectedly, the reactionaries repeatedly betrayed the Central Government, resorting to arms and creating chaos, resulting in a fragmented nation and displaced people. This is a great misfortune for the Party and the country. However, the Central Government is taking this opportunity to defeat the reactionary warlords one by one, urging them to eliminate themselves as soon as possible, so as not to be an obstacle to the country and society. This is a blessing in disguise. Examining global precedents, those with principles will prevail, while those without principles will fail. In 1786, when the United States implemented the federal system, President Lincoln advocated for the emancipation of slaves. Southern people, due to conflicts of interest, insisted on opposing it and withdrew from the Union. At that time, Lincoln said, "False doctrines without principles can only deceive a part of the people and can never deceive all the people." As a result, Lincoln's policies were eventually implemented. Linking this to the fact that all reactionaries in our country only know how to protect their individual territories, not hesitating to harm the country and deceive society, we can confidently judge that their fate is doomed. However, this war has caused significant damage to the nation's vitality, and the people's suffering is indescribable. It is hoped that after the victory, Party comrades should work even harder to instill the Party's principles and missions into the hearts of the people nationwide, increasing their faith, to eliminate future reactionaries. Next, Dai Chuanxian reported on his recent trip to the front lines to express condolences, stating that he departed from Nanjing on the 25th of last month, first arriving in Guide to meet Commander-in-Chief Jiang. He then traveled by car to Liuhe, convening a meeting of the commanders and division commanders of the front lines, announcing that the Central Government highly commended the brave and sacrificial spirit of the armed comrades at the front, who have been victorious in all battles. While expressing condolences, he still hoped that they would continue to advance, eliminate the remaining enemies as soon as possible, and achieve complete success. He also hoped that the Central Government's intentions would be widely conveyed to all armed comrades at the front. Commander-in-Chief Jiang, representing all senior military officers, expressed sincere acceptance and deep gratitude, adding that the Central Army was confident in its victory in the campaign against the rebels and would be able to annihilate the remaining reactionary forces without leaving any behind in the shortest possible time. He then transferred from the Longhai Railway to the Jinpu Railway and saw that the two railway bridges at Dawenkou, which had been destroyed during the retreat of the rebellious Jin army, had been repaired. He first went to Jinan to meet with Commanders Han and Ma, announcing the condolences, and the troops were extremely excited. He then returned south, and when passing through Qufu, he learned that the enemy had bombarded the city day and night with intense artillery fire, but the Central Government's city defenders were resilient and able to preserve the famous city. However, the Confucian Temple was slightly damaged by enemy artillery fire, and the Yan Temple was even more severely damaged. He had already discussed with Commander-in-Chief Jiang to allocate funds for repairs in the near future. The area is a representative area of Chinese culture. The man-made forests within the area are very lush, a rare sight on the plains. This alone is enough to demonstrate its cultural significance. Yan Xishan has always used veneration of Confucius as a banner, but the army that destroyed the sacred sites is Yan's army, exposing his hypocrisy. Along the way, the spoils of war were piled up like mountains at various stations. However, most of the captured guns were manufactured by Japan, which is particularly noteworthy. This year's harvests in Shandong and Henan provinces are abundant, a very good sign. As long as the military operations are concluded, bandits are suppressed, and order can be stabilized. Regarding party affairs, he did not have time to investigate this time, but he heard that the organization of the lower-level party branches was very unsound, and there were very few party members. The Central Government will strive to reorganize this in the future. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Jiang Menglin, Yi Peiji, Zhang Nanxian, Zhu Peide, Lin Xiang, Zhu Lihuo, Li Mianlun, Zhu Jingnong, Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yu, Liu Dabai, Mu Xiangyue, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Xiqian, Wu Siyu, and others, as well as staff from the civil and military affairs departments, totaling more than 200 people, attended. Tan Yankai presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report as follows: (Today, I will briefly report on a few things: (1) The military operations are about to end. The Northeast has consistently supported the Central Government. The two rebels, Feng and Yan, are at the end of their rope, while some rebellious and treasonous reactionary elements are still running to the warlords, dreaming of organizing a puppet government. Seeing the depravity of these people, we cannot help but feel infinite emotion. Fortunately, the society has recently become somewhat aware that psychological reconstruction is urgent. I believe that psychological reconstruction must start with the word "loyalty." Do as much as you can. Even if you offend someone, you must speak when you should. Even if there are obstacles ahead, you must do what you should when you have the opportunity. As long as your conscience is clear, and as long as it is beneficial to the Party and the country, you do not need to care about temporary praise or criticism, and you do not need to worry about personal gains or losses. Only with this spirit can you be considered loyal, and only with this spirit are you qualified to talk about revolution. As for those who are sneaky, they will eventually fail. Those who are too clever and lack a bit of foolishness, and those who see the gains and losses too clearly, will certainly not be very successful. I hope everyone will pay attention. (2) Hunan currently has the Fourth Route Army and the Third Instructor Division troops. There is no danger to the security of Changsha and other places. Especially after Feng and Yan are eliminated and the overall situation is stable, it will not be difficult to suppress the Communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces. What is worrying is that in the places where the Communist bandits have been entrenched for a long time, the social foundation has been destroyed. It will not be easy to handle the aftermath in the future. We should plan and prepare in advance. (3) The disaster situation in Hao County this time is tragic. The State Council decided last Friday to allocate 30,000 yuan for emergency relief. Looking at the whole country, whether affected by military operations or harassed by Communist bandits, the local losses are very large. Once the military operations are over, the government will plan the relief efforts as a whole. Recently, there has been one good thing, which is that there have been no natural disasters. Several provinces have signs of a bumper harvest. Most of the people in our country live by farming. Once there is a bumper harvest, the shortage of food and other goods can be reduced. However, we must pay special attention to local security during harvesting and post-harvest storage, and we must ensure that people can live in peace and no longer be displaced. (4) The governments of Shandong and Anhui provinces have been reorganized, and the list of committee members has been published in the newspapers. We hope and believe that they can sincerely seek welfare for the people of the two provinces.)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Clears Bandits in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the retreat of the Jin army and the breakout of Gao Guizi, the bandit troops recruited by the Jin side and bandits from various places took the opportunity to rise up and harass the local areas. Han Fuqu has sent troops to suppress them. According to a gentleman from the Staff Office of the 22nd Division, the division was ordered to suppress the bandits. Division Commander Gu Liangmin is currently stationed in Tianzhen (east of Qingcheng) to command. The pseudo-temporary First Army of Shi Fengming, recruited and organized by the Jin side, has fled northeast from Zhoucun, attempting to cross the river. The 65th Brigade of Tang Yaoxun and the 66th Brigade of Ning Chunxiao are following and pursuing them. Shi Fengming was dispersed by the Tang Brigade, and the pseudo-Chief of Staff Ren Pinsan was captured. Shi took the remnants and retreated north, now on the south bank of the Yellow River in Lijin County, attempting to cross the river. He was rejected by the Jin side and is now in a desperate situation. It is expected that the problem will be completely resolved within a few days. The pseudo-regiment commander Wang Shaozhou's unit, about 800 to 900 people, occupied Shijia Kou between Guangrao and Lijin. On the first of this month, they were completely defeated by the joint attack of the Ning Brigade and the Zhao Xinde Brigade of the 12th Army. Bandit Wang barely escaped with his life. The pseudo-regiment commander Cai Guanjun has fled to the vicinity of Boxing and is being sent troops to suppress him. It is expected that the bandits on the south bank of the Yellow River will be completely eliminated within a few days. As for the remnants of Gao Guizi, they have now completely crossed the river. In addition, Li Shuchun, the Chief Counselor of the First Army Corps, commanded the suppression of bandits in Guangrao. There is a recent telegram reporting the process of resolving the Wang Shaozhou bandit unit. The original telegram is as follows: (The Wang Shaozhou bandit unit, occupying the history family's mouth, about 800 to 900 people, relying on the dangers of the village walls, looted nine out of ten families, Vice Commander Xu led my Zhao Xinde Brigade to encircle the east morning, attacked the village at ten o'clock in the morning, fought fiercely for two hours, Brigade Commander Zhao personally led the pistol team and one battalion of the third regiment, using artillery fire to cover, climbed in from the east, Bandit Wang, seeing that the situation could not be supported, only took a small number and fled to Changle, was head-on attacked by my Ning Brigade, Bandit Wang only escaped with his life, in this battle, the Zhao Brigade killed 300 bandits and captured more than 100 bandits, and captured more than ten large vehicles and more than 100 guns from the Ning Brigade.)

He claimed that a Mr. Lu in room 15 of the Continental Hotel had asked him to take the printed materials to Qimen. Officer Wang suspected Song of being a reactionary and took him into custody. He then went to room 15 of the Continental Hotel to see if there was a Mr. Lu. He found people gambling inside and arrested the gamblers Lu Fusheng, Lu Achun, Li Genfa, Wang Jinlin, Yuan Genji, and others. He asked Lu Fusheng and Lu Achun if they knew Song Qin, but they all stared blankly and said they did not. They were taken into custody because they were related to the suspicion. Also, at around 7:00 PM, police officers from the Second Precinct arrested a suspected counter-revolutionary monk in the Sanyuanfang Jiecao Hermitage and took him to the bureau for investigation.</p>

At 1:05 AM yesterday morning, it arrived at Suzhou Station and then headed north. Near Railway No. 116 and telegraph pole No. 94.19 near Huguan, it was stopped and dense gunfire was heard. Although the lights of the train head were visible from Huguan Station, the police force was small and it was inconvenient to go and investigate due to the gunfire. At 1:30 AM, when the second night express train arrived in Suzhou from Shanghai, Suzhou Station had not yet received a report that the twenty-seventh train had reached Huguan Station. It immediately sent a telegram to inquire, but the telegraph and telephone lines between Suzhou and Huguan were suddenly out of service. Another line was used to relay the inquiry from Mangting to Huguan. As the truth was unknown, Station Master Huang Jiaxiong reported that the twenty-seventh train was stopped there, fearing an accident. He immediately telegraphed the General Station's Vehicle Department and requested that the military police be dispatched. A platoon of military police stationed in Suzhou, accompanied by road police officers and laborers, took a push car to investigate. They found that telegraph pole No. 19 had been destroyed and had fallen on the railway, but there was nothing else. The telegraph pole was removed, and at around 4:00 AM, the train safely proceeded.

<p>Reasons for the Rise and Fall of Rice Prices Rice prices in Wuxi have been soaring recently due to continuous rain and interrupted supplies. New white rice rose to 19 yuan per dan, causing panic among the common people. It is now known that 800 tons of new rice have arrived the day before, so white rice prices on the market fell by three yuan yesterday, to 16 yuan per dan. However, there are no supplies of new white indica (i.e., Bianjiang indica) and new guest rice, so rice prices are expected to remain high. New white indica is priced at 11.10 to 10.10 yuan per dan, and new guest rice is 5.40 to 4.80 yuan per dan. But wheat sales are sluggish, at 8.15 yuan per dan.

Yesterday, more than 20 bandits suddenly came to Zhoucun, carrying weapons, surrounded the village, and demanded 1,000 yuan in support, otherwise they would burn the village. The villagers were shocked. After the security teams of the neighboring villages arrived after hearing the alarm, the bandits left, shouting and screaming. Before leaving, they burned six or seven thatched houses on the east side of the village. The village has telegraphed the province requesting troops for protection. Also, a family in Hanjia Village outside the South Gate received a letter from the bandits a few days ago, ordering them to pay 25,800 yuan. The village has not yet come up with a response.

<p>A Dispute Between an Uncle and Nephew Results in Death Zheng Meixian, a farmer from the Hebei area of the first bridge of the Xiannv Temple, in the county, had a dispute with his uncle, Naifu, a few days ago due to a certain incident. At first, they quarreled, and then they fought. After being persuaded by neighbors, the two parties agreed to go to the Deyuelou teahouse in Xianzhen to settle the matter. However, Naifu, still unwilling, secretly asked someone to report to the 4th Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, who sent the police to detain both the plaintiff and the defendant. Officer Dai of the bureau interrogated them and sentenced them to several days of detention for violating the police law. But one wave subsided, and another rose. Meixian's father, Nailian, believed that his cousin, Nailu, had instigated the quarrel and the arrest. So he led his wife and his 80-year-old mother to Nailu's house to make a fuss. The Public Security Sub-Bureau again summoned both parties to the case. The testimonies were very harsh. The bureau prepared a document and sent the police to escort them to the city and send them to the county court for punishment. Nailian's mother heard about the matter, and was worried that her son and grandson had been detained. At the same time, she was old and deaf. When she walked to the river near her home, she suddenly lost her footing, fell into the water, and drowned. Then Nailian's wife carried her mother-in-law's body to Nailu's house, saying that her mother-in-law had been secretly beaten to death by Nailu. Therefore, both parties filed a lawsuit with the court based on their reasons, requesting that the court handle it according to law.</p>

Zhang Jiashen and others, the town head of the second district of Zhendong Town, proposed at the eleventh district meeting that the county magistrate and the first district office be asked to implement the closure of Ayu Estuary. It was resolved to submit the proposal to the county for approval by the district office.</p>
<p>New Director of Finance Bureau Arrives in Chang The previous report mentioned that Fei Yuhong, the director of the county's finance bureau, and Hao Bingzhang, the director of the Gaoyou County bureau, would be transferred to each other. It is now known that the new director, Hao Bingzhang, arrived in Chang on the morning of the 7th by the Kunshan ferry. He will take over the office on the 8th and officially take office on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Details of the Suppression Following the Robbery of Oil Carts in Tianning On the morning of the 7th, bandits (mixed from Taibao, Ashu, Henan, and Haizhou gangs) who had fled to Taozhuang invaded Tianning Village (under the jurisdiction of Jiashan) and Youche Port (under the jurisdiction of Jiaxing) and engaged in looting. They confiscated the weapons of the Baoqu Corps. The telephone line from Tianning Village to Jiashan City was cut. After the incident, Jiaxing was informed by telegraph from Youche Port. The Jiahu Bandit Suppression Headquarters immediately telegraphed the Jiashan Security Team, the Xitang Water Police 8th Team, and the Pingyao Water Police 7th Team, to encircle them separately. The Xitang 8th Team and the Patrol Team went on the Zhi Guo warship. They encountered six or seventy bandit ships with more than 400 bandits in Jiangcun Xiaogang. They immediately attacked head-on. The bandits stubbornly resisted and fired machine guns. The warship fired its cannons for cover. The fierce battle lasted three hours. Fortunately, reinforcements arrived, and the bandits retreated to Xiamu Marsh and Fenhu Lake. Two bandits were killed, more than twenty were injured, and three guns were captured. Three members of the Patrol Team were injured. In the evening, the entire team returned to the 8th Team headquarters in Xitang, carrying the bodies of the bandits. It was rumored that they would be beheaded and displayed in the area where the incident occurred. When the bandits invaded the two towns, stray bullets flew, wounding eight or nine men and women, including Zhu Jinsheng. It was heard that when the Jiashan Ganya reinforcements arrived, the bandits had already retreated. The Shan Li and Shan Tian ferries were prepared for bandit suppression. The passengers were driven off, and it is difficult to restore the original state today. The county government will conduct an inspection this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Most of the Loans Secured Because the Zhejiang Provincial Government's treasury was depleted and urgently needed funds, it planned to borrow one million yuan for relief. After consulting with the leaders of the Hangzhou silver and money industries, the two industries worked together to contribute 500,000 yuan each. A contract was signed the other day, and the funds have been transferred to the provincial treasury for use. As for the deficit, it will be borrowed from Ningbo and other places. A telegram was sent to the Ningbo Municipal Government and the county governments of neighboring counties to borrow 250,000 yuan from the silver and money industries. To be cautious, the former director of the neighboring county's general donation bureau, Zhu Luzhong, was specially appointed as a liaison officer and rushed to Ningbo to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>The Gan Bandits Retreat to Shangrao River Estuary The Zhejiang Provincial Government received a telegram from Guangfeng Xingchang on the 7th, stating that the Zeng bandits who had been defeated before had come back. The situation was critical, and they requested that troops be dispatched to encircle and suppress them. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government immediately dispatched Zhao Junmai, the head of the training regiment, to Gan, splitting the forces to attack from different directions. One force attacked from the front, while another force took a roundabout route behind the bandits. The bandit forces were unable to hold out and retreated to the Shangrao River Estuary. Many weapons were seized, and many bandits were captured. The area around Changshan is now relatively peaceful.</p>

<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Requests Allocation of Funds for National Schools</h3>
<p>Will Submit a Proposal to the Executive Yuan Meeting to Raise Funds for One Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, funds for national schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places have been in arrears for many months. Even the funds for May of this year have not been fully allocated. Currently, the schools are preparing to start the semester and urgently need funds. The schools have been sending telegrams to the Ministry of Education to urge the allocation of funds for maintenance. The Ministry of Education has been unable to cope with this problem. It is now planning to propose at the Executive Yuan meeting that the Ministry of Finance investigate the outstanding funds for each school and quickly allocate funds for one month for relief. It is reported that Jiang Menglin, the Minister of Education, has prepared two proposals and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan to be placed on the agenda of the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion.

<h3>The Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society is Actively Being Prepared</h3>
<p>Members Register in Succession</p>
<p>Issue Half-Price Train Tickets</p>
<p>The Seventh Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society is scheduled to be held in Wuxi from September 20th. The progress of the preparations has been reported in this newspaper. The following are further details.</p>
<p>Members Continue to Register As of the 5th, the Preparatory Committee has received continued registration from members including Shao Yuanchong of the Examination Yuan, Dai Mingli of the Ministry of Finance, Chen Gongda of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Chen Zhenyi and Li Zhaohuan of the Ministry of Railways, and Chen Changtong of the Shanghai Bank of China, totaling 100 people, including 46 family members.</p>
<p>Distribute Train Tickets After receiving the replies from the registered members, the Preparatory Committee contacted the Railway Bureau for group half-price train tickets, which have been arranged. The tickets have been distributed to the members so that they can take the train to Wuxi to attend the meeting at that time.</p>
<p>Banquet Locations Finalized The Society has a total of 350 members. Although not all of them will be able to attend the annual meeting, the number of people coming to Wuxi, including family members, may not be small. There are no large banquet halls in Wuxi, so the Preparatory Committee was very hesitant. It has now been decided to use three locations: the County Chamber of Commerce Hall, the New World Hall, and the Mei Garden. The banquet dates have also been arranged. The first day is for the County Chamber of Commerce and other merchant groups, the second day is for the silver and money industry, the third day is for educational institutions, and the fourth day is for a return banquet for the Society. Pan Gengsheng, the newly appointed County Head of Wuxi and a member of the Society, also plans to host a banquet for the members, but the banquet dates have already been reserved, so it is quite difficult to arrange. It will probably only be possible to hold a joint banquet with other institutions and groups.</p>

<h3>Gifting the Belgian Government with Japanese Research Achievements</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School, located on Shangwen Road in this city, was previously ordered to select products for the Chinese Education Hall at the Belgian Centennial Independence Exhibition.

<h3>Wang Yunwu Dictionary Gains Popularity in Middle Schools</h3>

The content of the book encompasses encyclopedic knowledge and meets the latest needs. Its level is suitable for general application, especially for middle school students. Many middle schools near and far have adopted it as a standard reference book. Zheng Tonghe, the principal of a Shanghai middle school, praised it as "(the materials are well-chosen, the explanations are clear, and it is compiled and arranged according to the four-corner numeral indexing method, making it easy to check.

<h3>Recent Situation of Physical Education at Central University</h3>
<p>Appointing Shen Siliang as Director</p>
<p>A German Coach Has Already Arrived</p>
<p>The physical education department of Central University, with its perfect management, has always been trusted by the society. Since Mr. Wu Yunrui, the director of the department, resigned this semester, the department has lacked someone to preside over all affairs. Now, the semester has started for many days, and registration is about to be completed, but the department is still in a state of stagnation, so the students are very anxious. After thinking again and again, they still had no good plan. The student union of the department convened an emergency meeting of the entire department the day before yesterday and decided to invite Mr. Shen Siliang to be the new director, and appointed Gao Zhou Zhao and other five representatives to contact the school authorities. The Dean of the College expressed deep sympathy and has drafted a telegram to invite him.

<p>Robert Cup Preliminary Round</p>
<h3>China Straight Wins over Japan Three Times</h3>
<p>Lin and Qiu's Skills are Superb</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Tennis Robert Cup preliminary round, which has been postponed repeatedly, was finally held at the Chinese Tennis Court yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM thanks to good weather. Chinese tennis stars Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai interacted with Japanese representatives Okamoto and Matsunaga. After three to five rounds, the superiority of the two sides became clear. Soon, Lin and Qiu won with a clean sweep of three wins, which was heard in the field.</p>
<h3>Ten Minutes to Win a Set</h3>
<p>Lin and Qiu's victory was due to their high skills and was by no means a fluke. However, the first set was the most impressive of the three sets won. The six games of the set were almost entirely dominated by Lin and Qiu. The opponent could only run left and right according to the direction of their rackets. Lin and Qiu's attacking methods each had their own brilliant points, and this set was particularly colorful. In ten minutes, they defeated their opponents, resulting in a 6-0 victory in the first set. Nothing could be faster than this.</p>
<h3>Loose Formation in the Last Two Sets</h3>
<p>In the second and third sets, Lin and Qiu were more lenient and gave their opponents more room to move around. Therefore, the formation of the two sides was somewhat loose. In the first two games of the second set, Lin and Qiu's line was not solid, so Matsunaga made two counter-draws, creating an advantage, and the victory went to the Japanese. But after three to three, Lin and Qiu rallied and finally won the second set 6-3. The number of wins for Lin and Qiu in the third set was the same as in the second set, but the difference was that Lin and Qiu were at a 4-1 advantage, and the Japanese became very active, their sharpness was irresistible for a time, and soon the score became 5-3 (China took the lead). After this, although the Japanese wanted to speed up, Lin and Qiu resolutely added a vicious blow, adding one more game and completing the whole effort.</p>

<h3>A Word of Insight</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouyang</p>
<p>The way people view themselves often errs on the side of arrogance or humility. The reason for the emergence of arrogance and humility mostly lies in the presence of a comparative mind.</p>
<p>The more intelligent and wise a person is, the easier it is for them to commit evil. The more foolish and dull-witted a person is, the more difficult it is for them to achieve anything.</p>
<p>Whether life has a purpose or not is a philosophical question. But without a purpose, there is no meaning. And with a purpose, it is impossible to say what it is.</p>
<p>People often suffer from a sense of inadequacy. But under this concept, they can create or destroy careers, reach a state of high intelligence, and descend into a state of baseness.</p>
<p>Young people find the words of their parents, no matter how good or medicinal, difficult to hear. But they treat the words of their wives, no matter how trivial, as golden rules.</p>
<p>Do not blame others for your mistakes, thinking you have gained an advantage. Beware that others may blame you for their mistakes.</p>
<p>The great French writer Victor Hugo said, "The present world should not be called the world, but the pit of hatred." How painful his words are.</p>
<p>Things that are difficult to obtain are all excellent wishes. But when wishes are fulfilled, the heart becomes indifferent. All the non-thoughts of people should be viewed as fulfilled wishes, then the world will be full of good people.</p>
<p>Ordinary people cultivate themselves and find interest in their own realm of thought and joy in it. Conversely, the pleasure of mediocre people is always sought outside themselves, so they are often dissatisfied and in pain.</p>
<h3>In Remembrance of Teacher Zeng Nongran</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shanzi</p>
<p>After the national upheaval, Teacher Zeng Nongran took refuge on the sea, supporting himself by selling calligraphy and paintings alongside Teacher Li Mei'an of Linchuan, a figure known as 'Zeng Li' by the world. The passing of Teacher Mei deeply saddened him. As the world grew more chaotic and his desire to return home remained unfulfilled, he once painted a landscape on Buddha's Birthday, inscribing it with the words: "To wander where Yangzi [Yang Xiong] wandered, one grows old. To wander where Mozi wandered, one becomes a Buddha. The world is muddled; to whom shall I return? The mountains and rivers are vast; who is their master? My brush creates as it pleases, as if after the primeval chaos. I do this for self-amusement, not daring to seek recognition." From this, one can glimpse his solitary and independent spirit. Yet, his mind grew stronger with age. Seated at his desk, brush in hand, he never seemed to tire. During his brief rests, he would discuss calligraphy and painting with his disciples, critiquing poetry and prose. My eighth brother, Daqian, and I often visited, deepening our bond. This year, in the fifth month, as I approached my forty-ninth year, the Teacher gifted me a couplet: "Brothers in advanced years, like Wen Bozi; in poetry, calligraphy, and painting, like Su Changgong." While I am ashamed to be called exceeding my ability, I indeed see the earnest encouragement. I also saw the Teacher newly painted a fan for Old Man Wei Ruosou, inscribing it with the words: "One must reach a hundred years without the aura of old age; together, let us enjoy the six principles [of painting] like enjoying naturalness." He further wrote on another side: "The will commands the energy; therefore, it is the will that masters the energy of morning and evening. To seek ease in youth and indulge in idleness in adulthood is the aura of old age. Mr. Xi and Mr. A-ge are both seventy years old. Mr. A-ge still engages with the world through calligraphy and painting. Mr. Xi never ceases writing and painting, even in the height of summer; that is the aura of morning." On the painting, he added, "I wish to confirm this with Mr. A-ge." Wei Ruosou was from the same hometown and the same year as the Teacher and studied together. Ruosou was one day older, so the Teacher treated him as an elder brother. I said that the Teacher's aura of morning would last forever, reaching the longevity of a great catalpa tree. Unexpectedly, he fell slightly ill in the autumn and passed away. Four days before his passing, he still wrote a poem for Old Man Wu Jianqiu: "Since the Jue Stream flows, it always winds around the pavilion; the willows planted by hand have already formed a dike. After the catastrophe, there is still my humble cottage; how sad that I cannot return home year after year." According to this poem, it was inscribed on the 'Thinking of Home' painting, which was made for Ruosou. His soul still yearned for his homeland; this can be seen here. Jianweng was also the Teacher's old friend of thirty years. When the Teacher was ill, he moved his bed to the Teacher's house. One day, the Teacher suddenly became unhappy and said to Jianweng, "At seventy-three years old, in this troubled time, to have a friend like you, a cry over my coffin, what more could I regret in death?" His voice was sorrowful and resonant, his emotions profound. Therefore, Jianweng lamented the Teacher, saying, "What is life for? To witness this land filled with desolation. Now he is truly dead, yet there is still one who cries over his coffin." Alas! The Teacher's calligraphy and painting already fill the world. The Teacher's fame will surely flow to later generations. He returned in full age; though dead, he is still alive. The feeling of the mountain collapsing and the tree decaying cannot be dispelled from our hearts. In the autumn sun of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, I wish to recite this with all his disciples. (Jue Chou)</p>
<h3>Teacher Zeng's Remaining Works</h3>
<h3>Balsam of Xiangtan, Woody Variety</h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>"Nine colors of spring hues gather together, a splendid grace of Phoenix presence." This is a beautiful verse by Yan Shu praising the balsam flower. Balsam is an herbaceous plant, with stems about a foot high. It blooms in early autumn, displaying a dazzling array of colors. In the old days, women often picked them to dye their nails. This was also a charming pastime in boudoirs. Recently, a friend named Fang Zibaochu, a native of Xiangtan, described the balsam in his family's Fragrant Neighbor Cottage. It is more than ten feet tall, with deep red flowers, just like the herbaceous variety. The leaves are also similar to the usual kind. From early autumn to mid-winter, it blooms continuously for five months. The seeds are as hard as iron. When scattered elsewhere, they do not sprout. Therefore, there is no second such plant in Xiangzhong. Zibaochu's father, Suisheng, enjoyed planting flowers and trees in his leisure time and found pleasure in watering and weeding. One autumn day, the balsam was in full bloom. Suddenly, a storm arose, with lightning striking. One of the balsam's stems was cut off from the root. No attention was paid to it. The next day, a sprout grew from the stem, gradually growing taller and taller, amazingly transforming from a herb into a woody plant. Suisheng believed this to be a sign of good fortune. He built a Woody Balsam Pavilion beside it as a place for relaxing and enjoying himself. It has been more than ten years since then. It blooms once a year and has not yet withered.</p>
<h3>A Scene in a Trash Can</h3>
<p>— Zui Chisheng</p>
<p>The trash can, although a place for concealing filth, also contains a sense of mystery. Therefore, sometimes love letters are found, scraps of silk. Those who find them often feel that there is a special charm. But this is just the beginning of a heterosexual love affair. There are also those who have been through the battlefield of love, conceived unwanted pregnancies, and given birth to unofficial crystallized products. Unable to deal with them, they often wrap them in a cloth and secretly abandon them in the trash can. Some are still alive, others already dead. We can often see or hear about this strange phenomenon in the streets and alleys of civilized cities. As for asking who manufactured this, who abandoned it, it is impossible to pursue. So this trash can is simply a (mystery vault.) Who knows how many romances and tragedies it contains.</p>
<p>It is said that one afternoon, I was going to Nanshi for a consultation. While passing by a trash can near Wangjia Wharf, there was a crowd of people gathered around. Driven by curiosity, I joined the spectators. It turned out that there was a cloth bundle in the trash can, containing a (male) infant who had already died. It was padded with lime. The skin was rosy and the body was plump, different from ordinary children. The skull had been smashed, the brains splattered. The face was a bloody mess, a horrific sight. There is no doubt that this was an illegitimate child, killed and then abandoned. Among the onlookers, some were shaking their heads and sighing, others were cursing loudly. After seeing it, I also felt endless emotions. If this baby had been born into a wealthy family or a normal family without children, what joy it would have brought. And it would have been held with infinite hope. But it was born of an improper union. What is called (hatred wishes it dead) was carried out, and it was put to death. It is pitiful that, ignorant and unknowing, it suffered such cruel treatment, ending its short life, and no one cries injustice for it. This is truly the most unfair thing in the world. Therefore, from a legal perspective, it should be punished. Because it concerns human life, it also has value to investigate thoroughly. There is another aspect. I hope that local people, when an illegitimate child is born, bawling as it falls to the ground, surely someone will know. But there are also those who are suffocated at the time. It is appropriate to provide guidance or warnings beforehand. If nursing is inconvenient, instruct them to send it to an orphanage. Do not abandon it arbitrarily. The Health Bureau or the Women and Children Relief Association should best establish several regulations to ensure that the average illegitimate infant receives a measure of life protection. In the future, they can also gain a foothold in society. This is truly a matter of concern in the discussion of humanitarianism.</p>
<h3>A Record of Obsessive Devotion</h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>Zhao Zhong, a native of Wuxian, had handsome features and a love for literature and art, but was slow to speak, stammering when he tried to speak. One evening, when he was just over twenty years old, he was watching a play at the New Stage when he saw a woman in a box. Her hair was like dark clouds, her clothes were a honey-colored long skirt, and she wore a light red half-sleeved jacket. Her eyes were clear like autumn water. Zhao Zhong was amazed, thinking her a celestial being, and he gazed at her without shifting his eyes. When the curtain fell, Zhao Zhong rushed to the door to wait for her. He saw the woman leaving with a companion, and suddenly she smiled, her teeth like rows of shells, white and unmatched. Zhao Zhong felt as if his soul had left his body. The woman left the door, got into a car, and drove away. Zhao Zhong quickly hailed a streetcar to follow her. The woman arrived at her residence, entered the door, and closed it. Zhao Zhong then noted the number of the door and returned. The woman's surname was Zhang, her given name was Caiqin, and she was from Hangzhou. Her father was a wealthy merchant. At that time, she was studying at a certain girls' school. That evening, she had not seen Zhao Zhong at all. Her smile was due to her companion's joke about a comical part in the play. Therefore, she could not help but smile, for no other reason. From that day on, Zhao Zhong waited for her on his bicycle, but he never saw her. A doctor lived with the woman in her residence. Zhao Zhong pretended to be a patient seeking medical attention and went there many times, but he never caught a glimpse of her. After several months of this, Zhao Zhong's longing grew even stronger. However, Caiqin did not know anything about it. At that time, there was a great epidemic. Caiqin died and her coffin was placed in a temple. Zhao Zhong was often seen placing a bouquet of flowers in front of the coffin every day. Since the woman's death, Zhao Zhong had been depressed and unhappy. Within a month, he was coughing up blood and died. After his death, the two families gradually investigated the reason and felt sorry for Zhao Zhong's infatuation and grieved for his short-lived love. They then held a ghost marriage.</p>
<h3>Internal Politics of Post-War Poland (2)</h3>
<p>— Li Liuzeng, Sent from Paris</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the first step taken by the Provisional Government was to convene a constitutional assembly. However, even before the assembly was established, the Provisional Government had already issued a variety of orders. The most important of these included the recognition of an eight-hour workday, mandatory epidemic prevention laws, and compulsory education. In addition, there were clear regulations regarding labor supervision, labor unions, and the requisitioning of railways and other public works. After the constitutional assembly was established, the first laws passed included land reform, public health, and police system reforms. The aim of these legal measures was to establish a common set of laws and regulations to be followed throughout Poland. This was the first effort towards administrative unification after Poland's independence.</p>
<p>An important law passed unanimously throughout Poland was the Constitutional Act of March 17, 1921. This act constitutes the current constitution of the new Poland. It covers all issues, including the generation of legislative and political power, the provision of compulsory military service for all citizens, and the affirmation of religious freedom. In short, in a comprehensive manner, this act clearly stipulates the obligations of the people and their rights to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>However, the establishment of this act was not enough to eliminate the traces of more than a century of division in Poland. Since the last partition, Poland had been divided into three parts, with completely different administrative and legislative systems. The only thing that maintained the patriotic concept of Polish merchants was the Polish language used everywhere. This Poland, which had undergone prolonged analysis, also required a considerable period to achieve true and consistent unification. Even obvious matters.</p>
<p>Therefore, the legal systems of the previous era were still largely considered valid in both the administrative and judicial parts. This was a real situation forced by the environment, not what the legislators wanted. The legislators' goal was to make Poland a unified country implementing a local autonomy system, not a federal country in which each part governs itself.</p>
<p>The administrative outline of Poland is also specified in this constitution. The country is divided into sixteen provinces (Voierodie), and each province is further divided into towns (Starostie) and villages (Commune), etc. According to the principles of local decentralization and local autonomy, each district is assisted by a council elected by the people to execute administrative affairs with government officials.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (272)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Sheds Tears, Her Heart Breaks; Red Lotus Fades, a Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>People from Ningbo also have a spirit of adventure. So in the country, no matter which place opens a new port, it is the Ningbo people who first come to engage in business. Moreover, they are devoted to their hometown ties. Fellow villagers are always willing to promote their fellow villagers. Pulling up weeds, they are naturally gradually becoming a part of the domestic power. As the saying goes (those who endure the most bitterness, rise above others.) Ningbo people are very able to embrace these two sentences. It is said that the man that Cuiyun married was also one of the Ningbo merchants. Speaking of his background, it was also very humble. But he was able to constantly struggle with difficulties. He was also able to constantly seize his opportunities without losing them. Now he has actually made himself a compradore on a Yangtze River steamer. This person's surname is Zhang, his courtesy name is Yiqing. When he married Cuiyun, he was already over forty years old. Which young women would not want to marry a young man? Why would they like someone past middle age? At that time, Cuiyun was only about twenty years old. Comparing her age with Zhang Yiqing's age, Zhang Yiqing could well be her father. How could she willingly marry him? Cuiyun at that time was a free person, not someone else's wife for sale. But she was someone who had experienced the battlefield of love. The guests who walked around in her place were not without young people. Things in the world are often not perfect. Young people are mostly frivolous and impractical. Some do not have the property rights in their hands. Some secretly come out to play, hiding it from their parents. If she were to marry that kind of youth, there would be no good results in the future. And it is close to an adventurous nature. Those girls who are brave enough to take risks do not care if he is young or old. They temporarily plan for immediate enjoyment. One side takes the initiative to extract your money. By the time everyone is tired of enjoying themselves, the money has also been squeezed dry. You go your way, I go my way. Each to the east, not related to each other. There are also those who, as mentioned earlier, have long harbored the intention of taking a bath. But Cuiyun did not think this way. She always wanted to marry a reliable person and live in peace, without wanting to leave the mountain. But from among the many young guests, she secretly chose and chose, but she was never satisfied. There was one of them. She could be very satisfied with him. But she had a heart for him, but he did not have a heart for her. This cannot be forced on people. There was also another one. She also had a heart for him. He also had a heart for her. But he already had a wife. And his wife would never allow him to marry a concubine. If Cuiyun were to focus on that guest and must marry him, it could be secretly carried out. But she knew that there could be no good results. Not only would she harm herself, but she would also harm him. At that time, Zhang Yiqing took a fancy to her. How capable he was, how extensive his social life was. Because she saw other Ningbo people, they were always rigid. But he was so considerate and gentle to her.</p>

<p>Commercial News Finance</p>
<h3>The Gold Market Is Calm</h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Four Taels. Yesterday, the market for standard gold was still peaceful, with only fluctuations of one or two taels, but the price seemed weakly soft. The industry's mood was distracted, with different buying and selling strategies. Yuan and Yongyuan, Cheng Yongfu, Chang and others all bought in, while Yuanmao, Yongshun, Shunli and others sold out. The exchange rate seemed tight, with uneven bank receipts and payments. Although the previous market's large bar was down three-sixteenths, and the silver price was reduced by three-eighths, people's hearts were volatile and unmoved. This was because of rumors of turmoil in the Japanese cabinet. Therefore, the market opened lower, then revolved around sixty taels. In the afternoon, each company did not seek a bulk supply, but the result had turned into a relaxed image, to be outside of sixty-two taels.</p>
<p>Morning Opened Lower. The market opened at 561 taels and 7 qian in the morning for the October contract, which was down one tael, because the British and American silver markets had shrunk. The major players such as Yuanmao Yong tended to sell, so it was difficult to rise. The gross market had small fluctuations of over one tael, and then Yuda Jinan and other buying and selling were unabated, gradually moving down two taels. Recently, Ying Jin Hua Bi and others sold 7 pence 4375. When the prime rate was announced, it was about 59 taels, and the listed price did not change, at 58 taels and 6 qian. Then, because Fuchang and others bought in, and Makali absorbed British gold for December at 7 pence 6875, the market rose two taels. However, after 9:30, the sellers seemed strong, and the market retreated one tael. At 10:00, it was only 59 taels 34 qian. At this time, the near-term British gold could be settled at 7.5 pence. Later, the bank's appetite for British gold was still good, and it still absorbed 7 pence 6875 in December. The Bank of America did 39 yuan 4375 with the Central Bank in September, and the Central Bank occasionally paid in. The buying interest in the market Cheng Yong and others grew strong, and now it has jumped three taels, to 62 taels and 7 qian. After that, the market was in a revolving situation, with small retrospectives of one or two taels. Each company had a small number of inputs and outputs. After 11:00, the market had dragged to 61 taels, then pulled up one tael, to 62 taels 12 qian. When the market closed at noon, it fell back to 61 taels 2 qian, as the shorts suppressed small settlements, while Zhao Hu</p>
<p>The gold price was still 611 taels and 4 qian, the initial pressed price was 523 taels, then 489 taels, and 50 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Evening Market Was Extremely Calm. The afternoon market opened at 61 taels 3 qian, then 1 tael 7 qian. Then, because the Indian exchange rate was strong and the exchange rate was flat, the Korean Mitsui did 39.5 yuan with the American dollar in September, and Mitsui issued the Japanese gold in October at 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 125, so at 2:30 the market fell to 60 taels 3 qian, then slightly raised 1 tael. After 3:00, the Japanese bank sold slips, and suddenly broke the 60 tael mark, to 59 taels 67 qian. Before long, it secretly came out of the pass. Yuanmao Yong and others sold and then bought back, and people's hearts were very firm, suddenly jumping up two taels, until the market closed at 4:30, the market was at 62 taels 4 qian, then did a lot of money, buying in to hedge, compared to last Saturday, it was only reduced by 3 qian. The maximum price in one day was 62 taels 7 qian, and the minimum price was 58 taels 6 qian, a difference of 4 taels and 1 qian. The revealed price was suppressed by about 50 taels. The book entry for September was 72 taels, October was 61 taels, the water supplement was 72 taels, the afternoon was 73 taels, the physical goods in the morning market were 61 and a half taels, 61 taels 2 qian at noon, 1 tael and a half in the afternoon, and the market closed at 63 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions Were Scattered. Although the buying and selling of each company was not in large batches, it was still active. Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Fu Chang, Yong Kang, Yong Cheng Chang, Yong Heng and others all entered, while Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Yu Da, Sen Chang Yong and others had erratic ups and downs. Yuan Mao Yong, Bing Xing, Yuan Cheng, Jin An Tai Kang Run, Yuan Kang Xiang, Shun Li and others all sold. In the afternoon, Fu Chang, Wan Xing and retail investors all entered, while Shun Li, Heng Xing, Han Heng sold. Yuan Mao Yong, Da De Cheng, Yu Da and others had erratic ups and downs. The Dalian Gang sold 900 strips, and then entered more than 300 strips. The Guangdong Gang had a small number of transactions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Domestic Market Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates, except for Hong Kong, which decreased by 75, to 82 taels 75, there were no increases or decreases in the others. Although the overseas big strips shrunk, they did not move. The European market was mediocre, with only the Chinese side selling. As for the Shanghai foreign exchange domestic market, it seemed slightly loose, initially flat, then weakened, but then, because of the settlement of accounts by the tobacco company, it once stabilized. At noon, it returned to flat. The afternoon was in a peaceful state. The gold market was in turmoil throughout the day, with a curve of four taels, hovering around 560 taels. In the end, it was stable, and the closing prices of each exchange rate compared to the weekend were slightly longer for British gold, at 0625, American gold was longer at 125, and Japanese gold was neither glorious nor disgraced. Chinese merchants and speculators had slightly some deposits and withdrawals, with British gold sold by Shengda and other companies by tens of thousands of pounds, Li Hua Bi and Mitsui sold out, and Fu Chang and others sold to Makali Shanghai Yuli and others by 40,000 or 50,000 pounds. Banks transacted with each other by several tens of thousands of pounds. British American Tobacco purchased several million pounds, and American gold was done with each line by several tens of thousands of yuan. Chinese merchants also settled in Japanese exchange rates of several tens of thousands of yuan, which was sold by Mitsui.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Flat and Stagnant</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains flat and weak due to poor conditions. Factories have excessive inventory, and the Chaozhou merchants are determined to sell, increasing pressure. Japanese merchants are not very interested. However, actual sales are more active among Sichuan merchants, while other groups remain inactive.</p>
<p>Auction Efforts Lead to High Pressure:  Early Market Opening in Auction</p>
<p>Due to the downward trend in American cotton, there was a lack of buying interest in the market, causing prices to decline slightly. Each month saw declines of 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. In the afternoon, news of better actual sales among Sichuan merchants slightly boosted confidence.  Many speculated that American cotton would rise tomorrow, leading to steady buying in the second and third sessions. The market recovered at closing, ending similarly to the opening. The total volume for the day was 12,150 bales. Sales included 900 bales from Rui Da, 650 bales from Rong Xing, 700 bales from Da Feng, 650 bales from Yi Ji, 750 bales from Shen Xin, and 300 to 450 bales from Han Feng, Shen Chang, Li Chang, Yong Chang, Guang Feng, Heng Yi, and Da Chang Cheng. Purchases included 850 bales from Shen Ji, and 300 to 400 bales from He Shen, Tong Xing, Ji Feng, Yi Yu, Sen Kang, Fu He, Heng Chang, Xie Sheng, and Zhen Da. Closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Auction Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Inventory: Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Inventory</p>

<h3>Cotton Market in a State of Latent Instability</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then strengthened, although the trend for American cotton remained flat. However, most local observers shared a bullish outlook, estimating that American cotton production would likely decrease to below 14 million bales. Additionally, the arrival of a few sprinkles after the White Dew solar term was considered highly unfavorable for cotton plants, leading to increased buying. The market trend tightened as everyone expected prices to rise, with estimates predicting 14,008,000 bales. However, merchants from Hubei sold 14,500 dan in both the morning and afternoon sessions. According to a friend, the harvest in Hubei is good, but factories are still not inquiring about spot cotton. The market is expected to experience significant changes tomorrow.</p>
<p>Hubei Standard Softens: The Hubei standard market opened lower due to the further decline in American cotton prices, leading to weak sentiment and a drop of 2 qian. The second and third sessions saw a slight increase due to the abnormal weather conditions, hot and humid, with more buyers emerging, resulting in a slight rise. Prices then surged in the afternoon as American cotton was expected to rise, and light rain further bolstered prices, rising by 2 qian. Later, some selling led to a decline, ultimately resulting in a rise of 5 fen to 1 qian. Total transactions for the day amounted to 48,800 dan. Purchases included 3,200 dan from Heng De, 1,100 from Shen Ji, 1,100 from Yuan Tai, 1,400 from He Shen, 1,500 from Zhen Da, 1,700 dan from Da Chang Cheng, and 800-900 dan from others. Sales included 8,100 from Shen Chang, 3,600 dan from Yuan De, 1,800 bales from Chang Ji, and the rest ranging from 1,400 to 800-900 dan. The closing prices of the Hubei standard are listed below:</p>

<h3>Weekly British and Indian Cotton Industry News</h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week, transporters actively purchased spot cotton. Local factories only bought a few urgent necessities. Futures were flat. Business was significantly hampered due to the boycott of British merchants. Hopes for a peaceful movement have faded, and there is no prospect for a political resolution. News of cotton harvests from the United Provinces, Bengal, and Sindh is satisfactory. The Oomra region also saw progress this week. The attached statistics for the past week are as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1929 1930 Shipped to 10 4</p>

<p>Liverpool: Spot cotton inquiries were quite active last week, while futures were generally calm. Noteworthy aspects include large-scale hedging and selling by mainland merchants. Market conditions were uninspired due to the upcoming release of the US government's cotton report. The Egyptian cotton market also lacked excitement.</p>
<h3>The Food and Rice Market at Hexia Continues to Be Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the number of boats arriving at various wharves was around ten, further weakening sales. However, high-quality goods could still be maintained due to their scarcity. Therefore, the price of top-grade japonica rice only slightly declined, while medium- and lower-grade rice saw a further reduction of half a jiao, making it difficult to stabilize. Currently, rice priced around 20 yuan, with some change, is considered to be of upper-medium quality. Dongxin japonica rice is still quoted at 18 yuan, with sellers observing the market to avoid being undersold. However, if the weather continues to be sunny, prices are likely to fall. Top-grade "new guest sharp" goods are quoted at 14 yuan, but sources from various regions have decreased slightly, and prices have continued to weaken by two to one jiao compared to the previous day. White yuan rice arrivals and sales are both scarce, with no prosperity or decline in the market. The overall range is from 19 yuan to 18.5 yuan. The situation for new foreign indica rice is flat, with little price fluctuation.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Few boats arrived at Hexia, only a handful. Although purchases along this street were acceptable, due to the weakness of the Zhabei market and continuous sunny weather, sentiment was poor, leading to a continued softening of japonica rice prices. However, top-grade Northern japonica rice has been scarce for several markets, and warehouse stocks are also very low. Medium-grade japonica rice from Suzhou and Tongzhou also feels very dry, with prices barely recovering slightly. The shape of the market for South Shanghai thin early rice is stagnant, with source even feeling desolate, sales are also not smooth. So the surface of the market is with Zha Bei japonica rice and shift, daily trade is sparse, a general trend is flat and weak. Dongxin japonica rice arrivals are rare and the market is stable, with prices hovering between 18 yuan and 17.5 yuan. The supply of exchangeable goods is truly rare, with top-grade yuan rice requiring around 19 yuan.</p>
<h3>There are Tianjin Buyers for Guest Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Guest Indica rice continued to arrive from Jiangxi, with a small amount also arriving in Shanghai from Hunan. However, Hunan has officially lifted the ban, so there may be a large number arriving continuously. After the official lifting of the ban in Hunan Province, the passport fee decreased by one yuan compared to goods shipped last month. With reduced costs, traders are naturally more interested. Therefore, the Shanghai market is very stagnant, with prices declining slightly. For the whole day, merchants from Tianjin bought 1,000 bags of Hunan Broken Rice at a price of 11 yuan 7-8 jiao. Jiangxi rice is popular among merchants on this street and sells better, so the market is stable. It is estimated that 2,000 bags of early machine rice were sold at prices of 13 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen, 13 yuan, and 12 yuan 8 jiao, and 800 bags of late machine rice were sold at prices of 14 yuan 9 jiao, 14 yuan, and 13 yuan 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Re-enters a Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month presented another trend of gradual softening. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat rose by 4-5 jiao, actual sales were slackening. Tianjin merchants were still unable to ship exports, so the attitude of various factories was not as firm as before. Additionally, the pricing of foreign flour and wheat had become close. If the pricing of local flour was not lower than that of foreign flour, it would inevitably increase gradually. Therefore, although the factories did not sell off significantly, the future situation would ultimately be difficult to develop. As a result, this month was down by 2.5 li compared to last week, October was down by 1 fen, November was down by 5 li, December was down by 2.5 li, January was down by 2.5 li, and February was down by 5 li.</p>
<h3>The Futures Wheat Evening Market Sees Heavy Selling and a Sudden Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the prices for each month generally showed a hovering trend, with little increase or decrease compared to last week's closing price. However, after the opening in the afternoon, the market was initially stable. Then, a major player suddenly sold off a large quantity of distant months, such as December, January, and February, reaching 50-60 truckloads. According to general speculation, it was said to be the hedging of factories. Therefore, sentiment softened, and the market trend began to decline. Generally, the pricing of foreign wheat is approaching, so the focus of factories must change. As a result, this month was down by 3 fen compared to last week, November and December were down by 3 fen, and January and February were each down by 5 fen. In the spot wheat market, sources from the Guest route continued to arrive, but the purchasing interest of various factories remained unchanged. Given this type of firm rejection, the quoted prices for each grade must be revised downward in the future without a doubt. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of wheat from Tai'erzhuang, Shandong, and Yaowan were purchased by traders but have not yet been allocated to factories.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Japanese Sugar Arrives in Swarms, Weakening the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the report for the sugar market districts: There were no electricity reports for the current sugar from Cuba and the New York futures sugar. Java's Current Sugar price is 8.750, the future sugar for October is 8.50, and November is 8.375. This is each dropping back 125 than before. At the association marketplace, the trade for Dutch sugar No. 24 and raw white sugar still is scarce; for the moment they’re putting through the good of aged, at 8 liang. The cleanliness is white for the goods that pull thick at 8 liang 3 qian. The coming in and coming out is very lax. Transactions for medium white sand and such are also few, Dutch red, with the good arriving transferring in swarms, the market vigor is even weaker. Although there is no coming in and coming out, the shape of the market has already revealed a trend of decline, the Japanese sugar N mark is at 8 liang 1 qian 2.5 fen, YT mark is at 8 liang 0 qian 7.5 fen, YRO mark is at 7 liang 9 qian 7.5 fen, YP mark is at 8 liang 1 qian 7.5 fen each dipping back 2.5 fen, transactions are particularly withered. The actual matter is that selling is sluggish, at the Yangtze etc. the sales office of Taikoo sugar has even dropped the price half a qian. Therefore, the asking of the way is even more calm, and the Meiji sugar is continuously in transit to arrive, although the multiple families still think of tightening things, it already feels like the turning of the decadent style is difficult to avoid.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods New Quanzhou Soaked Round Comes on Stage for This Batch</h3>
<p>Quanzhou new soaked round goods, because the same profession has fixed a time for export, may not preempt one another. Thus they were delayed a couple of days arriving here at Shanghai and the figure has increased, a total of 3,000 plus boxes. Yesterday it has already been loaded aboard the Hua Heng ship and arrived, here at new same rounds goods have already dropped three surface values, as it happens to match the market fatigue it is difficult to hope for good selling.

<h3>Silk and Tea Shaoxing's New Autumn Cocoons are Already on the Market</h3>
<p>There is an 80% Harvest Overall ··· The Price of Improved Seed Cocoons Looks High</p>
<p>This year, farmers in the four rural areas of Shaoxing are raising autumn silkworms because the official authorities are selling improved seeds and silk cocoon merchants are promoting and advocating it. The amount of silkworms raised is not less than that of spring silkworms. From the acquisition of silkworm eggs to the third sleep and sufficient leaves, the silkworm season has been quite good and the climate has been harmonious. But until the big sleep and abundant leaves the weather suddenly changed, autumn rains came one after another. With the added coldness, the silkworm eggs developed, changing without sleeping or eating. They suffered great losses. The new silkworms from the four rural areas are now on the market. About 50% of the cocoon businesses are weighing the goods. The yield of cocoons is about 80% of a normal year. The price of cocoons is highest for the improved varieties, with a price of 60 yuan, while ordinary varieties are priced at 40 to 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Dong Goods Skyrocket Fiercely</h3>
<p>Locally-Made Cloth:  The market has seen little prosperity or decline in recent days, but sales are not as smooth as before. The main reason is that the price of Dong piece goods has recently skyrocketed, causing the focus of local merchants to shift, leading to a large decrease in sales. However, factory stocks are very low, so no decline has yet been seen. Yesterday, Ningbo merchants slightly traded 16-pound coarse cloth, with Wang Lao priced at 7 liang 1 qian 5 fen, Double Elephant at 7 liang, and Five Cranes at 7 liang 2 qian 5 fen. Fine cloth sales are stagnant due to dyeing and sales issues, and the Northern merchants are also inactive. Yesterday, there was a slight softening, with Blue Double Fish selling for 6 liang 9 qian 5 fen, Yang Crane for 6 liang 9 qian, and Hunter for 6 liang 8 qian. Fine twill is still firm, with strong demand from inland merchants. Yang Crane sold for 7 liang 2 qian 5 fen, Golden City for 7 liang 1 qian, and Blue Double Fish for 6 liang 8 qian 2 fen.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Yesterday, Eastern goods rose again, with an unstoppable momentum.

Other items, such as cotton flannel, moon velvet, red label twill, etc., also saw firmness. Besides the exceptionally active future street, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Sichuan, and other merchants also made large purchases yesterday. Observing the follow-up steps, there is a strong trend of continued growth and increase. Western goods also rose, but the future street was not significantly different.</p>
<h3>Hardware and Screws Local Merchants See Extremely Active Trading</h3>
<p>The screw business has been very lively recently, with transactions reaching as many as 600-700 barrels in recent days. Exports to the Yangtze River, inland rivers, and Fujian merchants have also seen some additions. Therefore, the vibrancy of negotiations in the market is almost comparable to that of Dong white iron. The current market price is 12 liang for 3-fen screws, 11 liang 5 qian for 4-fen screws, 11 liang for 5-fen screws, and 8 liang 7 qian 5 fen for 6-fen screws. Recent arrivals have been very few, and stocks are low, so the market outlook is optimistic.</p>

<h3>Today's Commemoration of the Premier's First Uprising</h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee Issues a Proclamation to the People</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the first uprising of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang. The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department has specifically scheduled a commemorative meeting to be held at 9:00 AM today at the Republican Grand Theater on Fangbang Bridge, Min'guo Road. All government agencies, party departments at all levels, and people's organizations are required to send four representatives to attend at that time. Yesterday, a proclamation to the people was also issued, saying:</p>
<h3>British Envoy Passes Through Shanghai to Beijing</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Beijing Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that the British Minister, Lampson, traveled to Beijing from Beidaihe aboard the gunboat HMS Scarab. He passed through Shanghai yesterday (the 7th), but only stopped briefly at the Wusongkou. After the British Consulate-General sent a small boat to deliver and receive correspondence, he immediately sailed west. It is expected that he will arrive in Beijing this afternoon. According to the British Consulate-General, Lampson's trip is only a routine visit to Beijing to meet and discuss official business and does not involve any special missions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Returned to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Waiting to Meet the British Envoy</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Tu Zhengting, who recently traveled to Hangzhou for sightseeing, returned to Shanghai by train at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Wang learned that the British Envoy Lampson had departed from Beidaihe on a British warship, heading south to Beijing. According to a telegram from Mr. Lampson en route, he is expected to arrive today. Mr. Wang then took the overnight express train back to Beijing last night to await a meeting with the British Envoy to negotiate the October 1st handover of Weihaiwei. Mr. Wang originally intended to host a grand tea dance at the Dahua Hotel today to welcome Mr. Roxas, the Vice Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, who is passing through Shanghai on the President Wilson, and personally receive him. However, due to the urgent need to meet with the British Envoy, he had to return to Beijing hastily. Mr. Wang entrusted Vice Foreign Minister Li Jinlun to chair today's tea party at Dahua. Mr. Li is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing this morning.</p>
<h3>Joint Defense of Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, and Fengxian Counties</h3>
<p>Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, and Fengxian counties are implementing joint defense. A meeting was held at the Fengxian County Government on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss the implementation. Shanghai County sent Ding Ji'en to attend. Yesterday, Mr. Ding returned to Shanghai and told a Guowen News Agency reporter that the joint defense meeting was convened by Fengxian County because the military situation at the front is currently busy, and the defense of the rear is of great importance. Moreover, bandits are cunning and choose to appear and disappear at the borders of neighboring areas, making it impossible for the suppression personnel to pursue and suppress them, limited by boundaries. By the time a document is issued for encirclement and capture, the bandits have long since fled. Therefore, Shen Qingchen, the magistrate of Fengxian County, wanted to overcome this difficulty and, based on the Wudan Wucheng joint defense plan, specifically convened a meeting of the Shanghai, Songjiang, and Nanhui counties to discuss joint defense. Once a bandit alarm is encountered, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries, all efforts will be made to suppress and capture them, so the bandits will have no room to breathe, and it will be even more difficult for them to take advantage of the border areas to hide. More than 20 people attended the meeting the day before yesterday, including Liu Zhao, a representative of the First Water Police District, Shen Qingchen of Fengxian, Ding Ji'en of Shanghai, Zhang Qianshou of Songjiang, and Cai Churen of Nanhui, with Shen Qingchen presiding. Since the plan's regulations had not yet been drafted, a preparatory meeting was first held, and a formal joint defense meeting will be held after everything is ready. The resolutions of the meeting included: (1) It was resolved to name the organization the "Shanghai, Songjiang, Nanhui, and Fengxian Counties Joint Defense Committee"; (2) It was resolved that the regulations would be drafted by Fengxian and then submitted to the formal meeting; (3) It was resolved to invite the party departments of each county to participate in the name of the preparatory committee; (4) It was resolved that the monthly expenses would be set at 120 yuan; (5) It was resolved to elect Shen Qingchen, the magistrate of Fengxian County, as the director of the preparatory committee.</p>
<h3>Changsha Market Peaceful, Telegraph</h3>
<p>Exchange Rates Normal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Hankou Chamber of Commerce to inquire whether the Changsha market was peaceful. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has now received a quick letter from the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce, stating: "We have received your telegram. After investigation, the Changsha market is peaceful, and exchange rates are normal. We are replying to your inquiry."</p>
<p>Chinese Yangtze Steamers</p>
<h3>Full Resumption of Operations from Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chinese Steamers on the Yangtze Return to Shanghai: The communist party of Xiang province, which had committed offenses, has recently been repelled by the Xiang army, and Changsha is now secure. There is no need for the central government to dispatch large numbers of troops to Hunan. Yesterday in Beijing, after the request of China Merchants, Sanbei and others, the Ministry of Communications issued a telegraphed reply at noon, approving the return of the Jianghua, Jiangxin, Jiangda and other ships to Shanghai, in order to restore navigation on the Yangtze River. The ships are permitted to arrive in Shanghai today, and will immediately fully resume service. Since the Yangtze River route has been suspended recently, just as the ban on the export of rice from Jiangxi and Hunan has been lifted and large quantities of rice are being transported to Shanghai, foreign steamers from Britain and Japan have taken the opportunity to compete for business. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau received news of the return of all its Yangtze River ships. Shen Zhongyi and Li Yunliang, the chiefs of the Business Department, immediately planned the resumption of navigation on the Yangtze River. It was resolved yesterday afternoon that the Bureau's Yangtze River ships would fully resume service from the 10th, with the Jiangjing opening the first ship, still running the regular 1-4-3-6 schedule. A notice was immediately issued to all passengers and freight forwarders that the Yangtze River passenger and freight services would resume as usual from today. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the branch offices in various ports ordering them to start soliciting cargo from the 10th.</p>
<p>Sanbei Will Also Operate Yangtze River Steamers: The Sanbei Company, due to the gradual increase in cargo for the Yangtze River, and in order to compete with foreign merchants, has specially added the ocean liners Hengshan and Longshan to the Yangtze River route to meet the needs of passengers and merchants. Now that the Xinning Xing steamer has been released and allowed to return, it is scheduled to be dispatched on the regular route from the 10th, while the Hongyuan and Hongheng steamers will be dispatched to the upper reaches, and the Wuxing steamer has not yet been released.</p>
<p>Chinese Steamers to be Escorted by Troops: Along the Yangtze River, in places such as Daye and Wuxue, there are frequent incidents of attacks. The China Merchants Bureau, in order to ensure the safety of the returning Yangtze River steamers, the safety of passengers, and peace of mind, has specially requested the Capital Garrison Command to dispatch armed military police to be stationed on the ships, at least four on each ship, and steel bulletproof plates have been installed outside the driver's room.</p>
<p>Difficulties for Steamers to Travel to Shashi: There are many bandits lurking in the vicinity of Shashi and Hao Xue in the upper Yangtze River, and merchant ships traveling to and from the area are often fired upon. The navies of Britain and Japan have each dispatched a warship to Shashi to protect the navigation of the steamers. The Japanese residents in the area have also been transported to Hankou by Japanese warships. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau received a telegram from the Kuailee steamer, stating that it had arrived in Hankou from Shashi and that the journey was still safe. Also, the Bureau's Yangtze River steamer Emei, which was returning to Shanghai from Yichang, suffered damage to the wing engine and other components on the left side of the ship when it was reversing while docking in Zhenjiang. It now needs to be towed to Shanghai for major repairs.</p>
<p>Inspectorate General of Customs</p>
<h3>Planning to Establish Customs Houses at Huludao and Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>Moylerh Visits and Inspects Two Ports</p>
<p>And Investigates and Improves Customs Affairs at Dalian Customs</p>
<p>Moylerh, the Inspector General of Customs, left Shanghai on the 1st of this month aboard the Customs cruiser Hai Hsin. There were various rumors about whether he was going to Hong Kong, Andong, or Dalian. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the Inspectorate General of Customs on Hede Road yesterday to inquire and met with an official. According to him, Moylerh is going to Huludao to inspect the port and prepare for the establishment of a customs house. He will also visit Dalian to investigate customs affairs because Dalian is a special zone, and the customs treatment for goods transported there is different from that of goods transported to Tianjin and other places. There is a tax on each item, and the inspection method is also different. This trip is to investigate and improve the situation. On his way back, Moylerh will also go to Weihaiwei to inspect and prepare for the establishment of a customs house after it is recovered on October 1st. As for going to Hong Kong to meet with the Governor to discuss the establishment of a customs house in Kowloon, there was a proposal for this before the new year, but Moylerh will probably not have time to go there for a while after returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Li Zhonggong Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Recent News on the Jinliyuan Case</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the Vice Minister of Communications who also serves as the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 7:00 AM yesterday. Cai Pei, the Director of Navigation Administration who is also the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, went to meet him. According to Mr. Li, he will take office at the Bureau within this week. General Manager Cai has already informed all departments to prepare for the handover procedures.</p>
<p>According to General Manager Cai, regarding the Jinliyuan Wharf case, lawyer Gao Shuo is in daily contact with the Father of the San De Tang. The San De Tang is currently waiting for a reply telegram from the Paris headquarters. Once the reply telegram arrives, the mediation will proceed immediately. If the mediation fails, arbitration will be conducted. Currently, the Bureau is not overly disputing the San De Tang's intention to take back a portion of the warehouses on the wharf, because even if they were leased, they were always subleased and there was no profit to be made. As for the entire wharf, the San De Tang has agreed to sell or renew the lease to the Bureau.</p>

They are scheduled to set sail on the 23rd of this month, first to Tokyo. It is reported that the Navy Ministry has contacted Lieutenant General Ban Ban of the Japanese Army regarding all admission procedures, and has appointed Li Shijia, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Navy Ministry, to escort the students to Japan when the time comes in order to arrange the details. Mr. Li is currently still in Beijing and will come to Shanghai around the 20th, and will set off for Japan together.</p>

<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce</p>
<h3>Correcting the Habit of Liquidating Shops</h3>
<p>Must Use the Name of Liquidation According to Law</p>
<p>Procedures Must Follow Legal Regulations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently stated that the bankruptcy of industrial and commercial enterprises often uses the name of liquidation to dispose of assets freely, disregarding the law, harming society, and having a significant impact. In fact, the law only provides for liquidation, not the name of liquidation, and the procedures are often non-compliant. Previously, the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association requested a general order to correct the situation, which has been approved. A general order will be issued to the whole country. In the future, if shops go bankrupt, they must comply with the Civil Code and the Company Law, change to liquidation, and handle matters according to law. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, after receiving the request from the Association, has also instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the industry associations and notify the industrial and commercial sectors to pay attention. The approval order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is recorded below: (Order No. 12484 of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce) The original submission was made by the Shanghai Certified Public Accountants Association, stating that recent liquidation cases are accustomed to customs, not fully legal, and have a huge impact on society. Please approve a general order to correct the name and authority. Upon review, regarding liquidation matters, when the general liquidation of the Civil Code is conducted, it should be handled in accordance with the law, and the terms liquidation and liquidator should be used to comply with the regulations. In addition to a general order, you are hereby notified. This is the approval order.</p>
<h3>Cease Issuing Rewards to Wounded Soldiers</h3>

<h3>Military Department Strictly Investigates the Private Transportation of Saltpeter and Sulfur</h3>
<p>The Shipping Association yesterday received a ban from the Ministry of Communications, forwarded by the Ministry of Military Administration, ordering all shipping companies to comply. The original letter stated: "The Ministry of Communications issued Order No. 2620, stating that saltpeter and sulfur are raw materials for the manufacture of military fire, and private transportation and trafficking have long been strictly prohibited. The application for merchant transportation should also be strictly limited. Now that the communist bandits in various provinces are taking the opportunity to commit crimes, the origin of these raw materials should be thoroughly investigated and strictly examined to prevent malpractices and curb the spread of unrest. In the future, when companies, factories, and businesses in various places purchase and transport saltpeter and sulfur and submit applications through your Ministry to apply for saltpeter and sulfur passports, in addition to verifying whether the statutory procedures are complied with, the purpose, type, and quantity should also be carefully reviewed and then forwarded for application. Those transported from commercial ports to the interior must be reviewed and forwarded by the local government or provide equivalent proof before being allowed to be transported. In addition to separate consultations, you are requested to investigate and handle the matter accordingly." Private transportation of saltpeter and sulfur has long been prohibited. In the future, when ships transport saltpeter and sulfur, they must verify whether there is a passport or equivalent proof before they can be transported. In addition to separate distribution, you are hereby ordered to have the Association inform all shipping companies to comply and report on the compliance situation. This is the order." The Association has urgently forwarded the letter and requests that you investigate and handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation Requests Resistance</p>
<h3>Case of Increased Immigration Tax in the Dutch Colony</h3>
<p>Under Negotiation</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China telegraphed the National Government, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on August 13, requesting negotiations with the Dutch government to cancel the resolution of the Dutch East Indies Colonial Council to increase the immigration tax for Far Eastern immigrants to 150 guilders. The various agencies have successively replied. The Document Bureau of the National Government forwarded the reply, stating: "(The direct reply is based on Letter No. 5178, stating that the Chairman has forwarded the telegram from the Overseas Chinese Federation, stating that the Dutch East Indies Colonial Council has resubmitted the old case and resolved to increase the entrance wharf tax for Far Eastern immigrants to 150 guilders from 1931. Please order a prompt protest and negotiation with the Dutch government and the Dutch East Indies government to cancel the case. The instruction was handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for handling, and a copy of the original document was sent for reference. This case was previously reported by overseas Chinese Lin Youren and others in April last year. The ministers and consuls general stationed in the Netherlands and Java were repeatedly instructed to investigate and negotiate separately. Subsequently, the ministers and consuls successively submitted reports, and the government stationed there replied that there was no increase in the immigration tax in the territory. The current telegram from the Overseas Chinese Federation is similar to the previous situation, and the Consul General stationed in Java has been instructed to verify and negotiate. In addition to waiting for a report for further review, we will first reply to you. I hope you will forward the matter for review.)" The Ministry of Industry and Commerce replied: "(I have received your telegram and have reported the situation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification and handling.)" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied: "(I have received your telegram and have telegraphed the Consul General stationed in Java to verify and negotiate.)" The enthusiastic overseas Chinese in the Dutch colony are also actively petitioning for the cancellation. In this way, the Dutch government should be able to take into account international relations and repeal the case by concentrating their efforts. It is heard that the Overseas Chinese Federation intends to telegraph the Ministry again to proceed early to seize the opportunity because 1931 is approaching.</p>

<h3>Important Documents of the Telephone Subscribers Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company's Chinese Subscribers Association, regarding the matter of recovering the telephone sovereignty of the concession, yesterday specially submitted a concrete plan to the Ministry of Transportation. The original text stated: "Submitting a request for the announcement of a concrete plan to actively recover the telephone sovereignty of the concession. The issue of recovering the telephone rights of the concession, despite repeated protests by our government and people, has been consistently shielded by the Shanghai Concession Municipal Council using unequal treaties. Relying on the power of the concession, it protects the illegal activities of the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, disregarding our national sovereignty and laws, as well as the interests of Chinese subscribers and shareholders. Our association has sent numerous letters and telegrams, engaging in peaceful struggle, hoping for the company's reflection and correction of its illegal behavior. However, the company has remained like a horse with a bit in its mouth, acting arbitrarily. Even after protests from our government, the foreign consul has only used a diplomatic note, citing unequal treaties as a pretext. Such tactics of encroachment not only deceive our people but also treat our government's sovereignty as a child's play. Alas, the spirit of the people is not dead. Who can bear this long-term humiliation by the powerful? Can the dignity of our national laws be repeatedly trifled with? The association believes that only by fundamentally recovering the concession can its ambition for encroachment be suppressed. This time, the company colluded with the Municipal Council, obtaining a 40-year patent without the approval of our government. If we do not fight this, what future troubles can we imagine? We request your ministry to quickly announce a concrete plan, actively recover the telephone sovereignty of the concession, and use effective means to first halt the illegal operations of this International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company. Our association pledges to be a strong supporter, persisting to the end. We urgently submit this petition and await your instructions. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Transportation, Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, Chinese Subscribers Association, September 5th."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association recently sent letters to all Chinese subscribers to hold formal elections. The letter stated: "(Dear Sir/Madam, regarding the matter of recovering the telephone rights of the concession, our association previously sent letters to all members seeking opinions and requesting the submission of a list of formal committee candidates. We trust you have insight. We have now continuously received over four thousand reply letters from members, which have been organized. The opinions collected all believe that the Municipal Council's abuse of power and the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company's illegal operations cannot be addressed without thorough and lasting resistance. The opinions of the subscribers can be summarized as follows: (1) Chinese subscribers unanimously reject and despise the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, which disregards our national sovereignty, and refuse to engage in business relations with it. (2) Request the Ministry of Transportation to establish a dedicated agency to handle telephone services in the Shanghai Special District. (3) Request the Ministry of Transportation to order the Shanghai North and South City Telephone Bureaus to first implement the recovery of telephone rights in the areas outside the concessions within the shortest possible time. (3) Request the National Government to order the Customs to ban the import of all telephone materials not approved by the government. Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations again and actively recover the Shanghai Concession to fundamentally resolve the issue. (5) Chinese employees serving in the company should rise up to support national rights and, when necessary, use serious and effective means to awaken it. Our association intends to proceed immediately based on the wishes of the members and, in order to permanently protect the interests of subscribers and continuously negotiate with the company, a permanent organization should be established to take special responsibility. Therefore, we are attaching a list of initial nominations. Please circle half of the names, a total of twenty-five people, and return it to our association immediately to facilitate progress and comply with the regulations. This is greatly appreciated. (Attached: List of fifty initial nominees) Li Zuyu, Wang Zhiwei, Tao Rongqin, Hua Xianzhong, Zhu Yinjiang, Cheng Zhusun, Jin Runxiang, Hu Yunqiu, Zhang Yichen, Wu Yunzhai, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Zhongyi, Chen Yiting, Zheng Yuxiu, Chen Tingrui, Ma Bingyuan, Wang Zhiqing, Pan Shoubai, Lin Kanghou, Shi Zhikun, Lin Xiuliang, Jiang Yiping, Ye Fukan, Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Jiujiu, Sheng Zhiren, Zhang Zhirang, Gu Jiuru, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiqing, Yuan Ludeng, Qin Runqing, Yang Jiaju, Zhang Gongquan, Huang Suchu, Dong Kang, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Zhang Tinghao, Shi Jinliang, Li Shuxiong, Liu Zhanen, Hong Shen, Qin Liankui, Rong Zongjing, Yang Yinzhi, Wu Damo, Yu Bingjian, Chen Wenzhao. From the above fifty names, please circle twenty-five names in red ink and return them to our association immediately. May 5th."</p>
<h3>Appeal of the Vendors in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Vendors Suddenly Unemployed</p>
<p>The Vendors Association Petitions the French Authorities for Relief</p>
<p>On the sidewalks of the French Concession's Minquan Road and Avenue du Roi Albert and other areas, there have always been vendor stalls. Recently, the French police, in view of the fact that a small number of vendors were not setting up stalls in accordance with the police regulations, and for the sake of facilitating traffic, strictly prohibited all vendors, regardless of size, from setting up any stalls. The vendors, fearing the loss of their livelihoods and impending death, unanimously requested the French Concession Vendors Association to find ways to maintain their livelihoods. Yesterday, the association submitted a petition to the French Concession authorities requesting relief. The original petition stated: "According to the more than one thousand vendor households of our association, and the hundred or so representatives, who reside on Minquan Road, Rue Min Tche Ni Yin, Avenue du Roi Albert, Avenue Foch, Avenue Petain, and Avenue Mareschal Joffre, and other areas under your jurisdiction, they declared that since each vendor household obtained a permit to set up a stall and conduct business in those areas, they have done so for many years. The location of their stalls has never obstructed traffic or the business of shops, and thus no accidents have occurred to date. However, recently, the French police, for unknown reasons, have suddenly expelled all vendors from the areas in question, a total of more than one thousand vendor households of all sizes, and prohibited them from setting up stalls. As a result, more than one thousand vendor households, with a total of seven thousand men, women, and children, are suddenly without food and are now crying out in hunger, on the verge of starvation. They have no avenue for appeal and can only implore our association to find ways to maintain their livelihoods and save their lives. In response, we have investigated and found that the stalls set up on the sidewalks of each road all have permits. Although there may be a small number of vendors whose stalls are too large and should be prohibited, the majority of stalls comply with the order. Now, all vendors in the areas in question are being prohibited indiscriminately, not only causing more than one thousand vendors to suddenly lose their jobs, but also causing their families, who depend entirely on their livelihoods, to starve. Moreover, the impact on local security is significant. Our association, in order to seek a livelihood for the vendors and to seek peace for the locality, proposes that vendors be allowed to set up stalls in places that do not affect local traffic. We should also set appropriate rules so that each vendor can abide by the order and engage in business with peace of mind. In this way, several members of a family can live at the same time, and the local security will also benefit. Now, we are submitting the various stall setting rules that our association has formulated on separate paper. We ask whether they are feasible, and we sincerely hope that you will examine them and approve them for the sake of public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the French Consul General in Shanghai, Gan; the Director of the French Municipal Council, Wei; and the Director of the French General Police Station, Fei. Shanghai French Concession Vendors Association, September 8th, year 19 of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Municipal Land Bureau</p>
<h3>Surveying Land in the Yinxiang District</h3>
<p>Twenty-three Baozheng and Nineteen Tu</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating: "Notice: The bureau is now beginning to survey the land of the Yinxiang District's twenty-three baozheng and nineteen tu. All property owners should pay attention to the following: (1) The dibao (local security) will distribute registration forms to the property owners. All property owners should fill them out truthfully within ten days of receiving the form and have the dibao collect them and submit them to the third surveying team of the bureau, or the property owners can submit them directly to the surveying team. (2) If the property owner's address is unknown, making it impossible to distribute the registration form, they can directly submit the form to the bureau or the third surveying team themselves. (3) If the property owner's title deeds are mortgaged and unavailable, making it impossible to fill in the title deed's household name and mu (unit of area), they should quickly copy them from the mortgagee and must not refuse. (4) When the land of each household is being surveyed, the property owner must, together with the dibao, clearly point out the boundaries to the investigator or surveyor, or delegate a representative to the site to point out the boundaries in advance. Otherwise, the bureau will only rely on the dibao's instructions, and the property owner will be responsible for any errors or disputes that may arise in the future. The above four items are related to the property owner's consolidation of property rights and should be given special attention. This notice."</p>

<p>Seven Labor Unions</p>
<h3>Declaration of Assistance to Workers of the Rihua Cotton Mill</h3>
<p>Shanghai Calligraphy, Paper, and Fan Workers Union, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Workers Union, Shanghai Sauce Industry Workers Union, Garment Workers Union, Shanghai South District Construction Workers Union, Yifeng Enamel Porcelain Workers Union, Shanghai West District Construction Workers Union, and other seven labor unions issued a declaration of assistance to workers of the Rihua Cotton Mill: "Unfortunately, the workers of Shanghai are living in hardship and difficulty every day, seeking a beast-of-burden, slave-like way of life in an environment heavily oppressed by capitalists. In particular, capitalist countries, relying on economic power, are building great production enterprises in our Chinese territory to destroy the future of our industries. Not only that, but they are also using cruel and inhumane methods to oppress workers who earn their own living by the sweat of their brow as much as possible. In the past, during the labor unrest of the French-owned water and electricity workers, the French capitalists refused to accept the workers' very low wages and reasonable demands, (omission) Although this dispute has been completely resolved, the situation on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession at that time is still constantly looming before the eyes of our city's workers. What a painful thing this is! Unfortunately, the workers of the Rihua Cotton Mill are also demanding that the factory improve their livelihood problems, but the capitalists of Japanese imperialism have refused to accept their demands, leading to unrest. Since the beginning of the unrest, the workers have relentlessly risked their lives in dozens of days of struggle against the Japanese capitalists. Although the party and government organs have tried their best to negotiate, the capitalists of Japanese imperialism have still ignored them. From this perspective, the unrest among the workers of the Rihua Cotton Mill, which is under the control of Japanese capitalists, will inevitably take a long time to resolve easily. If our city's workers do not provide full assistance at this time of crisis, when the nest is overturned and the eggs are broken, then the Rihua Cotton Mill workers will inevitably fail and bow their heads and weepingly surrender at the knees of the Japanese imperialist capitalists. We hope that all the workers in the city will unite and, on the one hand, assist the workers of the Rihua Cotton Mill, and on the other hand, urge the party and government organs to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibited by the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Steamer Tea Servers Extorting Gratuities</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau has investigated and confirmed that tea servers on the Shanghai-Ningbo steamers are extorting gratuities. A notice has been issued to strictly prohibit this. The Navigation Association has been notified and will forward the notice to the various shipping companies. The original letter stated, in brief: "Previously, we received an order from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which was based on an order from the Municipal Government approving a letter from the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, reporting that the Sixth District Party Department requested a strict prohibition on tea servers on the Shanghai-Ningbo routes extorting gratuities and other matters. It was resolved to handle the matter as requested, and the Municipal Government ordered the bureau to investigate and strictly prohibit this, and to report back for verification. We forwarded the order to the association, and the association inquired with your company and other parties, who replied with various details and submitted regulations, which the association forwarded to the general assembly for reporting. Now, we have received a document from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, No. 926, stating that all the submitted documents have been reviewed. After sending personnel to investigate, it was confirmed that the tea servers on the various steamers are indeed extorting tips and should be strictly punished. We are issuing three notices and request that you forward them to the various steamers for posting. We also request that you formulate uniform regulations for the management of tea servers and submit them for review and filing. This document is being retained. We are attaching three copies of the notice and forwarding them to you. We request that you acknowledge receipt and post them on your steamers operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. We also hope that you will formulate uniform regulations for the management of tea servers and send them to the association for review.</p>
<h3>The Two Railways Granted Rice Subsidies to Employees</h3>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration issued a notice to all employees yesterday stating: "Notice: We have received an order from the Administration stating: 'Order: In compliance with the matter, the workers' representatives of the Wusong Machine Factory previously submitted a request to increase the rent and rice subsidies. We reported the situation to the Ministry of Railways for verification. Subsequently, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways stating: "Received. It has been found that the salaries of the railway employees were already increased last year. However, because employees with salaries above 50 yuan and below 100 yuan did not receive a special salary increase, they are approved to receive a discretionary rent subsidy of 5 yuan. The employees of the railway are already enjoying preferential treatment. Now, the price of gold has risen sharply, and the railway's business is suffering losses. The workers should share the difficulties of the railway. However, since it is claimed that the workers' livelihoods are difficult, and this is indeed the case, and the railway's finances are exhausted, the workers' requests should be accommodated to some extent. Therefore, we will allow an increase in the rice subsidy. Please discuss the matter and submit it for approval." We sought the opinions of various parties and submitted the matter to the 14th Administration Meeting to discuss the method. Everyone believed that the finances of the two railways were exhausted, but the workers' livelihoods were also difficult. Therefore, in the absence of any other solution, we drafted a method for submission for approval. Now, we have received an instruction from the Ministry of Railways stating: "Received. We approve the first item of the proposed method for increasing the rice subsidy for employees. All employees with a monthly salary below 20 yuan will receive a rice subsidy of 1.5 yuan. Those with a salary above 30 yuan and below 50 yuan will receive a rice subsidy of 1 yuan. The Ministry has already made every effort to be considerate to the employees of the railway. During this time of military operations, tax revenue is scarce. All employees should share this understanding and serve honestly. If there are any further unreasonable demands, the Bureau is authorized to report the names of the individuals to the Ministry. In minor cases, they will be dismissed. In serious cases, they will be charged with sabotaging transportation. Please inform everyone of this order." We have issued a separate order. We also order that the department comply with this order and instruct all subordinates to comply with this notice." We hereby notify everyone to comply with this order and instruct all subordinates to comply with this notice.</p>
<h3>Recent Tragic Disaster in Ankang, Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Chinese Relief Society has received reports from Zhang Xiaoci, president of the Ankang Huayang Relief Association in the old Hanzhong Road of Shaanxi, and Xia Minghua, vice president, stating that Ankang has suffered from drought since the great drought of the Republic of China 14th year, followed by locust plagues. There has been drought every year, and nine out of ten households are empty. Harvests are meager, and people are displaced by famine. Bandits gather and cause trouble, and banditry and kidnapping are increasing day by day. Those who could provide relief in the past are now unable to save themselves. The disaster victims are now without a way out. In October of last year and March of this year, there were two attacks on the city, and the residents were reduced to ruins. Since May 7th, the city has been besieged again. The siege lasted two months until July 7th, when relief troops broke the siege. The economy was in panic, and food supplies were cut off. The price of a dou (unit of volume) of wheat was 12 yuan, and the price of a dou of rice was 24 yuan. Wheat flour was 0.3 yuan per jin (unit of weight). Prices were so expensive, and there was no place to buy them. People dug for mice and exchanged children and dissected bones. The suffering is unbearable. Our association took the opportunity to provide emergency relief and raised more than 2,500 yuan to distribute for relief. It was a drop in the bucket and did not help much. The old and weak fled, and thousands left the city every day, but they were unable to escape because of the thorny roads and were often robbed. There were more than 3,200 households affected. This year's wheat harvest was expected, but it was trampled and destroyed before it matured. Troops were stationed on all sides, and conscriptions and levies forced people to sell their daughters and children. It was impossible to provide for them. A survey of the disaster victims showed that there were approximately 46,500 people. Those who have not been surveyed cannot be counted. Compared with the great drought three years ago and the siege of the provincial capital in the 15th year, the suffering has increased several times. Please provide a large sum of money to relieve the suffering and save lives. We have already allocated 30,000 bottles of relief medicine, Jisheng Dan, to be shipped to Tianjin and then allocated to the various disaster areas for distribution to temporarily relieve the urgent needs. We hope that people of goodwill in the country will work together to save the situation in order to alleviate the catastrophe and invoke the harmony of heaven."</p>

<h3>A Big Gunfight With Thieves on Rue Sapey Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Detectives Hear of Robbery and Go to Arrest</p>
<p>Both Sides Exchange More Than Ten Shots</p>
<p>No One Was Injured</p>
<p>Three Robbers Were Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, six robbers suddenly arrived at the home of Cheng Luan, a Hunanese who had previously held an important position in the Northern military and political circles, at 308 Rue Sapey in the French Concession. On the pretext of asking questions, they rushed in through the back door. Each robber was armed with a pistol. Two robbers stood guard downstairs, tying up all the people in the house with hemp ropes and locking them in a room. The other four robbers went upstairs to rummage through boxes and chests, looting almost everything. They stole a gold watch worth 100 yuan, 30 yuan in banknotes, and 10 yuan in cash. The robbers, seeing that the loot was meager and not satisfying their desires, were preparing to loot again when the doorman at 1590, a nearby number, noticed and immediately ran out to inform the Chinese patrol officer on duty at post 358 at the intersection. The patrol officer immediately used a nearby telephone to urgently report to the Rue Lokawei station. Detective Barty, the leader of the robbery squad, happened to be at the station and immediately led Chinese and foreign detectives, including the police chief, Paul, the Chinese inspector, Kim Ku-lin, detective Li Yao-long, and the detective team, all fully armed, to the scene in cars. Detective Barty first ordered the front and back of the house at 308 to be surrounded. When he saw that the front and back doors were tightly closed, he sent a Chinese patrol officer to bravely climb over the wall to coordinate with the inside. The detectives rushed in together. At that time, the robbers knew that the detectives had gathered outside the door and desperately fled over the roofs toward the sun deck. The detectives saw this and drew their guns and fired, and the robbers also opened fire to resist arrest. The two sides exchanged more than ten shots, but no one was injured. The three robbers were captured on the spot, and three pistols were seized and taken to the station. After a preliminary interrogation by the police chief, the victim's 28-year-old daughter, Cheng Xihua, was ordered to appear and testify about the robbery. She said that her father was currently in the north and did not want to report any losses in order to avoid worrying her father and being targeted by the bandits. However, the police station believed that since such a case had occurred within the concession, it should be thoroughly investigated and should not be handled casually.</p>
<p>The Mitsui Sues Tongsheng Case</p>
<h3>The Problem of Promissory Note Customs</h3>
<p>Money Shops' Custom is Ten Days</p>
<p>Promissory Notes Should Be Verified Immediately Upon Receipt</p>
<p>Yesterday's Court Session Continued Interrogation</p>
<p>The Point of Contention Between the Two Parties Lies Here</p>
<p>Following the absconding of Ho Gengxing, the comprador of the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co., with misappropriated funds, the Tongsheng Money Shop, in which he held shares, immediately went bankrupt. However, Mitsui held Tongsheng Shop promissory notes worth 147,429 taels of silver, which Ho had used to pay for goods. Because the shop refused to honor these notes, Mitsui shareholders, including the Japanese Mitsui Yoshinosuke, hired lawyers Li Zuyu and Okamoto to sue Tongsheng's shareholders Yao Weiyong, Zhang Xingchu, Hong Cangting, Ho Gengxing, and the manager Zhang Chunlai, demanding full repayment and legal fees. The case has been repeatedly heard by the civil court president Ying Shi of the Special District Court and reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the hearing continued. Chen Tingrui, the lawyer for the defendants Yao Weiyong and others, raised objections to the phrase "Mitsui Yoshinosuke et al." in the plaintiff's statement. After a brief exchange with lawyer Li, Li presented the company's shareholder register as proof. Chen then presented his opinion on the defendants' reasons for defense, stating that the defendants' defense rested on two points: (1) that the plaintiff obtained the promissory notes in bad faith, as Zhang Chunlai's lawyer claimed that Ho Gengxing had threatened to withdraw his shares, leaving Zhang Chunlai no choice but to issue the notes. However, this does not constitute illegal extortion. (2) Assuming Ho did obtain the notes illegally, the plaintiff was a holder in good faith. Now that the defendant claims that the plaintiff was a holder in bad faith, the defendant must provide evidence to prove it. The defendant's reasons for claiming the plaintiff was a holder in bad faith are: (1) that it is customary in the money shop business for promissory notes to have a term of ten days, whereas the promissory notes in question have a term of thirty days; (2) that a foreign firm receiving promissory notes in payment for goods must only accept those issued by money shops that are members of the Money Shop Association, and Tongsheng was not a member; and (3) that upon receipt of a promissory note, the recipient should verify it with the issuing money shop, which the plaintiff failed to do. However, none of these three points is sufficient to counter the claim. Lawyer Chen argued that Li's statement had already entered the realm of debate, but that the hearing was still investigating the facts, and therefore requested that the judge allow the defendant to present the facts first, in accordance with the case procedure. The presiding judge agreed. Chen lawyer then stated that the 30-day term of the promissory notes was rarely seen, and that the dates on the notes had been altered. "My law firm represents four defendants in this case and requests that the complaint against my clients be dismissed, because my clients cannot be held responsible for the accusations. The promissory notes violate customary practice. My law firm has sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Money Shop Association for investigation. According to Article 20, Item A of the Money Shop Business Association rules, promissory notes do not have terms longer than ten days. Furthermore, Tongsheng is a non-member money shop, and the plaintiff should not have accepted the notes based on custom. Having accepted them, the plaintiff failed to investigate their origin in detail. Therefore, the plaintiff not only obtained them in bad faith, but also showed gross negligence. What warrants further investigation is that the plaintiff also admits that the promissory notes were issued through collusion between Ho Gengxing and Zhang Chunlai. Since there was such conduct, it should be invalid. Zhang Chunlai had no right to issue the notes, yet he acted beyond his authority. How can my clients be held responsible?" Subsequently, Zhang Chunlai's lawyer argued that the plaintiff was seeking a judgment ordering Zhang Chunlai to be jointly and severally liable for repayment, but Zhang only served as the shop's manager and is not legally liable for joint and several repayment, especially since he was forced to issue them by Ho, and so on. Lawyer Li briefly responded to the issue of Zhang's responsibility, but the court ordered that this point be addressed during the debate. Then, Hong Cangting's lawyer rose and stated that since Tongsheng was a partnership business, partnership assets should be liquidated first to satisfy the debts. Only if that is insufficient can a claim be made against the partners. Now, the plaintiff ignores the former and only focuses on the latter, which is not in accordance with the law, and so on. Finally, the court asked Ho Gengxing's representing lawyer Wang Youling for his opinion. The lawyer said that Ho had obtained the promissory notes from Tongsheng and transferred them to Mitsui, which was a fact, so Ho's position in the case was special. Other than this point, he would only answer questions if asked, as he was hesitant to speak for fear of showing favoritism. As for the court's question of whether Ho Gengxing had forced Zhang Chunlai to obtain the promissory notes, he had inquired with Ho Gengxing, who said that it was absolutely not the case, and so on. Lawyer Li then presented previous Tongsheng promissory notes that Ho Gengxing had given to the plaintiff, stating that the dates of redemption were all longer than ten days, so the defendant's claim that there was no such custom was not credible. The two sides debated until after noon, and the court adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>University Student Involved in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Qiu Ruiqu Sues Fellow Villager Qiu Tiansong</p>
<p>For Repeatedly Insulting and Threatening Him in Writing</p>
<p>The Judge Urged the Defendant to Apologize and Reconcile</p>
<p>Qiu Ruiqu, a student in the Law School of Soochow University and a native of Fujian, has recently been subjected to insults and defamation by Qiu Tiansong (a student at Jinan University in Zhenru and an athlete), who is from the same village and shares the same surname but not the same lineage. Qiu Ruiqu was deeply resentful and hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to draft a complaint to the criminal court of the District Court, stating that the defendant Qiu Tiansong had fabricated malicious libel and threatened his life, and requesting that he be immediately arrested and severely punished to alleviate the urgent situation. The plaintiff is currently studying at the Law School of Soochow University in this city, and has always cultivated virtue and studied diligently, and has always been modest in his interactions with friends, with no prior conflicts. Unexpectedly, Qiu Tiansong, a native of the same village, has a fierce appearance and a vicious nature, and has fabricated facts, falsely claiming that the plaintiff is a lowly rabbit (i.e., a male prostitute). At first, he verbally insulted him, then he defamed him in letters, and finally, to facilitate publicity, he used postal postcards in succession, sending them like snowflakes. The postcards were clearly addressed to "Qiu Ruiqu, Rabbit (recipient)," and were filled with vulgar and obscene language that was unbearable to read, even threatening his life and intimidating him at will. One letter contained seven instances of "I will kill you" and "If I don't carry out my words, I'm not human," etc., which shows the defendant's malicious intentions and firm resolve. (Evidence includes seven letters from the defendant, before and after.) A letter of warning was sent through a lawyer and the defendant was turned over to the police station, but to no avail. In order to avoid danger, the plaintiff temporarily resided in Jiading during the summer vacation, but the defendant was well-informed and sent threatening letters again. In this situation, the defendant will not rest until he has killed the plaintiff. Furthermore, since the plaintiff was defamed by the defendant, he has been despised by teachers and friends on the one hand, and condemned by his family on the other, and has been deprived of his right to study. In fact, his reputation has been completely lost in school, at home, and in society, and his personality has been swept away. The damage is beyond words. Even if the plaintiff is lucky enough not to be killed by the defendant, what good is it to live shamelessly? The defendant's actions constitute the crimes of Article 319 and Article 325, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. In addition to seeking compensation for losses, the plaintiff hereby files a lawsuit in accordance with Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requesting that the defendant be arrested and punished according to law, and that the entire judgment be published in the newspaper to warn against unlawful behavior, etc. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Judge Deng specially opened the Third Tribunal for the trial. First, the plaintiff Qiu Ruiqu testified that he was 25 years old, a native of Fujian, and currently a third-year student at the Law School of Soochow University. He is now being harmed by the defendant's interference with his freedom and defamation of his reputation, and demands severe punishment according to the law. (Question) Have you and the defendant always been on good terms? (Answer) We are from the same village and studying together, and there is no ill will between us. (Question) There must be some reason why he wrote you insulting letters. (Answer) He was ill and asked me to go to the doctor with him, but I refused, perhaps because he harbored resentment. Also, the Fujian school sent a reward of 400 yuan to the plaintiff, which was sent to the defendant to be forwarded to the plaintiff, but the defendant did not hand over the money. The plaintiff asked him to return the money, and the defendant said that the money had been returned to Fujian. The judge, upon hearing the testimony, instructed the plaintiff: "You are both university students, and very respectable. Even if you insist on having the defendant criminally punished, it will not be good for you. Moreover, you are both from the same village, and it would be best if he could repent and not be too demanding." The plaintiff listened and said, "Yes, yes." The judge ordered the defendant Qiu Tiansong to be brought before the court. (Question) Did you write these seven letters? (Answer) Yes. The judge said: "You have committed two crimes, one of intimidation and the other of defamation. According to the law, you should be severely punished. It is best to apologize and reconcile now." The judge asked the plaintiff's lawyer if he had any opinions. Lawyer Ma stood up and said: "Both the plaintiff and the defendant in this case are university students, and this lawyer is also willing to reconcile, but there are three conditions: (1) publish an apology in the newspaper; (2) do not harass or intimidate him in the future; and (3) the money sent from Fujian (400 yuan) should be handed over by the defendant in full," etc. The judge then said to the defendant: "You have three days to reconcile at Lawyer Ma's office. If the reconciliation fails, then another hearing will be scheduled and a judgment will be made according to law." The defendant complied with the order and then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zhu Ruchao Commits Suicide and Dies From Severe Wounds</h3>
<p>The Special District Court Verified It Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the arrival in Shanghai of a large sum of money sent by the Zhejiang Local Bank in Hangzhou, it was stolen for 100,000 yuan. The police have arrested a number of robbers. Zhu Ruchao, the bank's cashier among those escorting the money, had to appear in court to testify during the trial, so he stayed at the Donglai Bank. Suddenly, the day before yesterday, he committed suicide with a knife without telling anyone. The incident was reported in this newspaper, as he had been sent to the hospital for treatment. However, Zhu's injuries were fatal, and the doctors were unable to help him. He died in the hospital at midnight that evening. Upon receiving the report, the police ordered detectives to take the body to the Philand Road mortuary for verification. Donglai Bank also telegraphed Zhu Xiong San, the son of the deceased, in Hangzhou to come to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Xu to go to the mortuary to verify that he had indeed died by suicide. After a brief inquiry, he ordered Zhu Xiong San to claim the body for coffin and burial. It is said that Zhu, in addition to asking the bank for compensation, also requested a position so as to provide for the family's livelihood. The bank has agreed to provide generous compensation, but a decision has not yet been made on whether to provide a position in the bank.</p>
<h3>The Cai Yunhai Case Awaits Investigation Before Further Review</h3>
<p>Cai Yunhai, a native of Guangdong, established the Cai Chen Company at the intersection of Beijing Road and Museum Road, specializing in import and export. However, those who ordered goods from him repeatedly failed to deliver the goods as scheduled after receiving the deposit and signing the contract. He has already been sued twice. This time, Guo, who ordered goods from him, sued him to the Special District Court. After investigation, it was found that he had breached the contract and failed to return the money, so he was ordered to be detained in the civil detention center. Unexpectedly, late on the night of the third of this month, Cai took advantage of a slight lapse by the guards and damaged one of the iron bars on the window of the detention center and escaped. The next day, Chinese and Western newspapers reported the incident in detail. After escaping, Cai saw the news that the court had informed the police to investigate and arrest him as soon as possible. Realizing that it would be difficult to escape the law, he hired a lawyer and surrendered himself to the Procuratorate of the Special District Court. The prosecutor specially opened an investigation court on the afternoon of the sixth, and Xie, the director of the detention center, sent Chen Jingcheng, a Shaoxing native who guarded Cai's room, to the Procuratorate for investigation. Originally, Cai wanted to be detained, but his lawyer repeatedly requested bail, so Cai was allowed to be released on bail of 500 yuan pending trial. Now that Cai has been brought to justice, the police filed a public prosecution yesterday morning, listing Cai as the first defendant, and Chen Jingcheng and Su Yunshan as the second and third defendants. Su and Chen were both guards at the detention center, so they were jointly accused. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the case file and learned that Cai and Chen were both under investigation in the Procuratorate. In the future, if the investigation is completed and the crime is established, the Procuratorate will definitely file a public prosecution. If the police file a lawsuit now, it seems redundant, so he ordered the three defendants, Cai Yunhai, etc., to be sent to the Procuratorate for review.</p>
<h3>The Yu Mingrui Case</h3>
<p>The Extortion Gang Was Interrogated Yesterday</p>
<p>The Gang Claims Yu's Uncle and Nephew Are Related</p>
<p>Yu Mingrui, a cotton yarn merchant, lives in the French Concession and is quite wealthy, which has attracted the attention of gangsters. Since this spring, he has been repeatedly threatened by extortionists. Zhang Ruigen alone has sent several extortion letters, five in total, but he is still insatiable. At 7:00 p.m. the night before last, he asked Yu to go to the Unity Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to pay the extorted money. Yu reported it to the Criminal Investigation Department of the General Police Headquarters, which dispatched detectives Pang Ruiqing and others. Yu also sent someone to the room, and just as he was negotiating with Zhang in the room, Detective Pang burst into the room and arrested Zhang. Wang Yaokun and Hua Haoquan were arrested outside the room and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu interrogated them. First, Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, presented the indictment, presenting five letters and a receipt issued by the gang as evidence. Zhang did not deny anything and confessed everything, saying that of the five letters he sent to Yu, two were written by Yu's nephew Yu Xizhang, and the other three were written by him personally. As for the 200 yuan Yu sent, he only received 170 yuan after paying 30 yuan to the person who delivered the money. The 50 yuan from another time was entirely used by Yu's uncle, and so on. The court interrogated the two defendants Wang and Hua, who both claimed that they were arrested because they went to the hotel to visit friends and did not know Zhang. Zhang also insisted that Wang and Hua were not accomplices and that he had never met them before and could not falsely accuse them. Judge Wu then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3>Report of Bureau Chief's Kidnapping is False</h3>
<p>For the past two days, alarming and unfounded rumors have suddenly emerged in the Chinese areas of Nanshi, all claiming that a certain bureau chief who held an important position in public security in this city was kidnapped on his way home. The rumors spread through the streets and alleys, causing fear and suspicion among women and children. Upon hearing of this news, the reporter knew that villains were spreading rumors to create chaos and disrupt people's hearts. Out of caution, the reporter personally visited the bureau yesterday afternoon. At the time, the bureau chief was meeting with guests, so the reporter waited in the reception room. The reporter personally saw the bureau chief chatting happily with two guests, his expression vibrant and his voice loud. The reporter pondered for a long time, originally intending to meet with the bureau chief and inform him of the situation, but feared that the bureau chief would be displeased upon hearing the news, so he left without saying goodbye. However, the reporter suspects that the rumors originated from the recent martial law imposed for the 9/7 anniversary. However, if the rumors are ignored, they will spread and confuse people's hearts and cause misunderstandings. Therefore, this article is written to refute them.</p>

Preparations have already begun, and the branch office will be established as soon as the construction of the house is completed at the end of this month. The existing postal branch office in the Triangle Field of the town will not be canceled for the time being.</p>
<p>Wusong Water Police Captain</p>
<h3>Honored For Rescuing Abducted Victims From Danger</h3>
<p>Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th Team of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Provincial Public Security Team, personally commanded the entire team of patrol boats on a flat-bottomed warship at the end of last month, heading to the Da'an Port waters at the junction of Nantong and Haimen counties outside the mouth of Wusong to suppress pirates. They intercepted a pig boat that had been robbed by pirates and rescued three abducted victims from danger. The details were reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the rescued victims Liu Fubao, Sun Yuanji, and Zhu Zugen, etc., believe that Captain Gong has made every effort to protect shipping merchants with his strict supervision of the team, and that he has personally braved gunfire and risked his life to rescue them from the pirate den, preserving their lives. They were extremely grateful and specially made a silver shield with the words "Universal Love and Support" inscribed on it. In addition, the intercepted pig boat belonged to pig merchants at the Taixing County port, and the port chief Wang Yucheng and others also presented a large silver shield with the words "Manifest Distant Expedition". Both were sent to the 17th Team headquarters with a band of musicians at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday to express their gratitude.</p>
<h3>Record of the Chinese Team Banquet of the Merchant Corps</h3>
<p>Celebrating the Award of the Shield</p>
<p>The Chinese team of the Shanghai International Merchant Corps celebrated its recent victory in the All-Corps Proficiency Shield competition with a banquet at the Duyichu restaurant last night. Most of the team members arrived with their families at 7:00 p.m. that afternoon, creating a lively scene with flowing skirts, clattering shoes, fragrant clothing, and gleaming hairpins. The team leader Wang Yanjing delivered a speech, followed by a speech from Hu Yunqiu, the Chinese advisor to the Corps, and a welcoming speech from the deputy team leader Chen Shixia, accompanied by the entertainment of a makeshift stage performance and a spirit group. The registered speeches of each person are recorded below.</p>
<p>Team Leader Wang's Speech: "The Chinese team has been established for 25 years. During these 25 years, it has undergone the arduous management and spiritual struggle of both old and new comrades, resulting in today's glory. Remembering the source of the water we drink, the reason why our Chinese team is valued by society and praised by both Chinese and Westerners is due to the tireless efforts and hard work of old and new comrades. The combination of a group must first be inspired by spirit. With sufficient spirit, there will be a strong combination and considerable achievements. The Chinese team is a security corps for merchants and civilians, and also an armed corps with a complete army system. In terms of military appearance, discipline, and cooperative spirit, it is especially important to be organized and complete. Obedience to all orders is a matter of course. Since we have taken the protection of merchants and civilians as our duty, we should serve the society. Therefore, apart from defending and protecting, there is no such thing as being responsible. Comrades, strive to continue your efforts and move forward. Finally, the award of this shield is due to the efforts of all comrades, so there will be a third victory, and we hope for a fourth, a fifth, and so on without end."</p>
<p>Advisor Hu's Speech: "It has been six years since the Proficiency Shield left the Chinese team. Since 1922, our team has won this shield. In 1923, we continued to win it. In 1924, the Chinese team should have won it again, but the headquarters cancelled the national encampment training due to a lack of classes, so it was cancelled in name only. Afterwards, other teams won it several times. Now, we have won first place over all the corps, winning it for the third time. Is this not due to the efforts of all of you? Because you have always been united and worked together, you have achieved such good results. As the saying goes, 'Where there is a will, there is a way.' What is especially commendable is that the members of our team are all merchants and civilians by nature, and we have always gone our own way without being tainted by political colors. Because of this, the Chinese team has been bright and shining, standing firm for 25 years as if it were just one day. I have seen other corps collapse because they were involved in political change, and some have borrowed the weight of politics to increase their own position, only to fall into a slump. As for the relationship between the merchant corps and the international community, I have never recklessly talked about politics with Westerners. If I were to talk about it, it would involve our country's politics and only invite ridicule. The fact that the politics of China are bad is not only ridiculed by foreigners, but also a disgrace to the nation. But Westerners often say that while Chinese politics are indeed bad, the Chinese team run by merchants stands out and is a model for civil corps and a credit to the international community. This is not me praising the Chinese team, but rather speaking from the perspective of Westerners. Alas, since we cannot obtain adequate protection from the government, we must gain our own strength to defend ourselves. Therefore, I have always believed that to defend ourselves, we must promote civil corps. While the Chinese team may not be said to be the first advocate of a model civil corps, it may be said to have the characteristics of a general organization, judging from its past performance. Furthermore, in terms of the current trend, it is necessary to promote sports. While good politics are like those of European and American countries, they still promote sports, and some have even raised their international status through their sporting achievements. Therefore, if our country wants to increase its international status, it has no choice but to promote sports. Our team uses shooting as a sport, and shooting is indeed superior to ball sports. It is a pity that we often do not pay attention to shooting. We know that shooting is a foreign sport. If we do not do it, then how could we have obtained today's silver shield? Now that we have obtained it, we want to keep it permanently in our team and not let it be taken away by other teams. But why did this shield that was taken from our team by other teams get taken back to our team, all of you should know that the other teams have more people with a heart to rely on others and fewer people with a sense of responsibility. There are many cases of failure due to a heavy heart to rely on others. Reflecting on our own team members, if there is anyone with a heart to rely on others, they should use the other teams as a lesson. You must also ask yourselves whether I have contributed to the success of this shield. If you feel ashamed, you must encourage yourselves to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. I also hope that your wives will encourage you to do so. Finally, I am very happy to see the event flourishing and should take a drink to congratulate you and wish the Chinese team unlimited future achievements." Upon finishing his speech, everyone applauded in unison.</p>
<p>Deputy Team Leader Chen's Welcoming Speech: "Our team has won the All-Corps Proficiency Shield and is hosting a banquet to celebrate and welcome the reappointment of Team Leader Wang. I am extremely delighted and honored. The speeches of Team Leader Wang and Advisor Hu were like setting off firecrackers, and after the firecrackers, comes my small firecracker. But as for me, I have immense happiness and a warm welcome for the reappointment of Team Leader Wang, but in terms of welcome, there are many different points. For example, the society's welcome to the officials taking office, the chief of the bureau, the president taking over, etc., this kind of welcome does not go beyond the routine, following the trend, vanity, flattery and so on. Today, my welcome to Team Leader Wang has none of the above-mentioned qualities, but there is a deeper expression, because all of us are united for the sake of peace in society, there is no involvement of rights, and there is no existence of vanity. We are not afraid of sacrificing our lives, fighting spiritually, and losing material money. There is no need to calculate because of this, and today we welcome Team Leader Wang, which is not the same as various welcomes in society, and has the utmost sincerity of the unanimous welcome of the whole team. As for the Proficiency Shield, a while ago Mr. Hu has described it in detail. I will not repeat it. It is not easy to get this shield, so we must take care to keep it, so that it can stay with our team every year and there can be today's celebration every year. This is what I deeply hope from all of you." Finally, Hao Boyang, the shooting leader, led everyone in shouting, "Long live the Chinese team, long live all comrades, long live the proficiency shield," and wished Mr. Xu Tonggu, who had worked hard and made great contributions in founding the Chinese team, a long life. For a time, cheers roared and everyone was joyful. It was truly a grand occasion. It wasn't until about 11:00 that everyone dispersed, having enjoyed themselves to the fullest.</p>
<h3>Two Sailing Boats Collide at Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>Salt Boat Sinks</p>
<p>Sand Boat Damaged</p>
<p>Liu Shenglai, a fisherman from Daishan, loaded hundreds of bags of official salt at the Daishan factory to bring to Shanghai. On the early morning of the day before yesterday, he sailed to the Sanxia waters off the Wusong estuary when suddenly a large sand boat loaded with sand and mud sailed in from the outer ocean. Due to the slight fog, the two sides were unable to avoid each other, resulting in a collision. With a loud bang, the fishing boat was damaged in the middle and gradually sank. All the official salt loaded on board was soaked by the tide, causing great loss. He quickly sailed the boat close to the beach, unloaded the remaining salt, and hired another boat to transport it to Shanghai for delivery. The bow of the sand boat was also damaged, but not seriously, so it was still able to sail.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Electrocuted and Died</h3>
<p>Huang Rongsheng, an apprentice at the Gaodeji board box shop on Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, was a native of Jiangwan and about 15 or 16 years old. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the China Tea Company at No. 141 Zhapu Road, Tiantong Road, to nail tea boxes. After lunch, he went to the toilet upstairs to defecate at about 1:00 p.m. It was raining heavily. After defecating, he tried to flush the toilet, but accidentally touched an electric wire and immediately fell to the ground and died. Later, someone noticed and called the police to the scene. The body was sent to Tongren Hospital and transferred to the mortuary for verification.</p>
<h3>Was the Woman's Death Due to a Buttock Injury?</h3>
<p>Aftermath of a Verbal Dispute</p>
<p>Request to the Court for an Autopsy</p>
<p>Zhang Yingkui, a farmer from Zhangjiazhai in the Yangjing district of Pudong, had a verbal quarrel with Wang Huangshi, the wife of his neighbor Wang Nengxin, on April 29th of this year (lunar calendar), over a minor matter. Ms. Wang was pushed down by Zhang, and unfortunately, there was a farming rake on the ground. When she fell, her buttock landed on the rake, causing a wound. The police were notified, and Zhang was taken into custody by the local court. The court sentenced Zhang to 30 days of detention for negligent injury, but considering the circumstances, the sentence was suspended for two years, and he was released on bail. More than three months have passed since then, but Ms. Wang Huangshi's buttock wound has not healed. Therefore, Wang Nengxin hired a lawyer to sue in court, seeking compensation of over one hundred yuan for damages. The hearing was scheduled for yesterday. Unexpectedly, Ms. Wang Huangshi died on the 6th of this month. Wang believes that his wife's death was undoubtedly caused by the injury. Therefore, he placed the corpse in front of Zhang's house, intending to report it to the authorities. However, Zhang argued that a buttock injury is not fatal, and besides, a long time has passed. He believes that the death was obviously caused by something else. As a result, both parties abandoned the lawsuit for compensation yesterday and each went to the prosecutor's office to request an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Lei, forensic examiner and others crossed the Huangpu River to conduct the examination.</p>
<h3>Tragedy of a Broken Anchor Chain</h3>
<p>Vegetable Boat Smashed to Pieces</p>
<p>Gu Amao Suffers a Foot Injury</p>
<p>The Yichang steamer, owned by the Taikoo Company of this city, which travels between Yantai and Tianjin, dropped anchor at the Bund outside the Taikoo Wharf to load and unload cargo. Gu Amao's barge, which specializes in transporting vegetables, had unloaded its cargo, and the empty boat was moored under the bow of the Yichang steamer. Gu Amao was sleeping in the cabin, and another crew was sleeping at the stern. Yesterday morning at 7:30, the several-hundred-pound anchor suspended from the bow of the Yichang broke its chain and fell, hitting the barge directly. The boat capsized. The crew sleeping at the stern fell into the Huangpu River and were rescued by another boat. The anchor was very heavy, and the impact of the fall was great, smashing Gu's boat to pieces. Gu's foot was also crushed. The total loss to the boat is estimated to be worth several hundred yuan. He is currently in negotiations with the ship owner to seek compensation.</p>
<h3>Youth Struggles for Economic Independence</h3>

<h3>Japanese Ship Refuses to Compensate for Collision</h3>
<p>The Changping Maru steamer, owned by the Dalian Steamship Company of Japan, collided with a lighter carrying soybean cakes and soybean oil belonging to Liyu Oil Company, a member of the Chinese Grain Exchange, in front of Warehouse No. 6 at the Huangpu Wharf. The cargo was completely submerged, with a loss of 1,495 taels, 9 mace, 3 candareens, and 1 cash. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, requesting the company to pay the full amount of the loss. After receiving the letter, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce immediately informed the company. The company has replied, stating that the Changping Maru collided with the lighter to avoid danger. The Changping Maru is not responsible for errors caused by acts of necessity, and the company is determined to reject any claims for damages.</p>
<h3>Flower Gambling is Truly Harmful</h3>
<p>Geese and Ducks Spark a Major Dispute</p>
<p>Mediator Severely Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>In the Dongjiadu area of Tangqiao, Pudong, the practice of flower gambling has become rampant recently. There is even a lottery syndicate located at the Xiaonanmen Wharf at the southern end of Dongjiadu. It dispatches dozens of boatmen every day to solicit gamblers in towns and villages, with hundreds to thousands of cash flowing in and out daily. Three days ago, a Shandong laborer nicknamed "Kuaizi" (chopsticks) at the wharf bet 300 copper coins on "goose" in the syndicate, and the syndicate gave him a slip with the characters "Fengchun" (welcome spring). Kuaizi left without saying anything. When the lottery was drawn, the winning category was "Rongsheng" (flourishing life). After a while, Kuaizi came to claim his winnings, claiming that "Rongsheng" is "goose" as noted in the "Zhifu Quanshu" (Complete Book of Getting Rich, i.e., the flower gambling book). However, the syndicate claimed that "Rongsheng" is "duck" and refused to pay. Kuaizi left angrily. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 5:00 p.m., he suddenly brought thirty or forty laborers, creating a menacing scene. Kuaizi first grabbed the collar of Zhu, a member of the syndicate, and raised his hand to strike him. The others were also itching for a fight and were about to resort to violence. Shi Jinsheng stepped forward to mediate, but Kuaizi transferred his anger to Shi, using a coal basket rope to lasso Shi's neck. At the same time, he punched and kicked him, severely injuring Shi's head, neck, waist, buttocks, etc. Shi fell to the ground, barely breathing. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the assailants dispersed in a rush. Zhu carried Shi to South Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his injuries are critical.</p>
<h3>Two Bicycle Passengers Cause Accidents</h3>
<p>Zhou Wenyong, a five-year-old child, was taken by his older brother to play in front of the Public Sports Ground yesterday morning. Zhou Guitang was riding a bicycle and competing there, causing Wenyong to be knocked down and his abdomen crushed. The child fainted. A police officer saw this and took Zhou Guitang into custody at the Second District Police Station. The child was sent to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, Xie Yunyuan, riding another bicycle competing, also panicked nearby and crashed into a rickshaw puller, Xie Bixian, injuring his ankle. Xie and the rickshaw overturned, and Xie also injured his hands and feet. The police arrived and took him into custody at the Second District and have handed the case over to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Liquor Tax Stamps Affixed</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Second District White Liquor and Tai Jiabao Tobacco and Liquor Public Sales Tax Collection Office has found that liquor sellers in the Nanshi area often affix insufficient or fake tax stamps on white liquor, or even affix tax stamps loosely to the liquor jars, reusing a single stamp multiple times, engaging in arbitrary fraud, which is detrimental to tax revenue. Therefore, the office has dispatched staff to pay attention to the investigation. The other day, the No. 24 tax inspector of the office, while passing through the Wangjiama Wharf area, found that the Yufengyong Liquor Store, located at No. 101 nearby, had a load of white liquor being sent to Xieqiao by their old manager, Lin Abao, a native of Ningbo, but the tax stamp was only affixed to the jar with one corner. The inspector immediately detained the goods and called the police at that location. Together with the evidence, they were taken to the First Division of the First District. The director ordered them to be detained temporarily, pending a preliminary investigation by the director.</p>
<h3>Foreign Potato Boat Sunk by Huge Waves</h3>
<p>Qiu Alin, a boatman from the countryside of Pudong, loaded 129 bags of foreign potatoes purchased by cargo owner Zhu Quanlin from the countryside at 6:00 p.m. the night before last and sailed to Shanghai. Because the cargo was too heavy, the boat was hit by huge waves near the Pudong British-American Tobacco Factory, causing it to sink. The potatoes floated away, but the boat was able to resurface. At that time, a small Asiatic Company boat arrived and towed the boat to a nearby beach. It is reported that the loss of goods is about 300 yuan.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the item "Collision between Warship and Merchant Ship" in the local news section of your newspaper on September 7th, the name of the warship was said to be the Chinese Navy's Weisheng warship, which seems to be a mistake. Upon checking, our ship was stationed at Huangshi Port two months ago and was damaged by the Japanese ship Dalimaru. Last month, it was being repaired at the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy and is still berthed at the Gaochangmiao Wharf and has not yet been completed. The so-called collision with the Yunnan steamer did not happen to our ship. I am sending this letter so that you may make corrections.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Weisheng Warship</p>

<h3>Night Trip to Wusong</h3>
<p>— Su Duyu</p>
<p>Ling, Qiong, Yinlin, Hezi, and myself, a total of five people, were all happy and agreed to go to Wusong for fun. When it comes to having fun, who wouldn't be happy? So, it was decided to go to the seaside on the 14th.</p>
<p>As agreed, the four of us would gather at Ling's house at 7 PM. That day, I had dinner—no, just a snack—at 6:30 PM and went to Ling's house on North Sichuan Road, which was filled with Cantonese flavors.</p>
<p>She looked at the clock, it was only 6:45, and she said to me in surprise,</p>
<p>(Your watch must be fast.)</p>
<p>I didn't understand what she meant. After she explained, I realized she was saying why I was so punctual because she expected us to arrive at least by 7:30 PM. I wanted to say something then, but a small voice in my heart seemed to say, (Are you going to start with your usual clichés again?) So I retracted my long speech and changed it to a playful remark,</p>
<p>(Wouldn't coming earlier shorten the time?)</p>
<p>She was confused by my words, looking at me with a puzzled expression, her eyes wide open, deeply giving off a question mark...</p>
<p>I smiled silently, looked at her, and said,</p>
<p>(I feel like the clock at your house runs much faster.)</p>
<p>She smiled lightly, seeming to say, (Then why don't you make your clock run faster?) Finally, she said that to me. We laughed heartily. In fact, wouldn't anyone who isn't an idiot or a dumb ox understand what I meant? I expected that she would understand.</p>
<p>The clock struck seven. Soon after, thankfully, everyone was punctual. Qiong, Hezi, and Yinlin arrived at the same time. When asked why they came together, they said that Hezi had gone to each of their homes to gather them.</p>
<p>Once everyone was together, we naturally started walking. Yinlin and I carried the snacks, Hezi took the soda, and Ling and Qiong jointly carried a leather bag for cups and other things. Each of us had a task, so we took the public bus to the Tiantong'an Station. Because there is now a small train that runs 77 times a day, there is a train every fifteen minutes. Looking at the train schedule, the next train to Wusong was only two minutes away. We hurried to buy tickets. Although we say "hurried," we still pushed and shoved each other as if there was some benefit to抢着. In fact, this kind of politeness is unnecessary, it would be more straightforward for each person to buy their own ticket. However, at that time, ideal couldn't overcome the environment, and I also挤 to buy a ticket. This really surprised me—in the end, Hezi bought tickets for all of us.</p>
<p>When the train came, we used "squeeze" again. Fortunately, we didn't get separated, and the five of us boarded the same carriage. Soon after, the train started. A bit of wind came into the stuffy carriage. Although the wind was mixed with a lot of coal smoke, it was much better than being闷着.</p>
<p>The train swayed forward. In less than five minutes, we were in Jiangwan. The four square characters of Lida Academy, accompanied by a red heart—the school emblem of Lida—were clearly visible. But the train passed quickly, and I couldn't see many of my school friends in Lida. I don't know what they are doing now. I can only say sorry here—I can't travel with you. Especially my friend Mr. Wu, and the two ladies, Ms. Zhu and Ms. Wen.</p>
<p>After Lida is Jiangwan Station. After a pause, the large clock standing at Labor University? was clearly visible. Looking left from the large clock, there is Lida facing it. Between these two schools, there are some houses. In some houses, my school friend Ms. Cheng lives and watches. I can only look over there with a "helpless" look. In the end, I couldn't join her for a trip.</p>
<p>The train started again, sounded a whistle, and finally pulled my sight back to the car. Ling? Still talking happily. Although Cheng Zhu? and the others didn't come, Ling is here. She looks so much like Cheng. Like Cheng, she also divides her short hair into two forks in the back, fully expressing a naive girl. Also, Qiong's eloquence is not much different from Zhu's. As for Yinlin and Hezi, they also love to joke around. With them, how can we be lonely?</p>
<p>The jumbled conversation continued non-stop. The train stopped at Wusong Station. One by one, we all happily carried our belongings and jumped off the train. The five of us talked and laughed as we walked to the river.</p>
<p>A bright moon burned with clear white light, sprinkling it on everything on the ground. The sea gently rippled, and the moon's light was reflected in the convex and concave water waves, like flickering eyes, like scales, star-like shining. The calm sea was carved with infinite beauty. Looking up at the sky, except for a few larger constellations that could still be seen, most of the unknown thousands of small stars seemed to be hidden as if they were forced by the bright moon. I couldn't help but tell everyone this idea. Qiong playfully pointed to the sea surface. The moonlit waves showed a little bit of light like stars. ? Didn't speak, just laughed. Finally, he forcefully stopped laughing and said,</p>
<p>(Duyu, they are here.)</p>
<p>I admire her eloquence. I hope that such stubborn stars will鑽进enter her chest, illuminating her entire belly with light. At the same time, I will not fail her instructed grandness and answer her by saying,</p>
<p>(Oh, they are really stubborn. Although they can't beat the moon's power, then, then they will go to another place to create their world.)</p>
<p>(But, Duyu, they are hypocritical. Are you willing to pay attention to this point of theirs?) Ling said to me. I couldn't help but sink into thought because of this sentence.</p>
<p>(But such beautiful water waves, can I bear to say that they are伪 fake stars?) I said.</p>
<p>Besides the sound of the sea gently hitting the shore, making small water sounds, there was only the sound of our leather shoes, and Ling and my conversation. She seemed to scoop out her heart, talking very enthusiastically about such things. The ten eyes of the five people patrolled the boundless ocean. From time to time, a few ships emerged with black smoke, becoming a thin line, appearing and disappearing remotely where the water and sky meet. So I would say,</p>
<p>(How magnificent this atmosphere is.)</p>
<p>Hezi, who has always advocated that proletarian literature has the necessity of existing, objected, (But do you know the suffering of the stokers and mechanics who are driving the ships? We are now leisurely enjoying this night trip here, while they are suffering.)</p>
<p>He considers himself a lover of proletarian literature. I used to praise proletarian literature in the same way as him, but recently the rapid tide of the national literature movement touched my heart. I objectively recognized the hypocrisy of proletarian literature. I have long decided to stay away from it. After making such a decision, I once publicized the characteristics and mission of national literature in detail among my friends. Although a little effect has been achieved, like Hezi, he will sometimes admit the benefits of national literature, but suddenly he will go to赞成 support proletarianism again. Tonight he is singing the old tune again, so I can't help but start my theory and say to him,</p>
<p>(Hezi, you should understand the hypocrisy of proletarian literature and not be driven by it. Class war is extremely畸形 deformed. In Soviet Russia, there may be his environment that makes it so, but in China, the environment昭示 revealed to us that it is not the harm of class that has made China so poor and weak. It is really the rampage and oppression of imperialists that has made the Chinese nation turn to污泥 mud. The suffering of the stokers and others in the ship that you are talking about now, we should sympathize with this suffering. If he is working for Chinese merchant ships, although he has suffered hardship, this is his national duty, and he should contribute to the country's transportation business. When we talk about the nation now, we should no longer just self-deceive ourselves with (spiritual civilization), but also start to catch up with the material civilization of the East and the West. This transportation business is a kind of material civilization. It can do a basic job for material civilization. This kind of work is meaningful and upward. We have to praise them and encourage them. What do you think is right? As for the problem of their living expenses, I think it should naturally be a little more generous, because only under a satisfying life can we create better achievements for society.)</p>
<p>He seemed to obey again, responding with (Yes, yes.)</p>
<p>Smoke billows from the ship's chimney, appearing and disappearing where the water and sky meet. Remotely, the five of us silently walked quietly.</p>
<p>Time passed in talk and laughter. The things we brought were all packed in everyone's belly. The bright moon has also risen high, hanging near the top of our heads. Everyone suggested going back. Unanimously approved, we took light steps, hanging a心 heart that had been fully excited, and walked into the train.</p>
<p>The car carried us back to Tiantong'an Station. A few people in the lonely car raised their steps and each踏着 walked on the silent road back to their destination to安宿 settle.</p>
<h3>A Proposal</h3>
<p>The ruthless韶光 time, like flowing water, has passed away. In the blink of an eye, it is another high autumn and refreshing weather. People who have generally suffered under the赤帝 red emperor's power feel a little cool. At this time, various schools are busy preparing for the start of school. A group of students who have放浪 indulged for a summer vacation have to蹩顿 curb themselves and pick up their schoolbags and go to school again. But before entering the school, a problem arises. What is the problem? It seems that these words are written on the two school gates (No money, no entry). Of course, you have to pay tuition fees before entering school. This tuition fee problem does not cause any difficulties for the children of rich families, but what about the children of poor families? During this period of米珠薪桂 rice as pearls and cinnamon as firewood, fathers and brothers use sweat and blood money to spend on a family that cannot even eat enough to be warm. Where can they have spare money for their children to go to school? For the sake of this万恶 evil money, I don't know how many ambitious young people have been buried. For the sake of grief and anger, they take the path of消极 negativity—many of them are堕落 fallen. How sad and painful this is for us.</p>
<p>In my personal feeling, the strength or weakness of a country is closely related to education. Our country has declined to such a point because education is not普及 popular—the people lack knowledge. If we want the country to be strong, we must普及 popularize education. If we want to普及 popularize education, we must solve the above难題 problem. But how can we solve it? Schools have all kinds of expenses and of course they cannot let us study for free. The only way is for the government to set up a few work-study schools to cultivate this class of ambitious people who want to study but have no ability. If we do this, I believe education can普及 popularize and our country can become strong. (Peizhen)</p>

<h3>Interview with George Bernard Shaw (1)</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>— A Lovable Child of Seventy-Three —</p>
<p>Swells Stokes published an article about George Bernard Shaw in (The New Statesman), saying, "The most exciting thing in my life has been the time I recently spent alone with George Bernard Shaw. I have never met, nor do I expect to meet again, a more lovable child of seventy-three. If any woman can be forgiven for jealousy, it is Mrs. Shaw, because her husband's lovableness makes everyone he meets praise him. His youth is completely迷感 fascinating. He is so young, thin, and joyful that one suspects he has made some secret pact with the devil, like Faust. To put it plainly, he is a young man who will keep his youth until death. If physical health is of great value, then his death will probably not happen while I am alive. I think there are still fifty years of work to be done."</p>
<p>The legend says that a drowning person sees his entire past in a moment before he dies, but if George Bernard Shaw were ever to reach this point—Heaven forbid—what he would see would not be the past but the future. His inclination is different from that of people of his age. He has great interest in the future and attaches great importance to progress. He pays great attention to new creations. I asked him, (Are you interested in sound movies?)</p>
<p>This was a stupid question, but I often hear senior gentlemen criticize sound movies, and the old gentlemen are very enthusiastic about this little condemnation. In this way, before I thought that the person I was talking to was a enthusiastic youth, this question had already slipped out of my mouth.</p>
<p>(I am very interested in sound movies,) George Bernard Shaw replied, (I will tell you why.) He really told me that he was very interested in this new creation of movies because with this medium, he could finally make his perfect drama public to the world.</p>
<p>(This is impossible,) he said, (To obtain a perfect drama production on stage, for example, a drama director practices the script very carefully, and it looks almost perfect on Monday night, but who dares to say what it will become on Tuesday? After that, a伶人 actor can复演 replay a script without any change. It looks very good on the first night, but it regresses on the second night, but the film has one advantage. Capturing drama through film can achieve a perfect production. Like Chaplin, it can take a lot of time to make a film ten金 ten美 perfect, and finally he will connect the fragments. The result is a perfect product that is传之 permanent.)</p>
<p>(Then why didn't you agree to have your dramas made into films before?) I asked George Bernard Shaw, knowing the answer to this question. But I wanted him to tell me personally.</p>
<p>He said, (Before the invention of sound movies, film merchants did not want my dramas, and the same was true for others. I knew they would buy scripts, but why? Dramas are made up of dialogue. When making films, the dialogue is completely removed, so a successful film drama is not a drama at all.)</p>
<p>Often Thorough</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw is often thorough. I remember Sir Philip Gibbs telling me how surprised he was when he took this playwright to the aircraft camp during the war and heard him tell people about the many knowledge of their machines, like a skilled mechanic. The same is true for sound movies. George Bernard Shaw carefully studied this matter as if it were his lifelong career. He had very little unclear about the reproduction of sound. In recent years, he has been very interested in studying phonographs and other methods of storing sound.</p>
<p>He said to me, (The difficulty is that individuals are呌 called inexperienced beauty dramatists to move or speak. He never tells伊 them the speed of the most important movements and speeches. Several years ago, a filmmaker asked me to take a segment of film. They told me that康拉 and仁惠尔 had already been tested, so I agreed to this request. When the卡麥拉 camera was taking my movements, I walked into a room, took off my hat, sat down, and took a pen in my hand to start my work. I did these movements very naturally as usual, but when I saw it reflected on the screen, it became like this,)</p>
<p>During our conversation, George Bernard Shaw rose from the couch and mimicked the action shown on the screen for me. This proved that he was as talented a伶人 actor as his dramatic genius. Every one of his gestures was strangely funny and made people laugh, as if it were taken with a slow-motion camera.</p>
<p>He sat down again and said, (They should tell me to restrain my natural movements. You understand that a person does not have to move for the film, just move gently. Even if a person's thoughts can be translated into movements for the camera, an伶人 actor only wants to move an impression onto the screen.) George Bernard Shaw went on to say solemnly, (I don't mean that most movie stars can think for themselves, but a producer can tell them what to think.)</p>
<p>Returning to the issue of sound reproduction, George Bernard Shaw said, (The success of that matter also depends on the speed at which the record rotates during production. When it rotates slowly, the collected sound is accurate and easy to distinguish. In fact, a phonograph record just calls people to reveal their original appearance. A record that调和 harmonizes its appropriate speed can clearly indicate the origin of this person. At my home in the countryside, there is a record that was recorded before. If that record is slowly started, you can hear me speaking in exquisite Irish pronunciation. I sing the old丐 beggar on杜白林 Dublin street. If the speed increases, my voice gradually合乎 conforms to the rule, ending with you hearing me speak as I do now.)</p>
