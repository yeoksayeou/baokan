<h3>（一）中匪之役</h3>
<p>此次遠東運動會足球賽菲隊本不甚强第一次與日相抗一敗塗地結果爲七與二之比加以我隊威風早已聞名喪膽軍無鬥志故此次之戰球常在匪隊區域之内開賽以後我隊頻頻攻擊菲隊　門技術甚佳往往將球救出且又右後衛之臂助故我軍雖屢屢打門亦不易得分有時匪隊反攻突然其來我後衛竟爲之乘虚而入陷於危境幸周鐵門仆地救出然亦險矣我隊戰策注重左翼進攻使敵出而預防乃乘虚傳中故中鋒及左右二鋒往往有立功機會上半時我隊以三比零獲勝下半塲雖以二比零獲勝然球藝殊不精彩傳球不準屢爲菲人所襲擊幸内衛與龍門把有危險聞其所以如此者留力以備與日本戰云</p>

<h3>低訴贊華</h3>
<p>陸晶清女士著詩集　　在冷寂的詩壇上近來居然看到了幾本女性的詩集這是頗使我們注意的　　過去並不是没是過女子的詩集只是在我所見過的看來不是高談着哲理玄妙到令人不可思議便是以春花秋月爲消遣的東西固然也有許多寫來是很悲哀的訴説内心的苦悶然而這種悲哀苦悶却不見得怎樣深切動人而大半是一種青春期的多愁善感罷了　　（低訴）這本詩一開卷作者便把她那（滿腹辛酸在人前化作了輕淺的微笑）的舊作來代序這自然一望而知是一本悲哀的作品不過據我看來好這種悲哀却不是一般坐在深閨繡　裏的女性所能感受得到的而是踏遍了社會魔鬼所設的網幕一種内在的脅迫的宣泄　　書中共分前後兩部包含着二十六首詩其中除了（出征）（祭辭）兩首比較豪壯奔放外其他差不多都一致的充滿了抑鬱悲哀的情調我們從這裏可以看出作者的人生觀以及好在社會上所感受到的是些什麽同時更可以看出曾經捲入革命的高潮中的女性好們失敗後是一個怎樣的態度　　作者的身世是很凄凉的血痕斑駁是充滿了她的詩句我們看她那初感到人間的煩惱寫的是（想當年我原是一株小小的忘憂草被帶到妝台傍我才知人間有煩惱）（第七六頁）這顯然是一位充滿发幻想的少女與現實接觸後所感到的煩惱然後好是勇敢地走入社會了開始她那柳絮般的向着天涯漂泊結果乃感到（我不幸被譴到人世受漂零二十年如一夢只落得血淋淋這顆心）（第六五頁）與那（這幾載負痛創流落天涯受盡了顚連）（第二頁）的沉痛的呼喊其次她是懷着滿腔熱情走遍了天涯海角如失母的小羊似的找不到歸宿喊其次她是懷着滿腔熱情走遍了天涯海角如失母的小羊似的找不到歸宿因此深深地感受到孤獨的悲哀了如（我·寒窗獨坐只孤燈相伴）（第十五頁）與那（我如孤雁流落在天涯惆悵）（第十六頁）便盡最地把這種情緒表現了出來再次便是好（爲了追求無踪的幻影消逝了青春年復年）（第三頁）而不勝其惋惜青春之不再了在（毁妝）一首更是顯然地（爲了逝去的青春我追悔懊惱）（第</p>

<p>中華民國十九年六月十日（申報本二十五頁）的作品最後便是基於以上種種的原因事實上迫令好不能不去找尋出路於是在那個環境中好便（準備將這小小身軀投向戰線去）（第四七頁）而獻身於革命的洪流在這個時期好顯然有過一度的振作看好在（出征）裏高喊着（革命的同志跨上戰馬齊赴沙場）（第八一頁）和那首極其悲壯的（祭辭）便知道倘不是在革命的高潮中經過了的女性單據想像是决乎寫不出來的不過這種時期很短的便成了過去幻象的破滅又給好一個猛烈的打擊好旣不能再鼓起勇氣奮鬥於是便悲哀沉痛到不可收拾了看好那（從此我將沉醉於毒盃中恣情於漂泊潦倒）（第十一頁）更想到欲以青燈古佛作解脱如（那裏有深山古刹呵我願出塵料青燈古佛旁當容我暫棲身）（第五四頁）甚至於幻滅到（今生已無有希冀但願長眠於無人之靜境）簡直是欲以死亡來解除現實的痛苦了　　以上大槪可以説是作者的經歷與思想的轉變這裏面我們可以看出一個歷史的背景而作者也便是在這一個時代和環境下的産物　　本來中國這十餘年來的智識階級的婦女在思想方面正也是經過了好幾次轉變的當着（五四）運動中那個時期西方婦女運動的思潮排山倒海而來尤以托爾斯泰和易卜生的思想爲深入當時婦女受其影響而感到自身的缺陷經濟的不能獨立以及婚姻的不自由因之發生苦悶悲哀的現象幾乎是風靡一時這個意識反映到實際上於是和娜拉般的出走以及消極的抱獨身主義的行動與空想以參政爲出路便也層出不窮但是這却是偏於一隅的其於社會尚未得到明確的了解國民革命發生婦女的思潮又爲一變客觀的事實决定了好們的命運便也實際地以從事革命行動爲出路了等到國民革命軍進展到長江流域這個運動便漸漸地擴大而進一步以上馬殺敵置身前綫爲榮這一種英勇奮發的精神非特洗盡了中國數千年的閨房弱質的習氣而且造成了不可磨滅的光樂的歷史不過這個行動因着客觀事實的轉變曇花一現地便消逝了於是一般從革命戰綫上紛紛退下的好們便大多數的和作者同樣地走入了那幻滅的一條路上云　　雖然我們覺得好們之走上這條幻滅的路是不對的錯誤的但以大多數的女性經不得這樣的大時代的分化也是一個必然的現象要消滅這種現象問題甚大非片言所能了容有機會時再談　　再從詩的形式上看來這本詩集裏面大都是四角整齊像刀截了似的詩本來這種詩是受了西方行詩的影響在中國首先開其端的要算是徐志摩朱湘等不過那時還没有這樣的齊整可是一到于賡虞便越發變本加厲起來在這種形式的詩中他的句子每行差不多都是齊齊整整地排列的甚至於一個字也不參差雖然其中四行·六行·八行不等但押脚都必須要協韻而力求推敲裝飾以眩人耳目在本書的作者便頗受了他的影響　　雖然我們不能説詩是不須要修飾的但是却要修飾得自然雕琢得自然而不留斧鑿的痕跡更不能妨碍詩的内容並能把詩的内容更美化的毫不受束縛地表現出來這才算是善於修飾的打個比喻詩的修飾也正如一個人的裝飾一樣胭脂粉固然是能增加美觀的但是搽得的不適宜塗得滿頭滿臉都是紅便紅到像戲台上的關雲長白便白到像城隍廟的白無常走到人前豈不是要令見者揑一把冷汗嗎那裏還談得上美呢所以像賈島孟郊那樣的推敲而元好問竟目他爲（詩囚）不過是囚在形式的籠裏做了俘虜罷了那裏還談得上做詩呢　　在這裏我們覺得這四角齊整的詩便未能走出形式的囚籠簡直有些可以説是爲了形式而有内容並不是有了内容而有形式所以有些這類的作品便免不了矯揉造作堆砌塗飾的毛病往往有些本是很自然的句子一到他們手裏爲了要顧全與其他句子一樣長短起見便不惜的牽强雜凑幾個字上去於是本來是一個很美的人也就被他們塗脂抹粉弄得人不像人鬼不像鬼了在本書的前集作者便患了很多處這種的毛病　　其次便是我們所常見到的在這種形式的詩裏面往往易於夾入許多從詩·詞·曲·裏脱胎而來的句子像本書中的（生死殊途兩渺茫）（第十五頁）和（白馬紫金鞍）（第八十頁）之類的句子豈不是與五七言的舊詩相彷彿嗎此外像詞化的如（莫提往事往事那堪再提起）（第六九頁）像曲化的如（任海枯石爛我把你恩情記）（第六八頁）和（唱罷陽關你看着我的行塵起從此後我們相思相憶風雨夕）（第六九頁）更有像京調的如（最堪歎｜）（想當年）（第五三頁）這不是成了一大盤雜菜嗎　　一點不能令人滿意的便是作者喜歡用那些（寳刀）（青聰）（玉顔）一紅燭）之類的字來裝飾他的詩句　　最後全書看來我在比較上是喜歡（出征）和（祭辭）因爲好給我們女性留下一頁值得寳貴和追念的光榮的歷史　　夜凉如水輕風送來（奴呀奴）（毛毛雨）的歌聲使我更不禁的想會着那一般曾經血戰沙塲的女性來</p>

        <h1>1930.06.10</h1>
<h3>Natural Frugality</h3>
<p>The most irresistible force in the world is the power of nature. If people can make good use of this natural force to plan things, they can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The reason why water power is stronger than electricity is also because of its naturalness. Therefore, people can use this natural water power to replace electricity. The source and development of world affairs and trends, from brewing to venting, also have extremely powerful natural forces in the invisible. Those who are good at planning things observe the origin of natural trends in order to take precautions in advance, and follow the natural trend to seek remedies at the beginning of things, so that there will be real benefits. Now, after the industrial and commercial slump in various countries, they are followed by a gold rush, and they are all tending to frugality, which is indeed a trend that must be frugal. This is the so-called natural frugality. The Japanese government previously implemented a frugal policy, but it had no effect in the end. The Japanese even said that it would only lead to the decline of industry and commerce. Why is this? Because the trend has not yet reached the point of being natural. Now, their government has implemented a new frugal policy, which only expresses dissatisfaction with those who oppose the government, while most people regard it as a matter of course. Why is this? Because the trend has reached the natural period. Although the United States prides itself on its wealth, its President Hoover has recently admonished his people with frugality. It can be seen that today's frugal policy will be a universal policy in the world, and it cannot be forced by human power. Taking the national aspect as an example, why did people previously repeatedly advise to use domestic goods, but the people turned a deaf ear? Because they still have the strength to purchase foreign goods, and even if it costs a little more, it will not have an impact, so there is no need to worry too much. Now, however, foreign goods are becoming more and more expensive, and the people's purchasing power is exhausted. They will naturally not use foreign goods without being persuaded, and they will also naturally return to using domestic goods without being persuaded. This is also what is called coming from nature. However, in this trend of natural frugality, if one only engages in frugality without seeking other ways to develop, then this general trend will inevitably lead to a point where there is nothing to be frugal about. This is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death. Therefore, I say that on the one hand, we must implement frugality, and on the other hand, we must strive to find a way to break free from this inescapable trend in order to seek self-preservation. Because there is no shortage of favorable opportunities in this trend, which lies in the Chinese people's ability to make good use of them.</p>

<p>Nanjing News: Niu Yongjian, Minister of the Interior, Zhang Weihua, Permanent Deputy Minister, and Wei Daoming, Mayor of Nanjing Special City, held the swearing-in ceremony in the auditorium of the government at 10:00 AM on the 9th, after the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week of the National Government. Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Gu Yingfen, Enhebatou, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, Yi Peiji, Zhang Nanxian, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Yi, Huang Musong, Li Shijia, Wu Siyu, Zheng Hongnian, Qin Hua, Zhong Ketuo, Lin Xiang, Chen Yu, Zhou Yawei, Sun Bowen, Li Jinlun, and more than 300 representatives from various agencies, including officials from the National Government's Ministry of the Interior and the Municipal Government, attended. After Tan Yankai, Chairman of the meeting, performed the ceremony, he first held the seal conferring ceremony. Tan represented the Chairman of the National Government in conferring the seal. Niu Yongjian and Wei Daoming accepted the seal separately, followed by the swearing-in ceremony. Niu, Zhang, and Wei all raised their right hands to take the oath. Wang Chonghui, a member of the Central Committee, supervised the oath. After the oath, Wang Chonghui, the representative of the Central Committee, gave a speech, saying that history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, has shown us that if internal affairs are not well managed, we cannot resist foreign aggression. If internal affairs are well managed and we strive for self-improvement, we can not only stand in the world but also lead the world. The party's program is to strive to abolish unequal treaties externally. If internal affairs can be well managed, abolishing unequal treaties should not be a problem. Comrades Niu and Zhang have struggled in the party for a long time, and I believe they will be able to implement the party's program, follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, and strive to manage internal affairs well. If we can do this, then all external problems can be solved easily. Municipal administration is also a scope of internal affairs, although narrow, the situation is the same. Comrade Wei has studied municipal administration quite a bit and should seek the welfare of the entire city in the future. Tan Yankai then gave a speech, saying that since the establishment of the National Government, most of the various laws have been formulated and promulgated, but the achievements in internal affairs in the past two years have been very few. The reason is that the military has not been settled and measures are not easy to take. Today, Comrades Niu and Zhang are taking office, and I hope they will work hard to gradually show achievements in internal affairs. Municipal administration is related to the image of a country. Nanjing is the seat of the National Government and the starting point of all laws. However, I hope that after Comrade Wei takes office, he will work with the internal affairs authorities to unify the laws and make them a model for the whole country. Niu Yongjian, Zhang Weihua, and Wei Daoming then gave speeches in response, and the ceremony ended with music and photography. (9th)</p>

<h3>Northern Party Affairs Disputes</h3>

<h3>Accession of the New King of Romania</h3>
<p>Carol Sworn in as King, the Army Expressed Loyalty to the New Monarch. Reuters, Rome, 8th: The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held separate meetings and decided to abolish the decree of January 4, 1926, which removed Carol's right as crown prince. Only one vote was against this proposal. Subsequently, the two houses jointly convened Parliament and passed the motion proposed by the Minister of Justice, Zhuning, to elect Carol as King with 486 votes against one. During the speech, shouts of "Long live Carol II" arose, and amid the cheers of the crowd, the official announcement of Carol's ascension was issued. Carol then took the oath of office in the House of Representatives, and his son Michael is now the crown prince. The Mironescu cabinet, originally formed to prepare for Carol's accession, has resigned after completing its mission. Reuters, Rome, 8th: After being sworn in at the House of Representatives today, the new King Carol stated in his speech that his arrival was not to retaliate against anyone, but to unite people who wish to cooperate for the progress of the country. He is determined to protect the security of the country's land and relies on the cooperation of all people to fulfill this wish. Without public unity, it would be impossible to deal with foreigners. Reuters, Rome, 9th: King Carol and his ex-wife agreed after talks that neither side seeks to dissolve the divorce for the time being, but agreed that the education of their young son Michael should be under the King's control. The Queen Mother sent a telegram to congratulate Carol on his accession. The army has sworn loyalty to the new monarch, who re-proclaimed the national address in the Parliament to all the people. Reuters, London, 9th: This morning's newspaper's headline news is the accession of the new king. According to recent dispatches from Rome, the new king intends to reconcile with his ex-wife, Princess Helen, but some sources say that the princess still wants to live separately. It is reported that when King Carol took his son Michael from his ex-wife, the young child, who had been on the throne for several years, shed tears and was unwilling to leave his loving mother. Reuters, Tokyo, 9th: It is heard that senior naval officers, such as the Vice Minister of the Navy and the Vice Chief of Naval Staff, will be replaced. The official announcement will be seen tomorrow. Although the authorities claim that this is only a routine annual transfer, the public is paying close attention because several of these officers stood out in the London Naval Treaty dispute. According to a key source, this move was agreed upon by the Minister of the Navy, the Ministry of Finance, and the Chief of Naval Staff, Kato. It is widely believed that the difficulties arising from the London Naval Treaty can be alleviated through this change. The Japanese government intends to</p>
<h3>Changing Important Personnel</h3>
<p>To Ease the Hardline Views of the Military. Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th: To ease the hardline views of the military, the government plans to replace important personnel on the 10th. Vice Minister Mishima, a leader of hardline arguments, will be ordered to retire to a vacant position in the military, and Lieutenant General Nagano Osami, the current principal of the Army Military Academy, will succeed him. As a result, a major wave will occur within the Navy, and even the position of Kato, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, may be difficult to maintain. The issue of supreme command is tending to become more complicated. Furthermore, Vice Minister Yamanashi, who had long intended to resign when the Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff was replaced, will also be ordered to retire to a vacant position in the military, and Lieutenant General Kobayashi Seizo, the Director of the Naval Technical Department, will succeed him. Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th: The Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy entered the palace on the morning of the 7th to request the convening of a meeting of military councillors. Although the government pretends that this is an internal naval matter and unrelated, if the outcome of this meeting, concerning the issue of supreme command and military strength, puts the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy in a difficult position and forces them to acknowledge the military's proposal for enhancement, then the government's relationship with the military will inevitably deteriorate due to budgetary issues. Therefore, there is great fear in their hearts. Ten Indian Nationalist Party Members</p>

<h3>American Special Academies</h3>
<p>Focusing on Academic Research. Improving Training Standards. National News Agency, Newark, 8th: Mr. Pemberton of the United States and the widow of Mr. Fuld, who previously partnered with him, jointly announced today that they have saved 5 million gold dollars to establish an extraordinary university dedicated to prominent scholars to focus on academic research and teach talented students, so that their achievements far exceed those of today's philosophy and other doctoral degrees. The detailed plan will be announced soon. According to reports, this move is highly supported by celebrities from all walks of life. In recent years, the trend of education in the United States and the world has been extremely focused on mass education, resulting in excessively low training standards. High-achieving students are inevitably in the same stable as inferior horses. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an academy to cultivate high-achieving students. Family Unity</p>

<h3>The Japanese Government's Budget Policy</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th: The Ministry of Finance has begun preparing the budget for Showa 6. The Japanese government has largely decided on the following guidelines for budget preparation: 1. The principle of thorough austerity remains the same as before. 2. Except for unemployment relief expenses, new project expenses will only be required for emergency expenses each year. 3. For the right-wing project expenses, part of the machinery tax will be used to enhance national defense deficiencies. Based on the above items, the Administrative Reform Committee will thoroughly save expenditures. However, the general accounting still adheres to the principle of non-debt financing. Although special accounting reaches 140 million yuan, according to the current situation, the expenditure will be reduced as prices fall, and the time limit will be extended, so the actual expenditure is only about 80 million yuan. There is no risk of financial breakdown.</p>

<h3>Central Committee and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 9th, the Central Committee held the 63rd Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Miao Peicheng, Gui Chongji, Cheng and more than a hundred other people paid their respects. Chairman Hu Hanmin reported: (1) The recent military strategy adopted by the front line is very advantageous. The rebel army of Zhang Gui cannot gain a foothold in Guangxi and has fled into Hunan. Now, the land, sea, and air forces are working together to encircle and suppress them. It can be pacified in a few days. (2) Regarding the Land Law drafted by the Legislative Yuan, after being drafted by the drafting committee, it was further reviewed in detail by the Legal, Financial, and Economic Committees and submitted to the conference. Most of the essential elements of the country have been passed after our discussions. China has never had a special code for the land issue. Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated the Principle of People's Livelihood, noting that in the Chinese social situation, the rich have vast estates, while the poor have no place to stand, which is too unfair. Therefore, the principle is to equalize land rights. The Legislative Yuan has formulated regulations based on this principle, the main points of which are: (1) People's ownership of land includes three types of disposition, use, and income, which the state can recognize, but each should have a corresponding scope. (2) Land rights should be considered publicly owned, with the supreme right belonging to all citizens, but people's enjoyment of land rights is still allowed to be free. Public ownership and private ownership cannot be rigidly advocated and must be considered in accordance with legal principles and human feelings so that both public and private interests are not hindered. If it cannot be publicly owned or privately owned, will it not become non-existent? (3) Since people have the right to dispose of all land, they can freely buy and sell it, but if it is sold to someone who cannot freely purchase land in China under the law, the state cannot allow it. Also, if the land in a certain area has been designated by the state or local government for a certain undertaking, and it is sold to others for their operation of another undertaking, which disrupts the construction plan, it should also be restricted. The same applies to the right to use. (4) The state should especially encourage people to improve their land so that no land is wasted. (5) The fees for land registration are extremely low, but the processing must be strict to ensure that it is accurate. (6) The standard rent for farmers leasing land shall not exceed 37.5%. Tenants may continue to lease when the lease expires if they do not violate the law or default on rent. (7) The increase in land value is unearned income and should originally be nationalized, but some leeway is still left. If the price increase exceeds an unexpected level, this law will have special provisions. (8) There is a certain maximum and minimum limit for large landlords to avoid monopoly. Other chapters and sections that have not yet been passed are being discussed to ensure completion as soon as possible. The meeting adjourned after the report. At 10 a.m. on the same day, the National Government held Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week, attended by Tan Yankai, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Shao Yuanchong, Gu Yingfen, Enkbatuer, Yi Peiji, Zhang Nanxian, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Jiao Yitang, Chen Yi, Wu Siyu, Zheng Hongnian, Niu Yongjian, Lin Xiang, Wei Daoming, Zhang Wohua, Li Jinlun, Zhu Luhe, and more than 300 officers and staff from the civil affairs and military affairs departments. Chairman Tan Yankai presided over the ceremony, followed by a political report by Secretary Qian Changzhao: (Military aspects: The Longhai and Pinghan Railways are very smooth. Kaifeng and Zhengzhou can be taken down in a few days. The situation on the Jinpu Railway is also good, and Jinan is not in danger. Although there are remnants of Zhang Gui rebelling in Hunan, the troops transferred from Guangdong and Yunnan are marching north as quickly as possible. Jiangxi has already sent troops to participate in the battle. Hubei has sufficient strength and is presided over by Minister He Yingqin, so it is good to send troops to attack and annihilate Zhang Gui's remnants in the encirclement. The scope of this military operation is very large, and the government is very concerned about the people who have directly and indirectly sacrificed for the revolution. A plan for condolences and compensation is already being coordinated before the end of the military operation, and after the end of the military operation, various measures must be taken to reduce the suffering of the people and restore the vitality of society. The Mongolian conference has not yet closed. The representatives have been in the original capital for many days, and they should be able to understand the situation of the central government more clearly than before. The central government and the representatives have been in contact for days, and they will definitely know more about the situation in Mongolia. I have already talked about the importance of the conference and how to start developing Mongolia. At this moment, there is still a concern (maybe it is not necessary to worry). We all know that the future development of Mongolia depends entirely on the genuine cooperation between Mongolia and the compatriots in the mainland. Therefore, Mongolia must not have the slightest fear or suspicion of the compatriots in the mainland, and the compatriots in the mainland who go to Mongolia must not be keen on private interests. If Mongolia has no reason to fear or suspect the compatriots in the mainland, then they will fall into a narrow and limited local concept, and the result of fear or suspicion will inevitably be rejection or exclusion. This can discourage the compatriots in the mainland who are interested in developing Mongolia, and all construction projects will be hindered, which is a bad phenomenon. As for the compatriots in the mainland who go to Mongolia, if they are keen on private interests, then their purpose is to make money or arrange forces. Among them, the black sheep may use improper means to deceive the Mongolian compatriots who have simpler minds and kinder hearts. They may achieve their goals for a while, but the resulting ill feelings will be a permanent obstacle to the future development of Mongolia, which is very dangerous. In fact, the five ethnic groups are one family, and pure mutual assistance is very necessary. What needs to be prevented is the ambition of the imperialists. Mongolia and the mainland are like loving elder and younger brothers. The elder brother sees that the younger brother's industry is not developing much, and at the same time, there are many foreign covetousness, so he should help and absolutely not have selfish intentions. The younger brother sees that the elder brother is helping with great sincerity, and should welcome him very much and have no fear or suspicion. If they also work harder, then the industry can be sorted out, and foreigners will have no chance to invade. The genuine cooperation between Mongolia and the mainland should have the same spirit. The trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap is now irreversible. The price of silver has risen to about 600 taels, and imports and exports have been greatly reduced. I have talked about the causes and effects of this trend. If our country wants to remedy it, such as changing to a gold standard, unifying the currency system, and developing industry, these are indeed fundamental solutions, but they are not easy to do in a short period of time. The results of other symptomatic treatments are often counterproductive if one is not careful, which is extremely dangerous. We must know that this trend is due to the changes in the world's gold and silver markets, which cannot be reversed by the power of our country alone. Therefore, the planning and maintenance must be done in cooperation with the international community. In fact, our country is the first to bear the brunt and suffer the greatest losses, and all countries in the world are also directly and indirectly affected. Under these serious circumstances, my personal opinion is that even if our country convenes an international conference specifically for this purpose, all countries should not refuse (in addition to our country directly convening an international conference, there are two other ways: one is to have the League of Nations convene it, but the United States has not yet joined the League of Nations, which may be inconvenient; one is to have our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs contact the countries separately, but it is not easy to get the point by contacting them separately. The government has already ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to contact Britain and France, but there have been no results). If an international conference can be convened, then the cessation of silver sales in India and Indochina, the restriction of silver production in Mexico, etc., can all be discussed at length, and perhaps a more appropriate solution can be obtained to stabilize silver prices. Once silver prices are stabilized, our country's economy will reduce the risk, and the world's finances can also be consolidated. At this moment, I also have a feeling that some people in our country are extremely impulsive when an important issue has just occurred, but after a considerable period of time, even if the issue is more serious than before, the general public becomes indifferent. Some can only let it go because there is no way to solve it, and some have become negative and no longer express their opinions because their own opinions cannot be adopted. Some people simply do not understand the issue, and initially followed the social psychology with some impulsiveness, but later lost their stimulation. These are not good phenomena. I hope everyone pays special attention to the relationship between gold being expensive and silver being cheap, which is related to the survival of our country.</p>

<h3>Clearing Old Debt Payments in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>According to the latest statistics from the Finance Department, Jiangsu Province still owes 5.6 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, over 420,000 yuan in incremental bonds, and over 940,000 yuan in exchange coupons. When Zhang Shouyong was the head of the Finance Department, creditors repeatedly sent telegrams urging repayment, but they were all replied with words such as "(should wait for the case to be consolidated and planned as a whole)", which was delayed for several years without any concrete measures. Recently, the provincial government ordered Director Chen Qicai to draft clearing measures and submit them to the meeting for review. It is heard that Chen's opinion is to first amortize the disaster relief bonds in ten-year installments based on the original debt, with a lottery drawn in June and December of each year, starting from December of this year until June of the 31st year to repay the full amount, and exempting interest in accordance with the precedent of Zhang Shouyong's repayment of debt during his tenure. As for the capital repayment fund, the price increase of Huainan, Su, and five other prefectures, as well as Anhui shore salt, is designated as a fixed fund. It is found that the annual income from the aforementioned salt price increase is approximately 1.6 million yuan, of which 600,000 yuan has been contracted by former Director Zhang to repay the debt of the Zhongjiao Su Sanxing Bank and listed in the 19th-year budget revenue of 500,000 yuan. The remainder will be used as a fund and specially deposited on a monthly basis for lottery repayment. As for other incremental bonds, exchange coupons, and loans approved by local chambers of commerce and firms, they will be gradually cleared once the budget is slightly more prosperous.</p>
<h3>Military News from the Longhai Line</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Comforts Wounded Soldiers. A Quick Letter from Xuzhou. The military situation on the Longhai Line remains unchanged, with no developments. The front-line battle news is quiet, but the two wings are quite intense. The enemy troops have repeatedly counterattacked, but they have been repelled by the Central Army and have not been able to cross the thunder pool. The Central Army has also broken through the enemy's front line with flanking attacks. Commander-in-Chief Chiang often travels back and forth between the front and rear to arrange all military affairs. Today (the 7th), Chiang returned to the city with a light entourage, including Aide-de-Camp Zhang Zhen and Secretary Gao Lingbai, from the front line to comfort the wounded soldiers. The reporter saw Chiang at the station wearing a brown Zhongshan uniform, in high spirits. It can be seen that the foreign news that Chiang was injured is not credible. After arriving in the city in the morning, Chiang took a car to the rear hospitals to personally comfort the officers, giving each 30 yuan, and the soldiers, giving each 10 yuan, and giving them considerable encouragement. He Yaozu arrived in the city today by special train from Jinan, accompanied by Aide-de-Camp Chen Jishan and several attendants. After arriving at the station at noon, he went to the headquarters to meet with the chairman. After the discussion, he returned to the car. The reporter interviewed him in the car, and according to He, the situation in Jinan is good. The enemy troops, led by Zuo Yiyi, attempted to cross the river to attack, but were repelled. Our army is defending along the river and is very solid, so there is no need to worry. Commander-in-Chief Han is commanding military affairs in Jinan, and Liu Zhennian in Jiaodong has expressed his support. There are not many enemy troops in western Shandong, and the local area is quiet. He may have to go west tonight.</p>
<h3>Pan's Troops Ordered to Disarm the Vanguard</h3>
<p>The complete resolution after a few hours of fierce fighting in Zhengyang. A dispatch from Bengbu. Liu Yizhai, the commander of the First Vanguard of the Henan Anti-Rebellion Army, was originally appointed by the headquarters to contain the enemy troops. However, Liu did not work in Henan Province and instead entered Anhui. In the spring, he set up the Vanguard Headquarters in Zhengyangguan and appointed Wang Pengchao as the commander of the First Division and Ma Xunchen as the commander of the Second Division, and also appointed dozens of brigade commanders and regimental commanders and ordered them to recruit soldiers. Many retired military officers in northern Anhui flocked to him, so mixed-brand military officers were everywhere inside and outside the city of Zhengyangguan. In March, on the pretext of lack of military funds, he first sent people to carry Mauser pistols to borrow 5,000 yuan from the Zhengyang Customs, but only borrowed 500 yuan. He then detained the customs chief Wu and supervised the collection of taxes by customs staff. In March and April, he successively took away more than 30,000 yuan in taxes. The Fengyang Customs Commissioner Lu Bin reported this to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and asked him to stop it. After learning of this, Chiang believed that the department's unauthorized withdrawal of taxes was intended to undermine the administrative system and was not allowed during the period of political tutelage. He specially ordered Pan Shanzhai, the commander of the newly編 Fifth Brigade, to be responsible for disarming the department. After receiving the order, Pan dispatched a team to Zhengyang on the 4th of this month and made strict arrangements. At 4:00 a.m. the next morning (the 5th), he ordered the encirclement and ordered the disarmament. Liu's troops initially refused to obey and opened fire to resist. Some of them occupied the ancient temple and stubbornly resisted. After a few hours of fierce fighting, Liu's troops were outnumbered and defeated by Pan's brigade, with many killed. In the end, they were exhausted and completely disarmed. Pan's brigade seized more than a hundred guns. Some of Liu's soldiers escaped with their weapons, and Liu himself also fled. When Liu's troops were disarmed, the residents of Zhengyang were slightly alarmed, but the local area was still peaceful. After the resolution, Brigade Commander Pan has reported the details of the disarmament to his superiors. (June 7th)</p>
<h3>Revised Freight Rates on the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>To Be Implemented from July 1st.</p>
<p>A Dispatch from Qingdao. The freight rates on the Jiaoji Railway were originally set by the Germans and were still used during the Japanese occupation period. After China took over, the basic system was not changed except for a 20% increase in May of the 16th year, which is different from the national railways. In the past, freight rates were roughly divided into two types: full carload and less-than-carload. In addition to calculating the transportation mileage, the freight rate also varied depending on the direction of transportation and the area of origin and destination. The freight rates for the same distance varied greatly and can be roughly divided into the following three types: (1) Inland freight rate: The inland freight rate applies to goods transported between stations on the main and branch lines from Nügu Kou to Ji. It is the highest price rate for all types of full carload freight rates. (2) Import freight rate: The import freight rate applies to goods transported from the Jiao'ao area (i.e., Qingdao Dagaang Sifang Cangkuo four stations) to stations on the main and branch lines from Nügu Kou to Jinan. It is the second highest price rate for full carload freight rates. (3) Export freight rate: The export freight rate applies to goods transported from stations on the main and branch lines from Nügu Kou to Jinan to the Jiao'ao area. It is the lowest price rate for full carload freight rates. Among the above three types of freight rates, the first type (inland freight rate) is the most expensive, the import freight rate is the second most expensive, and the export freight rate is the lowest. Taking the inland freight rate as a unit, the percentage rates can be listed as follows: Freight rates: Inland, Import, Export. Ratios: 100, 92.5, 7. It can be seen from the above table that the meaning of the freight rates set by the Germans is that inland transportation is entirely for self-trade between Chinese people, and high freight rates are charged to hinder the economic development of the inland people. Imports are all goods sold by foreigners to our country, and if the freight rate is too high, the sales will be sluggish, so it is lower than the inland freight rate. As for exports, most of them are raw materials, because our country's manufacturing is not developed and foreign countries need raw materials very much, so special incentives are given to reduce freight rates. Its unfairness is obvious. The current Jiaolu authorities, in view of this, have fundamentally revised the previous freight rates and formulated a graded freight rate in accordance with the Ministry's graded commodity table. It has been decided to implement and charge freight rates in accordance with the new regulations starting from July 1st of this year. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Electric Light Company Experiences Labor Strike</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Workers at the Xiamen Electric Light Company requested a pay raise, submitting their request for negotiation with the company on May 4th. After a long period without resolution, the workers reduced their demands to six conditions, including a monthly pay raise of six yuan per person and improved treatment. On the 4th of this month, the Siming County 指委會 ( 指導委員會, Guidance Committee) convened a labor-management arbitration meeting. Representatives from the Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the Military Headquarters were present. Worker representative Dong Jixu stated that the monthly wages of the workers were low, with the lowest being fifteen yuan and the highest only sixty-five yuan. Compared to the wages in Gulangyu, which ranged from twenty-four yuan to one hundred and twenty-five yuan, the difference was too great. The cost of living was high, and without a pay raise, they could not maintain their livelihoods, hence the request for a uniform monthly raise of six yuan. The company representative stated that the company had not made a profit in recent years, and shareholders had not received dividends for several years, making it difficult to agree. They finally agreed to an increase of two or three yuan, subject to the board of directors' decision the following day. The workers considered this unsatisfactory and announced a strike that evening. The Military Headquarters advised the workers to maintain order overnight, and the Military Headquarters would reconvene the meeting the next day to mediate. The workers agreed. At 1:00 PM on the 5th, the Military Headquarters convened a meeting. Party representative Zhang Fuyan, Military Headquarters representative Yang Tingshu, and representatives from the County Government were present. The workers' representative was still Dong Jixu, and the employers' representatives were Chen Yaokun, Sun Shizan, and Huang Shijin. The workers' representatives lowered their demand to an increase of five yuan per person, but the employers still insisted on three yuan. Finally, the Military Headquarters arbitrated at four yuan. The workers agreed to an increase of five yuan for those with monthly salaries of thirty yuan or less, and four yuan for those above thirty yuan. The employers argued that the second condition, which stipulated an annual pay raise of five yuan per worker, and the sixth condition, which prohibited the dismissal of workers without cause, would result in: (1) an increasing burden each year that the company would not be able to bear after several years; and (2) the company losing control over its personnel, and the engineers losing their authority to direct the workers. They insisted these conditions were unacceptable. They further stated that the company's capital was nine hundred thousand yuan, and last year's profit was ninety thousand yuan, a yield of only one percent per week. This year, they added a boiler, costing ten thousand yuan, and replaced electric poles and wires, also costing ten thousand yuan. They also needed to incur debts of over ten thousand yuan. An excessive pay raise would be beyond their capabilities. As a result, the mediation failed. The workers went on strike that evening, but as the workers left the factory, seven people were detained by the marines sent by the Military Headquarters to oversee and maintain the generator room and guard the electric poles and wires. Therefore, the streetlights were still on last night. It is heard that the authorities are still mediating today in the hope of an early resolution. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Prosecution Initiated in the Wutong Tragedy in Xiamen</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Following the sinking of the Wutong ferry in Xiamen, which resulted in the drowning of one hundred and eighty-nine passengers, and after fervent assistance from the various county Party Headquarters and civil groups in southern Fujian, the relatives of the deceased, represented by Su Linzai and others, have filed civil and criminal lawsuits with the Siming District Court. The legal documents were drafted by the pro bono legal team for the tragedy. The civil portion was submitted to the court on the 5th of this month, and the criminal portion will be submitted to the prosecutor's office shortly. The civil complaint is recorded as follows: (Plaintiffs: Su Linzai, etc., residing at Nanchun Station, Guoyuan Road; Defendants: Chen Youcai, Xue Yutian, Zeng Guoban, Chen Riming, Ke Keming, Lin Zhenming, Cai Jinglian, Lin Zhizhong, Feng Kairang, Chen Yaokun, Lin Zhichi, Ye Picheng, Qian Wenxian, etc., directors of Su Linzai, etc., residing at Meirengong.) One hundred and eighty-nine relatives, including men, women, children, and the elderly, boarded the 全禾 (Quanhe) Automobile Company's ferry at Shui'ao at 5:00 PM on April 10th, intending to cross to Wutong from Xiamen. The ship broke apart and sank midstream, and all passengers on board, except for the twenty-odd people who were rescued, drowned in Wutong harbor. One hundred and sixty-five bodies have been recovered, and it is certain that there are still twenty-four bodies either washed out to sea or trapped inside the ferry. Although there is no trace, there are reports from relatives and ticket stubs that can be investigated. The reason for the disaster is that the ferry had been dilapidated and unsafe for sailing for a long time. Despite warnings in the newspapers and objections from passengers, the company ignored them. The ferry also carried more than double the limit set by customs (customs limit of eighty-five people). Everyone knew it was dangerous to overload a dilapidated ship, but the crew dared to force passengers to board. Although many requested to split the journey into two trips or hire a sailboat to tow them, they were refused. All of these actions show a deliberate disregard for human life. The criminal aspect has been reported to the prosecutor's office in accordance with the law. Since the company deliberately sailed a dilapidated ship, resulting in the death of one hundred and eighty-nine people, their civil liability for compensation cannot be ignored. It is known that the passengers on the ferry included merchants carrying funds to purchase goods, school teachers and students, and people moving or visiting relatives in Xiamen. Therefore, based on their identities, the compensation value varies, with some being worth tens of thousands of yuan and others worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. Now, setting the minimum compensation amount at twenty thousand yuan per person, the total compensation for one hundred and eighty-nine people should be three million seven hundred and eighty thousand yuan. The litigation costs for these three million seven hundred and eighty thousand yuan are considerable. The dead are gone, and the living have no means of support. If the relatives of the deceased are forced to bear the expenses, their families will be impoverished. In such circumstances, it is necessary to apply for assistance. As for the loss of personal belongings of the deceased, we will file a separate lawsuit to recover the amount after investigation. We hereby urgently request your honorable court to investigate, approve, and order the defendants to jointly compensate three million seven hundred and eighty thousand silver yuan. We also humbly request you decide to approve litigation assistance. (Deepest gratitude for convenience.)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandit Forces in Western Fujian Are Already Exhausted</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Joint Office of the Civil Defense Corps of the Five Counties in Western Fujian recently announced the anti-communist situation as follows: (1) According to a report from Lin Tianteng, the head of the Bafang Civil Defense Corps in Zhangping County, the corps, responding to the demands of the people in Baisha and Xipu, led troops on the evening of the 27th and arrived at Puying early on the 28th. Catching the bandits off guard, they killed five communist soldiers on the spot and seized fourteen assorted rifles. They then attacked Baisha, where the communist soldier Lin Qingbiao led bandits in stubborn resistance. After hours of fierce fighting, they killed twelve communist soldiers on the spot and seized twenty-six assorted rifles. The two locations have been temporarily cleared. As for Longyan, many communist soldiers have moved towards Tingzhou. (2) Bandit suppression operations have been ongoing in Fushi and Longtan for several days. (3) The Shizhong Security Team coordinated with the Engineer Battalion to besiege Yang Fang's bandit gang on the 29th. After a day of fierce fighting, several bandits were killed, and three government soldiers were injured. (4) In the bandit areas of Shangjin and Fengyi in Yongding, traffic has been cut off by the Third Corps. There is no rice in the towns and villages. Bandits and residents alike are in a state of panic and have been searching civilian homes for rice, which is being distributed. The price of rice is about eight catties per yuan. (5) News from Xiayang: The communist bandits attacked Dabu again but were defeated. Several hundred bandits retreated to Xiayang, where they stayed for one day before retreating to Canghushan in Pinghe to flank Dabu. (6) The local communist forces in Yongfu originally had four squads and one company. Because the people could not bear the abuse of the bandits, the squads became aware of the situation and unanimously turned against the communists. On the 29th, they surrounded and confiscated over seventy rifles from the company, reorganized into the Republic of China and stationed in various key locations, awaiting assistance. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Important News from Beiping</h3>
<p>Before Yan Xishan arrived in Shijiazhuang, he had agreed with Feng Yuxiang to meet between Xinxiang and Zhangde. However, after Yan arrived in Shijiazhuang, Feng requested a slight postponement of the meeting due to foot problems. He said that if he recovered within a few days, he would force himself to meet in Baquan. Therefore, Yan is still in Shijiazhuang, and Feng is in a town twenty-five miles from Zhengzhou. He receives necessary guests in Zhengzhou. Shanxi Province has agreed to allocate 500,000 yuan in military expenses to the Northwest Army each month: 200,000 on the 15th, 100,000 on the 25th, and 200,000 at the end of the month. The cost of grain procured by Shanxi will be deducted from this amount. The flour sacks must be returned for reuse. After the news of the fall of Guide arrived, Yan telegraphed Feng, asking him to decide on a plan. Feng replied that he had ordered Sun Liangcheng to lead four divisions to assist and that Sun was familiar with the situation in western Shandong and Shangqiu and would be able to resist. The retreat of the Northwest Army near Lingying and Shangqiao was due to the military situation in Shangqiu. The Pinghan Railway Bureau requested a division of Fan Zhongxiu's troops. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a total of 3,000 yuan, with Zhu Hexiang advancing over 1,000 yuan. After the advance was repaid, only a little over 1,000 yuan in public funds was left. Zhu introduced someone to borrow money, but it was rejected by the Shanxi Finance Department and not carried out. Some time ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to send a telegram to the League of Nations, but because the original telegram had too many words and would cost over 300 yuan, the text was reduced to one-third, costing over 100 yuan to send. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is experiencing great financial difficulties. Shu Shuangquan (of the Banner people) in the Beiping Office has advanced several thousand yuan, but the funds have not yet been received. Taiyuan issued 5,000 yuan in cash to important party figures, including staff, with each person receiving only over 200 yuan. The Taiyuan military delegation is very cold towards the Party Committee and has sent six telegrams urging the rapid formation of a government, with the real intention of sharing the workload. If the delay continues, the colleagues will suffer from travel expenses and have no way to develop. In fact, Yan is not eager to establish a government. Once a government is established, the military, government, and party will demand even more money, which Shanxi cannot afford. The so-called indecision in party affairs is just an excuse. Some time ago, the Taiyuan delegation requested the establishment of a War Zone Political Affairs Committee so that financial and civil affairs personnel could be appointed wherever they advanced. However, Yan did not advocate for this because of the many malpractices and the ease with which it would provoke the resentment of miscellaneous troops. Therefore, the proposal was shelved.

<h3>Financial Crisis in Harbin</h3>
<p>Gold Notes and Rubles Both Increase in Price; Harbin Notes’ Influence Declines Daily</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The financial market here has been in great turmoil for days. The price of Japanese gold notes has risen, with five jiao able to exchange for one Harbin note. The listed price of the fictitious gold ruble has also increased steadily, with each yuan valued at two yuan, one jiao, four fen in Harbin notes, about 15% higher than a week ago. The market and businesses are stressed by these two major forces. Coupled with the hurdle of settling accounts at the Dragon Boat Festival, they have been drained of vitality. Today, after the festival, more than 37 stores of the fourth class and below in the business district are unable to sustain themselves and have reported closure to the General Chamber of Commerce. Da Luo Xin and Tong Fa Long, the giants of the Harbin grocery business, were indebted to over one million yuan for the festival settlement. After several discussions by the shareholders during the festival, they nearly closed down. Although the market has now reopened, daily sales are less than 3,000 yuan, with the daily losses difficult to sustain for long.</p>
<p>Also, this year’s gold rush and the slump in silver prices, and the implementation of the printed Harbin notes, provide a very rare opportunity to restrict issuance internally. Therefore, in the past six months, the exchange rate has repeatedly fallen from 48 yuan, falling to no more than 17 yuan for Tianjin and 18 yuan for Shanghai. Although the market is stable and the Harbin note itself is not convertible, its price is now equivalent to cash. Logically, if the main currency were so stable, commerce could flourish. Who would have known that, operating in the sphere of foreign currency, the entrenched influence of Japanese gold notes would still drag the Harbin notes down? When Zhang Huanxiang was the Special District Administrator, he issued a strict proclamation banning the use of Japanese gold notes. Although the result was less effective, it ultimately failed to eradicate the deep-rooted problem. Therefore, after Zhang left, gold notes continued to expand their influence in the Harbin market through Japanese goods as a medium. In the past year, Japanese gold notes have restored their old appearance as the currency for transactions in the Daoli District. Observing that the gold rush is surging, the price of gold notes has also increased. Currently, its influence has spread throughout northern Manchuria. Although the authorities are well aware of this, they have no good way to remedy the situation. If this continues, the price may not stop at half price (one Harbin note exchanging for five jiao in gold notes).</p>
<p>In addition to the harm done by gold notes, the fictitious gold ruble of the East Railway is also wreaking havoc. Since the gold rush, the price of the gold ruble has increased from 1.75 Harbin notes per yuan to 2.14 Harbin notes per yuan. The exchange rate for freight has also increased from 1.07 yuan to 1.45 yuan. Two days ago, the Railway Bureau ordered the exchange rate to be changed to 1.55 Harbin notes per yuan. The last time the price increased, Harbin merchants protested desperately, but without result. This time, the exchange rate has changed again. Although the merchants have wailed and pleaded, those who argue argue, and those who raise raise. Our authorities have turned a deaf ear. Therefore, the Chinese merchants in northern Manchuria are now no more than agents for foreigners. They have no control over their own profits and losses. If there is no remedy, it is feared that all Chinese merchants will go bankrupt in a few years. (3rd) Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Head of the Anti-Smuggling Team Suppresses Bandits. In the villages and towns south of Pudong, banditry is rampant. Cases of kidnapping and robbery occur almost every day. This is because the bandit leader, Taibao Ashu, is entrenched and wreaking havoc. Pan Baozhong, the head of the fourth detachment of the Shanyang Anti-Smuggling Team, recently joined forces with Xu Pucheng, the head of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police Team, to encircle and suppress the bandits. Xu took a warship to guard the river mouth on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, while Pan led his team to Qianjiawei and Liujiawei, the hideouts of the bandits (Taibao Ashu's hometown). However, the bandits had already fled after hearing the news. After searching the households, they arrested Xiang Ajin, also known as Ajiang, a sampan boatman, in Jinshanwei Town. Pan personally escorted him back to the county on the 9th for investigation. It is heard that Xiang led Taibao Ashu out to sea from Jinshanwei by sampan. Head Pan is still investigating the bandits' whereabouts, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Planning to establish a domestic goods market. The county government convened a meeting of various groups on the 9th to prepare for the organization of a domestic goods market. County Magistrate Jin chaired the meeting. It was decided that Zhou Heyun would be appointed as the executive director of the preparatory committee, which would be divided into four sections. The market site was set at the prison, and the houses would be renovated. The county chamber of commerce would temporarily provide office space. The Jiang Erchang case announced a verdict. Jiang Erchang of Tianmashan was charged with illegally arresting Zhang Youshu and detaining him at home. After being arrested, he was found to be privately storing military weapons. After a clear investigation by the county government, it was proposed on the 9th to sentence Jiang Erchang to two months in prison and a fine of 280 yuan. Jiang, who is currently in custody, is seriously ill and has requested temporary medical parole. Robbery in Baiyu Village, Xiaokunshan. On the evening of the 7th, more than a dozen bandits armed with weapons came to Baiyu Village, Xiaokunshan Township. They rampaged through various farmers' homes, robbing them. More than a dozen families were robbed, with the Lu family suffering the greatest losses. The whole village was robbed of about fifty-odd stones of white rice and clothing, etc., suffering heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the Rural Teachers Extension Department. The Jiading, Kunshan, and Qingpu County Public Rural Teachers' School has established an extension department in the remaining buildings of the Zhenchuan School. Inside, there are departments such as a rural clinic, a public library, a reading room, a recreation room, a music room, a public theater, a public night school, and a public teahouse. The opening ceremony was held the day before yesterday (the 8th). Chen Zhongda, the County Magistrate of Jiading, Yang, the Director of Education, Pang Shusheng, the County Magistrate of Kunshan, Pan, the Director of Education, and Shao Rugan, the design committee member, and more than ten people attended the ceremony. At 2:00 PM, the flag was raised to open the ceremony. Wu Wenkui, the principal of the rural teachers' school, reported on the organization process and implementation methods. Guests then gave speeches, followed by music, dance, and other entertainment. The villagers who came to watch were very enthusiastic. The district heads of the two counties are appointed separately. The Anting Security Corps of this county was originally jointly operated by Kunshan and Jiading, with expenses borne by the two counties. Currently, the chief corps director appointed the eighth district head as the concurrent district corps director in accordance with the County Security Corps Organization Law. The people of Kunshan County believe that this measure seems to make the corps unique to Jiading County. To avoid leaving them in the lurch, they requested that Deputy Chief Fang postpone his handover. Yesterday (the 8th), when County Magistrates Chen and Pang came to An to participate in the opening ceremony of the rural teachers' extension department, they publicly recommended Yang Jiwei, the third district head of the county, as a representative to state the above situation. After consultation between the two county magistrates, it was agreed that Yang, the district head of Kunshan County, would also serve as the concurrent district corps director, jointly responsible. In addition, a chief commander will be elected locally to lead the various corps members in assuming defense duties.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Major Bloodshedding Incident in the Northern District. Shi Changlong (Desheng), a pot mender at No. 74 Guanku Lane, Suzhou City, and his concubine, Ms. Chen, have lived together for more than twenty years. Shi is a member of the Bao Li Education Society and the director of the Zhishengtang. Currently, he has accumulated some savings. Shi has a friend named Lu Xiaocun. When Shi opened a noodle shop, Lu served as a partner. The day before yesterday, Lu came to the city from the countryside and stayed at Shi's house that night. On this day, Shi went to a church to participate in the establishment of the church on the 9th. Unexpectedly, at midnight that night, Lu suddenly knocked on Shi's wife's door, asking to borrow money. When he failed, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a kitchen knife, kicked open Shi's wife's door, and dragged Ms. Chen off the bed, hacking wildly at her with the knife. Ms. Chen screamed in pain. Cheng Xinggao, who lived with Shi, was startled by the sound and went to persuade him, but was also slashed in the head. Zhang Amao, the cook, also went to stop him and was also slashed, but the injuries were minor. At the same time, Ji Arong, Shi Changhai, and others also went to stop him and were also slashed. At that time, the whole family was horrified. Then, Shi and Ms. Chen's adopted daughter rushed to Taohuawu to sound the alarm. The police arrived and arrested the murderer, Lu Xiaocun, along with Shi's disciple, Wang Jinshan, and took them to the district police station. They sent the seriously injured Shi, Ms. Chen, and Cheng Xinggao to Bu Xiong Hospital for treatment. Ji Arong rushed to Huguan to bring Shi Changlong back to take care of everything. After being taken to the police station, the murderer Lu Xiaocun confessed that Wang Jinshan had brought the kitchen knife. Lu and Wang were both taken into custody. Sheng, a police officer, went to Bu Xiong Hospital to inquire about the condition of the injured. The murderers were transferred to the local court for investigation.

Sun, a widow from the Qingshan Bay area (Fourth District) of the Kaiyuan Township of the County Bureau, is forty-odd years old and has one son and two daughters. Her son died of illness after getting married in previous years. In order to continue the family line, Sun took in Yan, a man from Jingjiang, as a tenant. Recently, Yan, seeing that Sun's youngest daughter (thirteen years old) was somewhat attractive, harbored desires. The day before yesterday, he sneaked into her room in the middle of the night and held her down, raping her. The daughter screamed in pain. Her mother heard the sound and went to check. She saw the girl lying on the bed, unable to get up, with severe injuries to her lower body. Afterwards, Yan knew that he had caused trouble and immediately fled without a trace. Sun is currently searching in various ways in order to arrest him and bring him to justice in the county. Reporting the dereliction of duty and embezzlement by the head of the Fifth Sub-Bureau. Zhou Yangzhao, the head of the Fifth Public Security Sub-Bureau of Jiangyin Lane outside the North Gate of Xiyi, is of base character. Since taking office, he has colluded with employees Yuan Guifang and patrol officer Huang Degui to extort money from the people. He arbitrarily imposes fines on cases of gambling and other offenses, but does not issue receipts, pocketing the money himself. Those who have suffered are afraid of his power and dare not speak out. Recently, Zou Tingliang, a standing committee member of the Second District Party Headquarters and the Third District Branch, stated that the head of the sub-bureau, Zhou Yangzhao, is guilty of dereliction of duty and embezzlement, abusing his power and employing henchmen to extort from the poor, which is truly illegal. Therefore, he specially submitted the resolution of the twelfth plenary meeting of all party members of the branch to the Second District Party Headquarters, requesting that it be forwarded to the County Party Rectification Committee and the County Government to dismiss Zhou Yangzhao, the head of the Fifth Sub-Bureau, in order to warn against corruption.

<h3>Letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Film Censorship Committee</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: I have recently read the Nanjing dispatch in your newspaper on June 9th, entitled "(Shanghai Film Censorship Postponed)," which stated, "(The Executive Yuan ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to instruct the Shanghai Film Censorship Committee to postpone the implementation of film censorship before the central government has established unified film censorship procedures, in order to avoid disputes)." I am extremely surprised by this. On the 6th of this month, this committee received Order No. 322 from the Municipal Government, which forwarded Instruction No. 2101 from the Executive Yuan, stating, "(The committee's request to implement measures to ban the import and export of Chinese and foreign films is currently being discussed by the Ministries of Finance, Interior, and Education to establish unified censorship procedures. Before these unified procedures are established, the request to implement measures to ban the import and export of Chinese and foreign films should be postponed)." The original order only referred specifically to banning the import and export of films, but your newspaper mistakenly interpreted it as "(Shanghai Film Censorship Postponed)," which is completely inaccurate. I am deeply concerned that this will confuse the public, mislead public opinion, and hinder the committee's work. Therefore, I am writing to you to request that you investigate and promptly correct this error. Thank you for your attention. Sincerely, Shanghai Special Municipality Film Censorship Committee, June 9th.</p>
<h3>Letter from Li Zuomin, Chief of the Second Branch of the Gaoyou Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: I have recently read in the local correspondence column on page 3 of your newspaper on the 6th of this month that the Chief of the Second Branch of the Gaoyou Public Security Bureau is "doing whatever he pleases, abandoning his post out of fear of punishment, and fleeing." I am extremely shocked by this. Since I, Zuomin, took office as the Chief of the Public Security Branch more than a month ago, I have repeatedly resigned due to a lack of funding for the branch, but my resignation has not been approved. This time, I resolutely went to the town to petition the government for a transfer. This was a forced decision based on verifiable and provable facts, not an escape out of fear of punishment. The allegations in your newspaper are completely fabricated. Therefore, I respectfully request that you make a correction to protect my reputation. Sincerely, Li Zuomin, June 7th, 19. Sports</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Chinese Football Team's Failure at the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>(Xu Minhui)</p>
<h3>(1) The China-Philippines Match</h3>
<p>The Philippine team was not very strong in this Far Eastern Games football competition. They suffered a crushing defeat in their first match against Japan, with a score of seven to two. In addition, our team's reputation had already spread, causing the Philippine team to lose heart and lack fighting spirit. Therefore, the ball was often in the Philippine team's area during this match. After the start of the game, our team frequently attacked the Philippine goal. Their goalkeeper was very skilled and often saved the ball. Furthermore, the assistance of their right full-back made it difficult for our team to score despite repeated shots on goal. At times, the Philippine team launched sudden counterattacks, catching our defense off guard and creating dangerous situations. Fortunately, goalkeeper Zhou dived and saved the ball, but it was a close call. Our team's strategy focused on attacking the left wing, forcing the opponent to anticipate and defend, then taking advantage of the opening to cross the ball. Therefore, the center forward and the two wingers often had opportunities to score. In the first half, our team won with a score of three to zero. Although we won the second half with a score of two to zero, our performance was not very impressive. Our passing was inaccurate, and we were often attacked by the Filipinos. Fortunately, our inside forwards and goalkeeper were able to defend the danger. It is said that the reason for this was that they were saving their energy for the match against Japan.</p>
<h3>(2) The China-Japan Match</h3>
<p>As for the China-Japan match, our country actually drew with a score of three to three. Informed observers believe that since the Far Eastern Games began, this was the worst performance by our football team. Even the players themselves believe that any team selected from the Lehua, Nanhua, and Zhonghua teams would have performed better than this team. The reasons for this failure are threefold: personnel selection issues, Wu Jinquan, Lin Yuying, and Bao Jiaping could not go. Li Huitang and Sun Enjing had foot injuries and could not participate. Only thirteen players remained. (When Li Ning played, Feng Yunhu replaced him. When Chen Jiaqiu played, Sun Jin replaced him as the right forward, and Ye Beihua as the left forward. Chen Guangyao played on the left wing.) I will list their positions during the match below for the reader's study. (Feng Yunhu) (Chen Wo Yao) Li Ning Chen Zhenhe (Ye Beihua) Sun Jinshun Zhou Xianyan Huang Ruihua Dai Linjing Sun Xiangshun (Chen Jiaqiu) Li Tiansheng Liang Xianzhan Cao Guicheng Overall team assessment: Our team's teamwork was very poor, especially between the forwards and midfielders. The two did not connect well and often complained and argued, leading to disunity. Furthermore, there was no one to take control. It was fortunate that they did not fail completely. How could they have hoped to win? Individual skills: During the match between China and Japan, only Li Tiansheng was lively, brave, and adaptable. The rest were mostly slow and unresponsive. Although the ground was slightly wet at the time, the Japanese players moved freely as if nothing was wrong. When the two sides fought, the ball was often taken away by the Japanese players even when it was close to us. I don't know if this was due to diet, rest, or practice, or if it was due to fear or fear of injury. The real reason is unknown. Refereeing issues: It goes without saying whether the Japanese football referee was biased or not. In one game, our team was penalized more than ten times. The referee called offsides many times. It can be said to open the record for football games. I don't know if the referee didn't understand the rules of football, or if the people of the Empire had the right to change and not execute the rules. When asked about the official football rules, the Football Committee said that there was no way to find them in Japan, and none of our staff, athletes, or representatives brought these rules. Alas, diplomacy failed, how can it be avoided? The Far Eastern athletes from Pingjin, Shenyang, and Harbin were feasted in Shenyang.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Welcomed Zhang Xueliang with Encouragement</h3>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) Twenty-one athletes from Pingjin, Shenyang, and Harbin who attended the Far Eastern Games returned to the country at 1:00 PM on the 4th. Jin Enqi, Chairman of the Shenyang Chamber of Commerce, Ji Jinsheng and Wang Huayi, Chairmen of the Provincial Education Association, Zhang Yunleng and Liu Yulun, Secretaries of the YMCA, and Huang Yiran all arrived at the station early to welcome them. After the athletes got off the train and rested briefly in the waiting room, they took cars to the Beiling Villa, where Wang Huayi introduced them to Zhang Xueliang. Zhang made a brief speech to the athletes, repeatedly emphasizing the importance of personal cultivation and rigorous training. The athletes elected Dong Shouyi, leader of Pingjin, to deliver a response, saying that the Chinese Far Eastern athletes had failed technically, but they could be proud of their spirit (referring to morality). He said that with the enthusiastic promotion of the authorities, everyone would work together to improve technically at the next Games, so that they would not only receive spiritual comfort as they do today. After Dong finished speaking, all the athletes paid their respects to Zhang, who then spoke briefly with each athlete and took a photo before dispersing. The athletes from Pingjin and Harbin initially planned to leave immediately, but were persuaded by local organizations to stay for one night. At approximately 6:00 PM, ten athletes from Pingjin, including Chen Shengkui, Liu Guan Jun, Wang Yuzeng, Huang Shushen, Kang Xizhi, Zhou Zhaoyuan, Tang Baokun, Liu Jianchang, and Yao Enhan, five athletes from Harbin, including Liu Jingzhen, Wu Meixian, Sun Guiyun, and Fu Baolu, and six athletes from Shenyang, including Zhang Lingjia, Lang Daikui, Liu Changchun, Xiao Dinghua, and Jiang Yunlong, were invited by organizations such as the Provincial Department of Education, the Education Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Agricultural Association, the YMCA, the Northeastern University, and the Tongze Middle School for Men and Women, and the Third Middle School to hold a welcome meeting at the YMCA cafeteria. Liaoning athletes and staff from the National Games were also invited to accompany them, with over a hundred guests in attendance. The meeting was presided over by Yan Yuheng, General Secretary of the YMCA, and began at 8:30 PM. Mr. Yan stood up and delivered a welcome speech, followed by speeches from Wu Jiaxiang, Director of the Department of Education, and Liu Fengzhu, Vice President of Northeastern University. Next, Ms. Huang, the female instructor of the Harbin athletes, reported that the failure was expected, but that the difference in skill level was much greater than five years. If they wanted to remedy the situation, the country, schools, and athletes must work together to be effective. Zhang Lingjia then reported on the Taihui situation, which was largely the same as reported in the newspapers, so it will not be repeated. Finally, Dong Shouyi reported that the Chinese side had made great progress in this Far Eastern Games, that the athletes' spirit was still united, and that the economy was also very abundant. As for the failure of the results, although the strength of each other was far apart, it was also due to the unfairness of the judges. It is hoped that physical education in the future will have perseverance and effort, and will not be exposed for ten days of cold, so that the future will be fortunate. The banquet for the athletes was dismissed at 9:30 PM. The male athletes from various places stayed at the YMCA, while the female athletes stayed at the Tongze Girls' Middle School. The Pingjin athletes were scheduled to leave at 9:00 AM on the 5th, while the Harbin athletes were scheduled to leave at 3:00 PM (June 6th).</p>

<p>Fighting Minli at 4:00 PM today at the track and field at Father Lao's Road. The Guangdong Provincial First Women's Normal School played its first match yesterday, the 8th, against the Wuben team, but lost to the Wuben team by one to two due to long absence from the games and unfamiliarity with the sport. It is said that the school's coach, in view of the reasons for the failure, played against another school. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the school's coach led the players from Guangzhou and the school's athletes returning from the Far Eastern Games to the Sports Association's court to practice and change the positions and formations of the players in preparation for the battle with the Minli Girls' School team at the Chinese Track and Field Field at 4:00 PM this afternoon.

<h3>Jiaotong University Beats Jinan University 14-2</h3>
<p>The Jiangda Sports Association's baseball championship game between Jiaotong University and Jinan University was held for the first time yesterday at the Chinese Baseball Field. It began at 3:00 PM. Jiaotong University's players are more experienced and their lineup is orderly. An Yuansheng's pitcher is quite outstanding, and Chen Pu's shortstop is also very good. Jinan University seems to be slightly inferior. Pitcher Liang Shutang is far inferior to Jiaotong University's An Yuansheng. Chen Zhenhe, the shortstop, was transferred to the position, but it was not effective. Overall, Chen Zhenhe is the best talent in Jinan University. Jiaotong University also has a better grasp of the batting aspect. Both sides made many mistakes and there were few exciting performances. After seven innings, Jiaotong University won by 14 to 2. The referee was Zhou Jiaqi. The scores for each inning are as follows: Jinan 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 | 2 points Jiaotong 1 1 7 5 0 0 A | 14 points</p>

<h3>Juying Beats John 7-4</h3>

First, it defeated Gongda, then Tongji. Yesterday (Sunday), it defeated St. John's University by a score of seven to four. It is said that because the players on both sides were not present at the same time during the competition, the competition was held twice to determine the outcome.

<h3>Random Notes on Education in Japan (2)</h3>
<p>(Hu Shuyi Japan Correspondence) Three days of life at sea, in addition to listening to music concerts and four meals (in addition to three meals in the morning, noon, and evening on the ship, there is a snack at 4:00 PM), all you can do is sleep. I usually reduce my sleeping time due to being busy, but I make up for it here, which is also a pleasure. At 5:30 AM on the 15th, the ship arrived at Kobe Port, and there was an inspection of luggage by customs officers, questioning by the police department, and a physical examination by doctors. It took about an hour and a half to complete the process, and the luggage was handed over to the coolies and transported to the First Building. The Japanese coolies all wear red hats, are serious and polite. Compared with the Chinese coolies who compete for passengers' luggage, the difference in level is so great that this point alone gives us a good impression. The First Building is a hotel opened by Cantonese people in Nanjing Town, Kobe. Because they are Chinese, they treat us very warmly. After dinner, I went to Kanacho to see the Nunobiki Falls. There is a distinction between male and female waterfalls. The female waterfall is 13 feet high and the male waterfall is 25 feet high. The water rushes down freely from the cliff, and the sound and color of the flying foam are beautiful. I admired the magnificent scenery. The surrounding old trees are lush, the cliffs are strange and steep, and the seclusion is lovely. Then I went to Suwa Mountain Park to visit. The zoo is the best, with tigers, leopards, lions, and elephants. Visitors buy food with money and throw it to them. All kinds of animals use the Honor System, with no deception. The level of the citizens can be seen. After the tour, I returned to the hotel to pick up my luggage and took an overnight train to Tokyo. It took 14 hours on the train. I got up the next morning and learned that the train I was on was running on electricity and did not use coal. Electric wires and poles could be seen everywhere between the countryside fields and village houses on both sides of the railway. The development of Japan's electricity industry can be imagined. At 8:40 AM on the 16th, I arrived at Tokyo Station. Student Supervisor Ke Renxue and Zhang Menglin, Section Chief of the Superintendent Department, came to the station. After a long separation, we shook hands and greeted each other. I felt convenient to have a familiar person to guide me. In the afternoon, accompanied by Mr. Zhang, I went to the Japan-China Association. The Acting Director of the Association, Utsubori Ibun, and the Managing Director, Yamai Kakutaro, met me. The Japan-China Association is an organization established by Japanese people to be friendly to Chinese people. They do their best to entertain any Chinese people who come to Japan for investigation and visit. It is said that the organizers are retired diplomats and some capitalists. Their intentions can be seen. After discussing it, we decided to stay at the association when we were investigating in Tokyo. Due to time constraints, I decided to investigate in Tokyo and the surrounding areas for two weeks before going to other states (May 17th). For the convenience of our visit, we asked the Student Supervision Office to transfer a student to be our translator. Mr. Wang hired Mao Chengpeng, a graduate student in the Education Department of Tokyo High School. He graduated from Hiroshima High School. At 9:00 AM on the 19th, accompanied by Mr. Mao, I went to the Tokyo Municipal Education Bureau. The Chief of the General Affairs Section and the Chief of the Supervisory Section met me and talked in detail about the organization and administration of the Education Bureau. The main points are summarized as follows: The Education Bureau is divided into three departments: Academic Affairs, Social Education, and Supervision. Academic Affairs is divided into four sections: General Affairs, Management, Teaching Affairs, and School Health. Social Education is divided into two sections: Adult Education and Cultural Facilities. Supervision is divided into two sections: Cultural and Staff. In addition, there is an Academic Affairs Committee that serves as an advisory body to the Mayor and the Education Bureau. It is composed of six members of the Municipal Council, three members of the Municipal Council, four members elected by the citizens, and two teachers from municipal elementary schools. The annual income of the Tokyo Municipal Education Fund is about 1,539,700 Japanese gold. The annual income of the education funds in each school district is about 4,889,700. There are currently 203 municipal elementary schools, with a total of 4,122 classes, 4,928 faculty members, and 206,947 children. In Tokyo, there are many day and night schools, all of which are for remedial purposes. Most of the students who attend night school are poor children who have to work during the day due to living conditions and have to study at night. Each night class is three hours long and graduates in three years. Their level is of course not as good as that of ordinary elementary school graduates. There were originally 11 poor people's schools in the city for poor children to attend. Now, in order to break the social class concept of rich and poor, this system has been abolished. Instead, the municipal government allocates an annual subsidy of 97,000 yuan to distribute to poor children for school fees. The method of supervision is that the supervisor who has graduated from a higher normal school and has served as a principal of an elementary school inspects the school administration, while the rest adopt a departmental supervision system. The bureau pays considerable attention to health education and stipulates that elementary schools hold physical examinations twice a year in spring and autumn. Each school has a resident school doctor and a nurse. Since the Tokyo earthquake, the elementary school reconstruction plan has been renovating the municipal elementary schools. 109 new school buildings have been completed, and the rest are still in progress. When asked about the education policy, the answer was that it is roughly based on the regulations of the Ministry of Education and that special emphasis is placed on civic education and practical life. After graduating from elementary school, 60% of the graduates go on to higher education, and the rest go to vocational schools. The Tokyo Municipal Education Bureau is a Western-style building that combines Japanese style. It is very clean and tidy. In addition to hanging words of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country in the reception room, there are no other educational statistical tables. The point of not emphasizing surface decoration or other reasons cannot be known. At 1:30 PM, I went to the Tokyo Prefectural School Affairs Department to visit. Higo Morinuma, a supervising official, met me and talked about the school affairs department being divided into four sections: 1. The Academic Affairs Section handles matters related to schools at all levels, libraries, art galleries, education funds, and youth groups and youth training centers. 2. The Social Affairs and Temple Affairs Section handles matters related to religion, shrines, monks, conscription, historical sites, and scenic spots. 3. The Social Affairs Section handles matters related to child protection, poor people's relief, unemployment relief, housing associations, and other social undertakings. 4. The Health Section handles matters related to infectious disease prevention, waste disposal, doctors, midwives, and health classes. In addition to kindergartens, elementary schools, and middle schools, the prefecture also has higher women's schools, vocational schools, and a prefectural men's normal school and a women's normal school. There are currently one supervising official, six supervisors, and three supervising staff. Next, we discussed the method of increasing teacher's salaries based on seniority. It is known that the first year of service for normal school graduates is 45 yuan per month for women and 55 yuan per month for men. After that, 5 yuan will be added for each year of service, up to 240 yuan. Elementary school teachers who have served for 15 years and retired will receive one-third of their monthly salary as a pension. For those who retire after 16 years of service, their pension will increase by 2 yuan per month. For those who retire after 17 years of service, their pension will increase by 4 yuan per month. The increase is progressive every year. Therefore, Japanese elementary school teachers are full of interest and take teaching as a lifelong career. Compared with the elementary school teachers in our country who change careers halfway, how different is the situation? There is also no regulation on increasing salaries based on seniority. Next, we discussed the issue of teacher training. It is known that normal education in Japan is independent and has a consistent system. Taking the Tokyo prefecture as an example, normal school students receive a monthly allowance of 13 yuan and 5 jiao for boys and 12 yuan and 9 jiao for girls in addition to being free of charge. Normal school graduates have an obligation to serve for four years. In addition, there is a two-part normal school, where graduates of secondary-level schools can study for a year and then serve for a year and a half after graduation. Normal education is very important to basic national education. Japan's progress in all aspects in recent years is attributed to the popularization of education, and the normal school graduates at all levels are directly responsible for popularizing education. Therefore, they attach importance to normal education as much as other important government affairs. Compared with the failure to realize compulsory education in our country and the fragmented nature of normal education, I cannot help but feel heavy.

<p>The Zhejiang Education Fund Will Be</p>
<h3>Distributed Before the Summer Vacation in May</h3>
<p>According to the Hangzhou National and Provincial Education Institution Directors' Joint Association, the Zhejiang Education Department has submitted a request to clear the expenses before June before the summer vacation. Director Chen believes that the situation is urgent and proposed it at the 317th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee on the 6th of this month for review and resolution. The decision was made to ask the Finance Department to allocate funds in advance, so that at least the expenses for May will be cleared before the summer vacation. The proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Hangzhou National and Provincial Education Institution Directors' Joint Association states: Upon investigation, the expenses of various educational institutions in the provincial capital cannot be paid on a monthly basis. During normal times, administrative expenses rely entirely on the misappropriation of student meal funds. At the end of each semester, teachers, students, and shops all come to demand payment. If preparations are not made in advance, it will be difficult to cope properly. Therefore, we request that you consider the precedent of the previous year and make arrangements in advance. Please issue the second half of March and the full amount for April before June 15, and clear the full amounts for May and June before the summer vacation so as to facilitate the conclusion and avoid difficulties. It is true that the delayed payment of expenses for various educational institutions is difficult to sustain, and since the summer vacation is the end of the semester, all accounts must be settled, and the need for expenses is even more urgent. Upon investigation, when the summer vacation was approaching last year, President Jiang of Zhejiang University requested that education expenses before the first half of July be cleared before July 5, which was resolved at the 234th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. The council's request this time is to follow the precedent and approve the clearance of expenses before June before the summer vacation, which is a practical necessity. The office also learned from various provincial schools that the circumstances of their difficulties are extremely urgent. All education expenses are requested to be cleared before the summer vacation until June. It is proposed to approve the proposal accordingly and respectfully request a public decision.</p>

The Municipal Works Bureau then planned and built a three-story new school building with a new structure for its solidity and beauty. The interior layout is also suitable for educational principles. Construction began at the end of November last year and was completed in May of this year after half a year. The school has scheduled the completion ceremony of the new building for the 10th of this month.

<h3>Party and State Dignitaries Mourn Ms. Luo Xizhen</h3>
<p>Tao Guoren, an employee of the Central Party Headquarters, Ms. Luo Xizhen, unfortunately fell into the water with the driver and the car while traveling to the pond on the side of the archway east of the Central Party Headquarters on the night of April 23. Details have been seen in various newspapers. However, whether Ms. Luo was a victim of the case has not been solved. Her husband, Mr. Feng Youzhen (currently a reporter for the Central News Agency), in addition to mourning his beloved wife, specially chose June 1 to set up a spiritual hall and hold a memorial service at the Wuzhou Park on Xuanwu Lake in Nanjing.</p>
<p>I recently obtained an obituary from Ms. Luo's friend, Ms. Chen, filled with mournful sounds. Mr. Feng respectfully wrote (Portrait of My Wife, Ms. Luo Xizhen) on his wife's portrait, with the inscription (Respectfully inscribed by Feng Youzhen after washing his hands, May 1, 19th year of the Republic). Many party and state dignitaries have elegies and eulogies, and especially those inscribed by He Yingqin and Chen Guofu are particularly meaningful and appropriate. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Thinking of her gentleness and beauty, she perished in the puddles. The party and the state are short of talent, how can we not mourn!) (Inscribed by He Yingqin)</p>
<p>(Opening up a new path should not compromise with the old ways. The coachman was ignorant and dragged people into the water and escaped privately. The heavy rain was pouring, and it was appropriate to go home early. Comrades came and went, but they didn't take precautions when they saw danger. Wrong, wrong, everyone was wrong. Alas, madam died unjustly in the pond. Who would not be saddened by her death with her ambitions? We should learn from the past and make up for our mistakes to comfort madam's spirit.) (Chen Guofu's eulogy)</p>
<p>In addition, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government wrote (The party and the state are gloomy). Li Jishen, who lives in seclusion in the capital, also has a eulogy and four seven-character quatrains attached. The eulogy of Zhang Wohua, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, expresses deep sorrow in his words:</p>
<p>(All night wind and rain, half an acre of pond, actually caused Cao Yuan's body to sink. It is still difficult to clarify the suspicious case. Huang Niao's song became a lament for the women's world.) (Three months of pregnancy, a pair of swallows competing, strange Qin Jia's intestines broken. Floating life is unlovable, the plain zither's strings are astringent, weeping in the empty boudoir.)</p>
<p>In addition to (Mourning Notice of My Wife, Ms. Luo Xizhen), the obituary also included Ms. Luo's posthumous work (The Advantages and Disadvantages of People's Livelihood Doctrine and Marxism). When people read the text and think of the person, they will lament the talent of the women's world even more.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Establishment of the Cangsheng Alumni Association Min Sun</h3>
<p>The Cangsheng Mingzhi University Alumni Association, initiated and organized by Zhou Shixun, Xia Fei, Jia Botao, etc., former alumni of Cangsheng Mingzhi University in Aili Garden, has been formally established. Last night at 6 o'clock, the establishment meeting ceremony was held at the Gongdelin Hall. More than 200 alumni attended, and many came from afar. The atmosphere was lively and interesting. They took their seats at 6 o'clock, and there were many more jokes. I will record them with a pen.</p>
<p>The organization of the school is different from other schools. All students of the school cannot leave the school on weekdays except for weddings and funerals, so the students are together day and night and have a close relationship. Since the dissolution, the students have been scattered due to life circumstances. Although a small number of students still reside in Shanghai, they cannot get a good opportunity to call old friends. The alumni association is considered an excellent opportunity by alumni from all over the world, and they have sent letters to register. Although not all of them were present that night, there were many who were not familiar with each other.</p>
<p>After taking their seats that night, the alumni all described their interesting stories at school. Zhang Ji said (Buying cakes over the wall) had a special flavor, but the students had to secretly buy fish and meat from the cook in order to adjust their tastes, and the bathroom was the place for delivery, so Xi Jun had this wonderful saying. Zhou Shixun had a scar on his forehead and was known as the three-eyed one at school. The Cangsheng called the three-eyed classmate (Cangsheng's uncle). Shixun arrived the earliest that night and was very interested. Those who came all rushed to Zhou to shake hands and shouted, "Uncle, long time no see." Shixun smiled and said, "I am in the store and say the store. You are a little too small to look at Dasheng."</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Kaisheng is also an alumnus of the school and was also one of the earliest initiators of the Alumni Association. He was unable to participate in the work after going abroad. He specially sent a telegram to Shanghai to congratulate the establishment of the association. The end of the telegram also wished (Cangsheng Long Live), which can be said to be very thoughtful. Huang Boqiao, the current Director of the Public Works Bureau, and Qiu Mingjiu, the Magistrate of Baoshan County, were once faculty members of the school. Representatives were also sent to attend the meeting that day.</p>
<p>In addition, there are quite a few former students of the school who are unemployed due to various reasons. They all came to register in person that night to request placement. The association plans to select a number of committee members from the alumni to handle this matter and first investigate the reasons for the unemployment of each classmate, and then find ways to place them to avoid falling into depravity.</p>
<p>During the dinner, Yicheng Company presented beer, and all the alumni drank as much as they could. A certain classmate stood up and said, "We used to be most afraid of eating vegetarian food at school, but today we chose a vegetarian restaurant to hold the establishment meeting, which is a bit out of tune with our appetite. But for the sake of remembering our alma mater, we have to ask for vegetables and tofu."</p>
<p>After the dinner, it was nearly 11 o'clock. The classmates who lived in the city were afraid of the inconvenience of traveling at night, so they proposed to adjourn the meeting. The lively scene came to an end.</p>
<h3>Glass House · Autumn · Water</h3>
<p>Occasionally, when I go to a flower garden, I see a glass room filled with flowers and plants to protect against wind and rain, allow sunlight to pass through, and store heat to cultivate flowers and trees. Its conception is also clever. Recently, when reading Western newspapers, I saw that there are houses made of glass to accommodate patients. The house is located in Los Angeles, USA, and was built by a doctor. The whole house is made of glass, like a large greenhouse. Placing patients inside to enjoy the sunlight and breathe fresh air can speed up the recovery of many diseases, especially for those with lung diseases. The whole house is divided into several rooms, and the walls between the rooms are also made of glass. However, patients often prefer quiet and do not want others to peep, so they often put lead on the walls to isolate them. There is no cleaner and more hygienic sickroom than this.</p>
<h3>Gold Mountain Excursion - Traces on Ice</h3>
<p>I had long desired to visit Gold Mountain, but was repeatedly hindered by worldly affairs. At the end of last month, I fulfilled an appointment with a friend and went to Zhenjiang. Although I was a guest for less than half a day and didn't have time to climb Jiao Mountain, the few hours I spent touring the scenic spots of Gold Mountain were enough to wash away all the dust and refresh my mind. I am recording these snippets of the excursion to make a record, hoping to leave behind some faint traces of my passage.</p>
<p>The pagoda on Gold Mountain is estimated to be seven stories high. At the base of the pagoda, a door opens, and a monk stands guard. Visitors may donate incense money at their discretion. Each level is adorned with Buddha figures and dragons. The walls are not wide, but they are covered with graffiti. Most Chinese people have a fondness for fame, so they often leave inscriptions at will when lingering at beautiful scenes. Moreover, some famous figures leave calling cards as souvenirs. The monks then paste these on the walls as decorations, which is tantamount to opening a small exhibition of names.</p>
<p>The Gold Mountain Temple is grand and the Buddha statues are tall and majestic, but the area near the pagoda is especially pleasant with its fresh air. The winding corridors lead to a pavilion with a stone tablet, where one can overlook the river and sky, and vaguely see the fishing boats on the Yangtze River. In front, a tall pole has been erected for surveying purposes by the provincial government. The area is clean and tidy, suggesting that the monks are diligent in sweeping and cleaning on a regular basis.</p>
<p>According to novelists, Gold Mountain Temple is especially famous because of Fahai. Therefore, those who visit the mountain invariably seek out Fahai Cave. My visit happened to be near the end of the lunar May, so the cave was particularly bustling with activity. The cave is a hole at the bottom of the mountain, and it is quite gloomy inside. In the center, there is a Buddha statue, presumably representing the monk Fahai. Next to the cave, there is a room built against the mountain, where a monk receives visitors. Many visitors throw copper coins into the room, saying that they are forming good karma.</p>
<p>Going through the main hall and up, one can be led by a monk to the Sutra Depository, which houses many jade Buddha statues and some scriptures. The jade Buddha statues are exquisitely carved. It is said that they were brought from Tibet during the Qing dynasty. The embroidered curtains are deeply drawn, and they are not lightly shown to ordinary guests. In front of the shrine, there is a small hole in the glass. One of the Buddha statues inside is also slightly damaged. Upon inquiry, I learned that during the Northern Expedition of the Fengtian Army in the past, a bullet flew from outside the mountain and was impacted and left unrepaired to preserve a momento. The monks lavishly spoke of past events, with eloquent speech, but much of it was unfounded. Hence, we returned a smile in response.</p>
<h3>Recording a Comic Convention: 蓓開 Red Canal</h3>
<p>Records and movies are the most popular forms of entertainment nowadays. 蓓開 Record Company has seized the opportunity to rise to prominence. It is estimated that they have recorded over three hundred kinds of records of famous performers, with a variety of Southern and Northern styles. It can be said to be a compilation of recordings. My friends, Ding Song and Plum Blossom Pavilion Master, invited me a few days ago to listen to the various new comedy records they recently made. All of the famous comedians in Shanghai, such as Wang Wuneng, Liu Chunshan, Lu Xiaowu, Guan Wuling, Gu Leisheng, etc., are included. Gathering comedy experts in one place is like a comedy convention. Here are some notes of all the great records. Wang Wuneng's (Yangzhou Wugeng Tune), (Comic Tune), (Foreign Original Mole), (Changshu Pearl Curtain Village) are all sung with superb skill, both cool and witty. The purity of the flavor is like that of Yu Shuyan in Peking Opera. Lu Xiaowu's (Painting Golden Phoenix Seeking Rain) and (Haircut) make a big deal out of small things, captivating the audience. One can imagine his funny expression in the tone. Liu Chunshan's (Hot Water Bottle) is his best work, like rolling pearls, extremely proficient, innovative, and imaginative. Even the old pedants who use words such as "zhi hu zhe ye" will laugh silently. Ding Guai Guai's (Improved Shila Temple) and (Opium Mao Yanshou) have novel melodies and experienced singing skills, and are also extraordinary. Han Langen's (Countryman Attending Dance Party), (A Sudden Shower), (Brother, I Love You) are derived from the original "Fine Rain" and are presented in a comical way. This is a groundbreaking creation in the recording industry and is worth listening to. Gu Leisheng's (Jiangbei's Good Old Man), (Don't Smoke Opium), (Shandong Zhuge Liang), (Distance Tests the Strength of the Ox) include both folk tunes and Peking Opera, demonstrating his many talents and artistic abilities. Guan Wuling and Cheng Xiaoting's duet (Old Gun Leaving Kiln) and (Improved Capturing Neng Sanlang) both have amusing lyrics and peculiar tunes that are enough to make people listen to them repeatedly. Guan and Cheng are rising stars in the comedy world. 蓓開 has a keen eye and is storing them up for the future of recording. Once they are released, they will surely become popular without any promotion. Furthermore, Lu Xixi and Lu Qiqi's duet (Improved Dingjun Mountain), (Suzhou Fan Zhonghua), (Shanghai Scenery), (Comedy Confidante) is another style. The two have equal skill in tone and their duet shows are particularly wonderful.</p>
<h3>Recording Dongshi Human Head, Skinny, Sheep</h3>
<p>In Yang's eastern suburbs, there is a place called Dongshi Human Head, which is a relic from the time of the Hong-Yang Rebellion. The area is vast and covered with lush vegetation. According to local elders, during the Hong-Yang Rebellion, a certain unit of Hong Xiuquan's army was stationed here. To the east of their garrison, they erected a wooden pole with a stone human head hanging on it for military suppression. Later, when the army was ordered to urgently transfer to another location, they abandoned the stone head and did not take it with them. After the rebellion was suppressed, the stone head remained. Local people, fearing misfortune, did not dare to destroy it. They gathered and decided to move it to the fields. Over time, it sank into the mud. Later generations named the area Dongshi Human Head, and the name has been passed down to this day. The original name of the village has faded into obscurity. However, the gazetteer does not contain any record of this, and the scholars speak of it with certainty. We cannot say that it is unfounded. I will record it here for further verification.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (210) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Emerald Locks and Pearly Hairpins, a Beautiful Woman Returns, a Fine Gentleman's Green Chamber and Red Curtain, a Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family. It was at that moment that Ruiyun returned. The eldest aunt stopped mentioning her marriage when she saw Ruiyun return, and said, "Second Master has been here for a long time. He was about to leave, but I kept him for you." As she spoke, it seemed that her role as Ruiyun's escort had been handed over to her. Ruiyun nodded slightly to Zuo Shichen and said, "You haven't been here for several days. How is the newspaper so busy?" By then, the eldest aunt had already walked out of the outer room. Zuo Shichen said, "I'm afraid I'll be coming here less often in the future." Ruiyun smiled again and said, "Why? Can't you still come? You and the eldest aunt are old friends. Didn't you know her before you knew me?" Zuo Shichen said, "No, I knew you first. I knew you in Nanjing, at your house." When Ruiyun heard this, she couldn't help but lower her head, playing with a corner of the embroidered silk handkerchief in her hand, biting it between her pearly teeth. She said, "Do I still have a home? I am a lonely person. My father, my mother, I don't know where they are now, whether they are in this world or not." Zuo Shichen thought, "This is not good," because these words had stirred up her thoughts. Indeed, since she was sold, she had not heard any news from home for six or seven years. Even her parents did not know about her fall into prostitution. Zuo Shichen had once heard Ruiyun ask him, "Second Master, have you been to Nanjing in recent years? I don't know where my mother moved to. If you go to Nanjing in the future, please inquire for me." Zuo Shichen had long known from Zhang Huantong that they no longer lived in their original place, and even Zhang Huantong's house had been sold and rebuilt. But Nanjing was so big, where could he inquire? Moreover, Zuo Shichen had not had any business in Nanjing this year. Furthermore, these words could only be said in private. If the eldest aunt knew, she would say that parents should not look for their daughters if they sell them off. The social custom dictates that they already severed their ties, but due to their natural bond with their own parents, Ruiyun, although a little girl who did not know much about sorrow, occasionally thought of her parents, tearfully hating them for selling her into such misery. But then she thought that they could not live without her. At this moment, she was getting married, and she did not know where her parents were. This was something that every girl would be concerned about. Zuo Shichen quickly changed the subject and said, "It's late today. Will you go out for a nice meal tomorrow?" Ruiyun shook her head and said, "I won't go." Zuo Shichen said, "Why not? Are you afraid that Mama will say that you're wasting time?" Ruiyun said, "These days, even if I don't go out to sing, she won't necessarily scold me." Zuo Shichen said, "Then why don't you come?" Ruiyun said, "I'm not happy."</p>

<h3>Tightening of Financial Credit Intensifies</h3>
<p>Reaching Six Percent</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the bank holiday for Christmas, money shops found their credit situation becoming increasingly strained, leading to a surge in interbank lending rates. Both morning and afternoon markets reached six percent, a sharp increase of two percent compared to the previous day's afternoon market, and only one percent away from the seven percent peak. The market's anxiety is beyond description. However, insiders hope that the banks will open today, Tuesday, and provide some liquidity, potentially easing the situation. Due to the sharp rise in interbank lending rates, those holding foreign currency mostly sought to sell it in exchange for silver to meet their short-term needs, leading to a large number of sellers and a further drop in market prices. The morning market was at 7.15875%, and the afternoon market was at 7.1525%, a further drop of 0.1% compared to the previous day's morning market. Transactions for foreign currency were 650,000 for morning draft and 730,000 for the afternoon. Banknote transactions were 5,000 for morning and 30,000 for afternoon. Over-the-counter banknote transactions were 85,000 for morning and 45,000 for afternoon. Foreign currency buying and selling and silver exchange by banks were not recorded due to the holiday closure. Foreign currency public orders for money shops were over 4.2 million, and silver public orders were settled for over 32 million. Small money shops bought and sold banknotes for about 400,000 to 500,000 and sold drafts. The source of customer traffic was approximately 400,000 in silver currency and over 600,000 in remittances from various regions. The situation for subsidiary coins was: morning market for Jiangsu small silver coins was at 6.28%, and the afternoon market was at 6.29%, with transactions of 1,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were at 5.975% in the morning market and 5.95% in the afternoon market, with transactions of 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to 408,500 per 1,000 strings of cash.</p>

<h3>Disbandment Bonds Continue to Rise by Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's bond market in the local area saw more activity in spot Disbandment Bonds, while other bonds remained quiet. Futures trading was active as before, with an estimated 5.67 million yuan traded in the morning market and several hundred thousand yuan in the afternoon. The fluctuations of each bond were also very strong. Except for the steady prices of the 7-year, 96, and Financial Bonds, the 25th series also saw slight fluctuations. Other bonds initially rose sharply in the morning market due to strong buying interest, and although prices fluctuated throughout the day, the overall trend was upward. Demobilization Bonds saw the strongest gains, with near-month futures rising to the limit. As a result, June futures rose by 3 yuan, July futures reached 3.8 jiao. Customs and Disbandment Bonds also rose by about 2 yuan. The Sixth series rose by 1.7 jiao, while others rose by several jiao to 1 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Trends Downward</h3>
<p>With sluggish actual sales and continued declines in yarn futures, the yarn market is showing a weak downward trend. This is because rising silver prices have led to increased short selling and a looser market. As sales remain sluggish, confidence is weak, and the market is trending downward. However, inventories are indeed lower than last month, suggesting that prices should not be excessively bearish. Moreover, many bullish traders remain committed. Overall, the key to yarn market price fluctuations lies in whether actual demand is robust.</p>
<p>人標 (Renbiao) has been heavily selling off yarn futures. The market was initially stable at the opening, but deteriorated due to unfavorable news and sluggish spot sales. The market became looser, and prices for all months fell by 8 qian, 1 liang, and 1.1 qian. In the afternoon, news of sluggish sales and heavy selling by Renbiao led to further declines of 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 19,450 bales. The closing prices for Renbiao are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Month  | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|--------|---------------|--------|---------------|</p>
<p>| Sept.  | 1595          | -14    | 18,950        |</p>
<p>| June   | 1559          | -22    | 200          |</p>
<p>| Oct.   | 1599          | -11    | 18,550        |</p>
<p>| July   | 1569          |       | 32700        |</p>
<p>| Nov.   | 1604          |       | 28,800        |</p>
<p>| Aug.   | 1585          |       | 425,750       |</p>
<p>Yarn sales have slowed. Spot sales are average, with a total of 885 bales purchased by various merchant groups. 60 bales were entered by domestic traders. Among the customer groups, 牛莊 (Niuzhuang) bought the most, with 165 bales. In addition, 蕪湖 (Wuhu) entered 170 bales, 寧波 (Ningbo) entered 40 bales, 天津 (Tianjin) entered 70 bales, domestic trade accounted for 65 bales, 江西 (Jiangxi) entered 90 bales, 徐州 (Xuzhou) entered 30 bales, 漢口 (Hankou) entered 40 bales, 廣東 (Guangdong) entered 35 bales, 安東 (Andong) entered 30 bales, and miscellaneous traders entered 50 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign cotton prices fell, and silver prices trended upward, weakening local sentiment. The 漢帶 (Hantai) traders have switched from being largely bullish to bearish, as retail investors liquidate their long positions. The market has suddenly become looser, with a worsening trend. Furthermore, a decline in gold prices is expected today, leading to increased selling. In addition, tight credit conditions have exacerbated the situation. However, inventories remain thin, and 漢幫 (Hanbang) traders are taking profits. The future of the cotton market is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The 漢標 (Hanbiao) price plummeted by 7 qian. At the exchange, the 漢標 market opened weaker due to weak foreign cotton prices and looser market conditions. Prices for all months fell by 4 to 5.5 qian. The afternoon opening was average, but the second and third sessions were particularly weak. A major change in exchange rates is expected today, and sellers are taking the opportunity to pressure the market. Near-term prices fell by 5 fen, and far-term prices fell by 2.5 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 54,000 dan. The closing prices for 漢標 are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Month  | Closing Price | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|--------|---------------|--------|---------------|</p>
<p>| Aug.   | 37.55         | -6.0   | 65,500        |</p>
<p>| June   | 36.50         | -4.5   | 58,600        |</p>
<p>| Oct.   | 36.85         |        | 562,900       |</p>
<p>| July   | 37.00         |        | 571,500       |</p>
<p>| Nov.   | 36.6/70        |        | 44,000        |</p>
<p>Actual demand has suddenly become sluggish. Spot cotton trading has become lighter. The sources were estimated to be just over 1,000 bales of 通花 (Tonghua) and 750 bales of 姚花 (Yaohua). 400 bales of 姚花 were sold at prices ranging from 34.22 to 34.24 taels, delivered by 廣幫 (Guangbang) from spot warehouses.</p>

<h3>English Indian Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Bombay: Last week, Japanese traders had no transactions. It is feared that there will be no significant prospects in the near future. China also had no interest due to low silver prices and unfavorable exchange rates. It is reported that 20,000 bales have been sold back to India. Due to larger price differences, Indian cotton is more easily absorbed than American cotton. European exporters already have considerable demand. The local market has seen a small price drop due to political instability. The statistics for last week are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool: Spot demand was quiet last week. Futures were bearish due to good weather in the American cotton growing regions, but buyers have already shown interest in entering the market. It is reported that the US Federal Farm Bureau will lend 75% of the market price for wheat and cotton this season. The Egyptian cotton market situation is dull.</p>
<h3>Statistics of Domestic Textile Mills in the 18th Year [of the Republic]</h3>
<p>Chinese Mills Enjoy Special Benefits, Increasing by Five Mills; Japanese Mills Maintain Superior Skills, Decreasing by Only One Mill; British Mills Have Plans to Increase Spindles, But No Increase or Decrease Seen; Total Increase of 250,472 Spindles and 1,639 Looms. Since the 10th Year of the Republic [1921], China's cotton textile industry has shown a declining trend due to various factors. Since the Jinan Incident and the boycott of Japanese goods, coupled with a surge in demand across a unified nation, the situation has drastically changed, transforming from decline to a golden age. Chinese mills, due to the boycott, enjoyed special benefits, while Japanese mills, with their superior skills, also performed well. Consequently, the performance of various mills last year was unprecedented in the past seven or eight years. Therefore, there have been quite a few cases of increasing spindles and looms, and preparing for new mills. According to the report statistics of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, in the 18th year, there were 124 domestic textile mills (note: referring to those already in operation), an increase of four mills compared to the 17th year, with 3,899,542 spindles, an increase of 250,472 spindles, and 29,322 looms, an increase of 1,639 looms. The general situation of Chinese, British, and Japanese yarn mills in various regions in the 18th year is recorded below:</p>

In Shanghai, there were three increases: one was Longmao Textile Company, which purchased old machinery from the Japanese-owned Donghua First Mill with 10,080 spindles for 220,000 taels. Donghua's sale was not due to business failure, but for reorganization and improvement, selling imperfect old machinery and purchasing new machinery instead. This is a proactive rather than a passive move by the Japanese. Another was Baoxing Yarn Mill on Hutai Road in Zhabei, which purchased 12,240 old British spinning machines. Another was Xie Feng Yarn Mill on Binlang Road in West Shanghai, originally a thread mill, which added 5,200 spinning machines last year and was renamed a yarn mill. The remaining one was Changzhou Fuda Yarn Mill, i.e., the owner of Guangxin Mill, who, after selling Guangxin, purchased old machinery from domestic and foreign mills with 3,200 spindles to establish a new mill. One was Shanxi Jinhua Second Mill, with an estimated 20,000 new spindles, and one was Xinjiang Dihua Fumin Textile Company, with an estimated 1,500 spindles. As for foreign-owned mills, Donghua First Mill in Shanghai, which was owned by a Japanese company, was sold to a Chinese company. Its original name, "Third," is no longer used, and it is now referred to as one mill. The rest have significantly increased spindles and looms. As for those in other ports, Jinzhou added a second mill internally and externally. Superficially, the number of mills decreased by one, but in reality, only 10,000 old spindles were reduced. British mills have not changed. There are rumors of plans to add 2,000 yarn spindles and 300 looms. In addition to the above, there have been slight changes in Chinese mills, namely Guangxin being merged into Sulun, Changzhou Dalun changing ownership and being renamed Dacheng Textile Company, and Taicang Yarn Mill, originally leased by Litai Company, now being purchased by the company and renamed Litai Yarn Mill. Yeqin Yarn Mill in Wuxi, which has been closed for several years, has been leased by Fuxing Company. Guangyi in Zhangde, Henan, has been renamed Yuxin Spinning Company and leased out. Jingwei (waste flower mill) in Shanghai has also been leased by Heji Company. As for the loom item listed in the table, a decrease is seen because some of the looms planned to be added in the 17th year have not been installed, and some of the installed looms have been sold or discontinued, such as Jiuxing, which has already sold 200 installed looms to China Underwear Company, and Puyi Mill, which has been installed for a long time but has not yet started operation. However, foreign mills have generally increased, and some have begun using automatic looms. Foreign mills have also mostly increased the number of thread spindles. However, the position of the cotton textile industry in the 18th year can be considered excellent, and there are more investors. The following mills are organized and expected to start operating within this year: Mill Name Location Yarn Spindles Looms Mill Name Location Yarn Spindles Looms</p>

<p>The opening of the above nine Chinese mills, such as Shenxin No. 8, Puyi, Yongyu, Liao Ying, Shashi, etc., is not far off. The others are not yet certain. The five Japanese mills are all actively carrying out the transfer period, which is currently underway. However, the number of yarn spindles in our country will soon exceed four million.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Downriver Rice Market Weak and Exhausted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than ten ships arrived in Zhabei from various routes, but sales were still sluggish. The North Jiangsu high-quality glutinous rice still maintained its original price, because the top-quality goods were scarce. The stock of medium-quality goods was quite large, and the sales continued to be stagnant, so the market price was slightly reduced. The left-side second-quality glutinous rice had no customers, and the asking price also varied greatly. The thin rice market was tired, and the price was slightly fixed due to the scarcity of goods. The special top-quality goods were still priced at 20 yuan and six or seven cents. The Yangdu pointed rice was silent and soundless. The standard market price was around 19 yuan. The white rice was continuously declining, and the sales were sluggish. The ships arrived one after another, so the situation was extremely tired. The source of downriver rice in South Shanghai was not strong, and the sales were weak. The buyers' appetites for Changzhou-Wuxi North Jiangsu glutinous rice were still acceptable, but they were very picky, and the market price was stable. The Suzhou-Tongzhou white rice was weak by one cent. The rural villages were not prosperous. According to every step, the farmers' appetites for medium and low-quality rice were quite acquisitive and stockpiling, which is commonly known as "silkworm opening the door." However, this year it did not develop, and the transaction was deserted. This was due to the poor silkworm harvest and the high price of rice. The sales of South Jiangsu rice were weak, and the Ningbo rice market was still observing the situation. The pointed rice was the same as that in Zhabei. The Tongbian rice was sluggish and quiet, and the situation was still tired. It was difficult to revitalize the situation in the short term, and the price was gradually softening. The Yin Yuan sales slightly improved, and the eating plate was extremely tight, and a reduction in price was invisibly seen. The top-quality goods were priced at around 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Soared by Two or Three Cents in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening market for imported rice was very weak in the morning. Each type of rice continued to fall slightly, mainly because the market was driven by the continuous influx of rice in recent days. In the afternoon, the market suddenly turned around with brisk sales from inland areas such as Hankou and Jiangxi, as well as military demand. The price suddenly rose by two or three cents. Except for No. 1 Saigon rice, which only rose by one cent, all other types of rice rose by about two cents. The total market sold nearly 10,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice at a price of 15 yuan to 14 yuan and eight or nine cents. Also, 600 bags of brown rice were priced at 14 yuan and five and a half cents. 700 bags of Xuye brown rice, etc., were priced at 13 yuan and nine and a half cents. 2,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice were priced at 14 yuan and nine cents. Also, 3,000 bags of No. 1 rice were priced at 15 yuan and six cents, it was said.</p>
<h3>Recent Flour Price Surged by More Than Four Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was still calm in the early months. The price of this month's flour was unusually strong due to the small amount of goods entering the market. The others were generally hovering. By the time the market opened in the afternoon of June and July, the market was again in a state of frenzy. The reason for this repeated frenzy seems to have focused on reality. Because the factory's inventory is very thin, the current flour is already in short supply. Although the new wheat has already been harvested, first, the value is surprisingly high, and it is gradually approaching the price reduction of old wheat; second, transportation is inconvenient, and it cannot be used immediately. Therefore, the internal and external markets seem to have reached a consensus. If the environment is so bad, the market has to rise, which is unavoidable. Looking at this, the lowest limit for this month must reach 2 taels and 6 qian per 100 jin. If wheat can be poured into the market in July, there may be a chance to relax at that time. As a result, this month's price soared by four and a half cents compared to the previous weekend, July's price rose by three cents and seven and a half li, August's price rose by two cents and nine li, September's price rose by one and a half cents, October's price rose by five li, and November's price rose by two and a half cents, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Soaring Price of Futures Wheat</h3>
<p>The price in the production area is gradually rising, and the combined cost of transportation to Shanghai is not smooth. The recent price has soared by seven cents, and various factories are rushing to purchase spot goods. Yesterday, the price of futures wheat also rose across the board. Although it is currently the peak season for harvesting and the weather is good, the market should theoretically be able to stabilize. However, the price of new wheat in various production areas is good, and due to the relationship between rice prices, it has gradually become more expensive. For example, the initial price in Suzhou was 9 yuan, but yesterday's price was said to be no less than 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Adding water foot and transportation costs to Shanghai would require 5 taels and 4 qian and 1 fen. The price in Wuxi was 8 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, which would also require 4 taels and 9 qian to Shanghai. According to the above market conditions, all are more expensive than the Shanghai standard. Therefore, the standard market price has risen across the board. As a result, this month's price rose by seven cents compared to the previous weekend, July to September each rose by three cents, and October and November each rose by two cents. Various factories are in high demand for spot wheat, and they are rushing to purchase it, which has caused the price of new and old wheat to rise by another three cents. The price of new wheat in Huzhou is 4 taels and 7 qian and a half, Nanjing wheat is 4 taels and 8 qian and 2 fen, Pudong wheat is 4 taels and 5 qian and a half, 5 qian, 4 qian and a half, 4 qian. Wusong wheat is 4 taels and 6 qian and a half, 6 qian, 5 qian, 7 fen, 5 qian. Shuangfeng wheat is 4 taels and 8 qian, 7 qian and a half, 7 qian. Kunshan wheat is 4 taels and 8 qian and a half, 8 qian, 7 qian, 8 fen, 7 qian and a half. Penglai Zhen wheat is 4 taels and 7 taels and 3 fen, 7 qian, 6 qian, 7 fen, 6 qian and a half, 6 qian. Anting wheat is 4 taels and 5 qian and a half, 5 qian. Chongming wheat is 4 taels and 6 qian and 2 fen, 4 qian, 7 fen, totaling 8,000 bags. Chen Che wheat is 5 taels and 1 qian and 8 fen, totaling 1,000 bags, it was said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Markets in a State of Collapse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British merchants all believed that the current financial turmoil and the lack of overseas telegrams showing a change in Shanghai's attitude made the market more inclined to wait and see. The market was in a state of collapse. The entire market only sold 430 boxes of Qimen black tea and 77 boxes of shrimp eyes, and the selling price fell by another two or three taels compared to last week, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sales of Dress Materials, Barrages, and Jewel Gauze are Good</h3>
<p>Barrages have been selling quite well recently. The Western clothing industry has a great need for them. Most of these barrages are crepe patterns, with monochrome, mixed colors, silk grabs, and stripes. The price of pure wool goods is more than four taels per yard, and the price of second-class goods is two taels, while the most popular ones are those with a general price of three taels and three or five qian. This is also a new color in the recent popular pullover material and woolen cloth. Jewel gauze is specially made for mosquito nets and is only in demand in the summer. Customers all have to purchase from woolen cloth and foreign goods shops and Western furniture stores. Yesterday, the guild continued to open Thaihe goods, which sold for five qian per yard. Yongfeng and New Sassoon were five qian and two and a half fen. Ruikang's old brand goods had to be five qian and a half. Chinese and French double-layered jewel gauze was eight qian, it was said.</p>
<h3>Hardware: British Steel Plates are Selling Well</h3>
<p>After the British steel plates were raised in price, all industries waited and watched, so there had been no transactions in the market for a long time. The day before yesterday, various industries in Qingdao and Tianjin received letters from their local headquarters to add to their purchases, so the market sentiment suddenly improved, and the market was very stable. It was found that as many as six or seven hundred pieces were opened, and the market price was estimated at 10 taels and 5 qian and a half fen at 2%. 7 taels and 2 qian and a half at 7%, 7 taels and 5 qian and 1 fen at 7%, 7 taels and 1 qian and a half fen, and half above were all estimated at 6 taels and 7 qian and a half. Other industries in Niuzhuang and Yingkou also sent many letters asking about the price, so the situation became more lively. It was heard that very little goods had arrived in the later batches, so those who held inventory were unusually confident, it was said.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: General Situation of Hankou's Export Products</h3>
<p>Hankou's export products are mainly cotton, tung oil, livestock products (both primary and secondary), and tea. The total annual export volume of cotton is at least 1.5 to 1.6 million dan. However, cotton merchants and peddlers only care about current interests and have a long-standing habit of adulterating and falsifying the cotton over the years, resulting in excessively damp cotton that is prone to mold and rot. When shipped abroad, it is often returned. Fortunately, the government has established a bureau in Hankou to implement inspections, and the accumulated malpractices of previous years are gradually being eliminated. The annual export of tung oil is about 300,000 dan, and the sales are mostly to the United States. In the past ten years, the United States has needed tung oil as a raw material for manufacturing various paints, and the quantity needed has increased year by year. Therefore, tung trees have been experimentally planted in Florida and other southern provinces, and the results are quite good. Moreover, the oil quality is pure and far superior to that produced in our country, and the Ministry of Agriculture is encouraging farmers to plant tung trees with all its might. If the people of our country do not reflect on themselves and urgently seek remedies, it is feared that the export of domestic raw materials will be hit again in a few years. As for tea, since competing with Ceylon, Java, and Japanese tea, international trade has long been in decline. More recently, the Sino-Russian relations have broken down several times, and the producing areas have been rampant with communists and have not been completely suppressed, resulting in a decrease in the total annual export volume. It has been found that the export volume in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic was more than 50,000 dan, worth 1.4 million taels of customs silver, and the tea bricks were more than 200,000 dan, worth 5 or 6 million taels of customs silver. The export of tea was mostly sold to Russia. Before the Sino-Russian negotiations are completely resolved, the export of tea bricks will be greatly reduced. In addition, livestock by-products such as cowhide, animal intestines, egg white, and pig bristles, etc., which are shipped from Hankou to domestic areas, are worth 1.1 million taels per year. However, this type of business is mostly controlled by foreigners, and Chinese merchants only do what they can to collect, purchase, and supply.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: 9,263 Boxes of New Tea Shipped from the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>1,164 pieces of cocoons shipped from Wuhu, 1,486 barrels of tung oil, 1,053 pieces of Jiangxi paper transferred from Hongjiang to Shanghai. Yesterday, 600 pieces of green beans were imported and shipped to Mumbai in more than 30 trucks, 700 pieces of foreign paper, 225 pieces of American-made cotton yarn machines arrived in Shanghai. 1,500 bags of white rice and 1,200 bags of salt shipped from Hankou to Hankou. 300 boxes of British woolen fabrics arrived in Shanghai. 200 pieces have arrived at Jinshanwei, and the board has not yet opened for sale. The port electricity pepper production market has risen again by 3 shields and 75 cents. The price of Dongyang dried mussels has risen sharply due to the soaring exchange rate, rising to 82 and a half taels.</p>

<h3>Two Directors of the Ministry of Finance Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Negotiating Relief Fund Increase</h3>
<p>The gold market has suddenly risen in recent days, and domestic industry and commerce have been greatly affected. Moreover, the price of silver has plummeted, affecting people's livelihood. Therefore, officials from industry, commerce, finance, and banking circles are all discussing relief measures. Although the two ministers, Kong and Soong, made two proposals during a meeting a few days ago, they are still subject to approval by the National Government due to the importance of the matter. Minister of Finance Soong Ziwen saw that the gold market was rising without end, so he telegraphed to Nanjing to order Xu Kan, Director of the Silver Coin Department, and Zheng Lai, Director of the Public Debt Department, to come to Shanghai. Minister Soong went to Songjiang yesterday to inspect the anti-smuggling team. After returning to Shanghai, he returned to Nanjing that evening due to the busy public affairs of the ministry. He ordered the two directors to negotiate on his behalf on all matters in Shanghai within the day. He also took the two methods proposed earlier with Minister Kong, namely, stopping the bidding of gold and maintaining the price of silver, to Nanjing to discuss with economic experts in Nanjing, it was said.</p>
<h3>Committee to Abolish the Likin Tax</h3>
<p>A Preparatory Meeting Was Held Yesterday. The Preparatory Committee to Abolish the Likin Tax held its third preparatory meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday on the third floor of the Central Bank. More than 20 people attended. Li Jihong presided over the meeting until 6:10 p.m. It was heard that the content was still the procedures for the preparation of the general meeting and the sorting of proposals, it was said.</p>
<h3>Pessimism in the Market Amidst Rising Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants are Already Panicked. Due to the impact of the soaring gold market and the plummeting silver prices, most foreign import companies have suffered huge losses. As for the Japanese companies in this port that cannot support themselves, many are also showing signs of uneasiness due to market conditions. For example, Mitsui &amp; Co. has announced a salary reduction for all employees due to poor business performance. The amount of the reduction is proportional to the amount of the employee's usual salary. In addition, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, which is known as the king of the shipping industry, has also decided to reorganize internally and reduce redundant staff due to a 3/8 reduction in business. Other large and small companies have not been able to profit due to mutual involvement and influence. Therefore, they have unanimously decided to suspend the payment of employee bonuses for the first half of this year. Other small-scale companies have closed down one after another, and it is difficult to count the number of closings. The Goods in the Warehouses The sales of imported and exported goods have stagnated in recent days, and most of them are piled up in various warehouses. As a result, the goods in the warehouses are piled up like mountains, and the business of the warehouses has become very developed. Since the suspension of Chinese ships, the foreign ships are crowded with goods and cannot be loaded. Most of the goods are also piled up in various warehouses. The Yangtze River industries are also difficult to sell due to the current situation. According to a survey yesterday, in addition to hardware, fabrics, and groceries, the amount of imported rice piled up in various warehouses in this port has reached more than 500,000 bags, it was said. The Crisis in the Mercerizing Industry The decline in the industrial sector has been a general phenomenon in recent years. However, the adverse impact on the mercerizing industry has been greater than that of other industries because most of the raw materials used, such as cotton yarn, yellow caustic soda, and caustic soda, are foreign goods and gold is expensive and silver is cheap. Recently, there have been increasing reports of companies that have been unable to maintain operations and have closed down. The Mercerized Cotton Weaving Association of the industry has already discussed relief measures on the 9th of this month and plans not to increase wages temporarily this year. It is heard that the industry's labor union has always embraced the spirit of labor-management cooperation and is quite understanding of the difficulties of the capitalists, it was said.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Navy Minister Yang Shuzhuang went to Mogan Mountain to recuperate from illness. Recently, he had some contact with the Min affairs and returned to Shanghai by car from Hangzhou at 2:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<h3>Record of Current People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and Finance Minister Song Ziwen both went to Nanjing by overnight train last night.</p>
<h3>Telegram Received by the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government received a telegram from the General Commander's Headquarters Staff Department in Yejigang yesterday, saying that there was a victory report: (1) According to the telegram from Commander Gu Yangwu, the enemy launched an all-out general offensive against our army at noon. The enemy facing the third regiment of our army's first brigade, Wugang position, was the third division of the Jin rebels. At 1:00 p.m., they launched a fierce attack on our Wugang position with two elite regiments, and another regiment launched a fierce attack on the Shedeng position. At the same time, Yang Yaofang's department facing our army's second division launched a fierce attack on our Damaoguzhai with two regiments, and Sun Chu's department facing Commander Chen launched a fierce attack on our Wuzhai with about two regiments. However, all of them were bravely repelled by our army. According to the prisoners, the Jin army has suffered too many casualties and has now reluctantly reorganized, only establishing a division, etc. In summary, the enemy's casualties in this battle were more than 3,000 officers and soldiers. More than ten people below the rank of commander of the rebellious regiment and battalion commander were captured. Five mountain cannons, twenty-five heavy and light machine guns, submachine guns, and more than nine hundred rifles and cavalry trees, and countless ammunition were seized, it was said. (2) According to the telegram from Jiang Bocheng Yuwu, about 2,000 brave enemy troops from Luokou secretly crossed the iron bridge that night. They were fiercely swept by our field artillery and machine guns on the way and were all killed under the bridge, it was said. (3) According to the captured officers, the Jin army is currently using rifle bullets. Because they cannot be manufactured in the rear in time, only dozens of rounds are used each time. The rifles used are not refined steel. After more than ten rounds, the heat increases sharply and causes obstacles. Moreover, the aiming machine is not accurate, so it is difficult to hit the target. Machine guns and submachine guns also lose their effectiveness after five rows of bullets due to the aforementioned reasons. Jiuzi claimed that Feng's rebellious army lost almost all of its elite troops in the north because half of the equipment and ammunition supplied by the Jin army were not applicable. There was a lot of blame on Yan, and Feng's subordinates were even more resentful of Yan, it was said. This is a special victory report.</p>
<h3>New Fast Ships Added Between China and the United States</h3>
<p>Preparing to Open Classes One After Another Kawasaki Adds New Line Kawasaki Company, a Japanese company, was the first to implement a sharp drop in the water freight of Huzhou silk in the China-US line this year. Subsequently, British and American shipping companies were afraid of being affected by it, so they repeatedly negotiated with them to join the Pacific Water Freight Alliance. Until May, Kawasaki agreed to join. The company originally only had eight 10,000-ton ships operating on the San Francisco route to Shanghai. Now, due to excess tonnage, it has specially decided to add a new route within the Shanghai-Seattle line and has already assigned four 8,000-ton cargo ships to come to Shanghai to start operations before July 15. Mitsui Increases Giant Ships The Mitsui Shipping Department's Pacific Line has four 8,000-ton ships that travel between Shanghai, Dalian, Seattle, and Vancouver, specializing in the transportation of cargo and not passengers. Now, because various companies in the Pacific are building new ships, the company has also ordered two 10,000-ton motor-powered giant ships to be built in the country and added to the China-US line to compete. The first ship has already been launched and will come to Shanghai to operate as soon as the cabin space is installed. Japanese Empress to Open The Japanese Empress, built in England by Changxing Company, has been completely completed. The ship has a displacement of 37,000 tons and a speed of 22 nautical miles per hour. It only takes 12 days from Shanghai to Canada, which is the largest ship in the Far East, and its speed has broken the record in the Chinese shipping industry.

In addition, the Rio de Janeiro Maru on the South American route, which goes around the Cape of Good Hope to Argentina in South America, will be opened on the 13th of this month.</p>
<h3>Important Shipping News</h3>
<p>Training Shipping Talents The China Merchant Ship Drivers Association has sent a letter to various shipping companies urging them to increase the number of third officers and nautical apprentices as soon as possible for future training in shipping talents. The Shanghai China Merchants Bureau has appropriately allocated the graduates of the shipping specialty it runs to various ships such as Jiang'an, Xinchang, Xinming, and Gongping for internships. Now, due to the reorganization of the shipping school, the professors have been expanded and special arrangements have been made for the shipping talents needed by Chinese shipping companies across the country to be consulted. Seven measures have been formulated to set qualifications to achieve this goal. At the same time, the shipping school has added courses. In addition to the original two major departments of driving and navigation, a business department has been added to train the latest types of ship buyers and personnel to manage cargo and passengers. Foreign Banks Transship to Hong Kong After the ban on silver was issued, foreign banks still shipped silver to Shanghai. In the previous two shipments, 2.4 million taels of silver bars came to Shanghai from the United States and were strictly prohibited from landing by the Jianghai Customs when they were loaded onto Japanese ships. Therefore, they were changed to be unloaded in Hong Kong. Yesterday, a certain American ship came to Shanghai from New York and San Francisco. The large bars carried in the ship had already been listed in the Hong Kong manifest. Therefore, there was no import of silver when the goods were unloaded in this port. Shanxi Changes Class The Taikoo's foreign ship Shanxi is older and not suitable for coastal operations. From today onwards, the company will transfer it to the Yangtze River and plans to keep it sailing for another six months before it must be abandoned and transformed into a lighter to be used as a cargo</p>
<h3>International Conventions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Discusses Matters in Beijing;  The Shipping Association Sends Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association received a directive from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday stating that the Ministry was instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward a communication from the British Ambassador to China, which stated that he was instructed by the Foreign Secretary of his country to forward the text of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, signed by representatives of several countries on May 31, 1929, for review to ascertain whether your government wishes to accede to all or part of it, and requested a reply after consideration.  Upon investigation, the nature of the convention relates to maritime administration, and it is necessary to determine whether our country should accede to all or part of it. In addition to a separate communication to the Ministry of the Navy, a copy of the communication and the original documents are sent for review and reply. It is noted that the parts of this case related to maritime administration are quite important.  Arrangements are being made with the Ministry of the Navy to hold a meeting at the Ministry of the Navy at 3:00 PM on Friday, June 13th. The association should immediately appoint specialists to attend the meeting for discussion and provide a reply beforehand.  This directive is hereby issued.

<h3>Situation of Chinese Ships Being Blocked by Japan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Consults with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation yesterday sent a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating, "Regarding the matter of Chinese ships being blocked by the Japanese Maritime Bureau from loading goods to Japan in Dalian, as reported by the Shanghai Shipping Association, we previously copied the original report and consulted with you, requesting prompt negotiations. Now, according to a report from the Dalian Zhengji Company, the Chinese ships of the Yingkou Overseas Trading Company are originally Chinese merchant ships engaged in ocean-going passenger and cargo transport and are represented by the company.  On the 8th of this month, they arrived in Dalian from Yingkou with the original intention of loading coal and local products to Yokohama and Shimizu. Unexpectedly, the Dalian Maritime Bureau suddenly prohibited the ships from loading. The company immediately sent a letter to the bureau to negotiate, stating the reasons as follows: (1) According to the Lushun-Dalian Lease Treaty and the establishment of the Dalian Customs by China and Japan, China has sovereignty over this area and stipulates that Chinese and Japanese merchant ships enjoy the same preferential treatment. The bureau's treatment of the area as inland is completely without any treaty basis and should not discriminate against Chinese merchant ships, hindering Sino-Japanese relations. (2) According to the Sino-Japanese Trade and Navigation Treaty, Japanese merchant ships have the right to navigate along the Chinese coast, and the Japanese plenipotentiary minister Hayashi Gonsuke stated in a note that unless it harms the interests or peace of the country, the government will strive for fairness and show friendship, which proves that the Japanese mainland also allows Chinese merchant ships to conduct legitimate business. (3) According to past practice and recent facts, loading should not be prohibited. For example, (A) Since 1924, Zhengji Company's ships have been dispatched to load goods from Dalian to various ports in Japan, as evidenced by export customs documents. In the past one or two years, ships have not been dispatched because of the abundance of goods along the Chinese coast. This was a voluntary decision and not due to any restrictions. (B) On November 16 of last year, the British merchant ship Brlglfdotin loaded six Ford Motor Company cars from Yokohama to Dalian. The local customs cited a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recognizing that it did not infringe on coastal navigation rights and issued a permit. (C) This time, the ship was scheduled to load in Dalian. The agents in Yokohama and Shimizu were consulted in advance regarding whether the customs there could permit loading, and they replied by telegram that loading and unloading were not obstructed. Based on the above treaties and precedents, the company repeatedly contacted the Maritime Bureau in order to fulfill its responsibilities as an agent, but was consistently rejected. The ship was forced to depart without loading on the 10th. However, the shipowner and cargo owner suffered unexpected losses due to the bureau's abuse of power and discrimination against Chinese merchants. This matter concerns our country's sovereignty and international sovereignty. All circumstances are reported truthfully."  It is appropriate to report again in accordance with the facts and respectfully request your review and prompt, serious negotiations on the matter. I hope to receive a response and maintain public friendship.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of the Zhan Rongbing Pension Case</h3>
<p>No Records Found by Various Parties; Further Investigation Will Be Conducted</p>
<p>The Relatives Association of Martyrs Who Died in the May 30th Incident sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to investigate whether the case of Zhan Rongbing, a cotton mill worker who was shot and killed by a Japanese guard at the Xiaoshadu years ago, was resolved with compensation from the Japanese side, requesting a detailed investigation and reply. The office replied to the Relatives Association yesterday, stating that, in response to your association's letter requesting an investigation into whether the case of Zhan Rongbing, a cotton mill worker shot and killed by a Japanese guard at Xiaoshadu, was resolved with compensation from the Japanese side, and requesting a detailed reply from the files of the former Jiangsu Negotiation Office, the files of the Jiangsu Negotiation Office have been sent to the ministry for preservation and cannot be reviewed.  A letter was sent to the ministry to instruct the department to investigate and reply. Now, according to a reply from the International Affairs Department of the ministry, after reviewing the files of the Jiangsu Negotiation Office regarding the May 30th Incident, in addition to the death investigation table for the incident, which lists the deceased as Zhan Zhongbing and Luo Wenzhao, and the wounded as Zhang Huihua and Zhong Xiuwen, there are no files regarding the above-mentioned separate compensation resolution by the Japanese side.  Furthermore, according to a statement by the former negotiator Xu, this matter was resolved through negotiations between the Japanese side and the families of the victims or was not filed with the office. Since the association wants to understand the truth of this matter, it should send personnel to investigate the matter with the Japanese consulate in Shanghai to facilitate a response. Furthermore, after inquiring with the Japanese consul, who has since left, it was reported that after inspecting all records of this office regarding the Xiaoshadu Road incident, there is no record of separate compensation by our side. Therefore, it is not possible to ascertain to whom the funds were paid, the date, or the location. In addition to further investigation, the relevant circumstances are summarized and sent for your information. Best regards, to the Relatives Association of Martyrs Who Died in the May 30th Incident, Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, June 9th.</p>
<h3>Arsenal Staff</h3>
<h3>Donating Salaries to Compensate the Families of Deceased Workers</h3>
<p>Twenty-five workers were killed or seriously injured and died in the Arsenal's ammunition loading room explosion. Factory Director Guo Chengen submitted a request to the General Headquarters for generous compensation. The General Headquarters approved a compensation payment of 500 yuan per person. However, after deducting the burial expenses of 120 yuan, the family members received 380 yuan. It is heard that Factory Director Guo has convened meetings with the department and section chiefs of the factory in recent days, including Xu Shaoqu and Kuang Yiji, to discuss methods of raising funds through salary donations from staff members. It is planned to invite department and section staff members to donate voluntarily. Once the funds are collected, they will be distributed in full to the families of the deceased workers to show sympathy and aid orphans and widows.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Land Bureau</h3>
<h3>Unifies the Collection of Deed Taxes in Each District</h3>
<p>Five Yuan Collected for Every Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau's handling of the issuance of real estate deeds and the collection of taxes is a continuation of old customs, with variations in each district. Therefore, within the same city, the collection ranges from as high as six yuan per hundred yuan to as low as three yuan and five jiao per hundred yuan. The burden on the people is uneven. In the past, the funds were distributed to each district for specific local undertakings, so the amount of collection also varied according to local conditions. Now, the old items collected have long been abolished by the municipal conference and renamed as municipal expenses. All income is uniformly deposited into the municipal treasury and distributed according to the budget. Therefore, the amount of collection in each district should be consistent. In view of this, the Land Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government the other day to change the collection to five yuan per hundred yuan of the deed price. The amount of collection is now consistent, the burden on the people is also average, and the excess from one area can be used to compensate for the deficiency in another, so that the income of the municipal treasury will not be short.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Publicity to Eliminate Rice Stem Borers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in view of the increasing prevalence of rice stem borer infestations in recent years, previously compiled and printed "A Simple Explanation of Eliminating Rice Stem Borers," "Rice Stem Borer Elimination Monthly Calendar," illustrated slogans, and purchased tools for eliminating rice stem borers and rice stem borer specimens. Personnel were dispatched to various districts in the city to conduct publicity and select several districts with heavier rice stem borer damage to pilot cooperative rice stem borer elimination. Six test areas were set up to promote awareness among the city's farmers regarding the damage caused by rice stem borers to rice ears (commonly known as white rice heads). However, they have not been able to implement the methods to completely eliminate the rice stem borer infestation. This year, the bureau expanded the agricultural cooperative test areas to six districts and forty-six sites. Among them, all seven rice cultivation test sites have been implementing rice stem borer elimination work, such as lighting lamps to attract moths, collecting eggs, catching moths, and removing withered hearts, in a timely manner. It is heard that the bureau received a letter from the Baoshan County Government yesterday stating that rice stem borer eggs have been discovered on the agricultural field of the Agricultural College of Labor University, requesting cooperative prevention and elimination. The bureau immediately sent a letter to the Agricultural College of the University, inviting personnel to jointly conduct publicity and encourage farmers to implement rice stem borer elimination work according to the methods in the Wusong and Jiangwan districts at ten o'clock on the mornings of today and tomorrow. For other districts, such as Luxing, Gaohang, and Caojing, the bureau will dispatch special personnel to carry books, "A Simple Explanation of Eliminating Rice Stem Borers," "Rice Stem Borer Elimination Monthly Calendar," illustrated specimens, tools, and drawings to the countryside for distribution and lectures. At the same time, the municipal committee members in each district are instructed to supervise the farmers in the district to work hard to eliminate rice stem borers in order to prevent infestations.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Representatives' Congress</h3>
<p>The Business Reorganization Association is scheduled to convene a general meeting of representatives from various industries on the 21st of this month to formally establish the Chamber of Commerce. All procedures are being actively prepared. The following is a record of yesterday's news:</p>
<p>Various Agencies Approve the Convening</p>
<p>After the association decided to convene the representatives' congress, it submitted a report to the National Government's Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the city's party and government agencies requesting approval. The National Government's Secretariat, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Party Department, the People's Training Committee, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau have successively replied, granting approval for filing.</p>
<p>Industry Preparatory Committees Participate</p>
<p>The association yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal People's Training Committee, reporting that the preparatory committees of various industry associations were permitted to send representatives to participate in the congress. The original letter stated, "In accordance with the fact that our association has scheduled a meeting of representatives of industry associations on June 21, all industry associations reorganized under the guidance of our association, as well as the industry reorganization committees established by merging more than one organization, have been notified to send representatives to attend the congress in accordance with the law. However, some newly organized industry associations are still in the process of preparing in accordance with the law. Although these associations have not completed the procedure for approval and establishment as defined in Article 3 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations, whether they were preparing before or after the issuance of People's Training Committee Notice No. 7, they have all undergone the procedure of being permitted to establish by the People's Training Committee. According to Article 12 of the Law on Chambers of Commerce, under these circumstances, it is necessary to recognize that the industry already has an association organization. Even if it has not gone through the procedure of Article 3 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations, it cannot obtain the same legal status as those that have been formally established. However, on the one hand, the companies and firms in the industry do not need to join the chamber of commerce individually because they already have an association organization, and on the other hand, the association itself cannot send representatives to join the chamber of commerce like stores that do not have an association organization because it has not been formally established. Considering the principles and understanding the business situation, this seems unreasonable and loses its fairness. Therefore, on the 7th of this month, the preparatory industry associations were allowed to send representatives to participate in the industry association representatives' congress on June 21. However, the number of representatives should not exceed three, based on the example of store members, to show the difference from the formally established industry associations. A separate letter was sent to the People's Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau for filing." It should be recorded, announced, and followed accordingly.</p>
<p>Organization of Street Vendors Still Not Permitted</p>
<p>Previously, the association submitted reasons to the Central Training Department requesting permission to organize in accordance with the law for all street vendor industries, because the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had approved that street vendor industries should not organize industry associations in accordance with the law. Now, Directive No. 2553 from the Central Training Department has been received, stating, "The telegram has been noted. The Law on Chambers of Commerce stipulates that associations and stores are members, and the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations stipulates that companies and firms are members. Their organizations are all legal entities. If peddlers and stall vendors are natural persons, they cannot, in accordance with the law, have a trade association or branch. If there are difficulties in handling, they can be explained in detail. The statement that the nature of the street vendor industry in the city is not mobile is true, but its business lacks fixed standards and is not relatively permanent. If there is a group organization, it will inevitably increase the burden and directly affect the business. Therefore, the fact that the street vendor industry is not regulated is precisely to protect its interests and is not unequal treatment. The requested items should not be discussed and should be followed accordingly."</p>
<p>Membership of Foreign-Funded and Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Stores</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of whether foreign-funded and Sino-foreign joint venture stores can join the association, the association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday requesting instructions. "Article 20 of the Law on Chambers of Commerce states that commercial legal entities or stores without the organization of the same industry or with the same industry but without the organization of the same industry association may be store members of the chamber of commerce. Article 10 of the same law states that member representatives must be citizens of the Republic of China who are engaged in business in the area and are over 25 years old. The commercial situation in the city is more complicated. In addition to those established by purely Chinese merchants, the above-mentioned commercial legal entities or stores are established by Sino-foreign joint ventures or purely foreign merchants. If this purely foreign-funded or Sino-foreign joint venture commercial legal entity or store B registers in accordance with the law in the government office of the country it favors in accordance with Article 11 of the Implementing Rules of the Law on Chambers of Commerce and obtains the qualification of a Chinese commercial legal entity, and in accordance with Article 10 of the Law on Chambers of Commerce, sends its Chinese manager as a member representative to request to join the chamber of commerce, there are doubts as to whether it can be allowed in accordance with the provisions of the law. Furthermore, the former General Chamber of Commerce did not investigate the nationality of the company but recognized them as individual members because Article 6, Paragraphs 1 and 3 of the old commercial law had provisions that individuals could be qualified to manage and join the association. Now that the Law on Chambers of Commerce does not adopt this provision, the above-mentioned member representative will inevitably have legal problems. Therefore, the 53rd Standing Committee meeting of the affiliated association on the 7th of this month decided to submit a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review and approval. It is truly a public convenience to seek instructions from your ministry."</p>

<h3>Public Security Funding for Shanghai and Bao’shan Counties</h3>
<p>The liquidation of public security funding for Shanghai County, which has been suspended since the municipal government ceased allocations, is about to begin. Although meetings have been held by the city government to discuss the matter, no concrete solution has been reached. However, public security funding is crucial to local治安 stability, so County Magistrate Yan personally went to the provincial capital last month to seek instructions for a solution. It is reported that the province now has a proposed solution: the first step is to have Shanghai and Bao’shan Counties jointly liquidate with the municipal government. If there is a shortfall after the liquidation, it will be subsidized by the Finance Department. Yesterday, the Shanghai County Government received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stating, “For your information, regarding the Provincial Government Instruction No. 3083, the Provincial Government’s Instruction No. 3083 states that item 12 of the agenda discussed at the 297th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee, Hu Pu'an, concurrently the Commissioner of Civil Affairs, proposed the matter of the relationship between the public security funding of Shanghai and Bao’shan Counties and the public security funding of the Shanghai Municipality. It was resolved to order the Finance Department to send personnel to jointly liquidate with the Shanghai Municipal Government, etc. In addition to forwarding to the Finance Department, it is hereby ordered that your department be informed for your notification.” Therefore, in addition to forwarding it to other departments, it is ordered to inform the county magistrate for notification. It is heard that the Finance Department will appoint the Director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau as the principal liquidation commissioner to liaise with the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the public security funding of Shanghai and Bao’shan Counties.

<p>Minhang West Township</p>
<h3>Hailstorm Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Crops and cotton destroyed, autumn harvest hopeless. Farmers cry out and petition for relief.</p>
<p>In the He Xiang Bridge area of Minhang Town, Shanghai County, on the afternoon of the 7th of this month, suddenly dark clouds gathered, and a fierce wind and rainstorm descended, with hailstones lasting for about three-quarters of an hour. The accumulated hailstones were over a foot high, and the largest ones weighed over three pounds, which is rarely seen in history. As a result, crops and cotton were completely destroyed, and people and livestock were injured. Within ten miles, it was a scene of bare earth. Farmers, facing this extraordinary disaster, were in extreme pain. Yesterday, the township heads in the area submitted a petition to the First District Office, requesting them to send personnel to conduct on-site investigations and find ways to provide relief. The original petition is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition for sudden extraordinary disaster, crops and cotton completely destroyed, requesting a swift dispatch of personnel for on-site investigation and relief. It is respectfully reported that in the township jurisdiction, at 3 PM on the 7th of this month, suddenly dark clouds gathered, and a fierce wind and rainstorm descended, with hailstones as large as goose eggs lasting for about three-quarters of an hour, accumulating over a foot thick, which is a rare disaster in history. Many people and livestock were injured, and countless melons, beans, and vegetables were damaged. In particular, the crops and cotton in the fields were in the stage of sprouting, and the stems and leaves were still tender. After being hit by the hailstones, it was a scene of bare earth, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Farmers are all lamenting to each other, feeling extreme pain. Seeing this situation is truly pitiable. The previous planting was affected by the high price of rice, and we worked hard to manage it. Now, facing this extraordinary disaster, all efforts have been wasted. If we allow it to become barren, the hungry will have no means of survival. If we want to plant in time, it is difficult to do so suddenly because the majority of families are empty-handed. If there is no way to improve the situation, the future hardship is unimaginable. We have witnessed this and feel heartbroken and cannot sit idly by. Therefore, we specifically submit this petition, requesting your prompt dispatch of personnel to go to the villages for on-site investigation and find ways to provide relief to maintain people's livelihood. We are awaiting your urgent orders with great anticipation. Respectfully submitted by the water police patrol officer.</p>
<h3>Accepting a Bribe of 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Releasing tens of thousands of yuan worth of opium. The case was discovered several weeks later. The bribery is exposed, and the patrol officer is arrested.</p>
<p>Du Guorui, patrol officer No. 5 of the Fourth Squad of the 17th Team of the Wusong Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, was recently ordered to lead a patrol boat from Jiangbei to escort pig boats sailing to Shanghai. In the waters outside Wusongkou, he spotted a large iron-hulled barge with people unloading dozens of sacks onto a small sailboat. Patrol Officer Du suspected that the ship and others were extremely suspicious and immediately sailed to inspect. Unexpectedly, when the ship and others saw the patrol boat, they immediately set sail to escape. Patrol Officer Du then ordered the water police to fire a blank shot at the ship and others. The crew of the iron-hulled barge, seeing the patrol boat firing, immediately stopped the ship and waved to the patrol boat, instructing them not to fire again. The patrol boat then sailed alongside the iron-hulled barge and the small sailboat to inspect. Unexpectedly, a large amount of opium, worth tens of thousands of yuan, was found in the ship. The ship's crew was quite cunning and immediately pleaded with Patrol Officer Du, willing to offer a bribe of 3,000 yuan to release them. Patrol Officer Du was blinded by greed and forgot his duty. He actually agreed. Later, the iron-hulled barge sailed to Songkou, and the ship's crew immediately handed over the 3,000 yuan bribe to Patrol Officer Du, and the iron-hulled barge was immediately released. This incident occurred several weeks ago, and it was not until the day before yesterday that it was discovered by Zhu Junfu, the district chief of the Fourth District. District Chief Zhu believed that Patrol Officer Du was suspected of accepting bribes and releasing a large quantity of drugs, and the case was serious. He has arrested Patrol Officer Du and ordered Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th Team, to truthfully investigate and punish him according to the law.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Purchase New Locomotives</h3>
<p>Costing over one million yuan.</p>
<p>Recently, to increase traffic and promote transportation, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway authorities ordered 18 of the latest locomotive engines from England, costing a total of over one million silver dollars. It is reported that one million yuan was allocated from the Boxer Indemnity funds for this expense, and Director Liu Wei-chi has submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways for approval.</p>
<p>Wusong to Establish</p>
<h3>Seaside Public Hospital</h3>
<p>First establish a temporary epidemic hospital.</p>
<p>Since Wusong was placed under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, it has been designated as a model sanitary district, and the municipal facilities have gradually been completed. As a result, the development of commerce and the prosperity of residents have far surpassed the past. However, a fully organized hospital is still lacking. Recently, Tang Zuanzhi, Zhang Yuchi, Jiang Yisheng, and others initiated the construction of a large-scale hospital, selecting the site of the Jide Hall next to the Ningbo Merchants Fire Brigade on the Outer Bund as the hospital site. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that the hospital preparatory committee has been established, and the standing committee members have held repeated meetings to proceed with the project. The main resolutions of the meeting are excerpted as follows: (1) First establish a temporary hospital to treat emergencies and epidemic diseases, which will be the responsibility of the standing committee members. The regular expenses are tentatively set at 2,000 yuan per year, and the local government will provide public assistance according to past precedents. The medical services will be provided by the Medical College of Central University and Tongji University. (A) The name of the hospital will be decided by the majority of the committee members after the replies are received. (B) Zhang Yuchi and Jiang Yisheng will contact the former epidemic hospital to discuss the transfer of management and the transfer of existing funds and medicines. (C) The chairman will send a letter to invite Jiang Yisheng to serve as the honorary director of the temporary hospital, Miao Binfu as the director of the economic section, and Yan Fuqing, Zhu Hengbi, Lai Douyan, Liang Zhiyan, Gu Jingqian, and Cao Wengui as medical advisors. (2) (A) Because there are no suitable houses that can be temporarily borrowed, a portion of the houses will be built on the hospital site (i.e., the site of Jide Hall). The construction cost is limited to 2,500 yuan, and the equipment cost is 500 yuan. Tongji University and the Medical College of Central University will each advance 1,000 yuan, and Zhang Yuchi, Jiang Yisheng, and Tang Zuanzhi will jointly advance 1,000 yuan. These will be repaid without interest after the formal donations are collected. (B) Before the completion of the hospital, the Guangyi Shantang and Yiwu Photography Studio will be temporarily used. (C) The hospital will be named Seaside Public Hospital Temporary Epidemic Hospital.</p>
<p>Unexpected Disaster Occurs</p>
<h3>A Woman Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Russian Hong, driving drunk, crashes directly into a rickshaw. Qu Gongshi is directly hit and dies from severe injuries.</p>
<p>Qu Guisheng, 38 years old, from Gujia Lane, Pudong, works as a steward at the residence of a foreign merchant, Mr. Joseph, at No. 810 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. His wife, Gongshi, 26 years old, is his third wife, and they rent a place on the upper floor of the Shengji Bicycle Shop at No. 170 Avenue Albert. The woman went out to buy things after dinner the night before and met a relative. They went to the Great World amusement park together. When they left the park after midnight, she and her relatives walked to the front of the Empire Theatre on Avenue Joffre. It was already 12:45 AM. Her relative wanted to invite her to a late-night snack shop for refreshments. She declined, saying that she had already had dinner and felt tired and sleepy, so she was eager to go home to sleep. She hired a rickshaw that was parked on the roadside. The rickshaw puller asked for 20 cents, and she didn't bargain and immediately jumped into the rickshaw, telling the rickshaw puller to go quickly. The rickshaw puller had just lifted the shafts and started to walk westward for a few steps when a drunken Russian, Mr. Jia, driving a car from west to east on the north side of Avenue Joffre, speeding recklessly. The Russian, because he was drunk, lost control of the car, causing the car to veer southward into the path of the rickshaw, which was traveling westward. The car crashed into the rickshaw, hitting the woman in the head, causing her to bleed profusely and immediately lose consciousness. She was also bruised on her body. The rickshaw was smashed to pieces, and the rickshaw puller's legs were bruised. At this point, the car also stopped due to damaged parts from the impact. The police arrived and first took the injured people to Renji Hospital for treatment. They also took the Russian, the car, and the rickshaw to the Songshan Road Police Station. After the police chief questioned him, the Russian was still drunk and unaware that he was driving without a license. The family of the deceased has hired a lawyer to negotiate a settlement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Maid Throws Herself into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Unable to bear the oppression of her master. Fortunately, an Englishman came to the rescue.</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM yesterday morning, a young Japanese woman hired a sampan from Hongkou to cross the Huangpu River. The woman suddenly came out of the cabin and attempted to drown herself in the river. Fortunately, two Englishmen on the same boat noticed and stopped her, questioning her about the reason for her suicide. She refused to reveal the truth and only sobbed. When the boat arrived at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong, the two Englishmen handed her over to the dock police, who took her to the Third District Police Station. That night, she was transferred to the district. The woman could read Chinese and wrote her name as Yamaguchi Akiko, 20 years old, from Nagasaki, Japan. She is currently working as a maid at the Ikyutei Japanese Restaurant on Zhapu Road in Shanghai. Because she could not bear the oppression of her master and felt depressed, she wanted to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river. The district chief, considering that the case involved a Japanese woman being forced to commit suicide, ordered that she be sent to the Public Security Bureau for rescue.</p>
<p>Russian forcibly defiles</p>
<h3>A Twelve-Year-Old Chinese Girl</h3>
<p>The doctor has confirmed the injury. The police should investigate strictly.</p>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, a local girl, Wang Zhaodi, only twelve years old, was seen by Post 1743 being held in the arms of a Russian man near the Zhapu Road Bridge in the Public Concession, in a strange manner. When the police approached to question them, the Russian man immediately released Zhaodi and fled into the darkness. Zhaodi burst into tears and told the police that she had been sexually assaulted by the Russian man and that her private parts were injured. She was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by the police car. After the doctor examined her, it was confirmed that she had been defiled.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trial</p>
<h3>The Tang Zairu Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Tang personally appeared in court to testify, attempting to exonerate the kidnappers.</p>
<p>Tang Zairu, a staff member of the Bank of Communications from Huzhou, was kidnapped on April 21 at 9:30 AM while traveling to work from his residence at No. 617 Xinza Road in his own car. Fortunately, he escaped, and the police arrested Xue Heshang from Chongming. The Special District Court ordered him to be detained pending the arrival of the victim to testify. After escaping, Tang suffered from shock and returned to his hometown to recuperate. He has now recovered and come to Shanghai from his hometown.</p>
<p>The case was heard yesterday morning, and Tang also appeared in court. According to him, there were four kidnappers in total. Two of them held pistols and fired two shots as a warning. They kidnapped me and put a pair of black glasses on my nose. When we arrived at a place, I was kept upstairs for about ten hours and then moved to another place, still kept upstairs for two days. Then I was moved into the Huangpu River, into a barge, and hidden in the hold. Three people were assigned to guard me. The defendant, Yan Heshang, was one of the guards. Unexpectedly, it rained the next day, and water seeped into the bottom of the boat, filling it to about a foot. My clothes and shoes were soaked. The guards also couldn't bear it, and we complained to each other. From their words, I knew that their conscience had not been extinguished, so I asked them to release me. At first, the leader of the group firmly refused, saying that he couldn't help me. After I promised to reward them, they agreed. On the fifth day, the defendant and another guard escorted me ashore and sent me home. I rewarded the defendant 1,200 yuan, and the other person 600 yuan. I also ordered the defendant to give 600 yuan to the one still on the boat. Although I saw two pistols on the boat for several days, the defendants did not use them.</p>
<p>Questioned about it, Yan Heshang testified that the owner of the barge, Mr. Jia, said when he put the plaintiff on the boat that this person was an old hand at handling goods. Later, he learned that he was a kidnapped wealthy man. Because he begged for help, he released him. I was just a crew member on the boat. After the plaintiff returned home, he gave me money, which I took back and gave to the boat owner and another person. Later, the boat owner gave me twenty yuan, etc. He hired lawyer Lu Qi to defend him. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<p>Qian Kunyu's left-behind concubine</p>
<h3>Accuses Her Son of Neglecting Support</h3>
<p>Living expenses suddenly stopped. Debts accumulate to 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Qian Kunyu, a native of Ningbo, started his career as a businessman and accumulated over a million yuan in his later years. In 1909, Qian Kunyu divided all his property into seven shares. In addition to setting aside one share for his own living expenses, the remaining six shares were divided among his six sons, Zongqing, Zongming, Zongde, Zongxiang, Zongying, and Zongfu. His daughter, Rongbao, did not receive a share. In 1913, Qian Kunyu died. Of the seven wives and concubines he left behind, only one, Ms. Chen, the mother of Zongying and Zongfu, is still alive. Ms. Chen has hired a lawyer to sue the six sons in the Special District Court for neglecting to provide support. The trial opened yesterday morning. Zongming, Zongde, and Zongxiang, among the defendants, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend them.</p>
<p>First, the lawyer for the plaintiff, Chen, stated that the share of property set aside by Kunyu for his own living expenses was worth over ten thousand yuan. The Yuanchang Kunji Hardware Store was jointly managed by the six sons, with the eldest son, Zongqing, as the manager. After Kunyu's death, the plaintiff's living expenses were paid by Yuanchang. However, payment suddenly stopped over ten years later, leaving the plaintiff with no means of survival and forced to borrow money to make ends meet, accumulating debts of 12,000 yuan. The defendants' neglect of support is obvious, so she filed a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jiang then argued that the defendant Zongming had also passed away and was succeeded by his son, Gengsheng. Qian Kunyu divided the property during his lifetime to prevent disputes in the future and to ensure that each son supported his mother. The plaintiff had two sons and should have received property, which the plaintiff managed on their behalf. How could the plaintiff have accumulated debts? His client does not have the obligation to provide support. The lawyers for the other defendants also argued in succession. Judge Xu instructed them to reschedule the trial and advised both parties to settle out of court.</p>
<p>Married woman</p>
<h3>Sues for Property Division, Rebutted</h3>
<p>Dai Gengxin Wins the Case, Sister's Request for Property Division Denied</p>
<p>Dai Gengxin, the owner of the Huacheng Tobacco Company, and his brothers, Genghua and Ziyu, have recently been sued in the Special District Court by their married sister, Lu Dai Cuidi, who hired a lawyer to divide the public property and Yizhuang School funds totaling over 110,000 yuan left by their deceased father, Yunlai. The defendants also hired lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Yiping to defend them. After review, the case has been adjourned for judgment. At 9:00 AM, they waited for instructions in the Seventh Tribunal. Judge Xu took the bench and announced the judgment. The main text of the judgment stated: The plaintiff's lawsuit is rejected, and the litigation costs are to be borne by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Municipal Public Works Bureau</p>
<h3>Renames Various Shipping Offices</h3>
<p>The shipping offices under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Works Bureau include the General Shipping Office in Dongjiadu, the Wusong River Shipping Office at Xinza Bridge, and the Chenjiadu Shipping Sub-Office in Chenjiadu. In fact, all shipping offices are directly under the bureau, and the above names are based on the order of their establishment and do not have a mutually subordinate relationship. Recently, the bureau considered it necessary to change these names and specially obtained the approval of the Municipal Government to change the names of the various shipping offices to the names of the areas where they are located, following the example of the various transportation offices. The Dongjiadu General Shipping Office was renamed the South Shanghai Shipping Office, the Wusong River Shipping Office was renamed the Shanghai Shipping Office, and the Chenjiadu Shipping Sub-Office was renamed the Pusong Shipping Office.</p>
<p>Central Research Institute Sends Personnel</p>
<h3>To Europe to Investigate Journalism</h3>
<p>The Central Research Institute has selected Cheng Ping, an overseas researcher from the Institute of Social Sciences, to go to Europe to investigate the journalism industry in various countries. Cheng arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday morning and stayed at the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road. He is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 14th, together with Liu Kejian, the representative sent to Belgium to attend the Criminal Punishment Conference, on the French postal ship "Andr朋da朋".</p>
<p>Arson for Insurance Compensation Case</p>
<h3>Masterminds Also Deserve Their Punishment</h3>
<p>Su Renqing Sentenced to Ten Years, Wang Zongxiang to Seven Years</p>
<p>The Guangrentang Pharmacy on Avenue Edward VII suddenly caught fire at the end of last year. After the police investigated, it was found that it was arson to claim insurance money. After strict investigation, Wang Zongxiang, the store owner from Kunshan, fled out of fear of punishment. Zheng Zhaoxiang, the manager, was detained and sent to the former Provisional Court for trial, and was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Zheng's daughter believed that her father was deceived by the insurance broker, Su Renqing, from Shanghai, and that the whole incident was caused by Su, who deposited empty boxes in the pharmacy and insured them for a huge amount of fire insurance, and then incited the store owner to flee when the incident occurred, causing her father to bear the sole responsibility. She was very unwilling to let this happen, so she investigated the whereabouts of Wang Zongxiang and discovered them. She reported it to the Xinza Police Station, which ordered Detective Tao Afu to arrest Wang first. Wang also claimed that Su was the mastermind, so Su was arrested again. After repeated trials, the facts were verified. Yesterday morning, the police brought Wang and Su to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the Special District Court for sentencing. Judge Wu Tingqi took the bench and announced the judgment: Su Renqing was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, and Wang Zongxiang was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention shall be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day.</p>
<p>Qian Kunyu's Left-Behind Concubine</p>
<h3>The Wife Was Stabbed to Death by Her Husband</h3>
<p>Mao Genyang Claims It Was Not Intentional. Judge Feng Personally Inspected the Residence</p>
<p>Mao Genyang, a native of Ningbo who sells beef at No. 47 Zhoushan Road, stabbed his wife, Ms. Zhong, in the waist because she prevented him from arguing with his sister over a debt and excessive interest. The police detained Mao and sent him to the Special District Court for questioning. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. Ms. Zhong died at Guangren Hospital at 1:00 AM on the morning of the third due to her serious injuries. An autopsy was performed, and the remains were ordered to be collected. Mao's criminal responsibility was therefore increased. He was charged with murder by the police yesterday morning. Judge Feng questioned him. According to the police lawyer, the autopsy showed that the deceased had been stabbed in the waist to a depth of two inches, and the defendant had intentionally killed her. Judge Feng said to the defendant: I have personally visited the scene of the incident and investigated the location of the refrigerator and your wife. If the knife had fallen from the refrigerator, it would not have stabbed her in the left waist. The defendant insisted that the incident was unintentional. According to Mao Qianchang, the son of the deceased, my mother told me in the hospital that my father had stabbed her unintentionally. According to Zhong Caifeng, the sister of the deceased, when I visited my sister in the hospital, she said that the disaster was caused by her husband's sister demanding the debt. Finally, the defendant stated that his wife and he had always been on good terms and that this was an accidental injury. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Russian Died Strangely</h3>
<p>Could not determine the disease he was suffering from.</p>
<p>A Russian named Yarokoff, a member of the Western Merchants Corps, who was working at the Xilao at Xiamen Road, suddenly died without any illness on the evening of the 7th. The Zhabei Police Station reported the incident and sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu of the Special District Court went to the morgue for an autopsy but could not determine the cause of death. Dr. Bai of the Western Hospital could not determine the disease he was suffering from, so an autopsy is still needed.</p>
<h3>University Student Sues Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>It Is Not Known Who Is Right and Who Is Wrong, Awaiting Police Investigation</p>
<p>Zhong Huiming, a university student from a university on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession, reported to the French Police the day before yesterday that he had hired a rickshaw from a certain rickshaw company to take his friend who was leaving for another port to the ship码头码头. For some unknown reason, the rickshaw puller, Xu Fengzhang, and his friend started scuffling with each other. After they were separated, the student still sat in the rickshaw to return to his residence. Xu, however, was angered and gathered several colleagues to beat me. I was injured and request to be investigated. The police chief approved the request and ordered the detectives to arrest Xu. The case was brought to the French Court for investigation.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiff complained about the previous situation. When Xu Fengzhang was questioned, he testified that the plaintiff had agreed on a price of one and a half yuan when he hired the rickshaw that day. However, because the time was too long, the common people requested to increase the fare. Unexpectedly, not only did they not agree, but they were also beaten. The common people did not dare to commit violence and requested an investigation. Judge Zhu told both parties that it was not known who was right and who was wrong, and ordered the police to investigate in detail and then verify.</p>
<h3>Beating an Apprentice to Death Case Judgment</h3>
<p>Master Is Jailed for Six Months, Compensation of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Liu Meishi, a widow from Wenzhou, had a thirteen-year-old son named Liu Caidong. He was an apprentice at the Wanhua Cheng Laundry on Avenue Lyautey in the French Concession. Last month, he was kicked by his master, Hu Atong, for not being careful when drying clothes, which caused him to be injured and die. The police arrested Hu and brought him to the French Court, which ordered both parties to settle out of court. It was brought up again for questioning yesterday. The Western Detective Chief reported that the defendant was still detained in the police station because no one had guaranteed him. No one had been sent to settle with the plaintiff. He requested to be investigated. Hu Atong testified that he was unable to consult with the plaintiff because he was in custody. He requested to be released to handle the matter. Judge Zhu sentenced Hu to six months in the Western Jail and ordered him to pay the plaintiff a compensation of 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Breaking a Window to Steal Cotton</h3>
<p>The lookout escaped, and the thief was arrested.</p>
<p>The thief, He Xiaoliu, 24 years old, from Shanyang, broke into the Longmao Warehouse in Lujiazui, Pudong, late the other night with his accomplices, Xiaowuzi and Xiaoxiazi. Xiaowuzi and Xiaoxiazi were on the lookout outside, and Xiaoliu broke the glass window of the warehouse to steal more than 40 catties of cotton. He was about to come out when he was caught by the patrol police, who detained the people and the stolen goods. The two lookouts had already escaped. The people and the stolen goods were taken to the Third District. The stolen goods were taken away by the warehouse, and He Xiaoliu was taken to the Public Security Bureau for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Opium Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>The First Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau discovered two sacks of opium being transported in a rickshaw. The transporter, Qian Degen, was arrested and transferred to the Local Court for investigation. After the investigation was completed, he was charged with a crime. However, the originally handling patrol officer, Huang Genrong, suddenly testified that the person caught at the time was a car with a total of five bags of opium, involving patrol officer Wang Wencai and the dismissed district chief. In order to completely eliminate the poison, the court recognized that this matter had caused a huge uproar, so it ordered an investigation and then verification. Now that the investigation has been completed, the court again heard the case yesterday with Judge Deng presiding.</p>
<p>The defendant, Qian Degen, testified that Chen Laosi had asked me to deliver it to the iron gate of the Big Bell Tower, and someone would pick it up. I got two yuan. At that time, it was indeed two bags loaded by a rickshaw. I am not taking the blame for someone else. The official then summoned Huang Zhenrong and said that according to you, the car was chartered, and the lease number of the French Concession was 11532, and the lease number of the Chinese Concession was 2723. This court has verified that it is from the Dachang Taxi Company in the French Concession. They claimed that this car had not been used for business. They were lying because of Wang Wencai's words. However, the Public Security Bureau in this case has also verified that the car was not used for business, etc.</p>
<p>The official said that since Qian Degen admitted to transporting the soil, the remaining parts could not be combined with this case. Therefore, he asked Prosecutor Xu to attend the court to discuss his opinion. Then, the defense lawyer, Zhou Yu, argued that Qian Degen was a worker. He did not dare to say whether the district chief or patrol officer had committed fraud, but he was ultimately taking the blame for someone else. He requested leniency. After asking and declaring the end of the debate, the court scheduled a date for sentencing and remanded the defendant in custody.</p>
<h3>Seduction of a Minor Girl</h3>
<p>Cao Qianfa's actions are truly unlawful. The Laolaji Bridge No. 288, Lao Chen Tai Flour Shop is run by Zhu Yongqing, a Changshu native, and the business is doing quite well. Zhu is 45 years old, his wife, Ms. Gu, is young, and they have a daughter named Zhao Gen (also known as Gen Nü), who is now 17 years old. She has bright eyes and beautiful teeth and possesses remarkable beauty. She once attended a nearby girls' school, so she has some basic knowledge of literature. Zhu has a friend named Xu Jinsheng, with whom he has a close relationship and often visits. This year, in the fourth month of the lunar calendar, Xu, along with his friend Cao Qianfa, came to Zhu's shop. Zhu treated them hospitably as friends of his friend. Little did he know that Cao was a frivolous young man with a lustful heart. Seeing Zhao Gen's beautiful appearance, he was drooling with desire and used every opportunity to seduce her under the guise of visiting. Zhao Gen, seeing Xu's refined demeanor, also fell in love, and soon they became intimately involved in a secret love affair, unbeknownst to Zhu. However, Cao, knowing that it would be difficult to form a proper marriage, instigated Zhao Gen to run away a few days ago and hide in a paint shop opposite Guoging Tong Road, Xin Yongsheng Road, where they cohabited. Zhu, after his beloved daughter disappeared, was extremely angry and searched everywhere. The previous evening, he happened to pass by Gonghe Road in Zhabei and encountered Xu Jinsheng, whom he immediately confronted, demanding the return of his daughter. He then reported the matter to the responsible Fourth District General Office, which dispatched detectives to Cao's residence, where they arrested Cao, Zhao Gen, and the related party Jiang Genqian for questioning. According to Cao's confession, he is a 24-year-old from Baoshan. Zhao Gen willingly came with him, and he did not dare to abduct her, only sleeping with her for one night. According to Zhao Gen's confession, she was momentarily confused and deeply regrets her mistake. She wishes to return home with her father and reform herself. Director Jin, upon reviewing the confessions, determined that Cao Qianfa's seduction of a minor girl was unlawful and should be handed over to the Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Arrests Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around ten o'clock, Huan Guanlin, a detective from the Third District of the Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Water Police Bureau stationed in Shanghai, informed the Fourth District Public Security Bureau that the nine-year-old son of Xi Yaozisheng of Jiashan County had been kidnapped by Lu Chengliang and others in April of this year.

<h3>Tobacco Exchange Industry to Hold Reorganization Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Statistics show that there are over 5,000 tobacco exchange businesses, large and small, in the Chinese Concession of this city. Over 3,000 businesses have joined the current round of filling out the declaration book. The previously scheduled voting election this month was rushed and could not be held in time. It is now reported that there are still sham businesses that specialize in exchanging inferior coins and selling smuggled goods, hanging up signs to sell at low prices, deliberately disrupting regulations, and some even set up gambling dens and opium dens, harming society and undermining the reputation of the entire industry. The association, in view of the complex qualifications for this election, must carefully consider this matter and has scheduled the seventh reorganization committee meeting to be held this Tuesday to prepare for a thorough investigation. All committee members have been notified to inform all legitimate businesses that have not yet filled out their applications to submit them to the association within three days for compilation into the list for re-election. All former addresses of the three original groups will be temporarily changed to district reorganization committee communication offices.</p>

<h3>Man Dies on Wasteland at Baziqiao</h3>
<p>Autopsy confirms sudden illness. A nameless male corpse was found lying on the wasteland in front of the Baziqiao Siming Guild Hall in Zhabei yesterday. He was about fifty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, resembling a worker. The Fifth District Police Station sent a summons to the local bailiff Wang Jinfu of the 91st ward to report to the local court. Prosecutor Zhao, commissioned by the court, along with coroners, arrived at the scene and determined that the deceased had died from a sudden illness.

<h3>Rice Boat Wang Guangfu Robbed</h3>
<p>The rice boat Wang Guangfu recently transported 160 shi of white rice from Zhang Jinchan's place to Shanghai for sale. The rice was sold out the day before yesterday, and the proceeds were used to purchase 200 bags of bran for sale inland. The day before yesterday afternoon, while sailing near Nan Huangpu Doufubang, two small boats of robbers suddenly approached and ordered the Wang boat to stop. The Wang boat ignored them, and the robbers fired two shots, one of which hit Wang's partner at the stern, entering his left arm. Wang and others, seeing their partner fall in pain, had no choice but to lower the sail and stop the boat. The robbers from the two small boats swarmed onto the boat. There were more than ten of them, armed with guns, knives, and sticks, saying, "You are not thinking for yourself." They grabbed Wang and said, "Tell us quickly and don't hide anything. Hand over the money." Wang, panicked, had no choice but to go to the stern and hand over the hundred or so dollars in small change. The robbers pressed Wang again, and he replied that he had nothing. The robbers, thinking Wang was cunning, tied him up with rope and searched everywhere, finding 300 dollars in the front cabin and a leather suitcase containing clothes and other items in the stern cabin. The robbers jumped back into the two robber boats and sped south. After the robbers left, the partner untied Wang. Wang thought that only a few people on the boat knew about the money hidden in the front cabin, so Wang suspected that the partner had colluded with the robbers. Yesterday, he sailed back to the leather market and sent the injured partner to Minhang Hospital for treatment. Wang took a car to Shanghai to borrow money from a certain firm in order to pay taxes and other expenses. Therefore, the various rice boats in Shanghai, upon hearing this, yesterday sent the money to the inland through a money exchange and dared not bring it back on the boat again.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society Concerned About Opium Seedlings in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Request the Civil Affairs Department to report on opium eradication statistics. Request the public to report on the truth about opium seedlings. The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, concerned about the spread of opium seedlings in northern Anhui, sent special officers Dai Bingheng and Qiao Qiming, a professor of agronomy at Jinling University, to conduct on-site inspections in the summer of 1928. After several months, they found that there were over 350,000 mu of opium seedlings in 17 counties, including Hefei, Fuyang, Hao County, and Suzhou County. At that time, they presented the National Government with various photographs and evidence of poisoning, requesting the immediate abolition of the Opium Seedling Inspection Bureau, which had caused the disaster in northern Anhui. However, according to reports from the public in various parts of the province, the opium seedlings in northern Anhui have not been completely eradicated. The Society has now received a report from the Anhui Provincial Department of Civil Affairs stating that the opium seedlings have been successively ordered to be eradicated by special commissioners and the magistrates of 26 counties. Except for the bandit areas of Hefei and Hao County, all other counties have been completely cleared. After receiving this report, the Society believes that the reports from the government and the public differ. It is unclear whether the opium seedlings in northern Anhui have been completely eradicated or whether they still need to be eradicated. A thorough investigation is needed to clarify the truth. In addition to writing to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to request the statistics of the mu of opium seedlings eradicated in each county and the report from the commissioners on the investigation of the 26 counties, the Society's investigation department has prepared a brief table for the investigation of opium seedlings in northern Anhui and distributed it to public groups and individuals in Hefei, Hao County, Taihe, Mengcheng, and other counties in northern Anhui for completion. The items are as follows: (1) Have the opium seedlings in your area been completely eradicated? (2) If not, how many mu are still left? (3) Is there a tax? How many yuan per mu? Who collects it? (4) Did your area issue a pledge not to plant opium seedlings in 1929? (5) Have commissioners come to the village for inspection? (6) Is there banditry in your area? (7) Is the current magistrate of your county strict about eradicating opium seedlings? (8) Do farmers still like to plant opium seedlings? (9) What crops are now planted on the former opium-growing land? (10) Other. Once the reports from both sides are collected, they will be statistically analyzed to clarify the truth about opium seedlings in northern Anhui. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Will Hold a Meeting.</p>
<h3>Discussing Methods to Salvage Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation recently received a joint letter from the Suzhou Gauze Satin Industry Union, the Yunjin Association, the Iron Loom Silk Weaving Industry Association, and the Suzhou Silk Industry Union, stating that the associations had submitted a petition to the government for relief because silk weaving raw materials were being seized. The reasons are: (1) This year, the weather has been cold and humid, and the silkworm season has been greatly reduced. Only 19 out of 10 silkworm raisers sold their cocoons, and only one out of ten silk reelers were successful. The raw materials have already been exhausted. (2) Japanese cocoon merchants, relying on the support of their government, are now using large sums of money to bribe local villagers to buy unincubated cocoons and are not hesitating to lower prices to collect cocoons everywhere. Fresh cocoons in the countryside around Suzhou have almost been completely absorbed, and the raw materials for machine weaving are bound to be cut off. Silk firms in all directions will also have no goods to collect and will not be able to open the market. (3) The government is currently promoting domestic silk, but if Japanese merchants are allowed to delve deeply into seizing raw materials, then in the future, the manufacturing of goods will inevitably be without raw materials, and purely domestic silk will soon disappear. (4) The decline of the silk weaving industry has reached its extreme. Now, with this blow of the seizure of raw materials, all the factories are bound to stop, and workers will have no work to change to, and their livelihoods will inevitably be impossible to maintain. After receiving the letter, the Federation plans to convene an emergency meeting of colleagues from the two provinces to discuss relief measures in the near future.</p>
<h3>Lecture on New Medical Techniques by Japanese Doctor Iwata</h3>
<p>Instinct Therapy. Dr. Iwata, a Japanese medical doctor, invented Instinctive Self-Therapy, which is the latest medical technique in the medical field. It is very popular in this country and has a high reputation. Many people have come to Shanghai to learn about it. Yesterday, he publicly gave a diagnosis at the Jingwu Athletic Association on North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge. About dozens of people came to seek treatment, all of whom had strange diseases. After being treated, they all said it was effective. It is now heard that he has been retained by friends in Shanghai and plans to convene the third session of training members starting immediately. He is temporarily staying at the Hirano residence in Kitamanari, Yokohama Bridge, North Sichuan Road, so that those who aspire to seek this technique can have a special opportunity.</p>
<h3>Second District Women's Association Held Re-election Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Second District Women's Association of this city held its second re-election meeting yesterday. Chairman Zhu Xingyin gave an opening speech. Representatives Xu Yefu from the Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Association and Wu Zhen from the First District Party Department gave speeches in succession. Then, the executive committee members Zhu Xingyin, Yuan Yijun, Yang Qiaozhen, Liu Jingzhen, and Li Chenghe were elected. The alternates were Min Rongqing and Wei Lianzhen. They were sworn into office on the spot.

<h3>This Year's Vaccination Work</h3>
<p>A total of 141,033 people vaccinated. The Municipal Health Bureau's smallpox vaccination work for this year ended at the end of May. Counting from the start of vaccination in October 1929 to May 1930, only one month was temporarily suspended due to the cold weather in January. During the remaining seven months in 1929, 52,524 people were vaccinated in the first three months of the year, and 88,509 people were vaccinated in the last four months of the year, for a total of 141,033 people vaccinated. The above total includes the number of people vaccinated by various organizations, city districts, and shack settlements. It only accounts for one-twentieth of the city's population. It is said that due to limited funding and insufficient staff, this is the only number that could be achieved. Otherwise, the number of people vaccinated would definitely have increased significantly.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Sales of Low-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>Since the launch of low-priced rice in this city, rice prices initially maintained a stable state. However, in recent days, the market price of imported rice has increased. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau, concerned about public order, convened leaders of the rice industry to discuss measures to maintain prices. Because the low-priced rice sold by the low-price association is priced at two yuan per shi lower than the retail price in rice shops, sales have suddenly increased sharply, benefiting many common people.</p>
<h3>Rectification of Road Administration on the Jinghu Railway</h3>
<p>On the Jinghu Railway, on the 27th of last month, when the Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train was stopped at the Zhenru Station to exchange cars with the 34th freight train, because several troop cars attached to the freight train did not close their doors, the side light of the passenger train was damaged, hitting the passenger Zhou's head.

<h3>Survey of Sanlintang Street Completed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Construction Bureau of Shanghai County previously believed that most of the towns and villages in the county followed old practices and were self-governing. They were small in scale and lacked uniformity. Director Wu proposed this during the second county administration meeting and it was agreed that the measurement of various villages will first be implemented this year. Afterwards, the unified measures determined according to the conditions of each place can be followed so that future street reorganization and house reconstruction can be uniformly regulated, showing order and unification. The Fourth District, Sanlintang Town, was requested to be surveyed first this year, as it has plans to renovate streets and rebuild the city. A technician, Gong Maoxing, and an assistant, Yang Wenzhi, were specially dispatched with instruments to the countryside to conduct the actual measurement, which was completed yesterday. They are now sorting out the drafts and preparing to draw detailed maps to stipulate the standard width of the streets as a model for the various towns, so that they can be transformed next month.</p>

<h3>The Price of Gold Has Soared, Will Our Country Really Go Bankrupt?</h3>
<p>Yuan Yixiou. Recently, due to the strange shrinking of foreign exchange and the soaring price of gold, I read in the newspaper that a few people with unfounded worries made alarming arguments, saying that our country's economy will go bankrupt and that our country is finished. The general public, without thinking, also echoed, "Our country is finished, finished." The blind following of our people is truly unbearable. Thinking calmly, will the high price of gold really be the end? If all the foreign merchants who sell imported goods and the importers who specialize in selling foreign goods on behalf of foreign merchants are indeed in a precarious situation, is the complete closure of these two types of merchants a good phenomenon for our country or a bad phenomenon for our country? Please think about it calmly. It is found that various industrial and commercial countries in the world, with their ambition of economic aggression, regard our country as the interval for selling their goods. The general so-called fashionable men and women young people in our country (especially women) do not know how to cherish themselves and superstitiously trust foreign affairs. Everything must be purchased from abroad as an honor. The amount of money our country sends to foreigners every year is unknown. We have long been screaming in pain but have not been able to wake up the fellow countrymen who superstitiously trust foreign goods and have slave nature. Now, how fortunate we are to encounter a time when foreign exchange shrinks strangely, and all imported foreign goods will come without being rejected and will not come by themselves. Our fellow countrymen who superstitiously trust foreign goods are also forced to use our domestic goods. The export of domestic silk, tea, and other goods is gradually increasing, and we can also slightly regain our rights. If this situation can last for a long time, wouldn't it be a great blessing for our country? Is it necessary to buy foreign goods and send money to foreigners before we are willing to do so? Otherwise, what is the surprise and fear of the soaring price of gold and the shrinking of drafts? Those who have the means should take advantage of this rare opportunity, and the government should promptly encourage exports. Don't increase taxes on exported goods. Manufacturers across the country should quickly work hard to manufacture goods to meet the needs of the people and not raise prices to hoard goods. Textile factories should especially realize that when boycotting Japanese goods in the past, the price of cotton was very cheap. A few yarn factories in our country did not understand the righteousness and raised prices to hoard goods at that time, and they are still doing this evil practice in the exchange market to this day. Flour mills also have this evil phenomenon, only trying to make a fortune for themselves and not caring about the national economy and people's livelihood, which is greatly criticized by the world. It is hoped that there will be no such actions in the future, and it is hoped that all citizens will pay attention to supervision at all times. The things that are temporarily slightly related are kerosene, rice, wheat, flour, and cotton. However, electric lights are available in cities, and coal can be used to burn motors. If kerosene prices are too high, vegetable oil and tung oil can be used instead in the countryside. Someone will laugh at me for being ignorant of material civilization and for having a nineteenth-century old brain. I would say that it is better to be vain and be a slave to foreigners than to seek self-reliance. Gandhi's self-spinning and self-weaving are good examples for us. As for rice, wheat, cotton, etc., it is not that our country does not produce them, nor is it that there is no land to grow them. It is because in recent years everyone admires the city and dislikes the countryside, and they flock to the city and are unwilling to live in the countryside, which has led to the decline of the countryside. Those who are in the countryside are also unusually fond of gambling and lazy and do not work diligently, which has led to a year-by-year decrease in production and instead rely on foreigners for supply. For a country that is established by agriculture to come to this is not only a joke but also a heartache. This matter should be rectified as soon as possible. It does not matter whether the price of gold rises or falls, or whether foreign exchange is low. Even if the import value of rice, wheat, and cotton is low, we should not rely on foreign supply as a long-term plan and should also strive to increase production in order to achieve self-sufficiency. The method of rectification is also easy. Farmers in Wenzhou who grow land (such as Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Yixing, Liyang, and southern Anhui, etc. are all gradually becoming rich) and farmers in Sichuan who grow fields can be models for the whole country and can be hired as guides. If the government can pay attention to this, I am willing to sacrifice my time and travel expenses to go with them for on-site observation and verification, and I am willing to go and hire these two types of farmers and agricultural tools and then use the government's power to force the reform of the general lazy farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. I dare say that in less than three years, our country will not need to rely on foreigners for rice, wheat, and cotton. Yuan Yixiou, June 8th.</p>

<h3>The End of Xinyou (Peach Blossom Spring)</h3>
<p>The story of the three-act play (Peach Blossom Spring) by Saneatsu Mushanokōji is as follows:</p>
<p>In a certain era, in a certain place, there is a secluded deep mountain, full of beautiful and prosperous peach blossoms. This is all the result of more than ten years of hard work by an old man, whom people call Peach Immortal, to create this wonder of the world and a famous scenic spot for all ages. Unfortunately, he encountered an unreasonable and violent person who, disregarding the Peach Immortal's pleas, moved all the peach trees away. This tormented the Peach Immortal, and he became discouraged and did nothing. During this time, an old man with white hair and a youthful face suddenly came and painstakingly persuaded him for a long time, awakening him from his confusion and giving him a lot of courage. He started working again, and soon there was another beautiful and magnificent peach blossom mountain.</p>
<p>From this story, we can already know the difficulty of staging this play. Saneatsu Mushanokōji is only concerned with some theories and lessons, using the mouths of the Peach Immortal, the Peach Immortal's brother, and the old man to express his theories – the attitude towards life. His only function is to teach us and instruct us to work with the kind of indomitable and unwavering determination of a peach planter. Therefore, for those who often become passive and pessimistic due to minor setbacks and forget their mission, this is a good medicine. It will make you forget the fatigue of life, make you forget the misfortunes of life, make you turn back from the path of doubt, make you understand the true meaning of life, make you move forward actively, make you walk boldly on the bright journey of life, and make you feel that life is not so small, and small setbacks are not enough to dominate a great life.</p>
<p>In this era, young people with the sickness of the century are everywhere. They only know how to groan but do not know how to struggle. Unfortunately, if their careers encounter unexpected attacks, they often become discouraged and retreat, lacking the virtue of perseverance. At the same time, they also lack an old man like the one who guided the Peach Immortal. Therefore, based on the current state of our national character, the selection of this script by the Xinyou Drama Society has its own value.</p>
<p>It seems that the three plays of the Xinyou Drama Society all have a common goal of encouraging the public, a clear expression that is enough to excite our inert national character and cleanse the decadent thoughts of social inquiry. (High is even higher, good is even better, and everything is endless, even if we devote our entire lives, we cannot do it all.) The Peach Immortal said this to his brother at the beginning. If we say that the Peach Immortal has tasted the hardships of the world, it is also possible because the peach is his only spiritual sustenance. When he asked his brother about the whereabouts of the girl sought by the thugs, and he did not know, but saw the thugs destroying his beloved peaches, at that time, the impulse</p>
<p>The scene of the Peach Blossom Spring suddenly appeared. Naturally, the Peach Immortal could not avoid being frustrated and heartbroken, but what was even more unexpected was that there were unreasonable thugs who moved away the crystallization of thirty years of hard work, leaving behind a desolate mountain, touching the scenery and becoming lonely. He then fell, attributing everything to fate. How pitiful! He did not fail to understand the meaning of life, but because of this, he was even more depressed. When the old man comforted him, it was when he felt the saddest. As he listened quietly to every word of the old man, he was shedding bitter tears. Finally, he turned back, which was even more painful. The third act seemed to contain the meaning of reunion. This is probably the reward that Saneatsu Mushanokōji gave to the people. The Peach Immortal's brother was also promoted to officer through hard work, and he even married the woman who had luckily been rescued from the thugs, thus creating a disaster that made the Peach Immortal experience the cruelty of the world, and returned home in glory. (Work hard, work hard, our future.) In the end, they sang together. I think our audience should at least be moved by sympathy. If the art of drama can truly give the audience a deep impression intuitively, this is about the script. Next, I want to talk about the impression that this performance by the Xinyou Drama Society left on me. The Xinyou's (Difficult Drama Movement) has achieved the effect of pursuit to some extent. The attention and praise that the two dramas (Uncle Wen) (Dog Dancing) have attracted from the theater industry and the audience are well-deserved. Even I express my great satisfaction, and the performance of (Peach Blossom Spring) must be no less than those two dramas. However, this time it gave me some slight feelings of disappointment. Gentlemen of Xinyou, I am an audience who loves you, so I am willing to faithfully contribute my feelings of dissatisfaction to you. (The future is not dark.) Strive for it, strive for it.</p>
<p>The technical skills of stage art have not yet shown any flaws. Originally, this play is a very simple three-act, all in one place. The scenery is only the abundance of peach blossoms and the desolation after being trampled, the thatched cottage, the artificial hill – or there may be something to discuss – because such an arrangement is enough. As for the costumes, they are suitable for Chinese customs, so there is no need to prepare other props. The makeup is no less than Uncle Wen and Dog Dancing. Especially the excitement of the audience's emotions aroused by the music, combined with the expressive expressions, makes everyone can't help but be moved. I think music will occupy a very important position in stage skills in future performances. So, what am I going to say? It's hard to say. A person who does not study drama actually says this – their performance is close to being scattered. We know that to make a play that is put on the stage complete its project, it requires the average, whole, and unified development of all elements to achieve the element of acting, and the same is true on the stage. No matter which role is a ring, each one carries the same fate of life and death. The most important requirement for actors is whether the actors experience the characters in the play, and whether each actor can be as tight as iron molecules to form a chain of iron to create a chain of drama. In essence, these prior observations are the task of the director. In fact, even with a good protagonist without a good supporting role, it is still not possible to vigorously develop the plot in the play, but instead gives the audience ambiguity. In Peach Blossom Spring, we still recognize our drama loyalist, Mr. Yuan Muzhi, the Peach Immortal. His exquisite makeup and unpredictable movements, we can only recognize and distinguish his personality in his voice. The scene of him expressing suffering, decadence, and grief really makes us want to cry out with him. Unfortunately, because the supporting roles cannot be as tightly linked as iron, a state of looseness, dispersion, and diminished color is revealed, and the audience cannot be fully and powerfully held. Tang Yuanfan, the Peach Immortal's brother, is not bad, but in the third act, I think the officer's performance was not able to empathize with the situation. And since he was born in the grass, there is no need to put on the airs of an aristocrat and put the shawl on the stool in an arrogant manner when he reunites with his brother after a long separation. A certain lady, Jie Ying, is lively and eloquent, but in the first act, when she was chased and robbed by thugs and escaped to the stage, she only rolled to the ground, and there was no expression of panic. The old man, Luo Mingfeng, if compared to Shi Lisan in (Uncle Wen), I really don't believe he would perform like this. The most obvious thing is that the lines of the play are not proficient (it is really not what a great man, a great man does). This is just one example, so it is obvious that he is a little flustered, so-called busy hands and feet, or he may have simplified some of the lines. The expression naturally deteriorates. We only heard some unclear lessons, so Mr. Luo should do more work. In short, the shortcomings this time are really due to dispersion.</p>
<p>Ah, but in the end, many people have been influenced! The aggression of the rioters can be overcome with our firm working attitude, as long as we work hard. This is also the national character that our old China urgently needs to promote. Decadent and passive friends, wake up! Awaken like the Peach Immortal!</p>
<p>This is not criticism, or it can be said that some places are not right, please forgive me.</p>
<h3>Jiaoda Organizes Surveying Team</h3>
<p>Surveying is the most important subject for those studying civil engineering, and it is also the basic work for their future assignments. Surveying is not theory, so understanding must be practical practice to understand its mysteries. The School of Civil Engineering of Jiaoda, in view of this, specially organized a surveying team during this summer vacation to go to Hankou and other places for practical surveying. The leader of the team is Mr. Li Qianruo, the dean of the School of Civil Engineering of the school, and professors Tan Fosheng and Wei Simeng also accompany the team for guidance. There are more than 100 team members, composed of second- and third-year students from the school. They are divided into 16 groups, each group of 7 to 8 people. Each group has a group leader and an assistant, who are elected by each group for management purposes. The surveying plan is scheduled to be completed in six weeks. The first three weeks are for surveying flat land, and the last three weeks are for surveying railways and plateaus and lowlands. The land surveyed by each group is different, and is designated by the dean and professors. The surveying results are compiled into a report and submitted to the dean and professors for approval and scoring, which is used as part of the academic record. It is heard that the Ministry of Railways also plans to order the students of the school to go to survey the unfinished section of the Yuehan Railway in order to build it on schedule, but due to the current situation, it is expected that it may not be possible to implement.</p>

<p>June 19th, Republic of China. All travel expenses for this trip will be free of charge by all routes according to the order of the Ministry of Railways. It is also heard that the ferry has been negotiated properly. The school will also subsidize accommodation and food expenses to reduce the burden on students, so the students of the school are all delighted and praise the school authorities for not giving up, etc. (Hua Hua)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways sends staff to Jiaoda to supervise the exam</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways will hold the graduation examination for the fourth-year graduates of the Railway Management Institute, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and the preparatory graduates of Jiaotong University this year next week. The undergraduate graduates must go to the Ministry of Railways to take office, and the preparatory students will also be promoted to undergraduate students for study. Therefore, this graduation examination is extremely important. In order to implement the examination of the full number of meetings, the strict resolution and the selection of true talents to prevent fraud, a special staff member was specially sent to Shanghai to supervise the examination. The appointed personnel are Mr. Jin Yaoshang, the section chief of the Ministry of Railways, Mr. Wang Jinzhi, the director of the Engineering Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, and Mr. Zhuo Zhenxiong, the section chief of the Material Purchase Committee. The three gentlemen will all come to the school to supervise the examination before the examination. It is heard that this graduation examination will last for two weeks. After the examination, the staff will compile the results of the supervision into a report and return to the ministry to report on their lives, etc. (Hua Hua)</p>

<p>Tuesday (7) Book Review</p>
<h3>Low Whisper Zanhua</h3>
<p>A collection of poems by Ms. Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen several collections of poems by women in the lonely poetry world, which has attracted our attention.</p>
<p>In the past, it was not that there were no collections of poems by women, but from what I have seen, they were either high-minded philosophical mysteries that were unimaginable, or they were things that used spring flowers and autumn moons as entertainment. Of course, there were also many who wrote about the sadness and inner distress, but this kind of sadness and distress was not necessarily deep and moving, but mostly a kind of adolescent sentimentality.</p>
<p>When the book (Low Whisper) is opened, the author uses her old work (A belly full of bitterness is turned into a light smile in front of others) to replace the preface. This is naturally known at a glance that it is a sad work, but in my opinion, this kind of sadness is not something that ordinary women sitting in the boudoir can feel, but an internal coercion of venting that has swept through the social demons.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts, before and after, containing twenty-six poems. Except for the two poems (Expedition) (Funeral Oration), which are relatively heroic and unrestrained, the others are almost consistently filled with depression and sadness. From this, we can see the author's view of life and what she has felt in society. At the same time, we can also see what the attitude of the women who were once involved in the high tide of the revolution is after their failure.</p>
<p>The author's life is very bleak, and her verses are full of mottled bloodstains. We see that her initial feeling of human troubles is written as (I was originally a small forget-sorrow grass, and I was brought to the dressing table. I only know that there are troubles in the world) (Page 76). This is obviously a girl full of fantasy and the troubles she feels after contacting reality. Then she bravely walks into society, starting her drift like catkins to the horizon, and as a result, she feels (Unfortunately, I was condemned to the world to suffer drifting. Twenty years are like a dream, and I only end up with a bloody heart) (Page 65) and the painful shout of (These years I have suffered pain and wandering, suffering all the hardships) (Page 2). Secondly, she walked all over the world with enthusiasm, like a lost lamb who could not find a home. She shouted Secondly, she walked all over the world with enthusiasm, like a lost lamb who could not find a home, so she deeply felt the sadness of loneliness, such as (I sit alone by the cold window, only the lonely lamp accompanies me) (Page 15) and (I am like a wild goose wandering on the horizon, melancholy) (Page 16) express this emotion to the fullest. Again, it is (For the pursuit of the elusive phantom, my youth has disappeared year after year) (Page 3) and cannot help but regret the loss of youth. In the poem (Destroying Makeup), it is even more obvious (For the passing youth, I regret and regret) (Page</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>June 10th, Republic of China (Shenbao This Twenty-Fifth Page) In the end, based on the above reasons, the facts forced her to find a way out, so in that environment, she (prepared to throw this small body into the battle line) (Page 47) and dedicated herself to the torrent of revolution. During this period, she obviously had a period of revitalization. Seeing her shouting in (Expedition) (Revolutionary comrades ride on war horses and go to the battlefield together) (Page 81) and that extremely tragic (Funeral Oration), we know that if it were not for a woman who had gone through the high tide of the revolution, it would be impossible to write it based on imagination alone. However, this period was very short and became a past illusion, giving her another fierce blow. She could no longer muster the courage to fight, so she became sad and painful beyond recovery. Seeing her (From now on, I will indulge in the poisonous cup and indulge in wandering and desolation) (Page 11), I even thought of using a green lamp and ancient Buddha as a relief, such as (Where is there a deep mountain and ancient temple? I am willing to be free from the world. There should be a place for me to stay temporarily by the side of the green lamp and ancient Buddha) (Page 54), and even disillusioned to (There is no hope in this life, I only wish to sleep in the quiet realm of no one), simply wanting to use death to relieve the pain of reality.</p>
<p>The above can probably be said to be the author's experience and the transformation of her thoughts. From this, we can see a historical background, and the author is also the product of this era and environment.</p>
<p>Originally, the women of the intellectual class in China in the past ten years have also undergone several changes in their thinking. During the (May Fourth) Movement, the ideological trends of the Western women's movement came crashing down, especially the thoughts of Tolstoy and Ibsen. At that time, women were influenced by them and felt their own shortcomings, economic inability to be independent, and the lack of freedom in marriage. As a result, the phenomenon of distress and sadness almost swept the world. This consciousness was reflected in reality, so the actions of running away like Nora and passively embracing celibacy and the delusion of taking participation in politics as an outlet also emerged one after another. But this is biased towards one corner, and has not yet gained a clear understanding of society. The occurrence of the National Revolution changed the thinking of women again. Objective facts determined their fate, and they also actually took revolutionary action as an outlet. When the National Revolutionary Army progressed to the Yangtze River Basin, this movement gradually expanded, and it was further considered an honor to ride horses and kill enemies and place themselves on the front line. This heroic and vigorous spirit not only washed away the habits of weakness in the boudoir of China for thousands of years, but also created an indelible history of glory and happiness. However, this action disappeared like a flash in the pan due to the change of objective facts. As a result, most of the women who retreated from the revolutionary front entered the road of disillusionment in the same way as the author.</p>
<p>Although we feel that it is wrong and wrong for women to embark on this path of disillusionment, it is also an inevitable phenomenon that most women cannot withstand such a major era of differentiation. To eliminate this phenomenon, the problem is very big and cannot be said in a few words. I will talk about it when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>Looking at the form of the poems, most of the poems in this collection are square and neat, as if they were cut with a knife. Originally, this kind of poem was influenced by Western travel poems. Xu Zhimo and Zhu Xiang were the first to start it in China, but at that time it was not so neat. But when it came to Yu Gengyu, it became more and more intensified. In this kind of poem, his sentences are almost neatly arranged in each line, and even one word is not uneven. Although there are four lines, six lines, and eight lines, the rhymes must be coordinated, and he strives to ponder and decorate to dazzle people. The author of this book has been greatly influenced by him.</p>
<p>Although we cannot say that poems do not need to be decorated, they must be decorated naturally, carved naturally, without leaving traces of chisels, and not hindering the content of the poems, and can beautify the content of the poems even more and express them without being bound. This can be considered good at decoration. To give an analogy, the decoration of a poem is just like a person's decoration. Rouge powder can certainly increase beauty, but if it is applied inappropriately and all over the head and face, it will be as red as Guan Yu on the stage, and as white as Bai Wuchang in the City God Temple. Wouldn't it make the viewers sweat when they walk in front of people? How can we talk about beauty? Therefore, Yuan Haowen actually regarded him as (poetry prisoners) for his pondering like Jia Dao and Meng Jiao, but they were prisoners in the cage of form and were captured. How can we talk about making poems?</p>
<p>Here, we feel that these square and neat poems have not been able to get out of the prison of form, and it can simply be said that there is content for the sake of form, and not form for the sake of content. Therefore, some of these works inevitably have the problems of affectation, piling up, and decoration. Often, some sentences that are very natural are forced to be mixed with a few words in order to take care of the fact that they are the same length as other sentences. As a result, a person who was originally very beautiful has been messed up by their rouge and powder, making them neither human nor ghost. In the author's first collection, the author suffered from many such problems.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is what we often see in this kind of poem, it is often easy to insert many sentences that are derived from poems, lyrics, and songs. Are the sentences (Life and death are different and vague) (Page 15) and (White horse purple gold saddle) (Page 80) in this book not similar to the old poems of five or seven characters? In addition, like the lyrics (Don't mention the past, how can the past be mentioned again) (Page 69), like the songs (Let the sea dry up and the stones rot, I will remember your kindness) (Page 68) and (After singing Yangguan, you look at my dust rising, from then on we will miss each other in the wind and rain evening) (Page 69), there are even like Beijing tunes such as (Most lamentable) (Thinking of the past) (Page 53). Isn't this a big plate of mixed vegetables?</p>
<p>One thing that is not satisfactory is that the author likes to use words like (treasure knife) (qingcong) (jade face) a red candle) to decorate his poems.</p>
<p>Finally, looking at the whole book, I relatively like (Expedition) and (Funeral Oration) because they leave a page worth cherishing and reminiscing for women's history.</p>
<p>The night is cool as water, and the light breeze sends the singing of (Nuya Nu) (Drizzle), which makes me even more unable to stop thinking about those women who once fought bloody battles on the battlefield.</p>
