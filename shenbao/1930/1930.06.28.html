<h3>玻璃維亞之革命</h3>
<p>當此民族運動勃發之時期中拉丁亞美利加民族運動之聲　寂已久而近亦漸漸發現矣數月前多明哥共和國發生革命風潮一次今玻璃維亞共和國又突起革命風潮皆含有民族運動之意味者也</p>
<p>蓋所謂拉丁亞美利加民族勢力本甚强大自美西一戰而後中南美紛起獨立改建共和者多至二十國然名爲共和而實則有一共通之弊病政權多操於軍人手中因軍人爭奪政權常引起革命政變經濟權多操於外人手中因國民爭奪經濟權常引起國際問糾粉故此許多共和國實際上已變成政治的或經濟的半殖民地矣</p>
<p>即以多明哥之革命論表面雖爲反對總統任期之延長實則反對總统以關税向美抵債與政府理財無策經濟界日漸凋疲也玻璃維亞之政局較多明哥更不安定國内之鐵道關税政府銀行準備金及一切賦税收入多數作爲外債担保品受美國銀行家支配數年前即已如此而其政權亦常操於軍人手中故此次之推翻政府風潮即爲反對政府軍司令肯特將軍而起今其事態日見嚴重此僅據英美電訊所發表者而言内容不能詳悉惟究其原因總不外政治與經濟交相壓迫武力與外力重疊侵陵使國内人民不得不起而反抗也中南美之各獨立國具此種情勢者正多多玻兩國殆首爲潮流所感盪而先發者歟</p>

<p>滬南河下連日無到南路西路各産區均視閘方之變化爲依舊故來源停頓刻下交易悉爲洋米故公會西貢小絞等交易大暢價格飛升目前帕品到華之機會甚佳耳</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<p>素箋湯增敭</p>
<p>[P陸晶清女士著</p>
<p>書簡體裁的故事在中國貧弱的文藝園中是别開了一條生面有如一個勤勞的園丁栽培一株易於滋長的花木祗要能夠努力地灌漑一下最後底良好的收穫是不難得到的因爲書信是任何人都會寫的内容祇求明白淺顯不必像製作一篇故事的那樣曲折離奇過於誇張的描寫以及用字的精鍊等等應具的條件否則便成爲一篇[平凡的故事]了倘若書簡應用到文藝的作品上來公開地要求讀者去鑑賞那末又非有藝術的手腕而不能寫出一篇所謂感動人的成功作品仍是舊有的一種普通的通信而已所以一般新進努力製作的人所寫的故事大都採用這種書簡式的比較容易獲得優良的收效實際事實並不如此無論那種文藝作品的成功根本不是這樣的簡單有時以書簡體裁來創作的常遭慘敗也就是爲了這個原因概括的説一句不論什麽文藝作品總要由自已特闢條新路模仿和因襲都不是創造文藝應有的態度更不會逹到成功的地步陸晶清女士最近剛出版的這部[素箋]雖然她所寫的是採取書簡式的但是她已向新的方面進展决不是可以與一般平凡而簡陋的書信體的文藝作品相比較顯然的在中國貧弱的文藝園圃中是别開了一條生面</p>
<p>這集[素箋]據作者自已説是致幾個似曾相識者的信在我全部的將它讀完之後也感覺得是如此雖然這裏面所包括的十篇[素箋]無須説是採用書簡式的但是她所表現的却是新頴可嘉即所謂採取舊的形式加上了新的内容實實屬不易多得的作品</p>
<p>據我所知道的作者品清是一位帶有濃厚感傷性的女詩人先前在春潮書店出版了一本詩集[詆訴]在本刋已有贊華君介紹過她的詩我也讀過我覺得她這本[素箋]比較她的詩還成功些素箋眞是具有明白樸質美的素箋每篇都是憑了她一枝清韻而細膩的筆寫下來的讀起來有時竟能使我們輕快地如登在另一世界這實是因爲她底作品充滿了詩意的美詩人的靈感特别豐富手腕分外的高超無論一篇什麽作品如果是經過詩人的手筆而描寫下來的無疑地能夠將作者自已的感情傳入於讀者被美的詩意所感動的所以她這本短短的十篇[素箋]與其名它是短篇故事無寗説</p>
<p>它是美的散文誠然早十篇美的散文</p>
<p>她驕傲的性格永久保持着一直到她寫完了末一封信的時候還是這樣堅守着不稍轉移她底意志這很能引起讀者的敬仰心其尤可以做一般素性猶疑不定的女子底範榜在她每一篇裏所寫的記實又更能逗引起我們無上的旨趣她並非像現代那些浪漫的女子故意的捉弄男性實在因爲她個性驕矜决不甘願屈服於險惡男子的膝下作一個被玩弄的犧牲者而且絶端的不信任男子最有趣的就是她對於這一來位似曾相識者的男性始終未覆過他們一信而且彼此從不互相道知姓名在她遇見的男子有的是在姑母家近湖的小園内有的是在同乘長江船的時候有的是在避署於西山的那游泳池畔有的是在公共體育塲伯網球場上有的是在她落水而被救的那時有的是在遭父喪而南返的途中有的是在粉墨登塲的演劇之後有的是在美麗秋夜的小亭地邊有的是爲了他贈送了她一葉緋色的楓葉有的是爲了同來參加伯君的喜筵所以這裏面每個短箋都是獨立的存在假使把它連綴起一口氣讀完也覺得有一貫性趣味盎然的　　在前面已經説過她是一位帶着濃厚感傷色彩的女詩人所以在她的素箋裏仍然脱不掉她所披着的悲哀之幔不過比在她詩裏感傷色彩已减輕了许多雖然有時還想向積極的旅途上跑去應該重新[打點做人]的但勉强掙扎總不能逹到光明的彼岸</p>
<p>我首次流浪到百花洲畔正是初由絶　　境中掙扎起來忍着痛創要想創造　　新生重新扶持起自已所以那時候　　我一方面是努力於忘記不堪回首的</p>
<p>舊夢而另一方面努力的從事我新　　的事業期望很快的就能把自已從　　愁苦與潦倒中超脱出來再好好的　　做一個人</p>
<p>看她第七箋裏這樣的一段可以知道她最大的希望是[好好的做一個人]但是最後的結果依然脱不掉企冀着踏上所謂消極的死的路程</p>
<p>我被這心底的隱秘擺弄得有如毒蛇　　纒繞着一樣的痛楚我需要一個痛</p>
<p>快的毒醉毒醉到長眠永不醒</p>
<p>天知道我是剛負了重傷從血泊中　　掙扎起來登上這新的一條旅程我　　要捧着顆痛創的心在人世混完全是　　爲我不甘於被命運屈伏所以我忍　　着痛楚燃起自已生命的火炬奔上大　　道爲的是要做些比較有意義的事　　求一個痛快的死</p>
<p>在悲慘的生命之流中過活的青年男女們每於精神極度頽廢的時候老是希求衝上了[死]的征程好似[死]便是人生最後的而且最美滿的歸宿要曉得事實决不是如此[死的勝利]終久是屬於消極這一方面的在現今的大時代中尤其是對於文藝有異樣旨趣的青年男女們應該把握着[民族的中心思想]向積極的征途上跑去作有意識的奮鬥謳歌個人的悲哀在現時代實不容許的人</p>
<p>是誰都知道中華民族經了幾千年的壓迫還未曾獲得眞正的自由尤其是對於文藝有異樣旨趣的青年男女們是應該毫不遲疑的覺醒起來努力向上的去爲民族而奮鬥傷感的幔早就須將它撕掉不要再加顧惜了</p>
<p>本書最大的缺點是給予我們多量的消極的印象不是促進我們向積極的方面的努力的</p>
<p>不過這書裏面有幾處所寫的足以代表中華女子的特性但是大多數都在弱點上着力這是很可惜的如果她是能夠將中華女子民族性的最長處用富於藝術手腕的赤裸裸地把它描寫下來這薄薄的一本[素箋]無疑地可以成爲一本偉大的而有意義的書作者所有的悲哀成分已較她底詩裹所表現的减少了許多在未來這傷感的色彩或許能夠全部克服也未可知我們也企冀作者能夠將傷感的色彩全部的克服</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Revolution in Bolivia</h3>
<p>Amidst this period of burgeoning national movements, the voice of Latin American national movements, silent for a long time, has recently begun to gradually emerge. A few months ago, a revolutionary wave occurred in the Dominican Republic, and now a revolutionary wave has suddenly erupted in the Republic of Bolivia, both containing the implication of national movements.</p>
<p>The so-called Latin American national power was originally very strong. After the Spanish-American War, many countries in Central and South America rose up in independence and reorganized into republics, numbering as many as twenty. However, although nominally republics, they share a common problem: political power is mostly controlled by military men, and military men often cause revolutions and coups in their scramble for power. Economic power is mostly controlled by foreigners, and nationals often cause international disputes in their struggle for economic power. Therefore, many of these republics have actually become political or economic semi-colonies.</p>
<p>Taking the Dominican Republic's revolution as an example, on the surface it was against the extension of the president's term, but in reality, it was against the president using tariffs to offset debts to the United States, and the government's mismanagement of finances, leading to a gradual decline in the economic sector. The political situation in Bolivia is even more unstable than in the Dominican Republic. The country's railways, customs duties, government bank reserves, and all tax revenues are mostly used as collateral for foreign debts and are controlled by American bankers. This has been the case for several years, and its political power is also often controlled by military men. Therefore, this wave of overthrowing the government was launched against General Kennett, the commander of the government's army. Now the situation is becoming increasingly serious. This is only according to what has been published by British and American telegrams; the details are not known. However, the fundamental reason is nothing more than the mutual oppression of politics and economics, and the overlapping invasion of military and foreign forces, forcing the people of the country to rise up in resistance. Many of the independent countries of Central and South America have this kind of situation. Are Bolivia and the Dominican Republic perhaps the first to be affected by the trend and take the lead?</p>

<p>International Important News</p>
<p>Bolivian Revolution</p>
<p>The current government has been overthrown.</p>
<p>The president has fled the country for refuge.</p>
<p>Reuters, La Paz, Bolivia, 26th: The army has overthrown the current government. President Dr. Siles has left the country. Note that his presidential term expires on August 6th of this year. Associated Press, Peru, 26th: According to today's news, the Bolivian revolutionaries have overthrown the provisional government and established a military government. Most of La Paz has been occupied by the revolutionary army, and street fighting is currently underway, with many casualties. It is rumored that the majority of the Bolivian army has sided with the revolutionary army, but this has not yet been verified.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th: It is reported that the Bolivian revolution is accompanied by terrifying scenes. The army, angered by the police's slaughter of civilians, rose up to expel them. Many people were killed and wounded during the battle.

<p>Iceland Holds</p>
<p>Millennium Celebration of Parliament</p>
<p>More Than 30,000 Guests From Various Countries</p>
<p>The Danish King and Queen Personally Attended</p>
<p>National News Agency, Reykjavik, 26th: The millennium celebration of the Icelandic Parliament was held at noon today on the historically famous Thingvellir plain. This is where the Norse people, 1,000 years ago, declared independence from the Viking royal family and formed the world's oldest parliament on the third Thursday in June. More than 30,000 guests from various countries around the world attended, with the most coming from Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The Danish King and Queen personally attended, and the crown princes of Sweden and Norway and other royal families also attended the grand ceremony. Various European countries sent warships to the island to participate in the gun salute. The most important event of this memorial ceremony, which will last a week, will be the announcement that Iceland intends to join the League of Nations immediately. It is reported that the Danish King, to whom the island nominally belongs, has already agreed to this.</p>
<p>Soviet Communist Party Congress</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded</p>
<p>Intense Internal Strife</p>

<p>Verbal Battle in the French Parliament</p>
<p>Government Diverting State Funds to Secret Military Preparations</p>
<p>The Socialist Party's Motion of Opposition Was Ultimately Defeated</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 26th: The Socialist Party's motion in the French Parliament demanding that the government report in detail to the parliamentary budget committee on the accounts of the diversion of state funds was defeated today after an unusually fierce debate by a vote of 330 to 262. Socialist Party member Auriol was the first to speak, saying that the government had diverted hundreds of thousands of francs to secret military preparations, shocking the whole country, and that it would continue to spend on this in the future, inevitably leading to the exhaustion of the treasury and the impoverishment of the country. He solemnly declared that there were already 600 million francs outside the military expenditure budget passed by the parliament, and asked why Prime Minister Naihe still wanted to hide it. Prime Minister Taidiou seemed quite uneasy when he heard this, but his reply also took an offensive stance, strongly criticizing the party for attacking the government on this matter, causing unpleasant repercussions in other countries. He also said that the parliamentary budget committee would be able to understand deeply that, with the recent advances in science, special expenditures had to be made to replace old-fashioned combat materials and to modernize the army. At this point, Tai used security as a verbal weapon, winning the applause of the right wing. However, throughout the speech, he avoided the real issues and only assured the parliament that there were still 500 million economic development fees in the state treasury. Finally, he said that the government would treat the defeat of the Socialist Party's motion as a matter of confidence. As a result, the motion was defeated.</p>
<p>Another Bloody Tragedy in the Ayeyarwady Region of India</p>

The police had no choice but to open fire on the crowd, killing one and wounding thirteen. Reuters, Calcutta, 26th: Four women were sentenced to six months in prison for violating police orders and participating in the demonstration parade for the anniversary of the death of Das, the former leader of the Bengal National Party. In addition, two male secretaries of the National Party were also sentenced to six months in prison for this.</p>
<p>Germany Opposes</p>
<p>British Rule Over East Fiji</p>
<p>Will Make Every Effort to Hinder Its Realization</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 26th: German Foreign Minister Dr. Curtius said in parliament today regarding the British Colonial Conference's plan to merge former German East Fiji with British Fiji that Germany could demand to participate in colonial undertakings based on the success of its former colonial policies. If the UK merges the former German East Fiji, which is held in trust, with the adjacent British territory, then this move is contrary to the independence of the trusteeship. This proposal by the British government must first be reviewed by the League of Nations before it can be implemented. The Germans will make every effort to hinder the realization of this proposal, he said.</p>
<p>Italy Follows Suit</p>
<p>Opposes New US Tariffs</p>
<p>Increased National Defense Expenditure Is Necessary</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance Declared in the Senate</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 26th: Italian Finance Minister Mosconi stated in the Senate when explaining the budget proposal that although the country's finances are currently balanced, Italy cannot ignore the threat of increased military preparations by certain countries, and that the people may soon have to increase their burden to provide for the minimum necessary national defense expenditure. He also said that recently certain countries have increased tariffs, and Italy will also take retaliatory measures. Although Mosconi's words referred to several countries, they were actually aimed at the United States. Japan's Propaganda to the United States</p>
<p>Claiming No Aggressive Ambitions?</p>
<p>Associated Press, Chicago, 26th: Duke Tokugawa, President of the Tokyo Rotary Club, said at the Rotary Conference here today that Japan's highest aspiration is to foster peace. Currently, Japan will focus all its efforts on consolidating its domestic economic and financial situation. Japan has no intention of invading other countries with its national policies, and there is even less talk of ambitions for territorial aggression.</p>
<p>Anxiety in the Japanese Economic World</p>
<p>The Government Seeks Relief Measures</p>
<p>Plans to Start with Reorganizing Industries</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 27th: The uneasiness and agitation in Japan's financial and economic circles due to the sharp increase in unemployment, the plummeting market prices of raw silk and cotton yarn, and the panic and disastrous decline in the stock market are becoming increasingly serious. If this continues, it is not known whether something ominous will happen. The party and the government are gradually advocating changing policies. Even the government cannot ignore it. Finance Minister Inoue and Commerce Minister Taware have stipulated the following schedule for frankly exchanging opinions with various parties as a reference for changing policies: On the 27th, a meeting with insurance companies will be held at the Finance Minister's official residence in Nagatacho. On the 28th, a meeting with bankers will be held at the Bank of Japan. On July 3rd, a symposium with shipping companies will be held at the Prime Minister's official residence. The government's policy at the above meetings is to hope that banks will ensure the smooth flow of funds for industrial rationalization, and that the recovery of loans will not be hindered. The government itself hopes that insurance companies and trust companies will not help to lower market prices when buying and selling securities, and that loans to business companies will be recovered slowly and that new loans will be given more attention. However, it is questionable whether the various industries will be willing to comply with the government's demands. If the government is willing to consider the policy changes hoped for by the private sector, such as easing tight policies, then these meetings may be able to exchange mutually beneficial benefits.</p>
<p>Minister Wu Broadcasts</p>
<p>Speech to Students Across America</p>
<p>Washington Correspondence The Columbia Broadcasting Company launched an airborne school to invite celebrities to give speeches to 20,000 schools across the United States. On May 15th, in order to promote international friendship, a broadcast was held in the reception room of the US State Department's diplomatic corps. The speakers included US Secretary of State Stimson, Secretary of the Interior Welner, and our country's ambassador to the United States, Wu Chaoshu. Before Minister Wu's speech, the company specially played a piece of Chinese national music to show respect for China. The following is the transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>American boys and girls, although I cannot meet you in person, I am very happy to have the opportunity to talk to you today, because many years ago I also studied at American schools. From your point of view, China seems to be a distant country and has little to do with you. You probably only think of China when you drink tea as a tea-producing country, when you wear silk clothes as China being the first to supply silk to the world, and when you set off firecrackers on July 4th as the Chinese being the inventors of gunpowder. Please allow me to list a few interesting facts and make a comparison with your country. In your geography books, China seems to be slightly smaller in area, probably because China only occupies one part of the map of Asia, while the United States seems to be larger because it occupies at least one full page in the map. If I tell you that China's area is even larger than the combined area of the 48 states of the United States plus Mexico and Central America, you may be surprised. Both China and the United States are extremely rich in natural resources. China has a large population, with one in four people in the world being Chinese. The Chinese have a long and brilliant history. When you read the history of Rome and Greece, you feel that they are very ancient, but you do not know that Chinese history is even more ancient, similar to ancient Egypt, Babylon, and Assyria. Although the United States is one of the youngest countries in the world, it is one of the oldest republics, while China is one of the youngest republics in the world. China became a republic only 19 years ago, which was China's most drastic change. At the same time, other changes are still underway, which shows that the Chinese people are becoming the newest people from the most ancient nation. However, it takes time for the Chinese people to adapt to this change. Therefore, you often hear news of unrest in China. In American history, after the War of Independence, the United States went through a long period of transformation until the Civil War ended. France also had the same experience between the First Republic and the Third Republic. China's quest to adapt to the environment will not take long, because today's world is changing much faster than it was a hundred years ago. China sends many male and female students to study in the United States, more than to other Western countries. Today, there are about 2,000 Chinese students in the United States. The United States also has students in China studying Chinese culture, art, and history, but their number is not as large as the number of Chinese students in the United States. Our students in the United States inform Americans of the customs of our country, and after they return to China, they will inform the Chinese people of the customs of the United States. They are actually unofficial ambassadors, a medium for emotional communication between the two countries. The friendship between China and the United States is excellent. Although Americans sometimes find the actions of the Chinese peculiar, the Chinese also find the actions of Americans peculiar. Once, an American child asked a Chinese child why things were upside down. The Chinese child asked the American child why things were upside down. This shows that things in the world are often not a matter of right or wrong, but just a different point of view. However, the mutual feelings of the Chinese and American people are still very harmonious. The reason may be the similarity of the fundamental concepts of the two peoples, or the similarity of their humorous psychology. In any case, the Chinese and American people have been very friendly in the past, are currently friendly, and will continue to be so in the future.</p>
<p>Labor Conference</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 26th: The Labor Conference today passed the draft act on seven and three-quarter hours of work per day in coal mines by a vote of 75 to 33.</p>
<p>British House of Commons</p>
<p>Debates the Issue of Prostitution in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, London, 26th: When the House of Commons debated colonial issues today, Labor MP Mrs. Dobville asked the colonial conference whether it could consider the issue of female slaves being prostitutes in Hong Kong. The Undersecretary of the Colonial Office replied that the new chapter on slavery had only been implemented last December and had not been in place for long, so it could not be said to have failed. This matter was inherently very difficult, especially since Hong Kong was virtually a Chinese city. However, active efforts are being made to strictly enforce the new chapter. Although there may be some danger in reducing the enslaved women to the status of servants, the benefits of abolishing slavery ultimately outweigh the dangers. He is convinced that the Chinese authorities have faithfully and diligently sought to prevent female slaves from entering Hong Kong, but the unrest in China has meant that the results have been meager. The Hong Kong government has a policy of abolishing prostitution. The new Governor of Hong Kong has discussed this matter with the Home Secretary.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province Reforms Farmland Tax Measures</h3>
<p>Distributing Expenditures of Each County as a Whole</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department believes that the methods of collecting farmland tax in various counties are chaotic, mixed, and cannot be investigated. There are many long-standing malpractices and hidden secrets in the grain storage. In addition, the tax amount varies from county to county, and the additional taxes levied by each county are five, six, or even ten times more than the principal tax. The people's burden is uneven, and there are complaints. The situation will inevitably change. It is imperative to thoroughly reform the farmland tax collection method. In addition, it is found that the income of poor counties is insufficient to cover the county's administrative expenses, with annual losses ranging from 12,000 to 56,000 yuan. Administrative, judicial, and prison expenses must be paid monthly, and various special funds are often挪用 and borrowed to meet emergency needs, causing countless disputes. If this continues, the county's finances will inevitably go bankrupt in three years. If there is no overall plan, the personnel responsible for handling affairs will be at a loss. This is not a good phenomenon for the province's politics and must be thoroughly reformed from the root. It is planned to start with a survey and statistical table.</p>
<p>One is to investigate farmland tax statistics. It is planned to re-determine the farmland tax regulations in various counties and uniformly change them to three classes and nine grades in accordance with the original case of the land survey in Wujiang County. All previous names of old tax regulations will be abolished and distributed separately according to the three classes and nine grades in order to be concise and unified and to prevent the accumulation of malpractices in the grain storage. After the tax regulations are stipulated, the names of Mang Yin and Cao Rice will be abolished and uniformly changed to ocean yards. The amount of silver and rice tax will be combined and determined. Each mu of land should be taxed at a certain rate of ocean yuan. According to this single whip method, the people can see clearly at a glance, and the grain storage staff cannot manipulate it, which benefits both the people and the treasury. This is the general situation of the reform of farmland tax collection.</p>
<p>One is to investigate county financial statistics. It is planned to re-distribute the number of positive and supplementary income of each county and the number of administrative expenses of each county as a whole. According to the total income of various additional taxes, a percentage will be drawn up to determine how many percent of the education fee should be obtained, how many percent of the construction fee should be obtained, and how many percent of the county administrative fee should be obtained. The original plan for special funds that were levied without statistics will be re-submitted for revision and distributed as a whole to ensure that each county is fair and that the administrative expenses of each county are settled. With this reform, all disputes can be resolved and the county budget can be established. This is the general situation of solving county finances.</p>
<p>In addition to issuing a notice to various counties to check and fill in various forms and submit them for overall planning, the Finance Department has also submitted the handling situation to the Provincial Government for record. The Provincial Government meeting yesterday has resolved to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Financial Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The soaring gold prices have shaken the society's economy. Businesses have suffered enormous losses, and the market is showing signs of instability. The Liaoning Provincial authorities, in an effort to maintain stability, have held several important meetings to discuss remedies. The following measures have been decided:</p>
<p>(1) Eliminating Miscellaneous Taxes in Various Counties: Chairman Zang Shiyi believes that, given the current financial crisis and commercial depression, various items listed under the local taxes originally levied in the counties during the 18th year of the Republic should be exempted starting from the 19th year to ease the burden on merchants and residents. He has specifically instructed the Department of Finance to carefully examine and eliminate burdensome details when compiling the budget for local taxes collected in the counties for the 19th year.</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Department of Finance found that among the local taxes originally levied in 20 counties, including Xi'an, there were 32 types, such as kiln taxes, which were either close to being burdensome or of limited value. It has instructed Xi'an and other counties to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants and exempt them all.</p>
<p>(2) Providing Loans to Assist Farmers and Merchants: The provincial authorities have repeatedly received requests from commercial and agricultural associations inside and outside the province to allocate funds for loans to provide assistance. Measures have now been agreed upon, instructing the counties to comply with the following: 1. The government will allocate 2 million yuan, and the official bank will prepare 3 million yuan to be lent to various businesses with guarantees from local chambers of commerce, with a limit of 500 yuan per business. 2. If there is a surplus in the official public funds of various regions that is not urgently needed, it can also be used to provide loans to merchants and residents, limited to 300 yuan per household, to be repaid within a specified period. 3. Public properties, public reserves, and grain reserves for famine relief in the villages of various regions can also be lent to farmers to assist with farming, to be repaid after the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>(3) Convening a Provincial Business Conference: The soaring gold prices and plummeting silver prices have caused huge losses to all industries across the country. The Eastern Provinces are in a special situation, deeply affected by foreign capital's invasion and oppression, and commerce is particularly weak. Recently, more than nine bankruptcies have been discovered in various businesses in Shenyang. The Farmers and Workers' General Association has held several joint meetings to discuss currency maintenance and business relief measures. In order to fundamentally address the situation, a provincial business conference is planned to be convened. Chambers of commerce in various counties have been notified to hold the meeting on July 1st.</p>
<p>(4) Reducing Railway Freight Rates: The Northeast Communications Committee has decided to reduce the freight rates for various imported and exported goods on all railways by 50%, and the transit tax by 70%. The Shenhai, Jihai, Beining, and Qike railways have all implemented this. Currently, the South Manchuria Railway is experiencing a decline in freight transport due to the low silver prices (train fares are collected in gold certificates). In order to compete and boost business, our side has instructed the Transportation Department to order all stations to reduce freight rates by 30% for first, second, third, and fourth-class goods sent from Qinhuangdao, Yingkou, Tianzhuangtai, and Shenyang to Tongliao, except for coal and oil, which have special prices.

<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>Extortion Case Solved, Main Culprit Arrested: Ma Rusong, a farmer from Baijia Village outside the East Gate, was previously extorted by gangsters Yao Guangshan and Sheng Zhongwen, who demanded 2,000 yuan in person. Ma reported the incident to the local Public Security Substation and the Chamber of Commerce Headquarters. The two gangsters, Yao and Sheng, were apprehended on the spot and sent to the county government for punishment. According to their confession, they were entrusted by Cai Xiuwen, who is at large, to extort money from Ma. On the 26th, Shen Guilin of the county government's political police arrested Cai. After being interrogated and having his handwriting verified by interrogator Chen, Cai was immediately detained and will be punished according to the law after further investigation.</p>
<p>Two Kidnappings in One Night: On the evening of the 25th, at about 10 p.m., more than 20 gangsters armed with guns arrived at Shaoxiang Village, Zhangpu Township, in the county. They robbed farmer Chen Sanhe's house, stealing clothes and hundreds of silver dollars. Before leaving, they kidnapped Chen, his sons Apei and Ayu, and his nephew Agen, taking them onto a boat and sailing away. On the same night, Zhou Jingchen, a farmer from Chunli, and his grandson Ada were also kidnapped by the same gang of gangsters, who stole over 100 yuan. Chen Sanhe was released by the gangsters around midnight and reported the incident to the local district office and public security bureau on the 26th, requesting them to report it to the county government for strict investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Summary of Resolutions from County Party Consolidation Meeting: The County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee held its 31st meeting on the 27th to discuss the following matters: (1) It was resolved to create a financial income and expenditure form for the district party departments, to be distributed to each district for periodic filling and reporting. (2) Wang Shen Huizhen from Chenjiahang Township filed a complaint against her nephew Jin Yu for assault. The county government determined that the assault did not warrant prosecution and should not be assisted. It was resolved that the matter concerned the judiciary and should be appealed to the court directly. (3) A letter was sent to the county government to strictly prohibit unmarried girls from practicing medicine and unregistered doctors. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Budget After the Five-Fen Per Mu Tax: The county government held its 63rd county administration meeting on the 26th, chaired by County Magistrate Jin, to discuss the following matters: (1) A telegram was received from the provincial government urging the submission of the budget for the 19th year. This budget was previously submitted to the Department of Finance on May 7th, along with a request to collect the five-fen per mu tax.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The Department of Finance has not yet approved the budget. Currently, the county's expenditure situation has slightly changed compared to the original budget. (A) The original budget for the County Property Management Office was 4,193 yuan, including 3,276 yuan for storage and preparation of supplies. The office has reported that since the separation of the charity granary, the income has been short, and the total income and expenditure for the year is insufficient by 1,274 yuan. It was resolved that 2% of the county, city, and township surtax should be extracted from the 18th year to be approved. It was resolved that the Property Management Office should prepare a detailed budget and submit it to the county for compilation. The insufficient amount of over 1,200 yuan will be supplemented from the surplus of the five-fen per mu tax. (B) The necessary expenses for the Grain Storage Management Committee were not included in the original budget for the 19th year. It was resolved to send a letter from the county to urge the committee to quickly compile and submit the budget. (C) The budgets for the County Workshop and Farm under the Bureau of Construction for the 19th year have not yet been submitted. It was resolved to send a letter urging them to prepare and report the budgets. (D) Regarding the interest on deposits, 72,000 yuan has been approved to be withdrawn from the grain reserve. Compared to the previous year, the estimated income should be reduced. It was resolved that the county government should separately instruct the Grain Storage Management Committee and the Property Management Office to list the actual amount of deposits in the budget and submit it to the county for compilation.</p>
<p>Yang Leibo of Yangxu Town Extorted by Bandits: Yang Leibo of Yangxu Town in Punan received a letter from bandits last spring demanding a huge sum of 5,000 yuan. In early June this year, the bandits wrote again, bringing up the old matter. Yang still thought it was just a threat, claiming that he had no money due to poor seed harvests. However, the bandits were unforgiving. At 3 p.m. on June 17th, when Yang was in the vegetable garden drinking tea, two bandits suddenly appeared. One bandit sat next to Yang inside, while the other guarded the street, preventing traffic. Each showed Yang a handgun. Yang, seeing the situation was not good, tried to escape but could not. His face turned pale, and he pleaded desperately. Finally, he settled the matter for 500 yuan. According to the villagers, his son, upon hearing the news at home, was afraid of being kidnapped and frantically hid in a pile of rice stalks to avoid danger. It is said that his son had a chronic illness, and this fright caused the illness to relapse. However, Yang, fearing retaliation from the bandits, dared not report the situation to the authorities.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Various Sectors Initiate Rice Stem Borer Control Campaign: Various sectors in Wu County have formed the Wu County Rice Stem Borer Control Campaign Promotion Association, divided into general affairs, publicity, and technical groups. They are scheduled to hold a promotional meeting in the urban area on July 2nd and conduct promotions in various rural areas from July 3rd to 17th. Ding Nanzhou and others have been appointed as rice stem borer control instructors.</p>
<p>Silk Weaving Industry Appeals to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for Relief: The silk weaving industry in Suzhou has been controlled by foreign merchants, leading to a decline in business. If no relief measures are taken, tens of thousands of male and female workers will face unemployment. A petition was submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting relief. The Ministry ordered an investigation and received a reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines, suggesting banning the export of dried cocoons. The Ministry asked whether banning the export of dried cocoons would save the declining satin industry and what specific relief measures the industry proposed. The industry representatives complied with the order on the 27th and submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that this year's silkworm season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang had a poor harvest, less than half of previous years. Furthermore, foreign merchants purchased extensively, taking 70% of the cocoons, leaving only 30% for domestic use, enough for only four months of work. The number of unemployed people in the future will inevitably be uncountable, and the prospects are dire. They proposed the following relief measures: (1) Promote increased production of silkworm cocoons to maintain the foundation of the silk weaving industry. (2) In the current emergency, the priority should be to retain raw materials. Prohibit the export of dried cocoons to prevent them from being exploited by foreign merchants and to provide relief. (3) Please advocate for the establishment of a national artificial silk factory to alleviate the shortage of raw materials. (4) The old case from before 1911 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce stipulated that the nine old prefectures of Suzhou, Ningbo, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Songjiang in Jiangsu Province and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province were silk-producing areas and should not add cocoon firms or cocoon stoves. Please restore this regulation to limit the industry. (5) Machine-made silk fabrics from Zhejiang Province have been approved for tax exemption, but mutual products are excluded, which will increase unemployment among workers. The situation is the same in Jiangsu Province. It is requested that the Ministry of Finance be consulted to allow the machine-made and handicrafts of Suzhou to be exempt from taxes, and to stop and reduce export tariffs and miscellaneous taxes to protect the industry. Please adopt and implement the above points.</p>
<p>Murderer Executed by Hanging: The Higher Court Prosecutor's Office executed murderer Li Xiaogengzi, also known as Li Shuchen, by hanging at the Third Prison execution ground yesterday morning (28th) at 7 a.m. Li Xiaogengzi, aged 38, was working as a reed field guard in Daxinzhou, Zhenjiang. In 1926, he stabbed Cai Youcheng to death with a knife after Cai refused to lend him money. The Dantu Court sentenced him to death, and his appeal was rejected. Yesterday, the Ministry of Justice ordered the Higher Court to carry out the execution.</p>

<p>The Dispute at the Deda Yu Silk Factory Continues: Due to the issue of improving work, a strike occurred at the Zhoushanbang Deda Yu Silk Factory. Subsequently, Ye Qiaoyun and Xu Junjie, the standing members of the labor union, went to Shanghai to negotiate and mediate with Shi Xinsheng, the general manager of the factory. They provided written proof that they would absolutely obey the factory's management and investigate those who started the trouble. Work resumed on the 25th. However, after only one day of work, a small number of female workers acted freely, demolishing a wall next to the workshop and a short wall in the toilet area. They went out freely and strolled in the square. Upon learning of this, the accounting department immediately convened an emergency meeting and questioned Ye Qiaojin, the standing member of the labor union. Ye was also deeply regretful that the female workers were not obeying management. It was then determined that Jin Xiu, the female worker who started the trouble, was handed over to the 6th Public Security Bureau to be punished for violating labor union discipline.</p>
<p>The Patrol and Lecture Team Holds a Disguised Parade: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department's patrol and lecture team arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday and went to the County Party Department to convene a discussion meeting with representatives from various agencies and schools to discuss issues such as publicity parades and convening mass rallies.

It is learned that another 89 wounded soldiers arrived in the fifth batch at about 5 a.m. yesterday morning. In the afternoon at 5 p.m., another 100 wounded soldiers and officers arrived in the sixth batch, transported by train from Nanjing. They were all cared for by members of the Wuxi Comforting Wounded Soldiers Committee and the Rear Hospital, who were dispatched to the station to transfer them to four civilian ships and transport them to the Huishan First Ward for treatment. At the same time, the Comforting Committee believed that the wounded officers and soldiers had worked hard and made great contributions to the party and the country. They raised 300 yuan in comforting funds and designated representatives Hu Nianqian from the County Party Department, Gu Yonggeng from the County Government, and Gao Zhen from the County Chamber of Commerce to bring the comforting funds to the Huishan Rear Hospital and distribute them to the wounded officers and soldiers, giving each person one yuan as a token of their appreciation.</p>
<p>Deliberations on Grain Stabilization Measures: Rice prices are soaring, and people are struggling to survive. The County Grain Storage Management Committee convened a meeting at the county government yesterday to discuss ways to open a grain stabilization program as soon as possible. The following grain stabilization measures were resolved: 25,000 yuan will be withdrawn from the grain reserve and distributed proportionally based on the acreage of land in each district (there are over 1.25 million mu of land in the 17 districts of the county), with two fen per mu. The various cities and townships will then organize grain stabilization programs. After reporting to County Magistrate Sun, the county will order each district to directly go to the Management Office to collect the allocated amount. If the districts wish to receive rice instead of funds, they can exchange their grain reserve funds for rice at the Management Office (small polished rice, over 14 yuan per stone). If they wish to receive cash, they may do so.</p>
<p>Gamblers Resist Arrest and Assault Police: Recently, some villagers in the 15th District (Fuan Township), near Hudai Town, including Yang Jia, have been opening gambling dens in a tea shop in the town, gambling all night long with large sums of money. At 11:30 p.m. the night before, Yang Shiqi, a resident of the area, reported the situation to the 14th Public Security Bureau in Zhangshe Town. Upon receiving the report, Sub-Bureau Chief Xun Dexing immediately dispatched Patrol Officer Li and over ten police officers to arrest the gamblers. Upon seeing the police, the gamblers scattered and fled. The police arrested dozens of gamblers, including Gu Qinbao, and confiscated the gambling equipment. However, just as they were leaving, many gamblers who had escaped outside shouted and rushed forward, attacking the police officers and seizing the firearms from their hands. All the arrested gamblers were taken away. The informant, Yang Shiqi, was also beaten and seriously injured. Sub-Bureau Chief Xun learned of the situation and immediately reported it to Public Security Bureau Chief Huang by phone. Chief Huang immediately dispatched Supervisor Dai Bing and dozens of police officers by steamship to the town at 6 a.m. yesterday morning to arrest the perpetrators.

The lightning struck the ridge of the easternmost room of Wang Zhixue's two-story hall house in Xiatang in the county. The roof rafters, bricks, and two skirt boards were shattered. Two electrical wires were also broken, but no one was injured. When the thunder struck, electricity scattered in all directions, sparkling terrifyingly. Residents throughout the county were shocked and frightened. Pedestrians on the road scurried away with their heads in their hands. Two reporters from the newspaper, Shao Dan and Wang Jiehui, were sipping tea at the Xinxing Tea House in front of the new county government when they suddenly felt an electric shock throughout their bodies, scaring them out of their wits. Fortunately, the power was small, and they were not in danger.</p>

Another 20000 yuan was to come from carrying over the borrowing from the 19th and 20th years' accumulated rice. Township heads were ordered to raise 20000 yuan in donations. Zhu Tinghua, Wu Tingyi, and others were designated to go to Shanghai to appeal to large merchants like Xue Liquan and Xi Ehxian for 30000 yuan in donations.

Locals said that the bandit ship had docked for two days. There were 100 or so people, mostly armed but with little ammo.

<h3>Sa Fukun Reports on the Situation of the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway Management Committee held a tea party in the conference hall of the bureau at 5:00 PM on the 24th, specially preparing refreshments and inviting Chinese and foreign journalists from the city. The committee chairman Sa Fukun, members Lu Mengxiong and Zhou Zhongqi, and several secretaries received the guests. After the refreshments, Chairman Sa reported on the progress of the railway's operations, stating: "I have been in charge here for over a month, and I have been eager to meet with you all. However, due to the initial takeover and the heavy workload, as well as my recent inspection of the entire railway and consultations with various parties, I had to travel to Jinan, which delayed our meeting. I am deeply honored by your presence today. The Jiaoji Railway is an important trunk line with heavy responsibilities. Although I have served on this railway for many years, I previously only held a position in the engineering department. Now that I am in charge, I am deeply concerned that I may not be up to the task. However, this railway operates under a committee system, and I am only one of the members. All the members are familiar with the railway's operations and work together to ensure smooth progress, avoiding any major errors. Chairman Yan, who served on the railway for a year, made many plans for the railway's operations. His resignation was due to his original position as a technical supervisor in the ministry, which involved two important positions and was too much for him to handle. Moreover, since the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, an audit committee has been set up to establish uniform technical standards, and the construction of new railways is actively underway, with technical facilities being particularly important, all of which require Yan's guidance. Yan has many years of experience as a technical supervisor in the Ministry of Communications in Peiping, so the Ministry of Railways transferred Yan to a full-time position in the ministry to utilize his expertise. As for all the rumors circulating outside, they are not credible. After taking over, I will briefly report on the important aspects of the railway's facilities: 1. Freight Rates: The revised freight rates for this railway were determined by the Ministry of Railways after careful research and are the standard practice for all railways. This railway, being state-owned, should follow suit. It is regrettable that foreigners have misunderstood this. They are unaware that the grading of freight rates is the fairest and most reasonable approach to transportation. Foreigners believe that foreign goods and domestic goods are the same, but the freight rates are vastly different, leading them to believe that the system is unfair. However, foreign goods are of high quality and high price, resulting in high consumption costs. Domestic goods are of low quality and low price, resulting in low consumption costs. Therefore, freight rates must be slightly different and there is no discrimination between Chinese and foreign goods. 2. Coal Supply: Coal is as essential to the Ministry of Railways as food is to people, and it cannot be lacking for even a day. During the German and Japanese administration of this railway, the Zichuan Coal Mine was operated by the railway. When China took over, the Washington Conference originally intended for the railway to continue operating it. However, the Japanese refused to relinquish control, and it was ultimately operated by the Sino-Japanese joint venture, Luda Company. The Sino-Japanese agreement stipulated that Luda must supply coal to the railway at a low price. Therefore, all coal was previously supplied by Luda. Last year, to promote domestic production, it was decided that Kunbo Coal Merchants and Luda would share the responsibility equally, each supplying 80,000 tons annually. The coal purchase contract with Luda has expired and is being revised. The contract with Kunbo has not yet expired, and of the original 80,000 tons, only 50,000 tons have been delivered. In the future, we will assess the railway's coal needs for the year and order them to continue supplying accordingly. Currently, Kunbo coal is transported from the mining area to the railway via a light railway, which is expensive and costly. The railway plans to build a broad-gauge railway to reduce transportation costs. The railway currently lacks vehicles and faces many difficulties in coal transportation. The Ministry of Railways has used Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase 100 forty-ton vehicles for the railway, but this is still insufficient. We plan to purchase another 100 vehicles and are currently planning this. 3. Replacement of Bridges and Rails: This city is the best port in the East. In the future, when the railway line is extended and connected to the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, all goods from the Central Plains will pass through this railway and be exported from this city. The development of the railway's transportation and the prosperity of this city will be boundless. With this vision, the railway is investing heavily in a major project to replace all the bridges on the railway to ensure long-term use. All the new bridges are designed to handle extremely heavy loads. The section east of Zhangdian has been completed, and the replacement of bridges west of Zhangdian will continue according to the original plan. There are also concrete plans to replace the rails. The original 85-pound steel rails will be replaced with 100-pound steel rails to make them stronger and more durable. This is currently underway. Furthermore, railway transportation is closely related to port administration. If there is a large volume of transportation but no good, large-scale docks for handling exports, it will be ineffective. Since the establishment of the National Government, the railway and port authorities have been able to work together. In the future, as the railway's transportation develops, the city's port must also strive to expand so that transportation can proceed smoothly. 4. Personnel Issues: Since my arrival, there have been rumors that there will be major changes in staff. However, the Ministry of Railways now strictly adheres to meritocracy in the employment of personnel on all railways. Colleagues serve on the railway to serve the country, and there will be no promotions or demotions due to personal changes. Moreover, the railway has many specialized talents, and the Ministry provides them with strong protection. Therefore, I will not easily change the existing staff. (June 25th)"</p>

<h3>Xia Douyin Leads Troops in Triumphant Return</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xia Douyin, commander of the 13th Army, previously went to Hunan with He Guoguang, chief of staff of the Wuhan Headquarters, and Qian Dajun, commander of the 3rd Central Training Division, to supervise the troops. When the division reached Yuezhou, Zhang Gui's army had already fled far away. Xia and others personally went to Changsha to plan the pursuit with the generals in Hunan. After Director He arrived in Hunan, believing that the remaining enemies would soon be eliminated and that Wuhan's security was important, he ordered Xia to lead his troops back in triumph. Upon receiving the order, Xia led Deputy Division Commander Zhu Huaibing, Brigade Commander Lu Bentang, Chief of Staff Fang Fang, Chief Secretary Jiang Youwen, and over fifty officers and guards from Changsha on the Fuyang ship at 8:00 PM on the 24th. Their troops also returned in triumph on the Dexing ship. They arrived in Hankou on the morning of the 25th. The Fuyang ship carrying Xia arrived at the Sanbei Wharf at 6:00 PM on the 25th. Among the important figures welcoming them were Wu Xingya, acting chairman of the provincial government; Huang Changgu, director of the Department of Construction; Liu Wendao, mayor of Hankou; Yang Zaichun, member of the provincial party headquarters; Zha Guangfo, member of the municipal party headquarters; and Ye Peng, chief of staff of the garrison headquarters.

<h3>Russian Bandits Infest Counties on the Black River Border</h3>
<p>Four Counties Including Huma Occupied</p>
<p>Ba Yinge Brigade Ordered to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: In the counties of Huma, Mohe, Shiwei, and Oupu on the Black River border, the people fled after the Sino-Russian conflict last year. After the Sino-Russian reconciliation, very few merchants and civilians who had fled returned to their former homes due to transportation difficulties. Not only has commerce not recovered, but many of the personnel in the various posts and government offices have not returned, leaving the border desolate. Since the beginning of the Russian incident last year, White Russians have colluded with Chinese and Korean fugitives to enter and exit the border areas, taking advantage of the military's inability to provide adequate care to loot villages and towns. Recently, they have joined forces into a large gang of several thousand, occupying the four counties of Mohe, Huma, Oupu, and Shiwei, calling themselves the "Volunteer International Army." Their leader is a White Russian named Atnaov, who has set up checkpoints in various villages and towns to collect taxes from merchants and residents, imposing various miscellaneous levies. In effect, the land along the border for twenty miles has become an extraterritorial zone. The newly appointed magistrates of Huma and Oupu counties have not dared to take office. After the opening of the Heilongjiang waterway, merchant ships, fearing detention, have shortened their routes and ceased operations. The people of these counties who wish to escape the bandits' control are unable to do so. Wan Fulin, chairman of Heilongjiang Province, fears that this will become a chronic problem that will be difficult to resolve. Therefore, he ordered Ba Yinge, commander of the Heihe Garrison, to lead troops to suppress them quickly. Ba has already dispatched the Second Infantry Regiment and has come to Harbin to negotiate with the Northeast Navigation Bureau for two merchant ships to be sent to Heihe to transport troops. In addition, Wan Fulin</p>
<p>also ordered the Fifth Regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's Second Cavalry Brigade, stationed in Manchuria, to take the Qigan route to flank Shiwei. It is reported that the bandits have sharp weapons, including heavy artillery, mortars, and handheld machine guns, and have accumulated large quantities of grain and stone. It is rumored that these are supplied by the Russian side and that the various plans are directed by specialists sent by the Soviet Union. If this is true, it may not be easy to quell the situation in the short term. (June 20th)</p>
<h3>Mastermind of Shenyang Massacre Arrested</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: All the suspects in the case of the brutal murder of eight people in the Li residence in the commercial port have been transferred by the Provincial Public Security Bureau to the local court for trial. After a preliminary hearing, the court determined that the suspicions against the four suspects, including Pi Guochen, You Qisan, Gu Zizhang, and You's wife (previously mistakenly identified as Li's wife, Huo), were more serious and ordered them to be detained for further trial. The remaining suspects were released on bail. The court has interrogated Pi, You, and the other suspects several times, but their statements have been very evasive and the court has not yet obtained any clear clues. The investigation is still ongoing. As for the main culprit in the case, Deng Haiquan, it was previously reported that he had been arrested, with some saying he was in Bamiancheng and others saying he was in Tongjiangkou. According to reliable information, the Police Department received a telegram from Bureau Chief Geng of the Liaoyang Public Security Bureau at 10:00 AM on the 21st, stating that Deng Haiquan had been captured on the morning of the 20th at the home of Hu Bingjun in the Dahuangjiatun residential area east of the county seat and that he would be sent to the province that evening. Director Sun Xuchang replied by telegram, ordering that a competent officer be dispatched to escort him to the province. The suspect, wearing a blue gown and green shoes, arrived in the province at 8:00 PM that evening. He is 29 years old and of short stature. He was immediately imprisoned and is scheduled to be sent to the court for questioning today. (June 22nd)</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary of Zhang Zuolin's Death</h3>
<p>Representatives from All Parties Attend Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The 21st was the second anniversary of Zhang Zuolin's death. At a time when the situation is turbulent and the people are suffering, Zhang Xueliang had notified all parties in advance that there would be no formal ceremony. Only a memorial service would be held at the Guan Yue Temple in Xiaonanguan for three days, from the 20th to the 22nd. Guests from all walks of life were allowed to pay their respects without restriction, and all affairs were handled by the Office of the Chief Executive. On the 20th, more than fifty leaders from military and political agencies paid their respects, with Zhang Xueming serving as the thanks-offering and host. The 21st was the main memorial day, and over a thousand people attended, including leaders from all walks of life in Shenyang, as well as representatives from Yan Xishan (Wen Shouquan, Yang Tingpu), Sun Chuanfang (Zhao Mingfu), Zhang Zuoxi (Zhang Jingwu), Jin Yunpeng (Yu Hualong), Li Jinglin (Hu Penglai), Ma Fuxiang (Bai Ruilin), Kong Xiangxi (Jiang Shouyi), the Panchen Lama (Zhong Kanbu Su Liang), and important figures from Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Harbin, such as Zhang Zuoxi, Zhang Jinghui, Bao Wenwei, and Meng Zhaotian, representative of Tang Yulin, and Mai Lianfang, representative of Wan Fulin. Among the foreign guests, the most numerous were from the Japanese side, including Consul General Hayashi Kyujiro stationed in Shenyang, Consul Fujimura, Commander of the Kwantung Army, Major General Ota Masahiro, Colonel Murata Keiichi, Commander of the Garrison, Suzuki, President of the Fengtian Japanese Residents Association, Morita Fukumatsu, and President of the South Manchuria Railway, Sengoku Mitsugu. Zhang Zuoxi had a memorial address, which read: "Alas, he was born on the mountain and became a Buddha in heaven. Suddenly, past and present are determined by fate. Heaven has not tired of the chaos, sending down a righteous man to save the people. An outstanding man of the world returns to heaven, a star falls, a great tree withers, and heaven is drunk. The people are suffering, and two years have passed. How can we not grieve for the weeping willows of Xinpu? The rivers and mountains remain intact, and the people are at peace. His legacy is profound, and scholars sing his praises. His generals and subordinates are still loyal, and new troops are added. We remember his heroic strategies with tears of sorrow. The Central Plains is in turmoil, with the鷸蚌之爭. If you, sir, did not act, who would care about the people's livelihood? Internal troubles have not ended, and external threats are growing. If you, sir, did not act, who would revitalize the nation's foundation? The country and the people face difficult times ahead. May the spirit of heaven embrace and comfort us. We deeply fear that we will be unable to fulfill our future responsibilities. We walk on thin ice as we guard the great cause. Red bananas, lychees, fine wine, and famous incense, we offer them with sincerity. Come and enjoy this offering. May you accept it." (June 22nd)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Maintains Chunhui Middle School</h3>
<p>Chunhui Middle School in Shangyu County was suddenly attacked by bandits on the 15th of this month, and the principal, Fan Shou Kang, teacher Wu Minxing, and student Xia Dingcai were kidnapped. Details were reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the school board of directors, due to the panic caused by the bandit attack, decided to temporarily suspend operations and submitted a request to the Education Department for record-keeping. Yesterday, the Education Department replied, stating: "We have received your telegram and immediately dispatched personnel to the school to investigate and offer condolences. We have also telegraphed the commander of the 6th Regiment of the Baiguan Security Team and the magistrate of Shangyu County, ordering them to quickly cooperate in the arrest and rescue efforts and to provide additional protection. We have also reported to the provincial government, ordering the Security Team and the County Government to handle the matter promptly. The sudden bandit attack on the school is an unexpected incident, and we are deeply saddened by the widespread panic in the school. However, a school that has been operating for many years and has a distinguished record should not be closed down. This would not only violate the original intention of the directors to nurture talent but would also affect the academic future of hundreds of students. The directors have worked hard in the past and should continue to persevere and overcome difficulties in order to achieve greater success. The Department has high hopes for you."</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teachers in Zhejiang Province's Counties and Cities</h3>
<p>Summer Training Session Adds Course on Cooperation</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department issued an order to the governments of each city and county, stating: "We have received a communication from the Department of Construction, stating: 1. The cooperative system is a convenient way for the people to help themselves and each other, and it is a good method for economic liberation. The Party has designated the cooperative movement as one of the seven major movements. The recent Central Plenary Session also stipulated that the cooperative movement is the fundamental method for thrift and economic construction, which shows its importance. 2. Since the Department has been managing the cooperative business, we have spared no effort in publicity and guidance. However, to promote the universality of cooperation so that all people in the countryside can use and benefit from it, it is not enough to rely on the efforts of a few cooperative business promoters. We should find ways to convey cooperative knowledge to elementary school teachers so that they can spread it in the countryside, enabling the people to automatically organize various cooperative societies to promote its expansion. 3. Your Department has organized summer training sessions for elementary school teachers this year, which is a great opportunity to popularize cooperative knowledge. 4. We have drafted methods for adding a cooperative course to the summer training sessions for elementary school teachers and staff in each county and are consulting with you for review and ordering the counties to add the course." In addition to replying, we are copying the methods and ordering the county government to comply with them.</p>

We have sent a letter to consult with the Central Training Department. The Central Training Department has replied: 'We have found that there is a shortage of Party Ideology teachers and training directors in various localities, and many have submitted requests for instructions on how to remedy the situation. The headquarters has statistically analyzed the total number of qualified Party Ideology teachers and training directors in various localities and compared it to the demand in schools at all levels. The shortage is indeed excessive and requires a quick solution. We will report this situation to the Central Standing Committee, which has resolved to have the headquarters formulate a complete solution and submit it for resolution. Please be informed.'"</p>

<p>Wu Xiaohou, who has served as a supervisor of studies in the Huaiyang region, a social education instructor in Jiangsu Province, and a graduate of the National Language Department of Nanjing Higher Normal School and the first class of the National Language Training Institute of the Ministry of Education, has been actively involved in the national language movement for over ten years. He recently returned from Japan, where he studied municipal administration and social education. Although the Central Ministry of Education is now working hard to promote the National Phonetic Alphabet, Wu believes that implementing it in government documents would be more effective than just promoting it. He recently suggested to the Ministry of Education that the Ministry should submit a request to the Executive Yuan, which would then submit it to the National Government and the Central Political Conference, that all administrative, transportation, and education agencies should use the national language and script as much as possible in their daily correspondence. He also suggested that they should limit themselves to using the national language and common Mandarin in their daily conversations. He further suggested that all agency staff and employees should spend an hour or half an hour each day studying the National Phonetic Alphabet and practicing the national language, such as the station announcements and official conversations at railway stations, the teaching courses of teachers in schools, and the general language used by telephone operators. This should start with the administrative, transportation, and education agencies so that people can learn by ear and eye and become accustomed to it unconsciously, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Wu has authored many books, including the National Language Grammar and the Illustrated National Language Grammar. The latter was approved and distributed by the former Ministry of Education, and he was also awarded a bonus. Wu Hui, a senior member of the Party and state, praised it as an unprecedented masterpiece in the national language field.</p>

<h3>Shanghai High School Holds Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Shanghai High School, Jiangsu Province, will hold the Second Semester Art Department Achievement Exhibition at the junior high school department of the school on Shangwen Road, Xiaoximen, today (28th) and tomorrow. All works, totaling over 1,000 pieces, will be displayed in separate rooms and open to the public. Visiting hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily.</p>
<h3>Municipal School National Language and Arithmetic Exhibition Opens</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education's National Language and Arithmetic Achievement Exhibition opened yesterday morning. The opening ceremony was held in Xicheng for the National Language Department and in Meixi for the Arithmetic Department. Bureau Chief Chen, Mayor's representative Cen Dechang, and department heads and supervisors of the Bureau of Education, as well as teachers and students from various schools, totaling 600 people, attended. Bureau Chief Chen chaired the meeting, and Zhang Angqian served as the secretary. The ceremony was carried out according to protocol.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Today marks the opening of the National Language and Arithmetic Achievement Exhibition. All works from the National Language and Arithmetic subjects completed by students from various schools will be publicly displayed, allowing parents to understand their children's performance, and teachers to understand the results of their teaching. Most importantly, students can observe themselves and others, and learn from each other. Those who are superior to us should be taken as models, and those who are inferior to us can also use us as models. Do not be jealous of those who are superior to us, strive to improve ourselves, and we will be able to catch up. Do not be arrogant towards those who are inferior to us. Learning has no end, and we should continue to strive for excellence. In this way, mutual encouragement will bring great benefits. This exhibition is different from last year's administrative achievement exhibition because it is an exhibition of the students' own achievements. Teachers and students alike are very interested. If it can be held once a year to compare progress from year to year, the results will be even more significant. Recently, only three people were ranked "A" in the joint elementary school graduation examination. The first and second places belonged to private schools, while the municipal school was third. Of those ranked in the top ten, only two or three were from municipal schools. The facilities and teachers of municipal schools are no worse than those of private schools, yet the academic performance is as such. Can we not feel regret? I sincerely hope that all of you children will study hard and strive for progress. Do not be complacent, and do not give up on yourselves. This is what I expect from all of you. Teachers who lead the students should take this opportunity to earnestly guide them and be vigilant in their work. Achieving good results will be easy. I also hope that visitors from all walks of life will not hesitate to give us their guidance.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>The representative Cen Dechang gave a speech. The mayor, due to pressing matters, could not attend, and instructed me to represent him. He spoke about the significance of the National Language and Arithmetic Exhibition. We regard national language and arithmetic as the foundation of all learning. If the foundation is not solid, it will be difficult to study any subject in the future, whether it is law, politics, economics, medicine, engineering, physiology, or zoology. All kinds of knowledge are treasures in a box, and national language and arithmetic are like the keys. Only with the key can we obtain the treasures. To enter university in the future, there is also a key: national language. However, national language is still the most important. I don't know why Chinese people call national language the key to opening the box. One key point is whether the size of the key is suitable, and the other is how to open the box. Regardless of national language or arithmetic, the only method is to practice more. I feel that the current elementary schools have too much teaching and too little practice. This is something that should be paid attention to. This exhibition is the first of its kind. I hope that it will be held more often in the future. I predict that the results will gradually improve.</p>
<h3>County Bureau of Education Inspection and Guidance Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Bureau of Education held its fifth inspection and guidance meeting yesterday. Those present were Director Shi, Shen Jing, Sun Tingfang, Niu Zhiyi, Yang Huimin, Lin Qing, and Zhu Hange. Director Shi chaired the meeting, and Zhu Hange served as the secretary. The ceremony was carried out according to protocol. The report of items was brief, followed by discussion of the following matters: (1) Discussion of the "Standards for Excellent Schools" proposal. The resolution was amended and passed. (2) What form should the inspection and guidance report for this semester take? The resolution was that supervisors would still report in writing. The standards for excellent schools are as follows: 1. Moral education has concrete standards and can be effectively implemented. 2. The environment is arranged in a way that reflects the Three Principles of the People, is scientific, and artistic, and appeals to children's psychology. 3. Can serve as a community center. 4. Can implement economic and open methods in a practical manner. 5. School buildings and equipment can be used economically. 6.

<h3>Vocational Guidance Center Relocates to New Location</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has recently published a "Guidance for Further Education" book for educational guidance. Recently, the Taicang Kunshan County Junior High School invited them to give a lecture on vocational guidance, which was delivered by Chen Xuanxian and Pan Yangyao. In addition, many schools have requested assistance in finding talent (a certain county in Guangdong requested assistance in finding two mass education instructors with a monthly salary of 200 yuan), which is currently being negotiated. The center and the China Vocational Education Society will be relocating to the new location at the intersection of Hualong Road and Ruilong Road today. Everything is still being organized, so conversation registration will be temporarily suspended for three days and will resume as usual on July 2nd.</p>
<h3>Art Garden to Host Public Lecture Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Bichu, who recently returned to China from France, will give a lecture on French art.</p>
<p>The Art Garden on Lin Yin Road, Ximen, is an organization formed by artists dedicated to the study of Chinese and Western painting and the promotion of art. Today, Saturday, June 28th, at 2:00 PM, the Art Garden will host a public lecture by painter Zhou Bichu, who recently returned from France, on French art at the painting research institute founded by the Art Garden's members. Mr. Zhou studied painting in France for many years and has deep knowledge of painting. Those who love and study art are welcome to attend the lecture. It is also reported that they plan to invite experts to give public lectures on a regular basis in the future.</p>
<h3>Ge Gongzhen to Lecture in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou YMCA recently organized a Journalism Research Association, with the aim of arousing young people's interest in studying journalism and providing journalists with an opportunity to exchange knowledge. Recently, the association specially invited Mr. Ge Gongzhen to provide guidance and lectures. Mr. Ge has agreed to go to Hangzhou with Mr. Huang Jiping on July 1st for about four days, giving three lectures. The first lecture is [The Past, Present, and Future of Newspapers]. The second lecture is [The Current Situation of the Newspaper Industry in the Old Concession]. The third lecture is [The Awareness that the Chinese Newspaper Industry Should Have]. Mr. Ge will also bring lantern slides, films, and newspaper materials from various countries for observation.</p>
<h3>Jinan Alumni Association Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Current and former principals will attend.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhang Feng did not accept the invitation from Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>The National Jinan University Shanghai Alumni Association is scheduled to hold a general meeting at the Datong Restaurant in Shanghai at noon today. The agenda includes: 1. Reporting on association affairs; 2. Re-electing the next session's staff; 3. Inviting President Zheng, Vice President Hong, former President Ke, and President Jiang to the meeting for guidance; 4. Welcoming this year's graduating classmates; 5. Taking a group photo of all members; 6. Dining; 7. Entertainment. All new and old invited classmates are requested to arrive on time. In addition, the school has many talented individuals who have been sought after by various places. Previously, a university in a certain province proposed two candidates for president, both of whom were from the school, but neither of them agreed to it. President Zheng treats people with courtesy and sincerity, and everyone is willing to work hard for overseas Chinese here. Recently, there was news that Dr. Zhang Feng, the inventor of the "Number Shape Lookup Method," who has been dormant for a long time and does not want to move, was going to be appointed in Sichuan, but this was all a misunderstanding. During the spring break, the Sichuan Provincial Education Authority entrusted Nanjing to find someone to go to Sichuan for lectures for two months during the summer vacation. Mr. Zhang had contacted them once and also planned to take this opportunity to gain some knowledge in archeology, but it was not a long-term teaching position. However, due to the obstruction of the Yangtze River, it has been abandoned. Those who are concerned about the doctor's whereabouts can rest assured. It is worth noting that many of the school's faculty and staff have achieved great success after leaving the school, which shows that there are many talented people at the school.</p>
<h3>Pre-Announcement of Jiaotong University Graduation Ceremony</h3>
<p>Since President Sun Ke and Vice President Li Zhaohuan took over the National Jiaotong University on Haig Road in Shanghai, they have spared no effort to expand and reorganize the school's affairs.

<h3>Reclamation of</h3>
<p>Concession Telephone Rights Case</p>
<p>Ke Yinhan's Reply Is Ambiguous</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Is Determined to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Regarding the reclamation of concession telephone rights, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office received a reply from Consul-General Ke Yinhan yesterday morning. The original text was quite lengthy, stating roughly that upon receiving your ministry's note, everything regarding the reclamation of concession telephone rights had been communicated, with the Public Negotiation Office and the Consular Body having exchanged numerous documents over time, resulting in a substantial accumulation of files. Therefore, a summary is provided below for reference (details omitted). Ultimately, it boils down to the issue of the sale of the China and Foreign Telephone Company. The Consular Body had no prior knowledge of this matter, and therefore cannot provide a definitive response to your ministry's note. It is reported that the company will convene a shareholders' meeting on the 27th (i.e., yesterday) to resolve this issue, and there should be a solution, etc. The language is extremely ambiguous. Deputy Director Liu Yunfang presented Ke Yinhan's reply to Foreign Minister Wang yesterday morning. Wang immediately sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' General Affairs Department for record. According to Foreign Minister Wang, this matter will be resolutely contested by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Communications working together.</p>
<h3>China and Foreign Telephone Company</h3>
<p>Convenes Special Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Mostly Foreigners in Attendance</p>
<p>Discussing the Sale Issue</p>
<p>Majority Vote Passes</p>
<p>The Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company convened a special shareholders' meeting at the Royal Asiatic Society at No. 5, Museum Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the transfer of its operations to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Over a hundred shareholders attended, mostly foreigners, with only six Chinese shareholders present. The meeting was chaired by the company's chairman, Lai Boli, who reported on the progress and formally proposed accepting the revised bid from the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Director Pei Er seconded the proposal. The proposal was then opened for discussion among the shareholders. Two shareholders spoke, one being Niumen, who advocated for further revisions to the proposal, and the other being Lu Deng, who advocated for rejecting the proposal. After about an hour of debate, the chairman put the original proposal to a vote, and it passed with a majority of hands raised. Lu Deng then proposed to the chairman that the original proposal be put to another vote. As a result, the original proposal also passed with a majority vote.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Lai Boli's report stated roughly that the purpose of convening this meeting was to consider the sale of the company's operations to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. The contents of the proposal have been distributed to all shareholders. The history of negotiations regarding this matter and the adoption of automatic telephones in Shanghai have also been detailed in the notice, and need not be repeated. However, it must be stated that the board of directors has always felt that the adoption of rotary automatic telephones in this port has been subject to careful and thorough consideration and expert advice. If it were not discovered that this system was not suitable for Shanghai, there would be no reason to dismantle it and install another system. As to whether it is ultimately applicable, it has been discussed in detail in the notice, and the Anson report has also mentioned that it can be reviewed. After the second bid from the three companies, the advisory committee suggested strongly accepting the bid from the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, and the board of directors also agreed to this proposal. Now, the Public Works Bureau and the Public Board have also approved the transfer of the concession to the company. The final notice of the 19th of this month has conveyed to you, gentlemen, the various points of agreement in the company's bid. The company's financial position is naturally not a problem. The valuation layer has also been discussed in detail. I dare say that this matter has been considered by the board of directors with extreme caution, recognizing that the price offered by the company is very fair, because shareholders can obtain cash or exchange one old share for one and a half new company shares. It should be known that if the stock is priced too high, the new company will have a larger investment, and the result will inevitably be higher interest rates, the burden of which will still fall on the users. Therefore, the board of directors recommends accepting the company's bid, and hereby proposes [that all revised bids from the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, as described in the letter from Mr. Qi Er, Deputy General Manager of the company, to the chairman of the board of directors of this company on April 15, 1930, be immediately accepted, but if the board of directors of this company believes that there are any changes that should be made, they may be changed, and the board of directors is hereby authorized to transfer the operations of this company to the new company referred to in the previous letter, and to negotiate all necessary agreements and methods. I hereby propose] that all shareholders discuss it.</p>
<p>Negotiation Issues: During the meeting, a foreign shareholder stood up and asked about the company's attitude towards negotiations with the Chinese side and whether the company had received any official documents from the Chinese government. Director Pei Er of the company replied that when the reorganization of the telephone company was initiated, there was no objection from the Chinese side. The Chinese government raised negotiations in mid-month, at which time the Public Works Bureau of the two concessions had already decided on a solution to this problem. However, for the sake of future Sino-foreign cooperation, the concession authorities and the company are very willing to gain the goodwill of the Chinese side, and hope to reach a compromise with the Chinese government in the future. As for the Chinese side's objecting documents, in addition to a letter from Yu Qiaqing yesterday notifying the cancellation of the voting of Chinese shareholder representatives, there were no other official documents exchanged, etc. According to the company's articles of association, the quorum for a shareholders' meeting is only five people, but those five people must be able to represent one-fifth of the total capital. The proposal must be approved by two-thirds of the people present.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Reaction: First, a shareholder who signed his name posted a large advertisement in various Western newspapers, stating roughly that of the three bidders this time, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation offered the lowest price, valuing each share at only seventy-five taels, while the interest it demanded on investment was 10 percent, which was the highest of the three. Compared to the lowest company's 6 percent, it demanded 4 percent more. Assuming that the new company completely renovates to an automatic telephone system and the invested capital is over 13 million, the additional interest would require over 530,000 taels per year. If allocated among 29,000 users, each household would have to pay 18 taels more in telephone charges per year. Now the company's directors want to ask shareholders to accept the bid from the company that offers the lowest price and demands the most compensation, forcing users to increase their burden by at least eighteen taels per year. Moreover, according to expert Mr. Anson's report, the Ericsson automatic telephone is recognized as the best telephone for the next few years. In terms of shareholders wanting to obtain cash, at the current exchange rate, 75 taels can only be converted into 5 pounds, 10 shillings, and 1 penny, which is 28 percent less than the gold price at the time of the January 6 bid.</p>
<h3>Government Maintains Food Supply</h3>
<p>Bans Rice Merchants from Manipulating and Hoarding; The Municipal Government Issues a Proclamation Yesterday:</p>
<p>Regarding the proclamation, it has been reported that the price of rice in the city has been rising incessantly in recent days, with the highest price of rice exceeding 20 yuan per stone, which is unprecedented. An investigation revealed that the city's rice supply is mainly transported from various producing areas in Jiangsu and Anhui, as well as Siam and Saigon. A survey of rice shops throughout the city found sufficient rice reserves, estimated to be several hundred thousand stones. In addition, foreign rice stored in various foreign warehouses also amounts to several hundred thousand bags, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the citizens. There is no shortage. This price increase is actually caused by a small number of unscrupulous merchants manipulating and hoarding. Such behavior, which only considers self-interest and disregards the people's food supply, is truly a scourge of society and is extremely hateful. A thorough investigation and strict punishment should be carried out. In addition to ordering the Social Security Bureau and other bureaus to conduct a strict investigation and handle the matter severely, the Rice Price Stabilization Committee is also ordered to actively proceed. A proclamation is hereby issued to inform all citizens that the city's rice supply is abundant and not lacking. If there are unscrupulous merchants manipulating and hoarding, please report the facts and name names. Once verified, the hoarded rice will be confiscated and the perpetrators will be severely punished as a warning to others. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Verifying the Retail Prices of Rice Stores; Rice Boats Arriving at Northern Shanghai Must Register with the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Rice boats arriving at Northern Shanghai must first report to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration and obtain a registration certificate. Only after the Northern Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Office has evaluated the price can the rice be unloaded. Rice merchants then purchase and distribute the rice to the rice stores. The Tin and Xian gangs have been able to take care of the overall situation, prioritizing the people's food supply and complying with orders. However, the Chang gang rice boats have repeatedly resisted stubbornly, disregarding the people's food supply and only caring about private interests. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to deal with them severely, and is concerned that they may collude with the rice merchants to secretly unload the rice and package it in warehouses. Yesterday, it specifically instructed the Bean and Rice Industry Association's Northern Shanghai Office to pay close attention. During the public evaluation period, rice boats from the riverfront that have not been evaluated by the office and purchased by rice merchants must not be unloaded without authorization. If there is unauthorized unloading, packaging in warehouses, or a shortage of capacity, the office will be held responsible. Rice stores that purchase rice at the limited price must sell it at the limited price, with no profit margin in between. The expenses are huge and difficult to maintain. They have repeatedly requested the Social Affairs Bureau to allow them to take a profit of 5%, in order to maintain their livelihoods. The Social Affairs Bureau has now verified and tentatively approved a profit of 2.5%. During the limited price period, the retail price of the highest quality white rice can only be sold up to 21.5 yuan per stone. Violations will be punished as violations of the limited price. The full text of the proclamation was also announced to the public yesterday as follows: Regarding the proclamation, the highest price of white rice in this city has been limited to 21 yuan. Any hidden price increases will be severely punished upon discovery. All rice arriving at the Northern Shanghai riverfront must first register with the officials dispatched by this bureau before obtaining a certificate and signature to be sent to the Northern Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association for evaluation and unloading within the limited price range. The rice will then be distributed to the various rice stores by the rice merchant organization's management committee for sale. However, the rice merchants claim that they are complying with the limited price for all rice coming in and out, with no profit margin. All expenses are difficult to maintain. If they increase the price for sale, it will be a violation of government orders and subject to punishment. They have requested a discretionary profit to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. After verification, the claims are found to be true. It is now verified and approved that all rice sold by rice merchants to consumers will be subject to a discretionary increase of 2.5% in the general market price. During the current limited price period, the highest quality white rice must not be sold for more than 21.5 yuan. Medium and lower quality rice must still be priced separately. In addition to a separate order to the Rice Merchant Organization Management Committee to inform all rice stores to comply, a proclamation is hereby issued to inform the citizens. From now on, rice purchases must be made in accordance with these regulations. If any rice store demands a high price or sells inferior rice, please report it to this bureau or send a sample to the bureau for verification and investigation in order to punish the unscrupulous. This concerns the welfare of the public. At this time of year, when there is a shortage of food, it is hoped that citizens will cooperate and not easily believe rumors in the rice market, but remain calm so that this bureau's policy of maintaining the food supply can be implemented. This proclamation is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Registration of Rice and Grain Arrival and Departure in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rice boats are not allowed to leave until the rice is completely unloaded.</p>
<p>Registration is required for loading foreign rice to aid the inland areas.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association issued Notice No. Wu-Zi-13 to all members yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"Respectfully received the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau's Instruction No. 2493, opening as follows: In compliance with orders, this Bureau first conducted rice boat registration in Xinzha, which has already been implemented. Subsequently, rice boats arriving in Shanghai are not allowed to leave the city until the rice is completely unloaded, and the Water Patrol Team is responsible for enforcement. As for the matter of packaging foreign rice, it concerns the supply of food to the people in the inland areas, and it can be loaded and transported, but the association must provide a truthful certificate and ensure that there is no smuggling, so that the Water Patrol Team can inspect and release the goods. In addition to separate orders, the association is hereby ordered to comply with this order and immediately record and notify all members that from now on, all foreign rice loaded for the supply of food to the people in the inland areas must be reported to the association at the Cuixiu Hall in the Yuyuan Garden in the Chenghuang Temple area, and a certificate must be obtained, which must not be smuggled, so that the Water Patrol Team can inspect and release the goods. This is of utmost importance. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<h3>News of Flexible Cargo Collection at Tianjin Customs</h3>
<p>Reported by Tianjin Telegraph Office Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>After the Tianjin Customs issue regarding cargo going to and entering customs warehouses arose, a major dispute was triggered due to tax payment issues. Yesterday, a British shipping company in Shanghai received a telegram from Tianjin stating that cargo loaded for Tianjin after the 20th, regardless of whether it was reported as original imports or had passes and was exempt from customs duties, would still be subject to full import duties by Tianjin Customs. If merchants were unwilling to pay, the cargo would be prohibited from inspection and unloading, and most of it had already entered customs warehouses.</p>
<p>Cargo arriving faced difficulties. The Taikoo Shipping Company's Fengtian Wheel ship encountered significant difficulties when shipping cargo from Tianjin to Shanghai. According to the ship's crew, Tianjin Customs demanded the payment of half of the regular tax when the ship reported for export in Tianjin. After lengthy negotiations, the shipowner personally reported the matter to the British Consulate, and the consulate notified Tianjin Customs that the export customs declaration had been signed by the consulate and the tax had been taken into custody, and that the ship's schedule should not be delayed due to disputes. The cargo on the Fengtian Wheel ship was then allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Shanghai Customs is busy inspecting goods. According to custom, Shanghai Customs does not need to open and inspect taxed goods exported from Shanghai. Now, because Tianjin Customs denies that all types of goods shipped to Tianjin must be opened for inspection, Shanghai Customs inspectors have been very busy inspecting goods at various wharves in recent days. In order to counter Tianjin Customs' suspension of inspection of imported goods, Shanghai Customs is also planning to put all Tianjin goods that have not paid taxes into customs warehouses.</p>
<p>Tianjin Customs' flexible measures: At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a customs broker in Shanghai received an urgent telegram from Tianjin stating that Tianjin Customs has already changed its measures. For goods shipped from Shanghai for which half of the import tax has already been collected by Shanghai Customs, as long as evidence of tax payment is presented, inspection and unloading will be allowed. Upon hearing this news, many customs brokers in Shanghai consulted with Shanghai Customs and obtained a new method, that is, from yesterday onwards, when reporting export goods, customs brokers will make an extra copy of the declaration (a total of three copies) and ask Shanghai Customs to stamp it for forwarding to Tianjin as proof of payment of half of the tax for cargo collection. Upon hearing this news, many merchants telegraphed Tianjin to inquire whether this was true.</p>
<p>Chinese ships are still waiting and watching. Shanghai's Beiyang Shipping Company initially planned to suspend services to Tianjin, but yesterday it heard that inspection and unloading of cargo could be flexible. The company's Tianjin liners will have to wait and see for another day or two before deciding whether to suspend services.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Management Office</h3>
<p>All Stations to Close by the End of This Month</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Flights Will Also Be Suspended Simultaneously</p>
<p>Temporarily Taken Over by the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>Nie Kaiyi's Conversation</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Management Office was ordered to close, the Shanghai station has begun clearing everything. The reporter interviewed Nie Kaiyi, director of the Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Management Office, yesterday to inquire about various matters, which are detailed below:</p>
<p>Closure by the end of the month: Mr. Nie said that the Shanghai-Chengdu air route has been operating for almost a year. Although there have been no significant achievements, fortunately it has been able to pass safely. The route will be merged with the China-American Aviation Corporation due to the revision of the contract to strengthen the organization. All stations are now scheduled to close completely before June 30 and stop working. The issue of disposing of the staff is currently being discussed thoroughly, and they may be employed by the new organization at its discretion.</p>
<p>Suspension of Beijing-Shanghai flights: After the closure on June 30, flights on the Beijing-Shanghai route will also be suspended. Flights on the Shanghai-Hankou route of the China Aviation Corporation will continue to operate as usual and will not be affected. After the Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Management Office closes, it will be temporarily taken over by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>Signing of the new contract: Mr. Nie also said that Minister of Communications Wang Boqun came to Shanghai this morning (yesterday morning) and that the new contract between China and the United States on aviation is expected to be formally signed within this week, so the new organization will be completed within a month, and efforts will be concentrated on active development.</p>
<p>Content of the new organization: Regarding the content of the new contract, China will account for 55 percent of the capital and the United States will account for 45 percent. Administrative and personnel matters will be allocated accordingly. The highest-level executives will be the board of directors, with five directors, three Chinese and two American. A chairman and vice chairman will be elected, with the Chinese side holding the position of chairman. The person selected has not yet been determined. There will be three departments: Finance, Business, and Aviation. Except for the director of Aviation, who will be American, the rest will be Chinese, with Americans serving as deputy directors.</p>
<p>Three major air routes: After the establishment of the new organization, the first step is to complete the air route from Shanghai to Chengdu in the shortest possible time. The second route is from Nanjing to Beiping, which will be flown by Shanghai-Chengdu aircraft in the future. The third route is from Hankou to Guangzhou. The number of aircraft will also be expanded as much as possible, he said.</p>

<h3>Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity Workers' Strike: Yesterday's News</h3>
<p>The Franco-Chinese Water and Electricity Workers' Union, considering the numerous requests for assistance from various sectors during the strike of all workers, has established a temporary office near the Municipal Party Committee in Laoximen. Furthermore, it plans to establish additional offices at Tianhougong Bridge in the French Concession and Baoshan Road in Zhabei to facilitate close contact with various sectors and expand the strike to prepare for a prolonged struggle against the capitalists.</p>
<h3>Great Increase in Shipping Costs for European Bound Lake Silk</h3>
<p>Effective July 1st</p>
<p>Since the new silk came onto the market, European and American countries have been purchasing and shipping it. However, due to the declining silver prices, the export volume of Chinese silk has not significantly increased. Recently, British and French mail steamship companies in this port, facing substantial losses due to silver pricing and rising gold prices, already increased shipping rates once on April 1st. Now, after a second meeting, they have further increased shipping costs, with increases of up to two taels per piece compared to the original rate. Compared to prices before April, the increase is approximately six taels per piece, which is truly shocking. The old and new shipping rates are listed below:</p>

<h3>China Youth</h3>
<p>Walking Group Departs This Morning</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>The China Youth Asia Walking Group, which has been busy socializing for a week, received a final farewell yesterday afternoon at Xueyuan from social organizations such as the Yousheng Travel Group, Dongfang Bookstore, Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association, and Jingwu Athletic Association. Over thirty celebrities attended, including Zhou Shoujuan, Yan Duhe, Hu Boxiang, Huang Jingwan, Huang Wan, Zhu Mingguang, Lang Jingshan, Chen Binhe, Zheng Jiaguan, Liu Yuqi, Ye Qianyu, Peng Wangshi, Lin Zecang, and Chu Fumin. Huang Xincun delivered a farewell speech, stating that the group's arduous ten-thousand-mile journey, including the participation of three female comrades, was to raise the eyebrows of the Chinese nation, dispel the shame of being the "sick man of East Asia," and eradicate the negative reputation of being weak and timid. He expressed sincere admiration and, on behalf of the various organizations present, extended deep respect and wished them good health on their long journey. Huang Menggui, former Director of Education of Fujian Province, gave a speech emphasizing that the Chinese nation had been in decline for a long time and that the life of Chinese youth was becoming increasingly decadent. To reverse this trend, it was best to promote the development of a spirit of perseverance among young people. Having visited the Malay Peninsula three times, he noted the oppression of overseas Chinese by British imperialism and hoped that, in addition to traveling, the group would also promote nationalism. Lang Jingshan spoke about his experiences in travel photography and the history of Chinese photographic art, hoping that Li, who was in charge of photography, would pay attention to subject matter and photographic techniques to benefit fellow enthusiasts. Zhu Mingguang, a leader of female teachers in Guangdong, spoke, saying that the war in the Central Plains was intensifying, with short-range combat and fierce fighting unseen in recent years. Aspiring young people should seek education through walking rather than dying unnecessarily. She hoped that, in addition to walking, the group would awaken the united front of weak nations. She added that when the group passed through Guangzhou in the future, she would lead female teachers to welcome them. Zheng Jiaguan, a member of the Yousheng Standing Committee, stated that the group had been promoting travel for fifteen years, and the activities of its three thousand members had shown that travel could regulate the hardships of life and cultivate noble and pure thoughts and a spirit of cooperation. He hoped that Chang Xichang would write an article for the monthly magazine to meet the expectations of comrades. Huang Yue, the group's public relations director, reported on the organization and progress of the group after its establishment. Qiu Fang, a sixteen-year-old female member, spoke about wanting to overthrow the thousands-year-old tradition of prioritizing men over women, closing doors and restricting women, hindering their happiness, and bad habits. She wanted to resist the environment and be a pioneer for narrow-minded and weak-willed female compatriots, breaking previous records, not only to raise the spirits of women but also to enhance international prestige. Finally, the reporters took photographs and shouted slogans. The Guangyi and National Photography Exhibition took pictures and then dispersed. At 7:00 PM that evening, the Juvenile Magazine, Qingyou Newspaper, Jinan Film Company, and others held a banquet at the China Women's Physical Education School, with dancing and music. The group decided to depart from the North Station at 10:00 AM this morning, with hundreds of people from various sectors coming to see them off, which can be described as an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<h3>In the Dead of Night</h3>
<p>Thugs Attack Shooting Range</p>
<p>Scared Off by Guard and Workers</p>
<p>Thugs Fired Shots But Missed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council North Sichuan Road Firing Range is adjacent to Hongkou Park. Except for occasional shooting practice, it is usually deserted. Yesterday morning, around 1:30 AM, the guard on duty was about to doze off when he suddenly heard sixteen or seventeen thugs armed with weapons intending to rob the premises and fired shots as a warning. The reporter's investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Many Thugs: The Hongkou Firing Range is located at the end of North Sichuan Road, connected to Hongkou Park to the south and Jiangwan Road to the north. After midnight, except for recent hot weather that brings people out for late-night strolls, it is very quiet. The streetlights are also dim. Yesterday morning, around 1:30 AM, the guard on duty was dozing off when he heard many footsteps. They were close to the wall, whispering indistinctly. Taking his responsibility seriously, the guard shouted, "Who is there?" The voices outside stopped. The guard opened the door and saw a crowd of thugs in the darkness, about sixteen or seventeen in number, all wearing short clothes.</p>
<p>Gunshots in the Night: Seeing the crowd of thugs, the guard knew that he was not equipped to fight back and retreated, closing the door and summoning the twenty-odd workers on the premises. With a shout, the workers burst out, yelling, "Catch the thieves!" Hearing the warning, the thugs ran forward wildly, then turned back and fired three or four shots. However, in the darkness, their aim was poor, and the bullets fortunately missed everyone. Seeing the sparks, the workers knew the bullets were merciless and stopped advancing, letting the thugs escape.</p>
<p>Escaping Across the River: Knowing that the pursuers had stopped, the thugs slowed down. The guard and workers, emboldened by the thugs' lack of gunfire, regained their courage and pursued them, blowing whistles and vowing not to give up until they had captured the thieves. Fearing that the pursuers were detectives, the thugs ran wildly north, only to find a river blocking their path. With no way forward and pursuers behind, they had no choice but to jump into the river. However, the river was narrow and deep, and the thugs struggled in the water. By the time the pursuers arrived, the thugs had already crossed the river and fired three more shots from the other side, which also missed.</p>
<p>Apprehending the Remnants: The guard and workers, unarmed and unable to swim, could only rely on their shouts to scare away the thugs. Seeing the thugs repeatedly firing shots, they feared for their safety and stopped the pursuit. They immediately reported to the Des Voeux Road Police Station for assistance. Upon receiving the report, the police station dispatched detectives to the scene and apprehended a remnant of the thugs, a man from Jiangbei, who was taken into custody. According to the reporter's investigation, it is said that the firing range stores a large quantity of ammunition. It is suspected that the thugs came to rob the ammunition or to cause trouble and commit illegal activities.</p>
<h3>In Yesterday's Heavy Rain</h3>
<p>Various Incidents in Pudong</p>
<p>All Caused by Electrical Fires</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the weather was hot and humid. In the evening, dark clouds gathered, and around 7:00 PM, a violent storm of wind and rain arrived, accompanied by thunder and lightning. The storm lasted for about an hour. Unexpectedly, during the heavy rain, four electrical fires occurred simultaneously near Tangqiao Town in Pudong, which is unprecedented in the area. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ice Storage Room Destroyed: The ice factory established by Zhang Akun in Jiangjiadu, Bailianjing, south of Tangqiao Town in Pudong, had two ice storage rooms. The interior was constructed of bamboo and covered with a thick layer of straw. The area was very large, and a lot of ice was stored each year. The ice stored this year (collected last year) had already been sold out. Unexpectedly, during the heavy rain last night, a large electrical fire landed on the roof of the ice storage room, immediately igniting the straw. The rain could not extinguish the fire, so the flames soared into the sky. From Tangqiao Town, only a red glow was visible. Before long, one of the empty ice storage rooms was completely burned down. The other one, due to its distance, was fortunately spared. The construction of the straw room was extensive, so the loss was also huge. The factory owner could only lament his misfortune.</p>
<p>Centuries-Old Tree Broken: Next to Tangqiao Road, south of Tangqiao Town Dam, there was a very large ancient tree that had been dead for a long time. It was about two or three arm spans in circumference and over thirty feet tall. It is said that the tree was one or two hundred years old. Its dead branches stood starkly. Last night, during the storm, a branch on the southwest side, about two and a half feet thick, was struck by lightning and fell to the ground, breaking into two pieces. Scattered rice husks were found inside the tree, but nothing else. After the incident, onlookers were amazed.</p>
<p>Mud Statues Vanished: Zhu Ahua's house, located south of Mubiao Bridge in the west of Tangqiao Road, consisted of a row of tile-roofed houses, including two side rooms and a main gate. In front was a garden with bamboo fences and a tall hedge on the west side. Last night, during the heavy rain, a corner of the roof above the main gate was struck by lightning, and several mud statues fell down. The people in the house were terrified and did not dare to go out to investigate until dawn. When they opened the door, the objects struck by lightning had vanished without a trace. This is also a strange occurrence.</p>
<p>World of Darkness: Tangqiao Town's main street is about three miles long. Most of the shops and residents have installed electric lights, supplied by the Zhangjiabang Company, which run continuously throughout the night. Around 7:00 PM last night, the main power line was struck by lightning in the air, interrupting the current and causing all the electric lights in Tangqiao Town to go out simultaneously, creating a world of darkness. The Third Division of the Third District of the town dispatched police to notify the head office, which immediately sent craftsmen to repair the line. After about an hour, the lights were restored.</p>
<h3>Lu Genrong Case</h3>
<p>Retrial Arguments Today</p>
<p>Yesterday's Arguments Concluded Were Rescinded</p>
<p>Huang Huiru's Reappearance Unconfirmed</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court has scheduled a retrial argument for the Lu Genrong case this afternoon (28th). The original trial judge, Zhao Zheng鏜, instructed Lu in court yesterday morning (27th) to rescind the previous conclusion of arguments. Regarding the rumor of Huang Huiru's reappearance in Suzhou, the High Court sent a special investigator after seeing it reported in today's newspaper and found it to be untrue.</p>
<h3>Female Workers Rushing Forward</h3>
<p>Over Twenty Fell into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Four or Five Missing</p>
<p>Four Dead Bodies Recovered</p>
<p>Workers at the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, located east of Dalianwan Road in Hudong, are divided into day and night shifts. Most of the female workers live in Pudong. The factory provides a ferry, the Yitong, which travels between Qichangzhan Pier in Pudong and Weisaigong Pier in Puxi (Hudong), for the female workers to travel to and from work for free. Female workers on the day shift board the ferry at Qichangzhan Pier in Pudong around 5:00 or 6:00 AM and disembark at the factory pier on the other side. The night shift does the same around 5:00 or 6:00 PM. This has been the routine. The day before yesterday, at 5:50 PM, the ferry was carrying over eighty female workers and was sailing towards the opposite bank. At the time, three foreign lighter boats and an empty pier boat were docked outside the factory pier. The ferry docked alongside the empty boat, and the female workers rushed to walk ashore via the empty boat and the foreign lighter boats. When they reached lighter boat No. 10232, owned by Wang Maolang, the boat became unstable due to the large number of people. About twenty lighter boat loads tumbled into the Huangpu River, along with about twenty female workers walking on the boat. The boatmen on the nearby boats and the sailors on the ferry rushed to rescue them. As a result, about four or five people went missing. The lighter boat were recovered with no losses. The factory sent people to search for the missing female workers. Around 10:00 AM yesterday, a body was found floating in the river next to the Ruirong Iron Factory. It was immediately recovered and sent to the Water Patrol Station. Half an hour later, another body was found floating near Huangpu Pier and was also taken to the Water Patrol Station. Chen Taotao, the factory's pier manager, reported to the police station that the first body was a fourteen-year-old woman from Ningbo, and the second body was a fifteen-year-old woman from Pudong. However, the names of the two bodies have not yet been determined, and their families are unknown. The factory stated that although the tragedy was caused by the victims rushing forward and capsizing the boat, the factory felt pity for them and was willing to provide a compensation of 150 yuan per person and purchase coffins for them. The police chief approved this and ordered his men to continue searching for the bodies to identify the families and allow them to claim the bodies.</p>
<h3>Father-in-Law Rapes Foster Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>Intends to Take Her as a Concubine</p>
<p>Great Turmoil in the Family</p>
<p>Wang Weigen, 40 years old, from Nanjing, currently residing at No. 55 Xinkang Lane, Route des Soeurs, Shanghai, runs a small business. His wife, Zhang, is also in her forties and has two sons, Douzi, 17, and Shuangzi, 13. Believing that her sons were grown, his wife Zhang, through a matchmaker in 1928, arranged a marriage for the eldest son, betrothing a Miss Zhou as his bride. For convenience and to save money, they adopted her as a foster daughter-in-law. The girl was quite beautiful, lively, and charming, and her mother-in-law liked her very much. At the time, she was only thirteen years old but looked like an adult. Unexpectedly, her father-in-law, Weigen, although old, was still very lustful. He became infatuated with the foster daughter's beauty and secretly raped her once in the middle of the night while everyone was asleep (俗謂扒灰</p>
<h3>News from Mogan Mountain Resort</h3>
<p>Mogan Mountain is a famous summer resort in the Southeast. Every summer, countless Chinese and foreigners go there to escape the heat. This year, due to the high cost of gold and the low value of silver, and increased fares for ship berths, the number of people going to Japan to escape the heat has decreased. Summer resorts in North China, such as Qingdao and Beidaihe, are inconvenient for travel due to the current situation. Therefore, the number of tourists to Mogan Mountain will surely increase compared to previous years. The automobile road from Hangzhou to Mogan Mountain has recently been completed. Passengers can get off the train at Hangzhou Station and take a car from the lakeside directly to the foot of the mountain, which only takes one and a half hours, saving six or seven hours compared to taking a steamer from Gongchen Bridge. It is said that many houses on Mogan Mountain have already been pre-rented, but the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has set up hotels on the mountain, which are very well-equipped and reasonably priced. It is reported that the Shanghai Bank and the China Travel Service have specially set up a summer office at 367 Wukang Road, Mogan Mountain, which is scheduled to open on July 1st.</p>

The association will send it as a gift. Last night, due to the extremely hot weather, the exhibition was extended by one hour to seven o'clock. It is said that the exhibition will only be held for today and tomorrow, and will not be extended. Tonight, because it is Saturday, it will be extended to 8 PM.

<h3>Anti-Epidemic Injections to the Poor</h3>
<p>Due to the hot weather, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Health Bureau is concerned that epidemics are bound to spread. In the shantytowns of Laobusheng Road and Xiaoshadu in western Shanghai, the huts are densely packed and everywhere, and they are mostly inhabited by poor people from Jiangbei. The small huts are particularly prone to epidemics. It is now specially scheduled to send personnel to these shantytowns on the 30th of this month to administer anti-epidemic injections to eliminate the plague.</p>

<p>Westerner Xu Debao</p>
<h3>The Gift Watch from the Mayor of London</h3>
<p>Was Stolen and Recovered</p>
<p>And Pleaded for His Servant</p>
<p>Xu Debao, a Westerner, is skilled in mechanics. He once received a commemorative watch worth a thousand gold from the Mayor of London in England as encouragement. Xu Debao cherished it and wore it constantly. Later, he came to Shanghai to serve as a mechanical engineer in the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade, and he brought the watch with him. The Westerner lived at No. 2 Zha Pu Road. At 3:00 PM on the 16th of this month, he discovered that the watch he cherished most in his life was missing. He immediately reported it to the Hongkou Police Department, which sent detectives to investigate. They suspected that Quan Tingbao, a Wenzhou native who was the Westerner's servant, was involved, so they detained Quan and interrogated him strictly. Quan finally confessed that he had stolen it and taken it to Nanjing with a friend. He would try to retrieve the original item. Now, it has been returned intact. Yesterday morning, the police department sent Quan to the Special District Court for investigation. Xu Debao, because the item had been returned to its original owner, went to the court and pleaded for leniency. Quan Tingbao confessed that he had taken the owner's item and lent it to a friend due to a moment of confusion, and that he did not intentionally steal it. After the trial, Judge Ge sentenced Quan Tingbao to 20 days of detention as a minor punishment.</p>
<p>Chen Deyu Files for</p>
<h3>Divorce Case Settled Out of Court</h3>
<p>Chen Deyu, a villager from Yangsi Township in Pudong, recently hired lawyer Qu Yue to sue his wife, Chen Gongshi, in the District Court, for taking her belongings and returning to Ningbo for a long time without returning home. He went to pick her up but to no avail, and had no choice but to file for divorce. His reasons were that the defendant often made excuses to return to Ningbo, and the plaintiff went to pick her up but could not find her. The defendant's actions were secretive, and people gossiped about her irregular behavior. She also secretly destroyed the hinges on the back of the suitcase and stole more than a dozen pieces of clothing left by the plaintiff's previous wife, Cai (Gongshi was a second marriage). A court hearing had been held, but the defendant did not appear. An order was issued for another summons. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Jinjian specially opened the First Court for a continued hearing. The defendant also hired lawyer Wu Luping to present her defense. After the judge took the seat, the defendant Chen Gongshi testified that she was 29 years old, named Yan Da, and married Chen Deyu as a second wife on the third day of the second month of the fifteenth year of the Republic through a matchmaker. The matchmakers were Li Amao and Zhou Qiuqiao. (Question) Were the husband and wife usually on good terms? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you go out? (Answer) If I did go out, I had to get permission from my mother-in-law before I could go out. I only went back to my mother's house. (Question) Where are you now? (Answer) At my mother's house. (Question) When did you return to Ningbo? (Answer) On the third day of the first month of last year, I first went to the former wife's mother's house (i.e., Cai Changsheng's house) to pay New Year's greetings. I stayed for a few days and returned home on the tenth day. Because my husband discovered that some clothes were missing and we had a quarrel, I went to tell my uncle, who told me to return to my mother's house temporarily. I do not want a divorce. Next, the witness Chen Yusheng testified that he was 62 years old, a Shanghai native who ran a tofu shop in Yangjiadu, Pudong. Chen Deyu is my cousin. Last year, my cousin's wife, Chen Gongshi, and Gong Yutang, Gongshi's father, came to my house and said that a quarrel had occurred because some clothes were missing. (Question) Did Chen Gongshi often return to her mother's house? (Answer) Not really. As for the clothes, Gongshi took them back to her mother's house, saying that she was going to alter them. (Question) Did your cousin Deyu know that Gongshi took the clothes? (Answer) Probably not. Sometimes Gongshi said that she was going to Cai's house, but Deyu went to look for her and could not find her. He returned to his wife's parents' house and still could not find Gongshi. Therefore, Deyu was quite unhappy. The witness Li Amao testified that he was 41 years old, a Shanghai native who lived in Yangsiqiao and worked in the rice industry, and was a friend of Chen Deyu. Gong was a relative. Zhou Qiuqiao testified that he was 29 years old, a Shanghai native who lived in Yangsiqiao and also worked in the rice industry. (Question) Why are they involved in litigation? Li and Zhou both answered that they did not know, but that the former was indeed a matchmaker. The official asked the plaintiff's lawyer if a settlement could be reached. Lawyer Qu rose and said that a settlement was possible, but there were some difficulties regarding the issue of alimony. The official (asked) plaintiff Chen Deyu, are you willing to settle? (Answer) I am willing to settle and separate from each other. The official asked the defendant Chen Gongshi, who said, "I don't want a divorce. I want to eat Chen's rice, or else pay me 30 yuan a month for living expenses until I am 60 years old." The official asked the plaintiff what he thought. The plaintiff replied, "I only earn 6 yuan a month in salary." The official ordered the two lawyers to go out and try to reach a settlement. If they did not succeed, another hearing would be scheduled. Then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wife Angered by Husband's Gambling</h3>

<p>Although Yan Xiushan Was Cunning, He Could Not Escape the Law</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, at the Hangan Wharf at the intersection of South Chang Road and Wai Ma Road in Wusong, a middle-aged man was seen walking back and forth near the wharf with a straw bag in his hand. Detectives Yu Peifa and Ling Zifa of the Public Security Bureau and a patrolman happened to pass by and noticed that the man's behavior was suspicious. They immediately stepped forward to question him. Unexpectedly, the man's face turned pale and he stammered. The detectives searched the man's entire body and found nothing. They then examined the straw bag and found thirty-six packages of red pills hidden inside. When the man saw that his plan had been exposed, he was initially stubborn. After the two detectives told him that they were from the Public Security Bureau, he bowed his head and had nothing to say. He was immediately taken to the Seventh District Office of the Public Security Bureau. After questioning by Section Member Xu, he confessed that his name was Yan Xiushan, 47 years old, from Chongming. The red pills were bought from a certain person in the French Concession of Shanghai and he intended to transport them to Chongming for sale. Because it was not easy to smuggle them through the Southern City due to the many detectives, he took a train to Songjiang this morning, thinking of taking a boat from Wusong. Little did he know that he would still be discovered by the detectives. He begged for forgiveness, etc. After verifying the confession, Section Member Xu immediately reported to District Chief Yang that the case involved the sale of red pills, and the man and the goods were sent to the Public Security Bureau for legal action at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Zhengtai Sand Boat</h3>
<p>The Shandong sand boat Bao Zhengtai was loaded with north-south goods from Shandong to Shanghai. A few days ago, when it sailed to the Yishan sea area, a hurricane broke out. It sailed to the seaside to shelter from the wind. The wind stopped the next morning and was about to set sail when two pirate ships suddenly approached. A large group of pirates with guns swarmed onto the boat and searched everywhere. They only found some scattered money. They then searched the owner's room and robbed him of six or seven hundred yuan, but they were still not satisfied. They searched all the partners on the boat, and none were spared. Two partners resisted and were shot and killed by the pirates. Before leaving, the pirates, fearing that the Bao boat would chase them, smashed the rudder of the boat so that it could not move. Fortunately, a sand boat towed the Bao boat to Liuhai and docked. The owner prepared coffins to collect the bodies of the two partners who were killed. He sent a friend to Shanghai to hire workers to repair the rudder so that the boat could sail to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Little Singing Girl Dies Under Wheels</h3>
<p>Chen Gendi, a girl from Suzhou, was only nine years old. Her parents died and she was alone and helpless. She followed people to learn little songs and opera scores, and sang in wine shops and teahouses to make a living. At 9:50 PM last night, she was walking on Edward Road at the Sanmaoge Bridge when she was hit by a No. 17994 car from the Global Automobile Company. Her head was bleeding profusely. A patrolman from the French Concession Police Department saw her and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment in the car. Because of her serious injuries, she died at 5:30 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Shirtless Loitering and Sleeping in the Open</h3>
<p>Due to the arrival of summer and the hot weather, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Director Yuan, noted that shop assistants and ignorant citizens of all industries in the city often like to go shirtless and loiter on the streets, or sleep in the open on the streets at night to cool off. This is detrimental to public appearance, hygiene, and morality. He has repeatedly issued clear orders to ban this practice, but it has not been completely eradicated. Therefore, he has re-emphasized the ban. In addition to notifying all districts, offices, and teams under his jurisdiction to comply, he must also inform the citizens in each district not to repeat the bad habits of going shirtless and sleeping in the open at night. If they do not comply, they will be punished to show deterrence.</p>
<h3>Temporary Establishment of Epidemic Hospital</h3>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a notice yesterday, which reads: "Notice is hereby given that cholera often occurs in this city in the summer, and once it spreads, it is extremely dangerous. Now that summer has arrived, this bureau is actively implementing preventive measures. If there are temporary epidemic hospitals established in the city, they should first report to the bureau for record, and receive the forms issued by the ministry, fill them out according to the format, and then permission will be granted for establishment. This notice is hereby given for general information."</p>
<h3>Preparations for Domestic Department Store</h3>
<p>Relocated to Former City Hall Office</p>
<p>Since receiving support from various parties, the China National United Department Store has been actively preparing for its opening in the shortest possible time. Yesterday, it began painting the storefront and installing white iron awnings and walls around the back commercial field (formerly the Iron House vegetable market). It also plans to solicit domestic advertisements for publicity. The method has been drafted by the Propaganda Section, and both partial and full advertisements can be handled by contacting the Propaganda Section. To facilitate office work, it has moved to the location on Nanjing Road (the former Municipal Government Library) since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Ship and Timber Industry Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Ship and Timber Industry Union held a general meeting of all members yesterday. Chairman Feng Daohang performed the rituals and discussed the following matters: (1) Recently, a letter was received from seven companies under the Guangdong Contractor (i.e., Jiyi Association) stating that they requested the branch to send representatives to the association for direct consultation on the issue of advance wage increases. Other conditions must be fulfilled after the Municipal Government Arbitration Committee makes a legal ruling. After Comrade Ye Yunping, a representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparation Committee, attended and offered patient advice to avoid losses for both parties, both parties were willing to compromise and reconcile. Therefore, the employers agreed to increase each worker's wage by 17 cents, and the remaining 3 cents would be paid when the wages of all parties were standardized. The labor and management representatives present signed a settlement agreement, which stipulated that from June 27, 1930, the wages of Guangdong ship and timber workers would be increased by 11 cents per worker, bringing the total to 1 yuan and 51 cents per worker. As for the remaining six cents (calculated per worker), it would be used as a fee to subsidize the union's labor undertakings. Because the issue of wage increases has already been resolved in advance, the chairman announced that work would resume uniformly this morning (June 27). The strike of the Second Branch has temporarily come to an end. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM.</p>
<h3>News of Seamen's Demand for Increased Wages</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Seamen's Industrial Union sent a letter to the consular corps stationed in Shanghai, stating: "Yesterday, we read in the Shanghai newspapers that your consular corps held a meeting on the 23rd to discuss the issue of increasing the wages of seamen on ships of various countries, and invited relevant groups to participate in the discussion. We were very pleased to learn about this. However, our union is the general group of Chinese seamen nationwide, and the number of seamen working on ships of various countries is very large. We were not notified of the meeting in advance, and we do not know how to handle it. Therefore, we are writing to inquire and request that you clearly inform us of the results of this discussion. If there is another meeting, please notify us in advance to attend and participate in the discussion. Please note that this letter has been translated and sent to the US Consul General in Shanghai for transmission. We believe that the consular corps will have a satisfactory reply."</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Expanding the Organization of the Zhabei Third Sub-Section</p>
<p>Abolishing the Wusong Third Sub-Section</p>
<p>The Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau has two branches under its jurisdiction: the Zhabei Branch and the Wusong Branch. The Zhabei Branch was established along the old system of the Songhu Police Department. Because the procedures for handling cases between the north and south cities and the concession areas were very complicated, a special branch was set up to be responsible for reviewing and trying cases sent by the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts and the Water Patrol Team. The Wusong Branch was the judicial section of the former Wusong Commercial Port Police Bureau. When the Public Security Bureau was completely reorganized in August 1927, the bureau was changed to the Seventh District and a section was set up under the Seventh District for its jurisdiction. Its original judicial section was changed to the Wusong Branch and placed under the supervision of the Third Section, specializing in the review and trial of cases sent by the entire Seventh District. It has been handling cases for many years. However, the commercial area in northern Shanghai is prosperous, and the number of cases sent by the districts and teams to the Zhabei Branch for investigation and handling has been increasing day by day. The original staff and clerks of the branch are overwhelmed. The Wusong Branch, located in a remote corner, handles less than one-tenth or two-tenths of the cases tried by the Zhabei Branch each month. It is learned that the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to plan as a whole, specially requested the Municipal Government to abolish the Wusong Branch from July 1 of this year and merge all cases into the Zhabei Branch for handling. The original staff and clerks will be transferred to the Zhabei Branch for office work.</p>

<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>Various Labor Unions in Zhabei: Shanghai China Foreign Del Telephone Company, disregarding our national sovereignty and without the consent of the Chinese directors, sold the special zone telephone business to an international company without authorization, acting perversely and abominably.

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the editor of Shen Bao: I am writing to inform you that the news in the local news column on the 22nd regarding Zhou Wanzhen's request for assistance from the Women's Association was a misunderstanding and not a fact. Wanzhen lives comfortably and safely in her uncle's house in Changzhou and has already terminated her marriage contract with the Shen family long ago. There is no such thing as coercion. This kind of false name action has damaged my personal reputation. I hereby send a letter to correct the facts and wish you peace. Zhou Wanzhen, June 27th</p>

<h3>Book by Han Zhishou</h3>
<p>Zou Yimei</p>
<p>Han Guojun Zhishou is a vigorous old man who is good at calligraphy and writing. In his later years, he is still healthy and sets a rule to sell his works, which are treasured by everyone. A guest talked about his anecdotes, saying that Zhishou responded to the children's examination in his early years and obtained the poem "Green, Green is Your Collar," but his family was poor and there was nothing more than Sima Xiangru's bare walls. He hired a certain Ms. as his wife. Ms. had the intention of not being a scholar, but she was bound by the marriage contract and could not renege. When the day was set for the wedding, the carriage was at the door, and the woman cried and refused to get in. Her parents and matchmakers persuaded her, but she did not listen. The woman had a younger sister who was two years younger, but she knew the great meaning and also shed tears to persuade her sister, saying, "Choosing a son-in-law lies in talent, not in wealth. If Mother insists on misunderstanding the auspicious ceremony, I will say it again and again." The sister could not bear it and scolded her angrily, "You love scholars. You can marry a scholar. Why are you talking nonsense?" When the younger sister heard this, her cheeks blushed at first, and then she resolutely said, "If my sister refuses to marry, I will definitely replace her, even if it is chaff and dregs." She got into the carriage and left, and the relatives and parties spread the news as strange. Indeed, she had an discerning eye for talents. Zhishou soon became prosperous and dedicated his strategies. Finally, he was honorably appointed as the Governor of Jiangsu Province and opened the government in Jinling. Although Zhishou's articles and economics were very different from the ordinary, the strength of his wife's encouragement was not without merit. When his wife died, Zhishou mourned endlessly. On the day of the funeral, the officials and subordinates all held the ropes and sent them off in plain cars and white horses, which was extremely grand for a while and was recorded in the annals of history. The wife was indeed worthy. Zhishou liked to browse literary publications. Yu edited the "Friends of Lianyi" and received a portrait from Zhishou. His solemn appearance made people respect him. He had it cast in bronze and published it to make Zhishou smile.</p>
<h3>Travel Jottings</h3>
<p>Xi Zai</p>
<p>A glimpse of what I saw in Bengbu: Bengbu's rise has only been for the past twenty or thirty years. Before that, it was just a small inland river port. Since the rise of the Jinpu Railway, it has jumped to become a major city in Anhui Province. The import and export goods from all over northern Anhui Province rely on this as the general transshipment hub. The prosperity of the market is not inferior to the two prefectures of Changzhou and Zhenjiang in Jiangnan. There is a movie park here and other new-style enterprises. The sails in the Huai River are like forests. To the west of the station, large hotels such as Jiaotong Villa can rival the third-class hotels in Shanghai. I am staying here for three days, and my neighbors are all singers and dancers. It is heard that there are nearly a thousand brothels here, each paying a flower donation of eight to twelve yuan per month for the Yangzhou class and the Huaiqing class. The Public Security Bureau relies on this as a major source of income, so although the sound of banning prostitution is high in other places, it is difficult to implement here. This is because our travelers need to pay a public security donation of eight cents every day. In addition to the hotel industry, restaurants and bathhouses are said to have this donation item, so the director of the Bengbu Public Security Bureau is one of the most important positions in Anhui Province.</p>
<p>Jiaotong Villa in Bengbu is like the Garden Hotel in Xuzhou, both of which are the top new-style hotels in the area. The price of each room</p>
<p>The smallest republic in the world, Xin Gui</p>
<p>The recently established Republic of San Marino is located in Italy, covering an area of thirty-eight square miles and a population of only fifteen thousand. It is indeed the smallest republic in the world. What is even more peculiar is that the country currently elects two presidents and sixty members of parliament, two of whom are the main leaders, with a term of six months. This is also a unique aspect of the republic.</p>
<p>The accommodation fee ranges from two yuan to four or five yuan, and the layout is still clean. It is a pity that there is a maximum level of greed, that is, bedding must be rented separately, each item ranging from one dime to three dimes. Adding up small accounts is expensive. If the rented item is a silk quilt, it can be purchased at the end of the second year, and a simple house can be built. That is, a silk quilt costs three dimes and three cents a day. We southerners rarely bring bedding with us when traveling like northerners. Such places are very uneconomical, and the same is true everywhere north of Nanjing. It is difficult to understand why merchants in northern cities are so stubborn in their thinking. Other facilities have been imitated in the Shanghai style, but this one thing must maintain the legacy of the mule car transportation era and refuse to give travelers a little convenience. It is also strange.</p>
<p>Revisiting Xuzhou: This is the third time I have come to Xuzhou this year. I have previously recorded some trivial matters in Xuzhou and submitted them to this newspaper. At this time, I am in the midst of military chaos. There is nothing but gray comrades coming and going in the streets, but the citizens here are used to it and there is no panic. However, the theater has long been closed because it cannot stand the visit of the eight grandfathers. It is 720 miles from Pukou to here. The construction of the Jinpu Railway south of here was designed by British engineers, so the platforms of each station are more solid and durable. The construction north of here was designed by German engineers, who focused on aesthetics in addition to solidity. The construction of the station buildings showed ingenuity, and the colors were very colorful and the forms were extremely varied. Even the slightest stone must be paved into a pattern that fits the art. The Jinan Station best represents this beautiful building.</p>
<p>Yunlong Mountain is located two miles south of the city. The mountain range is winding like a dragon's tail, and the Pan Stone Dog Lake occupies the city. In the past, there were colorful clouds, so it was called Yunlong Mountain. Together with Zifang Mountain, it is one of the two major scenic spots in Xucheng. There is also Jiuli Mountain, where Han Qi Wang ambushed ten times, which is slightly far from Xucheng, so I did not go.</p>
<h3>The Grand Graduation Ceremony of Zhihua in the Plum Rain</h3>
<p>Liang</p>
<p>The Zhihua Obstetrics School in Suzhou has been established for five years. The third and fourth graduation ceremonies were held at the YMCA. Principal Wu Qisun reported that this year, in accordance with the regulations issued by the Ministry, the course of study was changed to two years, so the third and fourth grades graduated at the same time. In addition to the usual etiquette, there were four extra performances: one was the song and dance "Butterfly Girl," one was the Peking Opera "Picking Up Gold," one was the beauty play "The Eternal Silence," and one was the song and dance "Rose Fairy." It is said that the rehearsal only took a week, but it was surprisingly moving and quite difficult. The continuous plum rain was extremely depressing, but listening to the clear songs and watching the wonderful dances made people feel refreshed. Those who came in the rain were in an endless stream. Those who arrived late could not get seats and stood without saying a word. From this, we know that there are many people who share the same feelings as Yu.</p>
<p>The most rare thing that day was the presence of Hui Gengsheng to give certificates. Hui is the beauty and the head of the Gengsheng Hospital who came to China thirty-five years ago. Now he is old and his hands and feet are numb, so he has declined to treat patients. Gu Zhihua, a female doctor, is Hui's proud student. This time, he staggered and came to give earnest words of encouragement. His white hair and rosy complexion were full of love, which was a good story for a time.</p>
<h3>Archaeological Record of Xianli Mound</h3>
<p>Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>A mound in Five Mile Lake, like a snail's bun embracing blue, emerging from the water, is called Xianli Mound, commonly known as Fairy Mound, one of the ancient monuments of Xidi. It is named after Fan Li and Xi Shi passing by and mooring their boats here, so Five Mile Lake is also named Li Lake, which is also a story of love. However, there are two theories about the ending of Xi Shi. According to the Ben Zhuan of Wu Yue Chunqiu, Tao Zhu</p>
<h3>Travels in Nanyang (38)</h3>
<p>On the sixth day, a friend invited me to have dinner at Lotte Garden. The dishes in this garden are quite good, and the price of 1.2 yuan per person is not too expensive. However, because I often eat Soto, I eat vegetarian noodles in various places, and the price is from 2 jiao to 3 jiao per bowl, mostly in Cantonese stores, and the language is not understood, so sometimes there are misunderstandings. I usually have lunch at a cake shop run by Jining people instead of a Chinese restaurant. Their egg pancakes are very good, costing 1 jiao per piece. I eat them every day, eating three or four pieces, accompanied by iced milk, which is very good, costing 4 or 5 jiao per meal. But what is strange is that I still don't know what the Jining people call cakes, nor do I know how much each cake costs. However, I give them whatever price they ask. Language barriers between ethnic groups are like this. The Jining people eat by grabbing rice with their hands instead of using chopsticks. After eating, they wash their hands with water. I have also heard that they use their right hand to grab food and their left hand to wipe their bowels, which is impossible for us to do. I eat at the same table with them, and they also have knives and forks available for my use. We don't interfere with each other and just pay the money. I don't know the names and prices of each dish. After several months, it is still impossible to explain it, which is also laughable. However, the taste of their cakes and dishes is common here. Most of the drinks served to guests here are coffee mixed with milk and sugar, which tastes quite good, costing 1 jiao per cup. What I hate the most is the small tea cup, which is the size of a Fujian-style wine cup. If you are thirsty and encounter this thing to entertain guests, it is really unfortunate.</p>
<p>On the seventh day, I received a letter and a book of poems from Xiong Changqing, the president of the Guangdong Jingwu Association. He wanted to meet me in Guangdong, but because the trip was too rushed, I came directly to the south without delay. His gift of poems to me said, "I read his poems and his books, knowing that he is a genius and not an ordinary person." His praise can be said to be extreme. Xiong is a strange man, a Jinshi in the late Qing Dynasty, who once served as a consultant to Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He traveled around the world and raised as many as thirty or forty beloved concubines. This year, he is in his seventies. A few years ago, he led his concubines to compete in martial arts in Japan and returned victorious. He is able to write poems with Zen meaning. His concubines are all proficient in martial arts and learn handicrafts, taking classes in shifts at home without being idle. It is like a variant of a female school. Generally, people in Fujian and Guangdong mainly engage in business and see political life as very low and tasteless, so their doors are written with the words "Rich Guest Arrives," which is different from the northerners who must call "Noble Guest." This can be seen in their customs and customs. Because they admire wealth, they use more females to protect it, which has become extremely popular. Wealthy merchants in Nanyang definitely do not only operate in one port. It is common for branches to reach more than ten ports, and there are villas and concubines everywhere. It is common for wealthy people to have three, four, five, or six concubines. The most common is the famous Sugar King Huang Zhonghan, who has 40 million assets and more than fifty concubines in Semerang, Dutch East Indies. He is now dead. Because they admire wealth, they value familyism. This is the origin of the saying "More Longevity, More Wealth, More Sons." Because they want more sons, they set up more concubines, which leads to a distorted society in China. People only know about the family and are extremely indifferent to social undertakings. This is because they love their family too much. The story of Duke Mu's three moves to become famous does not mention Xizi. Mozi said, "[Xishi's sinking is beautiful]." This means that Xishi was sunk by Yue, which means that the poet Sui Yuan's sentence "[Xishi will be sunk in the Wu swamp]." The meaning of the sentence is that Xishi was settled by Yue, that is, with Duke Mu. There is only one saying that Xi Shi followed Fan Li, which only began with Du Mu's sentence "[Xi Shi went to Suzhou, and a boat chased after the Chiyi]." Yang Shen'an's collection in Ming Dynasty believed that the Yipian of Wu Yue Chunqiu said that after the fall of Wu, Yue floated Xi Shi in the river, and now he ends with Chiyi. Du Mu's sentence is based on this, but it is actually a misunderstanding. After Wu was destroyed, Xi Shi was settled in the river. Those who followed Chiyi had a strong influence on Zixu's death. The death of Xu was filled with Chiyi. Now Shen Xi Shi is so loyal to reporting Zixu. Du Mu mistakenly regarded Zixu's Chiyi as Fan Li's Chiyi. However, I have many doubts about this theory. Xi Shi is a Yue person and was instructed by Shao Bo to enter Wu. Wu then became a swamp, which was a sinner of Wu and a meritorious minister of Yue. With a weak woman, she did not hesitate to sacrifice herself to avenge her homeland and complete her master's hegemony. On the merits of the award, she could also cast gold with Fan Li. And without Xi Shi, Zixu would not die. If Xu did not die, Wu would not be destroyed, and Yue would not be protected. Now Shen is reporting Zixu's loyalty. Xu is loyal to himself, so is Xi Shi not loyal? Why is Yue's reward and punishment upside down and right and wrong are not distinguished? Can the lord of black beak and long neck use his archery and cooking dog to the extent of a woman without hesitating to do this burning piano to make a crane? Otherwise, the two of them are both peerless beauties and heroes of the world. They are naturally a good match and have become confidants. The plan to live together forever should have been decided when they did not enter the Wu Palace. After success, the clouds and waters are vast, and for thousands of years, the Five Lakes are suspicious of immortals and hidden. Why should future generations argue for it, causing the beauty to have a sense of injustice that cannot be explained, and making those who love ancient times unhappy? I passed this mound the other day and wrote a poem about the past: "What is lucky about the lonely mound is also a thousand years, a small mooring is actually a victory. The hero only deserves to suffer together, and the beauty is specially allowed to share the kindness and hatred. The smoke and water of the Five Lakes are a dream of three lives, and the 20 years of meritorious service are a leaf boat. The floating house should not be ashamed of me, but taught to stir up the middle stream]." This is also from Du's saying.</p>
<h3>Sea Entertainment Talk</h3>
<p>Xiu</p>
<p>Although the sea is known for its prosperity in the whole country, the entertainment methods of ordinary people are nothing more than prostitution and gambling. Those who do not prostitute or gamble and seek legitimate entertainment in their spare time often find it difficult to find their way. One day, I passed the Meinanfang on Jing'an Temple Road in the late afternoon, the doctor's residence of my friend Dr. Zhuang De. Dr. had finished his clinic and was sitting down to rest. Therefore, we talked about entertainment. Dr. said that I am busy with patients all day long, and there is little time to spare except for sleep for twenty-four hours a day, so there is no entertainment. However, I must ride a horse to the suburbs to control the situation in the early morning for fun. Every Friday night, I must gather a few friends from the Kunqu opera community to dine and enjoy the songs together, drinking lightly and singing softly, which is very happy. It often ends late at night. These two things can be said to be my entertainment methods. Dr. first studied medicine at the Tiancizhuang Boxing Hospital in Suzhou for several years. After practicing, he became richer day by day. After returning from studying in Germany, his learning improved day by day. He repeatedly treated difficult and complicated diseases, and treated countless people. Last winter, Ms. Gao Huang Zhaiying in Lingnan suffered from crane's knee wind, and the doctor did not perform surgery on her, but applied acupuncture and electricity to heal her. The lady has been promoting her ever since, and the patients are fighting to gather at her door, and the doctor is getting busier and busier. At first, I didn't expect that in the midst of his busy schedule, he had such a leisurely mood.</p>

<p>(6) Economic Welfare Facilities: Economic welfare facilities are public facilities designed to improve the economic welfare of citizens. The locations of these facilities include five categories: (1) Public pawnshops, similar to Chinese pawnshops, but charging lower interest rates than ordinary for-profit pawnshops. The interest rate is approximately 1.25% per month per yuan. There are eleven municipal pawnshops. (2) Simple lodging facilities, specifically for laborers who cannot afford to rent houses. The daily rate is only 20 sen per person, equivalent to 2 jiao of Japanese yen. There are five municipal lodging facilities. (3) Public canteens, providing meals for laborers. People of other occupations also dine there. There are fifteen municipal canteens. (4) Municipal housing, approximately 1,400 units, with extremely low rent, specifically for citizens who serve the city but have very low monthly salaries. The Social Bureau has a dedicated house and room rental agency to manage housing referrals. (5) Public bathhouses: There are three municipal bathhouses. The fee for laborers is extremely low, only 3 sen per bath, equivalent to 3 fen of Japanese yen.</p>
<p>(7) Tokyo Municipal Nursery: The organization of the Japanese nursery is similar to the current relief homes in China. Initially, during the fifth year of the Meiji era, it only accepted beggars from the city, with a very limited scope. After more than fifty years of expansion, it now provides relief to the poor, traveling patients, abandoned infants, orphans, and wayward children, as well as moral reform for juvenile delinquents. The results have been increasingly excellent, making it a major cornerstone of social services in Tokyo. The nursery primarily houses elderly and disabled individuals. It has the Sugamo branch as an infant care home, the Itabashi branch as a lung hospital, and the Awa branch as a coastal residence. It also has the O-kubo Hospital, Tsukiji Hospital and Hiroo Hospital, all of which are places for poor citizens to seek medical treatment. It is divided into three categories: (1) Free medical care; (2) A consultation fee of 64 sen per visit, equivalent to 6 jiao 4 fen in Japanese yen; and (3) A consultation fee of 1.24 yuan. The fee payment is determined based on the financial situation of the visiting citizen. Unless extremely poor, few are willing to be categorized as receiving free medical care. There is also a sanatorium for lung diseases, a hygiene testing laboratory, and the Tokinokashira School (a reformatory for juvenile delinquents), etc., all on a large scale. The director, Viscount Eiichi Shibusawa, has been in office since the seventh year of the Meiji era, dedicated to the work with a vigorous spirit, which is why he has been able to achieve continuous progress.</p>

<p>Gold Market Plunges</p>
<p>Breaks Through the 600 Taels Barrier</p>
<p>A Drastic Drop of 17.1 Taels</p>
<p>The market sentiment worsened, gradually declining. Yesterday, the drop in the gold price was extremely sharp, suddenly breaking through the 600 tael barrier. The storm was unstoppable, with fluctuations of three or four taels at times, but the decline was quite rapid, causing widespread panic. This was primarily due to rumors of easing exchange rates and news of political incidents abroad, which led to heavy selling by long positions, reversing the previous rally. Exchange rates had already increased by half a level, and internal pressures were also evident. Major players in the market, such as Fuchang, Chengfengyong, Yuansheng, and Xinheng, were aggressively selling, while buyers included Wanxing, Shunli, and Hengxing. The early market saw a contraction in the large bar spread, leading to a high opening. Subsequently, market sentiment worsened, and environmental pressures caused a gradual decline, almost plummeting. After a drastic drop of over 10 taels, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Yongfeng, Taixing, Fuyu, and others leaned towards selling foreign exchange, further weakening the market. The turbulent storm caused a shocking plunge of over 10 taels, suddenly reaching below 596 taels, allowing those in short positions to avert danger. The final price settled at 596 taels and zero, but the day's fluctuation of 20 taels was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>The large bar spread contracted, leading to a high opening. Yesterday, silver bars were slightly lower by 1/16, but the opening price for August American silver was 2.2 sen higher at 615.5 taels. The gross spread reached 15.9 sen, then fluctuated by 2 sen before seller activity lowered it by 3-4 sen. The first forward payment was already long by $1.25 USD plus 375 sen Japanese yen, decreasing by 75, and eventually plummeted to 611.12 sen. It then increased to 12.45 sen. Due to the easing of exchange rates, the six pence for the current month's forward payment could be used for trading, and the poor market sentiment broke through the 610 tael barrier with a sharp drop of 5.10 sen, reaching 607.2 sen. Suddenly, it climbed back up 3 sen to 610.03 sen. Later, because Wahbi bought 8 English gold at 6 pence, 18.75 standard gold bought September 25th, the gold price fell 6 sen and 11 points to 603.7 sen. The selling pressure from major players remained strong. Then, the Zhengjin Bank absorbed 6 pence, 18.75 English gold for September, and also advanced 1.3 sen and 6 fen in Dalian, so it turned peaceful, adding 4 sen in total. Speculative purchases at noon were 7 sen 8-9, and by closing it was 7 sen 2. The posted price had been changed to 669 taels, a decrease of 61-62 taels.</p>
<p>The situation was dangerous. After breaking through the barrier, the after-market opened at 606.5 taels and soon declined rapidly. After 3 o'clock, it suddenly broke through the 600 tael barrier, with fluctuations of only 2 taels. Fuchang, Yongfeng, Yuanchengyong, Taixing, and others sold heavily. Exchange rates also tightened, and the unstable situation caused widespread panic. At 3:30, it reached 598.1 sen. Subsequently, there were slight purchases, and Hengxing also purchased heavily, with over 2 taels already on the table, totaling 600.005 sen. At 4 o'clock, a great storm arose, and the waves were turbulent. Sellers did not stop, and suddenly another 4-5 taels were shed, plummeting to 595.5 sen at 4:20. However, the various exchange rates did not show any special changes and were slightly looser. At 4:30 closing, it was 596.2 sen. In the after-market, it traded around 97, a huge drop of 17.1 sen compared to the previous day, but the rebound was very strong. The maximum price for the day was 615.9 sen, and the minimum price was 595.6 sen, a difference of 20.4 sen. The early market for goods opened at 15.1 sen, noon closed at 06 sen, afternoon 06.4 sen, and the closing price was 597. The posted price was reduced by 62-63 taels to 73 taels. Registration was held twice in the afternoon. The pre-market price for July was 605 taels and August 07 taels. The post-market price for July was 598 taels and August 600 taels, with a water supplement of 05 taels. In the afternoon, 98 taels. The market will be closed for two days next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday due to the bank's summer vacation.</p>
<p>Heavy Selling Pressure Was Everywhere. Major players, including Fuchang, Yuanchengyong, Yuancheng, Yuanxingyong, Chengfengyong, Xinheng, and Tianxiang, were all actively selling. Senchangyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Yud, Hengxing, Changshengyong, and speculators were buying. In the afternoon, Hengxing and Wanxing bought, while Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, Taixing, Fuyu, Yuancheng, and others sold. The Dalian group bought over 2,000 bars and sold over 500 bars. The Guangdong group continued to buy over 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Ease Both Officially and Unofficially</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Sold Over One Million Yuan in Dalian</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's official foreign exchange rates increased by half a level. The English exchange rate decreased by 1.25 to 1 shilling 5 pence, 625 USD plus 375 totaled 35 yuan 75, Indian added 75 totaled 98 rupees 75, German added 1 yuan totaled 149 marks 5 francs added 6 yuan totaled 908 yuan, Japanese yen added half a yuan totaled 88 shields 5, Hong Kong added 5 sen totaled 86 taels and a half, Singapore decreased 1 tael totaled 157 taels 75, Japanese yen decreased 75 sen totaled 1 tael 3 sen 8 fen 75. The trend in the internal market was quite weak, with relative calm in the early market, weakness at noon, and even greater weakness in the afternoon, as the gold market plummeted. The sudden break through the 600 tael barrier was due to heavy selling by major players and a lack of confidence. Most of the selling was done by Chinese merchants, with over 300,000 pounds sterling traded and over 200,000 pounds sterling sold. The banks' appetite was considerable, with Zhengjin Bank, HSBC, MacEwen, Wahbi, Sumitomo, and Holland all absorbing. The various banks traded 100,000 pounds sterling among themselves, and also traded 100,000 USD. Chinese merchants also sold current Dalian exchange notes totaling over one million yuan. Zhengjin Bank, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and others all had buying interest. The final result was that the price compared to the previous day was 375 longer for shillings, 5625 longer for US dollars, and 2 fen shorter for Japanese yen, and the market sentiment suddenly became weaker.</p>

<h3>The Foreign Market Is Especially Active Due to Securities Settlement</h3>
<p>The Foreign Tael Rises to 7 Sen 2 Fen 5 Li in the Morning</p>
<p>The overall situation of the market is that the foreign currency trading in recent days is booming due to the smooth flow of transactions, and the market sentiment is not weak. Yesterday was the date for the end-of-month settlement of various securities, so the inflow and outflow were particularly large, and the amount of deficiencies was also quite far apart. The procedures were quite tedious, so the market price of foreign taels was high in the morning. It is appropriate that the noon market fell back. As for the guest side, Yuan currency has a wide range of uses, so adding water is also increasing daily, and the same is true for new currency.</p>
<p>Remittance Price (Foreign Tael) The market suddenly opened at 7 sen 2 fen 5 li in the morning, which is the highest price this year. The noon market was slightly flat, and the transaction was still booming. The price was reduced by half a li to 7 sen 2 fen 4 li. (Silver Remittance) 1 fen 2 in the morning, 1 fen at noon, the situation is the same as the previous day. The bank quoted 5 points, the heading still has no added water, and no one wants the white heading.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Situation The Jiangnan small foreign currency market is idle, and the price is slightly lower than the previous day by 1 li, which is 6 sen 3 fen 5 li. The same is true for both the morning and noon markets, and no transactions were made in the two markets. The Guangdong small foreign currency was 6 sen 00 half li in the morning and 6 sen 01 li and a half at noon, and the result was 1 li 3 hao 7 half higher than the noon market of the previous day. Fourteen thousand five hundred jiao were traded in the morning and nine thousand five hundred jiao in the afternoon. The copper coin market suddenly shrunk by four thousand to three hundred and ninety-three thousand wen. It is said that a large batch of Dalian help was loaded out.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars (Silver Currency) Yesterday, the bank's collections and settlements were still the same, but the settlements were more. Chinese merchants collected and settled bills of 22-30,000,000, foreign merchants over 2,000,000. Various taxes and miscellaneous collections were 9,890,000. 6,000,000 was settled and 1,000,000 was advanced. 1,600,000 was taken out of the warehouse and 800,000 was entered.

Paper money only 32,000 in the afternoon, Zhongshan new currency 50,000. Extramural paper money 175,000 in the morning and 112,000 in the afternoon.

Early morning inter-market trading by banks 500,000 and 450,000 at noon and over 800,000 in additional transactions. The amount of bonds settled on the day reached over 8,000,000.

<p>Yarn and Cotton Foreign Yarn and Cotton Rebounds, Chinese Yarn</p>
<p>The Tragedy Is Gone... The Vitality Is Active</p>
<p>The rebound in the yarn market was sudden and good, because the overseas cotton yarn market conditions rebounded unanimously, and people's hearts were moved by it, causing profit-takers to buy in to resist the empty, but new buyers are still lacking. Only the average retail customer in the market has a slightly better mindset and needs to see a rise of one or two more taels. What is regrettable is that actual sales are unusually sluggish, and the underlying goods are increasing daily. The fundamental problem needs to shift to actual needs.</p>
<p>In recent months, the yarn has rebounded weakly by three taels. Before the human standard market opened, both Indian and American cotton rose, and the people in the market turned firm. Each month rose by one tael, and the outer two or three plates remained firm. The three-piece yarn rose by six or seven yuan. As a result, each rose by nine cents to one tael and five cents. The last day of the month was in the afternoon, and the short position was slightly lacking, and it suddenly rose by two taels. However, there were still many sellers in the distant month, and they only rose by one, two, three, four, and five cents. It was found that the entire day's sales were 550 to 2,350 bales from Lichang, Yiyu, Yicheng, Xincheng, Yuda, Maoji, and Shenyu. Hankou, Tianlong, Rongxing, Gengfeng, Hengde, and Shenji bought 450 to 1,250 bales. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 30,850 bales. The left side of the human standard closing price is recorded.</p>

<p>Current Sales Are As Sparse As Ever The current yarn sales route is still clear. Statistics for all gangs buying the whole day were 726 bales. 400 bales were purchased in the same industry. The most customers and inland buyers purchased 305 bales. In addition, 100 bales were imported to the inland, 55 bales to Sichuan, 36 bales to Yunnan, 50 bales to Qinhuangdao, 35 bales to Nanyang, 25 bales to Xuzhou, and 120 bales to miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Is Moving Forward</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose again and the situation was slightly firm. The hearts of the people were moved by the rebound of Indian cotton by 8 to 12 rupees. The Han gang made large batches of short positions, but current cotton transactions were still quiet. The general trend of the cotton market is still difficult to rise sharply. However, the change of five or six sen is not surprising at present.</p>
<p>The Hankou Gang Fills the Shorts in the Biao Yarn In the market before the Hankou Biao market opened, there were fewer sellers in the market and more people taking empty positions. Each month rose by three or four sen. In the afternoon, due to the strong yarn market, each month rose by five fen to one sen. Maoji, Hengyi, Tianchang, Taixing, Fuhe, and Changfeng bought 700 dan to 1,300 dan. Minghua, Fuhe, Yicheng, Lichang, Yuanda, Shenxin, and Yuda sold 900 dan to 1,300 dan. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 34,400 dan. The left side of the Hankou Biao closing price is recorded.</p>

<h3>The World's Cotton Yarn Rose Unanimously</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Was Purchased by Japanese Merchants Yesterday, American cotton was strong due to poor weather and lack of strong sellers on Wall Street. The futures rose by 35 to 37 pounds. The spot price rose by 35 pounds. English cotton futures rose by 112 points. Spot prices rose by 17 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points.

<p>Grain Prices Rebounded Rapidly</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Rose Many Floating Up... Factories Stopped Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market price of each month suddenly showed a sharp rise. The quotation for foreign wheat rebounded by 8, 9 jiao and a huge amount of 1 yuan, which made the floating more active and the factory’s selling also stopped at the same time. The market then rose step by step. In the end, the factory conclusion was that the rice price was not cheap, and the inland gang's thinking was still strong and unusual. The current market value is already higher than the highest price of the previous week by 1 qian. The speculative bulls seem to think it is an excellent opportunity. The rapid speed of the rebound can be seen in general. As a result, the current month rebounded by 3/25 of a li compared to the previous day. July rose by 3/25 of a li. August rose by 3/9 of a li. September rose by 3/75 of a li. October rose by 3/11 of a li. November rose by 3/2 li.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Rebounded in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Delivery Volume This Month Is About 10 Cars</p>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat showed an initial flat and then firm trend. Trading was very quiet in the morning, and the near term was calm. However, October and November showed a rising trend. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the rise in flour was firm and the price of foreign wheat was generally clear, so although trading in each month was not smooth, the market was already bullish. As a result, July, August, and November rebounded by 3/5 of a li compared to the previous day. September and October each rose by 5 sen. The delivery volume this month was about 10 cars, mostly yellow buckwheat delivered by the Jiangbei gang, which was received by factories in this port. Spot wheat prices continued the decline of the previous day, and each grade fell by 4 or 5 sen. Shaoxing wheat opened at 4 taels 7 qian 7 fen, Shashi wheat at 4 taels 8 qian, Yangzhou wheat at 4 taels 7 qian 7 fen, Gaoyou wheat at 4 taels 7 qian 3 fen, Shaobo wheat at 4 taels 8 qian 2 fen, Maishu ginseng at 4 taels 9 qian, and Qingjiangpu wheat at 4 taels 8 qian half. A total of over 5,000 bags were opened. Old car wheat was 5 taels 1 qian 9 fen, and the next was 5 taels 1 qian 1 fen, totaling 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Were Weak and Exhausted</h3>
<p>Annamite Rice New Arrival Price Opened at 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, two ships of foreign rice arrived with the guests, and because they were watching, there were few transactions, and the price fell by 1 or 2 jiao. More will continue to arrive on the market or may be temporarily settled. Tongshi opened 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon at a price of 18 yuan 9 jiao half to 18 yuan 7 jiao half, 3,000 bags of small twisted at a price of 17 yuan 7 jiao to 17 yuan half, 2,000 bags of large twisted at a price of 17 yuan 1 jiao to 16 yuan 9 jiao half, 1,500 bags of Min party at a price of 18 yuan 3 jiao to 18 yuan, and 500 bags of Kegai rice at a price of 17 yuan 9 jiao half. Annam is more similar to Du japonica and is quite popular in this street. A small batch of newly arrived rice followed the market to open 1,000 bags at a price of 20 yuan, and 200 bags of European rice at a price of 18 yuan 7 jiao 6 fen. 7,800 bags of brown rice and road goods also followed a small 1 or 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market Remained Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Transactions Remained Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, no ships arrived in Chuanyan from Henans, and the registered rice boats and passengers did not return. They insisted on the cost and refused to open the warehouse by force, but the store was difficult to decide quickly, so they changed their plans to import foreign rice to meet the retail sales of the store. Some of the big stores even had rumors of buying directly from the inland producing areas, but the small stores seemed to find it slightly inconvenient to trade in cash and hoped to resolve the situation as soon as possible. But it has become a stalemate, and all-day transactions remain suspended.</p>
<p>No arrivals have been made at the Hunan River from the north for several days. Each producing area on the south and west roads has viewed the changes in the gate as before, so the source has stopped. At the moment, all transactions are in foreign rice, so the Saigon small twist in the Association is selling very well and the price is soaring. The opportunity for Papa to arrive in China is excellent.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Peacefully and Smoothly. Large Gangs American Sales Continue to Be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the teahouses, Huzhou Pinghui, and the large gangs, EWO, Jardine, and the Chinese Tea Company in Shanghai, continued to search for and handle transactions that were not silent. The selling price did not change compared to the opening. The road houses, Gao Zhuang, Zhenmei, Baochang, Dude Yongxing, etc. also had a stomach of needle eyebrows. Both the show eyebrows transactions tended to be smooth, but the selling price was very resistant to the current market, and the key was still the unsalable Zhenmei in the medium and low villages. According to the English teahouse, there are still 5</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Summer Market Sales Become Quiet</h3>
<p>The piece goods trade has been quiet recently, largely because prices have already risen sufficiently. Local customers' needs have turned sluggish. The Tianjin group has suspended operations due to tax issues. Furthermore, with the arrival of hot summer weather, gatherings are sparse. Yesterday's sales decreased significantly. However, the gray Guangxi goods from the East are selling well due to low inventories. The Changsha and Hankou groups are both replenishing stock. Zijinshan is selling for 4.9 taels, Shuang Deli and Kewai Meiren for 4.875 taels, with over 50 pieces transacted. Fine broadcloth has fallen slightly compared to before. Huxin Ting was sold yesterday for 2.525 yuan, Ding Facai for 2.5 yuan. Bao Qiu blue-gray, with 25 pieces arriving yesterday, is offered at 2.925 yuan. Cotton fabrics from Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and other ports remain active. Fuhua bright red is priced at 1.95 yuan, Niaomeiren Yanglan at 1.95 yuan, Fuhua Fei Fa at 1.85 yuan. Camel stripes are being purchased, also priced at 1.95 yuan. Among Western goods, the 1.6-yuan grade is the strongest, with a tendency to rise. Gongping Tianci gold is sold at 6.75 yuan, Gongping Liu Hai at 8 yuan. Taihe Dangren Bei is offered at 8.75 yuan. Changsheng Dian is offered at 1.1 tael, a price that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>New Silver Dollar Market Remains Strong</p>
<p>New silver dollars, ranging from 2.2 to 2.35 yuan, have been in high demand recently due to purchases by construction groups, leading to a supply shortage in the market. Standard silver is also rising steadily due to favorable circumstances. The current market price is 6.25 taels per load, with single transactions requiring no less than 6.6 or 6.7 taels. It is said that hoarding by speculators has been intense in recent days, making circulating goods increasingly scarce. Sentiment is very positive, and prices are becoming increasingly sharp. Consequently, asking prices have reached 7 taels. However, whether this will be sustained depends on actual business.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market news from the production area indicated that the current price of Cuban sugar is 1.3125, a slight increase of 0.0625 compared to the previous report. The price of New York futures sugar for September is 1.39, for December 1.49, for March next year 1.575, and for May 1.64, each up by 0.02. The current price of Java sugar is 8.75, a decrease of 0.125. The price of futures sugar for July is 8.625, and for August 8.50, with no rise or fall. The market at the guild was weak, with little buying interest in Dutch sugar No. 24 raw white. However, shipments seemed active. An asking price of 7.85 taels attracted no inquiries. A few buyers bid 7.75 taels, but the bid was rejected. Ultimately, there was a slight transaction at 7.8 taels. The market for No. 20 medium white at 7.7 taels was also unremarkable. Imports and exports of Japanese sugar were also slack. The price of Meiji YRO mark was 8.05 taels, Minghua lacked YT mark 8.275 to 8.2625 taels, YP mark 8.45 taels. Demand was also quiet, showing signs of decline. Only the Binghua Qing grade was offered in a lot of over 200 bags, priced at 7.8 yuan, with separate clearing dates within 5 and 15 days, resulting in a flat market.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Limited Supply of Wood Ear Fungus</h3>
<p>Since the new crop of wood ear fungus came out, the limited arrivals due to transportation disruptions have led to frequent price increases. According to a report from Hankou, the price is 117 taels, with the tight supply expected to keep prices high. The price for processing and shipping to Shanghai is already close to 130 taels, making it difficult to find cheap goods here. As for northern fungus, the actual situation of the new crop is unknown, and Niuzhuang and other places are instead purchasing supplies from Shanghai for resale. The future market situation will depend on the supply.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Three</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<p>Plain Stationery by Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>By Ms. Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>Stories in the style of letters are a new development in China's weak literary garden, like a diligent gardener cultivating a flower that is easy to grow. As long as one can work hard to irrigate it, a good harvest in the end is not difficult to obtain. Because letters are something that everyone can write, the content only needs to be clear and simple. It does not need to be as tortuous and bizarre as making a story, with overly exaggerated descriptions and refined wording. Otherwise, it will become an [ordinary story]. If letters are applied to literary works and openly requested for readers to appreciate, then one must have artistic skill to write a so-called moving and successful work, which is still a kind of ordinary communication. Therefore, the stories written by most new entrants are relatively easy to obtain good results by adopting this letter style. However, the actual situation is not like that. The success of any literary work is not that simple. Sometimes the creation of the letter form often suffers miserably, which is also for this reason. Generally speaking, whatever literary work is, you must open up your own new path. Imitation and inheritance are not the attitudes that creation should have, and it will not be successful. Although this book [Plain Stationery] recently published by Ms. Lu Jingqing takes the form of letters, she has progressed in a new direction and cannot be compared with the general plain and simple epistolary literary works. Obviously, in China's weak literary garden, a new path has been opened.</p>
<p>According to the author herself, this collection of [Plain Stationery] is a letter to several acquaintances. After reading it all, I also feel that it is true. Although the ten [Plain Stationery] included in it undoubtedly take the form of letters, what she expresses is novel and commendable. That is, the old form is adopted and new content is added, which is really a rare work.</p>
<p>As far as I know, the author, Lu Jingqing, is a female poet with a strong sense of sentimentality. A collection of poems [Denunciation] was previously published in the Spring Tide Bookstore, and her poems have been introduced by Zan Hua in this journal. I have also read them. I think this [Plain Stationery] is more successful than her poems. Plain Stationery is really plain stationery with clear and simple beauty. Each article is written with her clear and delicate brush. Reading it sometimes makes us feel as light as if we are ascending to another world. This is really because her works are full of poetic beauty. The poet's inspiration is particularly rich and her skills are particularly superb. No matter what kind of work, if it is described by the hand of a poet, it will undoubtedly be able to convey the author's own feelings to the reader and be moved by the beauty of poetry. Therefore, this short ten [Plain Stationery] is more like a short story than a beautiful essay. Indeed, it is an early ten beautiful essays.</p>
<p>Her proud character has been maintained forever, and she still sticks to it without any change until she finishes writing the last letter. This can arouse the reader's admiration. It can especially be used as a model for ordinary women who are hesitant and uncertain. The realities written in each of her articles can also arouse our supreme interest. She is not like the romantic women of modern times who deliberately tease men. It is really because her personality is arrogant and she is unwilling to surrender to the knees of treacherous men and be a manipulated sacrifice. And she extremely distrusts men. The most interesting thing is that she never replied to a letter from this first acquaintance and they never told each other their names. Some of the men she met were in her aunt's small garden near the lake, some were on the same Yangtze River boat, some were at the swimming pool on Xishan during the summer vacation, some were at the public sports field tennis court, some were when she fell into the water and was rescued, some were on the way back south when her father died, some were after performing on stage, some were on the edge of a small pavilion on a beautiful autumn night, some were because he gave her a scarlet maple leaf, and some were because they came to attend Bo Jun's wedding banquet together. Therefore, each short note here exists independently. Even if you read them all in one breath, you will feel that there is a coherence and full of fun. As mentioned earlier, she is a female poet with a strong sense of sentimentality, so she still cannot get rid of the veil of sadness she wears in her plain stationery, but the sentimental color is much lighter than in her poems. Although sometimes she still wants to run to the positive journey and should [start doing things again], she can't reach the bright shore even if she struggles hard.</p>
<p>The first time I wandered to the edge of Baihuazhou, I was just struggling from an absolute situation, enduring the pain and wanting to create a new life and re-support myself. So at that time, on the one hand, I was working hard to forget the unbearable past dreams, and on the other hand, I was working hard to engage in my new career, hoping to be able to quickly escape from sorrow and frustration and do a good job. be a person</p>
<p>Seeing such a paragraph in her seventh note, we can know that her greatest hope is to [be a good person], but the final result is still not able to get rid of the desire to embark on the so-called negative path of death.</p>
<p>I was played by this secret in my heart as if a poisonous snake was entangled, I needed a painful intoxication, intoxicated to a long sleep never wake up</p>
<p>God knows that I just suffered serious injuries and struggled from the blood, I climbed to this new journey. I want to hold a painful heart in the world, completely because I am not willing to be succumbed to fate, so I endured the pain and ignited the torch of my life and ran on the road for the sake of doing something more meaningful, seeking a painful death.</p>
<p>Young men and women who live in the tragic stream of life always hope to rush to the journey of [death] when their spirits are extremely decadent, as if [death] is the last and most beautiful destination in life. We must know that the fact is not like this. The victory of death will always belong to the negative side. In today's era, especially for young men and women who have different interests in literature and art, they should grasp the [central idea of the nation] and run to the active journey to make conscious struggles. Singing the personal sorrow is not allowed in the present era.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Chinese nation has not yet achieved true freedom after thousands of years of oppression. Especially for young men and women who have different interests in literature and art, they should not hesitate to wake up and work hard to fight for the nation. The veil of sentimentality should have been torn off long ago and no longer cherish it.</p>
<p>The biggest shortcoming of this book is that it gives us a large amount of negative impressions and does not promote our efforts to the positive aspects.</p>
<p>However, there are several places written in this book that are enough to represent the characteristics of Chinese women, but most of them focus on weaknesses, which is a pity. If she could use the most long-term of Chinese women's national character with artistic skill, then this thin [Plain Stationery] would undoubtedly become a great and meaningful book. The sad components of the author have been reduced a lot compared to those expressed in her poems. In the future, it may be possible to completely overcome these sentimental colors. We also hope that the author can completely overcome the sentimental colors.</p>
