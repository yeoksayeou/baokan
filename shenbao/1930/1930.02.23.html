<p>國内要電</p>
<h3>蔣閻間往來兩要電</h3>
<p>閻致蔣號電—挑撥離間之言祈勿輕信　　蔣致阎養電—祇知有黨國不知有個人　　（南京）　總部發表閻致蔣號電、及蔣致閻養電、並錄如下、</p>
<p>（一）閻號電云、南京蔣總司令鈞鑒、奉讀皓電、惶恐無似、錫山追隨鈞座、共生死患難者有年矣、錫山自處如何、對鈞座如何、對國家如何、鈞座皆知之、諒我罪我、錫山决不願以一言一字致煩鈞聽、惟對於黨國安危大計、一得之愚、不忍緘默、錫山前電所陳、戡亂不如止亂、必須能止亂、戡亂始有結果、苟不能止亂、一味戡亂、</p>
<p>亂終無戡定之一日、錫山所見如此、全體大會爲黨國最高機關、不可貽人以口實、</p>
<p>若有貽人口實之處、必須設法消除、止亂有方、戡亂始有結果、至於編遣、固爲當務之急、惟黨國是以黨爲主體、個人中心之武力、是黨國之障礙、應一齊交還於黨、再實行編遣、否則鈞座編遣之苦衷、反不能使人諒解、而事實上亦窒礙難行也、</p>
<p>此錫山不憚忌諱、敢陳鈞座者、區區之意、純爲黨國久遠計耳、深望鈞座於此兩點、有所指示、錫山無不竭誠接受也、若謂錫山别辜負鈞座之謀、於津浦平漢準備軍事、純係挑撥離間者之言、祈勿輕信、是爲至禱、謹電陳復、並乞諒察、閻錫山叩號印、</p>
<p>（二）蔣總司令二十二復閻百川號電文曰、</p>
<p>太原閻副司令百川兄勛鑒、密號電奉悉中正皓電所陳扼要兩點、（一）兄自行取消禮讓引退之議、（一）兄實踐請煥章出洋之約、復其自由、實施編遣、此在兄極易採納、兄若毅然實行、則立即消釋　疑、乃來電概未置答、仍執似是而非之理論、重相責難、良可惋惜、革命理論、本極明瞭、服從黨國之命令與决議、爲黨國盡瘁犧牲而不辭、祇爲革命惟一信條、若舍去大本、别拾枝辭、往覆辯論、將如莊生所謂此亦一是非、彼亦一是非、徒亂人意、終無裨益、戡亂止亂之義、胡譚王三院長早爲兄詳言之、至全體大會之論、稚暉先生又重爲次隴院長明剖無遺、兄若捐除成見、明辦審思、必能豁然無疑、何待中正再辭費、以個人中心之武力、今日誠不宜再有、惟吾人所統率之武力、皆受之於黨國、吾人無背叛黨國之行動、</p>
<p>即武力爲捍衛黨國之干城、内省不疚、正不必以個人中心之武力自慚形穢、兄自居何等、誠不敢知、若中正則自信祇知有黨、衹知有國、不知有個人、吾人以身許黨、爲國服務、即舉生命與自由、盡獻之於黨國、以黨之意志爲意志、以國之休戚爲休戚、生命不敢自私、豈武力可據爲己有、但在黨國命令之下、造成健全之武力、用以戡定叛亂、實現主義、鞏固國防、正吾人天職所在也、今日本黨之武力、乃總理千辛萬苦艱難締造、付之吾人、</p>
<p>以求國民革命这成功者、中正躬受總理之付託、創辦黨軍、又奉黨國命令、就任國民革命軍總司令、及中華民國陸海空軍總司令、非敢以個人武力爲中心、受少數叛亂軍閥之推戴、不惜爲違犯黨紀反抗革命禍國殃民爭權奪利之具也、中正實不忍妄自菲薄、尤不願輕受誣衊、使中正果有背叛黨國之罪狀、黨國當予以最嚴厲之懲罰、又或中正違反黨紀、淆亂國是、倡爲黨人治黨國人治國之謬説、及别設樞密院元帥府以解决國事之怪論、</p>
<p>則亦無所逃於清議之責備、今中正惟服從黨國之命令、執行黨國所賦予之職權、</p>
<p>以爲黨國掃除叛逆、何得指爲個人中心之武力乎、兄與本黨革命歷史、或尙未盡明瞭、故鶩禮讓之虚名、責中正以引退、而不知兄議果見實行、無異爲反動者解除本黨武裝、阻止本黨革命、此中正所以萬萬不敢從命也、兄或謂總理曾讓位於袁世凱、以促成南北統一、中正何人、</p>
<p>乃違讓德、不知總理之讓位、係服從當時本黨幹部之决議、非徇任何人之請、</p>
<p>尤非自鳴高蹈、而總理畢生、尙以此事爲慽、使無讓位袁世凱之舉、實行總理革命之主張、澈底盪滌瑕穢、不與反革命者妥恊、則中國革命、早可成功、十餘年來、兵禍相尋、如袁氏之稱帝、溥儀之復辟、以及國民黨之解散、陳炯明之叛變等、使我革命黨之命脈、幾乎中絶者、皆當時一般失節黨員與無聊政客不明黨義販賣革命者高談禮讓所誤也、善學總理者、當學其致力革命百折不撓大無畏之精神、而彌補其遺憾、况今日黨國、又未嘗許中正以去職乎、編遣會議之産生與進行、實經過黨之决議、政府之命令、兄亦始終參預其事、今不能服從其决議案、</p>
<p>而必相約放棄黨國所付之重任、始能實施編遣、恐兄之苦衷、實不能使人諒解、</p>
<p>兄若眞能信仰革命之主義、服從黨國之命令、凡所指示、中正甚願竭誠討論、冀得真理、仍望於皓電所陳、切實賜答、否則革命與禮讓、真僞難容、文電往還、無補高明、徒災梨棗、甚爲感然不安也、弟蔣中正叩養印、（二十二日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>法國新内閣</h3>
<p>法内閣此次改組。情勢已大異乎前數次之改組矣。前此法内閣之屢倒以</p>
<p>其政黨離合無常。絶少團結之力。保守黨勢力尙在。故雖屢倒而政權時入保守派之手。今觀新閣。總理夏丹屬急進社會黨。加入新閣之急進社會　黨。合參衆兩院共計十人。共和社會黨一人。左派急進黨四人。民主黨一人。即以社會黨爲基礎之右派。亦未加入。故此次新閣員十六人中。幾乎全屬左派。可謂清一色之左黨内閣矣。</p>
<p>查法國左派諸黨。本以社會黨爲中堅。組織亦較早。一八八Ｏ年。該黨即已成立。惟其内部。旋分化爲數黨。未能團結一致。因之右派。常佔優勢。但至近來。左派逐漸進展。左傾日多。前次普恩賚内閣倒後。左派即欲起而代之。惟仍爲右派泰狄歐氏所得。而左派則仍欲逹組閣目的。嚴陣對付泰狄歐氏。藉財政問題。以事抨擊。故此次泰狄歐之倒。與夏丹之繼起實爲左右兩派之趨勢使然。</p>
<p>非漫然無故者也。法保守派報紙。料新閣壽命不永。急進派報紙。則稱得社會黨擁護。在國會中必佔多數。究之其壽命如何。姑觀其後可耳。</p>
<p>竊嘗謂近來各國之政潮。多起於急進派與温和派之爭。此次英相之脱離工黨。以左傾者多。波蘭國會之演全武行。起於左派議員與他派爭執。此外各國之政局。以左黨急進而起問題者。亦時有所聞。固不僅法内閣之變動已也。</p>

<h3>連日開票結果</h3>
<p>政府與黨大佔優勢　　無産當選不及一成　　電通社廿二日東京電　昨日總選舉開票結果、民政黨斷然優勢、關於本問題、</p>
<p>貴族院方面語人曰、民政黨得佔優勢、足知民心未去、願現内閣繼續存在、至政友候補多爲次多數、足爲軍資不足之證、</p>
<p>電通社　本日正午止所到逹之開票成績、政友會元老之田肇、已瀕於絕望、前農相山本亦頗爲悲觀、政友會方面大不似往日之高興、謂此係政府壓迫之結果、</p>
<p>非常憤慨云、</p>
<p>電通社　經三十日間之苦戰、坐待佳音之濱口首相、一面傾耳以聽各方如𪨻片飛來之報告、一面命備酒肴、與黨幹部暢飲、藉以助興、東京大阪之報告、均於已黨有利、首相尤喜形於色、</p>
<p>電通二十二日東京電　日總選舉各黨得票數、截至二十三日午前一時半、所得電訊如下、民政黨二六二、政友會一六五、同志會六、革新黨二、社民黨二、大衆黨二、勞農黨一、中立五、合計四四五、尙有定員二十一名、電訊未到、故結果不詳、而民政黨占過半數、已成確定事實、</p>
<p>電通社　京都第一區水谷前議員及河上肇博士、同第二區之細迫兼光、均爲無産派鬥士、不幸落選、由於蔑視地盤協定、及濫立候補、同志互鬨所致、所謂自掘其墓者、安部磯雄與鈴木文治亦皆戰敗、幸西尾末廣當選於大阪第三區、稍爲社會民衆黨吐氣、以舌辯之力、引起大衆之勞農黨首大山郁夫、亦於十二名候補之中、占第五位而當選、大衆黨之松谷與二郎亦當選、皆足爲無産黨生色者、然加藤勘十·堺利彦·中西伊之助·皆有當選希望、而竟落選、於是全國九十五名候補之無産黨、至昨日止、當選之數不到一成、最後所屬望者、僅九州之淺原·龜井·兩氏而已、若僅此數、不獨不能左右兩黨、即此方伸之新興勢力、恐亦有大缺陷云、</p>
<p>▲日聯社　無産黨確實當選之預想數、</p>
<p>爲十二三人、然開票結果竟致落選、考察無産黨戰敗之根本原因、非但互相對立抗爭之比較前次選舉猶爲繁雜、且有政府黨之精密計劃、至於右翼社會民衆黨衰退其階級爭鬥之志氣、而缺乏與既成政黨正面衝突这勇敢鬭意、爲最可歎、吾人觀其社民黨黨首安部磯雄及黨要人鈴木文治之落選、而得極左派勞農黨領袖</p>
<p>大山郁夫之當選、則可知彼大山之熱烈鬭志、感動民衆、現出如是意外結果也、</p>
<h3>法新閣員名單</h3>
<p>新總揆將請國會投信任票</p>
<p>軍縮首席代表改任白里安</p>
<p>▲國民社二十一日巴黎電　夏丹已組成新閣、閣員名單如下、總理兼内長夏丹、</p>
<p>外長白里安、財長杜蒙、副總理兼司法長史悌格、海長薩爾勞、陸長裴斯拉、工務總長杜朗、敎長逹賴狄愛、殖民總長龐納、航務總長逹尼洛、此次閣員共十六人、</p>
<p>原任參議員者四人、皆隸急進社會黨、原任衆議員者十二人、内隸急進社會黨者六人、共和社會黨者一人、左派急進黨者四人、民主黨者一人、夏氏新閣將於星期一出席國會、並同時請投信任票、按新閣全以社會黨爲基礎、右派拒絕加入、故保守派報纸多料其壽命不永、但急進黨報紙則稱、新閣得社會黨贊助後、在國會中至少可穏得二十票之多數云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十一日倫敦電　法總理夏丹通知英相麥唐納、將以外長白里安爲法國出席海軍會議首席代表、而以海軍總長薩爾勞·航務總長逹尼洛·殖民總長龐納·副之、按薩爾勞即前出席華盛頓海軍會議者、</p>
<h3>軍縮尃委會開會</h3>
<p>討論特種艦艇問題</p>
<p>▲電通社二十一日倫敦電　軍縮會議尃門委員會、於二十一日午后四時在聖哲木斯宮開會、各國尃門委員間討論之結果、一致决定、（一）制限外之艦船、照日内瓦會議所决定者區别之、（二）特殊艦艇·水上飛機·運輸艦。及練習艦等、以承認現有勢力爲程度、而制限其力、（三）代艦建造之際、不以之入於輕巡洋艦驅逐艦等艦種之中、而入於制限外之艦艇、（四）特殊艦艇將來除去艦種分類、同時决定除法國外、所有尃門委員於二十二日再會、草成報告書、報告於第一委員會、六時半散會、</p>
<h3>西班牙改建共和</h3>
<p>前首相子願爲贊助▲路透社二十一日瑪德里電　西班牙著名保守黨領袖曾任首相茅拉之子今日演説、其警句曰、苟有要人舉起共和之旗、</p>
<p>余願從之、此言頗震動政界、現籌備日後選舉之各政黨、漸知民主問題、勢必發生、而將成左右選舉票數之堅强要素、前保守黨首相古拉博士曾在狄克推多制下被撃囹圄者、其對於政體之態度如何、現頗爲人所重視、其人爲帝制派、但渠對於國王阿爾方沙之忠貞、則殊堪疑問、故人亟欲聞其將於下星期四日發表之重要言論</p>
<h3>蘇俄農民備受壓迫</h3>
<p>牲畜驟减…肉食大缺▲路透社二十一日里加電　自蘇俄中央執行委員會决定凡在已成立公有制度各區域内之富農、必須驅逐、及其産業必須没收後、壓迫農夫之舉動、現進行愈猛、</p>
<p>此爲史丹林五年實業計劃下之政策結果、一般農夫宰其牛羊等畜而自食之、然後加入公有農塲、伏爾嚘河下游及高加索境内、在過去數月内、牲畜已减其半、而波斯邊界附近之俄農、則驅牛羊入波斯境而售之、此舉顯與蘇當道之命令抵觸、</p>
<p>都市中肉食現已大缺、莫斯科人民因當</p>
<p>道有每月素食十日之决議、頗爲不滿、</p>
<h3>運美乾蛋增税一倍</h3>
<p>吾國獨受影響▲美聯社廿一日華盛頓電　參院今日考慮税則案、採納賀威爾氏之動議、將乾蛋税由一角八分增至三角六分、此舉除中國外、外國出口商均不受影響、至是新税則農業項乃告完畢、</p>
<p>普魯士國會</p>
<h3>不信總理動議否决</h3>
<p>國民社二十一日柏林電　普魯士國會、對於不信任總理白朗動議案、經兩日之劇辯後、業以二一七案對一九八票否决、按此項動議、係經濟黨提出、由於白朗舉社會民主黨格列謨爲敎育總長而起、國權派議員亦因白朗因訓令聯邦會議中普魯士代表贊成楊格計劃、故加入經濟黨共謀倒閣、</p>
<h3>無線電話發展奇速</h3>
<p>英澳間試騐成績美滿　　倫敦漸成世界總樞紐▲路透社二十一日倫敦電　無線電話現發展甚速、倫敦漸成世界之總樞紐、英澳間之電話、試騐已有美滿成功、不久官塲將有英澳互通電話供人利用之佈告、昨日郵局已開辦倫敦與羅馬敎皇國間接通電話之新事業、英國刻已能與海上船隻通話、不久各電話局與各大商船間、將有互相接談之新便利、英美間在一年前僅有話路一條、嗣因營業大增、今有話路四條、然猶不敷用也、證劵經紀人及其他商人、已承認穿越大西洋電話、爲營業上必要之輔助、故用者逐漸增多、目前每日有一千次、</p>
<h3>澳洲礦工暴動案</h3>
<p>滋事工人已分别定判▲路透社二十一日雪梨電　澳洲艾施頓礦區、一月十日發生騷擾礦工四千包圍礦山、剥下不入工會礦工二人之衣服而焚之、當時滋事工人被拘者、共七十二人、送法庭究辦、今日法庭判定六十八人、各罰金若干、最多者爲十八磅、其中三人有傷害他人之行爲、被判監禁三月、</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<h3>立法院七十七次會議</h3>
<p>立法院今日（二十二日）上午八時開第七十七次會議、出席委員焦易堂史尙寛陳肇英林彬馬寅初等三十二人、主席胡漢民、討論事項如下、（一）審議主計總監部組織法草案、議决主計總監部組織法案、修正通過、呈請中央政治會議决定、（二）行政院第五十八次會議决議、咨請頒布銀錢公會單行法規案、議决交商法起草委員會審查、（三）審議補充考選委員會組織法條文案、議决交法制委員會審查、（四）審議黨員犯罪加重處刑暫行條例草案、議决修正通過、（五）本院委員焦易堂羅鼎林彬史尙寛呂志伊王用賓吳尙鷹會同經濟委員會商法起草委員會報告審查商事公斷處條例草案、及商事公斷處施行細則草案、議决照審查報告通過、商事公斷處條例暫無製定之必要、（六）本院法制委員會會同軍事委員會報告審查修正國民革命軍陸軍審判條例案、議决、交法制軍事兩委員會整理條文後、再提交下次大會討論、</p>
<h3>中宣部發表告同胞書</h3>
<p>（再續）</p>
<p>基於上述諸現象、本黨深念同胞之創痛已極、萬不容虐民之封建勢力乘機再起、即人民必須獲得休養生息之時機、國家必須逹到自由平等之地位、其唯一之策略、只有和平與統一、蓋惟和平然後可以恢復社會之元氣、惟統一然後可以建立國家之權力、和平統一、乃中央本人民實際需要而定之根本政策、力行此政策者、乃人民之友、違背此政策者、即人民之敵、而對於此政策之向背試騐、即其是否服從中央而已、蓋殘餘之封建勢力、亦知口呼和平與統一、但一叩其實現和平統一之方法、則非服從中央而爲反抗中央、</p>
<p>如日黨事由黨人解决、國是由國人解决、則和平統一、亦可實現、此其荒謬愚拙、時賢斥之已衆、</p>
<p>夫本黨革命之目的、對外在恢復中華同族固有之光榮、對内在造成民權伸張民生樂利之社會、</p>
<p>換言之、即本黨之行動、一依三民主義之昭示、</p>
<p>使中國造成一眞正民有民治民享之國家、是則黨之與國、須臾難離、倘離去中國國民黨而圖解决國是、勢必求敎於已被國人擯斥之帝制遺　反動軍閥及共産黨徒等、使重登政治之舞台、再演張勲曹錕及賀龍葉挺等稱亂時代之舊劇、更加人民生活上以慘痛之資料而已、若謂舍此尙有辦法、則除起用楊度等再作一次籌安外、决無滿意之理、惜乎今日之中國、以袁世凱之智之才、尙不能安坐南面、况自僧以下者耶、此説既已不通、乃反其道而行、曰禮讓爲國、相偕下野、</p>
<p>是亦可以促進和不統一之成功、此其以個人權利地位爲中心之思想、不　自暴其關門皇帝之面目、蓋中央爲人民之所共有、負中央之職貴者、皆爲人民之公傼、個人本身只有義務可言、</p>
<p>絶無權利可享、其服務之當否、惟革命的原則可以判斷、絶非虚僞的禮讓所能相繩、一心爲黨爲國者已雖欲去、而人民必不容許、毁黨誤國者、</p>
<p>雖欲不去、終必爲人民所推翻、至以自身所犯之錯誤、而貴革命者同去職守、此種求和平統一之法、眞千古未有之奇談也吾人試細心體察事實之正面、則知一切違抗中央、而侈言和平統一者、無不磨牙碾齒、準備以人民之骨血、而　個人之錢吻、蓋封建勢力盤據於中央與人民之間、一方抰中央以剝削地方、一方借地方以脅制中央、故亦假言和平統一、以隠蔽其無法無天之罪惡、吾人欲打破中央與人民間之障碍、非實現眞正和平統一不可　今殘餘封建勢力、因見和平統一政策、於彼輩割據地盤、</p>
<p>剥削人民之素習有不利、遂迭起反抗、而出於叛亂之途　中央爲求贯澈國家與人民利害相同之和平統一政策、對於隠而未發之一切叛亂、莫不謁誠勸誨、是即謂之止亂、對於已發而不能勸止之叛亂、乃依人民之要求、加以討伐　是即謂之　亂、同時對於屢次製造叛亂之殘餘封建勢力、</p>
<p>無不冀其認清時代之要求、洗心革面　消滅封建</p>
<p>思想於無形、是乃謂之弭亂、彼一般封建餘孽未能切實明瞭人民之環境與願望　斷斷然惟個人權利之是求　且以此妄測負有革命的偉大使命者之胸襟以爲過去北京軍閥政府統治之時代、</p>
<p>一切紛爭、皆緣個人權利而起、若有一紙下野之宣言、即爲脱卸自身之責任、不知今日之政府、</p>
<p>乃爲革命之政府、凡服務於革命政府者、其自身之權利自由、即已貢獻於黨國、黨國之任務未了、雖鞠躬盡瘁、所不能辭、况當此列强尙肆紛擾人民未得解放、奮鬥犧牲、猶虞不久、遑言下野、</p>
<p>若以身居高位、即可上下在心、是直以國家人民之重託爲兒戲、其不增加紛亂者幾希、由是可知必秉受總理遺敎及本黨歷史的使命者、方足與言弭亂、必始終一贯服從黨國命令者、始足以言戡亂、必深知人民痛苦國家危亡之迫切、而誠心共圖建設者、方足與言止亂、若貌似恭順、而行險詐者、均不足與語此、（未完）</p>
<h3>淮揚人士</h3>
<p>要求疏浚張福運河　　淮揚各縣人士鑒於各該縣連年旱潦不一、飢饉薦臻、咸感導淮之議不可或緩、惟茲事體大、殊非縣省財力所能蕆事、國府亦因事實困難、興工濬導、爲期有待、第以與兩屬各縣最關切要之張福運河、年久失修、河身淤淺、若能從事疏濬、則源流充暢、各縣獲益匪淺、舉辦亦較易易、</p>

<p>爲救濟江北災巟唯一之良策、連年旱災、</p>
<p>地方財力凋敝、居民相繼死亡、生機斷絶、若再不治河救濟、則淮揚膏腴之地、</p>
<p>將變爲甘陜不毛之田、敝會係臨時性質、</p>
<p>春賑辦後、决計結束、儻不幸再罹凶荒、</p>
<p>將何以堪、爲治本計、自應亟圖疏治張福運河、敝會承諸位之屬、曾屢向省政府代爲呼籲、鄙人並於省賑務會議席上提議一次、蒙各委認爲當務之急、現在建設廳亦主張此舉、正在審查、財政廳允極力籌欵、導淮會並有亟舉辦之議、此不可不感激者、但諸位係代表民意、應起而合力籌之、至如何興工、應請省府建財民諸廳趕緊籌賓主辦云云、旋經各代表討論結果、議决、（一）即日成立疏濬張福運河促進會、（二）立赴省政府各廳請願、（三）推鮑汪李三代表於請願時陳述意見、散會後即聯袂分赴省府各廳請願、當遇鈕主席何廳長暨其他各廳主管人員、均允於下星期二提出省府會議、各代表認爲滿意而散、</p>

<p>尙須兼顧貨運、方不失運輸之主旨、本廳再三考慮、以爲建築公路、對於短距離載運旅客、固多利益、但對於長距離之貨運客運、均不經濟、如改建鐵路、則省欵難籌、未易着手、一再籌劃、似以改築輕便鐵路爲最宜、需費既少、效用亦廣、茲將輕便鐵路比較公路優點、列舉如下、（一）</p>
<p>輕便鐵路建築費、連車輛設備、每華里約需一萬一千元、公路建築費連車輛設備、每華里約需八千元、現在各公路所費、亦需一萬餘元、兩者所費、相差無幾、但鐵路建成之後、培養之費甚輕、其使用年限亦較久遠、（二）輕便鐵路之輸運、載量較大、平均每列車載客約四百人、貨物約二百噸、公路則載量既小、又不能爲長距離之運輸、（三）鐵路車輛、經久耐用、平均每車可用十年至十五年、汽車僅能维持最多五年、（四）鐵路所用燃料爲煤、主要材料爲鋼鐵、均可取諸本國、汽車所用燃料爲汽油、主要材料爲車胎等、均須購自國外、再查正太狹軌鐵路、營業極爲發逹、上川輕便鐵道、辦理亦有成效、餘如</p>

<p>柳江煤礦公司之輕便鐵道、每列車可掛車十八輛、載貨一百八十噸、每車載客人數三四十人、較諸公路、便利甚多、以彼例此、倘能將　常路改作輕便鐵道、將來收入、定可增加、除該項預算擬俟將來另行提案外、事關變更成案、是否可行、理合先行提案、敬請公决、」</p>

<p>然後逐漸改進、期作澈底之整理、治標之舉、首重清查、清查之法、不外先將各縣歷年欠賦、派員照額清追、限期征解、舉凡田少糧多、田多糧少、有田無糧、有糧無田之弊、以及糧户眞正姓名住址、田地坐落、數量糧額、等差多寡、均於清查時作附带之調查、規定册式、分别詳載、又須嚴令各縣、無論籌何欵項、不准先將糧劵截抵現欵、致滋虧挪、并限制附加、以免影響正供、嚴禁包征、以杜吏胥中飽、防止自由提撥、以免紊亂賦政、以上種種、無非積極治標、以爲治本之第一步工作、即該原呈所謂調查登記報價、均須按步進行之意也、敝府對於清查田賦田畝、業已列入政綱、正擬逐漸舉行、惟苦積弊太深、尙無具體辦法、正盼貴部迅予頒定良規、以資遵守、准咨前因、相應略抒管見、藉供採擇、請煩查照爲荷、一</p>

<p>因此番所爭在於東路、蔡運昇之代表權限、自亦限於討論東路範圍、其他關於中俄一般問題、自非蔡之職權所能討論、即東北當局亦無權解决、故中内對蔡越權簽訂之草約、聲明除屬於東路者外、概不承認、俄人之目的、亦在恢復東路七月以前原狀、自不應引用草約、有其他要求、</p>
<p>故自外部宣言發出後、俄人亦未有何種反響、蓋一則　於吾國民氣不可侮、一則在國際亦恐説不過去也、中央此次派本人赴俄、出席會議、本人曾力不獲、卒以職責關係、不能不勉爲其難、當以忠於國家及大無畏精神折衝樽爼、俄人若有所威脅、决不爲屈、中央所畀與本人之權限、亦只限於討論東路問題、即繼續　中俄奉俄兩協定之規定、求解决之辦法、奉俄協定、訂明六十年後吾國可無條件收回東路、未逹年限亦可備價贖回、伹如何評價、及如何付欵、能否以債劵贖付、於此次會議中均當議及、又在未贖回之前、當討論一最公平之會同管理方法、免再起爭端、此次爭端、乃因不公平而起、俄人欲免此後爭端再起、對共管方法、自當樂與我方討論、本人回遼後、尙須至哈料理各事、須三月中旬始克動身赴俄、外交鐡道兩部所派之尃門家、亦當同行、以便諮詢、此次東北當局應付東路之事、煞費苦心、固知以東北之力不足以　俄人全國之力、但迫於爲國家爭體面、爲民族爭人格、不能不出師禦敵、詎國事日非、内戰迭起、某國復欲乘機挑　、東省十萬之師、暴露逹半歲、公私損失、難以臆計、俄寇日深、沿邊之十餘縣、均被其蹂躪、勢將越興安嶺而東、呼倫貝爾業有蘇維埃政府之組織、南聯蒙古青年團、欲赤化滿托各地、沿邊各縣人民羣起呼　、乞當局早日解决爭端、故始有雙城子之初次會商、當時傳俄人有向我方在求賠償兵費、</p>
<p>及駐兵護路之説、幸未實現、故更有伯力之會、蔡運昇雖有失檢之處、試一回想當時之困難、可諒之處亦多、不知内容者第在書面苛求、去事實亦甚遠、今經中央否認一部、亦足補救矣」云云、莫氏一行、於昨夜十二時、巳由東車站搭通車出發、</p>

<h3>吳稚暉先生蒞常之趣語</h3>
<p>— 文軌</p>
<p>黨國要人吳稚暉先生。爲其族妹可秀女士與趙連城結婚。於十八日來常作證婚人。茲得趣語頗多。約記如下。</p>
<p>吳先生抵常後。在街市游覽一周。旋寓華商旅館。化名吳翰青　晚間有友人朱仲超信新聞記者往訪。吳拒不接見。友人等隔門固請。吳答我已就睡。且衣服完全脱云。有話明天講。不能開關。</p>
<p>十九日上午。吳先生赴東郊游覽天寗寺文筆塔。在天寗寺見一僧正怒目嚴詰一僧。並加痛擊。至文筆塔頂。作「六十年前老把戲」一文。趣語甚多。詳述寺僧之不應有官氣。被菩薩要悲痛等語。此文交中山報記者范拜竹發表。</p>
<p>有詢吳先生係常州人。抑係無鍚人。吳答我生長武進。當然是武進人。然日操無錫口音。可以説是無錫人。住了上海十多年。又可以説是上海人。總而言之。論國籍。予固中國人也。言罷大笑</p>
<p>吳先生在證婚時致詞。語多售妙。略謂我今天到常州來。要説幾句常州話。戴溪橋之趙家。與雪堰橋之吳家。本是舊親。</p>
<p>現又結了新親。以後還望繼續的結下去。</p>
<p>趙連城在外讀書多年。也讀得好了。舍妹學問優秀。所以又取名可秀。可以説是美滿的婚姻。現在各樣事體都進步了。鄉下人也到城裏來結婚。㖠呢格鄉下人。到城裏來結婚。是拿得出。這也足以自傲的。</p>
<p>剛才説要講常州話。又説不起來。現在祇可混合無錫常州蘇州話説説吧。今日吳家俚趙家俚兩家結婚。我還有一句祝頌的話。就是「多子多孫。」</p>
<p>吳先生事畢。於是日下午五時赴車站動身。先後購上海與南京車票兩紙。趁車時。係五點十五分之下行通車。大約係向上海方面而去。</p>
<p>吳先生與友人段孟陶譚及飛機。他説曾坐過飛機兩次在第一次未坐前。以爲飛機很難坐。其實與在平地上無大差異。</p>
<p>坐後亦甚穏當、在其上可寫字或走動。我坐飛機。被胡展堂駡過一塲。他説總以爲你吳稚暉十年前已經坐過飛機。不料你今日綫第一次坐等語。還有一種飛機。値價五萬美金、核華金十萬元。其上可關十個坐位。有休息處。有寫字檯。此種飛機。</p>
<p>曾勸蔣介石買一架。譬如一聲要到廣州去。十個鐘頭就可以逹到了。</p>
<h3>洪武遺跡話鳳陽</h3>
<p>— 王定九</p>
<p>鳳陽爲皖北户。明帝朱元璋之桑梓也。勝蹟流傳。頗多佳話。社友吳君。執敎鳳地垂七載。去臘因假期冋滬。</p>
<p>社中人讌之酒樓。席次。偶及洪武故事。</p>
<p>頗多可紀。爰書以告自由談謮者。</p>
<p>▲碩大無朋之鐡鑊　鳳城北門外三里許。田野間有碩大無比之大鐡鑊五。相傳爲昔遭兵燹。荒歉連年。皖北饑饉。明帝眷念民困。乃飭吏於此施粥賑災。鐡鑊即前用以煑粥者。據云每粥一鑊。足供五百人果腹。由此可見其容積之巨矣。傳昔有某寺小沙彌。煑粥時。趨鑊旁閒視。一不經意。失足墮入。時衆皆茫然。及三日後。鑊粥告罄。始於鍋底發現白骨一堆。隣寺又经走失小沙彌聞。始悉遭此慘死焉。</p>
<p>▲閉户已是天曉時　洪武出身平民。幼失怙恃。曾一度至黄龍寺爲僧。該寺爲鳳地大刹。廟貌宏大。相傳明時該寺佔地百餘畝。門户數十。入晚閉户。山門下鍵。依次而至後户。入時明朋當頭。出則東方魚肚白矣。範圍廣大有如此者。該寺自紅羊遭　。今之存者惟十之一耳。</p>
<p>▲明陸前之劍粟　洪武之墓。建首都。據紫金山。與孫總理共垂不朽。其父母墓。</p>
<p>則在故邑。離城六里奇。北地多北物。遍地皆是。洪武襁褓時。其母曝便布於其上。感劍粟刺手。乃憤曰。何不下向便人。</p>
<p>昻然何爲。言竟。劍粟果向下。事聞於衆。</p>
<p>莫不驚訝。乃目洪武非凡人。後果登極。</p>
<p>歷今數百年。明陵方里地。所生劍粟。其刺皆下向。期亦一異也。</p>
<h3>曹州花絮</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>曹州位于濟寗之西。自昔爲軍家所必爭。亦魯省之屏障也。予友錢子淵如嘗往主六中敎務。歸來談該地狀况綦詳。爰略誌以告讀者。　　曹州于前清爲府。然一至其地。滿目荒凉。街道奇仄。其城廂猶不如蘇省較大之市區。民風强悍。人民多善技擊吾人在滬所見之大力士表演。爲之驚　勿已者。</p>
<p>在曹則了無則了無足奇。曾有一次。一兵士與某學生衝突。數兵合攻生。反爲所敗。鼠竄而去。</p>
<p>曹地居民。多有烟癖。市　中十之五六爲紙烟舖。所吸多爲哈德門牌。每年之消耗。實爲可驚、所用以交易者。皆爲雙銅元。每洋一元。可易錢三千。生活程度甚低。故居此費用極省。重要出産。厥惟水菓。若梨若桃。既大且甘。而爲值每枚不過二三十文。菓樹至夥。客過取而食之。絶不干涉。惟不能携出耳。倘能運滬。價當倍蓰矣。曹地男女之間。仍守授受不親之古風。女子行路。男子例不得窺視。其略不經意者。路人即羣起而毆之。初至其地者。每不知此。用是被毆者良不乏人。入國問境。不可不知也。</p>
<p>居民淳厚古樸敏於學而鈍於資。對師長極器重。每晨五時。即聞書聲。所也柿霜一種。療痔疾有神效。亦特産也。</p>

<p>前日閘北共和路明興里桓劉氏家。忽有一對素不相識之野駌鴦。在樓下廂房中回圓好夢。缘樓下廂房係賃於木匠陳某居住。陳每日外出作工。皆不閉門。是日桓劉氏買菜歸來。忽見廂房門緊閉。必焉疑之。就門隙一窺。遂發現交頸而眠之男女。鳴警捕去。野駌鴦擅入人家幽會。誠屬千古奇聞。荒唐之至。不謂無獨有偶。一昨公平路華姓家。亦發生同様情事。華姓自居前樓。只夫妻一女。夫在某公司服務。朝出晚歸。婦嗜雀。日就鄰家作竹林遊。女猶稚。喜戀母。維時婦適徜徉於竹林中。囑女守户。歡未幾而女亦離家就母。局散歸來。房門忽由内加鍵。推之不動。大驚呼怪。房内正有一對野駌鴦。蘧蘧然欲仙欲死。聞聲亦驚。怱怱啓户。則男女皆不識。相視愕然。而春意融融。</p>
<p>猶　兩人之眉稍眼内也。婦乃不禁大譁。野駌鴦更窘。吵駡問。賃居後樓之某姓自外歸。男子奔就之。某詫問何故。男子　然告以誤入。請求排解。蓋男子與某爲同鄉友。一日在途中相值。得悉某之寓址。特諧其情婦來訪。誤入前樓。一時因　笑而衝動慾念。以爲某係好友。並未携眷屬來滬。不妨暫假圖片刻歐歡娛。孰意乃不幸而大出共醜也。卒以某姓排解。罰其在房中點燭焚香。驅除晦氣而罷。較諸閘北野駌鴦受警局十五天拘留之罰。猶屬便宜云。</p>
<h3>靈犬</h3>
<p>— 嵇覲</p>
<p>鄰家朱姓。畜一犬。性甚　。</p>
<p>凡事能得主人歡。一日。</p>
<p>犬忽患目疾。粘液滿眶。勢將成盲。乃延醫療治。醫曰。吾先試以治人之藥治之。如無效。再圖良法可也。遂令犬伏其旁。经藥塗之。藥性猛。痛極狂吠。並不却走。有頃。病愈大半。次日。醫復至。犬則搖首擺尾。一若表示歡悦及感謝之忱者。繼而俛首就醫。與人無異。逮搽藥畢。則又徘徊顧盼。跬步弗離。必俟醫去。送至門外而止。如是者三四次。人莫不稱爲靈犬云。</p>
<h3>歐遊通訊　（四二）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>▲蒲台爾之死　Ａntoine　Bourdlle</p>
<p>三、他的藝術（下）</p>
<p>創造『行動的人』與『思想家』的羅丹。他愛用强有力的神經質的肌肉。實現於雕刻的動作中。似乎是一道『力』與『思想』的靈光。輝耀震爍於全宇宙。他那崇高神奇的天才。與他那强有力的人體的表現力。使他從自已造成的這種藝術的主要流弊中超拔出來。他的許多生徒們。只想把自己詭怪化。奇特化　於是便犯了這些重大的毛病。徒然改變了形式。而實質上却是一無所有。就是雕刻的材料的講究。</p>
<p>也絶對忽略了。這些衰頽的現象。激起薄台爾追懹到遂古文明的永久性。他從彌克朗琪　Ｍichel　ˉAnge而悟到彫刻家的事業。並不在於雕琢一個漂亮的外表。而在於把莊嚴有力的形式。從粗礪的頑石中創造起來。因此。在長久的思索探求之後。蒲台爾終於得到了新的發見。他極精心地注意雕刻的材料。而又不囿于材料。在追求表現的新形式中。同時在謹愼地避免牠的危險。　　羅丹也不隠諱他對於他的高足的嘆賞。</p>
<p>『蒲台爾是在上斷的推論中。尋求『眞實』得了新的。便棄了舊的。從没有遲疑與後悔。他的作品是非常地理性的。每一個細微之處。都有它存在的理由　在全體中有重要的價値。一點也没有偶然的發見。也絶無重複。更無生硬的部分。他的線條是謹嚴而沉着。並非罟爲他的天才貧乏之故。却是他綜合的必然的結果。』你礁。這是他技巧方面的評價。再没有什麽可以附加的意見或是可以辯論的地方了。　　然而蒲台爾並不如其餘的『建立論者』（Ｃonstrucheur）一様。他並不抑制感情的激發。只是他深知駕御他而已</p>
<p>蒲台爾受了種種不同的影響。但到處有他自己的面目。他自羅馬。希臘。巴比倫。埃及得來的形式。都依他自已的心靈改造過了。　就爲這點。他才能把近代藝術的顧動。與愛琴海文化的聖潔。文藝復興的偉大與奥林比亞的沉靜結合起來。溝通起夾。要這一點上。大藝術家比戰死沙塲的光榮的戰士要偉大到千百倍了。因爲戰爭所給予我們的印象是仇恨。而藝人遺留於後人的。却是令人看了更知感奮。更知相愛眞美的作品。眞美在羣星輝耀間。是永遠不能磨滅的。</p>
<h3>常識屑</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>携带巨額鈔票時。應穿蹩脚衣服。嘗見青年驕矜性成。</p>
<p>購物時以巨束鈔票街人。不知足以釀成殺身之禍。被刦尙屬小事　　當這幾末書汎時期。至商務等大書店購書。應在上午九時初開門時。否則必令你恭候多時。</p>
<p>在電車站隣近兑銀洋。必令你損失幾個銅子。　　在馬路上買便宜貨。保你上當　在輪船上買香烟。保你吃着假貨。</p>
<p>不貪財色。無論海上怎様天荊地棘。决不陷入羅網。</p>

<h3>Two Important Telegrams Between Chiang and Yan</h3>
<p>Yan's Telegram to Chiang: Please Do Not Lightly Believe Slanderous Words Intended to Sow Discord</p>
<p>Chiang's Telegram to Yan in Reply: I Only Know the Party and the Nation, I Do Not Know Any Individuals</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The headquarters released Yan's telegram to Chiang and Chiang's telegram to Yan in reply, as recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Yan's Telegram: To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Nanjing, Upon reading your telegram, I was extremely apprehensive. Xishan has followed you, sharing life, death, and hardship for many years. You know how Xishan conducts himself, how I treat you, and how I treat the nation. Whether you understand me or blame me, Xishan will never bother you with a single word. However, regarding the important matters of the Party-state's safety and security, I cannot remain silent about my humble opinion. My previous telegram stated that suppressing the chaos is not as good as stopping the chaos. We must be able to stop the chaos for suppressing it to have results. If we cannot stop the chaos and only suppress it, the chaos will never be suppressed. This is what Xishan sees. The plenary session is the highest organ of the Party-state and should not give others an excuse to criticize it. If there is anything that would give people an excuse, we must find a way to eliminate it. If we can stop the chaos, suppressing it will bear fruit. As for disarmament, it is indeed an urgent task. However, the Party-state should take the Party as the main body. Military force centered on individuals is an obstacle to the Party-state and should be handed over to the Party entirely before disarmament is implemented. Otherwise, your good intentions for disarmament will not be understood, and it will be difficult to implement in reality. This is what Xishan dares to say to you, despite the risk of being seen as meddlesome. My intention is purely for the long-term interests of the Party-state. I sincerely hope that you will give instructions on these two points, and Xishan will accept them sincerely. If you believe that Xishan is plotting against you and preparing for military action in Tianjin-Pukou and Pinghan, these are just slanderous words intended to sow discord. Please do not lightly believe them. This is my earnest request. I respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration and understanding. Yan Xishan bows in respect.</p>
<p>(2) Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Reply to Yan Baichuan on the Twenty-Second:</p>
<p>To Vice Commander Yan Baichuan in Taiyuan, I have received your confidential telegram and understand the two key points you raised in your telegram: (1) that you voluntarily cancel the proposal to yield and retire; (2) that you fulfill your promise to send Huanzhang abroad, restore his freedom, and implement disarmament. These are things that you can easily adopt. If you resolutely implement them, doubts will be immediately dispelled. However, your telegram did not address these points at all but instead reiterated seemingly correct but ultimately misguided theories and repeated accusations. This is truly regrettable. Revolutionary theory is inherently clear: to obey the orders and resolutions of the Party-state, to devote oneself to the Party-state and sacrifice oneself without hesitation, and to take this as the only tenet of the revolution. If we abandon this foundation and instead focus on peripheral arguments and engage in endless debates, it will be like Zhuangzi's saying, "This is also a 'this and that,' and that is also a 'this and that'," which only confuses people and ultimately does no good. Hu Tan and Wang, the three presidents of the Yuan, have already explained the meaning of suppressing chaos and stopping chaos to you in detail. As for the plenary session, Mr. Zhihui has also clearly analyzed it for President Cilong without leaving anything out. If you can discard your prejudices and carefully consider things, you will surely be clear about everything. Why should I waste any more words? Military force centered on individuals is truly inappropriate today. However, the military force that we command has all been entrusted to us by the Party-state. We have no intention of betraying the Party-state. Our military force is the bulwark of the Party-state. With a clear conscience, there is no need to feel ashamed of military force centered on individuals. I dare not presume to know how you view yourself, but I am confident that I only know the Party and the Nation, and I do not know any individuals. We pledge ourselves to the Party and serve the nation. We dedicate our lives and freedom to the Party-state. We take the will of the Party as our will and the joys and sorrows of the nation as our joys and sorrows. We dare not be selfish with our lives. How can we claim military force as our own? However, under the orders of the Party-state, creating a strong military force to suppress rebellions, realize our ideals, and consolidate national defense is our duty. Today, the military force of our Party was painstakingly created by the Premier.</p>
<p>It was entrusted to us so that the National Revolution could succeed. I have personally received the Premier's entrustment, founded the Party army, and, following the orders of the Party-state, took office as Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the Republic of China. I dare not take military force centered on individuals as my focus, accept the support of a small number of rebellious warlords, and become a tool for violating Party discipline, opposing the revolution, harming the country, and seizing power and profit. I truly cannot bear to belittle myself and do not want to be lightly slandered. If I were to betray the Party-state, the Party-state should impose the most severe punishment on me. Or, if I were to violate Party discipline, confuse national policies, advocate the fallacy of Party members governing the Party-state and the people governing the country, and put forward the strange theory of establishing a separate Privy Council and Marshal's Office to resolve national affairs, then I would not escape the blame of public opinion. Now, I only obey the orders of the Party-state and perform the duties assigned to me by the Party-state in order to eliminate rebels for the Party-state. How can this be called military force centered on individuals? Perhaps you are not fully aware of the revolutionary history of our Party. Therefore, you covet the false reputation of yielding and blame me for retreating, not knowing that if your proposal were implemented, it would be tantamount to disarming our Party, preventing our Party from carrying out the revolution. This is why I absolutely cannot obey. You may say that the Premier once yielded to Yuan Shikai in order to promote national unity. Who am I to defy his virtue? But you do not know that the Premier's yielding was to obey the resolutions of the Party's cadres at the time and not to satisfy anyone's request. Moreover, the Premier always regretted this matter. If he had not yielded to Yuan Shikai, implemented the Premier's revolutionary program, thoroughly eradicated corruption, and not compromised with counter-revolutionaries, then the Chinese revolution could have succeeded long ago. For more than ten years, wars have followed one after another. Events such as Yuan Shikai's proclaiming himself emperor, Puyi's restoration, the dissolution of the Kuomintang, and Chen Jiongming's rebellion, which almost interrupted the lifeline of our revolutionary party, were all caused by those unprincipled Party members and frivolous politicians who did not understand Party doctrine and sold the revolution, talking glibly about yielding. Those who learn from the Premier well should learn his spirit of dedicating himself to the revolution, never giving up, and being fearless, and make up for his regrets. Moreover, the Party-state has not allowed me to resign. The creation and progress of the disarmament conference have been through the resolutions of the Party and the orders of the government. You have also participated in it from beginning to end. Now, you cannot obey its resolutions and insist on abandoning the important responsibilities entrusted to you by the Party-state before disarmament can be implemented. I am afraid that your good intentions will not be understood. If you can truly believe in the principles of the revolution and obey the orders of the Party-state, I am willing to discuss everything sincerely in order to find the truth. I still hope that you will give a sincere reply to the points raised in your telegram. Otherwise, revolution and yielding are incompatible, and exchanging telegrams will not help those who are wise. It will only damage the pear wood blocks used for printing, which is very worrying and unsettling. Your brother, Chiang Chung-cheng, bows in respect. (Special Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Liu Wentao Returned to Hankou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Negotiations in Hunan Successfully Concluded</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Wentao returned to Hankou by plane from Changsha in Hunan on the 22nd. He told reporters that the trip was very successful. He Jian expressed his determination to support the central government and promote peaceful unification as his fixed aim. He will resolutely deal with anyone who rebels against the central government with all his strength. The four routes have already entered Guangxi with two divisions led by Liu Jianxu, and it will be pacified soon. Liu plans to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd to report to Chiang and attend the Third Plenary Session. The municipal government is still being handled by Huang Zhenxing.

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Two</p>
<p>He Yingqin's Telegram to Liang</p>
<p>Instructing Him to Persuade Yan to Rein in at the Brink</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin sent a telegram to Liang Ruzhou, Yan's representative in Shenyang, on the 22nd, marked as confidential. It has been half a year since we last met. I wonder how you are. Baichuan has always taken supporting the central government and maintaining peace as his duty. I never thought that he would actually use the beautiful name of yielding as the initiative for launching chaos. I was shocked and deeply regretted reading his telegram. At this time of national crisis and people's suffering, if we do not have peaceful unification, how can we ensure domestic tranquility, resist foreign aggression, seek survival, and save lives? Baichuan, if you have any suggestions for the overall situation, you can offer them to the central government. We will adopt anything that is good. Why use military force to harm the country and the people? I deeply admire your love for the Party-state. If you can correct Baichuan and rein him in at the brink, then your benevolent words will benefit everyone, and the whole country will receive favor. I hope you will give this your serious consideration. I cannot express my anticipation enough in this telegram. (Special Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liang Ruzhou arrived in Beiping this afternoon and did not express much. He plans to return to Jinming tomorrow to report. (Special Telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Advisor</h3>
<p>Report on Inspecting the Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mentor, an advisor to the Ministry of Railways, compiled a report on inspecting the situation of the Jiaoji Railway. 1. The railway still retains the old habits from when it was managed by Germans. The freight rates for materials such as bituminous coal exported from Qingdao are extremely low, while the export rates for agricultural products are not reduced, which is insufficient to promote the development of industry and commerce along the railway. 2. The purchase price of coal used by the railway's adjacent coal mines is as high as six yuan and one jiao per ton, which is too high. Moreover, the annual consumption of coal is about 20,000 tons, which is a huge waste. 3. The original funds used were also wasted too much. 4. After the unification of railway administration, the Jiaoji Railway can only be used as a branch line. 5. The Boshan Private Railway Company specializes in transporting coal. The length of the railway is 18 kilometers, and the capital is 2.4 million. The Jiaoji Railway should pay for it and buy it, incorporating it into the railway. (22nd)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The New French Cabinet</h3>
<p>The current reorganization of the French cabinet is very different from the previous reorganizations. The frequent collapses of the previous French cabinets were due to the instability of political parties and the lack of unity. The power of the conservative party was still present, so although they collapsed frequently, political power sometimes fell into the hands of the conservatives. Now, looking at the new cabinet, Prime Minister Chautemps belongs to the Radical Socialist Party. The Radical Socialist Party, which has joined the new cabinet, has a total of ten members in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. There is one member of the Republican Socialist Party and four members of the Left Radical Party. No right-wing parties based on socialism have joined. Therefore, among the sixteen members of the new cabinet, almost all belong to the left wing. It can be said to be a purely left-wing cabinet.</p>
<p>The various left-wing parties in France are based on the Socialist Party as their backbone. The organization was established earlier. The party was established as early as 1880. However, its internal divisions soon split into several parties, failing to unite. As a result, the right wing often had the upper hand. However, in recent times, the left wing has gradually progressed and become more left-leaning. After the previous Poincaré cabinet fell, the left wing wanted to rise and replace it. However, it was still obtained by the right-wing Tardieu, while the left wing still wanted to achieve its goal of forming a cabinet and confronted Tardieu. It used fiscal problems to criticize him. Therefore, Tardieu's fall and Chautemps' succession were actually the result of the trends of the left and right wings.</p>
<p>It is not random or without reason. The French conservative newspapers predict that the new cabinet will not last long. The radical newspapers claim that with the support of the Socialist Party, they will surely have a majority in the National Assembly. As for how long it will last, we will see later.</p>
<p>I have always said that the political trends of various countries in recent times are mostly caused by the struggle between the radical and moderate factions. The British Prime Minister's departure from the Labor Party was due to the abundance of left-leaning members. The parliamentary brawl in Poland arose from a dispute between left-wing and other factions. In addition, there have been frequent problems in the political situations of various countries due to the radical actions of the left-wing parties. It is not just the change in the French cabinet.</p>

<p>Japanese General Election</p>
<h3>Results of Several Days of Vote Counting</h3>
<p>The Government and Party Gain a Significant Advantage. The Number of Proletarian Elected is Less Than 10%. Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. The results of yesterday's general election show that the Minseito party has a decisive advantage. Regarding this issue,</p>
<p>a member of the House of Peers said that the Minseito's advantage shows that popular sentiment has not waned, and wishes the current cabinet to continue. The fact that many Seiyukai candidates received the second-highest number of votes is proof of insufficient financial resources.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency. As of noon today, the vote counting results show that the Seiyukai elder, Hajime Tada, is nearing despair, and former Agriculture Minister Yamamoto is also quite pessimistic. The Seiyukai is not as excited as in the past, saying that this is the result of government suppression and is extremely indignant.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, after 30 days of hard fighting, waited for good news, listening intently to reports flying in from all directions, and ordered wine and food to be prepared to drink with party executives to celebrate. Reports from Tokyo and Osaka were all favorable to his party, and the Prime Minister was especially pleased.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd. As of 1:30 AM on the 23rd, the number of votes obtained by each party in the Japanese general election is as follows: Minseito 262, Seiyukai 165, Doshikai 6, Kakushinto 2, Shamin Party 2, Ta眾 Party 2, Rōnō Party 1, Neutral 5, Total 445. The telegrams for 21 positions have not yet arrived, so the results are unknown, but it is a confirmed fact that the Minseito has won more than half of the seats.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency. Mizutani, the former member of parliament for the first district of Kyoto, and Dr. Kawakami Hajime, as well as Sasako Kanemitsu from the second district, were all proletarian fighters who unfortunately lost the election. This was due to ignoring the agreement on constituencies and the proliferation of candidates, resulting in comrades fighting each other, which is self-defeating. Abe Isoo and Suzuki Bunji also lost the election. Fortunately, Nishio Suehiro was elected in the third district of Osaka, which gave the Social Democratic Party some breathing room. Oyama Ikuo, the leader of the Rōnō Party, who aroused the masses with his eloquence, was also elected, ranking fifth among twelve candidates. Matsuya Yojiro of the Ta众 Party was also elected, which added luster to the proletarian parties. However, Kato Kanju, Sakai Toshihiko, and Nakanishi Inosuke, who all had hopes of being elected, were defeated. Thus, out of 95 proletarian candidates nationwide, the number elected as of yesterday was less than 10%. The only remaining hopes are Asahara and Kamei in Kyushu. If this is all, not only will they be unable to influence the two parties, but this emerging force will also have a major deficiency.</p>
<p>▲ Japan Allied Press. The expected number of proletarian candidates to be elected was 12 or 13. However, the results of the vote counting led to their defeat. The fundamental reasons for the proletarian parties' defeat are not only that the mutual opposition and infighting were even more complicated than in the previous election, but also that the government party had meticulous plans. As for the right-wing Social Democratic Party, it has weakened its class struggle spirit and lacks the courage to confront the established political parties head-on, which is most regrettable. We can see from the defeat of the Social Democratic Party leader Abe Isoo and party executive Suzuki Bunji, and the election of the extreme left-wing Rōnō Party leader Oyama Ikuo, that Oyama's fervent fighting spirit moved the masses and resulted in such unexpected results.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Briand, Finance Minister Dumont, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Steeg, Minister of the Navy Sarraut, Minister of the Army Pétain, Minister of Public Works Durand, Minister of Education Daladier, Minister of Colonial Affairs Penancier, Minister of the Merchant Marine Daranio. The cabinet has a total of 16 members.</p>
<p>Four are former senators, all affiliated with the Radical Socialist Party. Twelve are former members of the Chamber of Deputies, including six affiliated with the Radical Socialist Party, one with the Republican Socialist Party, four with the Left Radical Party, and one with the Democratic Party. Chautemps' new cabinet will attend parliament on Monday and request a vote of confidence at the same time. As the new cabinet is entirely based on the Socialist Party, the right-wing refused to join, so conservative newspapers predict that its lifespan will be short. However, Radical Party newspapers claim that with the support of the Socialist Party, the new cabinet can secure at least a 20-vote majority in parliament.</p>
<p>▲Guomin News Agency, London, 21st. French Prime Minister Chautemps notified British Prime Minister MacDonald that Foreign Minister Briand will be the chief representative of France at the naval conference, and will be assisted by Minister of the Navy Sarraut, Minister of the Merchant Marine Daranio, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Penancier. Sarraut was the former attendee of the Washington Naval Conference.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Disarmament Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Special Vessels</p>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, London, 21st. The Disarmament Conference Preparatory Committee met at St. James's Palace at 4:00 PM on the 21st. As a result of discussions among the experts from various countries, it was unanimously decided: (1) Ships not subject to limitations will be distinguished according to the decisions of the Geneva Conference; (2) Special vessels, seaplanes, transport ships, and training ships, etc., will be limited in their strength to the extent of recognizing existing forces; (3) When building replacement ships, they will not be included in the types of light cruisers and destroyers, etc., but will be included in the ships not subject to limitations; (4) Special vessels will be removed from the classification of ship types in the future. At the same time, it was decided that all expert members except France would meet again on the 22nd to draft a report and report to the First Committee. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Spain Changing to a Republic</h3>
<p>Former Prime Minister's Son Willing to Support ▲Reuters News Agency, Madrid, 21st. The son of former Prime Minister Maura, a prominent Spanish Conservative leader, gave a speech today, stating, "If anyone raises the flag of the republic,</p>
<p>I am willing to follow him." These words have shaken the political world. The various political parties preparing for the upcoming election are gradually realizing that the issue of democracy is bound to arise and will become a strong factor influencing the number of election votes. It is now important to know the attitude towards the political system of Dr. Cula, the former conservative prime minister who was imprisoned under the dictatorship. He is a monarchist, but his loyalty to King Alfonso is highly questionable, so people urgently want to hear his important speech to be delivered next Thursday.</p>
<h3>Soviet Farmers Subject to Great Oppression</h3>
<p>Livestock Decreases Sharply... Meat Shortage ▲Reuters News Agency, Riga, 21st. Since the Soviet Central Executive Committee decided that wealthy peasants in all areas where the public ownership system has been established must be expelled and their property must be confiscated, the oppression of farmers is now intensifying.</p>
<p>This is the result of the policies under Stalin's Five-Year Plan. Ordinary farmers slaughter their cattle and sheep, etc., and eat them themselves before joining collective farms. In the lower reaches of the Volga River and within the Caucasus region, livestock has been reduced by half in the past few months. Russian farmers near the Persian border are driving cattle and sheep into Persia and selling them, which clearly violates the orders of the Soviet authorities.</p>
<p>Meat in cities is now in severe shortage. The people of Moscow are quite dissatisfied because the authorities have decided to have ten vegetarian days per month.</p>
<h3>Tariff on American Dried Eggs Doubles</h3>
<p>Our Country is Uniquely Affected ▲Associated Press, Washington, 21st. The Senate considered the tariff bill today and adopted Howell's motion to increase the dried egg tax from 18 cents to 36 cents. This measure will not affect foreign exporters except for China. Thus, the agricultural section of the new tariff bill has been completed.</p>
<p>Prussian Parliament</p>
<h3>Motion of No Confidence in the Prime Minister Defeated</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 21st. After two days of heated debate, the Prussian Parliament defeated the motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Braun by a vote of 217 to 198. This motion was proposed by the Economic Party because Braun appointed Gremm, a Social Democrat, as Minister of Education. Members of the National People's Party also joined the Economic Party in conspiring to overthrow the cabinet because Braun instructed the Prussian representatives in the Federal Council to support the Young Plan.</p>
<h3>Rapid Development of Wireless Telephone</h3>
<p>Satisfactory Results in Trials Between Britain and Australia. London Gradually Becoming the World's Central Hub ▲Reuters News Agency, London, 21st. Wireless telephone is now developing very rapidly, and London is gradually becoming the world's central hub. The telephone connection between Britain and Australia has had satisfactory trial success, and soon the official agency will announce that the British and Australian telephone systems will be available for public use. Yesterday, the post office opened a new business of direct telephone connections between London and the Papal State of Rome. Britain is now able to talk to ships at sea, and soon there will be new conveniences for mutual conversations between telephone bureaus and major merchant ships. A year ago, there was only one telephone line between Britain and the United States, but due to the great increase in business, there are now four lines, but they are still insufficient. Securities brokers and other merchants have recognized that transatlantic telephone calls are a necessary aid to business, so the number of users is gradually increasing, currently at 1,000 times per day.</p>
<h3>Riot Case of Australian Miners</h3>

A total of 72 workers involved in the incident were detained and sent to court for prosecution. Today, the court sentenced 68 people, each fined a certain amount, with the maximum being 18 pounds. Three of them were sentenced to three months in prison for harming others.</p>

<h3>The Central Propaganda Department Issues a Letter to Fellow Countrymen</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Based on the above phenomena, our party deeply realizes that the suffering of our compatriots has reached its limit, and we absolutely cannot allow the oppressive feudal forces to seize the opportunity to rise again. The people must obtain an opportunity to rest and recuperate, and the country must achieve a position of freedom and equality. The only strategy is peace and unification, because only peace can restore the vitality of society, and only unification can establish the authority of the state. Peaceful unification is the fundamental policy set by the Central Government based on the actual needs of the people. Those who vigorously implement this policy are friends of the people, and those who violate this policy are enemies of the people. The test of whether or not this policy is supported is whether or not they obey the Central Government. The remaining feudal forces also know how to call for peace and unification, but when asked about the methods to achieve peace and unification, they do not obey the Central Government but resist it.</p>
<p>For example, if party affairs are resolved by party members and national affairs are resolved by the people, then peaceful unification can also be achieved. The absurdity and folly of this has been widely denounced by contemporary scholars.</p>
<p>The aim of our party's revolution is to restore the inherent glory of the Chinese nation externally and to create a society where civil rights are extended and the people's livelihood is happy internally.</p>
<p>In other words, our party's actions are based on the dictates of the Three Principles of the People,</p>
<p>to make China a truly of the people, by the people, for the people. Therefore, the party and the country are inseparable for a moment. If we try to resolve national affairs apart from the Kuomintang, we will inevitably seek advice from the remnants of the imperial system, reactionary warlords, and communist bandits, who have already been rejected by the people, allowing them to return to the political stage and re-enact the old dramas of the Zhang Xun and Cao Kun eras, as well as the chaos caused by He Long and Ye Ting, adding even more painful material to the lives of the people. If they say that there are other ways, then there is no satisfactory way except to re-employ Yang Du and others to plan another "constitutional security." It is a pity that in today's China, even with Yuan Shikai's wisdom and talent, he could not sit securely in the South, let alone those below the rank of monks. Since this theory is untenable, they reverse their course and say that "courtesy" will govern the country and that they will resign together.</p>
<p>This is also a way to promote the success of unification. Their idea, centered on personal rights and status, unconsciously exposes their face as emperors behind closed doors. The central government is the common property of the people, and those who hold positions in the central government are all public servants of the people. Individuals themselves only have obligations to fulfill,</p>
<p>and no rights to enjoy. The propriety of their service can only be judged by revolutionary principles, and cannot be measured by hypocritical courtesy. Those who are wholeheartedly for the party and the country, even if they want to leave, the people will not allow it. Those who destroy the party and mislead the country,</p>
<p>even if they do not want to leave, will eventually be overthrown by the people. As for asking revolutionary comrades to resign together because of their own mistakes, this is truly an unprecedented strange story of seeking peaceful unification. If we carefully observe the positive side of the facts, we will know that all those who defy the central government and boast of peaceful unification are gnashing their teeth and preparing to use the blood and bones of the people to fill their own pockets. The feudal forces entrenched between the central government and the people, on the one hand, exploit the local areas through the central government, and on the other hand, threaten the central government through the local areas. Therefore, they also falsely claim peaceful unification to conceal their lawless and unscrupulous crimes. If we want to break down the obstacles between the central government and the people, we must realize genuine peaceful unification. Now the remaining feudal forces, seeing that the policy of peaceful unification is unfavorable to their habit of partitioning territory and exploiting the people, have repeatedly risen up in resistance and embarked on the path of rebellion. In order to implement the policy of peaceful unification, which is the same for the interests of the country and the people, the central government has sincerely advised and exhorted all rebellions that have been hidden and not yet erupted. This is called "stopping chaos." For rebellions that have erupted and cannot be stopped, they will be suppressed in accordance with the demands of the people. This is called "suppressing chaos." At the same time, for the remaining feudal forces that have repeatedly created rebellions,</p>
<p>we hope that they will recognize the demands of the times, turn over a new leaf, and eliminate feudal ideology invisibly. This is called "pacifying chaos." Those feudal remnants who have failed to truly understand the environment and wishes of the people are resolutely seeking only their own personal rights, and they recklessly speculate on the minds of those who bear the great mission of the revolution, thinking that the era of the Beijing warlord government's rule,</p>
<p>all disputes arose from personal rights. If there is a declaration of resignation, it will be a way to shirk one's own responsibility. They do not know that today's government</p>
<p>is a revolutionary government. Those who serve in the revolutionary government have already dedicated their own rights and freedoms to the party and the country. The task of the party and the country has not been completed, and even if they exhaust themselves, they cannot refuse. Moreover, at a time when the powers are still causing disturbances and the people have not been liberated, there is still concern that the struggle and sacrifice will not last long, let alone resign.</p>
<p>If they think that they can do whatever they want simply by being in a high position, it is tantamount to making light of the important trust of the country and the people, and there is little chance that they will not increase the chaos. From this, it can be seen that only those who inherit Premier Sun's teachings and the historical mission of our party are qualified to talk about pacifying chaos. Only those who consistently obey the orders of the party and the country are qualified to talk about suppressing chaos. Only those who deeply know the urgency of the people's suffering and the country's peril, and sincerely plan for construction, are qualified to talk about stopping chaos. Those who appear to be respectful but act treacherously are not qualified to talk about this. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>People of Huaiyang</h3>
<p>Request Dredging of Zhangfu Canal People from various counties in Huaiyang, in view of the fact that the counties have suffered from droughts and floods for many years and that famine has been frequent, feel that the discussion of guiding the Huai River cannot be delayed. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by the financial resources of the counties and provinces alone. The national government is also facing practical difficulties, and the commencement of dredging will have to wait. However, the Zhangfu Canal, which is most closely related to the counties under the jurisdiction of the two, has been in disrepair for many years, and the riverbed is silted up and shallow. If it can be dredged, the source will be abundant, and the counties will benefit greatly, and it will be easier to implement.</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, a meeting was specially held at the transport office of the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association in the town. Representatives from the counties attended, including Wang Chengding, Tian Yufan, and Lu Zhongying from Huaian, Ding Yinmei, Li Xilin, Jiang Zengji, and Chen Shizhou from Huaiyin, Bao Youke, Wang Dingyi, Liu Zhongxuan, and Zhou Xiji from Baoying, Wang Shouyi, Xu Yao, and Zhang from Gaoyou, Zheng Guanxi from Yancheng, Yang Zhiyun from Funing, Li Zenglin, Liu Yuyao, and Xu Zhaoding from Jiangdu, Shi Mingyong from Xinghua, and Cheng Jingsheng, Zhu Yan, and Lu Dianhu, members of the Relief Association. Cheng Jingsheng was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported briefly that he had met with the representatives in recent days and generally believed that dredging the Zhangfu Canal</p>
<p>is the only good strategy for relieving the disaster in northern Jiangsu. In recent years, there has been drought,</p>
<p>the local financial resources have been depleted, and residents have died one after another, and life has been cut off. If the river is not treated and relief is not provided, then the fertile land of Huaiyang</p>
<p>will become barren land like Gansu and Shaanxi. Our association is of a temporary nature,</p>
<p>and it has decided to close after the spring relief. What will happen if we are unfortunately afflicted by another famine?</p>
<p>For the sake of fundamental treatment, we should urgently plan to dredge the Zhangfu Canal. Our association has been entrusted by you to repeatedly appeal to the provincial government, and I also proposed it once at the provincial relief meeting. The members believed that it was an urgent matter, and the Department of Reconstruction also advocated this action and is currently reviewing it. The Department of Finance promised to raise funds as much as possible, and the Huai River Guidance Association also has the idea of holding it urgently. This is something that we cannot help but be grateful for. But you are representatives of public opinion and should rise up and work together to plan it. As for how to start construction, the provincial government should be asked to quickly invite the departments of construction, finance, and civil affairs to handle it, and so on. After discussion by the representatives, it was decided: (1) To establish the Zhangfu Canal Dredging Promotion Association immediately. (2) To go to the various departments of the provincial government to petition immediately. (3) To appoint Bao, Wang, and Li as representatives to express their opinions when petitioning. After the meeting was adjourned, they went to the various departments of the provincial government to petition together. They met Chairman Niu and Director He, as well as other heads of departments, who all agreed to submit it to the provincial government meeting next Tuesday. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Capital Promotes National Goods Movement</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Capital National Goods Promotion Movement Conference</p>
<p>(22nd) at 9:00 AM today was held at the Zhenjiang Public Stadium. A total of more than 10,000 people from the provincial party headquarters, the provincial government, the Department of Education, the Department of Reconstruction, the Department of Agriculture and Mining, the Department of Finance, the Police Academy, and various civic groups attended. Zhang Daofan, the provincial party affairs reorganization committee member, was publicly elected as the chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported briefly that we are holding the National Goods Promotion Movement Conference in the pouring rain, and many compatriots have come to the meeting to participate. Such enthusiasm is enough to show the revolutionary spirit of our people. After the recent problem of expensive gold and cheap silver occurred, the national economy of the whole country has been seriously threatened. Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to promote national goods. It has been found that our country has to outflow tens of thousands of yuan in trade every year.</p>
<p>Now that gold is expensive and silver is cheap, the number is more than that. I hope that all compatriots will use national goods together to save the poverty and weakness of the country and to help the national crisis, and so on. Afterwards, representatives made speeches one after another, and the two telegrams were passed and the slogans were shouted before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>[Planning the Construction of the Xiaochang Light Railway]</p>
<p>Cheng Zhenjun, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Construction, proposed at the 293rd meeting of the Provincial Government Committee to change the Xiaochang Highway into the Xiaochang Light Railway, requesting a public decision. The proposal was approved. The original proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Upon investigation, the Xiaochang Highway is planned to be handled by the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau of Zhejiang Province, and the section from Xiaoshan to Zhuji will be built first. The Provincial Government Committee has successively proposed and decided this in meetings, and immediately ordered the bureau to comply. The bureau should start construction immediately to comply with the original proposal. However, the entire route is very long, passing through densely populated areas with abundant products. In addition to passenger transport,</p>
<p>it is necessary to take into account freight transport in order to fulfill the main purpose of transportation. After repeated consideration by this department, it is believed that building highways is beneficial for short-distance passenger transport, but uneconomical for long-distance freight and passenger transport. If a railway is built, it would be difficult to raise funds and start construction. After repeated planning, it seems most appropriate to rebuild a light railway, which requires less cost and has broader benefits. The advantages of light railways compared to highways are listed below: (1)</p>
<p>The construction cost of a light railway, including vehicles and equipment, is about 11,000 yuan per *huali* (Chinese mile), while the construction cost of a highway, including vehicles and equipment, is about 8,000 yuan per *huali*. The current cost of various highways is also more than 10,000 yuan. The difference in cost between the two is not significant, but the maintenance cost after the railway is built is very low, and its service life is also longer. (2) The transport capacity of a light railway is larger, with an average of about 400 passengers and 200 tons of goods per train. Highways have smaller carrying capacity and cannot provide long-distance transportation. (3) Railway vehicles are durable, with an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years, while automobiles can only last a maximum of 5 years. (4) The fuel used for railways is coal, and the main materials are steel, both of which can be obtained domestically. The fuel used for automobiles is gasoline, and the main materials are tires, etc., all of which must be purchased from abroad. Furthermore, the Zhengtai narrow-gauge railway is very developed, and the Uekawa Light Railway has also been successfully operated. Others include</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The light railway of the Liujiang Coal Mine Company, where each train can carry 18 carriages and 180 tons of goods, with each carriage carrying 30 to 40 passengers, is much more convenient than highways. Using that as an example, if the Chang Road can be converted into a light railway, future income will definitely increase. In addition to the budget for this item, which will be proposed separately in the future, this matter concerns a change to an established plan. Is it feasible? It is appropriate to submit a proposal in advance for public decision."</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Government's Opinions on Land Tax Clearance</h3>
<p>▲Advocating for temporary measures first to prepare for fundamental solutions ▲Then gradually improving towards thorough reorganization. Changsha Correspondence: The Ministry of Finance recently approved a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee forwarding a request from the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee to the Central Government, requesting the National Government to issue a clear order for a nationwide land tax clearance. It specially copied and forwarded the original request to the Hunan Provincial Government for review and reply. The Hunan Provincial Government yesterday specifically responded in detail on various measures for both temporary and fundamental solutions, for consideration. The reply is as follows: "Regarding the reply, your ministry's letter was approved. The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee forwarded a submission from the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, stating that the 11th branch of the 9th district party department under the committee requested to forward to the Central Government a request for the National Government to issue a clear order for a nationwide land tax clearance. The original request was copied and forwarded, instructing review and reply, etc. Upon investigation, the original request considers land tax clearance as an urgent matter to relieve the suffering of the people and enrich the national treasury, which is indeed a profound argument. It also considers land survey as the key to starting clearance, which is also a plan for fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>However, since the Qin and Han dynasties, the beginning of free buying and selling of land opened the door for reclamation and annexation, resulting in private ownership. Repeated changes have created a long history.</p>
<p>Therefore, registers are scattered and untraceable. A sudden land survey cannot be successful overnight. In addition, the military affairs in the Northwest and Western Guangdong have not been settled,</p>
<p>and bandits are rampant in remote border areas. Residents and travelers still lack safety. Moreover, this matter is significant, requiring leaders, surveyors, planning time, handling costs, and legal maintenance. All</p>
<p>these points should be carefully considered and prepared in advance. Hastily attempting it will inevitably lead to waste and little success. This is why this government has repeatedly deliberated and believes that land survey may not be timely until the disbandment has ended and pacification has concluded. However, the tax system has become extremely chaotic today. Knowing that it is impossible but not acting may lead to no hope of success. Therefore, temporary measures must be taken first to prepare for fundamental solutions,</p>
<p>and then gradually improved towards thorough reorganization. The first priority of temporary measures is thorough investigation. The method of thorough investigation is to first dispatch personnel to collect outstanding taxes from each county according to the amount due, with a deadline for collection and remittance. All issues such as less land and more taxes, more land and less taxes, land without taxes, and taxes without land, as well as the true names and addresses of taxpayers, land locations, quantity of land, tax amounts, and different classes should be investigated and recorded in detail during the thorough investigation. Registration forms should be stipulated and separately detailed. It is also necessary to strictly order each county not to deduct cash with grain coupons before raising funds for any item, to avoid deficits and misappropriation, and to limit surcharges to avoid affecting regular supplies. Strictly prohibit contracted collections to prevent clerks from enriching themselves, and prevent free allocations to avoid disrupting tax administration. The above are all positive temporary measures as the first step towards fundamental solutions, which is also what the original request called for: investigation, registration, and price reporting, all of which must be carried out step by step. This government has already included the thorough investigation of land tax and land acreage in its political program and is planning to gradually implement it. However, the accumulated malpractices are too deep, and there are no concrete measures yet. We are eagerly awaiting your ministry's prompt promulgation of good regulations to comply with. Given the previous reasons, we have accordingly expressed our humble opinions for consideration. Please bother to investigate and deal with it. One."</p>
<h3>Conclusion of Debate in Xue Diankui Case</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The second hearing of the case against Shou Zhang Xue Diankui for counter-revolution was held at 3 p.m. on the 19th in the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Shandong High Court. Those present included Zhao Zhikui, President of the Criminal Court, judges Li Faxian and Wang Shicheng, prosecutor Liu Zhaofu,</p>
<p>clerk Fang Zhenhua, lawyer Ni Pifang, and many observers from the party department and the press. The questioning proceeded as follows: Court President Zhao Zhikui asked, "Are you Xue Diankui?" Xue answered, "Yes." "How old are you?" "Sixty-four years old." "Where are you from?" "Shou Chang, Henan." "What did you do before?" "Studied." "What were you doing before the crime?" "Chief of the preparatory regiment of the People's Self-Defense Force." "When was the preparatory regiment established?" "It was previously the guard regiment, established in the second year of the Republic of China, and changed to the self-defense force preparatory regiment in the 17th year. Chen Yishen, the commander-in-chief, appointed me as the chief of the entire county." "How many regiments are there in the entire county?" "Fourteen regiments north of the river and ten regiments south of the river." "How many people are in each regiment?" "Thirty or twenty, not equal." "Where does the funding come from?" "Donations are collected from upper, middle, and lower households based on land acreage, also not uniform." "Wasn't your conflict with the party department due to the budget in the 18th year? The police fee in the 18th year was two cents per *mu*, and the regiment fee was one cent and five *li*. Previously, the police fee was five *li* per *mu*, and the regiment fee was one cent. Was the conflict due to this?" "When I was the chief of the regiment, I didn't know about money matters." "Did you oppose the review committee and have disagreements with the party department?" "No." "Did you ever threaten the county magistrate with a gun?" "No." "Did you oppose the party department posting slogans and leaflets? There is evidence to this effect." (He then took out a photo and showed it to Xue Diankui.) "I have never scolded anyone. I don't know about this." "Is it because you have a feud with the party department that they wanted to abolish the regiment chief that the conflict arose?" "No, I am willing to resign, and have resigned several times." "Why resign?" "Because the farmers' association was established, and the two rascals Ge Panqin and Ge Wensheng intervened. I resigned for fear of accidents." "Do you oppose the Kuomintang?" "I don't oppose it." "Why did you conflict with the party department on July 9th?" "Wu, the district chief of Linqing, sent a letter</p>
<p>inviting me to Linqing for a meeting to discuss joint defense against bandits. I went to the yamen to see the county magistrate and on the way back, I encountered Han and Li from the party department under a locust tree in Xiaoyushou. They asked if I was carrying a gun. I replied that I was not carrying a gun. The two soldiers were also not carrying guns. Han and Li each carried a pistol and a Mauser." "Why were Han and Li wounded by gunfire?" "At this time, I had already passed by in front. They quarreled with my guards, and the guards snatched the gun." "Did you teach him to shoot?" "No, it was a misfire." "You don't need to prevaricate. A policeman saw and heard you teach him to shoot." "No, if I taught him to shoot, it would not have been just one shot. I even forbade him." "Did the county magistrate inspect after the shooting?" "Yes." "How did they attack the city later?" "Ge Panqin and Ge Wensheng left the city and invited the Red Spear Society to attack the city. These two were wanted by the Civil Affairs Department." "Were you in the city when the city was attacked, directing the shooting?" "No shots were fired in the city." "Where were they outside the city?" "They gathered more than 1,000 people near Nantai outside the city and drove away the original Nantai Self-Defense Force preparatory regiment." "How was Cai Guanghan, the chief of the regiment, kidnapped by them?" "Cai was the chief of the second regiment. Because he was old, he left the city to visit home and was kidnapped by them on the way through Nantai." "What happened later?" "The county magistrate sent the chief of the public security bureau and the president of the court to mediate twice. I even said that as long as Cai Guanghan was released, any conditions could be agreed to. They ultimately refused." "How did the men under Cai's command get to Tainan later? Did you teach them to go?" "No, his guards were eager to save their master and invited people to go." "How many people went?" "Thirty to forty people, mostly guards. They went on the evening of the tenth." "What was the result?" "Hou Zhaojin, a regiment member who went, was killed by them, and Cai Guanghan was beaten and hanged. He died after being rescued. Regiment member Xue Hongxun was killed while defending the city." "Who killed Shi Jiuqing, the secretary of the Farmers' Association Anti-Japanese Association and secretary of the party department, and four others?" "I don't know." "Was it because your relationship with the party department was too bad, and it became more intense after Han came out?"</p>
<p>"I dare not be intense." "How do you feel about the Kuomintang?" "Welcome. I was a member of the Kuomintang in the first year of the Republic of China and worked with Zhang Ruixuan. He was a friend of Sun Yat-sen. I also donated money when the party department was established." "Why is your relationship with the party department so bad?" "The party department was fooled by Ge Panqin and Ge Wensheng.</p>
<p>These two are rebels and bad people. They have now been expelled from the party.</p>
<p>Chairman Chen once arrested the two of them and Shen, the director of the Construction Bureau." "Do you oppose the Three Principles of the People?" "I don't oppose it. I am a member of the Min Party." At this point, the court president ordered Xue Diankui to step down and invited lawyer Ni Pifang to express his opinion. Ni stood up and said, "This case has been reviewed by your court for many days, and the questioning today has also been clarified. Please ask the prosecutor to express his opinion." Prosecutor Liu Zhaofu stood up and said,</p>
<p>"The details of this case have been stated clearly in the indictment. However, what Xue Diankui actually thinks of the Kuomintang is a question that must be paid attention to in order to determine whether or not he is a counter-revolutionary. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay attention to whether or not Xue Diankui has a feud with Ge Panqin and Ge Wensheng. Also, Xue Diankui should be responsible for the fact that five people were killed by the regiment members when he was the chief of the regiment." At this point, the court president asked Xue Diankui again, "Is your relationship with the party department bad?" "Not bad, I often go to the party department." "Do you oppose Ge Panqin and Ge Wensheng, or do you oppose the Kuomintang?"</p>
<p>"Oppose the two Ges, not the Kuomintang." "Did you fire guns in the city when they were fighting outside the city?" "No shots were fired in the city." At this point, the clerk read the confession and ordered Xue to sign it in court. Finally, Xue Diankui was asked again, "Do you have anything else to say?" "In short, I don't hate the party department." The court declared the debate in this case concluded and scheduled a date for sentencing, and then adjourned. (February 19)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Passes Through Tianjin to Return to Shenyang</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Mo Dehui, the superintendent of the Chinese Eastern Railway, was summoned to Beijing last month to discuss issues with Russia. After completing his affairs, he returned north. When he arrived in Jinan, Chen Tiaoyuan provided a special train for him to travel north. (Yesterday, the 18th) He left Jinan at 2:30 a.m. and arrived at Tianjin East Station around 9 p.m. The Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Command sent teams and bands to welcome him at the station. Garrison Commander Chuan Zuoyi and Brigade Commander Yuan Qingzeng also arrived at the station to welcome him. After the train stopped, Mo briefly mingled with the welcomers and then took Commander Chuan's car to Chuan's residence for dinner. Those traveling with him</p>
<p>included Wu Zesheng and Cai Yunchen, the Secretary-General of the Eastern Route. Mo's entourage of eleven people also got off the train and transferred to a chartered carriage provided by the Beining Railway, attached to the No. 105 passenger train to Shenyang. A reporter met Mo at Chuan's residence and asked about the central government's current policy towards Russia and the Northeast authorities' handling of the negotiations. Mo's remarks were as follows: "The central government's policy towards the Eastern Route has been declared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Some clauses in the draft agreement of the Khabarovsk Conference exceed the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current dispute is over the Eastern Route, and the representative authority of Cai Yunsheng is also limited to discussing the scope of the Eastern Route. Other general Sino-Russian issues are beyond Cai's authority to discuss, and the Northeast authorities have no power to resolve them. Therefore, the central government has declared that it does not recognize the draft agreement signed by Cai beyond his authority, except for those pertaining to the Eastern Route. The Russian goal is also to restore the Eastern Route to its state before July, and they should not invoke the draft agreement and make other demands.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration was issued, the Russians have not had any reaction. This is because the national spirit of our country cannot be humiliated, and the international community would also not approve. The central government has appointed me to go to Russia this time to attend the meeting. I tried my best to decline, but due to my responsibilities, I could not help but force myself to do so. I will use my loyalty to the country and a fearless spirit to negotiate. If the Russians make any threats, I will never yield. The authority granted to me by the central government is also limited to discussing the Eastern Route issue, that is, to continue and</p>
<p>resolve the problem by seeking to continue implementing the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement. The Fengtian Agreement stipulates that our country can unconditionally recover the Eastern Route after sixty years, and can also redeem it at a price before the deadline. However, how to evaluate it and how to pay for it, and whether it can be redeemed with bonds, will all be discussed at this meeting. Also, before the redemption, a most fair method of joint management should be discussed to avoid further disputes. This dispute was caused by unfairness. If the Russians want to avoid future disputes, they should be happy to discuss joint management methods with us. After I return to Liaoning, I still have to go to Harbin to handle various matters, and I will not be able to depart for Russia until mid-March. Experts sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Railways will also travel with me for consultation. The Northeast authorities have worked hard to deal with the Eastern Route issue this time. They know that the strength of the Northeast is not enough to</p>
<p>oppose the strength of Russia, but forced to fight for the face of the country and the personality of the nation, they had to send troops to resist the enemy. However, the country is becoming more and more difficult, internal wars are breaking out one after another, and a certain country is trying to take the opportunity to stir up trouble. The 100,000 troops of the Eastern Province have been exposed for half a year, and public and private losses are difficult to estimate. The Russian bandits are deepening their penetration, and more than ten counties along the border have been ravaged by them, and they are about to cross the Xing'an Mountains to the east. A Soviet government has been organized in Hulunbuir. The South Allied Mongolian Youth League wants to communize various places in Manzhouli. The people of various counties along the border are crying out for help, asking the authorities to resolve the dispute as soon as possible. Therefore, there was the initial consultation in Shuangchengzi. At that time, it was reported that the Russians were demanding compensation for military expenses from our side,</p>
<p>and stationed troops to protect the railway. Fortunately, this did not materialize, so there was the Khabarovsk meeting. Although Cai Yunsheng made some mistakes, if you think back to the difficulties at the time, there are many things that can be understood. Those who do not know the content are only demanding on paper, which is far from the facts. Now that the central government has denied a part of it, it is enough to remedy it," and so on. Mo and his party left Tianjin at 12 p.m. last night on the Tongpu Railway,</p>
<p>and Commander Chuan and others still went to the station to see them off in person. (19th)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Rectifies the Judiciary</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Liaoning Provincial Government member Liu Heling and others recently proposed to rectify the judiciary in the province and drafted six measures. The 91st meeting of the Provincial Committee approved the proposal and reported it to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for instructions. The Political Affairs Committee has now instructed that it be filed for record. The original proposal and measures are excerpted as follows: (1) Supervise personnel administration. The appointment and removal of judicial officials should be handled in accordance with regulations. The Provincial Government has the power to supervise the judiciary. In the future, the appointment, removal, or transfer of local court presidents, chief procurators, ordinary prosecutors, and clerks should be reported to the Provincial Government by the High Court and the relevant department for verification.</p>
<p>Those who have been appointed or transferred in the past should also be investigated and reported by the court for approval in accordance with the procedures. (2) Investigate courts and prisons. Recently, local courts in the province have been slow, biased, and prone to bribery and solicitation in handling civil and criminal cases. Therefore, there have been many cases of people complaining to the government. Prisons and detention centers definitely engage in arbitrary extortion of prisoners and prolonged detention without resolution. People outside are talking about it. If this is not actively rectified, it will lead to criticism both internally and externally.</p>
<p>The High Court and its Procuratorate should be instructed to thoroughly rectify the situation. At the same time, the Provincial Government should appoint personnel familiar with judicial and prison administration to go to various places to conduct thorough investigations for verification and handling. (3) Strictly prohibit manipulation of sentences. In criminal cases, the principal penalty is broad. Judges should use their conscience to determine the sentence and must not manipulate it based on private intentions to avoid suspicion of breaking the law. The High Court and the Procuratorate should be instructed to strictly investigate their subordinates. If anyone loses or gains in criminal cases, they should be immediately subject to disciplinary action. If anyone intentionally manipulates it, they should be prosecuted for dereliction of duty under Article 133 of the Criminal Law. (4) Maintain judges' salaries. Judges have complex affairs,</p>
<p>and their salaries have always been low, which is not enough to reward them and cultivate their integrity. The High Court and its Procuratorate should be instructed to give priority to judges' and clerks' salaries within the budget scope and not to reduce or delay payment. All judicial surplus funds should not be used to add new agencies for the time being, but should first be used to actively rectify existing courts and prisons to avoid simply expanding and increasing the name while actually being perfunctory and exhausted. (5) Report judicial income and expenditure. The Provincial Government has no record of how much of the provincial judicial expenses are supplemented by judicial income in addition to the fixed amount of 200,000 yuan from the province each year, and what the total judicial income is for the year. The High Court and its Procuratorate should be instructed to prepare a detailed statement of the annual income for verification to clarify the situation. In the future, if there is a surplus in judicial income, it should not be requested to be retained unless there is an urgent need to show restriction. (6) Remove restrictions on the number of lawyers. The number of lawyers in this province has always been limited (about 50), which is unreasonable. The number is very small, which is enough to create a special opportunity for lawyers within the quota, resulting in extortion and monopoly, and litigants feel quite painful. The High Court and the Procuratorate should be instructed to remove this prohibition, allowing lawyers to register and operate freely at any time. However, if anyone does not abide by the rules of lawyers, the chief procurator of each locality should be instructed to strictly investigate and punish them. If there are any lawyers who secretly collude with judges, the judges should be punished,</p>
<p>otherwise, the responsible official will be held accountable. (17th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Civil and Education Department Heads Take Office</h3>
<p>▲Chen Mingshu presided over the oath and delivered a speech. Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Zeng Jian, the provincial committee member and director of the Civil Affairs Department, resigned from all his concurrent positions, the central government immediately issued an order appointing Huang Jusu as a member of the provincial government, Xu Chongqing, the former member of the provincial committee, as the director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Jin Zengcheng as the director of the Education Department. After the three received their letters of appointment, they took office in the provincial government today (15th). The meeting was held at around 8 a.m. After the newly appointed provincial committee member Huang Jusu, Civil Affairs Department Director Xu Chongqing, and Education Department Director Jin Zengcheng took their oaths in turn, the oath-taking official Chen Mingshu delivered a speech, saying, "Today I represent the central government to deliver a speech to the three of you. But the three of you are all comrades who are familiar to me. The speech is always the same, so there is nothing to say. As for the three of you, everyone knows about your party history and work, so there is no need to introduce you again. The three of you are far superior to me in learning and talent. It is a happy thing that you can all come to serve Guangdong today. As for myself, since taking over provincial affairs, I originally wanted to immediately build Guangdong into a model province, but things did not go as planned. In the past year, wars have repeatedly broken out in the province, so that all the strength of the provincial government has been directed towards military affairs, and no construction projects can be implemented. I am truly sorry. Now that the enemies have been destroyed to some extent, they have not yet been completely eliminated. Fortunately, the war has shifted to Guangxi. However, due to historical and economic relations between the two Guangs, Guangdong cannot be at peace unless Guangxi is settled. Therefore, the current government is still working hard on military affairs, hoping that the military affairs in Guangxi will end soon. The sooner the military affairs in Guangxi end, the sooner the construction of Guangdong will be realized. I hope everyone understands this. The people should fully assist the government in resolving the Guangxi issue. The people of Guangdong are inherently creative. If the military affairs end, it is expected that there will be remarkable construction projects. The people and the government should be of one mind and work towards one goal in today's environment to accomplish the great mission for the party and the country," and so on. After the speech, Huang, Xu, and Jin each gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at around 11 a.m. It is heard that Director Jin has already taken office and started work today, while Director Xu is scheduled to start work at the Civil Affairs Department on the 17th.

<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>The Pudong gang robbed two towns in one day. The towns of Nanbeiqiao and Weijing, under the jurisdiction of the county, were robbed by a gang of 60 to 70 bandits from Pudong at 11 a.m. on the 21st, who arrived in 13 boats. The bandits were all armed with Mauser pistols and fast rifles. They immediately robbed more than ten shops, including Tang Dongmao's shop, and stole the guns from the water police boats stationed in the town. At the same time, the bandits spread out as sentries around the town, firing guns to intimidate and kill one person and wound two people, including water police inspector Li Liang.</p>
<p>The robbery lasted for four hours, and the bandits then took the loot and boarded the boats, heading towards Yangcheng Lake. Yesterday, the sixth police station of the county public security bureau reported the incident to the county public security bureau and then reported it to the county government. The gang also robbed the town of Wutangjing after robbing Weijingtang Town. They landed at about 6 p.m. and used Mauser pistols to intimidate the 11th outpost of the public security bureau. The reserve policeman Li Yunqing was shot and injured. The outpost was unable to resist due to insufficient strength.</p>
<p>The bandits then split up and robbed for about an hour before taking the loot and boarding the boats, heading towards Yangcheng Lake again. The total monetary loss is about 10,000 yuan. The Wu County Government and the 3rd District of the Water Public Security Bureau have dispatched teams to the countryside to pursue the bandits after receiving the report.</p>

Zhang Yilun, the director of the Second District, went to the township to inspect the scene and provided 20 yuan for medical expenses.</p>
<p>He also sent a police inspector from the public security bureau to accompany her to Shanghai Guangren Hospital for treatment. She died in the hospital on the 19th due to her serious injuries. After Yu received the news, he claimed the body and prepared the coffin. However, because his family is extremely poor and he has two young children who are still breastfeeding, he requested Director Zhang to grant a pension to help him make a living. After receiving the request, Director Zhang has written to the officer in charge of the team to consider granting it. It is not known whether his wish will be fulfilled.</p>

They drank too much and staggered home. However, Zhu waited until dawn but the two sons did not return home. He asked at the Zhang family's residence, and was told that they had left together at ten o'clock. Zhu became extremely anxious, fearing they had accidentally fallen into the river and drowned after getting drunk. He searched the river everywhere but found no trace.</p>

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>An Old Man Catches Adultery but Ends up a Married Couple: A certain Ma, a resident of Qingpu under a certain town who came from Jiangbei, is now 24 years old. Six years ago, she married Feng Xiaoqing, who was from the same village, through a matchmaker. Three years after the marriage, Xiaoqing died of illness, leaving behind an elderly mother and a son. Xiaoqing had an elder brother named Daqing, who is now working as a coolie in a certain rice mill. His income is very meager, so it is difficult for him to take care of the elderly mother and the widowed sister-in-law. Ma had no means of making a living, so she became acquainted with a clerk named Kuang in a certain store. All daily expenses were provided by Kuang. The day before yesterday, Daqing asked Kuang for some money for his elderly mother's old age expenses, but Kuang refused. Daqing then discovered the night before last that Kuang was spending the night at his sister-in-law's place, so he gathered a group of people and went to catch them in adultery, capturing the adulterous couple. Later, after mediation by Daqing's mother and Kuang's relatives and friends, Kuang paid one hundred yuan to subsidize the elderly mother for the rest of her life. Ma formally married Kuang, and the three-year-old child was raised by Daqing. The matter ended there.</p>
<p>A Wife Deceives Her Husband and Runs Away with Belongings to Her Parents' Home: Xu Mengsheng, a villager from Xucun Township in Qingpu, is 28 years old. He married Ma Xiulai's daughter through a matchmaker two years ago. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was not bad. However, since the autumn of last year, his wife often liked to go out. Xu, being weak by nature, did not stop her. On December 22nd last year, his wife suddenly told her husband that she needed to spend the Lunar New Year with her mother's family and would return after the Lantern Festival in the first month. Xu believed it to be true and let her go to her parents' home. The day before yesterday, the husband went to his parents-in-law's house to inquire, but Xiulai said that she had not returned to their home. Xu then returned home to check his trunks, only to find that all his clothes and ornaments were gone. Xu suddenly realized that his wife had run away with his belongings. He is now searching everywhere.</p>
<p>County Government Ordered to Prepare for the Establishment of a Granary: The granary established in this county has been virtually eliminated since the founding of the Republic of China.

Yesterday, they sent personnel to estimate the price, budgeting the cost at four thousand yuan. It is said that work can begin as soon as the Construction Department approves it. However, according to Director Wang, this telephone line focuses on connecting to Shanghai, and the Ministry of Communications has strict restrictions, so it may not be easy to get it done in a short time.</p>

<h3>Heavy Fog Disrupts Shipping</h3>
<p>▲Imported Vessels All Halted: On the 21st night of this city, a heavy fog suddenly descended. The waterways outside the Wusong port were even more shrouded in mist, making it impossible to discern the routes. Shanghai-bound outgoing vessels were all anchored within Sanxia Water to avoid danger. As for the north-south liners expected to arrive in Shanghai, such as Tianjin Maru, Tongzhou, Lushan Maru, and Sichuan No. 4, a total of six ships were anchored en route, daring not to proceed. Even Yangtze River steamers like Daji Maru, Wusong, and Ruihe dared not sail. Numerous foreign vessels also preemptively anchored to take refuge. Therefore, only the Ningbo-bound Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing vessels entered the port yesterday. Last night, the fog became even denser. After 6:30 PM, the Huangpu River resembled a sea of mist, making it difficult to distinguish anything just inches away. Although the Shanghai-Ningbo vessels that departed from Shanghai that day had already set sail, they mostly anchored at the Wusong port to the sea, continuously sounding their horns throughout the night. It is feared that all the merchant vessels previously blocked will have difficulty entering the port today, and transportation on the rivers and seas will be disrupted.</p>
<p>▲Accident of Japanese Fishing Boats: Recently, Japanese fishing boats have frequently crossed the border to fish in our waters, which not only hinders our fishing industry but also infringes upon our maritime rights. On the 25th of last month, two more Japanese fishing boats, one called Baoyang Maru and the other called Fengpu Maru, each with a carrying capacity of 19 tons, departed from Shimonoseki and went directly to Wusongkou, China, to fish. However, on the 26th, they encountered a strong wind and fog. In the area of Jeju Island, the two ships were separated by the waves. Baoyang Maru sent a wireless message to Shimonoseki, inquiring about the whereabouts of Fengpu Maru. Starting from the 27th, the wind became even stronger and the fog denser.</p>
<p>Baoyang Maru was battered by wind and waves to a point 70 miles away from Huabiao Island. The crew's calls for help went unanswered. The hull was damaged, and the rudder was broken. All food could not be cooked. The crew members drifted on the ship for four days and nights. Finally, on the 7th of this month, they were spotted by a Chinese cargo ship, which rescued the Japanese captain Yu Cun Bing Shi and crew members Shi Jin, Shan Gang, and Zhai Teng, providing them with food and clothing. They have now been brought to Shanghai. According to the ship owner Yu Cun, there were five Japanese crew members on board the Fengpu Maru, and they are likely to have perished. Furthermore, the hull of Baoyang Maru has also broken and sunk into the sea.</p>
<p>▲Situation at Wusong Port: Yesterday morning, at dawn, a heavy fog suddenly arose at Wusong Port, filling the sky. The sea lanes at Sanxia Water were indistinguishable. Merchant ships sailing from Shanghai could not proceed after reaching Song. For a time, the sounds of horns and bells were incessant. The ships had to anchor temporarily. The nautical lighthouse at Baotai Mountain temporarily shone its light to prevent accidents for incoming ships. Due to the east-west and south stone reefs that cross the Huangpu River in Songkou, navigation is even more dangerous. At around 12:00 noon, a sailboat also encountered fog, lost its way, and accidentally struck a stone reef, causing it to capsize. Fortunately, all the crew members were able to climb ashore. In the afternoon, the fog became even denser, so incoming merchant ships could not enter Songkou and had to berth at Sanxia Water. As dusk fell, the fog was still all over the sky. According to shipping experts, such heavy fog is unprecedented in recent times.</p>
<h3>Reiteration of Nighttime Curfew Order</h3>
<p>Due to the unrest in the city last winter, the military and police authorities announced a temporary curfew, cutting off traffic after 12:00 midnight every night. Later, due to the end of the lunar year and the frequent travels of business collectors, the restriction on traffic was implicitly relaxed to show consideration.</p>
<p>Counting the days, it has been more than two weeks since then, and the city has been as peaceful as usual. Now, because Taiyuan's Yan (Xishan) has issued a telegram, rumors are rife. The military and police authorities must strive to maintain local security. Starting from the day before yesterday, double posts have been added to all roads in the Chinese areas every night after 6:00 PM. Armed police officers are stationed in rotation at the borders between the Chinese and concession areas, with three to five officers at each location. Detectives and female inspectors are also cooperating to inspect pedestrians and vehicles at key points to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Every night at 12:00, traffic is cut off according to the curfew law. No one is allowed to pass without a password or symbol.</p>

<h3>Party Department Opposes Jin-Yan</h3>
<p>▲Declaration of the First District Party Department: The Executive Committee of the First District Party Department of this city yesterday declared its opposition to Yan Xishan's absurd remarks, saying, "Mr. Yan Baichuan's advocacy of 'courtesy and concession as the way to govern the country' is a fundamental betrayal of the Party and the principles. There is absolutely no room for courtesy and concession from a revolutionary standpoint. Revolution is our duty and our obligation. What courtesy and concession is there to talk about? As for enjoying rights, that can indeed be done with courtesy and concession. It seems that Mr. Yan himself is specializing in enjoying rights without fulfilling obligations in North China. Mr. Yan Baichuan's advocacy that national affairs should be resolved by the people of the country and party affairs should be resolved by the people of the party is a fundamental destruction of the Party's proposition of building the country with the Party and governing the country with the Party. It seems that he wants to eliminate the Party and bring out the Senate to replay the farce of separatism and strife of the past seventeen years, unconditionally offering the entire Chinese territory and people to the hands of imperialism. Mr. Yan Baichuan's proposal to jointly resolve national affairs by uniting the first, second, and third Executive and Supervisory Committees is a fundamental violation of the constitution and is extremely absurd. In short, Mr. Yan Baichuan, holding an important position, does not strive to work on the great path of revolutionary construction and the aspects of protecting the country and securing the people, but instead is wholeheartedly using speculative means to undermine peaceful unification, endanger the Party and the country, and is willing to be a traitor to the principles and a public enemy of the people, taking his own destruction and following in the footsteps of Tang Shengzhi and Feng Yuxiang. All comrades in this district, for the sake of removing revolutionary obstacles, will engage in hand-to-hand combat with the counter-revolutionary feudal forces, and will never give up until the goal of thoroughly eliminating the feudal forces is achieved. This is hereby declared." ▲Telegram from the Eighth Branch of the Sixth District: Briefly states, "Knowing that comrades will use the relics of the 18th century, the hypocritical fallacy of 'courtesy and concession as the way to govern the country,' to invite Chairman Chiang to step down together, and mistakenly quote the saying 'it is better to stop the chaos than to quell the chaos,' if the comrades are not willingly abandoning themselves to the Party, there would be no such absurdity. Because Chairman Chiang is entrusted by the people of the whole country and bears the heavy responsibility of the Party and the country, he has no freedom and the right to leave or stay. It is in the hands of our compatriots across the country. Who are the comrades? Just a public official of the same country. How can one use one's own intentions to violate the public opinion of the people across the country and invite Chairman Chiang to step down together? This is the first absurdity. Is there anyone more foolish than the comrades? Moreover, today, when traitors are lurking and thinking about delaying, the government's only major responsibility is to quell the chaos. Otherwise, the rebellion of Feng Tang, Zhang Li, and other rebels can never overthrow the Party and the country and do whatever they want, plunging us into deep waters. Taking a step back, if it is as the comrades say, 'it is better to stop the chaos than to quell the chaos,' then the comrades should ask themselves whether they have this courage. This error in thinking, is there anything more than the comrades? Comrades, adhering to the spirit of leniency advocated by the late Premier, especially telegraphed exhortations, hoping to realize and wake up, correct the past and start anew, work hard for the Party, and serve the country.

<h3>Municipal Government to Build Low-Cost Housing in the North and South Districts</h3>
<p>The municipal government has built one hundred low-cost houses near Quan Jia An Road in Zhabei, and the operation is considered relatively complete. However, the number is limited and unable to accommodate as many residents as possible. It is necessary to add more. However, there is no low-cost housing in the Nanshi area, and the construction cannot be delayed. The municipal government recently received a request from the Low-Cost Housing Construction Committee, considering the city's financial situation, and will build one hundred houses in the North and South districts to meet current needs.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau</h3>
<p>Punishes Overloaded Cargo Trucks: The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that overloading trucks not only damages roads but also easily causes danger. It has issued announcements prohibiting overloading and has strictly stipulated clauses in the regulations for punishing vehicles. Violators will be punished according to the regulations without any leniency. The bureau's vehicle inspectors recently discovered two cargo trucks overloading in Nanshi, one belonging to Zhang Yunjia and the other belonging to the Aiwen Automobile Company. The former was loaded with forty pigs and thirty workers, exceeding the specified weight limit by approximately 650 kilograms, and should be fined 32 yuan according to regulations. The latter was loaded with sixty-four pigs and thirty-four workers, exceeding the specified weight limit by approximately 1,600 kilograms, and should be fined 86 yuan according to regulations. Later, the vehicle owners requested leniency in the punishment, but the bureau stated that the regulations were announced and implemented by the municipal government and could not be changed. They were rejected and required to pay the fines within three days.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Issues Electrical Equipment Inspection Certificates for Public Places</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau inspects the electrical equipment of public places in the city as soon as new installations are reported, and the existing ones are inspected in districts in sequence. The work is nearing completion. However, after the electrical equipment of these users has passed the inspection, it is difficult to identify it without a proper mark. The bureau has specially produced a "Electrical Equipment Inspection Qualification Certificate for Public Places" and has stipulated seven measures, which have been announced and implemented.</p>
<h3>Migration Requires Submission of Rent Book for Verification</h3>
<p>▲New Plan to Promote Rent Books: The Shanghai Special Finance Bureau issued a "Rent Book" last year, which was purchased by landlords in the city. Each book is priced at ten cents.</p>
<p>Landlords use it to collect rent from tenants. The bureau also sent a letter to the court stating that in the future, in cases of rent disputes between landlords and tenants, the rent book must be submitted for verification, otherwise the case will not be accepted. Later, the bureau found that the number of rent books sold since the issuance last year has been unsatisfactory. According to statistics, less than a quarter of the households in the city have purchased them. It is clear that landlords are waiting to see what happens. If strict measures are not taken, it will greatly hinder the city's revenue. It has now been decided that in the future, when residents in each district report migration or immigration, they should be required to submit the rent book for verification, otherwise registration will not be allowed. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to order the heads and police of household registration in each district to follow the procedures.</p>
<h3>Port Authority Rejects</h3>
<p>Dada's Request to Maintain Coastline Contract: Dada Steamship Company recently submitted a presentation to the Municipal Port Authority, requesting to maintain the original contract because the company's lease contract for the coastline was announced by the Municipal Port Authority. According to the information, the Port Authority, in accordance with the notice issued by the Municipal Government in November of the 16th year of the Republic of China that all contracts signed between municipal agencies and merchants should be submitted to the government for review. The Contract Review Committee decided that all contracts should be revised and were approved by the Municipal Government, directing the company to comply with the order to submit the original lease contract for the coastline to the government for revision. Since the establishment of the Port Authority, the company has delayed the matter for more than two years, citing various excuses. The company is both violating the order and abandoning its rights. The municipal government should adhere to the principle of developing the social economy when promoting local undertakings. The company's pursuit of profit and monopoly has caused suffering to ship merchants, hindering the progress of shipping. To declare the company's original coastline contract invalid and to take back the wharf built by the city is a proper administrative action. However, in order to show consideration for the merchants' difficulties, the committee was established to evaluate the price of the wharf and other buildings, and pay for the recovery, which is in the development of the social economy, while maintaining the interests of merchants. The Port Authority has rejected the request.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</h3>
<p>Restricts Short-Term Employment Contracts: The Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory of Weicheng Company recently leased its factory cheaply due to its inability to maintain operations, and signed employment contracts with workers for only three months. The Bureau of Social Affairs' Investigation Office learned of this and immediately ordered a correction and informed the trade union. It also instructed the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Industry Association to prohibit similar situations. The instructions stated: "For compliance matters, the 50th Bureau Affairs Meeting of this Bureau decided that the minimum term of employment contracts should be one year. Now, according to the investigation report, the Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory of Weicheng Company rented out the entire factory due to its inability to maintain operations and signed employment contracts with workers for only three months, etc. Therefore, in addition to ordering corrections, we urge you to inform the industry to comply."</p>
<h3>Electricity</h3>
<p>Instructions Regarding the Revision of Wage Standards for the Silk Weaving Industry ▲ Must Comply with and Implement Labor Agreement Conditions ▲ The Shanghai Electrical Silk Weaving Trade Association, citing the increasing number of independent weaving machines in the city—investigations reveal over 4,000, more than double the number in the association's factories—reported that the wages of these independent machines are unrestricted and that there is no set method for their sale.  The majority are sold wholesale by shops or door-to-door.  Due to lower costs, they are easily marketed. At a time when sales are sluggish and business is plummeting, this formidable competition makes it difficult to cope without reducing wages to compete.  Therefore, they have repeatedly petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for permission to revise wages as a remedy.  An investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau found that the wage provisions in the labor-management agreement for the industry were quite appropriate. The current situation is entirely due to factories in the industry freely increasing production during good business times, leading to unlimited growth. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately issued an order to the association, instructing them to inform their members to comply with and implement the conditions uniformly.  The original text of the instructions is recorded below. Both submissions have been noted.  Upon review of the wage standards for various goods, Article 3 of the labor-management agreed treatment conditions for the industry already provides specific regulations. It is hereby ordered that the association notify its members to comply with and implement them uniformly. This concludes the instructions.</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of the接管接管接管接管Merchant Steam Navigation Bureau</h3>

<h3>The Reality of Silver Transport Bidding</h3>
<p>The transportation of silver dollars in Shanghai has traditionally been undertaken by the Datong Xinji Transportation Company of Ningbo Road Tonghe Lane. Later, due to the Ministry of Railways increasing freight rates and the discount given to the company being reduced from 28% to 15%, and since the burning of the Nanjing Mint resulted in no large amounts of silver coins to transport, and the Central Bank needed to transport silver for free, business declined sharply, making it impossible to maintain operations. At the end of last year according to the lunar calendar, the company sent a letter to the Silver Trade Association and the Money Trade Association stating that it would cease transportation services starting in January of this year. Since the company stopped operating, whenever silver dollars needed to be transported in or out, personnel had to be sent to liaise with the station in person and to escort the shipment, which was not only costly and cumbersome but also raised concerns about accidents. It was hoped that the Ministry of Railways would invite bids for a contractor. The bidding was originally scheduled to take place on the 14th of this month, so that someone would be responsible for the transportation from then on. However, all transportation companies believed that even with 28%, they would still lose money, so there was no way to reduce the discount. As a result, no one dared to bid, and no one is responsible for transportation to this day. The Silver Trade Association believes that this is a major issue, and the spring silkworm season is approaching, creating a need for silver transport.</p>
<p>Continuing this delay is highly inappropriate. It is now planned to detail the difficult situation to the Ministry of Railways and request assistance.</p>
<h3>American Officials and Civilians Celebrate Washington's Birthday</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Citizen Training Committee Forbids Staff from Receiving Entertainment</h3>
<p>▲Strict Penalties Established in Three Articles ▲ To Prevent Solicitation from Both Labor and Management ▲ The Municipal Party Committee's Mass Training Committee recently noted that when disputes occasionally arise between labor and management in the city, banquets are often hosted to entertain the committee's staff in the hope of gaining influence. The committee deemed this inappropriate and, after a resolution at the tenth standing committee meeting, has banned staff members from accepting entertainment when disputes arise between labor and management, and has instructed the district mass training directors to report to the executive committee for record. The order to the district mass training directors is recorded below: Regarding the matter of the notification, it has been noted that when disputes occur between labor and management in the city, staff members of this committee are invited to banquets to explain the case or even to solicit favors in order to obtain convenience. Such a situation easily creates a pretext for criticism. After deliberation at the tenth meeting of this committee, it has been decided that if any staff member of the committee is found to have engaged in the above-mentioned conduct, they will be penalized as follows: the first offense will result in a fine of half a month's salary, the second offense will result in suspension of duties for one month, and the third offense will result in dismissal from employment. This matter concerns the rectification of internal staff and has been reported to the Municipal Executive Committee for review and record. You are hereby ordered to notify your staff accordingly. This order.</p>
<h3>Preparing Silk Exhibits for Exhibition in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Capital National Products Exhibition Hall is scheduled to hold an exhibition of domestic silk products in March and April of this year.

<h3>Shanghai-Minhang Buses Increase Fares</h3>
<p>▲Full Fare Six Jiao ▲ The Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe long-distance bus service operating between Shanghai and Minhang was taken over by the Communications Company last year. The original full fare was eight jiao. During the trial lease period, a temporary discount of 30% was applied, resulting in a fare of seven jiao. Recently, due to the continued increase in the cost of gasoline and other materials, it has become difficult to maintain the concession, so the fares have been slightly changed to 1.5 jiao from the Shanghai station to Tushan Bay, with an additional five fen added for each subsequent station. The full fare from the Shanghai station to Minhang is six jiao. This has been submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval. The bureau considered that the route is 31 kilometers long and the current full fare of six jiao is less than two fen per kilometer. Moreover, considering the original fare of eight jiao, which is already low, and that the increase from the 30% discount fare of 5.8 jiao is minimal, they reported the matter to the municipal government. The government has approved the plan.</p>

The key resolutions were: (1) to petition the superior party organization to request the National Government to order all ordnance factories in the country to uniformly adopt the plant's steel materials; (2) to question the Shanghai Ordnance Factory for refusing to use the steel plant's steel materials and to send representatives to petition the superior party organization for relief within the next few days.</p>

<h3>The "Daredevil" Movie Starring Rock</h3>
<p>Contains Insults to Chinese People ▲ The Audience at the Grand Theater is Very Dissatisfied ▲ Hong Shen Speaks Out Against the Absurdity of the Film ▲ The Crowd Immediately Leaves and Demands Refunds ▲ The Film Censorship Committee Works to Ban the Film ▲ The "Daredevil" sound film starring Rock, produced by Paramount Pictures, which recently began showing at the Grand Theater on Jing'an Temple Road, has been doing well at the box office. However, the film contains backgrounds such as Cantonese people and Chinatown, and the subject matter is absurd, which is very offensive to Chinese people. During the 5:30 PM showing yesterday, the audience was very dissatisfied because it considered the film to be extremely insulting to Chinese people. At that time, Hong Shen, a drama professor at Fudan University, spoke out against the absurdity of the film, and the crowd joined in, leaving and demanding refunds of more than 300 tickets. During the chaos, the audience questioned the Western manager, causing some disorder. After receiving the news, the New Zha Police Department immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to suppress the situation, which was quickly calmed down. Hong Shen also went to the police station to explain everything and left.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Special City Film Censorship Committee believes that the "Daredevil" film starring Rock, which is being shown at the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater, completely insults Chinese people. The committee believes that the two theaters are showing this type of film despite public anger, which is outrageous. The ad hoc committee resolved the following: (1) to warn the two theaters; (2) to submit a request to the municipal government to negotiate seriously with the American Consul; (3) to publish advertisements warning Chinese people not to watch the film again; (4) to order all theaters not to show the film again.</p>
<h3>Gunfight on Xinjiang Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Bandits Resist Arrest and Open Fire ▲ Stray Bullet Kills One and Wounds One ▲ It is Unknown Whether the Deceased Was a Bandit ▲ Around 7:30 PM last night, bandits resisted arrest and opened fire at the intersection of Xinjiang Road and Wuzhen Road in Zhabei, killing one person and wounding one rickshaw puller. One principal offender and three suspects were apprehended on the spot by Zhabei detectives from the Public Security Bureau. The details are as follows: ▲Informant's Report ▲ Qiao Songsheng, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently ordered all detectives to step up precautions due to the unrest in the area. Yesterday evening, Wang Shifu, the leader of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau's detective team, received a report from an informant that five or six bandits were gathering in a small teahouse west of the fire station on Xinmin Road, carrying guns and weapons. Leader Wang immediately led detectives Su Sheng, Dou Yulin, Lu Xingchun, Hua Yingzhou, Wang Zijun, and others, fully armed, to Xinmin Road to investigate and apprehend them. ▲Bandits Resist Arrest ▲ The detectives rushed to the small teahouse on Xinmin Road, but the bandits had already fled after hearing the news. They were then led by the informant to Xinjiang Road, near Wuzhen Road, where they found the bandits coming from the east. They immediately ordered them to stop and submit to a search. The bandits, seeing that the situation was unfavorable, immediately drew their guns and opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives returned fire, and the two sides exchanged fire for at least seven or eight shots. The bandits, numbering about five or six, seeing that they were outnumbered, fled in different directions. One bandit was apprehended on the spot by the detectives, along with a gun and three bullets, and taken to the police station. In addition, three suspects were also apprehended. ▲One Killed and One Wounded ▲ After the gunfire stopped, one person was found lying motionless on the street, wearing a blue cloth robe and a melon-skin cap. The person had been shot twice, both times in vital areas. However, it is still unclear whether the deceased was a bandit or a passerby. At the time of the shooting, a rickshaw puller named Qian Wancheng was passing through the area and was struck in the abdomen by a stray bullet, sustaining serious injuries. He was taken by police car to the district office and then transferred to Baolong Hospital for treatment. His rickshaw number was 2285. ▲Four Apprehended ▲ A total of four people were apprehended by the detectives. One of them was the principal offender named Zhang Bin (also known as Xu Jianwu), 29 years old, from Anhui, living in the Huafeng Workshop in Wusong, working in a sugar factory. The three suspects were Zhu Jun, 26 years old, from Yancheng, living in a bungalow in Zhabei, Pubei, selling fruit; Zhou Yuetao, 31 years old, from Yancheng, living at No. 22 Yongxing Lane, Nanmatou, working as a rickshaw puller; and Zhang Yuetong, 33 years old, from Funing, living in the Xu Family Residence on Qiujiang Road, the owner of the Longxing Tea Garden.</p>

<h3>Public Concession</h3>
<p>Foreign Candidate Directors ▲ The Pioneering Initiative of a Beautiful Candidate, as reported by the Great Evening News, today, Shanghai women's groups have set a precedent in the political history of the Public Concession by nominating Miss Smith, a beauty, as a candidate for the Municipal Council. Miss Smith currently serves as the Deputy Commissioner of the U.S. Department of Commerce and is considered a leader among professional women. This morning, she was nominated by Miss Virginia of Caldbeck, Macgregor &amp; Co. on Nanjing Road, and seconded by Mrs. Whitehouse. According to the Municipal Council election regulations, a woman candidate is unprecedented in this city.

<h3>Steamed Bone Examination Case</h3>
<p>There is Talk of Another Appeal ▲ Yesterday's Trial at the District Court ▲ No Plaintiff Appeared ▲ The Deceased Suffered Greatly Before Death ▲ Its Root Cause Was Superstition The remains of Chen Xun (née Sun Genbao), daughter-in-law of the late Chen Shuangxi, a wealthy man from Jiangbei outside Suzhou's Changmen, have been confirmed by the Shanghai District Court's steamed bone examination to be a case of hanging suicide. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After the examination, Prosecutor Yang instructed both parties to appear at the court at 2 PM the next day (yesterday) for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, the defendants all complied and reported as instructed, while no one from the plaintiff's side appeared. Subsequently, Prosecutor Yang briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to leave, pending further review by higher authorities. However, it is heard that the plaintiff's side is preparing to appeal again. It is said that the deceased suffered abuse before her death. The origin of the abuse was that shortly after the deceased married into the family, two of her nephews died young. The Chen family was deeply superstitious and believed that the deceased's birth year and date contained great misfortune, which was detrimental to the Chen family. They also suspected that the woman's family coveted the Chen family's wealth, so they changed the deceased's birth year and date during the marriage arrangements. The Chen family did not notice and rashly arranged the marriage. After the death of the two children, the Chen family hated the deceased as an ominous object and abuse began. On the afternoon of the seventeenth day of the third month of the lunar calendar last year, at about 4 PM, the deceased died. During the initial examination by the Wu County Court the next day, the deceased had injuries all over her body, which was also a result of the poison of superstition.</p>
<h3>Yi County Youths in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Involved in Lawsuit Due to Literary Dispute ▲ Yi Society and Inspirational Society Incompatible ▲ Wang Liwu Files Criminal Charges ▲ Yu, Hu, and Chen Also File Counter-Suit ▲ Both Parties Found Not Guilty Yu Jie'an, Hu Xiehou, Chen Moruo, and others, natives of Yi County, Anhui Province, living in Shanghai, formed the Yi Society and published a journal called "Yi Sound Report," edited by Chen, with Yu serving as the Director of the General Affairs Department and Hu as the Director of the Accounting Department. Wang Liwu, also from Yi County, held an important position in the Yi Mountain Youth Inspirational Society in Shanghai, which also published a journal called "Yi Mountain Youth Monthly," edited by Wang. Although these two groups shared the same hometown name, they were like Qin and Yue, constantly attacking each other in newspapers, leading to a heated literary war. Recently, they became involved in a lawsuit. Wang first filed criminal charges against Yu, Hu, and Chen in the Provisional Court for defamation, claiming that the defendants published false facts and defamatory language in the first, second, third, and fourth issues of the "Yi Sound Report," accusing the plaintiff of "swindling and exploiting for personal gain," and stating that the plaintiff "uses this group as a tool for his speculative profit-making," etc., deliberately insulting him. The plaintiff works in the press and has authored many books and newspapers, and plans to establish a printing house. The defendants' false accusations damage his reputation, infringing on the plaintiff's legal rights. Therefore, he requests the court to summon the defendants to the court and punish them according to Article 325, paragraph 2, or Article 330 of the criminal law, and also requests incidental private prosecution to compensate for all losses. The defendants jointly retained lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a defense. The main points of their defense are divided into two parts: (1) Yu Jie'an and Hu Xiehou are not editors of the "Yi Sound Report." Even if the report does contain damage to reputation or public insults, Yu and Hu are not responsible in any way. (2) Although Chen Moruo is the editor of the "Yi Sound Report," the author is responsible for the words that the plaintiff claims to be damaging to reputation and publicly insulting. Even if Chen is responsible for the articles published in "Yi Sound Report," whether or not he bears criminal responsibility depends on whether the words published in "Yi Sound Report" violate Article 325, paragraph 2, and Article 330 of the criminal law. Whether or not those articles violate each of those criminal articles depends on three points for research: (A) The "Yi Sound Report" said that the plaintiff "swindles and exploits for personal gain" and "uses this group as a tool for his speculative profit-making," etc. These words are based on the request of Pan Dingyuan et al. at the 32nd regular meeting of the Shanghai Guidance Committee published in the Shanghai Central Daily on August 19, 1928, and the request of Zhang Chaoren et al. On August 6, 1928, the Times published news about the disciplinary action against Wang Liwu by the Party Training students. On December 3, 1929, the News published Announcement No. 62 of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and the Shanghai Special City Party Affairs Guidance Committee pointed to Announcement No. 15, as well as Wang Liwu's business cards and letters from comrades in various places, which are sufficient to prove the plaintiff's "swindling and exploiting for personal gain" and "using the group as a tool for speculative profit-making" are true. These facts are related to the public interest, so according to Article 326 of the Criminal Law, even if defamation is involved, there is no penalty. (B) The resolution of the 49th regular meeting of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party stated that party members who have been expelled from the party should not be elected as officials of various people's organizations. Announcement No. 62 also stated that this was to prevent problems from the start. However, the plaintiff, by exploiting connections, became an important official of the Yi Mountain Youth Inspirational Society and published the "Yi Mountain Youth Monthly," wantonly attacking the party, government, and all sectors of Yi County. His violation of the Kuomintang resolution to engage in speculative profit-making is very obvious. The "Yi Sound Report" is responsible for guiding the people of Yi County and fully exposing this darkness to prevent the people from being deceived, which is in line with Article 327, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Law. In the "Answering Questions from Guests for Yi Society" published in the "Yi Mountain Youth Monthly" on November 8, 1929, the plaintiff stated that "the spirit of Yi Sound is not pure," and also stated that "within the Yi Society, there are not a few local tyrants, evil gentry, corrupt officials, academic scoundrels, and degenerate youths mixed in," and also stated that the people of Yi Society are "despicable and lowly." Therefore, Hu Lichuan's article "Wang Liwu of Thousand Changes" in the "Yi Sound" is purely for self-defense, which is in line with Article 327, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. (C) The statements of the "Yi Sound Report" are, as described in item A, completely true facts, and it is known that they are not rumors. Also, as described in item B, the "Yi Sound Report" makes appropriate comments on matters that are subject to public criticism, or acts out of self-defense, and it can be known that it does not damage the plaintiff through fraud. After the defense statement, a counterclaim was also attached, with words the same as described in item B, also requesting that Wang Liwu be punished with Article 300 and Article 330 of the criminal law, and finally requesting permission to reserve the incidental private prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Jianzu held a hearing to collect information. Lawyers for both sides presented evidence (newspapers). Then Wang Liwu made a statement, vehemently refuting the defendants' accusation that he had been expelled from the party, saying that he was not expelled from the party, but was not allowed to register, and that he had appealed to the higher party headquarters against the municipal party headquarters' disposition, and also said that the municipal party headquarters' announcement referred to his activities outside, and there were no words about swindling, etc. After successive arguments by the lawyers on both sides, Judge Wang immediately announced the verdict: Yu Jie'an and Hu Xiehou have nothing to do with the "Yi Sound Report," and are declared not guilty. Although Chen Moruo is the editor of "Yi Sound," the news published was transcribed from the Central Daily, so he is not responsible, and is declared not guilty. The counterclaim portion was dismissed for lack of evidence, and Wang Liwu was released without charge. After the verdict, Wang was still not convinced and shouted "appeal, appeal" incessantly.</p>
<h3>Cigar Holder</h3>
<p>Disguised as a Pistol ▲ Could Not Escape the Detective's Eye ▲ Real Pistol Frightened Off Bandits ▲ One Person Was Captured at the Time ▲ Sentenced to Five Years in Western Prison A probationary detective from the French Concession Police Station No. 125 was returning to his residence the night before last when, while passing near Route Pére Robert in the French Concession, three bandits, including Lu Xiudao, suddenly approached and blocked the detective's path, implementing their "slaughter the pig" principle, using a cigar holder as a pistol to prevent him from making any noise. The detective, seeing this situation, pretended to reach for his wallet and silver dollars, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a real pistol. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the bandits turned and fled. The detective bravely stepped forward, captured one of the robbers, Lu, and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the French court for investigation. First, the detective took the stand and explained the situation and presented the defendant's fake pistol as evidence. When Lu Xiudao was questioned, he confessed to conspiring with the gang to rob, and stated that he had indeed committed a robbery with Zhang Heshang, who is still at large, on Route de Villermont last month. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Lu Xiudao to five years in Western Prison for violating Article 370 of the criminal law, and to be permanently expelled from the Concession upon completion of his term.</p>
<h3>Encounter with a Ghost at Night?</h3>
<p>▲ The Accounts of the Two People Coincide ▲ There May Be Other Circumstances Involved Yin Linsheng, 24 years old, residing in Zhanghua Port Zhangzhuzhai, has been working as a mechanic at the Huangpu Engineering Department (i.e., the Dredging Bureau). At around 9 PM the night before last (the 21st), Yin was returning to Zhangzhuzhai from working the night shift at the bureau when, near the Zhanghua Port train station, he suddenly saw a person about five feet tall with very long hair, disheveled and draped over their shoulders, with a hideous face, jumping out of the darkness and rushing towards Yin. Yin, seeing this, suspected it was a bandit, was greatly alarmed, and immediately turned and fled, shouting for help. The Yin Xing Security Corps detachment stationed near the station heard the shout and immediately sent a team to rescue him. Seeing Yin running, they suspected he was a robber and immediately fired a warning shot into the sky. Yin, seeing a large team of Security Corps members arriving, became emboldened, immediately stopped, and explained the reason for his cry for help to the corps members. The corps members searched the surrounding area in all directions, but found no trace. However, they saw a man surnamed Zhang on the north side of the railway, burning paper money in front of his house. The corps members went forward to ask if he had seen anyone matching the above description passing by. According to Zhang, he was burning paper money to send away ghosts because a member of his family was seriously ill, and he had inadvertently seen a cloud of black energy rushing out of his house towards the door, and had seen a person in the shape described above walking in the black energy, and disappearing shortly afterward, presumably the ghost sent away from his house.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The corps members, although Zhang's account matched Yin Linsheng's, found the account very bizarre and difficult to believe, fearing that there might be other hidden circumstances. They immediately escorted Yin to the Zhanghua Port Police Station of the Seventh District, First Branch of the Wusong Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Devout Buddhist Old Woman</h3>
<p>Tragically Killed Under a Car Jiao Dingkai, from Yangzhou, serves in politics and lives at No. 417 Chongqing Road. His mother, Wu, is 76 years old and usually a devout Buddhist, burning incense daily. At 5 PM the day before yesterday, the old woman went to a Buddhist hall to pray. While walking on Route Ménard, several British soldiers driving car No. 5895 drove from Avenue Foch and knocked the old woman down, crushing her vital parts. She was sent to the hospital by a patrol car, but treatment was ineffective and she died from her injuries. The Xinzha Police Station, upon receiving the report, ordered the body to be taken to the coroner's office on Route Pichon. Yesterday morning, Provisional Court Judge Tan arrived at the office to conduct a coroner's inquest, and ascended to the bench to investigate the situation. He then instructed the deceased's son, Jiao Dingkai, to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3>By the Side of Liaoyang Road</h3>
<p>Female Corpse Examined and Found to Be Strangled The body of a young woman was found on the side of Liaoyang Road, Kunming Road, Hongkou, the morning before last. A Westerner passing by saw it and reported it to the Wayside Police Station by telephone. The police sent detectives to take the body to the coroner's office on Route Pichon. Yesterday morning, the Provisional Court was notified, and Judge Tan Xinzhen arrived at the office to conduct a coroner's inquest. He ascended to the bench. First, the Western Deputy Chief of the Wayside Police Station reported the situation. Then, Western Detective Chief Burrington Shap said that after receiving the report, he went to investigate and found the deceased lying on the ground on Liaoyang Road, with her right hand touching her neck, which was surrounded by a hemp rope. He asked a Western doctor to examine her, who said that she had been strangled. The deceased looked like a female worker, about twenty years old, and her family had not yet arrived. Judge Tan, after hearing the report, concluded that the deceased had indeed been strangled to death before her death. Since there were no family members, the corpse was handed over to the Pushan Villa for coffin and burial. He ordered the police to investigate the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Liu Lianghong Case</h3>
<p>Zheng Xinzhang Released for Lack of Connection to Case After the assassination of Liu Lianghong, the "King of Flower Games," and Zheng Meitang last summer, Zheng Xinzhang, Zheng's brother, was arrested at the Chenghuang Temple some days ago in connection with the Liu case. However, Liu was murdered on Yunnan Road in the Public Concession that day, so the police sent detectives to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to bring Zheng Xinzhang back. The investigation has now concluded, and there is no evidence of his involvement in the Liu case. Yesterday morning, Zheng was escorted to the Provisional Court, and the police chief requested to withdraw the charges. Judge Wang granted the request and ordered Zheng Xinzhang to be released.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Con Artists Releasing White Doves</h3>
<p>▲ Li Xiangsheng Borrows Money to Get Married ▲ Losing Both Wife and Money, He is Resentful Li Xiangsheng, 34 years old, from Funing, has been working in the Second Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Camp. Although he is over thirty, he is still single. In December of last year, his acquaintances Chen Fengxiang and Zuo Shihong came and said that there was a widow, Shen Yan, named A Si, 23 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangbei. Her husband died early, her family was poor, and she had no means of support, so she had decided to remarry. Her appearance was very beautiful, but she needed to raise a dowry of 200 yuan to make it happen. Li was moved by the news and readily agreed. He borrowed 100 yuan from relatives and friends, and then set a date to sign a marriage contract in a certain teahouse. At the time, the matchmakers and the woman were all present to sign and affix their fingerprints. Li saw that the woman was indeed beautiful and was very happy. He took out the dowry of 100 yuan, exchanged it for the marriage contract, and took the woman home. He also made her beautiful new clothes and jewelry. Then he held a banquet to entertain guests. But Chen Fengxiang and Shen Yan were actually engaged in a scheme of con artists releasing white doves. Less than a month after the woman married into the family, she changed her mind completely. She knew that Li's monthly income was not very high, and he had no savings and a normal family situation. Since she could not extort much money from him, she decided to leave as soon as possible. On the 2nd of this month, she took advantage of Li's unpreparedness and secretly hid her jewelry and other items in her arms. She then made an excuse to go out to make tea, took a copper teapot, and left, never to return. When Li realized what had happened, he was both heartbroken and regretful. He had been deceived, but there was nothing he could do. He had to ask people to search in all directions. It was not until the day before yesterday that he received a secret tip from a friend that the woman was hiding at the home of Shi Shen, a woman from Taizhou, her little sister, at No. 954 North Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. At about 10 PM that evening, he went and arrested Shen Yan, i.e., A Si, and Shi Shen, and escorted them to the First Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in the South City, requesting a thorough investigation and the recovery of the dowry and jewelry. The police chief conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered them to be detained separately pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Unmarried Woman Becomes Pregnant</h3>
<p>▲ Forced Marriage Ultimately Ineffective ▲ Plans to File a Lawsuit in Court Wang Xiaomei, nicknamed "Long Legs," the daughter of Wang Heshang of Hebei, Hongqiao Town, Shanghai West, is 24 years old and has a good appearance. Since childhood, she had been betrothed to Xianglin, son of the late Shen Er, from Yangquan, Binanzhi, but both parties were over twenty and had not yet married. But Xiaomei was in her prime, a young maiden living at home. Secretly, she had an affair with a Fan from the nearby workshop, and had secretly crossed the Chencang valley more than once. But beautiful days don't last, and good things are often delayed. Recently, she became pregnant, and her belly was getting big. Her fiancé, Shen Xianglin, found out and gathered many people the day before yesterday to forcibly marry her. After arriving at his house, he helped Xiaomei change into palace attire (i.e., the clothes worn by the bride) and respectfully worshiped heaven and earth. At that time, Wang Xiaomei had no way to resist and had to let him do as he pleased. The next day, when she returned home (commonly known as returning to the natal family), Xiaomei took off her palace attire, tore it all up, and denied the illegal marriage, vowing that she would not follow Shen. It is now heard that she is drafting a lawsuit to file a criminal complaint in court.</p>

<h3>Suicide Due to Inability to Pay Rent</h3>
<p>At number 12326 Zhaofeng Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, resided Xu Haiqing from Anhui. Xu was a sub-landlord, involved in disputes with his subtenants. However, Xu himself owed the landlord four months' rent. The landlord repeatedly demanded payment without success and took Xu to the Fourth District Police Station.

His tenant, Jin Xueqing, attempted to rescue him, but it was too late. He reported the incident to the police station. Yesterday, the police ordered Jin Ertu and the local constable, Wang Shaoting, to report the matter to the District Court for verification. Inspector Lei and others arrived at the scene for inspection and confirmed the death as suicide by hanging.

<h3>Fire Report from Lan Ni Du Yesterday Morning</h3>

<p>▲ Suspected Arson for Insurance Claim</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out upstairs at Xin Xie Shun Congee Shop, number 292, Dandanggong Alley, Lan Ni Du Street, Pudong. Thick smoke billowed out, threatening to spread. Fortunately, the Zhong family from Hubei, residing behind the shop, were hosting a wake for a deceased relative and were still awake. They shouted for help to put out the fire. Police officers Lang Shiquan and Shen Guangyun from the Third District Public Security Bureau heard the cries and rushed to the scene, sounding the alarm. Neighbors were awakened from their sleep and assisted in pouring water to extinguish the fire, preventing a major disaster. Police officers then went upstairs for inspection, discovering a basket of partially burned old cotton wadding with the smell of kerosene, as well as a jar containing a mixture of alcohol and kerosene. Upon closer examination, all items were determined to be accelerants. The shop owner was nowhere to be found, with only a shop assistant named Shi Kanglang present. Shi was taken to the district for questioning along with the evidence. Shi claimed to be 47 years old, from Chongming, and had been working at the shop since the first month of the lunar calendar. He did not know the owner's name, the cause of the fire, or the insurance amount. The district chief, upon reviewing the testimony, suspected the shop of arson for insurance fraud and ordered Shi to be detained temporarily. He also dispatched police officers to the Commercial Association to inventory the items in the shop and await summons for the shop owner to come for investigation.</p>

At about 11:00 PM that night, while passing the Panlonggang area of Zhuangjiajing, more than ten armed bandits suddenly appeared, firing a shot to force the driver to stop the boat. They stormed the company boat, threatening passengers and searching them thoroughly. They also approached the ship's purser, threatening him with a gun to force him to hand over money. After about an hour and a half, they fled with their loot, shouting triumphantly. The total loss is estimated to be over a thousand yuan. The ship's purser reported the incident to the local Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation and arrest of the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>French Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Reinstates Dismissed Workers</p>
<p>The French Water and Electricity Company had recently dismissed two workers, Dong Keguang and Zhu Asan, without cause. Subsequently, the Water and Electricity Workers' Union sent representatives Xu A'mei, Xu Mao'mao, Xu Shunsheng, and Zhang A'mao to negotiate with the company's foreman. Yesterday morning, at 6:45 AM, all the workers arrived at the factory, waiting to be allowed to enter and begin work. However, the factory manager, Barre, questioned the union's standing committee member, Xu A'mei, asking if they would be working today (i.e., yesterday). The workers replied that the time had not yet arrived. Manager Barre then went directly into the lathe room and closed the door, leaving the workers with nothing to do.</p>
<p>From 6:30 AM to 5:00 PM, the company intervened to resolve the situation. As a result, they agreed to reinstate Dong Keguang yesterday and Zhu Asan today, bringing the disturbance to an end.</p>
<h3>Zhu Da Steals Pig, Falls into Cesspit</h3>
<p>▲ Soaking Steamed Buns in Alcohol to Intoxicate Pigs</p>
<p>▲ Drowning a Pig Leads to Twenty Yuan Compensation</p>
<p>Ruan Qinxiang, from Jiangbei, who lives in a flat near Gujia Garden in Zhabei, makes a living by raising pigs. He had built a pigsty behind his house. When selling pigs last year, he kept two pigs unsold, to prepare for slaughtering when his second son, Xiaolong, married in March this spring. Unexpectedly, a neighbor named Zhu Da, having lost money gambling during the New Year, decided to steal Ruan’s two fat pigs to recoup his losses. He soaked a steamed bun in liquor, removed it after a while, and went to the pigsty late at night, throwing the liquor-soaked bun to the pigs to eat. Within minutes, the pigs were intoxicated. Zhu opened the pigsty and attempted to steal a pig and flee. However, there was a cesspit in the area, buried deep in the ground. Zhu panicked and fell into the pit, along with the pig. Fortunately, there was not much excrement, and he was not submerged. Unable to climb out of the pit, Zhu called for help. Ruan heard the cries and shone a light, recognizing his neighbor Zhu Da. He managed to help Zhu out of the pit, but Zhu was covered in excrement and smelled terrible. Ruan then discovered that one of his pigs had drowned in the pit. It was clear that Zhu had fallen into the pit while trying to steal the pig. Ruan negotiated with Zhu, threatening to take him to the police station. However, neighbors intervened and mediated, resulting in Zhu paying twenty yuan to compensate for the pig, settling the matter.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Smuggle Opium Discovered</h3>
<p>At the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, at around 5:00 PM yesterday, a night passenger train No. 10 preparing to depart for Hangzhou was boarded by a person resembling a tea attendant, about twenty years old, carrying two large paper packages. He crossed the tracks from the back door of the station to the rear platform to board the train. The railway police at the station, noticing his panicked demeanor, approached him for inspection. The paper packages contained four pieces of opium, weighing 112 taels in total. The person and the opium were immediately detained and taken to the police station. The stationmaster was present, and the case was sealed with the station's stamp, before being sent to the District Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>106 sets of bones were collected, and 10,643 large and small coffins were provided free of charge. The hospital had provided medical treatment and medicine a total of 41,758 times. He also proposed that the existing resting place was insufficient and that five more rooms should be built for storage. However, there was a lack of funding, and a solution needed to be found to remedy this. Mr. Chen Liangyu spoke, stating that Mr. Wang Junsheng had fulfilled his duties and shown great enthusiasm in handling burial affairs over the years, neglecting no effort.

<h3>Ministry of Education Letter of Appointment</h3>
<p>Experts for the National Education Conference The Ministry of Education has selected twenty-four experts for the National Education Conference, and appointment letters will be issued on the 22nd. Among them are Chen Heqin, an expert in early childhood education, Liu Enzhan, an expert in vocational education, Zhang Boling, a representative of private universities, Tao Zhixing and Tao Xuan, rural normal school teachers, Liao Maoru, a secondary education expert, Yu Ziyi, an elementary school expert, and Shi Weihuan, a Party Ideology Education expert.</p>
<p>A detailed list will be provided later.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Recommendation</h3>
<p>Wang Keren Appointed Supervisor of Students Studying in Japan Jiang Qi, the supervisor of students studying in Japan, previously had problems with the Party headquarters and requested to resign. The Ministry of Education dispatched Luo Qun, the manager of Guangdong students studying in Japan, to temporarily act as supervisor and appointed Zhu Baoqin, a counselor of the Ministry, to investigate in Japan. Now, according to Jiang Qi's written request to the Ministry, he sincerely requests to resign, and Luo Yiqun, due to poor health, is unable to take on the task and requests to be replaced by a formal supervisor. The Ministry of Education has appointed Wang Keren (a Guizhou native who graduated from the United States), the former principal of Wuxi Middle School and the current director of the Party Ideology Education Department of the Central Training Department, as the supervisor of students studying in Japan, and has reported to the Executive Yuan for approval and record.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the affairs of the Supervisor's Office are becoming increasingly busy. The original organizational outline of the Supervisor's Office for Students Studying in Japan needs to be revised. Therefore, on the 15th, a request was submitted to the Executive Yuan to revise the organizational outline. The supervisor's position was originally a recommended appointment, but it is now changed to a simplified appointment. Under the supervisor, there were originally two section chiefs for academic affairs and general affairs, but now each section is changed to have one director and two staff members. It is heard that the expenses of the Supervisor's Office were previously 1,400 yuan per month, and the budget for the 18th year has been increased to over 2,000 yuan per month. However, this budget has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan. As for the position of supervisor of students studying in Japan, the Ministry of Education has obtained Wang Keren's consent. Yesterday (the 21st), the official document recommending Wang to succeed as supervisor of students studying in Japan was sent to the Executive Yuan and will be decided after the administrative meeting on the 25th, and then appointed by the National Government.</p>
<h3>Talk on Education Programs</h3>

The morning session, beginning at 9:00 AM, discussed the draft of the Overseas Chinese Education Program (this program was compiled based on the resolutions of the Overseas Chinese Education Conference convened by the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee in the 18th year and the Education Ministry's Work Allocation Table for the Period of Political Tutelage [Development of Overseas Chinese Education]). The chapters and sections of the draft, such as Chapter 1 on the goals of Overseas Chinese Education, various organizational provisions, various financial provisions, various accounting provisions, various school education provisions, and various social education sections regarding Overseas Chinese schools and students, were discussed one by one. Some were passed as is, while others were slightly modified, and the entire text was passed. The committee will then solicit opinions from various members by letter, and the committee will organize and decide. The afternoon session discussed the Higher Education Program, and only the full text of the plan to strengthen national universities was discussed and decided. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM and is scheduled to continue on the 22nd to discuss the unfinished Higher Education Program and the finalized version of the Secondary Education Program and the Social Education Program from the previous meeting.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders Suspension</h3>
<p>Private Surveying and Mapping Engineering College The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is currently strictly cracking down on不良 private schools in the city. It has now been found that the private Surveying and Mapping Engineering College is poorly managed and has been instructed to suspend operations immediately.

The person in charge of the college is always behind closed doors, and only a child of about ten years old who speaks Cantonese issues regulations from the window hole. There are no registered students, and the organization and equipment listed in the brochure are actually useless. The college is so poorly managed that it exaggerates in its brochures and other printed materials, behaving like a fraud. It should be ordered to suspend operations immediately. Recruitment advertisements and all printed materials must not be distributed again. This order is hereby issued for compliance and immediate suspension of operations to be reported. This order.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association</h3>
<p>West-Qing Wins Championship – Yesterday's Results –</p>
<p>(A) West-Qing 49...East-West 32 (A) Qing-Guang 47...Friendship-Love 22</p>
<p>(B) Tu-Jin 72...Shang-Chu 17</p>
<p>(B) 33-33...3-Yi 23 The Shanghai Basketball Association held four group matches last night, two each in A and B. The West-Qing vs. East-West match was crucial. If West-Qing won, they would get the championship. If East-West won, there would still be an exceptional final match. As a result, West-Qing overcame East-West with a score of 49 to 32, thus winning the championship. Watching East-West's performance last night, it was quite lackluster. The guard Lu Zhongen was as steady as ever, but everything else was very flustered.</p>
<p>The forwards had no connection, and the score always succumbed to West-Qing, failing to show any promise. In the first half, West-Qing had 27 points, while East-West had only 14 points. At the beginning of the second half, the situation was still good, but then He Tong left the field due to a foot injury, and the strength became even weaker, resulting in defeat. The referee was Xu Zhendong, and the inspector was Shao Ji.</p>

<h3>Xie Jin Association Seeks Far Eastern Games</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's Group A Match</h3>
<p>Lehua Wins Against Navy ▲Result: Two to One ▲Performances Were Terrible Fuyi, Lehua team, with its temporary talent, and the Navy team, with its flat and incapable skills, are in a contest, and it can be seen that its soldiers and horses are strong, promoting martial arts and showing off power, sweeping thousands of troops, and dominating for a time. Who knew that in the ninety minutes of fighting, the Navy's momentum was initially weak and then strong, while Lehua's sharpness was initially strong and then weak. Fortunately, Captain Li made contributions first, so that the entire team did not fail completely. Otherwise, the future of the Group A championship would be unimaginable. What is hoped for from Lehua in the future is that, regardless of the size of the battle, regardless of the strength of the enemy, they should rely on their individual strength and the spirit of the entire team to move forward aggressively and work hard. If they win, it is gratifying, and even if they lose, they will have honor. Hopefully, they will not underestimate the enemy and become arrogant, and tend towards disappointment, as they did yesterday.</p>
<p>On this day, Kang Haner, a sailor from Zhongshui, played for the Navy. He was burly and good at fighting, but his skills were mediocre and not surprising. The previous shooting was not at all sure, and the rear defense was even more chaotic. If Lehua could exert its full strength and show its prowess, then this small pawn would not be worth looking forward to. Among the Navy's eleven players, the best was Zhonglu Kais, whose solo charge to seize the base was the reason for not losing completely.</p>
<p>▲Lehua Team Lineup</p>
<p>Chen Bingxiang Li Shouhua Chen Lin Li Huitang Zhou Xianyan Sun Sijing Dai Linjing Li Ning An Yuansheng Chen Jiaqiu Xi Qiaosheng ▲Navy Team Lineup Shi Shentuo Ao Pei Er Shi Maoertou Qiao Po Laya Kais</p>
<p>Pei Tuo Meng De Fei Jia Zhuanzheng ▲A Thunderclap on Flat Ground Referee Ke Pu blew the whistle, and nearly ten thousand spectators craned their necks and looked forward. Thousands of eyes followed the ball. Initially, Lehua started the battle against the wind, advancing deeper. Soon, the army counterattacked, but retreated without effect. Then, Zhong Dai Linjing obtained the ball and passed it to Li. Li Huitang played a trick, confusing people's ears and eyes, changing from left to right, and went straight to take it. His left foot rose and shot into the left side of the goal. A thunderclap on flat ground shocked all the Chinese and Western men and women in the garden, and they cheered endlessly.</p>
<p>▲A Dose of Stimulant The victory and defeat of the two teams were already clear, and the situation became flat. Lehua learned that the opponent's skills were limited, so they used their skills, applying their own tricks, tilting to the left and right, as if playing with them in the palm of their hands, playing between their legs. The desire to advance decreased, and the ambition to strive weakened, so that in the back-and-forth, there were few surprising performances. The audience in the garden, as if entering a sleepy village, almost regarded the athletes of the two teams as playing children's games. Thirty-five minutes of good time passed in the blink of an eye. At that time, Li Huitang made a comeback, advancing lightly and quickly, cleverly avoiding enemies all the way, breaking through difficulties with wisdom, running unimpeded, leisurely and comfortably. Finally, the figure and the ball entered the net at the same time. Then, thousands of spectators, as if taking a dose of stimulant, applauded and shouted, rising from all sides, to express their elation. In the first half, Lehua two, Navy zero. ▲Great Disappointment from the Audience After changing formations and fighting again, Lehua, with the help of the wind, first launched a strong attack. Li Huitang picked from the side to the center, passing through the crowd. Xi Qiaosheng took over, kicking up a foot, but with weak strength and weak momentum, it was blocked by the goalkeeper. Left winger Shi Weituo attacked the ball and went straight along the line, passing a ball in the middle. Zhou Xianyan suddenly rushed up to capture it. If he had been a little negligent, Zhonglu Kaen had been prepared, then within five steps, there would have been a disaster. Great is this move, and together with Li Huitang, they were the heroes of Lehua's victory that day. Afterwards, Lehua's internal and external troubles arose repeatedly, either suffering from exhaustion or being injured and unable to walk. The entire team gradually had a gloomy scene, lacking a spirit of revitalization. Looking back at the Navy, it was like the rising sun, with thousands of sights. The trend of the army, the momentum of ten thousand, was due to the loss of shooting, wasting opportunities. In addition, Zhou Xianyan's defense was tight, with no opportunity to take advantage of. Otherwise, Lehua's supreme honor would have been destroyed in one fell swoop. However, the Navy repeatedly attacked and always worked hard. In the last ten minutes, they finally got their due reward. Zhongfeng Kaen went deep into the enemy alone, having gone through several lines of defense, and scored a goal. After this, Lehua's storms continued, but fortunately Li Ning, Sun Sijing, Chen, Li Huitang and others worked hard to persevere, and managed to maintain the final result of two to one victory.</p>
<h3>City Games Special Issue Printed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City City Games will issue a special issue at the time of the meeting to promote sports and encourage the spirit of athletes. It is heard that the collection of manuscripts is handled by Mr. Chen Yuze. The content includes the inaugural speech, essays, sports order, sports results, and other categories. Many good works have already been prepared. Sports experts who have great works to publish can send them to the Education Bureau immediately so that they can be edited and printed.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Games Japan and the Philippines Are Prepared</h3>
<p>▲Our Country's Tennis Championship Is Difficult to Maintain ▲Lin Baohua Failed at the Carnival Annual Meeting ▲Bui's Ball Skills Are Good, Harada Will Appear ▲Japan's Volleyball Efforts to Train to Wipe Out Past Humiliation (1) Japan Announces Volleyball Players The Japanese volleyball representatives for the 9th Far Eastern Games have now been decided, and the Japanese Selection and Evaluation Committee has announced the list. The names and school affiliations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Nakamura, Take, Ebata, Inoue, Murata, Yasu, Fujimura, Koi Tian, Port,</p>
<p>Saeki (above are from Kobe University of Commerce), Goto, Kawabata (above are from Kagawa Normal University), Akagi, Masao (above are from Hiroshima Second Middle School), Sakagami (Japanese Gymnastics), Imai (Meiji University), O, Nehashi (above are from Aichi Eighth High School), Murayama (Ikebukuro Normal University), Kojima (Hiroshima Higher Normal School), Taniyama (Wu Naval School) This time, Japan's volleyball players were selected from both Kanto and Kansai. All the players will undergo intensive training in Takamatsu City starting from February 20th. The training period is expected to be two months. In the end, the elite will be selected to participate in the tournament to wipe out the shame of Shanghai. (According to the 8th General Assembly, the Japanese army lost in volleyball) Currently, the Japanese are no less skilled than our country in volleyball tactics. When the Shanghai Fudan volleyball team went on an expedition to the east last year, they suffered a disastrous defeat in the first battle against Kobe University of Commerce. Fortunately, they won in the second battle, and the third time they drew. If our country does not practice quickly for this tournament, the future may be pessimistic.</p>
<p>(2) Philippine Track and Field and Swimming Athletes In order to select athletes to participate in the Far Eastern Games, the Philippines held a national aquatic and land sports competition on the 15th and 16th of this month on Canior Island.

<p>Lin Baohua, a famous figure, during the previous tournament, because the Japanese tennis king Harada had not returned from Europe, the Japanese tennis representatives who participated in the tournament were Buis and others, but Buis was not Lin's opponent, so our country won. After being humiliated, Bui worked hard to wash away his shame for more than two years, practicing every day, and also went to Europe and the United States to compete. On the 17th of this month, Lin and Bui met at the Philippine Carnival Annual Meeting, so the two immediately fought a bloody battle on the field. Unexpectedly, after two years as one day, the sea has changed to mulberry fields, and Lin was defeated by Bui. The Japanese side received this telegram and were all extremely happy, predicting that Japan would definitely win against China this time. The results of the bloody battle in Malaysia are recorded below:</p>
<p>Bui (Japan) 6-1 6-0 5-7 6-0 Lin Baohua (China) Qiu Feihai (China) 6-1 7-5 6-8 7-5 Shan Zhishi (Philippines) This time, in the tennis war, our country is afraid that it will be difficult to win, because the Japanese tennis king Harada will also return to participate. Lin had previously fought Harada twice, and was defeated both times. The first time was at Koshien in Japan (1928), and the second time was in Singapore (this year).</p>

<h3>Mr. Wu Zhihui's Interesting Anecdotes Upon Arriving in Changzhou</h3>
<p>— Wen Gui</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, an important figure in the party and the country, came to Changzhou on the 18th as the officiant for the marriage of his cousin, Ms. Ke Xiu, and Zhao Liancheng. Here are some interesting anecdotes that were recorded.</p>
<p>After Mr. Wu arrived in Changzhou, he toured the streets for a week and then stayed at the Huashang Hotel, using the pseudonym Wu Hanqing. In the evening, a friend, Zhu Zhongchao, sent a news reporter to visit. Wu refused to meet them. The friends repeatedly requested from across the door. Wu replied that he had already gone to bed and had completely taken off his clothes. If you have anything to say, talk tomorrow, I can't open the door.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, Mr. Wu went to the eastern suburbs to visit Tianning Temple and Wenbi Pagoda. At Tianning Temple, he saw a monk angrily questioning a monk and beating him severely. At the top of Wenbi Pagoda, he wrote an article titled "Old Tricks from Sixty Years Ago," which contained many interesting anecdotes, detailing how the monks of the temple should not be so bureaucratic and how the Bodhisattva should be sad, etc. This article was handed over to Fan Baizhu, a reporter from the Zhongshan Daily, for publication.</p>
<p>When asked whether Mr. Wu was from Changzhou or Wuxi, Wu replied that he grew up in Wujin, so of course he was from Wujin. However, he speaks with a Wuxi accent, so he can be said to be from Wuxi. He has lived in Shanghai for more than ten years, so he can also be said to be from Shanghai. In short, in terms of nationality, I am a Chinese. After saying that, he laughed loudly.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's speech at the wedding was full of wit and humor. He briefly stated that he had come to Changzhou today to say a few words in Changzhou dialect. The Zhao family of Daixi Bridge and the Wu family of Xueyan Bridge are old relatives.</p>
<p>Now they have formed a new relationship. In the future, I hope they will continue to form relationships.</p>
<p>Zhao Liancheng has studied abroad for many years and has also studied well. My cousin's scholarship is excellent, so she was named Ke Xiu. It can be said to be a happy marriage. Now everything is progressing. People from the countryside also come to the city to get married. Heneige, people from the countryside, come to the city to get married. This is something to be proud of.</p>
<p>I just said I was going to speak Changzhou dialect, but I can't say it. Now I can only mix Wuxi, Changzhou, and Suzhou dialects to say it. Today, the Wu family's and the Zhao family's two families are getting married. I still have a blessing to say, which is "Many sons and many grandsons."</p>
<p>After Mr. Wu finished his business, he went to the train station at 5:00 PM that afternoon to leave. He first bought two train tickets for Shanghai and Nanjing. When catching the train, it was the 5:15 PM down train. It was probably going towards Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu and his friend Duan Mengtao talked about airplanes. He said that he had flown twice. Before the first flight, he thought it would be difficult to fly. In fact, it is not much different from being on the ground.</p>
<p>It is also very stable after sitting, and you can write or walk on it. I flew, and Hu Zhantang scolded me. He said that he always thought that you Wu Zhihui had flown ten years ago. Unexpectedly, you are only flying for the first time today, etc. There is also a type of airplane that costs 50,000 US dollars, which is equivalent to 100,000 yuan in Chinese currency. It can hold ten seats, has a rest area, and has a writing desk. This type of airplane.</p>
<p>I once advised Chiang Kai-shek to buy one. For example, if you want to go to Guangzhou, you can get there in ten hours.</p>
<h3>Talking about Fengyang, the Relics of Hongwu</h3>
<p>— Wang Dingjiu</p>
<p>Fengyang is a household in northern Anhui. It is the hometown of Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of the Ming Dynasty. There are many scenic spots and beautiful stories. Fellow member Mr. Wu has been teaching in Fengyang for seven years. Last year, he returned to Shanghai for vacation.</p>
<p>The members of the society held a banquet for him in a restaurant. At the table, we talked about the story of Hongwu.</p>
<p>There is much to record. Therefore, I write to tell the readers of Free Talk.</p>
<p>▲Huge Iron Woks Three miles outside the North Gate of Fengcheng, in the fields, there are five incomparably huge iron woks. According to legend, there were years of famine due to war. There was famine in northern Anhui. Emperor Ming cared about the people's difficulties, so he ordered officials to set up porridge here for disaster relief. The iron woks were used to cook porridge. It is said that each wok of porridge was enough for 500 people to fill their stomachs. From this, it can be seen how huge its volume is. Legend has it that a novice monk from a certain temple was watching by the wok when cooking porridge. He accidentally fell into it. At that time, everyone was at a loss. After three days, the porridge in the wok was exhausted, and a pile of white bones was found at the bottom of the pot. It was heard that a novice monk had also disappeared from a neighboring temple. Only then did they know that he had suffered this tragic death.</p>
<p>▲Closing the Door Is Already Daybreak Hongwu came from a commoner background. He lost his parents at a young age. He was once a monk at Huanglong Temple. The temple is a large temple in Fengyang. The temple is magnificent. According to legend, the temple occupied more than 100 acres during the Ming Dynasty. There were dozens of gates. The mountain gate was locked at night. This was done in order to sequentially lock towards the back gate. When entering, Ming was the head. When exiting, the east was already white. The scope was so wide. The temple has suffered since Hong Yang. Only one-tenth of what remains today exists.</p>
<p>▲Hongwu's Sword Millet in Front of His Mother's Tomb Hongwu's tomb was built in the capital. It is based on Purple Mountain, sharing immortality with President Sun. His parents' tomb is in his old hometown. It is six miles from the city. There are many northern things in the north. It is everywhere. When Hongwu was a swaddling infant, his mother spread diapers on it. He felt the sword millet prick his hand, so he said angrily. Why not face down for the convenience of people?</p>
<p>What is the reason for looking up? After saying that, the sword millet faced down. The matter was heard by the public.</p>
<p>Everyone was surprised. Then they realized that Hongwu was no ordinary person. Later, he became emperor.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years have passed. In the land of Mingling, the sword millet that grows there all has its thorns facing down. This is also an oddity.</p>
<h3>Securities Flat Electricity 96 Continues to Fall (Beiping) In the morning, the spot market opened at 168, closed at 167, with sales of 230,000. In the afternoon, the market opened at 166, peaked at 1665, with sales of 295,000. (Telegraphic dispatch of the 22nd) Bond prices fluctuate. Yesterday, the local securities market was very quiet. The morning transaction volume was less than 1.5 million yuan, and the afternoon volume was more than 3 million yuan. Among them, the most traded were the post-reorganization bonds and continued issues, each accounting for more than 800,000 yuan. Customs duties accounted for only more than 700,000 yuan. The remaining entire six continued issues 25 accounted for only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. The financial situation of the 1967 issue was the clearest. Only the continued issues 25, post-reorganization bonds, and customs duties each opened at 1,000 yuan, and the others did not open. The calmness of the traders' sentiment has been described above. Bond prices also remained stagnant as before, fluctuating only by a few corners throughout the day. As a result, continued issues 25, post-reorganization bonds, and continued issues slightly increased, while other bonds fluctuated. The bond market is temporarily without significant fluctuations.

The yarn market remains weak, actual sales are sluggish, and sentiment is softening. However, the market can still maintain its stability because those who profited after the large drop have somewhat hedged their short positions. New sellers are now relatively scarce. Some in the industry are looking for a rebound in February and March. Therefore, the situation is fluctuating. Large buyers remain inactive. However, the liquidation of spot yarn is too slow, and it is very difficult for the market to turn around. ▲ The "Ren Biao" brand, which is close to delivery, rises slightly due to short covering. The "Ren Biao" market opened with a downward trend in foreign cotton prices, and sentiment was flat. Small sellers sold off, causing prices for each month to fall by five to six qian. In the second session, some who had profited covered their short positions, causing prices to rise by four to five qian. However, the Number 66 added to the selling pressure, resulting in prices for each month rising or falling by one, two, three, or five qian. In the afternoon, the "Ren Biao" yarn market remained weak due to weak demand for spot yarn. However, there were more short-covering activities for the current month, causing prices to rise by three to five qian, while distant months fell by one, two, or four qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 15,550 bales. The closing prices of "Ren Biao" are recorded on the left. Closing Prices for "Ren Biao": Increase/Decrease; Remaining Balance May: 1529, Down 3, 25,900 February: 1570, Up, 419,750 June: 1530, 218,250 March: 1545..., 43,000 July: 1529, 2, 12,000 April: 1533, Down 4, 40,000 ▲ Spot Yarn Sales are Relatively Clear. Yesterday, various groups bought only 340 bales. Colleagues purchased 1,400 bales of futures yarn for delivery on a later date. The market was weak. The largest purchases were made by inland groups, totaling 95 bales. In addition, the Sichuan group purchased 40 bales, the Jiangxi group 40 bales, the Niuzhuang group 25 bales, the Qinhuangdao group 45 bales, the Hankou group 50 bales, the Paris group 25 bales, and miscellaneous groups 20 bales. The sales openings are listed in detail in the price list. Cotton Market with Sluggish Actual Sales.</h3>
<p>Cotton Market: Morning Weakness, Afternoon Rise. However, actual sales are very sluggish. Factories have absorbed enough Indian cotton, so there is no need to purchase Chinese cotton. Hankou merchants are holding on tightly to spot cotton and are also buying long positions in the futures market. In short, sales are poor, and the future is unlikely to be stable. ▲ Cotton Futures Fall and Rise Again. The Hankou "Biao" market opened with a relatively weak trend, due to another drop in foreign cotton prices. Small sellers liquidated their positions, causing prices for each month to fall by five fen to one qian. In the afternoon, some purchases were made, and the market sentiment improved slightly, causing prices for each month to rise by five fen to one qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 32,400 dan. The closing prices of the Hankou "Biao" are recorded on the left. Hankou "Biao": Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Remaining Balance; Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Remaining Balance. 2: 3510, Up 15, 30,500; 5: 3425, Up 5, 69,600 3: 3455, 20, 63,100; 6: 3430, 10, 55,300 4: 3425, 5, 86,000; 7: 3435, 33,300 ▲ Actual Demand is Increasingly Scarce. Indian Cotton Business is Still Good. There Were No Transactions in Local Cotton. Sources at the Docks: Yao Cotton, 50 bales. Sales listings on the left. Flower 55.70 The Dakang Factory purchased 200 pieces. The ship was loaded and sent to the factory immediately. Also 54.75 Also 500 pieces Also Also Australia La 52.50 Also 500 pieces Also Also Overseas Yarn and Cotton Continue to Trend Downstream. ▲ American Cotton Long Positions Liquidate, Continuing Weakness. Yesterday, the American cotton market was firm. At the close of trading, due to long position liquidation and poor spot prices, the market suddenly turned weak. Futures fell by 9 to 10 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 4 points, and spot prices rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was quiet and firm. Pingguoer near and far term rose by 1 rupee, Oumula near and far term unchanged, Bairoxi near and far term rose by 1 rupee.

The New York Telegram of the 21st Reported the Cotton Market Situation for the Past Week: Observing the actions of the cotton market, it can be seen that until the issue of new cotton acreage is resolved, the industry and cooperatives will likely not provide active assistance above a price of 1.06 yuan. This situation can be further seen in the increase in sellers when yarn prices rose slightly this week. There were indeed several companies that bought at limited prices every day this week, but in general, this type of buying only occurs when prices fall. There is better news regarding progress in agricultural work, and there is also an indication of increased fertilizer sales. In addition, wheat prices are weak. These are all reasons for the decline in cotton prices. Promotion to reduce cotton acreage is still underway. However, although cotton farmers have been warned not to overproduce cotton, they are still tending to increase cotton acreage due to hopes that the Agricultural Bureau will protect cotton prices. Therefore, many believe that this trend still needs to be overcome through promotion. Also, demand for spot cotton is slow, other goods are falling in price, and cotton cloth transactions are sluggish. It is expected that American cotton consumption will greatly decrease. Government actions remain uncertain. Due to these several factors, speculation is scarce. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales): Previous Week Last Week Cumulative Listing This Season 12,816 12,964 Cumulative Factory Use Since August 1 4,869 4,986 Cumulative Exports Since August 1 5,218 5,323 To Japan 763 781 To China 131 143 To England 1,047 1,067 To Germany 1,394 1,410 New York Inventory 98 98 Inventory at Various Ports and Towns 3,598 3,520 Worldwide Supply 8,088 8,986 American Cotton Included 5,395 5,267 American Cotton Utilization Worldwide Since August 9,175 9,451 Food Rice Market: High Stability, Subsequent Weakness. ▲ Zhabei: Yesterday's market sales were sluggish. The arrival of goods from inland areas was relatively strong, accounting for about 40%. High-quality Northern Japonica rice remained unchanged, while medium and lower qualities fell by half a corner. High-quality green rice was scarce, while ordinary quality was abundant. In addition, sales were weak at all stalls, so prices were suppressed by buyers. Sales of thin rice were slow, and overall prices softened slightly. Although top-quality "Yang Xian" rice was stable, medium and lower qualities had to be reduced by one or two corners. Buying sentiment was quiet. "Du Zi Xian" and "Ke Bu Xian" rice were about half a corner cheaper. Retail sales on this street were not quiet. Sentiment among green importers has turned weak. As the next batch of cargo ships is about to arrive, the market sentiment for various goods is poor. ▲ Shanghai South: About 20 ships arrived from inland areas. Sales on this street were mixed. "Changxi Jijiang" and "Sutong Baijiang" rice initially felt tight, and retail sales in stores were still available, but they soon weakened. As a result, overall prices remained flat, with only half a corner of fluctuation for high and medium qualities. Sales of thin rice from southern provinces were strong and did not linger. High-quality goods such as green corners were around 16 yuan, with a corner reduction. The situation for "Yang Xian" rice was flat, and rural villages continued to enter, stabilizing the market. "Du Zi" rice was scarce and inventory was thin. Merchants reported sales, and transactions were rare. "Tongbian Yinhua" rice remained active in appetite, and sources were also connected, with stable prices. Flour Market Turns Upward with Foreign Wheat. Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, each month saw signs of a rebound and firmness. Since the quoted price of foreign wheat has returned to about one yuan, the opening prices of each market have invisibly returned to be more than one point higher. However, in subsequent markets, the overall market revolved and there was not much difference. Because of the relationship with foreign wheat in the past week, it was ultimately in a sharp decline. The firm and expensive sentiment has already been impacted, so even though foreign wheat is good, the buying sentiment is ultimately not very smooth. Moreover, due to the pressing situation, if something happens in the north, the sales of flour will be greatly affected. Therefore, the future forecast depends half on the quotations from abroad, and half on how the situation turns around. As a result, this month is more than one point and two and a half cents better than the previous day, March is one and a half cents better, April is one point and two and a half cents better, May is one and a half cents better, June is seven and a half cents better, and July is one point and seven and a half cents better. Futures wheat buying sentiment remains strong, rebounding by two cents. Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, each month tended to be stable. The foreign wheat quotation has already returned to high, and the buying sentiment outside the industry is still strong, so transactions for each month are still very smooth. However, because the delivery of this month is approaching, both long and short sides are not interested in competing for the large position, resulting in a stable position at the current price of five taels, one qian, and five and a half cents. As a result of futures wheat, spot wheat is slightly stable. Special high-quality goods have been priced two or three cents higher, while medium and lower qualities remain flat. High-quality You Wheat opened at five taels, one qian, and six cents, Dongtai Wheat at five taels, one qian, and seven cents, Mingguang Linhuai Wheat opened at five taels and two cents, Yangzhou Hunan Wheat also opened at five taels, one qian, and half a cent, Zhenjiang Wheat at five taels and one qian, totaling 4,000 bags. Piece Goods: Poplin Sales Are Improving. The piece goods market trend was softer yesterday. Actual sales in the market were very quiet. Customer groups such as Sichuan were still stagnant. The Hankou group handled more than 100 pieces yesterday, mostly fine cloth and fine twill. The Jiangxi group was still active, with transactions of more than 200 pieces of bleached cloth and satin. The rest were scattered. The price of goods has fallen again. "Magpie Bridge Meeting" bleached cloth was 5 qian cheaper and sold for 9 taels and 2 qian. "Shile Bird" fine cloth was 2.5 qian cheaper and sold for 7 taels and 5.5 qian. More than 100 pieces of "Renmian" fine twill arrived at the beginning of the month and have now been sold. Straight tribute satin is increasingly prosperous. "Magpie Bridge Meeting" and "Wannian Youyu" goods for lower garments have all entered customs at 2 qian and 4 fen. "First Achievement" is priced very chaotically due to abundant inventory among experts, and a commission can now be deducted at 2 qian, 5 fen and 2.5 li. The price has fallen by 5 li in recent days. The influence of local products on printed cloth is quite strong, so small amounts are also seen. Western goods are still generally needed on this street. Poplin sales are gradually improving. Yesterday, "Anli Three Boys" opened at 3 qian and 6 fen, and "Fair Eight Diagrams" at 4 qian and 1 fen, and both were sold. Plain poplin with bald white is the most popular. There is little left in the market, and the demand from merchants and stores is particularly strong, so yesterday the market rose by about 1 fen. North-South Goods: Dried Longan Meat Prices Vary. Recently, the source of sun-dried dried longan meat has increased, and the price has turned down due to sluggish sales in various places. Yesterday, it was heard that the quoted price was no more than 40 taels, which was 2.5 taels lower than the previous market. The bottom inventory has not yet been cleared, and the trend is flat and weak. However, ordinary goods have better demand. Both arrival and inventory are lacking, and the market has turned tight. The quoted price has risen by half a tael, and the market price has followed higher. Moreover, the local price is unable to meet the exchange rate due to high exchange rates. Sugar Market: Raw Sugar, White Sugar Initially Rise, Then Decline. ▲ Arrival of Goods Increases... Sales Remain Sluggish. Yesterday, according to telegrams from sugar production areas, the current price of Cuban sugar was still 2.0625, New York futures sugar for March was 1.68, May was 1.78, each rising by 1 cent, September was 1.95, and December was 2.04, also rebounding by 3 cents. Both Java futures and spot sugar were unchanged. The association market quoted Dutch sugar No. 24 raw sugar, which saw a slight rebound due to industry maintenance. However, due to sluggish sales and an influx of arrivals, the situation suddenly suffered a setback, and there were few buyers. The market price yesterday was 7 taels and 1 qian and 5 fen, and transactions were very bleak, falling back 2.5 fen from the previous day. Ground fine white sugar was 7 taels and 2 qian and 2.5 fen, and No. 20 medium white sugar was 6 taels and 9 qian, with unremarkable market conditions. The import and export of Japanese sugar were also quiet, and the market price also fell at the same time. N-Mark was 7 taels and 5 qian and 2 fen, YT-Mark was 7 taels and 4 qian and 2.5 fen, YP-Mark was 7 taels and 6 qian and 2.5 fen, and the market also declined. J-Mark was quoted at 7 taels and 8 qian and 5 fen, with few inquiries. The quoted price for No. 3 dregs was more than 100 bags at 10 taels and 2 qian. Dutch ice sugar was also quoted for dozens of bags at 10 taels and 4 qian. Locally produced Mianhu red sugar opened at 38 bags, priced at 7 taels and 6 qian. Due to the severe shortage in the market, the price was high, but the market image still felt lively. Silk and Tea: The Tea Market Remains Quiet. The local foreign firm tea market has remained quiet recently. British and French firms have shown some interest in purchasing "Zhen Mei" pearl tea due to the low exchange rate. However, because most of the current inventory is medium and low-grade tea, it does not meet sales needs, so the market has not made any progress. In addition to small transactions of "Zhen Mei" and "Duan Mu" green tea, the rest are rare. As for Keemun black tea, British sales remain sluggish. It is uncertain when the Russian aid association, which is hoped for by the public, will come to Shanghai to open operations. European and American Demand for Chinese Silk Remains Strong. Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market tended to be stable and firm. It was found that European and American silk mills had large sales of spring goods, and the demand for silk remained strong. The remaining goods from Chinese merchants were scarce, and prices were increasingly favorable. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and other firms imported 40 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, Xinfu imported 30 packages of Shandong silk, and Samsung imported 10 packages of coarse yellow silk, all at firm prices.

<h3>Caozhou Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Caozhou is located west of Jining. Since ancient times, it has been a place contended for by military strategists and a shield for Shandong Province. My friend, Qian Ziyuanru, once served as the director of academic affairs at Liuzhong. Upon his return, he spoke in detail about the situation there. I will briefly record it to inform the readers.</p>
<p>Caozhou was a prefecture during the Qing Dynasty. However, upon arriving there, one sees barrenness everywhere. The streets are strangely narrow. The city is not even as good as the larger cities in Jiangsu Province. The local customs are fierce. Many of the people are skilled in martial arts. The strongman performances that we see in Shanghai are amazing.</p>
<p>In Caozhou, this is nothing extraordinary. Once, a soldier clashed with a student. Several soldiers attacked the student together, but they were defeated by him and fled like rats.</p>
<p>Many residents of Caozhou have a smoking addiction. Five or six out of ten shops in the market sell cigarettes. Most of them smoke the Hademen brand. The annual consumption is truly alarming. The currency used for transactions is mostly double copper coins. One silver dollar can be exchanged for three thousand cash. The cost of living is very low, so expenses here are extremely low. The most important products are fruits, such as pears and peaches, which are large and sweet. Each piece costs only twenty or thirty cash. There are many fruit trees. Guests can pick and eat them without interference, but they cannot take them away. If they could be transported to Shanghai, the price would multiply. In Caozhou, men and women still adhere to the ancient custom of not touching hands when giving or receiving. When women walk on the road, men are not allowed to stare at them. Those who are slightly inattentive will be beaten by the crowd. Those who arrive there for the first time often do not know this, so many people are beaten. When entering a country, one must ask about its customs.</p>
<p>The residents are simple, honest, and quick to learn but slow to acquire wealth. They greatly respect teachers. Every morning at five o'clock, one can hear the sound of reading. Persimmon frost, a type of local product, is extremely effective in treating hemorrhoids.</p>
<h3>Where Did the Wild Mandarin Ducks Fly From?</h3>
<p>— Lan Yin</p>
<p>The other day, at the home of Huan Liu in Mingxing Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, a pair of unfamiliar wild mandarin ducks were found in the downstairs厢房, enjoying a good dream. The downstairs 厢房 was rented by a carpenter named Chen. Chen goes out to work every day and does not close the door. On this day, Huan Liu returned from buying groceries and suddenly saw the door of the 厢房 tightly closed, which aroused her suspicion. She peeked through the crack in the door and discovered a man and a woman sleeping together. She called the police to arrest them. It is truly a rare and absurd story that wild mandarin ducks would dare to enter someone's house for a secret rendezvous. Unexpectedly, there was another similar incident. Yesterday, at the Hua family's home on Gongping Road, a similar situation occurred. The Hua family lives in the front building with only a husband, wife, and daughter. The husband works at a company and leaves early and returns late. The wife is addicted to mahjong and spends her days visiting neighbors to play. The daughter is still young and likes to stay with her mother. At that time, the wife was strolling in the bamboo grove and instructed her daughter to guard the house. Before long, the daughter also left the house to join her mother. When they returned after the game, they found the door locked from the inside. They were shocked and screamed. Inside the room was a pair of wild mandarin ducks, floating in bliss between life and death. Hearing the noise, they were also startled. They hurriedly opened the door, and neither the man nor the woman was recognized. They looked at each other in astonishment, their faces flushed with the warmth of spring.</p>
<p>The expressions in their eyes and eyebrows told a story. The wife could not help but make a scene. The wild mandarin ducks were even more embarrassed. Amid the shouting and scolding, a certain man surnamed Mou, who rented the back building, returned from outside. The man rushed to him. Mou asked in surprise what was happening. The man stammered that he had entered the wrong room and begged for help. It turned out that the man and Mou were from the same hometown. One day, they met on the road, and the man learned Mou's address. He had brought his mistress to visit him, but mistakenly entered the front building. For a moment, they were overcome with desire due to lust and laughter, thinking that Mou was a good friend and had not brought his family to Shanghai. They thought it would be fine to temporarily enjoy a moment of pleasure. Who knew that it would turn out to be such an embarrassing scandal? In the end, Mou mediated and ordered them to light candles and burn incense in the room to ward off bad luck, and the matter was settled. Compared to the wild mandarin ducks in Zhabei, who were sentenced to fifteen days of detention by the police, they got off easy.</p>
<h3>Clever Dog</h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>My neighbor, surnamed Zhu, has a dog. It is very clever.</p>
<p>It always tries to please its master. One day,</p>
<p>the dog suddenly developed an eye disease. Pus filled its eyes, and it was about to go blind. The family hired a doctor to treat it. The doctor said, "I'll try treating it with medicine for humans first. If it doesn't work, I'll try a better method." So, he had the dog lie down beside him and applied the medicine. The medicine was strong, and the dog barked wildly in pain, but it did not run away. After a while, the condition improved greatly. The next day, the doctor came again. The dog wagged its head and tail, as if expressing joy and gratitude. Then, it lowered its head to the doctor, just like a human. After the medicine was applied, it lingered and looked around, not leaving for even a short distance. It waited until the doctor left and escorted him to the door before stopping. This happened three or four times. Everyone praised it as a clever dog.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (42)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲ The Death of Bourdelle</p>
<p>Three, His Art (Part 2)</p>
<p>Rodin created "The Man in Action" and "The Thinker." He loved to use strong, nervous muscles, realizing them in the movements of his sculptures. It seems to be a kind of "power" and "thought," its radiant aura shining throughout the universe. His sublime and magical talent, along with the powerful expressiveness of his human figures, lifted him above the major flaws in his own art. Many of his students only wanted to make themselves strange and peculiar, and thus they committed these serious mistakes, merely changing the form while lacking any substance. Even the materials used for sculpture were completely ignored. These signs of decline inspired Bourdelle to pursue the permanence of ancient civilizations. From Michelangelo, he realized that the sculptor's task was not to carve a beautiful exterior but to create solemn and powerful forms from rough stone. Therefore, after long deliberation and exploration, Bourdelle finally made new discoveries. He paid great attention to the materials of sculpture without being confined by them. While pursuing new forms of expression, he also carefully avoided their dangers. Rodin also did not hide his admiration for his talented student.</p>
<p>"Bourdelle seeks 'truth' through relentless reasoning, abandoning the old for the new without hesitation or regret. His works are extremely rational. Every detail has its reason for existence and important value in the whole. There are no accidental discoveries, no repetitions, and no awkward parts. His lines are precise and composed, not because of a lack of talent but because of his synthetic necessity." You see, this is his evaluation of his technique. There is nothing more to add or argue about. However, Bourdelle is not like other "constructivists." He does not suppress the excitement of emotion; he only knows how to control it.</p>
<p>Bourdelle was influenced by various sources, but he always maintained his own identity. He transformed the forms he gained from Rome, Greece, Babylon, and Egypt through his own mind. Because of this, he was able to combine the movement of modern art with the sanctity of Aegean culture, the greatness of the Renaissance, and the tranquility of Olympia. On this point, great artists are a thousand times greater than glorious warriors who die on the battlefield. Because war gives us the impression of hatred, while artists leave behind works that inspire people to know more about gratitude, love, and beauty. True beauty shines among the stars and can never be erased.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Snippets</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>When carrying a large amount of money, you should wear shabby clothes. I have seen young people become proud and arrogant,</p>
<p>showing off huge wads of cash when shopping, not realizing that it could lead to a deadly disaster. Being robbed is a minor matter. During this period of late books, when buying books at large bookstores such as the Commercial Press, you should go when they first open at nine in the morning; otherwise, you will have to wait a long time.</p>
<p>Exchanging silver dollars near a streetcar station will definitely cause you to lose a few copper coins.</p>
<p>Buying cheap goods on the street will guarantee that you will be swindled. Buying cigarettes on a ship will guarantee that you will get fake goods.</p>
<p>If you are not greedy for wealth or beauty, no matter how dangerous the sea is, you will never fall into the trap.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Confused and Unclear Silver Loan Market ▲Market Overview The price of silver loans fluctuates with the difference in supply and demand. A slight delay causes it to fall, and a slight advantage causes it to rise. Although it cannot be considered a spiral trend, a state of confusion and uncertainty is undeniably the reality. For example, yesterday's market first rose and then fell, and the difference was minimal. People's minds remained indecisive, with inconsistent views on whether to be bullish or bearish. In reality, there is no opportunity for rapid growth at present, but there is also no ability for a sharp decline.</p>
<p>▲Silver Loan Prices In the early market, sentiment was quite bullish, so temporary asking prices were mostly above two cents. However, with sellers unwilling to act, the result was a soft market, so the closing price was 71.9875 cents, a decrease of 0.0125 cents compared to the previous day. The fluctuations were minimal, and trading was normal. The supply of silver for loans remained abundant, with no worries of depletion. The market remained loose. The market price for borrowing, bank rates, and the rates for big accounts were not announced.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions Jiangnan small silver coins gradually weakened, yesterday at 62.1 cents, a further decrease of 0.2 cents compared to the previous day. The total decrease this week was 1.6 cents. Transactions amounted to 11,000 small silver dollars. Guangdong small silver coins remained strong, rising another half a cent yesterday, amounting to 59.925 cents. It is said that if the Dalian gang continues to buy, the market price will have to be raised further. Transactions amounted to 100,500 small silver dollars. Copper coins rose slightly by 500 cash, amounting to 398,500 cash.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow Regarding "silver funds," banks received fewer collections at the end of the week, so yesterday was very simple. Chinese merchants received collections of over 1.3 million, foreign merchants 800,000 to 900,000, and various goods, taxes, and miscellaneous collections were only over 5 million. Outflow was 600,000. Japanese banks received collections of over 2.2 million for various items, and outflow was 300,000. Money shops and silver firms received collections of over 21.1 million, and big account collections were over 1.8 million. Foreign exchange collections were over 500,000, and cash receipts were 800,000 to 900,000. Regarding "foreign funds," foreign exchange transactions in the early market amounted to 1,055,000, and there was no market in the afternoon. There were no transactions in banknotes. Off-market transactions amounted to 78,000, and banks bought and sold 900,000.</p>
<p>The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts in various banks was over 700,000, loans to money shops were over 800,000, and foreign big account collections were over 900,000. Money shops and silver firms received collections of over 2.3 to 2.4 million, and small money shop transactions were over 400,000.</p>
<h3>Fluctuating Gold Prices</h3>
<p>▲Fluctuating Around 490 Taels Yesterday was Saturday, and gold trading was only conducted for half a day in the morning market. The gold market fluctuated up and down, but ultimately softened. Overall, it was difficult to break the spiral trend, and it remained around the 490 tael mark, with fluctuations of about four taels. The opinions of those in the industry were divided and uncertain, and trading was not active. It was difficult to buy large quantities, and it was also not easy to sell if there were many sellers. Regarding foreign exchange, the rate was raised by one level, but internally it was stable. Some in the industry sold, and the gold market initially fell in the morning due to the high rate for large amounts. Later, buyers seemed eager, and prices rose steadily, breaking through the 490 tael mark. However, at noon, sellers became active, foreign exchange eased, and the market atmosphere was poor, abruptly cutting two taels, with the final price at 489 taels.</p>
<p>▲Silver Bar Rate Increased, Benchmark Gold Was Still Good at 400 Cash The price of silver bars had increased by 16/32, and the price of silver increased by 8/32. The exchange rate remained unchanged. Therefore, the gold price for April opened down 700 cash, at 488 taels 200 cash. It was later only 487 taels 300 cash, and the gross rate was raised again by two taels. Because the foreign exchange rate strengthened, the Nikkei rate was first 1.0175 taels at the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>Then it bought 1.02 taels. Mitsui bought 1.01875 taels in April, and then bought Citibank for a long-term contract at 48.375 yuan. When the settlement rate was announced, it was 489 taels 120 cash. Although the listed rate increased by 25,</p>
<p>the US dollar increased by 500 cash, and the Nikkei rate decreased by 100 cash, which did not cause much movement. The rate was 488 taels 900 cash. Suddenly, the trend seemed to rise, and the foreign exchange rate improved. The Nikkei Silver Company bought 1.02125 taels in April and also bought British gold at 11/64. There was also buying of the Zhengjin rate until it reached 490 taels at 10 o'clock. At this time, some retail accounts sold, and the price decreased by one tael. After 10:30, banks traded British gold for May at 11/64. The buying sentiment seemed strong, rising steadily. At 11:15, it rose to 491 taels 200 cash. Later, the Dalian gang and Zhifeng Yong and others sold. The Nikkei rate softened, and it was not easy to sell long-term Nikkei at 1.02125 taels. Therefore, the gold price broke through the 490 tael mark again and suddenly fell to 489 taels 200 cash at noon. The closing price was 489 taels 300 cash, a rebound of 400 cash compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>▲Inconsistent Actions of the Dalian Gang The maximum price for half a day was 491 taels 200 cash, and the minimum price was 487 taels 300 cash, a difference of 3.9 taels. The opening price of goods was 489 taels 200 cash, and the closing price was 489 taels 300 cash. The announced price was changed to 499 taels 200 cash. Because the Nikkei rate was listed down by 100 cash, it was still 10 taels lower. The registered rates for February and April were 489 taels, and for March it was 488 taels. The replenishment rate was 489 taels. The price of jewelry gold had decreased by 500 cash, calculated at 69.5 yuan. Trading among industry peers included Yu Da, Taixing, Yuansheng, Fuchang,</p>
<p>Yuanheng, Wanxing, etc., all of which sold. Hengxing, Shengda, and Bingxing bought a thousand several hundred bars. Yuan Yu Yong, Shunmao, Shunli, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, and hedging firms all bought. Zhifeng Yong and Dadecheng bought and then sold. Yuantai first sold and then bought. The actions of the Dalian gang were inconsistent. They sold 1,300 bars and bought 1,500 bars. The Cantonese gang had few transactions and were not active. The market closed in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Apparently Weak, Actually Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and foreign exchange trading only took place for half a day in the morning. The HSBC exchange rate increased by one level. The British exchange rate increased by 25 to 1 shilling and 1.5 pence, the US dollar increased by 500 cash to 47.625 yuan, India increased by 1.5 yuan to 131 rupees, France increased by 13 yuan to 1,216 yuan, and Germany increased by 2.5 yuan to 199.5 marks. Japanese currency increased by 1.25 yuan to 118.5 yuan, the Po currency decreased by 100 cash to 118.5 taels. The Japanese exchange rate decreased by 100 cash to 1.03375 taels. Hong Kong remained at 80 taels. Overseas telegrams reported that the Indian exchange rate increased by 1.06 rupees to 49 rupees, and there were no rises or falls in Yokohama and Kobe. The market was sluggish.</p>
<p>As for the internal market of local banks, various exchange rates were still stable. The market was slightly depressed in the morning,</p>
<p>but it tightened again as the gold price rebounded. By noon, it seemed to loosen, but the gold price had already fallen back below 490 taels. However, compared to the previous day, there was a slight improvement, with the British rate decreasing by .0625, the US dollar decreasing by 25, and the Japanese exchange rate increasing slightly by .0625. Regardless of whether the trend was apparently weak or actually strong, people's minds were uncertain, almost inversely proportional to the previous day. Some Chinese speculators sold slightly, with about 50,000 to 60,000 pounds of British currency sold. Banks were willing to buy, with Zhengjin, Tonghui, Shanghai, and Shiye making purchases. Banks also traded 20,000 to 30,000 pounds and 100,000 US dollars. As for the Cantonese gang, Shengda and others sold more than 100,000 yuan, which was purchased by Mitsui and Toa. The Japanese exchange rate was sold by the gold industry for more than 1 million yuan. Banks that bought included Sumitomo, Taiwan, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Tonghui. The Dalian gang sold several hundred thousand yuan to the current Dalian to hedge the gold price. However, the result was quiet.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Both Rebounded</h3>
<p>According to telegrams from London yesterday, the price of silver bars had both rebounded. The near-term rate increased by 1.875 to 20 pence, and the long-term rate also increased by 1.875 to 19.875 pence. Both China and India bought, but trading was not high. According to telegrams from New York, the price of American silver also rebounded by 0.375,</p>
<p>to 43.25 cents. The British rate against the US increased by .0625, and the US rate against the British remained unchanged at 4.8615625 yuan. The Japanese rate against the US remained unchanged at 49.1875 yuan, and the British rate against the Japanese increased by 0.03125 to 2.03125 shillings. The British rate against Shanghai remained unchanged at 2 shillings. Also, Reuters reported at 11:00 AM today that there were no increases or decreases, and the Dentus news agency reported that there were no changes.</p>
