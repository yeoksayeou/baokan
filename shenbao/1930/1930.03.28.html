<p>今日外電稱。埃及首相那哈司爲領袖之代表團抵英。頗受英人歡迎。埃首相＊</p>
<p>等此行。爲談判英埃懸案問題。所謂懸案者。即埃及獨立後所留遺之英埃條＊</p>
<p>約是。吾人甚望數年來紐結不解之英埃糾紛。能於此行一掃而空之也。</p>
<p>埃及之古文化。爲世界所艶稱。而期民族亦頗有堅强不屈之氣概。自經獨立＊</p>
<p>運動以來。犧牲實甚鉅大。英政府於大戰後。雖即承認其爲獨立國。於一九二＊</p>

<p>足埃人之意。然而埃人之反英運動。仍再接再厲而不已者。則爲名雖獨立。而＊</p>
<p>實際仍未能脫離英人之保護。蓋當准許埃及獨立之初。英曾聲明保留在埃＊</p>
<p>國境内駐軍·及由英負責保護内外人民命產·與承認蘇丹地位等四項。＊</p>
<p>故柴魯爾於一九二四年就第一任首相職後。即赴央交涉。並無絲毫效果而＊</p>
<p>返。於是埃人又與英大起衝突。相持至一九二八年。那哈司繼任組閣。英埃局＊</p>
<p>勢復起緊張。幸英工黨重行執政。對埃政策。稍稍變通。乃成立英埃間十六條＊</p>
<p>之草約。内容確稍讓步。然蘇彝士河之駐兵。蘇丹之繼續現狀。會審法庭之保＊</p>
<p>存等。仍未滿足埃人眞正完全獨立之意。因之英埃之糾紛。仍未能已。其後英＊</p>
<p>工黨雖復稍有所遷就。而埃人則以爲此皆枝葉。而非根本解决。因此交涉延＊</p>
<p>宕。以至於今。蓋英埃間爭執之焦點。在英政府爲自身利害計。以爲讓無可讓＊</p>
<p>萬不能放棄者。而在埃人爲完全獨立計。則又以爲萬不能不爭到。此解决之＊</p>
<p>所以難也。</p>
<p>今日對英之民族運動有二。一爲印度尚在爲獨立初步之運動一爲埃及則＊</p>
<p>爲爭獨立最後一步之完成。在表面上觀之埃及運動。僅功虧一簣。較之印度＊</p>
<p>運動之程功遙遠。大有難易之别。然而凡事欲達到最後一步。實爲最難。故埃＊</p>
<p>人之努力。尚未可因此而稍寛也。</p>

<p>（七）蘇州河岸旅行</p>
<p>上海的水道、除了黄浦江以外、其次就要算蘇州河了、沿河有不少的碼頭、蘇常内河一帶來往的旅客、搭小輪船或是航船來上海的、大都在天后宮橋、盆湯弄橋幾個碼頭起岸、每天早上八九點鐘、小輪船還没有開駛的時候、許多老的少的、男的女的、擠滿在碼頭上、不多一刻、汽笛呌了幾聲、氤氲的黑烟也從烟突裏直冒到岸上來、小輪船漸漸的離開河岸、向西駛去、輪船後由拖了大大小小七八隻船、首尾都接連了、很像一條長蛇、蜿延着進行、這是蘇州河裏很普遍的一種景像我們日常看報到湖匪刦小輪的事、就要想起在蘇州河岸所得到的印象、</p>
<p>蘇州河與黄浦江相比、自然差得遠了、黄浦江好像人家的大天井、門户敝達、呌人見了歡喜、蘇州河確不然、好像灶披後的夾弄、不但位局促、連種種的東西也帶着骯髒的樣子、所以黄浦江邊、儘有許多負手散步、遠眺江景的人、蘇州河岸的情况便大大的不同了、在外白渡橋和天后宮橋中間的一段、還有若干地方可以流連、足供欣賞、可是越朝西、就越不相同、到了潭子灣小沙渡一帶、就像出了都市一般、荒凉凄苦的空氣、迷漫了兩岸、尤其是廣肇山莊的一段、人烟稀少、鬼國爲鄰、</p>
<p>河岸兩傍的景像、可以劃作三個不同樣的時期我們若然拿横架河上的橋來做標準、那末外白渡橋以西、天后宮橋以東的一段、好像一個青年人、帶着活潑高興的樣子、兩岸的建築景色、處處流蕗着整齊絢爛的氣槪、天后宮橋和麥根路底舢板廠橋中間的一段、岸邊的情形最爲複雜、最爲熱鬧、河裏的船隻也最多、這種煩勞而毫無休止的情况、好像一個人在中年時期、拚命去解决他的生活問題一般、至於舢板廠橋、是蘇州河兩岸最末了的一頂橋、由此以西、便没有橋了、渡河須用渡船、兩岸的情景愈見得荒凉、好像一個年老的人、生趣也愈見得减少、在潭子灣小沙渡一帶、許多江北人住在小船上、可是這種船永遠不飄在水裏、呌牠离水登陸、靠着岸居住、這種没有生命的船、很可以代表這一段蘇州河岸的槪况、</p>
<p>第一段的蘇州河岸、包括外白渡橋、裏白渡橋四川路橋江西路橋和天后宮橋（河南路橋）外白渡橋的「白」字、恐怕是擺字的傳誤、那地方又有個名稱呌做「頭壩」、幾十年前的蘇州河是怎樣的景况、這兩個字倒也能告訴我們一點、站在橋上、向東望、黄浦江的水、就在脚底下流到蘇州河裏南面便是外灘公園、一只地角、成了兩水交界的圍墻、外白渡橋西名呌「花園橋」、外灘公園果然是很有關係的了、那橋堍下確還有一個專門蒔花的花園、站在橋上可以一覽無餘、其中一所玻璃花房、裏面幽靜異常、靠壁一個自流泉、水從上面流到潭裏、綠影倒映在上面、越顯得室内的幽靜、</p>
<p>從橋上向西望、最近的二白渡橋、二白渡橋的兩岸也很有「閒情逸緻」的點綴、靠河岸的南邊、常有燃燒汽油的遊艇、停留在河面上、船裏面收拾得像醫院裏一樣乾凈、撑船的老大們、也顯露着自尊的樣子、他們除了主人出遊的當兒、隨駕扈從以外、平日便鎭天的在船裏打掃揩擦、因之灰污塵土和他們都絶綠了、在蘇州河裏進出的船隻、有的裝載客人、有的拖帶貨物、十隻船中間終有九隻船是擁腫的、惟有遊艇、身軀瘦削、骨肉亭匀、好像是蘇州河裏的女郎、</p>
<p>白渡橋四川路橋之間、沿岸有禮拜堂醫院、旅社、電影院及花園店　　等、尤其是靠南岸裏白渡橋附近、道路平坦、景物清幽、夕陽將下的時候、江風從東面吹過來、拂在人面上、不亞於江濱散步、四川路橋北堍的郵局、是蘇州河畔唯一的重要建築物、天后宮橋的商整會、也有他相當的地位、天后宮後有改組的時候、裏面有不少的攤販和星相家、瞻神膜拜的人、也很衆多、城隍廟紅廟之外、天后宮也可以算着第三把位置、現在門前冷落、大不如前、這也是和蘇州岸有相互關係的變遷哩、</p>
<p>隔了橋看車輛行人、往來的情形、差不多是蘇州河岸特具的一種景緻、外白渡橋上面有一個鐵架子、交横錯綜、高拱在橋面上、一到夜間電車在橋面上駛過遠遠的望去、車厢裏的燈光、從空隙間透出來、很有趣味、夜裏在蘇州河岸又能望見三家百貨公司的塔尖、高　在半空中、回頭望東邊雖後有高大的東西、然而船上的燈光、反映在水裏、蕩漾而搖曳着、兩岸的空氣、似乎沉寂了許多、可是一輛摩托車、很快的從橋面上駛過、沉寂的空中、又像河水一樣的蕩動了、</p>
<h3 id="c203">三保太監在南洋　ＹＳ <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>（十）三保洞</p>
<p>這次是三保太監第七次的航海了、也就是他往南洋去的最後一次了、那時正是一四三三年的時候、他和着了他二萬多的兵民、乘了數十艘「大眼鷄」往南洋去、</p>
<p>一次、他們這數十艘「大眼鷄」正趁着風平浪靜航行的當兒、不知怎的、徒然地起了一個滔天的大浪、於是風也開始颼颶起來了、這數十艘「大眼鷄」竟搖籃似在汪洋中隨浪漂蕩着、</p>
<p>這時這幾十艘「大眼鷄」裏的兵民、通通都陷於嘔吐中了、他們嘔吐得很利害、氣力自然是一點都没有了、這時、賢能的三保太監也想不出什麽補救的方法來、他們這一羣嘔吐的可憐的兵民、這時只能「聽天由命」地倒臥在搖籃似的「大眼鷄」中了、</p>
<p>不久、浪是漸漸地浩大起來、風也漸漸地利害起來、這時、船的搖動更加利害了、翻山倒海似的搖動却令那一羣嘔吐的兵民更加劇烈的難堪起來、</p>
<p>三保太監在這時竟也嘔吐起來、他是想不出什麽方法來的了、「聽天由命」的念頭、這時也許會在他的腦裏浮現着吧、於是、他除了倒臥着之外、什麽事情在他也好像是毫無痛癢地不理眯了、</p>
<p>風浪一天一天地大了起來、這已是第三天了、還不見浪平靜下來、</p>
<p>第四天的風浪、却更來得凶猛極了、這數十艘「大眼鷄」、本來是跟在一起航行的、但是這時候早已給風浪、爲他們分散了、然而這些倒臥在「大眼鷄」裏的可憐的兵民、還絲毫不知道呢、</p>
<p>五天、三保太監忍受不住這苦了、因此他竟咒詛起來、</p>
<p>「假如還是受這麽大風浪的苦、倒不如死了爽快些呢」他的話剛剛説完、而一陣浩大的巨浪、竟把他這隻孤帆打翻了、於是、害船裏的人們、竟因此完全被淹斃、而船也慢慢地沉到海底裏云、</p>
<p>正當三保太監的船沉了後、第二天風浪竟停了下來、誰知在距離三保太監沉船的地點不遠、便有着一個個小小的荒島呢、</p>
<p>時光像電光一般地閃過、一個月很快便過去了、這時、在那個荒島的偏僻處、竟浮起了一個岩洞、那岩洞、從遠處望去、簡直是一隻翻了的船似的、岩洞上生滿了不少奇異的樹木、那些樹木却好鐵鍊似的、紊亂的垂掛着、這個岩洞呢、據説是三保太監的船、後來不知怎的竟在南方的民間裏、流傳着這一篇三保洞的傳説、</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Anglo-Egyptian Pending Issues <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Today's foreign telegrams state that the delegation led by Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas has arrived in England*</p>
<p>and has been warmly welcomed by the British. The purpose of the Egyptian Prime Minister's visit*</p>
<p>is to negotiate the pending issues between Britain and Egypt. The so-called pending issues are the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty*</p>
<p>left over after Egyptian independence. We sincerely hope that the Anglo-Egyptian dispute, which has been unresolved for years,*</p>
<p>can be completely resolved during this trip.</p>
<p>Egypt's ancient culture is admired by the world, and its people possess a firm and unyielding spirit. Since the independence*</p>
<p>movement began, the sacrifices have been enormous. Although the British government recognized Egypt as an independent country*</p>
<p>after the Great War, abolishing the Egyptian protectorate in 192*</p>
<p>2 and promulgating the Constitution of the Kingdom of Egypt in 1923, it would seem that this could satisfy*</p>
<p>the Egyptians. However, the Egyptians' anti-British movement continued unabated because, although nominally independent,*</p>
<p>they had not actually been able to break free from British protection. When Egypt was allowed to become independent, Britain*</p>
<p>stated that it would retain four rights in Egypt: to station troops within the country, to be responsible for the protection of the lives and property of internal and external people, and to recognize the status of Sudan.*</p>
<p>Therefore, after Sir Lee Stack took office as the first Prime Minister in 1924, he went to Britain to negotiate, but returned*</p>
<p>without any effect. As a result, the Egyptians clashed sharply with the British again. This continued until 1928, when Nahas succeeded in forming a cabinet. The Anglo-Egyptian situation*</p>
<p>became tense again. Fortunately, the British Labour Party returned to power and slightly changed its policy towards Egypt, resulting in the creation of a draft treaty of sixteen articles between Britain and Egypt. The content did make some concessions, but the garrisoning of troops in the Suez Canal, the continuation of the status quo in Sudan, and the preservation of the Consular Court*</p>
<p>did not satisfy the Egyptians' desire for true and complete independence. As a result, the Anglo-Egyptian dispute remained unresolved. Later, although the British*</p>
<p>Labour Party made some further concessions, the Egyptians believed that these were all superficial and did not fundamentally solve the problem. As a result, negotiations dragged on*</p>
<p>until today. The crux of the dispute between Britain and Egypt lies in the British government's belief, for its own interests, that there is nothing more to concede*</p>
<p>and nothing that can be abandoned, while the Egyptians, for the sake of complete independence, believe that they must fight for it. This is why a resolution is so*</p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>Today, there are two national movements against Britain. One is India, which is still in the initial stage of the movement for independence, and the other is Egypt, which*</p>
<p>is striving to complete the final step of its independence. On the surface, Egypt's movement is only one step away from success, which is much easier than India's*</p>
<p>distant path to success. However, it is most difficult to reach the final step in anything. Therefore, the efforts of the Egyptians should not be relaxed.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison Headquarters announced a telegram from Beiping on the 27th: (1) Yan assumed the false position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Beiping on the 25th, appointing Sun Chu as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route and Fu Zuoyi as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route. He also secretly telegraphed Xu Yongchang to mobilize two infantry divisions*</p>
<p>and one regiment each of artillery, engineers, and sappers, deploying them along the Baihe and Beining Roads*</p>
<p>to focus on defending against Feng. (2) It is rumored that Yan has adopted a defensive strategy in his operations against the Feng faction, using Lutai, Tianzhuang, and Hangu as the first line of defense, and Beitang and Tanggu*</p>
<p>as the second line of defense, deploying coastal defense works in Tanggu. The general reserve force is controlled near Junliangcheng. (3) Lu Zhonglin,*</p>
<p>representing Men Zhizhong, returned to Beiping from Liaoning, saying that Yan had actually provided Feng's army with funds*</p>
<p>of 500,000, and Feng's family members are still being detained in Beiping. (4) Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces have different goals. Feng telegraphed Yan for days, requesting 2 million in military expenses,*</p>
<p>saying that the Northwest Army had already followed orders to move east and concentrate in Luoyang. He requested that Yan fulfill*</p>
<p>the previous agreement and issue pay and equipment to facilitate military operations. It is rumored that Yan is experiencing great difficulty meeting the demands of various parties*</p>
<p>for pay and ammunition, and Feng's demands are particularly high. (5) Yan's family members have gone to Beiping. According to general observations, it is said that they are preparing to leave*</p>
<p>for abroad in the event of failure. (6) According to a key figure in Shanxi, the relationship between Yan and Feng is such that Feng and Yan's advances are polite; Feng's advance into Luo*</p>
<p>Yang is a superficial show of urgency; if Yan believes that Feng's advance into Luoyang is sincere,*</p>
<p>he will be mistaken. (7) Yan Xishan jointly purchased a large batch of military supplies,*</p>
<p>which were unloaded in Tanggu by Jing Jing on two days. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) According to news on the road, a company of Shanxi troops is stationed in Lianzhen and Dongguang, and northern Shandong is very peaceful. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>have armed guards on board each time. Britain and the United States had*</p>
<p>originally planned to remove the armed guards from April 1st, but the most*</p>

<p>that the government has notified shipping companies that they can approve the continued provision of soldiers and sailors for a certain*</p>

<p>Indian armed guards for the internal protection of ships. (2) For any guards provided after the end of March,*</p>
<p>their salaries must be fully borne by the company. (3) The entire cost of the plan,*</p>
<p>including the maintenance costs of guards who have not actually served on the ship,*</p>
<p>will be borne by the companies according to their needs. The companies met on March 14 to consider this matter,*</p>
<p>but have not yet responded. Conservative Party member Betdu asked the government whether it is reasonable*</p>
<p>to protect the company while withdrawing the benefits previously given to the company. Labour Party member Gan Weixi also said that the Navy's*</p>
<p>guard must be paid for, which is a new principle. The Navy Minister*</p>

<p>First Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Negotiations for the recovery of sovereignty over the Great Northern Telegraph Company's underwater cable were held*</p>
<p>at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2 PM on the 27th. The Chinese side was represented by Zhuang Zhihuan, Wu Nanru, Nie*</p>
<p>Chuanru, Guo Shishuo, Sha Shuyun, etc. The Great Northern Telegraph Company was represented by Peng Sheng, Svenson, Tyler,*</p>
<p>and others. Zhuang Zhihuan delivered a speech first, stating that the various contracts for the underwater cable between our country and the Great Northern Telegraph Company*</p>
<p>are about to expire and have been notified of their termination. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the closing matters. In recent years,*</p>
<p>the world's communication methods, the state of China's telecommunications, and political*</p>
<p>and commercial matters have all changed. In order to comply with the party and national program*</p>
<p>and the teachings of the Premier, we should uphold the spirit of independence and seek*</p>
<p>freedom of communication in international affairs. China and the company have a long-standing friendship, and we hope that, within the scope of respecting China's sovereignty,*</p>
<p>we can provide full assistance to achieve a satisfactory result in the shortest possible time. Peng Sheng, representing the Great Northern Telegraph Company, replied that he was very grateful for Director Zhuang's speech.*</p>
<p>The company has been operating telegrams in China for sixty years*</p>
<p>and has overcome many difficulties. Thanks to the sincere cooperation of all parties, we have achieved*</p>
<p>this result. We hope to work together harmoniously at this meeting to achieve a satisfactory outcome. The parties then exchanged views, and our side briefly stated*</p>
<p>the main reasons and objectives for the negotiations. The company representatives*</p>
<p>said that they would telegraph the points raised to the company's headquarters in their home country, consider*</p>
<p>them, and continue the discussions after receiving a reply.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously telegraphed*</p>
<p>the Ministry of Communications, wishing to hold a joint meeting with the Great Eastern Telegraph Company. Now, the Ministry of Communications believes that some of the matters under discussion*</p>
<p>concern both companies, while others concern only one company. If matters related to the Great Eastern arise in the future, joint*</p>
<p>meetings will be held. If the matter is of a separate nature, it will be discussed with the Great Northern Telegraph Company separately*</p>
<p>to avoid confusion. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to actively promote the cable negotiations, the Ministry of Communications has now scheduled meetings with the Pacific Company every Monday,*</p>

Currently, the 18th year is coming to an end, and supplementary budget plans for the 16th and 17th years are still being sent. If this continues to be delayed, it will be difficult to conclude on schedule, which will cause difficulties in the review of the 19th year budget in the Central Political Council. A petition has been submitted to the National Government, ordering that the 18th year and previous national revenue and expenditure budget be submitted to the Ministry of Finance before April 15, for the Ministry of Finance to be forwarded to the committee for review before April 30, so that all can be concluded and transferred before May 31, so that the 19th year budget can be established in time without delay. The government has now approved the petition, ordering the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Ministry of Finance, ordering all organs to comply with it. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Seeking a Compromise Method for Group Discussions</p>
<p>Disputes Arise Within the Japanese Government Over the Reply to the Instructions</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - Briand met with Henderson this morning and reportedly expressed the French view that a Mediterranean mutual guarantee pact would be most likely to lead France and other countries to reduce their navies. According to a high-ranking source, the positions of the British and American delegations have not changed. The current work of the naval conference is to find a compromise between a purely consultative pact and a pact containing military guarantees. The current discussion is based on negotiating pacts within pacts, i.e., one pact purely related to the Mediterranean, signed by Britain, France, and Italy, and a larger, more general pact that all five powers could sign.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 26th - Today, after Foreign Minister Briand's return to London, political attention once again focused on the five-power talks. Although many believe that the atmosphere of the naval conference has improved significantly since the United States announced its willingness to conclude a consultative security pact, many still doubt its effectiveness in resolving the situation due to the ambiguity of the American wording. Moreover, if Italy cannot abandon its demand for equality with France, then a five-power pact will ultimately be impossible to establish. Therefore, French newspapers mostly state that if Briand returns empty-handed again, the French must realize that the path to maintaining peace through reduced armaments has not yet made any real progress.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - British Prime Minister MacDonald will chair a meeting of naval conference representatives tomorrow afternoon to discuss recent developments. This meeting is crucial. US Secretary of State Stimson had a lengthy conversation with the British representative in the House of Commons this afternoon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th - The Cabinet originally scheduled a special meeting today to decide on Japan's reply to the proposals made by the US representatives at the London Naval Conference, but domestic political resistance has already emerged, making it necessary to delay slightly. The Cabinet's special meeting has therefore been postponed today. It is reported that the Naval Staff is strongly opposed to accepting the American proposals, so Japan's reply may not be decided within this week.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication, Tokyo, 27th - Although today is a holiday, the Navy Ministry held a secret important meeting at the Foreign Minister's residence in Kasumigaseki at 10:00 AM. All heads of the arms reduction departments attended to discuss the reply to Ambassador Wakatsuki's instructions. They generally believed that Japanese public opinion, both above and below, unanimously advocated maintaining absolute 70%, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' attitude was inclined to make concessions and compromise with the United States, which was regrettable. They immediately resolved (1) to maintain absolute 70% for large cruisers, (2) to absolutely maintain the existing strength of submarines, and (3) to demand the inclusion of these two items in a comprehensive 70%, etc., as the minimum demands of Japan. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM. Earlier, Vice Minister Yamanashi visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi at his official residence at 2:30 PM to convey the final decision of the Navy and request understanding.</p>

British Foreign Secretary Henderson, along with officials from the Foreign Office and the Egyptian Embassy, welcomed them at the station. Egyptian students traveled in separate cars, waving Egyptian flags with slogans of the Egyptian National Party written on them, parading through the city, causing traffic congestion. After arriving at the station, they waved flags and cheered. French Foreign Minister Briand arrived in the same car, but those welcoming the French Foreign Minister could hardly get close. Many police officers struggled to escort the Egyptian delegation out of the crowd. The Egyptian representatives are here to negotiate outstanding issues between England and Egypt.</p>

<p>Establishment of Grain Reserves Finally Passed</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 26th - Today, the Tardieu government was again beset in the Chamber of Deputies. The Radical Socialist Party proposed allocating 2 million francs to establish grain reserves to ensure the supply of the army in the event of unexpected incidents.

<p>Reuters, Paris, 26th - French Prime Minister Tardieu stated in the Senate today during a debate on the army budget that the world regards France as first in land arms reduction. Another spokesman stated that the current number of soldiers in the French army is 44% lower than before the war, but the army budget has increased more, due to the general rise in prices and the reduction of military service years, as well as special expenses.</p>

<p>Financial Plan Will Be the Spark</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The storm in Congress regarding the consolidation of the financial plan is temporarily dormant before the Cabinet meeting tomorrow. The various factions in the current government are discussing ways to break the deadlock. If there is no good strategy in the future, the Cabinet may be overthrown. According to the financial plan, the reorganization of the unemployment insurance system is currently the most difficult, as both the Socialist Party and industrialists insist on not yielding. (Another dispatch) Leaders of various parties in the government have not yet reached a consensus basis on the consolidation of the financial plan. The political storm has become perilous again. Although discussions have been held daily recently, there have been no concrete results. The two most difficult issues are increasing unemployment insurance fees and the national demand for reducing industrial taxes by at least seven or eight million marks.</p>

<p>Four Demands Rejected by Congress</p>
<p>Reuters, Warsaw, 26th - Former dictator General Pilsudski is now interfering in Polish politics again.

(2) Members of Congress must not interfere in the budget. (3) Repeal the legislation prohibiting the government from borrowing debts without the consent of Congress. (4) Congress must not convene for at least six months. The leaders of various parties rejected these conditions, and Zymanski abandoned his plan to form a cabinet. Now General Pilsudski's brother, Yan, has come forward to form a cabinet.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 26th - The Spanish king has appointed the royal relative Don Carlos as the commander-in-chief of the Catalan province. It is generally believed that this move is intended to ease Catalan public sentiment, as the previous Bari la was too strict, causing public resentment. Prime Minister Berenguer has vehemently denied rumors of an impending political upheaval and promised that Republicans will convene four major meetings in the capital Madrid on April 1 to demonstrate that the situation has returned to normal.</p>

<p>In Addition to Chinese and Japanese Immigrants</p>
<p>Filipinos Will Also Be Involved</p>
<p>Associated Press, San Francisco, 26th - California State Inspector General Weibel and others announced today that they will travel to Washington next week to promote the Weill's proposal to exclude Filipinos. Weill told reporters that the United States has reached a time when it cannot take care of itself and should now find ways to protect the interests of the descendants of the American people. In the past, only the exclusion of Chinese and Japanese was the main concern of the western coastal states. The trend of excluding Filipinos originated from the recent conflict between Filipinos and Americans in California. Some say that Chinese and Japanese immigrants, under the current American legal system, have no possibility of doing evil, while Filipinos, because they are under American protection, are difficult to control.</p>

<p>Strictly Check Mail</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 26th - The Post Office today suspended the sending of mail to participants of the labor conference being held here in order to curb the activities of the Communist Party in the Philippines. The mail of 20 people who have been identified as communists will be confiscated. These people are under strict surveillance by the police. It is said that there is a lawsuit to request the restoration of the right to correspond. The Post Office has proved in the confiscated letters that several people suspected of being communists are directly related to Moscow and that Moscow is now remitting funds to a certain member of the Philippine legislature to be used for propaganda costs. The Philippine Governor, due to the Communist Party's plot to overthrow the Philippine government, is now meticulously planning everything, but so far there has been no announcement about this matter.</p>

Other members of Congress have also raised similar questions and requested that Congress organize an investigation team to conduct an on-site investigation in the Congo. Finally, Prime Minister Jaspar agreed that the government would send personnel to investigate the labor situation there and asked Congress to await the results.</p>

<p>Disguised Parade Route Suddenly Changed</p>
<p>Crowd Falls Off Cliff, Suffering Numerous Casualties</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Japanese League News Agency) - Yesterday was the final day of the Tokyo Restoration Festival. The weather was excellent, and an estimated two million citizens took to the streets to watch the festivities. However, at the height of the celebrations, a tragic incident occurred, resulting in 36 casualties. In the afternoon, Ueno Park and the surrounding streets were packed with people, leaving hardly any room to stand. At 5:30 PM, a disguised parade arrived, and the crowd surged forward to get a better view, causing a massive crush. As the parade entered the park gate, it suddenly changed its planned route and proceeded along a new path. This caused the already excited crowd to rush forward, and the surging mass of people pushed over a wooden shed located on the edge of a cliff on the right side of the park. Many people fell off the cliff, causing great chaos. The Ueno Police Station received the news and dispatched all available officers to the scene to provide assistance. Thirty-six injured individuals were taken to hospitals. Among them, an elderly woman of 77 years old died shortly after due to excessive bleeding. Many others sustained serious injuries.</p>

<p>Chicago, 26th (Associated Press) - The heavy snowfall that has hit the Midwestern United States in the past two days is unprecedented in recorded history. As of this morning, the snow depth has reached 19 inches and is still falling. The entire region has been transformed into a silver world. All transportation in Chicago, except for two routes, has been cut off. Even those two routes are subject to intermittent disruptions, making it impossible to travel on schedule. The authorities have hired over 20,000 workers to clear the accumulated snow, but their efforts are futile as the snow continues to fall as quickly as it is cleared. Many cars are half-buried in the snow.</p>

<p>The 82nd regular meeting of the Central Executive Committee was held this morning (27th) at 8:00 AM. The attendees were Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Yu Youren, Chen Guofu, and Sun Ke. Those present were Liu Jiwen, Chen Zhaoying, Gu Yingfen, Wang Chonghui, Yu Jing Tang, Wang Zhengting, Li Wenfan, Shao Yuanchong, Jiao Yitang, Liu Luyin, Ke Xing'e, Chen Yaoyuan, He Yingqin, and Enhe Batu. The meeting was chaired by Tan Yankai. The resolutions passed were as follows: (1) Approved the procedures for handling requests from party members for financial assistance for further education. (2) Regarding film censorship, it was decided to forward the matter to the Political Council to be drafted into law by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the government. (3) Resolved to remove Cui Tingxian from the position of the Tianjin Special Municipality Party Affairs Reorganization Committee. (4) Fifteen cases of disciplinary action against party members, submitted by the Central Supervisory Committee, were resolved to be handled accordingly. Six individuals were permanently expelled from the party: Wang Chengen (Jiangsu), Zhang Shumei (Jiangsu), Liu Huajin (Jiangsu), Jiang Yu (Wenling, Zhejiang), Li Zihong (Guangdong), and Zhang Pengnian (Xinyu, Jiangxi). Nine individuals were expelled from the party: Chen Wengyun (Huaining, Anhui), Gui Changqing (Anhui), Gao Dacheng (Wuxi, Jiangsu), Shi Renfeng (Jiangxi), Wu Juncai (Longxi, Fujian), Lei Shun (Honolulu), Tan Kangshu (Honolulu), Xiao Yuansheng (Honolulu), and Yang Bingchao (Honolulu).

<h3 id="e71">Ministry of Propaganda Hosts Press Conference <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 27th, the Central Propaganda Department held a press conference in the Central Second Conference Hall. Liu Luyin attended and reported on the Central Committee's assessment of Yan Xishan, stating that Yan Xishan's rebellious actions were becoming increasingly apparent. He had released Feng (Yuxiang) to send troops to Luoyang and ordered Sun Chu, Fu Zuoyi, and others to send troops from Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin). However, the elite troops of the Northwest Army had suffered heavy losses during the two Central Committee punitive expeditions and could be disregarded. The current center of resistance was undoubtedly Yan Xishan. However, observing his repeated telegrams, he had no firm position. Therefore, his repeated suggestions were altered after being rejected by the Central Committee, which was not as consistent as Feng Yuxiang, who consistently relied on Soviet Russia and focused on his personal territory. Finally, Yan telegraphed the Central Committee, saying that Mr. Chiang (Kai-shek)'s resignation could be cancelled, but his own resignation could not be cancelled. However, the next day, a telegram from his subordinates urging him to stay appeared, and Yan never mentioned his resignation again. It was clear that his own position had already been defeated, and there was no need for the Central Committee to pay much attention to it and launch a large-scale attack. Therefore, it could be said that Yan Xishan did not qualify as a rebel. In the past, the Central Committee had repeatedly been lenient towards such people, hoping that they would come to their senses. Now that things had reached this point, the Central Committee could only impose strict legal sanctions without any leniency. As for Mr. Chiang's recent tour, it was mainly because he was very filial and had long wanted to return to his hometown to care for his mother in Fenghua, Zhejiang Province, and to inspect the garrison troops in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Outside parties had made many speculations, such as meeting with Mr. Wang Jingwei in Shanghai or at sea in Ningbo. All these speculations were unfounded and not credible. Furthermore, the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement seemed to have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, but it had not yet been formally discussed. If there were any infringements on national sovereignty or inappropriate aspects, the Central Committee would provide the ultimate remedy. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Sun Dianying's Troops Completely Resolved <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Han and Chen's Armies Join Forces to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>The Remnants of Sun's Army Flee South</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Sun Dianying's troops, stationed in eastern Henan and northern Anhui, were in violation of orders to redeploy and disrupted the Longhai Railway. From the 19th to the 25th, Han Fuqu and Liu Zhi dispatched troops from the west and east to suppress them. After repeated fierce battles, those near the Longhai Railway were completely eliminated, and the remnants fled south. Central Government troops were also dispatched to pursue them. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Prior Preparations: After Sun Dianying's troops were transferred to the border between Henan and Anhui provinces, the Central Government recently ordered them to move to Hebei province. However, Sun delayed and refused to depart, and deployed defenses in the area of Liuhe, west of Guide, and Mamuji, east of Guide, displaying signs of unusual activity. The Central Government then ordered Han Fuqu and Liu Zhi to dispatch troops to monitor them. Han dispatched the Sun Tongxuan Division and Zhang Deshun Cavalry Division to deploy in the Lfeng and Neihuang areas. Liu dispatched the Chen Jicheng Division of the Third Army to deploy west of Dangshan. The troops stationed in the Haozhou area south of the Longhai Railway were also prevented from escaping to the south by the Central Government troops stationed in Anhui. The arrangements were extremely thorough.</p>
<p>The Encirclement of Guide: After Sun's troops showed unusual activity, they first demolished the stone bridge at Ersangshu, about seven li east of Mamuji, on the 18th, to prevent the Third Division from advancing westward. They then focused their efforts on dealing with Han's troops in Lfeng. Han's troops, having completed their preparations, began suppressing the area on the 19th, launching the offensive eastward. There was a fierce battle in the Liuhe area. Sun's troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in large numbers. Han's troops then repaired the destroyed bridges west of Guide, and marched across the bridge. Since the place was mostly dry bridges with no water under the bridges, they did not pose much of an obstacle to the troops' advance. On the 21st, they surrounded Sun's troops inside the city of Guide. Guide City is about fifteen li south of the train station, the location of which is Zhuji, which is commonly known as Guide Railway Station. Sun Dianying's headquarters had already been moved to Guide, but he himself had already escaped. At this point, Han Fuqu also personally went to Liuhe to supervise the troops, and sent a telegram to Chen Jicheng to send troops to assist in the attack on Guide. Chen was fighting in Mamuji and was unable to dispatch troops immediately. Han's troops besieged Guide until the 24th, when Guide fell. Han is currently in Guide handling the aftermath.</p>
<p>The Battle of Mamuji: Sun's troops stationed in Mamuji were the Zhang Shenjiu Brigade of the First Army. Chen Jicheng's Division advanced towards Mamuji from Dangshan via Tiji, Liudi and Quan on the 21st. Zhang's Brigade resisted stubbornly. Chen personally went to Liudi to command. Zhang's Brigade was surrounded in the Mamuji Walled Village. The village was built of boulders and was quite strong. The First Army then temporarily sent an infantry regiment and a artillery platoon to bomb the area. On the 23rd, Chen's Division used heavy artillery to break through the village, and Zhang's Brigade escaped from the west gate. Chen's Division had only surrounded the northeast and south gates, and had secretly laid an ambush outside the west gate. Zhang's Brigade was ambushed as they fled, and many were captured. However, during the bombing of the village and the attack by government troops, Cao Liyong, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of the 18th Regiment, was killed by a bullet, and Hua Runnong, the battalion commander of the First Battalion of the 16th Regiment, was wounded. Cao's body was transported to Xuzhou on the 24th, and Commander Hua was seriously injured and died after receiving medical treatment in Xuzhou. After Mamuji was taken, Chen Jicheng came to Xuzhou on the 25th to meet with Commander-in-Chief Liu to report, and then returned to Mamuji to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Restoration of the Railway Line: Sun's troops had destroyed a stone bridge in Mamuji. Chen Jicheng transferred the Yungui armored train to carry road workers west, and the bridge was repaired on the 22nd. West of Mamuji, Sun's troops had destroyed two more railway bridges, and the railway authorities had also sent personnel to repair them. The Great Wall armored train was also dispatched west to patrol and repair the road. Two or three bridges west of Guide were destroyed by Sun's troops, and the Bian railway authorities also sent workers to repair them. The railway authorities said that the bridges were not very long, about 30 meters long, and there was no water under the bridges, so construction was easy, and they would be completely repaired in a day or two. The Longhai Railway, which had been closed since the 19th, was expected to resume operation on the 26th or 27th. As for Sun's remnants and those south of the Longhai Railway, they fled south from the Luyi and Zhecheng areas, and were surrounded by troops stationed in northern Anhui and intercepted by troops stationed in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. It will soon be announced that they have been wiped out. The Second Air Squadron has been sending planes west to scout the area for days, reporting that Sun's troops were fleeing in a very scattered and desperate manner. (26th)</p>

<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The local security here was previously under the responsibility of the 11th Division, as ordered by Liu Zhi, the commander-in-chief of the Second Route Army. Recently, Commander-in-Chief Chiang (Kai-shek) stated that the situation in Bengbu was extremely important in the rear area, and that martial law should be implemented during this military period. He appointed Chen Cheng, the commander of the 11th Division, as the martial law commander of Bengbu. After receiving the order, Chen came to Bengbu to organize the martial law headquarters, establishing three sections: staff, adjutant, and military law. The section chiefs of the staff, adjutant, and military law sections of the 11th Division concurrently served as the heads of the corresponding sections in the headquarters. The headquarters was located in the 11th Division headquarters in the Huadong Apartment. The joint military-police inspection office was merged into the martial law headquarters, and Huo Kuizhang, the commander of the 64th Regiment of the 32nd Brigade under Chen Cheng's command, was appointed as the chief of the inspection office. The inspection office was still jointly organized by the military and police and was located in the General Chamber of Commerce. A patrol team was also established, dividing the city into three districts and assigning patrols to each district. Military and police officers from the inspection office inspected travelers arriving and departing from the train station, riverboat wharf, and bus station every day. Chen Cheng assumed the position of martial law commander on the 25th and issued the following announcement: "I have received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, which reads: 'Chen Cheng, the commander of the 11th Division, is hereby appointed as the martial law commander of Bengbu. Martial law is to be implemented immediately, and the local government is to be consulted on conducting a census and obtaining joint guarantees. The appointment certificate and seal will be issued separately. You are to comply diligently and report accordingly.' I have received the telegram and assumed office today, commencing martial law. In addition to reporting and distributing this announcement, this announcement is hereby issued for general awareness." (March 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Zhang Guangwu, Assassin of Wu Luzhen <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison by the Shandong High Court</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wu Luzhen, a pioneer of the revolution, was assassinated by Zhang Guangwu, the battalion commander of the guard company under Yuan Shikai's command, in the year of the Xinhai Revolution. It was not until the success of the revolution, in the 18th year, when the Shandong Provincial Government was in Tai'an, that Zhang was arrested after being reported. After repeated trials by the Shandong High Court, Judge Ouyang Xu, Liu Dexun, and Wang Mianshan announced the verdict in court yesterday. Zhang Guangwu was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment for anti-revolutionary conspiracy to commit murder, and deprived of his civil rights for fifteen years. The judgment is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"The defendant, Zhang Guangwu, is sentenced as follows after being tried by this court for the crime of anti-revolution:</p>
<p>Principal Sentence: Zhang Guangwu is sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, deprived of his civil rights for fifteen years, for organizing a group and carrying out important tasks with the aim of anti-revolution, and jointly committing murder. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>
<p>Reasons: The case will be explained in three parts below. (1) Evidence of the crime: The defendant has stated that he served in the First Jingji Zhen in Beijing, directly under the Ministry of the Army, first under the control of Tie Liang, and then under the command of Yin Chang. He also rotated to garrison the Beiyuan and guard the Forbidden City and the Imperial Tombs. It can be seen that he was a trusted confidant of the Qing imperial family. Furthermore, the informant, Liu Hanmin, repeatedly testified that he boasted in his hometown about participating in the assassination of Wu. Moreover, the county citizens Men Ti Yun, Liu Yinbin, Wang Jianxun, Huang Yannian, and Xu Yunzhong submitted consistent statements. The county magistrate replied in his report that after extensive investigation, it was confirmed that when Wu Luzhen was assassinated, the defendant returned home from outside and boasted to the public, which was known to all. The judges and prosecutors of the county court reported that the defendant did boast about assassinating Wu in his hometown, and they obtained statements from Zhang Qinsheng and Zhang Ling, who lived in the same village as the defendant, confirming that the defendant boasted about assassinating Wu. The Provincial Party Department 指委會 and the County Party Department 指委會 also stated that the defendant was the main perpetrator of the assassination of Wu, and that many reports at the time had been published. (See the provincial government files.) If there was no such thing, why would all the legal authorities and the majority of the people agree on the same thing? Moreover, the defendant stated that he had no grudges against the informant, Liu Hanmin. In addition, the era of the martyr's assassination was long ago, and the events were extraordinary, so there would be no baseless accusations. Based on this observation, it is sufficient to conclude that the defendant participated in the assassination of Wu. (2) The defendant's defense: There are two pieces of evidence that the defendant claims are proof against the charges. (1) He submitted documents such as awards, certificates, and commissions from various official positions, stating that he had served in the First Division from the 31st year of Guangxu to the 2nd year of the Republic of China for eight or nine years. In the 3rd year of Xuantong, he suffered from numbness in his hands due to the wind in the Western Mausoleums and asked for leave to return home. He was not a guard battalion commander under Yuan Shikai, so how could he have been instigated by Yuan to assassinate Wu? (To be continued)</p>

The Gui army will attack Wuzhou along the Dahe River from Pingnan, taking charge of the central route.

Recently, the military strength of the Sixth and Eighth Route Armies has also been replenished, and the vacancies have been filled. They took the opportunity to clear out the Zhang-Gui army to prevent the war from prolonging and plunging the people into misery. Therefore, the general offensive order was issued on the evening of the 16th.

<p>Accepting the Opinions of the Business Conference</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan Abolishes Military Surtax</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Beining Railway Bureau convened a business conference earlier.</p>
<p>At that time, merchants along the railway line, both inside and outside the pass, unanimously requested Shanhaiguan to change and</p>
<p>correct its tax collection procedures and abolish the military surtax. At that time,</p>
<p>representatives of various chambers of commerce presented four requests to the customs: (1) Simplify the</p>
<p>inspection procedures for goods transported by rail when passing through the customs at the pass. (2) For package goods transported by rail,</p>
<p>some may not be able to declare taxes in time due to the absence of merchant escorts. Please</p>
<p>extend the deadline for penalties. (3) Please reduce the customs duties on direct transport of goods between Yingkou and Tongliao, and between Yingkou and Shenyang. (4) Please exempt the</p>
<p>20% military surtax collected by the Regular Customs. The above four</p>
<p>items were publicly declared by the customs representative, Section Chief Gu Jinsheng,</p>
<p>that the representatives of the Customs Superintendent's Office would accommodate and consider them. After the meeting, the</p>
<p>Office immediately sent a letter to the Beining Railway stating that for commercial goods,</p>
<p>taxes should be strictly inspected and paid at the place of departure. All places passed through, except the</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan, Goubangzi, Jin County, and Yixian bureaus, are generally exempt from</p>
<p>inspection to facilitate commercial transportation. As for the second item regarding the transportation of parcels, the</p>
<p>tax collection period is approved to be extended to seven days. Penalties will only be imposed after seven days. Also, for the third item, goods transported by road between Yingkou and Tongliao, and between Yingkou and Shenyang,</p>
<p>the current tax of one yuan per ton</p>
<p>will be reduced to sixty cents. Yesterday, the Beining Railway Bureau also approved a letter from the Customs</p>
<p>Superintendent's Office stating that regarding the fourth</p>
<p>item requested by the chamber of commerce representatives, to exempt the 20% military surtax from the Regular Customs,</p>
<p>it has also been submitted to the Liaoning Provincial Government for approval and will be exempted from April 1 this</p>
<p>year. The losses incurred after the exemption will be addressed by formulating other methods and adjusting</p>
<p>subsidies from the Railway Bureau. The four items requested by the Chamber of Commerce have now been completely and satisfactorily resolved</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Tianzhuangtai Station on the Yingkou branch line of the Beining Railway is rich in products.</p>
<p>In order to compete for transportation, the Railway Bureau reduced the original price of nine</p>
<p>yuan and seven</p>
<p>yuan per ton for the transportation of third, fourth, and fifth class goods between that station and Shenyang last year to three yuan. However, due to the heavy taxes from the Regular Customs,</p>
<p>freight transport did not improve. Also, freight transport between Yingkou and Xinmin has always been</p>
<p>brisk, but for the transportation of general goods by rail, about every twenty tons required</p>
<p>paying more than three hundred yuan in taxes. In order to avoid heavy taxes, merchants</p>
<p>mostly switched to transportation via the Liao River waterway. Therefore, although the Railway Bureau repeatedly reduced freight</p>
<p>rates, it was still unable to reverse the downward trend. Now, the Bureau has sent personnel to investigate</p>
<p>and has obtained the truth. The investigators also went to Yingkou to meet with the</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan Superintendent Hong to discuss relief measures. According to the report of the investigators,</p>
<p>they have obtained Superintendent Hong's permission, but the extent of the reduction</p>
<p>will have to wait for the railway and chamber of commerce to conduct thorough research before it can be submitted to the Liaoning Provincial Government for approval and implementation, so as to</p>
<p>prevent the products of Northeast China from being exported through ports operated by foreigners in order to avoid heavy taxes. The original letter from the Shanhaiguan Superintendent's Office regarding the cessation of the</p>
<p>20% Surtax for Post-Disaster Relief Expenses is recorded below: "According to an investigation of a business conference convened by your bureau in</p>
<p>December of last year, merchants appealed for the exemption of the 20% surtax for post-disaster relief expenses from the Regular Customs in order to alleviate the burden. The</p>
<p>Superintendent submitted a special report to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for approval and</p>
<p>forwarded a copy of the draft letter for your reference. Now, an order has been received stating that the</p>
<p>Superintendent's report on the Beining Railway Business Conference resolution to exempt the</p>
<p>20% surtax for post-disaster relief expenses has been ordered by the Committee to be sent to the Liaoning</p>
<p>Provincial Government for careful deliberation and prompt reply for approval.</p>
<p>Now, according to the report from Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government, an</p>
<p>instruction No. 13 from your Committee has been received stating that according to the report from the Shanhaiguan Superintendent</p>
<p>regarding the Beining Railway Business Conference resolution to exempt the additional 20%</p>
<p>surtax for post-disaster relief expenses, a copy of the review outline should be attached to determine whether this surtax should be approved for exemption.</p>
<p>The Liaoning Provincial Government is ordered to deliberate carefully and reply promptly for approval. This order includes two attached copies, etc.</p>
<p>Therefore, the matter was brought up for discussion at the 95th Provincial Committee meeting. It was unanimously agreed that exempting this surtax</p>
<p>is for the purpose of alleviating the hardship of merchants and facilitating transportation and should be followed. However, there is no guarantee that</p>
<p>tax revenues will be prosperous in the future. If there are losses as a result, other methods of compensation should be considered.</p>
<p>If the Beining Railway can provide appropriate subsidies at that time, difficulties can be avoided. It was decided that the surtax</p>
<p>would be exempted, and the road subsidy method in the future would be submitted together for transfer to the</p>
<p>said railway for notification. The circumstances are hereby reported for your Committee's consideration and</p>
<p>separate instructions for implementation. After investigation, since this case has been decided by the Provincial Committee to be exempted,</p>
<p>and the road subsidy method in the future should be approved as</p>
<p>reported. In addition to instructions and separate orders, an order is hereby issued for immediate</p>
<p>compliance. Based on this, an investigation has been made and the 20% surtax for post-disaster relief expenses from the Regular Customs has been</p>
<p>approved for exemption. It should be implemented from April 1 this</p>
<p>year. In addition to reporting and issuing notices to all bureaus and posting a notice for all merchants to comply with,</p>
<p>a corresponding letter is hereby sent for your reference. To the Beining Railway</p>
<p>Administration."</p>

<p>Eleven Kidnapped Residents of Zhangpu Town Released: Zhangpu Town was recently raided by lake bandits,</p>
<p>and 57 men, women, and children were kidnapped. It is now known that on the 26th,</p>
<p>Tong Meisheng, Zeng Tangshi, Zhu Shouyi, and eleven others were released by the bandits' boats.</p>
<p>Yesterday, they came to Kunshan by car from Suzhou. According to Tong and others, on that day (the</p>
<p>23rd), they were driven onto the boats by the bandits and transported to a certain place to disembark. In an open space,</p>
<p>the bandit leader, about 30 years old, questioned the hostages one by one</p>
<p>before returning them to the boats. There were a total of 18 bandit boats, with ample firearms and</p>
<p>more than 200 people. In addition to the people from Zhangpu, there were also two people from Jiaxing</p>
<p>on the boats. Zhang Bochen, a kidnapped resident of Zhangpu, was shot dead by the bandits and thrown</p>
<p>into the river for disobeying their orders. At about 1:00 AM on the 26th, the bandits arrived near Yangcheng</p>
<p>Lake and ordered Tong and others to disembark and guard until dawn. They met local villagers (the</p>
<p>location was between Chefang and Gaodian) and, after recounting the kidnapping, the villagers there</p>
<p>collected 20 silver dollars and pointed out the way to Suzhou before taking a car to</p>
<p>Kunshan. It is said that the lake bandits were once members of the local defense force in the town last year</p>
<p>and guest residents.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Near Ba City Again Rob a Small Steamboat: In Zhaojiawan, about three miles away from Ba City Town,</p>
<p>more than 20 bandit boats arrived at 4:00 PM on the 25th, with two to three hundred lake bandits, fully equipped with firearms. The villagers, seeing this,</p>
<p>immediately reported to the Public Security Sub-Bureau and the District Office. After receiving the report, Sub-Bureau Chief Wang Zhengben and District Chief</p>
<p>Wang Wuqing immediately joined forces with the county police team and defense force patrols stationed there to</p>
<p>strictly guard the main roads and fire warning shots.</p>
<p>Before long, the bandits came, but seeing the precautions, they immediately retreated to their original position.</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM, the Yongji steamboat of the Tongli Company, which runs between Shanghai and Changshu,</p>
<p>towing two company boats, passed through the area and was stopped from proceeding by the bandits.</p>
<p>The bandits immediately jumped onto the steamboat and first moved 30 pieces of factory cloth</p>
<p>on the steamboat to the bandit boats. Then, they searched the passengers' luggage and money,</p>
<p>including four leather suitcases belonging to someone from Changshu who was transporting them to Shanghai, which were also robbed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, no one was injured. After an hour, they crossed the boat and sailed into Yangcheng Lake</p>
<p>before leaving. After seeing the bandits leave, the steamboat sailed to Ba City and reported to the County Government on the morning of the 26th, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Gamblers Arrested: On the afternoon of the 26th, Zhou Wusan, Chief of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau,</p>
<p>learned that a large number of gamblers were gathering at the Weng residence in Fengchebang in the city. He immediately ordered Inspector Lv Tan to lead a</p>
<p>platoon of police officers to rush to the scene and make arrests. Twenty-four</p>
<p>gamblers, including Xu A'kui, were caught on the spot, along with gambling tools. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. The gamblers all confessed to gambling</p>
<p>without denying it and were immediately fined separately.</p>

<p>Development of Relief Work: Nanhui has charitable organizations such as the Infant Asylum, Women's Training</p>
<p>Institute, and Vagrant Reformatory. However, those in charge in the past mostly went through the motions,</p>
<p>resulting in wasted public funds without any real results. It is heard that the current</p>
<p>County Chief Feng, in order to provide relief to infants, women, and vagrants, has greatly reorganized and expanded</p>
<p>various charitable organizations and added houses for the Vagrant Reformatory. A detailed plan has now been drafted and construction will begin soon.</p>

<p>Preparing for the County Court: It has been recently learned that the preparations for the county court are</p>
<p>actively underway. The opening expenses of the court and the repair costs for the relocation of the County Public Security Bureau to the Puzhao</p>
<p>Temple are estimated to require 5,000 yuan. In addition to convening district chiefs to raise funds, there is still a shortage of 2,000 yuan. In addition to various organizations</p>
<p>holding meetings on their own to discuss raising funds, the County Government specially convened the county</p>
<p>bar association today to discuss funding issues. It is heard that the lawyers are</p>
<p>making unremitting efforts to promote the early establishment of the county court. Therefore, in addition to the original subscription,</p>
<p>they have agreed to continue to subscribe 500 yuan. The approximate amount of the shortfall will have to be borne by</p>
<p>various organizations.</p>
<p>Daughter-in-law Sues Uncle for Rape: Yu Xiaodi, a resident of He Ye Dai in the city, has no</p>
<p>heirs and plans to adopt his cousin A'chang, who lives with him. However, A'chang and his wife often</p>
<p>spoke disrespectfully to Xiaodi and repeatedly quarreled. Yu Xiaodi reported this to the Second District Sub-Station, and</p>
<p>A'chang and his wife were summoned for questioning. It was originally intended to slightly reprimand them so that they could return to harmony. However, the cousin's wife resented the uncle's report</p>
<p>and falsely accused Xiaodi of attempting to rape her without success and falsely reported the arrest, etc.</p>
<p>According to the confession, Field Inspector Tian prepared a document and sent it to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Yu A'chang was sentenced to 15 days of detention for disobeying his uncle. The cousin's wife's false accusation of rape was extremely shameless and she was released in court.</p>

<p>Calls for Rising Rice Prices: The price of rice in Suzhou City has risen</p>
<p>from 14 yuan to 15 yuan per shi. In the past week, it has suddenly risen by another yuan. Poor</p>
<p>common people will have no way to seek a full meal. Seeing this situation, it is feared that it will affect local public order. The Suzhou Rice Industry Workers' Union</p>
<p>specially convened an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 26th and resolved: (1) Request the Yicang</p>
<p>Management Committee to purchase the cheapest foreign rice in Shanghai and open a store to sell it at a fair price. (2) Telegraph various party and government agencies to consider the livelihood of the poor and notify the</p>
<p>union to implement the opening of fair-price rice sales immediately to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou. It is heard that there are still unscrupulous merchants coming to Suzhou to transport rice abroad. In the past week,</p>
<p>more than 30,000 shi have been purchased and transported out of the country in various rural areas. The future of the people's food is</p>
<p>unthinkable.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Rampant in Yangcheng Lake: A large gang of lake bandits, about 400 to 500 people, recently arrived in the Yangcheng Lake area of the county,</p>

<p>was on duty at around 9:00 PM the night before when he saw the young owner of a meat shop in Huangniqiao whispering with a Jiangbei</p>
<p>person. Before long, the Jiangbei person suddenly reported to the beat policeman Wei Jinshan that someone was fighting in a workshop on the south side and asked him to quickly</p>
<p>mediate. Policeman Wei believed it to be true and followed him. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>when he arrived at the Huangbaoche Shop at the junction of Yangming Township, two people suddenly</p>
<p>came forward and grabbed the policeman. The Jiangbei person who was traveling with him also immediately</p>
<p>seized a pistol that Wei was carrying and tied him up with a rope.</p>
<p>He pushed Wei into the river there, hoping to kill him. Fortunately, the rope was not tied tightly, and Wei</p>
<p>struggled to break free and swam ashore. He went to a nearby tailor shop,</p>
<p>took off his wet clothes, and asked the tailor shop owner Shen Erda to report to the</p>
<p>bureau. Upon receiving the report, Branch Chief Zhu immediately sent police officers to</p>
<p>bring Wei back. After questioning him, he sent Patrol Chief Gu Liewu and Xun Gongting to bring Wei</p>
<p>to arrest Liu A'si and Guan Chengfu, Liu Yuzhang, and others.</p>
<p>Xu Yunzhang, the young owner of the meat shop, was summoned to the bureau and sent to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The</p>
<p>more than 20 shops on Nanxin Road jointly submitted a report to the Public Security Bureau,</p>
<p>accusing the Third Branch of retaliating, falsely reporting a drowning,</p>
<p>harming good citizens, and requesting that the policeman Wei Jinshan be thoroughly investigated for falsely reporting the situation. After the case was transferred to the bureau, Zhang, a staff member, opened the court at 5:00 PM to investigate.</p>
<p>Wei Jinshan confessed to the previous situation. When asked, Liu A'si and the other four</p>
<p>did not admit it. Wei was ordered to return home, and Liu and the other four were released on bail pending</p>
<p>investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Taihu Bandit Suppression Army Prepares for Mobilization: Hu Zuyu, the commander-in-chief of the Taihu Bandit Suppression Army,</p>
<p>believes that the bandit suppression troops have already been deployed properly and will mobilize to suppress the bandits soon.</p>
<p>The telephone lines, boats, and other equipment needed must be prepared as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he issued separate orders to the commanders of the east and west regions, Zhao Xiguang and Zhong Yuan,</p>

<p>so that they could mobilize as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Robbery and Murder Case: The Yongren Cocoon Shop in Heshang Bridge, Qingcheng City, in the county, was</p>
<p>robbed last year, resulting in a significant loss. Unexpectedly, on the evening of January 17 this</p>
<p>year, more than 10 bandits suddenly came to Wu Lane in the city and robbed the families of Wu Yuemao, Wu Qiuquan, and Wu Longbo.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Victory Over MacLaines… 50 to 34</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the Guangdong athletes have been practicing diligently, sparing no effort. Last night, the basketball team played a practice match with the American MacLaines team, starting at 9 p.m. at the China Basketball Stadium. As a result, Guangdong won with a score of 50 to 34. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>
<p>(1) MacLaines Used Their Second Team to Play</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the two teams, MacLaines was slightly better in the first half, but the score was 19 points each. In the afternoon, the Guangdong team had a smooth run, and MacLaines had almost no power to resist. The Guangdong team is accustomed to playing four quarters, so last night's game was divided into four quarters. However, MacLaines used their second team to play, which slightly reduced the excitement of the game. Regarding the skills of the two teams, Huang Bingkun, the center of the Guangdong team, was good at both offense and defense, and his free throws were especially accurate. He and left forward Zhu Zucheng were equally outstanding. Li Lianying's defender frustrated the enemy's defense and was quite skilled. It is a pity that Guangdong frequently attacked with long shots, which does not seem like a good combat strategy. MacLaines' defender, Pankins, was quite skilled at long shots and hit them repeatedly. He was not easy to deal with.</p>
<p>(2) MacLaines Opened the Record</p>
<p>After the battle order was issued, both armies attacked and circled several times. MacLaines' left guard, Pankins, raised his hand for a long shot, which actually hit, thus opening the record. However, Zhu Zucheng, the left forward of the Guangdong team, also returned a long shot, leveling the situation. Pankins suddenly made repeated long shots again, hitting them every time, while Guangdong also tried long shots, but they seemed to have bad luck and did not succeed. MacLaines won the first quarter with a score of 11 to 5.</p>
<p>(3) Guangdong Team Showed Their Skills</p>
<p>Seeing that the situation was good, MacLaines changed five players to fight in the second quarter. The skills of offense and defense were not as good as the first five players. The Guangdong team quickly caught up, and their connection was good, and their power gradually showed. They moved forward step by step, reaching a score of 17 to 19. The first half ended at that time. Huang Bingkun scored another goal, making it a tie of 19 to 19.</p>
<p>(4) Guangdong Team Members Worked Hard to Connect</p>
<p>After a short break, MacLaines still used the first five players to participate in the battle. After this, the Guangdong team, in view of the failure of long shots, worked hard on cooperation and connection, and it really rose straight up. Huang Bingkun repeatedly broke through the barrier and went straight in. The third quarter ended, and Guangdong won with a score of 36 to 27.</p>
<p>(5) In the End, Guangdong Won</p>
<p>In the last quarter, the Guangdong team had a smooth run. MacLaines was under the strict surveillance of the Guangdong defenders and could not develop at all, falling into a state of panic. The three forwards of the Guangdong team used excellent connection and accurate shooting to win every section. In the end, the score was 50 to 34.</p>

<p>The Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the National Education Conference, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 25th at the Ministry of Education's conference room. All standing committee members (Vice Ministers, Directors, and Counselors) attended. They discussed matters related to the reception of attendees, such as how to accommodate the members (the Central Hotel is quite far from the Ministry of Railways venue, so arrangements were made with a car company for transportation times and methods, etc.), and other preparatory matters. The preparatory committee had initially drafted a schedule for the reception of members, which was about to be announced. However, after today's meeting, it was decided to postpone setting the schedule temporarily, to be announced ad hoc at the time of the opening, to allow for flexibility. As for the conference agenda, it has been largely set: The opening ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 15th (this day falls on a Tuesday, and key figures from the National Government will be unavailable due to the Executive Yuan meeting in the morning, so the opening ceremony was changed to the afternoon). The general meeting will be held on the morning of the 16th, and the review committee in the afternoon. From the 17th onwards, review committees will meet in the mornings and general meetings in the afternoons. On Sunday (the 20th), there will be a visit to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum at Zaogu Temple in the morning, followed by lunch, and in the afternoon, a tour of the Ming Mausoleum and the Five Continents Park at Houhu Lake, with dinner at Central University. It is reported that after the National Education Conference, the directors of education from various provinces will stay for an extra day or two to hold an educational administrative conference to discuss communication between central and local educational administration. The Minister of Education has already asked the directors and counselors to prepare proposals for the administrative conference, it is said.</p>
<p>Nanjing Electric Dispatch on the 27th: The Ministry of Education has reassigned Zhu Jingnong as the Deputy Speaker of the National Education Conference, and Wu Yanin and Zhong Lingxiu as the secretaries of the venue. The conference venue will be the auditorium of the Ministry of Railways, and all rooms on the third floor of the Central Hotel have been reserved as dormitories for the members. The preparations for the conference are largely complete, and the preparatory committee is scheduled to meet on April 13th.</p>

<p>In order to investigate the status of social education in various provinces and cities across the country, the Ministry of Education has prepared a social education survey form and distributed it to various provinces and cities to be filled out. However, the previous form was relatively complex, and the procedures involved were numerous, making it difficult to fill out at once. Now, the Ministry of Education has reproduced two types of social education statistical survey forms for the 17th year for various provinces and cities, and has issued a notice to the education departments of various provinces and the education bureaus of special municipalities, requiring them to be submitted to the Ministry before the end of May.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Social Affairs Bureau Emergency Measures for High Rice Prices <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Request for Reiteration of the Prohibition on Hoarding and Border Closures</p>
<p>Efforts to Reduce Prices by Two Yuan Within Ten Days</p>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday a limit on the highest price of white rice, not to exceed 20 yuan per stone, it has been found that the price in the northern city was still above 20 yuan yesterday. In the northern and southern city, some rice merchants were even seen informing customers to wait and see how the situation develops before shipping rice to Shanghai. Their intentions are clearly malicious. The Social Affairs Bureau has not yet taken any action as of yesterday, because the announcement had just been issued, and merchants and civilians may not yet be fully aware of it. Moreover, price changes in the market cannot happen overnight. Therefore, the Bureau has ordered the Soy and Rice Industry Association, the Jiagutang Public Association, and rice merchants in the north and south to comply, and has also made the punishment measures clear, so as to avoid punishing without prior warning. At the same time, temporary emergency measures have been submitted to the Mayor for approval. The original report and order are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Report to the Mayor: The report is submitted for review. The rice price in this city has been rising without falling, making it difficult for the people to eat. I have already submitted a request to your Honor to purchase 200,000 bags of foreign rice and to jointly establish a Rice Price Stabilization Committee with local public organizations to handle price stabilization matters for relief. However, on the 26th of this month, the price of special rice in the northern city reached more than 21 yuan per stone. I have observed that the market situation is still continuing to rise. If restrictions are not immediately imposed, I am sincerely afraid that a food panic will occur, affecting local public order. I immediately issued an announcement that the highest price of white rice is temporarily limited to 20 yuan per stone, with corresponding price limits for other varieties. At the same time, I also ordered various rice industry groups to comply, and set a deadline of ten days to find ways to reduce the price by two yuan. If there are any cases of exceeding the deadline, secretly charging premiums, hoarding, or refusing to sell, I will follow the instructions of your Office No. 2560 and No. 2561, and take appropriate action, I humbly submit. I humbly believe that the current rise in rice prices is not entirely due to poor harvests. It is also due to the excessive cold and snow last winter, making it inconvenient to thresh rice. Farmers, seeing the high price of rice, also have the intention of hoarding, preferring to borrow money to pay rent and accumulate grain instead of selling. Rice merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity, and grain hoarding households are colluding to engage in unscrupulous activities, resulting in rice prices rising to more than 21 yuan even before the time when the old crop is exhausted and the new crop is not yet harvested. A low grain price is harmful to farmers, but a high grain price is harmful to the people's food supply. According to the current market price, farmers have already made substantial profits. Rice merchants and grain hoarding households should consider the difficulties of the times and not seek insatiable greed. They must know that hungry people are like tigers. If there is a situation of robbing and seizing food, how can the interests of these merchants and civilians be preserved? Also, considering that Shanghai is a rice sales area, price limits are not a fundamental solution. If only this city limits prices, while the producing areas remain unrestricted, it is not a win-win solution. This Bureau is deliberating on the market situation and considering the food supply of 2.7 million people. I propose that your Honor quickly forward the serious situation of the people's food supply in this city to the Executive Yuan, ordering all provinces and cities to reiterate the strict prohibition of hoarding and border closures. At the same time, I request the Jiangsu Provincial Government to immediately order Changshu and Wuxi counties to limit the highest price of rough rice to 13 yuan per stone (using the Xihu measure as the standard), and to gradually reduce it to 10 yuan per stone within the shortest possible time, with corresponding price reductions for other varieties of rice, so as to benefit the food supply of all people and benefit farmers.</p>
<p>Order to Rice Industry Groups: For the purpose of compliance, it has been found that the price of rice in this city has been rising continuously in recent days. The price of special rice in the northern city has risen to more than 21 yuan per stone in recent days. Such a high price is detrimental to people's livelihood. This Bureau has issued Announcement No. 131, stating that the highest price of white rice is temporarily limited to 20 yuan per stone from this date, with corresponding price limits for other varieties. It is forbidden to exceed the limit, secretly charge premiums, hoard, or refuse to sell. It is hereby ordered that the relevant parties instruct their colleagues to comply. If anyone dares to undermine the price limit, they will be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 35, Item 13 of Chapter 3 of the Police Offenses Punishment Regulations, with a detention of five days for first-time offenders, with no commutation allowed. Those who re-offend or commit the offense three or more times will be given a suspension or closure penalty in accordance with Item 2 of the same article. As for hoarding and refusing to sell, it will be enforced on their behalf in accordance with Article 2, Item 1 of the Administrative Enforcement Law. A preliminary notice will be given, and then staff will be dispatched with the Public Security Bureau to sell the rice hoarded by the household at market prices. If there is resistance, it can be enforced with force. The matter has been approved by the Mayor. In addition to separate letters, it is also ordered that within ten days of receiving this document, appropriate measures be taken to further reduce the current price limit by two yuan until the normal market is restored. Comply with this order without fail.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Concession Area: The Pharmaceutical Industry Went on Strike Again Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Suspension of the Executive Committee's Exercise of Authority</p>
<p>Establishment of a Relief Association for Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>Management Decides to Apply to the Municipal Government for Arbitration</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry resumed work on the 25th after mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs. *</p>
<p>Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that because the management hired detectives *</p>
<p>to arrest [workers] and refused to provide relief, the labor side held a citywide membership meeting at the Pharmaceutical Workers' *</p>
<p>Union yesterday morning at 9:00 am. The Shanghai Special *</p>
<p>Municipality Pharmaceutical Workers' Relief Association for Unemployed Workers was established, the Assistance *</p>
<p>Committee for Unemployed Workers was dissolved, and the Executive Committee's exercise of *</p>
<p>authority was temporarily suspended, with full authority transferred to the Relief Association. The concession area continues *</p>
<p>the strike to the end. After the meeting, the group marched to the Municipal Government *</p>
<p>to petition, requesting the Municipal Government to reject the Pharmaceutical Industry Association's application *</p>
<p>for arbitration and order them not to be stubborn. The section chief of the Second Department received *</p>
<p>them and replied that the case would definitely not disadvantage the labor side, and the result was extremely *</p>
<p>satisfactory. If the management refuses to accept again, further *</p>
<p>measures will be considered. The document submitted by the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to the Municipal Government *</p>
<p>is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submitting [this] as a petition matter: It is noted that the relief issue for unemployed workers in this industry *</p>
<p>has been repeatedly submitted to Party and government organs for review. On March *</p>
<p>7th of this year, relief measures were drafted and submitted to the Citizen Training Committee *</p>
<p>for instructions. The Citizen Training Committee issued Directive No. 2385, *</p>
<p>instructing that negotiations should first be conducted with the Pharmaceutical Industry Association. Later, because the association *</p>
<p>refused to comply with the order, on the 11th of this month, [workers] automatically began implementing relief at the association. * It was unexpected that the management in the concession area would disregard the Party headquarters *</p>
<p>and use the excuse that the government organs had not issued a clear order, hiring a large number of police officers, *</p>
<p>relying on the protection of imperialists, and using force to suppress relieved *</p>
<p>workers, which aroused public anger. On the same day, a resolution was passed at a citywide membership *</p>
<p>meeting that the concession area would unanimously go on strike. The Bureau of Social Affairs convened two *</p>
<p>mediations, but the management was cunning and made excuses to delay. It was not until the third mediation on the 20th of this month *</p>
<p>that representatives were sent to attend, but they were insincere, resulting in no results. The chairman of the committee then *</p>
<p>announced the adjournment of the meeting and scheduled a re-discussion for the 24th. When the deadline arrived, the management *</p>
<p>suddenly evaded again, so the majority of the committee members agreed on a judgment, such as mediation *</p>
<p>No. 400 (omitted). After receiving the instructions from the Bureau of Social Affairs, the affiliated association *</p>
<p>immediately complied with the order. The management changed its strategy of opposing the Party headquarters *</p>
<p>and instead attacked the Bureau of Social Affairs. On the one hand, it oppressed *</p>
<p>the workers who resumed work and the relieved unemployed members of the affiliated association. The Pharmaceutical *</p>
<p>Industry Association hired a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, stationed six at each *</p>
<p>store, refusing to relieve unemployed workers and publishing large advertisements, *</p>
<p>vigorously promoting [their position], making wild statements, slandering superiors, and attempting to confuse *</p>
<p>the public. To achieve their selfish desires, they exhausted every *</p>
<p>possible trick. The various conspiracies are too numerous to recount. It is noted that this *</p>
<p>relief is based on the Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood, which is to accurately investigate the management's *</p>
<p>business development, assess the lack of personnel in each store, maintain the unemployed's *</p>
<p>livelihood, emphasize humanitarianism, and eliminate social ills, in order *</p>
<p>to maintain public order. This was done after repeated consideration by Party and government organs, *</p>
<p>careful observation of the situations of both sides, and then the direction was determined and permission was granted for implementation, which cannot be compared to reckless actions. However, the management did not carefully consider [the situation] and *</p>
<p>dared to openly attack, not only disregarding the law, but also violating public *</p>
<p>opinion, only knowing to enrich themselves, which is extremely wrong. Therefore, the various points presented by the management *</p>
<p>are briefly refuted as follows. According to the management's reasons for non-compliance, the *</p>
<p>first point is that the actual need is not present, and forced relief is being imposed. It is thought that customers often have to wait three or four hours *</p>
<p>to buy [medicine], and there are complaints. Workers feel that the work is busy *</p>
<p>and hate that they do not have enough hands. Therefore, the so-called actual need is not present *</p>
<p>cannot stand. Since [the relief] is based on principle, investigation of facts, and review by Party *</p>
<p>and government organs, how can there be coercion? This should be refuted *</p>
<p>one. Unemployed workers are mostly due to reduced manpower and unwarranted *</p>
<p>dismissals, or the abuse of apprentices who are dismissed after the expiration of their apprenticeship, blaming [them] for *</p>
<p>immature performance. Tracing the source of the crime, the management can easily evade its responsibility, using *</p>
<p>the pretext of social problems, and not knowing the danger they are inviting. This should be refuted *</p>
<p>two. This strike is actually motivated by righteous indignation *</p>
<p>to protect their own position and interests, with the special permission of the Party headquarters. * To say that [the strike] is incited by the unemployed is to blame others *</p>
<p>and not blame themselves, wanting to cover up the entire social scene with one hand, which is too *</p>
<p>unrealistic and exposes their shortcomings. Moreover, the Law on the Handling of Labor Disputes *</p>
<p>only stipulates that strikes or work stoppages are not allowed during the mediation or arbitration period, and there is no explicit provision that strikes are not allowed in all cases when disputes occur. Now, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association wants to *</p>
<p>misrepresent the facts and fabricate charges, and believe that the mediation committee's judgment *</p>
<p>that wages should be paid during the strike period is not appropriate, but [they] do not know that *</p>
<p>Chapter IV, Article 37 allows [the mediation committee] to exercise its authority. This should be refuted *</p>
<p>three. In this case, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened a mediation, but the *</p>
<p>management was absent twice. Although [they] dealt with it perfunctorily the third time, *</p>
<p>[they] were suddenly absent the fourth time, which clearly shows that [they] were insincere. The mediation committee *</p>
<p>made a decision based on the provisions of Chapter III, Section 1, Article 39, *</p>
<p>which is legal. However, the management said that this was a one-sided opinion and made a decision without authorization, unaware of the procedures for handling labor disputes and arbitrarily judging the handling of the mediation committee as inappropriate. This *</p>
<p>should be refuted four. Based on the above four points, the association's application *</p>
<p>for arbitration is completely invalid and should be strictly rejected *</p>
<p>by Your Honor and not accepted. [We] also pray that [Your Honor] orders the association to obey the mediation committee's *</p>
<p>decision and seek a solution as soon as possible. Moreover, most *</p>
<p>of the management are willing to accept, but they are restricted by the authority of one or two manipulators, *</p>
<p>and have to bow their heads and obey orders. The willingness of each store to accept can serve as ironclad proof. Therefore, a special *</p>
<p>report of the entire situation is made, earnestly requesting Your Honor to reject the association's request *</p>
<p>and investigate and deal with the instigators and manipulators, in order to curb the troubles and emphasize *</p>
<p>the people's livelihood, [We] await orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Special *</p>
<p>Municipal Government, Shanghai Special Municipality Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, 19. *</p>
<p>3.  27. There is also an open letter to compatriots and a declaration seeking assistance from all sectors (long, omitted).</p>
<p>It is heard that the management has resolved to apply to the Municipal Government for arbitration in accordance with the law, and decided *</p>
<p>to hold an emergency meeting of all industries at the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association on March 30th to elect representatives to attend the Municipal Government arbitration, *</p>
<p>and convened the executive committee of the association yesterday to prepare.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Conversation with an Official from the Bureau of Social Affairs: The Pharmaceutical Industry's Case of Employing Unemployed Workers <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Other Industries Cannot Use This as an Example</p>
<p>Yesterday, an E-Chen Social Affairs reporter spoke with Director Pan about the pharmaceutical industry's strike and market closure *</p>
<p>, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper. As the case was resolved fairly by the Mediation Committee *</p>
<p>, there are reasonable grounds. To understand the contents, [the reporter] again *</p>
<p>inquired in detail from Mr. Guo Yongxi, the chairman of the Mediation Committee of the case. *</p>
<p>According to [Guo], Director Pan instructed [him] to mediate the case of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union's request *</p>
<p>to hold the management responsible for employing unemployed workers. At first, [Guo] thought that providing relief *</p>
<p>to unemployed workers was a social problem, not an industry or local problem. *</p>
<p>However, China is now suffering from poverty, and the government is also in the same situation. To provide relief *</p>
<p>to the entire unemployment problem, it may be difficult to do so in a short period of time. Therefore, the comrades *</p>
<p>in the Municipal Party Headquarters who were handling this case first investigated the pharmaceutical stores to see if *</p>
<p>there was a need to add people to the work situation, and if there was a *</p>
<p>possibility of adding people in the economic situation, as the basis for handling this case. [Guo] and a comrade *</p>
<p>personally went to Hu Qing Yu Tang, Tong Han Chun, Cai Tong De, and other pharmacies to get medicine, and *</p>
<p>some prescriptions took up to four hours to get. [They] also went to Peng *</p>
<p>Shou Tang, Wang Da Ji, and other pharmacies to get medicine, and some prescriptions took two or three *</p>
<p>hours to get. When [they] asked the workers at the counter, they all said that they were *</p>
<p>too busy. [They] also investigated the business conditions of the pharmacies. According to those familiar with the contents, *</p>
<p>most of the more than 300 pharmacies in Shanghai made money last year, *</p>
<p>only the amount of profit varied. As for the very small pharmacies that *</p>
<p>lost money, it was less than 10 percent. Therefore, it was learned that the pharmacies *</p>
<p>had the possibility of adding people in the economic situation, and there was even more *</p>
<p>of a need to add people in the work situation. Moreover, because the workers were too busy, it was inevitable that they would prescribe the wrong medicine, *</p>
<p>harming the lives of the people. For example, Hu Qing Yu, Ye Tian De, Ren Ren Tang, Han San He, *</p>
<p>and other pharmacies had cases last year where they prescribed the wrong medicine, causing disputes with patients, *</p>
<p>and even lawsuits in court. Therefore, the reason for the decision of this mediation to allow Hu Qing Yu *</p>
<p>and other 53 pharmacies to separately add qualified unemployed workers is *</p>
<p>here. It is in accordance with the central government and the municipal government's intentions that these 53 *</p>
<p>pharmacies (one-sixth of the city) have a need to hire employees and should *</p>
<p>give priority to hiring unemployed workers. If pharmacies *</p>
<p>had no possibility of adding people in the economic situation, and there was no *</p>
<p>need to add people in the work situation, then not only could [the Bureau] not order them to add people, but [the Bureau] could not reject their *</p>
<p>reduction [of staff]. For example, silk factories, cotton weaving factories, cigarette factories, and match factories *</p>
<p>are now successively applying to close down. The Bureau of Social Affairs has not prevented their closure. Each *</p>
<p>of these industries has tens of thousands of unemployed workers, and the Bureau of Social Affairs has not ordered each *</p>
<p>of these industries to separately employ [workers], because these factories not only have no need to add people, *</p>
<p>but also have no possibility of adding people, and when there is no need to add people in the work situation, the Bureau of Social Affairs cannot force them to add people. The reason is that although the work of each industry is busy, it is not related to social security, but the busy work of the pharmaceutical industry is related to *</p>
<p>the lives of the people. Outsiders do not know this and think that the pharmaceutical industry can arrange for unemployed *</p>
<p>workers, and other industries will follow suit. This is because they do not understand the situation, *</p>
<p>resulting in this misunderstanding. Merchants should not worry too much.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Chinese Taxpayers Association Seeks Opinions <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen Points to Deal with the Concession Issue</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, having received a letter from Mr. Fei Tang, consultant of the Public Concession *</p>
<p>Bureau, requesting Chinese groups and individuals to express their opinions for the sake of improvement research, believes that this *</p>
<p>matter is of great importance to the immediate rights of the Chinese in the concession. *</p>
<p>Therefore, it has drafted fourteen points and distributed them to various groups, ordering *</p>
<p>each to express their views in writing for the purpose of collecting and forwarding them. *</p>
<p>The points are recorded below: (1) Should the Public Concession be taken back immediately, *</p>
<p>or should a transitional period be set? (2) Before the Public Concession is taken back, the *</p>
<p>management rights of the concession should be gradually transferred to the Chinese? *</p>
<p>(3) Should the budget, final accounts, and general administrative guidelines of the Bureau of Works *</p>
<p>be approved or recognized by the Chinese taxpayers? (4) The Bureau of *</p>
<p>Works has a total of three Chinese directors and nine foreign directors. Now *</p>
<p>it has been decided to add two more Chinese directors, making a total of five. Is this already *</p>
<p>satisfactory? (5) If it is believed that five Chinese directors are not satisfactory, *</p>
<p>then how many should there be in total, the same as the nine foreign directors, *</p>
<p>or should it be based on the proportion of tax revenue, with the Chinese accounting for 55 percent *</p>
<p>and foreigners accounting for 45 percent, making it eleven seats? *</p>
<p>(6) The Western Taxpayers Association usually holds a meeting once a year *</p>
<p>, gathering and dispersing quickly, with little time for discussion. Can this kind of meeting's power to supervise the Bureau of Works *</p>
<p>be considered great? (7) If it is believed that the above-mentioned Western Taxpayers Association meeting does not have much *</p>
<p>power to supervise the Bureau of Works, then representatives (or councilors) should be elected by Chinese and foreign taxpayers *</p>
<p>to form a standing municipal council to supervise the Bureau of Works? *</p>
<p>(8) All the senior officials of the Bureau of Works are foreigners. Is there sufficient distance between the Chinese and the Bureau of Works? *</p>
<p>(9) Are the official documents, gazettes, and annual reports of the Bureau of Works all in *</p>
<p>English, making it inconvenient for the Chinese? (10) Regarding the above two items, *</p>
<p>if there is distance or inconvenience, then employing Chinese as senior officials in the Bureau of Works *</p>
<p>and using both Chinese and English for official documents, gazettes, and annual reports can eliminate distance or inconvenience? (11) Do the *</p>
<p>public officials in various departments of the Bureau of Works deliberately nitpick and make things difficult when Chinese people request to handle *</p>
<p>matters, demanding bribes? Do [they] take advantage of crises to encroach on or defraud Chinese property? *</p>
<p>If there are facts, can they be recorded? (12) Are the Chinese schools *</p>
<p>of the Bureau of Works too few? Should Chinese schools be run by the Chinese? *</p>
<p>(13) Does the Bureau of Works believe that the hygiene facilities for the Chinese, *</p>
<p>such as hospitals, are too incomplete? (14) Should the household registration in the concession *</p>
<p>be investigated? In addition, if there are other opinions, please indicate them.</p>

<p>director of the Sixth District Branch Corps, and more than twenty others.</p>
<p>Resolutions: The defense measures resolved are as follows: (1) *</p>
<p>Establish Temporary Observation Posts: Public Security Branches in each district, which usually focus *</p>
<p>on the patrol system, should, in this time of tight defense, establish several *</p>
<p>observation posts at important traffic points in the towns and villages where no posts have been established, to maintain order. (2) Inspect Lodgings, *</p>
<p>Teahouses, and Amusement Venues: Each Public Security Branch and Security Corps should send several *</p>
<p>patrol officers to jointly inspect lodgings, teahouses, and *</p>
<p>amusement venues daily to check for bandits and reactionary elements lurking. *</p>
<p>If there are people of unknown origin, they should be taken back to the branch for questioning. If *</p>
<p>necessary, an inspection station may be established to inspect passengers getting on and off ships, trains, and *</p>
<p>cars. (3) Joint Patrols: Each Public Security Branch and Security Corps should send several patrol officers and corps soldiers, formed into patrol *</p>
<p>teams, to set off together, day and night, to patrol the towns and villages in their jurisdiction, *</p>
<p>as well as remote areas. The patrol routes should be temporarily determined by the district director *</p>
<p>and branch director. (4) Assist in Case of Alarm: In case of bandit alarm in each village, the local police corps should immediately join forces to suppress [the bandits] and *</p>
<p>notify neighboring districts to block [them] to prevent escape. If there are many bandits, *</p>
<p>they may request assistance from the stationed water police and anti-smuggling camp soldiers, as well as neighboring police *</p>
<p>corps. At the same time, a telegram should be sent to the county bureau to request that the garrison commander send *</p>
<p>troops to suppress [the bandits]. Those captured by the Public Security Branch should be *</p>
<p>sent to the County Public Security Bureau, and those captured by the district Security Corps should be sent *</p>
<p>to the County Security Corps Office for investigation and reporting. (5) Joint Rendezvous: Patrol police officers of each branch Security Corps should rendezvous with the police *</p>
<p>corps of neighboring districts once every three days, and rendezvous with neighboring counties once every ten days on the fifth day of the month. *</p>
<p>They must exchange rendezvous credentials. (6) Reports: The branch directors and district corps *</p>
<p>directors should report the defense matters handled, and in addition to reporting special incidents at any time, *</p>
<p>they should each report to the county government Public Security Bureau once every five days and attach the exchanged rendezvous credentials. The reporting format will be determined separately. (7) Investigation: The *</p>
<p>district police corps should investigate whether the defense arrangements are appropriate and whether the staff are *</p>
<p>actually implementing them. The director of the County Public Security Bureau should go to each district to conduct strict *</p>
<p>investigations from time to time, provide guidance, and report the investigation results *</p>
<p>to the county magistrate for review. (8) Firearms and Ammunition: The firearms and ammunition of each Public Security Branch are insufficient *</p>
<p>, and the county will request the Songhu Garrison Command and the Civil Affairs Department to allocate *</p>
<p>them to strengthen their strength. (9) Police Salaries: The police salaries of each Public Security Branch are in arrears, and the county government will borrow some money, and the district directors will try their best *</p>
<p>to borrow from the local area. After the discussion, it was 6:00 PM, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Regarding the Collision of the "Gongping" Steamer</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Gongping" steamer was damaged by the Japanese steamer "Daishu Maru" in Zhenjiang last month. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company negotiated with Mitsui &amp; Co., the manager in Shanghai, requesting compensation for the damage. The Japanese company ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send representatives to Japan for negotiations, which the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company refused. Subsequently, Mitsui sent a representative, Mr. Okubo, from Shanghai to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for negotiations. The Japanese representative proposed the following solutions: (1) Each party would be responsible for the damage to their own ship; (2) The Chinese ship would be tried by the Chinese Maritime Court, and the Japanese ship would be tried by the Japanese Maritime Court, and the consular office would be notified. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company rejected the proposal, arguing that since the "Gongping" was hit by the Japanese ship, the responsibility lay with the "Daishu Maru," and the Japanese company should bear full responsibility and be subject to trial by the Chinese Maritime Court. It also stated that the matter should be resolved quickly without delay. This intention has been communicated to Mitsui &amp; Co. in a letter.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Zhao Tieqiao Newly Appointed Manager of Jiyu Company Sues Li Guojie Again <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Did the Plaintiff Have the Intention to Sue?</p>
<p>Raising the Issue of the Subject of the Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Court Believed No Debate Was Necessary</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Should Appear in Court to Provide Evidence</p>
<p>Zhao Tieqiao Dismissed Li Guojie from His Post, Zhaoshangju General *</p>
<p>The mutual lawsuits between Zhao Tieqiao, the Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, and Li Guojie, the manager of Jiyu Company, *</p>
<p>have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, Zhao Tieqiao states that Li was appointed as the manager of Jiyu *</p>
<p>Company by himself. Recently, he suddenly dismissed Li from this position *</p>
<p>and appointed the company's deputy manager, Fu Jucun, to the position, leaving a vacancy for deputy *</p>
<p>manager, which was filled by another staff member, Mr. Li. After the announcement, *</p>
<p>Li Guojie did not comply with the order to hand over the position. Fu then hired a lawyer to sue Li in the Provisional *</p>
<p>Court for refusing to hand over the position.</p>
<p>Raising the Issue of the Subject of the Lawsuit　　Yesterday afternoon *</p>
<p>at two o'clock, Judge Feng Shide specially opened the Tenth Court to summon *</p>
<p>both parties. Neither party appeared in court in person, and each was represented by a lawyer. *</p>
<p>Defendant's lawyer, Li Cishan, stated that plaintiff Fu Jucun had *</p>
<p>expressed to others that he had no intention of suing, thus raising the issue of the subject of the lawsuit. *</p>
<p>Plaintiff's lawyer, Qin Liankui, debated with him. Judge Feng *</p>
<p>believed that on this point, the plaintiff should appear in court to provide evidence, and there was no *</p>
<p>need for further debate. He also ordered the plaintiff's lawyer to state the *</p>
<p>facts of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau and Jiyu Company　　Lawyer Qin *</p>
<p>began by stating that the case was a dispute between the current manager and the former manager. *</p>
<p>The current manager, Fu Jucun, was appointed by Zhao Tieqiao, the Director-General of the China Merchants *</p>
<p>Bureau, who was acting as the special commissioner. As for the name of Jiyu Company, *</p>
<p>it was first discovered in the third year of the Republic of China. At that time, the bureau's *</p>
<p>assets were being mortgaged for foreign debt, so Jiyu Company was established *</p>
<p>to try to remedy the situation. The stamp on the Jiyu stock *</p>
<p>clearly shows the relationship between the company and the China Merchants Bureau, and the *</p>
<p>office staff within the company are also concurrently serving as staff of the China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<p>Letter of Appointment of Jiyu Manager　　Until the *</p>
<p>sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Government, in view of the fact that the China Merchants Bureau was controlled by political *</p>
<p>criminals and corrupt merchants and the bureau's affairs were corrupt, specially appointed commissioners such as Zhang Renjie *</p>
<p>to reorganize it. Thus, the Supervision Office was successively established, and then the *</p>
<p>General Management Office was established. At that time, the former directors of the bureau had been investigated and *</p>
<p>dealt with. Supervisor Wang then appointed Li Guojie to act on behalf of the board of directors *</p>
<p>and also appointed him as the manager of Jiyu Company. Director-General Zhao also appointed *</p>
<p>him. The letter of appointment from Zhao appointing Li as the manager of Jiyu Company was kept *</p>
<p>on file and presented as evidence. The date of appointment was March 13th of the seventeenth *</p>
<p>year. Defendant's lawyer, Li Cishan, immediately stood up and stated that the *</p>
<p>defendant absolutely denied being appointed to act on behalf of the board of directors and as manager, *</p>
<p>both matters.</p>
<p>Who Drafted the Two Sets of Rules?　　Lawyer Qin continued *</p>
<p>that there were also two sets of rules that could prove that Jiyu *</p>
<p>Company was an affiliated organization of the China Merchants Bureau. The rules were drafted in the seventeenth *</p>
<p>year. One was the Provisional Rules of the China Merchants Bureau. Article 14, paragraph 8, and the proviso of Article 1, paragraph 2, of the rules *</p>
<p>contained clear provisions. The other was the Rules of Jiyu Company, which *</p>
<p>stated in Article 2 that the company shall have one manager and one deputy manager, appointed by the *</p>
<p>General Management Office and subject to the supervision and control of the Management Office. *</p>
<p>These rules were drafted by the defendant himself and submitted to the General Management *</p>
<p>Office to be forwarded to the Supervisor for record. Upon hearing this, the defendant's lawyer *</p>
<p>stood up again and stated that the rules were drafted by Zhao. If it was believed that the defendant drafted them, evidence should be presented to prove it.</p>
<p>Jiyu is a Subsidiary of the China Merchants Bureau　　Plaintiff's lawyer *</p>
<p>continued by stating that since the defendant was the manager appointed by the Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, *</p>
<p>which had been proven, then the Director-General naturally had the power to dismiss him. *</p>
<p>The Central Government ordered Minister Wang to supervise the reorganization, and Zhao was acting as the special commissioner. *</p>
<p>Zhao should comply with the order to take over the position. Unexpectedly, the defendant said that he would not hand over the position no matter *</p>
<p>what, or send telegrams, or publish in newspapers, hoping to gain sympathy through words. *</p>
<p>Now, even the rules he drafted and the letter of appointment he accepted were denied. *</p>
<p>However, the plaintiff still had evidence that could prove that Jiyu was indeed an affiliated *</p>
<p>organization of the China Merchants Bureau. That evidence was the defendant's submission to the municipal government to register Jiyu. *</p>
<p>The document clearly stated that the articles of association of Jiyu Company could not be separated from the articles of *</p>
<p>association of the China Merchants Bureau and exist independently. Therefore, the articles of association were actually a supplementary set of articles of association to the China Merchants Bureau. If Jiyu wanted to independently *</p>
<p>draft articles of association, it would require a resolution by all the shareholders of the China Merchants Bureau. From this, it could be known that Jiyu was a subsidiary of the China Merchants Bureau.</p>
<p>The Defendant Lawyer's Indignant Words　　The defendant's lawyer *</p>
<p>interjected and said that the plaintiff and Zhao Tieqiao were not shareholders of the China Merchants Bureau or Jiyu. *</p>
<p>Their actions were no different from seizing the property of merchants and civilians. What about the dignity of the country? *</p>
<p>He spoke with an expression of indignation.</p>
<p>Party and National Laws Should Be Bound　　The plaintiff's lawyer *</p>
<p>then stated that the plaintiff was appointed by Zhao, and Zhao's acting as the reorganization commissioner *</p>
<p>was granted by the Central Government. Those under the Party rule should naturally be bound by all Party *</p>
<p>and national laws. Although Li Guojie had a special *</p>
<p>status, he should still obey the Party and the country. Zhao Tieqiao did not dismiss and replace staff in his *</p>
<p>private capacity, but according to his authority, he could indeed replace them. *</p>
<p>Now, it only needs to be studied whether the company is an affiliated product of the China Merchants Bureau. *</p>
<p>If it is indeed subordinate to the China Merchants Bureau, then it cannot be said to be seizure.</p>
<p>The Proposition of Subsidiary Saving the Main Business　　The investigation of the China Merchants Bureau *</p>
<p>borrowing money from foreign countries and mortgaging its property was not done in the name of the company. *</p>
<p>Its assets and money were stipulated in the articles of association to be handed over to the *</p>
<p>General Management Office. When the government appointed Zhang Renjie and others to reorganize, the defendant *</p>
<p>expressed his opinion in the meeting, also saying that the company was a subsidiary of the China *</p>
<p>Merchants Bureau and advocating that the subsidiary save the main business. Upon hearing this, the defendant's *</p>
<p>lawyer immediately stood up and argued that at that time, the defendant believed that the members of the Cleaning Committee were all fair and honest, so he had this proposition. *</p>
<p>As for Zhao Tieqiao, he was of inferior character, and the government also criticized his *</p>
<p>measures as being unorthodox. If the government were to replace him with someone else, the defendant would still have the intention to discuss it.</p>
<p>If Appointed Before, Can Be Dismissed Later　　The plaintiff's lawyer *</p>
<p>continued by saying that the government's management of the bureau originally intended to reorganize it. *</p>
<p>If the bureau and the company were separated, then the bureau would be in even more danger. *</p>
<p>The superior land properties are all in the hands of the company. If the defendant is allowed to refuse to hand over the position, *</p>
<p>how can it be reorganized? If the defendant's proposition is followed, it will inevitably lead to unimaginable consequences. *</p>
<p>The price of the bureau's stock has already fallen. If the defendant's proposition is followed, the bureau will go bankrupt. Let *</p>
<p>it go bankrupt, and the company will become wealthy. Only the stock, *</p>
<p>the bureau and the company cannot be separated, as has been stated before, and it will inevitably become half useful and half useless. *</p>
<p>Zhao was ordered by the National Government and had no choice but to commission someone to take over the company *</p>
<p>so that it could be reorganized together with the China Merchants Bureau, in order to fulfill the intention of the National Government's commission. *</p>
<p>Since Li was appointed as the manager before, he can be dismissed later, and so on.</p>
<p>The Signature on the Stub of the Letter of Appointment　　The defendant's lawyer *</p>
<p>then requested a postponement, as the response time would be very long and could not be completed today. *</p>
<p>The court granted his request and instructed them to set a date and summon both parties *</p>
<p>to the court for further questioning, and to return the various documents and evidence submitted by the plaintiff *</p>
<p>to the plaintiff's lawyer for safekeeping, ordering them to be numbered and presented for *</p>
<p>verification next time. The defendant's lawyer was still very suspicious about the stub of the letter of appointment *</p>
<p>appointing Li as the manager of Jiyu, and requested to see it from the other party. *</p>
<p>After the plaintiff's lawyer handed it over for inspection, he unexpectedly wanted to examine it again and requested the court *</p>
<p>to keep the evidence on file or sign it as a mark. Judge Feng *</p>
<p>then signed the evidence before stopping.</p>

<p>Yellow Package Car Company Coveted by Thieves</p>
<p>Child Cries, Thief Abducts on Impulse</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Bravely Recovers Child, Captures One Thief</p>
<p>Neighbors Cry "Thief!", End Up Dying a Tragic Death</p>
<p>At 8:50 PM the night before, a dramatic robbery and attempted kidnapping suddenly occurred at the south end of Tangjiawan Small Vegetable *</p>
<p>Market in Ximen, Nanshi. A *</p>
<p>neighbor, Zhang Rutong, was shot and killed, and a thief was captured on the spot by a rickshaw *</p>
<p>puller. The detailed account is recorded below:</p>
<p>Thieves Arrive　　Ren Ruqi, from Funing, Jiangbei, *</p>
<p>is 68 years old and has been running a yellow package car company at No. 1 Dongsheng *</p>
<p>Lane, south of Tangjiawan Small Vegetable Market. He has accumulated some savings, which has made him a target *</p>
<p>for bandits. At 8:50 PM the night before, Ren's family had just finished dinner, and everyone was chatting when suddenly a gang of dramatic thieves *</p>
<p>arrived. Three thieves entered, and the rest kept watch outside, all speaking with a Jiangbei *</p>
<p>accent, each carrying a pistol or Mauser, threatening them to remain silent.</p>
<p>Planning to Kidnap Child　　Ren's family, seeing the situation, all looked at each *</p>
<p>other, listening to them search. The three thieves were about to check the back of the house *</p>
<p>when they saw that the electric light was dim, so they asked the owner for matches. In the light, *</p>
<p>the house was empty. At the same time, people outside were shouting "Thief!" *</p>
<p>The door was wide open because it was not yet late, and the situation had been noticed outside. The thieves knew things were bad and wanted to turn around *</p>
<p>and escape. At that moment, Ren's seven-year-old grandson, named Sanzhangzi, was frightened and cried. *</p>
<p>One thief impulsively grabbed him and held him in his arms, planning to kidnap him and leave.</p>
<p>Neighbor Killed　　Ren opened a yellow package car company, *</p>
<p>so there were many rickshaw pullers at his home. Seeing their young master fall into the hands of the bandits, *</p>
<p>they risked their lives to step forward, snatched the child back, and captured one thief, *</p>
<p>seizing a Mauser pistol No. 710235 and nineteen bullets. *</p>
<p>When there was a lot of noise outside the door, Ren's neighbor across the street, Zhang Rutong (61 years old, also from Funing, making a living selling salted eggs in the *</p>
<p>small vegetable market), suspected it was a fire and rushed out to check. *</p>
<p>When he learned that his neighbor was being robbed, he shouted for help, *</p>
<p>but he was seen by a thief keeping watch at the entrance of Ren's house, who shot him. *</p>
<p>The bullet hit a vital part of his left abdomen, and he immediately fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>Pursuit Everywhere　　When the incident occurred, cries and police whistles *</p>
<p>sounded everywhere. The Third Squad of the Second Troop of the Police Corps nearby *</p>
<p>and the Second District Headquarters all heard the alarm and dispatched police to pursue the bandits. *</p>
<p>The bandits had already fled far away. Wang, the District Chief of the Second District, immediately went to the victim's *</p>
<p>house to inspect the scene, and then took the captured thief to the headquarters, questioning him *</p>
<p>under strict interrogation. According to the thief, his name was Yin Xiachun, from Jiangbei, 27 years old. *</p>
<p>His confession was unusually cunning, so he ordered the victim to identify him clearly. The *</p>
<p>bandit still denied everything. After taking the confession, Director Wang immediately *</p>
<p>telegraphed the Director of the Bureau and detained the bandit.</p>
<p>Examining the Corpse　　Yesterday morning, the Second District Headquarters ordered *</p>
<p>Dong Zhaotang, the chief of the Thirteenth Tu of the Twenty-fifth Bao, to petition the local *</p>
<p>court for an examination. Around 3 PM, Prosecutor Zhu, *</p>
<p>accompanied by Secretary Yu and Forensic Examiner Xuan, arrived at the scene to verify the body. *</p>
<p>It was verified that he had died from a gunshot wound, and his family was ordered to collect the body and prepare it for burial, awaiting the arrest of the murderer. *</p>
<p>The captured thief was also officially sent to the Justice Department of the General Bureau yesterday *</p>
<p>for interrogation. It was also heard that Director Wang of the Second District was planning to petition the Director of the Bureau *</p>
<p>for Zhang Rutong, who had died, to be given a pension in accordance with the precedent of people helping to capture thieves and being killed, in order to encourage bravery.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Supplementary Record of Robbery Case in Songjiatan, West Shanghai <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Over a thousand yuan worth of clothing and jewelry stolen</p>
<p>Pawned clothing reveals clues</p>
<p>The head thief captured in Big Sister Mao's room</p>
<p>Four more people captured, totaling seven robbers</p>
<p>Song Gao's house, a farmer in Songjiatan, Chenjiadu, north of Zhoujiaqiao Creek, West Shanghai, *</p>
<p>was suddenly invaded by eight or nine bandits on the night of the 20th of this month at 11 PM. *</p>
<p>Gold jewelry, cash, and clothing were stolen, totaling approximately over one thousand yuan in losses. *</p>
<p>The robbery and the details of the capture of the robbers are recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Robbery　　Song Gao has a son who recently married a wife, *</p>
<p>just over ten days ago. That night, eight or nine bandits suddenly arrived, first scaling the bamboo fence *</p>
<p>and then prying open the windows, jumping in one after another, each holding a handgun, *</p>
<p>threatening them to remain silent. Two thieves kept watch outside, while the rest rummaged through chests and *</p>
<p>boxes, searching for gold jewelry, clothing, etc. (lasting about two hours), *</p>
<p>packing them into four large bundles, and then they fled with the loot, shouting. The thieves were all wearing *</p>
<p>short clothes and speaking with a Jiangbei accent.</p>
<p>Report　　After being robbed that night, they immediately checked the *</p>
<p>stolen items. The next day, Song Gao opened a list and reported it to the Sixth *</p>
<p>District Police Station, listing the stolen items as one gold bracelet, weighing about one tael, *</p>
<p>one gold ring, four gold buttons, two pairs of gold filigree earrings, *</p>
<p>one gold chain, one clock, one large mirror, four umbrellas, *</p>
<p>two large British woolen hats, two women's leather coats, one women's leather tunic, *</p>
<p>seven bolts of old cloth, over one hundred pieces of men's and women's single-layered and lined clothing, *</p>
<p>one pair of leather shoes, and eighteen yuan in cash, totaling approximately over one thousand yuan in value. *</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, Section Chief Duan immediately ordered the district's detectives to *</p>
<p>quickly pursue and arrest the robbers and recover the stolen goods, and to solve the case quickly.</p>
<p>Investigation　　The squad leader of the district's detective team, Liu Shaoqing, and *</p>
<p>detectives Gan Youxin and Zhu Fengshan, and others, upon receiving the order, immediately *</p>
<p>went to the victim's house to conduct an on-site investigation, and after inquiring in detail about the appearance of the robbers and *</p>
<p>the robbery situation, they immediately began investigating, going to the nearby *</p>
<p>pawnshops to inquire and wait in ambush. At 7 PM on the 21st, *</p>
<p>the detectives were investigating around Robison Road when they suddenly saw *</p>
<p>that in the Houyu Pawnshop, within about an hour, someone had brought a large *</p>
<p>quantity of clothing and pawned it twice in a row, looking flustered and suspicious. *</p>
<p>They secretly followed him and saw him enter the Zhoujiaqiao *</p>
<p>area's public bathhouse. After inquiring nearby, they learned that the man's surname was Zhu. *</p>
<p>They immediately took the victim to the pawnshop to identify the pawned clothing, *</p>
<p>which was confirmed to be the stolen items. This confirmed that the man was indeed one of the robbers.</p>
<p>Solving the Case　　On the 22nd, the detectives disguised themselves and went *</p>
<p>to the Zhoujiaqiao public bathhouse to inquire if Zhu was there, saying that he had *</p>
<p>a friend who was looking for him. The bathhouse attendant said that Zhu was currently in Big Sister Mao's room at the Hong Kong Hotel on *</p>
<p>Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai. The detectives immediately went to the hotel to secretly investigate, *</p>
<p>confirming that Big Sister Mao was indeed living in room 316. They immediately *</p>
<p>coordinated with the French Concession police to send detectives to arrest the bandit Zhu Jun, *</p>
<p>take him back to the French Concession police station for interrogation, and then take him back to the Sixth District for temporary detention.</p>
<p>Further Arrests　　According to bandit Zhu Jun, there were a *</p>
<p>total of seven people who went to commit the robbery, and after providing their names and *</p>
<p>addresses, squad leader Liu Shaoqing, along with detectives Gan Youxin, Zhu Fengshan, *</p>
<p>Dai Qingyuan, Zhong Juxian, and others, went to various locations to arrest *</p>
<p>the bandits Gao Hanqing, Wang Jinbao, Gu Yizhen, and Jiang Haiqing, as well as *</p>
<p>a suspect named Qian Zhaofu, all of whom were taken back to the Sixth District. *</p>
<p>The two handguns had been taken away by the escaped thieves.</p>
<p>Confessions　　The ringleader of the bandits, Zhu Jun, confessed that he was 44 *</p>
<p>years old, from Tongzhou, and lived in the Zhoujiaqiao public bathhouse. That night, *</p>
<p>he and Wang Jinbao and others went to Songjiatan to commit the robbery. He took a handgun and *</p>
<p>kept watch outside. After using the handgun, he gave it to Wang Liansheng at the public bathhouse. *</p>
<p>There were nine bullets. A total of seven people went. After the stolen goods were pawned, *</p>
<p>he used ten yuan, and he was the one who pawned the clothing. In February of this year, *</p>
<p>he had organized a gang of thirteen people to commit a robbery at a certain family on Daxi Road. *</p>
<p>He received three yuan and five cents. Also, on December 27 of last year, *</p>
<p>he, Wang Jinbao, Sun Zhaoquan, and Gu Yizhen robbed Li Adi's house in *</p>
<p>Shenjiazhaizhongshan Road, getting 310 yuan, and each person received 40 yuan. One of the handguns was borrowed from Wu Youcai, which is the truth. *</p>
<p>According to Wang Jinbao, he was 30 years old, *</p>
<p>from Haimen, lived at No. 83 Chenjiadu, and worked as a carpenter. That night, *</p>
<p>Zhu Jun called him to help with the robbery. The next day, *</p>
<p>he was given six yuan. Zhu robbed four large bundles of clothing and immediately sent them to Big Sister Mao at the Zhentai Factory in the west. *</p>
<p>In February of this year, Zhu had asked him to commit a robbery on Daxi Road, and a total of thirteen people went. *</p>
<p>He received three yuan and five cents. Last December 27, he also participated in the Zhongshan *</p>
<p>Road robbery, and a total of seven people went. He received 40 yuan, and Sun Zhaoquan used copper coins wrapped as a *</p>
<p>fake handgun, which is the truth. According to Gu Yizhen, he was 34 years old, *</p>
<p>from the same place, and his statement was roughly the same as before. According to Jiang Haiqing, *</p>
<p>he was 40 years old, from Wuxi, and lived in the southern *</p>
<p>grass fence of the Zhentai Factory in Bangbei. That night, he also participated in the Songjiatan robbery. *</p>
<p>The next day, he was given six yuan, which he said he did not want, which is the truth. According to Gao Hanqing, *</p>
<p>he was 26 years old, lived in Songjiatan, worked as a coppersmith, and the rest of his *</p>
<p>statement was roughly the same. He only received six yuan, which is the truth. According to the suspect *</p>
<p>Qian Zhaofu, he was 32 years old, from Haimen, lived in Chen *</p>
<p>Jiadu, and worked as a carpenter, but the rest of his statement was evasive.</p>
<p>Recovery of Stolen Goods　　The original stolen goods, including gray *</p>
<p>floral satin women's leather jackets and women's cheongsam lined and single-layered clothing, were recovered from the Houyu Pawnshop, *</p>
<p>totaling 35 pieces, and were pawned for 20 yuan and 2 cents. Another leather *</p>
<p>jacket was pawned for 5 yuan and 5 cents, and two pieces of cheongsam leather scraps were pawned for 5 yuan and 5 cents. Another leather jacket was pawned *</p>
<p>for 10 yuan and 1 cent, totaling 40 yuan and 4 *</p>
<p>cents. Section Chief Duan interrogated the thieves and officially *</p>
<p>sent them to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhangpuzhen, in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, *</p>
<p>is the second-largest town in Kunshan County, twelve li away from Kunshan. *</p>
<p>There are hundreds of large and small shops and five or six hundred households in the town, *</p>
<p>protected by a public security branch and water police patrol boats. *</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th of this month, a large gang of lake bandits suddenly arrived by boat, *</p>
<p>each carrying Mausers and rapid-firing guns. They first raided the public security branch, then raided wealthy households and *</p>
<p>shops, robbing them house by house, with no one spared, and the losses were enormous. After the lake bandits *</p>
<p>robbed the town, they also kidnapped over fifty men, women, and children from the town before leaving.</p>

<p>Supposedly Helping Each Other</p>
<p>Actually Scheming to Swindle Money and Squander it</p>
<p>A Pitiful Fourteen-Year-Old Child</p>
<p>Zhu Weixiang is Utterly Heartless</p>
<p>Tang Jinshan, a child from Tongzhou (14 years old), recently brought Zhu *</p>
<p>Weixiang to the Second District Police Station, accusing him of the following: His father, Tang Hongsheng, had been in the *</p>
<p>brick and ash business, hiring Zhu Weixiang (30 years old, from Haimen) as a partner. *</p>
<p>Last autumn, his father suddenly suffered from mental illness, and Zhu took the opportunity to *</p>
<p>have him take out the house deed and receipt and mortgage it for 400 yuan, *</p>
<p>which Zhu squandered. Soon after, he had him take 200 yuan in paper money from the house, still for Zhu to *</p>
<p>squander, falsely claiming that they were forming a brotherhood and burning incense and making vows at the town temple, *</p>
<p>promising to help each other. They even went to the Songshixuan Photo Studio to take a group photo in theatrical costumes (Tang *</p>
<p>Jinshan as Shuangqiang Lu Wenlong, Zhu Weixiang as Yue Yun). *</p>
<p>Later, he realized he had been fooled and sought Zhu, who hid and refused to see him. Only now has he been found, please *</p>
<p>investigate, and so on. The police station, upon hearing that the case involved criminal charges, immediately transferred it to the District *</p>
<p>Court Procuratorate. Upon preliminary examination by Prosecutor Wang, it was *</p>
<p>ruled that Zhu be released on bail, and the case was filed with the Criminal Court for a public trial. *</p>
<p>Tang Jinshan immediately hired lawyer Ye Fikang to file a complaint and request a private prosecution. *</p>
<p>Zhu Weixiang also hired lawyer Zhang Feixiong to submit a defense. *</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Judge Shen Bingrong specially opened the Third Court for interrogation. *</p>
<p>First, Ye Tangshi (i.e., Mao Nv) testified, My father, *</p>
<p>Tang Hongsheng, lives in the Dapuqiao area of ​​Rihui Port. Tang Jinshan *</p>
<p>is my younger brother. My mother died of illness last March, and my father *</p>
<p>suddenly suffered from mental illness last July, sometimes better, sometimes worse. *</p>
<p>Zhu Weixiang was a hired partner. Last year, when my father was ill, *</p>
<p>Zhu Weixiang mortgaged our house deed to Yu Yatou for 400 *</p>
<p>yuan. The official asked, Who is Ye Deming to you? She replied, He is *</p>
<p>my husband. After my father fell ill last year, Zhu joined forces with my husband *</p>
<p>to start a business, so I obtained 1,300 yuan from my aunt *</p>
<p>and gave it to Zhu as capital. Soon, it was all squandered. *</p>
<p>The official asked, Where does your husband live, and why isn't he here? She replied, He lives on *</p>
<p>Jixiang Street. My aunt runs a yarn shop, and my *</p>
<p>husband is out collecting debts and hasn't returned. The official said, Your 1,300 *</p>
<p>yuan is irrelevant to this case. That is another matter. He further asked, *</p>
<p>Do you know about Zhu Weixiang taking 200 yuan from your brother? She replied, No, I *</p>
<p>don't know. The official ordered witness Yu Yatou to appear in court and testify. *</p>
<p>She lives on Xujiahui Road and runs a lime business. He asked, Who contacted you about the house *</p>
<p>deed last year? She replied, Tang Hongsheng, Tang Jinshan, *</p>
<p>Ye Tangshi, and Zhu Weixiang and others. Because I didn't have any money, I *</p>
<p>mortgaged it to my friend Zhou Yuanfa. Zhu *</p>
<p>Weixiang and Mao Nv (i.e., Ye Tangshi) came forward to mortgage it, *</p>
<p>and Tang Hongsheng was listed as the intermediary. He asked, Since the house deed belonged to Tang *</p>
<p>Hongsheng, why was he listed as an intermediary? She replied, Because *</p>
<p>Tang was ill and could not do business, he lent this house deed to his *</p>
<p>daughter and Zhu to mortgage it as capital. This was on July 24 of last *</p>
<p>year. The official then ordered Ye Tangshi to confront her. *</p>
<p>She firmly stated that although the signature was signed, Zhu Weixiang took all 400 yuan. *</p>
<p>When questioned, Yu Yatou said that the money was actually taken by Tang Hongsheng. The official said, You are here today as a witness and must tell the truth. You must tell the truth. *</p>
<p>Now, Tang Jinshan is a child. His mother is dead and his father is ill. How *</p>
<p>pitiful he is. Your *</p>
<p>mortgage has collateral, so there is no fear of losing out. *</p>
<p>Who exactly received the mortgage? After repeated prodding, Yu finally replied, *</p>
<p>I first gave it to Tang Hongsheng, who then gave it to Zhu Weixiang, because *</p>
<p>Tang was the intermediary. The interrogating official also ordered witness Jiang Shunlin to appear in court *</p>
<p>and testify. He was 21 years old, from Haimen, and also worked for Tang Hongsheng. *</p>
<p>On May 21 of last year, because Tang was ill, he transferred it to Ye Deming to run *</p>
<p>independently. On June 16, Ye Deming and Zhu Weixiang partnered to do business. *</p>
<p>I wrote the mortgage document last year. It was borrowed by Ye Mao Nv and Zhu Weixiang. *</p>
<p>However, Ye Deming and Zhu Weixiang usually squandered money like dirt. *</p>
<p>I and the two of them are good friends, but Zhu is slightly more honest than Ye. *</p>
<p>I am telling the truth. Tang Jinshan also testified. He was 14 years old and briefly provided the previous details. *</p>
<p>At this point, lawyer Ye presented a theatrical photo of Zhu Weixiang and Tang Jinshan. *</p>
<p>After the judge examined it, it was returned to the court. The official ordered Zhu Weixiang to appear in court and testify that the loan *</p>
<p>was borrowed by Tang Hongsheng. As for the 200 yuan, it was *</p>
<p>issued for transportation and can be verified by the accounts. The official ordered the accounts to be submitted to the court. *</p>
<p>He also asked what the meaning of taking pictures and making vows was. Zhu stammered in response. *</p>
<p>The judge, understanding the situation, instructed the lawyers of both parties, The debate will not be opened today. *</p>
<p>The hearing will be reconvened later. Zhu Weixiang will remain on his original bail *</p>
<p>awaiting instructions.</p>

<p>are now scheduled to be handed over on May 26 of this year. Therefore, once the Western taxpayer annual meeting is held on April 16,</p>
<p>the furniture and belongings therein will be moved. According to the plans for the construction of the hall, it began in 1888,</p>
<p>but due to the difficulty in raising funds, it was not implemented for a long time. In 1897, it was decided</p>
<p>to build the market and the drill hall, which are the buildings of today's Municipal Council,</p>
<p>and it was completed in 1898. Subsequently, the drill hall was opened, also serving as a</p>
<p>place for public gatherings and holding concerts and dances, and renamed the</p>
<p>Municipal Council. For more than 30 years, it has often been a gathering place for the foreign community. Currently, the attached library</p>
<p>will be moved to the old Carlton Hotel, while the market</p>
<p>will be moved to the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Fuzhou Road, where a three-story</p>

<p>Price Changed to 2.1 Cents Per Unit</p>
<p>To be Implemented Starting March This Year</p>
<p>The Bao Ming Electric Company is small in scale, and its electricity generation costs are relatively high.</p>
<p>Its electricity price was originally set at 2.5 cents per unit. In May of last</p>
<p>year, it was believed that the electricity business must have low prices and be convenient for users</p>
<p>in order to have hope for development. Therefore, starting in June, the price was changed to</p>
<p>2.3 cents per unit. Later, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau revised the business regulations of the various</p>
<p>electric companies in the city, and all original connection fees were</p>
<p>cancelled. The minimum amount of electricity used was further reduced. The company</p>
<p>complied with these changes one by one, and they were implemented starting in January of this year. Due to the above</p>
<p>fee reductions, the company's total revenue decreased by no less than</p>
<p>4,500 yuan for the entire year. Given its business situation, it was quite</p>
<p>difficult to reduce prices further. Recently, due to continuous requests</p>
<p>from users, the company decided to reluctantly reduce the price of electricity for lighting</p>
<p>and electric fans by another 2 cents per unit, starting in July of this year, i.e., to actually charge 2.</p>
<p>1 cents per unit, and reported this to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for record. However, the Bureau believed that the implementation</p>
<p>date was still too late and ordered that it be considered for advancement. It is now known that the</p>
<p>company has complied with the order to advance the implementation to March and has submitted</p>
<p>it for approval on record.</p>

<p>Shop Assistant and Boatman Killed</p>
<p>The Ren Da Long native cloth store dispatched shop assistant Shen Xingxiang and others to set up branches in Chuansha,</p>
<p>Pudong. The day before yesterday, the branch collected more than 600 pieces of cloth.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, they hired the boat of Ding He Shang to transport the goods to Shanghai. In the evening, while sailing in Chenjiaxing,</p>
<p>the Ding boat was suddenly violently struck amidships by a gasoline boat heading out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>The boat was split into two pieces. The shipping assistant Wang Baosheng and Ding He Shang, along with</p>
<p>three other boatmen, all fell into the water. Another boatman named Aqi</p>
<p>is missing. The boat sank. Because it was nighttime, rescue was</p>
<p>difficult. It was not until yesterday morning that Ding hired a boat to report the incident to Shanghai. On the one hand, people were sent to</p>
<p>guard the area. The store hired a boat to salvage the sunken cargo.</p>
<p>Only dozens of bolts of native cloth were salvaged. The remaining goods were swept away by the tide. As for</p>
<p>the shipping assistant Wang Baosheng and the boatman Aqi, their bodies have not yet</p>
<p>been recovered.</p>

<p>Shao Xishi is extremely bored</p>
<p>Qian Gong's Past is Now Wrong</p>
<p>Qian Sanguan's wife, Gong, a villager from Xiaoqiaotou Township near Yangshuyuan, Wuxi,</p>
<p>is 38 years old this year. Her husband passed away seven years ago, leaving</p>
<p>two daughters and one son. The eldest daughter is named Afeng, and is 14 years old this year.</p>
<p>The second daughter, Lingdi, is 11 years old this year. The youngest son is named Lingbao. Her husband</p>
<p>died when she was still pregnant with him, and he is now seven years old. Although the family has a small amount of land,</p>
<p>two to three mu, no one has cultivated it since her husband died, resulting in a lack of support for the four members of the family.</p>
<p>Therefore, the year after her husband's death, Gong became involved with the tailor Shao Xishi.</p>
<p>Since they could not be open about it in the countryside,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>that winter, she took her children to Shanghai under the pretext of working.</p>
<p>She came to Shanghai with her lover and rented a room upstairs at Yinha Li, Minguo Road.</p>
<p>However, Shao's daily wages as a tailor were not enough to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Initially, Gong used the more than one hundred yuan in land rent she had brought from her hometown to Shanghai,</p>
<p>as well as the money she made from selling her clothes and jewelry, to supplement their daily expenses.</p>
<p>Before a year had passed, they were penniless. Shao, unable to maintain the situation, secretly returned to his hometown,</p>
<p>abandoning them in Shanghai. Gong had no choice but to ask</p>
<p>Rong Lu, a fellow villager who worked as a foreman at a yarn factory in Xiaoshadu, to introduce her</p>
<p>to work at the yarn factory. She moved her children to live in the workshop at Caoxiebang, Xiaoshadu.</p>
<p>Soon after, her two daughters also entered the yarn factory to work.</p>
<p>Gong earned more than thirty yuan a month, and in a few years she had saved some money.</p>
<p>Last spring, she returned to her hometown to pay off all the debts</p>
<p>her late husband had owed before his death. She returned to Shanghai to continue working as a female worker. Later, her lover Shao</p>
<p>Xishi discovered that Gong's monthly income was quite high and that she had money in hand. Therefore,</p>
<p>he came to Shanghai a few days ago and went to the workshop in Xiaoshadu, intending to rekindle their old relationship.</p>
<p>However, Gong believed that Shao was ungrateful and had abandoned her when she was in poverty.</p>
<p>She wondered if he still had any conscience and refused to let him stay. Shao harbored resentment in his heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, the next day, while Gong and her daughters were working in the yarn factory,</p>
<p>he lured Lingbao, who was left at home to watch the door, with candy.</p>
<p>He took Lingbao on a tram to the North Railway Station, boarded the</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, and took Lingbao to his hometown in Wuxi to hide him.</p>
<p>After Lingbao disappeared, Gong reported the incident to the police, but there was no trace of him. Later,</p>
<p>she received a letter from Shao Xishi from Wuxi, stating that Lingbao was now in his hometown and that</p>
<p>she would have to pay one hundred yuan to redeem him. After receiving the letter, Gong traveled to Wuxi overnight by</p>
<p>train and reported the incident to the township office, which rescued Lingbao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she brought him back to Shanghai by train, and mother and son were reunited. It can be said that it was fortunate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City Police Bureau issued a notice yesterday to all district stations</p>
<p>stating: "It has been found that the Ministry of Interior previously issued regulations prohibiting the wearing of braids.</p>
<p>The regulations stipulated that all braids must be cut off within three months of the regulations being posted.</p>
<p>Repeated orders have been issued to strictly investigate and encourage people to cut them off.</p>
<p>However, reports have been received that rickshaw pullers and</p>
<p>ignorant people in the city are still wearing braids and parading in the streets.</p>
<p>It is clear that the district chiefs have not been diligently enforcing the regulations. In addition to forwarding the notice,</p>
<p>you are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates to investigate at all times</p>
<p>and to instruct the police stationed near the various tax collection offices of the Finance Bureau</p>
<p>to pay attention. If there are people who are wearing braids, they should be taken to the</p>
<p>district station, informed of the benefits and disadvantages, and encouraged to cut them off. They should be dealt with in accordance with Article 6 of the previously</p>
<p>issued regulations on wearing braids, and the situation of compliance</p>
<p>should be reported at any time. This order."</p>

<p>To meet the needs of passengers on the two lines, the effective period of the first and second class excursion round-trip tickets</p>

<p>in order to solve the problem of passengers getting on and off beyond the station between Fanwangdu and Shanghai North Station,</p>
<p>has issued a special circular stating: "It has been found that passengers holding first and second class excursion round-trip tickets between Fanwangdu and Hangzhou</p>
<p>often board and disembark at Shanghai North Station. For the convenience of passengers, these Fan-Hang excursion</p>
<p>round-trip tickets are permitted to be used to Shanghai North Station, provided that the</p>

<p>Merchants from the Town Jointly Petition for Release</p>
<p>Chen Tianxi (Chen Ziqing), a municipal committee member of Yangsi Township in Pudong,</p>
<p>was kidnapped by bandits. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team purchased information in Dong Sanlintang</p>
<p>and successfully cracked the case, rescuing the hostage. Eight or nine male and female kidnappers were arrested on the spot.</p>
<p>After repeated investigations, the case was clarified, and the Detective Team transferred</p>
<p>all the suspects to the Third Section, submitting a document to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for detention and interrogation.</p>
<p>It is now known that the kidnapper, Hou, confessed to implicating Chen You and a Mr. Wang, who have also been detained for interrogation.</p>
<p>The shops in the town believe that Chen You and Mr. Wang, who were implicated by Hou,</p>
<p>have always been law-abiding merchants. Yesterday, they jointly</p>
<p>submitted a public petition requesting that Mr. Wang be released first to avoid being implicated innocently.</p>

<p>Saying Death Is Not an Insulting Term</p>
<p>Judge Sun Orders Xiang to Appear in Court</p>
<p>The novelist Xiang Kairan (i.e., Bu Xiao Sheng) was previously in litigation with Shihuan Bookstore</p>
<p>over the book "The Head That Flew at Midnight." A judgment was issued the day before yesterday, rejecting Xiang Kairan's claims. Unexpectedly, Xiang recently accused</p>
<p>Dongfang Liang and Jiang Xiahun of the Shanghai Popular Bookstore on Simalu of using a criminal</p>
<p>false identity to deceive readers in the Shanghai Provisional Court.</p>
<p>The reason was that Popular Bookstore published a book called "Guo Ji Da Guan" (National Skills Overview)</p>
<p>with the words "Posthumous Works of Bu Xiao Sheng" added to the top. Therefore, Xiang came out to deny it. Yesterday</p>
<p>afternoon, Judge Sun Yuan presided over the court hearing. The defendants, Dongfang Liang and Jiang</p>
<p>Xiahun, hired lawyer Zhang Chongding, who argued that "Guo Ji Da Guan"</p>
<p>contained articles such as "Thirty-Six Rods in the Mother-Son Style" and "The Great Sword King Wu," which were indeed</p>
<p>written by Xiang Kairan and could be proven with his original manuscript in his own handwriting. Moreover, the manuscript fees</p>
<p>had all been paid, and there was also sufficient evidence. As for the term "posthumous works,"</p>
<p>at the time, there was indeed a rumor in Shanghai that Bu Xiao Sheng had died.</p>
<p>Jing Bao and other newspapers had records of this, which proves that this rumor was not spread by the defendants.</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone must die. Buddhists call it Nirvana, and</p>
<p>Taoists call it ascension. These are by no means insulting terms. Now, on behalf of the defendants,</p>
<p>a counterclaim is being filed against Xiang Kairan, accusing him of fraud and libel.</p>
<p>The judge is requested to order Xiang to appear in court in person. Judge Sun Yuan accepted the testimony.</p>
<p>Since Xiang had not arrived today, the hearing was adjourned to the afternoon of April 10.</p>
<p>At that time, Xiang Kairan must be ordered to appear in court in person.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government Port Authority has reached an agreement with various shipping companies to take back the wharves in South Shanghai</p>
<p>and make them public. Starting in late March, the shipping companies leasing the wharves</p>
<p>will pay a deposit of 700,000 yuan, which will be paid to the Port Authority to</p>
<p>reimburse Da Da and others for the construction costs of the various wharves.</p>
<p>The first installment of the deposit, limited to payment to the Bureau by the end of this month,</p>
<p>is currently facing difficulties for the various Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai to raise</p>
<p>this large sum of money due to the impact of the current situation and financial relations. They have jointly sent a letter to the Port Authority requesting a change in arrangements.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has issued an instruction stating, in brief, that "According to the financial pressures reported by various shipping merchants,</p>
<p>the deposit can be changed to one-tenth of the original amount to be paid first. The remainder can be paid at a suitable time</p>
<p>when conditions permit. The Port Authority should convene the various shipping merchants to thoroughly discuss the</p>
<p>methods to ensure that the reorganization proceeds smoothly despite the changes." It also ordered that one-tenth of the deposit, which should be paid, be sent to the Finance Bureau,</p>
<p>and the takeover period should be in the middle of next month. In addition, the Ning-Shao and six other companies requested that the Port Authority retain the fee schedule</p>
<p>for berths at each wharf. The reply stated that this case had been approved by the Municipal Government and could not be deleted or changed.</p>

<p>Husband Ugly, Lover Old</p>
<p>Zhang Haibao, a native of Ningbo, is 22 years old and works as a farmer.</p>
<p>He married a woman named Du, who is 18 years old. She is considered to be quite attractive in appearance. Because</p>
<p>Zhang is both lame and has leprosy, it is quite a lamentable situation of a phoenix following a crow. A month after their marriage,</p>
<p>she came to Shanghai and found work at a yarn factory. She was seduced by Jin Feng, a female worker in the same factory,</p>
<p>and became involved with Fan Zhongxin, a carpenter from the Greater China Hotel.</p>
<p>However, Fan is 39 years old and already has a wife and children at home. Therefore,</p>
<p>he hid Du in the home of the rogue Jiang Sen. Jiang lives at</p>
<p>No. 13 Shunxing Li, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. However,</p>
<p>Du's husband, Zhang Haibao, came to Shanghai</p>

<p>Leading to a Tragic Death</p>
<p>Yin De Kui, a cook in the household of a certain family in Seymour Road, at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, rode</p>
<p>his bicycle to the small vegetable market to buy vegetables. When he passed Jing'an Temple Road, he turned west.</p>
<p>A car with the number 12077 was traveling in the same direction as Yin, but the car was slightly behind.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Yin suddenly turned the wheels of his bicycle and headed north, intending to cross the road,</p>
<p>resulting in a collision with the car that was traveling straight ahead. Yin was seriously injured. A police officer</p>
<p>saw this and sent Yin by car to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He died yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the police ordered an investigation and transported the body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Judge Ge of the Provisional Court came to the office to verify the cause of death.</p>
<p>He sat in the court and heard testimony from Mr. Talim, a British military officer in the car with the number 12077, who stated that</p>
<p>the car was owned by the Taila Motor Company and that the accident was caused by the dead man's bicycle traveling at excessive speed.</p>
<p>Next, the driver of the car, Wang Linfu, explained the circumstances of the collision at the time.</p>
<p>Yin Zengshi, the dead man's wife, tearfully pleaded for justice. Judge Ge reviewed the testimony and ruled that</p>
<p>the car driver was not at fault and was exempt from prosecution. He also instructed Yin Zengshi to sign a statement and take the body for burial.</p>
<p>He instructed the car company to provide a discretionary amount of compensation to settle the case.</p>

<p>They found a man carrying a sack who appeared flustered.</p>

<p>Captain Xu brought the case for preliminary interrogation. According to his confession, he was named Wu Zhenxing, 24 years old, and was from Wuxi.</p>
<p>He said that the items in the sack were entrusted to him by a friend to be taken to a certain place.</p>
<p>Because the matter involved smuggling opium, he was ordered to prepare a document and submit it</p>
<p>to the Third Section of the Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday (March 21) at about 6:00 PM, a person went to the home of Cui Wu, a fellow villager, at No. 4 Lixing Street for something.</p>
<p>Her husband, Cui Boyi, was out pulling a rickshaw and had not yet returned. Suddenly, five or six rogues grabbed him and forced him to write an IOU for 30 yuan.</p>
<p>At the time, Wang Chengrong, the landlord of the second room, came out to mediate and had Guangci pay 8</p>
<p>yuan in advance, which was handed over to Jiang Xingmao, who lived with him, to be given to the rogues. The next morning, Guangci went to Wang's to return the money.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, when Guangci went to the same place, Wang and Jiang again demanded money from him. Guangci, in desperation,</p>
<p>grabbed the two of them and took them to the Second Precinct, Second Division, which had jurisdiction over the area.</p>
<p>After a brief interrogation by the chief of the station, a document was prepared and transferred to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>

<p>Fushan, who claimed to be 13 years old and from Dantu. He said that his home was on Gaozi Street and that he had a mother named Chen Chen.</p>
<p>He came to Shanghai on the 22nd day of the first month of the Lunar New Year through the introduction of his fellow villager Zhu Dequan.</p>
<p>He was an apprentice at the Liu Siwu barber shop. He got lost while playing outside. The boy was wearing</p>
<p>a melon-shaped hat, a black cloth cotton robe, black cloth leggings, woolen socks, and black cloth</p>
<p>shoes. The boy has now been sent to the Women and Children's Relief Association to be cared for while waiting to be claimed.</p>

<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Middle-Aged Mother (to her seventy-year-old father*)—Dad, the children are looking for those two dance records. Have you seen them?</p>
<p>Grandfather—Don't make a sound. I'm having fun with them. I'm sitting on them.</p>
<p>A—It's really strange. He's young. Why did he have to marry an old maid?</p>
<p>B—He collects a lot of antiques at home. Marrying an old maid to match makes it feel even more antique.</p>
<p>Housewife—This is really impossible. I can't sleep at night lately. I'm worried about all these bills.</p>
<p>Debt Collector—I'm the same as you. So I have to collect it today. So I don't stay awake again tonight.</p>
<p>Judge—Do you keep committing crimes for the rest of your life? Don't you want to live freely if you keep going to jail?</p>
<p>Criminal—I won't fall for your tricks again. Once I wanted to regain my freedom. I escaped from prison in the middle of the night. Unexpectedly, they caught me. Instead, they extended my prison term by six months.</p>
<h3 id="e166">A Night's Conversation with Dr. Chu <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Cailiang</p>
<p>At seven o'clock the night before last, the Chinese Students' Association of the World specially invited Dr. Chu Minyi to give a lecture. The topic was "The Purpose and Method of Physical Education." His exposition was thorough and detailed. Unfortunately, I am forgetful and could not record the main points. I will record a few key points from the speech below to share with those who like to listen to Dr. Chu's lectures.</p>
<p>Promote Domestic Products. Most of the sports equipment currently used are imported goods. As a result, the issue of sports has almost become a patent of the bourgeoisie. Nothing is more unfair than this. For the sake of popularization, it is necessary to promote domestic products. I remember when I was in the National Exhibition, I initiated a shuttlecock kicking competition. At that time, many guests came to participate, so the results were quite good. Unfortunately, the exhibition period was short, so it could not be a permanent exhibition. I hope that people with good intentions will promote it more and make more inventions, so that everyone can achieve the goal of exercise. I can't help but look forward to it.</p>
<p>Recognize the Goal. The common problem of our Chinese people is that they like to talk about the surface. Even in terms of sports, it is no exception. Looking at the results of various Far East competitions in recent years, it is lamentable. This kind of effort to embrace the Buddha's feet when the time is urgent has no hope of success. Moreover, the purpose of physical education is health, and it cannot be achieved overnight. It is meaningless to compete for a moment's length. It is necessary to persist and work hard. Then I dare to say that the loss in the east can be recovered in the evening.</p>
<p>Control Exercise. Confucius said, "Only wine has no limit and is not chaotic." We should also view exercise in the same way. As for today's students in various schools who pay attention to exercise, their enthusiasm is commendable. However, I heard that some people specialize in it and neglect their studies, which seems too much. The time is not economical, and it is also harmful to physiology. The so-called benefit is not seen, but the harm comes first, which is really not worth it. (Repaid)</p>
<h3 id="e167">Record of Mr. Guan's Funeral <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Liangyu</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Zhiqing of Wuxi was a pioneer in the business world. He served as the Chinese manager of Siemens for twenty years. He made decisive decisions and spoke clearly. The Germans were usually arrogant, but they were all sincerely convinced by Mr. Guan. If it were not for Mr. Guan's extraordinary talent, how could he have achieved this? Unfortunately, he was troubled by illness last year and suddenly passed away at the end of the year. He loved to give and was generous. Whether they knew him or not, they mourned his death.</p>
<p>The 23rd was the date for the opening of the funeral. On Huanglu Road, the plain cars and white horses blocked the road. There were thousands of mourners, including Wang Zhengting and Yu Qiaqing. The mourning hall, from the corridor to the hall, was full of elegiac couplets and silk banners. The longest eulogy was written by Li Lishan, the host of the Fuxing Temple on Jade Emperor Mountain. The sentence reads, "You are the God of Fortune for the world. Your kindness is widespread. You have been tirelessly giving to the drowning and hungry in your life. Everyone says that good people are blessed by heaven and will surely enjoy a long life. Why did you suddenly suffer from a lingering illness for several years and lack a panacea? You abandoned the mortal world and said goodbye forever. Heaven has taken away my comrade. You passed away in the middle of the road. For ten years, we have supported and helped each other, and protected the Tao with great devotion. We have always admired the profoundness of the Xuan Decree and are determined to cultivate good results. One day, on the Three Life Stone, we will meet old friends again. Do not forget the wind and moon to prove the previous cause." It was written on a ten-foot-long silk, and the characters were also elegant. I also searched my brains and reluctantly composed a couplet: "Solemn Buddha appearance, Bodhisattva heart, happy to cultivate purity and joy, the soul returns to the ethereal and becomes a good fruit.洒脱神情, 金剛氣骨. Expressing beauty in words and deeds, the old generation has lost its model." I am ashamed of my clumsy writing and lack of talent. I am ashamed that I cannot describe Mr. Guan in the slightest.</p>
<p>At 2:30 in the afternoon, the funeral procession departed from Huanglu, passed through North Sichuan Road, and turned into Bazhi Road to Beizhan. There were five places of worship along the way. Mr. Guan believed in Taoism during his lifetime, so there were many Taoist priests, about fifty people. The ceremonial guards stretched for about a mile, extremely winding and slow. Passengers with quick mirrors competed to take pictures. By the time they arrived at Beizhan, it was almost four o'clock. Stationmaster Yuan Shaochang took good care of them and ordered the police to help the filial sons into the rest room for a short rest. Soon, the pallbearers carried the coffin to the scheduled carriage, so that they could be carried back to Wuxi tomorrow morning. With a coffin attached to the body, everything was over. After witnessing this, I could not help but feel sad and sigh. I still remember when I worked at Siemens, I often argued with German women because of my innate arrogance. Mr. Guan always supported me. When I resigned from Siemens and joined McCallie, he repeatedly gave me instructions. From this, I knew that Mr. Guan loved me deeply. Time flies, and life is like a dream. How could I know that Mr. Guan would pass away? I wrote this under the lamp, and I couldn't help but feel sad.</p>

<p>Xunxi Garden is built by a wealthy gentleman named Zhu in the same village. There is a Xiaoshi in the garden, about ten feet high, with a hole in the back, like a mouthful, with a hollow cavity in the middle. When the wind blows, it鳴, and sometimes the sound of呜呜 can be heard. Whenever the狂飈怒發, its sound is even louder. Listening to it in the静夜, it is like a虎嘯山谷, which makes people tremble.</p>
<p>Zhu is obsessed with Yuanzhang. The garden is full of怪石羅列, almost a hundred in number. Among them, some are疊如層巒, and some are悬若峭壁. The shapes are strange and cannot be 殫記. And Xiaoshi is the most.

The sentence reads, "You are the God of Fortune for the world. Your kindness is widespread. You have been tirelessly giving to the drowning and hungry in your life. Everyone says that good people are blessed by heaven and will surely enjoy a long life. Why did you suddenly suffer from a lingering illness for several years and lack a panacea? You abandoned the mortal world and said goodbye forever. Heaven has taken away my comrade. You passed away in the middle of the road. For ten years, we have supported and helped each other, and protected the Tao with great devotion. We have always admired the profoundness of the Xuan Decree and are determined to cultivate good results. One day, on the Three Life Stone, we will meet old friends again. Do not forget the wind and moon to prove the previous cause." It was written on a ten-foot-long silk, and the characters were also elegant. I also searched my brains and reluctantly composed a couplet: "Solemn Buddha appearance, Bodhisattva heart, happy to cultivate purity and joy, the soul returns to the ethereal and becomes a good fruit.洒脱神情, 金剛氣骨. Expressing beauty in words and deeds, the old generation has lost its model." I am ashamed of my clumsy writing and lack of talent. I am ashamed that I cannot describe Mr. Guan in the slightest.</p>
<p>At 2:30 in the afternoon, the funeral procession departed from Huanglu, passed through North Sichuan Road, and turned into Bazhi Road to Beizhan. There were five places of worship along the way. Mr. Guan believed in Taoism during his lifetime, so there were many Taoist priests, about fifty people. The ceremonial guards stretched for about a mile, extremely winding and slow. Passengers with quick mirrors competed to take pictures. By the time they arrived at Beizhan, it was almost four o'clock. Stationmaster Yuan Shaochang took good care of them and ordered the filial sons into the rest room for a short rest. Soon, the pallbearers carried the coffin to the scheduled carriage, so that they could be carried back to Wuxi tomorrow morning. With a coffin attached to the body, everything was over. After witnessing this, I could not help but feel sad and sigh. I still remember when I worked at Siemens, I often argued with German women because of my innate arrogance. Mr. Guan always supported me. When I resigned from Siemens and joined McCallie, he repeatedly gave me instructions. From this, I knew that Mr. Guan loved me deeply. Time flies, and life is like a dream. How could I know that Mr. Guan would pass away? I wrote this under the lamp, and I couldn't help but feel sad.</p>

<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>Xunxi Garden is built by a wealthy gentleman named Zhu in the same village. There is a Howling Stone in the garden, about ten feet high, with a hole in the back, like a mouthful, with a hollow cavity in the middle. When the wind blows, it makes a sound, and sometimes the sound of woo-woo can be heard. Whenever there is a狂飈怒發, its sound is even louder. Listening to it in the quiet night, it is like a tiger howling in the valley, which makes people tremble.</p>
<p>Zhu is obsessed with Yuanzhang. The garden is full of strange stones, almost a hundred in number. Among them, some are stacked like layers of mountains, and some are suspended like cliffs. The shapes are strange and cannot be described in detail. And Xiaoshi is the most. Some say that this stone is unlucky. Since Tongguang, it has changed owners ten times. Mr. Zhu did not believe it and bought it for a thousand gold. Before long, the owner died and the family business declined. And the survival of this stone is not yet known. So, in the darkness, there is also a number for things and people. I am afraid it cannot be borrowed. I will record it to express my remote sigh.</p>
<h3 id="e173">News of Fishing and Hunting <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Lonely Xu Sheng</p>
<p>A guest talked about fishing and hunting, which was quite novel and delightful. I recorded it to help with conversation. The coastal area of ​​eastern Zhejiang has a special product: wild ducks. They have flat beaks and brown feathers, and they fly in groups. They gather especially in fields and beaches because they eat barnyard millet. Hunters often tie grass into the shape of a human and insert it into the field. At first, the wild ducks are suspicious and afraid, and they all fly away. After a long time, they know it is harmless and no longer pay attention to it. Then, the hunters mix croton powder with grains and spread them on the field. Then, they hide among the grass bundles. After a while, the wild ducks gather and compete to peck at the grains. When the croton poison takes effect, the wild ducks all tremble and fall down one after another, unable to fly away. The hunters rush out and catch them, filling their bags without any effort. As the saying goes, "People die for wealth, and birds die for food." It is true.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that fishing is done with nets or hooks. However, the people of Yongbo are quite skilled at catching fish. The fisherman rolls flour into bait and sticks it to both ends of a bamboo silk. Each bamboo silk is tied to a line and suspended in a bamboo pole. There are probably hundreds of baits. They sink it into the water. After a long time, the fish come to swallow the bait. When the bait enters the mouth, the bamboo silk springs open and just holds the fish's mouth. It cannot escape. The fisherman raises the bamboo pole, and the fish are all suspended below it, as if they were being caught. He gets a lot of fish. It can be said that he is ingenious. I have heard that torches are used to catch crabs, and frog legs are used to hook frogs. Creatures that fly and crawl are ignorant and deserve to be caught. However, apes are primates, and they are also deceived by humans. It is said that there are many apes in Tiantai Mountain. They often come in groups in the bamboo forests and take wild fruits and bamboo shoots as usual. Therefore, the villagers plant trees in the mountains, wrapping them with bamboo shoots, so they look like bamboo shoots. When the monkeys come, one monkey will often stand upright on the bamboo shoot, and another monkey will tie it with a rope, pretending to break off the bamboo shoot. Then, they carry it away. The villagers use their intelligence. The monkeys initially do not know. When they are tied up and the bamboo shoot is not broken, the villagers come out and catch them, as easy as turning their hands. Alas. Human intelligence is above that of animals, so it is natural for animals to fail. However, human intelligence varies greatly. I</p>

<h3 id="e176">Slight Decline in the Foreign Market, Sales are Moderate <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: According to industry insiders, the market prices for silver dollars this year</p>
<p>are unlikely to increase in the short term. The biggest reason is the abundance of current holdings of foreign currency. Local supply and demand ultimately circulate in the market, without affecting existing reserves. Furthermore, recently, foreign silver is continuously arriving, further increasing the abundance of silver. Banknote issuance is increasing daily, and foreign currency also feels more abundant. Eventually, silk and cocoon sales will lead to repatriation, still remaining in the Shanghai market. From this perspective, Shanghai has a significant concern about being flooded with silver.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Spreads (Foreign Cents): The market mood was slightly sluggish in the morning. The interest rate spread slightly decreased by 1 hao, 2 hu, and 5 li, to 7 qian, 2 fen, 0.0375 hao. In the afternoon, it weakened further by 2 hao and 5 li, to 7 qian, 2 fen, 0.0125 hao. Recently, the situation has been fluctuating within a few hao, which shows a glimpse of the market's stability. (Silver Interest) Although interbank transactions in the check market have superficially returned to their original state, in reality, they are conducted with prudence, failing to meet expectations. Therefore, the supply and demand situation is exceptionally sluggish, significantly different from the past, leading to the silver interest rate consistently remaining within a few fen. Yesterday, the morning market was 5 fen, and the afternoon market was 3 fen, similar to the previous day. With the amount of cash outflowing daily, it will ultimately be a waste of time, with no added value to speak of.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The morning and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver dollars remained the same at 6 qian, 1 fen, 5 li, 2 hao and 5 si. Transactions were 2,000 jiao in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian, 9 fen, 6 li, 7 hao and 5 si in the morning market, and 5 qian, 9 fen, 6 li, 8 hao and 7 hu in the afternoon market. Transactions were 75,000 jiao in the morning market and 80,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,500 wen, to 393,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Inflow and Outflow: Yesterday's bank collection and remittance news was relatively bleak. Chinese merchants collected and remitted over 2.2 million in checks, foreign merchants collected and remitted 1.6 to 1.7 million. Collections for various goods' exchange rates, customs duties, and loan pledges exceeded 8 million. 500,000 was removed from the warehouse, and 300,000 was brought into the warehouse. Japanese banks collected and remitted over 2 million in various funds. 400,000 was removed from the warehouse. It was also heard that banks collected and made several hundred thousand in loan bills. Silver merchants and public firms collected over 27 million, cleared over 3.1 million, and various remittance routes collected over 1.1 million. Approximately 300,000 to 400,000 in cash was collected.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Collection and Remittance: In the market, foreign currency transfers and check clearing amounted to 1,315,000 in the morning market and 760,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were traded for 50,000 in the morning market, with no transactions in the afternoon market. Outside the market, banknote transactions were 134,000 in the morning market and 85,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank trading amounted to 600,000 in the morning market and 700,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions between foreign accounts at various banks amounted to over 1.3 million, with banknote inflows and outflows of 1.7 to 1.8 million. Regarding customer routes, 400,000 was shipped north, and 200,000 was used for rice purchases in the interior. Silver merchants and public firms collected 2.8 to 2.9 million, foreign currency clearings amounted to over 1.2 million, loans of foreign currency were over 1.4 million, and smaller silver shops exchanged banknotes and sold foreign currency drafts for 500,000 to 600,000.</p>

<p>Due to the handling of March futures trading of government bonds today, the securities exchange has temporarily suspended＊</p>
<p>trading. Regarding yesterday's market transaction situation, a total of 71,000＊</p>
<p>yuan of spot goods were opened, with demobilization accounting for 49,000 yuan, customs duties for 9,000 yuan, and other items accounting for only＊</p>
<p>several thousand yuan. Futures trading for May has already commenced, with active sales and purchases. In the＊</p>
<p>morning, transactions reached approximately 4 million, and in the afternoon, there were over 3 million yuan. Domestic tax bonds were the most active in the market, followed by extended continuation bonds. Other bonds remained quiet. Because it was the settlement period yesterday, large households' transactions were relatively balanced, and the supply and demand situation was equal. Bond prices suddenly stabilized. There were no major increases or decreases in the forward and after markets. Compared with the previous day, there were mixed increases and decreases. Because there has been no trading in spot goods for small bills of extended continuation bonds for a long time, yesterday's opening price was 87.5 yuan, a significant increase of 7,600 yuan compared with the middle of last month.</p>

<p>The yarn market is sluggish, and the spot yarn sales market is gradually showing signs of weakness. Because the season is declining and rural farmers will soon be busy with fieldwork, trading has stagnated. Spot yarn is tightly controlled by various factories, and selling prices remain unchanged. Spot Japanese yarn is scarce and increasingly difficult to decline. The inventory of domestic yarn is visibly increasing, sales are sluggish, and the future is difficult to be optimistic about. Furthermore, there are already 27,800 bales of yarn accumulated in yarn warehouses, including approximately 15,000 to 16,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings and Shepherd brands. With such a large batch of spot yarn accumulated and not moving, the yarn market has little hope.</p>
<p>Futures Yarn Trends: Near-term up, far-term down. The market opened quietly. Although bulls for the current month have no intention of taking delivery, the sellers have some relationship and have to buy in, so the speculative atmosphere is calmer. The near month increased by 2-3 qian, the far month decreased by 1.5-6 qian. In the afternoon, the current month remained quiet and increased by 3 qian, with quite a few clearing accounts. The far month increased by 1.3-4 qian. The total daily transaction volume was 17,450 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot Yarn Sales: Sales were quite sluggish. According to statistics, all buyers purchased only 790 bales for the day. 280 bales were purchased by fellow traders. Market prices were flat. Among the customer groups, the Sichuan group had the strongest appetite, accounting for 250 bales. In addition, 125 bales were purchased in the interior, 60 bales were purchased in Qinhuangdao, 170 bales were purchased in Xuzhou, 60 bales were purchased in Guangdong, and 125 bales were purchased by miscellaneous groups.</p>

<p>The cotton market is quiet because actual sales have stagnated and factory managers' intentions are very indifferent. According to one</p>
<p>observation, there are hopes for American cotton to decline again, so scattered buyers' interest is relatively low. Han merchants are holding tight and not releasing, and the cotton market's atmosphere is chaotic. As for the future changes,</p>
<p>there is no certainty to speak of.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton: Mediocre, with no increases or decreases. The market opened quietly, spot American cotton increased by 20 points, and the far term decreased slightly. Local people's hearts were flat, and the atmosphere was chaotic. The March contract has stopped trading, the April and May contracts decreased by 5 fen to 1 qian, and the far month was unchanged. The afternoon was still flat, with increases and decreases within 5 fen. The total daily transaction volume was 14,100 dan. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Although Japan's spinning industry is making rapid progress, all the raw cotton it needs depends on imports.</p>
<p>Since annexing Korea, it has been working hard on cotton planting, importing American Upland</p>
<p>cotton, and improving existing cotton varieties. Progress is gradually being made, as can be seen in the table below.</p>
<p>However, this source of supply is definitely not enough to meet the needs of Japan's entire spinning industry. (Cotton fields are measured in "tsubo" and production is in 400-pound bales.)</p>

<h3 id="e183">Grains: The He Xia Rice Market is Firm <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday it rained, and there weren't many sources. Because the monthly inventory is approaching,</p>
<p>stores' appetites didn't seem very strong. The price of northern japonica has reached its peak, and the</p>
<p>local authorities have issued a restriction notice, so the buying enthusiasm has calmed down slightly, but the price is still difficult to ease.</p>
<p>Top-quality japonica is still opening at over 21 yuan, but medium and lower-quality goods have been adjusted</p>
<p>according to the quality, no longer without any standards. The sales market for thin rice is very flat, and the market conditions are slightly</p>
<p>different, because the market price shifts with the buying customers' appetite, so there is a</p>
<p>difference of 1 jiao. Yangdu tip rice is selling quickly, and prices are continuously tight. Furthermore, foreign rice</p>
<p>is also reporting a firm increase. Local indica rice is extremely stable, and ordinary rice is flat, without any special features.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: River arrivals are not strong, but street sales are smooth. Transactions in Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang are</p>
<p>turning weaker. Although the appetites of buyers from nearby markets are not bad, they are buying cautiously</p>
<p>because at this market price, there will be days of strong arrivals. The amount of rice</p>
<p>coming from docks is reduced due to the weather. There are no major increases or decreases in the market. Various South Shanghai guides' early</p>
<p>rice market is firm and stable, with few arrivals, active sales. Yangxian opens at three</p>
<p>numbers, and prices are stable. The stocks of Duzi port and other indica rice at river warehouses are exhausted,</p>
<p>and transactions are intermittent. Baiyuan arrivals and sales are balanced, without any increases or decreases.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Foreign Rice Prices Soar Unabated <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Spot goods up two to three jiao... Futures also up</p>
<p>Yesterday, because domestic customers were competing to purchase and the arrival of goods was not sustained, foreign rice prices continued to increase.</p>
<p>Spot goods in the market were very scarce. The sellers who opened yesterday were all return goods, so they rose two to three jiao compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Spot goods are scarce and goods in transit are tight. Goods arriving tomorrow and the day after and goods delivered around April 2-3 all rose by about two jiao, but</p>
<p>the goods arriving recently had already been sold in advance, with spot goods totaling less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>There were only 8,000 bags of small-grain brown rice spot goods, priced at 12.85 yuan, which was still enough for domestic customers.</p>
<p>Number 1 Saigon opened to 15.45 yuan, and Mindang opened to 15.1 yuan. Number 1 goods in transit were the same as spot goods, and number 2 goods in transit were 14.8 yuan. Large-grain goods in transit were 14.15 yuan.</p>
<p>Although Tongxingtai and Haiyangshe sold 10,000 tons of large and small grains in futures, because domestic and interior customers were competing to purchase, the market price jumped by almost 1 qian.</p>
<p>The return goods totaled 1,800 tons, and the market was 2-3 fen better than the foreign firms' selling prices.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Tapioca Market is Gradually Improving, Especially in the Far Term <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Spot Sales are Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the tapioca market opened in the morning, the trend for each month remained positive. Because</p>
<p>foreign wheat reported good prices of 2-3-4 jiao, the current increases and decreases seemed to be purely controlled by the large</p>
<p>bulls. If there was a slight release, the market conditions would immediately loosen. Otherwise, there was a</p>
<p>trend of continuous increases. Regarding the actual situation, although factories' stocks were not very</p>
<p>large, Tianjin's attitude was indifferent, because this kind of market value could not be calculated.</p>
<p>There was very little possibility of purchasing, so although the standards were good, spot sales had turned weak.</p>
<p>When the afternoon market opened, the current month's trend showed signs of fluctuation. In April and May, large bull</p>
<p>customers had slightly reduced their positions, and large short customers had also covered their positions.</p>
<p>The market mood was slightly soft, but then the bulls gained strength again and tended to be firm and high. New flour in the far term had very strong purchasing enthusiasm outside the industry. Factories were not selling, and the market was exceptionally profitable. Considering</p>
<p>the current state, the near and far terms will likely continue to improve. As a</p>
<p>result, the current month was unchanged compared to the previous day, April was up by 5 li, May-July</p>
<p>were up by 1 fen and 2.5 li each, and August was up by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Wheat for Delivery Soars by Six Fen <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Spot goods opened for 13,000 bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, each month continued to increase sharply.</p>
<p>The opening price for the current month in the morning was still considered fair, but in the afternoon, because there were still a small number of short positions that needed to be covered, the opening price was raised by 4 fen, and then it remained firm.</p>
<p>The total amount of deliveries was 60 truckloads, of which local factories accounted for 70-80%, and the remainder was collected by traders.</p>
<p>The new crop in the far term had a very bullish market mood because rice prices were increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Buyers in the interior were still continuing to absorb, so the price was also raised step by step. As a result, the</p>
<p>current month suddenly increased by 6 fen compared to the previous day, April increased by 4 fen, and June-August</p>
<p>increased by 3 fen each. The spot market conditions were very good for the factories. The entire market opened for 10,000</p>
<p>and 3,000 bags, opening for Suzhou wheat, Guandian wheat, Qingjiangpu wheat at 5 taels, 1 qian,</p>
<p>1 fen, Jiangxi wheat at 4 taels, 6 qian, 8 fen, Xianghe wheat at 4 taels, 7 qian,</p>
<p>Hankou wheat at 4 taels, 8 qian, 7 fen, 4 taels, 7 qian, 5 fen, 4 taels, 5 qian, 7</p>

<h3 id="e187">Silk and Tea: Before the Inspection Period, Chinese Silk Sales Were Busy <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Firms are Urgently Pressing for Delivery... To be Shipped Before April 1</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau scheduled to inspect exported Chinese silk, but because the manufacturers</p>
<p>were unprepared, the deadline was extended to April 1. Before the deadline, the bureau would issue an exemption certificate for inspection and release with customs approval. It is now known that the April 1 deadline for silk inspection by European firms has arrived. In addition to</p>
<p>shipping out the silks stored in foreign warehouses in batches, they are now sending letters to each Chinese silk merchant who has agreed to sell futures silk, asking them to deliver the</p>
<p>futures silk for this month in advance, so that they can be shipped out before the inspection period.</p>
<p>As a result, in recent days, Chinese merchants who have agreed to sell futures silk have been busy delivering to foreign firms, weighing and</p>
<p>packaging, and the overseas silk cable to Shanghai has also been strong. Because Chinese merchants are holding firm on their costs, the prices have turned from firm to increased. Yesterday, Lianna and others purchased 80 bales of white silk, and Qianli purchased 40 bales of grey silk, and the prices have all risen sharply by 5 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e188">New Information on Xiuwu Black Tea <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The black tea produced in Xiushui, Wuning, Tonggu, and other counties is a major export from Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>In recent years, both the production volume and sales market have increased compared to previous years. Merchants traveling to the mountains to purchase tea have also become increasingly prevalent. Last year, tea firms in the Xiuwu area, including those from Anhui, Guangdong, and locally based groups, totaled more than thirty. The cost of mountain tea is not as high as that of Keemun tea, and the market shows signs of recovery. However, due to the impact of the suspended operations of the Sino-Russian Association in transit, sales to Russia have come to a standstill. Demand from England and France has decreased, and the lower prices have resulted in significant losses for most tea firms. This year, although new tea is about to enter the market, only about a dozen firms from Anhui, Guangdong, and local groups are preparing to enter the mountains for processing. The rest are adopting a wait-and-see approach, and many are temporary in nature. If the situation stabilizes in the future and finances become more accessible, it is possible that new firms may join. According to tea farmers in the Xiuwu mountains, the tea trees were also damaged by the cold and snow pressure last winter, causing frostbite to the branches. With the Qingming Festival approaching, although tea buds are emerging, they are not as lush and vigorous as in previous years. It is predicted that this year's output will definitely be reduced compared to previous years.</p>

<h3 id="e190">The Ongoing Book Collection Campaign at Great China University <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Great China University, which has been established for more than seven years, has always had a strong atmosphere of teacher-student cooperation. Its excellent achievements today can largely be attributed to the nurturing of this atmosphere. Recently, a so-called book collection campaign has been launched, which is another manifestation of teacher-student cooperation.</p>
<p>Originally, the university's library was not fully equipped, and the books it contained were not sufficient for the students' needs. Although each student had to pay two yuan for library fees per semester, and professors also occasionally donated books, it was ultimately limited. Therefore, when the university applied for registration last year, the Ministry of Education expressed deep dissatisfaction with this point and encouraged efforts to improve it. Now, the ongoing book collection campaign seems to be making some progress in this regard. This campaign was planned by the university's Library Committee and is scheduled to run from April 21st to May 4th. The collection method is as follows: each student is required to collect at least three Chinese books, each worth more than three yuan, or at least five English books, each worth more than one yuan. Those who do not have books will pay a substitute fee of five yuan. Professors are required to collect at least three Chinese books, each worth more than six yuan, or at least five English books, each worth more than two yuan. Those who do not have books will pay a substitute fee of ten yuan. There are also corresponding measures for alumni. In addition to the above collection methods, there are also incentive measures. In the future, the first-place winner with the most books collected individually will be awarded a silver shield by the university, and the group with the most books will be given a velvet banner to show encouragement. It is predicted that this campaign will achieve remarkable results. (Shi Duo)</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Volleyball Star of Chihtze University <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Honestly, this is not self-deprecation. Apart from the men's basketball team at Chihtze University, which is somewhat presentable, the others are simply not worth mentioning, especially the women's sports, which are even more embarrassing. Unexpectedly, the sports field, which has been silent for a long time, has recently seen some female students excitedly engaging in sports. Among the volleyball team, Ms. Zhu Youlan is particularly skilled. Her passing and spiking are both powerful and accurate. Calling her a volleyball star is not an exaggeration. I think we have gained a lot of glory with such a star, and I hope that Ms. Zhu will lead the female students to practice diligently so that they can compete for a place in the women's volleyball team in the future.

<p>The Nanguo Art Society's regular exhibition was mentioned in yesterday's newspaper. The original address was the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road in this city. However, due to unresolved negotiations, the society has borrowed the coffee room on the upper floor of the Paris Grand Theatre (west end of Hualong Road) on Avenue Joffre. The location is suitable, and there are many exhibits. The exhibition will be open for three days from today (the 28th) at noon until the 30th of this month. All are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e193">The Preparatory Course Issue at Jiaotong University <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Since its reorganization in 1927, Jiaotong University has focused on abolishing primary and secondary schools and concentrating on developing the university itself. After the persistent appeals of students' parents in primary and secondary schools, the high school department was changed to a preparatory course, and the junior high and primary schools were changed to the private Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School. Graduates could still be promoted, but only until 1932. The establishment of the preparatory course at the school was not originally intended. The Ministry of Education recently issued a notice ordering all universities to abolish preparatory courses. After receiving the order, Jiaotong University held a school affairs meeting and resolved to stop admitting new students to the preparatory first year starting this semester. However, due to the contract with Nanyang Primary and Secondary School, graduates of Nanyang can still be promoted to the preparatory first year, but no new students will be recruited. After the contract expires in 1932, the preparatory course will be gradually abolished, and by 1935, there will be no preparatory course at all. The school also noted that the academic level of students from outside is generally poor. If the first year of the undergraduate program recruits students, it will be very difficult. Therefore, it is proposed to extend the university by one year, and applicants must be high school graduates and study for one more year, which is actually a disguised preparatory course. (Quan)</p>

<p>The Sales of Zhongxi Mingxing Floral Water are Booming: The Zhongxi Pharmacy on Sima Road announced that the Mingxing Floral Water issued by the pharmacy is of excellent quality. Because the fragrance is lasting, elegant and economical, the women often buy and use the floral water instead of perfume. As a result, sales have increased sharply. The sales in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces are even greater. The daily export volume has reached more than 2,600 boxes. The pharmacy is now seeking to engage a reputable foreign goods merchant in this port to exclusively sell the product.</p>

<p>Chairman of Taihua Hosts a Banquet: The Dahua Leather Factory on Avenue Petain said that Mr. Zheng Hongnian, Vice Minister of Finance, is the current Chairman of the factory's board. When the new manager, Mr. Mao Heyuan, took office some time ago, Minister Zheng was unable to attend due to business. Recently, Minister Zheng was in Shanghai on business. In the evening, he hosted a banquet at the Meiyuan Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, inviting the directors, supervisors, and the new manager of the company. Those who attended included Lin Xisheng, Gao Shizi, Zhu Jiliang, Mao Heyuan, Yu Jingshan, Shen Shouyun, Ye Wangsheng, Wu Zemin, and Li Zunan. During the banquet, new manager Mao rose to report the factory's expansion plan for this year. The factory's products, such as the "Flying Wheel" brand red leather and lake green bottom leather, have a great reputation, and the materials and styles are completely the same as those of famous European and American factories. In order to promote industry, the Ministry of Finance has specially approved that the factory's products are exempt from double taxation at domestic ports and are completely tax-free when sold abroad, so the sales are even wider. The factory's head office has now moved to the fourth floor of No. 24, the Bund, to facilitate contact with merchants.</p>
<p>Huilu Clothing Department's Contribution: Huilu Company on Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, announced that the company's clothing department intends to improve women's clothing and adapt it to the times. They have specially invited Mrs. Canaud, a famous French fashion seamstress, to design new styles of clothing for women to wear at each hour of the day. All fashionable clothes are available, and are matched with various exquisite fabrics from the Huilu clothing department. Most of the Shanghai-made fashion seamstresses use samples from European and American magazines as references. They do not know that the figure and posture of Chinese women are completely different from those of European and American women. If they blindly imitate, they will lose the beauty. Therefore, Mrs. Canaud, who makes fashionable clothes for Chinese women, uses the fabric and color, and the wearer's figure, as the standard. The styles she makes are all original and exceptionally clever. Mrs. Canaud's clothing samples are extremely expensive. In order to thank Chinese women for their patronage, the company is offering this service for free. The company's one-yuan discount period has two days remaining. The spring fabrics in the clothing department range from one yuan and fifty cents to more than ten yuan. The materials are durable and the colors are exquisite. It is really rare to find them on the market.</p>

Last year, Dunlop tennis balls were selected in no less than 750 tennis championships. Due to Dunlop's popularity, it is predicted that even more championships will use Dunlop tennis balls this year.</p>
<p>Colleagues of the China Wharf Company Host a Public Banquet for the General Manager: The A. Edouard China Wharf Company announced that on the 26th, the company's accounting department, general affairs department, engineering department, documentation department, and wharf manager hosted a public banquet at the Dadong Restaurant to honor General Manager Chen Gengxin's new achievements. Mr. He delivered a speech on behalf of the group, saying that Mr. Chen's knowledge and experience have always been admired by colleagues. His departure is a great loss. Today, a simple meal is prepared to express our heartfelt feelings, and we hope that Mr. Chen will continue to provide us with guidance. Then, Mr. Chen gave a speech, saying that the Wharf Company was established in July of the 17th year of the Republic. For nearly three years, the manager has planned and operated with great effort, and the scale has been roughly established. Each wharf has been carefully managed, and the business has improved. Now that Mr. Chen is leaving, colleagues will never forget him and hope to receive his guidance from time to time. Finally, Manager Chen gave a speech, saying that he is not very capable and has not achieved much in the past three years. He is ashamed to receive such favor from everyone, and he is especially undeserving of the feast. Recalling the time spent with everyone, he is gratified in three ways: first, in this prosperous city, everyone is able to avoid chasing after extravagance; second, everyone has worked hard in their respective positions; third, everyone has been able to work together in harmony. From these three points, it can be seen that the company's business has been developing steadily, and everyone's future is bright. After the banquet, a photo was taken, and the party ended in joy at 9:30 PM.</p>

<p>(7) A Trip Along the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>Shanghai's waterways, apart from the Huangpu River, are second only to the Suzhou Creek. There are many wharves along the river. Travelers coming to Shanghai from the Su (Suzhou), Chang (Changzhou), and inland river areas mostly disembark at the wharves of Tianhou Temple Bridge and Pentang Lane Bridge. Every morning at eight or nine o'clock, before the small ferries depart, many old and young, men and women, crowd the wharves. Soon, the whistle blows a few times, and wisps of black smoke billow from the chimneys onto the shore. The small ferries gradually leave the riverbank and head west, towing seven or eight boats of various sizes behind them, connected end to end, resembling a long snake winding its way along. This is a very common sight on the Suzhou Creek. When we read in the newspaper about bandits robbing ferries on the lake, we are reminded of the impressions we get on the banks of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Compared to the Huangpu River, the Suzhou Creek is naturally far inferior. The Huangpu River is like a large courtyard of a house, with its doors wide open, delighting those who see it. The Suzhou Creek is not like that; it is more like an alley behind the kitchen, not only cramped in its location, but also with everything carrying a dirty appearance. Therefore, along the Huangpu River, there are many people strolling with their hands behind their backs, gazing at the river view, while the situation along the Suzhou Creek is very different. In the section between Waibaidu Bridge and Tianhou Temple Bridge, there are still some places where one can linger and appreciate. However, the further west one goes, the more different it becomes. When one reaches the area of Tanziwan and Xiaoshadu, it feels like leaving the city altogether, with a desolate and bleak atmosphere pervading both banks. Especially the section near Guangzhao Villa, where the population is sparse, is like being neighbors with the land of ghosts.</p>
<p>The scenery along the banks of the river can be divided into three different periods. If we use the bridges spanning the river as a standard, then the section west of Waibaidu Bridge and east of Tianhou Temple Bridge is like a young person, full of vigor and joy, with the architecture and scenery on both banks exuding neatness and splendor everywhere. The section between Tianhou Temple Bridge and the sampan factory bridge at the end of Maigen Road is the most complex and bustling, with the most boats in the river. This tedious and endless situation is like a person in middle age, desperately trying to solve their life's problems. As for the sampan factory bridge, it is the last bridge on both banks of the Suzhou Creek. West of it, there are no more bridges, and crossing the river requires a ferry. The scenery on both banks becomes increasingly desolate, like an old person whose vitality is diminishing. In the area of Tanziwan and Xiaoshadu, many people from Jiangbei live on small boats, but these boats never float in the water. Instead, they are called upon to leave the water, land, and live by the shore. These lifeless boats can well represent the general situation of this section of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>The first section of the Suzhou Creek includes Waibaidu Bridge, Libaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Jiangxi Road Bridge, and Tianhou Temple Bridge (Henan Road Bridge). The "Bai" character in Waibaidu Bridge is probably a misprint of the character "Bai" (擺), meaning to set up or arrange. That place also has a name called "Touba" (頭壩, first dam). What was the scenery of the Suzhou Creek like decades ago? These two characters can tell us something about it. Standing on the bridge and looking east, the water of the Huangpu River flows into the Suzhou Creek right under your feet. To the south is the Bund Park, a corner that forms a wall where the two waters meet. Waibaidu Bridge is also called "Huayuan Bridge" (花園橋, Garden Bridge) in the west, and the Bund Park is indeed very closely related to it. There is indeed a garden dedicated to growing flowers under the bridge, which can be seen at a glance from the bridge. Among them, a glass greenhouse is exceptionally quiet. Against the wall is a self-flowing spring, with water flowing from above into the pool, the green shadows reflected on it, making the interior even more serene.</p>
<p>Looking west from the bridge, the nearest is the Erbaidu Bridge. Both banks of the Erbaidu Bridge also have "leisurely and elegant" decorations. On the south side of the riverbank, there are often yachts burning gasoline, staying on the river. The inside of the boats is cleaned like a hospital. The old boatmen also show a sense of self-respect. Except when their masters go out for a tour, they follow along. On weekdays, they clean and scrub the boat all day long, so that dirt and dust are completely avoided. Among the boats entering and exiting the Suzhou Creek, some carry passengers and some tow cargo. Nine out of ten boats are bloated, only the yachts are slender, with well-proportioned bodies, like the ladies of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Between Baidu Bridge and Sichuan Road Bridge, there are churches, hospitals, hotels, cinemas, and flower shops along the banks. Especially near Libaidu Bridge on the south bank, the roads are flat, and the scenery is quiet and secluded. When the sun is about to set, the river breeze blows from the east, caressing people's faces, no less pleasant than strolling along the riverbank. The post office at the northern end of Sichuan Road Bridge is the only important building on the banks of the Suzhou Creek. The commercial council of Tianhou Temple Bridge also has its due position. When Tianhou Temple was reorganized, there were many vendors and astrologers inside. There are also many people who come to worship the gods. Besides the City God Temple and the Red Temple, Tianhou Temple can also be counted as the third most important place. Now, the front door is deserted, not as good as before. This is also a change related to the banks of the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Looking at the vehicles and pedestrians passing by the bridge, the scene is almost a unique feature of the banks of the Suzhou Creek. There is an iron frame on the Waibaidu Bridge, crisscrossing and arching high above the bridge surface. At night, when the tram passes over the bridge, looking from afar, the lights in the carriages shine through the gaps, which is very interesting. At night on the banks of the Suzhou Creek, you can also see the spires of the three department stores, towering in the air. Looking back to the east, although there are tall buildings behind, the lights on the boats are reflected in the water, rippling and swaying. The air on both banks seems to be much quieter, but a motorcycle quickly drives across the bridge, and the silent air undulates like the river again.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Eunuch Sanbao in Nanyang by YS <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>(10) Sanbao Cave</p>
<p>This was Eunuch Sanbao's seventh voyage, and it was also his last trip to Nanyang. At that time, it was 1433. He and his more than 20,000 soldiers and civilians sailed to Nanyang on dozens of "big-eyed chicken" ships.</p>
<p>Once, as these dozens of "big-eyed chicken" ships were sailing smoothly, for some reason, a monstrous wave suddenly arose, and the wind began to howl. These dozens of "big-eyed chicken" ships swayed like cradles, drifting in the vast ocean.</p>
<p>At this time, the soldiers and civilians on these dozens of "big-eyed chicken" ships were all vomiting. They vomited so severely that they naturally had no strength left. At this time, even the virtuous Eunuch Sanbao could not think of any remedy. This group of vomiting, pitiful soldiers and civilians could only lie down in the cradle-like "big-eyed chicken" ships, "resigned to fate."</p>
<p>Soon, the waves gradually grew larger, and the wind gradually became stronger. At this time, the swaying of the ships became even more violent. The mountain-overturning, sea-swallowing swaying made that group of vomiting soldiers and civilians even more intensely unbearable.</p>
<p>At this time, Eunuch Sanbao himself began to vomit. He could not think of any way to remedy the situation. The thought of "resigning to fate" may have been floating in his mind at this time. So, other than lying down, everything else seemed to be of no concern to him.</p>
<p>The wind and waves grew stronger day by day. This was already the third day, and the waves still showed no signs of calming down.</p>
<p>The wind and waves on the fourth day were even more fierce. These dozens of "big-eyed chicken" ships were originally sailing together, but at this time, they had already been scattered by the wind and waves. However, those pitiful soldiers and civilians lying in the "big-eyed chicken" ships were still unaware of this.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, Eunuch Sanbao could not bear this suffering any longer, so he began to curse.</p>
<p>"If I still have to suffer such great wind and waves, I would rather die quickly!" As soon as he finished speaking, a huge wave overturned his lone ship. As a result, the people on board were completely drowned, and the ship slowly sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Just as Eunuch Sanbao's ship sank, the wind and waves stopped the next day. Who knew that not far from the site where Eunuch Sanbao's ship sank, there were small, desolate islands?</p>
<p>Time flashed like lightning. A month quickly passed. At this time, in a remote part of that desolate island, a cave emerged. From a distance, that cave looked like an overturned ship. The cave was full of strange trees. Those trees hung down in a messy way, like iron chains. This cave, it is said, was Eunuch Sanbao's ship. Later, for some reason, this legend of Sanbao Cave spread among the people in the south.</p>

<p>According to German reports, Dr. Schtanfiel of Germany has recently used gold preparations for injections to cure patients with arteriosclerosis, which has attracted much attention in the medical community. The doctor first experimented with mice in the research room of the University of Hamburg, and then tried intravenous and subcutaneous injections on about 20 patients, all of which were quickly successful. Among the gold preparations, "Thai Er Genaier" has the best results, because gold has the property of dilating capillaries and also stimulates spherical cell tissues, which is also related to the secretion of secretions, so it is effective for arteriosclerosis.</p>

<p>In China today, where there are more people than jobs, university graduates who have received higher education are unemployed and have nothing to do. Therefore, the general public does not trust the school system, thinking that schools are not places for cultivating talents, unlike the imperial examination system in the past, where scholars could easily dedicate themselves to the country and do something earth-shattering. This view is indeed correct, and students generally feel that studying is boring, and their grades are therefore poor. The reason why education in our country cannot be improved is probably because of this. Jiaotong University in this city is directly under the Ministry of Railways, has a history of 30 years, and its reputation has long been spread throughout China. It is divided into four colleges: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Transportation Management. These four colleges are all directly related to the transportation industry. The cultivation of railway transportation talents completely depends on the school, so the responsibility it bears is indeed not small. In the past, although there were regulations for graduates to be sent to various railways for internships by the Ministry, the standards for appointment after the internship were not regulated. Therefore, many interns were treated harshly by railway staff, and were unable to be promoted to formal positions after the internship, resulting in unemployment. Since last year, the vice president of the school has been held concurrently by Li Zhaohuan, the vice minister of railways. Li is enthusiastic about education and believes that the lack of regulations to guarantee the appointment of graduates is sufficient to affect the students' performance at school. Therefore, he proposed at the ministerial meeting to formulate the "Regulations for the Registration, Appointment, and Guarantee of Jiaotong University Graduates," which has been passed and will be implemented soon. From now on, Jiaotong University students will not have to worry about unemployment, and they will be promoted grade by grade, with rules to guarantee their positions. The important points of the regulations are listed below: (1) All graduates of Jiaotong University directly under the Ministry of Railways who have interned on various railways for one year will be promoted to formal technicians, and their rank will be classified as fifth grade fourth class to first class (see attached table below). (2) Technicians who have been registered and appointed by various railways shall not be dismissed from their positions unless due to negligence. (3) If any railway dismisses a technician without cause, the technician may request the director in writing to state the reasons. If a formal reply is not received, a request should be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for verification and decision. (4) Technicians of various railways who have achieved excellent results for more than one year may be promoted by one grade.</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Metropolitan Nature of Modern Art by Zhang Ruogu <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>In the March issue of the Japanese magazine "New Tide," there is a review by Mr. Niikyo entitled "The Metropolitan Nature of Modern Art." The main idea of ​​that paper is to explain that urban literature and art have become the main elements of modern art. The author first cites the phenomenon that film art tends to portray urban life, such as tall buildings, street scenes, crowds of pedestrians, and transportation organizations, all of which have become indispensable urban portrayal backgrounds for modern films.</p>
<p>The great film "Berlin Metropolis Symphony" and other films depicting the lives of New York or Paris have been warmly welcomed by people in major cities around the world.</p>
<p>All literary and artistic works that take urban life as the central expression can give modern people considerable seduction and satisfaction. Many colorful entertainment organizations in cities, such as theaters, cinemas, concert halls, dance halls, amusement parks, hotels, sports fields, swimming pools, etc., have been regarded by general writers as excellent themes for movies, paintings, or popular novels. "Urban life," "urban enjoyment," "urban color," "urban feeling," "urban love," "urban melancholy," "urban literature," "urban art"... a long string of new terms has also emerged accordingly.</p>
<p>Mr. Niikyo also discusses the opposition and comparative distinction between urban literature and peasant literature. The rapid pace of urban nature, the scientific clarity and convenience, the expansion of new sensations, moderate enjoyment, trial marriages, and the various issues of marriage bankruptcy are exquisitely reasoned. Limited to space, it is impossible to translate and list them in detail here, for which I am deeply sorry.</p>
<p>Recently, in the Japanese literary and art circles, a great wave of literary and artistic inclination towards urbanism has been set off. It is expected that this emerging literature and art will soon emerge in the Japanese literary and art world, which is an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>The late, famous Japanese critic, Mr. Katagami Shin, wrote an essay entitled "Urban Life and Modern Literature." He affirmed that the most humane thing in human life is urban life, and the most intense desires in life also exist in urban life. Therefore, in a sense, urban life is a symbol of human life. To admire urban life is to be passionately in love with the most intense human life.</p>
<p>Urban life is always the activity center of a country, a nation, or an international nation. Therefore, in all aspects, there must be the light of life actively moving there. Urban life has acute moods, but lacks the taste of slowness and leisure, and it is also the most stimulating. It is just like the sun at noon, with light, heat, and the liveliness of color, but on the other hand, it is inevitable that there is a kind of rotten and decadent shadow, and a dark image covered with fatigue and weariness.</p>
<p>Since urban life has its beautiful, rich, and bright advantages, it also naturally has ugly, monotonous, and dark places. Therefore, some people praise urban life, while others curse urban life.</p>
<p>The literature and art produced in urban areas are those that exaggerate the subtlety and acuteness of the senses and regard the strong stimulation and graceful emotions as life. The characteristic and value of so-called urban art is that even in the decline of the senses or the fatigue of the spirit, there is still a kind of "demand for life," and even in the sigh of failure, there is still a strong desire and love for life.</p>
<p>Those who curse urban life and urban art are definitely not because their bodies and minds are exhausted, but because their hearts for loving life and admiring the world have long withered. At the same time, they have lost that sense of wonder and mystery about their own lives. We cannot but express considerable grief for their great loss.</p>
<p>Recent art, such as futurism and expressionism, expresses that kind of turbulent, uneasy, and stimulating urban sentiment. It uses trams, cars, moving pictures, and licentious demons to replace those fields, villages, water surfaces, sail shadows, and pure virgins as the themes of paintings. A group of artists all jumped out of the mountains and rivers and gathered in the metropolis...</p>
<p>The places of entertainment in the metropolis are extremely complex. These many places of entertainment can make you taste endless fun and get infinite inspiration. If you sit in a coffee shop, you will definitely meet that seventeen or eighteen-year-old virgin, and under the red lights and green wine, she will carefully recount her past romance to you...</p>
<p>In the Japanese literary world, there have recently been so-called new sensory writers. Their creations are all newly created based on modern Japanese urban life. Mr. Liu Na'ou has selected and translated them into a collection entitled "Erotic Culture." Each article is very sharp and lively and lovely. Among them, Yokomitsu Riichi's "The Seventh Floor Exercise" and Iketani Shinzaburo's "Bridge" are the most beautiful.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Na'ou was also the first to introduce Paul Morand ABC, the leading writer of modern French urban literature, to China (there is Mr. Dai Wangshu's selected translation collection "Celestial Jade Beauty"). What Morand has achieved in his literary efforts is the new method of writing, the new form of speech, the new tone, the reform of foreign-flavored writing, and the renewal of custom research, a method that makes people laugh and smile. Although the devious twists and turns of his articles are a bit too novel and too numerous, they are actually very interesting and will not cause any disgust. The painting characteristics of Morand's articles and the clever composition method of color and line are worthy of our detailed research.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Liu Na'ou so highly respects French and Japanese new sensory writers, in his own creations, such as "Two People at Different Times," "Game," and "Program," etc., are all very impressive works, each filled with a strong urban color and a very sharp urban feeling.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, in addition to loving the passionate works of French Romantic writers of the 19th century, I am also quite interested in the works of the above-mentioned new sensory writers.</p>
<p>But rather than saying that I admire the content of the new sensory works, I would rather say that I admire their form and style. Although Morand's novels are good at expressing the pain of human nature in urban life, I am very dissatisfied with the cold, ridiculing attitude that lacks sympathy. I only love his skillful style, his strokes are very fresh and lovely, it is a film-like flash method, the summary order method of emotional analysis, the abbreviation method, the separation method, and the listing method. His collection skills of sporadic characters can only be used by clever and clever artists, but if we look at the nature and content of the works, Morand's works cannot be included in the ranks of world-class writers. The fragment about the photography of department stores in Iketani Saburo's "Bridge" is also unusually lively and lovely, and the artistic quality of that "Bridge" is also quite outstanding, but it is not that I want to erase the Japanese writers, I always feel that Liu Na'ou's works are much more lovely, because in Na'ou's several works, not only are the technical aspects very delicate and precise, but what I admire most is that he does not have a cold attitude. His works are not only rich in the color of oriental cities and thicker than the atmosphere of the oriental world, but also have a tolerant temperament unique to the Chinese nation, which is far beyond the reach of the trivialities of the Japanese nation and the satire of the French nation.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The tendency of modern art to be metropolitan is just in its ascendant. This article by the author is only a narrative of its general outline. However, Chinese old artists have not felt this trend at all. At a recent exhibition of a certain country's paintings, there seemed to be a few such declarations: "The spring is bright and the scenery is pleasant. At the head of the Huangpu River, everything that catches the eye is a field of sound, color, goods, and profits, with very few places of noble entertainment. Therefore, we gather this meeting to send away elegant interests," etc. This is really starting from nowhere.</p>
<p>The "Art World" on the 24th of this month contained the entry "The first collection of hidden essentials has been published in four types" was mistakenly inserted. This is hereby corrected.</p>
