<h3>巴黎晨報言筆批評國際公斷總約</h3>
<p>兩年來正式加入者祗有八國</p>
<p>重要争議皆劃出公斷範圍外</p>
<p>世界社譯巴黎晨報總主筆勞常鼐氏最近所寫論文云公斷安全減軍三者乃未來和平殿堂之三基石關於此層在日内瓦人人意見一致但對於此三基石奠置之先後則人人意見不同最後薛西爾貴族乃提議使此三石同時安置入土</p>
<p>余不欲對此聚訟有所左右而欲指出三基石中之一石目下所處之地位是即公斷之石即和平殿堂之主要礎石而於聚訟中引起困難最少者也日内瓦之一專家近告余云（對於一個主義最公平又最簡單如國際公斷者而三四十國經兩年之討論所得結果僅僅有此殊使人對之喪氣此正如一球因轉運太過致失其圓形矣）</p>
<p>國際公斷主義斷然爲世界上最公平最簡單之一主義毫無可欵有人類即有争端故必須設一公斷法庭使平人類間一切之争關於此點一切國際會議之參加者莫不首肯顧一到須將此協定以黑墨寫上白紙之時即有一種惡神之邪風吹動於條約起草者之四圍於是起草者之筆與文字不相容文字又與意思不相容蓋人人視此爲一種巨物人人欲參預其誔生於是争閧復起</p>
<p>所謂（解决國際争議之公斷總約）在日内瓦之所遭者即是上述情形之好例關於該約經若干時輟時作的討論之後瑞典一國忽提議應將司法性質之争議及政治性質之争議加以分别夫争議即是争議何以有時應劃出争議範圍之外誠爲一般人所不解豈若干争議中不含可以引起戰争之同一危機耶</p>
<p>不寗惟是瑞典又提議凡司法性質之争議訴諸海牙國際法廷政治性質之争議則訴諸一種特别調停委員會而由國際聯盟會之行政院執最後判决之權各國中如英國熱烈贊成分司法争議及政治争議爲兩類之議而他國更有建議兩行分類再定例外者於是經兩年之修改復修改之後此（解决國際争議之公斷總約）於一九二八年六月間始得正式出世該約共四十七條分爲四章觀其内容寗爲一種條例手續之混雜物但於此混雜物之中有一事乃極明瞭者即第三十九條規定一切國家可依如下之藉辭而逃避公斷甲·争議發生於加入總約之前者不公斷乙凡關於國際公法所許國家獨斷之事件之争議不公斷丙凡·凡關於特别事件如領土法律等之争議不公斷噫一般人至此又將呼天而問如上三項之争議旣劃出於公斷範圍之外尚有何争議被留出而供公斷者乎</p>
<p>然此猶非最惡也最惡者此種麻煩討論審愼起草之（解决國際争議之公斷通約）實際上竟爲世界之人民及其政府所漠視也讀者諸君亦知彼自稱爲國際聯盟會員及年年發表和平論之四十國其已正式通告國聯秘書廳彼已遵守公斷總約者有幾國耶蓋實止八國耳即瑞典比利時丹麥挪威荷蘭芬蘭盧森堡及西班牙是法國行將加入可以無欵因法下院已一致决議令政府加入該約而上院之必批准亦只遲早問題耳如是經兩載强之時日承認依公斷解决争議祗有九國而英國與其屬領及德意匈三國曁正在高唱立即裁軍之諸國均尚未加入批准之列</p>
<p>吾人至此可以斷言國際公斷於二年來進步甚遲假令此是和平殿堂之基石之一則是一極不穩固之基石祗能於其上造一紙屋而已</p>

<h3>留法學生鄒福松發明食鹽治膚病及用電養魚與種植法</h3>
<p>海水魚可變淡水魚</p>
<p>留法學生鄒福松在巴黎聖路易國家醫院試騐用食鹽醫治皮膚病結查有奇效對陰囊重癬痒致難忍西人百藥無效鄒君多次的試騐用熱水預先洗滌半分鐘後用細鹽加上磨擦并無疼痛乃用熱水洗清再加細鹽磨擦如是者兩三次約共五六分鐘以後用熱水洗清試乾即可如是照行繼續三天（每天只要一次）此法甚簡并無痛苦不需用電亦不用藥輕者一二次即愈重者即十餘年之老病三四次亦必全愈此法對於無皮膚病之人亦可應用可照法用細鹽及熱水將陰囊全部磨擦可使發生熱度血量增加無論何人尤其是運動家或遠行而歸身體疲倦應用此法尤易獲益云</p>
<p>按鄒氏研究凡癬及任何皮膚病之在全身者用上法磨擦洗滌拭乾後再用紫電光發射器磨擦約十分至十五分鐘（視部位之大小而定）廯之在陰囊上者不需用電應用方法後全身愈快腦筋清爽</p>

<h3>關於復旦曦聲社</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>這一學期中復旦的素負盛名的壁報潮又如波濤澎湃般地汹湧起來了自開爲起截至現在此先後所發刋的壁報如短波無線電紫鴿閩潮燦爛反晨等不十來種其中最采的最使當局者所注目的莫如按期出版從未延期的曦聲社所主編的（曦聲）了它是每三日出版一次内容極形豐富有正確的評論有趣味的東宫春秋有敏捷的關於學校當局的消息更有嚴整的批評文字因爲它最有成績的一步工作就是以中國文藝界今後的趨勢及客觀的需要而來估量普羅文學的没落同時以精密的睛光來分析普羅作家的内幕這些自從曦聲上發表了之後極引起一般同學的同情由此看來普羅文學在中國文壇僅有很短的歷史便告壽终正寢這也是必然的現象曦聲壁報在復旦能夠成爲最有力者也是爲了這個原故</p>
<p>復旦的壁報資格最老者我們不得不首推短波無線電它底消息很靈通因爲復旦五日刋還未曾出版之前但在這無線電上已先它露佈出來了所以一般好奇心的同學對於它很表懽迎在它每一期出版之前必定有許多男女同學一叢一叢地在那裏贍首探觀尤其是東宫裏的比較稍露頭角的小姐常合羞似的挾身其間她們最怕的就是有關於她們春情的秘密被該報披露了出來在男同學方面則這消息最表懽迎這也是必然的現象最近這資格最老的短波無線電不知爲了什麽緣故延期出版了而且它有許多新鮮的消息都被後起的曦聲壁報採訪去了即如這次復旦校董的議决案在未公佈之前學校當局是絶端守着秘密但是在曦聲壁報Ｘ期出版的</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Strictly Orders Rectification of Academic Morality Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Executive Yuan issued an order to the Ministry of Education on the 6th to rectify academic morality throughout the country, stating: "In recent years, students in our country have been seduced by communists and all reactionaries. They frequently use the pretext of improving school affairs to stage strikes and make demands, and even hold unauthorized gatherings and distribute leaflets for others to exploit. They recklessly divide into factions, leading to licentiousness and a disregard for all boundaries. The moral decline of our youth is a matter of deep sorrow. If this trend is not reversed, not only will education collapse, but there is also a danger of national subjugation and racial extinction. The government bears the responsibility for cultivating youth and rectifying discipline. At a time when academic morality is deteriorating daily, if we continue to seek a false reputation for tolerance and sit idly by as students stray onto the wrong path, without thinking of ways to restrain them, we would not only be abandoning our duty but also failing to live up to the expectations of these young people and their parents. Now that the military campaign is coming to an end, and the future of reconstruction involves myriad details, the most important task for the long term is to cultivate talent. From now on, the government's policy will be to devote all its efforts to improving education. The President of this Yuan, who also serves as head of the Executive, should exert all his energy and ability to rectify academic morality. Hereafter, all students in schools must cultivate their character, strive for knowledge, and develop into great talents. They must understand that principals are carefully selected and appointed by the government; opposing the principal is no different from opposing the government. Teachers occupy the position of mentors and protectors; students should respect and obey them, and should not base their love or hate on personal feelings or arbitrarily welcome or reject them. However, all faculty and staff should also cultivate their character and uphold moral standards to set an example for students, and devote themselves wholeheartedly to their duties to promote education. Those who are incompetent or behave despicably will be promptly dismissed and replaced by the government to restore order and satisfy public expectations. As for educational funding, which is the lifeblood of schools, the government must take responsibility for planning and ensuring that public funds are not lacking and that endowments are not shaken, so as to hinder the development of education. With these matters being the responsibility of the government and school authorities, students should focus wholeheartedly on learning, cultivate their minds and bodies, and adhere to the ancient teachings of Zisi to 'not overstep their bounds,' and uphold the Three Principles of the People of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen as their guiding principle. They must not interfere in educational administration and neglect their studies. If there are still those who willingly allow themselves to be exploited by opposition factions, acting arrogantly and exceeding their authority, the government, in order to protect youth and thoroughly rectify academic morality, will have no choice but to enforce the law strictly and punish the reactionaries, without any leniency. If weeds are not removed, good crops cannot grow. If there is a school where academic morality is extremely poor and cannot be rectified, the government will not hesitate to dissolve the entire school. For this reason, this order is hereby issued, urging the Ministry to immediately disseminate it to all levels of schools, faculty, staff, and students throughout the country, requiring them to respectfully comply with this order." (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Germany Raises Unemployment Relief Funds</h3>
<p>In recent days, countries have been resorting to raising public debt as a last resort to provide relief to the unemployed. The United States has submitted such a proposal to its parliament, and Japan has decided on it in its cabinet. According to reports from Germany, the raising of funds for unemployment relief is also being discussed. This is because the need to provide relief to the unemployed in various countries has become an urgent and unavoidable reality. People are looking to their governments to resolve this issue, but the governments have no other recourse than to resort to raising debt.</p>
<p>Although raising debt to provide unemployment relief may be used for various non-productive projects that do not further increase goods in the market, thus worsening the commercial decline, it also avoids simply providing subsidies to the unemployed, which is a waste of money. However, these so-called non-productive projects will still benefit the country, but they cannot generate profits directly in the short term. Moreover, these projects will eventually be completed, and the funds will eventually be exhausted. How can this be a long-term solution? The increase in unemployment will continue day by day, and there will be no way to effectively address the problem in the long run. Therefore, the global unemployment problem has not yet been thoroughly investigated, and a fundamental solution has not been determined. Without the joint efforts of all countries to address this issue, a truly effective result cannot be achieved. If it is seen as an accidental event and a temporary solution is sought, it will be difficult to be effective even for a short time, let alone for the long term. However, those in the world who are preoccupied with profit only know themselves and not others, only know today and not tomorrow. How can they discuss this issue?</p>

<h3>French New Cabinet Not Easily Formed for the Time Being</h3>

(2) Still a cabinet of talent, incorporating both the Radical Party and Taittinger's Party. (3) Form a Taittinger cabinet, but according to the current situation, the third option may not be feasible.</p>

<h3>German Parliament Discusses Financial Issues</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Warns the Entire House Not to Be Overly Demanding</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Asks All Parties to Quickly Conclude Discussions</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, May 5th: Today, the parliament began discussing the financial bill. Afterward, Prime Minister Brüning explained the points of several disputes one by one and warned the entire house not to be overly demanding on minor matters. He also said that the financial plan recently issued by the President's emergency order is only the initial step in organizing finances. Because the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed, and there is no way to modify it, it is handled by administrative order. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Curtius also asked all parties to quickly conclude discussions on financial issues so that a solid foundation can be established for diplomatic national policy to rely on. As for the disarmament issue, he is willing to discuss it in detail after the Geneva Preparatory Committee closes. If there are any questions at this time, he can only answer them at the secret meeting of the Diplomatic Committee. After the Prime Minister Brüning left the parliament, he immediately met with the President to report the resignation of Justice Minister Braide, because the economy has been determined to be opposed and cannot be reversed. At this time, government officials are doing their best to provide relief to the unemployed who have not received relief funds. The Prussian Cabinet, Schäffer and Hilferding, are responsible for convening Berlin business leaders today to discuss raising relief funds.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, May 5th: President Hindenburg has accepted the resignation of Justice Minister Breit. The Economic Party to which White belongs repeatedly only requested the dismissal of White because the Economic Party opposed the Brüning cabinet.</p>
<h3>I Destroys Industrial Cases</h3>
<p>Public Prosecutor States Opinion</p>
<p>Asks Judge to Sentence All Eight Defendants to Death</p>
<p>National Society, Moscow, May 5th: After the secret interrogation of the "Destruction of Industry" case (K) and (R), the truth of the two legal institutions was revealed, and the court was opened to the public. The public prosecutor stated his opinion, saying that the air was very tense during the ten days of the case. Not only those in Soviet Russia who deliberately destroyed it, but also the entire European middle class were extremely concerned about the case. Their newspapers were full of malicious rumors and fabricated news such as peasant uprisings in Soviet Russia in order to confuse the world. Compared with the Shakhty case two and a half years ago, the scope of the destruction was wider and the organization was more complete. Our country has only now united with the counter-revolutionary army as its current enemy. The middle-class countries are suffering from economic collapse and seeing the Soviet Union's growing consolidation, so they deliberately caused a new war, hoping to break the predicament. Unfortunately, when their intervention plan was about to be realized, it was discovered by us, so their newspapers were uneasy and full of rumors. In fact, our country has always adhered to a peaceful policy and only focused on the realization of socialism. As for the importance of this case, it can be observed from two points: whether the country's external security and socialist construction work can continue peacefully. Then, the details of the case were discussed, saying that the defendant's confession was the most important evidence in the case. If it is said that it was forced confession, it is an unreasonable statement. Then, the relationship between the defendant and foreign countries was discussed, pointing out that the denial declaration issued by the Industrial and Commercial Committee was still not enough to conceal the evidence of its meeting with former French Prime Minister Poincaré. This move is politically important and cannot be ignored. Moreover, Lai Muxun's statement that a special intervention committee was established in the French General Staff also has no reason to be unbelievable. Finally, the judge was asked to sentence all eight defendants to death.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, May 6th: The official news agency is now broadcasting the confessions of the eight defendants, the defense arguments of the defense lawyers, and the prosecutor's declaration to the world regarding the case of destroying Soviet industry. It is said that the defendants all claimed that they were willing to sincerely repent and begged for their death to be spared, willing to be loyal to the government to atone for their past sins.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chengjia, May 6th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Russia's Kazakhstan has ordered the convening of special cavalry teams of the Youth Communist Party organization to search for miners and laborers on the Turksestan-Siberia Railway and resolve the case for interrogation. It is said that these workers participated in the conspiracy to destroy the newly built railway. It was found that this route was officially opened in May, but scheduled passenger cars have not yet been opened. Several sections of the roadbed have already been damaged.</p>
<h3>Dark Currents of Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>Prime Minister's Agency Problem</p>
<p>Hamaguchi's Treatment Progressing Smoothly</p>
<p>Electricity Agency, Tokyo, May 6th: Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition has been good recently, whether he can withstand the parliamentary duties is a problem. With the parliament meeting approaching, there is talk of Finance Minister Kiyoura resigning as Prime Minister's agent, so the problem of Prime Minister's agent has arisen again. Those who support Interior Minister Adachi say that this is the original intention of the party cabinet. Others in the palace support Land Minister Ugaki, and the Finance Minister Emoto faction is also active in the meantime. Government and party cadres believe that any mistake will affect the party's situation, so they are very cautious. They plan to wait for the two ministers, Adachi and Emoto, to return to Beijing and hold a meeting of party-born cabinet members and party cadres on the 8th and 9th to exchange opinions frankly. Moreover, with the parliament meeting approaching, there are also problems with the selection and decision of party officials in the parliament. Depending on the situation of Prime Minister Hamaguchi in the next ten days, there may be disturbances within the party.</p>
<p>Electricity Agency, Tokyo, May 6th: Although Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition has not recovered as quickly as expected, it can be considered to be progressing smoothly and is on the road to recovery. However, because the political season is approaching, there are various rumors about the Prime Minister's condition. Dr. Shiota and Professor Manabe jointly announced the condition book at 7:00 last night as follows: Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition was deeply feared to develop suppurative peritonitis two or three days after the operation. Fortunately, this crisis has also passed uneventfully. The outside of the intestine is also reliably organized, the amount of food intake is increasing daily, and digestion is also good. The wound is shrinking smoothly, and there is no danger of causing any obstacles in the wound in the future. There is no need to forcibly remove the bullet. Recently, the body temperature has not exceeded 27 degrees, and the breathing pulse is also normal. Physical strength is increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Paris Morning Post's Editorial Criticism of the International Arbitration Treaty</h3>
<p>Only Eight Countries Have Formally Joined in Two Years</p>
<p>Important Disputes Are All Excluded from the Scope of Arbitration</p>
<p>World Society Translation Paris Morning Post Editor-in-Chief Lao Changnai recently wrote an article saying that arbitration, security, and disarmament are the three cornerstones of the future temple of peace. Regarding this level, everyone in Geneva agrees, but everyone has different opinions on the order in which these three cornerstones should be laid. Finally, Lord Cecil proposed that these three stones be placed in the soil at the same time.</p>
<p>I do not want to be influenced by this controversy, but I want to point out the current position of one of the three cornerstones, that is, the stone of arbitration, which is the main cornerstone of the temple of peace and the one that causes the least difficulty in the controversy. An expert in Geneva recently told me that (for a doctrine as fair and simple as international arbitration, the result of two years of discussion by thirty or forty countries is only this, which is really disappointing. This is like a ball losing its roundness due to excessive transportation.)</p>
<p>International arbitration is undoubtedly one of the fairest and simplest doctrines in the world. There is no doubt that where there are humans, there are disputes, so there must be an arbitration court to resolve all disputes between humans. On this point, all participants in international conferences agree. However, when it comes to writing this agreement in black ink on white paper, a kind of evil wind blows around the drafters, so that the drafters' pens are incompatible with words, and the words are incompatible with meaning. Everyone sees this as a huge object, and everyone wants to participate in its creation, so the contention arises again.</p>
<p>The so-called (General Treaty for the Resolution of International Disputes by Arbitration) has encountered the above situation in Geneva. After some intermittent discussions on the treaty, Sweden suddenly proposed that judicial disputes and political disputes should be distinguished. Disputes are disputes, so why should some disputes be excluded from the scope of disputes? It is incomprehensible to ordinary people. Do some disputes not contain the same crisis that can lead to war?</p>
<p>Therefore, Sweden proposed that judicial disputes be referred to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and political disputes be referred to a special conciliation committee, and the administrative council of the League of Nations has the final power of judgment. Among the countries, such as Britain, enthusiastically supported the division of judicial disputes and political disputes into two categories, and other countries suggested two classifications and then set exceptions. After two years of revision and revision, this (General Treaty for the Resolution of International Disputes by Arbitration) was officially released in June 1928. The treaty has 47 articles divided into four chapters. Its content is a mixture of regulations and procedures. However, in this mixture, one thing is extremely clear, that is, Article 39 stipulates that all countries can avoid arbitration by the following excuses: A. Disputes arising before joining the General Treaty are not arbitrated. B. Disputes concerning matters of exclusive national judgment allowed by international public law are not arbitrated. C. Disputes concerning special events such as territorial law are not arbitrated. Alas, at this point, the general public will again call out to the sky and ask, since the above three items of disputes have been excluded from the scope of arbitration, what disputes are left out for arbitration?</p>
<p>However, this is not the worst. The worst thing is that this kind of troublesome discussion and careful drafting of the (General Treaty for the Resolution of International Disputes by Arbitration) is actually ignored by the people and governments of the world. Readers, you also know those forty countries that call themselves members of the League of Nations and publish peace theories every year. How many countries have formally notified the League of Nations Secretariat that they have complied with the General Arbitration Treaty? In fact, there are only eight countries, namely Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Finland, Luxembourg, and Spain. France is about to join without a doubt because the French lower house has unanimously resolved to order the government to join the treaty, and the upper house will only approve it sooner or later. As such, after two years of strong time, only nine countries have recognized arbitration to resolve disputes, while Britain and its colonies, as well as Germany, Italy, and Hungary, and the countries that are loudly advocating immediate disarmament, have not yet joined the ranks of approval.</p>
<p>At this point, we can assert that international arbitration has made very slow progress in the past two years. Assuming that this is one of the cornerstones of the temple of peace, it is an extremely unstable cornerstone that can only be used to build a paper house on it.</p>

The first guard train arrived at the station at 6:00 a.m., led by Liu Duoquan, the commander. At 7:50 a.m., Zhang's special train entered the station, and military music played loudly. Han and others paid their respects to Zhang, who had not woken up from his sleep and had not had time to meet them. Then, at 8:35 a.m., the train started and headed north. The train had 18 cars, and Zhang was in the sleeper car on the 8th. One of Beining Road's No. 163 locomotives and Jinpu Road's No. 262 locomotives were used to tow it back and forth. The third staff train entered the station at 8:00 a.m., and He Fenglin and others rode on it. The first and third trains were still on the special train, one after the other. Along the way, armored vehicles patrolled. The Great Wall armored vehicle stopped at Xuzhou Station and opened the road north to Linli before the special train entered the station. Then, the Beiping armored vehicle took over the road from Lincheng to Jinan. The patrol along the way was very strict (5th).</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Arrives in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Yan Xishan's resignation and going abroad is a major key to cleaning up the situation in the North. It is heard that Yan has come to Tianjin in disguise on the 30th of last month, and his departure abroad will not be far off. The details of his departure from Shanxi to Tianjin are what outsiders want to know. The following is what I learned from the interview:</p>
<p>Wang Shuchang, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, received a telegram from Shang Zhen a few days ago saying that Yan had decided to come to Tianjin to go abroad. Wang immediately sent his Chief of Staff Chen Qinruo to meet with Chen Guanqun, Chief of Staff of Yu Xuezhong, and personally led a special train to Shijiazhuang to welcome Yan. They arrived in Shi on the 30th and wired to discuss the connection. Shang sent An Bingyi, the head of the security regiment of the headquarters, to Shi with a letter from Shang to pay respects to Chen and others, saying that Yan had set off on the 29th to avoid welcome parties, transferred to Datong and took the Ping Sui Road to Tianjin, and specially sent Regiment Commander An to Shi to express his gratitude. Chen and others met with An and then returned to Tianjin. The press in Beijing and Tianjin paid close attention to Yan's whereabouts and asked Chen about the truth. Chen said that Yan had probably arrived in Tianjin. I went to visit Yan's relatives and friends in Tianjin. As a result, I got the exact news of Yan's arrival in Tianjin from Bo Yizhong, the director of the former Tianjin Mint (Bo is Yan's brother-in-law). Bo introduced me to meet Yan. I asked Mr. what his plans were. Yan replied that he would rest in Tianjin for a while and then travel abroad. He had not yet decided which country to go to first. I asked who had been entrusted with the military and political affairs of Shanxi and what the current situation was. Yan replied that the political affairs were originally managed by Shang Zhen, and the military affairs were now managed by Shang and Xu Yongchang. After I (Yan called himself) left, they would still be maintained by the two of them. I asked about Mr. Feng Yuxiang's whereabouts. Yan replied that Mr. Feng had sent someone to him two weeks ago, saying that he had also decided to travel abroad, but he wanted to choose another route. After that, he did not communicate and it was difficult to answer where he was now. Finally, Yan said that he was in a position of resigning and it was inconvenient to publish too much. However, since returning to Wutai, he felt relieved and his mind was very comfortable. He originally intended not to see guests in Tianjin, but he met you so that all parties would know that I had left Shanxi and came here to avoid national doubts. I said goodbye and left. It is heard that Yan took a car from his original residence in Wutai to Datong, stayed there for one night, and the next morning, he took the third-class passenger car of the Ping Sui Road to Beijing in disguise. Before reaching the Xizhimen Station, he got off at Tsinghua Garden and took a car to Fengtai to take the night train of the Beining Road to Tianjin. He got off the train at 11 p.m. and first rested in a hotel in the Japanese Concession, then went to Bo Yizhong's house in the British Concession. He knocked on the door for a long time in the late night before the owner came out and realized that it was Yan. After that, he stayed at Bo's house. The matter was so secret that it was extremely difficult for outsiders to know. He only brought two attendants with him. His family members and Zhao Daiwen and Ji Gongquan, who were traveling with him, had not yet arrived. The purpose of Yan's trip is to travel to Europe via Japan (December 4th).</p>
<h3>Question of Establishing Customs in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Opinions of the Guangdong Customs Superintendent</p>
<p>Smuggling of goods along the coast of Hong Kong is becoming increasingly rampant, resulting in a significant loss of national tax revenue. In order to prevent tax evasion, the Ministry of Finance instructed the Inspector General of Customs to go to Hong Kong to negotiate the establishment of a customs office there to prevent smuggling. A draft agreement has been negotiated and completed. It is reported that Weng Guiqing, the Guangdong Customs Superintendent, sent a telegram to the ministry yesterday, expressing strong support for this agreement and emphasizing that smuggling in the south is increasing daily, and establishing a customs office as soon as possible is necessary to prevent it. The telegram is recorded as follows: (It has been examined that the draft agreement for the establishment of a customs office in Hong Kong was submitted to the Ministry for review, and all clauses seem fair and reasonable. The Hong Kong side benefits greatly from the principle in Clause 16, which aims to provide convenience to merchants and promote the commercial and economic development of the port. However, in Item A of that clause, Chinese goods imported from Chinese treaty ports into Hong Kong or re-exported to China from the same or other treaty ports are exempt from import duties, provided they are in their original packaging and have not been altered. However, they may also apply to the Chinese customs for permission to repack. If the repackaging process is not closely monitored by personnel, there is a risk of abuse. In Item B, the period for which import duties paid on foreign goods imported into China can be refunded when re-exported from Hong Kong within three years seems too long. I have discussed this with you in person before, and recently the Inspector General of Customs came to the provincial capital to meet with me. I also suggested that these two points should be considered further. I was then informed that an agreement had been reached with the Hong Kong government to allow the establishment of customs warehouses in Hong Kong, managed by the Chinese customs. Goods stored in the warehouses would be sealed by the customs for all entry and exit, and repackaging could be inspected at any time, eliminating any concerns. If this is implemented, it will be more complete. According to current investigations, nearly one-third of smuggled goods are in southern China. After the new tax is implemented, smuggling will inevitably increase. It seems that this agreement should be approved and a customs office established as soon as possible to remedy the situation. If it is not yet perfect, a trial period of one year can be set, after which the agreement can be revised to allow for adjustments. I hope you will consider and implement this. Furthermore, I would like to state that the customs office is responsible for managing the inspection of goods entering and exiting several provinces in South China, and this is a very important responsibility. Especially in the initial stages, it is necessary to appoint special, honest, and competent Chinese and foreign personnel to handle the work in order to achieve effective results and prevent corruption. I hope that you will be able to see through this. After the establishment of a customs office in Hong Kong, Chinese and foreign smugglers will inevitably change their methods and use a large number of smaller ships to transport goods and smuggle them into the mainland through other ports, such as Guangzhou Bay, Taiwan, and Macau. It is necessary to continue to carry out inspections or establish customs offices in these ports, or dispatch patrol boats to investigate and crack down on smuggling, in order to achieve comprehensive control. Otherwise, if we only focus on one area and neglect others, we will still not be able to achieve the desired results. This is my humble opinion, and I hope you will consider it. Submitted by your subordinate, Weng Guiqing.)</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Wuzhou Air Transport Scheduled to Open This Month</h3>
<p>One Round Trip Between Guangdong and Wuzhou on the First Day</p>
<p>Groups are Welcome to Ride During the Trial Flight</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to recent military relations, the Guangdong-Wuzhou air transport has been operating frequently. The authorities are taking this opportunity to simultaneously run civil aviation and have assigned one or two aircraft to fly between Guangzhou and Wuzhou daily for business purposes. The transportation will be limited to mail, newspapers, and passengers. The opening ceremony was held on the first of this month. Beforehand, a shed was built as a platform at the Dashatou Aviation Office airfield, and the civil aircraft "Qujiang" and the military aircraft "Nanxiong" were designated as the operating aircraft. Those from the military and political circles who attended on that day included Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, Du Yiqian, the director of the headquarters rear area, and over a hundred guests of both genders from all walks of life. After Chen inspected the Aviation Office and the Aviation School, he went to the platform to attend the opening ceremony of the civil aviation. After Chen, who was the chairman, performed the ceremony, Chen gave a speech, stating that air transportation is more economical and faster than water transportation. China is an economically backward country and should vigorously promote civil aviation. He deeply admired that his fellow aviation comrades in Guangdong were aware of the urgent need to implement civil aviation. He hoped to gradually develop it and eventually achieve the goal of aviation to save the country advocated by the late leader Sun Yat-sen. He also hoped that all sectors of the public would work together. After everyone gave their speeches, they walked out to the airfield. It was already 9:55. The two aircraft were then prepared for departure. This was the first trial flight and was not yet open to the public. Only members of various public organizations were invited to ride. The "Qujiang" was piloted by Xie Mang, and the "Nanxiong" was piloted by Tan Shou. The former aircraft carried several newspaper reporters, while the latter carried three representatives of organizations. At 9:20, the two aircraft took off simultaneously, circled once in the air, and then headed west. The people in the airfield returned to the Aviation Office hall for refreshments after the two aircraft had gone far away. In the afternoon, a telegram came from Wuzhou stating that the two aircraft arrived in Wuzhou at 11:32 in the morning. They did not stop along the way and only dropped the attached printed materials from the air when passing through Sanshui and Zhaoqing. After arriving in Wuzhou, the "Nanxiong" aircraft was assigned a military task and did not return to Guangzhou that day. Only the "Qujiang" aircraft returned from Wuzhou to Guangzhou at 2:30 in the afternoon and landed at the Dashatou airfield at around 3:00 (One night).</p>
<h3>Rampant Activities of Korean Communists in Yanbian</h3>
<p>Tragic Case of Burning Down Yanji County School and Burning an Entire Family to Death</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: There are tens of thousands of Koreans living in Yanbian. Among them, some of the lower-class elements have become increasingly depraved, leading to the rampant activities of Korean communists in the area. Despite repeated earnest warnings from the Jilin Provincial Government, there has been little improvement. On the 18th of last month, the 29th County-Run School in Liushuhezi, Chongli Township, Yanji County, was burned down by communist bandits, resulting in the tragic death of many people. Upon receiving the report, the County Education Bureau immediately forwarded it to the County Government, ordering the police to block and suppress the bandits. At the same time, they telegraphed Zhao Yuling, the principal of the Ninth School, to investigate and report the details. According to the reply, it was confirmed that at 12:00 PM on November 18, more than 20 communist bandits suddenly arrived at Liushuhezi and surrounded the 29th County-Run School. They poured cotton and straw with coal oil and set fires on all four sides. In an instant, the fire spread rapidly, and all nine school buildings were reduced to ashes. A total of five people were burned to death, including the principal, Li Houye, his wife, Wang, a one-year-old child, and a three-year-old child. In addition, Li Hougui, the principal's uncle, who was visiting the school, was also burned to death. A school employee named Hou Yuankai managed to escape from the fire. He went to the home of a farmer named Li in the nearby village and asked for a cotton quilt to cover his body before leaving the village. His whereabouts are unknown. Teacher Zheng Bingshi and his younger brother, Zheng Bingzhi, managed to escape with only their hair burned. His wife crawled out of the fire, but her head was struck with a hole in her left forehead by bandits, causing severe bleeding. Her condition is critical. Currently, there are five corpses in the school, with charred heads, broken legs, and broken arms, covered with hemp cloth and guarded by the village chief, Xuan Jiyi. Zheng's wife was carried to a neighbor's house.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>To provide medical treatment. The above situation was that the principal, after receiving a telegram from the bureau chief early in the morning on the 19th, accompanied by soldiers and police, went to the school to verify the situation. All the information obtained was factual and without any falsehoods. After the principal arrived at the school, he inquired with teacher Zheng, who stated that at 12:00 PM last night, the fire started. His wife woke him up and dragged him up. He was staying in the western room of the main house, while the principal and his family were staying in the eastern room. The school employee and Li Hougui were staying in the middle room. It happened that Li Hou was about to go out through the front door when he was struck back by the bandits with wooden sticks. Hou then lifted the pot and sat in the stove pit, covering his head with the pot to avoid the fire. He hid behind the stove pit. At this time, the front door and back window were surrounded by bandits. After a while, the bandits gathered behind the house. He took the opportunity to escape from the front window to the west neighbor's house and asked for help. After the neighbors arrived, the bandits had already left. As for how the school employee Hou Yuankai and his wife and brother escaped, he did not know. He also inquired with Qu Yonglin, a west neighbor, who stated that he heard shouts from the school last night, followed by groans. Then he saw the fire and knew that it was a communist disturbance. He had no weapons and dared not go to the rescue. He fled to the back mountain to take refuge. When he went out, he saw four or five bandits with white upper bodies and blue lower bodies. He could see them clearly because of the firelight. He only returned at 10:00 PM this afternoon. He could not provide further details. An investigation found that the principal's body was found crawling out of the front window of the eastern room of the main house. His left leg and both arms were broken, and his head was half-burned. It was speculated that he must have tried to jump out of the window but was struck with broken arms by the bandits. Then, the fire burned fiercely, and he died lying on the window. The wind was strong outside the window, and the fire was blown inward by the wind, so his hair was not completely burned. His left leg was broken, perhaps because it was crushed by falling beams. After the bandits left, several leaflets were posted on the school wall, pasted with potato paste. They were all torn down by the principal and are now attached. The tragic death of the principal's family is truly pitiful. The family is poor and cannot afford coffins. It is hoped that you will consider his hard work and achievements, and pity the tragedy of his death, and provide more compensation to ensure a decent burial for his entire family so that they can rest in peace. The Education Bureau believes that the case is serious. The school teacher Zheng Bingshi, his wife and brother Zheng Bingzhi, the school employee Hou Yuankai, the village chief Xuan Jiyi, and the residents near the school should all be interrogated to thoroughly investigate the matter. Also, since the school is only fifteen miles away from Wengsheng Town and Tiaotiaogou, the flames at night must have been clearly visible from Weng and Tea. However, the police, who are responsible for suppressing communist bandits and protecting the school, not only did not send police at the time but also did not inquire about the matter afterward. Their negligence is shocking. A special request is made to the County Government to first remove and punish the police leaders responsible for Weng and Tea, and at the same time, provide generous compensation to the bereaved family of the principal who died in the disaster. The Provincial Government yesterday received a report from Sun, the County Magistrate of the county, and has already telegraphed the Yanji Police Department through the Police Department, ordering them to arrest the perpetrators of the case within a limited time and to take strict precautions (December 1st).</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Murder Case of Judge Ha</h3>
<p>Zhang Liqing's Condition Gradually Improving</p>
<p>Ye Yixiong Detained in the Detention Center</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: In the case of Judge Ye Yixiong's murder for financial gain, the victim Zhang Liqing (Lizhen was her original name) is now able to eat. However, she has a habit of smoking opium, so complete recovery still needs to wait. The Central Hospital only allows relatives and friends to visit on Thursdays and Sundays, and refuses visits on other days. On November 30, a reporter visited Zhang at the hospital and asked her about the attack and her acquaintance with Ye. The questions and answers were as follows: (Q) When and where did you meet Mr. Ye Yixiong? (A) Last year, on Double Ten Day, I was returning from Harbin to Ping Lengyun (Ye Yixiong's courtesy name) was also going to Changchun from Harbin. We met in the second-class carriage. He got off the train in Changchun, and I returned to Beiping. (Q) Did you two correspond with each other afterward? (A) Lengyun wrote to me first, but I ignored him. He wrote to me twice more, and then I started corresponding with him. (Q) When did you come to Harbin from Beiping again? (A) About in February last year. (Q) Where did you live? (A) At a friend's house. (Q) Did you have contact with Ye? (A) Yes, but not often. (Q) When did you move to the Beijing Hotel and why did you move there? (A) About in early May, because it was not appropriate to stay at a friend's house for too long, so I moved out. (Q) Did you see Ye often at the hotel? (A) Yes, often. (Q) Why did you move to the Barras Hotel and when did you move there? (A) Because the rooms at the Barras Hotel were larger and the indoor air was better. There was also a bathroom, so I could take a bath every day and feel more comfortable. I moved there around the beginning of August. (Q) Did you go with Ye when you remitted 7,050 yuan in cash from the Bank of Communications? (A) Lengyun went alone. I used to handle deposits and withdrawals at the Bank of Communications here myself, but sometimes I asked him to do it for me. (Q) Do you remember the date? (A) About two days before I left. (Q) Who kept the seal and the remittance slip before you left? (A) He took the seal away on the day of the withdrawal and never returned it. As for the remittance slip, he also said that it would be safer for him to keep it. I did not object, so he took it with him. (Q) Did Ye accompany you to Beiping or just send you to Changchun? (A) We went to Beiping together. (Q) Did you have any arguments in the car before arriving at Shuangcheng? (A) No. (Q) What else happened before arriving at Shuangcheng Station? (A) At that time, we were sitting in the second-class carriage. He asked me for the key to open my suitcase to take out his pants to change. In fact, he did not have any pants in my suitcase. Now I understand that he was just using this as an excuse to trick me out of my key. I probably had eight or nine keys. The keys to my suitcase at my home in Beiping were also inside. (Q) What was Ye's attitude like before arriving at Shuangcheng Station? (A) He looked flustered and very unnatural. I even joked and said, "Lengyun, what's wrong? Why are you so flustered and look so bad? Are you going to die?" (Q) Besides the 7,050 yuan remittance slip, did Ye know that you had other money? (A) Now I understand that I was unintentional, but he was intentional. He had already asked me how much money I had (about 20,000 yuan deposited somewhere), and he was very attentive to the date when the interest was due. (Q) How did he trick you into getting off the train when you arrived at Shuang Station? (A) He said that there was a very nice place in Shuangcheng that I had to see. The express train only stops for ten minutes, but this is a slow train and will stop for sixty minutes. I didn't want to get off the train, but he forced me to get off. So I put on my coat and got off with him. Because the road was slippery, he held my arm to help me walk. We walked west and then turned north. Suddenly, he tripped me and shot me in the back. I knew I was attacked. Although I felt very painful, I didn't dare to groan for fear that he would fire two more shots. After shooting, he turned around to look at me, but he believed that I was dead. (Q) How were you rescued? (A) After a short while, someone was walking with a lantern. I shouted for help. The person wanted to report to the police at the station first and then come back to carry me. I was afraid that Ye would harm me again, so I asked him to help me. I also reluctantly endured the pain and walked. (Q) Why did you get off the train with Ye and walk west of the railway? Weren't you afraid that Ye had ulterior motives? (A) It's easy to know a person's face but not their heart. I never thought that he was a prosecutor who knew the law but broke it and dared to plot for money and kill people. He is truly a disgrace to the judiciary. (Q) What is your attitude towards Ye now? (A) I treated him well. Now, as far as I am concerned, I am already dead. My survival is my good fortune. I heard that the court is still investigating and has not yet made a judgment. If the court is lenient, I will hire a lawyer to appeal to the high court after I am discharged from the hospital. (Q) It is rumored that you have a lover in Beiping. Is that true? What is his name? (A) It is true that I have another friend named Liu Dingshu, but I will not tell you his name. (Q) Does Ye know about him? (A) Yes, he knows.</p>
<p>As for Ye Yixiong, he was sent to the Binjiang District Court on the 26th. The court has held two hearings in the past week. Ye's testimony is the same as before. He still does not admit to the murder. The court sent prosecutors to the Central Hospital twice to record Zhang Liqing's testimony. Due to medical restrictions, the actual testimony has not yet been recorded. The Northeast Supreme Court has sent personnel to Harbin to investigate the truth. It is possible that he will be transferred to the Shenyang District Court for trial to avoid collusion at the same level. Ye is still being held in the detention center after entering the Daowai Court (1st).</p>

<p>Fengxian</p>
<p>The Salt Transport Deputy’s Suppression of Salty and Adulterated Salt: The coastal residents of this county mostly rely on salt production for a living. Each household owns salt pans and purchases salt from factories by the catty for their livelihood. However, the weighers at the salt factories routinely demand petty fees from the salt producers when they deliver salt to the factory. Otherwise, they suppress the weight, reporting less than the actual amount, even deducting half. The difference can be several times the amount. Even if customary fees are paid, they still suppress two or three catties as "scale residue." If the shortage is not made up, not only is it deducted from the salt price and compensation pursued, but they also falsely accuse the salt producers of private sales, arresting and fining them. The salt producers’ grievances are hard to express, and they all complain bitterly. Therefore, representatives were once sent to petition the county party headquarters, calling for action. Consequently, the headquarters, in conjunction with the party headquarters of coastal counties, requested the province to forward a report to the salt authorities, urging strict suppression, which was recorded. It is now known that the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy and the Audit Office have received a clear order to investigate and prohibit these practices, and four improvement measures have been formulated for salt deliveries to factories and distributed for compliance. Furthermore, the Transport Office has also ordered Qing Yuan and other salt yards to strictly suppress the long-standing malpractice of adulteration during salt delivery by salt producers. If such situations are discovered, the factories are authorized to detain and confiscate the salt.</p>

<p>Labor Strike in Wuxi Silk Factories Gradually Calming Down: After the labor strike broke out in silk factories throughout the county, it has been four days, causing significant losses to the factory owners and much suffering to the laborers. A small number of troublemakers are truly guilty of unforgivable crimes. Various agencies, including the Party, government, and labor unions, have made every effort to mediate, and the situation has shown signs of easing. It is hoped that this will bring about a peaceful resolution. Yesterday (the 6th), silk factories in the Zhoushanbang area, such as Qianfeng, Ruichang, Yuanfeng, Yuanyi, and those near the Gongyun Bridge, such as Gansheng and Gantai, as well as Jinji in Ximen, all sounded the siren and resumed work as usual. All the female workers entered the factories to work. Outside Nanmen, except for Minfeng Model Silk Factory, which has never been drawn into the vortex and has continued to operate as usual, other factories, such as Yulun, also resumed work yesterday morning and were operating safely. However, factories such as Yongtai and Zhenyi have not yet resumed work. It is expected that factories outside Dongmen, such as Yufeng, will also resume work across the board today. In addition, the Provincial Party Headquarters dispatched Commissioner Sun Dan Chen to Wuxi to investigate and handle the labor strike as circumstances permit. After arriving in Wuxi, Commissioner Sun immediately discussed everything with the various members of the County Party Headquarters, as well as County Magistrate Pan and the members of the Labor Consolidation Association, regarding the strict punishment and thorough investigation of the few labor thugs who incited the strike in order to maintain the labor movement.</p>

They also seized a large amount of opium and red pills and brought them to the bureau. It is unknown how, but later, through the mediation of Sheng Agou, an investigating police officer of the bureau, each opium offender paid 50 yuan to settle the matter. This was discovered by local residents Wang Zixian and Li Zhongying, who believed that Xun Dexing, the chief of the sub-bureau, had illegally released the opium offenders by bribery.

The day before yesterday, Guo and others discovered the flaw and realized they had been cheated. They immediately rushed to Xu Hongyu's home for serious negotiations.

It is heard that the first kidnapped person, the traditional Chinese medicine doctor Zhang Chengqi, was being held for a ransom of 4,000 yuan. Because the Zhang family does not have the funds, he has not yet been released. It is said that Zhang is being tortured in the robber's den. As for the second kidnapping, Zou Youying and four others, the robbers are demanding a total of 30,000 yuan. Helplessly, these people are all dirt poor. After the hostages pleaded bitterly to the robber chief, he said he would reduce the price after conducting his own investigation. The day before yesterday, a large number of robbers disguised as vegetable sellers hired a boat to Jin Village to peddle their goods. However, the boat did not carry many cabbages. When they were buying and selling with people, they mentioned the current situation of the Wu family and other families, speaking of the kidnapping by robbers in a pitiful manner. Before long, the townspeople saw through their disguise and knew that they were not good people. They did not dare to talk to them. Within two days, the boat sailed into the sea.</p>

<p>Aboard a Robbed Passenger Boat, Victim Dies Tragically: Pan Biliang, a grain merchant from Yitaiyuan Lu Chenhang outside the south gate of this city, loaded a boat with rice to sell at the Lu Chenhang. Yesterday (the 3rd) morning, after receiving the price, he took the original boat to Jiangba Town under the jurisdiction of Xuyi County to purchase miscellaneous grains. En route, when he arrived at Qiaojiajian in Huxi, he suddenly encountered a ship. Seven bandits suddenly appeared, each holding a gun, shouting to stop the boat. They swarmed onto the boat and immediately tied up Pan Biliang, stabbing him in the neck with a sharp blade, causing him to fall to the ground and die. They then dragged his son, Hongchun, out of the cabin and shot him to death. Subsequently, they searched the boat and stole 739 silver dollars, a self-defense pistol, and dozens of bolts of white cloth. His nephew, Pan Youhua, and the wife of the deceased have reported the incident to the county government, requesting a strict investigation. An absconded Provincial Public Security Team Captain: Pengfei, the captain of the 23rd Team of the 6th District of the Provincial Public Security Team stationed at the Fairy Temple, was reported to have uncovered a large-scale earthmoving operation established by the Yu family in Tangtou Town, Yangzhou in August of this year, and privately fined them a large sum of money. Subsequently, Xu Zijin, Zhou Zicheng, and Xu Chaoshan, merchants and farmers from Yangzhou, filed a complaint with the Civil Affairs Department. The department then ordered the 6th District Department stationed in the post office to investigate and reply. The department then ordered Pengfei to be dismissed and placed under surveillance. Fearing punishment, he abandoned his post and fled. The district chief has repeatedly sent detectives to investigate, but to no avail. It is now heard that in addition to ordering the confiscation of the share capital of the Jiangsu Grand Hotel, which Le Zai had jointly invested in Zhenjiang, the Civil Affairs Department has also issued a notice to all counties to strictly pursue him.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Yangzhong County Intercepts Construction Public Funds: Recently, citizens of Yangzhong County reported that County Magistrate Xu had intercepted and misappropriated construction public funds. The Construction Department sent the Construction Bureau Chief of Zhenjiang County to investigate. Yesterday, Chief Zhang returned to the province and found five instances of the county magistrate's interception: (1) When the county magistrate also served as the Finance Bureau Chief, tax collectors were short more than 1,800 yuan. Although the tax collectors Wang Zhaohong and Zhang Lijian have fully paid back the debt and redeemed the guarantee, the county magistrate has not turned over a single cent to the Construction Bureau for safekeeping. (2) The former Finance Bureau handed over the supplementary payments from tax collectors for various regular and special taxes in the 18th year of the Republic to the relevant parties for collection. However, more than 1,000 yuan in land tax for road construction was also intercepted. (3) The county magistrate misappropriated more than 1,490 yuan in special construction funds for administrative expenses and planned to repay the funds from the provincial tax revenue, starting in June, with priority given to repayment in the 19th year. However, the county has not allocated any funds since the collection began in May, which is hindering credibility. (4) The county's Finance Bureau was abolished and merged into the county government's Finance Section seven months ago, but there has been no regular accounting since then. As a result, the construction land tax of more than 1,000 yuan from the Lesheng Baojin Two Islands is impossible to investigate and collect, and more than 1,000 yuan in rent from the Lesheng Sancheng Island, which is a special fund for repairing the river embankment, is also difficult to investigate and collect. (5) The county magistrate ignored the Construction Department's important policies, and is suspected of ineffective collection of construction land tax in the 17th year of the Republic, which was supplemented this year. In addition, the collected funds are not being allocated.</p>
<p>In the Jiajia Lane Robbery Case, Both the Robbers and Goods Were Recovered: There was a robbery at Xia Liu's house at No. 44 Jiajia Lane the day before yesterday, resulting in the loss of silver dollars, clothing, ornaments, and miscellaneous items. At around 5:00 PM yesterday, detectives from the Public Security Bureau found three suspicious individuals at No. 12 Paiwantou Lane and immediately arrested them and brought them back for interrogation. One, Chen Lunyuan, 25 years old, from Suqian; one, Chen Niansen, 26 years old, from Hebei; and one, Wang Yuting, 39 years old, from Suqian, all confessed to robbing Xia Liu's house in Jiajia Lane. Most of the clothing and jewelry have now been recovered.</p>
<p>Proposed Reform of Consumption Tax: The Ministry of Finance previously established various special tax bureaus in the provinces as a preparation for abolishing likin. However, after a good is declared for tax, it can only circulate in one province, and it must be declared again in another province. The ministry is now preparing to reform the special consumption tax because the national government has explicitly ordered the abolition of likin on January 1. It has sent special personnel to investigate the provinces in order to start the reform. Jiang Chengsheng, the investigator sent by the Ministry of Finance to Jiangsu Province, arrived in the province yesterday and is scheduled to convene silk factories, lumber industries, oil industries, tea industries, pottery industries, and paper industries to speak today. It is heard that after the abolition of likin, it will still be difficult for taxed goods to circulate throughout the country. It is planned to first designate the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei as a free circulation area and gradually expand it.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Division Commander Wei Comes to Yangzhou for Inspection: Wei Lihuang, commander of the 45th Division, came to Yangzhou today (the 5th). It is heard that he plans to inspect the 265th Regiment in Yangzhou at the Sheng Yang Middle School drill field by the Yangtze River tomorrow morning, and the 266th Regiment in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Verdict Announced in the Yanghuo Road Disaster Case: The Public Security Bureau's police force successively apprehended five suspects in connection with the worker riot that occurred in March of this year on Yanghuo Road in this county, in which construction bureau officials were beaten and injured. The suspects, Xia Guohuai, Xie Zhengfu, Shi Youfa, Xia Shaotang, and Wang Changsen, were sent to the court, which has held two hearings. It is now known that a verdict was announced yesterday (the 4th), and Xia Guohuai and the others were all acquitted.</p>
<p>Jiaxing</p>
<p>Notorious Opium Dealer Captured: Xiao Abing, a notorious opium dealer in Jiaxing, has repeatedly been hunted down by government officials, but always slipped through the net. Last year, after the county public security bureau seized a large amount of opium from him, they requested a warrant for his arrest. Recently, as the crackdown eased, Xiao secretly returned to Jiaxing to resume his old business. On the night of the 5th, someone informed the local court, and a prosecutor led police to capture Xiao and seize more than two liang of opium. Xiao was immediately taken to the court and placed in custody.</p>
<p>Huzhou</p>
<p>Series of Robberies in Minjiakan: Min Maosong, a farmer from Minjiakan, a place about ten li outside the Xiaodongmen in Changxing, Huzhou, lived a simple life, barely making ends meet. On the night of the 3rd, at about 10:00 PM, more than a dozen gangsters suddenly arrived, speaking in a Hakka accent and armed with guns. They broke down the door and robbed the house, taking all the clothes and silver. The gangsters then went to the neighboring Min family and rummaged through boxes and cabinets, searching at will. The losses of the two families amounted to more than 400 yuan. Court Courier Meets Thieves En Route: Shen Shigan, a court courier from the Wuxing branch in this city, took a boat to Ling on the 2nd to deliver official documents to the countryside. While passing through the Chefuyang area, he suddenly encountered a pirate ship. Two bandits shouted to stop the oars. The two bandits boarded the boat, threatened him into silence, and searched him at will. They stripped Shen of his clothes and robbed him of his official documents and silver dollars. After the robbery, the bandits returned to their original boat and sped away. It is heard that Shen immediately returned to Ling by the original boat and took a boat back to the source to report the incident and request assistance in the investigation.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Smugglers Beat Salt Police to Death: Xu Weiquan, the captain of the salt police team stationed in Sanqishi, Cixi, received a report from a secret agent that a large number of salt smugglers would be passing through Zhangting. After receiving the report, the captain dispatched police officer Cai Zaixiang, along with salt police Wang Tonglin, Zhou Youjian, Qian Zhangquan, and Lv Wenzhang, to Fangjiagang, ten li from Zhangting, on the afternoon of the 3rd to wait. At around 4:00 PM, they saw more than 50 smugglers each carrying a load of salt approaching. Salt policeman Wang Tonglin immediately stepped forward to question them. However, upon seeing the salt police, the smugglers, without asking questions, used shoulder poles to beat them indiscriminately, killing salt policeman Wang Tonglin and taking away the wooden holster that Wang was wearing. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the other salt police opened fire in self-defense, also wounding seven smugglers.</p>
<p>False Alarm of Thieves: Military and Police Surround Girls' School: At around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, when there was a fire under the Kuqiao Bridge in front of the Drum Tower in Ningbo, many hooligans used large stones to smash the gate of the Ningbo Dingxin Street Adult Women's School, intending to take advantage of the fire to rob the school. All the teachers and students of the school suspected that they were thieves and panicked. The school janitor used the telephone to call the military and police agencies for help. Soon, hundreds of military and police officers arrived, creating a very tense situation. Seeing this situation, the students became even more frightened. Subsequently, the school principal, Qiu Shenzhi, knew that the military and police had arrived. While reassuring the students, she informed the military and police that there were no thieves inside the school. The military and police chiefs then realized that the school janitor had mistakenly reported the theft alarm and severely reprimanded him. The military and police then dispersed, but many of the female students were still terrified.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Silt in Qiantang River Obstructs Traffic: Silt in the Qiantang River has blocked the river's flow. The Shaoxiao Yidu Steamboat cannot reach its destination directly. Each day, the journey upstream along the river from the Zhakou to the Liuhe Pagoda to one side, up to the Changhe Guanshan in Xiaoshan to the other, takes at least one or two hours longer. The Qiantang River is a vital artery for traffic between Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Recently, due to the silt in the river, traffic has been obstructed, and passengers are complaining.</p>

<p>Society Affairs Meeting: The society affairs meeting was held at 2:00 PM. Chairman Chuan Shi said the meeting would proceed as usual. First, the chairman reported that the fourth annual meeting should have been held earlier, but was delayed due to the influence of the current situation. There were many accumulated cases over the years, and actual work could not be fully achieved. At the Society Anniversary on the 17th year of the Republic, it was resolved to reorganize the society, re-register members, and elect officers according to the new charter. Accumulated cases were gradually cleared, and the society's work proceeded in an orderly manner. As a result, the construction of the society's office in Shanghai was actively promoted and it was decided to hold the fourth annual meeting in the capital this year. Fortunately, the construction is now largely completed and work can begin soon. Now that peace is restored within the country, the fourth annual meeting of the society is also being held in an atmosphere of unity after the Fourth Plenary Session. The Fourth Plenary Session paid attention to construction, and the society's annual meeting also focuses on the society's construction, so this annual meeting is very meaningful. The purpose of the society is (to study truth, promote learning, exchange knowledge, and promote culture), but the academic journals and series published are all personal research, and the promotion of culture has not been fully achieved. Special efforts should be made in the future. Subsequently, Executive Secretary Ma Zongrong reported that the society's registration procedures had been completed, and the office building contract had also been processed and construction could begin soon. The existing publications, including *Xueyi* (Learning) Magazine, *Xueyi* Paper Collection, *Xueyi* Series, *Xueyi Huikan* (Learning Miscellany), and *Wenyi* (Literary Arts) Series, will continue to be published as before. Ancient books that have been out of print and lost abroad, such as novels and operas from the Yuan and Ming dynasties, have already been successfully reprinted in several cases. It is planned to publish one hundred types of *Xueyi Huikan* and one hundred world-renowned works, some of which have already been published. In addition, it is planned to plan and issue socialized *Xueyi Wenku* (Learning Library) and Japanese language lectures, etc. There are also ways to introduce new domestic publications, which will be published monthly in the society's monthly report for scholars to refer to. Furthermore, the society's members are not biased towards one faction or system. Any intellectual in the country can be a member of the society to promote cultural movement. Next, Accountant Gao Shiguang reported on the financial situation, and Liu Shiying reported on the purchase of land and construction of the office. Then the proposals were discussed.</p>

<h3>Western Group A Match: Yuehua and Navy Tie</h3>
<p>Result: 2-2</p>
<p>—Yuehua Gradually Improving—</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yuehua had Zhou Xianyan and Li Ning, and Cao Guicheng and Chen Yutian were added. They have risen from the sound of undefeated battles and fought against the Navy, resulting in a 2-2 draw. This is the first good news for Yuehua in this Group A competition. Referee: Si Daotuo.</p>
<h3>Yuehua's First Draw</h3>
<p>This year, Yuehua's athletes are scattered, and it has fallen from its highest position to last place. Recently, Li Huitang retired from business, and the situation has become more bleak. Fortunately, veterans Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and Chen Yutian are still supporting the remaining situation, and Cao Guicheng has been able to work hard for the team, resulting in yesterday's first draw. Otherwise, they would have inevitably lost.</p>
<p>—Yuehua Team Lineup—</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Xie Guozhu, Wang Shusen, Gao Dahan, Qian Jingyong, Zhou Shaowen, Lu Zhongen, Chen Yutian, Cao Guicheng</p>
<h3>The Navy is Also Strong</h3>
<p>The Navy initially had no outstanding reputation in Shanghai football. However, after defeating Lax in the Shi Chunta Cup the other day, people paid attention to them. Their internal and external unity and good offense and defense make them a strong team. Right inside forward Lash's shots are truly amazing. Both goals were scored with his quick and strong feet. Otherwise, with Zhou's goalkeeping skills, how could he have succeeded?</p>
<p>—Navy Team Lineup—</p>
<p>Haimen, Smith, Cox, Xu Men, Robertson, Bros, Que Bulunke, Lao Fulu, Bingsheng, Lash, Nallege</p>
<h3>Yuehua Scores a Success</h3>
<p>In the sound of the silver whistle, the athletes of the two teams began to compete. Cao Guicheng rushed into the enemy's formation and passed to center forward Lu Zhongen. Lu passed it far to Chen Yutian, who carried the ball deep into the territory. It was then acquired by Cao Guicheng, who once again picked it up. The Navy inside defense panicked. Left inside forward Zhou Shaowen scored a goal against the goal, only two minutes into the game.</p>

<h3>Navy Scores Two Goals in a Row</h3>
<p>The Navy attacked repeatedly without success. The muddy, wet, and slippery conditions in front of the Yuehua goal were like a natural fortress, and Li Ning was imposing and Zhou Xianyan stood alone. The Navy could only sigh at the goal. Cao Guicheng and Chen Yutian also tried to advance at risk but retreated due to the lack of support from their teammates. At 30 minutes, the Navy's Lash scored with his lightning-fast feet, tying the score at 1-1. Eight minutes later, they scored another goal. In the first half, the Navy scored two goals and Yuehua scored one.</p>
<h3>Cao Guicheng Shows His Skills</h3>
<p>At the start of the second half, the Navy went all out, with five tigers advancing together, surrounding the goal and attacking continuously. The entire Yuehua army retreated to defend. Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and Guan Xun'an had no peace at all. After ten minutes, Yuehua suddenly broke through the encirclement and launched a major counterattack. First, Li Ning passed the ball to Lu Zhongen, who carried it to the front and then passed it to right wing Cao Guicheng. The inside defense lost their footing, and Cao Guicheng drove straight in and scored a goal. After the score was tied at 2-2, the Navy counterattacked fiercely, and Yuehua's area was occupied by blue-eyed men, with hardly a clean patch of land. The Navy's shots came in a continuous stream, like dense rain, but they ultimately failed to break through the defense. The result of the match was a 2-2 draw.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Defeats Baota by a Large Margin in the Chinese Football Tournament</h3>
<p>Result: 8-0</p>
<p>Zhenru, with its invincible prestige, dominated the Zhongzi group of the Chinese Football Association for a time. Yesterday, they defeated Baota by a large margin of 8-0. Baota is also a leader in this group, but when compared with Zhenru, they appear clumsy and willingly admit defeat.

The goal scorers were: Zhong Lianji (2 goals), Luo Haiguang (4 goals), Zeng Rongzong (1 goal), and Yang Baosen (1 goal).</p>

<p>Jingwu vs. Yaguang: The strength of the two teams was evenly matched, and it was difficult to tell who was better. The scores were consistently close, but Jingwu was in the lead.

<h3>Jiangnan University Football Tournament</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University defeated Guanghua 4-1</p>
<p>Jinan University defeated Zhonggong 9-1</p>
<p>—Match between Jiaotong University and Guanghua—</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Championship match between the football teams of Guanghua and Jiaotong Universities was held at Xujiahui at 2:30 PM yesterday. As a result, Jiaotong University defeated Guanghua 4-1. There were many spectators around, and both sides cheered with cheerleaders and various slogans, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>In the first half, Guanghua was in a precarious situation and could barely defend, let alone attack. Jiaotong University's surprise attacks were very intense. Jiaotong University won 2-0. In the second half, Guanghua showed some promise and the situation was slightly balanced, resulting in a score of 4-1. The strength of the two teams was originally very evenly matched. Fudan had tied Jiaotong University 1-1, and Guanghua had defeated Fudan 2-1. However, Jiaotong University defeated Guanghua 4-1, showing how unpredictable the outcome is. Guanghua was unfamiliar with the grass field, and the grass field was slippery after the rain, making them even more unable to perform, resulting in a crushing defeat. Referee: Yue Xiurong.</p>
<p>The competition was fierce, and both sides had opportunities but failed to score. At 27 minutes, Liu Ximeng, the center forward of Jiaotong University, opened the scoring. This ball was scored from more than ten yards away. Jiaotong University students cheered, and everyone far and near heard it. After this loss, Guanghua's morale was lost and, unfortunately, disaster struck. Four minutes later, they lost another goal. This ball was crossed by Fei Fuxu of Jiaotong University, and Wan Mian made a diagonal shot. The Guanghua inside defense was caught off guard, and Liu Ximeng of Jiaotong University took the opportunity to jump forward and put the ball in. The first half ended 2-0.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Guanghua was still mostly defending and rarely attacking. Zhang Jinrong of Jiaotong University also scored a goal. Under this heavy blow, Guanghua had to cheer up and try to counterattack. The Jiaotong University goal was in danger. Yang Renwei of Guanghua made a solo attack and passed the difficult situation. Seeing that the opportunity was ripe, he kicked the ball into the net. Guanghua students cheered for a while. Jiaotong University then launched a major attack. In the last five minutes, Fei Fuxu of Jiaotong University dribbled the ball and sent it to the front of the Guanghua goal. Wan Mian headed the ball into the goal in the chaos. As a result, Jiaotong University won 4-1. The lineups of the two sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Fei Fuxu</p>
<p>Chen Gongyu, Cheng Shaomo, Wan Mian</p>
<p>Li Chuanxin, Yang Huanghua, Liu Ximeng</p>
<p>Wang Gongchen, Shen Guanlan, Zhang Jinrong</p>

<p>—Match between Jinan and Zhonggong—</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Football Championship match between Jinan and Zhonggong was held in Wusong at 2:30 PM yesterday. Zhonggong's football skills have improved a lot in recent years, but Jinan is famous at home and abroad. Even though Chen Jiaqiu and Jiang Shanjing and others are participating in the Zhongzi group competition of the Chinese Association, their strength is still strong. As a result, they defeated Zhonggong 9-1. Referee: He Chunhui.</p>
<p>The field was uneven, and the ground was wet after the rain, making it difficult to play. In the first half, Jinan scored two goals first, and Zhonggong retaliated with only two. In the second half, Jinan's offensive became stronger, and Zhonggong had almost no resistance. Jinan scored one goal after another. As a result, the score was 9-1. Jinan was penalized once for a penalty kick. Zhonggong kicked it in, but before they kicked it, another ball had already run into the penalty area, so it was re-kicked and blocked by goalkeeper Liang Guanlian. After the game, Zhonggong offered tea and refreshments, and the hosts and guests dispersed in joy. The lineups of the two sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan University</p>
<p>Liang Guanlian, Huang Huanchang (off), Chen Xiu (on), Feng Yunyou, Liang Shutang, Zhuang Shihong, Chen Fuzhong, Chen Zhenhe, Fu Hexuan, Dai Linjing, Tong Rongwen, Mei Hongbao</p>

<h3>Zhenru International Radio Station Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than 2,000 Guests Attended</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen Congratulatory Telegrams Received</p>
<p>Broadcasting Began in the Morning</p>
<p>The International Radio Station built by the Ministry of Transportation in Zhenru held its opening ceremony yesterday. More than 2,000 representatives and guests attended. The opening ceremony began at 2:00 PM to the sound of military music, presided over by Minister of Transportation Wang Boqun and with Lu Guixiang as the master of ceremonies. The ceremony concluded at 5:00 PM. The details of the event are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Radio Station The site is located north of Zhenru Station, in front of Jinwang Temple, covering an area of over 191 mu. A small river runs west of the station. The layout of the radio station is very beautiful. There are two sections of machinery, with the power generation room in the middle. Behind the power generation room is the Sino-French radio station, and to the east is the Sino-American and Sino-German radio station. In the center is a reservoir, surrounded by stone streets. Yesterday's venue was built on the west side of the radio station, using temporary reed sheds that could accommodate thousands of people. Two wireless radio amplifiers were placed in the venue, so the sound was very clear during the speeches.</p>

Finally, Minister Wang Boqun gave a response. Afterwards, Wang led the guests to visit the various rooms.</p>
<p>Minister Wang's Speech The meeting began at 2:00 PM. First, the Chairman gave a speech, saying, "Today is the opening of the International Radio Station. I am grateful that the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government have sent personnel to guide us, and that representatives from various ministries and departments and people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, have been willing to come. This not only adds infinite glory to our opening ceremony, but also increases our spirit of enterprise immeasurably. In addition to our joy, we must thank you all. The International Radio Station is just one item in our material construction, but there are several reasons why we have rushed to prepare the International Radio Station. First, it is to meet the needs of the nation and the people, because the international telecommunications industry is not only a hub for international transportation, but also often a place where the national spirit is entrusted. Since our country's unification, its international standing has been increasing day by day, and with the gradual abolition of unequal treaties, agriculture, industry, and commerce have been developing. The relationship between our country and the people in the international community has also become more complex. The International Radio Station is both a means of transportation and a place where the national spirit is often entrusted. It must be completed as soon as possible to meet future needs. Second, it is to protect the right to international communication. Our country's international telecommunications industry has been controlled by foreign merchants for about 50 years. Foreign control of telecommunications tools has not only hindered national rights, but also affected the progress of politics, diplomacy, and commerce, preventing it from making long-term progress. Now that the country is undergoing reform, we should actively abolish unequal treaties and work hard to build new industries such as international radio stations to protect national rights. Third, it is to promote international sentiment. In the past, due to the lack of international transportation, foreigners often had unclear observations of our country and often criticized us as mysterious or backward. In the future, with the development of transportation, their views on our country will gradually change. From this, it can be seen that transportation is closely related to international sentiment. Although I dare not say that the establishment of the Grand Radio Station will achieve any results in this regard, it will still be of some benefit. Fourth, it is to increase the effectiveness of international propaganda. Our country's international communications industry is still in its infancy. Whenever incidents occur involving foreign countries, they always rely on their transportation tools to obscure the facts and reverse black and white. This is especially true when tragic incidents have occurred over the years. Therefore, whenever the people of our country are extremely angry, they always hate the lack of international propaganda tools. Now that the Grand Radio Station has been established, this shortcoming should be slightly reduced. The above four points are the reasons why we are rushing to build the International Radio Station. As for whether we can achieve them, we still need the joint care of all the guests and the people of the country. Next, there are also things about the preparations for the International Grand Radio Station that can be reported to you. Last February, the Ministry sent personnel to prepare the International Wireless Radio Station and ordered machines from French merchants to set up a Sino-French radio station in Pudong, Shanghai. At the same time, the Construction Committee also ordered machines from Germany and the United States and prepared to build an international radio station in Zhenru Baoshan Liuhang and an international branch station in Fenglinqiao, Shanghai. Last August, the Ministry received the wireless radio business run by the Construction Committee and merged the two preparatory offices of the Ministry and the Committee to focus on completion and supervise employees to actively proceed. In March of this year, the Fenglinqiao International Branch Station was completed. In April, it communicated with the Philippines, Hong Kong, and the Dutch East Indies, and relayed communications with Europe and the United States from the Philippines. In November, the Grand Radio Station was fully completed and tested communication with San Francisco in the United States and Berlin in Germany with excellent results. From the start of the radio station's preparations to the present, it has taken one and a half years. The total construction cost is over 400,000 US dollars and about 540,000 in national currency. Although this project seems huge on the surface, after 1920, our country's international communications can be closely related to the world.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Boqun, Chairman of the International Radio Station Opening Ceremony, Taken by Our Newspaper</h3>
<p>We will no longer worry about any obstacles or rely solely on foreigners. The joy is shared by all the people of the country. The International Grand Radio Station is of great importance. Although it has been successfully completed, the matter is still in its early stages, and wireless radio often affects radio waves due to climate differences. In case it is not sensitive enough in future use, I hope that the people of the country will not destroy it in order to achieve perfection. However, the Ministry will always strictly supervise and manage it to ensure that no accidents occur in order to live up to the enthusiasm of the people of the country. I also hope that people in China will continue to provide guidance at any time so that this emerging industry will become more perfect and the world will directly and indirectly enjoy its benefits. This is not only an honor for colleagues in the transportation industry."</p>
<p>Speech by the Central Representative Wu Daoyi, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters, said in his speech, "Today is the opening day of the International Wireless Radio Station. From my personal point of view, although there are many issues related to the progress of the world, the development of the nation, and the promotion of civilization, many of them are related to transportation. Our country has not paid much attention to the transportation industry and has fallen behind others. The establishment of the International Radio Station is quite gratifying. The International Radio Station is like a person's throat and tongue. Without a radio station, it is like a person without a throat and tongue who cannot speak. In the past, our country did not have an International Wireless Radio Station, so we suffered a lot of losses in the international community. Through the International Radio Station, we can improve our country's commercial and political situation. Many countries in Europe, America, and Japan have established International Radio Stations. The radio station machinery is all manufactured by themselves, and they are constantly researching and making rapid progress. However, the structure and equipment of our country's radio stations all rely on foreigners. I am quite regretful about this. In the future, I hope that our people can build the second and third International Radio Stations themselves, which would be even more glorious."</p>
<p>Speech by the National Government Representative Zhangqun, the representative of the National Government and the Executive Yuan, said in his speech that the International Radio Station built by the Ministry of Transportation has been completed today. I think there are two major radio stations in Shanghai, and the address is only two or three minutes away from Shanghai. Whether it is in transportation or communication, it will be very convenient in all aspects. In fact, the Chinese and foreign citizens of Shanghai will also have many conveniences. The beginning of our country's telecommunications business was in the early years of the Qing Guangxu period. Today, it has been more than 50 years. However, all telegraphs have only two types: land lines and water lines. The establishment of telegraph offices is only in eight places: Shanghai, Wusong, Chongming, Guangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Harbin. The scale is very small, and it is very difficult to communicate with the international community. Even domestically, there are sometimes obstacles. At that time, there were only two international land lines: the Sino-Russian line and the Sino-French line. The Sino-Russian line ran from Zhangjiakou Chaketu through Siberia to our country. The Sino-French line ran from Vietnam through Annam to France. The sea lines included the Shanghai-Sasebo line and the Shanghai-Nanyang line. The above two lines passed through places such as Qingdao, Hong Kong, and Nagasaki. However, this type of business was entirely controlled by foreigners, such as the Great Northern and Great Eastern companies. Our country's economy was manipulated, and national rights were inevitably abandoned. However, this matter is related to unequal treaties, but it can really be said that we did not have our own construction. For example, we have been promoting domestic goods everywhere recently. Promoting domestic goods is a patriotic action. If everyone loves the country and the supply of domestic goods is not enough, then what will happen? This is very clear. Now that the International Radio Station has been completed, we will no longer have to borrow from foreigners. However, I hope that we will continue to work hard, on the one hand, to abolish unequal treaties, and on the other hand, not to think that having one radio station is enough. Only when we have international radio stations in the country can we be considered to have achieved construction."</p>
<p>Speech by the Guests Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting said in his speech that in my opinion, the degree of radio communications in the future is immeasurable. Foreigners have made more rapid progress in radio than our country. Our country does not use scientific methods, so the radio communications business cannot progress. The establishment of the International Radio Station is a good sign of the progress of the radio communications business. The only benefit of the radio station is that our country can speak for itself in the future without having to rely on foreigners. Nowadays, many foreigners do not understand what our country's country is like, what our nation is like, what our construction policy is, and what our political strategy is. The people of our country also do not understand the situation of foreign countries. Both sides feel isolated, and misunderstandings arise from time to time. In the future, we can use the transportation methods of radio stations to understand each other's claims and understand each other's situations. It can be seen that radio stations do have great benefits. In remote and blocked places such as Gansu, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, transportation is blocked, and it takes about ten days to receive a telegram. After the radio station is built, it can be reached quickly, and the people of the country can better understand the domestic situation. Only when the domestic situation is clear can we deal with foreign countries. Therefore, the use of radio stations is extremely great, and it is not only related to transportation. In addition, Ye Huijun also gave a speech (omitted). Foreign guests included the French Consul and others who gave speeches.</p>
<p>Speech by the French Consul General The French Consul General Gamglin said in his speech, "Foreign Minister Wang, ladies and gentlemen, the opening of the Chinese International Radio Station marks the complete independence of the new China's wireless communication with Europe. This move is extremely important. I am pleased to see that French expertise has helped the Chinese allies to develop this necessary product of a modern country. In recent years, although French experts have not tried to implement patent policies in China, they have assisted the National Government in the Chinese wireless radio business. The establishment of wireless radio communication between China and Europe is a great honor, and I am very satisfied with the assistance of French experts. On March 4, 1920, a contract was signed with the French Wireless Radio Company stating that wireless communication between China and Europe would be relayed by the French Saint-Étienne radio station. A 15-kilowatt shortwave transmitting station was set up in Zhenru, a receiving station was set up in Liuhang, and a wireless radio station was set up in the Sassoon building in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony is for the above-mentioned places. The equipment is unseen in the East, such as the wireless radio frame and the camera, which are only available in major cities around the world. I would like to extend my congratulations to Minister Wang Boqun of the Ministry of Transportation, because Minister Wang has the courage to move forward without fear of setbacks, and that is why we have today's achievements. I would also like to extend my congratulations to my old friends, Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Transportation, and Wen Yuqing, Director of the Wireless Radio Administration. When the three French experts were doing their best to help the Chinese government build its business, I would like to toast to Baski, the representative of the French Wireless Radio Company, who negotiated the contract in 1920, as well as Shawai, who built the project, and Gu Liwah, who calibrated all the programs in the radio station. I congratulate this business run by the Chinese and French, which is related to national progress and ethnic connections."</p>
<p>Wang Boqun's Response Briefly stated that Chen Meng and all walks of life came, and he was honored to receive congratulations from the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Although the wireless radio station was established this time, due to financial constraints, the various equipment was extremely simple, and safety equipment was not installed outside the ground. These are all shortcomings. I hope to do my best to improve it in the shortest possible time. After the National Government's finances are slightly more abundant, there should be a slightly more complete installation."</p>

<h3>Shipping Association Protests Japanese Inland River Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>Please Expedite the Central Government's New Treaty</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association telegraphed Nanjing on the 5th, presenting to the Central Party Department, the National Government's Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications, stating: The foreign encroachment on our country's inland river navigation rights is truly a legacy of unequal treaties. Fortunately, there is an awakening above and below, and a consensus to prepare to recover the restrictions of the past decades will soon be lifted. However, among foreigners, the most prominent who harbor aggressive ambitions and are unwilling to give up easily are our eastern neighbors, the Japanese. Therefore, they spare no effort in scheming and plotting, devising various strategies in an attempt to retain the rights they have already seized. Last year, there was a discussion between our country and their country to revise the new treaty. They once used the principle of reciprocity to lure us, but it was met with extreme opposition from our government and people. The Association also issued a declaration to state the advantages and disadvantages and express our determination. Although the discussion was suspended, a year has passed, and the new treaty has not yet been negotiated. Whether the right of navigation can be recovered is still at a critical juncture in a precarious situation. Now, reading the November 21st newspaper report on the remarks of the president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce after returning to Shanghai, one section states: The Japanese Chamber of Commerce in China has proposed that the right of inland river navigation is related to the lifeline of Japanese merchants. I have tried my best to run around and lobby, and have received the strongest assistance from the authorities of the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The most helpful are the leaders of the Japan-China Association and the directors of the Asia Bureau, etc. This shows that their country's officials and businessmen are working together with all their strength without the slightest slackness on this matter. The members of the Association were shocked and alarmed upon hearing this news, worrying about the past. Therefore, after discussion by the Executive Committee, there was a resolution to submit a request for attention. I dare to telegraph and appeal, hoping that you will pay attention during the negotiation of the new treaty, adhere to the principle of recovering lost navigation rights, and persevere until the goal is achieved, so as to comfort the public and protect national rights. I dare to make this statement and humbly ask for your attention and instruction. I cannot express my expectations enough. The Shanghai Shipping Association bows and sings.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Naval Reception</h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>Farewell to Minei by Haibu Tonight</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan Flew to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Commander in China, Minei, has been transferred and replaced by Rear Admiral Shiozawa, who has already officially taken over the position. Last night at 8:00 PM, Minei and Shiozawa hosted a banquet at the Great China Hotel on Gordon Road, inviting important figures from the Chinese naval community. Vice Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan specially flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to participate in the grand event. Chief of the General Affairs Office of the Navy Department Li Shijia and Director of the Ordnance Bureau Ren Guangyu also went to the banquet. Those who were invited to accompany included naval attachés from various countries, totaling about a hundred people. The hosts and guests enjoyed themselves until 11:00 PM before dispersing. Chen Shaokuan and others have also scheduled a farewell banquet for Commander Minei and welcome the new Commander Shiozawa at the Navy Recreation Club on Jing'an Temple Road at 7:00 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>Recent Plunge in Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Foreign Press Says Gold Exchange Must Be Closed</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post says: Foreign bankers in this port have been silent about the recent fall in the silver market. Today (the 6th), their bank managers broke their silence and denounced those who trade in gold as commoners of Jiujiang Road, pointing out that the current plunge in silver prices is caused by these people. It is said that although China has recently sought assistance in silver prices, saying that countries restrict the sale of silver, these Chinese at the Gold Exchange are still allowed to squeeze into the market to seek personal gain. As a result, a few people have become rich, while the national industry and commerce have suffered great harm. Without these people manipulating the market, foreign exchange could be sustained for a long time, and silver prices would not have fallen so drastically. Therefore, for the benefit of the entire country, the Gold Exchange should be closed. These Jiujiang Road people have been doing bullish trading in gold bars, gold coins, and Japanese gold in recent days, weakening the silver market and harming others to seek their own benefit. Among them, the most affected are the legitimate merchants engaged in import and export trade. As a result, the price of silver in New York fell by 2% on Thursday, and China was affected by this. Before Thursday, the market was thriving and becoming stable, and people were optimistic. After these Jiujiang Road people manipulated it, the phenomenon of today occurred. Therefore, these speculators who specialize in margin trading and gambling in buying and selling short have caused great harm to commerce and the country. These people often squeeze the silver market to seek their own profit. Today, for the sake of the Chinese government, it is urgent to prohibit them. Closing the exchange is the only way to save the situation today, it is said.</p>
<h3>Naval Study Group to Go to England</h3>
<p>Navy Dispatches Warships to Protect Coastal and River Shipping</p>
<p>With the end of the war, the Navy Department has begun to reorganize the naval fleet. In addition to hiring British naval commissioners to train the navy in China, there are also plans to select students to practice naval warfare abroad. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Officer Corps to England to Learn Tactics In order to cultivate senior naval talent, the Navy Department has consulted with the British naval authorities to have the department select officers to join the British fleet to practice surface warfare tactics. This matter has been agreed to by the British Navy Department. Chen Shaokuan has selected eleven officers from the department, including Han Tingsheng, Zeng Wanli, and Lu Jiefu, to go to England to join the British fleet to receive surface warfare training and other academic studies. Commander Pitt, the British naval advisor hired by the department, will lead the group to London to join the fleet. After receiving the order, Pitt has come to Shanghai to handle the procedures for the students to go abroad and has purchased tickets from the British company in this port.</p>
<p>Coastal Line Protects Chinese Merchant Ships Naval escort has been implemented. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River have designated the Jiangkun and Chengsheng warships to patrol the Hanyi route and the Hanxiang route. In the coastal line, the situation in Zhejiang is the most unstable. Fishing boats in the Zhoushan and Shenjiamen areas are often stolen. The Navy Department has dispatched the Gongsheng warship to Zhejiang to specifically protect merchant ships and fishing boats in eastern Zhejiang. At the same time, the Coastal Defense Command has also increased the training of 80 escort teams specifically for the employment of Chinese ships. The various wheel bureaus have been notified, so the Wenzhou and Fujian ships of China Merchants and Sanbei will all hire teams to protect them.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee of the Foreign Affairs Discussion</h3>

The meeting was chaired by Shi Liangcai, the standing committee member, and recorded by Zhao TieZhang. First, the Director of the Affairs Office, Chen, reported on the progress of the association's affairs after the relocation of the office. Then, the various proposals were discussed in order: the establishment of a foreign news agency, the formulation of next year's work plan, the proposal to request the authorities to urge the British Far East Economic Survey Group to pay attention to the treatment of overseas Chinese and Chinese merchants in British territories, and the proposal to suggest the government provide relief. The latter proposal was put forward by Committee Member Lin Kanghou, with the general idea that the purpose of the British Economic Survey Group's visit to China was nothing more than to promote its trade volume with China. At the same time, the British and British territorial governments treat our overseas Chinese merchants harshly. This not only harms international sentiment, but also fundamentally contradicts the country's purpose of promoting trade between the two countries. Therefore, it is proposed that the authorities be requested to urge the group to pay attention to this matter so that it can recommend the government to improve treatment after returning home. After detailed discussion by the committee members, it was decided to immediately telegraph the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find ways to ask the group to pay attention to this matter and for the committee members to take the opportunity to speak at banquets hosted by various organizations in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Dexing Wheel Aground at Xindi</h3>
<p>ChengSheng Ship Rescue Ineffective</p>
<p>62nd Regiment Changes Ship to Yue</p>
<p>Wanshou Wheel Collaterally Damaged</p>
<p>The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has decreased greatly recently, making navigation for merchant ships very difficult. Groundings and accidents are common. The Sanbei Company's Dexing wheel in this port was reported by telegram yesterday to have suffered damage due to grounding in the upper reaches of the river. The original report of this matter is as follows:</p>
<p>Sailing to Yuezhou The Sanbei Dexing wheel was leased by the Transportation Office on November 29th to transport the entire 62nd Regiment of the 11th Division, officers, soldiers, and military supplies to Yuezhou for landing and orders. In total, there were about 2,000 armed comrades in the entire regiment. After boarding the ship in Beijing, they proceeded to the upper reaches of the river, and it was expected that they could reach their destination at noon on the 2nd of this month.</p>
<p>Aground at Xindi The wheel, carrying soldiers upstream to Hunan, did not stop at Hankou, but went straight to Yuezhou. By the 2nd of this month, it was approaching Xindi, about ten Chinese miles away. It happened that the water was receding upstream, and the tide was only eight or nine feet high at high tide and only six or seven feet high at low tide. Dexing needed eleven feet of draft, so the ship was grounded as it passed through the area. Moreover, because there were 2,000 people and various military supplies on the wheel, the weight was even greater, and the wheel was stuck in the sand and mud and could not move at all.</p>
<p>Navy Rescue After the Dexing wheel was grounded, the shipowner repeatedly tried to reverse the wheel, but could not get out. The shipowner, unable to escape, urgently sent a wireless request for help. Fortunately, the Chengsheng warship was anchored there and received the distress call. It immediately sailed to the rescue. The Chengsheng warship took the Dexing and opened at full speed to tow it to the center of the river, but it did not move at all. Then, they waited until high tide before towing again, but still could not escape. The depth of the grounding is evident.</p>
<p>Transfer Ship For Transhipment The Chengsheng warship exhausted its efforts for the day, but could not rescue the Dexing. The officers and soldiers on board were anxious to reach the Yuezhou defense area and could not stay for long. The shipowner and the captain of the Chengsheng warship discussed and telegraphed Hankou to transfer the shallow-draft Wanshou and Wanli wheels to Xindi. Using the method of drawing wood from under the cauldron, all the officers, soldiers, and ordnance on the wheel were ordered to be transshipped by the two wheels to Yuezhou first, so as not to delay military operations, and at the same time, to reduce Dexing's load and make it easier to tow out.</p>
<p>Hull Damaged The Shanghai Bureau only received a telegram yesterday stating that the Dexing wheel had transferred all the soldiers and ordnance on board by two ships and had been sailing to Yuezhou for more than a day. After Dexing lightened its draft, it was only rescued from the shallows for the second time during high tide. The hull was damaged a lot and is under investigation. After the investigation, another loss list will be sent to Shanghai for verification. It is now planned to tow it back to Hankou or directly to Shanghai for major repairs. The Wanshou is also Damaged According to the report, the Wanshou shallow-draft wheel, which transported the officers and soldiers to Yuezhou, also struck the beach when it left the shallows, and also rammed into the outer hull of the Dexing. Therefore, the Wanshou wheel's hull was also damaged, but it did not prevent it from sailing. It is now necessary to wait until it arrives in Yuezhou and unloads the officers and soldiers before returning to Hankou to investigate the details and report separately.</p>
<p>Xingshi Engine Damaged The bureau also has the Jianglun Xingshi, which was temporarily rented by the chairman to inspect the Yangtze River and suppress the bandits, and Jiangtian, Fulong Yongxing Guupu, Dexing, and Jiangxin and other boats. They were used to transport troops and headquarters personnel to Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces for bandit suppression. Now, the boats have been carrying soldiers upstream. The Xingshi was originally scheduled to transport soldiers to the west at the same time, but suddenly the engine in the wheel was damaged, preventing it from sailing. Yesterday, the shipowner urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Bureau to quickly transport machinery and materials, as well as hot and cold water pipe, and asked to send ship repair technicians and workers to Beijing to repair the ship.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Approves Extension of Special Freight Rate for Chinese Match</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants Panic</p>
<p>The Chinese Match Industry previously Foreign merchants invaded national goods, and business declined, so they specifically submitted to the Ministry of Railways to allow the Chinese match freight rate to be changed to a fourth-class system to show excellence and encourage. The Ministry of Railways has approved and approved it. Now, because the trial period will expire in February next year, representatives of the industry have submitted a request for an extension of several years to show sympathy. Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways approved the extension of the fourth-class system for one year and has informed the industry to inform them. However, it is heard that the Japanese match industry is very panic because this move is related to the lifeline of Japanese merchants, and they will not be able to invade the sales of Chinese merchants in the future. Therefore, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Japanese Consul General to submit a negotiation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting equal treatment, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japanese Chamber of Commerce Discusses the Issue of Railway Freight Treatment</h3>
<p>The Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held a general meeting of all members at the club yesterday (the 6th) at 1:00 PM, presided over by President Minerimon Yoshi. First, the president reported that the freight rates of the various railways under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Railways were different, and the treatment of Chinese and foreign merchants was different. The Japanese merchants were greatly affected. They should ask for serious protests. The president also explained that the case had been submitted to the acting minister Chongguang Kui to the Minister Wang for protest, but Minister Wang transferred it to the Ministry of Railways, and there has been no definite answer so far. After the directors expressed their opinions, they immediately decided to submit a request to the acting minister to continue to seriously protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the one hand, they listed the facts and telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition and submit negotiations, it is said.</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Pawn Industry Workers' Conference</h3>
<p>Party Representatives Strenuously Prevent Work Stoppage</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the citywide pawn industry workers held a representative assembly at the workers' union on the night of the day before yesterday at 9:00 PM. Over 100 representatives from various districts attended. Zhang Yaoming, a representative from the city party headquarters, was present to provide guidance. Cheng Tianzhai was publicly elected as chairman, and Deng Dunli recorded the proceedings. The chairman reported that the workers' union had submitted a request to the employers on July 31st of this year to revise the terms of worker treatment. The Social Bureau had set a deadline for labor and management to resolve the matter peacefully, but the employers had not sent a representative to negotiate. After the chairman's report, the party representative provided guidance, and then the proposals were discussed. It was resolved that all pawn industry workers in the city would unanimously engage in a work stoppage and petition the city party headquarters, the municipal government, and other institutions. However, the date of the work stoppage would be decided by a majority of the members. Thereupon, the city party representative, Zhang Yaoming, repeatedly advised and strenuously tried to prevent the strike. He argued that, regardless of the circumstances, the date of the work stoppage should be postponed for a few days to allow him to report back to the city party executive committee, which would then instruct the Social Bureau to make a final mediation. If, within this short period, the employers still lacked sincerity and mediation failed, then the workers could proceed with the work stoppage and petition. The representatives then decided to implement the work stoppage and petition the following Friday. However, they still hoped that the employers would implement revisions to the terms before the work stoppage to avoid a wave of strikes.</p>

<h3>Red Cross Received Disaster Report from Huayin Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a disaster report from Huayin, Shaanxi yesterday, the situation is particularly concerning and urgently disclosed as follows: Huayin is a barren and impoverished region with complicated and heavy taxation. During the Qing Dynasty, it supported passing troops and provided coolie labor to Beijia County (as the telegraph code reads). In years of good harvest, it also relied on Beijia County for grain supplies. After the reforms, coolie labor stopped. The grain supply for the Tongguan troops has never been sufficient. Therefore, eastern troops and coolies bear the brunt in Huayin, directly transporting supplies to Chang'an. Those coming from the west must change vehicles and horses in Huayin and send them east to the railway station. The annual transportation costs are often two to three hundred thousand, and the intangible losses from missing personnel and horses are even more incalculable. If we only consider the grain supply, the amount collected annually for the large army stationed in Tongguan, which is connected to the east, exceeds the regular maintenance costs by more than ten times. It is estimated that during the nineteen years, the grain supply for troops and coolies amounted to nearly twenty million yuan. The most impoverished areas bear this huge burden. Furthermore, years of military campaigns, famine, conscription, unwarranted levies, murder, arson, floods, droughts, windstorms, and locust plagues – every natural and man-made disaster has reached its limit. The income from a year of diligent labor is not enough to support the military and coolie expenses, and the legacies left by generations of ancestors are not enough to meet the demands. Bandits are like combs, soldiers are like rakes, and officials are like . The rich become poor, and the poor die. The dead cannot be brought back to life, and the living are left helpless and waiting for death. Markets are desolate, and villages are in ruins. Now that the overall situation has been settled, the surviving remnants can once again see the light of day. The weeds that harm the seedlings are about to be removed, and the fish stranded in ruts urgently await the river's nourishment. Therefore, we weep and earnestly plead for special grace and large amounts of funds to be quickly bestowed to rescue the afflicted people. It is hoped that the widespread cries of distress will have some effect. In our haste, we may be speaking carelessly. We humbly implore your consideration.</p>
<p>Representatives of the disaster-stricken people of Huayin: Wang Chongqing, Yuan Shuming, Shi Jingren, Jing Yizhai, all bowing and weeping.</p>

<h3>Patrol Vessels Outside Songkou Vigorously Suppress Pirates</h3>
<p>Intercepted a Pirate Ship</p>
<p>Killed More Than a Dozen Pirates</p>
<p>Rescued More Than Thirty Hostages</p>
<p>Now Sent to Kanmen for Disposal</p>
<p>The Gong Sheng patrol vessel of the Wusong National Coastal Defense Headquarters was patrolling the waters outside Wusongkou on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at approximately 5:00 PM when it suddenly spotted five pirate ships approaching rapidly in the distance in the waters off Jinshan Island. The vessel immediately pursued and engaged them. Unexpectedly, the pirate ships, upon seeing the patrol vessel approach, also opened fire and surrounded and attacked the vessel. The captain of the vessel, Wan Shaoxian, seeing the unfavorable situation, ordered the opening of machine guns and rapid-firing cannons. The pirates' momentum faltered, and they sailed away. The vessel pursued and intercepted a five-masted pirate ship on the spot, killing more than a dozen pirates. The rest fled into the water. More than thirty hostages, both male and female, young and old, were rescued. Four other pirate ships escaped due to darkness and rough seas. Yesterday, Captain Wan telegraphed the Coastal Defense Headquarters to report the defeat of the pirates. Director Wu reported that the intercepted pirate ship was reportedly a Fujianese merchant ship that had been seized by pirates near Beiguan. Therefore, Captain Wan sent the ship and the rescued hostages to Chairman Li of the Kanmen Chamber of Commerce for collection and distribution.</p>
<h3>Fictitious Business Names Used to Defraud Large Amounts of Goods</h3>
<p>Twenty-Nine Victims</p>
<p>Worth 38,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Case Solved in Changshu</p>
<p>Detectives Will Escort Suspects and Recover Goods</p>
<p>Shen Ziqing, a native of Shaoxing, fraudulently established three companies with fictitious names at Shandong Road and Wuhu Road in this municipality, and defrauded twenty-nine businesses, including Longhua Silk Factory, of goods worth 38,000 yuan. The case has been solved in Changshu, and seven large boxes of stolen goods have been recovered. The Zhabei Police Station has ordered detectives to go to Changshu to escort the suspects and recover the goods. The details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Setting up Companies with False Names In the autumn of this year, three companies with the names Fengtian Shen Zhuang suddenly appeared in this municipality. One was Hengxingde, located on Shandong Road in Wuma Road, and the others were Yongliren and Yongyihe, both located above the Tongshun Gong Warehouse on Wuhu Road. The managers of the three companies were all Cao Wenfu (actually Shen Ziqing's alias), and the internal accountants were Tao Heming (Shen's brother-in-law) and Xu Yaoting. They specialized in trading silk, foreign goods, and cosmetics. Initially, when purchasing goods from various merchants, they paid in cash. During the second transaction, they would owe half of the payment, promising to pay it on a specific date, and then they would pay on time to build trust with the factories. The factories also believed that Hengxingde and the other two shops did exist in Fengtian, so they trusted Shen even more when he purchased goods. Unexpectedly, in the final transaction, they did not pay at all.</p>
<p>The Discovery of the Fraudulent Scheme On the 27th of last month, Shen had taken goods worth over 10,000 yuan from Longhua Silk Factory in the name of Hengxingde. When the payment date arrived, Zhu Ganqing, a salesman from Longhua, went to Hengxingde to collect the payment and saw that Shen had absconded and all the goods in the shop had been moved away. Only a shop assistant, Pu Yousheng, had not left. He discovered Shen's alias and realized that they had been defrauded. Upon questioning, Pu Yousheng said that Shen had gone to Shen Jinzhang's place in Hongqiao, Zhabei. He tracked them there and found the goods were indeed there, but the two Shen's were nowhere to be found. He immediately reported to the local court and asked the Zhabei Police Station to arrest the suspects and recover the goods.</p>
<p>Victimized Businesses News of the fraud spread, and it was learned that the two companies, Yongliren and Yongyihe, had also collapsed, leaving only empty houses. Those who were defrauded included Tongming Electrical Material Factory, Zhenhua Weaving Factory, Hongyuan Silk and Satin Factory, Xu Jinji Huzhou Silk Factory, Meixin Silk Gauze Factory, Tongchang Sock Factory, Yusheng, Xiji, Sida, Jingda and other silk factories, Yitaifeng, Taifeng, Siyi, Longhua Silk Factory, Huitong, Yongyuan, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Anda Cloth Factory, Yixingtai, Sanmin, Shengxin, Yuansheng, Hongda, Zhenhe Cloth Factory, Jiuyi, Zhida, Fuchengxiang, Yongfa, Wang Rongji - twenty-nine businesses in total, with a total value of 38,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Arrest and Recovery of Goods Detective You A'gen of the Zhabei Police Station learned from Pu Yousheng, a shop assistant at Hengxingde, that Shen had sent two boxes of goods to Changshu before absconding, but the address was not detailed. He sent a letter to Xu Fengshan, the Shanghai-based detective captain stationed in Changshu, Suzhou, to investigate. Captain Xu, along with detectives Yang Baokang and Chen Guangcai, went to Yu, Changshu and joined forces with Zhu Shunqing, the captain of the local detective team. They captured Tao Heming at the Yinlou Association in Sangjia Lane and recovered nine boxes of goods. Two of the boxes were empty, and seven of them were filled with towels, undershirts, toothbrushes, soap, and other stolen goods.</p>
<p>Escorting the Suspects Back to Justice Upon questioning, Tao Heming denied colluding with Shen Ziqing to commit fraud, claiming that Shen owed him money, so he went to Shanghai to seize his goods as compensation. He claimed that he had entrusted relatives Qian Zhongchun and Chen Zhongqing to introduce and deposit the boxes at the Yinlou Association. Tao and the stolen goods were temporarily detained at the local public security bureau pending extradition. It was reported that Tao had purchased ten yuan worth of straw to cover the boxes when transporting them to Changshu. Captain Xu and others have returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 6th) and informed the Zhabei Police Station to prepare a document to extradite the suspects and recover the goods. Zhu Ganqing is staying at the No. 1 Hostel outside Yanmen in Suzhou. It is heard that there are new developments in the case in Suzhou.</p>
<h3>A Robbery of a Car by Bandits in the French Concession Last Night</h3>
<p>The Car Was Rented from Zhapu Road</p>
<p>Driven to the French Concession and Robbed</p>
<p>The Driver Reported to the Police After Being Driven Out</p>
<p>Still Not Found by Midnight</p>
<p>At 8:55 last night, a dashing customer dressed in Western-style clothes, wearing a felt hat, and speaking with a local accent, who appeared to be around thirty years old, suddenly arrived at the Dalong Automobile Company at Nos. 136-138 Zhapu Road, Hongkou. He claimed to be named Chen Xianglin and said he needed to hire a car to drive around. The company's accountant heard this and, judging by his appearance, assumed he was a student and did not suspect anything. He immediately ordered the driver, Gu Jinbao (from Suzhou), to drive the No. 18117 (City No. 514) convertible car. The young man sat upright in the car and ordered the driver to drive to the French Concession. The driver started the engine and drove south. When the car reached the vicinity of Route Lafayette and Rue du Père Froc, the young man suddenly ordered the car to stop. As the car was still slowing down, two people suddenly emerged from the roadside, raised their hands to signal the young man, continued to board the car, drew out handguns, and forced the driver out of the car. The driver, intimidated by their force, was dragged out of the car, and one of the robbers drove off westward like a bat out of hell. The driver shouted for help to no avail and ran to the Louza Wan General Police Station to report the incident. The head of the police station, upon hearing the news, immediately informed the special agency to send detectives to investigate and used the telephone to notify all police stations in the Public Concession and the various district offices of the Chinese Public Security Bureau to be on the lookout for the car. However, the car had not been found by midnight, and no other incidents had been reported. It was also heard that the Dalong Automobile Company had also experienced a similar incident last autumn, when bandits rented a car near Fudan University and kidnapped a hostage.</p>
<h3>Indian Policeman Accused of Disobedience</h3>
<p>Interrogation at the British Consulate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Indian policeman, Ka Tai Xin, was accused of distributing seditious texts with another Indian, Que Nan Xin. Yesterday (the 5th) the case was opened at the British Consulate's police court. Que Xin asked to reserve judgement, while Ka Tai Xin declared in court that it was amazing that they were requesting the government for rights and were now being accused of sedition. Ever since a foreign government ruled India, the blood and bones of the Indian people were being sucked. Such a government cannot be expected to bestow benevolence. The Indian people are being worn down by tyrannical rule and can no longer endure it. Today, they cry out loudly. The current authorities imprison three quarters of those who love their country and put in effort for their country. They are willing to accept any ruling, but the Indian people will inevitably use force to break the bonds of oppression. As long as they have a breath left, they will resist the government. It is noted that the two defendants are accused of distributing or spreading seditious printed material at the corner of Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road on the 25th. At the last hearing, one refused to face the judge and struggled with a Western police chief who forcibly turned him around. Neither defendant hired a lawyer and defended themselves. Que Nan Xin was later convicted of privately hiding weapons and sentenced to one month of imprisonment with hard labor. Another Indian named Tai La Xin was detained in the same case and sentenced to one week in prison and fined seven dollars and eight cents. The trial for the sedition charges for Ka Tai and Que were set to be continued at a later date.</p>

<p>It Can Be Said He Died for His Studies</p>
<p>Body Collected by Friends</p>
<p>Yang Tihwai from Rong County, Sichuan, studied at the University of Robechs, France and this year earned a bachelor's degree in textile engineering. He returned to China last month and first went to Beijing. Because traffic on the Pinghan Railway had not yet been restored, he detoured, planning to take a boat west from Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he resided at the YMCA dormitory on Sichuan Road. At 4:15 PM the day before yesterday, he jumped out of the window from the fourth floor of the building where he was staying and was severely injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment, as was reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, Yang's injuries were too severe, and he soon died. Upon receiving the report, the General Police Station dispatched Chinese detective Wu Junqing and Western detective to transport the body to the forensic laboratory on Ferren Road for examination. It was found that the deceased had no relatives in Shanghai. Only two friends, Wu Jialun and Tang Shicheng, currently managers at Ruita Ni Rong, No. 616 Nanjing Road, were found. Tang, a bachelor of engineering, met the deceased by chance during his journey back to the country. According to Wu, Yang's suicide was purely due to a nervous breakdown. Rumors that he was unemployed and took this action were false. Yang studied textile engineering very diligently in France, and his mental faculties became weakened. When his ship passed Taiwan on his way back from France, he had a major nervous breakdown. Therefore, when he arrived in Shanghai, this illness recurred, and he spoke deliriously, which resulted in this tragic incident. It can be said that he died for his studies. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, arrived at the forensic laboratory for an examination. Wu Jialun claimed that he was willing to claim the body for coffin and burial. Magistrate Guo then instructed that Yang Tihwai's body be handed over to Wu for signing and collection for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Extortion Within Extortion</h3>
<p>The Case Is Extremely Bizarre and Worth Investigating</p>
<p>How Should Xue Bin Be Thoroughly Investigated?</p>
<p>Zhou Hesong, a local man, 31 years old, has been operating a redwood shop at No. 122 Huitongguan Street, Nantao, and his business has been relatively prosperous. Therefore, Zhou has some savings, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. For months, Zhou has been receiving four letters by mail, in which the senders claimed to be from a "dare-to-die team," demanding to "borrow" 1,000 yuan, or they would take drastic measures. The wording was extremely fierce. The last letter had reduced the amount to 300 yuan, instructing Zhou to wrap the money and send it to No. 71 Haichao Temple Road, outside Xiaonanmen, to be handed over to a man named Yao Baoshan at 5:30 PM yesterday. If he did not come, they would personally come to "welcome" him. After receiving these threatening extortion letters, Zhou immediately reported them to the First Precinct of the First District, requesting a thorough investigation and punishment. Upon receiving the notification, the Detective Team, led by Dong Mingde, the leader of the Nantao Precinct, along with detectives Yuan Haishan, Lu Anpu, Yu Maolong, Ren Shuzhi, Xu Yulin, and others, instructed Zhou's friend Zhu Jinde, a native of Shaoxing, to wrap fake banknotes and prepare them. Yesterday, they went to the address on time for negotiation. The detectives made their reconnaissance inside and outside the house. When Zhu took the money into the house and inquired, Yao Baoshan came out to meet him. The detectives immediately rushed in, arrested Yao, and took him back for questioning. Yao claimed that his name was Shan Bao, that he was 19 years old from Pinghu, and that his father's name was Yao Hanhou, who operated a rice shop at No. 34 Tangji Bridge in his hometown. He graduated from Yachuan Middle School and came to Shanghai this summer to study in the high school department of Junyi Middle School. He initially boarded at No. 6 Tiandeli near the school. One day, a woman came to talk to him, and they became quite friendly. She asked if he had a pillow, and he said he did not. She sent him a pillow the next day. Several days later, he noticed that her behavior was inappropriate, so he refused to let her come again. Unexpectedly, she still came from time to time. Unable to bear the harassment, he secretly moved to his classmate Lin's house at No. 71 Haichao Temple Road. Unexpectedly, she found out and came again. He scolded her and drove her away. She became angry and incited a group of hooligans to beat him up and extort money from him. Knowing he could not win, he was introduced to Xue Bin by a friend, Xu Qinghe. Xue mediated and had him pay 3 yuan to settle the matter. Xue had come to his place three or four times. Recently, he suddenly received a letter claiming that someone would send several packages of medicine cakes to him to be collected on their behalf. As a result, he was framed. He said that he did not know anything about the reasons, and he showed the original letter from Xue. The detectives carefully checked it and found that the handwriting was completely consistent with the threatening letters Zhou had received. Yao also claimed that Xue Bin practiced martial arts at the City No. 1 Martial Arts Hall and lived on Zhonghua Road in Xiaoximen. His father ran a machine factory. The detectives went to the address, but Xue Bin had already fled, only his mother, Mrs. Xue Yan, a native of Anhui, was arrested and brought back, and then sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>No Hope for Resolution in the Nanyang Medical College Dispute</h3>
<p>President Adds Charges</p>
<p>Students Request Extension for Reconciliation</p>
<p>Nanyang Medical College President Wu Zongqing and the college's student union executive committee members Liu Zefu, Gao Changguo, Lu Yiqiu, and eight others had disagreements over school affairs, leading to mutual accusations and the hiring of lawyers at the Special District Local Court. After the court ordered them to go outside for reconciliation, as reported in the newspaper, it is now learned that the relationship between teachers and students at the college has reached a breaking point and cannot be repaired. Not only is reconciliation hopeless, but Wu Zongqing has now added charges, stating that Liu Zefu and others admitted in court during the last hearing that they had jointly invaded the school's office on November 5 and chased away teachers, falsely claiming to be maintaining school affairs. The investigation found that Liu and others had entered and taken over, damaged, and sealed off the office without the permission of the authorities, violating Article 317 of the criminal law. Furthermore, the defendants admitted in court that they were members of the student union and the maintenance association, so the rights and actions of the student union and the maintenance association should be the responsibility of Liu and others. Therefore, the plaintiff requested that the defendants be punished in accordance with the aforementioned articles of law and Article 118, paragraph 1, of the criminal law. Liu Zefu also requested the court to summon several professors from the school to prove that students were still attending classes normally on the morning of the 5th and that the order was good. He also requested that the officers of the maintenance association, Zheng Xiansheng, Guan Guanwu, Huang Qibai, and Chen Mingbo, as well as the detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station, be summoned to testify that the sealing of the safe was not done by Liu and others, but that Wu Zongqing instigated the arrest. Yesterday was the date for the continuation of the trial. The students' lawyer requested another postponement in order to seek a method of reconciliation, and Wu Zongqing's lawyer also agreed. Gao Changguo then stated in court that if there was a reconciliation, the court would have to resolve it. Judge Ge ordered that the hearing be held again on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Continuation of the Case Against He Gengxing and Others</h3>
<p>Awaiting Letter from the Zao Gong Temple for Investigation Before Retrial</p>
<p>He Gengxing, a compradore at Mitsui Yangxing, abandoned his job and absconded in May. At the same time, Hongyu and Huiyu, two hardware stores he opened on Tianzhu Tang Street in the French Concession, filed for bankruptcy with the French Public Concession. After sending an accountant to clear the accounts, He's creditors, Hengyu and eight other money shops and Zhengda Bank, sent representatives to the accountant's office to investigate the accounts and discovered evidence of collusion and fraud with He Junxing, Ma Changjia, Jin Youcheng, Jin Youzhang, and others. They hired lawyers Wang Fuchang and Yuan Hanyun to accuse He and the other four of jointly defrauding and taking property at the Special District Local Court. The summons was issued some days ago, but since the defendants had not all arrived, a new date was set, as was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for the continuation of the trial. First, he asked the five defendants, He Gengxing and others, about their ages and addresses. Then, he questioned the plaintiff's representative, Wang Honglai. He said that this case arose because He requested bankruptcy, and that the Hongyu and Huiyu hardware stores were both located in the French Concession. He Gengxing also claimed to reside in the French Concession, and the bankruptcy was approved by the French Public Concession. Then why was the case not filed with the French Public Concession? The plaintiff's lawyer, Wang Fuchang, replied that this case differed from the one handled by the French Public Concession in three points: (1) the plaintiffs are different. Hengyu Money Shop was not involved in the accusation to the French Public Concession, but is now included. (2) The accused are different. The accusation to the French Concession only involved He Gengxing, but now includes He Junxing and the other four, and these four all live in the Public Concession. (3) The facts of the accusation are different. The accusation to the French Public Concession was that He Gengxing absconded with money, but now the defendants colluded to conceal property and harm the interests of the creditors. Furthermore, the French Public Concession is not a formal Chinese court, and according to Article 17 of the Litigation Regulations, related cases can be transferred to your court for handling. He Gengxing's lawyer, Wang Youling, refuted the points raised by the plaintiff's lawyer one by one, saying that the first point could not be established because a plaintiff could not be arbitrarily added to bring a case to another judicial organ. Secondly, He Gengxing was the defendant in the French Public Concession and is also the defendant in this case, and there is no such thing as being tried in two places. Thirdly, the accusation in the French Public Concession was that he violated Article 363 of the criminal law, and the same is true now. He requested that the portion of the accusation against He Gengxing be rejected. The lawyers for the other four defendants argued that the judicial organ where the incident occurred had jurisdiction over criminal cases. After the plaintiff's lawyers argued, the plaintiff's lawyer finally stated that He Gengxing's actual address was not in the French Concession, and that he had been accused by a Ningbo money shop in your court before. A review of the case file would reveal the truth. Judge Wu then ordered a letter to be sent to the Jian Public Concession to investigate the bankruptcy situation of Gengxing and the rest, and then to review the situation.</p>
<h3>The Result of Free Love</h3>
<p>Misunderstanding the Marriage Autonomy Law</p>
<p>Chen Mingqi Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</p>
<p>Lan Lianchen, who wrote the name card for Holland Yangxing and lived in Huajinpailou in the city, had a daughter named Lan Xufang. She studied at Ai Qun Girls' School and loved freedom. She had a free love relationship with Chen Mingqi, a handsome young man in Western clothes. Unexpectedly, her father betrothed Xufang to a wealthy Wen family in Nanxun last year. Lan Xufang was only nineteen years old last year and did not meet the marriage autonomy law, so she fled to the Women's Association for a year. This October, Chen discussed with Lan Xufang that Xufang was already 20 years old and had reached the age of marriage autonomy. In fact, she would not turn 20 until her birthday in March of next year. They misunderstood the law and hired a lawyer to rashly publish a marriage notice. At the same time, they held their overly free wedding at Ximenli, Ximen Road. As a result, Lan Lianchen angrily reported the incident to the police, and they were arrested and sent to the local court for investigation. They were prosecuted for enticing a woman under the age of twenty. Although Chen tried his best to argue that the woman agreed, the law states that those under the age of twenty are of weak will, so the crime was established. Yesterday morning, Court President Shen brought Chen to court and announced the verdict, sentencing him to six months in prison. He has been imprisoned. Lan Xufang has returned home with her father and is following her father's wishes.</p>
<h3>Feng Sanbao Dies from Serious Injuries Inflicted by an Enemy</h3>

<h3>The Fate of Chen Guibao: What is to Become of Her?</h3>
<p>First Husband Poisoned</p>
<p>Second Husband Goes Mad</p>
<p>Chen Baokang, from the western countryside of Longhua, worked as a carpenter. He had a daughter named Guibao, aged 22. Two years ago, her uncle arranged for her to be betrothed to Jiang Erbao, the young owner of a tofu shop in Xujiahui. Last September, as the wedding date approached, Jiang Erbao contracted syphilis and died. This spring, a neighbor again acted as matchmaker, arranging for Guibao to marry a Mr. Lang who owned a barrel-making shop in Zhabei. The engagement took place in April of this year, and the Lang family had already chosen an auspicious date in November for the wedding. They asked the matchmaker to inform the Chen family. However, Chen received news that Mr. Lang had suddenly gone mad and was bedridden. Mr. Lang, knowing the wedding date was near and fearing he would be unable to marry as planned, discussed with the matchmaker a postponement until he fully recovered. Chen, upon learning this from the matchmaker, was very anxious, as madness is difficult to cure quickly. Guibao eventually learned the truth and questioned her father. Chen initially hid the truth, but after her persistent inquiries, he had to tell her. Guibao lamented her fate and told her father that she was destined for misfortune and would not marry, desiring to enter a nunnery instead. She asked her father to quickly dissolve the engagement with Mr. Lang. Her father, fearing that his daughter would become ill with worry, comforted her. On the 2nd of this month, Guibao, taking advantage of her family's inattention, took a small bundle and left home, never to return. Her parents were greatly alarmed when she did not return by evening and searched for her among their relatives, but all said she had not arrived. They became even more worried. For the past two days, her parents have been searching for her in the nunneries north and south of the city, but it is unknown whether they will find her.</p>
<h3>Female Servant Burned by Fire</h3>
<p>A Mr. Zhang from Guangdong, who works in the Nanjing government and resides at No. 127 Sida Lane, Sigao Road, employed a 36-year-old female servant named Zhang Ding from Yangzhou. Yesterday afternoon around 2 PM, while she was washing clothes in the kitchen, a bottle of kerosene oil placed on a wooden shelf suddenly fell and rolled into the stove. An explosion immediately erupted, filling the room with flames and severely burning her face, chest, arms, and hands. The scene was horrific. A police officer from the Third Precinct of the Fifth District was alerted and arrived, sending her to Tongren Hospital and then to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Her condition is reportedly critical.</p>
<h3>Anti-Opium Society Urges Strict Investigation of Major Drug Trafficking Case</h3>
<p>Fujian Organizations Petition for Investigation</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Opium Society, citing news from Geneva and reports in mainland newspapers on August 17th, stating that the British government had submitted a report to the League of Nations identifying Xiamen as a center for drug trafficking and Zhang Yongshun as a major drug trafficker, who was arrested at a station in Myanmar in September 1928 with ten cans of goods labeled as being produced in Germany, and it was found that this drug was commissioned by Xiamen physician Zhang Yongshun for purchase, and the rest was shipped to a business in London for transshipment elsewhere. According to the business, the goods were transported by the head office to Shanghai and then to Xiamen for physician Zhang Yongshun's use. Furthermore, in October of the same year, 32 taels of morphine, 500 taels of heroin, and 20 pounds of Persian opium were seized in Yangon. The heroin was also produced in Germany, under similar circumstances. This batch of drugs was also shipped to Xiamen Physician Zhang Yongshun. Among the aforementioned drugs, not only German heroin but also a large quantity of morphine bearing trademarks was intended to be sold through a British business, but the attempt failed due to the forged labels. In addition, 100 taels of heroin manufactured in Tokyo, Japan, along with 225 taels of heroin bearing the E. Merck trademark, were also seized at the same time. Based on these facts, the British government requested the League of Nations to protest to China. The Anti-Opium Society believes that Zhang Yongshun's drug trafficking harms the country, and his crime is unpardonable. Moreover, trafficking to Southeast Asia not only harms overseas Chinese but also damages the nation's reputation. Based on the facts presented by the British government, the society appealed to the Central Anti-Opium Committee. The committee then requested the Fujian Anti-Opium Committee to investigate. The Fuzhou and Xiamen authorities dispatched personnel to arrest the principal offender, but without success. It has been nearly two months, and the suspect is still at large. The various Fujian organizations have reported to the Anti-Opium Society, requesting continued efforts. Recently, the Xiamen Siming County Party Affairs Guidance Committee sent a letter advocating strict investigation and instructed local authorities to investigate. Furthermore, organizations such as the Shanghai Federation of All Circles and the Shanghai Fujian Student Association have advocated strict investigation to the Anti-Opium Society, and a joint meeting of various organizations has been held to resolve the issue of appealing to the government. In addition, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Society has advocated strict investigation of the use of these drugs. The Anti-Opium Society has followed the resolution of the General Assembly and requested the Central Anti-Opium Committee to investigate. Yesterday, it was reliably learned that the principal offender, Zhang Yongshun, is very influential and is using money to send his associates around to lobby in Beijing and Shanghai to avoid arrest. The society believes this case is as shocking as the Gao Yingtu case and has listed the facts to inform all parties to pay attention and unanimously advocate thorough resistance to emphasize drug prohibition and maintain national reputation.</p>

<p>Old Gentleman (looking at several wine bottles with disgust, speaking to a young man): How can you young people all love this stuff? What is the pleasure of getting drunk and senseless? I am already sixty years old and have never had a sip of alcohol.</p>
<p>Young Man: Poor old man, you have lived your entire life for nothing, not even experiencing some simple pleasures. You do not have much time left in this world. Have a glass now.</p>
<p>Doctor (on his rounds in the hospital, asking a nurse in one of the patient rooms): How is this patient? Is his heart condition improving?</p>
<p>Nurse: Much better. Since last night, he has proposed to me three times.</p>
<h3>Interesting News from the Japanese Depression</h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>During the European War, Western countries were preoccupied with military affairs and had no time for trade. The Far Eastern market was dominated by Japan. The capital of merchants suddenly increased, and the national economy became prosperous. Commentators called it the Golden Age of Japan, and the Japanese themselves called it "Upper Boom." However, extreme prosperity must decline. The more developed capitalism is, the greater the risk of overproduction. In recent years, the number of unemployed has increased, causing a great economic panic. The Japanese call it the Depression. In this era of depression, everything is being rationalized, so there are many good stories recorded in this discussion, which can be used to understand the Japanese countryside.</p>
<p>Rationalization of Marriage. Tokyo newspapers have published numerous articles about the rationalization of marriage. Because Japanese rural areas are widely troubled by the severe depression, rural men and women are thus inclined to rationalize marriage and greatly save on marriage costs. This is indeed a good story in the era of depression. The women's association of Tanio Village, Mie Prefecture, contributed three corners of gold each to make a complete set of wedding clothes for members to borrow and wear for marriage. It is said that since the set of wedding clothes was made, twelve new couples have borrowed and worn them for marriage. Among them, there are new couples who borrowed and wore them for the fourth time, and they are not very harmonious with each other. The sound of the Japanese reading (four) is like (death), which is suspected to be a bad omen, so they are depressed. In Isozawa Village, Fukushima Prefecture, the wedding ceremony, including the banquet, is not allowed to take more than two hours. Also, the women's youth group of Ichinichi Town, Akiyama Prefecture, jointly produced 93 yuan of sweat and blood money to make a wedding dress. Whenever a member is about to get married, they will wear this dress for marriage. However, November 8th was the wedding date of the three group members, and they competed with each other for this dress, almost to the point of fighting. Later, the group leader borrowed it from another village, and the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>Rationalization of Reading. There are three elementary schools in the village of Sengokuiwa, Nagasaki Prefecture. The students in the school are mostly children from farming families and are severely affected by the depression. Therefore, the teachers of each school jointly formed an elementary school farm, where they plant vegetables after school every day for living and for lunch at school (most of the students in Sengokuiwa Village's elementary schools are day students and send their lunch to school). In the past, the monthly cost of lunch was seven yuan, but now it is only five yuan. It is said that from April next year, students in the second grade and above in the village's elementary school will have to hand-copy textbooks to save costs and facilitate memorization.</p>

<h3>Record of the 29th Anniversary Celebration of the Patriotic Girls' School</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>The Patriotic Girls' School is the oldest girls' school in Shanghai, now in its 29th year. The old site in Tianbao Lane was too small, so this autumn, it was moved to Chenyuan on Jiangwan Road, where the flowers and trees are beautiful, making it a great place to study. Unfortunately, the buildings are still not enough, so this year's celebration was held at the school because the auditorium could not accommodate many people, and a grand celebration will be held next year for the 30th anniversary. This year, it was only held at the school for the teachers and students to enjoy. The anniversary ceremony was held on the morning of the second. Director Qu Sun Xiangzhong reported, and Mr. Zhang Shiaoan, the author, and students gave speeches, all of which were a mix of seriousness and humor, and there was thunderous applause. In the afternoon, there was the volleyball championship final, and in the evening, there was a variety of performances, which started at 6:30 PM and ended at 12:30 AM. There were thirty programs in total, including dances such as "Spring Comes to the World," a four-person dance, "Butterfly Love Flower," "Butterfly Girl," "Spring Breeze's Favor," "Flower Selling Song," "Mother's Heart," "Crane Matchmaker Dance," "Grasshopper and Bee," "Echo Dance," "Venus Descends," and "Little Painter," with clear songs and beautiful dances emerging one after another. In Beijing opera, Lei Zemin, Bai Lizhen, Shi Xiuwen, and alumna Ms. Lu won the most applause. The new dramas included "Sacrifice," "Temporary Friend," "Tragedy on the Lake," "Absolute Break," and "Suzhou Night Talk," advocating male rights, with "Suzhou Night Talk" being the most brilliant. At the painful parts of the performance, many viewers had tears in their eyes, and even the author could not bear to finish listening. The alumna Ms. Jin Guangmei could not even look up, showing how deeply moved she was. "Advocating Male Rights" was a comedy written by the author, because as a result of advocating women's rights, women's rights have become increasingly important and male rights have become increasingly light. Two hundred years later, it will be the opposite of today's phenomenon, with men becoming slaves to women and being severely abused. Therefore, men plot a revolt in secret and hold a meeting, but it is discovered by women, and each wife reports her husband's ear, which can make the viewers laugh. Because guests were not invited that day, uninvited guests were refused, and armed police were specially invited to guard the gate, so no less than a hundred people from nearby schools who came in high spirits left in disappointment. On this day, the Patriotic Wall Newspaper specially published a commemorative special issue with as many as two hundred pages, about fifty to sixty thousand characters, completely filling the wall, and attached twelve flower and bird paintings by Ms. Wang Mingfen, which were also elegant and pleasing. The author has served at the Patriotic Girls' School and has encountered three commemorative meetings. I respectfully wish this girls' school, which is ten years older than the Republic of China, increasing glory and sharing prosperity with the country, then the author will also share in the honor.</p>
<h3>The Crab Disaster</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>Bi Zhuo, the Personnel Officer of Jin, had the saying, "Holding a wine cup in the right hand and a crab claw in the left hand, floating on a wine boat is enough for a lifetime." The praise for crabs has reached its extreme. Now, the author alone wants to expose its crimes, or perhaps will be accused of being unreasonable because of this. However, if readers can benefit from this in the slightest, then that is my greatest wish.</p>
<p>Venerating Women. My relative, Madam Shen, suddenly suffered from abdominal pain one evening, and it gradually improved after four days and nights. It is said that the pain was very severe, like giving birth to a child. However, the cause of this was not only unknown to the patient, but even the doctor had no definite diagnosis. After a few more days, Ms. Zhu came as a guest and asked in surprise why Madam was ill. Madam replied that she had suffered from a strange disease. Ms. Zhu asked again for details and exclaimed, "If you ate crabs during your period, then it is the crab's fault." It turns out that the tenant in my family's厢楼楼 ate crabs when her period came, and that night, she suffered from severe abdominal pain, which only subsided after three or four days. Madam suddenly realized, "Could it be that my illness is also because of this?"</p>
<p>Killing Old Partners. A person from the countryside once told me that a diarrhea epidemic was prevalent in Puyuan Town at the end of last month, all caused by eating drunken crabs. A 58-year-old man surnamed Huai, who worked in a used clothing store, bought and ate drunken crabs, and that night, he had diarrhea thirty or forty times, and the next morning, he died. Initially, the old man Huai was talking and laughing happily after a full meal, but he never expected to lose his life because of the crabs. Therefore, the Jiaxing authorities temporarily banned the sale of drunken crabs, and those who sold them privately were given a light punishment. The narrator also said that he still remembered ten years ago, a town in the northern countryside of Jiaxing also caused a disease due to crabs, and both a relative and a friend suffered from the disaster. However, the author believes that drunken crabs cause illness or even death because the crabs happen to be sick or there are flaws in the drunkenness. It is not that all drunken crabs can harm people. Readers are wise and will definitely understand this.</p>
<p>Devouring Rice. Ancient records have the term "crab disaster," which refers to the harm that crabs do to crops in the fields. The Pingjiang Records says, "In the Dading Dingwei period, the crab disaster in Wuzhong was like locusts, filling the fields and devouring all the rice." Dading Dingwei was the eleventh year of the reign of Emperor Chengzong Temuer of the Yuan Dynasty, which was 623 years ago. Also, today's coastal areas are mostly inhabited by pengqi, which are similar to crabs. They burrow into the ground and damage dikes, which are also a major enemy of farmers.</p>
<p>Short News. The painter Wang Yachen and his wife, Ms. Rong Junli, have returned to China for more than a month. Li Shizeng, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfu, Jiang Menglin, and the Shanghai Institute of Literature and Art have initiated a painting exhibition at the China Club at No. 150 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai, starting on the 5th of this month and continuing for fourteen days. The exhibition will be held in eight rooms and will be divided into two types: original creations and reproductions of famous European works from various eras. All are welcome to visit without tickets. It is also said that exquisite catalogs will be distributed to visitors.</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (92)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>From observing this, one can understand that Burma was once a tributary state of our dynasties, lost only for a few decades. Therefore, although the Burmese are not entirely in harmony with the Chinese, they are generally better than the treacherous English. Regarding political, geographical, and historical traces, Master Daogai traveled throughout Burma for one or two years and has notes that are of great evidentiary value. The northeastern border of Burma is at the confluence of Simao and Tengyue in Yunnan, bordering India and near Bhutan. If China unites and expands outward with the people of Guangxi and Yunnan, assisting the independence of Annam and Burma from French and English control, it would be a major issue. There are already many Chinese within Siam, Burma, and Annam. Half of the Siamese people have already mixed with the Chinese. The Siamese ruler also acknowledges that the expansion of the Chinese ethnic group's influence in Southeast Asia and the Asian Southeast is only a matter of time, and its potential has already been consolidated. It is a pity that the Chinese do not emphasize self-governance, lack connection, and have too small a vision. In the past, Annam paid tribute to us every two years, Siam every three years, and Burma every ten years. Now that external shackles have been completely removed and internal chaos is rampant, it is truly regrettable that the people do not quickly unite on economic self-governance to become powerful in East Asia. When talking with Burmese gentlemen, their hopes are deeply placed on us, and I am very grateful for their righteousness. Fifty miles away from Rangoon, there is a place called Pegu, said to be where Zhuge Liang arrived when he captured Meng Huo. The Burmese still worship Zhuge Liang today.</p>
<p>The soil of Burma is thick and fertile, originally the richest in the world. Its rice grains are long and fragrant. Master Daofa traveled throughout Burma and observed in great detail. He says there is a type of rice with four hundred grains per stalk. Someone ate rice in central Burma and said there was something special about it, and it was once presented as tribute to the king, truly the finest rice in the world. It yields multiple harvests a year and produces precious stones, pearls, jade, and teak wood. After the English obtained the land, they levied tens of millions in tax from Burma annually to be paid to England, provided 20 million as a subsidy to India, and used 40 million to govern the Burmese province. In total it collected 90 million, and various businesses absorbed its essence abroad, hence Burma is poor. The Burmese resent the English and therefore also resent the various overseas Chinese who trade with them. They have never ceased to harbor the sentiment of the Boxer Rebellion to eliminate them all in one fell swoop, but they lack the strength. As for why they demand separate governance from India, it is because they do not understand the 20 million going to India. However, the English are also very happy for Burma and India to separate governance because they fear that they will conspire to plot against us and unite in resistance, so they use many methods to cause division.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (330)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cordial Inquiry for Characters, Emerald Sleeves Visit the Teacher; Generous Discussion of Military Affairs, Brothel Banquet with Heroic Women</p>
<p>A-Su said, “I think in summer, it doesn’t matter. We are used to wearing slippers barefoot in hot weather. But in winter, even though we still wear very thin silk stockings, the shoes outside are still velvet-faced and lined with felt. Taking off our shoes and walking on the cold, icy floor, we naturally feel unaccustomed. And there are some people who don’t really want people to see their feet.” As she spoke, she pointed to Luyi, saying, “Like our sister here, she also has natural feet that haven’t been bound. But when she washes her feet, she still closes the door of the small room and doesn’t allow anyone to enter.” Luyi and Zuo Shichen were originally talking about something, but after hearing A-Su’s words, she turned her head and said, “Sister, how can you talk about washing feet on the table?” A-Su laughed and said, “Fourth Young Master and Second Young Master are all family, what’s so important about talking about it?” Long Ziyun said, “You two sisters need to balance things out a bit. One sister is too talkative, and the other is too quiet.” Lin Fanzhi said, “Just now, they were called a good match.” A-Su said, “It’s good, but it’s a pity that we’ll be splitting up soon.” Zuo Shichen said, “What? Are you not in A-Su’s place next season?” It turned out that Luyi was contracted to A-Su’s mother. Zuo Shichen had known this for a long time. The brothel system in Shanghai, for those girls, besides buying them outright to be slaves, there were also two types of arrangements: debt bondage and seasonal contracts. Debt bondage could last for eight or ten years. Imagine a girl being forced into a brothel at the age of thirteen, and only being able to redeem herself at the age of twenty-three. A woman’s golden years would be completely ruined. Or maybe she would marry someone halfway through, which would be like escaping the fire pit of the brothel, but perhaps she would fall into the fire pit of a family. That was also a common occurrence. In short, the suffering of debt bondage was similar to that of being a slave. As for seasonal contracts, it was just contracting for one or two seasons, almost like a form of employment. The treatment was mostly courteous. After the contract expired, they would still return to their original owner. Moreover, if they were contracted by a young master, they would still return to them. The young master had the intention of Lin Xiangru returning the jade intact to Zhao. There were also many owners who didn’t trust the contractor, fearing that they would entice guests to secretly return to their small rooms every night. Now, hearing A-Su say that she was going to split up with Luyi soon, it must be that the term was up and she was no longer renewing the contract. Zuo Shichen then asked, “Where will you be next season?” But Luyi still looked at A-Su and refused to say. A-Su said, “Let me tell you. Next season, she’ll be opening her own room in Little Flower Garden, named Green Ripple. Sister, do you have a small picture to give to Second Young Master?” Luyi looked very embarrassed and said, “I didn’t bring my small picture.” A-Su said, “Don’t blame her for picking up customers. Where you are, Second Young Master will definitely be able to find you.”</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market, Leaping Like Rabbits and Swooping Like Hawks</h3>
<p>Difficult to Predict After Initial Fall and Subsequent Rise: Yesterday's Gold Market Situation. The situation was chaotic, with initial falls followed by rises, sudden jumps and falls, making it extremely difficult to predict. The overall trend could not be suppressed, with transactions revolving around two to three taels. However, towards the end, the momentum sharpened, with fluctuations of as much as eight taels in half a day. Trading houses were enthusiastic in their buying, such as Yuan Heng, Fu Chang, Xie Yu, and Zhifeng Yong, all aggressively chasing the price. However, the Ningbo banks, such as Tai Chenrun, mostly sold off. Overseas silver markets saw declines in London silver prices, but New York silver prices remained stable, causing gold prices to rapidly decline. However, the market was very chaotic, with prices rising and falling sharply. Later, as foreign exchange rates showed signs of easing and rumors spread about an earthquake in Japan, prices suddenly fell to 607.5 taels. Most foreign exchange rates rebounded by half a point, leading to further fluctuations around 610 taels. Subsequently, as exchange rates strengthened again and local buying became more intense, prices rose steadily, climbing by five taels and breaking through 615 taels. Short sellers panicked and could only cover their positions in the end at around 616 taels. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday market closure, the price fell by ten taels. The opening price for January was 608.7 taels, a decrease of 3.7 taels (the gross spread was around 8 to 10 taels, with buyers dominating). The recent decline in large bars was 1/8 for near-term and 1/16 for far-term, and with no sellers from the United States, sentiment was agitated, leading to a lower opening. Soon after, Yuan Heng, Fuchang, and others rushed to buy, jumping by more than three taels to 12.4 taels. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of one or two taels, but the sentiment was negative. Just over ten minutes later, prices crashed by more than four taels to 607.5 taels at 9:25 AM, with strong selling pressure. Almost simultaneously, the foreign exchange market also weakened. Mitsui bought 1.3 yuan per tael of Japanese gold for the current month, then divided it into 1.25 taels. Afterwards, the current price was only 1.34 taels. When the bill of exchange was announced, Yong Heng, Yuan Heng, Xie Yu, and others bought in, pushing the price back up by two taels to 10.03 to 11 taels. However, the listed exchange rate was increased to 1.25 US dollars, and the 25th Japanese gold fell by 875, which had no impact. The internal market remained stable. Sumitomo absorbed 1.63125 British gold in February. Before long, Dadecheng came to sell, and Korea offered 1.63125 British gold in March, resulting in a drop of two taels. At 9:30, the price was 608.89 taels. Then, Shanghai absorbed 1.6375 in March. The Mack Line bought 37.0625 yuan in US dollars for January. Yuan Heng and others continued to drag in goods on the floor, reaching 11.8 taels around 10:00 AM. After this, the ups and downs were complex, fluctuating by more than one tael. There was a momentary increase in sellers, and Japanese gold was traded among banks for 1.3 yuan in January. By 10:50 AM, it had fallen to 0.098 taels. After 11:00 AM, Zhifeng Yong, Jintai Yong, and Yuan Heng suddenly bought in heavily, so by 11:30 AM, the price was 13.4 taels. In an instant, it shed 1.5 taels to 12 taels. Sentiment was unsettled, and deposits and withdrawals were in disarray.</p>
<p>The evening market rebounded by 3.6 taels. After 1:15 PM, there was a sudden surge, with Zhifeng Yong, Xie Yu, Yuan Da Yong, and others buying aggressively, pushing the price up by more than two taels. Rumors circulated that a certain bank had bought cash, but this was not accurate. It was merely market hype. At the noon close, the price was 615.6 taels, an increase of 3.6 taels compared to the previous day. It then rose again to 16 taels. Market sentiment was extremely strong. The highest price for half a day was 15.6 taels, and the lowest price was 7.5 taels (referring to the listed price), a difference of 8.1 taels. Goods were priced at 8.7 taels in the morning and 16 taels at the noon close. The posted price has been changed to 653.8 taels. The Japanese gold listing has decreased by 875 initially, 43 taels internally later 45 taels was 38 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Transactions between traders were made hastily and hastily withdrawn. Trading was recorded between Yuan Heng, Fu Chang, Xie Yu, Yongfeng, Jin Da Yong, Yong Heng, Yuan Mao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and goods progressed smoothly. Tai Kang Run, Kun He, and Tong Tai Chang etc. are all out Wanxing, Bingxing, Dadecheng and other came in and out for a short time. The Dalian Gang traded a total of 1,500 bars, while taking out 6 or 700 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Weakens Before Strengthening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market saw continued declines in British silver, while US silver remained stable, making the market more calm. Exchange rates rose slightly. HSBC's listed prices suddenly increased by half a point, likely due to the easing market conditions in Shanghai. The British exchange rate rose to 1.125, currently at 1 shilling 6 pence 0.125. US dollars rose by 0.25 to 36.625 yuan. Indian exchange rates increased by 0.75 to 101.75 rupees. French francs increased by 7 yuan to 933 yuan. Japanese yen increased by 0.75 to 91 taels. German exchange rates increased by 1 yuan to 153 marks. Vietnamese exchange rates decreased by 1 tael to 152.25 taels. Hong Kong exchange rates remained unchanged at 80.075 taels. Japanese gold decreased by 875 to 1.35375 taels. The trend of weakness in British, American, and Japanese exchange rates reversed and strengthened, while the gold market saw a morning decline and an afternoon drop. There were fluctuations of as much as eight taels in half a day, creating turbulent conditions that were difficult to manage. However, short sellers still had no way out, and the price was pushed up to between 616 taels. As a result, the exchange rates were finally strong. Compared to the previous day, British gold decreased by 0.0625, US dollars decreased by 0.125, and Japanese gold increased by 0.25, indicating a fluctuating market. It is estimated that Chinese merchants have made large purchases and sales of British gold, but the amount is not large. Banks have shown some buying interest, with Sumitomo, Shanghai Hwab, and others absorbing positions. Korean wheat merchants, Bank of China, and Banque de l'Indochine have sold off positions, with a total transaction volume of over 100,000 pounds. Gold firms have mostly hedged their positions with gold bars, with interbank transactions amounting to tens of thousands of pounds. US dollars have been slightly sold off, with Jardine Matheson absorbing positions. Also, Dalian notes have been sold off by the Dalian Gang, with Japanese banks absorbing positions for hundreds of thousands of yuan. In addition, interbank transactions amount to two or three hundred thousand yuan, but British merchants have shown no buying interest, and market sentiment has improved again. The afternoon market was closed due to the Saturday holiday.</p>
<p>British Exchange Internal Market. The fluctuation was 1.125 taels in a day. In the morning, December was offered at 1 shilling 6 pence 0.25, with a buying price of 3.125.

The gold price turned up at eleven or twelve, and then Mitsui and Yuntong paired up with one hundred thousand yuan at one tael three yuan four coins, and the gold price was reduced to a ten tael. The scene turned tight in the noon, but the transaction was sparse, and the month was 1.3475 yuan at the close, and the month was one tael three yuan half the price of March was one tael three yuan four points and the price was decreased by three yuan. It is still felt that the knot is lacking.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphic news, the decline in large bar silver has not stopped, with the prospect of a catastrophic fall. The near-term decline was 1.125, also retreating into the 16 pence level, with a calculated rate of 15 pence 875 (equivalent to 1 shilling 6 pence 75 in British gold).

<h3>Steady Closing in Silver and Foreign Currency Market</h3>
<p>Market Overview: The silver and foreign currency markets are currently in a winding-down period, and most businesses have come to a standstill. Therefore, the financial community is only receiving and not releasing funds for transactions, resulting in an overabundance of silver and foreign currency, making it difficult for market prices to change direction. However, the rampant rise in coin prices shows no signs of returning to normal.

The stagnation has long been unseen. The result was that the buying situation was lackluster compared to the previous day, and prices fell slightly again. The amount was mostly only around four or five cents. Only the seven-year financial aftermath rose slightly compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>Depressed Yarn and Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak and the downward trend is severe, with the general situation deteriorating. The world situation is not good, the demand for yarn is quiet, and the inventory of Japanese yarn is increasing day by day, making sales sluggish, so the selling price continues to fall. 20-count basket phoenix yarn fell by 1.5 taels, causing panic and increasing selling pressure. New low prices have been discovered in each month, and the future is difficult to determine.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Rises in Morning, Falls in Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, but the trend of US cotton is still weak and there is no sign of recovery. The Ningbo gang aggressively purchased and increased the number of packages, the transaction volume was too large, the source of Hanlu is still scarce, and buyers are tightening and unwilling to let go, so the market is stronger. The current cotton market has been completely stopped, and the mills have not taken any action.</p>
<p>Deterioration of Chinese Standards: The Chinese standard market was strong in the morning due to mixed rise and fall in cotton and the fact that the purchasing situation in Ningbo was tense. Each was raised by one or two coins. In the afternoon, the yarn market fell sharply and cash cotton trades had stopped. The market turned weak and each fell by one or two coins.</p>

<h3>Last Week's American Cotton Remained Mixed</h3>
<p>A report from New York on the 5th stated regarding the cotton market for the week: The cotton market last week rebounded firmly after a slump due to short covering, but the overall trend still lacked reliability. The weekend was relatively quiet, but still mixed. Private cotton production estimates ranged approximately between 1,385,300 bales and 1,469,700 bales, showing no impact on the market. Local traders believed that the government's estimates would have limited changes. Spot demand showed no activity, and the floating supply on the market was still being absorbed by cotton merchants to cover their old debts or sold for forward contracts. Attached are the weekend statistics for American cotton (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Turned Steady</h3>
<p>Except for Thin Rice Turning Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday in Zhabei, the various gangs brought in Forty Number Rice, with inconsistent sales. The Northern Japonica market opened at thirteen yuan eight jiao, with shops keen to stock high-quality goods, so transactions of medium quality were not active. The market was flat, with prices fluctuating by nearly a jiao throughout the day. Thin rice, due to continuous sharp reductions, saw scarce arrivals, leading to active sales and prices generally rising to eleven yuan eight jiao. The Indica market was extremely eager, with a firm situation and a gradual increase of half a chi. Du Indica arrivals were selling normally, trending towards stability like local Indica. The path for exchange was not smooth, and arrivals were not many, so there were no significant fluctuations. Top river stocks remained lacking in the market, continuously opening at around thirteen yuan, with dull exchange and a lack of market prosperity.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai South, about twenty boats of river rice arrived. Sales on the street were sluggish, with various shops marking definite but hidden stagnation. Sales of Chang Gang machine-milled Japonica felt weak, possibly because high-quality goods were scarce. Ordinary high-quality Japonica hovered around the thirteen yuan mark. The overall trend of Suzhou and Tongbai Japonica stabilized, with both arrivals and sales not expanding. Throughout the market, only a few rural villages and shops moved slightly. Market prices were the same as the previous day. Sources of Qing Top and other thin and early rice from the Southern Gang were also scarce here, but base goods remained abundant. Customer gangs showed intention to select high-quality goods, with inquiries stable. Sales of Yang Du Indica were not bad, and goods arrived successively, with no price increase. High-quality Du Top Rice still opened at around twelve yuan, with dull exchange, weak buying interest, and high-quality steady but secondary quality sluggish.</p>
<h3>Hunan Rice Arrivals Increase, Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, customer Indica from the customer gangs still had no solutions. The street continued to have transactions. Overall, 1600-1700 bags were opened, and the market was still lively, but arrivals turned strong yesterday, and sources of Hunan rice increased further. Although the street had intention to purchase, most were pressing prices to buy, so all rice saw a decline. If Xiang rice arrives in large quantities again after this, market prices will have to fall further. The overall market opened with 200 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at a price of eleven yuan two jiao four fen, 200 bags of Nanjing machine-milled rice at a price of nine yuan nine jiao, and 300 bags of coarse rice at a price of eight yuan eight jiao two fen. Over 300 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were priced at eleven yuan one jiao five fen or ten yuan eight jiao, and over 300 bags of Machine Jing Rice were priced at eleven yuan to ten yuan six jiao five fen, and over 300 bags of 砶Jinggang were priced at nine yuan six jiao five fen to nine yuan four jiao five fen.</p>
<h3>Rebound After Frequent Falls in Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The situation for piece goods yesterday was even better. Although sales on the street did not improve, customer sales were still smooth. The Sichuan Gang was still actively buying, and the Hankou, Shashi, Qingdao, and other gangs continued to search and purchase. Therefore, cargo prices rose slightly. The situation for straight tribute satin was even more desperate. Seven Real Pearl now requires two qian seven fen two li ban. Magu and Peacock both have no stock. Mid-range goods only saw Three Friends pattern being sold, opening at two qian nine fen ban. Fine Serge had active searching and purchasing from the Sichuan, Qingdao, and Hankou gangs yesterday, selling out happily at two qian nine fen ban. Huxinting, Tu Moyuan, and Tu Zha Lan opened at three qian one fen, with miscellaneous colors trading at over 200 pieces for three qian. Straight tribute flannel had the strongest price increase due to empty stocks. Three Friends pattern had risen to three qian yesterday. Moganshan rose five li, opening at three qian two fen ban. Hunting Goose Muqiu was three qian three fen two li ban. Santanyinyue, Sima Xiangru, and Shile Bird all had no stock. Crepe flannel, which no one had inquired about before, is now an exceptionally popular item. The Movement Association has already sold it for three qian one fen ban. Huxinting Taoyuan Yi Jun was two qian nine fen, and stock was exceptionally scarce. However, knitwear remained sluggish, with a strong trend to gradually decline.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Needle Eyebrow, and Green Tea Sales Turn Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of foreign firms in this port, such as Needle Eyebrow and Xiumei from the Luxiang tea firm, and green teas from Jinlong and Xiehe firms, all saw active trading. However, selling prices were very low. Zhenmei Pearl Tea and other goods saw slight paths from Yongxing and Dudu foreign firms, but stocks were abundant, making it difficult to reverse the market downturn. After the Russians announced the cessation of Gongxi green tea, people were not shaken. Yesterday, the market plunged five or six liang, and the market situation was very pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Silk Market for Foreign Firms More Difficult to Progress</h3>
<p>The number of overseas silk weaving factories stopping work is increasing daily. No one in this port is asking about raw silk, and silk telegrams are not being transferred. The market atmosphere is becoming increasingly sluggish. Yesterday, only Boxing purchased eight bags of three-star grade coarse yellow silk for the Sichuan factory, with prices generally flat and sluggish.</p>
<h3>Oil Market and A Collection of Oil News</h3>
<p>Zhe Bai oil's price increase is very strong. This year's Hankou market saw petals later, and various gangs consumed special Zhejiang oil to provide support. However, Zhejiang oil production is small, and demand exceeds supply, so the market is rising. Zhejiang Lan oil has already been sold for eighteen yuan eight jiao. Local vehicle oil is twenty-four yuan. The source of Hankou arrivals is scattered. It is said that Jingxin oil may not arrive until the end of the year. The origin of Macheng oil, both new and old, has not arrived. Sources of Interspersed Snow are also scarce. The market is unusually quiet.</p>
<p>The price of Sichuan Gulao oil has fallen seven liang. The sales of Sichuan Gulao oil are still sluggish. Miscellaneous rice in the Hankou market is sold for ninety-seven or eight liang. Yesterday, the Guang Gang in this city opened for sale at one hundred and three liang, a sharp drop of seven liang compared to three days ago.</p>
<p>White Tung Oil is soaring. Foreign firms continue to sell it. Shenglilai Foreign Firm purchased fifty tons at ten to seventeen liang two qian. Domestic prices also rose four qian, with Chunyuan brand priced at fifteen liang four qian and Shenchang brand priced at fifteen liang. Customer goods are still scarce. Xiangxiang opened at fifteen liang eight qian, and Zhilou has not been seen in the market for a long time, now opening at fifteen liang four qian.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Market Prices Turn Slack</h3>
<p>Recently, Sichuan pickled mustard tubers have turned dull due to sluggish sales, and prices are gradually easing. Checks show that the market stock is approximately 4,000 loose [units]. Customer prices recently opened at 32 yuan, and each company's purchasing appetite is not high, with a flat trend. The largest customer sales are from gangs in Tianjin, Guangdong, Shantou, and other places. Although there are currently some purchases, the number is not large. The inland river on this street feels even more sporadic. Yesterday, the top Zhuang called for sales at thirty-one or two yuan, and the second Zhuang sold at thirty yuan to twenty-nine yuan.</p>

<h3>French Student Zou Fusong Discovers Salt to Treat Skin Diseases and Electricity to Raise Fish and Plant</h3>
<p>Seawater Fish Can Become Freshwater Fish</p>
<p>French student Zou Fusong conducted experiments at the Saint-Louis National Hospital in Paris to treat skin diseases with salt and found remarkable results. He found it effective for severe scrotal eczema that caused unbearable itching, for which Westerners' medicines were ineffective. After repeated experiments, Zou first washed the area with hot water for half a minute, then rubbed it with fine salt without any pain. Then, he washed it clean with hot water and rubbed it with fine salt again. He did this two or three times for a total of about five or six minutes. After that, he washed it clean with hot water and wiped it dry. He could do this continuously for three days (only once a day). This method is very simple and painless. It does not require electricity or medicine. Mild cases can be cured once or twice, and severe cases, even old diseases of more than ten years, will definitely be completely cured three or four times. This method can also be used for people without skin diseases. The entire scrotum can be rubbed with fine salt and hot water according to the method to cause heat and increase blood flow. Anyone, especially athletes or those returning from long journeys and feeling tired, can benefit from this method.</p>
<p>According to Zou's research, for all ringworm and any skin diseases on the whole body, after rubbing, washing, and drying with the above method, the area should be rubbed with a purple electric light emitter for about ten to fifteen minutes (depending on the size of the area). Ringworm on the scrotum does not need electricity. After using the method, the whole body heals quickly and the mind is clear.</p>
<p>Zou also has new inventions regarding raising fish with electricity, planting with electricity (motors), turning seawater fish into freshwater fish, turning freshwater fish into seawater fish, and various agricultural science inventions. Zou will also send these for publication and announce them to various countries in Paris.</p>
<p>The director and physicians of the Saint-Louis National Hospital in France are very satisfied with Zou's recent inventions and improvements and have applied the methods. The French in Paris said that Japan has Zou. Zou replied that he is Chinese, but Westerners said that China does not have this kind of science, and they ultimately did not believe it. Now they are gradually believing it and will be faster. Zou is scheduled to return to China in early December.</p>
<h3>About the Fudan Xisheng Society</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>This semester, Fudan's well-known wall newspaper tide has surged like waves again. Since the beginning of the semester, nearly a dozen wall newspapers such as Shortwave Radio, Purple Dove, Minchao, Brilliant, and Anti-Dawn have been published. Among them, the most colorful and the most noteworthy for the authorities is the Xisheng Society's (Xisheng), which is published on schedule and has never been delayed. It is published every three days and its content is extremely rich. It has accurate commentary, interesting East Palace Chronicles, agile news about the school authorities, and rigorous critical writing. Because its most successful step is to estimate the decline of proletarian literature based on the future trend and objective needs of the Chinese literary world, and to analyze the inside story of proletarian writers with precise eyes. These, since being published on Xisheng, have aroused the sympathy of the general students. From this, it can be seen that proletarian literature has only a very short history in the Chinese literary world and then comes to an end, which is also an inevitable phenomenon. The reason why the Xisheng wall newspaper can become the most powerful in Fudan is also because of this reason.</p>
<p>We have to put Shortwave Radio first as the oldest wall newspaper in Fudan. Its news is very well-informed, because before the Fudan Five-Day Journal had been published, it had already been revealed on this radio. Therefore, students with general curiosity welcome it very much. Before each issue is published, there must be many male and female students clustered together to look at it. Especially the young ladies who are a little prominent in the East Palace often squeeze in shyly. What they are most afraid of is that the secrets of their spring love will be revealed by the newspaper. On the male student side, this news is most welcomed, which is also an inevitable phenomenon. Recently, this oldest Shortwave Radio has been delayed in publishing for some reason, and many of its fresh news have been interviewed by the Xisheng wall newspaper that rose later. For example, the resolution of the Fudan board of directors this time. Before it was announced, the school authorities were extremely secretive, but the X issue of the Xisheng wall newspaper was published on</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>That day, the news had been disclosed very accurately. As a result, there was not a single student who did not admire Xisheng. Also, since Xisheng published a rigorous analysis of the inside story of proletarian writers, it has aroused the response of other wall newspapers. This also has to be attributed to the efforts of Xisheng.</p>
<p>The East Palace Chronicles is A Fang's masterpiece. It is very moving to reveal it on schedule. According to A Cai, for this (East Palace Chronicles), I don't know how many storms have been caused. Today, Ms. A personally writes a letter to declare, and tomorrow, Ms. B sends a book to question. Sometimes, there are also unsigned ladies who send a blank note through the East Palace maid to joke. There are really a lot of such romantic notes in A Fang's drawer, making people envious. It's a pity that it's not a love letter, otherwise, if it were published, A Fang could get considerable remuneration because he actually spent a lot of effort writing this (East Palace Chronicles). However, A Fang also has many things to be comforted by, that is, the great reputation of (East Palace Reporter) that he bears has not only caused a sensation throughout Fudan, even the palace masters of various palaces at sea have not heard his great name and have been overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The Xisheng wall newspaper has made many contributions this semester. Based on the wall newspapers of the entire Fudan school, its achievements account for the top. This can also be said to be the unanimous praise of Fudan students. There are more than a dozen members of the society, but their names are kept secret. It's really a medicine in a silent gourd, and I don't know when they will be willing to announce it. However, they can have such a spirit to run a wall newspaper, and they can achieve such excellent results in a very short period of time. It is really worth envying outsiders.</p>
<p>The school is about to give a holiday, and the students are actively preparing for the semester exam. Therefore, the members of the Xisheng Society held a tea party at 7 pm last night (Wednesday). There were eighteen attendees. Huang Huanruo reported on the establishment and work of the society. Secondly, Diao Shenghe reported that the editing policy was eloquent and very moving. Finally, the specific plan for the next semester was discussed, and the result was very satisfactory. Li Jushi was elected as the preparation committee to plan everything during the winter vacation so that the first tea party can be held next year when school starts and continue to discuss and actively proceed. It was also decided to widely recruit members who have the same purpose as the society to strengthen the development of the society. Within a considerable range, it is planned to publish a ten-day journal dedicated to members to publish their research on literary and artistic insights. As a result, the Xisheng Society next year will definitely have a new atmosphere.</p>
<p>The entertainment was A Fang's report on the lustful history of the East Palace, which was very interesting and caused the members sitting to laugh. It is a pity that A Fang will wear a bachelor's hat this semester. I don't know who will take over the East Palace Chronicles next year. This makes me very worried. Although the society is full of talents, only A Fang can be qualified for the position of East Palace reporter. This is what everyone agrees on, right?</p>
<p>Friends, wait and see, please look forward to the new look of the Xisheng wall newspaper next year.</p>
<h3>Reading "Manshu's Spring Dream"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Feng</p>
<p>Modern West Lake is like a modern girl—although her hair is black and her eyes are as bright as paint and she has not lost her Chinese flavor, she also has high-heeled leather shoes and a short skirt. Modern West Lake is foreign houses, roads, cars, and speedboats, no longer the ancient costume of Xizi. But in the shade of Gushan, facing the smoke on a lotus pond, the trees are lush, the birds sing in unison, the clusters are messy, and wildflowers are everywhere. It is still as quiet as the Land of Peach Blossoms in troubled times and has not been affected by the times at all. It is in this place that our unparalleled talented person, Su Manshu, is buried. Manshu is living in seclusion in this place, living in seclusion in this place forever. The cuckoo on the branch, the cricket in the grass, the bright moon in the mountain, and the clear breeze on the lake are his most beloved. He did not die mediocrely like the monks called him a wonderful person. He escaped from the human world that was incompatible with him, escaped from the utilitarian and vulgar monastery, and took refuge in his own field. If you don't believe it, go ask the cuckoo on the bodhi tree that shades his soil, he will tell you the news of our poet.</p>
<p>One day, a red-eyed poet came to the lake. His eyes were reddened by tears, alcohol, and candy. He stumbled to the lake and listened to the news of Manshu from the cuckoo. He often lay alone in the empty mountains under a bodhi tree, with Manshu's tomb as a pillow, shedding tears, tears first reaching under the yellow earth and dissolving with Manshu's poetic bones. From then on, in addition to the clear breeze, bright moon, cricket, and cuckoo, Manshu had one more confidant. Our poet Yan Meng became Manshu's confidant. Although Manshu could not face him and chew on the camellia that the woman he loved most, this was a regrettable thing.</p>
<p>The two of them are from the same hometown, have the same experiences, and have the same personalities. When Manshu was having a spring dream in the tomb, Yan Meng was having a spring dream in the world. Or it can be said that Manshu's incarnation was continuing to have the spring dream in the world. The pitiful Yan Meng wrote his poetic drama (Manshu's Spring Dream) with his bitter tears, line by line, following the jump of his heart. It is warm, bitter, and overflowing with true emotions everywhere. Yan Meng is simply a stubborn beggar. He is now stretching out his poetic palm to ask for human sympathy. Mr. Liu Yazi (hopes to revive Manshu's temperament and pass it down with Mr. Yan (Meng)'s romantic poetic talent). Now Mr. Liu should be weeping with old tears and seeing his old friend Manshu resurrected in front of his eyes in the tears.</p>
