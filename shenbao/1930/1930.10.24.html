<p>各國對於爲公共事業而犧牲之人必鄭重而加以優禮决不等閑視之如前次英飛船失事無論與其事有關係與無關係之人本國與非本國之人無一不深加惋惜其調查也十分審愼其行葬禮也十分尊敬其消息之遍傅於四方也一載再載而不已此其重視爲何如耶及近日又有德國礦内發生炸爆之事被掩没於礦中者有二百餘人之多其營救之力無可言喻雖甚危險而自行投效帮助施救者實繁有徒此其愛護犧牲於公共事業者之熱情爲何如耶</p>

<h3>中國女子體育</h3>
<p>曁南大學體育部主任（三）</p>
<p>陳掌諤</p>
<p>第一爲人類健康和幸福</p>
<p>第二爲保守人類原有的體格和本能</p>
<p>第三爲進取人類一切能力</p>
<p>總上三者而説就是體育衛生與敎育并合以保衛健康和養成道德爲最後的目的</p>
<p>體育與人生的結果目下請略舉一二再加説明云</p>
<p>（一）感覺靈敏俗語説得着三歲成根百歲調老簡單説起來就是凡訓練何種學業一定要兒童的時候入手較爲容易　在體育館中二個十二歲童子加入籃球同時一個四十歲的中年亦加入這一位的幼年的兒童和一位中年的老人同時是第一次練習籃球戱在最初的時候兩位接球傅球投球完全不懂的球來時兩位不但不會接球且怕得很大有應接不暇的様子舉動失常這兩位繼續練習兩個月以後經過細詳考察兩位的成續結局那位兒童對於接球傅球投球進步非常的快實在可以警怕同時那位中年的人絲毫没有進步每逢球來的時候手足忙亂因爲他神經和肌肉完全不會合作和不靈敏由此看來就可曉得體育上的效果會給感覺靈敏</p>
<p>（二）姿勢和健康姿勢和健康兩事頗有趣味不煩來説明幾句老實話現在我們中國學校裡頭設有柔軟體操或德國式瑞典式的體操及各種運動此種操練的目的就是要改正不良的體格</p>
<p>和增進健康體育和健康美國硆佛大學馬蘭博士是著名體育大家對於體育是否可以增進健康和壽命他研究極有心得一九零二年馬蘭博士研究該校泛舟運動員於一百二十三人中二人得了心病身亡八人爲國犧牲二十八人爲萬國著名人物八人爲美國聲望昭著的人物其餘七十餘人爲成功的商人照這樣的調查不但對於壽命有關即是個人前途的事業和個人的幸　亦有密切關係</p>
<p>（三）養成習慣我們現時校内課程所定的朝操晚操柔軟操及課餘運動年季運動會都是爲養成種種工作的習慣從前英國大將威靈頓做學生時代好戱足球每年各校開足球比賽大會威靈頓就做了該校的得力選手但是屢次水賽竟屢次失敗威靈頓雖是遭了多次失敗的痛苦但是仍不灰心照舊拚命去奮門後來到了要卒業的時候就是他最後足球的會期所以他就立誓起來如果今年不戰勝敵人就不取文憑至比賽足球大會開始比賽威靈頓仍舊拚命奮門賽會結局評判員宣布威靈頓的勝利威靈頓的得最後勝利實由習慣裡邊養成的後來威靈頓做了英國的大將常領兵百萬與拿破倫大戰屢戰屢敗最後的滑鐵盧一戰英名蓋世的拿破倫竟被囚了威靈頓得奏凯旋的歌他的毅力實在由學校練習得來的體育足以養成習慣爲他日的奮門成功之母這句話實在是不錯</p>

<h3>風流交涉中</h3>
<h3>一塲嚇詐官司</h3>
<p>前雲飛職員唐月青</p>
<p>與羅玉英結不解綠</p>
<p>旅館中有人挺身出</p>
<p>嚇詐鉅金被拘入官</p>
<p>住居虹口百老匯路四百十二號門牌之甬婦羅王氏年逾不惑有幼女名玉英（又名林妹）年華雙十貌頗娟秀業已許字與某姓本年五六月間羅女忽與唐月青結不解綠唐年二十九歲昔在雲飛汽車行辦事現方賦閑自與女相暱後時赴女家密談兩情　綣情愛彌篤於是女遂失身於唐從此白璧有瑕乃母雖明知其事然以木巳成舟且抱家醜不宜外掦主義故隠忍之間或略加訓責本月十七號玉英與姊及母忽起口角嗣席捲洋二百五十元潛行出外經羅王氏得悉分投華租各界官廳報告謂其女</p>
<p>被唐月青誘拐請爲查究但玉英自出走後先往法租界西新橋街中法鐘表店樓上唐之友人處與唐會晤遂同宿一青翌晨玉英即離唐而至小姊妹處暫居直至二十一號玉英復約唐同至派克路福來機器廠樓上姨母處晚膳畢出外因見有</p>
<p>多人跟隨於後欲思避之遂同至浙江路八百十號蘇州旅館開十九號房間時巳鐘鳴十一下坐未片刻即聞叩門聲玉英乃往開門忽見其母羅王氏兄羅玉卿及不識者男女十餘人蜂擁而入玉卿當將乃妹責打數下而其餘之人即將唐及女看守其時有</p>
<p>一人從人羣中突出自言汪姓名竹清向唐謂此事如欲了結須出洋四五百尊唐以無此巨欵不能應允談判至十二時尙無結果汪等遂將唐及玉英軋至法租界愛多亞路南京旅館羅王氏母子亦同往當被將唐看守於二樓二十三號房間而另置女於三樓某號房間由二女看守而汪忽改變言詞謂唐曰現須　　汝出洋一千元了結此事玉英可由汝領去但最低限度亦須七百元唐無法籌欵被看守一夜翌晨唐以電話致環龍路雲飛汽車行友人王祥官請代爲設法王接電後即往法捕房報告由捕頭飭派探員前往調查被衆所悉乃作鳥獸散而</p>
<p>唐亦乘𨻶逃出及探員入房遍�</p>
<p>覔唐不得祇將玉英尋獲帶回捕房但唐月青自至南京旅館後即折入公共租界龍門路偶一回首忽見汪竹清及其夥康家炳緊趕來唐乃飛逃至大沽路遠東飯店門首被汪等追獲互相爭吵時適有華探邱思九及五六一號印捕到來將唐汪康三人一併帶入老閘捕房捕頭詰悉前情以汪康二人</p>
<p>實有索詐行爲飭令收押並由邱探至法捕房將玉英與羅王氏移提併予暫留昨晨解送特區地方法院刑一庭由刑庭長許家栻君與徐枚檢察官升座提訊捕房律師汝葆彝起稱捕房現暫以刑法三百七十條第三項</p>
<p>詐欺取財未遂罪控訴汪康兩被告但審問後如三七○條不能包括其犯罪行爲則當另行加控遂將案情詳爲陳述並稱今有三點應請注意（一）汪未得租界當局之許可能否在租界内拘捕人犯（二）江以平民資格能否向人索詐錢財（三）康犯係一探夥可否加入捕人今日人證均巳到庭請庭長訊問即由唐月青供稱與羅女結識係友人所介紹我亦時至其家前晚之事</p>
<p>汪康二人皆在塲索欵之語係汪對我言者繼由羅玉英供當時我被人看守於牀上故詐財之事並未聽見云云羅王氏羅玉卿供詞含糊玉卿祇稱我當時向唐云今妹已爲汝所污彼之夫家必不願再娶汝可以</p>
<p>正當手續迎娶並無令汪索詐巨欵之事又由蘇州旅館茶役徐阿根證明當時汪康二人在塲詰之二被告均否認與唐索詐欵項惟稱</p>
<p>曾到南京旅館並延范剛律師代辯捕房汝葆彝律師復稱本案告訴人唐月青及羅玉英羅王氏捕房因恐無法找尋故均暫覊捕房現請庭長詢問羅王氏是否尙須於地方法院訴唐若仍須控訴請着唐交保否則則請裁　云云遂據羅王氏稱此種</p>
<p>家醜不宜外揚故不再起訴許庭長核供遂諭本案改期再訊兩被告還押唐月羅王氏羅玉英飭回下次庭訊時仍須到庭</p>

<h3>羅馬美術考察記（四）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>拉飛爾墓之上部原有二像右首拉飛爾左首是其愛人後被拿破崙取去至今尙缺其一墓之構造有一種均衡的美石棺一具置於其像下方正間之穴中可以窺見棺之正面游人對此墓較其他敎皇者尤爲尊重緣歐人對畫家拉飛爾之事蹟皆能道之</p>
<p>此祠造於耶穌降生前二十七年爲羅馬現今存在之大建築中之最古者當五百年前造聖彼得敎堂時米葛朗極羅即按照此堂之頂所設計者巴黎之彭得翁亦仿此式故此祠在羅馬古建築上極有價値參觀此堂後再在近傍看米葛朗極羅的名雕摩西Moses巨像</p>
<p>摩西像在彼愛脱羅Pietro敎堂内此像雕刻之精爲米氏一生得意之作他雕此像曾研究過五年希臘名雕原物高一丈二尺肌肉及衣褶的表現十分深刻摩西像之上部還有三像係後米氏一百餘年之作相比之餘覺摩西像更爲雄壯其後雕者遠不及米氏之物也</p>
<p>（一）加比多利尼Capitoline敎堂此堂在十三世紀曾毀於火十五世紀初期由米葛朗極羅所重建分左右二所現已改爲古物陳列館館外中央一大廣塲塲中有古代騎馬銅像一座該像是近代盛行銅像之原祖在後雕的騎馬銅像都受此像的影　而塑造的原作塗金惟有許多部分已經剥落古色斑爛其姿勢亦極自然右館陳列希臘名雕共二十六室係意國現任首相莫索利尼所集成者所以陳列這個希臘雕刻的部分就呌莫索利尼美術館意國近八年以來對於美術更加整理保存方面亦很有秩序從去年起公共博物館都廢除門券實行開放使各國人　而往游左館陳列歷史上之名作中有一個（哺兩兒的牝狼）銅像這是記述羅馬發祥祖雙生兒由牝狼餵育的故事據説是紀元前六世紀由希臘輪入下面兩個小孩是後來補加的這雖不是純粹的羅馬藝術然精悍勁烈的狼的姿勢頗可象微古羅馬的國民性此像意國人到處拿來做商標在意大利境内常常可以看到在該館出口處現在尙蓄二狼游者至此更能喚起那個雕刻品的回憶</p>

<h3>最近的德國文壇湯麥斯曼生活之一頁</h3>
<p>— 曼如</p>
<p>柏林著名的書店費虚（Fischer）已經宣佈將在今年秋季間出版一部有趣味的新書而且已經在它所發行的Nesse　Rundschau雜誌底六月號裏登出了此書底一部份作爲樣本但這一叚的樣本其本身却實在是一篇完全的傑作這就是德國的諾貝爾獎得者湯麥斯曼傅記中的三十二頁的一章是取自曼底自傅的費虚書店所宣告將在秋季出版的即是這部書</p>
<p>這是不錯的湯麥斯曼底自傅當然是一部有趣味的書曼底作品向來是説話極有分寸絕不露出本人底面目的所以從他的作品我們很難看出作者本人底影子而我們如果要知道曼本人的話他的自傅當然是唯人的資料了現在在他的自傅裏湯麥斯曼破題兒第一遭地赤裸裸的暴露了他的心靈和情緒底深處他簡明地摭述了他的幸福和痛苦他的叙述是很沉靜的但這顯然很沉靜的叙述却深切地打動了我們而且我們吃驚地看到他的那些親切的體騐有多少是藏匿在他那些客觀地正式而且毫無抒情意味的説部和小説之下在那冷淡的假面具之下是藏着一幕幕的親愛的家庭生活的他最近所發表的一部作品（梅立渦及魔術家）（Mariound　Der　Zauberer）其中所寫的家族生活雖是寫得純全客觀使讀者在讀的時候完全忘記了作者但其背後似亦不無作者底家庭生活在着</p>
<p>但是在這湯麥斯曼生活之一葉裏最有趣的不是他所告訴我們的外界的事件而是他所説的創造工作中的各時期和觀念之如何形成文章底特殊寫法等他告訴我們他每次着手一部新的作品時總是對自己説這一次是一篇不重要的東西做起來容易而且很快可以做完的了他這樣再三地對自己説以引起自己的勇氣當他開始做Jaukrer　的時候就是這樣可是這部小説他却是寫了十年方才寫好而在這十年的期間他所經過的個人的悲患心靈的掙扎都在客觀之至的文筆下充滿於這部小説裏就連那使書中有些地方情調爲之輕鬆的（幽默）也帶着那在這十年之間横行全世界的死神底氣息</p>
<p>關於這部行將出版的自傅我們所知者大略如此此外湯麥斯曼還告訴我們他現在正寫另外一部書這部書使他走入新的境界他正在寫着一部大規模的神話小説書名將是（雅各及其子）（Jaukob　sefne　Sohne）爲了這一部作品曼特地到巴力斯担和埃及去游歷作實地觀察的工夫以便自己能夠愈益活躍地寫出依色到人民底命運其實呢是連這位向來深長自省工夫的作家也被那驅人去領略異國情調的不可抗的衝動所抓住了</p>
<p>除了湯奇斯曼以外德國還有兩個很重要的作家住在不同的都市裏的却在同一個時候發表了同樣的題材的作品這就是孟列去（Munich）城的約瑟夫普同（Josef　Ponten）和漢堡（Hanburg）城的漢折白倫克（Hans　Priedrieh　Bluncb）普同是在寫着一套的長篇小説總題目是Volk　auf　dem　Wege.　Roman　der　deutschen　Unrube、這部寫德國底不安定的故了第一卷已經出版了書名是（伏爾加伏爾加）（Wolga　wolga）是自成一書的在現在這時候出版這部書正是恰當時會因爲現在德國全國正和伏爾加河區域的德國人表着同情這部書寫得確是强勁有力常常逹到偉大的史詩的境界而且充滿着色彩豐富的冒險事件它説的是德國農民在加薩琳女皇時代移民到俄國去的故事和這些德國人之中的一個回到到今日的德國而如何感到了深切的失望因爲日耳曼民族底精神和理想表現得了分强烈的原故這部小説曾被一部份人稱爲日耳曼人底（依列亞特）和（奥迭賽）這個比喻自然是太厲害了點旦普同底作品將成爲日耳曼民族文學中的近代一大傑作則是無疑的</p>
<p>當南日耳曼的普同寫着北部日耳曼人底故事時北日耳曼的白倫克却也在寫着移居到中美洲的日耳曼人底故事白倫克新近出版的那部題名（佛爾堪之境）（Land　der　Vulkane）的長篇小説就是以熱帶的中亞美利加洲的日耳曼人居留地底生活爲主題的但他這部作品規模非常宏大簡直是一生的事業他是從諸神仍然統治着世界的神話時代起寫出了日耳曼民族底生長和興起的其包涵之廣博結構之繁雜可以想見白倫克能抓住這樣艱巨的題材寫出始終是優美一致的作品眞是不容易得很他最近所出的一部是描寫的現代日耳曼人底奮門掙扎以及種種問題到了本卷日耳曼底殖民們已經成爲有錢的種植園底主人他們已經認這新地是他們的了這些農塲主人之一有一個兒子這青年却是個新人他脱離了他那安適的家庭混入當地人政治爭鬥的旋渦裏後來他聲明放棄了那個應該歸他繼承的農場從新再去建立他的新生活只有一個勇毅的日耳曼少女陪伴着他他們同到一個荒漠去漠中岩都是由火山噴出的所以炎熱異常尙未冷却</p>
<p>普同和白倫克兩人在他們的作品理都寫到日耳曼底女性但兩人底女性觀顯然是不同的所以他們寫出來的女性也是彼此不同的典型在古代犧牲自己妻子是只要安守家中讓男子出去打天下好了普同就以爲女人們應該是這樣的因此他寫給我們看的是舊型的日耳曼的女性</p>
<p>但白倫克寫的却是新型的他寫的是現代的日耳曼少女他告訴我們她們是如何地熱望去分享丈夫底不安定的生活去欣然參加着建設新家庭的辛勞的工作</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十六）住在劇塲内</p>
<p>從睡夢中醒來伸着呵吹實在還想睡一睡</p>
<p>（老王起來吧你看看什麽時候了）</p>
<p>（嗯、管他什麽時候呢等大司務來呌吃午飯就起來好了）胖的老王確不願意起來但是大司務已經在門外呌着了</p>
<p>（十二點鐘已經過了吃飯吧起來吃飯吧）</p>
<p>於是我從床上爬起找水洗面孔漱口老王也搓着眼皮坐起了因爲要吃飯不然他决不肯起來</p>
<p>兩個星期前我遷住到New　Teathre來了於是生活的方式起了大變化差不多整個生活活動的時間要支配到夜裏來而白日却做了睡眠的時間了</p>
<p>在等到大司務在門外催了吃飯之後我和這劇塲裏的一切居住者（這裏面除了職員之外還住有幾家朝鮮人我因爲學院提前做署假所以我閒着因了New　Teather經理謝君的允遷入這裏面居住才嬾嬾地從床上爬起那時太陽已經移過了中天</p>
<p>這家劇院除了放映些低級的國產片外很難得機會遇到較好的片子所以我雖然可以每夜自由地看電影然而我對於該電院每天映些什麽片子我都不知道有時來了較好的片子了老謝他告訴我於是我會走到座中去看一看</p>
<p>這好像做了每夜的必修課了和亞膠沙或是有閒時的老謝穿過一段較靜僻的街走到中央大街去中央大街散步了一趟或兩趟我們會找到金山飯店底下的休息椅上坐下因爲可以聽到上面的音樂這樣我們回來時不能不去看一看東方味的藍眼睛的侍女有時没有錢了但也要在那門口的休息椅上坐一回</p>
<p>這次必有的夜的巡行以後於是他們去鬥牌去我要在屋角的一隅讀一點書也許寫一點文稿劇座中隠約傅來卑劣的技巧的比牙落的聲音</p>
<p>大概每夜要十二點鐘後劇塲内才會結束這時候我們會站立門口來看散戲後的觀衆們走出劇場於是門口的電燈滅我們要准備去吃夜餐</p>
<p>自然吃飯後不能就睡睡眠那們有時我也加入鄰室的鬥牌</p>
<p>樓下的老謝在高唱京劇有時大槪要換眏新片之前他們很忙了停止了鬥牌要去作多量的廣告老王是廣告部主任他忙得喘氣</p>
<p>必然地等東天已漸漸地發白了於是大家才感覺到是睡覺的時候了老王特别要打開窗簾看看他喊道</p>
<p>（天明了睡覺吧）這種話似乎與人類的生活矛盾吧</p>

<p>The Northeast Army Takes Over Zhangjiakou; Shi Yousan Goes to Shenyang to Meet Zhang Xueliang. He Chengjun and He Jian, and Lu Dipin Confer on Pacification Matters in the Three Provinces (See Domestic Important Telegrams). Jewish People Oppose New British Palestine Policy. Egyptian King Approves New Constitution and Election Law (See Foreign Important Telegrams). Central Standing Committee Resolves to Change China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to State-Owned (See Important News). Chairman Chiang Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing (See Local News).</p>
<h3>Domestic Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>[Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi]</p>
<h3>Three-Province Pacification Conference</h3>
<p>Held at the Headquarters of the Three Armies Group</p>
<p>He Jian and Lu Dipin Both Attend</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Pacification Conference was held at the Headquarters of the Three Armies Group at 8 PM on the 23rd. He Jian arrived in Hankou by Kehan aircraft on the morning of the 23rd to attend. Lu Dipin also stayed in Hankou and did not leave. Yang Mianzong, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee, rushed to attend on the 23rd to report on the bandit situation. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun, He Jian, Lu Dipin, Xu Yuanquan, and others attended the Three-Province Pacification Conference. He Chengjun presided, and He Jian and Lu Dipin presented the bandit situation and proposed opinions. The allocation of all troops, the raising of funds, and liaison methods were generally decided. That evening, He Chengjun hosted a banquet for He Jian, Lu Dipin, and others. On the 24th, He Jian and Lu Dipin returned to Hunan and Jiangxi separately. He Chengjun will go to Nanjing with Zhang Guanshi at the beginning of the month to report to Chiang in person. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Li Yunlong's troops departed from Shashi to Dean and Sui County on the 23rd. Yuan Bin's troops arrived in Sha to take over the defense. Li arrived in Hankou on the evening of the 23rd to meet with He Jian. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Lu Dipin returned to Jiangxi on the evening of the 23rd. Yang Mianzong went from Hankou to Hunan. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xia Douyin went to Guangshui on the 23rd to inspect his troops and returned to Hankou on the 24th. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Hankou on the 23rd reported that after Xu Yuanquan arrived in Hankou, he told reporters that during the Yan-Feng rebellion, his troops were ordered to participate in the suppression of the rebellion. After several months, relying on the virtue of the Central Government and the destiny of Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Commander-in-Chief He, the Yan-Feng troops were defeated. He had no merit to speak of. When he was at the front, he repeatedly received reports that bandits and communists were rampant in Hubei, and incidents of murder and arson occurred frequently. He was saddened to hear this. Now that the military affairs of suppressing the rebellion have come to an end, Commander-in-Chief He has transferred him to participate in the suppression of the communists, which is very welcome. He will lead his troops to work hard under the guidance of Commander-in-Chief He to suppress the bandits and secure the people. His troops are now marching on foot from Luoyang to Zhengzhou. After concentrating in Zhengzhou, they can take a car to Hankou. He was originally ordered to defend western Hubei, and it is not known whether there will be any changes until he asks Commander-in-Chief He. (Special telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Will Have</h3>
<h3>The Appointment of Three Supervisors</h3>
<p>Li Mingzhong, Zhang Zhijiang, and Liu Zhenhua</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<h3>German Mine Explosion and British Airship Accident</h3>
<p>All countries must treat with solemnity and courtesy those who sacrifice themselves for public undertakings, and must not treat them lightly. For example, after the British airship accident last time, whether people were related to the incident or not, whether they were from this country or not, everyone deeply regretted it. The investigation was very careful, the funeral was very respectful, and the news spread in all directions again and again. What is the importance of this? And recently, there was an explosion in a German mine, and more than 200 people were buried in the mine. The rescue effort was indescribable. Although it was very dangerous, there were many people who voluntarily joined the rescue. What is the enthusiasm for protecting those who sacrifice themselves for public undertakings?</p>
<p>There must be a reason why public undertakings in Europe and the United States are so developed. Only when everyone values public undertakings can public undertakings progress. Only when everyone values those who sacrifice themselves for public undertakings can those who devote themselves to public undertakings be willing to sacrifice. If no one cares about the interests of those who devote themselves to public undertakings, those who use public undertakings to seek personal gain can live comfortably outside the law, and those who sacrifice themselves for public undertakings are regarded by the people of Qin as being as fat or thin as the people of Yue. Then, how can public undertakings be developed? If one sees profit and seizes it for oneself, and sees harm and avoids it, if it becomes a habit and is regarded as natural, the increasing corruption and decline of public undertakings is self-evident.</p>

<h3>British New Policy in Palestine</h3>
<h3>Eliminating Jewish Restoration</h3>
<p>Jewish Nationalities Are Furious</p>
<p>Advocating Non-Cooperation with Britain</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 22nd: At a rally here today against Britain's new policy in Palestine, the crowd responded with scorn whenever remarks touched upon the British Empire and the Labour government. Dr. Holmes, a pastor of a New York church, spoke the most, known for his anti-British sentiments and close ties with Indian radicals. Holmes advised Palestinian Arabs to adopt Gandhi's passive resistance against Britain. The audience applauded upon hearing this. The New York Times, owned by Jewish leaders in the United States, expressed sympathy for Britain, stating that British Zionism could never adopt high-pressure methods to forcibly impose Jewish dominance in Palestine, which would be unjust. The pulpit paper claimed that Britain had made excessive promises during the Great War, which resulted in unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Jerusalem, 23rd: A protest meeting hosted by the National Jewish People's Executive Committee today passed a resolution strongly criticizing Great Britain's proposed change of policy towards Palestine as inappropriate, stating that Great Britain should not violate its guarantee declaration to the Jewish nation in the Balfour Declaration. In addition, the meeting resolved that the established legislative council was solely to restrain the Jewish people from establishing a nation, so the Jews vowed not to cooperate with it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd: The Jewish National Assembly met today for eight hours and unanimously resolved to petition the British government to refuse to participate in the new legislative assembly or to be involved in the parliamentary system, as this method would be equivalent to stopping the Jews from establishing a nation in Palestine. According to local newspapers, all sectors of the Jewish people are willing to abide by this resolution.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Parliamentary Re-election</h3>
<p>Labour Party Still Holds Most Seats</p>
<p>Roadside News Agency, Norwegian Capital, 23rd: The Norwegian Labour Party lost fifty seats in the general election on Monday but remains the largest party in the new parliament. The number of seats for each party is as follows: Labour Party 47, Conservative and Liberal Parties 44, Radical Party 33, Farmers' Party 25. In this election, the Labour Party's platform included capital tax, complete disarmament, and nationalization of banks. The Labour Party's attitude towards Sovietism does not express the same sympathy as the Communist Party. In the 1927 election, the Labour Party achieved a great victory and formed a government that lasted only half a month due to the joint restraint of other parties. The Central Communist Party held three seats in the last parliament, but now none.</p>

The members of parliament are elected by the people elected in the preliminary election.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 23rd: The situation in this city and other fortresses is extremely tense. Troops are deployed on all major thoroughfares, and soldiers from various camps are concentrated and waiting for orders. This is because the Sleeping Palace announced an improved election order yesterday, dissolving parliament and postponing the new election until after the new election census is completed. According to the new election law, only men over the age of 25 have the right to vote, and women are not allowed to participate. After the issuance of this order, the Wafd and Liberation parties strongly opposed it and vowed to resist it with all their might.</p>
<h3>German Social Democratic Party Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>Denies Contact with Britain Regarding War Debt</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: The Social Democratic Party has formally denied rumors from New York and London that the party has been in secret contact with the British Labour Party regarding the delayed payment of reparations. At the same time, it declared that the party's opposition to modifying the Young Plan is also absolutely untrue, stating that the former rumor was obviously fabricated by someone to arouse international distrust, and the latter rumor was even more ridiculous, probably intended to be used by the National Socialist Party to slander the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: The sudden reappearance of former Prussian Interior Minister Severing in the important position of Interior Minister has been extensively commented on by newspapers of all factions.

<h3>Corruption in Russian Maritime Transport</h3>
<p>Pacific Ocean, Moscow, 22nd: The Business Gazette reports that the allocation and cultivation of the commercial fleet are poor, far inferior to other countries. The loading and unloading of goods on ships is chaotic, and conflicts often arise in the functions and powers of various agencies, resulting in huge waste.

<h3>French Minister of Land Visits Spain</h3>
<p>At the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Planning to Align with Spain</p>
<p>One Theory Related to Treaty Signing</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 23rd: The visit of Minister of Land Maginot to Madrid to meet with King Alfonso of Spain has aroused the attention of political figures. It is rumored that Maginot intends to hold talks with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the country. At a time when the League of Nations in Geneva is preparing to hold a disarmament conference, Maginot's trip is said to be intended to align with Spain so that they can take a unified action at the disarmament conference. In addition, there is another theory that Maginot's trip is to conclude a special treaty with the Spanish government, copying the former Italo-Spanish pact, stipulating that if one of the treaty countries is at war, the other treaty countries must remain neutral.</p>
<h3>Continued News of German Coal Mine Explosion</h3>
<p>Rescue Teams Continue to Bravely Rescue</p>
<p>The Cause of the Disaster Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd: After the explosion in the William Coal Mine in Alsdorf yesterday, a total of 235 bodies have been exhumed. The whereabouts of 21 people are still unknown and are presumed dead.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Anzhen, 22nd: The cause of the tragic explosion in the Alsdorf coal mine has not yet been determined. Although miners who escaped the disaster claimed to have smelled explosives, the board of directors of the mine stated that the explosives depot was still intact. Several experts pointed to the explosion of flammable gas in the mine. The German Evening News, published by the Central Clerical Party, commented on the matter, saying that the loss of countless lives was entirely due to the lack of a second entrance and exit in the mine, resulting in many deaths from suffocation after the openings were closed.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Anzhen, 23rd: According to the latest official report, the number of people killed in the Alsdorf coal mine accident has reached 251. Several miners were rescued last night, all of whom had been trapped in gas-filled caves for fifty hours. Many were barely alive when rescued. It is unknown how many people are still buried in the mine, as the company's office was also looted at the same time, and all records were lost, so there is no way to investigate. Rescue teams are still working hard to rescue, and although the danger is worrying, there are many who voluntarily help with the rescue.</p>

<h3>Central Propaganda Department Receives Press</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department received the press at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. Secretary Zhang Tingxi presided and introduced Ma Chaojun, who had just returned to Nanjing from the north, to report on the details of Feng Yuxiang's rebellion and its failure. He gave a painful and detailed speech on Feng Yuxiang's collusion with all kinds of new and old corrupt and reactionary elements to raise troops and create chaos, violently extorting and trampling on the people of the north, and the course of his military defeat.</p>
<h3>Fujian Punitive Lu Army Launches General Offensive Again</h3>
<p>Xingming's Life Temporarily Preserved</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The joint conference of the Party, government, and military in Fujian recently decided to thoroughly punish Lu. The generals of the east and west route bandit suppression armies immediately went to the front line to deploy. The provincial government then issued an order to launch a general offensive starting on the 10th. The east route army will take Yanping from Shuikou, and the west route army will take Youxi from Datian, advancing together. Liu Heding, commander of the east route army, plans to have Liu Shangzhi's brigade take the front of Shuikou, Gui Zhenyuan's brigade take the left wing of Minqing, and Lin Shouguo's brigade take the right wing of Gutian, with Chen Wantai's brigade as the reserve for the front, Qian Yuguang's brigade joining the right wing, and Zhang Ziming and Chen Heling's regiments joining the left wing. Fang Shengtao, commander of the west route army, returned to his defense from the province and immediately convened a military conference at the Yongchun Military Commissioner's Office, attended by officers of various troops and important officials of the office, to decide on the rear defense. The status quo will be maintained until the military operation is over, and Sun Benrong will be sent to Datian to command the troops between Datian and Dehua to advance towards Youxi. In addition, 300,000 rounds of ammunition were borrowed from Guangdong Province for use in military operations.</p>
<p>After Lu Xingming was arrested on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, the provincial authorities telegraphed an order to send him to the province for disposal. It is now heard that the authorities believe that Lu Xingming is more reasonable among Lu's subordinates. After the January 6th coup, he angrily left Shanghai due to Lu Xingrong's perverse behavior. Since then, he has not been involved in Lu's events. On July 6th, he also expressed dissatisfaction with Lu's attack on the provincial capital. The recent telegram from Lu Xingbang and Xingrong resigning and requesting the provincial government to send personnel to take over the troops also came from Xingming's advice. Moreover, the six people arrested are still in Youxi, and it is a case of throwing stones at one's own feet. A telegram was sent to the National Government to temporarily preserve his life before Lu's troops are resolved. However, the Fujian Northern Province Rescue Association stated that the Lu brothers have occupied northern Fujian for more than ten years and extorted millions of people's wealth. The people have been under their iron heel and there is nothing they can do. Now that Xingming has been arrested, a special request is made to the provincial government to liquidate his property and order all of it to be handed over to compensate the victims.

<h3>Xu Yuanquan Arrives in Hankou from Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Xu Yuanquan, commander-in-chief of the Sixteenth Route and commander of the Forty-eighth Division, led his troops to join the left wing of the Pinghan Line and repeatedly captured Dengfeng, Luoyang, and other places. Now, because his troops have been ordered to be transferred to Hubei, he took a special train south from Zhengzhou on the morning of the 21st. The headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief here received a telegram that evening and immediately notified various agencies and groups to prepare to welcome him. On the morning of the 22nd, the welcoming crowds gathered at the Dazhimen Railway Station, including He Chengjiao, acting director of the headquarters, Chief of Staff Chen Guangzu, Director of the Office Xu Chengxi, Director of the Transportation Department Xu Shaoqiu, Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-first Route Xia Douyin, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Garrison Command Ye Peng, Mayor of Hankou Liu Wendao, Director of the Finance Department Zhang Guanshi, Director of the Construction Department Fang Dazhi, and representatives from various agencies, about several hundred people. The forces responsible for security were the troops of the Garrison Department, the Provincial Government Security Team, the Municipal Public Security Bureau Security Team, the Forty-eighth Division Gendarmerie Battalion, and the military band of the Provincial and Municipal Governments' Third Army Corps Headquarters, all waiting at the station. At 2:00 PM, Xu's special train arrived, accompanied by Xu Jiwu, brigade commander of the Forty-eighth Division, Chief of Staff Yang Shaodong, Secretary Yan Yousan, Staff Officer Zhang Guoquan, and a company of guards, a total of six special trains. After Xu got off the train, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one and then rode in a car with Acting Director He to the headquarters of the Third Army Corps to rest. That evening, He hosted a banquet to welcome him. I visited Xu as soon as he got off the train and asked him about the progress of the troops' operations and future tasks. Xu spoke as follows: (Since Feng Yuxiang and the two rebels betrayed the central government and destroyed peace, causing chaos in the north, our troops were ordered to participate in the punitive expedition, which lasted for several months before the rebel troops were defeated. Our troops initially took charge of the right wing of the Pinghan Line and linked up with the Longhai armies to fight, and then captured Weichuan and Weishi and other places. Later, we were ordered to transfer to the left wing of the Pinghan Line and attack alongside Commander-in-Chief Yang Hucheng. At that time, Song Zheyuan's rebel troops stubbornly defended Luoyang, closing the city and resisting. Our army pursued and directly approached the city, surrounding it on all sides, while launching a fierce attack. We also sent personnel into the city to persuade them to withdraw from Luoyang, fearing that the people would suffer the disaster of artillery fire. On the 17th of this month, the rebel troops did not dare to resist and fled the city, and the remaining troops were completely eliminated. Luoyang was then captured by our army. We were leading the troops westward to directly attack the rebel nest when we suddenly received a telegram from Director He summoning us back to Hubei to discuss bandit suppression. Therefore, we first led the main personnel of the headquarters back to Hankou. The Forty-fourth and Forty-eighth Divisions are now in the vicinity of Mianchi, Xin'an, and Luoyang. One part has already marched to Zhengzhou and is heading to Hankou, while another part is still attacking Tongguan alongside Yang Hucheng's troops. After Tongguan is captured, they will all return to Hankou to take on the task of easing the situation, so that they can fulfill their obligations in their hometown. As for the location of the troops' defense, we were originally ordered to designate the western part of Hubei, but it is still unknown whether there will be any changes now. If we have time in Hankou, we will take the opportunity to go to Nanjing to pay our respects to Commander-in-Chief Chiang.) (October 22nd)</p>
<h3>He Jian Asks</h3>
<h3>To Cancel the Arrest Warrants for Feng Tianzhu and Others</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: During the previous intrusion of Zhang Guitai's army into Hunan, there was no shortage of people in Hunan who sided with them. After He Jian recovered Changsha and drove away Zhang Guitai, he immediately submitted the names of 55 people, including Feng Tianzhu, who were confirmed to have sided with the rebels to the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters to issue arrest warrants and bring them to justice to maintain discipline. Recently, as Zhang Guitai was in dire straits and Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang were defeated, unification was about to be completed, and the military operation was coming to an end. Feng Tianzhu and others have also repented and restrained their actions, or petitioned to surrender and worked hard to eliminate the communists. He Jian, based on Commander-in-Chief Chiang's intention to pardon political prisoners, specially requested Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He to approve the cancellation of the arrest warrants for Feng Tianzhu and others so that they would be grateful and observe the aftereffects. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (During the previous intrusion of Gui and Zhang into Hunan, the entire province was shaken. At that time, in order to suppress the reactionaries and rectify discipline, a telegram was sent on June [blank] to request the arrest of Feng Tianzhu, Zou Pengzhen, Guo Tiean, Xie Guoxin, Jing Siyou, Feng Zhuokui, Lv Mengxiong, Yan Fanggui, Tang Daixingbing, Wang Yi'e, Hu Naian, Xiong Keli, Ouyang Jiu, Chen Fangdu, Yan Changdong, Zheng Changshen, Chen Rong, He Xuan, Tang Zheming, Tang Shengming, Wang Xijiong, Yan Renyi, Li Zemin, He Gan, Tang Xing, Wang Kuang, Pei Yixi Liang, Yang Zhenhua, Fu Dingyi, Yi Weiyang, Qi Changlong, Lei Zeyuan, Li Lixia, Han Hua, Tan Bing, Xu Hanchen, Tang Qingyun, Chen Zongze, Fang Weizhen, Mao Zhenxian, Liang Minjie, Ge Huinan, An Min, and Tang Jihou, etc., who were all elements of the rebel party. In recent days, as Gui and Zhang are in dire straits and Yan and Feng are defeated, the punitive military operation is coming to an end. Feng Tianzhu and others have either become enlightened and restrained their actions or have petitioned to eliminate the communists. Based on the Jiang Dian, I request the pardon of political prisoners to show the central government's leniency and generosity. It is proposed to approve the cancellation of the arrest warrants for Feng Tianzhu and others so that they will be grateful and observe the aftereffects. What is appropriate is subject to your review and instruction. He Jian presented.</p>
<h3>Wang Jinyu Passes Through Jinan from Liaoning to Kaifeng</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Jinyu, director of the Northern Expedition Camp of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters, was ordered by Commander-in-Chief Chiang at the beginning of this month to travel by sea to Liaoning to meet with Zhang Xueliang for negotiations. At that time, Governor Han Fuqu of Shandong Province had invited Wang to meet in Jinan when he arrived in Qingdao. Wang was too eager to go to Liaoning, so he did not come. After Wang arrived in Liaoning, he immediately telegraphed Han to send Wang Fangting, director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, to Liaoning to facilitate all negotiations. Wang Fangting set out from Jinan on the 8th of this month to meet Wang and carried a personal letter from Han to Zhang Xueliang. The two Wang had already met in Liaoning. Wang Jinyu, with his task completed, took a special train back south from Liaoning on the 19th and arrived in Jinan at 12:00 AM. Because it was nighttime, no one was at the station to welcome him. After Wang got off the train, he went to</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Jin-yu Arrives at Jinan and Proceeds to Kaifeng</p>
<p>After alighting at the Jinan Hotel at approximately 10:00 AM, Wang Jin-yu went to the provincial government to meet Han Fu-qu. Han then held a banquet at the headquarters to welcome Wang. The special train Wang arrived on consisted of two carriages, specifically the Ping-Sui locomotive number 324 and a first-class Jin-Pu carriage number 202. Because the rights on the Jin-Pu Railway have not yet been unified, the carriage was immediately returned to Tianjin. Han Fu-qu immediately ordered his personal, frequently used special carriage to be prepared and sent to Wang. At 2:00 PM, Wang hurriedly boarded the train for Kaifeng. Those who came to the station to see him off included Li Shu-chun, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Han Fu-qu’s wife. According to Wang Jin-yu, the results of this trip to see Director Zhang in Liaoning were quite satisfactory. He himself has been newly appointed as the Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, and since his Ninth Army is still in the Zhengzhou-Bian area, he must go there to make arrangements before he can take office in Peiping. Before Wang left, Han Fu-qu also sent his adjutant, Li Guo-an, with ten soldiers to escort the train along the way. (21st)</p>
<h3>Zhan Shu-tang Convenes a Local Pacification Meeting</h3>
<p>Four Resolutions on Local Pacification Methods</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Zhan Shu-tang, the Commander of the 73rd Division and concurrently the Commander of the Bandit Suppression in Jiaodong, along with Chief Advisor Zhao Tong-shan, convened a meeting of representatives from various counties in Jiaodong at the Gaomi County Government at 7:00 AM on the 18th to discuss local pacification. Zhan began by reporting on the general situation, stating that his primary task in Jiaodong was to eliminate banditry and pacify the local area. However, because his division has been fighting for years and has not received adequate training, and because transfers are frequent and equipment is incomplete, he cannot avoid asking for everyone's assistance, for which he is deeply apologetic. Zhao then elaborated on the fact that bandit suppression is a short-term solution, and that the fundamental method is local pacification. He then proposed four local pacification methods: (A) Organize a local pacification general association and sub-associations. (B) Conduct a census. (1) The county magistrate shall instruct the district head, the district head shall instruct the village head, the village head shall instruct the village leader, and the village leader shall instruct the neighborhood head, and a joint guarantee must be provided. (1) The format of the household registration booklet shall be filled out in accordance with the format promulgated by the central government, and the printing and distribution shall be paid for from the local pacification funds. If there are no local pacification funds, each district shall be instructed to raise funds to print and report the booklets according to the format. (C) Report bandits. If village heads, etc., are afraid to report openly for fear of incurring the resentment of bandits, they may secretly mark the registers when filling them out. This mark may be temporarily determined, but must not be used to falsely accuse anyone. If a false accusation is discovered, the accuser shall be punished as if he were the bandit. Anyone who knows about bandits and does not report them shall be punished as if they were colluding with bandits. (D) Inspect firearms. Inspect, mark, and number firearms by district, with a deadline of twenty days for completion. After the inspection, anyone found to have firearms that are not numbered and marked shall be treated as if they were privately possessing military firearms. Also, the local pacification stamp shall use the county seal and not be engraved separately. After the public deliberation of the above four items, a general order was issued.</p>
<p>District, general, and branch associations shall be established uniformly. (October 20th)</p>
<h3>Jiaoji Railway Bureau Hosts Qingdao and Jinan Reporters</h3>
<p>To Visit the Damage to Bridges Along the Railway</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway Management Committee believes that the losses suffered by the railway this year, when it was occupied by war zones, are the greatest since the takeover. Although various newspapers have occasionally reported on this, they have only provided fragmented and incomplete information. Only through on-the-ground investigations by reporters from various newspapers can the truth be clarified. Therefore, it was decided to invite reporters from Qingdao and Jinan to visit the war zone between Gaomi and Xin'an on the 25th of this month. On the evening of the 23rd, a special train was used to pick up the Jinan reporters and take them to Qingdao. A tea party and dinner were held on the 24th. On the 25th, they departed from Qingdao to inspect the area. Because the area west of Xin'an was not affected by the war, the Jinan reporters returned to Jinan after arriving at Xin'an, and the Qingdao reporters returned to Qingdao. The letter from the committee to the various newspapers is recorded below: (The losses suffered by this railway this summer due to the war are the greatest since the takeover. The enemy forces occupied the Zi River, Wei River, and other places, blocking traffic for nearly two months. Not only was there a sharp reduction in passenger and freight traffic revenue, but also the tracks, bridges, and electrical equipment were severely damaged. The direct and indirect losses are incalculable. Although various newspapers have occasionally reported on this, they have only provided fragmented information and not a complete picture. Only through on-the-ground inspections by reporters from various newspapers can the truth be clarified. Therefore, our bureau has formulated a plan to invite reporters from various newspapers on different days. On the evening of the 22nd of this month (Wednesday), a special sleeping car will be attached to the second train for the Jinan reporters to take to Qingdao. They can use this letter to obtain tickets from the Jinan Station. Those who wish to come to Qingdao during the day can take the sixth or fourth train on the same day and use this letter to contact the fourth section of the transportation department to arrange transportation. After arriving in Qingdao, they will be accompanied by a staff member of our bureau to the pre-arranged hotel for rest. At 3:00 PM on the 23rd (Thursday), reporters from Qingdao and Jinan will be invited to our bureau's auditorium for a tea party. A banquet will be held at a selected location that evening. On the 24th (Friday), two passenger cars will be attached to the fifth train for the Qingdao and Jinan reporters to travel along the railway to inspect the damage. At Gaomi Station, the carriages will be detached and pulled by another locomotive to Xinzhuang. Because this section was an important area of combat at the time, the bridges were severely damaged and the train must stop and be inspected frequently. After arriving at Xinzhuang, the carriages will be attached to the third train to Jinan. The Qingdao reporters will stay on the train overnight. On the 25th (Saturday), the original train will be attached to the sixth train to return to Qingdao. Those who wish to stay longer can be provided with additional train tickets. In addition to having staff from our bureau to assist at all times, we hereby inform you accordingly and hope you will take note.)</p>
<h3>Cargo Train on the Yue-Shao Railway Robbed</h3>
<p>Looting of Seven to Eighty Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>Four Merchants Kidnapped Before Leaving</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Yue-Han Railway was renamed the Yue-Shao Railway, traffic has been peaceful. However, on the 17th of this month, the 22nd cargo train, which departed from Huangsha Station in Guangzhou for Shaoguan at 8:00 AM, was suddenly intercepted by bandits at 10:40 AM when it arrived at Shengping Station in Qingyuan, which is located in the middle or upper reaches of the Bei River. A large amount of property was looted and four people were kidnapped. Three bandits disguised as passengers boarded the train at Beijiangkou Station. Shortly after the train departed, as it passed the Shipaikeng reservoir bridge at Shengping Station, the three bandits emerged from the cargo car, crossed to the locomotive, and used pistols to threaten the driver to stop the train immediately. The driver, deprived of his freedom, was forced to comply. Once the cargo train stopped by the trees, about twenty bandits swarmed out and began searching and looting the train. The bandits looted seven to eighty thousand dollars in cash carried by cargo passengers and over ten thousand dollars in freight. Before leaving, they kidnapped four people. Fortunately, the train's machinery was not damaged. According to the report from the section chief of the railway yesterday, the train guard He Ming reported to Yingde that at 10:40 AM on the 17th, the 22nd cargo train was ambushed by more than ten bandits near the Shipaikeng reservoir tree at stake number 2996. Three bandits first climbed onto the locomotive's tender and used guns to intimidate the driver to stop the train. They kidnapped four merchants and looted goods and money. They also looted over seventy dollars in spare funds and two scales from the train guard's car. It is reported that bandits have been rampant in this area for some time. Now they dare to rob trains. How can we quickly find a way to maintain order and restore traffic? After receiving the report, the section chief of the central section, Liu Guo-yang, and the director of the Xiaoyin Railway Bureau immediately dispatched a company of the traffic corps and a company of the salt police corps from headquarters, a total of two hundred men, to Shengping Station on the railway. They disembarked and advanced towards the foothills in order to destroy the bandit lair. (October 18th evening)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang and Huzhou Silk Merchants Petition for Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>Pan Run-sheng, Feng Zuo-lan, and Others Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>The Zhejiang and Huzhou silk merchants elected Pan Run-sheng and Feng Zuo-lan as representatives to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government for a reduction in taxes. The provincial government meeting resolved to reduce the silk tax by one-quarter. The two representatives, Pan and Feng, are scheduled to go to Beijing on the 24th of this month to continue petitioning the Central Party Headquarters and the State Council to reduce or eliminate the silk tax in order to maintain the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers. It is reported that the content of the petition is roughly as follows: It has been found that Wuxing in Zhejiang Province has always produced silk and is the backbone of industry and commerce. More than hundreds of thousands of workers rely on it for their livelihoods. In recent years, machine weaving in the suburbs has been successively shut down, and silk factories in various places have often been reported to have ceased operations. Not only are the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of workers in danger of being completely cut off, but other industries and commerce have also been stagnant as a result. Although the scientific methods of machine weaving have not been able to compete with the novelty of foreign goods, the crux of the matter is actually that the raw materials and products are subject to heavy taxes at every stage. The unevenness of tax treatment has led to increased costs, backward sales, and forced closures. The situation of raw materials and product tax rates is described in detail on the left: (A) Raw materials (1) Local silk from various provinces is mostly purchased from Jintan and Liyang in Jiangsu, and Qingyang and Dai Zhen in Anhui. From the place of origin to Huzhou, each load pays 112.69 yuan in tax, with Jiangsu and Zhejiang taxes accounting for 60% of the total. (2) Mill waste is the central location for silk markets in China through Shanghai. Therefore, even inland silk mills transport and sell mill waste through Shanghai. The ones with tough and supple texture and glossy color are sold to foreign firms, while the others are used by silk merchants for machine use. Each load transported from Shanghai to Huzhou pays 65.6 yuan in tax. Silk is made from cocoons, and cocoons have already been taxed. It seems that there should be no double taxation when they are made into mill waste during a transition. This is still the case for mill waste in Shanghai. If mill waste from Zhejiang Province is transported and sold to the Shanghai market, it will be taxed at the same rate as local silk sold locally, 19.2 yuan, plus an export tax of 34 yuan. If foreign firms in Shanghai have unsold products and transport them back to Zhejiang, it seems that the export tax should be refunded according to the local silk local sales tax rate. However, once it is transshipped, it must still be taxed according to the example of mill waste transported from Shanghai to Zhejiang. Is this not double taxation? (3) Artificial silk. Huzhou silk is originally a pure natural silk fabric. Compared with the shortage of silkworm crops, the villagers compete to sell cocoons, resulting in a shortage of raw materials, and artificial silk is inevitably mixed in. Each box transported from Shanghai to Huzhou pays 49.44 yuan in tax, with Zhejiang tax accounting for 60% of the total. (B) Product Huzhou silk tax rate includes production tax, sales tax, and transit tax. Among them, Huzhou merchants bear a heavier burden on production tax and sales tax, and the treatment is uneven. For example, Ning satin pays 14 cents per catty, Su satin pays 17 cents per catty, Sheng silk pays 20 cents per catty, and Dan crepe pays only 10 cents per catty, all of which are produced and sold simultaneously. Huzhou silk pays both a production tax in Zhejiang and a sales tax in Jiangsu, totaling more than 50 cents per catty, which is a comparison of one to three. Even more strangely, Shanghai silk factories are completely tax-free. Not only the concession but also Minhang and other places in the Chinese territory do not pay taxes. Shanghai is a competitive sales market, and fabrics from all over the world, whether for sale or transshipment, are concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, the sales tax contains the nature of a transit tax, but it is not levied on Jiangsu and Shanghai silk merchants, but is only charged to Huzhou merchants, as if it were specially designed for Huzhou merchants. How can Huzhou silk not fall behind if its circulation is hindered? As for the transit tax, it includes customs duties, surcharges, son-mouth tax, export parcel tax, and destination parcel tax. As soon as the goods move, the tax follows. If the goods arrive in Location A and cannot be sold, and are transshipped to Location B, they must still be taxed the same five taxes as before, and even if they are returned to the place of origin, they cannot be exempted at all. Some goods have been transshipped to several locations and the taxes have been twice as high as the cost. From this point of view, Huzhou merchants bear a heavy burden of taxes, like a dense network, and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang tax on raw materials and the sales tax on products are the most criticized by Huzhou merchants and the main reasons for the decline of Huzhou silk. It is necessary to formulate equal special chapters to reduce or exempt the heavy tax rates in order to save the dying machines and maintain the declining national products.)</p>

<p>Performing Plays to Comfort the County's Agencies. Because General Commander Chiang Kai-shek defeated the warlords in this campaign, plays were performed for five days starting on October 17th to comfort the soldiers at the front. All affairs were managed by the Finance Bureau, and ticket sales were excellent, with daily revenues of three to four hundred yuan. On the evening of the 21st, Finance Director Canghai Ke made a guest appearance in the play "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao", which was greatly applauded by the audience. However, after the county police team and the public security team were transferred back from Lvxiang, where they had been stationed due to repeated robberies, to protect the theater, the people of Lvxiang were panicked, thinking that the troops had been withdrawn. Merchants and residents moved away, and the people of the southern township lived in dire straits without any protection. It is hoped that party and government officials will provide assistance and not turn a blind eye.</p>

<p>Ancestral Hall Robbery Injures Person. At around 11:00 PM on the 20th, the home of Wu Qiushan, a resident of Miaojing, Tailu Tu, Chenjiahang Township, was broken into by a group of bandits, about twenty in number, speaking in local accents and carrying firearms and iron rods. They bound the father and son of the household and forced them to reveal where the silver was hidden. Because the fields had not yet been harvested, there was no extra money. The bandits believed that they were being cunning and beat Qiushan severely, causing internal injuries, and his son suffered severe external injuries. As a result, they were robbed of the money for selling rice and left. They then went to the home of Zhang Quanjing in the same village to search and rob, but Zhang's situation was not as good as before, so the losses were minor. They also went to the home of Zhang Yongjin. When the homeowner heard the alarm, he planned to escape from the back door, but he was shot in the arm by a bandit on the lookout, causing him extreme pain and falling to the ground, allowing the bandits to plunder at will. After being reported, the Public Security Sub-Station dispatched four police officers led by Inspector Fu to pursue the bandits, but they were not caught. Zhang Yongjin, who was shot, went to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. The bullet was removed yesterday, and his life is not in danger. According to the fishermen guarding the crab weirs that night, the bandits were seen going south along the Panlong Pond.</p>
<p>Provincial Middle School Training Soldiers. According to the regulations for middle schools, military exercises must be taught to train the physique, but firearms must be provided for practical exercises. Previously, Principal Chen submitted a request to the Department of Education, which was forwarded to the Provincial Government, to order the Songjiang County Government to allocate firearms for borrowing. After receiving the order, the County Government sent a letter to the school asking them to send personnel to the County Government to inquire about the type of firearms to be borrowed so that they could be distributed. The school sent personnel to the County Government to select fourteen discarded firearms from storage for training.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Abundant Harvest, Appropriate Reduction of Prisoner Rations. Because the county magistrates of various counties reported that this year's autumn harvest was abundant and rice prices had fallen, Judge Lin of the Higher Court specially issued an order to the county magistrates and prison guards of various counties to appropriately reduce the prisoner rations from November 1st, setting the amount at 11 cents per person per day. For the counties formerly under the Hai-Dao Circuit, the amount was set at 10 cents per person per day, and the weight was set at a minimum of 20 taels of dry rice per person per meal. No further shortages were allowed.</p>
<p>Clansmen Collude with Bandits to Kidnap. It has been many days since the kidnapping of Cha Gaoshi and his son Aisheng, villagers of Chajiang Shouting, Beigang Village, Shidu Si-tu, Hengbang Township, in the county. According to Cha Shoutian, the case was colluded with by his sister-in-law Cha Xiangshi, who colluded with the worker Jin Aduo and bandits. He reported to the Third Zhongdui Police Station stationed in Fan. The two men, Cha Xiangshi and Jin Aduo, were arrested and brought to the team for interrogation for many days. Cha Shoutian submitted a report to the county government after learning that Cha Xiangshi and others had been arrested. Yesterday (23rd) afternoon, the Third Zhongdui transferred the arrested Cha Xiangshi and Jin Aduo to Suzhou and searched Cha Xiangshi's body, finding a threatening letter demanding 30,000 yuan from Cha Shoutian, which was submitted to the county for review.</p>
<p>Dung Sections Must Be Priced to Be Taken Over by the Public. The Yongye Public Office and others petitioned to abolish the dung sections, and Hua Xinqing submitted a memorial to the province, following Shanghai's example of setting up a cleaning bureau to manage urine and feces, and using the income to allocate education funds. Now, the province has approved that the dung sections are private property and must be priced before they can be taken over by the public. After Hua received the approval, he had already prepared the money to take over all the dung sections.</p>
<p>Shipping Boats Robbed at Laoshu Mountain. A shipping boat traveling from Dongting Xishan Donghoushi Bridge to Suzhou City was suddenly encountered by a small steamship behind Laoshu Mountain in Taihu a few days ago.

They immediately robbed the ship, taking away more than 700 yuan in banknotes and more than 200 yuan in cash for handling goods. None of the passengers were spared, and the total loss was more than 1,000 yuan. The boat owner Xu Fosheng reported the incident to the 14th Sub-Bureau, which sent a team to pursue and suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Father-in-law Attempts to Rape Daughter-in-law Late at Night. Yue Genhu, a villager in Dujia Village near the main street of the Twelfth District (Taibo City) in this county, is nearly forty years old and likes fishing for colors. His daughter-in-law, Ji Xiaomei, is beautiful and Yue Genhu often thinks of taking advantage of her. A few days ago, Genhu took advantage of his son's absence and sneaked into his daughter-in-law's room and hid under the bed. When Xiaomei fell asleep, he took off his clothes and got into bed, intending to commit indecent acts. Xiaomei woke up in shock and swore to die rather than submit, shouting for help. When Genhu saw this, he was extremely angry and grabbed his daughter-in-law, beat her with a door bolt, causing her to be covered in bruises, and locked her with iron chains, preventing her from moving. Xiaomei's mother, Ji, found out and was furious, and immediately reported to the 11th Public Security Sub-Bureau, which sent police to arrest Genhu and took Xiaomei to the bureau for questioning. Xiaomei was then allowed to go home with her mother to treat her injuries. Yue Genhu was temporarily detained and will be sent to the main bureau and then to the county for legal action.</p>
<p>Liang Takes Office as Assessor and Inspects Matters.

He also met with Assessor Yu and exchanged pleasantries. In the afternoon at 2:00 PM, he formally took office and opened court to hear cases.</p>
<p>Large Number of Suspected Thieves Arrested and Sent to the County. Xue Furi, the leader of the detective team of the County Public Security Bureau, received a secret report a few days ago that several thieves were drinking tea at the Xixinlou Tea House outside the West Gate. After receiving the report, Leader Xue immediately led the detectives to investigate and arrested three suspected thieves, Gu Yanjiang, Zhao Rongxi, and Da , at the tea house. At night, they also captured five thieves, Gao Da Yangzi, Wang Da Sizi, Zhao Gongzeng, Gao Xibao, and Gao Sanbao, near Shitang in Taihu Lake. They were immediately sent to the bureau together. Yesterday, Wang Zhonghu of the Third Section opened court to interrogate Gu and the other eight criminals. None of the criminals admitted to the robbery with firearms. After the interrogation, they were sent to the county government for questioning together with the informant, Zhao Xingpei. Also, a team leader of the Second Zhongdui of the County Police Team arrested a suspected Communist Party member, Sun Jinbao, in a certain place yesterday and immediately sent him to the team for interrogation and detention.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The Chief of the Anti-Smuggling Team Was Robbed. Wang Baoyuan, the chief of the general team of the First Anti-Smuggling Brigade stationed in Liuhe, Taicang, is now under orders to be transferred to the post of team leader of the Fifth Team of the Tenth Brigade in Jiangyin. After receiving the order, Wang packed his bags and went to take office on the 19th. Because the team was quite far from the city, he could not make it there that night and stayed at the Jiangnan Grand Hotel. The next day (20th), he planned to go to take over the office. At about 9:00 AM, when he passed Xiagang, about five or six miles from Shenggang, he suddenly encountered five or six robbers who used two box cannons to stop Team Leader Wang's progress. Because the place was deserted and there were many robbers with firearms, he knew that resistance was not an option, so he listened to their command. The bandits then took him to the seaside and boarded a boat that they had prepared, prohibiting him from making any noise. They then dropped anchor in the river and began to search Wang Baoyuan's body and take off his clothes. He was robbed of 380 silver dollars, his commission letter, and luggage. He was released on the 21st. Because he had nowhere to stay, he took a ship to Changshu the next day and arrived at the Anti-Smuggling Camp Team Department outside the Xiaodong Gate. Team Leader Jiang Fuwu of the Tenth Brigade stationed in Changshu received him. He has now telegraphed the Jiangyin Salt Public Office to publish the revocation of the commission letter in the newspaper and notified the Third, Fourth, and Fifth Sub-Teams stationed in Cheng to assist in capturing the bandits. On the 23rd, he personally took a ship to Shanghai to report to the Anti-Smuggling General Team for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Minutes of the County Government Meeting. The County Government Meeting was held on the 21st for the eighty-fifth meeting, resolving: (1) To send letters to Wu Tinglu, Wu Dachen, Zhu Danqing, Cao Yuanmo, Cao Jiada, Xia Juemou, Guo Songgang, Sun Jinzhi, and Jin Zhaozhi to inquire about the annals. (2) Recently, the Finance Bureau raised 4,500 yuan to be paid to the Provincial Security Office to purchase firearms. The cost will be repaid from the additional police squad fees collected from the 19th-year Caomi rent. In addition, the surplus from the 18th-year police mu tax will be used by the Finance Bureau to borrow from the county for adding mechanical ammunition. (3) The Construction Bureau was ordered to demolish Huoxiang and open Zhongshan Public Park. (4) It is imperative to install long-distance telephones in Xixiang. The county magistrate and the Xixiang Township Office will find ways to raise funds.</p>
<p>The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs Ordered the County to Investigate the Xixiang Township Office. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs received a telegram from Chen Jingchen, a standing committee member of the Xixiang Township Office, stating that bandits and communists were rampant in Jiangyin, and the local security was lost. Please immediately remove and punish the responsible personnel. The county has repeatedly experienced bandit disasters, and the officials have led teams to search and suppress them, which is commendable. The Xixiang Township Office has exaggerated and attacked them by way of excuse, which is not appropriate. Moreover, the Xixiang Township Office has no such provisions in the autonomy law. The telegram was sent from Shanghai, which is even more strange. Special instructions are given to County Magistrate Li to investigate and verify the matter.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs Assigned Officials to Reinvestigate the Case of Forced Labor. The case of forced labor in Jiaxing has not yet been resolved. Although County Magistrate Jiang Zhicheng and Public Security Bureau Chief Mo Runxun have been transferred to other posts, local people are hoping that the provincial authorities will handle this case as soon as possible to avoid delays. Recently, the members of the Commercial and Trade Association have again requested the County Party Department to forward a letter to the Provincial Party Department, requesting the Provincial Government to send officials to reinvestigate the matter to clarify it fairly. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs has received an order from the government to assign Inspector Wu Qi of the department to conduct a confidential investigation in He. It is reported that after Wu arrived in He, he went to the County Party Department to review the relevant documents and telegrams related to the case. At the same time, he also went to Dayingqian and the local shops to investigate the truth about the forced labor at that time. He also copied the list of laborers that day, and has completed the investigation and returned to the province to report. It is also reported that Xu Ajin, who was forced to labor, filed a lawsuit with the court against Public Security Bureau Chief Mo for using violence and coercion to force him to do things that he was not obligated to do. The Hangzhou County District Court had summoned a group of witnesses for questioning many times. It is now learned that the Hangzhou Court has scheduled a hearing on October 30 to summon the original parties and witnesses for questioning. It is necessary to handle the case together in order to conclude it.</p>
<p>Petition to Prohibit Grain Dealers from Exploiting. Grain dealers in Jiaxing sell inferior rice to farmers who borrow rice at top prices and charge a monthly interest of 2%. Therefore, if you borrow one stone of winter rice at the end of spring this year, you will have to return two and a half stones. The rice is borrowed year after year, and farmers have no savings. Most grain merchants get rich because of this. Now, the Yuxi District Farmers' Association has submitted a request to the County Agricultural Consolidation Association, which has forwarded it to the County Party Department to prohibit the exploitative practices of grain dealers and relieve the suffering of the farmers in Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Attempt to Rob Qingdong Village. At 9:30 PM last night, several bandit boats suddenly came to a place two li away from Qingdongmen in this city. More than twenty bandits, speaking Hakka dialect, each carried wooden-cased guns and flashlights. After landing, they searched around the village. The villagers found out about this and reported it to the city police. The city police transferred the telegram to the Public Security Bureau, which immediately sent forty regular police officers and the Second Regiment of the Security Team, with a machine gun platoon, to the city to suppress the bandits. However, the bandits also learned that the troops in the city had been dispatched, so they did not dare to break into doors and rob people. They only kidnapped two daughters of a certain family and fled in a northwesterly direction.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>All Wounded Soldiers Go to Beijing. The Nantong No. 31 Rear Hospital was ordered to be closed.

<h3>Strike at Various Schools in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Due to Students' Left-Leaning Ideologies and the Commercialization of Schools</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch. Students of various universities, in response to the notification made to the school authorities, resolved to take measures in the near future, and have officially commenced a strike starting today. In addition, female students of the Women's University and the Tokyo Women's Medical School, amidst the ongoing dispute, have also initiated a strike. In the past year, a total of thirty schools have been involved in disputes, with more than six hundred students receiving reprimands or more severe punishments. This appears to be a period of school disturbances, largely influenced by society, especially by leftist ideologies and the commercialization of schools. Furthermore, the difficulty in finding employment and the anxiety about the future have stimulated students' nerves, increasing their inclination to agree. The Vice-Minister of Education, Nan, vaguely stated that the urgent task today is to fully understand the trends of the times and provide students with comprehensible education. Unjustified and excessive suppression of their research in social sciences will lead to adverse consequences.</p>
<h3>The Turmoil at National Central University Continues</h3>
<p>Zhang Naiyan Resigns to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The Commercial Hospital Alumni Association Issues Opinion</p>
<p>President Zhang Resigns: Zhang Naiyan, President of National Central University, submits a report to Chairman Chiang, stating: "Chairman Chiang, since I was honored to receive your favor in Guangdong, I have been cautious and diligent, fearing to harm your recognition of my abilities. In recent years, due to my inclination towards research, I have dared to lead National Central University, though my abilities are limited. I have worked tirelessly day and night, hoping to avoid major errors. However, today, opinions are diverse, and differences in wisdom and benevolence are inevitable. I, Naiyan, believe that my efforts may inadvertently lead to mistakes. Furthermore, for a cause to achieve daily renewal, facilities should frequently be improved. Three years in office is a common period in the past, and alternating trials are good rules to follow. Based on this idea, I humbly request that you, Chairman, allow me to temporarily leave the position of President of National Central University and appoint another capable person to take my place. This will provide the university with an opportunity for continuous renewal, and I can devote my efforts to other appropriate tasks. This would achieve two benefits in one stroke. I am trembling and awaiting your approval, as it is truly in the public interest." Zhang Naiyan, October 21, 1920.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Commercial and Medical Schools: The spread of the current reform of school affairs at National Central University has attracted great attention from all sectors of society. The university currently has eight colleges, and the Commercial and Medical Schools, due to their remote location in Shanghai, have not been personally involved in the content of this conflict. It is now known that the deans and all faculty and staff of the two colleges, fearing that the turmoil will escalate, have specially sent a letter to the President to contribute. The letter is recorded below for the reference of President Jun Mou and all faculty and staff in Beijing: "Recently, we read in newspapers and the university's daily publications that some students in Beijing have declared their desire to improve school affairs, and their intention to protect the university is commendable. However, we believe that the procedures are inappropriate. All the proposed improvements can be directly presented to the President or the school affairs meeting for easy selection and implementation. Now, disregarding the reputation of the university and publicizing it externally will cause misunderstandings and provide opportunities for others to take advantage. If unfortunately, unexpected complications arise and create disturbances, it will violate the initial purpose of improving school affairs. We sincerely hope that the President and all teachers will carefully examine all the students' demands and implement them in accordance with the predetermined plan to satisfy the expectations of all parties. We should always maintain the spirit of education as a profession, so that the future of National Central University will be bright. We offer our humble advice and hope for your clear instruction. Sincerely, Dean of the Commercial School, Dean of the Medical School, Yan, and all faculty and staff."</p>
<p>Letter from the Alumni Association to Zhang Naiyan: The Alumni Association of Graduates from Nango, Todai, and National Central University held a full meeting of its executive and supervisory committees the other day to support the students' proposal to improve school affairs and decided to send a letter to the President of the alma mater, Zhang Naiyan, offering four suggestions for improving school affairs. Yesterday (22nd), the letter was delivered to Zhang Naiyan. The original letter is recorded below: "President Jun Mou, We, the alumni association of graduates from Nango, Todai, and National Central University, pay our respects. National Central University, located in the capital, inherited the traditions of Nango and Todai and became the cultural center of the country. Recently, accidents have occurred repeatedly within the university, and the situation is precarious. The entire university is on the verge of instability. Thinking of your recent situation, sir, we are deeply concerned. The alumni believe that whenever the university is in trouble, improper evil forces from outside the university easily take advantage of the situation. We earnestly hope that you and all the teachers and students of the university will quickly find a way to improve school affairs to avoid shaking the foundation of the university. Based on our past experience, we respectfully offer you a brief overview. Those who hold a conquering attitude and partisan colors often pick up one or two fragmented histories of the alma mater and fear being attacked. The achievements and sins of a few people in the era of Nango and Todai are for society to judge. However, whether it is merit or sin, it should never involve all the teachers and students of the past or present. Even their commendable advantages should not be completely erased. In the future, if anyone recklessly slanders, attacks arbitrarily, or harbors ambitions and desires, all the members of the association will uphold the spirit of protecting the alma mater and swear to fight to the end. Only by strengthening the internal affairs of the school can we avoid giving others an excuse. Our association learns from past mistakes and cannot remain silent. We hope that the school will make a decisive decision and quickly seek stability within the school to prevent outsiders from coveting it. Therefore, our association held a full meeting of its executive and supervisory committees yesterday and decided to offer the following four suggestions to the alma mater: (1) Vigorously implement party ideology education and eliminate corrupt elements. The alma mater is located in the capital and should not only earnestly implement party ideology education but also have the responsibility to lead all schools in the country. In the future, special attention should be paid to party ideology courses, library facilities, lectures, and research societies to ensure that the spirit of party ideology permeates the entire school. The school has a wide scope and a large number of people, and it is inevitable that there will be a mix of people. All faculty and staff who have erroneous thoughts, are ignorant and incompetent, or whose behavior is base and close to reactionaries should be investigated and thoroughly eliminated at any time to strengthen the foundation of the school. (2) Implement professor-led school governance. The alma mater is the highest institution of learning, and the eyes of the country are upon it. It is appropriate to be open and honest, gather ideas, and jointly plan ways to improve. Therefore, the number of people in the school affairs meeting must be expanded, and the economic and personnel matters must be made public to avoid being controlled and monopolized by a few people. (3) Reduce administrative expenses, cut redundant personnel, and increase equipment expenses. The alma mater has an annual budget of more than 2 million yuan, which is not a small amount. However, due to uneven distribution, there have been abuses. Outside rumors say that administrative expenses account for more than 300,000 yuan a year, which is shocking. Therefore, efforts should be made to verify and cut down on waste. (4) Please approve the resignation of Zhang Heng, secretary and secretary-general, from all his positions. Zhang Heng has been in the school for several years and has ignored public opinion. He is one of the main reasons for the current school affairs conflict. Please approve his resignation from all his positions as soon as possible. The association believes that the above four points can resolve the current conflict and increase educational efficiency. We hope that you will adopt them as much as possible and implement them immediately to comfort the eager anticipation of all the students in the school. This is our earnest prayer. With best wishes."</p>
<h3>This Year's Education Expenses in Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>Increased by 160,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Panyang Correspondence: The expenses for the provincial middle and primary schools and libraries in Liaoning, as well as the subsidies for studying abroad, have been separately increased and included in the new budget by the Department of Education. The provincial government and the Department of Finance have approved the establishment, which is more than 160,000 yuan higher than in 1918. The expenses for the provincial schools and libraries have increased to more than 1.2 million yuan, and the subsidies for studying abroad have increased to 348,824 yuan. The subsidies have increased by 48,000 yuan compared to last year, probably because the fixed subsidies for studying abroad are not enough due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver.</p>

<h3>Li Da</h3>
<h3>Consumer Cooperative Propaganda Movement</h3>
<p>The Li Da Consumer Cooperative on Li Da Road in Jiangwan is organized by teachers, students, workers, and nearby residents of the Li Da School. It was registered with the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau in mid-December of last year and began operations. It was originally planned to raise 500 shares at two yuan per share, but due to the newness of the business, investors were not very enthusiastic, and only over 300 shares were raised. However, after starting operations, it was found to be very convenient and the business was very developed. At the end of March this year, after calculating the expenses such as staff salaries and rent, which amounted to more than 60 yuan per month, there was still a net profit of 300 yuan. In the most recent six months, the monthly necessary expenses have increased to more than 80 yuan, but the profit ratio is still the same as before. In recent years, the country has vigorously promoted the cooperative movement, and consumer cooperatives have emerged in response to the trend. However, most of them have failed. The society is fortunate to have achieved past successes and plans to launch a major propaganda movement on the afternoon of October 25, when the Third Congress is held. On that day, a movie will be shown in the auditorium of the Li Da School, and there will be celebrity speeches and various entertainments. Nearby residents will be sent door-to-door tickets, and those with tickets will be allowed to watch. It is also heard that the society plans to use the accumulated educational propaganda funds to conduct literacy campaigns in nearby villages.</p>

<h3>The End of the Northeast Four Provinces Joint Games</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication: The first Northeast Joint Games, sponsored by the Liaoning Provincial Education Association, closed on the 14th of this month. Before the athletes from various places left Shenyang, Wang Huayi, the president of the Provincial Education Association, gathered people to discuss the establishment of the Northeast Sports Promotion Association. After most of the athletes had left, a ceremony was initiated to thank the hard-working staff of the various departments during the Games. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Preparation for the Establishment of the Sports Promotion Association: Wang Huayi, the president of the Provincial Education Association, in order to study and develop the fundamental plan for sports in various parts of the Northeast, specifically requested that each group attending the Joint Games send a sports expert to a meeting to discuss the establishment of the Northeast Sports Promotion Association. Dongte, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Andong, Kaiyuan, Tieling, Gaiping, Liaoyang, and other places specially recommended one representative each to attend the meeting.

<h3>Chinese Women's Sports</h3>
<p>Director of the Physical Education Department of Jinan University (3)</p>
<p>Chen Zhang'e</p>
<p>First, for the health and happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>Second, to preserve the original physique and instincts of mankind.</p>
<p>Third, to advance all human abilities.</p>
<p>To sum up the above three points, it means that physical education, hygiene, and education are combined to protect health and cultivate morality as the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Below, I will briefly mention one or two results of physical education and life, and then add some explanations.</p>
<p>(1) Sensory Sensitivity: As the saying goes, "Three years old is the root, a hundred years old is hard to adjust." Simply put, any training of any kind of learning must start when children are young, as it is easier. In the gymnasium, two twelve-year-old children joined basketball at the same time, and a forty-year-old middle-aged man also joined. The child in his youth and the middle-aged man were both practicing basketball for the first time. At the beginning, neither of them understood how to catch, pass, or shoot the ball. When the ball came, not only could they not catch it, but they were also very afraid and overwhelmed, and their movements were abnormal. After continuing to practice for two months, after detailed observation, the result of the two was that the child made very fast progress in catching, passing, and shooting the ball, which was really astonishing. At the same time, the middle-aged man made no progress at all. Whenever the ball came, his hands and feet were in a mess because his nerves and muscles would not cooperate and were not sensitive. From this, we can understand the effect of physical education on sensory sensitivity.</p>
<p>(2) Posture and Health: Posture and health are quite interesting. Please allow me to explain a few honest words. Now, our Chinese schools have calisthenics, German-style or Swedish-style gymnastics, and various sports. The purpose of these exercises is to correct bad physiques and improve health. Physical education and health: Dr. Maran of Harvard University in the United States is a famous figure in physical education. He has a lot of experience in studying whether physical education can improve health and longevity. In 1902, Dr. Maran studied 123 rowers at the school. Two of them suffered from heart disease and died, eight sacrificed themselves for the country, twenty-eight were world-renowned figures, and eight were figures of great prestige in the United States. The remaining seventy-odd were successful businessmen. According to such a survey, it is not only related to longevity, but also closely related to personal career and personal happiness.</p>
<p>(3) Cultivating Habits: The morning exercises, evening exercises, calisthenics, and extracurricular sports, annual and seasonal sports meets that are currently scheduled in our school curriculum are all for cultivating various work habits. In the past, the British general Wellington liked to play football when he was a student. Every year, schools held football competitions, and Wellington was a powerful player in the school. However, he repeatedly failed in the water competitions. Although Wellington suffered many painful failures, he still did not lose heart and continued to work hard. When it came time to graduate, it was his last football season, so he vowed that if he did not defeat the enemy this year, he would not take his diploma. When the football competition began, Wellington still worked hard. At the end of the competition, the referee announced Wellington's victory. Wellington's final victory was really cultivated from habits. Later, Wellington became a British general and often led millions of troops to fight against Napoleon. He was defeated repeatedly, but in the final Battle of Waterloo, Napoleon, whose fame overshadowed the world, was imprisoned, and Wellington sang the song of triumph. His perseverance was really learned from school practice. Physical education is enough to cultivate habits and be the mother of success in future struggles. This sentence is really correct.</p>

<p>Reporting on the Situation in the North</p>
<p>Since taking office as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Zhang Xueliang has been wholeheartedly supporting the Central Government. Yesterday, he sent two telegrams, Jia Yi and Jia Er, to Mayor Zhang Yuejun, reporting on the situation in the North. Here are excerpts from the original telegrams:</p>
<p>Telegram Jia Yi: To Mayor Zhang Yuejun of Shanghai, with respect. According to a secret report, a cavalry train from the Fourth Route Army is heading from Xinxiang to Zhangde.

<h3>Jiangxi Natives in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Request the Dispatch of Troops to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>A Fellow-Provincials Meeting Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>It Was Resolved to Telegraph Various Parties</p>
<p>To Effectively Promote Suppression</p>
<p>Jiangxi natives in Shanghai held a fellow-provincials meeting at the Jiangxi Guild Hall in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, yesterday afternoon. It was resolved to request the government to dispatch troops to suppress Jiangxi bandits, and to organize a bandit-suppression promotion committee to elect responsible committee members. Telegrams were sent to the National Government, Chairman Chiang, He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, Xiong Shihui, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Liu Zhi, the chairman of Henan Province. Attendees included Li Liejun's representative, Xu Yuanhao, the Municipal Party Department representative, Zhang Yaoming, and more than a hundred Jiangxi natives in Shanghai. At 3:00 in the afternoon, Huang Baoxiang, Liu Zhigang, Chen Baixu, Zeng Shimei, Huang Guowen, and other five people served as the chairman's team for the meeting. First, Huang Baoxiang reported on the purpose of the meeting, saying that the reason for holding this meeting today is that more than 60 of our Jiangxi's 81 counties have been ravaged by bandits, and places such as Ji'an, Linjiang, and Raozhou have recently continued to fall. Previously, this association sent Wu Nanpu and Zeng Yuchen to Nanjing to petition the government to send troops to suppress the bandits as soon as possible. Now, there are many troops going to Jiangxi, but it is heard that they are stationed in the capital and nearby provinces where there are no bandits, and have not yet actually advanced to suppress them. However, the people in the counties occupied by the bandits are in dire straits and urgently need rescue, so we have called this meeting to discuss and intend to make three more requests to the government: (1) The current troops in Jiangxi should be under the command of one person; (2) The bandits should be suppressed within three months, and the commander will be held accountable if the deadline is exceeded; (3) Military pay should be fully funded by the government, and the people of Jiangxi cannot afford to bear any more burdens. In addition, publications will be issued, etc. Then, Liu Zhigang reported on the situation of being attacked by bandits. The Municipal Party Department representative attended and provided guidance. Then, Zeng Shimei proposed three items: (1) Please send a special commissioner to suppress the bandits as soon as possible to thoroughly suppress the bandits; (2) Please provide sufficient supplies to the bandit-suppression troops and strictly prohibit raising funds on the spot, and do not create new names to force the people to bear the burden; (3) Organize a bandit-suppression promotion committee to be responsible for promoting bandit-suppression work. They were unanimously adopted, and Ye Zilue, Liu Zixia, Liu Zizhen, Dai Yuheng, Liu Zhigang, Qian Pinsong, Shen Jiayu, He Rulong, Huang Baoxiang, Chen Baixu, Lu Haiquan, Ouyang Hancun, Liu Qianchuang, Zeng Shiying, Yang Lisan, Rao Junqi, Li Shucheng, Huang Guowen, Wang Zhulin, Zeng Yuchen, Li Langqu, and other twenty-one people were elected as members of the promotion committee, and Huang Danchu, Huang Jiemin, Zhong Fuhou, Wu Nanpu, Wang Lansheng, Xu Yuanhao, Luo Jiaheng, and other seven people were elected as alternate members. It was also decided to send telegrams to various parties, and the original texts are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government, Chairman Chiang: To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, with respect. The bandit disaster in Jiangxi is more severe than in Hunan and Hubei. Now, Hunan Province has announced that it has been suppressed, and Hubei Province has also set a deadline for suppression. However, in Jiangxi, we only hear of the panic of the six divisions, and the lost land has not been recovered. We dare not speculate on what other situation there is, but we are worried that it is not a decision to join forces to suppress the bandits, fearing that it will be like Hunan using its neighbors as a drainage ditch, causing Ji'an, the central hub of the province, to fall. If we transfer troops from three sides, only taking care of the Nanchang route, we will inevitably cause Ganzhou to fall into the hands of bandits again, which is enough to create a large base camp for the communist bandits in the more than a thousand miles of border mountainous areas of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. It will be even more difficult to suppress them in the future. Even if they can be suppressed in the future, the country will sacrifice more, and the people will become withered wax. This is inevitable in reason and is not a dangerous word to scare people. The members of this association, in the body of orphans, sincerely hope for recovery. They held the Jiangxi Fellow-Provincials Conference at the Jiangxi Guild Hall in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, on October 23, and unanimously decided to request that a special commissioner be sent to unify the power to suppress the bandits and strictly hold the Jiangxi authorities responsible. A special commissioner was sent to raise sufficient military pay and exempt the local burden. They specially expressed their sorrow and expressed their foolish concerns to you. I hope you will benefit Jiangxi. Sincerely, the Jiangxi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Telegram to Commander Xiong and Chairman Liu: To Commander Xiong Tianyi of Shanghai and Chairman Liu Jingfu of Kaifeng, with respect. The bandit disaster in our province has long been known. Now, although troops have been increased and a commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces has been established to unify authority, it has been a long time, and we only hear of strictly guarding the lonely city of Nanchang and have not recovered an inch of land upstream. The people who have been left behind are not guaranteed to survive the night. The meaning of saving the province is the same for everyone. This association held a fellow-provincials conference at the Jiangxi Guild Hall on the 23rd of the month and decided to request your help. The overall situation has been set, and the military strength can be divided. There are differences in love and affection. It is human nature. Recently, Commander He Gong Xuezhuan of the three provinces has gathered a large army to suppress the bandits in Hubei first, which can be used as evidence. Your duty is to have authority and to unify. It is difficult to cross the line when you hold the ambition of wearing a crown. Looking up to the clouds, it is better to be depressed. The home has been turned into overgrown grass. The land has been lost, but honor has not been lost. Speaking out righteously is enough to rectify discipline. The ancients were in the rivers and lakes, but their hearts were in the court, let alone those who have special powers? Words are heavier than nine tripods, and ambition is more difficult to be humiliated than a common man. This is what this association hopes. When people are in trouble, they cry to the sky, and how can they choose? We only hope that you will understand and save us. Sincerely, the Jiangxi Fellow-Provincials Association.</p>
<p>Telegram to Commander He: To Commander He Xuezhuan of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces in Hankou, with respect. The bandit disaster in the three provinces is too numerous to record. Fortunately, Hunan Province has announced that it has been suppressed, and Hubei Province has also set a deadline for suppression. A large army has gathered and will realize your hope of suppressing the bandits in three months. However, in Jiangxi, we only hear of the panic of the six divisions, and not an inch of land has been recovered. We dare not speculate on what other situation there is, but we are worried that it is not a decision to join forces to suppress the bandits, fearing that it will be like Hunan using its neighbors as a drainage ditch, causing Ji'an, the central hub of the province, to fall. If we transfer troops from three sides, only taking care of the Nanchang route, we will inevitably cause Ganzhou, an important town, to fall into the hands of bandits, which is enough to create a large base camp for the communist bandits in the more than a thousand miles of border mountainous areas of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. It will be even more difficult to suppress them in the future. Even if they can be suppressed in the future, the country will sacrifice more, and the people will become withered wax. This is inevitable in reason and is not a dangerous word to scare people. Your duty combines the three provinces, and the friendship is the same as a family. Cutting off this little devil is even more divine. The members of this association, in the body of orphans, sincerely hope for recovery. They held the Jiangxi Fellow-Provincials Conference at the Jiangxi Guild Hall in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, on October 23 to seek a way to save their lives and make a dying cry. They specially expressed their sorrow and expressed their foolish concerns to you. We hope that you will truly benefit Jiangxi. Sincerely, the Jiangxi Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Silk Industry Is in Great Decline</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Six Factories Will Suspend Work Next Month</p>
<p>All one hundred and six silk factories in Shanghai have announced that they will suspend operations due to the slump in sales of foreign silk this year, the low price of local silk, the loss of funds, and the inability to support themselves. They have filed a request with the government for funds to provide relief. It is reported that 80-90% of the silk factories in Shanghai have stopped their machines. A small number of silk factories are still working as usual because they are fulfilling term silk relations with foreign firms and have not yet reeled off the remaining cocoons. Because of the heavy snow in New York, the sluggish business in Lyon and Paris, France due to the Italian-French problem, the delay in the silk weaving factory's term silk shipments, and the sharp drop in silk prices, the Yokohama silk price has fallen to 600 yen, and the silk market is lifeless. The cost of factory silk is relatively high, and it is even more difficult to sell because of huge losses. The silk factories in Shanghai that have not stopped working will continue to suspend operations at the end of this month. From the first day of next month, all one hundred and six silk factories in Shanghai will stop working. The situation is becoming more and more serious.</p>

<h3>A Precursor to the Banning of Gambling in the Concession</h3>
<p>Superintendent E.I.M. Barrett Discusses the Evils of Gambling</p>
<p>Will Do His Utmost to Prohibit It</p>
<p>Public Concession's Director-General, Mr. Fessenden, had written to Superintendent E.I.M. Barrett regarding the matter of public gambling dens in the concession and received a reply from Mr. Barrett. The original letter appears in today's Public Concession Gazette, which is translated below:</p>
<p>September 8, Mr. Fessenden wrote to Mr. Barrett: I recently read a declaration by a former New York City Police Commissioner, who has a distinguished reputation in the police force. His words are particularly relevant to certain situations in Shanghai and are worth considering. He said, "I am in the position of eliminating violence and protecting the good, and I feel that the key to fulfilling my duty is to prohibit gambling. Commercial gambling cannot exist with legitimate money. There must be an easily accessible source of money. No legitimately employed person can support a specialized gambling operation for long. Gambling cannot thrive for long with the support of a few club members. There must be outside money to support it. Large gambling dens cannot last without protection. The police department is responsible for knowing their location. If there is no protection from the police, then there must be other forms of protection. Once the news that gambling is protected spreads, criminals flock to it like men and women seeking wealth flock to new mining areas. Those who run gambling dens must have easily accessible money. If they cannot get it, they will find other ways to get it quickly. Thus, robbery, kidnapping, and murder occur repeatedly. This is a deterioration of society. Scoundrels soon realize that if gambling is protected, they can also get protection if they commit other crimes. Thus, they become unscrupulous. Ask me where the protected places are, and I will show you. Now, there is a city where various crimes are rampant." I feel something after reading this. Commercial gambling in Shanghai is more widespread than in most cities of the same size. Dog racing, horse racing, and jai alai, although not strictly protected, are allowed to be established, and the bets are very large. Chinese people say that these types of gambling are directly related to armed robbery, kidnapping, and theft. Is there any real basis for this statement? Is there any real reason to believe that these types of gambling do have an impact on crime in Shanghai? I would be grateful for your opinion.</p>
<p>September 22, Mr. Barrett replied to Mr. Fessenden: I read your letter of September 8, quoting the declaration of a former New York Police Commissioner. I do not want to comment on it other than to say that his words completely refer to Shanghai. Based on my experience in the Near East and India, there is a direct relationship between gambling and crime. Wherever there is large-scale gambling, there must be a lot of crime. This is an indisputable fact. Now, let me tell you about a personal experience to show how particularly concerned I have been about this. Near the end of the European War, I served in the Transportation Inspectorate of Mesopotamia, a special secret investigation department. There was a town called Amara on the banks of the Tigris River, which was densely populated and had many military camps. It was an important base for the vanguard. Major cases occurred frequently, especially theft. Residents, hospitals, and military camps were unable to sleep peacefully. There were major thefts every night. I was specially ordered to go to the area to assist local officials in investigating the thefts. On the day I arrived, I met an Indian recidivist and begged for his help, as I had been kind to him in the past. The next morning, he came to tell me that if I could search a place where many Indians were gambling, I could get the necessary clues. So, I captured a large number of gamblers and found countless stolen goods within a week. Then, a military court was opened and the criminals were brought to justice. After that, major cases in the area disappeared. The reason for this was that several Indian supervisors had set up a very large gambling den and recruited many evildoers, who specialized in stealing to get money for gambling. Gambling is the greatest temptation for crime in the East. It is enough to entice recidivists and create new criminals. It has a particularly serious and adverse impact on the police force. India relies entirely on strictly prohibiting gambling, and the police department can stop the growth of crime. Commercial gambling is horse racing, but the organizers of the horse racing club try to maintain this as a real sport and recreation. Races are held regularly, and tickets are priced high to avoid the spread of gambling and prevent those who cannot afford to gamble from entering the arena. On race days, the police patrol outside the arena to prevent the crowd from colluding with people inside the arena to gamble outside the arena. Special methods are used to stop shops in the town from gambling on horse numbers. Commercial gambling in Shanghai is more harmful than ordinary gambling dens, because the police department can close gambling dens, but the police department has no right to interfere with commercial gambling, so it is becoming more and more prosperous. Many of the proceeds of thieves are spent on gambling, as evidenced by the fact that one of the criminals who murdered Mr. Hart spent all the stolen goods he received in gambling dens within a week. Anyone who comes to this type of gambling den can see gamblers flocking to it night after night as if they were drunk and infatuated, and the horse ticket is especially tempting to the public. Door attendants often ignore the rules of collecting tickets. Last autumn, before the race season, armed robbery cases in the concession suddenly increased. I thought it was strange, but I checked the reports of the Criminal Division and found that the same situation occurred before the spring race season in the past. The only difference this year during the spring races was that the increase in previous years may not have been caused by horse racing. However, I think it was a coincidence. The evil of gambling is not only in the desire to get gambling money, but also deeper than that. Criminals are naturally devoid of morality. Their temptation to places where they have the opportunity to commit violence is far less than the place where they can satisfy their evil thoughts. Women, gambling, and other lowly pleasures are gathered in one place, so they will naturally linger and be reluctant to leave. The scope of places in Shanghai that provide pleasure for these people is far greater than in other places. Therefore, unless this most inferior harm is eliminated, such as (1) illegal opium trade, (2) gambling, (3) general licentious places, the collection of crimes in Shanghai will continue to increase. The three types mentioned above are not only enough to attract criminals to occupy, but also enough to make the operators have a rich income to support ordinary thugs. When an accomplice violates the law and is detained by the police department, they can rely on their financial strength to defeat justice. For this reason, I advocate doing my utmost to prohibit all kinds of commercial or other gambling.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Triply Requests</h3>
<h3>Negotiation Regarding the Dutch Colonies' Increased Entry Tax</h3>
<p>Advocates for Joint Protest with Other Countries' Ambassadors and Consuls</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday submitted a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating, "Regarding the Dutch colonies' repeated increases in harsh entry taxes, causing great harm to overseas Chinese, we urge you to instruct the relevant ambassadors and consuls to jointly protest with the ambassadors and consuls of Japan and other friendly nations with deeper ties to the Dutch colonies, in order to protect overseas Chinese and maintain their businesses." Previously, Standing Committee member Lin Youren proposed that the Dutch Colonial Council, in June of this year, re-submitted the previously discussed but not implemented proposal from last year to increase the entry tax for foreigners, deciding to re-deliberate it. Starting in 1931, the tax on immigrants from the Far East would be increased from 50 guilders to 150 guilders (equivalent to over 200 national currency). The affiliated association requested the Ministry to negotiate via telegram on August 13th. Subsequently, the Ministry replied in telegram number 246, stating, "The original telegram has been received. We have already telegraphed the Consul-General in Java to investigate and negotiate." We express our gratitude that the Ministry has already instructed for negotiations, but the matter has not been fully resolved. On September 20th, we telegraphed the Ministry again, requesting the implementation of revolutionary diplomacy to achieve the goal of cancellation. We received telegram number 282 from the Ministry, stating, "The telegram has been received. According to the Consul-General in Java, the increase is not limited to immigrants from the Far East; it applies equally to all countries in Europe and America." The Ministry, recognizing the significant impact of this case on overseas Chinese, has again instructed the embassy in the Netherlands and the Consul-General in Java to continue negotiations and has also informed the Dutch embassy in China, requesting them to ask the Dutch government to fundamentally withdraw the proposal. The Ministry further reported that, according to a telegram from the acting chargé d'affaires in the Netherlands, although the Dutch side has proposed the increase in entry tax, it has not been fully decided. Furthermore, the Dutch Council of State has decided to increase the entry tax from 105 guilders to 150 guilders, to be implemented on January 1st of next year. It has been submitted to the Dutch government for review and is currently being sent by the Dutch Ministry of Colonies to the Council of State for further discussion, but it has not been fully decided. We deeply appreciate the Ministry's willingness to listen to the people's concerns and create benefits for overseas Chinese. However, with January 1st of next year fast approaching, the association is deeply concerned about whether the Ministry has a winning strategy. The number of overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies reaches over 2 million, with nearly 200,000 entering the country each year, a scale unmatched by other countries. If our country does not strive, other countries are unlikely to help. Consul-General Zhang in Java telegraphed that the increase is not limited to Europe and America, seemingly trying to justify the situation, but in reality, he is unaware of the severity of the matter. The association believes that the relevant ambassadors and consuls should seize the opportunity of the Far East, Europe, and America all being subjected to harsh taxes, uniting Japan and other friendly nations with deeper ties to the Dutch colonies to jointly protest. Furthermore, they should liaise with local overseas Chinese to request the Chinese members of the Council of State to vigorously oppose the increase and persuade other members of the Council to express sympathy. They should also explain to the Dutch Governor-General, publish in Chinese, English, and Dutch newspapers, the reasons why it is absolutely unacceptable to increase the tax again and again. Moreover, they should encourage Chinese organizations to simultaneously launch peaceful petitions. Only then will the goal be achieved. If the suffering of overseas Chinese is regarded as insignificant, with the acting chargé d'affaires and consul failing to act, and these remaining two months are wasted, the critical moment will be missed, ultimately abandoning the overseas Chinese in the Netherlands as if they have no one to turn to. Not only will the overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies decline, but the faith of overseas Chinese worldwide in their home government will also be shaken. We urgently plead and cannot express our concerns enough."</p>
<h3>Liu Shufan Presides Over the Savings and Remittance Bureau</h3>
<p>Continued Leave Not Approved</p>
<p>Liu Shufan, Director of the Postal Department of the Ministry of Transportation, previously suffered a cerebral hemorrhage while traveling from Beijing to Shanghai by plane due to the rapid change in climate during the descent, rendering him unable to attend to his duties. He repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry to resign from his concurrent positions. Wang Boqun, Minister of Transportation, believed that Liu was still competent in managing postal affairs and that a sudden replacement would cause obstacles in the process. Therefore, he only granted leave for treatment and did not approve his resignation. Now that Liu's leave is about to expire, although his condition has improved daily, his mental state has not fully recovered. He has again submitted a request to the Ministry for continued leave. It is understood that the Ministry believes that Liu can still oversee the affairs of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau from his residence in Shanghai, so they have not approved his request. Furthermore, Liu has already received instructions from the Ministry to first report to the Bureau for duty and plans to do so today. As for the position of Director of the Postal Department, it will continue to be held by Wei Yifu.</p>
<h3>Post Office Announces Small-Sum Money Orders</h3>
<p>From One Yuan to Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Headquarters yesterday issued a notice regarding the commencement of small-sum money orders, stating, "For the purpose of announcing the matter, in order to promote convenient remittances for the majority of postal agencies, a type of small-sum money order within the district has been specifically created and will be implemented starting on October 23rd of this year. The main points regarding the issuance of these money orders are listed below for public knowledge. This notice is hereby issued. (1) Small-sum money orders are currently limited to being issued by postal agencies to other postal agencies and post offices within the same postal district, or by post offices to postal agencies within the same district. (2) All postal sub-bureaus may also issue and cash small-sum money orders. (3) The amount of each small-sum money order is a minimum of one yuan and a maximum of ten yuan. Odd amounts less than one yuan will not be remitted. Each person may purchase or cash two small-sum money orders per day. (4) In addition to the fixed fee of five cents per small-sum money order, a remittance fee calculated as a percentage of the amount of the small-sum money order will also be charged (to compensate for water and other expenses). These two types of fees should be paid by the public in cash. For registered letters containing small-sum money orders, postage and registration fees should be affixed as usual with stamps. (5) No receipt will be issued for the issuance of small-sum money orders. A receipt for the registered letter containing the small-sum money order will be given to the remitter. The letter containing the small-sum money order must be registered. (6) Small-sum money orders must be placed by the issuing office into a specially prepared small-sum money order envelope provided by the post office. If the remitter wishes to also include a letter in the envelope, they may do so. However, the remitter must hand the letter to the issuing office staff for sealing before the post office issues the receipt or seal it themselves at the counter. The remitter may not take the small-sum money order envelope and mail it themselves later. (7) The holder of the small-sum money order, along with the envelope containing the money order, can go to the designated office to cash the remittance. The signature or seal of the person receiving the money is not required. (8) The small-sum money order envelope can only contain one small-sum money order, and the number must match the number on the small-sum money order. The cashing office uses this as part of the small-sum money order. Therefore, when the person receiving the money requests to cash the small-sum money order, if (A) the envelope is not presented at the same time, or (B) the envelope is not stamped with the date stamp of the receiving office as proof of delivery, all offices will refuse to cash the money order. (9) The full value of the original and duplicate remittance stamps affixed to the small-sum money order will be paid to the person receiving the money. If the original and duplicate stamps or the original money order are found to be altered, torn, or damaged in any way, or if the original and duplicate stamps are lost, the cashing will be stopped. (10) If the small-sum money order is not cashed at the cashing office within three months from the date of issuance, the money order will be considered invalid. If the small-sum money order is lost due to the negligence of the remitter or the person receiving the money, no duplicate will be issued. (11) If the small-sum money order cannot be cashed due to political reasons or other reasons, the post office will not be responsible for suspending the cashing. However, the person receiving the money may choose to delay the cashing or return the original money order along with the original envelope to the remitter. If the remitter wishes to cash in the money order, they may do so. However, the remittance fee paid previously will be reduced by one-half of one percent upon refund. (12) Once a small-sum money order has been cashed, the post office is not responsible for any further liability."</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau</h3>
<h3>Rewards Those Who Contributed to the North Huilu Road Project</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau proposed a case at the 47th county administration meeting regarding rewarding those who contributed to the labor recruitment and road construction of the North Huilu Road project. It was decided that the Construction Bureau should investigate and submit the case to the county government for forwarding to the Provincial Construction Department for awards. Subsequently, the Bureau sent letters to the various district offices, stating that the labor recruitment and road construction of the North Huilu Road project had already concluded. Those who had made meritorious contributions in commanding the labor recruitment and road construction should be awarded certificates in accordance with the Jiangsu Provincial Regulations on People Supporting Construction Projects, in order to provide encouragement. Therefore, the Bureau submitted the matter to the 47th county administration meeting, which decided that the Construction Bureau should investigate and submit the case to the county government for forwarding to the Provincial Construction Department for awards. We hereby request that your district chief provide detailed resumes of the contributors so that we can forward them to the upper levels.</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee Field Investigation of Baoshan Cotton Famine</h3>
<p>Due to the poor cotton harvest in the various townships of Baoshan County this autumn, with the best areas yielding no more than 30-40%, farmers are complaining bitterly. After County Chief Qiu reported the famine situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Department dispatched Zhang Feng from the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Xu Rongcai from the Department of Mining, and Xiao Zengrong from the Department of Finance to Baoshan yesterday morning. They met with Bei Jietai, Director of the county's Finance Bureau, and then Mr. Bei accompanied the three committee members, Zhang, Xu, and Xiao, to conduct on-site investigations of the cotton famine situation in various districts and villages such as Yangxing, Yuesheng, Liuhang, Guangfu, and Dachang. They assessed the harvest yields, filled out registration forms, and returned to the province to report on their findings for review.</p>
<h3>French Sailor's Brutal Murder of Xin Dingxiang Case</h3>
<p>District Party Headquarters, Trade Union, and Fellow-Provincial Association Initiate</p>
<p>Request for All Sectors to Jointly Form a Support Association</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the French sailor's brutal murder of Xin Dingxiang, all sectors have been aroused to resist and protest in unison, yet there is still no concrete assistance method. Several days ago, representatives from the Sixth District Party Headquarters in Zhabei, the Commercial Press Trade Union, and the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincial Association gathered at the Sixth District Party Headquarters to discuss the matter. The attendees included Wang Changyuan, representing the Sixth District Party Headquarters, Qian Hongcai, representing the Commercial Press Trade Union, and Xu Guanqing, representing the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow-Provincial Association. Wang Changyuan was elected as chairman, and Cheng Zhiliang was elected as recorder. Qian Hongcai reported in detail on his visit to Xin's family on the 18th to offer condolences and investigate the actual situation (see below). Subsequently, the following resolutions were passed: (1) The three organizations will initiate the formation of a Support Association for the Xin Dingxiang Brutal Murder Case. (2) A declaration will be issued to publicize the truth of the brutal murder case and arouse the attention of compatriots nationwide. The Commercial Press Trade Union will be responsible for drafting it. (3) The three organizations will initially raise 200 silver dollars to support Xin's family's daily expenses. (4) The Municipal Party Headquarters will be requested to promptly telegraph the National Government and consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the French authorities. There were several other important proposals, but they have not yet reached the stage for publication (omitted). The investigation process and factual report are as follows: Xin Dingxiang (erroneously reported as Ding Chang in the newspapers on October 18th), a Ningbo native, was 30 years old and worked as a sampan operator on sampan number 130, transporting passengers in the Yangshupu area. Around 7:00 PM on October 16th, Xin Dingxiang's sampan was docked at the Wayside Road pier. Two sailors from the French warship "Huamian Tekehaosha" (transliteration), which was docked in the Huangpu River, boarded Xin's sampan to cross to the French merchant ship "Xianlangsha" (transliteration) number 1, which was docked in the center of the river, to visit friends. They did not pay the fare upon boarding the ship and instructed Xin to wait for them to return to shore. After a long time, three sailors from the ship, along with the two French sailors from the "Huamian Tekehaosha" warship, intended to board the sampan to return to shore. Coincidentally, they noticed sampan number 1156, owned by the French Company and operated by Ge Amao, docked beside the ship. The three French sailors from the ship boarded Ge's sampan, and the two sailors from the warship also followed, crossing Xin's sampan to Ge's sampan, intending to avoid paying Xin's fare. Xin, seeing the situation was not good, immediately asked the French sailors behind him for the money. The sailor, angered by the situation, became unreasonable and began punching and kicking Xin on the spot. Xin, unaware of the sudden attack and unprepared, was struck and fell into the river, tragically drowning. Unexpectedly, after the assailant caused the incident, he did not attempt to rescue Xin but boarded another sampan, forcibly trying to go ashore. The sampan operator, seeing Xin being killed by the sailor for no reason, was filled with indignation and a sense of injustice. Upon reaching the Wayside Road pier, he gathered other sampan operators and stopped the French sailor, handing him over to Indian constable number 415. Unexpectedly, the Indian constable released the French sailor halfway, allowing him to escape without a trace. The other French sailor, seeing the situation was not good, fled to the Yangshupu police station of the water police. The head of the Yangshupu police station of the water police, believing that no one clearly identified the sailor, released him without authorization (this was only learned during yesterday's investigation). Later, the deceased's father, Hesheng, learned of Xin Dingxiang's tragic death and cried to the water police station. The police chief, Kaili, filed a report and instructed Western detective Pang Shihua and detective Deng Jiagen to investigate the scene. The sampan operators Zhu Gengsheng of number 795 and Ge Amao of number 1156, who witnessed the French sailor's actions, testified to the police station."</p>
<p>"According to Xin's father, Hesheng, he is 54 years old and still works as a sampan operator to make a living because he has no fixed assets. He has three sons, the deceased (Dingxiang) being the eldest. The second son, Dingsheng, is 10 years old, and the youngest son, Dinghua, is only 8 years old. Both younger sons need to be raised. He lives with his mother in Taogong Mountain, Ningbo. The deceased's wife (Dingxiang's wife), Ms. Xin Shi, is seven months pregnant and devastated by the news."</p>

<h3>Copper and Tin Guild's Premises Have Been Vacated</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Copper and Tin Guild yesterday, stating, "Regarding the case of the 28th Regiment's garrison troops under the Songhu Garrison Headquarters occupying your Guild's premises, our Chamber previously forwarded the situation to seek vacation and has been reporting the progress to you. We received instruction number 6122 from the Municipal Government, stating, 'The Songhu Garrison Headquarters' request has been approved, as well as your government's request number 940, stating, "The Municipal Chamber of Commerce requests that the troops be ordered to vacate the occupied premises of the Steel and Tin Guild, please review and reply." We dispatched personnel to investigate. We received a reply stating that 'we were dispatched to investigate the Copper and Tin Guild's premises occupied by the 28th Regiment's garrison troops and requested that they be returned for the Guild's office use.' We went to investigate on October 14th and found that the Guild's premises consist of three sections. Except for the front section, which is a residential house, the back hall is dark. Only the middle section and the side rooms are usable. The 28th Regiment's garrison items are completely piled up in the middle hall and the side rooms, with hundreds of rifles and many military uniforms and miscellaneous items. We discussed with Yu, the deputy officer of the 28th Regiment, to vacate the main room and side rooms of the middle section and move the stored items completely to the rear rooms. With this arrangement, the Guild will have a place for meetings and offices without hindering anything. As for complete vacation, there may not be a suitable location. Moreover, now that the war has ended, if the 28th Regiment goes to a fixed garrison location, there will be no need for a garrison office, and they will return to their respective camps and companies, which will likely not take long. We hereby report the investigation situation for your review.' In addition to ordering the garrison office to comply, we are replying to your inquiry and request that you inform the Guild accordingly. This is the order. Please inform the Copper and Tin Guild of this city.</p>

<h3>Zhou Heqing Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Sang and Made Merry with Prostitutes Before Death</p>
<p>His Suicide Note Claimed His Lifespan Had Ended</p>
<p>His Admonitory Words Were Exceptionally Moving</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a suicide case occurred at the Shangxian Inn, Room 55, No. 144 Donghui Lane, Fuzhou Road, involving a Suzhou dentist named Zhou Huwen, also known as Zhou Heqing. Before his death, he sang sorrowful songs filled with admonitory words. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Dentist Traveled Between Suzhou and Shanghai: Zhou Huwen, a Suzhou native with the courtesy name Heqing, was 27 years old and worked as a dentist, traveling between Shanghai and Suzhou several times a month. When he came to Shanghai, he always stayed at the Shangxian Inn. His father, Zhou Yusheng, was old and worked at the Tianlai Silk Factory on Gonghe Road, Zhabei, earning his own living and able to manage. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, Zhou Huwen arrived at the Shangxian Inn, Room 55, Fuzhou Road, wearing a checkered tweed Western suit of new design and carrying a leather suitcase. He seemed relaxed and showed no signs of sorrow, and he paid a dollar for the room.</p>
<p>Hired Prostitutes and Sang: After checking into the Shangxian Inn, Zhou Huwen went to see movies during the day and hired prostitutes to drink and sing with him at night, singing both southern and northern tunes. His behavior was abnormal. The day before yesterday afternoon, he asked the tea boy to buy stationery and locked himself in his room to write. At night, he hired three prostitutes and asked them to sing. Zhou joined in, clapping along. He then asked the prostitutes to play the qin while he sang. The guests in the neighboring rooms thought he seemed to have a mental problem, but because Zhou was usually quite humorous, they didn't mind.</p>
<p>Found Stiff, No Poison: Zhou Huwen waited for the singers to leave and asked the waiter to buy porridge and serve wine. After eating and drinking, he closed the door and went to bed. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Shangxian tea boy, thinking that Zhou was still sound asleep past noon, went to ask if he wanted to eat. He knocked on the door several times but received no response. Sensing something was wrong, he informed the front desk and pried open the door. He found Zhou lying stiff on the bed, lifeless. On the table was a letter addressed to the innkeeper, stating that it concerned suicide and asking them not to be alarmed. However, there was no evidence of poisoning, which was quite strange.</p>
<p>Better a Good Death Than a Bad Life: The Shangxian manager, seeing that Zhou was stiff, reported it to the police station. The detective ordered an investigation and found that Zhou had died without any poison near his body. They found two suicide notes, one addressed to his father, Zhou Yusheng, at No. 194 Minli Road, Zhabei, stating that he was unfilial and asking him not to be sad. He wrote that it was like raising someone for nothing; everyone must die at a hundred years old. He said that it was better a good death than a bad life and that his lifespan had ended and he was returning to his place. He asked them not to tell his aging grandmother to avoid upsetting her.</p>
<p>Impossible to Hide Poisoning: The other note was addressed to the public, containing satirical words. The detectives, to investigate the truth, carefully inspected the room and found an empty opium can in the toilet, confirming that he had taken poison. They then sent the body to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road for examination today. The satirical words written by Zhou before his death are recorded below:</p>
<p>An Admonitory Essay: I lament my youth, regretting that I did not listen to my parents' teachings and fell into the gutter. Growing up, I accomplished nothing, drifting like duckweed. I advise everyone not to imitate me, gambling and whoring. Thinking about it now, I regret it immensely. My deeds cannot be revealed. In this civilized world, the dirty deeds of society can be made public. Young men and women, beware of hidden traps! Avoid prostitute traps and honeyed words, for there are daggers hidden behind smiles. They are rotten people, hard to describe. I cannot reveal my affairs in detail. Now that my lifespan has ended, I have suffered enough. Do not be sad. Zhou Heqing's last words.</p>
<h3>Romantic Entanglements</h3>
<h3>A Case of Extortion</h3>
<p>Former Yunfei Employee Tang Yueqing</p>
<p>Entangled with Luo Yuying</p>
<p>Someone Steps Forward at the Inn</p>
<p>Extorting a Large Sum, Arrested</p>
<p>Luo Wangshi, a Ningbo woman over forty residing at No. 412 Broadway Road, Hongkou, has a young daughter named Yuying (also known as Lin Mei). She is in her early twenties, quite beautiful, and already engaged to someone. In May or June of this year, Luo Yuying suddenly became entangled with Tang Yueqing. Tang, 29 years old, used to work at the Yunfei Automobile Company but is now unemployed. He became intimate with the girl and often went to her home for secret talks. Their love grew stronger, and the girl lost her virginity to Tang. Although her mother knew about it, she thought that what's done is done and that family scandals should not be publicized, so she tolerated it with some scolding. On the 17th of this month, Yuying had an argument with her sister and mother and secretly ran away with 250 silver dollars. Luo Wangshi, after finding out, reported to the Chinese concession authorities, claiming that her daughter had</p>
<p>been seduced and abducted by Tang Yueqing and asking for an investigation. However, after Yuying ran away, she first went to the French concession, to the Zhongfa Clock Shop upstairs on Xixinqiao Street, to meet Tang's friend and then Tang himself. They spent the night together. The next morning, Yuying left Tang and went to her little sister's place to stay temporarily. On the 21st, Yuying again invited Tang to dinner at her aunt's place upstairs at the Fulai Machinery Factory on Pike Road. After dinner, they went outside and saw that</p>
<p>many people were following them. Wanting to avoid them, they went to the Suzhou Inn at No. 810 Zhejiang Road and opened Room 19. It was almost 11:00 PM when they sat down. A moment later, they heard a knock on the door. Yuying opened the door and suddenly saw her mother, Luo Wangshi, her brother, Luo Yuqing, and more than ten unknown men and women rush in. Yuqing immediately beat his sister several times, while the others guarded Tang and the girl. At that time,</p>
<p>a man stood out from the crowd, claiming to be named Wang Zhuqing, and told Tang that if he wanted to settle the matter, he would have to pay 400 or 500 dollars. Tang said he could not afford such a large sum. The negotiations continued until 12:00 AM without result. Wang and others took Tang and Yuying to the Nanjing Inn on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. Luo Wangshi and her son also went. Tang was guarded in Room 23 on the second floor, while the girl was placed in a room on the third floor, guarded by two women. Wang suddenly changed his tune and told Tang, "Now</p>
<p>you must pay 1,000 dollars to settle this matter. You can take Yuying away, but the minimum is 700 dollars." Tang could not raise the money and was guarded all night. The next morning, Tang telephoned Wang Xiangguan, a friend at the Yunfei Automobile Company on Huanlong Road, asking him to help. After receiving the call, Wang reported to the French police. The detective ordered an investigation, which was discovered by the group, and they scattered like birds and beasts.</p>
<p>Tang also took the opportunity to escape. The detectives entered the room and searched,</p>
<p>but could not find Tang. They only found Yuying and took her back to the police station. After Tang left the Nanjing Inn, he turned into Longmen Road in the Public Concession. He happened to look back and saw Wang Zhuqing and his accomplice Kang Jiabing chasing after him. Tang fled to the entrance of the Far Eastern Hotel on Dagu Road and was caught by Wang and others. While they were arguing, Chinese detective Qiu Sijiu and Indian constable No. 561 arrived and took Tang, Wang, and Kang to the Laoza Police Station. The detective, after learning the details, found that Wang and Kang</p>
<p>had committed extortion and ordered them to be detained. Qiu also transferred Yuying and Luo Wangshi from the French police station and temporarily detained them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Judge Xu Jiashi and Prosecutor Xu Mei took the bench to interrogate them. The police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated that the police were temporarily charging the two defendants, Wang and Kang, with attempted extortion under Article 370, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. However, if Article 370 could not cover their criminal behavior after questioning, they would be additionally charged. He then described the details of the case and stated that there were three points to note: (1) Could Wang arrest criminals in the concession without the permission of the concession authorities? (2) Could Jiang extort money from people in the capacity of a civilian? (3) Could Kang, as a detective's accomplice, join in the arrest? He said that the witnesses were present today and asked the judge to question them. Tang Yueqing testified that he met Luo through a friend and that he often went to her house. As for the events of the night before,</p>
<p>Wang and Kang were both present and the words about extorting money were spoken to me by Wang. Luo Yuying testified that she was guarded on the bed at the time, so she did not hear about the extortion. The testimonies of Luo Wangshi and Luo Yuqing were ambiguous. Yuqing only stated that he told Tang that since my sister had been defiled by you, her husband's family would not want to marry her again. You can</p>
<p>marry her through proper procedures. There was no instruction for Wang to extort a large sum of money. Xu A-gen, the tea boy from the Suzhou Inn, testified that Wang and Kang were present at the time. The two defendants denied extorting money from Tang, only admitting</p>
<p>that they had been to the Nanjing Inn. Lawyer Fan Gang was hired to defend them. Police lawyer Ru Bao-yi stated that the plaintiffs, Tang Yueqing, Luo Yuying, and Luo Wangshi, were temporarily detained by the police because they feared they could not be found. He asked the judge to ask Luo Wangshi if she still needed to sue Tang in the Local Court. If she still needed to sue, he asked for Tang to be released on bail; otherwise, he asked for a decision. Luo Wangshi then stated that this kind of</p>
<p>family scandal should not be publicized, so she would not file a lawsuit. Judge Xu reviewed the testimonies and adjourned the case for further questioning. The two defendants were remanded in custody. Tang, Luo Wangshi, and Luo Yuying were ordered to return for the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter</h3>
<h3>Who Committed Suicide Together, Examined Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Yingzhou Tries to Defend Himself</p>
<p>The Judge Said to Investigate According to Law</p>
<p>The case of Liu Zhoushi, wife of Liu Yingzhou, a clerk at the Meilun Silk Shop on Dongmen Road, and her twelve-year-old daughter, Yun'e, who both hanged themselves at their home at No. 5 Maoxing Lane, Fumin Road, was reported to the Local Court by the bailiff, Lu Yu, yesterday morning for examination. At the same time, the First Branch of the First District, based on the accusation by the deceased's brother, Zhou Qifeng, that Liu Yingzhou had abandoned and forced his sister to commit suicide, transferred the two parties to the court for interrogation. According to Liu Yingzhou's statement, he did not mistreat the woman after taking a concubine. His wife suddenly swallowed a gold ring on August 13 of last year. He sent her to Zhai Zhibu Hospital for treatment and then sent her home. In February of this year, with the persuasion of relatives, his wife and concubine were to take turns sleeping with him every night, with five dou of rice and fifteen yuan extra per month. Zhou then came to Shanghai and stayed at the Central Hotel near Xiaodongmen for several days. Later, she rented a house at Hongqiaotou in the city. At that time, I happened to take over the Meilun business and went to Suzhou. When I returned, my wife and daughter were again at the Central Hotel. According to the hotel, she swallowed red match heads after arriving at the hotel and was treated by Zhai Zhibu Hospital. After that, she moved to No. 5 Maoxing Lane, Fumin Road, near Dananmen. Unexpectedly, the second landlord liked to play mahjong. Zhou did not know the consequences and also played mahjong. She was arrested by the police before the Mid-Autumn Festival. I found out and tried to bail her out. Later, I hired a lawyer to defend her. As a result, she was fined twenty dollars, but I had spent a lot of money. Afterwards, I was angry and afraid of another conflict, so I didn't go to see her for five or six days. Unexpectedly, she swallowed a gold ring again. I immediately sent her to Zhai Zhibu Hospital for treatment. On September 30, her brother came and said that she and her daughter had swallowed gold rings again. It was during the Mid-Autumn Festival, so I rushed to send them both to Zhai Zhibu's place and asked him to keep them for a few more days because I needed to manage the accounts. But her four suicide attempts made me worry about the future, so I discussed with my friends Chen Hanzhang and lawyer Chao Kun about the aftermath. If we divorced, it would be a matter of face, so I asked the court to order a separation. At that time, she had not been discharged from the hospital. The hospital allowed her to leave because she was making trouble. The court scheduled a hearing for the 24th. The summons was delivered on the 22nd (the day of her death). According to the bailiff, she personally received the summons but refused to sign it. Unexpectedly, after receiving the summons, she and her daughter hanged themselves. But my daughter was very strange. Every time my wife attempted suicide, my daughter also attempted suicide with her. Therefore, my wife attempted suicide five times, and my daughter also attempted suicide five times, finally dying together. This must have been because she taught her to die together, but I didn't know when they died. Subsequently, Prosecutor Wu and others arrived at the scene to examine the bodies. It was confirmed that Liu Zhoushi and Liu Yun'e were both neatly dressed and had hanged themselves. The family was ordered to collect the bodies. The deceased's brother, Zhou Qifeng, asked to seek justice for his sister and niece. The official ordered an investigation and handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Wei Min</h3>
<h3>Incited His Son to Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>Court Investigation Results</p>
<p>Public Prosecution Has Been Filed</p>
<p>Wei Yancan, also known as Wei Min, a Hunan native who had served as the magistrate of Fujian County and the director of the Hebei Public Security Bureau, felt that life was difficult. He hired a sampan and led his wife, Xu, and son, Wei Tang, to jump into the Huangpu River. As a result, his wife and son both died, while Wei was rescued. The water patrol police referred Wei Yancan to the Local Court Prosecutor's Office, citing Article 284 of the Criminal Code (drowning his son as a result of premeditation) and Article 290 of the same law (inciting his wife to commit suicide), requesting a review. Prosecutor Wang Sixian approved Wei's release on bail. Now, the results of the case investigation are that Wei did not deliberately kill his son, so Article 284 is not established. As for his wife, the act of suicide was not considered inciting, so Article 290 is not applicable. However, Wei Tang's suicide was only at the age of ten and had no knowledge of suicide, so his suicide was not consent. Wei should be held responsible for inciting and assisting his son's suicide. Therefore, Wei has been indicted under Article 290, Section 1, and the indictment has been delivered.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the Women's Community</h3>
<h3>Towards Zhang Nai's Bigamy</h3>
<p>Member of the Women's Association Zeng Li Wenxiu</p>
<p>Speaks Up for You Yahao</p>
<p>The sensational case of Zhang Nai's bigamy was concluded by the Special Court on the 21st of this month, with a scheduled sentencing date. Ms. Li Wenxiu, a member of the Municipal Women's Association, spoke out for Ms. You Yahao in this case, and believing that the marriage officiant in Zhang Nai's bigamy case, Pastor Yu Zhizhai, had aided and abetted Zhang Nai's bigamy and shown favoritism, she sent a letter to Ms. You offering her opinion. The original letter is as follows: Ms. Yahao, I am truly outraged after reading the recent reports regarding Zhang Nai's bigamy case. It is already common for Christian pastors to use the power of imperialism to file</p>
<p>lawsuits and pressure commoners to incite discord. Now, Pastor Yu Zhizhai of the Moore Memorial Church dares to take advantage of his position in Shanghai, in full view of the public, to commit illegal acts and refuses to admit his fundamental mistakes. He claims to have considered the matter repeatedly, but he dared to act as a marriage officiant without consulting both parents, clearly aiding and abetting Zhang Nai's bigamy and showing favoritism. His actions must have been influenced by money, destroying your family's happiness and violating our party's principle of gender equality. This is the worst of all. You should also sue Pastor Yu Zhizhai in court and ask the Women's Association and the Party Department for assistance to achieve complete victory and to warn those who aid and abet bigamy. As a woman, I hate these imperialist running dogs and ungrateful men who destroy family happiness. I dare to offer my humble opinion.</p>
<h3>Two Groups Convene</h3>
<h3>A Conference to Support the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>Time: 2:00 PM Tomorrow</p>
<p>Address: No. 17 Chuan Highway</p>
<p>The Municipal Overseas Chinese Association and the Women's Association have recently joined forces to support Ms. Xiao Xin'an, who was insulted in the Netherlands. They have finalized various measures and scheduled a meeting for the 25th (tomorrow) at 2:00 PM at the Overseas Chinese Association, No. 17 Chuan Highway, North Sichuan Road, to discuss all aspects of supporting her. According to Mr. Hu of the Overseas Chinese Association, since the case needs to be expanded to attract the attention of the public at home and abroad, the Shanghai Support Association for the Xiao Case should be established immediately after the conference. Representatives should be elected from the conference to preside over the matter and work hard according to the methods decided by the conference. A suitable location should be determined as the address of the Support Association. If so, the support would be more practical than empty words. Mr. Hu also recorded the letter to various groups and the draft of the association's telegram to Ms. Xiao, and shared them with reporters, as follows:</p>
<p>To Various Public Groups: We are writing to inform you that the case of Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a teacher at the Chinese Peide School in Ambon Island, being insulted by the Dutch first and second mates of the Java Company's Chip Bee ship, has occurred and deeply angered the Chinese people. This matter not only insults Ms. Xiao personally but also concerns our national character and ethnic interests. All sectors of our country should rise up together and organize a support association for the Xiao case to provide practical assistance and to back up diplomacy. Our association has jointly issued a declaration, which has been published in newspapers. We hope that you will understand. We have scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM on the 25th of this month at No. 17 Chuan Highway. Please send representatives to attend the meeting and discuss the matter together. Thank you.</p>
<p>Telegram to Ms. Xiao: Please forward to Ms. Xiao Xin'an of the Overseas Chinese Peide School through the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Makassar. Respectfully, Ms. Xiao's enthusiasm for overseas Chinese education and her solo journey across the oceans, resulting in her being insulted by the Dutch first and second mates of the Chip Bee ship, has filled our association with righteous indignation. How can we face Ms. Xiao or our entire nation if we do not avenge this humiliation? Our association has a duty to not remain silent. On September 26, we telegraphed the Nanjing Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee and the Ministry of Education, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make serious representations to the Dutch government. Since this matter concerns our national character, the spirit of the nation, the personality of women, and the progress of overseas Chinese education, we should unite patriotic people and enthusiastic groups at home and abroad to respond in unison. On one hand, our association will jointly form a strong support association in Shanghai to discuss countermeasures. We believe that there is still hope and that we will not sit idly by and watch those beasts, the first and second mates, go unpunished. Avenging Ms. Xiao's humiliation is avenging the humiliation of our entire nation. We issued a declaration on October 19, which was published in the newspapers and need not be repeated. We will announce the methods after the meeting and send a letter separately. We hope for your understanding and guidance. Signed, the Chinese Overseas Chinese Association.</p>

<h3>The Foreman is Accused of Murder, Case Awaits Retrial</h3>

<p>Dong Dexing, a worker at the Yihua Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, accused foreman Wang Jiekui, Wang Guofang, Wang Sibao, and others of attempted murder in the Special District Local Court. The case has been opened and tried several times. Plaintiff Dong Dexing testified that Wang Jiekui had a grudge against him and that on August 6, seven people beat him. Attorney Chen Tingrui represented Wang Jiekui and stated that Dong had reported to the Yangshupu Police Station that twenty or thirty people had beaten him, which was inconsistent with his testimony. The court ordered a retrial and summoned the chief of the Yangshupu Police Station to court. Yesterday morning, Judge Cheng Shangfeng took the bench in the Fifth Criminal Court. West Police Chief Qu Laofu of the Yangshupu Police Station testified that Dong Dexing had reported to the police station that twenty-three people had beaten him. He was indeed injured at the time and was sent to Tongren Hospital. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang and Ding Rong, questioned Qu Laofu several times. Dong Dexing testified that he had only said that seven people had beaten him at the police station, and that twenty or thirty people were watching. Judge Cheng asked if he knew who had beaten him. Dong replied that he did not know. The defendants' attorney, Chen Tingrui, rose and gave a brief statement. The court ordered a retrial. Wang Jiekui posted 8,000 yuan bail.</p>
<h3>Robbers</h3>
<h3>Investigated for Involvement in Extortion and Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Sent to Court for Trial Yesterday</p>
<p>Victim Denies Being Extorted</p>
<p>Shang Wu, the chief of the Chinese detectives at the Exchange Concession Police Station, successively arrested three robbers, Yang Lian'en, Wang Guoliang, and Ding Jinfang, and also arrested Chen Miaoqing for suspicion of aiding and abetting the fleeing accomplice Chen Ronggen. The details of the referral to the Special District Local Court for trial and detention have been published in this newspaper. Detective Shang's investigation revealed that Yang and Wang had written threatening letters in September and delivered them to Shao Yanshan, manager of the Tongyu Money Shop on Tianjin Road, in an attempt to extort 5,000 dollars. Ding was related to the case of Zhou Zongyun, a Cantonese accountant at the Hongyu Cotton Yarn Company at No. 81 Beijing Road, being kidnapped for ransom in front of his residence at No. 567 Dagu Road at 9:15 AM on January 14 of last year. Yesterday morning, the plaintiff was summoned along with Yang and the other four people to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang rose to present the case and stated that the defendant Ding Jinfang, also known as Ding Afu, had been confessed by Liu Arong, who had already been executed by firing squad after being arrested and convicted by the New Gate Police Station. Liu was arrested for the kidnapping of Zhou Zongyun. Wang Mingdong and Ma Laifa, who were arrested at the same time as Liu, have also been interrogated and sentenced to life imprisonment in various places. The police investigated the plaintiff Zhou Zongyun and Zhou stated that Ding Jinfang was indeed named Ding Afu and had previously been his chauffeur. Shao Yanshan stated that he was the manager of Tongyu Money Shop and that the defendant Wang Guoliang, also known as Aqing, had previously been his chauffeur. He was hired for a few months because he was childlike, but he was laid off. The current chauffeur, A'er, was recommended by Aqing. He had never received any threatening letters or phone calls requesting loans. If this had happened, he would have reported it to the police. Plaintiff Zhou Zongyun testified that Ding Jinfang, also known as Afu, had previously been his chauffeur. He did not know if Afu was present when he was kidnapped. After Judge Sun Yuan reviewed the testimonies, he ordered the defendants to be detained and the case to be investigated further.</p>
<h3>Quarrel Over Rent Leads to Violent Assault</h3>
<p>Gu Shunqi Uses a Chisel as a Weapon</p>
<p>Tang Renchu Suffers a Serious Abdominal Injury</p>
<p>Tang Renchu, an unsentimental carpenter from Wusong over the age of 50, residing at No. 19 Yangjiabang Road behind the Toyo Garden on Diswei Road in Hongkou, demanded eight yuan in rent for two months from his tenant, Gu Shunqi, from Chongming. A quarrel suddenly arose, and they fought each other. Gu held a chisel and stabbed Tang in the right abdomen, causing a wound about an inch deep and a large flow of blood. Someone called the police from the First Branch of the Fifth District. The police officer arrived and sent the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The perpetrator, Gu Shunqi, was arrested on the spot and taken to the station for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Woman Attempts Suicide by Jumping into the River, Rescued</h3>
<p>Foolish and Pitiful to Take One's Life Over Trivial Matters</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, a young woman at the No. 210 sampan at the Hankou Road Customs Pier asked to be ferried to the Chunjiang Pier on the opposite bank, agreeing to pay ten cents. As they rowed to the center of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Her body sank and then resurfaced. The sampan rower, Rong Wenlai, managed to rescue her and sent her to the Water Patrol Police Station. She stated that her name was Wang Abao, 26 years old, from Zhenjiang. She had no relatives in Shanghai and was working as a domestic helper at the home of Pan Liwu at No. 224 Jingxing Lane, Chenjiabang Vegetable Market, Avenue Edward VII. The hostess was my younger sister. Yesterday, I argued with the hostess over cooking vegetables. I was furious and secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. I walked to my foster mother's house on Pike Road to complain. When I arrived at the door, the poison took effect, and I fell down. My foster father, Zhou Zhongshe, hired Dr. Wang to give me an injection to save my life. I stayed there overnight. This morning, I left without saying goodbye, thinking that life was no fun at all, so I tried to die for the second time. The chief officer verified the information and ordered the bailiff, Wu Rongsheng, to send her to her employer's home, Pan Liwu, to be taken in.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Merchants Proceed with the Shangyu Dyke Project</h3>
<p>Urging and Soliciting Donations</p>
<p>The Western Section Dyke Project in Shangyu, Zhejiang Province, is related to the neighboring counties of Yuyao, Cixi, Yin, and Zhen, and Shaoxing. The reconstruction project to prevent floods is urgent. On September 18, a meeting was held at the Central Trust Company Assembly Hall to discuss the implementation methods, and a large sum of money was raised on the spot. Yu Yiyuan was appointed as the person in charge. The dyke donation books were distributed to the donors on file. The details were published in the previous newspaper. It is now reported that the general office is proceeding with the dyke construction in order, and that materials and contracting all require money. Most of the donors have not yet paid the money, and the office was forced to send a letter to the donors and enthusiastic elders of the same village, urging them to contribute so that the collection of funds can be completed early. The original letter stated: (Omitted above) Before, because the dyke project must be started immediately, the funds were very urgent. Now, because the stone work has been contracted, it is even more urgent to pay the funds. Therefore, we are sending another letter to inform you that we must earnestly proceed with enthusiasm and urge those who have not yet donated to donate quickly, and those who have already donated to collect and remit the funds quickly to meet the needs. The earth dams in the Huangjiayan and Sunjiadu areas are small, and this year's outer river tide is even more terrible than last year. If they unfortunately collapse, the disaster will be unpredictable. It is planned to start construction as soon as possible. (Omitted below)</p>

<h3>The Star Theater, Soon to Open</h3>
<p>Located in Jiangyuan Lane, Xinzha</p>
<p>In recent years, the Xinzha area has seen a thriving population and business community. Recognizing the lack of proper entertainment venues in the area, business figures Zhang Changfu, Yao Yuyuan, and film industry figures Zhang Shichuan, Zhang Juchuan, and American merchants residing in Shanghai have jointly invested in establishing a magnificent and upscale cinema. The location is at the intersection of Park Road and Qingdao Road (i.e., Jiangyuan Lane, Xinzha). Construction has been underway for over a year and is now nearing completion. It is named the Star Grand Theater and registered in the United States. The theater has a large capacity and can accommodate over a thousand seats, all designed in the latest European and American styles. The projectors and sound equipment were ordered from the United States at great expense. The policy for screening films is unique. It is said that European and American sound and silent films will be selected. Detailed explanations will be provided when screening sound films, and beautiful music will be paired when screening silent films. The official opening is imminent, and the screening of the blockbuster sound film "The Love Parade," which has been a sensation in Shanghai and selling out continuously, is expected. It is said that this film will not be screened publicly in Shanghai after its screening at this theater.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Perfume Shop</h3>
<p>Detectives Investigate and Arrest Two Robbers</p>
<p>Yesterday at 6:30 PM, four robbers suddenly rushed into the Daichunlin Perfume Shop on Xinzha Road, each wielding a pistol, intending to rob a large sum of money. Unexpectedly, the shop's daily income was very meager. The robbers only managed to steal 160 silver dollars before fleeing. At that time, Detective Zhang Yuchang of the Xinzha Police Station happened to pass by and noticed the robbers' flustered appearance. Suspecting they were criminals, he wanted to search them, but fearing he was outnumbered, he summoned a policeman from post number 1833 nearby to assist in the arrest. Seeing that the approaching men were police officers, the robbers fled eastward. The detectives bravely pursued, and to gain the upper hand, fired two shots. The robbers then stopped, and the detectives caught up and apprehended two of them. They are scheduled to be handed over to the court for trial this morning.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read the article in your newspaper's "Shipping Industry Communications" column on the 21st of this month, regarding the Shanghai shipping industry's initiative to reclaim the customs inspection vessel to be operated by Chinese personnel. I was surprised to find that it stated that I, Liu Fupei, did not submit a formal certificate to the Shipping Industry Association. I would like to clarify that I have previously sent my resume and certificates to the Shipping Industry Association for filing with the Ministry, and I had already sent all the credentials directly to the Shipping Industry Association to be forwarded. The report in your newspaper seems to be based on inaccurate information. I am writing to request that you investigate and make a correction. Sincerely, Liu Fupei, October 23rd.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I recently read a report in your newspaper's "Local News" section about a robbery on a regular Pinghu steamer, which contains many inaccuracies. The routes of the steamers of our Bureau do not pass through Jin Siliang Bridge from Shanghai to Pinghu, and there were no robberies on any of the steamers traveling back and forth on the previous day. As this matter concerns the business of our Bureau, we request that you make a correction as soon as possible. Sincerely, Pinghu Minnan Steamship Bureau, October 22nd, 1920, to the Chief Editor of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Since the establishment of the Republic of China after the revolution, nineteen years have passed. War has been frequent, and disasters have occurred repeatedly. The people's livelihood is in decline, and starvation is widespread. It is not easy to live and work in peace, and displacement is common. Recently, the disasters in Liaoning and the Northwest have been reported extensively in the newspapers, filling pages and causing unbearable grief. Although the Southeast is known as a prosperous region, bandits run rampant, the people are struggling, and kidnapping is rampant, making it difficult to take a step. As a result, the construction of productive enterprises has not been achieved, and the economic situation is on the verge of collapse. The reasons for this are numerous, but the main reason is undoubtedly the manipulation and exploitation by the imperialist powers. The lack of attention by the Chinese people to the issues of people's livelihood and economic production is also a major cause. Therefore, the unemployed cannot find employment, and those who are employed find it difficult to maintain their employment. Society is unstable, and there is a surplus of labor. If this situation continues without a solution, it will gradually lead to economic collapse and social unrest, further exacerbated by the promotion of the Communist bandits and warlords and the intervention of the imperialist powers. Even if one does not want to perish, is it possible to avoid it? Our institute, seeing this situation, intends to conduct a thorough investigation of the current state of the people's livelihood in our country and compile statistics to identify the root causes and study ways to remedy them. This will provide a basis for systematic planning and targeted solutions, avoiding the futility of doing things in the wrong way. This will clarify the needs of society, solve employment problems for those seeking a living, and provide reference materials for social scientists. However, due to the vast size of our country and the large population, it is impossible to conduct a nationwide survey due to economic and time constraints. Considering that all Chinese people are patriotic, and relying on the wisdom of the masses, we are launching a widespread solicitation of information. The scope of the solicitation is briefly described as follows: (1) The status of the forestry industry and the government's investment and organizational structure. (2) The living conditions of the people and the comparison of their income and distribution. (3) The number of unemployed and the reasons for their unemployment. (4) An overview of productive enterprises. (5) The export and types of products. (6) An overview of social enterprises. (7) The establishment of vocational education. (8) The comparison of the area of barren mountains and plains. The above is only a brief summary. In general, our institute welcomes all questions and research data related to the people's livelihood. We have long admired your newspaper as a leader of the masses and are deeply aware of the social situation. We are writing to request your guidance to assist our research and provide reference materials. The people will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Sincerely, National Livelihood Survey Institute, October 20th, 1920, to the Shen Bao.</p>

<p>Father: Last night, you were in my car. Where were you and who were you with?</p>

<p>Father: Please tell those male classmates not to forget those powder papers and powder boxes in the car in the future.</p>
<p>Woman: My love, if you have any pain or troubles, I am willing to share them with you.</p>

<p>Customer (as the waiter places a bowl of soup on his table): I don't think this bowl of soup is hot enough. Please bring me a hot one.</p>
<p>Waiter: Sir, you haven't even tasted it yet. How do you know it's not hot? You can only know after you've eaten it.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Northeast United Games</h3>
<p>— Lan Huang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xueliang has always been enthusiastic about supporting sports, and he has generously donated funds to promote it in a practical manner. Therefore, there are many athletes in the Northeast who are physically strong and have achieved great results in sports. Mr. Zhang's effort and practice have their own unique qualities. Recently, the Northeast specially united athletes from the four provinces of Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Rehe to hold a sports meet. With the assistance of the authorities of the four provinces, preparations were completed in two months, and the finals were held at the Beiling Northeast Sports Field starting on the 10th of this month for three days. My friend, Mr. Zhu, sent me a letter telling me about the proceedings of the meeting, which contained many interesting stories. Due to space limitations, I can only select the main points to provide readers with talking points.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Alerting Speech: After the opening ceremony and formalities on the first day, the organizing committee reported on the preparations and stated that the competition was initiated entirely because of the Far Eastern Games, hoping that everyone would maintain sportsmanship. Then, Honorary Chairman Zhang Xueliang delivered a speech, stating that he deeply hoped that everyone would not be discouraged by the failure of the Far Eastern Games, nor be complacent by the victory of the National Games. They should practice diligently so that they would improve day by day and reach a higher level. After Mr. Zhang finished speaking, he and his wife, Ms. Yu Fengzhi, sat on the stage to watch the start of the sports events.</p>
<p>Total Number of Male and Female Athletes: Most of the schools participating this time were from the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, especially Liaoning. Rehe was unable to participate due to the long distance and difficult transportation. The athletes were divided into four groups: (1) Male Intermediate Group, about 700 people; (2) Male Advanced Group, more than 80 people; (3) Female Intermediate Group, more than 70 people; (4) Female Advanced Group, more than 160 people. The total number was 1,060, including 9 people from the Dalian Chinese YMCA and 8 individual participants, all of whom were active, strong, and reputable members of various schools. Each school also formed a cheering squad to boost morale. The cheers and applause of the spectators echoed in the field.</p>
<p>Results of the Three-Day Competition: The audience was extremely enthusiastic during the three days, with tens of thousands of spectators each day. The audience paid close attention to the male athlete Liu Changchun and the female athlete Sun Guiyun, vying to be the first to see them. However, Sun Guiyun felt slightly unwell in the afternoon of the first day, so she temporarily withdrew from the 100-meter final. Fortunately, there were no events for Ms. Sun on the second day. On the third day, she regained her spirit and competed hard. She broke the national record in the high jump with a height of 1.25 meters and also won the championship in the 200-meter final. It was a pity that her performance was slightly inferior to her usual level due to fatigue. In total, there were 87 events in the three-day competition. The champions in the team events were: Male Advanced Group, Northeast University; Male Intermediate Group, Northeast Special District First Middle School; Female Advanced Group, Northeast Special District Public Sports Field; Female Intermediate Group, Special District First Girls' Middle School. As for the individual results, Xiao Dinghua, an athlete from Northeast University, won the most titles with four first places and won the championship of the Male Advanced Group, earning him fame throughout the country. Liu Changchun, who is famous throughout the country, tied with Zhang Lingjia for second place. The first place in the Male Intermediate Group was Wang Shaoye, and the first place in the Female Advanced Group was Wu Meixian, who won four first places and won the championship. Liu Jingzhen was second, and Sun Guiyun, who is well-known, finished fourth. The first place in the Female Intermediate Group was Xie Cilan.</p>
<p>Breaking Eight New Records: The highlight of this conference was that five athletes broke eight new records: (1) Liu Guxue's 10,000-meter long-distance run; (2) Wu Meixian's 50-meter high jump and long jump; (3) Xiao Hua's high hurdle triple jump; (4) Ma Zijun's women's shot put; (5) Sun Guiyun's high jump. The reason for creating new records is due to the efforts of the Northeast authorities to promote sports and the students' hard work. I sincerely hope that all parts of the country will work hard in this area, so that the future will be prosperous, and it will not only be the Northeast that is beautiful in the front.</p>
<p>Awards Ceremony and Closing Ceremony: After the finals were completed on the afternoon of the third day, the bells rang six times. Mr. Zhang Xueliang and his wife, along with Central Representative Wu Tiecheng, attended the ceremony to present the awards. First, Mr. Zhang gave a speech, the general idea being that the failure in the Far East was an international disgrace, and he hoped that everyone would not be proud of the victory of this conference, but should bravely pursue and strive to win glory for the country in the future. There were more than 200 awards, all kinds of exquisite and beautiful. It took Mr. Zhang half an hour to present the awards before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Interesting Play of Seizing a Box</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>My relative, Mr. Guo, lives near Houjia Road in the city. Yesterday, he came to visit and we talked over wine. Mr. Guo told me an interesting story about someone greedy picking up a lost item. I am recording it here to amuse readers. There was a Mr. Hongmu Wood next door. One evening, two groups of workers finished their work and went out for a walk. It was already dusk, and the pedestrians were gradually sparse. Suddenly, they saw a tin box in a dark corner of the road. The box was tightly locked and seemed to have been lost by a passerby. They tried to lift it, and it was very heavy, as if it contained treasures. Jia was overjoyed and hurriedly took it home, intending to claim it as his own. Yi was furious and said that he had discovered the box first, and in principle, the items inside should not be taken by Jia. They quarreled endlessly and then started fighting. Then, a man like Lu Zhonglian came out to mediate, saying that the benefits should be shared equally. Everyone agreed that some of the profit should be set aside for a feast. Jia and Yi both agreed and happily tried to open the box. To their shock, what appeared before their eyes was the corpse of a baby, naked and without a single thread. There were no other items. As the mysterious curtain was lifted, Jia and Yi were both very frustrated and repeatedly cursed their bad luck. They still tried to shirk responsibility and refused to bear the burden of discarding the corpse. Finally, the two men each grabbed one end of the box and carried it to the trash can. The empty joy dissipated like a breeze, and the mistress of the wood workshop, considering it unlucky for such people to bring a corpse back for no reason, ordered Jia and Yi to light incense and candles in the courtyard and kowtow. This silly and interesting play thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Picking Up Autumn Sounds</h3>
<p>— Jianqiu</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's performance in the Qing Shuang Sword drama as Shen Xuezhen is very fitting. The crying spirit in the Erhuang reverse tune is novel and melancholic. Once you listen to it, you can't help but want to listen to it again. At the end, the first level of the enemy is bright red. The two words "red" and "bright" are extremely fast, and the cavity turns three times, letting go of one eye and immediately connecting to the next sentence, creating the effect of pearls falling on a jade plate. In the scene of persuading her to marry and entrusting her son, she is lively and alert at first, and then deeply saddened and solemn. The change is very expressive. In the next scene, when Cai Yu arrives, Duan'er clings to her clothes and refuses to let go. The resolute festival woman and the affectionate young child are portrayed vividly and thoroughly. During the performance in Beijing in the past, there were people in the audience who were moved to tears. The scene of stabbing Fang is very similar to the scene of stabbing Tang, except that she is not beheaded in the boudoir but beside the tomb, giving birth to a good scene of singing and running while worshiping the tomb. As for the expression of stabbing Fang, she falls down, which is roughly the same as stabbing Tang, but when Yao Po knocks on the door, she is extremely frightened at first, and then the calmness of her Shen Ji Zhen is something that stabbing Tang does not have. Others, such as the sentence "mound board" in the tomb sacrifice, have as many as forty or so words. Yanqiu sings this in a melodious and tortuous manner, with the aura of an ant bead and nine twists, which is truly rare and valuable. As the poet Jian Cheng said, "Being able to respond to the rhythm of the strings is truly a skill, pouring out the feelings of a beautiful woman and a chivalrous heart," which is indeed not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The Mei Concubine's drama is one of Yanqiu's masterpieces. The repertoire is recorded as follows: Gao Lishi sent an envoy to select a beauty, Jiang Caiping entered the palace to receive special favor, the relationship was as close as the Yuanzong Feast, and she was ordered to be named Shang. The King of Han accidentally returned after kicking the Fengxi with anger, and secretly connected with the Phoenix. The third call did not reach the point of personally rejoicing in the sheep cart, and the plum envoy hoped to whip the angry horse. The Orchid Terrace was dismissed from the feast, and the dance made a startled swan. The box was ordered to join the alliance, and Taizhen entered the service. The moth's eyebrows were jealous, and the emperor's son forgot his feelings. He sent Nian Nu to move his grace to another hospital, and called Lishi to solve the problem. No one avoided his face and secretly traced the moonlit forest. He was heartbroken and grasped the pen, relying on the car. The chaos changed, and the fisherman was shocked. The sly summer was deeply in love, and the magpies and swallows competed for spring in the floss pavilion. The envoy returned the pearl to Changmen, and the comb washed his face. He was shocked by the distant yard of singing and drums, and Ge Shuhan abandoned his armor in the drunken battlefield. The Hu horses hissed and the flute clusters were in the purple palace. The hot spring water flowed from the jade buried in the plum roots. Guo Ling waved his halberd to settle in Western Beijing, and the emperor greeted him sadly in the Southern Inner City. He was thinking about it day and night, and the people were not as good as before. Is it true or a dream? Soul, come home.</p>
<p>The National Government, in order to comfort the soldiers at the front and provide relief to the Liaoxi flood disaster, requested Yanqiu to perform a drama to raise funds through Mr. Li Shizeng. Yanqiu had agreed and decided to go to Beijing as soon as the contract with the Grand Theater expired. Yanqiu still has a chivalrous and righteous heart to open a new record in the new capital. There will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Roman Art Observation Notes (IV)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>The upper part of Raphael's tomb originally had two statues: Raphael on the right and his lover on the left. Later, Napoleon took them away, and one is still missing. The structure of the tomb has a balanced beauty. A sarcophagus is placed in the hole directly below his statue, allowing one to see the front of the coffin. Tourists respect this tomb more than other popes' tombs because Europeans can all tell the story of the painter Raphael.</p>
<p>This shrine was built in 27 BC before the birth of Jesus and is the oldest of the large buildings still existing in Rome today. When St. Peter's Church was built five hundred years ago, Michelangelo designed it according to the top of this church. The Pantheon in Paris also imitated this style, so this shrine is extremely valuable in Roman ancient architecture. After visiting this church, look at Michelangelo's famous sculpture, Moses, nearby.</p>
<p>The Statue of Moses is in the Pietro Church. The exquisite carving of this statue is Michelangelo's proudest work in his life. He studied the original Greek sculpture for five years when he carved this statue. It is twelve feet tall, and the expression of muscles and folds is very profound. There are also three statues above the statue of Moses, which were made more than a hundred years after Michelangelo. Compared with the rest, the Moses statue is more majestic, and the sculptures made later are far inferior to Michelangelo's works.</p>
<p>(1) Capitoline Church This church was destroyed by fire in the thirteenth century and rebuilt by Michelangelo in the early fifteenth century. It is divided into two parts, left and right, and has now been converted into an antiquities museum. Outside the museum is a large square in the center of which is an ancient bronze equestrian statue. This statue is the ancestor of modern equestrian statues, and equestrian statues sculpted later were influenced by this statue. The original work was gilded, but many parts have been peeled off, and the colors are ancient and mottled. The posture is also very natural. The right pavilion displays 26 rooms of famous Greek sculptures, collected by the current Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Therefore, the part displaying this Greek sculpture is called the Mussolini Museum. Italy has been tidying up and preserving its art for the past eight years in a very orderly manner. Since last year, public museums have abolished tickets and opened them to the public, attracting people from all over the world to visit. The left pavilion displays famous works in history, including a bronze statue of a she-wolf suckling two children. This tells the story of the twin ancestors of Rome being raised by a she-wolf. It is said to have been shipped in from Greece in the sixth century BC. The two children below were added later. Although this is not purely Roman art, the fierce and powerful posture of the wolf is quite symbolic of the national character of ancient Rome. The Italians use this statue as a trademark everywhere, and you can often see it in Italy. At the exit of the museum, there are still two wolves kept there, so that visitors can recall the sculpture even more.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (300)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Tears Fall on All Sides, Sad Red Love, Hearts Are Captured, Lingering Green Intentions</p>
<p>That young master Yin wanted to find a way to get the two hundred dollars from the mouth of Geng Sheng or on Geng Sheng. He thought that Sherlock Holmes' detective skills were all lies to fool his mother, and he wanted to find this two hundred dollars. He found Geng Sheng that evening and said, "Hey, Geng Sheng, my father is not at home. I'm going out in a carriage today." Geng Sheng had no choice but to agree because he was the young master, and of course he could ride his father's carriage. He asked, "Where are you going?" The young master said, "Never mind, it's also good for you. I'll tell them to give you a little more carriage fare." Geng Sheng thought he was smart and said, "I know. Are you going to have a good time with the ladies?" The young master said, "That's right. You can't talk about it at home." Geng Sheng said, "Of course not." He thought that since the master had gone to Hangzhou, he had been idle for the past two days, and he hadn't been able to get any carriage fare for a long time. Since the young master was also going to have a good time with the ladies, why should I expose him and shoot myself in the foot? So he said, "It's still early, it's best to go at seven or eight o'clock." The young master said, "I'm also going to see a friend in Meishou Lane on Baker Road. Hitch up the carriage." When they arrived at Baker Road, he said in a low voice, "Hey, Geng Sheng, I know my grandfather's mistress' residence is here. Can you lead me to recognize it?" Geng Sheng hesitated a bit. He thought, "The master told me not to talk about it to anyone at home, so how can I rashly lead the young master there? Wouldn't this secret be broken by me? He's going to blame me when he comes back." So he said, "That place is not easy to go to." The young master said, "What's the harm in going? Grandpa used to hide it from the family, but now he's told us himself. Otherwise, how would I know his mistress' residence is here? Now we're going to merge the residences soon. In the future, when we pick up this mistress, the master might send me there. Let me go and recognize the door first, so I won't make a mistake in the future. Besides, I'm only going to look at the door, not going inside to see the mistress. I won't tell the master, so no one will know." Geng Sheng thought that the reason why he had to hide it from the family before was because the family didn't know about it and was especially afraid that the tigress would come and make a scene. Now that the master had told them himself and even the young master knew that it was near Baker Road, it was alright for him to just look at the door and not go upstairs. It wouldn't matter if he took him to see it, and he could get the carriage fare from him the next time he had a good time with the ladies. So he agreed to lead him to the door of the master's mistress' residence. After turning from Baker Road, the carriage stopped less than a dozen houses away. Geng Sheng said, "It's in this alley, the fifth house. Just look at the door, don't go in. If the master comes back and complains that I brought the young master here, I won't be able to handle it."</p>

<h3>Gold Market Strongly Surges</h3>
<p>A large number of buyers entered the market, and the market soared. Yesterday, the 23rd, the price of standard gold rose sharply, and the trend was active and rapid. The progress all the way was almost a pattern of big rises and small corrections, and it had already broken through the 80 tael mark. The front and rear markets had a difference of more than five taels. Looking back, the difference was only one to two taels. The short sellers suffered heavy losses and had to resist the advance, and some even turned bullish. Therefore, the demand was quite strong, while the sellers waited and watched. As for foreign exchange, it was also quite strong, and the industry tended to climb forward, with Yufeng, Yongfu, and Changwei being the most active. The listed prices were repeatedly reduced twice. The front market saw Tai Run, Tai Heng, Yuan Xie, Yu Dade, Chengyi, Feng Yongfu, Chang Yuan Heng, and others all buying in, while only Da Yuan Mao, Yong Shun Li, and Wan Xing, among others, had a supply exceeding demand. The exchange houses sold slightly, and the overseas silver market showed a decline, so people's minds were uplifted. Therefore, the opening in the morning was high, and afterwards, it almost penetrated the sky. At almost noon, it soared by more than five taels, reaching beyond the 80 tael mark. The exchange further reduced by half a point. The industry was constantly settling, especially the Bank of Communications absorbing spot goods. Fuchang then switched to US dollars. In the afternoon market, Yuan Cheng, Yong Yuan Heng, Fuchang, and others bought in a lot, while Wan Xing Shunli and hedgers sold. The market sentiment was extremely strong, and the Bank of Communications absorbed spot silver again, so the rise was unstoppable, reaching more than 85 taels. The exchange became tighter. The selling price of one-month British gold by banks was only 171.25. Therefore, today's silver bars are predicted to continue to decline.</p>
<p>The evening opening was high and continued to rise. The opening price of standard gold for December in the morning was 574 taels and 9 qian, an increase of 2 taels and 7 qian (the gross price initially fluctuated between 4 taels and 4.67 taels). The large silver bars fell back by one-eighth, and the silver price was the same. The exchange rate increased by one-sixteenth. The market was stable. There were sales in the United States, so the Shanghai market became strong. Afterwards, it rose from 74.5 taels to 76.2 taels. Dade Cheng Yuan Cheng, Tai Xing, Tai Kang Run, and others bought in a lot, and the exchange market also rose by three points, absorbing one tael, two qian, and seven fen of gold for the first day of January. Then, British gold for December was offered at 1725, but then suffered a slight setback of one tael and four taels and eight or nine qian. After the first order was announced, it shrank by 125, with US dollars at 25 and Japanese gold adding one fen, the price was 75.78 taels, and then it fell back by two taels. Soon after, Fuchang, Yuan Heng, and others chased in. Internal exchanges became more firm. Taiwan absorbed 1725 for November, and North Korea appeared at one tael, two qian, and seven fen, 9375. The wheat firm offered British gold for January at 173125, so at 10 o'clock it rose to six taels and a half, then retreated to five taels and five or six qian. In an instant, the wind rose and the clouds surged, jumping more than three taels. The buyers were still strong, and the banks were counter-trading British gold for March and April at 1725. Shanghai offered 171875 for November and was absorbed by the Bank of Communications with cash, with the price being 583 taels. This was Fuchang's exchange of US dollars, which made people even more excited, reaching 78 taels and eight or nine qian until 11:30. At that time, there was a pullback of one tael. At 11:45, HSBC suddenly listed and further reduced, with British gold at 125, US dollars at 25, and Japanese gold adding one fen, suddenly raising to 79 taels and five or six qian. Then, Citibank and others sold British gold for January at 171875, and then there was a back and forth fluctuation of one tael. At noon closing, it was 79 taels and 9 qian, and it had already boomed to 82 taels. Taikang Run, Yuan Heng, and others bought it, but it was heavily suppressed to more than one tael. The initial listed price was 623 taels and 4 qian, down 47.48 taels. Then, it was increased by one fen and changed to 628 taels and 2 qian, down 48.49 taels.</p>
<p>The exchange market became tighter, and the market became even higher. The opening price for the afternoon market was 82 taels and 3 qian, an increase of more than two taels. The noon closing had already been high. Then, it rose to three taels and two qian. Yong Feng, Tai Heng, Yuan Wan Xing Shun, and others had already sold, and British gold turned flat. Initially, Huabi offered 17125 for January, then the banks counter-traded 171875 for December and 17125 for October, so it fell back by three taels and zero. There was one tael and zero hidden in between. At around 2 o'clock, it was 80 taels. Afterwards, large households took the opportunity to enter, especially British gold. Huabi quickly offered one tael, two qian, and eight and a half fen of Japanese gold for November. Then, Mai Jia Li offered British gold for January at 171875, and Huabi Dongya offered 17125 for December. Fellow traders continued to cooperate diligently, and the Bank of Communications absorbed cash again, with a price of 85 taels. Fuchang still exchanged it. Yuan Cheng, Yong Zhi, Feng Tai, Yuan Heng, and others on the table bravely bought in, and the market situation reached its peak, with the feeling of soaring by four or five taels. At more than 20 minutes past 4 o'clock, it reached 85 taels and 2 qian. However, from 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock, there was a difference of more than one tael. In short, people's minds were extremely good, and the short sellers urgently covered their positions. However, such a high peak in one day was unexpected. The closing price at 4:30 was 585 taels, which was a huge increase of 12 taels and 8 qian compared to the previous day. Finally, it was re-traded to more than four taels. Checking the daily range, the highest was 85 taels and 2 qian, the lowest was 74 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 10 taels and 0.7 qian. The listed price was suppressed by 43 taels, and the ledger recorded 92 taels for October, 89 taels for November, and 80 taels for December. The water replenishment was 92 taels, and 98 taels in the afternoon. The spot goods opened at 74 taels and 6 qian in the morning, closed at 81 taels in the morning, and 1 tael and 2 qian in the afternoon, closing at 4 taels and 3 qian.</p>
<p>The transaction was heated, and the demand side was grand and powerful. The transactions of various firms were very firm. Yuan Cheng, Tai Kang Run, Tai Xing, Dade Cheng, Cheng Feng, Yong Yi, Feng Yong Xie, Yu Tai Heng Yuan all bought in, while Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yong Feng, Yuan Mao, Yong Heng Xing, and others sold out. Zhi Feng, Yong Fu, Chang Yuan Heng sold out and then bought in. In the afternoon, Tai Kang Run, Yuan Heng, Fu Chang, Yuan Cheng, Yong Yuan Xing Yong, and others all bought in, while Shun Li, Wan Xing, Xie Yu, Yong Feng, Xin Heng, and others sold out. Zhi Feng Yong Dade Cheng Yuan Mao Yong had many ins and outs. There were also many ups and downs in various firms. Hedgers sold some, so they grabbed bills of exchange. The Dalian gang supplied more than 3,000 bills, while they bought in 1,000 bills. The Guangdong gang did not have large bill transactions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange, Both Official and Unofficial, is Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market showed a slight decline, and British and American exchange rates also fell, while Japanese and American exchange rates rose. HSBC listed prices, and since the morning it had reduced by half a point, with British gold at 1225, US exchange at 25, Indian exchange at 75, French exchange at 7 yuan, Dutch ocean at half a yuan, German exchange at 1 mark, and slope exchange adding 75, Hong Kong adding 25, and Japanese gold adding one fen. At 11:45, it suddenly changed and reduced by half a point, with British gold at 125, currently listed at one shilling, six pence, and 875, US dollars reduced by 25, totaling 38 yuan and 25, Indian exchange at 75, totaling 105 rupees and 75, French exchange at 6 yuan, totaling 974 yuan, German exchange at 1 yuan, totaling 160 marks, Five Harmony Exchange at 75, totaling 94 taels and 75, slope exchange adding another tael, totaling 147 taels and 75, Japanese gold adding one fen, totaling one tael, three qian, and 025, Hong Kong still at 82 taels and 25. As for the internal banks, British, American, and Japanese exchanges were also very tight. The initial opening was good, and later the gold price was even higher and more profitable. In the afternoon, it became even more expensive, and the gold price had already broken through 85 taels. The short sellers were greatly suppressed and had to cover their positions. People's minds were agitated and extremely brisk. As a result, compared with the previous day, British gold was reduced by 25, US dollars reduced by half a yuan, and Japanese gold rose by more than 2 fen. Chinese businessmen, speculators, and gold industry Fuchang, Yufeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, and the Dalian gang all climbed and cooperated, so transactions were unusually heated. British gold was estimated to have settled more than 560,000. The banks were still active in selling, with Sanbing, Taiwan Sumitomo, Shanghai Dongya, Mai Jia Li, Huayi, Citibank, Huabi, and others selling their positions. However, Taiwan Sansheng also absorbed 10,000 pounds each. Banks mutually traded 100,000 pounds and US$200,000. Chinese businessmen had ins and outs of about 120,000 yuan. Japanese gold was clawed in by the Dalian gang for more than 2 million yuan. Sanbing, Huabi, and North Korea sold it. However, it was heard that the British gold and other currencies clawed in by the firms were only used to cover a small number of notes, so the gold market felt even better.</p>
<h3>Silver Price Recedes, Exchange Rate Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, the large silver bar suddenly expanded and contracted, making it difficult for people to grasp, and the trend turned downwards again. Local Chinese merchants came out and speculators bought in at small prices. The market was still flat. After closing, the United States slightly offered, and both near and far term shrank by 125, both being 16 pence and a half (equivalent to one shilling and seven pence and a half of British gold). The New York telegram also stated that the US silver price had also shrunk by 125, with the spot price being 35.75 cents. The British to US dollar fell by 09375, being 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 96875. The US to British dollar fell by 125, being 4 yuan, entering jiao, 5 fen, 9375. The US to Japanese yen rose by 0625, being 49 yuan and 75. The British to Japanese yen was still 2 shillings and 5625. The Shanghai Shilling was shortened by 125, totaling one shilling, seven pence and 625. Bombay spot price fell slightly by 6 anna, totaling 47 rupees and 06 anna. Also at 10:40 in the morning, the Reuters telegram arrived and continued to see an upward trend, with the Japanese to US dollar rising another 0625, totaling 49 yuan and 6875, and the British to Japanese yen adding 03125, totaling 2 shillings and 053125. Also at 10:20, the Telecom Agency came and the near term also continued to see an increase, with both the Japanese to US dollar's offering price and price high by 0625, totaling 49 yuan, 75 to 825. The British offering and acceptance price was largely at 03125, totaling 2 shillings and 05625 to 59375. The long term still had no glory or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Lending Market is Weak and Sluggish</h3>
<p>Overview of the Market: The financial industry's market sentiment has been consistently following the trend for every third and ninth month (that is, the 40th day of the lunar calendar). Due to the return of a large number of maturing loans, the procedures for silver loans must be more extensive and the demand is high. In addition, the farmers harvest cotton and new grains are brought to the threshing floor, and the demand for foreign funds must be smooth. In theory, the situation must be very busy, but the current situation is very different from the past. The market transaction is unexpectedly quiet, which is really hard to predict.</p>
<p>Daily Interest Rates (Foreign Interest): Because transactions were sparse in the morning and afternoon markets, and there was no competition, the result was the same at 7 qian, 2 fen, 5 li and a half, which was slightly less than the morning and afternoon markets of the previous day by 1 hao, 2 hu and a half. The market sentiment was unusually idle. (Silver Interest): The morning market was 1 qian, which seemed better than the previous morning by 6 fen, but the afternoon market suddenly fell by 4 fen, totaling 6 fen. There was still no premium for the silver head, but the bank's listing price was 4 fen.</p>
<p>Conditions of Subsidiary Currencies: There were few transactions in Jiangnan small silver dollars, and the market price was casual. Yesterday, it was slightly better than the previous day by half a li, totaling 6 qian, 4 fen and 4 li. The morning and afternoon were made in the same style. Transactions were only 2,500 jiao in the morning market and no market in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were 6 qian, 3 fen, 5 li and 2 hao and a half in the morning market and 6 qian, 3 fen, 4 li and 7 hao and a half in the afternoon market, which was also less than the previous day by 7 hao and a half. Transactions were 135,000 jiao in the morning market and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were also shorter by 1,000 wen, totaling 388,500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Loans): The bank's acceptance and delivery seemed slightly busier than the previous few days. Chinese merchants accepted and delivered bill loans of 2.56 million, and foreign merchants accepted and delivered bill loans of 1.89 million. Special loans had inflows and outflows of 23 million, maturing loans of 34 million, and various exchange rates, cargo taxes and miscellaneous loans accepted and delivered 8.67 million, and 1.3 million out of the warehouse. Japanese banks accepted and delivered various loans of more than 3.5 million and 400,000 out of the warehouse. Qianzhuang Yingo public orders accepted and delivered more than 39 million, and silver head loans accepted and delivered more than 4.1 million. Various exchange loans were more than 1.1 million, and cash accepted was 1.78 million. (Foreign Loans): Exchange bill loans were made 1.343 million in the morning market, and there were no transactions in the morning market of banknotes. In the afternoon market, exchange bill loans were 545,000 and banknotes were 15,000. The off-market banknote transaction was 172,000 in the morning market and 95,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions were 500,000 for inter-market trading in the morning market and 550,000 for inter-market trading in the afternoon market. Various banks' foreign accounts received and delivered more than 1.3 million, and banknote inflow and outflow was 2.34 million. Qianzhuang public foreign orders accepted and delivered more than 4.4 million, and foreign silver head loans accepted and delivered more than 1.78 million. Borrowing foreign loans had inflow and outflow of more than 700,000. Small peer trades made exchange head banknote transactions of 780,000, and the source of passenger traffic was more than 600,000, and the loss was only more than 300,000 in the mainland.</p>
<h3>Security and Bond Prices Both Trend Weak</h3>
<p>Only the Seventh Year slightly rose, and the Post-War 19 was quiet and stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current market transaction of public debt was very clear, only two thousand yuan of seven long and six kinds were offered in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. The futures totaled more than 8 million yuan for the whole day. Although the trend of various bond prices was still calm, the market sentiment was still weak, so the sellers' popularity was more active than buying in, and the bond price trended downwards. However, the result was that the prices of legacy reduction, demobilization, customs revenue, and the Post-War 19 customs revenue 96, etc., fell by about 67 jiao compared to the previous day. Only the price of the Post-War 19 volume was stable, and the Seven Longs rose slightly.</p>

<p>Six Long Present 66.50 Rise 0.50 1,000</p>
<p>Six Long Noon 66.30 66.10 Fall 0.55 230,000</p>

<p>Nineteen Customs Eleven 67.50 66.70 Fall 0.90 1,830,000</p>
<h3>Yarn, Flower, and Yarn Market Trends are Very Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market trend is very weak, and the downward wind has risen again. In reality, the overall situation is not good, and the current demand is cold, and each gang has no business to do, so people's hearts are not strong, and a part of the bulls endure the pain to settle, and the market is becoming more and more tired. The sellers are well prepared to deliver goods this month, and the market atmosphere is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>The Multi-Party Settlement of the Human Standard: The opening of the human standard in the front market was tired because a certain manufacturer was willing to sell and settle, and the market atmosphere was tired. The more the second and third plates fell, the more panic people became, and each month fell 8 qian to 1 tael and 3 qian. In the afternoon, some profit-takers clawed in the air, and the opening fell 2 and 3 plates and rose back. As a result, each month was flat. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 28,350 packages.

<h3>The Cotton Market Shows a Relaxed Trend</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and tired, but the foreign cotton market situation is still flat and stable, but there is also a lack of upward momentum. The local spot cotton and printed cotton of each factory have been absorbed and are not purchased. In addition, the downward wind of the yarn market is more and more prosperous, and the demand for local cotton is becoming more and more silent. However, the multi-party side is fiercely purchasing and increasing codes due to the price reduction of the standard fire machine. In short, the actual transaction is absolutely prohibited, and there is still little upward momentum in the future.</p>
<p>There are few buyers of Han Standard: The opening of the Han Standard front market was flat and light, and there were not many buyers, and each fell 1 qian and 2 plates. The result was that the yarn market fell again and the results fell 12 qian. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was flat and stable, and each month had no rise or fall. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 41,200 dan. It was found that Hengyi sold 3,400 dan, Yuchang 3,200 dan, Yiyu 2,700 dan, Rongxing 2,800 dan, and the rest 1,5600 dan. Shenchang bought 3,300 dan, Gongtai 5,100 dan, and the rest 1,2300 dan. Now the closing price is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3>The US Cotton and Sanpin are Stable.</h3>
<p>US cotton peers are clawing in: Yesterday, US cotton was initially tired due to favorable weather forecasts, but later became firm due to peers and reactionary buying.

<h3>Grain and River Lower Rice Market Step is Firm</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, Tiangong was still cloudy, and the source from the mainland was not much. More than 20 stores on this street sold smoothly. The new Japonica was still good in the early morning transaction. However, the buyers' appetite was not good due to the price increase of 2 jiao. Although the situation was firm, the market trended towards stagnation. The specially topped Japonica勉 opened 15 yuan. The thin Japonica situation on the left side of the customs was stable. The high-quality 14 yuan and 23 jiao and the sheep Japonica top were refreshing. The buyers continued to sell, and the general market saw a tight angle and a half high. The Duo Jian opened 12 yuan and the top was delivered in carts. The source of the top was also rare. People's hearts were firm due to the rain, so the sales of each grade of civilians were very active, and the market price rose by 2 jiao. The special high-grade port Xian opened 11 yuan and 3 jiao, changing to yuan yin hua, and the market transaction was quite smooth. The hanging rice was very popular, but the market surface did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, the river arrived successively, with an estimated 20 stores. The market went to hua 활 　常帮. The new Japonica saw a tightening of 2 or 3 jiao. The high-quality goods opened at 14 yuan and 67 jiao. The Su Tong white Japonica customer sales were slightly good, and the price also rose by 1 jiao. The thin Japonica, such as Nanbang Sijing, Songjiang, and Liantang, was temporarily interested in Ningbang's movement and sales, so it was better than in the past. The general market only rose by a corner and a half due to the connection of the source. The special top Japonica opened at 13 yuan. The sheep Duo Jian trended towards stagnation and dimness, and the sales were not very smooth. The top grade opened at 11 yuan and the middle grade followed the general trend and rose by nearly a jiao, changing to yin yuan. The same-grade style remained flat.</p>
<h3>Label Powder Gradually Soaring</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month rose gradually. The reason for this rise after the fall is due to the fact that the special high wheat was unable to follow the small fall in the price of standard wheat, and the factories would have to lose about 1 qian per bag if they continued to produce as usual. Therefore, they had no choice but to stop production. Therefore, the fall wind came from the ordering of foreign wheat, and the reason for the rise was that the shutdown of production would cause a delay. Therefore, due to the natural reason, most people's hearts were not active, and the buying atmosphere was smooth. The long-term period was also expensive due to the inability of foreign wheat to arrive immediately. It was still better to have more face like the actual sales of one 활. As a result, this month rose 3 points compared to the previous day, November rose 2 and a half points, December rose 3 points, January rose 2 points and 7 li and a half, February rose 2 points and 2 li and a half, and March rose 2 and a half points.</p>
<h3>Far-term Wheat Gradually Soaring</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the day-term wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month rose sharply, especially for the far-term period. Because the difference between November and the following and the current month was nearly 2 qian a few days ago, the original intention was to prepare foreign wheat, but all the factories that ordered were after December. As a result, the standard for each month must be turned upward, so the buying atmosphere in the far-term period was heated, and the market also rose sharply. As a result, this month rose 4 points compared to the previous day, the eleven and twelve months rose by a huge amount of 1 qian and 1 fen, and January February rose by 1 qian, and 3 points of July, and March rose 9 points. The high-quality goods in the current wheat market are still popular, such as the white wheat from Shandong Qingjiangpu, which has opened to 4 taels and 7 qian. The middle and secondary grades are still flat, and more than 1,000 bags of high and secondary wheat opened by Tongshi have been processed by Fufeng and others.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Market Shape Benefits from</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no foreign rice market because the stocks had been allocated to the Ke market, and there were no floating stocks on the market. The returning goods had no transactions because the price increase for entering households was too tight. There were only a few scattered Ke Xian arrivals, and the consumption was not only in this street but also in the north and south gangs, so the market was even tighter. Nanjing coarse rice also opened to 7 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao, with 300 bags estimated to have been opened. Each rice from Jiangxi saw a rising trend, with 1,300 bags estimated to have been traded in the morning at prices of 9 yuan and 9 jiao to 10 yuan and a half. 125 bags were late at 12 yuan and 1 jiao, and 150 bags were second at 12 yuan and a half to 11 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>

<h3>Seafood, Dried Jellyfish Skin Stable, Fish Glue Market Rises</h3>
<p>Dried jellyfish: Reports indicate that the harvests in various regions for both the spring and summer seasons of this year (Gengshen) were poor. Shipments from areas like Yangshan and Huanglong decreased by half compared to the previous year. Only Daishan and Si Jiao had slightly better yields, but even those were scattered. As a result, inventories in the market are low. Prices have remained stable for a long time and continue to rise slightly. High-grade old jellyfish skin sells for 9.7 taels per picul, high-grade new skin for 9.2 taels, ordinary skin for 8.7 or 8.8 taels, mixed-sand inferior jellyfish skin for 8.2 or 8.3 taels, old jellyfish head for 8.5 taels, and new jellyfish head for 7 taels. Recently, demand from various Yangtze River merchant groups has been strong, further depleting inventories and boosting the market.</p>
<p>Fish Glue: Foreign firms and Chinese merchants have been actively purchasing fish glue in recent days, leading to a gradual increase in asking prices. Yesterday, high-quality dried glue was priced at 95 taels per picul, bleached glue at 92 taels, and local glue at 88 taels, each increasing by 5 taels compared to the previous market price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Silk Factories Reducing Production and Price Soars</h3>
<p>Silk factories have reduced production due to shutdowns, resulting in low inventories and a price increase of two to three taels. Silk factories in various regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have announced shutdowns due to significant losses. The production of long silk from silk factories has decreased daily, while demand from French firms remains high, causing market prices to soar. Yesterday, 20 bales of superior long silk from Xinfu were priced at 158 taels, an increase of two to three taels.</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk Spot Prices Show Weakness</h3>
<p>While sales of artificial silk have been active recently, spot prices have actually weakened, with average prices for each brand decreasing by about two taels per hundred pounds. This is attributed to factories gradually reducing their intake, as autumn silk fabrics and Ge cloths have already been woven, and winter demand is not high. This has led to a sharp decrease in market sales and asking prices. Recent statistics from the Artificial Silk Association show that daily shipments have been less than 300 cases (compared to an average of 2,600 to 2,700 cases per week in the previous month), excluding Sundays when the market is closed, indicating a decrease of more than 30%. Yesterday, De Ji sold at 120 taels, Tian You Empress at 144 taels, and Hao Shi Rui Kang No. 150 goods were reduced to 119.5 taels. Lu Lin and Jin Qilin were sold at 128.5 taels, and Kai Li Pai Da Wu at 121.75 taels.</p>
<h3>Native Tea Merchants and Moroccan Tea Trade Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still no large-scale transactions of red and green boxed tea from various sources. Asking prices for Zhen Mei and Pearl tea from various tea merchants tended to fall. The local Zhen Mei tea market has been sluggish for a long time. Yesterday, Tongfu Foreign Firm received an order from Morocco and resumed operations, but the offer price of over 30 taels was four or five taels lower than before. Currently, there are still more than 10,000 boxes of red and green tea in stock, which may be difficult to clear within the year.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Prices Increase Sharply</h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market continues to rise. Yesterday, straight tribute wool increased by another 0.5%, with Yan Kai at 3.35 taels and Moganshan at 3.3 taels. Changbanqiao Yipin Fugui is consistently out of stock. Judging from the situation, there may be more shortages in the future. Sales to Qingdao and Sichuan are quite active, but the local market is relatively stagnant due to the rapid price increases. Fine broadcloth is increasingly scarce, with holders of spot goods hoarding them. Yesterday, crepe also increased accordingly, with the Movement Association requiring 2.925 taels and Kaiyuan Palace, Tiger Beauty, and Yun Tongzi consistently selling for 2.6 taels. Among all goods, only printed cloth is sluggish, selling for 2.05 taels yesterday, a decrease of two to three fen from the highest price at the beginning of the month. The huge fluctuations in prices are causing anxiety among merchants placing orders. Yuehua velvet, medium-sized pattern, is in short supply, selling for 2.125 taels yesterday, while medium-sized patterns remain at 2.05 to 2.5 taels. Black floral cloth shipped to Wakayama in 25 pieces opened at 2.025 taels. Western goods such as Yu Yu silk and Thai Western satin are also in short supply, but actual sales are limited due to the high prices.</p>
<h3>Yuan Fang's Cloth Sales Moderate, Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the date for Yuan Fang Foreign Firm's auction of cloth, with a total of 171 items, amounting to 6,440 bolts, all sold at unrestricted prices. This was only two items (64 bolts) less than the previous week. Among various merchants, only Tianjin made some purchases, while the Yangtze River area also showed limited demand. Fellow merchants made some slight bids, but prices did not improve. For example, Thai Western satin fluctuated between 0.25 and 0.75 fen per chi, Yuan velvet, such as Jiu Fang plus 1.75 fen, Jiu Liang Qi plus 4.75 fen, and Wu Hua Dong increased by as much as 0.8 fen due to active bidding. Yu Yu silk fell by 0.05 to 0.41 tael per bolt, while some rose by 0.05 to over 0.1 tael. Blue cloth without a pass decreased slightly by 0.25 to 0.34 tael, and bleached cloth also decreased by over 0.1 tael, also without a pass. Yanghong cloth, such as six-pound Fo Shou, rose by 0.2 tael, five-pound plus 0.15 tael, bleached fine cloth rose by over 0.2 tael, and bleached cloth fell by 0.45 to 0.34 tael, with some increasing by over 0.1 tael. Only merchants plus 0.26 tael, Hua San Qian plus 0.3 tael, blue Shuanglu light rose by 0.15 tael, and Yangfang brand plus 0.16 tael. The auctioned goods included 15 cases of Thai Western satin (430 bolts), 12 cases of Yuan velvet (240 bolts), 97 cases of Yu Yu silk (3,530 bolts), 2 cases of Yuan color cloth (80 bolts), 9 cases of blue cloth (330 bolts), 8 cases of bleached cloth (400 bolts), 3 cases of Yanghong cloth (180 bolts), 3 cases of bleached fine cloth (150 bolts), and 22 cases of bleached cloth (1,100 bolts).</p>
<h3>Metal Hardware, Black Iron Sheet Prices Rise Another Five Cents</h3>
<p>Eighteen-gauge, two-foot-six-inch black iron sheets have been very scarce in the market recently. This is because no one is placing orders after the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates. As a result, imports are very limited. However, buyers are exceptionally enthusiastic, leading to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The standard price has been rising steadily, currently reaching 11.5 taels per bundle, an increase of 0.05 tael from before. It is reported that merchants from Dalian, Tianjin, and Niuzhuang are vying to purchase, making the market very strong.</p>

<h3>A Page from the Life of Thomas Mann, Recent German Literary Figure</h3>
<p>By Mann Ru</p>
<p>The renowned Berlin bookstore Fischer has announced the publication of an intriguing new book this autumn and has already published a portion of the book as a sample in the June issue of its magazine, Nesse Rundschau. This excerpt itself is a complete masterpiece: thirty-two pages from the memoirs of the German Nobel laureate Thomas Mann. The Fischer bookstore announced that this self-portrait by Mann will be published in the autumn.</p>
<p>Indeed, Thomas Mann's memoirs promise to be fascinating. Mann's works are always exceptionally discreet, never revealing the author's true self. Consequently, it's challenging to discern the author's persona from his writings. If we wish to know Mann himself, his memoirs would naturally be the sole source of information. In his memoirs, Thomas Mann, for the first time, openly exposes the depths of his heart and emotions. He recounts his joys and sorrows in a concise manner. His narrative is composed, yet this apparent serenity deeply moves us. We are astonished to discover how many intimate experiences are concealed beneath the objective, formal, and unlyrical narratives of his novels and short stories. Behind the cold mask lies a series of cherished family moments. His most recent work, "Mario and the Magician," portrays family life with complete objectivity, allowing the reader to forget the author entirely. However, the author's own family life subtly underlies the narrative.</p>
<p>Yet, the most captivating aspect of this glimpse into Thomas Mann's life is not the external events he recounts, but rather his accounts of the creative process and how ideas take shape in his writing. He reveals that when embarking on a new work, he invariably tells himself that this time it will be an insignificant piece, easy and quick to complete. He repeatedly tells himself this to summon his courage. He approached "The Magic Mountain" in this way, yet it took him ten years to finish. During those ten years, the personal sorrows and emotional struggles he endured permeated the novel through his utterly objective prose. Even the humor that lightens the tone in some parts of the book carries the breath of death that haunted the world during those ten years.</p>
<p>This is roughly what we know about the forthcoming memoir. Additionally, Thomas Mann informs us that he is currently working on another book that takes him into new territory. He is writing a large-scale mythical novel titled "Joseph and His Brothers." For this work, Mann traveled to Palestine and Egypt to conduct fieldwork, enabling him to vividly depict the fate of the Israelite people. It seems that even this introspective author has succumbed to the irresistible urge to explore exotic locales.</p>
<p>Besides Thomas Mann, two other prominent German writers, residing in different cities, have simultaneously published works on similar themes. They are Josef Ponten from Munich and Hans Friedrich Blunck from Hamburg. Ponten is writing a series of novels under the general title "Volk auf dem Wege. Roman der deutschen Unruhe" (People on the Way. A Novel of German Unrest). The first volume, titled "Volga Volga," which stands alone, has already been published. The timing of this book's publication is particularly apt, as Germany currently expresses solidarity with Germans in the Volga region. The book is indeed powerfully written, often reaching the heights of epic grandeur and filled with colorful adventures. It tells the story of German farmers who immigrated to Russia during the reign of Empress Catherine and how one of these Germans, upon returning to modern Germany, experiences profound disappointment because the spirit and ideals of the Germanic people are expressed with such intensity. This novel has been described by some as the German "Iliad" and "Odyssey," a comparison that is certainly exaggerated. However, there is no doubt that Ponten's work will become a major modern masterpiece in German literature.</p>
<p>While Josef Ponten in Southern Germany is writing about the history of Northern Germans, Hans Friedrich Blunck in Northern Germany is writing about the history of Germans who have emigrated to Central America. Blunck's recently published novel titled "Land der Vulkane" (Land of Volcanoes) focuses on the lives of Germans living in tropical Central America. His work is grand in scale, almost a lifetime endeavor. He writes about the growth and rise of the Germanic people from the mythical era when gods still ruled the world, covering everything in between. The breadth of the subject matter and complexity of the structure is immense. It is truly remarkable that Blunck is able to maintain such beauty and consistency throughout this difficult work. His most recent installment describes the struggles and challenges of modern Germans. In this volume, the German colonists have become wealthy plantation owners who regard this new land as their own. One of these plantation owners has a son, a new man who breaks away from his comfortable family and becomes embroiled in the political conflicts of the locals. He later declares that he will renounce the farm he is supposed to inherit and start a new life for himself. Only one courageous German girl accompanies him. They go together to a desolate desert of volcanic rock, which is still exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Both Ponten and Blunck write about German women in their works, but their views on women are clearly different, so the women they portray are also different types. In ancient times, it was enough for a wife to stay at home and let her husband go out into the world. Ponten believes that women should be like this, so he shows us the old type of German woman.</p>
<p>But Blunck writes about the new type. He writes about modern German girls and tells us how eager they are to share their husbands' unstable lives and to happily participate in the hard work of building a new family.</p>

<p>Changming Film Company announces that the first and second episodes of "Burning Pingyang City," which the company spent a great deal of money and manpower to produce, have been shown to the public and have received unanimous praise. Today, the first three episodes will be combined and rescreened at the New Central Theater. The three episodes are full of highlights, and the photographic techniques alone are enough to amaze the Chinese people. Such as the magical powers of the omnipotent sweep, turning mountains into seas. The sizes of human beings are very different, with the large ones like giant Buddhas and the small ones like millet grains living together in one room, creating a strange and interesting atmosphere. There is also the scene of flying horses soaring into the sky. This scene is as magical as the Moon Palace Treasure Box, creating a mystical mirror effect that makes viewers feel as if they are in a fairyland, feeling unparalleled relaxation in their spirits. Regarding the fragrant and romantic scenes, there is the aquatic flirting in the water and the garden tour on a moonlit night, which are extremely delicate and warm. Such a good film deserves to be full, and those who want good seats should come early.</p>
<p>World Grand Theater at the corner of Xibao Xing Road and Qingyun Road in Zhabei announces that it will be screening the adventure, fragrant, and interesting film "The Adventures of the Lantern" starting today (24th). This film opens up a new path for domestic films and is comparable to "Moon Palace Treasure Box." The costumes, scenery, plot, etc. are all non-Chinese and do not fall into the usual patterns, so it has a special flavor. The giant eels, pythons, white bears, monkeys, and strange beauties are especially enough to surprise and delight audiences a hundredfold. In addition to screening the film, the theater will also screen the latest masterpiece of the comedian Rube Lynn, "Spinning Palace Romance," as a special treat for the audience.</p>
<p>Minxin Film Company announces that the China Eastern Travel Group, organized by the Hong Kong YMCA to tour famous scenic spots in East China, consists of 57 gentlemen and merchants led by Mr. Li Shaobai and Mr. Cao Yanshen. They arrived in Shanghai on the 6th of this month, and the next day they went to the capital to pay respects to the mausoleum of Sun Yat-sen and to visit Yanziji National Government, etc. They then traveled to Qiantang to watch the tide and visit the scenic West Lake, followed by a tour of Huqiu. After returning to Shanghai, they visited the Commercial Press and major factories, as well as the company. On the same day, the filming of the drama "Love and Duty" took place. They expressed their admiration for the performance of the actors and the company's equipment. The next night, at the invitation of Mr. He Tingran, the manager of Nanjing Grand Theater, they visited the theater. They praised the theater's beautiful layout and the clarity of the projector's sound as the best in the country. On the morning of the 21st, they boarded the Canadian Empress and returned to Hong Kong. More than 100 Shanghai gentlemen and merchants saw them off. When they said goodbye on the ship, they deeply lamented that the development of industry and commerce in Shanghai was inferior to that of Hong Kong, and that they especially regretted that they could not tour around completely. It is reported that the group spent more than 100,000 yuan on local products, etc. from various places, including more than 300 yuan on Yuhuatai pebbles alone. Other expenses can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Journey</h3>
<p>By Su Ling</p>
<p>(16) Living in the Theater</p>
<p>Waking up from a dream and stretching, I really wanted to sleep a little longer.</p>
<p>"Old Wang, get up, look what time it is!"</p>
<p>"Hmm, who cares what time it is? I'll get up when the head cook calls us for lunch." Fat Old Wang really didn't want to get up, but the head cook was already calling outside the door.</p>
<p>"It's past twelve o'clock, let's eat, get up and eat!"</p>
<p>So I climbed out of bed, looking for water to wash my face and rinse my mouth. Old Wang also rubbed his eyes and sat up. Because it was time to eat, otherwise he would never have gotten up.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I moved into the New Theatre, and the lifestyle changed greatly. Almost the entire time for life activities had to be spent at night, while the daytime was spent sleeping.</p>
<p>After waiting for the head cook to urge us to eat outside the door, I and all the residents of this theater (besides the staff, there were also a few Korean families living here. Because the academy started summer vacation early, I was free. Because Mr. Xie, the manager of the New Theatre, agreed to let me move in here, I lazily crawled out of bed. By that time, the sun had already passed midday.</p>
<p>This theater rarely has the opportunity to show good films besides showing some low-grade domestic films. So, although I can freely watch movies every night, I don't know what films the theater is showing every day. Sometimes, when a better film comes, Old Xie will tell me, and I will go into the audience to take a look.</p>
<p>It seems that it has become a compulsory course every night. With Yajiusha or Old Xie when he's free, we walk along a quieter street to Central Avenue. After taking a stroll or two on Central Avenue, we find a resting chair under the Jinshan Hotel to sit down because we can hear the music from above. That way, we can't help but take a look at the Eastern-flavored blue-eyed waitresses when we come back. Sometimes we don't have money, but we still have to sit on the resting chair at the door once.</p>
<p>After this essential nightly patrol, they go to play cards, and I want to read a little book or perhaps write a manuscript in a corner of the room. The sound of inferior techniques and the clatter of gambling faintly came from the theater.</p>
<p>Probably, the theater will not end until after twelve o'clock every night. At this time, we will stand at the door to see the audience leaving the theater after the show. Then the lights at the door will go out, and we have to prepare to eat supper.</p>
<p>Naturally, we can't just sleep after eating. Sometimes I also join the card game in the next room.</p>
<p>Old Xie downstairs is singing Peking opera. Sometimes, probably before changing to a new film, they are very busy, stopping the card game and having to do a lot of advertising. Old Wang is the director of the advertising department, and he is so busy that he is panting.</p>
<p>Inevitably, everyone feels that it is time to sleep when the eastern sky has gradually turned white. Old Wang especially wants to open the curtains to take a look. He shouts,</p>
<p>"It's dawn, let's sleep!" These words seem to contradict human life, right?</p>
<h3>Law School Variety Show (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>The variety show held the night before last was, as usual, for this purpose. It was originally planned to be held the day after Double Ten Day, but because that day was the anniversary of the Premier's assassination, it was changed to the night before last. Precisely because there was more time to prepare, this time it felt even more brilliant than in the past. Regarding news of the show's preparatory committee, we saw the minutes of several meetings at the announcement board. The pre-announced program, in addition to the performances of our own school's students, what was most welcome was Su Shaoqing's Ping Opera, the Magic Society's magic, the Sisters' Dance Troupe, and the various songs and dances of the Peach Blossom Dance Society, as well as the various performances of the China Women's Physical Education College and the Municipal Haishan Primary School, and the slapstick comedy of the two masters of the Law and Politics College, Fan Wenlong and Qiu Huide. All the students could only eagerly look forward to the arrival of the event.</p>
<p>That night was so lively. The entire third floor of the new school building was used as reception rooms, dressing rooms, and refreshment rooms. For a time, the voices of the crowd were boiling, and Chairman Wu Shaoyu, Front Desk Director Yin Kui, Backstage Director Xu Daizhi, General Manager Feng Xiancheng, and the gatekeepers Wang Lisheng and Huang Juying were all very busy. At the same time, Mr. Huang was also specially responsible for cheering, shouting in a strange and affected manner from time to time ("Good, one more time!"). It must have been very tiring. Also, Miss Han Jinxia and others who were invited as greeters were also busy, very much like being on the Shanyin Road, unable to attend to everyone.</p>
<p>There were more than twenty programs, lasting for six hours. The first to open the show was our slapstick master, Fan Wenlong, with his so-called stand-up comedy. Mr. Fan's slapstick skills have long been renowned in Shanghai and need no further description. The Dragon and Tiger Fight of the China Women's Physical Education College was exceptionally brilliant. For students in school to perform with such achievement is truly commendable. The "Rose Sisters" of Haishan Primary School were lovable, especially the four- or five-year-old boy, who was innocent and lively and most amusing. That kind of performance together by young boys and girls, free from suspicion, only made one regret that childhood is gone. Su Shaoqing's Ping Opera needs no further comment. Seeing that the program at the time was overcrowded, he refused to sing a second act, which was truly a pity. The magic performed by the Academy of Fine Arts lasted the longest. Ms. Tang's Ping Opera and Ms. Zheng's songs also won applause and cheers. The Sisters' Dance Troupe and the Peach Blossom Dance Society were even more outstanding and unparalleled. Their performance was not comparable to school performances, but truly had considerable training and was a kind of professional skill. The audience did not hesitate to tear their throats and clap their hands until they were sore, shouting wildly and applauding. It can be seen how popular they were on the spot. Here, we must especially introduce the Shanghai Magic Research Society. It is truly commendable that this newly established group has achieved such results. Precisely this point cannot but make one amazed. History and achievement have succeeded in the reverse ratio of what is called ("Magic is something everyone can do, but each has different skills"). When performing all kinds of most brilliant, that is, the most unexpected places, the audience, because most are mischievous young students, often try to "make trouble," that is, to expose its trick, but the results are all in vain. The magic of its transformation is truly worthy of its name.</p>
<p>There were other programs, but due to limitations of space, we could not introduce them one by one and can only bring it to a temporary close. (Guangmei)</p>
