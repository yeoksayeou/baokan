<p>法意交爭乃歐州今後之危機意爲大戰後新興之國鋭意振作不肯讓人法爲大戰後歐洲主盟之國力爭先着如何甘居人下此其二國所以交爭之大原因此外或因歷史之關係或以地壤相接之關係足以成爭端而日益加甚者不可勝數至於報紙之互攻有责任人之互詆猶其餘事也法之邊界已在鞏固防禦工事兩國海軍之談判已經擱淺其他在各小國間合縱連横之政策各已開始今後歐洲相峙之敵體舍法意而誰</p>
<p>國際間法意之交爭與殖民地與宗國間英印之互門均爲一時問不能消弭之局勢蓋因兩方皆具决心皆求目的之必逹而又無一方可以退讓故無論所用之手段或强或弱或緩或烈而爲有心而成决非無意偶然之事則人盡而知也依物理而言今日種因旣深日後之成果必大斯乃無可避免者</p>

<p>對華航業積極進行</p>
<p>上海船禁票度飛漲</p>
<p>本埠日商大連汽船會社因滿鐵施行新政策而有收歸管理之舉一時社會上竟有傳其解散者殊不知日人對華航業素抱得寸進尺之主張而該社又當業務起色之際寗肯放棄在華航權耶兹將所聞之切實狀况再分誌如下</p>
<p>改變名義大連汽社本滿鐵之資本創辦現在已有安東營口天津及上海大連大連日本等五條航路全部船舶逹三十餘艘上海一路最爲發逹今次滿鐵收歸鐵道部管轄其辦法則將大連之總社取消改入船舶部而外埠去店仍照常</p>
<p>營業毫無變動不過名稱上改易昨聞該社得到滿鐵來訊或將改稱滿鐵船舶部上海支店同時亦擬將大連汽社四字仍保留而附加入行名之上使旅客貨主不致誤會巳在討論中</p>
<p>香港設社在此改易管理問题之際而在航業上仍取積進熊度因其新造之各輪在九月以前可全部落成所計擬創開之南華航路亦將在九月前開行故近日正在籌設香港支店以管理中國南海各口之船期貨客等事支店長巳經派出不日可以由連來滬轉往香港矣</p>
<p>船票再漲該社上海赴青島大連船票價巳經漲過一次昨日又得大連總社來電謂金價日增不已所有各等艙位着于七月一日起再漲二成兹將新價再調查報告如下上海往大連頭等室原定六十元後漲至七十二元七一起增至九十元又三等室原定十五元後漲至十八元七一起增至卄二元上海往青島頭等室原定四十二元漲至五十元七一起增爲六十元又三等室原定十元後漲十二元七一起增至十五元云</p>

<p>自國民政府工商部修改商會法後全　國商會咸依此法改組月之二十一日上海商整會召集全市同業公會代表大會即依新商會法選舉執監委員而成立上海市商會此會爲全國商會所注意故不憚繁瑣將各報未詳之處條録如下簽到騐證該會因是日出席會員有三百餘人爲鄭重起見事前發有出席證詳註公會名稱代表姓名并編列號碼而蓋章證上號碼與會塲席次號碼相同對號入席簽到時先騐此證然後發給徽章與議案等印刷品</p>
<p>會塲槪况會塲在二樓席次分三行十四排每一長桌設座九位桌上覆以白毯并備天然墨拍紙簿及毛筆鉛筆茶碗各一台上懸有紅底金字横額中設一桌爲主席台右爲紀録席各機關代表分坐於總理遺象之下</p>
<p>徽章式别該會是日所發徽章均以緞帶製約長五寸上有青天白日之標識分淡紅大紅本色三種淡紅書主席團三字大紅書會員代表四字本色書司儀紀録糾察招待等名稱感佩於胸際</p>
<p>忙煞王隢籟商整會常務委員王曉籟是日爲主席團之一由渠致開會辭聲音宏亮與其唱草橋關飾姚琪時相仿討論章程時提前攝影因會場太大由月台上向演説者攝影後又在台之左右向各代表攝影兩幀對光發䤼等事均聽王君指揮奔來奔去甚覺忙碌</p>
<p>不見虞洽卿虞洽卿三字婦孺皆知付之一笑··　海客</p>

<p>乙丨我這幾天眞忙極了整</p>
<p>日的没有空閒幾乎連吃飯的工夫都没有</p>
<p>甲丨能者多勞那是一定的但你在忙着甚麽事情啊乙丨忙着找一個相當的職業因爲我失業巳久了</p>
<p>父丨學校中的學生們往往彼此互題綽號隨口亂呌孩子你在學校中可有甚麽綽號没有</p>
<p>子丨他們呌我［草根］</p>
<p>父丨這綽號倒也新奇你知道内中包含着甚麽意思啊</p>
<p>子丨因爲我每次考試名次每在全班同學之下而草根也總是在底下的</p>
<p>甲丨世界最偉大的人物是那一種人</p>
<p>乙丨是理髮匠</p>
<p>甲丨理髮匠是一種賤業你怎麽恭維他們是世界最偉大的人物呢</p>
<p>乙丨不見世界各國大人物無論怎樣高不可攀的也總得在理髪匠的一雙手下低頭麽</p>
<p>且爲商整會常務委員是日未見出席咸以爲奇蓋因虞君因服務公衆事業太多精神不濟恐被舉爲執行委員故航業公會推代表時渠令其子順懋擔任而自己退出非特是日不出席并抽去被選資格矣</p>
<p>手忙脚不亂我國舊諺有手忙脚亂之語是日該會自上午九時開會起至下午六時止各代表靜坐六句鐘兩足無用武之地中午備有大菜即在席上共食爲保貴時差起見且吃且議逢表决時須放下刀叉而舉手選舉執監委員時又須親塡被選者之姓名故手與脚是日之工作忙閑懸殊焉</p>

<p>楊非我</p>
<p>在國民革命愈進展新文藝卻愈消沉　的現代文壇吾人所能看到的祗有高唱着貴族階級的古典主義文藝或者盡力叫喊無産階級的文藝使我人感受着的祇是失望和悲哀嘆新舊文藝之日趨没落萬不料在失望和悲哀没落的近代文壇中竟然能使我人獲到意外的曙光是應如何地歡呼慶賀</p>
<p>久聞民族主義文藝連動者積極進行努力的結果他們的刋物也就於本月二十二日呱呱隋地了它在量的方面雖則是祗有四開新聞紙大小的一張似乎是很弱弱可是一究其内容已很能表示它們的使命熱烈勇敢的精神實有挽救中國文藝没落的氣慨</p>
<p>前鋒創刋號共有［中國文藝的没落］［民族主羲與文藝的關係］［魯迅先生的遠識］生財有道錢杏頓］［所謂主義的奴才］符咒與法師］以及發刋詞等七篇在［中國文藝的没落］和［民族主義與文藝的關係］二篇内是昭示着挽救中國文藝的途徑舊文藝没落了新文藝也没南洋游記（二六）　　　　　　花</p>
<p>初三日近來頗忙無暇爲日記在各校講演亦示得記之大　此間敎育之缺乏在不能統　一無研究會其故有二一在殖民地内有系統之集會爲政府所不許而又加以各小團體地方公所林立不能相下故各同鄕謀各同鄉之敎育亦無能聯絡此因分　　也會有一次組織全體敎育會因不能立案而阻止而且敎育機關吳立案進　政府可以補助發費不過同時一切章程須受英政府之干涉入其圈中故此會不能成立於是又思　一法用同響會名養於福建同鄉會中設一敎育科聘某君通敎育者任科長因同響會已經政府識可科良自不成問題此亦促進敎育聯絡之法也</p>
<p>至女學更爲幼稚最可笑者女校不能聘男敎員男校不能聘女敎員此例在前清中國尙不如此頑固而新加坡至今守此風可知其舊習也及至檳榔嶼則此風已䂭例如女子工商校長爲黎綬榮先生已辦其校九年可證明檳城風氣優於星洲也關於此　想在今日之時勢星洲亦不能久守故習且不過各校校長均例須任課至每週十二時之多如此繁重亦不經濟之甚所内中學校長兼課者少校長兼課事實上犧牲全校之進步甚大也又南洋一運弊校長背後有此謂一校之總理總理乃資本家爲之大致通敎育者甚少事事仰其鼻息甚至校中開一會不得總理許可竟不能開此亦敎育不進步之一大原因也有以上種南洋敎育機關之凝滯破碎支離如此而欲研究進步蓋甚難矣當今之世不大聯合無以適應大勢也且南洋如此寓　庶之區而無一專門以上學校莫論大學其文化不進不亦宜乎夫中國敎育已　日本規模之寳整日本小學學生動以數千計一切合羣整齊而共進今南洋不知合大羣一切守　法殊可惜也　陳子實君言此間學生成績亦不亞國内往國内考各大學者不乏人且言此問文化之將來或有可進步盛於國内之希望因現在是物質中心時代南洋各地經濟旣優只要建設文化事業自然容易將來未可量也余然之今日進化後勝於前美出自英今已代英面　全球日本出於中國今已覇東亞南洋出於中國吾甚希望其興於南洋亦意中事則非文化敎育不爲功耳落了而學悟着不能絶然任其没落也萬不能任其没有自然就應抖擻起堅忍的精神努力於文藝的革命即就是努力於民族主義的文藝運動走我人應走的光明大道看完了這兩篇作品或許就能了解文藝的正確的理論和認識中國文藝的出路了</p>
<p>同時[前鋒]除開了發揚他們的理論外他們又儘量地揭普羅作家的眞面目這在[魯迅先生的遠識][生財有道錢杏]邨][所謂主義的奴才][符咒與法師]等四篇内就可以使我人曉得了原來如是如是的普羅作家這就是他們的特質也就是他們的精神在[民族主義與文藝關係]的一篇上明白地這樣説[是要不得的歹的損害民族的不論是屬於任何一流人的行動民族主義文藝都要加以意識的排擊]　[總之民族主義文藝是從民族的立塲以發揚民族精神的目的的文藝是有希望的有力的解部而至於批評的文藝是握着時代精神的文藝]看了這段結論我人更可明瞭他們的目的和精神了吧沉寂的中國文壇没落的中國文藝的現代産生了這枝生力軍自然就是中國文藝的救星驚醒文藝界來認識自己民族的意識呵</p>
<p>知訊月之二十九日爲魏炷益先生與　眖君女士在大中華飯店禮堂舉行婚禮之期有雅晶社喪演歌舞新劇及八洕雅集票友綵串京劇如彩樓配托兆碰碎打嚴嵩全本鴻鸞禧全本鳳凰山全本御碑亭等均屬佳作（若其）</p>

<p>文藝與民族意識　應鵬</p>
<p>近來一部分同人努力於文藝上[民　族意識］的喚醒這是使現在的文學　和藝術萌發了强有力的生機當然　引起共鳴是不免的事現在把平　日的隨筆關於民族族與文藝問題的　發表一些寫的時候當然没有精密　的系統只好逐日在這裹發表一節　預備有機會的時候再整理成篇</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在中國講民族主義的文藝運動如果頭腦不清的話一定有人會誤會到［保存國粹］這一點去這實在是一個大大的錯誤中國所有的一切並不能都是説［粹］大部分也許是［粕］中國智識份子所製造的文藝不外乎三種思想的表現一種是利祿觀念一種是厭世觀念一種是命運觀念這三種都是在以個人爲中心與民族毫不相干這等思想在民族的立塲上便應該極端的排斥</p>
<p>中國歷史上封建制度的時期太長了也許是中國封建政治其組織較歐洲爲完備精密的緣故因此陰陽五行的哲學中庸的理敎在中國便做了文化的中心封建制度下適用的人生觀便是齊家治國平天下這自處於統治者支配者的地位是很顯然的所以封建制度下的一切文化便根本不是民族的文化</p>
<p>中國家族制度的組織最初確乎是拿民族精神做出發點的但是因爲封建政治的去配理敎哲學的融化便成了畸形的病態的發展結果狹義的宗法社會組織日見嚴密基礎日見鞏固而民族精神反以消失因此中國有知識的份子的［爲人之道］出了家庭不是個人便是天下所謂氏族意識除了在受異族壓迫的時候會有一刹那間的發現但極短的期間便仍會消失</p>
<p>中國經過幾次的被異族征服但民族意識在民間尙有相當的藴藏辛亥以後政體的形式雖然改革而封建勢力依然鞏固尤其是握政權者對於民間的思想·行動·組織·嗜好絶對不去理會對於民間娱樂·集會·依舊是禁止對於民問的歌謡·傳説·依舊是取締研究民俗學的誤爲民族學研究民俗者不把研究的精神集中在［民族意識］上不從如何去發掘民間所藴藏的［民族意識］的寳藏上着想這眞是可異固然中國的民間娛樂或集會民間的歌謡或傳説不免尙含有一部分出世思想和封建思想的遺毒但比較上所謂士大夫的製作當然這種成分要少得多我們應該站在民族精神的一點上去仔細剖折分别取去在這一方面不容我們一筆抹煞否則便是摧殘自已的民族精神</p>
<p>民間思想中含有的［民族意識］我們從江湖的會黨從太平天國從義和團從興中會一切的運動已經有很大的證據證明一粒［民族意識］的種子經過若干時期漂流若干地方終於開出中華民族的花像這一種可寳貴的東西一向埋没而不蒙智識份子去理會的豈知直到現在還是得不到智識份子的理會　　［民族意識］是集團性的是向上性的是積極性的是奮鬭性的是創造性的這都是從爭生存爭自由爭繁榮的目的産生的所以我們看見民間的思想行動民間的風謡傳説以及其它的一切如果具有這種性質的當然便應該認爲民族之寳</p>
<p>中華民族經了幾千年的壓迫民間的［民族意識］的發展經過許多的艱難與挫折在民間的埋藏的種子還没有普遍而左知識份子中尤其是應該有急切的喚醒</p>

<p>看復旦西哈諾後　　問鵑</p>
<p>法國曷斯當的名作［西哈諾］一劇復旦劇社已經公演了很多次我雖然十分愛好藝術可是常常爲一班淺薄而不成熟的舞臺動作所嚇怕所以始終没有毅然參觀她的勇氣本月十九日梅雨霏霏的時候Ｗ姊急急走來找我約我和她同去看西哈諾我躊躇了一陣子一半也是却不過她的面情終於拿起雨衣到了海寗路的新中央戲院接過説明書一看知道主角仍是馬彦祥君心裹便非常高興因爲我的耳朶告訴我馬君在現時戲劇界是一位不可多得的人才</p>
<p>幕開了許多騎士們的服裝和動作還都能夠和劇本相差不遠西哈諾的出現正如一輪紅日湧出雲間的一般使全塲頓增精采當西哈諾説到［我呌你們不許響先生是你嗎不是］的時候凡是被他的劍尖所指著的人們都現出一種極害怕不堪的神氣那立在樓梯脚下的幾個人竟嚇得幾乎想逃到樓上去這些烘托得都非常之好還有西哈諾和伐而浮比劍的時候包廂中的霍克桑渾身抖擻和面孔改色的樣子劇本上雖有補筆但當時動作方面却並没有寫明這些都是導演者的細心之處觀劇的人們所不應該忽略過的第一幕裹的人數這樣多我起初很怕他們要失敗然而演來還很能夠使人滿意不過這位賣花女上塲的神氣未免太没有戲情太忘記她是在演劇了糖菓女就比較好自然和老練得多</p>
<p>末後西哈諾和勒勃亥訴説心事他説到</p>
<p>［我也夢想著手腕上有一個情侣偎抱著緩步月影我情思激越忘懷了一切憂愁忽的看見我的側影又現出在花園的牆頭］他一路走一路念而面部和全身的表情動作時而纒綿時而激越最終以失望的悲哀作結不要説劇中的勒勃亥被他説得感動就是池子裹的我們也幾乎要下淚了後來他接受霍桑的期約的時候驚喜和措亂的神情演來也恰到好處</p>
<p>第二幕是詩人的糕餅店去哈格諾的吳樹德君也是很不差的在那些詩人們念詩的時候他這種叉著手傾聽的態度是極自然的他是榚餅師同時又是一個詩人這樣兩重人格的角色是不容易出色的然而他演來這很能適合劇中人的個性</p>
<p>西哈諾寫信時候的痴情顛倒和頻頻問鐘點的神氣都很深刻等到霍克桑説出了她愛著的是克利斯將這句話以後他的喪氣和失望眞呌人同情然而這還不難難的是抑制情感毅然答應她保護他的情敵這種偉大而犧牲的精神祗有西哈諾才能做得到而我們舞臺上的西哈諾能夠體貼到劇中人的英雄羣措和偉大的愛情使視衆們覺得戴大帽披披風的人眞是西哈諾的時候這種工夫也不是有相當文學修養的人所能做得到的</p>
<p>去霍克桑的梁女士她的先天的長處帮助她眞是不少一種嬌小姐的嬌態很令人可愛當此女界藝術人才缺乏的時候總算難能而可貴的了</p>
<p>第三幕是震克桑的重要表演在月光掩映之間我們的霍克桑也眞似月宫仙子似的出現在凉臺之上了一切對話都還不差不過臨了新婚慘别的當兒似乎太缺乏表情劇本上的霍克桑當持吉許勒逼克利期將出發的時候是衝入克利斯將懷中呼克利斯將的然而她不敢這樣做大槪是怕羞吧我們或者應該加以原諒的至於克利斯將被拖著出去而死命掙扎著用手送她一吻的神氣却是很有研究的</p>
<p>第四幕加斯買的見習軍官可以説滑稽多於傷心許許多多軍官們的醉態和餓荒的樣子頗爲好笑等到克利斯將覺悟了愛情的失敗而死滑稽的空氣一變而爲極度的悲哀但是克利斯將臨死以前的失望和决心演來也極慷慨激昂之至唐遠蕃君也算是成功的此時霍克桑的表情依然缺少緊張當一個愛人受傷將死的時候應該如何悲傷如何震動劇本上也有［我覺得他偎著我的臉氷冷了］一語那末霍克桑至少要抱他一抱成用面頰偎他一下然而她不曾這樣做自始至終的霍克桑總缺乏熱情缺乏胆量不知是導演者的疏忽還是梁女士自已不肯呢在此只好存爲一種疑問了</p>
<p>最後一幕的我們的霍克桑却是比較的老練了她大槪是一位神經質的小姐宜於演悲哀而嫻靜的戲劇的她在繡著綳子等待西哈諾時候的神氣可以説完全把一切的心情都表現出來了她的面部表情也是比時最好西哈諾到來訣别他的笑容和他的疲　越做越入神在落葉飄蕭的暮靄蒼茫的尼庵裹一個穿孝的寡婦對著一個垂死的故人丨一個合詩人劍客的衆美爲一的西哈諾又是英雄</p>

<p>中華民国十九年</p>
<p>遲暮受予爱的創傷而忍死须臾的時候這是一種何等的境界我的眼淚浸濕着眼鏡玻璃了竟不敢再看一看這位英雄臨終時的情景我是何等地可笑啊不過霍克桑發現西哈諾便是她所爱的克利斯將的靈魂的時候應該還要多一點轉折多一點舉動否則太平淡似乎有點不合事實了我細閲劇本她説[這個聲音]的時候是應當[發著抖的]雖然這總算是小疵西哈諾將死她兩手掩面哭著這様哭法倒很合身分因爲她已是久居尼庵的孀婦了全劇焦點在此一幕也是梁女士最後成功的一節至於马君的西哈諾自始至終無懈可擊對於藝術很有鑒别力的艾姊她也説[滿意滿意]</p>
<p>全劇佈景見出導演者已盡了他的心力除開一些小節以外總是很對得住原作者的這全體的服装和用具大約很花了劇團不少的錢吧不過霍克桑出門赴戰地的時節好像總應當戴上她的帽子和手套　　青年園地稿例</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<p>The Dispute Between France and Italy</p>
<p>The conflict between France and Italy is a crisis for Europe in the future. Italy, as a newly emerging country after the war, is determined to revitalize and unwilling to yield to others. France, as the leading country in Europe after the war, strives to take the lead and is unwilling to be second to anyone. This is the major reason for the conflict between the two countries. In addition, there are countless other factors that may lead to disputes and intensify them, whether due to historical relations or geographical proximity. As for the mutual attacks in newspapers and the mutual slander of responsible persons, these are just minor matters. France's borders have been fortified with defense works, negotiations between the two countries' navies have been shelved, and other policies of forming alliances among small countries have already begun. Who will be the enemy in Europe in the future if not France and Italy?</p>
<p>The conflict between France and Italy in the international arena and the mutual antagonism between Britain and India in the colonial and metropolitan countries are both situations that cannot be resolved immediately. This is because both sides are determined and seek to achieve their goals, and neither side can back down. Therefore, it is clear to everyone that the means used, whether strong or weak, slow or intense, are intentional and not accidental. According to physical principles, the deeper the cause planted today, the greater the result will be in the future. This is inevitable.</p>
<p>In short, misfortunes in the world often arise from unintentional misunderstandings that eventually lead to resentment and revenge. The latter is often heard of. However, it is rare in the world for prejudices to increase with suspicion and yet disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams 2</p>
<p>The Political Affairs Committee's Foreign Affairs Group</p>
<p>Discusses the Tianjin Customs Incident</p>
<p>Belles Distributes Salaries to Customs Officers</p>
<p>Simpson and Others Hold Meetings</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Affairs Committee held a meeting at the Central Committee on the morning of the 25th after the adjournment of the Central Political Affairs Committee meeting. Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Wang Zhengting, and others attended. Wang Zhengting reported on the handling of the Tianjin Customs incident and the note to the British ambassador requesting punishment for Simpson. He also stated that Japan was quite dissatisfied with Yan's actions regarding the Tianjin Customs incident, and that the rumors that the consular corps would take over the customs revenue were untrue. After the report, the members decided not to discuss it further because the British ambassador's reply had not yet arrived in Beijing. They decided to wait for the British response and then determine their course of action. This reporter interviewed a member who attended the meeting in the afternoon and asked about the report that the National Government had telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to send the Northeast Fleet to seal off Tianjin outside Dagu Port. The member replied that this measure was a last resort and was not yet the time to implement it, as it would have a significant impact on commerce and could only be implemented if absolutely necessary (June 25th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>Tianjin: Former Customs Commissioner Belles distributed the June salaries to the striking customs officers at the Customs Club on the 25th. Someone asked when he would lead the striking customs officers south, and Belles replied that he would have to wait for a telegram from the Inspector General. When asked when the telegram would arrive, he replied that he did not know. The customs officers dispersed after receiving their salaries (June 25th Special Dispatch). Tianjin: At 3:00 PM on the 25th, Simpson invited Ge Jingyou to study methods to deal with the double tax collection in Shanghai. The discussion lasted until 6:00 PM without a satisfactory solution. At 9:00 PM, he went to Mayor Cui's residence and invited Commander Yuan, the director of transportation, and more than ten others to discuss the matter. It is heard that the Bankers' Association and the General Chamber of Commerce plan to find a way to mediate the customs crisis, but cannot do so in Tianjin and must go to Shanghai to conduct negotiations with both parties. The situation at Changhai is very good, and salaries are scheduled to be paid on the 28th (June 25th Special Dispatch).</p>
<p>Tianjin: Simpson and Supervisor Ge held a meeting at Mayor Cui's residence at 10:00 PM on the 25th to discuss the issue of double tax collection by the Shanghai Customs. After repeated deliberations, they could not find a good solution. Finally, they decided that if the Shanghai Customs had already collected the Tianjin import tax, they would ask the Shanghai Customs to transfer a sum of money to the Tianjin Customs, which would then no longer collect the tax. Fortunately, most of the customs duties are used to guarantee foreign debts, so whether the tax is collected in Shanghai or Tianjin does not make much difference. However, two ships that departed from Shanghai for Tianjin on the 20th entered the port on the 25th, claiming to have paid taxes in Shanghai but had no proof. It was decided to require these two ships to pay a deposit and then request proof from the Shanghai Customs that they had collected the Tianjin import tax on their behalf. The deposit would be refunded after verification. However, this plan was not fully decided, and the meeting had not adjourned by 12:00 AM. On the 25th, the situation at the Tianjin Customs Bureau remained unchanged. In recent days, a steady stream of new Chinese and foreign staff have been assigned to fill the vacancies of the old staff. Customs brokers are now unwilling to handle import and export goods. Those who wish to do so must be handled by the consignee or the carrier, who must pay the tax item by item (June 25th Reuters Electric).</p>

<p>Ji Wen Discusses the Tianjin Customs Incident</p>
<p>Nanjing: Liu Jiwen, the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, came to Beijing on the 24th and had some contact with the Ministry of Finance. On the morning of the 25th, he attended the meeting of the Central Political Affairs Committee and reported on the current situation of the Jianghai Customs. It was decided that he would return to Shanghai that evening. According to Liu, there are already ways to deal with Yan's forcible collection of import and export taxes after the closure of the Tianjin Customs. As for the Jianghai Customs, it has been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to collect taxes on behalf of the Tianjin Customs, which has already been implemented. According to foreign merchants, they will definitely not want to ship goods to Tianjin again next time to avoid being taxed twice.

<p>British Conservative Party</p>
<p>Trusts Baldwin as Party Leader</p>
<p>Reuters, London, June 24: The Conservative Party held a conference at Caxton Hall today to determine the Conservative Party's policy on imperial free trade. About 400 people attended. This meeting was not open to the public, but it was heard that Conservative Party leader Baldwin stated the policy of actively reducing expenses, effectively defending industry and the empire, and closer economic unity, accompanied by mutual preferential treatment. He also said that the issue of a national referendum on food taxes was a way to seek party unity. Baldwin then criticized the newspapers of Rothermere and Beaverbrook, saying that the most bizarre thing in recent evolution is the influence of the newly rich and the control of their own newspapers, which seems to be destroying the balance and intoxicating people. Looking at the Hearst newspapers in the United States and the Rothermere and Beaverbrook newspapers in Britain, they have gone beyond the scope of newspapers and are engaged in directing, manipulating, and intimidating. He also said that some people oppose him as the leader of the Conservative Party, and he accepts this challenge and denounces it as madness. Beaverbrook and Rothermere hope to manipulate the selection of cabinet members in the next Conservative Party cabinet. Such outrageous demands have never been seen by the leader of any political party. The meeting unanimously passed a formal motion condemning the Beaverbrook and Rothermere newspapers and trusting Baldwin as party leader and his policies. A proposal was made to amend the motion, stating that food taxes should not be submitted to a national referendum, and that future Conservative Party governments should attend the imperial conference with the freedom to agree with overseas autonomous regions. Although this proposal was met with cheers, it was ultimately rejected.</p>

<p>Prevents Parliament from Discussing</p>

The Socialist Party in Parliament has requested the election of a special committee to investigate the details of the matter, and the actual expenditure of the national treasury has been approved by the Budget Committee and will be submitted to the conference on Tuesday. Therefore, the French government has made this decision. At that time, French Prime Minister Théo will ask Parliament to reject it without discussion and will use this as a matter of government confidence. It is expected that Parliament will concede because, except for the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, no one wants to cause public discussion about the huge amount of money misappropriated for secret military equipment.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Zhang Guijun's Counterattack on Youxian Fails <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>After Jiang and Cai's divisions captured Youxian, they advanced towards Liling and Pingxiang. Huang Shaoxiong's troops were defeated by Jiang's division in Changning. According to a Guangzhou dispatch, after the Eighth Route Army poured into Hunan, Zhang Guijun was attacked from both sides in Changsha, Yueyang and was forced to withdraw from Changsha. A portion planned to return from Liling to counterattack Youxian. At the same time, Huang Shaoxiong's troops, who were lingering on the Guilin border, attempted to sneak into Changning from Lingling to try to cut off the rear of Hengzhou. Fierce battles have been taking place in the Youxian area since the 17th. It is reported that the enemy troops are a certain unit of the Gui Army, which launched a fierce attack on the Shen Guanghan brigade and the Pi Cai division training regiment in Youxian. Cai's division launched three assaults on Youxian before defeating the enemy, who retreated towards Zhuting and Xinshi. Cai's division estimated on the 18th that the enemy in Youxian was still trying to hold firm, with the appearance of entering Pingxiang. Therefore, after Cai's division of the Eighth Route Army captured Youxian from the right, Jiang Guangnai's division from Hengshan also detoured from Youxian, concentrating the Guo Enyan regiment and the Hua Zhenzhong and Zhang Shide brigades to Youxian. Immediately, they searched and suppressed the area towards Zhushi, Xinting and Liling. Recently, the second batch of troops arriving in Chenzhou, the Zhang Li regiment, the Fan Dexing regiment and the Wang Dinghua regiment, have been marching to Youxian at full speed in order to take over the defense of Youxian, so that the Jiang and Cai divisions on the front line can pursue Liling. At the same time, Li Yangjing's division and Huang Yanzhen's brigade, which were going to Xiangtan on the left, did not encounter any fighting due to the rapid retreat of Zhang Guijun's troops in Xiangtan. On the 19th, they continued to advance from Xiaohuashi to Huangmao. It is expected that they will meet with the Jiang and Cai troops advancing towards Liling during the day to encircle and annihilate the remaining enemies. As for the southern Hunan area, the military situation in Changning has also been quite smooth recently. Huang Shaoxiong, who was recently in Lingling, sent Huang Xuchu's troops, about two to three thousand men, into Changning on the 17th. Jiang Guangnai, hearing the news at the front, immediately sent a regiment from Li's division and a regiment from the division south along Baifang to meet and engage Huang's troops in a fierce battle for half a day. At the same time, the Yue Shao Pass Headquarters also sent four aircraft from Nanhai, Guangzhou, Panyu and Zhujiang to the Changning front to bomb the enemy. At noon on the 18th, the four aircraft circled in the sky and dropped bombs, and the enemy began to flee in panic. The Shao Pass Headquarters received a telegram from Jiang Guangnai yesterday reporting that [the Guangzhou aircraft landed five miles away from our army's position in Changning. The aircraft was slightly damaged, but the personnel are safe. The enemy troops in Changning have been defeated by our army. Signed, Jiang Guangnai, at Shenke]. Since the enemy troops in southern Hunan have been defeated, the Eighth Route Army will drive north to Liling and Pingxiang. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, has made a special trip to Hunan and arrived in Yizhang with the headquarters staff on the 20th. He will arrive in Chenzhou tomorrow.

Yesterday, General Commander Lu telegraphed Chairman Jiang and President Tan, requesting them to appoint someone to act as chairman or to be appointed by the provincial government to take over the important post. Once the National Government's reply arrives, he will be able to depart.

<h3 id="e6">Case of French Sailors Shooting and Wounding Chinese Police <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>French Consul in Hankou Files a Counter-Protest</p>
<p>Municipal Government Prepares a Serious Refutation</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that in the case of French sailors stationed in Hankou shooting and wounding Chinese police officer Liu Jinshan on the 14th of this month, the Hankou Municipal Government has made serious representations to the French Consul in Hankou. Yesterday, the 23rd, the municipal government received a reply from French Consul Berthes, not only denying that there was a shooting of a Chinese police officer, but also protesting to the municipal government that the detention of French officer Ge Qing by the Chinese police station was detrimental to the treaty. It is heard that the municipal government has now decided to issue a serious refutation to clarify the responsibility. The original letter from the French Consul is recorded below: [In reply:] I acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter of yesterday and understand its contents. In order to continue the negotiations between the two parties on Sunday of last week and the letter given to you at that time, this consul makes a serious protest to your mayor regarding the handling of the incident by the 11th Precinct on the night of the 14th. The reason why this consul is firm on this point and repeatedly discusses it is that the responsible authorities of your country seem to have forgotten to fulfill the various treaties signed between China and France. French residents should be tried by the French authorities, especially naval crew members. Therefore, the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau authorities should be to immediately transfer the sailors to their officers, and the officers should transfer them to their ship captain, in accordance with the treaties between our two countries. Even if the perpetrator of the incident is apprehended, this should be done in this way. However, it was necessary for this consul to contact you late at night to prove the innocence of naval officer Mr. Ge Qing before he could be released. As for the facts, the captains of the two warships anchored in this port have already joined this consul in a detailed investigation of the matter. The details are as follows: (1) Naval officer Mr. Ge Qing was originally on the "Martyr" warship. After the captain received news of the incident, Mr. Ge Qing was ordered by the captain, along with another colleague, to go to the scene of the incident to investigate and verify that the muzzle of his gun did not match the fired bullet. (2) French sailors cannot be held responsible for the indiscriminate firing of guns on Er Yao Road. French sailors are absolutely prohibited from carrying firearms when they go ashore. Moreover, the chief of the 11th Precinct personally witnessed and searched the body at the Palermo Cafe, which can be used as evidence that French sailors did not fire guns illegally. Only someone reported to you that only French sailors were on the street at the time of the incident. It is not difficult for this report to be shown to you to be inaccurate. It is known that a sailor from another country was also injured on this street, indicating that there were not only French sailors on the street. This consul does not need to point out who it is, but cannot listen to rumors that disturb people's hearing. (3) The two French gunners in the Mengduo Cafe were also arrested and taken to the 11th Precinct when they went out. They were not only tied up, but also abused. It is feared that they did not report to the precinct chief when they were detained here. A doctor's explanation is attached for reference. Furthermore, this consul must inform you that this is absolutely someone falsely identifying Mr. Ge Qing as the gun-firing murderer, inciting the police and the public with lies, and deceiving the 11th Precinct chief, so that the police and judicial authorities were led astray on an erroneous path from the beginning. French sailors were detained for several hours, and French military officers were detained for even longer, just like other criminals, and then violence was inflicted on two French sailors who had absolutely nothing to do with the matter, which is extremely inappropriate. I hereby send this letter to your mayor for your investigation and consideration. (1) An apology should be made to the commander of our country's navy regarding the insult to the French naval officer and French sailors. (2) The perpetrator of the crime should be punished. As for whether our government will have other demands in the future, this consul will first reserve all rights. This consul and the captain of our country's "Martyr" warship are extremely grateful for the meeting you granted at one o'clock the previous night. I hereby express my gratitude and wish you good health.</p>

<p>The Provincial Government Lists the Names of Bandit Lairs and Bandit Leaders</p>
<p>Orders the Department of Civil Affairs to Instruct Various Counties to Annihilate Them Within a Time Limit</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou reports that Guangdong Province recently, with the war still ongoing and the Gui situation just settled, has again successively transferred large numbers of troops to Hunan Province. During this period of troop movements, the defense arrangements were temporarily incomplete, or the incoming troops failed to succeed the outgoing troops seamlessly. At times, there may be vacuums in the local areas, and bandits lurking in the mountains may rise up and cause trouble, harming the villages. The authorities have recently received numerous reports of banditry from various places and have strictly ordered local officials to earnestly and thoroughly suppress the bandits to eliminate the people's suffering. It is found that the most rampant banditry recently is in Dongjiang. Because the subordinate areas of Dongjiang have suffered consecutive years of disaster, the remnants of the bandits are lurking. Once the government troops are transferred, they will come out and cause disturbances. Moreover, the terrain of Dongjiang borders on Fujian and Jiangxi, making it easier for bandit parties to enter and exit. Recently, after the Jiang Division of the Dongjiang Defense Army was transferred to Hunan, the bandits in the Chao and Mei areas took advantage of the opportunity before Xiang Hanping's troops could take over. For example, Jiaoling, a subordinate area of Mei, has recently been invaded by communist bandits from Wuping and Yanqian on the Fujian border. The county magistrate of Xunwu County on the Jiangxi border has even fled to Jiaoling with his staff. Moreover, Shekeng in Mei County has been raided by bandits from Raoping, and the post has also been robbed. Bingcun was besieged by bandits several times on the 4th. Kuitan near Haifeng has recently reported repeated bandit alarms. In addition, pirates in the five counties of Nanhai, Panyu, Dongguan, Shunde and Zhongshan under the Guangzhou Prefecture are rampant, obstructing waterways and robbing villages and ferries from time to time. Especially in Zhongshan County, the subordinate area has recently suffered the most from bandit disasters. The provincial government has received repeated reports and has ordered the relevant authorities to investigate the places where the bandits gather and list the names of the bandit gangs. In addition to consulting with the military authorities and ordering the defense army to suppress them, it has also ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to instruct the various counties to cooperate with the police teams to earnestly suppress the bandits in order to reassure the people. The original order stated: "It is found that the areas of Sanshan, Zidong, Jili and Huangguajiao in Nanhai County; Shibi, Shenyong and Motiedie of Panyu; Juhuawan, Heqian, Ganzhutan, Guohai, Huoshaotou, Banshawei and Yinggejui of Shunde County; Baihuatou and Baigongsha of Zhongshan County; Daojiao, Zhangpeng and Hongwuwu of Dongguan County; Lanwei, Dushu, Laoshushi, Yuezhang, Xiancun and Tuqian of Dongjiang County are all areas where bandits frequently appear. Orders have been issued repeatedly for clearing and suppression. Recently, bandit leaders Luo Ji Hong, Chen Shiyao, Zhang Dingji, Zhang Ru, He Fei, Lei Gongquan, Tang Lai, Chen Duanmin, He Ran, He Yu, Liao Liu, Liang Sao, Liang Xiang, Deng Han, Yiya Zai, Chen Dizai, Yuan Doupi, Yuan Da Zeng, Luo Bu Xu Zhendong Guan Hong and others have taken advantage of the troop transfers and departures to loot and bomb ferries on a large scale. Such rampant harm is extremely serious and should be severely suppressed to maintain security. In addition to requesting Commander-in-Chief Chen to dispatch troops to the counties of Nanfan, Zhongshun and Dong to assist the counties in clearing them within a time limit, please also request Commander Chen of the Navy to consider the situation and dispatch patrol ships to station at the key points of each river and order the ships in each section to patrol carefully and protect them effectively. It is still necessary to cooperate with the battalions and counties to block and intercept the bandits in order to advance by both land and water and clear them as soon as possible. The director of the department is also ordered to strictly order the magistrates of the above-mentioned counties to mobilize the entire county's corps police force to meet with the fleet and properly formulate a joint suppression plan, dividing the troops and launching attacks within a specified period of one month to annihilate all bandit gangs and ensure the safety of travelers. The department shall also report the compliance situation at any time for inspection. There shall be no delays. The district and township police teams in the counties along the river have the responsibility to protect the local area. In the future, if there are any bombings of ferries in the section, and they fail to provide immediate assistance or fail to solve the case afterwards, how should they be severely punished to serve as a warning? The department shall also formulate a proper plan for presentation and compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Phenomenon of Finance in Shanxi Province <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan reports that there are generally three types of banknotes circulating in this province: Shanxi Provincial Bank banknotes, Bank of China banknotes, and private banknotes issued by merchants in various counties and cities. Bank of China banknotes declined sharply two years ago. Although the bank still maintains a branch in Taiyuan, it is only to maintain appearances. The issuance of private banknotes by merchants in various counties and cities is rampant. The face value of the banknotes ranges from as high as several tens of yuan to as low as five copper coins. The exchange rate of private banknotes for one silver dollar varies greatly, with some requiring more than ten thousand and others requiring six or seven thousand. Moreover, these private banknotes have no guarantee whatsoever. Every time they are moved to another county, they become worthless paper. In recent years, the losses suffered by people in various counties from these private banknotes have been enormous, and the financial system of the entire province has been disrupted and harmed. Last year, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance jointly issued an order to the counties, ordering the merchants to recall the private banknotes they had issued in three phases and destroy them. The third phase is about to expire, and the results are still considerable. It is expected that they will be able to be completely recalled in the near future. At present, the only banknotes circulating throughout the province are those of the Provincial Bank. There are two types of Provincial Bank banknotes: silver dollar banknotes and copper coin banknotes. The lowest denomination of silver banknotes is one jiao, and the highest is one hundred yuan. The lowest denomination of copper coin banknotes is ten coins, and the highest is one hundred coins. A year ago, the exchange rate of Provincial Bank banknotes for one silver dollar was only a few copper coins, and the remittance fee was an average of twenty or thirty yuan per thousand yuan. The exchange rate of copper coins for one silver dollar was an average of three hundred and sixty or seventy coins, and the exchange rate of copper coin banknotes for one silver dollar was an average of four hundred coins or so. After Yan Xishan and Li Bing went to Zhengzhou last year to supervise the troops during the campaign against Tang Shengzhi, unscrupulous merchants in Taiyuan engaged in large-scale speculation, raised remittance fees, and manipulated the price of Provincial Bank banknotes, causing the</p>

<p>June 26, 1930 (Shen Bao Third Sheet) Thursday</p>
<p>Price of Provincial Bank banknotes to fall to around 70% of its face value. For a time, the entire city was in a state of panic. Later, Yan returned from Zhengzhou and strongly advocated redemption, and the market began to stabilize slightly. Since the opening of redemption, a total of four to five million yuan was redeemed in less than ten days. Because unscrupulous merchants were transporting the redeemed silver dollars to the provincial government to buy banknotes and then transporting them to the province for redemption in order to make a profit, and some even buried the silver dollars underground and did not use them again, the original purpose of opening redemption was greatly lost. Therefore, the authorities resolutely stopped redemption again. Since then, the price of Provincial Bank banknotes has not been able to recover to the level of a year ago. When the recent war broke out, Provincial Bank banknotes fell sharply again. A week ago, one yuan of Provincial Bank banknotes fell to only five or six jiao. The prices of all goods in the market rose several times, and the people were in dire straits. The provincial government then ordered five agencies, including the Department of Finance and the Military Police Headquarters, to establish a remittance inspection committee to implement remittance inspection and restrict the outflow of silver dollars to stabilize remittance fees. The current remittance inspection committee stipulates that the remittance fee is 300 yuan per thousand yuan, but unscrupulous merchants still often comply with the regulations in appearance but violate them in reality. The prices of goods are still rising, but the people's morale in the market has greatly stabilized compared to before. Silver banknotes are no longer a major problem. The only problem is copper coin banknotes. The Department of Finance previously stipulated that the exchange rate of copper coin banknotes for silver dollars was 400 coins per yuan. This has been implemented smoothly for several months. The crux of the current problem is the exchange of copper coin banknotes for small change. Because there have been more copper coins than copper coin banknotes in this province for many years, the Department of Finance printed one million new copper coin banknotes last month and issued them to the Provincial Bank for use. Recently, the number of copper coin banknotes in the market has increased sharply, and the number of copper coins has been decreasing day by day. The lowest denomination of copper coin banknotes is ten coins, and there are often disputes and friction between shops in transactions due to the exchange of small change. This phenomenon has almost spread throughout the province. The Provincial Bank has previously reported this situation to the Department of Finance. Now the Department of Finance has formulated three measures for the exchange of copper coin banknotes and announced them for implementation in order to provide relief. This also shows the financial problems of this province. The exchange measures are appended below: (1) Anyone who comes to the bank to exchange up to 100 copper coin banknotes or 3 jiao of silver dollar banknotes will be paid 10 copper coins and the rest will be paid with the bank's copper coin banknotes or silver jiao banknotes (for example, if you hold a 10-coin banknote to exchange, you will be paid entirely with copper coins; if you hold a 20-coin banknote to exchange, you will be paid with half of the number and the rest by analogy). (2) Anyone who comes to the bank to exchange more than 100 copper coin banknotes or more than 3 jiao of silver dollar banknotes will be paid with one-tenth of the number of copper coins, but no matter how many silver or copper coin banknotes you exchange, you will not be paid more than 100 copper coins. The rest will be paid with the bank's copper coin banknotes or silver jiao banknotes. (3) Each person may not have more than two exchanges of copper coins per day. If there are more than two exchanges, they may be rejected.</p>

<p>Final Opinion of the Communications Committee</p>
<h3 id="e10">Li Shaogeng Decides to Mediate <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin on the 20th reports that Li Deyan, the Deputy Director of the Postal and Communications Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER), returned to Harbin on the 18th of this month after requesting instructions from Liaoning on the 17th. Mr. Li notified the Russian Chairman Jenissoff, requesting to continue negotiations and scheduled a meeting at the Railway Bureau on the afternoon of the 19th. The Russian side did not reply that night, so the meeting on the 19th did not succeed. Yesterday, Li went to see the Chinese representative and the Director-General of the Railway, Li Shaogeng, to deliver the Communications Committee's opinions on the CER electrical rights conference. Because the Russian Chairman went to Liaoning to attend the second anniversary of Zhang Zuolin's death, Li Shaogeng will mediate after his return to Harbin to bring the opinions of both sides closer. Then, a special committee will be convened to negotiate the contract terms and submit them to the General Assembly for approval. Jenissoff is scheduled to return to Harbin on the 24th. It is still difficult to predict whether this matter can be remedied during the exchange of opinions. It is heard that the Communications Committee's opinions are about four items, all of which concern international telecommunications and official electrical rights. The commercial electrical dispute has been deliberately abandoned. Therefore, it is said that this is an exchange of views, but it is better to say that it is a last resort and concession. Perhaps the Russian side, seeing that the conditions are not too harsh, will allow the conference to continue. It is also heard that the Communications Committee has planned that if the Russian side insists on its own opinions and only seeks to benefit its own side, the Communications Committee will no longer proceed with the conference and will directly announce that the old contract signed in 1922 is invalid. This measure is based on the 1922 old contract [If either party deems it necessary to abolish this contract, it may announce its invalidity, but the execution period must be implemented six months after the announcement]. Then, it will handle it itself. However, this move is only out of extreme necessity. If Soviet Russia does not push too hard, it will never take this action. Li Shaogeng, the acting Chinese Director-General of the Railway, is particularly unwilling to stir up unexpected waves with this, so he has been doing his best to mediate as a third party to bring the opinions of both sides closer and solve the problem in an orderly manner through the conference. It is also heard that the Chinese committee members have also drafted the telephone part of the proposal and will submit it for approval when the exchange of views is smooth this time.</p>

<p>The military and police authorities here, in order to consolidate local public security, have implemented a temporary curfew starting last night. After 12 o'clock, traffic is cut off. Soldiers are stationed in the suburbs and at major roads. It is heard that the curfew will last until the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce held its second representative assembly on the 5th of this month. Due to disputes over reorganization, the matter remained unresolved. Representatives were dispatched to Beijing and the provincial capital to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Provincial Party Headquarters. The representatives returned to Wuhu one after another yesterday. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the second representative assembly of the association should be held as usual, but made no statement on the reorganization issue. The association reopened the assembly this afternoon, concluded the proposals of the second session, and then adjourned. The reorganization issue has to be postponed. Four members of the provincial government committee, Ma Jidi, Jin Weixi, Li Yinsheng, and Zhang Keyao, recently sent a telegram to the Hefei natives association in Wuhu, stating that Hefei levied a special land tax for disaster relief regardless of the suffering of the people. They expressed extreme hatred and ordered the county magistrates to be dismissed and punished if they obeyed Yuan Lichen and dared to collect the tax. They have also telegraphed the central government to strongly advocate on behalf of the people.</p>
<p>Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Wang Zhijue, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Ma Jidi, Director of the He'an Office, jointly issued an order to the counties, stating that in these difficult times, the local area is unstable and the national army has other tasks. In order to be able to take both into account, if bandits occur in various counties in the future, the county magistrates should lead the local militia and police to suppress them. Those who rashly request troops and exaggerate the situation will be severely punished.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Department of Education has scheduled the second provincial education administrative conference to be held on July 1st. Ma Jingwen, Director of the Wuhu County Education Bureau, has prepared proposals on education administration funds, school education, and compulsory education, and is scheduled to go to the provincial capital on the 28th to attend.

<p>The provincial government ordered the arrest of the lake bandit leader and his gang leader, Taibao A Xu. They have been harassing merchants on Taihu Lake. After being severely suppressed by the military and police, they fled back to Liu Siqiao, Jinshan County, where they gather and disperse unpredictably. The Jinshan County magistrate had previously telegraphed the provincial government, which forwarded the information to the three-province bandit suppression commander for suppression to eliminate the root cause. Now, the provincial government has issued a general order to all its agencies to offer a reward of one thousand yuan for the arrest. The county government convened a meeting of district chiefs. The county government has many cases awaiting handling by various districts. It is now scheduled to convene a meeting of district chiefs on the 28th of this month to discuss and issue administrative expenses notices to various districts for compliance.</p>
<p>A tenant accused the landlord of theft. Li Zhou, a resident of the west of the city, rented out her surplus house to Lei Jiajun after her husband died. Recently, the Lei family suddenly accused the landlord of theft. Yesterday, the county government opened a court hearing. According to Li Zhou, Lei borrowed 350 yuan from her twice but refused to issue an IOU. Because he pried open the door twice attempting rape, she was forced to lend him the money to avoid losing her chastity. It was unbearable to live with him, so she moved elsewhere to avoid trouble. The items she moved that day were all her own. Moreover, Lei's servant, Xu Siwu, saw that the accusations were all slander. After questioning the witness Xu Siwu, the case was judged to require further investigation. Li Zhou was ordered to post bail pending interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandit robbery near Wuku. In the south of Wuku, Yuanmao and Shenjiabang were robbed on two successive nights. Bandits attempted to rob a certain family in Yuanmao. They had already pried open the door when the head of the household saw the light and quickly fled to a neighboring village to call for help, sounding the gong. The bandits then scattered and fled. It is heard that four families in Shenjiabang were robbed, but the extent of the losses is unknown.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>County police team's anti-bandit measures. Due to the resurgence of banditry in various villages, the county police brigade planned preventive measures yesterday (25th). It was decided that the first squadron would be stationed in Weiting, Xiangcheng, and Taiping Bridge to defend against the Yangcheng area. The second squadron would be stationed in Xietang, Chefang, and Chenmu to defend against the Chenghu area. The third squadron would be stationed in Guangfu, Puzhuang, and Xuzhuang to defend against the Taihu area. The fourth squadron will be responsible for garrisoning the urban area. The Department of Finance dispatches personnel to raise funds. Due to the urgent need for funds, the Department of Finance has specially dispatched a committee member to Suzhou to raise 20,000 yuan from the Finance Bureau. Zhu Boying, the head of the levy section, borrowed 10,000 yuan from various businesses and guilds. Interest will accrue from July 1st at a rate of 1.2% per month, to be repaid from this year's busy season tax revenue.</p>
<p>Military and police organize an inspection office. The local authorities received a telegram from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to organize a military and police inspection office. It is scheduled to be established today (26th) and will inspect newspapers.</p>
<p>After Chen Yi and others were decided to be transferred to the Army Prison. The third sub-prison on Siqian Street will transfer prisoners awaiting trial, Chen Yi and thirty others, to the Army Second Prison. This matter has attracted the attention of the legal community in Suzhou and Shanghai. It is now learned that this matter occurred because of prison riots in the sub-prison. The Ministry of Justice secretly ordered the High Court to handle the matter and dispatched Wang Yuanhuan, the section chief of the Prison Department, to Suzhou to meet with the President of the High Court, Lin, the Chief Prosecutor, Wang, the Clerk, Wei, and the Deputy Warden to decide to transfer Chen and others.</p>
<p>Men resembling wounded soldiers forcibly pawn old goods. Yesterday (25th) at around 8:00 AM, men resembling wounded soldiers carried cotton quilts to the Fu Yuan pawnshop in Huqiu and Bantang and forcibly pawned them. More and more people gathered, and the pawnshop could not refuse. They closed the door tightly and telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau for instructions on how to maintain commercial influence. The director of the bureau, after receiving the report, had no suitable solution to stop them. Therefore, he convened various agencies at the Railway Hotel outside the city at 6:00 PM to discuss a plan. The results of the discussion are unknown due to time constraints. Whether the pawnshop will open for business today depends on whether a suitable solution can be found.</p>
<p>Bandit robbery and murder at Taiping Bridge. At around 2:00 AM on the morning of the 24th, bandits from Jiangbei broke into the house of Dai Yongxing, a farmer in Wangjiabang, Taiping Bridge, Xiangcheng Township. Armed with sharp weapons, they robbed rice and wheat. Dai Yongxing's wife, Wu, was awakened from her sleep and tried to chop at the bandits with an axe. Unexpectedly, she was wounded in the head by the bandits. The bandits then carried the loot and fled. Dai chased them outside the door, where he was tied up by the bandits and beaten to death with wooden sticks. The local police station heard about the incident and pursued the bandits, but to no avail. They reported to the county yesterday for instructions.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>The third batch of wounded soldiers arrive in Wuxi. Two batches of wounded soldiers, totaling 95, have arrived earlier. Yesterday, at around 12:00 AM, another third batch of 64 wounded soldiers arrived. This morning (25th) at 8:00 AM, another 15 wounded soldiers arrived. The Wuxi Committee for Comforting Wounded Soldiers sent personnel to the station to receive them and hired three boats to transport the wounded soldiers to the No. 22 Rear Hospital in Huishan Town for treatment.</p>
<p>A drama troupe causes trouble and is ordered to stop performing. There are four theaters in Wuxi, including Qing Sheng, Xin Zhongyang, Xin Xin, and Di Yi Tai Zhong Sheng. The Xin Zhongyang Theater is the most prosperous and profitable. The others are not doing well and have been repeatedly closed and reopened. Because of the theaters, accidents have occurred repeatedly. Previously, Xin Zhongyang had a conflict with the audience, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Both parties filed lawsuits, and the county government almost split. After mediation, the lawsuits were dropped. The night before last, Qing Sheng Theater outside Guangfu Gate reported that Inspector Cha Rongqiu (an employee of the Jinghu Railway) had a fight with Liu Hanchao, a waiting officer of the Public Security Bureau. They were taken to the second branch of the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the County Public Security Bureau, which transferred them to the County Government. Yesterday, Officer Yu Chengxiang opened a court hearing. As a result of the interrogation, Liu Hanchao was ordered to return. Cha Rongqiu was sent to the Wuxi Station master for investigation. Liu Hanchao went to the Labor Hospital for treatment and asked someone to petition the County Government for compensation for the damage. County Magistrate Sun Zuji believed that the theater had repeatedly caused incidents, and at this time of unrest, trouble was foreseeable. Yesterday, he specially instructed the Chief of Political Police, Wu Zhengrong, to order the theater to suspend performances from today. Chief Wu followed the order immediately.</p>
<p>All silk factory workers petition. The labor and management of Wuxi silk industry re-negotiated the labor-management contract and formally signed it the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the management suddenly regretted the agreement and firmly refused to sign it, causing the labor-management dispute that was about to be resolved to break down. It is learned that yesterday afternoon, the labor representatives (Silk Factory Workers' Union) specially convened the 19th joint meeting of workers' representatives from various factories. The number of attendees was unusually large. After discussion, two methods were decided: (A) To petition the Party and government organs to resolve the issue fairly, and the workers' representatives from various factories will immediately petition the County Party Headquarters and the County Government. Since the management has reneged on the already resolved solution, the labor will not stop until the goal of implementing the entire draft is achieved. (B) Female workers' representatives from various factories will do their best to dissuade female members to prevent any overstepping of boundaries. After the meeting, they will separately petition the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to request relief, and all workers will go to the County Party Headquarters to petition. Zhang Ren, the executive of the Civil Training Committee, and Ji Jun, the Minister of the Organization Department, received them and promised to resolve the issue reasonably. Then, all the workers went to the County Government to petition. County Magistrate Gu Shi was out on official business, so the second section chief, Lu Qi, received them on his behalf and promised to send personnel to investigate and convene the transforming party to hold a meeting to mediate the conditions already agreed upon by the labor and management, which will definitely be realized and will not disappoint the labor. The workers were satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<p>The patrol team leader dies from serious injuries. Liu Lin, the patrol team leader (i.e., the security regiment) of the Shangtuan branch in Xin'an Town, the fifth district of Wu County, was killed by Xu Fuchun, a soldier who had been dismissed from the team, out of revenge. Another soldier, Wang Yunlong, went to rescue him and was also stabbed. He was sent to Wujin Hospital for treatment. It is learned that patrol team leader Liu Lin died of his injuries at 11:50 PM on the 23rd. On the 24th, Qian Yuzhen, the head of the Shangtuan Headquarters, and Zhang Gongwang, the head of the fifth district, separately sent letters to the County Court and the County Government to report the case. Yang Kong, the chief prosecutor of the County Court, led officials to the scene at 5:00 PM to inspect the body. The examination revealed 18 or 19 knife wounds on the body, the most serious of which was in the abdomen. The stabbed soldier, Wang Yunlong, was also examined and found to have five or six stab wounds. The prosecutor briefly questioned the family of the deceased and then prepared a coffin for burial. The murderer, Xu Fuchun, is still being actively pursued.</p>
<p>A boat on its way to Jiting Bridge is robbed. A boat sailing from Wu County to Jiting Bridge was robbed at about 1:00 AM on the 24th while passing through the Shiwudong Bridge area in Yan Township. The boatmen were tied up and beaten, and the boat was searched for about an hour before the robbers left. It is estimated that they stole over two hundred yuan in cash and three gold rings. Fortunately, hundreds of yuan in paper money were not stolen.</p>
<p>Finance Department committee member goes from Changzhou to Wuxi. Zhuang Yeguang, a committee member of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, was ordered to come to Changzhou to guard and collect 20,000 yuan in allotted silver. On the 24th, he contacted County Magistrate Wu and Liu Hongzhao, the director of the Finance Bureau, regarding everything. Director Liu promised to find a way to raise the money. Committee member Zhuang had to go to Wuxi and Yixing counties to guard and collect allotted funds, so he immediately took a car to Wuxi.</p>

Yu Chaoting, the supervising officer of the 20th detachment of the Water Public Security Team, seized a large amount of opium, totaling 55 large packages weighing several thousand taels, near Huangshan Port on the 23rd. Captain He telegraphed Jiang Chao, the district chief of Zhenjiang, to send the Daya warship to Cheng to pick it up within days.</p>
<p>Due to local economic difficulties, the director resigns. Cheng County is busy with tax collection, but due to the poor harvest this year, tax revenue has decreased. Since the reform, the number of local organs has increased significantly. For example, the monthly police expenses have increased from 1,050 yuan to over 5,000 yuan. The Funds Production Office cannot raise funds. Since March and April, arrears have accumulated. From last year to now, it owes more than 100,000 yuan to various money houses. The debt is high and there is no more borrowing. The current director and deputy director of the Funds Production Office, Xia Sunhu and Zhu Fei, cannot cope and have firmly resigned to the County Government.</p>
<p>Panic over skyrocketing rice prices. Since the fall of silver prices, the prices of all goods have soared, and rice prices have also skyrocketed. In recent days, it has reached 20 yuan. On the 23rd, it was sold for 19.2 yuan, and unofficially at 20 yuan. The public is in a state of panic. Because rice merchants have no goods arriving, they restrict rice buyers to only a few dou. Under these circumstances, the livelihood of the common people is truly unbearable. The Warehouse Committee has put forward seven opinions to County Magistrate Li, as follows: (1) The Funds Production Office should automatically offer to pledge and deposit grain funds in various estates and Changhua, and all should be transferred. (2) The grain funds are only over 20,000 yuan. If they are distributed to various villages for price stabilization, it will not help. Efforts should be made to raise large amounts of funds for simultaneous distribution. (3) In recent years, the Funds Production Office has used the custody of grain funds to divert funds for party affairs and various local expenses, amounting to tens of thousands. All should be ordered to return the funds. (4) Impartial personnel should be recommended to persuade local and overseas merchants to donate funds. (5) Has the funds accumulated before 1922 been distributed to various villages to stabilize prices or distributed to poor households, and have records been reported and announced? Please send personnel to investigate. (6) Whether the price stabilization should be organized by the entire county or distributed to various villages and districts for separate fund-raising, a sound method should be studied and implemented. (7) The Grain Funds used by the former Military and Police Joint Defense Office and the Public Security Team established during the Qing Township period, amounting to tens of thousands, should be returned to the Grain Funds Office. Measures to deal with local prostitutes. Because there are many local prostitutes in the county, the county government will discuss emergency measures for dealing with arrested local prostitutes at the three-day county government meeting. It was resolved that after the first arrest, the Public Security Bureau will take photos and display them to the public, and order a guarantor to hand them over to their families for custody. The second time, they will be expelled from the county along with their families and sent to the local rehabilitation center for custody after it is established. Provincial Party Headquarters investigates the accusation. Gao Kangfu, a member of the organizing committee of the County Party Headquarters, was accused by Party member Zhu and others to the Provincial Party Headquarters, which sent Wang Zhichao on the 23rd to Cheng to investigate.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Jiangsu Products Exhibition Hall to open soon. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining previously ordered all counties to select and manufacture the latest products or draw and frame the research results and send them to the department for review and exhibition before the opening of the Agricultural and Mining Products Exhibition Hall. Now, the factory believes that the deadline is approaching, but not many factories have complied. In addition to sending personnel to work with Qi Lunji and Hou Zhenfeng, the directors of the exhibition hall, to sort out all the agricultural and mining products that have been sent, and ordering the Forestry Bureau to send personnel to assist in sorting out the forestry products, it also issued an order yesterday urging all counties to quickly comply with the previous order to select and manufacture various specimens and send them to the province for review and exhibition in order to open as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Telegraphs to request exemption from sending wounded soldiers to Yangzhou. The County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Wounded Soldiers Rear Management Committee on the 23rd, stating that since the military uprising in 1927, Jiangdu has been a key point in northern Jiangsu, so that the rebel army's southward invasion and the national army's northward expedition have all regarded it as a necessary route. In total, there have been more than ten times of military disasters, resulting in losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan. The local vitality has been greatly damaged, and business has been depressed. So far, the debt is so large that it cannot be compensated. In addition, in the past two years, banditry has been rampant and disasters have been frequent, and the people are in dire straits. In June of this year, the Jiangdu County Government was approved to forward the telegram from the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs ordering them to seek places to accommodate wounded soldiers. The county government telegraphed back based on the meeting situation on file. Yesterday, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs continued to reply, stating that if wounded soldiers arrive, it is hoped that they will strive to prepare for supplies and treatment. The county government forwarded the information again. It is reported that the local Jiang area is in distress as described above. If wounded soldiers are sent to Yangzhou again, ordering them to prepare supplies and treatment is actually a painful situation where they cannot win. Please consider and approve the request to exempt sending wounded soldiers to Yangzhou. We are extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Headquarters to be established in Northern Jiangsu. Liu Zuhan, the guerrilla commander of Northern Jiangsu, dispatched his staff officer, Hua Jun, and adjutant, Shen Song, to Yangzhou to select a location for the headquarters. Hua and others went to the Chamber of Commerce on the 23rd to state their intentions, saying that they had found a suitable house in the back of He Garden and were arranging it. Once they reported back, they would work with Liu in Yangzhou.</p>
<p>Boatmen come to the city to complain. The boatmen in Sanyi River were found to have wheat by Xia, the police captain stationed there. Six boatmen, including Yu Da, Ni, and Liu Yutai, were detained and taken to the city. Yesterday, the police brigade transferred them to the court. This morning (24th), more than a dozen family members of the boatmen came to the city and went to the County Government Police Team and the County Court to complain, claiming that Captain Xia had arbitrarily arrested the common people and used torture to extract confessions, requesting justice. It is still unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<p>Jingjiang</p>
<p>The Security Regiment intercepts a bandit ship. The Security Regiment of the Eighth District received a tip on the morning of the 21st that a bandit ship was moored in Dajue Port, about three miles away from Sidunzi. There were more than 40 bandits on board with box guns. Regiment Commander Li led his team to suppress the bandits. The bandits heard the news and fled across the river.

Also, a young girl, the sister of the wife, was kidnapped by the bandits. Before leaving, the bandits fired guns to show off.</p>

The rest were temporarily detained and could be released if there was reliable guarantee.</p>
<p>Gaoyou</p>
<p>Hall order to restore business in Xingye. All shops in the county have suspended business since 1927 due to military influence. The Civil Hall has now issued a special order to the County Government, stating that the county has suffered a poor harvest and the poor have no access to loans, making life difficult. Remedial measures must be taken. The local pawn industry should be ordered to continue operating as appropriate to provide some relief. All loans that have expired or have not expired should be extended for three months, and interest should be calculated according to the regulations. County Magistrate Wang has ordered all pawnshops to comply. The young nephew of Wang is kidnapped. The young nephew of Wang Chunbo, a farmer in Weiwangzhuang, has been kidnapped by bandits since last winter and there has been no news of him. Wang learned of his whereabouts the day before yesterday and heard that he had been contacted by a certain village official and would be redeemed for 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>The District Chief is accused and thoroughly investigated. Zhang Shiyan, the District Chief of the Second District of Gaoyou, has been accused by Zhou and other citizens of the district in the Civil Hall of prostituting, gambling, and abusing his power. County Magistrate Wang received an order from the Hall yesterday and commissioned Guo Shixi, the District Chief of the First District, and Wan Diankui, the District Chief of the Fifth District, to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Accounting Director transferred to Bureau Chief. Zhou Sixai, the accounting director of the Gaoyou Finance Bureau, has been appointed by the Finance Hall as the director of the Jingjiang County Finance Bureau. It is heard that Zhou has left for his new post this morning (21st).</p>
<p>Jiashan</p>
<p>Bandits rob rice in Gan Kiln. Rice prices have been rising day by day, with Dongshuang costing 18.4 yuan per dan. Those who seek a living feel it is difficult to eat. Last night, dozens of poor people and bandits came to Qianjiabang, Gan Kiln, and robbed rice from house to house. Even those with three or five liters of rice for the next day were not spared. The public is extremely panicked. If rice prices are not suppressed, the robbery may be difficult to stop. Two cases of kidnapping and robbery in Hongyang Port. Yesterday, four bandit ships and 40 bandits from the northeast of Jiashan Dingzha came to Hongyang Port. After landing, they rushed to the home of farmer Gu Sanqing and demanded 1,000 yuan in silver, but they were unsuccessful. They ransacked the boxes and cabinets at will, losing nearly 100 yuan. Seeing that there was nothing else of value, they kidnapped Gu's younger brother, Long Shengzi Amaotou, and threatened to redeem him for 2,000 yuan. Then they went to the house of Hu Atao in Waihan, robbed it clean, shot three workers, and lost about 400 yuan and more than 60 shi of white rice. After the robbery, they left.</p>

<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Anti-bandit measures on the coast of Nantong. Recently, sea bandits have frequently invaded the coastal areas of Nantong, forcing fishermen to pay protection money and hijacking merchant ships. Residents of Luken, Pengjiao, and other areas have all organized fishermen's groups to cooperate with the garrison troops to defend the coast. Blockhouses are built at strategic locations and military telephones are installed. The Fan Gong Dike is being rebuilt into a motor road, and construction will begin in the autumn. The Security Regiment temporarily uses a recruitment system. The Nantong County Government believes that the organization of the Security Regiment should legally convene district residents to serve as soldiers. However, the banditry in the four villages is very strong and it is difficult to carry out. County Magistrate Zhang has specially approved the province to organize and establish Security Regiments in all districts. Temporary recruitment of temporary soldiers will be allowed. It will be renamed the Temporary Security Regiment. Once the banditry is quelled, the Security District Regiment will be reorganized in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>Survey of the tidal disasters along the Yangtze River. The Nantong Yao and Wang ports have been hit by tidal disasters. In recent days, the farmland of Zhang Zongwei and Bai Jiawei has been collapsing rapidly. The collapse of Langshan is imminent. On the 24th, County Magistrate Zhang, Director Yao of the Construction Bureau, and representatives from all walks of life went to the disaster area to investigate. In addition to telegraphing the province for relief, they are rushing to allocate funds for rescue work.</p>
<p>Rugao</p>
<p>The Zhou Dingbo case, Chief of the Public Security Bureau of Motou, was sentenced. Zhou Dingbo, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of Motou, was accused by Chen Ziyan to the Rugao County Government of defrauding money. After the evidence was confirmed, he was imprisoned pending sentencing. It is learned that yesterday, Zhou Dingbo was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The Liu Changyan case. It has recently been heard that Liu Changyan, the former County Magistrate of the county, has been repeatedly accused. The Provincial Government has decided to send the various cases of Liu Changyan's illegality to the court for trial. It is learned that the Provincial Government has designated the Jiangning Local Court to investigate. The court recently requested the County Government to obtain the files. The County Government has sent the files of the Zhang Zhaofeng case, the Jiang Houzai case, and the Geng Jinzhi case to the court for review today (22nd).</p>
<p>Pinghu</p>
<p>Lu Lansheng's house was robbed. The house of Lu Lansheng, a carpenter in Xiaoniangbang, Northwest Village, Jiudai, Xindai, was suddenly attacked by bandits at late night on the 23rd. More than a dozen bandits with thread guns and machetes broke into the door and pointed at the owner, forcing him to show them where the silver was hidden, injuring the owner with knives and robbing him of 100 yuan and cloth clothes. The next day, the owner reported to the Public Security Bureau and requested an arrest.</p>
<p>A monk drowned while bathing. Three monks in Baoben Temple bathed in the river in front of the temple yesterday, the 24th, because it was hot. When they went ashore, one monk was missing. Because the river was quite deep and the monk could not swim, he drowned.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry begins preparations. The Zhejiang Provincial Government meeting has approved the proposal to establish the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and appointed Qian Tianhe, the current member of the Central Agricultural Extension Council, as the director. Qian received the order from the hall yesterday and began preparations. However, the budget of the department is still being reduced.</p>
<p>Investigate the amount of cash and silver. The Zhejiang Finance Hall has received an order from the ministry to investigate the amount of cash and silver in the province and estimate the price increases and decreases in the past year. It will send a letter to the Construction Hall to discuss the method in the coming days.</p>
<p>Arrested key criminals involved in counterfeiting national currency. Sun Yu, the captain of the Eighth Camp and Second Team of the Liangzhe Anti-Smuggling Bureau, reported to the bureau that he had arrested Dai Xiaolan, a key criminal involved in counterfeiting national currency, and the coin-making equipment and counterfeit coins in the Fenglin Nunnery at the foot of Xiawan Mountain. He sent them to the court for punishment according to law.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>Robbery on the road in broad daylight. A local villager surnamed Zheng, who was selling fruits such as peaches and plums near Suoqian Town, was robbed by four bandits while walking to Xihuitou Chi Tou Shen. They robbed him of 19 yuan and 27 jiao in cash and pushed Zheng into the mud.</p>
<p>The County Government conducts a census in Jin County. The townships and towns of Xiaoshan have already established and organized the County Government to conduct a census of the entire county. Yesterday, a special order was issued to each district office to submit a census table of the population in the district to the county for review and compilation of the county census table.</p>
<p>The amount of bayberry shipped out. Bayberry is a specialty of Xiaoshan. This year, the fruit production is unusually abundant. Since it was launched on the market on the 13th of this month, more than 45,000 units have been shipped out by railway, worth about 500,000 yuan. There are still three or four tenths of the fruit waiting to be transported from various mountains. This is also good news for agricultural production.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan</p>
<p>The Sanjiangkou robbery and injury case. There are usually three or four small grocery stores near Sanjiangkou, opposite Linpu. At about 10:00 PM on the 19th, six or seven bandits with foreign accents suddenly came to the Chengda Grocery Store, broke in through the screen door, and robbed them openly with torches and clubs. The hostess, Tian Shen, was awakened from her dream and shouted for help, causing her to be injured in the leg by the bandits. Fortunately, it was not fatal. Later, merchant ships from Hangzhou and Zhuji arrived, and the bandits fled. After checking, it was found that they had been robbed of more than 100 yuan in silver and clothes.</p>
<p>Illegal village and town chiefs are accused. Since the establishment of village and town councils in Xiaoshan, most of the village and town chiefs have been upright in their conduct, but there are also many who act arbitrarily and extort money. For example, Xu Bingkui, the chief of Xuanheng Village, used the stamp to extort three yuan in silver, and Xu Yisheng, the chief of Wu Tu Village, privately charged two jiao per mu for reporting fees, and also forbade the management and purchase of ponds and marshes. As a result, the people were resentful, and it is no wonder that people often sue the county and the province.</p>
<p>Shangyu</p>
<p>The entanglement over the suspension of Chunhui School. The school board of Chunhui Middle School suspended the school due to the kidnapping case, causing more than 400 students to be at a loss. The people of the county did not approve of this, believing that the kidnapping case and the school were two separate matters. It is necessary to rescue the principals who were kidnapped, but the school cannot be suspended because of the kidnapping case with the eight characters "protecting no one and unable to defend themselves." Moreover, the school receives a subsidy of 2,000 yuan from the province every year, so it is not appropriate to suspend classes and allow the students to waste their studies. Moreover, the school was funded by the late school president Chen 　　Lan and Chen Ziqiu Shan, founded by Jing Hengyi, and Fan Shoukang has been in charge for ten years. Recently, the library has been enriched, the sports field has been built, and the new school buildings have been expanded with a new atmosphere. Its perfect equipment is the crown of the current private middle schools. After this incident, the school authorities only made one meeting to suspend classes, and no one was responsible for the end of the school year and the relief of students who lost their school, which is very regrettable. It is also known that Chunzhong students established the School Protection Movement Committee on the 19th. Regarding the fact that the bandits can come and go freely in the areas where the military and police are stationed and wander during the day and kidnap and cause bloodshed at night, it is due to the dereliction of duty of the military and police and for the sake of their own future, they cannot sit idly by and issue a statement to schools, institutions, and organizations across the country requesting sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>Shi Huaimao is sentenced to death again. Shi Huaimao of Nijiapu was sentenced to two death sentences and two prison terms totaling 15 years and 4 months, and deprived of his civil rights for life by the county's retrial on December 30 of the same year for the case of adultery, injury, and poisoning Zhang Depei and his wife, and poisoning Zhang Guixian unsuccessfully in October 1928. Shi refused to accept the appeal and appealed to the Supreme Court, which revoked the original judgment and remanded it to the High Court for retrial. Earlier this month, the High Court retried and sentenced Shi Huaimao to death again. It is heard that he will be sent back to his place of origin for execution in the coming days.</p>
<p>Jiangshan</p>
<p>Jiangshan County is strictly guarding against bandits and communists. Jiangshan is an important place in eastern Zhejiang and the throat of Fujian entering Zhejiang. The defense is extremely important. Recently, the Guangfeng County Police Team in Jiangxi Province colluded with bandits and communists to occupy the county seat in the cold night, killing officials and releasing prisoners. The momentum was huge. Guangcheng is only 50 miles away from Jiangshan. It is now heard that the bandits have gathered in the 42nd capital, which is even closer, and there is a sense of imminent danger. Because of the emergency, County Magistrate Mi repeatedly telegraphed the province to send elite troops to suppress them, and personally supervised the military and police day and night to strictly guard and check travelers and hotels to prevent bandit spies from infiltrating. He also sent a team to the border to strengthen the defense. Also, because the county had previously uncovered the case of Guan Zengshou, who smuggled guns, and Guan was a member of the Guangfeng Police Team, which was obviously related to this rebellion, it is heard that he has sent cadres overnight to send the prisoners to Jinhua to avoid negligence. However, the garrison troops are limited. It is deeply hoped that the province will transfer heavy troops to strengthen the defense as soon as possible to avoid tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Liaoning Official Mines Decide to Seek Merchants for Exploitation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The mining areas in Liaoning Province are abundant, several times that of the entire country. The former Industry Department presented to the former Provincial Governor's Office to retain over 160 locations for official operation, but they have not been developed. It is a great pity to waste these resources. Now, the Department of Agriculture and Mines has carefully planned and decided to tender for the exploitation of the remaining 160+ mining areas, except for a few that will be operated by the government itself, in order to develop the resources. Eleven articles of provisional regulations for opening official mines and unexploited mines, ten articles of inspection rules, and fourteen articles of simplified regulations for collecting proceeds from mineral sales have been formulated. These have been submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval and will be promulgated and implemented by the Department. The following is a transcript of the opening regulations: (Article 1) All official and unexploited mines in the province, except for those that are selectively retained (the number of retained mines will be determined by the Department), will be tendered for exploitation. The exploitation methods will be handled in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise stipulated by law. (Article 2) When merchants apply for these mining areas, they must still comply with the procedures outlined in the Mining Law. However, the area of application must be surveyed by a special commissioner sent by the Department, who will provide a map and explanation. The merchant must submit five copies of the map for separate filing. (Article 3) The amount of capital required for exploitation will be determined by the Department based on the size of the planned mine and the number of acres. The funds must be deposited in cash in a reliable bank or merchant house. A receipt will be issued first, and the funds can only be withdrawn when the mining license is issued, in order to prevent delays in exploitation. The number of capital to be prepared by ordinary mine merchants, which was previously approved by the Department for revision, does not apply to these regulations. (Article 4) Merchants applying to exploit official mines will have a preparation period of three months from the date of issuance of the mining license and an implementation period of six months for exploitation. If the deadline is exceeded, the mining rights will be revoked. If there are special circumstances requiring an extension, it must not exceed the provisions of Article 46 of the Mining Law (failure to start work after registration or suspension of work for more than one year). (Article 5) During the preparation period, an office must be established within the first month or a company must be organized in accordance with the Company Law. (Article 6) In order to supervise and guide the implementation of mining plans and the progress of affairs, the Department may assign an inspector to each mining area based on its size. The miner is responsible for the monthly salary, but the amount will be determined by the Department separately. The aforementioned inspector will be dispatched when the mine is being prepared, and the rules of operation will be determined by the Department separately. (Article 7) For each mine extracted from an officially reserved mine, the merchant is to calculate, at the end of each month, the total proceeds sold at market price. The Department will collect 2% to 4% as appropriate. The aforementioned collection method and amount may be determined by the Department on an ad hoc basis. (Article 8) Merchants who apply to mine officially reserved mines are allowed to present the amount of ore extracted, or the amount tested, if there is no exploitative value. The Department may waive or audit the seventh regulation to see if it applies. (Article 9) The term for applying to open mines officially reserved with gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and coal is from 25 to 35 years. For clay, talc, gypsum, and zinc, the term is from 20 to 30 years. After the term expires, the miner is allowed to continue mining. However, if the miner has special circumstances and cannot continue mining, and the Department recruits a third party to mine, the real estate and buildings in the mining area must be received by the Department and paid with a corresponding value of gold. The provisions of the preceding article do not apply to those who suspend work midway. (Article 10) If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, the Department of Agriculture and Mines may amend them at any time and submit them to the Provincial Government for record. (Article 11) These regulations shall come into effect from the date of deliberation and promulgation by the Provincial Government Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Liaoning Province Plans to Establish a Match Monopoly Bureau <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Zhenyi, Director of the Department of Finance, believes that matches are a daily necessity. The match merchants in the province are only Guandong, Huilin, Sanming, and Sheng Sheng, four companies whose business is relatively developed and sales are quite extensive. However, recently there have been unscrupulous merchants counterfeiting brands and selling at inconsistent prices, which has greatly affected the match industry. Moreover, domestic matches have been under pressure from Swedish matches for years and have been unable to resist. In order to develop national interests and revitalize Dong Province's industry, the Department plans to establish a Match Monopoly Bureau to purchase and sell all domestic matches through the Bureau. Merchants are not allowed to set up factories for manufacturing without permission. Imports are also purchased by the Bureau in order to protect profits. The organizational charter of the Match Monopoly Bureau has been drafted and submitted to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee. It will be formally established once approved. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Perilous State of Industry and Commerce in Jilin <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Appeal to the Provincial Government for Relief</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: The industry and commerce in the provincial capital are under the pressure of gold notes and are struggling to survive. In total, the member firms of the two industry and commerce associations owe Japanese-owned Manchuria Bank and Jilin Bank no less than 600,000 yuan in gold notes. Compared to the past, it has risen by more than one time, causing even greater damage. Not only is the market bleak, but there is also a complete stagnation. Previously, the leaders of each industry appealed to the two commerce and industry associations to plead with the provincial government to order the banks in the provincial capital to provide sufficient loans to alleviate the immediate crisis. The provincial government believes that whether the banks can provide loans as much as possible is another issue, and the standards and limits for loans requested by the industry and commerce sectors, as well as all methods of mortgage guarantees, must be thoroughly examined and pre-defined. Therefore, the government ordered the two associations to draft six articles of measures: (1) In order to avoid the soaring of Japanese gold, causing disaster. All industry and commerce firms in the provincial capital with lending relationships with foreign banks, or those without foreign lending but with legitimate needs, should request domestic banks to provide sufficient loans for relief. (2) The form of industry and commerce firm lending has always been divided into two types: mortgage loans and credit loans. For this request for relief, what kind of procedures are appropriate for the industry and commerce firms receiving loans? It is proposed that the lending banks and the borrowing industry and commerce firms negotiate on their own. (3) Whether the pledges or credit guarantees prepared by the borrowing industry and commerce firms are accurate should be thoroughly investigated by the lending banks. If necessary, the industry and commerce associations will assist in the handling. (4) The interest rate on foreign bank loans ranges from a minimum of 8% to a maximum of 1% and 1.4%. This request for relief also asks that the interest rates set by the banks be specially reduced with reference to this interest rate. (5) The lending of funds by the banks is often difficult for the borrower to repay on time due to the short term. This request for relief is to maintain the market, resist foreign economic invasion, and save interests. It is proposed that the banks extend the term exceptionally to serve as an example. (6) The above measures are based on the lending rules of the banks, each with its own regulations. However, due to repeated provincial orders, they have been jointly reviewed to determine whether they are appropriate. The provincial government believes that the current rise in gold notes and the panic in the market must be maintained by some means. However, the lending of funds by the banks, although no more than two types of mortgages and credit, must have a certain and unchangeable process. The two layers of requested reduction of interest rates and extension of terms, whether they can be done, are still to be negotiated. The actual number of industry and commerce sectors in the provincial capital that are currently under the pressure of gold notes, and whether they can be rescued based on their recent business conditions, and how to classify and determine the loan amount, must also be carefully considered. The government ordered the competent Department of Agriculture and Mines to investigate and invite the banks to discuss and reply. The Department also found it difficult and first invited the two industry and commerce associations to negotiate. Yan Aichen, Vice President of the Chamber of Commerce, and Hu Weiqing, President of the Industrial Association, both arrived at the Department for discussion. Subsequently, it was agreed that the first step would be for the two associations to investigate the number of industry and commerce firms that need loans and negotiate the loan procedures with the banking group. After the loan procedures are ready, the second step will be for the Department to convene a joint meeting of all relevant parties to decide on measures to be submitted to the province for implementation. The two associations are currently starting the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Suspension of the Jiangsu Province Cooperation Training Institute <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The provincial treasury can eliminate burdens.</p>
<p>The cause will not be interrupted.</p>
<p>In order to promote cooperation and improve the economy of farmers, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines established the Cooperative Instructor Training Institute in the 17th year, and in the 18th year, it established eight provincial instructor offices in various counties, and continued to run the second phase of the Cooperative Instructor Training Institute. It was planning to expand the plan and proceed by region, but due to the provincial treasury deficit, it had to tighten up, and the original instructor offices established with provincial funds had to be cut down to save money. However, at a time when the central government is actively promoting cooperation, it seems difficult to stop the cooperative cause that has already been established in Jiangsu Province halfway. Therefore, the Department of Agriculture has formulated an economic measure, that is, to reassign the graduates of the first and second phases to work in various counties under the command and supervision of the county government. All counties that have already approved the collection of two-point agricultural improvement mu donations will pay the cooperative expenses and the salaries of the instructors from special funds.

<h3 id="e18">Procedures for Private Universities to Submit Documents to the Ministry <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Circular Transmitted by Provincial and Municipal Departments and Bureaus</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously received a request from the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau to order all private universities to submit documents to the Ministry through their local departments and bureaus. The Ministry considered the request to be essential and yesterday ordered all provincial and municipal departments and bureaus to transmit it to their subordinate private schools for compliance. The original order is transcribed below: According to the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau's report, Article 21 of the Regulations for Private Schools stipulates that the establishment of a private school should be submitted by the competent Education Department or Special City Education Bureau to the Ministry of Education for transmission. The transmission should include a detailed investigation and comments for review. According to the terms of the article, the competent department and the detailed investigation and comments during transmission mean that private universities are also subject to the management of the local departments and bureaus. Since the establishment documents are transmitted by the competent department, other documents should also be handled in the same way. Recently, private universities have often directly submitted reports or requests to the Ministry, which not only violates the regulations but also makes it difficult for the competent departments and bureaus to understand the school's operation status. There is a sense of isolation in matters such as guidance for further education and guidance for visits. When the Director attended the National Education Conference in Beijing, he personally reported to the Minister, who approved that all documents submitted to the Ministry by private universities and all documents given to private universities by the Ministry should be transmitted by the departments and bureaus for examination. It is requested that all private universities be ordered to comply. According to the previous situation, Article 1910 of the Ministry's decree in the 18th year has stipulated that the board of directors of private vocational schools or specialized schools that have been established should report the items listed in Article 13 of the Regulations for Private Schools to the provincial and municipal education administrative agencies for periodic reporting. According to the previous situation, the investigation is essential. In the future, all private vocational schools or specialized schools that have been established or are in the process of closure should submit or request the Ministry for review, except for urgent matters that cannot wait for transmission, or request for tax-free passports and study abroad certificates that are not related to educational administration. All matters should be transmitted by the local provincial and municipal education administrative agencies to avoid isolation and facilitate examination. In addition to the order, the department is ordered to comply and transmit it to all established private vocational schools or specialized schools under its jurisdiction for compliance. This order.</p>

The items listed in the table of local academic organizations submitted by those who have submitted are not fully consistent with the Regulations for Education Administrative Agencies to Manage Academic Organizations previously issued by the Ministry, which is insufficient for statistics. In the future, regardless of whether it has been reported or not, all academic organizations within the jurisdiction should be transferred in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the aforementioned Regulations ((3) The establishment of an academic organization must be initiated by the initiators who draft the regulations and submit them to the provincial or special municipal education administrative agency for approval.

<p>According to the China Library Association, it submitted articles prepared in accordance with the resolution of the first annual meeting in January of the eighteenth year, requesting adoption and implementation. After investigation, the library business is an urgent matter for educational construction. Now that various places have successively established this special talent, there is an increasing sense of lack. The association's statement that it attaches importance to library professionals is not without merit. In addition to the separate instructions and orders, a copy of the original presentation and the original approval are sent to the school, requesting that it add library science courses or a library science department within the Department of Literature or the Department of Education, so as to cultivate this special talent for application.</p>

<p>Guangdong Education Department's Summer Education Administration Outline</p>
<p>(4) Yi Lu</p>
<p>7. (Education Statistics) A. Compile education statistics for the 17th year; B. Compile secondary education statistics for the first period of the 18th year. In terms of administration, education statistics are the standard for all facilities and plans. In terms of academics, they are the basis for studying the rise and fall of education. However, the concept of statistics is weak in various counties and cities, and statistics are regarded as unimportant. Therefore, the department's letters urging the reporting of statistics are no less than repeated orders and requests, but those who urge still urge, and those who do not report still do not report. The reason is that local soldiers and bandits have lost their files, and bandits are rampant and difficult to investigate. Others say that they have no economic resources and it is difficult to fill out the report. Among the above reasons, some are true, but those who do not understand the meaning of statistics and lack statistical talents take the opportunity to delay. The department plans to compile education statistics for the 17th year and education statistics for the first semester of the 18th year in order. If the counties and cities still ignore them, in addition to submitting a special case to the provincial government for the promulgation of disciplinary measures, it is planned to compile them using [partial] analysis methods according to the nature of schools at all levels in order to complete them as scheduled.</p>
<p>8. (Others) A. Continue to send inspectors to set off. Inspectors will still be divided into seven districts and dispatched in accordance with the previous method. The focus of this period is on qualitative improvement and using sufficient time to direct provincial schools. B. Compile Guangdong's current education laws and regulations. It has been included in the plan for the previous period, and it is now planned to urge its speedy compilation for reference and examination. C. Compile a summary of provincial schools. It has been included in the plan for the previous period, and it is now planned to urge its speedy compilation for reference and examination. D. Improve and ban student hostels throughout the province. The regulations for banning student hostels and the regulations for registering student hostels were formulated and promulgated by former Director Huang, but they have not been effectively implemented. As for former Director Xu, the department formulated various implementation measures and handed them over to the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau to be responsible for handling them without success. The purpose of banning student hostels is to protect students living outside the school and general youths to prevent them from being infected with bad habits. However, banning student hostels from a negative perspective is laborious and ineffective. It is now planned to start from a positive perspective and convene the training directors of secondary and higher schools to discuss the management of students living outside the school, and then revise the various chapters and regulations for banning student hostels in order to make them practical. E. Compile the school calendar for the 19th year. Now that the Ministry of Education has issued an order to revise the regulations on the school year, semester, and holidays of schools, we should immediately comply with the provisions of Article 10, Paragraph 1 of the regulations and compile and publish the school calendars of primary and secondary schools in the 19th year separately. The provincial industrial college and private specialized schools above the specialized level have compiled the school calendar for the 19th year for schools above the specialized level and sent two copies to the department before April 20 for submission to the Ministry of Education for record. F. Improve school physical education. School physical education should pay attention to the average development of the body and mind of all students, strengthen physical fitness, be lively in spirit, and cultivate habits of observing discipline and harmony. Therefore, the types of sports should be in line with this purpose in order to promote physical education. After investigating the schools in the province, although they can do their best to promote physical education, they mostly focus on cultivating competitive athletes and ignore ordinary exercises. Not only does this violate the original intention of school physical education, but also the efficiency of sports will be reduced. We should find ways to improve it in order to improve national health. It is planned to formulate other measures during this period to ensure that all students can receive ordinary exercises in order to improve the efficiency of physical education.</p>
<p>9. (Research on New Education) A. The Provincial First Normal School, the First Middle School, and the Girls' Normal School are designated as experimental schools. The administrative plan for the pre-service period has been reported and should continue to be tested and assessed. B. Experimental Field for Dynamic Education. The Experimental Field for Dynamic Education, which was established by former Director Xu, has been reported in the administrative plan and should continue to be tested and assessed. C. Research on Provisional Standards for the Curriculum. The Ministry of Education ordered former Director Xu to establish a meeting for research and should continue to urge its progress and report the results of the research to the Ministry of Education for inspection and approval as scheduled.

<p>To be held in Shenyang in mid-August</p>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineers believes that Northeast China has a vast area and abundant resources. If engineering construction is not promoted, it will be difficult to achieve perfection. Moreover, the three provinces are adjacent to strong neighbors and the situation is important. There are many factories and buildings invested in by foreigners, and there is much to learn from and explore. Therefore, the 13th annual meeting of the institute has been decided to be held in Shenyang in mid-August. The wheel of preferential treatment is also handled separately as usual. It is reported that the chairman of this annual meeting has been appointed as Mr. Zhang Runtian, the chairman of the Shenyang branch, to actively prepare and carry out various contact matters. In addition to the general office of the institute at No. 7 Ningbo Road, Shanghai, you can also directly contact Mr. Zhang Runtian, the chief engineer of the Shenyang Beining Railway Port Affairs Office. In addition to the routine meeting process, this annual meeting will also discuss the merger with the Chinese Institute of Engineers, which is very important to the engineering community in China.</p>

<p>Joint Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Secondary Schools held a joint ceremony yesterday, hosted by the Municipal Education Bureau. Because the schools are located in different places and there is no auditorium, the ceremony was held in two places, the Penglai Theater in Nanshi and the Central Auditorium in Beishi. The ceremony in Nanshi was held from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, with the participation of more than 20 schools and more than 1,000 people. The ceremony in Beishi was held from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, with the participation of more than 40 schools and more than 1,000 people. Director Chen, the chairman, performed the ceremony as scheduled.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Today is the first joint graduation ceremony of secondary schools in Shanghai. The main reasons for holding the joint ceremony are: (1) to avoid the tediousness of holding separate ceremonies (2) to enable graduates to develop group training (3) to enable graduates to have a more profound impression. This graduation ceremony is not only a grand joint event, but also more honored after the examination. The reason why the Education Bureau has the examination is also briefly described. Examination is a good system that has existed in our country since ancient times. Unfortunately, it was used by emperors to confine the tools of bookworms, which led to the burying of talents and the decline of morale. In principle, it also praises the examination, so it is listed as one of the civil rights. We have found abuses in past school exams. On the student side, they usually study hard, but when it comes to exams, they only know to ask the teacher for the scope. On the teacher side, in order to maintain personal achievements and reputation, they also give students hints in advance. This is not only a great concern for culture, but also a guide to the destruction of the nation. If we want to remedy and correct it, there is no other way than the examination. This is the beginning of our country and the time is short, so there are many shortcomings. We only seek to progress gradually and achieve perfection. Before the examination, there were supporters and opponents. We only have to overcome all difficulties and carry it out. Therefore, those who participate in the ceremony today feel more happy, and I think the students feel the same. After graduation, the paths are mostly to further education and employment. I would like to offer some humble opinions to you. Those of you who are going to work, society is a high-temperature melting pot, and Shanghai is even more so. You should be wary. In school, mistakes can be forgiven. In society, if there is any impropriety, criticism and scolding will follow. The best way to deal with society is to be patient. Be patient with all difficulties. What everyone should pay attention to is that there are always good opportunities in society. Do not miss them. However, difficulties come with opportunities. You still need to work hard to achieve success. Those of you who are going to further education, do you know how precious and difficult it is to be able to further education today? Not to mention those who cannot study today, there are many blind people who do not know how to read. There are even more people who have no food, no clothes, and no shelter. You can finish middle school and go on to further education. How should you encourage yourself so that you can be worthy of yourself, your family, and the country? The country spends huge sums of money on education to create good talents for the country. You should always realize that the country, society, and all people without clothes, food, and shelter have high expectations for you. You must work hard to live up to their expectations. Hard work is sincerity. I dare say that those who can be sincere in their studies will surely succeed. There is also something to tell you. The worst phenomenon in society today is the development of personal desires without regard for group discipline. Therefore, the bad academic style has reached its peak. Those who further their education should correct their mistakes in the future, and those who are employed must always respect group discipline and restrain personal desires. The future of the nation will have new hope. After the speech, Xu Peihuang, the representative of the mayor, issued graduation certificates and the director issued certificates of merit.</p>
<p>Mayor's Representative's Address</p>
<p>The mayor could not come due to business and asked me to represent him in participating in the joint graduation ceremony. Your results on this examination are very good and commendable. The two words "seeking knowledge" are not easy to say at present. Shanghai has a population of 3 million, which is about 30,000 households based on 10 people per household. If there is one middle school student in every 10 households, there should be 30,000 people. Now there are only 3,000 people, which is only one in a thousand. Your opportunities can be said to be very good, but your responsibilities are also very heavy. The chairman has already spoken about the bad academic style. No country in the world is like China, which is a shame for our country. Those who further their education should encourage themselves. The responsibilities of those who are employed are even more important than those who further their education. In Shanghai, one middle school student in a thousand people represents a thousand people. European and American education is also based on middle school, so middle school students are the basic organization of the country. You must be self-disciplined in society.</p>
<p>I would like to give you two words: "Pay attention." Learning is endless. You must not forget to learn after you are employed. Learning does not have to be in school. Do not be complacent and advance with the times. I encourage you.</p>
<p>Party Representative's Address</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Zaoxiong of Nanshi briefly said that this graduation is different from the past because of the examination. Academics are broad, so those who further their education should continue their future, and those who are employed should not give up their studies immediately, etc. Mr. Xu Yefu of Beishi briefly said that graduation is a period of transition to further education and social life, which is very important. Those who further their education should see the importance of saving the country by studying clearly. Studying without forgetting to save the country means studying to prepare for saving the country in the future. In the past, many students misunderstood and moved a lot of study time to saving the country, which not only wasted valuable time, but also caused young people with shallow experience and immature knowledge and unclear intentions to go astray. Therefore, in the future, we should recognize that serving the society is the most important thing, not to be discouraged and not to be complacent. It is easy to be discouraged when entering society from school. We should work hard to achieve hope. Discouragement is useless.</p>
<p>Principal's Address</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the principal of Junyi Middle School, the representative of the principals in Nanshi, said briefly that middle school is the most important in the process of school. Although primary school is the foundation, its age is young and its knowledge is not yet fully developed. Middle school is different. On the one hand, it is the foundation of university, and on the other hand, it is a good citizen of the country, so its importance is known. Therefore, the soundness of the country will depend on the development of secondary education in China. What China needs now is (1) to never forget that I am a citizen of China, a member of the Chinese nation, and a good citizen with Chinese national characteristics (2) a good citizen who is honest, persevering, hardworking, patient, studies hard, cultivates morality, exercises physically, and has group discipline. This should be what you should reflect on. Since secondary education is so important, the responsibilities of principals and teachers are of course important, but students should also pay attention to it, etc. Principal Wang Xiaoying of Cimuwu Middle School said briefly (1) those who further their education should know that they are receiving secondary education and then receiving higher education to build China (2) those who are employed should transform the bad society and must not be melted by the bad society, etc. Principal Tang Naikang of Beizhong Middle School delivered a speech in Beishi.</p>
<p>Finally, the students answered. The representatives of Nanshi are Jingye and Minli, and the representatives of Beishi are Wang Jue of Daxia Affiliated Middle School and Shen Jiayuan of Jianzhong.</p>

<p>Months of Dispute</p>
<p>Peacefully Resolved</p>
<p>Qualified Applicants Employed by the Trade Association Through Lottery</p>

After receiving the letter, the association immediately convened a follow-up meeting yesterday to properly resolve the matter. After discussion, the following measures were resolved: (1) How should the service store numbers and jobs of the 50 unemployed workers be allocated fairly? It was resolved to use a lottery method, and the names of the 50 people were written on paper rolls, and the counter duties were separated. The managers of the employing stores drew lots in public. The results of the lottery were announced as follows: Hu Qing Yu Tang: Dong Rusheng, Liu Songjun, Li Huaifang, Chen Shanzhang, Zhang Zhenhui, Sun Kaiyuan, Yu Tianzhu; Zhang Hanchun Tang: Shi Shanxiao, Sun Yunxia, Zhu Yuanlin, Shi Chunhui, Chen Yunbao, Gu Meixuan, Qiu Wangzhou; Cai Tongde Tang: Yu Xiaxian, Nie Jichang, Zhu Dongchen, Yang Guobin, Yu Bangheng; Ye Tiande Tang: Zhang Huaqing, Li Meihua; Wang Daji Tang: Mi Weixian, Lu Jusheng; Yu Liangxin Tang: Shen Jinsheng, Hu Lianfang; Su Cunde Tang: Gao Meiqing; Yao Taishan Tang: Feng Yongyuan, Jiang Yanzhe; Fa Ji Xu Dingtai; Tongdesheng Tang: Wang Yongsheng, Jiang Yanzhe; Rui Ji Fang Pinsheng; Feng Cunren Tang: Guo Yuankang, Chen Jinzhang; Xi Liangji Tang: Fei Fugen; Nanshi Qing Yu Tang: Zhou Yaseng, Wei Xiqi, Xu Chongdao, Du Jiabin, Yang Xuewei; Fang Fusheng, Bian Zucheng; Peng Shou Tang: Gu Jinfang; Ren Yihe Tang: Wang Xiangjun; Bei Yanzhe Tang: Zheng Xizhou; Xinchuan Road Tongde Tang: Wu Liangquan; Yangshupu Wansheng Tang: Xia Qinsheng; Hehe Yong Zheng Hengshan; Zide Tang: Zhu Chengjiang; Shu Tongshou Tang: Zhao Xianan; Zhang Yande Tang and French Concession Taishan Tang share one person: Wang Yongcai; Yan Dasheng Tang and Liu Shouquan Tang share one person: Yang Liansheng; Chao Yuqing Tang: Zhang Jinbao.

It was resolved to ask the Business Consolidation Committee to send a letter to the Citizens Training Association to order the trade union to quickly send the guarantee form of the 50 people to the association before the 30th of this month to comply with the procedures. (3) The unemployed workers who were forcibly placed by the trade union and forced to sign an acknowledgment should leave the shop on a fixed date. It was resolved to ask the Business Consolidation Committee to send a letter to the Citizens Training Association to strictly order the trade union to withdraw the number of people as soon as possible and not to delay. The 50 people who have been drawn will enter the shop to work on a fixed date after the previous batch has left the shop and prepared the procedures. (4) Among the 50 people, one named Gao Bingsheng has already found a job, so the association should select another person to fill the quota. It was resolved to use Zheng Hengshan to fill the quota. (5) The 51 unqualified unemployed workers have been given severance pay and dismissed, and their trade union membership certificates should be revoked. The severance pay received should be signed for by the recipient and sent to the association for record. It was resolved to transfer the matter to the Business Consolidation Committee and ask the Citizens Training Association to comply. (6) How should the salary of the 50 people who are employed this time be determined? It was resolved to issue the minimum amount of the originally set salary for each store, and to send a letter to the Business Consolidation Committee to forward it to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Citizens Training Association for reference. (7) The employment of 50 people in each store this time is an exception. The employees of the store should not use this as a request for promotion and salary calculation. It was resolved to ask the Business Consolidation Committee to forward a letter to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Citizens Training Association for reference. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

<p>Declaration of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Support Association to End</p>
<p>The Shanghai Trade Unions Aid Pharmaceutical Workers' Union Support Association declared its closure yesterday as the issue of the pharmaceutical workers' employment has been resolved, and published a closing statement as follows: In recent months, the local pharmaceutical workers have been resisting the employers' refusal to employ unemployed workers and oppressing trade unions, causing a major labor strike that has almost become unmanageable. This is a well-known event. We workers, standing on the same front, are very disgusted with the various actions of the pharmaceutical employers. In order to help fellow workers on the same front and to promote the awareness of the stubborn employers, we have organized a Pharmaceutical Workers' Support Association to provide economic and material support to the pharmaceutical workers who are oppressed by the employers and to be their strong backing. The purpose of our association is very simple: to help unemployed workers in order to promote the employers to accept their reasonable demands. The reason for the establishment of our association is also a manifestation of the workers' class being greatly stimulated and realizing the great unity and fighting against the evil forces. During the past working period, the workers have been able to do their best to help, so that the pharmaceutical workers have received a lot of spiritual and material comfort and help. The facts of this incident tell us that the Shanghai workers' class has indeed become aware. The pharmaceutical workers' strike has now been resolved peacefully, and the responsibilities and missions of our association can also be concluded. Our association convened a plenary committee meeting on June 20 to discuss the closing matters. All accounts have been reviewed by the appointed commissioner, and will be published in the newspapers as soon as the review is completed. The remaining funds have also been appointed to responsible personnel. Those trade unions that have already recognized the amount but have not paid will also be invalidated. From now on, our association announces its closure. The workers in the pharmaceutical industry were able to achieve considerable success this time, and the help of the city's workers is indelible. This is the benefit of our workers' great unity. In the future, if there are any stubborn employers who undermine labor-management cooperation and exploit workers' interests, the city's workers must unite and fight against them, otherwise it will not be enough to show the great power of the workers. Our great and beloved workers, please pay attention to this declaration.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Will Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>The crisis in the local cotton textile industry has been evident in recent years, with closures following one another. The industry's trade association has repeatedly requested relief from the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the fundamental relief still lies in solving all the current difficulties of the cotton textile industry, which is beyond the ability of a single city. It has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to consult the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for overall planning and review. After receiving a reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that it has a plan, it has consulted the Municipal Government and scheduled a meeting of factory owners to discuss concrete plans. The various news reports are recorded as follows: The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's reply to the Municipal Government: Regarding the matter of reply, according to the previous requests from the Municipal Business Consolidation Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau for relief of the cotton textile industry's dangerous situation, in addition to requesting the Ministry of Finance to reduce and exempt taxes and ordering the National Goods Bank to provide financial assistance, it is proposed to order the Social Affairs Bureau to inform the workers not to rush to request wage increases and to maintain the status quo, and to convene manufacturers to study ways to circulate accumulated goods in order to achieve the effect of official and commercial cooperation. As per the consultation, please check and handle. The Social Affairs Bureau Schedules a Meeting: After the Social Affairs Bureau received the instructions from the Municipal Government, and at the same time, it received a request from the local cotton textile workers' union to support workers and promote national goods in order to maintain the cotton textile industry, the bureau decided to convene a meeting of factory owners at the bureau at 9:00 AM on the 28th of this month in order to discuss concrete plans. It has already instructed the industry's trade association to forward the notice yesterday.</p>
<p>The Trade Association Discusses Proposals: The industry's trade association has been requesting relief since it first submitted the request for relief, and in the blink of an eye, a year has passed. The crisis is even worse, and the general members and manufacturers are all worried. After receiving the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, it was scheduled to hold a members' meeting at the Ruilin Li Association on Edward Road at 12:00 PM on today (26th) to discuss in detail the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's relief measures and management methods, and then submit a proposal to the Social Affairs Bureau to be included in the agenda.</p>

<p>Emergency Meeting Minutes</p>
<p>The Jiang-Zhe Silk Loom Association has recently received reports from fellow merchants in various districts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces stating that this year's silkworm cocoon harvest is poor, raw materials are severely lacking, and foreign firms are competing to purchase fresh cocoons and transport them overseas, resulting in a decrease in silk reeling. Our country's silk industry is facing a shortage of raw materials, industrial stagnation, and soaring silk prices, which have reached a high of two and a half fields. There is a continued upward trend in prices. At a time when the nation is advocating for domestic goods amidst the trend of financial stringency, costs should be reduced, and everyone should work together. However, due to the high cost of silk, the current selling price of silk fabrics does not cover the costs, resulting in significant losses for silk factories, increased closures, and growing unemployment. For the sake of preserving the industry, it seems appropriate to consider increasing the selling price to sustain the industry. Matters concerning how to alleviate the silk cocoon raw material shortage, reduce unreasonable taxes, and promote domestic silk fabrics must be discussed in a general meeting and implemented after a public resolution. Therefore, a joint meeting of silk merchants from the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang was convened on the 22nd. The representatives from the provinces who attended were: (1) Suzhou silk industry representatives: Shi Junqing, Yu Wenqing, Chen Guiting, Cheng Lisheng, Ma Yangshi, Yao Keshen, Wang Shengshan, Liu Guangyuan; Shanghai representatives: Wang Xingyi, Xu Wenbing, Wang Shoushen, Gu Shenglu; (2) Hangzhou silk industry representatives: Lu Zhengbing (represented by Tu Shuqing), Ye Jinkang, Chen Jianming, Yang Hanqing; (3) Huzhou silk industry representatives: Pan Yisheng, Fei Rongfang, Xu Jinsheng, Wang Hesun; (4) Shengjing silk industry representatives: Wang Shaocun, Cheng Huisheng; (5) Danyang silk industry representative: Zhou Lianbo. The meeting commenced at 3 PM with the ringing of a bell. Wang Jie'an was elected as chairman. After following the formal opening procedures, Sun Zheng recorded the minutes. The chairman announced the purpose of the meeting and read letters from fellow merchants in the two provinces, detailing the industry's decline and precarious situation in recent years. It was stated that unless the merchants of the two provinces unite and discuss ways to alleviate the suffering, and request the government to implement effective measures, the crisis cannot be averted. After considering various proposals, the following resolutions were made: (1) New pricing proposal: The entire assembly voted to temporarily increase the price by one and a half points starting July 1st, as per the spring market, and to publish this in the newspapers (local and foreign). Future discussions will be held to further address this. (2) Alleviating the silk cocoon raw material shortage: It was resolved to petition the government to reiterate the restriction on establishing new cocoon businesses in the old nine prefectures of the two provinces (Suzhou, Ningbo, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang in Jiangsu; Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in Zhejiang), as per previous decisions. (3) Promoting domestic silk fabrics: It was resolved to petition the government, in conjunction with the China National Products Preservation Association, to explicitly restrict the use of Western clothing and implement Article 6 of the Clothing System Regulations, which limits the use of domestic goods and imposes penalties on violators. (4) Petitioning the government to establish a national artificial silk factory: The resolution was passed. (5) Reducing taxes on domestic silk fabrics: It was resolved to petition the government to exempt all taxes to alleviate the burdens on the silk industry. (6) Revising the Factory Law provisions: It was resolved to petition the government to revise Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the law (which applies to factories that regularly employ 30 or more workers), changing the number "30" to "1,000" to better suit the conditions of small-scale industrial factories in the country. After the discussions, refreshments were served, and the meeting was adjourned with the ringing of a bell at around 6 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Petitioning to the Capital <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Cigarette Industry Representatives Detail Grievances</p>
<p>Party and Government Organs Express Support</p>
<p>Representatives from the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Guild, facing potential bankruptcy due to raw material shortages, foreign taxes, and pricing issues, were dispatched to the capital on the 23rd. This delegation, consisting of Lang Tingsheng, Shen Xingde, and Liu Chenglong (representing the Guangdong Guild), carried letters to various ministries to present their case. This newspaper has extensively reported on this matter. It is now known that Yu Qiaqing, a member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's committee handling this case, also arrived in Beijing on the same day. On the morning of the 24th, the representatives visited the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, where they were received by Vice Minister Mu Ouchu and Director Zhang Yiou. The representatives passionately described the current difficulties faced by the cigarette industry and provided evidence of their inability to sustain operations, requesting urgent assistance. Vice Minister Mu and Director Zhang responded that the Ministry had been aware of the difficulties faced by the Chinese cigarette industry and that the issues raised in the petition were valid. They stated that since a specific request had been made, they would work with the Ministry of Finance to find appropriate solutions and provide practical assistance. However, they emphasized that the Chinese cigarette industry should cultivate a long-term vision, consolidate its strength, and seek commercial advantages through unity, as businesses that neglect the power of unity ultimately fail. They hoped this would serve as a lesson. In the afternoon, the representatives visited the Executive Yuan, where they were received by Liu Gongqian, the Chairman's Secretary. They reiterated their grievances as described above. Liu responded that the Executive Yuan was aware of the extreme distress faced by the Chinese cigarette industry and had already planned to work with the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Finance to develop solutions to alleviate the crisis, aid the development of the industry, and ensure the well-being of the people. The representatives then departed after expressing their concerns. Subsequent news indicated that the association's representatives visited the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 25th to submit their petition.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Domestic Towels Granted Tax Exemption <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Subject to Certification by the Industry Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously forwarded a petition from the National Towel Industry Association requesting tax exemptions for domestically produced towels to promote their sales. This petition has now been approved. The association's letter to the National Towel Industry Association is quoted below: "On the 18th of this month, we received an electric message from the Ministry of Finance, forwarded through the Chamber of Commerce, regarding the request by the Shanghai National Towel Industry Association to exempt domestic towels from internal taxes. The three ministries have instructed the Special Commissioner of Finance for Jiangsu Province to review the matter and submit a response. According to the response received, 'We have received Order No. 14518 from your ministry, forwarding the request from the Shanghai National Towel Industry Association, via an electric message from the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee, to exempt domestic towels from internal taxes, instructing this office to review the matter and submit a response.' Upon receiving this order, we promptly complied. We also received a petition from representatives of the association, including Zhang Zilian, stating that domestic towels are taxed on raw materials, semi-finished products, finishing, printing, transportation, and sales, resulting in excessively high costs and difficult sales, which is a realistic situation. Machine-made towels have already been exempted from taxes upon petition. The majority of these domestic towels are produced in family industries. The question of whether internal taxes can be exempted or modified has been referred to the Special Tax Bureau, which has summoned representatives of the industry to inquire and discuss a compromise. According to the response received, the annual output of domestic towels in this province is approximately one million dozens, with roughly half being sold domestically and half being exported. The majority of production is concentrated in Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Chongming, Jiading, and Pudong in Shanghai, with some production in Gangshan, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing. In addition, many other counties produce towels in similar family industries for local consumption. Except for local sales and small-scale carrying, which are not reported for taxation, all towels produced by large and small factories and family industries in Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Chongming, Jiading, and Pudong around Shanghai are transported as semi-finished products for finishing or transported to Shanghai for finishing, printing, and then wholesaled to various ports. As such, wholesale centers for these towels are concentrated in Shanghai. When wholesaling and transshipping, they are often packed in boxes with various cotton fabrics or foreign goods. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the total towel tax in the province, excluding customs duties, was 3,634 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen, and 6 li. This refers specifically to towels reported for transportation; items bundled in boxes are taxed based on an estimated rate per item and are not included. However, cotton goods such as gloves, socks, scarves, and undershirts are daily necessities and are often produced in family industries. It is not just towels that face this issue. If towels are exempted from taxes, there will inevitably be a cascade of requests for similar exemptions, which is difficult to deny. Moreover, towels that have been exempted from taxes, when bundled with various cotton goods for shipment to various ports, may be falsely declared as foreign goods or may be mixed with items that have not been exempted from taxes. If tax authorities were to inspect each box, the procedures would become even more difficult, and merchants might use this as an excuse to create unnecessary trouble, ultimately impacting tax revenues. After receiving the order, the committee repeatedly summoned representatives, including Zhang Zilian, to conduct further inquiries and detailed discussions. It was generally agreed that not exempting taxes would make it impossible for the industry to survive, while granting a general exemption would lead to various disputes that are difficult to prevent and would be self-inflicted trouble. The only solution is to carefully consider the situation and make a flexible compromise to reduce taxes, so as to not hinder either national revenue or industry. Considering the tax revenue in the eighteenth year, a large portion comes from towels produced in Baoshan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Chongming, Jiading, and Pudong and transported to Shanghai for finishing and wholesaling. Wholesaling from Shanghai to other ports still requires bundling and reporting for taxation, so the issue of double taxation cannot be ignored. Special taxes were originally separated from the Likin tax, so comprehensive consideration should be given to both. Furthermore, with the clear order to abolish the Likin tax in October of this year, goods exempted from taxes should be included in the abolished Likin tax plan. During this transition period, it is proposed that large and small factories and family industries in Baoshan, Chongming, Jiading, Chuansha, Nanhui, and Pudong be required to have a certificate from the Towel Industry Association verifying that the goods are not of inferior quality and are indeed being transported for finishing and wholesaling, before being inspected and released without taxation. Shipments from Shanghai to other ports, whether transported individually or bundled, and goods that the association believes are being transported with inferior products or goods for which the association refuses to issue a certificate, should be taxed according to regulations. This approach avoids double taxation, simplifies inspection, and prevents the passing off of foreign goods as domestic goods. This provides special consideration for family industries while also requiring manufacturers and businesses to fulfill their tax obligations. This approach aligns with the Ministry's intention to promote domestic goods. We have attached a sample certificate form to the report for review. It seems appropriate to approve the proposed method of taxing domestic towels, with tax exemptions for goods being transported for finishing and wholesaling, and to have the Towel Industry Association issue certificates to prevent fraud, as well as the proposed certificate form. Please review and approve accordingly. To the National Towel Industry Association.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Ham Industry <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Opposing Increased Taxes in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Petitioning for the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Rescind the Taxes</p>
<p>Jinhua, Zhejiang province, is the primary producer of ham. Last year, the local ham industry experienced a decline due to various factors. In June of this year, the Zhejiang Department of Finance suddenly announced an increase in taxes, prompting widespread opposition. Local ham merchants also submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Department and the Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to forward the petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to rescind the newly established tax rates. The petition is quoted below: "Regarding the illegal increase in ham taxes by Zhejiang province, which exceeds the previous tax rate by one and a half times, we request you to forward this to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to rescind the new tax rate, in order to benefit the people and alleviate commercial hardship. Before the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the ham and cured meat tax in Zhejiang province was 6 fen of silver for each ham and 8 jiao and 4 fen of silver for every hundred catties of cured meat. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, it was changed to 9 fen of silver for each ham and 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 6 fen of silver for every hundred catties of cured meat. The people already found this to be an unbearable burden. The Zhejiang Department of Finance suddenly issued a notice stating that, starting from June 1st of this year, the tax would be changed to 1 jiao and 5 fen of silver for each ham and 1 jiao and 5 fen of silver for every ten catties of cured meat. In addition, the Zhejiang West Water Conservancy fee of 7 li and 5 hao is added when passing through Zhejiang West, which is more than one and a half times the tax rate before the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, and even compared to the current tax rate, it is an increase of 40 percent. What is the purpose of this? It is incomprehensible. At a time when there is no change in the taxation of all goods, the tax on ham has increased by 40 percent, which is clearly inappropriate. Ham production in Jinhua, Lanxi, Dongyang, Yiwu, Yongkang, and Pujiang counties in eastern Zhejiang is of great importance to the livelihoods of the people. Farmers in the region rely on raising pigs to obtain fertilizer, which directly and indirectly benefits agricultural production. Therefore, they view raising pigs as a secondary occupation. Beans, wheat bran, and husks can be used as pig feed, and pig urine and manure can be used as fertilizer for fields, creating a cycle of mutual benefit. Recently, there has been a tooth tax on buying pigs and a slaughter tax on killing pigs. Repeated exploitation has made it difficult to raise pigs for fertilizer. Since fertilizer is not easily obtained, there is no hope for a bumper harvest of crops, and farmers are forced to purchase imported fertilizer powder to replace it, leading to an outflow of money and hardship for farmers. This is a cause for concern among those who understand the situation. Now, the repeated increase in tax rates is akin to driving fish into the deep. The silk industry in western Zhejiang has been squeezed by foreign goods, leading to a decline in the market. To save domestic products, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has reduced the annual silk tax from 840,000 yuan to 440,000 yuan since last winter. Ham and silk are both products of Zhejiang province, but their tax rates are increasing for one and decreasing for the other. Are the people of eastern and western Zhejiang fortunate and unfortunate, respectively? The association has witnessed the difficulties of the times and fears that if the provincial government does not protect ham, it will be destroyed. In ten or twenty years, there will be no families raising pigs or businesses pickling ham, let alone tax revenue. The harms of official and civilian contributions are obvious. Therefore, we are detailing the reasons and requesting your association to forward this to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting them to rescind the newly established tax rates to alleviate the hardship of the people and maintain commercial stability (remainder omitted)."</p>

<p>Import, Export, and Transit</p>
<p>Food Inspection and Registration Regulations of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining</p>
<p>Approved by the Central Political Council</p>
<p>The Central Political Council has approved the import, export, and transit food inspection and registration regulations based on the recommendations of the Food Committee and has instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to order agricultural product inspection offices or local governments to implement them. As previously reported, Shanghai, being the primary port for import, export, and transit of food, should prioritize inspection and registration to regulate food supply in the Yangtze River provinces. Upon receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining immediately instructed the Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Office, under Director Jin Wensi, to prepare accordingly. Director Jin contacted leading rice merchants in Shanghai, including Ye Huijun, to discuss inspection and registration procedures. The office drafted the Shanghai Import, Export, and Transit Food Inspection and Registration Regulations and submitted them to the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry then revised the regulations, changing "rice" to "food" to make them applicable to inspection and registration agencies in all ports. The revised regulations were submitted to the Executive Yuan for record-keeping. Considering the national importance of food supply, the Executive Yuan deemed the matter too important for a simple proclamation and forwarded it to the National Government for consideration by the Central Political Council. The Central Political Council then referred it to the Food Committee for review. The Food Committee's specialists made minor revisions and submitted the regulations to the Central Political Council for approval before being officially promulgated by the National Government. The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has already instructed the agricultural product inspection office to establish a special task force to prepare actively. The regulations will be implemented as soon as they are promulgated by the Ministry.</p>

<p>Hu Shixing and two others were searched one by one. Only Lu was found to be carrying a fake inspection license. All were sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning, where they were interrogated by Chief Judge Zhou Hanting. Officer Wang stated how the group had fabricated an agency to exploit the people. According to the seized report, the group would first fabricate the report, and when they wanted to extort money from someone, they would show them the report and claim that they had discovered what crime the person had committed, urging them to quickly pay money to keep it quiet, otherwise they would report it to their superiors. The defendant Zhou Bin specialized in selling fake inspection titles in the concession. Those who wanted to obtain an inspector's position should pay a hundred gold. Xie Hongsheng specialized in soliciting. Those who wanted to become inspectors had to be introduced by him. The license found on him was requested by Zhu Guodong to be introduced, and it was issued by the fake headquarters but had not yet been transferred to Zhu. It has now been seized. However, the leader of the team, Tang Guangyao, and his accomplices are all on the run. Judge Zhou questioned the defendants, who all confessed due to the conclusive evidence. However, the headquarters of this case is located in the Chinese area, so Judge Zhou instructed that the defendants be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.</p>

<p>Zhang Taijie Case</p>
<p>Judgment on July 1st</p>
<p>The case of Zhang Taijie, manager of the Sichuan Road Company, being sued by Zeng Xianzhi, the representative of the directors, in the Local Court for embezzlement of road funds and property, was continued yesterday morning at 10:00 am by Chief Judge Shen Bingrong, together with assessors Wu Zhen and Qian Chengjun, in the First Tribunal. The defense lawyers for the defendant Zhang Taijie, Xu Yuangao and Tu Jingxin, the defense lawyer for the defendant Dong Yu, Shan Yuhua, and the plaintiff's lawyers Yu Zhongluo and Tan Yiwu, all appeared in court as scheduled. The judge asked Zhang Taijie, "You said Cheng Xuelou borrowed 20,000, and Dong Yu gave you 7,000?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "You said there was a receipt for the legal fees of 30%?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Was it issued that day?" (Answer) "Yes, it was issued at his office that day." (Question) "Was Ao Shao'an present when the receipt was written?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "You can settle it with 7,000?" (Answer) "I didn't know at the time." (Question) "You shouldn't have set up an office in Shanghai. Although the Beijing court dismissed the case, it was for the sake of the amnesty." (Answer) "My title as manager has not been revoked. It must be decided by a shareholders' meeting before another office can be set up. How can it be done casually? It's simply illegal." At this point, Dong Yu was asked, "Have you brought Cheng Xuelou's certificate?" (Answer) "Yes, I have." He then presented it. (Question) "You didn't handle the payment yourself at the time?" (Answer) "No, Zhang Taijie sent another representative to lawyer Li Shizui's office." (Question) "His office is set up in your office?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "When was the 500 taels of public funds paid?" (Answer) "The next day, Zhang handed it over in person. The receipt was written at the time." (Question) "Is there a stub?" (Answer) "No." (Question) "Are there account books?" (Answer) "Because it was a sole proprietorship, there are no account books." (Question) "You are a legal consultant, so you must be careful not to leave any loopholes. How much did they actually repay?" (Answer) "This was entirely their own sentiment." (Question) "According to the rules, your office should have stubs." (Answer) "Some have, some don't. Now, the Jiang Baoli law firm can also be cited as an example of not having stubs." At this point, (Question) "Ao Shao'an, who introduced you to the office?" (Answer) "Wu Junming introduced me." (Question) "Did you know Dong Yu before?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Are the company's accounts at your place?" (Answer) "Not at my place." (Question) "How much of Cheng Xuelou's money did Dong Yu actually take?" (Answer) "He said it was 7,000 taels when he gave it to me, but he only gave me 4,500 taels." At this point, Zeng Xianzhi was asked, "Does the company have articles of association?" (Answer) "Only in Chengdu." (Question) "Is it legal for Zhang Taijie to set up an office in Shanghai?" (Answer) "The company's office is only in Hankou, and he did not notify when he set up an office in Shanghai." Zhang Taijie elaborated, saying, "Do they deserve to be notified? They are just a bunch of hooligans." However, in our hometown, Tan Yi Gong, thinks I am extremely sinful, but I believe I am meritorious." At this point, Prosecutor Liu Pingfan gave his opinion, saying, "Regardless of what happened before this case, it has already been amnestied and cannot be pursued. The current prosecution is very simple. It concerns the Hanyeping property and Cheng Xuelou's loan, which the defendant admitted. However, he was convicted in Beijing in the twelfth year, but the amnesty, according to the law, he is not allowed to exercise his duties. Therefore, setting up an office in Shanghai is completely illegal. The crime is beyond doubt. As for Zhang Taijie suing Dong Yu for embezzlement, lawyers suing for debts are also a specialty in their duties. The public fee is what the lawyer should receive. However, it is worth investigating who exactly received Cheng Xuelou's more than 20,000 yuan. There must be definite proof of this. However, since the lawyer can represent, he can represent taking the money. There is no need to send someone else. He requests that it be judged according to the law." At this point, the defendant's lawyer</p>
<p>After the first defense, the judge announced the conclusion of the public prosecution debate and began the private prosecution trial. The plaintiff's lawyer said, "Regarding the remaining parts, we will file another case. Regarding this case, we request that the court order the recovery of 17 Hanyeping shares, one Qinghua Company IOU and its attached shares, and Cheng Xuelou's loan of 34,000 taels. If they cannot be handed over, they should be ordered to repay 485,850 taels and 4 qian and 8 fen of silver." The judge questioned Zhang Taijie, who claimed that the plaintiff was not qualified to make this claim and had nothing to say. The judge then announced the conclusion of the debate and ordered the defendant Zhang Taijie to be returned to custody for sentencing at 11:00 am on July 1st.</p>

<p>Dies Tragically from a Gunshot Wound on His Birthday</p>
<p>The Birthday Feast Was Not Held Before the Birthday Star Passed Away</p>
<p>He Has a Wife in His Hometown and a Lover in Shanghai</p>
<p>A Mystery of Accidental Killing or Suicide</p>
<p>Canadian C.W. Maisbale, who has been working as the secretary of the Shanghai Club at 3 The Bund for many years, was to celebrate his 55th birthday yesterday. Relatives and friends were planning to hold a birthday celebration for Mr. Maisbale in the evening. However, before the birthday feast could be held, the tragic news arrived first. Maisbale committed suicide in his private room at sunset. The news spread, and everyone was amazed. According to the servants, Mr. Mai was alone in his private room after lunch. The servants dared not enter without being called. At about 2:00 pm, Mr. Mai ordered his attendant to prepare machine oil for him. He also ordered the tobacconist to bring cigarettes. His attitude was leisurely and did not seem like he was about to face a major disaster. At about 4:50 pm, the attendant entered his private room again and saw Mr. Mai carefully wiping his gun with machine oil. Half an hour later, the tragedy suddenly occurred. A loud bang was heard from the room, followed by a loud sound. More than a dozen servants were working in the room next to Mai's residence. Hearing the sound, they rushed to Mai's room and opened the door. They saw the birthday star lying stiff on the ground, with bloodstains all over his chest, moaning non-stop. The manager quickly summoned a doctor for emergency treatment, but it was too late. Mr. Mai had already passed away by the time the doctor arrived. The bullet entered from the right chest and did not exit. After receiving the news, detectives were dispatched to investigate. They saw the deceased lying stiff on the ground, with a Hebble-style .45 caliber pistol beside him. It was not certain whether it was suicide or accidental killing. Mr. Mai's wife lives in his hometown in Canada, and they still exchanged letters a month ago. However, Mai had another lover in Shanghai, living at 12 Gongguan Road in the French Concession. He died tragically from a gunshot wound on his birthday. Even if it was not suicide, this ending is still tragic.</p>

<p>Tung Oil Turned into Clear Water</p>
<p>Boatmen Collude in Fraud</p>
<p>Exposure Due to Uneven Distribution of Spoils</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Portuguese company Baoli Yanghang entrusted Chen Jiangji Lighter Company to transport 116 barrels of tung oil to the Japanese ship Kinzan Maru to be shipped overseas. The company sent boatmen Shi Jinchu, Chen Yinchu, Zhang Linxuan, Sun Chuanjiang, etc. to load onto the ship. Due to customs inspection, the loading was not completed until the 12th. They then transported the boat to Xiqiong Port and opened 24 barrels of tung oil, pouring the oil into another boat and filling the empty barrels with clear water. Then they nailed them shut and mixed them in with the tung oil, successfully smuggling them onto the ship, which has already sailed overseas. In total, more than 4,000 yuan worth of tung oil was stolen. However, because there were more than a dozen people involved and the spoils were not distributed evenly, an anonymous letter was sent to the foreign company, who reported it to the Water Patrol Police Station for investigation. Detectives Wang Haiquan, Ge Changsheng, and Shen Agui were dispatched and arrested Shi Jinchu, Chen Yinchu, Zhang Linxuan, Sun Chuanjiang, etc. They also telegraphed the Kinzan Maru to inquire. The ship replied that after unpacking, more than 20 boxes were indeed clear water. The case was then revealed. Yesterday, the head constable issued an order for the detectives to transfer the defendants to the Local Court for trial.</p>

<p>Wang Songsong, a resident of the last house in the first alley of Xin Xieye Lane, South City River Road, Wusong, lost his wife, Gu, to illness last month. When Gu was alive, her relationship with Wang was extremely harmonious. Therefore, Wang was very saddened by Gu's death. Yesterday was the fifth seventh-day memorial service after Gu's death. Wang, unable to comfort his feelings, specially hired Taoist priests to perform rituals at his home and ordered a large paper house from a paper crafts shop, costing about a hundred yuan. The paper house was fully equipped with various furnishings and was extremely grand and gorgeous. At about 5:00 pm yesterday, a fire was lit on the vacant lot east of the Wusong Town Station to burn it. The flames soared into the sky, resembling a fire alarm. It took about an hour to burn completely. A large crowd gathered to watch the spectacle.</p>

<p>Ren Boxuan, residing at 505 Datong Road, suddenly received a threatening letter on the 8th of this month demanding 12,000 yuan. Ren smiled and ignored it. However, on the 14th, he received another letter from the bandits demanding the same amount as before. Ren sent the two letters to the Xinzha Police Station for investigation and immediately set off for Beiping to avoid harassment. However, on the 19th, the bandits sent a third letter to Ren, stating that they would meet at the entrance of the Jing'an Temple at 9:00 am on the 20th. Ren's family sent Jin Afu as agreed. Jin returned and reported that he arrived at the agreed location shortly before encountering a bandit. They began negotiations, but because the two sides could not agree on the amount, they changed the appointment to between 7:00 and 8:00 am on the 21st in front of a teahouse on Hart Road. Ren's family reported this to the police station, who sent detectives to accompany Jin. They did not see anything. Until the day before yesterday (the morning of the 23rd), the bandits sent a person to Ren's back door to sneakily insert a letter through the door seam. Fearing that his family would not know, they rang the doorbell installed at the door and knocked loudly on the door. The people in the house heard the sound and opened the door, picking up the bandit's fourth letter from the ground, stating that they would meet at the entrance of the Vatican Palace on Route Sainte-Marie in the French Concession between 6:00 and 7:00 pm that day. Ren's family changed the representative to Zhu Baosheng to meet and talk. The bandits demanded 10,000 yuan, and Zhu agreed to 6,000 yuan, but still without result. They re-appointed at the end of Datong Road on Baker Road at 10:00 am on the 24th. At that time, the police station sent Chinese and foreign detectives to ambush around. Zhu held a newspaper in one hand as a sign and held a paper bag in the other hand, pretending to be banknotes. Shortly after, Li Afu, a Hangzhou native from the bandit side, swaggered over and talked to Zhu. He was then arrested by the detectives and sent to the Special District Local Court yesterday. Judge Wu interrogated him, and police station lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the process. The defendant also confessed without denying. Judge Wu ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the trial for the morning of July 4th.</p>

<p>Misunderstandings Arise Between the Two Sides, Leading to Disputes</p>
<p>Inviting Many People, Almost Leading to a Brawl</p>
<p>At about 9:00 pm the night before last in front of the Tongxing Restaurant in Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, a quarrel occurred due to diners harassing women. Both sides invited dozens of people, each carrying weapons, to seek trouble. The Public Security Bureau sent police to the scene before they dispersed. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Daughter Lives Romantically at 12 Caishi Street, Xujiahui. The Catholic Yu Rongsheng opened a Tongxing Restaurant in the town, which is doing well. His wife, Yin, has five daughters and one son. The eldest daughter has passed away. The second daughter, named A Er, is 25 years old and unmarried. Three years ago, she became acquainted with Ji Zhongming from Luodian, who was the accountant. She privately gave birth to a son named Mao Di, who is currently being raised at home and is two years old. The third daughter, A San, is 21 years old and has been betrothed to Jin Abao, who is engaged in lacework in the same town. The fourth daughter, A Si, also known as Cui Zhen, is only 19 years old, with bright eyes and white teeth, a modern haircut, and previously studied in the Chongde Girls' Middle School Department. In August of last year, Ji stopped working due to an incident, and Cui Zhen took over the accounting duties in the store. Swarms of playboys flocked to her. Xu Guanbao, a handsome young man, often invited friends to Yu's house to play mahjong, and was therefore very close to the Yu sisters. Rongsheng spent all day smoking opium and did not care, resulting in a bad reputation. Nearby neighbors were very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Causes and Consequences At the beginning of last month, neighbors Wu Chunquan, Zhou Fusheng, Wang Chuntao, etc. were skipping rope together at the back door of Yu's house. Cui Zhen also joined in the game. Later, Chunquan broke his watch, and there was a slight dispute with Guanbao. Then they dispersed. On the 22nd of this month, Chuang Sijin from Jiangyin, who bought beef, reserved two tables of banquet at Tongxing Restaurant for his child's full moon, so that he could entertain guests in the evening. Cui Zhen mistakenly believed that the group was swearing allegiance to each other and was detrimental to her, so she sent a letter to Xu asking him to pay attention. Xu Guanbao</p>

<p>was also not to be outdone and went to dinner with his family and friends that evening. It is not known how, but he had a quarrel with Zhou Fusheng, the owner of the Fushun cigarette paper shop, who was sitting opposite him. Then, more than 20 burly men rushed upstairs and asked why the matter had started. Xu pointed to Zhou Fusheng's harassment of his wife as the reason. Fortunately, Tang Liangchen, a 70-year-old man at the same table, tried his best to refute the false accusation and stated that it was a full moon wine and not a swearing allegiance. At this time, Xu, the director of the Second Branch of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned of the incident and, fearing trouble, immediately sent a police officer to arrest them.

It is said that they plan to obtain permits from the authorities to travel in the Chinese interior, and then walk to Hankou and then to Tibet, and then through India, Mesopotamia, Africa to Europe. They also plan to cross the ocean to America, walk from New York to San Francisco, and then go to New Orleans, leave the land and board a boat to South America. Their luggage is very light, only buying a few necessary daily necessities.

<p>Two Robbery and Theft Bandits Apprehended</p>
<p>Two Handguns Seized from Two Locations</p>
<p>Victims of Each Case Arrived to Testify</p>
<p>The leader of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Captain Lu, received a report from the Zhabei foremen Wang Shifu and Su Sheng the day before yesterday, stating that they had received a confidential tip from an informant, claiming that the current perpetrators of robberies at the home of Xu Shouru, a Yancheng native on Tiantong Road in Zhabei, and at the Rongtai Cigarette and Paper Store, operated by a Jiangdu woman named Dai Li on Lane 6, No. 99 O'Connor Road, namely the bandits Zhang Jinbiao, Xu Renhuai, and Song Jinbiao, etc., were all hiding in the vicinity of the Pingjiang Bridge, Hu Family Wooden Bridge, and Dayang Bridge in Zhabei. They requested that officers be dispatched quickly to arrest them. Upon receiving the report, Captain Lu immediately ordered the two foremen, Wang and Su, to lead detectives Lü Xingchun, Wang Yao, Dou Yulin, Ying Defa, and Liu Yongfu to rush to Pingjiang Bridge at 9 PM the night before, where they coordinated with the district chief and police officers to first apprehend the two suspects, Song and Xu. Then, at around 1 AM yesterday, they continued to apprehend Zhang Jinbiao and Zhang Wang, along with a No. 45205 six-inch Browning handgun with thirty-seven bullets, at No. 9 Fushen Lane, Hu Family Wooden Bridge, District Five. At 5 AM, they apprehended another accomplice, Zhou Rongfa, on Baoshan Road and brought them all to the team. After Captain Lu interrogated them in detail, Zhang Jinbiao confessed that he was 35 years old, from Funing, and lived at No. 9 Fuxing Lane, Hu Family Wooden Bridge, Zhabei. Xu Renhuai confessed that he was 29 years old, from Yancheng, and worked as a rickshaw puller on a small boat on Pingjiang Bridge.

The woman Song Wang confessed that she was 32 years old and cohabited with the suspect Zhang. All the suspects readily admitted to gathering a crowd and committing robbery with weapons. Just as the interrogation was underway, another confidential report arrived, stating that the robbers Wu Guangfa (also known as Little Factory), Tan Linqiang, and Xiao Zixin, who had committed robberies at the homes of residents along the Fangbang Bridge and Xianggua Street in Nanshi in March of this year, were currently enjoying tea at the Qingfeng Tea House on Fangxie Road. Captain Lu, upon hearing the report, immediately ordered the original detectives to coordinate with the officers and police of the Second District to apprehend the three suspects at the address. They also apprehended four suspects, including Pan Baogen, on the spot, and seized a No. 33874 six-inch Browning handgun with bullets from Wu's person. Guangfa confessed that he was 34 years old, from Zhenjiang, and Xiao Zixin confessed that he was 30 years old, from Jiangdu. Both suspects had no fixed address. Tan Linqiang confessed that he was 25 years old, from Jiangdu, and lived in a flat in Zhang Family Residence, Carter Road. All suspects readily admitted the crimes.

<p>Ni A'er is Terribly Ferocious</p>
<p>Wang Zuoqing, residing at No. 248 Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession, visited a friend at No. 11 Taiyuan Lane in the French Concession at 9:30 PM on the 7th of this month. While walking to the alley entrance, he was suddenly grabbed and beaten by his enemy, Ni A'er, along with Zhu Miaofa and the fugitive Wang A'si. Ni pulled out a sharp axe and struck Wang's left leg, causing a profuse amount of blood to flow out. Wang, in extreme pain, fainted and fell to the ground. The police, upon learning of the incident, rushed to the scene and apprehended Ni and Zhu, taking them to the police station. Wang A'si, the accomplice, escaped without a trace. Wang Zuoqing was immediately transported to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police sent Ni and others to the French Concession Court for investigation. According to the Western Chief Sa Cai'er's report, the plaintiff Wang Zuoqing's injuries were very serious, and his left leg had been amputated by a Western doctor, leaving him disabled. He requested a severe investigation into the defendants' cruelty. Ni A'er confessed that he made a living selling rock candy and preserved plums, and that he owed the plaintiff one dollar for playing mahjong with him. He had repeatedly asked for repayment but was repeatedly insulted. This fueled his anger and led him to commit the assault. Zhu Miaofa confessed that he was invited by Ni A'er to help with the assault and requested leniency. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced Ni to two and a half years in a Western prison and Zhu to eight months as a warning. The axe was confiscated.</p>

<p>How Can They Claim the Mother is Unable to Support Herself?</p>
<p>Qian Chen's Alimony Case Awaits Sentencing</p>
<p>Qian Chen, the concubine of Qian Yukun from Ningbo, bore two sons named Zongfu and Zongying. The first wife and other concubines also bore four sons named Zongqing, Zongming, Zongde, and Zongxiang. After Yukun's death, the wives and concubines were each supported by their own sons and lived peacefully for over a decade. Recently, Qian Chen suddenly demanded that all the sons jointly provide support and hired a lawyer to sue Zongqing and others in the Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendants be ordered to pay alimony of 60,000 yuan. The trial proceedings were reported previously. The court continued to convene yesterday morning. Apart from Xu Zongfu and Zongying, all the defendants hired lawyers to oppose the plaintiff's request. The lawyer of the third and fourth sons, Jiang Yiping, also stated that while the lawsuit superficially appears to be Qian Chen requesting alimony, in reality, it is a dispute between Zongying, Zongfu, and Zongqing, etc. He noted that the sons born to the plaintiff travel by car, so how can they claim that the mother is unable to support herself? Therefore, the accusation is without reason and should be dismissed. After further arguments between the plaintiff's lawyer and the defense, Judge Xu announced that the sentencing would be given on the morning of the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>Yangshupu police station currently serving police officers Tao Yaqing, Xi Ligong, and Wang Peilin were accused of assaulting Xu Maoji, the owner of the construction site at No. 33 Beikai'er Road. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge of the Special District Local Court conducted a joint trial. According to Xu's testimony, Tao first came to demand 12 yuan for a small cart fee on May 10th, and when he didn't get it, he came again in the evening to pick a quarrel and beat him. He was then taken to the police station, where Xi and Wang joined in the assault, causing injuries to his hands and feet. He then submitted a medical certificate as evidence. Tao testified that because the rickshaw pullers at Xu's construction site were not following orders, he had confiscated their carts and taken them to the police station, which angered Xu. On that day, while he was patrolling near the construction site, Xu suddenly insulted him. When he argued with him, Xu assaulted him and damaged his uniform, so he arrested him. Because he tried to escape en route, Wang helped to handcuff him and take him to the police station. He denied extorting money. Xi and Wang completely denied the accusations against them. However, a Guo-surname shoemaker testified that he had witnessed Tao extorting money from Xu when he was delivering shoes to Xu's place that day. After hearing the testimonies, Judge Ge sentenced Tao Jinqing to two months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Tao was also allowed to post 200 yuan bail during the appeal period. Xi and Wang were acquitted.</p>

<p>Wang Cailang, a native of Chongming, was suddenly strangled to death on the night of the 18th of this month at 9:30 PM in the wilderness of Kunming Road, Taopeng Road. The murderer fled. Only at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday did Detective Su Changsheng of the Huishan Police Station apprehend Shi Shunqing, also from Chongming, at the home of Chen Wu, a Chongming woman, at No. 69 Shenjiatan, Yangshupu. Chen Wu was also arrested in connection. Yesterday morning, they were brought before Judge Feng of the Special District Local Court for investigation. Detective Su presented three ropes, a blue rope taken from the deceased's hands and a white rope used to strangle his neck, as evidence. Shi Shunqing testified that Wang Cailang had previously borrowed five yuan from him. On that day, he and two others who were at large demanded repayment from him at the scene of the incident. Wang said that Shi's job at the pharmacy, where he earned a monthly salary of seven yuan, was due to Wang's recommendation and refused to repay the debt, even uttering harsh words. Shi, in a fit of anger, used the ropes with the others to first tie his hands and then strangle his neck. He only intended to scare him, but Wang said that if he wasn't killed, he would beat them to death in the future. He then punched Wang in the waist until he died, then dumped the body in the nearby latrine. Chen Wu testified that her husband's name was Chen Zifang. On the day of the incident, she was cooking dinner when she heard the deceased and Shi arguing about debt outside her house in the third alley. Three days later, her husband told her that Wang had been murdered by Shi, and when she asked how he knew, her husband said that Shi had told him. But she and her husband were afraid, so they moved to Shenjiatan. Shi then claimed that the deceased's original surname was Lu and that he had committed a crime and changed his surname to Wang. Judge Feng reviewed the testimonies and ordered Chen Wu to be released first, but she was not allowed to leave Shanghai. Shi was detained pending a scheduled sentencing.</p>

At the time, people in the teahouse thought Gao was just playing with the child and didn't suspect anything. Later, they heard the child crying loudly and asked what was happening. The child, being young, didn't understand and only cried about the pain in her lower body. People called the child's mother, Wang Zheng, who discovered that the child's genitals were swollen and realized that she had been raped by Gao.

<p>Actively Pursuing Shipping Business in China</p>
<p>Shanghai Ship Ticket Prices Soar</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Dalian Steamship Company in this port has been taken over by the South Manchuria Railway due to the implementation of new policies. For a time, there were rumors in society that it would be dissolved. However, it is not known that the Japanese have always held the ambition to take every inch in China's shipping industry. The company is now at the start of its upturn in business so it would rather not give up its shipping rights in China. The details I have heard of the factual situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Changing the Name: Dalian Steamship Company was founded with the capital of the South Manchuria Railway. Currently, it has five routes: Andong, Yingkou, Tianjin, Shanghai-Dalian, Dalian-Japan. There are more than 30 ships in total. The Shanghai route is the most developed. This time, the South Manchuria Railway will be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Railways. The method is to abolish the head office of Dalian and change it to the Shipping Department, while the outer shops will remain in operation as usual.</p>
<p>There will be no change in business, but there will be a change in name. It was heard yesterday that the company received a message from the South Manchuria Railway that it may be renamed the Shanghai Branch of the South Manchuria Railway Shipping Department. At the same time, it is also planned to retain the words "Dalian Steamship Company" and attach them to the name of the firm so that passengers and cargo owners will not be misled and is being discussed.</p>
<p>Setting up a Branch in Hong Kong: During this change of management, the shipping industry is still taking an active attitude. As the newly built ships will all be completed before September, the planned opening of the South China route will also be before September. Therefore, it is currently preparing to set up a Hong Kong branch to manage the ship schedules, passengers, and cargo in the South China ports. The branch manager has already been sent out and will be able to come to Shanghai from Dalian and transfer to Hong Kong soon.</p>
<p>Ticket Prices Rise Again: The Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian ticket price of the company has already been raised once. Yesterday, another telegram was received from the Dalian head office stating that the price of gold is increasing day by day, so all cabin classes will be increased by another 20% starting from July 1st. The new prices are as follows: Shanghai to Dalian: First class was originally 60 yuan, then increased to 72 yuan, and will increase to 90 yuan on July 1st. Third class was originally 15 yuan, then increased to 18 yuan, and will increase to 22 yuan on July 1st. Shanghai to Qingdao: First class was originally 42 yuan, increased to 50 yuan, and will increase to 60 yuan on July 1st. Third class was originally 10 yuan, then increased to 12 yuan, and will increase to 15 yuan on July 1st.</p>

<p>Nagasaki Maru Suspended for Repairs: The Nagasaki Maru of the Japan Mail Steamship Company was sailing from Japan to Shanghai when its machinery was damaged in the Goto Islands sea area. It was temporarily repaired at the time, which resulted in a one-day delay. After returning to Japan, it set sail from Japan on the 23rd, but its machinery broke down again in the Yellow Sea. It turned back to the Eastern Ocean and dared not sail, causing it to miss its scheduled trip yesterday. A telegram was received from the head office stating that the ship has entered Dahan for major repairs and will not be able to sail until July 7th. All cargo and passengers on that ship have been ordered to be transferred to the Shanghai Maru on the 27th, and the Nagasaki Maru will be temporarily suspended for two weeks.</p>
<p>Wanliu Wheel Hits Reef: Taikoo Company's upper river steamer Wanliu was suspended from sailing in Shanghai due to the upper river workers' strike until May. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Yichang stating that the Wanliu hit a reef 45 miles downstream of Chongqing on the 22nd of this month. River water had entered the cargo hold, and the bottom of the ship had also been breached, making the situation quite dangerous. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's upper river steamers Yunyang Maru and Peiling Maru happened to be passing through the area on their way from Yi to Yu and have now stopped to help with the rescue. It is reported that all passengers on the Wanliu have been rescued. After receiving the news, the company ordered tugboats to be dispatched from Yichang and Chongqing to the accident site to help unload the cargo. The British Navy on the upper river also sent a ship to protect the site to prevent bandits from looting.</p>

<p>Since its founding in the winter of the 17th year, the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company has purchased more than ten acres of land at Gaolang Bridge, Huade Road, to build a factory and install all the equipment. The layout is very complete. The printing and dyeing of various flower labels, satins, linen yarns, wool silk fabrics, Dantanshi Lin patriotic cloth, etc., are all striving for perfection. In April and May, the purchase of machines has significantly increased the production rate, with an average daily output of more than 3,500 pieces. The general manager of the company, Mr. Zhang Rongchu, convened a meeting of the directors, who believed that the company's operations were very promising. However, silk products, which account for a portion of sales in the printing and dyeing industry, were still lacking, and the profits of the printing and dyeing industry were still leaking overseas. Therefore, it was proposed to add silk machines and other ancillary equipment to ensure that the products would be all-encompassing, so as to achieve the goal of truly resisting foreign goods. In addition, in order to expand the scope of business, the company's board of directors decided to continue to raise 250,000 yuan in stock. In addition to the 150,000 yuan subscribed by the directors, the remaining 100,000 yuan will be reserved for shareholders to publicly subscribe before convening the shareholders' meeting. It is reported that those from all walks of life who are interested in this industry can also subscribe.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Preparatory Meeting for the Reorganization of the Shanghai Paint Industry Association <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Paint Industry Association held a preparatory meeting for reorganization at the association's premises at Xue Lane at 2 PM the day before yesterday. More than 20 people attended. The documents were reported by Min Xingchu, who reported the purpose of the meeting. Ni Fusheng was publicly elected as the chairman, and Xiao Peisheng, Du Gengsheng, Zhang Shanjin, Pan Pingsan, Zhang Fukang, Zhang Youshui, etc., were elected as standing committee members. The remaining eight people, including Xu Shunrong, Xu Shuitang, and Wang Shengcai, were all executive committee members. The following proposals were then discussed: (1) Ratification of the appointment of Du Gengsheng, Zhang Fukang, Zhang Shanjin, and Zhang Youshui as representatives to attend the Business Reorganization Conference. Resolution passed. (2) The official establishment date of the association. It was resolved to complete the membership list and revise the regulations and articles of association before July 10 of this year in order to officially report to the party and government agencies to send personnel for guidance. (3) Those colleagues who have not yet completed their application forms are required to submit them to the store by the deadline. Those who fail to do so will be deemed to be deliberately resisting the resolution and will be submitted to the Social Bureau for sanctions. Next, the documents were reported by Min Xingchu, who reported the various procedures for handling the association's affairs. In fact, most of the paint industry colleagues do not understand the matter. For this registration, there were as many as four or five circulars, but they were ignored. As Mr. Wang Xiaolai said at the Business Reorganization Conference, the first step in reorganization is registration, but registration is an innovation in this city's merchants, so many people do not take it seriously. Second, organizations that are not legally organized should be transformed into legal entities. Those with the same nature should be merged, but those who have been accustomed to letting go in the past are now seriously implementing it, and there will inevitably be some difficulties. I am really exhausted and exhausted in the reorganization and registration of this association, and there are no achievements to record. Please ask all the gentlemen present to elect another virtuous person to assist in the progress. Everyone agreed and publicly elected Mr. Zhang Fukang as a member of the Paint and Woodenware Industry Reorganization Committee. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>The Jing'an Temple area in West Shanghai is a prosperous commercial area with a large number of residents, especially laborers. The area lacks an epidemic prevention hospital for relief. Many members of the Jing'an Temple Board of Directors and the Business Federation, as well as party member Gong Yifei, have recognized this and initiated the organization of a temporary hospital near the Jing'an Temple. A large building has been located for the hospital site, which is named the Jing'an Epidemic Hospital. It will engage in prevention, rescue, medical treatment, and dispensing medicine so that patients can receive nearby treatment. The hospital is currently raising funds from all walks of life.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Hu Puan Promotes National Martial Arts Ma Xieguo <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Since taking office this spring, the Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, Mr. Hu Puan, has been striving to improve internal and external affairs. Therefore, the Civil Affairs Department has the most proposals at each meeting of the Provincial Government. Mr. Hu used to be a professor at various universities in Shanghai, enjoying himself with books and also studying Xingyi and Bagua boxing, which he considered to be normal. After taking charge of the government of Jiangsu, he has been busy with official duties and has no time to sort out ancient books, but he has never interrupted his practice of boxing. Yesterday, I met with a friend who told me in great detail about Mr. Hu's recent situation, so I recorded it to share in this column.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Puan is from Jing County, Anhui Province. His residence is in Yuntaishan, Zhenjiang South Ma Road, my hometown. The scenery there is excellent and the decorations are quite elegant. Every morning when the sky is slightly bright, Mr. Hu must first practice Bagua boxing for several sets on the hillside road to cultivate his body and mind and absorb fresh air. At 7 o'clock, he goes to the Civil Affairs Department to teach boxing until 8 o'clock. Those who join include the section chief of the Secretariat and section members, totaling fifty people, divided into elementary and advanced levels. The elementary level is taught by Mr. Liu from the National Martial Arts Hall, while the advanced level is taught by Mr. Hu himself. Except for Sundays, when there is a routine rest, there has never been any interruption. It is heard that Mr. Hu also serves as the director of the Jiangsu Provincial National Martial Arts Hall. A few days ago, he discussed with Mr. Ye Chucang, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, to continue running the second phase of the women's training class in the National Martial Arts Hall, mainly to eliminate bad habits and develop women's physical education. Both Mr. Ye and Mr. Hu are enthusiastic about promoting national martial arts and are planning for the balanced development of physical education for both men and women.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Meeting of the Commercial Readjustment Committee Convening Representatives from Various Industries <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Reported by Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Since the National Government's Ministry of Industry and Commerce revised the Chamber of Commerce Law, chambers of commerce across the country have reorganized accordingly. On the 21st of this month, the Shanghai Commercial Readjustment Committee convened a conference of representatives from all industry guilds in the city to elect executive and supervisory committee members in accordance with the new Chamber of Commerce Law, thereby establishing the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This meeting has garnered attention from chambers of commerce nationwide. Therefore, despite the tediousness, we have recorded the details omitted by other newspapers as follows:</p>
<p>Attendance and Verification: To ensure solemnity due to the presence of over 300 members on this day, the committee issued attendance certificates in advance, detailing the guild name, representative name, and assigned number. The certificates were stamped, and the number matched the seat number in the venue. Members were required to present the certificate upon arrival, after which they were issued a badge and printed materials such as the agenda.</p>
<p>Overview of the Venue: The venue was located on the second floor, with seating arranged in three rows and fourteen columns. Each long table had nine seats, covered with a white tablecloth and equipped with natural ink, blotter, notebook, a writing brush, a pencil, and a teacup. A horizontal banner with golden characters on a red background hung above, and a table in the center served as the chairman's platform. Representatives from various agencies were seated beneath the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, while the recording staff sat to the right of the platform.</p>
<p>Badge Identification: The badges issued by the committee on this day were all made of ribbon, approximately five inches long, and featured the emblem of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. They were available in three colors: light red, dark red, and natural color. Light red badges bore the words "Presidium," dark red badges read "Member Representative," and natural color badges indicated titles such as "Master of Ceremonies," "Recorder," "Discipline Officer," and "Receptionist," worn on the chest.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Busy Schedule: Wang Xiaolai, a standing committee member of the Commercial Readjustment Committee, served as one of the members of the presidium on this day. He delivered the opening address in a loud voice, reminiscent of his portrayal of Yao Qi in the "Caoqiao Pass" opera. During the discussion of the regulations, photography was done in advance. Due to the large venue, the speaker was photographed from the stage, and two more photos were taken of the representatives from the left and right sides of the stage. All matters related to light and exposure were directed by Mr. Wang, who was seen running around busily.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing's Absence: The name Yu Qiaqing is known to all, from women and children, with a knowing smile... --Haiket</p>
<p>A: What have you been up to lately?</p>
<p>B: I've been extremely busy these past few days. I haven't had a moment to spare, barely even enough time to eat.</p>
<p>A: The capable are always busy, that's for sure. But what exactly are you so busy with?</p>
<p>B: I'm busy looking for a decent job because I've been unemployed for quite a while.</p>
<p>Father: Students at school often give each other nicknames. What's your nickname at school, son?</p>
<p>Son: They call me "Grass Roots."</p>
<p>Father: That's a rather peculiar nickname. Do you know what it means?</p>
<p>Son: Because I always rank at the bottom of the class in every exam, and grass roots are always at the bottom too.</p>
<p>A: Who are the greatest people in the world?</p>
<p>B: Barbers.</p>
<p>A: Barbers are considered a lowly profession. How can you call them the greatest people in the world?</p>
<p>B: Don't you see? No matter how high and mighty the important figures of the world are, they all have to bow their heads under the hands of a barber.</p>
<p>He is also a standing committee member of the Commercial Readjustment Committee. His absence on this day was a surprise to many. It is believed that Mr. Yu, due to his extensive public service, was concerned about being elected as an executive committee member due to his exhaustion. Therefore, when the shipping guild nominated representatives, he instructed his son, Shunmao, to take his place, withdrawing himself from consideration. He not only abstained from attending on this day but also relinquished his eligibility for election.</p>
<p>Busy Hands, Steady Feet: There is an old saying in China, "busy hands, chaotic feet." On this day, the meeting started at 9:00 AM and lasted until 6:00 PM. The representatives sat still for six hours, rendering their feet useless. A full course meal was served at noon and eaten at their seats to save time. They ate and discussed simultaneously. During voting, they had to put down their knives and forks to raise their hands. When electing executive and supervisory committee members, they had to personally fill in the names of the candidates. Thus, the work of the hands and feet was vastly different on this day.</p>
<h3 id="e96">In Memoriam: Mr. Cheng Dihua, Renowned Proofreader of Shanghai <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>By Ling Shanqing</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng had served as a proofreader at the Great Eastern Book Company for nearly ten years. His scholarly achievements were considerable, and he was diligent in his work. Mr. Shou Juan even referred to him as the "King of Proofreading." Unfortunately, he fell from a building and died on the 8th of this month, a great loss indeed. That day was a day off. Mr. Cheng returned to his residence in the late evening, slightly inebriated. He went upstairs to bed. Around 10:00 PM, a colleague in the next room heard the ringing of the bell in the workshop. Feeling strange, he crept over and saw Mr. Cheng lying near the staircase after falling. He quickly called for help. However, due to concussion and cerebral congestion, Mr. Cheng passed away suddenly. The rope of the bell hammer was attached to the handrail of the stairs. It is presumed that Mr. Cheng grabbed the rope while falling, but his grip failed, causing the bell to ring. Yesterday was the day of Mr. Cheng's funeral. I hereby compose two elegiac couplets in his memory:</p>
<p>First couplet: "Confined in a pharmacy like a dragon, a tipsy moment leading to an accidental fall, causing eternal regret; In a perilous building, riding the crane at midnight, hearing the alarm, most startling is the sound of a bell."</p>
<p>Second couplet: "Acquainted for twenty years, working together for ten years, admiring your extensive learning, I once asked you about rare characters; Surpassing sixty years of age, life ending in a moment, proofreading scriptures into a final masterpiece, Heaven mourning the loss of such a cultured man due to the fall."</p>
<h3 id="e97">Reading [The Vanguard Weekly] <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>By Yang Feiwo</p>
<p>As the National Revolution progresses, the new literature is declining. All that can be seen in the modern literary world are either classical literature of the aristocratic class singing loudly or proletarian literature shouting with all their might. What we feel is disappointment and sorrow, lamenting the decline of both new and old literature. Unexpectedly, in the disappointing and sorrowful declining modern literary world, we are able to obtain unexpected dawn. How should we cheer and celebrate?</p>
<p>I have long heard that the Nationalist literary movement is actively progressing with effort, and their publication came into being on the 22nd of this month. Although in terms of quantity, it is only a four-page newspaper size, which seems to be very weak, but upon investigating its content, it can already express their mission, enthusiastic and brave spirit, and it really has the spirit to save the decline of Chinese literature.</p>
<p>The inaugural issue of Vanguard has a total of seven articles, including [The Decline of Chinese Literature], [The Relationship Between Nationalism and Literature], [Mr. Lu Xun's Foresight], [The Way to Make Money Qian Xingcun], [The So-called Slaves of Doctrine], [Charms and Sorcerers], and a launch speech. In the two articles [The Decline of Chinese Literature] and [The Relationship Between Nationalism and Literature], the path to saving Chinese literature is revealed. Old literature has declined, and new literature has not been able to completely fall. We must not allow it to decline. If we are going to not have it naturally, we should muster an enduring spirit and work hard on the literary revolution, that is, work hard on the nationalist literary movement and walk the bright road we should take. After reading these two works, we may be able to understand the correct theory of literature and recognize the way out for Chinese literature.</p>
<p>At the same time, in addition to promoting their theory, [The Vanguard] also reveals the true face of Proletarian writers as much as possible. In the four articles [Mr. Lu Xun's Foresight], [The Way to Make Money Qian Xingcun], [The So-called Slaves of Doctrine], [Charms and Sorcerers], we can understand what the Proletarian writers were like. This is their characteristic and their spirit. The article [The Relationship Between Nationalism and Literature] clearly states [It is not permissible for anything that is bad or harms the nation, no matter which class it belongs to, the Nationalist literature must be conscious of and reject it] [In short, Nationalist literature is literature that promotes the national spirit from the national position, is hopeful and powerful, and as for critical literature, it is literature that grasps the spirit of the times]. After reading this conclusion, we can better understand their purpose and spirit. The silent Chinese literary world and the declining Chinese literature has produced this new force in modern times. It is naturally the savior of Chinese literature, awakening the literary world to recognize the consciousness of their own nation.</p>
<p>News: The wedding of Mr. Wei Zhuyi and Ms. 眖君 is scheduled to take place on the 29th of this month in the auditorium of the Great China Hotel. The Ya Jing Society will stage a song and dance drama and a new drama, and the Ya Ji Society amateurs will perform Peking Opera selections such as "Cailou Pei Tuo Zhao," "Peng Sui Da Yan Song," the full version of "Hong Luan Xi," the full version of "Fenghuang Shan," and the full version of "Yu Bei Ting," all of which are excellent works (if any).</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Lingering Flower Shadows; Fine Garden Gathering, Tasting Tea, Viewing Beauty</p>
<p>Afterwards, Zuo Shichen asked Ruiyun for another photo as a memento. Ruiyun said, "Didn't I have several photos taken at the Mingjing Photography Studio with you? Then she immediately changed her tone and said, "Okay, I'll go take some tomorrow. Do you want a full-body or a half-body?" Zuo Shichen wanted a half-body one. Ruiyun explained that she would go to Baoji Photography Studio tomorrow to take the photos. Several young sisters had asked me for photos, but I didn't have any of my own. She asked A Jin, "Is it better to have braids for the photo shoot tomorrow?" I believe braiding my hair makes me look older."</p>
<p>At this meal, Ruiyun didn't say much at first, but then she stopped being silent. Regarding her marriage, she preferred to marry a few years later, but she couldn't decide for herself. She believed that when she was at home in Nanjing, her body belonged to her parents. When the old woman Wang bought her to be a child bride, the ownership of her body belonged to the old woman Wang. When she was sold to the big aunt, who called her "mother," she became the big aunt's person. She had no choice but to do as she was told. As for the choice of a good man to marry, she had no say either. For example, when she was taken by the old woman Wang to be a child bride, her fiancé was much older than her and was the most annoying, naughty, and hateful person. If she hadn't been sold by the old woman Wang and had been forced to marry this most hated fiancé, it would have been something to be expected. Her heart was empty, and she had nothing to cling to. Although she was around men all day long, she said that she mechanically delivered a few platitudes in her essays and mechanically performed a few actions. For example, if someone wanted to kiss her face, her face would be stiff and the stinky beard would prick her tender cheeks. She could avoid it if she could, but if it was unavoidable and had to be carried out by force, she could only suppress her disgust, frown, and reluctantly let them relieve this hunger, as if singing a song in the hall meant she had the obligation to let them kiss her face for an unknown amount of foreign money. She felt that being forced was nothing. Although she was like a petal of spring, scattered in the hearts of men, she still did not have a lovely opposite sex. At the dinner party, there was a fleeting glimpse. She ran around fifty or sixty times a night, and by twelve o'clock, she was exhausted. A special express letter had already been sent to her pillow, urging her to go to the black sweet village. Tomorrow night would be the same. Many guests had already asked her to sing three or four times, but she still couldn't call out their last names. Fortunately, the adjutant A Jin had a strong memory. Her mind was a hall ledger. On the first day of the month, this guest asked Ruiyun to call him again on the fifteenth of next month, and A Jin remembered it clearly.</p>

<p>Golden Tide Overwhelming</p>
<p>Terrifying Bearishness, Prospects for Further Gains</p>
<p>Missing Invoices, Rare Peaks Emerge: Yesterday, the gold market once again experienced a turbulent and tidal wave. The rapid changes were unpredictable, with a fluctuating price of two to four taels. It seemed like madness. The day was filled with twists and turns, reaching seven taels, and new peaks emerged frequently, causing alarm. The barrier of 620 taels was once again breached. As for foreign exchange, the selling pressure seemed to lessen, but brokers were unsure of the standard. Consequently, transactions were conducted with caution, selling and buying alternately. Only Zhifeng Yong, Dada Cheng, Changsheng Yong, and others were slightly bullish, while Hengxing Yucheng Yongtaixing sold off. The market opened slightly lower due to the slight decrease in silver prices. Later, buyers became active, reaching 22 taels, but sellers appeared to be more numerous. With the decline in foreign exchange, the market turned weak, especially in the afternoon, breaking through 615 taels. Afterwards, buyers reappeared with agility, but the supply was scarce. Due to the high demand and lack of invoices, the market surged, surpassing the morning's high, reaching 622 taels and two cents. However, due to the lack of market on Wednesday, short sellers became extremely fearful. They were greatly stimulated and fear that a new high price will reappear in the future.</p>
<p>Opened high and then turned soft: Yesterday, the big invoices have dropped sixteen-thirds and the silver market has also reduced one-quarter. The August gold price opened at 618 taels, a slight decrease of eight cents. It then jumped up four taels, a total of twenty-two taels. However, sellers took advantage of this high price to sell, resulting in a five tael drop. When the first order was issued, the price was 17 taels and two cents. However, the listed price has been reduced by half of the price, a total of 125 US dollars, a reduction of 25. The price of gold rose one cent to eighteen taels and two cents. Then, because Hengxing and other companies sold, and the price of each exchange transaction was not tight, the price fell by one tael, for a total of seventeen taels. After this, Sumitomo and Zhejiang did the next month's Citibank at 35.9375 yuan, and someone entered the invoice, and suddenly rushed up three taels to 20 taels and 0.12 cents. At that time, HSBC and Zhejiang each did the next month's Citibank at 36 yuan. The people’s hearts were hit hard, and the price was about 18 taels and 12 cents around 10 o'clock. After more than ten minutes, the price rose more than one tael, which was bought by a certain speculator, so it was 19 taels and 8 cents. At 10:30, all the shops were sold out, and the people's hearts went down, and the market was tired, and the situation was getting worse and worse. There was a rise and fall of two taels until five taels before 11:45. Finally, it fell to 14 taels and five cents. Afterwards, there was a rise and fall of more than one tael until noon. The price was 15 and a half taels. It was possible to buy a tael of gold for 1 tael, 3 cents and 8 points. Also, the first order was 5 pence and 8125. The price was changed to 672 taels and 6 cents. It was estimated that the price was small. 54 to 55 taels to 56.7 taels.</p>
<p>At night, it hit 22 taels and 2 cents. The market opened at 16 taels and 9 cents. The items opened at 16 taels and 8 cents. After that, it went up to the clouds for a total of 17 taels and 8 cents. There seemed to be more sellers, so the price fell back by 2 taels to 15.78 cents at 3:00. After that, the head strips came to scramble to buy. Zhifeng Yong and others also followed and chased. It almost rose a thousand feet. The sharp market was so sharp that the suppliers were silent and avoided it. The people were panicking and the shorts were quickly replenished. The long side added code and all went the same way. It has already risen by six taels to another. Finally, it was pushed to 622 taels and 2 cents, but there was no market for drafts, so it was Tuesday. At the close at 4:30, it was estimated that the closing price of 22 taels was continuing to rise by 3 taels and 3 cents compared to the previous day. Check the maximum price of 22 taels and 2 cents in one day. The minimum price is 14 taels and 5 cents, which is 7 taels and 7 cents apart. The items opened at 18 taels in the morning, closed at 16 taels at noon, 6 taels and 8 cents in the afternoon, and closed at 22 taels. The listed price was still suppressed by 50 taels and the registration was 7 taels in July and 16 taels in August with a supplementary payment of 14 taels.</p>
<p>The entries and exits of each shop are not accurate. The transactions of each shop are estimated by Yuancheng Yong, Yuancheng, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, etc. Hengxing Yuankangxiang, Yucheng Yong, Taixing Yiyu, etc. are all sold. Zhifeng Yong, Changsheng, Dakang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng are all entered in the afternoon. Taixing Yuancheng, Hengxing, Wanxing, etc. are all out.

The Guang gang sold about 1,000 invoices.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Foreign Exchange Internally Weaker than Listed Price <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>

The previous market was tired and the rear market showed a new peak, rushing out of the 622 taels. The rise in the wind was unstoppable and almost reversed from two weeks ago. There was limited trade between Chinese merchants. Yesterday, the British gold turnover was 100,000 pounds, and each bank did tens of thousands of pounds of gold. The gold industry only had four or five thousand pounds in and out. The banking industry, such as Mitsui Maihang, entered. Shanghai Youli went out a little. Also, the recent US dollars were sold by Sumitomo, HSBC, Korean Mitsui, etc. Zhejiang Industrial and Zhongfu, etc. bought them, which were doing transactions for about two or three million yuan. The Japanese gold Chinese businessmen slightly sold the current period of tens of thousands of yuan, which was deposited by Mitsui Sumitomo. The market seems to be declining.</p>

The long-term has also been reduced by 1875 to 15 pence and 25 footings. China's small supply of sales is known. The market is flat and the New York telegraph has been received. The American silver price has also followed the sharp decline of 25 to 33 percent and 375 new low prices for spot goods. The daily US is still 49 yuan and 4375, and the British is still 2 shillings and 04375. The British to US is added 125 to 4 yuan, 8 corners, 6 minutes and 0625. The US to British is increased by 09375 for 4 yuan and 8 corners and 6 minutes. The British Shanghai shilling has fallen short of 25 for 1 shilling and 6 pence. It is estimated that the spot goods have been reduced by 4 ounces to 45 Robbie and 05 ounces. At 10:25 in the morning, the Reuters telegraph arrived and the daily US returned to a decrease of 0625 for a total of 49 yuan and 375. The daily US is still 2 shillings and 040625. The Telecom Agency came and still had no honor.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Unabated Rise in the Customs Tax Market <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday morning, at the market gathering, public sentiment seemed to indicate a softening trend in foreign exchange transactions. However, the bold supply of goods immediately led to a decline in market sentiment, with the general public believing that prices could be expected to stabilize. Unfortunately, this was far from the truth. The afternoon market suddenly surged again like a raging tide, with posted prices as high as four or five cents. Although suppressed, the surge was still about one cent. In short, the current shortage of spot goods and the increasing market demand make the rise in prices inevitable. Customs Tax Exchange Rates: (Foreign Customs Tax) The morning market was at 72.2875 cents, a decrease of 0.625 cents from the previous day's afternoon market. Unexpectedly, the afternoon market suddenly surged to 72.375 cents, an increase of 0.875 cents from the morning market, even reaching a high of 4.5 cents at one point. (Silver Customs Tax) The morning market was at 1.30 cents, a sudden decrease of 5 cents from the previous morning. The afternoon market continued to fall another 5 cents, resulting in a decrease of 8 cents. Overall, the morning market fell 1 cent from the previous day, indicating a softening trend. Bank postings started at 5 cents, but remained blank throughout, with no trading activity to speak of.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market: Jiangnan small silver dollars were at 63.6 cents in the morning market, a slight decrease of 0.5 cents from the previous afternoon. However, due to the lack of transactions, the price remained unchanged. Only 1,000 yuan were traded in the morning market. Guangdong small silver dollars further declined, entering the 60-cent range. The morning market was at 59.9 cents, and the afternoon market was at 59.95 cents, a decrease of 0.1 cents from the previous day's afternoon market. Odd-lot transactions amounted to 175,000 yuan in the morning market and 115,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Copper coin prices remained unchanged at 397,000 strings of cash.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday, banks did not receive many silver dollars, but settlements were relatively high. Chinese merchants received over 2.4 million in bills, foreign merchants received 1.45 million, telegraphic transfers amounted to 300,000, special withdrawals were 800,000, and settlements were 3 million.

Japanese banks received over 3.8 million in various receipts and shipped 400,000 into warehouses. Silver shops received over 5.1 million in single receipts due to the higher exchange rate of 25. Clearing house receipts were over 350,000, and remittances from various routes were over 120,000. Cash receipts were around 1 million. (Foreign Currency): Exchange bills amounted to 1.76 million in the morning market and 1.245 million in the afternoon market. There was no market for banknotes in the morning, but 13,000 were traded in the afternoon, along with 20,000 in Zhongshan new currency and 35,000 in Yuan currency. Off-market banknotes amounted to 144,000 in the morning and 220,000 in the afternoon. Spot foreign currency was 150,000 in the morning and 105,000 in the afternoon.

Foreign currency receipts from silver shops were over 7.4 million, and clearing house foreign currency receipts were over 1.9 million. Foreign currency borrowing and lending amounted to 1.9 million, and transactions among small money shops were over 600,000.</p>

<p>All Bonds Decline, with Demobilization and Disarmament Bonds Falling Most Severely</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock exchange activity was due to the approaching settlement period, with six-month futures no longer being traded. Preparations were being made for settlement, and trading in August futures was set to begin today. Therefore, only July futures were being traded, and bond prices fluctuated actively. Transactions were not quiet, but there were few spot transactions. The political situation took a turn for the worse, and market sentiment was weak. Various parties were selling off. Prices fell sharply at the beginning of the morning, and the decline slowed down slightly afterwards. As a result, disarmament bonds fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day, demobilization bonds fell by 2.5 yuan, tax bonds fell by 2 yuan, and reorganization bonds fell by a smaller amount of several jiao. Total futures transactions for the day were over 7.7 million, and spot transactions were 22,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Cotton Yarn Market Under the Influence of Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Japanese Yarn Reportedly Arriving in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the situation is not optimistic. Foreign cotton has softened, and large quantities of Japanese yarn are reportedly arriving. According to Nisshin Trading Company of Japan, 6,000 bales have been purchased in Hong Kong and 4,000 bales in Shanghai, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai within a week. The prices are more than ten taels lower than local yarn. Merchants from Sichuan and other inland provinces have been continuously purchasing large quantities. In the midst of this war and turmoil, the accumulation of stagnant inventory is a growing concern. Coupled with the invasion of cheap Japanese yarn, the future is truly bleak.</p>
<p>Standard Buying Interest Is Scattered, and Initial Prices Remain Weak. American Cotton Falls Again by 4-5 Jiao, and Major Bull Traders Are Closing Positions.

<p>American Cotton Telegrams Continue to Fall. Local Market Is Tight Due to Limited Inventory, and Hankou Merchants Purchase on Dips. Speculators Are Gradually Closing Positions Due to the Weak Yarn Market, But Fortunately, There Are Still Many Buyers Absorbing, So the Situation Has Not Softened. However, Spot Cotton Sales Are Sluggish, and Factories Are Inactive. Most Factories Have Sufficient Inventory, So There Is No Immediate Panic About Indian Cotton.</p>
<p>New Cotton Rises, Old Cotton Falls. Hankou Standard Cotton: The Market Opens Weak in the Morning Due to Poor Foreign Cotton and Bull Traders Closing Positions, But Some Buyers Are Present.

<p>Various Perspectives on the Grain and Flour Market Downstream</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market unanimously softened again in both the morning and afternoon for all months. While this reversal from rise to fall was partly due to the terrible drop in foreign wheat prices (Chicago fell to a minimum of 8.8 jiao, a further drop of about 1.23 yuan from the previous day), the biggest impact was actually the unusually abundant harvest of new wheat in the northern provinces this year. Currently, Tianjin has no market for Shanghai flour due to unsuitability, and local factories are fully supplying the demand. If this trend continues, the factories' sales channels will inevitably be hit unexpectedly. As a result, factories have been dumping their goods more actively, and external bulls are also gradually withdrawing, causing the market to fall step by step in all months. As a result, this month fell by another 1.75 fen compared to the previous day, July fell by 2 fen, August fell by 2.25 fen, September fell by 2.25 fen, October fell by 2 fen, and November fell by 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Spot Wheat Increases Bidding Again <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Futures Near Steady, Distant Months Weaker</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market this month saw rising sentiment as customers replenished their positions, while the distant months were weak due to low prices of foreign wheat. If sluggish sales continue, the market may remain weak. As a result, this month was better by 4 fen compared to the previous day, August remained unchanged, September was down by 1 fen, and October and November were down by 2 fen. Spot wheat, with factories taking a wait-and-see approach, continued to increase bidding again, and all grades were down by another 5 fen. High, You, Shao, Yangzhou, Shishan, Penglai, Chongming, Jinpu Railway and other new and old wheat totaling over 13,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Foreign Rice Flat in the Morning, Rises in the Afternoon <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice saw a weak trend before the market opened due to the arrival of new shipments and several more ships expected to arrive within one or two days and at the end of the month. Subsequently, the market turned better as local inland and Zhejiang merchants actively purchased, with total transactions exceeding 20,000 bags. Sentiment improved, and merchants from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo competed to purchase, while Hunan Changsha also made purchases, causing prices to rise by 1 jiao. Transactions included 3,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon, 4,000 bags of No. 2, 5,000 bags of small broken rice, 4,000 bags of large broken rice, 2,000 bags of end-of-month delivery, 1,000 bags of Kergay rice, 1,000 bags of Min Dang rice, and 3,000 bags of small broken rough rice for end-of-month delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Rice Market at Hexia Is Virtually Stalled <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Due to Unfinished Registration and Appraisal Procedures</p>
<p>Yesterday, ship cargoes were very scarce in Shanbei, with only a few shipments. Rice ships undergoing registration could not be appraised due to the absence of some cargo owners from Shanghai. At the same time, rice shops registered their purchases separately at the association for fair distribution, so that the prices could be determined and allocated for transport to Beigeng tomorrow. The decision was made to handle top-grade cargo at the maximum price of 21 yuan. As a result, all procedures were not yet completed, and the transaction of both Keng and Bo markets was virtually stalled throughout the day. Only Biangeng saw minor transactions, with no significant gains or losses.</p>
<p>The Keng rice market at Hexia in South Shanghai still saw no arrivals, and only a few top-grade Bo rice shipments were available. Transactions were mainly dominated by foreign rice. All very fine Yangjian rice and Tongbiangeng rice were sought after due to their scarcity. The overall market remained firm, with top-grade Yangjian reaching 20.05 yuan and top-grade Biangeng around 20 yuan. Reports from the railway indicate that the market prices in Suzhou and Wuxi are also tight, making it difficult to establish connections with the local market for the time being.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: New Factory Replenishes American Positions</p>
<p>The silk sales in Lyon still show no improvement, and the New York silk telegrams are also scarce due to the shrinking exchange rate. The market atmosphere is bleak. Yesterday, only Jianlebi and others imported 40 bales of medium-grade new factory silk, and Xinfu imported 10 bales of white heavy silk. Prices remain firm, and all transactions are for replenishing short positions.</p>
<h3 id="e107">New Changtu Opening Prices Show a Decline <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the pace of silk sales in Europe and the United States has been sluggish. Although French firms once dumped purchases after the new silk season began, the needs of Marseille could not support it. The new plate for silk factory Changtu once opened at 194 taels, but the market was not smooth and the price was expected to fall. Yesterday, Xinfu imported 30 dan at a price of only 186 taels, a drop of 6-7 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Decline in European Sales of Zhenmei Green Tea <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Zhenmei tea, a major product among green teas, has suffered a continuous decline in European sales since the new tea season began. Recently, although small amounts of high-grade tea from Gaoshuang in northern Wuyuan County have been sold upon arrival, the quantities are insignificant and do not affect the overall situation. A substantial inventory of 30,000 boxes from Tunxi, Suian, Shexian, and other regions has accumulated. The sluggish sales of Zhenmei tea are unprecedented in recent years. Yesterday, it was reported that Zhenmei tea from Tunxi had already entered the interior market at 100 taels. The decline of the market is evident. However, there is news that the head manager of the Xiezhuhui will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th. If Russian firms actively start procuring Zhenmei tea, the declining trend in the market might be reversed.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Sluggish Trend in Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Local fabric merchants have completed their purchases. Due to the busy farming season in the inland areas and the soaring rice prices in recent days, demand has become weak and cautious. Yesterday, 11-pound coarse cloth fell by 5 fen, and 9-pound cloth fell by 2.5 fen. Fine cloth has been able to maintain its price due to the availability of dyeing materials. However, 12-pound blue chicken cloth also fell by 5 fen. Only fine twill cloth has held steady, with Guangdong merchants actively purchasing various brands produced in Changzhou, almost exhausting the supply. Blue Double Fish cloth was traded for 150 pieces, while coarse twill cloth was rarely inquired about, and shipments are decreasing daily.</p>
<p>Soaring Gold Prices for Eastern and Western Piece Goods Make Imports Unprofitable</p>
<p>Those with ample capital continue to advance their goods. The Changsha and Hankou merchants in the textile trade are the most active, with about 1,000 pieces of tribute broadcloth being transferred to warehouses. Consequently, eastern goods have increased again. Double Child Deer is opening at 2 qian, 5 fen, and 7.5 li, while Mo Qianshan Wild Goose is consistently at 3 qian. Yuan Tribute Satin, Four Scholars, Tianlei, and Denggao are all selling for 2 qian and 7.5 fen. Pre-ordered fine broadcloth has gradually arrived in Shanghai, but holders are unwilling to sell it cheaply. Yesterday, Baoqiu opened at 2 qian, 9 fen, and 2.5 li, Huxinting at 2 qian, 5 fen, and 7.5 li, and Gucheng Society must have 3 qian. Western goods released profit-sharing Yian Nian Tribute Broadcloth yesterday opened at 2 qian and 3.5 fen. Hankou merchants traded 50 pieces. Yuan velvet has been heavily invested in by merchants along the street.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds - New Crop Shows Deficiency</p>
<p>Recently, due to news of a poor harvest of the new crop of black melon seeds, market prices have gradually increased. Top-grade seeds have already increased by 2.5 taels, while medium and lower grades have also increased by 1 to 2 taels. Production areas such as Henan Province are expected to have scarce production due to war, and Xuzhou has also suffered from flooding, making a good harvest difficult. There are also reports of a poor harvest in Jiangxi Province. Therefore, the market is moving towards a favorable situation. Yesterday, 100 bags of Yangshansizi were offered at 11 taels and 6 qian, slightly higher than before. Additionally, 200 bags of Haozhou peach seeds were offered at 8 taels, showing a stable trend.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Dali Sugar Releases 30,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, market reports from sugar-producing areas indicated that the current sugar price in Cuba remained at 1.25, with New York futures for September at 1.35, rising by 1 fen. Other months showed no changes. The current sugar price in Java was 9.00, rising by 1.25, with no changes in futures. Public associations' transactions in raw and white sugar were scarce. Deliveries are still tightly priced at 7 taels and 9 qian, with slight transactions. It is rumored that those who have financed the import of raw white sugar intend to release their stocks, suggesting a potential price drop. Medium white sugar and other types saw little trading. Yesterday, Dali Factory offered 30,000 bags of July-August Japanese sugar at a price of 4 yuan and 9 jiao per day of gold. The current sugar market situation appears weak, with prices slightly declining. YT brand was priced at 8 taels and 3 qian, YP brand at 8 taels and 5 qian, and YRO brand at 8 taels and 2 qian, lacking buyers. The sign board of the Zhenxiang Company offered 1,600 bags of Cuban foreign sugar at 7 taels and 2 qian, which was considered quite popular. (Note: The previous day's offer price was 7 taels and 3 qian, but the actual after-hours price was 7 taels and 2 qian.)</p>

<p>Arts and Culture</p>
<p>Literature and Art and National Consciousness by Ying Peng</p>
<p>Recently, some colleagues have been working hard to awaken [national consciousness] through literature and art. This has given rise to a strong vitality in contemporary literature and art, and it is inevitable that it has aroused resonance. Now, I will publish some of my usual notes on national consciousness and literature and art. Of course, these notes were written without a precise system, so I can only publish them here day by day. I plan to organize them into a complete piece when I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>If one is not clear-headed when discussing the nationalist literary movement in China, one will certainly misunderstand it as [preserving the national essence]. This is indeed a great mistake. Not everything in China can be called [essence]. Most of it may be [dross]. The literature and art created by Chinese intellectuals are nothing more than the expression of three kinds of thought: a desire for fame and wealth, a pessimistic view of the world, and a belief in fate. All three of these are centered on the individual and have nothing to do with the nation. Such thoughts should be extremely rejected from the standpoint of the nation.</p>
<p>The period of the feudal system in Chinese history was too long, perhaps because the organization of Chinese feudal politics was more complete and precise than that of Europe. As a result, the philosophy of yin and yang and the five elements and the doctrine of the mean became the center of Chinese culture. The outlook on life applicable under the feudal system was to cultivate oneself, regulate one's family, govern the state, and pacify the world. This was clearly positioning oneself in the position of ruler and controller, so all culture under the feudal system was fundamentally not national culture.</p>
<p>The organization of the Chinese family system was indeed initially based on the spirit of the nation, but because of the match of feudal politics and the assimilation of rationalist philosophy, it became a deformed and morbid development. As a result, the narrow patriarchal social organization became increasingly strict, and its foundation became increasingly solid, while the national spirit disappeared instead. Therefore, the [way of being a person] for educated Chinese people, outside of the family, was either the individual or the world. The so-called clan consciousness only had a momentary manifestation when oppressed by foreign races, but it would disappear again after a very short period.</p>
<p>China has undergone several conquests by foreign races, but the national consciousness still has considerable reserves among the people. Although the form of government has been reformed since the Xinhai Revolution, feudal forces remain consolidated. In particular, those in power absolutely ignore the thoughts, actions, organization, and hobbies of the people. They continue to prohibit folk entertainment and gatherings, and they continue to suppress folk songs and legends. Those who study folklore mistake it for ethnology. Those who study folklore do not focus their research on [national consciousness] and do not think about how to excavate the treasure of [national consciousness] hidden among the people. This is truly strange. Of course, Chinese folk entertainment or gatherings, folk songs or legends, inevitably still contain some remnants of escapist thought and feudal thought. However, relatively speaking, such elements are certainly less in the works of the so-called scholar-officials. We should stand on the point of the national spirit and carefully dissect and distinguish, taking what is useful and discarding what is not. In this regard, we must not dismiss everything with a single stroke, otherwise we will be destroying our own national spirit.</p>
<p>We have seen great evidence of the [national consciousness] contained in folk thought from the secret societies of the Jianghu, from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, from the Boxers, and from all the movements of the Xingzhonghui. A seed of [national consciousness] finally blossomed into the flower of the Chinese nation after drifting for a certain period and in a certain place. It is unimaginable that such a precious thing has always been buried and not heeded by intellectuals, and it is not yet heeded by intellectuals even now. [National consciousness] is collective, upward-looking, positive, striving, and creative. All of these are produced from the purpose of fighting for survival, fighting for freedom, and fighting for prosperity. Therefore, we see folk thoughts and actions, folk songs and legends, and everything else. If they have this nature, then they should of course be regarded as national treasures.</p>
<p>After thousands of years of oppression, the development of the [national consciousness] of the Chinese nation has undergone many difficulties and setbacks. The seeds buried among the people have not yet become widespread, and intellectuals, in particular, should have an urgent awakening.</p>
<p>The Complete Works of George Bernard Shaw by Kehua</p>
<p>The world-renowned seventy-three-year-old playwright George Bernard Shaw recently announced through his book dealers that a complete collection of his works will be published. The collection will be printed in thirty volumes, including all of his major works throughout his life. The first four volumes will be published in July of this year, and the rest will be published successively every few months. The entire collection will be completed by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The most valuable aspect of this complete collection is that it includes all of his earliest and most recent efforts. The first volume is his novel [Immaturity], written when he was twenty-two years old, which was rejected by various book dealers. He wrote a very long preface, explaining the circumstances of the book's publication in his best politeness. From this book, critics will immediately determine that the style of the seventy-three-year-old famous writer is incomparable to that of other immature literary authors.</p>
<p>This complete collection also includes Shaw's recent play [The Apple Cart], which has not only been successfully staged in London but has also been staged in other major cities. An even more interesting question is his collection of letters and pamphlets on the discussion of war. The publication of this book will surely be valued by collectors because it is the only purely uniform book of Shaw's works. This world-famous author has been living happily on his pen for forty years, and now his life's masterpieces are all contained in this complete collection.</p>

<p>After Seeing Fudan's Cyrano by Wen Juan</p>
<p>Fudan Drama Society has performed the famous French play [Cyrano de Bergerac] by Rostand many times. Although I am very fond of art, I am often frightened by a group of shallow and immature stage actions, so I have never had the courage to visit her resolutely. On the 19th of this month, when it was drizzling, Sister W came to me in a hurry to ask me to go to see Cyrano with her. I hesitated for a while, partly because I couldn't refuse her request, and finally picked up my raincoat and went to the New Central Theater on Haining Road. After receiving the program and reading it, I knew that the protagonist was still Mr. Ma Yanxiang, and I was very happy because my ears told me that Mr. Ma is a rare talent in the current drama circle.</p>
<p>The curtain opened. The costumes and actions of many knights were still not far from the script. Cyrano's appearance was like a red sun emerging from the clouds, making the whole scene more exciting. When Cyrano said, [Am I Monsieur 'No-You-Shall-Sing'?] everyone who was pointed at by his sword showed a kind of extreme fear. The few people standing at the foot of the stairs were so scared that they almost wanted to escape to the upstairs. These supporting roles were very well done. Also, when Cyrano and Valvert were fencing, Hawke's whole body in the box was trembling and his face was changing color. Although there were additional notes in the script, the actions at that time were not written clearly. These are all the careful points of the director that the audience should not ignore. There were so many people in the first act that I was initially very afraid that they would fail. However, the performance was still very satisfying. However, the flower girl's appearance was too devoid of drama and too forgetting that she was acting. The candy girl was much better, more natural and experienced.</p>
<p>At the end, Cyrano confided his thoughts to Le Bret. He said,</p>
<p>[I dream of having an arm to lean on, slowly walking in the moonlight. My thoughts are so excited that I forget all my worries, but suddenly I see my shadow appearing on the garden wall.] He walked and recited, and the expressions and actions of his face and body were sometimes affectionate and sometimes impassioned, ultimately ending in disappointed sadness. Not to mention that Le Bret in the play was moved by his words, even we in the audience were almost in tears. Later, when he accepted Hawke's promise, his surprise and confusion were also acted appropriately.</p>
<p>The second act was the pastry shop of the poet Ragueneau. Mr. Wu Shude, who played Ragueneau, was also very good. When those poets were reciting poems, his attitude of listening with his hands folded was very natural. He is a pastry chef and also a poet at the same time. This double-personality role is not easy to excel in, but his performance was very suitable for the personality of the character in the play.</p>
<p>Cyrano's infatuation and frequent checking of the time when writing letters were very profound. When Hawke said that she loved Christian, his disappointment and despair were truly sympathetic. However, this is not difficult. What is difficult is to restrain his emotions and resolutely agree to protect his rival in love. This great and sacrificial spirit can only be done by Cyrano, and our Cyrano on the stage can understand the hero's group of measures and great love in the play, making the audience feel that the person wearing a top hat and a cloak is really Cyrano. This kind of skill cannot be done by people with considerable literary cultivation.</p>
<p>Ms. Liang, who played Hawke, has a lot of help from her innate strengths. A kind of coquettishness of a spoiled young lady is very lovely. When there is a lack of female artistic talents, it is always rare and valuable.</p>
<p>The third act is the important performance of Christian. In the moonlight, our Hawke also appeared on the balcony like a fairy in the moon palace. All the dialogues were still good, but at the moment of the tragic farewell after the wedding, she seemed to lack expression too much. According to the script, when Hawke was holding onto Christian, urging Christian to leave, she rushed into Christian's arms and called Christian's name. However, she did not dare to do this, probably because she was shy. We should forgive her. As for Christian being dragged out and desperately struggling and sending her a kiss with his hand, it was very researched.</p>
<p>The cadet officer of the fourth act, Guasmai, can be said to be more humorous than sad. The drunkenness and starvation of many officers are quite funny. When Christian realized the failure of love and died, the humorous atmosphere changed to extreme sadness. However, Christian's disappointment and determination before his death were also acted very generously and passionately. Mr. Tang Yuanfan can also be regarded as successful. At this time, Hawke's expression still lacked tension. When a lover is injured and dying, how should one be sad and how should one be shocked? The script also has the phrase [I feel his face is cold against my face], so Hawke should at least hug him once or rub his face against him. However, she did not do this. Hawke has always lacked enthusiasm and courage from beginning to end. I don't know if it was the director's negligence or Ms. Liang herself was unwilling. Here, we can only keep it as a question.</p>
<p>Our Hawke in the last act was more experienced. She is probably a neurotic young lady who is suitable for acting in sad and quiet dramas. The way she was embroidering the veil and waiting for Cyrano can be said to have fully expressed all her feelings. Her facial expressions were also the best at this time. Cyrano came to say goodbye, his smile and his fatigue became more and more immersive. In the twilight of the fallen leaves and the vast nunnery, a widow wearing filial piety faced a dying old friend, and Cyrano, who combined the beauty of a poet and a swordsman, was a hero again.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>Republic of China, Year Nineteen</p>
<p>The late-blooming man endured the wounds of love and died momentarily. What a state it was. My tears were soaking the glass of my glasses, and I dared not look at the hero's situation before his death. How ridiculous I was! However, when Hawke discovered that Cyrano was the soul of Christian, whom she loved, there should be more twists and turns, and more actions, otherwise it would be too plain and somewhat inconsistent with the facts. I read the script carefully. When she said [That Voice!] it should have been [trembling], although this is considered a small flaw. Cyrano was about to die, and she covered her face and cried with both hands. This way of crying was very suitable for her status, because she was already a widow who had been living in the nunnery for a long time. The focus of the whole play was on this act, and it was also Ms. Liang's last successful section. As for Mr. Ma's Cyrano, it was impeccable from beginning to end. Sister Ai, who is very discerning in art, also said [Satisfied! Satisfied!]</p>
<p>The scenery of the whole play shows that the director has done his best. Except for some small details, it is always worthy of the original author. This overall costume and equipment probably cost the troupe a lot of money. However, when Hawke went out to the battlefield, she should have put on her hat and gloves.</p>

Big banquets, small drinks, famous snacks, porridge, noodles, stewed dishes, ice cream, and other seasonal foods are all available. Customers are often full because the food materials are carefully selected and hygienic, and the seats are especially clean and elegant. The owner often sees customers crowding and those who arrive late often have no seats, which is a pity for the lack of hospitality. Therefore, we have promoted the renovation of the entire seat on the rear building, which is completed during the day, and the north building can accommodate more than twenty seats.</p>

<p>Baixing Grand Theater announced that, starting today, in addition to screening the famous romantic film [Romantic Female Student] starring the famous American romantic actress Colleen Moore, the latest popular four famous songs will be added to each show: [Tearful and Praiseworthy Liwa], [Lijie], [Xuangong Yan Shi], [A Dream of Shanghai's Prosperity]. In order to give preferential treatment to the audience, the seat prices have been reduced to 6 jiao upstairs and 4 jiao downstairs, day and night.

<p>Shanghai Stage announced that the [Journey to the West] performed by the stage has been a household name since the first performance, and it has been praised as the leader of the stage in recent years. The protagonist, Gai Jiaotian, is famous for his short and skilled performances. In the first performance, he played the Monkey King, and his appearance and acting skills were very magical. His martial arts singing and acting were especially skilled. Those who have seen the first [Journey to the West] all said that the essence of [Journey to the West] is gathered in Gai Jiaotian, and that [Journey to the West] starring Gai Jiaotian has lost the essence of [Journey to the West]. Now, the second volume is also being performed. It is said that Gai Jiaotian still plays the Monkey King, and the performance singing is even more important than the first volume. The plot is also tortuous and worth seeing. The organs and colors are based on European and American stage scenery methods and use electric light heavily, so they are very realistic. In terms of actors, in addition to the original cast, Zhao Junyu has been added to play the role of Tang Seng.
