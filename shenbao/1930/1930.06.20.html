<p>時評</p>
<h3>各國之財政當局</h3>
<p>當此財政艱難之時。欲實行節縮。又不能不兼顧事業。欲顧全事業。則又不能實行節縮。於是政府當局。乃陷入困境矣。美國之新稅則案初亦未嘗不欲减輕稅率。以稍釋人民負擔。然其後爲事實所迫。不得不一改再改。遂致與初意相反。今之大遭國民與友邦痛擊。實亦無以自解也。德國之財政。亦甚困難。財政當局爲彌補預算。欲强徵薪俸捐。旣爲聯邦會議所反對。而以前所提之各辦法。又爲政府與黨所拒絶。以致失業津貼金。無法應付於是財政總長。不得不迫而辭職矣。英國之失業問題。爲英國最困難問題。工黨政府之救濟計劃。極盼保守黨諒解而予以援助。然而保守黨則仍力圖推翻。今日張伯倫在下院提出核减工部預算案。意即在推翻政府之救濟政策。雖經投票否决然保守黨思所以掣政府之肘。計固百出不窮。工黨政府之難關。實亦不易擺脫也。巴黎報載。法政府爲鄭重國防計。將在國會提出追加國防費十萬萬法郎預算案。當然爲法人極注意之事。今雖尚在秘密討論中。但一旦實現。議院中必難免一番爭辯也。</p>
<p>綜合今日之種種消息觀之。財政當局之難關。皆在預算。而預算中之最不易解决者。則爲失業與國防兩題。蓋失業之救濟費。爲目前最急之務。而國防之補充費。又爲新趨勢所不可少者。也</p>

<h3>中宣部招待新聞界</h3>
<p>中央宣傳部十九日下午二時招待新聞界、劉蘆隱主席、首報告各方軍事勝利情形、次謂目前重要問題不僅在戰事、還要從經濟建設下手、以確立和平統一基礎經濟進展到相當程度、叛亂的根源即可剷除到相當程度、大家不要存錯誤觀念、以爲國内有戰事、就不作經濟建設、尤應知道要消弭内亂的根源、更不能不一致努力於經濟的建設並云這個問題、季陶先生研究最詳盡、當介紹戴季陶報告、略謂關於這個問題、自今年元旦起、已發表過相當意見、近因金漲銀跌問題、前幾天曾在中央廣播電台發表一些意見、我們要知道一個的公經濟基礎是在私濟上面、國家財政是在國民經濟上面、因此無論從政治上或從社會事業上看、國家和人民所應取的方針、是一樣的、即目前軍事問題、政府應取的方針、與人民應負的責任、亦是相同的、現在論到國民經濟問題、大家應注意到常與變的道理、如果處常的主義政策能够認識清楚、拿得穩、到了變局發生、依準我們處常的主義政策去想出處變的方法、是不會錯的譬如我們以三民主義爲建國的經常大道能够認得清拿得穩、則一切事實上的變態亦自可應付裕如即就現在政治與軍事而言爲什麽中央要用兵呢、自從前年克復平津統一後、中央始終抱定和平統一的方針、並無用兵意思、而現在所以要用兵的、乃是因處置當前這一個變局因爲有些不明這理的叛逆、不肯向上、並且妄自尊大、不肯與中央同走正道、即常人所共由之路亦不肯行、自已亂跑、馮玉祥即一例證、前年馮到北平、蔣總司令和吳穉暉說了許多的話、費了很多工夫、兄弟沿途亦用盡方法、把他拖到南京來總想和衷共濟、同向和平建設的方面努力、但是人家走大道、他一定要走小路、不與人同、專求立異、而且什麽也不懂、只知道作草大王、所知道的、只有三國演義水滸七俠五義小五義等等、至世界國家如何、皆所不問、人家造鐵道、他偏要拆毁、人家講交通、他一定要閉塞、再說閣錫山、一定要向後走、不肯向前、即如正太路窄軌、經濟上很吃虧閻在前年政治會議中提案、還要造窄軌、仍是山西從前作票號生意人造成没奈何的腦筋而且没奈何還是保存在中國地下、他有欵子、却存到外國銀行裏去、人家把他的錢騙了、他亦没有辦法、這種眞是旣愚且憐了、我們要知道、中國的環境、祇有向上前進、方可存在、</p>
<p>剛剛有這兩個不學好、一個不向上的叛逆、此乃革命建國期問一個變態、我如不把這個變態打下去、常理即立不起來、民族國家就要隨着衰亂下去了、中央於前年統一之後、盡量委曲求全、爲使全國步調一致、把中國好好建設起來、但遇着此種變局是當有爲救國救民而下最大的决心、無論是怎樣的犧牲、要把民國的基礎扶植起來貪民歸於正道、這是用兵的原因、從經濟上看、金漲銀跌、亦是一種變態、十年以前、金價跌到二十換、亦一變態、由十年前看到今日、這種變態是很顯明的、我用簡單的看法、中國現在還是一個用生銀的國家、並無所謂貨幣、十年以前歐戰期間、歐洲用金國家經濟金融均告停滯、遂生一大變態、金子一步步的跌下去、即用金國亂象、現在中國國内到處空虚、各通商口岸尤其是租界地的銀子停滯、不向内地去、金融全不流通此乃一大變態、看了這兩個變態、（一）十年前的金價、歐洲各國在戰後很快的把工業生産恢復起來、財政幣制整理起來、經濟狀况通復原態、（二）現在要恢復經濟的常軌、挽回銀價的低落、一定要把市塲疏通、大家能多致力於内地生産發展、銀價市塲亦是很容易恢復的所以現在銀價慘跌、亦未嘗不是一種好機會能多剌激全國的人發生一個大的覺悟舶來品或因而减少、許多一切工商業界的人、乃至有錢的人、個個都認定方針、向内地投資興業的路走去、則變態由此即易治好、絶非用小小的調劑辦法所能好的、亦如閻馮之作亂、非可姑息所能解决一樣、第三點我們把政治軍事綜合起來看、現在中國之需要建設、乃爲天經地義造成、國民經濟組織之偉大計劃、即總理所著之實業政策、有幾件事須要儘先作好的、一定要全國人民擁護有力量的政府、才能作好、</p>
<p>即如一粤漢鐵路之接軌、以溝通長江珠江各省、二西南數省四面鎖住、一切皆無辦法、要把西南的大富源打通、即爲滇粤鐵路之建築、貫通西南數省、三由東南至西北的隴海路、第一步以蘭州爲終點、一定要趕快的完成、這幾條鐵路一通、内地人民工作才有經濟價值、外資才能得助内地開發、而内地貨物才可供給外邊市塲用途、人民生活才可解决、由是國民經濟建設才有基礎、我們要求統一、就是要作這些事、我們再看所謂叛軍是如何、現在最慘無天日者、莫如陜西、人口只剩了幾百萬、其有價值之生産、因爲不能交通之故、亦皆失了價值、前年國府决定了兩個方針、一是救急、即賑災、二是救窮、即開發國家的財源、政治上看亦是如此、所以當時我曾介紹很多的人到西北去、第一步爲幫助那些地方作起一些建設的基礎、第二步是扶持他們地方上的人自已起來作政治文化工作、與生産事業、但是馮對西北、其所取的方策、却偏要與吾人所講的剛剛相反、其一定要不讓外邊的人才和財力進去、我們要以東南財力開發西北、而他偏把他關閉起來、陜西的棉花價、祇十數元、上海則爲三十餘兩、如能交通、則陜省已很豐富、以此爲例、則可推知西北的窮困禍災、都是他居心立異的作法所造成的、所以美人調查、謂陜災乃人造的、不是天降的、人造的災便無法救濟、軍治政治金融皆是一樣的、希望言論界宣傳提倡、要使經濟界的人醒轉來、要知道各掃門前雪、是不能行的、如關起了上海市塲、不肯向内地投資、幫助政府建設、則亦與各處的蠻民不通文化無異、上海大埠如不以其力量向内地去發展、結果必致停滯而生變亂、則上海危矣、現在有些人不肯發心作慈善事業、但這些是消極的、力量很小、雖然我們也要作、但是還應該放大眼光團結力量去做各種生産事業、這才眞是救國救民的好事、如果拿出力量來到内地開發則利人利已、又能生利有人說是因爲内地不太平而不去的、這個理由、已不充足、是不能原諒的、歸納起來、一點是各處租界商塲地方的人要知道内地是我們的家鄕、不要忘記、要以財力帮助内地發展實業、帮助政府作經濟建設、政府現在盡力的、在想方法予以便利奬勵、二點是人民要一致團結精神帮助政府、很堅决的把這次戰事得到最後勝利、認清不向上不學好的兩種土匪、中國已經窮了如把土匪認清、使全國交通無阻、則一切皆會有辦法了、社會人民要肯定的帮助中央政治軍事之統一、方能樹今後和平之基礎、希望各位從各面宣傳提倡、使得内地有了辦法、則上海即有辦法、海外華僑很熱心的到内地投資、爲其祖國爲其家鄕努力於革命事業、而内地賺了錢到租界上去的人人不顧其家鄕、結果只見租界地方日見熱閙、内地日形蕭條、各種危機皆伏於此、必須内地好了、各處口岸商塲才可以好、在大體上此刻我們要注意、經濟變動、乃由經濟不發展而來、要使經濟發展、定要利用外資、即機器與技術、至其方法、即總理所謂操之於我者則存操之於人者則亡、希望各位注意、現在社會上還多不明白、無此勇氣與思想、總理所著中國之實業應當如何發展一文、要詳細研究、現在就此一點提倡宣傳、使人民全能明白、乃是救危機之一好方法、我個人將來有機會還要到上海去開導那各工商業家、更望言論界能够感化他、倘使能有如華僑之熱心則中國的經濟政治軍事都可以有辦法了、四時散會、</p>

<p>兇手之就捕當兇手走至樓梯口、即爲該樓之另一侍役所阻、馮乃將樓之侍役陳裕、推倒於地、狂奔下樓而遁、該樓之侍役覩狀、仍躡尾窮追、馮沿樓而下、及出門時、乃由太平路向北而逃、該侍役等仍躡尾追捕、馮乃由太平路逃入寶順街而出怡和街、卒由太平路及怡和街一帶之段警、恊同警長黃維法梁士衡等、及該樓侍役、將馮捕獲、拘返太平分局究辦、鞫訊之下、該兇供稱馮名聲、年二十一歲、南寗人、爲吕之衛隊、但不承認有剌吕情事、雖經該局再三鞫訊、馮仍堅不承認如故、乃由該分局將馮押留候辦、</p>
<p>要人之探問吕被剌後、即倒於該房、（即七一二號）該酒店之司理鍾明元聆耗後、以事體重大、乃分用電話、報告八路總指揮部省政府市公安局及太平路分局等、旋由太平分局派出大隊武警前往、將該酒店先行包圍、暫不准住客出入、至翌晨八時始散、陳濟棠陳銘樞歐陽駒等接該酒店電話後、即相繼聯袂至該酒店探問、但當時吕已奄奄一息、不能言語、</p>
<p>醫生之施救先是吕受傷倒地、被其家人發覺、急延醫生施救、先由住太平路之西醫生司徒朝陳耀佳何旭生等、到酒店救治、軍醫處各長員亦聞警馳至、協同援救、奈以傷勢過重、旋用汽車載往東山百子路中第一醫院療治、（即原日之公醫院）詎入院未幾、約五分鐘、吕即因傷重斃命、</p>

<p>設立治喪處吕氏在醫院逝世後、當由八路總部參議楊鼎中與該院接洽、借處辦理喪事、結果該醫院允借出醫院正座後樓之地下、爲吕府治喪辦事處、并在該處後便之空地搭棚停棺、昨午該辦事處門首、已貼出用白紙書成之「吕府治喪辦事處」長條、又該院頭門牆上貼有同樣長條、</p>
<p>兇手之身世剌吕之馮名聲、爲吕氏平日最親信之衛隊、馮爲南寗人、年少富有膽識、追隨吕氏已有數年、恒不離吕之左右、到處跟隨、惟據吕太夫人對該酒店人員云、兇手性情異常狡詐、作早已不欲煥炎僱用、但該兇手侍煥炎、則非常恭順、且人頗精靈、故他不忍辭退云云、又查吕住七一二號、除兇手馮名聲外、各衛隊非命令、不能擅進、則吕對於該兇手之信任可知、至兇手所用之行兇手槍、亦吕氏隨身自用之物、因吕不自携帶、故命該兇手携之、跟隨左右、誠不料該兇手即以此槍爲行剌其主人之具也、聞此手槍共有彈六顆、在房内地上拾獲時、見轟去一彈、尚存五彈在内、</p>

<h3>整理初等敎費</h3>
<p>革除虚收實支…增加敎育效率提高經費標準…穩定敎師生活「鎭江通信」江蘇敎育廳鑒於各縣初等敎育、以經費來源空虚、而事業伸張、復漫無標準、以致虚收實支積欠累累使敎師生活、發生恐慌、而事業亦將瀕於破産、受釐定整理辦法通令實行、兹錄其令文如下、</p>
<p>爲令行事、案查整理各縣初等敎育、曁高初級實騐小學中心小學經費支配標準並各縣編造十九年度敎育經費預算大綱、業經本廳分别令行遵照各在案、查本廳規定前項標準之原因、早於迭次訓令中詳爲叙述、誠慮或有未能悉解、兹復不憚煩瑣、重爲申明如次、</p>
<p>（一）經費爲事業之母經費不穩定、則事業亦等於空虚未流所及、必因事業之伸張、漫無標準、使經費之基礎從而動摇、名縣地方敎育、亦立即陷於萬劫不復之域、例如如臯、吳縣、等處、此弊最顯、蓋開支則錙銖無可减發、收入則來源未能盡持、虚收實支、作繭自縛、窮其究竟必致破産、故編製十九年度預算、自以收支適合爲第一要義</p>
<p>（二）敎育效率之原則、恒期以少數之經費、謀多數之效率、况處今日財政困窘之時、每個學生平均所佔之費、不得不力求其少、而每個敎師平均所敎之學生、不可不力求其多、本省各縣小學、每級學生人數僅一二十人者、所在而有、甚且有三五人者、而每級所用敎師、往往在一人以上、此與敎育效率之原則、顯相違背、故每級學生人數、及每級敎師之數、必須明白規定、意蓋在此、（三）此次規定之標準、經費數係按照各縣現支數目、酌量支配、初級小學最高限度、定爲三百五十元、已較第二次全國敎育會議議决之、「初級小學經費年額二百八十元」者爲增高、其高級小學實騐小學、中心小學等經費、悉皆斟酌情形、分别規定、期使全省悉能依此標準、推行盡利、（四）小學敎師負責至重、而待遇過薄、本廳亦肅焉憂之、顧以本省各縣經費狀况、旣如此支絀、國省兩庫、又復同此匱乏、各縣原有敎育事業、勢不能因提高敎師待遇、而中止進行、地方失學兒童則又如此之多、顧慮再三、始出此整理之計、一方則限制經費之浮濫一方力求敎師薪資之穩定、蓋此次所縮减者在維支各費、至敎師薪金、如果每級學生之數與標準相符、非惟不减、本廳第八五五號訓令、且明揭勞績加俸之恉意、期經此番整理之結果、苟使秋成不致過歉、收支庶可適合、各小學敎師之薪金、當不致更有遭逢不幸積欠累月之事、</p>
<p>（五）鄕村小學敎師與城市小學敎師待遇之比較、現今各縣恒失之平、實行鄕村小學敎師之使命、未必較城市爲小、其處境或反較城市爲艱、使不酌予提高、則去普及敎育之目的逾遠、故此次編造十九年度預算、鄕村與城市之待遇務期均等總之處此各縣敎育經費窘乏之時、與其徒事舖張、同歸於盡、不如綜核名實、忍痛須臾、庶幾財盡其用、人盡其才、學校盡其效、凡此亡羊補牢之謀、悉屬含苦茹辛之計、必使經費之有着、而敎師薪金始得穩定、而平均必免破産於瀕危、而敎育事業始可漸期其發展、仰由該局長迅將此令廣爲印發劉切說明、務使該縣小學校長敎員等、一一明瞭、併仰該縣十九年度預算、依限編造送核、是爲至要、此令</p>

<h3>會考珍聞俞劍華</h3>
<p>中國考試制度。由來已久。書曰。三載考績。三考黜陟幽明。禮視學疏。視學謂考試學者經業。是三代之時已有考試之舉。迨後唐以科目取士。宋用帖括。明清用八股。科舉之毒。乃深中於人心。故雖興學校。廢科塲。而考試制度仍然存在。五四以後。曾有廢止考試運動。然不久已寂然無聞。良以學校若無考試。則不但成績無從考查。而學校與學生兩方面。均覺散漫。無進取之精神。好逸惡勞。人之恒情。不受督催而能砥礪於學者。究無幾人。况年幼無知之學生。日以游戲爲事者耶。此次特别市敎育局毅然舉行初中畢業會考。於是各中學校。無不手忙脚亂。臨渴掘井。大抱佛脚。而三民主義問答。各科問答。百科常識。考試必讀等書。乃利市三倍。畢業生乃一變其欣欣喜色而疾首蹙額。手不釋卷。且開特别夜車。以期名列前茅。十六日爲會考之第一日。閘北學生會於横浜橋之廣肇中學。各校由師長一二人負責領導。余亦與孫翔仲先生送女弟子二十八人與焉。早八時至。已人聲喧闖。共分三樓十七試塲。學生六百餘人。男女生雜坐。率男多而女少。每室不過十之二三。八時半試黨義係測騐三十間。頗易。故未及半小時。已紛紛繳卷。卷上概不署名。以號數代之。十時半發午點。余更帶檯球板。於暇時拍球。可謂好整以暇矣。過午試國文。題爲學校生活的自述。尚易。惟有測騐題五。則未免過舊。而非現在一般初中學生日從事於白話文者所能盡知。因之錯誤百出（一）何謂四聲。（二）四子書究指何書。（三）漢書史記作於何人。（四）紅樓夢是否作於韓愈。（五）唐宋八家究指何人。學生只知四書而不知四子書因而不敢寫學庸論孟。而寫老子莊子墨子荀子矣。漢書多寫班超作。史記則有寫孔子作者。有寫司馬光作者。紅樓夢知爲曹雪芹作者固多、而不知者亦夥。於是黠者僅答以不是韓愈。一女生不知究竟。乃書是不是兩紙條。捻而抽之。得不是。遂書之。一生已答不是矣。繼思恐誤。乃將不字點去。及出塲問他人。遂懊悔而哭。唐宋八家之名知者亦不甚多。故不但一般學生。大感困難。而送考者亦爲之扼腕云。</p>

<p>畫展之設。雖非創舉。而今年之景象消沉。漫無生氣。殊令人惄焉懷國内藝術界有寂滅之憂者。銅山不崩。洛鐘胡應。然則關紫蘭女士個人之油畫展覽可不舉行也哉。關女士粤人。豐容盛鬋。不燕瘦。亦不環腴。舉止落落有大家閨秀風。與人接。如其畫。而忘其爲女性。日本某藝術家儗之曰牡丹花頗有見地也。女士擅洋畫。鳴於時者久。初卒業於中華藝術大學。爲畫師丁衍鏞先生入室弟子。卒業後東渡扶桑。努力精研。藝益孟晉。然一本師承。故盡得丁先生之神髓。且畫法作風。筆觸色調。亦絶似丁作。以是。當數年前關女士之作之展覽於儉德會時。嫉而譭之者曰。是丁者耳。何云乎關。關蓋不知畫者也。語鑿鑿。若持有左證然者。余聞之。睨以目。非以腹。語者慚。逡巡去。後見余。或談洋畫界諸子者。遂不敢再譭關。然亦不能已於於嗤以鼻。名高謗興。古人實不我欺也。今者。關紫蘭女士開其個人油畫展覽會於華安八樓。陳所作作品綜五十餘點佔室二。余於星期日午前驅車往。細雨如絲。凉意襲衣袂。旣至。乘電梯以登。簽名。入室。見關女士並名畫家陳抱一先生夫婦往來蹀𨇾。招待來賓。殊殷懃有摯意。余入室後。仰目以觀。按名而索。一一瀏覽眼生纈。心生慕。不期而出諸口者嘖蹟然。傍午。友人數輩亦聯袂來。相與鑒賞。全豹兩窺而猶不肯去。徘徊往復。愈覺如貧兒之初入寶出。爲勢應接不暇也。余語吾友。綜觀各點。遠邁前作。於此可知其努力精進。功候已深。而遒勁麤豪。大胆用筆。運用其跌宕天才。以簡約之絢爛色彩而抽出對象刹那之情緒。筆觸有力。無女性柔靡嬌娜之表現。女作家第一人也。友人曰。然。然其特殊個性。盡表現於果斷爽快之中。亦祗關女士一人已耳。至於寫生之取景調色。有特殊風致。尤足以使人見到關女士之所以爲關女士者焉。語已。相率出舍。雨絲風片。撲面凛然。歸後寫此以誌眼福。</p>
<h3>西湖大風記廉翁</h3>
<p>杭州西湖。本爲逭暑之所。近日天氣漸暖。依依楊柳。人喚渡船。容與中流者。必薄暮始返。甚有鶼鶼佳偶。盪槳月湖者。誠哉賞心樂事也。不意本月七日下午六時許。狂風陡作。走石飛沙。湖堤行人。將所持雨蓋。吹入湖心者甚夥。而游艇至此。遂大遭打擊矣。</p>
<p>游艇一名瓜皮船。舊式無蓬。且極簡樸。惟取其捷耳。近則艇作藍白色。兩舷圍以銅闌。中設奕座。上遮布篷。魚貫往來。宛如梭織。當風勢微動時。船家已料其必猛。遂急收篷划槳。擬附岸小泊。或艤棹於三潭印月或湖心亭。乃未及數武。風激舟横。浪花所濺。游客警惶失色。有呼援者。有艇祇載雙美。竟至嚶嚶啜泣。而舟子但竭力前進。以期達岸而已。</p>
<p>未幾天已昏黯。全湖似墨。而風仍未息。其間有暫泊岳墳者。有暫泊平湖秋月者。最後至西園埠頭諸艇。男女各游侣。無不衣履沾濕。彳亍而行。舟子猶呶呶向索酒資。而一般黃包車夫。尤莫不利市三倍幸諸艇舟子。富有經騐。是以未遭覆溺然不免飽受虚驚矣。</p>

<h3>關於批評梅蘭芳之一函（上）知</h3>
<p>梅蘭芳此行赴美。卒獲成功。薄海贊許。初非易事。乃近有以美國大學贈予博士學位一事。謾爲批評者。頃見趙君致韜奮君書。即辨其說。韜奮原有一文。載之生活。更過錄。兹將覆函鈔登。亦見好爲高論者。固示必能自圓其說也。覆函云。（上略）關於梅氏毁譽。愚初少指陳。則以與不足言者言之。徒滋詞費而已。獨前此章秋桐君主辦甲寅。有四維一論。以秋桐當代大師。不應遽作輕薄之語。馳書相抵。詳見甲寅周刋。今左右以學人主論壇。又雜志中之佼佼者。誠恐影響甚大。不得不爲冒瀆陳之。尊論首引將中國劇術貢獻美國民衆。增其智識。有究竟什麽之疑問。夫梅氏此行。志在使外人得知中國之戲劇藝術。同時又思攻錯他山。鼓勇自勵。携伴侣二十餘人。輦行笈百餘事。艨艟横海。爲前人所未有之壯舉。其志可嘉。無足贅譽。美人以新建之邦。多數人士。於東方一切文物。素少親炙對於中國劇藝。除百老滙之僞塑像。唐人街之廣東戲。（雖自有其長處然不足以代表中國戲之全部）朱連奎之幻術外。盡屬茫然。今乃得覩此雍容華貴之戲劇。添毫頰上之表演。雖不獲解。豈不明明爲增其智識。亦如村童山叟。一日襥被海隅。見電炬之熠燿。輪軌之交馳。固不必即研究科學發明之理由。然亦不得不謂之增加智識。此理甚明。左右於什麽者。當可釋然矣。下引西報評論。於申報錫以素以捧梅自任之考語。愚浪迹望平街。垂近十年。頗知報紙紀載。宜求博搜。政治學術。并當兼采。至於陶寫民性。研究藝事者。并復在所不慶。申報於各項新聞。無不特詳。梅事何能從簡。至其在滬時排日記載。則以梅氏之來。確爲社會上所普遍認識之人物。舉止賓集。欲知者甚多。夫社會新聞。雖公司宴會。春秋園游。猶得甄錄。何况梅氏。且登者不止一報。不止一國。左右苟得聞其在美日兩國時之報紙。則火車經程之際。雖小站逗留。不逾片時。亦有照片。大書深刻。當更訝然於引爲已任者。申報不過三千之一勺而已。西報所論。左右引其放棄夜宫生活。而崇拜東方藝術一語。斷章取義。顯有言外之音。然史稱周處士素横暴。忽而斬蛟射虎。以成其學。曾文正一號滌生。盡檢前失。以成其功業。則所謂放棄夜宫。崇拜藝術。寗不同揆。豈左右必欲周内其詞。以東方藝術與夜宫生活。相提并論。而斷爲卑之之說。則文義殊復牽率。不解自明。願進此爲解嘲。乞左右省之。</p>

<h3>心上温馨（二一六）包天笑</h3>
<p>第十二回别安離筵拈花留倩影名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿</p>
<p>侍者去取了十枝茄力克香烟來。也安放在一個碟子裹。左詩晨燃上了一枝吸了。初吸的幾口。似乎很有意思。到了後來。漸漸覺得有種辣味來了。再吸幾口。從辣味中還帶着澀味的。他因想到人生的經歷。有如吸香烟。涉世未深。便是初上口的烟味。繼而漸感到世味的辣。人生不幸。到處遇着打擊。人家以辣手相待。安得不皺眉嘗此辣味。及至世途艱澀。到處走不通。便到了澀的境地。旣而辣與澀的過程。處處坦然。便似老吸香烟的人。轉覺得深刻有味。漸漸的被它麻醉了。因此他只吸了半枝香烟。把那賸餘的半枝。擱在一個白磁的火柴揷上。這香烟的下半。便聽它焦了心燬去了。其實還没有到八點鐘。他是等人心急。加着只有一個人在這裏。有兩個人談談說說。就不覺得厭煩了。他今天懊悔不曾帶一本什麽書來看看。那時候大菜館正在上市的時候。許多侍者見這裏没有事。便跑往外面去了。他把那枝小掃也似筆。在一枝香的請客票局票後面。亂寫了一陣子。原來一個人每每有那種癖性。到了一個地方。見有筆有紙。不知不覺的就會亂塗。好像不塗了。手指上便會發癢。左詩晨等待蕊雲來。便在局票請客票的後面。大大小小。正正草草。寫了不少的蕊雲兩字。旣而八點鐘敲過了。八點零五分了。零十分了。十五分了。還不見來。直到了八點三十分光景。方纔是蕊雲和阿金姗姗而來。阿金先是用謝罪的聲音說道。二少。對不住。敎你等了好久了。左詩晨用着抱怨的神氣說道。我還是七點鐘没有敲。就到了此地了。你不是在電話裏說至遲八點鐘必到的嗎。現在你瞧是什麽時候了。阿金道。阿呀。眞正對不起了。本來八點鐘以前。我們車子在一枝香門前拉過了好幾回的。我還和阿因說。二少恐怕已經來了。伊說還有幾個當唱。我們索性出完了。再到一枝香去吧。以後再有堂唱。就呌鳳雲去。關照他們生意上。不要再來轉了。那末我們不是可以舒服服的吃一頓嗎。大概等人確是心焦。但到了那人來時。把以前焦慮。也就解釋了。况且又經阿金的一番解說。不再來轉局。那是多們寛慰的一件事。不然。那些龜爪子在門外嘮哩嘮叨。是多討厭呢。</p>

<h3>紗花紗銷零落不堪</h3>
<p>標準孱弱難振</p>
<p>棉紗實銷異常岑寂、各帮均無興奮氣象、世界花紗市况紊亂、人心愈弱、近日商場上且有數大户賣出、市面尤受其壓迫、但某廠商之多頭、仍無賣出之舉紗市受環境不良影響、一時深恐難以轉機云、</p>
<p>遠月紗續跌五六錢人標前市開盤、以美棉微漲、而金價又漲、散户購進、遂漲七八錢、二三盤人心驟疲、各月均跌六七錢、結果各月漲一·二錢午後聞實銷冷澹、全日祇有三百包生意、且原棉鬆動、人心愈虚、各跌一·四·五·六·八·錢、塲中均無大額出人、全日成交統計一萬四千九百五十包、兹將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市没精打彩</h3>
<p>棉市平疲、多數心理看跌、以美棉消費減少、後步尚有趨跌之慮、日商在印度購進印棉、在標準市塲套賣七八兩月陳棉、於是人心被其摇動、形勢愈衰、惟漢帮乘機扒空、棉市前途、尚有變化、滙兌則依然堅挺云、</p>
<p>漢標情勢疲漢標前市開盤、以美棉雖告立定、然賣方繼續加碼、購進者較缺、各漲五分至一錢、午後驟跌一錢五分至二錢、買進者金子帮、愼昌二千六百担、達豐一千七百担、天昌一千九百担、利昌二千五百担、賣出者大昌成一千二百担、義成昌一千七百担、長豐一千担、德記一千八百担、全日成交統計三萬八千五百擔、兹將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>通棉田約减一成</h3>
<p>新棉生育頗佳</p>
<p>據南通來者談該地棉價狀况云、本年新棉田較减、以米價昂貴、雨水較多改種稻作也就個人觀察、約較去年减百分之十左右新棉生育狀况、以雨水調和、頗爲良好云、</p>
<h3>海外花紗轉趨堅穩</h3>
<p>美棉抵空回漲昨日美棉初因利物浦消息良好而堅、旋因華爾街人心不振而疲、卒因空户抵補再望、計期貨漲十二至十五磅音、現貨漲十五磅音、英棉期貨漲跌一點、現貨漲五點、埃及棉現貨漲二十五點、印棉市况呆滯、市價不動、原電錄左（十八日電）、</p>

<h3>糧食洋米做開二萬餘包</h3>
<p>昨日洋米本客去胃甚濃、開出二萬餘包、本街内地與兩帮辦意尤貪、搶帽子之浮多亦趁勢收買價乃又漲二三角一號西貢竟大至十七元四角、二號亦至十六元六角、小絞十六元二角八分、大絞十五元七角半可蓋米十七半、敏當十七元成交數以大小絞爲最多、各開六七千包、其他二三千至五六百包不等、</p>
<h3>粉麥漲而復跌</h3>
<p>麫粉昨日粉市近遠月紛紛上漲、六月份大至二兩六錢三分、十一月大至二兩六錢一七五、餘月各至二兩六錢以上、買氣甚佳、人心看好、但漲後忽漲業外干涉、多頭首先回出、空頭趁勢加碼、各月份乃均回小、收市前廠方停出、且有客帮抽出現粉之實行、市面稍定、結果六月小二五、七月大七五、八月大五厘、九月大二五、十月不動、十一月小五厘云、</p>
<p>小麥昨日期麥開市後均步漲、因天雨後人心看高、兼因米市步步上漲、大助買方以極大聲勢、六月立漲五分、七月大八分八月大七分、遠期均大六七分、午後因粉市回小、人心帶小、收市六月小二分、七八月大四分、九十月大三分、十一月大五分、現麥開出清江·徐州等陳麥二千、價四兩四錢、新麥泰州麥五兩○二分、紹興崑山五兩○五六分、雙鳳五兩○八九分、沙市五兩一錢七分、其他四兩九錢半至四兩八錢共計一萬餘包云、</p>
<h3>絲茶紹屬新夏繭收成仍歉</h3>
<p>紹興舊府屬餘姚等縣、今歲春繭收成歉折、類均補育夏蠶、奈天時不良、初因寒冷發育遲滯、繼因大風冰雹、終則雷雨悶熱、致蠶蟻備受損害、在大眠中走失不少、大半殭斃、現下新繭陸續下簇、預計繭産統扯有三四分年歲、蠶户失望云、</p>
<h3>高莊珍眉歐銷續暢</h3>
<p>昨日婺源北鄕及抽芯珍眉、英法莊進意濃厚、針眉秀眉等項、亦略有去路、全市成交一千一百十八箱、珍眉頂盤一百八十五兩、市價無漲跌、祁門紅茶、交易减色、售盤亦見低二三兩云、</p>
<h3>婺源茶市頓轉生機</h3>
<p>茶號販大辦户園茶婺邑新茶自山户收園後、經號販搜辦、除西南路貨、十銷八九、東北兩路大宗户園茶、僅貨價相宜者、少數脫售、近兩旬來、幾無人過問、前日（十日）忽得滬棧電告、謂恊助會到滬、茶有生機云云、各號販以華茶大主顧頒臨、貢熙大帮、不慮滯銷、茶號紛紛派夥搜買户園新茶、議盤待開秤者、大有風起雲湧之勢、龍騰烏龍莊州茶、竟有十餘號爭辦、市面頓轉生氣、</p>
<p>子茶出新産質良好夏莊子茶、因月來連朝得露、出貨甚佳、葉軟香濃、初號販雖多注意搜買、惟以滬訊不佳、咸撳價少進、前日子茶出新、號出新價、每斤只三角零、山户以人工米價昂貴、停採不製、自得恊會辦茶消息、子茶標價由三角抬高至五六角、山户以此價倍增、均願採售、如近日天氣晴好、子茶出貨、當能踴躍云、</p>
<h3>疋頭元芳羽綢漲兩六錢</h3>
<p>東西疋一致猛漲、趨勢之激昂、實爲縱來未有實銷雖未屆當令、被匯市激動、已紛紛添辦北帮對於月華絨、彩條絨猛力搜辦、蓋乃大阪定價高翔之故、充斥一時之中柄絨、反呈隨到隨罄之象、令人意料不及、昨三千番鷄籠、一百號富華、三千番奇拔均開一錢八分半、黑花亦一錢八分半、大柄須一錢九分、惟行家開價又大一分之譜、直貢呢、直貢緞續漲一分至五厘、西貨益形狂漲、昨元芳呌價、元羽綢漲起一兩至一兩六錢、實爲歷來罕有之現象、故各貨莫不被其激動、昨載之大舞台元絨實未開出、係屬公平名利、爲九錢七分半、百子已須一兩二錢矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨龍口粉再漲半兩</h3>
<p>龍口線粉干市存本薄、兼以邇來粤閩銷胃尚暢、以致供不應求、行盤續漲半兩、已由十八兩半升至十九兩、但來源無繼、而需要尚殷、故趨勢緊秀、昨市手貨不多者已喊售十九兩半、雖未成盤、然鑒於貨底之缺、勢必再升也、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>勞動法原理謝曼</h3>
<p>國民政府財政部駐滬調查貨處編譯</p>
<p>卿雲圖書公司發行</p>
<p>中國迫切的問題是什麽、</p>
<p>在中國落後的勞働界、敗頽的實業界、迫不容緩的問題是什麽、勞資兩方將怎樣建樹它們的骨幹、</p>
<p>欲解除勞資兩方的糾紛、黑暗、我們都不能否認勞資之間的重要立法的存在、中國對於勞資兩方各方面的立法、從來没有注意到、是中國勞動界之所以落後、是中國實業界之所以衰頽、是中國勞資兩方之所以失去了生機、</p>
<p>這一部巨著是從美國康門司和安拙司（ＪohnR·CommonsandJohnB·Ａndrews）二氏合著的勞工立法原理（ＰrinciplesofLaborLegislation）一書中譯出的原著分爲九章、關於勞動立法要義、論得非常詳細、在歐美已負有勞動法百科全書之名、他的價值自然是無用得我們來開口了、可是這書裏所有的、只是六章、因爲不大切要於我國的情形、就刪去了三章、這六章是確實的切要於我國的需要的、</p>
<p>第一章是「勞工立法大要」、在第一第裏「勞工契約」裏、對於「工業」·「勞工法律」·「政治」、說得十分周密、第二節是「個人的權利」的闡明、第三節是「正當法律手續」、在「公權」方面對於維持治安權、及執行法律權、征稅權、保護權、收用財産權、管有權、警察權、商業權與聯邦政府權、警察權與憲法、都絲毫不陋、非常詳細、「職權」方面分行政部·立法部·司法部·管理部·四部、在原則方面對公共利益、法律之均等保護、也說得非常適到第二章是「最低工資立法之安義、内容是說最低工資立法的目的、最低工資律之經濟的極據、最低工資律之歷史上的發展、最低工資之標準、最低工資律的實施方法、最低工資律實施後的結果、美國的最低工資律與憲法問題、並却一一以歐美各國之實例參述</p>
<p>第三章是「工作時間」、對於童工、男工、女工的最多工作時間分别詳言、對於休息時間更有科學的社會的根據、</p>
<p>第四章是「失業問題」、闡明私立介紹所規則、公立介紹所規則、公共工作的系統支配、工業之整理及調節、</p>
<p>第五章是「工廠安全與衛生」、例舉各國國工廠對於工廠安全與衛生的實例、規定特種工人僱用之禁止、對於兒童規定年齡限制、體質限制、敎育限制、以及實行各項童工限制之難題的探討、對於婦女、分别禁止的職業與産婦的保護、對於男子規定體質的資格、與技術的資格、並說明特種物質或器械使用之禁止、最後着重於管理方面、分述工廠的管理、鑛廠和地道的管理、運輸業的管理、管理標準之設定、</p>
<p>第六章是「社會保險」、最先說工業災定的保險、分述雇主義務條例之規定、工業災害保險的創辦、以及美國的撫卹律、其次詳言健康保險、養老及殘病之保險、保寡保險制、失業保險制、實例尤多、各種制度的規定、詳盡無遺、</p>
<p>將這部精確詳盡的世界巨著介紹到勞動問題成爲大難而急待排解的中國裏來、自然是一個文化的急務、是勞動界的福音、</p>
<p>此書在世界上的聲勢是有他如許的歷史和地位、其在勞資兩方之實際的問題上當然是開關了一個導線的新生、</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一六九）美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第四十三章學藝復興期以後的意大文學</p>
<p>意大利的劇文學從極早就和音樂融合、而音樂不久便支配言詞了、三世紀之間、全世界是將意大利歌劇的音節或則歌唱、或則口吟、或則吹哨的、而記得寫作那些言詞的是誰者、千人中没有一人、留於世界的其餘部分的眼、或者不如說那耳的近代意大利的天才不是詩人、不是小說家、也不是軍人政治家加里波的、却是無可比肩的大作曲家朱綏配味第、他呢、便呢、便是那壯大的瓦格揑也没有超過他、音樂並不在這簡短的概觀的範圍中、然而我們决不可忘却劇與詩和歌曲（歌曲作具有最高的管絃樂底發達的全部的音樂解）之間的密接的關係、歐羅巴（並且丨也許丨亞細亞·亞非利加·亞美利加的）一切國民都已製作了歌謡了、意大利人一向是音樂藝術的世界的先生丨丨便是德意志人對此也非讓步不可、在這里便發生了深有興味的思辨的問題、（我們决不能找出確實的解答來）、在但丁以後意大利詩的或種荏弱和意大利音樂的連綿的壯麗之間可有什麽相對底的關係的麽、又將這問題帶到别國去、則英吉利、縱有那美的俗謡、但以音樂而言倒荏弱到無人不知、而以詩的藝術而言則在凡有近代諸國之中大抵是最强者、以内容和形式的多樣相而言、以天才詩人的數目而言、又是最有著强味的、這是什麽緣故呢、</p>
<p>近代意大利人、旣如以上所說、是古典的直接的繼承者、然而他們的古典主義却也並非敬虔模樣屈從底、開始於十八世紀而在十九世紀的前半達於那高潮點的羅曼底運動、捕捉了、征服了意大利人的想像力、出於蘇格蘭詩人詹姆士·馬克斐孫的手筆的從高盧人作品的眞實或許虚誕的翻譯、奥細安的「芬格爾」拆薩洛提將牠翻譯出來、那蘇格蘭人的作品是眞實的翻譯呢、還是虚僞的翻譯、是不成問題的、無論怎樣、他總顯示出自已的才能來、而他的羅曼斯便席捲全歐羅巴了、拆薩洛提的翻譯成了拿坡侖的愛讀書之一這事情、恐怕是值得記在這里的罷、</p>
<p>直至近世爲止那純粹的文學底價值未曾被認識的怪僻的天才人是卡薩諾發、他本來不是文學者、然而他在那「回想錄」之中、却發見了優美的散文體、那主材不宜於青年或天眞爛墁者也未可知罷、然而於體會字裏行間的年長者、卡薩諾發却像英吉利的日記家皮普斯似的、是偶然領會着叙事術的偉大的自已啓示者之一、又是並不自知的藝術家、他的聲價是跟了時的進行而增加的、英吉利批評家及哲學者哈味羅克藹理斯就他寫了一篇美而高明的論文了、他的「回想錄」屬於法蘭西文學、但他也用意大利文寫作、　　意大利一向常是富於喜劇的、但到十七世紀及十八世紀、意大利的劇壇便成爲有些僵硬模樣人工底了、（摩利爾以後的法蘭西的劇場、德來登以後的英吉利的劇塲也是如此、）有一個重建性格喜劇的天賦快活的才能的意大利的天才、就是威尼斯的本地人哥爾多泥、他所描寫的人物是威尼斯人、較廣地看來、他們是意大利人、更廣地看來、他們是普遍的人類、他在法蘭西很出名、然而英吉利的翻譯家却是忽視了他似的、他的戲曲、縱有那豐富的眞實可笑的人間性、大約不會「通過」英吉利的舞台的罷、可是我們却能一讀他的「回憶錄」、這是多年前曾經譯出、附有任美國駐威尼斯領事的最著名的小說家豪厄爾兹的序文的、</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Financial Authorities of Various Countries</h3>
<p>At this time of financial difficulty, one wants to implement austerity but cannot but also take into account undertakings. To take care of undertakings is to make it impossible to implement austerity. Thus government authorities have fallen into a predicament. The new tax law in the United States also originally wanted to reduce tax rates to slightly alleviate the burden on the people, but afterward, compelled by the facts, it had to be revised again and again, and finally went against its original intention. Now it is being strongly criticized by the people and friendly countries, and there is really no way to defend it. Germany's finances are also very difficult. In order to make up for the budget, the financial authorities wanted to forcibly levy a salary donation, which was opposed by the Federal Council. Also, the various methods previously proposed were rejected by the government and the party, so that unemployment benefits could not be met. Thus, the Minister of Finance had no choice but to resign under pressure. The unemployment problem in the United Kingdom is the most difficult problem. The Labor government's relief plan hopes that the Conservative Party will understand and help it. However, the Conservative Party is still trying to overthrow it. Today, Chamberlain presented a bill in the House of Commons to reduce the budget of the Ministry of Labor, intending to overthrow the government's relief policy. Although it was voted down, the Conservative Party's ideas of hindering the government are endless. The Labor government's difficulties are also not easy to get rid of. A Paris newspaper reports that the French government, for the sake of serious national defense, will submit to the Congress a budget of 10 billion francs for additional national defense expenses. This is of course a matter of great concern to the French people. Although it is still under secret discussion, once it is implemented, a debate will be inevitable in the parliament.</p>
<p>Looking at today's various news, the difficulties of financial authorities all lie in the budget, and the most difficult problems to solve in the budget are unemployment and national defense. The relief expenses for unemployment are the most urgent task at present, and the supplementary expenses for national defense are indispensable under the new trends.</p>

(19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After returning to Taiyuan, Yan reiterated that he would not form a government, because the previous obstacles to the National Construction of China were caused by the interference of military personnel. He is confident that he will not hinder National Construction, so how could he rashly form a government and repeat the same mistakes? He has no opinion on Party affairs, leaving Wang and other comrades free to use them, avoiding the old path of military force dominating Party affairs. Although he is one of the party members, because he leads troops, his qualifications to speak as a party member should be cancelled, etc. Party leaders who were preparing to go to Taiyuan yesterday have therefore suspended their trip.

<p>Jiangning People</p>
<h3>Oppose the Expansion of Municipal Boundaries</h3>
<p>Boundary Delimitation Meeting Held Internally</p>
<p>Provincial Representatives Do Not Wish to Disappoint Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the boundary delimitation between Jiangsu Province and Nanjing Municipality, the municipal government has repeatedly requested the handover according to the plan, as the municipal boundaries were finalized long ago. The provincial government has not complied because the people of Jiangning County are strongly opposed. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior convened representatives from both the province and the municipality to a meeting at the Ministry on the afternoon of the 19th. The people of Jiangning, through the Anti-Expansion of Municipal Boundaries Committee, argued that the municipal boundaries should be limited to the moat based on the Boundary Delimitation Regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Interior, and firmly rejected the previous resolution. One hour before the meeting, over three hundred people gathered at the Ministry of Interior to petition and request that representatives be allowed to attend to present their views. The Ministry initially did not agree. When the five provincial representatives arrived at the Ministry by car to attend the meeting, they were stopped by the people. Only Lin Wenli and Wu Danping were allowed to enter first, while the other three representatives waited outside the gate in their cars. At this time, Leng Jun, the Magistrate of Jiangning County, also arrived at the Ministry and repeatedly consulted with Wang Kuiyi, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, before finally obtaining permission for Wang Zhuozhi, a representative of the people, to attend and present his views. After he finished and exited, it was already 4 PM, and the meeting began. Over ten people attended, including representatives from the province and municipality, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Chief of the Capital Police Department. The municipal representatives stated that the case had been decided by the State Council and should be handed over in accordance with the decision, with no changes. The provincial representatives stated that upon arriving in Nanjing, they saw the Jiangning people's strong opposition and did not want to rush into a handover, so as not to disappoint the majority of public opinion. They needed to return to the province for instructions, formulate new clauses, and hold another meeting at a later date. The municipal representatives insisted that one side should request instructions while the other side should hand over, and that the handover should not be delayed by proposing new clauses. Both sides held their own views. Finally, the Ministry proposed that the Ministry submit the Jiangning people's petition and the municipality's reasons to the Executive Yuan for a decision, and order the provincial representatives to return to the province to formulate clauses, bring them to Nanjing next Wednesday, and continue the meeting to discuss. The meeting then adjourned. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Discusses Tianjin Customs Tariff Issues</h3>

However, he will ask the relevant authorities to pay special attention to this loan. Simpson also clearly stated that he has no prejudice regarding the timely repayment of domestic and foreign debts. He concluded by saying that tax revenue has been good recently, and the work of the Tianjin Customs is proceeding as it should. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>International Telecommunications Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The International Telecommunications Negotiation Committee of the Ministry of Communications held a meeting with representatives from Great Northern and Eastern Telegraph Companies on the afternoon of the 19th to settle the telephone charge. Both sides were represented by the same representatives as yesterday. There was a detailed discussion of the recent exchange of telegraph lines, the code used, the telegraphs sent by the company for China, the telegraphs forwarded by Chinese lines for the company, and the conversion of the price of francs. Because the price of francs was very low in the past, the converted price of silver is now several times higher due to the rising price of gold. The result was very satisfactory as to which price rate to use as the standard to avoid losses. The issue of abolishing the submarine cable contract was also mentioned.

<h3>German Finance Minister Resigns</h3>
<p>Financial Complexity Makes Management Impossible</p>
<p>Prime Minister Brüning Will Temporarily Concurrently Hold the Post</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 19th - German Finance Minister Dr. Mortenhauer has resigned due to the complexity of the financial situation and the difficulty of managing it. The previous German government collapsed on March 27th for the same reason. It is now expected that Prime Minister Dr. Brüning will temporarily concurrently hold the post to resolve the disputes.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 18th - German Finance Minister Mortenhauer has submitted his resignation. The cabinet members unanimously urged him to reconsider, but to no avail. Prime Minister Brüning will now submit it to the President. The position of the cabinet has become increasingly difficult. Even if the parliament is dissolved and re-elections are held, the government and the party are unlikely to increase their seats. Mortenhauer's decision to resign is due to the fact that the proposed mandatory salary tax to supplement the budget has been rejected by the Federal Council, and previous proposals have been rejected by the government and the party. The expenditure on unemployment benefits is increasing daily, and the national treasury is unable to cope.</p>

Johnson listed seven major points of the treaty that are detrimental to the United States: (1) The treaty will not enable the United States to reduce tax rates. (2) There is no provision for equality between the British and American navies. (3) On the contrary, it will raise the naval ratio set in Washington in the past for Japan, placing the United States at a disadvantage and endangering its maritime trade. (4) It will not only fail to eliminate naval competition. (5) On the contrary, it will break the theory that navies are only for the protection of commerce. (6) The construction of American cruisers must be subject to the whims of Britain, not to the self-determination of the United States. (7) Once the naval ratio of Japan is increased, the Pacific will be in danger and will become the center of activity for all countries in the world.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Propaganda Hosts the Press</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 19th, the Central Propaganda Department hosted the press. Chairman Liu Luyin first reported on the military victories in various areas, and then stated that the important issues at present are not only about the war, but also about starting with economic construction to establish a foundation for peaceful unification. When economic progress reaches a certain level, the roots of rebellion can be eradicated to a considerable extent. Everyone should not have the mistaken idea that economic construction should not be done because there is war in the country. It should be known that to eliminate the roots of internal strife, we must work together on economic construction. He also said that Mr. Ji Tao has studied this issue in the most detail and will introduce Dai Jitao's report, briefly stating that regarding this issue, considerable opinions have been expressed since New Year's Day this year. Recently, due to the issue of gold rising and silver falling, some opinions were expressed on the Central Broadcasting Station a few days ago. We must know that a public economic foundation is based on private economics, and national finance is based on the national economy. Therefore, whether viewed from a political or social perspective, the policies that the country and the people should take are the same, that is, the current military issues, the policies that the government should take, and the responsibilities that the people should bear are also the same. Now, when it comes to the national economic issue, everyone should pay attention to the principles of constancy and change. If we can clearly understand and firmly grasp the doctrine and policy of constancy, when a change occurs, we will not be wrong to think of ways to deal with the change based on our doctrine and policy of constancy. For example, if we can clearly understand and firmly grasp the Three Principles of the People as the constant path of nation-building, then all factual changes can be dealt with easily. In terms of the current political and military situation, why does the central government want to use troops? Since the recovery of Pingjin and unification the year before last, the central government has always adhered to the policy of peaceful unification and had no intention of using troops. The reason why troops are being used now is to deal with the current change, because some rebellious people who do not understand this principle refuse to improve and are arrogant, refusing to walk the right path with the central government, and are unwilling to take the path that ordinary people take together, running around on their own. Feng Yuxiang is an example. The year before last, when Feng arrived in Beiping, Generalissimo Chiang and Wu Zhihui said many things and spent a lot of effort. Brothers also used all possible methods along the way to drag him to Nanjing, always wanting to work together in harmony and strive towards peaceful construction. But he insisted on taking a small path instead of a broad road, not being the same as others, and only seeking to be different, and he didn't understand anything. He only knew how to be a bandit chief. All he knew were Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, and Little Five Gallants, etc., and he did not care about the world and the country. When others built railways, he insisted on demolishing them. When others talked about transportation, he insisted on blocking it. Furthermore, Yan Xishan insisted on going backwards instead of forwards. For example, the narrow-gauge Zhengtai Railway was economically disadvantageous. Yan proposed in the political conference the year before last to build narrow-gauge railways, still with the hopeless mindset created by Shanxi moneylenders in the past. Moreover, this hopelessness is still preserved underground in China. He has funds, but he deposits them in foreign banks. When others cheat him of his money, he has no way to deal with it. This is truly both foolish and pitiful. We must know that China's environment can only exist by moving upwards and forwards.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been these two unteachable and one unprogressive rebels. This is a change during the period of revolution and nation-building. If we do not defeat this change, the normal order will not be established, and the nation-state will decline and fall with it. After the unification the year before last, the central government tried its best to compromise and seek perfection in order to make the national steps consistent and build China well. However, when encountering this kind of change, it is necessary to make the greatest determination for the sake of saving the country and the people. No matter what kind of sacrifice is made, the foundation of the Republic of China must be supported and greedy people must be brought back to the right path. This is the reason for using troops. From an economic point of view, the rise of gold and the fall of silver is also a change. Ten years ago, when the price of gold fell to twenty exchanges, it was also a change. Looking from ten years ago to today, this kind of change is very obvious. In my simple view, China is still a country that uses raw silver and has no so-called currency. Ten years ago, during the European War, the economy and finance of European countries that used gold stagnated, resulting in a major change. Gold fell step by step, which is a chaotic phenomenon in gold-using countries. Now, the domestic situation in China is empty everywhere, and the silver in various trading ports, especially in the concession areas, is stagnant and does not flow to the interior. The whole finance is not circulating. This is a major change. Looking at these two changes, (1) the price of gold ten years ago, European countries quickly restored industrial production after the war, reorganized fiscal and monetary systems, and the economic situation returned to its original state. (2) Now, to restore the normal track of the economy and reverse the decline in the price of silver, it is necessary to dredge the market. If everyone can devote more effort to the development of inland production, the price of silver and the market will also be easily restored. Therefore, the current tragic fall in the price of silver is not necessarily a good opportunity to stimulate a major awakening among the people of the whole country. Imported goods may be reduced as a result, and many people in the industrial and commercial sectors, and even wealthy people, are all determined to invest in the interior and develop industries. In this way, the change can be easily cured, which cannot be cured by small adjustments, just as the rebellion of Yan and Feng cannot be resolved by toleration. The third point is that we combine politics and military affairs to see that China's need for construction is a matter of course. In the great plan of the national economic organization, that is, the industrial policy written by the Premier, there are several things that must be done well first. It must be done well with the support of the people of the whole country and a powerful government.</p>
<p>For example, the connection of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to connect the provinces of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River; second, the southwestern provinces are locked on all sides, and there is no way to do anything. To open up the great resources of the southwest, that is, the construction of the Yunnan-Guangdong Railway to connect the southwestern provinces; third, the Longhai Railway from the southeast to the northwest, the first step is to make Lanzhou the end point, must be completed as soon as possible. Once these railways are open, the inland people's work will have economic value, foreign capital can help inland development, and inland goods can be supplied to foreign markets for use, and people's lives can be solved. From this, the national economic construction has a foundation. We demand unification is to do these things. Let's look at what the so-called rebel army is like. Now, the most miserable and inhuman is Shaanxi. There are only a few million people left. Its valuable production has also lost its value because it cannot be transported. The National Government decided on two policies the year before last: one is emergency relief, that is, disaster relief; and the other is poverty relief, that is, developing the country's financial resources. The political view is also the same. Therefore, at that time, I introduced many people to the northwest. The first step was to help those places build some basic infrastructure. The second step was to support the local people to rise up to do political and cultural work, and production business. However, Feng's policy towards the northwest was exactly the opposite of what we said. He insisted on not allowing foreign talents and financial resources to enter. We want to use the financial resources of the southeast to develop the northwest, but he shut it down. The price of cotton in Shaanxi is only a dozen yuan, while it is more than thirty taels in Shanghai. If it can be transported, Shaanxi Province is already very rich. Taking this as an example, it can be inferred that the poverty and disasters in the northwest are all caused by his deliberate actions. Therefore, the Americans investigated and said that the Shaanxi disaster was man-made, not heaven-sent. Man-made disasters cannot be relieved. Military governance, politics, and finance are all the same. I hope that the press will promote and advocate to make people in the economic circle wake up and know that it is impossible to just sweep the snow in front of their own doors. If the Shanghai market is closed and they are unwilling to invest in the interior to help the government's construction, then it is no different from the barbarians everywhere who do not communicate with culture. If the big port of Shanghai does not use its power to develop towards the interior, the result will inevitably be stagnation and chaos, then Shanghai will be in danger. Now some people are unwilling to start doing charity, but these are passive and have little power. Although we also want to do it, we should also broaden our horizons and unite our strength to do various production businesses. This is really a good thing to save the country and the people. If we put our strength into developing the interior, it will benefit others and ourselves, and it will also generate profits. Some people say that they don't go because the interior is not peaceful. This reason is no longer sufficient and cannot be forgiven. In summary, one point is that people in concession market places should know that the interior is our home, don't forget it, and use financial resources to help the development of industries in the interior and help the government's economic construction. The government is now doing its best to find ways to facilitate and reward them. The second point is that the people should unite in spirit to help the government and resolutely achieve the final victory in this war, and recognize the two kinds of bandits who do not improve and do not learn well. China is already poor. If the bandits are recognized and the whole country is unimpeded, then everything will be possible. The social people must definitely help the central political and military unification in order to establish a foundation for peace in the future. I hope that you will promote and advocate from all sides, so that the interior will have a way, then Shanghai will have a way. Overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic to invest in the interior, working hard for their motherland and their hometown in the revolutionary cause, but people in the interior who have earned money and gone to the concession areas do not care about their hometown. As a result, only the concession areas are becoming more lively, and the interior is becoming more desolate. Various crises are hidden here. The interior must be good before the various ports and markets can be good. In general, at this moment, we must pay attention to the fact that economic changes come from economic underdevelopment. To make the economy develop, we must use foreign capital, that is, machines and technology. As for its method, that is, what the Premier said is that those who control it are safe, and those who control it are lost. I hope you will pay attention. Now there are still many people in the society who do not understand, have no courage and thought. The Premier's article on how China's industry should be developed should be studied in detail. Now to promote and publicize this point so that all the people can understand is a good way to save the crisis. I personally will have the opportunity to go to Shanghai in the future to guide the various industrialists and businessmen, and I hope that the press can influence them. If they can be as enthusiastic as the overseas Chinese, then China's economy, politics, and military can all have a way. Dismissed at four o'clock.</p>

<h3>Open Letter to Compatriots in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guangdong (Continued)</h3>
<p>In the past, when the Guangxi warlords occupied Wuhan, they often wanted to annex Hunan in order to realize their dream of Greater Guangxiism. In the spring of the eighteenth year, they used force to approach Xiangyuan and forced the Xiang Chairman Lu Diping to leave, which was a great manifestation of their ambition to annex. Later, because they were attacked by the central government, their dream turned into a bubble. Last winter, the rebel Zhang rebelled again in western Hubei and fled through western Hunan, looting along the way. The government offices and people's houses were looted, no less than re-enacting the tragedy of the Communist Party's burning and killing. Now, the rebel has colluded with the Guangxi faction and led a large number of bandits to Hunan, just wanting to seize Hunan again and re-enact his masterpiece.</p>
<p>In short, the rebels Zhang and the Guangxi faction are all wandering bandits who have ravaged our provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guangdong. They are the greatest enemies of our compatriots in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guangdong. Their various crimes of harming the country and the people are really too numerous to mention. Just the few points listed above are enough to show that their crimes deserve death. Now, the central government's punitive expeditionary army is besieging and encircling the rebels to eliminate them completely, prevent the scourge of the Communist bandits' riots, protect the safety of the lives and property of our compatriots in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guangdong, and consolidate the foundation of the revolutionary forces in our southern provinces. Therefore, the compatriots in Hunan Province, who are now under the trampling and oppression of the rebels, should rise up with the spirit of revolution, not be succumbed to violence, not supply food and fodder, not pay extortion, and automatically organize civil groups to assist the central army and fight with the rebels. And our compatriots in Guangxi Province should also assist the military and political authorities, strive to eliminate the remnants of the rebels in Guangxi, and strictly prevent them from fleeing back to Guangxi and causing harm again. As for our compatriots in Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong Provinces, they should unite, maintain rear order, and strictly prevent the sabotage of bandits, Communists, reactionaries, and reorganizers, so that the punitive expeditionary army can eliminate the rebels as soon as possible, so as not to flee as wandering bandits, re-enact the tragic Communist disaster, and affect the progress of the punitive expedition against the rebels Yan and Feng. During the serious period of punishing the rebels, our compatriots in various provinces must recognize that the rebellion of Yan, Feng, Zhang, and Gui is actually the last struggle of the feudal warlords and all counter-revolutionary forces, and it is also the most important key to the success or failure of the national revolution of our party. If our compatriots do not do their best to assist the central government and quell the rebellion, then the feudal warlords and reactionary forces will reappear and expand. As a result, they will either fall into the state of riots in the two lakes of Guangdong and Jiangxi, or re-enact the dark politics of Xu, Duan, Cao, and Wu. Our country and nation will fall into a state of eternal doom. At this critical moment of the success or failure of the revolution and the survival of the party and the country, we must work together to overcome this difficulty, support the central government and eliminate all rebels, so that the country can achieve true unification and lasting peace, so as to relieve the suffering of the people and complete the work of political tutelage. Our slogans are: (1) Strive to annihilate the Communist Party's reorganized tool, the rebel Zhang Fakui. (2) Zhang Fakui is the chief culprit who colluded with the Communist Party to burn and kill the people of Guangzhou. (3) Zhang Fakui is a wandering bandit who poisons Hubei and Jiangxi and ravages Hunan and Guangxi. (4) The intrusion of the rebels Zhang and Gui into Hunan is to re-implement the great massacre of redification. (5) Eliminating the rebels Zhang and Gui is to eliminate the source of the Communist Party's chaos. (6) Eliminating the rebels Zhang and Gui is to protect the safety of the people's lives and property. (7) The military and the people unite sincerely to eliminate the remaining warlords of Yan, Feng, Zhang, and Gui. (End)</p>
<h3>The Fourth Route Army Recovers Changsha</h3>
<p>He Guoguang Leads the Main Force to Continue Advancing</p>
<p>The Zhang-Gui Army Collapses in Three Routes</p>
<p>He Yingqin Schedules a Trip to Hunan to Console the Troops</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that after the central government's various armies converged on designated locations, the remnants of the Zhang-Gui army were surrounded on all sides. The Wuhan headquarters, recognizing the time was ripe, issued a general attack order at dawn on the 16th, ordering the armies to advance along different routes, to capture Changsha within three days, clear Zhang-Gui within ten days, and dispatched Chief of Staff He Guoguang to Hunan to direct operations. He departed from Hankou that morning with Xia Douyin, Qian Dajun, and others, arriving in Yuezhou that evening. At that time, the commander of the Fourth Route Army, He Jian, had advanced from Changde to Ningxiang, and upon receiving the general attack order, ordered Wei Suzhong to select 2,000 brave men to occupy Yuelu Mountain, confronting the enemy army in Changsha across the river. That night, Wei led two daredevil regiments to cross the river from Longwang Temple at the foot of Yuelu Mountain and attack Changsha. The enemy army, Tang Shengming's regiment and a regiment of Zhang Fakui's forces, offered slight resistance before retreating towards Datopu. Wei's forces completely recovered Changsha at 11:35 AM on the 17th, immediately issued notices to appease the people, restored order inside and outside the city, and telegraphed Commander He Jian to quickly come to Changsha to take charge. After receiving the telegram at Yuanjiangkou, He immediately telegraphed the headquarters to report the victory, ordered Liu Jianluo's forces to make contact with Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai's divisions, and personally rushed to Changsha from Yuanjiangkou, expected to arrive around the 18th. This is the process of the recovery of Changsha. As for the Chief of Staff of the headquarters, He Guoguang, who was ordered to supervise the army, after arriving in Yuezhou, the fighting on the front lines was very fierce. The Second Fleet of the Navy, except for two ships left to guard Yuezhou, all advanced fiercely towards Changsha from Lulin Tan, Jinggang, and Xia Ning, attacking by land and water. He ordered the main forces to continue advancing, and on the 17th, they had crossed Miluo. The central army from Tongcheng also advanced to Pingjiang, advancing towards Changsha together. He Guoguang, Qian Dajun, Xia Douyin, and others were all directing at the front lines. It was reported that the remnants of the Zhang-Gui army had collapsed in three routes, one led by Bai Chongxi, retreating towards Youxian, one led by Zhang Fakui, retreating towards Liuyang, and one led by Tang Zhemian and Tang Shengming, retreating towards Liling, seemingly aimless, only trying to escape. The headquarters here has ordered the armies to continue encircling and attacking to prevent them from fleeing elsewhere. It is reported that Director He Yingqin is scheduled to personally go to Hunan in the coming days to console the troops and plan for the aftermath in Hunan. (June 18)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that the Zhang-Gui army, though claiming to have twelve divisions, actually had no more than 20,000 men. After arriving in the province, they extracted local rifles in various counties and recruited bandits in order to expand their strength. Unexpectedly, they were surrounded by five routes of the central army in a short time. The battles on the second, third, and fourth routes were the most intense. Only Huang Shaohong's forces could not resist. Bai Chongxi was originally supervising the battle near Yuezhou, so he personally led Tang Zhemian's forces back to the province to join the Liling front line and help Huang resist. On the Yuezhou front, only Zhang Fakui and Yang Tenghui's forces were holding out against the central army. There were no troops to resist He Jian's Fifth Route Army, so they moved all the ships and automobiles on the west bank of the Xiangjiang River to the east bank, preparing to defend the river. This was the situation before the 14th. At 6 PM on the 15th, two warships suddenly came down the river from Wuhan, entering the provincial river and shelling Changsha City, firing a total of seven shells. The whole city was shaken for a time, and shops closed one after another. Li Zongren, knowing that Changsha was surrounded on five sides and could not be defended for long, telegraphed Bai Chongxi in Liling, Zhang Fakui in Tongcheng, and Li Pinxian in Changsha, advocating abandoning Changsha and ordering his personnel to pack their bags and prepare to leave. How Zhang, Bai, and others replied has not yet been ascertained, but it is certain that Li Zongren has already prepared his luggage. On the morning of the 16th, warships again shelled Changsha from the river. On the Pingyue front, Zhang-Gui's troops have retreated to the provincial capital, moving to Lizhu. Judging from the situation, it seems that they will soon retreat completely. (June 16)</p>
<p>Wuhan Garrison Command</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Smuggling of Opium Discovered</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that the Yuchuan steamer, sailing from Sichuan to Hankou, arrived in Hankou from Sichuan on the 26th of last month. The Wuhan Garrison Command, during the period of martial law, routinely inspected it and discovered that the ship was smuggling 316 boxes of opium, a major case worth 3 million yuan. The Garrison Command considered the case to be of great importance and transferred the opium to the Ship Inspection Office, assigning personnel to monitor it, and reported it to the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters for instructions. After the case occurred, Shen Gongli, the director of the Special Tax Bureau of Hubei and Hunan, immediately reported to the headquarters, saying that the opium had been repeatedly telegraphed by the Chongqing Fiscal Planning Office to the special commissioners for approval, and all handling procedures would be handled in Hankou in accordance with the regulations, and that the three provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Guizhou had already established joint transportation measures and had been approved on file. He requested that all rights be returned immediately. After receiving the report, the headquarters ordered Wei Ersheng, chairman of the Special Tax Supervision Committee, to investigate and report back. According to the report, there were many doubts in this case, and loopholes were inevitable. It should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with in order to warn against evil and maintain national taxes. On the 14th of this month, the headquarters ordered the adjutant's office and the military law office, the Hubei Provincial Government, the Wuhan Garrison Command, the Hubei Financial Special Commissioner's Office, and the Special Tax Supervision Committee to each send one cadre member to form a review committee, with Wang Wenyang, the director of the adjutant's office of the headquarters, as the chairman, to conduct a rigorous review, collect evidence, and report back fairly. After receiving the order, the various agencies immediately appointed personnel and formed the committee on the 17th. On the same day, they convened the first review meeting and decided to start with an investigation, striving to get clues in the shortest possible time. The provincial government also attached great importance to this matter, given its responsibilities. Yesterday, it specifically sent a letter to the garrison command, requesting that the case be sent to the government for strict handling according to the law. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the case of the Yuchuan ship transporting 316 boxes of special goods, arriving in Hankou from Chongqing, our government previously received a report and sent personnel to investigate. Later, we received a letter from the Special Tax Bureau of Hubei and Hunan, informing us of the progress of the situation. The committee also worked with your department's Staff Officer Wang and Deputy Officer Yao to investigate, and the cases are on file. However, the special goods transported by the ship did not go through all the procedures for weighing, affixing stamps, and paying taxes, and the Special Tax Bureau of Hubei and Hunan was not notified in advance. There are obviously other illicit details. Article 10 of the Rules for the Implementation of Opium Prohibition states that in order to prevent the smuggling of opium and its substitutes within the country, each senior local government should supervise the anti-opium organs under its jurisdiction to implement strict inspections at important passes or railway stations and ports. If smuggling of opium and other substitutes, or implements specifically for manufacturing and smoking opium, is discovered, they should be detained immediately, along with the criminals, and sent to the court for punishment in accordance with the law. It is said that our government has a heavy responsibility for anti-opium affairs in the whole province, and should handle it in accordance with the law to maintain the prohibition policy. However, since the special goods have been transported and sealed by your department, should they be sent back to our government for strict handling in accordance with the applicable scope, or are there other bases for handling them directly? We hereby request you to investigate and reply." (June 18)</p>
<h3>Liu Heding Repels Lu Xingbang's Forces</h3>
<p>The Battle on the Outskirts of Minyuan Comes to an End</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou states that after the two divisions of Liu Heding and Lu Xingbang engaged in battle in the northwestern suburbs of Fuzhou, Liu's division took a defensive posture from the 7th to the 11th. On the morning of the 12th, the entire Chen Wantai brigade of Liu's division stationed in Quanzhou was transferred to the province, and an order was issued to turn defense into offense, ordering the Chen Wantai brigade to be responsible for rear security, the Gui Zhenyuan brigade to be responsible for the northern route, attacking Lu's forces at Dafuling and Tongpanshan from Ma'anshan, and the Liu Shangzhi brigade to be responsible for the western route, attacking Lu's forces at Baicailun and Wanshoushan from Qixiashan. At that time, there were about two regiments guarding the northern route, commanded by Brigade Commander Lu Xingrong, and there were also two regiments guarding the western route, commanded by Chief of Staff Yu Bailiang of the division headquarters. In total, the strength of both sides was more than 12,000 men. At 12:00 that night, Liu's division began a full-line general offensive. The northern route was supervised by Regiment Commander Jiang Yan, and the western route was supervised by Regiment Commander Yan Ximin. At about 1:00 AM on the 13th, the artillery fire soared into the sky, and residents in the city were awakened from their dreams. When Liu's division rushed to the middle of the mountain, the front team engaged in bayonet fighting. At 6:00 AM, the northwestern positions of Lu's forces were broken by Liu's division, and the four hills of Dafuling, Tongpanshan, Baicailun, and Wanshoushan were completely occupied. Lu's forces were defeated and retreated to Tongkou and Ganzhe in the western countryside. After 8:00 AM, Liu's division successively transported the captured weapons back to the city by car for placement. The Red Cross and the Red Swastika Society sent teams to the front lines to bury the dead and treat the wounded. The battle on the outskirts of Fuzhou, which had lasted for seven days, came to an end here. On the 14th, Liu's division transferred the front-line teams back to the Donghu camp for rest, and the rear-line teams took over the defense of the front. The captured flags of Lu's forces were hung along the roadside in the division headquarters area to celebrate the victory. However, the houses of the farmers in the war zone were bombarded by artillery fire, and livestock and money were mostly lost, resulting in a tragic situation of being homeless and without food. The Minhou County Government specifically convened representatives of various social organizations on the afternoon of the 16th to hold a post-war meeting in the war zone to discuss disaster relief measures.

<h3>Detailed Account of Lü Huanyan's Assassination</h3>
<p>The Assassin was Lü's Personal Bodyguard</p>
<p>Bribed by Bai Chongxi's Aide</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Lü Huanyan, Deputy Commander of the Eighth Route Army and concurrently Commander of the Sixteenth Division, traveled from Wuzhou on the 11th with Chief of Staff Wu Fan, Head of Logistics Chen Min, and others aboard the "Shenglite" steamer, then transferred to the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway to Guangzhou. His purpose was to seek instructions regarding the aftermath of affairs in Guangxi Province, and to bid farewell to Chen Jitang, who was departing to supervise military operations. They lodged at the New Asia Hotel in Xihoukou. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 AM yesterday morning (the 15th), Lü was shot and killed by his bodyguard. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lü's Residence: Lü Huanyan's stay in Guangzhou was temporary, and he resided on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel on Taiping South Road. On the 12th, before Lü arrived, his staff reserved rooms 712 and 714 on the seventh floor, at a rental cost of fifteen yuan per day. They also rented room 701, valued at twenty-five yuan per day, for Lü to receive guests. The registration was under the name of Yang Ding, age forty, from Wuzhou, described as military personnel. The "From Where" column stated "Yishi" (First City), noting that he was in the province temporarily on official business. It was found that Lü was accompanied by his mother, wife, secretary, adjutant, male and female servants, and guards, totaling more than twenty people. There was also an office steamboat docked on the Pearl River. After Lü arrived at the hotel, many important figures and visitors came to call daily, the threshold worn through. Lü was very cautious when receiving guests. His staff would first announce the visitor, and unless it was a particularly important official matter requiring a personal meeting, he would send a representative to receive them. Lü himself stayed in room 712, and all visitors were received in room 701.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Assassination: At midnight on the 14th, Lü was in room 712, ordering several Western-style dishes for a late-night snack. He instructed the hotel staff to prepare in advance, and he went out by car to handle official business for about ten minutes, then returned to the hotel by car. He removed his outer coat, wearing only a Western-style undershirt and shorts, and went to room 712 to eat. The meal consisted of ham and eggs, roast pigeon, shredded chicken rice, and milk tea. While eating the last dish of ham and shredded chicken rice at 1:15 AM, Lü's bodyguard, Feng Mingsheng, standing behind Lü, drew a No. 3 revolver and shot Lü in the back. The bullet passed through his abdomen. Lü immediately cried out for help. Feng, believing his mission accomplished, dropped the gun on the floor and fled the room. Although seriously injured, Lü managed to run out of the room shouting for help. Upon hearing the commotion, the staff sounded the alarm and desperately pursued the fleeing assassin downstairs.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>The Assassin's Arrest: As the assassin reached the stairwell, he was blocked by another hotel employee. Feng pushed the employee, Chen Yu, to the ground and ran downstairs. Witnessing this, the employee continued to pursue him. Feng fled down the stairs and out the door, escaping north on Taiping Road. The hotel staff continued to pursue him, and Feng fled into Baoshun Street and out onto Yihe Street. Finally, with the help of police officers Huang Weifa and Liang Shiheng from the Taiping Road and Yihe Street areas, along with the hotel staff, Feng was captured and taken to the Taiping Branch Bureau for investigation. Under interrogation, the assassin identified himself as Feng Mingsheng, 21 years old, from Nanning, and stated that he was Lü's guard, but denied having assassinated Lü. Despite repeated questioning, Feng continued to deny the crime. The branch bureau detained Feng for further action.</p>
<p>Inquiries by Important Figures: After Lü was assassinated, he collapsed in his room (712). Upon hearing the news, Zhong Mingyuan, the hotel manager, realized the gravity of the situation and reported it by telephone to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, the Provincial Government, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the Taiping Road Branch Bureau. Subsequently, a large number of armed police officers were dispatched from the Taiping Branch Bureau to surround the hotel, temporarily preventing guests from entering or leaving. This restriction was lifted at 8:00 AM the next morning. Upon receiving telephone calls from the hotel, Chen Jitang, Chen Mingshu, Ouyang Ju, and others arrived at the hotel to inquire about the situation. However, Lü was already on the verge of death and unable to speak.</p>
<p>Medical Treatment: After Lü was wounded and collapsed, his family discovered him and urgently summoned doctors for treatment. Doctors Situ Zhao, Chen Yaojia, He Xusheng, and others from Taiping Road arrived at the hotel to provide medical assistance. Officers from the military medical department also rushed to the scene to assist in the rescue. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he was transported by car to the No. 1 Hospital on Baizi Road in Dongshan (formerly the Japanese Public Hospital) for treatment. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, approximately five minutes later, Lü died from his injuries.</p>
<p>Temporary Martial Law: The incident occurred late at night, at 2:00 AM. After Chen Jitang and Chen Mingshu arrived at the hotel and inquired about the assassination, it was suspected that Lü's guards were complicit, as they stood by and did nothing during the attack. Lü's guards, including Chen Qing, were arrested and taken to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters for investigation. Ouyang Ju ordered a temporary martial law. Chen also directed the police to disarm the remaining fourteen guards on the spot. Even Lü's flagship, the "Xin Li Sheng," docked at the Changdi Bay, was searched, and all the guards were disarmed. The military officers who accompanied Lü to Guangdong were also detained for several hours, before Chief of Staff Wu Fan vouched for them, and they were released. All guests at the New Asia Hotel were temporarily restricted from entering or leaving, and police officers were dispatched to enforce martial law at major intersections until dawn.</p>
<p>Assassin Handed Over to Headquarters: Considering that there must be political reasons behind this case, important military and political figures immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to hand over the assassin, Feng Mingsheng, to headquarters overnight for strict interrogation. They also comforted Lü's family and sought ways to handle the aftermath. Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to the central government and various military and political figures in Guangxi, reporting the details of Lü's assassination. After the assassin was handed over to headquarters for interrogation, he confessed that he had followed Chairman Lü for many years. This time, he was used by others, bribed with 10,000 yuan, and impulsively killed Chairman Lü. He expressed that he was truly sorry to the Party and the country. After learning about Feng's confession, the important figures considered it extremely important and ordered that it be handled with the utmost caution.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Funeral Committee: After Lü passed away at the hospital, Yang Dingzhong, a consultant from the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, contacted the hospital to arrange for funeral services. The hospital agreed to provide the basement of the main building as Lü's funeral office and set up a tent in the vacant lot behind it to house the coffin. Yesterday afternoon, a long strip of white paper with the words "Lü Family Funeral Office" was posted above the door of the office. A similar strip was also posted on the front gate of the hospital.</p>
<p>The Assassin's Background: Feng Mingsheng, the assassin, was Lü's most trusted bodyguard. Feng was from Nanning, young, and courageous. He had been following Lü for several years, always by his side. However, according to Lü's mother, the assassin was exceptionally cunning and she had long wanted Huan Yan to dismiss him, but the assassin was very respectful to Huan Yan and was quite clever, so she could not bear to dismiss him. Furthermore, it was found that no guards other than Feng Mingsheng could enter Room 712 without orders, which shows Lü's trust in the assassin. The gun used by the assassin was also Lü's personal weapon, which he did not carry himself, so he ordered the assassin to carry it and stay by his side. He never expected that the assassin would use the gun to assassinate his master. It was said that the gun had six bullets. When it was found on the floor of the room, one bullet had been fired, and five remained inside.</p>
<p>Telegrams Reporting to All Parties: After the incident, Chen Mingshu and Chen Jitang telegraphed the central government to report everything.

<p>Labor Dispute in the Pharmaceutical Industry Difficult to Resolve: Wu Shouchun, Jin Meishou, and other pharmacies in Zhangliantang Town, Qingpu County, dismissed employees without reason during the Dragon Boat Festival.

Therefore, the employees were dissatisfied and reported to the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union, which forwarded the report to the County Party Department. The County Party Department sent personnel to the Workers' Union and the Pharmaceutical District Council to mediate. Unexpectedly, the employers were rude and unreasonable. The representatives, seeing no hope of resolving the matter, had no choice but to report to higher authorities for review.</p>

<p>Record of the Appeal Hearing of the Shanghai Rape Case: Zhang Zhiming, a 25-year-old Shanghai native and car driver of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau, induced Zhou Xiufen, a 17-year-old Chongming girl living in the ancestral hall next to the Finance Bureau, at the Xinxin Lane entrance on Jin Shenfu Road at around 6:00 PM on March 16 of this year. He pulled her to the Shunxing Inn on Jin Shenfu Road, opened room number two, and committed rape. At that time, Zhou Xiufen screamed for help but was threatened by Zhang not to make a sound. After being humiliated, Zhang ordered Xiufen to go back at around 11:00 PM that night and not to say anything. After Xiufen returned home, her parents asked her why she came home so late at night. Xiufen revealed the whole story. The next morning, her parents took Xiufen to report to the police station in charge and ordered the police to arrest Zhang Zhiming and send him to the Shanghai Local Court. After the trial, Zhang Zhiming was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for the crime of disrupting public morals. Zhang refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Pan Zhenya to appeal to the High Court. The trial has been held several times, but because Zhou Xiufen has not been present in court, it has not been concluded. Zhou Xiufen has now been summoned to court for a public hearing in the afternoon of the 19th. The presiding judge is Zhao Zhengda. First, the defendant Zhang Zhiming was questioned. He stated that he was a 25-year-old Shanghai native who had been working as a car driver at the Finance Bureau for two years. He consistently denied raping Zhou Xiufen and said, "At 6:00 PM on March 16, the staff had all gone back, and I went to Shanghai. I returned to the bureau at 9:00 PM to sleep. There are fifteen or sixteen people in my room. The bed is like a pigeon coop. I slept on top. When I went back, Xu Chunlin and Zhang Zhishan asked me where I went. I replied that I went to Shanghai." The official asked, "Did you eat anything after you went back? Do you usually go out?" Zhang replied, "I only went out once in a month. I didn't eat anything when I went back that day. I just drank a cup of tea and went to sleep." Next, the witness Xu Chunlin was questioned. He stated that he was from Jiangxi and lived in the bureau. "I am a tea boy and Zhang Zhiming is a friend. Zhang Zhiming went out around 6:00 PM and came back at 9:00 PM. After he came back, he went to bed. I was already in bed at that time, so I didn't pay much attention to what he did that day." Then, Zhang Zhishan was questioned. He stated that he was 33 years old, from Haimen, and lived next to the Finance Bureau on Fenglin Bridge. "I have been a car driver for the Finance Bureau for three years. I met Zhang Zhiming in the bureau. At 5:00 PM on March 16, I sent the director home and returned to the bureau at 11:00 PM. I went to Zhang Zhiming's room to wash my face. At that time, Zhang Zhiming was already asleep in bed. I didn't know that Zhang Zhiming had gone out." Next, Zhou Xiufen was questioned. She stated that she was 17 years old, from Chongming, and lived in the ancestral hall on Fenglin Bridge with her parents. "I work in the cigarette factory on La Fayette Road. I didn't know Zhang Zhiming before. My mother washes clothes for people because my family is poor. Zhang Zhiming often brought clothes to my house to wash, so I know him. I have never had a private meeting with Zhang Zhiming. A little after 6:00 PM on the night of March 16, I came out of the factory and passed by the entrance of Xinxin Lane on Jin Shenfu Road. I saw Zhang Zhiming standing next to the utility pole. Zhang immediately came up and asked me to buy something. I didn't go. He came up and pulled my hand. I shouted, but he threatened me not to make a sound and dragged me to the Shunxing Inn. He opened room number two upstairs. I didn't want to go in at that time. I said my parents would beat me. He told me to say that I was playing at my little sister's house. He hugged me to the bed like a small chimney and pulled open my pants. I was humiliated by him. At 11:00 PM, he told me to go home. After I went back, my parents asked me, so I told my parents what happened. The next morning, I went to the police station to report. Later, because it was not safe to stay in Shanghai, I moved to Qingpu, etc." Then, Dao Ting, a bailiff of the Shanghai Local Court, and Pan Zhenhu's wife, the hostess of the Shunxing Inn, were questioned. Pan stated that Zhang Zhiming did bring a woman to open a room on that day. Then, lawyer Pan stood up to defend. Judge Zhao declared the debate in this case concluded and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Molesting Xiaocuizi: Li Changzhen, a wounded soldier from the Suzhou 15th Hospital, became acquainted with Xiaocuizi (16), the son of Ma Songshan from Sanliuwan, because of washing clothes. On the previous (18th) day, he directly entered Ma's house and molested Xiaocuizi. He was rejected. Afterwards, his companion Deng Guijia and others believed that Li's actions hindered the reputation of all the wounded soldiers in the hospital, so they tied him up and sent him to the county government for punishment. He was subsequently handed over to the West Third Police Station for dispatch to the National Guard for handling.

<p>Alarming Rice Prices: Since the beginning of spring, the rice prices in our county have been soaring step by step, causing panic among the poor and the common people. Recently, due to the scarcity of sources and the small amount of inventory, the rice prices have continued to rise. As of yesterday, the market price of white rice has risen to 18.4 yuan per stone, and rough japonica rice has risen to 16.8 yuan. There is also a tendency to continue to rise. In addition, the price of flour has also risen to 3.8 yuan per bag. Therefore, the general public has become more and more panicked these days, and most of them have adopted a diet of frugality and changed to cooking thin gruel to fill their stomachs. If this continues, the future of the people's food is unimaginable.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The hunt for bandit leaders by the defense corps was unsuccessful. After the bandit Mao Xueqin was executed, Lu Zhanggen of San Guan Quan’an Village near the city took over the disturbances. Although the county offered a reward of 500 yuan, it was difficult to capture him. On the evening of the 17th, the Zhouzhuang defense corps, based on a report from a Mr. Lu, discovered that Li Ruren's family in Xiaobaifeng, west of Zhouzhuang, had been buying two yuan worth of opium and meat dishes daily. It was then learned that the bandit Lu Zhanglin was staying at Li's house and had an affair with his daughter, Zhangdi. The defense corps, along with Xu Xiaochuan, the leader of the first police squad, rushed to Li's house at about 3:00 AM on the 18th, surrounded the house, and broke down the door. They found Li Ruren's daughter looking flustered and seized a Dragon Beard Grass hat, which was identified as not belonging to a local. Jiang Jinbao, a member of the corps, searched the loft and was shot in the arm by a hidden bandit and fell down. The bandit also fled. Later, in Zhou Xuelin's woodpile, they found a bandit who resisted with a gun and was shot dead on the spot. In the house, they captured a bandit named Zhu Kunrui, who was part of Lu's guard. Lu's mistress, Li Zhangdi (23 years old), and her father, Li Ruren, were also found. All were taken to the Zhouzhuang corps headquarters and are scheduled to be handed over to the county today. Yesterday morning, the county government was contacted by phone, and they sent Yang Cheng, an investigating official, and Cao, a forensic examiner, to Xiaobaifeng to examine the bandit's body. Seventy-one silver dollars were found and immediately rewarded to the defense corps members. They returned to the city in the evening.</p>
<p>A threatening letter occurred in the city. Zhao Zhongwei, in Huoyixiang in front of the city gate, received a threatening letter from bandits a few days ago, demanding 500 silver dollars. He was instructed to send a young man wearing a bamboo cloth long gown to wait at the second pavilion in Shoushan Park with the money by the 18th, or else his grandson, Longsun, would be kidnapped. After the Public Security Bureau learned of this, Director Li personally led plainclothes patrol officers to guard and patrol the park from morning to night yesterday, but found nothing. Also, Hua Chengzhu, who runs a cloth factory outside the south gate, also received a threatening letter a few days ago, demanding 1,000 silver dollars within three days. If he refused, his son, Zhongyao, would be secretly captured. Threatening cases have been occurring in the city area in recent days, causing anxiety among merchants and residents.</p>

Both sides exchanged fire across the river for an hour before the bandits retreated. Initially, the bandits outnumbered the defense corps members, and the situation was very dangerous. Fortunately, local residents came out to cheer them on, boosting the morale of the corps members, which allowed them to turn danger into safety.</p>

Because the Ministry of Finance instructed the salt tax in Liangzhe and the five prefectures of Jiangsu to be lent to a banking group, Liangzhe was assigned 3 million yuan. A meeting was convened on the 15th to discuss this. The outcome was that everyone thought the amount was too large and difficult to bear. However, the merchants should abide by the loan requirements. A representative was nominated to negotiate with the Transport Office, requesting them to transfer it to the merchants. If it can be slightly reduced, they will do their best to raise the funds.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang army's pacification of Zheng Zhangda is a major problem. Zheng Zhangda, the leader of the Henan bandit gang in the Huzhou area, has been weakened since being suppressed by the military and police. With the guarantee of local people, the bandit suppression headquarters in the Huzhou area handled the pacification. After forwarding it to the Security Department for review, it is now reported that the department requires both suppression and pacification to be carried out simultaneously and must be submitted to the bandit suppression headquarters of the three provinces for approval. A decision cannot be made at this time.</p>

<p>A suspect is caught in the Baimahu kidnapping case. After the kidnapping and murder case occurred at Chunhui Middle School in Baimahu, Yiting, Wu, the commander of the Sixth Regiment of the Baiguan Security Team, secretly ordered the troops stationed in Yuyao and Shangyu counties to strictly investigate. The day before yesterday afternoon, the train inspector on the train from Yongkai Cao found a passenger in the third-class carriage who looked suspicious. Under questioning, the old man claimed to be from Zhanglu, named Chen Huaicha, and made a living by fortune-telling. The rest of his words were ambiguous. The train inspector sent Chen to the Sixth Regiment Headquarters of the Baiguan Security Team for review.</p>
<p>A fire near the Lion Bridge. The Senmao firewood shop in front of the old Dongyue Temple on Lion Bridge in Ningbo City, opened by Fei Axu from Yuyao, has been open for several months. Unexpectedly, the fire was caused the night before when cooking dinner, leaving firewood piles. At about 11 o'clock, it suddenly burst into flames. At that time, the shop owner Fei and his wife and the shop staff were fast asleep. The detective team stationed in Dongyue Temple spotted it, knocked on the door and shouted, and Fei woke up. However, the fire had already broken through the roof. All the water associations heard the alarm and rushed to rescue. After about an hour, the fire was extinguished. Only one building and one flat house of the Senmao shop where the fire broke out were burned down, with an estimated loss of more than 300 yuan. One building of the Futa South Goods Shop and one building of the Wang Guanji General Merchandise Shop in the lane next door were burned. Yesterday, a document has been prepared to send Fei to the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<p>The Yin Zhen Ci Highway project is contracted. The bidding for the Yin Zhen Ci Highway project opened on May 17. The lowest prices for earthwork were offered by Liang Gong Xie Xing San Xing, and the unit prices for bridges and culverts were more or less in line with San Xing. The prices offered by other businesses for various other projects were too high and did not qualify. The first, second, and third sections of the earthwork project have now been contracted to Liang Gong, the fourth section to San Xing, and the fifth section to Xie Xing. In addition, the bridge and culvert project in the fourth section will be contracted to San Xing. Tenders will be invited again for the remaining bridge and culvert sections, as well as road office buildings and other projects.</p>
<p>Two foreigners, habitual thieves of silver dollars. Two men from Luzon, Neda Shi Bairo Tuo Shi, went to Chen Shuntai Leather Shoe Store in Fangjingtou at about 9:00 AM yesterday to buy leather shoes, taking the opportunity to steal 35 silver dollars. They also went to the Meihua Lee Clock Shop on Dongmen Street to buy a luminous watch and stole 25 silver dollars. They also went to the Taifeng South Goods Store and stole 22 jiao in the same way. Afterwards, the shop assistants of Chen Shuntai and Meihua Lee discovered that the silver dollars had been stolen and tracked them to the outside of the South Gate, where they were all captured and sent to the First District First Branch Office before being transferred to the local court for punishment according to the law.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Continued report on the kidnapping of the principal and others at Chunhui Middle School. It was reported that the principal, teachers, and three students of Chunhui Middle School in Baimahu were kidnapped on the evening of the 15th. According to the subsequent news, there are similarities and differences with the previous report. The following is a summary of the facts. It can be concluded that the kidnappers came specifically to kidnap Fan Shoukang and Jing Hengyi. On the 15th, the high school students held a graduation ceremony, so there was a recreational performance in the evening. All the teachers finished dinner and were resting in their dormitories. Only Principal Fan Shoukang and General Affairs Director Zhang Yuwen were still eating. The kidnappers not only armed the gatekeepers outside the school but also broke in in two groups. One group mistakenly entered the private room of Jiang Yishi, the Director of Student Affairs, and asked if the principal was there. Jiang reprimanded them and drove them out. Another group broke into the bedroom of chemistry teacher Wu Minxing and asked where Mr. Jing Hengyi lived. Wu told them that it was across the street. At that time, Jing was upstairs. At first, he mistakenly thought that students were coming to invite him to give a lecture. Then he heard a loud knocking on the door downstairs. He realized that something was wrong and quickly locked the double doors of the calligraphy and painting room and hid in the small bedroom behind the room. Before he could lock it, the kidnappers broke into the outer room and searched it without success. Jing then fled from the small bedroom to the large bedroom and tightly closed the double doors. Unexpectedly, the bandits entered the small bedroom again. Jing quickly went downstairs to the wood room and hid himself with firewood, and was spared. The bandits mistakenly thought that Wu Minxing was Jing himself, so they took him away. Just then, a student named Xia Naihua (also known as Tingcai) asked Jing to give a lecture and encountered the bandits, so he was kidnapped together. At the same time, the bandits also kidnapped Fan Shoukang. Fan was still wearing slippers. Because the change happened suddenly, he allowed the bandits to take him away. His shoes were abandoned halfway in Yang Xu'ao and were picked up by soldiers from the tracking security team. As for the deceased Yu Shifa, who had recently been working as an undercover agent for the Sixth Regiment, he encountered bandits when he returned home with a friend, Yang. He was shot dead. A few hours before the kidnapping, his wife was at home when several people from Shengxian with strange movements suddenly came and asked about Shifa's whereabouts. She replied that he was not there and they left disappointed. According to locals, when Shifa encountered the bandits, the bandits only said, "Shifa, you're here," and then shot him dead. Yang was also shot once. The bullet penetrated from below and exited from the back of his head. When he was taken to Datong Hospital, he was barely breathing and his life was in danger. The county government, in addition to sending the county defense team to Liang'ao and other places to investigate, sent a telegram to the provincial government on the 17th together with the Education Bureau, instructing the troops in various counties to cooperate in the search and rescue efforts.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The county government investigates gold ore outcrops. Gold ore outcrops were discovered in Tianzhu Mountain near Xintata, Xiaoshan. The owner of the mountain took samples to Shanghai to find a way to evaluate and excavate them. It is now reported that after learning of this, the county government believed that our country lacked experience in mining and would inevitably fail if we were to act rashly. It specifically ordered the Yiqiao Public Security Bureau to conduct a detailed investigation. If gold ore outcrops are indeed discovered, the county government should be notified to hire professional technicians, develop strict plans, and find ways to excavate them for the benefit of the project.</p>
<p>The river embankment project is completed. The flood relief emergency committee was organized in Hehang Changshan Daidui three villages of Xiaoshan to prevent floods. It engaged in flood prevention projects and recruited workers to repair the river embankment there as a work-for-relief measure. Since construction began, the three sections of the Sixteen Mu, Tongjia Weir, and Yangshu Ridge projects have been completed. The construction costs include Sixteen Mu at 2,682 yuan, six jiao and six fen, Tongjia Weir at 2,547 yuan, two jiao, seven fen and seven li, and Yangshu Ridge at 6,159 yuan, nine jiao, three fen and eight li. A detailed list has now been prepared and submitted to the Relief Committee for verification.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Township autonomy is being planned and implemented. In Shaoxing, the township autonomy case is being handled by County Magistrate Tang, who divided the entire county into ten districts and organized district offices, all of which have been established. It is now necessary to plan for township citizen registration and oath-taking. The township autonomy implementation law and the election provisional rules have been ordered to be forwarded by the district chiefs to the township preparatory offices to announce to the residents for implementation.</p>

<p>(Hu Shuyi)</p>
<p>The next day, the city government continued to invite me to visit the scenic spots and social undertakings in the city, including three parks: Tsurumai, Nakamura, and Nagoya Mountain, with Tsurumai Park being the largest, covering 7,934 tsubo. It was opened in the 40th year of Meiji and has buildings such as a concert hall and a fountain. Nakamura Park has memorials to Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Kato Kiyomasa, making it a historical and archaeological site. The most noteworthy social undertakings are the city-operated residences, i.e., residences for the common people, of which there are ten, with a total of 281 households, and three job placement offices: Central, Atsuta, and Chikusa, with the Central Job Placement Office being the most complete. In addition to job placement, it also has a daily labor placement office, a shared dormitory, a shared barber shop, and a public dining hall. I visited the Central Job Placement Office and was guided by the director to visit various departments and offices. According to him, every morning from 6:00 to 7:00, about 3,000 to 4,000 laborers come to the office to wait for work. After 7:00, they can all be assigned to work in various places in the area. These laborers are all short-term workers paid by the day. Any citizen who wants to hire short-term workers can notify the labor placement office by telephone every other day with the number of people and gender, and they can get appropriate labor. How convenient it is! The shared dormitory is the only place for the general poor to stay. It only costs 50 cents per day to stay overnight and eat three meals. The cleanliness of the dining hall and the tidiness of the dormitory have extremely precise regulations, benefiting the common people in every possible way. The stability of social order may be due to this. In addition, there are also nurseries and free clinics. Children over the age of two can be sent to the nursery for care, and parents can focus on work without the burden of housework. The nursery has nannies and doctors and has appropriate games and precise health care. There are four or five of these nurseries and free clinics in the city, all set up for the poor. The most impressive thing I visited that day was the emphasis on the lives of the poor in social undertakings. (Written in Nagoya) At 3:30 PM on the 3rd, I took an express train to Kyoto with Mr. Lüqin and his wife. The scenery seen on both sides of the railway is similar to that of the Jiangnan region of Jiangsu Province. However, every mountain is afforested with dense shade and green trees. The scenery of early summer is very lovely. The dense distribution of power lines between villages shows the development of the Japanese electricity industry, which can be seen in one class. From these few points, the rise and fall of the country can be predicted. There are many farmers coming and going in the fields, harvesting wheat and transplanting rice, with different work. Most of the fields are small and square, and many women are farming, which seems to be a small-scale farming system. At 5:30 PM, I arrived at Kyoto Station and stayed at a Western-style hotel. The next morning, I went to the city government with Mr. Jin and Lüqin to visit. Mr. Jin investigated the city's finances, and I asked about the city's educational facilities. Mr. Natsume Yasukage, the chief of the secretary's office and the tourism section of the city government, came out to see us and invited the chief of the statistics section, the chief of the finance section, and the chief of the school affairs section to talk. He gave us five books: 1. Kyoto City Situation, 2. Abstractions of Kyoto Municipal Statistics, 3. Summary of School Affairs in Kyoto City, 4. Kyoto City Financial Overview, 5. Kyoto Cyclorama, etc., mostly written in English, probably given to Westerners who come to Japan for inspection. We don't understand Japanese, so we also talked in English, which is not isolated. The Japanese city government is named the City Office, which is an organ for citizen autonomy and service, guided by the prefecture or county. The completeness of the city government's organization and the diligence of the staff can be seen from the city government's organizational chart and various statistics. I agreed with the chief of the school affairs section on a plan to inspect the schools in Kyoto City and was given a free city tram pass, which can be used everywhere. Then, the city government assigned a greeter to accompany us to visit the Kyoto Prefecture government. The school inspector came out to see us and gave us books such as Kyoto Prefecture Administration Overview, Kyoto Prefecture Situation Overview, Kyoto Education Expenditure Overview, and Kyoto Prefecture School Affairs Overview. He described in detail the standards for the treatment of elementary school teachers, the methods of encouragement, and the annual salary increase. He knew that the six-year common elementary school in Japan is the length of compulsory education. At present, only one or two out of every hundred school-age children in the country do not attend elementary school. As for children with disabilities or blindness, special schools are set up to educate them. After graduating from elementary school, those who want to make a living have job placement offices provided by the government to introduce them to jobs. There are jobs for all who are literate and have no illiteracy. Is this where the improvement of social standards and the safety of social order lie? Then, Mr. Kinmatsu Enjiro was assigned by the city government to accompany us to visit two municipal schools, Jōnan and Toyen. Jōnan School is located in the central Kyoto district of the city and has four departments: elementary school, higher elementary school, kindergarten, and handicraft school. The annual expenses are about 28,000 for the elementary school department, more than 5,600 for the kindergarten, and more than 1,700 for the handicraft department. There are currently about 700 students and 35 teachers. It has a city-wide conservation association, which means that there are more than 30 kindergartens participating in the early childhood education research association. Then we visited Kyoto Women's Normal School. The school is located in the suburbs and the students must all live in the dormitory. There is a large sports field with perfect sports equipment. The dormitory and the self-study room are combined, clean and precise. Each department of the school is jointly responsible for cleaning by the students and teachers. Each room is assigned one teacher and four or five students to be responsible for sweeping. The affiliated elementary school and kindergarten are relatively far away, so we did not visit them due to time constraints. (In Kyoto)</p>

<h3>Reorganizing Elementary Education Funding</h3>
<p>Eliminating Fictitious Collection and Actual Expenditure…Increasing Educational Efficiency, Raising Funding Standards…Stabilizing Teachers' Livelihoods "Zhenjiang Correspondence" The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, recognizing that elementary education in various counties is suffering from empty funding sources, unbounded expansion, and a lack of standards, leading to fictitious collection and actual expenditure, accumulated debts, causing panic in teachers' lives, and bringing the enterprise to the brink of bankruptcy, has issued an order to implement measures for review and reorganization. The text of the order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Order for Implementation: Upon investigation, the standards for the distribution of funds for reorganizing elementary education in various counties, including advanced and elementary experimental primary schools and central primary schools, as well as the outlines for the preparation of the 19th year educational budget for each county, have been previously ordered by this department to be followed and recorded. The reasons for this department's regulation of the aforementioned standards have been explained in detail in previous instructions. Fearing that some may not fully understand, this is reiterated in detail as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Funding is the mother of enterprise. Without stable funding, the enterprise is equivalent to emptiness. If the expansion of the enterprise is unbounded and lacks standards, the foundation of funding will be shaken, and local education in the respective counties will immediately fall into an irrecoverable abyss. This problem is most evident in places such as Rugao and Wu County. Expenditures cannot be reduced even by a fraction, while income sources cannot be fully secured. Fictitious collection and actual expenditure create a self-inflicted trap that inevitably leads to bankruptcy. Therefore, the primary objective in preparing the 19th year budget is to ensure that income and expenditure are balanced.</p>
<p>(2) The principle of educational efficiency is to always strive for maximum efficiency with minimal funding. Especially in today's financially difficult times, the average cost per student must be minimized, while the average number of students taught by each teacher must be maximized. In various counties of this province, it is common to find primary school classes with only ten or twenty students, and even as few as three or five, while each class often has more than one teacher. This clearly violates the principle of educational efficiency. Therefore, the number of students per class and the number of teachers per class must be clearly defined. This is the intention behind it. (3) The funding figures for the standards prescribed this time are based on the current expenditure amounts of each county, with appropriate distribution. The maximum limit for elementary primary schools is set at 350 yuan, which is higher than the "annual elementary primary school funding of 280 yuan" resolved by the Second National Education Conference. The funding for advanced primary schools, experimental primary schools, and central primary schools has been carefully considered and specified separately, with the aim of enabling the entire province to implement these standards and maximize benefits. (4) Primary school teachers bear heavy responsibilities, but their treatment is too meager. This department is deeply concerned about this. However, given the financial situation in various counties of this province, which is already so strained, and the fact that both the national and provincial treasuries are equally depleted, the original educational enterprises in each county cannot be suspended in order to improve teachers' treatment. Furthermore, there are so many out-of-school children in the locality. After careful consideration, this reorganization plan was devised. On the one hand, it restricts the extravagance of funding, and on the other hand, it strives to stabilize teachers' salaries. The reductions this time are in maintenance costs, but not in teachers' salaries. If the number of students per class meets the standards, not only will there be no reduction, but Instruction No. 855 of this department clearly emphasizes the principle of rewarding meritorious service with additional pay. It is hoped that as a result of this reorganization, if the autumn harvest is not too poor and income and expenditure can be balanced, the salaries of primary school teachers in each school will no longer suffer the misfortune of accumulated arrears for months.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the comparison of the treatment of rural primary school teachers and urban primary school teachers, the current practice in various counties is often unequal. The mission of rural primary school teachers is no less important than that of urban teachers, and their situation may even be more difficult. If their treatment is not appropriately improved, the goal of universal education will be further away. Therefore, when preparing the 19th year budget, the treatment of rural and urban teachers must be equalized. In summary, in these times of financial hardship for educational funding in various counties, rather than engaging in extravagance and perishing together, it is better to comprehensively assess the facts, endure the pain for a moment, so that finances are used to their fullest and people are employed to their fullest, and schools achieve their maximum effectiveness. All these measures to repair the fold after losing the sheep are bitter and arduous plans, necessary to ensure that funding is available and that teachers' salaries can be stabilized, and to avoid bankruptcy at the brink of danger, so that the educational enterprise can gradually develop. It is expected that the bureau director will promptly print and widely distribute this order with clear explanations, so that the principals and teachers of elementary schools in the county will fully understand. Furthermore, it is expected that the 19th year budget for the county will be prepared and submitted for review within the deadline. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Obligatory Education Statistics</h3>
<p>Public Elementary Schools Show Progress Compared to Previous Years</p>
<p>Both the Number of Classes and Children in Private Elementary Schools Have Decreased</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial United Office for the Preparation of Obligatory Education has successively compiled four types of statistical tables: the 17th year overview of obligatory education in Jiangsu counties, the statistical table of qualifications of elementary school teachers, and the statistical table of the number of children and the amount of funding for elementary schools in Jiangsu counties over the years. These were printed and distributed to the counties for reference and submitted to the Ministry of Education for instruction to forward to the provincial and municipal education departments for reference and imitation. Recently, the office has continued to compile the 18th year (this year) overview of obligatory education in Jiangsu counties and compared it with the 17th year to clarify progress and decline. The overview of obligatory education in 61 counties and Suzhou City as statistically compiled is extracted below:</p>
<p>(1) Number of schools: 8,284 schools (8,180 schools in the previous year)</p>
<p>(2) Number of classes: 13,825 classes (13,512 classes in the previous year)</p>
<p>(3) Number of teachers: 19,637 people (19,401 people in the previous year)</p>
<p>(4) Number of children: 547,103 people (507,644 people in the previous year)</p>
<p>(5) Amount of funding: 4,446,571 yuan (4,139,326 yuan in the previous year)</p>
<p>According to the above figures, each class accommodates an average of 39.57 children, requires 1.23 teachers, and needs 321.63 yuan in funding. Each teacher educates an average of 27.86 children, and each child costs 8.13 yuan per year. Although the total number of each item has increased compared to the previous year, the increase or decrease varies greatly when comparing individual counties and cities. The number of schools increased in 36 counties and decreased in 24 counties and 1 city. The number of classes increased in 40 counties and 1 city and decreased in 20 counties. The number of teachers increased in 42 counties and 1 city and decreased in 19 counties. The number of children increased in 50 counties and 1 city and decreased in 11 counties. The amount of funding increased in 44 counties and 1 city and decreased in 17 counties. No county or city remained unchanged. Moreover, the increase in each item is less than in the previous year. For example, the increase in funding in the previous year was 907,214 yuan, while this year it is only 307,245 yuan. The increase in students in the previous year was 42,657 people, while this year it is only 39,459 people. In particular, compared to the previous year, private elementary schools have decreased by 88 schools, 118 classes, 4 teachers, and 2,182 children, while funding has increased by 11,780 yuan. However, in terms of educational efficiency, it feels like a decline.</p>

<p>Order Issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education</p>
<h3>Outline of Summer School Measures for Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructed the county education bureaus to implement the outline of measures for summer training courses for elementary school teachers in each county, and to submit detailed regulations for review and approval. The county education bureaus are ordered to implement the order. It is noted that the former University Council, in order to improve the knowledge and skills of primary and secondary school teachers in various places, had formulated measures for the establishment of summer training courses for primary and secondary school teachers, and ordered the Central University to instruct the education bureaus of various counties to comply. These summer training courses can not only be used during vacations to allow teachers to improve their knowledge, but also provide an opportunity to jointly study and solve difficult problems in teaching. This is truly a win-win situation. At a time when local education is striving for reorganization, the knowledge and ability of elementary school teachers are particularly important. This department has revised the nine-article outline of measures for the establishment of summer training courses for elementary school teachers in various counties of Jiangsu Province based on the current situation, as a standard. In addition to separate orders, the outline is copied and distributed, and it is expected that detailed regulations will be drafted and submitted for approval, and that it will be held promptly during the summer vacation. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<p>Outline of Measures (1) The purpose of the summer training courses for elementary school teachers in each county is to use the vacation to improve educational knowledge, improve educational methods, and expound on the Three People's Principles of Education.

<h3>Ministry of Education's Instruction Regarding Attention to Symbols</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently instructed the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, saying: "The Executive Yuan's instruction states: 'The National Government ordered that the Central Executive Committee informed the Standing Committee that it had decided to change phonetic alphabet to phonetic symbols, and that it should be taught and practiced together. Please follow and implement this instruction.' The Ministry has now formulated the Regulations for the Promotion Committee of National Language Phonetic Symbols and organized this committee, and the regulations have been promulgated, ordering the educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities to organize this committee and promote the National Language Phonetic Symbols. The committee previously planned to establish offices in various provinces and cities stationed in Beijing, with the same nature. According to the current situation, there is no need to establish them. At a time when the National Government is issuing orders to abolish the offices of various ministries stationed in Shanghai, all offices of the committee that have been established in various places should be abolished together. Furthermore, the committee's office in Beijing has a National Language Phonetic Symbol Training Institute in Beijing. Now that the office has been abolished, the training institute should apply to the local educational administrative organs for approval in accordance with the measures for establishing academic groups, and please forward the instructions to be followed."</p>
<p>Another order to the Nanjing Special City Education Bureau stated: "The Huaiqing Bridge National Goods Exhibition Hall in Beijing recently established a National Language Phonetic Symbol Training Institute and sent its constitution, stating that the Beijing Office of the Ministry's National Language Unification Preparatory Committee is its establishing organ. Now that the office has been ordered by the Ministry to be abolished by the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, the training institute should apply to the local educational administrative organs for approval in accordance with the measures for the management of educational institutions and academic groups. Please forward the instructions to be followed."</p>
<h3>All Schools in Hunan Province Must Close by a Deadline</h3>
<p>| Before the 20th of This Month |</p>
<p>In Times of War, Education Cannot Be Considered</p>
<p>All School Funds Have No Source</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence. Hunan Province's educational funding, after years of running and appeals by people in the education sector, has been allowed by the government to allocate a salt tax surcharge of 5 jiao per bag. Therefore, since the 18th year, it has gradually entered a sustainable state from the most difficult period. All public and private schools are also striving to increase the number of classes, and obligatory education is being actively promoted. However, the war occurred, the treasury was empty, and there was no tax revenue. The funds for each school, such as the Provincial No. 1 Industrial School, No. 1 Normal School, No. 1 Middle School, No. 1 Vocational School, No. 2 Middle School, and No. 1 Agricultural School, etc., monthly recurring expenses range from 5,000 to 6,000 yuan for many schools and 3,000 to 4,000 yuan for fewer schools. No funds are available, and I feel the national crisis deeply. In addition, because the army is clustered in the provincial capital, the original barracks are insufficient to allocate. Many schools are stationed in, and because the summer vacation is approaching, classes cannot be suspended. If classes are suspended, it is feared that the school site will be empty and dilapidated, and there will be more troops stationed, and all equipment will be damaged. Therefore, although the current situation is extremely difficult to maintain, we are still trying to find ways to keep the string song unbroken. On the one hand, the principals of various schools were assembled to meet with the authorities, who all replied that education could not be considered in wartime and could be suspended. Therefore, it is even more difficult to proceed. A general meeting was convened and it was resolved that (1) all public and private schools would be released early for the holidays, and the final examination would be held immediately. (2) The War Zone Political Affairs Committee is requested to maintain and issue food expenses in particular when there is no other way. (3) It is requested that the Political Affairs Committee not allow troops to be stationed in schools. (4) After the schools are closed for the holidays, make up classes will be opened within the possible scope, one to preserve the school equipment and the other to allow students to continue their studies. After the decision, they immediately proceeded on separate routes. The Political Affairs Committee proposed discussions when the committee was held at 2 p.m. on the 15th, and it was decided that (1) the war period was expensive, and education funds could not be raised, and it was just right for the summer vacation to be approaching, so it was ordered to close in advance and end on the 20th of this month. (2) The First Normal School will be given 1,000 yuan for meals (more than 2,000 yuan per month) to be allocated by the Provincial River Customs Office. Other schools will be designated to allocate 2/10 of the expenses that each school should receive from the land tax item from Changsha and Hengzhou counties to help end the current schools. They are holding final exams and are extremely busy.</p>

<h3>Order from the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<p>Junior High Schools Should Adopt Domestic Language Textbooks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau ordered the middle schools in the city: For the purpose of compliance, the bureau previously ordered that junior high school students' foreign language proficiency should be promoted, and that all textbooks except foreign languages should not use foreign language textbooks, and ordered all middle schools to comply. The Ministry of Education was requested to notify the educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities to order all junior high schools across the country to comply. Now, the Ministry of Education's first order No. 1204 states that the report has been reviewed and approved. It is noted that this case previously approved a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, forwarding a copy of the Zhejiang Yin County Executive Committee's request to the Central Committee to order the Ministry of Education to issue a nationwide ban on foreign textbooks in middle schools and to use as many translations as possible. The report stated that textbooks of the same level, Chinese can be read at a glance, while foreign textbooks must be obscure and time-consuming and cannot be understood, which reduces the educational cost and wastes the energy and time of hundreds of thousands of students, which is a huge loss for the whole country. The Ministry previously replied that if foreign textbooks must be used in senior high schools due to the lack of appropriate textbooks in the country, it seems inappropriate to prohibit them in general. As for junior high schools, because students' foreign language proficiency is still immature, it is inappropriate to use foreign originals in many cases. All textbooks except foreign language textbooks should use domestic language textbooks. Now, according to the previous report, the educational administrative organs of all provinces and cities should be notified to order all junior high schools across the country to comply. All middle schools in this city are ordered to comply with this order.</p>

<h3>Foreign Company Registration Issues</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Measures</p>
<p>Branches established in China</p>
<p>Should register in accordance with Chinese laws</p>
<p>Since the case of the Japanese firm Mitsui suing Hong Cangting for guarantee occurred in this city, lawyer Zhang Rongxi raised the issue of the legal status of foreign companies that have not registered in China. Consequently, many foreign businesses have inquired with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce about registration procedures. The office responded that all Chinese and foreign commercial companies must register in accordance with company law to be equally protected, just like trademark registration, which is treated equally regardless of whether it is Chinese or foreign. However, foreign businesses were particularly interested in knowing the exact amount of registered capital. The office reported the situation to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions, and the reply received yesterday was as follows (excerpt): All companies established within China, whether Chinese or foreign, must apply for registration in accordance with Chinese company law in order to obtain legal person status. If a foreign company's head office is located abroad and was established according to foreign law, it should apply for branch registration in accordance with Chinese law when establishing a branch in China.

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Smuggled Salt Announcement</h3>
<p>Since 1927, in the anti-smuggling areas of the five counties of Jiangsu Province, there have been instances of well-known salt smugglers from Huaihai using the guise of refugees to transport and sell large quantities of smuggled salt, resulting in an oversupply of smuggled salt and sluggish official sales, which has greatly affected the state's salt tax revenue. Finance Minister Song Ziwen, recognizing this situation, issued an announcement strictly prohibiting such activities. The announcement is transcribed below: It is hereby noted that salt tax is a major source of national revenue and is of utmost importance. Recently, the sales figures in the Jiangsu province have been abnormally sluggish. After investigation, it was found that this is due to a general practice of private smugglers who use the guise of refugees fleeing famine to carry large quantities of smuggled salt, which they sell along the way, thereby affecting official sales. This is no minor issue. In addition to notifying the Jiangsu Provincial Government and ordering all anti-smuggling bureaus to investigate and arrest offenders at any time, all merchants and citizens are hereby notified that the sale of smuggled salt is a serious violation of the law, and those who rely on their numbers to force their way through will be punished by law. If they are indeed refugees passing through checkpoints along the way, they should immediately submit to inspection and must not allow outlaws to mingle among them, using the guise of refugees to transport smuggled salt in an attempt to profit. Those who dare to disobey will be treated as private smugglers and severely punished according to the law. Be forewarned. Let everyone obey and not violate this order. This is a special announcement. Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, National Government.</p>

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Raising Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Notification to Rice Merchants...Admonition to Rice Dealers</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has discovered that Changbang rice merchants Yin Xiaqing, Zhu Genrong, Wang Sibao, Zhu Jinbao, Lu Guaner, Cao Xingnan, Zou Liangbao, Zhou Genda, Lu Zhongshan, Yao Genlin, Gu Quanfu, Qiu Xiangji, Xu Asi, Cao Didi, and Shen Darong, a total of fifteen individuals, are suspected of hoarding rice and disrupting the price limit. It issued a notification ordering them to sell all their rice at or below the price limit of twenty-one yuan per stone before June 21st. If they fail to sell by the deadline, the Bureau of Social Affairs will designate rice shops to sell the rice on their behalf, and all losses and expenses incurred as a result will be borne by the rice merchants. It is also reported that the Bureau has summoned rice dealers such as Zhang Chu to the bureau for admonishment in recent days. Yesterday, rice inspectors were seen inspecting the selling prices at a certain rice shop, reportedly due to the high rice price incident.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing Market Prices for Flour and Wheat</h3>
<p>Orders Flour and Wheat Exchanges to Quickly Devise Measures</p>
<p>After the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs strictly investigated the flour and wheat market situation, prices once fell. However, the market saw prices rise again yesterday. At a time when food is scarce, everyone should work together to maintain stability. Moreover, new wheat is currently entering the market, so prices should not be rising in this manner. Exchanges and others are still using imported wheat as an excuse. However, there is no need for imported wheat during this period, and it has nothing to do with gold prices. Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs again sent personnel to the flour and wheat exchanges to investigate and also issued an order to the two exchanges, stating: It has been found that wheat is entering the market and prices should not be so high. The Bureau has previously sent personnel to instruct the exchanges to devise measures to stabilize prices, but the exchanges have failed to implement them effectively, and prices are still rising, which is also affecting the rice market. If such harm to the people's food supply is not stopped, there will be no end in sight. The Bureau has dispatched staff member Sun Ke to deliver this order. The exchanges are hereby ordered to comply and quickly devise measures to stabilize prices. If they continue to delay, the Bureau will take appropriate action to protect the people's livelihoods and will punish those who disobey the order. The exchanges are also ordered to work with staff member Sun Ke to investigate the transaction volumes of each broker, as well as the names and customer codes of large-scale buyers and bring them to the Bureau for verification. This order is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Delegate Assembly</h3>
<p>Preparations before the Meeting</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee is scheduled to hold a city-wide member delegate assembly on the 21st. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The following is a record of the various news items from yesterday:</p>
<p>Delegate qualifications are re-examined. The delegate qualification review committee, organized by the association, held its first meeting on the 17th. For store members, the review standard is that, in accordance with the regulations of the Chamber of Commerce Law, any commercial legal person or store in the city that has no same-trade business or, although there is same-trade business, there is no organization of the same-trade association, may independently join the association in accordance with the law. However, the interpretation of "although there is same-trade business, there is no organization of the same-trade association" refers to those who have the potential to organize the same-trade association in accordance with the law (that is, there must be seven or more same-trade businesses) but are unwilling to organize or have not yet organized, or only limited to those who have less than seven same-trade businesses and cannot organize the same-trade association in accordance with the law. There is no clear provision in the law for this matter. Therefore, the first delegate qualification review meeting must handle it according to the first interpretation. Unexpectedly, on the 18th, the association received approval No. 10894 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, clearly instructing that "same-trade business in the same area" referred to in Article 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law refers to those with less than seven businesses. If there are seven or more, they should immediately organize the same-trade association in accordance with the law, and the association will send representatives to join the Chamber of Commerce. The regulations for store members in this article cannot be applied, and independent joining is not allowed. According to this Ministry approval, there are clear restrictions on the Chamber of Commerce store members. The delegate qualification review committee specially convened a second meeting yesterday to delete those that were deemed qualified in the first review but conflicted with the Ministry approval. The notice has been sent to each store by separate letter.</p>
<p>Distributing delegate attendance certificates. The association sent a letter to each delegate yesterday, stating, "Dear Delegate, This association is scheduled to hold a Same-Trade Association Delegate Assembly on June 21st, which has been reported to the National Government Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for approval, and all associations, companies, and merchants have been notified to send representatives on record. To ensure formal meeting procedures, all delegates attending on that day must bring the attendance certificate issued by this association for verification. The printed attendance certificates are enclosed with this letter. Please check and receive them. Please bring this attendance certificate and attend the meeting at 9:00 AM on June 21st. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Bank representatives should be sent by the association. The association previously asked whether banks should send representatives to join the Chamber of Commerce in accordance with Article 11 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, or whether they can join independently according to the example of store members. After that, the request was forwarded to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for verification. Now, the association has received a reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which states, "We acknowledge your telegram. After investigation, 'although there is a same-trade business, there is no organization of the same-trade association' as mentioned in Article 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law refers to those with less than seven businesses in the same area. If there are more than seven banks in the city, they should immediately organize a same-trade association in accordance with the Law on Same-Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce, and the association will send representatives to join the Chamber of Commerce. The provisions for store members in this article cannot be applied, and independent joining to comply with the legal system and avoid disputes. According to the situation in the telegram, you should immediately be notified." The association has notified the Banking Association, and all members of the association will send 21 representatives to join the association in accordance with the regulations. It has also been resolved at the 55th Standing Committee Meeting of the association that it should be reorganized into the Shanghai Banking Association in accordance with Article 1 of the Law on Same-Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce and a special letter will be sent to the association for verification.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs suppresses the Insurance Association. The Insurance Association has been resolved by the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Conference to legally correct the name to the Insurance Same-Trade Association. After sending a letter to inform them, the association did not accept the guidance and returned the original letter. The association sent a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs asking for instructions on how to handle it. Then, a letter was received from the Bureau of Social Affairs stating that it should be suppressed. The association immediately forwarded the letter to the Insurance Association for verification. The original letter stated, "After receiving your reply that the Insurance Association and the Shanghai Insurance Association, which was renamed from the Chinese Insurance Association, are the same in nature, both parties were summoned to the meeting to discuss the merger. It was unexpected that the Insurance Industry Branch Association moved its address, and the letter could not be sent. Another meeting was convened for all standing committee members of the Branch Association to come to the meeting for consultation, but no one attended. Upon review of the situation, it was impossible to reorganize it. Therefore, the 45th Standing Committee Meeting passed a resolution and sent a letter to the Shanghai Insurance Association to reorganize it into the Shanghai Insurance Same-Trade Association. It was unexpected that the association did not accept the reorganization letter and returned the letter each time. The 52nd Standing Committee Meeting then decided to state the situation of the association not accepting the guidance one by one and send a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to handle it in accordance with the law. Therefore, we recorded the case and hoped you would check and handle it accordingly." "Now, it has been found that although the Insurance Industry Branch Association is a merchants' group from the past, it has been reported to and approved by our bureau, but since the letter cannot be sent and no one attends the meeting, it is impossible to reorganize it, which is the actual situation. As for the Shanghai Insurance Same-Trade Association, it has not been reported for registration or approved by your association. Our bureau has no record to check. Now that your association has reorganized the Branch Association into a Same-Trade Association and it does not accept guidance, it cannot be recognized as a legal group according to current laws. In the future, if the association's branch association has any requests, our bureau will not accept them. In addition to forwarding the letter to the Citizens' Training Association for verification, we are responding to the letter accordingly and hope you will check it for your reference."</p>
<p>All Chinese Employees of Customs</p>
<h3>Oppose Simpson's Declaration</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Tianjin Times is Also Deeply Dissatisfied</p>
<p>All Chinese employees of the Shanghai Customs yesterday issued a declaration opposing Simpson's appointment as the Commissioner of Customs in Tianjin, stating, "Recently, the British national Simpson has been appointed as the Commissioner of Customs in Tianjin, which is an unprecedented change in the Customs. The fate of the country is at stake, and we cannot treat this as a minor local issue. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the country has been plagued by wars, but the country has not lost its credibility abroad and its financial resources have not been exhausted because of the Customs, which has seen increasing tax revenues. The Customs has been able to maintain finances in a non-corrupt manner because of its complete system. The spirit of the complete system is that it is subordinate to the government and is not affected by political tides, standing outside of all political and party disputes, with the sole mission of collecting taxes and maintaining national credibility. Employees are promoted annually, and promotions are based on performance. Positions are guaranteed, and everyone is honest and self-respecting. Only those with rich experience and decades of seniority can be promoted to the position of Customs Commissioner. Now, with Simpson, who has not been in the Customs for long and was dismissed from his position due to a case, being appointed to head the Tianjin Customs, anyone without any qualifications or experience can come to the Customs to work. Once this precedent is set, morale will be low, and all employees will have the mentality of only being there for a short time. The old malpractices of the Likin Bureau will reappear in the Customs. From now on, the Customs will inevitably be drawn into the whirlpool of all political changes. Once the complete system is broken, the impact will be more severe on industry and commerce, international trade will inevitably decline, and domestic and foreign credit will be fundamentally shaken, leading to bankruptcy. Moreover, since the recovery of customs rights, foreign employees in the Customs have been gradually reduced, and new employees have not been allowed to increase. This has been the result of years of struggle by our patriotic compatriots. If the Commissioner of Customs in Tianjin must be changed, we must choose a current Customs employee with seniority and good reputation to take on the important task. If it is not a Customs employee, then for the sake of the future of Customs administration and for the sake of the country's future, we will never cooperate with him. A person who has been dismissed for a long time, has no experience, and has always been strongly opposed to China's recovery of extraterritorial rights is even more difficult to acknowledge as the head of Customs. We swear to oppose it. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>According to a Chinese employee who spoke to the reporter, the newly appointed British Commissioner of Customs in Tianjin, Simpson, has stated since taking over the Tianjin Customs that Customs personnel must not leave their posts without authorization, or they will be shot without pardon, as reported by Reuters. The Beijing-Tianjin Times, published by the British, expressed deep dissatisfaction with Simpson's actions, saying that it was extremely unfortunate that the integrity of the Customs was destroyed by a British national. Moreover, there is an inside story, that is, Simpson's move is a retaliatory act. Before the庚子Incident, Simpson was a low-level employee of the Customs, but was later ordered to resign by He Zhan for a matter, and he still owes the Customs a certain amount of money, and the archives are still there. Therefore, Simpson now has the intention of making a comeback to avenge his previous shame.</p>
<h3>Obstacles Removed from Xiang River</h3>
<p>Chang-Yue Shipping Lane Can Now be Traversed</p>
<p>The Central Army has captured Changsha, and the remnants of Zhang Gui's forces have fled elsewhere. The blockade of the mouth of the Xiang River has been lifted. Because there are no more traces of the enemy on the section from Yuezhou to Changsha, and the naval vessels have sailed upriver, the obstacles previously set up were reportedly removed from both sides of the channel by the navy within a limited time each day, leaving the waterway open. All commercial vessels traveling through the channel will be temporarily led by naval vessels.</p>
<p>Changsha will resume shipping between Hunan and Hubei. The Changsha liner ships have been suspended for more than ten days since receiving orders to halt operations. Now that the Central Army has recovered Hunan Province, all foreigners who had taken refuge on the ships have returned to Changsha to live in peace. The Yuanjiang Maru and other ships of the Nisshin Company are planning to resume the Changsha route within the next day or two. Yesterday, a British ship went upriver from Shanghai, and nine pieces of cargo bound for Changsha have begun to be shipped from this port.</p>
<p>British troops escorting ships to Huangshigang, Huangzhou, and Daye. Since the implementation of the suspension of berthing and the suspension of passenger transport to these three ports by foreign ships from this port, British firms such as Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson in this port have consulted with the British Navy stationed in China to find a temporary protection method for the safety of ships traveling up and down the Yangtze River. It is reported that the British Navy has decided to send a platoon of fully armed naval personnel on each Yangtze River ship to escort it, but only from Hankou to Jiujiang. This has been implemented since the 15th. When a certain British ship that arrived in Shanghai this time passed through Huangshigang, the escorting British troops exchanged dozens of rifle shots with bandits on both sides of the river.</p>

<h3>Central Petition from the Match Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Regarding the Swedish Merchants' Aggression Against the Match Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Yingchang Match Workers' Union, the Hangzhou Guanghua Match Workers' Union, the Zhoupu Zhonghua Match Workers' Union, and the Suzhou Match Industry Union, recognizing the increasingly severe pressure exerted by Swedish merchants on our country's match industry, and recently their acquisition of the Suisheng Factory in Zhoujiadu for further aggression, jointly petitioned the central government on the previous day along with other match industry members from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The petition stated: "We submit this petition concerning foreign merchants establishing match factories in China, engaging in economic aggression, and endangering the lives of millions of match workers throughout the country. Having no alternative, we come to petition Your Honorable Ministries and Departments to provide assistance and relief, with the aim of aiding the survival of laborers. Our unions reported in November of the eighteenth year that Swedish matches were being imported in large quantities and sold at low prices, intensifying the aggression. We petitioned Your Honorable Ministries and Departments to devise methods of relief. We have recently learned that Swedish merchants have purchased the former site of the Japanese Suisheng Factory in Zhoujiadu, Shanghai, and acquired twenty to thirty *li* of land, creating an extremely large area. The factory is entirely equipped with machinery for production, without employing Chinese workers. The merchants regard Shanghai as the commercial center of our country, making sales and transportation extremely convenient. Establishing a factory there can deliver a death blow to our country's match industry, suddenly increasing the number of unemployed workers by millions, harming both the national economy and the people's livelihood. Their intentions are sinister and their aggression is fiercer than that of British and Japanese imperialism. Zhoujiadu is not a concession area, yet they dare to act so brazenly without any concern. If no intervention is made and they are allowed to continue their aggression, foreigners will inevitably follow suit and establish factories inland. At that time, our match industry will be the first to bear the brunt and be completely eliminated. We fear that it will be difficult for factories producing other national goods in China to survive, and how can the Premier's agricultural and industrial policies be developed? Our unions have learned that the factory is scheduled to begin operations on August 1st. Witnessing this situation, we are deeply distressed. The lives of workers are in imminent danger. We request Your Honorable Ministries and Departments to devise strict measures to stop this, and to instruct all levels of Party and government organs and organizations throughout the country to purchase domestic matches and resist foreign matches. Furthermore, Swedish match merchants established a factory in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, in June of the eighteenth year, which was prohibited by the Liaoning Provincial Government. Therefore, we earnestly request an investigation and strict prohibition to rescue our millions of match industry laborers from dire straits. In this environment, the capitalists are facing an imminent crisis of bankruptcy, and the laborers are facing a dead end of no survival. At this critical moment of life and death, we jointly appeal to Your Honorable Ministries and Departments, together with our Jiangsu and Zhejiang colleagues, to abide by the Premier's instructions, revive domestic industries, and solve the people's livelihood, in order to quickly provide relief and adopt practical measures to resist the establishment of factories by Swedish merchants. Otherwise, in order to fight for survival, our laborers will have no choice but to make great sacrifices and struggle. We respectfully request Your Honorable Ministries and Departments to provide assistance to extinguish the ambitions of Swedish merchants to establish factories inland. This will not only be the good fortune of our match industry laborers but also the blessing of the nation." Respectfully submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>Commercial Regulation Association</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestic Western-style Clothing Materials</h3>
<p>Letter to Relevant Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Commercial Regulation Association sent a letter yesterday to trade associations of woolen fabrics, cotton textiles, silk fabrics, etc., stating: "Dear Sirs, We received a letter today from the Western-style Clothing Trade Association of this city, stating, 'The raw materials used by our industry for woolen Western-style suits mostly come from abroad, which seems to contradict the principle of promoting domestic goods. However, we have never dared to lag behind others in our patriotic sentiments. It is only that there are no substitutes among domestic products for these raw materials. If we were to passively cease operations, it would cause a social and economic panic, which would be akin to throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Furthermore, the form and style of Western-style clothing are an advanced form of attire, so one cannot harshly criticize those who seek it. The only good solution is for domestic cotton, wool, hemp, silk, and other textile factories to quickly improve and imitate Western-style fabrics to supply our industry for use. Only with resistance can one speak of control. In this time of expensive gold and cheap silver, it is an excellent opportunity for Chinese textile businesses to compete.' These words were submitted to the Association. We believe that Western-style clothing has become quite popular and influential. To recover lost ground, one must select domestic materials carefully. However, it is not easy to find domestic materials suitable for tailoring Western-style clothing. The association's suggestion to improve and imitate Western-style fabrics for use is indeed an urgent matter. In this current of expensive gold and cheap silver, it is an especially good opportunity to promote domestic goods, and we must not be negligent or make mistakes. Therefore, we are submitting this information in separate letters, hoping that your association will convene members to discuss this together and strive to implement it without missing this excellent opportunity. We would be most grateful."</p>

However, as the opening is imminent, those who wish to participate should go quickly, lest they miss the opportunity. To provide preferential treatment for out-of-town manufacturers, the emporium has specially prepared dormitories for accommodation at no extra charge and has assigned personnel to receive all guests. Furthermore, the method of display in the exhibition area has also been changed to charge fees based on the size of the space. Detailed regulations are printed and will be sent upon request.</p>
<p>External Announcement</p>
<h3>Danger at Jigong Mountain and Guling</h3>
<p>Announcement to All Embassies to Inform Foreign Nationals to Take Note: Jigong Mountain in Henan and Guling in Jiangxi have long been popular summer resorts. Every year, many men and women from various countries visit these places to escape the heat. Currently, due to the unstable situation and the unpredictable activities of bandits, the local military police are making every effort to suppress them. Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government notified all embassies to inform all foreign nationals to take note, in order to avoid unexpected dangers. After receiving the above notice yesterday, the Japanese Embassy Office has already instructed Japanese nationals to be informed.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang's Speech After Returning to China</h3>
<p>Report on Impressions of Visiting Japan</p>
<p>Exposing Old Habits of National Arts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality National Arts Association, for the return of Zhang Zhijiang, Director of the Central National Arts Institute, convened national arts organizations and held a welcoming meeting at the YMCA on the 18th. At 3:00 PM that day, various organizations and Director Zhang arrived successively. The meeting started on time, chaired by Weng Guoxun, with Jiang Xiaxia as the recorder. After the chairman announced the opening remarks, Director Zhang stood up first and said, "Today, I am deeply honored that my comrades have convened a meeting to welcome me back from Japan. I believe that this is an opportunity for me to have a gathering with my comrades and report to you my observations from this trip to Japan." His attitude was amiable and his words were sincere. After the announcement, he gave a speech, saying, "I can report to you three things about my trip to Japan. The first is Japanese culture and society, the second is international sports, and the third is national arts itself. First, Japan and our country are of the same race and culture. The situation in Japan is no different from that of Chinese people, except for the clothes, which have round collars and square sleeves. This is the ancient costume of our country. In our ancient country, it can only be seen in books and paintings. I did not expect that the three islands of Japan would remain the same. As for its culture, it vigorously advocates the teachings of Confucius and makes every effort to promote morality. From top to bottom, the slogans on the walls and the leaflets along the way are visible everywhere. This is very different from the phenomenon of abolishing or respecting Confucius in our country. I once saw an image of Boyi and Shuqi, solemnly hung on the wall with a biography beside it for reference. This is enough to see a glimpse of its culture. Japanese diplomats and military officials certainly do not hesitate to say that invading China is a strategy, but I have met with several elders in the Yuanlaoyuan, all over seventy or eighty years old, with white beards and hair, who have a sincere and pro-Chinese expression, and are also very concerned about the suffering of our people. Social undertakings pay attention to the lives of ordinary people, and employment agencies are established everywhere. Except for university graduates, who have difficulty finding things, ordinary people do not lose their jobs. Thinking about the lives of the people, such as simple accommodation, is only 20 to 50 cents a day, and public canteens are only 12 cents to 50 cents a day. There are 20 to 30 such places in Tokyo. As for the students, whether they are university students, they are all simple and self-respecting, wearing uniforms made of domestic coarse cloth, resembling Chinese laborers, and their sincere and hardworking attitude is overflowing on the outside. Chinese people must be alert to this. Regarding the various military supplies of the country, sea, land, and air, they do not borrow from others. They set up factories to build convenient transportation. No matter whether it is a train, tram, or bus, it is accessible in all directions, and the maximum waiting time for passengers is five minutes. Second, this international sports conference was the ninth. In general, China is a loser. In fact, it can be predicted, without divination. The Japanese people are united from top to bottom and their competitive spirit is fierce. The positive preparation of their forces can certainly make the Chinese people admire them and make them ashamed. This time, our country only has volleyball, which is barely satisfactory and ranked in a winning position. Secondly, football failed due to unfair judges. The rest is unspeakable, and the swimming event even failed to qualify for the preliminary test. Foreign boxing (that is, those wearing leather gloves) is a public fist in the world, but there is no one in China, and it was obtained by the Philippines. The technique of throwing the ball is the most agile in Japan. One throw and one catch is more ingenious and agile than the past Chinese gold, one release and one catch. In the Japanese track and field competition, elementary and middle school students all chase trams every morning to prepare for the competition. There are many racers running one thousand meters and ten thousand meters, but in our country, I am afraid that it is difficult to find one thousand meters. Under my observation this time, I felt very deeply, so I dare to tell the comrades here that there are three things that I have to pay attention to. Our country's national arts is like the basic money of a bank. It must be actively practiced and must not be left for a moment. For sports, no matter whether it is football, volleyball, throwing the ball, track and field, swimming, high jump, boxing, and other methods to deal with the environment, for the race to add light, it is really necessary to nourish the essence, take care of both, and practice together. Fortunately, the comrades of the national arts, and then practice the methods of sports, will be able to easily get started. In the future, they will be more powerful and have more hope of surpassing the other countries with no foundation in martial arts. Third, for the national arts itself, Japan has not yet established our country's national arts, but there is only the sumo wrestling gate, which was originally imported from our country in ancient times. Its method is clumsy and does not work. In modern times, it has been improved. Everyone is practicing judo, (that is, Chinese wrestling). The method of practice is barefoot, with cotton mats on the floor to avoid the filth of socks on the sandy ground of China. This time back to Beijing, the National Arts Institute should follow this. Lecture halls are set up everywhere, and they are full every day. The enthusiasm of the Japanese has become a habit. It is conceivable that the country is strong and the people are strong. The mystery of our country's national arts, or the virtual is the real, or the real is the virtual, the complicated changes are infinitely wonderful, but unfortunately there is a big disease, why, that is, the view of the portal, the struggle of the factions, with this end, if you can not break the elimination, I am afraid that there will never be a day to carry forward. Compared with the Japanese, the enthusiasm and openness of the teachers and the sincere requirements of the trainees are really a thousand miles a day. There is no evil wind of passing on sons but not daughters, nor is there any attached habit of mutual jealousy. From now on, I hope that all comrades will change it if they have it, and encourage it if they do not, and especially hope that those who practice martial arts must also practice Shaolin, and those who practice Shaolin must also practice Wudang, without being polite and without private opinions, otherwise there will be progress and no retreat. Finally, I said that I have been in the National Arts Institute for two years, limited by economic talent, I can not develop, and there are not many contributions to the country. I hope that the people of our country will nationalize the national arts and achieve the purpose of strengthening the species, strengthening the body, and defending the country and the people. I hope that all comrades will unite, actively work hard, and move forward. I and all comrades have the same aspirations and the same responsibility."</p>
<p>Gu Bohua, the representative of the Shanghai Special Municipality National Arts Institute, replied, "Today, I am very happy to have Director Zhang come to guide us and teach us sincerely. However, the director believes that the view of the portal and the struggle of the factions are a major drawback of national arts and a major obstacle. It is really a sensible and famous saying to see the crux. Bohua hopes that all comrades will earnestly reform and expand their horizons, taking the nation and art as the most important, and strive to move forward on the path of impartiality and selflessness. In the future, our country's national arts will surely be carried forward and have a new life, and I hope that Director Zhang will return to Beijing and mediate with the authorities to order the establishment of a mandatory subject in all schools, large and small, in various provinces, in order to popularize the people, as for the funding problem of the Shanghai National Arts Institute, only 300 yuan per month, and I hope that Director Zhang will try his best to find a way to develop it."</p>
<p>Director Zhang replied, "The National Arts Institute originally had a three-year teaching class, guns, knives, fists, and sticks, all of which must have a foundation before graduation. Later, due to economic and talent relations, it is no longer being done. Its first graduation has not been willing to leave the museum. The reason is that their learning is insufficient and they are afraid that it will be difficult to respond to the world. I also hope that all comrades who are teachers must teach enthusiastically, but no matter whether the teacher is teaching or practicing, morality and learning are equally important. Otherwise, it is not worth mentioning. When I was in Japan, I also set up a national arts research class with my comrades. Once promoted, it was very enthusiastic. As for the establishment of national arts as a compulsory subject in various schools, I once proposed it at the first educational conference, and the result was set as a free elective subject. It has been filed." At the end, Ling Ziguang, the representative of the National Arts Department of the Hebei Fellow Association, Liu Desheng, the representative of the Public Sports Field, and Zhang Qidong, the representative of the Chinese Sports Association, all made speeches, saying that national arts cannot be compared with sports on an equal footing. At the end, there were national arts performances, such as Tong Zhongyi, Tong Jiaxiang, Ding Baoyuan, Du Wanqing, Peng Tong, Zhang Wenfa, Jiujie Whip, Wang Fengtong, Liuhe Fist, Liu Desheng, Swordsmanship, Chuan Sheng, Xiaohaihua, and other twenty people. After the performance, the chairman, with the consent of Director Zhang, performed Taijiquan. The dragon roared and the tiger paced, and the audience applauded. When the meeting ended, it was already full of lights.</p>

<h3>Local Court Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Case of Burying Boy Alive</p>
<p>Hou Genbao Denies Everything</p>
<p>But Everyone at Home Knew</p>
<p>Lawyer Asks for Reduced Punishment</p>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>The case of Hou Genbao from Guanlong, Tanziwan, Zhabei, burying his cousin Guan Maoda alive was continued yesterday by Judge Deng. The official asked Hou Genbao, "Do you often go to Guan Liukun's house?" (Answer) "I go to his house to dig bamboo shoots, and I go home around 6:00 PM after eating." (Question) "What is Cai Di to you?" (Answer) "She is my cousin." (Question) "What about Mao Da?" (Answer) "My cousin." (Question) "Who wants Cai Di to marry you?" (Answer) "There is no such thing." (Question) "Did you go to work after eating on May 6th?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Who told you to murder Mao Da?" (Answer) "I am being framed." (Question) "Tell the truth, and the court may be lenient." (Answer) "He is my cousin, how could I do it?" (Question) "Why did you run away?" (Answer) "I went to look for Mao Da." (Question) "Did you see Mao Da that day?" (Answer) "I didn't see him. I worked with my maternal uncle." (Question) "When was Mao Da last seen on May 6th or the eighth?" (Answer) "I don't know." (Question) "When did your mother see Mao Da's body?" (Answer) "I went out to look for Mao Da on the ninth and came back. My mother had already gone to the bureau." (Question) "Did your mother tell you that Mao Da's body was found and then you ran away?" (Answer) "My mother didn't tell me. My maternal uncle came on the ninth and went with me to Jing'an Temple to look for him, and we also went to Wangjiazhai in Hanqiao but didn't see him. On the tenth, I went home around 8:00 AM, and the people at home said that my mother had gone to the bureau because my maternal uncle's son had died in my family's field, so I sent clothes to the bureau." (Question) "Now the Tanziwan Bureau says that this wooden mallet was found when you were arrested. Did you hit Mao Da with it?" (Answer) "There is no such thing in my house." (Question) "Your brother and others say that it was found in your house. When did you dig the pit?" (Answer) "I don't know." At this point, Guan Liukun's testimony was taken. "Hou Genbao is my nephew. He doesn't come very often. He came at 12:00 on the eighth and went out at 1:00. He came again at 3:00. Genbao took Mao Da out to catch field chickens, and later Genbao came home alone." (Question) "When did Hou Guan see the body in the field?" (Answer) "At 3:00 PM on the ninth." (Question) "Was Henbao there when the child's body was found?" (Answer) "Yes, he ran away after learning about it." (Question) "Who killed Mao Da?" (Answer) "Genbao killed him." (Question) "Who is a witness?" (Answer) "Everyone at home knows." (Question) "Is Cai Di back?" (Answer) "Not back." At this point, Hou Guan was asked when she saw Mao Da's body. (Answer) "I saw it at 3:00 on the ninth." (Question) "When did you tell your son?" (Answer) "Around 3:00." (Question) "Did your son run away after hearing this?" (Answer) "Yes, I told him to call his maternal uncle, but he left and never returned." At this point, Patrol Chief Shi Yamin testified that Genbao was arrested on Jiaotong Road at 11:00 PM on May 10th and did not surrender himself. On the 11th, he was taken to his house where the murder weapon, a wooden mallet, and a shovel for digging the hole were found. Later, he confessed to the Fourth District. At this point, Guan Liukun's neighbor Qian Jianzhou testified that he was a worker and went out early and returned late, so he didn't know. Land Guardian Shu Ren testified that people in the area knew that Hou Genbao had committed the murder, but they were unwilling to testify because it was not their business. At this point, Hou Genbao was asked again, "You said in the bureau that Mao Da was not good and your cousin told you to kill him so you could get married, and that you dug the pit on the eighth and tricked your cousin there and hit him on the back of the head with a wooden mallet and pushed him down and buried him alive." (Answer) "This is a confession forced by torture." Then, Prosecutor Xu gave his opinion, saying that the circumstances of the defendant killing Mao Da were that he first dug a pit and then hit him with a wooden mallet, which was confessed clearly in the Fourth District. It can be seen that it was done by him. Why was the wooden mallet found in his house? This is conclusive proof. After his mother saw the body, he ran away. The defendant's premeditated murder has been proven. Please sentence him according to the law. At this point, designated defense lawyer Zhou Yu defended the defendant, saying that the defendant was sued by the prosecutor based on the facts, and the defendant could not deny it. However, the defendant confessed in the Fourth District and should be given a reduced sentence according to the law. The judge then announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled sentencing. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Attention to Public Bus Safety</h3>
<p>Ticket Conductor Fined for Not Following Regulations</p>
<p>On June 12th, a bus inspector from the Municipal Public Works Bureau found that the door of a Hubei South Public Bus was not closed and it was driven, and it was carrying too many passengers, exceeding the limit, which was a clear violation of the regulations. The ticket conductor of the No. 95 bus was instructed to pay attention in the future. Not only did the ticket conductor refuse to comply, but his attitude was stubborn and his words were disrespectful. According to the report of the Public Works Bureau, public buses must not be driven before closing the door, which has been repeatedly ordered to be obeyed. However, the above situation still occurred, which is very inappropriate. The company was ordered to suspend the ticket conductor for one month, and the driver of the No. 8 bus was driven without waiting for the door to be closed and had his license revoked for one month to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Merchant Marine School to Add Marine Engineering Department</h3>
<p>The original subjects of the Wusong Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Communications were navigation and marine engineering. Last year, when the school opened, it only recruited two classes of navigation students because the internship factory, which is most needed by marine engineering students, was not ready for a while. This summer vacation, the school has formulated a detailed plan for the construction of the factory and has already invited people to bid and is engaged in the construction of the factory buildings. The machines and boilers are made in Germany and have been ordered from abroad, and it is estimated that they will arrive in September or October. All the equipment will be completed and installed, so the addition of a marine engineering department and the enrollment procedures have also been submitted to the ministry and approved. Two classes of marine engineering, a total of 70 students, and one class of navigation, 40 students, and 10 transfer students in the first grade will be recruited. In addition to publishing in various newspapers in this port, there are many overseas Chinese students in Nanyang who have sent letters since last winter requesting pre-registration, and they are now coming in droves. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang are far away from their homeland and have never seen a Chinese ship leave the country, which has stimulated them deeply and their hopes are high.</p>
<h3>Summer Epidemic Hospital Set Up in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Sixth District Party Department of this city previously believed that the Zhabei area was vast and densely populated, and epidemic diseases were rampant in the summer. The original health facilities of the municipal authorities were not comprehensive. A special request was submitted to the Municipal Party Department to transfer to the Municipal Health Bureau to establish an epidemic hospital in Zhabei to benefit the civilians. The Health Bureau stated that the expenses for the 19th year had already been stipulated and could not be transferred, and requested instructions from the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government believed that the city had already carried out large-scale cholera vaccination, which would provide considerable protection against summer epidemic diseases. If another epidemic hospital were added, the financial resources of the municipal treasury would not be able to cope with it for a while. However, for the convenience of patients, there are three charitable organizations or private hospitals, Pushan, Pingmin, and Ansheng, in the Zhabei area. The Health Bureau can negotiate with them and temporarily designate them as concurrent epidemic hospitals so that civilians can receive nearby medical treatment. The Health Bureau was ordered to handle it. Subsequently, the Health Bureau sent a letter to negotiate with Pushan Hospital to convert it into a summer epidemic hospital. Pushan Hospital is located in the middle of Xinmin Road, Zhabei, and the management is relatively complete. From then on, civilians in Zhabei will have a more convenient hospital for diagnosis and treatment in the event of summer epidemics.</p>

<h3>Public Works Department Expands Legal Team</h3>
<p>Re-Hiring Two Lawyers</p>
<p>Relocating Office</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Special District Court, the legal affairs of the Public Works Department have become increasingly complex, and the number of lawyers has also increased. Therefore, the office of the team has been moved to No. 6 Hong Kong Road. The expanded premises will allow for greater flexibility. However, the authorities believe that the current six lawyers are still insufficient, and they need to recruit more legal talent to assist them. It is said that they have set their sights on Mr. Li Zhishan and Mr. Zhang Tianyin. They plan to hire them starting on the 1st of next month. Mr. Zhang and Mr. Li are both graduates of the Soochow Law School. Mr. Zhang holds a Master of Laws degree and was originally the head of the legal department of the British American Tobacco Company. Mr. Li served in the Lishi Society in the capital and is also a young revolutionary and lawyer. After July 1st, the number of lawyers sent by the Bureau to the Special District Court to handle cases, including both Chinese and Westerners, will be eight. Mr. Bolin from the United States will be the leader. The police department has specially assigned Western Detective Yao Ke to be stationed in the legal team to manage the handover of various cases and provide consultations to facilitate liaison, due to the complex matters handled by the department and the legal team.</p>

<p>According to the North China Daily News, the case of the American Wu Shihua and his wife fighting for custody of their adopted son was heard in court by the American judge yesterday. Because Mr. Wu left the adoption document in his residence in the United States and could not present it, the judge ordered a postponement of one week to inquire with the American court by telegram before making a decision. It is expected that if the reply from the American court can prove that the document was indeed filed and approved in the New York court, then Wu Shihua will be temporarily allowed to take back his adopted son, but he must remain in the area under the jurisdiction of the American Consular Court, waiting for the American court to examine his wife and send her deposition to China before determining who the child belongs to.

<p>Fiancée Dislikes His Profession</p>
<p>Divorce Suit Filed</p>
<p>Xia Weixian, a Suzhou native and actor at the Renji Road No. 35 Shanghai Film Company, is only 23 years old. When he was young, his parents arranged a marriage for him with a Zhang woman named Dezhen from the same hometown. The woman is 25 years old. Both had reached the age for marriage, but since Xia's parents passed away, his family's financial situation has been poor. He joined the film industry, but although he is a handsome young man, he has never been among the stars. Therefore, his monthly income is only 40 yuan, not enough to pay the betrothal gifts, and the woman's family demands extravagant gifts, so the wish to get married cannot be fulfilled. The woman also deliberately makes things difficult, saying that she was young and ignorant when the engagement was made, and she has not given her consent as an adult. She has now heard that her fiancé has no proper occupation. If she marries a poor scholar, they will inevitably face poverty. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit to dissolve the marriage contract. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou Daren of the Special District Court held a hearing. Ms. Zhang arrived in court in fashionable attire, stating her reasons for not wanting to marry Xia. Xia also arrived in court, expressing his unwillingness to dissolve the contract. Judge Zhou, referring to the plaintiff's complaint that the defendant has no proper occupation, asked the plaintiff what her basis was, since the defendant claimed to work in the film industry. Ms. Zhang then said that she opposed the defendant's current occupation, so it was as if he had no occupation. However, she vowed that she would never marry him. Her determination was firm. Judge Zhou then questioned the defendant, who also refused to say that he would agree to dissolve the contract. After the plaintiff's lawyer made a defense, the court ordered both parties to retire and wait for a scheduled verdict.</p>

<h3>Extortion Argument Becomes Criminal Case</h3>
<p>Accused of Illegal Arrest</p>
<p>Verdict: Not Guilty</p>
<p>Hongfeng Hardware Store at No. 267 Henan Road has recently suffered business losses, is heavily indebted, and is unable to continue operating. It has now declared liquidation. Renheng Money Exchange on Ningbo Road is also one of the store's creditors, owed several thousand yuan. On the evening of the 27th of last month, Qin Zunian, a clerk from the money exchange from Ningbo, went to Hongfeng. At that time, the store was not yet closed. Qin saw that the store had few goods in stock and feared that it would close down. Therefore, he asked Sun Shoubao, the store's shareholder and manager from Ningbo, for the money owed. Sun made an excuse to find the accountant in order to settle the account. From then on, he left and never returned. Sun's wife, Ms. Yu, lived in the store. Qin waited for a long time and did not see Sun return, so he questioned her harshly, leading to an argument. The patrol officer nearby feared that it would cause trouble and took them both to the General Patrol Police Station. The police chief inquired about the debt dispute and dismissed them. Later, Sun returned and, after being told by Ms. Yu about being taken to the police station, he thought of using the incident as an excuse and hired a lawyer to accuse Qin of illegal arrest in a criminal case. Yesterday afternoon, Sun Yuanzhi of the Special District Court held a hearing. According to Sun and Ms. Yu, they suffered from illness for many days after being released from the police station due to the fright. According to Sun Shoubao, he is a clerk of the store, not a shareholder or manager. It has now been declared liquidation and owes the money exchange 4,000 taels. Qin stated that he went to the store to collect the debt and had already filed a civil lawsuit, and there was no illegal arrest. Ye Fokang, a lawyer, debated with the plaintiff's lawyer until the end. Judge Sun declared Qin Zunian not guilty.</p>

<p>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union</p>
<h3>Laborers in the Machine Department Continue Go-Slow Strike</h3>
<p>The New Shanghai News reported that the laborers in the machine department of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company continued their go-slow strike yesterday. All the laborers entered the factory as usual at about 7:00 a.m., but unexpectedly, the factory suddenly expelled a small number of laborers from the factory and closed the iron gates, preventing all the laborers from entering the factory. This led to a transition from a go-slow strike to a strike. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Notice After the go-slow strike by all the laborers on the 18th, the factory posted a notice at night, stating that because the workers in the lathe room and other departments were unwilling to work on June 18th, the factory decided to close the lathe room and the factory gate. The notice said that the factory would reopen only after the workers notified the company that they were willing to resume work according to the current treatment method. The notice was dated June 19, 1930.</p>
<p>Union Report The Water and Electricity Workers' Union learned of the factory's refusal to allow laborers to enter the factory and its expulsion of laborers, and the closure of the iron gates. Fearing that it would incite the laborers and lead to a strike, it submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The petition stated that the union had previously submitted six conditions to the employer and that the bureau had scheduled a meeting of both parties on the 17th. However, the employer intentionally failed to attend, making mediation impossible. The union's laborers were shocked to hear of this and, in accordance with the resolution of the general meeting, unanimously went on a go-slow strike on the 18th in the hope of making the employer realize the situation. However, there was no response from morning till night. Today (the 19th), the laborers entered the factory as usual, but the employer locked the iron gates, preventing the laborers from working. In this situation, the employer intentionally oppressed the laborers, inciting a strike. The laborers had no choice but to leave the factory. As this matter concerns the overall situation, it is necessary to request an investigation and mediation to maintain the union's compliance.</p>
<p>Afternoon Meeting The union held a general meeting of all members at its headquarters in the afternoon. More than 700 laborers attended. Zhou Funong was sent by the Municipal Party Committee to provide guidance, and the Public Security Bureau also sent several police officers to maintain order. Xu A'mei, the chairman, reported on the factory's expulsion of the laborers and the closure of the iron gates. After discussion, the laborers decided to remain calm and continue the go-slow strike, stating that the strike was not initiated by the laborers themselves and that, if necessary, it was forced by the factory. Subsequently, a go-slow strike committee was established, with 27 members appointed to various positions, in order to urge the employer to realize the situation and resolve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Appeal to All Sectors The union issued an appeal to all sectors for assistance, stating that, we are unfortunate. On the 19th, we were oppressed by the employer, leading from a go-slow strike to a complete cessation of work by all the laborers. Because the cost of living is rising daily, and the price of gold is soaring, there is no decrease in the cost of rice and firewood. Therefore, we submitted only six conditions to the employer, which were based on law and reason, and did not make excessive demands. The application was approved by the Municipal Party Committee. Unexpectedly, the employer not only refused three times but also failed to attend the mediation meeting convened by the Municipal Party Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau on the 17th, showing that they had no sincerity in resolving the matter. Therefore, we convened a meeting and decided to unanimously go on a go-slow strike on the 18th in the hope of urging the employer to realize the situation. Standing under the scorching sun, sweating, we were very earnest in our demands. Anyone with a human heart would have pitied us. However, foreign capitalists are accustomed to oppressing and exploiting Chinese laborers, without any room for negotiation. At 7:00 a.m. today, our laborers went to the factory as usual, but the employer expelled a small number of laborers and locked the iron gates. We laborers wanted to work, but we were rejected. It can be said that our strike was entirely caused by the employer. Alas, it is heartbreaking. We are very aware that our strength is limited, but all our laborers, under the guidance of the Three Principles of the People, have identified our goals and are negotiating with the employer with a spirit of dauntlessness. We also hope that all sectors will provide more assistance. This is the ardent and tragic appeal of all our laborers.</p>

<h3>News from the Association of Families of May 30th Martyrs</h3>
<p>Injured Comrades...Register Quickly</p>
<p>The Association of Families of May 30th Martyrs had previously decided to continue processing for six months, until June 30th, because many families of the martyrs and injured comrades had not yet registered with the association to receive compensation. The reason for this was that they were either in other ports or had not yet been informed. In order to allow the families of the unregistered beneficiaries and the injured comrades to register and receive compensation within the time limit, after the continued processing began, families living in other ports or those who had been informed by relatives and friends went to the Family Association one after another to register and submit all the certificates of injury at the time of the disaster. The Family Association sent personnel to investigate and verify the facts, and after obtaining proper store guarantees, the compensation was paid in batches. As June 30th is approaching, the Association found that there were still a small number of injured comrades who had not registered. Therefore, the secretary, Zhou Zaisheng, and the staff member, Sun Guangfu, were sent to visit the residences of the injured comrades. However, after five years, the addresses of the injured comrades at the time of the injury have now been moved. Inquiries with the neighbors all said they did not know, so it was impossible to notify them. In some cases, the addresses of two or three injured comrades were not specified, making it even more difficult to notify them. The two representatives of the Family Association, Hu and Chen, regretted this very much. Unexpectedly, something unexpected happened. Yesterday, the families of injured comrades Zhou Renlian and Mei Zhonglin, and injured comrades Wang Ruping, Liu Shaoxian, and Li Yixun came to register. The two representatives of the Family Association, Hu and Chen, were very happy. They also learned that the Family Association had found that the hometown of the martyr Xu Luofeng was Songjiang. They had previously sent a letter to the Songjiang County Government ordering the district chiefs, township chiefs, and town chiefs to investigate, but had not received a reply. They will send another letter to the Songjiang County Government to urge the investigation. The injured comrades who have been found to be unregistered are only six people. If they do not register to receive compensation within the time limit, it is said that the case will be transferred to the board of directors for review.</p>
<h3>Final Extension for the Relocation of Coffins</h3>
<p>Until the end of August</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Public Security and Health Bureaus jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating that there are too many floating coffins in the city, which is detrimental to public safety, hygiene, and the appearance of the city. The bureaus had previously issued a notice to all coffin owners, limiting them to relocate all the coffins themselves before the end of June. If they failed to do so, charitable organizations would bury them on their behalf. It has recently been found that, in addition to the north and south districts, where the Pushan Villa and other charitable organizations have buried 549 coffins and have now been cleared, there are still a large number of floating coffins in the other city districts that have not been relocated. In order to show consideration for coffin owners from other places and those who live far away, the bureaus are now setting another deadline of the end of August for all the floating coffins in the city to be relocated. If they still fail to comply after the deadline, charitable organizations will bury them on the spot on their behalf, and there will be no further extensions. This notice is hereby issued so that all coffin owners of floating coffins will be informed and will not make a mistake.</p>

<h3>Curiosities from the Entrance Exam · Yu Jianhua</h3>
<p>The Chinese examination system has a long history. The "Book of Documents" says, "Evaluate merit every three years, and after three evaluations, promote or demote based on the obvious and the obscure." The "Rituals of Inspecting Schools" states, "Inspecting schools means examining scholars' mastery of their studies." This indicates that examinations existed as early as the Three Dynasties. Later, the Tang Dynasty used subjects to select scholars, the Song Dynasty used paste-and-patchwork essays, and the Ming and Qing Dynasties used eight-legged essays. The poison of the imperial examinations was deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Therefore, even though schools were established and the examination halls were abolished, the examination system still exists. After the May Fourth Movement, there was a movement to abolish examinations, but it soon faded away. The reason is that if schools have no examinations, not only is it impossible to assess academic performance, but both schools and students feel lax and lack a spirit of enterprise. It is human nature to love ease and hate work. Few people can be diligent in their studies without supervision. Moreover, young and ignorant students spend their days playing games. This time, the Special Municipality Education Bureau resolutely held a joint junior high school graduation examination. As a result, all the middle schools were in a flurry, digging a well only when thirsty and clutching at straws. Books such as "Questions and Answers on the Three Principles of the People," "Questions and Answers on Various Subjects," and "Encyclopedia of Common Knowledge: Must-Read for Exams" sold three times as well. The graduates changed their cheerful expressions to frowning and wincing, and they were glued to their books, even taking special night classes in order to rank at the top. The sixteenth was the first day of the joint examination. The students' association of Zhabei was at the Guangzhao Middle School on Yokohama Bridge. Each school was led by one or two teachers. I also went with Mr. Sun Xiangzhong to send twenty-eight female students. We arrived at eight o'clock, and the place was already bustling with voices. There were a total of seventeen examination halls on three floors. There were more than six hundred students, sitting together regardless of gender, with more boys than girls. Each room had only two or three girls out of ten. At eight-thirty, the Party Principles test was administered, consisting of thirty multiple-choice questions. It was quite easy, so in less than half an hour, people were handing in their papers. The papers were not signed, but were instead identified by number. At ten-thirty, lunch was served. I even brought a ping-pong paddle and played during the break, showing how relaxed I was. In the afternoon, the Chinese language test was administered, with the topic being "A Self-Description of School Life." It was still easy. However, there were five multiple-choice questions, which were somewhat outdated and not something that today's junior high school students, who are engaged in vernacular literature, would be able to fully understand. As a result, there were many mistakes. (1) What are the four tones? (2) What books are specifically referred to as the Four Sub-Texts? (3) Who wrote the "Book of Han" and the "Records of the Grand Historian"? (4) Was "Dream of the Red Chamber" written by Han Yu? (5) Who are specifically referred to as the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties? Students only knew the Four Books but not the Four Sub-Texts, so they dared not write "The Great Learning," "The Doctrine of the Mean," "Analects of Confucius," and "Mencius," and instead wrote "Laozi," "Zhuangzi," "Mozi," and "Xunzi." Many wrote that Ban Chao wrote the "Book of Han," while some wrote that Confucius or Sima Guang wrote the "Records of the Grand Historian." Many knew that Cao Xueqin wrote "Dream of the Red Chamber," but many also did not know. Therefore, clever students simply answered that it was not Han Yu. One female student did not know for sure, so she wrote "yes" and "no" on two slips of paper and drew one. She got "no" and wrote it down. After a student had already answered "no," she thought she might be wrong, so she crossed out the "no" character. When she came out of the examination hall and asked others, she regretted it and cried. Not many knew the names of the Eight Great Prose Masters of the Tang and Song Dynasties. Therefore, not only did the average students feel great difficulty, but the proctors also wrung their wrists in despair.</p>
<h3>A Record of Visiting Ms. Guan's Personal Painting Exhibition · Meng Xu</h3>
<p>The establishment of art exhibitions is not an innovation, but this year's scene is depressed and lifeless, which makes people worry about the extinction of the domestic art world. If Copper Mountain does not collapse, how can the Los Bell respond? Then, the personal oil painting exhibition of Ms. Guan Zilan must not be held? Ms. Guan is from Guangdong, with a full face and thick hair. She is neither thin nor plump. Her demeanor is generous and has the style of a lady from a great family. When interacting with people, she is like her paintings, and one forgets that she is a woman. A certain Japanese artist likened her to a peony flower, which is quite insightful. Ms. Guan is good at Western painting, and she has been famous for a long time. She first graduated from China Art University, where she was an indoor disciple of the painter Ding Yanyong. After graduating, she went east to Japan and worked hard to study, and her art became more and more advanced. However, she is based on her mentor's teachings, so she has completely obtained the essence of Mr. Ding. Moreover, her painting style, brushstrokes, and color tones are also very similar to Ding's works. Therefore, when Ms. Guan's works were exhibited at the Jiande Society a few years ago, jealous people slandered her and said, "These are Ding's works. Why do you call them Guan's? Guan doesn't know how to paint." The words were conclusive, as if holding evidence. I heard it and glanced at them. The person was ashamed and went away in a hurry. Later, when I saw him again, or talked about the sons of the Western painting world, he dared not slander Guan again. However, he could not help but sneer at her. Fame brings slander, the ancients did not deceive me. Today, Ms. Guan Zilan opened her personal oil painting exhibition on the eighth floor of Hua'an. She presented more than fifty works, occupying two rooms. I drove there on Sunday morning. The fine rain was like silk, and a cool feeling attacked my sleeves. After arriving, I took the elevator up, signed my name, and entered the room. I saw Ms. Guan and the famous painter Mr. Chen Baoyi and his wife going back and forth, greeting the guests. They were very cordial and sincere. After entering the room, I looked up and watched, searching by name, browsing through each one, my eyes were bright and my heart was full of admiration. What came out of my mouth was praise. At noon, several friends also came together to appreciate the paintings. We peeked at the whole picture and still did not want to leave. Walking back and forth, I felt more and more like a poor child entering a treasure house for the first time, and I could not keep up with everything. I said to my friend, "Looking at each point, it is far beyond the previous work. From this, we can know that her hard work has been deep, and she is using her bold brushstrokes and her extraordinary talent to extract the momentary emotions of the object with the simple and gorgeous colors. The brushstrokes are powerful, without the feminine softness and charm. She is the number one female writer." My friend said, "Yes. Her unique personality is fully expressed in her decisive and straightforwardness. It's only Ms. Guan alone. As for the composition and coloring of the sketch, there is a special style, which is enough to make people see Guan's Guan." After speaking, we left the house together. Rain and wind beat against our faces. I wrote this to record the feast for my eyes after returning home.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Strong Wind at West Lake · Lian Weng</h3>
<p>Hangzhou's West Lake is originally a place to escape the summer heat. Recently, the weather has gradually warmed up. The willows are swaying gently, and people are calling for ferries. Those who leisurely float in the middle of the lake must return at dusk. Some couples even row their boats on the moonlit lake. It is truly a delightful experience. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 PM on the 7th of this month, a sudden strong wind arose, with flying sand and stones. Many of the umbrellas held by pedestrians on the lake embankment were blown into the center of the lake. And the cruise ships suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>A cruise ship is also called a "melon skin boat." The old style has no awning and is extremely simple, only for its speed. Recently, the boats are painted blue and white, with copper railings around the sides, seats in the middle, and cloth awnings above. They come and go in an orderly fashion, like weaving on a loom. When the wind started to move slightly, the boatmen had already anticipated that it would be strong. They quickly put away the awnings and rowed, intending to dock on the shore or moor at the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon or the Lake Heart Pavilion. However, before they had gone a few steps, the wind stirred the boat sideways, and the waves splashed. The tourists turned pale with shock. Some shouted for help, and some boats carried only beautiful women, who even began to sob. The boatmen could only try their best to move forward, hoping to reach the shore.</p>
<p>Before long, the sky was dark. The whole lake seemed like ink, and the wind still had not stopped. Some temporarily docked at the Yue Tomb, and some temporarily docked at the Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake. Finally, all the boats reached the pier in the West Garden. All the men and women, both tourists, were soaked and walked slowly. The boatmen still grumbled and demanded wine money, while the rickshaw pullers were even more fortunate to have their business tripled. Fortunately, the boatmen were rich in experience, so they did not suffer any capsizing, but they could not avoid being frightened.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Overseas</p>
<h3>A Letter Regarding the Criticism of Mei Lanfang (Part 1) · Zhi</h3>
<p>Mei Lanfang's trip to the United States was a success, which was universally praised. This was no easy feat. However, recently, some people have criticized the honorary doctorate awarded by an American university. I recently saw Mr. Zhao's letter to Mr. Tao Fen, which refuted this argument. Tao Fen had an original article, which was published in "Life," and I am reprinting it. The following is a transcript of the reply letter, which also shows that those who like to make high-sounding arguments can certainly justify themselves. The reply letter said (omitted above): "Regarding the praise and criticism of Mei, I initially said little, because it would be a waste of words to speak to those who are not worth talking to. Only before this, when Mr. Zhang Qiutong was in charge of 'Jia Yin,' there was a theory of the four dimensions. Because Qiutong is a contemporary master, he should not make frivolous remarks. I sent a letter to argue with him, as detailed in the 'Jia Yin' weekly. Now, you are using scholars to host the forum, and it is also the best of the magazines. I am really afraid that the influence will be great, so I have to offend you and present my views. Your theory first quoted 'contributing Chinese drama to the American public to increase their knowledge,' and asked what exactly this means. Mei's trip was aimed at allowing foreigners to learn about Chinese drama and art. At the same time, he also wanted to learn from others and encourage himself. He brought more than 20 companions and more than 100 pieces of luggage. He crossed the sea in a large ship, which was an unprecedented feat. His ambition is commendable and does not need to be praised too much. The United States is a newly established country, and most people have little contact with everything Eastern. For Chinese drama, apart from the fake statues on Broadway and the Cantonese opera in Chinatown (although it has its own strengths, it is not enough to represent the entirety of Chinese opera), everything is unknown. Now, they can see this elegant and luxurious drama, adding a touch of performance to the cheeks. Even if they don't understand it, how can it not be clearly increasing their knowledge? It is like a country boy from the mountains who, one day, goes to the seaside and sees the shining of electric lights and the rushing of trains. He does not need to study the scientific reasons for the invention, but he has to say that it increases his knowledge. This principle is very clear. You should be able to understand what I mean. You quoted the Western newspaper's comments, using the phrase that 'Shen Bao' has always been known for its praise of Mei. I have been wandering around Wangping Street for nearly ten years, and I know that newspaper records should be comprehensive. Politics and academics should be combined. As for those who cultivate national character and study the arts, they are even more celebrated. 'Shen Bao' reported on all kinds of news in great detail. How could it simplify the Mei affair? As for its detailed records during its stay in Shanghai, it is because Mei's arrival was indeed universally recognized by the society. His gestures and gatherings were something that many people wanted to know. Even company banquets and spring and autumn excursions in society news are still eligible for selection, let alone Mei's affairs. Moreover, it was not just one newspaper or one country that reported on it. If you could hear the newspapers in the United States and Japan, even if the train stopped briefly at a small station, there would be photos and bold characters. You should be even more surprised by the claim that 'Shen Bao' is responsible. 'Shen Bao' is only one-three thousandth of a spoon. The Western newspaper's comments quoted his words 'abandoning night palace life and worshiping oriental art,' which took the meaning out of context and clearly had ulterior motives. However, history says that Zhou Chushi was violent, but suddenly he killed the dragon and shot the tiger to complete his studies. Zeng Wenzheng, also known as Disheng, examined all his past mistakes to complete his achievements. So, the so-called abandoning the night palace and worshiping art should not be compared. Do you want to force the words to compare oriental art with night palace life and conclude that it is a humble theory? Then the wording is too far-fetched and incomprehensible. I hope you will use this as an explanation and consider it."</p>
<p>English Banknotes: The banknotes issued by the Bank of England are manufactured with extreme secrecy. The raw material paper is produced by a certain manufacturer in Leverstoke, Hampshire, and has not changed for more than 200 years. It selects a special kind of cloth thread, which is refined into paper. The process is completely manual, without the aid of machinery. Finally, it is washed in clear spring water. The paper is clean, smooth, and uniform. It is only used for printing banknotes and not for other purposes. The ingredients and formulation of the ink for printing banknotes are known to only six people in the whole of England. The main compound in the ink is charcoal. The charcoal is not ordinary charcoal, but is taken from the grape trees of Lannisi. The smoke after burning is collected when it is dry, so the purity of the quality is unmatched by ordinary charcoal sold on the market. Generally, each banknote costs one penny. The average period of circulation in society is about two and a half months. The Bank of England prints about 60,000 banknotes every day. And every year, after the old banknotes are redeemed, as many as 20 million are burned.</p>
<p>Desert Fish: Recently, some small fish were suddenly discovered in the Sahara Desert in North Africa. They have been collected by travelers and sent to the American Museum of Natural History for display. These small fish live in the pools of water in the lower layers of the desert. Some suspect that they are special aquatic species. In fact, this is not the case. Most of them are ordinary and common species, such as ribbon fish and bass. They can be found in the desert. After this exhibition, viewers discussed a lot and were surprised by the strange event. They said that the desert is desolate, so where did the fish come from? According to ideal speculation, it is the fish eggs in the freshwater river that stick to aquatic plants and mud, and are carried by birds, and then breed in the sand bottom pools. It may be true. But it has not been proven yet.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (216) · Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 12: Parting Farewell, Touching Flowers to Capture a Charming Image, Garden Party, Tea Fight to See Beautiful Posture</p>
<p>The waiter went to fetch ten cigarettes and placed them on a saucer. Zuo Shichen lit one and took a puff. The first few puffs seemed interesting. Later, he gradually felt a spicy taste. After a few more puffs, the spicy taste was mixed with a astringent taste. He thought of the experiences of life, like smoking cigarettes. If one is not deeply involved in the world, it is like the taste of the first puff of a cigarette. Then, one gradually feels the spiciness of the world. If one is unlucky in life and encounters blows everywhere, and people treat you harshly, how can you not frown and taste this spiciness? When the path of life becomes difficult and impassable everywhere, one reaches the astringent state. Then, the process of spiciness and astringency becomes clear everywhere, just like an old smoker who finds it profound and flavorful. Gradually, one is anesthetized by it. Therefore, he only smoked half a cigarette, and put the remaining half on a white porcelain match holder. The bottom half of the cigarette was left to burn and destroy itself. In fact, it was not yet eight o'clock. He was waiting anxiously, and he was alone here. If there were two people talking and chatting, he would not feel bored. He regretted not bringing a book to read. At that time, the restaurant was busy with customers. Many waiters saw that there was nothing to do here, so they ran outside. He scribbled with the small, broom-like pen on the back of a fragrant treat ticket. It turns out that people often have that kind of habit. When they go to a place and see a pen and paper, they will unconsciously scribble. It seems that if they don't scribble, their fingers will itch. Zuo Shichen was waiting for Ruiyun to come, so he wrote the two characters "Ruiyun" in large and small, neat and sloppy, many times on the back of the treat ticket. Then, eight o'clock passed. It was eight o'five. It was eight-ten. It was fifteen. She still hadn't come. It wasn't until about eight-thirty that Ruiyun and Ajin finally arrived slowly. Ajin first said in an apologetic voice, "Second Young Master, I'm sorry. I've kept you waiting for so long." Zuo Shichen said with a complaining tone, "I arrived here before seven o'clock. Didn't you say on the phone that you would definitely be here by eight o'clock at the latest? Look at what time it is now." Ajin said, "Oh, I'm really sorry. Originally, we drove past Yizhixiang several times before eight o'clock. I even said to Ayin, 'Second Young Master is probably already here.' She said, 'There are still a few times to sing. Let's just finish them and then go to Yizhixiang. In the future, if there are any more singing engagements, let Fengyun go. Tell them not to come again for business.' Then, wouldn't we be able to have a comfortable meal?'" It is probably true that waiting makes one anxious. But when the person arrives, the previous anxiety is also explained. Moreover, Ajin's explanation was even more comforting. Otherwise, those turtle sons outside would be nagging and nagging, which is so annoying.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Like Drunk, Like Mad</h3>
<p>Sudden highs and lows throughout the day with fifteen taels of fluctuation. Yesterday's gold market was extremely volatile, chaotic, and unstable, like a violent storm surge, with unstoppable momentum. People were in a daze, as if lost in a fog. In an instant, there were fluctuations of five or six taels, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Throughout the day, there were fluctuations of as much as fifteen taels, with no clear pattern. In the morning session, there were fluctuations of around ten taels, and new records were constantly being set. The highest peak of 606 taels was reached. This was because the silver market fell again, and foreign exchange rates narrowed by one level. The domestic market only saw erratic ups and downs, and the trend seemed to be loosening. Trading in chits by various firms was still active. Firms such as Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, and Tai Xing all bought in, while Shun Li, Wan Xing, and Fu Chang all sold out. Zhi Feng Yong and Da De Cheng alternately bought and sold. By noon, sellers were very active, and various exchange rates also showed weakness. The 600-tael mark had already been broken, and the subsequent market waves felt even more turbulent, with differences of more than ten taels. Exchange rates sometimes varied widely. In the market, Yuan Xing Yong, Fu Yu, Wan Xing, Shun Li, and others all actively pursued purchases, while Tian Yu Yong, Tai Xing, and Fu Chang sold out. Prices initially stabilized, but then suddenly fell to a low of 591 taels. Afterwards, all parties competed to buy, and in an instant, it seemed as if the sun was rising high in the sky, having jumped out of the 600-tael mark. Finally, it fell again, plummeting seven or eight taels, like being drunk or mad, making it very difficult to predict. Under the influence of the atmosphere, the evening market was above 595 taels.</p>
<h3>New Peak of 606 Taels Discovered in Gross Market. Sterling Silver Shrinks by One-Eighth, Silver Price Also Drops by One-Eighth.</h3>

Then, due to purchases such as hedging, and the tightening of foreign exchange rates, the recent interbank sterling-gold rate was 5 pence 875. Afterwards, the same price could be done in August.

However, there were occasional ups and downs of one or two taels. At 11 o'clock, it was 605 taels 5 mace. Soon after, Yuan Mao Yong, Yu Da, Yong Kang, and others sold off one after another, and the market looked like it was about to collapse. In half an hour, it plummeted seven or eight taels.

Sumitomo bought near-term Dalian at 1 tael 3 mace 2 fen 75. In an instant, it plummeted more than 5 taels. At around 2:30, it finally fell to 91 taels. Before long, it recovered 4 or 5 taels. After 3:30, it was particularly firm, as Yuan Cheng Yong and the Dalian gang bought in. Foreign exchange rates were also stable. Recently, sterling Shanghai and You Li did interbank trades at 6 pence 125. Therefore, the market atmosphere suddenly became sharp. At around 4 o'clock, it reached 602 taels 89 qian.

Anda and the British slightly sold off and also traded more than 100,000 pounds. Chinese merchants also sold more than 100,000 US dollars, and Korean and HSBC took it in.

<h3>Foreign Copper Coins Break the 2-Fen Mark.</h3>
<p>Sudden Increase of 2 Li… Copper Coins Released at 4,000 Wen.</p>
<p>Market Overview. This week, there were only four days, and the difference in the rise and fall of foreign copper coins was very large. The price of copper coins has surged even more in the past two days. The price of foreign copper coins was only 715 last Thursday, but yesterday (Thursday) it actually reached 7215. The difference between the high and low prices was as much as 6 and a half li. Furthermore, the average daily amount of foreign currency purchases and sales is 3 million. Therefore, the depreciation of the market price is considerable. Even without the manipulation of speculators, the horror of the violent storm is quite alarming.</p>
<p>Price of Copper Coins (Foreign Copper Coins). The sentiment was extraordinarily strong in the morning market. The public scrambled to buy, and the price of foreign copper coins suddenly rose by more than 1 li. The closing price was 7 qian 2 fen 1 li, an increase of 1 and a half li compared to the previous morning, actually breaking the 2-fen mark. The afternoon market continued to be enthusiastic, rising another half a li to 7 qian 2 fen 1 and a half li, a total increase of 2 li in one day, which cannot be said to be an extraordinary change. (Silver Copper Coins) The situation was stable, but slightly sluggish. The early morning price was 1 qian 1 fen, and the afternoon price was only 8 fen. There was plenty of headlining, and not only was there no added water, but no one even asked about white headlines.</p>
<p>Market Conditions for Auxiliary Coins. Since the last few days and the day before yesterday, the small silver coins of Jiangnan have undergone large ups and downs, and the market is confused and unstable. Yesterday, they rebounded by four or five li, with the early morning price being 6 qian 4 fen and the afternoon price being 6 qian 4 fen 1 li. It is said that this was caused by foreign firms making transactions, with 6,000 jiao in the early morning and 8,000 jiao in the afternoon. The market atmosphere was characterized by limited supply and high demand, with a bullish outlook. The small silver coins of Guangdong were as stagnant as ever, with the early morning price being 5 qian 9 fen 9 li and the afternoon price being 5 qian 9 fen 8 li. There were 225,000 jiao made in the early morning and 140,000 jiao made in the afternoon. The copper coins suddenly released 4,000 wen, having already exceeded the 400,000 wen mark, reaching 402,000 wen.</p>

<h3>Foreign Sales of Foreign Funds Unusually Smooth.</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Arrive on the Market… Loading Amount Over 4 Million.</p>
<p>At the end of last week, the foreign funds market was quiet, and the atmosphere was much worse. In the last two or three days, there was a sudden large amount of usage, and the market soared unusually, with a difference of almost half a cent. There are three reasons for this surge: (1) Summer crops are entering the market, and miscellaneous grain merchants such as wheat and beans are purchasing them, especially flour manufacturers, whose purchasing power is strong and who require a lot of funds. Yesterday, another 1.7 to 1.8 million in miscellaneous grains were loaded from the north, and wheat funds were purchased from the interior, estimated to be around 2 million, and another 600,000 was loaded from Shantou and Xiamen. (2) Currently, due to the poor market situation, various banks issuing banknotes are unable to fully prepare at their internal exchange agencies, and they are being cautious, not daring to issue banknotes indiscriminately. Therefore, the funds for this wheat purchase all need to be in cash. (3) Banks, seeing that the current cash sales are very smooth, are worried that even if their cash reserves are abundant, such a large amount of dredging will soon deplete them. For self-protection, they are preparing banknote reserves, not only refusing to release them but also absorbing as much as possible. The cash chips in the market are suddenly stretched, and the price of foreign copper coins is rising steadily.</p>

<h3>Bond Prices Suddenly Turn Bullish at Evening Closing.</h3>
<p>Customs Duty and Troop Reduction Continue to Fall Sharply.</p>
<p>Others Are Mixed with Active Transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot trading of public bonds was still rare, while futures trading remained active. The overall environment of the bond market was quite chaotic, with large inflows and outflows in the market, and prices fluctuated greatly. The morning opening continued the previous day's trend, and the market was increasingly weak. Later, prices fell step by step. The noon opening was the lowest point, with Customs Duty, Troop Reduction, and Troop Cuts all plummeting by around two or three yuan. However, in the closing session, buying suddenly increased, and prices soared. As a result, compared to the previous day, only Customs Duty and Troop Reduction futures for this month continued to fall by about one yuan. Other declines were very small, and Troop Cut futures even saw a slight rebound. The total spot trading for the day was only 5,500 yuan, while futures trading was over 6.3 million in the morning session and over 7.8 million in the afternoon, totaling over 14.1 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Sales Terribly Sluggish.</h3>
<p>Standards Weak and Difficult to Revive.</p>
<p>Actual sales of cotton yarn are extremely sluggish. All guilds lack enthusiasm. The world cotton yarn market is chaotic, and morale is weakening. Recently, several major players in the market have sold off, further depressing the market. However, some manufacturers' long positions have not sold off. The yarn market is affected by the poor environment, and it is feared that it will be difficult to turn around for a while.</p>
<p>Far-Month Yarn Continues to Fall by Five or Six Qian. At the opening of the pre-session, the price rose by seven or eight qian due to the slight rise in American cotton and the rise in gold prices, and scattered buyers bought in. In the second and third sessions, morale suddenly weakened, and each month fell by six or seven qian. As a result, each month rose by one or two qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual sales were bleak, with only 300 bales of business for the whole day. Furthermore, raw cotton loosened, morale became more and more empty, and each fell one, four, five, six, and eight qian. There were no large inflows or outflows in the market. The total transactions for the day were 14,950 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Pre-Session Closing Prices, Rise/Fall, Inventory Number, September 1578 Decrease 5 24,350</p>
<p>June 1546 Decrease 2 18,620 October 1582 7 25,350</p>
<p>July 1557 2 21,800 November 158 6 16,600</p>
<p>August 1568 2 27,750</p>
<p>Only 300 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded. Sales of spot yarn are quite light. It is found that only 300 bales were purchased by various guilds throughout the day. 800 bales entered the same industry. The market is stable and weak. Among the customer guilds, the inland guild bought the most, accounting for 140 bales. In addition, Guangdong entered 35 bales, Hankou entered 30 bales, Xiamen entered 35 bales, Niuzhuang entered 50 bales, and Shantou entered 10 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Lacks Spirit.</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat and weak, with most people expecting prices to fall. With US cotton consumption decreasing, there are concerns that the future may see a downward trend. Japanese merchants purchased Indian cotton in India and sold Chen cotton in the standard market for seven or eight months. Therefore, people's minds were shaken by it, and the situation became more and more sluggish. However, the Hankou guild seized the opportunity to go short. The future of the cotton market still has changes. The exchange rate remains strong.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Situation Weak. The Hankou standard market opened, and although American cotton was stable, sellers continued to increase their bids, and there was a lack of buyers. Each rose five cents to one qian. In the afternoon, it plummeted one qian five cents to two qian. Buyers were the Jinzi guild, Shen Chang 2,600 dan, Da Feng 1,700 dan, Tian Chang 1,900 dan, and Li Chang 2,500 dan. Sellers were Da Chang Cheng 1,200 dan, Yi Cheng Chang 1,700 dan, Chang Feng 1,000 dan, and De Ji 1,800 dan. The total transactions for the day were 38,500 dan. The closing prices of the Hankou standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>July 36.30 10 67,900 November 36.15 10 63,300</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Actions Are Sluggish. The spot cotton business is still flat. Manufacturers' attitudes are sluggish. The source is estimated to be 420 bales of Tonghua and 500 bales of Yaohua.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 37.25 Yong'an Factory Entered 100 Pieces Sent to Factory</p>

<h3>Tong Cotton Field Reduced by About 10%.</h3>
<p>New Cotton Growth Is Quite Good.</p>
<p>According to those who came from Nantong, the local cotton price situation is as follows: The new cotton field this year has been reduced because rice prices are expensive, there is more rain, and rice cultivation has been changed. According to personal observation, it is about 10% less than last year. The growth of new cotton is quite good due to the harmony of rain.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn Turns Firmer and More Stable.</h3>
<p>American Cotton Offsets Shorts and Rises. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good Liverpool news, then tired due to Wall Street's poor morale, and finally rebounded again due to short covering. Futures rose 12 to 15 pounds, spot rose 15 pounds. British cotton futures rose and fell by one point, spot rose five points. Egyptian cotton spot rose twenty-five points. The Indian cotton market was stagnant, and prices remained unchanged. The original telegram is recorded on the left (18th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grains, Foreign Rice Opened Over 20,000 Bags.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was very interested in stomach-clearing, opening more than 20,000 bags. Local and Liangbang merchants were particularly greedy, and scalpers also took the opportunity to buy, so the price rose again by two or three jiao. No. 1 Saigon reached as high as 17 yuan 4 jiao, No. 2 also reached 16 yuan 6 jiao, small size 16 yuan 2 jiao 8 fen, large size 15 yuan 7 jiao half. Ke Gai rice was 17 half, and Min Dang was 17 yuan. The most transactions were for large and small sizes, each opening 6,000 to 7,000 bags, and the other sizes ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 or 600 bags.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Rose and Fell.</h3>
<p>Flour. Yesterday, the flour market saw near- and far-month prices rise one after another. June rose to 2 taels 6 qian 3 fen, November rose to 2 taels 6 qian 175, and other months rose to 2 taels 6 qian or more. The buying sentiment was very good, and morale was bullish. However, after the rise, outsiders interfered. The bulls first returned their positions, and the shorts took the opportunity to add to their positions, so each month fell back slightly. Before the closing, the factories stopped shipping, and some customer guilds actually withdrew spot flour, so the market stabilized slightly. As a result, June fell small 25, July fell big 75, August fell big 5 li, September fell big 25, October remained unchanged, and November fell small 5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat. Yesterday, wheat futures rose after the market opened. Due to the weather after the rain, morale was bullish. Due to the rice market rising steadily, the buyers were greatly assisted, and they were very aggressive. June rose immediately by 5 fen, July rose big 8 fen, August rose big 7 fen, and far-month contracts rose big 6 or 7 fen. In the afternoon, due to the flour market falling small, morale was slightly low. At the closing, June fell small 2 fen, July and August fell big 4 fen, September and October fell big 3 fen, and November fell big 5 fen. Spot wheat opened with 2,000 old wheat bags of Qingjiang and Xuzhou, priced at 4 taels 4 qian. New wheat Taizhou wheat was 5 taels 02 fen, Shaoxing Kunshan was 5 taels 056 fen, Shuangfeng was 5 taels 089 fen, Shashi was 5 taels 1 qian 7 fen, and others ranged from 4 taels 9 qian half to 4 taels 8 qian, totaling more than 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shaoxing New Summer Cocoon Harvest Still Deficient.</h3>
<p>Shaoxing, the former prefecture of Yuyao and other counties, this year's spring cocoon harvest was deficient. The class generally supplemented with summer silkworms. However, the weather was bad. At first, development was delayed due to the cold, and then there were strong winds and hail. Finally, the silkworms suffered damage due to thunderstorms and heat. Many were lost in the big sleep, and most died. Now, new cocoons are successively coming down, and it is estimated that the cocoon production has only three or four years of age. Silkworm households are disappointed.</p>
<h3>Gaozhuang Fine Eyebrows Continue to Sell Well in Europe.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wuyuan North Township and core-drawn fine eyebrows, British and French manufacturers were very interested. Needle eyebrows, beautiful eyebrows and other items, also had a slightly open path. The city's total turnover was 1,118 boxes, and the top price for fine eyebrows was 185 taels. Market prices did not rise or fall. Qimen black tea saw a reduction in transactions, and selling prices were also lower by two or three taels.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Tea Market Suddenly Revives</h3>
<p>After tea merchants and large firms collected tea from the gardens of Wuyuan, the new tea of Wuyi was sold off eight or nine tenths of the southwest road's goods. As for the large quantities of estate tea from the northeast roads, only those with suitable prices were sold in small amounts. For the past two weeks, almost no one had inquired about them. But the day before yesterday (the 10th), a telegram was suddenly received from the Shanghai branch, stating that the Association was arriving in Shanghai and that the tea market would revive. The tea merchants, regarding the arrival of the major buyers of Chinese tea and the support of large firms, were not worried about unsold goods. They紛紛 dispatched men to search for and buy new garden tea, and discussions about opening the scales for weighing tea have sprung up like a whirlwind. More than a dozen firms are competing to buy Longteng Wulong Zhuangzhou tea, and the market has suddenly revived.</p>
<p>New buds of Zi Tea are of good quality. The Zi Tea of Xiazhuang benefited from continuous dew in recent months, and the goods are excellent, with soft leaves and rich aroma. Initially, the tea merchants paid much attention to searching for and buying it, but due to unfavorable news from Shanghai, they all pressed down the price and bought little. The day before yesterday, when the new Zi Tea came out, the price offered by the firms was only 30 cents per catty. Because the mountain households found labor and rice prices too high, they stopped picking and producing. Since receiving news of the Association handling tea, the price of Zi Tea has been raised from 30 cents to 50 or 60 cents. With this doubled price, the mountain households are all willing to pick and sell. If the weather continues to be sunny in the coming days, the Zi Tea output should be abundant.</p>
<h3>Silk Fabrics, Yuan Fang and Feather, Rise by 1.6 Taels</h3>
<p>The price of both eastern and western piece goods has risen sharply, with an unprecedented aggressive trend. Although the peak season has not yet arrived, the exchange rate fluctuation has driven a flurry of purchases. Northern firms are aggressively buying Yuehua velvet and colored striped velvet, mainly because Osaka's pricing is soaring. The handle velvet, which was temporarily abundant, is being sold out as soon as it arrives, which is unexpected. Yesterday, the opening price for 3,000 pieces of Jilong and 100 pieces of Fuhua was 1.85 yuan, and black floral was also 1.85 yuan. Large handle was 1.9 yuan, but the price quoted by experts was another 1 cent higher. Zhigong呢 and Zhigong satin continued to rise by 1 to 0.5 cents. Western goods are becoming increasingly frenzied. Yesterday, Yuan Fang's asking price for Yuan feather silk rose by 1 to 1.6 taels, which is a rare phenomenon. Therefore, all goods are being driven by this rise. Yesterday, the Yuan velvet for the stage, which was not opened, was fairly priced at 97.5 cents. Baizi already requires 1.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods, Longkou Vermicelli, Rise Another Half Tael</h3>
<p>The market for Longkou vermicelli is low in stock, and recent sales in Guangdong and Fujian have been smooth, resulting in supply falling short of demand. The market price has continued to rise by half a tael, from 18.5 taels to 19 taels. However, the supply is not being replenished, while demand is still strong, so the trend is tight. Yesterday, those with few goods on hand were already asking for 19.5 taels. Although no deal was made, given the shortage of inventory, it is bound to rise again.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Principles of Labor Law by Xie Man</h3>
<p>Translated by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government stationed in Shanghai Investigation of Goods Office</p>
<p>Published by Qingyun Book Company</p>
<p>What is China's urgent problem?</p>
<p>In China's backward labor community and decadent industrial community, what is the most urgent problem? How will labor and capital build their backbones?</p>
<p>To resolve the disputes and darkness between labor and capital, we cannot deny the existence of important legislation between labor and capital. China has never paid attention to the legislation of labor and capital in all aspects. This is why China's labor community is backward, China's industrial community is decadent, and China's labor and capital have lost their vitality.</p>
<p>This magnum opus is translated from the book "Principles of Labor Legislation" co-authored by John R. Commons and John B. Andrews of the United States. The original book is divided into nine chapters, and the essentials of labor legislation are discussed in great detail. It has been known as the encyclopedia of labor law in Europe and the United States. Its value is naturally useless for us to open our mouths. However, this book only contains six chapters, because it is not very important to the situation in our country, so three chapters have been deleted. These six chapters are indeed important to the needs of our country.</p>
<p>The first chapter is "Essentials of Labor Legislation." In the first chapter, the "Labor Contract" is discussed in great detail with respect to "Industry," "Labor Law," and "Politics." The second section is an explanation of "Personal Rights." The third section is "Due Process of Law." In terms of "Public Power," the rights to maintain public order, enforce laws, levy taxes, protect, confiscate property, possess, police, commerce, and the rights of the federal government, the police power, and the constitution are all discussed in detail. In terms of "Authority," it is divided into four departments: executive, legislative, judicial, and management. In terms of principles, public interests and equal protection of laws are also discussed very appropriately. The second chapter is "The Meaning of Minimum Wage Legislation." The content is about the purpose of minimum wage legislation, the economic basis of minimum wage law, the historical development of minimum wage law, the standard of minimum wage, the implementation method of minimum wage law, the results after the implementation of minimum wage law, and the constitutional issues of the minimum wage law in the United States. Each item is discussed with reference to the actual examples of European and American countries.</p>
<p>The third chapter is "Working Hours," which discusses the maximum working hours for child labor, male labor, and female labor separately. There are more scientific and social bases for rest time.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter is "Unemployment Issues" clarifies the rules of private employment agencies, the rules of public employment agencies, the system control of public works, the organization and adjustment of industry.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter is "Factory Safety and Hygiene." It cites examples of factory safety and hygiene in factories in various countries, stipulates the prohibition of employing special workers, stipulates age restrictions, physical restrictions, and education restrictions for children, and explores the difficulties in implementing various child labor restrictions. For women, it distinguishes the prohibited occupations and the protection of parturients. For men, it stipulates physical qualifications and technical qualifications, and explains the prohibition of the use of special substances or equipment. Finally, it focuses on the management aspect, and describes the management of factories, the management of mines and tunnels, the management of the transportation industry, and the setting of management standards.</p>
<p>The sixth chapter is "Social Insurance," which first discusses industrial disaster insurance, and describes the regulations of employer responsibility regulations, the establishment of industrial disaster insurance, and the pension law in the United States. Secondly, it details health insurance, old-age and disability insurance, widow insurance system, and unemployment insurance system. There are many examples, and the regulations of various systems are detailed and complete.</p>
<p>Introducing this precise and detailed world magnum opus to China, where labor problems have become a major disaster to be resolved urgently, is naturally a cultural urgency and a gospel for the labor community.</p>
<p>This book has such a history and status in the world, and it will naturally open up a new life for the practical problems of both labor and capital.</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (169) by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 43: Italian Literature After the Renaissance</p>
<p>Italian dramatic literature was fused with music from a very early time, and music soon dominated speech. For three centuries, the whole world was singing, humming, or whistling the notes of Italian opera, and of those who remember who wrote the words, there is not one in a thousand. The modern Italian genius in the eyes of the rest of the world, or rather in its ears, is not a poet, not a novelist, nor the military politician Garibaldi, but the incomparable composer Giuseppe Verdi. He, indeed, even the great Wagner did not surpass him. Music is not within the scope of this brief overview, but we must never forget the close relationship between drama and poetry and song (song as a whole musical solution with the highest orchestral development). All the people of Europe (and perhaps Asia, Africa, and America) have made ballads. The Italians have always been the world's teachers of musical art - even the Germans must give way to this. Here arises the question of deeply interesting speculation (we can never find a definite answer): is there some relative relationship between the weakness of Italian poetry after Dante and the continuous magnificence of Italian music? And bringing this question to other countries, England, although it has beautiful folk songs, is notoriously weak in music, but in terms of the art of poetry, it is generally the strongest among the modern countries. In terms of the diversity of content and form, and in terms of the number of talented poets, it is also the most powerful. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Modern Italians, as mentioned above, are the direct heirs of the classics, but their classicism is not a piously submissive one. The Romantic movement, which began in the eighteenth century and reached its climax in the first half of the nineteenth century, captured and conquered the imagination of the Italians. The true or false translation of the works of the Gauls from the pen of Scottish poet James Macpherson, "Fingal" of Ossian, was translated by Cesarotti. It is not a question whether the Scottish man's work is a true translation or a false translation. In any case, he has shown his talent, and his romance has swept across Europe. The fact that Cesarotti's translation became one of Napoleon's favorite books is probably worth noting here.</p>
<p>Until recent times, the eccentric genius whose pure literary value was not recognized was Casanova. He was not originally a scholar, but in his "Memoirs," he discovered a beautiful prose style. The material may not be suitable for young people or those who are naively romantic, but for older people who understand the words, Casanova, like the English diarist Pepys, is one of the great self-revealers who accidentally comprehended the art of narration, and an artist who is not self-aware. His reputation is increasing with the passage of time. The English critic and philosopher Havelock Ellis wrote a beautiful and brilliant essay on him. His "Memoirs" belong to French literature, but he also wrote in Italian.</p>
<p>Italy has always been rich in comedy, but in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Italian theater became somewhat rigid and artificial (the French theater after Moliere and the English theater after Dryden were also like this). There was an Italian genius with a gift for rebuilding character comedy, namely Goldoni, a native of Venice. The characters he depicted are Venetians, more broadly, they are Italians, and more broadly, they are universal humans. He was very famous in France, but English translators seemed to have neglected him. His plays, even with their rich, true, and funny human nature, probably would not "pass" the English stage, but we can read his "Memoirs," which were translated many years ago and have a preface by Howell, the most famous novelist who served as the American consul in Venice.</p>

<h3>New Invention by Overseas Chinese Mr. Zheng Zhaoguang</h3>
<p>Water Surface Walking Device</p>
<p>Live Capture of Fierce Beast Cage</p>
<p>Singapore Correspondence: Mr. Zheng Zhaoguang, an overseas Chinese, is a native of Minhou, Fujian. He graduated from Fujian Private Gezhi Academy more than ten years ago and studied at Fujian Union University, Nanjing Southeast University, and Beiping Yenching University. He served as the head of the physics and chemistry department and a senior high school science teacher at Fujian Private Union Normal School for about five years. He has been a principal in various ports in Southeast Asia for many years. Recently, he invented a simple wireless crystal radio, etc. Mr. Zheng has organized the "Zheng Zhaoguang Radio Manufacturing Department" in Jasin, Malacca, Southeast Asia (DanielG·ChengRadioＤept·Jasin, Malaca：S·S). It has been approved and registered by the local government. Mr. Zheng not only has a profound research on radio, but also strives to study other sciences. More than ten years ago, when he had not left the country, he invented a wooden printing press, which is still in use in a printing shop. In 1923, Mr. Zheng invented the "Water Surface Walking Device". After years of research and improvement, it has become a safe and successful invention. It is said that anyone can put on this device and walk on the water at will, and can sit and lie down at will. When tired, they can paddle like a canoe and walk on the sea as if on land, unafraid of wind and waves. The invention of this device has a wide range of uses. For example, when fishermen work at sea, if they have this device, they will get great help. Recently, he also invented the "Live Capture of Fierce Beast Cage". This cage is placed in a forest rich in fierce beasts, using sheep as bait. When the fierce beast enters the cage, the cage door closes automatically. At the same time, a wire mesh can tightly bind the beast's body. The person capturing the beast is in an off-road vehicle designed by Zheng Zhaoguang, which can be equipped with a mobile camera to capture the natural living state of the beast at any time. This car has a special design, and the beast will not be alarmed or avoid it when it sees it. Passengers are at no risk, it is said.</p>

<h3>Research on Submarine Periscope</h3>
<p>Can Also See Through at Night</p>
<p>According to Japanese news, when submarines attack at night, the effect of stealth attacks has always been reduced because the periscope cannot see clearly. Also, during night exercises, there is often a risk of collision. According to the research results of the submarine department of the Wu Shipyard, the manufacture of a periscope that can also see through at night has been completed. Under the chairmanship of Endo, the head of the submarine department, an experiment was held a month ago. On the moonlit sea, the shadow of a ship can be recognized within 5,000 meters. In the dark night, the visual field within 500 meters can be correctly recognized. When the distance increases, the image is not clear, and it is completely invisible at 1,000 meters. Due to the inconvenience of narrowing the field of vision as the distance increases, there is still room for research in the future. It will be re-tested for four days using a dark night on the 23rd, it is said.</p>
<h3>Germany's Recent Dance Master</h3>
<p>Mr. Kubo, the president of the Kinran Association of Osaka, Japan, traveled around the civilized countries of the world to explore new styles of dance. Recently, he returned to China after completing his tour and described in detail to others that among the countries of the world, Germany's dance has reached its peak. The situation in that country is described as follows:</p>
<p>Nude Dance</p>
<p>I (Mr. Kubo refers to himself, same below) traveled to European and American civilized countries to study physical education dance, school dance, social dance, and stage dance. Now that I have returned after completing my tour, I have gained quite a bit about the world's dance. According to my research, Germany's physical education dance has reached its peak. There are more than 200 specialized dance schools. Among these many schools, the Wickman Schule in Berlin and the Schmiito Schule are the most outstanding, each accommodating four or five hundred to six or seven hundred students.</p>
<p>Modern Germany has become a nude paradise. Their nudity has achieved great victory under the maintenance of the state. This kind of nudity is flowing out. In fact, the German people hope to cultivate strong motherhood and strong citizens from this kind of nudity.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, no matter which dance school in Germany you go to, you will always see photos of bare bodies, exposed flesh. These photos are all openly hung on the walls. In the middle of the Albaum School, there are many nude statues arranged. Those nude photos with various postures can really serve as a guide for physical beauty and a textbook for healthy beauty.</p>
<p>German dancers are all naked when they rest after dancing. Most of the flower-like and jade-like girls are only wearing swimsuits, covering their twin breasts with inch-sized cloth.</p>
<p>The characteristic of physical education dance is that it can make the amount of exercise strong, extremely stretch the hands and feet, bend the body, and leap and spin to the left, right, up and down. That kind of posture is really magnificent and lively.</p>
<p>Modern Group Dance</p>
<p>In the Berlin area, I have seen stage dances several times. This kind of dance turns physical education dance into stage art. It completely disregards the method of individual dance and only performs dance under the organization and control of the group. This kind of dance is a group of dancers making spinning dance postures on the stage, either vertically or horizontally, driving the beautiful flesh, or on the ground or in the air, exhaustively showing the magic of thousands of changes. In terms of physical technology and training, they take group dance as the basis and create a group-like random dance.</p>
