<h3>日貴族院之新團體</h3>
<p>日本貴族院有爵議員聯合各派發起組織一新團體將在華族會館開成立會據聯合社謂係採取超黨派的態度作爲交换意見之機關電通社謂將以避免貴族院之政黨化防爲政治掮客所乘意蓋在謀設自固之防線此問題於日政局前途亦大有關繫。</p>
<p>日本之貴族院爲皇族華胃特權資産階級代表之總機關世界各國所鮮有其中雖有種種派别之組織如所謂研究會公正會火矅會等亦僅視爲一種社交團體與衆議院中之各政黨全異全異其趣而勢力則可操縱一切政治其爲不合於現代政治潮流早爲日人所公認故於前次運動普選時并大聲疾呼運動改革貴族院提出所謂改革貴族院之議案然其結果表面上雖經政府與貴族院恊議加以修正而通過其實則與不改革無異特權依然存在勢力並未稍减因是民對於該院近益加以非難目前該院内部所謂勅選議員頗受政黨化攻擊而又外鑒於衆院競選之劇烈無産黨在政黨中所佔之新勢力愈見强固平民主義日益發展則回顧自身階級相去太遠益不合於今日之潮流勢將無以自存故亟亟焉務先自謀聯絡鞏固團體以爲防禦外力進攻之用新團體之組設用意不外如是而民已</p>

<h3>昨日樂華不幸失敗</h3>
<p>二對三威西德勝</p>
<p>緃横滬濱號稱足球界中之　子樂華足球隊、昨日與威西德比賽、竟遭其毒手、而以二對三受挫、凡親臨逸　作壁上客者、莫不同浩暵、相與　傷、蓋九十分鐘之逐鹿、雙方勢均力歒、旗鼓相當、徒以内衛、馮運佑受傷不在、内外賽力、感受應響、遂至勝利在握者竟而喪師敗北、榮華抑何不幸之甚耶、</p>
<p>樂華右翼陳噳添爲當時前鋒中唯一之危險人物、能跑能挑、有思想、又靈巧、一身造成不少之機會、惜其同伴不善運用、致所得成効有限、樂華之獲得二球、間接由其挑送合度之功績也、李惠堂多才多藝、昨任中堅、成績良佳、如馮在塲、則彼以左内置、得噳添贊助、至少可多獲二三球、而保持其長勝之榮譽也、威西德前鋒射擊工夫、亦頗平常、特長之點、在乎内外實力相均、加以體魄之偉梧、膂力之健壯、勝利之來、亦非完全由於僥倖、</p>
<p>按西人會正式通告、前日乃高級盃賽、昨日爲甲組賽、忽而二隊同意、互相調動、故二日比賽之結果、樂華在甲組賽中、打得和局　而昨日高級盃賽則損失上進奪標之機會也、</p>
<h3>樂華隊陣綫</h3>

<p>周賢言　　　　　李惠堂　　　　　戴麟經</p>

<p>史諾克　　　　　　　　麥山史　　　　史諾克</p>
<p>聶高兒　　　　史蒂芬　　　　卡　脱</p>
<p>奥史門</p>
<p>史丹諾匹馬奪關　裁判員頓納銀　聽起、威西德撥球進攻、樂華利用風力、一鼓而下、敵人目而對烈陽、觀綫閃耀、樂華大軍、乃得深入腹地　敵方内衛堅强、球遂反趨　來勢凶惡、樂華門前、飽受驚駭、陳鎭和退立門旁、與周合作、大患方去、不料二度進攻、又在目前、右前衛史蒂芬猛射一球、周雙手抱得、中鋒史諾克　身冲之周幾倒地、幸能及時抛出、左翼史丹福得機重夾、四馬奪關、竟告成功、</p>
<p>戴麟經一頭中的　樂華於三分鐘之内、突遇平反之機、其時敵入方得一球、氣勢大盛、全軍齊出、内部空虞、王雍劼身對空門、不料被守門所擋、未竟全功、誠憾事也、樂華右翼陳虞添表演絶佳、一再傳中、敵當合度、敵人視之如虎、不敢遠離、但陳迅速靈巧、依然出没自在、戴麟經之頂入一球、亦由其挑送之力也、</p>
<p>陳家球脚下有限　雙方勝負旣等、相戰益烈、陳虞添踼角至佳、一次中堅李惠堂乘人不備、忽而加入前綫、猛然一脚、如非稍高數寸、又將加添一球矣、威西德亦累次進攻、幾度打門、然以樂華防衛嚴密　屢進屢退、最後二分鐘間、陳虞添又有驚人之挑送、守門與前鋒互相衝突、同仆地上、球出不遠、陳家球自後赶至、脚下有眼、向人羣空𨻶處射出、聶高兒撲地阻之、稍遲一步、�</p>
<p>但見一球滾去、没入網内、樂華乃以二對一占先、未幾上半時告終、</p>
<p>威西德絶處逢生　戰雲再展之中、威西德境内　多控制於樂華手中、偶而反攻、不過作無聊之射擊、陳虞添已改爲内鋒、與戴合作、極有精彩、一路勢如破竹、將近門前、陳舉足攻擊守門早有防備、被其擋出成角　無效而退、陳鎭和捲土重來、深入邊垂、挑球塲中、奚巧生假一脚、球向門右角射去、内衛勃司拚命一頂、威西德乃絶處逢生矣、</p>
<p>史諾克守門有功　大難不死、必有得後福、威西德軍容漸壯、表演驚人、其時適逢樂華球員、疲乏不堪、故益得盡量攻擊、不遣餘力、五分鐘之内、史諾克與奥司蒙各中一球、反以三對二領前、樂華反勝爲敗、雄心仍在、陳家球傳球左方、陳虞添已自右調左、乘勢帶地疾進、一時及收足、被守門史諾克奪去、威西德能保持勝局、其守門史諾克之功也、結果威西德以三對二勝樂華、得高級　决賽權、</p>

<h3>我對這次分區賽後的廻感（上）</h3>
<p>李惠堂</p>
<p>和我們小别了差不多三星期、轟立在海關屋頂上的大自鳴鐘、鐺鐺地又於前日下午、歡迎我們重返春申了、我們這次分區比賽、連航程一共費了十有九天、在這很短的期間内、我們却幹了不少的事業、走了不少的途程、而且其中選有很多有價値而値得我們重提的事因此我便有這一首廻感的寫出、華東在這次的分區賽中是失敗了、失敗的原因種種、我且放下慢談、不過我在這失敗裏頭、却發生一種特别的快感、爲的是我們華東這次南下、純綷由樂華代表、樂華稱雄滬上、那是誰也知到的、這次在港竟然受挫於南方、兄弟那可證我華人的足球人材、是遍皆是、而使居我國的外人、知道我華人在足球界的勢是他們所應畏敬的尙有其他很多的經過、因爲篇幅的關係、使我不能日記式和盤托出、我現在祇好簡單地擇其要者　把我的意思寫在下面、　　關於這次招待方面　關於分區賽會招待方面、我因爲身暦華東南北三區、經騐所得、確算華南最爲妥當、最爲熱烈而誠懇、我們這次南下、眞有賓至如歸之樂、除了港恊會特地選出一個招待委員會招待我們、和領我們到省澳游覧外、還有南華體育會精武體育會中華體育會太古會所中華游樂會華人游泳會福建體育會、廣州恊進會嶺南大學校等團體、和何東爵紳余仕榮羅文緯何世　劉伯偉等私人的酒　茶會、眞是顧左失右、應接不暇、他如皇后影戲院和利舞　的請我們看戲、也値得我們感謝到十二分、有人説這次港恊會招待你到這個地步、不過因爲打了兩次和局收人突比預算來得多的關係罷了、我想這人之斯言、一定是帶着滑稽意味、</p>
<p>關係辦事方面　這次的分區賽、所有辦事人員、都是由港恊會特别委請的、各行各事、有條不紊、眞値得我們的敬仰、尤其是招待主任黄錦英先生、他老人家能夠犧牲他的光陰和生意、鎭日連夜地混在我們隊裏、作我們的老馬、他的精神和盛意、使我們纫感萬分、總而言之、這次彼方辦事的成績、可算得是常佳妙、雖然有時顧不到的地方也有、像第二次比賽用舊球等類、不過那總是算多不脱的微疵罷了、</p>
<p>關於這次比賽的　這次比賽的經過、我們雖然經了兩塲和局而到底失敗、但是天下事常常不可以成敗論英雄、我胆敢説我、這次的失敗、是幸運上的失敗、而非藝術上的失敗、單個上雖然　東隊内也有很多國手、但是論到合作傳球氣力種種、誰也公認我們是比較上　高一着、我們雖然失了錦標、但是像西人説的De　eated　B-t　Not　Disgraced　、我們却没有失了面子、我們在第一二兩塲在最後三分鐘内、仍不能保持必勝之局、可説是幸　使然、第二塲因着全隊疲倦和賢言同志、脅骨幾斷、難於撑持、遂不得已地　那敗北的滋味、然而我們雖　是身返此地、我們的藝術的留影、　未當　我們同歸、却會永遠的印在港人的腦海間　而使他們再也不敢輕視我們了、怪不得港中眼光較遠的人們説、　東的足球比較上進步、眞可謂一日千里了、由此看來、從前　南球隊所有的威舉、恐怕不久就要逹到華東去了、看罷、未完、</p>

<h3>慧猴獻技</h3>
<p>— 芳菲</p>
<p>曩　於電影中見有猴爲人削鉛筆。狀絶伶俐。此次在京。友人介一程君與予弈。談次偶及人類進化之理。程君言猴於獸族中。性最與人爲近、友並言程君蓄一猴、甚慧。約是往過其盧覘其技術。届時往訪、則屋隣於予外大母家。固予所常經過者。程君欵待甚殷、旋於宅後抱一猴出。小如周歲之婴、目光炯炯殊不畏人。程君自案頭檢一秃首之鉛筆及一小刀予之。猴即試削。久久不能成頴。忽擲之地上。跳　而出。吾輩大笑。程君乃追之返。佯脅以怒色。猴瑟縮旁坐。狀甚可憐。程君更取一磁盆。置一手巾於内、令洗。猴若不解。程君大聲呵叱。並自作式示之。猴遂探手入盆。洗之再四。其狀一如老於洗衣之澣婦。予力贊其慧。程君似頗欣悦。又面猴叱曰。傘。猴奔至複室。曳一傘出程君曰。撑。猴乃徐徐捫得機括。欲使之張開。而以力弱不能承重。墮地復合。即戰慄偎坐於程君足次似有乞憐之意。程君笑撫以手。始解顔他去。予詢程君以此猴來歷。君謂係其父游黄山。自山麓某鄉人處購得者。此鄉人以捕猴出售爲業。常猴僅售四五金。此獨索價二十金。時已令作普通簡易之小游戲。購歸後加以訓練。愈見敏俊。同時尙購有一牝猴。略解人語。亦能拾奉瑣物。特以軀幹較修。小兒畏之甚。又因係牝體。竟如婦女之有經期。家人惡而贈諸人。受者不善約束。一夕。竟爲破索遁去。自是附近一帶。常被其擾。卒爲人以獵槍擊斃。程君又云。小猴初來時。不畏人而極畏犬。君家原蓄有一守門之犬。遇猴甚善。常嗅以鼻。而猴驚啼奔避。狼狽萬狀。君乃去犬留猴。蓋君之視猴。不啻一襁褓之兒。愛護之唯恐不至也。</p>
<h3>酆都</h3>
<p>— 羽盦</p>
<p>俗　以酆都爲鬼域。與山東兗州。同爲世人心目中恐怖之窟。匪惟婦女信之。在昔通人學士。亦多不能打破此等迷信。而謂爲寗可信其有。不可信其無者實則酆都亦爲尋常之縣邑耳。方象瑛使蜀日記有云。縣有仙都觀麻姑洞。號紫府眞君之居。不知何時創森羅殿。因傳會爲閣君洞。以爲即地獄之酆都。蓋道流惑世失其實耳。又范成大湖船錄。中州酆都縣。去縣三里有平都山。碑碟所傳。前漢王方平。後漢陰長生。皆在此得道仙去。有陰君丹爐。是酆都陰君。乃陰長生。俗訛爲幽冥之主。因以酆都爲鬼伯所居。殊謬。酆都前屬忠州。故云。入民國。改屬東川道。又酆都初名豐都。楊隋所置。至明始易豐。爲酆。其傳會爲幽冥之域。良不知明於何時。頃在某旅社晤一吳某。互道姓氏里居。則赫然爲酆都縣人。因叩以有無異跡。曰否。訛傳耳。唯本地人亦極迷信。謂下午六時後。鬼即上市。各商店在門首置一水盆。凡來市物者。必置錢於水。沉者爲人。浮則爲鬼。顧亦未嘗見有浮者特爲父老相傳。有此一俗。今世科學昌明。亦有知其謬而破除之者矣。又其地於城隍誕日。舁偶像出巡。謂之出會。以卜大有。非出會則風雨必下以時。故每年舉行一次。出巡時。不能任意停輿。有一定之地點。否則中途停輿於某人門首某人即不利。將有疾死亡。甚騐。則又不僅酆都獨異。易地皆然。如吾吳陵。即有此等迷信。城隍之輿。最忌駐於人家門首。吳某又言。若云異跡。其惟流沙坡乎。流沙坡者。爲流沙擁積而成。下有巨坑。沙流自下而上。終歲不輟。而坡上之沙。不見某多。坡下之沙。亦不見某减。因此發生種種不經之談。然亦與鬼域無關也。總之。有鬼無鬼。固尙未能處斷。酆都實爲尋常縣邑。了無足異。在昔旅行困難。他省人足跡難到。遂至以訛傳訛。今則輪轂交通。往來極易。果有所疑。正不妨一履其境。而覘究竟。百聞不如一見。吾知此等迷信。不出三十年。即將完全打破矣。</p>

<p>元　宵晚飯後。微步於徐匯東街。値友人陸君及其未婚妻。因相赴近舍觀燈。燈凡數百。作一長柱形。俗謂爲塔燈。其燭光雖暗淡。要亦不失爲奇觀矣。興盡。辭陸君歸。陸君强留作片刻語。語予曰。弟自遺伊求學以來。所費不資。而欠人太巨。索債聲急。心殊不安。乞下借百金。以濟燃眉。一待家欵匯來。當即歸趙。予以無金却之。彼婉詞相商者約半小時。然阮囊羞澀。有心無力。陸君乃鬱然去。夫陸君本小康家。乃父每年予以讀晝費六百金。年有餘欵。購晝盈室。恒以晝生自居。今則爲戀愛問題。竟搖尾乞憐於人。亦可　哀已。忙裏記之。用以自警。</p>

<h3>觀荀慧生演埋香幻劇記</h3>
<p>— 老拙</p>
<p>星期三晚觀戀生新排新劇之埋香幻。慧生飾張盈盈。與鳥媒媚作女紅於繡樓。適劉生千鍾過其樓下。睨之而笑。遂種情根。嗣盈盈爲母病　於神廟。爲强暴吳二所窘。急遽奪門出。欲逃避於鳥媪處。而誤入媪家。此吳鳥諧音之誤之幻也。復由吳媪家中逃出。不期而過千鍾。乃送之歸。一路情話縣縣。遂訂終身。此情之幻也。劉父終日醉鄉。聞蜚語不加細察。逕自登門逼退婚約。此麯秀才之幻也。盈盈羞念。呑玉悶絶。母愛女情深。特爲厚殮。吳蝹子與鳥媒媪皆鬼妝而往盜棺。（盜棺暗塲俾免觸忌觀者眼　甚是）猝相遇。互驚仆。吳甦而媪死。此扮鬼之幻也。棺啟。吳出女口中玉。女慶生還。趨千鍾家。千鍾詫爲鬼物。擊女倒地。俄辨其人。父子棄家逃此疑鬼之幻也。鳥媪子適里正。守女屍。女又復活。濳入千鍾臥房。易男裝以行。此迷離撲朔之幻也。鳥疑屍變。持梃追逐。適值吳媒媪經過。遂誤斃之。此又桃僵李代之幻也。通體設想非非。無一非幻境。具見心思。頗足令人解頣。而戀生是劇之丰神態度處處脗合聰明才貌之閨秀。喬裝後。邂逅劉父，僞託寒暄。而爲重訂駌盟計。輙以言詞挾之。此一節白口犀利異常。狀貌亦酷肖美男子。途遇千鍾二六一段。以（救我殘生表我貞）我字旋繞四五板。跌入貞字。唱法甚佳。若曰女子之貞之不可忽視也。特鄭重以出之。意尤顯明。公堂快流水（昏沉入棺木被吳二盜墓偷墳險些兒失了身。）如此長句。似不易安排。而唱者却能極閃板搶板之能事。圓轉自如。全劇配搭亦甚齊整。演時僅及二句鐘。尙不支蔓冗沓。滋可取也。</p>
<h3>心上温韾　（一三○）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回　瓊筵開處嬌鳥啼花　金屋妝成良禽擇木</p>
<p>上海的女閭都齊集於福州路一帶。人所共知。這是他們的地盤。其餘的所謂野鷄妓女。散處各方。低級的在胡家宅左右。高級的却在南京路前後。</p>
<p>那高級的大半是擺碰和台子。從前外國式器具。還没有似現在那般流行。房間裏以紅木傢具爲最高等。稱之爲紅木房間。一樣的也可以擺酒請客。不過不照堂子裏排塲。因此後來有人選舉花國總統的當兒。把幾條堂子衖堂。比諸各省。如清和坊迎春坊小花園等等。每處有一位都督。而不在四馬路區域内的。如貴州路等處。稱之爲特别區域。我今且説貴州路二號。即在南京路轉灣的地方。有一家野鷄堂子。是個最高等的。裏面新到了一位姑娘。初來的時候。人家還不甚注意。因爲伊也不大出門。不比下級的那種鷄妓女。每天要上茶館。拉客人。那個地方。就是幾個走熟的人。進去碰和。吃吃烟。所謂擺碰和檯子。又謂之住家。因爲來了這一位新人物。大家説伊標緻。本來臣門如水的。　一轉間便臣門如市。也是在明鏡俱樂部常來的一位朋友。説起貴州路二號。有這樣一位人物。照伊那樣一隻面孔。晝庽裏簡直没有像伊的。可惜是落在野鷄妓院之中。眞是天涯何處無芳草。十室之邑。必有忠信。那位先生也是晝獃子。搖頭播腦的歎息了一陣子。一時大家爲他所聳動。好奇之心。便鼓起尋芳探艷之思。説好在貴州路不遠。我們便去實地探檢一下。那時告奮勇的便有四五人。嚴一塵鄭彦修却在其内。到了貴州路來的報告。大家都説名不虚傳。這在野鷄妓院中總算是找不出第二個人了。是野鷄中的大王。於是這野鷄大王四個字。你也如此説。我也如此説。便傳出了名咧。其實伊的名字叫素君。恰巧那時候。在么二妓院中。也崛起了一位英雄。名字唤做文素香。大家就唤伊爲么二大王。蘭孫就唤伊爲么王。於是同時代便有兩個大王。一個是么王文素香。一個是野鷄大王素君。「此大王之雌風也。而今安在哉。」可是當初却名震一時。這位鄭彦修。對於許多妓女。皆覺得餘子碌碌。不足齒數。惟有對於那位大王。却是非常傾倒。不惜屈體稱臣。雖然有人説。野鷄大王其名不雅馴。他却説吕雉尙爲國后。何足道哉。</p>

<h3>紗花　世界原棉之供需與年俱進</h3>
<p>世界原棉之生産與銷費、從歴年統計數字研究之、均在與年俱進之中、觀於下列各表、吾人當知美棉産額雖執世界之牛耳、但其他各種棉産亦日見增進、已漸據於有力地位、英國大戰前每年銷用美棉三百六十六萬七千包、而用他種棉七十七萬八千包、但一九二九年銷用美棉僅及戰前百分之四十八、而銷用他種棉花則爲百分之一百三十一之比也、</p>

<h3>昨日試飛海鵰</h3>
<p>沈得變親自駕駛</p>
<p>海軍部編處前由福建馬江製造所訂造之最大戰鬥飛機一架、定名海鵰、業已裝配完竣、故定於本月十六日、在海軍部飛機處試飛茲悉昨日下午三時、由航空處長沈得爕、親自由海軍飛機塲駕駛、升入空中、首在高昌廟海軍部沿江一帶試飛、週翻飛、至下午四時、始駛返高昌廟海軍飛機塲降下、結果成績甚佳云、</p>

<h3>美國婦女美術展鑒　昌溪</h3>
<p>最國紐約的全國婦女繪畫雕刻聯合會舉行第三十九次的展鑒、把全國的婦女的作品都陳列在美術展鑒會中、在這會中包含有三百六十幅畫、三十九件雕刻、二十幅彩色畫像、許多黑白相雜的近代繪畫、而且在開會中並公佈一種獎金來獎勵女子從事這方面的工作、不過、這個畫展許多人很不滿意、以爲假如、不是婦女、他們和一羣觀者都要在事實上受騙、而且色調反不如康里女士自歐洲歸來的個人展鑒更値得注意、</p>
<p>康里女士Ｒｈｅｏｒｄｏｒａ　Ｋａｎｅ是有國際聲譽的畫家、伊的雜記和水彩畫是很得着贊譽、雖然現在僅有二十三歲、但伊早已蜚聲于倫郭·巴黎·維也納的畫壇了、伊在歐洲各國早已舉行過多次的展鑒、	現在把她五年來在異邦寫下的五六十件作品在美國的家鄉紐約作第一次公開的展鑒、</p>

<h3>乳房禮讚　　日葵</h3>
<p>你乳如百合花中吃草的一對小鹿就是鹿雙生的一對藥山乳香岡去</p>

<p>你乳如樹上的果纍纍下垂</p>

<p>你乳如葡萄纍纍</p>
<p>我們早晨起來往葡萄園去看看葡萄可曾發芽可曾開花</p>
<p>丨舊約「歌中之歌」</p>
<p>讀過基督教舊約聖經的、可還記得在所羅門王謳唱的「歌中之歌」裏面、有上面這樣二段「乳房禮讚」、</p>
<p>藝術作品中、最富於誘惑性剌戟性同時令人感到至上美麗的感覺性的就是女性袒胸的彫刻塑像和繪畫、同樣地在文學作品中、無論詩歌也得散文也得、最美麗動人的、自然就是一切讚美女性肉體美的作品、現在就案頭書籍、隨便引錄幾個斷片、以資談助、</p>
<p>在西方古代文藝作品中、除了上面説過的一部舊約聖經以外、還有許多古代的詩篇、最著名要算古希臘的戀歌了、希臘本來是一個肉的狂醉的國度、在法國邊勒魯意（Ｐｉｅｎｅ　Ｌｏｕｉｙｓ）重譯的「碧麗蒂的歌」裏面、（有李金髮中譯本、即古希臘戀歌、）有一首呌做「給我的乳房、」　　開着花的肉、</p>
<p>啊我的乳房、你是何等富於肉懲啊、</p>
<p>我的乳房在手裏、</p>
<p>何以你有這種疲乏、疲乏的熱氣、及新鮮的芳香、</p>
<p>往昔你是像大理石像、胸膛般的冰冷、無知無覺的大理石般硬、自從你屈撓了、我更加鍾愛你、你被愛者啊、</p>
<p>你的外形光滑而鉋滿、是我赤色肉體的榮譽、無論我因爲你在金色髮綱下、或者我全裸了交給你、都爲了你比我先有了光輝的綠故、</p>
<p>今夜盡情享樂罷、如果我的手指、新發明了撫摸術、只有你明朝能知道、這一夜是Ｂ付錢給Ｂ啊、</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>我很懷疑這些戀歌都出於魯意的手筆、並不是什麽碧麗蒂的謳歌、聰明的魯意吓、你爲什麽要把這樣美麗的詩歌、讓美給紀元前六世紀的一個希臘妓女呢、在他的「阿弗洛弟德」小説中、（有東亞病夫與虚白合譯的中譯本、即「肉與死」、最近聞又有人重譯、改名「美的性生活」、）</p>
<p>他又借托是印度的戀歌、使葛麗雪與笪若拉主婢兩人、這樣對唱道、</p>
<p>丨你的乳房、是兩箇銀盾、乳尖兒浸過了血痕、</p>
<p>丨我有乳房是團圞的明月、月兒的返照、搖晃在水中、</p>
<p>這些戀歌都是多麽有魅力吓、東亞病夫在譒譯「肉與死」的時候、一定受了魯易這些黄金詩句的感應、所以常他執筆創作「魯男子」也使他衝動起關於女性肉體禮讚的靈感了、我們試讀湯雲鳳自已嗼賞乳房的一叚罷、</p>
<p>酥胸袒露、在水紅鮫綃兜肚的霧穀裏、掩映着雙雙含苞的睡蓮、印出淡緊的花帶、這還是去年初夏、無意中在平坦的玉田裏、新發現的奇葩、在發現時、全身感受着不可知的顫動、漸漸地綻露了、漸漸在成長了、到如今彷彿已結成了核心、……</p>
<p>在中國文字中、原也不少關於描寫女性乳房的佳句妙詞、我們不便一一引證在這裏、</p>
<p>那些謳歌女性的詩人們、都善歡用象徵的描寫來比喻乳房、好像小鹿、葡萄果銀盾明月睡蓮玉峯鷄頭、但是這許多象徵的形容字眼、沿用得太濫陳丁、最近我讀見日本掘口大學的一首「乳房」、却充滿了奇言妙想、只是這一首詩、可以打倒其他古今來一切的「乳房禮讚」了、現在根據白璧先生的譯文、抄錄在篇末、我相信在故舊的羊皮卷或線訂本裏、總也尋不到這樣清新的乳房禮讚了罷、</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Proclamation to Soldiers</h3>
<p>Implementing Demobilization and Preventing Internal Strife as a Plan for Peaceful Unification</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang, as a caution to the military from the heads of the five Yuan, published a short article yesterday titled "Implementing Demobilization and Preventing Internal Strife as a Plan for Peaceful Unification," elaborating on the distinction between internal war and internal strife, and the difference between rebellion and suppression. The full text is recorded below: The heads of the five Yuan of the National Government, adhering to the aim of peaceful unification and cherishing the revolutionary soldiers, issue this proclamation to all our soldiers. Regarding the way to save oneself and others, we spare no effort to explain in detail and earnestly advise. All those loyal to the Party and the country, and loyal to the revolution, should be vigilant and inspired, acting in accordance with this to live up to the expectations of the government and fulfill the duty of our revolutionary soldiers. I, Zhongzheng, humbly serve as the commander-in-chief, and have always emphasized the meaning of the Prime Minister's instructions to our revolutionary soldiers regarding the distinction between obedience and defiance, and the distinction between righteousness and self-interest. I have repeatedly encouraged them. Even today, the leaders of the Party and the country have repeatedly explained this to supervise and guide us. This is indeed what Zhongzheng feels guilty about, and what all my comrades should feel ashamed of. The key point of the admonishment from the heads of the five Yuan is that our soldiers should be public-minded in their actions and should not have any selfish thoughts. This is not only a prerequisite for our soldiers to save the Party, the country, and the people, but also the only good strategy for our soldiers to save themselves. If we are public-minded, our revolutionary character can be developed, our revolutionary history can be preserved, and our revolutionary cause can be completed. If we are selfish, it will not only be enough to degrade our revolutionary character, tarnish our revolutionary history, and destroy our revolutionary cause, but also our very survival as revolutionary soldiers cannot be guaranteed. For revolutionary soldiers, success or failure is not important, gain or loss is not worth mentioning, but the distinction between obedience and defiance, and the distinction between public and private interests, must be strictly observed. Zhongzheng is willing to work with my comrades to take the admonishments from the heads of the five Yuan as a lifelong guide, so that the government's policy of peaceful unification can be thoroughly implemented, and our soldiers will not stray into the wrong path and be spurned by the world and future generations. As for the plan for peaceful unification, the heads of the five Yuan have also clearly shown us that the implementation of demobilization and the prevention of internal war are the only guidelines. If demobilization cannot be implemented, those who hold military power will not only defend themselves with their troops, but even expand their forces and compete with each other, making China have no hope of unification for a long time. If internal war cannot be stopped, they will fight each other, and as one is destroyed, another will rise, causing China to have no day of peace forever. The distinction between internal war and internal strife is especially important for my comrades to clearly recognize. Internal war refers to the private struggles between warlords. For example, during the Spring and Autumn period two thousand years ago, although the states competed for hegemony, they still respected the name of the central government and dared not rebel or act as the chief culprit. This can be called internal war. As for those who seize territory and claim military power, coerce the central government, arbitrarily change laws, and destroy discipline, this is internal strife and cannot be compared to internal war. If internal strife is not quelled, unification will be difficult to achieve. If unification is not achieved, it will not only cause the country to be divided and the people to be displaced, but the nation will also be doomed forever and will never have independence and freedom. When internal strife is about to occur but has not yet broken out, the central government will do its utmost to persuade those who are about to cause trouble to repent and stop the trouble, so as to maintain unity and peace. But once the trouble has broken out and cannot be stopped, the central government for revolutionary national salvation has no choice but to take the path of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, in order to fulfill its due responsibilities. The responsibility of the revolutionary government lies in quelling rebellions and stabilizing the country, eradicating feudal forces, and sanctioning reactionary acts, so as to realize the peaceful unification of the country and the independence and equality of the nation. If it cannot stop internal war and cannot quell internal strife, it must be selfish, complacent, condoning evil and rewarding chaos, and harming the country and the people. If a government tolerates this, how can it be called a revolutionary government? People have mistakenly regarded internal strife as internal war, leading to a confusion of right and wrong, and the country will be destroyed in no time. Therefore, Zhongzheng spares no effort to repeatedly explain this to my comrades. Our soldiers should especially know that the army belongs to the Party and the country, and only follows the orders of the Party and the country. The central government is the only highest central government of the Party and the country. Since we call ourselves revolutionary soldiers, we should fulfill the responsibilities of the revolution, and the only way to fulfill the responsibilities of the revolution is to always obey the central government and wholeheartedly support the central government. The central government is the central government of all the people of the country, and also the central government of all my comrades, not the central government of one person or a few people. Our soldiers cannot be separated from the central government for a day. Without the central government, our revolutionary life will have no place to rely on. Therefore, those who cut themselves off from the Party and the country, and cut themselves off from the central government, are cutting themselves off from their own lives. In summary, we can know that those who raise troops and cause trouble, and resist the central government, are called rebellion, which is internal strife. Sanctioning the rebellious and quelling the internal strife is called suppression, not internal war. This is the distinction between obedience and defiance, and the distinction between public and private interests, which our soldiers must understand clearly. Zhongzheng humbly wishes to encourage each other with my comrades. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Hopes Yan Xishan Will Rein in His Horse</h3>
<p>Telegraphs Zhao Daiwen to Please Correct Yan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin telegraphed Zhao Daiwen on the 15th, requesting him to correct Yan Baichuan. The original telegram reads: "I have respectfully received your telegram. The success of the National Revolution must go through political tutelage. Since we are Party members, we should be responsible. Rights can be given up, but duties cannot be abandoned. During the Xinhai Revolution, the Prime Minister was the head of state, extremely honored. Later, he traveled and suffered, overcoming many dangers, fighting to the end, and never changing until his death. It was not that he did not give up. Baichuan's telegraph only knows about personal honor and forgets the responsibility to the Party and the people. A slight difference will lead to a great error. At this time when the people are sick and the country is in danger, it is absolutely inappropriate to create disputes and cause internal strife. If Baichuan sincerely intends to resign, he can simply go abroad to recuperate to quell rumors. If he wants to serve the people, please support the central government, jointly maintain national affairs, and overcome difficulties. This will be upright and bright, and will not use the good name of concession to endanger the country. Sir, you are loyal to the Party and the country, and uphold the gentlemanly virtue of loving others with virtue. I hope you will correct Baichuan, rein in his horse at the edge of the cliff, and not be misled by politicians, leading the people of Shanxi to a place of no return."

<h3>He Chengjun Once Telegraphed Yan to Earnestly Advise</h3>

He also advised him to reflect immediately and make amends. Yan replied in a telegram with extremely simple words and active intentions. He plans to telegraph again to encourage him. He plans to go to Nanjing before the Third Plenary Session to meet with Chiang to discuss important matters. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Mo Dehui Left Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hosted the Press Circle Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Hosted a Farewell Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang hosted a banquet at the headquarters on the 16th evening to bid farewell to Mo Dehui. After the banquet, Mo crossed the river and went north. During his stay in Beijing, Mo listened carefully to the central government's intentions regarding important matters of Sino-Russian diplomacy. After leaving Beijing, in addition to briefly contacting the officials along the way, he will first return to Panyang to discuss everything thoroughly with the Northeast authorities. He is scheduled to go to Moscow in about two weeks to hold the Sino-Russian conference. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mo Dehui hosted reporters in and out of Beijing on the 16th afternoon, reporting on the progress of the Eastern Railway negotiations and the future goals. He briefly stated that the China Eastern Railway has been jointly operated by China and Russia since 1896, when the Sino-Russian agreement on the joint operation of the China Eastern Railway was signed. China only nominally sent a director, and the Russians used the railway for political aggression. In 1917, the Russian Revolution occurred, and China took the opportunity to recover the railway's security and other powers. In 1919, Soviet Russia declared that it would unconditionally return the railway and all its assets to China. Unfortunately, the government at that time did not take the opportunity to fully recover it, and only the Ministry of Communications and the Daosheng Bank signed another contract, each sending five directors to exercise the highest powers of the railway, and added a Chinese deputy director. Until 1924, when China formally recognized Soviet Russia, the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement was successively signed, stipulating the regulations for managing the railway, and agreeing to convene a meeting within four months to discuss the powers of the director. Later, because the points to be discussed were mostly in our favor, Soviet Russia repeatedly postponed it and used the regulations to control the railway bureau and promote communism, resulting in various facts that endangered the Chinese government and social security, leading to the July 10th incident last year. After the dispute arose, Russian troops launched a large-scale border harassment. The provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang did their best to resist, and they obeyed the central government's orders to strictly adhere to the spirit of the non-aggression pact and not retaliate. Because of the disparity in strength, the Northeast authorities could not bear the great sacrifice on the border, so they painfully negotiated peace, leading to the signing of the Khabarovsk Record. It is said that there is an annex to it. I dare to guarantee with my personal integrity that it is not the case. Since arriving in Beijing, I have discussed with the central authorities several times, and my opinions have been mostly adopted, leading to the previous declaration. The government has repeatedly ordered me to serve as a representative to the conference. Although I have declined repeatedly, I have not dared to refuse because of my current position. I have asked Chairman Chiang to appoint cadres from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Railways, who will be able to leave soon. My personal opinion on this conference is based on the spirit of the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement. First, we should discuss the method of redeeming the railway. The Fengtian Agreement stipulates that Soviet Russia will unconditionally return the railway to China after 60 years. Before the expiry date, China can redeem it at a price. At this conference, I am not sure whether a fair value can be assessed and whether there will be any unexpected disputes in the payment. Even if there is no result, we must temporarily sign a contract for the joint operation of the railway based on the spirit of the Sino-Russian Fengtian Agreement and the principle of joint commercial operation between the two countries. The responsibility is heavy, and I am afraid I will not be able to bear it. What I can swear is that I will be loyal and fearless, and I will strive to recover national rights to the greatest extent possible. I hope that you will give guidance from time to time, and awaken the compatriots of the whole country to work together in harmony. This is not only my personal fortune, but also the fortune of the Party and the country. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>

(14) The language used by the China Eastern Railway should be changed to both Chinese and Russian. (15) Russian troops must not be stationed in Manzhouli. (16) Soviet Russia should immediately stop inciting Mongolian youth to make trouble in Hailar. (17) It should be stipulated in the new treaty that Soviet Russia must not induce Outer Mongolia to secede from China.

(19) The time limit for recovery should be further shortened. (20) The Articles of Association of the East Province Railway Company were made in the era of Imperial Russia and should be revised. (21) The organization of the railway should be the same as the organization of the national railway bureau of our country. (22) Railway subsidiary undertakings, such as agriculture, forestry, mining, cartography, observatories, schools, etc., should be taken over and operated by Chinese official authorities.

<h3>The New Group in the Japanese House of Peers</h3>
<p>The joint organization of the Japanese House of Peers by members with titles has initiated a new group, which will hold an inaugural meeting at the Huazu Hall. According to the United Press, it will adopt a non-partisan attitude as a mechanism for exchanging opinions. The Electric Communication Agency stated that it will avoid the politicization of the House of Peers and prevent it from being taken advantage of by political brokers, with the intention of establishing a self-defense line. This issue is also closely related to the future of the Japanese political situation.</p>
<p>The Japanese House of Peers is the general organization of the representatives of the imperial family, aristocrats, and privileged propertied class, which is rare in countries around the world. Although there are various factions and organizations within it, such as the so-called Research Association, Justice Association, and Fire Club, they are only regarded as social groups, completely different from the various political parties in the House of Representatives. However, its power can manipulate all politics. Its incompatibility with the modern political trend has long been recognized by the Japanese. Therefore, during the previous universal suffrage movement, they loudly called for reform of the House of Peers and proposed the so-called reform of the House of Peers bill. However, as a result, although the government and the House of Peers superficially reached an agreement to revise and pass it, in fact, it was no different from not reforming. Privileges still existed, and the power was not reduced at all. Therefore, the people have increasingly criticized the House of Peers. At present, the so-called members appointed by imperial order within the House are under attack from politicization. Seeing the fierce competition in the House of Representatives elections, and the new strength of the proletarian party in the political parties is becoming stronger and stronger, and the growth of the democratic way, then looking back at its own class is too far apart, and even more does not conform to today's trend, it will not be able to survive. Therefore, it is urgent to first seek to unite and consolidate the group for the purpose of defending against external forces. The purpose of setting up a new group is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>However, this policy of the House of Peers is not the best policy. Today, for the sake of the House of Peers, the only way is to painfully reform itself, cut its own power, and accept politicization in order to slightly cater to the trend, so that it can seek self-preservation. If it insists on the long-standing rejection of politicization and stubbornly resists the new trend with established ideas as a wonderful plan for self-consolidation, then it will become more and more divergent, and its propositions will also be greatly mistaken. However, the House of Peers today has not yet realized this.</p>

<h3>London Naval Conference Faces Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>French Proposal Makes it Difficult for Britain and America</p>
<p>Newspapers Mostly Criticize the Proposals</p>
<p>Ford Adds Another Profitable Business</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - In the past two days, the British, American, and French representatives have discussed the French memorandum. These talks will resume on Tuesday evening after the French Prime Minister returns from Paris. Today's newspapers criticize the French proposals, with many critical comments, questioning the flexibility of the French figures and proposals. It is undeniable that the French proposals make it difficult for Britain and America. However, the participants remain optimistic. It is heard that French Prime Minister Tardieu initially expected the naval conference to conclude by March 10 and a treaty to be signed. The French memorandum stated that war between Britain, France, and the United States is an unexpected event, but it did not mention Japan and Italy, causing some misunderstanding. This misunderstanding has now been cleared up, as it is understood that the memorandum only criticizes the suggestions and figures already issued by Britain and the United States. Associated Press, New York, 15th - Today's editorial in the New York Chronicle Tribune discussed the development of the naval conference, believing that there is hope for agreement in the proposals of both France and Japan, as the French proposal is quite flexible, and Japan, if its request for 70% of the US strength fails, may not necessarily reject other matters as well. Now France does not want to be only a strong European power, and regards the security of its Asian colonies as an important naval responsibility. Its requests should easily gain the sympathy and understanding of other countries, as there are unstable situations in India, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, and various countries share the same concerns as France.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Ford Mar, 15th - Automobile magnate Mr. Ford told an interviewer from the Associated Press today that he could draft a condition under which to purchase the warships involved in the London naval negotiations. He can utilize the world's navies in a general demolition program, by completely dismantling the entire ship and re-equipping it to become automobiles and agricultural machinery. However, he dared not say that this method could end the war. Mr. Ford said that merely removing weapons cannot end war. The only way to stop war is to guide those who profit from war to realize that what can be gained by other means can be seen as more abundant than what is gained by war. Mr. Ford also said that his waterway factory had purchased ships from the US Navigation Department a few years ago and dismantled them to make machines. Based on his experience, it is a profitable business to convert weapons into agricultural implements.</p>
<h3>Spanish Old Parliament Dissolved</h3>
<p>City and Provincial Councils Simultaneously Restored</p>
<p>Disturbances Continue in Various Places</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 16th - The King of Spain has dissolved the parliament that was formerly a puppet of Rivera and Dictatorship.

<h3>New Group Formed in Japanese House of Peers</h3>
<p>To Prevent the Intrusion of Politicization</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th - The plan for members of the House of Peers with titles to organize a new group has now been concretized. Duke Konoe and four others from the Kayo-kai, Count Matsudaira and five others from the Kenkyukai, and Baron Sakatani and Baron Suwa from the Koseikai are the initiators. The first meeting will be held on the 21st at the Kazoku Kaikan to decide on the name of the group, regulations, etc. The establishment of this group is for the purpose of fulfilling the original mission of the House of Peers. The members with titles will adopt a non-partisan attitude and serve as an organ for exchanging opinions. When problems arise in the future, opinions will be exchanged within this group at any time to determine the attitude of the House of Peers. Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - Recently, within each faction of the House of Peers, in order to avoid the politicization of the House, there was a proposal to organize a new group encompassing all members with titles. Since this new group is not a political group, when any problem erupts, opinions will be exchanged at any time, and each faction will determine its attitude to attend the new group meeting, preventing political brokers from taking advantage. Recently, the members selected by Imperial Edict have been criticized for politicization, so the establishment of a new group at this time has considerable significance.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Persecution of Religion</h3>
<p>Officials Vigorously Deny It</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 16th - The official news agency stated that Russian newspapers have investigated the leaders of the Russian Church in Moscow, and based on the reports obtained, Soviet Russia has never persecuted religion. Although some churches have been closed, it was at the request of the people. Although some believers have been arrested and exiled abroad, the reason was their anti-government behavior, not their religion. Religious ceremonies are still allowed, but believers are not very enthusiastic. People can study religious studies when they reach a certain age. Under Soviet Russian law, all religions have equal rights. Church leaders also said that the rapid development of atheism is indeed a concern for us, and the position of the church is becoming increasingly worse, but we hope that religion can eventually be revived. Church leaders pointed to the Pope's article asking Christians around the world to pray to God for Russia on March 19 as a behavior that deviates from the true path of Christianity, and strongly condemned the Archbishop of Canterbury's accusation that Russia hates religion, saying that his words are bizarre and instigate people to interfere.</p>

<h3>Japanese Election Battle Intensifies</h3>
<p>Hamaguchi Attacked the Opposition Party Unscathed</p>
<p>Inukai Ridiculed Hamaguchi for Not Understanding Politics</p>
<p>Dentsu News, Tokyo, 16th - With more than half of the third stage completed, the general election battle, which is about to heat up, is currently occupied by the government party with some advantages, but whether the government party will occupy a long-term advantage, or the opposition party can recover the decline by hard work, all depends on the struggle in the next four days. The National Comrade Association and the Reform Party, which are between the ruling and opposition parties, and the proletarian parties, are under the pressure of the fierce struggle between the two parties, and are fighting hard in various places. However, there are also some places where the proletarian party is full of enthusiasm and overwhelms the candidates of the two major parties. Confused battle scenes are unfolding everywhere. Victory or defeat cannot be predicted. The powerful candidates at this moment may not necessarily win, and those who have an advantage at this moment should not be pessimistic. The final fate depends on the struggle in the next few days, so the wonderful taste of the general election is also in the next few days. Old and young, streets and alleys, all talk about the election, and their執烈 is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Dentsu News, Tokyo, 16th - Prime Minister Hamaguchi attacked the Seiyukai at Hibiya Public Hall, unscathed. President Inukai also delivered a speech at the Fukuoka branch yesterday, refuting Hamaguchi's speech one by one, saying that it is questionable whether Mr. Hamaguchi understands politics, and using his spicy ridicule to refute the important news of the Minseito Party's policies.</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Urges All Countries to Abandon Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>This thing has already ceased to exist</p>
<p>It is better to acknowledge the facts early</p>
<p>Translated by the World News Agency, excerpting from the New Republic Weekly of New York: The National Government in Nanjing has resolutely announced the abolition of foreign extraterritoriality rights in China, effective from January 1st of this year, and declared that its negotiations with the powers are merely a formality. So, how will the governments of all countries, including our own, deal with this? Our State Department has instructed newspapers to state that it will protect the rights of American citizens in China. However, how to protect them is a real problem. Foreign courts in China still exist in various ports, protected by foreign bayonets. However, China will not recognize the existence of these courts. The validity of these court judgments will at least become ambiguous. Materially, the situation between China and foreign countries has not changed. Spiritually, the Nanjing government's prestige has greatly increased because it has successfully challenged the powers. If, in the coming months, the powers abolish their courts in China due to the actions of the National Government, the National Government will have won a major victory. If the courts are not abolished immediately, the National Government, although diminished in foreign relations, will have more solid and enthusiastic support from the domestic public. At the same time, foreigners in the interior areas without foreign troops stationed there are already somewhat subject to the jurisdiction of Chinese courts, and this will be even more so in the future. Moreover, the experience of German and Russian residents under Chinese judicial jurisdiction has not been too inconvenient. As feared by London and Washington, if the issue of abolishing extraterritoriality remains unresolved, there is a great crisis if there are conflicts between self-respecting Chinese officials and violent foreigners, as exemplified by the May Thirtieth Incident. Therefore, the governments of all countries must make a decision quickly. If they can truly maintain the extraterritoriality rights of their people in China, then so be it. Otherwise, they should quickly acknowledge the facts and formally abandon something they no longer enjoy. The American government should especially know that Americans do not want to use force for something like extraterritoriality, especially since they do not understand its definition.</p>

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province's Views on National Land Tax Reform</h3>
<p>Advocating a balanced approach of addressing both symptoms and root causes</p>
<p>Two departments jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in response to the Ministry of Finance's inquiry regarding opinions on national land tax reform, instructed the two departments of finance and civil affairs to deliberate and reply. The Department of Finance, upon receiving the provincial order, immediately sent a letter to the Department of Civil Affairs seeking its opinion. Now, having received the Department of Civil Affairs' reply, they jointly submitted a report to the provincial government, requesting it to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review. It is heard that the result of the two departments' consultation is to advocate a balanced approach of addressing both symptoms and root causes. The reasoning is that taxes come from land, and land tax reform must first clarify the condition of the land. Only then can the problems of taxes not being based on land, and concealment and evasion be eradicated. Taking land survey as the first step in land tax reform is indeed a thorough method, but there is a lack of funds and personnel. Implementing land survey cannot be completed in a few years, and land tax reform is urgently needed. Delaying it will not solve the urgent problem. Therefore, while preparing for land survey, Zhejiang Province is also implementing land declaration as a temporary solution. Once the declaration is completed, the type of land, area in mu, boundaries, value, yield, and owner's name will all be clear. This register can be used as a preliminary step for land tax reform. The two procedures of investigation and valuation can be omitted. At the same time, land survey should still be gradually carried out according to the land consolidation procedure, and the results of the land survey should be used to thoroughly reform. This is truly a balanced approach of addressing both symptoms and root causes. However, the situation in each province is different and cannot be handled uniformly. It is possible to infer from this. During this period of reform in this province, relevant laws and regulations on land law and land tax will also be submitted to the central government for promulgation as soon as possible, so that there will be a basis for implementation and facilitation of progress.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs and Transportation in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence: Since the arrival of the central divisions in Xuzhou, the defense of Xuzhou has been very peaceful. In terms of transportation, the Jinpu Railway has fully resumed operation. However, the passenger cars on the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Bianliang have not yet been connected. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Military News: The Central Government transferred the 1st and 3rd Divisions to Xuzhou. The headquarters of the 3rd Division is located in the old Daoyin's office, and the headquarters of the 1st Division is located in the Zhejiang Guild Hall. The troops are stationed in the western and southern parts of Xuzhou to protect the road and strengthen the defense. Gu Zhutong arrived in Xuzhou on the evening of the 11th and set up the military headquarters in the old Daoyin's office. All military affairs in Xuzhou are presided over by Gu. The military police battalion of the Second Route Army, led by Xiang Kuang, and the independent engineering battalion, led by Pang Guojun, arrived by train from Pu today (14th). It is heard that Liu Zhi will come to Xuzhou to garrison. His divisions will be reviewed in Xuzhou. As for the defense areas of each army, it will be determined after Liu arrives in Xuzhou. The troops stationed in Xuzhou have been taking advantage of their spare time to practice building fortifications, and the defense is extremely solid.</p>
<p>Transportation: The north-south transportation of passenger and freight cars on the Jinpu Railway has fully resumed since the Shi army moved its defense. However, the Jinpu Railway cars seized by the Shi army have not yet been released. According to the railway authorities' investigation, there are 17 locomotives and about 300 cars parked at the station. Jinpu transportation is somewhat affected due to the lack of vehicles. The Longhai West Road previously requisitioned passenger cars for transportation. Now the Ministry of Railways has appointed Qian Zongze as the director of the Longhai Railway Bureau. Qian is temporarily working in Xuzhou due to the blockage of cars and has not been able to go to Zhengzhou to take office. However, since yesterday (13th), the Xuzhou station has resumed westbound passenger cars, but only to Dangshan. The 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division is stationed along the way at Huangkou and Yanglou. A cavalry company of the 1st Division has also recently been sent to Dangshan to garrison to protect the road. As for the passenger cars coming down from Biandong, they only go to Mamuji, where a large part of the Shi army is stationed, arranging defensive fortifications. Therefore, transportation between Dangshan and Mamuji has not yet been connected. The Xuzhou-Dangshan train schedule is recorded as follows: The 3rd train departs from Xuzhou at 9:00 AM and arrives in Dangshan at 12:13 PM. The 4th train departs from Dangshan at 1:00 PM and arrives in Xuzhou at 4:45 PM. As for the eastbound passenger cars, they also travel once a day, but are often delayed. (14th)</p>
<h3>The Breach at Hujiatan on the Yellow River in Shandong Province Expands</h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence: The rise of the Yellow River due to ice thaw and flooding has been recorded in previous letters. According to the River Affairs Bureau's report today, the river water has thawed to Ninghai downstream. Below Ninghai, the ice has not yet thawed. The ice and water from upstream are flowing down together, with nowhere to discharge. It has once again seized the old course of the Hujiatan breach and flowed downstream. The breach had been dry for a long time. Yesterday, six tenths of the water flowed through it. Although the water depth at the breach is only three feet, the breach is very wide. The surrounding areas are all flooded. Many houses have been washed away. In this freezing weather, the disaster victims are all sleeping on the embankment, crying and suffering, which is unbearable to hear. The water in the main stream of the Yellow River had risen more than six feet a few days ago. Yesterday, because water flowed out of the breach at Hujiatan, the water in the main stream dropped by three feet instead. The magnitude of the water flowing through the breach can be imagined. According to the report, the River Affairs Bureau has telegraphed to the downstream sections to pay attention to preventing and protecting houses, and reported to the provincial government, urging the payment of the remaining 30,000 yuan for blocking the breach at Hujiatan, in order to actively block the breach. The breach at Hujiatan has been open for more than a year. 300,000 yuan was spent last summer, but the result was that the breach became larger and larger. Last winter, the breach was completely dry. The estimated cost of blocking the breach was only more than 70,000 yuan, but the Department of Finance only allocated 40,000 yuan, resulting in the loss of opportunity. The dried breach has become a flood again. The River Works Committee is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting at the provincial government on the 15th to discuss river works. The River Affairs Bureau's proposals include urging the issuance of spring dike funds and the remaining funds for blocking the Hujiatan breach, and requesting the formulation of measures for the repair and defense of civil dikes. I am afraid that before the discussion is settled, the people in the Hujiatan breach area will have the trouble of their fish [being eaten - i.e., their livelihood being ruined]. The following is an excerpt from the telegram from Ji Sicheng, the downstream section chief of the River Affairs Bureau, reporting on the ice thaw and flood rise: "Last night, I rushed to the upper section and found that the ice at Tangjia, Lijia Wangzaojia, Yangfangjia, Wangjiaji, and Liujiakou was thawing, damaging more than 40 sections of stubble stone and willow sweep, and pushing away many ice shields. Fortunately, the section chiefs gathered civilians to protect them with all their strength, and there was no accident. The river water has now risen more than six feet, and the ice is still flowing down the river, which is very dangerous. In addition, the telegram from the north sixth Ji section chief downstream said that the ice blocks were squeezed once below Caiyuan, and the water rose three feet. The ice was squeezed again at Xiajia, and the water rose two feet. At noon today, the ice blocks in the Gongjia Sunjia Damajia area began to thaw completely and flowed eastward. Many of the dikes there were damaged, and half of the ice shields were wiped away. The current is now very fierce and has been pushed to Qijiazui. We are now supervising the engineers and gathering civilians to protect them with all our strength."</p>
<h3>Final Resolution of the Qian Ruizhi Case</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui's Reply to the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Stating that there can be no infinite tracing</p>
<p>Jinan correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Women's Association, because the woman Qian Ruizhi lost the property dispute with her brother Ruitong, petitioned the Provincial Rectification Committee to forward it to the Central Government, requesting the Judicial Yuan to re-review the Supreme Court's interpretation of the case (because the Shandong High Court based its judgment on the Supreme Court's interpretation of the case). The President of the Judicial Yuan, Wang Chonghui, has now replied to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee with a very detailed explanation of the statute of limitations for a woman's right of inheritance. The Qian Ruizhi case should now be finally resolved. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "Respectfully replying, I received your office's letter of the 7th of this month, opening with: The Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee reported that the Provincial Women's Association Rectification Committee petitioned to re-review the Supreme Court's interpretation that unmarried women whose parents died early cannot enjoy the right to inherit property. The Standing Committee approved the reply. A copy of the original petition is attached. The right of a woman to inherit property began with the resolution of the women's movement at the Second National Congress. Therefore, for anyone who has a son and dies before the effective date of that resolution, the time of death is the time when inheritance begins, and at the same time the property is inherited by the son, and the daughter does not participate. This is because the law at that time stipulated that only men could inherit property, not women. After that resolution became effective, although it was recognized that women also have the right to inherit property, the effect of tracing back was not discussed. Because for any inheritance that has been determined according to law, the subject of the property has already changed. If everything is overturned, the tracing can be extended infinitely, and the disputes will be countless. The Shandong Provincial Rectification Committee, according to the Provincial Women's Association Rectification Committee, stated that the effect of that resolution extends to the inheritance of property that was determined before its effective date. This is a misunderstanding. The phrase "re-analysis" in the detailed rules for the implementation of tracing inheritance of property by married women, cited in the presentation, is also inconsistent. The detailed rules were because the Supreme Court mistakenly believed in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that only unmarried women had the right to inherit property according to that resolution, and not married women. With this misunderstanding, it is inevitable that there will be errors and omissions, and the property that married women should inherit will be directly analyzed by other heirs. Therefore, the detailed rules stipulate that it is possible to request a re-analysis, as a remedy for those who have been deprived of the right to inherit property due to misunderstanding. In fact, the right to request a re-analysis is still based on the right to inherit property, and the right to inherit property is still only for property that began to be inherited after the effective date of that resolution. The Central Political Conference's resolution on the new interpretation of women's right to inherit property clarifies the starting date for women to inherit property in Article 1, which is the intention. The Supreme Court's reply to the Shandong High Court on November 19 last year reviewed the Supreme Court's interpretation and was based on these resolutions and detailed rules. According to the above points, there is nothing inappropriate. The original interpretation is copied and sent to your office for review and presentation. To the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, Wang Chonghui, Q."</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Rectifies Northeast River Defense</h3>
<p>Northeast Allocates 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Salvage of Sunk Ships Begins</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Conference on Navigation Issues</p>
<p>Harbin Communication on the 12th: Shen Honglie, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Navy, arrived in Harbin from Liaoning on the 8th of this month. On the morning of the 8th, he attended the graduation ceremony of the Northeast Merchant Ship School's driving class, and inspected the shipyard and inspected the Lisui warship. The Lisui was damaged in the Battle of Sanjiangkou on November 12 last year, and was transported back to Harbin. After being supervised and repaired by the shipyard, all the ship's hull, deck, gun positions, and engine room were renovated. It cost 50,000 yuan. It has recently been completed and is scheduled to return to the Jiangkou area after the river ice melts. On the 9th at noon, Shen convened naval officers of the river defense to plan the river defense after the opening of the river, and personally comforted Yin Zuyin, the commander of the river defense fleet, and returned his resignation, ordering him to continue to do his job as usual. That is, he ordered Gao Yongnian, the chief mate of the Navigation Bureau, and Zhang Jianwen, a naval captain, to take more than 100 employees to Tongjiang Fujin to excavate the sunken Jiangheng, Lichuan, Lijie, Jiangtai, Jiangping, Jiang'an and other six ships, as well as the Zhonghua and Fujiang paddle steamers, while it is still frozen. They will be transported back to Harbin after the river opens and put into the dock for repair. Shen stated to the navy fleet personnel that the Northeast budget of 400,000 yuan is to restore the river defense navy, and stipulated that all damaged ships must be repaired by the end of June this year. Before the river opens in April to mid-June, the Lisui, Jiangqing, Jiangtong, and Jiangji will be used to maintain the river defense. Except for a part of the naval service personnel who will return to Qingdao for training first, the rest will return to their ships to serve.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, the Navigation Bureau held a board meeting to discuss the navigation plan after the opening of the river this year. Shen attended as the chairman of the board. There were many proposals, and no decision was made at that time. It was decided to continue the discussion next Monday. However, regarding the seven ships Yixing, Haicheng, Xiantong, Aihui, and Tongshan detained by the Russian side, it has been decided to request the authorities to submit them to the Sino-Russian conference and demand that the Russian side return them. On the 11th, Shen went to the East Railway Bureau to visit the two directors, Li Shaogeng and Shen Ruilin, to discuss the issue of Northeast inland river navigation rights, and instructed the Chinese directors to pay attention to avoid the Russian side raising the issue of Sino-Russian navigation rights. It is heard that the Russian side has recently adopted the suggestion of the former Russian director of the Navigation Department of the East Railway Bureau and plans to raise three navigation-related issues at the Sino-Russian conference: (1) In accordance with the practice of the powers sailing warships and merchant ships on the Yangtze River, requesting Russian warships and merchant ships to sail on the Songhua River; (2) Requesting the Northeast to return the nine merchant ships of the East Railway that were confiscated in the 16th year of the Republic of China, to be operated by the East Railway itself; (3) China and Russia exchange the three navigation lines of the Songhua River, Heilongjiang River, and Wusuli River, and formulate international navigation regulations. Shen also sent his proposed opinions to Mo Dehui, who attended the Sino-Russian conference, as information for future discussions.</p>
<h3>Communist Organization Cracked Down in Jingdezhen</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication on the 11th: Jingdezhen is a famous porcelain industrial city in our country, with more than 100,000 workers. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party tried to make this town red. Fortunately, after the separation of the Communists, the workers were able to realize this, so there was no trouble. However, since then, the Communist Party's secret work in this area has not ended. Zhang Huihuan, the commander of the 18th Division, recently learned from the confession of a Communist Party member named Zhang that "Huang Chaojin and Guang Rong and others secretly organized a Communist Party machine in Jingzhen, hoping to riot," and so on. After obtaining the confession, Commander Zhang specially sent Committee Member Peng and others secretly to Jingzhen, and convened the magistrate of Fuliang County, Magistrate Li, the company commander of the 104th Regiment's mortar company, Company Commander He, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Director Jiang, and the captains of the Jingwei team, Captains Li and Yu, for an emergency meeting. The security was very tight. After discussion, at 4:00 that evening, military police were sent to Daijia, Nanmentou, Saibotianli and other places in the town to arrest 25 Communist Party members including Huang Chaojin and Guang Rong, as well as many important documents, and Huang and others were sent to the province for processing that day. Also, in the northeastern corner of Jiangxi Province, between Yiyang and Dexing, because the mountains are rugged and the area is vast, and the Mopan Mountain between Yiyang and Hengfeng is inaccessible, Fang Zhimin was able to carry out red work here. The provincial government has decided to establish a county here for the sake of ruling and to eliminate the danger of becoming red. Now, it is heard that the provincial government intends to establish two more counties in Jinggang Mountain between Ninggang and Yongxin and Donggu in Ji'an (Donggu is the bandit den of Li Shaojiu and Duan Yuequan), so that they can be specifically responsible for maintaining local security and preventing becoming red.</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Reply to the Non-Collection of Surcharge for Late Payment: The County Party Department previously inquired about whether the surcharges for the land tax and surcharge for late payment due to busy waterway transportation would be increased at the same time. The Director of the Finance Bureau, Wang Zhuofu, replied that the surcharge for busy waterway transportation does not increase the price. At the beginning of the establishment of this bureau, it was announced to the public and ordered to comply. However, although the land tax does not increase the price, the guarantor or the owner must pay the regular and surcharges together when paying, so as to avoid unevenness and allow cunning people to take advantage of it. The letter is hereby replied, and it is hoped that it will be forwarded.</p>
<p>Convening of River Works Audit Committee: The Economic and Engineering Review Committee of the Nanqiao Pond River Works was previously decided to be organized by the county government meeting, and local gentry recommended by various bureaus were presented to the county for appointment, including Ruan Zhiheng, Diao Yebai, and other seven people.

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>News of the Dissolution of the Bandit Gangs: The Water Public Security District learned of the confirmed news of the dissolution of the bandit gangs. Zheng Han's gang from Henan has mostly fled to Xiaofeng County in Zhejiang Province, and a part has returned to Changxing to cultivate tenant fields as before, no longer being bandits. (1) Zhong Shimu's gang from Chaohu has returned to Langxi, Anhui Province. (1) Mao Zilong's gang from Haizhou has fled to the outer sea with weapons. Mao himself is hiding in Shanghai and has been taken into custody for investigation. The reason why these bandits are so numerous is that, firstly, the bandits of the Big Sword Society and mutineers have joined, and secondly, because the fields in Henan are barren, many people who went out to cultivate tenant fields have become bandits.</p>
<p>Telegraphing the Situation of the Bandit Forces in Wujiang: Fei Shuwei and others from Wujiang in Suzhou jointly telegraphed Chairman Jiang, stating that the situation in Wujiang is important. The bandit forces in Wujiang are rampant, and their cannons and guns are sophisticated. The Jiangsu and Zhejiang water police have launched suppression campaigns, but have been unsuccessful. Captain Li Guobin was killed in battle, and District Chief Xu Pucheng was seriously injured. Rifles and cannons were robbed. The Zhejiang Provincial Defense Army has temporarily retreated. The Zhejiang Provincial Defense Army is weak. Wujiang is an important point in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If Wujiang is in danger, Suzhou will be in danger. The bandits occupy Taihu as roaming bandits, which is related to the overall situation in the southeast and is a concern for the government. We urgently request that capable troops be sent to Jiangdu to suppress them. Urgent appeal from the Wujiang gentry and people in Suzhou, Fei Weishu, Jin Tianpian, and others, respectfully, in the year of Xinyou.</p>

Ordering the investigation of the French people being robbed in Suzhou, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday (26th) telegraphed the Wuxian County Government, saying that the French Embassy had reported that on February 2nd, four French people were traveling near Suzhou by boat, and all their belongings were robbed by bandits. Please investigate and report the details so that a decision can be made. The three villages have been repeatedly harassed by lake bandits. Xianglu Changlu, Huanhe, and Xishu have been repeatedly harassed by lake bandits in the past few days. After the bandits landed, they occupied the people's houses and forced the men and women of the households to serve them like slaves and cook for them, while ransacking the houses from top to bottom.

<h3>### Lehua Unfortunate Defeat Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two to Three, Weissider Wins</p>
<p>Lehua Football Team, known as a star in the Shanghai football scene, lost to Weissider yesterday with a score of 2 to 3. All those who were present at the Yiyuan Stadium felt deeply saddened. During the ninety-minute game, both sides were evenly matched and equally strong. However, due to the injury of the internal defender, Feng Yunyou, the team's internal and external strengths were affected. As a result, the team that had victory within its grasp lost the battle. How unfortunate for Lehua.</p>
<p>Chen Yutian, the right winger of Lehua, was the only dangerous figure among the forwards at the time. He could run, dribble, had good ideas, and was agile, creating many opportunities. It was a pity that his teammates did not make good use of them, resulting in limited success. Lehua's two goals were indirectly due to his well-placed passes. Li Huitang was versatile and served as the central defender yesterday, performing well. If Feng were on the field, he would have been positioned as the left inside forward, and with Chen Yutian's support, he could have scored at least two or three more goals and maintained his long-standing reputation for victory. Weissider's forwards' shooting skills were also quite ordinary. Their strengths lie in the balanced strength between the internal and external players, coupled with their great physique and strong physical strength. Their victory was not entirely due to luck.</p>
<p>According to an official announcement by the Westerners' Association, the previous day was the Senior Cup match, and yesterday was the Group A match. Suddenly, the two teams agreed to interchange. Therefore, in the results of the two-day competition, Lehua achieved a draw in the Group A match, while yesterday's Senior Cup match resulted in a loss of opportunity to advance and win the championship.</p>

<p>Stanley Nohr Seizes the Pass, Referee Donner Silver Hears the Start, Weissider Kicks off to attack. Lehua Uses the Wind Power, and Goes Down Like a Rush. The Enemy Faces the Sun, The Line of Sight Flashes, and The Lehua Army Gains the Deepest Reaches. The Defense of The Enemies is Solid, So The Ball is Forced Back Fiercely. Before Lehua's Gate, It is Greatly Shocked, Chen Zhenhe Stands Back Beside the Gate, and Cooperates With Zhou, to Go Away. Unexpectedly, The Second Attack is Before The Eyes Again, and The Right Wing Stephen Fiercely Shoots The Ball, Zhou Holds It With Both Hands, The Center Forward Snoke Rushes Zhou and Falls To The Ground, Fortunately, He Can Throw It Out In Time, Left Winger Standford Gets The Chance to Re-Sandwich, and Succeeded In Seizing The Pass With Four Horses.</p>

<p>Chen Jiaqiu's Footwork Was Limited, Both Sides Were Tied, The Battle Was More Intense, Chen Yutian Kicked a Corner That Was Excellent, Once When The Center Defender Li Huitang Took The Opportunity To Join The Front Line Unawares, Suddenly One Foot, If It Was Not A Few Inches Higher, Another Goal Would Have Been Added, Weissider Also Repeatedly Attacked, Hitting The Goal Several Times, But Because Lehua's Defense Was Tight, It Repeatedly Advanced and Retreated, In The Last Two Minutes, Chen Yutian Had Another Amazing Pass, The Goalkeeper and The Forward Collided With Each Other, and Fell to The Ground Together, The Ball Went Out Not Far Away, Chen Jiaqiu Rushed From Behind, With Eyes Under His Feet, He Shot Out to The Empty Place Where The Crowd Was, Niguer Pounced On The Ground To Stop It, One Step Late,</p>
<p>But I Saw A Ball Rolling Away, and Disappearing Into The Net, and Lehua Took The Lead With Two To One, and The First Half Ended Soon.</p>
<p>Weissider Found a Way to Survive, In the Second Half of The Battle, Weissider's Territory Was Mostly Controlled By Lehua, Occasional Counterattacks Were Nothing More Than Boring Shots, Chen Yutian Had Changed to An Inner Forward, and Cooperated With Dai, Which Was Very Exciting, All the Way The Momentum Was Like Breaking Bamboo, Almost Near The Gate, Chen Lifted His Foot to Attack, The Goalkeeper Was Prepared Early, Was Blocked Out Into A Corner, and Retreated Ineffectively, Chen Zhenhe Made A Comeback, Deep Into the Border, He Picked The Ball in The Center, Xi Qiaosheng Made a Fake Kick, and The Ball Shot to The Right Corner of the Gate, Inner Guard Bourke Tried His Best to Head It, and Weissider Found a Way to Survive.</p>
<p>Snoke's Goalkeeping Was Effective, After Surviving A Disaster, There Must Be Future Happiness, Weissider's Military Appearance Gradually Became Stronger, and The Performance Was Amazing, At That Time, It Happened That The Lehua Players Were Tired, So They Were Able to Attack As Much As Possible Without Leaving Any Strength, Within Five Minutes, Snoke and Osmon Each Scored a Goal, Reversing the Lead with Three to Two, Lehua Reversed The Victory Into Defeat, The Ambition Was Still There, Chen Jiaqiu Passed The Ball to The Left, Chen Yutian Had Transferred From Right to Left, Taking Advantage of The Momentum, He Drove Forward Quickly, For a Moment, He Was About to Take His Foot Back, When He Was Seized By The Goalkeeper Snoke, Weissider Was Able to Maintain The Victory, Which Was Due To The Goalkeeper Snoke's Contribution, As a Result, Weissider Defeated Lehua with Three to Two, and Won The Senior Final.</p>

<h3>### My Reflections After This Zonal Competition (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Li Huitang</p>
<p>After being separated from us for almost three weeks, the grand chiming clock standing on the roof of the Customs House welcomed us back to Shanghai again the day before yesterday afternoon. This zonal competition of ours, including the voyage, took a total of nineteen days. In this very short period, we have accomplished a lot of things, traveled a lot of journeys, and there are many valuable and worthy things that we should mention again. Therefore, I have this first reflection written out. The East China region failed in this zonal competition. I will put aside the reasons for the failure for now. However, in this failure, I experienced a special sense of joy. This is because our trip to the South this time was purely represented by Lehua. It is well known that Lehua dominates Shanghai. This time, we were defeated by the South in Hong Kong. Brothers, that can prove that the football talents of our Chinese people are everywhere, and that the foreigners residing in our country know that the strength of our Chinese people in the football world is something they should respect. There are many other events that happened, but due to the length, I cannot record them all in a diary style. I can only simply select the important ones and write my thoughts below. Regarding the reception aspect, regarding the reception aspect of the zonal competition, based on my experience in the three zones of North, South, and East China, I can definitely say that South China is the most appropriate, enthusiastic, and sincere. This time, we truly felt the joy of being at home in the South. In addition to the Hong Kong Football Association specially selecting a reception committee to receive us and taking us to visit the provinces of Guangdong and Macau, there were also groups such as the South China Athletic Association, Jingwu Athletic Association, Chinese Athletic Association, Taikoo Club, Chinese Recreation Club, Chinese Swimming Association, Fujian Athletic Association, Guangzhou Hsieh Chin Association, and Lingnan University School, as well as private wine and tea parties held by philanthropists such as Sir Ho Tung, Yu Shirong, Luo Wenwei, Ho Shi, and Liu Bowei. It was truly impossible to attend to everyone and everything. In addition, the Queen's Theatre and the Lee Theatre invited us to watch movies, which is also something we should be grateful for. Some people say that the Hong Kong Football Association treated you to this extent this time, but it was only because the two draws resulted in a higher income than expected. I think this person's words must have been meant in a humorous way.</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of affairs, all the staff for this zonal competition were specially appointed by the Hong Kong Football Association. Everything was in order and well-organized, which is truly worthy of our admiration. In particular, Mr. Huang Jinying, the director of reception, was able to sacrifice his time and business to stay with our team day and night, acting as our old horse. His spirit and kindness made us feel extremely grateful. In short, the achievements of the other party in handling affairs this time can be considered excellent. Although there were times when things were not taken care of, such as the use of old balls in the second match, those were just minor flaws.</p>
<p>Regarding this competition, although we experienced two draws and ultimately failed, we cannot judge heroes solely on success or failure. I dare say that my failure this time was a failure on luck, not an artistic failure. Although there are many national players in the East China team individually, when it comes to cooperation, passing, and stamina, everyone agrees that we are relatively superior. Although we lost the championship, like the Westerners say, "Defeated But Not Disgraced," we did not lose face. We were unable to maintain our certain victory in the last three minutes of the first and second matches, which can be said to be due to luck. In the second match, due to the fatigue of the whole team and the near-fracture of Comrade Xianyan's ribs, it was difficult to persevere, so we had no choice but to taste the bitterness of defeat. However, although we have returned to this place, the image of our artistry has not been lost. Our return together will be forever imprinted in the minds of the people of Hong Kong, and they will no longer dare to underestimate us. No wonder people in Hong Kong with a longer vision say that East China's football is relatively advanced, and can be said to be progressing rapidly. From this point of view, the past prestige of the South China team will probably soon reach East China. See you next time. To be continued.</p>

<h3>New Year Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Ma Erqian</p>
<p>At Tao Lou's spring banquet, all the literary figures were present. Mr. Zhu Guwei was also in attendance. During the drinking, Mr. Zhu suddenly presented a note, saying, "A short letter. How would you gentlemen like to appreciate it?" Upon examination, it was a threatening letter written in pencil, roughly stating that the army's pay was lacking. Hearing that Mr. Zhu made a living selling his calligraphy and was doing quite well, they requested a gift of ten thousand gold. Otherwise, they would use other means to deal with him. The guests looked at each other and laughed. A certain elder statesman stood up to congratulate Mr. Zhu, saying, "Sir, you are a talented man. Selling your calligraphy to support yourself is already a hardship. Now you have both talent and wealth. People will treat you like a god. From now on, you no longer need to write letters to beg for rice." He then composed two quatrains on the spot as a gift, saying, "A talented man transforms into a god of wealth, No longer need to worry about poverty. Could it be that under your aging wrist, The blossoming brush tip yields gold and silver? Counting on talent and fame to support his livelihood, The calligrapher is celebrated on the sea. Worried about having no letters to beg for rice, Relying on him to chatter like Cao Qiu."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu smiled and said, "This old man of seventy-four has been out of touch with the world for a long time. I didn't expect these fellows to still be so kind to me, showering me with a short letter. My path is not lonely." The whole gathering smiled.</p>
<p>On Yu Yunxiu's fiftieth birthday, Hong Weng collected Tao Yuanming's lines to make a couplet as a gift, saying, "Relax the belt and enjoy the pleasure, Joyfully spend the mornings and evenings. Hold a pot to welcome guests, Always have a pleasant countenance." The wording was very appropriate. Xia Zhongyi saw it and laughed, saying, "The first line is a lewd woman flaunting her charms, and the second line is a beautiful prostitute welcoming customers." The whole gathering burst into laughter. It reminded me of a line by my deceased friend Ying Jun in his youth, saying, "Purple grape trellis overlooks the mirror in the morning, Red peony lanterns ascend the building at night." Ying was quite proud of the delicacy and sharpness of his writing style. Someone said, "The first line is a demon fox showing its shape, and the second line is a female ghost causing trouble. It can be put together with Weng's couplet to provide amusement."</p>
<h3>Clever Monkey Demonstrates Skills</h3>
<p>— Fang Fei</p>
<p>I once saw a monkey sharpening a pencil in a movie, and its movements were extremely nimble. This time in Beijing, a friend introduced me to Mr. Cheng, with whom I played chess. During the conversation, we touched upon the theory of human evolution. Mr. Cheng said that among the beasts, monkeys are the closest to humans in nature. My friend also mentioned that Mr. Cheng kept a monkey, which was very clever. I made an appointment to visit his humble abode to see its skills. When I arrived, I found that his house was next to my maternal grandmother's house, which I often passed by. Mr. Cheng was very hospitable. Soon, he brought out a monkey from behind the house. It was as small as a one-year-old baby, and its eyes were bright and not at all afraid of people. Mr. Cheng took a stubby pencil and a small knife from his desk and gave it to the monkey. The monkey tried to sharpen it, but it couldn't make a point after a long time. Suddenly, it threw it on the ground and jumped out. We all laughed. Mr. Cheng chased it back and pretended to be angry. The monkey sat trembling beside him, looking very pitiful. Mr. Cheng then took a porcelain basin and placed a towel inside, ordering it to wash. The monkey seemed not to understand. Mr. Cheng shouted loudly and demonstrated himself. The monkey then reached into the basin and washed it repeatedly, looking just like a laundress experienced in washing clothes. I praised its cleverness. Mr. Cheng seemed quite pleased. He then scolded the monkey, "Umbrella!" The monkey ran to the back room and dragged out an umbrella. Mr. Cheng said, "Open it!" The monkey slowly fumbled for the mechanism, trying to open it, but it was too weak to bear the weight. It fell to the ground and closed again, and it trembled and sat close to Mr. Cheng's feet, as if begging for mercy. Mr. Cheng smiled and stroked it with his hand, and it finally looked relieved and went away. I asked Mr. Cheng about the origin of this monkey. He said that his father bought it from a villager at the foot of Huangshan Mountain during a trip. This villager made a living by capturing and selling monkeys. Ordinary monkeys were only sold for four or five yuan, but this one was priced at twenty yuan. At that time, it could already perform ordinary and simple little games. After buying it and training it, it became even more intelligent. At the same time, he also bought a female monkey, which could understand human language and could also pick up and serve small objects. However, because its body was more slender, the children were very afraid of it. Moreover, because it was female, it had periods like women. The family disliked it and gave it away. The recipient did not restrain it well. One night, it broke its rope and escaped. Since then, the nearby area was often disturbed by it. In the end, it was shot and killed with a hunting gun. Mr. Cheng also said that when the little monkey first arrived, it was not afraid of people but was extremely afraid of dogs. Mr. Cheng's house originally had a guard dog, which was very kind to the monkey and often sniffed it, but the monkey screamed and ran away in a panic. Mr. Cheng then sent away the dog and kept the monkey, because Mr. Cheng regarded the monkey as no less than a baby in swaddling clothes and was afraid of not taking good enough care of it.</p>
<h3>Fengdu</h3>
<p>— Yu An</p>
<p>People traditionally regard Fengdu as the realm of ghosts, and, along with Yanzhou in Shandong, it is a terrifying place in the minds of the world. It is not only women who believe it, but in the past, scholars and intellectuals were also unable to break this kind of superstition, saying that it is better to believe it exists than to believe it does not. In fact, Fengdu is just an ordinary county town. Fang Xiangying's "Diary of an Envoy to Sichuan" says, "The county has the Xiantu Guan and Magu Cave, which are said to be the residence of the True Monarch of the Purple Mansion. It is unknown when the Senluo Hall was created. It was later associated with Lord Ge's cave, thinking that it was the Fengdu of Hell. This is just the deception of the world by Taoist priests, losing its true meaning." Furthermore, Fan Chengda's "Record of Lake Boats" says, "Fengdu County in the Central Plains is three miles away from Pingdu Mountain. According to the inscriptions on the stone tablets, Wang Fangping of the Former Han Dynasty and Yin Changsheng of the Later Han Dynasty both attained immortality here. There is the Danlu of Lord Yin. The Yin Jun of Fengdu is Yin Changsheng. The common people mistakenly believe that he is the master of the underworld. Therefore, they believe that Fengdu is the residence of the ghost chief, which is very absurd." Fengdu used to belong to Zhongzhou. Hence, it is said. After the founding of the Republic of China, it was changed to belong to the Dongchuan Road. Furthermore, Fengdu was originally named Fengdu, which was established by Yang Sui. It was not until the Ming Dynasty that Feng was changed to Feng. The association with the realm of the underworld is not known from what time in the Ming Dynasty. Recently, I met a Mr. Wu in a certain hotel. We exchanged names and places of residence, and it turned out that he was a native of Fengdu County. Therefore, I asked him if there were any strange occurrences. He said no, it was just a rumor. However, the local people are also extremely superstitious, saying that after six o'clock in the afternoon, ghosts come to market. Each shop places a basin of water at the door. Anyone who comes to buy something must place money in the water. If it sinks, it is a person. If it floats, it is a ghost. However, no one has ever seen it float. It is just a tradition passed down by the elders. In this age of scientific enlightenment, there are also those who know that it is wrong and break it. Furthermore, on the birthday of the City God in that area, they carry the idol out on patrol, which is called "going out to the meeting," in order to predict a good harvest. If they do not go out to the meeting, the wind and rain will definitely fall in a timely manner. Therefore, it is held once a year. During the parade, the palanquin cannot be stopped arbitrarily. There is a fixed point. Otherwise, if the palanquin stops at the door of someone's house midway, that person will be unlucky and will become ill and die, which is very effective. This is not unique to Fengdu. It is the same everywhere. For example, in my Wuling, there is this kind of superstition. The City God's palanquin is most afraid of stopping in front of people's houses. Mr. Wu also said that if you want to talk about strange occurrences, it would only be the Liusha Slope. The Liusha Slope is formed by the accumulation of quicksand. There is a huge pit below. The sand flows from below to above, year after year, without stopping. However, the sand on the slope does not seem to increase, and the sand below the slope does not seem to decrease. Therefore, all kinds of absurd stories have arisen. However, it has nothing to do with the realm of ghosts. In short, whether there are ghosts or not is still undecided. Fengdu is actually an ordinary county town, with nothing strange about it. In the past, traveling was difficult, and people from other provinces rarely visited. As a result, false information was passed on. Now, transportation is very easy. If there is any doubt, it is best to go there and see for yourself. Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times. I know that this kind of superstition will be completely broken within thirty years.</p>

<h3>A Record of Watching Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>After dinner on the Lantern Festival evening, I strolled along the East Street of Xuhui. I encountered my friend Mr. Lu and his fiancée. They invited me to their nearby residence to see the lanterns. There were hundreds of lanterns, arranged in the shape of a long pillar, commonly known as a pagoda lantern. Although the candlelight was dim, it was still quite a spectacle. When the fun was over, I bid farewell to Mr. Lu to return home. Mr. Lu insisted that I stay for a little chat. He told me, "Since I left my family to study, my expenses have been considerable, and I owe a great deal of money. The demands for repayment are urgent, and I am very uneasy. I beg you to lend me a hundred gold pieces to relieve my immediate need. Once the family funds arrive, I will immediately return them to you." I declined because I had no money to spare. He politely pleaded for about half an hour, but my purse was empty, and I was powerless to help. Mr. Lu then left in a dejected mood. Mr. Lu comes from a well-to-do family. His father gives him six hundred gold pieces each year for his studies. He always has leftover money and has bought enough books to fill a room. He constantly regards himself as a scholar. Now, because of a love affair, he has actually stooped to begging for help. It is truly pitiable! I hastily record this to warn myself.</p>
<p>Red Carpet</p>
<h3>A Record of Watching Xun Huisheng Perform the Play "Burying Fragrance, An Illusion"</h3>
<p>— Lao Zhuo</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, I watched Lian Sheng's newly staged play "Burying Fragrance, An Illusion." Huisheng plays Zhang Yingying, doing needlework in the embroidery building with the matchmaker, Aunt Bird. Liu Qianzhong happens to pass by her building, glances at her, and smiles, thus planting the seeds of love. Later, Yingying becomes ill while her mother is praying at the temple, and she is harassed by the ruffian Wu Er. In haste, she rushes out the door, intending to escape to Aunt Bird's house, but mistakenly enters Wu's house. This is an illusion of Wu and Bird being homophones. She escapes from Wu's house and unexpectedly runs into Qianzhong, who sends her home. Along the way, they express their love for each other, and they become engaged. This is an illusion of love. Liu's father is drunk all day. Hearing rumors, he does not investigate carefully and directly goes to the door to force the cancellation of the engagement. This is an illusion of the pedantic scholar. Yingying feels ashamed and swallows jade, fainting. Her mother loves her deeply and gives her a proper burial. Wu Yunzi and the bird matchmaker Aunt Bird both put on ghost makeup and go to steal the coffin (the coffin theft scene is done in the dark to avoid offending the audience, which is very thoughtful). They suddenly encounter each other and are shocked and fall down. Wu awakens, and Aunt Bird dies. This is an illusion of playing ghosts. When the coffin is opened, Wu takes the jade from the girl's mouth, and the girl celebrates her rebirth. She rushes to Qianzhong's house. Qianzhong is shocked, thinking it is a ghost, and strikes her to the ground. Then he recognizes her, and the father and son abandon their home and flee, an illusion of fearing ghosts. Aunt Bird happens to be the village head, guarding the girl's corpse. The girl revives again and sneaks into Qianzhong's bedroom, dressing as a man to move about, an illusion of confusion and uncertainty. Bird suspects the corpse has changed and chases after it with a stick, accidentally killing Wu, yet another illusion of sacrificing a plum tree for a peach tree. The entire plot is based on fantasy; everything is an illusion, showing much thought and is quite enlightening. And Lian Sheng's spirit and manner in this play are perfectly suited to the clever and beautiful young lady. After disguising herself, she meets Liu's father and pretends to be cordial to plot the re-establishment of their marital alliance, often coercing him with words. This section shows extraordinary verbal dexterity, and the appearance is also very similar to a handsome man. On the way, she encounters Qianzhong, and in the section "Save my remaining life, express my chastity," the "I" character revolves around four or five beats, falling into the "chastity" character. The singing is very good, as if to say that a woman's chastity cannot be ignored, and it is specially and solemnly presented, making the meaning particularly clear. "The court is like rushing water (fainting, entering the coffin, being almost violated by Wu Er who stole the tomb)." Such a long sentence seems difficult to arrange, but the singer is able to display the ability to catch and emphasize the beats, smoothly and freely. The overall cast of the play is also very well-organized. The performance only lasts for two hours, without being protracted or verbose, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (130)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: At the Luxurious Feast, Delicate Birds Sing and Flowers Bloom; In the Golden House Completed, Good Birds Choose the Right Tree</p>
<p>It is well known that the brothels of Shanghai are all gathered in the Fuzhou Road area. This is their territory. The remaining so-called "wild chicken" prostitutes are scattered in all directions, the lower-class ones around Hujiazhai, and the higher-class ones around Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>Most of the higher-class ones are those who "play mahjong and set up tables." In the past, foreign-style equipment was not as popular as it is now. The highest-class rooms had rosewood furniture, called rosewood rooms. The same could be used to host dinners and entertain guests, but not in the formal style of the licensed brothels. Therefore, later, when people elected the Flower Queen President, they compared the alleyways of the licensed brothels to the various provinces, such as Qinghefang, Yingchunfang, Xiaohuayuan, etc., each with a governor. And those not in the Fourth Avenue area, such as Guizhou Road, were called special areas. I will now talk about No. 2 Guizhou Road, which is at the turn of Nanjing Road. There was a "wild chicken" brothel there, which was the highest class. A new girl had just arrived. When she first came, people didn't pay much attention to her because she didn't go out much, unlike the lower-class "chicken" prostitutes who had to go to teahouses every day to attract customers. That place was for a few familiar people to go in, play mahjong, and smoke. It was called "playing mahjong and setting up tables," also known as "living at home." Because of the arrival of this new character, everyone said she was beautiful. Originally, her door was as deserted as a river, but in an instant, it became as bustling as a market. A friend who often came to the Mingjing Club mentioned No. 2 Guizhou Road, saying that there was such a person there, and that her face was simply unmatched in the Shanghai brothels. It was a pity that she had fallen into a "wild chicken" brothel. Truly, "there is no fragrant grass anywhere in the world," and "in a village of ten households, there must be honest and trustworthy people." That gentleman was also a bookworm, and he shook his head and sighed for a while. Immediately, everyone was moved by him, and their curiosity stirred up thoughts of seeking beauty and exploring charms. They agreed that Guizhou Road was not far away, and that they would go to investigate on the spot. At that time, four or five people volunteered, including Yan Yichen and Zheng Yanxiu. After the report from those who went to Guizhou Road, everyone said that the name was not in vain. Among the "wild chicken" brothels, you couldn't find a second person like her. She was the queen of the "wild chickens." Thus, the words "Wild Chicken Queen," said by you and me, spread her name. In fact, her name was Su Jun. Coincidentally, at that time, a hero had also risen in the No. 2 brothel, named Wen Suxiang. Everyone called her the No. 2 Queen. Lan Sun called her the "Yaowang." Thus, there were two queens in the same era, one was the Yaowang Wen Suxiang, and the other was the Wild Chicken Queen Su Jun. "Where is the feminine wind of this queen now?" But at the beginning, she shocked the world for a time. This Zheng Yanxiu felt that many prostitutes were mediocre and unworthy of mention, but he was extremely impressed by the Wild Chicken Queen, willing to prostrate himself as a subject. Although some people said that the name "Wild Chicken Queen" was not elegant, he said that Empress Lü Zhi was still a queen, so what was there to say?</p>

<h3>Gold Price Exceeds 90 Taels</h3>

Trading among members was fairly active. However, there were no transactions for March as usual, and most were changed to April. The opening price was 486 taels, 5 mace, 5 candareens, with a minimum price of 86 taels, 1 mace, and a maximum price of 89 taels, 1 mace. The closing price at noon was 89 taels, an increase of 5 taels, 1 mace compared to the day before yesterday. This was based on the April listed price. As for the carry trade, it initially ranged from 1 tael to 8 or 9 mace, then 9 mace and a half, peaking at 1 tael, 3 or 4 mace, then reverting to 1 tael, 2 mace, all quoted by long positions, because the April price was higher. The gold bar market continued to show strength, exceeding the 490 tael mark. Buying was more enthusiastic, and sentiment was good, as the market rose amidst the carry trade. However, there was a difference of 3 taels between them. Firms such as Yongchengchang, Yuanchengyong, Zhifengyong, and Yiyu all bought in, while Hengxing, Taixing, and Shengda sold out. The market opened high from the start, probably because large positions were being reduced. Sellers seemed more active afterward, and the market was slightly downward. Finally, buyers swarmed in, and the price was raised again by a few taels. As of yesterday, London silver bars had decreased by 3/16, and the silver price had also fallen by 3/8. Exchange rates were unchanged, and the market was sluggish. Increased by 5 Taels and Zero Points - The opening price for April gold bars was 487 taels, 5 mace, then increased by 5 candareens, then decreased by about 2 taels, to 827 taels, 1 mace.

When retail investors sold off at 10:30 AM, it fell to 87 taels, 6 or 7 mace. After this, Yuanchengyong, Yuanxingyong, Yongshengchang, and others all chased in, and the market suddenly became stronger, rising sharply, increasing by over 2 taels. At 11:20 AM, it reached 90 taels, 2 candareens. At this time, the Cantonese group took the opportunity to sell, and it suddenly decreased by about 2 taels. At 11:45 AM, it was 89 taels, 2 or 3 candareens. A few minutes later, it immediately turned higher by 1 tael, returning to 90 taels, 3 candareens. The price only fluctuated by 2 or 3 candareens up and down. At the noon closing, it was 490 taels, 2 candareens, and the market showed signs of potential rise. Approximately, compared to the day before yesterday (excluding 1 tael), it was still up by 5 taels, so there was a ledger entry on Sunday. Both this month and April are 490 taels, and February is 89 taels.</p>
<p>More Members Took Long Positions - It is noted that the highest price for April in the previous market was 90 taels, 3 candareens, and the lowest price was 87 taels.

As for the transactions of various firms, Hengxing, Shengda, Taixing, Tongtaichang, and retail investors all sold out. Chengfengyong, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Yongchengchang, and Yiyu all took long positions. Yuanmaoyong, Yichang, and Dadecheng were quite active in and out of the market.

<p>The Market Fluctuated Up and Down Last Week - It is also noted that during this week, the market slightly changed, seeming to be in a state of fluctuation. On Tuesday, it reached 490 taels, 6 candareens, then reversed. On Friday, it suddenly fell to 77 taels, 8 mace. Afterward, it rose again, breaking through the 80 tael mark. During these seven days (of March), there was a fluctuation of about 13 taels.</p>
<h3>British and American Silver Prices Sharply Decline</h3>

<h3>Securities - Last Week the Bond Market Fell More Than It Rose</h3>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai bond market situation, from Monday to Thursday, only had two trading sessions in the morning. For the two days of the weekend, the afternoon sessions only began to open. Looking at the daily market trading situation, spot trading was extremely light, with total transactions of 38,000 yuan. Except for the 7-year 96 bond, which had no market, the others were only around 6,000 or 7,000 yuan. The futures market was far better than the previous week. Except for Monday, when only 2.5 million was opened, which was relatively light, trading was quite active on the remaining days. For example, Tuesday totaled 4 million yuan, Wednesday totaled over 5.3 million yuan, Thursday and the weekend each totaled over 6 million yuan, and Friday was the busiest, reaching approximately 7.7 million yuan. The total for the week was 32.275 million yuan, exceeding the previous week by over 20 million yuan. Of this, customs bonds were the largest, with 2.305 million yuan for the February contract and 6.225 million yuan for the March contract. Rehabilitation bonds had 2.15 million yuan for the February contract and 4.515 million yuan for the March contract. Continued bonds had 2.195 million yuan for the February contract and 4.16 million yuan for the March contract. Continued 25 bonds had 1.51 million yuan for the February contract and 2.675 million yuan for the March contract. The Reorganization 6% bonds had 1.625 million yuan for the February contract and 2.45 million yuan for the March contract.

Financial bonds were the lightest, with only 110,000 yuan traded in the entire week for the February contract. The changes in the prices of various bonds were slightly larger than the previous week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, due to rumors of changes in the political situation, the market was weak and selling was strong, and prices fell, some by 5 or 6 cents to over 1 yuan. On Tuesday, spot customs bonds and continued bonds both fell by more than 1 yuan. 7-year and Reorganization 6% current-month futures also fell by several yuan. Although the others were also weak, they only fell by around 4 or 5 cents. On Thursday and Friday, the political situation was chaotic, and market sentiment was hesitant. Except for continued bonds, which fell by more than 1 yuan on Friday, the others showed mixed gains and losses. Although they all fell on the weekend, the trend was still peaceful. As a result, customs bonds had the largest decrease compared to the previous week, falling by several yuan. The others also fell by 1.5 yuan to 1.78 yuan. Only the 96 bonds fell by only a small fraction of a yuan. Financial bonds showed slightly more strength. Looking at the bond market situation, it still seems weak. A statistical list of the high, low, and rise/fall of various bond prices over the past week is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn - World Raw Cotton Supply and Demand is Increasing Year by Year</h3>
<p>The production and consumption of raw cotton worldwide are increasing year by year, based on historical statistics. Looking at the following tables, we should know that although American cotton production holds the leading position in the world, other types of cotton production are also increasing daily and are gradually gaining a strong position. Before the British Great War, annual consumption of American cotton was 3,667,000 bales, and consumption of other types of cotton was 778,000 bales. However, in 1929, consumption of American cotton was only 48% of the pre-war level, while consumption of other types of cotton was 131%.</p>
<p>(1) World Cotton Supply</p>
<p>Regarding the supply of cotton production, the rate of increase in world cotton production since 1920 has been significant. From 1860 to 1900, the trend of the cotton production growth rate was roughly 2%. After 1920, it was probably more than this. 1929 was especially remarkable. In 1929, the supply of raw cotton increased by 12 million bales compared to 1900, and also increased by 3.5 million bales compared to the pre-war year of 1913. The average of every five years of world total raw cotton production since 1900 is listed below for comparison (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>(1) World Total Raw Cotton Production</p>
<p>Year | American Cotton | Indian Cotton | Egyptian Cotton | Russian Cotton | Chinese Cotton | Other | Total</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>1900 | 9,922 | 2,285 | 1,224 | 388 | 1,060 | 675 | 15,524</p>
<p>1905 | 10,801 | 2,657 | 1,240 | 488 | 969 | 794 | 16,929</p>
<p>1910 | 11,847 | 3,257 | 1,300 | 740 | 1,922 | 974 | 20,040</p>
<p>1915 | 14,176 | 3,471 | 1,358 | 1,056 | 2,482 | 1,129 | 22,672</p>

<p>1928 | 54,919 | 5,400 | 1,583 | 1,325 | 1,500 | 2,772 | 27,500</p>
<p>(Note) The numbers from 1900 to 1928 are the average numbers for every five years. The last two years, 1928 and 1929, are the numbers for one year.</p>
<p>(2) World Raw Cotton Consumption</p>
<p>The increase in world cotton consumption is also very significant. European consumption decreased after the war due to the adoption of a 48-hour work week, as shown by the numbers from 1919 to 1925 in the table below. Consumption in Asian countries with a silver standard increased, but has also slightly decreased in recent years. It is expected that consumption in Japan may decrease again this year after the lifting of the gold embargo. The improvement of cotton consumption around the world in the last 50 years is listed below to show this. The numbers are also averages of five years, with units in thousands of bales.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Commercial and Public Utilities Supervision Issues</h3>
<p>Submitted by the National Government to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>
<p>On January 15th of this year, the Shanghai Special Municipality, along with the Hankou and Nanjing Special Municipalities, jointly submitted a request to the National Government and the Executive Yuan regarding Article 3 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities, which does not explicitly provide for special municipalities. Furthermore, the "Regulations on the Supervision and Punishment Rules for Commercially Operated Enterprises in Shanghai" have been ordered to be abolished, and all previously established contracts have lost their basis. They requested instructions on how to remedy this situation and submitted a joint report. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government received Instruction No. 517 from the Executive Yuan, stating: In order to implement the instructions, it has been investigated that the Municipal Government, together with the Hankou and Nanjing Special Municipalities, jointly reported that</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Article 3 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities does not explicitly provide for special municipalities, and the "Rules for the Supervision and Punishment Rules for Commercially Operated Public Utilities in Shanghai" have been ordered to be abolished, and all previously established contracts have lost their basis. They requested instructions on how to remedy this situation. The National Government transferred this case to the Yuan for handling. The Legislative Yuan has deemed the aforementioned supervision rules previously submitted by the Municipal Government as inapplicable. At this time, there is no need to discuss it. As for the claim that Article 3 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities does not explicitly provide for special municipalities, it should be submitted to the National Government and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for review before further instructions are issued, etc., instructing the Municipal Government to be informed and to report back to each case. Now, a letter from the Secretariat of the National Government's Office of Civil Affairs has been approved, stating: "Respectfully, the Chairman has issued your Yuan's report to the Shanghai, Hankou, and Nanjing Special Municipalities, which jointly stated that Article 3 of the Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities does not explicitly provide for special municipalities, etc., which is indeed the case. It is proposed to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review in order to issue instructions. As for the case that the 'Rules for the Supervision of Commercially Operated Public Utilities in Shanghai' have been ordered to be abolished and should not be discussed, it has been ordered to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, etc." It is appropriate to send a letter to the Municipal Government to be informed and to forward it to the Hankou and Nanjing Special Municipalities to be informed. This order is issued.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Apprehending Bandits and Thieves</p>
<p>Announced by the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners reside together, and petty thieves are rampant. Recently, cases of banditry and kidnapping have been repeatedly seen. The reason for this is that although society is bad, the dereliction of duty in arrest is also undeniable. Therefore, the "Regulations on Rewards and Punishments for Patrol Officers and Police in Apprehending Bandits and Thieves" have been drafted as the basis for rectifying arrest duties. Instructions have been issued to all district offices to comply. The attached regulations are as follows: Article 1: These reward and punishment regulations are specifically formulated for the purpose of organizing the arrest of bandits and thieves in each district office of this Bureau, and they shall apply to all patrol officers and police in each district office.

<p>]P&lt;The Request of the Seven Counties of the Old Song Prefecture to Investigate Charitable Property Was Not Approved</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Executive Committee had previously been repeatedly urged by the County Executive Committees of the six counties of the Old Song Prefecture to convene a discussion meeting to advocate the investigation of the charitable property of the seven counties. It has already been submitted to the Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee and forwarded to the Central Government to achieve the goal. Now, a letter from the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee has been received, stating briefly: "According to the report of the County Executive Committee, requesting the reorganization of the Seven County Charitable Property Committee, etc., after Chen Feng's Standing Committee approved the opening, 'still follow the previous order and handle it by the administrative authorities, no need for the party department to stipulate,' etc." It is appropriate to send a letter to inform you and must also inform, etc. However, the Shanghai County Executive Committee is currently rushing to complete the conclusion, and it is estimated that this case must wait until the party department has completed the reorganization before it can be resolved.</p>

<p>]P&lt;Ancient Relics from Henan Will Be Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>Public Exhibition</p>
<p>Sales to Aid Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Zhang Fangyun of the Henan Disaster Relief Association said to the Shanghai-based Henan people: "Mr. Ruan Xiaoqiao at No. 525, Sanduo Lane, Jiaozhou Road, Shanghai, Mr. Wang Wenfu, Mr. Duan Houfu, Mr. Shen Shaoyi, and Mr. Ren Taoyu of the Special Municipality Public Security Bureau all know that Henan Province has suffered from consecutive years of disasters and famine, and deaths have followed one after another. At this time of spring growth and food shortage, the situation is extremely critical, and bandits and soldiers are everywhere, making relief difficult. Our association is heavily burdened and short of funds, and we are at a loss. Now, in the face of impending death, in order to save one in ten thousand, we plan to transport to Shanghai the three-generation tripods, Yi, Song and Ming pottery, Kunyu strange stones, Dengfeng jade, Tang and Song calligraphy and paintings, inscriptions from the Sui and Tang Dynasties and earlier, and various rubbings from cliff carvings collected by the public and private sectors in Henan. We will hold an exhibition and sell tickets, and all proceeds will be used for disaster relief. We are organizing and preparing to go to Shanghai on a regular basis. However, this matter is of great importance and depends on the wisdom of the group. We humbly ask you for three things: (1) Contact the newspapers and publish various promotional documents on our behalf, which will be regarded as donations from the newspapers to disaster relief; (2) Find a suitable location for the exhibition; (3) Ask various charities for assistance. We have always believed that you care about your hometown and have a broad desire to benefit the people. We hope that you will agree with this initiative. Please reply by telegram on how to proceed. Sincerely, Zhang Fang of the Henan Disaster Relief Association, winter."</p>

<p>The Wife of the Deceased Helmsman, Ms. Xu Lin, Presents a Document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Regarding the British Ship Collision Case</p>
<p>Requesting That Negotiations Be Launched to Compensate for the Bereavement</p>
<p>According to the DAHUA News Agency, the Guangfu ship of the British Merchant Laisiyang Firm collided with Xu Qiaoqing, a stone barge helmsman, in the middle of the Huangpu River on December 2 of last year, and the barge sank. Negotiations have been conducted repeatedly, but no solution has been reached. It is now learned that Xu Lin, the wife of the deceased, filed a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government yesterday, requesting that negotiations be conducted based on reason, because her husband died in an accident. The original report is excerpted as follows: "My husband, Xu Qiaoqing, was 37 years old and a native of Dinghai, Zhejiang. He has been a stone barge helmsman for many years and has considerable experience in sailing. The wages he earns each month are sufficient to support the family. On November 30 of last year, he was entrusted by the cargo owner Shi Lanji of Songjiang to load 40 tons of stones and sailed to Shanghai. At 7:00 a.m. on December 2, when sailing past the Yitaixing South Wharf in the Huangpu River, he needed to change direction to sail forward due to the headwind. Just as he was about to change direction to sail towards the Puxi side, the Guangfu ship, flying the British flag, suddenly sailed head-on. In an attempt to avoid the bamboo rafts in the middle of the river, he did not expect to turn the bow too far, causing it to collide violently with the barge steered by my husband, breaking it into two sections. The barge flooded and capsized, and my husband, along with the four people on board and 40 tons of stones, fell into the Huangpu River. Except for the four people who were rescued by nearby rowing boats, my husband was not found alone. It was not until after 9:00 a.m. that he floated up again and was recovered by the boat, but he had been dead for a long time. He was then sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in the South City for an autopsy and reported to the Shanghai Local Court to appoint Prosecutor Zhu to come to the site to verify that three ribs in the chest were broken by the impact. He then filled out the corpse form and determined that he had died from injuries sustained before death, and ordered the family to collect the body. I then learned that my husband had three ribs broken by the impact, and he was seriously injured, which caused him to sink to the bottom of the Huangpu River after falling into the river, and only floated up after a while. However, because I was unable to afford a coffin, Xin Yuangong, the executive director of the Sand and Gravel Barge Workers Union, took pity on me and raised funds for me to arrange a hasty funeral. At that time, I heard the news and was heartbroken. I then thought that my husband was killed by the ship, and the responsibility lay with the ship. Moreover, my husband died tragically in an accident, and who would support the family? I then hired Lawyer Da Yaoxian to negotiate with the Guangfu Shipowner Laisiyang Firm, demanding compensation for the loss of my husband's life and condolences to the family. Unexpectedly, the Westerners of the firm initially shirked responsibility, then denied any responsibility for the accident, and claimed that the barge collided with the ship and refused to compensate. Finally, they claimed that the family did not hire a lawyer to negotiate, and they could provide condolences on humanitarian grounds. Now that a lawyer has been hired, they will negotiate as much as possible, so they refuse to provide condolences. Although representatives of the Municipal Party Committee and the General Labor Union went to the firm to negotiate based on reason, it was also ineffective. It is clear that the Guangfu ship injured and killed someone, but they shirk responsibility and refuse to compensate and provide condolences. I am afraid that if this precedent is set, if our Chinese boatmen are killed by foreign ships, it will be impossible to negotiate compensation and provide condolences. The fact that my husband was killed and the negotiations were ineffective is a small matter, but in the future, all Chinese boatmen will be discouraged. My husband left behind one son and two daughters, who are all young and unable to support themselves. This month, I gave birth to another son. Since my husband's tragic death, the family's livelihood has been unsustainable. Although the labor unions donated funds to provide relief at the end of last year, it was temporary. In the future, the livelihood will be precarious and the children will be crying for food. In order to protect the lives of Chinese boatmen and to maintain the livelihood of my family, negotiations should be conducted to achieve compensation and condolences in order to value life and maintain livelihood. I am specially reporting the situation and requesting your department to review and approve it, and to promptly lodge a serious protest with the British Consulate in Shanghai, ordering the Laisiyang Firm to compensate for the loss of my husband's life and to provide condolences for the future livelihood of my family. As for the loss of the stone barge and cargo that was hit, the boatman Wang Aqi will submit a truthful report separately and negotiate it together. I am submitting a document detailing the tragic death of my husband and the reasons for the negotiations, and I beg you to grant your approval and promptly conduct negotiations, which will be fair to both the living and the dead."</p>
<p>The Transportation Industry Requests a Reduction in Walnut Shipping Fees</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Road Transportation Association sent a letter to the Traffic Manager yesterday, stating: "Recently, the transportation companies have reported that all walnuts shipped by merchants are classified as fourth-class goods according to your road's regulations, which has been the case for many years. Now, according to the freight classification table formulated by the Ministry of Railways, walnuts are not included, only nuts are listed, which are calculated as second-class goods. Although walnuts can be mixed with nuts, they are different from longan and lychee nuts. The price difference is very large, so it is difficult to compare them. Why should the freight rate be increased so drastically? This is an obstacle to freight transportation. Therefore, we request that the Traffic Manager approve the continued handling of the regulations in order to facilitate transportation and alleviate the difficulties of merchants, which will be fair."</p>
<p>The Registration Deadline for Cooked Water and Doufu Industries Has Been Extended</p>
<p>Extended to the end of this month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau received a letter from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "It is hereby informed that the registration rules for the cooked water and doufu industries in this city have been announced successively. Most of those who have complied with the order to register are in the majority, but there are also quite a few who are following the trend and delaying the application. If strict measures are not taken, the laws and taxes will be affected. We have repeatedly requested your bureau to instruct the district offices to notify the industries to comply and to register with the bureau by the end of December of the 18th year. We are deeply afraid that the merchants of the industries are ignorant and do not know the laws and regulations. We have extended the deadline for another two months. All those who have not yet obtained a business license are required to register with the bureau by the end of February of this year. If they still refuse to comply, they will be punished separately in accordance with the rules. In addition to issuing orders to the municipal commissioners of each district to notify the industries to comply with the regulations, we are sending a letter to inform you and hope that you will instruct the district offices to notify the industries to comply with the regulations."</p>
<p>]P&lt;Li Xingrong's Lung Hospital in Germany</p>
<p>Director of Li Xingrong's Lung Hospital</p>
<p>After graduating from the Keio University Medical School in Japan, Dr. Li Xingrong went to the University of Berlin in Germany to specialize in lung diseases and bacteriology. He made many discoveries and obtained a doctoral degree.

The two hospitals can accommodate more than 1,000 to 3,000 patients. Dr. Li believes that many Chinese people suffer from lung diseases, so he has done in-depth research on lung diseases and has extensive experience. He published many papers in Europe and was highly respected by scholars there. Now that he has come to Shanghai, he has been hired by the Shanghai Lung Sanatorium at No. 2 Daxi Road in this city. He and Dr. Gu Yuqi, a German doctor, are the directors of the hospital at the same time. It is heard that important treatises on lung diseases will be published soon, which is good news for those suffering from lung diseases.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Relief Preparations of the Lianyi Charity Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lianyi Charity Association has recently seen disaster victims from Henan, Shaanxi, and other provinces flocking to Shanghai. Various charities have set up relief efforts, so the association has repeatedly sent people to investigate. Disaster victims have gathered in places such as the Taiyang Temple in Zhabei, the Fahua Temple in West Shanghai, the Xinyingpan at the South Railway Station, and Pudong. Each batch has as many as 600 or 700 people, and as few as 100 or 200 people. They are without clothes and food, which is very pitiful. Relief has been distributed in batches, and it has been more than two weeks since it began. There are still countless people who have arrived later. Now, because there are many disaster victims and they are crowded, it is not easy for the relief workers to distinguish them without holding flags. Therefore, flags have been made specifically for relief purposes. In addition to submitting a report to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, we have also requested that the Public Security Bureau be instructed to notify the district offices that if the association is providing relief in their jurisdiction, they should send police to suppress it in order to emphasize good deeds.</p>

<p>Vegetable and Ground Goods Industry: The Shanghai Special Municipality Vegetable and Ground Goods Industry Association held its first regular meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 40 people attended, including Chen Shushen, Chen Yunsun, Cai Xiaolou, and Zhang Degui. Xia Wenlan, the standing committee member, was elected as the chairman. The meeting was held as usual. After reporting on the documents from various agencies, the following cases were discussed: (1) The Finance Bureau increased the donation tax and changed the quarterly donation to a monthly donation. It was generally said that the vegetable industry is declining and the situation is like hard labor. The donation tax has already been paid to the Finance Department and the seasonal donation to the Finance Bureau. The first class is 20 yuan per quarter, the second class is 15 yuan, and the third class is 10 yuan, which is already a struggle, but they are unable to bear it, so some people have stopped their business. Now, if it is changed to a monthly donation, although it is divided into four classes, the first class is 30 yuan, the second class is 20 yuan, the third class is 10 yuan, and the fourth class is 5 yuan, which is about five times more than the quarterly donation, and it exceeds the donation tax of other industries.

<h3>Foodstuffs: The Rice Market Suddenly Turns Dull and Sluggish</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, about twenty boats from various groups arrived. Due to the continuous price increases, the market sales turned dull and sluggish. Rice merchants in the north were unwilling to lower their prices, and buyers would not purchase unless at a discount, so the overall market saw a slight drop of around a few cents. The price of thin rice remained stable. As the arrival of goods was not brisk, the sales also became quiet. The situation followed the trend of imported rice and showed sluggishness. The top-grade Yangxian rice had already reached sixteen yuan and eight or nine cents, so the buying sentiment turned depressed. Although the demand for Duzi Xian rice was continuous, the price was very high, so transactions tended to be normal. The sales of rice from other ports were completely affected by the imported rice and were sluggish. Therefore, the market prices of all kinds of Xian rice showed slight fatigue. As before, in terms of appearance and quality, a discount of half a cent was required to clear the stagnant stock. The price reduction was half a cent for ordinary grades.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: About ten boats arrived from the river. The sales were brisk for top-grade Changxi Jiying rice, which was in short supply in the market, while secondary goods were dull and traded little. Prices did not seem easy to lower. As the North Shanghai market tended to weaken for Sutong Baijing rice, buyers wanted to lower the price to purchase, but the buying intention of this street was very strong, so the overall price was stable. Secondary goods were slightly soft. Early rice such as Nanbang Jinlufeng and thin rice such as Qingjiao suddenly showed weakness. Moreover, these goods were originally in small quantities, so the market price became even weaker. However, sellers pushed for sales, making it difficult to force a price reduction. Only a slight discount was given. Not much green Saigon large and small broken rice was traded yesterday. Various stores enthusiastically purchased over 15,000 bags of various spot and forward goods, so street sales were invisibly quiet. Prices barely maintained the original level, and the spot price remained unfavorable.</p>
<h3>Soybeans Tend to Stabilize Due to Active Factory Purchases</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the spot soybean market showed briskness. As oil factories in the interior and in this port actively purchased, the market turned stable. Although the arrival of goods from Dalian was not large recently, the buying sentiment was not quiet because the price was still reasonable. The trend of Yangtze River soybeans stabilized. A total of twenty-five cars of average-grade Dalian Yuan soybeans and Changchun soybeans were opened throughout the day, reaching over 10,000 bags. The price was 5 taels, 3 mace, 3-4 fen. 105 bags of newly arrived Hankou Qing soybeans were opened at 5 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen. Other transactions included over two hundred bags of Zha soybeans and Jiu Dong soybeans, which were imported by the Xiaomo gang. The market situation was stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market Soars Last Week</h3>
<p>Overseas demand for spring goods requires raw materials...Factory prices rise another 20 taels.</p>
<p>Japanese merchants repeatedly reduce shipping costs...Over 2,000 pieces of Chinese silk are shipped out.</p>
<p>Last week, the foreign firms' silk market in this port almost soared. Due to the start of spring goods in the European and American markets, various silk and sock factories needed raw materials, and the sales of raw silk increased. The stock of silk was scarce, and the export of Japanese and Italian raw silk decreased. Various silk weaving factories began to purchase Chinese silk. Last week, the overseas silk telegrams to Shanghai were not weak, and European firms actively sought to collect them, especially Shanghai white silk factories. Various manufacturers reduced work and stopped machines one after another because dry cocoons were thin and difficult to adjust. Although European sales are brisk this year, the price of silk has risen because only over thirty silk factories are operating this year, and silk production has decreased. Supply cannot meet demand, and the market sentiment is firm and the price has risen again by 20 taels. Since the new year, there has been a rise of one hundred taels. The source of Sichuan and Shandong yellow silk and Huzhou silk has not been smooth since the New Year, and the price is also firm. A total of over seven hundred packages of spot and forward silk were traded throughout the week. The export of Chinese silk was also strong. Because Japanese merchants competed to transport Chinese silk, they repeatedly reduced shipping costs. Shipping Chinese silk to the United States only costs one U.S. dollar per hundred pounds, so European firms took the opportunity to ship out a total of over two thousand pieces throughout the week. Overseas Chinese silk has consistently risen sharply. The market prices of European and American Chinese silk at the end of last week are listed below (New York price per pound, unit: gold yuan; Lyon price per kilo, unit: franc).</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Silk 5.84 362 Superior Dry Silk 3.52 212</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Test Flight of the "Sea Eagle"</h3>
<p>Shen Deqian Pilots Himself</p>
<p>The largest combat aircraft ordered by the Ministry of the Navy from the Fujian Mawei Arsenal, named "Sea Eagle," has been assembled. It was scheduled to be test-flown on the 16th of this month at the Aircraft Division of the Ministry of the Navy. It is now known that yesterday at 3 p.m., Shen Deqian, Director of the Aviation Department, personally piloted the aircraft from the Naval Aircraft Field and took off into the air. He first test-flew over the Jiangnan area along the river near the Navy Headquarters in Gaochang Temple, circling around until 4 p.m. before returning to the Naval Aircraft Field in Gaochang Temple to land. The results were said to be excellent.</p>
<h3>Recent Second Fleet</h3>
<p>Increased by Twelve Ships</p>
<p>The Second Fleet of the Navy originally had a total of sixteen large and small ships, including the Chu Tong, Chu You, etc. During the Western Expedition last year, ten ships were added by confiscating and改造 (rebuilding/repurposing) merchant vessels. Two ships, such as the Yong Sui and Min Quan, were added by the Jiangnan Shipyard. There are now a total of 28 ships. The Yi Xian is also under construction, so it is not included. The names of the ships are listed below: Chu Tong, Chu You, Chu Tai, Chu Qian, Chu Guan, Jiang Yuan, Jiang Zhen, Jiang Kun, Jiang Xi, Min Quan, Yong Sui, Jian An, (Scrapped Ships) Li Tong, Fu Ding, De Sheng, Wei Sheng, Yi Sheng, (Converted from Merchant Vessels in the Western Expedition) Gong Sheng (Converted from Ping Shou), Cheng Sheng (Converted from Ping Tong), Ren Sheng (Converted from Ping Qiang), Sui Sheng (Originally named Chang An, Converted from Ping Da), Quan Sheng (Converted from Jiang Ping), Yong Sheng, Qing Tian (Converted from Da Sheng), Zheng Sheng (Converted from Ping Feng), Jie Sheng, Shun Sheng (Jiangnan Conversion).</p>

<h3>Foreign Press Discusses Reasons for Silver's Decline</h3>
<p>Excessive Silver Reserves in Shanghai</p>
<p>Unrelated to War and Drought</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the price of silver has recently fallen sharply. The central government is eager to find a way to remedy the situation and has convened representatives from Chinese and foreign chambers of commerce, as well as key figures from the banking and business communities, to meet tomorrow to discuss ways to prevent further declines. According to the 1929 Silver Market Document by Han Tai and Harmond, American silver industry leaders, China imported 136.7 million ounces of pure silver this year, and Hong Kong also imported 16 million ounces for coinage. That is, China imported a total of 152.7 million ounces of silver in 1929, a massive amount. According to Chinese customs reports, China has never imported so much in previous years. In the nine years from 1919 to 1927, the average was only about 60.5 million ounces per year. The amount suddenly more than doubled the year before last, reaching 124 million ounces. Last year, after the sudden increase, it increased by more than one and a half times again, so the accumulation and sluggish sales of silver were inevitable. According to a business magnate, a Westerner once said at the previous Sino-Western joint discussion of this matter that the excessive amount of silver in China was the result of internal conflicts. He believes that this is not entirely true. Even if the silver market is also affected by internal wars, China's political instability has already lasted for fifteen years. Why is it only now affecting the silver market? He believes that the current silver tide is actually caused by the excessive amount of silver reserves, and the reason why Shanghai has so much inventory is that foreign governments are disregarding the principles of supply and demand and sending raw silver into the market as much as possible. If there has been more than double the amount of raw silver pouring into China in the past two years, how can China absorb it all? Therefore, he highly agrees with what Mr. Haines, General Manager of HSBC, said: Although China's wars and droughts have some slight impact on the silver market, they are not the main reasons.</p>
<h3>Increase in Cash Reserves in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Concentrated in Governments and Central Banks</p>
<p>The Highest is the United States at Four Trillion Dollars</p>
<p>The World News Agency reports that after various countries successively restored the gold standard after the war, international competition was fierce due to the acquisition of cash. As of the end of September last year, the cash reserves of various governments and central banks were surveyed as follows (converted into US dollars according to the exchange rate parity) (unit: million gold dollars):</p>
<p>1929 1927 1913</p>
<p>End of September End of Year End of Year</p>
<p>United States 4,008 3,977 1,290</p>
<p>United Kingdom 648 724 170</p>
<p>France 1,343 954 679</p>
<p>Japan 541 542 65</p>
<p>Germany 527 444 279</p>
<p>Italy 272 239 265</p>
<p>Spain 495 502 92</p>
<p>Argentina 507 529 256</p>
<p>Netherlands 178 161 61</p>
<p>Brazil 151 101 53</p>
<p>Belgium 142 100 59</p>
<p>India 128 119 124</p>
<p>Russia 142 97 787</p>
<p>Switzerland 103 200 33</p>
<p>Canada 77 152 117</p>
<p>Australia 126 105 22</p>
<p>In the table above, for 1929, the end of September is the end of August for Argentina and Brazil, and the end of October for Russia.</p>
<p>According to the table on the right, the gold reserves of various countries have significantly increased compared to before the war. The reason for this is that the circulation of gold coins among the people was banned legally or de facto, taking the war as a turning point, and most of it was concentrated in the government and central banks. The United States holds as much as 4,008 million yuan, accounting for a strong 41% of the total gold reserves of all countries.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order to Investigate and Report Postal Losses During Russian Military Invasion</h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation yesterday, stating that during the recent invasion by Russian troops, the losses suffered by our country's post offices at various times should be statistically compiled in detail and submitted for transmittal to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation and compensation. This order was to be followed.</p>
<h3>Case of Recovering Territorial Waters, Pilotage, and Navigation Rights</h3>
<p>Ministry of the Navy Reviews and Responds</p>
<p>Four Ministries Still Awaiting Discussion and Reply</p>
<p>The Chinese Pilots Association and the Chinese Yangtze River Pilots Association previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to recover territorial waters, pilotage rights, and navigation rights simultaneously. The Executive Yuan instructed the relevant ministries—Finance, Transportation, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Commerce, and Navy—to handle the matter, as it concerned the recovery of navigation and territorial rights. The Navy has now submitted its response, stating that pilotage services belong to the nationals of the location, and countries in the East and West have established this as law. Public law scholars also recognize this as the exclusive business of the landowner, and people from other countries should absolutely not be allowed to engage in it. Our country's permission for foreigners to engage in this is unique in the international community. The management of pilotage at various trading ports is under the jurisdiction of the Customs, based on the Provisional Pilotage Regulations of the seventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, which were drafted by Robert Hart, the former Inspector General of Customs. The Ministry reviewed the submission from the Inspector General to the Qing Dynasty's Zongli Yamen on the tenth day of the ninth month of the seventh year of Tongzhi, stating that from the thirtieth day of the fifth month of the sixth year of Tongzhi to the eleventh day of the fifth month of the seventh year of Tongzhi, there were a total of 203 pilots at various ports, including 103 Chinese, 40 British, 35 Americans, 10 Germans, 6 Danes, 2 Dutch, and 1 Austrian. At that time, the number of Chinese pilots was more than half. Over time, the situation has changed greatly. Shanghai and Tianjin are busy trading ports. Today, there are about 70 pilots in these two ports, and only three or four are Chinese. This is contrary to the provision in Article 2 of the regulations that Chinese and foreigners should be equally eligible to serve as pilots. If China is at war, there will be no Chinese pilots to hire at various ports, and there is no way to stop foreign pilots from guiding enemy ships. The Sino-French War provides evidence of this. This is the malpractice of foreign customs officials managing pilotage at various ports. The Associations petitioned to order the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Inspector General not to use pretexts to protect foreigners, thus cutting off the livelihood of Chinese pilots. There is some basis to what they say. Customs management of pilotage has already become a case of the guest usurping the host's role and has become the target of criticism by the people. It seems that customs management should be transferred to rectify the authority. The recovery of navigation rights and pilotage services are interrelated. The Associations propose to submit the matter to the State Council and abolish pilotage rights and navigation rights simultaneously, and to determine that only citizens of the Republic of China are allowed to serve as pilots in China's seaports and inland waterways. This is a well-reasoned proposal and should be approved to uphold sovereignty. The Executive Yuan stated that as this case has already been distributed to the relevant ministries for review, the various points raised by the Navy should be jointly reviewed by the Ministries of Finance, Transportation, Foreign Affairs, Industry and Commerce, and Navy for handling.</p>
<h3>Tracks of Contemporary People</h3>

<p>French Consul Ke Gelin and Brazilian Consul-General Tai Si also travelled to Beijing last night at 11 pm on the Jinghu railway night train.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Petition Representative Ye Huijun Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ye Huijun, Chairman of the Jiangsu-Ningshu Municipal and County Rice Industry Association, convened various rice industry groups to discuss relief measures due to soaring rice prices and public concern over food. They publicly requested Chairman Ye to go to Beijing to petition the government to reduce taxes. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his public service. Fellow rice industry members went to the association to inquire, and Chairman Ye reported on the petition in Beijing, saying that he had received sympathy from the government for the difficulties of merchants and was allowed to order each county to investigate the harvest and then re-examine it next year. There has been considerable progress in this matter. He asked his colleagues to wait quietly.</p>
<h3>National Goods Promotion Conference Adjourned Yesterday, Postponed to Another Date</h3>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Executive Committee, in order to promote the expansion of the national goods movement, originally decided to convene a national goods movement conference for representatives of the entire city's population at the Henan Road Chamber of Commerce at 1 p.m. yesterday. However, because the pre-arranged economic experts, Ma Yinchu and others, were unable to attend to give speeches, the representatives present unanimously advocated postponing the meeting to another date, and convening more representatives from national goods factories to discuss specific methods of promoting national goods, which would be more practical. Therefore, yesterday's conference was adjourned. It is said that the Municipal Propaganda Department plans to re-invite representatives from national goods factories to a discussion meeting at a later date. It is expected that there will be a precise and enthusiastic discussion at that time.</p>
<h3>National Goods Promotion Association Representatives Go to Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>To Participate in National Goods Propaganda Week</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, upon being summoned by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department and the County Party Department, is organizing a Zhenjiang National Exhibition, scheduled to hold a National Goods Propaganda Week from the 7th to the 22nd to precede the exhibition. The association has designated representatives Fang Jiange, Pan Dechun, and Mou Yueqiu, carrying exquisite national goods samples, to travel to Zhenjiang by express train at 3 p.m. today to participate in the propaganda and coordinate the exhibition.</p>
<h3>Joint Association of National Goods Factories Soliciting Products for the Qingdao Commodity Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association sent a letter to various factories yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have just received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Commodity Exhibition Hall, stating that the Qingdao Special City Social Affairs Bureau has written to inquire, stating that the Qingdao Commodity Exhibition Hall, formerly reported to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has been reorganized into a National Goods Exhibition Hall in accordance with regulations, and a committee has been established to prepare for the opening of the hall. The municipal government has telegraphed various provincial, municipal, and county governments and chambers of commerce to solicit products.</p>
<p>"Now that the opening of the hall is imminent, all kinds of products should be quickly collected. We have long known that Shanghai's industry and commerce are prosperous, leading the country, and its excellent products are sold at home and abroad. We have specially appointed Ye Xue, Section Chief of the First Section of our Bureau, to go to Shanghai to solicit products, in order to expedite the effort. However, as Section Chief Ye is visiting Shanghai for the first time and is unfamiliar with the people and the place, we are concerned that he may not know how to proceed. We have long admired your hall's leadership in industry and commerce, its ability to gather and distribute, and its enthusiastic and tireless promotion of national goods. We ask that you provide guidance to enable him to know how to proceed, and we hope that your hall will take the lead in consulting with the Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association, the Mechanized National Goods Factories Joint Association, the China National Goods Maintenance Association, the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, and other national goods-related organizations to provide guidance and introduce solicitations to facilitate the exhibition. The Qingdao National Goods Exhibition Hall would be grateful, and the future of Chinese national goods would be fortunate. This letter is sent to you for your information and action.</p>
<p>"Having received this approval, we have determined that the main purpose of the exhibition hall is to revitalize industry and promote national goods. We have long known that your association leads the merchants and promotes national goods with great enthusiasm. We ask that you do your best to help and inform the national goods manufacturers to select new and unique samples and send them to our office for compilation and forwarding to the exhibition. We are sending thirty copies each of the solicitation rules and product description forms and hope that you will distribute them to the various manufacturers.</p>
<p>"Therefore, this letter is sent to you, and one copy each of the solicitation rules and product description forms are enclosed. We hope that your factory will review them and send the new and unique samples directly to the Commodity Exhibition Hall on North Henan Road for compilation and forwarding as soon as possible." This is addressed to all factories, from the Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association, February 17th.</p>
<h3>Key Issues at This Year's Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Police Rate Reduced by Two Percent</p>
<p>Two Additional Chinese Directors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) told reporters yesterday (the 15th) that the Council would propose a reduction of two percent in the police rate at this year's Western ratepayers' annual meeting. He expected that no one would object at that time and that it would be unanimously approved without any doubt. Thereafter, the police rate in the Settlement could be reduced from 1.6 percent to 1.4 percent. In the past, after the police rate was increased by two percent, Chinese ratepayers and various organizations in the Settlement strongly opposed it. Even some Westerners opposed it. Now, after economizing expenses and selling the Electricity Department, the Council's finances have improved slightly, so it is following public opinion and canceling the increase. As for the Chinese directors of the SMC, it will also be proposed at the meeting to increase the number from three to five, while the number of Western directors will remain the same. The outside rumors of an increase in Western directors are completely unfounded. When reporters inquired about the foreign SMC employees' demand for a pay raise, it was said that the foreign employees were demanding a pay raise due to the rising cost of living and the drastic decline in foreign exchange rates, but the matter was still under consideration by the Board of Directors and had not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai County Executive Supervisory Committee Completes the Handover</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Executive Supervisory Committee was produced by the First County Congress and designated by the former Provincial Steering Committee. Since it began its work a year ago, it has been united internally and worked diligently externally, making more contributions to local administrative facilities and gaining the support of all county party members and the trust of the public. Recently, it received an order from the Provincial Consolidation Committee to immediately cease activities and await the assignment of personnel for reorganization. After receiving the order, the Committee rushed to complete the handover, which was quite busy. It was completed yesterday, and all seals, files, equipment, cash, etc., were inventoried and handed over to the custodians by the standing committee members. The case files and documents of each department were also handed over clearly by the heads of each department.</p>
<h3>Fifth Division Muster and Pay</h3>
<p>The Fifth Division of Xiong Shihui's troops, stationed at Fenglin Bridge in this port, with the exception of those stationed in Songjiang, Suzhou, and other places, are garrisoned in various parts of this port. It is learned that the division sent personnel yesterday to muster the troops stationed in Shanghai and issue the November pay. The Thirtieth Regiment stationed in Songjiang is scheduled to be mustered and paid today (the 17th).</p>
<h3>New County Police Chief Did Not Take Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Shanghai County Police Chief, Sun Jinghua, was scheduled to take office on the 16th (yesterday), but because the police pay owed during the tenure of former Chief Zhu had not yet been issued, he was unable to take office. It is now heard that the County Finance Bureau has agreed to advance one and a half months' pay, but there is not enough time to raise the funds. Chief Zhu will have to receive the pay from the Finance Bureau for issuance today before the new chief can take office. If this is not possible today, he will definitely be able to take office tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Robbers with Weapons Commit Robbery on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei Last Night</h3>
<p>Robbers Search and Rob Ten Households</p>
<p>Police Officers and Robbers Exchange Gunfire</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Wounds One Person in the Head</p>
<p>One Robber Arrested on the Spot by Police</p>
<p>Last night around 7:00 PM, five or six robbers broke into the home of Liang Xingyuan, a local resident at No. 12 Song Residence on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. Most of them were armed with pistols. They intimidated the victim and forbade him from making any noise, then ransacked the place. The robbers then broke into the homes of neighbors Song Gengshi, Song Jinyuan, Song Maonv, Wang Boquan, Liang Shisheng, as well as Song Guichun at No. 11, Sha Zicai, Chen Tjin, and Xing Miaogen, confining more than twenty men and women in one room and plundering them. Later, one of the residents secretly went out and reported to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District Police Bureau for assistance.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Gunfire</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, Director Zhang of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District on Tiantong Road immediately ordered Patrol Officer Zhou, Patrol Chief Tong, and others to lead armed police officers to the scene to surround and arrest the robbers. Upon arriving at the destination, they saw that the house was surrounded by fences. As the police officers advanced, they suddenly saw a person emerging from the darkness, wearing a felt hat and a gown, behaving suspiciously. The police officers ordered him to stop and searched him. They found that he was wearing a blue iron machine satin camel hair robe, and another robe underneath. Knowing that he was not a good person, they immediately arrested him. At this moment, a light flashed in front, and someone was seen coming from the darkness, holding a pistol and shouting "Catch the robbers!" The police officers knew that the person must be a robber, so they preemptively opened fire. The robbers also returned fire. About thirty shots were fired. The robbers fled into the darkness.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullet Injures Person</h3>
<p>When the police officers and robbers were exchanging gunfire, Gong Yide, a Chongming resident who lived at No. 16, Alley 16, Jiaotong Road, was urinating outside when a stray bullet flew over and grazed his head. The police officers accompanied him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He was not seriously injured. The first robber who was arrested identified himself as Zhang Youcai, 21 years old, from Funing, residing in a certain hotel in the French Concession. He said that they carried three pistols during the robbery, one of which had been discarded on the side of the road. At the same time, the police found a pink quilt, a lake-colored scarf, a yellow handkerchief, a large red mirror towel, and a gold ring. The first four items were the dowry of a Liang family's daughter, as yesterday was the betrothal day. The motive for the robbery was related to this. The losses suffered by each household are still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Pirates Rampant, Robbing the Haiying Escort Ship</h3>
<p>Dozens of Pirate Ships Surround the Haiying</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Pirates Force Ship to Set Sail</p>
<p>The waters of Sijiao and Shengshan, located more than two hundred li from Wusong Sanjiashui, are vast, with a large concentration of fishing families, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous, attracting the covetous eyes of bandits. Robberies of residents on the islands have been frequent. The night before last, a large number of pirates attempted to raid the mountain (Shengshan), but this was discovered by the water police and the defense corps stationed on the mountain, who gathered and opened fire on the beach. The pirates also returned fire and resisted stubbornly. Both sides fought until about 5:00 AM yesterday morning. While they were fighting intensely, the Haiying, a merchant escort patrol boat of the Dinghai Daishan Fishery Association, passed by. Unexpectedly, dozens of pirate ships surrounded the Haiying. Then, more than a hundred pirates boarded the ship and forced it to sail towards the southeastern waters. The defense corps and water police on the shore witnessed the Haiying being robbed but could not provide assistance because they were on land. Afterwards, they immediately telegraphed the Fourth District Office of the Wusong Water Police, requesting that a warship be dispatched to pursue the pirates and to find a way to rescue the Haiying from danger. They also telegraphed the Shanghai Daishan Fishery Association Office to request instructions.</p>
<h3>The Kidnapper Was Originally a Bandit</h3>
<p>Zhu Ziqian Faces Dual Charges</p>
<p>Fortunately, Madam Huang Wang Was Not Sold</p>
<p>Madam Huang Wang, a young woman of only nineteen years, came to Shanghai from her native Hubei, hoping to work in a cotton mill. She resided at the residence of her relative, Zhang Haixiang, at 256 Huasheng Road. On the evening of the eleventh of this month, around eight o'clock, she was lured away by Zhu Ziqian, a fellow villager. They rode a tram to the Jiangnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, with the intention of selling her. Madam Huang immediately cried for help, and Zhu was arrested and brought to the Provisional Court. He was ordered to be detained for investigation and trial. Now, according to Detective Zhang Yun, it has been discovered that Zhu Ziqian is indeed not a good person. On the afternoon of the twenty-third of last month, he had gathered a gang and, armed with guns, robbed the homes of Aunt Gu and Zhang Aping at 394 Wuzhou Road, stealing clothing and cash worth over 1,300 yuan. The day before yesterday, Huang Bingsan, the husband of Madam Huang, and Zhang Aping, who was robbed, were summoned to the court along with Zhu. Judge Xu conducted the interrogation. First, Huang Bingsan stated that he had brought his wife from their hometown to Kunshan to open a wonton shop. Due to poor business, it was difficult to sustain. He then entrusted his sister, Zhang Haixiang, to bring his wife to Shanghai to work in a cotton mill. Unexpectedly, she was lured away by Zhu. Fortunately, the case was discovered. He requested a severe punishment. Subsequently, Zhang Aping stated that he worked as a driver for a Japanese man named Ishikawa. On the evening of the twenty-third of last month, he returned home around seven o'clock and found thieves looting the upstairs. Zhu was outside acting as a lookout. When Zhu saw him arrive, he dragged him back and another thief pointed a gun at him, threatening him to remain silent. At that time, Zhu was wearing a peaked cap and a yellow cotton robe, and so on. Questioned about the robbery, Zhu Ziqian completely denied it. However, regarding the abduction, he claimed that a person named Tang had taken the woman to the Jiangnan Hotel, and so on.

<h3>A Young Woman Accuses Family of False Accusation, Abuse, and Requests Divorce</h3>
<p>Madam Tang Wang, (maiden name Xiuzhen), is currently twenty years old. Her mother's family lives in the Wujiaxing area near the Hongqiao Airport in the western suburbs of Shanghai. Her father's name is Wang Zhixuan. When Xiuzhen was fourteen years old, she was betrothed to Tang Dongyu, the son of Tang Bai, a farmer from Kangjialang, the thirtieth district of this county (also near the airport). Tang Dongyu is three years younger than Xiuzhen, only seventeen years old this year. Tang Bai was eager for a grandson and he was an only son. So, on the sixteenth day of the third month of the lunar calendar last year, he married them. Later, due to differences of opinion, Xiuzhen quickly returned to her mother's home. At that time, two hundred silver yuan were stolen from her husband's family. Therefore, Xiuzhen was suspected. Her father-in-law, Tang Baiquan, and her great-grandfather-in-law, Tang Zuliang (Baiquan's father), accused Xiuzhen of theft in the local court. Inspector Li summoned her for investigation. The plaintiff's accusation had no supporting evidence. According to the plaintiff's statement, the theft did occur, but it could not be proven whether Tang Wang had stolen it. So, the case was withdrawn in court. Tang Wang returned to her mother's home to reside temporarily. Now, Tang Wang is still unwilling to accept this and has filed a divorce suit in the civil court of the local court. The defendant, Tang Dongyu, also hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to present a defense. Yesterday, Judge Xu opened the court for a joint hearing. The plaintiff, Tang Wang, described the previous situation and requested a divorce. (Question) Do the husband and wife get along well? (Answer) They get along well. (Question) Since they get along well, why do you want a divorce? (Answer) Because my parents-in-law and great-grandfather-in-law beat me, so I informed director Lu Zhuqing. On the tenth day of the ninth month, I returned to my mother's home. They falsely accused me of theft. In this situation, it is impossible to live. I request permission to divorce, etc. The defendant, Tang Dongyu, stated that he was seventeen years old. (Question) Why did you beat her? (Answer) I didn't beat her. Last year, she ran back to her mother's home on her own. (Question) You want to accuse her of stealing two hundred silver yuan, is that right? (Answer) Yes, but the exact amount of silver was small. She is suing for divorce, I don't want to. Wang Zhixuan stated that he was forty-two years old. Tang Wang is my daughter. She was injured by her husband's family before and took four doses of medicine. I reported it to the public security bureau of the sixth district of Huacao. Tang Zuliang stated that he was sixty-two years old. Tang Wang is my granddaughter-in-law. She is usually treated very well, and there is no abuse. Tang Baiquan stated that he was thirty-four years old. The rest of his statement is the same as his father's. Lu Yunxiang stated that Lu Zhuqing is my father. He is absent today due to illness. Tang Wang had a quarrel with her husband's family, and my father tried to mediate, but they did not listen, so this lawsuit occurred. Judge Xu received the statements and asked Inspector Li to come to the court to express his opinion. Then, lawyer Shen Xingxia rose and made a statement. Judge Xu then announced the end of the hearing and scheduled the verdict for one o'clock in the afternoon on the nineteenth of this month.</p>

<p>Zhao Yongkui is Extremely Despicable</p>
<p>The six-year-old daughter of Lu Wusheng, the owner of a sock factory in the Nanyang Bridge area of the French Concession, was recently secretly kidnapped by apprentice Zhao Yongkui and hidden in the home of Zhang Yunlong in Pudong. Detective Hang Guangfu of the French police discovered this, arrested Zhao and Zhang, rescued the girl, and took them to the police station. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the French court for investigation. First, the plaintiff stated that the defendant, Zhao Yongkui, was an apprentice of a merchant. He had finished his apprenticeship and left. Recently, when the merchant returned to his hometown for business, Zhao came to my home and said to my wife, "The master has no business now and is struggling to make a living. You can go out with me to rent a house and live together." After speaking, he took the liberty of sleeping on the merchant's bed and constantly teased my wife, trying to commit adultery. At that time, my wife refused and held her child on a stool, guarding her all night. Unexpectedly, because Zhao failed to seduce her, he kidnapped the child. Now that he has been arrested, I request a heavy punishment. Lu's wife, Zhou, also recounted the previous situation. Questioned, Zhao Yongkui stated that it was true that he took the plaintiff's daughter out to play, but he did not dare to kidnap or seduce her. The rest of his words were evasive. Zhang Yunlong stated that when Zhao Yongkui brought the child to his home, he was out on business and only found out when he returned home, and then sent the child to Zhao's place. He did not know about the kidnapping and asked the court to investigate. Judge Zhu sentenced Zhao to two months in the Western Prison as a warning, and Zhang was released without charge.</p>
<h3>Only Reported After Three Years of Abduction and Escape</h3>
<p>Sang Xiuying's Purpose is 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The woman Sang Xiuying, previously represented by a lawyer, criminally accused Wang Huizhi in the French court of abducting and escaping with her daughter, as well as plotting harm, etc. She was ordered to investigate and review again. The day before yesterday, she was summoned again. First, Judge Zhu instructed the plaintiff, "According to the police investigation, this case happened three years ago. Even if it is true, why didn't you sue earlier?" The plaintiff replied, "At that time, I was constantly deceived by the defendant, falsely recognizing the woman as an adopted daughter, and gave me a savings book with 200,000 yuan, promising that after the term was over, the money would be withdrawn and 20,000 yuan would be allocated to the woman, so I silently endured and did not sue." At this point, the defendant's lawyer claimed that the plaintiff was actually running a private brothel at the time, and the defendant often went there to play. This time, because he failed to extort money from the defendant, he filed a lawsuit with false accusations and asked the court to dismiss the case and allow a counterclaim. Judge Zhu ordered a review for a verdict.</p>

<p>To the esteemed National Federation of Commerce,</p>
<p>I am writing to you with utmost respect. I have repeatedly seen reports in the newspapers regarding the registration deadline for Russian currency, as well as your esteemed association's telegram requesting that Russian currency be used to redeem the Zhongjing Road, etc. I believe that the amount of Russian currency held by the people is not insignificant. Since the registration has already been closed, the total amount registered should be known with certainty. This large amount of Russian currency represents the hard-earned money of our people, exchanged for it through their sweat and blood. The unreasonableness of the violent Russians is a matter of common knowledge, and fortunately, your esteemed association has upheld justice with great determination, which I deeply admire. Regardless of whether it is used to redeem the road, it is absolutely unacceptable to allow them to be cunning. That is all I wish to say. The Sino-Russian Conference in Peiping in 1925 already discussed this matter, but it was interrupted due to the war, which is deeply regrettable. This formal conference should continue to proceed based on the previous case. Regardless of how much is recovered, the people's property is the nation's vitality, and I urge your esteemed association to do its utmost to oversee this matter. Furthermore, during this Sino-Russian war, it happened to coincide with intense internal strife, and the central government was unable to attend to both domestic and foreign concerns. It was entrusted to the Northeast, and fortunately, the officers and soldiers fought bravely. Although the outcome was good, during the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the officers and soldiers died for their country on the battlefield, and the people were displaced on the roads. Whose fault was this? Now that the war can be concluded, the dead cannot be brought back to life, and the displaced have no means to survive. How can anyone with a little humanity not feel sorrow for them? Yesterday, I saw reports proposing compensation. In my opinion, the most important way to provide compensation is to first plan for the families of the martyrs who died for their country, and then for the wounded or disabled soldiers, so as to comfort the loyal souls in the afterlife and support the disabled in this world. As for the displaced people, they should be properly resettled and helped to survive. These few points require substantial funds to make a difference. The government has no surplus funds, and the people in the mainland are facing difficult times, with famine on the roads and few people living in peace. It is difficult to save people from drowning, and it is even more difficult to raise large sums of money. My humble opinion is that a small portion of the recovered Russian currency should be set aside for this purpose (for example, if 100 million yuan is recovered, 20% should be extracted, which would yield 20 million yuan, and so on) to be used for this compensation. This would be a one-stone, multi-bird achievement. I believe that those who hold Russian currency will definitely not oppose this proposal, and I hope that your esteemed association will also support this idea and do its utmost to implement it. This would not only be fortunate for those who hold the currency, but also for the people of the Northeast. This is just my humble opinion, and I hope it will be adopted and forwarded to the government, and I earnestly request that it be published in the newspapers to seek public support. I would be extremely grateful. I hereby pay my respects, Wu Weixian.</p>

<h3>Land Bureau</h3>
<p>▲Approval: Zheng Wei Yi submitted a document regarding compliance with notification to supplement the grain receipts and describe the circumstances.  Having reviewed the submission, since it is stated that the grain receipt submitted by the petitioner is for Zhang Yulin, single household No. 115, with a field tax of five li, and there is no reporting of receiving or verifying land, we should instruct an investigation to clarify the matter before further review and processing. The grain receipt is kept on file. ▲Wang Zhen, representative of the Great Harmony Wheel Step Company, submitted a document stating that the land rental should be legally maintained and requesting review. Upon review of the submission, it is found that the cancellation of the public land rented by the company was handled according to Municipal Government Order No. 2251 of September 11, year 18, and the company was notified accordingly on the 14th of the same month. Furthermore, on November 21, year 18, Municipal Government Instruction No. 2458 was received, stating that if merchants' rental of public land is deemed to hinder the purpose of reorganizing the Nanshi shoreline and docks, it should not be approved. The Bureau must comply with this instruction. The request to maintain the status quo is difficult to approve. We hereby issue this approval for your information. ▲Lu Linsheng submitted a document requesting record of grain single land being fraudulently transferred. The submission and attachments have been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioner owns a field tax lot of one mu, four li, and eight hao, registered under Lu Qingyu, single household No. 87, Jingzi Xu, fifth tu, 27th bao, and a field tax lot of three fen registered under Lu Liu Guan, single household No. 231, and has heard that relatives intend to seize and transfer the land. Since the single receipt has been submitted for verification, we should instruct an investigation to clarify the matter before further review and decision. The field single is issued. The two copies of the grain receipt are kept on file. ▲Wu Xisheng et al. submitted a document requesting the exchange of land certificates due to family property division. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that the petitioners intend to divide the property and request a review to separately transfer and exchange certificates for the field tax lot of one mu, seven fen, three li, and two hao, registered under Wu Gengsheng, No. 5, 24th qiu, Sanguo Xu, 26th tu, Gaoqiao district, and the field tax lot of two mu and five fen, registered under Wu Genggeng and Wu Xixi, No. 18, 13th hao, Dongrun Xu, 27th tu, with four field singles. Upon verifying the household names and mu fen of the submitted grain receipts, they are consistent with the divided field singles and should be approved. You should come to the Bureau to pay the transfer fee of seven yuan, six jiao, and two fen in silver, and the certificate map fee of two yuan and four jiao in silver, before you can exchange the land practice certificate. The copy of the grain receipt for property division is kept on file, and the original is returned. ▲Yuan Xin Yi submitted a document to prevent fraudulent receipt of land practice certificates, stating the circumstances of acceptance of mortgage and requesting registration approval. The submission has been reviewed. It is stated that Zhang Ling, the owner of the field tax lot of three mu, nine fen, and nine li, one hao, No. 2, 5th qiu, Baizi Xu, 1st tu, Zhabei district, has a field single. The petitioner has now accepted the mortgage. The reported loss by Zhang Qisheng et al. is not factual, and the field single and mortgage agreement have been submitted. After verification by the Bureau, it is found to be true and should be approved for registration, stopping the supplementary issuance and notifying Zhang Qisheng et al. for their information. The original of the field single and mortgage agreement is returned, and a copy is kept on file. ▲Yao Shoukui submitted a document reporting the loss of the field single and requesting supplementary issuance of the land certificate. The submission has been reviewed.  Since the request to issue a supplementary land practice certificate has been advertised in the newspaper and the grain receipt has been submitted for verification, we should instruct an investigation to clarify the matter before further review and decision. The eight copies of the grain receipt and two copies of the newspaper are kept on file. ▲Zhang Baiji et al. submitted a document to surrender the Ministry's certificate and verify the grain receipt, requesting the issuance of a land certificate. The submission has been reviewed. The petitioners reported receiving 107 mu and 7 fen of beach land within the Xirun and Nanrun two Xu, 27th tu, Gaoqiao district, holding eight certificates from the Ministry of Finance. The owners are Zhang Baiji, Yin Junji, Guo Mengji, Zhang Baiji, Yan Yangji, Shengji, Ling Yunji, etc., totaling seven households. Upon verifying with the submitted grain receipts, except for the mu fen and household names of Zhang Baiji, Yin Junji, and Guo Mengji being consistent, the mu fen of the remaining four households such as Zhang Baiji are inconsistent and have been divided into more than ten households, which is obviously a trick to privately purchase the land after receiving the certificate without establishing a contract. Furthermore, there is no mention of whether the land has been measured and designated with numbered qiu by the Baoshan Cendan Bureau. Checking the map register, there is no record of this numbered qiu and mu fen, making verification impossible. The request for measurement is difficult to approve. We hereby issue this approval for your information. The certificate from the Ministry of Finance is returned, and the grain receipt draft is temporarily kept on file. The above is from Director Zhu Yan, February 8th.</p>

<p>▲Buddhist Painting Exhibition Opens: Shanghai Newspaper Office announces that Qian Junhua, a Buddhist, used to be involved in the revolution and contributed to the Party and the country.

It is said that his painting of Buddhist images is also a way to repent for everything. It is heard that he will be traveling to the South Seas Islands again this spring and is scheduled to set sail in early March, for about half a year. Therefore, his friends, such as Yu Youren, Wang Yiting, and Wang Xiaolai, have requested that Qian Jun hold a Buddhist painting exhibition before his departure from the country, as a farewell gesture. It has already started today (the 15th) and will last until the 25th, showcasing more than thirty of his works that he usually refuses to show, publicly for exhibition. The location is in the hall of the World Moral Society at No. 50 Jing'an Temple Road. This is nothing less than Qian Jun's farewell gesture.</p>

Dr. Tang specializes in treating leukorrhea, using the latest modern methods and offering electrical therapy.</p>
<p>▲Zhang Ruwei's Busy Consultations: Zhang Ruwei, a famous doctor in Daqing Li, Nanjing Road, announces that he recently returned home to visit his mother, who was ill. After diagnosis and treatment, she quickly recovered. Relatives and friends in his hometown insisted on him staying to provide medical care, almost preventing him from leaving. He has now arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, and his consultations are very crowded. Because I can accurately identify the cause of illness and guide patients, and do not focus solely on money or scare patients, those who trust and seek treatment from me all achieve complete recovery.</p>

<h3>American Women's Art Exhibition Changxi</h3>
<p>The 39th exhibition of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in New York displays the works of women from all over the country in the art exhibition. This exhibition includes 360 paintings, 39 sculptures, 20 color portraits, and many black-and-white mixed modern paintings. At the opening, a prize was announced to encourage women to engage in this field. However, many people are dissatisfied with this art exhibition, believing that if they were not women, they and a group of viewers would be deceived in fact, and the color tones are not as noteworthy as Ms. Kangli's personal exhibition after returning from Europe.</p>
<p>Ms. Rheodora Kane is an internationally renowned painter. Her journals and watercolors are highly praised. Although she is only 23 years old, she has already made a name for herself in the art circles of Lun Guo, Paris, and Vienna. She has held many exhibitions in European countries. Now, she is holding her first public exhibition of her five or sixty works written in foreign countries in her hometown of New York.</p>
<p>The lady's husband is an official living in Florence, Italy, so the lady has a deep understanding of the Italian schools of painting. She is taking advantage of the opportunity to return to her country with her husband to celebrate her fifth wedding anniversary and hold a grand art exhibition in her hometown.</p>
<p>In 1923, Ms. Kangli accepted a place from the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts to study at the Paris branch. During the one-year graduation course, she received great praise from the Paris art world. Later, she also studied painting at the St. Martin's and Westminster Schools in Lun Guo. She has a deep understanding of the French and British schools of painting.</p>
<p>Because of her husband's relationship, the lady was able to study in Europe for a long time. She expressed all the characteristics of many famous small countries, such as Spain, Jack, and Arnia, on her canvases. Critics believe that she can capture the momentary scene of the local area. Among women, Ms. Kangli can be regarded as the first to fully express the foreign style on the canvas.</p>
<h3>Ode to the Breasts Sunflower</h3>
<p>Your breasts are like a pair of young deer grazing among the lilies, a pair of twin deer returning to the Mountain of Frankincense</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>Your breasts are like fruits hanging heavily on the tree</p>
<p>I want to go up the Palma tree and hold its branches</p>
<p>Your breasts are like clusters of grapes</p>
<p>Let us rise early and go to the vineyard to see if the vines have budded, if they have blossomed</p>
<p>丨Old Testament "Song of Songs"</p>
<p>Have you read the Christian Old Testament Bible and still remember the two paragraphs of "Ode to the Breasts" in the "Song of Songs" sung by King Solomon?</p>
<p>In works of art, the feeling that is the most seductive, stimulating, and at the same time makes people feel the ultimate beauty and sensuality is the female topless sculpture and painting. Similarly, in works of literature, whether it is poetry or prose, the most beautiful and touching is naturally all works that praise the beauty of the female body. Now, I will randomly quote a few fragments from the books on the desk to help the discussion.</p>
<p>In ancient Western literary works, in addition to the Old Testament Bible mentioned above, there are many ancient poems. The most famous one is the ancient Greek love song. Greece was originally a country of flesh and drunkenness. In Piene Louiys's retranslation of "The Songs of Bilitis" (there is a Chinese translation by Li Jinfan, namely Ancient Greek Love Songs), there is a song called "To My Breasts," flesh blooming.</p>
<p>Ah, my breasts, how rich you are in flesh!</p>
<p>My breasts are in my hands,</p>
<p>Why do you have this kind of fatigue, tired heat, and fresh fragrance?</p>
<p>In the past, you were like a marble statue, cold as a chest, hard like ignorant and unconscious marble. Since you have yielded, I love you even more. You are loved,</p>
<p>Your shape is smooth and full, it is the glory of my red flesh, whether I am wearing you under a golden hair band, or I am completely naked and give you to you, it is all because you have the shining green before me,</p>
<p>Enjoy yourself tonight, if my fingers have newly invented the technique of stroking, only you can know tomorrow that B paid B for this night.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>I very much suspect that these love songs are all from the pen of Louis, not the ode of some Bilitis. Clever Louis, why did you give such beautiful poems to a Greek prostitute of the sixth century BC? In his novel "Aphrodite" (there is a Chinese translation by Dongya Sick Man and Xu Bai, namely "Flesh and Death". Recently, I heard that someone has retranslated it and renamed it "Beautiful Sexual Life"),</p>
<p>He also borrowed from an Indian love song and made Ge Lixue and Da Ruola, the mistress and maid, sing like this:</p>
<p>丨Your breasts are two silver shields, and the nipples are soaked with bloodstains,</p>
<p>丨My breasts are round and bright moons, the reflection of the moons, swaying in the water,</p>
<p>How charming are these love songs! When Dongya Sick Man translated "Flesh and Death," he must have been inspired by Louis's golden verses, so he often picked up his pen to create "Lu Manzi," which also made him feel the inspiration for the praise of the female body. Let us try to read Tang Yunfeng's self-admiration of his breasts,</p>
<p>Her breasts are bare, and in the misty valley of the scarlet gauze apron, there are twin lotus buds reflecting each other, printing out a light and tight flower belt. This was still in the early summer of last year, an accidental discovery of a new flower in the flat jade field. At the time of discovery, the whole body felt an unknown tremor, gradually blooming, and gradually growing, and now it seems that a core has formed...</p>
<p>In Chinese characters, there are many beautiful phrases and wonderful words about describing female breasts. We will not cite them all here.</p>
<p>Those poets who praise women all like to use symbolic descriptions to compare breasts, such as young deer, grape fruit, silver shield, bright moon, lotus sleep, jade peak, and chicken head, but these many symbolic descriptions have been used too much. Recently, I read a poem "Breasts" by Japanese Horikuchi Daigaku, which is full of fantastic ideas. Only this poem can defeat all other "Odes to the Breasts" from ancient times to the present. Now, according to Mr. Bai Bi's translation, I will copy it at the end of the article. I believe that in the old parchment scrolls or thread-bound books, you will never find such a fresh ode to the breasts.</p>
<p>Virtue is not alone, there are two breasts, (1)</p>
<p>There are two breasts,</p>
<p>There are also two palms, (2)</p>
<p>The breasts are in the shape of my palms, (3)</p>
<p>Breasts are made for palms,</p>
<p>Palms are made for breasts, (4)</p>
<p>Breasts, the feast of the palms,</p>
<p>Breasts, the paradise of micro-gardens, (5)</p>
<p>Breasts, Twin Peaks,</p>
<p>Breasts, two hemispheres, (6)</p>
<p>Breasts, white wings,</p>
<p>Breasts, a red-mouthed dove, (7)</p>
<p>Breasts, the geometry of the female body,</p>
<p>Breasts, the Balance of the female body (8)</p>
<p>Breasts, the poetics of love,</p>
<p>Breasts, the rhythm of caress, (9)</p>
<p>Breasts, sleeping white snakes,</p>
<p>Breasts, the climate of the temperate zone, (10)</p>
<p>From the softness and hardness of her breasts, you know the time of night, (11)</p>
<p>Breasts, trembling creatures,</p>
<p>Breasts, gasping fruits, (12)</p>
<p>The breasts at dawn,</p>
<p>White camellias, (13)</p>
<p>The breasts of the bathing man,</p>
<p>Scarlet lotuses, (14)</p>
<p>Breasts, invisible shapes,</p>
<p>Breasts, careful licentiousness, (15)</p>
<p>Breasts, shot with flirtatious eyes,</p>
<p>The desire of men, (16)</p>
<p>Afraid of the breasts withering,</p>
<p>She wraps them in tulle, (17)</p>
<p>Breasts, the first bait for men,</p>
<p>Breasts, the last thirst of men, (18)</p>
<p>Breasts, the second floor of the female body,</p>
<p>Breasts, the dome of passion, (19)</p>
<p>When she is sleeping,</p>
<p>The breasts close their pupils, (20)</p>
<p>Breasts, the moonlight of the female body,</p>
<p>Breasts, the soap bubble of lovers (21)</p>
<p>Breasts, the residence of women,</p>
<p>Breasts, the belvedere of human beauty,</p>
<p>Breasts, breasts, breasts</p>
<p>The lover of the palms,</p>
<h3>Physical Examination - Youmei</h3>
<p>Hai Ning Road A. K. Girls' Middle School held a physical examination the week before last, with a total of 82 people examined. The youngest age was 16, and the oldest was 29. There were many items examined, among which the most important thing for women to pay attention to is, of course, menstruation.</p>
<p>Normally, menstruation occurs once a month, with each period lasting three to four days, and the amount of menstrual flow should be between four and seven ounces to be considered normal. However, the results of the school's survey showed that the number of qualified and unqualified cases were equal. The statistics are as follows:</p>
<p>(Number of days from the last period to the</p>
<p>next period) (28-29 days | 41 people (normal)</p>
<p>Less than one month | 16 people</p>
<p>More than one month | 8 people</p>
<p>Indeterminate | 12 people</p>
<p>Not written</p>
<p>2.  Number of clean days for each period (3-4 days | 36 people (normal)</p>
<p>2 days | 4 people</p>
<p>5 days | 10 people</p>
<p>6 days or more | 12 people</p>
<p>Indeterminate | 13 people</p>
<p>Not written)</p>
<p>3.  Amount of menstruation (Not too much, not too little | 38 people (normal)</p>
<p>Too much | 15 people</p>
<p>Too little | 21 people</p>
<p>Indeterminate | 8 people)</p>
<p>The above items did not specify a definite amount, and the words "too much" or "too little" are very vague. However, this item is not easy to</p>
<p>investigate to a precise number.</p>
<p>4.  Does your stomach hurt during your period? (No pain | 42 people (normal)</p>
<p>(Pain | 19 people</p>
<p>Sometimes pain, sometimes no pain | 21 people)</p>
<p>5.  Any special circumstances during menstruation? (Impatient | 7 people</p>
<p>Dizziness | 4 people</p>
<p>Not written)</p>
<p>Looking at the above survey results, women's physiological hygiene is so important. Even female students in the intellectual class have so many symptoms, how can others be expected to be better?</p>
<h3>Ms. Ku Peng Wins Religious Novel Prize</h3>
<p>In 1928, women's activity in literature reached a peak. In addition to the Nobel Prize for Literature being awarded to Norwegian female writer Undset, the three major literary prizes of Germany, France, and the United States, as well as newly emerging prizes, were all won by women. Due to the liberation in recent years, women have gradually gained more knowledge in various fields, so they are excellent in writing war, religious, and social novels. Amidst the wave of voices that prizes in England are always won by women, the recent £1,000 religious novel competition prize was won by Ms. Lettice Uiphja Cooper for her "The Ship of Truth." Ms. Cooper has published four historical novels. This victory was achieved from four hundred manuscripts. Her first work was a description of modern life, written in five weeks, which deeply expresses all aspects of human life. The prize-winning work subtly contains religious ideas in a very profound way. The reason she was able to defeat four hundred manuscripts was because this feature was recognized by the prize-giving authorities. (Changxi)</p>
