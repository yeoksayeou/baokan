<p>裁判無理徧袒騰笑萬邦</p>
<p>三對三無勝負錦標保留</p>
<p>（東京通信）本届足球戰中日本首以七對五戰勝菲軍聲勢浩大旋我國亦以五對零勝菲雙方成對抗之勢於二十九日下午三時在神宮田徑賽塲中日足球作最后之决賽觀衆近萬我國拉拉隊全體到塲助威紅帽白服搖旗呐喊精神百倍不料裁判員竹内虎土毫無體育仁精俠神竟任意徧袒日本對我方球員輒加以無理處割而以越位爲阻碍我隊進攻唯一利器在塲觀衆除日人外莫不氣憤塡胸但我隊員頗能處以鎭静忽氣作戰最后猶能以三對三戰成平局誠非易事也茲將作戰經過詳述如下</p>
<p>裁判政策　此次日方對於各種球類賽利用裁判員之徧袒當上塲之初即以嚴格對施使對方運動員精神不振然後日軍乘機攻擊是日之足球戰亦然最初之十五分鐘内凡我隊前鋒得球衡破日隊内衛線時裁判員即大吹其笛高呼越位可氣亦復可笑也至是我方進攻不能祇得退守至第二十五分鐘時被日本中鋒手島志郎氏攻進一球我方形勢益爲不利球時在我門前盤旋幸鐵門周賢言把守得宜否則更不知輸去若干也</p>
<p>戰成平局　茲後我隊又罰越位數次幸我將士用命隊長孫錦順奮不顧身單槍匹隊直陷敵陣卒於三十七分鐘時由右方踢入一球戰成平局而日人之裁判政策不得不暫告失敗前局終了結果爲一對一無勝負而最告令人記念者即我隊於前半局被罰越位之七次之多日方則並無一次也</p>
<p>十二分鐘　易地再戰後我隊處逆風益爲不利未三分鐘即被罰二次角球危險萬狀至第十二分鐘時日本之前鋒又蠭擁而至中鋒手島復攻人一球成一對二日本勝我隊見形勢險惡急調軍換將以葉北華易陳家球馮運佑易李寗生力軍下場後我方陣容頓爲一振在十六分鐘時中鋒戴麟經盤球直逼敵門舉足微揚球已入網成二對二又無勝負</p>
<p>無理被罰　在第二十三分鐘時日隊右翼高山得球直進梁賢贊急過去搶奪裁判員忽大鳴笛宣稱犯規應罰十二碼球觀衆均爲我隊擔憂但球竟越横木而過所謂天意無倖得也</p>
<p>分數又等　第二十八分鐘時日隊又傾軍來攻右鋒篠島在球門邊攻進一球周賢言挽救已無及成二對三日本又勝幸於三十五分鐘時陳先耀得球直衡旋傳與孫錦順孫傳陳家球至球門前陳又傳與戴麟經戴旋身拚命一脚球躍入網内又成三對三之平局</p>
<p>最后肉搏　茲後雙方爲最后五分鐘之奮門我軍氣勢轉盛全軍向敵壓迫曾有五次打門機會均未中的可惜之至最可惜者一爲孫錦順在球門前獲球日守門員急奔出搶奪未得手孫稍心慌右脚一揚球太徧向右竟出界線第二爲戴麟經在球門十步左右攻門稍高一寸球未入網誠爲萬分不幸未幾銀笛聲中球戰終了結果三對三</p>
<p>宣告停止　按足球規例雙方無隊　時應延長二十分鐘但日裁判員竟宣告今日停止訂期再賽我隊大譁即由教練向總教練馬約翰報告正式提出抗議以裁判員無權推翻足球規則爲理由日方辭窮是晚七時開委員會雙方辯論甚久議决足球不再比賽錦標保留至下届大會再定我總代表張伯苓對此極不爲然堅持非續賽不可經召集職員會議認日裁判無理可喻再賽利少害多始决不賽焉</p>
<p>僑民公憤　是日觀戰之拉拉隊及我國僑民不下千餘人見日本裁判員若是無理壓迫引起公憤戰畢後在田徑塲集合不散推定代表三人見郝伯陽請體恊會同日方正式交涉若無結果應請退出遠東運動會經郝再三撫慰始行散去</p>

<p>我國前半時以唐寳堃姚恩漢任前鋒　建常任中鋒陸冠軍陸鍾恩任後衛開始未一分鐘日方大橋即投入一球首開紀錄至一分半鐘時陸踵恩罰人一分成二對一之比此後兩方對抗極力日方屢圖進攻均未得逞迄五分時大橋又投入第二球七分時新換進之中鋒小林攻入一球成六與一之比未幾日方前鋒繼續投入達十四與一之大差在十四分鐘時劉建常連獲二球至上半時終了時結果爲二十一對十一中國以十點敗北</p>
<p>下半時我隊以陳盛魁代唐寳堃王玉增代劉建常魏蓬雲代劉冠軍開始後日本先獲一球　則我軍陳盛魁及姚恩漢亦有所獲此時我軍氣勢轉盛屢得投籃惜均未奏效而尤以王玉增君所失機會爲多我國努力追趕成二十三對十九相差僅二球但日方亦不示弱大橋田中繼續進攻得法紀錄忽增至二十九對十九分我軍見日方氣燄轉强立即下令改變陳線繼入塲者爲唐寳堃及魏篷雲爲前鋒劉建常中鋒李國琛王錫良爲後衛此後兩方各有所獲而我隊見大勢將去更有努力但陣線因之紊亂最後劉建常被罰出塲我隊更莫能爲力矣總結果爲三十七對二十一我隊以十六分敗北焉是晚之戰我隊表演尙不惡保守方面似略較前次對日時嚴密但唐寳堃君未得活動機會且各隊員投籃欠埠磪實爲失敗之兩大原因也</p>

<p>是晚任裁判者仍爲前次之田中與東城二氏東城氏前次審判失當早爲觀衆所不滿是晚更有不合行爲對於我國球員常以怒目相視幸我隊員均能忍耐即有失當之審判亦全服從之比賽完畢後觀衆多認東城氏有失裁判員體統殊不應以意氣從事羣起向之質問幾至動武幸東城見機先走又經我國職員多方制止方無事而散云</p>

<p>陣線亂極一無聯絡戰法</p>
<p>（東京通訊）二十八日晚七時半中非籃球第二次交鋒此爲中國隊之最後一次機會觀衆並不十分擁擠中國啦啦隊蒞塲助威者亦寥寥可數此蓋鑒於中國隊迭次之失敗减少鼓舞者之興趣也就技術而論我隊確較在國内所表演者退步合作時之　緩擲籃之不準爲最大毛病其擲球數與擲中數之百分率平均約百分之三十左右即十次擲球中僅擲中三球也菲日兩方平均在百分之六·七·十上下則中華安得不負是晚之戰尤爲可笑前半時中除唐寶琨外餘均非正式陣線而結果竟能以三十比十五得勝後半時除陸鐘恩被間四次出塲及劉冠軍之内衞外餘均爲正式陣線而竟以十三對三十三大敗豈非咄咄怪事是晚裁判員極爲公道中國戰士之罪莫可逃矣</p>

<p>大會閉幕式　　總裁秩父宮給獎　　菲軍大反攻　休息後易地再戰菲軍鑒於前半時之失敗亦一味用遠射戰略我隊防守尚固激戰五分鐘無勝負第六分鐘唐寳琨又犯規被菲内衛罰中一球首開紀錄是時我方以姚恩漢易陳盛魁作戰亦敵不過菲軍之攻擊連續失去十一分之多我隊尚未拿到一分急調軍易將以劉建常易王玉增李國琛易劉冠軍戰勢始稍稍轉易劉建常首爲我隊奏功擲中二球罰中一球是時雙方又恢復平衡之戰狀實力相捋至最後之八分鐘時紀錄爲四十二對三十六中國勝但不幸陸鍾恩被罰四次出塲急代以劉冠軍唐寳琨被罰三次亦不敢有所活動苟能處以鎭静以逸待勞亦不至失敗不料戰士個個手忙脚亂仍向敵方亂攻致反被菲軍所乘紀錄由四十二對三十六而四十二對三十八而四十二對四十二分數平均後菲軍更勇我軍更亂李國琛又犯規一次被菲軍罰中成四十二對四十三旋在二分鐘内又被菲軍攻破二球成四十二對四十七於是遂陷於不可收拾地步至是僅餘一分鐘唐寳琨連得罰球機會三次僅罰中一球菲亦罰中一球下半時十三對二十三中國失敗總分四十八對四十三菲大勝</p>

<p>（東京通訊）中國李氏姊妹對加得雅與雅各約女士之雙打第二日以五對五因雨中止第三日午前十時繼續比賽李氏姊妹連赢二盤勝第一局繼以三對六輸去第二局在最後一局中靡戰至烈中先獲一盤續失二盤第四·五·六盤中兩方各不相讓球往復至久終至六對三之結局李　杏花牡丹　七—五　三—六　六—三　加利雅雅各約</p>
<p>李氏姊妹均以穏重見長多在後端待球杏花女士之救球尤見功夫牡丹女士較多進攻之抽打但未見大効菲方則加利雅居後雅各得在前李氏姊妹因避免雅各約之網打起見故屢次將球送至敵方後部使加利雅疲於奔命難以爲繼此實李氏姊妹獲勝之一大因</p>
<p>中菲女子單打午後二時半開始第一塲李牡丹女士對加利雅女士菲代表一鼓作氣以六對二勝第一局牡丹女士大有不支之勢在第二局中李氏奔馳頗力在四對二之比時忽連勝三盤局事從此變轉機遂以七對五及六對二共勝兩局一塲惡戰之勝利即我國勝非之關頭也第二塲之戰爲我國李牡丹對阿朝亞夫人後者爲菲島最優選手但今日表演未見特長李牡丹似有敷衍了事之情形奔馳旣未出力抽打亦少奏効在第一局中僅勝第三及第七兩盤第二局中略有較好之表演常在網邊接球獲勝但從第五盤起杏花小姐有此些發火遂與敵人以取勝之機成六對三之比　　綜觀是日之女子單打牡丹女士確有非常之功績二種問逸不忙攻虚避霄的優點遠非對方加利雅女士所能及加女士奔得香汗津津衣褲全濕而李小姐却水不飮汗不拭然則李女士之獲勝實非偶然也</p>

<p>今欲數荀慧生之名劇首必舉「十三妹」此係南北所公認絶非阿私所好者之諛詞蓋除瑤卿外只一慧生能符合女俠婀娜剛健之神情故也是以今春在滬每貼此劇必拉鐵門其盛可知大中華唱片公司特倩荀君灌收弓硯緣之二六佳腔極多佐以馬富祿之花面鄧九公益覺生色添妍慧生之唱片固夥然其第一傑作之十三妹尙係初次灌入唱片尤足珍焉</p>
<p>探親相駡係婦孺皆知之滑稽喜劇瑤卿當年爲此劇妙材今惟慧生能具旗籍貴婦之雍容華貴氣象然瑤卿病嗓不宜於灌收唱片故當謀諸慧生彩旦一角亦須搭配整齊始有相得益彰之妙今除馬富祿外又有幾人能稱斯職者是故聽荀馬二君合唱之全齣探親相駡覺其插科逗趣之京白婉妙圓潤之唱腔在在足以顯出美具難并之優點也</p>
<p>今之演翠屏山者以荀慧生小翠花二君稱一時瑜亮然慧生嗓甜善歌故在唱片之中實較翠花佔優勢大中華唱片公司曾將其出帳之南梆子一段收入中夾如怨如訴之念白便不覺乾枯單調環顧南北終須推慧生爲此劇霸王也</p>

<h3 id="c195">復旦劇社公演西哈諾 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>本月十日在復旦體育館良鶴（西哈諾）這個偉大的劇本終於給復旦劇社在本月十號搬上了中國的舞台了這是在嚣俄的（歐那尼）而後的唯一無偶的浪漫派的劇本是使那股浪漫派的火樣熱情重新在人們心靈中燃熾起來的劇本大膽地將極濃厚的詩意搬上舞台的浪漫主義本來是依照倍根的說法對於人們在自然世界中所不能獲得的種種給與以滿意和安慰他主張靈魂是高於現實的世界的靈魂需要一種偉大一種善一種在自然中所不能找到的變化只有在浪漫派的藝術中能夠滿足這些要求即是在現在的一班浪漫詩人還以倍根這樣的說法爲口實藝術本來就是現實的躱避啊一班自然主義者是專門模仿自然表現自然的一切缺點而浪漫主義者則從自然世界中獲得一種救濟這點在比較上自要强差人意了</p>
<p>浪漫派的運動是繼續不斷的只要世界上的青年還存在只要關於青年的記憶還保留只要好奇的心情還生存浪漫派的作品是終歸要存在的啊</p>
<p>羅斯當的（西哈諾）便是一個絶好的代表浪漫派作品的典型劇本</p>
<p>劇中主角西哈諾是十七世紀的大詩人極爲勇敢他却秘密地愛上了他的表妹可是他的表妹霍克桑却不大注意他他的鼻子生得是那樣大而且醜使得她忽視了他心中的熱情她的心完全趨向了克里斯欽是一位没有思想口才和熱情的簡單的靈魂西哈諾自已極力地自制着他不單避開了他的情敵他却還帮助他向她求婚使得他俩結合而在戰塲上却又像愛子一樣地保護他的情敵想着吧這是多麽難堪的事情啊自已心愛的人給别人奪去了而又還要爲了顧全自已心愛的人的幸福而極力成全他人的好事</p>
<p>不過在最後克里斯欽死去而後我們的英雄西哈諾還約束着他自已對霍克桑的愛他還是秘密含忍着他的熱情他一毫也不給與任何的暗示一直到最後他行將死去的時候他才將他那封用克里斯欽的名字來寫的最後的一封信中的辭句向她吐露這樣霍克桑才知道其中一切的底細可是西哈諾却始終否認他曾愛過她而就這樣地死去了</p>
<p>這劇本的動人的地方大部分是由於其中</p>
<p>不可必的地方其中疾駛的動作不可信的勇氣那位女英雄的忽然從艱苦的旅途中蒞臨到軍營之中那個在克里斯欽死去後十四年中西哈諾自已的不可能的抑制丨都像傅說中一樣地動人而並又不像那種妄誕的傅說其中的事實却不是不可信的</p>
<p>（西哈諾）這劇本不但是在人物利題材的方面富具浪漫的色彩即是在其中的塲所和詩意方面包富具熱情我們只要着那一幕西哈諾在劇院中禁止那個演員的登台他和那個嘲笑他的鼻子的子爵比劍的塲合以及那一幕西哈諾帮助着他的情敵向憑着月台上的霍克桑求婚她目視着克里斯欽美麗的身軀而耳却聽着西哈诺動人的詞句丨在這樣的一個黑夜之下想着是多誘惑人吧</p>
<h3 id="c196">看（威尼斯商人）後 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>楣</p>
<p>轟動一時的（威尼斯商人）此刻已變爲</p>
<p>陳跡了在戲劇恊社的公演史上不消說又深深地留下一頁榮當與該社曾經所公演的（第二萝）有同等的價值就是在</p>
<p>我們觀衆的腦海裏也是難以泯滅的</p>
<p>戲劇協社同人是明明虚懷若谷地願意接受人家的批評的他們這樣的說（看得不好請訴我們伎魯試者有改進的指針）指針確不敢當不過將我當時所見到而感觸的約略寫在下面</p>
<p>全體演員的藝術表現都還有相當的工夫其中以沈潼君的夏勞克爲最妙可謂異善盡美當他在威尼斯法庭上的一幕表情那是多麽難演而沈君演得竟是多麽體貼入微真筆難形容虞岫雲的濮茜亞尙屬不差可惜講話太快有許地方來不及傅神可謂美中不足也至黄一美的安東尼似乎略嫌遲鈍也還有幾位國語尙欠準確與純熟蓋威尼斯商人本來不是容易表演的丨丨尤其是搬到異國情調的上海來今已有如此成績實非易易該社辛苦經營之下亦足自慰了</p>
<p>唯其他們是虚懷若谷願意接受人家的忠</p>
<p>告所以我便不客氣了以誠懇的態度講幾句忠實之言</p>
<p>我們不演外外國劇本則已旣採取了當然要希望將這出戲從劇本中搬到</p>
<p>舞台上來才行不可有絲毫顧忌否則將失其真彩也就是我們愛看外國影片而不滿意於中國影片的一個原因當白山奴向濮茜亞求婚求中了的時候白山奴是幾多快活漢亞也是如何的願意他喜極欲狂抱着她的相片叫好丨丨美人兒天使她也向他說了許多好話丨丨</p>
<p>我是你的了我從今後一切都交給你了隨即將她手上一隻貴重的戒指交給他作爲訂婚的永久紀念這一刻這美滿的一刻這多麽值得紀念的一刻啊在理起码也該有一個較長的甜吻擁抱這是一輩而下的事體當毋庸議而他們竟就這樣淡然置之地演過連手都没有碰着這是多麽可惜地而令觀者失望呵但不愛好藝術的虞女士和陳君爲怎麽要省此一舉至若謂怕人家誹議中國非外國可比那簡想可不必顧及這點乾脆地說略藝術的人或愛好藝術的人他們不會來誹議的除非那班市井之徒他决所下的批評更何足計呢我勸虞女士要放出點勇敢的精神來當時我見了就有點不滿我想應該有個擁抱和接吻後來回去番劇本果然也是應該有的</p>
<p>還有化裝方面雖然都是西服但在女的身上我覺得有點未能逼真的地方劇中的女角上去都是像中國女人着西裝</p>
<p>胸部臀部似嫌太平坦應該裝得丰滿些頭髮在那時西洋少女兩鬢處都有兩支鬢髮拖下作者曾在許多書上見至都是如此</p>
<p>這樣求免太忠實了吧未知恊社諸君見</p>
<p>了以爲然否</p>

<p>微茵</p>
<p>爲了有幾位女同學的愛好滑冰而大好的子彬院的水門汀上又被訓育主任禁止了不得再行滑冰於是投機的同學便在大學的後門鳩工建築了一所跑冰塲本來是只有幾位女同學高興穿上了Ａhates在光滑的地上滑着現在有了跑冰塲精於此道的男同學也去凑熱閙了</p>
<p>復大的跑冰塲前天開幕了塲主的心思也委實很不錯他在開幕的當兒向全校的同學分送請客單計算後日的同學有一千五百餘人之多連信封連請客單共費三千份這筆開銷也不少呢</p>
<p>第一天開幕時生意是非常地好因爲門</p>
<p>票只有二角小洋一點鐘而又可以延長同時又有幾個嗜好跑冰的女同學來參加一般男同學自趨之若蠅之附腥了</p>
<p>在跑冰塲的中央只看到這幾位花蝴蝶似的女同學在疾駛着惡作劇的男同學則故意往來地攔阻她們的去路有的甚而至於不惜犧牲了自已潔白的西裝褲子裝着跌倒在上故意和她們留難她們當然也不示弱她們會大家牵着手一同增加戰鬥力</p>
<p>有的同學真的傾跌在跑冰塲的中央的那便引得大家者笑了起來而尤其是當女同學跌倒的時候那是要哄堂大閙的有一位梳着兩根辮子的小姑娘她對於跑冰還不十分諳熟時常會有翻金斗的事她終是鼓着小嘴埋怨着笑她的男同學</p>
<p>跑冰塲的佈置很簡單但很檏素光線雖不見得充足空氣却還很新鮮聽說在最近的將來旁邊還有一家咖啡店要開張呢那時挾着愛侶一同去跑了冰後携着手到這家咖啡店來吃一些東西那不是和在燈紅酒綠紙迷金醉的跳舞塲中舞倦回來而陪着情人一周在大華館裏吃東西一樣的嗎</p>

<p>（戰争與和平）不只是小說這是俄羅斯社會生活的叙事詩拿破侖戰争時代的歷史牠的視野極廣大包含着普通的小說好多篇各個的人們立於廣大的背景之前動着而他們實在是各個各個的人們在那廣大的劇演着主角的四個家族每一人是一個人物托爾斯泰無比地有着性格描寫的天禀他觸到一個人物非使其生動不可而且他有着描寫的力有着場景之感無讑那是戰塲的全景呢還是莫斯科的一家的内部他的故事是擁擠而極複雜的所以然者因爲在那里有極多的興味的交錯點他本能底地遵揗着一個方法那方法他在有的地方稱作原則就在决不勉强地結束故事却任其進行他的（自然主義）不是理論却是他的性質他的心性的表現他是正確地·而且經由物空想底地觀看物的</p>
<p>（戰争與和平）的唯一的缺陷是在牠太過博大唯那博大使其成爲無形態在（安那·卡累泥那）之中視野没有那麽廣大而力則更其集中安那的故事以最大的悲劇的必然性動着她的性格和她的事情像河流向瀑布去一般直瀉地將她運向她的連命去那犯罪的女子爲了漂亮而虚榮心强的戀人背棄可算是冷峻的正直者的完全的檩本的那丈夫於是見到自已旣從厭倦於她的戀人又從她所捨棄的社會割離了她並非由什麽善或惡的抽象的法典却由難以和解的事實的道德而受懲罰在生不再有容納她的地位了於是自殺便是唯一的解决了</p>
<p>作爲對於安那和她的戀人的狂熱的熱情的對照的是雷文和克蒂的家庭生活的平静的故事那書的這一部分不過是和中心悲劇粗疏地相關而已然而因爲雷文和生存的謎相鬭又在宗教底神秘主義裏看出平和正是託爾斯泰本人所以這是重要的託爾斯泰發揮着而且解說着關於倫理·宗教·政治·藝術等等的自已的見解以消磨他那其餘的大部分生涯對於他說過（在現代歐羅巴文學之中他没有能比較者）這話的屠格湼甫以爲託爾斯泰從文學背離的事是不可赦宥的罪然而在託爾斯泰不可赦宥的罪之一却在耽溺於單是文學丨丨就此而言他是過去的巨匠丨丨而他在（藝術是什麽之中便將包含他自已的小說在内的凡有我們所愛的幾乎一切傑作掃到垃圾堆裏去了他到七十歲時有一回復歸於小說寫了（復活）雖然如此他的動機却非藝術底而是實際底爲的是给給基督教的受迫害的一宗派即道珂鮑爾一派籌欵託爾斯泰雖然鄙棄錢財却也喜歡爲了别人而挣錢那書裝滿了太多的道德目的却也顯現着性格描寫和塲景實現的不衰的力在他内中的藝術底精神趁這機會就行了報復靈魂的大勞苦所到逹的託爾斯泰的宗教底信仰是極單純的從宗教底權威和神學底詭辯解放出來的丨照他所解釋丨耶穌的教義就是正教教會恐懼他的勢力於是將他擯出教會檢查他的書籍倒反增加了他的勢力他的宗教思想自然地將他引導到無抵抗與平和底無政府主義了假如他本來是貧苦無名的人那麽他當被送進監獄或放逐到西比利亞去了然而他是比現世的王還强大的文舉之王倘使政府向他下一下辣手則全歐羅巴就會湧起抗議的風潮來的罷因此政府將迫害的手移到他的卑微的追從者身上去致使託爾斯泰陷於無限的悲哀了他死於一九一四年以前也還是好　情哩</p>

<p>林英楣</p>
<p>電氣事業發明於一八八二年歷五年始傅人日本時在明治二十年於是在東京設立電廠以供一般之需要迄今四十餘年矣考其發展過程與世界各國大致相同初創時專供市内電燈之用旣而變壓器發明給電區域較前擴張以及於郊外嗣後電働機（即馬逹）漸次改良足供工業原動力之用於是相率採用需要激增未幾絶錄器發明幾經改良始得實現特别高壓之長距雖送電各大負荷中心遂由此而得互相連絡矣於是規模宏大之發電廠及高壓長度電線亦應連而生即今日之所謂超電力時代是也茲將日本電氣事業之現狀略述如後</p>
<p>發電可能之水力</p>
<p>現有電廠之生產力據照和三年十二月底之調查結果水力發電爲二百四十二萬七千百啓雜華特火力發電爲　百四十二萬三千啓雜華特合計三百八十五萬啓羅華特即水力占百分之六十三强火力占百分之三十七弱日本可供發電之水力據遞信省之調查號稱一千四百萬馬力徵之過去開發之成績若助之以火力發電其發電總量定可增加二倍日本因地理關係雨水較多故能利用水力以供發電之用惟雨量之多寡則隨季節而異故最經濟之辦法莫如水火併用現在火力發電廠之生產力爲一百四十三萬三千啓羅華特但平時使用僅及其半約七十一萬八千啓羅華特其餘則供補助水力之用</p>
<p>日本水力發電地點因地勢上之關係分日本海岸及太平洋沿岸二大地带火力發電廠其容量在七萬啓羅華特以上者則以東京名古屋大阪等處爲中心蓋地臨海口便於運煤也更設十五萬四千伏而次之特别高壓送電線路以連接水火二電日本現有十萬伏而次以上之送電線及連絡線二千六百啓羅米突五萬伏而次以上者四千四百零四啓羅米突至於送電最高壓力現爲十五萬四千伏而次將來輸送更遠之距離時勢必增至二十二萬伏而次以上</p>
<p>給電之分配</p>
<p>昭和二年度給電總量除未滿百啓羅華特之營業自用官用等小電廠外爲百零五億五千八百八十萬啓羅華特時其中關東一带（以東京爲中心）占三十億三千三百萬中部一带（以名古屋爲中心）占九億六千六百九十萬關西一带（以大阪爲中心）占二十六億三千九百六十萬啓羅華特時上述三大負荷中心區域合計六十六億三千九百五十萬即總額之六十三%若以全國平均計算之每人約占一百七十二啓羅華特時如依區域計算之則以關西爲最大每人約占二百八十四北陸次之爲二百二十八中部爲二百零六關東爲二百啓羅華特時更將上述三大區域以人口集中之工業地带區别之則得下列之結果</p>

<p>電燈用電</p>
<p>昭和二年年底電燈用户總數爲一千零五十四萬七千二百三十五家占全國户口總數百分之八十八電燈盞數爲三千二百三十二萬二千九百九十一只其耗費電力爲七十三萬六千一百六十九啓羅華特平均每家約占燈數三一盞耗電六九七華特日本家用電燈之發逹普及考其原因約有下列二端（一）電費包額制度（二）屋内電線及其他用具之租借制度以優待小用户徵之世界各國其普及程度在日本之上者厥惟瑞士而已</p>
<p>至於工業用電在昭和二年年底時原動力方面有馬逹三十三萬九千七百四十一只其馬力數爲二百四十萬四千六百四十四（百七十九萬三千八百五十九啓羅華特）原動力以外用於化學工業方面者四十四萬六千三百二十六啓羅華特合計二百二十四萬零八十五啓羅華特</p>
<p>電氣之將來需要</p>
<p>家用電熱最近漸趨發逹昭和元年年底全國用户約有十萬六千七百零八家耗電十二萬七千三百四十工啓羅華特將來生活方式改良電熱需要必無限量也農業用電近年亦呈發逹之象試觀昭和三年年底之狀况於後原動力方面計有馬逹二萬零四百九十三只馬力七萬三千九百六十五四電熱方面爲二千八百五十七啓羅華特殺蟲器及其他農業應用之電燈總數爲八萬九千零八十八盞其容量爲一千六百六十一啓羅華特電風及其他爲六十七啓羅華特合計總容量爲五萬九千七百六十四啓羅華特電氣鐵道及鐵道電氣化之耗電量昭和元午度時電車（直流）爲四億四千三百四十二萬三千啓羅華特時鐵道電氣化（六流）爲一億三千一百八十七萬一千啓羅華特時若以年增九十萬啓羅華特時計算之則昭和三年度之消耗量恐將逹</p>
<p>七億五千萬至八億啓羅華特時</p>
<p>電氣事業與收支</p>
<p>日本經營電業者昭和二年年底時合計七百二十八家其中六百二十八家屬於公司經營百家屬於公共團體而此百家中由縣市經營規模較大者僅大阪東京等十處而已大部分均散於鄕僻村鎭規模極少可見日本電氣事業太半操於私人之手全數七百二十八家中資本額在五千萬元以上者十五家一億元以上者六家</p>
<p>昭和二年年底時資本總額號稱三十億二千四百二十萬元其中繳足資本額爲二十六億七千七百二十萬元負債額爲八億八千八百五十萬元借欵爲六億一千七百五十萬圓固定資本總額爲三十六億六千七百四十萬元繳足資本金負債及借欵三項合計四十一億八千三百二十萬元超過固定資本額凡五億一千五百八十萬元其中大部多爲各大公司投資於其附屬機關</p>
<p>同年之總收人額爲七億六千三百五十六萬餘元等於固定資本之二○·八％除總支出額四億八千四百零二萬元外尙餘純利二億七千九百五十六萬元約等繳足資本之一○·五％</p>
<p>近來日本各種實業盛倡合理化電氣事業自不能獨異故亦漸趨於大規模化以提高能率統一管理旣可增進資本運用能力復能推廣招倈何樂而不爲</p>

The British ambassador's intention is to formally notify both the North and South that the Northern warring factions have been established. A cable was sent to London for instructions and a reply was received for the consular corps to handle the matter as circumstances warrant, as there is no guarantee that the agreement not to wage war can be ensured. It is expected that the British and Japanese will soon invite ministers from countries with citizens residing in Jinan to discuss the matter, but it will not be convened by the consular corps. (5th dispatch)</p>

<p>Xu Yuanquan Urges Ji, Zhang, and Hei Wan</p>
<h3 id="e5">Hoping for Northeast Troops to Move Into Shanhaiguan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: A telegram from Luohe, Xu Yuanquan to Zhang Zuoxiang and Wan Fulin on the 3rd (Omitted above). Time passes quickly, and the seasons flow. I often think of your virtuous efforts. The late General Zhang Zuolin's campaign against the Red Army was unfinished when he perished. Now, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan are colluding with the communists to create chaos, causing turmoil throughout the country. President Jiang Kai-shek could not bear to see the divine land of China fall into the hands of the communists, so he raised the banner of righteousness, vowing to eliminate the traitors. His intention is in line with General Zhang's intention to fight the Reds. The army has been mobilized for a month, and the Jin army on the Longhai Line has been almost completely annihilated, with few survivors. The troops between Zhengzhou, Bian (Kaifeng), Xuchang, and Ye (County) have also suffered repeated setbacks, and their elite forces have been wiped out. At the moment, President Jiang Kai-shek is personally leading the army, taking advantage of the victory to press on to Daliang (Kaifeng). He Xuetang (He Chengjun) is commanding me and others to besiege Xuchang and Zhengzhou, sweeping away the enemy like leaves in the wind, and we are winning every battle. In the end, they may flee to Hebei and hold on to their positions. Recent reports indicate that there are only five brigades maintaining order in the Tianjin and Beiping area, which is precarious and causing widespread fear. Many are hoping that the Northeast troops will move into Shanhaiguan (Great Wall) to reduce the casualties of the war. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I am secretly reporting this to you. If you two can urge Zhang Xueliang to immediately order troops to advance west, Tianjin and Beiping can be pacified without a fight. This would be a great achievement. In the past, the Northeast entered Shanhaiguan three times, which was considered a mistake by many. However, times have changed, and today, for the sake of restoring General Zhang's honor in fighting the Reds, it is appropriate to quickly raise the army to punish the guilty and comfort the people.

<p>Financial Authorities Investigate</p>
<h3 id="e10">Inside Story of Soaring Gold Prices <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Controlled by Inland Gold Merchants</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu Expresses Opinion</p>
<p>Nanjing: Due to the soaring gold prices in recent days, the financial authorities' investigation revealed that this price surge is not related to the global rise in gold prices. Instead, it is manipulated by inland gold merchants. General speculators believe that the amount of gold currently available in China is insufficient to support gold transactions, and the import of gold is also very scarce. Therefore, they are artificially raising the spot prices to hoard and speculate. This is only a temporary phenomenon and cannot last long. Therefore, although some people have suggested stopping gold transactions, the authorities are aware that while they can stop the official market, they cannot crack down on the black market. Currently, they have not actively considered this proposal. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Executive Yuan previously intended to implement a 30% tax on the import of silver, but this has now been abandoned. They are preparing to implement a progressive tax of 20% on the import of silver, which may be able to suppress some of the rise in gold prices. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Ma Yinchu commented on the gold price issue: banning the export of gold and the import of silver coins are not appropriate measures. The only solution is to consult with other countries to temporarily suspend the import of raw silver into China and to ask other countries to mint more silver subsidiary currency to maintain the status of silver. At the same time, actively prepare for the adoption of the gold standard and as a transition to implementing the gold standard. (5th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Hidden Worries in the World's Economic Sphere <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the high value of gold and the low value of silver, along with the economic chaos in China, has become a common topic. But this is only part of the issue. I have often said that the world's economic chaos will first affect industrialized countries. Industrialized countries, due to the development of industry, have factories everywhere and a large number of workers. Furthermore, due to advanced machinery, output is increasing day by day. Once commercial depression occurs, there will be excessive inventory. It is difficult to sell the goods, but the factories must continue to operate. If they continue to operate, the inventory will increase and the value will decrease. How can capitalists bear this? If they do not operate or reduce their operations, the number of unemployed workers will increase day by day. Even those who are not unemployed will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. In this way, disputes between capitalists and workers are bound to arise. This is an inevitable trend. A Berlin dispatch mentions the hidden worries in the German economic sphere, which is related to this.</p>
<p>Due to the economic decline in Germany, various parties are competing to tighten their belts, which will likely lead to large-scale strikes. According to capitalists, wages must be reduced by 5% to 30% in order to maintain operations. According to workers, the cost of living is constantly increasing, and there are many unemployed, so it is difficult to further reduce wages. Both sides are telling the truth, and neither side can compromise. Therefore, even if labor leaders negotiate with employers, there is no way to resolve the issue through negotiation. If negotiations fail, there will inevitably be strikes, but strikes cannot solve the problem either. This is an unresolvable issue for both sides. Germany is the most industrialized country, so it sees this phenomenon first. Many countries will follow Germany and experience this phenomenon.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Sixth Mongolian Conference <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Proposals Discussion Completed</p>
<p>Each Group Begins Reviewing</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Mongolian Conference held its sixth meeting at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. Forty-one people were present, including the presidium and representatives. Fifteen representatives were in attendance. Kong Xiangxi presided over the meeting. 1. Regarding the qualifications of the Qinghai representatives who have reported and whether they should be allowed to attend, it was resolved that the chairman would appoint Ma Fuxiang, Zhang Wohua, Wu Heling, Chen Xiaofan, and Badan as a review committee to review their supporting documents. Their qualifications will be discussed after they are determined. 2. Dai Qinglian temporarily proposed a motion to amend the second clause of the Zhe League representative Ge Minggu's proposal, which was passed the day before regarding religious matters, to add the word "Mongolian" above the words "but lamas are not allowed to interfere in politics" or add parentheses below the line "This clause is limited to the Mongolian side" to clarify its distinction from Tibet. It was resolved to further amend the proviso of the seventh case of the fourth meeting to the fourteen words "but Mongolian lamas without banners are not allowed to interfere in politics." After the discussion, the agenda for the day was followed and discussed. 1. The Ministry of Interior proposed a draft of temporary laws for the Mongolian and Tibetan regions. It was resolved to pass it, but all old Mongolian and Tibetan laws and regulations will be temporarily allowed to be applied before the new Mongolian and Tibetan code is promulgated. 2. The Anti-Opium Association proposed that the name of the unified administrative division of Outer Mongolia be established. It was resolved to hand it over to the first group for review. 3. The Anti-Opium Association proposed to reward inland talents to go to Mongolia to serve. It was resolved to pass it in general and hand it over to the secretariat to amend the wording. 4. The Ministry of Interior proposed to support the Mongolian people to improve their lives in order to gradually move towards a harmonious society. It was resolved to pass the first to sixth proposals and cancel the seventh to ninth proposals. 5. Wu Heling and others proposed to send the Panchen Lama back to Tibet. It was resolved to pass the proposal to add the word "suggestion" below the return to Tibet. 6. Wu Heling and others proposed to stipulate the number of Mongolian representatives in the provincial committees of the Mongolian border provinces. It was resolved to hand it over for review. 7. Li Peitian and others proposed to organize a Mongolian-Tibetan Transportation Company proposal. It was resolved to hand it over for review. At this point, the chairman announced that the various proposals of the conference had been completed. Group review meetings will be held in the morning and afternoon of the 6th and the morning of the 7th, hoping to expedite the work and complete the review so that a report can be presented to the conference for discussion on the afternoon of the 7th. If one conference cannot be completed, the conference will be extended once to ensure thoroughness. (5th dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Northern Party-Government Dispute <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Factions Still Difficult to Reconcile</p>
<p>Beiping: Yesterday, Tan Zhen visited Zhao Pilian and then invited Chen Gongbo to meet. Zhao requested another meeting to be held within the day, hoping to only issue a joint declaration and not issue declarations from the Guangdong and Shanghai factions. Chen said that he had to telegraph Wang Jingwei for instructions. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Xie Zou replied to Wang Jingwei that the Guangdong Second National Congress had expired and was invalid, and that the party's orthodoxy had long been broken. If you had followed the Xishan faction to clear out the communists in 1925, how could the communist disaster in the southeast have brewed today? If you had cooperated with the Xishan faction in the winter of 1927, how could today's war have been triggered? All these old accounts should no longer be settled. Only by breaking the party's orthodoxy, focusing solely on facts, and supporting the entire party's advocacy can we control the situation. If we talk about party orthodoxy again, causing the government not to be established and delaying the overall situation, who will be responsible? The Shanghai Second National Congress is still willing to discuss appropriate measures based on the spirit of unity to achieve the purpose of establishing a government through a conference. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Chen Gongbo published two general proposals for resolving the party's legitimacy dispute, totaling about 5,000 words. The key points are: If we want to talk about party orthodoxy, we must confirm that the Second National Congress of the Kuomintang on the 15th is not a legal but a factual issue. If we want to talk about extraordinary measures, then simply recognize a center and do not talk about orthodoxy or sessions. This is a way to start over. It is said that specific plans have been prepared for the latter proposal and taken to influential parties to request consultation. If it is considered appropriate, I can only stand aside and reflect on myself. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: After Xie Zou sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei, he simultaneously issued a general telegram on the 5th, saying that Wang Jingwei still insists on the orthodoxy of the Second National Congress, which is regrettable. In today's discussions on the party, we must observe the support of the people, consider the military environment, and realize the need to eliminate factionalism. Therefore, Commander Yan has the whole party's advocacy. We must know that without breaking the party's orthodoxy, we cannot achieve whole unity. The expansion of the conference can be opened to return the party's rights to party members and the political power to the people. It is hoped that all comrades will work together to achieve this.

<p>Peasants and Laborers Revolt Against the Government</p>
<p>Unstable Situation in Coastal Areas</p>
<p>Troops Stationed at Wai-Hai Raise White Flags and Release Prisoners</p>
<p>Part of the Red Army in Boli Also Mutinies</p>
<p>The following is a dispatch from the Datong News Agency, Harbin, dated the 4th, regarding the aftermath of the peasant and laborer uprisings in the coastal areas of Russia: A team of Red bandits attacked Genengji along the Ussuri Railway, killing several officials and stealing a large number of horses from the local state-run pastures before fleeing. The residents of Geluotegefu (mostly Cossacks) and other residents of tribes along the Ussuri-Boli line, seeing the unstable situation, gradually sought refuge in safe areas, leaving most houses empty. Peasants and laborers in other areas, such as Siqiya, Xige Duohua, Wugeli Laya, Nige Lisi Gusi Langsiji, Geluote Ge Weiya, and Genengji, also rose up in revolt against the government. Local officials and Communist Party members, feeling their lives were in danger, fled to places such as Boli and Ladi Kesuotegu. In the Sucheng coal mine area, two prominent Red bandits led a mutinous group to revolt against the officials, with slogans such as "Confirm the land ownership of peasants," "Give bread to laborers," "Give freedom to the people," and "Abolish the National Security Department system." Their power is not to be underestimated. Furthermore, the people of Vladivostok are agitated. Thousands of anti-government activists escorted from various places to Vladivostok have been exiled to areas along the sea route to Gamsariya. As a result, a part of the Red Navy stationed in Vladivostok raised a white flag, seized transport ships, clashed with officials, and released 30,000 prisoners in the nearby area who were resisting the government. A portion of the Boli Red Army also launched a mutiny. Government offices have been moved from Vladivostok and other locations, and the Red Army has been sent to suppress the rebellion. However, the power of the rebellion is increasing daily, mainly due to the extreme shortage of supplies, causing laborers and peasants to clash with officials everywhere.</p>

Thirty textile mills have closed, and 65,000 workers are on strike and marching. Some strikers threw stones at a factory, forcing the workers to withdraw. Police who intervened were also pelted with stones. Another 3,000 workers gathered in front of a factory to demonstrate, but were dispersed by the police.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Simla, dated the 4th, states: The Viceroy, speaking to a delegation of thirty Muslim landlords from Benjerb, addressed the issue of the Muslim demand for expanded provincial autonomy. He stated that the government would never ignore the legitimate demands of Muslims in Benjerb and other minority groups throughout India. Although there is a non-violent resistance movement, he is still willing to promote great progress in the constitution. It would be very beneficial to India if the Indian people were prepared to cooperate with the government to achieve this goal and encouraged their fellow countrymen to adopt this approach. A report from the National Society, Bombay, dated the 4th, states: The most serious development in the current Indian situation is the large-scale march of Muslims in support of the national movement. This move, initiated by the Muslims themselves, is extremely noteworthy. The British army is currently using artillery to bombard the Red Shirts in the mountains of North Xiaohua, as these individuals are hiding deep in the mountains, making it difficult for aircraft to bomb effectively.</p>

<p>Difficult Life Makes Wage Reductions Hard to Consider</p>
<p>Communists Seize the Opportunity to Advocate Strikes</p>
<p>A dispatch from the National Society, Berlin, dated the 4th, states: Germany is currently experiencing an economic downturn, and various parties are seeking austerity measures, which may lead to a large-scale strike. Individuals in the industrial and financial sectors are quite anxious. The capital side claims that wages must be reduced by 5% to 30% to maintain operations and avoid bankruptcy. However, the labor side argues that the cost of living continues to rise, and with the large number of unemployed, it is difficult to reduce wages further. Currently, union leaders are negotiating with employers to avoid a serious dispute, but Communists are seizing the opportunity to advocate strikes, claiming that this is the only effective way to remedy the situation. Major strikes have already occurred in Königsberg and Mengerte Along. Miners and ironworkers in the Ruhr and dockworkers in Hamburg may also strike soon.</p>

<p>Establishment of the Administrative Refreshment Committee</p>
<p>Proceeding According to Three Major Principles</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Datong News Agency, Tokyo, dated the 5th, states: The Administrative Refreshment Committee submitted a cabinet resolution yesterday to establish a committee consisting of the Prime Minister and other officials. As a result of the committee's deliberations, it was unanimously agreed to proceed according to the following three major principles: (1) Revise the pension law. (2) Simplify and rationalize the administrative system. (3) Reform the official system and abolish dual supervision. Some committee members proposed merging the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, as well as merging the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications. The extent to which these goals can be achieved remains to be seen. The first meeting will be held at the end of this week.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Plot to Expand Military Preparations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Military Establishes a New National Defense Plan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Plans to Adopt a Tough Stance</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Japan Union News Agency, Tokyo, dated the 5th, states: The Military General Staff, citing the lack of troop strength, has established a large-scale new national defense plan and is about to make new demands. The authorities at the Ministry of Finance plan to adopt a tough stance against this demand, which contradicts the spirit of the disarmament conference. The top priority for the use of funds saved from military cuts is tax reduction, and the issue of replenishing troop strength will only be handled to the minimum extent possible.</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Datong News Agency, Tokyo, dated the 5th, states: The military is preparing concrete plans to strengthen national defense and compensate for the deficiencies in troop strength resulting from the London Treaty. According to their investigation, in order to supplement the submarine force greatly reduced by the London Treaty, the following are absolutely necessary: 1. Establishment of a large-scale air force of twenty units. 2. Construction of replacement submarines. 3. Construction of aircraft carriers. The construction costs for this plan are 80 million yen more than the original plan, and the annual maintenance costs are 50 million yen more. According to this plan, the amount of money the navy requires to supplement the deficiencies in national defense is very large, making it difficult to use the remaining funds to reduce the national burden.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Optimism in the Japanese-Treasury Secretary's Market Outlook <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Slump Is Temporary</p>
<p>Shutdowns in American Mines Could Curb Silver Price Declines</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Datong News Agency, Tokyo, dated the 5th, states: The stock market and commodity markets worsened yesterday due to the global economic slump, the sharp decline in silver prices, the continued decline in raw cotton prices, and the poor export of raw silk. Treasury Secretary Inoue has consistently rejected pessimistic arguments from all sides, forcefully arguing that the final recovery will naturally occur soon. He stated that when the market deteriorates, psychological factors amplify the situation, leading to a downward spiral. There is no way to remedy this. For example, the simultaneous decline of raw silk prices in Yokohama and New York is currently irreversible, but once the prices rebound, the market prices will rise rapidly. With the new silk coming onto the market in July, buyers will be enthusiastic, and there will be a turnaround. Although cotton yarn and cloth are affected by the fall in silver prices, inventories in consumer areas are limited, and exports are expected to increase within days. The decline in silver prices is somewhat excessive due to artificial factors. If it falls below twenty pence, many silver mines in the United States will have to shut down, which can curb the decline. Some domestic prices have already fallen to the lowest level, while others still have room to fall. The future decline will simply be the latter following the former. If general morale can be restored, the current slump will be only temporary, and there is no need to be overly pessimistic.</p>

<p>British Ambassador to the Holy See Has Returned to London</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London, dated the 5th, states: The Foreign Office has released a Blue Book on the Malta political-religious dispute, consisting of ninety-five pages and containing official documents exchanged with the Holy See over the past eighteen months. The Foreign Office stated that the actions of the Holy See amounted to interference in the internal affairs of a British colony. It is particularly absurd to say that ordinary friendship cannot be restored as long as a person who disrupts peace is in power. The Holy See has even regarded the envoy (Lord Strickland), who administers political affairs in accordance with the British territory's constitution, as an unrecognized diplomatic representative. The British government believes that this is incompatible with friendly diplomatic relations. The British ambassador to the Holy See has returned to London, and only a deputy envoy remains stationed there.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Ministry of Propaganda Reception for the Press <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a briefing for journalists at the Central Second Conference Hall at 2:00 PM on the 5th. More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Liu Luyin, chairman, reported as follows: (1) Yan Xishan sent people to contact the Japanese in Taicang to negotiate loans and purchase military equipment, using certain privileges as collateral. A draft agreement has been reached between the two parties. In addition, Feng Yuxiang sent Ding to buy off various Japanese news agencies, and negotiations have been completed. Therefore, in the past ten days, Japanese newspapers have vigorously promoted Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, while launching reckless attacks on the Central Government. (2) Recently, Japanese newspapers, having been bought off by Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, have been publishing news that is detrimental to the Central Government. For example, the Japan Union News Agency recently claimed that Lu Zhonglin had defeated the Central Army and that Pang Bingxun had defeated the Central Army near Xuchang. At the same time, they also claimed that the Central Army was still fiercely fighting Fan Zhongxiu near Linying, and made various frivolous speculations. Furthermore, the Mainichi Shimbun extensively promoted the Guizhou Army's incursion into Hunan, claiming that Changsha had been lost and speculating that the situation in Shandong was extremely dangerous. All kinds of counter-propaganda are actually extremely peaceful in Shandong, with only slight contact in western Shandong. Even that is not very tense. Linying has also long been recovered by the Central Army. It can be seen that all the news reported by Japanese newspapers is reactionary propaganda that is not worth the attention of those who know the truth. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek and Commander Xiong Shihui in Shanghai are paying close attention to this kind of rumor-mongering news. The Central Government is also trying to advise Japanese newspapers against spreading rumors. If these newspapers continue to spread rumors arbitrarily, they will be subject to appropriate sanctions. (3) The areas recovered by the Central Army this time have been plundered by Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan, leaving starving people everywhere. The Central Standing Committee decided today to launch a campaign through party departments and social organizations at home and abroad to raise large sums of money to provide relief to the war-stricken people in the war zones to show sympathy. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Conversation on the Evolution of the Darhan Banner in Inner Mongolia <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Talks with Duke Serla, Assistant to the State</p>
<p>The entire banner has a population of only over thirty thousand</p>
<p>Half Relying on Nomadism, Half Relying on Farming</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch on the 29th reports: Duke Serla Hawangjur, assistant to the state of the Korchin Left Wing Middle Banner in Inner Mongolia, passed through Harbin yesterday on his way to Liaoning. The Darhan Banner is a prosperous area in Jerim League, and its agricultural industry, education, and administrative development have made it the crown of Inner Mongolia in recent years. The reporter visited Serla at the New World this afternoon to discuss the situation in the banner as follows: (1) The border of this banner extends from Sipingjie in the south to Tongliao Nimagong in the north, from Kairu in the west to Fanjia Tun in the east, including the Solun Mountains, covering an area of about 30,000 square miles. (2) The population of the Mongolian banners has gradually assimilated into the Han Chinese, so that the pure Mongolian race is becoming increasingly rare. Currently, the entire banner has approximately 30,000 households. (3) Jurisdiction: All residents residing within this banner, their litigation, industrial and commercial operations, life, and property are under the jurisdiction of this banner. (4) Taxes are entirely collected by the county government, but 20% is allocated to this banner for office expenses. For other special taxes, this banner receives 40%. (5) The office location of this banner and the office location of the Duke of State Assistance are located at Wendugai in Liaoyuan, where the Korchin Prince's Mansion is located, 70 miles from Tongliao, which is the Darhan Prince's Mansion. (6) Marriage: In the past, during the Qing Dynasty, intermarriage between Mongols and Hans was considered forbidden, but now the boundaries have been removed, and Hans and Mongols can marry freely. (7) Language: All banners affiliated with Darhan have a special relationship with the former Marshal Zhang, so they pay special attention to the language of the Han Chinese. Currently, 90% of the entire banner speaks Chinese, and it is expected that all will speak Chinese within ten years. (8) Education: Before the tenth year of the Republic, this banner still read Mongolian script, but after the tenth year of the Republic, realizing that Mongolian script was not suitable, Han-Mongolian schools were established in all cities and towns of the Daqi to enable all people to learn Han Chinese. The original Mongolian schools also added instruction in Han Chinese. Daqi education can be completely assimilated into Han Chinese in about 20 years. (9) Industry: This matter is not yet discussed in this banner, because the habit of the entire Daqi is to live by nomadism, which is the so-called industry of this banner. Recently, because there is nothing to roam, most of the people have opened up land for cultivation, which is the so-called improved nomadism industry. As for others, there is no establishment. (10) Commerce: The commercial center is completely controlled by the Han Chinese. In addition to nomadism and farming, the people of this banner have no business operators. (11) Industry: Approximately 70% of industry belongs to the Han Chinese, and 30% belongs to the Mongols. The Mongols only make crude agricultural implements. (12) The security of this banner has always been provided by the security guerrillas organized and well-trained by this banner. Even if there are Han bandits, they dare not covet it. In short, the entire situation of Daqi strives for progress. For example, in the education project, new textbooks on the Three Principles of the People are planned to be added. Factories are planned to be established for industry. Other things are also striving to improve. The purpose of my visit this time is purely to investigate the situation in various places in order to learn from them and achieve further evolution.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The Explosion at the Jinan Ammunition Depot <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Casualties is Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Approximately Several Hundred Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>The ammunition depot inside Jinan Communications City, by Daming Lake, suddenly exploded one evening with a thunderous sound. Those who were unaware of the true situation were shocked and doubtful. Here is a detailed account of the circumstances:</p>
<p>Location and History of the Depot: There are two ammunition depots within Jinan City, by Daming Lake. One is west of Beiji Pavilion, facing east, and the other, the site of the incident, is east of Beimen (the North Gate, which is a water gate, is closed year-round and has a building above it called "Bo"). This one is called the East Depot. It has few buildings and mainly stores discarded ammunition. A platoon of soldiers from the 11th Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment of the Shandong Garrison Brigade is stationed there for guard duty. Outside, there are two depot guards. To the east of this depot is Xiaobeimen, which has long been blocked up. There is also a Shuiyue Nunnery, where the Third Outpost of the Second Public Security Bureau in the city is stationed, with fourteen police officers. These two ammunition depots originally belonged to the Jinan Arsenal in the new city. Last month, the arsenal of the General Headquarters (Hong Zi Ao) stored a large amount of lead from ammunition sold during the late Qing Dynasty. Since it was neither destroyed nor had a place to be stored, it was discussed with the arsenal to temporarily store it there. It is said that a total of one million pounds of old black powder, three to four hundred thousand rounds of bullets and lead pellets, more than twenty landmines, and an unknown number of mortar shells were stored.</p>
<p>City-wide Curfew During the Explosion: At 8:45 PM on the first day, the sky was gloomy. Suddenly, sparks burst out from the northern part of the city, followed by a deafening roar. The roof tiles of the entire city shook, and thick smoke billowed straight up. A strong wind rose suddenly, and soon after, a series of cannon-like sounds rumbled, numbering more than a dozen. The people on the streets suspected a great disaster was imminent and fled in panic. All the shops closed, and the cries of women and children were mixed in, creating great disorder. Several minutes later, the Garrison Headquarters learned that it was the ammunition depot that had exploded. However, they did not know if there were any survivors inside, so they ordered a special curfew. All the garrison brigade troops, Public Security Bureau police, and others were dispatched to cut off traffic. The military police in the east city were so close to the ammunition depot that they did not know the real situation after the explosion. Some even lay on the ground holding their guns, ready to fire. The seriousness of the situation was unprecedented. At 9:30 PM, the third passenger train on the Jiaoji Railway arrived in Jinan. Passengers disembarked, but since they could not walk on the streets, they all slept in the station. At this time, Garrison Commander Shi Zhongcheng led his troops to the scene to investigate and maintain order. Public Security Bureau Chief Li Yue also led the fire brigade and security team to put out the remaining fire. Chief of Staff Li Zhongkang of the General Headquarters and Jinan Mayor Zhao Jingshi also arrived to inspect the scene. Afterwards, people were sent to guard it. Although the cause of the incident is unknown, it is the responsibility of the ammunition depot officer, Wang Keming, who failed to inspect properly. He will be placed in custody.</p>
<p>Public Notice to Reassure the People After the Incident: From the explosion at 8:45 PM until about 10:00 PM, the cause became clear, and the situation on the streets eased slightly. The Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau both issued public notices to reassure the people. However, it was already the time of the regular curfew, and there was no one on the streets. The Garrison Headquarters' notice stated: "At 8:00 PM today, a sudden explosion occurred. It was the ammunition stored in the ammunition depot east of Beiji Pavilion that exploded due to hot weather. There are no other circumstances. This notice is issued to inform all merchants and residents to be aware and not to panic. This notice." The Jinan Public Security Bureau's notice stated: "At 8:30 PM this evening, the Eastern Ammunition Depot of the ordnance depot at Xiaobeimen accidentally exploded, causing ammunition to detonate. The fire has now been extinguished, and there is no danger. This notice is issued to inform all to be aware and not to panic or cause disturbances. Strictly this notice."</p>
<p>Losses and Aftermath: This morning (the 2nd), the military cleared the site of the incident and investigated the losses. It was determined that only gunpowder, bullets, and the like had exploded. Fortunately, the twenty landmines did not ignite, otherwise, the situation would have been even more unimaginable. The ammunition depot buildings were all destroyed. The buildings of the Shuiyue Nunnery to the east were also toppled. Two ammunition depot guards were killed, and seven were seriously injured. It was said that the depot soldiers who were sleeping indoors that night were all killed by the explosion. Some bodies were thrown so far by the force of the explosion that they could not be found. Those who were outdoors were mostly unharmed. Out of the twelve police officers at the Shuiyue Nunnery, except for four who were on duty, the remaining eight who were indoors were all injured. The Baiyi Nunnery south of the ammunition depot also had people seriously injured. In addition, in nearby Lishan Street, a 21-year-old woman surnamed Wang who had just given birth was holding her baby. That evening, both her legs were blown off by the shells, and the baby's head was half blown off. Mother and child both died without medical attention. In the vicinity of the ammunition depot, such as Beiji Pavilion Street and Lishan Street, seven or eight out of ten houses collapsed. Only a few remained. Many houses were also destroyed in areas such as Zhang Gong祠, San Gong祠, Huibo Temple Street, He Sheng Battleground, and Qiuyayuan, numbering no less than several hundred. Many people were crushed and injured. The number is still under detailed investigation. It was said that when the explosion occurred, lake water overflowed onto the shore. However, Huibo Tower, which is only five zhang away from the ammunition depot, was unharmed, which is also a miracle. Today, the provincial government held a memorial week for the Premier. Acting Chairman Zhu Xi reported on the incident and said that those who were killed and injured would be compensated. The Provincial Consolidation Committee will handle this matter. The detailed arrangements have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Conflicting Accounts of the Cause of the Explosion: At the time of the incident, some suspected it was the work of the enemy, but this has now been proven incorrect. As for the cause, there are various rumors. Those who were at the scene were either dead or seriously injured, making it impossible to inquire. Some say that the gunpowder had been stored for many years and should have been destroyed. It seemed unsuitable for destroying enemies, yet it was not useless. If it was stored improperly, it was more than enough to explode. The gunpowder was stored in iron boxes, but the boxes were damaged. Then, wooden boxes were added, but the wooden boxes were also damaged. Now, it is mostly packed in sacks. Although it does not matter if the sacks are old, it is most important to avoid sacks that have contained salt because gunpowder explodes when it comes into contact with salt. It is possible that some of these sacks contained salt. This is one theory. Some say that the guards and depot soldiers, numbering over a dozen, were too many, and some must have had a habit of smoking cigarettes, causing a fire. This is the second theory. Others say that when storing gunpowder, cold water must be poured on it when the weather gets too hot to a certain degree. Recently, the weather in Jinan has been hot and dry. The depot soldiers may have forgotten to pour water because that day was the old Dragon Boat Festival, and they were drinking and celebrating. This led to the explosion. This is the third theory. Based on the circumstances, the latter theory seems more likely. (June 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Shen Honglie Arrives in Qingdao to Inspect Defense <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Shen Honglie, Commander of the Northeast Navy in Qingdao, arrived in Laoshan Bay from Changshan Island on the 26th of last month. He has been inspecting the defense situation there for several days. Now that he has finished, he returned to Qingdao on the Haihe warship on the 30th and convened a naval defense conference at the headquarters that evening, gathering important personnel from the department and captains of the various ships stationed in Qingdao to discuss coastal defense. On the 1st of this month, Shen took advantage of a Sunday and specially invited the consuls of the four countries of Britain, America, France, and Germany to travel to Laoshan on the Zhenhai warship to visit various scenic spots. He returned to Qingdao on the same warship that evening. I (Fool) went to the Naval Headquarters to meet him today (2nd), but Shen was out. The head of the Naval Qingdao Office, Li Yucheng, received me. Li said the following: "Commander Shen's return to Qingdao this time is purely for inspection purposes. The rumor that Shen will be the mayor of Qingdao is completely unfounded and has no basis. There are currently four ships of the First Fleet stationed in Qingdao, namely, the Haiqi, Haichen, Zhaohe, and Jinghai. The defense of Qingdao is safe and worry-free. A few days ago, the Jiangli warship carried about 150 marines to Dongjiakou and Gongkou to suppress bandits. We have now received a report that the bandits there have been completely eliminated and will be able to return to Qingdao in about 10 days. Also, the Qingyang Station on the Jiaoji Railway originally had a company of marines stationed there. Now, we feel that the force is weak, so we plan to send another company there tomorrow to increase the defense. In this way, the water and land defense will be more consolidated, and the citizens of Qingdao can rest easy. Zhang Xueliang, Commander of the Northeast, has always taken protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people as his duty. The navy's actions will follow Zhang's lead." (June 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Guangzhou Cracks Down on Important Communist Party Organs <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Recently, the Communist Party in Guangdong Province has once again plotted to carry out activities. In addition to the Communist bandits ravaging various places in the Dongjiang region, Communist Party propaganda and printed materials have also been repeatedly discovered in Guangzhou. A few days ago, at a rally held in the playground of Zhongshan University to welcome triumphant soldiers from all walks of life, three young people were arrested by detectives for distributing Communist Party leaflets. On the evening of the 25th, at about 8:00 PM, a long-distance bus from Xihaokou to Yonghan Road in the city was suddenly boarded by more than a dozen people resembling workers. Two of them pulled out guns and pointed them at the driver, while the others scattered a large bundle of reactionary leaflets along the way until they reached a crowded area on Yonghan Road, where they fled one after another. The following evening, near the Wuxianmen of Changdi, several members of the Communist Party stacked no less than several thousand leaflets printed in red ink in a dark corner in front of a store after nightfall. Fearing that people would not notice, they set off a large bundle of firecrackers in the area. After the sound of the firecrackers, passers-by stopped to watch, and only then did they realize that a large number of Communist Party propaganda items had been found there. By the time the detectives arrived, the party members had already fled far away, and they had to collect the printed materials, report the case, and burn them. After repeated discoveries of this kind of incident in the city, the Public Security Bureau paid special attention and, fearing that the Communist Party would take the opportunity to cause trouble during the upcoming anniversary of the May 30th Massacre, ordered the subordinate detective teams to intensify their investigations and interrogate the Communist Party members arrested a few days ago. After learning some clues, on the 27th, based on the report of a secret agent, they discovered various secret organizations formed by senior members sent by Moscow to Guangdong Province. After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau made arrangements overnight to encircle and arrest them in separate ways. Because they were informed that the party was planning to riot on May 30th, they had to quickly take measures to suppress and prevent chaos from arising. That night, several armored vehicles were prepared in front of the Public Security Bureau, and three large security teams divided into three groups to search the addresses. First, they went to Xinfeng Street, behind the corner of the Provincial Government Office, and surrounded the Datong Medical Clinic on that street. The medical clinic was the highest organ of the Guangdong Communist Party organized by the Communist Party. When the troops entered the clinic to search and arrest, the main leaders of the Communist Party were holding a meeting in the secret room of the clinic. More than a dozen members of the party were captured in one fell swoop. The Communist Party also confessed without denial because the matter had been exposed. The most important person was Zhuang, and there were also several female Communist Party members, among whom Chen admitted to being the secretary, and all the leaflets had been drafted by her. The other three were a head of documents and two secretaries. In addition, they seized a total of four large rattan boxes of Communist Party documents and leaflets. That same evening, they also cracked down on the secretarial office and printing press of the Communist Party in a residence in Laojia Alley, Huifudong Road, and seized several male and female Communist Party members. It was found that the Communist Party members arrested this time were rarely young people but were mostly elderly and corrupt. Most of the female party members had bound feet and dressed like servants. At first glance, they were not figures of the new era. From this, it was learned that the party had changed its plan for using personnel in order to conceal them from the outside world. During the interrogation, both male and female Communist Party members wrote their confessions in their own handwriting. Among them, the main leaders could speak Russian, indicating that they were all sent south by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union to carry out activities. (May 31st)</p>
<p>Appendix: The Hong Kong newspaper reported the following: A few days ago, reactionary leaflets were found in Guangzhou in Huangsha, Ruyifang, Xidi, the rooftop of the Daxin Company, and in front of the power company. After the arrest of the Communist Party members at the Triumphant Rally, Liang Ziguang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, believed that since the Communist Party was so rampant, there must be secret Communist Party locations in the city. He specially consulted with Director Ouyang and interrogated the Communist Party members arrested a few days ago at the Xianhu Street Gongxing Hotel and the Old Warehouse Alley Penglai Hotel overnight. After obtaining information about the various Communist Party organs, he and Deputy Captain Yuan Yaoxin led all the team members and armed police of the Security Brigade on the 27th and set off separately to encircle and arrest them at the locations provided. They did not stop until dawn that night, having cracked down on three Communist Party organs: one in the liberal arts dormitory of a certain university, one in the Datong Hospital on Xinfeng Street, and one in the Dajuesi Temple front Luzhou lane, under Yonghan Sub-Bureau. In total, tens of thousands of various reactionary leaflets and several printing presses were seized, along with four female Communist Party members and eight male Communist Party members. All the male Communist Party members were important figures in the Communist Party. The female party members all spoke with a Hainanese accent. Two of them were already over forty years old and had unbound feet. At first glance, they looked like country women. No one expected them to be Communist Party members. One of the youngest, about eighteen or nineteen years old, dressed like a maid and was the secretary of the Communist Party. When the detectives arrived, she was drafting her report to the Provincial Committee. All the Communist Party members confessed without denial after being arrested. The young female Communist Party member even admitted to distributing leaflets on the rooftop of the Daxin Company and that they were also responsible for distributing leaflets in front of the power company a few days ago. However, when they confessed to this point, all the Communist Party members regretted that this move was too radical and had attracted the attention of the authorities, leading to the destruction of the organs.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Hunan Commemorates the June 1st Massacre <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Communication: Seven years have passed since the June 1st Massacre of Changsha citizens by the Japanese warship Fushimi Maru in the twelfth year of the Republic of China. Although the government has repeatedly urged a resolution, the Japanese side has repeatedly delayed it, and the case remains unresolved. The Hunan Provincial Education Association and the Abolish Treaty Association consider this case to be a unique and utter humiliation for the people of Hunan, who are directly oppressed by Japanese imperialists. They have jointly initiated a seventh-anniversary commemoration meeting at 9:30 AM today (June 1st) at the Zhongshan Hall of the Provincial Education Association. More than a thousand representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools attended. After performing the rituals, Chairman Huang Xingyi reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that seven years have passed since the June 1st Massacre. The reason for the massacre was that Japanese imperialists used force to impose the Twenty-One Demands during Yuan Shikai's time, and the people of Hunan implemented an economic boycott against Japan. On the twelfth day, people from all walks of life were giving speeches along the river when the Japanese warship Fushimi Maru, which was docked in Changsha, ordered sailors to land and open fire on the people, killing and injuring more than a dozen people. Our commemoration today should urge the government to resolve this case as soon as possible to comfort the spirits of the dead and avenge the national humiliation. Next, Yang Xuancheng, the former negotiator representing the provincial government, reported that when this case occurred, he was responsible for the negotiations and felt very sad when he thought back. Because this case has been pending for a long time, he not only felt sorry for the deceased but also for the country. When the June 1st Movement occurred, the Japanese wanted him to ban the patriotic actions of the people. He replied that their actions were not out of line and it was inconvenient to ban them. Soon after, the Commercial Port Office reported that Japanese sailors had landed and killed people, so he immediately negotiated with the Japanese and proposed five demands: (1) Punish the murderers; (2) Apologize; (3) Replace the Japanese consul; (4) Withdraw the Japanese warship; (5) Compensate the dead and injured. At that time, the Japanese consul said that since you want to replace me, I am a responsible person and it is inconvenient to negotiate, so there was no result. In the thirteenth year, he went to Beijing to ask the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The Japanese government said that all cases must be resolved together. Our negotiators had already been appointed, but the Japanese side delayed sending theirs, so it was suspended again. In the fourteenth year, the Japanese consul was replaced, and he negotiated with the new consul, Shimizu Hachiichi. In the winter of the fourteenth year, a resolution to mediate was reached, but the Japanese side wanted to avoid the apology. He said at the time that if the compensation was insufficient, our government could make up for it, but the apology was essential. After he left office in the fifteenth year, the situation was not very clear. His successor, Mr. Gong Debei, negotiated in various ways but could not get a result. Today, we hope that all comrades know why foreigners can kill our Chinese people with impunity and why foreign warships can come to China. This is because the former diplomats did not understand their responsibilities and feared foreigners. Therefore, he hoped that the Chinese people would not give up their rights again. Next, Zhang Jiong of the Provincial Party Committee spoke, hoping that everyone would work together to abolish unequal treaties and implement an economic boycott, fundamentally stopping the use of foreign goods. After the speeches, the chairman put forward the draft telegram for voting. The entire body passed it and then shouted slogans and dispersed. Appendix: The telegram is as follows: "The June 1st Massacre in Hunan is the most poisonous and evil fact of Japanese imperialists violating international law and harming our Chinese nation, and it is also one of the most shameful and tragic commemorations in Hunan. Seven years have passed since the occurrence of this case, but there has been no appropriate resolution. Today is the seventh anniversary of the June 1st Massacre. The representatives of our association, representing the people of Hunan, held a commemorative meeting at the Provincial Education Association at 9:00 AM this morning. More than seven speakers successively spoke about the tragedy and its suspension. The crowds were indignant and unanimously proposed to send a telegram to the central Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the provincial government to seriously negotiate with the Japanese side based on the five demands of the people of Hunan and resolve the June 1st Massacre as soon as possible. We also hope that the people of Hunan and compatriots from all provinces will unite and rise up to support the resolution of the June 1st Massacre in order to avenge the shame of the people of Hunan and comfort the souls of the martyrs who died on June 1st. The Provisional Telegram cannot express the extent of our indignation." (June 1st)</p>

<p>Implementing Checks on Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Taiyuan Communication: Recently, due to speculation and disruption of finance, prices have soared and foreign exchange rates have risen in the city of Jin, with remittances to Pingjin reaching more than 330 yuan. The entire city is in a state of panic. The authorities decided at a meeting a few days ago that the Finance Department, the Industry and Commerce Department, the Jin-Cha-Sui Gendarmerie Headquarters, the Taiyuan Public Security Bureau, and the Taiyuan General Chamber of Commerce should jointly organize a Foreign Exchange Inspection Committee to conduct inspections in various ways. Yesterday, an order was issued for the immediate start of inspections of various foreign exchange institutions. The document stated: "Recently, the value of provincial notes has fallen sharply, and foreign exchange rates have risen sharply, which has a great impact on the city's finances. After careful consideration, the cause is that merchants and residents are remitting foreign exchange without any restrictions, leading to this situation. Inspections should be carried out immediately to prevent disruption. It has been decided that the Finance Department, the Industry and Commerce Department, the Jin-Cha-Sui Gendarmerie Headquarters, the Taiyuan Public Security Bureau, and the Taiyuan General Chamber of Commerce should jointly organize a Foreign Exchange Inspection Committee to conduct strict inspections. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the agreed-upon rules is attached for your compliance. The Finance Department should convene and establish a committee to report for the record and quickly begin inspections." The following are the rules for inspecting foreign exchange: (1) The Foreign Exchange Inspection Committee shall be organized by the following agencies: 1. Finance Department, 2. Industry and Commerce Department, 3. Gendarmerie Headquarters, 4. Public Security Bureau, 5. General Chamber of Commerce. (2) All foreign exchange remittances must be inspected by the committee and stamped with approval. The stamp must be signed by the five agencies in the preceding article separately to ensure verification. (3) Those who remit foreign exchange without inspection and approval by the committee will have their entire amount confiscated and the remitter and the remitting merchant will be punished for violating the order. (4) These rules shall take effect from the date of promulgation. (May 29th)</p>

<p>Shenxiang Town Robbed by Bandits: Shenxiang Town, located in the 34th Tu of the 43rd Bao of the Tianma Mountain area in the county, is a small town near the Huating River, bordering Qingpu County. On the afternoon of the 4th, more than 40 bandits with mixed accents suddenly came, driving several bandit boats, each holding weapons. They entered the town and committed robbery. First, they dispatched bandits to guard the four sides of the town and then began to rob, searching house by house for an hour before taking the loot and fleeing. Before leaving, they kidnapped Wu Xianglin (owner of Yuanshun Xie store), Liu Shouzhi and his son Qitao, Ye Sansheng, and Cheng Musheng, forcing them onto the bandit boats and heading towards Nanmao. The amount of losses is unknown.</p>
<p>Accused of Falsehood, Wronged to Death by Poison: Wang Cao, wife of Wang Jinzhang of Pujiang, East Suburb, has recently been falsely insulted by her neighbor Chu Guo in foul language, and even assaulted and harassed. On Dragon Boat Festival, Cao went to Minhang on business, and Chu Guo again slandered Wang Jinzhang, falsely accusing his wife of having an affair with Xie Ruisheng, and going to Minhang for a secret tryst.

<p>Punan Has Become a World of Bandits: Zhang Desheng's house in Nanlou, Ganxiang, was robbed once last year. Unexpectedly, not long after, on the night of May 27, more than 20 bandits suddenly came, all armed with guns, broke into the house, first tied up the family, and then forced Zhang Desheng to reveal the location of his hidden silver, causing Zhang to be seriously injured.

Also, He Lansheng's family in Wanqiao West had previously received a threatening letter from Tai Bao's A Shu, demanding to borrow 2,000 silver yuan. Lansheng ignored it because he could not afford such a large sum.

According to his confession, he joined the Communist Party through the introduction of Tang and Li. He was ordered to participate in the burning and robbery of Zhuang Hang last time, and the robbery case at Gu Linchuan's house in Fang Ba Tu was also instigated by Tang, and went to open the door and rob with Feng Awu, who had been shot.

According to the party's regulations, half of each robbery must be used to purchase weapons, and three-tenths of the remaining half must be used as the leader's expenses. Therefore, each person only received a dozen yuan. Captain Ding has now sent the criminal to the judiciary for verification. An Earthquake Occurred at Zhuang Hang Yesterday: A small earthquake occurred in the four villages of Zhuang Hang at about 11 pm last night.

<p>The Third Prison Experiences Three Jail Riots: The detention center attached to the High Court in Simaqian Street is located in the Third Prison and holds over 500 inmates, mostly those involved in counter-revolutionary cases. Incidents often occur. Chief Judge Lin of the High Court recently received an anonymous letter stating that contraband was being smuggled into the facility. Yesterday (the 4th) at 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Jin Henian, together with Shi Zechen, the director of the prison department of the court, led police to search each cell in the detention center, but found nothing. They then removed unsanitary food and unauthorized chairs, tables, etc., from various cells in the First and Second Prisons. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo was dispatched to continue the search. A small amount of smoking paraphernalia and opium was found under the floor in the storage room of the Second Prison, and one tael of opium was found in the brick crevices under the toilet in cell 26 of the Second Prison. Since no one claimed ownership of the smoking paraphernalia and opium, Supervising Officer Zhu and the prison officials transferred Mao Yulong and two other guards on duty that day to the local court for investigation. Today (the 5th), they were planning to inspect the Third Prison, the Cross Prison, and the Infirmary, and to redistribute the inmates, moving the sick inmates to the medical facilities for better management. Unexpectedly, at 6:30 AM, the prison opened the cells for morning face washing as usual. As soon as cells one and two in the First Prison were opened, the inmates in those two cells suddenly refused to be locked up again and incited all the inmates to clamor and make demands. Led by Du Junchen, Wang Baoyu, and Wang Baowang in cell 18, they reached through the small food-delivery door and destroyed the iron locks on the cells, rushing out en masse and attempting to break through the main iron gate outside. Throwing bowls and yelling, all the inmates joined in the uproar. The situation was extremely turbulent. At the beginning of the riot, the guard on duty, Cao Yuantian, reported to the prison director. In addition to Chief Judge Lin of the High Court, Chief Prosecutor Wang, Director Shi, and Chief Secretary Wei, who arrived at the scene after hearing the news, Superintendent Ding Lei of the Public Security Bureau, the leaders of the detective and technical teams, Chief Jiang of the West District Mobile Patrol, patrol officers from various branches, and Captain Ding of the First Platoon of the Police Brigade also rushed to the scene with their squads to suppress the riot, finally bringing it under control.

<p>A Violent Crime Outside West Gate: At 8:30 PM on the 4th, four thugs wearing cyan military uniforms and speaking with northern accents arrived at the Hua Songlin family's residence under the suspension bridge outside the West Gate. They knocked on the door and claimed they wanted to smoke opium. Songlin told them that he had not been selling it for a long time and asked for their understanding. The thugs then said they wanted money. As Songlin hesitated, they immediately drew sharp blades and stabbed him repeatedly, causing him to fall to the ground in a pool of blood with serious injuries. The thugs then fled westward. At the time, Songlin's father, Yongqing, was in the inner room. Hearing the commotion, he shouted for help and rushed out to chase after them, alarming the neighbors who joined in the pursuit and threw stones. In the confusion, the thugs left behind a cyan military cap with a white edge, adorned with a porcelain blue sky with a white sun emblem.

<p>Suicide Case at Jintai Inn: At around 3:00 PM yesterday (the 4th), a man wearing a police uniform arrived at the Jintai small inn at the intersection of Zhenjiang Shaanxiang and Wanhelou Alley, carrying two pieces of luggage. He checked into room number two. After drawing water and washing his face, he unexpectedly stabbed himself violently in the abdomen and slashed his neck with a bayonet, causing his esophagus to protrude, his abdomen to rupture, his intestines to spill out, and blood to flow everywhere. The inn's tea server noticed and went out to report, but at this time the guest had not yet died. He climbed out of the door onto the drying platform and then onto the roof, from which he fell into the street and died. The police who arrived on the scene carried him back into the inn, reported to the local court for examination, and inspected his luggage. It was found that the guest's name was Liu Yongsheng, from Anfeng, Xinghua County, currently serving as a first-class police officer in the Second Squad of the Third Branch of the Gaochun County Police. Because he received a letter from his wife urging him to return home, he requested a three-week leave from the squad to return to his village. The reason for his suicide while passing through Zhenjiang is unknown.</p>
<p>Inmate Escapes from Court Detention Center: At midnight last night, a theft suspect escaped from the Zhenjiang Court Detention Center.

<p>Bandits Rampant in Western Yancheng: On May 1st, Sheyang Town, on the border of Yancheng and Bao, was looted by bandits, with twenty-three people abducted. The next day, they robbed the Sha Jiazhuang area and kidnapped three hostages, who have not been ransomed to this day. On the 23rd of the same month, police teams from various counties and local self-defense militias gathered at Jianhekou to suppress the bandits, but the bandits had already heard the news and fled. Only a few houses of the You family (bandit hideout) were burned. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 26th, bandits suddenly arrived at Xia Huangshe and kidnapped Ling Zhongliang. At 4:00 PM on the 29th, Zhao Guansan (a local gentry director) was shot and killed, and two steel rifles were taken. At the same time, the Zhao Zhuang elementary school and neighboring houses were set on fire, Zhao Guangwen was killed, and about ten wealthy households in Jianhekou, including Su Chunyang, Ji Guandou, and Chen Zhaowei, were abducted. All public and private firearms were seized. The next day, the bandits returned to the Ling family at midnight, ordering them to prepare lunch for them the next day to await the payment of ransom. After repeated pleadings from the old farmers, it was agreed that the money would be paid on the 6th. After the meal, they went along the river to Liu Huangshe and confiscated all the self-defense guns and ammunition from the Liu family. They even threatened that anyone with guns should hand them over quickly, or they would kill and set fires. It is said that the area is now nine empty houses out of ten. The wheat is yellow and the rice seedlings are flourishing, but no one is planting or harvesting. Traffic and communication are completely cut off. This tragic situation is truly unbearable to contemplate.</p>

<p>Tu Danran Drowns Himself: Tu Danran, from Xubu Bridge outside the West Gate of this city, was 21 years old and enjoyed sports, often lingering around the basketball court. His father, Gengming, was over fifty years old and had three sons and one daughter, with the eldest daughter not yet married. The second son was Danran. This spring, he married a Miss Guan in the same industry through a matchmaker. Since their marriage, the couple had not been on good terms. His father had been running the Wanyuan Rice Shop for many years, and the business was still thriving. After Danran's marriage in March, his father's restrictions were very strict, and he did not have freedom in spending money, resulting in debts of about 200 yuan. During the Dragon Boat Festival, he asked his father to acknowledge the debt, but his request was not granted. On the 30th of last month, he borrowed 18 yuan from the Wanyuan accounting office and suddenly disappeared. His father, upon learning of this, asked people to search in many ways, but without result. On the 2nd, two letters were suddenly sent from the Weixin Agency on Er Ma Road in Shanghai: (1) To his family, stating that he had used up the household funds, so he had gone to Shanghai to seek a living in the Huangpu River, asking his parents not to grieve in vain; (2) To his friend's family. After receiving the letters, the family took a boat to Shanghai that night to search for him, but he was not at the Weixin Agency, so they placed an advertisement in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, Danran took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train back to Jiaxing on the 3rd. At 7:00 AM on the 4th, he took the Changshun boat to Jia Ping. When the boat reached near Jiuli Pavilion, Danran knew that the boat was about to arrive in Pinghu and he was ashamed to face his parents, so he had an anti-life idea, and pretended to urinate, jumped into the river, by the time the sailors realized to stop the boat and started searching for him, it was no longer possible to rescue him. After the boat returned to Pinghu, the boat company reported to the family, who hired a boat to salvage the body. The body has now been recovered and carried home. The family is crying. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai urging his father to return to Pinghu to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>Accounts After the Closure of Geng Yu Zhuang: The failure of Ningbo City's Geng Yu Money Shop was due to shareholder He Lianxing's speculative failures, resulting in the absconding of funds, leading to the closure of the shop. The total receipts and payments were approximately 800,000 yuan. After auditing by fellow money shop operators, Geng Yu Zhuang had a total loss of twelve yuan in addition to the receipts and payments. Since the shop still held five shares in Hong Cangting, the expected settlement is approximately 70% of the account.</p>

<p>Defeats Datong by a Score of 36 to 16 Last Night</p>
<p>The Beiping China University basketball team competed against the Datong University basketball team at the China Basketball Hall at 8:00 PM last night. Referee Li Jiyuan's final score was 36 to 16, with Beiping China University winning. The first half score was 18 to 12 in favor of Beiping China University. Yesterday was the first time the entire team of Beiping China University displayed their skills. With their height and strength, they were quite capable of representing the athletes of the North. However, their teamwork was not yet well-honed. Although they won because the opponent was of average strength, the performance of the team did not excite the audience. They will face the Xiaoxing team at 8:00 PM tonight. The Xiaoxing team has many talented players and is capable of competing with China University.</p>
<p>As the battle unfolded, China University came down hard, with a fierce attitude. Datong panicked and fell into disarray. China University easily scored four consecutive points. Datong called for a time out to reorganize. After a short time, the defense was gradually reinforced, and China University was unable to do as they pleased. The situation leveled out. In the first half, China University took the lead with a score of 18 to 12. Switching sides and battling again, Datong once again fell into disarray. China University took advantage of the situation to attack and was invincible, resulting in China University winning with a score of 36 to 16.</p>

<p>Referee's Unjust Bias Provokes Universal Derision</p>
<p>Three-Three Draw, Championship Retained</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) In this football tournament, Japan first defeated the Philippines by a score of seven to five, creating a great stir. Subsequently, our nation also defeated the Philippines by five to zero, forming a confrontational situation. On the 29th, at 3 p.m., the Sino-Japanese football final was held at the Meiji Jingu Stadium. Nearly ten thousand spectators were in attendance. Our cheering squad, dressed in red hats and white uniforms, waved flags and cheered, filled with vigor. Unexpectedly, the referee, Takeuchi Toraji, possessed no sporting spirit or sense of fair play, arbitrarily favoring Japan. He unreasonably penalized our players, using offside as a hindrance to our team's offensive, our only weapon. Spectators, aside from the Japanese, were filled with indignation. However, our team members remained calm and fought valiantly, ultimately achieving a three-three draw, no easy feat. The details of the battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Referee Policy　 The Japanese side utilized the referee's bias in various ball games. At the beginning of the match, they strictly targeted the opposing athletes, causing them to lose their spirit. Then, the Japanese army took the opportunity to attack. The same was true for the football match on this day. Within the first fifteen minutes, whenever our team's forwards received the ball and broke through the Japanese team's inner defense line, the referee would blow his whistle loudly, shouting "Offside!" It was both infuriating and ridiculous. As a result, our offense was unable to advance and had to retreat. In the twenty-fifth minute, the Japanese center forward, Shiro Teshima, scored a goal, putting our team in an increasingly disadvantageous position. The ball hovered in front of our goal, but fortunately, goalkeeper Zhou Xianyuan defended well, otherwise, who knows how many more goals we would have lost.</p>
<p>Draw Achieved　 Afterwards, our team was penalized for offside several times. Fortunately, our soldiers fought bravely. Captain Sun Jinshun, fearless, single-handedly broke through the enemy's line. Finally, in the thirty-seventh minute, he kicked a goal from the right, achieving a tie. The Japanese referee policy had to temporarily admit defeat. The first half ended with a score of one to one, a draw. Most memorably, our team was penalized for offside seven times in the first half, while the Japanese team was not penalized even once.</p>
<p>Twelve Minutes　 After switching sides, our team faced an unfavorable headwind. Within three minutes, we were penalized for two corner kicks, creating a very dangerous situation. In the twelfth minute, the Japanese forwards swarmed forward again, and center forward Teshima scored another goal, making the score one to two, Japan leading. Seeing the dangerous situation, our team quickly adjusted its troops, replacing Chen Jiaqiu with Ye Beihua and Li Ning with Feng Yunyou. After the reinforcements entered the field, our team's formation was immediately invigorated. In the sixteenth minute, center forward Dai Linjing dribbled the ball straight towards the enemy goal, raised his foot slightly, and the ball entered the net, making the score two to two, another draw.</p>
<p>Unjust Penalty　 In the twenty-third minute, the Japanese team's right wing, Takayama, received the ball and advanced straight forward. Liang Xianzhan quickly went to intercept it, but the referee suddenly blew his whistle loudly, declaring a foul and awarding a twelve-yard penalty kick. The spectators were all worried for our team, but the ball went over the crossbar, a lucky outcome.</p>
<p>Score Equal Again　 In the twenty-eighth minute, the Japanese team launched another attack. Right forward Shinoshima scored a goal at the edge of the goal, and Zhou Xianyuan was unable to save it, making the score two to three, Japan leading again. Fortunately, in the thirty-fifth minute, Chen Xianyao received the ball and dribbled straight forward, then passed it to Sun Jinshun. Sun passed it to Chen Jiaqiu in front of the goal, and Chen passed it to Dai Linjing. Dai turned around and kicked the ball into the net with all his might, making the score three to three, another tie.</p>
<p>Final Melee　 Afterwards, both sides fought hard for the final five minutes. Our army's momentum increased, and the entire army pressed towards the enemy. There were five opportunities to score, but none were successful, which was a great pity. Most regrettably, Sun Jinshun received the ball in front of the goal, and the Japanese goalkeeper rushed out to grab it but failed. Sun panicked slightly, raised his right foot, and the ball went too far to the right, going out of bounds. Secondly, Dai Linjing shot from about ten steps from the goal, but it was slightly too high, and the ball did not enter the net, which was extremely unfortunate. Before long, the silver whistle sounded, and the ball game ended with a score of three to three.</p>
<p>Game Stopped　 According to football rules, if both teams are tied, the game should be extended for twenty minutes. However, the Japanese referee declared that the game would stop today and be rescheduled for another day. Our team was in uproar. The coach reported to the head coach, John Ma, and formally protested, arguing that the referee had no right to overturn the football rules. The Japanese side was at a loss for words. At 7 p.m. that evening, the committee was convened, and both sides debated for a long time. It was decided that the football game would not be played again, and the championship would be retained until the next tournament. Our chief representative, Zhang Boling, strongly disagreed and insisted on continuing the game. After convening a meeting of officials, it was recognized that the Japanese referee's actions were unreasonable and that continuing the game would bring more harm than good, so it was decided not to play.</p>
<p>Public Outrage of Overseas Chinese　 On this day, no less than a thousand members of the cheering squad and overseas Chinese watched the game. Seeing the Japanese referee's unreasonable oppression, they were filled with public outrage. After the game, they gathered at the athletics field and refused to disperse. They elected three representatives to meet with Hao Boyang, requesting the sports association to formally negotiate with the Japanese side. If there were no results, they should request to withdraw from the Far Eastern Games. After Hao repeatedly comforted them, they finally dispersed.</p>

<p>Chinese Basketball Team Loses to Japan Again for the Second Time</p>
<h3 id="e81">Result: Twenty-One to Thirty-Seven <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Extreme Unfairness of the Referee　　 (Tokyo Dispatch) Our country's second basketball game against Japan was held on the evening of the 27th. Due to rain, it was moved to the indoor gymnasium of Tokyo Prefectural First Middle School. Because the Japanese officials of the Far Eastern Games had not negotiated with the Metropolitan Police Department in advance, it took a lot of trouble to get permission for the game to start at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>In the first half, our country started with Tang Baokun and Yao Enhan as forwards, Jian Chang as center, and Lu Guanjun and Lu Zhongen as guards. Less than a minute after the start, Japan's Ohashi scored a goal, opening the scoring. After a minute and a half, Lu Zhongen scored a free throw, making the score two to one. After that, the two sides fought hard. Japan repeatedly tried to attack but failed. After five minutes, Kobayashi, the newly substituted center, scored a goal, making the score six to one. Before long, the Japanese forwards continued to score, reaching a large difference of fourteen to one. In the fourteenth minute, Liu Jianchang scored two consecutive goals. At the end of the first half, the result was twenty-one to eleven, with China losing by ten points.</p>
<p>In the second half, our team replaced Tang Baokun with Chen Shengkui, Liu Jianchang with Wang Yuzeng, and Liu Guanjun with Wei Pengyun. After the start, Japan scored a goal first. Then, our team's Chen Shengkui and Yao Enhan also scored. At this time, our team's momentum turned strong, and we repeatedly got opportunities to shoot, but none were successful. Especially Wang Yuzeng missed many opportunities. Our country worked hard to catch up, making the score twenty-three to nineteen, a difference of only two points. However, the Japanese side did not show weakness. Ohashi and Tanaka continued to attack effectively, and the score suddenly increased to twenty-nine to nineteen. Seeing the Japanese team's arrogance increasing, our army immediately ordered a change of line. The players who entered the field next were Tang Baokun and Wei Pengyun as forwards, Liu Jianchang as center, and Li Guochen and Wang Xiliang as guards. After that, both sides scored, but our team saw that the general situation was going to be lost and worked even harder, but the formation became chaotic. Finally, Liu Jianchang was sent off, and our team could do nothing more. The overall result was thirty-seven to twenty-one, with our team losing by sixteen points. Our team's performance on this evening was not bad. The defense seemed to be slightly tighter than the previous game against Japan, but Tang Baokun did not get the chance to move around, and the players' poor shooting accuracy were the two main reasons for the failure.</p>

<p>The referees for this evening were still Tanaka and Tojo, who had refereed the previous game. Tojo's improper judgment in the previous trial had already dissatisfied the audience. On this evening, he had even more inappropriate behavior, often glaring at our country's players. Fortunately, our team members were able to endure it, and they obeyed even if there was improper judgment. After the game, many viewers believed that Tojo lacked the decorum of a referee and should not act based on his emotions. They gathered to question him, almost resorting to violence. Fortunately, Tojo saw the opportunity and left first, and after our country's staff stopped them in various ways, they dispersed without incident.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Intense Second Game Between China and the Philippines in Basketball <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>China Loses Again with a Score of Forty-Three to Forty-Eight</p>
<p>Extremely Chaotic Formation with No Coordination or Tactics</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) At 7:30 p.m. on the 28th, the second basketball game between China and the Philippines took place. This was the last chance for the Chinese team. The audience was not very crowded, and few Chinese cheerleaders came to the stadium to cheer them on. This was because of the repeated failures of the Chinese team, which reduced the interest of the supporters. In terms of technique, our team had indeed regressed compared to what they showed in the country. Slow coordination and inaccurate shots were the biggest problems. The percentage of shots made was only about 30% on average, meaning only three out of ten shots were made. The average percentage for the Philippines and Japan was about 60-70%, so how could China not lose? The game this evening was especially laughable. In the first half, everyone except Tang Baokun was not in the formal lineup, but they were still able to win with a score of 30 to 15. In the second half, everyone except Lu Zhongen, who was taken out four times, and Liu Guanjun in the inner defense were in the formal lineup, but they were defeated by a score of 13 to 33. Isn't that strange? The referee this evening was very fair, and the Chinese soldiers were to blame.</p>
<p>Chen Shengkui Scores a Goal At the beginning of the game, Wang Yuzeng made a 0-point shot. Tang Baokun got the ball and passed it to Chen Shengkui. Before long, the ball was snatched away by the Filipino army. The battle became more intense after four minutes. Suddenly, the Filipino forward, Filonino, dribbled the ball straight in, as fast as an arrow. The inner defense couldn't stop it, and the ball went into the basket, opening the scoring. Our team became more determined to resist the violence. Chen Shengkui started shooting and made two consecutive shots. Tang Baokun also made a shot from the center line, making the score 6 to 2, China winning. So the morale was boosted. Both sides were in a melee, and there was no cooperation or rules. They just threw the ball when they got it. Tang Baokun made as many as nine shots. The Filipino army collapsed and was at a loss everywhere. But in this battle, the field was smoky and chaotic, and the shadows were rolling. Both sides were just wielding their clubs in a rude and far-fetched way. Our inner guard, Lu Zhongen, took the ball and dribbled it desperately, never talking about passing. There were no tactics to speak of, but the first half was actually able to win by a large margin of 30 to 15. How strange!</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony of the Games Prince Chichibu Gives Awards Filipino Army Launches a Major Counterattack After the break, the Filipino army changed sides and adopted a long-range shooting strategy. Our defense was still solid, and there was no winner or loser after five minutes of intense battle. In the sixth minute, Tang Baokun fouled again, and the Filipino inner guard made a free throw, opening the scoring. At that time, our side replaced Chen Shengkui with Yao Enhan, but they couldn't resist the Filipino army's attack. They lost as many as eleven points in a row, and our team hadn't even scored a point. They quickly changed their troops and replaced Wang Yuzeng with Liu Jianchang and Liu Guanjun with Li Guochen. The battle situation began to turn slightly. Liu Jianchang was the first to score for our team, making two shots and one free throw. At that time, both sides returned to a balanced state of battle. The strengths were similar. In the last eight minutes, the record was 42 to 36, China winning. But unfortunately, Lu Zhongen was fouled out four times and was quickly replaced by Liu Guanjun. Tang Baokun was fouled three times and didn't dare to move. If he could have calmed down and waited for the opportunity, he wouldn't have failed. Unexpectedly, all the soldiers were flustered and still attacking the enemy in a mess, which allowed the Filipino army to take advantage of the situation. The record changed from 42 to 36 to 42 to 38 to 42 to 42. After the scores were averaged, the Filipino army became even braver and our army became even more chaotic. Li Guochen fouled again and was fouled by the Filipino army, making the score 42 to 43. Then, in two minutes, the Filipino army broke through two more goals, making the score 42 to 47. They fell into an irreversible situation. At this point, there was only one minute left. Tang Baokun had three chances to make free throws, but only made one shot. The Philippines also made one free throw. In the second half, China lost by 13 to 23, and the overall score was 48 to 43, with the Philippines winning by a large margin.</p>

<p>21 to 18 21 to 19</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The second Sino-Japanese volleyball match was held at 3:05 p.m. on the 29th. The referees were Nishikawa and Yamanaka.</p>
<p>In the first set, our team got the right to serve first. Chen Xibing scored a point by blocking and spiking. The Japanese also launched fierce attacks from the first and second rows, and there were many exciting moments. The closest the score got was 17 to 16. Then, our team's front row blocking became effective, and Cao Tingzan and Chen Xibing focused on spiking, finally winning 21 to 18.</p>
<p>In the second set, the Japanese team scored a point on the serve. Chen Xibing returned with a spike. At that time, the opponent's blocking and spiking were also sharp, but Qiu Guangxian's spikes repeatedly attacked the gaps in the enemy's second and third rows, scoring points. In an instant, the score changed to 11 to 5. After that, both sides fought hard and performed extremely well. The score went up and down, creating a tie at 16 points. Seeing that the opponent's weak points could be attacked, our team changed its strategy. The weak points in the enemy's second and third rows became the target of the spikes. The Japanese army couldn't defend and gradually collapsed. Our team won 21 to 19.</p>

<p>Thirty-Eight to Twenty-Nine Japan Wins</p>
<p>The Filipino Army's Strength Far Exceeds the Japanese Team's, Unfortunate Failure</p>
<p>Unfair Japanese Refereeing Provokes Scorn from Own Nationals</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The first game between the Philippines and Japan was a decisive loss for Japan. The second game was held at the Meiji Jingu Sumo Stadium at 7:30 p.m. on the 29th. The referees were Tanaka and Tojo. Less than a minute after the start, the Filipino forward attacked from the front but failed. Then, the Japanese team's Ohashi and Nomura passed and shot, and Kobayashi threw a long shot, making the score 8 to 2. The Filipino army didn't show weakness and quickly caught up, making the score 9 to 6. Seeing the turning point in the Filipino army's actions, the Japanese team quickly added reinforcements to resist. Sure enough, Nomura scored at the 10th minute and Kobayashi scored at the 11th minute. The Filipino army followed closely behind and couldn't give way. The first half ended with Japan leading 20 to 16.</p>
<p>The fighting in the second half was even more intense. The new Japanese lineup was Ohashi and Nomura as forwards, Ouchi as center, and Oba and Kobayashi as guards. By the 4th minute, the Filipino army had caught up to 22 to 21. After that, the Filipino army repeatedly committed fouls (?). Japan therefore gained a great advantage and remained ahead of the Filipino army. By the 13th minute, the score was 33 to 27. The Filipino army added new troops to try to turn the tide, but ultimately failed. The final score was 38 to 29, with the Filipino army losing.</p>

But this achievement cannot be attributed to the Japanese players, but should be attributed to the success of the referee. In this tournament, Japan has been using refereeing policies everywhere to win. In the Sino-Japanese volleyball and Sino-Japanese football matches, the referees did not respect their own personality and only favored Japan. Even the Japanese in the audience scorned the referees for losing their personality and national character. Among the various competitions, the basketball referees were the most despicable and incompetent. Japan's victory in this battle was exactly the same as Japan's victory in the first Sino-Japanese battle. In the eyes of referee Tojo, he only saw the fouls of the Chinese and Filipino players, but did not pay attention to the Japanese players' reckless rushes and the wonderful skill of only hitting people and not the ball. Even the players' big steps were considered legal. There was even something that would make the world laugh and that had never happened in the history of sports, that is, the referee deliberately hindered our army's shooting in the Sino-Japanese ball game, and even crashed into Tang Baokun and fell under the basket. The whistle fell out of the field and took some time to find it before it was found. During this time, he ignored his responsibility as a referee and returned to the field with a glare, intending to put Tang outside the field. Finally, the audience scorned him and stopped him.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Tennis Competition Day 3 <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>China Wins in Women's Doubles</p>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) The second day of the doubles match between the Chinese Li sisters and Ms. Gadia and Ms. Jacobo was stopped due to rain at five to five. The competition continued on the third day at 10 a.m. The Li sisters won two consecutive sets to win the first game, followed by losing the second game with a score of three to six. In the last game, the competition was fierce. China won the first game, followed by losing two games. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth games, the two sides did not give way to each other. The ball went back and forth for a long time, finally ending with a score of six to three. Li Xinghua, Li Mudan, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, Garia, Jacobo.</p>
<p>The Li sisters are both known for their steadiness and mostly wait for the ball at the back. Ms. Xinghua's ball saves are especially skillful. Ms. Mudan attacks more often, but it is not very effective. The Filipino side, on the other hand, has Garia in the back and Jacobo in the front. The Li sisters repeatedly send the ball to the back of the enemy's side to avoid Jacobo's net attacks, making Garia tired of running and unable to continue. This is one of the main reasons for the Li sisters' victory.</p>
<p>The Sino-Filipino women's singles started at 2:30 p.m. In the first match, Ms. Li Mudan played against Ms. Garia. The Filipino representative won the first game with a score of six to two in one go. Ms. Mudan was greatly unsupported. In the second game, Li ran very hard. At a score of four to two, she suddenly won three consecutive games. The situation changed from then on, and she won two games with a total of seven to five and six to two. The victory in an evil battle is the key to our country's victory over the Philippines. The second match was between our country's Li Mudan and Mrs. Ajoa. The latter is the best player on the Filipino island, but her performance today was not special. Li Mudan seemed to be doing things perfunctorily. She did not put much effort into running, and her hits were not very effective. In the first game, she only won the third and seventh games. She performed slightly better in the second game and often won by catching the ball at the edge of the net. But from the fifth game onwards, Miss Xinghua got a little angry and gave the enemy a chance to win, making the score six to three. Overall, Ms. Mudan's women's singles performance on this day was indeed very good. The advantages of being leisurely and not busy, attacking the weak and avoiding the strong are far beyond what the other party, Ms. Garia, can do. Ms. Garia ran so hard that she was sweating profusely and her clothes were all wet, but Miss Li did not drink water or wipe her sweat. Therefore, Ms. Li's victory was not accidental.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese Men Win Against the Philippines</p>
<p>The Japanese team had already won two singles games on the first day and one doubles game on the second day. Today is the final two singles games. The Japanese side, with the victory already decided, sent second-rate players to play in order to respond to the war and left the first-rate players Sato and Fui to fight against our country's Lin and Qiu.</p>
<p>Today's first match was between Mr. Kawachi and Mr. Jacobo. Mr. Kawachi's skills seemed inferior to Mr. Jacobo's, but Mr. Jacobo was impatient and often hit out of bounds. Mr. Kawachi was cautious and finally won with a score of six to one, two to six, six to two, and seven to five.</p>
<p>The tenth World Games will be held in Los Angeles, USA in 1934. The picture shows one of the sports grounds (the records have been seen in yesterday's newspaper)</p>
<p>Then, Anagen played against Mr. Kamo. Mr. A's performance was often better, but he was often inaccurate, and Mr. Kamo's ball saves were effective and were Mr. A's strong opponent. After losing two consecutive games, Mr. A's spirit suddenly lifted. In the third game, he took the lead with a score of five to one. He didn't want to lose one after another and lost six games in a row, losing with a score of seven to five. Mr. A's loss made Japan win the glory of total victory, which is a pity.</p>
<p>After today's competition, the competition between Chinese and Filipino women and Japanese and Filipino men has come to an end, which is also the end of the Filipino players' lucky moment in the ninth tournament tennis competition. After that, the fierce battle will focus on Mr. Lin Baohua and Mr. Qiu Feihai against the Japanese Sato and Fui. The Japanese players' skills are comparable to each other, and it is impossible to predict who will win. The results of the competition between Chinese and Filipino women and Japanese and Filipino men are listed below.</p>
<p>Ms. Li Xinghua 6 1 6 1 Ms. Garia Ms. Li Mudan 2-6 7-5 1-6 Mrs. Ajoa</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of each province and city regarding matters that could be reported in installments: According to the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the term of office for principals and faculty in the province is mostly limited to one academic year, and it is proposed to revise the "Schedule of Matters to be Reported in Installments by Educational Administrative Organs of Each Province and City" issued by the Ministry. "The qualifications, experience, positions, salaries, full-time or part-time positions, etc. of the principals and faculty of each secondary school shall be reported once within one month after the start of each semester" shall be slightly changed to be reported once within one month after the start of each academic year. Also, in the original schedule, "The grades of graduates and students of all levels in each secondary school shall be reported once within one month after the end of each semester. The department believes that the grades of graduates of all levels are usually listed separately by subject and semester and academic year, and the scores and credits are listed in detail. As for the grades of students, it is acceptable not to report the subjects specifically, but to report the total semester scores of each student to avoid duplication. After investigation, the Ministry found that what was stated was feasible and should be slightly changed. All principals and faculty of secondary schools in each province and city whose term of office is more than one academic year may report their qualifications, experience, positions, salaries, full-time or part-time positions, etc. within one month after the start of each academic year. However, if the term of office is limited to one semester, they must still report it every semester. Also, the grades of students of all levels in secondary schools that are reported every semester may not list the subjects specifically, but report the total semester scores of each student. In addition to the instruction and distribution, the order shall be made known to all.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has issued an order to all registered private secondary schools regarding the urgent matter of exchanging seals. According to Instruction No. 1087 from the Ministry of Education, the issuance of seals for private schools at all levels has been addressed.

The materials and dimensions should strictly comply with the regulations on seals issued by the National Government and the attached seal diagrams (square wooden seal, 5.2 cm on each side).

Do not delay further, or you will be held accountable. This order is to be forwarded and made known.</p>

<p>Mr. Qian Fengzhang, a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of Jiaotong University, initially worked as an engineer at the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, he was hired by the Construction Department of the former Guangxi Provincial Government to establish a wireless telecommunications enterprise. He first built the Wuzhou and Liuzhou long-wave radio stations, followed by short-wave stations. He then served as the director of the Wuzhou Wireless Radio Station and concurrently as the director of the Guangxi Wireless Machinery Manufacturing Plant. He returned north last year and resumed his position as a long-distance telephone engineer in the Construction Department of the Anhui Provincial Government. He has now been dispatched by the provincial government to investigate telecommunications and transportation in the United States and is scheduled to depart on the Empress of Russia on June 7th.</p>

<p>A: You're so stubborn and ignorant. Were you born in a pigsty?</p>
<p>B: Yes, precisely because I was born in a pigsty, I'm used to hearing pigs squeal and don't think much of it.</p>
<p>A (Secretly draws a large tortoise on B's back with white powder, then says to B with a smile after a while) Hey, Lao B, take off your clothes and see if that trademark was put on by yourself?</p>
<p>B: You're too lazy. Why didn't you just stand properly instead of leaning your back against mine, which made your shadow print on my clothes?</p>
<p>A: You've fallen madly in love with Miss S. I heard you spent a lot of money on her. Now that she's dumped you, do you feel the sadness of being dumped? B: Although the feeling of being dumped is uncomfortable, it's still better than never having experienced the joy of love.</p>
<p>A: Yes, it's always a bit better. The movie theaters, game fields, Western restaurants, silk shops, jewelry stores, etc., have all benefited from you.</p>

<p>When skin is bitten by mosquitoes or bedbugs and feels itchy, there is no need to apply floral water. Instead, wipe with soap-soaked water, which can stop itching and disinfect more effectively than floral water. The venomous liquid secreted by mosquitoes and bedbugs is called formic acid, which becomes neutral when it meets alkaline soap, thus becoming non-toxic. It's cheap and effective, why not give it a try?</p>
<p>After being bitten by a centipede, one can find a ground beetle (a shell-less snail) and rub it on the bitten area, which can eliminate the poison and stop the pain. It is extremely effective.</p>
<p>On summer nights, one is often troubled by mayflies (a type of small green insect) flying around the lamp. One can place a bowl of water, and the mayflies will fly into the water and swim around.</p>
<p>Rubbing hands and feet with ginger juice in the summer will prevent chilblains in the winter. Eating garlic can prevent cholera in the autumn.</p>
<p>After bathing, rub the whole body with a dry cloth, especially the spine, until it is red. The effect is no less than a massage, and you will feel refreshed and very happy.</p>
<p>Burning small candles in watermelons and lotus pods and hanging them in the courtyard on summer nights is incredibly beautiful.</p>

<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>China, a First-Rate Power of the Future</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Zhao Lingxian, went to study in London, England, two years ago. He lost his father in middle age and was unable to continue his studies. He suspended his studies this spring and returned to Shanghai. My teacher, Mr. Chen Minqing, and eighteen others hosted a banquet for him at the Atlantic Rong Society. The conversations were lively, and the descriptions of the lives of British women, who can be free from worrying about food and clothing in their youthful years and can indulge in the embrace of men all day long, and other customs were all very interesting. Among them, the matter of our country being a first-rate power in the future was bizarre and superstitious. I recorded it to share with readers and await confirmation in the future.</p>
<p>There is a Mr. Bennett in a street in London who runs a questioning stall to make a living, and it has been three years. This spring, a university professor suffered a severe mental breakdown. His wife submitted a volume to Mr. Bennett, asking him to treat him at a certain hospital. As a result, it worked, and Mr. Bennett's name became famous, and his life became more prosperous. A French missionary went to ask about the future world powers. Mr. Bennett thought for a moment and replied with emotion: In the future world, there will only be three countries: ABC. A is America, which dominates the Americas; B is Britain, which stands tall in Europe; and C is China, which is at peace in Asia. At that time, all the newspapers in London competed to publish this prediction and attributed the reasons for the strength of Britain and the United States to the fact that China's wealth and power were due to the intelligence and enlightenment of its people.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Alas, Mr. Yu Tiansui <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Tiansui, whose real name was Yu Shouyi, was from Yufeng. He was eccentric and self-satisfied and called himself "Crazy Lord." As a pioneer of the revolution, he assisted General Yao Yuping in his military affairs and had a spirit of "killing bandits on horseback and writing proclamations off the horse." After the success of the revolution, he retired and devoted himself to poetry and prose. He joined the Southern Society and became a leader in the literary world, unmatched. He was also skilled in writing in the chicken claw style and made monkey old man books in tadpole style, revealing a strong and vigorous spirit, which was regarded as a treasure by those who obtained it. He taught at Caoqiao Middle School in Wuzhong and Chengzhi Middle School in Shanghai for more than ten years. There were no less than hundreds or thousands of students. I also served Mr. with the etiquette of a disciple. Every time I visited or met him at a banquet, he would hold my hand and ask about my recent situation, which was more cordial than usual. He would talk to me about scholarship, and his words were exquisite and brilliant, like jade chips and orchid moss. He once said that scholarship is not easy. I have been reading for forty years before I dare to call myself a knowledgeable person. Mr. had reached the state of thorough understanding. Mr. contracted hemoptysis due to overwork and frustration. It occurred from time to time. In the winter, he was seriously ill and lingering, and he passed away at the end of the year. His illness worsened this spring, and he suddenly returned to the Tao on the 21st of the previous month. He was over fifty years old. After hearing the news, I couldn't help but shed tears. The deep feelings between teacher and student came from the depths of my being. Mr. was a man of great reputation and valued. Although he wrote a lot of works in his daily life, he discarded them as he wrote them and did not collect them himself. Those that were scattered in magazines and newspapers, I deeply hope that someone will compile them into a collection and publish them to last the world, which is also the responsibility of those who die later. Mr. had many side skills. He was skilled in music, engraving, and the art of healing. He could also paint landscapes and flowers. I have his painting of a plum blossom fan, which is elegant and extraordinary, different from the works of ordinary painters. I have treasured it and cannot bear to touch it again.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Queen <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>

<p>A certain university professor often makes humorous remarks when he teaches. Last night, a friend told me one of the professor's remarks, which was quite interesting and valuable. I recorded it to share with readers.</p>
<p>The professor said that the most important social problems are food and sex. If there is food but no sex, life will inevitably be monotonous. Therefore, the pursuit of sex is universal. However, most of those who pursue it cannot get what they want. The example of the queen is like this. The so-called queen is the jade among women. One school has the queen of one school, one place has the queen of one place, one country has the queen of one country, and so on to the world, there is also the queen of the whole world. The above-mentioned queens, except for the queen of one school, whose photos are often seen in pictorials, the rest are rarely seen. The queens of one school, one place, one country, and the whole world are only one, but there are quite a few people who want to ascend the throne of emperor. As a result of the competition, victory often belongs to the beautiful or learned. It is extremely difficult for the ugly and foolish to be lucky enough to win. Therefore, those who are ugly and want to be emperors must work hard to study. There is no other way. I hope that you will not be discouraged if you fail to become emperors while you are in school. You must know that even if the throne of one school is lost, the thrones in other aspects still exist. You should work hard to study. After you have completed your studies in the future, sitting on the golden throne will be a matter of course. However, what is worrying is that the implementation of communism is a crisis for the ugly because marriage is absolutely free in communist society. It is easy for beautiful people to become emperors, but it is difficult for ugly people. Therefore, ugly people do not support communism. At this point, the students couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Interesting Anecdotes from the Countryside <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Hold Buddha</p>
<p>People in Shaanxi attach great importance to eating fish. A friend who returned from Shaanxi said that Shaanxi is extremely high. People walking on the Qinling Mountains look down at the clouds and mists, unable to distinguish the mountains and valleys. Rain must fall under the mountains. People live in the clouds and are far away from the vast sea. There is a saying in the countryside that "Shaanxi is halfway to heaven." Shaanxi has a lot of land and few rivers. The vegetables are green onions, chives, garlic, and ginger. Every meal does not forget meat, and beef, mutton, donkey, and chicken are often served as dishes. Fresh fish is very rare and expensive. Although it is a delicacy for entertaining guests, they dare not taste it lightly. Those who are scholars and have never eaten it when they were young are afraid of its bones. When eating, they must check their eyes, correct their teeth and tongue, and still be afraid that they will not be able to spit out the bones, or assist them with their hands to take them out. They are trembling with fear, only afraid of pricking their throats. If someone happens to talk to them, they will be scolded, saying that if they are stupid, they will be chattering and not seeing that they are eating fish, how can they have time to answer each other? Another friend, Mr. Qian, once traveled to Hetao. One day, a scholar entertained him with delicacies. Looking at it, there were a few small fish and more than ten shrimp. The cooking was not done properly, and there was no freshness, but the locals praised it non-stop.</p>
<p>The custom in Chu is not to talk about ghosts in the morning. People in Chu have been afraid of ghosts since ancient times. Ordinary people often invite shamans to descend to the gods and worship ghosts to pray for peace and recovery if they have a disease. The life of the pipa alley is deserted, and they also burn incense to please ghosts to pray for entanglement, competing to throw money until the night is late and the moon is up. Burning paper money and paper ingots is common in every street. The heat is hateful. The custom has been followed for a long time, which is even more common than in Jiangnan. The word "ghost" is said to be the most unlucky, and they dare not say it. In the morning, expatriates from other provinces are ignorant of the taboo and accidentally say the word "ghost" and words that sound similar to "turtle", etc. When people in Chu hear it, they close their eyes, shake their heads, and cover their ears with their hands, running away quickly as if chased by evil demons and ghosts. Such superstition is ridiculous.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Visiting the Embroidery Exhibition of Qunyi Girls' School <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>Other than Qunyi Girls' School, there has been no public embroidery exhibition in Shanghai. Qunyi has been run independently by Ms. Guo Chunqing. For the past eight years, it has been thriving. Unfortunately, this year it was forced to move by the landlord. As it was not easy to find suitable school buildings, after repeated negotiations with the landlord, Ms. Guo, with the spirit of revolution, fought hard against the capitalists on the one hand and held an exhibition of embroidery achievements on the other hand, hoping to arouse social attention and provide assistance. Her heart is also very kind. After noon on the old Dragon Boat Festival, I went to the school on Haining Road with my younger sister to visit. Five or six students were lined up inside the gate with smiling faces, distributing special catalogs and Ms. Guo's letter of opinion with the landlord to the guests. The principal cordially entertained us and we feasted our eyes. The first room was a black line embroidery with multiple screens. The second room was a sketching embroidery with many Western paintings of landscapes and flower sketches. The third room was the works of the elementary school department, with twenty-four filial piety pictures, one for each person. The fourth room was the works of the graduates of this year. The fifth room was the practical works of each grade, mostly embroidered pillows. The sixth room was the works of alumni, with landscape screens, longevity screens, and Eight Immortals screens, etc. There were hundreds of exhibits, dazzling and beautiful. Looking at them, one can only praise them. This shows that the school is well-managed and the professors are enthusiastic, so the achievements are brilliant. I sincerely hope that Ms. Guo will uphold the spirit of struggle and fight against difficulties with unyielding perseverance. With determination, she will have a more grand exhibition next year, educating young children and seeking employment for women. Is it just the light of Qunyi School alone? After the visit, I was invited to inscribe a character. I gladly wrote the four characters "Ingenious Beyond Nature," returned, and recorded it to tell the readers.</p>

<p>If one wants to count Xun Huisheng's famous plays, one must first mention "Sister Thirteen." This is universally recognized both north and south, and is by no means a flattering word from those who are fond of the play. Apart from Yao Qing, only Huisheng can conform to the graceful and robust spirit of the female knight. Therefore, every time this play is posted in Shanghai this spring, it must be a hit. The Great China Record Company specially hired Xun Jun to record the two-six beautiful tunes of the Bow and Inkstone Edge. With the addition of Ma Fulu's painted face and Deng Jiugongyi, it feels more vivid and beautiful. Huisheng has recorded many records, but her first masterpiece, "Sister Thirteen," is still the first time it has been recorded, which is especially precious.</p>
<p>The farce of "Visiting Relatives and Scolding" is a comedic play known to both women and children. Yao Qing was a wonderful material for this play back then. Now, only Huisheng has the graceful and luxurious atmosphere of a noble banner lady. However, Yao Qing's voice is not suitable for recording records, so one should plan to match Huisheng with a complete 彩旦角 (female clown character) to achieve the beauty of mutual benefit. Now, apart from Ma Fulu, how many people can be called this position? Therefore, listening to the complete play of "Visiting Relatives and Scolding" sung by Xun and Ma, one feels that the comedic 京白 (Beijing dialect) and the graceful and smooth singing are enough to show the unique advantages of the play.</p>
<p>Today, those who perform "Cuiping Mountain" are called the brightest stars of the time, Xun Huisheng and Xiao Cuihua. However, Huisheng has a sweet voice and is good at singing, so she is actually better than Cuihua in the record. The Great China Record Company once included a section of the 南梆子 (Nan Bangzi) from her account, with the addition of a complaint-like recitation, so that it does not feel dry and monotonous. Looking around the north and south, Huisheng must be pushed as the overlord of this play.</p>
<p>The above three plays are all masterpieces of Huisheng, who is unrivaled in both the north and the south. When these films are released in two weeks, I dare to say that they will be extremely popular.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Emerald Nets and Pearl Hairpins: Beautiful Women Return to Good Men; Green Cottages and Crimson Curtains: Famous Courtesans Marry Famous Families. At that time, Zuo Shichen hurriedly asked, "What is 'high ascension'? I don't understand." The elder aunt was a little embarrassed and said, "Second Young Master, don't pretend to be stupid. You must have heard some news outside." Zuo Shichen really didn't understand the meaning of her "high ascension" and said, "What high ascension? Why don't you explain it clearly?" The elder aunt's face turned a little red and said, "High ascension is getting married. We call it 'leaving the profession' in the hall." Zuo Shichen said, "Then, when Anan comes back later, I have to congratulate her!" Although Zuo Shichen said generous words, he couldn't help but feel a little sad when he heard this real news. He casually asked, "Which family is it?" The elder aunt said, "It's that young master Zhang. They run the Xingdang pawnshop in Shanghai. The family fortune is worth millions. Originally, I was reluctant to marry her off. Now, every performance in the hall requires more than 2,000 yuan, and four or five hundred are made, like a flower blooming. Although she gets a lump sum of money when she marries, if she doesn't marry, she can earn it in two performances. It doesn't matter if she helps me for a few more years. But I love this girl the most, Ruiyun. I really treat her like my own daughter. I just wish she was in my belly. Usually, I seem to hold her in my mouth, afraid that she will melt. Not to mention hitting her, I can't even bear to say a harsh word to her. Now, she's getting married at this age, and I'm really reluctant to say it." Her voice was a little sad, and tears seemed to be falling down. Zuo Shichen thought, "You don't need to cry crocodile tears. I know some things. It's probably that young master Zhang offered more money, so the auctioneer hammered it down." Is she really cherishing her adopted daughter and planning for her future? He couldn't bear it anymore and exposed her, saying, "I heard someone say that there are three customers who want your Anan." The elder aunt was surprised and said, "Huh? Did someone really say that outside? Yes, there are, but these two customers are not very good. It's okay to tell the Second Young Master, anyway, you've heard of them. One is surnamed Zhao, Zhao Qi, and the other is surnamed Wu, Wu San. They both said they wanted our Anan. But these two are not as good as young master Zhang. Second Young Master, although I am a person who eats hall food, marrying a person is a lifetime matter. First, I hope they don't come out again. Second, I hope they are happy after marriage. You think that Zhao Qi is young, but he has not been married to his wife for three years, and he is flirting outside. He is naturally a young master, but the economic power is still in the hands of his old father. The old man manages him fiercely, fearing that the young master will have money to come out and play. He only gives him a limited amount of money every month. He took Anan to go and cannot live in the old house, unless he wants to hide it from the family and rent a small mansion. This is a private niche."</p>

<p>Market Sentiment Disorderly and Without Direction</p>
<p>Fluctuations of Eighteen Taels Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Resulting in a Decline of Seven Taels and Eight Mace</p>
<p>The Rising Trend Briefly Subsides, but Volatility Remains Fierce. Yesterday, the fifth, the precious metal standard seemed to reverse its upward trend, although the momentum for change remained strong and unstoppable. Throughout the day, the waves were quite large, and the market sentiment was disorderly and indescribable. There were still fluctuations of seventeen or eighteen taels. Foreign exchange weakened, and banks frequently had different inflows and outflows. Wanxing, Fuchang, and Chengfengyong all purchased and sold, while Fuyu, Yuancheng Yong, and Dadecheng sold. From the early market, large transactions and low peaks were frequently seen. Although the opening price was high, once it jumped above ninety taels, the foreign exchange rate remained unchanged, and internal loosening suddenly shifted to a downward trend, plummeting by more than ten taels and breaking through the eighty-tael mark. Afterward, many buyers appeared, and rumors suddenly spread within the market that forward contracts for this month might require an additional one or two taels, because the daily gold price was far from the metal price, prompting short sellers to cover their positions, causing a sudden jump of more than ten taels. Later, arbitrageurs re-entered the market, and Hengxing and others sold slightly, but because exchange rates weakened again, the price broke into the eighty-tael range, with only five or six taels of potential support. Subsequently, it stood at the eighty-tael mark.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Frequently Contracted, Opening at a High Price Yesterday, British silver continued to decline by one-half, and the silver price contracted by one fen. The opening price for July was five hundred and ninety-four taels, plus six taels and two mace. The gross price fell from ninety-four taels and five mace to eighty-two taels. This was due to a surge of sellers and weak exchange rates. In July, British banks took in six pence and one-eighth, but the appetite faded. A slight increase of three or four taels followed, but the prior order to post the price as before caused a setback, returning to eighty-one taels. Then, because Dehua sold September six pence and seven-eighths, which was bought by Sumitomo and others, the August price could settle at six pence and a half, and the price fell another four or five taels. Around ten o'clock, it suddenly went to seventy-six taels and five mace. After that, July British gold could be traded at six pence and one-quarter, but August settled at only six pence and three-eighths, so the gold price soared. This was because large players took action, and short sellers covered their positions. The atmosphere turned good, and the price surged by more than ten taels, reaching ninety-one taels and some change around eleven-thirty. At noon, it suddenly softened again, and the market's confusion was difficult to grasp. Most firms were caught off guard. At the noon close, the price was eighty-four taels and five mace.</p>
<p>The Closing Price Fell to Eighty Taels. The market opened at eighty-five taels and five mace, and commodities opened high. Afterward, it gradually declined, falling six taels, because foreign exchange was particularly tight. July could be settled at six pence and three-eighths. Shanghai took in July Japanese gold at one tael, three mace, and three fen, and the firms sold heavily. Around two-thirty, the price was seventy-nine taels. Afterward, Fuchang and commodities firms came to buy, and the English gold from this month was sold to Mitsui by Huabi HSBC at six pence and three-sixteenths, so the price jumped six taels. After three o'clock, it was eighty-five taels and five mace. Then, as sellers moved again, the price was suppressed by a small five or six taels. At four o'clock, it was seventy-nine taels and five mace. In general, market sentiment was extremely chaotic and without any fixed direction, truly like steering with the wind. Finally, there was a slight fluctuation of one or two taels before the market closed at four-thirty for five hundred and eighty taels, a decline of seven taels and eight mace compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Posted Price Was Higher by Slightly Less Than One Hundred Taels. The maximum price during the day was ninety-four taels and five mace, and the minimum price was seventy-six taels and five mace, a difference of eighteen taels. The posted price was still six hundred and eighty-two taels and eight, a reduction of nearly one hundred taels. In the afternoon, the price was called at one hundred and one and two, with eighty-five taels added for water on the ledger. In the afternoon, eighty taels were added for water. Commodities opened in the morning at ninety-three taels and five, closed at noon at eighty-four taels. In the afternoon, they opened at eighty-five taels and closed at seventy-eight taels and five mace.</p>
<p>The Inflows and Outflows of Various Firms Were Irregular. Trading within the industry was very uncertain, and the market was truly chaotic. Fuchang Yongchengyong, Dakang, Yiyu, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Chengfengyong, and previous short sellers all progressed smoothly. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, and Yuantai had irregular inflows and outflows. Fuyu, Jinda Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Yuda, Yuanxingyong, Senchangyong, and Dadecheng all sold. In the afternoon, Hengxing and Juchang sold, while Yuanmaoyong, Fuchang, Hengxingyuan, and Yu Yuyongtaixing all progressed smoothly. Wanxing had more inflows than outflows, and customer orders came in and out intermittently, with an apprehensive attitude. The Dalian gang sold a total of more than two thousand contracts, with purchases of two thousand two hundred and three hundred contracts. It seems that the Guangdong gang was also scalping.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Foreign Exchange and Domestic Markets Loosen <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Large Fluctuations, Apprehensive Sentiment</p>
<p>Arbitrage Closer, Supply and Demand Slightly Stronger</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's foreign exchange rates remained unchanged. Although large orders continued to shrink, the Shanghai market seemed to loosen. Only Hong Kong had increased by two taels, reaching eighty-five taels. The trend of bank transaction prices was reversed. The previous day had declined, so arbitrage was closer. British gold was estimated to be around forty taels, so Chinese merchants had some supply and demand. From the morning, the market was stable, but it suddenly loosened. There was still some potential support, but the gold market's rising trend subsided, although the turbulence was still tight. There were still seventeen or eighteen taels of fluctuation, and finally, it fell to a low peak. As a result, the price was better than the fourth. First, the leading price for foreign exchange was long by one penny. U.S. gold was long by two yuan, and Japanese gold decreased by eight fen. In terms of transactions, British gold totaled about 300,000 pounds. Chinese merchants each had inflows and outflows of 100,000 pounds. Real estate Sumitomo purchased, Guang Gang, etc., settled, Mengxing, Mitsui, and Korea sold. Various banks also transacted more than 100,000. In U.S. gold, the gold industry sold about 200,000 yuan to Sumitomo Shanghai, etc. Only a few hundred thousand yuan of Japanese gold was sold to Sumitomo Shanghai, which had a slight inflow. However, the arbitrage was still far, and the gold price was still under pressure. Compared with the transaction price of the previous day, the difference was close, and people's sentiment was apprehensive. The market's changes were inevitably violent.</p>
<p>The difference between British exchange and the domestic market was about one penny. The difference between the various forward months was one-eighth seven five to one-quarter. In the morning, the price for this month was about one shilling, five pence, three-eighths. July was six and one-quarter, August was seven and a half, and September was eight and three-quarters. The buying price added one-sixteenth. At noon, the price for this month was six pence. July was one-eighth seven five, August was three-sixteenths, and September was four and three-eighths. In the afternoon, the market closed with the price for this month at six pence and a half. July was six and one-quarter, August was seven and a half, and September was eight and three-quarters. The buying price still added one-sixteenth.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in the Eastern exchange domestic market were as much as nine fen, and the difference between forward contracts was about one fen. The difference between the bank's inflow and outflow prices was about one fen in the front market and a half fen in the rear market. However, it also depended on the position for the shift. The chaos in the market recently was unimaginable. In the morning, the price for June was one tael, four mace, and two fen. July was one fen, August was four mace, and September was three mace and nine fen. At the noon close, the price for June was three mace and a half, July was four fen, August was three fen, and September was two fen and a half. The buying price subtracted one fen.

Copper coins suddenly shrank by two thousand wen to four hundred and eight thousand wen, and it seemed to shrink back to the ten-thousand mark.

<p>Significant Fluctuations, 19 Million in Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market in the local securities market was the most prosperous it had been in half a year. The market was unusually lively, and there were huge inflows and outflows from all parties. Transactions in the first two markets exceeded 10 million, and the afternoon market had 8.3 million, but spot trading was still rare, totaling 27,000 yuan. The trend of bond prices was chaotic, rising and falling sharply. The initial trend in the morning was still weak, and there was still strong selling pressure in the market. Although buyers were also very active, they could not compete with the dominance of the sellers. Bonds such as the Aftermath, the Military Customs, and the Continued Roll all fell sharply. Then, as buyers turned bullish, prices gradually rose, and many bonds rose by two or three yuan. The afternoon trend was relatively flat, and apart from the initial price drop, there were no major changes. As a result, bonds such as the demobilization, customs, and continued roll all fell significantly. Aftermath futures also fell by one yuan and several jiao, while demobilization this month rebounded by one yuan, and disarmament futures also improved by about half a yuan. Other changes were only a few jiao.</p>

<p>Yarn Market Trend Uncertain</p>
<p>The yarn market opened down in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation was chaotic. It was really driven by the trend of the gold market, and the market was difficult to stabilize for a while. However, most people think that the yarn market is tired because of the domestic war chaos, resulting in a lack of purchasing power from all parties. There are still many people who are short selling. However, the price of silver is cheap, and the price of foreign goods is high. The business of domestic yarn is more promising. It is hoped that the Niuzhuang gang in the north will gradually become active, because the combined price of Japanese yarn is expensive.</p>
<p>The price of yarn is controlled by three grades. The opening price of the exchange's price of yarn in the morning market was flat in the gold market, and the large seller suppressed it and fell by two or three plates, and the downwind became more intense. The three-grade yarn fell sharply by six yuan, and the result was a decrease of one or two, seven qian, one or two, three qian, one or two, two qian, and the distant month fell by four or eight qian. In the afternoon, I heard that the three-grade yarn rebounded by six or seven yuan, and the actual sales were also good, and the buying was also strong. All months rose by one or two, one qian to one or two, two qian nine, seven qian. Statistics of the total daily turnover of 23,600 bales. The closing price of the yarn is recorded on the left. The closing price of the yarn is increased or decreased, and the number of stocks is September 1610 Down 317,850. 6 June 1573 Down 625,050. 10 October 162 Up 317,100. 7 July 1582 123,700. 11 November 1617 35,950. 8 August 1600 426,350.</p>
<p>Yihe Factory opened 4,500 bales of spot yarn, and sales were still good. Various gangs bought 1,945 bales of futures and spot goods, while the industry took in 4,800 bales. Various gangs pushed Niuzhuang to enter 555 bales, which was the most. In addition, Xuzhou entered 155 bales, Tianjin entered 165 bales, Wuhu entered 50 bales, the mainland entered 235 bales, Shantou entered 300 bales, Fujian entered 85 bales, Sichuan entered 220 bales, Qinhuangdao entered 105 bales, Hanbang entered 35 bales, and Zabang entered 45 bales.

<p>Japanese Merchants Buy on Dips. Distant Futures Continue to Rise by Half a Tael. The cotton market started down and then rose. Although foreign cotton continued to fall, due to the established exchange rate in this market and the lack of bottom goods, the stocks in all routes were empty. The source of Hanlu was lacking, and there were very few new sellers of foreign cotton at a combined price of 40 liang. The market situation was tight, and sellers disappeared. If the foreign exchange market does not relax, there will be drastic changes in the future of the cotton market.</p>
<p>The Hanbiao Middle Month Jumped Out by Eight Liang. The opening price of the Hanbiao on the exchange in the morning market was slightly softer due to the flat gold market and the declining yarn market. Retail sellers were selling out, and the near three months fell by one qian to one qian and a half, and the distant month rose by five fen. In the afternoon, the table suddenly tightened, and the upward trend became stronger. Because of the lack of sellers, the three-grade yarn rebounded, and each month rose by one qian, five fen to four qian and a half. Statistics of the total daily turnover of 48,600 dan. The closing price of the Hanbiao is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the guest discrimination of imported rice was very light. The stomach going of this street was also micro, but the military sector went to handle a large batch of military rice, which supported the market. The unified market transaction was small, with 8,000 bags of Jiaoxiao, 2,000 bags of Saigon, 2,000 bags of Mindang, 200 bags of Daxiao, 300 bags of Sugeng, and 3,000 bags of brown rice.

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, the months were all small due to sunny weather, and there was new wheat arriving at the port. People's hearts were even more downward, and the bulls also had a return. The closing price was stable. It is estimated that June was small by 1/7, July was unchanged, August was small by 2/7, September was small by 1/7, October was small by 2/7, and November was small by 1/7. About 1,000 old wheat Chen goods were opened, and the price was similar to the previous market. New wheat arrived and saw more, and the price slightly returned. The flat goods were also better. It is estimated that about 4,000 were opened, with 4 liang 7 qian 5 fen for high, 4 liang 5 or 6 qian for medium, and 4 liang 2 qian 0 for secondary.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in the local area was still difficult to make progress. Because the price of new cocoons this year is high, the cost of the factory's own cocoons must be 1,230 or 40 taels. However, the prices offered by the American and Japanese companies are not high, and the factory loses money and it is difficult to sell. Yesterday, only Mitsui and others entered 30 packages of new factory this month, and the price did not rise.</p>
<h3 id="e122">More Than 100,000 Packages of Zhejiang Dry Cocoons Transported <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>A Large Batch of Cocoon Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>The new dry cocoons of various Zhejiang provinces are piled up at the station and exposed to the sun and rain, waiting to be transported, and the Railway Bureau lacks vehicles. Although the silk factory industry association has repeatedly consulted with the traffic manager of the Railway Bureau, it was promised to stop loading passenger and cargo for two days to transport cocoon packages. However, the dry cocoons of various provinces are piled up like mountains, and the Shanghai factory needs cocoons very much. Therefore, the cocoon merchants hired hundreds of large barges and dozens of small wheels, and actively loaded and transported by water and land. In addition to the transportation by freight car, in the recent four or five days, a total of 350-60 cocoon ships from various provinces have arrived. The cocoon ships are full on both sides of the Suzhou River, with a total of more than 100,000 packages of new cocoons loaded. They are now hiring small workers to carry them to the store. A large batch of cocoon ships from Shaoxing will arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Anhui and Jiangxi New Tea Summary <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Most of the new teas in Wuyuan have not been sold. The market has been bleak in recent days. Except for the opening and trading of some southwestern villages, only 3/10 of the household tea on the north road is sold. No one has asked about the new tea of ​​Da Dayuan so far. The general tea households urgently need to apply the wages for making tea due to the famine and lack of rice, so they sell it at a low price. Recently, the new tea market has automatically fallen from 80 yuan to 50 yuan. Although the tea houses know that the price is cheap and can be handled, the food in this county is lacking and they are suffering from nowhere to transport the foreign stomach. It is difficult to force the previous opening and trading. Now there is no money to pay, so the mountain households who sold and did not sell are all crying. The ticket price in the market has gradually risen to more than 1,310 yuan due to the exhaustion of the current foreign currency. There is still a market and no cash. The tea money is urgently needed, and they have flocked to Jingzhen Wuwan to apply for foreign currency to save themselves.</p>
<p>The Qinghong Tea Shop in Fuliang has a good sales volume. The red tea in the northeast of Fuliang and the green tea in the south have recently fallen in mountain prices due to the narrow stomachs of foreign houses. The store village learned that the mountain prices were low, and took the opportunity to search for and manufacture baskets and transport them to Su, Hu, Zhenjing, Chang, Xi, and other ports. The stomach removal is quite bad. Nanchang Raozhou helps the store dealers to also gather in Fudi to buy, but Gaozhuang green tea is too low for the store village to sell, so they are transported to Wuyuan. The market price is from 60 yuan to 42 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Piece Goods: Price Increases Cause Inland Purchasing <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The piece goods market has been stimulated by the exchange rate market, showing a strong upward trend. Yesterday, it continued to rise, with good sales activities. The reason is that inland merchants saw reports of drastic changes in the exchange rate market and soaring prices, so they came to Shanghai to purchase goods. Yesterday, Double Children Deer Yuan Straight Tribute Nankeen was selling at 2.45 candareens. The market quote had to be 2.5 candareens. Moganshan Hunting Goose Muqiu was selling at 2.8 candareens. The market quote was 2.85 candareens. Fine Serge also rose by 0.25 candareens. Ancient City Guild was already demanding 2.875 candareens. Huxinting Joy Bald Blue-Gray was uniformly 2.45 candareens. Flower Straight Tribute Nankeen, Sun Beauty assorted colors, was 2.9 candareens. Bald Large Red was 3 candareens. Bald Yuan color was 2.95 candareens, a sharp increase of 1 candareen compared to the previous day. This is mainly because the inventory is empty. Although the East Exchange saw a slight consolidation yesterday, the difference in capital is still huge. In addition, due to the fact that the pricing of Straight Tribute Nankeen and Straight Tribute Satin is not profitable, there are very few orders placed. It is feared that there will be a shortage in the autumn, so even at this off-season time, some people are eager to buy Western goods. Yesterday, bleached cloth also rose. Taihe Red Chicken opened at 11.5 taels. Gongping Red Little Deer opened at 11.35 taels, a rise of 0.3 to 0.4 taels.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Upstream Navigation Stagnant <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Suspension of Transport to Changsha: Yesterday, a certain shipping company in this port received an urgent telegram from Hankou stating that a certain ship en route to Hunan had already returned to Yuezhou. Shipments bound for Changsha from Shanghai were to be temporarily suspended. The Hunan cargo on the various river steamers that had already left Shanghai was instructed to temporarily store the cargo in the Hankou warehouse when it arrived in Hankou for safety.</p>
<p>Hunan Ships All Suspended: The Taikoo Company's upstream vessel, the "Ji'an," set sail from Shanghai this morning, temporarily ordered to run the Yangtze River route, while also going to Shashi and Yichang, but not to Changsha. Two of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Hunan route vessels have been suspended for the use of Japanese residents.</p>
<p>British and American Warships Rush Upstream: Foreign shipping on the Yangtze River is very extensive, and there are also a large number of foreigners in Hunan Province. In addition to the Japanese First Foreign Expeditionary Force, which has already dispatched six warships to the upper reaches for escort, the British Yangtze River flagship "Bee" has also carried Naval Vice Admiral Maclean to Changsha in haste. In addition, the American Yangtze River flagship "USS Isabel" also set sail from Shanghai yesterday, heading directly to Hunan to protect foreign residents.</p>
<p>Six Merchant Ships Diverted to Hankou: The first batch of six merchant ships from Guangdong to Shanghai, when passing Wusong on the 2nd of this month, were dispatched to Jiujiang along the river. Yesterday at noon, each ship also sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that when the ships arrived at Xunpu, they were immediately ordered to rush to Hankou without stopping. All ships immediately weighed anchor and headed west, and it is expected that they will arrive safely in Hankou today.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Silver Cheapness Affects Shipping <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Silver Arrive in Shanghai: The price of gold has soared, the price of silver has plummeted, and foreign silver continues to arrive in Shanghai. Since the National Government explicitly prohibited it, large bars from San Francisco, USA, continue to be imported. The previous "Asama Maru" loaded 1,373,321 taels of large bars, which were purchased by various banks in Shanghai. They wanted to unload them in Shanghai, but were prohibited by the Customs, so they changed to Hong Kong. A certain American ship also transported a batch of silver bars the other day, with a huge amount. To avoid the prohibition, they were not unloaded at the wharf. Today, the Japanese ship "Tatsuta Maru" arrived in Shanghai, and the ship also loaded a large quantity of silver bars purchased by Shanghai banking circles. They are currently planning to unload them, but it is not yet known whether they can land. On the 9th of this month, it was heard that another million taels of American silver would arrive in Shanghai, but the loading and unloading were very secretive, and no third party was allowed to know except the crew and bankers. According to the current situation, on average, the United States imports at least six batches of silver bars to Shanghai every month, with each batch being more than one million taels and at least 300,000 to 400,000 taels.</p>
<p>Japanese Sugar and Piece Goods Sharply Reduced: After the price of silver plummeted, the price of Japanese gold has also gradually soared. Chinese merchants in our country have stopped transporting most of the Japanese sugar and piece goods they ordered. It is found that the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha ships transport the most sugar to Shanghai, importing 10,000 to 20,000 bags each time. In the past ten days, the Japanese ships coming to Shanghai have reduced the import of sugar, rock sugar, and foreign cloth, which have always been the major commodities in trade with China. Last week, only a few thousand bags of Japanese sugar arrived, and foreign cloth was also scarce, a decrease of 60% to 70% compared to before.</p>
<p>European and American Imports Are Not Prosperous: Recently, the imported goods loaded on the various merchant ships coming to Shanghai from the United Kingdom have shown anomalies. The woolen goods and nankeen foreign goods from that country are as rare as morning stars. For example, a giant ship of over 10,000 tons arriving in Shanghai would normally have 300 tons of piece goods, but now it only has 20 to 30 tons. Steel products and military supplies are increasing daily. As for the New York cargo ships coming to Shanghai from the United States, except for the materials of various oil companies and the tobacco leaves ordered by foreign merchants, there are no other goods arriving in Shanghai. The maritime market has been severely affected by the cheapness of silver.</p>
<p>Inland Foreign Goods Suspended: The Yangtze River and coastal route ships in this port have recently not been transporting foreign goods to the various ports of the Yangtze River and the northern and southern oceans. Taikoo, Jardine, and Nisshin, etc., which used to transport the most foreign goods, have transported local goods from the mainland on their ships in the past ten days. From this alone, it can be known that foreign goods are being reduced everywhere in the mainland. According to Chinese ships, foreign goods exports have been equal to zero since the rise in gold prices. Nowadays, Chinese ships going to the Northern Ocean only carry 10% of exports, which can be described as extremely declining.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Gold Prices Eased Slightly Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of gold was 594 taels, with a maximum of 594.5 taels. The closing price in the afternoon was 580 taels. Silver shop gold was 82.5 yuan, slightly lower than yesterday. The world financial market can be affected by even the slightest thing. There is no so-called national boundary. Moreover, this port is close to the Japanese gold market and follows the Japanese side for transfers. Therefore, the status of Japanese gold coins today has a close relationship with us, which is also something that financial people cannot fail to know. According to the Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun," since the beginning of April, the Yokohama Specie Bank has purchased gold coins from the Bank of Japan for 50 million yen due to the shortage of overseas gold reserves. The reason for the shortage of its overseas gold reserves is due to the sluggishness of the Japanese silk market and the export bills being far less than the bank's expectations. As for the Bank of Japan, within the first month after the lifting of the gold embargo, a total of 70 million yen of gold coins flowed out, most of which were sold to the Specie Bank. At present, the Japanese foreign exchange situation is that there are very few export bills on the market, and the Bank of Japan has to continue to supply gold coins to the Specie Bank, so the future of its gold coins is not optimistic. In addition, after China banned the export of gold, the situation is even worse. The Sumitomo and Mitsui banks have been providing spiritual assistance for the lifting of the gold embargo, so they specialize in searching for cash in foreign groups. Now that their way of transporting cash from Shanghai to the United States has been prohibited by the Customs, the two banks have decided to increase overseas gold reserves for foreign exchange. In the future, if China does not lift the embargo, it will only have to purchase cash from the Bank of Japan, so Japanese gold reserves will gradually flow out, which will eventually affect the status of Japanese gold coins. It is found that the cash purchased by Japanese exchange banks in Shanghai has reached 35 million yen to date, but this is still not enough to offset the import bills for the first half of the year, and it is necessary to transport some more gold coins overseas. This means taking it from the Bank of Japan, and there is no other way. (Note: Japan's foreign trade has always been an excess of imports over exports, but it is an excess of exports over imports with China, so it often uses the money earned from selling goods to China to absorb gold coins in China to compensate other countries.)</p>
<h3 id="e129">Recent Statistics on Foreign Silver Imports <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to a survey yesterday, the exact amount of foreign silver imported from the United States and other countries in Shanghai and Hong Kong in May is as follows: (1) Shanghai imported (American silver) 2,050,428 pieces, foreign silver 1,341,248 pieces; (2) Hong Kong imported 641,415 pieces of American silver and 101,122 pieces of foreign silver. Compared with April, it has decreased considerably.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Import and Export Industries Plummet <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Most Cargo Ships Suspended</p>
<p>The soaring price of gold and the plummeting silver market have affected all industries, with the import industry being the most affected. Export commodities from various places are also very sluggish due to various reasons. Recently, the daily import and export of goods has decreased daily, reaching only one-third of the past. Small cargo boats and tugboats of various transportation companies are suspended in half due to lack of cargo to load. The Shanghai Transportation Company usually has 46 pairs of small boats and 5 tugboats, averaging about 50,000 tons of import and export cargo per day. Recently, it has only been about 20,000 tons, and there is a trend of further reduction in the future. The decline of the import and export industry is really an unprecedented phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Red Cross Rescue of Wounded Soldiers <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The departure of the Chinese Red Cross rescue team has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday (the 5th), at about 1:00 PM, 150 to 160 seriously wounded officers and soldiers were sent from the Nanjing Military Medical Department to the Mackenzie Road Station. A total of seven iron-roofed freight cars were attached. Upon arrival at the port, Wang Peiyuan, chairman of the Chinese Red Cross on Jiujiang Road, along with more than 40 people including secretaries, staff, nurses, and laborers, used the association's ambulances and hired four trucks from the Shanghai Loading Ground Company to transport them to the Tianjin Road Hospital in turn. It was not completed until 5:00 PM. When the soldiers' car arrived at the station, the Red Cross first gave each person a bowl of hot tea, and Chairman Wang personally examined each one. Those who were seriously injured were taken to the car in advance, with the most being those with broken feet, broken wrists, broken femurs, and broken humeri. One soldier had a bullet that penetrated from the left cheek to the right cheek, breaking the tongue and dragging it out of the mouth, which was extremely miserable. One person died on the way due to being unable to withstand the bumping. According to the wounded soldiers, the fighting near Lanfeng was the most fierce. Those who were lightly wounded were rescued, and many who were seriously wounded died on the spot. Some were rescued and then died. There were too few nurses on the way, and they urinated and defecated in the car. It was also difficult to eat. Now, with the Red Cross providing assistance, there is still hope for rebirth. Amidst the sad cries, there is also a sense of joy, which can be said to be a stroke of luck in misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Conference on Abolishing Likin <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The General Assembly Postponed for One Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance of the National Likin Abolition Conference specially appointed Councilor Li Jihong to come to Shanghai and use the Central Bank on the Bund as a preparation office to preside over the General Assembly. The opening ceremony of the General Assembly was originally scheduled to be held on the 1st of this month, but because the financial departments of the provinces and the special commissioners of the Ministry of Finance were unable to arrive in time, only the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui had to announce a postponement. The meeting will be held after more than half of the representatives have arrived. In addition, the current financial authorities believe that the abolition of likin is important, and they are collecting opinions and formulating plans to implement them effectively and achieve practical results. Therefore, it was decided to postpone it for one month and change it to early August. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance instructed Councilor Li to stay in Shanghai to receive the registered representatives and invite the representatives of the provinces that have arrived to hold a preparatory meeting to prepare in advance. Therefore, there are still two or three preparatory meetings before the General Assembly so that the General Assembly can shorten the time. It is heard that the scope of discussion at the preparatory meeting and the formulation of plans are roughly: special consumption tax belongs to the national tax, and business tax belongs to the local tax.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Aftermath of the Accidental Loss of the Arsenal <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The propellant filling room near the Gaochangmiao West Fort of the Shanghai Arsenal suddenly exploded on the morning of the 2nd due to improper filling, killing 13 people and injuring 24. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. The reporter of the Guowenshe went to inquire again yesterday. According to Section Chief Pang of the General Affairs Section of the factory, the number of seriously injured workers who died one after another due to their injuries until last night, including the previous ones, was 21. The compensation measures are now determined that the deceased will be given 100 yuan for funeral expenses and 500 yuan for each person. The foreman, Shi Changhua, will be given double compensation due to his many years in the factory, totaling 1,000 yuan. The injured will be given compensation after they recover and are discharged from the hospital. The memorial service can only be held after the coffins are first placed in a temporary location due to the fact that the families have no place to store the coffins and the preparation takes time. It has been agreed with the families. Therefore, the foreman, Shi Changhua, has already been buried today. Today, Factory Director Guo has reported the situation to the Ordnance Department and the General Headquarters.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Feng Wenyu Was Sworn in Yesterday <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Feng Wenyu, the newly appointed Director of the Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Five Districts of Jiangsu, was transferred from the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of Southern Anhui. He took office on May 13. At 10:00 AM yesterday, he held a supplementary swearing-in ceremony at the Bureau on Anlan Road, Ximen. In advance, he sent invitations to various agencies and gentry for guidance. Those who arrived at the time included: Supervising Official, Section Chief Zhen of the Anti-Smuggling Department, Shao Shen, Representative Tang Muyao of Songjiang Transportation Deputy, Representative Hu Dazun of the Audit Branch Office, Representative Wu Qiankui of the Municipal Finance Bureau, Representative Sun Jianhou of the Social Bureau, Representative Wang Zhijing, Second District Chief of the Public Security Bureau, Representative Han Xiangjiang of the Special Zone Local Court, Representative Zhu Chen of the First District Chief of the Jiangsu Water Police, Section Chief Yang Tianyu of the General Headquarters Camp Management Office, Representative He Zhenping of the County Party Department, Liu Chunpu, French Concession Stamp Tax Commissioner, Zhou Xiangling, Wang Shoushan, Zhang Danru, Cheng Lingjiu, Yao Yuqin, Gu Jiatai, Huang Jinrong, Jin Tingsun, Shen Xingshan, Su Jiashan, Shen Baoyi, Chi Yueqiao, Li Yingsheng, Fu Qihua, Gu Zhangsheng, Li Genxing, Qin Liankui, Wang Zhongqi, and others, more than 100 people. At 10:10, the meeting began, the music was played, and the whole audience stood solemnly and bowed three times to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Prime Minister. Supervising Official Zhen respectfully read the Prime Minister's will, and Director Feng swore an oath. After the oath, Supervising Official Zhen gave a speech, roughly saying that Minister of Finance Song established two general teams in advance for the purpose of rectifying salt affairs and anti-smuggling, and to understand the current situation of anti-smuggling in the country, sent supervisory committee members to various bureaus to conduct detailed investigations and report, and formulated an entire rectification plan to be implemented step by step. The five districts of Jiangsu are the important areas of land and water in the country. Director Feng has extensive experience in handling anti-smuggling affairs in Huainan, Fujian, and Southern Anhui, and is especially courageous in doing things. The Anti-Smuggling Department intends to use Director Feng's ability to start with the five districts of Jiangsu, promote it to the whole country, and in the future, the five districts of Jiangsu can be a model for the national anti-smuggling bureau. However, there should be a policy for handling affairs. Although anti-smuggling is now independent, all matters should be coordinated with the salt transportation envoy, transportation deputy, tax transportation bureau, audit branch, audit and supervision, and implemented in consultation and carried out jointly. If this can be done, the handling of affairs will not be isolated, and the tax revenue of anti-smuggling reform will be increased. It is hoped that Director Feng will use his strong perseverance and fighting spirit to enrich the country's tax revenue and increase the sales volume of merchants. I hope that what I expect and realize at today's swearing-in ceremony. Next, Zhou Xiangling, president of the Salt Merchants Association, gave a speech, roughly saying that it is a great honor to participate in Director Feng's swearing-in ceremony today. Salt merchants hope that the sales volume of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau will increase daily. The five districts of Jiangsu are located in an important area. Salt smuggling from Changlu and Shandong and various private salt fields in Zhejiang are pouring into the area. Last year, the remaining warlords left over from Jiangbei used the pretext of refugees fleeing to smuggle large amounts of private salt and hide weapons from Lianghuai. There were as many as 4,000 to 5,000 private salt boats coming south. The five districts of Jiangsu were unprepared in advance, resulting in a shortage of 20,000 to 30,000 introduction papers in the spring of this year, and the loss of national tax was 500,000 to 600,000. Huai private salt earns tens of times the profit by selling to Jiangsu, which has a huge impact and endless troubles. It is learned that Chief Wen of the Anti-Smuggling Department intends to mobilize 10 battalions of officers and soldiers from Huainan, Huaibei, and the five districts of Jiangsu to go to Yancheng, Funing, and Haizhou immediately to fundamentally block and stop the private ships from gathering. I am sorry that Director Feng will bear the heavy task of command. We believe that he will be able to stop the private salt from coming south. Today's swearing-in ceremony is held here. Next, Wang Shoushan gave a speech, roughly saying that President Zhou has explained the situation of private salt smuggling in the five districts of Jiangsu and the current important anti-smuggling affairs that should be handled. Salt affairs and anti-smuggling rely on a thorough plan, especially on sufficient strength. There are not many officers and soldiers in the five districts of Jiangsu, but the guns and ammunition are dilapidated and the salaries are insufficient, which is quite a restraint on the reform. At present, we should supplement the fine and sharp guns and ammunition, and at the same time, the officers and soldiers should appropriately increase the new salaries. With sufficient strength, we can stop the smuggling of private salt smugglers, and other rectification can be solved easily. Next, Liu Chunpu gave a speech. I have not seen the achievements of Director Feng in handling anti-smuggling in the past, but I will not exaggerate. However, he handled the prohibition of opium and protection of shipping in Jiangsu Province in Shanghai in the past year, and the achievements were remarkable. It is more difficult to prohibit opium than salt affairs. If opium can be stopped and blocked, salt affairs will definitely have more achievements. Next, Representative Tang Muyao of the Transportation Deputy and Representative He Zhenping of the County Party Department gave speeches one after another, mostly praising and encouraging. Finally, Director Feng replied, roughly saying that I was ordered by the Minister of Finance to be transferred from Southern Anhui to the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Five Districts of Jiangsu. Today, I will hold a supplementary swearing-in ceremony. I am deeply grateful to the Supervising Official, the representatives, and the guests for their presence and encouragement. The five districts of Jiangsu are an important area of land and water in the country. The smuggling of private salt from the north and south has a great impact on the national tax. I have not achieved any success in handling anti-smuggling in recent years. This time, I was ordered to come here. I will abide by the national laws and the teachings of the Supervising Official, the representatives, and the guests to work hard to rectify the anti-smuggling in order to increase the national tax. I hope that you, gentlemen, will guide and supervise me at any time so that I will not fail. I would like to thank you very much. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Consul General Formally Notified the Foreign Affairs Office</p>
<p>Portuguese newly appointed ambassador to China, Dr. Bartci, was invited by the governor of Macau on his way to China to assume his new post. Mr. and Mrs. Bartci went to Macau to welcome the Portuguese residents. He suddenly died in Macau the day before yesterday. Chen Shiguang, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited the Portuguese Consul General, Mr. Britto, at the Portuguese Consulate yesterday morning at 11:00 to inquire whether this news was true. Mr. Britto said that he received a telegram from Hong Kong saying that it was true. At 3:30 yesterday afternoon, Mr. Britto personally visited the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Deputy Director Liu received him and formally reported that he had received an official report from Macau that the Portuguese new envoy had indeed died suddenly of a stroke in Macau the day before yesterday (the 4th). Deputy Director Liu, in addition to expressing his condolences, telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang to report the news. It is reported that Dr. Bartci was 60 years old. He served as Consul in Guangzhou 15 years ago and is currently the Director of the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This time, he was ordered to come to China as his second term as an ambassador abroad.</p>

<p>Reduce the Fare of the Chao-Shan Railway</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Railways of the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, stating that the case of the Chao-Shan Railway fare being changed to silver dollars has been repeatedly telegraphed by the Bureau and the Federation to maintain the old system and continue to use silver cents. Later, the Civil Service Office of the National Government approved the Ministry of Railways' reply, stating that in order to comply with public opinion, the railway has been ordered to temporarily change the third-class ticket price from 7 silver dollars to 6.5 silver dollars, etc., and forwarded the letter to the Federation, which then notified the public. Now, it is reported that Chao-Shan citizens Xu Zongyan and others collectively telegraphed that the Chao-Shan Railway fare was originally high and more expensive than any railway in the country. For example, the state-owned Canton-Samshui Railway charges 2 silver cents for a third-class ticket for 30 miles. The Chao-Shan Railway should charge 5.5 silver cents for 80 miles. It now charges 7 silver cents, which is 1.5 silver cents more expensive. The Ministry of Railways said that the price it set has a deficit compared to the standard price set by the Ministry, which is really incomprehensible. 1. The Canton-Samshui Railway, the Canton-Kowloon Railway, and the Yuehan Railway currently charge silver cents. The Chao-Shan Railway is the only one that wants to change to silver dollars, which is extremely illegal. The Ministry of Railways said that the silver dollars are the method set by the Ministry and are uniform throughout the country. Since they are uniform throughout the country, why are the Canton-Samshui Railway, the Canton-Kowloon Railway, and the Yuehan Railway not uniform? Are these three railways not within the scope of the Ministry of Railways? This is obviously a state-owned railway, which is really incomprehensible. 2. Please telegraph and appeal to continue to collect silver cents before the national currency system is unified, and reduce the third-class ticket price to 5.5 silver cents according to the proportion of the Canton-Samshui Railway ticket fare. The second-class and first-class tickets and the fares of each station should be reduced proportionally, etc., in order to relieve the merchants and the people. We still implore you to telegraph a reply to show your compliance. President Lin Kanghou, Standing Committee Member Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, Peng Chuzhi, etc. of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China respectfully request your consideration.</p>

<p>On National Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province, stating that in order to facilitate transportation, long-distance bus companies should operate daily according to the prescribed hours and should not be interrupted. Recently, it has been found that long-distance bus companies in various provinces often suspend operations and rest on National Day, which is inconsistent with the purpose of facilitating transportation. It is ordered that the Department forward this order to all highway bureaus and long-distance bus companies under its jurisdiction for compliance. In the future, they should still operate as usual on National Day to avoid interruption of transportation, etc. In addition to issuing orders, it is ordered that the County Magistrate forward this order to all long-distance bus companies under his jurisdiction for compliance. The County Government has forwarded the order to all companies under its jurisdiction for compliance yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Wusong Chamber of Commerce to be Wound Up <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Future Change to Branch Office</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee sent a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the Committee's 47th Standing Committee meeting determined that Article 5 of the Chamber of Commerce Law states, "However, prosperous districts and towns may also independently or jointly establish chambers of commerce," and Article 8 of the same law states, "Chambers of commerce shall establish offices within their regions, and may establish branch offices if deemed necessary due to special circumstances with the resolution of a members' meeting." The meeting discussed which article should be used as the basis for reorganizing the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, which is located within the city's jurisdiction, and requested instructions from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. It was noted that on May 12, a reply was received from the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, No. 3774, stating that a letter was received requesting instructions on whether the Wusong Chamber of Commerce should be allowed to continue to be established as a chamber of commerce or whether it should be reorganized as a branch office of the Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It was noted that the town had long been incorporated into the Special Municipality's jurisdiction, and its proximity to your Chamber of Commerce and convenient transportation suggested that it was not necessary to establish a separate chamber. It would be more appropriate to establish a branch office to promote commercial interests while maintaining a unified organization. In accordance with the reply, you are requested to comply with the instructions. Furthermore, at the Committee's 50th Standing Committee meeting on May 15, it was discussed and resolved to forward a letter to your Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it be wound up and handed over to the Committee immediately. It will be decided at the Chamber of Commerce's general meeting whether to establish a branch office to comply with the legal system. Accordingly, a letter is hereby sent for your information and compliance. To the Wusong Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Municipal Government Orders Strict Enforcement of Opium Ban <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government approved the request from the Anti-Opium Commission, stating that, in order to strictly enforce the opium ban and quickly seek to aid opium addicts, in accordance with Chapter 5, Article 15 of the Opium Ban Enforcement Regulations, all senior local governments should supervise their subordinate anti-opium agencies to strictly investigate and prohibit the smoking of opium or its substitutes within their jurisdictions. Once discovered, in addition to sending the offenders to court for punishment according to law, those with opium addiction should be ordered to quit within a specified period. This was submitted to the 38th Committee meeting for discussion, which was passed and sent for approval. The Municipal Government then immediately instructed the Public Security and Health Bureaus to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Municipal Government Requests Abolition of Wusong Ship Tax <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>In this city, ship taxes are collected by an office established by the Finance Bureau, while Wusong also has a Wusong Sand Fishing Boat Tax Bureau. Shipowners generally feel burdened by the double taxation. Previously, shipowners such as Lu Yuankai and others submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to review and exempt one of the taxes. The Ministry of Finance ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to investigate and discuss the matter. Bureau Chief Xu Fu investigated and found that in December of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Executive Yuan issued the "National Financial Conference's Standards for Dividing National and Local Revenue," and ship tax was listed as the seventh item under local revenue. It is very clear that ship tax is a local tax. Since it is a local tax, it should naturally be collected by the local government. Wusong is under the jurisdiction of this city, so all ships that enter and dock at Wusong, whether they stay for a long time for trade or transit to the Yangtze River, are within the city's jurisdiction. Therefore, the collection of ship tax by the Municipal Government is naturally the obvious thing to do. If the ship tax collected by the Wusong Sand Fishing Boat Tax Bureau is indeed a national tax, then after the "Standards for Dividing National and Local Revenue" were passed and promulgated in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), ship tax belonged to local revenue, and there should no longer be any national tax collection. The ship tax collected by the Wusong Bureau has fundamentally ceased to exist and should have been abolished long ago. If the tax collected by the bureau is a Jiangsu local tax, it should especially not be collected by an agency established within the jurisdiction of this city, as it would be an intrusion. Not only would ships be subject to two taxes at the same time, causing hardship to merchants, but it would also confuse the administrative authority of the province and the city. Therefore, based on the previous submission, the Municipal Government requested the Ministry of Finance to order the abolition of the Wusong Sand Fishing Boat Tax Bureau.</p>

<p>Thirty-Sixth Meeting</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal General Labor Union held its 36th Standing Committee meeting on the morning of the 5th. Lu Jingshi, Li Yongxiang, Zhang Yaoming, Xu Shaochuan, Gu Yongquan, Zhou Xuexiang, and Tang Junsheng were present. Lu Jingshi chaired the meeting, and Liu Yunqian served as the secretary. The meeting proceeded with formalities as usual. The following matters were discussed: (1) The West Shanghai Textile Mill Labor Union Reorganization Committee submitted a request to audit and close the case, as they have advanced over 300 yuan in expenses since starting operations. The meeting resolved to forward the request to the Municipal Civic Training Committee. (2) Xu Fuquan and other worker representatives from the Chunhua Rubber Factory submitted a request to be allowed to organize a labor union to promote their welfare. After the Guidance Section investigated and reported that the number of workers at the factory met the requirements of the Labor Union Organization Regulations, it was requested that the Municipal Civic Training Committee be asked to approve the organization. The meeting resolved to approve the request. (3) The Guidance Section reported on the process of reconciling the dismissal of workers at the Chunhua Rubber Factory and requested to submit the report to the Municipal Civic Training Committee for record. The meeting resolved to approve the request. (4) Liu Qingsheng and other worker representatives from the Dongya Hemp Bag Factory submitted a request to be allowed to organize a labor union. The meeting resolved to forward the request to the Municipal Civic Training Committee and issue a reply. (5) The Standing Committee suggested that the preparatory work of the Committee had been completed and that another request should be submitted to the Municipal Executive Committee to issue the Organizational Outline of the Municipal General Labor Union as soon as possible. (6) [Omitted]. (7) The Edison Electric Material Factory Labor Union submitted a request to negotiate for the release of Executive Committee member Bu Xianyou, who was detained without cause.

<p>Shanghai Residents Urgently Rescue</p>
<h3 id="e150">Two Million Disaster Victims in Shaanxi <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Three Yuan Saves a Life</p>
<p>Heaven's misfortune has struck Shaanxi province. Since the 17th year of the Republic (1928), there has been continuous drought. Since last year, the disaster situation has worsened, with vast areas of barren land and no harvests. According to on-site investigation reports from various charitable organizations, the disaster areas are characterized by desolate fields, deserted villages with nine out of ten homes empty, and people dying and fleeing. Villages are deserted, beds are filled with unburied corpses, and roads are covered with starving people. Birds and dogs are devouring the corpses, a scene too terrible to witness. For three years, Shaanxi province has suffered from drought, and last winter, it suffered from snow disasters. The snow was over four or five feet deep, and even flying birds died along with the livestock. The starving people cried day and night in the icy and snowy conditions, shivering and starving under straw heaps and thatched huts. Suffering from both hunger and cold, countless people died from freezing and starvation every day. Since the beginning of spring, the situation has worsened as the food supply has been exhausted. At first, disaster victims sold their houses and slept in the wild to survive. Then, they sold their wives and children and cooked their children for food. Old and weak couples wandered along the roads, weeping and wailing in misery. This situation and scene makes us heartbroken. The survivors are all emaciated and scrawny, their voices hoarse and weak, and they collapse and die with a single stumble. They eat all the grass and tree bark, and even swallow stone flour (i.e., Guanyin clay), which leads to poisoning and death. Even cannibalism has occurred, just like the savages in Africa. Moreover, the disaster area is full of corpses, and the stench is overwhelming. As a result, epidemics are rampant in the spring, and the survivors are suffering from further disasters. This is a disaster rarely seen by mankind, but the people of Shaanxi are experiencing it all. According to investigations, the number of people who have died from starvation and disease has exceeded three million, and the number of displaced people is no less than five million. This is truly a great catastrophe in China, a rare disaster in history. There are now more than two million survivors crying out for help. If they are not provided with emergency relief, they will eventually starve to death. Last month, charitable organization representatives Zhu Qinglan, Li Zushen, and disaster victim representative Liu Zhizhou personally went to Shaanxi province to investigate and witnessed a situation even more tragic than reported in the newspapers. Their initial plan was to transport relief grain directly to Shaanxi province, but due to the long distance and inconvenient transportation, it would take more than a month to arrive. The relief would be too slow to help the desperate situation. Therefore, as a temporary measure, the only option is to purchase grain locally to barely sustain life. Then, wait for the relief grain to be transported in to continue the relief efforts. Currently, the price of grain in Shaanxi province is three yuan per dou (peck), and one person needs one dou of rice per month. Therefore, three yuan can save a life. We are still waiting for people from all walks of life to generously donate to support this life-saving cause. People in North China, including Tianjin and Beijing, were moved by the tragedy of the disaster and organized organizations such as the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Emergency Committee. Newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao and Yong Pao held emergency relief publicity weeks to collect donations. Such publicity inspired people and appealed to all circles, who responded with enthusiasm and contributed generously. Young students voluntarily saved their food expenses, and poor workers donated their hard-earned money. Some even pawned their clothes and sold their belongings to donate. Merchants, scholars, and women also generously donated large sums of money. Although the donors came from different classes and backgrounds, they all contributed their best, from as little as a dime to as much as tens of thousands of yuan. Their righteousness is admirable. Now, we are making further efforts to raise funds more widely and organize ten-person disaster relief groups. The method is simple and easy to implement. Every ten people form a group, and each member of each group forms another group. In this way, one becomes ten, ten becomes a hundred, a hundred becomes a thousand, and a thousand becomes ten thousand. Within a few days, a very large disaster relief group can be formed. Each person donates one yuan for relief and is responsible for introducing at least ten new members within 24 hours. In this way, a large sum of money can be collected in a short period of time. Currently, 6 million yuan is needed to save the two million disaster victims. Although the Tianjin and Beijing areas have been raising funds, the donors have already made their best efforts, but the amount is still a drop in the bucket in the disaster area. Moreover, three yuan per life is calculated based on one month's worth of food. After one month, even if the new wheat harvest is somewhat hopeful, only a small portion of the disaster victims will be able to support themselves. The vast majority of the disaster victims have no money. Therefore, we hope that all circles in Shanghai will understand the extremely serious situation in the disaster area. Those who have not responded to the emergency relief efforts in Tianjin and Beijing must not sit idly by. They must fulfill their humanitarian duty of mutual assistance, rise up quickly, save all entertainment and consumption expenses, and quickly work hard to donate. Donating three more yuan means saving one more life. No matter how difficult and challenging our current situation is, it is still better and more comfortable than the Shaanxi disaster victims in the hell on earth. Let each do their best and not worry that the disaster is too great or the effort is too small, but simply seek peace of mind. Donations can be directly remitted to General Zhu Ziqiao of the North China Disaster Relief Association in Tianjin. The two million Shaanxi compatriots who are on the verge of death are looking forward to it with longing. We hope that the people of South China will inspire their conscience, encourage each other, and work together to promote this righteous cause. If people are kind, who is not like us? We should be eager and brave to act quickly to provide assistance. Then, the two million survivors will have years of gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Sino-Foreign Relief Society Held Board Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Society held a board meeting yesterday, which resolved that because the number of people starving to death in Shaanxi is increasing daily, with only five million people remaining in the entire province, including 200,000 beggars and one million sick people, and because Hanzhong has repeatedly telegraphed for emergency assistance, 15,000 yuan will be allocated, with half going to the Sino-Foreign Relief Society in Xi'an and half to the Sino-Foreign Relief Society in Hanzhong, to assist with relief needs. Also, in view of the difficulties in carrying out relief work in Henan Province due to the addition of military forces and famine, 5,000 yuan will be allocated to assist with immigration and border colonization. This year, Singaporean merchant Hu Wenhu donated eleven large boxes of Vicks Vapor Rub and other medicines in response to the epidemic in the disaster area. The Society is applying for passports to transport them to the various disaster areas. It was also decided to send 5,000 yuan to Gansu, where the wheat harvest is still some time away. In addition, 3,000 yuan was allocated to Lujiang Prefecture in Anhui, where the drought is more severe and the number of people starving to death is increasing daily, as a token of relief. It is reported that the Society has allocated a total of more than 185,000 yuan for relief since this spring.</p>

<p>There are still eleven people... Register quickly</p>
<p>The May 30th Massacre Family Association is about to end after the distribution of condolences. However, it has been found that there are still injured comrades (according to the investigation form of deaths and injuries in the May 30th case prepared by the former Chamber of Commerce): Wang Yougai, Yu Maohuai, Wei Chunting, Chen Yunqiu, Xu Ruihe, Wang Ruping, Liu Shaoxian, Yu Guanzhu, Ma Mijun, Li Yixun, and Mei Zhonglin. They have not registered yet. Yesterday, the secretary Zhou Zaisheng and clerk Sun Guangfu were specially dispatched to investigate the addresses of the injured comrades on the form and urge them to register with the Family Association to receive condolences. However, when Zhou and Sun went to the addresses, they found no one at any of the addresses. Both Lin also claimed that they did not know them. They had to return to the association to report their futile trip. It is reported that the Family Association plans to find a way to make them register and receive condolences before the deadline for closure.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianguo ship, which was sailing to Hankou, suddenly had its rudder damaged while in Nanjing. At that time, the crew announced that it could not sail to Hankou, and the passengers on board protested loudly and refunded their tickets to take other ships. The crew's persuasion was ineffective, and they had to refund all the passenger tickets. The business director suffered a huge loss. After the ship was repaired in Nanjing, it continued to operate as usual. Therefore, it arrived in Shanghai one day later this time. It has now resumed its normal schedule.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Seventeen-Year-Old Girl <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Captures a Robber</p>
<p>Old Woman Shouts for Help from Rooftop</p>
<p>Girl's Bravery is Commendable</p>
<p>At around 9:45 PM the night before last, a robbery occurred at the Chen residence near Fangbang Bridge, Minguo Road, French Concession. A seventeen-year-old girl from the Chen household single-handedly captured a robber on the spot, and another was intercepted at the Huacheng Road intersection after being chased. Although it is a minor incident, it is rare in recent society for a weak seventeen-year-old girl to capture a robber. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Prosperous Incense in the Buddha Hall: Chen Liansheng, a local resident, 54 years old, lives at No. 568 near Fangbang Bridge, Minguo Road, French Concession. The house is a single-bay shop facing the street. Chen and his family live upstairs. A Buddha hall is set up downstairs to treat all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. In reality, it is a disguised witch doctor.</p>
<p>The walls of the house are hung with plaques, and the incense is quite prosperous, which has attracted the attention of thieves.</p>
<p>Six Robbers Arrive Suddenly: At 9:45 PM the night before last, after the Chen family had dinner, everyone was resting and preparing to go to bed. Suddenly, six robbers of varying heights and wearing black arrived. Three robbers had guns, and one robber blocked the door as a lookout. Five robbers rushed in together. Chen's seventeen-year-old second daughter, Genbao, was downstairs tidying up chores. A robber pointed a gun and forbade her from making a sound, and then snatched the gold bracelet from Genbao's left arm.</p>
<p>Shouting for Help from the Terrace: At that time, Genbao saw that there were many robbers and that they all had guns, so she had to submit to them. She was driven to the upstairs room with all seven or eight people in the house confined in one room. The robbers then ransacked the chests and cabinets at will. Chen's wife, Zhang, although over forty years old, was naturally alert. Seeing that the robbers were focused on robbing money, she secretly opened the upstairs window and climbed over to the terrace of the neighboring house, shouting for help. A hundred people responded, and immediately the police whistle sounded loudly.</p>
<p>Bravely Knocking Down a Thief: Seeing that things were not going well, the robbers went downstairs together to escape. Just as the last robber rushed down the stairs, Chen's daughter, Genbao, followed closely behind and bravely stepped forward to knock the robber to the ground. The robber could not resist. At the same time, neighbors rushed over, and he surrendered. He was found to have no gun on him. Everyone on the scene was shouting about Genbao's danger.

<p>Southeast Xinda Brick Kiln Factory</p>
<h3 id="e158">Workers Surround Police <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>White Fruit Village Robbed and Pillaged</p>
<p>Brick Factory Workers Suspected</p>
<p>Police Investigating Surrounded</p>
<p>Outnumbered, They Were Beaten</p>
<p>At approximately 11 PM the night before last, forty to fifty bandits suddenly appeared in the Dahetou area of Baiguo Village, Tangwan, in the Second District of Shanghai County. They were armed with carrying poles, kitchen knives, iron bars, and flashing flashlights in all directions.</p>
<p>Surrounding the village, they broke into homes and plundered in several directions. The village chief, Kang Ximin, and five other households, including Gong Xuetang, were robbed of silver dollars, clothing, and jewelry worth over a thousand gold pieces. After the bandits had their fill of looting, they carried the stolen goods towards the Xinda Brick Kiln Factory to the southeast and fled. Subsequently, Gong Xuetang, the victim, urgently reported to the local County Public Security Third Branch Police Station and the County Defense Corps Second District, requesting an investigation and arrest. Now, according to villagers from Han Family Wooden Bridge, about half a mile east of the robbed village, on the night in question, they were threshing rice in the fields when they saw people dressed in short clothes,</p>
<p>Resembling Workers, numbering several dozens, all speaking with Shandong Jiangbei accents, passing by towards the kiln factory. After receiving the report, the police station and others investigated and determined that there were no wealthy families in the Dahetou area and that there was no reason for outside bandits to covet the area. It was clearly the work of local people, and the victims also said that they seemed to recognize several of the perpetrators. Therefore, the workers in the kiln factory were highly suspected. The next day, Patrol Officer Wang Jun from the station, along with Gong Xianglin, the deputy commander of the corps, led police officers and corps members to the kiln factory. They first explained the reason to the factory manager, He Peicang, and then</p>
<p>Entered the Factory to Search. Unexpectedly, as soon as the workers saw the sudden appearance of the police officers and corps members, they panicked and became stubbornly defiant. With a shout, all four to five hundred workers in the factory grabbed clubs and</p>
<p>Surrounded and Beaten the Police and Corps Members, and threw bricks and stones indiscriminately. Although the police officers and corps members were all armed with firearms, they were no match for the crowd, and all were beaten and injured. Patrol Officer Wang and the corps commander</p>
<p>Were the Most Seriously Injured, and their breathing was weak. The factory manager, knowing that he had caused a great disturbance, not only comforted the police officers and corps members but also immediately sent Wang and the other person to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. According to the doctors, the injuries of the two were very serious, and there was a risk to their lives. Zhao, the chief of the branch, upon hearing the report, immediately prepared a document and reported it to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Director Shen dispatched personnel to the village to investigate the situation in order to</p>
<p>Strictly Apprehend the Stolen Goods and Thieves for Interrogation. He also ordered factory manager He Peicang to hand over the perpetrators to be brought to justice and punished.</p>

<p>Boy Kidnapped in Yancheng</p>
<p>Transferred and Hidden in Shanghai</p>
<p>You Botang Searched Diligently</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued Only the Day Before</p>
<p>At around 6 PM the day before yesterday, Captain Lu of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau Detective Team dispatched detectives Qi Haitian and Zhang Guangsen to the Sixth District Police Station of Caojiadu in Western Shanghai, where they joined Patrol Officer Wang to</p>
<p>Lead Police Officers and Detective Foreman Liu Shaoxiang to rescue a hostage boy from house number 149 of Lu Xue's residence and arrest two male and female criminals guarding the hostage. The details of the kidnapping and the cracking of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Boy Kidnapped. You Botang, 26 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangbei, has made a living by farming and is quite frugal, so his family is considered well-off. He has a wife and a son named Da Heshang, who is only six years old and much loved by You. Unexpectedly, at around 9 PM on the twelfth night of the first lunar month this year, two kidnappers suddenly scaled the wall and entered with great force. Without asking any questions, they snatched his son Da Heshang and left. Inquiring about their whereabouts, You was extremely anxious about his kidnapped son. Although he later received several letters from the kidnappers demanding ransom, he was unable to raise the huge sum of money and did not respond. Instead, he inquired about the whereabouts of the kidnappers and the hostage's hiding place until the middle of last month when he</p>
<p>Learned that the boy had been hidden in Shanghai. You then came to Shanghai from his hometown and resided at the home of a friend at number 82, Hengfeng Lane, Dong Wuchang Road, Hongkou, to conduct investigations. On the morning of the day before, he received a report that his son was still hidden at number 149 of Lu Xue's residence on Bailinan Road in Western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hostage Rescued. After learning this, You reported to Captain Lu of the Special City Public Security Bureau Detective Team, as the place was within the Chinese Concession. Captain Lu immediately dispatched detectives Qi Haitian and Zhang Guangsen, along with the reporter You Botang, to report the situation to the Sixth District Police Station of Caojiadu in Western Shanghai, requesting the dispatch of police to assist in the arrest. District Chief Ren ordered Patrol Officer Wang Yaochen to lead police officers and accompany the personnel to the address, where they indeed found the hostage boy inside. They immediately stepped forward to rescue him and arrested two male and female criminals guarding the hostage. They were taken back to the district, where District Chief Ren interrogated them separately. According to the male criminal, Jia Tongnian, 44 years old, from Yancheng, who worked as a rickshaw puller, the boy was entrusted to him by Zheng Zhusan to watch over and raise, and he was paid fifteen yuan a month. He said that the house was rented through the introduction of Xue San and Xu Shitai. According to the female criminal, Wang, 44 years old, who currently works at the Xinchang Silk Factory, Tongnian is her husband and the boy was entrusted to them by someone; she knows nothing else. After obtaining the confessions, District Chief Ren handed over the two criminals and the hostage to the detectives to be taken back to the team for interrogation.</p>
<p>Continued Detention of Landlords. At around 1 PM yesterday, District Chief Ren believed that the landlord who hid the hostage was quite involved and ordered Detective Foreman Liu Shaoxiang to take detectives Dai Yuanqing, Zhu Fengshan, and Gan Youxin to the house to arrest the two landlords, Cao Xiaoyu, and the people who introduced the rental, Xue San and Xu Shitai. They were taken back to the station, where District Chief Ren interrogated them. According to Cao, 37 years old, from Funing, he has always worked as a handyman. According to Xue, the introducer, 30 years old, from Yancheng, who lives at number 30, Caojiazhai, he works as a telephone craftsman. According to Xu, 33 years old, from Yancheng, he works as a rickshaw puller. The documents were then prepared and submitted to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Boat Crew Managed to Rescue Her</p>
<p>She Refuses to Say Why She Was World-Weary</p>
<p>At around 7 AM yesterday morning, a young woman with short hair boarded a ferry at the Dongjiadu Wharf in the South City to cross the Huangpu River. When the boat reached the center of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the boat crew was quick-witted and immediately managed to rescue her. Upon reaching Pudong, the boat crew handed the woman over to the police on duty, who took her to the Third Branch of the Third District Police Station and transferred her to the Third Branch of the Third District Police Station in Tangqiao Town for interrogation. She claimed to be Shi Xiaodi, 19 years old, a local. She lost her parents at a young age and lives with her brother-in-law, Wang Xinsheng, at number 6, Xinchang Lane, Maoshan Temple, Xiaonanmen, relying on her brother-in-law for support. Wang runs a grain business on Dou Market Street in the South City. She also said that she was not mistreated. When the chief of the station asked her why she was world-weary and committed suicide, she firmly refused to say, only saying that she was suffering from an incurable illness and therefore took this action. The chief of the station then instructed the police officer to borrow a set of dry clothes for her to change into and ordered the police to go to the address and bring Wang Xinsheng to the station to take Shi back.</p>
<p>A Concubine Sues the Principal Wife</p>
<h3 id="e162">Requesting a One-Time Alimony Payment <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Calculated at a Monthly Rate of 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Demanding 81,600 Yuan</p>
<p>A certain Zhang from Haining was a wealthy merchant in Shanghai who passed away last winter, leaving behind one wife and one concubine. The wife, Shen Yunhe, is 35 years old and lives on Datong Road. She has children. The concubine, Xu Zhuzhen, is 39 years old and has been married to Zhang for ten years without any offspring. After Zhang's death, the principal wife and the concubine could not get along, so the concubine moved to her mother's home at number 637, North Suzhou Road, and hired a lawyer to sue the principal wife, demanding a one-time alimony payment of 81,600 yuan. The calculation method is based on her age of 26 at the time of the lawsuit, assuming a lifespan of 60 years, she still has 34 years to live. Zhang had promised to give her 200 yuan per month, which is 2,400 yuan per year, so for 34 years, she should receive 81,600 yuan. The case had been summoned for hearing twice, with instructions to settle out of court. The defendant, Shen Yunhe, then asked her father, Mr. Shen, to represent her in negotiations with the plaintiff. Xu Zhuzhen, persuaded by relatives, shortened the term to ten years and demanded a lump sum payment of over 26,000 yuan, including the monthly fees owed from before and the litigation costs. However, Shen believed that although she controlled the property left by her husband after his death, she still had children to support. The concubine was only supporting herself, so why would she need this huge sum? Therefore, she did not agree to the concubine's settlement conditions. Thus, the case was returned to the legal path. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong of the Special District District Court continued the trial. According to the plaintiff, Xu Zhuzhen, her husband, Zhang Zhenyi, had promised to give her 200 yuan per month, and from November of the 17th year to January of the 18th year, she received the full amount. After that, no month was paid in full. According to the defendant, Shen Yunhe, although her husband initially promised to give her 200 yuan per month, he changed it to 100 yuan per month in January of the 18th year, and only two months' worth of fees were not paid since January. From March onwards, she gave 100 yuan per month. The reason why the plaintiff previously demanded 200 yuan per month was that she had secretly taken away the stocks and other securities of the Zhongnan Bank while her husband was ill. After her husband recovered and found out, he hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to send a letter to the bank, stating that and asking the plaintiff to hand them over. She then took the opportunity to make a request. However, the plaintiff is an individual, and her food, clothing, and shelter are all provided for. Her husband therefore reduced the monthly payment to 100 yuan, and I still respected his will and paid it monthly. If she really wants a one-time payment, I can only give her four or five thousand yuan at most. Finally, Zhang's cousin, surnamed Shen, testified in court, saying that he was also present when his cousin promised to give the plaintiff 200 yuan, but he did not know how it was reduced to 100 yuan. Since the two sides had no possibility of reconciliation, Judge Xu ordered the lawyers on both sides to begin their arguments and then ordered a recess for a scheduled pronouncement.</p>

<p>Both Sides Were Injured</p>
<p>The manufacturing plant of Tianyiwei Mother Food Company is located at 784 Taopeng Road. The property is owned by Jicheng Silver Company. Tianyi wanted to expand the factory, so they negotiated with the rental office to rent four adjacent houses. Although the lessor had agreed to give them a certain fee, those involved were unwilling. During the Dragon Boat Festival, a man surnamed Zhang went to the Tianyi factory to extort 50 yuan on the pretext, but failed. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 3 PM, he gathered dozens of people, each armed with ironware, and rushed into the factory to make trouble. However, there were also dozens of workers in the factory, and the two sides were evenly matched, so a fight broke out. As a result, two workers, Ma Fei, were injured on the factory side, and Chen Ruian's head was injured on the other side. The Huishan Police, upon hearing the report, sent detectives to the scene, and they dispersed. Only the injured Chen Ruian was captured and sent to the Special District District Court yesterday morning.

The mother and daughter met when the woman begged in that area. Unexpectedly, Xiao'er, having had a good time, did not recognize her mother. The woman was very angry and reported to the police, who arrested Chen Bingnian and Qiu Xiao'er and took them to the Sixth District Police Station. They were sent to the District Court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Wife Having an Affair with Someone, Charged <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Adulterer Fled Without a Trace</p>
<p>Hong Yuhui, from Hangzhou, married Wang Yafeng as his wife for two years. The woman is now thirty-one years old. After coming to Shanghai from Hangzhou, she was first introduced to the Xian Shi Company Amusement Park as a tea server, but has recently stopped working. Hong, having learned that she had an affair with Liu Shanyong, a man from Ningbo, filed a lawsuit in the Special District District Court. The summons to open</p>
<p>The trial was skipped by Wang, who was in hiding. Only Liu was summoned to the case, ordering the payment of 500 yuan as bail pending trial. Unexpectedly, after Liu was released on bail, he knew that seducing another man's wife was illegal and would be punished by law. As he was going to be handcuffed and imprisoned, he took the opportunity to escape. When the court resumed the trial yesterday morning, Liu had flown away. Only Wang Yafeng was found by Hong and brought back to Shanghai from her original home. She was sent to the Huisi Police Station and transferred to the women's prison. Judge Ge proposed the case for interrogation yesterday, and the woman confessed that because her husband was unemployed and pawned off all her clothes and jewelry, she came to Shanghai and asked Liu to introduce her to a job. There was no ambiguity. Since April 27, she left the amusement park and lived with a girlfriend at Xinkang Lane, Datong Road, for a week before returning to Hangzhou. Her husband had previously received 30 yuan from Liu and promised not to pester her, but now he is suing again. The court ordered the defendant to be detained pending a retrial at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Economic Pressure Leads to Suicide by Smoke Inhalation <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yang Ayu, a local, 29 years old, recently committed suicide by inhaling raw smoke at 1 PM on the fourth afternoon due to economic pressure. She checked into room 19 of the Xinmin Hotel (small inn) at 389 Dong Zilaihuo Street, Edward Road, French Concession, and suddenly had a short-sighted idea. The manager of the hotel, Qian Azhu, learned of this and hired a car to send Yang to Renji Hospital. However, the smoke poison had spread deeply in her abdomen and she died despite medical treatment. The hospital reported to the police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuandong mortuary for an autopsy. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the police conducted an investigation and found no family members. The Criminal Division of the French Police reported to Judge Zhu Cheng of the French Public Hall yesterday and confirmed that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by poisoning herself. No relatives were found, so the court ordered photos to be taken and the body to be collected by the hall.</p>

<p>Trial of the Tragic Death of an Apprentice</p>
<p>The Apprentice Examined, No Wounds Found</p>
<p>Official Orders Defendant to Settle</p>
<p>Last year, Liu Caidong, the 13-year-old son of the widow Liu Mei from Wenzhou, was recommended by a friend to work as an apprentice at the Wanhua Cheng Laundry Shop, owned by Zhang Binghao, a fellow villager, located at No. 2 Jiuxing Lane, Jules Spears Road, in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, in April, while drying clothes in a nearby wasteland with the guest master, Hu Adong from Shaoxing, he was inadvertently kicked in the chest by Hu, resulting in injury. After returning to the shop, the owner was informed and treated him, but he continued to work as usual. However, on the afternoon of the 25th of last month, Liu suddenly died. The shop owner reported to the police, who arrested Hu. The body was sent to the morgue. After an examination by Judge Zhu of the French Concession Court, a Western doctor was ordered to conduct another examination. Yesterday, the police brought Hu to the French Concession Court for questioning. The Western Detective Chief reported that the Western doctor's examination found no injuries on the deceased, suggesting death due to illness. The plaintiff, Liu Mei, the deceased's mother, stated that her husband died early, and she had hoped this son would support her in old age. Now that he has been tragically kicked to death, she seeks justice. When questioned, Hu Adong confessed that he and Liu Caidong went to the wasteland to dry clothes that day. Because Caidong did not secure the rope ends to the wooden stakes, they were blown down by the wind. In a moment of anger, he kicked him, but the deceased continued to work as usual and did not appear injured. He claims he does not know how he died later. He begs for investigation. Judge Zhu ordered Hu to post bail and attempt to settle with the deceased's family. If no settlement is reached, he will be brought back to court for further investigation.</p>

<p>A French detective discovered that residents Zhang Meiting, Zhu Awu, and Xu Huasheng had privately set up gambling dens using "flower clubs" (a lottery-like gambling game) to lure people to gamble, violating the law. On the previous day, detectives were ordered to search the premises and confiscate flower club documents and silver coins, which were brought to the police station. Yesterday, they were handed over to the French Concession Court for investigation. The three defendants confessed to privately setting up gambling dens to lure people to gamble on flower clubs. Chinese and Western officials sentenced each to a fine of fifty silver dollars as a warning.</p>

<p>A few days ago, a man from Beiping named Gao Liangting went to the Huade Milk and Ice Company on Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai.</p>
<p>Claiming to be a patrol officer at the Sixth District Police Station, he was amiable and</p>
<p>eloquent. He first extorted one yuan from a clerk, Mr. Wei, and then attempted to extort money from the company. The company, suspecting he was an imposter, agreed to pay him five silver dollars on the afternoon of the 5th. Gao believed them and left, thanking them. Later, the company considered the situation and concluded that a patrol officer from the Sixth District would not openly extort money. They suspected an imposter and sent a representative to the Sixth District Police Station to report the matter. Upon receiving the report, Chief Ren of the district was furious that someone dared to impersonate a patrol officer and openly extort money. Yesterday, he dispatched police officers to the company to wait. Around 1 p.m., Gao returned and was immediately arrested and brought back to the station. Chief Ren questioned Gao Yuting, who confessed to being 32 years old from Beiping with no fixed address. He was evasive with further questioning. The case was documented and sent to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for investigation and punishment.</p>

<p>The Zhi Changxiang and four other shops, along with Yuchang Pawnshop, in the Public Concession had previously been summoned by the Special District Court on the 29th of last month for failing to affix stamp duty to invoices and pawn tickets, and were fined according to law. Jin Kang Pawnshop was not present at the initial summons and their case was rescheduled for the 5th of this month. It was previously reported. It has now been learned that the owner of Jin Kang Pawnshop was not in Shanghai at the time of the summons and was therefore unable to attend. On the 3rd of this month, Cheng Side, a representative from the Pawnshop Industry Association, presented a document to the Stamp Duty Bureau stating that the failure to affix stamp duty to the pawn tickets was a temporary error and requested leniency for the first offense. They pledged to purchase and affix stamps in the future. The representative also issued a written guarantee stating that they would accept penalties if they violated the regulations again. The police lawyer has now withdrawn the lawsuit against the pawnshop from the court.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's local social news section yesterday (the 4th), I found a report entitled "Water Police Painstakingly Suppress Pirates." The details described in the report are not in accordance with the facts. After investigating, it was discovered that the point of departure for all units under our jurisdiction (not just the Xupu Bund patrol boat) in suppressing the bandits was Dongxing Sha, where they engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits for four hours, killing more than ten bandits, capturing eight alive, and rescuing four hostages. A total of three guns were seized, one bandit ship was captured, and one was sunk. A special letter is requested for correction in order to ensure factual accuracy. I respectfully wish the editor of Shen Bao peace. Fourth District of the Jiangsu Water Police Department, June 5th.</p>

<p>Xu Peikun</p>
<p>Introduction: Since the sharp decline in silver exchange rates in Shanghai, the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood has been profound and significant. The harm to the economy is worse than floods and fierce beasts. We must plan carefully before it rains and prevent trouble before it happens. Since the beginning, I have suggested ways to prevent silver imports and gambling, aiming for this goal. Subsequently, due to practical obstacles, I variably advocated taxing silver imports, thereby curbing cash exports and gambling, hoping it would be easy to implement quickly and effectively, so that the nation's finances would be stable and the people's economy would be revitalized. Is this not a blessing for the country? This is the first condition that economic researchers should pay attention to in opening the discussion. In other words, the reason for rescuing the financial turmoil is nothing more than seeking to stabilize the nation's finances, make the economy healthier, and enrich the people's lives. It is not like the people of the time argued, analyzing from the exchange rate that there is a need to collect silver taxes, and from the wealth perspective, that there is no need to collect silver taxes. Therefore, we must clearly recognize that the purpose of the tax is to rescue the entire people's economy, not based on a partial reason. The collapse of our nation's economy has reached its extreme. If we always hold the feeling of being far from the high hall, like to exaggerate and use empty words without seeking truth from facts and reversing this tide, then in the tragic disaster of economic suicide, who will be responsible for it?

<h3 id="e195">Fudan Drama Society Performs Cyrano de Bergerac <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>On the 10th of this month, Liang He (Cyrano de Bergerac), this great play, was finally brought to the Chinese stage by the Fudan Drama Society on the 10th of this month. This is the only unmatched romantic play after Er'na Ni (Hernani) that rekindles the fiery passion of the romantic school in people's hearts. The romanticism that boldly brings the extremely rich poetry to the stage originally satisfied and comforted people for all the things that they could not obtain in the natural world, according to Bacon. He argued that the soul is higher than the real world. The soul needs a greatness, a goodness, a change that cannot be found in nature. Only in the art of the romantic school can these requirements be met. Even now, a group of romantic poets still use Bacon's statement as an excuse. Art is originally an escape from reality. A group of naturalists specialize in imitating nature and expressing all the shortcomings of nature, while romanticists obtain a kind of relief from the natural world. In comparison, this is of course far better.</p>
<p>The romantic movement is continuous as long as the youth of the world still exists, as long as the memory of youth is still preserved, as long as the curious mood still survives, the works of the romantic school will eventually exist.</p>
<p>Rostand's (Cyrano de Bergerac) is an excellent representative typical play of romantic works.</p>
<p>The protagonist Cyrano is a great poet of the seventeenth century and is extremely brave. However, he secretly falls in love with his cousin. However, his cousin Roxane does not pay much attention to him. His nose is so big and ugly that it makes her ignore the passion in his heart. Her heart completely tends to Christian, a simple soul without thought, eloquence, and passion. Cyrano restrains himself extremely. He not only avoids his rival, but he also helps him propose to her, making the two of them combined, and on the battlefield, he protects his rival like a son. Think about it, this is such an embarrassing thing. The person you love is taken away by others, and you still have to do everything possible to fulfill the good deeds of others in order to take care of the happiness of the person you love.</p>
<p>However, after Christian dies, our hero Cyrano still constrains his love for Roxane. He still secretly endures his passion. He does not give any hint at all. Until the very end, when he is about to die, he reveals the words in the last letter written in Christian's name to her. Only then does Roxane know all the details. However, Cyrano always denies that he ever loved her, and dies like that.</p>
<p>The moving part of this play is mostly due to its</p>
<p>unpredictability, the rapid movements, the incredible courage, the sudden arrival of the heroine from a difficult journey to the military camp, Cyrano's impossible restraint for fourteen years after Christian's death - all are as moving as legends and not like those absurd legends. The facts in it are not incredible.</p>
<p>(Cyrano de Bergerac) is not only rich in romantic colors in terms of characters and themes, but also rich in passion in terms of the scenes and poetry. We only need to look at the scene where Cyrano forbids the actor from taking the stage in the theater and duels with the viscount who mocked his nose, and the scene where Cyrano helps his rival propose to Roxane on the moonlit platform, she looks at Christian's beautiful body and listens to Cyrano's moving words - under such a dark night, thinking about it is so seductive.</p>
<h3 id="e196">After Watching (The Merchant of Venice) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Mei</p>
<p>The sensational (Merchant of Venice) has now become</p>
<p>a thing of the past. Needless to say, it has left a deep page of glory in the history of the Drama Society's performance, with the same value as (The Second Rosary) once performed by the society. It is also difficult to obliterate in the minds of our audience.</p>
<p>The members of the Drama Society are obviously willing to accept people's criticisms with an open mind. They said this (If you don't see it well, please tell us that the clumsy triers have pointers for improvement). The pointer is indeed not worthy, but I will write down what I saw and felt at the time roughly below.</p>
<p>The artistic performance of all the actors still has considerable skill. Among them, Shen Tongjun's Shylock is the most wonderful. It can be said that he is extremely good. His expression in the scene in the Venetian court is so difficult to perform, but Mr. Shen performed it so meticulously. It is difficult to describe in words. Yu Xiuyun's Portia is not bad, but it is a pity that she speaks too fast, and in many places, she does not have time to express her spirit. It can be said that there are shortcomings in the beauty. As for Huang Yimei's Antonio, he seems to be slightly slow. There are also a few people whose Mandarin is not accurate and pure enough. The Merchant of Venice was originally not easy to perform, especially when it was moved to Shanghai with its exotic atmosphere. Now that there are such achievements, it is really not easy. With the hard work of the society, it is enough to comfort itself.</p>
<p>However, they are willing to accept people's sincere</p>
<p>advice with an open mind, so I will not be polite and say a few sincere words with a sincere attitude.</p>
<p>We will not perform foreign foreign plays, but if we adopt them, of course we hope to move the play from the script to the stage. You must not have the slightest scruples, otherwise you will lose its true color, which is also one of the reasons why we love to watch foreign films but are not satisfied with Chinese films. When Bassanio proposed to Portia and succeeded, how happy was Bassanio! And how willing was Portia! He was so happy that he wanted to hug her photo and shout good things! Beauty, angel! She also said many good things to him!</p>
<p>I am yours, from now on, I will give everything to you. Then she gave him a valuable ring on her hand as a permanent commemoration of their engagement. At this moment, this beautiful moment, this moment so worthy of commemoration, at least there should be a longer sweet kiss and embrace. This is a lifetime affair, and there is no need to discuss it. But they just put it aside indifferently and performed it without even touching their hands. This is such a pity and disappointment to the audience. But why do Ms. Yu and Mr. Chen, who do not love art, want to save this move? As for fearing that people will slander that China is not comparable to foreign countries, there is no need to worry about this. To put it bluntly, artistic people or people who love art will not come to slander. Unless it is that group of ordinary people, what is the criticism they make worthy of consideration? I advise Ms. Yu to release a little courageous spirit. I was a little dissatisfied when I saw it at the time. I thought there should be a hug and a kiss. Later, I went back and looked at the script, and it really should be there.</p>
<p>Also, in terms of makeup, although they are all Western clothes, I feel that it is a bit difficult to be realistic on the female body. The female characters in the play all look like Chinese women wearing Western clothes.</p>
<p>The chest and hips seem to be too flat and should be dressed plumply. In those days, Western girls had two sideburns on both sides of their hair. The author has seen this in many books.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this be too faithful? I don't know if the gentlemen of the Society agree.</p>

So, speculative students hired workers to build an ice skating rink at the back door of the university. Originally, only a few female students were happy to put on skates and skate on the smooth ground. Now that there is an ice skating rink, male students who are skilled in this way also go to join in the fun.</p>
<p>The ice skating rink of Fudan University opened the day before yesterday. The rink owner's mind is really good. He distributed invitations to all the students of the school on the occasion of the opening. After calculating, there are more than 1,500 students in the coming days. A total of 3,000 copies of invitations and envelopes were spent. This expense is not small.</p>
<p>The business was very good on the first day of opening because the tickets only cost two corners of a small ocean an hour and can be extended. At the same time, several female students who like to ice skate came to participate, and male students generally flocked to them like flies to carrion.</p>
<p>In the center of the ice skating rink, I only saw these butterfly-like female students speeding by. Mischievous male students deliberately blocked their way back and forth. Some even sacrificed their own white Western-style pants, pretending to fall on them and deliberately making things difficult for them. Of course, they did not show weakness either. They would all hold hands together to increase their combat power.</p>
<p>Some students really fell in the center of the ice skating rink, which made everyone laugh. Especially when female students fell, there was a roar of laughter. There was a little girl with two braids who was not very familiar with ice skating and often somersaulted. She always complained to the male students who laughed at her.</p>
<p>The layout of the ice skating rink is very simple, but very plain. Although the light is not very sufficient, the air is still very fresh. I heard that a coffee shop will be opened next to it in the near future. At that time, after ice skating with your lover, holding hands and going to this coffee shop to eat something is not the same as being tired from dancing in the brightly lit and intoxicating dance hall and accompanying your lover to eat something in the Dahua Restaurant.</p>

<p>The Birth of the Green Field Society</p>
<p>Jinan University students attach great importance to extracurricular activities, and there are many various academic groups. However, there is still no perfect organization for art groups. Recently, the birth of a Green Field Society has been able to gather the excellent members of the school to devote themselves to the performance of various literary and artistic activities, such as preparing for public performances and publishing publications, which has created a very strong atmosphere in the school and has almost become the only topic of discussion among students after class. The purpose of this society is to unite young people who love art and promote contemporary art, so the recruitment of members is not limited to the school. Within two weeks of joining the school, there are already more than 30 people. This also shows the great attraction of the society. The society's internal organization temporarily consists of literature, drama, and music departments. The society is scheduled to hold an establishment conference at the Lujia Garden near Jinan University at 1:00 PM this Saturday (June 7). Guests are welcome to visit and there will be various recreational activities for performance. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time. In addition, the society's publication has been named Oasis and will be published before June 15. The drama department of the society is currently preparing to rehearse Shakespeare's masterpiece Julius Caesar and plans to hold its first public performance during the third anniversary of Jinan University.</p>
<p>The Story of World Literature (167) Written by John Macy Translated by Hu Cuchi</p>

<p>Russian Literature of the Nineteenth Century</p>
<p>(War and Peace) is not merely a novel; it is a narrative poem of Russian social life, a history of the Napoleonic Wars era. Its scope is vast, encompassing many short stories. Each person stands before a grand backdrop, moving, and they are truly individual people within that grand drama. The four families who are the protagonists, each person is a character. Tolstoy possesses an unparalleled gift for character depiction. He touches upon a character and makes them come alive. Moreover, he possesses the power of depiction, a sense of the scene, whether it be a panoramic view of the battlefield or the interior of a Moscow home. His story is crowded and extremely complex because there are numerous points of intersecting interests. He instinctively follows a method that, in some places, he calls a principle: never forcing the end of the story but letting it proceed. His (naturalism) is not a theory but a manifestation of his nature, his disposition. He views things correctly and through a non-imaginary lens.</p>
<p>The only flaw of (War and Peace) is that it is too broad; that very breadth renders it amorphous. In (Anna Karenina), the scope is not as vast, and the force is more concentrated. Anna's story moves with the greatest tragic inevitability. Her character and her affairs, like a river flowing toward a waterfall, rush her directly toward her doom. The sinful woman abandons a husband who can be regarded as the complete epitome of cold righteousness for a handsome and vain lover. Thus, she finds herself cut off both from her weary lover and from the society she abandoned. She is punished not by some abstract code of good or evil but by the morality of irreconcilable facts. There is no longer any place for her in life. Thus, suicide is the only solution.</p>
<p>As a contrast to the fervent passion of Anna and her lover is the calm story of Levin and Kitty's family life. This part of the book is only loosely related to the central tragedy. However, because Levin wrestles with the mysteries of existence and sees peace in religious mysticism, it is Tolstoy himself. Tolstoy expounds and explains his own views on ethics, religion, politics, art, and so on, consuming the rest of his life. Turgenev, of whom he said, "In modern European literature, I cannot compare to anyone," believed that Tolstoy's departure from literature was an unforgivable sin. However, one of Tolstoy's unforgivable sins was indulging in mere literature. In this respect, he was a master of the past. In (What is Art?), he sweeps almost all the masterpieces we love, including his own novels, into the rubbish heap. At the age of seventy, he once returned to writing novels, writing (Resurrection). Nevertheless, his motivation was not artistic but practical, to raise money for a persecuted Christian sect, the Doukhobors. Although Tolstoy despised money, he also liked to earn it for others. The book is filled with too many moral purposes, but it also reveals the undiminished power of character depiction and scene realization. The artistic spirit within him takes this opportunity to take revenge. Tolstoy's religious belief, reached through great spiritual labor, is extremely simple, liberated from religious authority and theological sophistry. According to his interpretation, the teachings of Jesus were the Orthodox Church fearing his power, so it expelled him from the Church, and examining his books only increased his power. His religious ideas naturally led him to non-resistance and peaceful anarchism. If he had been poor and nameless, he would have been sent to prison or exiled to Siberia. However, he was a literary king more powerful than earthly kings. If the government had taken harsh measures against him, a wave of protests would have swept across Europe. Therefore, the government shifted the hand of persecution to his humble followers, causing Tolstoy endless sorrow. It was good that he died before 1914.</p>
<p>Tolstoy's major works have been translated into English and are available in inexpensive editions. The best translations are by Aylmer Maude, in several volumes including the most important works, already listed in (The World's Classics series). Maude is the author of (The Life of Tolstoy) in two volumes. In every aspect, even when he rode his beloved pony for too long, the reader finds Tolstoy interesting. His astonishing vitality makes even his most insignificant pages come alive.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Electrical Enterprises in Japan <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>By Lin Ying-mei</p>
<p>The electrical enterprise was invented in 1882. Five years later, it was introduced to Japan. At that time, in the Meiji 20th year, an electrical plant was established in Tokyo to supply the general needs. It has been over forty years since. Examining its development process, it is roughly the same as in various countries around the world. Initially, it was dedicated to supplying electric lights within the city. Later, with the invention of transformers, the power supply area expanded further than before, extending to the suburbs. Subsequently, electric motors (i.e., motors) were gradually improved, sufficient for industrial power. Thus, they were adopted one after another, and the demand increased sharply. Before long, insulators were invented and improved several times, finally achieving the realization of high-voltage, long-distance power transmission. Major load centers could thus be interconnected. Accordingly, large-scale power plants and high-voltage, long-distance power lines also arose in succession, which is what is known today as the era of super-electricity. Now, the current status of electrical enterprises in Japan is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Potential Hydropower for Electricity Generation</p>
<p>According to the survey results at the end of December of Showa 3rd year, the hydropower generation was 2,420,700 kilowatts, and the thermal power generation was 1,420,300 kilowatts, totaling 3,850,000 kilowatts. Hydropower accounted for slightly over 63%, and thermal power accounted for slightly under 37%. According to the survey by the Ministry of Communications, the potential hydropower available for electricity generation in Japan is said to be 14 million horsepower. Judging from the achievements of past development, if assisted by thermal power generation, the total amount of electricity generated can definitely be increased twofold. Due to its geographical conditions, Japan has more rainfall, so it can utilize hydropower for electricity generation. However, the amount of rainfall varies with the seasons, so the most economical method is to use both hydropower and thermal power. The current power generation capacity of thermal power plants is 1,433,000 kilowatts, but usually, only half of it is used, about 718,000 kilowatts, with the rest used to supplement hydropower.</p>
<p>Due to topographical reasons, the locations of hydropower generation in Japan are divided into two major zones: the Japanese Sea coast and the Pacific coast. Thermal power plants with a capacity of 70,000 kilowatts or more are centered around Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and other places, as the location is near the sea, which is convenient for coal transportation. In addition, there are 154,000-volt extra-high-voltage power transmission lines to connect hydropower and thermal power. Japan currently has 2,600 kilometers of 100,000-volt and higher transmission lines and interconnections, and 4,404 kilometers of 50,000-volt and higher lines. As for the highest power transmission pressure, it is currently 154,000 volts. In the future, when transmitting power over even longer distances, it will inevitably increase to 220,000 volts or more.</p>
<p>Distribution of Power Supply</p>
<p>In Showa 2nd year, the total amount of electricity supplied, excluding small power plants with less than 100 kilowatts for business, private use, and official use, was 10,558,880,000 kilowatt-hours. Among them, the Kanto area (centered on Tokyo) accounted for 3,033,000,000, the Chubu area (centered on Nagoya) accounted for 966,900,000, and the Kansai area (centered on Osaka) accounted for 2,639,600,000 kilowatt-hours. The total of the above three major load center areas was 6,639,500,000, which is 63% of the total. Calculating the national average, each person accounts for about 172 kilowatt-hours. According to regional calculations, Kansai is the largest, with each person accounting for about 284 kilowatt-hours, followed by Hokuriku at 228, and Chubu at 206, and Kanto at 200 kilowatt-hours. Further dividing the above three major areas into industrial zones with concentrated populations, the following results are obtained:</p>
<p>Electricity Consumption in Industrial Zones, Showa 2nd Year</p>
<p>|                      | Population (Millions) | Electricity Consumption (Million kWh) | Average kWh per Person |</p>
<p>| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |</p>
<p>| Tokyo Yokohama       | 2.037                | 5.478                                | 372                      |</p>
<p>| Nagoya               | 0.605                | 1.428                                | 424                      |</p>
<p>| Osaka Kobe           | 2.305                | 6.189                                | 372                      |</p>
<p>Electricity for Lighting</p>
<p>At the end of Showa 2nd year, the total number of electricity lighting users was 10,547,235, accounting for 88% of the total number of households in the country. The number of electric lamps was 32,232,991, and the electricity consumption was 736,169 kilowatts, with an average of about 3.1 lamps and 69.7 watts of electricity consumption per household. The reason for the development and prevalence of household electric lights in Japan can be attributed to the following two points: (1) the flat-rate electricity fee system, and (2) the rental system of indoor electric wires and other appliances to favor small users. Among the countries in the world, only Switzerland has a higher level of prevalence than Japan.</p>
<p>As for industrial electricity consumption, at the end of Showa 2nd year, there were 339,741 motors in terms of motive power, with a horsepower of 2,404,644 (1,793,859 kilowatts). The electricity used in the chemical industry other than motive power was 446,326 kilowatts, totaling 2,240,085 kilowatts.</p>
<p>Future Demand for Electricity</p>
<p>Household electric heating has recently become increasingly popular. At the end of Showa 1st year, there were about 106,708 users nationwide, consuming 127,340 kilowatts. In the future, with the improvement of lifestyles, the demand for electric heating will be limitless. Electricity for agricultural use has also shown signs of development in recent years. Observing the situation at the end of Showa 3rd year: in terms of motive power, there were 20,493 motors with a horsepower of 73,965 horsepower; in terms of electric heating, it was 2,857 kilowatts. The total number of lamps for pest control and other agricultural applications was 89,088, with a capacity of 1,661 kilowatts. Electric fans and others were 67 kilowatts, with a total capacity of 59,764 kilowatts. The electricity consumption of electric railways and railway electrification in Showa 1st year was 443,423,000 kilowatt-hours for electric trains (DC) and 131,871,000 kilowatt-hours for railway electrification (AC). If calculated with an annual increase of 90 million kilowatt-hours, the consumption in Showa 3rd year may reach</p>
<p>750 million to 800 million kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>Electrical Enterprise and Income/Expenditure</p>
<p>At the end of Showa 2nd year, there were a total of 728 electrical enterprises in Japan. Among them, 628 were operated by companies, and 100 were operated by public organizations. Among these 100, only about ten places such as Osaka and Tokyo were operated by prefectures and cities with larger scales. The majority were scattered in remote villages and towns with extremely small scales. It can be seen that most of the electrical enterprises in Japan are in the hands of private individuals. Among the total of 728, 15 have a capital of 50 million yuan or more, and 6 have 100 million yuan or more.</p>
<p>At the end of Showa 2nd year, the total capital was said to be 3,024,200,000 yuan, of which the paid-up capital was 2,677,200,000 yuan, the amount of debt was 888,500,000 yuan, and the loan was 617,500,000 yuan. The total fixed capital was 3,667,400,000 yuan. The total of paid-up capital, debt, and loan was 4,183,200,000 yuan, exceeding the fixed capital by 515,800,000 yuan, most of which was invested by large companies in their affiliated institutions.</p>
<p>The total revenue for the same year was over 763,560,000 yuan, which is equal to 20.8% of the fixed capital. After deducting the total expenditure of 484,020,000 yuan, there was a net profit of 279,560,000 yuan, which is about 10.5% of the paid-up capital.</p>
<p>Recently, various industries in Japan have been vigorously advocating rationalization, and the electrical enterprise cannot be unique. Therefore, it is gradually trending towards large-scale to improve efficiency and unify management. This can enhance capital utilization capacity and promote recruitment. Why not do it?</p>
