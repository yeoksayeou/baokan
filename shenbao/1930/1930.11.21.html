<p>勞大進兵失利立時停戰討議戰策努务反攻宋金海首先立功過曾望繼之比數成十二比八相差極近斯時勞大前鋒銳勢甚壯大有反敗爲勝之可能乃因投擲不準故仍届服於江灣勢下上半時以十二比十九落後</p>

<p>大條今晨或續升</p>
<p>升降力轉弱昨二十日標金狀况稍有榮辱惟無激烈之變動始終僅計二兩六七錢廻顧終則微跌人心恍惚時有一二兩盤旋各號交易不湧若福昌·元亨·元永興等皆有納進然信亨·恒興·生人等有所脫售至海外銀市微升不爲所動早市和平在八十四兩有零殆外匯已回長半檔即見一挫但明暗異趣銀行初吸後出並聞中美鉅額借欵未成之說市塲得此消息同業心理爲之一振而源成·元興永·元茂永等均有爭購遂趨高　驟然漲爲八十六兩復因套頭等傾向賫出匯票亦平重鑡萎靡之狀迨後市更無大量買賫惟在連帮及志豐永等稍進元成永元茂永及散户等則有賫出殆價甚平最後計爲八十四兩左右今晨大條或稍續升云云</p>
<p>條銀果回長自早問正月份標金開盤爲五百八十四兩二錢（毛盤進退於八十四兩内外交易鮮少）大條近期長十六分之一上日之預測今果騐矣遠期不更銀價則升八分之一嗣後略加數錢爲四兩六七錢繼因信亨委托晋安售出故已降去二兩餘僅爲八十二兩三錢而外滙尚平十二月英金以一七三一二五出入可做惟風聞匯豐掛牌或有放長之望以致市况向下也</p>
<p>標金竟站住俄而買方活動殆先令揭價果長一二五美金加二五東滙跌七五金價並不再跌尚能站住時爲三兩三四錢實因福昌等買進良由朝鮮吃去現大連一兩二錢六分八七五反爲再行提增一兩九點三刻爲八十四兩二三錢至十點零退爲三兩八九錢復又回上兩許此乃盤頭而已旋由元亨·元茂永·源成·元興永等紛紛拖進尤以聞中美借債不成之消息引起一般人向榮之態因銀價不致提漲也迨十點三刻竟逹八十六兩</p>

<p>— 小魯</p>
<p>的確大學生比什麽都大他們的學問·費用·以至於喫東西無一不大何以見得我們可以在大學門前的喫店爲證據</p>
<p>差不多各大學都有消費社社裹自然多半是賣喫的東西但是還不夠喫還要外面喫店接濟他們喫東西也可分季的大槪冬熱夏冷春秋兩季是没有標準菓子是四時適宜的</p>
<p>論喫物的價錢不必說是貴的中等包飯每月要十一元半（只吃兩餐）山梨橘子一隻賣一角多平均每人每天要吃六次第一次是早餐第二次是十時那時候的點心第三次是午餐第四次是四時的點心第五次是晚餐第六次是晚上十時的點心還有午晚餐後的水菓和星期六或日的大菜不計</p>
<p>這様來自然費用大增没有錢的時候眞是太難過了如果不喫又過不去喫又没錢於是他們想記帳的妙法來投機的小販也非常歡迎因爲記帳可以增加生意一到了季終每人至少也要付帳錢二三十元</p>
<p>還有幾個聰明的想了一（揩油妙法這揩油不是揩同學的油是揩喫店的油校外喫店的油也難揩最容易揩的是消費社的油因爲消費社是學生會辦的這油怎様揩法大半是記帳不還錢或且還了一半到了明年學生會改組社長換了舊帳也忘了油就揩了</p>
<p>Ｃ大學的消費社爲着揩油的人太多想了一個妙法是（限定某日至某日是收帳不還的請訓育部代收）訓育部是用以訓育學生的學生做這没人格的事自然也想訓訓他</p>
<p>還有幾位更聰明的他們想記帳不穩也會來討不知喫了連帳都不記白白地揩油最近Ｃ大學的消費社裹貼了一個條子這條子寫的是</p>
<p>（某君你常常於上午九時駕臨敝社白喫本當宣佈大名因情面有關暫且保守秘密此後尚望愼重）</p>

<h3 id="c213">海上冒險的美國海童子軍 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>據美國國家海童子軍理事岐因氏報告青年們現在又傾向於海上的冒險和浪漫在今年的夏天有五日隻海童子軍駕駛的船往來於合衆國海岸及内地各河道去年全美的海上童子軍和他們的領袖人數已經增加到九千八百人了</p>
<p>童子軍運動中的海童子軍訓練是給年長的孩子們一種公民和德育上訓練的機會另外給每一個海童子軍得到航海時候的浪漫和冒險的樂趣眼前美國四十三州阿拉斯加菲列濱夏威夷及阿眞廷幾個地方共有六百個海童子軍團體墨西哥和古巴的童子軍和美國的童子軍向不連絡的也有海童子軍的組織了他們的成績都很不差</p>
<p>已往的幾年中許多孩子因爲海童子軍運動而得到冒險的機會否則這種機會是不容易得到的去年支加哥海童子軍團駕駛一艘小的（藍月）帆船獲得麥開納克船賽錦標這是全世界最長而最難的淡水航比賽海童子軍保羅雪潑爾因爲他具有充份的童子軍訓練得到一個機會和擺爾特上將同時北極探險又有奥斯丁地方的海童子軍大衛馬丁他同馮盧克納候爵在西班牙洋面上探險</p>
<p>自從一九二七年支加哥海童子軍駕駛約翰鮑登菲博物院的遠征船（北光）號大舉往北極探險帶回支加哥許多博物標本及科學上的考據海童子軍從此努力於冒險不過像這様幾個海童子軍的冒險事業並不足以代表海童子軍的全部精神海童子軍訓練的價値照事實上講在完善指導之下給每一個海童子軍有冒險的機會並且因他個人的航海興趣從完善的指首導中學習航海術和有關國家歷史的海上變遷</p>
<p>全美六百個海童子軍團體裹自已備有航船的佔百分之九十這種航船從十五尺的小艇艇一直到長一百五十尺的帆船止美國各地童子軍會及各個海童子軍團體都置備這様的船</p>
<p>美國童子軍的海童子軍部裹他們所有的船中間有不少具有歷史上的興趣最近華盛頓海童子軍所得到的一隻老（阿哥）快艇七十九尺長載重卅八噸是從前合衆國海童學校的一艘教練船加利福尼亞州聖底各的海童子軍他們佔有老（印度明星）的三桅船這隻船曾在阿拉斯加運糧艦隊裹得過榮譽講到時間的久暫那末支加哥童子軍總部的訓練船（拿各蜜士）要算海童子軍船中最老的了所有合衆國第一批的海童子軍領袖就是在這隻船上所訓練的紐約城海童子軍他們有一隻長一百六十九尺的帆船名呌（米那士公主）現在給人家作賽船之用</p>
<p>兩處地方區的海童子軍都備有訓練用的帆船一處是紐約和紐裘賽還有一處爲伊利諾土印第亞納米西根及惠士康生今年夏天紐約和紐裘賽的海童子軍駕駛長五十五尺的（才亞石惠德（號帆船巡行海上第七區的海童子軍駕一隻長一百零三尺的帆船名呌（濱答）這兩條船在海中航行七天由有經騐的領袖指導一切使孩子們學習航海的初步及駕船的方法</p>
<p>許多的海童子軍他們自已造成口碑和軼聞不論駕駛小艇大船對於地方國家常有一種眞誠的服務精神自從添設海童子軍份部以來其中服務精神最顯著的要算蕯拉沙泰（南十字）船上的海童子軍了他們在往年福羅立逹遇難時做了不少可貴的工作</p>
<p>特連頓地方海童子軍新近很榮幸的得到羅勃林家屬損贈一隻摩托快艇這船名呌（白倫脫雷）長六十五尺具有逹塞爾式引擎在海童子軍艦隊裹十分出色米西根省克勒門方地方海童子軍他們有一隻潛水艇驅逐艦所改造的船船身長一百十尺惠士康生的米耳華基海童子軍有一隻長八十尺的帆船名呌（甲必丹老倫士）</p>
<p>美國中西區的海童子軍發展非常迅速好像米蘇里甘蕯士衣阿華科羅拉多内布拉斯加及俄明等各地對於水上活動不常提及的現在也有二十五團海童子軍人數在三百五十左右他們的活動多在本鄉的河湖方面有幾處地方河道過小他們便用獨木舟來代替船艇這區域的海童子軍爲得到航海上必要的知識起見他們有時候駕着小船舫行到支加哥及大湖地方</p>
<p>今年中已有兩團海童子軍參加（羅勃脫太子）比賽全程五百七十英里各種大小式様的船隻多可加入航程從華盛頓西雅圖出發直馳到加拿大羅勃脫太子島兩團海童子軍參加這個比賽一團是華盛頓西雅圖的梯衣童子軍另外一團是華盛頓太哥麥地方的海童子軍這次比賽中沿太平洋岸有許多老　的</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>航海家參加其間結果太哥麥的海童子軍得佔優勝之一他們航海的小心獲得首獎本季開始之時支加哥海童子軍團初高兩級團員與大湖海軍訓練站的兩級學員比賽小艇航行這個比賽在波濤洶湧的海中舉行航程大約長一英里結果高級童子軍的錦標被高級海員奪去可是初級童子軍却打敗了初級海員哩</p>
<p>美國海童子軍今年航行到許多地方舊金山海童子軍航行於蕯克剌門托河之間省海童子軍駛舟至紐約有幾個孩子還是初次到這個大城市哩特連頓海童子軍坐了他們的新船到班哥去給予團員不少的冒險機會華盛頓海童子軍取道折蕯比克海　到諾福克還有幾個童子軍在夏季裹航海往各地旅行</p>
<p>今年支加哥海童子軍仍舊參加麥開納克島比賽這是美國淡水河比賽中最長又最困難的一條路去年的錦標給一團海童子軍奪去雖然他們的船身非常之小得到勝利的機會也十分的少據國家海童子軍理事岐因氏所報告去年海子軍獲得麥開納克島比賽那一段故事在童子軍運動發展歷史中是很有趣味的</p>
<p>一千九百二十年美國　有海童子軍的組織那時岐因氏充當（拿各密土）船上的海童子軍指導這是一隻舊船爲新創的支加哥海童子軍所獲得的岐因氏說（那時候這條舊船上有十八個小孩子他們對於駕船一些也不懂得拿各密土船啓椗的時候我有幾個朋友駕駛着遊艇俱樂部的精緻小帆船他們笑我們教孩子學習航海和實行海童子軍訓練）</p>
<p>（駕駛船舶是件好笑的事又是無可奈何的那時候是七年以前國内的海童子軍很少去年麥開納克比賽舉行時合衆國内海童子軍和領袖等人數逹七千五百名所有的船隻在四百艘左右每條船上都有有經騐的船員知道怎様駕駛船舶支加哥海童子軍進步非常神速成立的新團體中有許多爲游艇俱樂部所帮忙的這些人就是前從非笑海童子軍的（藍月）船上那時候祇有五個海童子軍</p>
<p>（舉行麥開納克比賽的前一年這些童子軍開始預備一切他們必需苦心計劃因爲參予這個比賽的有許多中西區的老練水手海童子軍很細心的研究已往的比賽成績他們算出每一種風向的路程以免比賽那天臨時失措這些童子軍不知不覺間發現以前幾次比賽時的風多是東南向的而且這風總在比賽終程時方始吹動）</p>
<p>（比賽的日子到了一團服裝整齊的海童子軍在（藍月）船上隨衆出發這次加入比賽的船一共有四十隻海童子軍隨了他們的領袖加入還是破題兒第一遭哩到了比賽的最後一天大家都向斯啓勒加里島進行這個島往常作爲行程中轉灣的標記而比賽得勝的又常在這個地方佔先進行海童子軍在這里却是落後一些但是他們預先計算好那風突然間從東南方吹來了别隻船上的水手都暫停另定進行方針航海的老手們都拿出氣囊三角帆大三角蓬及漁人中檣帆等張起來很快活底上前去</p>
<p>（突然間大家都很驚奇有一隻船飛向前去爲從來比賽中所没有的這隻就是海童子軍所乘的船孩子們早已定了一條航海妙計哩他們的船上也帶有氣囊三角帆大三角蓬和漁人中檣帆懸在前後桅之間因了他們自定的航行方式代表美國童子軍海童子軍部的（藍月）船海童子軍就奪了這次的錦標）岐因氏說（倘然你還要多曉得一些那末支加哥的游艇俱樂部會員也許他們會告訴你關於一藍月）奪標的經過和現在他們自已所主持的海童子軍團體）</p>

<h3 id="e2">America's New Tariff and Russia's New Economic Policy <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Since the United States announced its new tariff with increased tax rates and Soviet Russia announced its five-year New Economic Policy with the sale of goods at low prices, European countries have regarded them as the only major issues and have expressed a unified resistance. The increased tax rates will inevitably lead to sluggish sales of goods imported by various countries due to increased prices, and the low-price sales will inevitably lead to domestic goods in various countries being suppressed by incoming goods and losing their competitiveness. Therefore, both have a great impact on the commerce of various countries, especially at a time when the economy is in decline and purchasing power is exhausted, it is even easier to feel the pain. European countries are struggling to maintain their own commerce, and adding such a major blow is why slogans such as customs unions and economic alliances are being advocated more and more. In fact, the impact of heavy taxes and low-price sales is not limited to European countries, and China has also suffered losses. At present, in the Chinese business community, damage from American heavy taxes on products such as eggs, cowhide, and lace has already been reported, and diplomatic authorities have been requested to negotiate. However, it is not known what measures will be taken in response to Soviet Russia's low-priced goods. According to recent news from the Northeast, in order to implement the new economic policy, Soviet Russia has organized a national goods trade group and has established branch offices in Harbin and Shenyang. The Japanese are afraid of being deprived of their business and have begun to pay attention. China, as the owner, is even more concerned about its interests and should not turn a blind eye to it.</p>

<p>Zhuang Zhihuan Circulates a Telegram to Various Telegraph Bureaus Explaining the Situation: Nanjing: The international telecommunications negotiations have not been resolved for a long time. According to information from the Ministry of Communications, the content of the plan fully complies with the Party's program and the National Government's policy to safeguard the independence of national sovereignty and maintain the freedom of international telecommunications. China's international telecommunications have been restricted by the old submarine cable agreement for 50 years, resulting in significant losses in sovereignty and economy. Now that the old contract has expired, it is truly a unique opportunity to abolish the old agreement and recover our rights. However, the other party cannot give up all rights. After several meetings, we have refuted their arguments based on reason, and some progress has been made, but a satisfactory result has not yet been achieved. However, we must adhere to our predetermined position and never make any concessions. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>Beiping: Taiyuan News: Yan Xishan summoned all the generals to Wutai on the 18th to discuss the distribution of military power and military salaries after he leaves, but no concrete plan was reached. Because the three factions of Jinbei, Jinnan, and Baoding do not agree with each other, Yan is suspicious of those with ability and qualifications, and those he considers his confidants are mostly incompetent. Yan trusts his nephew Yang Aiyuan the most, so he appointed him as the Deputy Commander of the Jin-Sui Garrison to secretly control the power over Xu Yongchang and Shang Zhen. Only Xu Yongchang is focused on the reorganization of the Jin banknotes and dares not ask about the military's aftermath. Communist leaflets have been discovered in Taiyuan in recent days, so precautions have been tightened, and traffic is cut off after 10 PM. Feng Yuxiang's whereabouts are becoming increasingly elusive, with rumors of him being at both the Tianlongshan and Jian'an Village. It is already a fact that Feng is not at the Jin Ancestral Hall.

<p>Limiting Speaking Time</p>
<p>Discussion Nearing Conclusion</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The Indian Round Table Conference resumed today to discuss all issues. Prime Minister MacDonald, at the beginning of the meeting, asked those who wished to speak to register their names so that the discussion could be concluded tomorrow. He also stated that the committee should be established quickly and not be delayed further. After five people spoke today, MacDonald raised the issue of speaking time and the number of speakers, saying that if there were no restrictions, it would become the habit of the House of Commons to engage in day and night debates. The attendees subsequently resolved to limit speeches to ten minutes, with the possibility of extending the time at the discretion of the chairman in special circumstances.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - The Indian Round Table Conference's plenary session resumed today. Maharaja of Bashaala spoke, stating the relationship between India and Britain, saying that if India were an equal member in the British Empire, there would certainly be unprecedented freedom and human rights between East and West. He believed that the fastest way to create India's noble status and honor was through a federal system. Only in this way could the Indian princely states join with British India to achieve the work of a great India. The Indian princes were not afraid of future changes. Some spoke of the possibility of the tide of democracy sweeping away the princely states, but he did not believe that to be the case. Hindu representative Dr. Munje said that the time when strength could intimidate the Indian people was now over. Although Britain had made contributions to India, Britain treated India like a farmer treats a cow, for its milk. India now wanted to be one of the self-governing regions in the British Empire. Sikh representative of India, Ujjal Singh, said that if the Indian delegates could not agree on a method to resolve India's political system that could satisfy the wishes of the Indian people, they would not dare to return to India. He believed that if India was an equal member of the British Empire with a responsible central government, then a solution could be found. He knew that the defense issue was difficult, but this matter and diplomacy could be temporarily entrusted to the Viceroy of India, supplemented by an advisory committee composed of Indians. British Indian representative Patro also said that the central government should have full responsibility. Any decision made by the conference must satisfy all parties. The agricultural community hoped that constitutional changes could improve the lives of farmers and small business owners. The attendees must hold this view and not focus solely on the intellectual community. Muhammad Ali, leader of the All-India Muslim League, spoke at length, saying that the meaning expressed by Lord Peel yesterday was like a dead branch that should be pruned. The British Emperor knew the Indian people better than any cabinet member. He hoped that he would be fair to the 320 million people, who accounted for one-fifth of the world's population. He wished to write in future history: "George III lost America, George V gained India." He also said that if Indian representatives returned to their country without creating a new self-governing region, they would return to a self-governing region that would no longer belong to Britain.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Hurricane on Hawaiian Island Creates Terrible Disaster <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Water pipes burst, turning level ground into a swamp</p>
<p>Heavy rain for day and night, ruined houses and collapsed walls everywhere</p>
<p>Associated Press, Honolulu, 19th - The hurricane here has caused a terrible disaster, the severity of which has never been seen in the recorded history of the Hawaiian Islands. Initially, the hurricane burst water pipes in the mountains above Honolulu, causing the stored water to overflow and flood residential and commercial areas, covering a distance of five miles. The loss of life and property is incalculable. According to reports this morning, it is confirmed that nine people have died, and thirty others are still missing. Hundreds of houses in the Kalihi area have been washed away, and hundreds of pigs have also been blown away without a trace. Five employees at the naval station were simultaneously submerged. Fernant, an employee of the Honolulu Advertiser, drowned in his car due to the water surge. There are many similar incidents. At the same time, heavy rain continued for 24 hours, with the water level on level ground reaching two feet and seventy-four inches. Residents are traveling on small boats on the streets. Electrical traffic is completely cut off. Most of the Wahlau Railroad has been washed away, with fallen machines and boulders everywhere. It is roughly estimated that the loss will be between 100,000 and 200,000 gold dollars. The hurricane subsided only after sunrise today, with ruined houses and collapsed walls everywhere. The residents who have lost their homes, either dozens or hundreds, are left facing each other, which is pitiful. Preparations are now underway for relief efforts, and rescue teams excavating the bodies of the dead are also working hard.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Oklahoma City, 19th - Severe winds wreaked havoc early this morning, reportedly killing 22 and injuring over 100.

<h3 id="e62">Japan's Assimilation Policy in Taiwan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Deliberation</p>
<p>Making Island People Forget Their Motherland</p>
<p>···New York Sun Correspondent···</p>
<p>Translated by World News Agency, the New York Sun published a correspondence from Miss Schnau of Taiwan stating that Taiwanese people are Chinese, which is self-evident, but in thirty years it may not be so. The Japanese are working hard to assimilate the Chinese people of Taiwan as quickly as possible. In the thirty-five years since Japan annexed Taiwan, the results of its efforts have gradually become apparent. Through schools, temples, newspapers, and other forms of contact, the 300,000 Japanese in Taiwan have had a remarkable influence on the 4 million Chinese. In Japanese official documents and all languages, they never mention "Chinese people" (支那人) but only refer to them as "Islanders" (本島人). This clearly has a purpose, which is to make the Chinese forget that they are Chinese and prevent them from reminiscing about their motherland and engaging in rebellions and revolutions in the future. Since occupying Taiwan, the Japanese have made every effort to prevent patriotic people or revolutionary parties from China from residing in Taiwan to avoid inciting the Taiwanese people. On the one hand, they prevent the Taiwanese people from being infected with the spirit of Chinese nationalism, not allowing the Kuomintang to establish branches and not allowing the Three Principles of the People to be promoted. Regarding the religious beliefs of the Chinese people, the Japanese are also working hard on assimilation. They have set up many temples of the Japanese state religion throughout Taiwan, and their Buddhist temples retain Japanese-style sectarian names. In addition, they spare no expense to build several shrines to worship Japanese gods or heroes. However, according to the reporter's observation, there are only three or four Chinese people visiting each temple.</p>
<p>The Japanese pay great attention to education, and the assimilation policy in this area is progressing the most. There is no difficulty for Chinese children to obtain higher education, but there is one condition: they must voluntarily forget that they are Chinese. Except for a few elementary schools, other schools generally follow the Japanese school system and teach in Japanese.</p>
<p>The total population of Taiwan is approximately 4.25 million (including 84,000 aborigines). There are currently 132 junior schools, 720 public elementary schools, 20 middle schools, 4 vocational schools, 3 normal schools, and several commercial, agricultural, and forestry schools. According to recent statistics, the percentage of Japanese children enrolled in school is 97.63, while the percentage of Taiwanese children (Chinese) is 32.34. Any traveler arriving in Taiwan from China who happens to be present when schools dismiss sees a group of Chinese elementary school students marching out of Japanese-style schools in an orderly fashion, carrying schoolbags and water bottles like little soldiers. The girls wear blue and white uniforms with black shoes and socks, while the boys wear military caps and short uniforms with brass buttons. Few would suspect that these orderly, well-trained children are of the same blood as the children on the mainland across the strait.</p>
<p>The daily life of the islanders is modeled on the Japanese in every respect. Everywhere you can see Chinese people bowing and scraping when they meet on the street, even to the point of being solemn and holding their breath to imitate the Japanese with uncanny accuracy. Those who see this often find the Chinese on the mainland funny and quick to laugh, but not the Japanese. Why are the Taiwanese people not like their compatriots in their motherland? If anyone doubts that such assimilation methods of education, religion, and intermarriage are insufficient to transform the world's most cohesive Chinese into Japanese, try visiting the graves of the Taiwanese people, and you will know that the oldest and most sacred customs of the Chinese have been broken. The graves of the Chinese are all raised high above the ground, while the Japanese are buried underground, with only a stone tablet marking the spot. In recent years, Taiwanese burials have mostly been changed to follow the Japanese style. A patch of weeds, with nothing but a stone tablet, who would know that those who sleep here are Chinese? How thorough is the Japanese assimilation work!</p>
<p>Dentsu, Wushe, 20th - The Anda Brigade used curved-trajectory artillery fire to bombard the Mashehuo cave yesterday at 10 a.m., and then had the aborigines assisting in the battle shout, thereby occupying the Mashehuo cave. The enemy aborigines abandoned a dozen corpses and fled into the deep mountains again. The expeditionary force will conduct a risky search and suppression again starting today.</p>

<p>Motion to Ban Tear Gas</p>
<p>The UK, US, and Other Countries Express Opposition</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 19th - Today, the Disarmament Preparatory Committee decided to revise the numerical regulations for combat ships and heavy artillery power in the naval agreement draft into an algebraic formula to allow for flexibility. British representative Cecil also requested the reduction and restriction of submarines, including those of small naval nations, because he received instructions from his government recognizing submarines as a major offensive weapon.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 19th - Today, during the Disarmament Preparatory Committee's discussion of poison gas, someone proposed that while poison gas has been banned, tear gas should still be allowed. Many countries, including the UK and US, vehemently opposed this, claiming that tear gas is used by the police to subdue rioters and prisoners and should not be banned. The German representative strongly supported the ban, saying that since tear gas can be openly manufactured, it is impossible to secretly manufacture other types of poison gas. Therefore, if this ban is not established, the convention banning poison gas is no different from waste paper.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th - China's plan to borrow silver bars worth 360 million yuan from the U.S. government seems likely to be disappointed. Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Sino-American Commercial Treaties announced today that he has not yet received the recommendation of Lin Baerge, legal counsel to the Chinese government. According to Lin, he arrived in San Francisco on October 30th, reportedly on a special mission from Chairman Chiang to negotiate a loan of one billion silver ounces. Pittman gave an informal speech saying that the crux of the silver problem lies in oversupply, not in overproduction. He is unwilling to support any action that cannot remedy this problem. The U.S. lending silver to China alone cannot stop the decline in silver prices, as it is difficult to guarantee that countries competing with the U.S. in trade with China will not sell their silver reserves on the world market at a reduced price. If that were to happen, the silver market would be even more unsustainable. Pittman suggested that lending silver to China could solve the problem, but it must be lent jointly by countries that have significant commercial relations with China, and not solely by one country.</p>

<p>Little Entente Issues Warning Declaration</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 19th - Tomorrow is the coming-of-age day for Archduke Otto, the eldest son of the former Emperor Karl of Austria-Hungary. A celebration will be held at Stonkzy尔堡 near here. All descendants of the Habsburg and Bourbon-Parma royal families and veterans of the former Austro-Hungarian court will attend the banquet. In the afternoon, a private audience will be held where family members, former officials, colleagues, and friends will swear allegiance to the young lord. However, this move has no political meaning. The Belgian government has warned the abdicated King Zita against carrying out a coup in Hungary. The Little Entente has also issued a declaration stating that if Archduke Otto appears in Budapest or within the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, the countries will immediately issue a general mobilization order. The Hungarian government is also unwilling to take diplomatic and peaceful risks at this time. Therefore, the general plan by royalists to restore the monarchy in Hungary has been temporarily shelved.</p>

<p>To the Editors of All Newspapers: Please examine the following two points of error in the Central Executive Committee's Fourth Plenary Session resolution, published in various newspapers on the 18th, on refreshing the Central political system, improving the system, rectifying discipline, and establishing a central administrative focus in the shortest possible time to improve administrative efficiency: (1) In item B, regarding the plan to rectify discipline and refresh politics, the first clause, "to be discussed by the Judicial Yuan regarding the scope," the word "by" is missing, and the words "Executive Yuan" should be added. (2) In item 内, regarding the central administrative focus and local administrative guidelines in the shortest possible time, the seventh clause, regarding the military post-disaster reconstruction guidelines, there are many errors in the wording of the second item regarding the cost of military post-disaster reconstruction. The full text should be corrected as follows: (2) The expenses for military post-disaster reconstruction should be raised separately as a special fund and should not interfere with the usual administrative and military budget. However, within this one-year period, the construction of other active aspects should be prioritized and should not be carried out simultaneously. If various departments need to issue public bonds for construction projects, they should submit them to the Political Council for review. Approval can only be granted if it is guaranteed that they are truly necessary, urgent, and do not affect the credit of public bonds or increase the burden on the national treasury, and the Ministry of Finance should issue them uniformly. Please correct this as soon as possible. Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Recent Political News from the Northeast <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Issuance of Silver Dollar Exchange Notes</p>
<p>Decision to Expand Artillery by Three Regiments</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Northeast Political Affairs Committee recently received a telegram from the Central Government ordering an investigation into the following items. The committee immediately forwarded the order to various provinces on the 14th to investigate and report so that it could be compiled and reported to the Central Government. The investigation items are: (1) The vastness and area of the three northeastern provinces and the boundaries bordering Japan and Russia. (2) The total number of mountains, rivers, and waterways in the province. (3) The total number of acres of land owned by the public and private people in the province. (4) The revenue from land taxation and miscellaneous taxes in the province. (5) The finances of the province's military salaries, administrative expenses, public and private budgets, and final accounts. (6) The exact number of people in the province, as well as the nationalities and occupations of foreigners residing in the province. (7) The names of the counties in the province and the distribution of their jurisdictions. (8) The total number of schools in the province and the number of students. (9) The police administration and the number of police officers in the province.</p>
<p>The Liaoning Provincial Government, realizing that the province's finances were extremely tight and the market was sluggish, and understanding that this was due to the insufficient amount of currency in circulation, believed that it was necessary to issue silver dollar exchange notes to change the situation. It ordered the Three Eastern Provinces Official Bank to quickly find a solution. The bank then replied that it would temporarily issue 10 million yuan of silver dollar notes, fully redeemable, and then lend them to the market to facilitate circulation. The provincial government approved this and reported it to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for record. Currently, the Official Bank believes that the market situation is becoming increasingly tight, and as the new grain comes to market, there is an even greater sense that the existing banknotes are insufficient for circulation, resulting in a lack of development in trade. Therefore, in accordance with the previously determined method, it has prepared a fund of 10 million yuan and is now raising 5 million yuan as a 100% reserve to issue 5 million yuan of banknotes to relieve the market.</p>
<p>The newly appointed artillery commander, Jin Jingqing, believes that the existing artillery in the Northeast is insufficient for distribution. It is now proposed to expand it by three regiments. Liu Fusheng has been appointed as the commander of the First Regiment, Zhang Sigong as the commander of the Second Regiment, and Zhu Lihan as the commander of the Third Regiment. It is expected that the formation will be completed next month. The junior officers will be filled by graduates of the Artillery Research Class of the Military Academy. After the formation is completed, the First and Second Regiments will be stationed in Jilin and Heilongjiang, respectively, while the Third Regiment will be stationed in the Pingjin area.</p>
<p>For the convenience of command, the military authorities have specially compiled all armored vehicles into a large team, with one commander and one deputy commander each, for a total of four trains. Each train has one squad leader, four platoon leaders, and 360 soldiers, carrying 16 armored vehicles. Each train also has five sections in charge of engineering, communications, design, transportation, etc. Currently, the First Armored Train is on the PingSui Railway, the Second Armored Train is on the PingHan Railway, and the defense areas of the Third and Fourth Armored Trains are unknown. After the Northeast Army entered the customs, many personnel from the various halls and offices of the Border Defense Commissioner's Office were transferred, resulting in a large number of vacancies in the various offices of the Border Defense Commissioner's Office, which has caused a sense of uneven workload. The various directors have requested instructions from Rong Zhen, the military director. It has now been stipulated that temporary transfers will be allowed, such as when Office A is busy and the officers are insufficient, personnel from Office B will be temporarily transferred, and when Office C is busy, personnel from Office D will be temporarily transferred. It has been decided that the vacant officer positions will remain vacant and not be filled because the reorganization of the Border Defense Commissioner's Office is imminent (15th).</p>
<h3 id="e75">Jiangxi Province's Ji'an and Xiajiang Have Been Recovered <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Chongren Has Also Been Recovered</p>
<p>Relief Association Prepares Relief for Disaster Areas</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since Lu Diping arrived in Zhangshu on the 13th, he ordered the First and Second Columns, with Xu Kexiang's division in charge of the frontal attack on Xiajiang along the Gan River. Zhang Huizan's division's Dai Wang Zhu three brigades and Tan Daoyuan's Luo brigade were to pursue the bandits from the east bank of the Gan River, Xingan Chongren. Deng Ying's division [blank space in original text] was also in charge of bandit suppression in Fuzhou. Furthermore, he ordered the Third Column, Luo Lin's division, to attack Ji'an from Fenyi around Anfu, and Gong Bingfan's division from Xinyu Xiajiang to attack the east of Ji'an. The two sides launched a pincer attack. Gong's division and Wang's brigade entered Renhexu, Xiajiang on the 16th, and the division headquarters entered Jiebu on the evening of the 16th. There were only a little over a thousand communist bandits in Xia County, so on the 17th at noon, they captured Xiajiang County and continued to advance towards Ji'an. On the 18th, they joined Luo's division and occupied Ji'an County at 4 p.m. Huang Gonglue and Liu Zuoshu's bandit troops, numbering over 10,000 with approximately 2,000-3,000 rifles, were routed towards Yongxin Xingguo, extremely embarrassed. The provincial government received a telephone call from the Ninth Route Army Headquarters' forward command post in Zhangshu this afternoon (18th) reporting: (1) Xiajiang has been recovered, and the communist bandits on the east and west banks of the Gan River have been routed. Many have been captured by the government army. (2) Ji'an County has been occupied, and the various bandit factions of Huang and Liu have fled, suffering countless casualties and injuries. They are currently being pursued. The provincial government received Ji'an as an important town in western Jiangxi, which was captured by communist bandits on October 4th. They have been burning, killing, looting, and pillaging for a month and a half. Approximately thousands of people have died, and approximately hundreds of houses have been destroyed. The essence of the entire county has been lost. This is truly an unprecedented disaster.</p>
<p>As for the Zhu Mao factions, after Zhang and Tan's divisions resisted and pursued them in Fuzhou, they detoured east towards Fujian. Most of them are currently in the Shicheng Nancheng Ningdu area, only a hundred miles or so from the Fujian border. After Zhang's division recaptured Chongren, the Wang, Dai, and Zhu three brigades all reached Chongcheng and are currently joining Deng's division to pursue towards Yihuang Jianchang. Mao Bingwen's division is also marching towards Fuzhou from the province and should arrive in Fuzhou tomorrow or the day after. In the future, the suppression of the communist bandits on the Shicheng Fujian border will be based in Fuzhou. Therefore, Deng Ying has recently been ordered to rush to build an airfield in Fuzhou, to be completed within three days, so that the aviation team can fly from Fuzhou to the Fujian border to bomb the bandits.</p>
<p>The Fang Zhimin faction in northeastern Jiangxi retreated from northern Jiangxi and occupied Fuliang and Dexing, then moved towards Leping Yiyang. The 55th Division's Ruan Zhaochang's troops have arrived in Fuliang from Wuyuan, Anhui. The 5th Division's Hu Zuyu's brigade has also arrived in Duchang Raoxun from Pengze. After deployment, they will launch a large-scale pincer attack in the hope of wiping them out in one fell swoop. The Provincial Relief Association, considering that more than 60 of the 81 counties in the province have been ravaged by bandits, suffering massacres, the destruction of houses, the loss of homes, and displacement, and that the weather is gradually turning cold and winter is approaching, believes that if relief is not organized quickly, there will be no survivors left. Therefore, it has compiled a statistical report on the bandit disaster situation in the 42 counties, including Yiyang Shanggao, for which investigations have been completed, and has submitted it to the Central Government for overall relief to provide assistance (November 18).</p>
<h3 id="e76">He Jian Reports Hunan Province's Military Expenses Difficulties <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Education Funds, etc., Have All Been Diverted</p>
<p>Currently, More Than Three Million Yuan is Still Owed</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province's military expenses have always relied on Hunan Province's national tax revenue. Usually, the national tax revenue is around one million yuan per month. The military expenditure, excluding temporary expenses, requires a monthly expenditure of one million three hundred to forty thousand yuan. Therefore, previous arrears were often temporarily covered by the provincial treasury to maintain it. According to Finance Director Zhang Kailian's report, from July to the end of October, a further 1,175,795 yuan was advanced from the field tax and unified tax items for military expenses. More than three million yuan advanced before July has not yet been allocated by the central government, causing the provincial treasury to be in a very difficult situation due to the impact of the advances. Recently, due to the spread of banditry, the revenue from national and local taxes has greatly decreased. It is estimated that the national tax revenue in June was only 540,027 yuan and 3 jiao. In July, it was 390,806 yuan and 9 jiao and 4 fen. In August, it was 668,526 yuan and 8 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>Domestic News</p>
<p>In September, it was 384,794 yuan. In October, it was 740,450 yuan. In total, the five months of June, July, August, September and October collected more than 2,726,850 yuan. A total of 2,526,446 yuan and 2 jiao and 2 fen were paid for military expenses. According to the monthly military expenditure of 1,340,000 yuan, plus temporary expenses, the total for five months is more than 7 million yuan. Now, only more than 2.5 million yuan has been paid, leaving a shortfall of more than 5 million yuan. At that time, military needs were urgent and there was no way to raise funds. In addition to withdrawing more than 1.17 million yuan from the provincial tax items, the education fund, disaster relief funds, and special commercial loans totaling 1.4 million yuan were completely borrowed. However, the balance between revenue and expenditure still leaves a shortfall of more than 3 million yuan, resulting in the failure to pay more than 600,000 yuan in military expenses in June and the full amount of military salaries in July, August, September, and October. In addition, the provincial treasury's revenue has been greatly reduced due to the unrest caused by bandits. It is estimated that only 60% of the administrative expenses were paid in June, none in July, and only food expenses were maintained in August, September, and October. According to the Finance Department's announcement, a total of 1,649,078 yuan in administrative expenses were owed for June, July, August, September, and October. It is difficult to take care of oneself, let alone have the energy to subsidize military expenses. Therefore, Hunan's finances have reached the point of exhaustion. Wang Jiading, the director of the Finance Department of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, resigned because he could not find a solution. The directors of the Finance Departments of the 15th, 16th, 19th, and 31st Divisions and the Independent 7th Brigade jointly visited Zhang Kailian, the Director of Finance, yesterday to request a solution. However, in reality, the provincial treasury had no way to help. He Jian was very anxious about this situation. In addition to sending another telegram to the Central Government requesting to resign from his concurrent positions as Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, Commander of the Hunan Pacification Command, and member of the Hunan Provincial Party Department, he also submitted a memorial to General Commander Chiang requesting assistance in the difficult situation of military expenses in Hunan Province. The memorial is as follows: (Your subordinate has been fighting against the rebels and bandits for two years. The military expenses required have always been taken from the national tax revenue of Hunan Province, which is usually not enough. However, since the two invasions of the Gui rebels and the Communist bandits, the tax revenue in various places has become even more depleted. In the past, counties in western Hunan could be expected to remit taxes monthly to supplement the revenue. Recently, He Kuang fled south, and Nanhua and Jin Feng were also ravaged. There is no time for pacification, so I dare not count on urging the collection of taxes. According to my subordinate's calculation, the current number of troops is about 80,000, and the monthly salary requirement is more than 1.4 million yuan. In addition, the various temporary expenses such as equipment replenishment, straw shoes, and rice subsidies are not included. Based on the current national tax revenue, the monthly revenue is at most only 700,000 yuan. It is uncertain whether this amount can be maintained regularly. Even if it is fortunate to have this amount, it is only enough to pay for food. In terms of salary, there is a difference of more than half. Therefore, the salaries of my subordinate's officers and soldiers have been in arrears for as long as four months. Previously, when the war was at its most intense, a total of 1.4 million yuan was allocated from the Hunan Provincial Education Fund, the Hunan Disaster Relief Fund, and special commercial loans to barely raise the salaries for May and July. As for the 650,000 yuan owed in June and the 700,000 yuan owed in each of August, September, and October, totaling 3 million yuan, there is no way to raise it. Every time I think of the officers and soldiers enduring the hardships of bullets and shells and the difficulties of saving for their livelihoods, I am extremely anxious. According to the current situation, if no urgent measures are taken to remedy the situation, I am afraid that the arrears will become deeper and the difficulties will become greater. Even the item of food is currently extremely difficult, and the future is uncertain. The impact on the pacification will be even deeper and greater. In our Central Government's overall planning, the situation in Hunan Province is naturally well understood. Your subordinate is awaiting punishment in the military and only wants to barely manage and should try his best to economize and never dare to burden the Central Government with financial difficulties. However, the fact is that it is difficult to cook without rice. I have repeatedly requested that all of Hunan Province's special taxes be temporarily allocated for use in Hunan Province to relieve the immediate urgency. This is the reason why the national and local taxes of Hunan Province have already been divided, and the administrative expenses, party expenses, and education expenses are in the same difficult situation. Not only is there nothing to divert, but the 1.4 million yuan previously allocated must be returned urgently. Your subordinate is in this difficult situation and dare not conceal it from the higher authorities. I earnestly beg you to understand this difficult situation and quickly grant relief. I am overwhelmed with anxiety and gratitude.)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Jinan Telephone Company's Appeal Judgment <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Permission to Revoke Provisional Execution</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The case of Ma Guanhe, the former general manager of Jinan Telephone Company, privately borrowing 420,000 Japanese yen from the Japanese Dongtuo Company, the Jinan District Court ordered the telephone company to repay the Dongtuo Company's loan and ruled for provisional execution. The telephone company refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Shandong Higher Court, requesting the revocation of provisional execution. Yesterday, the court ruled to allow the revocation of provisional execution. The telephone communication in Jinan City will not fall into the hands of the Japanese for the time being. As for the telephone company's denial of repaying the loan on behalf of Ma Guanhe, it has also appealed to the Higher Court. The judgment revoking the provisional execution is recorded below:</p>
<p>Shandong Higher Court Civil Second Instance Judgment No. 35 of the 19th Year, Original Text. Appellant: Jinan Telephone Company, Legal Representative Han Chunyi, Litigation Agents Yan Chenghan (Lawyer), Jia Rongqing (Lawyer). Appellee: Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha, Legal Representative Kagawa Masao, Litigation Agent Yoshida Kanu, two parties involved in a case of provisional execution. The appellant refused to accept the first instance judgment made by the Jinan District Court on October 3 of this year and filed an appeal. After trial by this court, the judgment is as follows: (Main Text: (The part of the original judgment regarding provisional execution is revoked. The appellee's request for provisional execution in the original trial is rejected. The litigation costs of the second trial shall be borne by the appellee. (Facts) The Japanese Toyo Takushoku Kabushiki Kaisha filed a lawsuit in the original trial against the defendants Ma Guanhe and Jinan Telephone Company, seeking compensation of 420,000 Japanese yen in principal and interest on various loans from the date of the debt until the end of the execution. The original trial ordered the defendants to jointly and severally repay the aforementioned principal and interest and declared provisional execution. Jinan Telephone Company declared its dissatisfaction with the entire original judgment and, in accordance with the provisions of Article 523 of the Civil Procedure Law, requested that the appeal regarding provisional execution be tried first. After this court held a hearing on the provisional execution part on a scheduled date, the appellee was legally summoned but was late for the oral argument date and did not arrive. In accordance with Article 457, Paragraph 1 of the same law, a judgment shall be made. (Reasons) The appellant's argument briefly states that this case is a monetary debt and there is no reason why it cannot be calculated. Regardless of whether Ma Guanhe is still wealthy, even considering the company itself, it has original assets of more than 1.6 million yuan. As certified by the accountant's audit, this year's continued investment is even more than 360,000 yuan, totaling more than 2 million yuan. Although there are other debts of 100,000 yuan, the assets still exceed the appellee's debt amount by a large margin. Although the machinery and equipment are worn out, it cannot be suddenly reduced to the point where it is difficult to offset. Furthermore, the company is engaged in telecommunications and transportation services. If the provisional execution affects the intangible losses or prevents the restoration of the original state, how difficult would it be to calculate the compensation problem in the future? The original judgment declaring provisional execution is inappropriate in both fact and law. Article 463, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulates that if the creditor explains that there is a risk of suffering damages that are difficult to offset or difficult to calculate before the judgment is final, the court shall declare provisional execution upon its request. This article stipulates that it is difficult to offset, not insufficient to pay off. Furthermore, this case is a monetary debt with a fixed price that can be calculated, so there is no problem of difficulty in calculation. The original judgment still relied on the appellee's request, pointing to the appellant's property depreciating over time and not being presented for repayment of the debt as difficult to offset, and stating that the economic situation in society and the fluctuation of gold prices were uncertain as difficult to calculate, and hastily declared provisional execution. This is extremely inappropriate. Furthermore, if provisional execution is actually implemented in this case, the appellant's business will inevitably be suspended or other obstacles will occur, and it will inevitably suffer losses that cannot be recovered in the future. According to Article 464, Paragraph 1 of the same law (If the debtor explains that there is a risk of suffering irreparable damage due to provisional execution, if it is the situation in Article 462, the court shall declare that provisional execution is not allowed upon its request. If it is the situation in the previous article, the creditor's request shall be rejected), the appellee's request for provisional execution should also be rejected. Based on the above conclusions, the appeal in this case should be deemed reasonable. In accordance with Articles 518 and 97 of the same law, the judgment is specially made as in the main text. Presiding Judge of the Second Civil Division of the Shandong Higher Court: Yu Jianshu, Judge Yi Xin, Judge Ding Yikui, November 17, 19th Year of the Republic of China. This document is certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Yan Huaqi, November 18, 19th Year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Conflict Between Liu's Army and the Militia in Pingdu <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>More Than 500 Civilian Houses Were Burned</p>
<p>More Than 30 Villagers Died</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The original infantry regiment of Liu Zhennian's troops stationed in Pingdu had previously clashed with the local militia due to an incident. After mediation by various parties, they had been at peace for several months. Unexpectedly, last night (13th), the troops stationed in Liu's army suddenly clashed again with the Tinglanqiu militia, resulting in a tragic death toll and the arrest of more than 100 farmers. Previously, Tinglanqiu in the southwest of Pingdu was the most prosperous area in the county. It had a self-defense militia with sufficient guns and ammunition, with more than 60 militiamen. The militia commander, Liu Desheng, had previously served as an army battalion commander and had always been at odds with Liu's army stationed in Pingdu. Someone reported that Liu Desheng had illegal activities in the village. Liu's army hated Liu Desheng's stubbornness and knew that his weapons were sophisticated, and repeatedly wanted to seize them for their own use. Therefore, they used the pretext of a meeting to trick Liu into the city and detain him. Then, on the night of the 13th, they dispatched about 300 soldiers to surround Tinglanqiu on all sides, launching an attack on one side and setting fire to the four gates on the other. The militia had no leadership and was in an isolated position. After a long and bitter battle, their ammunition was running out. The militiamen knew they could not resist and fled out of the encirclement in the middle of the night. Liu's army did not dare to pursue them deeply and rushed into the village. At that time, flames rose from all sides, burning down most of the village. The cries of women and children were unbearable to hear. After the incident, it was investigated that more than 500 houses were burned down, and about 30 men, women, old and young were burned and shot to death. Countless people were injured. Before leaving, Liu's army also took more than 100 farmers to Pingdu City for detention. How to deal with them is still unknown. After the incident, the Pingdu County Magistrate reported the situation to Commander Liu Zhennian in Yantai and Chairman Han Fuju in Jinan. Commander Liu immediately sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate the truth and will deal with the matter impartially to appease public anger and uphold military discipline. It is also heard that the gentry in the county convened a temporary meeting the day before yesterday to discuss how to deal with the aftermath in order to find ways to comfort the victims and resolved to jointly request Commander Liu to release all the farmers who were taken away to show leniency (November 15).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Han Fuju Reviews the Shandong Provincial Militia <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Provincial Government Chairman and Commander-in-Chief of the Provincial Militia Han Fuju believes that the militia in various parts of Shandong has now been largely organized and should be reviewed to verify the situation. Therefore, he specially ordered Xu Wenyao, the Deputy Commander of the 14th Army, to review the provincial militia yesterday and issued seven review regulations for compliance. After receiving the order, Xu decided to take the headquarters staff, adjutants, quartermasters, and armory personnel, one from each department, to Runan to review the militia of Commander Wang Wanqing's department first, and then go to other places for review. The instructions and review regulations of Han are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Instructions: To order compliance with matters. It is investigated that the general headquarters of the militia in various parts of the province have reported that they have been organized and should be reviewed to verify the situation. The deputy commander is hereby dispatched to lead four candidates waiting for assignment to the various departments for review one by one. In addition to notifying the commanders-in-chief of the various routes, regulations are hereby stipulated to order the deputy commander to go to the various departments for review one by one and report in detail as soon as possible. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Regulations: Article 1: All soldiers transferred from various county militias to the general headquarters for organization shall be subject to this regulation for review. Article 2: Reviewers shall handle matters in accordance with the methods specified in this regulation and shall not be perfunctory or negligent.

<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Chen Diaoyuan, the General Commander of the General Reserve Corps, recently stationed the 55th and 57th Divisions of his unit in southern Anhui and the border between Jiangxi and Hubei. The headquarters was remotely located in Bengbu. As he felt inconvenient in managing military affairs, he specially ordered the unit and the headquarters of the 26th Army to move to Anqing yesterday (18th) so that they could work nearby to receive the effect of command. After receiving the order, the headquarters' adjutant office sent someone to the station to negotiate and prepare a train, and notified the personnel of the two departments to board the train at 6:00 p.m. Only at 12:00 p.m. did the various departments finish moving their belongings. This morning (19th) at 1:30 a.m., the Chief of Staff of the headquarters, Li Kang, led the staff, adjutants, quartermasters, armory, telecommunications secretaries, officers, soldiers, and personnel of the 26th Army headquarters to the south by train. First, he ordered the Guangwu Team armored car (i.e., the steel armored car captured from the Jin Army in Henan) to escort them. After arriving at Pukou, the personnel of the two departments transferred to riverboats and went straight to Anhui. In addition, Shi Zhongcheng's unit, the First Anhui Guard Brigade directly under the headquarters, received an order one day earlier to go to Taihu in southern Anhui to prevent the Communist bandits from fleeing east from the Jiangxi border. The officers and soldiers of the brigade boarded the train one after another yesterday (18th) morning. At 10:00 a.m., Shi Zhongcheng also led the personnel of the various departments of the brigade and the directly subordinate units to the south by train. The First Regiment of the brigade, Zhou Yizhong's unit, stationed in Linhuai, also departed by train on the same day. The First and Second Battalions and the regimental headquarters of the Second Regiment, Yu Jinbang's unit, left Bengbu by train at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon (19th) and all went to Taihu. The Third Battalion remained in Bengbu. As for the Second Anhui Brigade, Chen Xiaosi, which was transferred from Chengwu in western Shandong to northern Anhui, has now been concentrated. The brigade headquarters and the directly subordinate units and the First Regiment, Li Chaoying's unit, are all stationed in Haozhou. The Second Regiment, Qu Zheng's unit, is stationed in Yongyang, Mengcheng, and Lieshan. The defense here is still undertaken by Wei Lihuang's 45th Division (November 19).</p>
<h3 id="e81">Joint Suppression of Bandits in Various Counties Under Xuzhou's Jurisdiction <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The bandits in the counties under Xuzhou's jurisdiction have recently been quite rampant. Generally, one part is the bandits in the area bordering Xudong, Su, Sui, and Si, and the other part is the bandits in the area around Xixi, Tong, Xiao, and Su. They are all being suppressed. The bandits in Xudong are led by Liu Rongduo, Wang Zhenbiao, Wei Yousan, Zhang Maoyang, etc., who have united about a thousand people and appear in the border area of Suqian, Suining, and Siyang. Lingcheng, Buzi, and other places are especially bandit dens. Han Deqin, the commander of the 52nd Division, recently sent Liu Jiashu, the commander of the Fourth Regiment, to suppress them. Since the 9th, they have been fighting fiercely with the bandits in Lingcheng and Buzi. Liu Yan, the county magistrate of Suqian, and Guo Jianming, the county magistrate of Suining, led the police force and local militias to block and suppress them. More than 100 bandits were killed, more than 50 guns were seized, and the bandit leader Sha Huozi was captured alive. County Magistrate Liu telegraphed Han on the 10th, saying that the remnants of the bandit gangs had fled to the southwest. County Magistrate Guo also came to Xuzhou yesterday to ask Han to send additional troops to block them so as to completely eliminate the bandits in one fell swoop. The bandit leaders in Xixi are Zhang Chuanwen, Sun Zhaohai, etc., who use Caili as a bandit den and collude with the bandits of San Mao Hou's unit in Bao'an Mountain and Shanchengji in northwestern Xiao County, causing extremely tragic killings and looting. Now, Su County has initiated a large-scale joint suppression with Xiao and Tong counties. Wang Gongyu, the County Magistrate of Xiao County, and Yang Wei, the County Magistrate of Tongshan County, have sent police detachments to Caili to join the Su County police team. It is reported that they opened fire on the 12th. Caili is composed of several small villages, covering an area of more than 20 li, spanning the three borders of Tong, Xiao, and Su, so it is easy for bandits to hide. There are also the names of East, West, South, North, and Middle Caili. The main force of the bandits' gathering is also uncertain. It is expected that the joint suppression by the three counties will not be difficult to completely eliminate them. However, the police team lacks heavy artillery, or it may still need assistance from the army (15th).</p>

<p>Double Plank Bridge Robbers Commit Robbery In the area of Shuangbanqiao (Double Plank Bridge), at the border of the Eleventh District (Nanyan Township) and the Twelfth District (Taibo Township) of Wuxi, there is a Tainan Elementary School that has been established for over ten years. The school was founded by Yang Jichen, who is from Jinxiang in Nanyan Township and is currently the head of that township. The school currently has over fifty students. The principal is Yin Weixin, and the teacher is Bo Liang. The school servant, Cao Tingda, joined the school this spring at the age of fifty-one. He is from Xueyan Bridge. The other evening, Principal Yin and the teacher went to the home of Yang Jichen, a nearby school board member, to discuss opening a branch school. Only Cao Tingda was left at the school to guard the door. After the meeting, Yin and the others returned to the school late at night, around 2:00 AM. To their surprise, they found the school gate wide open and three or four bamboo poles lying beside it. Realizing something had happened, they rushed inside and found Cao Tingda lying on Teacher Gong's bed with a bullet hole in his forehead, the bed covered in blood. He was barely breathing and unconscious. The room was in disarray. Realizing that the school had been robbed, they checked for losses.

<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed each university and the education departments and bureaus of each province and city to order provincial and registered private universities to submit their organizational charters in accordance with the order. The order stated: "The investigation of the organizational structures and staffing of each university should comply with the 'University Organization Law' and the 'University Regulations', and amendments should be made in accordance with the Ministry's Order No. 1151 issued in August of the 18th year. However, over the past year, some have submitted amended charters to the Ministry for filing, some have responded that they will comply, and some have not submitted any response. This disparity is insufficient for assessment and supervision. This order reiterates the previous order. All schools, regardless of whether they have filed amendments, should submit their amended organizational structure charters for review. The order should be followed."</p>

<h3 id="e102">Overview of Education in Huai'an County <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Jin Yingyuan, a local education investigator from the Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education in Jiangsu Province, recently completed an investigation of education in Huai'an County. The following is an excerpt of the overview:</p>
<p>In recent years, the state of education in Huai'an County has entered a period of stability. Director Wei Lin has governed in an orderly manner, and his efforts in reorganizing and increasing funding have been quite effective. Since taking office, he has been able to issue funds on a monthly basis without any arrears. The internal organization and all facilities of the bureau have been restored to their former state. As a result, the staff of each school can focus on teaching, and the content has gradually improved. All application forms are printed and distributed by the Education Bureau, making the administration more consistent. The budget for the 19th year has already been established. New projects in general education include the establishment of kindergartens, public natural science laboratories, and the addition of higher-level compulsory education in Zhangyang Elementary School. In addition to establishing ten more schools, five levels (eleven levels in total) will be added. In social education, a public education experimental zone will be added (Cheqiao). In addition, the salaries of elementary school teachers will be increased by 70 yuan per grade (18th year), 150 yuan per grade (this year), and 220 yuan per grade (this year). Those with a salary of less than 500 yuan will have their salaries increased to that amount. This will have a significant impact on the future development of education in the county. Various statistics for this year have been compiled successively, which shows the spirit of the Education Bureau's work.</p>
<p>(1) Funding: The budget for the 19th year has already been established. The income includes 111,957 yuan from surtaxes and levies, 4280 yuan from miscellaneous taxes and surtaxes, 4696 yuan from special donations, 490 yuan from miscellaneous donations, 11,490 yuan from property, 3542 yuan from tuition and lodging fees, and 60 yuan from supplementary funds, for a total of 136,542 yuan. The expenditures include 14,718 yuan for education administration, 32,214 yuan for general education, 54,050 yuan for compulsory education, 24,714 yuan for social education, 41,129 yuan for special expenses, and the first reserve fund for the year. Because the budget income for this year is listed based on the actual amount collected, the figures are not complete and have not been included.</p>
<p>(2) Compulsory Education: The entire county is divided into six districts, with a population of 670,967. Of the children of school age, 7,357 are enrolled in schools and 94,816 are not. There are 106 primary schools with 154 levels, occupying 17,161 yuan. There are 125 private schools with 1,828 students. This year, a simple primary school will be piloted in the city, with 97 students divided into two levels and two classrooms. The two levels will be taught, and one level will rotate to another location for work. In the future, if the number of students increases, there will be three levels of classes in one classroom each day, which will be more economical. The county-run middle school has a normal school department with 75 students in the first and second years. Tuition is not charged, and the students receive the same treatment as the students in the middle school department. Two classes have graduated and are serving in elementary schools in the county. When compulsory education is promoted in the future, it seems appropriate to move it to rural areas so that the spirit can be focused and the graduates can serve the rural areas. There are a total of 219 teachers in the county. Nineteen have graduated from normal schools and senior high normal schools, 95 have graduated from county normal schools, 15 have graduated from normal training courses, three have graduated from one-year normal schools, 26 have graduated from the old system middle schools and higher-level middle schools, and nine have passed examinations. It is found that a small number of unqualified teachers are still employed in the county. In the future, the method of promotion will involve increasing the land tax by 6.6% to provide relief and gradually adding simple primary schools to provide relief to those who have dropped out of school. It is suggested to open a teachers' association or correspondence course to increase new knowledge. The existing compulsory education funds will be used for new projects, amounting to 54,050 yuan. There are no accumulated savings (to be continued).</p>

<p>Municipal Music Hall, Library, and Museum to be Established In addition to using part of the city's Confucius Temple for the Municipal Minglun Elementary School, the remaining buildings will be preserved and may not be used for other purposes. However, due to years of disrepair, the buildings are becoming increasingly dilapidated. It has been reported that the Education and Public Works Bureaus plan to comprehensively renovate the entire Confucius Temple to preserve the historical site and build libraries, music halls, museums, zoos, and other facilities on the surrounding open spaces. To ensure uniform architecture, the new buildings will be generally similar in appearance to the Confucius Temple, making them extremely grand and elegant. This will enable citizens to learn from the ancient sites while also having a place to improve their virtue and rest. Yesterday afternoon, Director Xu of the Education Bureau, Section Chief Li, Director Shen of the Public Works Bureau, Section Chiefs Xue and Huang, and Consultant Dong visited the site to conduct a detailed survey. It was decided that the Public Works Bureau would draft a plan as soon as possible, and after the two bureaus make a decision, a contractor will be hired. The western district is a school area.

<h3 id="e108">Student Petition to Retain President Ma at China Public School <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Urgent Plea for Professors to Resume Classes</p>
<p>Students at China Public School, concerned that the prolonged absence of certain professors, such as Gao Yihan and Sun Bo [    ], exceeding a month, is significantly hindering their studies, have dispatched a delegation of student representatives with an urgent letter. The petition to the board of directors and the letter to the professors are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Joint Petition to the Board of Directors: Reiterate Previous Request for Rescinding the Approval of President Ma's Resignation and Investigating the Masterminds Behind the Recent Uprising</p>
<p>Regarding our plea to your esteemed council to rescind the approval of President Ma's resignation, the entire student delegation has submitted a request for your review, which has been pending for quite some time without a concrete response. The entire student body is in a state of anxious anticipation. This is because unscrupulous and wicked individuals (such as Ding [    ] Yin) have exhausted their deceptive tactics and engaged in malicious rumors. Recently, they have incited the morally bankrupt elements Li [ ], Yan Jingzhao, and others to instigate a small minority of students to form an illegal organization called the "China Public School Academic Crisis Resolution Alliance," engaging in disruptive activities. Furthermore, School Board Member Mr. You Ren declared upon visiting the school that he lacked the time and energy to serve as president. Therefore, to express the unanimous will of the entire student body to retain President Ma and urge your esteemed council to convene a meeting to resolve this matter promptly, we have reluctantly resolved to initiate a strike. Subsequently, School Board Members Yun and Hu Shi brought a letter from President Ma himself to persuade the students to resume classes. At the time, we were deeply moved by the sincere entreaties of President Ma and Board Members Hu and Wang, who demonstrated genuine concern for our well-being. We reluctantly resumed classes, awaiting a resolution. However, several days have passed since the resumption of classes, and your esteemed council has not yet convened a meeting to rescind the approval of President Ma's resignation. This leaves us in a state of profound doubt, and it appears that our resumption of classes was misguided and failed to adequately express the entire student body's enthusiasm for supporting President Ma and protecting the school to your esteemed council. In order to achieve our objectives, we are compelled to prepare for a second strike to demonstrate our unwavering commitment to upholding [ ].</p>
<p>We believe that your esteemed council members possess even greater sincerity than us, and we trust that you have gained a clear understanding of the rights and wrongs of this uprising. The situation at the school is causing anxiety and chaos among students and staff, and it is teetering on the brink of collapse. Only your esteemed council can rectify the situation and prevent the school from crumbling. We are compelled to reiterate our request and present our final demand. We implore your esteemed council to consider our plea, convene a meeting promptly, rescind the approval of President Ma's resignation, and investigate the masterminds behind this uprising, such as Ding [   ] Yin, revoking Ding's school [ ] qualifications, removing him from his duties as secretary, and restoring fairness [   ] and [ ] the school's foundation. We await your decision with utmost urgency. Respectfully submitted to Chairman Cai of the China Public School Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Letter to the Professors:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this unrest, our group has consistently prioritized the valuable time of all students and made sacrifices for their sake. Therefore, from the outset of the unrest, we have strenuously urged students to remain calm and urged professors to attend their classes. We visited the board of directors three times, hoping they would listen to the collective will of all students. However, we repeatedly ignored the expansion of the unrest. Furthermore, morally bankrupt students and their henchmen spared no effort in spreading rumors and creating chaos. The future of our entire student body appeared bleak, forcing us to engage in a three-day strike, a loss that has not been seen in years. This is truly regrettable. Later, we followed the advice of President Ma and Executive Board Members Hu and Wang and reluctantly resumed classes. President Ma immediately sent letters to all professors, requesting that they return to the school to teach. These are undeniable facts. However, you, esteemed professors, have disregarded our intentions and have inexplicably been absent from classes for over a month. You have neither proactively sought a replacement nor requested the registrar to hire capable individuals. You are treating the studies that all students value as child's play. The students have already suffered significant losses. Can you, esteemed professors, truly claim to have a clear conscience? Moreover, the responsibility of a professor is merely to teach, and the right of a student is merely to study. Your actions, esteemed professors, constitute an abandonment of your responsibilities and an infringement upon the rights of others. There is no greater disservice to students than this. We hope that you, esteemed professors, will carefully reconsider your actions and immediately return to the school to resume your classes. Otherwise, for the sake of the interests of the students, our group will have no choice but to request that the school authorities hire replacements. Do not say that we did not warn you. Respectfully, the China Public School Student Delegation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Declaration of the Entire Student Body of the Labor Agricultural College (Continued) <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Moreover, the knowledge of Fang and Wu is superficial, and the errors in their daily lectures are too numerous to list, causing embarrassment and ridicule. Now, instead of focusing on the issue of coercing the dean and preventing the appointment of Shanghai professors, the professors are prioritizing the expulsion of Professors Fang and Wu. What does this mean? Are we to believe that our studies are insignificant, while the advancement of Fang and Wu is of utmost importance? Are we to bow our heads and be manipulated as puppets? Or are we to offend and enrage the elders simply because we have disrespected the two professors? This is another perplexing question. In summary, right and wrong have already been publicly debated. However, the professors' keen observations are being ignored, and where is the truth? Since Professors Chen, Fang, and Wu have already been expelled, they will undoubtedly be too ashamed to return to the college to teach. According to news from the secretary's office published in the Shen Bao, all professors and department heads of the agricultural college are on strike due to the expulsion of Professors Chen, Fang, and Wu. However, the remaining professors, such as Zhang Lifan, Zhou Shili, and Zhang Nong, have all submitted leave requests. How can the claim of a strike be fabricated? Professor Zhang Nong has already returned to the college to make up for missed classes. Therefore, the statement by Professors Su and Fang that the college is filled with spies, forcing them to be unable to perform their duties, is clearly absurd. Even if we assume that the leave requests of Professors Zhang and Zhou constitute a strike, it is only a small</p>
<p>number of professors. How can it be claimed that all department heads and professors are on strike? The secretary's office is fabricating rumors to mislead the public. How insidious and absurd! (3) Regarding the secret agreement of Mr. Fang Cheng, the announcement of this matter came directly from Fang himself. On that day, representatives from the agronomy and chemistry departments can confirm the details. After the Ministry of Education issued an order to take over Labor University and provide police assistance if necessary, Fang Cheng returned to Shanghai from Beijing the next day. He gathered representatives from the chemistry department and claimed that he had been summoned by President Yi. He boasted that Director Li had colluded with the Ministry of Education to establish a twelve-article secret agreement. The classmates were shocked. He stated resolutely: "My pursuit of this matter is solely for the benefit of the students and stems entirely from my conscience." Mr. Fang must still remember. Before the blood was even dry, he denied the matter, using Minister Jiang's twelve points of opinion on Labor University as a cover. Even if Mr. Fang is adept at denial, the representatives from the agronomy and chemistry departments were not just one or two people, and they had no personal grudges against Mr. Fang. They would never fabricate anything to slander him. Where is Mr. Fang's so-called conscience? He denied his own words and denied his own actions. What is Mr. Fang's integrity? Shouldn't he be ashamed and invite ridicule? Looking back, Mr. Xiong Zirong announced to the students at the memorial week on November 10 that President Yi did not summon Fang to Beijing. Therefore, the secret agreement problem is self-defeating. As for the letter to President Li, we have no need to comment on the fact that the letter was not signed. However, to clarify the truth, we dare to ask Cuiyi whether Gao Jiaju and Jin Ercheng stated to the students before and after November 10 that they did not sign the letter. On November 14, Professor Zhang Nong came to the college to participate in the chrysanthemum exhibition. During a conversation with the students in the reception room, Zhang said that he had not been informed of the contents of the letter beforehand, and the [ ] of the signature was still under investigation. He also criticized the professors' strike as inappropriate. On November 17, Zhang angrily said at the memorial week that he signed at the end and was not legally responsible. Is the remaining signatory to be held responsible? Professor Zhang had already signed the letter but told people that it was still under investigation, and he also said that he was not legally responsible. Is it not ridiculous for him to deceive others and deceive himself? In summary, the students involved in the letter from Fang et al. were arbitrarily slandered with baseless (weapons) (tools) and other terms, sacrificing the personality of the entire college's youth for no reason. Their premeditated conspiracies are evident. A group of unscrupulous scholars is extremely bored. In addition to requesting that the president return to the college to preside over the affairs, we also hope that people from all walks of life, as well as the teachers and students of our school, will not be frightened by alarming words. Then our studies will be fortunate, the agricultural college will be fortunate, and the future of Labor University will be fortunate. This is our declaration. The entire student body of the National Labor University Agricultural College, November 18, 1920 (End)</p>

<p>Sanlin School in Sanlintang, Pudong, was founded in the 29th year of Emperor Guangxu's reign (1902) of the Qing Dynasty. Since Ding Guanyan served as the school principal, the school has achieved remarkable results and gained the trust of the local people. Since 1919, a vocational high school has been added. Because the original elementary school buildings were insufficient, seven new buildings were added south of the school's Tianchi by a resolution of the school council. The school held a completion ceremony and the 29th-anniversary celebration yesterday. Those present were Director Shi of the County Education Bureau, [ ] Yanqiu, Director of the County Propaganda Department, [ ] Section Chief of the Construction Bureau, and more than 1,000 guests, alumni, and guests. A grand carnival was held in the afternoon, featuring various new plays. The performances were wonderful until 7:00 PM, when the event ended in joy.</p>

<p>There are three games tonight.</p>
<p>There were three games in the Xiqing basketball game last night. The strength of each side was limited, so the games were quite interesting. There are three games tonight, two in Group A and one in Group B, starting at 7:00.</p>
<h3 id="e114">(1) Jiangwan Beats Laoda (Group A) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>In one fell swoop, Jiangwan, the pseudonym of the Fudan University basketball team, is one of the new teams in Group A this year. Yesterday, in their first match, they defeated Laoda with a score of 41 to 26. It is hoped that they will be able to win a place in the championship. In the first five minutes of the game, neither side performed well. It was not until Guan Jinlin made a free throw and Zhang Jinxiang followed up with a long shot that Yang Shufan of Laoda also raised his arms and threw in a goal. Jiangwan's three forwards were agile and often attacked, but they missed many shots. Otherwise, the score would have increased greatly. Afterwards, Wu of Jiangwan and Wang of Laoda each scored a goal, making the score six to four. Jiangwan took the lead. At this time, Jiangwan suddenly advanced and scored three goals in the blink of an eye, gaining momentum.</p>

<p>Laoda's attack failed, and they immediately stopped to discuss tactics and try to counterattack. Song Jinhai took the lead, followed by Zeng Wang, making the score twelve to eight, very close. At this time, Laoda's forward momentum was very strong, and there was a possibility of reversing the defeat. However, because the shots were inaccurate, they still succumbed to Jiangwan. The first half ended with Laoda trailing by twelve to nineteen.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second half, Laoda's team was greatly strengthened and scored two consecutive goals. Zhang Jinxiang of Jiangwan scored a long shot to boost the spirit of the whole team and regain the lead. The score difference was about ten points. However, after 31 to 20, Laoda had a resurgence of vigor, reaching 31 to 26. The overall trend showed that Laoda was turning the tide.</p>

<p>Guan Jinlin made a sudden shot, and Zhang, Wu, and Mo scored one after another. Thus, Jiangwan's score was higher. Jiangwan had the victory in hand, and the military's heart was stabilized. Finally, Guan Jinlin scored another goal, adding icing to the cake. As a result, they won with a score of 41 to 26. Referee: Bo La Tuo.</p>
<h3 id="e118">(2) Law School Beats Jiyong (Group B1) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The silver flute [ ] Jiyong courageously advanced. Luo Zhaojiong took the lead. Luo's skills were good, and he made several consecutive free throws. Huang Juying, center of Shanghai Law School, first made a free throw and then threw it in. The score between the two sides was very close. In the first half, Jiyong scored eight points and the Law School scored seven points. In the second half, the Law School improved greatly with the addition of Liu Peichang. Within seven minutes, they turned the tide and took a ten to eight lead. Jiyong worked hard to catch up, and the score was close again. After that, the changes were always within one point. The final result was that the Law School won with a score of 19 to 16. Referee: Luo Xunna.</p>

<p>Yuezhong took the lead, scoring repeatedly, leading by five to two and eleven to five. Nanying then adjusted its troops, and the atmosphere gradually improved. Before long, the score was tied at eleven. Yuezhong's Tie Depeng's goal allowed them to take a thirteen to eleven lead in the first half. In the second battle, the South [ ] was energetic and leaped forward, taking a twenty to seventeen lead. In this critical situation, Yuezhong was fortunate to rely on Cheng Jingxing's two goals to turn the tide. After that, they were invincible and scored every time. As a result, they won with a score of 33 to 20.</p>

<h3 id="e124">A Joyful Banquet Between Canadian and Chinese Merchants <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>—Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Canadian trade delegation's visit to Shanghai has been valued by all parties. This newspaper has published a special issue to carry news about this item. However, due to space constraints, trivial matters cannot be included. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hosted a public banquet to welcome the delegation on the second day of their arrival in Shanghai, and I also went there. Therefore, I have a more accurate understanding of what I heard and saw. I would like to add the following details that were not included in the news reports:</p>
<p>The time for the joyful banquet was set at 7:30 PM. Chrysanthemums were placed all over the sides of the escalators, and the national flags of China and Canada were crossed at the entrance. The interior was covered with red carpets. The venue was in the regular meeting room across from the reception room, where the half-length portrait of the Prime Minister was placed. On the four walls were six triangular welcome flags with blue backgrounds and white characters in both Chinese and Western languages. The seats were arranged in a mountain shape, and the tables were filled with chrysanthemums and covered with white carpets. The dishes were contracted by Xinghualou. Each guest had a specially printed five-color hard paper menu with gold lettering measuring three inches wide and six inches long, detailing the names of nine dishes, two snacks, and four fruits, also listed in both Chinese and Western languages. The cutlery and plates were very beautiful. In order to promote domestic products, the banquet was a large-scale Chinese style banquet, and the cigarettes and wine were all products of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Changyu Pioneer Wine Company. Among the Canadian merchants, there were six female guests. Four of them wore black clothes, one wore gray, and the other wore bright red, which was very eye-catching. The guests were divided into two-thirds Chinese and one-half in gowns. Mr. Wang Xiaolai sat in the middle of the chairman's seat, with the head of the delegation, Yemuli, on the left and a female guest in a black coat with a white leather collar on the right. Xie Fusheng sat opposite Chairman Wang, with two Canadian merchants on either side. Because they usually eat with knives and forks and chopsticks are the only ones they have ever seen in their lives, there were many jokes about not knowing how to use them. Sometimes, the Chinese next to them would teach them how to use chopsticks. Those who were clever would try to use them and their satisfied expression would be shown on their faces. Those who were slow to learn would try repeatedly without success, their faces would turn red, and they would laugh loudly. The female guest in red had trouble getting the chopsticks to obey her commands, so she ordered the servant to add knives and forks. The most difficult dish to eat with chopsticks was Yifu noodles. Even after trying dozens of times, the noodles and chopsticks still could not connect, so she abandoned the chopsticks and changed to a fork and magnetic spoon. It took her several tens of minutes to eat a few noodles. It was also difficult. When the wine was half drunk, Wang Xiaolai stood up to give a welcome speech, which was written in white folded paper and read in segments. Xie Fusheng translated each segment, detailing the unequal treatment of Canadian government restrictions on Chinese immigrants and factory exclusions of Chinese workers, and put forward two requirements: (1) Canada should not specially establish immigration laws for China, (2) Merchants should be allowed to come and go freely. Please understand our sincere attitude and earnest wishes and tell the Canadian authorities and all the people to abolish the immigration law against China and sign a reciprocal commercial treaty with our country. The two thousand-plus words were very straightforward. Then, Yemuli gave a reply speech, in addition to expressing his gratitude, he agreed to report to the country on the two requirements and agreed to Chairman Wang's frankness in revealing commercial obstacles for reference and requested that this speech be translated into English and printed in thousands of copies for distribution to the public after returning home so that Canadian merchants who have not been to China can learn about the Chinese psychology. It lasted for forty minutes and was also translated by Mr. Xie. During the informal conversation, the three gentlemen Zhao Jinqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Zhu Yinjiang were the most fluent in Chinese. The three gentlemen Zhao, Yuan, and Zhu had a good foundation in English and could talk directly without the need for a translator. At half past ten, Wang Xiaolai and Xie Fusheng wanted to take the night train to Beijing, so they left first. Before leaving, in addition to cupping his hands in apology, he asked Yuan Ludeng to act as chairman. At a little over eleven o'clock, the photography was finished and the banquet was over.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Talk About the Titles of Presidents <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>—Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>The Republic of China was founded, and the president changed six times. The first president was Mr. Sun Yat-sen. As the poem says, "High mountains are looked up to, and great deeds are followed." Although this mountain has collapsed for a long time, the people's hearts of admiration have never stopped. The successors were Xiangcheng, Huangpi, Hewen, and Donghai. The so-called Cheng, Pei, He, and Hai have already felt that things are getting worse and worse. They have not been restored to the palace, so they have been ordered by Cao Kun. Shan is the thing under the sea. Comparing with the mountains is no different from the three lights in the nine springs. The qualifications of the six presidents gradually coincided with the meaning of the name, and the gradual decline in the middle was in an orderly manner, without the slightest confusion, as if it were made by heaven. This is also an anecdote in the history of the Republic of China. (But reward)</p>
<h3 id="e126">Qing Shuang Sword of the Lihzi Society <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>—Aya sent from Nanjing</p>
<p>Cheng Yushuang came to the capital at the invitation of Mr. Li Shizeng to perform at the Liaoxi Relief Art Fair. She arrived in the capital on the morning of the 13th. Mr. Shu Shifu, Director of the General Affairs Bureau of the National Government's Military Counselor's Office, and officials of the Art Fair took care of everything when they got off the train. She stayed at the Anle Hotel. Recently, because the Northeast generals had just arrived in the capital, nine out of ten hotels were full. Anle was pre-booked, so she was still calm. On the evening of the 14th, Yan Qiu and others performed Qing Shuang Sword at the Lihzi Society. Chairman Jiang and his wife issued invitations in their names, inviting the Northeast generals, ambassadors from various countries, the diplomatic corps, and family members of officials above the rank of Jianren in various institutions. Those without invitations were not allowed to enter. The order was extremely strict. At around 8:00, when the ancient music of the Datong Society was played, only Mr. Zhang Jingjiang and Mr. Wu Zhihui were in the first ten rows. After Mr. Degian and Mrs. Wang Shaolou's "Second Entry to the Palace" came out, Chairman Jiang and Deputy Commander Zhang entered the room from the lounge one after another. The ambassadors of various corps and the officials entered in single file. At a little after 9:00, Yan Qiu's Qing Shuang Sword took the stage. Mayor Zhang Yuejun and Mr. Wu Tiecheng were the first to applaud, and the applause was thunderous. In the cave room scene, after getting the enemy drunk, she bent her bow and drew her sword to assassinate him. When she sacrificed at the tomb, she sang and walked. The audience was deeply moved and explained in detail, as if they were all nodding in agreement and savoring the fun. The theater could accommodate about three or four hundred people. The stage was transformed from a lecture stage. Although the sound was like a short distance behind the twentieth row, it was probably because there were acoustics experts arranged for the lecture. All the scenes were blocked by screens on the side of the stage. The people who inspected the theater were all dressed in the same long gown. Because there were hundreds of foreign guests that day, I was afraid that it would hinder the viewing. After the play, Jiang invited Yan Qiu to join the tea party. The next day, he asked Huang Renlin, the director of the Lihzi Society, to go to Yushuang's place to express his fatigue and pay his respects.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Trivial Records of the Chrysanthemum Banquet <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>—Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The Chrysanthemum Exhibition has announced its end. Ms. Yu Danhan specially invited Shanghai's prominent calligraphers, painters, and literati to a banquet at the Municipal Hall on the last day. I also participated in the banquet to celebrate the evening. I would like to record the following trivial details:</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of kinds of chrysanthemums, which are extremely elegant, floating in jade, golden in color, and fragrant. There are flowers as big as a bowl, half purple and half white, which are especially beautiful. There is also one flower per pot and one flower per stem, without leaving any other branches and leaves, which is called the Japanese chrysanthemum method. In fact, this method has already existed in our country in the old days, which is called plucking the stamens. Late autumn has not ruined the three paths. Having this in the hustle and bustle of Shanghai is enough to cleanse the viscera.</p>
<p>The calligraphy and painting exhibition displays almost everything. Zhang Shanzi's Twelve Jin钗 is titled with lyrics from the Romance of the West Chamber, but in fact, all the paintings are of Yin beasts, which is a unique opening. Qian Yunhe's Eighteen Arhats Crossing the Sea is a white-line drawing without color, delicate and unparalleled. It was purchased by Wang Xiaolai. The Ding Gaoshan Ju Shi Tu is even more elegant and divine, and is a proud work of the pen. Ms. Yu Danhan's Autumn Sound Map is elegant and pleasant. Several painted fans, Qingxi Fan Zhuo, are added with inscriptions by Zeng Nong Lao, which are especially valuable. Other works such as Ma Mengrong's Quail, Wang Taomin's Crabapple and Banana, Sun Xueni's Landscape, and Zheng Wuchang's Ink Vegetables are all worth appreciating.</p>
<p>Before entering the seat, the painters wrote flower and bird sketches on the long scroll as a unique signature. Then, Ms. Danhan was eager to invite guests to watch the dance and drink wine, and the music was endless. When the wine was half drunk, Qian Shoutie, Sun Xueni, He Tianjian and others gave speeches one after another, planning to organize a large-scale calligraphy and painting exhibition with perfect facilities, and also taking into account the welfare of calligraphers and painters after their deaths, which is a good deed. The banquet ended at ten o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Travel Notes from Southeast Asia (78) <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the tenth, I traveled with Li Zhongqian, the principal of the Zhinan Normal School. Suddenly, an airship appeared in the sky. Li said, "This ship is worth 15,000 yuan and is privately purchased by capitalists for sightseeing. If you want to ride as a passenger, it costs one yuan per minute." If you calculate it this way, an hour costs sixty yuan, equivalent to more than one hundred and thirty yuan in Chinese currency. Such an hour of amusement is quite a spectacle. I once heard from an aviator that a small airship costs no more than 10,000 yuan in China. However, if it becomes popular in the future, the price will surely drop to several thousand yuan, like today's automobiles. Several people could share a ship. However, today, the rich fly in the sky while the poor work in underground cellars. The difference is truly like heaven and earth. Can this system last long? As for the so-called educators, that is, the gentlemen and scholars, they were once the leaders of the four classes of people and teachers of others. Now, they barely make a living and run around the homes of the wealthy to seek a full meal. What value remains in their educational beliefs? Therefore, the children of wealthy families often look down on teachers. The dignity of today's teachers has also been swept away. In this situation, if we want to uphold the ancient virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor, as well as human relations and morality, and the teachings of respect for teachers and the Way, who will follow them?"</p>
<p>Han scholars once said, "The rich become licentious and commit crimes, while the poor become destitute and resort to theft. Their harm is the same." Here, gamblers at horse races use one hundred yuan as a chip, with a minimum bet of five hundred yuan per race, equivalent to over a thousand yuan in Chinese currency. Yet, in the northwest of the mainland, disaster victims cannot even get enough to eat. How can such injustice in the world be tolerated?</p>
<p>Penang Island has magnificent mountains and beautiful scenery, making it a famous scenic area in Southeast Asia. Therefore, all capitalists like to build villas here, making it a gathering place for the wealthy. Having cleverly acquired property, they build secluded retreats to live out their days, far from people and detached from all worldly affairs. This is a well-considered plan. It is said that there are also many wealthy people on Gulangyu Island in China. Some say that Gulangyu Island is the wealthiest of all places, and wealthy people are also sending money there to build villas.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth, I suffered from a fever and eye disease due to the recent heat. Across the street was a hospital run by Taoist Wang. Visiting him, I found out that he was a Taoist from Yuntai Mountain in Haizhou, Jiangsu, and a fellow Shandong native. We had a great connection. He gave me eye drops, which felt very good, but the condition did not improve after a long time. It seems there are many traveling healers in Southeast Asia who use Buddhism or Taoism as a front, selling medicine and various things. It is said that some of them often make a fortune.</p>
<p>From the 24th of the month, my eye disease has not improved, and I have been doing nothing. So, I went to Yangon, accompanied by Yang Shuanglin and Chen Youjia, also known as the monk Yitong. As soon as we boarded the ship, there was wind and rain, and I felt dizzy and vomited for three days and couldn't get up. On the morning of the 27th, we arrived in Yangon. During the journey, I only managed to write four lines of poetry:</p>
<p>Penang west, Shanghai vast and boundless,</p>
<p>Far from my homeland, near the land of Buddha.</p>
<p>Three nights of waves, weary and reluctant,</p>
<p>Once I rejoice in seeing the Great Golden Light (the Great Golden Pagoda).</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: In the Private Room, Tears of Melancholy Over Red Love; In the Audience, Hearts Captivated by Lingering Green Charm</p>
<p>Green Charm sat next to Zuo Shichen. Her eyes were still on A Su, who was performing a new patron's song. She seemed uncomfortable, her eyes fixed on A Su, like a chick clinging to its mother. Even though A Su was sitting opposite her, she noticed this. Zuo Shichen held her small hand, as white as snow and as soft as cotton, asking her about everything. Although Green Charm didn't withdraw her hand, she felt shy and only smiled at A Su. A Su had no choice but to join the conversation, saying, "Second Young Master Zuo, you must come and call for her often in the future. Don't be a Danyang visitor." Zuo Shichen asked Green Charm how old she was. Green Charm looked at A Su again. A Su replied for her, "Fifteen years old. We tell other patrons she's sixteen. But it doesn't matter telling the true age to people like the Fourth Young Master and Second Young Master." This song truly took an unusually long time. When Ling Zhixiang's first set of friends had left, and the second set hadn't arrived yet, they came to join the discussion. Everyone said that she was a rising star who would definitely be victorious in the future. They also praised her hair, eyes, and nose. When they hadn't looked at Zuo Shichen's side, they hadn't heard him speak. Now that they had been sitting for a long time, the shy mood that had just settled over them gradually dissipated. When asked what she was saying, she no longer looked at her A Su as if she were a nursemaid. However, when she spoke, there was a delicate sound, like a canary singing, or a clear and round bell. This was something that Rui Yun didn't have. It was just that her vivacity was far inferior to Rui Yun's. Everyone in the room saw that Zuo Shichen treated all the ladies he called casually, but he seemed completely focused and very nervous about Green Charm, this little girl. They couldn't help but be a little surprised. It just so happened that A Su was clinging to her and wouldn't leave. Green Charm followed her instructions, so she didn't dare to move without her permission. Everyone exchanged glances, meaning that Zuo Shichen was under a spell again. But they didn't know if it was well-intentioned or malicious. They were eagerly encouraging the two of them to be intimate. A Su asked, "Fourth Young Master, where are you having dinner tomorrow?" Long Ziyun said, "It hasn't been decided yet." Ling Zhixiang said, "Second Young Master Zuo should treat. Since we have such a good singer, where should we have dinner tomorrow?" Zuo Shichen said, "I'll definitely treat tomorrow. Where would you like to go?" Lin Fanzi said, "The guest follows the host's lead. Wherever you say is fine. We are (the five viscera, willing to follow the whip)." Zuo Shichen said, "If everyone isn't tired of Yuebinlou, we can go there again. Otherwise, a Sichuan restaurant would be good, but I'm afraid of spicy food." Long Ziyun said, "Let's just stay here. It's good to eat familiar dishes. Their business has been really good these days. Let's book a table now." After A Su and Green Charm left, their friends deliberately said, "Green Charm is really good. Green Charm is really not bad."</p>

<p>Rumors of Unsuccessful Sino-American Loan</p>
<p>The Price of Silver May Continue to Rise Slightly This Morning</p>
<p>The upward momentum weakened. Yesterday, the 20th, the situation in the silver market showed some gains and losses, but without drastic changes. The price fluctuated within two liang and six or seven qian. Looking back, it ended with a slight drop, and people felt uneasy. Transactions were not active, with only a few liang fluctuating at times. Shops like Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Yuanyongxing were buying, but Xinheng, Hengxing, and Shengren were selling. Overseas silver prices rose slightly, but were not affected by this. The morning market was peaceful at around 84 liang, and as soon as the exchange rate returned by half a dang, there was a setback. However, the open and closed markets diverged. Banks initially absorbed and then released, and there were rumors that the large Sino-American loan had not been successful. Upon receiving this news, the industry's psychology was boosted, and Yuancheng, Yuanxingyong, Yuanyongmao, and others competed to buy, causing the price to rise sharply to 86 liang. Due to hedging and other tendencies, bills of exchange were released, and the sluggish state was flattened. In the afternoon market, there were no large purchases, and only Lianbang and Zhifengyong bought in slightly. Yuanchengyong, Yuanyongmao, and retail investors released goods, and the price was very low. The final price was about 84 liang. It is said that the large silver bar may continue to rise slightly this morning.</p>
<p>The price of the large silver bar indeed rose early this morning. The opening price of silver for the current month was 584 liang and 2 qian (the gross price fluctuated around 84 liang, and there were few transactions). The prediction that the price of the large silver bar would return by one-sixteenth in the near future has now been confirmed. The forward price did not change, and the silver price rose by one-eighth, followed by a slight increase of a few qian, to 4 liang and 6 or 7 qian. Subsequently, due to Xinheng's entrustment to Jinan to sell, the price dropped by more than 2 liang, to only 82 liang and 3 qian. The exchange rate was still flat. The December gold price fluctuated at 173.125, and it could be traded. However, it was rumored that HSBC might increase the listing price, causing the market to decline.</p>
<p>The price of silver stood still. Soon, buyers became active. The initial listing price did indeed increase by 0.125 US dollars, and the East Exchange rate fell by 0.075. The gold price did not fall further and remained at 3 liang and 3 or 4 qian. This was mainly because Fuchang and others bought in, mainly because Korea had taken up the spot. The current Dalian price of 1 liang, 2 qian, 6 fen, 8.75 li, was increased again to 1 liang, 9 qian, 3 ke, at 84 liang, 2 or 3 qian. At 10:00, it retreated to 3 liang, 8 or 9 qian, and then returned by about 2 liang. This was just market manipulation. Then, Yuanheng, Yuanyongmao, Yuancheng, Yuanxingyong, and others rushed in. The news that the Sino-American loan had failed caused people to feel optimistic that the silver price would not rise. At 10:45, it reached 86 liang.</p>
<p>Hedgers resold. All shops were rushing to settle exchange bills. The one-month bill was 172.125, and the twelve-month bill was 172.5. Mitsui made the December US-Japan exchange rate at 49.625 yuan. Later, because the bank's supply was constant, Shen Da came to sell, followed by Fuchang and others, and the price fell by 2 liang and several qian. However, there were fluctuations of a few qian in between. At 11:30, it was 83 liang, 4 or 5 qian, and then it was pulled up by 1 liang. At 11:45, it was 4 liang and 3 qian. By noon, the closing price was 84 liang, and it was reduced again by 2 or 3 qian. The listing price was changed to 618 liang and 6 qian.

<p>More than forty grain businesses from Zhabei are actively purchasing from upstream sources. The market sales are in a slump. Although there are some transactions, buyers are arbitrarily reducing prices.

Dujian rice retail sales are poor, with the top price offered at 12.8 yuan or more, all short by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Wharf rice is relatively stable, with little fluctuation due to scarce goods, with a top price of 12.2 yuan. Bianyuan rice is down by 0.3 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, two or thirty grain businesses were seen in the river below Shanghai South. Local sales are sluggish, and the price decline is sharper than in the northern market, often short by 0.2 or 0.4 yuan. Top-grade goods are particularly scarce, with prices offered at 14.6 or 14.7 yuan. The sales of Sutong Baibai in urban and rural areas remain stagnant. Because of sufficient inventory, merchants continue to wait and see, while the supply has been continuous in recent days, resulting in another small drop of 0.4 or 0.5 yuan. Subang top-grade is offered at around 12.5 yuan. Nanbang Baodao and Zaodao rice are also gradually declining downstream, with high-quality goods down by 0.3 yuan. Middlemen have seen a reduction of 0.5 yuan, and wholesale reductions are extremely severe.

Coarse rice had fifty packages of Nanjing goods priced at 9 yuan, the same price as the previous market, all purchased by local businesses. The inventory of Yuan rice is still small. Yesterday, Weihaiwei businesses purchased about two hundred packages each of Gan and Xiang machine Yuan rice. Gan machine Yuan rice was priced at 14.05 yuan, and Xiang machine Yuan rice was priced at 10.2 to 10.1 yuan. Due to the small supply and customer purchases, the market situation was better than that of Ke Xian rice. Foreign rice has yet to arrive, and Japanese rice, which has already arrived, is difficult to sell due to high costs.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed an initial stabilization followed by a firming trend in the morning and afternoon sessions. After the market opened in the morning, foreign wheat quotations improved by 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 yuan. Outside parties could not help but become stable again. Currently, the long-term situation is below 1.5 yuan. According to the exchange's announcement, both parties must have a security deposit of 300 taels. In addition to actual trading, the remaining speculators will inevitably need to reduce slightly. Furthermore, the market value of foreign wheat has already been exposed. No matter what, it can only be considered as surplus in terms of physical goods and cannot be said to be worthless. Although it is currently cheaper than domestic prices, the added shipping costs are not negligible. Therefore, if there are no special circumstances in the future, it may be temporarily stabilized. As a result, this month improved by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, December improved by 0.0175 yuan, January improved by 0.015 yuan, February improved by 0.01 yuan, and March and April improved by 0.015 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon sessions of the futures wheat market opened, the trend of each month has been stable. Because the quotation of foreign wheat is slightly better, and short sellers dare not take speculative positions before foreign wheat is first settled. This is the trend of the whole section and will be the future reference. This month, it was slightly stable at the beginning. Due to the large household short-selling being manufacturers preparing to deliver goods in the future, people's hearts are still depressed. Because long-term hedging is urgent, it is slightly better than the previous day. As a result, this month is smaller by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, December is larger by 0.01 yuan, January is larger by 0.02 yuan, February is larger by 0.02 yuan, and March and April are larger by 0.02 yuan. Spot wheat is still flat and tired. More than 2,000 packages of Gaoyou and Baoying wheat were opened in the whole city, and half of them were handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Gradually Falls <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The main reason is sluggish sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market news from the production area said that the current price of Cuban sugar was 1.75, down 0.3125 from the previous report. The price of New York futures sugar was 1.25 in December, 1.38 in March next year, down 0.05, 1.46 in May, and 1.59 in September, also down 0.04. The current and futures prices of Javanese sugar have not risen or fallen. The session trading is still sluggish. The price of Dutch sugar 24 phase sand is 7 taels and 5.5 qian, and the price of coarse grains of high-quality goods is 7 taels and 6 qian, but the demand is still rare. Fine ground sand white is 7 taels and 6.5 qian, and 20 medium sand white is 6 taels and 8 qian, and there are also few inquiries. The price of 8 red is 6 taels and 3 qian, and the market is also turning to a flat price. The price of N sugar is 7 taels and 6.5 qian, TK sugar is 7 taels and 6 qian, YT sugar is 7 taels and 6 qian, YP sugar is 7 taels and 9 qian, J sugar is 7 taels and 9.5 qian, and YRO sugar is 7 taels and 1.25 qian. The import and export are declining, and the market is bleak. Although Taikoo Sugar's dumping of goods has been accommodated by the company, the price has been close to the original price. However, the industry requires that the top-grade goods account for 70%, while the company lacks B sugar, so there is no deal so far.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms' Silk Market Stops Again <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market became even more sluggish. The reason is that overseas markets are not selling silk, and Shanghai dispatches did not see any improvement. Chinese merchants have a negative attitude, and silk sales have stopped again. All kinds of factory white, yellow, and gray silk have not been sold.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Needle and Bud Green Tea European Sales Smooth <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' tea market showed that European sales of needle and bud green tea from the incoming firms have turned smoother. Jardine Matheson, Concord, and other firms have started to handle it. However, the price is still low. There are also some sporadic transactions in precious bud pearl tea and other goods. There is not much change in the market. Yesterday, there were not many transactions in Gongxi. The Russian firm Assistance Association is busy with weighing and packing more than 20,000 boxes of Gongxi tea that have been purchased because the shipping schedule is about to be released, so as to load and export them. However, it will continue to search for red and green tea in the market in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Oil Market New Asphalt Obstacles Production Area <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Only a few pieces of Xue were delivered in Hanshi... The opening trend is still high. The asphalt market is still rising due to the exhaustion of old oil reserves and the failure of new goods to be delivered. The Macheng oil firm approved 17.8 taels, but there is no goods to meet the market. It has been found that the bandit situation in the Geng production area is rampant, and transportation is blocked. Therefore, although new goods have been seen in the production area, it is still difficult to transport them to Hanjingzhou. Because of financial difficulties, Zhuang customers dare not let go. The market situation in Tianjin is sluggish, and vendors are not moving forward. Only a few pieces of Chaxue new oil have arrived in Hanshi, and the large plate has been rushed to 19 taels. Xin has also been seen in the Jinlan area of Shangjiang, Zhejiang Province. However, only 70 or 80 pieces are produced every day. The selling price has risen to 18 yuan after the opening of 17 yuan. The general trend of the oil market will not return to low prices until the new goods arrive in large quantities. The city's public offering has increased by 0.2 yuan compared to the previous period.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Piece Goods Prices Fall One After Another <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The reason lies in the sluggish sales</p>
<p>The piece goods market is bound to realize the settlement at the end of the Gregorian year, which makes the market atmosphere more and more declining, especially the wholesale in the mainland of this street is the most affected. The settlement period has been approaching day by day, and the account release has been closed. Therefore, the sales are very quiet, and the fine broadcloth, straight tribute flannel, colorful plaid velvet, Yuehua velvet, etc. of the East goods are in the peak season, and the prices are falling day by day. Yesterday, the colorful plaid velvet fell sharply by more than 0.01 yuan. Those who sold 0.02 yuan and 0.05 yuan are now only 0.01 yuan and 0.09 yuan. Those with 0.02 yuan are 0.0185 yuan, which is rare in the past. Straight tribute flannel is also soft, and the body goods have fallen sharply. Fine broadcloth, such as Huxinting, Huanle, and Sanyou, have all returned to the 0.03 yuan level. Yuehua velvet is also depressed. However, the stock of imperial concubine-colored cotton velvet is out of stock, and Liang Wudi was sold out at 0.019 yuan. Shuilang velvet rose and fell again. The existing goods of colorful light twill on the market have all been searched by the leather goods gang. Tang Taizong is 5.1 taels, Zijinshan is 5.05 taels, and few people ask about gray light twill. Yesterday, there was no way out for 4.45 taels alone. Only colorful striped velvet is still firm. Because the Shanghai stock is scarce, the Osaka price is about 7 taels, so it is unanimously bullish. Western goods are still lifeless. However, the 1.6-yuan is still active. Taihe Grand Theater is 1.225 taels, and Deji Changshengdian is 1.175 taels.</p>

<p>Speech by representative of the Ministry</p>
<p>Oath of all committee members</p>
<p>The full committee of the China General Federation of Industries held an oath-taking ceremony at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Number of attendees: Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Lin Genghou, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, and committee members Dai Gengxin, Wu Yunchu, Cai Shengbo, Qian Xuanqing, Nie Yisheng, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Chengxu, Lu Feibohong, Wang Yunwu, Wang Boqi, Shi Zuicai (represented by Zhang Zhuping), Shen Huachen, Zhu Jingan, Wang Yaochen, etc.</p>
<p>The meeting promoted Wang Yunwu as the temporary chairman. After performing the rituals, all the committee members stood solemnly and took the oath. Then, Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, delivered a speech, saying that he was very honored to be present at the inauguration of the full committee of the China General Federation of Industries. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce should have a sincere love for industry and commerce. Shanghai is one of China's major commercial ports. Your association is located in such a large port, and you should be able to seek considerable happiness for industry and commerce. China is currently suffering the most from two things. The first is that foreign goods are flooding the market and destroying domestic goods. It is painful to say. Your association is organized by industrial and commercial groups across the country and public opinion circles such as Shen and Xin newspapers. In the future, you should be able to eliminate the pain of industry and commerce. The second is the issue of labor-capital disputes. In recent years, industry and commerce have suffered a lot because of this reason. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which was recently convened, has already been held. In the future, this issue may be resolved effectively. Today, all the gentlemen who are here are giants in the industrial and commercial circles. I hope that everyone can find a way to properly maintain the original industry. Then, the Chinese industrial and commercial circles have great hope, etc. Next, Lin Kanghou gave a speech, saying that the past Chinese industry and commerce can be said to be (a dumb person eating coptis) with the pain of not being able to say anything. Today, I want to change this to (a dumb person eating sugar), which means that I hope the General Federation of Industries will change the (coptis) eaten by industry and commerce into (sugar). If so, the mission of the General Federation of Industries can be said to be great. Finally, the chairman replied, saying that all the gentlemen present are now members of this association. I am very honored to be sent to the venue by the Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for training. I would like to represent all the members to thank Director Zhao of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and sincerely hope that Director Zhao will assist the development of this association in the future with his industrial and commercial experience and knowledge in various tasks and affairs of this association, etc.</p>
<p>Inauguration Oath I swear to follow the Three Principles of the People and the teachings of the late Premier with sincerity, and to build the country for the national industry and create happiness for all members. I hereby swear.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Silk Factory Dispute Resolved Through Mediation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Labor and capital signed an agreement yesterday</p>
<p>Workers' wages are calculated at 58</p>
<p>The labor-capital dispute in the city's silk factory was caused by the capital side's regret the day before yesterday and refused the workers' request to calculate wages at 85% discount. After the Social Bureau repeatedly persuaded, the capital side expressed its concession and respected the intention of the Social Bureau. Yesterday afternoon, the mediation conditions have been signed. The situation yesterday is divided into the following:</p>
<p>At the mediation meeting at 4 pm yesterday, the capital side arrived representatives Shen Huachen and Zhang Peishen, and the labor side representatives Yu Fengtai, Chen Xiupu, Yu Qinbang, Yao Zilan, Xi Duan, Sun Dongkun, Wang Jianhao, Xu Pengnian, etc. Eight people gathered at the Social Bureau and were led into the mediation room by the bureau representative Qi Bing. At that time, both parties had expressed that there were no objections to the articles of the draft agreement the day before yesterday. However, the draft agreement ordered the day before yesterday was four articles. In order to prevent problems in the Shuang Gong Silk Factory, two articles were added yesterday, and both parties held a signing ceremony. Then, Wang Bing of the Social Bureau stood up and said to the labor side that the labor-capital dispute between the two parties has been resolved. In the future, I hope that the labor-capital parties will cooperate sincerely and help each other to prevent similar incidents from happening again. This time, the capital side representative Mr. Shen has made great efforts for this matter, and it is not easy to travel back and forth. In the future, workers should express their gratitude to Mr. Sun, etc. Next, the labor side expressed its gratitude to the Social Bureau. Finally, the labor side representative proposed that although the worker Chen Zhongxiang in Yichang has been released, he has been expelled. He requested that the capital side request the same industry association to send a letter to Yichang requesting reinstatement. The Social Bureau considered this to be another issue and will discuss it again.</p>
<p>Signing Conditions (1) The wages of all silk factory employees in Shanghai will be temporarily calculated at 85% discount of the original amount in each factory. (2) The silkworm moth subsidy obtained by the employees shall still be paid at 45% of the original salary. (3) The application work and other benefits that employees should receive shall still be in accordance with the old practice. (4) When the factory's business improves, the labor side may apply to restore the original wages, but the period of wage reduction shall be delayed until the end of May next year. (5) The treatment of employees in Shuang Gong Factory is different from that in Dan Gong Factory. If there are any changes, they must be submitted to the government for approval separately. (6) This agreement shall take effect from November.</p>
<p>Resumption of work The silk market in silk factories has slightly improved recently, and factories have resumed work one after another. According to a survey yesterday, 36 factories have resumed work. The special zone has Lunxiang, Yonglun, Xuxing, Yichang, Xukang, Xinchang, Dingyuan, Ruihe, Xiacheng, and Lunyuan. Ten factories in the West District include Shunfeng Yongxie An, Yong An, Qichang, Dingchang Sheng, Hengchang Xin, Fuchang Sheng, Fuchang Tai, Baisi First, Baisi Second, Hengkang, Fumin, Xiexing, Xiechang, Fengtai, Lichang, Yongchang, Feng Eighteen factories including etc. There are four factories in the North District: Yingfeng, Dalun, Jintai, and Fushen. There are four factories in the East District: Tianchang, Ruilun, Dingchang Xin, and Baokang. Four or five factories are expected to open today, etc.</p>

<p>Preparing for the next meeting</p>
<p>Countries express satisfaction</p>
<p>The National Government Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee held several meetings in Beijing a few days ago. Most of the diplomatic corps and creditor delegations of various countries attended. Although specific discussions were not held, the National Government expressed its intention to urgently consolidate and prepare to start consolidating the general outline on the spot. The representatives of various countries were very understanding and expressed satisfaction. Therefore, the result was very satisfactory. It is expected that the future progress will be extremely smooth. Now, Minister Song, together with Foreign Minister Wang, has ordered the cadres of the association to come to Shanghai immediately to actively prepare for the next meeting so as to notify the representatives of various countries to attend the meeting as soon as possible. Yesterday, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigeguang Kui hosted a conversation with Chinese and Japanese reporters and said that the National Government proposed the general outline for consolidating internal and external debts and hoped to implement it as soon as possible to win the sympathy of various countries. If China wants to engage in construction, it must first consolidate internal and external debts, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Urging the Release of Short-Term Treasury Bonds for Donations <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>All households that pay before the 18th will be issued customs duties treasury bonds, and those that pay after that will be given post-war treasury bonds. The Ministry of Finance's Fundraising Committee issued an important notice saying that the association has been fundraising for the 19th year customs duties short-term treasury bonds. All commercial and wealthy households in Shanghai have already been sent letters of encouragement. After investigation, it has been found that there are many households that are enthusiastically competing to purchase and pay in full, but there are also quite a few who delay watching or deliberately shirk. It must be known that the amount of fundraising determined by the ministry is divided into five grades based on the circumstances of each business, all of which are the lowest limit. The wealthy households are also only based on the standard of 40% of the actual payment of the first two-five treasury bonds. Judging from the meaning that everyone is responsible, I think each household will be able to do their best to support. At present, the situation is stable and all industries are waiting to be rebuilt. The government needs funds urgently. The association has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Ministry of Finance urging the release of treasury bonds. Households that pay before November 18th of the 19th year will be issued short-term treasury bonds for the 19th year customs duties treasury bonds. Those who pay after the 18th have also been instructed to change to short-term treasury bonds for the 19th year post-war treasury bonds. The stability of the treasury bond fund and the superior interest are exactly the same as the short-term treasury bonds for the 19th year customs duties treasury bonds, and there is no difference. It is hoped that each household will check the previous notices from the Ministry of Finance and the association and pay the full amount on the day designated by the Central China Communications Bank for collection so as to fill in the subscription bonds and exchange for treasury bonds at any time. I hope not to delay any longer. This is a special notice.</p>

All winning tickets should be returned in accordance with the original redemption date stipulated in the regulations of each bond. The Central China Communications Bank will pay. I am afraid that it is not well known, so this notice is issued. Minister Song Ziwen, November 18th, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Holders of Central Temporary Vouchers Held an Inaugural Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Eight resolutions on implementation methods</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Holders of Central Bank Temporary Exchange Vouchers and National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Bonds held an inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon and promoted Wu Deyu as the chairman. The meeting was held as scheduled. First, the chairman gave a speech, saying that the warlords Yan Feng and other reactionary forces have been wiped out, and the country is unified and the people are rejoicing. The central government is working hard to govern and renew the people. All internal and external debts are being planned and consolidated. It can be seen that the central government cares about national credit and understands the difficulties of the people. However, the Central Bank's temporary exchange vouchers were issued and circulated in the market during the military period of the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic of China. It has a completely different nature from other internal debts and must be consolidated and fully recovered as soon as possible. The National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Bonds were issued on June 30th of the 16th year and expired on December 31st of the same year. The treasury bonds were issued by the Ministry of Finance to supplement the national treasury and regulate finance. Now that they have been overdue for three years, they should be recovered immediately to alleviate the difficulties of the people, etc. Then, everyone spoke in succession and resolved the implementation methods as follows: (1) Submit a request to National Government Chairman Chiang, Premier of the Executive Yuan, and Minister of Finance to ask them to consider the difficulties of the people and fully redeem and recover the vouchers as soon as possible. (2) Send letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Industry and Commerce, and other groups in various provinces, cities, and counties to ask them to sympathize and assist in alleviating the difficulties of businesses. (3) Appoint Wu Deyu, Pan Jiazhen, Dai Dachen, Zhou Bore, Qiu Juping, Dong Xihou, Yin Xiwu, Shao Xuelin, and Pan Bingchen as representatives of the association to be responsible for handling all internal and external matters. (4) Issue a declaration. (5) Schedule a date to go to Beijing to petition. (6) Post advertisements to notify voucher holders in other cities to join the registration. (7) Schedule a date to entertain the press. (8) Zhou Bore was commissioned to draft the presentation and letters. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Hall Order for Requesting the Promulgation of the Land Tax Law <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Should not be discussed</p>
<p>Recently, the Jiangsu Department of Finance received a report from Qin Xitian, Director of the Shanghai County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, and Shen Zhou, Deputy Director, requesting that the grain tax be temporarily paid with an additional two yuan. They requested that the land tax law be promulgated as soon as possible to promote the political system and relieve the people of Su. After the department reported, it has already instructed the Shanghai County Government to the effect that the collection of grain conversion is originally to offset the shortage of the provincial budget and has long been approved by the Provincial Government Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. This grain price is based on the premise of expensive grain prices. If the harvest is repeatedly abundant and the grain prices are low, the provincial treasury is also more abundant and can be reduced. It is impossible to predetermine the collection period. The promulgation of the land tax law is of course important, but this matter is important and cannot be done hastily. It is now urging all counties to rush to register land and report debts as a preparation for land survey. As soon as it is completed, it can be discussed and drafted, but it cannot be revised immediately. The request to promulgate the land tax law should not be discussed, etc. Therefore, County Magistrate Yan has already sent letters to the Funds and Property Office and the Finance Bureau separately to comply.</p>

<p>Latvia's establishment of a consulate in Shanghai is not allowed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Latvia intends to establish a consulate in Shanghai due to business relations, and the candidate for the consul has also been internally determined to be Longsen. Chen, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was notified by letter. After receiving the letter, he reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was heard that the office received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday that because the country had not signed a commercial treaty with the National Government, the consul sent was not suitable to be received.</p>

It is heard that a formal meeting will be held soon.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Petition to the Central Government from the Jiangxi Provincial Association <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Enumerating Six Matters</p>
<p>The representatives of the Jiangxi Sojourners Association in Shanghai who petitioned the Kuomintang National Government during the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing, presented the following petition: We humbly implore the dispatch of a high-ranking military officer to personally oversee the suppression of the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province, and present our humble views on post-disaster management to alleviate the suffering of the people. We note that the communist bandit scourge in Jiangxi has lasted for over three years, and its impact has been felt in over seventy counties. The loss of life and property is incalculable, and the dire situation has been repeatedly reported, and presumably noted by the authorities. However, in light of past failures and current shortcomings, we propose a post-disaster management plan and have publicly elected five members of our association, namely Zeng, Wu, Yun, He Erfei, Qian Pinsong, and Rao Junqi, as representatives to respectfully present our case to your esteemed departments. (1) We request that Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally oversee the bandit suppression efforts. The communist bandits in Jiangxi Province should be easily eliminated. However, due to the incompetence and negligence of the provincial authorities and military commanders, the disaster has persisted. Although additional troops have been dispatched to assist in the suppression, deep-seated problems remain. There is excessive demarcation of responsibilities, as evidenced by Commander Liu Zhi's report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stating that "this side and that side" cannot coordinate their suppression efforts. Therefore, despite the large concentration of troops, lost territories have not been recovered. This is why the Jiangxi sojourners in Hankou and other places have all requested that Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally oversee the suppression efforts. Our association shares the same view. Even if this request cannot be granted, we urge the swift appointment of either He, the overall commander of the Jiangxi bandit suppression, or one of the two division commanders, Liu Zhi and Xiong Shi, to be stationed in Jiangxi Province and given a deadline to eliminate the bandits. This would ensure unified command and clear accountability. (2) We request the swift implementation of an encirclement and suppression plan. Historically, the most effective method for dealing with roving bandits has been encirclement and suppression. This was the case with the suppression of bandits during the Qing Dynasty, the suppression of Bai Lang, and even the previous joint suppression of the communist bandits in Jinggangshan. Otherwise, the bandits will simply move around as the troops pursue them, wasting military resources and harming the people. The method of suppressing bandits by dividing the area is akin to treating a headache by only treating the head or pain, leading to many problems and should not be used. Only a simultaneous encirclement by Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi can ensure that there will be no day for complete eradication. (3) We request the establishment of a special supply depot to unify the provision of supplies and strictly prohibit the establishment of separate lists and arbitrary exactions. The cost of bandit suppression is undoubtedly significant. If a special supply depot is not established to unify the provision of supplies, it will be difficult to avoid situations where some units are well-supplied while others are lacking. This will fail to motivate the officers and achieve significant results. The national military expenditure is already provided by the national treasury, and there is no reason to impose additional levies on local areas outside of the allocated military budget. However, the Jiangxi provincial government constantly uses the threat of troop mutiny due to a lack of military pay as a means of coercing contributions under various pretexts. These exactions are not approved by the central government, and the people are not allowed to appeal. Moreover, the troops stationed in various areas freely extort money. Even the act of deploying troops has become a source of income. If the people request the suppression of bandits, they must pay a deployment fee. If they request that troops not be deployed, they must pay a non-deployment fee. Even if troops are deployed and the people are forced to flee with the army, they must still pay a protection fee. Other forms of extortion are commonplace. The people, already suffering from natural disasters, man-made calamities, and the oppression of capitalism, have been further devastated by communist bandit raids. They can no longer withstand such exploitation. Therefore, a strict order must be issued to prohibit troops from freely raising funds locally, as this would only create opportunities for the communist bandits. (4) We request the establishment of a post-disaster committee to supplement the government's efforts. In areas affected by communist bandits, it seems that everyone is a bandit. In reality, many are merely coerced followers. Killing them will only harden their resolve to become bandits and eliminate any hope for their rehabilitation. Moreover, what does the people's housing have to do with bandits? Destroying them will only demoralize society. Therefore, there is no need to question the authenticity of their banditry. It is only necessary to distinguish between the leaders and the followers and to differentiate between the treatment of people and property. To achieve this, it is necessary to appoint local respected gentry and virtuous party members to form a post-disaster committee to handle these matters. Otherwise, even if the bandit scourge is temporarily suppressed, military-related disasters will be difficult to avoid. (5) We request the implementation of the Baojia system to eliminate the source of bandits. The Baojia system has been abandoned and local autonomy has not been implemented, allowing the communist bandits to spread their propaganda. Now, after the bandit suppression, the military or county magistrates will enforce the clearing of the countryside, which, based on recent events in various areas, will only create opportunities for the military or county magistrates to abuse their power and extort wealth. Restoring the Baojia system, even if it does not bring great benefits, will not cause great harm. (6) We request the allocation of ten million in disaster relief bonds to aid the disaster-stricken people. The Jiangxi Province has been suffering for a long time, the affected area is vast, and the suffering is more severe than in any other province. Refugees are everywhere, waiting to be fed. Without significant relief funds, it will be difficult to alleviate their suffering. Since the central government has already ordered relief efforts for Hunan and other provinces, there should be no distinction between them. Therefore, we propose the allocation of ten million in disaster relief bonds to provide relief during the suppression efforts, and we request the reduction or exemption of land taxes, and at the very least, the elimination of exorbitant taxes and levies. The above six matters are the urgent requests of our association and the people of Jiangxi. We humbly implore your esteemed departments to understand our foolishness, sympathize with our poverty, and adopt our proposals to achieve their realization. We await your orders with utmost apprehension.</p>

<p>Japanese Shipping Company to Lay Off Employees: Due to the shipping industry's poor performance this year, the revenue of the Japanese Shipping Company is not enough to cover expenses. The head office has decided to lay off employees to save costs. Yesterday, the Shanghai branch received a telegram from the head office stating that, according to the resolution, the Shanghai branch should also reduce its staff by one-tenth. This matter is under consideration and is expected to be implemented by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Weihai Seeks to Open a Shipping Route; China Merchants Bureau Requests Subsidy: The China Merchants Bureau is requesting that the Ministry of Transportation allow the post office in Weihaiwei to forward mail carried by the bureau, following the example of the British government, and requesting an initial subsidy of 4,000 yuan. The matter has been approved by the ministry, which has consulted the Weihaiwei Reception Administration regarding the subsidy. Once the administration's response is received, the China Merchants Bureau will be notified. Therefore, the China Merchants Bureau must wait for the Weihaiwei Administration to approve the subsidy before opening the Weihaiwei shipping route.</p>
<p>Japanese Rice Shipped to Hankou: After a large shipment of Japanese rice arrived in Shanghai, the municipal authorities decided to prohibit rice merchants from purchasing it. The rice remains stored in Shanghai warehouses. Recently, Japanese merchants have proposed selling the rice in batches to the Yangtze River region. Shipments have already begun, with each batch consisting of four to five hundred bags, transported by Japanese ships.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Municipal Government to Survey Unauthorized Bank Construction; <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Wusong River Dredging Unlikely This Year</p>
<p>During the winter season when the water level of the Suzhou Creek is low, vessels become congested, often causing blockages that hinder commercial transport. Previously, the Construction Committee, responding to requests from various parties, decided to expedite dredging to facilitate water transport. The Construction Committee organized a special committee for dredging the Wusong River, with representatives from relevant parties and the Municipal Government. After several meetings, a dredging plan was drafted, dividing the river into eight sections. Funding for the dredging would be raised by the various counties. Regarding the engineering aspects, the Dredging Bureau has sufficient personnel, equipment, and funds, so the Construction Committee and the Municipal Government will supervise the work and order the Dredging Bureau to provide detailed dredging plans and budgets for the first section of the project (from Waibaidu Bridge to Yejidun). Since then, the Dredging Bureau has been actively preparing dredging equipment, drawings, and a large dredging vessel, which has been completed. All procedures are in place, awaiting approval from the National Government before work can begin. It is now reported that the Construction Committee has been discussing the matter with key figures in the National Government, as it is difficult to raise funds for dredging the entire river and the unauthorized construction of banks and docks by foreigners along the Suzhou Creek has not been resolved. Starting work immediately may lead to many disputes over sovereignty. Therefore, the plan submitted by the Dredging Bureau has not been approved and has been effectively shelved. It is now reported that the Municipal Port Authority is negotiating with the Public Works Department regarding the unauthorized construction of banks and has requested that the Municipal Government schedule a survey. It appears that dredging the Suzhou Creek is unlikely to be realized this year.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Industry Representatives Petition to Safeguard Trade Regulations: <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Representatives Scheduled to Return to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Associations who were dispatched to Nanjing to petition for the implementation of trade regulations, Zheng Chengqing, Luo Qinghua, Ye Jiaxing, Sun Mingqi, Sun Choucheng, Cheng Guichu, and Yuan Hongjun, arrived at the Central Hotel in Nanjing on the morning of the 19th. At 10:00 a.m., they petitioned various government agencies, first visiting the National Government, where they were received by Secretary Zhu Wenzhong, who agreed to accept the Shanghai merchants' petition. They then visited the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, where they were received by Director Zhang Yiou, who discussed the issue of trade regulations in detail. He stated that the ministry was currently studying the matter and would submit it to the ministry's meeting for discussion. He also said that the ministry paid close attention to trade regulations and would do its best to maintain them. The representatives were satisfied and left. In the afternoon, the representatives visited Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. It is reported that they will return to Shanghai by train today. The petition is as follows: We respectfully petition that the trade regulations passed by the National Industry and Commerce Conference, after being approved by the relevant government departments, should be uniformly observed by all members of the trade, whether or not they have joined the association, in order to maintain unity and benefit commerce. The powers granted to trade associations by the Trade Association Law promulgated by the National Government are to maintain and promote the common interests of the trade and to correct malpractices in business. The means of promoting public interest and correcting malpractices are the trade regulations formulated by the trade associations in accordance with the inherent good customs of the industry. However, these trade regulations must be observed by all members of the trade, both inside and outside the association, in order to be effective. Otherwise, members of the association will not only fulfill various social obligations but will also be subject to the trade regulations, while non-members will be able to act freely and disrupt order. Not only will non-members not want to join the association, but even members of the association will withdraw, resulting in the collapse of the association or its transformation into a mere formality. The absence of common principles in business will inevitably lead to disorganization and irreparable damage. Taking past experiences as examples, the encroachment of the silk, satin, blue cloth, foreign print, and dyeing industries on the business of the organized trade associations has rendered them mere formalities, and business disputes in the dyeing industry have increased daily with no hope of improvement. In addition, the dissolution of the phonograph case trade association due to the inability of trade regulations to bind non-members has led to the decline of a handicraft industry that imitates Western products and resists foreign goods. Furthermore, Du Rongtai's deliberate violation of the trade regulations of the Western-style flower board chair trade association, despite the government's desire to rectify the situation, has not been effectively sanctioned due to legal constraints, and remains an unresolved case. Other examples include shoddy workmanship, undermining commercial credibility, and disrupting the market, making industry improvement almost impossible. Fortunately, the National Industry and Commerce Conference has passed a resolution stating that the trade regulations, after being approved by the relevant government departments, must be uniformly observed by all members of the trade, whether or not they have joined the association. The associations should wait for the government's order and dare not make further requests. However, in view of the importance of trade regulations and the urgency of the situation, we have specially elected Qinghua, Sun Shouchang, Zheng Chengqing, Dong Jiayu, Ge Liangqing, Yuan Hongjun, Cheng Guichu, Mao Chuntuan, Zhuang Meiyun, and Sun Zhiqi as representatives to present our petition to the ministry. We humbly implore you to grant us an audience and swiftly adopt and implement our proposals in order to maintain unity and benefit commerce. We respectfully submit this petition to the Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong, from the Shanghai Municipal Coal Industry, Footwear Industry, Candle Industry, Shaoxing Wine Industry, Clothing Store Industry, Lacquer Industry, Jewelry Industry, Fur Industry, Face Powder Industry, Native Cloth Industry, Soybean and Rice Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Construction Factory Industry, Ready-made Clothing Industry, Flour Mill Industry, Hat Store Industry, Western Pigment Industry, Timber Industry, Indigo Dyeing Industry, Coarse Tea Industry, North-South Goods Exchange Industry, Fresh Medicine Industry, Noodle Restaurant Industry, Chinese Business Western Candle Industry, Soybean Flour and Cut Noodle Industry, Duck Slaughtering Industry, Sand Boat Industry, Flower Industry, Charcoal Industry, Arrowhead Industry, Noodle Restaurant Industry, Liang Shaojiu Industry, Gauze Shop Industry, Domestic Pigment and Sundries Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Securities Industry, Postal Industry, Restaurant Industry, Embroidery Industry, Laundry Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Tobacco Exchange Industry, Foreign Firm Tea Industry, Spring Chair Industry, Ice Factory Industry, Local Goods Industry, Biscuit and Candy Industry, Towel Industry, Shoe Leather Nail Industry, Fresh Meat Industry, Second-hand Flower Industry, Rickshaw Industry, Rice Sales Industry, Rice Milling Industry, Willow Ware Industry, Industry, Western-Style Bookbinding Industry, Woodworking Industry, Western-Style Wood Furniture Industry, Transportation Industry, Yarn Industry, Industry, Factory Industry, Egg Industry, Chinese Medicine Industry, New Medicine Industry, Ship Repair Industry, Knitting Industry, Department Store Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, Coal Stone Barge Industry, Material Bottle Industry, Wood Industry, Tea Industry, Chicken and Duck Industry, Fish Industry, Dry Tobacco Industry, Fresh Pig Industry, Ice Fresh Fish Industry, Industry, Chinese Business Grain Industry, Comb Industry, Pearl and Jade Industry, Pawnshop Industry, Foreign Print Cloth Dyeing Industry, Jade Manufacturing Industry, Ivory Ware Industry, Paint Industry, Number Industry, Local Wine Industry, Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry, Oil Mill Industry, Firecracker Industry, Explosion Industry, and other trade associations.</p>

<p>The accident occurred between Anting and Huangdu; Night trains in both directions were stopped. Around 10:50 last night, the 20th slow train (third and fourth class) from Nanjing to Shanghai derailed four fourth-class carriages at the 26-kilometer mark between Anting and Huangdu stations. It is reported that the cause was that some unknown person had removed a section of rail and the dog spikes. Due to the darkness, it was impossible to repair the damage, resulting in the accident. Some passengers and railway staff were reportedly injured. The night train from Shanghai to Nanjing was turned back to Shanghai from Nanxiang. The North Station is currently assembling medical, engineering, and train staff to send a rescue train to the scene of the accident. Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Director of Train Operations, is also going to the scene to investigate.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Achievements of the Nanhui Cotton Experiment Station <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Effects of Breeding Become Apparent Amidst Reports of Crop Failures This year, the cotton harvest season suffered from more than 20 days of incessant rain in late August and early September, causing cotton bolls to rot and leading to poor harvests in most areas. It is reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Experiment Station Nanhui Branch has completed its cotton harvest, with an average yield of 140 catties of seed cotton per mu and a maximum yield of 169 catties per mu. Local farmers' best yield is only 90 catties per mu. The station's ability to achieve these results is due to careful cultivation, meticulous management, and the obvious effect of breeding. The improved white-seed cotton bred by the station has strong, robust, high-yielding, and long-staple characteristics. Among the households that received seeds this year, Cai Xueqin planted 17 mu and harvested a total of 2,044 catties of seed cotton, with an average yield of 120 catties per mu. Hong Yun of Yongding Temple planted 6 mu and averaged 119 catties per mu. Xia Jinsheng planted 10 mu and averaged 110 catties per mu, which is also better than neighboring farms. The cotton bolls on the cotton plants are visibly different from those in neighboring fields. Therefore, farmers generally feel that the station's cotton seeds are excellent and believe that the breeding is successful. In order to strictly control seed distribution, the station charges a seed price of three yuan per dan of cotton seeds. Recently, the cotton seeds have not yet been ginned, but all the cotton seeds have already been pre-ordered, which shows the farmers' deep faith in the station.</p>

It has been trying to raise emergency relief funds to assist in rescue efforts. It is now understood that winter is approaching and the area is in a cold zone, so the victims are in need of warm clothes. The Red Cross is especially dispatching Tai'an Branch President Li Zhenbang with 1,000 cotton-padded clothes and 200 cotton quilts, which were transported by Haidao on the Lianxing steamer to Liaoning. The Liaoning branch will work with other local branches to confirm and distribute the goods to the victims so that they can survive the harsh winter.

<p>The Dongjiadu Fire Brigade in the South City holds orchid and chrysanthemum exhibitions every spring and winter, inviting people from all walks of life to visit. This year, the association is holding a chrysanthemum show, with members collecting many valuable varieties, totaling more than 500 species, of which more than 300 are special varieties, including some from Yangzhou. They are all displayed in the association. Yesterday, the association invited people to appreciate the flowers. A banquet was also prepared, and more than 100 guests were present, warmly received by members such as Fang Peiqing. The association currently has six fire engines, one of which is the largest and can hold 14 belts, making it the best in Shanghai. Even the fire engines in the Public Concession are no match for it. The staff is also very enthusiastic about public welfare. In the past, the association did not have a dedicated budget and was funded by donations from members. Now, the Municipal Government provides an expenditure of 300 yuan per month, which is still insufficient.</p>

<p>In order to promote public health, the Municipal Health Bureau formulated "Regulations for the Management of Private Cemeteries" some time ago and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is understood that the Municipal Government believes that there are already many private cemeteries in the city, and their internal equipment and construction are indeed greatly related to public health. Moreover, since the regulations are based on the Cemetery Ordinance, they are necessary. The Municipal Government approved and promulgated the regulations yesterday. The regulations are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Management of Private Cemeteries (Promulgated on November of the 19th Year) Article 1: The establishment of cemeteries in this city shall comply with the Cemetery Ordinance and these regulations. Article 2: When preparing to establish a private cemetery, the operator should first submit a detailed map of the selected location along with a detailed plan to the Health Bureau for approval, and then apply to the Public Works Bureau for a building permit before starting construction. Article 3: After obtaining a building permit, a private cemetery shall apply to the Health Bureau for registration and issuance of a license. Cemeteries established before the promulgation of these regulations shall apply for registration within two months after the promulgation of these regulations. Article 4: The land occupied by each grave in a private cemetery shall not exceed two meters in length, two meters in width, and the surrounding fence shall not exceed meters in height. The depth of each burial pit shall be at least meters, with the coffin buried at least half a meter above the ground. Article 5: The maximum land price for each grave in a private cemetery shall not exceed one hundred yuan. Article 6: Private cemeteries shall provide free burial plots, not less than one-twentieth of the number of paid burial plots. Article 7: Private cemeteries may handle coffin transportation, pit digging, tomb construction, and tombstone erection for users, but standard prices should be specified in advance, and no additional charges may be requested afterward. If the user hires workers to handle the above matters themselves, the operator shall not force the user to have the cemetery handle it, unless it obstructs the architectural style stipulated by the cemetery. Article 8: The temporary mortuary attached to a private cemetery shall not exceed three rooms, and each room shall not hold more than five coffins, and each coffin shall not be stored for more than thirty days. If the number of rooms or coffins exceeds the regulations, a fine of fifty yuan will be imposed for each room or coffin, and the excess rooms shall be demolished or altered, and the excess coffins shall be buried. Article 9: Private cemeteries shall establish a maintenance fund and must have workers specifically assigned to guard the tombs, sweep the cemetery, and cultivate flowers and plants. Article 10: The operator of a private cemetery shall number the graves and report the name, origin, age, occupation, cause of death, and burial date of the newly buried person to the Health Bureau on a monthly basis for record-keeping, and submit a complete register at the end of each year. Article 11: Private cemeteries shall be subject to the supervision of the Health Bureau and shall promptly improve matters related to health in accordance with instructions. Article 12: If a private cemetery violates the Cemetery Ordinance or these regulations, the Health Bureau shall, according to the circumstances, give a warning to the operator or responsible manager or impose a fine of up to one hundred yuan.

<p>The Local Produce Trade Association yesterday sent a letter to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and the Zhabei Water Patrol Team, requesting them to send police to stop the harassment of merchants by vagrants at Caojiadu, the illegal interception of goods, and forced sales. The original letter is transcribed below for your information: Respected Sirs, Our association has received reports from various members, who in turn received reports from merchants from western villages, stating that they used boats to transport goods to Shanghai, hoping to entrust them to our member firms for sale. However, when passing through Caojiadu, they were hailed by many people resembling vagrants on the shore, who ordered them to stop, or they would be hit by bricks and stones. To avoid danger, they had to stop the boats. Unexpectedly, without the consent of the owners, these vagrants forcibly unloaded the goods and sold them to firms there at arbitrary prices, regardless of the cost of the goods, and ordered the merchants to return to their villages, preventing them from reaching our member firms, resulting in significant losses. We request you to find a way to provide relief. Previously, a merchant named Gao Mingxing and others transported goods from Jiaxing to Shanghai and were forcibly intercepted and sold by biased individuals from Xinshun Firm in Caojiadu. The merchant reported the case to your bureau, and the individuals were arrested and sent to court for legal action. Merchants have the right to choose which firm to entrust with the sale of their goods. How can they be intercepted halfway? This is happening in the Chinese area. What kind of system is this? When merchants refuse to comply with their orders, they are hit by bricks and stones, endangering their lives. This is extremely dangerous. To protect merchants, we hereby request your bureau to promptly dispatch police to investigate and punish such incidents severely to deter others and reassure merchants. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Sixth District Office, Zhabei Water Patrol Team, Shanghai Municipal Local Produce Trade Association.</p>

<p>The French Water and Electricity Workers' Union held a general meeting of group leaders yesterday. Renjun was elected as chairman and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the term of the third executive committee of the union has expired and has been overdue for several months. However, due to various circumstances, the reorganization could not be carried out as scheduled. Now that things are gradually settled, the reorganization has begun. The preliminary election of delegates has been largely completed, so the results will be announced today and a delegates' congress will be convened to hold formal elections. Two people from the mechanical department and two people from the personnel department were nominated as vote counters. More than 80 delegates were elected from over 1,000 votes.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Jianghai Customs Seizes Another One Million Yuan Worth of Opium <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Twenty Loads of Red Soil Shipped from Europe to Dalian</p>
<p>The Smugglers Arrived in Shanghai on a German Ship and are Japanese</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has repeatedly reported the seizure of large quantities of heroin. Yesterday morning, from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., seven officers from the Jianghai Customs Field Operations Team seized one hundred boxes of opium weighing 19,400 pounds (120 dan) worth one million yuan on the German cargo ship CLAUSE at a wharf next to the China Merchants Bureau's Chinese Warehouse in Pudong. The case was immediately reported to the Customs Commissioner, who ordered the opium to be transported and escorted to the Jianghai Customs Transfer Room for temporary storage and scheduled incineration. The smuggling and discovery of this large quantity of opium were quite tortuous, and it can be inferred from the seized confidential letters that the smuggling operation was large-scale and long-term, with considerable profits. The German cargo ship CLAUSE came from Europe, with Shanghai as its final destination in the Far East. In addition to the seized 120 dan of opium, it also carried a large number of other goods. The shipowner originally planned to unload all the goods and store them in warehouses. The Customs Field Operations Team immediately inspected them in accordance with regulations and found that the number of goods did not match the manifest. There were one hundred boxes of goods not listed on the manifest. At that time, the customs officers did not know that the one hundred boxes of goods were opium worth one million yuan. After inspection, it was discovered that a large quantity of opium had been smuggled into Shanghai. The Customs Commissioner was notified and questioned the shipowner. The shipowner then submitted a confidential letter related to the opium to the Customs Commissioner. After studying the phrases in the letter, it was learned that the smugglers were Japanese and that the opium came from Europe. The letter instructed that it be shipped to Dalian and then transferred to Guangdong, only with the name OLD SMOKER, and no real name specified. It was secretly transported to Shanghai by a German ship and planned to be transferred to a ship for smuggling to Dalian. Unexpectedly, it was seized in Pudong yesterday morning. It can be said that the net of heaven is wide, though its mesh is coarse, it lets nothing through.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Xin Case Support Association Held an Important Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Dingxiang Incident Support Association, formed by local organizations, labor unions, and hometown associations, held an important meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. Representatives from the Postal Workers' Union, the French Water and Electricity Workers' Union, the Seamen's Union, the Commercial Workers' Union, the Sino-Foreign Textile Workers' Union, the British-American Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, the Citizens' Federation, the British Shanghai Fire Brigade Workers' Union, the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, the Steamship Timber Workers' Union, and the Shanghai Hometown Associations of various regions, including Qian Liqun, Mu Zixiang, Zhang Shenzhi, and Zhao Kuiyi from the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, and dozens of others were present. Mu Zixiang was elected chairman and presided over the meeting. The chairman first reported that the Xin case occurred 36 days ago and has been actively assisted by various organizations. It has been reported that the French Consul sent a letter to the Municipal Government stating that the French sailors who caused the incident have been severely punished, but there has been no news of how they were punished. In the French Consul's letter, we know that the murderer who drowned Xin Dingxiang has been identified and there is now a correct basis in law. We should actively support it as a diplomatic backing to achieve the final victory. The results of the investigation of the Xin case by Ningbo lawyers were reported. It was then resolved: (1) Secret (2) To submit a serious protest to the French authorities through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ningbo Fellow Association will draft the petition. (3) Omitted (4) To publish a special issue on the Xin case, organized by Comrade Cheng Zhiliang (5) All labor unions should continue to issue declarations automatically (6) To ask various newspapers and opinion organizations to publish more articles on the Xin case and expand publicity. Other matters are secret and the petition to the Municipal Government and the Ningbo lawyers' investigation report are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Xin Case Support Association's Petition to the Municipal Government: Regarding the case of Sampan rower Xin Dingxiang being brutally beaten and thrown into the river by sailors of the French warship Valdek-Shah after demanding payment for crossing the river to Pudong, we request that you make serious representations to the French authorities based on reason to uphold national dignity and protect the lives of the people. Imperialists rely on unequal treaties as a talisman to exercise gunboat diplomacy, arbitrarily infringe on our sovereignty, insult our national dignity, and massacre our people. Tragic cases occur one after another. In particular, the occurrence of the Xin case has caused public sentiment to be very resentful. However, the French authorities still have no sincerity in resolving it. According to reports, Consul General Gange Lin has replied to your government, stating that the perpetrators have been severely punished by the French Navy and that all losses to the family of the deceased will be compensated. Although the French authorities have stated that they have severely detained the perpetrators, they have not announced which sailor was punished, what his name is, or which article of the country's law was used for the punishment. Our association believes that without the strength of the government and the support of the people to make a serious representation to the French authorities, it will be difficult to appease public anger and achieve the purpose. Therefore, the fourth standing committee meeting of our association resolved to have eight demands for fundamental and symptomatic treatment. In addition to submitting the fundamental demands directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the symptomatic demands are: (1) The French authorities should formally apologize to our government and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future (2) Punish the original murderer (3) Compensate Xin Dingxiang's family with 100,000 taels of silver for living expenses (4) Provide Xin Dingxiang with 30,000 taels of silver for funeral expenses. We urge you to take the spirit of the revolution and make serious representations to the French authorities with ten conditions to achieve the purpose of maintaining national dignity and preventing future troubles. We are extremely anxious and await your orders. Sincerely, Xin Dingxiang Incident Support Association of All Circles in Shanghai, respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Ningbo Lawyers' Investigation Report: After investigating the facts of this case, the undersigned convened a meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association on November 2 this year to question Zhu Gensheng, Ge Amao, and Xin Hesheng, the father of the deceased, who witnessed the incident. They claimed that at 6:05 a.m. on October 16 this year, two French sailors whose names were unknown took rickshaws to the Weituoma Road wharf and took Xin Dingxiang's Sampan to the French "Nasha" (transliteration) merchant ship. They did not pay the fare and went on board the ship. Xin Dingxiang waited beside the ship. At about 7:00 a.m., the two sailors and three sailors from the merchant ship came down the ladder. The three sailors went first, followed by the two sailors. The three sailors crossed Xin Dingxiang's Sampan to Ge Amao's Sampan chartered by the French Far East Shipping Company. One of the sailors immediately followed, and another sailor also wanted to cross over. At that time, Xin Dingxiang stood at the bow of his boat and urgently asked him for the fare. Unexpectedly, he angered the sailor, who punched and kicked him, pushing Xin Dingxiang into the river. At the same time, Sampan rower Zhu Gensheng, who was moored next to the Nasha ship, witnessed this situation and tried to rescue him, but after waiting for half an hour, he did not see Xin Dingxiang float up and had to return his Sampan to the wharf. The three sailors and one sailor in Ge Amao's Sampan saw Xin Dingxiang being beaten and pushed into the river by their companion and feared being implicated if they went ashore, so they asked Ge Amao to row back to the Nasha ship. Ge Amao was rowing the boat when Xin Dingxiang was being beaten by the sailor, so he was facing away from Xin's boat, but he heard the sound and when he turned around, he did not see Dingxiang, knowing that a disaster had occurred. After the sailors boarded the ship, he saw that Dingxiang's Sampan was still floating, so he took the Sampan and tied it to a barge and reported it to his father, Xin Hesheng. Xin Hesheng was shocked to hear the news and went to the Weituoma Road wharf to inquire. At that time, the two sailors were trying to avoid disaster and hired another Sampan to row to the Xiantuoma Road wharf, intending to escape. One sailor saw a group of boatmen standing and waiting on the wharf and, fearing that there would be trouble, jumped ashore before the boat docked. The boatmen bravely stepped forward and subdued him. The sailor dared to strike wildly with his belt. Fortunately, the crowd ignored the danger and firmly subdued him. The 415 Indian police patrol arrived and handed him over to the Indian police, who transferred him to the police station, but he was privately released. Another sailor fell behind and was also subdued by the boatmen and sent to the water police station. After questioning the witness Ge Amao and others, the sailor was still privately released and a small steamship was sent to escort him to the Huishan wharf to disembark. On October 21, Xin Dingxiang's body floated to the surface. The prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court verified that he had drowned to death during his lifetime. The French Concession Lujiawan police station summoned Xin Hesheng twice on October 24 and 28, demanding a settlement. The first time, a Western police officer gave him one hundred yuan, but he refused to accept it, saying that he had to ask his daughter-in-law. The water police station also summoned Xin Hesheng on October 30. A Western police officer's words contained intimidation. These facts were jointly investigated by the undersigned. Two French sailors should have paid Xin Dingxiang the fare, but they refused to pay it first. Xin Dingxiang stood at the bow of the Sampan. If he was pushed, there was a clear possibility of drowning. Anyone could recognize the danger of the outcome. The French sailor pushed him recklessly, causing Xin Dingxiang to drown and die. His actions are suspected of intentional homicide. As for the 415 Indian police and the water police station arbitrarily releasing the above-mentioned French sailors suspected of homicide without directly prosecuting them according to law, they are also suspected of dereliction of duty. The matter concerns national rights and the lives of the people. We dare to report the results of our investigation. Investigators: Lawyers Wei Jiong, Dai Chengxiang, Hu Feng, Lian Hu Xilian, Chen Zijuan, Liu Cailiang, Zhang Henghai, Zhou Hui, Yu Hualong, Hu Yongde, Wang Jianfan, Yuan Jiahong, Dai Jinghuai, Feng Kan.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Sea Bandits Fight Fiercely Outside the Wusong Estuary <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Bandit Ships Everywhere on the Sea</p>
<p>Merchant Ships and Boats are Robbed</p>
<p>Pan Kaiwu, the leader of the sea bandits, and Shen Gongxi, another leader of the sea bandits, engaged in internal strife and failed to reach a peace agreement in the waters off Wusong Estuary, Fengli, and Juegang, resulting in mutual attacks. Details have been reported in this newspaper. According to yesterday's news, after two fierce artillery battles between Pan and Shen, both sides suffered significant losses. However, because the strength of the two gangs of sea bandits is similar, neither side has retreated. In the past two or three days, the situation has escalated from positional warfare to mixed warfare. After Shen Guanxi's gang of sea bandits was driven back from Shayugang by Pan's gang, they learned that Pan's gang's base camp, Lvsi Sanjia Town, had been emptied of bandits and was weak. Therefore, Shen Guanshou led the bandit ships to resist Pan's bandits on one side, while Shen Guanxi personally led more than 40 bandit ships to the outer sea. They sailed to the Lvsi sea area the day before yesterday and intercepted Pan's gang. They were completely unprepared and suffered heavy casualties. The Shen bandits occupied Pengjia Tao in that sea area and seized more than ten bandit ships from Pan's side. More than one hundred defeated bandits from Pan's gang planned to escape back to Sanjia Town, but were blocked by patrol boats from the Fourth District and Eighteenth Team of the Wusong Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team and the Nantong County Public Security Team. Because the base camp had been lost, they scattered. At the same time, the Shen bandits in the Juegang and Fengli sea areas were attacked by Pan's gang and suffered significant losses. There was also news that Shen Guan had been killed by Pan's bandits. Later, Pan's gang heard that the base camp had been lost and immediately led dozens of bandit ships back to fight Shen's bandits fiercely. According to the situation a few days ago, almost every sea area outside the Wusong Estuary was occupied by sea bandits, and the chaos was extreme. Most of the merchant ships entering and leaving the port were robbed. The ships that reported incidents at the port in the past two days included the Ningbo Liu Gang ship Zhao Xiangxing, the sand barge Xin Deli, Chen Shunxing, Yang Taimao, Jin Yongxing, Jin Baoxing, Ni Shunmao, and others. There were still many unreported. Therefore, most of the sand fishing boats for export, seeing the danger of navigation, did not dare to sail alone. The Wusong Water Police's 17th and 18th teams have dispatched Zhenhai and Qinghai gunboats to sweep the waters outside the port.</p>

<p>Questioning of Ji and Xia</p>
<p>Vigorous Arrests of Fugitives Still in Progress</p>
<p>The assassination of Zhao Tieqiao, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau in Shanghai, by thugs, has been repeatedly ordered by various agencies, and rewards have been offered for their arrest. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team managed to obtain clues and, after many investigations, arrested the main culprit, Wang Jinshan, also known as Wang Ganting, nicknamed Wang Xiaolaosan. Wang Jinshan confessed that in a certain month, he was instructed by someone to open a room on the second floor of the Dalu Hotel in the French Concession to secretly plan an assassination, inviting accomplices to participate. At the time, he distributed box guns and six-round revolvers to Xia Guangyao (i.e., Xia Shaoen) and three others, who went to the entrance of the China Merchants Bureau to wait for Zhao's car to arrive. Xia Guangyao and others simultaneously opened fire, hitting Zhao, causing his death. Afterward, he received one thousand yuan, which he distributed to the others, and recovered the firearms. Recently, Director Shen of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau followed a lead to Xiajiacun in Hefei County, Anhui Province, and arrested Xia Shaoen and escorted him back to Shanghai. On the morning of the 19th of this month, Director Shen of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau personally brought the arrested Xia Shaoen to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to confront Wang Jinshan in court. Xia Shaoen confessed that he was invited by Wang Jinshan to a certain place in the French Concession to plan the assassination. At the time, Wang Jinshan issued him a six-round revolver. Wang Jinshan also carried a handgun and rode a bicycle to guide him and three others to the entrance of the China Merchants Bureau to wait for Zhao to get out of the car and opened fire to assassinate him. Afterward, Wang Jinshan gave him one hundred yuan and recovered the handgun. He admitted to the charges. Wang Jinshan's confession confirmed the details. The investigation revealed that there were four accomplices in this case. Wang Jinshan, the principal culprit who conspired, incited, and directed the assassination, and Xia Shaoen, the main culprit who opened fire, have been successively arrested and interrogated. It has been verified that Xia Shaoen was carrying a six-round revolver, which is consistent with the hospital's examination that Zhao was shot with a lead bullet. The facts of the case are clear. The authorities are urging a thorough and strict investigation of the remaining fugitives, and it is believed that the remaining fugitives will soon be arrested.</p>

<p>French Company Approves the Bus Route</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau Approves the Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Route 3 (Yuan Road North Section) has been operating since mid-January this year, running from Xiaodongmen to Laoximen in the uptown direction and from Laoximen via Laobeimen and Xinbeimen to Xiaodongmen in the downtown direction. Because the part of the route passing through Minguo Road in the French Concession must be agreed upon by the French company that also operates public buses in the French Concession, it has been delayed. It is reported that the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau has instructed the Shanghai South Company to negotiate with the French company. The two parties have signed a contract and the route will be open to traffic soon. It is reported that the fare has also been approved by the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Another Telegram of Support for the Xiao Case <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Qiaolianhui (Overseas Chinese Federation) et al. to the Fujian Provincial Government</p>
<p>Regarding the Xiamen Authorities Prohibiting the Arrival of Java Steamships</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Promotion Association, Seamen's General Union, Shanghai Women's Association, and other groups yesterday telegraphed to Chairman Yang and all members of the Fujian Provincial Government, stating: "Reports state that the Xiamen Garrison Commander has presented a request approved by the Provincial Government to suppress (boycott Java steamships). Based on your government's usual words and deeds, our association and others deeply believe that the reports are inaccurate. The current anti-Dutch movement was sparked by the defilement of female teacher Xiao Xin'an, which stems from the abuse of our overseas Chinese compatriots over the years. During the early Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Dutch soldiers cruelly massacred over ten thousand overseas Chinese. The Manchu rulers, intent on suppressing the Han, sat idly by without intervening, allowing the Dutch to become increasingly reckless. Throughout the Qing Dynasty, countless innocent overseas Chinese were killed. Since the Republic of China era, in various ports such as (Lassen), (Yingli), (Jukang), (Shengwa), (Wentongan), (Ganmenghua), (Gudusi), (Taiyang), (Wanlidong), and (Sanfapo), overseas Chinese have either been harmed by indigenous people or massacred by Dutch soldiers. Not a single life has been vindicated, and not a single case has been compensated. Conversely, the Dutch in our country are always protected by local officials, and any bullying or harassment must be severely punished according to the law. Why are others valued while we are demeaned? Anyone with nationalistic sentiments cannot but feel deeply resentful. But it is a heavenly principle that all humans are equal, while the Dutch despise the Chinese. Article 109 of the regulations in the Dutch colonies clearly stipulates that Chinese people are an inferior race, classified with local indigenous people, Arabs, Africans, Muslims, or polytheists, and are governed by special inferior laws. Japanese and all Europeans are a superior race, classified with the Dutch and receiving special respect from the Dutch government. In social interactions and prison treatment, Chinese people are not equal to Westerners. Even your esteemed persons, whom our association and others respect, and other military and political leaders are regarded as an inferior race in the eyes of the Dutch because Article 109 of the Dutch colonial regulations does not have a provision stating (but Chinese military and political authorities are not subject to this). The entire area of the Netherlands is only over twelve thousand square miles, less than three percent of our country. The population is only over five million, about 1.4 percent of our country. They are not worthy of being imperialists. However, the Dutch are peaceful and submissive towards Japan, while they are cruel and arrogant towards China. They especially regard our KMT (Nationalist Party), which saves the world and the country, as enemies. During the late Qing Dynasty, Qiu Xiating of Batavia secretly invited our Premier to Batavia, but the Dutch refused to allow him to disembark. This is what our Premier regretted the most, and what our party members should forever remember. The Northern Expedition of the righteous army unified the country, and our international status should have increased. However, the Dutch have intensified their contempt for our party and oppression. Schools are not allowed to hang the Premier's portrait, students are not allowed to read the Three Principles of the People textbooks, and no memorial weeks for the Premier can be held in any organizations. Documents and communications are not allowed to contain the phrases (Down with Imperialism) and (Abolish Unequal Treaties). Those who do not comply, whether they are executive committee members, supervisors, principals, or teachers, are arbitrarily detained and immediately deported. The Premier is the Premier of our country, the schools are the schools of our country, and the students are the students of our country. Why should they overstep their bounds and interfere? Their intentions are even more malicious than burning books and burying scholars. If we were to imitate them, how could foreigners tolerate it? The Dutch East Indies used to be subordinate to our country. Overseas Chinese have migrated there for over a thousand years, with over three million people residing there. When our people first went to the Dutch East Indies, there was no so-called entry tax. The entry tax was first levied in the first year of the Republic of China (1912) at twenty-five guilders per person. Then, due to successful collection, it was increased to fifty guilders. Since there was seemingly no protest, it was increased again to one hundred guilders. It is estimated that since the tax was first levied, overseas Chinese have paid approximately ten million yuan in this tax. Last year, the Dutch colonial council resolved to increase it again to one hundred and fifty guilders from July 1929. Lin Youren and other citizens residing in Beijing petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest, which resulted in a delay. In June of this year, the colonial council revived the old case and resolved to implement the increase of the entry tax to one hundred and fifty guilders per person from 1931. They also intend to retroactively collect an entry tax of seventy-five guilders per person for indentured laborers who have been tragically lured and sold. Conversely, those from the Dutch colonies who come to China are not charged a single cent. We treat the Dutch as the most favored nation, while they treat us as the lowest nation. How can we not feel resentful at such an act of repaying kindness with evil? Dutch officials of all ranks deliberately mistreat overseas Chinese. They arbitrarily levy taxes and abuse punishments on those who have already entered the country. Those who have just arrived at the port are often first detained in detention centers, and old customers are not allowed to provide legal guarantees at any time. Friends and relatives are not allowed to visit, and food is not allowed to be sent in, leaving them without food all day and without sleep all night. Since they cannot communicate in the language, they also lose their freedom of urination and defecation. Many weak women and children become ill and die as a result. The treatment is more severe than that of criminals. The strictness of the search leaves no one untouched, even women. Conversely, Japanese or Europeans arriving on the same ship are leisurely and comfortable, with no difficulty. Compared to this, how can we endure it? This accumulation of evil has aroused public outrage. Our association and others have invited various sectors to jointly launch a support Xiao and anti-Dutch conference. Those who have agreed to participate include the Chinese Vocational Education Society, Labor University, Lawyers Association, and over ten legal entities. The local municipal party headquarters has also replied with approval and will expand publicity through party organizations at all levels. The conference will declare support and various sectors will celebrate the Premier's birthday memorial. We are sending a telegram to the government requesting serious negotiations. The people's hearts are not dead, and the national spirit can be revived. As for anti-Dutch methods, boycotting the Java Steamship Company is the most effective. First, because the crew members of the company are the culprits who insult our nation. Without punishment, we cannot be human. Second, the decline of the company can attract the attention of the Dutch government, and the suffering of overseas Chinese can hopefully be improved. If we were to strike at the boycott movement, it would be tantamount to handing a weapon to the enemy and harming ourselves. The result of self-harm would harm the entire country, especially the people of Fujian. About two million overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies are from Fujian, and over ten thousand Fujianese overseas Chinese travel on Java steamships every year. Second, Xiao Xin'an must be a young lady from Fujian. Therefore, we urgently request your Excellency, for the sake of the party, the country, overseas Chinese, and our hometown, to immediately order Commander Lin of Xiamen to retract the order (suppressing the boycott of Java steamships) and to dismiss the magistrate of Siming County, who recklessly requested the suppression of the enemy movement. The people of the entire country will sing your praises without end. This pressing petition is presented with utmost trepidation, awaiting your command. Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Promotion Association, Seamen's General Union, Shanghai Women's Association, Taiwan Chinese General Hall, Shanghai Academy, Fujian Society, Yixing Society, Yixing Fellow Townsmen Support Group in Shanghai, respectfully bowing in unison."</p>

<h3 id="e183">Public Works Bureau Patrol Boat Rescues Cargo Ship in Huangpu River <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Preserving Cargo Worth Ten Thousand Gold</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM on the 18th, a Songjiang-bound boat (owned by Xue Yuesheng), bearing the license plate number 712335 for cargo ships in Shanghai, was fully loaded with general merchandise worth over ten thousand gold, heading from Shanghai to Songjiang. As it passed behind the Dongjiadu Wharf of the Dalae Company, a steamship sped by and failed to avoid it, resulting in a violent collision. The sound was heard by Gao Chao, an employee of the Public Works Bureau's Shipping Department at Dongjiadu. He immediately dispatched patrol boat number one, along with police officer Lou Tingyao and others, to provide assistance. By then, the Dalae steamship had already sailed far away. The cargo ship had a large hole in the rear hold on the left side, and water had already entered, causing it to sink. Small boats surrounded the ship, frantically grabbing cargo. Gao saw that the ship was stranded in the river and unable to dock on its own. He immediately ordered the boats to return the items they had taken and used the patrol boat to tow the ship to the Dongjiadu Wharf. Fortunately, the wind and waves were not strong, and both the people and the goods were preserved. It is said that in addition to employee Gao, police officer Lou Tingyao, the patrol boat captain, stoker, and sailors also contributed greatly. The bureau has already conveyed its praise to them.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Suspect in Kidnapping Case, Cao Zhigan, Interrogated Yesterday <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Awaiting Investigation and Clarification Before Review</p>
<p>A Jiangbei man surnamed Huang, who runs a steamed bun shop in Puanfang, Zhoujiazui Road, reported to the police after his four-year-old son, Jinlin, was kidnapped. It was found that Cao Zhigan from Yangzhou was involved in the case, and Cao was taken to the Special District Local Court. Cao denied being a bandit and claimed to work as a ticket collector at the Yangzhou Opera House on Jessfield Road. Judge Ge ordered further investigation and questioning. The investigating officers inquired at the opera house, and the owner, Deng Changfu, stated that there was no Cao Zhigan among the ticket collectors. It was also discovered that the bandit had committed six other robbery cases. Yesterday morning, witnesses were gathered, and Cao was taken to the court for further interrogation. Deng arrived in court and stated that the defendant was not his employee. Rickshaw puller Wei Hongsan testified that on October 6, at 5:00 PM, the defendant hired him to take him and a young child in a rickshaw to Caojiadu. However, recently, many people have come to his house and forbidden him from testifying in court. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he used to collect tickets at the Yangzhou Opera House, but because he was implicated in the kidnapping case, the owner denied it. Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody pending further investigation and review.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Sentencing of Repeat Robbery Offenders <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Theft gang members Yang Youfu, Kong Xiaojiang, Zhu Guisheng, Wang Jinsheng, Chen A'er, Zhang Fuxiang, Zhou Kaiquan, etc., successively robbed over ten households in the French Concession, including Xu Chuqing at 65 Rue Prudence, Shen Weizhi at 393 Route Ferguson, Wu Zhengqing at 1 Xihu Lane, Route Massenet, Su Dingsheng at 291 Rue Bayle, Sun Heyan at 1 Xinyili, Route Zikawei, Zhong Yunlong at 277 Yunzhenli, Route Lagrene, Bao Xiuqing at 38 Yangshunli, Route Zikawei, Hao Anfu at 42 Yuhang Street, Yang Jinggeng at 172 Route Massenet, Chen Lunsong at 48 Yuxing Street, Zhu Zhongshi at 23 Jianli, Avenue Edward VII, and Chen Shanfu at 441 Xiangxingli, Route Cardinal Mercier, dividing and spending the stolen clothing and valuables. Detectives Li Yousheng (chief detective), Zhou Ruiyuan (deputy detective), Liu Jinrong, Wu Lianrong, Cheng Yuming, Gao Xinfa, and Gu Jinsheng of the French Concession Police discovered that the bandits were hiding in the Laonanyang Inn on Mintiniyin Road. They immediately approached quietly and apprehended the seven robbers, along with accomplices Li Dexiang, Qin Xiaosan, and suspects Zhang Quanzhou, Li Shuangxi, Zhang Zhengyuan, and the female thief Ji Yushi. They confiscated two pistols and stolen goods, taking them to the police station for questioning. Yang and others confessed that the gang leader, Wei Xianshen, also known as Wei Sanzi, was hiding in Zhenjiang. The detectives went to Zhenjiang and, together with local officials, arrested Wei and brought him back to Shanghai. Yesterday, they were brought to the French Court for investigation. The plaintiffs first testified about the robberies. Chief Detective Sasaier reported that the gang leader Wei Xianshen was extremely ferocious, had many accomplices, and specialized in providing pistols to his accomplices for robberies, after which the pistols would be returned to him for division of the loot. The detectives were sent to Zhenjiang to arrest Wei, but his accomplices resented the Zhenjiang officials for guiding the arrest. That night, they assassinated the detective. Please impose severe punishment for such lawlessness. Wei Xianshen confessed to providing pistols to his accomplices for robberies and dividing the loot. Yang Youfu and the other seven confessed that they were all instructed by Wei Xianshen to commit robberies and that the pistols were provided by Wei. Zhang Quanzhou, Li Shuangxi, and Zhang Zhengyuan claimed that they were mistakenly arrested and did not participate in the robberies. Li Dexiang and Qin Xiaosan confessed to helping dispose of stolen goods, but did not know they were stolen. Ji Yushi confessed that she was involved with the fugitive Xu Heshang for only two months and did not know he was a thief. Please investigate. The French and Chinese judges sentenced Wei Xianshen, Yang Youfu, Kong Xiaojiang, Zhang Fuxiang, and Zhou Kaiquan to five years in the French prison, followed by deportation and transfer to mainland officials for further proceedings.

<p>A Friend's Advice Leads to Wishful Thinking</p>
<p>A Five-Year-Old Child Suffers</p>
<p>Du Runzhang, a Ningbo native residing at 138 Haining Road, Rehe Road, had his five-year-old son, Wenming, kidnapped near his home last month. On the afternoon of the 16th, Ye A'san suddenly went to Du's house and said that Wenming was currently being cared for by him. Du and his wife, Tang, followed Ye to his house at 982 Zhoushan Road and took their son back. They then reported the incident to the police station, and detectives Zhou Rongsheng and Liu Changsheng inquired with Ye. They learned that the kidnappers were hiding at 951 Zhoushan Road and arrested Wang Changfa, Zhu Helin, Xu Rongfu, and the woman Wang Zhangshi from Ningbo. Yesterday, they were taken to the Special District Local Court and interrogated by Judge Sun. Witness Ye A'san testified that on the 12th, Wang Changfa and Xu Rongfu brought the child to his house and asked to sell him. He bought him for forty-three yuan. Later, because the child cried all day, he inquired with Wang and others and learned that he had been kidnapped. He firmly ordered Wang Changfa to help him find the child's parents and report the incident to the police station. Wang Changfa confessed that he was a cook and had lost his job recently. He discussed with his friend Zhu Helin whether to sell his wife, but Zhu objected and said that it would be better to kidnap a child and sell him to make a living. On that day, he passed by the plaintiff's house and saw his son. He lured the child with copper coins and kidnapped him. Zhu then entrusted Xu Rongfu to sell the child to Ye's family. Zhu Helin admitted to being the mastermind. Xu confessed that he was entrusted by Zhu, and initially did not know that the child had been kidnapped. He received six yuan in commission. Wang Zhangshi claimed that she knew nothing. Judge Sun ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<p>Rescued Early, Likely to Recover</p>
<p>Yu Henian, a 25-year-old Wuxi native who previously worked at the Nanhua Printing Company at 7 Taopeng Road, opposite the Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, quit his job in September. Unable to return to his hometown, he stayed in Shanghai and spent all his money on food and lodging. Feeling unable to face his elders in his hometown, he became despondent and secretly bought a bottle of sleeping pills from a pharmacy, fearing that committing suicide in Shanghai would be a laughingstock to his friends. The day before yesterday, he took a train to Suzhou and stayed at a room in the First Inn outside Changmen. On the day of his arrival in Suzhou, he spent the whole day sightseeing and returned to the inn in the evening. After dinner, he closed the door tightly and wrote two suicide notes, one to his parents, stating that he should not have drifted around, which led to his unemployment and made him unable to return home, and the other to the inn's accounting office, detailing his origin and requesting that his father (named Yu Huizhong) be notified to collect his body in Suzhou. After writing the letters, he swallowed all the sleeping pills and went to bed. At 10:00 AM the next morning, the inn's tea house worker entered the room after Yu did not wake up and found him lying stiffly on the bed, his expression pale. Knowing that he had taken poison, he saw an empty bottle of sleeping pills and two suicide notes on the bed. He immediately notified the accounting office, who sent him to Suzhou Yong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he had taken only a small amount of poison and his life could be saved. The inn has sent a letter to Yu's father, Huizhong, in Wuxi to come to Suzhou and handle the matter, and has also sent a letter to the Nanhua Company to inquire about everything.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Preservation of Incense and Candle Industry <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating: "Regarding the request for consideration, we received a letter from the Incense and Candle Trade Association on the 19th, stating that they read a report on the 11th that the city's party and government authorities had resolved to promote the national calendar and to confiscate and fine shop owners, managers, and residents who sell goods such as incense, candles, and paper horses for Lunar New Year celebrations. The association pointed out that while the authorities' move to promote the national calendar is well-intentioned, the Lunar New Year falls at the end of February on the national calendar, close to Qingming Festival, when people typically purchase incense and candles to worship their ancestors. If the municipal authorities use the sale of these items as the standard for confiscation and punishment, people who purchase incense and candles to commemorate their ancestors may be mistakenly identified as celebrating the Lunar New Year. Police officers with clear orders will be able to interfere at will, and merchants will be unable to defend themselves, leading to financial losses and imprisonment. The sale of incense and candles will be greatly affected, and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of businesses will be threatened. Therefore, the association members unanimously requested a meeting to discuss ways to address the situation. It was resolved to actively inform the public to comply with the national calendar and to request that the municipal authorities instruct their departments to be lenient and make distinctions regarding citizens purchasing incense and candles for ancestor worship in February, so that they would not be wrongly accused of superstitious practices. The association members also pointed out that incense and candles are used for weddings, birthdays, memorials, and other occasions, and not just for Lunar New Year celebrations. Prohibiting the sale of these items during the entire month of the Lunar New Year would not only disrupt legitimate uses, but would also be equivalent to forcing incense and candle shops to close for the entire month, leading to significant losses. The association respectfully requests that your bureau review the situation and take appropriate action to benefit the public. Sincerely submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the New Medicine Trade Association, relaying a directive from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, approving a request from the Ministry of Health regarding the investigation and handling of cases related to the "Regulations for the Management of Patent Medicines." These regulations were promulgated and implemented on April 26th of this year and were separately communicated to various provinces and cities for compliance. Numerous drug merchants have reported that Article 5 of the regulations stipulates that various patent medicines sold before the implementation of these regulations must, within six months of their implementation, apply for re-inspection and obtain permits in accordance with Article 2. However, the procedures for amending drug package inserts, prescriptions, and printed materials are complex and time-consuming, making it impossible to complete them in a timely manner, and they requested an extension of the deadline. After careful verification by the Ministry, these claims were found to be valid. To address the difficulties faced by the merchants, it was approved that the original deadline in Article 5 of the regulations be extended for another six months, until April 26th, 1931, as a gesture of consideration. A report has been submitted and separate communications have been sent for review and instructions to ensure uniform compliance by all relevant parties.</p>

<p>Workers in the tinfoil section of the new British American Tobacco Company factory in Pudong went on strike on the 18th to protest the factory's unwarranted dismissal of twenty workers and the assault of worker No. 89 by foreman Pope, as well as the expulsion of other workers. Despite several rounds of negotiations between labor and management, the labor side demanded that the management pay severance pay to the dismissed workers, equivalent to six months' salary per worker, and dismiss foreman Pope. However, the factory authorities took a firm stance, resulting in no resolution. It is now learned that yesterday, Zhou Funong from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Wang Gang from the Social Affairs Bureau, along with labor union representatives Chen Peide, Gu Ruobe, Li Guangxian, and others, re-entered the factory for negotiations, indicating that the labor side had made concessions. Their demands were reduced to three: (1) Severance pay for the dismissed workers should be based on their years of service, with one month's salary for each year of service as the standard, and proportionally more for longer service. (2) Double the savings funds should be issued. (3) Foreman Pope should be dismissed. The factory did not agree to the above three demands, resulting in no resolution, and the negotiations broke down. Last night, the workers in that section gathered at the union to hold a meeting and resolved not to resume work until their demands were met and to appeal to higher authorities for a fair resolution.</p>

<p>Indeed, university students are "big" in everything—their knowledge, expenses, and even their eating habits. How can we prove this? We can use the eateries in front of the university gates as evidence.</p>
<p>Almost every university has a consumer cooperative, which naturally sells mostly food items. However, this is not enough; they also need external eateries to supplement their food supply. Their eating habits can also be divided into seasons—generally hot in winter and cold in summer, with no standard in spring and autumn. Confectionery is suitable for all seasons.</p>
<p>Regarding the price of food, it goes without saying that it is expensive. A medium-quality meal package costs eleven and a half yuan per month (for only two meals). A single pear or orange costs more than ten cents. On average, each person eats six times a day. The first time is breakfast, the second time is a snack at 10:00 AM, the third time is lunch, the fourth time is a snack at 4:00 PM, the fifth time is dinner, and the sixth time is a snack at 10:00 PM. This does not include fruits after lunch and dinner, and large dishes on Saturdays or Sundays.</p>
<p>In this way, expenses naturally increase greatly. It is truly too difficult when there is no money. If they don't eat, they can't get by, but if they eat, they have no money. Therefore, they come up with the ingenious method of keeping accounts. Small vendors are also very welcome because keeping accounts can increase business. By the end of the season, each person has to pay at least twenty or thirty yuan in account money.</p>
<p>There are also a few clever ones who have come up with a [method of free-loading]. This free-loading is not free-loading from classmates, but free-loading from the eateries. It is difficult to free-load from external eateries; the easiest is to free-load from the consumer cooperative because the consumer cooperative is run by the student union. How is this free-loading done? Most of the time, it involves not repaying the account or only repaying half of it. By the time the student union is reorganized the following year, the president has changed, and the old accounts are forgotten, so the free-loading is successful.</p>
<p>The consumer cooperative of C University, because there were too many people free-loading, came up with an ingenious method of [limiting the collection of accounts to certain dates and having the training department collect the unpaid accounts]. The training department is meant to train students, and students who do such immoral things naturally want to train him.</p>
<p>There are also a few even cleverer ones who think that keeping accounts is unstable and may still be collected, so they don't even keep accounts, free-loading openly. Recently, the consumer cooperative of C University posted a notice that reads:</p>
<p>[Mr. So-and-so, you often grace our cooperative at 9:00 AM, eating for free. We should announce your name, but we are temporarily keeping it secret out of consideration. We hope you will be cautious in the future.]</p>

<h3 id="e212">The Sea Adventures of American Sea Scouts <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>According to Mr. Quimby, the National Director of Sea Scouts in the United States, young people are now inclined towards maritime adventure and romance. This summer, there were five hundred Sea Scout-operated ships traveling between the coasts of the United States and various inland waterways. Last year, the number of Sea Scouts and their leaders throughout the United States increased to 9,800.</p>
<p>Sea Scout training in the Boy Scout movement provides older children with an opportunity for civic and moral training, and gives each Sea Scout the joy of maritime romance and adventure during navigation. Currently, there are 600 Sea Scout groups in 43 states in the United States, as well as Alaska, the Philippines, Hawaii, and Argentina. The Boy Scouts in Mexico and Cuba, which are not connected with the Boy Scouts in the United States, also have Sea Scout organizations. Their results are all quite good.</p>
<p>In the past few years, many children have obtained opportunities for adventure through the Sea Scout movement that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. Last year, the Chicago Sea Scout Corps, operating a small sailboat called the "Blue Moon," won the Mackinac Boat Race Championship, the longest and most difficult freshwater sailing race in the world. Sea Scout Paul Shephard, because he had sufficient Boy Scout training, obtained an opportunity to explore the Arctic with Admiral Byrd. David Martin, a Sea Scout from Austin, explored the Spanish seas with Duke von Luckner.</p>
<p>Since 1927, when the Chicago Sea Scout Corps operated the expedition ship "North Light" of the John Bowden Field Museum on a large-scale expedition to the Arctic, bringing back many museum specimens and scientific studies to Chicago, Sea Scouts have been committed to adventure. However, the adventure of these few Sea Scouts is not enough to represent the entire spirit of Sea Scouts. The value of Sea Scout training, in fact, is to give each Sea Scout an opportunity for adventure under perfect guidance, and to learn seamanship and the maritime changes of the country's history from perfect guidance based on their personal sailing interests.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the 600 Sea Scout groups in the United States have their own ships. These ships range from small 15-foot boats to 150-foot sailing ships. Boy Scout associations and various Sea Scout groups throughout the United States are equipped with such ships.</p>
<p>Among all the ships in the Sea Scout division of the Boy Scouts of America, many are of historical interest. The old "Argus" clipper, 79 feet long and weighing 38 tons, which the Washington Sea Scouts recently obtained, was formerly a training ship of the United States Naval Academy. The Sea Scouts of San Diego, California, own the old three-masted ship "Star of India," which won honors in the Alaska supply fleet. Speaking of the duration of time, the training ship "Naomi" of the Chicago Boy Scout Headquarters should be considered the oldest of the Sea Scout ships. All of the first Sea Scout leaders in the United States were trained on this ship. The New York City Sea Scouts have a 169-foot sailing ship called the "Princess Minas," which is now used as a racing yacht.</p>
<p>The Sea Scouts in two district areas are equipped with training sailing ships, one in New York and New Jersey, and the other in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. This summer, the Sea Scouts of New York and New Jersey sailed the 55-foot "Tya Stonehead" sailing ship around the sea. The Sea Scouts of the seventh district sailed a 103-foot sailing ship called "Bineta." These two ships sailed at sea for seven days, under the guidance of experienced leaders, allowing the children to learn the basics of sailing and how to operate a ship.</p>
<p>Many Sea Scouts have created their own reputation and anecdotes. Whether operating small boats or large ships, they often have a sincere spirit of service to the local country. Since the addition of the Sea Scout branch, the most notable service spirit among them is the Sea Scouts on the "Salasetai (Southern Cross)" ship. They did a lot of valuable work during the disaster in Florida in the past.</p>
<p>The Trenton Sea Scouts were recently honored to receive a motor speedboat donated by the Robertling family. This ship, called the "Brentley," is 65 feet long and has a Datsel-style engine, making it very outstanding in the Sea Scout fleet. The Sea Scouts of the Klemen township in Michigan have a ship converted from a submarine destroyer, 110 feet long. The Milwaukee Sea Scouts of Wisconsin have an 80-foot sailing ship called the "Captain Lawrence."</p>
<p>The development of Sea Scouts in the Midwest of the United States is very rapid. It seems that in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming, where aquatic activities are rarely mentioned, there are now also 25 Sea Scout troops with about 350 people. Their activities are mostly on the rivers and lakes of their hometowns. In some places where the waterways are too small, they use canoes instead of boats. In order to obtain the necessary knowledge of navigation, the Sea Scouts in this region sometimes sail in small boats to Chicago and the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>This year, two Sea Scout troops have participated in the "Robert Prince" competition, a total of 570 miles. Various sizes and types of ships can join. The voyage starts from Seattle, Washington, and goes straight to Robert Prince Island in Canada. Two Sea Scout troops participated in this competition, one from the Teai Boy Scouts of Seattle, Washington, and the other from the Sea Scouts of Takoma, Washington. During this competition, there were many old [hands] along the Pacific coast.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>Navigators participated in it. As a result, the Takoma Sea Scouts won one of the victories. Their caution in sailing won the first prize. At the beginning of this season, the junior and senior members of the Chicago Sea Scout Corps competed in small boat sailing with the junior and senior students of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. This competition was held in rough seas and the voyage was about one mile long. As a result, the championship of the senior Sea Scouts was taken by the senior sailors, but the junior Sea Scouts defeated the junior sailors.</p>
<p>The American Sea Scouts sailed to many places this year. The San Francisco Sea Scouts sailed on the Sacramento River. The Sea Scouts of the province sailed to New York. Some children came to this big city for the first time. The Trenton Sea Scouts took their new boat to Bangor, giving the members a lot of opportunities for adventure. The Washington Sea Scouts took the Chesapeake Bay to Norfolk, and some Boy Scouts traveled to various places by sea during the summer.</p>
<p>This year, the Chicago Sea Scouts still participated in the Mackinac Island race. This is the longest and most difficult freshwater race in the United States. Last year's championship was taken by a Sea Scout corps, although their ship was very small and had very little chance of winning. According to Mr. Quimby, the National Director of Sea Scouts, the story of the Sea Scouts winning the Mackinac Island race last year is very interesting in the history of the Boy Scout movement.</p>
<p>In 1920, the United States [first] had a Sea Scout organization. At that time, Mr. Quimby served as the Sea Scout instructor on the "Naomi," an old ship obtained by the newly established Chicago Sea Scouts. Mr. Quimby said, "At that time, there were 18 children on this old ship. They didn't know anything about sailing. When the Naomi set sail, some of my friends were driving the exquisite yachts of the yacht club. They laughed at us for teaching children to sail and implement Sea Scout training."</p>
<p>[Driving a ship is a funny thing and also helpless. That was seven years ago, and there were very few Sea Scouts in the country. Last year, when the Mackinac competition was held, the number of Sea Scouts and leaders in the United States reached 7,500, with about 400 ships. Every ship has experienced crew members who know how to drive a ship. The Chicago Sea Scouts have made very rapid progress. Many of the newly established groups have been helped by yacht clubs. These people were the ones who laughed at the Sea Scouts before. The "Blue Moon" ship had only five Sea Scouts at that time.]</p>
<p>[The year before the Mackinac competition was held, these Boy Scouts began to prepare everything. They had to plan carefully because there were many experienced sailors from the Midwest participating in this competition. The Sea Scouts carefully studied the past competition results. They calculated the course of each wind direction to avoid temporary mistakes on the day of the competition. These Boy Scouts unknowingly discovered that the wind in the previous competitions was mostly from the southeast, and this wind always started blowing at the end of the competition.]</p>
<p>[The day of the competition arrived, and a group of neatly dressed Sea Scouts set off on the "Blue Moon" ship with the crowd. A total of forty ships joined this competition. The Sea Scouts joined with their leaders for the first time. On the last day of the competition, everyone was heading to Schuyler's Island. This island is usually used as a turning point in the voyage, and the winner of the competition often takes the lead in this place. The Sea Scouts were lagging behind here, but they had calculated in advance that the wind would suddenly blow from the southeast. The sailors on other ships stopped and re-established their course. The veteran navigators took out their spinnakers, jibs, and fisherman's mizzen sails and happily moved forward quickly.]</p>
<p>[Suddenly, everyone was surprised. A ship flew forward, which had never happened in the competition. This was the ship that the Sea Scouts were riding. The children had already set a clever sailing plan. Their ship also carried a spinnaker, jib, and fisherman's mizzen sail hanging between the fore and aft masts. Because of their self-defined navigation method, the "Blue Moon" ship, representing the Sea Scout division of the Boy Scouts of America, won the championship.] Mr. Quimby said, "If you want to know more, then the members of the Chicago Yacht Club may tell you about the course of the "Blue Moon" winning the championship and the Sea Scout corps they now preside over."</p>
