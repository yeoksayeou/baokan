<h3>中華足球會賽眞茹全勝優游</h3>
<p>結十二對零中華足球會昨共有九組出塲、中字組之眞茹對優游、最饒興趣、優游多係宿星老將、當其骋馳、綠筒塲上、躍馬黃戈、顧影自豪、想往年爭雄奪覇之際、足球中、當有其無數偉大之戰跡、傳爲美談、今則精力漸喪、雄心未死、惟各盡所能、與人周旋、勝敗利纯非其所計耳、初次出馬、適逢强手眞茹、竟而損失十二球、宿星老將是喜是悲記者不得而知也、</p>
<p>（一）二隊陣線</p>
<p>眞茹隊江宗韾陳春秀江善敬戴麟經陳福忠楊保森曾榮忠雲逢霖陳家球羅海光章榮文陳鎭祥</p>
<p>優游隊陳劭張明璋沈柏貴葉晋錦陳吉祥毛鴻貴何伯鴻邵樂平史友惠胡有成張鍚恩王才高胡仁階</p>
<h3>（二）比賽經過</h3>
<p>眞茹賴其敏捷之身叚、堅强之體格、開始即予猛烈之攻擊、優游扼守要隘、相持不下、如是者十分鐘、眞茹得角球之機、一球中落、中鋒羅海光頭迎之、以頭球入網内、然而頭破血流、不克再戰、功成身退竟而下野、又十分鐘、眞茹第二次</p>
<p>角球、守門者誤擊人門、又十五分鐘、優游以前方占勢、全軍齊出、以致内防虚、陳家球輩槍匠馬打入陣來、守門陳劭孤掌掌難鳴、痛遭失守、最後陳又獲中一球、上半時眞茹四優游零、再戰聲中、優游人困馬乏、實力大减、眞茹如則生龍活虎、縱横自在、初尙苦戰十分鐘、不分勝負、厥</p>
<p>後如江河决口、一發不可收拾、任憑全軍分列區内、加意防衛、終難當對方精銳莫敝之侵略、後之三十五分鐘内、曾榮忠得一球、童榮文二球、戴麟經五球、共獲八球、結果眞茹以十二對零勝、裁判員何春輝、</p>

<h3>林寳華在津比賽獲勝</h3>
<p>單雙打均獲勝···擊敗天建冠軍大輪强（天津特訊）中國綱球明星林實華應天津網球界之邀請於九月底乘天津丸北上十月四日抵津天津網球會代表周景福陶視椿及天津網球冠軍大輪强等赴大連碼頭迎接、林君於下午六時登岸、下榻於樹德里三號枼君處於五六兩日即出場客身手總計單標林以六比三、七比五勝飛伯又以六比○六比一、五比七一比六、六比</p>
<p>三擊敗天津冠軍大輪强、雙打賽林與周景福合組以六比四、四比六、六交比一、六比四、八比六勝威脫莫亞與大輪强、茲將詳情錄下、</p>
<p>（一）雙打林寳華周景福六四六六八威脫莫亞大輪强林寳華對西人網球會之比賽於五日下午二時半在英球場舉行觀衆約二百人、多數爲西人網球會會員學生亦甚多、下午二時林氏即與周景福上場練習、雖以經歷風塵、但已有充分之休息故不十分頽靡、稍行練習、即由公證人司蜜斯君宣佈開球、於是林周對輪强與威脫莫亞之雙打遂開始矣、</p>
<p>第一盤第一局由林發球球出如矢、不愧名手、姿勢尤佳、足爲模範經數次强烈抽擊之結果而勝第一局、二局開始、林周查知敵隠、瞬間即造成五對三之成績、三局間林氏有反擊、點落極佳、龍乾奔返不及而致敗、末局亦快勝、結果第一盤林周以六比四勝、</p>
<p>第二盤開始後林周即佔上風、一氣連勝兩局、三四局稍見弱點、被輪强猛抽得勝、第五局林氏發球甚佳、敵方回球遇弱、致敗、但至六七八局時、周君擊球高而近網、因而連敗三局、終</p>
<p>於不可收拾、第二盤林周以六比四失敗、</p>
<p>第三盤二盤畢後、雙方又重整旗鼓、林鑒於二盤之失敗、乃用全力以爭、輪强因林氏之猛烈抽擊、以致雙足跳起、騰空防守、直使觀衆啞然失笑、輪强組僅勝第三局本盤結果、林周以六比一勝、</p>
<p>第四盤三盤賽畢、兩方皆至網球會惡息、略進茶點、藉壯精力、上場後、林周乘第三盤戰勝之餘威、復以六比四勝、</p>
<p>第五盤起始後、輪强及已成强弩之末、無力招架、惟林周亦稱現倦態、以致相持至十四局之久、始分勝敗、結查八比六、林周再勝、總計雙打林周以四比一大勝、</p>
<h3>（二）單打···林寳華六—三七—五飛伯</h3>
<p>球藝略評總觀是日之比賽、佳劣點甚多、姑就個人觀之林</p>
<p>氏之反拍、力似稍弱、正手擊球極佳、選擇地點、尤爲適當、較之往年固甚有進步、周景福昔一九二四年曾偕時昌黎赴遠東大會、球藝亦可觀、惟當防守時回高球過於近網、常爲敵所算、是其弱點、大鎭强極穏健反拍尤佳、威脫莫亞稍弱、飛伯擊球甚佳、但落點不見出色、</p>
<p>（三）單打···林寳華六—○六—一五—七一—六六—三大輪强</p>
<p>六日爲林寳華來津之第二次網球賽於下午二時半、仍在英球場原場舉行是日天氣極佳、適　合球戲故中外士女到場觀戰者、亦較上次爲多、約四百餘人、是日原定比賽單打及雙打各一、不意單打至第五盤第六局二比○時、林氏因比賽過久、腿部受疾、足底盡起水泡、加以前日經過度之比賽、約三小時之久、精神肉體、俱感疲倦因而腿部作痛、竟至倒地、後經抬至網球會所多方施救、方復原狀、乃勉强終場、結果以三比二勝、混合雙打表演經開　華大夫之勸告、未克表演、改由大輪强代替與梁女士同組、結果爲二比○、霞開及魏組獲勝、</p>
<p>球藝略評總觀六日之戰、林氏個人技術甚佳、正手抽球急而有力落點不易捉摸、可以取範、腦筋清楚、對方鍖誤之球不爲所愚、是其特點、反擊仍不見佳、近網高球、下壓無力、每爲敵所乘、望林君對此兩點、再加研究、以求深造、餘發球等均盡美盡善輪强擊球甚爲巧妙、能知已知彼、以智取不以力勝、不愧爲天津第一流名手、</p>

<h3>市童子軍大檢閱拾零</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>今春各地童子軍。曾由南都中國童子軍司令部。召往金陵。檢閱一過。今辰逢十九年之雙十國慶。遠近又有檢閱之舉。上海市由市訓練部先期議决。齊集大吉路體育塲。作大規模之檢閱。儀式極其隆重。十二日報已競載其事。茲摭拾會塲中之瑣屑。以告本談讀者。愚距會塲密邇蒞止絶早。主席台設塲之西隅。人跡猶稀。而市訓練部童行白部長。已從容稅駕。支配工作。狀至辛勤。首先報到者。爲愛國童子軍團。及某某西樂隊。最遲者似爲大西路光華之童子軍團。女童軍以兩江及東南團員最多。次則中國女體。男童軍以曁南人數最多。商整會最少。或以服裝色質制勝。或以操法純熟見長。唯其軒渠鼓舞致慶則一也。團斾迎風招展。與青天白日相輝映。景色乃圖畫。綜合報到童軍。凡三千有奇。每團如輔以西樂者。益見莊嚴肅靜之精神。當未舉儀式之先。愚頗以童軍與觀衆雜沓紛紜之非是。而于俄頃間。童子軍乃大顯身手。依次以木棍聨貫成一長陣。取包圍式。聲請觀衆後退。未五分鐘。秩序即井然。屬目四眺。鵠立矌塲者。唯見氣字軒昻而態度赳赳之黃色軍旅也。旋順序行禮。禮成。由總指揮導主席及機關代表。徐步至各團檢閱。全塲列隊若干排。檢閱諸君。即于每排環繞一周。檢閱畢。繼以訓話。詞長不備錄。然胥切中肯綮。本定全體出發遊行。因時晏乃各散隊稱息。午后二時起。表演遊藝。精彩特著者。當推東亞體校之瞭望台。爲極不不易之童子軍工作。高可二丈。需時僅數分鐘。其敏捷殊有足多。餘爲習見之遊藝表演。槪略而不書焉。</p>
<h3>郝壽臣之賽太歲</h3>
<p>— 徐筱汀</p>
<p>前晚與凈角巨孹郝壽臣君聚餐於會賓樓暢談助興逸趣橫生。壽臣持論。多本乎其好善嫉惡之個性。闡發精邃。深與其夙所处自勵之讀好書行好事說好話做好人四名箴方相吻合。斯殆得力於崇奉耶敎之功也余聆其說。始悟彼所以將審李七除三害二劇老戲翻新。增頭添尾而以全力赴之者蓋欲藉以箴貶世俗。促人勇於改過。洵能廣大基督博愛之眞旨者也現身說法。功德无量。又豈可以伶官而忽視之耶。</p>
<p>除三害　係漁晉周孝侯射虎斬蛟之故實。其事載諸史册知者頗衆姑不再贅。審李七一名白綾計。壽臣則易爲賽太歲。情節佳妙實裨史說部中之良材。因知其梗槪者尚尠。爰筆述於後焉。</p>
<p>宋有俠盜李七。（或謂李七係李奇之誤）兇惡驍勇。故有賽太歳之綽號。因報父仇未果。憤而投身綠林。横行無阻。威名遠振。卒於焚刦貪官包府之際。落案被獲。受審時忽誣秀士王良爲同黨。蓋李曩與王良因爭風而互毆於勾欄。故挾恨攀陷之也。官旣拘良。李憶及曾遭王踢一腿。被已扯落其靴。露出白綾裏腿一事。當即據以爲證。官受其紿。刑訊王良。王以荏弱之軀。不堪刑逼。坐致誣服。李七復於監内飽肆凌虐。王惟徒喚奈何而已。一日李王奉命起解。王之賢妻義僕。　同往長亭哭别。李目睹其遭誣屆情骨肉慘離之悲狀。天良激現。旣願脫王於囹圄。以滌前非。然又恨王之捨姣妻而迷戀烟花。致有此厄。情理亦欠通順。乃直言相斥。以儆玩心。（此段壽臣有大段說白。酣暢淋漓。不啻浪子惡少之當棒喝也。箴世諷俗。大有用心。）覆審之際。李盡翻前供。工代王昭雪。嗣逢大赦。均被釋歸。李後改過自新。服役軍旅。因勦海寇而建奇功。卒獲封賞。天之獎掖善舉。報施亦云厚矣。此劇原共十餘折。今只審七長亭尙未失傳。劇中做白多於唱腔。壽臣當之。爽辣可喜。游刃有餘。洵傑作也。</p>
<h3>將束小談</h3>
<p>— 何煮石</p>
<p>養成一種優秀的民族。須先注意到民族生活藝術化。吾國雖是一個文化啓發很早的國家。但是數千年來的階級觀念很深。藝術化的生活。在貴族是留意不到。在民衆過他們作息的機械生活而外。所謂『藝術化』的生活。是絕對談不到的。</p>
<p>『民族生活藝術化』是涵着很大很繁複的。現在舉了最重要的是兩種。就是裝束和建築。都是能夠整個的表現着民族的精神和文化。代表民族的昂壯和煥燦。</p>
<p>在新舊思想互激而成畸形的中國社會。在舊思想的人說。現在中國百業凋殘民生困疲的時候。就是民衆生活藝術化發達到極點。國人都成了審美家。也是無補於事的。况且談什麽考究服裝。這種見解是差了。</p>
<p>我們並不是所說的改善服裝。就是提倡奢侈。因爲裝束的美。是純美的。不一定是『千金一帙』就是美的裝束。我們祗要試想。看到别國優美的裝束會稱羡。看到了本國的遲開化民族的服裝。就說（卑劣野蠻）。世界人類眼光是同樣的。那末暫時談不到生族生活藝術化的中國服裝改善也是必要的。</p>
<p>目前中國的服裝男的脫不了袍褂的式様。至多改穿西裝。女的可就不同。三翻四覆。妖奇詭異。不知換了幾多式樣。到底終是『莫名其妙』罷了。現以終算砥的是滿式的旗袍同洋化的衣裝。</p>
<p>在全國第一個大都市的上海。表面上民衆生活較爲優越。裝束也較爲考究。新將店也很多。但是我不能承認那些造出詭異不合純美的服裝的新裝店爲完美。</p>
<p>石路三馬路轉角大新綢緞局。是革新的商店。他的産生。不能不說是適合新時代的需求。而他們特設的新將部。更不能不說是適合新時代需求而産生。他的長處是式樣觀富有東方文化古雅的點。和歐美文化流利的精神。於靜嫻中不覺單調。於富麗中免除繁瑣。並且我很佩服他們的技師。技巧很純熟。而且富有創作的天才。能夠依着女子的體態。做出時代化的新裝。那不是一件容易的事。我不禁讚一聲大新新裝『眞美善』了。</p>

<h3>比國印象記（上）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>一比國五十年紀念美術館。此館在比京。係比國紀念立國五十年并偉大建築物也。中爲紀念坊。左右即美術陳列館。館位居高原。可眺望前後大道十餘里。紀念坊之形式。頗似德國柏林之凱旋門。時値初秋。樹葉蔽天。比京街道之清潔。以此爲最。星期日公開展覽。不售門券。左館陳列各國名雕刻品四千餘點。原作較少。大半係翻印者。但世界名雕。盡入其中。意大利文藝復興期米格朗極羅之名作（黃昏。）高約三丈餘。亦有翻印物陳列其内。館中佈置次序旣佳。而每國皆有參考書說明。讼觀者得按圖查考。每件作品。編列號碼。檢查至便。右館陳列論各國之古美術品。以希羅馬。埃及。中國。印度之古物爲最多。埃及之木乃伊石刻之棺。計十　具。皆二千年前之古物也。中國歷代之古錢。陳列一室。其數甚多。該館入門處。有竢及金字塔模型一具。并有詳細法文說明書。分贈觀者。兩館所有古物以皆係比國皇家以鉅金收買者。　其價在數百萬金。歐洲各國。莫不重視藝術。尤以歷史上古物爲貴。比國自歐戰以還。又在比京新建美術陳列所數處。國家極盡提倡之責。藝術爲文化寵兒。欲窺一國之文化。當在藝術上揣摩。回憶偌大之中國以竟無一國家博物館或美術館。誠可嗼也。</p>
<p>二滑鐵盧　余幼時授地理科。知有滑鐵盧Waterloo之名。此次抵比京之翌日。即作滑之游。滑鐵盧離比京五十里。（中國里）先乘市内電車至中車站。再乘換市外電車。車行一時許。抵目的地。下車後。但見一平原中直立五尖形之土山。高聳雲霄。上有一碑。隠約可見。同游比人云。此即紀念當年拿破嵛戰士之塔也。步行一里許。已至山下。已至山下。隨游人登土山。山有坡。惟不其寬。自平地之頂。計二百二十五級。頂方形。正中建石碑一座。其上昂然立一猛獅。此係紀念英雄之象徵物也。在頂四望。平原無際。僅見表青黃一片。隨風蕩漾。宛若水波。回憶當年百戰百勝之拿破崙。雄霸歐土。險崖峭壁。尙不爲難。而平平大地。竟爲英雄失敗之地耶。在頂游覺增小時。攝景兩幀。下山後。人戰爭紀念館。該館即在土山之傍。余料館内所陳列者。必係戰具。購券入内。内建一圓　。廣十餘丈。上罩布幔。暗不辨物。由臺四望。但見戰旗密佈。礮火連天。軍隊激擊。馬不停蹄。誠驚人駭目之一大戰也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二九二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>翠筠正講到那裏。只聴得窗口的鈴聲響處。樓下的相帮喊道。三小姐。堂唱姓謝。一家春。那時翠筠正在剥蟹。一雙手指尖。正滿沾着蟹黃。便向房間裏的小大姐道。你去舀一面盆冷水。摘幾瓣菊花葉。讓我洗一洗手再去。不然。伸出手來。全是蟹腥氣。又向左詩晨道。二少。等我去出了一個堂唱。回來再講給你聽。好不好。你橫竪吃起來。有一刻兒工夫咧。左詩晨道。你把這一書說完了再去吧。聽得人家難過。你倒好像說書先生賣關子。又像做章回小說的。欲知後事如何。且聽下回分解了。翠筠道。我恐怕脫堂唱呀。左詩晨道。譬如在别地方出堂唱。也要轉過去。你就簡單點。把這段事實講完了。到底洪蓮香是怎樣死的。翠筠道。簡單倒簡單不来的。講一件事體。總要說一個原委。蓮香剛嫁去的時候。原是說明白住在外面的。殷老爺說。我們横竪在上海市房也不少。無論在英租界法租界。揀有空的住房佔一年。也不用太大的。有兩上兩下的房子也就彀了。依着蓮香的意思。伊是做人家的。說有一上下下也可以了。人少房子也不太多。殷老爺却覺得一上一下的房子好看。說若嫌房子太多。可以把樓下借給人家。自忆已佔一個樓面。也可以有照應一點。他當時便託了自已的經租帪房。留下一座兩幢頭的房子。但是一切布置。都是瞞着家裏那位雌老虎的。不但是瞞着雌老虎。連家裏人也一槪瞞住。因爲那位殷太太實在精明得很。倘然家裏人　知道了。不免要流露出來。伊却是能察言觀色。好像善谥審堂的老爺一樣。成嚇或騙。把犯人的口供都逼出來。蓮香在没有嫁殷老爺之前。雖然也有人傳述。說這殷太太是一位厲害脚色。可是問問殷老爺。他是絶對否認。也有人說。你要和家裏的太太。商明白了要討姨太太。那是一做不到的。姨太太没有討成。反而家裏吵得六缸水弗清。所以現在的老爺們。都不做那種獃事情了。現在的老爺們。都是用一種先斬後奏的方法。他們想到天大的事。没有解决不下的。起初是瞞過了家裏。把姨太太藏在外面。到後來漸漸兒家裏知道了。木已成舟。生米煑成了熟飯。只得併了宅。没有法子的丁。</p>

<p>青年園地</p>
<h3>雙十節參觀女宿舍</h3>
<p>— 廬</p>
<p>女宿舍本來是在莊嚴神聖的地方、無形中有『宿舍重地閒人莫入』的意義存在着、雖然有時可以登堂、但不許入室、</p>
<p>昨天是十九年度的雙十節、尤其是値得慶祝、所以曁大女同學會通過一條議案、說是從國慶日起女宿舍公開參觀二天、希望全校的師長同學們去參觀、可以提高女生的清潔、和自治的能力、及其他……</p>
<p>自有參觀消息傳出以後、即刻就閙得甚囂塵上、有的竟待得有演不過卯的常態、</p>
<p>居然於萬呼歡騰的國慶日的早晨、（九時）是開放了、</p>
<p>我們去的有五六位的男同學、當未進東宫之先、見宫前宫後已有很多的人在那裏蜿　前進、到了那巍峨嚴莊的東宫、門前除掉照例慶祝的張燈結綵以外、還有一張參觀的規則、裏面約分爲六條、大都關於時間及應注意的事項、不過有一條說、是不得翻閱抽屜和書籍等物、大槪恐怕像某年的『哀夫』大學裏的八四小姐抽斗中、被參觀人找出許多的良鄉栗子壳陳皮梅包紙和花生米皮的老調、因有前車之鑒、所以是禁止了、</p>
<p>東宫之口、何指導員和其他的幾位宫主是立着招待、尤其是這位何先生、滿面笑容、表示十二萬分歡迎的儀兒、和我們個個點首致禮、</p>
<p>走進宫内以後、第一間我們所瀏覽的、就是何先生的寢室、設床二計一大一小、每床的上面、都放有怙活潑可愛的洋囡囡、在那裏四圍牆隅遍懸懸着美術照片和其他的物品、裝潢精雅、可以算作全宫的　模範了、</p>
<p>此第称們由下而上、依次參觀、每房間的裝璜和佈置、各有所長、有的把檯子擺作長方形、平字形菱角形等、無形不備可稱煞費苦心、那檯上所用的檯布有用白的、也有用彩色紙和綠色絨的、那書架是和中西書籍均依高短次序的陳列着、比圖書館裏的還要整齊呢、</p>
<p>在某號裏、四璧都用柏林花紙糊過、各人的案頭、非常的華美、還有加上了美麗檯燈、生色不少、每只床裏的被頭、都像陳列櫉窗的折疊、而且房裏的宫主、均是不在、有人說、這是（樣子間、）</p>
<p>當踏進了名聞江南的楊澤蘅小姐的貴房裏、舉首就是她的未婚夫玉照、高懸在那牆上、望之神氣弈弈、誠是有爲的青年、可愛的伴侣、我深爲楊女士前途賀、</p>
<p>這天最忙的要算的女同學會的要人羅女士了、羅女士年高望重、老氣十足認識的同學尤其是多、這也是蜜斯羅、那也是蜜斯羅、看好眞正忙個不了、送糖菓呀、送茶點呀、後面的同學來者擁擠不堪、甚至谥痰孟和地板『刻斯』了、</p>
<p>聽說茶點要算十九號最爲精美、裏面有花旗橘子和新鮮水菓委多、可惜記者不熟、没有這口福、抱憾良深、</p>
<p>總之女同學的好美性、是比我們勝得多、尤其是一種共同合作精神、使我們欽佩、試問男同學那裏有這樣……呢、請諸位捫心自問便知道：、這並不是擁護她們、但事實是這樣的、無可韓言呀、</p>
<p>最後我們下來、在那門口有批評處、要我們批評、看别的已經有什歴（美術化）·科學化·整潔·優美·清爽……等等的字句、總不外乎眞善美而已、我們的批評當然逃不出這個範圍、不過此批評簿用的是洋紙、加上毛筆寫字、冩的人多不易乾燥、弄得不好、就成一糊漬、這未免有點美中不是吧、</p>
<h3>小衝突</h3>
<p>— 嘉</p>
<p>通訊</p>
<p>鼎</p>
<p>您忘記我嗎、這話雖然未免太兇、可是您想、快十二天了、没信給我、我的心焦您早已曉得、不給我信何故、我始終不解、疑問在心、使我功課也無預備、而發現到您更荒唐的地方了、</p>
<p>您是否想得幾個臭錢的稿費嗎、哼、冩給我的信居然登在報上了、難道我的地址都忘記了、要把信在報學發表來使我看到、可是懪鼎、我知道聰明的你不會這樣笨的、你看、報是大衆看的、一封信登在報上、如果報上印一份、給我看唯一的一份、那還可以、當然那油墨臭鉛字印的東西、那裏能敵得你秀律親書好、現在呢、大家看到了、大家是你的『嘉』、你、你、你見了這話、難過嗎、要哭嗎、這的確要給人家批的、我是十二萬分的不願意講、但在迫不得已咀咒你的時候、鼎、我說出了話、要請知道炮呢、唉、我忿極、</p>
<p>我氣極了、可是我又回想了、你是不會做這種事情的、你不是寫就給我的信、常常暗投入郵箱裏嗎、好、我又想到了、恐拍給梅偷去的、會開玩笑的梅給你投入、不過梅也太可惡、她開玩笑不應如此、至多也上應該敲一頓竹槓、可必要這樣玩弄我倆呢、我本來在梅二十歲生日、要送她一盒派克自來水筆、現在不該她了、鼎、你以爲如何、如果不送給她、她將來要做更惡習的事、那更糟、你想、仍舊送好嗎、再多送一點、來她下次下次不要這樣、好嗎、</p>
<p>當我看到報時、想立刻到報館去查詢、鼓氣的到報館門前、在門前徘徊了六七次、没有勇氣進去、這不是我没勇氣、實在發現着、恐怕主筆不見、或者主筆板起面孔說、登載之稿由報館負責、請、不必問、如果我進去受到這樣情形、我要更氣、所以仍舊回到校裏、同學們都講我了、什麽『情書公開、』『鼎女士的確大』方、』我受不下這樣話、於是走出去、四面亂走、又買了一份報、再來看着、又發現到一篇你抄給我看的『父與子』了、哦、奇怪、天下没有這樣事實呢、</p>
<p>我把這篇讀了又讀、覺得『玉無痕』太會寃枉人了、人是肉做的、他有慈愛心、雖然有的或許少些、但是堂的中學主任、難道就是没有慈愛心的人嗎、鼎、你大約也以作者的亂造、而你看了有感、要我來批評一下嗎、我講給你聴、做學校裏的主任、他對於學生負敎育職任、家長門是希望造成人材的、並不是送來給他利用的、鼎、以你來臂踰、你遇到同樣的主任、他呌你和家庭脫離、你肯嗎、骨肉分離、是天下最慘酷的事、有良心的人極端不會下這種毒手、鼎、我是不信這種事實、我斷定『玉無决痕』造『空中樓閣、』再就這位學生言、能幹極了、他讀書、還能做大會主席、這種人是將來的偉人、給　黨利用、哼、不會的、</p>
<p>可是我又回想了、想到『天無痕』又想到學校當局、『玉無痕』大膽會登這種文章、他眞有天大的勢力來亂講嗎、大學校是清白之地、極端不不能容這種揑迼者在内、學校當局應該查辦這事的、你不是說、有一位陳主任已經發怒了、他認爲於他有關係嗎、如果你說的話是眞確、那我又以爲這位主任對極了、因爲嫌疑是人人要避的、好像我、前天校中說我和王女土發生戀愛了、我是根本不認識那王女土、他們造謡、我就到訓育處請救查辦造謡者、我以爲訓育處一定准的、可是反敎訓我幾句、說我自已『做賊心虚』、只要自身清白、何必信謡言呢、這老古董的訓育主任、以爲我品行素來端正、所以呌我以後好好的、如果換了一個品行歹的、他馬早要反偵察我的行爲了、鼎、我眞氣呢、這股氣本想星期日看面告訴你、可是看了報、又加一屬氣、於是來看你的熱忱銷滅、當然那時我是恨你的、</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>這二重　　　出喚我眞好大　　鍚　香烟、拍幾次桌子、所以因我的事情、未批評你校裏的事、學校當局應嚴重辦理這　報呢、鼎、我再來大　的說一句、如果『玉無痕』不造謡、這事實眞是空前的、</p>
<p>還是上星期四吧、許來江灣的、他今日才來看我、談到復旦的壁報潮、他說看的人多呢、他親眼看到『父與子』的文章、他也不相信、後來在報上看到你的抄錄、他以爲你膽大極了、在大庭當衆間、會把這篇抄下來嗎、難道你硬記着、後來默出的、如果默出來、那你的記憶力强極了、我多歡喜呢、</p>
<p>不過、鼎、你以後不要再駡辦壁報的人了、要曉得我也想辦了、我也出些錢來辦、來做我們的言論機關、我興味濃極、後過三四天要和大衆見面了、不過我們女同學的消息是不登載的、雖然也有像阿枋這種人、我以爲阿枋是對的、他極端不會變猢猻、恐怕他會做神仙呢、如果他更寫『東宫春秋』、這是我們男子共同的意見、其原因、以後告訴你、不要急、</p>
<p>月兒圓了、我這幾天晚上總在草地上賞月、月餅吃夠了、方裕和的火腿月餅、昨兒玲姊託人由杭帶來、味兒不差、可惜給他們搶光、你没福吃、不過你不要哭、胆年月婚圓時、我們到杭州去吃個一飽吧、</p>
<p>寫了許多話、告訴你、這信寫出我氣消了、鼎、看了這信、或許你也會破涕爲笑呢、如果你的信是梅的作弄、而你也氣了、</p>
<p>你晚上點洋燭寫信、於身體旣不好、尤其是眼精要變近視、女子帶眼鏡、在我覺得不好、而且深更不睡、長久要患失眠症的、鼎以後不要如此、聽我的話吧、</p>
<p>在你校二十五週紀念愤、我一定來參觀、如果你做個招待員、來招待逨賓來賓是我、那更有趣味了、</p>
<p>葉園秋景我要來玩呢、與帶照相機來、替你拍幾張近影、好嗎、鼎、</p>
<p>嘉、於滬西、</p>
<h3>上海法學院法學研究會</h3>
<p>敦請應成一演講</p>
<p>法學院及法學研究會、於昨日午后三時敦請應成一碩士蒞會演講、題爲『社會觀念之發展及其變化、』聽講者極形踴躍、單該會會員已滿百餘、加之其餘同學、濟濟一堂、勢將有人滿之虞然歷兩小時之久、空氣仍靜穆如初、講者固精神煥發、而聴者亦娓娓不倦云、</p>
<h3>衛樂園與復旦中學</h3>
<p>衛樂園開幕了、煌煌的廣告、在各報上登着、『本園於某日起正式開幕、茲爲優待學界起見、第券祇收小洋兩角、……地址上海徐家匯復旦中學對面』、近在咫尺的復中學生、那個不想去一廣眼界、何况又是優待學界取價不過二角錢呢、</p>
<p>果然、有幾位同學、給悠揚的西樂聲、醉人的香艷舞吸引了、於某晚相伴着去瞻仰了、回來的時候、因爲已經夜闌更深、校門早已閉得水息不通、門房先生亦已睡得如死一般、他們没有法想、祇得一效樑上君子的『越墻而入』了、</p>
<p>事情發覺了、學校當局、訓育先生悉眉蹙額了、以爲『長此以往、學校校風、勢將不可收拾、且難免不有意外危險的事情發生、這個重責、誰能擔負、』因此、害得他們食不甘味、寢不安枕、遑遑終日、謀所以阻止之策</p>
<p>法子終於給們想出來了、每晚七時半、校門落鎖、任何學生不得再行進出——這是積極方面的、如有學生、再往參觀怀有風聞、立即開除、决不寛宥、——這是消極方面的、</p>
<p>誠然、法子是想得異常縝密了、可是例假外宿的同學、仍有許多要儉着去觀看、這並不是學校管理的不嚴、實在是他們自已失了自治的精神、自已輕視自已的人格、更進一步說、便昌　們一自甘堕落』、（莊鍔）</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>民族主義文藝論</h3>
<p>— 高偉</p>
<p>前鋒社編輯</p>
<p>大光書店發行</p>
<p>從民族主義文藝運動者關始於本年六月一日發表了『民族主義文藝運宣言』後、陷於畸形發展的病態中的中國文藝界突然呈現了活躍的氣象、凡是這新興文藝的推動力所到達的地方、無不獲得一般的深切的同情、這一方面固然是民族主義文藝的理論之充實、足以確立無疑、另一方面、也即是證明丁於這樣的時代裏、民族主義文藝誠爲一般所深切地需要、但它的力量的傳播、促起中國文壇藝壇的注意、委實是不可諱言的事實、到最近各方面響應的愈多了起來、這也未始不是中國民族的新生機的表現、但是民族主義文藝的理論、雖則受到了多數的同情、但必需要有深切的認識、而後才能來共同爲民族主義文藝作開拓的工作、不然的話、或能踏於誤解或曲解的危險、這樣、於、族主義文藝運動的前途也許會發生阻障的、因爲當前的問題即需要建樹正確的理論與一貫的中心思想、然後一切的創作却能在這正軌上推去了、民族主義文藝的理論、們都見之於前鋒周報、在前鋒周報上已經使一般的認識了這新興勢力的任務了、但是覺得這種理論没有彙集攏來是很可惜的、就是爲一般讀者也是不甚便利的、這本『民族主義文藝論可說是第一本理論彙集、</p>
<p>在這本『民族主義文藝論』中除『民族主義文藝運動宣言』外、共有七篇文字、都是爲建設民族主義文藝的理論的、</p>
<p>在『弁言』中千訴了我們、</p>
<p>就文藝本身講、文藝的産生、是從民族的生活意識裏來的、文藝的發展、是以民族主義做動力的、這是文藝的歷史可以證明、不容疑義的、</p>
<p>退一步講、就現在這個時代所需要的文藝說、我們中國也只有民族主義文藝的要求、當前的世界、不是帝國主義的强大民族壓迫弱小民族嗎、不是强大的民族以空洞的世界主義國際主義來欺騙鎭壓弱小民族的自决主義嗎、我們要使文藝爲人生盡一點力、對於民界民族盡一點公道、我們也不得不來致力於民族主義文藝的發揚、尤其是我們中華民族、處於帝國主義壓迫以及天災人禍的困苦艱難的境遇裏、更當以民族主義文藝爲唯一的武器、而打出一條主路來、</p>
<p>這是實在的、民族主義文藝在目前的環境中、更爲一般客觀的所需要着、現在我們在政治上正在要求民族運動、以求民族的新生命、但文藝旣與政治有密切的關係、則我們正需要就文藝上的民族主義的力量、而促進政治上的民族運動的速限即完成、這、還不是一個急切的問題嗎</p>
<p>這裏包含的—</p>
<p>（一）『中國文藝的没落』、先說明舊文藝的動摇、舊文藝的没落、新文藝過去的一瞥、新文藝没落的原因、新文藝的没落、而及挽救中國文藝的途徑、</p>
<p>（二）『民族主義的文藝』、在先把民族主義與文藝的關係闡明了、及我國文藝不以民族爲中心的原因、而後把民族主義文藝的特質全盤托出來、</p>
<p>（三）『從三民主義的立塲觀察民族主義的文藝運動』、這是一篇用客觀的態度來寫的、而對於方才萌芽的民族主義的文藝運動、抱有無窮的希望、</p>
<p>（四）『最近中國文藝界以民族主義的立塲來下了』個正確的批判、自五四（）動、以至五卅時期、以至國民革命時期、以至現在的文藝界、都下以相當的理解、關於著名的長篇和短篇的創作、均有嚴密的批評、</p>
<p>（五）『苦難時代所要求的文學』、是把苦難的漩渦、苦難的實况、民衆的心理、忠實地宣露出來、其次把苦難中文藝的退嬰與自暴自欺說明、而再解釋當前的問題、最後說明突破苦難的武器是只有使用民族主義、</p>
<p>（六）民族主義文藝動的使命、是最値得我們注意的一篇、作者就是承認『政治與文藝、有密切的關係、政治可以影響文藝也可以影響政治、』現在政治上民族主義運動底使命、是求民族之自由平等、文藝上的民族主義運動底使命、作者就是把民族主義文藝運動宣言裏所規愃的、（一）在形成文藝上民族意識的確立、（二）在促進民族向上發展的意志、（三）在排除一切阻礙民族進展的思想、（四）在表現民族一切奮鬥的歷史諸端、加以詳盡的發揮、在結論中、作者更這樣地喊道、『我們深信民族主義文藝能夠深深貫注在全民族的各個份子的心理中、中華民族才會達到成熱與優秀的目的、同時中華民族的文藝、方能臻於偉大不朽的境界、』我想、這也是誰都在企感着的吧、</p>
<p>（七）『民族主義文藝之理論的基礎』是次序地討論民族主義、以及民族主義文鞯藝的意義、都一一用分析的方法來解剖、使我們讀了、更易清楚、</p>
<p>上面是把内容大略的介紹籽、這裏、再想來報告一件好消息的、就是該社申明正預備着印行第二本民族主義文藝論集、是從詩歌、小說、戲劇、音樂、圖畫、文藝批評各方面來討論民族主義的、其次又正預備出幾種月刊雜誌、不久可以出版、他們這様說、『總之、我們還有點勢力、我們還有點意識、我們對於民族主義文藝的運動、我們要　幹下去的、做了第一步工作。再做第二步工作、再做第三步工作……』這樣、我們期待着吧、</p>
<h3>時代青年</h3>
<p>— 南心</p>
<p>第八九期</p>

<h3>Formal Opening of the Sino-Russian Conference</h3>
<p>Karakhan delivers the opening address… Elucidates the obligations of the three agreements. The issue of the Boli Conference Record… Will be discussed further next time. The Sino-Russian conference, convened by Moscow in accordance with the agreement of December 22nd of last year, held its first meeting yesterday. Russian representative Karakhan and Chinese representative Mo Dehui spoke successively. Subsequently, the issue of China's clear and explicit recognition of the Boli Conference Record, as proposed by the Russian representative, was discussed. Karakhan stated that despite China's efforts, it has not been able to change its relations with other countries based on the Sino-Russian agreement. He also stated that the Jingfeng Treaty and the Boli Conference Record are the most important documents for regulating Sino-Russian relations, and the Russian government highly desires that the spirit and letter of the Jingfeng Treaty be strictly observed. Mo Dehui replied that although there have been misunderstandings in recent years, China has always wanted to foster friendship with Russia and that China will abide by all legally concluded treaties between China and Russia to comply with international obligations, which is beyond doubt. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The plenipotentiary representatives of China and Russia, in accordance with the Boli Conference Record of December 22nd of last year, held their first formal meeting here today. First, the Soviet Russian plenipotentiary representative Karakhan, on behalf of the Russian government, welcomed the Chinese representatives. Then the Chinese plenipotentiary Mo Dehui gave a reply. After mutually examining the credentials, the discussion began on the issue of the Chinese representatives' clear and unambiguous recognition of the Boli Conference Record, as proposed by Karakhan. After some negotiation, it was agreed to continue the discussion at the next meeting and the meeting adjourned. Karakhan's opening remarks stated in brief: The Sino-Russian conference agreed upon at the Boli Conference Record has commenced its work today. This conference should have been held on January 25th, but unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond the control of the Soviet Russian government, it was postponed for nine months, which is regrettable. However, I hope that the circumstances that caused this postponement in the past will not hinder the progress of the formal meeting again and cause the extremely important work concerning the two countries to be delayed again. The Boli Conference Record has determined the scope of the issues that we should discuss and resolve, and the principles guiding this negotiation have also been clearly defined in the 1924 Beijing Agreement. Therefore, the work of commencing the conference today has been greatly facilitated to a certain extent. The Soviet Russian policy towards China is based on the principles defined in the two declarations towards China in 1919 and 1920, which have been fully expressed in the Beijing Agreement and the Conference Record. The Russian government's policy towards China is to abandon all unfair special rights obtained by the Tsarist Russian government from the Chinese nation by force, and to sympathize with the Chinese nation's struggle to abolish unequal treaties, achieve complete independence, and eliminate all obstacles to free development. In 1924, the conclusion of the Sino-Russian treaty opened a new era in the history of China's relations with other countries, and it was also the first time that China concluded a completely equal and reciprocal treaty, which was sufficient to consolidate its position in the struggle against unequal treaties. Therefore, it was deeply sympathized with by all sectors of China and regarded as a precedent for concluding equal treaties. However, even with China's efforts, its relations with other countries have not yet been based on the Sino-Russian agreement, which is something we all regret. I can only sincerely hope that China's efforts in this regard will achieve victorious results. As for the Soviet Russian government's consistent and firm implementation of the Beijing and Feng-Russian agreements, it is needless to say that it will strictly abide by their spirit and letter. Unfortunately, a major conflict occurred between Soviet Russia and the Chinese authorities in 1929, which lasted for six months and led to the severance of all relations between the two countries, as well as the invasion of Russian territory by armed forces, which forced the Russian authorities to take corresponding actions. It was not until the Boli Conference Record of December 22nd of last year that this most serious conflict was resolved, peace was re-established on the border, the agreements previously concluded between China and Russia were restored, and the China Eastern Railway returned to its normal state. Therefore, the Soviet Russian government considers the Boli Conference Record and the 1924 agreement to be the most important contracts for adjusting the existing relations between the two countries and forming the basis for today's conference. It is hoped that the Chinese representatives, at the beginning of today's work, will also recognize the 1924 Beijing and Feng-Russian agreements, as well as the Boli Conference Record of 1929, which stipulates the existing relations between the two countries, as international contracts, which are a larger basis for seeking a final solution to all issues in Sino-Russian relations in a spirit of friendship and complete equality, and the work of this conference will be guided by them. If both parties strictly fulfill the obligations within the aforementioned three contracts, it will increase and consolidate the friendship between the two countries, and promote and complete the work of this conference. I hope that the representatives of the Republic of China will agree with this point. While welcoming Mr. Mo Dehui and the Chinese delegation, I sincerely wish the work of this conference success, resolving all outstanding issues between the two countries, increasing the harmony between the two great powers, and creating a permanent and solid peace in the Far East. I hereby announce the opening of the first meeting of the Sino-Russian conference. Mo Dehui's reply stated in brief: The Soviet Russian government's repeated declarations to China in 1919 and 1920, and the Chinese government and people, deeply believe that both great nations have a deep desire for peace and friendship, which truly enabled the two countries to conclude an agreement in 1924, establishing a solid foundation for developing their relations. China has always abided by the legal agreements concluded between China and Russia in a spirit of equality and mutual assistance, and has always been loyal and sincere in seeking the greatest interests of both countries. Unfortunately, contrary to expectations, misunderstandings have arisen between the two countries in recent years, which we deeply regret. However, the Chinese government and people still adhere to the desire to enhance the goodwill between the two countries and strive to promote friendship, and will never change this aspiration. All treaties legally concluded between China and Russia will be adhered to by China from beginning to end, which is a natural obligation in international relations, and there is no doubt about it. Today, the Sino-Russian conference has opened, and we have gathered here with the same sincerity expressed in previous negotiations to resolve the issues that both parties have agreed to discuss here. We firmly believe that the work of this conference will be completely successful, achieve favorable results, and increase the welfare of both countries.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Germany's Revision of Treaty Theory</h3>
<p>According to a Paris dispatch, former French Prime Minister Herriot gave a speech at the Radical Socialist Party Congress advocating the maintenance of world peace and Franco-German friendship, saying that without Franco-German friendship, it would be difficult to guarantee peace. However, he opposed the revision of the treaty. Herriot's meaning is that Germany's revision of the treaty would make Franco-German friendship impossible and peace unsustainable. His words are very clear. According to a London dispatch, the French government is currently exploring the British attitude towards the current political situation in Germany. If Germany one day proposes to revise the Treaty of Versailles, change the status of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, or request a postponement of the reparations in the Young Plan, how will Britain deal with it? This is the French government taking a further step to consider how to respond after Germany proposes to revise the treaty. The three countries of Germany, France, and Britain are the center of today's world situation, and the future of peace depends on them. If Germany, as repeatedly reported in newspapers, is eager to restore the pre-war state, uniting with the other sympathizing countries, such as Austria, to advocate the implementation of treaty revision, then the first to bear the brunt would be France. France would also unite with other countries to resist. If this is the case, not only would international friendship be impossible, but feelings would worsen and the crisis of peace breaking down would be imminent. This is what concerns those who care about the world situation. Some say that Germany's advocacy is just a part of the political parties wanting to use the people's psychology of revenge to rally public sympathy and gain political power, and not necessarily wanting to implement treaty revision. Moreover, the current political situation in Germany is uncertain, and political power may not necessarily fall into the hands of the extreme right wing, so this extreme proposition may not be realized so quickly, and the crisis of peace may be averted as a result. This is the luck of the world.</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi Submits Resignation as Secretary-General of the Headquarters</h3>
<p>Nanjing Central Committee member Shao Lizi returned to Nanjing from the front at 5:00 p.m. on the 10th and immediately submitted a petition to the Commander-in-Chief, requesting to be relieved of his duties as Secretary-General of the Headquarters. The original petition is as follows: Respectfully submitted, the Headquarters has never had a Secretary-General in its organization. Lizi was appointed in April, and because the expedition against the rebellion was imminent and there were few personnel in the headquarters, he reluctantly exerted his meager abilities and dared not refuse. However, in the past few months, due to his lack of talent, the affairs have been numerous and trivial, and his nature is clumsy, making it particularly painful to deal with. Although he has not been reprimanded, he is very uneasy. Now that he has returned in triumph, he respectfully requests that he be allowed to be relieved of his title as Secretary-General with immediate effect, so that he can still follow Your Excellency in a leisurely manner and make a small contribution. He is deeply grateful. Furthermore, since Lizi was appointed, the organization has not been changed in any way, and no personnel have been added. It is even easier to relieve him of his position.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, (Special dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign News</p>
<p>British Autonomous Colonies</p>
<h3>Proposed Tariff Revisions</h3>
<p>The British Government Expresses Reluctance to Accommodate</p>
<p>London, November 11th (Reuters) - The Imperial Conference will not hold formal sessions today or tomorrow. British Prime Minister MacDonald traveled to his country villa this morning after the funeral procession for the victims of the R-101 passed through London. He has invited Australian representative Scullin and representatives from South Africa to dine there tomorrow. Currently, the most noteworthy issue at the conference is the economic problem, particularly the proposals for tariff revisions and increased preferential treatment for Imperial products. The Canadian Prime Minister's suggestions on this matter have been helpful in the discussion. The British government has clearly stated to the participating representatives that while it is willing to discuss any proposals, two general conditions must be considered: (1) the British government cannot agree to any proposal that raises the cost of living in Britain; (2) existing trade agreements cannot be abruptly changed. Last night, cabinet members spoke in various locations, mostly about Imperial trade matters. The Minister of Commerce, Graham, stated that the British people are consumers of food and raw materials, and taxing food and raw materials would be detrimental to the British people and Britain's important industries and commerce, and would also provoke retaliatory tariffs. The British government will strive at the Imperial Conference for various methods of commercial development and seek an agreement with representatives from overseas autonomous territories, but the autonomous territories should not expect Britain to levy taxes on food and raw materials.</p>
<p>London, November 11th (Pacific News Agency) - The cabinet majority has decided not to accept the proposal from various autonomous colonies at the Imperial Conference regarding mutually preferential tariff measures. However, the Conservative Party and most industrialists and businessmen welcome it.</p>
<p>London, November 11th (Pacific News Agency) - Various important economic groups, the Imperial Industries Association, and the National Federation of Commerce and Industry have all submitted requests to the government, asking it to accept the mutually preferential tariff measures proposed by the autonomous colonies. The former head of the Egyptian office strongly criticized the government for negligence, which has resulted in foreign countries seizing markets throughout the Empire. The Labor Party's official newspaper stated that if the principle of free trade is abandoned, the government's collapse is not far off. The Minister for Overseas Autonomous Colonies hosted a banquet for representatives from various colonies and spoke to them, saying that while each representative prioritizes the interests of their own nation, with the interests of the Empire secondary, speaking on behalf of the Imperial government, our first consideration should be the entire Empire.</p>

<h3>Conflicting Reports on the Brazilian War</h3>
<p>Government Claims to Have Recaptured Key Fortresses</p>
<p>Revolutionary Forces Claim Expanding Momentum</p>
<p>London, November 11th (Reuters) - The British cruiser HMS "Delhi" sailed at full speed today from Trinidad in South America towards Pernambuco in Brazil.</p>
<p>Washington, November 11th (Reuters) - The American cruiser USS "Saratoga" has been ordered to Guantanamo and will proceed to Brazil if it becomes necessary to escort American citizens out of Brazil.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, November 11th (Reuters) - The Brazilian government announced in a public statement today that government forces have defeated rebels in the Para province and are expected to restore peace soon. The revolutionary forces claim that twelve of the nineteen provinces in the country have now absolutely joined the revolution, leaving only seven provinces for the central government.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, November 11th (Reuters) - The Brazilian destroyer "Maranhao" engaged with revolutionary forces outside Imbituba today in an attempt to cover the landing of government troops, but the government troops were ultimately repelled.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11th (National News Agency) - News from Brazil is exceptionally contradictory. Based on various reports, it seems that government forces have achieved victories on several fronts, preventing the revolutionary forces from converging on Sao Paulo. Furthermore, the government has successfully attacked the fortress of Balbazina in the Minas Gerais province, recaptured key fortresses along the border between Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, and airdropped food to government troops trapped in the city of Belo Horizonte. However, the revolutionary forces have left three central columns to occupy the capital of the main coffee-producing region, and two flanking columns are advancing on the capital. Therefore, the government has recalled reservists under the age of forty to fight, but the people are indifferent to the mobilization.</p>
<p>Paris, November 11th (Pacific News Agency) - The Brazilian embassy announced that five cities in the state of Minas Gerais have been recovered by government forces.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, November 11th (Pacific News Agency) - Four of the seven opposition party members in the Brazilian capital have recently been arrested. Revolutionary forces claim to have occupied the cities of Antonio and Sao Francisco, and the road from Florianopolis to Buenos Aires is reportedly cut off. News from Bagé indicates that the garrison in Cruz Alta has mutinied. The Brazilian Minister of Interior declared that government forces have defeated the revolutionary forces in the Para province and that the garrisons in Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul are extremely loyal, and the government can restore peace within the shortest possible time. News from Bagé indicates that the navy, despite landing, was repelled, and the area of Itapiranga has been occupied by revolutionary forces.</p>

<h3>Air Defense and Attack Exercise in Tokyo Bay</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 12th (Dentsu News Agency) - The naval special grand maneuvers centered on the Pacific coast of southern Japan began on the 10th. From 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM on the 11th, the Oppama Aviation Corps and the Tateyama Aviation Corps conducted an air defense and attack exercise over Tokyo Bay. At 8:00 PM, upon hearing of an enemy air raid, parts of Yokosuka City, Uraga Town, Tateyama Town, and their vicinity were blacked out, becoming dark cities. The sound of enemy planes attacking in the dark of night aroused a strange tension in the hearts of residents in the area. Before long, several enemy planes and several defending planes began a night air battle. Some enemy planes broke through the air defense line and flew over the city, dropping several bombs that missed their targets. The enemy forces were illuminated by the searchlights of the defending forces and shot down by anti-aircraft guns, giving observers the feeling of witnessing a real battle. The blackout in preparation for last night's night raid was 100% effective.</p>
<h3>Problem of the Japanese Government's Supplementary Plan</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and Navy Cannot Compromise</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi's View on the Current Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 12th (Dentsu News Agency) - The Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance listened to the Navy's explanation of the supplementary plan yesterday, lasting for ten hours. They will continue to listen to the explanation on the 13th. The financial authorities of the Ministry of Finance are taking a strong stance on reducing the supplementary plan expenses. The military, on the other hand, advocated for the supplementary plan in the Privy Council and responded with it, so they are also committed to thoroughly implementing it, ending it in agreement with the Navy, expressing their opinions, and are determined to realize it.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 12th (Dentsu News Agency) - The Navy and the Ministry of Finance have significant disagreements regarding the supplementary plan. Both sides are maintaining a strong stance and are not willing to compromise. Prime Minister Hamaguchi asked Minister of Railways Eguchi to mediate. Eguchi met with Navy Minister Abo on the 10th to exchange opinions, reported the results of the meeting and the military's views to Prime Minister Hamaguchi on the 11th, and visited Finance Minister Inoue at 5:30 PM to inform him of the Navy's views. He then summoned Vice Minister of the Navy Kobayashi to his private residence at 4:00 PM to inquire further about the military's views. It is said that Vice Minister Kobayashi told Eguchi that the Navy could not accept the government's plan to set the supplementary plan at around 350 million Yuan, and a supplementary plan of that size would be absolutely useless.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 12th (Dentsu News Agency) - Chief of the Naval General Staff Taniguchi departed from Nagoya Station at 2:29 PM yesterday to visit Ise Shrine and observe the naval grand maneuvers, bound for Uji Yamada. In the train, he told visiting reporters that the contents of the supplementary plan were all secret and could not be revealed, so there was nothing to criticize. Soldiers only need to focus on their military duties. It is natural for the Ministry of Finance to strive to reduce supplementary plan expenses, and both sides have the same goal of serving the country. The media should focus on the global situation and support those who are right. Negotiations with the Ministry of Finance regarding the supplementary plan have not yet begun, but there will inevitably be some turbulence.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 12th (Dentsu News Agency) - Prime Minister Hamaguchi went to his villa in Kamakura on Saturday afternoon at 3:00 PM, as usual, for a weekend rest. Hamaguchi, wearing a kimono, told reporters in the villa's garden that he had not heard anything about the revision of the Privy Council's administrative regulations, so he could not comment on them. Regarding the supplementary plan, the Ministry of Finance and the Navy are currently negotiating, and an appropriate solution should be reached after the special grand maneuvers. Regarding the unemployment problem, the government will decide on an appropriate method after observing future developments, first considering the results of the national census, and then considering other social undertakings, before making a political judgment. Therefore, there is nothing to say about unemployment policy at present. He also said that it is not possible to rashly determine whether the economic downturn has reached its peak. Lowering the discount rate for gold and silver again, which is said to contradict the government's non-debt financing and austerity policies, is an inaccurate and blind criticism, and in fact, there is no contradiction at all. As for measures for rice prices, quantity adjustment is probably necessary. Raising market prices artificially is feared to be infeasible. As for specific plans, everything is left to Minister of Agriculture Machida. He has not yet consulted the Rice Grain Committee regarding the revision of the Rice Grain Law, and it is not yet known whether it will be submitted to the parliament for discussion.</p>

They encountered wind and rain en route, and the sky was pitch black. They flew in the dark all night. The next morning, after inspecting their location, they found that they had been blown 400 miles south of their course by the storm, and the 100-gallon auxiliary fuel tank had failed. They decided to dump the fuel into the sea. However, the fuel had been gradually used up, and the wind was strong, so they urgently wanted to land. They landed on the island of Sicily after flying for 23 and a half hours. Today, they flew to Croydon Airport in London, where they were welcomed by a large crowd.</p>

<p>Madrid, November 11th (Pacific News Agency) - A general strike has been declared in Vitoria, creating a state of rebellion. Striking workers clashed with non-striking workers, resulting in several deaths. Various movements have occurred in Huelva, Seville, and Malaga, all stemming from the Communist Party.

<p>Tokyo, November 12th (Dentsu News Agency) - Due to the catastrophic drop in rice prices, rural areas are extremely impoverished, and the landlord class is greatly affected.

To remedy the future, the landowners have decided to promote a grand alliance centered on the Japan Landowners Association, uniting landlord organizations across the country to rise up. They are scheduled to hold a standing committee meeting from the 20th to the 25th of this month to formulate specific articles, and the inaugural meeting of the National Rural Organizations Federation will be held no later than next spring.</p>
<h3>Gradual Improvement in the Japanese Spinning Industry</h3>

<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial Service for Sun Yat-sen's London Peril</h3>
<p>October 11th was the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's peril in London. The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial ceremony in the Grand Auditorium at 7:00 AM. Attendees included Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Peide, Gu Yingfen, Shao Yuanchong, Li Wenfan, Ye Chucang, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Chen Yaoyuan, Chen Zhaoying, Ke Xinge, and other officials from various departments and representatives from various institutions, totaling about 500-600 people. Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that Sun Yat-sen created the revolution. Thirty-five years ago, after an unsuccessful campaign in Guangzhou, he immediately went to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia for secret work. When he arrived in Singapore, a certain person who had served as an official in Guangdong and Chaozhou, who had been sent by the Qing Dynasty, followed Sun Yat-sen's ship and secretly investigated. Sun Yat-sen noticed this and spoke with the investigator, revealing the corruption of the Qing government, the danger of the Chinese nation, the inevitability of national subjugation without revolution, and Sun Yat-sen's purpose of saving the country through revolution. The investigator was greatly moved and said, "I will definitely not report your whereabouts to the Qing government, nor will I investigate your actions again. Within a year, I will definitely not return to China." He then left the ship mid-journey. When Sun Yat-sen arrived in London, the American and British embassies, under secret orders from the Qing court, tried to arrest him. On this day, sixteen years before the founding of the Republic of China, he was lured into the embassy and imprisoned in a room, guarded by two British servants, in preparation for sending him back to the mainland for persecution. Sun Yat-sen hid letters in a coal basket and persuaded an English servant named Cole to carry them out and seek help from Sun Yat-sen's close friend Cantlie. He was finally released on October 23rd. From this, we can see Sun Yat-sen's great fearlessness and determination that no force in the world could resist the Three Principles of the People. We also feel that Sun Yat-sen's peril was extremely important, as he was able to adapt to the situation and escape unscathed. The existence of the Republic of China today is the result of the crystallization of Sun Yat-sen's spirit, ideology, and talent. We should have a full sense of admiration for him and regard him as a model when reviewing past events. Then, Ye Chucang spoke, saying that Sun Yat-sen's life was great and had two key points that could serve as the foundation for revolutionary success and the only example for comrades to rush to the future of revolutionary amalgamation: (1) the more dangerous the period, the more he could show his fearlessness; (2) every time he experienced danger, he made progress. In general, people only know that Sun Yat-sen experienced two perils, in London and Guangzhou, but in reality, Sun Yat-sen endured hardships and storms for forty years. Because of the warlords and all reactionaries who obstructed national construction, he was deeply worried and almost every day was a peril. The tyranny of the warlords and all reactionaries harmed the Party, the country, and the people. In the period when the Party and the entire nation were in peril, it was also the period when Sun Yat-sen was in peril. Although Sun Yat-sen has passed away, his spirit will not be extinguished. We should carry on the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's perils and strive hard. The ceremony then concluded.</p>

<p>Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun Deliver Admonitory Speeches.  Shenyang Dispatch: Zhang Xueliang assumed the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force at 11 a.m. on the 9th at the auditorium of the Provincial Government.  At 9 a.m., he departed from the Frontier Commissioner's Office to the main street of the Provincial Government, where a strict security cordon was established by guards, police, and military police, prohibiting the passage of idlers.  The Air Force Command also dispatched nine aircraft, soaring in the sky and scattering leaflets.  The details of the inauguration are described below.  Before 11 a.m. on the same day, consuls from various countries and leaders from various institutions and organizations arrived to observe the ceremony.  The adjutant's office dispatched personnel to distribute red flowers for identification, totaling 400 flowers.  However, since there were 700-800 guests present, many who arrived later did not receive flowers.  At 11 a.m., Zhang, accompanied by his guard commander Liu Duoquan, adjutant Tan Hai, cavalry captain Wu Taixun, and more than ten others, arrived at the main reception hall of the Provincial Government to the sound of military music.  He wore a military uniform.  Shortly after, the oath administrators Wu Tiecheng and Zhang Qun, accompanied by Section Chief Guo from the adjutant's office, also arrived.  The inauguration ceremony was then held according to the scheduled procedure.  First, the master of ceremonies announced the seating arrangements.  The oath administrators, Wu Tiecheng (left) and Zhang Qun (right), stood before the ceremonial table, while Zhang Xueliang stood in the center, slightly further away from the table.  Behind him stood Zhang Zuoxiang, Tang Yulin, Wan Fulin, Zang Shiyi, and others, the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces, standing solemnly in attendance.  The ceremony proceeded as planned.  Zhang Xueliang then raised his right hand and recited the oath, which stated, "I will sincerely implement the Three Principles of the People, follow the teachings of the Premier, defend the country, love the people, and diligently perform my duties.  This is my oath."  After Zhang finished reading, he affixed his seal to the oath.  Then, Wu Tiecheng delivered an admonitory speech on behalf of the Central Party Headquarters: "Today marks the occasion of Comrade Zhang Hanqing's swearing-in as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Shenyang.  On behalf of the Central Executive Committee, Tiecheng is deeply honored to participate in this solemn and grand ceremony.  The Party's government specifically entrusts this important task to Deputy Commander Zhang, knowing that Deputy Commander Zhang firmly believes in the Party's principles and accepts the mission of the National Revolution.  This time, mobilizing troops to enter the Pass, supporting the central government, and quelling internal strife are precisely to implement the flag change of the previous year, promote unification, and maintain the proposition of peace.  Therefore, the righteous voice spreads, the rebellious bandits tremble, the perverse air subsides, and peace is seen again.  What the people now expect from the Party's government is how to treat the symptoms, plan for the aftermath of military affairs, and relieve the people's suffering; how to treat the root causes, plan for the fundamental construction of the country, and establish the foundation for lasting peace.  The task is heavy and the road is long.  I hope that Deputy Commander Zhang will assist Commander-in-Chief Jiang, work together with one heart, and jointly plan for progress.  The future of the Party and the country truly depends on this." Zhang Qun delivered an admonitory speech on behalf of the National Government (the text of which was published in yesterday's newspaper), so it is omitted here.  Zhang Xueliang replied, "Today, I, Xueliang, follow the orders of the National Government and assume the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  I am deeply moved and grateful for the admonitory speeches given by the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government.  Reflecting on national affairs, times are difficult and urgent.  My talents are meager and the task is heavy, and I deeply fear that I will be unequal to the task.  I can only恪遵the Premier's instructions and diligently perform my duties, so that the foundation of the country may be laid and become more consolidated, and unification may be achieved at an early date, thereby repaying the Party and the country for their earnest exhortations and living up to the expectations of the people throughout the country.  I respectfully record these few words for your kind consideration." Finally, Wu Tiecheng shouted slogans, and all the people in the hall responded in loud voices.  After the shouting, all the guests in the hall bowed three times to Zhang Xueliang to offer congratulations, and Zhang returned the courtesy to the crowd.  Then, he personally went to the reception hall and greeted each foreign guest individually.  Afterward, photos were taken in the courtyard of the Provincial Government, and the ceremony ended.

<h3>Xia Douyin's Troops Triumphantly Arrive in Hankou</h3>
<p>Zhu Huaibing, Wan Yaohuang, and Others Accompany</p>
<p>Two Regiments and One Battalion of Troops Arrive in Hankou. Hankou Dispatch: Xia Douyin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-first Route Army, Zhu Huaibing, the Commander of the Thirteenth Division, and Wan Yaohuang, the Commander of the Thirty-seventh Brigade, and others, received orders on the 8th of this month to lead their troops south from Xuchang on three trains. Xia and others were on the first train. The troops accompanying them were the First Replenishment Regiment, the Special Service Battalion, and one regiment of the Thirty-eighth Brigade of the division. The entire Thirty-seventh Brigade and the two regiments of the Thirty-eighth Brigade were on the second train. The headquarters and directly subordinate units of the Twenty-third Division were on the third train. At 6:30 p.m. on the 9th, Xia's military train arrived in Hankou. Those who were waiting at the station included Wang Shi, the representative of the General Headquarters, Wu Xingya, the acting chairman of the Provincial Government, Liu Wendao, the mayor of the Municipal Government, Zuo Duo, Yu Yuzhi, and Yang Zaichun, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Cha Guangfo, a member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Qian Dajun, the commander of the Third Teaching Division, and others. The Replenishment Regiment, the Special Service Battalion, and one regiment of the Thirty-eighth Brigade of his troops were immediately stationed in Wuhan. The troops carried on the second train passed Xinyang early on the 9th and got off at Huayuan at noon to take over the road protection. The third train continued to arrive on the 10th. This reporter recently visited Mr. Xia and obtained his remarks as follows: "Our division received orders to be transferred to the Jinpu Line to fight. When the Thirty-eighth Brigade arrived at Qufu, the Jin army attacked with a force of five divisions. At that time, I was still in the rear, and I transferred the Thirty-seventh Brigade to join the front line. At the same time, I telegraphed Lu Bentang, the commander of the Thirty-third Brigade, to hold Qufu firmly. Although the enemy attacked fiercely, Lu did not move. After a fierce battle for ten days, when the Eleventh Division arrived, we launched a joint attack and won victory after victory on the Jinpu battlefield. The battle of Tai'an was particularly fierce. At that time, the central army outflanked from both wings, and I was in charge of the front, leading the troops to attack vigorously, so that the enemy had no time to take care of both sides, so that our left and right wings could easily succeed. The enemy did indeed increase its reinforcements and resisted desperately because of the fierce attack by our division. Our friendly forces on the left and right wings were able to outflank the enemy and recapture Jinan. Our division also completely defeated the enemy in Tai'an. After the end of the Jinpu War, our division was ordered to be transferred to the Pinghan Line to fight, so we began to transport westward from the Jinpu Line on August 20th, and deployed to the right side of the Pinghan Line. After receiving orders to launch a general attack, we attacked and advanced along the railway from Zhoujiakou, and defeated the enemy Ren Yingqi and other troops in Weichuan, Changge, and other places. Then we attacked Suliqiao and transferred to Xuchang. Now, because the war ahead has come to an end, we received orders to return to Hankou in Xuchang. Except for the 37th and 38th Brigades, which were ordered by Director He to be stationed in the Huangpi and Xiaogan areas south of the Pinghan Road, the division headquarters, directly subordinate troops, and Replenishment Regiment 1 and 2 were stationed in Wuhan for reorganization and training.

<h3>Min Army Attacks Yanping in Campaign Against Lu</h3>
<p>Sun Benrong Returns to Fujian to Mediate Peace. Fuzhou Dispatch: Liu Heding's division and Liu Shangzhi's brigade of the Northern Fujian Army have recaptured Shuikouguan, the border between Minqing and Gutian counties. Lu Xingrong's brigade of Lu's troops has retreated to Zhanghuban, the border between Gutian and Yanping. Lin Shuguo's brigade, which was in the Gutian area, has also recaptured Gukou. Zhou Zhiqun's brigade of Lu's troops has retreated to Huangtian, the border between Gutian and Yanping. Lin Shuguo is currently transferring Lin Bingzhou and Liu Gangde's two regiments of the Marine Corps and Qian Yuguang's brigade of the Provincial Defense Army from Gukou and Liucheng to attack Huangtian. Zhou Zhiqun is also fighting desperately. From the 4th, a fierce battle has been fought at Tiandinggang, the center point of Gukou, Liucheng, and Huangtian, with extremely intense artillery fire. According to naval news on the 6th, Zhou's brigade is unable to resist, and most of them have retreated towards Zhanghuban, leaving only a small team to fire back from the positions to provide cover. Currently, the general reserve brigade, Chen Wantai's brigade, has advanced from Baisha and stationed in Shuikou. Minjiang transportation, ships can now sail directly from Hongshan to Shuikou. Yanping has been greatly shaken. Lu Xingrong is rushing to build defensive works in Zhanghuban, and has also gathered his sworn brothers from Youxi, his direct troops Zhang Xinglong and Ye Xingjin's regiments, to guard the area between Yanping and Zhanghuban to prepare for the final battle with the Provincial Army.</p>
<p>Although the various units of Liu's division have arrived in the Shuikou area, due to the terrain above Huangkou and Gukou, military affairs cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, there is also a movement for Sun Benrong to mediate the Fujian situation. Sun arrived in the province from Shanghai by the Wanshang Wheel the day before yesterday and stayed at the Huaji Grand Hotel. The peace plan he is advocating has been revealed to the military authorities, and he has secretly discussed it with Fang Shengtao several times. Therefore, there are rumors that the provincial government has proposed three conditions to Lu Fang: (1) Lu's troops retreat into Youxi to be reorganized; (2) Lu Fang hands over Lin Zhiyuan and other six people; (3) Lu Xingbang and Lu Xingrong relinquish military power. Whether this statement is credible is not easy to speculate. However, at 9 a.m. yesterday morning, the Provincial Party Steering Committee held its 131st meeting, chaired by Zhan Diaoyuan, and discussed the matter of suppressing Lu extensively, and appointed four members, Lin Wang, Gan Zhan, as representatives to go to the provincial government to inquire about the military situation of the Lu Suppression Army. It also sent a letter to the provincial government, ordering the commanders-in-chief of the east and west routes to thoroughly suppress Lu. When they arrived at the provincial government, they coincided with Yang Shuzhuang, Liu Heding, Chen Jiliang, Fang Shengtao and others, holding a military meeting. Yang immediately sent Chen Peikun to meet them and exchanged views on the suppression of Lu. Chen said that the party and government's advocacy is generally in line with the views of the Party Headquarters, and Chairman Yang will definitely respect the opinions of the Party Headquarters, etc. The results of the military meeting remain secret, but Fang Shengtao is scheduled to return to the defense tomorrow, so the plan must have been decided.

<h3>Shaanxi Disaster Increasingly Severe</h3>
<p>Rats Damage Crops, Harvests Hopeless</p>
<p>Starving Corpses Unburied for Months. The Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee reported on the recent disaster situation in Shaanxi Province, stating,</p>
<p>The disasters in Shaanxi Province are tragic and prolonged. The general populace, without clothes or food, is struggling to survive. Those who were spared from starvation and were able to preserve their lives were only able to do so thanks to your newspaper's vigorous promotion and widespread appeals, which has bestowed such grace upon them. The sounds of gratitude are heard throughout the province. On behalf of the eight million disaster victims who have received relief and survived, we respectfully thank you for your great virtue. We also earnestly request your continued kindness on behalf of the eight million disaster victims who are currently struggling to survive. This year's summer crops have already been extremely meager, and the early autumn has been dry. What we rely on to sustain our lives is only a small portion of the land that has received sporadic rainfall and can be irrigated with well water. Sowing late rice may still be a comfort to farmers, but unexpectedly, since July, locust plagues have occurred again, obscuring the sky and covering the mountains and fields, breeding and multiplying, and extermination is ineffective. The leaves and fruits of the crops have been eaten without remainder. Cotton and reed leaves have also been damaged. In addition, rats have damaged the crops in Jingding and other counties, which is equivalent to locusts. Examining the entire province, there is no place that is not affected by the disaster. Currently, more than seventy counties have reported urgent requests for relief. There is no hope for the autumn harvest, and the disaster situation is becoming increasingly severe. Recently, villagers have been pushing and transporting rafters, benches, and agricultural tools, filling the streets and alleys, and selling them one after another in order to survive their current lives. The tragic situation is not only difficult to describe in words, but also unbearable to witness. In the blink of an eye, the wheat planting season is approaching, but there are no seeds at all, and there is no rain. If we miss the timing, the consequences will be unimaginable. Our livelihoods are cut off, and we endure the time as if it were years. Woe to my people in Shaanxi, who will be their savior? We respectfully and tearfully plead, and respectfully request that you promptly show compassion and continue to promote and appeal to kind-hearted people at home and abroad with the intention of saving people and thoroughly rescuing them, so that the people of Shaanxi can escape this great calamity. Then the grace given before will not be in vain, and the help given later will be effective. We will be forever grateful and will certainly repay your kindness. The telegram is urgent and we are extremely grateful. Deng Changyao, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Committee, Yang Rentian and Sun Weidong, Standing Committee Members, Zhang Weifan, Yang Mushi, Zhou Yong, Wang Zhi, Han Fan, Lu Xiaoyu, Lv Yizhai, and Zhang Dianyao, Members. In addition, the Shaanxi Disaster Situation News Agency reported on the disaster situation in Mei County, saying that Zhu Qinglan had previously sent a special envoy to Mei County to distribute emergency relief. According to the special envoy's report, there are still more than 2,000 starving corpses in the county that have not been buried for several months, and villages and towns are in ruins and fields are desolate. After hearing the news, Wai immediately sent personnel to cooperate with the burial team, carrying reed mats and other items to the county for burial. The severity of the Shaanxi disaster can be seen from this. Shaanxi Disaster Situation News Agency.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Requests Restoration of Rice Market</h3>
<p>To Save Declining Commerce. Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, in view of the decline of Zhenjiang's commerce, is eagerly seeking ways to revive it. The best way to revive it is to revitalize industry and develop commercial districts. However, both of these cannot be implemented immediately. As a stopgap measure, there is a plan to restore the old rice market. Recently, the chamber has listed the reasons and submitted them to the provincial government for review, requesting approval for restoration. The reasons are extracted as follows: (1) It is found that in the early years of the Qing Dynasty, during the Guangxu period, the rice market was located at Liuhaokou and other places on the opposite bank of Zhenjiang. Because the river collapsed, it moved to Zhenjiang. Most of the rice transported was shipped from Anhui Province to Zhenjiang for sale, and then fully loaded with other goods and left. Therefore, when there was a rice market, trade in all industries was also prosperous. Hundreds of thousands of coolies and workers relied on it for their livelihoods. In the 27th year of Guangxu, the Governor-General of Liangjiang transferred it to Wuhu out of private intentions. As a result, Zhenjiang's commerce suffered great damage. This is extremely unfair. If we want to build a new Zhenjiang, it seems appropriate to restore it as soon as possible so that farmers, industry, and commerce can all benefit. (2) Jiangbei is a rice-producing area. In years of good harvest, the rice produced cannot be sold in large quantities, and unscrupulous merchants inevitably secretly transport and smuggle it abroad. In the past, when Zhenjiang had a rice market, rice from Jiangbei was transported to Zhenjiang. After the rice market was closed, little rice came to Zhenjiang from Jiangbei. This is clear evidence. If the Zhenjiang market is restored, the rice from Jiangbei will concentrate in Zhenjiang. How can smuggling be avoided? If it is said that Zhenjiang can also be smuggled, then the official authorities will strictly define enforcement methods, and there will be no smuggling. (3) The capital's rice market can absorb rice from the provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, while Zhenjiang's rice market can also absorb rice from the counties in Jiangbei. Moreover, last year, there was a drought in the Lixiahe area, and all came to Zhenjiang to buy rice. If Zhenjiang has a rice market, Jiangbei can rely on it in years of good harvest, and it can also provide relief to Jiangbei in years of famine. In terms of regulating food, Zhenjiang's rice market is even more important and practical. (4) Recently, banditry in Jiangnan and Jiangbei has become increasingly rampant, mostly due to the difficult lives of the people. Zhenjiang's land is barren and the people are poor. Even those with land do not have enough to support their families, and many without land become bandits. In the past, those in Jiangbei counties who had no land or houses all regarded Zhenjiang as a place to find food. Since Zhenjiang has no rice market, fewer goods are imported and exported. Coolies have no way to find food. Once the rice market is opened, all industries will prosper. Those who carry burdens and seek food will have a way to make a living. There will be more workers and fewer bandits. This is an essential element for maintaining security in Jiangnan and Jiangbei. (5) It is found that Wuhu's rice market, in addition to the regular donation, also has a special donation. If Zhenjiang opens a rice market and collects a special donation of 5 jiao per dan, the annual income will definitely be huge. It is not difficult for the provincial capital to use this huge sum to plan for construction.</p>
<h3>Local Communications Songjiang</h3>
<p>Lost Girl Unclaimed: The County Public Security Bureau reported that a lost girl, about 12 years old, was sent to them by the 3rd sub-station the other day.

There is no way to find her family. She is temporarily kept in the orphanage. A missing person notice has already been posted for days. The child misses her parents very much and sobs constantly, which is particularly pitiful. It is heard that Director Zhu intends to send her to the Shanghai Relief Association for Women and Children if no one claims her again.</p>
<p>Graduation of the Senior Police Refresher Course: Zhu Huanbo, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, established a senior police refresher course in order to refresh police administration and increase the knowledge of the senior police. The course has now been completed and the two academic subjects have been graded with good results.

<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Watching Lantern Parade, Jewelry Robbed: Zhao Yaying, the wife of Qian Yiqing, the principal of the town's elementary school, is also a teacher. On the night of National Day, after watching the lantern parade, she was on her way home. When she passed the Nanfeng alley entrance on County Front Street, a hooligan wearing a large hat suddenly grabbed Zhao's hand and robbed a gold bracelet and a watch. Zhao was caught off guard and stunned without making a sound. Later, her husband reported it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, but there are still no leads.</p>
<h3>Jinshan</h3>
<p>Lvgang Town Robbed by Bandits: On the night before yesterday (11th) at about 8 p.m., several bandits under the command of Tai Bao Ashu suddenly came to Jinshan's Lvgang Town.

However, the amount of losses has not yet been fully investigated.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>A Strange Murder Case on the Double Tenth Festival: A strange murder case, similar to rape and murder, occurred in Suzhou on the Double Tenth Festival. The court is currently investigating. The deceased, Li Renshui, was a 21-year-old plasterer from Xiangshan. He lived at No. 4 Jinjia Alley, Dawangjia Alley, Hulong Street for five years. His father, Maotou, died eight years ago. He lived with his mother, Ms. Huo, who is 51 years old. He also has a cousin, Lu Fubao, 41 years old (currently working in a machine shop in Xihui outside Qimen). Because Li was naturally cautious and obedient, Ms. Huo kept him at home. There are eleven tenants in the house, including a woman named Peng Huangshi, 55 years old. Since her husband, Peng Baosheng, died nineteen years ago, she has lived there with her lover, Wu Zengrong (51 years old, recently returned to Suzhou after working as a partner at the Longxing Candle Shop in Changzhou), her eldest son Shou Nian (currently a merchant in Shanghai) from her previous marriage, her second son Yong Nian (currently in Wuxi), and her younger sister (25 years old, not yet married) on the upper floor. Her bedroom is directly across from the deceased's room. The deceased and his mother lived in a room facing north, and Lu Fubao lived outside Li's bedroom. Younger sister and her mother's lover, Wu Zengrong, also had an affair. Previously, the deceased had brought his sister Huang Dongshi's four-year-old niece, A'er, from No. 8 Xishan Chang Alley back home the day before. On the morning of the tenth, Ms. Huo went to help at a wedding at the Tang Zihai's house nearby. She told Li Renshui not to go out and ordered Lu to return early. At 1:00 PM, Ms. Huo returned home from the Tang's house with melon seeds and other food. She saw Renshui and her niece lying on the Beijing bed. She woke them up and told them to eat. Because the Tang's family was busy, she left quickly. Unexpectedly, at around 3:00 PM, Lu Fubao returned home and immediately reported that Li Renshui had been murdered in his room. The corpse was lying on the floor, with a bamboo pole as tall as a person on his back. His feet were tied with silk thread, and his neck was wrapped three times with a carrying pole across it. The police station immediately detained Wu Zengrong, younger sister, and others. Zhong, a prosecutor from the local court, arrived to examine the body. The deceased was naked, without clothes or pants, only wearing one sock. His clothes and pants were placed on the edge of the bed. Blood was flowing from his left nostril, and a rag was in his mouth. His left hand was pressing on his genitals, and his right hand was on the opposite side, seemingly also tied and untied. Semen had overflowed from his genitals and was trampled flat. One of his testicles was crushed. According to Lu Fubao, when he entered the door, he saw Wu Zengrong coming out of the alley, looking flustered. Younger sister was making socks in the middle of the building. Zhu Shenshi, the wife of a rickshaw puller who lived downstairs, also said that she had seen Wu Zengrong go upstairs once before the incident. When questioned, Wu himself said that he had gone to the Qiuyue Tea House at the entrance of the alley with relatives at about 1:00 PM that afternoon and had not returned home. Younger sister claimed that her father did accompany relatives to the tea house for tea and that she was at home and did not hear any noise in the deceased's room. The deceased's sister, Huang Dongshi, also said that she had gone to the deceased's house at 1:00 PM that day and saw that the deceased was still well. This proves that the incident occurred after Ms. Huo returned home and left. Ms. Huo claimed that after she returned home, she heard firecrackers being set off at a happy event, so she left quickly. Lu Fubao, the reporter, said,</p>
<p>that he returned home at around 3:00 PM. Because he heard firecrackers being set off at a happy event, he entered the door quickly, intending to wake the deceased and take his niece, A'er, out to watch the excitement. Unexpectedly, when he entered the room, the deceased was already lying on the ground. Considering the above circumstances, the time of the deceased's murder was extremely short. According to the court's examination, the deceased was tied up and then trampled on, causing suffocation and death. Therefore, the rope around his neck did not leave any deep marks, but the crushing of the testicle was also fatal. The naked body and the semen on the genitals proved rape and murder. The case has now been transferred to the court for investigation. Younger sister is the key to the case, and Wu Zengrong is the most suspected, which can also be asserted. Niu Yongjian Inspects the Zhaobi of Yuanmiaoguan: Niu Yongjian arrived in Suzhou from Beijing yesterday (the 12th morning) and inspected the Zhaobi of Yuanmiaoguan with County Magistrate Huang. He then went to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Capture and Transfer of Notorious Thief Shi Hongpei: The notorious thief Shi Hongpei led his gang and committed all kinds of robberies. He was previously arrested once by Zhu Youlin, the leader of the water police detachment. After being released, he became even more reckless and rampant. Recently, Ni Gusheng, the detective chief of the Second District of the Provincial Water Police Team stationed in Wuxi, received a secret report stating that the criminal was hiding in the Qishuyan area of Wujin County and requested a quick arrest. After receiving the report, Detective Ni immediately led detectives such as Sheng Shangzhi to rush to the address for investigation. Yesterday morning, they spotted the thief at Qishuyan Station, planning to take a car to Shanghai. Detective Ni and others immediately stepped forward, apprehended the thief, and escorted him to Wuxi. However, when they arrived under the Gongyun Bridge near the Ganxing Silk Factory, the thief suddenly jumped onto the roof of Ji Yunqing's house, fled to a neighbor's house, and hid under the bed. After being directed by a member of the neighbor's family, they were able to capture him, escort him to the detective team, handcuff him, interrogate him severely, and then transfer him to the district office for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Capture of Bandit Dai Guifa in the Fourth District: Dai Guifa, a notorious bandit from Lujiatang in the Fourth District of Wujin County, fled to Shanghai during the previous bandit suppression.

He was escorted to the city on the eleventh for interrogation.</p>
<p>A Kidnapping Case Occurred at Yangtou Bridge: Zhou Ronglin, who lived near Yangtou Bridge in the First District of Wujin County, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits with guns in the middle of the night on the ninth of this month.

<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>The Rampant Increase of Pirates in Juegang: The number of pirate ships along the coast of Juegang has been increasing recently, causing disturbances everywhere. Residents are extremely frightened and are moving away one after another. The two townships of Nankan and Jiuzong in this district were raided by pirates the day before, who robbed the homes of Zhou Jue and others and kidnapped more than ten men and women. It is reported that the pirates kidnapped Zhou's daughter-in-law and, seeing her young and beautiful appearance, kept her as the wife of the pirate leader. They declared to her family that they would not release her even for a large sum of money, causing the family to be extremely saddened. In the Changsha Shiwuzong area, the family of Chen Fu'an, a fisherman, was ordinary. At around 9:00 PM the other night, more than ten pirates suddenly came with box guns and flashlights, kidnapped Chen's wife, and abducted Chen Fuyue and Fuyue's daughter from the same garden. The bandits tied up Chen and others and headed northwest to Zhang Lin's house, where they kidnapped Lin and his sixteen-year-old daughter as well. Near Nankan, tenants of Zhou Jue's family in Caijiadun were suddenly visited by more than forty armed pirates at around 10:00 PM on the first of this month. They broke into the house and abducted seven men and women. They then went to Cai Delin's house and abducted four men and women. A farmer's family in Zhima Village near Nankan was also suddenly visited by dozens of kidnapping bandits at around 11:00 PM on the first night. The family noticed and escaped through the back door. The bandits looted wildly. After the incident, it was inspected that about several hundred yuan was lost. Grandma Kuan, who ran a sesame seed cake shop, and Zhu San's wife were carrying a package, a leather suitcase containing a leather robe, and a jacket with 120 yuan in cash. They were seen by the bandits while fleeing and were kidnapped as well. The Remnants of Pan Kaiqu: Pan Kaiwu recently led more than ten bandit ships to patrol the ports of Changsha, demanding flags from all the Zhang Gu, Zhang Xie, Zhang Tiao, and fish and shrimp roads, claiming that if they did not receive the Pan family's flag, they would burn the ships. The ships were divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Class A was charged 60 yuan, Class B was charged 5 yuan, and Class C was charged 40 yuan, which was changed every four months.</p>

<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Strict Prevention of Reactionaries on National Day: The Wuxing County Public Security Bureau received an order from the county government yesterday, stating that the tenth of this month is the anniversary of National Day, and celebrations will be held everywhere, which must be very lively. At this time of cunning communists and rebels, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no reactionary elements taking the opportunity to engage in activities and plot unruly events. Therefore, it is necessary to secretly and strictly prevent them in order to maintain local peace. In addition to issuing orders, the bureau chief is hereby ordered to immediately instruct his subordinates to pay extra attention to prevention.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Yin Shoulun, Trial Officer of Jiangyin County</h3>
<p>Recently, I read a letter from Wang Jiwu, the magistrate of Jingjiang County, in the letter column of your newspaper on October 7, which contained a report from your newspaper on September 29 regarding a conflict between the county magistrate and the trial officer, as well as a report from Jiangyin on October 4 regarding Magistrate Li's retention of Trial Officer Yang, both of which are inconsistent with the facts. I was shocked and surprised to read it. After investigating the origin of this matter, it was because of handling a smoking case. Except for Wang County Magistrate's instruction to fine 300 yuan and Yin Trial Officer's possession of several documents, the reports in your newspaper are all accurate. Regarding the penalty for smoking cases, Jingjiang is the heaviest. The fines for smoking cases in August were nearly 3,000 yuan. The Public Security Bureau has never issued a single cent of the reward money despite so many fines. Therefore, there was a joint meeting to collect rewards from various branch bureaus. The New Jingjiang Daily published a charging rule, which caused a lot of complaints locally. At the end of August, the Accounting Office finally issued more than 300 yuan in reward money to the Public Security Bureau. In September, our trial officer consulted with Wang County Magistrate to improve the smoking case handling method, imposing lighter penalties. In special circumstances, he was ordered to pay a deposit before being released on bail. This adds a restriction on bail to the increased legal income, which is both in line with Article 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law and not contrary to the purpose of the smoking ban. With more legal income, the prison food would not be exhausted, and the report of charging rewards according to law would inevitably be enthusiastic. Wang County Magistrate agreed and instructed our trial officer to do so. On the 22nd of the previous month (Wang County Magistrate mistakenly called it the 25th), the county government reported that two smoking offenders, Xia Yilong (Wang County Magistrate mistakenly called him Xia Yilong) and Liu Yaofang, were arrested. Xia was sentenced to a fine of 20 yuan and two months of imprisonment, and Liu was sentenced to a fine of 30 yuan and three months of imprisonment. The charging method was announced in court to encourage reporters to clear up the smoking ban as soon as possible. After the sentencing, they were legally detained and sent to prison for execution after confirmation. Not long after, local people came to the government to apply for bail, so our trial officer ordered them to pay a deposit of 300 yuan. Wang County Magistrate was furious and questioned harshly, saying that the deposit was ten times the fine (saying, "Why can't you fine more? I can fine 999 yuan too").</p>
<p>It's not too much.) At that time, our trial officer still lowered his voice and said that this deposit was to guarantee the execution of the imprisonment and could not be proportional to the fine, and he would follow the county magistrate's instructions. If the county magistrate thought it was inappropriate, he could reconsider and the trial officer would follow. Local people witnessed and can testify to this reply. I ask, what激what激烈</p>

<h3>Annual Meeting of the China Cooperative Society (1)</h3>
<p>Situation on the First Day: The China Cooperative Society held its second annual meeting at the Hangzhou Construction Personnel Training Institute yesterday (the 10th). The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>

The preparation time was three months.</p>
<p>Grand Opening Ceremony: The official opening of this annual meeting of the society was held at 2:00 PM on National Day. In addition to the members attending, there were also hundreds of guests, such as Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Wu Zhihui, Central Committee Member, He Yushu, representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Xiang Dingrong, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department, Cheng Zhenjun, representative of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huo Baoshu of the Zhejiang Agriculture and Mining Department, Tan Xihong of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, Zhao Fangrui, Superintendent of Hangzhou Customs, Liu Shixin, Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, etc.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: First, Chen Guofu delivered the opening speech, stating that the China Cooperative Society was established two years ago, the second year after the death of Mr. Xue Xianzhou, a pioneer in the country. At that time, cooperative comrades felt the needs of society, so they actively engaged in investigation, publicity, guidance, research, and other work after its establishment. Chen Zhongming went to Europe, and Zhang Dingzhi went to the Jiangzhe area in the country to investigate the current situation of cooperation. The editing and distribution of the series of books and daily publications, the dispatch of personnel and communication, guiding the actual organization of cooperatives, and discussing various issues have all been past work. However, at present, the domestic people have not fully understood cooperation, and the essence of cooperative undertakings is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the colleagues of this society have a major responsibility for the promotion and development of Chinese cooperation in the future. I hope that colleagues can move forward with the greatest determination and perseverance, and I hope that people from all walks of life can provide guidance so that we can work together to struggle, and then the future of cooperative undertakings can be optimistic. Next, Central Committee Member Wu Zhihui, Cheng Zhenjun, Director of the Construction Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Ma Yinchu, Xiang Dingrong, representative of the Provincial Party Department, He Yushu, representative of Jiangsu Province, Zhang Zongcheng, representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, Tong Yumin, representative of the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department, Tan Xihong of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, Wu Xinmu, representative of the Quzhou Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Zhang Jinghao, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, Feng Binjia, representative of the Nanjing Municipal Social Bureau, Di Angren, representative of the Changsha Qunyi Cooperative, etc., all gave speeches and reports.</p>
<p>Members' Speeches: At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, Sun Hanbing, a member of the society, gave a speech on the radio station of the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Situation on the Second Day: The first meeting was held on the morning of the 11th. Yu Jingtang was the chairman, and the meeting was held as usual. The most important matter in the first meeting was the discussion of the plan for developing the national cooperative movement. The plan first stated that if the cooperative undertaking in China wants to develop in the shortest period of time, it must have a detailed plan. Moreover, the new China under construction is currently in the tutelage period, and the central government has stipulated that the tutelage period is six years. During these six years, the most important facility of the government is to establish the foundation of local autonomy. However, to establish the foundation of local autonomy, the formulation of the plan cannot be delayed. Since the cooperative movement is an important measure for implementing local autonomy, it is especially necessary to start preparing first. After careful discussion, the outline of the plan has been passed, and five people, Wang Shiying, Xu Shaodi, Chen Zhongming, Hou Houjing, and Tang Qizi, have been elected as members of the resolution sorting committee to be responsible for sorting out the text of the plan and other resolutions. It is said that once the sorting is completed, it will be submitted to the central government for adoption to benefit the progress of cooperation.</p>
<p>Continued Speeches: Chen Guoqu went to Zhejiang University on the afternoon of the 11th to give a speech (The Direction that the Cooperative Movement Should Take in China in the Future). At 2:00 PM on the same afternoon, Tang Qizi gave a speech at the Police Academy (The Police Officer and the Cooperative Undertaking). Xu Shuji gave a speech at the provincial government's radio station (Agricultural Finance and the Cooperative Undertaking).</p>
<p>Banquets from Various Institutions: Various institutions and schools in Hangzhou have been holding banquets for members of the society for several days. On the afternoon of the 11th, Zhejiang University held a banquet at the school. During the banquet, President Shao Feizi gave a welcome speech and reported on the school's attention to cooperative undertakings and the process of experimentation.

Then, Cheng Zhesheng, the section chief of the Construction Department, and the chairman gave some answers to the opinions expressed by the speakers before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Meeting Record of the National Anthem Review Committee</h3>
<p>Soliciting National Anthem Extended to the End of This Year: The Ministry of Education previously solicited national anthems, which ended at the end of September. The Ministry of Education organized a National Anthem Review Committee and held the first review meeting last month. After deciding on the review standards, the submitted items were reviewed separately. It was felt that there were a large number of items, but very few could meet the set standards and could be adopted. Therefore, it is necessary to extend the solicitation period to the end of this year in order to obtain better works. The situation of the second meeting of the National Anthem Review Committee is recorded as follows: The second meeting of the National Anthem Review Committee was held at 3:30 PM on October 9 in the meeting room of the Ministry of Education. Chen Shizhen, Wu Yanin, Liu Dabai, Zheng Tianting, Zhu Jingnong, and Peng Baichuan attended the previous meeting. (1) The meeting was held as usual. (2) Report: Director Chen reported that the national anthems solicited by the Ministry from various places rarely meet all the requirements. Recently, the Ministry has received inquiries from various parties asking about the results of the election every day. Should the Ministry select and announce the best ones that have already been received, or should the solicitation period be extended to show solemnity? Please discuss. (3) Discussion results: 1. Extend the solicitation period to the end of this year. 2. Issue a notice to all provinces and cities and publish an announcement in newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangzhou, extending the solicitation period. In addition to continuing to publicize the original solicitation methods for soliciting lyrics, add several additional explanations.</p>
<p>(Based on the review standards determined at the first meeting) and add that those who decline remuneration may do so, but they must indicate it after the lyrics. 3. The lyrics that have already been received will continue to be reviewed by each committee member. A period will be set for discussion.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Approves the Establishment of Jiangnan College</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently issued an instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, stating that the bureau had previously submitted a table of matters regarding the establishment of the private Jiangnan College and requested approval for its establishment.

Based on this, the Ministry found that the college's regular expenses had been adequately prepared in accordance with regulations and should be approved for establishment. The bureau is instructed to inform the college accordingly.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Tong Xingbai reported, stating that the Boy Scouts have lacked a central organization for several years, leading to many disputes and little progress. The five members of the Shanghai Municipal Boy Scout Council were elected the day before yesterday and are taking office today during this grand review. After the establishment of the council, the Boy Scouts will have a leading organization to seek the development of the Boy Scout cause, which is truly gratifying, and so on.</p>
<p>Glimpses of Speeches: (1) Xu Guanyu, the special Overseer dispatched by the Headquarters of the Chinese Boy Scouts, admonished, saying, "Esteemed council members, the Boy Scout cause is of great importance, and Shanghai is particularly the focus of national attention. Therefore, the Headquarters attaches great importance to it and knows that your responsibilities are heavy. It is hoped that you can be loyal to your duties, work hard to serve, consistently and sincerely, to seek the development of the Boy Scout cause. This is what is deeply hoped for," and so on. (2) The Director of the Municipal Training Department said, "It is gratifying that you are being sworn in during this National Day grand review, and that the council is being established from now on. Shanghai Boy Scouts have found capable leadership. After this, sorting out and developing will involve numerous details. What is considered most important is, first, that everyone must have a sense of responsibility; second, that they must be able to correct themselves in order to correct others; and third, that they should not only seek quantitative development but also qualitative enrichment. The task is heavy and the road is long. Let us work together," and so on.</p>
<p>Reply from Council Members: New council member Shen Yu, on behalf of the others, replied, stating, "We are grateful for your trust in us and being elected as the first council members of this city. We feel that our talents are mediocre and our responsibilities are heavy, and we are extremely apprehensive. However, we believe that this is a duty, not a right. Now, under the guidance of our superiors, we will certainly strive to do our best to live up to the expectations of the Central Municipal Training Department and the Boy Scouts of the entire city," and so on.</p>
<p>Joyful Gathering in the Evening: The Municipal Training Department believes that the Boy Scout Council is extremely relevant to the future development of Boy Scouts throughout the city. With the swearing-in taking place, it is like a ray of light shining on the future. Moreover, with the National Day auspicious occasion and the grand review being a grand event, the opportunity was particularly good. Therefore, at 7:00 p.m. that evening, all council members and representatives of the Headquarters were invited to a banquet at Duyi Restaurant. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the conversation was lively, creating a grand scene. According to Representative Xu from the Headquarters, who spoke to the reporter, the establishment of the Shanghai Council is the first in the country, and so on.</p>
<h3>Lao Da School Affairs Conference Cables the National Government to Quickly Appoint a President</h3>
<p>Stating Three Reasons</p>
<p>The National Labor University has dispatched representatives to petition the National Government to urge the government to quickly appoint a president, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we have obtained a cable from the school affairs conference of the university to the National Government and the founder, as follows: (Titles omitted)</p>
<p>Your esteemed office: Former President of this school, Mr. Yi Peiji, was unable to concurrently serve as the president of this school because he was a central government official. This school was unable to persuade him to stay, which is deeply regrettable. Since the president was relieved of his concurrent position, almost a month has passed. All faculty and students of this school have been eagerly awaiting the appointment of a new president so that they can actively carry out school affairs. The school affairs conference has sent representatives to petition, but a new president has not yet been properly appointed. All faculty and students of this school are extremely apprehensive. This school is one of the national universities, and all internal organizations follow the university regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The president is in charge of all administrative matters of the school. According to the organizational law, how can there be a day without a president? We must request the quick appointment of a president. This is the first reason. The school affairs conference is the legislative body of the school and cannot exercise the president's powers. Since President Yi's departure, we have deeply felt that the school affairs conference exercising the president's powers has many shortcomings and is difficult to make school affairs progress actively. We must request the quick appointment of a president. This is the second reason. This school is the highest institution of labor education in the country and bears the mission of realizing the Prime Minister's agricultural and industrial policies. This is a pilot project, and the complexity of its school affairs is even greater than that of other national universities. It is especially indispensable to have a president to preside over school administration in order to achieve practical results. We must request the quick appointment of a president. This is the third reason. In summary, we earnestly request the quick appointment of a president to maintain the labor education of the country. We are extremely eager. The School Affairs Conference of the National Labor University respectfully submits this message.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Football Club Defeats Zhenru Overwhelmingly</h3>
<p>Score of Twelve to Zero</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Football Club had a total of nine teams playing. The match between Zhenru and Youyou of the "Zhong" team was the most interesting. Youyou was mostly composed of veteran stars. When they galloped across the green field, they were like warhorses and golden spears, proud of their image. Thinking back to the days of competing for dominance, they must have had countless great battles in football, which are passed down as legends. Today, however, their energy is gradually declining, but their ambition has not died. They are still trying their best to compete. Victory or defeat is not their concern. This was their first match, and they happened to meet the strong team Zhenru, resulting in a loss of twelve goals. Whether the veteran stars are happy or sad, the reporter does not know.</p>
<p>(1) Lineups of the Two Teams</p>
<p>Zhenru Team: Jiang Zongxin, Chen Chunxiu, Jiang Shanqing, Dai Linjing, Chen Fuzhong, Yang Baosen, Zeng Rongzhong, Yun Fenglin, Chen Jiaqiu, Luo Haiguang, Zhang Rongwen, Chen Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Youyou Team: Chen Shao, Zhang Mingzhang, Shen Baigui, Ye Jinjin, Chen Jixiang, Mao Honggui, He Bohong, Shao Leping, Shi Youhui, Hu Youcheng, Zhang Xien, Wang Caigao, Hu Renjie</p>
<h3>(2) Match Summary</h3>
<p>Relying on their agility and strong physique, Zhenru launched a fierce attack from the start. Youyou defended their key positions, and the game remained a stalemate. After ten minutes, Zhenru got a corner kick opportunity, and a ball fell into the net. Center forward Luo Haiguang greeted it with his head, scoring a header. However, he broke his head and bled, unable to continue the game. He retreated successfully and left the field. Ten minutes later, Zhenru got a second corner kick, and the goalkeeper mistakenly hit the ball into the net. After another fifteen minutes, Youyou took the lead in the front, and the entire army went out, leaving the interior defense empty. Chen Jiaqiu and his comrades took the opportunity to break into the defense. Goalkeeper Chen Shao was alone and unable to defend, suffering a painful loss. Finally, Chen Jiaqiu scored another goal. In the first half, Zhenru scored four goals, and Youyou scored zero. In the second half, Youyou was exhausted, and their strength was greatly reduced. Zhenru, on the other hand, was full of energy and free to move around. At first, they fought hard for ten minutes, and the score remained tied. After that, it was like a river bursting its banks, unstoppable. No matter how the entire army lined up in the defense zone and defended carefully, it was difficult to resist the opponent's elite invasion. In the last thirty-five minutes, Zeng Rongzhong scored one goal, Tong Rongwen scored two goals, and Dai Linjing scored five goals, for a total of eight goals. As a result, Zhenru won with a score of twelve to zero. The referee was He Chunhui.</p>

<h3>Lin Baohua Wins in Tianjin Competition</h3>
<p>Won Both Singles and Doubles... Defeated Tianjin Champion Da Lunqiang</p>
<p>(Tianjin Special Dispatch) Chinese tennis star Lin Shihua responded to the invitation of the Tianjin tennis community and took the Tianjin Maru north at the end of September, arriving in Tianjin on October 4. Representatives of the Tianjin Tennis Association, Zhou Jingfu, Tao Shichun, and Tianjin tennis champion Da Lunqiang, etc., went to the Dalian Wharf to greet him. Mr. Lin disembarked at 6:00 p.m. and stayed at Mr. Ye's residence at No. 3 Shude Lane. On the 5th and 6th, he played as a guest player. In total, Lin won singles with six to three, seven to five against Fei Bo. He also defeated Tianjin champion Da Lunqiang with six to ○, six to one, five to seven, one to six, six to three. In the doubles match, Lin teamed up with Zhou Jingfu and won against Wei Tuomoa and Da Lunqiang with six to four, four to six, six to one, six to four, eight to six. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(1) Doubles: Lin Baohua and Zhou Jingfu 6-4, 6-6, 8; Wei Tuomoa and Da Lunqiang; Lin Baohua vs. the match of the Western Tennis Association was held at the British field at 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th. There were about two hundred spectators, mostly members of the Western Tennis Association and many students. In the afternoon, Mr. Lin and Zhou Jingfu went to the field to practice. Although they had traveled a long distance, they had had sufficient rest, so they were not very tired. After a little practice, the notary, Mr. Smis, announced the start of the game. Thus, the doubles match between Lin Zhou and Lunqiang and Wei Tuomoa began.</p>
<p>In the first game of the first set, Lin served the ball like an arrow, worthy of a master. The posture was also excellent and could serve as a model. After several strong strokes, they won the first game. At the beginning of the second game, Lin Zhou found out the enemy's weakness and instantly created a score of five to three. During the third game, Mr. Lin had a counterattack, and the landing point was excellent. Lunqiang was unable to return in time and lost. The last game was also a quick win. As a result, Lin Zhou won the first set with six to four.</p>
<p>After the start of the second set, Lin Zhou took the upper hand and won two consecutive games. Weaknesses were seen in the third and fourth games, and Lunqiang won with strong strokes. In the fifth game, Mr. Lin served very well, and the opponent's return ball was weak, resulting in defeat. However, in the sixth, seventh, and eighth games, Mr. Zhou hit the ball high and close to the net, resulting in three consecutive losses and ultimately being unrecoverable. In the second set, Lin Zhou lost six to four.</p>
<p>After the second set, both sides reorganized. Lin, seeing the failure of the second set, used all his strength to compete. Lunqiang was forced to jump up with both feet due to Lin's fierce strokes, defending in the air, causing the audience to laugh silently. The Lunqiang group only won the third game. As a result of this set, Lin Zhou won with six to one.</p>
<p>After the third set, both sides went to the tennis club to rest and had some refreshments to boost their energy. After going to the field, Lin Zhou took advantage of the momentum of winning the third set and won again with six to four.</p>
<p>After the start of the fifth set, Lunqiang had already reached the end of his strength and was unable to resist. However, Lin Zhou also showed signs of fatigue, resulting in a stalemate for as long as fourteen games before the victory was decided. As a result, Lin Zhou won again with eight to six. In total, Lin Zhou won the doubles with a score of four to one.</p>
<h3>(2) Singles...Lin Baohua 6-3, 7-5 Fei Bo</h3>
<p>Brief Comment on Ball Skills: Looking at the competition on this day, there were many advantages and disadvantages. Judging from the individual, Mr. Lin's backhand seemed to be slightly weaker, but his forehand shots were excellent. The selection of landing points was particularly appropriate. It was indeed much improved compared to previous years. Zhou Jingfu accompanied Shi Changli to the Far East Games in 1924, and his ball skills were also considerable. However, when defending, he returned high balls too close to the net, which was often calculated by the enemy. This was his weakness. Da Zhenqiang was very stable and his backhand was particularly good. Wei Tuomoa was slightly weaker. Fei Bo's shots were very good, but the landing point was not outstanding.</p>
<p>(3) Singles...Lin Baohua 6-○, 6-1, 5-7, 1-6, 6-3 Da Lunqiang</p>
<p>The second tennis match for Lin Baohua's visit to Tianjin was held at the British field again at 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 6th. The weather was excellent, suitable for ball games, so more Chinese and foreign men and women came to watch the game than last time, about 400 people. One singles and one doubles match were originally scheduled to be played on this day. Unexpectedly, in the singles match, in the sixth game of the fifth set, when the score was two to zero, Mr. Lin suffered from leg disease due to the long game, and blisters appeared on the soles of his feet. In addition, he had undergone an excessive game the day before, which lasted about three hours, and he felt tired both mentally and physically, so his legs ached and he fell to the ground. After being carried to the tennis club and rescued in many ways, he recovered and barely finished the game. As a result, he won with a score of three to two. The mixed doubles performance was not performed due to the advice of Dr. Kaihua, and Da Lunqiang replaced him to form a team with Ms. Liang. As a result, Xia Kai and Wei's team won with a score of two to zero.</p>
<p>Brief Comment on Ball Skills: Looking at the battle on the 6th, Mr. Lin's personal technique was excellent. His forehand shot was fast and powerful, and the landing point was difficult to capture, which could be taken as a model. His mind was clear, and he was not fooled by the opponent's wrong balls, which was his characteristic. The counterattack was still not good, and the high ball near the net was powerless to press down, which was often taken advantage of by the enemy. I hope Mr. Lin will study these two points further to seek further improvement. The rest of the serve was perfect. Lunqiang's ball was very clever, able to know himself and the enemy, and win with intelligence rather than strength, worthy of being Tianjin's first-class master.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the Grand Boy Scout Review in the City</h3>
<p>—Yun Sun</p>
<p>This spring, Boy Scouts from various places were summoned to Nanjing by the Chinese Boy Scout Headquarters in the capital for a review. Today, on the Double Tenth National Day of the nineteenth year, there is another review far and wide. The Shanghai City Training Department decided in advance to gather at the Daji Road Sports Field to conduct a large-scale review. The ceremony was extremely grand, and the newspapers of the 12th have already reported on it. Now, I will pick up some trivial matters from the meeting to tell the readers of this column. I live close to the venue and arrived very early. The rostrum was set up in the west corner of the field, and there were few people. The Minister of the Municipal Training Department, Tong Xingbai, had already calmly taken his seat and was directing the work, looking very diligent. The first to report was the Patriotic Boy Scout Regiment and a certain Western music band. The latest seemed to be the Boy Scout Regiment of Guanghua on Daxi Road. The girl scouts with the most members were the Liangjiang and Southeast regiments, followed by the Chinese Women's Physical Education. Among the boy scouts, the Jinan had the most members, and the Shangzheng Society had the fewest. Some won with the color and quality of their uniforms, and some excelled in their skilled maneuvers. However, they were all equally happy and celebratory. The regimental banners fluttered in the wind, shining with the blue sky and white sun. The scenery was like a painting. A total of more than 3,000 Boy Scouts reported. Each regiment, if accompanied by Western music, was even more solemn and still in spirit. Before the ceremony began, I was worried that the Boy Scouts and the audience were too mixed up and chaotic. But in a moment, the Boy Scouts showed their skills. They connected wooden sticks in order to form a long array, using an encircling formation to ask the audience to retreat. In less than five minutes, the order was restored. Looking around, all that could be seen standing upright in the open field were the yellow troops with high spirits and martial attitudes. Then, they saluted in order. After the ceremony, the commander led the chairman and representatives of the agencies to review each regiment. The entire field was lined up in several rows. The reviewing gentlemen walked around each row. After the review, they gave speeches. The long words are not recorded, but they were all relevant and to the point. It was originally scheduled for the entire team to set off on a parade, but because it was late, each team dispersed. Starting at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon, there were variety show performances. The most special was the lookout post of the Dongya Physical Education School, which was an extremely difficult Boy Scout activity. It was two feet high and took only a few minutes. Its agility was commendable. The rest were the usual variety show performances, which are briefly described and not written in detail.</p>
<h3>Hao Shouchun's Sai Taisui</h3>
<p>—Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>The night before last, I dined with the Jingjiao master Hao Shouchun at the Huibinlou, chatting and enjoying ourselves. Shouchun's arguments were mostly based on his personality of loving good and hating evil, and his expositions were profound, which was deeply consistent with the four famous proverbs that he always strives to encourage himself: read good books, do good deeds, say good words, and be a good person. This must be due to the power of worshiping Christianity. I listened to his remarks and realized that he wanted to use the two old plays, "Examining Li Qi" and "Eliminating the Three Evils", to be renovated, adding beginnings and ends, and going all out to satirize the world and encourage people to be brave in correcting their mistakes. It can truly expand the Christian spirit of universal love. Exemplication is immeasurable. How can he be ignored because he is a court jester?</p>
<p>"Eliminating the Three Evils" is a historical event in Yujin, when Zhou Xiaohou shot a tiger and slashed a dragon. The matter is recorded in history and is well known to many people, so I won't go into details again. "Examining Li Qi" is also known as "Bai Ling Ji". Shouchun changed it to "Sai Taisui". The plot is excellent and is a good material for historical novels. Because few people know the outline, I will write it down later.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, there was a chivalrous thief named Li Qi (or it is said that Li Qi was a mistake for Li Qi), who was fierce and brave, so he had the nickname of Sai Taisui. Because he failed to avenge his father, he angrily joined the green forest and ran rampant without hindrance. His reputation was far-reaching. When he burned and looted the mansion of the greedy official Bao, he was caught and brought to justice. During the trial, he suddenly falsely accused the scholar Wang Liang of being an accomplice. It turned out that Li and Wang had fought each other in the hook column because of jealousy, so he harbored hatred and climbed to frame him. The official arrested Liang. Li recalled that Wang had once kicked him in the leg, and he had torn off his boot, revealing the white silk lining of his leg. He immediately used this as evidence. The official was deceived by him and tortured Wang Liang. Wang was unable to withstand the torture with his weak body and confessed falsely. Li Qi continued to abuse him in prison. Wang could only cry out in vain. One day, Li and Wang were ordered to be escorted. Wang's virtuous wife and loyal servant went to the Changting Pavilion to say goodbye. Li witnessed the tragedy of Wang being falsely accused and his family being separated. His conscience was aroused. He was willing to free Wang from prison to wash away his past sins. However, he also hated Wang for abandoning his beautiful wife and indulging in smoke and flowers, which led to this disaster. The reason was not smooth. He directly rebuked him to warn him of his playfulness. (Shouchun has a long speech in this section, which is smooth and vivid. It is no different from a stick warning to a prodigal son. It is useful for admonishing the world and satirizing customs.) During the retrial, Li overturned his previous confession and vindicated Wang. Later, he was released during an amnesty. Li later reformed himself and served in the military. Because he suppressed pirates, he made great achievements and was finally rewarded. Heaven's reward for good deeds is also generous. There are more than ten folds in this play. Today, only the seven Changting have not been lost. There are more whites than arias in the play. Shouchun is in charge of it, which is refreshing and pleasant. His handling is smooth and there is more than enough to offer, which is indeed a masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Minor Discussions</h3>
<p>— He Zhushi</p>
<p>To cultivate an excellent nation, one must first pay attention to the aestheticization of national life. Although our country is a nation with early cultural enlightenment, class concepts have been deeply rooted for thousands of years. Aesthetized living is not something that the aristocracy pays attention to. The masses, apart from their mechanical work and rest, have absolutely no concept of so-called "aesthetized" living.</p>
<p>"Aestheticization of national life" encompasses a great deal and is very complex. Now, let's highlight the two most important aspects: attire and architecture. Both are capable of entirely expressing the spirit and culture of a nation, representing its vigor and brilliance.</p>
<p>In the Chinese society that has become distorted by the clash of new and old ideas, those with old ideas say that in these times when China's industries are withering and the people are suffering from poverty, even if the aestheticization of the people's lives reaches its peak and everyone becomes an aesthetician, it will not help. Moreover, what's the point of discussing meticulous clothing? This view is mistaken.</p>
<p>We are not advocating extravagance when we talk about improving attire. Because the beauty of attire is pure beauty; it's not necessarily "worth a thousand pieces of gold" to be beautiful attire. We only need to imagine: we admire the beautiful attire of other countries, but we say that the attire of our own uncivilized ethnic groups is (inferior and barbaric). Human perspectives are the same around the world. Therefore, it is necessary to improve Chinese attire, even if we can't talk about the aestheticization of national life for the time being.</p>
<p>Currently, Chinese men cannot escape the style of robes and mandarin jackets; at most, they change to Western suits. But women are different; they change styles repeatedly, creating strange and bizarre looks. Who knows how many styles they've changed, but in the end, it's still "unfathomable." Now, the ones that can be considered the mainstay are the Manchu-style qipao and Westernized clothing.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the first major city in the country, the lives of the people are superficially more prosperous, and attire is also more meticulous. There are also many new-style clothing stores. However, I cannot acknowledge those new clothing stores that create bizarre and impure attire as perfect.</p>
<p>The Da Xin Silk and Brocade Store at the corner of Shilu and Sanma Road is an innovative store. Its emergence can be said to be in line with the needs of the new era. And their specially established New Attire Department can be said to have emerged to meet the needs of the new era. Its strengths lie in the fact that its style concept is rich in the elegance of Eastern culture and the smooth spirit of Western culture, avoiding monotony in tranquility and eliminating triviality in splendor. Moreover, I greatly admire their technicians; their skills are very skilled and they have creative talent. They can create modernized new attire according to the figure of women. That is not an easy task. I can't help but praise Da Xin's new attire as "truly beautiful and good."</p>
<p>Acknowledgement and Introduction: Mr. Shen Shijia from Wulin's paintings are vigorous and unconstrained by various established methods. Recently, he accepted the invitation of the China Fine Arts Society to publish eight pages of his recent landscape paintings on fans for wider circulation. Yesterday, I received a copy as a gift. After browsing through it, it was as if Zong Shaowen had obtained the medicine for lying down and traveling. I hereby express my gratitude. (Shou Juan)</p>
<h3>Impressions of Belgium (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>1.  The Fiftieth Anniversary Museum of Belgium. This museum is located in Brussels and is a monument to the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Belgium, as well as a great architectural structure. In the center is a memorial arch, with art exhibition halls on the left and right. The museum is situated on a plateau, offering views of the boulevards stretching for more than ten Chinese miles in both directions. The form of the memorial arch is quite similar to the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany. The weather was that of early autumn, with the leaves shading the sky. The cleanliness of the streets of Brussels is at its best here. Public exhibitions are held on Sundays, without admission fees. The left hall displays more than four thousand pieces of famous sculptures from various countries. There are few originals; most are reproductions. However, all of the world's famous sculptures are included. Michelangelo's famous work from the Italian Renaissance, (Twilight), which is over three zhang tall, also has a reproduction displayed inside. The arrangement of the hall is excellent, and each country has explanatory reference books, allowing viewers to consult the diagrams. Each work is numbered for convenient inspection. The right hall displays ancient art from various countries, with the most ancient artifacts from Greece, Rome, Egypt, China, and India. There are ten Egyptian mummies in stone coffins, all of which are artifacts from two thousand years ago. Ancient coins from various Chinese dynasties are displayed in one room, with a large number of them. At the entrance to the museum, there is a model of the Sphinx and the Pyramids, along with detailed French instructions distributed to visitors. All of the artifacts in both halls were purchased by the Belgian royal family at great expense, worth millions of gold. European countries all value art, especially historical artifacts. Since the European war, Belgium has built several new art exhibition halls in Brussels. The state has taken the utmost responsibility for promoting art. Art is the darling of culture. To understand a country's culture, one should study its art. Recalling that such a large China does not have a national museum or art gallery is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>2.  Waterloo: When I was young, I learned about the name Waterloo in geography class. The day after arriving in Brussels, I took a trip to Waterloo. Waterloo is fifty Chinese miles from Brussels. First, I took a city tram to the central station, and then I transferred to an suburban tram. After an hour's ride, I reached my destination. After getting off the tram, I saw a five-pointed earthen mountain standing straight in the middle of a plain, towering into the clouds, with a monument vaguely visible on top. The Belgian I was traveling with said that this is the tower commemorating Napoleon's soldiers of that year. After walking about one Chinese mile, I reached the foot of the mountain. Following the tourists, I climbed the earthen mountain. The mountain has a slope, but it is not very wide. From the ground to the top, there are two hundred and twenty-five steps. The top is square, with a stone monument in the center. On top stands a lion, symbolizing heroism. Looking around from the top, the plain is endless, with only a yellow-green expanse swaying in the wind, like water waves. Recalling Napoleon, who won every battle and dominated Europe, steep cliffs were not difficult for him, but the flat ground became the place of the hero's defeat. While touring the top, I felt smaller. I took two photos and went down the mountain to the War Memorial Hall. The hall is next to the earthen mountain. I guessed that what was displayed in the hall must be war equipment. I bought a ticket and entered the hall. Inside, there was a circular space over ten zhang wide, covered with a cloth curtain, making it difficult to see things clearly. Looking around from the platform, I saw battle flags densely arranged, cannon fire continuous, and troops fighting fiercely. The horses did not stop. It was a truly shocking and stunning great battle.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (292)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain the Lady's Heartbroken Face, Red Lotus Fragrance Fades as the Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Just as Cuiyun was talking about that part, they heard the sound of the bell at the window. The assistant downstairs shouted, "Third Miss, someone surnamed Xie is requesting a song 'A Family's Spring.'" At that time, Cuiyun was peeling crab, and the tips of her fingers were covered with crab roe. She said to the little maid in the room, "Go fetch a basin of cold water and pick a few chrysanthemum leaves so I can wash my hands before going. Otherwise, my hands will be full of the fishy smell of crab." She then said to Zuo Shichen, "Second Young Master, wait for me to sing a song and then come back to continue telling you the story, okay? You'll be eating for a while anyway." Zuo Shichen said, "Why don't you finish telling this story before you go? Hearing it makes people sad, but you're acting like a storyteller teasing the audience, or like someone writing a serial novel, 'If you want to know what happens next, listen to the next chapter.'" Cuiyun said, "I'm afraid I'll miss the opportunity to sing." Zuo Shichen said, "Even if you're singing somewhere else, you'd still have to go. Just keep it simple and finish telling this part of the story. How exactly did Hong Lianxiang die?" Cuiyun said, "It's not that simple. When telling a story, you always have to explain the cause. When Lianxiang first married, it was made clear that she would live outside. Master Yin said, 'We have quite a few houses in Shanghai anyway, whether in the British Concession or the French Concession. Just pick an empty house to occupy for a year. It doesn't have to be too big; a two-story house will be enough.' According to Lianxiang's wishes, since she was marrying into the family, she said that even a one-story house would be fine. If there are fewer people, there won't be too many rooms either. But Master Yin thought that a one-story house wouldn't look good. He said that if they thought the house was too big, they could rent the downstairs to someone else, so that they could occupy one floor and have someone to look after the place a bit. At that time, he entrusted his rental agent to keep a two-unit house. But all the arrangements were kept secret from the tigress at home. Not only was it kept secret from the tigress, but it was also kept secret from everyone in the family. Because that Mrs. Yin was really smart. If the family knew, they would inevitably reveal it. She was able to observe people's words and expressions, just like a good interrogator in court. She could scare or trick the criminals into confessing everything. Before Lianxiang married Master Yin, although some people said that Mrs. Yin was a formidable character, when they asked Master Yin, he absolutely denied it. Some people also said, 'If you want to discuss marrying a concubine with your wife, that's impossible. Not only will the concubine not be married, but the family will quarrel so much that it will be a mess.' So the gentlemen nowadays don't do that kind of foolish thing anymore. Nowadays, gentlemen use a 'shoot first, ask questions later' method. They think that no matter how big the matter is, it can't be resolved. At first, they hide it from the family and hide the concubine outside. Later, the family gradually finds out, and what's done is done. The raw rice has been cooked. They just have to accept it; there's no other way."</p>

<h3>Key Points of the Gold Market Last Week</h3>
<p>The Market Turned from Strong to Flat with No Major Changes</p>
<p>Speculative Fever Subsided with Very Few Wholesale Transactions</p>
<p>A Lingering Situation: The gold market situation last week was strong and then weakened. However, it coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Double Tenth National Day celebrations, and the market was closed. Therefore, there were only four trading days during the week. At the beginning of the week, the price briefly broke through the 570 tael mark. After that, it weakened again. However, the turmoil was relatively calm, with only 4-5 tael of fluctuation per day, and people were somewhat uncertain. It was a situation of consolidation. As the exchange date approached, short sellers had to cover their positions, and many had already hedged their positions. As for the transactions in the past few days, there were no large overseas silver markets. The overseas silver market rose slightly, and the gold price reached 574.5 taels on Tuesday (October 7). By the weekend (October 11), it had suddenly fallen to 563.2 taels, a difference of 11.2 taels between the high and low. The peaceful trend was due to the lack of special news overseas. As a result, the price ended at 65.7 taels, only 1.3 taels higher than the previous Saturday. The exchange's transaction volume has recently been around 50,000 contracts. As for large silver bars, the premium increased by 0.0625 (with 25 fluctuations), and the silver price also increased by 0.125 (with 0.375 differences). HSBC's listing price increased by 0.25, and the Japanese exchange rate decreased by 0.0125. However, the transaction prices of various banks were not significantly different. The gold price was about 50 taels lower than the settlement price on the exchange. The spot red bars were selling well, so the price did not change, remaining around 16 taels, which was added to the forward price. The general situation of the week is listed below:</p>
<p>A Steady Process: On October 7, the opening price of the November gold contract was 4.8 mace higher, at 569.2 taels. The premium on large silver bars on the 6th had fallen by 0.125, and the silver price had decreased by 0.25. On the 7th, the silver bar premium decreased by another 0.0625, and the silver price did not change. Therefore, the market sentiment was still good. HSBC's listing price did not change, and the domestic market was tight. Brokers were busy settling their positions. Later, buyers were active and covered their short positions, so the price broke through the 570 tael mark, reaching 574.5 taels in the afternoon. By the close, it had fallen back by more than 2 taels, to 572 taels. The fluctuation that day was 7.4 mace. The next day, the premium on large bars returned, and the exchange rate remained flat. The gold market weakened again. The opening price fell by 3 mace. Later, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Changyong, and Kangyong all bought in, causing the price to rise. As Shunli, Zhifeng, and Yongyong sold off, the exchange market eased, and the price broke back into the 570 tael mark. The fluctuations were only about 4 mace. The Dalian group was hedging the premium, so they were buying the premium and selling the silver bars, about 30 taels away from the initial price. On Thursday, the premium on silver bars increased by 0.0625. The premium remained unchanged. The domestic market seemed loose, so the gold price was initially firm, reaching 570 taels. Later, major players Yuansheng, Yongheng, Shengda, etc. sold off, causing a sharp drop of 5 taels to below 565 taels. The market ended at over 66 taels. The increase for the whole day was 5.3 mace. However, the supply from fellow brokers was excessive, and market sentiment weakened. Friday was the Double Tenth holiday, and the market was closed. However, the premium on large bars increased by 0.125, and the silver price increased by 0.375. By the weekend (October 11), the silver bar premium continued to increase, and the silver price remained unchanged. However, the European market was stable, and the United States seemed to be selling, so the opening price of gold was slightly lower, at 64.2 taels. As there were more sellers, the price fell to 63.2 taels. Later, although the premium increased slightly, the domestic market was still flat. Hengxing, Shengda, Yuancheng, Yongfu, Changyuan, and Maoyong all bought in, recovering 1.2-3 taels. As a result, the market closed at 65.7 taels. After the close, transactions continued outside the market at over 66 taels, and the market sentiment was good. Therefore, the market situation became more moderate. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as exchange rates and gold prices, are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Silver Dollar Market Is Traditionally Slack</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Every Sunday, the Shanghai financial community is closed due to the bank's day off. Although the money houses still operate as usual, they are still limited, so the weather is very hanging in this situation. In the future, the market will be on Sunday, or there may be a fact that the whole is closed. As for market prices, only the silver demolition is tighter, and the rest is stable, and the transaction situation is also very rare. Only Zhongshan new currency goes to the stomach and surged again, and the water is also half strong.</p>
<p>The early market price of one dollar is seven cents, two cents, seven cents and a half, and the noon market is seven cents, two cents, seven cents and two and a half cents. As a result, it is slightly smaller than the early market of the previous day by half a cent, and "one silver demolition" is one cent and six cents in the early and noon markets, which is more than one cent better than the previous day, and the situation is also suddenly tightened. The bank is closed and the linings are not circulated.</p>
<p>The early market for auxiliary coins in Jiangnan Xiaoyang is six cents, four cents and eight cents, and the noon market is six cents, four cents and six and a half cents, which seems to be a little better than the previous day, and the early market is 7,000 corners, and the noon market is 1,000 corners. The early market for Guangdong Xiaoyang is six cents, three cents and seven cents and a half, and the noon market is also six cents, three cents and seven cents and a half. 165,000 corners and 45,000 corners of copper yuan are reduced by 500 to 388,500.</p>
<p>The value of yesterday's silver dollar was the bank's settlement with no news. The money house and the silver public collected more than 37 million yuan, and the ocean public collected 3.45 million yuan. Each road collected more than 200,000 yuan, and the amount of money allocated in the market was 565,000 in the early market and 217,000 in the noon market. Only 10,000 banknotes in the noon market and 15,000 outside the market, more than 10 million in small money houses, and more than 300,000 new currencies of Zhongshan were sold. Adding half a cent of water made more than 800,000 customers.</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Rose and Fell Intermittently Last Week</h3>
<p>Except for 96, Other Bonds Are Trending Towards Moderation</p>
<p>Markets Suspended Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival on Monday and National Day on Friday. During the past week, the spot and futures trading of various bonds in the Shanghai Securities Market continued to be scarce. Only 58,500 yuan was issued throughout the week, of which 16,000 yuan was for the Sixth Consolidation Bond and 11,000 yuan for the Disarmament Bond. The other bonds were several thousand yuan each. Although the futures market was slightly more active than before, the market was only open for four days in the entire week due to the Mid-Autumn Festival on Monday and the National Day celebration on Friday. The total transaction volume increased by only 4.7 million yuan, totaling 42.19 million yuan. Among them, Disarmament and Reorganization bonds were more active. The October issue of Disarmament Bond accounted for 7.02 million yuan, the November issue accounted for 8.94 million yuan, the October issue of Reorganization Bond accounted for 6.34 million yuan, and the November issue accounted for 5.3 million yuan. Other bonds remained calm, such as the October issue of Customs Duty Bond accounting for 2.385 million yuan, the November issue accounting for 2.915 million yuan, the October issue of the 19th Year Cigarette Tax Bond accounting for 1.595 million yuan, the November issue accounting for 1.775 million yuan, the Post-Disaster Bond accounting for 1.18 million yuan, with the October issue accounting for 790,000 yuan and the November issue accounting for 390,000 yuan, the Financial Bond accounting for only 120,000 yuan, the 7th Year Bond accounting for 60,000 yuan, the Continuing Cigarette Bond accounting for 15,000 yuan, and the Continuing Second and Fifth Bonds having no market. The 96 Bond has been very calm. Last week, it suddenly traded 2.755 million yuan, with the October issue accounting for 1.26 million yuan and the November issue accounting for 1.495 million yuan. Furthermore, although the 19th Year Customs Duty Treasury Bond was only traded on Saturday, it still had 990,000 yuan, with the October issue accounting for 395,000 yuan and the November issue accounting for 595,000 yuan. As for the changes, due to the stable political situation and the environment of the bond market, there were few changes, so major buyers and sellers did not have huge inflows or outflows. The demand and supply situation was quite balanced, so except for the 96 Bond, the other bonds remained relatively constant, without major changes. The stagnant situation was no different from before. As a result, compared with the previous week, there were intermittent rises and falls. Among them, the futures of Reorganization, Disarmament, and Customs Duty bonds all weakened, but the prices of the 19th Year Cigarette Tax Bond and the Sixth Consolidation Bond all trended firmer, but the amount was small, and the average rise and fall was mostly around half a yuan. However, the long-silent 96 Bond suddenly underwent significant changes last week. On Friday, due to rumors that it could be reorganized, the market sentiment suddenly improved, and the price rose significantly one after another. However, on Saturday afternoon, market sentiment turned weak again and the price fell back. However, the result was still a rise of two yuan and several corners. From the current environment of the bond market, the so-called reorganization of the 96 Bond is probably baseless. Furthermore, the 19th Year Customs Duty Bond with a value of 80 million has already been auctioned at the end of last week, and the future of the bond market can be expected. The statistics of the high, low, rise, and fall of each bond price are listed below (in yuan):</p>

<h3>Gloomy View of Yarn and Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>Due to the three-day market closure for the Autumn Festival and National Day last week, the cotton yarn market situation has changed slightly. In fact, after the holiday, spot yarn sales have been sluggish, and the bottom goods of various factories have inevitably increased. As a result, the Chaozhou gang has been selling off a lot, and the pressure has increased. However, a certain factory has maintained a firm attitude and tightened its grip. Although the political situation has improved, the purchasing power of various roads is still weak due to the exhaustion of vitality. Therefore, market sentiment remains depressed. However, the overseas cotton yarn market situation is quite fluctuating. The market in Shanghai is difficult to improve due to the high base and the dim demand for spot yarn. The future situation depends on the actual sales. Most sellers have to look at the 50 taels into two, and the price of standard yarn has fallen by 1 tael 68 mace compared to the previous week. The standard cotton market situation has become weaker, because the world cotton market is depressed, and both US and Indian cotton are gradually falling. How can local cotton stand alone? Therefore, it has fallen recently. However, most inland gangs have tightened their grip because of the poor harvest year and high local prices. The Han gang is also doing more. However, Indian cotton is sold at very cheap prices, and various factories have fully booked their orders. There is no need for Chinese cotton at all, and all of it has been seized by foreign cotton. The trend of US cotton has slightly improved at the end of the week, but the market situation in Shanghai is quite unstable. The reason is that the previous tightening was not maintained, and the market has now been released during the rise, so the market has fallen back. Dongmian Yangxing, a Japanese merchant, took the opportunity to buy more than 10,000 dan. From a fundamental point of view, the cotton market is weak, but if US cotton rebounds, local cotton may have a temporary rebound. The price of standard cotton has fallen by 67 mace compared to the previous week. The price of standard cotton may rise by 12 mace tomorrow.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Market Turns Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market situation was firm and active due to good news from Liverpool and short positions covering. Futures prices rose by 10 to 15 pounds per tone, and spot prices rose by 15 pounds per tone. English cotton futures rose by 9 points, and spot prices rose by 11 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton brokers bought in. Pin Gwo Er and Aomura rose by 3 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi rose by 5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3>A Glimpse of the U.S. Cotton Relief Organization</h3>
<p>The United States, faced with frequent cotton price drops, is trying to provide relief. The history of its relief policies is briefly outlined below: (1) The Agricultural Marketing Act was enacted in June 1929; (2) In July 1929, the Federal Farm Board was established to implement the aforementioned regulations; (3) In January 1930, the American Cotton Cooperative, the central cotton sales organization, was established; (4) In February 1930, the Cotton Advisory Committee was established; (5) In June 1930, the American Cotton Stabilization Corporation was established. The Agricultural Marketing Act is the fundamental policy of the United States for rural relief, and can generally be referred to as the Rural Relief Act. This act was enacted and promulgated in June 1929 after years of debate between the President and Congress. The act aims to develop the joint sale of agricultural products and establishes three organizations for its implementation: (1) the Federal Farm Board; (2) the Cotton Advisory Committee; and (3) the American Cotton Stabilization Corporation. The organizational system for the cotton industry is as follows:</p>
<p>Agricultural Marketing Act Federal Farm Board Cotton Advisory Committee American Cotton Cooperative (New Cotton) Market American Cotton Stabilization Corporation Old Cotton State Cooperatives Cotton Farmers</p>
<p>Federal Farm Board The Federal Farm Board is the highest controlling body, directly under the President. It is a powerful organization for rural relief, with a circulating capital of 500 million yuan, used to lend to cooperatives and also to fund the Stabilization Corporation. The Board's regular expenses are paid separately by the national treasury. The Board is composed of nine members. In addition to the Minister of Agriculture as an ex officio member, the remaining members are appointed by the President. It is currently headed by Mr. Legge, the general manager of a Chicago farm equipment company, and Mr. Williams, a commentator from Hogge &amp;amp; Herlach.</p>
<p>American Cotton Cooperative The policies of the Federal Farm Board are implemented by the Cooperative. This cooperative is organized by fourteen state cooperatives as a 30 million yuan joint-stock company. The share allocation is based on the amount of cotton handled by each state cooperative, with one share added for every hundred bales and each share worth one hundred yuan. The Cooperative's headquarters are in New Orleans, with seventeen domestic sales offices and fifteen overseas. The current president is Mr. Auden, the head of the Alabama Cotton Cooperative. The vice president and secretary-general is Mr. Mottice, the president of the Cotton Exchange. The general manager is Mr. Creek. The details of the Cooperative are listed below: (A) Main tasks: (1) It is organized for the convenience and strengthening of local cooperatives; (2) The Farm Board may lend money to state cotton cooperatives through the central cooperative in the following circumstances: (a) Loans to cotton farmers when trading cotton; (b) Loans for the construction of warehouses, packing plants, or cotton gins; (c) Loans to state cooperatives when soliciting members; (d) Loans to state cooperatives when issuing shares in production finance companies; (3) Assist in the joint sale of cotton, guide the mutual assistance of state cooperatives, and liaise with banks and commercial organizations; (4) Harmonize American cotton production with world needs; (5) Buy and sell spot or futures on the market when necessary; (6) Find ways to assist in improving the quality of American cotton; (7) Sometimes undertake the mission of the Stabilization Corporation (note: the Stabilization Corporation has been established separately); (B) Affairs handled after establishment: (1) Buy old cotton in the futures market to maintain cotton prices. The Federal Farm Board originally had no intention of maintaining the market price of old cotton, but was forced to do so by Congress. From late April to mid-June, it purchased about one million bales of May and July futures. Afterwards, the American Cotton Stabilization Corporation took over its responsibilities. According to reports, from April 25 to June 14, it had lost 13 million yuan due to the drop in cotton prices; (2) In late August, it decided to lend money to each state</p>
<p>cooperative, approximately 90% of the market price, while each state cooperative bought cotton from farmers who joined as members and lent 70% to 90% of the price at the same time. After the sale, it deducted handling fees and paid the full amount. The Farm Board's loans are lent to the state cooperatives.</p>
<p>Cotton Advisory Committee When the Federal Farm Board believes that the cotton market is in a very abnormal state, it convenes state cooperatives to form an advisory committee composed of seven members to decide whether to establish a Stabilization Corporation. The committee was established in March of this year based on Article 3 of the Agricultural Marketing Act, and at a meeting in mid-May, it decided to establish the American Cotton Stabilization Corporation (if not established separately,</p>
<p>the American Cotton Cooperative may also perform its duties).</p>
<p>Cotton Stabilization Corporation The Corporation was established by the Advisory Committee in accordance with Article 9 of the Agricultural Marketing Act and was formally established on June 5. The Corporation is a non-stock and for-profit company. Its capital should be paid by the Farm Board at the request of the Advisory Committee. In the current situation, its needs should be more than 50 million yuan. If there are losses, the Farm Board is responsible. The purpose of the Corporation is to buy surplus goods of old cotton from 1929, which is unrelated to new cotton. The 1.3 million bales of old cotton purchased by state cooperatives will be taken over by the Stabilization Corporation. The Stabilization Corporation is also in New Orleans. The president and general manager is Mr. Creek, the general manager of the American Cotton Cooperative.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Bowl Green Opens Well</h3>
<p>The Japanese sugar market is experiencing a shortage of top-grade goods, leading to price increases. Yesterday's sugar market saw no telegrams from the production areas due to the weekend. The buying interest in the Association's raw and white sugar remained quiet, but the outflow was still strong. The transaction price for new goods reached 7 taels and 950 cash, with slightly higher ones at 8 taels, but the volume was not large. The market price fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, and the market sentiment was weak. Finely ground white sugar was priced at 8 taels, 20# medium white sugar was at 7 taels and 450 cash, with little demand. 8# Dutch brown sugar was at 6 taels and 250 cash, and 9# was at 6 taels and 300 cash. The market sentiment was also flat. The Japanese sugar market sentiment was firm, and trading was active. The top-grade goods were in short supply, leading to an increase of 5 fen. N Mark was priced at 7 taels and 950 cash, YT Mark at 7 taels and 800 cash, TK at 7 taels and 850 cash, and top-grade J Mark at 8 taels, 150 cash to 8 taels, 175 cash. YP Mark was at 8 taels and 100 cash. The market sentiment was firm. The hao pan had Hua Xin Hao selling over 1,000 bags of newly opened bowl green at a price of 6 taels, and the market was quite brisk.</p>
<h3>Hardware Industry to Discuss Price Increases Today</h3>
<p>Since the foreign exchange rate has been rising, the hardware market has been gradually loosening due to the large amount of inventory and the underlying fatigue among the dealers. Based on the latest market prices, there are losses in the cost of goods. Therefore, the Iron Industry Association has initiated a price increase. The proposal was approved by the general meeting yesterday and will be discussed starting this afternoon. As a result, there is bound to be a major change in the market price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Filature Products Alone Rise Last Week</h3>
<p>European firms seize the opportunity to hoard... Futures rise by twenty to thirty taels.  The number of silk filatures in Jiangsu and Zhejiang that are suspending operations is increasing... The future remains difficult to be optimistic. Although the price of Shanghai white filature products rose last week, only hoarding and digestion improved slightly. Actual sales in Europe and the United States remained sluggish. European firms, seeing the strike of Shanghai silk filatures and the indefinite resumption of work, began to hoard futures. Manufacturers, with insufficient inventory, estimated that the amount of silk and raw materials in stock at the filatures would not meet the demand of Europe and the United States for two to three months, and the cost of silk was not low. Therefore, they were willing to sell only when prices rose. As a result, the transaction volume last week was difficult to improve. The New York economy in the overseas market showed increasing signs of decline, and the stock market remained depressed. The silk market showed no signs of recovery, and silk prices continued to decline. In Lyon, affected by the low price of Japanese silkworm cocoons, although the French exchange rate rose, the price of Chinese silk fell both openly and secretly. Silk sales in London also showed no signs of recovery. Spot sales of Japanese silk in Yokohama remained sluggish. However, due to the purchase of long-term hoarders, silk prices rose by twenty to thirty yen. The number of silk filatures in Jiangsu and Zhejiang that were suspending operations due to losses increased, totaling more than 180 filatures. It is estimated that 70% of silk filatures are currently suspended. Government relief funds are indefinitely delayed. The future of the silk market is becoming increasingly bleak. Last week, only more than 200 bales of filature futures were traded, and prices rose by twenty to thirty taels. Spot sales of other silk products were sluggish, and prices did not change much. Current silk exports are over 600 bales.</p>

<h3>Rice Market</h3>

<h3>Silk Filature Industry Opened a Representative Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Relief Committee Will Be Formed. Shanghai silk filature operators, due to the depressed sales of silk by foreign firms, high silk costs and low selling prices, and the complete depletion of funds, are unable to maintain operations. Of the 106 silk filatures in Shanghai, eight or nine out of ten have been forced to suspend operations. The operators have repeatedly convened meetings to discuss relief measures and have jointly resolved to submit a request to the government to issue 5 million yuan in silk industry public bonds, which has been approved by Zhang Shouyong, Vice Minister of Finance, for further submission. Subsequently, the silk filature operators in Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Huzhou, and Jiaxing all stated that the sluggish silk sales in Europe and the United States had reached an extreme point, and the depression of the inland silk filature industry was in the same state as that of the Shanghai operators. Suspensions of operations followed one after another, and they sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Silk Filature Operators Association, requesting to join forces, jointly submitting a request to the government to request an additional 10 million yuan in silk industry public bonds in order to achieve universal relief. The cocoon merchants in the Jiangzhe provinces who were on the verge of collapse also dispatched responsible representatives to Shanghai to work together. Yesterday (12th) at 3:00 pm, the Shanghai Silk Filature Operators Association held a meeting of representatives of the Jiangzhe silk filature industry. Those who arrived from Shanghai included Shen Huachen, Huang Jinzhen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Yunsheng, and others, totaling seven people. Those from Wuxi included Cheng Bingruo, Qian Fenghao, Zhang Zizhen, Yang Yuchu, Xue Shouhuan, and others, totaling five people. All were unable to attend due to train delays. Those from Jiangzhe included Li Youren (absent), Zhu Mouxiang. Jiang Lanxian and other three people, publicly elected Shen Huachen to preside over the meeting. Due to the absence of representatives from Wuxi, a discussion was held instead. First, the chairman stated the situation of the previous visit to Finance Vice Minister Zhang by representatives Zhu and Huang to discuss the situation. Next, the representatives decided to submit a request to the government to issue 10 million yuan in Jiangzhe silk filature industry relief public bonds, to be repaid in installments over six years, and to be drawn and allocated when filature silk is exported. In addition, fifteen representatives from various regions were organized into a Jiangzhe silk filature industry relief committee, responsible for actively carrying out the program. It was resolved that the above provisional measures would be finalized at a general meeting to be held at 3:00 pm tomorrow (i.e., today) on the 13th, with representatives from Wuxi in attendance, for a public vote. The meeting adjourned after the discussion, at 7:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Organization of Zhejiang Cocoon Merchants into the United Association of Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Guilds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's First Preparatory Meeting of the United Association of Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Guilds: Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the first preparatory meeting of the United Association of Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Guilds was held at the Zhejiang Guild in Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII. Over twenty representatives from various districts attended. The details of the meeting and resolutions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the representatives from various counties arrived by train from Zhejiang Province. They included Huang Weisan and Hu Jinbei from Pinghu; Chen Shanqin, Ni Beizheng, Pan Jinglan, Pan Zexuan, Chen Jingxian, Chen Changxian, Jiang Lanxian, Chen Menghui, Zhang Ximin, and Shen Yijun from Jiaxing; Xu Suikang and Yu Caibo from Jiashan; Wang Lianfang from Chongde; Yu Shouchang, Yu Zhisan, and Zhong Bosun from Hai'ning; Zhang Youyi from Haiyan; Shen Tianxin and Zhao Jiexiang from Huzhou; Ma Yiqun from Ji'an; and Chen Xikun from Jiangsu, among others.</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Meeting: Due to train delays, representatives from various regions did not arrive until around 3 PM. Mr. Jiang Lanxian was elected as chairman. He reported on the attendance, which met the quorum requirement, and read the previous session's resolutions. He then stated that the General Association of Silk Cocoon Merchants of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui had secretly arranged with Japanese cocoon merchants to purchase Japanese cocoons without the consent or consultation of the Zhejiang cocoon merchants. They even privately petitioned the Ministry of Finance to exempt Japanese cocoons from taxes. Such a significant matter was handled recklessly and outrageously by the General Association. The Zhejiang cocoon merchants could not silently accept this situation. He hoped that all attendees would express their insightful opinions to save the Zhejiang cocoon merchants from their impending doom. Subsequently, attendees continuously expressed their opinions and resolved the following matters for future action: Resolutions (1) Elected Huang Weisan, Chen Menghui, and Chen Jingxian as drafters to draft the association's charter and various official documents. (2) Elected Shen Tianxin, Jiang Lanxian, Yu Zhisan, Zhao Jiexiang, and Chen Jingxian as the five executive preparatory committee members. (3) Preparatory expenses would be temporarily advanced by the cocoon industry guilds of various districts. (4) The second preparatory meeting was scheduled for 2 PM on October 26th, to be held at the Zhejiang Guild. (5) Continued to appoint preparatory members: Zhu Mouxian and Xu Xingbin from Hangzhou; Shen Yijun, Huang Weisan, and Ma Yiqun from Jiaxing; and Yu Baoshu and Xu Yunlai from Huzhou. The meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>National Silk and Satin Exhibition</h3>
<p>Held this afternoon at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The third National Goods Movement Week, organized by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has been promoting national goods to the best of its ability since its opening on the 7th. At the request of the silk and satin industry, a National Silk and Satin Exhibition will be held today (the 13th) starting at 1 PM in the hall of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Guests are welcome to attend freely. It is said that the association has also invited famous artists to perform elegant entertainment to amuse the guests. Silk and satin materials and various exquisite items donated by various factories and shops will be raffled off and awarded on the spot. The closing ceremony of the third National Goods Movement will be held at 4 PM. The order of the meeting is as follows: (1) Opening (all stand at attention) music, (2) singing the party song, (3) paying the highest respects to the party, national flag, and portrait of the late premier, (4) the chairman respectfully reads the late premier's will (silent tribute), (5) chairman's address, (6) speeches, (7) exhibition, (8) entertainment (songs, dances, martial arts, skits, Cantonese songs, national music, etc.).</p>
<p>The silk and satin industry of this city has already been sending their products to the exhibition for display. It is said that the Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau on Shilu Road has dozens of new national silk fabrics and more than ten new-style fashions on display at the exhibition, which are quite distinctive. The Dasheng and Dalun silk and satin bureaus on Nanjing Road also sent many silk materials to the exhibition. Mrs. Liu, the supervisor, Mrs. Zhang, the mayor, Mrs. Pan, the director, and Mrs. Wang Yansong, the initiators of the Women's Association for Promoting National Goods, are also expected to attend. The declaration of the National Silk and Satin Exhibition of the third National Goods Movement Week in Shanghai is recorded below: Our Chinese nation is founded on agriculture, and silk, a special product, has long enjoyed a high reputation. It is not only universally recognized by Chinese people as the supreme clothing material but also clothes the world, shining globally, and is a major export. However, since countries like Japan and Vietnam impose harsh taxes on Chinese silk, our country's silk trade has lost its inherent advantages. Furthermore, Chinese people are now obsessed with Westernization, plagiarizing foreign styles. They compete to show off in Western suits and leather shoes. Even rickshaw pullers and servants consider it an honor to wear a Western suit. This deeply ingrained habit has led to an increasing import of foreign wool and silk, and the sales of national silk have been almost completely robbed. Silk merchants are suffering losses, farmers and workers are in distress, the trade deficit is increasing annually, and profits are flowing overseas. The lifeblood of the Chinese nation is being sucked dry, and the economic aggression of imperialists is just beginning. Thinking about the future, how can we not be chilled? Fortunately, the National Government has promulgated regulations on clothing, stipulating that the blue gown and black mandarin jacket should be used as formal attire, with national silk as the material. Wang and Wu, the diplomatic leaders, also wear national gowns and mandarin jackets at diplomatic events, showing elegant manners and being praised by the world, indicating that the clothing of a great nation has its immortal value, which is far from comparable to the awkward Western suits. We wonder what the domestic Western suit enthusiasts are thinking. Indeed, the concept of loving beauty is universal, especially among women. Looking at the National Goods Fashion Exhibition held at the Dahua Hotel the other day, the ladies and gentlemen who attended were all wearing national silk, looking graceful, luxurious, and extremely magnificent. Compared with their previous obsession with foreign goods, it is like valuing pebbles over jade. Female compatriots can awaken from this point on. The purpose of this exhibition is that, although the fashion exhibition the other day has awakened people's sentiments, it is still felt that the advantages of national silk have not been fully demonstrated. Therefore, we have specially gathered exquisite national silk from all over the country and displayed it at the exhibition to allow patriotic compatriots to know where to get the materials and to encourage celebrities to give speeches and perform national costume etiquette to promote national goods. Valuable gifts will be distributed to promote harmony, and elegant entertainment will be added to help the fun. At this time, the military situation is settled, unification is expected, and the Double Tenth Festival is celebrated nationwide. It is the day for Chinese people to jointly plan construction and develop national products. It is also the time for us to cheer and enjoy ourselves. Such a grand event is rare, and a good opportunity should not be missed. Patriotic compatriots, why not come!</p>

<h3>Wheat Inspection Issues</h3>
<p>Opinions of the Chinese Grain Merchants Association: The Shanghai Chinese Grain Merchants Association sent a letter to Director Jin of the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining yesterday, stating, "Regarding the issue of wheat inspection, your institute has established temporary measures consisting of eighteen articles. After several meetings of the association and careful discussion based on our existing experience, we have no objection to the principle of rectifying wheat. However, we dare not say that the method of inspecting wheat is perfect. Some requirements are excessively high, some classifications are inappropriate, the procedures vary in complexity, and the target of punishment is inappropriate. In terms of content, it is overly strict, and in practice, there will inevitably be many obstacles. In the future, your institute will find it difficult to achieve consistent implementation, and our association will only increase the fault of failing to comply. This is why we believe that your institute's implementation of the inspection is not feasible.</p>
<p>"It is a well-known saying that 'foundations should be laid in Yunnan.' Your institute's establishment and the new policies you promulgated should be thoroughly consulted and widely visited to ensure thoroughness. If you encounter obstacles that are difficult to implement, do not hesitate to change course. Therefore, we dare to offer this presumptuous statement and respectfully request your director to promptly increase the number of original committee members, expand the organization, and recruit local wheat merchants with rich experience to give them seats. All these implementation measures must be thoroughly discussed, gathering wisdom and benefitting the public, and re-examining them to achieve perfection and eliminate all obstacles, so that great results can be achieved. We hope that you will adopt this humble opinion, as the future of commerce truly depends on it. As for the registration of wheat and the date of implementation of the inspection, please postpone it before these measures have been revised and improved, otherwise, there will be many obstacles and difficulties for wheat merchants." We hereby issue this reply and await your clear instructions.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Investigates Major Harvest Brokerage Licenses</h3>
<p>Wang, the director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, said that as the major harvest season is now underway and cotton has entered the market, all firms have started weighing. However, in various townships, there are cases of unlicensed brokers and the use of one license for two purposes, which result in the loss of national taxes. Therefore, he specifically ordered committee members Wang and Ma to take brokerage clerk Xing Fengxiang to various townships in recent days to investigate the brokerage licenses of each firm and whether there are any malpractices. Once discovered, they will be immediately brought to the bureau and punished according to regulations to increase tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Grain Selling at Lower than Market Price to End Soon</h3>
<p>Selling the Remaining 20,000 Stones of Rice to Rice Stores: At the beginning of this summer, rice prices in Shanghai soared, and there was a shortage of new and old crops. The price of foreign rice at that time rose to 18 or 19 yuan per stone, and it was still expected to rise to 25 yuan. People in Shanghai were panicked. After negotiations between Yu Qiaqing, the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Council, it was decided to sell rice at lower than market prices to help the common people. At that time, it was agreed to purchase 200,000 stones of foreign rice, with a discount of 5 yuan per stone, and to prepare 1 million yuan to subsidize the sales at lower than market prices. After the agreement was reached, funds were raised. The first batch was 1,500 tons of foreign rice purchased from Tianxiang, and the second batch was 3,000 tons, at a price of 7 liang and 5 qian and 7 liang and 7 qian, respectively, per bag of 133 catties. The first batch was sold at lower than market prices from July 21st, and the second batch was sold from August 12th, with discounts of 13 yuan and 14 yuan per stone, respectively. Recently, rice and grain from the Yangtze River have been transported to Shanghai, and new products from the inland have also been launched, with gradually increasing arrivals and falling rice prices. The grain panic has gradually become a thing of the past. The office for selling grain at lower than market price has no need to continue to exist. The committee has now decided to end the sales soon, prepare a report, submit it to the Municipal Government, and announce the situation. The remaining 20,000 stones of foreign rice will be distributed by the association to rice shops in Shanghai to be sold at market prices in order to conclude the sales.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Bar Association</h3>
<p>The 64th meeting of the Shanghai Bar Association was convened at 10:00 AM yesterday (Sunday). Chairman Liu Zuwang presided over the meeting with due ceremony. The proposals are recorded below: (1) The Ministry of Justice returned the documents submitted regarding the qualification of lawyer Hong Shihhao. Resolution: Forward to member Hong Shihhao for reference. (2) The Shanghai Special District Court Prosecutor's order to report the meeting situation has been forwarded. Resolution: File for record. (3) The Shanghai District Court Prosecutor ordered a reply regarding the eleventh additional donation of the Bar Association, inquiring what expenses were being collected and whether approval had been obtained from the Ministry of Justice. Resolution: Investigate and reply by letter. (4) Committee member Tan Yigong reported on the 7th of this month that he contacted the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Lu Lianjiao case, who was hit and killed by an American car.

<h3>Jishenghui's Expressed Gratitude for the Relief Efforts in Liaoning's Flood Disaster</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jishenghui is currently conducting emergency relief efforts in Liaoning's flood disaster, setting up porridge factories in Dachuang and Xiaochuang in Suizhong County, which has been reported earlier. Now, we have received a cable from the Liaoning Flood Disaster Relief Association and the Liaoning Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which states: "To the gentlemen of the Chinese Jishenghui, Ningbo Road, British Concession, Shanghai: We have received and read the cable. Your establishment of two porridge factories in Sui shows your universal compassion, treating all equally. We are grateful for the food and thank you on behalf of the disaster victims. We still earnestly request your assistance to benefit the disaster victims. We look forward to your leadership." It was previously reported by Yang Junzigong, the chairman of the Charity Federation of the four provinces of Feng, Ji, Rehe, and Hei, who came to Shanghai, that the flood disaster in Liaoning Province had affected more than 600,000 people after a personal investigation. In Suizhong County alone, there were more than 70,000 disaster victims, more than 1,300 people were washed away in the city, more than 30,000 houses were washed away in the four townships, and more than 30,000 mu of farmland were submerged. The association tried its best to set up two porridge factories in Suizhong, which can only save four or five thousand people. It is hoped that charitable people in the country will urgently take action and rescue them from the abyss of suffering, so that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims will be spared from filling the ditches.</p>
<h3>National Government Reliefs Disaster Victims in Borneo</h3>
<p>Central Government and Guangdong Province Contributed 50,000 Yuan: The overseas Chinese residential area in Pontianak, the capital of the western region of Dutch Borneo, suffered a fire again, and the entire area was destroyed. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation General Association submitted a petition to the National Government, requesting relief. The Overseas Chinese General Association has now received a reply from the Ministry of Interior, stating that the Executive Yuan has decided to allocate 50,000 yuan for disaster relief. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Overseas Chinese Federation in Shanghai, in response to the previous telegram requesting relief for the Chinese residential area in Pontianak, the capital of the western region of Dutch Borneo, which was completely destroyed by fire, the ministry submitted the request to the Executive Yuan's meeting, which decided to approve the allocation of funds for relief and sent a telegram to the department for the record. The Executive Yuan's Order No. 3477 states that the Executive Yuan presented that a fire broke out in Pontianak, the capital of the western region of Dutch Borneo, and requested that funds be allocated to relieve the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese. It was found that the overseas Chinese in that port loved the motherland and supported the revolution with enthusiasm. Hearing of this great disaster, we deeply sympathize with them. The Executive Yuan should order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send a telegram to the resident consul to investigate the disaster and convey condolences. The Executive Yuan should also order the Ministry of Finance to send 50,000 yuan by telegram, the Guangdong Provincial Government to send 30,000 yuan by telegram, and the Fujian Provincial Government to send 20,000 yuan by telegram to provide practical relief to show the government's care for overseas Chinese.

<h3>County Government Proclamation Prohibiting Smoking and Rules for Rewarding Fines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a proclamation yesterday, stating, "In response to the order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Provincial Government issued an order approving the publication of the revised rules for rewarding fines for prohibiting smoking, and also attached the rules to the province government, asking the subordinates to comply. The rules are originally set up to encourage reporting smoking cases. All districts, townships, and towns should be widely notified, so that those who usually commit acts of planting, transporting, selling, and smoking will always feel the danger of their position and know to repent and reform themselves. In the future, it will be seen that smoking will be eliminated without prohibition, which will greatly benefit the future of smoking prohibition. The 54th meeting of the association discussed the above situation and resolved that the association should, in accordance with Article 22 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Smoking Prohibition, notify the provincial governments and municipal governments, and order their subordinates to copy and announce the Rules for Rewarding Fines for Prohibiting Smoking to the public. This is in addition to the consultation. The corresponding document is issued, hoping that you will investigate and order your subordinates to comply." In response to the request to issue and send the revised rules for rewarding fines for prohibiting smoking, we have previously ordered the department to comply. We now respond to the above and order the county magistrate to comply and announce it to the towns and villages in the city. This order is given in addition to the order to the county</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau complies, and a copy of the rules is attached to this order for the public to know. This proclamation (omitting the rules)</p>

The Municipal Council also gave Feetham complete freedom in his investigation and provided the necessary records and reports at any time. The scope of the investigation is very wide. All matters relating to the history of the concession, real estate issues, and current and future administrative issues are within its consideration.</p>

<h3>Huining Compatriot Association Receives SOS Telegram from Wan Citizens Traveling in Jingdezhen</h3>
<p>Expedite the dispatch of troops to rescue Huining compatriots traveling in Shanghai. The Association has received an urgent telegram from all Wan citizens traveling in Jingdezhen via Qimen, which is specially recorded below to show the tragic state of Jingdezhen. The original telegram reads: "To the Huining Compatriot Association, Jingdezhen is unfortunately suffering repeated devastation by communist bandits, with losses estimated in the millions.</p>
<p>People are displaced, and most homes are empty. When the National Army arrives, they quickly leave, leaving the area almost like a bandit's nest. The bandits come and go freely, and the suffering of the people is even deeper. Countless compatriots have been poisoned. They are hiding along the way, supporting the old and leading the young, suffering from hunger and cold, which is incredibly tragic. Qiwu is adjacent to Jingdezhen and is shocked and fearful. We implore you to forward telegrams to Chairman Chiang and He, the Commander-in-Chief for Bandit Suppression in Hunan and Jiangxi, ordering the bandit suppression troops to proceed with bandit suppression, eradicating the roots to protect the people's lives. Also, please send a telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government, urging them to quickly dispatch heavy troops to defend Qiwu. We eagerly await your order." After receiving the telegram, the Association has also sent telegrams to various parties to request assistance.</p>
<h3>Bandit Situation in Jinshan</h3>
<p>Jinshan has suffered from banditry for a long time. Although the army, navy, police, and other forces have repeatedly joined forces to suppress them, the bandits flee when the troops come and return when the troops leave. A thorough search and suppression have not been carried out, making it difficult to reduce the bandit atmosphere. Recently, a well-informed person from the county came to Shanghai and learned the general situation as follows: One group of bandits is still gathering at Liu Yan Bridge, southwest of Zhangyan, and another group is in Nanjiao, south of Luxiang. Recently, wealthy individuals in Luxiang, Langxia, and their vicinity have already relocated elsewhere. Even farming families with some farmland have received threatening letters, averaging about four or five per day. It is said that most of the letters received in Luxiang and other places are mailed from the Langxia Post Office, while most of the letters received in Langxia and other places are mailed from the Luxiang Post Office. Recently, a tea merchant from Luxiang sent a letter to a certain Jin in Langxia, entrusting him to forward it, but because a certain building could not forward it, it was returned to the original office. No one claimed it for a long time. Upon inspecting the contents, the meaning was as follows: ("My Yang sister's test board has a younger brother")</p>
<p>"Your brother has over seven hundred people and cannot develop. He is borrowing seven hundred yuan in foreign currency. He has set a deadline of the afternoon of the sixteenth for Boss Yang to personally negotiate at his house. If you do not come to negotiate, your house will be burned down," etc. It is said that Yang sister is the leader under Taibao A Shu. This kind of threatening letter can be ignored by the recipient, but in recent days, the families of Xu Jiaku Lu and Zheng Jiasheng Li in Luxiang received threatening letters one after another. Because they ignored them, the houses of the Lu and Li families were burned to the ground. According to another account, after receiving the letter, Li, fearing that he would follow in Lu's footsteps, privately raised funds and sent someone to deliver them. Who knew that there were several groups of bandits, and the person delivering the money, not knowing the inside story, mistakenly delivered it to another bandit leader. Therefore, Li lost his money and his house was burned down, and he regretted being born. The bandits in the countryside had no fear and dared to openly persuade the farmers in various ways, with the following meaning: ("This year's rice is very good, which shows that we are very lucky.") We, the bandits (self-proclaimed), should not return any rent rice, but send it to us to replenish our military rations, otherwise you must deal with it accordingly." As a result, the various households are greatly alarmed and deeply worried that the impact of collecting rent will plunge their lives into desperation next year. As for County Magistrate Lu Quan, he usually lives a secluded life and is currently on vacation. He has neither the appropriate skills to punish bandits, nor can he find a way to search and arrest them. His attitude is very passive. In addition to requesting a company of soldiers to protect Zhu Jing, the town where the county seat is located, he adopts a policy of not hearing or asking about the surrounding countryside. The actual strength of the rural police is usually very weak. In the event of a bandit attack, there is no resistance. The authorities have no way to reorganize and replenish them. For example, since the Luxiang Public Security Bureau was robbed of its weapons and the branch chief Guo Peng was shot and killed by bandits, there has been no successor to this day. All bureau affairs are temporarily handled by employees. During the day, there are still police officers stationed in the bureau, but at night, they all sleep outside the bureau and dare not sleep in the bureau. Police affairs are abandoned to such an extent that it is truly lamentable. In short, the entire Jinshan County has not yet reached a period of great panic on the surface, but in fact, when one delves into the content, there is a danger beyond imagination. Good people have no protection, and when they encounter bandit difficulties, they have nowhere to appeal. They appeal to the local police station, but they have no real strength. They appeal to the county government and the county public security bureau, but the bandits are numerous and they have no time to take care of them. Even if cases have been reported, there is still no solution. Therefore, the public can only endure the pain and hardship and deal with them. If they do not do what they want, people will be shot and houses will be burned. The officialdom dances and the bandits become more arrogant. Their chaos is like hemp, which is enough to make good people take risks. I deeply hope that officials at all levels will thoroughly solve the suffering of the Jinshan people who are in dire straits, and then the reporter will not be able to help but offer incense and prayers to save them.</p>
<h3>The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires Relocates to a New Address</h3>

<h3>Follow-up Report on the Collision of Ships</h3>
<p>The New Ningjie ship of the Pan Repair and Ning Shao Company set sail from the stream to its workplace, colliding with the British warship HMS Cornflower, causing damage to both bows. This matter has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the hole in the New Ningjie's starboard bow rudder Barmen was temporarily repaired with cement and wooden boards. After the company's chief shipowner inspected it, it was necessary to enter the dock for repairs. It has now been agreed that it will return to Shanghai next Tuesday and immediately stop working to enter the factory to repair the damaged area. The Old Ningjie ship will replace it starting next Wednesday. The damaged nose of the British warship HMS Cornflower also needs to enter the factory for repairs and was towed into the Jiangnan Shipyard the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Chu You Collision Case The Chang'an ship of the Sanbei Company collided with the naval warship Chu You in Nanjing last time. At that time, the Chu You ship was anchored on the river, while the Chang'an ship was transporting troops to Ning and collided while docking. The hull suffered minor damage. Chu You immediately sailed to Shanghai for repairs, and the Sanbei Company investigated the matter and agreed to compensate for the loss. The repair cost of the Chu You ship has now been truthfully issued by the Jiangnan Factory to the military department, and a letter has been sent to the Sanbei Company to collect this amount.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Money Syndicate Smashed</h3>
<p>Location: Dexiangli, Tangjiawan</p>
<p>Over 3,000 Yuan in Counterfeit Currency Confiscated At around 9 AM yesterday morning, the French police's special agency received a secret report stating that a certain Li, a northerner who lives at No. 4 Dexiangli, opposite the small vegetable market in Tangjiawan, specializes in using counterfeit Bank of China notes within the concession. They requested that he be apprehended immediately. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately ordered several Chinese and foreign detectives to go to the address. They intercepted Li at the alley entrance and then went to check inside No. 4. They found over 3,000 yuan in counterfeit notes in the pavilion room. They arrested two people, surnamed Zhou and Li's wife, and brought them to the police station for investigation. According to a Li, a Suzhou native and the landlord of the second room in the house, the No. 4 house was originally taken over by a Chen, a local native, and transferred to Li for 290 yuan on the twenty-ninth day of the old calendar last month. The arrested Li and Zhou rented from Chen. Li lived in the west front room downstairs and ran a gambling den, with a monthly rent of twelve yuan. It was due to expire on the twentieth of this month. Zhou lived in the pavilion room, with a rent of five and a half yuan. However, the two families were very close and each had a husband and wife, with no children. As for the use of counterfeit money, no one knew the details.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Big Abduction Case</h3>
<p>Under the Pretense of Performing in a Religious Ceremony</p>
<p>Most families lack discipline. Abductors Gu A'da, Jiang Guoren, Ji Lansheng, Zhou A'gen, Gu Hanlin, Zhou A'mao, Zhou Xiaoheshang, Wang Ruirong, Xu Zhoushi, etc. set up an organization specializing in abducting children and selling them to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and other places. They also took the abducted children Du Linfang, Li Zhanfang, Zhang A'bei, etc. on the Songshan Maru ship. At the Yangjiadu Wharf in Pudong, they were apprehended by the First District Detective of the Water Police Team. An organization was also smashed on Huanghe Road in the French Concession, and the abducted children Zhu Youquan and Wang Xiao'er were rescued. The abductors have been sent to the Local Court for investigation. However, the children are still left in the district department, so the court sent a letter requesting that the abducted be sent to the court for questioning. Yesterday, the children were sent to the court together by the district department. Prosecutor Yang opened a preliminary hearing. Hua A'di stated that he was thirteen years old, from Suzhou, and lived at No. 57 Renruili, Taiping Bridge. His father, Hua A'quan, was a mason. He came out on the twenty-sixth of last month. Zhou A'mao (only seventeen years old), one of the abductors, tricked me into going out, saying that I would perform in a religious ceremony and get four corners of foreign currency every day, saying that it was to make up the number, so I didn't need skills, etc. Li Zhanfang testified that he was fourteen years old, from Guangdong, and lived on Gordon Road. His father, Li Jinshi, had gone to Guangdong. My stepmother kicked me out. I met Zhou A'mao, who told me to act in a religious ceremony, etc. Wang Xiao'er stated that he was twelve years old, from Hangzhou, and lived on Tianbao Road in Hongkou. His father, Wang Weizhong, was a small businessman, and his mother was a stepmother. He was abused. I came out for a month. Zhou A'mao told me to perform in a religious ceremony, but I never did. Zhu Youquan stated that he was four years old, from Pudong. His parents were dead. I was brought out by a villager to find my brother, Zhu Zhangquan, who makes signs. I am from the Dragon King Temple. I was separated in front of the Great World and tricked by Zhou A'mao into performing in a religious ceremony. Du Linfang stated that he was thirteen years old, from Ningbo, and lived in Dongjiafang, Hongzhen. His parents were dead. He lived with his brother, Du Shengmu. His sister-in-law kicked me out. Gu A'da tricked me into performing in a religious ceremony. Since the confessions of the victims were clear, Mr. Yang ordered the children to be sent to the relief society for care, pending a guarantee from their families for collection. The abductors will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<h3>Two Sections of a Corpse</h3>
<p>Near Xiaoshadu on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<p>Blood and Flesh Muddled on the Tracks Again At 2:20 PM yesterday, patrol leader Shi Zhaoyu of the Tanzhawan police station in the Fourth District of Zhabei Headquarters, leading police on patrol, suddenly saw a section of the upper body of a human body next to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway behind the Xiaoshadu Lime Kiln. The bloodstains were dripping, and the situation was very frightening. He moved forward and found another section of the lower body, which together formed a complete human body. The blood and flesh were muddled, and it was unbearable to look at. At first, it was thought to be a murder victim, but then blood and flesh were found scattered on the tracks, and it was realized that it had been crushed to death by a train. The person was about thirty years old, with a monk's head, wearing a gray cotton jacket on the upper body, blue cloth trousers on the lower body, and bare feet without shoes, resembling a villager. He temporarily reported to the headquarters and ordered the local headman to report to the court for investigation. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Wu, accompanied by a clerk, drove to the scene for inspection. It was found that the unidentified male corpse had been crushed into two sections by a train before his death. Because there was no family to claim it, he ordered the local headman to prepare a coffin for burial first.</p>
<h3>Key Criminal in Fraudulent Thank You Case</h3>
<p>Six Fraud Cases Discovered</p>
<p>Two People Involved Xiangqi Master Xie Xuan (aka Xia Xun), a native of Pingyang, opened the Dacheng Bookstore at No. 222 North Sichuan Road. On August 18, he was defrauded of 750 yuan at room 65 of the Xinxin Hotel. Hua Detective Liang Chengyu of the Laozha Police Station arrested the perpetrators Wang Xianting, Huang Lushen, Shen Guozhong, and Li Song and handed them over to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. Liang Detective has now learned that Wang et al. also used gambling methods to defraud others of property in six cases: (1) In March of the seventeenth year, Huang Lushen, Lin Shaopei, and Wang Jichen defrauded Jiang Xiangyang of Wenzhou of 240 yuan in room 204 of the Shenzhou Hotel; (2) In March of the eighteenth year, Huang Lushen, Wang Xianting, and Lin Yimei defrauded Chen Debiao of Fuzhou of 12 yuan in foreign currency in room 402 of the Hong Kong Hotel; (3) In August of the eighteenth year, Wei Xuehua, Huang Lushen, Wang Jichen, and Wang Xianting defrauded Chen Zichun of Fuzhou of 1,515 yuan in foreign currency in room 12 of the Anle Palace; (4) In September of the eighteenth year, Huang Lushen, Liu Boyu, and Wang Xianting defrauded Hu Fengqing of Wenzhou of 200 yuan in foreign currency in room 512 of the Great China Hotel; (5) In October of the eighteenth year, Pan Guozhong, Wang Xianting, and Huang Lushen defrauded Yin Ziming of Fuzhou of 130 yuan in foreign currency in room 512 of the Great China; (6) In November of the eighteenth year, Huang Lushen, Lin Yimei, and Wang Jichen defrauded Lin Dachun of Fujian of 140 yuan in foreign currency in room 60 of the Xinxin Hotel, etc. Wang Xianting also confessed that Xu Jinsheng, a native of Changzhou who lives at No. 171 Beihai Road and used to work as a comprador at the Keville law firm, was the leader, and Wei Xiaohua, who currently lives at No. 37 Yuanfang Road, was also an accomplice. Liang detectives successively apprehended Xu and Wei and sent them to the Criminal Division of the Special Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Ru Bao'yi requested a postponement and a joint trial. Xu and Wei both firmly denied any fraud.</p>
<p>Judge Xu Jiashi verified the confessions and ordered the two defendants to be detained pending a rescheduled joint trial.</p>
<h3>Husband and Concubine End Their Lives</h3>
<p>Liu Binghui and Wang Yazhen Resolutely Died</p>
<p>Opened a Room at Fa Chang Inn and Two Lives Died On the evening of the sixteenth of last month, Guo Changqing, who claimed to be from Shaoxing, and his fiancée, Li, went to Room 16 of the Fa Chang Inn at No. 1 Weixiangli, Avenue Edward VII, to spend the night and committed suicide by taking poison at the same time. It was not until noon the next day that the porter noticed and reported it to the police. When the detectives were sent to investigate, Li was dead and Guo was barely breathing. A suicide note signed by Li Yiqing was found next to Guo, and a lottery ticket was found on Li's body. It was speculated that the suicide was due to gambling. Guo was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and Li's body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for an autopsy. By 8 PM that evening, Guo also died of deep-seated opium poisoning, and the hospital notified the police to take the body to the morgue and report it to the authorities for an autopsy. Because no family was found, it was ordered that the two bodies be photographed and that the hall provide coffins for burial, pending family claiming the bodies, as reported in the newspaper. It is now known that the real name of the deceased man was Liu Binghui, 28 years old, from Shaoxing, and the woman's name was Wang Yazhen, 24 years old, from Hangzhou. She was Liu's concubine, not his fiancée. It was not because of gambling that they lost their lives, but there was another reason for the suicide. Liu used to work in politics and policing and then switched to business. He had parents and brothers at his original home and had married and had children. Five years ago, he took Yazhen as his concubine in Hangzhou and came to Shanghai together to do business. In April of this year, he entered the Yu Sheng Silk Weaving Factory as the factory director. He had a disagreement with a certain night shift foreman and received an anonymous letter saying that he wanted to kill Liu. Liu was therefore discouraged and left the factory on August 28, giving rise to the idea of suicide. His concubine, Wang Yazhen, found out and was willing to live and die together, following him to the underworld. Therefore, the husband and concubine decided to commit suicide together. He also sent a letter to his family, describing the suicide and instructing them to add two pairs of cups and chopsticks when offering sacrifices during the holidays. After the letter was sent, they bought four bottles of tranquilizer and went to the Xiaozhongyang Hotel on the Four Horses Road under the name of Li Yiqing on the evening of the twenty-ninth and opened a room to spend the night, each drinking two bottles of tranquilizer and lying down to wait for death. However, because the medicine was mild, they woke up together the next morning. The two were unhappy that their purpose had not been achieved and left the inn to plan another way to die. At this time, the family received the letter and was shocked. His sister and younger brother came to Shanghai to find him, and after meeting, they persuaded him to go home. However, Liu and others were determined to die and agreed to go home. After the sister and brother went home, they bought raw opium and went to Fa Chang Inn on the evening of September 16, under the names of Guo Changqing and Guo Li, and opened a room, swallowing a large amount of raw opium to commit suicide, and finally could not be saved. They went to Quantai together. Later, after relatives and friends saw the report, they searched for five or six days without seeing them. They went to the French Police Station and Tongren Fuyuan Hall to inquire and recognized the photos as Liu and Wang. They immediately sent a letter to the Shaoxing family. His father, Liu Zixuan (67 years old, working in the Lanxi Stamp Tax Bureau),</p>
<p>Accompanied by a relative surnamed Guo, came to Shanghai a few days ago to contact the Fuyuan Hall for coffin handling procedures. On the one hand, they purchased two coffins from the Shaoxing Guild Hall and sent them to the hall yesterday. The hall sent laborers to the Pudong cemetery to hoist the two coffins back, change coffins, and deposit them at the Shaoxing Guild Hall, waiting to be transported back for burial during the Winter Solstice Festival.</p>
<h3>Husband Catches Adultery</h3>

<p>Ni Xiang Sheng Clambers Under the Bed Ying Ruqing, a native of Shaoxing who lives at No. 4 Tiantongli, Diswei Road, Zhabei, is a dyer. He married a Mei, who is very beautiful. They have been married for many years and have always been harmonious. However, Mei has recently changed her old ways and has an affair with Ni Xiang Sheng, becoming very intimate, while becoming disgusted with her husband. When her husband goes out, she often invites Ni to her house for a tryst. This has happened more than once. The day before yesterday, she invited Ni to continue the joy. However, Ying suddenly returned home to get something and saw that the door was tightly closed. He was very surprised. He listened carefully and vaguely heard a man's voice inside. He was even more surprised and peered into the gap, and saw a man and his wife hugging and kissing in an ugly manner. He could not help but be burned by jealousy and broke into the room. Ni immediately scrambled under the bed, and Ying grabbed his feet and dragged him out, beating him severely. He also twisted his wife to prevent her from putting on clothes and shouted to catch the adulterer. The sound reached outside, and the police from the Fifth District Third Post came when they heard the news. For a time, the onlookers were like a wall, all clapping their hands in approval. The police ordered the man and woman to put on their clothes and took the adulterous husband and adulterous wife to the police station. After the director interrogated them separately, the case was related to adultery, which hindered customs and morals, and was ordered to be handled by the Judicial Division.</p>

<h3>Paramour Acts as Matchmaker, Mother and Son Die</h3>
<p>Shen Hairong, a farmer in Hongqiao Town, Shanghai West, has a daughter named Xiaomei, who is now over twenty years old. She has been having an affair with Xu Huogen, who runs a tailor shop. Later, because she became secretly pregnant, her belly gradually grew larger. In March of this year, with Xiaomei's slight agreement, Huogen acted as a matchmaker and betrothed her to Xu A'jian, a carpenter from Xiaoxujiatang in the south of the town, to be his wife, and chose a date in the winter to get married. But Shang Qiang secretly did not know it all along. By June, there were inevitably rumors flying around, which reached A'jian's ears. Only then did he know that his fiancée, Xiaomei, was actually Huogen's lover. But his face was at stake, and he endured it without saying anything. He then led her to Shanghai in early June to live. When she was about to give birth the day before yesterday, the child was already dead in her womb. The doctor used manual surgery to deliver the dead child, but Xiaomei's condition worsened after childbirth and she died yesterday morning. Before dying, she said to A'jian, "I (Xiaomei referring to herself) was actually killed by Huogen, and I cannot rest in peace. Please avenge me and ask him to return all the losses and expenses." A'jian, seeing this situation, suffered this strange humiliation and lost both his person and his money. He was very sad and reported it to the Sixth District First Branch Police Station, requesting that the matchmaker (that is, Xiaomei's paramour) Xu Huogen be arrested for investigation. He also reported to the Local Court for inspection and filed a criminal prosecution, with a private prosecution attached.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Suffers from Nervous Disorder</h3>
<p>A woman named Wang Axiu, a native of Henglin, Changzhou, is currently twenty-two years old. Her father is deceased, and Axiu lives at home, often arguing with her elder brother and sister-in-law, leading to frequent quarrels within the family. Axiu, affected by this stimulation, underwent a sudden change in her normal state. At the beginning of the seventh lunar month this autumn, she suddenly developed a nervous disorder, talking to herself, with unpredictable mood swings. Her mother, Zhou, was very displeased by this condition. Consequently, on the fifth of this month, she brought her daughter to Shanghai, residing in the home of her eldest daughter, Shi Wang, at No. 17 Hua'an Fang, North Zhejiang Road. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 3:00 PM, Axiu went out alone for a leisurely stroll. As it grew late, she lost her way and, around 7:00 PM, mistakenly wandered to the side of the Black Water River near the Jinji Bridge in the eastern part of Xujiahui Town, where she lingered and gazed, intending to drown herself in the river. She was spotted by Shi Hegen, the patrol officer from the local police station. Suspecting that the woman's attempt to drown herself at night might involve other circumstances, he stepped forward to stop her and rescued her. She was taken back to the station and then transferred to the second division of the sixth district in Xujiahui. After a brief interrogation by the station chief, the woman's words were incoherent, her answers unrelated to the questions. She did not know her detailed address and threw the objects on the table at will. After a long while, they found out that her brother-in-law was named Shi Yating, a salesman of foreign goods, living behind the Hu'an Fang at the train station. The police chief, Liu, dispatched a policeman to order her sister to come to the station to take her back under supervision, to prevent any accidents.</p>
<h3>Russian Youth Reports Suicide to Police Station</h3>
<p>Doctors Say He Has Little Hope of Survival. According to Dalu Bao, yesterday morning (the 11th), a young Russian man in the French Concession, claiming to be named Shijialai Qian, walked into the Baokang Road Police Station and reported that he wanted to commit suicide. The police were astonished and examined his right wrist, finding that he had indeed used a sharp blade to sever his artery, with blood gushing out. Just as they were about to question him in detail, the man suddenly fainted and fell to the ground. Two policemen lifted him up, used towels to tie the wound, and rushed him to Guangci Hospital. After examination by the doctors, they were informed that he had lost too much blood and had little hope of survival. According to others' speculation, this young Russian may have been heavily in debt and was being pressured by creditors. Currently, the French police are investigating.</p>
<h3>Car Towing Car Kills Construction Worker</h3>
<p>A few days ago, in the afternoon, Ding Xiaolou was driving a mud-laden car with license plate number 16823 and drove into an alley on Route Robert, first unloading the mud on the ground. However, the wheels became stuck in the mud, making it impossible to move. Ding Xiaolou had to call for help loudly. At that moment, a cargo car with license plate number 16687 happened to pass by and stopped upon hearing the call. The two cars were tied together with ropes, back to back, and then the second car towed the first. After the 16687 car started moving, the first car, stuck in the mud, began to drive in reverse. After about ten paces, the mud car had been freed from the predicament. The driver of the second car, Wang Maotang, stopped the car, intending to untie the rope and leave. He also instructed Ding Xiaolou to stop the car. However, Ding did not hear and continued to reverse, crushing a small worker, Chuan Yuancheng, who was untying the rope. Ding quickly stopped the car. Workers in the car sent Chuan to the hospital. He died upon arrival. His body was sent to the Phelon Road autopsy center. The day before yesterday, the Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo to the center to examine the body. He ordered the body to be temporarily received by Qian Zhonghai, awaiting the arrival of the deceased's parents from their hometown in Shanghai, to have the coffin prepared and buried. He also instructed the two drivers, Ding Xiaolou and Wang Maotang, to each pay 40 yuan to the deceased's family.</p>

Alas, Heaven and Earth are ruthless, treating all things as straw dogs. The weather changes unpredictably, bringing misfortune. Weapons of war, once used defensively, are now filled with gunpowder and fire. Seeking excellence, we strive to increase production to meet military needs, hoping to defeat the enemy and fearing no harm. But who could have foreseen this tragic accident? The third of June was an inauspicious day. There was Jinan before, and now Gaochang. With a deafening roar, all was turned to ashes. The charred remains are a horrific sight. Sacrificing themselves for the country, they are like those on the battlefield. Twenty-three of them have departed one after another. Their deaths will not be in vain, and their memory will endure. We offer these fruits to comfort their souls. May they enjoy this offering. Amen." The union's memorial address stated: "We respectfully honor the workers of the Gaochangmiao shell factory who died on June 3, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. We specially commemorate this day of tragic suffering. Alas, comrades, serving in the arsenal, manufacturing shells, daring not to be negligent, striving for excellence, planning in detail, with one heart and one mind, supporting the front lines, sweeping away the remnants of the enemy, killing and destroying, relying on our skills for peaceful unification. Unexpectedly, due to negligence, this grand aspiration was not realized. With a deafening roar, they were engulfed. Alas, my comrades, the disaster is unforgettable. Alas, how sad! The catastrophe of June 3rd fills us with sorrow. The news is heartbreaking, and the sight is agonizing. Some left behind elderly parents, some abandoned wives, some left no descendants, and some caused illness. We will provide preferential treatment and relief to the bereaved, urgently seek proper aftercare, and provide generous assistance. Pain begets reflection, the explosion resonates. They died instantly, never tasting the medicine. Alas, how sad! The bond of comradeship is paramount. May their souls in the afterlife receive this offering. Amen." The shell factory's memorial address stated: "On this, the twelfth day of October, the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, colleagues from the Shanghai Arsenal shell factory, with sincere wine and seasonal delicacies, pay tribute to the spirits of the workers who died on June 3rd. Alas, all living beings are created by Heaven. Who brings about clarity and confusion? How can we seek life? How can we avoid death? Is it that human emotions are so different from the heavens? Or is the universe chaotic and all things subject to chance? The dead are without knowledge, and we mourn for you. If they have knowledge, may they know themselves. How bright their spirits, how radiant their light! We seem to hear their voices and see their faces. Alas, they are far away. When will we forget them? May they enjoy this offering. Amen."</p>

<h3>Reasons for Delay of Shanghai-Hangzhou Night Freight Train</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's 26th freight train, which departed from Shanghai for Hangzhou at 8:15 PM the night before last, experienced a sudden engine failure and slight damage to the freight cars at kilometer 89 between Jiashan and Jiaxing. The train stopped there awaiting assistance. The train conductor walked to Jiaxing to report to the stationmaster, who telegraphed both the Transportation and Mechanical Affairs Departments, requesting them to dispatch a rescue train. As a result, the 1st early express train from Zhapu to Shanghai, which arrived at Jiaxing at 6:45 AM yesterday (the 12th), was unable to pass due to the blocked track. The 1st train was temporarily held at Jiaxing Station for over three hours before the rescue train was dispatched from Zhapu to the scene of the accident. The 26th freight train was connected and towed to Hangzhou, and traffic was restored. Therefore, the 1st train from Hangzhou arrived at Shanghai South Station at 3:30 PM, a delay of over three hours. The 3rd and 5th trains from Hangzhou were also delayed by three to four hours.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Merchant Attempts to Evade Customs Duty</h3>
<p>Post Office Discovers Thirty Diamonds in Registered Mail.</p>
<p>Estimated Value of Nearly 100,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Authorities Requested to Investigate Source. According to the Shanghai Times, postal authorities in this city recently discovered that someone was privately mailing diamonds into Shanghai from abroad via registered mail, in an attempt to evade customs duties. A total of thirty diamonds of various sizes were discovered, with an estimated value of nearly 100,000 yuan. The relevant foreign companies have been notified to explain why taxable goods were privately mailed via registered mail. It is also reported that the post office has established inspection procedures, and all registered mail will be subject to strict inspection in the future. However, postal authorities are unwilling to disclose the details. The discovery came about because, in the past three or four months, postal officials suspected that someone was smuggling diamonds into the country via registered mail, so they secretly paid attention. In the early part of last week, a registered letter, sent from abroad to a certain jewelry company in this city, aroused the suspicion of the customs officials stationed at the post office. They reported this to their superiors, and upon opening the letter, they found two large, exquisitely cut diamonds. They were immediately instructed to keep the matter secret and increase inspections. As a result, numerous registered mail items containing diamonds were successively discovered within a week, all sent from Hong Kong. However, it is believed that the diamonds were smuggled from Europe to Hong Kong and then forwarded to Shanghai, with Hong Kong being used as an intermediary to avoid suspicion, since it would be easier to detect if they were sent directly from Europe to Shanghai jewelry companies. It is reported that postal authorities have requested the Hong Kong Post Office to assist in investigating the source and have confiscated the discovered diamonds.</p>
<h3>Please Arrest the Degenerate Who Abused a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Shen Meixian, a girl from Changzhou residing in Zhabei, is only thirteen years old. A few days ago, her mother went to the market to buy vegetables, leaving Meixian alone at home. Suddenly, a flirtatious neighbor named Er arrived and, with sweet words, lured her to a hotel in the concession. There, he confined her to a room, threatened her at will, and raped her for three to five days before disappearing. Meixian, feeling humiliated, feared being scolded by her mother and spent her days in tears. The hotel learned of the situation and immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, who dispatched Western police officer No. 315 to the scene. She was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, and the doctors were requested to provide a medical report. The police were also asked to arrest the degenerate and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Don't Pretend to Have a Pass on the Tram</h3>
<p>What a Foolish A'dou. Chuan A'dou, a native of Ningbo, pretended to have a pass when taking a tram in the French Concession the day before yesterday. He was discovered by the ticket inspector and sent to the police station. Yesterday, he was taken to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff, the tram company, had an employee testify about the incident. When questioned, Chuan confessed that a friend had taught him that if he wanted to save tram fare, he should say he had a pass. He was fooled by his friend and unaware of violating the regulations. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Chuan to a fine of two yuan, or two days of detention, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Announces Standardized Titles for Store Staff</h3>
<p>General Manager...Manager...Deputy Manager. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice stating that it had previously noted that the titles of important staff members in companies and shops in the city varied, including zongli (director), xieli (assistant director), jingli (manager), fuli (deputy manager), zheng sili (chief executive), and fu sili (deputy executive), and that these were selected arbitrarily without any fixed standard. This made it difficult for outsiders to understand who held representative authority. It was therefore proposed to standardize the titles to improve understanding. It was decided that all those previously referred to as zongli, zheng sili, or other similar titles should be uniformly renamed as jingli (manager). Those previously referred to as xieli, fuli, fu sili, or other similar titles should be uniformly renamed as fu jingli (deputy manager). The manager of the head office or main store should be renamed as zong jingli (general manager). This was submitted to the third meeting of the Executive Committee and approved. A request was then submitted to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau for approval. Approval was granted in Document No. 2281, stating that the proposed standardization of titles for important staff members in companies and stores was appropriate and should be implemented. The Shanghai Municipal Government would be informed and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would be notified for record-keeping. You are hereby notified and requested to instruct all affiliated companies and stores to comply with the requirements. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Rise and Fall of Pacific Shipping Lines</h3>
<p>The decline of Sino-American shipping has reached its peak today. Freight rates have plummeted, the number of ships has increased, and the volume of cargo has decreased, causing shipping companies to reduce their business due to poor performance. The recent situation is described below:</p>
<p>Nippon Yusen Sells Ships. This year, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) added nine new ships to compete in Sino-American shipping. Now that all have been completed and put into service, business is poor. Exports from San Francisco and New York are extremely scarce. Massive ships of ten thousand tons each carry only one or two hundred tons of cargo each time. As a result, older ships such as the Tenyo Maru and Kako Maru have been successively taken out of service, eighteen in total. Sailors have been dismissed and sent back to China. It has now been decided to sell the eighteen ships that have been taken out of service as a way to reduce expenses and tighten operations.</p>
<p>Osaka Changes Routes. The Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Line) has built six new massive ships for the New York route, which are being put into service one after another. However, with Sino-American shipping experiencing a surplus of ships and a shortage of cargo, the company plans to change the routes of the six new ships to adjust operations and reduce costs. It will stop calling at Shanghai and transship Chinese exports in Japan. This will reduce the cost of tonnage fees, harbor dues, and other expenses by several thousand yuan per ship. With little cargo in Shanghai, the freight income is insufficient to cover import expenses. This matter is currently under discussion. Kawasaki Shipping Line. After the Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line) withdrew from the Pacific Freight Conference, it has expanded its Sino-American routes to two lines. Originally only serving San Francisco, it has now added a route from Shanghai to Seattle, starting this month, deploying two ships each month. Since its export freight rates are not bound by the conference, they can be freely determined, leading to fierce competition recently.</p>
<p>Tianxiang Passenger Tickets. The five massive Tianxiang Pacific ships can reach New York in thirty-seven days. The ships have reduced personnel, with only thirty-seven people per ship, including the captain. With reduced expenses, business is good. Recently, the five ships began selling passenger tickets. Tickets from Shanghai to New York are only 370 US dollars, which is 40% cheaper than other companies' ships. As a result, there is a rush to buy tickets. It is said that tickets for the ships in February next year have already been booked.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Zhujiajia-Shanghai Road Culvert Project</h3>
<p>The Construction Bureau of Qingpu County, for the convenience of farmers, built the culverts and other projects on the section of the county road from Zhujiajiao in Qingpu County to Shanghai, to benefit agriculture. The construction has been completed and a report was submitted to the Jiangsu Construction Department. Director Sun commissioned Wu Wenhua, Director of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, to inspect and accept the project impartially. Director Wu traveled to Qingpu the day before yesterday morning to inspect and accept the project together with Zhang Qiwu, Director of the Qingpu County Construction Bureau, in compliance with the order.</p>
<h3>Peddlers from Zhejiang Go to Guangdong to Apply for Passports to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Municipality Also Strictly Enforces Restrictions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a message from the Guangzhou Municipal Government stating that about two hundred peddlers and merchants from Wenzhou and Chu counties in Zhejiang Province have successively applied to the issuing authorities in Guangzhou for passports to go abroad to do business in France, Belgium, Portugal, and other countries. The Guangzhou authorities questioned why these merchants, when passing through Shanghai, did not apply for passports there, but instead came all the way to Guangzhou to apply. The Guangzhou Municipality asked the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate and report the reasons. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved the request and has asked the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate and reply. It is rumored that the reason why these peddlers and merchants from Zhejiang are going to Guangzhou to apply for passports is that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly received telegrams from ambassadors abroad stating that there are too many beggars and peddlers abroad, which damages the image of the country, and requesting that serious restrictions be imposed. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strictly ordered the passport issuing authorities to be cautious in issuing passports. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's handling of passports for going abroad is stricter than in other places. As a result, these peddlers and merchants, in order to find a way out, are flocking to Guangzhou to apply for passports. It is now reported that the Guangzhou Municipal Government has also begun to strictly enforce restrictions.</p>
<h3>Woolen Industry Invents Wool Floss</h3>
<p>Major figures in China's chemical and woolen industries, after spending years of painstaking research and intellectual effort, have invented wool floss made from pure wool sheared from Merino sheep, which is sterilized and refined, and then loosened using the latest type of elastic machine. The material is light, soft, clean, warm, and its ability to maintain temperature and harmonize with the skin is far superior to silk, cotton, and other types of wool. The price is extremely low. Making a long robe only requires one pound of this wool floss, costing only four yuan. It can be said to meet the three requirements of economy, warmth, and hygiene. Since the price is so low, those traveling at night need not worry about being targeted by thieves. Furthermore, weaving a blanket only requires two and a half pounds of wool floss.

<h3>Zhejiang Peddlers Go to Guangdong to Apply for Passports to Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Guangzhou City Also Strictly Enforces Restrictions</p>
<p>Recently the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received information from the Guangdong City Government. Briefly stated, about two hundred street peddlers and merchants from Wen and Chu county of Zhejiang Province that have come from Shanghai to Guangdong and have asked passport issuing bureaus of our city to issue passports for going overseas to do business in countries such as France, Belgium and Portugal. After investigation this class of merchants, why would they after going through Shanghai not nearby request a passport, but instead they turn around and go to Guangzhou to request one. What is the reason. A consult is requested to be made with the Shanghai City Government to inquire and to recover a concrete answer. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved the consult and has in turn consulted with the Shanghai City Government for a concrete answer. Slightly heard this class of merchants of Zhejiang to go to Guangdong to request passport without labour. The reason is from embassies stationed in other countries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continuously sending telegrams that currently abroad there are a lot of beggars, and street peddlers which harms the nation’s reputation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requests there should be severe restrictions placed on the passport issuing bureaus and for there to be caution for those who issue. That is why it seems the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau procedures for dealing with the application of passports to go abroad seems to be stricter compared to other ports. Therefore, this class of street peddlers and merchants for the sake of the way out has gone to Guangdong to request passports. Now it is heard that the Guangdong City Government is also from now on strictly enforcing restrictions.</p>

<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Letter from the Western Pigment Industry Trade Association to the Tax Bureau:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs,</p>
<p>We are writing to you based on a statement from our member, Shangda Pigment Store, who reported that on the 9th of this month, they were transporting seventy-five cans of assorted pigment samples to the Tongfeng Dye Factory on Baoshan Road. While passing the Shanghai Yang Indigo Tax Assessment Office in Zhabei, they were accused of tax evasion, and the aforementioned pigment goods, along with the delivery vehicle and waybill, were all detained with the intention of imposing a fine. They have requested that we protest and reclaim the goods based on reason. Upon investigation, these pigments are indeed assorted samples, and the cans are not in whole units. According to established practice, they are not declared to avoid trivialities. Furthermore, the principle of taxation does not mandate taxing individual samples. Therefore, we are writing to inform you of the situation, hoping that your office will investigate and instruct the Tax Assessment Office to return the seventy-five cans of pigment samples, along with the waybill and delivery vehicle, to Shangda Pigment Store to uphold tax policy and facilitate commerce. We also request a written response.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Thanking Those Who Support the National Products Movement (Continued) Pan Gongzhan</h3>
<p>Further examining the average capital of each factory, Japanese factories average about 2.6 million yuan, British factories about 2.3 million yuan, French factories about 900,000 yuan, and American factories about 400,000 yuan, while Chinese factories average only about 70,000 yuan, more than thirty times smaller than Japanese factories, thirty times smaller than British factories, fourteen times smaller than French factories, and five or six times smaller than American factories. With such meager capital, how can domestic factories compete against the economic aggression of international imperialism and hope they will charge forward and open up paths for national products? Third, let's examine how labor is distributed and used in Shanghai's industry. According to the Social Affairs Bureau's survey in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), about 240,000 people work in over 1,500 factories, not including those who work outside the factories. The distribution is as follows: (1) textile industry, about 170,000 people; (2) food industry, about 21,000 people; (3) chemical industry, about 15,000 people; (4) machinery industry, about 13,000 people; (5) printing industry, about 9,000 people; (6) daily necessities industry, about 2,500 people; (7) appliance industry, about 2,500 people; (8) other industries, about 5,000 people in total. Do domestic factories or foreign factories employ more of these workers? Based on the proportion of capital, it seems that foreign-funded factories should employ more workers. However, this is not the case because foreign factories have concentrated capital, mass production, and effective management, which naturally reduces labor costs. For example, in the textile industry's cotton mills, the number of spindles managed by one Chinese worker in a Japanese cotton mill is one-third to one-half more than in a Chinese cotton mill. Therefore, the Chinese-owned cotton mills and fabric factories in the city have only 770,000 spindles, 43,000 thread spindles, and 7,400 looms, which are less than the 1.16 million spindles, 117,000 thread spindles, and 10,000 looms of foreign-funded factories, but the total number of workers employed actually exceeds that of foreign-funded factories. From this, it can be inferred that the labor used by the 1,400 domestic factories must exceed the labor used by the 2-300 foreign-funded factories. This indirectly reveals that the cost of domestic factory products, the so-called national products, is certainly higher than that of foreign factory products, regardless of labor-management disputes. How can they compete? Fourth, the reasons for the decline of the national product industry can also be understood from labor-management disputes and work stoppages. According to the Social Affairs Bureau's statistics on strike and work stoppage cases, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Nationality of the Capitalist 17th Year 18th Year Total Percentage Total Percentage</p>
<p>Chinese 96 80.00 80 72.07</p>
<p>Japanese 7 5.83 15 15.71</p>
<p>British 11 9.17 11 9.90</p>
<p>American 2 1.67 2 1.80</p>
<p>German 2 1.67</p>
<p>French 1 0.83 4 3.60</p>
<p>Russian 1 0.83</p>
<p>Italian 1 0.90</p>
<p>Total 120 100.00 111 100.00</p>
<p>From the table above, we know that there were a total of 120 strike and work stoppage cases in the 17th year and 111 cases in the 18th year. The situation seems to be improving. Furthermore, in the 17th year, the number of factories affected by strike and work stoppage cases was 5,438, and the number of employees affected was 213,966. In the 18th year, the number of factories affected was only 1,512, and the number of employees affected was also reduced to 68,861. In particular, it is felt that the trend of labor unrest has eased in the 18th year. However, in any case, Chinese factories are affected by strikes or work stoppages, accounting for 72% to 80% of the total number of factories. Domestic factories, with their fragile foundation and weak financial resources, are naturally forced to close down due to the continuous strikes. Those that are fortunate enough to survive are merely eking out a living. Let's further analyze the reasons and results of strike and work stoppage cases in the past two years. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Visiting the Women's Dormitory on Double Tenth Day</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>The women's dormitory is originally a solemn and sacred place, with an invisible sense of "no entry for outsiders." Although one can sometimes enter the hall, entering the rooms is not allowed.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Double Tenth Day of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), which was especially worth celebrating. Therefore, the Jinan University Women's Student Association passed a resolution stating that the women's dormitory would be open for public viewing for two days starting from National Day, hoping that all teachers and students of the school would visit to improve the students' cleanliness, autonomy, and other qualities…</p>
<p>As soon as the news of the visit was released, it immediately caused a great stir. Some people were even more impatient than usual.</p>
<p>Finally, on the morning of the jubilant National Day (9:00 AM), it was opened.</p>
<p>There were five or six of us male students who went. Before entering the "Eastern Palace," we saw many people winding around in front of and behind the palace. Upon arriving at the majestic and solemn "Eastern Palace," in addition to the usual festive decorations of lanterns and colored streamers, there was also a set of rules for the visit, which were roughly divided into six items, mostly regarding time and matters requiring attention. However, one rule stated that one must not flip through drawers or books, probably to prevent a repeat of the old story from a certain year at "Ai Fu" University, where the drawers of the Miss 84 were found to contain many Liangxiang chestnut shells, preserved tangerine peel wrappers, and peanut peel by the visitors. Because of this past lesson, it was prohibited.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the "Eastern Palace," Director He and several other "palace owners" stood to receive visitors. Mr. He, in particular, had a smiling face and expressed a warm welcome, nodding and greeting each of us.</p>
<p>After entering the palace, the first room we browsed was Mr. He's bedroom, which had two beds, one large and one small. On each bed, there were lively and adorable foreign dolls. On the four walls, there were art photos and other items hanging everywhere. The decoration was elegant and could be considered a model for the entire palace.</p>
<p>Then, we went from bottom to top, visiting the rooms one by one. The decoration and arrangement of each room had its own merits. Some had the desks arranged in a rectangular, horizontal, or diamond shape, with all sorts of shapes. It could be said that they had put a lot of effort into it. The tablecloths used on the desks were white, colored paper, or green velvet. The bookshelves were arranged with Chinese and Western books in order of height, even neater than the library.</p>
<p>In a certain room, all four walls were covered with Berlin floral paper. The desks of each person were very beautiful, and there were also beautiful table lamps added, which added a lot of color. The beddings in each bed were folded like those in display windows, and all the palace owners in the rooms were absent. Some people said that this was a (model room).</p>
<p>When we stepped into the renowned Miss Yang Zeheng's room, the first thing we saw was a photo of her fiancé hanging high on the wall. He looked energetic and was truly a promising young man and a lovable partner. I deeply congratulate Miss Yang on her future.</p>
<p>The busiest person that day had to be Miss Luo, a key figure in the Women's Student Association. Miss Luo was highly respected and full of experience, and she knew many students, especially. This was Miss Luo, and that was Miss Luo. She was truly busy beyond belief, handing out candies and serving tea. The students coming from behind were so crowded that they even trampled on the floor.</p>
<p>I heard that the refreshments in Room 19 were the most exquisite, with a lot of Florida oranges and fresh fruits. Unfortunately, the reporter was not familiar with them and did not have the opportunity to taste them, which I deeply regret.</p>
<p>In short, the women students are much better than us in their appreciation of beauty, especially in their spirit of cooperation, which we admire. Please ask yourselves if the male students have such a thing… This is not supporting them, but it is the truth, and there is no denying it.</p>
<p>Finally, we came down and there was a criticism area at the door, asking us to give our opinions. Others had already written words such as (artistic), scientific, clean, beautiful, refreshing… and so on, which all amounted to truth, goodness, and beauty. Our criticisms, of course, could not escape this range. However, the criticism book was made of foreign paper, and writing with a brush made it difficult to dry. If it wasn't done well, it would become a mess, which was a bit of a flaw.</p>
<h3>Minor Conflict</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Correspondence</p>
<p>Ding,</p>
<p>Have you forgotten me? This question may seem a bit harsh, but think about it, it's been almost twelve days, and I haven't received a letter from you. You know how anxious I am, so why haven't you written? I can't understand it at all. The question weighs on my mind, making it impossible for me to prepare my lessons. And then I discovered something even more absurd about you.</p>
<p>Are you trying to earn a few stinking dollars from稿費(manuscript fees/royalties)? Hmph, you actually published the letter you wrote to me in the newspaper! Have you forgotten my address? Did you have to publish the letter in the newspaper for me to see it? But Bao Ding, I know that you, being so clever, wouldn't be so foolish. Think about it, newspapers are for the public. If a letter is published in the newspaper, and the newspaper prints only one copy, just for me to see, that would be understandable. Of course, the smell of ink and lead type can't compare to your beautiful, handwritten script. But now, everyone has seen it! Everyone is your "Jia"! Do you feel bad when you read this? Do you want to cry? This is something people will criticize. I was twelve-thousand percent unwilling to say it, but when I was forced to curse you, Ding, I spoke out. Please know that I'm very angry.</p>
<p>I'm furious, but then I reconsidered. You wouldn't do something like this. Aren't you the one who always secretly slips my letters into the mailbox? Okay, I thought of something else. Perhaps Mei stole it and mischievously submitted it. But Mei is too awful. Her joke shouldn't be like this. At most, she should extort some money, but why play with us like this? I was originally going to give her a Parker fountain pen for her twentieth birthday, but now I shouldn't. Ding, what do you think? If I don't give it to her, she might do something even worse in the future, which would be even worse. Do you think I should still give it to her? And maybe give her a little extra, so she won't do this again in the future? Okay?</p>
<p>When I saw the newspaper, I wanted to immediately go to the newspaper office to inquire. I went to the newspaper office gate, full of anger, and paced back and forth in front of the gate six or seven times. I didn't have the courage to go in. It's not that I don't have courage, but I realize that I'm afraid the editor-in-chief won't be there, or that the editor-in-chief will put on a stern face and say, "The newspaper is responsible for what is published. Please, don't ask." If I encountered such a situation, I would be even more angry. So, I went back to school. My classmates were all talking about me, saying things like, "A love letter made public!" and "Miss Ding is so generous!" I couldn't bear to hear such things, so I walked away, wandering around aimlessly. Then I bought another newspaper and looked at it again, and I found another article that you copied for me to read, "Father and Son." Oh, how strange. There's no such thing in the world.</p>
<p>I read this article over and over again, and I think "Yu Wuhen" is too good at wronging people. People are made of flesh and blood, and they have compassion. Although some may have less, is it possible that the head of a middle school has no compassion? Ding, are you perhaps agreeing with the author's fabrications and want me to critique it? I'll tell you, the head of a school has an educational responsibility to the students. Parents want their children to become talented, not to be exploited. Ding, if you were in a similar situation, would you be willing to be separated from your family by the headmaster? Separation of flesh and blood is the most cruel thing in the world, and no one with a conscience would resort to such a poisonous tactic. Ding, I don't believe this is true. I'm sure "Yu Wuhen" is building a "castle in the air." Furthermore, the student is extremely capable. He studies and can also be the chairman of a major meeting. Such a person is a future great man. Let the party use him? Hmph, no way.</p>
<p>But then I reconsidered, thinking about "Tian Wuhen" and the school authorities. "Yu Wuhen" is bold enough to publish such an article. Does he really have such great power to make wild accusations? Universities are places of integrity and should not tolerate such fabricators. The school authorities should investigate this matter. Didn't you say that a Director Chen is already angry? Does he think it's related to him? If what you said is true, then I think this director is absolutely right, because everyone should avoid suspicion. It's like me. The other day, people at school said that I was in love with Ms. Wang. I don't know Ms. Wang at all. They spread rumors, so I went to the Dean of Students' office to ask for an investigation of the rumor-mongers. I thought the Dean of Students would definitely agree, but instead, he lectured me, saying that I was "feeling guilty like a thief." As long as you are innocent, why believe rumors? This old-fashioned Dean of Students thinks that my conduct has always been upright, so he told me to behave myself in the future. If it were someone with bad conduct, he would have been investigating my behavior. Ding, I'm so angry. I wanted to tell you about this anger when we met on Sunday, but after reading the newspaper, it added another layer of anger, so my enthusiasm to see you disappeared. Of course, at that time, I hated you.</p>

<p>This double (something missing) really made me so mad (something missing) Xixiang (something missing) cigarettes, hit the table several times. Therefore, because of my matter, I did not criticize your school's affairs. The school authorities should seriously deal with this newspaper. Ding, I will say it again loudly, if "Yu Wuhen" does not fabricate rumors, this fact is truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>It was last Thursday, perhaps. Xu came from Jiangwan, and he only came to see me today. Talking about the Fudan University wall newspaper craze, he said that many people are reading it. He personally saw the "Father and Son" article, and he didn't believe it either. Later, seeing your copy in the newspaper, he thought you were extremely brave. How could you copy this article in front of so many people? Did you memorize it and then write it out from memory? If you memorized it, then your memory is extremely strong. How happy I am!</p>
<p>However, Ding, you shouldn't scold the people who run the wall newspaper anymore. You should know that I also want to run one. I'll also put some money into running it, to make it our organ of expression. I'm very interested. In three or four days, it will meet the public. However, news about our female classmates will not be published, even if there are people like A Fang. I think A Fang is right. She will never become a fickle person. Perhaps she will become an immortal. If she writes "Donggong Chunqiu," this is our common opinion as men. The reason will be told to you later, don't be impatient.</p>
<p>The moon is full. I've been enjoying the moon on the grass every night for the past few days. I've had enough mooncakes. The Fang Yuhe ham mooncakes, Sister Ling asked someone to bring them from Hangzhou yesterday. The taste wasn't bad, but they were all snatched away. You're out of luck. But don't cry. When the moon is round next year, let's go to Hangzhou to eat our fill.</p>
<p>I've written so much to tell you. Writing this letter has dissipated my anger. Ding, after reading this letter, perhaps you will smile through your tears. If your letter was Mei's trick, then you're also angry.</p>
<p>Writing letters by candlelight at night is not good for your health, especially your eyes, which will become nearsighted. Women wearing glasses, I don't think that's good. And staying up late for a long time will lead to insomnia. Ding, don't do this anymore. Listen to me.</p>
<p>I will definitely come to visit your school's 25th anniversary celebration. If you're a greeter and greet the guests, and I am a guest, that would be even more interesting.</p>
<p>I want to visit the autumn scenery of Yeyuan and bring a camera to take a few close-up photos of you. Okay, Ding?</p>
<p>Jia, in West Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Law College Legal Research Association</h3>
<p>Earnestly Requests Ying Chengyi to Give a Lecture</p>
<p>The Law College and Legal Research Association earnestly requested Master Ying Chengyi to come to the college to give a lecture yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The topic was "The Development and Changes of Social Concepts." The listeners were very enthusiastic. The association's members alone exceeded one hundred, and with the addition of other students, the hall was packed. The lecturer was in high spirits, and the listeners listened intently, even after two hours. The atmosphere remained quiet and solemn.</p>
<h3>Weile Garden and Fudan Middle School</h3>
<p>Weile Garden has opened! Dazzling advertisements are published in various newspapers, "This garden will officially open on a certain date. Now, to benefit the academic community, tickets are only two 角(jiao, a unit of currency) of 小洋(silver coin)... Address: Across from Fudan Middle School, Xujiahui, Shanghai." The students of Fudan Middle School, located just a stone's throw away, all want to broaden their horizons. Moreover, it only costs two 角(jiao) for the academic community.</p>
<p>Sure enough, several classmates were attracted by the melodious Western music and intoxicating, sensual dances. One night, they went to admire it together. When they returned, it was already late at night, and the school gate was tightly locked. The gatekeeper was also sleeping soundly. They had no choice but to imitate the "gentlemen on the roof beam" and "enter by climbing over the wall."</p>
<p>The matter was discovered. The school authorities and the Dean of Students frowned. They thought, "If this continues, the school's atmosphere will be unsalvageable, and unexpected dangers will inevitably occur. Who can take on this responsibility?" Therefore, they were so worried that they couldn't eat or sleep well, and spent all day thinking about ways to prevent it.</p>
<p>Finally, they came up with a solution. The school gate is locked at 7:30 PM every night, and no student is allowed to enter or exit again—this is the active measure. If any student goes to visit and rumors are heard, they will be expelled immediately and will not be shown any leniency—this is the passive measure.</p>
<p>Indeed, the solution is exceptionally well-considered. However, many students who are allowed to stay out overnight on holidays still want to sneak in to watch. This is not because the school's management is lax, but because they have lost their spirit of self-governance and disregard their own personalities. Furthermore, it is simply "abandoning themselves to depravity" (Zhuang E).</p>

<h3>On Nationalist Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Gao Wei</p>
<p>Edited by the Vanguard Society</p>
<p>Published by Daguang Bookstore</p>
<p>Since the launch of the "Declaration of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement" by the promoters of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement on June 1st of this year, the Chinese literary and art circles, which had been trapped in a state of abnormal development, suddenly showed a lively atmosphere. Wherever the driving force of this emerging literature and art has reached, it has generally received deep sympathy. On the one hand, the enrichment of the theory of Nationalist Literature and Art is sufficient to establish its indisputable value. On the other hand, it also proves that in such an era, Nationalist Literature and Art is sincerely needed by the general public. However, it is an undeniable fact that the spread of its power has attracted the attention of the Chinese literary and artistic circles. Recently, more and more people from all walks of life have responded to it, which is not necessarily a manifestation of the new vitality of the Chinese nation. However, although the theory of Nationalist Literature and Art has received the sympathy of the majority, it must be deeply understood before we can work together to develop Nationalist Literature and Art. Otherwise, we may step into the danger of misunderstanding or misinterpreting it. In this way, the future of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement may be hindered. Because the current problem requires the establishment of a correct theory and a consistent central idea, then all creations can be pushed forward on this right track. The theories of Nationalist Literature and Art are all seen in the Vanguard Weekly. In the Vanguard Weekly, the general public has already recognized the task of this emerging force. However, it is a pity that this theory has not been collected together, which is not very convenient for the general readers. This book "On Nationalist Literature and Art" can be said to be the first theoretical collection.</p>
<p>In this book "On Nationalist Literature and Art", in addition to the "Declaration of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement", there are a total of seven articles, all of which are for the construction of the theory of Nationalist Literature and Art.</p>
<p>In the "Preface", we are told,</p>
<p>From the point of view of literature and art itself, the production of literature and art comes from the national consciousness of life, and the development of literature and art is motivated by nationalism. This can be proved by the history of literature and art, and there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, in terms of the literature and art needed in the current era, we Chinese only have the requirements of Nationalist Literature and Art. In the current world, isn't it the powerful nations of imperialism oppressing the small and weak nations? Isn't it the powerful nations using empty cosmopolitanism and internationalism to deceive and suppress the right of self-determination of small and weak nations? If we want to make literature and art do a little bit for life and a little bit of justice for the national boundaries, we have to devote ourselves to the development of Nationalist Literature and Art. Especially for our Chinese nation, which is in a difficult and difficult situation under the oppression of imperialism and natural and man-made disasters, we should use Nationalist Literature and Art as the only weapon to break out a main road.</p>
<p>This is true. Nationalist Literature and Art is more generally needed by the objective environment. Now we are asking for a national movement in politics to seek the new life of the nation, but since literature and art has a close relationship with politics, we need the strength of nationalism in literature and art to promote the completion of the national movement in politics as soon as possible. Isn't this an urgent problem?</p>
<p>This includes—</p>
<p>(1) "The Decline of Chinese Literature and Art" first explains the shaking of the old literature and art, the decline of the old literature and art, a glimpse of the new literature and art in the past, the reasons for the decline of the new literature and art, the decline of the new literature and art, and the way to save Chinese literature and art.</p>
<p>(2) "Nationalist Literature and Art" first clarifies the relationship between nationalism and literature and art, and the reasons why our country's literature and art does not take the nation as the center, and then presents the characteristics of Nationalist Literature and Art in its entirety.</p>
<p>(3) "Observing the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement from the Standpoint of the Three People's Principles" is written from an objective attitude, and holds infinite hope for the nascent Nationalist Literary and Art Movement.</p>
<p>(4) "The Chinese Literary and Art Circles Have Recently Adopted a Nationalist Standpoint" made a correct criticism. From the May Fourth Movement to the May Thirtieth Period, to the National Revolutionary Period, to the current literary and art circles, all were given considerable understanding, and rigorous criticisms were made on well-known long and short stories.</p>
<p>(5) "The Literature Required in the Era of Suffering" is to faithfully reveal the vortex of suffering, the reality of suffering, and the psychology of the masses. Secondly, it explains the regression and self-abandonment of literature and art in suffering, and then explains the current problems. Finally, it explains that the only weapon to break through suffering is to use nationalism.</p>
<p>(6) The mission of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement is the most worthy of our attention. The author admits that "politics and literature and art have a close relationship. Politics can influence literature and art, and literature and art can also influence politics." The mission of the nationalist movement in politics is to seek national freedom and equality. The author puts forward the missions of the nationalist literary and art movement, which are planned in the Declaration of the Nationalist Literary and Art Movement: (1) To form the establishment of national consciousness in literature and art, (2) To promote the will of national upward development, (3) To eliminate all thoughts that hinder national progress, (4) To express all the historical stages of national struggle. In the conclusion, the author shouted even more, "We firmly believe that Nationalist Literature and Art can deeply penetrate into the psychology of all members of the entire nation. The Chinese nation will achieve the goal of maturity and excellence. At the same time, the literature and art of the Chinese nation can reach the realm of greatness and immortality." I think this is also what everyone is longing for.</p>
<p>(7) "The Theoretical Basis of Nationalist Literature and Art" discusses nationalism in order, and the meaning of Nationalist Literature and Art are all dissected using analytical methods, making it easier for us to understand after reading.</p>
<p>The above is a brief introduction of the content. Here, I would like to report a piece of good news. The Society has declared that it is preparing to print a second collection of Nationalist Literary and Art Essays, which will discuss nationalism from the aspects of poetry, novels, drama, music, painting, and literary criticism. Secondly, it is preparing to publish several monthly magazines, which will be published soon. They said, "In short, we still have some power, we still have some consciousness. We want to continue to work hard for the movement of Nationalist Literature and Art. We have done the first step, and we will do the second step, and then do the third step..." In this way, let's look forward to it.</p>
<h3>Era Youth</h3>
<p>— Nan Xin</p>
<p>Issues 8 and 9</p>
<p>"Era Youth" is the only youth publication that has emerged in the domestic publishing industry. Its content has a central consciousness of nationalism. Whether it is political or literary works, it gives young people a correct direction. It is definitely not like the strange phenomena that occurred in the domestic literary and art circles not long ago. The articles published in each publication are either full of so-called proletarian ideas, or permeated with decadent, romantic, and classical consciousness. We must know that these ideas and consciousness are completely detrimental to the development of young people themselves, and are like directing them to create a crisis of disrepute for themselves. Further, it is harmful to the future of the entire Chinese nation. The "Era Youth", which has been published to the ninth issue, really wants to help save young people from the various crises that are currently spreading as the primary task. This publication, which has a major mission, deserves our attention. If we want to eliminate the above-mentioned incorrect ideas, we must start from the literary and artistic aspects, because modern literature and art has a close relationship with young people. This is clear to everyone. The two issues of "Era Youth" that I am recommending, which were only recently published, focus on a large category of literature and art, and this is also the main reason.</p>
<p>What deserves our attention most is Mr. Shiren's article "Proletarian Literature and Its Writers". The author used the most economical means to expose the true faces of the so-called proletarian writers, and strongly criticized their literature, which only supports the slogans and slogans of their own class interests. However, in extremely brief words, it has been nakedly and completely described. Therefore, in the present time when young people are wandering in the wrong direction, it is very necessary to produce, and to produce in large quantities, such content that exposes the content and harm of proletarian writers.</p>
<p>The creation of Nationalist Literature and Art that is most active in front of our readers is the poetry containing "the beauty of power". In art, it has reached the high point of expression and tends to study skills, definitely not as shallow and boring as the poetry similar to slogans and slogans. In each issue, "Era Youth" publishes one or two short poems in addition to rigorous papers and sharp miscellaneous reviews. Only it has made art lovers pay attention. Mr. Mei Hongying's "Struggle! Sacrifice!" at one time, is written like this,</p>
<p>We see the battlefield in the north,</p>
<p>Corpses flowing like water,</p>
<p>Bones piled up like mountains,</p>
<p>We see with our own eyes such brave and heroic sons, a tragic scene,</p>
<p>Only by drumming up the blood of the martyrs, walking the road of the crowd,</p>
<p>Revolutionary youth, rise up,</p>
<p>Struggle, sacrifice,</p>
<p>As long as you chant the above-mentioned few lines of poetry, you can see its strength and power in every word, indicating the important responsibilities that young people should bear, how to awaken and struggle. At the same time, we must understand that the so-called sacrifice here, of course, refers to the sacrifice for the struggle of the Chinese nation, because to promote the youth to rush forward is to be inspired by "the blood of the martyrs", and to encourage them. This is certainly a magnificent poem. The others, due to space limitations, I hope readers will appreciate them themselves.</p>
<h3>History of Oppression and Independence Movements of Modern Weak Nations</h3>
<p>— By Zeng Yang</p>
<p>Written by Hu Shiming</p>
<p>The world today, on the surface, appears to be a competition among humans for survival, but in reality, it has become a place where the weak are preyed upon by the strong. One only needs to witness powerful imperialists, relying on their brave and sharp armies, sophisticated weapons, strong economic power, and cunning diplomatic tactics, oppressing weak nations. The saying "annexing the weak and attacking the weary, taking advantage of chaos and insulting the fallen" is the sole intention of imperialists. Generally, weak nations become colonies of imperialists, slaves, cattle, and fish on the chopping block, subject to life and death, exploitation, and the trampling of the strong. Such unequal and inhumane events should cause anyone with a bit of conscience to feel sad and indignant. Especially Chinese compatriots, should have a thorough understanding of the oppression of these weak</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>nations and their independence movements. Because India, Korea, Taiwan, Annam, and the Philippine Islands, among other weak nations, have considerable connections with China based on past history, and some even originated from Chinese territory. This is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's book provides detailed descriptions of the historical facts of how Asia, Africa, the South Seas Islands, Australia, and the Americas were divided by countries like England, Japan, Italy, the United States, and the Netherlands, as well as the progress and current situation of future independence movements. From this, one can glimpse the various practical situations of their struggles for national independence and the suffering of being oppressed by imperialists. Naturally, it can further prompt us to strengthen our determination to fight. Therefore, this book is truly worth reading.</p>
<p>The entire book is divided into five chapters. The first chapter is a general discussion, and the second chapter is about weak Asian nations and their independence movements. This chapter is further divided into eight sections: 1. India; A. The Indian bird's-eye view; B. The history of British invasion of India; C. British political aggression against India; D. Economic oppression suffered by India and its economic relationship with Britain; Resulting in the disaster of extermination and policies to keep the people ignorant; F. Changes in British policies towards India; G. The history of Indian national independence movements; H. The recent situation of Indian national independence movements; 2. Korea; 3. Taiwan; 4. Annam; 5. The Philippines; 6. Arabia; 7. Syria; 8. Dutch East Indies. Each section is further divided into several subsections, similar to those in the first section on India, so they are not copied here. The third chapter is about weak African nations and their independence movements. This chapter is divided into only four sections: 1. East Africa; A. The course of the British invasion of East Africa; B. An overview of British oppression of East Africa; C. The national independence movement in East Africa; 2. South Africa; 3. Morocco; 4. Egypt. The fourth chapter is about European national independence movements. This chapter only has one section on Ireland: A. The origins of the split between Ireland and Britain; B. An overview of British oppression of Ireland; C. The Irish independence movement. The fifth chapter is the conclusion.</p>
<p>The national question, which modern scholars pay attention to, is indeed one of the greatest issues in the world. Therefore, what the author writes in this book is not only about the oppression of the above-mentioned weak nations and the recent situation of their pursuit of national self-determination. At the same time, the author also notes why imperialism wants to invade colonies and where its main reasons lie. Regarding this, the author completely adopts a research attitude, which is also the strength of this book. As a result of the research, it is revealed that imperialism has four major motives for invading weak nations, such as: 1. Obtaining markets to sell goods; 2. Obtaining sources of raw materials; 3. Obtaining investment locations; 4. Solving population problems. From the above four reasons, it can be seen that imperialists use various methods and tactics to invade weak nations in order to achieve their economic aggression. They also carry out political and cultural aggression, luring and threatening, severely oppressing, and falsely placating. They truly leave no stone unturned. The author sharply portrays the oppressed conditions of weak nations, and the ferocious and brutal face and insidious intentions of imperialism, causing us to be shocked and cut to the quick, and to tremble with fear. Especially after the European War, on the one hand, imperialism's oppression and exploitation of weak nations became even more severe than before; on the other hand, the tide of national self-determination surged, and the independence movements of various weak nations emerged like a raging tide. The book describes this point in great detail.</p>
<p>In fact, seeing the brutal situation of imperialists and the spirit of the independence movements of weak nations should at least give rise to a feeling, as Sun Yat-sen said, "We should support weak nations and resist the great powers of the world." He also said, "We not only want to restore the status of our nation, but also to bear a great responsibility to the world... To aid the weak and support the fallen is to fulfill our national duty." These words are so great. Every revolutionary should remember these great teachings. Therefore, we truly need to study the national question without delay.</p>
<p>China is very lacking in studies on the independence movements of weak nations. Apart from a few scattered materials, there is no systematic book. It can be seen that the Chinese people neglect this issue. But in the present situation, we cannot allow ourselves to ignore this issue as we have done in the past. Mr. Hu's book has systematically discussed several relatively important oppressed nations and their recent vigorous independence movements, which can be used as a reference for studying the national question. The glorious history of the independent struggles of weak nations and their spirit of self-determination can also serve as a mirror for our sub-colonized people. The independence of countries such as Turkey and Poland was ultimately realized through great sacrifice and brave struggle. The author's greatest purpose in writing this book is to inspire the spirit of national movement and the upward aspiration of national self-determination among our Chinese compatriots. This painstaking effort and meaning is truly worthy of our admiration and attention.</p>
