<h3>本國史的回顧（民國十九年二月初版世界書局初中本國史）</h3>
<p>歷史是一種研究人類社會延續的活動而認識他變遷進化的因果關係的學問·綜觀本國史上的先民的活動我們可以把他分做四期同時我們又可以把他分　縱横兩方面去觀察他的變遷進化的現象所謂縱的方面便是社會的進化文化的發展和政治的變遷等種種狀况所謂横的方面便是疆土的開拓各民族的接觸與結合和文化的交換等種種情形</p>
<p>第一期是上古自太古至秦之統一卽公元前三世紀初在這一期内</p>
<p>縱的方面貴賤階級由形成而陵夷而破壞農業社會成立漢族文化漸漸發達由胚胎而成熟部落蛻化而成封建封建又破壞而改立郡縣</p>
<p>横的方面疆土由黄河流域而發展到長江流域域内未開化的蠻夷戎狄都受漢族的同化域外並無交通第二期是中古自秦之統一至明季卽公元前三世紀至公元後十六世紀初在這一期内</p>
<p>縱的方面貧富階級漸盛土庶階級由養成而衰落而破壞奴婢制度由確定而漸歸於剷除種族競爭的禍勢日烈戰勝民族和被征民族的階級忽起忽滅上古的巫術至本期而大盛結晶爲方術和道敎佛敎自印度東來而發揚光大漢族文化和印度文化合流政治則成權臣鎮將與帝王爭政篡殺相尋的局面至末期則君權絶對無限專制更加進步</p>
<p>横的方面疆域更由長江流域而發展至粤江流域而確定中國本部的界線西北兩方邊境外的民族侵入到底受漢族的同化和日本南洋西洋及中部西部亞細亞交通頻繁回敎景敎祅敎天主敎相繼傳入</p>
<p>第三期是近世自明季至清季卽公元十六世紀初期至二十世紀初期在這一期内</p>
<p>縱的方面種族競爭仍劇烈漢學極隆盛政治上因君權擴張而呈動摇之象横的方面回藏等族併入中國現在中華民國的彊域遂於本期中確定滿族由隆盛而至於衰落和歐美兩洲的關係日漸接近世界文化也漸次輸入列强帝國主義的侵略至本期末而大盛四境的失地很多</p>
<p>第四期是現代自清季卽約公元一九○五年至最近·在這一期内</p>
<p>縱的方面君主專制巳打倒·但承君主專制的餘毒形成了軍閥紛爭之局面軍閥且和帝國主義者相勾結國民革命的勢力進展以謀打倒軍閥與帝國主義建設新中國</p>
<p>横的方面疆域民族並無變更國際關係日漸密接世界文化輸入益盛和固有文化合流將形成一種對於世界有普遍性對於中國有特殊性的新文化</p>

<p>書報介紹社會學刋第三期  楊紹志　　東南社會學會編輯　世界書局發行　　本期社會學刋的文字除書評和介紹兩欄外可分四類（甲）爲討論研究方法的文字計有三篇（一）喬啓明的中國農民生活程度之研究（二）楊開道的社會調查表格研究（三）毛起鷄的編製工資指數的討論（乙）爲討論學理的文字計有二篇（一）吳澤霖的弱者的心理（二）史則研究發端（丙）爲介紹學說的文字計有二篇（一）李劍華的孔德的生平及其學說（二）葉法無的斯賓格拉的文化史觀及其批評（丁）爲商榷譯名的文字計有二篇一爲學名漢譯一爲人名漢譯均係孫本文先生所提出的商榷共計九篇文字兹就其中摘要幾篇介紹於下　　中國農民生活程度研究　　社會學刋第二期上作者在「農村社會調查的研究」一文中曾經這樣的說過「中國對於社會調查方面—尤其是對於農村方面向來就缺少有系統有條理的研究…」的確事實上雖則有過一些然亦都是外國人牽强附會底調查報告很不確實而陶孟和約的一本北平生活狀况又是都巿附近的情形與其他地方有很不相同的所在不足以代表整個農村的生活狀况所以作者乃從實際的研究在本期中寫出「中國農民生活程度研究」底一文瀰補上述的兩種缺陷　　本文材料係根據金陵大學農林科農業經濟鄉村社會系從民十一年到十四年的四年中在我國各處所調查農家的經濟底和社會底情形記錄調查的期限统係一年調查的方法以每個農家作調查的單位來記載他們過去一年的事實農家的選擇完全以能代表該處一斑生活狀况爲限調查的範圍有河北·河南·山西·安徽·江蘇·福建六省共計十一縣區十三處二千三百七十農家其詳細情形作者製有一表名爲我國六省十三處農家家庭數目平均人口以及成年男子單位數　　作者解釋各項調查的結果的時候他都把美國的情形拿來比較了一下自然在兩種懸殊的狀態之下使我們祇會感覺到中國農産物的毫無進步農村生活的落後　　本文共有表八爲（一）我國六省十三處農家家庭數目平均人口以及成年男子單位數（二）各組年齡各類性别的人稱化爲成年男子單的計算標準（三）我國六省十三處二千三百七十農家平均每一家庭各種物品之總價值（四）我國六省十三處二千三百七十農家每一成年男子單位全年用品的價值（六）我國六省十三處二千三百七十農家平均每一家庭的田塲供給和巿塲購買的各種物品之價值（七）我國六省十三處二千三百七十農家平均每一家庭的田塲供給和巿塲購買的各種物品之百分率（八）我國十處六省一千八百八十七農家之自耕農半自耕農與佃農家庭費用之百分比此外尚有圖四爲（一）我國六省十三處二千三百七十農家各種生活用品分配的百分比（二）我國北部及中東部六省十三處二千三百七十農家各種生活用品分配的百分比（三）丹日美中四國農家庭費用人分配之百分比（四）我國北部及中東部六省十三處二千三百七十農家田塲供給之各種生活用品之百分比較以上各種以事實統計的圖表自然很值得作研究和改良農村生活的參攷　　不過其中有一點我覺得要提出與作者商榷的作者的生活費用之分類依照美國農部經濟專家克兒培屈克（ELKickpatrik）的主張分成大十項把理髮的費用意然包括在個人嗜好底下我以爲不很妥當按理髮係衛生之一自然應當包括在衛生費項下否則亦應歸入雜項内未悉作者以爲如何　　此外作者在結論中又告訴我們關於農民生活所以低落的原因同時定出四項提高農民生活程度的方法總之如編者說「不但事實上給讀者以中國農民實際生活程度的知識而且在方法上給予很有價值的指示　　社會調查表格研究　　本文專着重在社會調查表格的本身上討論作者告訴我們應如何地應用表格應如何地編製表格以及表格的材料的選擇作者有特殊的研究處處有獨到之見可爲社會調查準備工作的指南　　弱者的心理　　强者的心理巳被作者在第一期社會學刋中發表過了作者又在本期中把弱者的變態心理暴露出來作者擇其重要的叙述出來共有七點如次（一）感覺過敏（Hypersenstiveness）（二）自尊心（三）求顯熱忱（四）怨恨（五）自卑心結（InferioiyChnplex）（六）希望心（七）團體忠心r我們自然都知道這許多的特徵並不是弱者所獨有的不過在他們裏面格外的顯著表示的時候往往出之過分流爲變態而巳　　作者在本文中寫到各種變態心理的時候他都舉出許多的事實來證明如在求顯熱忱的一節中有一個很有趣的例證說「從前有一個黑人領袖迦范氏（Garvey）曾竭力提倡黑人去治非洲他們的運動極受一般同種人的歡迎他組織了大非軍隊所有黑人男子都可以加入…………在這種軍隊中官吏極多凡是稍能服務者就可以得爵士做武士這種黑人在白天不過是茶丁脚夫到了晚上在他們自巳的組織中就居然做起官吏來了在白人世界中他們毫無出路在這種組織中他們居然可以佔有很高地位他們求顯心至少可以滿足一部分」總之這種亦可說是帶循環性的强者有失常的態度所以就有弱者的變態心理愈演愈深彼此的行爲也就變成連環式的剌激互相推咎互相仇恨了　　史則研究發端　　作者把史則研究發端一文分爲（一）科學與史學（二）史學之偶然問題（三）史學鳥瞰（四）唯物史觀之新批評和（五）史則之探討五部分來講作者肯定地告訴我們說「研究社會變遷的公例和歷程是史學的最高目的也是社會科學的械共同目的」所以又說「歷史觀點並非與科學觀點有若何之衝突不特毫無衝突而且是相互依倚又不可分離的」　　在第二部分中作者根據學理的立論把胡適之的偶然模倣說梁啓超的以爲社會科學的因果律與自然科學的因果律不同的論調以及曹聚與的適然史觀都下個嚴重的辯正而作者的結論以爲一切歷史上的事實祗要我們加以小心的分析都是可以找出因果的所謂偶然者不過它的原因複雜隱約而巳　　本文末了一部份「史則之探討」作者的結論是「我們的三段論所以是自然是法則的領域人類無論是物理的心理的個人的集合的乃自然的一部分故人類的活動之産生無論是歷史的當代的個人的集合的都不能離開自然的法則」而這篇文字的目的並不提出歷史的任何法則他的用意是「在於說明歷史之自然歷程是有非時間的法則這種法則經過相當的研究是可以發現的」只要從綜合各種社會研究的結果找出自然歷程的法則始　　此外本期中有兩篇學名漢譯和人民漢譯的文字是很值得商榷的近來西方學術思想介紹到我國的巳經是很多可是人名和名詞的譯出各個譯者大多都很隨便以致參差紛雜得不可言狀每令人看得不勝其煩自然標準譯名的需要誰都會感覺到的譯者把社會學名詞及社會學上外國人名釐訂一過於我國研究社會學的人們自然有絶大的貢獻同時就希望各種科學的專家都有同樣工作的貢獻則於我國學術上的進步或即是一種不可藐視的助力某少女  光楣　　沉櫻女士著　　某少女包括五十八封短信從首到底旣没有動人的故事也没有曲折的情節但充滿了無限的熱情這種熱烈的真情的流露决不是一個稍經事故稍失天真的或稍嘗過初戀滋味的少女所能表現出來的她—本書的女人主翁—確是塊純潔的美玉無瑕的美玉她那真摯的天真的熱烈的愛的追求只有使這褪却了天真的我在暗自羡慕但同時又爲她惋惜那樣一位情竇初開的僅十六歲的少女忽爾竟陷她到悲哀的苦海裏嘗受愛的創傷苦味這未免太悽楚了太殘酷了　　本書的情節是這樣的非常單純只是一男一女的主翁這五十八封信統只是女給男的男的是一位尚在大學裏求學的學生女的是一位中學生她倆是在演劇時認識的她的校中開游藝會演劇化裝時請他去擔任指導者就此便被她敬佩深刻的愛慕着在相識後的第二天她便寫信給她了她以她們所演的「咖啡店之一夜」中的白秋與林澤奇作比擬「像劇中秋英敬愛着澤奇一般我現在也是在敬愛着你但不知道我有没有那得澤奇做哥哥的秋英的那幸福有没有和你通信的榮幸」她的年紀雖小但她是多麽地勇敢在相識後的第二天她便寫了這樣一封信給他要求他做她的哥哥這是何等地乾脆她和一班男性追逐女性的一樣在第二封信的稱呼便是「哥哥」「妹妹」了像這樣豪爽的女性却是不易多見這或者唯其她年齡特小而一味地本着她的天真的緣故在她强烈地向他表示着愛的時候他大概是處於某種不得巳的關係於是便下了决心和她斷絶了不過他這斷絶也是因爲愛她的缘故他料定若不那樣的時候她一定會受到更大的失望和痛苦因此後來她寫信給他只是有去無來她那種焦灼·徬徨·苦悶·悲哀的心理狀態完全流露在她那並不長的短信裏尤其是在她從家鄉來到上海來探訪他住在旅館裏守候他的情况她足足等有三天終是不見他來她則苦悶得不堪忍受並且在先她家庭裏知道她在外面有了異性朋友早便中止她來滬的求學了　　作者在「關於某少女」裏說的很詳這五十八封信確是真的事實是一位君給她看的同時在我買這書的時候也有人告訴我是實有其事再看看内容倒使人相信但看小說是不必追求其是事實與否使人看來似乎是真有其事的纔是動人的作品哩本書却很符合這條件　　這是很普遍的在游藝會裏或同演戲劇時往往是獲得戀愛的好機緣是以許多男女同校的學校裏尤其是大學當學生會選舉時竭力競爭在執委分配王作時有三份職務幾爲衆目所共膽第一是常務委員第二是出席代表第三便是游藝部或服的主任這三種職務都是</p>

<h3>Rewarding Anyone Who Can Prove One of the Following Two Items</h3>
<p>(I) The "Review of National History" section in the World Book Company's junior high school textbook "National History" and Chapter 10, the concluding chapter of our Bureau's "New Junior High School National History Complete Book," are nine-tenths identical. Anyone who can prove that the text of this chapter in our Bureau's book was copied from a textbook published by which bureau, resulting in an unintentional coincidence with the World Book Company's book, will be rewarded with one thousand yuan. (The texts of the two books are attached separately below.)</p>
<p>(II) The "Three Kingdoms Standing Together" map and the "Taiping Army" map in the World Book Company's junior high school textbook "National History," and the "Three Kingdoms Standing Together" map and the "Mid-Qing Dynasty and Taiping Army" map in our Bureau's "New Junior High School National History" have completely identical forms and contents. Anyone who can prove that these two maps in our Bureau's book were reprinted from a textbook or historical evolution map published by which bureau, resulting in an unintentional coincidence with the World Book Company's book, will be rewarded with one thousand yuan. (The maps of the two books are attached separately below.)</p>
<p>Concluding Chapter (First edition in August of the 12th year of the Republic of China [1923], approved by the University Council in June of the 17th year [1928], registered with the Ministry of Education in October of the 18th year [1929]. Our Bureau's "Junior High School National History")</p>
<p>History is the record of the continuing activities of human society, clarifying the traces of its succession, so that we can understand our own position and determine our own direction. The activities of our ancestors can be observed from six points in terms of both vertical and horizontal forces, showing their evolutionary signs.</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: the evolution of society, the development of culture, and the changes in politics.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: the expansion of territory, the contact and integration of various ethnic groups, and the exchange of cultures.</p>
<p>Based on these six points, the activities of our ancestors can be divided into four periods for description:</p>
<p>First period: Ancient times: From the establishment of the state by the Yellow Emperor to the unification by Qin. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: distinctions between noble and base classes were formed, then declined and disintegrated. An agricultural society was established, and Han culture developed independently from embryo to maturity. Tribal villages transformed into feudal states, and feudal states disintegrated into commanderies and counties.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: the territory expanded from the Yellow River basin to the Yangtze River basin. The uncivilized barbarians and Rong-Di within the region were all assimilated by the Han people, and there was no communication with foreign lands.</p>
<p>Second period: Medieval times: From the unification by Qin to the unification by Song. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: distinctions between rich and poor classes gradually increased. The scholar-official class, which was formed in the middle of this period, gradually declined and completely disintegrated by the end of this period. The slave system was established. Ancient witchcraft flourished in this period, crystallizing into esoteric arts and Taoism. Buddhism came from India and flourished. Politically, powerful ministers and regional commanders vied with emperors for power, with usurpations and killings following one another.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: the territory further expanded from the Yangtze River basin to the Pearl River basin, establishing the boundary of mainland China. Ethnic groups from beyond the borders of the northwest and northern regions invaded but were eventually assimilated by the Han people. Frequent communication occurred with Japan, Southeast Asia, and Central and Western Asia. Islam, Manichaeism, Nestorianism, and Zoroastrianism were successively introduced.</p>
<p>Third period: Modern times: From the unification by Song to the founding of the Republic of China. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: the disaster of ethnic competition became increasingly urgent. The distinctions between the victorious ethnic group and the conquered ethnic groups arose and disappeared in succession. The slave class also gradually approached elimination. Han culture merged with Indian culture. Absolute imperial power became infinitely despotic, further progressing until the end of the monarchical government. In the first period, those who competed for the throne were the feudal lords; in the second period, those who competed for the throne were powerful ministers and generals; in the third period, those who competed for the throne were different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: the current territory of the Republic of China was established during this period. The various ethnic groups of Manchuria, Mongolia, Hui, and Tibet successively joined to form the foundation of the Republic of China. Relations with Europe and the Americas became increasingly close, and world culture was gradually introduced. The aggression of imperialist powers also increased day by day.</p>
<p>Fourth period: Contemporary times: From the founding of the Republic of China to the present. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: inheriting the remaining poison of monarchical autocracy, a situation of warlord strife was formed, and they colluded with imperialists. The National Revolution arose, overthrowing warlords internally and excluding imperialism externally.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: there were no changes in territory or ethnicity. International relations became increasingly close, and the introduction of world culture became increasingly prosperous, merging with indigenous culture to form a new culture: a new culture that has universality for the world and particularity for China. The first act of the National Revolution has now come to a successful conclusion. All parties are continuing to move forward. How to proceed, how to conduct, how to build so that our country can permanently survive in the world depends entirely on our efforts.</p>
<h3>A Review of National History (First edition in February of the 19th year of the Republic of China [1930], World Book Company Junior High School National History)</h3>
<p>History is a study of the continuing activities of human society and an academic discipline that recognizes the causal relationships of its changes and evolution. Looking at the activities of our ancestors in national history, we can divide it into four periods, and at the same time, we can observe the phenomena of its changes and evolution from both vertical and horizontal aspects. The so-called vertical aspect refers to the various conditions such as the evolution of society, the development of culture, and the changes in politics. The so-called horizontal aspect refers to the various situations such as the expansion of territory, the contact and integration of various ethnic groups, and the exchange of cultures.</p>
<p>The first period is ancient times, from the earliest times to the unification by Qin, i.e., the early 3rd century BC. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: distinctions between noble and base classes were formed, then declined and disintegrated. An agricultural society was established, and Han culture gradually developed from embryo to maturity. Tribal villages transformed into feudal states, and feudal states disintegrated and were replaced by commanderies and counties.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: the territory expanded from the Yellow River basin to the Yangtze River basin. The uncivilized barbarians and Rong-Di within the region were all assimilated by the Han people, and there was no communication with foreign lands. The second period is medieval times, from the unification by Qin to the end of the Ming dynasty, i.e., from the 3rd century BC to the early 16th century AD. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: distinctions between rich and poor classes gradually increased. The scholar-official class developed, then declined and disintegrated. The slave system was established and gradually approached elimination. The disaster of ethnic competition became increasingly fierce. The distinctions between the victorious ethnic group and the conquered ethnic groups arose and disappeared abruptly. Ancient witchcraft flourished in this period, crystallizing into esoteric arts and Taoism. Buddhism came from India and flourished. Han culture merged with Indian culture. Politically, powerful ministers and regional commanders vied with emperors for power, with usurpations and killings following one another. Towards the end of the period, absolute imperial power became infinitely despotic, further progressing.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: the territory further expanded from the Yangtze River basin to the Yue River basin, establishing the boundary of mainland China. Ethnic groups from beyond the borders of the northwest and northern regions invaded and were ultimately assimilated by the Han people. Frequent communication occurred with Japan, Southeast Asia, the West, and Central and Western Asia. Islam, Nestorianism, Zoroastrianism, and Catholicism were successively introduced.</p>
<p>The third period is modern times, from the end of the Ming dynasty to the end of the Qing dynasty, i.e., from the early 16th century to the early 20th century. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: ethnic competition remained intense. Han learning flourished extremely. Politically, the expansion of imperial power led to instability. In the horizontal aspect: the ethnic groups of Hui, Tibet, etc., were incorporated into China. The current territory of the Republic of China was thus established during this period. The Manchu people went from prosperity to decline. Relations with Europe and the Americas became increasingly close, and world culture was gradually introduced. The aggression of imperialist powers became rampant towards the end of this period, and much territory was lost.</p>
<p>The fourth period is contemporary times, from the end of the Qing dynasty, i.e., from about 1905 AD to the present. During this period:</p>
<p>In the vertical aspect: monarchical autocracy has been overthrown. However, inheriting the remaining poison of monarchical autocracy, a situation of warlord strife has formed. The warlords are also colluding with imperialist powers. The forces of the National Revolution are advancing to overthrow the warlords and imperialism and build a new China.</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: there have been no changes in territory or ethnicity. International relations are becoming increasingly close, and the introduction of world culture is becoming increasingly prosperous, merging with indigenous culture to form a new culture that has universality for the world and particularity for China.</p>

<h3>Central Army Encircles Jinan from Three Routes</h3>
<p>The Jin Army Retreated and Gathered North of Jieshou</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>
<p>According to news, on the evening of the 11th, units of the Central Army began to encircle Jinan from three routes. The vanguard of Commander Cai's left flank arrived on the west side of Jinan at noon on the 12th, only a few dozen miles away. At the same time, on the Jiaoji Railway, Han Fuju, Li Baobing, and other units also actively advanced, with one unit crossing the river from Weicheng to the north bank, using artillery to cover a fierce attack on the enemy positions. This was because the tracks near Jinan had been dismantled, and the railway ties had also been removed. Sappers are now being dispatched to repair them, gradually advancing. Zhao Chengzhou's unit, located south of Jinan, has retreated to the rear, and its formation is extremely chaotic. (13th Dispatch)</p>

Late last night, they began to retreat, either by military train or on foot. The vanguard of the Han Fuju and Li Baobing allied forces began crossing the Yun River on the morning of the 12th and continued to advance on foot.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Turkey's Advance into Persia</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I discussed that the relations between Turkey and Persia should be amicable and without mutual blame. Why? Because even though Turkey and Persia have escaped the oppression of the great powers, the great powers will inevitably not be calm and without concerns. Moreover, in today's diplomacy of the great powers, their strategies are complex and ever-changing, allying with one against another, and reversing their positions based on their own interests. If the smaller countries in between do not skillfully maneuver, they will inevitably be disliked by one side, and misfortune will follow. Therefore, it is absolutely not advisable for smaller countries to open new conflicts and give opportunities to others. The history of Turkey and Persia's relations with Russia and Britain is well known, and there is no need to elaborate. The country that once helped us may not end up helping us, and the country that once disliked us may not end up disliking us. If the relations between Turkey and Persia truly break down in the future, how can we predict which great power will help us and which will be our enemy? Turkey's independence was achieved with the help of Soviet Russia. However, according to today's Moscow telegram, Russian newspapers say that the rebellion of the Kurds may lead to the formation of an autonomous state with relations with Soviet Russia. Although it is not yet known what kind of relations will develop, it can be asserted that it will be for the benefit of Soviet Russia and not for the benefit of Turkey. Turkey has long desired to interfere in Persia, but feared that Soviet Russia would stop it from behind. Is the current advance into Persia only for the sake of the Kurdish rebels, or is it thinking of interfering? If its ambitious ambitions are not only to conquer the Kurdish rebels, then the final victory will inevitably not be with Turkey but with the fisherman. This is what we can predict.</p>

<p>A Certain Important Person Discusses the Gold Price Issue</p>
<h3>Nanjing</h3>

It is impossible to fundamentally compensate for this unless production and manufacturing are promoted. In addition to reducing export taxes on domestic products with the principle of one tax per item and no longer levying transit taxes, the Ministry of Finance will also need to formulate separate reduction and incentive measures when the new export tariff is implemented in the future to encourage promotion.

<p>Large-Scale Joint Resistance to the British by Border Tribes in India</p>
<h3>Reuters, North Xiawa, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The overall situation within North Xiawa is currently under control, but the epicenter of the unrest is gradually shifting to Balajina and Kohat, located in the southwest of North Xiawa. There, the Walakzai tribe has joined forces with the Afridi tribe, which is retreating from North Xiawa. The Indian authorities are currently implementing strict plans to deal with it. It is reported that a small number of women and children in Balajina will be transported out by plane.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Simola, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The North Xiawa flying squadron dropped 6,000 small bombs in one day in the areas surrounding Afridi people. The activities of the flying squad prove that the enemy could not advance due to the aerial bombardment. Fewer than 300 people infiltrated North Xiawa by slithering along trenches and ditches. The authorities are confident in their ability to control the overall situation.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Simola, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>On Saturday, 1,500 people of the Muso Tsai tribe attacked the Bataan Ma哨地, north of Homan. They were driven back by the militia and villagers. Yesterday morning, they launched another attack. After some mixed battles, British planes bombed the enemy crowds. According to news from Balajina, the Zhangen tribe attacked the villages and towns of Mannosang and Kaulane. Yesterday, the Balas tribe also launched a large-scale attack on the village of Jichas, killing one villager and three militiamen.</p>
<h3>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The number of people arrested for selling illegal salt is now 74. The non-violent resistance volunteers have suspended their activities for two months. Yesterday, there was another incident in which handcarts loaded with illegal salt were sold along the way, attracting a large crowd. Eventually, there was a conflict with the police, injuring several volunteers. Although the police used batons, they were unable to disperse the crowd gathered in front of the police substation.</p>
<p>Turkish Army Takes Unilateral Action</p>
<p>Entering Persian Border to Suppress Rebellious Tribes</p>
<p>Russian Newspapers Express Deep Concern</p>
<h3>Reuters, Ankara, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The Turkish government is now taking unilateral and vigorous action against the rebel Kurds. General Sali has been ordered to begin an offensive against the rebels who are holding the slopes of Mount Ararat. The Turkish army has now crossed the border and occupied the strategic points on the eastern slopes of Mount Akrida in Persia. It is unknown how the Persian government will respond to this established fact.</p>
<h3>Guomin, Ankara, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>It is claimed that the Turkish army has entered Persia, occupied the various strategic passes on the eastern foothills of Mount Ararat, and has been ordered to defend them in order to attack the Kurdish rebels' base in the mountains. The Persian border guards did not resist, but merely protested the invasion of Persian sovereignty. According to the deadline of Turkey's ultimatum to Persia, the Turkish government approved this move, which is quite surprising to political and diplomatic circles. However, the Persian authorities do not regard this move as hostile, but merely believe that Persia has failed to suppress the Kurdish incursions into Turkey in accordance with the agreement signed between the two countries several years ago.</p>
<h3>Guomin, Moscow, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The Russian press is paying close attention to the Turkish-Persian negotiations, believing that the Kurdish rebellion against Turkey may in the future form an autonomous state and have relations with Soviet Russia. The current deadlock is due in part to Turkey's ultimatum to Persia and in part to Persia's failure to adequately suppress the Kurds. However, if this stalemate continues, the situation will become increasingly tense and will be detrimental to both countries. Therefore, this border dispute should be resolved peacefully. Russia is very willing to act as a mediator.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Actively Expand the Market in South Fiji, Reducing Our Country's Exports to the United States</p>
<h3>Reuters, Douben, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>A Japanese trade delegation arrived here today with thirteen tons of Japanese goods samples such as silk, cotton cloth, electrical appliances, porcelain, utensils, etc., hoping to expand the commercial relationship between Japan and South Fiji.</p>
<h3>Associated Press, Washington, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce recently received a report from its representative in Shanghai stating that the total value of goods purchased by the United States from China in the first half of 1930 was US$66,388,000, while in the first half of 1929, the figure was US$90,576,000. Comparing the two periods, this year's figure is significantly lower.</p>
<p>British Aircraft Exercises</p>
<p>Testing the Driver's Aid</p>
<h3>Reuters, London, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>The 1930 British aircraft exercises began today and will end at 5:00 AM on the 16th. During the exercises, the recently invented driver's aid will be tested. It is reported that aircraft equipped with this device can be driven more accurately during flight, even by drivers who are not the most skilled. This device has been perfected after several years of testing and is of great value for long-distance flights, allowing drivers to avoid the fatigue of long hours.</p>
<p>French Cabinet Discusses Budget</p>
<p>Expenditures Increase Year by Year</p>
<p>National Defense Accounts for the Majority</p>
<h3>Reuters, Paris, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>At today's cabinet meeting, the Minister of Finance discussed the possibility of maintaining a balanced budget. He first stated the general financial situation, and then said that French expenditures increased by 13,000,000,000 francs between 1926 and 1930. The 1930 budget was 5,000,000,000 francs higher than the 1929 budget, but the 1931 budget will exceed the 1930 budget by 6,000,000,000 francs. Debt repayment alone accounts for 48% of revenue. Without new taxes or raising public debt, there will be no way to cover expenditures. The cabinet unanimously decided to re-examine the various items in the 1931 budget in order to find a way to balance revenue and expenditure.</p>
<h3>Guomin, Paris, 12th Dispatch</h3>
<p>It is reported that the majority of the increase in the French government's budget for this year is for national defense expenditures. Therefore, the French press is still skeptical about whether the new budget can be effectively reduced. In addition, the cabinet meeting considered Foreign Minister Briand's report on the European Federation plan and made some revisions to the original plan. It is reported that the memorandum proposing the revisions will be sent to various governments next week.</p>
<p>Seiyukai Economic Survey</p>
<p>Report of the Nagoya Group</p>
<p>The Minseito Will Begin a Major Lobbying Effort</p>
<h3>Dentsu, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch</h3>
<p>Former Minister Kuhara, who was in charge of the Seiyukai Economic Survey Team in Nagoya, returned to Tokyo yesterday and reported that the state of distress in the Nagoya area is very severe. For example, in Seto Town, the main production area of Seto pottery, there were originally nearly 800 chimneys, but only 7 are now emitting smoke. In addition, Hekikai County, which is one of the leading agricultural areas in the country, has completely exhausted its public accumulation funds and savings. Everyone is very worried about how to overcome these difficulties in the future. The county authorities are still promoting that the recession is not as severe as it is, which is extremely strange.</p>
<h3>Dentsu, Tokyo, 13th Dispatch</h3>
<p>As a result of discussions at yesterday's meeting of the Minseito Executive Committee, it was unanimously agreed that the reports of the Seiyukai Economic Survey Team are all false propaganda. Our party must launch a counterattack by sending propaganda and lobbying teams to various places to thoroughly inform the local people of the truth about the financial world and the government's plans. It was decided to hold a large rally in Kanda District, Tokyo on the 20th, with Finance Minister Inoue and Ekida Tetsu and others attending.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>He Jian Sets Off to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>A Changsha correspondent reports that the communists Peng Dehuai and others captured Changsha. He Jian mobilized a large army and launched a multi-pronged encirclement, recovering the provincial capital on the 5th of this month. The bandits fled to the Liuyang and Pingjiang area. Successive troop arrivals in the provincial capital include Liu Jianxu, Tao Guang, Luo Fanying, Wei Suzhong's four divisions and Chen Guangzhong's independent brigade. In addition, the Hubei army Luo Lin's division has reached the line of Pingjiang, Xiangyin, and Yueyang, and the Jiangxi army Zhang Huizan's division has also reached the line of Tonggu, Wanzai, and Xiushui. Coupled with the combined encirclement of the naval and air forces, a situation for a complete and lasting solution has been formed. It is also reported that the Zhu-Mao communist bandits also have a plan to flee west into Hunan to assist Peng Dehuai in harassing Changsha. It is appropriate to take this opportunity to completely eliminate them. He Jian convened Luo Lin, Liu Jianxu, Luo Fanying, Wei Suzhong, Tao Guang, Chen Guangzhong and others in the province yesterday to discuss the strategy for encirclement and suppression. After a decision was made, He Jian personally went to the front to command the troops to advance and suppress them. All combat units are staffed by newly transferred troops arriving in the province. Three routes will be taken to advance and suppress them: the front army will advance directly to Liuyang; the left army will advance to Pingliuyang and contact the Hubei army Luo Lin's division; the right army will advance to Lieliuyang and contact the Jiangxi army Zhang Huizan's division. He Jian himself left Changsha for the front line at 9:00 AM on the 10th to supervise the army. All personnel in the forward command post set out. The rear area security will be handled by Wei Suzhong's 15th Division, with about four regiments stationed in Changsha to be responsible for the security of the provincial capital. Since the 8th, the entire city has been cut off from traffic and a house-to-house search was conducted, capturing more than 100 suspected communist criminals and more than 700 well-known ruffians and local bullies. In addition, more than 400 people were found to be hiding military weapons and public and private belongings, and more than 5,000 pieces of public and private goods and equipment were seized. The joint military law trial division, composed of the headquarters' village cleansing department, the 15th Division, and the 3rd military law office, executed 130 of the primary criminals, and the rest are still under strict interrogation. The traffic blockade was lifted on the morning of the 10th, and people were allowed to pass through the city. Within and outside the city, it was completely cleaned up. On the one hand, the headquarters' village cleansing command planned to build fortresses, artillery platforms, and bunkers on the vital routes of Pingliuyang to consolidate the provincial defenses. After the arrangements were completed, the report was telegraphed to the central government to dispatch troops to suppress the bandits and request severe punishment to apologize to the people. On the one hand, a telegram was sent to all military officers, urging them to correct their previous shortcomings, encourage them to kill the enemy, and preserve the military's reputation. The text of the telegram is as follows: (1) To the Central Party Headquarters, National Government Chairman Jiang, President Tan, President Hu, President Wang, and President Dai, The communist bandit leaders Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Li Lisan, He Long, etc., colluded with the rebel army. Taking advantage of our army's deep penetration into Guilin, they combined with the fierce bandits of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, Kong Hechong and Li Xingshi's various troops, to capture Changsha, burning, killing, and looting, causing darkness to the world. I was appointed to my position, but I failed to meet my responsibilities, causing your concern and the disappointment of the people of Hunan. I am ashamed and grief-stricken. Although I have led my troops to recover the provincial capital, I am mindful of the people's suffering and the difficulty of post-disaster recovery. If I were to plead to resign, it would not only be an attempt to preserve myself, but it would also be difficult to shirk my responsibility. Moreover, the remaining forces have not been eliminated, and they are still gathering. In the event that the Zhu-Mao factions join forces again, Hunan will suffer again, disrupting the provinces along the Yangtze River and harming the overall situation. I have supervised my troops to advance and personally commanded the front line, vowing to eliminate the banditry and slightly atone for my previous mistakes. I am now awaiting punishment and implore you to first impose a severe penalty to uphold discipline. Once the suppression is completed, I will come to Beijing to plead guilty. I am overwhelmed with anxiety and await your orders. Respectfully submitted, He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander of the 4th Route Army of the Punitive Expedition. (2) All officers of this army are aware that the key to governing the army lies in being frank and open, rewarding merit and punishing transgression, enforcing strict discipline, and making finances absolutely transparent. Officers govern from above, soldiers fight from below, and everyone is of one mind, sharing both joy and hardship. Only then can the strength of the army be sound and the command and application be effective. Jianping's training of the troops is always done with this meaning in mind, and it is hoped that we can work together. I sincerely know that the crux of the problem lies in the fact that we must remedy it as soon as possible. Suppressing the communists and bandits is our greatest task. This time, the disaster in Pingliuyang could not be extinguished earlier due to the situation. As a result, the spark spread and Changsha was lost. Public institutions were burned and looted, and the lives and property of the people were sacrificed. It was a unprecedented disaster and a strange shame for the people of Hunan. Although the officers and soldiers suffered many casualties, they were unable to save the city of Hunan. Every time I think of this, my heart aches. Therefore, after arriving in Yuanjiang, I concentrated my troops and actively launched a counterattack. Fortunately, my officers and soldiers fought bravely and arduously to recover Changsha, enabling us to seize</p>

<h3>Continued Important News</h3>
<p>back the industries of Jun Li and Chongan, and reduce our guilt. However, the banditry of the communists is erratic, and we should take advantage of their heavy losses to make fundamental plans for suppression. The frontline operations and the rear area security are equally important, and both depend on whether the strength of the troops is sufficient and whether the will is united, in order to predict future results. An investigation into the internal situation of this headquarters reveals that there are several shortcomings that cannot be avoided, and the repeated setbacks have not been without cause. The sages of the past were pleased to hear of their faults. It is hoped that all officers will reflect on themselves and correct their mistakes if they have them, and encourage themselves if they do not. 1. The finances are often not made public, so the soldiers' salaries and supplies for the division and brigade headquarters are often delayed and not issued. When there are rewards and condolences, the principal officer claims them without publishing any accounts. The actual benefits cannot reach the lower ranks, and resentment is inevitable. Furthermore, the managers may take advantage of their positions for personal gain, with no investigation or accountability. There are even illegal acts such as trafficking in opium and violating the ban, which damage the reputation of the military. This must be thoroughly investigated and rectified. 2. The officers are unable to endure hardship, so the lives of officers and soldiers are too disparate. The officers are accustomed to laziness, and military discipline is difficult to establish. In the event of an accident, the soldiers do not obey orders, and the relationship between officers and soldiers becomes like scattered sand. How can they shoulder difficult tasks and achieve coordinated effects? This must be corrected and revitalized. 3. Not yielding victory and not helping in defeat are major taboos in military affairs, but this army sometimes commits them. It must be known that under the same leadership, it is imperative to be of one heart and mind, sharing weal and woe, setting aside personal views, and taking care of the overall situation, so that the entire strength can be used to deal with the enemy and not give the enemy an opening. This must be handled with harmony and cooperation. In addition, the officers of all departments should pay attention to improving the situation according to their respective circumstances, seek truth from facts, implement rectification, eliminate the habit of following old ways and being sluggish, and promote the style of loyalty, bravery, diligence, and simplicity. Then, not only will the communist bandits be easy to suppress, but all those who endanger our party and country and disrupt our local areas can be dealt with at any time with our sound and elite forces. Forgetting the lessons of the past is a guide for the future. I hope that we can plant good causes and plan for future effects together. Anyone who abandons their duties or abuses their authority for personal gain will be dealt with according to military law once verified. He Jian Seal (August 10th)</p>
<h3>Zhu-Mao Plan to Flee to the Border Between Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Continuous Searches for Communists in Nanchang</p>
<p>A correspondent from Nanchang reports that Zhu Mao, after failing in their plan to seize Nanxun, changed their plan to flee to the border between Hunan and Hubei in northern Jiangxi to join forces with Peng Dehuai. According to news from Fengxin and Jing'an counties, the communist army was originally divided into three corps. Except for the pseudo 20th Army under Duan Qifeng, which is still in Ji'an, the pseudo 12th Army under Wu Zhonghao fled from Anyi and Jing'an to Xiu and Tong. The pseudo 34th Armies, led by Zhu De and Lin Biao, are entrenched in Fengxin. Their organization is divided into three columns per army, each column has three detachments, each detachment has three battalions, each battalion has three companies, each company is a platoon. Each platoon has more than 20 rifles, plus a supplementary battalion, a special service battalion, a heavy transport battalion, and a spear battalion, none of which have rifles. Although there are more than 20,000 bandits, only three to four tenths of them have rifles. Ammunition is very scarce. The maximum number of bullets per gun is four or five rows, or only one row. Each person has a large bag of silver dollars, all of which were plundered. Their combat can only take advantage of the weakness of the enemy and use the spear battalion as the vanguard. When the Zhu bandits were in Anyi and Jing'an counties, the ridiculous proclamations of dividing property and burning contracts were signed by Chairman of the Government Zhu De, Commissioner Mao Zedong, Huang Gonglue, Wu Zhonghao, Chen Yi, Wang Heng, Deng Zihui, Liu Shiqi, Tan Zhenlin, Lin Biao, Fang Zhimin, Peng Qingquan, Shao Shiping, Peng Dehuai, Duan Yuequan, Li Wenbin, and other important figures among the communist bandits. Zhu Mao was wearing old gray cloth military uniforms and mixed into the soldiers, acting very secretly. They carried six submachine guns, four automatic rifles, more than ten Mauser pistols, spears, heavy transports, etc. The team was specifically responsible for kidnapping, looting, killing, and arson, and was directly under the command of Mao Zedong. The provincial authorities are now particularly concerned about the defenses, fearing that Zhu Mao will join forces with Peng He. The martial law headquarters, in view of the fact that the fall of Changsha was entirely due to the internal coordination of the communists lurking in the city, has been searching Nanchang severely in recent days, and has uncovered many communist organizations and arrested many important communist figures. Quite a few of them have been brought to justice. According to official sources, the postal services of Gao'an and Fengxin have been restored. The bandits in Gao'an have fled to Shanggao, while the bandits in Fengxin have invaded Wanzai and disrupted the small shares of Anyi and Jing'an. The troops led by Dai have advanced from Tujiapu on the Nanxun Road to suppress them and have retreated to Xiushui and Tonggu. (11th)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Garrison Command Executes Important Criminals</h3>
<p>Pseudo Division Commander Zhou Zhongya and Public Security Bureau Chief Liu Boqing</p>
<p>A correspondent from Hankou reports that the Wuhan Garrison Command executed two counter-revolutionary criminals, Zhou Zhongya and Liu Boqing, at the gate of Laopu Amusement Park on the 12th. Zhou was the commander of the independent division appointed by Tang Shengzhi and Liu Cheng lie, and Liu was the director of the public security bureau. The crimes are as follows: "According to the report of Huang Zhenxing, the director of the Public Security Bureau of the Hankou Municipal Government, the detectives of the bureau, Ding Zihuang, reported that the secret agents Zhang Bingchen and Chen Guoan disguised themselves and captured the pseudo division commander Zhou Zhongya (i.e., Zhou Ge) and the pseudo public security bureau chief Liu Boqing and presented them to the headquarters. After interrogation by the military law office, they confessed that they were appointed by the reactionary elements Tang Shengzhi and Liu Cheng lie. Zhou was appointed as the commander of the 8th Independent Division of the 6th Route Army of the Republic of China. In Hankou, he colluded with nearby military bandits to connect and launch a riot to occupy Wuhan. After the success of the incident, Liu would be the director of the Hankou Public Security Bureau, etc., which is not denied. The crime is extremely serious and should not be tolerated by law. According to Article 2, Paragraph 2 and Article 4 of the Anti-Revolutionary Law, they should be sentenced to death to show a warning. As for Zhou Kerena Li Meichun Ai Liansheng, the three cases were sentenced separately. In addition to verifying the identities of the criminals, binding them to the execution ground and executing them by shooting, we are obliged to announce the crimes to inform the public, which is as follows: Zhou Zhongya, 22 years old, Hunan native; Liu Boqing, 32 years old, Huangpi native (August 12th)</p>
<h3>The Fujian Provincial Government's Handling of the Lake Yang Aftermath</h3>
<p>Ordered Chen Guohui to Withdraw from Lake Yang</p>
<p>Lin's Troops Escort Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Chen Guohui's troops captured Lake Yang, and over eight hundred militia members retreated to Xianyou territory. Over twenty thousand refugees were displaced in Xianyou. After this incident occurred, representatives from the Lake Yang militia and refugees filed petitions with the Quanzhou Military Commissioner, Fang Shengtao, and the Fuzhou Provincial Government, seeking relief. Yongchun County Magistrate Lin Zupei and people's representative Xu Ruiqing went to the provincial capital and met with Provincial Chairman Yang Shuzhuang. They were received by Chen Peikun, the provincial committee member, and Chen Shoufan, the secretary-general of the provincial government. They agreed on the following measures to be implemented by the provincial government: (1) Immediately order Lin Shuguo, the commander of the 2nd Marine Brigade, to dispatch troops to escort the refugees back to Lake Yang; (2) Send telegrams to Military Commissioner Fang Qingtao and Chen Guohui, ordering Fang to strictly order Chen to withdraw the troops that invaded Lake Yang, and order Chen to immediately instruct his troops to withdraw from Lake Yang; (3) Telegraph Zhang Zhen, the commander of the newly formed 1st Division, to immediately instruct Wang Zuqing, the commander of the 1st Regiment, to enter Yongchun to maintain order; (4) Telegraph the Xianyou and Putian county governments to jointly organize relief for the refugees in the disaster area with the county party headquarters. Lin and Xu immediately returned to Quanzhou. After receiving the provincial government's telegram, Fang Shengtao led a guard and a battalion of the training corps in cars to Yongchun on the 5th, where he will personally urge Chen to strictly order his troops to withdraw from Lake Yang, so that the 2nd Marine Brigade can escort the refugees back to Lake Yang. Lin Shuguo, the commander of the 2nd Marine Brigade, went from Putian to Xianyou on the 6th to find ways to comfort the refugees and escort them back to Lake Yang. Currently, there is no news of Chen's troops withdrawing from Lake Yang. It is heard that Fang will move the Quanzhou Military Commissioner's Office to Yongchun to command the military operations against Lu at close range after Chen complies with the order to withdraw troops. Wang's regiment of the 1st Division will again be dispatched from Quanzhou to Yongchun, and the entire training corps will follow to Yongchun to carry out the operation against Lu. It has not yet been decided whether to leave the 4th Regiment of the 1st Division or the 2nd Marine Brigade in Quanzhou for defense. (August 8th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Shops and Houses Levied Tax</h3>
<p>According to the Tax Rate, the Sales were to be Borne by the Owners.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Due to the urgent need to raise funds in Guangdong Province, it was recently decided to issue 15 million yuan in Financial Reorganization Treasury Bonds. The sales method has been fully allocated, with the largest portion to be sold according to the method of collecting rent and taxes. According to past collections, the highest amount of rent and taxes collected was between 800,000 and 900,000 yuan, and at least 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Now, according to this tax collection method, it should not be difficult to raise 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in treasury bonds. The Finance Department has set tomorrow (the 10th) as the start date for the distribution of treasury bonds based on the rental amount. It has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to implement the method of collecting rent and taxes in the past. The branch bureaus will collect and remit the funds on behalf of the Finance Department, which will give back a certain discount as a handling fee for the staff to encourage them. After approving the letter, the Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday to start the distribution. The notice is as follows: "According to the official letter from the Finance Department of the Guangdong Provincial Government, it was found that in February of this year, in order to quickly raise a large sum of money to maintain paper currency, it was approved by the Guangdong Provincial Government to collect rent for financial reorganization for one month, and it was decided that the Guangdong Central Bank would repay it eight months later. A letter was sent to the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate and handle it, and the collection began on February 26th. It is now found that it will be eight months by October 25th. However, the regulations for the issuance of the Guangdong Financial Reorganization Treasury Bonds of the Republic of China in 1919 stipulate that shops and houses in Guangzhou and Shantou will be levied on a monthly basis according to the rental amount, which will be borne by the owners. This treasury bond was originally scheduled to be issued in August, and the aforementioned borrowing of rent should be terminated early in order to promote the sale of treasury bonds. It is now proposed to end the collection of rent for financial reorganization on July 31st, 1919, and no more collection will be made after that. Starting from August 10th, the financial reorganization treasury bonds will be distributed according to the rental amount for one month. Those households that have not paid the borrowed rent before the end of the collection should recognize and sell the treasury bonds at twice the rental amount, which will still be recognized and offset by the tenants to show the difference. In addition to reporting the date of the end of the financial rent and the start of the distribution of treasury bonds to the Guangdong Provincial Government for inspection and filing, a notice should also be issued to merchants and people so that everyone is aware of it. It should be handled accordingly. It should be handled in accordance with the law in addition to the orders to comply with it. It is necessary to issue a notice to the citizens and people so that those households that have not yet paid the rent for financial reorganization should immediately recognize and sell twice the amount of the financial treasury bonds this time. It will still be recognized and offset by the tenants." (August 9th)</p>
<h3>Draft Organization Plan for Weihai Municipality</h3>
<p>The issue of the return of Weihaiwei has been officially stipulated and exchanged in a special agreement signed by China and Britain. After the exchange, the takeover can be implemented. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to prepare for the takeover procedures, has organized a preparatory office in Beijing and appointed special commissioners to handle everything. On the one hand, Xu Zushan was sent to conduct on-site investigations and has returned to Beijing to prepare a detailed report to be submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ministry believes that if Weihaiwei is converted into a military port after the takeover, the expenses will inevitably be difficult. If it is converted into a county or a city belonging to the province, it will also be related to the status of the area. Therefore, it has been decided to change it into a city directly under the central government. A draft of the organization rules has been prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The draft is as follows: (Article 1) This city is organized in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the City Organization Law promulgated by the National Government and is directly under the Executive Yuan.

The division or change of its area shall be decided by the National Government upon the recommendation of the Executive Yuan. (Article 3) The rights of citizens to exercise the rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum shall be in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the City Organization Law. (Article 4) This city shall handle the following matters: 1. Household registration survey and personnel registration matters; 2. Facilities for childcare, elderly care, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief; 3. Grain reserves and regulation matters; 4. Improvement and protection of agriculture, industry, and commerce; 5. Labor administration matters; 6. Protection and suppression of afforestation, land reclamation, animal husbandry, hunting, and fishing; 7. Supervision of privately operated public utilities; 8. Organization and guidance of cooperatives and mutual aid enterprises; 9. Customs reform matters; 10. Education and other cultural matters; 11. Public security matters; 12.

<h3>Bandits Set Fire to Extort Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Since the southern part of this county has been occupied by bandits, local residents have been extorted. The suffering is worse than that inflicted by the Red Gang. It is now reported that many residents of Fangtangjing have received threatening letters from the bandits. Under duress, they have had to ask people to negotiate payment. However, the three families of Shi Guihai, etc., were unable to pay, which aroused the bandits' anger. On the tenth of this month, a large number of bandits, all armed with box cannons, set fire to their houses. Shi Guihai and others kowtowed repeatedly, promising to pay all the money the next day, after which the fire was put out.</p>

<h3>The County Government Received Orders to Raise Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>The Finance Department ordered the county government and the finance bureau to raise 30,000 yuan in 19th-year cigarette treasury bonds to meet urgent needs, as the provincial treasury was depleted and military expenses were heavy. They were ordered to remit the funds clearly in two installments in the middle and end of this month and must not delay. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Jin has already scheduled a meeting of various legal groups and district chiefs to discuss methods of encouraging donations in order to report the funds on time.</p>
<h3>Yun Jian's First Building Stops Evening Visits</h3>
<p>Yun Jian's First Building in front of the county government was renovated by County Magistrate Jin and has been given a new look. Newspapers and books are provided for people to read. In the summer of this year, it was also open in the evening for the public to climb and enjoy the cool air. However, recently, the people who visit have become complicated, which may cause trouble, and it is already autumn and cool, so the person in charge has ordered the evening opening to be stopped.</p>

<h3>Confessions of the Bandits Who Kidnapped Liu Nianzhuang</h3>
<p>After Yu Baocheng, the kidnapper in the case of Liu Nianzhuang, a broker at the Shanghai Gold Exchange, was captured in Suzhou, he was escorted back to Shanghai for interrogation by Crowe, a western detective from the British Concession, Cao Tingxi (also known as Cao Ashan), a Chinese detective, and detective Ruan Yao, along with two detectives, at 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 13th). Yu confessed that last month, when he was working as a driver for the Xinglong Motor Company, someone nicknamed "Motor So-and-so" came to him and asked him to rob opium. He replied that he would not go. So-and-so then asked if he would go kidnapping. He said he was afraid of being caught and shot. So-and-so said that he would not be caught. He happily agreed because he could get a large ransom by kidnapping a rich man. He immediately followed So-and-so to a room on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on Six Malu Road. He did not remember the room number. At that time, there were two other people in the room, one of whom was also a motorcar driver. The meeting resulted in a decision to kidnap Liu Nianzhuang. They then went together to Beichengdu Road. He, wearing a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and trousers, sat on the cement floor opposite the Liu residence and watched Shen Bao. The other three, all dressed in short clothes, waited nearby for the Liu family to come out. Not long after, Liu and his wife came out and got into a car. So-and-so winked at him and ordered him to take action. He jumped into the car, took out a gun, and forced the driver of the car to get out. So-and-so and the others also got into the car and used guns to watch over Liu and his wife, who were too frightened to make a sound. He drove the car to a deserted spot in Hongkou, pushed Liu's wife out of the car, and told her to quickly prepare the money for ransom and not to call the police, otherwise they would tear up the ticket. Afterwards, the car drove to the Yangshupu organ (i.e., the bandit's den). He then returned to the Xinglong Company. Because there was news in Shanghai, he fled to Suzhou with his wife, Peng. At that time, Liu had not yet been released.</p>
<h3>Fengxian Prison Guard Sent to Shanghai Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>In the case of the escape of 58 prisoners from Fengxian County Prison last month, Lin Biao, the president of the High Court, sent judicial commissioner Yao Guozhang to investigate, who has already returned to the court to report. After reviewing the report, President Lin held that Liu Ou, the prison guard of the county, was inevitably negligent in advance and ordered the county magistrate to transfer the prison guard Liu to the Shanghai District Court for investigation and legal action.</p>
<h3>Zheng Xiaogong Accused Again</h3>
<p>Zou Xiaogong, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, was previously accused by citizen Wang Shi in a written petition of employing private individuals and other matters, requesting his dismissal. County Magistrate Fei ordered Du, the police captain, to investigate and reply. Recently, citizen Yu Tuiyuan suddenly submitted a petition to the Department of Civil Affairs, accusing him of abusing private individuals and arbitrarily establishing officials, etc. After receiving the petition, Director Hu of Civil Affairs yesterday ordered the county government to investigate and reply according to the facts.</p>
<h3>Reactionary Cases Ordered to be Sent to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>

County Magistrate Huang has also reported to the provincial government. Yesterday (the 13th), the provincial government ordered the county government to order the Public Security Bureau to send Zhang Yiming and Wang Youru to the garrison headquarters for handling, and the rest to the judicial authorities for handling. After receiving the order, Director Zou stated that Wang Youru, Li Zhen, Zha Boming, Deng Wei, Deng Xian, Jiang Bian, and Chu Weibin, etc., had all been released on bail, so they must be summoned before further action is taken.</p>

<h3>Robbery Case at Sun Lane: Criminal Suddenly Retracts Confession</h3>
<p>In the case of the robbery and injury of Sun Leikui and his son Sun Chunda, residents of Sun Lane in the 16th District (Wan'an), the bandits He Genfu, He Genxi, Yu Xingsheng, and others were arrested and confessed to the robbery and theft of the loot. However, He Awu, the mastermind of the case, suddenly committed suicide out of fear of punishment. The county government, based on the report from Sun Yong, the head of the district, sent Zhou, a trial officer, to inspect the body in a cypress tomb under the Yingqiao Bridge. It was verified that he had strangled himself before his death and did not hang himself. The mother of the deceased, He Yu, stated that the deceased Awu was 22 years old, wandered around and did not engage in proper work, and was willing to be buried in a coffin. Zhou, the trial officer, immediately ordered the district head Sun Yong to prepare a coffin for burial. At the same time, the county police team continued to capture a gang member named Bian Baolin, and together with the three criminals Yu, He, and He, they were all sent to the county for interrogation by Zhou, the trial officer. Unexpectedly, Yu and the others claimed to have been wronged during the interrogation and completely denied the instigation of anyone, the robbery, and the amount of loot distributed as confessed in the county police team. When asked why they had confessed so firmly in the Fifth Brigade, they all stated that they had been tortured and made random confessions. They tightly wrapped their wrists with wet hands and tied their hands backwards with ropes, pulling them up high. They were hanged three times and died three times. When speaking, the three raised their wrists together to ask for verification, and the scars were clearly visible. When asked about Bian Baolin, he said that he was supporting the Qianzhou shuttle boat and had not committed any theft. This time, he was arrested at home, and the whole village was calling for justice for him. Fortunately, he had not been tortured. According to the confessions, Zhou, the trial officer, stated that the scars on the wrists of the three were real, but why did He Awu commit suicide at this time, and He Genfu and Genxi were Awu's cousins, and there were clues to be found. It was recognized that the case was bizarre and complex and had great research value. The four criminals were ordered to be detained pending investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Borrowing Money for the Northern Section of the Xicheng Road</h3>
<p>Mao Feng, the director of the Jiangyin County Construction Bureau, stated that the southern section of the Xicheng Road had been completed long ago, but the northern section urgently needed to be actively constructed. Although the culverts and bridges had been built, the department strictly urged that it be opened to traffic by the end of the year. It was estimated that at least 70,000 yuan was needed, and there was still a shortage of 40,000 yuan from various plans. He came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to contact the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company to discuss the matter. As a result, the company has agreed to lend 10,000 yuan, and the remaining 30,000 yuan will have to be resolved after the company's shareholders meeting.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the District Chief's Delayed Handover</h3>
<p>There are a total of 17 districts in this county, with 17 district chiefs. After taking office on August 15th of last year, they completed a three-month probation period and were officially appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs. Subsequently, County Magistrate Sun Zuji assessed the daily work of each district chief and added comments, which were reported to the Civil Affairs Department for review. By the summer of this year, Su Wenbin (Weibin), the district chief of the 6th District, was repeatedly accused by people to the provincial government for his bad deeds. He was dismissed by the department and replaced by Feng Junyan, a graduate of the second class. The other district chiefs, Zhu Chenghong of the 2nd District, Zhu Biao of the 4th District, Yuan Fengqi of the 10th District, Peng Shikui of the 15th District, and Zhang Zongqi of the 16th District, needed to be transferred to the province for training. Except for Zhu Biao, who was approved by the county to be exempted from training, Yuan Shikui was transferred to the province for examination and may also be exempted from training. The remaining three, Zhu Chenghong and others, must be transferred to the province for training. Yuan Fengqi (Yongshang) and Zhang Zongqi have already handed over their positions. Zhu Chenghong has advanced a lot of public money since taking office, and the county government has not issued any district subsidy funds for the first half of August, making it impossible to repay the money, so he delayed the handover. Zou Qingxiang, the acting district chief, had no way to take over and went to the county to ask for instructions. Qian Zhongliang, the district chief of the 1st District, accompanied acting district chief Zou to allocate the subsidy funds for the first half of the month before accompanying acting district chief Zou. Since August of last year, he has borrowed and advanced a lot of money due to the depletion of funds. Once transferred to the province for training, he must repay the money in fact, so there has been a delay in the handover.</p>
<h3>Electricity in the Entire County Goes Out Again</h3>
<p>The electricity in Wuxi went out twice on the 7th of this month due to the impact of thunderstorms. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 a.m. yesterday (the 13th), due to strong winds and thunder, followed by heavy rain, the electricity in the entire county suddenly went out again at that time. By 5:00 a.m., it had not yet been restored. The Zhenxin Yarn Factory and other machinery foundries in the city relied on electric current to operate their machines. Since the current was cut off, they all stopped working. After investigating, the Electricity Business Unit of Qishuyan Power Plant found that the porcelain bottle lines near the suspension bridge outside the West Gate and between Henglin and Luoshe were destroyed by lightning. Craftsmen were immediately sent to repair them separately, and they were not repaired until 1:00 p.m.</p>

They immediately reported to Li Mianqiu, the leader of the nearby police team, who led the police to encircle and arrest them on the morning of the 11th. It was learned that the bandits were secretly meeting in a certain opium den. They immediately broke in and searched. When they saw that the situation was not good, they hurriedly escaped through the side door. Only Ding Genlin was captured and taken back to the bureau. Along the way, the villagers revealed his evil deeds. That night, he was escorted to the squad headquarters and transferred to the city brigade headquarters on the 12th for interrogation.</p>

Zhao went to take over his post on the 13th. Inspector Xu Shengtong was temporarily appointed to act as the patrol officer of the First Branch and Third Branch Office and went to take over his post on the afternoon of the 12th. The patrol officer of the First Branch and Fourth Branch Office, Cheng Zhuozhang, was transferred with Zhang Xi'an, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau.</p>

Yesterday (the 11th), it had been approved for filing.</p>

<h3>Two Important Bandits Searched and Captured in Western Xiang</h3>
<p>After the bandits in Shizhuang, Western Xiang, set fire and robbed, County Magistrate Li and the chief of the Public Security Bureau led a team to search the countryside. Yu Bingqing and Wu Jinkun, two bandits, were captured in Chou Village. They had previously transported box cannons for the bandits. The night before, Director Li of the Public Security Bureau and Captain Li went to Jiajiatou to search the high school students, but they had already fled. It is said that the bandits used children to pass messages, and there were also secret agents in the city who were difficult to capture because they communicated with each other. Yesterday (the 12th), Chen Jingchen and others, representatives of the Western Xiang Office, went to the county government to petition for the handling of the aftermath. After deliberation, the county government decided that the Construction Bureau, together with the Western Xiang Office and the Telephone Bureau, would install temporary telephones in Shengang, Shiqiao, Chou Village, and Ligang, and offer a reward of 500 yuan for the arrest of the high school students who were bandits.</p>
<h3>Dishonest Merchants Transporting Rice Cause a Disturbance</h3>
<p>It has come to light that Xia Er Laizi, a local unscrupulous merchant, had been colluding with dishonest merchants in Huaiyin for several years, privately transporting large quantities of rice for export. The former County Magistrate Dong had previously investigated and dealt with the case, after which Xia ceased his activities. Now that the new rice has entered the market and rice prices have eased, Xia has returned to his old ways, once again colluding with dishonest merchants in Huaiyin to engage in export operations on a large scale. He secretly contacted Tongyu in the city, planning to transport 5,000 shi of new rice. Unexpectedly, due to the famine of the past year, the porters are resentful that the dishonest merchant disregarded the people's food supply by privately exporting rice, causing a shortage of grain in the area and forcing them to eat expensive rice and rely on green bean dry rations, causing great suffering. It is now reported that the dishonest merchant is transporting rice north, leading to widespread opposition. At 7:00 AM this morning, many porters gathered, banging on kerosene cans and shouting along the way that they would not carry the rice. They also jointly petitioned the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to maintain the people's food supply and prevent them from being affected by expensive rice again, as if they were bandits trying to rob and commit crimes.</p>
<p>The 1st Platoon of the 1st District Defense Corps stationed in Shaojia Village received a report on the 8th that over 20 bandits were holding a meeting at Ge Xiantai's house in Dengjia Bridge. They immediately led a team to search and arrest them, capturing two important bandits, Xiao Wenbiao and Chang Xingsheng. Subsequently, they received another report that a bandit named Ge Cunyu was hiding in the Shihjia Wasteland. Squad Leader Xue ordered the corps soldiers to go to the address and arrest Ge Cunyu. All three were taken back to Shaojia Village for interrogation. They confessed to joining the bandit gang and kidnapping two children from Gu Deyuan's family, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. They also confessed the names of many accomplices. Following the leads, they successively arrested Xie Kun Da, Qiao Sheng, Jiang Jia Shi, and others, and rescued the two kidnapped children of the Gu family. Yesterday morning, all were escorted to the corps headquarters for interrogation. However, when they reached the eastern end of Kongjia Bridge, suddenly more than 20 bandits appeared and tried to rob them. The escorting corps soldiers, fearing that they were outnumbered, immediately killed the two important bandits, Xiao Wenbiao and Chang Xingsheng, and opened fire to resist. Fortunately, Squad Leader Yang heard the news and led a team to arrive, repelling the bandits. The remaining bandits and the two hostages were sent to the corps headquarters and then to the county for interrogation.</p>

After a detailed investigation by Prosecutor Xu of the court, he was ordered to provide a reliable guarantor for temporary release on bail. It is reported that the reason for the transfer to the court was that he was accused of corruption, leading to the Civil Affairs Department sending personnel to investigate thoroughly. They believed that he had falsely reported administrative and judicial expenses, and that the interest income from the collected surplus funds had not been reported to the province for verification, which raised suspicions.</p>

<p>Recently, bandit leaders Yang Chuanxi and Xiao Meng have gathered hundreds of bandits in Linhai Eastern Countryside, kidnapping people and demanding ransoms along the villages, causing great panic. County Magistrate Hou Changling and Battalion Commander Dong of the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Security Corps received reports and immediately dispatched Security Corps Platoon Leader Han and Xu Junqing, the leader of the 1st Squad of the County Patrol Team, with 50 soldiers to assist in the suppression. The team arrived at Baishuxia in this township yesterday (the 8th) morning and heard dense gunfire, indicating that Commander Hou's troops were in contact with the 50-60 bandits led by Yang Chuanxi and Xiao Meng, the bandit leaders of Chadong. The two teams then attacked from both sides, and the bandits, unable to resist, were defeated and retreated to the Shanluo Mountains, crossing Xiaoling and fleeing towards Dongkeng. At that time, one bandit was killed, and his head was cut off and sent to the battalion headquarters by the Security Corps.</p>

<p>Chinese Expedition Team Defeats Nongchuan Team</p>
<h3>Three to One, Seventh Battle Record</h3>
<p>Cao Guicheng Scores Two Goals Alone, Chen Yutian Plays and Contributes</p>
<p>(Nongchuan Telecommunication, July 29th) After the Chinese expeditionary soccer team suffered a crushing defeat of two to six in the battle with the bar players on Sunday (July 27), people in Nongbu heard that many players of the Chinese team were sick and injured, and there were no reserve personnel for no reason, and it was expected that the battle with the Nongchuan team would inevitably be defeated again, and the income would inevitably be greatly affected. The pre-sold tickets were only sold for 3,000 shields the night before the battle was about to begin. However, the overseas Chinese compatriots living near the port admired the art of the Hua team's athletes. Although they suffered a crushing defeat, they were still eager to come and visit because the opportunity was rare. Therefore, on Tuesday (29th), the traffic in Nongchuan Port was busy, and the hotels were full. Even at 12 o'clock at night, there were still people who had not found a hotel. The one-day income suddenly increased from 3,000 shields to more than 12,400 shields. This shows how much the compatriots valued the art of the Hua team. On that day, the audience arrived in the afternoon. The scene was extremely crowded due to the narrow road. At 4 o'clock, the entire field was full of standing positions, and the special seats were already full. At 4:30, the Hua team entered in formation, and the military band played music to express welcome. After changing clothes in the dressing room, they were led into the field by Captain Li. The audience applauded to pay tribute. Then the players of the team entered, and the applause rose again. After the two teams took pictures, the referee He Dingski blew the whistle to gather the teams and choose the field. The Hua team occupied the east, and the players of the team occupied the west. The Hua team's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, Liang Rongde, Sun Jingsi, Chen Zhenhe (above), An Yuansheng (below), Chen Guangyao, Li Huitang, Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, Cao Guicheng.</p>
<p>Mobilization Order Issued, Second Army Opens Fire</p>
<p>After the field was selected, the two sides waited in formation. At 5:45, the mayor of Nong entered the field to perform the opening ceremony. After the police whistle sounded, the battle broke out. Center Dai received the incoming ball and dribbled it straight up. However, when he met the enemy's forward, he was snatched away and passed back to the right wing to try to attack. However, when he reached the Hua team's defense line, he was blocked by center defender Sun. The counterattack was launched, and the momentum was surging, directly approaching the goal line. However, he missed the opportunity due to his foot not responding to his orders and sent the ball out of bounds. The goal keeper of the Nong team passed the ball into the center. One attack and one defense made good use of the skills on the top. At this time, the strategies of the two sides were undecided, and there was nothing exciting to see.</p>
<p>General Cao Breaks the Formation and Scores the First Goal</p>
<p>At 4:49, Chen Yutian received a supply from the rear and passed it to the center. Seeing that General Cao was not guarded, he took the opportunity to pass the ball. After receiving the ball, General Cao broke the formation like lightning and went straight in, approaching the goal and shooting hard. The ball went into the net, and the applause of the entire audience was like thunder. Then, the Nong team launched a large-scale counterattack to seek revenge for losing a goal. However, defender Li's defense was tight, and it was difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>Chen Guangyao Misses a Good Opportunity in Front of the Goal</p>
<p>At 4:53, Chen Guangyao received a strange pass and went straight up along the side. Seeing that there was no one on the defense line, he turned into the inner side and approached the goal and shot hard at the goal. The shot exceeded the range and touched the goal out of bounds, and the opportunity was lost. Since then, the goal of the Nong team has been under attack, and dangerous balls have been frequent. After the heavy siege was lifted, the enemy team came back again. At 4:57, Li Qiusai saw an opportunity at the goal and raised his foot to shoot remotely, only winning a corner kick, but it was not effective. Although the enemy team tried to counterattack, they were mostly blocked by the defense line, and Zhou's iron gate rescued quickly, making it difficult to succeed.</p>
<p>Feng and Li Two Guards Reject People Thousands of Miles Away</p>
<p>At 5:02, Chen Zhenhe received the incoming ball and rode alone, breaking through one or two defense lines. Unfortunately, his foot did not respond to his orders and he shot it out of bounds. After receiving the ball, the front line of the Nong team came to invade the Hua team's goal, all of which were rejected by Generals Feng and Li. At 5:10, General Cao broke the formation alone and went deep into the heart of the enemy. The defense army chased from behind. Before General Cao could raise his foot, he was blocked and passed back to the center. Although the left wing was fast, it was futile to work hard because the shooting was not skillful.</p>
<p>Chen Yutian Enters the Field and Achieves a Miraculous Achievement</p>
<p>At 5:12, General Cao received the incoming ball from the rear and went straight up along the side. After passing the defense line, he immediately passed it to the center. Chen Yutian ran to see that the goal was close at hand and took advantage of the situation to shoot slowly at the corner of the goal. The ball went into the net, and the applause rose greatly, and the shouts increased. Then, after a few minutes of fighting, the referee blew the whistle to rest, and the first half ended with the Hua team taking a 2-0 lead. The iron gate was consolidated and turned danger into safety.</p>
<p>At 5:25, the battle broke out again. Chen Zhenhe's injury recurred and he did not play again. An Yuansheng supplemented the quota. At this time, the two sides attacked and defended fiercely to decide a victory. The Hua team's defense line was mostly injured, so the defense was not effective and the enemy often broke through the formation directly. Fortunately, the iron gate was consolidated to turn danger into safety. The Hua team's forwards repeatedly missed good opportunities.</p>
<p>At 5:20, center Dai received support from the rear and rode alone, shooting hard at the goal, only winning a penalty corner, but it was not effective. At 5:54, center Dai came again. The enemy came to block the way. Dai passed the ball to the right, also only winning a penalty corner, but it was not effective. The enemy team passed the ball. Because the defense army of the Hua team was transferred and did not return, the rear was empty. The enemy took the opportunity to drive straight in. An Yuansheng was unable to stop it, and the situation was dangerous.</p>
<p>Sun Sijing Solves a Thousand Worries with One Kick</p>
<p>To a considerable extent, the center Zhou's iron gate came out to rescue, but he could not turn around, and the ball went towards the goal. The audience was extremely worried when they saw this.</p>
<p>With a sound, Sun Sijing ran up and hooked his foot and crossed the boundary. The corner kick was not damaged either.</p>
<p>Fu Xiangqing Replaces Liang Rongde</p>
<p>At 5:37, the enemy team attacked fiercely. Liang Rongde tried his best to resist, and his knee was injured and he fell to the ground. After being carried out, Fu Xiangqing entered the field to supplement the quota. Fu's guard was naive and often made mistakes. The enemy took advantage of the weakness to counterattack, and the Hua team's goal was in urgent condition. The forward returned to the army too late. The left wing dribbled the ball forward, and the rear guard went up to cooperate with the government. When the right wing passed the ball, the Hua team's defense was careless, and the enemy's rear guard was able to approach the defense line. Carelessness was restored by one goal.</p>
<p>At 5:43, the rear guard caught up and saw the ball coming from the left wing. He stretched his head and hit it. Zhou's iron gate was unable to rescue it, and the ball went into the net. The Dutch audience applauded greatly. Then, the two sides fought again with equal strength. The ball went east and west, and there was no fixed direction.</p>
<p>General Cao Re-establishes Merit</p>
<p>At 6:00, General Cao received the incoming ball and broke the formation straight into the appropriate location. He then unleashed a fierce shot towards the goal. The enemy's goalkeeper dove to rescue it, but the ball still went into the net with a resounding crash. The entire audience cheered and applauded. Subsequently, the enemy team attempted a desperate stand, but as the time had already elapsed, their objective could not be reached. After only a few minutes of battle, the referee whistled to conclude the game. The entire audience dispersed in joy. The team members drank ice water to quench their thirst before returning to the field to receive their awards and trophy. After receiving them, they left the field and returned to their residence, while the spectators dispersed and returned home.

<p>Men's and Women's Basketball Game at 7:00 PM Today</p>
<p>Liangjiang vs. Jiaotong University Team</p>
<p>At the Chinese Basketball Hall</p>
<p>Today (14th) at 7:00 PM, the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team will compete against the Jiaotong University Basketball Team at the Chinese Basketball Hall on Father Lao Road. The men's rules will be adopted. The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team is already the best women's team in Shanghai, and no other women's team can compete with them. Now, in order to improve their skills in a comprehensive way and to adapt to the social trend, the team is also working hard to practice the men's rules. They once defeated the Shanghai Sports News Reporters Group in a trial match. The Liangjiang team is the first in China to adopt the men's rules for women's basketball. The team will play a friendly match with the Jiaotong University Basketball Team again today. The strength of the Jiaotong University team is originally considered strong, but judging from the recent results of the Liangjiang team, the outcome is difficult to predict. In short, there will definitely be a fierce battle. At 6:00 PM, the Nanguang Team will compete against the Hunan Team.</p>

<p>Xuyuan Random Notes</p>
<p>Tianxu I Sheng</p>
<p>Young children like to listen to stories and often ask questions about the bottom line. For example, which came first, the chicken or the egg? To this day, no one can answer. I said that there must have been an egg first. This is the so-called oviparous. It has already entered the third stage of biological evolution. The first stage is hygrogenesis, and the second stage is metamorphosis. For example, the larvae in the water, its initial physiology is actually caused by microorganisms falling on the water surface from dust and sensing the damp heat. If the water surface is covered with oil, there will be no physiology, which is clear evidence. Therefore, the larvae are hygrogenesis, and their generation and survival are in the water, sensing the current effect in the water temperature, and absorbing sunlight and air on the water surface. Then they develop and generate changes, and then metamorphose into two-winged mosquitoes, which is metamorphosis. When they become mosquitoes, they can eat blood. Then they lay eggs and hatch seeds between the grass and dew, and then oviparous. A kind of flower-legged giant mosquito does not necessarily come from the water, which is also oviparous. Therefore, to solve this problem, only mosquitoes and larvae can be used as an analogy. Mosquitoes are metamorphosed from larvae, and larvae are derived from mold in dust and hygrogenesis. Therefore, in the earliest stage, there must be an egg first. The generation of this egg must be in a stone gap, because its shell actually contains limestone. The yellow and white in it, which becomes the flesh and blood, is mostly caused by the corruption of plants and accidentally forms a mass due to wind media. Because it contains the quality of phosphorus salt, it can dissolve limestone, which is to adhere to the surface. It is hardened by wind and sun, which is the same as the live insects in chalcanthite and amber. However, when talking to young children, it is advisable to lower the mother's high opinion and use the metaphor of larvae transforming into mosquitoes, which is to start the gradual process of exploring principles and knowing everything as an example of learning by analogy.

<p>Local News: China Merchants Bureau Jin Li Yuan Wharf:</p>
<p>San De Tang Takes Advantage of Danger and Abandons Contract:</p>
<p>Special Historical Significance in Diplomacy:</p>
<p>French Public Concessions Distort and Judge Unfairly:</p>
<p>Request Government Assistance and Relief:</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau Jin Li Yuan Wharf is a well-known wharf in China and is related to the lifeline of the China Merchants Bureau. All people in the country know that it is the property of the China Merchants Bureau. However, according to investigations, after the Sino-French War, due to diplomatic failure, sovereignty was ceded to the French Catholic Church San De Tang. At that time, negotiations lasted nearly ten years, and only the right to lease the land was obtained. Recently, the French Catholic Church San De Tang, on the pretext that the China Merchants Bureau paid the rent late (delayed by four days), abruptly cancelled the lease contract, which was scheduled for fifty years. The two parties were involved in a lawsuit, and the French Public Concession court, in a private manner, ruled to cancel the lease contract. The China Merchants Bureau considers this industry to be of great importance to the shipping industry and cannot let it go. It has already requested government assistance. It is found that this case is of unusual importance to the country and society, and it is not only a local problem of the China Merchants Bureau. The original manuscript of the letter to the Ministry of Communications is copied from the China Merchants Bureau and attached below as a presentation for the Shanghai French Concession Joint Court to distort the lease contract, judge unfairly, take advantage of danger and abandon the contract, infringe on the shipping industry, please transfer it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for prompt advice to the French Consul to practice the previous French Envoy's letter of faith to stop the Public Concession court from execution and to take care of international friendship. The Office of the Bureau leased land from the French Catholic Church San De Tang in 1890, located at No. 69, 69 (B) of the Shanghai French Concession Public Works Bureau, north to Dagu Road, south to Fujian Road, and west to Yangxing Street, including the right to exit the river. The lease term was set for twenty-five years, starting from January 9, 1892, when San De Tang completely handed over all the houses in the contract to the Bureau for use, and ending on January 9, 1917. In December 1916, the lease contract was renewed for a term of twenty-five years, starting from January 9, 1917, and it was stipulated that it could be extended for another twenty-five years after the expiration. This leased land has a special historical significance in diplomacy. From the 7th year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty to the 16th year of Guangxu, the Bureau filled the tideland and obtained the increased tax stamps (copies No. 1 and No. 2). Later, the tax stamps were cancelled and the lease contract was negotiated. During the ten years, the ministers of the North and South Oceans and the Shanghai French Consul-General exchanged documents, first refuting and then discussing (copies No. 3 to No. 17). Finally, the most shameful "cessation of disputes and promotion of amity" in diplomatic history was used to sacrifice the Bureau's huge expenses of more than 600,000 taels for filling the tideland. The condition was to revoke the land increase tax stamp obtained by the Bureau in April of the 9th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, and only exchange for the right to lease the land with the French Consul-General's repeated statement that there was no obstacle to the China Merchants Bureau Jin Li Yuan Wharf (copies No. 18 to No. 20). Initially, the annual land rent was 7,000 taels, paid in four seasons. The renewed rent was changed to 8% of the land price estimated by the Public Works Bureau or other authorities authorized to estimate the land price, and it was still paid in four seasons. Regarding the relief for rent arrears, Article 10 of the contract stated that "At any time, if the lessee does not pay the rent in advance quarterly in accordance with the provisions of this contract, the lessor may re-occupy the house after the lessor's notice is invalid, and may use other methods that the lessor deems appropriate to collect all the rent stipulated in this contract." (copy No. 21) Unexpectedly, last year, the Bureau's income from shipping supplies for military use was sharply reduced, and the government subsidies could not be received in full, resulting in the inability to pay the winter rent on schedule. However, since the last notice from San De Tang to the Bureau on October 24 of the 18th year, it has been borrowing money in various ways. It paid part of the rent arrears before the deadline of October 31 set by it, and the San De Tang actually declared that the lease had expired on the day of collecting part of the rent arrears and ordered the land to be returned. The Bureau considered the wharf to be very important to the shipping industry and did not think that the exchange of this lease right had a special historical significance in diplomacy, and there was also the solemn statement from the French Consul-General that there was no obstacle to the China Merchants Bureau Jin Li Yuan Wharf. Although San De Tang abruptly made a statement to obliterate the diplomatic history, it may still have some consideration for the old friendship, so on November 4, it scraped together all the arrears and attached the late payment interest to San De Tang for collection, thinking that it could be safe and sound. Unexpectedly, San De Tang had already decided to obliterate the diplomatic history and take advantage of the danger to overturn the lease contract, and immediately commissioned Lawyer Bahe to file a lawsuit with the Concession Joint Court, requesting an emergency ruling to order the eviction based on Article 10 of the contract. The Bureau also entrusted Lawyer Dibake to defend, first requesting the rejection of the plaintiff's emergency application and ordering the submission to arbitration in accordance with Article 11 of the contract (copies No. 22 and No. 23). Unexpectedly, the French Concession Joint Court distorted the contract, saying that "re-occupation" was a representation of the termination of the contract, and recognized that the payment of rent was a provision for the performance of the contract, without the need for further arbitration, and ruled on January 7 of this year (copy No. 24). The Bureau lost the lawsuit for no reason and immediately declared its disapproval and requested a retrial (copy No. 25). The retrial ruling of the Concession Joint Court on May 23 of this year stated that the reasons for the original judgment were extremely correct and should be maintained (copy No. 26). Therefore, the leasing right, which was only obtained through the discussion of central and local diplomats over the past ten years and the Bureau's sacrifice of huge expenses and vested rights for the so-called cessation of disputes and promotion of amity in weak diplomacy, was completely lost through the first and second trials of the French Concession Joint Court, which still has a strong afterglow under the unequal treaty. After this retrial ruling, the lawyers of both parties repeatedly tried to mediate, but the San De Tang insisted on the claim to abolish the contract and insisted on quickly achieving its long-standing intention to obstruct the China Merchants Bureau Jin Li Yuan Wharf, and the mediation failed. Now, the lawyer Dibake, entrusted by the Bureau, declared that August 15 is the deadline for execution. If there is no final countermeasure before the execution, under the lingering remnants of this product of unequal treaties, not only will the leasing right that the Bureau barely possesses be gone, but the shipping rights that the country Guoguo still possesses will also be eroded from now on (attached picture). Looking back, the central and local diplomatic officials in the past ten years did not hesitate to bother, but now the French officials and people have successively taken advantage of the danger to seize it, and we are only facing the brunt with a shipping bureau alone, which is tantamount to fighting stones with eggs and there is no reason to win. The Bureau has repeatedly considered the final remedial measures, on the one hand, it intends to entrust the original lawyer again to submit new evidence to the French Concession Joint Court for retrial in accordance with Article 568 of the Civil Procedure Law and to investigate the provisions of Article 836 of the Civil Law implemented in May of this year, which stipulates that if the person with the right to use the land owes land rent up to the total amount of two years, the land owner may revoke its right to use the land unless there is another custom. In this case, the rent arrears have not reached the statutory limit, and the right to use the land should not be revoked according to law. Although the French Concession Joint Court has not recovered it, according to the principle of territoriality, the defendant is a Chinese and the land in dispute is in China, so it is natural not to reject the application of Chinese law, and Article 10 of the lease contract states that "If the lessee does not pay the rent quarterly in advance, the lessor may re-occupy the house after the lessor's notice is invalid, and may use other methods that the lessor deems appropriate to collect all the rent stipulated in this contract," which is clearly a provision to guarantee the rent. Therefore, the clause only says "re-occupy the house" and does not say "cancel the lease contract," and the purpose of its occupation is also to collect all the rent stipulated in this contract in accordance with this article until all the rent stipulated in this contract has been collected. After all the rent has been collected, the state before the occupation will naturally be restored, so the period of occupation will naturally end until all the rent has been obtained. Otherwise, the clauses in this article such as "occupy the house and collect all the rent stipulated in this contract" will be meaningless. However, the right to judicial relief does not belong to us, and it is still unknown whether we can win the victory. The exchange of this lease right was originally obtained through diplomatic means, and now the remedy should still be resorted to diplomacy. It is proposed that your ministry transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to quickly advise the French Consul on the previous situation of this case and the inappropriateness of the current judgment before the execution period from a friendly standpoint to stop the Public Concession court from execution and urge the French Consul to practice the French envoy and consul's repeated statement that there is no obstacle to the China Merchants Bureau Jin Li Yuan Wharf to restore the original lease contract and take care of international friendship. The time is urgent. The details and opinions are summarized and the relevant copies and maps of this case are attached for your review and prompt implementation. Respectfully presented to Minister of Communications Wang</p>
<p>The Water, Electricity and Engineering Strike of French Merchants Resolved:</p>
<p>Six Conditions Formally Signed:</p>
<p>All Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Afternoon:</p>
<p>The water, electricity and engineering strike of French merchants has been prolonged for two months without resolution. The situation of repeated mediation by the central government has been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is learned that the strike has had a satisfactory outcome on the day. All conditions have been signed and implemented. All workers and friends will resume work yesterday afternoon. The details are divided as follows: Negotiation Process:</p>
<p>Since Mr. Li Shizeng of the Central Committee took office as a mediator, he carefully investigated the reasons for the failure to resolve the strike. The problem was that the capitalists dismissed 40 workers, which the workers could not accept, and the workers could accept the conditions. Therefore, he repeatedly persuaded both parties. As a result, the 40 workers voluntarily withdrew from the company and took up positions in the trade union. As for the monthly salary, it was still taken by the capitalists. After consultation between the two parties, they were satisfied. Therefore, the day before yesterday afternoon, Mr. Li convened the municipal party headquarters, the municipal government, and labor and capital to negotiate and formally sign the agreement.</p>
<p>After the labor side accepted the mediator's opinion, it held a general meeting and selected Zhang Qixiang, Zheng Ruisheng, Xue Wansheng, Wang Jun, Zhang Renjun, Lu Guanhong, Shen Keming, and other seven representatives to go to Mr. Li's residence. The municipal government representative Geng Secretary Jizhi and the Consul General representative Du Yuesheng attended the negotiations. As a result, (1) strike wages were paid as usual, (2) each person was uniformly increased by 2 yuan and 4 jiao per month, (3) arrested workers were released, (4) the wages of 40 workers were paid as usual, and their treatment was the same as that of workers in the factory (Mr. Du Yuesheng was responsible for delivering them to the trade union every month), (5) the principles of pension, retirement money, and year-end bonus were accepted, and the methods were discussed separately, and (6) the company was not allowed to dismiss workers and staff without reason. The representatives signed the draft agreement one by one on the spot and handed it over to the municipal government representative. Then the municipal government representative went to the Consul General's Office to formally sign the agreement. The procedure was that the General Patrol Fei Wo Li signed the agreement on behalf of the Consul General, but Article 4 was changed to be responsible by the mediator Mr. Du Yuesheng and was not listed in the formal treaty, but it was stated in the draft agreement to release the workers.</p>
<p>Regarding the arrested workers, the workers demanded that they be released first and then resume work, while the capitalists would not release the arrested people until after the resumption of work. The two parties argued for a long time and failed to resolve the issue. Therefore, the representatives discussed and decided that Mr. Du Yuesheng would bail out the workers, and then the workers would resume work to avoid further misunderstandings between the two parties. Soon, Mr. Du bailed out all the workers at that time. Wage Issues:</p>
<p>Strike wages are a major issue for workers. Although the conditions were signed to be paid as usual, the workers needed to get them immediately to be satisfied, and the procedures were extremely difficult. The representatives reported to the mediator and agreed that after the trade union immediately compiled the list of strikers and submitted it to the capitalists, the strike wages would be issued to the workers in full. Trade Union Notice:</p>
<p>After the various conditions were negotiated, the trade union issued a notice saying: "For the notice, it is found that the strike conditions of the association have now been satisfactorily resolved by the Central Committee Member Li ordering the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to convene labor and capital mediation. The signed conditions are (1) strike wages are paid as usual, (1) each person is uniformly increased by 2 yuan and 4 jiao per month, (1) all arrested workers are released, (1) the wages of 40 workers are paid as usual, and their treatment is the same as that of workers in the factory (Mr. Du Yuesheng is responsible for sending them to the trade union every month), (1) the principles of pension, retirement money, and year-end bonus are accepted, and the methods are discussed separately, and (1) the company is not allowed to dismiss workers and staff without reason, totaling six items. Now it is specially scheduled to convene all workers to report at 9:00 am this morning (i.e. the 13th yesterday). If all workers think it is satisfactory, they will resume work at 1:00 pm. I am afraid that it is not well known, so I hereby notify you." Victory Meeting:</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Strike Committee held a strike victory and a welcome meeting for the released workers in the open space in front of the trade union, attended by more than 1,400 people, and dozens of armed police officers led by the patrol officer of the Second District Public Security Bureau maintained order. Zhang Amao was elected chairman to report the purpose of the meeting and to celebrate the victory of today's strike. Then Zhang Qixiang, Chen Guanhong, Li Zhongxing, Dai Hansen, Zheng Ruisheng, spoke in succession, generally saying that the workers were united and supported the trade union, and the final victory belonged to us. They shouted slogans until 2:00 pm and then dispersed to the company to resume work. All Resumed Work:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the meeting unanimously agreed that the conditions between labor and capital had been handled by the central government in this way, and the mediators had tried their best to mediate. It was also the time when the situation was unstable, and it was not appropriate to continue the strike. Therefore, they all unanimously agreed to abide by the central government's intention without objection. After discussion at the general meeting, all the workers went to the company to resume work. At 3:00 pm yesterday, the tram drove out and resumed traffic in the French Concession. This strike came to an end. Tail Sound of the Strike:</p>
<p>This time, the water, electricity, and engineering strike of French merchants has ended with the resumption of work by the workers, but the cause of the strike is not yet clear to all parties. Now, after the reporter of the Huadong News Agency investigated the workers' side, the truth is as follows: According to the workers, after the workers put forward the conditions, they were rejected by the capitalists three times, and they were already dissatisfied in their hearts. After being instigated by foreigners in the factory, they even ridiculed the workers for not having the courage to strike. Therefore, the workers were incited and instigated by the majority of foreigners, resulting in the fact of the strike. Later, after Mr. Du Yuesheng mediated twice, the workers immediately agreed to resume work. The factory even had measures such as closing the iron gate, which were said to have been advocated by foreigners, resulting in the prolongation of the strike and the failure to resolve it. Yesterday, when the workers went to resume work in the afternoon because the conditions had been resolved by the central government, there were still a large number of foreigners in charge of not opening the iron gate. Fortunately, the big boss insisted on opening it to avoid another change. Otherwise, would the strike not start again? Then, how will the workers act in the future will depend on the foreigners' performance in the factory. Otherwise, if the workers' minds are repeatedly incited by people, it is inevitable that they will go beyond the norm. Then, who will be responsible for it? The Ministry of Finance Convenes a Meeting:</p>
<p>Discuss National Tax Revenue:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance convened a national tax revenue group meeting in Shanghai, divided into five groups to discuss: (1) Customs Tariff Group, (2) Salt Affairs Group, (3) Stamp Duty Group, (4) Land Tax Group, (5) Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Group. All similar taxes are also included in each group. The chairmen are Zhang Fuyun, Zou Lin, Jia Shiyi, Qin Jingfu, Cheng Shudu, etc., respectively. Tax revenue agencies in various provinces have sent representatives to participate and intend to formulate a complete proposal for adoption. At present, except for the provinces of Yu, Jin, Ji, Cha, Sui, and Long, all have arrived one after another. Cai Song previously returned to Beijing and ordered all departments and sections to send all relevant documents to Shanghai for reference. The day before yesterday, he went to Shanghai to prepare everything. Workers of the Two Railways Requested Rent and Rice Subsidies:</p>
<p>Director Liu reported the difficulties to the representatives and submitted a request to the ministry for instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Recently, workers of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways requested the railway bureau to provide rent and increase rice subsidies for those with monthly salaries below 50 yuan. The reason is that employees with salaries above 50 yuan and below 100 yuan have a rent subsidy of 5 yuan, while those with salaries below 50 yuan have a more difficult life and should be given the same subsidy. As for the rice subsidy, the recent price of rice has been high, and various agencies in Shanghai have considerable subsidies, while the two railways only temporarily give workers below 30 yuan a rice subsidy of 1 yuan per month, so they also requested a slight increase. However, the railway bureau's opinion is that the matter of requesting rent has been handled separately by the former Director Cai during his tenure last year. At that time, all employees requested a salary increase. Director Cai submitted a report to the ministry for approval. Those with monthly salaries below 20 yuan were given an increase of 20%, and those with monthly salaries above 20 yuan and below 50 yuan were given an increase of 10%. Later, employees with salaries above 50 yuan requested a precedent, and it was approved to add 5 yuan of rent per month. This measure has given special subsidies to workers with more difficult lives. The amount of 20% or 10% is already particularly generous compared to those who only get 5 yuan of rent for 50 yuan. As for the rice subsidy, the railway bureau immediately reported the situation to the ministry when the workers requested it last month, but the ministry stated that there were no rice subsidy measures for all railways. Later, Director Liu repeatedly pleaded and finally obtained the ministry's approval to temporarily give 1 yuan of rice subsidy per month to those below 30 yuan. It has not been long since then, and they are requesting another increase. Although the railway bureau sympathizes with improving the lives of workers, the railway is a business organization. If it only knows how to increase expenses without considering the amount of income, the result will inevitably be losses, leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, it is impossible not to consider carefully in fact. The sharp rise in gold prices this year has had a huge impact on the railway bureau. The loss in gold prices alone for the interest payable to the Sino-British Company this year is no less than one million yuan, and the loss in principal is also more than 900,000 yuan. These two items alone have resulted in an additional loss of about two million yuan this year. As for other materials such as wooden sleepers and steel rails, which are all purchased from foreign countries, the loss in gold prices is also very large. The budget of the two railways, such as the net profit obtained from business last year, is also not much. After the military started this year, the goods on the Jinpu and Longhai Railways were completely stopped, and the business of the two railways suffered a major blow. Last year, the income of the two railways reached more than 35,000 yuan per day. Currently, the income is only about 25,000 yuan. The loss in gold prices is so great, and the decline in business is also so great. Therefore, according to the calculations this year, the two railways have fallen into a state of bankruptcy. It is fortunate to be able to maintain wages. Currently, the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan Railways not only do not have rice subsidies and ordinary room and board, but also owe many monthly salaries that employees should receive. The employees of the two railways have other benefits besides receiving salaries on a monthly basis, such as savings, which are slightly better in comparison. The railway bureau originally did not want to give up the interests of employees where it could be accommodated in fact, but now the income and expenditure are difficult, and the image of bankruptcy has appeared. It is already struggling to support it. If it continues to add rice subsidies, rent, and other huge expenditures, the burden will be even more unbearable. Director Liu reported the difficulties in detail to the employee representatives, and agreed to discuss it again after the military is pacified, national traffic is restored, gold prices are lower, and income is slightly better. The representatives also understood very well and agreed to report the difficulties to the workers. At the same time, Director Liu also submitted a request to the ministry for instructions on how to handle the matter. Shanghai County's Budget for Local Revenue and Expenditure in the 19th Year:</p>

<p>The Japanese Marines stationed in Shanghai, together with the entire marine soldiers of the Japanese warships Hinoki and Sagano, held a general mobilization combat exercise in Shanghai for two days starting from the previous day. The participants included small teams, large teams, field artillery teams, armored vehicle teams, machine gun teams, affiliated teams, and other soldiers, totaling one thousand several hundred people. The general commander was Shibayama. Starting from the previous night, military operations began in the eastern area of the Public Concession. The soldiers of the two warships were the attacking team. They landed from Wusong and marched in formation along Jungong Road to attack the main areas of Yangshupu. The soldiers stationed in Shanghai defended the eastern area of the Concession and practiced war for three hours. They continued for another three hours yesterday morning, and then dispersed and returned to the camp. The actions during the exercise were realistic, like the start of a war. The nearby residents were quite surprised. The Hunan-Hubei Railway Opens to Traffic Shanghai News:</p>
<p>The China Travel Service has confirmed that the Hunan-Hubei section of the Guangdong-Han Railway was fully opened to traffic on the 8th of this month. The train schedule is as follows: The first passenger train departs from Xujiahui to Changsha at 7:30 pm. The second passenger train departs from Changsha to Xujiahui at 7:40 am.

The fifth express train departs from Xujiahui to Changsha at 6:30 pm. The sixth express train departs from Changsha to Xujiahui at 2:00 pm. Zhenru Radio Station Completion Date:</p>
<p>Completion of Electrification in November:</p>
<p>Since the start of construction, the Zhenru International Radio Station has been working very actively. According to news from the Ministry of Communications, this project is expected to be completed by the end of October this year and can be electrified in November. The scheduled time for communication from Shanghai to San Francisco will take a maximum of 30 minutes. The San Francisco side has also been making every effort to plan and build a radio station by the US government. In three months, Chinese and American people will be able to communicate with each other in a very short time. Shanghai and Fengxian Counties Jointly Prepare for Defense:</p>
<p>Fengxian County Magistrate Shen Qingchen recently stated that the county borders Shanghai County and has many intertwined rivers and streams. At this time of urgent military affairs at the front, defense in the rear is especially important. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Shanghai County Government to initiate the formulation of joint defense measures. Once agreement is obtained, it will be implemented immediately. It is reported that Fengxian County has requested the Wudan and Wucheng joint defense plan from Wujin County in order to proceed. Dredging Yutang Preparatory Meeting:</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Dredging Yutang Preparatory Committee held its seventh preparatory meeting at the Beiqiao Third District Office at 2:00 pm yesterday. The attendees were Director Wu of the Construction Bureau, the district magistrates of the second, third, and sixth districts, and Jiang Zhujun, Peng Yinzhao, Sun Shiben, Ni Binzhi, and others. After performing the ceremony, Chairman Yang Fulin (district magistrate of the third district) reported everything. Then the following were discussed and resolved: (1) It was stated in the Feng County Government Order No. 290 that the land taxation exceeding the limit should be handled separately by the local people. It was discussed and decided that the dredging expenses are one of the profit-generating undertakings, which is different from the nature of ordinary land donations. Moreover, the burden only falls on the farmers related to water conservancy on both sides of Yutang, and it is not a uniform burden on all the people in the county. Moreover, the expenses are a temporary collection, which seems to be very different from the nature of taxation exceeding the limit. The association should formulate a budget and continue to request approval for transfer. (2) How should the taxation method be stipulated? It was discussed and decided that the taxation should be carried out in two phases. The first phase will be the winter Cao in the 19th year, and the second phase will be the silver Cao in the 20th year. One dime per mu for winter Cao and five cents per mu for silver Cao. Yangtze River China Merchants Bureau Ship Resumes Schedule to Maintain Commerce Accusations Against Foreign Ships for Extortion:</p>
<p>During the recent arrival of the Communists in Xiang, the people of Changsha rushed to Wuhan to escape. The British Taikoo Company's Suiding ship happened to be traveling from Xiang to Hubei. Many disaster victims in Changsha sought to board this ship to Han, and the ship's comprador, Mr. Yang, took the opportunity to extort huge sums of money from passengers. The first-class cabin required 200 yuan per person, the official cabin required 140 yuan per person, and the third-class cabin sold for 70 yuan per person. He refused to carry passengers without a single penny. Although the disaster victims pleaded in every possible way, Mr. Yang and others ignored them. The waterway journey from Xiang to Han was only 14 hours. Mr. Yang earned more than 30,000 yuan in this one trip. The disaster victims were penniless after arriving in Han. They reported the matter to the Changsha Travelers Association in Han, requesting assistance in redress. Upon receiving the report, the Travelers Association stated that Mr. Yang had taken advantage of the power of foreign merchants to take advantage of people's dangers and extorted huge sums of money. His intentions were extremely vicious. The Travelers Association, in the name of the representatives of the victims, filed a lawsuit with the Wuhan court, requesting that the inhumane Mr. Yang be detained and punished. The court has accepted the case and approved the summons for Mr. Yang to appear in court for questioning. Chinese Merchant Ships Released:</p>
<p>The six Hai ships that went to Qingdao have returned to Beijing. The Chinese merchant ships that were suspended have been released one after another at the request of various companies and proof that foreign merchant ships have taken the opportunity to compete for transportation, causing unexpected losses to Chinese merchants. Therefore, Qiu Wei and others of the Transportation Department have replied to Shanghai that a batch of rented river ships will be released first. Starting from today, eight ships can resume business. Among these resuming ships, the China Merchants Bureau accounts for six ships, and the Sanbei and Zhaoxing each have one ship. Please Send Military Police to Escort:</p>
<p>Among the Yangtze River Chinese ships, there are military police escorting the ships. Recently, due to the tense military situation, the Capital Garrison Headquarters withdrew the military police from each ship and reassigned them to other tasks. Recently, the China Merchants Bureau and others have reported that the river ships can resume service, but there are often hooligans causing trouble along the way, which not only affects passengers but also hinders business. They specifically telegraphed the Garrison Department to restore the military police stationed on the ships to ensure the safety of travelers. Yesterday, Gu Zhenglun replied to Shanghai, roughly saying that the military police currently have other tasks and it is difficult to send ships temporarily. The China Merchants Bureau sent another telegram to Beijing yesterday afternoon, requesting Commander Gu to send 24 military police first and distribute them to six ships including Jiangshun, Jiang'an, Jianghua, Jiangxin, Jiangjing, and Jianguo, reducing the number of military police stationed on each ship by four, which</p>
<h3>Arrest of Extortionist in Jie County</h3>
<p>Ye Zhongting, a resident of Qingyang in the Eleventh District, opened the Yonghe Industrial Company in Shanghai, producing "Chang'e" brand cosmetics on a large scale. At the end of last month, the company received three threatening letters in succession. The day before yesterday, Shen Zihe's house in Dongcun Village also received a threatening letter. After investigation by the local defense corps, it was discovered that Jin Youjin, who watches the Doutian Temple in Dong Street, was responsible. On the 11th, the Public Security Bureau, together with Deputy Corps Commander Bian Gao of the district, apprehended Jin and yesterday (the 12th) escorted him to Jie County for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Appeal Against Insult Conviction</h3>
<p>Yin Xifan, a native of Shazhou, was convicted of public insult by the county court. Yin refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Wuxian District Court. The court has scheduled a hearing for 10:00 AM on the 16th, summoning Meng Yaping and Ding Yi, members of the County Party Rectification Committee, and Zhou Zhonghui of the Second District Party Committee to appear in court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Merchant Corps in Yuanjia Village Captures Bandits</h3>
<p>Based on reports that bandits were hiding and holding meetings in Yuanjia Village, south of the county seat, the county government secretly ordered Wang Guanqin, the head of the merchant corps, to assemble the first, second, third, and fourth detachments of the merchant corps on the 11th. They gathered at the Zheng clan ancestral hall and secretly searched Yuanjia Village at night, capturing seven individuals: Lin Chuan (a messenger), Wu Ruzhou, Xu Achu (former secretary of the Farmers' Association), Wu Baoquan, Wu Laoda, Wu Gao's wife, and Wu Jiang's wife. Two bombs were found in Wu Ruzhou's home, and his brother Yitao escaped. A set of old military uniforms was found in Wu Baoquan's home. All were escorted to the corps headquarters and on the 12th, sent to Jie County for interrogation. Wu Ruzhou and others confessed to participating in robberies, including the robbery of Xu Shoulian's house, from which they received two silver dollars. After interrogation, they were detained.</p>
<h3>Results of the Meeting at the Xishi Township Office</h3>
<p>The atrocities committed by bandits in Taohuashi Village, Makouli, and other places in Xishi Township, including murder and robbery, have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Xishi Township Office held a meeting attended by more than ten people from the ten villages of Xishi, including Chen Mengxing. They also went to the county to petition County Magistrate Li, requesting: (1) that a police detachment be stationed in Huangtu Town to maintain order; (2) that the Fifth District Corps Headquarters recruit 40 to 60 temporary militia members, and the Sixth District recruit 60 to 80 temporary militia members; (3) that the existing defense corps in Xishi be reorganized; (4) that talented individuals with experience in bandit suppression be appointed as corps commanders; (5) that firearms be collected locally by the corps commanders; (6) that expenses be jointly borne by the gentry and wealthy, with contributions from merchants and subsidies from the local government; (7) that Li Xiumin and Zhu Tifu, the heads of the Fifth and Sixth Sub-bureaus, and Zhou Jun, the leader of the police detachment, who retreated during the fighting and arrested innocent civilians, be removed from their posts and thoroughly investigated. County Magistrate Li accepted each request, and the representatives then withdrew.</p>
