<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界注目之印度</h3>
<p>記者前論印度非武力抵抗說不易貫澈者。蓋有見夫世界凡事之爭初皆不欲以武力抵抗。而卒不免於武力之多也。甘地前曾發表一文。謂暴舉爲非武力抵抗之唯一危機。故力戒暴舉以示必欲貫澈非武力抵抗之决心。然其。準備開始實行之哀的美敦書甫。於昨日發出而爲第二領袖之丕特爾氏即。已宣言世界歷史所未前有之戰爭將。於數日内發作並勸怕死者與富有者出境是。其準備以非武力開始抵抗之日即。已準備以絕大武力繼起抵抗之時甘地鑒於前度流血。慘劇之有違仁愛本心故。創此非武力抵抗然其結果仍有非用武力不可之勢則。此後印度恐。將益陷於風雲不測之境矣夫。今日之印度世界各國所注目者也此。次金價暴漲之風潮初。起時謂因印度改用金本位所致近。之續漲又。謂爲與印席徵抽銀稅有關係而今日路透社之大阪電又。謂印度擬增加棉布進口稅日本紗廠棉商已聯合共同表示反抗此事現已引起甚大之注意。印度有此提議後。證券已爲低落云云是。今日世界之金融商業在在與印度有關倘若其國内因運動獨立而更引起戰爭之紛亂。則其影響亦豈僅及其國内之人民而已。故吾謂今日之印度誠可加以注意者也</p>

<p>（各位同志最近幾星期以來、政治方面、自從閻錫山於二十三日聯名一班武人發出漾電、實行反對黨的事情出來以後、差不多全國的黨員和民衆、統統注目這件事情、現在不僅是使得民心動摇、甚至我們迅速將統一的黨國基礎也有動摇的趨勢、這件事情、是非常之嚴重的、直到如</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>今、還没有得到相當的解决、所以前日中央執行委員第三次全體會議開會第一天、首先就决議派李委員石曾先生張委員溥泉先生、和監察院院長趙戴文先生三位、去調查這件事情、這個意思、就是表明本黨實在是眞正的希求中國的和平統一、不願意再有戰事、並且希望唱這種謬誤議論的人、要他趕緊覺悟、自動地去保持他革命的光榮、從閻錫山領銜的漾電出來之後、到今天爲止、差不多電中列名的人通電聲明係冒名竊名的、已經有十幾個人了、除了一部分已經叛逆的將領的列名、没有聲明之外、其餘的差不多統統都有聲明了、此外比如孫殿英的土匪的軍隊、以及有幾個福建方面列名的人、就是連名字也不曉得的土匪頭腦、他們曾經入黨没有、領銜的人、也統統不曾過問、這些黨國敵人的土匪首領、也來講國家和黨的事情、眞是一件大大笑話的事、從這些地方看起來、閻百川先生領銜發出漾電的事情、究竟是什麽一回事、眞要令人莫明其妙、爲什麽没有入黨的人、他作的且是土匪的勾當、也可出來過問黨事呢、不要說吳稚暉先生有幾千字的文章責問他、我只一句話問他、你聯名通電的將領、有幾個人加入了黨、單以這一句話問他就夠了、就可以明白他們是不是眞正爲黨爲國、抑還是想召集一班土匪起來搗亂、使得黨國不能安寗與統一、事實上的確是這樣的、所以二十三日的漾電剛發出來、不久不僅是聯名通電的人多出來否認、而且責難他、即連他號召的所謂河南的韓復渠石友三等、也來了電報、謂一切的事情、即令是國家有了大難不能解决、也得要由黨部來處置一切、這樣一來、就把漾電完全取消了、閻錫山所講的話、完全屬於廢話、這更可證明、雖然本黨有很多很大的危險、但是黨不經過這許多的危險、是不能成功革命的、我相信經過這一個危險以後、大家對於黨部理論、黨的地位、將可更加明白、而本黨的基礎、在這時候、也就更加鞏固、我們並且還可相信黨的力量、目前已經統一了全國、本黨的主義、也可以一步一步的從此實現、在不久的將來、閻百川等在河南山東的軍隊、也許不用武力、他們自然而然就要退却下去的、從這點看起來、本黨的力量、當不是從前幾年可以比擬、現在就是不用武力、也可以統一全國的、今後更没有那一個軍閥、再敢出來反對本黨、或倡有謬誤的議論如像閻百川一樣、並且我們還很希望閻百川由於這一回的舉動、能夠赶緊覺悟、眞眞實實的來做我們本黨的一個同志、不要受反動派的　使、而做反革命的工具、再則昨天接到遼寗張司令長官漢卿一個電報、他的電報、是主强和平的、他表示自已很願意國家没有事情、能夠和平統一、同時兄弟即用個人名義、復他一個電　電報中間有幾點、在今天可以報告一下（電文另錄報告電文後繼續報告）我相信張漢卿一定能夠仗義執言、能夠共矢和平、因之更可相信黨國的基礎、已經穏固、以後再没有軍閥敢來反對黨、但是還有一個危險、就是這一回的事情、一面是政治上軍事上的行動、另一方面因爲閻百川受了反動派包圍、他起頭想拿國民會議來壓制黨、使得黨不能夠講話、一切的决議、通要取消、但是後來他覺得不能這樣做、又想了另一個方法、什麽要黨員總投票、來表决黨事、這是什麽一回事呢、就是想要挾本黨、毁壞本黨、使得本黨分崩離散、亦即是不要黨、俾得隨便作他們反革命的勾當、這完全是一種陰謀夢想、要拿我們的黨員來破壞黨、對於這一點、同志們要十分的認識明白、這十分嚴重關係於黨國的存亡、也就是目前本黨很大的一個危險、希望各同志大家盡心竭力、共同去打破這個危險、實現本黨的主義、實行本黨的决議案、使得本黨的基礎、眞正鞏固起來、必須這樣、然後我們纔配做黨員、纔可以完成革命的目的、這就是兄弟今天的一點貢獻完了、）蔣氏報告畢、即宣告禮成散會、</p>

<h3>張羣昨日送返滬</h3>
<p>閩事已籌有妥善辦法</p>
<p>省委解京負責者處分</p>
<p>上海特别市市長張羣、上月二十八日晚、由閩乘普安軍艦返滬、途中遇霧、直至昨午十二時、方抵吳淞口、此次同來者有隨員林炎南等數人、至同去之秘書郭詩輝、聞因事須一星期後方可返滬云、本埠軍政界、在碼頭迎迓者、有市政府職員及海軍編遣辦事處副官多人、張氏登岸後、即乘車逕返寓休息、下午三時半、至市政府辦公、本報記者特往訪晤、張氏談閩事甚詳、茲分述于次、</p>
<p>查辦結果張氏云、余此次奉命赴閩、查辦拘捕省委糾紛、即抱定維持中央威信、解决地方糾紛爲宗旨、與楊主席抵閩後、即派員赴尤溪、向盧興邦詳詢一切、並至各方詳加調查、始知癓結所在、完全由於猜忌誤會、外傳某方反抗中央、均非事實、遂留閩與楊主席等熟商、最後始議决一極妥善辦法、解除地方糾紛、而一方又能維持中央威信、故于離閩時、將查辦結果、及善後方法、電呈中央鑒核施行、</p>
<p>省委解京　呈中央電文意、略謂經調查結果、據林忠·薩福疇·等稱、林知淵等六人、確有反動嫌疑、故不得已加以逮捕、但林忠薩福疇盧興榮等擅行拘捕、有違法規、應加處分、至被拘捕之省委林知淵、許顯時、陳乃元、程時煃、鄭寳菁、及水上公安局局長吳澍等六人、應速令解省、交與陳季良司令、轉行動京、由中央嚴密究辦、有無反動嫌疑再爲處置、</p>
<p>自請處分張氏又謂、此係余等之主張、中央究能同意與否、尙不可知、至省防軍司公林忠、要塞司令薩福疇、及省委盧興榮等、均已深知擅行拘捕之非是、紛紛自請處分、今日（三日）余並接閩電、林知淵等省委、即可解省轉京、故所定辦法必可順利進行、毫無問題、余在舟中接林忠等來電、謂外間謠諑繁興、忠等竭誠擁護中央、决無二志、請代向中央解釋云云、故外傳盧興邦窥浙等語、絕不可信、楊主席暂時恐不來京、至閩省府之改組爲事實問題也、</p>
<p>暗殺事件　余此次奉命赴閩查辦、旣無權利之可言、對于閩中個人亦無恩怨、抵閩後不幸即發生暗殺事件、故可斷定爲一種政治作用、黎中行副官以是殞命、黎隨余近五載、頗能勇于任事、此次忽被慘殺、殊足惋惜、黎在汽車中、身已中彈、猶能躍出車外、射擊兇徒、行十餘步始倒地、被擊傷之兇徒、彈人左腦、神志已昏、言語糢糊不能辨、故無任何口供、外傳某某主使云云、均係揣測之辭、非爲兇手所親供、黎之靈柩、不日即由其老父運返安徽原籍、至留閩接洽之郭詩輝秘書、日内亦可返滬、余因三中全會怱促無新提案、俟市府公事淸理後、再行晉京、</p>
<p>郭燊來電市政府昨接得隨同張市長赴閩秘書郭詩輝來電云、抵閩後、奉派赴尤溪、並調查各方情形、事竣回省、市長本維持中央威信、解决地方糾紛之旨、擬具辦法、呈請中央核辦、被拘省委數日内即可送省、市長已啓程回滬、燊留此尙須一星期、並聞、郭燊叩、</p>

<h3>各機關紀念週彙誌</h3>
<p>市黨部　上海特别市黨部、昨日上午九時、舉行擴大總理紀念週、到全市代表大會代表各機關代表·曁市黨部職員三百餘人、潘公展主席許也夫司儀、黃香谷鮑容紀錄、行禮如儀畢、即由陳德徽作政治報告、其詞云、各位同志、上星期、市黨部接奉中央電令、叫我們舉行擴大紀念週、來報告中央最近的態度、和閻錫山的錯誤、恰巧機會遇得很好、全市代表大會、剛於前天開幕、我們眞好來舉行、現在且將閻錫山的錯誤來申說一下、閻錫山自從發出蒸電以後、各方面多有很透澈的斥責、我們曉得、閻錫山表面上的錯誤、就在他的蒸電上所說的、什麽戡止内亂·禮讓爲國·在野負責、這幾句話、他表明自已要下野、同時並勸蔣介石同志下野、關於禮讓一點、駁斥他的很多、他實在不明禮讓、我們可以分開三端來說（一）只有個人的權利·法益·才可以談禮讓、而表示遜謙坦白、但是爲大衆謀福利的責任、根本不能談禮讓、換句話說、革命的事業、革命的責任、不能談禮讓、爲國民的事業和責任、豈容禮讓、且看諸葛孔明、他爲要維持漢家正統、明知劉阿斗捧抱不起、但是他爲了責任的關係、鞠躬盡瘁、死而後已、再看三代時禮讓之風甚盛、可是多在太平時候、根據過去的歷史、考</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>察現在的情形、决不允許任何負責任的人來談什麽禮讓不禮讓、以前總理就臨時大總統職的時候、爲要求全國的統一及和平、所以統統將權力讓與袁世凱、不料後來袁世凱謀創旁制、搆成内戰、輾轉相循、直成了十四年混亂之局、總理心頭、甚是不安、現在如果將全黨同志和革命的民衆的頭顱血花換來的締造的黨國的基礎、給任何人來談禮讓、成何事體、負黨國重大責任的、是絕對談不到禮讓的、閻錫山他不懂革命、纔有此荒謬絕倫的言論、（二）他的目的、實在希望人家實行禮讓、因爲有許多千奇百怪的無聊的政客、在包圍他、煽惑他、他以爲只要蔣介石同志下野、他便會受人家的擁戴、所以纔有此荒謬絕倫的思想、（三）他說可以在野負責、這句話事實上說不過去、簡直務盾極了、下了野怎能負責、如果下野可以負責、便能彀挑起内戰、而在朝的有負什麽責呢、閻錫山委實不懂政治常識和革命的情緒、纔有此荒謬絕倫的言論、他如果當眞想談禮讓、儘可以自已去談、下野就下野好了、如果出洋少伴侶、馮玉祥至今還候着他、他自從蒸電發出到現在、他不惟不實踐他所說的禮讓、</p>
<p>他還在山西做土皇帝的迷夢、又主張組織什麽樞密院元老院、還有召集各届中央委員會議、黨員總投票、他這種說法、自然是有爲而發的、他如果要出洋、我相信全國民衆、必定都會得歡送他出去的、我們再說他茺謬的主張吧、他主張召集各届中央委員聯合會議、並令全國黨員總投票、所謂黨事付之黨人、他說三中全會不合法爲什麽又要召集三届中委、分明他自已曉得一二届他並不是中央委員、如果集會、他没有插足地的、市執委會已有斥電發出、我們曉得、黨人没有個人的自由、只有黨的自由、他這樣的言行、眞是叛黨、謀傾覆國民黨、我們自當以黨的紀律去嚴厲的制裁他、他說中央一二兩届中央、不少忠實同志、無端被開除、這樣說來、總理之對付陳炯明·開除楊希閔·劉振寰·都有不對了、</p>
<p>他何以有這樣　　下黨的言行、他是個梟雄、他自民元起便做了出西圭皇帝、洪憲時代他可以稱臣、各個軍閥登臺、他的地位都不動搖、他想保存他的地盤、在此時機、又想施行狡猾的手叛亂、他都在暗中指使、我們是明白曉得的、這次他又想抄老文章、而膽大妄爲起來、他對黨不獨不認識、而且輕視得很、他以爲本黨是個普通的黨、革命領袖有類軍閥、不曉得本黨是有主義的、革命的領袖、是始終不渝的、領袖們都確遵着總理的遺敎、拿生命和能力來貢獻給黨的、我們也曉得、他現在被一切的反革命份子所包圍、造成了如是的錯誤、而想將本黨搗亂得四分五裂、總結一句、他做慣土皇帝、他簡直不曉得門外的事體、終究是土頭土腦的、現在正是革命和反革命封建勢力鬭爭的時機、越是將它消滅得快、黨和民衆的福利、也便實現得快、至於中央對閻錫山的態度、是非常嚴正的、明知他没有受過相當的敎育、陶冶和修養、根本不懂得革命的意義、所以想依據總理對陳炯明的方法來對付他、一再勸告、不忍他自絕於黨、如果到了萬不得已的時候、自然、將以黨紀相繩、三中全會會議時、已决議派員調查、足證中央還想玉成他、而以寛大的態度對付他、如果他再不覺悟、自有嚴正的對付方法、來爲民衆剷除這種叛徒、完了</p>

<p>資本制度競爭狀况之下、不免互相仇視、互傷感情、并且許多人、因此失敗、甚至傾家蕩産、但是我們怎樣可以免除這些弊端呢、現在有三個答覆、資本主義、說吾們已經有了這種資本制度、可以不必改變、共産主義者、主張用强暴的手段、奪人家的財産、社會主義者、主張用和平的方法、改良社會的經濟現狀、但是用什麽方法呢、吾們現在應該注意（一）便工人組織鞏固的團體、代表自已的利益、（二）使工人組織勞動政黨像英國的工黨一樣、（三）用徴稅的方法、减少資産的危險、徴稅的方法有三種、就是孫總理在民生主義中、也曾經講過、（甲）所得稅、（乙）遺産稅、（丙）地産稅、（四）由國家現定最低限度的工資、（五）實行社會保險、（甲）疾病保險、（乙）意外保險、</p>
<p>（丙）産婦保險、（丁）老年保險、（戊）失業保險、（六）一切社會上的主要生産實業、都應該劃歸國家管理、總之、中國人民、目前對于西方的資本主義、應該注意兩種危險、（甲）胡亂地採取資本主義、不加思索、（乙）不能獲得歐美資本制度的利益、反而受到許多害處、鄙人曾讀中山先生的民生主義、非常欽佩、認爲很有價值、因爲民生問題解决了、甚麽社會問題、都可以迎刄而解、總之、我們要研究怎樣可以取其優點、去其劣點云云、今日下午五時、繼續演講、題爲帝國主義</p>

<p>先生寓錫之西溪。風景淸幽。有園竹叢大蔬圃池澤之屬。上有禽翔於百仭。下有鱗泳於千尋。先生游散其間。縱意容冶。超然塵世。亦足自快矣。觀夫先生年逾花甲。而體態巍然。精神矍鑠。蓋游於物外之故也。</p>
<p>先生記憶過人。博覽陳編。窮讀古籍。輒能背誦。有經笥之腹。而性好畫眠。午後二句鐘。爲先生畫眠時間。習以爲常。無或間斷。晚成曾任職該院。得親左右。故知之審也。</p>
<p>昔春秋魯人宰予。字子我。亦稱宰我。孔子弟子。好畫寢。（見論语）又東漢浚儀（即今河南開封縣西北）邊韶字孝先。以文學名。才思敏捷。應口成章。有腹笥之號。亦好畫眠。（見後漢書）然則唐先生者。可謂遠代之宰予。近代之邊孝先矣。</p>
<h3>駢指泥印</h3>

<p>邑中有顧老兒者。操胠篋術。術殊神妙。故從未破獲。顧老兒之雙手。均有特别標記。蓋大拇指旁。多一小指。俗稱六指頭者是也。本月十七號。鎭東吳姓家。忽告失竊。檢視失物。都價値平常。爲銅掇菜刀之屬。而於廚房墻上。發見一雙泥印。赫然十二指。明晰可數。知爲顧老兒所爲。乃報告公安局。請求緝獲。局警往顧老兒家。顧尙高枕而臥。遂曳之起。蜂擁至局。鞫訊時。顧老兒矢不承認。言不彈此調。倐已數載。且决無自留手印。而啓人疑竇之理。足見係他人所爲。作此陷我者。局長詢無端倪。乃暫押拘留所中。顧老兒有一女。年已二九。字同邑呂某。定今年年底出閣。老兒被押後。呂某大抱不平。四出奔走。委人說項。並至失主吳某處。爲其泰山緩頰。老兒之女。亦携銅掇菜刀等物。原璧還吳。言係得諸其父房中。吳某爲此一對未婚夫婦所哀求。不覺憐之。遂自請撤銷。將老兒釋出。老兒出所後。對呂某心感異常。而對誣陷之竊賊。大爲憤恨。前日。（二十六）老兒允呂某要求。將女提早嫁呂。翌日。其女始明告老兒。云吳某失竊。乃其婿呂某所爲。蓋呂某與老兒女訂婚後。往來甚密。急欲結婚。見老兒生性固執。堅欲遲至年底。無法可施乃密商諸老兒女。作此勾當。假奔走營救之慇懃。希婚期之提早云。老兒聞語。不覺跌足大恚。然生米煑成熟飯。已不可及。乃申斥婿女數言了事</p>

<p>晚近菊部人材。以生旦兩行爲最盛。蓋取其能投時好而易致大名故也。凈角中之壽臣少山喜瑞輩。互雄南北。大有獨支巨厦抗衡生旦之趨勢。而丑角中之長林長華富祿富蕙輩。亦能急起直追。不甘退後。其吸引觀者之魔力。恐不在郝金之下。惜乎長林衰病。無復當年煥發之精神。富蕙又嫌稍嫩。今而後將讓長華富禄師徒稱雄矣。蕭馬之雅聲。已次第蓄之於唱片中。尤以馬之雄嗓善歌。爲最受人歡迎。前日愚自得勝公司購得其新由大中華灌收之斷臂稅書掃地掛畫小放牛諸片。頗愜於懐。按斷臂之老旦。以羅福山爲最穏練。富祿夙亦工此。四句二簧原板。韻味醇厚。直超李多奎臥雲居士而上之。一段說白。口吻之逼眞。俱非時下能唱而不善做之老旦所可比擬。掃地掛畫之唱腔。宗法凈角。居然實大聲宏。尤以（叩罷頭來謝恩洪）之腔爲最佳。小放牛一片。則又回復其丑角本行。佐以富連成班卒業之于蓮仙。相得乃益彰矣。總之富祿天賦佳喉。益以憁慧之資質。故能有此才藝。後來丑角。當推之爲巨擘焉。</p>
<h3>紀葫蘆字藝</h3>
<p>— 豁</p>
<p>畏畏友嚴芙孫氏。文章藝事。久負盛譽。而葫蘆字藝。尤其心血所灌注。葫蘆問津處。自遷設天蟾舞台西首新館後。載譽尤盛。昨晤舍戚胡君。述及嚴氏字藝。頗有數事。神妙足傳。爰紀其略。藉覘一斑。</p>
<p>余友周無碍君。玩票有年。旬前將赴首都新春游藝堂會。瀕行。忽櫻小極。深恐誤塲。當在嚴氏悶葫蘆中。摇占（戔勺）兩字。嚴斷曰。戔旁無水。此行必致擱淺。而勺字缺金。釣不能成矣。周聞斷。不禁大詫曰。予所演習者。正爲釣金龜一劇。不圖胡盧雙珠。竟有先見也。</p>
<p>南市兪柏記。將承包首都某項建築工程。力盼其成。忽生窒碍。急往叩機。摇出（其區）兩珠。嚴立斷曰。（其）爲無土之基。根本基礎。未見鞏固。（區）字之形。又屬金甌殘破。右邊所缺者。厥惟片瓦。片瓦無存。終成解矣。俞細按字理。知已絕望。未幾開標。果然落選。</p>
<p>友甲與友乙。居情敵地位。更以誤會。而愈决裂。甲往問機。搖（吳兼）二字嚴曰。試推（吳）字。是無女爲君可娱也。再斷（兼）字。不如一言成謙。毅然謙讓。否則（言）加（吳）成誤。（女）加（兼）成嫌。有女從中積嫌謀慝。則誤會益甚。愈難收拾矣。甲聞斷憬悟。竟割愛與乙友好如初。　　豐勝行職員胡某。崴首博負。挪虧公欵。行主將控訴押追。胡家屬恐。往詢葫蘆。搖（宛兌）二字。嚴曰。（宛）爲飯碗已破之象。雖已挽人婉懇。但以（兌）字相推。說旁無言。恐終無言可說也。結果。胡果去職。</p>
<p>友人王君。與乃叔略有私債。顧爲數不多。且屬尊長。不便屢索。偶然詢及。輙被呵責。日前。搖占（歐訴）兩字。嚴笑曰。不必多索。徒費唇舌。蓋（歐）字已明言是爲區區之欠。而（訴）字分明爲開言一討。便遭申斥。字理顯豁呈露。不待推敲而後知機也。王大嘆服。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>乘電車在擁擠的時候。須將左手攀住籐圈。右手揷在袋中。那麽扒手雖刁。亦奈何你不得。</p>
<p>租房子先要看明門口有没有銅牌。和客堂裏陳設得怎樣。倘使没有銅牌。客堂裏雜亂無序。這種二房東是靠不住的。</p>
<p>這幾天腦膜炎症又猖獗起來了。這種病症。最容易傳染。尤其是在公衆塲所。愼防之法。可將手帕上灑些香水。走在路上。把手帕遮了口鼻。可以免去危險。其餘各浴堂旅社菜館茶樓酒肆劇塲等處。以少去爲是。</p>
<p>吸得烟切勿用紅頭火柴。因爲紅頭火柴的燐毒。比黑頭要多上幾倍。吸了是很危險的。</p>

<p>之堅毅。誠爲難能可貴。良足欽佩。而美國方面有如此盛大之歡迎。鄙人躬與其盛。同深愉快。亦應同致感謝者也。次由華盛頓大學敎授康維氏（康君係華盛頓大學歷史敎授兼中國劇學敎授）演說中國戲劇之歷史及其優點。淵源不苟。殊爲難能。結語謂吾儕習聞梅君來美。已有多年。今日卒見光臨。幸得就承指敎。此誠研究東方藝術戲劇者之絕佳機會。眞不勝愉快之至。梅君不特善演華劇。且能改進中國古代之戲劇。使人重現於舞臺。復多精妙超雅之創作。遂致戲劇界之地位因之提高。梅君具如是過人之思想及天才。豈僅爲中國有名之戲劇家。即推爲世界唯一之戲劇家。允無愧色。今茲之來。吾人不得以尋常演劇團體之眼光測之。應視爲發揚東方之文化藝術而來。我輩應如何致其歡迎欣謝之意耶。次由當地法院院長演說。引西哲之言。謂一人能以獨到之藝術。供世人之欣賞。實爲世界上最可快樂之事。惜不易致之。今梅君來美。斯眞致之矣。吾人何幸。吾美何幸。而竟遇此世界難得之事耶。繼由畹華起立答詞。措詞得體。詞畢。全塲鼓掌如雷。深夜始散。</p>
<p>二日。中美協進會歡迎全團遊覽市衢。并邀參觀華盛頓大學。午刻應該校中國留學生茶會之招。咸謂梅君此行。爲我國增光。將謀一切之協助云云。晚赴當地五號路劇塲之約。該劇塲係純用中國建築方式搆造。於前年落成。大廳中懸有畹華肖像。猶曩日駐滬美國領事於該院開幕前索取寄贈者也。畹華到時。由劇塲總經理恭迓於門。親贈鮮花盈掬。導入塲内。觀劇之際。台上即有人聲稱（今有由中國來之大藝術宣傳家梅蘭芳先生來此參觀。不勝榮幸之至。）以表歡迎之意。座客聞之。咸大鼓掌。此劇幕將下。演劇之主角又謂梅君今適坐於正面花樓。曷使鐙光集中。俾嘉賓有相見之雅。於是鐙光大明。集中於畹華之身。畹起立鞠躬以答之。衆又鼓掌不已。　　自紐約特來迎迓畹華者甚多。當地記者均來訪問。於是又留西雅圖一日。始乘大北鐡路特備之車東行。送者紛紛麕集。汽笛一聲。揮巾告别。而向紐約進發矣。</p>

<h3>The Second Meeting of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Nine Important Bills Passed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee held its second meeting at 8:00 AM on the third day. Attending were Lin Sen, Hu Hanmin, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, Li Wenfan, Gu Yingfen, He Yingqin, Liu Wendao, Ding Weifen, Liu Luyin, Chen Guofu, Yu Jingtang, Zhang Daofan, Wang Bailing, Ding Chao Wu, Liu Jiwen, Chen Zhaoying, Jiao Yitang, Miao Peicheng, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Enkebatu, Fang Juehui, Lin Yunhai, Chen Yaoyuan, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Gui Chongji, Tan Yankai, Jiang Zhongzheng, Song Ziwen, Ma Chaojun, Wu Jingheng, Li Yuying, Shao Yuanchong, Miao Bin, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, Zeng Yangfu, Wang Zhengting, Kexing'e, Chu Minyi, and Wang Boqun. The meeting was chaired by Hu Hanmin. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) The Standing Committee submitted a proposal to advance routine work. (Reviewed and submitted by the Party Affairs Group) Resolution: Amended and passed.</p>
<p>(2) The Standing Committee submitted a proposal regarding guidelines for training party members. (Reviewed and submitted by the Party Affairs Group) Resolution: Amended and passed.</p>
<p>(3) The Standing Committee submitted a proposal regarding guidelines for construction. (Reviewed and submitted by the Political and Economic Groups) Resolution: Passed. Referred to the Political Conference to formulate implementation guidelines.</p>
<p>(4) The Standing Committee submitted a proposal emphasizing the selection of county magistrates. (Reviewed and submitted by the Political Group) Resolution: Passed in principle. Referred back to the Standing Committee for referral to the competent government authorities to develop appropriate measures, and then decided by the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>(5) The Standing Committee submitted a proposal to eliminate bandits and stabilize society. (Reviewed and submitted by the Political Group) Resolution: Eliminating bandits and stabilizing society has always been a priority of the Central Government. Previously, the national army was devoted to suppressing the rebellion, and progress was inevitably delayed. Local authorities should be strictly ordered by the National Government to strictly implement various regulations and systems to eliminate bandits within a specified timeframe. The original proposal was also submitted to the government for reference.</p>
<p>(6) He Yingqin submitted a proposal to vigorously promote thrift. (Reviewed and submitted by the Economic Group) Resolution: Passed. Referred to the Standing Committee for implementation.</p>
<p>(7) Zhang Renjie, Wu Jingheng, Li Yuying, and Ye Chucang submitted a proposal for the central and local construction agencies to jointly invest in developing water conservancy projects for the Yellow, Tao, Jing, Fen, Luo, and Ying Rivers to alleviate food shortages in the Northwest. (Reviewed and submitted by the Economic Group) Resolution: Amended and passed.</p>
<p>(8) A supplementary proposal was made to add newly arrived committee members to the review committees of each group. Resolution: Committee member Ding Weifen was added to the Party Affairs Group, Committee member Wang Bailing to the Economic Group, and Committee member Chu Minyi to the Education Group.</p>
<p>(9) Liu Wendao, Wang Bailing, Ma Chaojun, Yu Jingtang, Gui Chongji, Chen Zhaoying, Ding Chao Wu, and Shao Yuanchong, eight committee members, submitted a temporary proposal. Upon investigation, the issuance of 24 million yuan in Jin Finance Consolidation Public Bonds was previously approved to reorganize the banknotes of the Jin Province Bank. Recently, the Jin side has adopted cash concentration measures, massively issuing paper currency and prohibiting cash exports, further disrupting the financial situation, which is clearly contrary to the original intent of the Central Government's approval for issuing public bonds. As these bonds have not yet been issued and circulated, it is urgently necessary to revoke the original plan to avoid further losses to the people. Resolution: Passed. (Third Day)</p>
<h3>Financial Department's Revenue and Expenditure Report for the Seventeenth Fiscal Year</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance submitted a revenue and expenditure report for the seventeenth fiscal year to the Third Plenary Session, stating that in the national financial situation of that year, financial unity in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and the three eastern provinces, as well as Ningxia, had not yet been achieved except for customs revenue. Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi were gradually recovered after the pacification of the Gui faction in the summer of the eighteenth year. Shandong and Henan were also under the jurisdiction of the Central Government after the withdrawal of Japanese troops and Feng's army in the summer of the eighteenth year. Other provinces were also placed under jurisdiction near the end of the fiscal year. This report is neither a comprehensive summary of national revenue and expenditure, nor a complete account of the finances of all provinces for the entire year. It is based on a mixed reporting method and can be summarized into two main points: (1) The total amount of central revenue and expenditure for one year. (2) The total amount of revenue and expenditure of various provinces and regions after being gradually recovered by the central government is listed as follows. Regarding the revenue part: (A) Tax revenue: (1) Customs duties, salt tax, cigarette and kerosene tax, tax remittances from various provinces, tobacco and alcohol tax, stamp tax, wheat flour special tax, parcel post tax, mining tax, etc., totaling 260,554,396 yuan. (2) Miscellaneous items, including contract verification fees, fines, proceeds from confiscated goods, registration fees, etc., totaling 1,918,710 yuan. (3) Unclassified items, such as unremitted revenue from various provinces (direct allocation of military expenses) and special business taxes, totaling 70,006,444 yuan. (B) Repayments: such as the return of Russian funds, the return of surplus funds, etc., totaling 1,816,916 yuan. (C) Bond loans: including public bonds, treasury bills, loans, bank debts, etc., totaling 100,144,245 yuan. The grand total is 434,440,712 yuan. Regarding the expenditure part: (A) Expenditure of funds, including party affairs expenses of 4,040,000 yuan, political affairs expenses of 28,088,394 yuan, military affairs expenses of 209,536,969 yuan, other expenses, such as subsidies to various provinces, various subsidy fees, refunds of various amounts, miscellaneous expenses, etc., totaling 60,254,72 yuan. (B) Repayment of debts, totaling 121,318,007 yuan. Payment of foreign indemnities, totaling 38,663,189 yuan. Advance allocation of Central Bank shares, totaling 20,000,000 yuan. Temporary advances, totaling 6,768,679 yuan. The grand total is 434,440,712 yuan. (Third Day)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Reports Difficulties in Establishing a Budget</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance reported to the Third Plenary Session on the difficulties in establishing a budget, citing the inability to predict the need for and limitations on military spending. For example, in February of the eighteenth year, the First Disbandment Conference resolved to limit annual military spending to 192 million yuan, excluding disbandment costs. However, the Gui and Feng warlords successively initiated disturbances, rendering the resolution a mere formality. After the Gui and Feng issues were resolved, another disbandment conference was held, increasing military pay to 216 million yuan per year, plus 30 million yuan for disbandment costs. However, internal conflicts soon broke out again, and the government had to raise military funds and overcome the difficulty of borrowing from all sources. From July of the seventeenth year to June of the eighteenth year, the total military expenditure was 209,536,969 yuan. The expenses of the three eastern provinces, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi are not included. If these provinces are included, the total would exceed the set amount by an unknown number. How should the country's military spending be limited so that the Ministry of Finance does not have to constantly struggle to make ends meet and has the resources to consider construction and repay domestic and foreign debts? The key to this is national peace, which is beyond the Ministry of Finance's ability to achieve. If this issue is resolved satisfactorily, then</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>India Under World Attention</h3>
<p>This reporter previously argued that India's non-violent resistance would not be easy to implement, based on the observation that all conflicts in the world initially aim to avoid violent resistance, but ultimately cannot escape the proliferation of violence. Gandhi previously published an article stating that violent acts are the sole crisis of non-violent resistance, hence his forceful warning against violent acts to demonstrate his determination to implement non-violent resistance. However, his "ultimatum," which was prepared to be implemented, was issued yesterday. Mr. Patel, his second-in-command, has already declared that a war unprecedented in world history will break out within days and advised those who fear death and the wealthy to leave the country. This means that on the day they prepared to begin resistance with non-violence, they had already prepared to follow up with overwhelming force. Gandhi, mindful of the previous bloodshed and tragedies that violated the principle of benevolence, created this non-violent resistance. However, if the result still leads to a situation where violence is unavoidable, then India is feared to become increasingly trapped in unpredictable circumstances. Today's India is under the attention of all countries in the world. The recent surge in gold prices was initially attributed to India's adoption of the gold standard. The continued rise was attributed to the imposition of silver tax in India. Today, Reuters' Osaka dispatch reports that India plans to increase import duties on cotton cloth, and Japanese spinning mills and cotton merchants have jointly expressed opposition, which has attracted significant attention. After India made this proposal, securities fell, and so on. Today, the world's finance and commerce are all related to India. If domestic movements for independence cause further war and turmoil, the impact will not be limited to the people of that country alone. Therefore, I say that today's India deserves attention.</p>
<h3>Received Domestic Important Telegrams</h3>

<h3>Reorganization of Domestic and Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>Detailed Measures Submitted to the Plenary Session</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the reorganization of domestic and foreign debt, the Ministry of Finance previously formulated detailed measures through the Domestic and Foreign Debt Reorganization Committee. After review by Song, the Finance Minister, they have been submitted to the Third Plenary Session. The content is roughly divided into two steps: (1) The government will allocate 5 million yuan annually to prepare for future liquidation, starting this year. (2) Foreign debt will be consolidated in a way that ensures no loss of national or financial rights. Implementation will begin after a decision is made at the Third Plenary Session.

<h3>The Third Plenary Session Passes the Water Conservancy Development Proposal</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session passed on the third day the proposal for the central and local construction agencies to jointly invest in developing water conservancy projects for the Yellow, Tao, Jing, Wei, Fen, Luo, and Ying Rivers to alleviate food shortages in the Northwest. The full text is as follows: (Reasons) Domestic agricultural production is decreasing daily, and people are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain food. Increasing agricultural production is now an urgent matter. Undertaking water conservancy projects is a key strategy to increase agricultural production. The Northwestern provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan are the earliest areas of proliferation for the Chinese nation, and have long relied on the irrigation and benefits from the major rivers of the Yellow, Tao, Jing, Wei, Fen, Luo, and Ying Rivers, thus cultivating fertile soil and abundant products. The Qin, Han, Tang, and Song dynasties frequently repaired the rivers and diverted canals for irrigation, which is recorded in history with verifiable effects. Since the late Qing Dynasty, politics have gradually become disordered, and water conservancy in the Northwest has fallen into disrepair. In recent years, rivers have become silted up, canals have collapsed, rainfall has been scarce, and droughts have been frequent. The provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan have experienced famine, with people eating each other, and the southeastern provinces have also been affected by food shortages and widespread suffering. Therefore, if we want to reverse the current crisis of lack of production in our country, experts know that immigration and reclamation are key strategies. However, if the northern canals are not managed and water conservancy is not developed, then immigration will only be a sacrifice to drought demons and will not increase production. Therefore, repairing the rivers in the Northwest and developing water conservancy is more urgent than other places and other projects. It is now proposed to follow the established rules of past dynasties for rivers and canals, adopt scientific irrigation methods, and carry out repairs in stages, so that barren land can be transformed into fertile land and disasters and famine can be permanently eliminated, and abundant harvests can be ensured. The benefits of this are immeasurable. (Measures) (1) Funding arrangements: the temporary budget is set at 5 million yuan per year, with the central government responsible for 3 million yuan and the local governments responsible for 2 million yuan. Starting from March of the nineteenth year, the National Government will instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate 3 million yuan annually, and the local governments will allocate 2 million yuan, to be shared by Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan through consultation. (2) Project implementation: in the first year, 90% of the funding will be used for urgent repairs to the various rivers, simultaneously, with the intention of providing work in exchange for wages. The remaining 10% will be used for detailed surveying to design permanent projects. From the second year onwards, the plans will be implemented, and when the work is completed here, it will be carried out there. It is estimated that within seven years, the repair of the Yellow River loop and the six other rivers can be substantially completed. How to continue repairs in the future will be determined at that time. (3) Project planning and management: the Construction Committee will jointly organize a Northwest River Repair Office with the Construction Departments of the five provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan to handle all matters related to investigation, surveying, planning, and engineering. (4) Recovery of funds: after the completion of the project, all the fields along the rivers will be able to receive the benefits of water conservancy. Therefore, the funds used for repairs can be collected from the beneficiary fields in installments and used to develop other water conservancy projects. Detailed measures will be discussed and determined by the Construction Committee in conjunction with the relevant provinces. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Issues a Telegram Urging Peace</h3>
<p>Hoping That All Compatriots Throughout the Country Will See the Dangerous Situation and Eliminate Internal Conflicts</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast, addressed to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all Yuan, Departments, Committees, Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, Provincial and Municipal Governments, General Command Headquarters, Command Headquarters, Military, Divisional, and Brigade Headquarters, Legal Entities, and Newspaper Offices. The country is in distress. To survive, it is necessary to end disputes. Construction is in progress. To succeed, it is necessary to work together. Chairman Jiang and Vice Commander Bai are pillars of the Party and the country, and the hope of the people. They have recently taken different paths in the art of serving the country, one proactive and one passive, resulting in different views on the ways to save the country and suppress the rebellion. The exchange of sharp words can easily lead to misunderstandings. The clamorous declarations are particularly concerning as they may lead to armed conflict. Upon hearing this news, I am deeply concerned. Since the completion of unification, more than a decade has passed in an instant. In terms of military administration, it should be concluded as scheduled. In terms of political tutelage, further efforts are still needed. However, looking back, there have been frequent military conflicts in the country. Looking around, the people have not yet recovered from their distress. In addition, disasters are frequent, industry and commerce are depressed, transportation is half-blocked, and bandits are rampant. At this time, if we do not abandon our prejudices and resolve disputes together, we will inevitably deplete our vitality and shake our foundations. The foreigners surrounding us will take advantage of this to fulfill their desires. The tragedy of the nation and the people perishing will not end. Thinking of this, how can one not be alarmed? In my humble opinion, differing political views are permissible and should not lead to disputes driven by emotions. Military force is sometimes necessary, but should not be used for fratricidal strife. I know my own inferiority and dare not offer my own political views. However, in the past year, there have been repeated internal conflicts. Even if I lack the power to prevent problems before they arise, I know that merely addressing the symptoms is not enough. Therefore, I do not hesitate to make earnest appeals, hoping that peace will emerge soon. After the divergence of political views between Jiang and Bai, I have repeatedly sent telegrams expressing my views on peace and resolving disputes, hoping to gain their attention. I have also contributed my humble opinions to the commanders throughout the country, hoping to promote unity and eliminate hidden dangers. My mouth dares not remain silent, and my actions dare not be ambiguous. This heartfelt intention is worthy of common understanding. Different paths can lead to the same goal. It is important to be cautious from the beginning. Chairman Jiang is dedicated to serving the country with the utmost effort. Bai analyzes the details with the intention of seeking truth from facts. It is feared that detailed words may not be comprehensive enough, causing temporary misunderstandings and arousing suspicion among the public, or even fueling the flames and leading to war. If this happens, then the two men's desire to save the country will not be fulfilled, and the disaster of national ruin will arrive first, which is beyond the expectations of the two men and is something that Xueliang cannot bear to say. It is hoped that all compatriots throughout the country will see the dangerous situation, focus on the threats from abroad, and eliminate internal conflicts. We should work together with sincerity to seek common relief. I especially hope that Jiang and Bai can embrace the spirit of camaraderie and analyze the dangers of war, exercising the power entrusted to them by the Party and the country to lead the people. I am stationed on the border and have dedicated myself to the country. I will offer my sincere opinions on all matters that benefit the Party and the country and do not contradict peace, without fear of offense. If everyone is united and immediately takes action, there is hope for China's future. I sincerely offer this to the people for their observation. Zhang Xueliang bows and imprints.

<h3>Jiang Replies to Zhang Xueliang's Telegram</h3>
<p>Deeply Hoping That You Will Speak Up for Justice and Urge Yan to Realize the Truth</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang replied to Zhang Xueliang's telegram: Commander Zhang Hanqing, Shenyang, honorable brother, I have read your telegram of the East, which deeply laments the dangerous situation and advocates for peace. In addition to my admiration, it has increased my sorrow. The beginning of political tutelage and peaceful unification are the unanimous demands of the entire country. The Central Government adheres to this principle and has never wavered. There are reactionary elements who fear losing their feudal power and do not hesitate to betray the Party and disrupt the country. The Central Government will only resort to force as a last resort. The facts are clear, and the whole world understands. Bai has been ordered to suppress the rebellion and personally leads his troops. He should understand this intent. If he does not create additional problems, unification will be achieved, and there will be no more war. Unexpectedly, after the end of the war, he picked up the leftovers of the reactionary elements to shake the hearts of the people. I cannot fathom Bai's intentions and absolutely do not want peace to be easily broken. I have repeatedly sent telegrams to Hu, Tan, and Wang, urging him to realize the truth. Although Bai has repeatedly stated that he is only speaking for the Party and the country and has no other intentions, his alliance with military men and advocacy of erroneous ideas are not something that those who advise the Party and the country should do. According to reliable reports, Bai has ordered his troops and persuaded the Northwestern Army and the troops in Henan to mobilize south. He has also appointed Xu Yongchang as the commander-in-chief of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, Han Fuju as the commander-in-chief of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, and commanders-in-chief of various army groups in the name of the Army of the Republic of China. His troops under Fu Zuoyi are marching south from Cangzhou.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Feng Pengju's troops have already occupied Caozhou. Other divisions are concentrated on the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, advancing south in stages. Since the beginning of the previous month, they have detained trains on the Jinpu Railway, disrupting national transportation. Today, they have taken over the central government's agencies in Pingjin, expelled central government-appointed personnel, and even arrested them. Now, I have received reports from the Party Headquarters in Beiping Province and City stating that they have dispatched troops and police to surround the Party Headquarters, seal off central government propaganda agencies, and arrest Lu Dangping, a member of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and Party members in Beiping City. I am deeply afraid that the peaceful unification cannot be guaranteed. Without central government orders, they can mobilize troops at will, occupy other provinces, appoint commanders-in-chief and general commanders, detain vehicles, obstruct transportation, confiscate agencies, arrest officials, disregard laws and regulations, create the so-called Army of the Republic of China, surround Party Headquarters, and arrest Party members. If this is permissible, then what will become of the Party, the country, and the revolution? How can we achieve the unification and independence of the country? The Central Government still hopes that Bai's various erroneous actions are due to being threatened and surrounded by reactionary elements and that he can realize the truth. I also know that Bai wants to use our comrades-in-arms but has not been able to do so. Recently, various parties have sent telegrams denying their inclusion in the Yang telegram. Brothers Xiangfang and Hanzhang have sent telegrams calling for peace. All of this proves that right and wrong, and obedience and disobedience, cannot be confused in the end. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee still upholds leniency and resolves to first send special envoys to investigate the truth. We still hope that you will untie the knot yourself. The Central Government's efforts to seek compromise are obvious to all. You love the Party and the country and place great expectations on me and Bai. You are also extremely sincere at this time. I hope that you will also appoint special envoys to conduct a thorough investigation of the facts and speak up for justice to urge Bai to reflect. As long as Party Headquarters at all levels can still perform their duties, arrested comrades are released, troops are not mobilized at will to invade other provinces, the troops in Lu and Yu are withdrawn within a limited time, the so-called Army of the Republic of China's appointment orders are clearly revoked, transportation on the Jinpu Railway and the agencies in Pingjin are restored to their original state, and all reactionary elements in Pingjin, such as Wang Faqin, Zhao Pilian, Guo Chuntao, Xie Chi, and Zou Lu, are expelled, so that the laws and regulations of the Republic of China are still upheld and the orders of the National Government are implemented. Bai's personal expression of sincerity, even if his words exceed the norm, his intentions can be made clear. The world will understand Bai's courage to change for the better, and the Central Government will always preserve Bai's glorious revolutionary name, and peaceful unification can be achieved, and public and private interests can be satisfied. The Party and the country will thank you for your great gift. Otherwise, peaceful unification, which is unanimously demanded by the entire country, is deliberately undermined, placing the Party and the country in danger and causing compatriots to die. What kind of necessary sanctions should be used to protect peaceful unification? You bear the heavy responsibility of the Party and the country, treat the people as if they were wounded, and see justice and act bravely. You must have a way to support unification and maintain peace. Do not regard this as a personal dispute between me and Bai. It is a matter of life and death for the Party and the country. I hope you will teach me more. I respectfully send this special telegram and hope you will examine it carefully. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northwestern Generals Jointly Telegraph to Invite Feng Back to Shaanxi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to reports, after Feng arrived in Taiyuan on the 28th, Pang Bingxun telegraphed to Xi'an. That night, dozens of Northwestern generals jointly telegraphed to Pang, asking him to forward their welcome to Feng and urging him to return to Shaanxi. Feng's old subordinates are all listed in the telegram, except for Han Shiming. (Third Day)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to evening newspaper reports, after Feng arrived in Taiyuan, many people visited him in recent days. According to Feng's statement, he had previously decided to travel abroad, but friends persuaded him to stay. He has not changed his mind and will still travel abroad at an appropriate time to increase his knowledge so that he can serve the country in the future. At this time, he does not want to take on any military duties. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Headquarters announced the Beiping telegram: (1) Yan has promised to provide 3 million yuan in military expenses to the Northwestern Army, but has not yet paid it. The Northwestern Army has sent Pang Bingxun and Liu Ji as representatives to Taiyuan to demand payment. (2) On the surface, Feng Yuxiang seems to have a good relationship with Yan, but according to those close to Feng, he repeatedly tried to escape while in Jian'an Village, but was stopped by Yan. Feng once said to Du Chunyi, the commander of Yan's guard brigade, "If you don't allow me to leave, please convey three things to Bai Chuan: (1) It is better to shoot me than to imprison me like this for a long time. (2) Or tie me up and send me to the Central Government. (3) If you keep your promise, quickly send me abroad with you." Judging from Feng's attitude, he hates Yan to the bone. In this terrible environment, he maintains a negative attitude and seems unlikely to cooperate with Yan thoroughly. (Third Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Again that night, many Russian party members paraded in the streets at night. When the police tried to dissuade them, they were beaten and humiliated. According to foreign news, the Russian side is doing its best to avoid misunderstandings regarding the handling of matters in the East Road and has ordered Mr. Mei, the Russian consul in Harbin, to be an international commander. However, Russian expatriates in various places frequently act beyond their bounds, which is a regrettable matter in international relations. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Measures for Guaranteeing Railway Loans after the Abolition of Inland Taxes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways received letters from Chinese and foreign banks in Beiping and the National City Bank of New York, stating that regarding the matter of guarantees for the Huguang Railway loan, now that the National Government has announced that, starting from October 10th of this year, the abolition of inland taxes will be implemented nationwide, please handle the matter of allocating the loan according to Article 9 of the contract through the Maritime Customs Service. The Ministry of Railways considers that this article stipulates that annual salt tax of 950,000 taels of customs silver and annual inland taxes on general merchandise from the two Hubei provinces of 4,250,000 taels of customs silver will be the first mortgage, and it is stipulated that in the event of amendments to the customs tariff or reductions and exemptions from inland taxes, the banks should be consulted first, and the newly added customs duties should be allocated to fully compensate for the principal and interest of the loan as soon as possible. In recent years, only 950,000 taels of customs silver have been allocated annually from the salt tax, which is far from sufficient. Now that the abolition of inland taxes has been announced, according to the contract, annual inland tax revenues from the two Hubei provinces of 4,250,000 taels of customs silver should be allocated from customs duties to repay the principal and interest. Furthermore, the original loan for the Jinpu Railway was guaranteed by annual inland taxes from Zhili, Shandong, and Jiangsu of 3,800,000 taels of customs silver, and the subsequent loan for the Jinpu Railway was guaranteed by annual inland taxes from Zhili, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui of 3,600,000 taels of customs silver. Each contract also stipulates that in the event of amendments to the customs tariff or reductions and exemptions from inland taxes, the customs duties must be allocated in full to compensate for the original and subsequent loans for the Jinpu Railway. The total amount to be allocated annually as a guarantee is 7,400,000 taels of customs silver. After the abolition of inland taxes, customs duties should be designated as a guarantee to show national credibility. It has now been consulted with the Ministry of Finance for review and handling.

<h3>London Conference May Be Prolonged</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, New York, 2nd: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Adams broadcast his speech from the London radio station, saying that the London Naval Conference may be prolonged, and the public should be patient. He also said that the U.S. and Japanese delegations are gradually reaching an understanding. The expenses of the delegations staying in London for a long time are not large, less than the cost of supplying a small cruiser. The positions of Britain and the U.S. are not far apart, so it should not be difficult for them to reach an understanding with Japan soon. The delay in France and Italy's reconsideration is due to the fall of the French government and no other reason. The only loss is time. Once the French delegation returns, it will continue to discuss various matters.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News, London, 2nd: Plenipotentiary Matsudaira visited the U.S. plenipotentiary at 7:00 PM today for a meeting lasting 30 minutes. Plenipotentiary Matsudaira has already presented Japan's countermeasures, but the content of the negotiations between the two sides is highly confidential.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United News, Tokyo, 3rd: The Disarmament Conference is not progressing. As of today, the points on which countries have reached a principled understanding are the extension of the construction moratorium for battleships and the reduction in the number of ships. The issue of the number of auxiliary vessels held by each country and other important matters have not been resolved. The issue of Japan's seven-to-seven ratio with the U.S. may reach a concrete numerical issue in the middle of next week. As of today, the points on which a principled understanding has been reached are as follows: Battleships: In order to achieve the holding ratio of 5:5:3 stipulated in the Washington Treaty, Britain will scrap five battleships, the U.S. three, and Japan one. The construction moratorium will be extended to 1936. The age of the ships will be changed from 20 years to 26 years. Cruisers: Although a general compromise has been reached between Britain and the U.S., there is still a difference of 24,000 tons in the total tonnage of large and small cruisers. The age of the ships is 20 years. Aircraft carriers: Auxiliary aircraft carriers under 10,000 tons, which have never been restricted, are also included in the restriction. For ships over 10,000 tons, the age is changed from 20 years to 26 years, and for those under 10,000 tons, it is set at 20 years. Destroyers: The maximum displacement of each destroyer is set at 1,850 tons, and ordinary destroyers are 1,500 tons, equipped with 5-inch guns. The age of the ships is 16 years.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd: According to a certain key figure, the rumor that the U.S. has made a new proposal to Japan to reduce the navy is an exaggeration. The delegations of the U.S. and Japan are now starting negotiations again in London, intending to find a solution in the midst of difficulties. However, no formal new proposals have been exchanged. The details of the proposals of both sides are being kept strictly secret to prevent causing emotions among the people and affecting the progress of the solution. Therefore, even the Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not know the details of the progress.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd: 1,200 famous American men and women, including 200 university presidents, 8 state governors, and several giant merchants, representing the whole country, jointly telegraphed the U.S. delegation to the London Naval Conference, urging them to reduce naval armaments and not only focus on limiting them.</p>

If he is arrested, the leadership of the non-violent resistance will fall to Patel, the brother of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, who advocated non-payment of taxes in Bardoli last year. Today, Patel said that a war unprecedented in world history will break out in a few days, starting in Gujarat. Those who are afraid of death can make a pilgrimage to Santiago, and the wealthy can leave the country. Gandhi's secretary toured the Gujarat region and has now returned. According to reports, the government salt warehouses in the region are not allowed to be violated, and violators will be shot. However, everyone along the entire coast has the right to produce salt. After the non-violent resistance begins, village and town officials must resign, farmers must sever relations with government agencies, and government employees must be rejected. As for the level of tax resistance, it will be proposed for implementation when the people are prepared.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd: The Indian Princes' Conference passed a resolution welcoming the granting of overseas autonomy to India at the earliest possible date, but expressed disagreement with the demand of a certain faction to separate from Britain.</p>
<h3>A Precursor to the Special Session of the Japanese Diet</h3>
<p>The Speakers and Standing Committee Members Have Been Largely Decided</p>
<p>Denstsu News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The Minseito, having won an absolute majority, has decided to monopolize the positions of Speaker and Deputy Speaker and the chairmen of all standing committees at the upcoming special session of the Diet. The candidate for Speaker is Ikanosuke Fujisawa, and there is no possibility of change. The candidates for Deputy Speaker with a high likelihood are Tokuzo Hirose, Giichi Masuda, Keijiro Nakamura, Matsuju Oyama, and incumbent Vice Minister of Home Affairs Takashi Saito. If Saito is appointed Deputy Speaker, his successor will be Keijiro Nakamura. For the positions of chairmen of the standing committees, Shigeta Juuta is likely to be appointed chairman of the Budget Committee, Hiroshi Asakawa chairman of the Accounts Committee, Bunjirou Noda chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, and Tanjiro Amemura chairman of the Petition Committee. As for the position of chairman of the plenary committee, the most likely candidate is Kanichirou Ohtake of the Innovation faction. This is an exception.</p>
<p>Denstsu News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The government has decided to deal with the special session of the Diet with policy issues. Even if the opposition party attacks the government with the Kobayashi issue, the Taisho Commerce Minister issue, and the issue of discipline, the government will not engage in debate. A certain influential member of the Minseito told someone that even if the opposition party attacks the government over election interference, the government will allow them to vent their grievances to the fullest extent and does not intend to engage in debate. Election interference is a misinterpretation of the government's policy. Even if there are one or two instances of police interference in elections locally, it is not a problem overall. The disarmament issue and the Obata agreement issue can be explained by Foreign Minister Shidehara to dispel misunderstandings. The authorities do not attach importance to these issues and intend to devote their full efforts to increasing the state's share of compulsory education expenses and providing relief to the unemployed after the lifting of the gold embargo, which will surely be passed by the House of Representatives with an absolute majority. What is difficult to be optimistic about is the attitude of the House of Peers, but the government will not be unreasonable and has decided to fight on the basis of policy. The upper house should not make it too difficult.</p>
<h3>The Tardieu New Cabinet Convened Today</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 2nd: The Tardieu new cabinet is formed. Twenty members of the previous cabinet retained their positions. Only Navy Minister Leiguy, Public Works Minister Rouchet, and Finance Minister Chauron resigned. Chauron's financial policy was the cause of the previous cabinet's failure. Several of the new cabinet members were selected from the extreme left wing, as Tardieu wanted to appease the opposition in that area. The cabinet is scheduled to meet on Tuesday and can attend Parliament on Wednesday. The delegation to the conference, except for Tardieu, will go to London on Thursday, but Tardieu must stay in Paris for a few more days.</p>
<h3>Japan's Unemployed Reaches Hundreds of Thousands</h3>
<p>Denstsu News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The total number of unemployed people in Japan cannot be determined because there are no accurate statistics. However, according to the estimates of the Social Bureau, it is approximately 300,000. However, since last year, various factories such as the Mitsui rayon mill and paper mills have implemented reduced work hours, and the actual number must be far more than that, probably over 700,000 or 800,000. Labor disputes are frequent in various places, and the suffering of unemployed workers is becoming more and more profound. The government and the private sector are seeking relief. The most urgent method is to establish a public unemployment compulsory insurance system, first implemented for workers in various factories and mines, and then gradually extended to others. The Proletarian Reform Party has long had a proposal for unemployment insurance and intends to submit it to the Diet to force the government to implement it. The Social Masses Party has already drafted a bill.</p>
<h3>U.S.-China Trade Affected by Silver Depreciation</h3>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 2nd: The Indian authorities began implementing import taxes yesterday. The reasons are half due to the repeated fall in silver prices in New York and London, and half due to the future of India. A group of people who are well aware of the economic situation all said in unison that the sluggishness of the silver market has greatly affected American trade with China. The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that the freight volume in the Pacific area in the first two months of this year was the lowest in many years. The Department of Commerce also said that trade in the Shanghai area is much better than in the Tianjin area. No less than a hundred small businesses in North China engaged in export trade have gone bankrupt, all due to the impact of the silver market and commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Revisions to the League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 2nd: The committee to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations has agreed on Article 12 of the Covenant. The draft states, "Member States agree to resolve any disputes that may arise in the future that are sufficient to cause severance of relations by peaceful means only. If this is still not resolved, then it shall be submitted to arbitration or the Administrative Council of this League for investigation. In any case, it shall not resort to war again." However, many League of Nations personnel say that there are still imperfections in the article, because the phrase "If this is still not resolved" still has shortcomings. If one party claims that peaceful means have not yet been exhausted and delays it, it will be impossible to deal with it. Therefore, it is expected that it may not be possible to pass it in the Council in the future.</p>
<h3>German Diet Reviews the Young Plan</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The German Diet's committee for reviewing the Young Plan passed the plan yesterday by a vote of 29 to 23. The Central Party and the Bavarian People's Party members of the committee, although belonging to the government party, did not vote. If the two parties' members still do not vote at the general assembly in the future, it may be difficult for this plan to pass. However, the government mostly believes that this is only a warning to other parties due to differences in opinion on domestic politics. Cabinet members will not follow the old path again in the future, shaking diplomacy. Moreover, the National Socialist Party's request to separate the Oder agreement from the Young Plan was also rejected by the committee by a vote of 29 to 26, which can give a glimpse of the true attitude of the Diet members towards the Young Plan.</p>
<h3>The British Prince Is Sick in Africa</h3>
<p>Reuters, Nairobi, Africa, 2nd: Official sources say that the British Prince went hunting in the territory of Wei on February 28 and suddenly returned here last night because he contracted a fever. It is expected that he will recover in a few days. The British Prince recently flew over the area and saw herds of lions, elephants, and buffalo, so he decided to move to that area in order to hunt nearby. A further telegram states that the fever usually subsides gradually after 48 hours, but the temperature is quite high during the onset, and the patient is very uncomfortable. Therefore, the British Prince is naturally weak after contracting this illness.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: Members of the royal family were greatly surprised to hear the news that the Prince was ill. Sir Costantini, a London expert on tropical diseases, told a Reuters reporter tonight that the Prince's fever has been treated quickly and there is no cause for concern. After the Prince's fever subsides, it is best to rest in Nairobi for half a month before returning to England. He does not advise him to stay in Africa for a long time.</p>
<h3>Taft Is Critically Ill</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 2nd: Former Chief Justice Taft is still conscious today, but his blood pressure is very low. According to the doctors' report, Taft's condition today is worse than yesterday. (Continuing telegram) Although Taft consumed more nutrients tonight, his consciousness is muddled, and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Estimation of Unemployment in the United States</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd – Republican Senator Brookhart estimates that there are between three and six million unemployed people nationwide, a very dangerous situation. He has requested Congress to approve an appropriation of $50 million for relief efforts and to devise methods to prevent the Communist Party from organizing large-scale demonstrations by the unemployed. According to a recent report to Congress by the Labor Federation, 22 percent of organized labor was unemployed in February, and 43 percent of workers in the construction industry were idle. The unemployment situation has reached a dangerous point, which coincides with Brookhart's statement.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Tin Production Last Month</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd – Tin market statistics for the end of February show that the supply of tin increased by 4,100 tons in February, with total reserves reaching approximately 37,000 tons. This is the highest record in ten years. According to the Financial Times, American demand is extremely low, and large quantities are arriving from the East, leading to a significant increase in reserves. However, the current reduction in production will have an impact on future supply figures, so it can be said that the time of adversity has passed. Some estimate that the current production reduction plan for global tin mines could reduce the annual output of mined tin by 17,000 tons.</p>
<h3>India Increases Import Duty on Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Great Panic in the Japanese Cotton Industry</p>
<p>Reuters, Osaka, 3rd – The Japan Cotton Spinners' Association and the Cotton Merchants' Association jointly issued a statement today regarding India's proposed increase in import duties on cotton cloth. It stated that there would be no objection to raising tax rates for revenue purposes, but the tax rate proposed by India exempts a certain tax on British goods, which account for the largest share of imported cotton goods, while creating an effective barrier for Japanese goods. The new tax rate proposes to levy a 15 percent tax on British goods and a 20 percent tax on Japanese goods. Such an ad valorem tax of 12%, if converted into a value-added tax, would be more than 20%, and in some types of cotton goods, even as high as 38%. Such a measure is excessively discriminatory and will make fair competition impossible. The developing Indo-Japanese trade, whether import or export, is feared to be strangled by this new tax rate. Furthermore, it is questionable whether this proposal reflects the will of the Indian people, as the purpose of the new tax is to protect the interests of Lancashire, to the detriment of the Indian masses. If the precedent of preferential tax rates is established in India, it will sooner or later be extended to other goods besides cotton. If preferential treatment is indeed necessary, Japanese cotton goods should seek the most favorable consideration, as Japanese cotton goods contain more than 25% of Indian cotton. This matter has now attracted great attention, as securities have fallen due to this proposal by India.</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin to Visit Japan</h3>
<p>Nichi-Ren, Tokyo, 3rd – According to a San Francisco telegram received by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, American screen star Charlie Chaplin has decided to visit Japan and is scheduled to depart from San Francisco on the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru on April 26th.</p>
<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Memorial Week at the Party Headquarters and National Government</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Gives Important Report on the Current Situation</p>
<p>At nine o'clock in the morning on the third, the Central Party Headquarters held its 49th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. Central Committee members Lin Sen, Hu Hanmin, Ye Chucang, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Chonghui, Li Wenfan, Gu Yingfen, He Yingqin, Liu Wendao, Ding Weifen, Liu Luyin, Chen Guofu, Yu Jingtang, Zhang Daofan, Wang Boling, Ding Chao-wu, Liu Jiwen, Chen Zhaoying, Jiao Yitang, Miao Peicheng, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Jiahua, Enhe Batu, Fang Juehui, Lin Yunhai, Chen Yaoyuan, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Gui Chongji, Qian Yan, Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Ma Chaojun, Wu Jingheng, Li Yuying, Shao Yuanchong, Miao Bin, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, Zeng Yangfu, Wang Zhengting, Kexing'e, Chu Minyi, Wang Boqun, and others, totaling 47 people, as well as staff and guests, more than 600 people in total, attended. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek performed the rituals, Chairman Chiang gave the following political report:</p>
<p>(Fellow comrades, in recent weeks, politically, since Yan Xishan and a group of military men jointly issued the Yang telegram on the 23rd, implementing opposition to the Party, almost all party members and the masses throughout the country have been paying attention to this matter. Now, not only is it causing public unrest, but even the rapidly unifying foundation of our Party and state is also showing a trend of shaking. This matter is extremely serious. Until</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>now, no substantial resolution has been reached. Therefore, on the first day of the third plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, the first resolution was to dispatch Committee Member Li Shizeng, Committee Member Zhang Puquan, and President of the Control Yuan Zhao Daiwen to investigate this matter. The intention is to show that our Party truly and genuinely desires the peaceful unification of China, does not want any more wars, and hopes that those who spread such erroneous arguments will quickly realize their mistakes and voluntarily maintain their revolutionary honor. Since the Yang telegram, led by Yan Xishan, was issued, up to today, almost all of the people listed in the telegram have issued statements declaring that their names were used without their consent or stolen. Except for a portion of the listed generals who have already rebelled and have not made any statements, almost all the others have made statements. In addition, there are bandit troops like Sun Dianying's, as well as several people listed from Fujian, who are just bandit leaders whose names are not even known. Whether they have joined the Party or not, those who led the telegram did not even inquire. These bandit leaders, enemies of the Party and state, also come to talk about the affairs of the country and the Party, which is truly a great joke. Looking at it from these aspects, what exactly is the matter of Yan Baichuan leading the issuance of the Yang telegram? It is truly bewildering. Why can someone who has not joined the Party, and is even engaged in bandit activities, also come out to interfere in Party affairs? Not to mention Mr. Wu Zhihui's article of several thousand words questioning him, I only have one question to ask him: How many of the generals who jointly signed the telegram have joined the Party? Asking him only this one question is enough to understand whether they are truly for the Party and the country, or whether they want to gather a group of bandits to cause trouble, preventing the Party and the state from being peaceful and unified. The fact is indeed like this. Therefore, not long after the Yang telegram was issued on the 23rd, not only did many of the people who jointly signed the telegram come out to deny it, but also to criticize him. Even those he called upon, such as Han Fuqu and Shi Yousan in Henan, also sent telegrams, saying that even if the country had a major crisis that could not be resolved, everything still had to be handled by the Party Headquarters. In this way, the Yang telegram was completely canceled. Yan Xishan's words were completely nonsense. This further proves that although our Party has many great dangers, the Party cannot succeed in the revolution without going through these dangers. I believe that after this danger, everyone will have a clearer understanding of the Party's theory and the Party's position, and the foundation of our Party will be further consolidated at this time. We can also believe in the power of the Party. We have now unified the country, and the Party's principles can also be realized step by step from now on. In the near future, the troops of Yan Baichuan and others in Henan and Shandong may retreat naturally without the use of force. From this point of view, the power of our Party is not comparable to what it was a few years ago. Now, even without the use of force, we can unify the country. In the future, no warlord will dare to come out and oppose our Party again, or advocate erroneous arguments like Yan Baichuan. Furthermore, we still very much hope that Yan Baichuan can quickly realize his mistakes due to this action, and truly become a comrade of our Party, instead of being manipulated by reactionaries and becoming a tool for counter-revolution. Furthermore, yesterday I received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Zhang Hanqing of Liaoning. His telegram advocates for peace. He expressed that he very much wants the country to be free of trouble and to be peacefully unified. At the same time, I immediately sent him a reply in my personal capacity. There are a few points in the telegram that I can report on today (the text of the telegram will be recorded separately after the report, and the report will continue). I believe that Zhang Hanqing will definitely uphold justice and work together for peace. Therefore, it is even more believable that the foundation of the Party and the state is already stable, and no warlord will dare to oppose the Party in the future. However, there is still a danger, which is that this time the matter is a political and military action on one hand, and on the other hand, because Yan Baichuan is surrounded by reactionaries, he initially wanted to use the National Assembly to suppress the Party, preventing the Party from speaking out and canceling all resolutions. However, later he felt that he could not do this, and thought of another method: what is the total vote of party members to vote on party affairs? What is this all about? It is to coerce our party, destroy our party, and cause our party to disintegrate, that is, to abandon the party, so that they can freely carry out their counter-revolutionary activities. This is completely a conspiracy dream, wanting to use our party members to destroy the party. Comrades must fully understand this point. This is very serious and related to the survival of the party and the country. It is also a great danger to our party at present. I hope that all comrades will do their best to jointly break through this danger, realize the principles of our party, and implement the resolutions of our party, so that the foundation of our party can be truly consolidated. Only in this way can we be worthy of being party members and can we complete the purpose of the revolution. This is all for my contribution today.) After Mr. Chiang finished his report, he announced the completion of the ceremony and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>▲At ten o'clock in the morning of the same day, the National Government held its weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. He Yaozu, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhang Nanxian, Wei Daoming, Chen Yu, Chiang Menglin, Li Jinlun, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Li Zhonggong, Yang Jie, Sun Bowen, and more than 200 staff members from the National Government's civil service and military affairs departments attended. He Yaozu chaired the ceremony. After the rituals, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report:</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee opened. The significance of this plenary session is very important. Since the Central Committee purged Tang Shengzhi, it has devoted all its efforts to reforming politics, and all the specific plans for reforming politics are waiting for this plenary session to discuss. I believe the results will be good. All resolutions must be in line with the needs of the Party and the country. Since this plenary session is a crucial moment for our country, the reactionaries will of course make a final struggle, and will do everything possible to create rumors and sabotage. However, the more intense the reaction is, the more we should strive. One thing everyone must recognize clearly: the success of the revolution lies in the unity and development of the revolutionary forces themselves, as well as the increase in efficiency. Now that internal and external troubles are pressing in, all loyal comrades must not be provoked and alienated by the reactionaries and suspect each other, let alone conflict with each other for interests. At the same time, everyone must do their best in their own positions to develop their abilities. By doing so, the great power of the revolution can be cultivated, and efficiency can be improved. Although the period of political tutelage is short and the work is much, it can always be completed, and the reactionaries will naturally be eliminated. Yan Xishan's remarks are absurd. On the surface, he is being polite to the country and deceiving himself, but in reality, he is using force to coerce the Central Government. Recently, he even used the names of many generals to issue telegrams, exaggerating his power. His methods are so clumsy. Now, not only are other generals unwilling to be his puppets, but even his own troops are gradually becoming alienated. Shanxi, which he considers his fundamental base, is also facing economic bankruptcy. He is at the end of his rope. Even if Mr. Yan does not consider the country as a whole, he should consider Shanxi. Even if he does not consider Shanxi, he should consider himself. If he can turn back immediately, it is not too late. As for the Central Government, in order to take care of the people's suffering, it will never lightly use force unless it is absolutely necessary. As for Mr. Yan's actions this time, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved last Saturday to specially send Committee Members Li Yuying, Zhang Ji, and Zhao Daiwen to thoroughly investigate the truth and report it.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session deliberated and resolved on various cases yesterday, the 3rd: (1) Work Guidelines for Training Party Members; (2) Promoting Party Affairs Work; (3) He Yingqin's proposal for a thrift movement; (4) Regarding construction guidelines. The original text of each case is recorded below:</p>
<p>Work Guidelines for Training Party Members</p>
<p>(I) Explanation</p>
<p>Party member training is the basic work of party departments at all levels. Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee, party departments at all levels have established special departments or sections to handle party member training. However, for the past two years, local party departments have generally emphasized superficial work in party member training, lacking practical effectiveness, resulting in repeated mistakes and frequent disputes. The errors are listed as follows: (1) Superficial understanding of doctrine, low level of knowledge, too little work experience, ignorance of obeying the public opinion of the majority and implementing party resolutions to achieve the party's overall action. Therefore, their unity is not solid; (2) Failure to understand the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s universal love, using hatred as a psychology, destruction as a goal, even following the old tricks of the Communist Party, using the people as tools for struggle; (3) Too isolated from the history of the party; (4) Unwilling to pay attention to awakening people, nor willing to learn with an open mind; (5) Too small a vision, too narrow a mind, so often focusing on trivial matters, failing to grasp the big picture, or being clear about blaming others but ignoring self-criticism, even being fond of courage and fighting, engaging in personal disputes, and neglecting all party affairs development, social progress, or even abandoning them; (6) Too high a desire for leadership, so lazy in serving, brave in seizing, willing to sacrifice the interests of the entire nation for personal gain, and even thinking that the masses can be used by them, not knowing that they themselves are being used by others; (7) Not humbly observing the actual demands of the people, not sincerely doing practical work for the people, so unable to approach the people and gain their sympathy; (8) Often paying lip service to overthrowing bad gentry and local tyrants, but being used by bad gentry and local tyrants, and also failing to understand the reasons for the formation of bad gentry and local tyrants, so becoming bad gentry and local tyrants without realizing it; (9) Not energetic, doing things too slowly, unconsciously falling into corrupt habits; (10) Not distinguishing between public and private matters, with personal feelings of discord affecting the progress of party affairs, harming the public for personal gain, and avenging private grievances under the guise of public duty.</p>
<p>(II) Measures</p>
<p>The future direction of training party members should start with spiritual education, so that party members understand their position in society and their responsibilities, cultivate their sound personality, and firmly establish their belief in doctrine, fundamentally correcting their erroneous psychology and naive actions. The following points should be given practical attention by every party member when training party members: (1) Party members must know that improving party authority lies in their sound personality, academic cultivation, and sufficient ability. If they gain the trust of the people in society, then they can lead the people to practice doctrine. If they do not work hard in practical work, but only use the slogan of improving party authority to call on the masses, it will harm the development of party affairs; (2) Party members must strive to serve the society, so that local education, economic undertakings, can develop, then the people will naturally develop faith, and the special status of bad gentry and local tyrants in politics or economics will naturally not exist; (3) Party members must take service as their purpose, not seizure as their purpose; (4) Party members are the teachers of the people and should go to schools to educate young people and to society to educate the masses; (5) Party members must pay attention to approaching the people, publicizing doctrine, and influencing people's hearts, so that the people are sincerely convinced. Their attitude must be kind, so that they can gain the sympathy and trust of the people, and the progress of party affairs work will naturally reduce obstacles; (6) Party members should feel that their own abilities are insufficient, so they will be humble, and pay attention to developing creative abilities, so they can make progress.</p>
<p>Promoting Party Affairs Work</p>
<p>(I) Explanation</p>
<p>Since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Second Central Executive Committee decided to reorganize party affairs, the work of party departments at all levels has gradually moved from being scattered and disorganized to being orderly and unified. Some local party departments have been able to adhere to the central government's intentions and abide by the central government's laws and regulations to achieve results. However, the majority has not yet been able to get on the right track. The reasons for this are that they either lack work plans and concrete plans, or they do not understand the handling procedures and implementation methods, inverting priorities and confusing steps, resulting in increasingly empty party affairs work and declining party authority. The errors are listed below: (1) Emphasizing written work but lacking practical activities; (2) Emphasizing superficial propaganda but lacking practical achievements; (3) Emphasizing formal compliance but lacking work effectiveness; (4) Lacking correct training and guidance for party members; (5) Not recognizing the boundaries between the Executive Committee and the Supervisory Committee, so their work often has the drawback of duplication; (6) Not recognizing the boundaries between the party department and the government, resulting in disputes and conflicts between the party and the government; (7) Unable to lead the people, strive for social reform, and promote political progress; (8) Responsible personnel, due to their efforts in the work of their主管 (zhuguan - in charge of) department, have neglected to liaise and coordinate with other departments, resulting in畸形 (jixing - abnormal) development, and even the work of each department itself is hindered.</p>
<p>(II) Measures</p>
<p>In the future, methods for promoting party affairs work in various places must learn from past mistakes, remedy deficiencies, so that the organization is严密 (yanmi - tight/careful), the application is灵活 (linghuo - flexible), everyone uses their talents, and everything is done. Then the people will begin to believe, the party authority can be improved, and politics and society can be reformed. Based on this meaning, the main points are drafted as follows: (1) Executive committee members and supervisory committee members of party departments at all levels must not leave their posts without authorization, and service regulations should be promulgated for compliance; (2) All higher-level party departments should轮调 (luntiao - rotate and transfer) committee members of lower-level party departments to report on the status of party affairs work and provide necessary guidance and corrections, so as to receive the effect of contact and avoid the弊 (bi - drawbacks) of隔阂 (gehe - estrangement); (3) Party departments at all levels must focus on practical work and strive to serve the people in the future, so as to reform society and promote politics; (4) The circumstances in various places are not completely the same, and the types of work and their implementation procedures will naturally not be completely the same. Higher-level party departments should酌量 (zhuoliang - consider) the current situation in various places, separately formulate plans, instruct機宜 (jiyi - important matters),督促 (dūcù - supervise) implementation. Those formulated by the party departments themselves must be submitted to the higher-level party department for approval; (5) The types of work in lower-level party departments should be simple and easy to implement, and should not be too complicated. If too many matters are started at the same time, it will inevitably lead to顾此失彼 (gùcǐshībǐ - to attend to one thing and lose another), and no results will be achieved. Therefore, higher-level party departments should統盤 (tǒngpán - comprehensively) plan and formulate concrete plans, and gradually instruct lower-level party departments to implement them according to the prescribed procedures, so as to concentrate their efforts and計日觀成 (jìrìguānchéng - to look forward to completion every day); (6) Party affairs work must be in line with its time, place, and nature. Whether it is public or secret, it must be斟酌 (zhēnzhuó - considered) according to the situation, and should not adhere to a fixed view; (7) Party affairs work should be for construction purposes and should avoid attacking individuals. Special attention should be paid to comrades; (8) The supervisory committees of provincial and county party departments must pay attention to collecting evidence for举报 (jǔbào - report) cases. Therefore, they should first implement严密 (yanmi - tight/careful) supervision and must go through慎重 (shènzhòng - careful) review. Otherwise, empty言 (yan - words)举报 (jǔbào - report) will lead to谩骂 (mànmà - abuse), not only will it not补 (bǔ - help) the facts, but it will also损落 (sǔnluò - damage) the party's credibility; (9) Party departments at all levels should pay attention to increasing practical work and should not be limited to written work; (10) Party departments at all levels should send personnel to give lectures to each other to激励 (jīlì - encourage); (11) Party departments in counties and below must pay attention to developing the spirit of party members to serve the party. The daily party affairs work should be based on the principle of委员 (wěiyuán - committee members) and所属 (suǒshǔ - affiliated) party members using their职业 (zhíyè - professional) spare time to share the work. County party departments should reduce staff, and party departments below the county level must not employ staff unless there is an异常 (yichang - unusual) need and with the permission of the higher-level party department. If the living expenses of party affairs workers are reduced and the party's activities are increased, it will be easier to develop party affairs; (12) Party departments in counties and below must pay attention to developing the spirit of party members to serve the society, so that they engage in promoting public education and assisting local自治 (zìzhì - self-government) work, so as to gain the trust of the people and improve the dignity of the party.</p>
<p>Proposal for a Thrift Movement</p>
<p>At this time of national financial difficulties and economic hardship for the people, in order to increase political and economic effectiveness, enrich the national strength, and enrich the lives of the people, Yingqin believes that it is necessary to vigorously implement a thrift movement. In addition to separately explaining the reasons and significance of the thrift movement, based on this view, I respectfully propose the following to determine whether it is feasible: (A) For the government: (1) All central and provincial schools and institutions that are not urgently needed for訓政 (xùnzhèng - political tutelage) construction should be裁併 (cáibìng - reduced and merged); (2) Central and provincial institutions should strive to eliminate redundant personnel. Anyone employed must have a certain important position and cannot虚拟 (xūnǐ - fictitious) positions, position idle曹 (cao - officials), and remain韬 (tāo - hidden) the积习 (jixi - accumulated habits) of因人设事 (yīnrénshèshì - create a position for someone); (3) The expenses required by central and provincial institutions should be重定 (chóngdìng - redefined) budgeted, striving to reduce spending on徒 (tú - vain) consumption and移作 (yizuò - transferred to) construction expenses, or used to reward and subsidize various production undertakings; (4) Governments at all levels and various institutions, regardless of who is responsible, should pay attention to the effectiveness and results of their work in fact.

<p>Proposal on Construction Guidelines</p>
<p>The revolution focuses on destruction, but especially on construction after destruction. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's (International Joint Development of Chinese Industry Plan) has shown us the way to construction. Speaking of construction, there are countless matters, and it cannot be achieved overnight. In order to seek reality and not fall into empty talk, we can only choose the most urgent needs and gradually promote them. In terms of needs, laying railways, improving water conservancy, operating industries, developing mining, and扶植 (fúzhí - supporting) agriculture and commerce are all urgent plans at the moment, and cannot be delayed. However, among them, great construction undertakings such as railways, water conservancy, shipbuilding, iron making, and steel refining should be operated by the state in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s meaning of节制资本 (jiézhìzīběn - limiting capital). If the national treasury is insufficient, it is necessary to borrow foreign capital within the scope of not hindering national sovereignty. Borrowing foreign capital for the purpose of兴利 (xìnglì - promoting benefits) is Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s advocacy, and we firmly believe that it can be implemented without弊 (bi - drawbacks). Looking around the country, the people's livelihood is declining, and哀鴻遍野 (āihóngbiànyě - cries of starving people) is everywhere. To solve倒悬 (dàoxuán - hanging upside down) to get out of水火 (shuǐhuǒ - deep trouble), there is no other way than construction. Taking Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s spirit of building the country with the party, and establishing a permanent foundation for the country, the recent construction guidelines are formulated as follows: (1) In accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s plan, pay attention to railway construction and water conservancy and electrical construction; (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s industrial plan focuses on agriculture. All development of the Northeast and Northwest and整理 (zhěnglǐ - organize) waterways are for the sake of China’s agriculture. Therefore, the party should pay special attention to the development of agriculture in the future; (1) Chinese farmers account for more than 80% of the country’s population. Therefore, the government should pay special attention to farmer education in its education方針 (fāngzhēn - guiding policy), so that agricultural production is developed and agricultural affairs are振興 (zhènxīng - promote); (1) Strive to promote agricultural cooperation; (1) Each province should establish agricultural banks within a time limit to support the development of the rural economy; (1) Coal and iron mines that have been mined with results and have no逆产 (nìchǎn - contraband) relationship should be allowed to continue mining. Those with逆产 (nìchǎn - contraband) relationship should only receive their逆股 (nìgǔ - black market share) as公私合办 (gōngsīhébàn - joint public-private venture). However, it is stipulated that the mining land is owned by the state. Within a certain number of years, the government will not take rent. After that, rent will be paid every year until a certain year when it is completely nationalized; (1) Coal, iron, oil, and copper mines that have not been developed are all operated by the state. The government may准 (zhǔn - allow) foreigners to invest or jointly establish companies within a certain range according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s International Development Industry Plan; (1) The採 (cǎi - extraction) of other special mines should be handled according to the contract signed with private individuals as stipulated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (1) China’s ordinary industry, within the scope of the government’s promoting agriculture, increasing raw materials, reducing the price of raw materials, and the government’s implementing protective tariffs, is allowed to develop freely; (1) China’s special industries, the factories that should be newly established in Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s industrial plan, are all planned and handled by the government, and foreign capital and talent can be borrowed; (1) The government should prepare within two years (1) a large-scale iron-making and steel-refining factory, (1) a shipyard, (1) an electrical machinery manufacturing factory, and foreign capital can be borrowed to establish them. (1) Party members should strive to support and promote the development of industry and agriculture, and assist the government to prohibit all illegal acts that破坏 (pòhuài - destroy) industry and agriculture.</p>
<h3>Liu Heding's Division Arrives in Quanzhou</h3>
<p>The Fujian matter will be decided after Zhang Qun returns to Beijing. A Xiamen dispatch states that the entire 56th Division has been ordered to concentrate in Quanzhou. The entire 168th Brigade, commanded by Gui Zhenyuan, arrived in the city of Quanzhou in batches starting on the 17th. The entire 167th Brigade, commanded by Liu Shangzhi, arrived in Quanzhou on the 21st, passing through Tong'an by land from Zhangzhou, and on the 22nd, they set off to Hui'an, which borders Xinghua. Division Commander Liu Heding, at 11:00 a.m. on the 21st, led the entire staff of the division headquarters, the directly subordinate special service battalion, the mortar team, the communications team, and the engineering team, more than a thousand people, and arrived in Xiamen by small steamer. After Liu landed, he visited Lin Guogeng, the naval garrison commander of Zhangzhou and Xiamen, and talked for an hour, then went to Anhai, and arrived in Quanzhou at 7:00 p.m. The followers also arrived in Quanzhou on the 22nd. The 166th Brigade, commanded by Chen Wantai, led Jiang Yan's regiment, and entered Quanzhou from Zhangzhou and Xiamen on the 22nd. Also, Chen's brigade's Tang Bangzhen's regiment arrived in Xiamen on the 22nd by two sea轮 (lún - ship)伏龙 (Fulong - Crouching Dragon) and 醒狮 (Xingshi - Awakening Lion) from Shantou, and転 (zhuǎn - turn)ed to Quanzhou by small轮 (lún - ship) on the 23rd and 24th. So the entire 56th Division has concentrated in Quanzhou. Now Liu's brigade is concentrated in Hui'an, Gui's brigade is stationed in Nan'an, and Chen's brigade is stationed in Quanzhou. It is rumored that Liu's division will continue to enter the provincial capital, but when Liu Heding passed through Xiamen, his参议 (cānyì - counselor) Zheng Naicheng代 (dài - acting) Liu to meet with reporters, and denied this, saying that the division is only ordered to集 (jí - gather)泉 (Quanzhou), and everything is according to the central government's order, and there is no continuation yet. It is heard that Liu's division's集 (jí - gather)泉 (Quanzhou) is indeed a step of the central government to solve the Fujian situation, but the method still needs to wait for Zhang Qun to return to Beijing and复命 (fùmìng - report on duty) before deciding. Zhang Qun was刺 (cì - assassinated) in the省 (sheng - province), and伤 (shang - injured) the副官 (fùguān - adjutant) Li Zhongxing. According to a dispatch from a division, the murderer's real name is Li Chengzhu. After being arrested, there are (江秀淸) characters on his汗衫 (hànshān - undershirt). Jiang is Lin Shouchang's party. The Public Security Bureau is afraid of involving many people. After the inquiry, it was not published and转送 (zhuǎnsòng - transfer)押 (yā - detain) to the Provincial Defense Command. Also, a省 (sheng - province) dispatch was received yesterday, Zhang Qun and Lu Xingbang contacted the Fujian situation, and Lu Xingbang proposed (1) The provincial committee should be解 (jiě - relieve) in two batches, the first batch is Cheng Shikui, Xu Xianshi, Zheng Baoqing and Wu Shu, and the second batch is Lin Zhiyuan and Chen Naiyuan; (2) The above six people will be sent to省垣 (shěngyuán - provincial capital) by Lu's troops (February 26).</p>
<h3>Landslide at Qingfeng West Ridge, Haizhou</h3>

The Qingfeng Ridge of Yuntai Mountain, which is the second highest peak of Yuntai, with strange rocks and beautiful scenery, also collapsed a few days ago, with a thunderous sound that lasted for a long time. Nearby樵夫 (qiáofū - woodcutter), heard the sound胆落 (dǎnluò - terrified),奔逃 (bēntáo - fled) down the mountain. After climbing the mountain to察看 (chákàn - observe), they saw a section of Qingfeng West Ridge collapsed, about a hundred丈 (zhàng - a unit of length) long, and the trees under the mountain were all覆埋 (fùmái - buried).</p>

<p>A large number of refugees are leaving the country one after another.

After proving by黄浦 (Huángpǔ - Whampoa) Alumni总会 (zǒnghuì - General Association),解 (jiě - send) it to headquarters for核办 (hébàn - verify). Ge Jianshi's case opens today. The case of Ge Jianshi and Ni Bi, former executive committee members of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, who are suspected of反动 (fǎndòng - reactionary), has been提诉 (tísù - sued) to the刑 (xíng - criminal) Court of the Jiangsu Higher Court, and it has been定 (dìng - decided) to open the審 (shěn - trial) at 1:00 p.m. tomorrow (4th).

The main points of the prosecutor's indictment are the letter from Minhun to Jianshi Ruoqu and the letter from Ge Shangde to Yao Chengwen sent by the No. 141 letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters整理 (zhěnglǐ - organize) Committee. Only the letter with the name Minhun is Chen Minhun, not He Minhun. Chen's name is Jianming,字 (zì - style name) Minhun, and he is a graduate of the first phase of the黄浦 (Huángpǔ - Whampoa) Military Academy. He is currently the propaganda section chief of the Sixth Route Headquarters.

Also, the letter from Ge Shangde to Yao Chengwen was because Wu Yucang, the former commissioner of Tai仓 (Cāng - granary)監 (jiān - supervise) Committee, was执 (zhí - detained) committee member to告 (gào - accused) the provincial party headquarters. Wu planned to反诉 (fǎnsù - counter-sue), so he told姚 (Yáo - Yao) Chengwen, the secretary of the association, to致函 (zhìhán - send a letter) Shangde, please first向 (xiàng - to)代 (dài - acting) to explain to the provincial party headquarters.

At the age of nine, he was betrothed to the daughter of Wang Mou in Beiren Village. The woman is now 19. The engagement gifts were very meager at the time. Maoshan's family was poor, so he worked as a coolie in a factory in Shanghai to make a living. Now Wang, because she has a maternal cousin Ni Mou, whose family is not well-off, suddenly had the idea of disliking poverty and loving wealth. She insisted on breaking the engagement and promised her daughter to Ni Mou. The matter was heard by her daughter, who strongly disagreed. This woman was a staunch believer in the old ethics and felt very resentful in her heart. It happened that Maoshan returned to his hometown to visit relatives the other day, and she learned of it. She then met with her fiancé and vowed to marry Chen. However, Chen could not afford to marry her. Wang then eloped to the Chen family, willing to be a daughter-in-law and working very diligently, without complaining about the hardship. Wang only learned of the matter after losing his daughter and realized that there was nothing he could do.</p>

<p>Accumulated Grain Funds Almost Entirely Transferred: The county government, considering that the Yicang Management Committee has been established, ordered that all accumulated grain under the management of the fund-raising office should be transferred to the committee to implement grain storage in accordance with the law.

Xia reported that the accumulated grain deposits, excluding those borrowed for the purchase of firearms for the Public Security Team, totaled 2,149.8 yuan in Baochang, 4,141.88 yuan in Yongcheng, 7,582.1 yuan in Chengfeng, 934.83 yuan in the general account, and 3,205.933 yuan in Changhua. Because Director Yin Qian faced difficulties in local expenses, all deposits except those in Changhua had been used to offset 3,900 yuan in Yongcheng, 8,300 yuan in Chengfeng, and 2,000 yuan in Baochang. Currently, only the deposits in Changhua can be fully transferred. The remaining funds need to be recovered by the county government.</p>

A clear report must be submitted for verification.</p>
<p>Finance Department Orders Investigation of Illegal Levies: The Changhai Tax Sub-bureau previously established a ranking team near Huangtiangang to Nanwai to address the issue of congested boats during the winter drought. Later, a conflict arose with the Ship Industry Labor Union over the collection of membership fees. The Labor Union filed a complaint with the Finance Department, which ordered the county to investigate. The other day, someone was privately collecting membership fees again and reported it to the county. County Magistrate Shen commissioned Judge Tong Cheng to investigate. Yesterday (the 2nd), they went to the County Party Headquarters. Xu Jiang was away on a trip to the province, so Xing Jiewen, the former executive committee member, took over. It was said that the Ship Labor Union's collection of membership fees was not on file. Tong went to the Beiwai Tax Office to investigate. The ranking team was registered with the Finance Department in the 12th year of the Republic of China, charging 30 cents for boats with more than 300 stones and 20 cents for boats with less than 300 stones.</p>
<p>Two cents were charged for each pig. Upon arriving at the Ship Industry Labor Union, a notice for the collection of membership fees was found on the wall. The other morning, dense gunfire was heard at Siduizai on the opposite bank. Yesterday, the police bureau investigated and learned that it was an Anqing cargo ship carrying more than ten loads of opium being thrown into the river. A bandit ship rushed to retrieve it and fired warning shots. The opium belonged to local merchants from Jiangyin and Jingjiang, and one-third was stolen. A telegram was immediately sent to Gu Mou in Zhenjiang to find a way to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Electricity Company Repeatedly Accused: The Yangzhou Zhenyang Electric Light Company was previously accused by 36 industries, including local leather and silk merchants, of illegally increasing prices. The lawsuit has been going on for nearly three years and has not been completely resolved. Recently, the company revised its business regulations, which sparked another wave of protests over unpaid fuel fees. The other day, Xie Jiren and Xu Jiechun filed another complaint with the Construction Committee and the Department of Construction, accusing the company of using purple copper wires for its power lines, disregarding departmental regulations, disregarding local safety, occupying public and private land, and filling official ditches, causing the entire city to become a swamp after heavy rains. They requested an investigation. It is now heard that the Department of Construction has copied the original complaint and ordered the original investigator, Jin Pu, to investigate the case thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Hu</h3>
<p>Village Committee Member Shot and Killed by Bandits: At about 7 p.m. on the 26th, several bandits wearing black robes suddenly broke into the home of Chen Danian, the village committee member of Miaoqian Village near Lincheng Bridge in Hu County. They shot Chen several times, hitting his vital points, and Chen died. The bandits fled upon seeing Chen dead. The Linshui police arrived after hearing the news, but the bandits were gone.</p>
<p>Water Police Recover Kidnapped Victims: At about 6 p.m. the other day, several bandits armed with wooden shell guns suddenly arrived at the home of former provincial assemblyman Zhu Dingcheng outside the West Gate of Changxing in Hu County. They kidnapped Zhu's brothers, Luoren and Da. Wang, the captain of the 11th water police team stationed in the county, immediately led one or two detachments to guard the main roads. The next afternoon, they encountered the bandits at Xiaowu Mountain. The two sides exchanged fire and fought fiercely for an hour before the bandits were defeated and fled in all directions. The police arrested Liu Chuntong, one of the bandits, and rescued the two kidnapped victims on the spot. Upon interrogation, the bandit confessed that the ringleader was Abbot Yuan, who was near the Coal Railway. Captain Wang immediately sent people to search the area based on the confession and arrested Abbot Yuan. He is now being held at the Changxing Public Security Bureau pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Strange Method for Treating Meningitis: Since meningitis was discovered in the four townships of this county, the epidemic has been spreading rapidly in recent times. Recently, someone returned from Luxu Town and reported that the town also had the disease. Later, someone invented a simple first-aid method that has saved countless lives. The method involves placing a live rooster on the patient's chest. The rooster will remain still and not eat. After a few hours, the illness will suddenly disappear. Even in extremely critical cases, it can be saved. The method seems very simple. However, some people in Xincun Town have tried the method and have also cured several people. It is not known what the principle is.</p>
<p>County Executive Committee Determined: The members of the County Party Headquarters Executive and Supervisory Committee were selected by the Fifth County Representative Assembly and submitted to the province for approval. It is now known that Zhang Tingzhi, Chen Di, Yu Kaijun, Yang Zaoshi, and Shen Pengnian have been approved as members of the County Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Xincun Town Robbed by Bandits: This morning (the 2nd) at about 4 a.m., the county government received a telegram from Siliqiao stating that Xincun Town was robbed by bandits last night and has not stopped this morning. County Magistrate Fang immediately contacted the Provincial Security Team to suppress and defend the area after receiving the telegram. The losses are said to be about tens of thousands of yuan. A special curfew has been declared in Pingdi.</p>

<h3>Hebei Earnestly Promotes Mass Education</h3>
<p>Shen Yinmo, the Director of Education of Hebei Province, has plans and methods for promoting mass education in the counties of the province and earnestly implements them. This can serve as a reference for other provinces in promoting mass education. Director Shen of the province submitted a document to the Ministry of Education stating that the promotion of mass schools is a fundamental plan for implementing mass education and is of utmost importance during this period of political tutelage. Since the resumption of duties last year, the office has vigorously promoted mass schools. In August of last year, it formulated the Hebei Province Implementation Rules for Mass Schools in accordance with the Main Points of the Mass School Regulations issued by the Ministry, taking into account the local conditions of the province, and issued a notice for implementation. In September, it formulated the Hebei Province Method for Establishing Mass Schools in Counties in Stages, dividing all counties in the province into eight levels according to population, wealth, and other differences. During the six years of political tutelage, it stipulated that each level of county should establish at least a certain number of mass schools each year. By the end of the political tutelage period, every village should have a school and everyone should be studying. At the same time, it also formulated the Hebei Province County Education Bureau Chiefs' Special Project Assessment Method for Handling Mass Schools, which were all issued for implementation. Now, the aforementioned rules and methods are being submitted to the Ministry for review and approval, in addition to being submitted separately to the Hebei Provincial Government. The Hebei Province Method for Establishing Mass Schools in Counties in Stages generally divides all counties in the province into eight levels according to the household population, wealth, and education status of each county and sets out a phased implementation plan: (1) In the 18th year, counties of level A (Luan County) should establish at least 140 mass schools, counties of level B (Fengrun and Daming) should establish 100 schools each, counties of level C (Tianjin and four other counties) should establish 70 schools each, counties of level D (Tong County and 21 other counties) should establish 60 schools each, counties of level E (Wanping and 32 other counties) should establish 50 schools each, counties of level F (Daxing and 51 other counties) should establish 40 schools each, counties of level G (17 counties) should establish 30 schools each, and counties of level H (Xinzhen) should establish 15 schools. (2) In the 19th year, counties of level A should establish 60 schools each, level B 50, level C 40, level D 30, level E 20, level F 15, level G 10, and level H 4. (3) From the 20th year onward, each county should increase the number of schools year by year according to the aforementioned proportions until the 23rd year. It is estimated that counties of level A should establish at least 440 mass schools each, counties of level B 350, counties of level C 270, counties of level D 210, counties of level E 150, counties of level F 115, counties of level G 80, and counties of level H 35. (4) The number of mass schools to be established in stages is the minimum. All those who have met or exceeded the quota should continue to proceed. The ultimate goal is to ensure that every village has a school and everyone has the opportunity to receive education. (5) Each county education bureau must formulate detailed methods for establishing mass schools in accordance with these methods and based on the actual situation of each county and submit them to the office for approval.</p>

<h3>Record of the Luxing District Education Association Standing Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Luxing District Education Association held its first standing committee meeting at Xiangdao Elementary School yesterday. Chairman Wang Zhongcan presided over the meeting. The following matters were resolved: (1) The vacancy left by Zhichang's departure will be filled by the substitute. If the substitute for the supervisory committee member is insufficient, it will be filled by a public vote at the general assembly. (2) The investigation of new and old members will be handled by the investigation group. (3) The date of the general assembly is set for 2 p.m. on March 15th at the Xinlu Municipal Rural Normal School.</p>
<h3>Municipal Rural Normal School Will Build New School Buildings</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau opened a Rural Normal School last year. Due to the haste, it was unable to build school buildings and temporarily used a portion of the buildings of the former Xinlu Municipal Jiazi Elementary School, which was inconvenient. The funds for the construction of the Rural Normal School's school buildings have been approved by the municipal government. The other day, the bureau sent Zhu Chun, together with personnel from the Public Works Bureau, to inspect the site and will soon invite bids for construction.</p>
<h3>Municipal Schools Must Register with the Social Affairs Bureau for Afforestation Seedlings</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau recently issued an order to all municipal schools, gymnasiums, school gardens, and mass education centers that, as the Afforestation Propaganda Week is approaching, municipal schools must obtain at least ten seedlings from the Social Affairs Bureau. However, each municipal school must first register with the Social Affairs Bureau the number of seedlings required and the type of seedlings that are suitable in order to facilitate verification and issuance.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's Business Report at the Sixth Municipal Congress (2)</h3>
<p>(71) Continue intelligence testing and educational testing. Individual and group intelligence tests have been completed and two reports have been printed. Educational testing is in full swing.</p>
<p>(12) Implement college entrance guidance and employment guidance. Various survey forms were printed and sent to municipal schools and private schools that have been approved for registration, ordering graduates to fill them out and submit them for statistics. A guidance committee was also organized, with the appointment of section chiefs Yang Jiachun and Jiang Hongqi and the invitation of Mr. Chen Bulei and Mr. Wang Yunwu as members to handle the guidance of students for college entrance and employment.</p>
<p>(13) Repair school buildings in stages. Many municipal school buildings have been in disrepair for years or are insufficient. Due to the city's financial constraints, each school will collect construction fees, which will be kept in a special account by the Finance Bureau and used exclusively for repairing municipal school buildings. A school building repair committee will be organized by the bureau in conjunction with the Finance and Public Works Bureaus to plan the repair work. The municipal school buildings that have been completed are Chongzheng, Chaozong, and Bide. The ones under construction are Wanzhu, Fahua District 7, District 16, and Honglu. The ones being planned are the Rural Normal School, Cangji, and Yangzheng.</p>
<p>(14) Hold the Second Joint Elementary School Sports Meet. The city's first joint elementary school sports meet was held in the 17th year. On the birthday of Premier in the 18th year, the second joint elementary school sports meet was held, lasting for three days. Sixty-six municipal schools and nine private schools participated, with 8,445 students participating. About 10,000 to several thousand visitors came to watch each day. Many prizes were donated by groups and individuals. The results were also better than the previous event.</p>
<p>(15) Organize a Curriculum Research Committee for Elementary and Secondary Schools. The curriculum for elementary and secondary schools must be adapted to local needs and environmental conditions. Therefore, staff members of the bureau and educational experts were appointed to organize a Curriculum Research Committee for Elementary and Secondary Schools to carefully study and comply with the standards issued by the Ministry. The two committees held many meetings and have agreed on the subjects, types, and time allocation for elementary schools in the city, ordering each elementary school to comply with and conduct trials for one semester. After the end of the semester, the results of the trials will be submitted for review and approval. The curriculum standards for secondary schools are being studied by subject and will be agreed upon soon.</p>
<p>(16) Reorganize the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff in Each School. The organization of the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff in each municipal and private school in the city has been inconsistent. Unless it is reorganized, it will be difficult to unify it. The bureau has formulated Provisional Regulations for the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff in Municipal Schools in Each District, Preparatory Regulations, Provisional Regulations for the Joint Association of Teachers and Staff in Private Elementary and Secondary Schools, and Preparatory Regulations. First, each teachers' association will be ordered to suspend activities, and the municipal party headquarters will jointly select preparatory committee members for the municipal school teachers' associations in each district to prepare for the reorganization. Now, most of them have been formally established.</p>
<p>(17) Handle school health matters. (1) Formulate eight articles of a student hygiene habit plan for municipal elementary schools. The Health Bureau will compile two types of simple explanations of hygiene habits, and the bureau will formulate eight articles of measures to effectively implement them. (2) In conjunction with the Health Bureau, organize school health promotion associations in municipal schools, allocate funds, and actively proceed. (3) Carry out smallpox vaccination for students in municipal schools to prevent smallpox. (4) When meningitis occurred last year and epidemic diseases were discovered in the summer, each school was ordered to hold preventive injections to avoid infection.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding social education</p>
<p>(1) Literacy Movement. Organize a Literacy Movement Committee, plan implementation methods, give speeches on the need for literacy at any time, distribute literacy movement leaflets, and install oil-painted color-through educational picture signs and enamel popular education slogan signs in the City Temple and at key intersections to promote the self-awareness of unemployed people.</p>
<p>(2) Organize a Mass Education Committee. Most Chinese people lose their education in childhood. Mass education is indeed an essential plan for popularizing education. The guiding principles of the policy direction curriculum outline should be determined to serve as a standard. Therefore, a Mass Education Committee was organized to plan the overall responsibility of mass education.</p>
<h3>Ma Junwu Refuses to Become President of China Public School</h3>

<p>Sports</p>
<h3>National Games (1) Number of Participants in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Approximately 120 athletes</p>
<p>All participate except for swimming</p>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the National Games received a letter from the Nanjing Special Municipal Education Bureau yesterday responding to the number of participants in the games. All items will be participated in except for swimming. The original letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, I recently received your association's telegram regarding the opening of the meeting. The Nanjing Special Municipality Preparatory Committee for the National Games has been formally established, and all preparatory matters are actively underway. The Nanjing Special Municipality will send approximately 120 athletes to participate in the games. According to the trophies of the sports events set by your association, all events except swimming are planned to be prepared for participation. Once the preliminary selection is completed, the registration will be submitted on time. This is a reply in advance, hoping for your review.</p>
<p>(2) Accommodation and Food Prepared Properly</p>
<p>The conference anticipates that there will be thousands of athletes participating from various regions and that the number of conference staff will also be considerable. Therefore, the conference should properly address the issue of food and beverages in advance. The logistics department has invited merchants to contract the catering and has reportedly reached an agreement. However, for the sake of caution, the department has established a contract for the cleanliness of the meals, the size of the plates and bowls, and the amount of food to prevent malpractice from occurring in the future. Regarding the issue of accommodation, the department is also making proper preparations and has ordered the three major barracks originally located behind the Dayingpan to be repaired. It is expected that they will be completed within a few days. The interior finishing and all arrangements have been handled to ensure cleanliness and hygiene as the main priority.</p>
<p>(3) Business Market Begins Construction</p>
<p>The conference is also building houses in the venue to facilitate merchants to rent and operate stores. The conference anticipates that during the conference period, the average daily attendance of participants and visitors will be tens of thousands. The development of its business can be guaranteed. However, the purpose of the conference for the shops participating in the venue is to facilitate visitors. Therefore, extremely low rental fees are charged to receive great benefits. Therefore, major companies and stores in Shanghai have been rushing to reserve rentals. However, it is heard that some merchants plan to build their own buildings. Due to the imminent start of the conference, the conference has decided to order construction to be completed within the time limit to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>(4) Soliciting Advertisements for the Handbook</p>
<p>In order to enable participating groups and people from all provinces to understand the content and the significance of the creation of the conference, the conference will issue a handbook for the National Games, which has been compiled and will be printed soon. In order to facilitate the business of major companies and merchants in each province, dozens of advertisement spaces have been specially reserved in the handbook at low prices for all walks of life to subscribe to.</p>
<p>Citywide Games</p>
<h3>Registration Deadline is 5:30 PM Tomorrow</h3>
<p>All athletes from Shanghai Special Municipality who wish to participate in the National Games must participate in the municipal games. Only those selected by the selection committee will be eligible. This was previously decided by the technical department of the organizing committee. Registration for all events will close on the 5th of this month. Any athlete aspiring to participate in the National Games must register at the Municipal Education Bureau before 5:30 PM on the 5th.

<p>Tennis: Since the start of registration, more than twenty people, including Yu Tianguang, Zheng Zhaojia, Qian Yaobin, and Qiu Zhenglun, have registered. All are outstanding players in Shanghai. However, Yan Rongsheng and Feng Jinkang, the Shanghai champions, have yet to make an appearance. It is expected that they will participate and add luster to the event. As for the women's side, there are few participants. However, Shanghai is not short of female heroes, such as Wang Dale and Su Zuqi. During the tennis season, they have gained considerable fame in every competition. In addition, Shanghai is the gathering place for national talents on the Huangpu River. There must be many hidden masters. With the registration deadline approaching on the 5th, it is hoped that they will seize the opportunity to rise up and add glory to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Basketball: Basketball is one of the most popular and interesting sports in Shanghai. Naturally, there will be differences in skill levels, which is normal. Strong male and female players from all schools and organizations in Shanghai have registered. Judging from their usual performance, the Qingguang team is the strongest. It is hoped that the East-West team, jointly formed by Yangshupu and Fanhangdu universities, will participate. Most of the players in this team are famous. Their participation will surely cause a sensation in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Proper Arrangements Have Been Made for the Fujian Affairs.</p>
<p>The Provincial Committee Members Who Went to Beijing Were Punished.</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Qun returned to Shanghai from Fujian aboard the Puan warship on the evening of the 28th of last month. Due to fog, he only arrived at Wusongkou at 12:00 PM yesterday. Accompanying him were several staff members, including Lin Yannan. Secretary Guo Shihui, who went with him, is said to be returning to Shanghai in a week due to other business. Many people from the military and political circles of Shanghai welcomed him at the dock, including government officials and adjutants from the Naval Reorganization Office. After disembarking, Zhang went straight home by car to rest. At 3:30 PM, he went to the Municipal Government to work. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed him, and Zhang spoke in detail about the Fujian affairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation Results Zhang said, "I was ordered to go to Fujian to investigate and deal with the Provincial Committee dispute, and I was determined to uphold the authority of the Central Government and resolve local disputes. After arriving in Fujian with Chairman Yang, I sent staff to Youxi to inquire about everything from Lu Xingbang and conducted detailed investigations in all aspects. Only then did I realize the crux of the problem was entirely due to suspicion and misunderstanding. The rumors that one party was resisting the Central Government were not true. Therefore, I stayed in Fujian and consulted with Chairman Yang and others, and finally, we decided on a very proper way to resolve local disputes while maintaining the authority of the Central Government. Therefore, when I left Fujian, I telegraphed the results of the investigation and the methods of handling the aftermath to the Central Government for review and implementation."</p>
<p>Provincial Committee to be Sent to Beijing The telegram to the Central Government stated that after investigation, according to Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, etc., Lin Zhiyuan and five others were suspected of being reactionary, so they were arrested. However, Lin Zhong, Sa Fuchou, Lu Xingrong, and others acted arbitrarily in the arrest, violating regulations, and should be punished. As for the arrested Provincial Committee members Lin Zhiyuan, Xu Xianshi, Chen Naiyuan, Cheng Shiyue, Zheng Baoqing, and the Director of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, Wu Shu, and five others, they should be sent to the province and then to Nanjing, where the Central Government will conduct a thorough investigation to determine whether they have reactionary tendencies and then decide on their punishment.</p>
<p>Request for Punishment Zhang also said that this was his and others' opinion. It is still unknown whether the Central Government will agree or not. Lin Zhong, commander of the Provincial Defense Army, Sa Fuchou, commander of the fortress, and Lu Xingrong, provincial committee member, knew that arbitrary arrests were wrong and requested punishment. Today (March 3rd), I received a telegram from Fujian stating that Lin Zhiyuan and other provincial committee members would be sent to the province and then to Beijing soon, so the established plan must be carried out smoothly without any problems. I received a telegram from Lin Zhong and others on the boat, stating that rumors were rife outside, but they were sincerely supporting the Central Government and had no other intentions, asking me to explain to the Central Government on their behalf. Therefore, rumors that Lu Xingbang was spying on Zhejiang were not credible. Chairman Yang will probably not come to Beijing for the time being. The reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government is a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Assassination Incident I was ordered to go to Fujian to investigate, but I had no rights to speak of, and I had no grudges against any individual in Fujian. Unfortunately, an assassination occurred after I arrived in Fujian, so it can be determined that it was a political act. Adjutant Li Zhonghang died as a result. Li had been with me for nearly five years and was very capable. It is a pity that he was killed suddenly. Li was shot in the car, but he was still able to jump out of the car and shoot at the assassins, falling to the ground after taking ten steps. The wounded assassin was shot in the left brain and was unconscious and unable to speak clearly, so there was no confession. Rumors that so-and-so was the mastermind are all speculations, not confirmed by the assassin himself. Li's coffin will be transported back to his ancestral home in Anhui by his father in a few days. Secretary Guo Shihui, who stayed in Fujian to liaise, will also return to Shanghai soon. Because the Third Plenary Session has no new proposals, I will go to Beijing after the municipal government affairs are cleared up.</p>
<p>Guo Shen's Telegram The municipal government received a telegram from Secretary Guo Shihui, who accompanied Mayor Zhang to Fujian, stating that after arriving in Fujian, he was assigned to Youxi to investigate the situation in all aspects. After the matter was completed, he returned to the province. The mayor maintained the authority of the Central Government and resolved local disputes, and drafted a plan to be submitted to the Central Government for approval. The arrested provincial committee members will be sent to the province within a few days. The mayor has already left for Shanghai. Shen will stay here for another week. (Signed) Guo Shen.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health Convened Sino-Foreign Epidemic Prevention Conference in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Many Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>Emphasis on Customs Quarantine</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:30, the Ministry of Health convened a joint Sino-foreign epidemic prevention conference at the Municipal Club on Weihaiwei Road, with the participation of health authorities from the concessions and directors and heads of various departments of the Ministry. Minister Liu Ruiheng personally came to Shanghai to attend. Many important epidemic prevention cases were resolved, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The details of the meeting are summarized below:</p>
<p>Attendees The Chinese attendees, in addition to Chairman Liu Ruiheng, included Health Director Cai Hong, Health Care Director Jin Baoshan, Director of the Central Hygiene Laboratory Chen Fangzhi, Director of the Shanghai Hygiene Laboratory Chen Jun, Director of the Hygiene Department of the Ministry of Railways Hu Xuanmin, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Hygiene Bureau Hu Hongji, and President of the Red Cross Hospital Yan Fuqing. The foreign attendees included Dr. Davis, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Bureau, Deputy Director Brijdon, Director-General of the French Concession Council Fotian Ya, and Director of the Customs Quarantine Office Ai Wuhua, and ten others.</p>
<p>Joint Epidemic Prevention Office The discussion then turned to epidemic prevention measures. It was agreed that as the weather was gradually warming up, cholera would soon be rampant. The prevention of cholera should be discussed first. It was decided that (1) a temporary joint cholera prevention office would be established by the Chinese and foreigners. The Ministry of Health would send personnel to preside over it, and the concession authorities would send representatives to participate. The first priority would be to investigate the origin of cholera and study isolation methods. Then, a unified form would be drafted. If a cholera patient was found, the doctor would report to the office using the form, and personnel would be dispatched immediately to investigate.</p>
<p>Designated Propaganda Day (2) Regarding hygiene education for cholera, emphasis should be placed on joint Sino-foreign propaganda. The poor residents on both sides of the Suzhou River in Shanghai are the source of cholera, so propaganda should start from these areas. May 15 was designated as propaganda day, and large-scale lectures and various propaganda activities would be held simultaneously in various locations.</p>
<p>Wusongkou Inspection (3) The Chinese and foreign authorities should strictly prohibit food and unclean river water, and pay special attention to preventive vaccinations for the poor. (4) An inspection station should be set up at Wusongkou to inspect various imported small boats. The Ministry of Health will allocate a certain amount of special funds each month to cover expenses.</p>
<p>Customs Quarantine Office The discussion continued until around 6:00 PM before adjourning. Minister Liu Ruiheng and Director Jin Baoshan took the train back to Beijing last night. According to a conversation with Jin Baoshan, the fundamental method of epidemic prevention is to focus on port quarantine. The Ministry of Health has decided to take over the Shanghai Customs Quarantine Office this summer.</p>
<p>After two years, the Ministry of Health will gradually take over various important ports. The Ministry is currently sending personnel to various European and American countries to conduct surveys and studies for reference. In addition, Director Yan Zhizhong of the Medical Administration Department has been sent to attend the International Health Conference held in Geneva on March 5.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Plunged Suddenly Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Drop of Nearly Thirty Taels Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>The Great Evening News reported that this morning (March 3), the highest gold price at the opening of the market still reached 514 taels. However, in less than two hours, it fell to 488 taels and five qian, a drop of nearly 30 taels compared to last Saturday. Such a dramatic change is unprecedented since Shanghai had a gold market. The exchange rate also fluctuated as a result. Even banks were at a loss. It is said that today's sharp drop in gold prices was caused by the news of a proposal by several key figures in the banking industry to levy a tax on the import of silver. However, the Ministry of Finance has not yet decided whether to adopt this proposal, because the impact of the tax on the financial market has not been thoroughly studied. It is also said that some people argue that silver is currency in China, but goods in India, so their nature is different. The taxation issue should be given special consideration. It is difficult to say whether the benefits obtained after taxation will meet today's expectations. As a result of today's drastic changes in the gold market, Japanese banks sold off in large quantities after the market opened when rumors spread, and then bought in large quantities again at the close. General import and export merchants who wanted to settle prices were mostly at a loss and did not know what to do because the market situation was unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce to Hold a Meeting to Maintain Industry</h3>
<p>Meeting Decided for Afternoon of the 6th</p>
<p>Letters Sent to Various Industries Yesterday Asking Them to Send Representatives</p>
<p>Regarding the convening of a meeting to maintain industry, the Chamber of Commerce sent letters yesterday to relevant industry groups and all executive committee members, stating that the Chamber had previously noted that domestic industries had been stagnated last year due to various influences. The current situation is precarious. The shipping, silk mills, match factories, silk weaving, cotton weaving, cigarette factories, etc. cannot sustain themselves. Industry is the lifeblood of the country, and Shanghai is the national hub. National economy and the people's livelihood are very important. If we do not seek to save it urgently, the danger that is coming is unbearable to imagine. Executive Committee Member Qiaqing of this Chamber met with President Jiang of the National Government in Beijing on February 4 to explain the pros and cons in detail and ask the government to provide relief. The President appreciated it very much.</p>
<p>He instructed us to return to Shanghai, put forward a plan, and submit it for adoption. The 37th Executive Committee Meeting of this Chamber resolved to submit the matter to the 10th Plenary Committee Meeting for discussion. It was agreed that it is the Chamber's duty to maintain industry, and we should actively plan. However, the situation of each industry is different, and the methods should also be different. The principles of this case were unanimously passed. As for the detailed methods, the Standing Committee was instructed to convene representatives of each industry to discuss and decide on them before making suggestions to the government. Therefore, the meeting will be held at 1:30 PM on Thursday, March 6, in the Chamber's Standing Committee Room to convene representatives of various industries. The chamber hopes that your organization will send one to three representatives to attend the meeting and discuss together. The future of industry and the lifeblood of the country are at stake. The Chamber hopes you will be present on time.</p>
<h3>Concession Telephone Problems</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Proposes Improvement Principles</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Council previously organized an advisory committee to improve the telephone services in the concessions and review the terms of purchase by the three companies. After several meetings, the bids submitted by the three companies varied greatly, making it difficult to adopt any of them. Therefore, the two municipal councils held a special meeting last Monday to set their own improvement principles and sent them to the China and Foreign Telephone Company, allowing the three bidders to modify their purchase terms based on those principles and then conduct further discussions. However, there are still no results. The Wenhui News reported on Friday that after the meeting this Monday, the review committee would issue its opinions. According to the municipal council officials, there was no meeting yesterday and no opinions were issued. Regarding the improvement of telephone services in the concessions, in addition to the two municipal councils deciding on principles last Monday, there have been no concrete results recently.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Election of Western Directors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Voting Continues Today</p>
<p>The Great Evening News reported that today (March 3) was the first day of the election of foreign directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After voting began at the Municipal Council at 10:00 AM, foreign voters came in an endless stream. The lunchtime was even busier. According to the vote counters, although there were no accurate statistics on the number of votes cast before 2:00 PM, it was estimated that they would continue to be cast until 3:00 PM. Voting will continue tomorrow, also until 3:00 PM. Then, the ballot boxes will be opened and the votes will be counted. If it cannot be completed that evening, it will be extended to the next morning for announcement. According to the number of votes cast in the past two days last year, there were 1,292 votes. If the number of votes this year is as enthusiastic as today, it is feared that a new record will be set.</p>

<p>Feeling of Goodwill Towards Weili De's Prohibition of Rent Increases</p>
<p>The French Concession Tenants' General Association learned that the newly appointed French Minister to China, Mr. Weili De, left his post in Persia in early March to assume his new position in China. The association noted that when Weili De previously served as the French Consul General in Shanghai, he issued a proclamation regarding the rent issue for residents in the concession, banning rent increases. As a result, the residents benefited greatly. The association specially printed a notice to welcome Weili De and distributed it to all residents in the French Concession.</p>

<h3>Compilation of Commemorative Weekly Meetings in Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters: The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters held an expanded memorial week for the late Premier yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Over 300 people attended, including representatives from the city-wide representative conference, representatives from various organizations, and staff members of the Municipal Party Headquarters. Pan Gongzhan presided, Xu Yefu served as the master of ceremonies, and Huang Xianggu and Bao Rong recorded the proceedings. After the customary rituals, Chen Dehui gave a political report, stating: "Comrades, last week, the Municipal Party Headquarters received an order from the Central Government, instructing us to hold an expanded memorial week to report on the Central Government's recent attitude and Yan Xishan's mistakes. The timing is excellent, as the city-wide representative conference just opened the day before yesterday, providing us with a perfect opportunity to hold this event. Now, let us discuss Yan Xishan's mistakes. Since Yan Xishan issued his telegram, there have been numerous and thorough condemnations from various quarters. We understand that Yan Xishan's apparent mistakes lie in the words of his telegram, such as 'Suppression of internal strife,' 'Courtesy and concession for the sake of the nation,' and 'Responsibility while out of office.' He declared his intention to resign while urging Comrade Chiang Kai-shek to resign as well. There has been much criticism regarding the point of 'courtesy and concession,' as he clearly misunderstands its meaning. We can analyze this from three aspects: (1) Only personal rights and interests can be subject to courtesy and concession, expressing humility and candor. However, the responsibility of pursuing the welfare of the masses cannot be subject to courtesy and concession. In other words, revolutionary causes and revolutionary responsibilities cannot be subject to courtesy and concession. How can the people's cause and responsibility be subject to courtesy and concession? Consider Zhuge Kongming, who, to maintain the legitimacy of the Han Dynasty, knew that Liu Adou was incapable, yet he dedicated himself to the cause, exhausting his efforts until his death, out of a sense of responsibility. Furthermore, the spirit of courtesy and concession was prevalent during the Three Dynasties, but mostly in times of peace. Based on past history and current circumstances, it is absolutely impermissible for anyone in a position of responsibility to talk about courtesy and concession. When the late Premier assumed the position of Provisional President, he relinquished power to Yuan Shikai to achieve national unity and peace. However, Yuan Shikai later plotted to usurp power, leading to internal warfare, resulting in fourteen years of chaos. The late Premier was deeply troubled by this. Now, if we were to allow anyone to talk about courtesy and concession with the foundation of the Party and the nation built upon the blood and sacrifice of all comrades and revolutionary masses, what would become of it? Those bearing the heavy responsibility of the Party and the nation absolutely cannot engage in courtesy and concession. Yan Xishan does not understand revolution and therefore makes such absurd statements. (2) His intention is actually to induce others to practice courtesy and concession, as he is surrounded by numerous strange and worthless politicians who incite him. He believes that if Comrade Chiang Kai-shek resigns, he will be embraced by others, leading to his absurd thinking. (3) His statement that he can take responsibility while out of office is factually untenable and extremely contradictory. How can one take responsibility while out of office? If one can take responsibility while out of office, then one can incite internal warfare. What responsibility do those in office bear? Yan Xishan truly lacks political common sense and revolutionary sentiment, leading to such absurd statements. If he genuinely wishes to talk about courtesy and concession, he can do so himself and resign. If he wishes to travel abroad, Feng Yuxiang is still waiting for him. Since he issued his telegram, not only has he not practiced the courtesy and concession he spoke of,</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>he continues to dream of being an emperor in Shanxi, advocating for the establishment of a Privy Council and a Council of Elders, as well as the convening of meetings of all Central Committee sessions and a general vote of Party members. His statements are naturally motivated. If he wishes to go abroad, I believe the entire nation will welcome him. Let us now discuss his absurd proposals. He advocates for convening joint meetings of all Central Committee sessions and ordering a general vote of Party members, claiming that "Party matters should be left to Party members." If he considers the Third Plenary Session to be illegitimate, why does he want to convene the Third Central Committee session? Clearly, he knows that he was not a Central Committee member in the first two sessions, and if a meeting were held, he would have no place. The Municipal Executive Committee has already issued a condemning telegram. We understand that Party members do not have individual freedom but only Party freedom. His words and actions are truly acts of betrayal against the Party, aimed at overturning the Kuomintang. We should, of course, use Party discipline to severely punish him. He claims that in the first two Central Committees, many loyal comrades were expelled without cause. By this logic, the late Premier was wrong to deal with Chen Jiongming and to expel Yang Ximin and Liu Zhenhuan.</p>
<p>Why does he have such slanderous remarks against the Party? He is an opportunist. Since the beginning of the Republic, he has been an emperor in Shanxi. He could pay homage during the Hongxian era, and his position remained unshaken as various warlords rose to power. He wants to preserve his territory and, at this juncture, intends to engage in cunning rebellion in secret. We are well aware of his behind-the-scenes manipulations. This time, he attempts to repeat his old tricks and become audacious. He not only fails to recognize the Party but also greatly underestimates it. He believes our Party is an ordinary party, and revolutionary leaders are akin to warlords. He fails to understand that our Party has principles, and revolutionary leaders are unwavering, adhering to the teachings of the late Premier, dedicating their lives and abilities to the Party. We also understand that he is currently surrounded by all counter-revolutionary elements, causing such mistakes, and attempting to divide and disrupt the Party. In summary, he is accustomed to being an emperor and simply does not understand matters outside his domain, remaining an ignorant rustic. Now is the time for the struggle between revolution and counter-revolutionary feudal forces, and the quicker we eliminate them, the sooner the welfare of the Party and the people will be realized. As for the Central Government's attitude towards Yan Xishan, it is very stern. Knowing that he has not received adequate education, cultivation, and refinement, and fundamentally misunderstands the meaning of revolution, they intend to deal with him using the same method the late Premier used to deal with Chen Jiongming, repeatedly advising him and unwilling to let him sever ties with the Party. If it comes to the point of no return, naturally, Party discipline will be applied. The Third Plenary Session has already resolved to send personnel to investigate, demonstrating that the Central Government still wishes to help him and treat him with leniency. If he does not awaken, there will be stern measures to eliminate this traitor for the people. The end."</p>

<h3>Holding of Afforestation Movement Week</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Orders County Governments to Instruct All Schools to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing an order, the Ministry of Education's Order No. 122 is now received, which states: 'According to the Executive Yuan's report, based on the proposal of Minister of Agriculture and Mining Yi Peiji, it is found that the Central Executive Committee promulgated the Measures for Grassroots Work Movement last year, listing afforestation movement as one of the seven movements. The Provisional Regulations on Tree Planting in Provinces, announced by the Ministry for the Commemoration of the Late Premier's Death by Tree Planting, also stipulate that each province should hold a tree planting ceremony and afforestation movement on March 12th each year, the anniversary of the Late Premier's death. However, the results at the beginning of implementation are not many. If it is not earnestly promoted, it is feared that it will become a mere formality over time. The anniversary of the Late Premier's death this year is approaching, and preparations for this afforestation movement should be made urgently. To expand the movement, it is proposed to designate one week, starting from March 11th, as the Afforestation Promotion Week, and to hold large-scale afforestation movements in the capital and the provincial and county governments, so as to popularize afforestation knowledge to the people of the whole country in the shortest possible time. The implementation methods are as follows: In the capital, it is proposed that the Ministry convene representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Railways, Construction Commission, and the Nanjing Special Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, Central University College of Agriculture, Jinling University Department of Agriculture and Forestry, etc., to form a temporary committee for the afforestation movement in the capital, and to deliberate on the implementation. In the provinces, counties, and cities, the provincial, county, and city governments shall be responsible for handling the matter together with the provincial, county, and city Party headquarters. The Executive Yuan is requested to report to the National Government for approval, and to issue an order to all ministries and departments, and all provincial, municipal, and county governments to respectfully comply with, so as to commemorate and value forestry policy.' This was discussed and approved at the 50th meeting of this Yuan and decided to be implemented. In addition to sending a letter to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee for forwarding, we hereby report to your government for review and approval, and to issue an order to comply with the above. We also request that you instruct us to comply." According to this, it was immediately proposed to the 61st State Council meeting of this government, and it was resolved to follow the order, and to instruct the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining to forward the information to the provincial governments and special municipal governments, and to formulate and report the afforestation plans and completion dates of the provinces and cities. In addition to issuing instructions and distributing them, this order requires the Department to respectfully comply with it. This order, etc., is hereby issued. In addition to the distribution of orders, this order is hereby issued to the County Magistrate to respectfully comply with it and instruct all schools to comply with it. This order."</p>

The Commander-in-Chief donated 20,000 yuan for relief in the two provinces, which has been notified by Wang to the Jiangsu Provisional Relief Association and the Shanghai All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association to collect and remit to the disaster areas for spring relief. The office is a branch of the national relief organization, and it has recently received numerous telegrams and letters requesting relief from various places. The disaster areas are severely affected and widespread, and public relief funds are limited. It is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to provide assistance to overcome this catastrophe. All donations from benevolent individuals, regardless of the province designated for relief, will be remitted immediately and accurately distributed.</p>
<h3>Tragic Disaster Situation in Xingping County, Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Deaths Reach 71,691</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Weidong, representative of the Shanghai Shaanxi Relief Association, recently received a telegram from the Shaanxi Disaster Relief News Agency, reporting on the tragic disaster situation in Xingping County, Shaanxi Province. The original text is as follows: Shanghai No. 6 Malu office, transferred to Committee Member Sun Longji, Nanjing Fuxieshe, Guowenshe, Peiping Ma Zhixiang. After six heavy snowfalls in Shaanxi Province, the disaster situation in each county is increasingly severe. In Xingping County, the snow is more than three feet deep. In the northern villages of the county, such as Li Village, Ce Village, Yang Village, Zhoubian Village, West Wang Village, Zhangjia Village, and over thirty other villages, each village originally had a population of one hundred or two hundred, but today each village is empty, and all houses have been demolished, leaving not a single beam or piece of wood. The southern villages of the county are at lower elevations, and there was a harvest of one or two tenths last year due to artificial irrigation. However, more than eighty out of every hundred households are currently without food. Those who can maintain a livelihood for half a month account for 15-16 percent, and only one or two out of every hundred households can maintain until the spring wheat harvest. Out of the original population of 176,685 in the entire county, the number of deaths has reached 71,691, and 3,288 households have been wiped out. Although the Relief Association has made every effort to provide assistance, there is a shortage of food and funds. The future deaths of disaster victims in the county are unimaginable.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that philanthropists at home and abroad will provide assistance.</p>

<h3>Mr. Page Gave a Speech on the Way Out of Capitalism Yesterday</h3>
<p>Continuing to Lecture at the YMCA Today</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of Mr. Page, an American expert on social issues, giving a lecture. The location was still the auditorium of the YMCA, and the topic was "The Way Out of Capitalism." Despite the heavy rain, the audience was still very enthusiastic. Xu Kesheng presided, Chen Liting translated, and Yang Bingxun took shorthand notes in the national language. The following is an excerpt of his speech: "The motive of capitalism is to greedily seek more profit and develop one's own financial power, so it can also be said to be a selfish and self-serving ideology. Its advantages are: first, raising the standard of living; second, facilitating work; and third, shortening time. These are all the advantages of capitalism. However, its drawbacks lie in: (1) making it impossible for people to enjoy equal benefits, because a few people enjoy great benefits, while the majority are still in poverty; (2) concentrating power, that is, a few people can control great power and arbitrarily monopolize economic power, so that major social undertakings are all affected by them; (3) promoting class warfare, because people are inevitably hostile to each other and hurt each other's feelings under the competitive conditions of the capitalist system, and many people fail as a result, even losing their entire fortune. But how can we avoid these drawbacks? There are now three answers: capitalists say that we already have this capitalist system, so there is no need to change it. Communists advocate using violent means to seize other people's property. Socialists advocate using peaceful methods to improve the social and economic status quo. But what methods should we use? We should now pay attention to: (1) enabling workers to organize solid groups to represent their own interests; (2) enabling workers to organize labor parties like the British Labor Party; (3) using taxation methods to reduce the risks of assets, and there are three types of taxation methods, which Sun Yat-sen also mentioned in his Principle of People's Livelihood: (A) income tax, (B) inheritance tax, and (C) property tax; (4) the state should set a minimum wage; (5) implementing social insurance: (A) sickness insurance, (B) accident insurance,</p>
<p>(C) maternity insurance, (D) old-age insurance, (E) unemployment insurance; (6) all major social production industries should be placed under state management. In short, the Chinese people should currently pay attention to two dangers of Western capitalism: (A) blindly adopting capitalism without thinking; (B) not being able to obtain the benefits of the European and American capitalist systems but instead suffering many harms. I have read Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood and admire it very much, considering it very valuable, because once the problem of people's livelihood is solved, any social problem can be solved easily. In short, we must study how to take its advantages and discard its disadvantages. This afternoon at 5:00 PM, there will be a continuation of the lecture, titled "The End of Imperialism," and all are welcome to participate."</p>

<h3>No Ships Sailed on the Shanghai-Taizhou Route Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Zhoushan steamship, which sails on the Shanghai-Taizhou line, usually departs from Shanghai every Monday.

However, the Zhoushan steamship encountered wind again yesterday and was unable to return to Shanghai on time. It was still possible to request the Dahuang Steamboat to advance its schedule again, but the Dahuang ship suddenly collided with a Wheelock Marden ship when entering the port on the morning of the 2nd. Whether or not it should be repaired is still under investigation, so it is not convenient to sail immediately. Due to these unexpected events, no ships sailed on the Shanghai-Taizhou line yesterday.</p>

<h3>Husband Chops Concubine's Lover on Yangzhou Road</h3>
<p>Wife Returns Home and Finds Another Love, Unable to Suppress Anger, Wields Knife and Attacks</p>
<p>Ye Zhiqing, from Shaoxing, because at noon on the 2nd of this month, he went to the house at No. 1107 Yangzhou Road and used a kitchen knife to wound the head of Jiang Youde, a fellow townsman, was arrested by Hua police officer No. 2269 and detective Shan Zhaoxian from the Yangshupu Police Station, who rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. Ye was arrested along with the kitchen knife and his wife, Chen, and taken to the police station for detention. The police also ordered the injured person to be taken to the hospital for treatment. Ye Zhiqing claimed at the police station that the injured person and his wife Chen had committed adultery. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Xu Jiaxi came to the Seventh Court to investigate, and the police lawyer Gan Jingxian stated the case, saying that the victim was unable to appear in court because he was in the hospital and requested a postponement. Detective Wu Bingliang testified that he was the landlord of the house, and that Ye Chen and her mother lived upstairs. The injured person Jiang Youde often came, but he did not know about the adultery between Jiang Youde and Ye Chen. He was not at home when the incident happened yesterday afternoon, and only found out later. Chen Jintai testified that Ye Chen was his younger sister. Last May, she had a quarrel with her husband Ye Zhiqing and gave birth to a child, who died a few days later. He blamed his sister for intentionally killing the child, so she returned home and refused to go back. On December 25th of last year, Ye Zhiqing came to his house to invite his sister back, but his mother refused because his family was impoverished and unable to support her. Before this incident, his mother had gone to Hangzhou to burn incense and had not returned. He did not know whether his sister had an affair with the injured person. Yesterday afternoon, he, his two brothers, and the injured person were having lunch when the defendant suddenly arrived, attacked Jiang Youde's head twice with a kitchen knife without asking any questions, and he fell to the ground. The police arrested him after being notified. Questioned, the defendant Ye Zhiqing confessed that he had been married to Chen for three years. Last May, she gave birth to a child who died soon after. Afterwards, she despised him and complained that he was poor, so she used the excuse of returning to her mother's house in Ningbo to work in a yarn factory and never returned. In August of that year, he went to his mother-in-law's house to get clothes, but his mother-in-law accused him of being a robber and reported him to the police. The police inquired about the situation and did not arrest him. Later, on February 25, he went to his father-in-law's house again, intending to take his wife to rent a house in Minhang. He was going there for some business and his wife Chen said if they were to live together it would have to be in the next life. His mother-in-law was very fierce and his father-in-law, although not outwardly disapproving, was powerless to insist. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, he went to see his wife for some reason, sneaked upstairs, and saw his wife and Jiang Youde sleeping together. They were unaware of his presence. Overcome with anger, he went downstairs to a friend's house and stole a kitchen knife, then returned and saw Jiang Youde, his wife's brothers, and his wife Chen having lunch, so he attacked Jiang Youde's head twice with the kitchen knife. Questioned, Ye Chen confessed that she was accused by the defendant for purposely killing their baby. and that she was being threatened and that was why she returned to her mother's house. Because Ye would not support her she went to work in a factory to earn wages. Because she had been sickly, Jiang had helped her by loaning her money, thus she had become lovers with him. She denied sleeping together with Jiang at 11 a.m. that morning, that the defendant's claims were completely false, and that she would return with the defendant if he could financially provide for her, and was willing to do so. Judge Xu reviewed the confessions, ordered the two defendants to be returned to detention separately, and ordered that Jiang Youde be interrogated again after he recovered from his injuries.</p>

<h3>Children Plead With Mother to Return Home</h3>

After coming to Shanghai, Zhou had an affair with a young man and had a son and a daughter with him. The young man treated her very well. Her husband had previously come to Shanghai to persuade her to return home, but she refused. Now, Gu Changfu has died of illness in the past year. Her son, Qingnian, has repeatedly sent letters asking his mother to come home, but to no avail. He came to Shanghai with his sister the other day, found his mother in a bungalow at No. 379 Guangzhao Road in Zhabei, and greeted his mother. After being separated for more than 30 years, they hugged each other and wept bitterly, urging their mother to return home with them. However, Zhou refused, saying that her lover was currently unemployed and that all the money she had saved from her work, several hundred yuan, had been used up, but he had treated her well and she also had children with him, so she could not abandon them halfway and return to her hometown with her son. Her son Qingnian was very frustrated to hear this, so he and his sister prepared to sleep in front of his mother's door that night, determined to persuade their mother to return home with them. They also asked their mother to bring her lover and younger siblings back to their hometown and provide for them as usual. Qingnian and his sister cried loudly in front of the door. The local defense corps and patrol officers, hearing about Qingnian's commendable filial piety, have already been trying to persuade his mother to return home with her son in order to reunite with the family.</p>

They then confessed that the opium was transported from their hometown to Shanghai, totaling four large packages, intending to sell them. However, one package was seized by the customs officers, leaving these three packages, which were then discovered. The station chief, considering that the case involved smuggling opium, which is prohibited, ordered that a document be prepared along with the seized evidence and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Police Investigate Firearms in Coffins</h3>

<h3>Gambling Using Magnetism</h3>

<h3>Merchant Ship Damaged by Steamer</h3>
<p>Over One Hundred Boxes of Kerosene Lost</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 3:00 PM, a Shandong vessel carrying 4,000 boxes of kerosene, intending to sail to Zhejiang province for delivery, had just sailed south of the 16th dock of the Pujiang River in the Nanshi area, when it was unexpectedly struck head-on by a certain Japanese merchant steamer. Due to the strong wind, it was impossible to avoid the collision, resulting in damage to the cargo ship's hull and the loss of</p>
<p>over one hundred boxes of kerosene. Afterwards, the ship owner reported the incident to the water police station and other authorities for record-keeping, in order to negotiate and recover the losses.</p>
<h3>Shipping Representatives Request Clear Definition of Dock Locations and Widths</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang and others, representatives of shipping businesses in Pudong and Puxi, yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Port Authority, stating that they respectfully request the clear definition of the locations and widths of public docks south of the Wanyu Dock, in order to maintain shipping operations. They stated that the Nanshi commercial district relies heavily on trade with various inland cities and towns, so the transportation of goods</p>
<p>relies mainly on ships. If there are no public docks to moor at, then goods cannot be loaded or unloaded, and the Nanshi commercial district will decline as a result. Even considering rural ships, after arriving in Shanghai, if there are no reliable docks, they must anchor far out in the river and transfer goods ashore with great difficulty and frequent danger. This cannot be ignored. They recently read in the newspaper that the entire Pudong shoreline is managed by the Authority, and is being leased to various shipping companies. There is barely any space left for the original docks in Nanshi, and the locations of the public docks have yet to be defined. Various businesses and ship associations are deeply concerned about this. They fear that shipping companies will monopolize the shoreline rights, completely blocking the existing docks, and placing the Nanshi merchants relying on inland trade and the rural ships transporting goods in an impossible situation. This is deeply concerning. Furthermore, the Wanyu Dock and the Nanhui Guildhall Dock are the most important docks along the Pudong waterfront, traditionally serving as mooring places for ships sailing between Pudong and Puxi. Other docks such as the Yongsheng Dock and the Santai Dock are also well-known shipping hubs. In order to maintain the transportation and livelihoods of millions of people along the Pudong waterfront, the representatives feel compelled to explain the situation. They jointly submit this report to the Authority, hoping that the Authority will investigate and approve the prompt definition and announcement of the locations and widths of the public docks south of the Wanyu Dock, in order to maintain shipping operations and reassure the public. They will be eternally grateful.</p>
<h3>Collision Between Dahua Steamer and Towing Barge</h3>
<p>Dahua Steamer Damaged in Collision</p>

As it sailed past the Shanghai Waterworks Plant in Yangshupu, between buoys twelve and thirteen, a towing barge belonging to the Jardine Matheson Company was turning a large steamer around. The Dahua steamer attempted to avoid it by steering towards Puxi, but the towing barge also moved towards Puxi. The two vessels were very close to each other, and could not avoid colliding. The bow of the Dahua steamer was immediately damaged. The steamer then returned to its company and reported the incident. The company has submitted a request to the customs authorities, asking them to negotiate with the Jardine Matheson Company for compensation for the damages.</p>
<h3>Cesspit in Xue Family Garden</h3>
<p>Whether to Renovate Awaiting Inspection</p>
<p>Xue Baorun, a wealthy businessman residing on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was previously reported to the French Municipal Council by the French Municipal Bureau, for having two vats in his garden emitting foul odors that were detrimental to hygiene. They requested that the vats be dismantled and replaced with Western-style cesspools. He was ordered to renovate the cesspools in a Western style. Yesterday, the deadline was reached and he was summoned again. An employee of the Municipal Bureau stated that the cesspools in the defendant's garden had still not been renovated, and that he was deliberately disobeying the order. They requested an investigation. A certain person surnamed Xue arrived on Xue Baorun's behalf, stating that after receiving the order, the defendant had completely renovated the cesspools according to the Municipal Bureau's designs, and that the original cesspools had long been filled in and could be inspected. The Chinese and Western officials stated that since both sides held differing opinions, they would await a clear inspection before further questioning.</p>
<h3>Woman Struck by Iron Hammer Dies of Her Injuries</h3>
<p>Cao Gao, a woman from Pudong, age 22, was struck in the head with an iron hammer by her fellow townsman Wang Bingqian on Dalianwan Road on the afternoon of the first of this month. Bleeding profusely, she fell to the ground and cried for help. Police officers who heard the call apprehended Wang and took him into custody at the Huishan Police Station. The injured woman was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but she died of excessive blood loss at 7:00 AM yesterday. The police station immediately summoned witnesses and took the suspect to the Provisional Court, where Judge Xu questioned him. Witnesses Gui Wu, Wu Qianmei, and others testified that they lived near the scene of the incident and were cooking lunch at the time. Hearing cries for help, they went out to see what was happening and saw a woman on the ground. The assailant was straddling her and beating her with his fists. They tried to stop him, and he fled. They helped the woman up, but her head was bleeding profusely. Fortunately, the detectives arrived and apprehended the assailant. The victim's husband, Cao Ziqing, stated that he married Gao in November of the year before last and currently lives in Chunyangli, Beikaier Road. Questioned about this, the defendant stated that Gao's mother, Zhao, had been his mistress for ten years, since Gao was only</p>
<p>twelve years old. He raised her entirely, and sent her to school as she grew older. In September of the fifteenth year of the Republic, he went to another city and separated from her mother and daughter. On the second day of the first month of last year, he returned to Shanghai from Yichang and learned that A-Quan (the deceased's name) had married, and that her mother, Zhao, was also living with her son-in-law. At the end of last year, he encountered the daughter in front of a certain cigarette factory. When he called out to her, she refused to acknowledge that he was her father. During the Lantern Festival, he encountered the daughter again at the Xia Hai Temple with her husband, Cao Ziqing, who were burning incense, and called out to her again, but she still ignored him. The day before yesterday, he encountered her again, and she still ignored him and cursed at him. Angered, he struck her with an iron hammer. Upon hearing Wang's testimony, Cao Ziqing immediately declared that the defendant's claim of burning incense at the Xia Hai Temple was entirely fabricated, and that his mother-in-law did not live with them. Judge Xu ordered the defendant to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbers in Candy Store Heist Arrested</h3>
<p>Detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau learned that Xu Wenfu (also known as Xu Gengen, nicknamed "Leather Shoe Gengen"), a local robber involved in the robbery of over 27,000 silver dollars from the Shouhe Kangji Candy Store in Xiaodongmen on January 19, 1927, was hiding at the Ziyang Inn, 32 Hankou Road. The bureau then requested assistance from the Laozha Police Station the night before last, and the chief dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Xu. He was taken to the Provisional Court yesterday, and witness Zhang Hongyuan was summoned. Zhang testified that his father, Songquan, had been the mistress of Zhu Tao's sister. The Xiaodongmen candy store robbery had been committed by his father and Zhu, among others. After the robbery, they went to his house to divide the loot, and the defendant, Leather Shoe Gengen, was also present. He witnessed them taking out guns, as many as seven of them. Last year, when the Public Security Bureau sent officers to search his house, his father was not found, so he was detained. He was recently released on bail. Xu denied the charges, claiming that he was being framed. Judge Gao ordered the defendant to be detained pending further investigation by the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Jin Bogeng Arrested for Extortion</h3>
<p>Seeing Women, He Just Wanted to Get Rich</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Wing On Textile Mill took over the Zhonghua Textile Mill in Wusong, it was renamed the Wing On Second Textile Mill. Due to a shortage of female workers, they sent female foremen Zhang Huo and He Huo from Changzhou to recruit 15 female workers. They arrived in Shanghai by train the day before yesterday and stayed at the Datong Inn on North Zhejiang Road. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the factory sent employee Pan Weizhang to the inn to pay the travel expenses. He then accompanied the female workers to the Huaxing Restaurant on Huaxing Road for lunch. At that time, Jin Bogeng from Hunan was also having lunch at the restaurant. Seeing Pan with over twenty young women, he suspected that they had come by improper means and intended to extort fifty dollars, claiming that he was a relative of Commander Chiang and was currently a detective. Pan, who was busy, did not want to argue with him and agreed to pay for the meal, but Jin refused. Pan called the police, and they took Jin to the First Precinct of the Fourth District. After hearing the story, Chief Ni determined that Jin had impersonated a government official and extorted money, and that he could not be lenient. He prepared a document to send to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Old Men Fight Over Small Amount of Money</h3>
<p>Six Jiao Causes Them to Come to Blows</p>
<p>Their Difficult Lives Are Truly Pitiable</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, two old men with white hair and beards were fighting on Yaojia Stone Bridge Road in Zhabei. Police officers from the nearby checkpoint tried to break up the fight, but they refused to stop, so they were taken to the Fourth District Headquarters. One of the men, Liu Rulin, an old man of seventy years, cowered and said, "I owe Zhang Jinbiao six jiao. I intended to pay it back, but lately I have had bad luck and have been unemployed for several years. My pockets are empty, and I have no choice but to beg for a living. I don't even have money for food. I met Zhang Jinbiao on the road, and he insisted on collecting the debt. I pleaded with him, but he refused to show mercy and beat me. Please investigate." As he spoke, tears streamed down his face, showing his misery. Zhang Jinbiao, age 55, said, "I was asking him for money, but I didn't mean to force him. It's just that I am also down on my luck and have been hungry for days. In a moment of anger, I punched him a few times. Please forgive me." The chief ruled that the two old men were arguing over a small amount of money, which was truly pitiable. He ordered them to reconcile outside, but since Zhang had used violence and violated police regulations, he was fined two dollars as a warning.</p>

<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government Report (III) (Republic of China Year 18) 7. On Sanitary Administration Matters Sanitary administration is extremely important, as it concerns the health and well-being of citizens. The work carried out in the past year can be summarized as follows: (1) Expanding sanitary services: to promote the development of rural sanitation, a model sanitary district has been established in the Wusong District of Puxi and the Gaoqiao District of Pudong. The intention is to gradually implement this in other districts. To promote the development of physical education, school health services were created. By the end of the eighteenth year of the Republic, a total of 10,894 students had received medical treatment, 8,638 students had undergone health examinations, 1,115 students had their dental diseases treated, and 1,563 students had their minor eye diseases treated. To promote the prosperity of medicine, public hospitals were improved, mobile clinics were established, registration of public and private hospitals and physicians and pharmacists continued, and two sanitary campaigns were held in May and December of the previous year to spread sanitary knowledge among citizens. (2) Preventing the spread of epidemics: free smallpox vaccinations were administered. In the eighteenth year, a total of 129,978 people were vaccinated. Free cholera vaccinations were administered. In the eighteenth year, a total of 131,173 people were vaccinated. The names, origins, transmission, main symptoms, treatments, and preventive measures for important seasonal diseases were compiled into concise tables and distributed for posting to broaden public awareness. (3) Rectifying sanitation matters: the cleanliness of city streets is crucial for sanitation. Regulations for rectifying sanitation were established. The Sanitary Bureau hired 503 street sweepers and 18 sanitary inspectors, along with 8 managers, to manage different areas and be responsible for sweeping. All garbage dumps and landfill areas were covered with coal ash to prevent pollution. (4) Conducting livestock inspections: The meat of pigs, sheep, and cattle is essential for the daily consumption of citizens. If meat from livestock with epidemic diseases is sold under false pretenses, it can easily cause illness. Therefore, inspecting livestock for epidemic diseases is an important task of municipal sanitary work. In the previous year, regulations for inspecting livestock for slaughter were revised to ensure compliance. Pig slaughter inspections were originally carried out in Nanshi and Zhabei. Now, they have been extended to Jiangwan, Zhenru, Wusong, Pusong, Fahua, and Yangjing districts. By the end of the eighteenth year, a total of 1,015,436 pigs were inspected, and 7,259 diseased pigs were found to be unfit for consumption. Inspections for slaughtered and sold cattle and sheep began in October of the eighteenth year. A total of 15,219 cattle were inspected, and 110 diseased cattle were found. A total of 14,043 sheep were inspected, and 13 diseased sheep were found. 8. On Educational Administration Matters Education is fundamental to the establishment of a nation. The city has a dense population and thriving commerce and industry. School education and social education both need to be actively promoted. The work carried out in the past year can be summarized as follows: (1) Regarding school education: implement the Three Principles of the People education, prepare for compulsory education in phases, establish kindergartens in different districts, establish experimental primary schools, reorganize private schools, improve private universities, organize summer research institutes for teachers and staff, educational research associations, and travel and tour groups, organize Boy Scouts, survey school-age children in the city, register primary school teachers, continue intelligence tests and educational tests, implement college counseling, repair school buildings in phases, hold the Second Primary School Joint Sports Meet, organize a curriculum research committee for primary and secondary schools, reorganize the joint associations of teachers and staff of various schools, and handle school health matters.

<p>9. On Public Utilities Matters Public utilities such as water supply, electricity, and land and water transportation are essential to national civilization and the well-being of the people, and are also the foundation of municipal construction. The work carried out in the past year can be summarized as follows: (1) Regarding water supply: facilitate the laying of 18,780 feet of 18-inch diameter large water pipes in the new western district; facilitate the connection of running water to Jiangwan; resolve the issue of silk factories in the Rihui Port area paying fees to connect to water pipes; facilitate the connection of water pipes to Tanziwan; supervise the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to lay pipes and connect Yinxiang; conduct water supply registration; supervise inland water companies to improve water plant equipment; revise the third water pipe contract of the French Concession Water Plant and sign the fourth water pipe contract, and comply with the municipal government's order contract (detailed in the "Compilation of Sino-French Water and Electricity Negotiations," original book attached); prohibit residents in the Chinese-concession boundary from arbitrarily connecting to the Concession's running water; facilitate the connection of water pipes between Chinese and foreign water plants in the city; and coordinate water outages.

<p>The above nine points highlight the most prominent ones. As for this year's policy directions,</p>
<p>we must恪遵 the teachings of the Premier, uphold the guidance of the National Government and the Party Headquarters, and strive to implement the construction work during the tutelage period. To complete the plan for Greater Shanghai, we must actively construct the city center area and build the city's main roads. To improve finance, we must reduce the burden on citizens by increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. To reorganize land, we must continue to rush to conduct land surveys and implement equal land rights. To develop the social economy, we must support industry and commerce, protect tenant farmers, and improve the lives of workers. To consolidate local security, we must actively strengthen preparedness and improve police standards. To improve the health of citizens, we must improve sanitary services and carry out cleanliness campaigns. To popularize education, we must focus on compulsory education and expand public schools. To benefit the citizens, we must reorganize water, electricity, and other public utilities. It is hoped that the Party Headquarters will provide guidance and lead the citizens to cooperate to improve the municipality day by day. This is our greatest hope. (End)</p>

<h3>Mr. Tang Weizhi's Love of Daytime Naps</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Weizhi (Wenzhi), a famous figure in academic circles, is a scholar of Chinese studies. He is from Taicang, Jiangsu. He now lives in seclusion in Xiyi, devoting himself to reading and running schools. The Wuxi National Studies College he runs has achieved excellent results and has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval. It is the only excellent school for researchers of national studies. Without Mr. Tang's painstaking management, how could it have reached this point?</p>
<p>Mr. Tang resides in Xixi, Xiyi, with beautiful and serene scenery. There are bamboo groves, large vegetable gardens, and ponds. Birds soar above, and fish swim below. Mr. Tang strolls through it, indulging in relaxation and detachment from the world. This is enough to delight him. Mr. Tang is over sixty years old, yet he is majestic in stature and vigorous in spirit, which is due to his dwelling outside the material world.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang has an extraordinary memory and has extensively studied old texts. He can recite ancient books, possessing a vast knowledge. He also loves daytime naps. Two hours after noon is Mr. Tang's nap time, a habit he never interrupts. Wancheng once worked at the college and was close to him, so he knows this well.</p>
<p>In the Spring and Autumn period, Zai Yu, also known as Zai Wo, a disciple of Confucius from Lu, also liked to sleep during the day (see the Analects). In the Eastern Han Dynasty, Bian Shao, courtesy name Xiaoxian, from Junyi (now northwest of Kaifeng County, Henan), was famous for his literature and quick wit, able to compose poems on the spot and known as the "walking library." He also liked to sleep during the day (see the Book of the Later Han). Therefore, Mr. Tang can be said to be Zai Yu of ancient times and Bian Xiaoxian of modern times.</p>
<h3>Impressed Fingerprints in Mud</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>In the town, there was an old man named Gu who practiced the art of picking locks, and his skills were particularly ingenious, so he was never caught. Old Man Gu's hands both had special marks, with an extra little finger next to the thumb, commonly known as six fingers. On the 17th of this month, a Mr. Wu's house in Zhendong suddenly reported a theft. Upon inspection, the stolen items were all of ordinary value, such as copper vegetable knives. However, a pair of mud fingerprints were found on the kitchen wall, clearly showing twelve fingers. It was known to be the work of Old Man Gu, so it was reported to the Public Security Bureau, requesting his arrest. Police officers went to Old Man Gu's house, and Gu was still sleeping soundly. He was dragged out and taken to the bureau, where he was interrogated. Old Man Gu vehemently denied it, saying he hadn't done this for several years and would never leave his fingerprints to arouse suspicion, indicating that someone else had framed him. The bureau chief asked if there were any clues, but for the time being, he was detained in the detention center. Old Man Gu had a daughter who was already twenty-nine years old and engaged to a Mr. Lu from the same town, with plans to marry at the end of this year. After the old man was detained, Mr. Lu felt greatly unfair and ran around seeking help, asking people to speak on their behalf and going to the victim, Mr. Wu, to intercede for his future father-in-law. The old man's daughter also brought copper vegetable knives and other items, returning them to Mr. Wu, saying they were found in her father's room. Mr. Wu, moved by the plea of the engaged couple, felt pity and voluntarily withdrew the charges, releasing the old man. After Old Man Gu was released, he felt exceptionally grateful to Ms. Lu and greatly resented the thief who framed him. The day before yesterday (26th), Old Man Gu agreed to Ms. Lu's request to marry her to Mr. Lu earlier. The next day, his daughter finally told him that the theft from Mr. Wu was done by her fiancé, Mr. Lu. After Mr. Lu became engaged to Old Man Gu's daughter, he became very close and eager to marry. Seeing that Old Man Gu was stubborn and insisted on waiting until the end of the year, he secretly discussed it with Old Man Gu's daughter, plotting this to feign a diligent rescue effort and advance the wedding date. Old Man Gu was shocked and furious upon hearing this, but the rice was already cooked, and there was no turning back. He scolded his daughter and son-in-law a few times and let it go.</p>
<h3>Tan Ma Fulu's New Film</h3>
<p>— Chongliang</p>
<p>In recent times, talent in the Jingju opera has been most prevalent in the Sheng and Dan roles, as they can cater to current tastes and easily achieve fame. The Jing roles of Shouchen, Shaoshan, and Xirui compete in the north and south, showing a tendency to solely support the giant building and confront the Sheng and Dan. The Chou roles of Changlin, Changhua, Fulu, and Fuhui are also catching up quickly, not willing to lag behind. Their magic power to attract viewers may not be below Hao Jin. It is a pity that Changlin is declining and does not have the vibrant spirit of the past. Fuhui is also a bit young. From now on, the masters and apprentices Changhua and Fulu will be allowed to dominate. Xiao Ma's elegant voice has been gradually accumulated in records, especially Ma's majestic voice and good singing, which is the most popular. A few days ago, I purchased his new records, "Broken Arm Tax Certificate," "Sweeping the Floor and Hanging Pictures," and "Little Shepherd Boy," recorded by Great China, from Desheng Company, which I found quite satisfactory. According to the old woman in "Broken Arm," Luo Fushan is the most stable. Fulu has also worked on this for a long time. The four sentences of the Second Huang Yuanban have a mellow taste, directly surpassing Li Dakui's Woyunjushi. The section of spoken lines is very realistic, which cannot be compared to the current old women who can sing but are not good at acting. The singing in "Sweeping the Floor and Hanging Pictures" follows the Jing role, and it is indeed loud and grand, especially the tune of "Knocking my head to thank Hong'en" is the best. The "Little Shepherd Boy" piece returns to its role as a clown, assisted by Yu Lianxian, a graduate of the Fuliangcheng class, who complements each other. In short, Fulu has a good natural throat, coupled with a clever and intelligent talent, so he can have this talent and artistry. Later clown roles should be regarded as giants.</p>
<h3>Record of Gourd Fortune Telling</h3>
<p>— Huo</p>
<p>My respectful friend Yan Fusun has long been famous for his literary and artistic achievements, and his gourd calligraphy is especially infused with his heart and soul. Since the Gourd Fortune Telling Center moved to its new location west of the Tianchan Stage, its reputation has grown even more. Yesterday, my relative, Mr. Hu, mentioned Mr. Yan's calligraphy and art, sharing several things that are magical and worth recording. This briefly gives a glimpse.</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Zhou Wuai, has been an amateur opera enthusiast for many years. A few weeks ago, he was about to go to the capital for a New Year's performance. Nearing the time, he suddenly felt very nervous, fearing he would miss the performance. He shook the two characters (戔勺) in Mr. Yan's gourd. Yan judged, "There is no water beside 戔, so this trip will surely be stranded. And the character 勺 lacks gold, so fishing will not be successful." Zhou was greatly surprised by the judgment, saying, "The play I am practicing is 'Fishing for a Golden Turtle'. I did not expect the gourd's twin pearls to have foresight."</p>
<p>Yu Baiji of Nanshi will contract a construction project in the capital, hoping for its success. Suddenly, an obstacle arose. He rushed to ask for guidance, shaking out the two pearls (其區). Yan immediately judged, ""其" is a foundation without soil, and the fundamental foundation has not been consolidated. The shape of the character "區" is also of a broken gold pot. What is missing on the right is a piece of tile. Without even one tile left, it will eventually fall apart.” Yu carefully examined the meaning of the words and knew that there was no hope. Shortly after the bidding opened, he was indeed not selected.</p>
<p>Friend A and Friend B are in a love rivalry, further alienated by misunderstandings. A went to ask for guidance, shaking the two characters (吳兼). Yan said, "Try to interpret (吳), it means that without a woman, there is no pleasure for the gentleman. Furthermore,"(兼) it is better to be humble in one word. Be humble and give in, otherwise (言) plus (吳) becomes a mistake. (女) plus (兼) becomes a suspicion. If a woman accumulates suspicion and plots treachery from within, the misunderstanding will become even greater and more difficult to resolve." A, upon hearing the judgment, suddenly realized and gave up love, becoming as friendly as before with B. A staff member of Fengshenghang, Mr. Hu, gambled and lost heavily, misappropriating public funds. The business owner was about to file a lawsuit and pursue him. Hu's family, fearing this, went to consult the gourd, shaking the two characters (宛兌). Yan said, (宛) is a sign that the rice bowl has been broken. Although someone has been asked to plead, but with (兌) pushing, there is no word to the mouth. I am afraid that there is nothing to say in the end. As a result, Hu was indeed dismissed.</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Wang, owed his uncle some private debts. However, the amount was not large, and since he was an elder, he was embarrassed to ask for it repeatedly. When he casually asked about it, he was reprimanded. Recently, he shook out the two characters (歐訴). Yan smiled and said, "There is no need to ask for it, it is a waste of words. Because (歐) clearly states that it is a trivial debt, and (訴) clearly shows that one request leads to a reprimand. The meaning of the words is clearly revealed, and the opportunity is known without pondering." Wang sighed with admiration.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Snippets</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>When riding the tram and it is crowded, you must hold the rattan ring with your left hand and insert your right hand into your pocket. Then, no matter how cunning the pickpocket is, they will not be able to do anything to you.</p>
<p>When renting a house, first check whether there is a brass plate at the door and how the living room is furnished. If there is no brass plate and the living room is messy and disorderly, this kind of sub-landlord cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>Encephalitis is rampant again these days. This disease is most easily spread, especially in public places. To prevent it, you can sprinkle some perfume on your handkerchief and cover your mouth and nose with it while walking, which can avoid danger. It is best to go less often to bathhouses, hotels, restaurants, teahouses, wine shops, and theaters.</p>
<p>When smoking, do not use red-tipped matches, because the phosphorus poison in red-tipped matches is several times higher than in black-tipped matches. It is very dangerous to smoke with them.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of a Tour to America by Zhui Yu Xuan (2)</h3>
<p>— Seattle Correspondence</p>
<p>The next day, the overseas Chinese, Jin Ti, hosted a welcome banquet at the Maden Hotel. Acting Consul Liu gave a welcoming speech, with over a hundred guests in attendance. In his speech, he especially praised Wan Hua for promoting the arts, calling it a new record for an art troupe traveling abroad to the United States. That evening, they attended a welcome dinner hosted by the Sino-American Association of Seattle, with participants from over twenty organizations, such as the local Chamber of Commerce, Board of Education, Art Association, City Council, and Railway Bureau, totaling over three hundred seats. After the chairman's speech, Chinese Consul Liu delivered a speech stating that the arrival of a Chinese art troupe in the United States was an unprecedented event. He praised Mei Jun's leadership in leading the troupe across the ocean to promote the arts, stating that their ambition was great, their spirit</p>
<p>resolute, and truly commendable and admirable. He also expressed his delight in participating in such a grand welcome from the American side, for which he also expressed gratitude. Next, Professor Kang Wei of the University of Washington (Professor Kang is a professor of history and Chinese drama at the University of Washington) spoke about the history and advantages of Chinese drama. His knowledge was profound and meticulous, which was truly commendable. In conclusion, he stated that they had heard about Mei Jun's arrival in the United States for many years, and were fortunate to finally see him in person and receive his guidance. This was a great opportunity for those who study Eastern art and drama. He further stated that Mei Jun was not only skilled in performing Chinese dramas, but also able to improve ancient Chinese dramas, bringing them back to the stage, and creating many exquisite and elegant works. This has raised the status of the dramatic arts. Mei Jun possesses such outstanding ideas and talent that he is not only a famous Chinese dramatist, but also deserves to be regarded as the only dramatist in the world. His arrival should not be viewed through the eyes of an ordinary theater troupe, but as an effort to promote Eastern culture and art. How should we express our welcome and gratitude? Next, the president of the local court delivered a speech, quoting a Western philosopher, saying that a person who can use unique art to provide appreciation for the world is truly the happiest person in the world, but it is difficult to achieve. Now that Mei Jun has come to the United States, it has truly been achieved. How fortunate are we, how fortunate is America, to encounter such a rare event in the world? Subsequently, Wan Hua rose to give a response, which was tactful and appropriate. After the speech, the whole place erupted in thunderous applause, and the event dispersed late at night.</p>
<p>On the second day, the Sino-American Progressive Association welcomed the entire troupe to tour the city and invited them to visit the University of Washington. At noon, they attended a tea party hosted by the Chinese students of the university. They all stated that Mei Jun's trip would bring honor to our country and that they would provide all possible assistance. In the evening, they attended an appointment at the local Fifth Avenue Theater. The theater was constructed purely in the Chinese architectural style and was completed two years ago. A portrait of Wan Hua hangs in the main hall, which was requested and sent by the former American Consul in Shanghai before the theater's opening. When Wan Hua arrived, the general manager of the theater respectfully greeted him at the door, personally presenting him with a bouquet of fresh flowers and leading him into the theater. During the performance, someone on stage announced (We are honored to have Mr. Mei Lanfang, a great art promoter from China, visiting us.) to express their welcome. The audience applauded loudly. As the curtain was about to fall, the leading actor of the play also said that Mei Jun was now sitting in the front flower building. Why not focus the lights on him so that the guests could meet each other? Then the lights were turned on brightly, focusing on Wan Hua. Wan stood up and bowed in response, and the audience applauded again and again. Many people came from New York to welcome Wan Hua. Local reporters also came to interview him. As a result, he stayed in Seattle for another day before taking the specially prepared car of the Great Northern Railway east. The send-off was crowded, and they waved their handkerchiefs in farewell as the train whistle sounded and headed towards New York.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (140)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: The Celebrated Gentlemen Create Laughter with Hide-and-Seek; The Charming Lady Protects with Abandon. In Ruiyun's heart... she thought that winning a big hand meant a complete victory for herself. Therefore, she developed a habit of showing off her cleverness. As a result, she was always the one winning at mahjong. This was called "eating three" and also "the Two-Two Immortals Returning to the Cave." Ruiyun often used a challenging tone, either at the table or when Shichen went to her place for tea gatherings, saying, "Dare you come again tonight? Are you not afraid of losing more?" Shichen replied, "Of course I'll come. How can I lose to a little kid? I'm definitely coming to get my money back today." Ruiyun said, "Okay, I'll wait for you. Come and get your money back. Bring more money. Wait until you win before talking big." This was Ruiyun's moment of triumphant pride, holding onto her strong confidence, like those warlords in recent times who have won a few battles and think that no one can defeat them, becoming arrogant. However, her mahjong playing was indeed improving. First, she had sharp eyes and quick hands. Sometimes, before others could even discard their tiles, she would say "Faster, faster!" while already drawing a tile from the dealer's pile. Shichen said, "Watching Little Zhang is no use." Ruiyun said, "Who's watching Little Zhang? I never want the tiles discarded by the previous player anyway." In the end, Ruiyun won again. She said triumphantly, "How about it? Did you lose to a little kid again today? Can't an adult win against a little kid?" When it came time to settle the accounts, Hanyun, though she lost, was secretly helping Shichen. When A Jin lost, Ruiyun often didn't ask her to pay, saying it was okay to owe it. "I can deduct it when I lose in the future." Hearing this, A Jin honestly didn't pay. Only Shichen's losses had to be paid. Although the amount was small, they usually played mahjong with a twenty-cent base. Sometimes, they even reduced the stakes to a thousand copper coins. In short, the money Shichen paid was like spoils of war or captured weapons. The next day, she would host guests, inviting people in the room for refreshments, saying it was money won from Second Master Zuo, declaring her victory. But as things went on, it gradually became a habit. If Zuo Shichen didn't come for three days, she would try to call him. Sometimes, with the playful expression of a child, she would say, "I'm out of pocket money these past two days. I have to win some money to use." Shichen also knew that playing mahjong with her was just like giving her money. Fortunately, it was beneficial without being costly. What he liked to see most was Ruiyun winning a big hand. Sometimes, in so-called joyful flips, when a three-flip hand was won, she would often jump up, lean her body on Shichen, or hook her arm around his neck to express her joy. Shichen, however, would just stand there blankly, forgetting all about mahjong, the win or loss, as if his eyes were covered by a mist, only vaguely aware of her charming manner, her clever smile, wavering and unable to control himself.</p>

<h3>February Interest Rate at Two Taels</h3>
<p>Since the Qian industry has switched to using the Gregorian calendar from February of this year, the proposed interest rate matters are also calculated according to the Gregorian calendar. It was decided at yesterday's regular meeting that the February interest rate would be two taels and ninety-five deductions, and the outstanding interest must be increased by five taels according to the seat price (according to the seat price floor in the previous year, which was only four and a half taels, it will be calculated according to five taels from May of this year), so the highest outstanding interest will be eleven taels.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices, After Days of Unprecedented Wild Increases, Yesterday Experienced an Unprecedented Reversal</h3>
<p>▲ Rumor That the National Government Intends to Levy a Tax on the Import of Raw Silver</p>
<p>Businesses are Selling Off Massively, Finding Themselves in Dire Straits. Yesterday, the third day (Monday), the Gold Exchange operated as usual. However, the gold price situation has recently been exceptionally volatile. Unexpectedly, a drastic reversal occurred yesterday. The dangerous waves suddenly broke the 500 tael mark, causing a sharp drop. The reason for the crash was said to be the National Government's intention to levy an import tax on raw silver, and the unstable international political situation created a negative atmosphere. The sentiment among traders suddenly weakened, and the price plummeted by more than 30 taels, an unprecedented situation. Businesses engaged in massive selling. However, Wansheng and Shunli took the opportunity to buy in, while Hengxing, Shengda, Zhifengyong, Yuda, Fuxingyong, and others tended to sell. In general, the bulls were hit hard, suffering heavy losses. However, the price fluctuated sharply and was difficult to predict. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets was as much as 25 taels, and the foreign exchange rate also showed signs of weakness. Trading in the market was not particularly active. Although the morning market was narrow, it opened lower. Subsequently, the waves were very high, and the price once fell below 490 taels. However, due to the bullish sentiment of the Dalian group, it suddenly turned gentle and rose by 10 taels. The afternoon also saw a high-low range of about 10 taels. At first, it was stable, then it fell by about 10 taels, and then returned to a peaceful state. After that, it was more than 495 taels. According to a telegram from London on the 2nd, the near and far term prices were reduced by 125 again, the silver price was reduced by 3/8, and the exchange rate remained unchanged. In the morning market, the wind was crazy and the waves were dangerous, reaching a difference of 25 taels. The opening price for April gold was 511 taels and 5 cents, a decrease of 6 taels and 4 cents compared to last Saturday. The gross price fluctuated by several taels, falling from 14 taels to 7.5 cents. When the Prime Minister's order was announced, the posted price remained unchanged, at 509 taels and 2 cents, then 10 taels. Internally, it was wide. This month, British gold was sold by Dongya at 11 pence, Deutsche Bank bought it at 11 pence and 0.0625, Maihang offered May US gold at $46.875. Later, Sumitomo bought April British gold at 11 pence 4375. Then, Hengxing, Shengda, and speculators tended to sell, and various parties sold off, so the price plummeted, the decline was fierce, and it tragically fell by more than 21 taels, to 488 and a half taels at 10:30. However, the foreign exchange market at this time was particularly unstable. In an instant, Wanxing bravely bought in, and suddenly jumped up 10 taels, to 90 and a half taels at 11:15. Afterwards, there were two or three taels of rotation, and then it suddenly dropped by 4 taels, to 95 and a half taels. At noon, it closed at 497 taels and 5 cents. In the afternoon, the Guangdong group continued to dump, and the closing price fell by 22 taels and 4 cents. The afternoon market opened at 499 taels, then added 1 and a half taels, which was active buying. Afterwards, the Guangdong group and Zhifengyong still tended to sell, and the foreign exchange rate was also weak. May British gold could be settled at 11 pence and 5. June was bought by Banque de l'Indochine and Shanghai at 11 pence 6875. Also, June US gold was offered by the United Transportation Company at $47.875. Therefore, people's hearts were downstream, dropping 8 or 9 taels at once, and finally falling to 89 and a half taels. Yesterday, it was added by more than 3 taels, but there was no actual corresponding transaction in the exchange market. The market situation was chaotic. After 3 o'clock, it fell by 1 or 2 taels, but there was a high-low of 1 or 2 taels from time to time, and people's hearts were very disturbed. At 3:30, it was 91 and a half taels. After entering, it gradually rose, and the buyers were not idle. After 4 o'clock, it reached 96 taels, 3 or 4 cents. Before long, it suddenly dropped by 2 taels, to 94 and a half taels. As for the near-term British gold, it was settled at 11 pence 375, Japanese gold at 1 tael and 3 cents 5. At 4:30, the market closed at 495 taels and 5 cents, a decrease of 22 taels and 4 cents compared to March 1st.</p>
<p>The Quoted Price Dropped by More Than 30 Taels. It was found that the maximum price in one day was 514 taels, and the minimum price was 488 and a half taels, a difference of 25 and a half taels. The quoted price was still 527 taels and 4 cents, but it had dropped by 18 taels, more than 30 taels. The booked price was 97 taels to 98 taels, and the make-up water was 97 taels. In the afternoon, the quoted price dropped by as much as 32 taels, and the make-up water was 95 taels. The opening price for goods in the morning was 511 and a half taels, and the afternoon closing price was 96 taels. In the afternoon, it was 96 taels. At the closing price of 95 taels, the jewelry gold had been reduced by 3 yuan, which was converted to 70 yuan.</p>
<p>The Dalian Group Covered 20,000 Bars. The Transactions of Various Companies Were Mostly Sales. Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Tian, Taixing, Bingxing, Fuchang, Yongchang, Yuda, etc., all sold. Hengxing sold more than 4,000 bars, Yuantai and Fuyu also sold, while Wanxing and Shunli bought more than 10,000 bars. In addition, most of the retail investors bought in. The Dalian gang bought 12,000 to 13,000 bars to cover the previous shorts. A certain speculator also sold, and the Guangdong gang massively sold the bulls. In the afternoon, the transactions between traders showed that Hengxing, Shengda, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, etc. continued to sell, Dadacheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yichang, and Yuda had varying degrees of inflows and outflows, and Shunli and Wanxing bought another 6,000 to 7,000 bars. The rest were scattered retail purchases and sales, and the demand was erratic. The Dalian gang continued to buy heavily with more than 7,000 bars, while the number of sellers was very small. The number of swap bars was uneven.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Domestic Market Greatly Loosened</h3>
<p>Sterling Extended by One Penny</p>
<p>US Dollar Extended by $2.0625</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange Rate Fell by 4.875 Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and there was no telegraphic transfer from the Major Banks as usual. However, the telegraphic transfer rates from the previous day were also seen to have fallen. As for the HSBC foreign exchange rates, the prices posted yesterday morning were no different from those after the revisions on the previous Saturday. The overseas telegraphic transfer market saw Indian exchange rates suddenly extend by 3 Rupees and 4375 to 52 Rupees and 5625. Also, there was generally no decline in Yokohama and Kobe. The domestic foreign exchange rates in this city tended to loosen, which was actually a reversal after repeated tightening. Furthermore, gold prices suddenly experienced a sharp drop, which was a truly unprecedented and bizarre scene that has fallen by a huge margin of over 20 taels. Due to the associated impact of the exchange market, only a small number of Chinese merchants, speculators, and gold traders were involved. Because the change in gold prices was so drastic, they did not dare to act lightly. The transaction of the Japanese exchange rate was particularly sluggish. Chinese merchants sold more than 100,000 pounds of sterling, and banks such as Sumitomo, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, Dongya, and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank all absorbed it and also settled 40,000 to 50,000 pounds. It was sold by McGregor, Mitsui, China 比利时, and Xingye. Banks made tens of thousands of pounds of mutual trades, and also sold more than 100,000 US dollars. It was also settled for more than 100,000 US dollars, which was sold by Maihang and United Transportation to Dongya and Shanghai. However, only 100,000 to 200,000 dollars were transacted between peers in the Japanese exchange rate. This was truly due to the unsuitable hedging. By the close of the market, comparing the exchange rates with the previous Saturday, sterling extended by one penny, the US dollar extended by $2.0625, and the Japanese exchange rate sharply fell by a huge margin of 4.875 cents. The changes in the market situation were truly difficult to speculate.</p>
<h3>Major Banks' Forward Rates Fell by 19 Pence</h3>

The market situation was still flat. A telegram from New York also reported that the US silver price also fell by 375, to 40 and a half cents. The exchange rate between British and US dollars was unchanged, remaining at $4.859375. The Japanese-US dollar exchange rate also did not rise or fall, remaining at 49.25 dollars.

The bid-ask price for the British-Japanese exchange rate was the same, totaling 2 shillings 028125 to 3125. The market did not change at 11 o'clock and in the afternoon, and there were generally no rises or falls.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Transactions Exceeded 5 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Improved, Prices Rose Significantly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current market trading of various bonds in the local securities market was extremely sluggish. Only 3,000 yuan of current market of the Six-Year Rehabilitation Bonds were opened, and the others were still unmarketable. The futures market suddenly turned lively. The market sentiment was active, with 2.3 million yuan opened in the morning and 2.7 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling over 5 million yuan. Among them, the tariff market was particularly good, and all parties had considerable transactions, accounting for over 1.8 million. The Continued Rehabilitation Bonds also far outperformed before, with the Rehabilitation Bonds at 1.16 million yuan and the Continued Bonds at over 1 million yuan. The others were very sluggish. The Continued 25 was only over 400,000 yuan, the Fully Paid 6 was 370,000 yuan, the Seven-Year Bond was 165,000 yuan, and the Ninety-Six Financial Bond was tens of thousands of yuan. As for the bond prices, they were still peaceful in the early morning, with slight fluctuations. Later, the market sentiment improved, the buyers were particularly active, and the prices rose step by step. Except for the Seven-Year Bond and the Ninety-Six Financial Bond, which had small inflows and outflows and only rose by a few cents, the others all rose significantly. The futures and Continued Bonds, and the Tariff Bonds for this month rose by about 1 yuan, and the rest also rose by 5 or 6 cents or so, and the trend was quite uniform.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Continues to Be Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned tired, but actual sales in the market were more brisk, and various groups showed signs of improvement. Coarse yarn accounted for the majority, but people's hearts could not be stirred, and there were still many people who were bearish. As a result, when the market rose slightly, the selling wind became fierce. This situation was entirely due to the high inventories and rumors of the current situation. Sellers had stronger courage. If the demand for current yarn from various groups could continue, the market might have the power to rise.</p>
<p>The Manchu Standard was Suppressed by American Cotton and Gold Prices. The market sentiment for the Manchu Standard was weaker in the morning opening, because American cotton fell again and retail investors sold out. The prices of each month fell by 2, 5, or 6 cents. The market heard that gold prices had plummeted at two or three o'clock, and the hearts of the people in the market were moved, and it fell another 6 or 7 cents. The closing price rebounded slightly, and each month fell by 6, 7, 8, 9 cents to 1 tael. Although the actual sales route was good in the afternoon, it was still difficult to raise the popularity, and 4,250 bales of No. 40 were sold in large quantities, and the market situation was collapsed again. As a result, it rose by 1, 2, and 4 cents, and the distant month was flat. The total number of transactions for the whole day was 16,800 bales. The closing prices of the Manchu Standard are recorded on the left,</p>
<p>Manchu Standard Closing Prices, Rise/Fall, Inventory, Closing Price, Rise/Fall, Inventory</p>

<p>Current Sales are Increasing Daily, and Sichuan Stomach is Especially Strong. The sales of current yarn are very smooth, and the Sichuan gang is making great progress. It was found that a total of 3,100 bales were bought by various groups throughout the day, and 750 bales were entered by the same industry. The market rose by 5 cents to 1 tael.

<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Affected by the Sharp Fall in Gold Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly tired, but the trend was still firm. However, actual sales were still sluggish, and the factories had no means of dealing with it. In addition, American cotton fell, and the sellers' minds were more concentrated. As for the buyers, due to the lack of sources from various sources, and the high price of land in Hankou, the attitude of the Hankou gang was strong, and they turned off the current goods and did not sell them.</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard Retraced by 3 Cents. The Futures Cotton Market Opened in the Morning, and the Market Retraced Due to the Fall of American Cotton. The Prices for Each Month Fell. At two or three o'clock, the Market Heard That Gold Prices Had Plunged, and People's Hearts Were Also Tired. The Situation Was Frightened, and the Prices for Each Month Fell by 2 Cents Again. As a Result, the Prices for Each Month Fell. The total turnover for the Whole Day Was 37,000 Loads.

<h3>New York Cotton Exchange's New Rules</h3>
<p>▲ Deliveries No Longer in New York</p>
<p>New York, 26th – A New York dispatch states that the New York Cotton Exchange today passed an amendment with provisions, introducing a new type of contract that eliminates deliveries in New York and price differences for deliveries at various Southern ports. The implementation of this amendment will mean that New York will no longer be a delivery location. The new contract is set to take effect on February 27th, starting with the October term. Transactions under the old contract will continue, but after the end of January next year, transactions will be limited to the new contract. Therefore, futures for October, November, December, and January will have two types of contracts until the end of January next year.</p>

<h3>English-Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>The Bombay cotton market is currently constrained by ample inventories. Broach cotton is more expensive than Gogera and Oomra cotton due to the poor quality of Gogera cotton and upcoming transactions in April and May. However, broadly speaking, Indian cotton remains cheap. If inventories decrease, market prices will undoubtedly be affected. Currently, American cotton is weak, so spot demand in Bombay and Karachi is poor. Local manufacturers are more interested in purchasing Southern cotton. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week    Last Week</p>
<p>Accumulated receipts since September 1st   2,054   2,165</p>
<p>Weekend inventory   1,288   1,300</p>
<p>Accumulated exports since September 1st   1,146   1,204</p>
<p>Exports to Europe     396   418</p>
<p>Exports to China     139   139</p>
<p>Exports to Japan     579   615</p>
<p>Exports to other regions   32   32</p>
<p>Spot sales in Liverpool were very strong last week. Futures prices moved entirely with American cotton. Prices soared, but confidence remains lacking. Egyptian cotton has made slight progress due to government intervention, but largely remains sympathetic to the fluctuations of American cotton.</p>
<h3>Japan's Spindle Count Increases by Another 300,000</h3>
<p>Japanese yarn factories, in an effort to counter the production issues caused by the abolition of nighttime labor, are actively increasing spindles. As a result, production has surged, leading to a 10% reduction in labor, as reported previously. According to a survey by the Japan Textile Federation, as of the end of December last year, there were 6,648,874 spindles, an increase of 300,1568 spindles compared to the end of June. A comparison is shown below:</p>
<p>End of December    End of June    Increase/Decrease Comparison</p>
<p>Ring Spindles     6,612,540     6,310,312     Increase 302,228</p>
<p>Mule Spindles       36,334       63,994       Decrease 660</p>
<p>Total             6,648,874     6,347,306     Increase 301,568</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Slight Recovery in Northern Flour Before Closing</p>
<p>Future Movements Depend on Foreign Wheat Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market experienced price declines, especially for near-term months like March, April, and May. The market was unsettled due to small foreign wheat reports of 5-6 jiao and sharp declines in standard flour prices. Sellers did not offer their goods aggressively, but the market inevitably softened. For example, the lowest price for this month in the afternoon session reached 2.53 yuan, for April 2.5325 yuan, and for May 2.475 yuan, all falling approximately 2 fen compared to the previous week's closing prices. However, in later sessions, most people were wary of repeating the previous week's events, believing that prices would rebound after an easy fall, so they considered it risky to heavily short. Also, slight movement in Northern flour stabilized sentiment, and the market gradually recovered, gaining about 1 fen from the lowest point. However, the final outcome will depend on foreign prices, as speculation among traders seems to have taken on an international character. Consequently, this month's price was down 7.5 li compared to the previous week's closing price, April was down 1 fen, May was down 5 li. Distant-term new flour prices remained stable due to the sudden cold and rain in spring, with June and July remaining unchanged. August, however, was up 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Trend Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon opening of the wheat market, prices for all months were generally unstable. Current fluctuations are purely influenced by foreign prices. As foreign wheat reports remained small and standard flour prices fell sharply, market sentiment was uniformly weak, and prices declined steadily. Prices for distant-term new wheat also showed weakness due to low morale. Consequently, this month's morning price was down 2 fen compared to the previous week's closing price, with no afternoon trading. April was down 5 fen, June was down 1 fen, July was down 2 fen, and August was down 3 fen. Spot wheat prices remained stable because the standard had already reached around 1 qian, and customer sentiment was firm. Factories, due to their needs, could not reject the higher prices, so high-quality goods rose by 2-3 fen. Kainansuzhou wheat was priced at 5.15 yuan to 5.13 yuan, Huangqiao wheat at 5.14 yuan, Taizhou wheat at 5.10 yuan, Mingguang wheat at 5.11 yuan to 5.13 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 5.14 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat at 5.08-9 yuan. A total of 5,300 bags were opened, and Fuxin, Zhonghua, Shenda, and other factories purchased them.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Scarce and Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of various types of rice in Zhabei were scarce, totaling less than 20. Sales in the local market were slightly active, and Northern japonica rice shifted from weak to stable. Sellers initially wanted to raise prices, but buyers refused, resulting in prices remaining the same as the previous session. Arrivals of Bo rice were not strong, and sales were very slow, with little price fluctuation. Yangdu Xian rice from Luliu saw rising prices due to purchases by merchants, so the source was very thin. Ke rice from other ports saw diligent movement due to tight foreign rice supplies, and prices for Ke rice were uniformly firm. Sales of Baiyuan were not brisk, and Dukejian continued to arrive in Shanghai, with prices stagnant and unresponsive.</p>
<p>Few boats arrived in South Shanghai, and market sales were flat. Changxi Sutong and other machine-milled japonica rice saw slightly active sales, with varying buying sentiments in different villages. Upper and middle japonica rice were more active, with no significant price changes. The market for Bozao rice from Southern Qingyong and other regions was sluggish, with weak buying interest and falling prices. Sales of Yangdu Port and other Xian rice were quite successful. Although recent arrivals were low, there was still accumulated stock, resulting in only a slight firmness. Circulation and demand for Yinyuan grains were lackluster, and demand from various merchants was weak, resulting in few transactions and a stable market. Overall, the situation was quieter in South Shanghai than in Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Sales of Piece Goods Improve, Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Fine Cloth Soars by Five Fen. The market showed a sudden tightness yesterday, mainly due to the recent sharp rise in the gold market, which led to cotton yarn prices firming. Cotton cloth prices also rose sharply yesterday, with fine cloth being the strongest, rising by about five fen. Trumpet Boy was priced at 6.775 yuan, Blue Double Fish at 7.5 qian, and Hehe at 7.25 qian. Four Army Man sold over 200 pieces due to mobilization by the Sichuan merchants, also priced at 6.75 yuan. Caibao Niuzhuang, Yantai, and Tianjin all saw strong demand and high prices, selling at 6.85 yuan, the highest price this year. Fine Twill also rose, with Blue Double Fish priced at 6.6 yuan and Yanghe at 6.8 yuan. Coarse cloth was up 2.5 fen. Yihua bleached cloth is out of stock.</p>
<p>Over a hundred pieces of Dongse serge purchased by Sichuan merchants were also stimulated by the plummeting silver prices, leading to a slightly firmer market with slightly improved sales. There were letters from the Yangtze River region yesterday stating that Sichuan merchants had already begun purchasing, with over a hundred pieces of Dong cloth being transacted. Huxinting was priced at 1.7 qian, Six Scholars at 1.65 qian, and Ersunfu at 1.625 qian. Hua Biao Han merchants added a significant number of purchases. Fine cloth saw another rise yesterday, with Shile Bird priced at 7.65 yuan, Double Dragon Pearl at 7.525 yuan, and Yanghong Biao up 5 fen. Six-pound Guo Ju was priced at 3.8 yuan and four-pound at 3.15 yuan. However, due to the abundance of local factory goods, calico still trended downwards. Western-style serge and linen yarn became increasingly active, with over forty pieces sold yesterday. Deji Guo Ziyi sold for 2.85 qian, and Tianyou Tianci Caiyuan for 2.9 qian, with transactions also occurring for Xinji Zhongtiao at 2.29 qian.</p>
<h3>Metals and American Tinplate Soar</h3>
<p>The transaction of American tinplate has been very prosperous recently, but the source is exhausted, and there are frequent instances of supply not meeting demand in the market. Standard prices have therefore risen step by step, and yesterday's market was even stronger. After the guild price rose to 12.5 taels (90 pounds) and 13.25 taels (100 pounds) the day before, general users panicked and rushed to purchase, with the amount of transactions being unprecedented. The solidity of the standard was also unprecedented. It is estimated that a large amount of transactions reached 7-8,000 boxes for the whole day. It is said that most of them are futures, so the future inventory is unlikely to be rich, and the price may continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Seafood Squid Sales Stagnant, Price Drops Two Taels</h3>
<p>Since the opening rise of the squid market, customers have been actively transacting, and the market has been quite firm. Recently, due to the current situation, demand from various merchants has suddenly decreased, and merchants' inventories lack potential buyers. Therefore, the market has begun to trend downwards. The current asking price for Xiangguan Qiushui goods is 48 taels, Gao Dongshui is 47 taels, ordinary is around 46 taels, Jiayou Pian is 42-3 taels, Qiepo is 35-6 taels, Duizhou Erban goods is 46-7 taels, and Jinshan goods is 46 taels to 42 taels. Compared to last month's market, each has fallen by more than two taels, and demand is very weak, leading to a sluggish market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shandong Silk Sources Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>▲ Qingdao Export Goods Public Weighing Tax Case Resolved</p>
<p>Most of the yellow and white silk from Shandong Province is shipped to Shanghai via Qingdao. Previously, due to the local authorities' implementation of an export goods public weighing tax, merchants opposed it and agreed to stop shipping as a countermeasure. As a result, the source of Shandong silk was interrupted. Now that the public weighing tax case has been resolved, Shandong silk is being shipped out in a steady stream. In recent days, regular Qingdao steamships have transported over 300 pieces of yellow and white factory silk. There is strong demand for Shandong yellow factory silk from Britain and France. Yesterday, Dachang and others imported 48 bales, and Ganli imported 30 bales of white factory silk to Shanghai. Prices varied between firm and weak.</p>
