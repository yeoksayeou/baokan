<h3 id="c4">印度與埃及兩問題 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>今日印度與埃及兩問題。以表面論。一則要求完全獨立。正在開始急進之際。一則獨立早告成功。所爭僅遺留未了之問題。其難易固大不同。一則竭印回全體之力。拚大犧牲以與英奮鬥。一則僅數代表折衝於議席之上。從容歡笑而散。事態之輕重又似大異。然以實際言之。印埃兩問題。同一無法解决。未見有難易輕重之分也。</p>
<p>印度之民族運動。發起已久。前此之犧牲。亦已不少。然所要求之藩屬自治地位尚不可得。况乎欲進一步以要求完全獨立。更不易達目的。人所共知。今且兩方相持。情勢愈趨嚴重。解决固甚不易。至英埃今日所談判者。雖僅爲未了之懸案。然關係於兩方之利害。皆甚深切重大。故自埃及獨立。英人提此保留條件而後。首任首相柴魯。爾即親自赴英奮全力以與英人爭。終歸失敗而返。其後屢次交涉。英雖稍有讓步。但對於蘇丹問題。堅持維持現狀之説。絶不能稍有通融。而埃人亦絶對不稍遷就蓋皆不以有關於立國之命脈也。故今日印埃兩問題。表面形勢。雖若有輕重大小之不同。而究其實在。同一無法解决可。以斷言者也。</p>
<p>抑印度與埃及更有一相同之點。即今日所運動者。僅在政治。而一究其貿易經濟情形。則皆操在外人手中。無論商埠内地。銀行商業。農業工業。及一切交通建設。外人皆有鉅大之投資盡力經營。而印埃之人。反處於被壓迫之下。絶少有所發展。由是可知印度之欲求完全獨立。其勢固難。即埃及之去眞正獨立。亦甚遙遠也。</p>

<p>五萬兩控案</p>
<p>張維鏞吳希白在押</p>
<p>原告係向私人控追</p>
<p>註册問題大堪研究</p>
<p>辯論終結定期宣判</p>
<p>廣東路十九號中華市民銀行、自去冬以來、迭發生被控詐欺之案、該行名譽信用、遂有江河日下之勢、然尙勉力支持、迨至三數日前、因主持行務之常務董事張維鏞·總理吳希白·被呂子卿控訴、經特區地方法院拘案覊押、始停止營業、呂係甬籍、現充道達洋行買辦、三月間、呂延葉茀康律師、向前臨時法院控告張維鏞·吳希白·及保人喇文元·不理兩次押欵銀五萬兩、</p>
<p>初借欵二萬兩據訴狀所述、以吳於去年七月間、將中華市民銀行本票三紙、向呂掉現銀一萬五千兩、到期不將本票之欵照付、呂一再向索、始於十月十六日丶由吳將其本人之該銀行兩萬兩之股票·及曹基勳户名坐落上邑二十五保之方單一紙·絶賣契一紙、作爲抵押品、並經喇担保、借足二萬兩之數、訂立契約、以十二月三十一日爲取贖之期、</p>
<p>續又借三萬兩至十二月一日、吳又向呂云、爲維持該行營業、繼續再借規銀三萬兩、否則該行不能週轉、勢須停閉、從前之兩萬借欵、亦必無着、呂祇得允其所請、遂由吳·張·兩人聨名代表該銀行、立據載明、以該行營業權·物權註册執照·及一應生財動產·不動產、作爲抵押品亦定於年底取贖、詎届期分文未還、</p>
<p>分别控請償還經呂調查、除曹基動户名之方單地一畝有效外、其餘抵押品、殊無價値、故特訴追、對於第一次之二萬兩、請求判令吳希白償還、並着保人喇文元負連帶償還責任、至第二次借欵之三萬兩、請求判令吳希白·張維鏞·共同償還、</p>
<p>吳張同遭逮捕並聲明吳·張·有逃亡之虞、原告願提供担保二萬兩現金、請立拘該兩被告到案、於是此曾任全國商會聨合會之會長張維鏞及吳希白、均被覊押、而該行初仍營業、直至日前、實屬無法支撑、乃纔宣告淸理、</p>
<p>原告曾任行長昨晨、該案由特區地方法院許文鎔推事開審、被告三人各延律師辯護、先由原告陳述兩次、借欵情形、將借據信函等件呈案、並否認担任該行行長職務、據被告張維鏞所供、則謂原告於就任行長後、因不能實行其利已之計劃、故遂否認行長之職、但行内一切緊要鎖匙、迄猶在其手、彼所用之心腹兩人、直至將涉訟時、始各離職、當彼任行長時、存户提欵、非特不付、反將辱駡、現尙被人在法公廨控告等語、並提出原告簽字之該行營業賑簿及送信簿、證明呂確係長行、</p>
<p>假名註册欺騙旋開始辯論、先由葉律師陳述、以該行係先設立而後招股、且稱在香港政府註册、但照一九二八年以後、英國會議决英國公司條例規定、須向當地領署註册、始承認爲英國公司、該銀行並未向上海英領署註册、實係假名欺騙、</p>
<p>吳應償二萬兩至原告若果係行長當有聘書等件、送信簿不足爲憑、其在該行賑簿簽字、因借據内載明營業權亦在抵押範圍、被告等特邀呂赴行、一面串人以少數欵持來存儲、使呂簽字、以堅其信仰該行確有存户之心、而爲借欵之香餌、觀於兩萬兩借據之措詞實爲吳個人之借欵、故應由吳償還、喇則負担保之責、而三萬兩者當由吳張共同償還、並追遲延利息云云、</p>
<p>行長責任問題繼由被告之律師辯護、首言借欵數目不符、可見尙有内幕、次論責任問題、請原告實係該行行長、該行一應賬據、皆存庫中、鎖匙尙在原告處、請令交出、俾可吊取簿據調查、自可明瞭借欵確數、及用途、</p>
<p>同意領署調查末並同意原告律師請求、向英領署調查之主張、謂此舉不但可解决是否英領署註册之爭執、且可證明原告究竟是否該行股東、</p>
<p>辯論宣告終結辯畢、被告之律師、復提兩點、（一）張·吳·兩人被押兩月、致該行大受損失、馴致停業、應保留損害賠償部份、（二）請將被告開釋、許推事諭本案辯論終結、定期五月十二日上午宣判、被告張維鏞·吳希白·還押、着具保狀、聽候核准交保、</p>

<p>六十萬大騙案</p>
<p>最初放印子錢於妓寮</p>
<p>貪厚息存户逐漸增多</p>
<p>付息金多至四十六萬</p>
<p>法院淸理被告之財產</p>
<p>前在閘北四區警署充當巡長之河北人楊樹林、自辭退公役後、虚設公司、假辦實業爲名、騙取存欵六十萬之鉅、案發連同其跑街夥江北麻子·何其淸·一併被拘、已誌本報、而造成此鉅數騙案之原因、一般惟　重利之徒、實亦有以促成之、</p>
<p>挨户分發利息緣楊初以放印子錢爲業、大都將欵借與四馬路各妓寮、俾作淫業基本、索取月息六分、借者旣多、楊之本金有限、遂異想天開、轉貸於人、誘以重利、每月給息五分、且届派息之期、派人挨户分送、於是貪婪鄙夫、利令智昏、相繼將欵供給、馴至本利皆無、間雖有曾略收利子金者、然亦得不償失、</p>
<p>存户分子複雜查存户共有千人、其中份子複雜、有智識階級、有機關職員、有商人、有婦女、並有男女勞動界僕役等等、現已組織債權團、初由葉茀康律師辦理、但往葉處登記者、人數寥寥、繼改由徐炳成·徐福基·父子兩律師辦理、往徐處登記者、業有三百九十餘人、</p>
<p>存欵愈積愈多徐原係楊所設文記公司之法律顧問、今又代表該公司債權人辦理事務、並代表債權具狀起訴、該狀叙述甚詳、謂被告楊樹林、係於丙寅創設合興公司、丁卯增設文記公司、嗣乃陸續設立分號十餘處之多、各界見其分號日增、營業擴張、舊有存户、除官利外、尙給紅利、由是輾轉傳述、信仰者日衆、存欵愈多、</p>
<p>其妾迄尙在逃本年二月十四、楊僞稱被綁之事宣布後、各債權始猶信以爲眞、乃公推顧竹軒·曹幼珊·設法維持、是時方悉各户存欵達六十餘萬、正登記淸理間、忽得楊存洋被扣之消息、各存户始知楊存心不良、由曹派人赴津、伴同返滬、以圖補救、不意回滬後、一味延挨、揑造賬簿、至本月二日下午、楊與其妾陳浣溪、又將同逃、幸先將何其淸拏獲、經其供出匿跡地點、方續將楊逮捕、惟其妾迄尙在逃、</p>
<p>請求嚴緝楊妾查楊所騙之欵、以去年秋冬二季爲多、有卅六七萬之巨、迨至在津被扣、其妾始吐露眞情、謂綁票係屬誑語、並將箱籠搬運藏匿、是楊妾實係串通、請求嚴緝到案、</p>
<p>僞綁欵應追繳且楊在津兩次來函、均言彼當時身帶鈔幣五萬二千元、被綁匪搶去現綁票一層、旣已證明子虚、則該欵應令楊交出、</p>
<p>倒賬顯係揑造又楊所造營業狀况表、第三欵有自丙寅至庚午倒賬五萬一千二百九十元、但遍查賬簿、均無此種記載、顯係揑造、亦請令楊先行交出、其他各賬丶自相矛盾之處甚多丶請求詳細調查、然後將楊從嚴懲辦云云、</p>
<p>分號均無規模狀内所述設有分號十餘處、則係指合興·文記·兩公司外之文記養蜂公司·普利達鋼鐵廠·衛生菜</p>

<p>園·合興錢莊·合興金號·合盛永·合盛　·等十店而言、但一考其實際、誠堪發笑、所謂鋼鐵廠則、爲一鐵店、衛生菜　者、乃係向閘北鄕僻處租貨地畝、作爲菜園、種菜出賣而已、他如合興金號·合興錢莊、資本皆極微細、其餘更自噲以下、不足道矣、</p>
<p>到庭三百餘人昨日午後、該案由特區地方法院孫原推事開第三法庭、飭將楊樹林·何其淸·兩被告提案研訊、各債權人男婦到者、不下三百餘人、其訴訟代表則爲曹幼珊·葛靑山·朱　朔·鄭瓊記·史有惠·朱企氏·董致和·盧玉山·楊海根·王仲記·尙德成。劉子英·等十二人、先由該十二人陳述存欵數目、間有將存據呈案者、此項存欵、據旣非存摺、又非存單、其形式如借據相同、</p>
<p>楊樹林之供詞旅經孫推事訊問被告楊樹林據供、文記於七年開設、初祇放印子　、取息六分、至十二年始吸收存欵、而給予五分之息、存户大都係友人介紹、至十五年存者漸多、十七年政府下令禁止盤剥重利、我擬改圖、遂興辦實業、去歲年底、因無力給付五分之息金、乃改爲三分、各存户遂紛紛提欵、無法維持、祇得僞稱綁票、避往天津、但家鄕並無產業、我付給各存户之息金、俱有回單簿可查等語、</p>
<p>息金四十六萬繼述各分號開設之地點及每處資本數目、經理姓名、總計其分號資本、不足五萬、經理者什九爲警界閒散人員、孫推事因嚴詰其如許巨資、究作何用、楊則稱放出之欵、約計三十二萬、此外所付息金、亦達四十六萬之多、均有賬可稽等語、</p>
<p>跑街猶復憒憒次訊何其淸、據供伊充合興公司跑街、合興專做期票貼現營業、文記公司係放印子錢爲業云云、何爲一不識字之愚夫、對於楊之欺騙行爲、似不明瞭、堅稱伊放出之貼現欵項、可向出票之人去取、蓋彼猶不知此項期票於到期後、已被楊向出票者收去矣、研訊良久、孫推事以尙須調查、諭兩被告還押、改期再訊、並因淸理被告財產事件、關係重要、决由法院派員擔任淸理、</p>

<p>蘇州女體育會組織以來、一破向日沉寂之女體育空氣、舉行歷决舉行球類、亦曾提高興趣不少、因之素不重視體育之各校、亦競以體育是尙、蘇女中連次執省女球類賽之牛耳、亦非偶然耳、惟該會組織之後、初未舉行田徑賽一次、於是女體育之發展、僅及畸形、値至最近始有田徑賽運動之議、按蘇州社會對於女子運動初未注意、經該會之提倡、遂爭先往觀以欣賞、此短褌白腿之巾幗英雄、公團道上遂平添愛好運動之仕女不少、而公共體育塲以地幅關係、於秩序方面、又未能維持於熱鬧之狀况、以無秩序而更爲顯露矣、</p>
<p>預賽結果</p>
<p>各校以功課關係、故直至下午四時始行到齊、迨舉行比賽、已四時有半、預賽九組成績良好、想决賽時當有更驚人之表現也茲錄其成績如下、至二百米接力初定預賽以秩序欠佳而止現准今日（十日）由七組一次决賽、不復再舉行預賽、　　五十米</p>

<p>會塲花絮</p>
<p>人衖堂的跑道是日天明日暖觀衆以不能遵守秩序童子軍、又不管閒事致百米五十米之跑道形成一直綫之人衖堂、其間尤以各校同學爲多數、彩色紙傘與濃裝淡服、相映成趣也、</p>
<p>這條腿白來兮是日參加各校之運動員、裝朿極一例、成烈女生完全裸腿、東吳則一部分裸、</p>
<p>其白晰之腿部、而上裝衣白紅色、尤形漂亮、該校運動員劉蒼蔚紅衣跣足休息時、披白綢外罩飄逸如神仙、劉女士素有呂宋小姐之徽號、觀衆因此遂爭喚呂宋小姐這條腿白來兮、</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Problems of India and Egypt <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Today's problems of India and Egypt, on the surface, are that one is demanding complete independence and is in the midst of a radical push, while the other achieved independence long ago, and is merely disputing remaining unresolved issues. The difficulty would appear to be vastly different. One involves the combined strength of all Indians and Muslims, making great sacrifices to fight England, while the other involves only a few representatives negotiating in the halls of parliament, calmly laughing and dispersing. The importance of the situation also seems quite different. However, in reality, the problems of India and Egypt are equally unsolvable, and there is no difference in their difficulty or importance.</p>
<p>The national movement in India began long ago, and the sacrifices made previously have been considerable. However, the status of dominion autonomy, which they seek, is still unattainable. How much more difficult is it to take a step further and demand complete independence? It is common knowledge that the two sides are now deadlocked, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. A resolution is indeed very difficult. As for what England and Egypt are negotiating today, although it is only a matter of unresolved issues, it deeply and significantly affects the interests of both parties. Therefore, since Egypt's independence, after the British proposed these reserved conditions, the first Prime Minister, Zaghoul, personally went to England and exerted all his efforts to argue with the British, but ultimately failed and returned. Since then, there have been repeated negotiations. Although the British have made slight concessions, they insist on maintaining the status quo on the issue of Sudan and absolutely cannot compromise, while the Egyptians also absolutely refuse to yield, because they all consider it to be related to the lifeblood of the nation. Therefore, today's problems of India and Egypt, although the surface situation seems to have differences in importance and size, in reality, they are equally unsolvable. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Moreover, India and Egypt have another thing in common, which is that the movements today are only in politics, but when one examines their trade and economic situation, they are all controlled by foreigners. Whether it is in commercial ports or the interior, banks, commerce, agriculture, industry, and all transportation construction, foreigners have huge investments and are fully engaged in operations, while the people of India and Egypt are instead in a state of oppression and have little development. From this, it can be seen that India's desire for complete independence is certainly difficult, and even Egypt's path to true independence is very distant.</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Sun Dianying sent a representative, accompanied by his councilor, to Xuzhou from Bozhou on the evening of the 7th, staying at the Huayuan Hotel. They are currently in contact with Liu Zhi to discuss everything. The representative told reporters that Sun himself is now in Bozhou and will unite with Wan Xuancai, Shi Yousan, Fan Xingmin, Liu Guitang, Ren Yingqi, Wang Zhen, and other units to pledge allegiance to the Central Government, not to fight for Yan and Feng, and to peacefully resolve the situation in Henan. He came to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and will return to Bozhou to report and proceed after receiving instructions. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Northern Party-Government Plan <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Various Factions Agree on Two Principles</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Replies in Agreement</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tan Zhen, Fu Rulin, Mao Zuquan, and Tao Ye arrived in Beiping yesterday. Tao told reporters that the participants in the Tianjin talks were Chen Gongbo, Hu Zongduo, Guo Taiqi, Ye Qi, Zhang Zhiben, and the four of us, for a total of nine people. They first decided on two principles: First, to put the party and the nation first and eliminate all personal or factional animosity; second, to completely adopt extraordinary measures, cutting off all the disputes within the party in the past few years and the various reconciliation methods discussed in recent months. Under these two principles, they decided on a new way out: First, regarding party affairs, to reopen the Third National Congress; second, regarding national affairs, to convene a National Assembly, handing over the party's political power to the people, enacting a constitution. They telegraphed this intention to Wang, requesting him to draft a declaration. Wang replied in agreement and also telegraphed the draft of the declaration. The declaration is about three to four hundred words long, first describing the current situation, then describing the methods for party affairs and national affairs after the outbreak of the war, accommodating Yan's entire proposition for a unified party and a unified national government. We have already replied, and Wang's telegram agreed. The current transitional method is to use an extraordinary meeting to produce an enlarged committee of cadres, and then the enlarged committee will produce a central political conference. Regardless of whether they are party members or non-party members, those with qualifications and knowledge will be invited to participate. Then the political conference will produce a government. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Gongbo told reporters that he had several talks with Tan Zhen and others in Tianjin to exchange opinions, but it was not a meeting. Because Wang has always advocated holding an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee, this exchange of opinions is based on this. Wang's telegram draft advocated opening an enlarged meeting of the Central Committee Party Department and did not mention holding an extraordinary meeting. I received a telegram from Wang last night in Tianjin, saying that the Second Central Committee should also issue a declaration. My proposition for the party is: first, there must be overall unity, not just the unity of a few leaders; second, there must be permanent unity, not temporary unity. Therefore, the beginning of unity must be carefully discussed. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Gongbo and Ding Chungao came to Tianjin to negotiate party affairs. They took the evening train to Beiping on the 9th. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan and Feng telegraphed Wang Bai, Zhao Zou, Xie Xue, and Shang in Taiyuan, asking them to come to Beiping to discuss the new method, setting aside party unity and using completely revolutionary means. Zou and Xie are essentially in agreement with the facts and should agree, etc. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Shanxi delegation urged Yan to form a government as soon as possible, saying that if a formal government cannot be established in the shortest possible time, they can only form a temporary government or a military government first, to meet the expectations of the army and the people, without waiting for the cumbersome procedures of extraordinary meetings, enlarged committees, and political conferences, in order to deal with the situation. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Mao Zuquan hosted a banquet for Huang Shaogu, Fu Rulin, Tao Ye, Tan Zhen, and Jin Jiafei at Chongxiao Temple this afternoon to view the flowers and discuss the preparation matters for future meetings. Li Xijiu and Guo Taiqi are still staying in Tianjin for a few days, seemingly having another telegram with Wang Chen, and Li will decide whether to go to Hong Kong after Wang's reply arrives. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Gongbo arrived in Beiping this afternoon. Wang Faqin, Bai Yunti, and Xie Chi may leave Taiyuan for Beiping today. Zou Lu will come later due to illness. Here, we will start forming a temporary central cadre after Zhao Daiwen and Shang Zhen arrive in Beiping. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Reorganization Faction, the Xishan Faction, and the Guangxi Faction recently held a joint meeting in Tianjin, resulting in the following three resolutions: (1) Convene the Third National Congress to handle party affairs; (2) Convene the National Assembly to handle national affairs; (3) Enact a constitution. Wang Jingwei telegraphed on the 6th to express his approval, and on the 7th, he telegraphed the declaration text. It is said that after Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and the official consent from all parties have arrived, a cadre meeting will be organized, and a political conference will be held to adopt the declaration.

<p>The Sudan Problem Remains Unresolved, Becoming a Pending Issue</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Declares the Door to Negotiations Remains Open</p>
<p>Egyptian Representatives Depart for Home Yesterday</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th - The Egyptian delegation issued a statement saying that despite the sincere and genuine efforts of both Britain and Egypt, and despite Egypt's willingness to maintain its rights in Sudan to the bare minimum, "we have ultimately failed to reach an agreement, or even an understanding, on the Sudan problem, which is most unfortunate." "This trip to England has allowed us to establish the most pleasant relationships with British Foreign Secretary Henderson and other members of the British government, members of Parliament, and opposition leaders, and has allowed us to deeply understand the true nature of the British people, who are indeed hospitable and full of friendly sympathy." "Although we have lost the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Friendship, we have gained extremely important and genuine friendship." British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons today that although both sides made extremely sincere and friendly efforts, the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations ultimately failed (the Conservative Party cheered, while the Labor Party shouted "Shameful!") because the British government could not accept the Egyptian representatives' demands regarding Sudan. The Foreign Office will soon release a white paper on the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. A member asked whether the status quo would be maintained based on the four major points previously mentioned. The British Foreign Secretary replied that this was the natural outcome of the failure of the negotiations. The so-called four major points mentioned above are the conditions reserved by Britain in 1922 for future resolution: (1) protecting Egypt from foreign aggression; (2) protecting British imperial communications; (3) protecting British and minority nationalities in Egypt; (4) Sudan. This meeting was proposed by the British Foreign Secretary last August after talks in London with Egyptian Prime Minister Mahammad, in order to conclude a treaty to resolve the aforementioned pending issues. When the British Foreign Secretary sent a note to the Egyptian government, he stated that the sections he proposed represented the minimum that he could request the British government to accept. At the end of March this year, the new Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas led his entourage to London to begin negotiations. Except for the periods when the Egyptian representatives requested instructions from Egypt, they met almost every day. Today, the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations were reported to have broken down, but the British Foreign Secretary stated in the House of Commons that the friendship between the two sides was very good and that he believed that this friendship could continue. The Egyptian problem could have been resolved, but the Egyptian representatives abandoned substance and wanted to discuss the Sudan issue. This meeting was convened to discuss Egyptian affairs, not Sudanese affairs. The British Foreign Secretary left for Geneva at 4:00 PM. The Egyptian delegation will leave London tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 8th - Everyone is disappointed by the failure of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, but in light of the friendly atmosphere in London, it is hoped that a complete agreement can be reached sooner or later.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - With the exception of the Daily Express and the Daily Mail, which lamented the failure of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, other newspaper editorials stated that Egypt's demands regarding Sudan were absolutely unacceptable, and therefore they were comforted by the failure of the treaty.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - The Egyptian delegation departed from London for home today. Egyptian students and others were waiting at Victoria Station. When Prime Minister Nahas arrived at the station, the crowd surrounded him, waving Egyptian flags and shouting incessantly. There were also banners with the words "Long Live Independent Egypt and Sudan." Army Minister Shaw and representatives from the Foreign Office and the Prime Minister's Office were among those seeing them off. Before leaving, the Egyptian delegation had a half-hour cordial conversation with the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street to say goodbye. The Egyptian delegation was in excellent spirits and told the Reuters representative that they hoped to return to London soon.</p>

<p>Indian Muslims Suddenly Express Non-Cooperation Again</p>
<p>Lancashire Adds Ten Thousand Unemployed Workers</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 8th - The All-India Muslim League Council has passed a resolution disagreeing with the non-violent resistance movement, believing it is detrimental to the interests of Muslims, and advising Muslims not to join the movement. The Council also advocated that Muslims should issue leaflets as propaganda to make the villagers fully aware of the truth of the situation. The resolution requested the government to immediately announce the date and participants of the Round Table Conference in order to ease public anxiety and restore the trust of moderate elements in the country. The Council also passed a resolution expressing the anxiety of Indian Muslims regarding the shooting and wounding incident in North-West Frontier Province, and stated that the government's communiqué on this matter was insufficiently clear. In order to dispel doubts, the government should allow the Muslim League Council to send personnel to North-West Frontier Province to investigate the facts. The National Society reported from London that the Daily Mail reported that several textile factories in Lancashire had stopped production due to the stagnation of English goods due to the Indian boycott, and the number of unemployed workers would increase by another 10,000. Reuters, Poona, 9th - One hundred and fifty people who fled from Sholapur arrived here this morning. It is said that during yesterday's disturbance, three policemen were arrested by the mob, doused in kerosene, and burned alive. The turmoil did not subside until 6:00 PM. Yesterday's riot in Sholapur clearly had a social nature, as the three policemen who were burned alive were all Muslims. (Note: Sholapur is the same as the Shivalapore reported yesterday.)</p>

<p>Rivera's Party Conspired to Launch a Major Uprising</p>
<p>The Authorities' Stern Measures Succeeded in Suppressing the Seeds of Rebellion</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 8th - The stern measures taken by Spanish Prime Minister General Berenguer have suppressed the seeds of rebellion. The masterminds of this conspiracy were three generals from the former Dictator Rivera's party, with General Anido as the chief plotter. It was planned that Anido would seize the capital Madrid, General Barrera would seize Barcelona, and General Salo would launch an uprising in the south at the same time. It is said that a large part of the garrison in Barcelona had secretly agreed to respond, and three regiments of the garrison in Madrid were also involved. It is still difficult to know whether the King was aware of it in advance, but it is expected that if the coup were successful, the King would not have been unwilling to alleviate the current predicament somewhat. Currently, these three main figures have not been arrested, but troops have been secretly dispatched to monitor them closely at home. When the rumors were at their most dangerous, Spanish Republican leaders Ariano, Lero, Guerra, and Generals Aguirrera and Rickmo also gathered at the home of former Minister of Free Rights Villano to prepare to issue orders for an uprising, expel the dictator, and establish considerable ties with labor unions and Republican leaders in order to simultaneously declare a general strike throughout the country.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 9th - The House of Peers' budget general meeting convened at 1:00 PM on the 8th. Kiyoki Inoue, a member of the Kosei Association, first questioned the issue of supreme command, saying, "In order to ensure the success of the naval disarmament conference, the government disregarded the strong opposition of the Chief of the Naval General Staff and adopted a compromise plan. Is this true or false?" Prime Minister Hamaguchi replied, "When the government decided on the instructions for the naval disarmament conference, there was no disregard for the existence of the Naval General Staff." Afterwards, there were several exchanges of questions and answers, but Prime Minister Hamaguchi always answered that the content of the negotiations with the Naval General Staff was outside the scope of the answer and still did not give a satisfactory answer. The House of Peers believed that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's answer regarding the negotiations with the Naval General Staff leadership to determine military strength had many false points, and many were indignant. The future situation continues to be dangerous. Navy Minister Tsai Bu's entry into Beijing is not far off, and this issue is gradually becoming more significant.</p>
<p>Telecommunications, Tokyo, 9th - The movement to resolve the issue of supreme command in a non-partisan manner has gradually taken shape. The young members of the Minseito Party have agreed to elect an executive committee to begin negotiations with the Seiyukai Party.

<p>Capital Holds Commemoration of the May 9th National Humiliation</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a commemorative ceremony in the grand auditorium at 6:00 AM on the morning of the May 9th National Humiliation commemoration. Above the meeting hall hung a horizontal banner with the inscription "Sleeping on Brushwood and Tasting Gall." Slogans on either side read, "Commemorate May 9th, support the central government's vigorous construction to cultivate the strength to overthrow imperialism," and "Commemorate May 9th, promote domestic goods, develop Manchuria and Mongolia, and resist Japan's attempts to invade China." Attendees included Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Wang Boqun, Chen Guofu, Jiao Yitang, Chen Lifu, Chen Yaoyuan, Enkeba Tu, Yu Jingtang, and others, as well as representatives from various government departments and institutions, and faculty and students from the Central Political School, totaling approximately 450 people. Hu Hanmin chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman delivered an opening speech, stating that when Yuan Shikai recklessly pursued his imperial dream, it gave Japanese imperialists an opportunity to launch their aggression, forcing us to accept the Twenty-One Demands under the threat of an ultimatum, attempting to make China a continuation of Korea. On this day fifteen years ago, we were forced to acknowledge this treasonous contract. Although the Party and the people have consistently opposed it and have not fully assumed responsibility for its implementation, the nation, under the coercion of this power, has suffered immense humiliation. When the European War ended and the Shandong issue of our country was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference, the situation was extremely dangerous. Fortunately, patriotic youths rushed about and appealed, strongly preventing our country's representatives from signing. This shows that the people's spirit is still</p>

<p>Continuing Important News</p>
<p>not extinguished. However, for more than a decade, warlords with deeply ingrained feudal ambitions have willingly served as tools for imperialists, guiding their various political and economic aggressions, resulting in countless shameful and humiliating events. Now, Yan Xishan has once again exposed the face of a warlord remnant, openly betraying the Party and the nation, undermining unity, endangering the people, and even losing his mind by attempting to mortgage the Cangshi Railway to borrow money, undermining tariff independence. Recent European telegrams indicate that the Moscow Declaration states that Yan Xishan has expressed extreme friendliness towards Russia, urging Mo Dehui to conclude a commercial and friendly treaty with Russia. This statement is particularly bizarre. The central government sent Mo Dehui to Russia for a conference, but his authority is limited to resolving the Sino-Eastern Railway issue and does not include the responsibility of revising any other treaty. Yet, Yan Xishan has taken this opportunity to seek favor with the Russians, essentially expressing his willingness to unite with the Communist Party, a recklessness even surpassing that of Yuan Shikai. Therefore, on this occasion of commemorating national humiliation, it is not just about emotional sentiment; it is about fundamentally eradicating the disgrace. The following are what all Party comrades and the entire nation should pay close attention to: (1) Strive to abolish all unequal treaties and eliminate consular jurisdiction, so that the nation and the people can obtain the benefits of freedom and equality. (2) Understand that to redress national humiliation, we must first seek national governance. We cannot deviate in the slightest from the Three People's Principles and the National Reconstruction Program. Everyone should be of one mind and continue the spirit to promote political development. (3) Recognize that Yan Xishan's rebellion and undermining of unity not only harms the Party but also poses a major obstacle to the peaceful and prosperous life desired by the entire nation. We must assist the government in eliminating this traitorous and harmful ringleader. (4) Understand that there is no reason in the world for a part of the military to contend with the central government for power. Like Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, who first rebelled and harmed the Party and the nation, and still proclaim their banner as protecting the Party and saving the nation to deceive the people, the true location of right and wrong must be clearly understood and not confused. (5) Implement the Principle of People's Livelihood to strengthen national power and prevent the economic aggression of imperialists. The difference between China's exports and imports is vast, with an annual loss of 200 million yuan. The impact on the national economy is evident. We should quickly catch up, increase production, and promote domestic goods. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. The above are all essential methods for washing away national humiliation. The speaker also thinks of two things: (1) The Chinese economic world can be said to have only rich old men, but no capitalists, let alone industrialists. These old rich men follow feudalism, only wishing for personal wealth and not caring about the interests of the masses, leading to a large number of unemployed and making it difficult for political stability. (2) Chinese women, due to their love of fashion, rush to buy foreign goods without distinguishing whether they are beautiful or not, resulting in the decline of domestic goods and increasing the leakage of wealth. I sincerely hope that everyone will correct this quickly, focus on promoting industry, and love domestic goods, so that the country's future may have hope for development. After the speech, the ceremony ended and the meeting was dismissed.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters held a commemoration of the May 9th National Humiliation meeting for all sectors of the capital at 9:00 AM in the headquarters' auditorium. More than 200 representatives from various agencies and national organizations attended. Shi Weihuan chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported on the significance of the commemoration, stating that the May 9th National Humiliation was due to Yuan Shikai's desire to fulfill his imperial dream, sacrificing the happiness of 40,000 compatriots and signing the Twenty-One Demands with Japan. Now that Yuan Shikai is dead, the Twenty-One Demands have not yet been abolished, which is extremely painful. Today, as we commemorate the national humiliation, we should unite and work hard to abolish these Twenty-One Demands, which are humiliating our nation, so that next year's May 9th will no longer need this commemoration. Subsequently, Lai Lian, Lou Tongsun, Li Yuanbai, and others delivered speeches, mainly stating that the Twenty-One Demands were indeed forced upon us by Japanese imperialism, but the failure to eliminate domestic traitors was also a major cause of this humiliating situation. Therefore, in commemorating the national humiliation, we should first eliminate the remnants of domestic warlords, and then work hard to overthrow imperialism and abolish the Twenty-One Demands, so that this extraordinary humiliation can be washed away. After the speeches, slogans were shouted and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Express report from Bengbu: The battles that had been brewing for more than a month have had minor contact since the 2nd of this month. Before the opening of fire, the Northwest Army's Wan Xuancai's troops had already set up a defensive line east of Guide and west of Mamuji. On the 1st of this month, they began to advance eastward. Sun Dianying's troops in the border area between Henan and Anhui also planned to advance simultaneously. Unexpectedly, Shen Fenggang's unit, the so-called combat-capable training division of that army, suddenly mutinied in Luyi, collapsing before the battle, their morale greatly weakened. According to front-line intelligence, the troops of Sun Wan on the Longhai Railway first opened fire with the Central Army on the border of Henan, and after a brief contact, they retreated toward Guide. The Third Division then occupied Xiayi. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the newly formed 21st Division in the Taihe area made contact with Yue Xiangru's troops of Sun Dianying, engaging in fierce fighting for several hours. Yue's front line was broken by the 21st Division, which then surrounded Yue's troops three times. They then quickly seized the Feihekou. Yue's elite troops suffered heavy losses. On the 3rd, the 10th Division in the Guoyang area also defeated Sun Dianying's troops in the areas of Genghuang Temple, Shatuji, and Chengfuzhai. It is heard that they are only a dozen miles away from the city. Sun's troops in Guide, facing the emergency in Haozhou, rushed to reinforce Haozhou, while Wan Xuancai's troops also moved east from the west of Guide, replacing Sun's troops. Their actions over the past few days have been very hurried. According to current observations, there will be a fierce battle in Guide and Haozhou within a few days. (May 7th)</p>

<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The Anhui North Garrison Command, originally established in Hefei, was later moved to Shouzhou. Wei Lihuang, the garrison commander and commander of the 45th Division, then went to Shouzhou to take charge and suppress bandits in northern Anhui. The Garrison Command has recently received orders to move to Bengbu. The internal officials and soldiers arrived in Bengbu yesterday (the 6th) from Shouzhou by gasoline boat. Those who arrived included Guo Jun, the chief of staff of the 45th Division, Zhu Ding, the chief of staff, and others, residing in the 45th Division Headquarters at the Traffic Villa. The officers and soldiers of the Garrison Command resided in the Liya Hotel. Today (the 7th), the staff office of the division headquarters moved to Furun Lane on Erma Road to work, while the adjutant's office remained in the Traffic Villa. The two departments have been working together since today. The Anhui North Garrison Command will be reorganized, and personnel will soon be announced. Wei Lihuang is expected to come to Bengbu after the 10th of this month. As for Wei's previous position as commander of the 8th Army of the Anti-Rebellion Army, the headquarters has changed the appointment to Ye Kaixin, the commander of the 52nd Division. (May 7th)</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Fan Xiji, the commander of the 26th Army, after moving to Jining, yesterday (the 6th) reported to Chen Tiaoyuan, the chairman of Shandong Province, that the defense arrangements in the area had been completed. Chen held a meeting at the general headquarters that night to discuss military affairs in western and northern Shandong, which adjourned around 10 p.m. Chen considered that western Shandong was adjacent to eastern Henan, and the defense situation was very important, and it was necessary to conduct an on-the-spot inspection. He left Jinan by special train for Jining at 2:20 a.m. this morning (the 7th), accompanied by Fan Xiji. Those who accompanied him included Liu Jingbo, the chief of the logistics department of the General Reserve Corps, Wang Kaiqing, the chief of the ordnance department, Lu Wannian, a cipher clerk, and staff officers, adjutants, and counselors, etc. This trip will first go to Yanzhou and then to Jining, and it is expected that he can return to Jinan the next night. Yue Shengxuan, the commander of the 163rd Brigade, has been appointed as the commander of the 57th Division by the central government and is still under the jurisdiction of the 26th Army. Yang Mingfang, the deputy commander of the brigade, has been appointed as the brigade commander, and he took office yesterday. The military strength in western Shandong has now reached more than three divisions. On the 5th and 6th, Chen Tiaoyuan also ordered Song Runtian's troops of the newly formed Supplementary First Brigade and Liang Hongen's troops of the Second Brigade, stationed in Xinzhuang, to go to Jining one after another to assist in the defense. As for the defense of northern Shandong and the Jiaoji Railway, it is the responsibility of Han Fuju's troops of the Third Route Army. Han recently sent Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 12th Army, to inspect the Yucheng area, and Cao Fulin, the commander of the 14th Army, to inspect the defense along the Jiaoji Railway. Both returned to Jinan yesterday. Han held a military affairs meeting at the headquarters of the First Army Corps yesterday (the 6th) at noon, attended by Cao Fulin, Sun Tongxuan, and Gu Liangmin, the commander of the 22nd Division.

<p>And Urge the National Government to Implement Revolutionary Diplomacy</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The people here are extremely indignant about the May 3rd Massacre. On the 3rd, all circles held a commemoration meeting for the second anniversary of the May 3rd Massacre, and resolved to telegraph the Central Committee to forward it to the National Government, instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Japanese side to quickly send a committee to investigate the Jinan Incident, in order to seek an early resolution of the Jinan Incident and urge the National Government to implement revolutionary diplomacy, and to denounce Yan Feng. The telegram is recorded as follows: (1) To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: The signing of the Jinan Incident Agreement has now passed a year. At that time, due to various relationships, we painfully made an alliance, and the people of the country have a common understanding. Moreover, there is a clause in the agreement that China and Japan will send personnel to form a Jinan Incident Investigation Committee. The general public still has a few hopes, hoping that the results of the investigation will reveal justice. However, since the withdrawal of the Japanese army stationed in Shandong, the investigation has become empty. For more than a year, the families of the victims of the massacre have been crying out everywhere. The people of the country are not entirely forgetful, and the government cannot bear to delay it for long. To comfort the people and establish national credibility, please forward it to the National Government, instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Japanese side to quickly appoint a committee to investigate the Jinan Incident, in order to seek an early resolution. Painfully ponder over it, and it will be enough to comfort it slightly. The telegram is urgent and awaiting orders. (2) To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: The May 3rd Massacre has now been two years ago, and the Sino-Japanese Agreement is only enough for the people of the country to record the pain. The army and civilians who died tragically are buried at the bottom of the sea. The ashes of the artillery fire are still faintly visible. The reason why the revolutionary government washed away national humiliation and comforted the people has long been in silence. The heart of the people has not died, and the remaining pain is still severe. Is it not a great regret? Moreover, in the past two years, Japanese imperialists have intensified their aggression, killing people in Tieling, Northeast China, and building roads in Ji Hui. Their brutality has become increasingly evident. In addition, the Middle-East Railroad is being forced into the hands of the Soviet Union, and Nepalese soldiers are invading our Tibet. Our international status has indeed become increasingly dangerous. It is not just a matter of decline. The reason for this is nothing more than the Jinan Incident Agreement, which is like an alliance under the city and has enlightened it. At this juncture, if we do not try to salvage the situation, what can we imagine for the future? In order to maintain the international status of the Republic of China and establish the faith of the revolutionary government, please instruct the National Government to implement revolutionary diplomacy in order to resist the disaster of the barbarians and to meet the people's wishes. The future of the Party and the country depends on it. (3) To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, the National Government, various departments and commissions, various provincial and municipal party headquarters, governments at all levels, various people's organizations, chiefs of various routes, army division brigade commanders, and various newspapers: Japanese imperialists created the May 3rd Massacre, slaughtering more than 5,000 of our people. This unprecedented disaster and Chinese humiliation, all people of blood and energy should vow to kill the enemy and strive to wash away the humiliation. The reactionary warlords Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang have rebelled and destroyed unity, which is already a great treason. Moreover, they have colluded with Japanese imperialists, auctioned off mineral resources, and signed agreements to borrow money. It seems that they are begging for help from the enemy and betraying the motherland. They have absolutely no heart and liver. They are not just recognizing the thief as their father, but are truly public enemies of the nation and scum of the nation. Please all parties denounce them and eliminate the two rebels in order to secure the Party and the country. The telegram is overflowing with indignation.</p>

<p>Shortage of Vehicles</p>
<p>Difficulty in Coping</p>
<p>Pukou Correspondence: The Jinpu Railway has been affected by military affairs in recent years. Most of the locomotives and passenger cars have been driven into other lines, making transportation quite difficult. The authorities have been working day and night to repair the locomotives and passenger cars damaged in the factory, so that they can barely cope. Since the Northwest military affairs occurred last year, the Transportation Commander He has transferred and used them, and the Shi Department rebellion took them away. A total of 57 locomotives and 843 passenger and freight cars were driven over the rails in two times, reducing the total number by two-thirds, and the dispatching suddenly became exhausted. Two locomotives and 50 freight cars were borrowed from Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo to meet urgent needs. Later, the Jinpu-Longhai Railway Transportation Command was established, and more than ten trains of vehicles were successively transferred from the line for military use, which made the line's transportation even more difficult. Although it is said that Han's troops recently brought 19 trains of Jinpu military cars, including 19 locomotives and 33</p>

Qian Yulin and others said that the plaintiffs had reported old cases and had already been approved by the Sandy Land Bureau to determine property rights and could build the embankment. Zhu Tingyan used the excuse of pickets, deliberately violated the law, infringed on rights, crossed the border, rushed to build the embankment, and fabricated accusations to frame people.

<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item in your newspaper on May 5 about a telegram from Nanjing stating that Fang Zhenwu had moved to Gulou Hospital for medical treatment and that the General Headquarters had sent personnel to take care of him. After investigation, the statement is not true. I am writing to inform you of this and hope that you will make corrections. Sincerely, Military Law Office of the General Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>

<p>I recently read a news item in the Local Communications column of your newspaper on May 9 entitled "Reasons for the Slow Installation of Long-Distance Telephones in Ji County," which does not conform to the facts. After investigation, the installation of long-distance telephones in our county has already begun. Within two months, all districts in the county will be able to make calls. What your newspaper reported is probably based on false rumors. I am writing to inform you of this and request that you make corrections. I will be very grateful.

<p>to the Labor Conference Set Sail Yesterday</p>
<p>The World Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva, Italy on June 10. China is also a member of the conference and is attending the meeting. The conference has sent a telegram urging the dispatch of representatives to attend the meeting. The Central Government has specially appointed Zhu Shikang and Ms. He Xiulan and three others as official representatives. After Zhu and others arrived in Shanghai, they initially planned to take a European ship to France and then transfer to Italy. However, due to the urgency of the meeting, there was only one month left before the opening. If they took a European ship, there would not be enough time to attend the meeting. Therefore, they changed their sea route to go from the Pacific Ocean to the United States and then cross the Atlantic Ocean to Geneva, which would allow them to arrive around June 5th or 6th. Therefore, at 9 a.m. yesterday, the three representatives purchased tickets for the President Madison of the Dollar Steamship Company and boarded the ship at the New Customs Wharf. They departed from the country that day.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Yang Shuzhuang Makes No Indication of Returning to Fujian <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, Minister of the Navy and concurrently Chairman of Fujian Province, arrived in Shanghai last night by express train from Nanjing. He arrived at the North Railway Station yesterday morning. Those who went to the station to greet him included Ren Guangyu, Director of the Naval Affairs Bureau, and Zheng Youyi, a member of the Navy's Special Party Branch. After alighting from the train, Yang immediately took his own car back to his private residence on Avenue Doumer. It is said that Yang's trip to Nanjing was to personally meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Chairman Chiang personally instructed him on how to handle Fujian affairs. Therefore, Yang's firm resignation from the chairmanship of Fujian is no longer a problem. After Yang returned to Shanghai, he has not yet indicated the date of his return to Fujian. He is expected to leave within a few days. The "Pu An Pan," the ship he will be taking, has already been lit up in preparation for departure yesterday. However, it is heard that Navy Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan is still dealing with important official matters. He took the night express train from Nanjing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning to discuss matters with Yang. It is said that Yang may depart after meeting with Chen in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Shigemitsu葵 Scheduled to Return Home <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Traveling East on the Shanghai Maru on the Fourteenth of This Month</p>
<p>The Consul General Will Be Temporarily Represented by Consul Miura</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday that the Japanese government telegraphed Acting Minister Shigemitsu葵 to return home to consult on future negotiation steps with China. It is now known that Shigemitsu has decided to travel east on the Shanghai Maru on the fourteenth of this month with Secretary Lin Chu. He will stay in Tokyo for about a month. During Shigemitsu's absence from Shanghai, the duties of the Japanese Consul General will be temporarily handled by Consul Miura.</p>
<p>The "Great Evening News" reports that Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu may be promoted to full minister. According to diplomatic sources today, the Japanese government is seriously considering this matter. The Japanese Consulate General also claims that Acting Minister Shigemitsu will return to his country within the next week for a stay of more than a month. He may return as acting minister in the future, but it is also impossible to predict. However, the staff of the consulate general mostly believe that he will obtain a permanent position at that time. Since the establishment of the tariff agreement and the completion of preliminary negotiations on consular jurisdiction, Shigemitsu has been deeply trusted by the Japanese government, and Japanese newspapers have repeatedly proposed that he be promoted to minister immediately. In addition, his personality is extremely pleasing to China, and his relationship with the National Government is particularly good. This may also be an important reason for his promotion to minister. It is reported that before returning to his country, Shigemitsu must meet with the newly appointed Ambassador to France, Yoshizawa, who served as the Minister to China for many years. He was recently promoted to ambassador and will take the Hakone Maru to France to take office, passing through Shanghai on Monday.</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Naval Reorganization Office Will Close Today <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Naval Reorganization Office at Gaochang Temple was established in Shanghai in May of last year upon order, and eleven people, including Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Shaokuan, Ling Xiao, Zhang Qun, Huang Xuyu, Chen Jiliang, Wang Lie, Zeng Yiding, and Liu Chuanshou, were appointed as members. It has been almost a year. However, our country's navy is very different from the army. Its strength is weak, and it is not enough to speak of national defense. Therefore, although it is called reorganization, in reality, it is just a little inspection and rectification, and there is no so-called reorganization or dismissal. Moreover, the members hold multiple positions and are often out. Since the Ling and Wang members returned to the Northeast, the routine weekly reorganization committee has not been able to be held as usual. The Central Reorganization Committee has therefore instructed the office to immediately abolish it. After receiving the order, the office decided to complete the closure today (the 10th). In the future, the name of the Naval Headquarters will still be used, and all personnel of the office will still be placed in the headquarters.</p>

<p>British Ships Stop Using Chinese River Pilots</p>
<p>An Unfortunate Piece of News for the Lives of Chinese People</p>
<p>The negotiations between British ships and Chinese river pilots for upriver sailing have broken down. Previously, due to the increasing cost of living, the river pilots requested a raise in salary. The foreign ships then went on strike to deal with the situation. Later, American and Japanese shipping companies negotiated with the river pilots due to business relations and agreed to varying degrees of pay increases. Therefore, American and Japanese upriver ships resumed their routes within the past month, as reported in this newspaper. British companies, such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire, were the most vehement opponents of the pay increase. Later, they were forced by the resumption of routes by Chinese, Japanese, and American ships to seriously consider the impact on their business. They negotiated with the river pilots on the issue of pay increases. After half a month, the British were extremely unwilling to compromise, and there was no opportunity for the labor and management sides to reach an agreement. According to a recent telegram from Yichang, the negotiations have broken down, and the British have indicated that they will temporarily not use Chinese river pilots.</p>
<p>Foreigners Are Cleverly Sailing Ships: Swire has a total of eight ships sailing upstream, and Jardine Matheson also has three. Some ships have been suspended in Shanghai for two months, and some for one month. Recently, because the river water between Yichang and Chongqing has risen greatly, large ships of more than 1,000 tons can pass through. The Sichuan cotton yarn purchasers have telegraphed Shanghai to rush to load and go to Chongqing. China Merchants, Nissin, and Czech companies have all sent large amounts of cargo. Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson are unwilling to give up this great business opportunity. Therefore, the seven large upstream ships in Shanghai have also successively transported yarn to Chongqing since the 4th of this month. However, the Yichang-Chongqing route cannot be sailed without Chinese river pilots. Since the British companies refused the river pilots' demands, they decided that the British shipowners would drive the ships themselves. They first went to Yichang to pick up the goods. On one hand, they secretly hired a Chinese person who was familiar with the Sichuan river routes at a good price to guide the foreign drivers on the first ship. The other ships followed along. Therefore, the British ships did not hire river pilots and were actually able to operate. The Wanxian, Wantong, and Wanliu wheels, which exported the previous and past days, all followed this method.</p>

<p>Since the rise in gold prices, all ferry tickets have taken the opportunity to increase in price. On the Yangtze River route, Butterfield &amp; Swire first proposed to increase the original amount by 10%. For example, the price from Shanghai to Hankou, which was originally 66 yuan, would increase to 72 yuan. Later, Taikoo, China Merchants, etc. did not agree, so this matter was not implemented. Now Nissin Company has also proposed the idea of ​​appropriately increasing ticket prices, and also proposes that future round-trip tickets, which are charged at 70%, should be changed to 100%. Currently, various shipping companies are discussing this. Recently, Yangtze River passenger tickets have become a situation where each company sets its own price because the six companies cannot agree. For example, the first-class passenger fare from Shanghai to Hankou on foreign ships is 66 yuan, while China Merchants Bureau ships only charge 52 yuan, so there is a big difference.</p>

<p>Telegram Requesting Postponement of Cocoon Donation Security Fee</p>
<p>Huang Jinzhin, Chairman of the Jiangzhewan Silk Cocoon General Office, telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday: "Zhang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, recently learned that the 308th Provincial Affairs Conference of the Zhejiang Provincial Government resolved to collect a security fee of 10% from this year's cocoon donation. The merchants were shocked to hear this. The Zhejiang Province's original cocoon donation is already heavily burdened. The merchants have fulfilled their tax obligations, and the government should have security responsibilities. Now, a new name has been established and a surcharge has been added. At a time when silk prices have fallen sharply and the silk cocoon industry is extremely difficult, it is really unable to bear it. It is requested that your general office submit a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to cancel the surcharge to stabilize the cocoon industry. Based on this, the Zhejiang Province's cocoon donation is already about 50% of the tax in addition to the regular tax of 8 yuan. Various surcharges have been added for a long time without being removed. The merchant's power is dwindling and they are already struggling to bear it. In the government's collection of donations and taxes, it should fulfill its responsibility to protect commerce, not to increase the security fee under the cocoon donation. In recent years, the cost of cocoons has been high and the price of silk has been low, resulting in years of losses and a difficult situation. If an exceptional surcharge is added to raw silk materials, it is tantamount to accelerating its demise. Jiahu is a more prosperous area for silk cocoons and should maintain its vitality to relieve cocoon production. According to the previous situation, it is no wonder that they are panic-stricken. It is specially telegraphed to humbly request the president to consider that the cocoon tax is heavy and to strive for the benefit of the hometown, and to postpone the implementation of the 10% security fee added to the cocoon donation to sympathize with farmers and merchants and relieve the people's power. I am extremely eager to await orders and hope for approval and instructions, which is a public convenience."</p>

<p>The International Radio Station Will Be Powered by Zhabei</p>
<p>The Public Utilities Bureau Approved the Handling</p>
<p>The preparatory office of the International Communications Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications is constructing the International Wireless Radio Station in front of the Jinwang Temple in Shuangshier Tu, Zhenru. The radio station requires a large amount of power for its transmitting station, reaching 500 kilowatts. The local Zhenru Electric Company is small in scale and sells electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, so it is unable to supply it directly and voluntarily waives this business right. The office then negotiated with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to undertake it and agreed to advance the company 50,000 yuan for installation and construction costs, which will be deducted from the electricity bill each month in the future. The company did not dare to specialize because the matter was outside the scope of the power supply business area and requested the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to review and instruct. It is now known that the bureau has approved its temporary power supply, but in the future</p>
<p>If there is another registered electrical company in the area, all the company's power supply equipment in the area will be taken back at a price, and it will be ordered to submit the contract concluded with the radio station for filing.</p>

Years of famine have caused great panic. If the profiteers are allowed to manipulate the situation and the sources are cut off, the people's hearts will become more floating, which is a great concern for the locality. The government should consider the people's food and find ways to remedy the situation, and also consult the Jiangxi Provincial Government to allow circulation and transportation to stabilize the people and eliminate the rice famine. At the same time, it also telegraphed the Jiangxi Provincial Government, asking them not to curb the situation, treat everyone equally, and allow circulation and purchase.</p>

<p>"I am old and no longer have the vigor of my youth. My coming to Shanghai this time is to escort the remains of my children to be buried in the Rainbow Bridge Township Cemetery. Speaking of which, it is inevitable to make people feel sad." Yesterday, the reporter visited Sun Juxian, the ninety-year-old opera actor known as "Elderly Compatriot," at the Yipinxiang Hotel and asked about his feelings on coming to Shanghai this time. He replied as above. The setting sun is fading, times have changed, and savoring the words of the "Elderly Compatriot," it seems impossible not to sigh with regret. Sun Juxian, from Tianjin, entered the opera world as a famous amateur and became a leader in the industry for sixty years. Empress Dowager Cixi of the late Qing Dynasty admired his art and selected him to be a court performer, living in the palace for eighteen years. Throughout his life, he was praised for his philanthropy and extraordinary spirit, different from the common customs. People respected him for his age and reputation, and dared not call him by his name. The three words "Elderly Compatriot" are a sign of respect. This time, he came to Shanghai to bury his descendants and will stay for a while. His friends invited him to share his unique artistry with the people of Shanghai, and thus there is a proposal for him to perform on the Shanghai stage. The reporter believes that it is a rare opportunity for this old man to come south. It is more than just an anecdote in the opera world for a nonagenarian to put on makeup and appear on stage. Therefore, the reporter went to visit him. The "Elderly Compatriot" is currently staying in room 15 of the Yipinxiang Hotel. He arrived in Shanghai on the 4th of this month by taking the Tongzhou wheel from Tianjin and arrived here at around 9:00 a.m. Those who knew Mr. Sun in the past went to chat with him. The reporter visited him last night at around 8:00 p.m. A fellow villager of his was talking to the "Elderly Compatriot" about matters since their separation. Although Mr. Sun is ninety years old, he does not show obvious signs of decline. He has a handful of white beard, both whiskers as white as frost, and looks like someone in his seventies. He wears a black robe and a coral-knotted casual hat. When entering the room, he bows with both hands, showing great respect. He holds a black pipe that is about three feet long and smokes a lot of tobacco after sitting down. When talking, his voice is loud and clear, coming from his dantian. However, he is deaf, and guests must speak loudly to him. The reporter exchanged pleasantries with him and asked about the purpose of his trip before proceeding with the following conversation.</p>
<p>(Question) How many times have you been to Shanghai before? (Answer) How many times? I can't remember anymore. I came to Shanghai sixty years ago when I was thirty years old and founded the Shengping Theater. Later, it closed due to heavy losses, so I returned north. This was my first time in Shanghai. (Question) It is extremely rare for the "Elderly Compatriot" to be ninety years old. Can you tell us your birth date? Upon hearing this, Sun Juxian suddenly opened his mouth and laughed at the reporter, saying, "I was born in the 21st year of the Daoguang Emperor of the former Qing Dynasty, isn't it ninety years ago? If you ask about my birthday, I don't need to remember it myself because the whole world celebrates my birthday!" At this point, he laughed even louder, seeming extremely happy in his heart. The reporter eagerly asked him for details. The "Elderly Compatriot" said, "To tell you the truth, my birthday is on the eve of the twelfth lunar month. Isn't it a time when candles are burning high, banquets are in full swing, and every family is celebrating the New Year, celebrating the birthday of this old man?" The reporter listened to his words and couldn't help but clap his hands in admiration, feeling that this old man still had the heart of a child and that it was indeed a sign of longevity. So, the reporter asked if he had any unique methods of maintaining health or any special ways to preserve youth. Mr. Sun replied, "I have no unique secret to maintaining health. However, I liked to practice martial arts when I was young, and as I grew older, I studied archery. I often exercised my muscles and bones. Perhaps that is why I am so healthy today." Later, the reporter chatted about trivial matters and then took his leave. The conversation lasted for about ten minutes, and the old man coughed only once or twice. His spirit was vigorous, and he did not deceive us.</p>

<p>Su Zuyan, a local teacher at Shanghai Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road, west of the South Gate in the Nanshi district, was divorced from his wife, Ms. Li, due to her fierceness and repeated abuse. He had filed a complaint with the local court last year, and a divorce was granted. The details were reported in this newspaper. However, Ms. Li was not satisfied and repeatedly provoked Mr. Su. Because Mr. Su was a professor and wanted to save face, he would avoid her whenever he heard that Ms. Li was coming. Ms. Li, angered and ashamed, searched for Mr. Su's address again and again. Almost all the officers in the 2nd Precinct of the Public Security Bureau recognized Ms. Li. After separating from Mr. Su, Ms. Li lived with relatives in No. 7 Zhilan Lane on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, but she never forgot about Mr. Su. Yesterday at around 12:00 noon, Ms. Li and several female friends and neighbors hired a car from the Fuxing Automobile Company on Route Mareschal Joffre and drove directly to Minli Middle School. They rushed into the school, demanding that Mr. Su come out to talk. At that time, Mr. Gu Gongliang, a close friend of Mr. Su (also a teacher at Minli Middle School), heard the news and came out to stop Ms. Li from entering the school. However, when Ms. Li saw Mr. Gu, she became even more enraged. During the court hearing last year, Mr. Gu was the most powerful witness, testifying that he had personally seen Ms. Li slapping Mr. Su several times during a fight with his friends and that he had denounced Ms. Li as fierce and strongly advocated for a divorce. Therefore, Ms. Li hated Mr. Gu even more than an enemy. Before a word could be said, the women's army launched a full-scale attack, striking out with their hands and shouting insults. Mr. Gu Gongliang was helpless and was quickly beaten, suffering injuries to his head, back, and sides. For a time, the streets of Zhonghua Road were jammed with spectators, and more than ten trams were stopped. There were many students at Minli, and seeing their teacher being attacked, they wanted to come to his aid, but were afraid of causing a disaster because of gender relations. They had to report to the nearby police and send a telegram to the 2nd Precinct of the Public Security Bureau for help. Chief Meng heard the news and immediately ordered an inspector to lead several police officers to the scene. When they saw Ms. Li, whom they recognized instantly, they understood the situation without asking and took her and the car to the precinct. Chief Meng had just taken office and was meeting Ms. Li for the first time. He was about to ask for her age and address when a police officer replied, "She is 24 years old, a local, and used to live in Xinchengli nearby." He said it without thinking because Ms. Li had been brought to the precinct for fighting with Mr. Su more than once, so they were very familiar with her. The neighbors and friends who came with her were questioned. One identified herself as Ms. Li Xue, 40 years old, a local, living at No. 7 Zhilan Lane in the French Concession. Another identified herself as Ms. Liu Li, 42 years old, living with Ms. Li Xue and assisting in the crime. The driver identified himself as Wang Guixun, 27 years old, from Ningbo. Mr. Gu Gongliang, 26 years old, from Kunshan, gave a detailed account of Ms. Li's provocative behavior. After obtaining the statements, Chief Meng considered the matter to involve personal affairs and immediately prepared a document to transfer the case to the court for review.</p>

In March, Lü hired lawyer Ye Fukang to sue Zhang Weiyong, Wu Xibai, and guarantor La Wenyuan in the Former Provisional Court for failing to repay 50,000 taels of silver in two loans.</p>
<p>The first loan was for 20,000 taels. According to the indictment, in July of last year, Wu exchanged three China Citizen Bank cashier's checks for 15,000 taels of cash from Lü. When the checks were due, he failed to pay the money. After Lü repeatedly demanded payment, Wu finally pledged his own 20,000 tael shares in the bank and a property deed and sales contract for a plot of land in Shangyi, Bao 25, under the name of Cao Jixun, as collateral on October 16th. He also had La Wenyuan guarantee the loan of 20,000 taels, and a contract was signed with a redemption date of December 31st.</p>
<p>The second loan was for 30,000 taels. On December 1st, Wu told Lü that to maintain the bank's business, he needed to borrow another 30,000 taels. Otherwise, the bank would not be able to operate and would have to close down, and the previous loan of 20,000 taels would also be lost. Lü had to agree to his request. Wu and Zhang, representing the bank, jointly signed a document stating that the bank's business rights, property rights, registration certificate, and all its movable and immovable property would be used as collateral, also with a redemption date at the end of the year. However, at the due date, no money was repaid.</p>
<p>Separate Lawsuits for Repayment. After Lü's investigation, apart from a valid land deed under the name of Cao Ji Dong, the other collateral was worthless. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. For the first loan of 20,000 taels, he requested the court to order Wu Xibai to repay the money and hold the guarantor La Wenyuan jointly and severally liable. For the second loan of 30,000 taels, he requested the court to order Wu Xibai and Zhang Weiyong to jointly repay the money.</p>
<p>Wu and Zhang Arrested and Detained. They also declared that Wu and Zhang were at risk of fleeing. The plaintiff was willing to provide 20,000 taels of cash as bail and requested that the two defendants be arrested and detained. As a result, Zhang Weiyong and Wu Xibai, who had both served as chairmen of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, were detained. The bank initially continued to operate until it was unable to sustain itself and declared liquidation a few days ago.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff Was Once the Bank's President. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by Judge Xu Wenrong of the Special District Court. The three defendants each hired lawyers to defend them. The plaintiff first stated the circumstances of the two loans, presented the loan documents and letters as evidence, and denied holding the position of president of the bank. According to the testimony of defendant Zhang Weiyong, the plaintiff denied holding the position of president after taking office because he could not implement his plans for personal gain. However, all the important keys to the bank were still in his hands, and two of his close associates only resigned when the lawsuit was about to be filed. While he was president, depositors who tried to withdraw money were not only denied payment but also insulted. He is currently being sued in the French Concession, and so on. He also presented the bank's business books and delivery books signed by the plaintiff to prove that Lü was indeed the president of the bank.</p>
<p>Fraudulent Registration to Deceive. The debate began. First, lawyer Ye stated that the bank was established before raising funds and claimed to be registered with the Hong Kong government. However, according to the British Companies Act passed by the British Parliament after 1928, it must be registered with the local consulate to be recognized as a British company. The bank did not register with the British Consulate in Shanghai and was actually fraudulently deceiving people.</p>
<p>Wu Should Repay 20,000 Taels. If the plaintiff was indeed the president, there should be letters of appointment, etc. The delivery book is not sufficient evidence. His signature on the bank's business books is because the loan document states that the business rights are also within the scope of the collateral. The defendants specifically invited Lü to the bank and colluded with people to deposit a small amount of money to make Lü sign, to strengthen his belief that the bank did indeed have depositors and to use it as bait to borrow money. The wording of the 20,000 tael loan clearly indicates that it was Wu's personal loan, so Wu should repay it, and La should bear the responsibility of guarantee. The 30,000 tael loan should be jointly repaid by Wu and Zhang, and overdue interest should be paid.</p>
<p>The Question of the President's Responsibility. The defendants' lawyers then argued, first stating that the amount of the loan did not match, indicating that there was an inside story. Next, they discussed the issue of responsibility and requested that the plaintiff was actually the president of the bank and that all the bank's accounts were stored in the vault, with the keys still in the plaintiff's possession. They requested that he hand them over so that the books could be retrieved for investigation, which would clarify the exact amount of the loan and its use.</p>
<p>Agreed to Consulate Investigation. They also agreed with the plaintiff's lawyer's request to investigate with the British Consulate, saying that this would not only resolve the dispute over whether it was registered with the British Consulate but also prove whether the plaintiff was a shareholder of the bank.</p>
<p>The Debate Was Declared Concluded. After the debate, the defendants' lawyers raised two more points: (1) Zhang and Wu have been detained for two months, causing great losses to the bank, leading to its closure. The right to claim damages should be reserved. (2) Please release the defendants. Judge Xu ruled that the debate on the case was concluded and that the sentencing would be scheduled for the morning of May 12. The defendants Zhang Weiyong and Wu Xibai were returned to custody and ordered to provide bail pending approval for release on bail.</p>

<p>The Special District Court Opens Trial</p>
<p>六十萬大騙案</p>
<p>600,000 Dollar Fraud Case</p>
<p>最初放印子錢於妓寮</p>
<p>Initially Loaned Money at High Interest to Brothels</p>
<p>貪厚息存户逐漸增多</p>
<p>Depositors Gradually Increased Due to Greed for High Interest</p>
<p>付息金多至四十六萬</p>
<p>Interest Payments Reached 460,000</p>
<p>法院淸理被告之財產</p>
<p>The Court Liquidates the Defendant's Assets</p>
<p>Yang Shulin, a native of Hebei who previously served as a patrol officer in the Fourth District Police Department in Zhabei, falsely established a company in the name of running a real business after resigning from his public service position, defrauding people of a huge amount of 600,000 dollars in deposits. The case has been reported in this newspaper. The cause of this massive fraud was due in part to those who were greedy for high interest rates.</p>
<p>Delivering Interest House to House. Yang initially started by lending money at high interest, mostly to brothels on Sima Road, to be used as basic capital for the prostitution business, charging a monthly interest rate of six cents. As the number of borrowers increased, Yang's capital became limited. Therefore, he had a whimsical idea and re-lent the money to others, luring them with high interest rates, giving them five cents per month. At the time of interest payments, he sent people to deliver the money house to house. As a result, greedy and contemptible people, blinded by greed, successively deposited money with him, eventually losing both principal and interest. Although some had received a little interest money, it was still not worth the loss.</p>
<p>Complex Depositor Base. There are a total of one thousand depositors, with a complex mix of educated people, government employees, businessmen, women, and male and female laborers. They have now formed a creditors' group, initially handled by lawyer Ye Fukang. However, only a few people registered with Ye. Later, it was changed to be handled by lawyers Xu Bingcheng and Xu Fuji, father and son. More than 390 people have registered with Xu.</p>
<p>Deposits Accumulated More and More. Xu was originally the legal advisor of the Wenji Company established by Yang and is now representing the creditors of the company and filing a lawsuit on behalf of the creditors. The complaint describes in detail that the defendant Yang Shulin founded the Hexing Company in the Bingyin year, established the Wenji Company in the Dingmao year, and then successively established more than a dozen branches. Seeing the increasing number of branches and the expansion of business, the old depositors, in addition to receiving official interest, also received bonuses. As a result, the news spread, and more and more people believed in him, and the deposits increased more and more.</p>
<p>His Concubine is Still at Large. After Yang falsely claimed to have been kidnapped on February 14 of this year, the creditors initially believed it to be true and publicly elected Gu Zhuxuan and Cao Youshan to try to maintain the situation. At this time, it was discovered that the deposits of each household reached more than 600,000. While registering and liquidating, they suddenly received news that Yang Cunyang had been detained in Tianjin. The depositors realized that Yang had malicious intentions. Cao sent someone to Tianjin to accompany him back to Shanghai to try to remedy the situation. Unexpectedly, after returning to Shanghai, he kept delaying and fabricating accounts. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, Yang and his concubine Chen Huanxi were about to flee together. Fortunately, He Qiqing was captured first. After he revealed the hiding place, Yang was subsequently arrested, but his concubine is still at large.</p>
<p>Requesting Strict Arrest of Yang's Concubine. The money Yang defrauded was mostly from the autumn and winter seasons of last year, amounting to 360,000 to 370,000. When he was detained in Tianjin, his concubine revealed the truth, saying that the kidnapping was a lie and that she had moved the suitcases to hide them. Therefore, Yang's concubine was actually colluding with him. It is requested that she be strictly arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<p>The Falsely Claimed Kidnapping Money Should Be Recovered. Also, Yang sent two letters from Tianjin, saying that he was carrying 52,000 dollars in cash when he was kidnapped. Now that the kidnapping claim has been proven to be false, Yang should be ordered to hand over the money.</p>
<p>The Bad Debts Are Obviously Fabricated. Also, in the business statement made by Yang, the third item shows 51,290 dollars in bad debts from Bingyin to Gengwu. However, after searching the account books, there is no such record. It is obviously fabricated and should also be ordered to be handed over by Yang first. There are many other inconsistencies in the accounts. It is requested that a detailed investigation be conducted before severely punishing Yang.</p>
<p>The Branches Have No Scale. The statement mentions that there are more than a dozen branches, referring to the Wenji Bee Company, the Prida Steel Factory, the Health Vegetable</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Garden, the Hexing Money Shop, the Hexing Gold Shop, the Heshengyong, the Hesheng, etc., in addition to the Hexing and Wenji Companies. However, after examining the reality, it is truly laughable. The so-called steel factory is actually an iron shop, and the health vegetable garden is a rented piece of land in a remote area of Zhabei, used as a vegetable garden to grow and sell vegetables. As for the Hexing Gold Shop and the Hexing Money Shop, the capital is very small. The others are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>More Than 300 People Arrived in Court. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard by Judge Sun Yuan of the Special District Court in the Third Courtroom. The two defendants, Yang Shulin and He Qiqing, were ordered to be brought before the court for interrogation. No less than 300 male and female creditors arrived, and their litigation representatives were Cao Youshan, Ge Qingshan, Zhu Shuo, Zheng Qiongji, Shi Youhui, Zhu Qishi, Dong Zhihe, Lu Yushan, Yang Haigen, Wang Zhongji, Shang Decheng, Liu Ziying, and 12 others. First, the 12 people stated the amount of their deposits, and some presented deposit receipts. This deposit was neither a deposit book nor a deposit slip, and its form was similar to a loan document.</p>
<p>Yang Shulin's Testimony. According to the interrogation of defendant Yang Shulin by Judge Sun, Wenji was opened in the seventh year and initially only loaned money at high interest, charging six cents. It was not until the twelfth year that it began to absorb deposits and give five cents interest. Most of the depositors were introduced by friends. By the fifteenth year, there were more and more depositors. In the seventeenth year, the government issued an order prohibiting the exploitation of high interest, and I planned to change my ways and started a real business. At the end of last year, I was unable to pay the five cents interest and changed it to three cents. The depositors then rushed to withdraw their money, and it was impossible to maintain the situation. I had to falsely claim to have been kidnapped and fled to Tianjin. But I have no property in my hometown. All the interest I paid to the depositors has receipts that can be checked.</p>
<p>460,000 in Interest Payments. He then described the locations of each branch and the amount of capital and the name of the manager in each place. He said that the total capital of its branches was less than 50,000. Most of the managers were idle people from the police force. Judge Sun sternly questioned him about how he used such a huge amount of money. Yang then claimed that the amount of money released was about 320,000, and the amount of interest paid was more than 460,000, all of which could be checked in the accounts.</p>
<p>The Runner is Still Confused. He Qiqing was then interrogated. According to his testimony, he worked as a runner for the Hexing Company. Hexing specialized in discounted bills of exchange, and Wenji Company was engaged in lending money at high interest. He is an illiterate fool and seems to be unaware of Yang's fraudulent behavior. He firmly claimed that the discounted bills of exchange he released could be collected from the issuer. He still did not know that Yang had already collected the bills from the issuer after they were due. After a long interrogation, Judge Sun ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody for further investigation and decided to have the court appoint someone to be responsible for the liquidation of the defendant's property because it was an important matter.</p>

<p>Sale of Shatin to Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Texaco's Land Purchase for Oil Tank Construction Sparks Repercussions</p>
<p>Jiang Ruchun, manager of Yongxing Real Estate Company, bought more than 200 mu of Shatin land at Takahashi Sands (i.e., Mouse Sands) and sold it to the foreign merchant Texaco for the purpose of building oil tanks. The residents of Shatin believe that Jiang Ruchun disregards the people's livelihood, is greedy for huge profits, calls it a lease, but it is actually a bill of sale, selling off national territory, benefiting himself and harming the people. Nothing could be worse. They specially gathered two or three hundred residents a few days ago to hold a meeting at Shatin. Lu Wenbiao, Xu Yunlong, Huang Wenxiang, Zhong Youliang, Gu Quan, and others were publicly elected as representatives. They spoke and discussed on the spot, investigating that the document issued by the Ministry of Finance for the land had a stamp indicating that it must not be sold to persons of non-Chinese nationality. Now Jiang of Yongxing Company is selling the land to foreign merchants to build oil tanks, which is obviously a violation of national law and harms the people's livelihood. They should, according to law, sue the national government to severely investigate the lawless and treacherous villains and confiscate the land, striving to achieve the goal. It was decided to adjourn the meeting immediately.</p>

<p>The Murderer is Indeed Hou Genbao</p>
<p>Inverted While Catching Toads</p>
<p>The case of Mao Da, the 13-year-old nephew of villager Guan Liukun, who was buried alive, has been reported in this newspaper twice. The murderer, Hou Genbao, was arrested yesterday by the Criminal Investigation Team of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei. It is reported that after the incident, Hou hid in his sister's house. At around 11 o'clock the night before, he was seen by his two brothers near Wangjiajing. They tricked him to Jiaotong Road and reported it to the Public Security Bureau for arrest, so he did not escape. After preliminary interrogation by the Criminal Investigation Team, it was confirmed that he was the murderer. Yesterday evening, Hou Yaokun, a suspect, was also arrested. Whether he is related to this case remains to be interrogated. It is further reported that after digging the pit, the murderer threw a toad into the pit and then lured Mao Da to catch it, pushing him down headfirst, causing him to die. He then used a hammer to hit his head, causing him to lose consciousness, it is said.</p>

<p>The case of the roulette gambling den at No. 230 Kang Nao Tuo Road, which was built across the border of the Public Concession and cracked down by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has been reported in this newspaper three times in detail. In addition to all the gamblers and roulette gambling equipment being fined and confiscated separately, there were also six cars that were seized together. It was originally intended to confiscate them all to show a warning. Later, because most of them were cars prepared by the gamblers themselves or borrowed from relatives and friends, special accommodation was made. Except for Public Concession No. 3758 (City No. 201), Public Concession No. 3307 (City No. 2382), and French Concession No. 11536, etc., three vehicles have been claimed by the car owners yesterday morning. There are still three vehicles, Concession No. 2037 (City No. 921) and Concession No. 2858 (City No. 5511), etc., which are still detained at the Public Security Bureau as of last night. It is reported that one of these three vehicles is prepared by the gambling den itself, specially for picking up and dropping off gamblers. It is heard that it will be confiscated.</p>

<p>How Many Husbands Can One Woman Marry?</p>
<p>The Inside Story of Divorce</p>
<p>In Hongjialong, West City, Sanlintang, Pudong, there is a Hong Guixiang, who is a shoemaker. His family is well-off, and he has only two daughters. The elder one is married and lives with her husband's family. The younger daughter, nicknamed Guifan, is now twenty years old. Three years ago, he recruited Lu Bingquan to his home as his son-in-law, originally planning to get married in July this year. Now Hong Guifan believes that her fiancé Lu Bingquan does not obey her father's teachings and is dissatisfied. She asked someone to write a petition to the local court, requesting to terminate the engagement. The defendant, Lu Bingquan, hired lawyer Zhang Qingyue to file a defense. Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, Judge Zhao Zhenhai specially opened the second court for trial. First, the plaintiff Hong Guifan testified, "I am twenty years old, from Shanghai, and live in Hongjialong, Sanlintang, Pudong." (Question) "What are you requesting?" (Answer) "Request to terminate the engagement." (Question) "When did you get engaged?" (Answer) "About five or six years ago." (Question) "Who made the decision?" (Answer) "My parents made the decision." (Question) "Who was the matchmaker?" (Answer) "Someone surnamed Cai." (Question) "Did your parents ask you when you got engaged?" (Answer) "No." (Question) "How many years has Lu Bingquan been in your house?" (Answer) "Three years." At this point, lawyer Zhang spoke up, "The engagement was made on the tenth day of the first month of the lunar calendar in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the defendant Lu Bingquan came to the door, commonly known as a 'male daughter-in-law.' Please pay attention to the plaintiff's age, Your Honor. Although she is nominally twenty years old this year, she is actually only nineteen years old and has not reached the legal age." The judge then (asked) "When is the plaintiff's birthday?" Guifan (replied) "I was born on the twenty-fifth day of the first month." The judge said, "Then you are indeed not yet twenty years old. It must be postponed until the twenty-fifth day of the first month next year to be legal." (Answer) "In our village, we count one year older after the new year." (Question) "Does your father know about this lawsuit?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Since you didn't want to, why didn't you object at the time?" (Answer) "I didn't know his personality at the time. After he came to the door, my father taught him how to make a living (referring to making shoes), but he refused to do it and ran away, and said that he didn't want me to be his wife." (Question) "Was there any evidence when Lu Bingquan came to the door?" ( ) "Yes, it's at my father's place." The judge ordered Lu Bingquan to the case to testify. He is twenty years old, from Shanghai, lives in Sanlintang, and is now a partner in Jiang Wansheng Rice Store in Xieqiao. (Question) "The plaintiff is requesting to terminate the engagement. What do you think?" (Answer) "I don't want to. I must have her." (Question) "Who made the decision in your family when you got engaged?" (Answer) "My elder brother Jinquan made the decision." (Question) "What about the woman's family?" (Answer) "My father-in-law and mother-in-law made the decision." (Question) "Are you and her on good terms?" (Answer) "Yes." (Question) "Is it true that you don't listen to her father's words?" (Answer) "I listen." (Question) "Why doesn't she want you?" (Answer) "They beat me out." (Question) "Why doesn't your father-in-law like you?" (Answer) "Because I don't make shoes with my father-in-law, so he doesn't like me. But everyone has their own ambitions. I want to work in the rice industry. Besides, I used to learn the trade at Suilong Rice Store, and my monthly salary was eight yuan. Because it was not enough to cover expenses, I have now been transferred to Jiang Wansheng Rice Store in Xieqiao as a partner, with a monthly salary of fourteen yuan," etc. According to Hong Guixiang's testimony, she is fifty-one years old. "When I betrothed my daughter Guifan in the past, she was only sixteen years old. I have tried to persuade my daughter about this lawsuit, but she refused." (Question) "What's wrong with Lu Bingquan?" (Answer) "He used to learn at a rice store. After he came to the door, I taught him to make shoes, but he didn't listen to me and ran away." (Question) "How much money can you earn each month making shoes?" (Answer) "About twenty yuan." The judge said, "Now the court orders the defendant to make shoes with you and listen to you. How about that?" (Answer) "His personality is inherent, how can it be changed?" Then the judge said to the defendant, "How about you still make shoes with your father-in-law?" (Answer) "I have hope in the rice industry. If I go to make shoes, there is no future. I cannot agree." At this point, lawyer Zhang said, "Since the defendant came to the door, he has been deceived by the plaintiff's father out of 210 yuan and a gold ring. Now the defendant has no money, so the plaintiff doesn't want the defendant. However, there is a dark side to this kind of recruiting a son-in-law. There have been as many as six fiancés recruited by the plaintiff, including the defendant. It is worth studying." Lawyer Zhang then presented a list of the plaintiff's previous fiancés to the case for review. (1. Yao Sheng, son of Gao Qiutang; 2. Qiu Jian, son of Wang Gengsheng; 3. Nephew of Zhang Arong, name unknown; 4. Grand-nephew of Qu Muquan, name unknown; 5. Xue Yu, son of Qiao Xuelin.) After reading it, the judge asked Hong, "Is this true?" (Answer) "Yes, there are only two sons of Gao Qiutang. Because there are adopted sons and apprentices, they all refer to them as my son-in-law, which is too much." The defendant said, "There are actually six people. Yao Sheng, son of Gao Qiutang, was in the eighth year of the Republic of China; Qiu Jian, son of Wang Gengsheng, was in the tenth year of the Republic of China; Zhang Arong's nephew was in the eleventh year of the Republic of China; Qu Muquan's grand-nephew was in the twelfth year of the Republic of China; Xue Yu, son of Qiao Xuelin, was in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China; I was in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China." The judge obtained the testimony and mediated on the spot, persuading the plaintiff to withdraw the lawsuit. The plaintiff refused and insisted on terminating the engagement. The judge said, "Words cannot be spoken casually. Besides, you are betrothed to too many people, and the reputation is not good." Lawyer Zhang also said, "The defendant was originally scheduled to get married in July this year, and now there is a seventh person behind the scenes, so there is this lawsuit," etc. The judge learned the truth and said to Hong Guifan, "If you want to terminate the engagement, you must compensate the defendant 210 yuan, otherwise, there is only a judgment according to law." The plaintiff replied that she had no money. The judge ordered that there would be no debate, and ordered both parties to go outside for mediation. If the mediation failed, they would convene again for trial, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Transferred for 160 Yuan</p>
<p>Mother-in-Law Learns of it and is Infuriated</p>
<p>Xiao Meimei, the daughter of Feng Xie, a woman in Xintou Lane, Northwest Shanghai, is 26 years old this year. Four years ago, she married Yan Xiaodi, a farmer. Yan has a scabby head and an extremely ugly appearance. The relationship between the couple is like ice and charcoal, and they often fight. In April last year, the couple quarreled again. Xiao Meimei left in a fit of anger. When she arrived at Xujiahui, it was already dusk and there was nowhere to stay. Ai Bingkui, a farmer from Aijiazhai there, struck up a conversation. Because his parents were both dead and he had no wife, this unexpected encounter was a match made in heaven. He led her home and they engaged in illicit relations. From then on, Xiao Meimei was in charge of the Ai family's cooking and housekeeping. Soon, the news spread, and Yan Xiaodi learned about it. He went to the Ai family to negotiate. Ai's aunt, Jin, and Ai negotiated with Yan to pay 160 yuan as the price for the body. Yan Xiaodi agreed and wrote a document transferring his wife. After Yan Xiaodi got 160 yuan and returned home, he had used it all up in a year. He had no more money, and because his mother-in-law Feng Xie had not yet known about it, he could not bear the burden if the secret was leaked. So, as a preemptive measure, he often went to Feng Xie's place to inquire about his wife's whereabouts. The woman originally thought that her daughter had really escaped, so she agreed to ask someone to look for her. Later, she was reported that Yan Xiaodi had sold his wife himself. The woman was furious and rushed to Yan's house the day before yesterday, taking Yan to the Sixth District First Sub-bureau. A senior police officer was then dispatched to bring Ai Bingkui and Jin Ai to the station. Yesterday, together with the plaintiff, they were transferred to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Will Auction Luggage of Detained Chinese</p>
<p>Since Japan strictly prohibits Chinese laborers from going to Japan, how many thousands of people have been deported back to Shanghai in the past? Some of them were unable to pay the fare and had their luggage detained and stored in the Nisshin Yūsen warehouse at No. 3 North Yangzi Road in this port. It has gradually accumulated like a mountain, some of which have been overdue for too long and have become moldy. Now, because the Nisshin Yūsen has no way to collect them and it is hindering the good things, it has been auctioning off the broken luggage of Chinese people who have been held for fare to old goods dealers for days. At the same time, it has also set a new rule that any Chinese who take a boat to Japan must pay 40 yuan in advance as a deposit for the fare before they will sell a boat ticket, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Hankou Road <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>One-Way Traffic Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Regulations to be Determined After Three Months</p>
<p>All the shops on Hankou Road previously stated that the implementation of one-way traffic had greatly affected business. They had sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpaying Chinese Association to request its cancellation. It is now learned that the Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Public Works Department yesterday, which stated: "The Bureau's intention in taking this measure is purely for the public interest. The Bureau's view is that the interests of a few people, no matter who these few people are, can never outweigh the interests of the general public. Therefore, although the merchants on Hankou Road may feel inconvenience, the Bureau has a compassionate heart and is unwilling to cancel this one-way traffic regulation. It should be implemented as usual within the stipulated three months (starting from April 1). After the three months expire, the Bureau will then determine whether the one-way traffic method on Hankou Road should be continued based on the advantages and disadvantages seen during this trial period. As for the alleged inconvenience felt by merchants, I believe that if given time and implemented for a long time, this inconvenience will gradually decrease. As this regulation has been known to the public, it will surely enable those who drive on this road to go to their destination from the appropriate direction. In all major cities, the one-way traffic method and the "no right turn" regulation are becoming increasingly necessary. This is because the traffic of vehicles is increasing day by day, and this is not enough to manage their actions and facilitate their travel. Assuming that the restrictions of the rules are enough to cause inconvenience to pedestrians and operators in this location, they guarantee the safety of the majority, increase the convenience of the majority, and promote the smooth and unobstructed traffic of the entire street market. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages, the importance cannot be discussed on the same day. In these major cities, it is almost impossible for pedestrians to go to a place in the commercial area and want to reach the door directly by vehicle, and vehicles often park far away and must get out of the car to walk, it is said.</p>

<p>Qin Ci Yang Dian Temple in the eastern head of Lujia Ferry, Pudong, is an ancient temple for many years. The prosperity of the incense in the past was the crown of all temples in Pudong. Ladies and gentlemen from Puxi who went to worship were in endless streams. Last year, due to the murder case of the Shen family, who was in charge of the temple, the authorities sealed it up. Now it is heard that the local officials and gentry believe that the temple has been around for a long time. Considering the meaning of preserving the ancients, it is not convenient to abolish it suddenly. Moreover, the way of teaching by the gods is also a way to save and correct people's hearts. Therefore, Tang Jinghuan, the director of the Second Institute of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, informed the authorities to open the temple, and recommended several impartial gentlemen in Pudong, such as Shen Xingyuan, Liu Jiyun, Sheng Maoxiang, Pan Zuoren, Wang Jifu, Pan Zhiwen, Chen Yuxin, Zhang Qiwen, Qu Shaoyi, etc., as committee members, to be open to everything, and to plan to rebuild the temple, in order to make it焕然一新, and to facilitate good men and women to go and發撝信敎自由之眞諦. It is now learned that the municipal government has approved it and decided to hold the reception by the committee in the temple at 3 pm on the 18th of this month, it is said.</p>

<p>Dismantling of Reed Shed Vegetable Market on Hengtong Road</p>
<p>The Hengtong Road base in the southeast corner of the Gonghe Road vegetable market in Zhabei, this port, has been used by Linji Company to erect reed mat bamboo fences and set up vegetable stalls. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that these reed fences are not only unsightly but also prone to fire. It has notified the owner to dismantle and rebuild them. Later, the owner requested a postponement due to the lease period. When the lease period expired, the bureau repeatedly urged them to do so, but they failed to comply. It is now ordered to dismantle and rebuild them within a limited time, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Case of Fraudulent Claim of May 30th Compensation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Sends a Letter Requesting Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Urges Justice</p>
<p>The families of the martyrs of the May 30th Massacre in Shanghai stated that Li Ruiqing, Wang Zhaohua (i.e., Wang Daohua), and He Hanwen (i.e., He Shaoqing), employees of the small Shadujing Cotton Mill, instructed someone to impersonate Luo Wenlang, the family member of Luo Wenzhao, and colluded with Zhichengtai Tea House at No. 152 Maode Road, Xiaoshadu, to forge evidence to impersonate Luo Wenlang, the family member of Luo Wenzhao, and stamped and guaranteed to fraudulently claim 2,000 yuan in compensation from the association. They then instructed someone to impersonate Hu Changsheng, a representative of the association, to Luo Wenlang's residence, saying that Luo's compensation was only 500 yuan and that 260 yuan for travel expenses had to be deducted, leaving only 240 yuan for Luo. After the case was revealed, the association hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to sue Li, Wang, and He and Zhichengtai Tea House in the Special Zone Local Court. The court had already held a trial on the sixth day. Due to the lack of witnesses, the trial was adjourned. However, the fairy scene of this case is already very clear. Yesterday, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Board of Directors of the May 30th Cemetery, sent a special letter to Wu Chengyu, the acting lawyer of the families association, requesting him to advocate justice according to the law. The original letter said, "Dear Sir, Since the May 30th Massacre occurred, the families of the victims established a families association, and Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai were publicly elected as representatives. This has long been reported to various government agencies. The association is supervised by the Board of Directors of the May 30th Cemetery. I am a member of the board and know that the representatives Hu Changsheng and Chen Fucai have been running around alone for five years, enduring hardships and never giving up. They are worthy of admiration. In January of this year, they received 150,000 yuan in compensation, and the method of distribution has been approved by the board of directors and passed by a majority of the families, and has been reported to the National Government. Because Li Ruiqing, Wang Zhaohua, and He Hanwen colluded with Zhichengtai Tea House to guarantee the impersonation of Luo Wenlang and fraudulently claimed 2,000 yuan in compensation from Luo Wenzhao, they later sent Luo Wenlang 240 yuan. However, this case concerns international reputation, social morality, and the reputation of the families association, as well as the personality of the two representatives Hu and Chen. It has been filed in the Special Zone Local Court according to law, requesting a thorough investigation. I believe that the two representatives Hu and Chen have always been fair, and when paying the compensation, they followed the instructions of the board of directors and issued it with a guarantee, and the procedures were complete. Please ask your lawyer to advocate human justice according to the law to clarify right and wrong and to warn against illegality.</p>

After the case was revealed, he fled to Shanghai and hid in a certain inn under his jurisdiction. They requested assistance in arresting him for investigation. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered the detective to go with the patrolman to arrest Liu and bring him to the patrol room. Yesterday, the court was asked to investigate. First, the detectives reported the previous situation. When asked about Liu Deqing, he confessed that he had conspired to commit robbery.

<p>Xiang, now wants to transfer the store to Ma Jinwan, a native of Kunshan, who is in charge of relief. The day before yesterday, the two parties went to the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenyue Edward to negotiate. Lu took the opportunity to file a complaint with the Xinzha Patrol Room, accusing Ma of embezzling 2,218 taels of relief silver and more than 200 yuan since the 16th year of the Republic of China, and claiming that Ma was about to flee, requesting immediate arrest. The police chief sent detective Che Xuezeng to the hotel to arrest Ma. Yesterday, he was taken to the Special Zone Local Court. Judge Wu interrogated him. Lu stated the amount of embezzlement and theft of relief funds by the defendant. Ma denied that he had embezzled anything, saying that he only recorded the relief items and had never handled the funds. He hired a lawyer to argue that he was indeed lured and arrested by Lu's false accusations. Judge Wu then ordered Ma to pay 2,000 yuan bail and adjourned the trial for further questioning.</p>

The relationship between the couple has been good in the past, but recently Ma has had an affair with a woman outside, causing him to often not return home. Sometimes when Qiu asked him about it, he would use social engagements as an excuse. Who knew that he had not returned home for four days recently? Qiu was shocked and feared that something unexpected had happened. She went to the bureau to visit, but Ma was not there. Ma's friend told her the truth. Qiu suddenly understood. The night before, Ma returned home after finishing his work. Qiu argued with him, and they had a quarrel. Because the secret had been leaked, Ma became angry and embarrassed and severely beat Qiu. At this point, Qiu was so painful that she did not want to live. Taking advantage of the fact that no one was prepared, she swallowed opium in an attempt to commit suicide. Before long, Ma realized what had happened and took her to Tongren Hospital by car. Fortunately, the treatment was early, and she was soon out of danger.</p>

At the same time, the Yuanxing Nanhua Store set up by Zhang Wenqing, the lace shop set up by Cai Rongxiang, and the family of Xia Changsheng were also robbed of clothing, jewelry, silver dollars, etc., worth about 1,000 yuan. They also tied up Zhang, the daughter-in-law of Xia Changsheng. When they left, they fired their guns as a demonstration and roared away. The merchants and residents of the town quickly reported to the Gu Town Public Security Bureau and telephoned the Sixth District and Donggou Public Security Bureau. They immediately led the police to search and arrest them, but they had gone like a yellow crane.

<p>Preliminary Round Held Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The first sports meeting of the Suzhou Women's Sports Association opened in Suzhou at 4 p.m. yesterday. The details of the preliminary round are described as follows:</p>
<p>大会Officials</p>

<p>Two-Day Schedule</p>

Lively Situation</p>
<p>Since the organization of the Suzhou Women's Sports Association, the previously silent atmosphere of women's sports has been broken. The holding of various ball games has also greatly increased interest. As a result, schools that did not pay attention to sports in the past are now competing in sports. It is no accident that the Suzhou Women's Middle School has repeatedly taken the lead in provincial women's ball games. However, after the organization of the association, a track and field competition had not been held once, so the development of women's sports was only deformed. It was not until recently that there was a discussion about track and field sports. According to Suzhou society, women's sports were not paid attention to at first. After the association's promotion, people competed to watch and admire the women's heroes in short trousers and white legs. Many ladies who love sports have been added to the public road. However, due to the limited area of the public sports field, the order could not be maintained, making the lively situation even more exposed.</p>
<p>Preliminary Results</p>
<p>Due to the relationship with schoolwork, the schools did not arrive until 4 p.m. The competition did not begin until 4:30 p.m. The preliminary round of 9 groups achieved good results. It is thought that there will be even more amazing performances in the final. The results are recorded below. The 200-meter relay preliminary round was initially stopped due to poor order. It is now approved that the 7 groups will have a final competition at once today (10th) and will not hold the preliminary round again.  50 Meters</p>
<p>Group 1: Zhu Guoying (Girls' Middle School), Zhang Rongchu (Leyi), Li Lu Kuang (Dongwu), 8 seconds</p>
<p>Group 2: Yang Zhen (Jinghai), Shen Peizhen (Huiling), Qian Qinhua (Chenglie), 8 seconds and four-fifths</p>
<p>Group 3: Ma Yufang (Girls' Middle School), Shen Peizhen (Leyi), Mao Yingcui (Yinghua), 8 seconds</p>
<p>Group 4: Zhang Yifen (Girls' Middle School), Tang Pinzhen (Huiling), Zhang Yuling (Yinghua), 8 seconds</p>
<p>100 Meters</p>
<p>Group 1: Zhang Yifen (Girls' Middle School), Zou Shande (Yinghua), 15 seconds and two-fifths</p>
<p>Group 2: Li Xueqin (Chenglie), Shen Shenru (Girls' Middle School), 15 seconds and three-fifths</p>
<p>Group 3: Ma Yufen (Chenglie), Zhang Jie (Dongwu), 15 seconds and three-fifths  Change of Venue</p>
<p>Yesterday's results were poor due to the difficulty in maintaining order, so the 200-meter relay has been stopped. The venue will be changed to the Dongwu playground today, and tickets must be purchased. This has now been decided by the instructors after discussion.</p>
<p>Meeting Anecdotes</p>
<p>The running track was like a people-filled alley. The sky was clear and the sun was warm that day. The audience did not obey the order, and the Boy Scouts did not care about things, resulting in the 100-meter and 50-meter running tracks forming a straight line of people-filled alley. Among them, the majority were students from various schools. Colorful paper umbrellas and heavily made-up and lightly dressed people complemented each other interestingly.</p>
<p>These Legs are White This day, the athletes from various schools were dressed in the same way. The Chenglie girls were completely bare-legged, and Dongwu was partially bare-legged.</p>
<p>Their white legs and red and white upper garments were especially beautiful. The athlete Liu Cangwei from the school, wearing a red dress and barefoot, rested, wearing a white silk coat that fluttered like a fairy. Ms. Liu has always been known as Miss Luzon. The audience therefore scrambled to call out, "Miss Luzon, these legs are white!"</p>

Therefore, the first half ended with Liangjiang leading by only thirteen to eleven. As the second half began, the Jinan forwards suddenly became active. Fortunately, the Liangjiang team consisted of experienced veterans, such as Long Jingxiong, Zhuang Shuyu, and Wang Lan, who defended like iron barrels, ultimately rendering the Jinan forwards helpless. Meanwhile, Shao Jinying, Yang Pinggang, Tu Yunsheng, and others of Liangjiang became even more courageous, and their coordinated shots were almost always on target.

<h3 id="e167">Feihong and Four Other Municipal Schools <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>in the Concessions Request the Recovery of Educational Rights in the Concessions</p>
<p>Letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng, the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau, solemnly issued a declaration on the 4th of this month to recover educational rights in the concessions, which has been recorded in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the principals of the municipal Feihong and four other schools in the concession area also wrote to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, stating the urgency of reorganizing Chinese education in the concessions and the necessity of recovering educational rights. The following is recorded: To Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Xu Xinzhi, Mr. Bei Songsun, and Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the Chinese Directors of the Public Works Department, esteemed sirs: We sincerely congratulate you on being elected as Chinese Directors of the Public Works Department of the concessions, as you are expected by the public. We are even more admirable for your enthusiasm and perseverance in implementing the proposal of increasing the number of Chinese Directors for taxpayers. At the beginning of your assumption of office, it is a great fortune that the Municipal Education Bureau has proposed to recover educational rights in the concessions. With your wisdom, you are well aware of the current state of education in the concessions. With your ability, you will certainly promote the realization of the Municipal Education Bureau's proposal to recover educational rights in the concessions. Our schools are all located in the concessions and are particularly hopeful for the realization of this proposal. Therefore, we would like to offer a few humble suggestions and hope that you will consider them. The Chinese education managed by the Public Works Department of the concessions has already been suffered by the Chinese children in our concessions. Given the large amount of rent paid by the Chinese, the Chinese education expenditure of the Public Works Department accounts for less than two percent of its total income, which is not comparable to the 20% of the municipal government's education expenditure, nor is it comparable to the 30% of the education expenditure of foreign cities. Given the size of the concession area and the large number of Chinese children, the number of Chinese children's schools established by the Public Works Department is less than ten, and most of their contents do not conform to the educational purposes of our country. Every Chinese in the concessions has children, and everyone wants their children to receive a good education from an early age. Today, the enrollment of Chinese children in the concessions has become a major problem. What could be worse? Our schools are located in the concessions and have always regarded Chinese education in the concessions as our own responsibility. However, the number of Chinese children in the concessions is so large that these four schools are just a drop in the bucket. Although we have been trying our best to expand over the years, every time school starts, the number of applicants to our schools exceeds the fixed enrollment quota by tenfold, and we cannot accommodate them as much as we would like. Is this not a pity? Now, for the sake of the Chinese Directors in the concessions, it is urgent to reorganize Chinese schools in the concessions and seek expansion. The Chinese education expenditure of the Public Works Department must be increased to at least 20% of its total income. The Chinese education administration in the concessions must be unified and directly administered by the Municipal Education Bureau. The Chinese children's schools already run by the Public Works Department should be handed over to the Education Bureau for reception and rectification, and the Education Bureau should plan to set up more municipal schools in the concessions. As for the problems of private schools and substandard private schools in the concessions, they can be solved. Thinking of the welfare of the Chinese in the concessions, we rely on you to think about the Chinese children in the concessions and urge the Public Works Department to realize this as soon as possible. We are extremely grateful. We have taken the liberty to state our views and await your instructions. We wish you all the best. Tang Tiantao, Principal of Shanghai Special Municipal Feihong Primary School; Wang Dingcheng, Principal of Bide Primary School; Zhou Darong, Principal of Shuji Primary School; Qian Xuanqing, Principal of He'an Primary School, May 9th.</p>

<p>Gave an Academic Lecture at Jinan University Yesterday</p>
<p>Hoping that Modern Writers of Ci Can Create a New Realm</p>
<p>Beyond the Scenery and Integrate Understanding and Set People to Musical Tunes</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Gongchuo lectured at Jinan University yesterday at the invitation of Mr. Chen Zhu, the head of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature. First, Vice President Hong Ji introduced him, and then Mr. Ye took the stage to speak. The topic of the lecture was "Photography of Qing Dynasty Ci Studies." Mr. Ye used scientific methods to sort out and historical perspectives to compare and evaluate the Ci writers of the Qing Dynasty. He listed them in tables, horizontally dividing them by region. Jiangsu and Zhejiang were the most prosperous. Jiangsu produced as many as 2,009 Ci writers in the Qing Dynasty, and Zhejiang produced 1,248. Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan were next, and Gansu and Mongolia were the least, with three each. Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang had none. A total of 4,850 people were counted, with 4,233 having registered residences. However, there were still omissions, and the total could reach about 6,000 people. Vertically, the Shunzhi period inherited the remaining style of the late Ming Dynasty, with 188 people. The Qianlong period had 362 people, and the Jiaqing period had 328 people, all considered prosperous. The Daoguang period had the most, reaching 440 people, likely influenced by the prevalence of the Changzhou Ci school. The above is from a quantitative observation. The large number of Ci writers in the Qing Dynasty can be imagined. From a qualitative perspective, the Song Dynasty was the most prosperous for Ci writers, and Ci studies were also extremely complete. The Yuan Dynasty was second, but Song people regarded Ci as mere recreational writing after tea and wine, and its style was not very noble. The Yuan Dynasty was second, and the Ming Dynasty regarded it as a low-grade product of weaving and enchanting beauty. In the Qing Dynasty, Zhejiang took the lead, and Zhu Yizun and others emerged, reforming the bad habits of the Ming Dynasty. After the Jiaqing period, the Changzhou school emerged, with Zhang Huiyan and Zhou Ji at the forefront, focusing on broad-mindedness and artistic conception, and the spirit of Ci was greatly enhanced. The Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, Guangxu, and Xuantong periods were influenced by it. The Guipai school followed, and Wang Pengyun and Kuang Zhouyi of the Guangxu period used the Changzhou school as a foundation, gradually evolving and adding their unique views, and the atmosphere changed again. However, what the three schools agreed on without prior consultation was to elevate the status of Ci and regard it as a noble literature. Therefore, its advantage lies in its ability to respect the foundation, and the second is strict adherence to the rules. Ci was originally valued for its ability to be sung with music. Later generations lost the musical rhythm, and the Ci of the Southern Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties did not conform to the rhythm. There were also many Ci that did not conform to the rhythm in the early Qing Dynasty during the Shunzhi and Kangxi periods. Since Wan Shida of the Shunzhi and Yongzheng periods fixed the Ci rhythm, and Ge Zai of the Jiaqing and Xianfeng periods fixed the 词谱 (cípǔ), the books of the two became the norms for Ci writing by various families in later generations. After the Xianfeng period, the rhythm was even stricter, and the five sounds of yin and yang were analyzed clearly. Various academic studies in the Qing Dynasty surpassed the previous dynasties, and this was not limited to Ci studies. However, Ci was particularly prominent. Dong Shi said that poetry, Ci, and song were originally the same but diverged. The poetry and song of the Qing Dynasty generally could not surpass the Ming Dynasty, but the efforts made by the Ci writers were unique. In the history of Chinese literature, whether viewed horizontally or vertically, it occupies an important position. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion: the Ci of the Qing Dynasty surpassed the Ming Dynasty and directly inherited the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Predecessors in Ci writing focused on two points: emotion and scenery, or scenery with emotion, or generating emotion based on the scenery, or integrating emotion and scenery. However, according to my personal opinion, in the future, if Ci studies want to evolve and create a new realm, understanding can be added in addition to emotion and scenery. This "understanding" may not have been mentioned by predecessors. The integration of emotion, scenery, and understanding can create a new realm through imagination, which can surpass the predecessors. This may be possible. Filling in Ci without restraint does not conform to the rhyme, but conforming to the rhyme does not mean it can be set to music. The original sources of rhyme are mostly impossible to verify, so one can only fill in according to the old tunes. However, the tunes of Ci were also created by predecessors. Why can't we create new tunes? If we can examine their origins, we can create from our own musical ideas. We can even compose music for them. Zhu Yizun of the late Ming Dynasty was the first step in organizing the efforts. We can do this kind of change after the prosperity of Qing Dynasty Ci. I hope that those who aspire to write Ci will trace back to the source and work hard to create new Ci," he said. The lecture lasted about an hour and a half and was very engaging. Finally, Mr. Chen Zhu expressed his gratitude on behalf of the department.</p>

<p>The commercial library of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has completed the expansion of the book collection area and the internal layout, and it is now open as usual. Since the library's book collection area was merged into one place, it is more convenient to access books, and the appearance is better. In recent days, the number of readers and visitors has increased even more. The second catalog has been compiled and will be published soon. Recently, there have been many new books published by various bookstores. It is now reported that the library has requested new books from various bookstores and has successively received donations, including 19 types of new books from the Commercial Press, 11 types of new books from the China Book Company, 26 types of new books from the Minzhi Book Company, 22 types of new books from the Yadong Library, 6 books from the Shenzhou Guoguang Society, 4 types of new books from the Guangyi Book Company, a regular subscription to New Moon Magazine from the New Moon Bookstore, and other bookstores have also agreed to donate books. These are all new books on economics, law, politics, and culture, which are very suitable for readers. They are currently being registered and cataloged, and as soon as the procedures are completed, they will be displayed on the shelves for public viewing and included in the supplement to the second catalog.</p>

<p>In recent years, the number of students from Haimen studying in Shanghai has been increasing. Usually, there is a lack of contact, and the relationship is therefore estranged. Huang Keding and other alumni in Shanghai, in view of this, initiated the organization of the Haimen Shanghai Alumni Association, with the purpose of connecting feelings and polishing academic studies. Preparations have been made, and a preparatory committee was established yesterday to start work. It is now planned to start by soliciting members. It is hoped that all students will mail their names and school names to Huang Keding, Xinmin University, Kangnuo Road, before May 20, so that they can be compiled and notified to convene a general meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e171">After Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Ninetieth Birthday <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>On the fourth of this month, contemporary celebrities gathered at Aurora University to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. The Aurora University Alumni Association, led by Wei Tingrong, Zhu Yanzhi, He Shangping, and myself, served as hosts, so I have more detailed information. I will record it as follows.</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Birthday Couplets: Cai Zimin wrote couplets for Ms. Ge Chenghui, a former student of the Patriotic Girls' School, and Ms. Zhou Jun (i.e., Cai's wife): "Wonderful metaphors are like Mount Cen, a mustard seed; learning increases daily, a great catalpa tree for a thousand autumns." Yu Youren wrote couplets on behalf of Fudan University: "He is a paragon of virtue in this era, a Fusheng in the scientific community." Yang Xingfo's couplet was: "The four seas share a realm of benevolence and longevity, the teacher laughs heartily over eight thousand fields." Wang Jingqi collected couplets from the Book of Changes: "Sharpening virtue and talent, serving as assistants to the country; cultivating the Way and nurturing longevity, extending the ruler's years." Xu Jilong, a hermit of Mount Huang, wrote birthday poems, four large scrolls in total, full of emotional sighs and melancholy, with flamboyant brushstrokes. Zhang Taiyan's calligraphy couplets were also ancient, simple, and neat. Zhang Qi, a six-year-old boy (the son of Mr. Taiyan), wrote the birthday plaque "Longevity comparable to Golden Jiao (Island)," which had quite a structure and was praised as a genius. Guan Jin, an old man, painted a pine and Ganoderma lucidum longevity painting, which was naturally extraordinary from an old master (presented by Mr. Wu Tegong and others from this museum). Ms. Yang Xuejiu's pine-age stone longevity painting was elegant, vigorous, and had the style of a White Dragon Mountain person.</p>
<p>Daily Life and Health Care: As I have been living with Mr. Xiang for many years, I know him quite well. Mr. Xiang is a devout Catholic. Every morning at around five o'clock, he must go up and down three floors to attend Mass in the church, even in wind and rain. In the cold winter, when it is still dark, he goes downstairs with a cane. At other times, like Yang Tieya in his later years, he does not go downstairs. He usually does not eat rice or vegetables, but mainly consumes chicken juice, beef juice, chicken eggs, and milk. He is diligent in bathing and sleeps for one or two hours in the afternoon, which is his routine. During the day, he always has a book in his hand and rarely exercises, which is completely different from the hygiene of Wu Zhiyong and Okuma Shigenobu. He has read many Buddhist scriptures and has unique insights. Mr. Xiang and Yang Renshan also worked together on Sakura Island in his early years. On that day, Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, and Yang Xingfo all gave speeches, which were full of wit. The birthday honoree, known for his wonderful language, also gave a very long speech, which I will record separately.</p>
<p>The Number One Poet in Zheng Sukan's Eyes · He · Tian · Jian ·</p>
<p>A scholar born in this age who wants to be valued by his ancient literature, although he may not suffer the humiliation of wearing a 章甫 (zhāngfǔ, a type of hat) in Yue (a metaphor for misplaced talent), it is inevitable that he will be blind and difficult to see himself. Fortunately, even in the dark and stormy weather, the rooster crows incessantly. There are still experienced adults. Yesterday, Wu Chang told me about Mr. Zheng Sukan's encounter with a poet, which is worth recording. One day, a man in his fifties or older visited Mr. Zheng. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, he said solemnly and sincerely, "You are a literary giant of our time. I do not want to seek fame at the Dragon Gate. I am going to decide my progress and retreat on your guidance. Are you interested?" Zheng asked about the matter. He said, "I have been studying poetry for nearly thirty years, and I have created countless works, but I am walking blindly and do not know where I am going. Now I want to get a word from you to determine my next step." Zheng felt sorry for his intention and immediately asked to read his poems. The man was delighted and promised to present them for review on a certain day. Zheng flipped through his poems, one or two volumes, and exclaimed, "This is the number one poet of our time. He is my teacher!" The man looked around hesitantly, overwhelmed by the honor. The next day, Zheng told others about this, and they all wanted to read his poems and see his demeanor. Alas! After more than fifty years of cultivation, he gained fame overnight with a word from Mr. Zheng. Such a person also knows how to guard himself and see himself. From the incident, we can infer that his poems are clear and orderly. Then, the world is so big, how can we be complacent?</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Grand Occasion of the Buddha's Birthday · Zhou · Cai · Liang · <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the eighth day of the fourth lunar month) was the birthday of the Buddha, Sakyamuni. Jing'an Temple in West Shanghai had its usual incense market. On this day, the sky was clear and the air was fresh, and the gentle breeze was pleasant. Men and women who were enjoying the spring gathered there. Jing'an Temple Road, from morning to dusk, was packed with people, like the mountain path of Shanyin. The temple was crowded, the incense was thick, and the excitement was unprecedented in recent years. I am a student at Zhengfeng, which is nearby. I heard and saw many interesting things, so I will briefly record one or two of them based on what I observed.</p>
<p>Buddha Lao Serves as Matchmaker: In the morning, I happened to be playing in the temple and met a couple dressed in fancy clothes, whispering sweet words and walking arm in arm into the inner hall. They both bowed down in front of the altar very respectfully, and seemed to be praying: "We are in love and wish to be companions forever. I hope that the Buddha will be merciful and help us become husband and wife as soon as possible." The rest of the words were too soft to hear, which was a pity. At that time, the onlookers all looked at them, not knowing what was happening. I thought that the couple's love must have reached its peak, so they were unrestrained and unashamed. It can be said that they are thinking too much by using Buddha Lao as a matchmaker.</p>
<p>Women's Army Fighting: Most of the incense and candle stalls at the temple gate were set up by women. Although the business was good, the competition was fierce. From time to time, several women from the countryside would choose things from Stall A for a long time, but eventually, they did not succeed due to the high price. They then bought from Stall B, and the woman from Stall A started a war. At first, it was just arguing, and then they started fighting. They punched and kicked each other. Later, the onlookers persuaded them to stop, but both sides had already been beaten badly.</p>
<p>Foreigners Being Fooled: The temporary markets set up on the roads near the temple mostly sold household goods of various colors. Since the number of visitors was large this time, each store made three times its profit. Some unscrupulous people started to do business unscrupulously. I saw a foreigner in a certain store buying about ten paper suitcases and happily bundling them up and leaving. I was surprised and asked the owner of the store about the price. The owner smiled and said, "I make the most profit and have the best business selling this thing (paper is easy to break). Now he bought my goods at twice the price and still thinks they are cheap. Aren't foreigners foolish?" I sighed and said, "The reason why our country's commerce is not prosperous is all because of the despicable behavior of those people. They only know the immediate benefits and do not care about the long-term harm, and their failure is appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Yizheng's Three-Day Diary (1) - A Complete Record by Xie Fensheng, Leader of the National Hiking Group <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>April 16th, 9:30 AM. Together with my comrades, we departed from Liuhe County, exiting through the east gate. We set off towards Yizheng County. That day, due to the recent rains, the roads were muddy. One could not help but sigh, "It's impossible to walk!" However, my comrades did not lose heart because of this. One step, one stumble, we still strived to move forward. At 11:35 AM, we arrived at Hengliangdian. We entered a village shop for lunch. Unfortunately, the area had suffered repeated poor harvests in the autumn, and the price of rice was high. The restaurant could not cook enough rice to satisfy the guests. I had to buy noodles and cook them myself to fill my stomach. At 12:20 PM, after a short rest, we resumed our journey towards Chenbanqiao. That day, the scorching sun beat down on our backs, and sweat soaked through our clothes. The sweat and mud under our feet were like paste, making it impossible to walk quickly. A distance of twenty *li* took us three hours. One can imagine how difficult the road was. We rested for about thirty minutes there, then continued forward. By the time we crossed Xupu Bridge, the setting sun had already disappeared, and the stars filled the sky. It was less than four *li* from the county seat, but it was already late (8:20 PM), and there were many forks in the road, making us unsure of which way to go. Helplessly, we retreated to Xupu Bridge. (Xupu Bridge is named for the place where Wu Zixu crossed the river.) The area is an important road on the western route of Yizheng. The county government had a police detachment stationed there with strict security. At that time, I explained everything to the soldiers of the detachment and presented official documents and passports to prove our identity. I requested to borrow a branch to perch on, intending to enter the city at dawn. However, there were only three or five rustic shops and a dozen thatched huts, with no place to stay. We were in a dilemma, and could only exclaim "Alas!" Fortunately, someone like a squad leader in the detachment said to me, "Gentlemen, you have worked hard to get here. We should try to help you, but the place is small and there are few houses, so we cannot accommodate all of you. We could make room for one or two, but we are helpless to assist your group of seven. However, I can send two soldiers to lead and escort you into the city." We were delighted and expressed our gratitude, following closely behind the leaders. Fortunately, we had electric torches, so we were not walking on a completely dark path, unable to distinguish between high and low ground. It was 10:00 PM when we finally reached the west gate. The leaders knocked on the gate and sent us in, lodging us at the Zhenzhou Inn. The innkeeper mistook us for soldiers and refused us, saying the inn was full. After I explained, he happily cleared a room for us. We ate a hearty meal and then went to bed. That day, we traveled seventy *li*. The pedometer recorded 71,654 steps, a new record for us since we set out.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Religious Bias and Sexual Frustration - Liuzhi <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Reason for the Assassination of the Inventor of the Art of Resurrection - Reading Mr. Huang Yingdai's "Talking About the Art of Resurrection" in the *Riben Tan* on the 28th, it briefly stated that Professor Miroski of the Central Asian University used scientific methods to bring monkeys back from the dead. He planned to apply this to humans in the hope of realizing the ideal of eternal life. Unexpectedly, he himself was suddenly assassinated, and his wife was suspected. I felt that he had not mentioned the reason for Mr. Miroski's assassination and why his wife was suspected of killing her husband. Presuming on my lack of talent, I dare to follow up like a dog's tail extending a sable coat. According to reports, Central Asia has always been known to the world for its isolation. The people are stuck in their ways and unchanging. Their customs and systems have remained almost the same for thousands of years. Although there is a new communist ideology and the modern spirit of the East permeating it, the religious color is still very strong. The news of Mr. Miroski's resurrection experiments aroused the anger of religious fanatics, who believed that only God is the omnipotent master. God wills that humans and monkeys die, and Mr. Miroski dared to advocate heretical arts in an attempt to defy this. If Mr. Miroski did not die, God would be in danger. Therefore, Mr. Miroski received various anonymous threats before his death and did not dare to take a step without armed protection. Mr. Miroski was highly respected and had never harbored grudges against anyone. Now that he has unfortunately been killed, the reason should not be other than this. Mrs. Miroski is a devout Catholic. She had some reservations about Mr. Miroski's experiments. Mr. Miroski had a secret diary that fell into the hands of others after his death. It contained suspicions that the anonymous threats were made by his wife. Moreover, the gun that killed Mr. Miroski was next to his body, and there were many fingerprints on it, many of which matched his wife's fingerprints. Therefore, her suspicion in this case is very significant. However, even if Mr. Miroski was killed by his wife, it is still questionable whether the motive was religious bias. Because a draft of a letter from Mr. Miroski to his relatives was found afterward, saying that he was so focused on his experiments that he forgot his marital responsibilities and had become an unfeeling husband. Then, Mrs. Miroski already felt great sexual frustration. This is also enough to trigger the murder.</p>
<p>Short News: *Chunshui Wei Bo*, published by Shanghai's Rose Bookstore, is the latest published social romance novel. Since the bookstore commissioned Xuzhou's World Bookstore to sell it on consignment, sales have been very strong. Mr. Liu Jingfu, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army Corps of the National Revolutionary Army, also brought four attendants with him on the 25th of the month to purchase and read this book, and praised it.

<p>Chapter Ten: Red Flames Rise to the Sky, Goulan Praises the Filial Daughter, Red Carpet on the Ground, Impromptu Meeting with Famous Actors</p>
<p>Today, this bridegroom, Liu Yinbo, has always been a very generous and lively person. It is his own wedding celebration, so he is very happy. After the banquet was set up, several groomsmen had already invited the guests to take their seats. The bridegroom himself came out to toast everyone, and everyone invited him to sit down at their tables, saying, "You've worked very hard today, take a rest." But he couldn't sit still. He ran around, and then shouted, "Why don't you call a *ju*? Calling a *ju* will make it more lively, and you can also invite them to listen to the opera!" Everyone said, "Calling a *ju* is good, but the place is too far away, it's a bit inconvenient." Liu Yinbo said, "There's nothing inconvenient. We'll use carriages to pick them up." It turned out that at this time in Shanghai, cars were not yet very popular. Liu Yinbo had hired ten carriages to bring the many ladies and young ladies to the wedding banquet, so he said, "Quickly write out the *ju* tickets, and I'll tell the coachmen to pick them up one by one. With ten carriages here, three people can sit in one carriage, so you can call thirty *ju*! Moreover, after picking up one batch, you can turn around. The more you call, the more lively it will be." Everyone said, "Well, the Wei Chun Garden doesn't have *ju* tickets. Just grab some pieces of paper." At this time, the owner of the garden happened to be present and said, "No need, no need. I have them here. Tell them to go get them." He then called a tea boy named Ah Quan and said, "Go to the old foreign-style house and bring the guest tickets and *ju* tickets." It turned out that this Ankai residence was newly built, called the "new foreign-style house." There was also a foreign-style house to the north that was built earlier, called the "old foreign-style house." People often borrowed this place to host banquets, so they had all the guest tickets and *ju* tickets prepared there, just in case they were needed. After Ah Quan brought the *ju* tickets, Liu Yinbo even more happily told his brother, Xing Shu, to greet everyone at each table. Some people always called a *ju*, and some people never called a *ju*. He had them all written down, who called whom, and they could be divided by location and distributed in large quantities. Although the North Lane of Shanghai is all in one place, between Fuzhou Road and Zhejiang Road, it is still necessary to arrange them a little before handing them to the coachmen. Which *ju* would be picked up by which carriage? Because they were all on the same route. Counting the *ju* tickets, there were more than twenty. If all of them were picked up, these ten carriages would not be enough! Because in addition to the *ju* herself, there was also a follower. Didn't this already double the number of people? And some of them sang outside the hall, so they had to turn around and pick them up again. After dealing with this for half an hour, all ten carriages set off.</p>

<p>Call Loan Market Chaotic, Trading Still Active</p>
<p>Market Overview: In recent days, foreign exchange has been robust due to strong sales by silk merchants. Although supply and demand are balanced, preventing depletion, the complexity of handling procedures has reached its peak. However, the call loan rate has not risen due to abundant reserves and mixed use of banknotes.

<p>The yarn market rose slightly, and the trend remained flat. Because the situation was unstable, the sales to customers were not very smooth. The market sentiment softened, and there was no intention to turn to long positions. The new sellers were unwilling to act rashly because the base was too weak. For these reasons, the market remained stable and sustained. The yarn market situation was still lacking in confidence.</p>

<p>American Cotton Skyrockets... Spot Demand Active</p>
<p>The cotton market was suddenly strong, because the price of American cotton futures suddenly rose by more than 40 pounds, which excited people. Retail investors were buying, and British factories were purchasing spot cotton in large quantities, making the market tighter. The Han gang took the opportunity to sell slightly, and a certain factory was determined to short October new cotton. The future depends on the shift of American cotton. The price of cotton rose sharply by 3 *qian*. The Han standard market opened before the market and was tight because the price of American cotton rose sharply and the buying interest was strong. Each month rose by 1.5 to 2.5 *qian*. In the afternoon, the near month remained strong and rose another 1.5 *qian*. The far month rose only 0.5 *qian*.

<p>Overseas silk inventories are quite high. Japanese silk stocks are rumored to be around 100,000 dan. European sales are not improving. Telegrams indicate little progress in Shanghai for both new and old silk. European firms are taking a wait-and-see approach. Yesterday, only Lienner and others imported 20 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, and Ganli imported 30 packages of gray silk, with prices remaining weak.</p>

<p>Affected by the weather, harvests are at most 60%.</p>
<p>The silkworm season in Jinhua and Lanxi, Zhejiang Province, is the earliest. Due to unrest in Youbu and other areas, fewer silkworms were raised. The weather turned cold after the mulberry leaves sprouted, delaying development. After the third molt, the weather became suddenly cold and hot, with continuous rain, making silkworm rearing difficult for farmers. During the peak of the fourth molt, the weather remained cold and rainy, causing widespread silkworm diseases and losses. Early silkworms have already spun cocoons, but the quality is poor. The cocoon market opens today, with low expected prices. It is estimated that this year's new cocoons in Jinhua and other counties will be at most 60% of a normal year.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Zhejiang Cocoons Subject to 10% Security Levy <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in light of the unrest in various counties and the imminent arrival of new cocoons on the market, is concerned about silk and cocoon merchants carrying funds to purchase cocoons in various counties. It is imperative to increase military and police patrols to provide protection. The Security Department has now assigned military and police forces to maintain order in sections, with the total force exceeding previous years by more than 10%. The required funds are substantial. The Provincial Government's Political Affairs Committee has resolved to levy a 10% security donation on the dry-land tax to provide subsidies, with a term of one year. This has been announced and is being implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Poor European Sales of Local Green Tea <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since local green tea from native estates came onto the market in this port, transactions have been very sparse for days. Tea firms have put out new samples of local "Zhenmei", already over 20 characters, totaling over one thousand chests. In the last few days, only Jardine Matheson and Ewo have purchased 109 chests, with selling prices from 76 to 107 taels. The poor sales to Europe can be seen. In addition, anti-British protests are occurring in India, and the Bombay market, which sells a lot of green tea, is particularly intense. Therefore, foreign tea merchants are tending to take a wait-and-see approach, and the market outlook is quite pessimistic.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-based British firm Jardine Matheson shipped various types of Lu Zhuang Ping Shui green tea to New York last year. After testing by the US government, it was found to contain white impurities and was banned from import, resulting in significant losses. They have already informed the Tea Guild and notified tea merchants in all regions that this year's green tea sold to the US should not contain any white color to avoid detection by the US government and a ban on import.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Rice Market in He Xia Continues to Stabilize <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Few boats arrived at Zhabei yesterday, and sales remained sluggish. The price of northern japonica rice is showing a continuing stabilization trend. This is because japonica rice from Su and Ci is being shipped back to the mainland. The source of supply will become increasingly scarce in the future. Although sales in this street are taking a wait-and-see approach due to the arrival of foreign rice, demand for medium and high-quality goods is still active, making it difficult for the market to fall further. For the time being, the market may tend to fluctuate without surprises. Supplies of thin-husk rice are scarce and prices remain stable. Buying interest is weak, and the market lacks prosperity. Transactions of Yang Du Jian rice are slightly active. Merchants are unwilling to sell at a lower price, and the market appears stable. The price of white Yuan rice is high and firm. Demand from out-of-town merchants is still acceptable, and the trend is quite stable.</p>
<p>Few goods arrived at He Xia in South Shanghai. There was slight movement in northern japonica rice from Changshu and Wuxi villages. Demand in this street was sluggish, and there were no changes in the overall market. Sales of Su Tong white japonica rice were very slow. Only top-quality goods saw slight activity, while the rest attracted little interest. However, the supply is exhausted, and prices are stable due to a lack of rises and falls. Ning-style early indica rice and southern merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, and sales are therefore slack. The market is stable with a hint of weakness. The market for Du Jian rice is fair, with both arrivals and sales being slow. Trading conditions are poor because merchant sales are inactive, so prices are slightly weak. Limited purchases of Yin Yuan rice are being made, and the supply is scarce. Prices of high and medium-quality rice are stable.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Large Arrivals of Foreign Rice, Slow Sales <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was slightly more active because, in addition to purchases by merchants and retailers in this street, merchants from Jiangxi Province were also buying in the market. Market sentiment was good. However, current rice inventories are sufficient, and several new ships have arrived, resulting in supply exceeding demand. It is ultimately difficult for prices to be supported. Therefore, the prices of medium-grade goods have all fallen by about a cent. High-quality goods such as Annam japonica rice saw no transactions, but sellers' intentions remained firm. The market may temporarily stabilize. 2,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 were sold for 15 yuan and 3 jiao 2 fen. Also, 1,000 bags of No. 2 for 14 yuan and 6 jiao 5 fen. 2,000 bags of "Da Jiao" for 14 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen. 4,000 bags of "Xiao Jiao" for 14 yuan and 6 jiao 3 fen. Also, 4,000 bags of goods at 20 Jiaolu for 14 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Piece Goods Market Stagnant <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods trading has been quiet in recent days due to the off-season. Whether it's local merchants or out-of-town merchants, business is quite slow, so the market is even more lifeless. Except for the Yuan Yang yarn and white crepe, which are in short supply and showing strength, everything else is weak. The Changbanqiao straight tribute flannel, which was once out of stock, has arrived in 50 pieces and will be available for shipment next Tuesday. The price is set at 2 mace 8 fen less commission. There have been slight transactions in this street. There is no definite date for the arrival of the Qiu Xi Bi Ji. Shile Bird fine cloth had previously risen due to Tianjin merchants' purchases, but has now fallen back to 7 taels and 7 mace 5 fen. Blue striped Satin, printed cloth, and crepe remain very weak. The decline in civilized satin is even faster. Yesterday, both "Foreign Beauty" and "Yang Guifei" sold for 1 mace 5 fen 5 li, and "Yun Tongzi" at 1 mace 5 fen, willing to sell them off, showing a downward trend. The reason is that local products are gradually increasing, selling for only 1 mace 4 fen 5 li, coupled with sluggish sales. Yesterday, Changjiang merchants made slight transactions in Western goods blue striped cotton fabric. Jinlong Tian Tong Shan was 3 mace 8 fen 5 li, and Ewo's Women's Army was 3 mace 2 fen 5 li. Northern merchants bought more than 30 pieces of jacquard foreign yarn, and the prices were all around 3 mace 7 fen.</p>
