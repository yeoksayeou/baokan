<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界經濟與失業問題（默）</h3>
<p>各國經濟狀態不穩定。與工人失業人數突增。爲今日世界之兩大問題。其實此兩問題實相因而生者也。歐洲大戰所發生之影響初因戰爭上種種損失。陷國民於窮困。資源蕩然經濟上之正軌破壤。聯絡切斷。此爲一時期其後數年間。經各國努力於生產之發展貿易之增進。一時經濟狀態。得稍穩定但其穩定。能否長時期繼續能否回復戰前繁榮。而不伏不穩定之危機在内。固無論何人不能斷定。何以故。各國生產與貿易之進展不均即即發生經濟上之軋轢。一方向外即起市塲優越權之爭。向内即生資勞階級之爭。再以供求相應之理言之。生產與消費應同様展方能穩定。若生產力急速進展超過消費能力。則生產過剩。即可發生恐慌。而工人失業問題即隨此種現象而來。如目前之美國與日本。生產貿易突飛猛進似乎其經濟極可穩定矣。然而日美之經濟現狀常伏危機其工人失業之數亦與其他生產落後之國同様突增或且更甚。此僅就不均衡之常態言之若言其變則隨時可生意外風潮隨時可使金融市塲搖動故吾謂世界經濟之不穩定。與工人失業之兩問題實相聯爲一且與各國均有相聯之關係謀救濟此種問題者不能專顧國内專爲己國着想而不一問世界之狀態也</p>

<h3>中美航潮擴大</h3>
<p>自太平洋湖絲水脚發生競爭風潮、减收每百磅一元以後、川崎汽船、昨日已先實行今次該社之華爾斯丸輪出口、即裝去湖絲四百五十件、係運至舊金山再轉鐵路到紐約者、加鐵道轉運水脚、每件九元、則百磅湖絲、自上海裝出至紐約、水陸運賃、計納美金十元、經二十三日可以到達、本埠之大來·昌興·等减費後、裝由西雅圖與温哥武班輪去美者、祗須十九日便可以達到紐約矣、惟因此問題而中美航業界、發生巨大之恐慌、蓋滬上英美日商之紐約線内各輪公司、共有十餘家因爭遠東貨運、去年各造新輪、自此次湖絲水脚爲日商搗亂以來、各公司亦於昨日開緊急大會、討論競爭之策、以上海直放紐約輪、至快須三十六七日、較大平洋船相差兩星期、但可免陸運水脚一道、查貨運遲速有押匯利息關係、故紐約班各輪、特開同盟大會議定、自滬赴紐約之湖絲、每件减收美金四元（較太平洋輪合火車運費、更可廉短六元、）並决定自今日起、便即實施以期與太平洋内各郵船之互相競爭、致中美航潮、又益擴大矣、</p>
<h3>北洋航訊</h3>
<p>去年天津白河、在冬令期内、水淺而又冰凍、上海各輪公司、因運津貨件祗可以到大沽口再用駁船轉運、所以每件貨物如糧食等項、須增收駁費銀五分、又洋布等項每噸、亦加收駁費銀八錢四分、近日白河水已漲、昨日天津電告言河水業有十八尺冰亦溶解、貨可入港、故各輪公司宣布、從今日起、將駁費取消矣、</p>
<h3>中日間飛航尚難實現</h3>
<p>中日修約以前不准定期飛航</p>
<p>日本國際航空運輸會社籌劃之中日國際航空運輸、積極籌備、早將一應手續、籌備妥全、原定三月一日起試航、四月一日起正式飛航、一方并由代理公使重光葵、面令駐京日領上村、就近向外交部交涉、要求准許飛航、交涉多次、未有眉目、前日重光代使、已接外部王外長正式通知、對於此項定期國際運輸、因與中日商約有關、故在中日新約未曾修訂以前、碍難許可、將來修訂新約時、再行併案討論、至於非正式之試騐飛航、如經外部許可、或准實行、故此項定期實行計劃、已中止進行矣、</p>
<h3>工部局改選董事日期</h3>

<p>鄕董報告署長率警四十兜拿</p>
<p>拘獲賭徒十六名</p>
<p>官警受傷共七人</p>
<p>昨晨三時許、眞茹鎭四區三轄境内、發生鄕民拒警案、因該區警士往金巷捉徒、突被鄕民一百餘名、持有手槍駁壳槍大刀鐵木棍鋤斧等凶器、鳴槍六七十響、傷巡官等六名、刦去槍械數枝、銀洋符號制服等物甚夥、直至黎明時、始拿獲凶犯十六名、茲將詳情分誌如次、</p>
<p>豪賭三窟　眞茹離滬十八里、地處西北隅、居民類皆務農、警務實鞭長莫及、值茲廢歷新年中、一般地痞流氓、輒聚衆賭博、抽頭漁利、其爲害甚烈、但影踪極秘、防備週到、每難拘捕、故近更肆無忌憚、賭窟有三處之多、</p>
<p>楊董報告　該鎭鄕董楊品芝、鑒於賭風日熾、不忍袖手旁觀、緣於前晚九時餘、投禀該官四區三所、請派警往緝、</p>
<p>追逐聚衆　楊署長據報後、立飭巡官程衍昆、巡長劉渭北、巡警桑萬卿、白俊卿等、各带電筒符號等物、星夜前往金巷拘捕、行經鎭八里許之水香廟附近、迎面遇見鄕民四人、中有一人懷抱小孩、衣服麗都、程巡官察彼行踪可疑、遂喝令止步、聽候檢查訽問、該鄕民答稱、我儕吃喜酒歸來、無庸搜查、巡官以其出言不遜、上前攔住、詎其中二人、忽向後奔逃、乃益加疑慮、飛步追上、奈　不見天、刹時間三人踪跡杳然、而一人取出警笛狂鳴、無何鄕民聞聲麕集、銅鑼喧天、不數分鐘、愈聚愈衆、約一百餘名、或執手槍駁壳槍、或手持大刀鐵木棍、或負鋤斧竹竿等物、蜂湧而至、勢聲洶洶、並高喊向前衝、打死他、聲達數里、</p>
<p>鄕民頑抗　時警士等以衆寡不敵、絶不抵抗、程巡官恐肇事端、乃一面飭警回報署長、已則踴登高處、諄諄勸諭曰、我等來此捕賭、係爲民除害、爾等皆安分鄕民、何出此暴動、有事儘可磋商、庸詎知鄕民蠻不講理、備槍者鳴放不已、聲如聯珠、約十分鐘、槍彈告罄、繼之刀棍、在此一髮千鈞之際、程巡官命警不准還擊、而伏匿於該處低窪處、藉避危險、但結果受傷多名、</p>
<p>武裝拿犯　半小時後、楊署長率警四十餘名、武裝實彈、趕至彈壓、鄕民睹狀、知勢不敵、紛紛作鳥獸散、警乃奮勇兜拿、拘獲凶犯十二名、但傷者纍纍、咸臥地不能動彈、當將獲犯押带回署、詎行經離署二里許、後面又有大批鄕民趕來、意圖刦奮、署長乃命警朝空開槍數響、將若輩嚇退、並進前跴緝、又續獲四名、一併带署、</p>
<p>獲犯題名　詢據被逮者、供陳阿友嘉定人、四十六歲、住朱陽橋、錢永才二十八歲、住落陽橋、開設米店、陳春生二十二歳、住陳家宅、錢伯生住落陽橋、三十歲、錢錫堂四十八歲、錢老玉二十九歲、錢全林二十二歲、錢吉生三十一歲、錢芳初三十二歲、錢阿毛三十六歲、錢金平五十四歲、錢江二十一歲、以上均住落陽橋、封阿同四十七歲、錢惟全二十二歲、陳春望二十二歲、錢根元二十三歲、均嘉定人、</p>

<h3>哭俞蕙蓀先生</h3>
<p>— 武延琛</p>
<p>定海六横鄕耆宿俞蕙蓀先生。諱兆熊。晚號葦村。當前清科舉時代。時流專攻制藝。於經史不肯研究。至有儉腹之誚。先生獨喜讀古書。所著詩古文辭。枕經葄史。含英咀華。尤爲當時士林所傳誦。逢郡縣各書院試期。偶一投卷。輒冠其曹。乃文章憎命。鄕闈屢薦而不售。僅以廪貢生終其身。邑人欽先生學問。爭先延聘。敎授其子弟。故現在滬上紳商各界。出先生門下者。頗不乏人。與吾先叔父芝雨先生。爲文字交。最稱莫逆。吾家亦曾適館授餐。聘請敎授。故吾亦爲受業之一人。先生目本短視。因平時手不釋卷。晚歲遂盲其目。先生内行修潔。而秉性温和。從不與人相悟。而亦不喜與聞外事。徒以六橫孤島。居民多業魚鹽。向少讀書種子。先生學問文章。爲鄕人所矜式。遂被公舉爲村長。然雅非先生所願。島民智識簡陋。不解一切新政。另有負責之人。而專集矢於先生。七十老翁。遂以身殉。一家四人。復爲先生而殉焉。鳴呼暴民。旣殺其身。復火其廬。何太酷乎。吾與先生。十餘年前屢有簡書往來。近以俗冗。久不通郵。噩耗傳來。不禁放聲一哭。鳴呼。何天不福善人耶。抑天將喪斯文耶</p>
<h3>報屑</h3>
<p>— 天廬自東京寄</p>
<p>德京時報繪一天使。右手持錶。狀時光迅速。左手執鏡。示洞明燭照。報名特質。盡得風流。波京晨差報首字字母爲Ｋ。繪成一郵差。亦别饒雋趣。本報則採用木鐸爲標。天將以夫子爲鐸。警衆之意深矣。</p>
<p>美國報紙廣告收入。每年計在七億五千萬美金以上。英國報紙發行費用。一年總額爲三億一千萬金。巴黎所謂［三行啓事］。每報可得五萬法郎。日本新聞聯合社每年中國情報電費約需十萬金。</p>
<p>英國博物館中最古之新聞。爲［倫迦司脫］之數葉。在一五八八年發行。記載王</p>
<h3>蜜月保險</h3>
<p>— 嵇覲</p>
<p>西俗新婚後。夫婦必偕赴名勝地或大都會遊覽。謂之度蜜月。據友人云。美國紐約之派克來公司。係爲此項保險而設。其平時專注意於各種報紙。見有結婚啓事。則必遣人往說。商得新夫婦同意。並指定者爲目的地。凡沿途舟車之乘用。以及食宿之供張。均可隨時代辦。其保險費極廉。分普通特别兩種。聞普通每人每日二先令足矣。若有意外之事發生。該公司立即照章賠償損失。此亦别開生面之保險法也。</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲　女丨他們倆的愛情眞濃厚極了。曾立下誓來。說是［永久不變］。</p>
<p>乙女丨那麽他們已訂了婚沒有。</p>
<p>甲女丨好在愛情是永久的。所以再過二千年訂婚也不遲。</p>
<p>子丨父親。亞洲有幾條大河。幾座大山。</p>
<p>父丨這個我不大明白。</p>
<p>子丨父親。你眞太沒有智識。明天先生問我時。就要累我挨駡了。</p>
<p>甲丨明天你祖父出殯。你當然要執紼相送的。</p>

<h3>粤東博羅之游</h3>
<p>— 閩海伯牙</p>
<p>粤諺云。第一娶老婆。第二游博羅。斯二語。殊耐人思索。及余游博羅。始知其確與娶老婆有同味也。</p>
<p>博羅縣在粤之東。中有宏聖廟。每届元月十三日。爲聖誔。香火甚盛。遜清時。曾有禦祭之典者。故至今而游博羅之風未滅。每届此日。輒在渡頭來往。士女如雲。絡繹不絶。而愽羅浴日又爲羊城八景之一。廟居山腰。最起遠眺。日光自對海出。其芒耀與水波。互相輝映。幾疑身在扶桑。誠不愧爲羊城八景之一也。廟之下。爲一淺沙灘。離岸約二丈餘。水僅及踝。而游人衣履整齊。誰肯跣足者。遂爲一般珠娘投機之事業。是日也。各珠娘均作靚裝。御短褲。作由岸負人過廟之生涯。彼之收入固不菲。而亦爲一般被負者遍嘗鷄頭肉味矣。諺以娶老婆喻游博羅。蓋指此耳。</p>
<p>該廟是日出賣大宗者。爲紙製之鷄。號曰博羅鷄。凡游博羅歸者。人必手携一頭。謂此可能愽一年如意。並相傳每年必有仙人親臨其地。如王野人化裝賣湯糰。有仙骨者。食此湯糰。定可登仙云。又謂呂純陽亦曾作法。每年賣出製紙之愽羅鷄。其中定有一頭。能司晨而啼。此皆齊東野語。姑妄聽之而已。</p>
<h3>趣聞二則</h3>
<p>— 淞濱聽濤客</p>
<p>前日在京滬車中。長途無俚。偶聆一座客閒談。得趣聞二則。或以爲虚妄。然談者言之鑿鑿。似非臆造。以其事頗趣。因涉筆錄之。以投本談。</p>
<p>機警之夫婦　霞飛路霞飛坊某宅。於某日忽遭二盜光臨。一盜手勃朗林。先入室。威脅室中人交出保險箱鑰匙。男子正猶豫間。其婦從容謂盜曰。勿傷生。鑰出可也。因謂其夫往取鑰。盜見如此。以爲懦怯之輩。乃執鎗隨男子後。婦亦隨盜後。盜以其弱女子也。不之意。不料刹那間。婦突舉足猛踼盜執鎗之肘。鎗墮地。盜驟驚。不知所措。婦即上前用力擒住。而其夫亦遽迴身拾鎗對盜。盜不敢動。在外望</p>
<p>紅氍毹</p>
<h3>觀荀慧生香羅帶劇記</h3>
<p>— 老拙</p>
<p>七日晚觀劇於大舞臺。大軸香羅帶。荀慧生新劇中佳構之一也。戲情絶似梆子劇之三疑計。惟三疑計演至賠罪爲止。斯劇賠罪後。接唐通從征。途次酒店遇盜。縳以香羅帶。斷首委屍而去。以致羣疑盜屍爲唐屍。差役且誣逮唐婦與其戚杜某。適唐之館師已掇高科。授巡按。巡遊是邑。讞呈。頓觸憶昔年深夜叩門之事。因强判决以姦殺論括。行將就刑。會唐歸。寃乃白。下半截戲情又頗似斬賣娥。新劇之難脫舊劇窠曰。大率類是。第就戲言戲。慧生所飾唐婦林氏。被夫强逼深夜往叩陸師之門。及公差誣指與其戚杜某通姦殺夫各節。無端横逆。空谷米風。寫無形之悲苦。倍難於有形之悲苦。而作者始終抱定幽嫺貞靜之態度。深合劇中人之身分。且演來不激不隨。但覺無限酸辛。所謂心比秋蓮苦十分。慧生眞善寫生也。唱詞首塲西皮三眼。含蓄新腔。異常動聽。催妝之二六。詞旨悽惋。唱亦如之。法塲反二搖板八句。唱腔逐句變換。無板難於有板。却爲慧生所專長。細聆慧生發音雖細。而吐字極清。抑揚收放。輕重疾徐。悉恊音律而臻妥洽。足徵年來功候之鋭進也。輔以張春彥飾莽丈夫之唐通。金仲仁飾頭巾氣重之陸世科。馬祿飾市井無賴之杜某。適如其才。允稱佳構。</p>
<p>風之盜。探身入視。則勃朗林舉頭。祗得束手就擒。說者謂夫婦二人。諒均善技擊。不然。何精悍若是。</p>
<p>巧遇自家人　醫士某。識一浪人某甲。且亦曾爲治病。一日夜間。醫士大衣厚帽。踽踽獨行。於弄堂口突遇剝猪玀者。正掙扎間。則燈光下。固素識者也。醫士因笑曰。今遇自家人。將若之何。某甲慚無以答。醫士乃解嚢贈數幣而去。</p>
<h3>赤松子</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>昨於王君春宴席上。識一菜。厥味鮮美。酸香沁肺。外裏黄泥。曰赤松子。以其形似。坐客皆老　驟賭之下。均不知爲何物。詫爲嘗所未嘗。苦不知其食法。以詢王君。君曰。是不難。子等以竹筷去其泥。而揭其紙。先吸其湯。更去其殼。而蘸醋以食。當别有妙味也。於是坐客皆躍躍欲試。一時竹筷聲。呼吸聲。剝殼聲。同時雜作。皆以爲破天荒妙菜。請述其製法。王君曰。此余家肴。法以生鷄蛋一枚。磨一小洞。注以蝦肉。益以醬油。佐以味母。内層工作旣畢。復以硬紙封其洞。辣醬塗於殼上。貯醋鉢中浸三四分鐘。取貯盌中。隔湯煮之。便熟。其味之佳。無殊山珍海味也。歸而紀之。餘味津津。不欲舉以自秘。爰紀之以供同好。</p>
<h3>情急智生</h3>
<p>— 雙呆</p>
<p>人行馬路中。苟爲雉妓所嬲。於無可擺脫之際。祇須輕輕語之曰。吾正在渾身生瘡。彼必釋手他去。余曾屢試而屢騐。</p>
<p>錢店棧司。送解銀洋（不布包言、籘笆者此法不適用）或於中途遇盜匪搶刦。即大聲僞對曰。包内是軍火。·····爾等幸毋誤會。盜聞軍火。猶豫不遽下手。即放聲連喊軍火。易以引動行人與探捕注意。或可倖免也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一二七）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>

<h3>棉價高昂之由來</h3>
<p>美棉回漲···漢帮做多</p>
<p>棉市轉定、美棉來電回漲、本埠市氣向上、漢帮因地價堅昂、紛向期棉市塲上大批購進做多、故市盤微見增高、但現棉銷路未能十分暢旺、蓋各廠訂購印棉已不少、本棉目前似無急辦之必要、不過有一部份以美棉銷費減少、心思看低、日商多頭亦己了結、棉市前途、一時恐難安穩、</p>
<p>漢標回漲四五錢　期棉前市開盤、以美棉回漲三四十磅音、塲中賣風大减、散户紛起抵補、各月漲四五錢、二三盤多頭了結、市盤驟跌二·三·四錢、結果祇漲一二錢、午後因漢帮買進市情稍堅、各月又漲二錢半至三錢、全日成交統計四萬一千九百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、漢標收盤漲跌　存賬數　收盤漲跌　存賬數</p>

<h3>美棉回漲四十磅音</h3>
<p>昨日美棉因利物浦消息良好及空户抵補、買氣旺盛、計期貨漲三十三至四十磅音、現貨漲三十五磅音、英棉期貨漲五六點、現貨漲六點、埃及棉現貨漲十五點、印棉因日漸　進而堅、計平果爾漲一羅比、違期漲二羅比、奥姆辣漲三羅比、遠期漲三至四羅比、白羅溪近遠期漲二羅比、原電錄左、（十日電）</p>

<h3>糧食中次粳獨漲角許</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮來船不多、計十七八號、市銷稍活、北粳高貨仍開十八元八角左右、惟中次等粳、因銷場見殷、轉漲近角、薄稻到銷兩平價無上落、祗特高貨續堅而已、羊杜秈本街因洋米接抵而銷滞、行情勉守原盤、船底貨稍有修削、客埠秈買户不旺、且揀選蔡嚴、大盤雖不動、而市形平常、變陰元到接去淡、價小角譜、全日市勢、次粳米獨堅耳</p>
<p>滬南　河下到源仍稀、銷場略佳、常鍚北粳高貨竟少、故普通好貨開十八元關左、與前盤無若何升降、蘇同機粳跌勢已定、去化帶爽、平穩之象、市帮薄稻及亭林等早稻刻亦轉平、緣北市趨堅貨客因而扳售、交易不爽、羊杜秈街銷暢滞不一、如存貨不多之買户、吃價稍寛、行情有半角出入、變元交易寥寥、價格呆疲、陰元吊胃欠暢、普通者開十五元一二角、</p>
<h3>洋米步漲角外</h3>
<p>期貨亦好二三分</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况續佳、因市上存底甚枯、來源須四五日後始可抵埠、在此缺貨之際、適有寗波本街北洋各帮暢辦、市面乃見逐步上展、昨現洋祗開一號西貢千外包、價十四元二角半至十四元二角、二號五百包、價十三元九角半、均比前市各漲角外、期貨有寗波及内地爭辦價亦比前市好起二三分、售開西貢一萬餘包、小絞二萬三千包、以路貨及近期爲主云、</p>
<h3>粉市近堅遠疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、近期堅穩、遠期平疲二三月份、終以存底不豐、廠家空碼不肯多放、雖本埠各廠存底、據私人之推測、粉麥合計約在二百萬包外無如出數已有限度、原料之到頭、則無增添之希望、故於陳粉之抛售、當持　住之態、市况之復穩、即此故也、遠期初以洋麥微好四角左右、人心頗俏、旋則抛數見湧、又轉疲滞六月份以最近之趨勢言、二錢半一關、當可立住也、結果本下月份較前日各回好一分、四月份好五厘、五月份好二厘半、六月份小五厘、七月份好二厘半云</p>
<h3>期麥市呈清堅</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤、各月份似趨挺穩、上午因洋麥報價微好、粉市亦由疲轉定、故人心己不若前虚滞、迨至下午開盤、因新買户並不甚湧、抛户亦稀、各盤交易、甚覺冷淡、觀此後局面、近期當以粉銷爲轉移、遠期則半看天時、半看内地帮之態度、因麥苗如果漸漸豐秀、全部人心、當一致有所變動也、結果本月份上午好一分、三月份好二分、四月份好一分、六月份好一分、七月份好二分、現麥市面、特高之貨、廠胃需求仍切、故喊高二三分不等、開清江浦麥五兩三錢、黄喬麥五兩三錢二分、漢口麥五兩二錢半、五兩二錢、五兩一錢半、五兩零五分、次至四兩九錢半、共開四千餘包云、</p>
<h3>疋頭實銷日形發展</h3>
<p>疋頭市况、昨日漲落互見、實銷南華各埠日漸活動、尤以汕頭帮進胃最强、昨成交一百五十餘件、就中以藍條色汀花標等爲大宗、福州因時局未臻安寗、辦意較淡、温州·台州昨細布頗有採辦、月雁爲八兩五錢、世樂烏七兩六錢、雙龍珠七兩四錢半、本街交易、亦大進步、常州杭州嘉興等處内地客家均已紛紛到滬、所以昨公平呌莊、一致猛漲、惟東貨受三品下落影響、稍形見軟、花標小有五分左右、昨冲深爸四兩二錢已多肯脫手、細嗶嘰百子圖風波亭開二錢四分、亦較前略小、而西貨被呌莊漲風激動、人心更堅、故紅盤開價、暫時尚無下落、府綢本街需要甚殷、昨進條子及素地雜色一百多件、素洋紗因價高關係、寫定者較往年爲少、昨義記五鳳樓玉蝴蝶元色均開十六兩、秃白十四兩五錢、金危危秃元十三兩五錢、泰和如意天官十二兩五錢云、</p>
<h3>絲茶魯黄灰經來源停阻</h3>
<p>靑島施行土貨出口公秤稅所致</p>
<p>黄灰絲經　爲魯省特產、向由靑島及烟台兩埠裝輪運滬、由駐滬莊客抛售與各洋行、轉行出口　邇來黄灰絲經來源忽告停阻、滬莊紛電產地查詢、茲接復電大致謂茲因靑島當局施行土貨出口公秤稅、商界羣起反對而官廳堅持執行、故特停業罷運、以圖抵制、黄灰絲經　一時恐難裝運云、</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論</p>
<h3>上海最近汽車數丁祖澤</h3>
<p>按本埠英法兩工部局車務處汽車登記之數量。一年以來。竟增加百分之二十。其進步可云迅速矣。去年一月一日。本埠兩租界登記之汽車。包括客車貨車與機器脚踏車三種。總數爲一萬零一百六十七輛。今年一月一日。則總計有一萬二千三百八十輛。此外各車之縣試車營業照會者。尚不在内焉。</p>
<p>上記一萬二千三百八十輛汽車中。可分别爲約四百餘不同之牌號。其中更可分出最著名之牌號約二十種。此二十種汽車之數量。幾佔全數之大半。</p>
<p>本埠經售汽車之行家約有十五家。所售汽車之牌號。多數爲福特·雪佛蘭·甓克·馬律斯·克雷斯勒·飛霞·雪鐵龍·蘭腦·奥斯丁·此外尚有經售運貨汽車與機器脚踏車之行家若干。</p>
<p>照上述數量而觀。一年來所增者計有二千二百十三輛。接諸實際。竟相矛盾。蓋本埠各汽車行家。每年售出之新汽車。不過二千輛。且售出最多者。僅有兩家。一家計約七百輛。其他一家則年售約五百輛。</p>
<p>然就汽車商所述。則别有原因在。蓋近年來汽車營業。大半係以舊車換新車之交易。車主購得新車後。僅以舊照會懸於新車。不復向工部局重新登記。倘該舊車仍在本埠售出。則此第二車主向工部局登記時。方察出增添一輛。然多數舊車之易新車者。不再發見於本埠道路上。此等舊車有轉運内地者。有廢棄無用者。亦有無法售出者。若依海關進口之汽車數爲根據。亦不能準確。因進口之汽車不盡銷售於上海。是以欲考查本埠每年所增之新汽車數量。誠非易事也。</p>
<p>茲列表於次以示兩租界昨今兩年一月一日登記之各種車輛詳數</p>
<p>英租界　　法租界</p>
<p>一九二九年一九三０年　一九二九年一九三０年</p>
<p>自用客車　四一七一　四七八三　二六一三　三０七八營業客車　三九三　　五四一　　三四二　　四六五自用貨車　六一五　　七０一　五二八　　六四八營業貨車　四九八　　八三三　二四一　　四八九機器脚踏車　六二四　七三七　一四二　　一一五</p>
<p>由上表而觀。除法租界機器脚踏車减少外。各種汽車皆有增加。</p>
<p>再就本埠著名汽車而言。以前數年中皆以璧克汽車佔最多數。鼎盛之時。計共有九百八十二輛。不幸在三月前竟縮少爲九百四十一輛。福特汽車與馬律斯汽車則猛進不已。本年内首席地位。將爲福特汽車或馬律斯汽車所佔有。雪佛蘭汽車亦爲一後起之秀。據就客車之登記者。現今福特爲八百二十五輛。馬律斯七百九十四輛。雪佛蘭六百二十五輛。此三種汽車。在去年十月一日登記者。福特僅七百七十八輛。馬律斯七百七十二輛。雪佛蘭五百九十一輛云。</p>
<p>下列一表。係就本埠各著名汽車以數量爲先後之表。</p>
<p>英租界　法租界　總數</p>
<p>福特　八○三　六七一　一四七四雪佛蘭　四九八　四○五　九八二璧克　　六三九　三四三　九八二馬律斯　四八七　三五二　八三九奥佛蘭　三○二　一六九　四七一飛霞　　三○○　一三六　四三六司都培克二九七　一一五　四一二雪鐵龍　一七五　二二五　四○○奥斯丁　二二四　一一六　三四○愛山克水一八一　一四二　三二三蘭腦　　一三五　一八一　三一六納喜　　一九八　一○一　二九九克雷斯勒一一五　　九九　二一四以上除璧克·納喜·與克雷斯勒三種汽車外。其餘均有運貨汽車連計在内。且内中八種係美國貨。二種爲英國貨。二種爲法國貨。一種爲意大利貨。故可知本埠大多數汽車爲美國製造。蓋因美國汽車加速甚快。車身長而寛。汽缸亦大。雖他國極力模倣。各國人士仍多購用美國汽車。但本埠機器脚踏車。則以英國製造者爲多數。</p>
<p>汽車數量。雖年有增加。然本年份殊未可樂觀。因近來金貴銀賤之影響。汽車原價。至少須增加二成也。</p>
<h3>德國汽車事業槪論黄影呆</h3>
<p>近來歐州各國之汽車事業。與美國競爭頗烈。此固爲人盡皆知之事也。至於歐洲各國之中。德國之汽車事業。年來亦日形發展。而德國各汽車廠最近之營業政策。在提高出品之内容。以杜國外汽車之輸入。根據德國某報所載。上年四五兩月國外汽車之進口。總數爲二·五二六輛。值價七·五七四·○○○馬克而一九二八年四五兩月。則汽車之進口者計有三·六三六輛。值價一四·六八五·○○○馬克。相形之下。可知德國汽車之進口。上年已較前年减少多多。據海關之報。去年運入之汽車。僅抵前年三分之一。其餘則均爲車身及底盤在反對方面言之。去年一年之中。最初之四月。内地汽車之輸入。爲三七·九九七輛。而一九·二八年同時則僅有二五·三九四輛。可知德國年來汽車之銷路。非但不見衰落。反逐年發展。不過國外汽車之輸入。行將漸次减少耳。是亦足證德國本廠貨之發展也。惟德國各汽車廠。大都有外人之投資。如美國之通用及福特。在德國均有分廠之開設。故以實際而言。德國各汽車廠。近來雖日形發展。而一部分權利。仍爲外人所攫去也。</p>
<p>德國之汽車事業。旣如上述。而德國之機車事業。近來亦日漸漸逹。蓋德國人民。近來咸喜駕馭機車。故機車之產量。亦日見增見。即以柏林ＶｏｓｓｉｓｈｅＺｌｉｌｌｕｎｇ之報告而言。則上年自一月至六月。前後六個月中。德國各廠。所產機車。總數爲一一五·○○○輛。而前年一月至六月。則僅有七○·○○○輛。相差三分之一以上。且德人所駕者。大都喜用嬌小之機車。故各廠所產機車。近來爲迎合社會心理。易於推銷起見。亦以小號爲多。如○ｐｅｌ廠及其他各汽車廠。所製機車。皆採此種政策。至於大號機車。售價在美金五○○元以上者。去年自一月一日至七月一日。六個月中央共計產出四一·五○○輛。較之一九二八年同時减少百分之十。在反對方面言之。德人購買機車之時。近來專喜選擇自七五元至一五○元者也。故小號機車之產量。年來突形增加。最近二年來之產量。較之一九二七年竟有增十倍之多。我人聞之。得不爲之驚奇乎。德國機車之註册。以全世界而言。數量之多。可佔第二位。截至一九二九年一月一日。各國機車之註册。英國之總數爲七二四·八三輛。德國四六五·○○○輛。法國三二○·○○○輛。美國一二一·六五六輛。故除英國以外。當推德爲最多也。</p>
<p>因德國汽車事業之發展而受其影響者。當推波蘭一國。而波蘭之公共汽車事業。其推展之速。尤屬令人驚異也。據美國包立施商會之調查。則一九二五年波蘭僅有公共汽車四一二輛。而目前已有二·九○○輛矣。其中以美國製造者居其多數。除瓦蕯以外。波蘭各大城鎭。如ＰｏｐｎａｎＬｗｏｗＣｒａｃｏｗ，Ｗｉｌｎａ，Ｌｕｂ，ｌｉｎ，Ｃｐｅｓｏｃｈｏｗｇ，Ｂｉｎｌｙｓｔｏｌｋ等地。均有公共汽車線交通。凡鄕村城鎭之旅客。隨處可以搭車。交通之便。不言而諭矣。且此種汽車線。與各鐵路均互相接班。每日所載搭客。總數竟有一六八·○○○人之多。而火車上之搭客。則僅及三分之一也。</p>
<h3>萬里長征之福特車霖</h3>
<p>任重致遠不可多得</p>
<p>地亞旁福特汽車公司。接得全球各處之報告。盛稱福特新車質料優美。行動超赿。最近在匃亞利之斯極特城。德維猶克汽車俱樂部所主持之［旅行比賽］競賽中。福特汽車曾膺第一及第五兩獎。其他三獎爲非美國製之汽車所獲。此賽所行之路線。爲前此所未見。其途徑在昔係騎行者所取。是以駕車者及車身兩皆任重。全途地面崎嶇不平。又有池沼泥潭等。殊爲高低不平。礙難駕駛。一在半途中隨時有停車之記號。出其不意。令進行之汽車停止。與賽之車均須隨時將車煞住。</p>
<p>獲首獎者爲保爾克塞司所駕之車。計得最高一千零九十七分。次獎得一○七九分。三獎一○五四分。四獎一○四八分。五獎亦係福特汽車所獲得一千零四十五分。去秋七月芬蘭之西納局開地方。福特汽車於七次比賽中獲獎有六次之多。比賽之地點。近鮑司尼灣海邊與賽之各種汽車均係標準式者。福特駕車所未參予者祗第五而已。當第二次比賽時。其途徑長十基羅密逹。所參加者咸保齊整之跑車。交獎即爲福特汽車所獲。此車於首次比賽時亦曾參加。祗將車上風屏除去。而略有變更耳。</p>
<p>福特Ａ模型汽車之車主中。以紐約勃魯克林證劵商。利宏朗格梅氏。所作長途旅行報告爲最饒興趣。朗氏乘其轎式福特汽車。由城市出發。往西海岸一帶。其車上之速率計祗九十英里。而於返來之前。此車竟行八千七百零九英里之多。車上載四客。合重六百八十餘磅車後裝大行李箱四件。及零星雜件不計。</p>
<p>朗格梅氏於函中自述云。［余儕行程八千七百零九英里。舉凡最佳與最劣之道路咸所經行。惟此汽車則無山不越。無路不行。至於天氣變遷。於此車亦無多問題也。余儕出入勃魯山之雪中。及熱不可當之馬海河沙漠地。行至新墨西哥界時。大雨滂沱。幾於無夜不雨。道路竟爲雨水所冲淹。而吾車仍能越之而過。所不同者即泥污上翻車身。引擎之中留一泥印而已。車行所經者如黄石公園。桃司麥脫。麥立卜司。葛落湖。大卡容。克立夫地惠勒司。色沙漠。潘德非脫。福來司脫。大城市如舊錄山。樂士安極立司。聖羅意司。干薩司城及波蘭特等等是也。］</p>
<p>除上述之八千七百零九英里長途行程而外。又有非洲開潑城工程師馬根與其妻之長途汽車行程。全途經行之處爲程七千五百英里。馬氏與其妻深入南非腹地至十四星期之久。馬根氏此行之代步即係福特連貨車一輛。按馬氏言萬里長征幾頻不測。其妻係唯一之白種婦人深入此種危險之地。所遇所見光怪陸離。筆難盡述。全程中最感困難者即係熱度過高。灼燒難當。日出之時高升至一百二十五度。日入之時亦在五十二度左右。鮮生之食物片時即行敗壞。所頼以度活者祇罐頭食物耳。</p>

<h3>浙江公路近况楊修范</h3>
<p>余伯父供職於浙江省公路局。去歲余適因事赴杭。下榻於該局中數夜。因得悉關於省公路局所管轄下之各綫近况甚詳。茲抒述於左。</p>
<p>㈠蕭紹段　爲前浙江省道局計畫中浙閩幹線之一段。自錢塘江南岸之江邊站起。至紹興之五雲門爲止。啣接商辦之紹曹嵊汽車路。全路共長九十華里。内經過西興·蕭山·轉壩頭·吟龍閘·衙前·錢清·秦望·阮社·柯橋·尊儀橋·西郭門·紹興·昌安門·等站。而至五雲門。每次需時二小時許。售價一元二角。全日共計往返三十次。其餘各站間尚有區間車。一如火車之定章。全路各站之客票行李總收入。平均每日在二千元以上。乘客平均每日總數一千四百餘人。該路爲杭紹往來之要道。旅客之取道於陸者。莫不乘車。故旅客趨蹌滿站。勢如潮湧。客車開出時。銜接數輛。坐無虚位。故爲全省各路中之最發達者。</p>

<h3>汽車運輸爲國富之源吉人</h3>
<p>美國素稱富强之邦。工商發達。出品精良。各國人士均視爲財地。前往經商者。年以萬計。近來嘗有海外商業巨子及銀行家組織考察圑。赴美調查工業發達之實情。將其所得結果。供獻母國。從事改良工商。振興實業。</p>
<p>今歐澳遠東各國政府。對於美國之汽車事業及其稅制。頗爲注意。亦有選派專員赴美考察之舉。以期發展全國道路及汽車運輸事務。</p>
<p>考察美國之官員及環游全洲之仕女。莫不稱美國汽車事業之偉大與其國庫之富裕有密切之關係。美國人士投資於汽車事業之總額。共計美金三十萬萬元。每年出品之價值約在美金五十萬萬以上。各廠之男女工人。亦有四百萬之衆。美國汽車事業範圍之大。爲世鮮見。美國人士對於汽車運輸。已有相當之認識。蓋交通之便利。有關國家之盛衰。社會之進步。經濟之發展。均受極大之影響。今北美之趨勢。即在擴充全國道路。貫通各州。庶使人民共享利益。人人可置汽車。</p>
<p>汽車運輸之發展。對於商務營業。咸感便利。但於鐵路收入。當有巨大之損失。蓋貨車與公共汽車。價廉而迅速。便利而舒適。遠勝火車。因此乘用汽車者日多。火車乏人顧問。鐵路受此無限競爭。營業日益蕭條。稅收大爲减色。於是有數國家起而設法援救。令國會制定立法。對於汽車事業。抽徵重稅。以恢鐵道營業。如增政府原有之稅率。</p>
<p>美國之趨勢則不然。今之新式靈敏運輸方法。頗受熱烈之歡迎。雖鐵路公司亦利用運貨汽車拖載貨物。行駛短程。更用公共汽車。接送乘客。裝運行李。政府旣不頒定法加以阻難。反竭力鼓吹從事提倡。故今美國大道之廣。車輛之多。交通之便。營業之旺。决非他國所能及。</p>
<p>美國各種路面車輛公司。確不能與汽車競爭。然仍努力維持。或改用汽車。按其結果汽車事業之利益。較他種車業之出息。超過數倍。此美　汽車事業所以有如是發達之緣由也。</p>
<p>今美國聯邦政府。鑒於道路之需要。已將巨欵。分發各州。建修大道。此外各州並有長年建築道路費。由省政府擬定。經國會議决後。再行發付。</p>
<p>築路之政策。有關地方之安寗。工商之發達。利益孔多。可以編成厚册。試以農民論之。道路通達。運輸物產便利。獲益豐多。再以商情言之。道路所經。地產價值加高。物品利市十倍。</p>
<p>各國考察圑及專員。將美國交通現狀實地調查後。始得美國之富强。全賴汽車運輸之發達。已無異言。他日歸國。提倡汽車事業。必有偉大之供獻。</p>
<p>美國人士最初之觀念。視汽車爲消耗品與奢侈品。决非普通人所能購置。近年以來。人民深知汽車之利益。用途之經濟。態度驟改。人人均置汽車。故今美國車輛之總額。已達五百萬輛之多矣。</p>
<p>美國汽車事業。將來必更振興。加以城市改造。道路增加。汽車之銷路。必定一日千里。</p>
<p>美國通用汽車製造總廠。爲世界最大之汽車製造廠。資本計四十萬萬美金。工人有四百萬之衆。各國分廠已有二十四處之多。出產旣多。質料又美。機件堅强。銷路最廣。足供全球汽車界之需要。故美國通用汽車製造總廠之服務最爲美滿。爲世所公認者也。</p>

Shigemitsu first repeatedly contacted Song Ziwen in Nanjing and Shanghai, expressing that the Japanese side is willing to agree to China implementing a national tariff, but a reciprocal approach should be stipulated in the form of a treaty under the principle of equality. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also discussed this case in detail, believing that a special customs agreement could be concluded without the need to use a treaty form, to avoid involving other issues. Therefore, there were some discrepancies in opinions.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>World Economy and Unemployment Problems (Silent)</h3>
<p>The unstable economic conditions in various countries and the sudden increase in the number of unemployed workers are the two major problems facing the world today. In fact, these two problems are mutually reinforcing. The impact of the European War initially plunged the people into poverty due to various war losses. Resources were depleted, and the proper course of the economy was destroyed. Communication was cut off. This was one period. In the following years, after various countries worked hard to develop production and increase trade, economic conditions were temporarily stabilized. However, whether this stability can continue for a long time and whether it can restore the prosperity of the pre-war period without internal unstable crises, no one can determine. Why? The uneven progress of production and trade in various countries causes economic friction. In one direction, there is competition for market dominance. In the other direction, there is conflict between the capital and labor classes. Furthermore, in terms of the principle of supply and demand, production and consumption should develop equally in order to be stable. If productivity progresses rapidly and exceeds consumption capacity, then overproduction can cause panic. The problem of worker unemployment comes with this phenomenon. For example, in the United States and Japan today, production and trade are developing rapidly, and their economies seem to be very stable. However, the current economic situation in Japan and the United States often hides crises, and the number of unemployed workers has suddenly increased to the same extent as in other countries with less developed production, or even more so. This only speaks of the normality of imbalance. If we speak of changes, unexpected storms can occur at any time, and the financial market can be shaken at any time. Therefore, I say that the two problems of the instability of the world economy and worker unemployment are interconnected as one and are related to all countries. Those who seek to remedy these problems cannot only care about their own country, think only for their own country, and not ask about the state of the world.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Airmail Transportation Problems</h3>
<p>New Contacts with American Investment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The question of the abolition or revision of the contract between China National Aviation Corporation and American Transpacific Corporation is very complicated. The Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will hold a second meeting to decide on a solution. Currently, American Fairman Company is contacting the Chinese transportation authorities to invest in airmail transportation. The conditions are for joint management in nature, without any compensation. If there are losses, both parties will bear them equally. The postage rates will follow the practice of the Universal Postal Union, calculated at 20 grams, and the charge will be 12 cents, regardless of the distance flown. According to the original contract with Transpacific Corporation, the charge was 15 cents per 10 grams, and interest coupons had to be given according to the interests stipulated in the contract. Therefore, the postal service suffered great losses. Compared to the contract with Transpacific Corporation, the conditions proposed by Fairman Company can reduce China's losses by 80 to 90 percent. The Ministry of Communications is currently considering whether to accept Fairman Company's suggestions and how to ensure that one party develops domestic transportation and the other maintains aviation services, a win-win solution. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Southwest Road Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Telegrams Requesting Slight Modifications</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang telegraphed Sun Ke that Sichuan Province is close to Kangzang, rich in products, and extremely rich in minerals. The British built a branch line of the Assam-Bengal Railway, starting from Galagong station and entering Darjeeling, to create a passage from India to Tibet. Russia is further advancing the Central Asian Railway, traversing Xinjiang and connecting to Tibet. With the southern border defense becoming increasingly urgent, for the sake of national defense, transportation, military affairs, politics, and economy, the Southwest Road Construction Plan should be slightly modified. First, the Yu-Han Railway should be built as the warp, and the Xiang-Dian and Yue-Dian lines should be built as the weft. He listed nine reasons, requesting their adoption. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Prepares to Unify the Currency System</h3>
<p>Xu Kan Comes to Shanghai to Contact Business Circles</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has set July 1 as the date for implementing a unified currency system and abolishing taels and using yuan. Because this matter has a close relationship with the business community, Xu Kan, the director of the Currency Department, has been tasked with contacting business associations and the public in Shanghai to seek their opinions in order to avoid difficulties arising at the last minute. Regarding the overall reorganization issue: 1) To unify the quantity and value of subsidiary coins and silver dollars; 2) To crack down on privately-run banks issuing banknotes indiscriminately; 3) Subsidiary copper coins with different weights and values should be destroyed and recast. These are all planned to be carried out in sequence. Furthermore, because the currency systems of the provinces are extremely chaotic, changing old habits requires the unified assistance of local authorities to avoid difficulties. It is proposed to request the Central Government to issue a circular order to all provinces to comply, prohibiting all private minting and cracking down on various banknotes with chaotic currency systems. As for the implementation steps and phased plans, foreign consultants and financial experts are currently studying concrete plans, which will then be submitted to the Central Government for review and implementation. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Health Conference</h3>

(11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Beiping Municipal Demobilization Movement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The demobilization movement will begin with disguised speeches at 1 PM this afternoon and continue tomorrow. A general meeting and recreational events will be held the day after tomorrow. The military and police will specially maintain order from this afternoon. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The declaration of the demobilization movement in Beiping Municipality states: "Since the national army implemented the reorganization and disbandment, several months have passed. Not only has the reorganization and disbandment failed to be implemented, but the recruitment of soldiers is often heard. Our current troop size is about 2.5 million people, and it costs about 500 million yuan each year. The annual income is 450 million yuan. Repaying foreign debt costs 100 million yuan. The remaining amount is used for military expenses and is still short 150 million yuan. Direct taxes are insufficient, and additional taxes are imposed. If additional taxes are not enough, there will be war. The more we fight, the poorer and more chaotic we become. The result will not stop until the country is destroyed. Please be aware that all armed comrades who support demobilization should sincerely support it, and this association must overthrow all those who oppose demobilization." (11th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disguised speeches for demobilization, the garrison headquarters informed that they cannot protect during the current period of martial law, so please be cautious. It has now been decided to stop the event, but the declaration will still be issued. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>London Naval Conference Discusses Submarine Issues</h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Advocate Abolition</p>
<p>France and Japan Express Opposition</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: This morning, the general representatives gathered at St. James's Palace and issued a communique, stating that the order of business for the day is: (1) To convene a plenary session tomorrow to discuss the submarine issue; (2) To conclude the various issues currently under consideration and prepare a report to be sent to the general representatives of each country; (3) To actively continue the discussions between the representatives. Tomorrow's plenary session will be chaired by the British Prime Minister. As for Britain's views on submarines, they will be presented by British Naval Secretary Alexander. There have been numerous discussions between representatives today, and experts have continued to meet to consider a compromise on the method of limiting total tonnage and classified tonnage. The experts' report will be submitted to the First Committee on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th: The Naval Conference held a plenary meeting today to discuss the submarine issue. The conference room was packed. First, British Prime Minister MacDonald stood up to announce that the Expert Committee on total tonnage and classified tonnage had completed its work and that a plenary meeting could be convened in a few days to discuss the matter. Then, British Naval Secretary Alexander began to discuss the submarine issue, saying that, based on Britain's wartime experience, submarines are of no value for coastal defense and are mostly used for offensive purposes and attacks on merchant ships. Britain needs to defend more ships than any other country, but now it intends to abandon the protection provided by submarines without reservation. The countries participating in the conference have built or are building submarines of more than 400 tons, which is a huge undertaking. Abolishing submarines will greatly reduce military spending and indirectly make the equipment of destroyers more economical, since destroyers are used to counter submarines. Moreover, submarines often have accidents in peacetime. Britain has lost 570 people since 1918, which is not in the country's interest. If the conference does not approve the abolition, Britain intends to limit their type and number and propose very practical conditions to prevent them from being used to destroy commerce. Britain also intends to reiterate the 1922 Washington Convention banning submarine attacks on merchant ships. After Alexander finished speaking, Stimson stood up and said that years of reflection had crystallized into a universal belief that the inhumane use of submarines should be terminated. The time has come to discuss the issue frankly. Some say that submarines are purely defensive weapons, but they have been known to attack far from their own country. If so, how can this be justified? Others say that submarines are cheap, but they do not know that the cost per ton is three or four times higher than that of the largest warships. The abuse of submarines was the root cause of drawing the Western Hemisphere into the vortex of the most intense European war in history. The purpose of this conference to restrict this weapon is also the key point of convening the conference, etc. Next, Japanese representative, Finance Minister Admiral Takarabe, said that Japan's terrain is characterized by widely distributed islands, and it is more economical to use submarines for self-defense. However, Japan is sincere in supporting the suggestion that declaring weapons used for legitimate self-defense in war as illegal is unacceptable by law.</p>

<h3>Philippine Opium Trade Report</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 10th: Today, the Opium Committee considered the US government's report on the 1927-28 Philippine opium trade.

<p>Electric Communication News Agency, London, 10th: Regarding the submarine issue, the French side clearly stated the following today: (1) The Luther Agreement does not have any special provisions regarding submarine warfare using gas. (2) Considering a submarine commander who violates the agreement as a pirate is meaningless and may be necessary. (3) We intend to assert that the countries that have approved the agreement have no need to be responsible for the actions of such naval officers. (4) We should argue that submarines and surface warships should be subject to the rules of combat agreement. There is no difference between the firing of a submarine and the firing of a destroyer under the cover of smoke. (5) We believe that the subtle attack of an aircraft, the attack of a destroyer under smoke, and the attack of a submarine are identical in nature. The former two are no different from the latter in terms of their cunning use of insidious weapons.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: The Naval Conference will have important developments this week.

<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Provinces to Suppress Banditry</h3>
<p>Complete Suppression Mandated Within the 19th Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior, considering that the people's suffering is most severe due to disturbances by bandits, has drafted a method for suppression and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for presentation to the National Government, ordering all provinces to implement it earnestly. The Executive Yuan, finding the proposed method feasible, has instructed the provincial governments to comply. The order reads as follows: "It has been reported by the Ministry of Interior that the people's suffering is most severe due to disturbances by bandits. Rectifying internal affairs requires the suppression of bandits as the urgent task. Without eliminating bandits, all governance is impossible, and the people cannot live in peace. The Ministry has previously issued an assessment table for counties to eliminate bandits, to be implemented by all provinces. The method of elimination should address both the symptoms and the root causes. County magistrates should fulfill their duties, and provincial government chairmen should bear overall responsibility. It is requested that the National Government issue a clear order to all provinces, limiting them to the 19th year to completely suppress bandits everywhere. First, the provincial government chairmen should set a deadline for bandit suppression and report it to the central government for record. Within this deadline, if any troops stationed in the province fail to effectively suppress bandits, the provincial government chairman should impeach them based on facts. If any troops stationed in the province do not obey the provincial government's command and hinder bandit suppression, the provincial government chairman should report it based on facts. If any officials fail to prevent or suppress bandits, or even harbor bandits to harm the people or drive people into banditry, the provincial government chairman should severely punish them. After the set deadline, if banditry is not suppressed, the provincial government chairman should impeach himself and await punishment, with the civil affairs director bearing joint responsibility. If large, notorious bandit gangs roam across several provinces, the central government should appoint troops to be responsible for suppressing them within a deadline. Currently, bandits are causing disturbances everywhere. Unless the provincial governments first have the determination to be responsible for eliminating bandits, it is insufficient to clear the evil atmosphere of banditry. Unless a deadline is set and implemented swiftly and decisively, it is insufficient to arouse the determination of provincial governments to be responsible for eliminating bandits. Whether the proposal is appropriate is hereby submitted to the Executive Yuan for presentation to the National Government for review and implementation." Upon review, the proposed methods are feasible and have been forwarded to the National Government for compliance. Now, an instruction has been received stating, "The report is noted. Approved as proposed. The Executive Yuan shall order the provincial governments to earnestly comply to ensure local peace." In addition to separate orders, the provincial government is ordered to immediately comply, report for verification.]</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters' Telegram to the Korean Nationalist Party</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Korean Nationalist Party, since the so-called Japan-Korea annexation, Japanese imperialists have used every possible means to oppress your fellow countrymen. The recent Gwangju Incident, with its shootings, injuries, and tortures, is an extreme display of brutality that has aroused indignation among all humanity. Your party has risen up in arms, leading the entire nation, charging forward with flesh and blood, to resist Japanese imperialism. Advancing wave after wave, without the slightest discouragement, this spirit of independent struggle is truly enough to seize the souls of the Japanese and shows that oppressed peoples will eventually be liberated. Our party has always advocated uniting the world's small and weak nations to struggle together. China and Korea are both oppressed nations in the East, with a great need to support each other. Therefore, we have unlimited sympathy for your country's revolutionary actions. We deeply hope that your party will continue to work hard, implement its principles, and complete the glorious mission of independence. Our association will lead all comrades and people in the province to provide support to your country, restrain the strong and stubborn, and promote humanity. However, there is one thing we dare to tell your party: Communist Party members are accustomed to using their cunning tricks in anti-imperialist movements, seducing revolutionary comrades to sacrifice themselves and gain their own benefits. In the past, our party nearly lost the great cause of the revolution because it failed to detect their conspiracies early. Even now, speaking of it still makes us shudder. As your country's revolution flourishes, we dare to offer our past experiences as a lesson from the past. We hope you will be vigilant to avoid being misled by traitors. This will not only be fortunate for the future of your country's revolution, but also for the future of the world revolution. We hereby send this telegram to express our sincerity. We hope you will take note. Respectfully, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<h3>Wuhu City to Levy Wharfage Dues</h3>
<p>Eight Percent of Import and Export Taxes to be Collected</p>
<p>To Fund Riverside Road and Other Construction</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu's plan to build a riverside road began more than twenty years ago. At that time, the Customs Office levied a wharfage due as a supplementary tax, specifically for construction funds. The accumulated dues reached several hundred thousand yuan, but the project was suspended midway due to the situation at the time, and the wharfage due was also discontinued. Now, the Anhui Provincial Government believes that the situation has stabilized and construction is starting. Wuhu City is extremely important in terms of the Yangtze River and Anhui Province, and the construction of the riverside road cannot be delayed any longer. After deliberation, the provincial government decided to instruct the Construction Department to make proper preparations and ordered the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office to start levying wharfage dues in advance, with the special funds stored for construction preparation. If there are surplus dues, other construction matters will be carried out. The tariff rate is set at eight percent of the import and export taxes of the Maritime Customs and Native Customs. However, domestic rice, grains, beans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains related to people's food, as well as domestic practical goods and handicrafts, will receive a 50% refund of the tariff to show maintenance and encouragement. The Municipal Office will set up a separate agency to be responsible for collection. The office has already notified the Chamber of Commerce of the tariff regulations and instructed all businesses to comply. Collection will begin as soon as the collection agency is established.

<h3>Fan Xiji Returns to Jinan from Beijing</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Fan Xiji, commander of the 26th Army and concurrently commander of the 46th Division, recently went to Beijing by special train on behalf of Chen Tiaoyuan to report to Chairman Chiang on the defense and political situation of Shandong. Chiang was very satisfied with the military and political situation and stated that after Liu Zhi's Second Route Army was stationed in Xuzhou, the southern defense of Shandong would require a different arrangement and gave Fan many instructions. Fan believed that the defense of Shandong was important and returned to Jinan from Beijing by special train at 3:00 PM on the 7th. There were many troop trains along the way, and the train traveled very slowly. The train passed Lincheng at 4:30 PM on the 8th and arrived in Yanzhou, where he was joined by Ruan Zhaochang, commander of the 55th Division stationed in Yanzhou, to come to Jinan by the same train to discuss the province's defense. The train departed from Yanzhou at 8:10 PM and arrived in Jinan at 2:00 AM this morning (the 9th). Those who welcomed him at the station included Bai Yushan, Deputy Adjutant-General of the General Headquarters, Li Songshan, Commander of the 164th Brigade of the 55th Division, Wang Leshan, Deputy Brigade Commander, and important officials of the 26th Army Headquarters. After getting off the train, Fan and Ruan took a car to the Provincial Government to report everything to Chen Tiaoyuan. It is rumored that Yue Shengxuan's troop of the 163rd Brigade of the 55th Division will be transferred to Caozhou. The General Headquarters will hold a meeting today to make a decision.

<h3>Homicide for Property Occurs in Xiangtan</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was the Concubine of a Regiment Commander</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, February 9th: At dawn on February 7th, a tragic case of homicide for property was discovered in a latrine on the side of Xihu Bridge Road outside the South Gate of Xiangtan, causing a stir throughout the city. The deceased was a woman, only seventeen years old, named Yang Shuqiu, the third concubine of Zhong Guangren, the commander of the third regiment of the 56th Brigade of the 19th Division. They had been married for just over a year, and she was already pregnant and about to give birth. At 6:00 PM on the 6th, she and her niece, Zhong Qingying, went to see a movie at the Far East Theater in Huangdianping. The show ended at 10:00 PM, and it was raining and snowing. There were few rickshaws. The Zhong family lived at No. 44 Wujiaping outside the South Gate. At this time, there was only one rickshaw at the theater entrance. The niece, because her aunt was pregnant, let her take it first and then hired a rickshaw to follow her home. Unexpectedly, when the niece arrived home, her aunt had not yet returned. Until the morning of the 7th, there was still no sign of her. The family noticed that Yang had a pair of gold bracelets, weighing three taels and one mace, a gold necklace, weighing two taels, and a gold ring, worth a total of three to four hundred yuan. Since she had gone and not returned, they knew something was wrong and reported it to the Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation. While the Public Security Bureau was investigating, the 4th Police Precinct of the South Sub-bureau reported that a female corpse had been found in a latrine on the side of Xihu Bridge Road on the morning of the 7th, wearing a blue Chinese broadcloth yellow fox fur cheongsam, a blue iron satin cloak, dark red silk cotton trousers, green wool socks, and white silk stockings, with a gold ring on her hand, a gold tooth in her mouth, and wounds on her face and right hand, and that she appeared to be about eighteen or nineteen years old. They immediately notified the Zhong residence to send Zhong Gang, the regiment commander's brother, to verify the body. It was confirmed to be Yang Shuqiu, the third concubine. Only the gold ring on her body remained, and the rest had been lost. The police station immediately telegraphed the Changsha District Court to send personnel to the scene for inspection. It was confirmed that she had been suffocated to death with cloth stuffed in her mouth and nose and then moved to the latrine. The Zhong residence believed that the rickshaw puller had been tempted by money late at night, committed homicide for property, and requested the military and police to rigorously pursue and arrest the culprit. Zhang Zhu, the director of the Changsha Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Wei Suzhong, the commander of the Changsha Garrison, felt responsible for this tragic case in the provincial capital and requested punishment. In addition to requesting punishment, they also dispatched military police at 10:00 AM on the 7th to surround the residents within a three or four li radius of the scene of the incident, Xihu Bridge and Xiuwen Street, cut off traffic, and conduct a house-to-house search until 4:00 PM, but found no suspicious signs. According to nearby residents, there was no cry for help or startling sound that night, so the body must have been moved from another place. The residents in the South Gate area were greatly disturbed that day. Although military and police agencies sent out scouts, they still had no clues. The corpse was temporarily claimed by the Zhong family for funeral arrangements. At 1:00 PM on the 8th, Regiment Commander Guangren of the Zhong family received the news from Hengzhou, rushed to the provincial capital, and wept over the body. In addition to separately requesting the military and police authorities to quickly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice, he also paid a visit to He Jian to report everything. He Jian issued a handwritten order to the military and police authorities to solve the case within five days. Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau and Commander Wei of the Garrison then dispatched military police on the 8th to conduct a second house-to-house search outside the South Gate, dividing them into eleven groups for four hours, but found nothing except that Wu Shusheng and Guo Jusheng, two rickshaw pullers lodging at the home of Gong Chunsheng, the head of No. 37 Zongpu Lane, had gone to the countryside the night before, which was suspicious. The head of the household was ordered to chase the two men back to the city for examination. The Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Zhu, believed that the case was related to the rickshaw pullers and ordered the Rickshaw Union to instruct all rickshaw pullers in the city to temporarily suspend operations from the 9th and gather at the Public Security Bureau for examination. As a result, thousands of rickshaw pullers were suspended from work and gathered at the Public Security Bureau for examination. It is unknown whether they can be captured, but the rickshaw pullers are suffering because they have no means of livelihood. According to a report from the Li Wenyu Gold Store in Xiangtan, a person wearing a boater hat and short clothes came to the store early on the 7th with a gold necklace and exchanged it for more than 120 yuan. The weight was the same as the one worn by the third concubine. The Public Security Bureau was notified and informed the Zhong residence to come and identify it. It turned out to be the third concubine's item. Unfortunately, the criminal could not be tracked down. The military and police agencies have been busy with this case for days and have offered a reward of 500 yuan for the arrest.</p>
<h3>Fujian First Division Suppresses Fuzi Society Bandits</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In southern Fujian, in the Zhangzhou area, banditry is secretly growing. In addition to the Triad Society-style bandits, there are also Fuzi Society bandits, similar to the Boxers, who use divine power and spells to fool the people. They are most prevalent in the Longxi, Nanjing, and Pinghe areas. These bandits not only use supernatural Taoist charms to deceive people, but also fool the people by supporting a monarch. Their actions are the same as bandits, robbing and kidnapping. The garrison troops are suppressing them severely. On the 2nd of this month, Yang Fengnian, the second brigade commander of the provisional First Division in Zhangzhou, sent Captain Chen Kun of the Special Affairs Company to lead troops to search and suppress bandits outside the South Gate. The bandits fled upon hearing the news and were found hiding in the nearby mountains. At dawn on the 3rd, they divided into three routes to encircle and suppress them. They killed more than a dozen bandits and wounded more than twenty. They captured two bandit sentries alive and beheaded them on the spot as a warning to the public. They seized two Mauser rifles and then broke into the bandit's lair, rescuing five kidnapped civilians, including Li Fengyan, Shui Jiao, Yan Jianfang, Yan Jianfu, and Yan Apin. On the 4th, they captured another bandit. According to his confession, the bandit commander's surname was Chen, his name was Yueli, and when the bandits fought, they wore a charm on the left side of their chest, which would prevent them from being injured by gunfire within five steps, but its effectiveness only lasted for two hours.</p>
<h3>Jilin Province Implements Self-Government</h3>
<p>To be Implemented in Three Stages</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Zhang Zuoxiang, the chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, in order to promote full civic participation, has ordered Zhang Qihuai, the Director of Civil Affairs, to formulate procedures for the implementation of self-government in all counties, districts, and townships in Jilin Province. The draft has been completed and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. The bill stipulates that the people will be guided in stages to implement self-government, based on the distance of the counties and districts, and in the order of priority. The content is quite complete and is transcribed as follows: (1) Jilin Province is located in a remote corner, and the conditions in each county are different. Therefore, it is difficult to carry out self-government matters at the same time. Now, in accordance with the law and after careful consideration of the current situation, it is divided into the following three stages to determine the implementation procedures for each county: Stage 1: 22 counties: Yongji (formerly Jilin), Changchun, Shuangcheng, Fuyu, Tingji, Ning'an, Binjiang, Yanshou, Panshi, Dehui, Bin County, Yushu, Hunchun, Yilan, Yitong, Nong'an, Wuchang, Shuangyang, Shulan, Acheng, Helong, and Wangqing. (Explanation) The above 22 counties, such as Yongchang, Shuangfu, Yanning, Binyan, Pandebin, and Yuhunyi, are all first and second-class counties. Although Yinongwu, Shuangshu, and Acheng are third-class, they are relatively wealthy. As for Helong and Wangqing, due to special circumstances, they are uniformly listed in the first stage. Stage 2: 12 counties: Fangzheng, Huadian, Changling, Muling, Huachuan, Weihe, Zhuhe, Dunhua, Emu, Boli, Baoqing, and Mengjiang. Stage 3: 8 counties: Dongning, Mishan, Fuyuan, Fujin, Tongjiang, Raohe, Hulin, and Qian'an. (Explanation) Although the above counties are all third-class, because they are located in remote areas, sparsely populated, and suffered from Russian military trampling last year, it is difficult to restore their original state at once.</p>
<p>It is difficult to simultaneously handle the above with counties such as Fangzheng, so they are listed in the third stage. (2) The implementation dates of the aforementioned three stages are as follows: Stage 1: Starts on January 1, 19th year of the Republic of China; Stage 2: Starts on March 1, 19th year of the Republic of China; Stage 3: Starts on September 1, 19th year of the Republic of China. (3) The matters to be handled and the time periods for each stage are as follows: A. The county government delineates each autonomous region and compiles each autonomous township and town, for two months. B. The district chief delineates the township and town areas and organizes the district office for two months. C. The district chief convenes township and town meetings separately to elect the township head, deputy township head, town head, deputy town head, and the township and town supervisory committees, and organizes the township and town offices for two months. D. The township head and town head delineate the neighborhoods and villages, convene neighborhood and village resident meetings separately, and elect the neighborhood chief and village chief for two months. The above matters will be handled sequentially by the county, district, township, and town in stages and prepared in advance. (4) After the organization of the district and township, matters related to district and township self-government will be prepared in accordance with the provisions of the District Self-Government Implementation Law and the Township and Town Self-Government Implementation Law. (5) If any county in the first and second stages cannot be held within the set deadline due to special obstacles, it should explain the reasons in detail and report to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval to extend the period and report to the Provincial Government for record. The above extension shall not exceed two months. (6) If any county in the second and third stages can be handled in advance, it should report to the Department of Civil Affairs for approval and report to the Provincial Government for record. (7) The regulations for self-government matters in each county, district, township, and town should be formulated. When the district chief and township head are appointed, they should be determined by the county government or the Department of Civil Affairs, unless otherwise stipulated by law. (8) These implementation procedures will be abolished when self-government is uniformly held in all counties, districts, townships, and towns throughout the province. (9) These implementation procedures will be implemented from the date of approval by the Provincial Government.</p>

<p>Young Girl Elopes to Demand Dissolution of Engagement: A certain Xu from a town in Qingpu is already over fifty, and his wife, Wu, has no sons under her knees, only a daughter, named Wan'e, who is 29 years old and currently studying at a girls' school in Shanghai. Xu, because he had no sons, recruited a son-in-law from Jiashan, surnamed Fang, last summer, without the consent of his daughter. But Wan'e had a lover when she was studying in Shanghai, and she had informed her father of this in a letter last winter, stating that she absolutely denied such a marriage. Xu ignored her and chose a day before to marry his daughter, decorating the house with lanterns and festoons and appearing quite busy. At this point, Wan'e knew that nothing could be done, so she suddenly took advantage of the opportunity to flee to Shanghai the day before the wedding. It is now heard that</p>
<p>Xu has received a letter from his daughter in Shanghai, demanding the dissolution of this autocratic marriage and the establishment of a free marriage contract. She has vowed not to return home until her goal is achieved.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Refugees Cause Disturbance and Are Mistaken for Bandits: Recently in the four townships within the county, there have been instances of fake refugees causing disturbances everywhere. In the Gaocheng'an area behind Yi Ba Tu outside the North Gate, at the home of the former Tu chief, Gu Guoxiang, on the afternoon of the 10th, at 2 PM, thirty to forty refugees from Funing and other counties forcibly demanded five shi of white rice. Because Gu had already been repeatedly extorted by refugees after the lean years, and had no rice left in his home, he politely refused. The refugees then caused a great disturbance in his home, smashing objects and severely beating Gu and his son, Xi'an, causing injuries. Neighbors who heard of this were indignant and tried to reason with the refugees to no avail. They then sounded the alarm, and the crowd came to Gu's home, arresting seven refugees, including Hu Tinghua and Wang Zhongkang. Gu's family had established a public school and immediately reported the situation to the nearby Provincial Farmers' Education Center. Director Chen Ruizhang reported it by telephone to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, who relayed it to the county government. Meanwhile, patrol chief Hui Zheng was dispatched, leading police to the countryside to suppress the disturbance. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent Zheng Chao, the first squad leader of the Third Company of the Police Brigade, leading special agent Fang Zheng and a squad of police to the countryside. They took Hu Tinghua and the other seven to the county for interrogation. At the time, it was reported in the city that bandits were causing disturbances in the countryside, causing considerable panic for a time. After the seven refugees, Hu Tinghua, etc., were brought to the county, the court interrogated them once that night and ordered that the refugees be deported.</p>
<p>Banning Concurrent Exchange Operations: In Zhuchang Lane outside the North Gate of this county, there are two yarn shops, Li Chang and Long Chang. Although they outwardly display yarn shop signs, their content is actually the receiving and dispatching office of a certain Lu, a broker from the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange. These two yarn shops are very accommodating in their business, so shallow-minded people flock to them. At the end of the year, many end up failing and losing heavily, even unable to make up for the losses, and stop doing business. It is undeniable that people are talking about it. Moreover, exchange brokers should conduct transactions at the exchange and are not allowed to leave the exchange, set up shops in Wuxi, and conduct private transactions. If this is not banned for a long time, it is feared that it will harm commerce significantly. Therefore, Jiang Huanqing, chairman of the Qianye Gonghui (Money Trade Association) Committee, yesterday specifically sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it find a way to ban it in order to maintain commerce. After receiving the letter, the County Chamber of Commerce immediately forwarded it to the two yarn shops, ordering them to quickly stop concurrently operating exchange brokerage business. It is also heard that the Shanghai-Wuxi long-distance telephone is also exclusively used by the two yarn shops, Li Chang and Long Chang, every morning, which shows the extent of their expenses.</p>
<p>Tragic Incident of Bomb Explosion: In front of the Wufeng Silk Factory in Zhoushanbang, this county, a Jiangbei boat was parked. The boat owner, Wang Daoquan, usually made a living as a barrel maker. On the morning of the other day, he was walking home from the street when he saw a round iron cylinder in an abandoned grave. Wang thought that it contained gold and could be melted down to obtain unexpected wealth. He immediately returned to the boat and placed the iron cylinder in a pot to melt it. Unexpectedly, the iron cylinder caught fire and exploded with a loud noise. Wang Daoquan's face, legs, and other parts were severely injured. Later, a passerby sent Wang to Puren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Two Companies Compete to Open Shuttle Boats: From Anting Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Taicang, the Taixing Company has been operating shuttle boats, and the business is not bad. Recently, the Louqin Company has started to compete with it on the same route. Taixing, considering that it spent a lot of money on rebuilding bridges and dredging waterways along the way when it first started operating, is willing to share the cost and extend the route to Shantou for joint operation. Louqin has not yet agreed. Now, Taixing has filed a complaint with the county government, arguing that Louqin's pier at the station is behind its pier, and passengers must pass through Taixing's pier to disembark, which inevitably infringes on Taixing's sovereignty. County Magistrate Chen has ordered the district office to stop it.</p>

<p>Dispute Over the Division of Funds and Properties Between the City and County: After the delimitation between Suzhou City and Wu County was resolved, the most important task in the first step was to divide the funds and properties between the city and county. Mayor Lu specifically convened local figures on the afternoon of the 10th to hold a meeting for discussion. There were arguments at the meeting, and everyone had their own opinions. However, it seems that most of the so-called local figures did not agree, and those who originally presided over public funds and properties tried their best to avoid the division. However, Mayor Lu expressed his opinion that if the funds and properties of the city and county were not divided, all charitable organizations would never have the hope of reorganization. He insisted on the need for division. As a result, it was decided to convene both city and county parties again to resolve it together. The general local figures are paying close attention to this matter and have been running around and discussing it, which is very active.</p>

The detectives of the Second Squadron of the police detected this and telegraphed Squadron Leader Chen Tianxi. At around 8 PM that evening, Chen led the gun squad soldiers and surrounded Feng Ying's house without a sound. They knocked on the door and entered. Yang Jinxiu opened fire in the house and tried to escape through the door, firing two shots at the police squad in succession. The police squad returned fire, hitting Yang Jinxiu once.

At the beginning of the old lunar year, the villagers, following the usual practice, held a Buddhist festival at Diaoyudun, about two li from the village. On this day, Rukang, along with the village elders, also went to participate. At around 6 PM on the 9th, after dinner, he was going home when he was suddenly stopped by Wu Xigen, who was watching over the Diaoyudun Buddhist festival, along with Wu Xirong, Wu Bingquan, Xia Aliu, and three other people. They blocked his way at Miaohangtou, about one li from Diaoyudun, and killed Rukang with a knife. They also robbed him of all 167 yuan of public funds divided from the Buddhist festival. His leather mandarin jacket, cotton robe, and cotton-padded jacket were also stripped off. They fled and scattered with the stolen goods. Unexpectedly, although Rukang had fainted at the time, he gradually regained consciousness and crawled to the home of Tang Rupei, a hired worker half a li away, and then fainted. Rupei called back Zou You and carried Rukang to his home for urgent treatment. His consciousness gradually cleared, and his mother, Wu Gu, asked him about the situation. He soon died of exhaustion.

<p>Robbing Property but Not Admitting Robbery: Wu Houzai from Xiagang opened a wood shop east of the bridge. At 12 PM on the sixth night of the old lunar year, when the men and women in the house were asleep, six or seven bandits suddenly broke into the house, searched extensively, and plundered away, losing 120 yuan in cash.

He did not admit to the robbery. On the 10th, he was sent to the General Bureau.

<p>Bandits Pretend to Enlist Laborers to Carry People: The area around the west side of Xiba Town is relatively remote.

Generally based on the previous meeting methods of Huai'an, Huaiyin, and Lianshui, the long-distance telephone and automobile of the five counties were seriously reorganized. If there is a bandit alarm in the border area between the two counties, they must work together to suppress it. If bandits from County A flee to County B, they can go to suppress them to avoid paperwork. As for the joint defense command, it will be postponed temporarily to save costs.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from Xu Liansheng of Pinghu</h3>
<p>Respectfully, in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, in the local correspondence column on the third page, there was a report that Xu Zhiting of Pinghu was shot and killed by bandits. I was very surprised when I read it. Zhiting is the younger brother of Liansheng, and he runs a rice business. Because the Pingyi Rice Industry Association has a security corps, he has military knowledge for self-defense. Unfortunately, last winter, he and his comrades Wang Jinfu and others went to Shengze Town to visit friends. It happened that the Taihu bandit party was rampant there. He was recruited by Captain Ma of the Jiangsu Water Police to suppress the bandits. Zhiting and Wang Jinfu and others were fearless for a while and died in battle in Hengtang. Now, the aftermath is still being negotiated. As for Zhiting's life, he was a formal businessman and did not sell salt or gamble. His death was actually in battle against the bandits. The report in the newspaper is not consistent with the facts. I would like to 陈情 and ask you to correct it. Xu Zhensheng of Pinghu.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Circular Regarding Points to Note for Church Schools</h3>
<p>Order to Strictly Investigate and Immediately Ban</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 10th), the Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces and special municipalities, ordering them to strictly investigate the points to be noted for church schools established by religious organizations and to report them at any time. The original order is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>It has been ordered that private schools established by religious organizations must not engage in religious propaganda, nor may they make religious subjects compulsory. Now, it is approved to order each (department) [bureau] to strictly investigate the following points for unapproved church schools: 1. Whether Party ideology education is being implemented, and whether all Party ideology teachers and training directors have been certified as qualified; 2. Whether middle and high schools have followed regulations by not making religious subjects compulsory, and whether there are any malpractices such as forcing students to take elective courses; 3. Since elementary schools do not have elective courses, whether there are any situations where children are required to study religious subjects under the guise of electives; 4. Whether there are any instances of students being forced to participate in religious ceremonies outside of class. If any of the above situations are found, they should be immediately banned to emphasize education and protect national character. This is the order.</p>

<h3>Twenty-One Organizations Host Farewell Party for Party Members Studying Abroad</h3>
<p>Chen De-zheng, Cai Yuan-pei, Zhu Shao-ping, Hu Shu-hua, and Others Give Speeches</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau, World's Chinese Students' Federation, Jiaotong University, Central University Business School, Health Construction Committee, Shanghai County Education Bureau, China Science Society, National Jinan University, Qixiu Girls' School, National Tongji University, China Critic Weekly, Medical Review Society, Commercial Press, Sino-French Industrial School, Fudan University, Sino-French Medical School, Zhonghua Book Company, Shen Bao, Shanghai Morning Post, National Labor University, Overseas Chinese Coordination Association, and other twenty-one organizations held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in the Hua'an Building on Jing'an Temple Road to bid farewell to Party members selected by the Central Government to study abroad. Approximately one hundred people attended, including Cai Yuan-pei, President of the Academia Sinica, Leng Jun, Shanghai County Magistrate, Chen De-zheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and representatives from various organizations. First, the Party members studying abroad and the attendees took a group photo as a souvenir. A tea party was then held, with Chen De-zheng, Director of the Education Bureau, presiding. The chairman's speech briefly stated that he, representing the farewell organizations, respectfully extended his best wishes to everyone. The comrades were leaving to study abroad, and great hopes were placed on them, as China was backward in all aspects and had to learn from others to ensure the survival of the nation. The comrades were going far across the ocean to seek advanced studies, which was of great importance to the Party and the nation. However, the value of knowledge depended on the individual. In the world, those who accomplished great things were those with great knowledge, but also those who committed great evils, all of whom possessed great knowledge to achieve their evil. He hoped that the comrades would return with useful knowledge to meet the needs of the country. In the past, those who went abroad to study often could not be used after returning, and even harmed the country, wasting huge sums of money, which was truly heartbreaking. The reason for this was the government's neglect of this matter. Now, the Central Government has selected outstanding young people from across the country, who are knowledgeable and experienced, and will not fail the expectations of the Central Government when they return. Only a few years will pass quickly. When everyone returns in the future, the farewell organizers will surely watch the achievements of the comrades with anticipation, so work hard. Next, Cai Yuan-pei, President of the Academia Sinica, gave a speech, stating that the Party members selected by the Central Government to study abroad had a considerable history of working for the Party. Sending them abroad was to compensate for the losses they had suffered by suspending their studies to work for the revolution. However, the motivation for comrades to pursue advanced studies this time was their own. Therefore, it can be analyzed as follows: 1. Subjectively, to achieve their own goals. 2. To enrich the domestic education level by seeking advanced studies abroad. Therefore, the goal of going abroad is to study, which is also to prepare in advance to serve the Party and the nation. Furthermore, research work is a characteristic of foreign universities. The comrades must first set their own standards for study and engage in advanced research so that they can return with a clear conscience in the future. Following this, speeches were given by Leng Jun, Shanghai County Magistrate, Zhu Shao-ping of the World's Chinese Students' Federation, Hu Shu-hua, President of Tongji University, and Wang Ke-ren, a member of the Management Committee. Magistrate Leng said that China cannot close itself off from the world, and that at a minimum, it must keep pace with other countries in all aspects. Studying abroad is to make up for our shortcomings with the strengths of others. Furthermore, to build a new China, there must be people with the ability to build it. The comrades are going abroad to study with a great responsibility. Zhu Shao-ping described the points to note when studying abroad, that they should be careful with their luggage and travel, and should travel and stay abroad more. Hu Shu-hua briefly said: 1. He hopes that the comrades will do more publicity work abroad so that foreigners can understand the truth about our country. 2. They must seek knowledge in a practical way and not value gaining false fame. Wang Ke-ren briefly said that the issue of studying abroad is worthy of study. Those who went abroad to study in the past were often unaware of the social conditions in their own country, and could not put what they learned into practice after returning. However, this time, the Central Government has selected comrades who are ideologically aligned and will surely benefit the Party and the nation when they return. Finally, Cao Li-ying, the representative of the Party members studying abroad, gave a reply and thanked everyone before the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Also, a total of forty-six Party members were selected to study abroad this time. The previous report omitted Wang Muzun. Wang Muzun is from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from the Central Academy of Sciences and served as a political instructor for the 6th and 10th Armies of the National Revolutionary Army. He now plans to go to the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom to specialize in politics and education. This is especially added here. Furthermore, a discussion meeting will be held at the World's Chinese Students' Federation at No. 95 Carter Road this afternoon at 3 PM.</p>
<h3>Newly Approved Private Schools by the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<p>Four Schools Approved... One School Banned</p>

These include the Shanghai Baptist University Affiliated Middle School, Fudan University Affiliated Middle School, Youmin Elementary School, Xiude Elementary School, and Kindergarten, totaling four schools. Furthermore, the private Pujiang Middle School on Hart Road has no foundation and no responsible school board. Most of the teachers are part-time, which does not comply with the regulations for private schools and is detrimental to young people. It has been ordered to close and liquidate its finances, and to issue certificates to students to facilitate their transfer to other schools.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Talk</h3>
<p>Hoping the Whole Country Rises Up and Unites Against Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>The People on the Border Suffer Ten Times More Losses Than the Government</p>
<p>Dealing with the Russian Situation Based on the Declaration</p>
<p>The Candidates for Representatives Have Not Been Decided Yet</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, returned to Shanghai by night train from Nanjing at 7:00 AM yesterday after completing his mission to the Northeast to comfort the soldiers fighting against Russia. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed him at his residence to inquire about the situation in the Northeast and the various aspects of the war negotiations. Wu's remarks are summarized as follows: Two Lessons Wu said, "I was ordered to go to the Northeast to comfort the soldiers fighting against Russia. After arriving in Liaoning, I originally planned to personally inspect the front lines, but at that time, Manzhouli and Hailar were invaded by Red Russia, and traffic west of Ang'angxi was cut off. I had no choice but to limit my trip to Qiqihar. I originally planned to visit the Xing'an Mountains, but I was unable to do so, which is a great regret." Wu also said, "Although we painfully conceded in this incident with Russia, we can learn two lessons: 1. Dealing with foreign affairs is not a local matter. The whole country should rise up and unite to resist foreign aggression. 2. From the Northeast to the Northwest, the border defense spans thousands of miles and has no defense. With the outer fences removed, we can only allow foreign invaders to slaughter us. We must find a way to remedy this situation as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Northeast Incident Regarding the aftermath of the military situation in the Northeast, Wu said, "The Northeast authorities are now determined to find a way to recall the border guards and thoroughly replenish and reorganize them. As for the losses, the people on the border suffered ten times more than the government. The Northeast authorities are investigating and providing relief. The industry and commerce of the Northeast are still in their infancy, and the merchants and people on the border have a more rudimentary foundation. It is most heartbreaking that they have suffered such violence."</p>
<p>Negotiations with Russia Wu then said, "The records of the preliminary meeting in Boli contain many items that exceed the scope of the instructions from the National Government, such as the restoration of diplomatic relations and trade between the two countries. These issues should be discussed in another meeting. Therefore, the negotiations with Russia will be conducted entirely based on the declaration issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 8th. The official meeting will focus on discussing the aftermath of the China Eastern Railway issue and will not cover other matters. As for the candidates for representatives to the official meeting, they are currently being carefully considered."</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session The Third Plenary Session is scheduled to be held on March 1st and is currently being actively prepared. Chairman Chiang's trip to Guangdong has been cancelled. It is not easy to determine whether he will be able to travel after the Third Plenary Session. He will rest in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Polish and Czech Representatives Jointly Go to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>New Treaties between the Two Countries Are Imminent</p>
<p>The Polish representative, Wei Dengtao, has been in repeated negotiations with the Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issue of adding additional annexes to the new Sino-Polish treaty. Significant progress has been made. Last night at 11:00 PM, Wei, accompanied by a counselor, went to Nanjing to make final contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After drafting the annexes, they will be mailed to Warsaw for instructions before the official signing. In addition, the Czech representative, Ni Cidu, also took a train to Nanjing last night at 11:00 PM to continue discussing the Sino-Czech commercial treaty. It is reported that after the instructions from his country arrive, it can be officially signed within days.</p>
<h3>New Norwegian Envoy Departs for China</h3>
<p>Arrives in Shanghai on the 21st of This Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Affairs Department received a telegram from the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which said that it had received a telegram from the Norwegian Embassy stating that the new Norwegian envoy to China,奥勃脱, had departed on the奥斯脱拉 ship and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st of this month. The Ministry requests advance notification to the Jianghai Customs so that they may be released without inspection, and also requests that personnel be dispatched to the port to receive them at that time, and to inquire about the date of the envoy's trip to Nanjing to present his credentials.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Must Return to Fujian in Two or Three Days</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuejun Will Go with Yang</p>
<p>A Concrete Solution to the Fujian Issue Has Been Found</p>
<p>After Yang Shuzhuang, Minister of the Navy and Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 10th, naval sources in this city reported yesterday that after Yang met with Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, he had a concrete solution to the Fujian issue and the release of the provincial committee. The first step is to send Zhang Yuejun to investigate, and then determine the punishment based on the circumstances. If anyone disobeys orders, they will be dealt with by proper means. As for reducing the naval reorganization office, it is said that only minor mergers will be made to the various departments. The plan is currently under consideration and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. Yang originally planned to return to Fujian with Zhang Yuejun and Yang's chief secretary, Shen Jinmian, yesterday (the 11th), but as there were still several matters to be resolved, it was decided to postpone the trip for two or three days and take the Pu'an transport ship.</p>
<h3>National General Chamber of Commerce Received Telegram from Ministry Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the Matter of Gold Price Hikes and Silver Price Declines</p>
<p>The National General Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Shanghai Republic of China National General Chamber of Commerce, your telegram has been reviewed. It is noted that the recent surge in gold prices and decline in silver prices have suddenly created a tense situation in the financial market. The Ministry considers this to be of utmost importance to the future of our national economy. Previously, a telegram was sent to the Ministry's office in Shanghai, instructing them to convene a meeting with the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce to discuss relief measures, in order to gather diverse opinions. Furthermore, we received instructions from the government to consult with the Ministry of Finance. The proceedings of the meeting have been reported to the National Government for review. The consensus among the nation regarding relief measures for this financial crisis is to adopt the gold standard. However, encouraging production, reforming the monetary system, abolishing excessive taxes, facilitating transportation, and promoting domestic goods are all pressing priorities. The Ministry is currently drafting separate plans to be submitted for approval and implementation. The Chamber's telegram is insightful and pertinent, and its emphasis on restoring social and economic order and protecting public and private property is particularly profound and valuable for reference. You are instructed to continue monitoring the financial market situation at all times and report your findings for review. This is a special reply, Geng Yin (signature of) the Ministry of Industry."</p>
<h3>Municipal Propaganda Department Expands Promotional Campaign for Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>The campaign to promote domestic goods was originally decided by the Central Government as one of the seven major movements during the period of political tutelage for lower-level party branches. The Municipal Propaganda Department of this city held a large-scale domestic goods movement rally last year in conjunction with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which proved to be quite effective. Recently, the trend of expensive gold and cheap silver has erupted, which has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. The department urgently ordered party branches at all levels to immediately engage in lectures and discussions, and instructed all party members to conduct practical research in order to remedy the situation. However, based on the current state of the nation, the people's livelihood, and the environment, the most urgent and fundamental solution is believed to be the promotion of domestic goods. On the one hand, this can reduce the losses caused by expensive gold and cheap silver, and on the other hand, it can revitalize industries, recover interests, and build the foundation of the national economy. Therefore, the department is sparing no effort in planning this movement. It is reported that they have already produced a promotional plan for the domestic goods movement, measures for holding lectures on the domestic goods movement, an outline of lecture materials for the domestic goods movement, and a brief overview of the impact of expensive gold and cheap silver. These four documents have been distributed to party branches at all levels and various public organizations to be followed for publicity purposes. In addition, a thick volume on the expensive gold and cheap silver crisis is currently being printed. This book contains a wealth of information and is a unique reference for studying this issue. It is expected to be published soon. It is reported that the department will set a date to convene a large-scale propaganda conference to expand the publicity. The aforementioned measures and outlines are summarized below:</p>
<p>Promotional Plan for the Domestic Goods Movement: ㈠ Regularly convene a propaganda conference for the domestic goods movement; ㈡ Party branches at all levels hold lectures on domestic goods; ㈢ Various public organizations hold lectures on domestic goods; ㈣ Organize lecture teams to promote domestic goods in various entertainment venues and factories (collect volunteers during district propaganda meetings, based on the principle of district allocation); ㈤ Invite experts to give lectures; ㈥ Formulate measures and reporting forms for party branches at all levels and public organizations to hold lectures on domestic goods, as well as lecture materials; ㈦ Write a report on the impact of expensive gold and cheap silver; ㈧ Request the Social Affairs Bureau to establish a domestic goods exhibition hall; ㈨ Request the Executive Committee to forward a request to the Central Government to issue a nationwide order that all party members and civil servants are prohibited from using foreign goods; ㈩ Request the Education Bureau to create permanent promotional lead skin slogans advocating the use of domestic goods and prohibiting the use of foreign goods.

<p>Investigation Outline of the Impact of Expensive Gold and Cheap Silver:　Since our country implemented tariff autonomy and the call to abolish consular jurisdiction, it shocked the economic invading powers. Therefore, the imperialists, in panic, contacted each other and started from London and New York. With banks in China as tools, they tried their best to raise the price of gold, hoping to deprive our country of the ability of tariff autonomy, so that the economy would never be independent and they could cut and slaughter us. We know that this is indeed the final struggle of the great powers, and relying on our revolutionary diplomacy with the people of the whole country as our backing, we will eventually achieve our goal. However, the impact of this crisis has a great impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is really worth our understanding. The impact on finance is listed as follows: Expensive gold and cheap silver will lead to high water rates. High water rates will lead to increased pound losses. My country should pay a huge amount of compensation to foreign countries every year. According to the report of the General Tax Department, in the eighteenth year, 65,236,134.134 taels of standard silver were paid in principal and interest from tariffs, which was 7,947,388.54 taels more than the 57,388,724.87 taels in the seventeenth year. This is because the loss of pound loss due to the decline in money prices. Roughly every shilling shrinks by one penny, then China should pay 800,000 taels more in foreign debt, so if this continues, even if the tariff revenue is not reduced, the surplus due to the increase in the silver value of foreign debt will also become a problem. The surplus is the mortgage for domestic debt. If domestic and foreign debts lose their guarantee, the national finances will go bankrupt. The impact on the national economy is that, in terms of international trade, our country is a country that needs silver. The prices of all import and export goods often increase or decrease according to the exchange rate. Merchants are accustomed to valuing goods in gold coins when ordering, and the settlement is unclear. When the goods arrive in Shanghai, they are paid in silver. If the price of silver rises during this period, profits can be made. However, if the price of gold is high and the price of silver is cheap, the burden on merchants will be heavy, and they will lose their ability to settle and go bankrupt frequently. It is reported that the item of piece goods has not yet been settled at present, and the goods imported in February and March of last year have a huge amount of more than 20 million, and it seems that there has been no small loss in the recent situation. The price of gold is expensive, and the cost of imported finished goods or raw materials will also rise accordingly, so the goods in the domestic market will all rise in price. Rising prices will weaken the purchasing power of the people, and social life will immediately present a difficult phenomenon, and national wealth will be invisibly depleted. However, on the other hand, there is no small benefit for export merchants to drop the price of silver. The price of foreign goods is higher than that of domestic goods, and this can give us an opportunity to promote domestic goods. In fact, only by promoting domestic goods to balance imports and exports, and then achieve the goal of surplus can we save this current crisis, so I deeply hope that comrades and compatriots will unanimously advocate taking the lead in promoting domestic goods and working together to save the country.

<h3>Wu Mai Promotes the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Will Give Speeches in Various Parts of the Concession</p>
<p>The Public Concession Has Been Notified Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Mai, representative of the National Lawyers Association, wrote to the Public Concession, stating: "Respectfully, the system of consular jurisdiction is incompatible with the modern century, a fact that no one can deny. This system is not only an obstacle to Sino-foreign peace, but also hinders economic development, causing disadvantages to both parties, not only to our country. I, Mai, was dispatched by the National Lawyers Association to various provinces to promote the abolition of consular jurisdiction and exchange opinions with consuls of various countries on this matter. When I talked with Kiyoshi Kono, the Japanese consul in Jiujiang, Shirao Shibataki, the Japanese consul in Wuhu, Hugh Liddell, the British consul in Nanjing, and Oton Si, the American consul, they all expressed goodwill and attached great importance to it. It shows that China and foreign countries have sympathy. This time I came to Shanghai to promote the abolition of consular jurisdiction. In addition to giving speeches at the Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Shanghai Local Court, various schools, and public places, I plan to go to various entertainment public places in the concession in the near future to give speeches, in order to arouse the attention of the Chinese people and the understanding of various countries, and not to advocate xenophobia. This kind of orderly, systematic, rational and solemn propaganda should be free from criticism in accordance with the public example of freedom of speech. The speech time is at most a quarter of an hour, there is only one person, and each place is limited to once. In order to avoid misunderstandings, I hereby send a special letter to inform you, and please trouble your bureau to check and protect it. Sincere friendship and hope to reply, this to the Public Concession."</p>

<h3>Crisis of China's Tung Oil Industry</h3>
<p>Britain Plans to Actively Try to Plant Tung Trees</p>
<p>London, 10th (Associated Press) - Since the invention of navigation, the tung oil industry has become increasingly important. Aircraft fuselages coated with tung oil will not be penetrated by moisture no matter how humid the climate is. Moisture is most taboo for aviation because it makes the machine heavier and is prone to rust. The world's supply of tung oil has always depended on China, but because China's sources are multiple provinces and have no fixed quantity, and orders often cannot be delivered on time, the world's tung oil market has felt the difficulty of supply falling short of demand. Since the European War, the United States has sought ways to produce tung trees in its own country, but the scope is too small. In view of this, Britain is now planning to actively try to plant tung trees to extract oil, with the intention of seizing this thriving new industry. The Kew Royal Botanic Gardens in Surrey, England, has been granted a special permit from the Bureau of Commerce, receiving a loan of US$3,500 to collect tung tree seeds and select land for planting. Such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Burma, Ceylon, Essex, West Indies, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Palestine, etc., all of which are supplied with seeds by the botanical garden to carry out extensive trials, which are promising. In addition, the British Bureau of Commerce also plans to allocate a special fund of 3,750 yuan every year to the Paint Research Association to specialize in investigating places suitable for planting tung trees in the UK, testing planting, and the most economical method of extracting oil from oil seeds, and also on how to turn the oil residue into cake blocks for cattle and sheep feed.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Revoked the Boat Donation Contractor</h3>
<p>The boat donation in this city has always been contracted by merchants.

The results have been acceptable for three months. It is now learned that the contract for Chen Jin Rong to contract the boat donation in the urban area has expired at the end of January this year. The Finance Bureau has submitted it to the municipal government for approval and cancellation. In the future, the boat donation will be completely handled by the government itself. The Finance Bureau has appointed responsible personnel to plan and rectify. It is expected that the collection of boat donation can avoid various disputes in the future.</p>

<h3>The Land Bureau Handled the Oil Pond in Gaoqiao District</h3>
<p>Land Bureau Director Zhu Yan reported to the Municipal Government, saying: "Report on the Da Hua Xingye Company purchasing land in Gaoqiao District from Yuxing Company and leasing it to the foreign merchant Asia Petroleum Company to build an oil pond. The bureau handled the collection of fees, and the situation of clearing and measuring is as follows, begging for your review and record. I am investigating the Da Hua Xingye Co., Ltd., which bought the land located in Gaoqiao District, Twenty-seventh Map, from Yuxing Company. On January 17, the Ministry of Finance Su Zi No. 27618, No. 27619, and No. 27620, with a total of 565 mu in the original amount, signed a contract in June 18. The Da Hua Company paid taxes to the Bureau on September 26, and paid 6 yuan of regular tax for every 100 yuan according to the contract price of 226,000 yuan, a total of 13,560 yuan, and 1 yuan of special construction donation, a total of 2,260 yuan. The handling fee was 271 yuan and 2 jiao, and the transfer fee was 300 yuan. The Bureau sent personnel to measure the land to be 529 mu, 1 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao. In addition to ordering the payment of 566 yuan for the measurement fee, since the land in the Ministry's license was only 167 mu, 1 fen, and 5 li, food had already been undertaken, and the rest had not yet been raised. The land that has not been raised should pay the land price and change the certificate and raise the food in accordance with the method of converting the land business license of the Ministry of Finance. According to the land contract price, each mu is 400 yuan, and 40% is paid. After deducting the 10 yuan per mu already paid as recorded in the Ministry's license, it is 49 mu, and each mu is 60 yuan, for a total of 313 mu. The company should pay an additional 38,650 yuan, which has also been ordered to pay in full in accordance with the regulations. This is the situation of the Bureau handling the sale, purchase, contract signing, clearing, measuring mu, collecting taxes and supplementary taxes, and paying the land price. Furthermore, this land was leased by the Chinese merchant Yuxing Company to the British merchant Asia Petroleum Company on January 23, 18 to build an oil pond. The lease was submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Minerals for approval, and was approved and recorded by the Asia Company on October 31, 18, ordering the Bureau to be informed. On the same day, the Asia Company and the Da Hua Xingye Co., Ltd. signed a lease transfer agreement, and submitted it to the Bureau for record. The Special City, the method of dividing the oil pond area, which was announced by the Bureau together with the Works Bureau, was on November 9, 18, so the special construction donation was not collected from the Asia Company in accordance with the method. This is the situation of the Asia Company renting the land and the Bureau not collecting the special construction donation in accordance with the newly established method. The above situation is compiled into a document for reporting, begging for your review and record. Sincerely submitted, "</p>

<h3>Handling of Booth Locations in the City</h3>
<p>Special Municipality Five-Bureau Joint Inspection Passed</p>
<p>Municipal Government Order Stipulating Measures Announced</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Qun, previously, due to the placement of stalls and vendors along roads and sidewalks in various streets and alleys of the city obstructing traffic, ordered a joint inspection by various bureaus. After the completion of the joint inspection by the Public Safety, Social Affairs, Finance, Public Works, and Health Bureaus, the Finance Bureau submitted a report to the Municipal Government, stating that it was a joint report matter. The Public Safety Bureau previously, due to the placement of stalls and vendors along roads and sidewalks in various streets and alleys of the city obstructing traffic, although repeatedly instructed the relevant district offices to strictly prohibit such activities, lacked corresponding measures. The donation permits held by the vendors only specified "a certain street" or "a certain road," without defining specific locations for setting up stalls, resulting in an increasing number of vendors crowding prosperous streets, arbitrarily arranging their goods, and causing disorder. Punishment in the morning was ineffective by evening, and strict prohibition and rectification were difficult to implement. Each district director was instructed to list the locations within their respective jurisdictions where stalls could be set up and where such activities should be prohibited, in order to formulate stall-setting measures. However, as this matter fell under the jurisdiction of various bureaus, a letter was sent to the Finance, Public Works, Social Affairs, and Health Bureaus, requesting them to send personnel to the Public Safety Bureau to hold the first meeting on prohibiting vendors from setting up stalls. A consensus was reached on the implementation plan, starting with the inspection of the area under the jurisdiction of the No. 1 District Office in Hu-Nan, followed by other district offices. During the inspection, the director of the relevant district office was responsible for guiding and first preparing a detailed list of the names and numbers of existing vendors within the area, in order to clearly identify locations and designate stall spaces. The locations for vendors to set up stalls were determined by drawing lots. After the resolution was passed, the Public Safety Bureau instructed the relevant district offices to comply, and at the same time, personnel from the Public Safety Bureau and the Finance Bureau were dispatched to inspect the areas under the jurisdiction of the First District and the Second Office in accordance with the plan. The inspection and determination of stall locations in various district offices and the handling of related matters are detailed below: (1) The inspection revealed that the streets inside and outside the Shiliupu area of the First District's jurisdiction were bustling with commercial activity, and the traffic of vehicles and pedestrians was often congested. The setting up of stalls and vendors had been prohibited by order. Although there were no longer any stalls in Shiliupu, the farmers now depended on the Farmers' Association of the First District for guidance. Now, with the New West District donation dispute pending for more than a year without resolution, and the South District righteousness in the south of Gaochang Temple not unified before the cleaning donation, Mo Baoquan also won the bid to undertake the project, but the farmers came out to obstruct it, and it could not be started and was interrupted. Therefore, it was not included in the unified donation. Now Longhua Town is even further south, and it is clearly impossible to organize before the New West District and the South District. It is obvious that the cleanliness of each place has long been manipulated and controlled by the Farmers' Association. Only by removing the knot can the problem be solved easily. If the two sides continue to hold on to each other, it will not be the end of the matter. Only by still asking for ways to strictly order the Farmers' Association to pay the New West District donation can we start from the South District and gradually move south to achieve unified results. Otherwise, it is impossible for merchants to bear the responsibility, which will only cause disputes and will not benefit the donation. It is reasonable to report the investigation and planning situation truthfully, and hope that the above information will be verified and forwarded. Based on this, the inspection and verification of the above-mentioned items are still the actual situation. It was also found that the case of the Farmers' Association of the First District refusing to pay the cleaning donation has been resolved after repeated meetings with the relevant bureaus by the bureau. The Gaochang District cleaning donation will be carried out according to the plan. In addition to waiting for the two cases to be completely concluded, the Longhua Town cleaning donation will be planned and organized and reported separately. The reason for the previous order is that it is reasonable to report first. I hope that the mayor will approve the report and then issue an order to the five bureaus: "The joint report and charts are all known. The temporary floating areas of the First District and the First District and Second Office, and the location of the small vegetable market, have been inspected and stipulated, and the handling has been standardized, and should be approved for record. The remaining district offices should expedite the implementation as soon as possible to achieve results as soon as possible. However, the location designated by each stallholder, if a stallholder closes down in the future due to various reasons, whether the site should be freely transferred to others, or should be reported to the relevant district offices when the stallholder closes down, and another new stallholder should be recruited, has not been stipulated. Future disputes are inevitable. You should take advantage of the initial handling of this matter, stipulate the measures uniformly, and announce them for implementation, so that there is a basis for compliance and to avoid disputes." This order.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Sino-American Shipping Trend</h3>
<p>Since the competition for silk cargo rates across the Pacific Ocean led to a reduction of one dollar per hundred pounds, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha yesterday implemented the export of its Wales Maru, carrying 450 bales of silk bound for San Francisco and then transferred by rail to New York. Adding the railway transfer fee of nine dollars per bale, the total land and sea freight from Shanghai to New York for every hundred pounds of silk amounted to ten US dollars, reaching its destination in 23 days. After the rate reductions by major firms in this port such as Da Lai and Chang Xing, shipping via Seattle and Vancouver to the United States requires only 19 days to reach New York. However, this issue has caused great panic in the Sino-American shipping industry. There are more than ten shipping companies with New York lines owned by British, American, and Japanese merchants in Shanghai. Due to the competition for cargo from the Far East, each company built new ships last year. Since the disruption of silk cargo rates by Japanese merchants this time, each company also held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The fastest ships from Shanghai to New York take 36-37 days, which is two weeks longer than the Pacific route, but they can avoid the land transport fee. Considering the interest involved in the speed of cargo transport, the New York line ships held an alliance meeting and decided to reduce the fee for each bale of silk from Shanghai to New York by four US dollars (which is six dollars cheaper than the Pacific route with train freight). It was also decided to implement this from today to compete with the Pacific mail ships. This has further expanded the Sino-American shipping trend.</p>
<h3>Navigation News from Beiyang</h3>
<p>Last year, during the winter, the water in the Baihe River in Tianjin was shallow and frozen. Shanghai shipping companies could only transport goods to Tianjin to Dagu Port and then transfer them by barge. Therefore, a barge fee of five cents per item, such as grain, was charged. For goods such as foreign cloth, an additional barge fee of eight cents and four cents per ton was also charged. Recently, the water in the Baihe River has risen. Yesterday, Tianjin telegraphed that the river water was 18 feet deep and the ice had melted, and goods could enter the port. Therefore, the shipping companies announced that the barge fee would be canceled from today.</p>
<h3>China-Japan Air Service Still Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>No Scheduled Flights Allowed Before the Revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Company of Japan is actively preparing for the China-Japan international air transport planned. All procedures have been prepared and completed. It was originally scheduled to start trial flights on March 1 and officially fly on April 1. On the one hand, Acting Minister Shigetsu Aoi also instructed the Japanese Consul in Beijing, Uemura, to negotiate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nearby to request permission to fly. After repeated negotiations, there was no progress. The day before yesterday, Acting Minister Shigetsu had received formal notification from Foreign Minister Wang, that this scheduled international transport was related to the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty. Therefore, it was difficult to allow it before the Sino-Japanese New Treaty had been revised. It would be discussed together when the New Treaty was revised in the future. As for unofficial test flights, if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved them, they might be implemented. Therefore, the plan to implement scheduled flights has been suspended.</p>
<h3>Date of Re-election of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Proportion of People from Each Country Has Not Been Determined</p>
<p>The qualifications of voters and candidates for the re-election of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession have been completely investigated and completed. The election will be held on March 3 and 4, and the results will be announced. The number of directors from each country in previous years has always been five British, two American, and two Japanese. It is rumored that the number of Chinese directors will be increased this time, so the number of people from each country will also be increased, and the proportion will remain the same. However, Japanese taxpayers insist on changing the proportion to 4:3:2, but the number of people will remain the same. It will be decided at the annual meeting.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Prohibits Overstepping Authority to Interfere in Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously, according to the Social Bureau's request, prohibited any organizations from overstepping their authority to interfere in labor dispute events, in order to prevent disputes, etc. It is heard that the case has been approved by the mayor. In addition to sending separate letters to party and military agencies, a notice was issued to prohibit such interference. The notice stated, "For the matter of issuing a notice, according to the Social Bureau, the Labor Dispute Handling Law stipulates that the mediation agency for labor disputes is the administrative agency. The second article of the implementation rules of this law in this city stipulates that the administrative agency for mediating labor disputes is the bureau. It is obvious that the authority to mediate labor disputes in this city belongs to the bureau. However, party and military agencies at all levels in this city often overstep their authority to interfere in labor disputes. Even the General Labor Union, which has not yet been established, also sent personnel to freely mediate labor disputes, resulting in confusion of authority and even more disputes. If such interference is not prevented early, it is feared that many malpractices will arise, which would be a disaster for both labor and management. It is reasonable to prepare a document and request that you respectfully review and issue a strict notice prohibiting any organizations from overstepping their authority to interfere in labor dispute events, in order to prevent disputes and benefit mediation, which is in the public interest." Based on this, it is natural to approve the claim that the above-mentioned claim is for the purpose of strictly complying with laws and regulations and avoiding confusion of authority and the generation of malpractices. In addition to sending separate letters to party and military agencies for investigation and prevention, a notice must be issued to the effect that, in the event of labor disputes in the city, they must be submitted to the competent authorities for handling in accordance with the law. No organization may overstep its authority to interfere, so as to clarify its authority and comply with laws and regulations. Be sure to publish this.</p>

In addition, the British and American Tobacco Factories Union also issued a declaration yesterday to help the unemployed workers of the Nanyang Factory, requesting all sectors to provide assistance (the original report and declaration are omitted).</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Chinese Hygiene Society</h3>
<p>Adoption of the Charter and Election of Directors</p>
<p>Central Committee member Chu Minyi and Health Minister Liu Ruiheng initiated the organization of the Chinese Hygiene Society. The inaugural meeting was held last night at Xinghualou. Chu Minyi was publicly elected chairman to report on the development of the society. In a short time, 134 people signed up to join the ranks of the founders. The charter was then discussed, and directors were elected. Chu distributed the draft charter he had prepared to the members for public discussion. Wang Wanbai stood up and said that the draft charter was generally sound, but as it was a national society, the number of directors should be increased to fifteen to cover distribution, and proposed that the first directors be nominated by the founders to save time. Yu Fengbin stood up to second. The proposal was put to a vote and unanimously approved. Next, the directors were mutually nominated. Minister Liu Ruiheng announced the list of fifteen directors, including Chu Minyi, Quan Shaoqing, Wang Wanbai, Xiao Zhiji, Zheng Hao, Niu Huisheng, Xu Naili, Pang Jingzhou, Yan Fuqing, Hu Hongji, Wang Qizhang, Cai Yumen, Chen Wanli, Fang Zhao, and Liu Ruiheng.

<h3>Request for the Issuance of Regulations on the Prohibition of the Import of Medical Contraband</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Letter to the Ministry of Health</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau previously stated that the measures for prohibiting the import of medical contraband had not yet been issued, resulting in many inconveniences in handling procedures. It specially submitted a report to the Municipal Government, requesting the Ministry of Health to issue the measures as soon as possible. After receiving the report, the Municipal Government yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Health, stating, "For the matter of requesting a letter, according to the Health Bureau, the imported syringes and injection needles used for medical purposes are originally needed for treating diseases. There are often shameless people who use them for other purposes, which is harmful to society, which is not shallow. All countries have regulations to ban the import of such needles. In Shanghai alone, the number of such needles imported and smuggled in each year is quite large. If they are not strictly restricted, it will not be enough to stop the flow. For example, recently, the German merchant Sin Yi Chemical Pharmaceutical Company imported as many as 800 dozen of such needles. The Public Security Bureau repeatedly sent letters asking whether it could be allowed to extract all of them. The bureau believes that this matter is important and there are no special regulations to rely on. It immediately replied to the bureau that it can only temporarily follow the provisions of Article 5 of the Sino-German Agreement on the Prohibition of Anesthetic Drugs, that if such needles are to be transferred to other places for sale, they should be handled in accordance with that article. If they are not transferred to other ports, but are to be sold in Shanghai, since there is no need for such a large number of needles in Shanghai, only two-tenths can be received, and then two-tenths can be reported after the sales are completed. When reporting for the second time, the names of the people to whom the needles were sold and the signature and seal or signature of the buyers must be sent to the bureau by the company for review and verification before the second batch can be reported to make a temporary transition. There are also foreign merchants and foreign firms who privately order such needles from foreign countries. After arriving at the port, they cannot extract them from the customs, and have to sell them to hospitals or doctors, hoping to have the names and seals of hospitals or doctors so that they can extract them. Unexpectedly, the customs must rely on the bureau's letter to verify before they can extract them, which has caused foreign firms to entrust doctors or hospitals to submit requests for certification. All of this is because the regulations have not been issued, resulting in many inconveniences in handling procedures. In order to make it easy for the public, it is requested that you review and approve the submission to the Ministry of Health, and that the regulations on the prohibition of the import of such needles be formulated and promulgated as soon as possible, so that there is a basis." Based on this, the claims of the bureau are true, and it is appropriate to request your ministry to verify and handle them and reply.</p>

<h3>Criminal Arrest in Zhenru District, Jin Lane: Gamblers Resist Police</h3>
<p>Hooligans Gather Gamblers, Villagers Gather a Crowd of a Hundred People to Stubbornly Resist</p>
<p>Village Chiefs Report, Police Chief Leads Forty Police to Surround and Arrest</p>
<p>Sixteen Gamblers Arrested</p>
<p>Seven Officers and Police Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 3:00 AM, a villager resistance incident occurred in the third jurisdiction of the fourth district of Zhenru Town. When the local police went to Jin Lane to arrest gamblers, they were suddenly confronted by more than one hundred villagers holding weapons such as pistols, Mauser pistols, broadswords, iron and wooden clubs, hoes, and axes. They fired sixty or seventy shots, injuring six officers, including the inspector. Numerous firearms, silver dollars, badges, and uniforms were seized. It was not until dawn that sixteen criminals were captured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Gambling Dens: Zhenru is located eighteen miles northwest of Shanghai. Most of the residents are farmers, and policing is difficult due to the long reach. During the Lunar New Year, local thugs and hooligans often gather crowds to gamble, profiting from skimming, which is extremely harmful. However, their movements are very secretive, and they are well-prepared, making it difficult to arrest them. Therefore, they have become even more unscrupulous recently, with as many as three gambling dens.</p>
<p>Director Yang Reports: Yang Pinzhi, the director of the town, could not bear to stand idly by as the gambling trend intensified. He submitted a report to the police station of the third division of the fourth district at 9:00 PM the night before, requesting that police be sent to apprehend them.</p>
<p>Pursuit and Gathering Crowds: After receiving the report, Director Yang immediately ordered Inspector Cheng Yankun, Sergeant Liu Weibei, and police officers Sang Wanqing and Bai Junqing to proceed to Jin Lane at night with flashlights, badges, and other items to make arrests. While traveling near the Shuixiang Temple, about eight miles from the town, they encountered four villagers. One of them was holding a child and was dressed extravagantly. Inspector Cheng suspected their behavior and ordered them to stop and submit to questioning and inspection. The villagers replied, "We are returning from a wedding feast and do not need to be searched." The inspector, considering their rude remarks, stepped forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, two of them suddenly ran away. This increased their suspicion, and they pursued them on foot. However, due to the darkness, the three disappeared in an instant, and the fourth took out a police whistle and blew it wildly. In no time, villagers gathered upon hearing the sound, creating a clamor of gongs and drums. In a few minutes, the crowd grew larger and larger, reaching about one hundred people, some holding pistols and Mauser pistols, others wielding broadswords, iron and wooden clubs, or carrying hoes, axes, and bamboo poles. They surged forward in a tumultuous manner, shouting, "Charge! Beat them to death!" The sound reached several miles.</p>
<p>Villagers Stubbornly Resist: The police officers, outnumbered, did not resist at all. Inspector Cheng, fearing that the situation would escalate, ordered the police to report back to the director while he climbed to a high place and earnestly advised them, "We are here to arrest gamblers, which is to eliminate harm for the people. You are all law-abiding villagers. Why are you resorting to violence? Anything can be discussed." However, the villagers were unreasonable. Those with guns fired continuously, sounding like strings of beads. After about ten minutes, they ran out of ammunition and resorted to using knives and clubs. At this critical moment, Inspector Cheng ordered the police not to retaliate but to hide in the low-lying areas to avoid danger. However, many were injured as a result.</p>
<p>Armed Arrest: Half an hour later, Director Yang led more than forty police officers, armed with live ammunition, to suppress the situation. The villagers, seeing the situation, knew they were no match and scattered like birds and beasts. The police then bravely surrounded and arrested twelve criminals. However, the injured were numerous, lying on the ground unable to move. The captured criminals were escorted back to the station. However, when they were about two miles from the station, a large group of villagers came from behind, intending to seize them. The director ordered the police to fire several shots into the air to scare them away and then moved forward to apprehend them, capturing four more and bringing them to the station.</p>
<p>Names of Those Arrested: According to the interrogation of those arrested, Ayou is from Jiading, 46 years old, living at Zhuyang Bridge; Qian Yongcai, 28 years old, living at Luoyang Bridge, runs a rice store; Chen Chunsheng, 22 years old, living at Chenjiazhai; Qian Bosheng, living at Luoyang Bridge, 30 years old; Qian Xitang, 48 years old; Qian Laoyu, 29 years old; Qian Quanlin, 22 years old; Qian Jisheng, 31 years old; Qian Fangchu, 32 years old; Qian Amao, 36 years old; Qian Jinping, 54 years old; Qian Jiang, 21 years old, all living at Luoyang Bridge; Feng Atong, 47 years old; Qian Weiquan, 22 years old; Chen Chunwang, 22 years old; Qian Genyuan, 23 years old, all from Jiading.</p>
<p>Police Officers Injured: As for the police officers, Inspector Cheng Yankun suffered a head injury, a fractured left arm, and lost twelve silver dollars, a party certificate, a wallet, and other items. Sergeant Liu Weibei and police officers Sang Wanqing, Bai Junqing, Shi Zaisi, Huang Lisheng, and Wang Futing were all injured in the head, arms, and body. Cheng and Sang suffered the most severe injuries. They were all sent to the Baolong and Jisheng hospitals for treatment. A large number of seized firearms and uniforms were also recovered.</p>
<h3>Japanese Woman Confesses to Killing Japanese Child</h3>
<p>Theft Due to Poverty... Murder Due to Theft</p>
<p>Wenhui News reports that the seventeen-year-old dancer Niye, who brutally murdered the one-month-old daughter of Kajiwara Sadashichi, was arrested last night (the 10th). This morning (the 11th), she confessed to Chief Hanari at the Japanese consulate that she committed the murder due to theft and signed the confession. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, she was taken to Judge Aoki for questioning and temporarily detained. She will be transferred to the Nagasaki District Court for preliminary hearing within a week. According to her confession, she is seventeen years old and came to Shanghai from Dalian on the 28th of last month. She worked as a dancer in a certain bar on North Sichuan Road. However, her income was not sufficient, and her stepfather was unable to assist her. She left after a few days, intending to find another place to live. Last Saturday, she visited a friend on Dixiwei Road but did not find them. On her way back, she saw the gate of No. 807 ajar, and no one was around. She thought to herself that she had no money and was starving, and the landlord was pressing her to pay rent. Now was a good opportunity to sneak in and steal a few items from the hat rack to pawn and use. After entering, she saw that there were only a few men's hats on the rack and nothing of much value. The house was quiet, and she became bolder. She crept upstairs and into a room, where she saw a baby sleeping soundly. She found a set of manicure tools and several pieces of jewelry, such as rings, in a box, as well as several pads. As she was tying them with a ribbon, the baby suddenly woke up and cried. She initially tried to comfort the baby by patting its face and holding its hand to stop the crying, but it was ineffective. She then pressed the pads and other items on its face, but it continued to cry. She then tied its throat with a white cloth, but it was still ineffective. At that moment, there were footsteps downstairs. She was very anxious and killed the baby with the manicure tools. She cannot remember how she did it at the time, but she knew she closed the manicure tools and hurried out of the room, running down the stairs. She remembered encountering Mrs. Kajiwara at the top of the stairs, who asked her what she was doing. She pushed her aside and fled, hiring a rickshaw to return to North Sichuan Road. It is also said that this woman suffered from mental illness.</p>

<h3>Dalun Lease Termination Case Appeal</h3>
<p>Dalun Real Estate Company and Da Zhonghua Department Store Co., Ltd. entered into a lease agreement in the autumn of the year before last, leasing the area of thirty-odd shops owned by the former, stretching from the post office on Nanjing Road to Hibiya, to the latter to build a grand twelve-story department store. It was found that the leases for each shop were indefinite. In early November of the year before last, Dalun had once declared to the shops that it had leased the area to Da Zhonghua Company and notified them to terminate their leases in early September of last year. Because the tenants refused to move out, Dalun filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Provisional Court. In the first instance, on November 20 of last year, a judgment was made ordering the defendants to move out within a specified period. Subsequently, the defendants' representatives, lawyers Zheng Yuxiu and others, declared an appeal. The plaintiff, citing the prolonged delay of the case and significant losses, has entrusted Lian Kui, Shi Ying, Li Zuyu, He Qingyun, and other lawyers to appear in court to argue against the appeal. It is heard that the case is scheduled to be heard by Hu Yigu, the president of the appellate court, on the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Hua Dawei Bigamy Case to Be Pronounced</h3>
<p>Hua Dawei, a native of Changzhou, was sued by his first wife, Yang Yonghua, in the Provisional Court for bigamy. The first hearing was held a few days ago, but the defendant did not appear, while his second wife, Tang Manqi, appeared in court to testify. It was ordered that Hua Dawei be summoned to court for further questioning. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge held a continued hearing, and both parties appeared. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, the plaintiff's accusation is based on the defendant's bigamy, not on the 3,000 taels of gold stipulated in the agreement. Yang Yonghua further stated that her husband and Tang Manqi were married at Xuyuan Park, and her in-laws attended the wedding, but she did not. The agreement was signed at the end of March of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, under duress from Dawei. According to the defendant Hua Dawei, he is now twenty-three years old. He had an old-style wedding with Yang Yonghua in his hometown fifteen years ago. The following year, he came to Shanghai and studied at St. John's University. Through the introduction of a friend, he met Miss Tang and developed a romantic relationship. Later, with the mediation of relatives from both sides, this agreement was established. He then had a new-style wedding with Tang at Xuyuan Park on the sixth day of the fourth month, with his adoptive father as the officiant. He and Tang now have one child each. The 3,000 taels of gold in the agreement have been paid to the plaintiff by his parents. However, due to urgent needs, he had borrowed 300 yuan from the plaintiff. When he became involved with Tang, he was only twenty years old, so she did not suspect that he already had a wife, and he did not say it directly. It was not until he returned to Changzhou during the summer vacation that Miss Tang learned the truth. According to Tang Manqi, when they fell in love, Hua only said that he had parents and sisters, but not a wife. She said that she would never have married him if she had known he had a wife. After returning to Changzhou after the wedding at Xuyuan Park, she learned that he was already married, but it was useless to make a fuss, so she returned to Shanghai after a week. Her parents then questioned Hua, who said he would find a way to divorce Yang. She now wants to sue Dawei as well. After mutual arguments by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Ge ordered that a date be set for the pronouncement of the judgment.</p>
<p>[P Zhao Hongen Inducement Crime&gt;</p>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhao Hongen from Anhui Province induced Ke Baidi (also known as Xingbao, sixteen years old), the daughter-in-law of Zhu Dehe from Hubei Province, who resided at No. 183 Tongxing Lane, Yangshupu Road, to the Zhongnan Hotel on Aivenyi Road for illicit cohabitation and defrauded her of her clothing. After someone reported it to the Xinzha Patrol Station, detectives arrested Zhao and the suspect Liu Jinsheng and brought them to the Provisional Court for interrogation. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo held a continued hearing. Ke's husband, Zhu Yuqing, and his father, Zhu Dehe, both appeared in court, requesting that Zhao be severely punished, and stated that if she was willing to return home, they would take her in. Ke stated that she now wished to enter the Jiliang Institute. After reviewing the case, Judge Luo found that Zhao Hongen had induced a woman under the age of twenty to leave the custody of her parents and should be punished according to the law. He sentenced him to six months imprisonment. Liu Jinsheng was found not guilty. Ke Baidi was released to the custody of her grandfather, Zhu Dehe, for supervision.</p>
<h3>Rapid Theft in Wusong</h3>
<p>The owner of Wang Yushun Salted Goods Store on Doushi Road in Wusong, Wang Asan, lives at No. 135 Xian Road. His wife, Wen, locks the door after dinner every evening and takes the children to her brother-in-law Wang Ayuan's house across the street to chat by the stove. Unexpectedly, thieves arrived the night before. After Wen left, the thieves first twisted the door of Wang Ayuan's house with wire and then pried open the door of Asan's house and entered. They went straight upstairs to Wen's bedroom and stole a valuable jewelry box from the dressing table drawer, containing three pairs of gold bracelets of various sizes and gold rings, weighing more than twelve taels in total, as well as banknotes and silver dollars worth one hundred yuan. The thieves immediately fled after obtaining the items. Their movements were extremely fast, taking less than thirty minutes. When Wen returned home and saw that the front door was open, she was very surprised and suspected something was wrong. She went upstairs to check and realized that a theft had occurred. She immediately informed her husband, Asan. Upon inspection, fortunately, 600 yuan in silver dollars stored in another drawer had not been stolen, which was fortunate in misfortune.</p>
<h3>Post-Mortem Examination of a Woman Who Jumped Out of a Window</h3>
<p>Cai Wang, a woman from Xiamen residing at No. 2241 Peng Road, had recently suffered from mental illness. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, she had a major episode and jumped from a third-story window, falling and suffering severe injuries. The police were notified, transported her to the hospital for treatment, but she died. The hospital notified the Huishi Patrol Station, which sent detectives to transport the body to the Philand Road Mortuary. The Provisional Court was notified and commissioned Judge Gao Junxiang to come to the mortuary yesterday morning to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased died from injuries sustained in the fall. Her aunt, Cai Li, was summoned to the scene to inquire about the circumstances. The body was handed over to Cai Li for coffin preparation.</p>
<h3>Man Suffering from Mental Illness Cuts His Throat</h3>
<p>Xu Hongzhang, a 23-year-old native of Ningbo, resided at No. 1080 Huade Lane, Huade Road, Hongkou. He was unmarried and worked as a painter at the Telephone Company. He had suffered from mental illness since last spring, with occasional flare-ups. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, he was sleeping in the room with his father when he suddenly woke up and got out of bed, muttering to himself. He reportedly said, "Someone at the company is talking about me, dismissing me from my job, and sending police to arrest me and take me to the court for trial." He grabbed a pair of scissors from the table and stabbed himself in the throat, about an inch deep. He bled profusely. His father woke up from the noise and saw Hongzhang covered in blood, with the scissors still in his throat.

<h3>Unruly and Wild Adulteress</h3>

<p>Finally Arrested Together</p>
<p>Cao Shiting, a native of Ningbo, is nearly forty years old and works as a driver at Central University in Wusong. His wife, Cao Yu, is thirty-two years old. The couple used to live in Lanni Ferry, Pudong. However, Cao Yu is naturally promiscuous and became inextricably involved with Zhu Jiangde, who is in his twenties. Disliking her husband's incompetence, she ran away in December 1927. She was found and brought back twice. Cao then moved to Huaanfang in front of the City God Temple in the city. However, she ran away again. She was found and brought back after a month and moved to Yangjia Tomb Hill in Pentang Lane. In June of last year, she ran away again. Before long, she was found again by Cao at the end of the year. He brought her to live in Maijia Lane, Wusong. Unexpectedly, she ran away again after only seven days, claiming to be going to a relative's house. However, Cao knowingly allowed her to leave, secretly waiting by the roadside. He saw her walk a few steps and then meet her lover, Zhu Jiangde, and walk away together. Cao secretly followed them and saw the couple go into the Zhonghe Hotel. Cao then went to fetch his younger brother and alerted the police to search the premises. They were found together in Room 4 and arrested and taken to the Seventh District Police Station. After interrogation by the judicial branch, they were transferred to the local court for trial yesterday.</p>
<h3>Failure to Repay Debt Results in Mob Violence</h3>
<p>Zhou Shaoliang, a 23-year-old native of Changzhou, is currently unemployed in Shanghai and temporarily resides with a friend at Yaojia Stone Bridge in Zhabei. Last year, he and his friend Zhang Genrong jointly opened a Dexingguan snack bar near the Xiangwu Stage in Zhabei. Due to differing opinions, they transferred the business to Zhang alone during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, with Zhang agreeing to pay Shaoliang 100 silver dollars as compensation. Zhang's brother, whose given name is Genrui, opened a Dashun Hotel at the North Railway Station and asked Zhou to temporarily lend him the 100 yuan, with interest accruing at a rate of two cents per month. Zhou reluctantly agreed out of consideration for their relationship and immediately drew up a loan agreement as proof. In October, due to financial difficulties, Shaoliang asked Zhang for 20 yuan to cover living expenses. The remaining money has not been returned to date. Wu Zhou went to collect it every few days, but Zhang always prevaricated and did not return any of it. Yesterday evening, three hooligans, Lin, Shen Duofu, and others, came to Zhou's residence, falsely claiming that Boss Zhou had ordered them to inform him that his money would be available at a certain teahouse in Hongzhen tonight. Zhou went there on time and soon saw the three young men, Lin and the others, enter, but Zhang Genrui did not come. As soon as he sat down, the three men took out three axes from their clothes and, without asking why, struck Zhou's head twice with the axes, fracturing his skull. They struck his back once, his left arm once, and his left hand once. He collapsed, bleeding profusely. The assailants then disappeared without a trace. Villagers helped him hire a rickshaw to take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Zhou's injuries are extremely critical.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Tragic Deaths</h3>
<p>Matchmaker Falls to Death on the Road: Tian Younian worked for a certain store at No. 97 Henan Road. The day before yesterday afternoon, Tian was acting as a matchmaker for someone and was carrying formal attire to the bride's house. While walking along Beijing Road at the entrance of Qingshun Lane, he suddenly fell to the ground. Tian was already seventy-two years old. After the fall, he stopped breathing. The gatekeeper patrolman of the lane went to help him, but he was already dead. He ran to report to the General Patrol Station, which sent detectives who found a business card on him and learned his name and address. They transported the body to the Philand Road Mortuary and notified the store to inform the deceased's family. Yesterday morning, the Provisional Court commissioned Judge Gao to come to the mortuary for examination. It was learned that the deceased's son worked at the Henan Railway Station on the Pinghan Railway. The deceased's nephew, Tian Baoxing, came to the scene and requested to take the body for coffin preparation. Judge Gao immediately granted the request, and Tian Baoxing took the body for preparation.</p>
<p>Man Crushed to Death by Train: At 3:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's No. 8 express train, heading from the North Station to Hangzhou, was approaching Yangqi outside Fanwangdu when a man, about thirty years old, was walking on the tracks. The driver saw him and blew the whistle as a warning. However, the man panicked and failed to avoid the train in time, resulting in him being crushed to death by the locomotive. The stationmaster of Fanwangdu Station dispatched police to take care of the situation and ordered the local Baojia to find the deceased's family to claim the body from the station.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Bill Case Transferred to Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>The Lao Zha Patrol Station detectives You A Gen, Bao Tan Xie Futang, and Cui Chengke had previously cracked a counterfeit banknote manufacturing operation in Jiangwan and Yinxianggang, seizing printing presses, models, counterfeit bills, and arresting key suspects Shen Lu, Wang, Wang Chen, Wang Zhao, Shen Gen Er, Shen A Da, Xia Da, Zhao Wenxi, Yu Ziquan, Wang Huansheng, Gu Genlin, Xi Shunbao, and Yao Huaxing, etc. and turned them in for interrogation, which has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Gao Junxiang held a joint trial. Yao Huaxing retained Attorney Shen Yuesheng for his defense. However, the Municipal Public Security Bureau claimed that the location of the cracked case was within the Chinese boundary and should be handled by the inland government, as stipulated. It specially sent an official letter to the court, dispatching personnel to apply for the transfer. After preliminary review by Judge Gao, it was immediately ruled that the defendants in this case should be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for trial. The bureau's personnel then took the criminals and evidence together.</p>
<h3>Pudong Electric Company Changes Date for Suspending Daytime Electricity Supply</h3>
<p>This Month, the Sixteenth Day</p>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company began supplying daytime electricity on May 1, 1929. However, due to equipment issues, it was stipulated that the supply would be suspended for one day each month on the 1st and 16th, National Day, and other public holidays for maintenance and repairs. Considering that many factories are closed on Sundays, for the convenience of users, it is proposed to change the method, starting from February 16, to suspend daytime electricity supply every two weeks on Sundays. It submitted a revised business charter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau for approval. The bureau believed that although the period of this change was shorter than the originally scheduled suspension of electricity supply on the 1st and 16th of each month, most factories that use electricity are closed on Sundays, so suspending electricity at the same time would not have a significant impact. Also, both parties would have convenience in repairing machinery and equipment, so it was presented to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>Datong Music Society's New Arrangement of Seasky Music</h3>
<p>Entitled Ice Flowers and Snow Moon Chapter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Datong Music Society held its first concert of the year last Sunday. It began with the National Grand Music, followed by songs such as Spring River Flower Moon Night and Rainbow Feather Dress. The director of the society, Zheng Jinwen, gave a welcome speech to the guests. Zhang Ziyu then said that there are many ancient famous songs in our country, all in the musical scores. Why not select the best and translate them? Zheng agreed with his words and decided to translate the ancient Seasky Wind qin music into a large-scale ensemble. The entire work has twelve sections. Because the melody is cold and captivating, without any sense of worldliness, it was named the Ice Flowers and Snow Moon Chapter. Retaining its original name, it is called Seasky Music. After discussion by the members, for the sake of precision, Zheng first drafted the work, dividing it into four categories: wind, strings, plucked instruments, and percussion, and issued them to specialized members, allowing each to fully utilize their strengths, freely add embellishments or break down characters, but without changing the character of the music to create a separate score. Then, they would be combined into one and a general score would be written, with a deadline of two weeks for submission and rehearsals starting in four weeks.</p>
<h3>Wusong Electricity Users' Declaration</h3>
<p>Wusong merchants have organized a United Electricity Users Association to demand that Baoming Electric Company reduce electricity charges, and have stopped paying electricity bills for January, which has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, the association widely distributed leaflets, stating in essence: The reasons for organizing this association are: 1. The electric meters used by Baoming Company are very inaccurate in terms of rate, faster than those in Shanghai, and exploit users; 2. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has already reduced electricity charges starting in January of this year, but Baoming Company remains the same, charging 23 cents per degree, a difference of five cents, which is an enormous difference. The number of units of electricity used by users each month has a limit of at least ten units per month. If only seven units are used, the electricity bill for ten units must still be paid, which is more unfair than anything else. The association's goals are: 1. Reduce electricity charges; 2. Abolish the limit; 3. Calibrate the meter; 4. Provide daytime electricity.</p>

<h3>Applauding the Arrest of Mongolian Road Robbers</h3>
<p>City Public Security Bureau, Decree No. 86 of the Legal Department, states: In order to inform about a case reported by Inspector He Yun and Deputy Inspector Yang Rong, stating that Inspector Liu Yunfang reported a robbery at the home of Xiao Yuan of Jinkang Lane, Mongolian Road, Fourth District, First Precinct. They immediately rushed to investigate and, according to the victim Xiao Yuan, at around 7:00 AM that morning, while still in bed, three robbers suddenly broke into the house. One, wearing a short black cotton-padded jacket and carrying a handgun, demanded to know the location of money and valuables, forbidding any outcry. One of the robbers woke Ms. Xiao and forcibly removed a jade ring from her finger. They then ransacked drawers and boxes for about thirty minutes. Finding nothing of value, they stole a wristwatch from a small drawer. Fortunately, a relative, Lin Rongfa, saw that only two robbers had left, and one remained inside unarmed. Lin bravely closed the door, grappling with the remaining robber. Ms. Xiao then instructed her sister to call the police. The police took the robber to the station, where, according to Station Chief Ni, the robber confessed his name was Chen Qianbao and identified his two accomplices as Zhou Yongsheng and Wang A'da, both residing at 54 Nanxing Road. Upon receiving this confession, the Station Chief dispatched officers to the address and apprehended Zhou Yongsheng. Wang A'da had fled upon hearing the news and remained at large. Upon receiving instructions, the findings of the investigation and a sketch map were submitted for review. Based on this, the findings were compiled and submitted for review. In view of this, it was found that Ni Wenbiao, Station Chief of the First Precinct, Fourth District, had submitted the apprehended robbers, Chen Qianbao and Zhou Yongsheng, to the Bureau after the robbery at the home of Xiao Yuan in Jinkang Lane, Mongolian Road. After interrogation, the suspects confessed to the robbery. The case has been submitted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for further interrogation. These robbers, daring to conspire and wield weapons, disturbed residents in the early morning, intimidating and robbing them before attempting to flee. Such behavior is extremely unlawful. The relative, Lin Rongfa, stepped forward in a moment of crisis, bravely apprehended Chen Qianbao, the remaining robber indoors, demonstrating both courage and intelligence. He is commended and awarded twenty yuan in silver to be distributed to him as a reward for his bravery. The victim, Xiao Yuan, a woman facing robbery in a moment of distress, was able to instruct her family to sound the alarm, alerting nearby police officers. Her alertness and awareness are commendable and rare. Station Chief Ni Wenbiao, upon receiving the report, immediately discovered the robbers' address and quickly apprehended the accomplice Zhou Yongsheng. His prompt action is also commendable. In addition to instructing the station to proceed accordingly, this order is hereby issued to the district and precinct captains for dissemination to all personnel for their information. This decree is issued by Director Yuan Liang on February 11th, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Persons Involved in Kidnapping Case Detained for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Xu Xueting and Yu Awen were implicated in the kidnapping of Wang Chengrong on Beijing Road on January 19th of last year. They were apprehended by Detective Cai Qishan of the D'Autre Mer Road Police Station and detained at the Provisional Court for repeated interrogations. Yesterday morning, Judge Tan Xinzhen continued the hearing. Xu maintained his innocence, stating he had no involvement in the kidnapping. He admitted that the kidnapper, known as "A," rented the upstairs of his house, but he initially did not know "A" was a kidnapper. When "A" moved, he did not inform Xu beforehand, and therefore still owed rent. Xu completely denied the statements presented by the police. Yu Awen claimed to have a legitimate business and no desire to be a criminal. He stated that in addition to running dye shops at 211 Sichuan Road and opposite the East Asia Hotel, he also worked as an inspector at the exchange, earning a daily salary of one hundred yuan. He added that the two shops had been profitable over the years and could be investigated. Judge Tan then ordered both defendants to be remanded in custody, pending the retrieval of Yu Awen's account books for further examination.</p>

Then, Vice Minister Mu instructed Director Zhang Yiou to deliver a speech. Finally, the meeting adjourned with refreshments.</p>

<h3>Relief Efforts of the Jisheng Society for the Shaanxi Famine</h3>
<p>Report from the Xi'an Branch</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society yesterday received a telegram from Lu Junhe, of the Jisheng Society's Xi'an branch, stating that since winter and the twelfth lunar month, Shaanxi province has experienced continuous heavy snow and severe cold unprecedented in decades. The famine victims have already torn down their houses for fuel and are now trapped in snow caves, without fire. They are either dying of hunger or cold. Entire families are freezing and starving to death, buried in the ice and snow. The disaster is so dire that it is unbearable to witness. The General Society has already established numerous shelters in Xi'an, Wugong, Qishan, and other counties, accommodating thousands of elderly, weak, women, and children, and the relief funds are substantial, but the Society's resources are stretched. The Xi'an shelters are full and unable to accommodate more people. There are still elderly, weak, women, and children in need of aid, waiting to die. Therefore, it is imperative to request the addition of two more shelters to save them from death. The Society has been working on relief efforts in Shaanxi for years, expending a great amount of funds. Now, the Society has taken on the tasks in Zhejiang province's Taizhou, Wenzhou, Linning, etc., Ping province's Nankou, Zhaizang, Mentougou, Anhui province's Xuanzhou, Wuhu, etc. Relief efforts in one province are already difficult, let alone several. However, the Society cannot abandon the elderly and weak awaiting death in Xi'an. Therefore, the Society cabled Xi'an yesterday, approving the addition of two shelters, limited to one thousand people, excluding the elderly, weak, women, and children already awaiting death. It was reported that the Society's relief efforts in Shaanxi are ongoing, and additional assistance is being provided to several provinces, including Zhejiang, Ping, and Anhui. The disaster is widespread, and resources are stretched to their limit. It is hoped that philanthropists will contribute resources to alleviate this suffering, as the disaster victims in all provinces are relying on the Society's efforts.</p>
<h3>Indigo Dye Workers Urge Cloth Industry to Increase Allowance for Drink Money</h3>
<p>Indigo dye workers in this city, feeling the strain of rising prices and the difficulty of making a living, have requested an increase in drink money from the Cloth Industry Association. After many days of no response, the Shanghai Indigo Dye Workers' Union sent a letter to the Cloth Industry Association yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our union members, feeling the hardship of life, proposed on February 4th to your association that drink money be increased appropriately. The amount requested may seem large on the surface, but it is not excessive in proportion to current prices. In short, the cloth and dye industries are interconnected. Although our colleagues are just laborers, they understand the big picture. Would they only care about their own benefit and not consider the benefit of others? However, it has been eight days and your association has not given a definite reply. It is a pity. If your association has any difficulties, you should frankly report and discuss it fairly. Your Association's disinterest is unacceptable. Due to the workers from each factory asking after this matter, another letter has been issued with the hope of a prompt and complete answer. (The rest omitted)"</p>

<h3>Handball Game at the Central Sports Field</h3>
<p>Players' Performance is Remarkable</p>
<p>The Central Sports Field on Avenue Joffre and Route Amiral Bayle has been open for over seven days. Because of the novelty of the ball game, there are many spectators. However, many people do not understand the true meaning of the ball game. According to an internal staff member, this kind of ball game depends entirely on sharp eyesight and great strength. Skill and intelligence are equally important. At first glance, it is not very interesting, but upon careful observation, the wonderfulness of the skills is amazing and inspiring. The game is divided into single matches, double matches, and special matches, etc. In a single match, one person competes against another. In a double match, two people form a team, and one team competes against another.</p>
<p>Rules of the game: The playing field is surrounded by walls on three sides and divided into fifteen squares. The fourth square is called the "fault line," and the seventh square is called the "inner court line." Players must serve the ball by hitting it hard within the frame on the front wall. When the ball returns to the fourth square, the opponent catches it with a rattan basket worn on the right hand and hits it hard against the wall again. Then, the two sides take turns hitting the ball back and forth. If one side fails to catch the ball, they lose one point. According to the rules, the ball must be caught after bouncing on the ground once to be valid. If the ball bounces twice before being caught, the player loses one point and is out of the game. Each match uses a round-robin system. For example, if the first player plays the second player and the second player loses, the first player then plays the third player. The players fight in a circuit until one of them scores five points to win. Another example, a single match of five players means the first to get five points wins. A doubles match of six teams, meaning first to six points wins. And so on. There are also exceptions: special games that must get 20 points to win.</p>
<p>Dates of the Games: The fifth round of games has now been changed and scheduled for Friday and Saturday nights at 9 PM. There will be two games on Sunday, one at 3 PM and one at 9 PM.</p>

<h3>Mourning Mr. Yu Huizun</h3>
<p>-- Wu Yancheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Huizun, a respected elder of the Six Heng Village in Dinghai. His given name was Zhaoxiong, and in his later years, he went by the alias Weicun. During the Qing Dynasty imperial examination era, scholars focused solely on examination essays and were unwilling to study the classics and history, leading to criticism for their lack of substance. Mr. Yu alone enjoyed reading ancient books. His poems, prose, and lyrics drew heavily on the classics and history, embodying their essence and beauty, and were widely admired by scholars at the time. During the county and prefectural academy examination periods, he would occasionally submit his work and always ranked at the top. However, talent is often met with adversity. Despite repeated recommendations, he never passed the higher-level examinations and remained a senior licentiate for life. The people of the town admired Mr. Yu's learning and competed to hire him to teach their children. Therefore, many gentlemen, merchants, and people from all walks of life in Shanghai today are his students. He had a literary friendship with my late uncle, Mr. Ziyu, and they were the closest of friends. Our family also hired him to teach and provided meals, so I was also one of his students. Mr. Yu was short-sighted and kept his hands on his books at all times, which eventually led to blindness in his later years. Mr. Yu was morally upright and gentle in nature. He never argued with others and did not like to hear about external affairs. The inhabitants of the isolated island of Six Heng mostly worked in fishing and salt production, and there was a lack of educational seeds. Mr. Yu's learning and writing were respected by the villagers, and he was publicly elected as the village head. However, this was not what Mr. Yu desired. The islanders had limited knowledge and did not understand any new policies. Others were responsible, but they focused their criticism on Mr. Yu. The seventy-year-old man sacrificed himself. His entire family of four also died for Mr. Yu. Alas, the rioters killed him and then burned his house. How cruel! More than ten years ago, I often corresponded with Mr. Yu, but recently, due to mundane matters, we had not been in contact for a long time. When the terrible news arrived, I could not help but cry aloud. Alas, why does Heaven not bless good people? Or is Heaven about to abandon culture?</p>

<h3>Honeymoon Insurance</h3>
<p>— Jī Jìn</p>
<p>According to Western customs, after a wedding, the couple must travel together to famous scenic spots or major cities, which is called the honeymoon. According to a friend, the Parker &amp; Company in New York, USA, is established for this type of insurance. They usually focus on various newspapers. Upon seeing a wedding announcement, they will send someone to persuade the newlyweds. If the new couple agrees and designates the destination, all travel by boat or car, as well as food and accommodation, can be handled at any time. The insurance premium is very cheap, divided into ordinary and special types. It is said that the ordinary type costs only two shillings per person per day. If an accident occurs, the company will immediately compensate for the loss according to the regulations. This is also an innovative insurance method.</p>

<p>Residence and daily life orders. It is actually the earliest official gazette. This old newspaper also has advertisements, published by the official printing office. By the time of the Cromwellian civil strife, the newspaper industry began to gradually develop.</p>
<p>A recent newspaper magazine carried a drawing titled "The Future of a Journalist." Eyes like Yama (the king of hell), like a thousand-mile eye. Ears like Bajie (Pigsy), like all-hearing ears. Head with horns. Spine with fins. The left hand is a writing brush. The right hand becomes a draft paper. Feet with wheels. Moves like flying. Water, land, and air, without obstruction. It is said that in the future, one must be like this to fully realize the ability of a journalist.</p>
<p>The country with the most widespread newspapers in the world is Denmark. It has 3,200 daily publications, 750 periodicals, and a total circulation of 1.11 million. The national population is 3.4 million. On average, one newspaper is read per three people.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Boluo in Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Mǐn Hǎi Bó Yá</p>
<p>There is a Cantonese saying, "First, marry a wife; second, travel to Boluo." These two phrases are thought-provoking. When I traveled to Boluo, I realized that it does indeed have the same flavor as marrying a wife.</p>
<p>Boluo County is in the east of Guangdong. In the middle is the Hongsheng Temple. Every year on the thirteenth day of the first month, it is the saint's birthday. The incense is very prosperous. During the late Qing Dynasty, there was a royal sacrificial ceremony. Therefore, the custom of traveling to Boluo has not disappeared to this day. Every year on this day, people come and go at the ferry, and men and women are like clouds, endless. And "Boluo Bathing in the Sun" is one of the Eight Scenic Spots of Yangcheng. The temple is located on the mountainside. Looking into the distance, the sunlight rises from the opposite sea. Its glow and the waves reflect each other, almost making one feel as if one is in Fusang (Japan). It is truly worthy of being one of the Eight Scenic Spots of Yangcheng. Below the temple, there is a shallow sandy beach, about two zhang (approximately 6.67 meters) from the shore. The water only reaches the ankles. However, the tourists are neatly dressed. Who would be willing to walk barefoot? This has become a speculative business for ordinary "pearl ladies" (young women). On this day, the pearl ladies all dress up beautifully, wear shorts, and make a living carrying people across the shore to the temple. Their income is indeed substantial, and it also allows those who are carried to taste the flavor of "chicken head meat" (a slang term for being taken advantage of). The saying that marrying a wife is likened to traveling to Boluo refers to this.</p>
<p>On that day, the temple sells a large quantity of paper chickens, called Boluo Chickens. Those who return from traveling to Boluo must carry one in their hands, saying that this may bring good luck for the year. It is also said that immortals personally visit the area every year, such as the Wang Yeren (a legendary figure) disguised as selling glutinous rice balls. Those with immortal bones can ascend to immortality by eating these glutinous rice balls. It is also said that Lü Chunyang (a Taoist immortal) also used magic to sell paper Boluo Chickens every year. Among them, there must be one that can crow and herald the morning. These are all strange tales from Qi State. Just listen to them casually.</p>
<h3>Two Interesting Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Sōng Bīn Tīng Tāo Kè</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the Beijing-Shanghai train, the long journey was boring. I happened to hear a passenger chatting and learned two interesting anecdotes. Some may think they are fictitious, but the narrator spoke with certainty, and it didn't seem like fabrication. Because the matter is quite interesting, I recorded it in writing to submit it to this column.</p>
<p>Resourceful Couple: In a residence on Xiafei Road, Xiafei Lane, two thieves suddenly visited one day. One thief, holding a Browning pistol, entered the room first, threatening the people inside to hand over the key to the safe. While the man was hesitating, his wife calmly said to the thief, "Don't hurt anyone. The key can be given." Then she told her husband to go and get the key. Seeing this, the thief thought they were cowards, so he held the gun and followed the man. The wife also followed behind the thief. The thief didn't pay attention to her because she was a weak woman. Unexpectedly, in an instant, the wife suddenly kicked the thief's elbow holding the gun with her foot. The gun fell to the ground. The thief was shocked and didn't know what to do. The wife immediately stepped forward and firmly grabbed him. Her husband also quickly turned around, picked up the gun, and aimed it at the thief. The thief dared not move. Looking at</p>
<p>Red Carpet</p>
<h3>A Record of Watching Xun Huisheng's "Fragrant Silk Ribbon"</h3>
<p>— Lǎo Zhuō</p>
<p>On the evening of the seventh, I watched a performance at the Grand Theatre. The main act was "Fragrant Silk Ribbon," one of Xun Huisheng's finest new plays. The plot is very similar to the Bangzi opera "Three Suspicious Plans." However, "Three Suspicious Plans" ends with an apology. After the apology in this play, it continues with Tang Tong's expedition, where he encounters thieves at an inn. He is bound with a fragrant silk ribbon, beheaded, and his body is abandoned. This leads the crowd to suspect the corpse is Tang's. The police even falsely accused Tang's wife and her relative, Du, of adultery. Fortunately, Tang's teacher has already passed the imperial examination and was appointed as an investigating censor. When touring this county, he reviewed the case and suddenly recalled the midnight knocking on the door years ago. He forcefully ruled it as a case of adultery and murder. When they were about to be executed, Tang returned, and the injustice was cleared. The second half of the play's plot is quite similar to "Selling Er'e After Cutting off Her Feet." It is difficult for new plays to escape the conventions of old plays. They are generally similar. But speaking of the play itself, Tang's wife, Lin, played by Huisheng, is forced by her husband to knock on Lu's teacher's door late at night. And the police falsely accuse her and her relative, Du, of adultery and murdering her husband. Undeserved misfortune, suffering alone. Writing the intangible sorrow is more difficult than writing the tangible sorrow. The author maintains a quiet and virtuous attitude throughout, which is very consistent with the identity of the character in the play. And the performance is neither impulsive nor following the trend, but only a sense of infinite sadness. The so-called heart is ten times more bitter than the autumn lotus. Huisheng is really good at portraying the characters. The singing, starting with the Xipi San Yan in the first scene, contains new melodies, which is exceptionally beautiful. The song "Urging Makeup," in Er Liu meter, is melancholy in its lyrics, and so is the singing. In the courtroom, the eight sentences of the Fan Er Yao Ban have ever-changing melodies. No beats are more difficult than having beats, but this is Huisheng's specialty. Listening closely, Huisheng's voice is fine, but the articulation is extremely clear. The inflections and releases, the light and heavy, fast and slow, are all in harmony with the rhythm and achieve perfection. This shows the sharp progress of her skills over the years. Assisted by Zhang Chunyan as Tang Tong, the rude man; Jin Zhongren as Lu Shike, with a strong scholar's air; and Ma Lu as Du, the rogue of the city, they are all suitable for their talents and deserve to be called excellent performances.</p>
<p>the wind, the thief outside peered in and raised his Browning pistol, and could only surrender. The narrator said that the couple must be skilled in martial arts. Otherwise, how could they be so brave?</p>
<p>Accidental Encounter with One's Own People: Doctor A knew a ruffian named B and had treated him before. One night, Doctor A was walking alone in an alley, wearing a thick coat and hat. Suddenly, he encountered someone stripping him bare. While struggling, he saw in the lamplight that it was someone he knew. Doctor A smiled and said, "Now I've met my own people. What will you do?" B was ashamed and couldn't answer. Doctor A untied his pouch, gave him some coins, and left.</p>
<h3>Chì Sōng Zǐ (Red Pine Nut)</h3>
<p>— Jūn Měi</p>
<p>Yesterday at the spring banquet of Mr. Wang, I recognized a dish. Its taste was fresh and delicious, with a sour fragrance that permeated the lungs. It was wrapped in yellow mud and called Chì Sōng Zǐ. Because of its shape, all the guests, old or young, didn't know what it was after a quick gamble. They were surprised that they had never tasted it before and didn't know how to eat it. They asked Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang said, "It's not difficult. You can remove the mud with bamboo chopsticks and open the paper. First, suck the soup. Then remove the shell and eat it with vinegar. It should have a wonderful taste." So the guests were eager to try it. The sound of bamboo chopsticks, breathing, and shell cracking mixed together. Everyone thought it was a miraculously delicious dish. They asked to describe the method. Mr. Wang said, "This is a family dish. The method is to take a raw egg, grind a small hole, and inject shrimp meat, add soy sauce, and add Ajinomoto (MSG). After the inner layer is complete, seal the hole with hard paper, spread chili sauce on the shell, soak it in a vinegar bowl for three or four minutes, take it out and store it in a bowl, and steam it. It's cooked. Its taste is as good as delicacies from land or sea." I recorded it when I returned home. The aftertaste is still there. Not wanting to keep it a secret, I recorded it to share with like-minded people.</p>
<h3>Wit Born of Desperation</h3>
<p>— Shuāng Dāi</p>
<p>If a man is harassed by prostitutes in the middle of the road and cannot get rid of them, he only needs to say softly, "I have sores all over my body." They will definitely let go and leave. I have tried it many times and it has always worked.</p>
<p>When cashiers of money shops or inns are escorting silver dollars (this method does not apply to those wrapped in cloth or rattan baskets) and encounter bandits robbing them along the way, they should loudly pretend to say, "There are military supplies in the bag… I hope you don't misunderstand." When the thieves hear "military supplies," they will hesitate and not dare to act immediately. Then shout loudly, "Military supplies!" to easily attract the attention of passers-by and detectives, and you may be spared.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (127)</h3>
<p>— Bāo Tiān Xiào</p>
<p>Chapter 8: The Delicate Birds Sing and the Flowers Bloom at the Qióng Feast / The Golden House is Decorated, and the Good Bird Chooses the Wood</p>
<p>Zuǒ Shīchén said, "I heard that the madams in the brothels often beat and scold people they keep… Have they ever beaten you?" Ruǐyún said, "Scolding is unavoidable, but I've never been beaten. I've suffered a lot. Besides my parents, this 'Big Aunt' (madam) has been the best to me. Because my business has been very good since I started working. Now, I have to sing thirty or forty songs every day. Of course, they also make a lot of money off of me. So, she naturally flatters me, calling me 'sweetie' all the time… But if I have a few days with fewer songs or a week without any customers, she'll pout and scowl. Even if she doesn't say anything, I know she's unhappy. Even when I call to her, she answers listlessly, as if she's not responding. But it's still good, because I've suffered so much in these few years. Compared to that, it's not too bad… I can tell you in detail about it another day." Zuǒ Shīchén was about to ask her how she was sold from her family when he saw the Big Aunt come out. She said, "Sweetie, dinner is already served in the pavilion. I specially told them to cook the grass that you like to eat… Young Master, you're welcome to come and sit in the pavilion, too." Zuǒ Shīchén followed her in. Ruǐyún then took Shīchén's hand and said, "Today, I saw your friend, Zheng Seven Young Master, who is always at the racetrack across the street… I ran into him at the Yiqingxian Pavilion. He even asked about you, saying, 'Has Second Young Master Zuǒ called?'" Shīchén said, "Who is hosting the party at the Yiqingxian Pavilion?" Ruǐyún said, "It's someone named Xu. Everyone calls him 'Special Photo'… Big Aunt, why do they call him 'Special Photo'? Is that kind of nickname?" Shīchén said, "Special Photo means a handsome face. Because Shanghainese call the face a 'photo.' For example, to ask if someone's face is good-looking, they'll say, 'Is his photo new?' Now that they're calling him 'Special Photo,' he must have a handsome face." Ruǐyún said, "Yiqing dressed up as a man today and looked very good… Someday, I want to dress up as a man, too." The Big Aunt said, "Yiqing is taller than you. She looks good dressed as a man. You're shorter than her. Men's clothes won't look good on you." Ruǐyún said, "Today, Yiqing wore a foreign-style hunting cap… She arranged beads into the two characters 'Yiqing' and fastened them on the hat. Everyone said she looked good. Tomorrow, I'll arrange beads into the two characters 'Ruǐyún' and fasten them on the hat… or put them on a small melon-cap… That would also be special." Shīchén said, "That kind of special… You'd also become a 'Special Photo.'" Ruǐyún rolled her eyes at Shīchén and continued, "You always say I wear that kind of beaded veil… It's old-fashioned… It's not popular now… I look like a little old lady." The Big Aunt said, "The weather is getting warmer… You don't need to wear a beaded veil anyway."</p>

<h3>Gold Price Rises Again</h3>
<p>Silver Prices Fall, Exchange Market Tightens, and Public Sentiment Shows Optimism: Yesterday, February 11th, the price of gold rose again, probably because the overseas silver market has fallen again and the exchange rate is also tending to tighten. Colleagues have tried to buy in, but the buying and selling within each market vary, but there is no large number of transactions. Yuan Sheng, Yu Da, Shun Li, Wan Xing, etc., all bought in, while Fu Chang, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Bing Xing, etc., all sold out. Public sentiment seems to be hopeful, and there is a difference of 4 liang between the before and after market calculations. Since the large bars were reduced in the morning, they have risen by 3 liang. Later, it slightly dropped by 1 liang, because sellers were very active and the exchange rate was strong.

<h3>Public Debt Falls Slightly More Sharply</h3>
<p>Transaction volume: 4 million yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price fluctuations of various bonds in the local securities market were relatively large, and market sentiment was active. It was rumored in the market that there were other changes in the Longhai Railway area, and sentiment suddenly turned weak. The price decline of bonds was therefore vigorous. The price dropped significantly at the beginning of the morning. The second session was slightly more peaceful. As a result, the customs duty three-month futures fell by 1.2 yuan, which was the largest decline. The two-month futures, the complete 6-year, 7-year, and Sequel 25 and other three-month futures all fell by 0.8 to 0.9 yuan, and the others also fell by small amounts of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. Only the Sequel 25 and customs duty spot bonds rose uniquely. Statistics show that the spot transactions between the two sessions were only 10,000 yuan, while the futures reached 3.99 million yuan. The Sequel Bonds and Sequel Rolls each accounted for 880,000 to 890,000 yuan, customs duty for 790,000 yuan, Sequel 25 for 620,000 yuan, and 96 for only 165,000 yuan. The 7-year financial bonds were still scarce, with a total of only 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Struggle to Improve</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat, and the trend remains weak. This is because there is no significant improvement in actual sales. Factories have a large backlog of yarn, and sentiment is very soft. Most people are bearish, but the major players are holding steady. Judging from the current market situation, it is difficult for prices to rise significantly. However, the period is during the spring sales season, and if all parties develop formally, the yarn market may rebound. The spot sales are expected to be cleared out, and pure futures are trending downwards. For the sake of stability, customers are temporarily standing by and waiting for the right moment. The future of the yarn market is still in a process of change.</p>
<p>There is a lack of improvement in the bid for yarn. At the opening of the morning session, the spot price rose along with the rise in foreign cotton, and the situation was more tense. All months rose by one or two to eight or nine cents. The market situation changed suddenly in the second and third sessions, and a falling trend suddenly emerged. Due to rumors of the current situation, there were more new sellers. As a result, the current month rose by two cents, the middle month was stable, and the far month fell by 0.2 to 0.4 cents. The market stabilized slightly in the afternoon, and those who profited hedged, and the market sentiment turned strong. All months rose by 0.1, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.9 cents. The total turnover for the day was 16,600 bales. The closing prices of the bid for yarn are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Bid for Yarn Closing Prices | Increase/Decrease | Inventory</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>May 156 | Up 0.04 | 3,400</p>

<p>April 156.1 | Up 0.01 | 34,650</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales are Still Good. The statistics for the whole day show that various customers bought a total of 1,270 bales, and the same industry bought 525 bales. The market is flat. Among the customers, the Hankou customers bought the most, accounting for 300 bales. In addition, 200 bales were bought in the inland, 35 bales in Qinhuangdao, 230 bales in Sichuan, 40 bales in Xuzhou, 90 bales in Tianjin, 25 bales in Guangdong, 65 bales in Wuhu, 35 bales in Niuzhuang, 40 bales in Qingdao, 95 bales in Jiangxi, 25 bales in Yantai, 25 bales in Anqing, 65 bales were bought from miscellaneous sources, and 200-300 bales were bought directly from the factory.

<h3>The Origin of High Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>American Cotton Rebounds... Hankou Customers Go Long</p>
<p>The cotton market has stabilized. The telegram from American cotton showed a rebound. The local market atmosphere is upward. Due to the high land prices, Hankou customers are buying large quantities of cotton futures in the futures market, so the market price has slightly increased. However, the spot cotton sales are not very prosperous. This is because the factories have already ordered a lot of Indian cotton. There is no urgent need for local cotton at present. However, some people think that the consumption of American cotton has decreased and they are bearish. Japanese short sellers have also closed their positions. The future of the cotton market may be unstable for a while.</p>
<p>The Hankou Bid Rebounds by 0.04-0.05 Yuan. At the opening of the morning session of cotton futures, the selling pressure in the market decreased greatly due to the rebound of American cotton by 0.3-0.4 pounds. Retail investors scrambled to hedge, and the prices of all months rose by 0.04-0.05 yuan. In the second and third sessions, long positions were closed, and the market suddenly fell by 0.02-0.04 yuan. As a result, it only rose by 0.01-0.02 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation was slightly stronger due to the buying of Hankou customers, and the prices of all months rose by 0.025-0.03 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 41,900 dan. The closing prices of the Hankou bid are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Hankou Bid Closing Prices | Increase/Decrease | Inventory | Closing Prices | Increase/Decrease | Inventory</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>February 34.85 | Up 0.030 | 46,700 | May 34.70 | Up 0.045 | 63,800</p>
<p>March 34.65 | Up 0.040 | 65,900 | June 34.80 | Up 0.050 | 44,600</p>
<p>April 34.70 | Up 0.040 | 69,500 | July 34.80 | Up 0.045 | 22,100</p>
<p>The Spot Demand Shows a Slight Improvement. Spot cotton factories are more active. Japanese merchants are also starting to purchase at the same time. The source of goods at the wharf includes 100 bales of Yaohua cotton. The sales records are listed below.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Rebounds by 40 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rebounded due to good news from Liverpool and short covering. Buying interest was strong. The futures rose by 0.33-0.40 pounds, and the spot rose by 0.35 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 5-6 points, and the spot rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 15 points. Indian cotton is firm due to gradual imports. Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, deferred rose by 2 rupees, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, forward rose by 3-4 rupees. Bailuoxi near and far terms rose by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3>Among Grains, Only Medium-Grade Japonica Rice Rose by a Dime</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were not many boats arriving from various customers, about 17 or 18. Market sales were slightly active. High-quality North Japonica rice still opened at around 18.80 yuan. However, medium-grade Japonica rice turned up nearly a dime because the sales market saw abundance. The price of thin rice arriving and being sold was flat and did not rise or fall. Only the extra-high-quality goods continued to be firm. Due to the arrival of foreign rice, the sales of Yandu Xian rice in this street were sluggish, and the market was struggling to maintain the original price. The goods at the bottom of the boat were slightly trimmed. The customers of the outport Xian rice were not strong, and the selection was strict. Although the overall market did not move, the market was normal. Binyin Yuan's arrival and removal were light, and the price was a small margin. In the whole day's market, only the medium-grade Japonica rice was strong.</p>
<p>Hunan: The source of goods arriving from Hebei was still scarce, and the sales market was slightly better. High-quality Changxi North Japonica rice was very little, so the ordinary good goods opened at 18 yuan left, and there was not much rise or fall compared with the previous session. The falling trend of Su Tongji rice has been determined, and the removal is refreshing, showing a stable appearance. Market customers' thin rice and Tinglin and other early rice have also turned flat, because the northern market is trending firm, and customers are therefore selling, and the transaction is refreshing. The street sales of Yandu Xian rice were inconsistent, such as customers with not much inventory, eating prices slightly wider, and the market had a half-angle difference. The transaction of Binyin Yuan was rare, the price was stagnant and tired, and the Diaowei of Yinyuan was not smooth, and the ordinary one opened at 15.12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Rises by a Dime</h3>
<p>Futures are also better by 0.02-0.03 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market continued to be good. This is because the inventory in the market is very dry, and the source of goods will not arrive at the port until four or five days later. At this time of shortage, there is a smooth sale of foreign customers in Ningbo and Beiyang this street, and the market has gradually improved. Yesterday, the current foreign rice only opened 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1, the price was 14.25-14.2 yuan, and 500 bags of No. 2, the price was 13.95 yuan, all of which were increased compared with the previous market price. The futures have also Ningbo and mainland scrambled to bid, and the price is also better than the previous market price of 0.02-0.03 yuan. It is said that more than 10,000 bags of Saigon were sold, and 23,000 bags of Xiaojiao were sold, mainly based on road goods and recent periods.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Near Term Firm, Distant Term Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was firm and stable in the near term, and flat and tired in the distant term. In February and March, the inventory was not abundant after all, and the factory was unwilling to release more empty codes. Although the inventory of the factories in this port, according to private speculations, the total of flour and wheat is about 2 million bags, the number of releases has been limited. The arrival of raw materials has no hope of increasing, so we should hold on to the sale of Chen flour. The market has recovered to stability, which is the reason for this. In the distant term, the foreign wheat was slightly better by about 0.4 yuan, and people's hearts were quite pretty. Then, the number of throws saw a surge, and it turned to be tired and stagnant. From the recent trend in June, the price of 250 copper coins will stand, and the result is that the current month is 0.01 better than the previous day, April is 0.005 better, May is 0.0025 better, June is 0.005 worse, and July is 0.0025 better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market is Clear and Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market seemed to be trending stable in each month in the morning and afternoon openings. In the morning, because the quotation of foreign wheat was slightly better and the flour market also changed from tired to settled, the people's hearts were no longer as empty and stagnant as before. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, because the new buying customers were not very strong and the throwing customers were rare, the transactions in each market felt very cold. Looking at the situation after this, the recent period should be shifted with flour sales. The distant period depends half on the weather and half on the attitude of the inland customer. If the wheat seedlings gradually grow luxuriantly, all people's hearts will change uniformly. The result is that the current month is 0.01 better in the morning, March is 0.02 better, April is 0.01 better, June is 0.01 better, and July is 0.02 better. In the current wheat market, the extra-high-quality goods are still in demand by factories, so the shouting price is higher by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 5 taels and 30 copper coins, yellow buckwheat at 5 taels 32 copper coins, Hankou wheat at 5 taels 25 copper coins, 5 taels 20 copper coins, 5 taels 15 copper coins, 5 taels 5 copper coins, and inferior to 4 taels 95 copper coins, with a total of more than 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Real Sales of Textile Goods are Developing Daily</h3>
<p>The textile market saw ups and downs yesterday. The real sales of Nanhua and other ports are gradually active, especially the Shantou customers' buying power is the strongest. Yesterday, more than 150 pieces were traded, among which blue striped satin and flower marks are the most important. Fuzhou's willingness to handle matters is relatively weak because the current situation has not reached Anning. Wenzhou and Taizhou bought a lot of fine cloth yesterday. Yueyan was 8 taels and 50 copper coins, Shile Wu 7 taels and 60 copper coins, Shuanglongzhu 7 taels and 45 copper coins. The transactions in this street have also greatly improved. Inland customers from Changzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, etc. have all arrived in Shanghai one after another, so yesterday's fair bidding was unanimously and sharply increased. However, Donghuo was slightly weakened by the decline in third-class products. The flower mark was about 0.05 yuan. Yesterday, Chongshenba, 4 taels and 20 copper coins, was willing to sell a lot. Fine Beijing opera Hundred Sons Tu Fengbo Pavilion opened at 0.24 yuan, which was also slightly smaller than before. However, the Western goods were stimulated by the bidding frenzy and the people's hearts were firmer. Therefore, the opening price of the red market has not fallen for the time being. Fu Chouben Street needs a lot, and more than 100 pieces of striped and plain variegated colors were entered yesterday. Because of the high price, there are fewer written orders for plain foreign yarn than in previous years. Yesterday, Yiji's Five Phoenix Building Jade Butterfly Yuan color opened at 16 taels, bald white at 14 taels and 50 copper coins, and Jinweiwei bald Yuan at 13 taels and 50 copper coins, and Taihe Ruyi Tianguan at 12 taels and 50 copper coins.</p>
<h3>Sources of Silk, Tea, Lu Huang, and Grey Warp Have Stopped</h3>
<p>Due to Qingdao Implementing Local Goods Export Public Scale Tax</p>
<p>Yellow Grey Silk Warp is a special product of Shandong Province, which has always been shipped from Qingdao and Yantai to Shanghai by wheel, and sold to various foreign firms by Shanghai-based banks for export. Recently, the source of Yellow Grey Silk Warp suddenly stopped, and Shanghai Zhuang telegraphed the place of origin for inquiries. Now receiving a reply telegram roughly says that this is because the Qingdao authorities have implemented the local goods export public scale tax, and the business community has risen up to oppose it, while the official office insists on its implementation, so they have temporarily suspended business and transportation in an attempt to resist it. It is feared that it will be difficult to ship Yellow Grey Silk Warp for a while.</p>

<h3>Recent Automobile Numbers in Shanghai by Ding Zuze</h3>
<p>According to the automobile registration numbers at the Traffic Department of the British and French Municipal Councils in this city, the number has increased by 20% in the past year. This progress can be said to be rapid. On January 1st of last year, the total number of registered automobiles in the two concessions of this city, including passenger cars, trucks, and motorcycles, was 10,167. On January 1st of this year, the total was 12,380. In addition, the business permits for cars tested in the county are not included.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned 12,380 automobiles, there are approximately 400 different brands. Among them, about 20 of the most famous brands can be identified. The number of these 20 brands accounts for almost half of the total.</p>
<p>There are about 15 automobile dealers in this city. Most of the brands they sell are Ford, Chevrolet, Buick, Morris, Chrysler, Flyer, Citroen, Renault, and Austin. In addition, there are several dealers selling trucks and motorcycles.</p>
<p>Judging from the above-mentioned numbers, the increase in the past year is 2,213 vehicles. However, this is contradictory to the actual situation. In reality, the automobile dealers in this city sell no more than 2,000 new cars each year. And only two companies sell the most: one sells about 700 vehicles, and the other sells about 500 vehicles per year.</p>
<p>However, according to the automobile dealers, there is another reason. In recent years, most automobile sales involve trading old cars for new cars. After purchasing a new car, the owner simply hangs the old license on the new car and does not re-register with the Municipal Council. If the old car is still sold in this city, then this second owner will find that one more car is added when registering with the Municipal Council. However, most old cars traded for new cars no longer appear on the roads of this city. Some of these old cars are transported to the interior, some are discarded as useless, and some cannot be sold. If the number of imported cars from the customs is used as a basis, it is also not accurate, because the imported cars are not all sold in Shanghai. Therefore, it is indeed not easy to investigate the number of new cars added in this city each year.</p>
<p>Now, a table is listed below to show the detailed numbers of various vehicles registered in the two concessions on January 1st of the past two years:</p>
<p>British Concession　　French Concession</p>
<p>1929　1930　1929　1930</p>
<p>Private Passenger Cars　4171　4783　2613　3078</p>
<p>Commercial Passenger Cars　393　541　342　465</p>
<p>Private Trucks　615　701　528　648</p>
<p>Commercial Trucks　498　833　241　489</p>
<p>Motorcycles　624　737　142　115</p>
<p>From the above table, except for the decrease in motorcycles in the French Concession, all types of vehicles have increased.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the famous automobiles in this city, Buick cars have been the most numerous in previous years. At its peak, there were a total of 982 vehicles. Unfortunately, it has decreased to 941 vehicles three months ago. Ford cars and Morris cars have been making rapid progress. This year, the leading position will be occupied by Ford cars or Morris cars. Chevrolet cars are also a rising star. According to the registration of passenger cars, there are currently 825 Ford cars, 794 Morris cars, and 625 Chevrolet cars. On October 1st of last year, there were only 778 Ford cars, 772 Morris cars, and 591 Chevrolet cars.</p>
<p>The following table lists the famous automobiles in this city in order of quantity:</p>
<p>British Concession　French Concession　Total</p>
<p>Ford　803　671　1474</p>
<p>Chevrolet　498　405　982</p>
<p>Buick　639　343　982</p>
<p>Morris　487　352　839</p>
<p>Overland　302　169　471</p>
<p>Flyer　300　136　436</p>
<p>Studebaker　297　115　412</p>
<p>Citroen　175　225　400</p>
<p>Austin　224　116　340</p>
<p>Essex　181　142　323</p>
<p>Renault　135　181　316</p>
<p>Nash　198　101　299</p>
<p>Chrysler　115　99　214</p>
<p>The above, except for Buick, Nash, and Chrysler, all include trucks. And among them, eight types are American goods, two are British goods, two are French goods, and one is Italian goods. Therefore, it can be seen that most of the automobiles in this city are made in the United States. This is because American cars accelerate very quickly, are long and wide, and have large cylinders. Although other countries are trying to imitate them, people from various countries still mostly purchase American cars. However, most of the motorcycles in this city are made in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Although the number of automobiles increases every year, this year is not optimistic. Due to the recent impact of the high price of gold and the low price of silver, the original price of automobiles must increase by at least 20%.</p>
<h3>A General Discussion of the German Automobile Industry by Huang Yingdai</h3>
<p>Recently, the automobile industries of various European countries have been competing fiercely with the United States. This is something that everyone knows. Among the various European countries, the German automobile industry has also been developing rapidly in recent years. And the recent business policies of German automobile factories are focused on improving the quality of their products to prevent the import of foreign automobiles. According to a German newspaper, the total number of imported foreign automobiles in April and May of last year was 2,526, with a value of 7,574,000 marks. In April and May of 1928, the number of imported automobiles was 3,636, with a value of 14,685,000 marks. In comparison, it can be seen that the import of German automobiles decreased significantly last year compared to the previous year. According to customs reports, the number of automobiles imported last year was only one-third of the previous year. The rest were all bodies and chassis. On the other hand, in the first four months of last year, the import of domestic automobiles was 37,997, while in the same period of 1928, it was only 25,394. It can be seen that the sales of German automobiles in recent years have not declined, but have been developing year by year. However, the import of foreign automobiles will gradually decrease. This is also sufficient evidence of the development of German domestic products. However, most German automobile factories have foreign investment. For example, General Motors and Ford have branches in Germany. Therefore, in reality, although German automobile factories have been developing rapidly in recent years, a portion of their rights have still been seized by foreigners.</p>
<p>The German automobile industry is as described above, and the German motorcycle industry has also been gradually developing recently. This is because the German people have recently been fond of riding motorcycles, so the production of motorcycles has also been increasing day by day. According to the report of Vossiche Zllung in Berlin, the total number of motorcycles produced by German factories in the six months from January to June of last year was 115,000, while in the six months from January to June of the previous year, it was only 70,000. The difference is more than one-third. Moreover, Germans prefer to ride small motorcycles, so the motorcycles produced by various factories have recently adopted a policy of producing mostly small-sized motorcycles in order to cater to social psychology and make them easier to sell. For example, the Opel factory and other automobile factories all adopt this policy. As for large motorcycles with a price of more than US$500, a total of 41,500 were produced in the six months from January 1st to July 1st of last year, a decrease of 10% compared to the same period in 1928. On the other hand, when Germans buy motorcycles, they recently prefer to choose those priced from 75 to 150 yuan. Therefore, the production of small motorcycles has suddenly increased in recent years. The production in the past two years has increased tenfold compared to 1927. How can we not be surprised when we hear this? The registration of German motorcycles ranks second in the world in terms of quantity. As of January 1, 1929, the total number of motorcycle registrations in various countries was 724,830 in the United Kingdom, 465,000 in Germany, 320,000 in France, and 121,656 in the United States. Therefore, Germany is the most numerous except for the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>One country that has been affected by the development of the German automobile industry is Poland. And the speed of the promotion of the public bus industry in Poland is particularly surprising. According to the survey by the American Polish Chamber of Commerce, Poland had only 412 public buses in 1925, but now there are 2,900. Among them, the majority are made in the United States. In addition to Warsaw, major Polish cities and towns, such as Popnan, Lwow, Cracow, Wilna, Lublin, Cpesochowg, and Binlystolk, all have public bus lines. Travelers in rural towns can take buses everywhere. The convenience of transportation is self-evident. Moreover, these bus lines are connected to various railways. The total number of passengers carried daily is as high as 168,000, while the number of passengers on trains is only one-third of that.</p>
<h3>The Ford Car of the Long March by Lin</h3>
<p>Bearing Heavy Burdens and Achieving Distant Goals is Rare</p>
<p>The Dearborn Ford Motor Company has received reports from all over the world praising the excellent quality and outstanding performance of the new Ford cars. Recently, in the [Travel Competition] held by the De Vie Yuk Automobile Club in Kalia’s Skitte City, Ford cars won the first and fifth prizes. The other three prizes were won by non-American made cars. The route of this competition was unprecedented. The path used to be taken by riders, so both the drivers and the car bodies bore heavy burdens. The entire ground was rugged and uneven, with ponds and swamps, making it extremely uneven and difficult to drive. There were also stop signs at any time in the middle of the journey, unexpectedly causing the cars to stop. The cars participating in the competition had to brake at any time.</p>
<p>The winner of the first prize was the car driven by Paul Saxes, with the highest score of 1,097 points. The second prize was 1,079 points, the third prize was 1,054 points, the fourth prize was 1,048 points, and the fifth prize was also won by a Ford car with 1,045 points. Last autumn in July, in the Xinaru local area of Finland, Ford cars won prizes in six out of seven competitions. The competition site was near the Gulf of Bosnia. All types of cars participating in the competition were standard models. The only competition that the Ford drivers did not participate in was the fifth. During the second competition, the path was 10 kilometers long. The participants all maintained neat sports cars. The prize was won by a Ford car. This car had also participated in the first competition, only the windshield was removed and slightly changed.</p>
<p>Among the owners of Ford Model A cars, the long-distance travel report made by Li Honglangmei, a securities dealer from Brooklyn, New York, is the most interesting. Lang drove his sedan Ford car, starting from the city and heading to the West Coast. The speedometer on his car only had 90 miles, but before returning, this car had traveled as many as 8,709 miles. There were four passengers on board, weighing more than 680 pounds, and four large luggage boxes were loaded in the back of the car, not counting the miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>Langmei said in a letter, [We traveled 8,709 miles, passing through all the best and worst roads. But this car can cross any mountain and travel on any road. As for the changes in weather, there are not many problems for this car. We entered and exited the snow in Burk Mountain and the unbearably hot Mahahe River desert. When we reached the New Mexico border, it rained heavily, almost every night. The roads were washed away by the rain, but our car was still able to cross them. The only difference was that the mud overturned the car body, leaving a mud print in the engine. The car traveled through Yellowstone Park, Peach McToth, McLeabyss, Glerough Lake, Daka Rong, Cliff De Wheeler, Color Desert, Penderfet, Flayest, and major cities such as Old Mountain, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Portland, etc.]</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned 8,709-mile long-distance journey, there is also the long-distance automobile journey of engineer Maggen from Cape Town, Africa, and his wife. The entire route traveled was 7,500 miles. Mr. and Mrs. Maggen went deep into the interior of South Africa for as long as fourteen weeks. Mr. Maggen’s mode of transportation for this trip was a Ford truck. According to Mr. Maggen, the long march of thousands of miles was almost unpredictable. His wife was the only white woman who went deep into this dangerous place. The encounters and sights were bizarre and indescribable. The most difficult thing in the whole journey was the excessive heat, which was scorching and unbearable. The temperature rose to 125 degrees at sunrise and was still around 52 degrees at sunset. Fresh food would spoil in a short time. The only thing they could rely on to survive was canned food.</p>

<h3>Recent Conditions of Zhejiang Highways by Yang Xiufan</h3>
<p>My uncle works at the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau. Last year, I happened to go to Hangzhou for business and stayed at the bureau for several nights. As a result, I learned a lot about the recent conditions of the various lines under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Highway Bureau. I will now describe them below.</p>
<p>(1) Xiaoshao Section: This is one section of the Zhejiang-Fujian trunk line in the former Zhejiang Provincial Road Bureau's plan. It starts from Jiangbian Station on the south bank of the Qiantang River and ends at Wuyunmen in Shaoxing, connecting to the privately-run Shao Cao Sheng Automobile Road. The entire road is 90 li long. It passes through Xixing, Xiaoshan, Zhuanbatou, Yinlongzha, Yaqian, Qianqing, Qinwang, Ruanshe, Keqiao, Zunyiqiao, Xiguomen, Shaoxing, Changanmen, and other stations before reaching Wuyunmen. Each trip takes about two hours, and the fare is 1.2 yuan. There are a total of 30 round trips per day. There are also sectional buses between other stations, just like the regulations for trains. The total daily revenue of passenger tickets and luggage at all stations on the entire road averages more than 2,000 yuan. The average total number of passengers per day is more than 1,400. This road is an important route for travel between Hangzhou and Shaoxing. Travelers who choose to travel by land all take buses. Therefore, travelers rush to fill the stations, like a tidal wave. When the buses depart, they connect several vehicles, and there are no empty seats. Therefore, it is the most developed of all roads in the province.</p>
<p>(2) Gongsan Section: This is one section of the Hangshao Line. It was built in the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). It starts from Gongchen Bridge and ends at Sanlangmiao Station on the bank of the Qiantang River. It passes through Xiaohe, Guanyinqiao, Wulinmen, West Main Street, Hubin Road, Yongjinmen, Qingbomen, and Fengshanmen. The entire road is 24 li long. It imitates the public buses in Shanghai, and tickets are purchased on the bus. Buses depart three times per hour. The highest ticket price is 3.2 jiao, and the rest are in the range of a few fen. However, the average daily operating income is always more than 200 or 300 yuan. This road connects Ning, Shao, and Jinqu in the north, and connects to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway in the south. Therefore, there are many travelers coming and going. If the equipment is complete in the future, it can be operated safely.</p>
<p>(3) Yin Feng Line: This is part of the Zhejiang coastal line. In the future, it will connect to the Shao Cao Highway in the west to reach Hangzhou. It will cross Pingyang in the south and reach Fuding in Fujian Province, becoming the eastern thoroughfare between Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. The section from Ningbo to Xikou in Fenghua (the hometown of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek) is 61 li long. It started operating in June of this year. The road passes through Duntang, Shiqi, Lishe, Hengzhang, Qianwang, Jiangkou, Dabu, Qishan, and other places. The buses make a total of 16 round trips per day and take about one hour. The passenger ticket price is 8 jiao. The scenery along the entire road is quite good, and the business is fairly developed.</p>
<p>(4) Hangchang Road: This is part of the Ninghang National Highway. This road goes from Hangzhou, through Liangzhu, Pingyao, Wukang, Wuxing, and Changxing, and reaches the Father and Son Ridge on the border of Jiangsu Province. It is 245 li long in total. The currently operating sections are the Hangzhou to Moganshan section and the Hangzhou to Huzhou section. The Hangzhou to Moganshan section is 114 li long. It starts from the city station and passes through Hubin, Wulinmen, Xiaohe, Penggongling, Shangbai, Wukang, Sanqiaobu, and reaches Moganshan Station. The passenger ticket price is 1.23 yuan. The Hanghu section also starts from the city station, reaches Wukang, and passes through Daixi, Qingshan, and Shijiaqiao before reaching Huzhou. The entire journey is 170 li long, and the fare is 2.21 yuan. In the future, after the entire road is directly connected, the development of business prospects is immeasurable.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned roads are all highways that belong to the Provincial Highway Bureau and have already been opened to traffic. Other roads that have been completed and will be opened to traffic, as well as privately-run automobile roads, could not be mentioned. From this, it can already be seen that the Zhejiang provincial authorities have made rapid progress in road renovation and construction in recent years.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Records</p>
<h3>Overview of Road Administration in Gansu Province: Enlightenment and Non-Belief</h3>
<p>Gansu Province is remotely located in the Northwest, with overlapping mountains and ridges. The opening and management of roads is particularly crucial. Bordering Shaanxi and Shanxi to the east and Xinjiang and Mongolia to the north, traffic is frequent, and the transport of goods requires good transportation. If roads are not built, it is difficult to achieve results. An investigation reveals that there are eight major road lines which have been completed or are in the process of completion, all with Lanzhou in Gansu Province as the central hub. The function of these roads is divided into two types: motor vehicle roads and railways. About five thousand *li* of roads are already open to traffic. These are described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Lanzhou-Pingliang Line: From Lanzhou to Pingliang, and then to Changwu in Shaanxi, connecting with the Shaanxi motor vehicle road. The road has been completed and open to traffic for a long time. However, the gradients along the route are still not ideal and are being diligently reduced section by section. The bridges that have been completed are in the counties of Pingliang, Guyuan, Zhuanglang, Jingning, Dingxi, and Hening. In Gaolan, there are six large and small bridges, and in Qiao Zhong, there are nine large and small bridges. The main road has been completely constructed and leveled, and is inspected and repaired as necessary. The bridges are also under construction.</p>
<p>(2) Lanzhou-Ningxia Line: From Lanzhou to Ningxia Province and then to Dengkou. The old motor vehicle road route goes from Lanzhou through Changliushui in Jingyuan, crossing the Yellow River twice, avoiding the sand dunes, to Zhongwei and then to Dengkou. This has long been open to traffic. However, due to the obstruction of the sand dunes, traffic is inconvenient. The route has been changed to go through Jingyuan, Bieduzi, Shuiquan, Dahonggou, Baiquanzi, Sikouzi, Ninganpu, to Zhongwei. This section of the project is currently 84 *li* and has not yet been completed. The rest is constructed smoothly. As for bridges, in Jingyuan and Gaolan, the roads are flat and there is no need to build them. The main road has also been completely constructed and leveled.</p>
<p>(3) Lanzhou-Suzhou Line: From Lanzhou to Suzhou, and then to Yumen, connecting to Xinjiang. A branch line from Gaotai goes to Mao Mu in Inner Mongolia. The Anxi-Mao Xiu branch line goes to Dunhuang. The main motor vehicle road from Lanzhou to Suzhou and the branch line from Gaotai to Mao Mu in Inner Mongolia have been completed. The branch line from Anxi to Dunhuang is still under construction. The Lanzhou-Suzhou railway has been fully completed. Because this line has no major rivers, there are no major bridge projects.</p>
<p>(4) Lanzhou-Huangyuan Line: From Lanzhou to Qinghai Province. The motor vehicle road within Gansu has been completed but is being improved. The section within Qinghai Province is mostly stone road, and discussions are underway with the Qinghai provincial government to excavate it. As for the motor vehicle bridge on the Yellow River in Xincheng, Gaolan County, a pontoon bridge has been erected and a ferry is in operation. The railway has been completed and is in operation, but the section within Qinghai Province still needs to be organized.</p>
<p>(5) Lanzhou-Qinzhou Line: From Lanzhou to Tianshui, divided into east and west lines. The east line motor vehicle road runs parallel to the Lanzhou-Pingliang road to Tongwei and Huajialing, then diverges to Tianshui. This has now been completed, and the bridges have all been erected. The west line motor vehicle road goes from Didao through Longxi to Dashui. This line is mountainous and rugged, and excavation will take time. It is currently being surveyed. The main roads on both the east and west lines have been repaired and are now open to traffic.</p>
<p>(6) Lanzhou-Hezhou Line: From Lanzhou to Daohe, divided into east and west lines. The west line motor vehicle road goes from Gaolan Xixiang, through Lianhuacheng to Daohe. This line has been completed and open to traffic for a long time. The east line motor vehicle road shares the same route as the Lanzhou-Qinzhou west line to Didao, then diverges. It is currently being surveyed.</p>
<p>(7) Lanzhou-Xuyuan Line: From Lanzhou to Xuyuan, connecting to the Ningxia-Pingliang road. The motor vehicle road shares the same route as the Lanzhou-Ningxia road to Jingyuan and Bieduzi, then diverges, passing through Yanchi County, to Xuyuan. The entire road has been completed and open to traffic, but the Dalachi section in Jingyuan is being repaired.</p>
<p>(8) Ningxia-Pingliang Line: This line does not start from Lanzhou, but from Ningxia to Pingliang. The construction and opening of the motor vehicle road has been in place for a long time, and only requires occasional repairs. The bridges and the railway have all been completed and are open to traffic.</p>
<p>The above eight lines are the most recently constructed and opened roads in Gansu Province, which are beneficial for transportation and convenient for commerce. The benefits are not superficial. Even the people of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are more receptive to Han Chinese culture, which is also due to these several roads, allowing them to travel back and forth. The completed mileage of motor vehicle roads in Gansu Province are all dirt roads, with a width of 25 *chi*. The Lanzhou-Pingliang road from Lanzhou to Jingzhou Yaodian is 1200 *li* and has been open to traffic for a long time. The Lanzhou-Ningxia road from Lanzhou to Baiquanzi in Haiyuan is 627 *li* and is also open to traffic. The Lanzhou-Suzhou road from Lanzhou to Dingxin County is 1450 *li* and is open to traffic. The Lanzhou-Qinzhou road from Lanzhou to Qingshui is 720 *li* and is open to traffic. The Lanzhou-Huangyuan road from Lanzhou to the Pingfan border is 390 *li* and is not yet open to traffic. The Lanzhou-Xuyuan road from Lanzhou to Xuyuan is 770 *li* and is open to traffic. The Ningxia-Pingliang road from Zhongjie to Pingliang is 450 *li* and is open to traffic. The Lanzhou-Hezhou road from Lanzhou to Daohe is 300 *li* and is also open to traffic. Therefore, considering the mileage of the eight lines, the roads already open to traffic cover more than 5000 *li*.</p>
<h3>Motor Vehicle Transportation as a Source of National Wealth - Auspicious Person</h3>
<p>The United States has always been known as a prosperous and strong nation, with developed industry and commerce, and excellent products. People from all countries regard it as a land of wealth, and tens of thousands go there every year to do business. Recently, overseas commercial magnates and bankers have organized inspection teams to go to the United States to investigate the reality of industrial development, and to offer the results to their home countries to engage in the improvement of industry and commerce and revitalize industry.</p>
<p>Today, the governments of Europe, Australia, and the Far East are paying close attention to the automobile industry and its tax system in the United States. They have also selected commissioners to go to the United States to conduct inspections, with the aim of developing national roads and automobile transportation.</p>
<p>Officials who have inspected the United States and ladies who have traveled around the continent all say that the greatness of the American automobile industry is closely related to the country's wealth. The total amount of American investment in the automobile industry is 30 billion US dollars. The annual output value is about 50 billion US dollars or more. There are also 4 million men and women workers in various factories. The scale of the American automobile industry is rarely seen in the world. Americans have a considerable understanding of automobile transportation. The convenience of transportation is related to the prosperity or decline of the country, the progress of society, and the development of the economy, all of which are greatly affected. The current trend in North America is to expand national roads and connect the states, so that the people can share the benefits and everyone can own a car.</p>
<p>The development of automobile transportation has greatly facilitated commercial business. However, there will be a huge loss in railway revenue. Freight cars and buses are cheap and fast, convenient and comfortable, far better than trains. As a result, more and more people are using automobiles. Trains are lacking passengers. The railway is suffering from this unlimited competition, and business is becoming increasingly depressed. Tax revenue has been greatly reduced. As a result, several countries have risen up to find ways to rescue them. They ordered Congress to enact legislation to levy heavy taxes on the automobile industry to restore railway business, such as increasing the government's original tax rate.</p>
<p>The trend in the United States is different. Today's new and sensitive methods of transportation are warmly welcomed. Even railway companies use freight cars to carry goods for short distances. They also use buses to pick up and drop off passengers and load and unload luggage. The government does not issue laws to hinder it, but instead strives to promote and advocate it. Therefore, the breadth of American avenues, the number of vehicles, the convenience of transportation, and the prosperity of business are by no means comparable to other countries.</p>
<p>American road vehicle companies are indeed unable to compete with automobiles, but they are still working hard to maintain their business or switch to using automobiles. According to the results, the benefits of the automobile industry exceed the profits of other vehicle industries several times. This is the reason why the American automobile industry is so developed.</p>
<p>Today, the US federal government, in view of the need for roads, has distributed huge sums of money to the states to build and repair avenues. In addition, each state has a long-term road construction fee, which is drafted by the provincial government and then paid after being resolved by Congress.</p>
<p>Road construction policy is related to local security, industrial and commercial development, and many benefits. It can be compiled into a thick book. Take the farmers as an example. The roads are open, the transportation of goods is convenient, and the benefits are abundant. In terms of business, the value of land along the roads increases, and the profit from goods is ten times higher.</p>
<p>After the fact-finding missions and commissioners from various countries conducted on-the-spot investigations of the current situation of transportation in the United States, they concluded that the prosperity and strength of the United States is entirely dependent on the development of automobile transportation. When they return to their countries in the future to promote the automobile industry, they will surely make great contributions.</p>
<p>The initial concept of Americans regarded automobiles as consumables and luxury goods, which ordinary people could not afford. In recent years, people have deeply understood the benefits of automobiles and the economy of their use. Their attitude has changed dramatically. Everyone is buying cars. Therefore, the total number of vehicles in the United States today has reached more than five million.</p>
<p>The American automobile industry will surely be more revitalized in the future. With urban transformation and increased roads, the sales of automobiles will surely increase rapidly.</p>
<p>The General Motors Manufacturing Plant in the United States is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world. Its capital is 4 billion US dollars. It has 4 million workers. It has 24 branches in various countries. The output is large, the materials are beautiful, the parts are strong, and the sales are the widest. It can meet the needs of the global automobile industry.
