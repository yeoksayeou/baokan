<p>時評</p>
<h3>墨索里尼之演說</h3>
<p>意相墨索里尼之演說。世人評爲恍惚投一炸彈。將國際軍縮希望化爲烏有。其實未必然也。假使國際軍縮而果有希望。决不至因墨索里尼一人之故。而化爲烏有。更不至因墨索里尼一演說故。而化爲烏有。蓋意大利在今日。雖不弱。墨索里尼之棒喝黨在意國。雖甚有勢力。然欲與世界抗决無此理也假使國際軍縮之希望。而僅有其名。則表裏旣不相符。國際軍縮之希望。終有化爲烏有之日。雖不能因墨索里尼之演說。引起世界注意。轉成表裏如一之國際軍縮亦不過使化爲烏有之希望。由微而顯。由緩而速而已。故曰未必然也。至於意國之棒喝黨。謂能使棒喝主義廣被於全歐。則亦未必然。蓋一國有一國之情形。行於甲國而能成功者。未必不行於乙國而遭失敗。强不同者而使之同强不能行者而使之行。自來摹仿他人而不能受其益。反至受其害者不勝計。又何能以己所成就者。謂人亦必能成而望人摹仿之耶。故曰未必盡然也。</p>

<h3>袁順武脫險</h3>
<p>匪首詢袁家况時</p>
<p>以槍抵其太陽穴</p>
<p>經探警一塲努力</p>
<p>空屋救出活財神</p>
<p>勒贖四十萬元被困匪窟五日之大夏大學學生袁順武、已於昨晨五時、在楊樹浦路底救出、袁於上星期六晚六時半、在中山路被綁、匪方投函索價四十萬元、始得釋放、幸經六區公安局任區長督率徐·魏·兩巡官及劉偵緝員等、四出偵查、前後緝獲綁匪六人、將肉票平安救出、惟袁順武在匪窟時、看票之匪、均以財神及老爺子呼之、一旦財神破壁飛去、匪之不幸、亦云至矣、</p>
<p>空屋藏票　袁順武於二十四晚被綁後、經匪送往楊樹浦路底軍工路口之空屋内藏匿、此屋原係某麫粉廠、近來空閉已久、無人注意、故藏票其中、經過五日、始於昨晨五時、被六區公安警探前往被獲、初六區公安局將此案嫌疑之湖北人鄒耀東、在公共租界漢壁禮路一二一三號拘獲、帶回研訊、供出同鄕蕭建興、係此案同黨、因又將蕭及其妻俞氏緝獲、於是又連帶將房德文·易培漢·及劉長明·等三匪、次第拘案、劉匪即供出楊樹浦藏票之地點者也、</p>
<p>救出財神　昨晨五時、六區警探帶同眼線、馳往楊樹浦路底軍工路口之藏票地點、其時天尙未明、天雨迷濛、暗中隱約見有洋式房屋一座、各探員等即出電炬照耀、直趨其屋、破門而入、𨶑無一人、因先搜尋靠門各屋、毫無所獲、乃又穿過兩條狹弄、始見一連房屋、門均關閉、在最僻暗之處、高呼袁名、始闻應聲、因破扉入、則見肉票袁順武偃臥床上、看守之匪、已逃逸無踪、祇餘手槍三支而已、此時袁上身穿襯衫、下着西裝褲、精神尙佳、袁稱看守之匪共有四人、日夜不離其身、呼伊爲財神及老爺、飲食茶水、招待週到、即欲看書、亦代爲購置也、所難堪者、當匪首詢其家况時、則匪手持槍兩支、槍口直抵其左右太陽穴、不覺心悸神亂耳、</p>
<p>破案經過　袁順武被綁後、匪投函至大夏大學前後有三次之多、勒欵四十萬元、命其家屬往贖、經最後一次接信時、六區公安局已將鄒耀東·蕭建興·等拘獲、進行頗爲順利、至二十八日、偵悉同黨房德文等匿居公共租界六馬路統一旅館三十八號房間、六區公安局任區長因督令徐濤魏潔忱兩巡官及偵緝隊·領班劉少卿等、於下午四時前往、在别一室内守候、至晚十一時半、綁匪房德文返統一旅館、經誘往警探所居之房間内談話、房見機不佳、出洋一百五十元行賄、警探等虛與委蛇、出其不意、將房拘獲、嚴加審訊、供出肉票所在之地點、惟同黨劉長明知之、因又馳往北浙江路寗安坊、將劉拘獲、</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>妻（夜半從牀上坐起來。）！親愛的。你聴得麽。樓下有賊。</p>
<p>夫—没有没有。你好好的睡吧。</p>
<p>妻—你聽着。我知道樓下一定有賊。</p>
<p>夫—我知道樓下一定没有賊。</p>
<p>妻—你自己睏错了。樓下一定有賊。</p>
<p>賊（在後房發聲）—太太。你丈夫的話不錯。我們都在樓上。</p>
<p>甲（在一家做壽人家的門首看熱鬧）！那位壽母究竟有多少年紀了。看伊還是健旺得很。</p>
<p>乙—你不見那壽幛上的金字麽。明明是九秩大慶。那位太太已九十歲了。</p>
<p>甲—你旁邊看那個骨廋如柴的老頭兒。又是伊的甚麽人。</p>
<p>乙—是伊的丈夫今年也有八十八歳了。</p>
<p>甲—但他爲甚麽悉眉苦眼的。一臉子的不高興。</p>
<p>乙—因爲他給夫人連付了四十年的壽險費。還須付下去。實在怨極了。</p>

<h3>海外片鴻</h3>
<p>— 老鳳</p>
<p>一别繁華似海的巴黎。已七易寒暑。廻思曩游。彷彿如向斑駁古碣上榻摹字跡。眞依稀極矣。昔張江陵有言。吾神遊九塞。一日二三。每思此言。低徊不置。昔日同學先後連翩歸國。冠蓋滿京華。宣勞黨國。獨吾至友陳君其人者。仍邁進不已。謂非奇特之人歟。落月屋梁。正思顏色。故人情厚。尺素魚竟從海外傳來。摘錄數端。藉資譚助。非敢以興奮激剌之文字。干我讀者。</p>
<p>十個外交家趕不上國際上光榮原是讓外交家來趕的。但如果國内出了一個世界有名的電影家或運動家。也許爲己國爭到相當的面子。或者所得到的反比外交家大過數倍。謂余不信。請看日美比賽一節。原來某次日本網球選手在海外同美國人比賽。所爭的是世界上第一的紀錄。自然轟動了素來注重運動的法國民衆。比賽時評判員看錯了。多給了日本一分。日本選手隨即故意輸去一分。以示狠不願領受因僥倖而得到的分數。在塲的羣衆。自然一致贊歎日本人之道德高尙爲不可及。次晨各報排着大字。加以譽揚。結語還說一個運動家在國際間所爭的光榮。十個外交家還趕不上他。</p>
<p>法國老太太發極誓　某日有一位法國太太過我（陳君自稱）寓。問起一位中國同學的住址。伊的顏色逈不如向日的和易近人。我很爲訝異。乘間問伊有什麽事情。伊怒冲冲地對我說明原委。才知這位同學住在伊家多時。但是書也不念。工也不做。天天忙着交際異族異性的朋友。跳舞哩。大菜哩。忙得不亦樂乎。有時官費接濟不着。缺少用途。還向伊通融一點欵子。因此積累了數千法郎。後來託故揚長他去。雖逢年遇節。尙以一賀片相酬答。可是寫着的地址。盡是僞託的。伊不明其虛僞。按着地址前去找他。還不是鴻飛冥冥撲一個空嗎。我當時曉得了這段故事。羞得無地自容。可巧過了幾天。别有一位同學要找房子。走到伊的家去。伊狠堅决的說“Ｚ”en＇ai　rien　a　faire　avec　lesChinisi（意以爲永不要同中國人接近）這位同學抺了一鼻子灰。還是莫明其妙。這種事情。在國内算不來一會子事。但在外國就不是個人的問題。乃是全體的問題。所以我在海外眞如虎尾春冰。時加警惕。雖則國際光榮。斷難望因我一人而增高。但極不敢妄自菲薄。貽全民族羞啊。</p>
<h3>紙衾</h3>
<p>— 墨痴</p>
<p>自由談前載某君冬日無被乃厚糊新聞紙成襲。夜間蜷臥其中以爲常。人以爲奇而悲其遇。不知此正古人所云之紙衾也。予讀張孝祥于湖集有送紙衾與韓仲父二詩。其一云。韓郎香盡諸緣絶。壞衲篝燈供佛熏。乞與紙衾綿樣暖。撩敎醉裏夢紛紜。其二云。了知夢境皆虛妄。妄念常從夢處開。敗子道心因此夢。夢成還我紙衾來。則所謂紙衾者。不知以何紙成之。何其温柔乃爾。且撩夢而敗人道心也。世之博雅君子。其有以敎我。</p>

<p>測字亦作拆字。又作破字。又作相字。爲占法之一種。任舉一字。以其偏旁點畫。離合參互。或觸機附會。以判人事之吉凶。指明心法有云。唐斐晉公征吴元濟。掘地得石。文曰。雞未肥。酒未熟。相字者解曰。雞未肥。無肉也。爲已。酒未熟。無水也。爲酉。破賊在己酉。果然。此相字之所目昉。又隋書經籍志。有破字要訣一卷。顏氏家訓謂即今之拆字。此則破字拆字之權輿。逮宋則有謝石。以拆字擅名蓋由來久矣。惟測字未遑深考。若今之設攤道左。假以爲餬口之資者。吾未見其能得觸機附會之神。特信口雌黄耳。頃在某旅社得聽諸友暢談異事。爲之忘倦。所譚皆足資記載。爰先述測字之一節。曰。有某君者。在某邑設館。頗著盛名。傾動一城。邑令獨不信。且心惡之。欲加以斥逐。而鑒於平日與邑之縉紳往還。胥盛譽其人。恐招反響乃微服至某君館。面試其術隨手就盤中拈得一「人」字。曰。請測我爲何等人。某君不假思索。曰。君一手拈得人字。合之爲「大。」做官人也。邑令默然。擲資如例而去。復令其僕盛服往就僕之掌中書一人字。亦請測其爲何等人。某君曰。幸毋見怪。君乃人之手下人。僕也。僕返以告邑令。始驚其神。然猶以爲偶中。更於獄中提出一犯。整容一新。乘軒至館。敎以口述一人字。請測爲何等人。犯如言。且故作傲岸狀。若爲闊老也者。某君仍不假思索。曰。君囚也。口中一人字。非囚而何。犯爲之氣沮。邑令聞之。遂敬信無疑。此猶之吾邑喬公鶴僑故事。喬公知吾邑。不信鬼神。聞某處乩壇甚靈。欲斥之。恐地方人士不服。乃於夜間屏退左右。親草十問。皆爲人所不能答者。翌晨就壇前焚之。請乩仙判答。孰意乩筆走沙。俄頃竟一一答出。末復附一詩。道出喬公隱事。喬公始大驚服。駭汗莫名。此後敬奉乩壇。較他人爲尤虔。至今喬公十問答猶有刊本行世也。與某邑令測字事。洵乎可曰。將毋同。</p>
<h3>特殊的祈禱</h3>
<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>我國社會中有許多迷信行爲。特殊的祈禱就是其中的一種。說起來十分有趣味。茲請本報讀者試看以下各條。</p>
<p>（三）以破壞爲祈禱　這是說以破壞的行爲。爲祈禱的手續。鄕下人朝禮杭州三竺諸佛地的時候。他們經過蘇小小的墳墓。常是拾了磚頭石子向墓亭上丢去。說這樣的行爲是祈禱蠶花茂盛（就是育蠶獲利之意）的一法。</p>
<p>（二）以戲押爲祈　就是前面这批人吧。他們朝禮到岳王墳前。常是撫着鐵鑄的秦王氏的乳部說。今年我們蠶花二十四成了。（二十四成爲祈蠶通詰）。</p>
<p>（三）以溺辱祈禱　也是這批人。他們於撫弄秦王氏的乳部之外。還要拉開袴子向秦檜等鐵象上大澆其回魂湯。也說是會使蠶花好的。</p>
<p>（四）以求乞爲祈禱　小孩子患了瘧症。他的家長便要向竈神獻殷勤。不過方式和平時的齋竈有些不同。當時用的一鍾茶。是向七户人家乞化得來的茶葉泡的。也有向七家乞米。或乞飯的。也有化了七家的錢去買齋竈的用品的。</p>
<p>（五）以偷竊爲祈禱　浙江吴興縣鄕間的風俗。「中秋人靜後。競出偷取飯瓜。得者以爲得子之兆。」（見湖州府志）是連做賊也變作祈禱了。</p>
<p>（六）以誦讀爲祈禱　在小便地方的牆上。常有這樣的紅紙字條。「天皇皇。地皇皇。我家有個夜啼郎。仁人君子念一遍。一忽睏到大天光。」這又是以誦讀爲祈禱了</p>
<h3>南洋游記（六七）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>八月三日同李震中莊海泉楊鎭赴眉描。Maymyo由瓦城東北行。凡四十八英里。四人乘汽車。價八元。沿途高路。兩旁大樹。小林蔽天。時見牛成羣。特無美角牛如檳城者矣。每里有標石記里數。眉描者。乃一極大之山坡名也。行二十英里以上。漸上坡。極曲折。似廣西南寗之汽車路。但於斷崖處有石墻或木椿或鐵絲綑以遮之。免行車危險。此爲最善法也。下視瓦城。如天空俯瞰。云高凡六七百尺矣。剛至半途。山最高處即二十四英里。有小停車處。流泉激石。乃濯足其中。頓覺清凉。此爲南洋極　地也。英總督中國領事均常來避暑。更前行下坡。途有紅黄白紫各花及果木。聞有日本人於此種葡萄。每年可得利數千盾。漸見茅舍竹籬榖菜。緬人種田於此。生活極簡。聞此地之妙水泉極佳。不僅清凉而已。時見清流涓涓。俄而見紅房掩映。乃到眉描市。此小市塲清新勝於仰光。但華人不過一百。有中華會館。叩門只一老人守之。語不可通。有達英學校牌。亦無學生。云散去矣。余等住於梁金山别墅。其妻舅尹君守宅。尹父粵人。而母緬人也操英語頗流利。問緬王事。云緬王於前四十九年（一八八五）被俘。至印度而死矣。問王宮何以荒凉至此。日本來房甚多。今均坍倒耳。問王族有何人。日只有三女。一嫁印人。二嫁緬人。安能謀其他乎。余問王女名。答不知。問北緬土產。答吾緬極富之地。紅玉出於納各。黄玉出於虎坎。綠玉出於馬庚。但吾不知其采法耳。華人致富者則甚多也。此小市無英緬中華文各報紙。蓋鄕市耳。有雲南人旅店飯舖。住且食兩頓。每日不過一盾。菜均肉鷄。可謂賤矣。不住而食價亦同等。每餐半盾。蓋住無費也。菜飯味極佳。雲南與四川同味。均有名之中華菜也。日間在一小樓。與尹君談。不覺窗開風冷。不能耐。乃請　閉窗。且身穿長夾衣。此乃半年以來在南洋所無。忽而覺冷矣。蓋新嘉坡在零度下。逾瓦城以北已到北緯二十三度一而至温帶與汕頭廣州柳州同線。東西相望。近雲南界也。此地冬季或須棉衣。平時不冲凉亦可。余半年苦熱。至此乃入南洋之佛清凉地。歡喜無景。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三○四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　四廂彈淚惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>看看打得差不多了。房間裏凡是眼睛所看得到的。已經没有什麽完善的東西。連牀上的被兒枕兒。也傾倒了幾面盆水。小妹嚇得躱到了小房子裏去。只是索索地亂抖。殷太太這時也鳴金收軍了。臨行還指着蓮香道。今天且饒了你。等老爺回來了以後。給你總算賬。說完了這話。伊便率領了一班帶來的娘子軍和參謀長先鋒隊。便自去了。待殷太太走了以後。蓮香看看房間裏的破碎殘敗情狀。眞是傷心。好比大兵過處。全城爲墟。所有房裏的鏡臺。全行打破。碎磁滿地。都是很大的價目買來的。幸虧箱子裏的衣服。櫃子裏的首飾。還没有動。蓮香早已哭得似淚人一般。小妹好似現在有守士之責的地方官一般。到了敵兵法了以後。又回到伊的老地方來了。伊却極力的來慰勸蓮香。伊說儘哭也没有用。我們也得把善後事宜辦一辦。把地方收拾出來。所有碎磁破片。一概都留在那裏。不要抛棄。等老爺回來。給他過目。也是我們一輩子的憑據。打壞的東西。怕他不賠償。打壞了舊的。我們可以另换新的。倒是牀上弄得這樣一塌糊塗。怎麽好呢。晚上弄得這樣濕搭搭的。怎麽好睡呢。快開箱子。拿出一牀乾凈的被褥來。那濕的被褥。交給我去拆洗了吧。蓮香至此。也没有辦法。只好委屈一點。等待老爺回來了再說。及至老爺回來了以後。家裏是大鬧一塲。姨太太這一方面。也惟有把那天所受的委屈。哭訴給老爺聽。這時那位殷老爺。幾乎把頭都軋扁了。殷太太的意思。當然是不許老爺再到那一方面去。那種濫污貨。應該　伊出去。可是　伊出去。殷老爺又如何捨得。只得另换一個地方。在家裏。只說那個小公館已經取消了。其實另築了秘密香巢。上一次都害在馬車夫根生的身上。根生也知道此番的飯碗頭是打掉了。只好辭去了生意。别尋户頭。那位殷老爺。爲了恐怕洩漏秘密的緣故。馬車也不坐。每天出去。隨時雇了一輛黄包車。一個人溜到秘密香巢裏去。以爲萬無一失的了。那知他有這位參謀長而兼營偵緝隊長的大少爺。奉了他總司令殷太太的令。釘他老子的稍。又被他釘着了。翠筠講到那裏時。樓下又來僱堂唱了。左詩晨道。簡單點。快些講完了吧。</p>

<h3>棉市步趨上展</h3>
<p>穩局恐難持久　一週來棉市以美棉繼續回漲亦由虛疲之境而轉向隱定、與低峯相差二兩餘不可非劇烈之變化也、查美棉因生產迭次增加、消費依然不振、市勢步趨下游、而見十年來之新低價、近乃以政府之積極的宣傳囤積、由一角而回漲至一角二分、且其漲勢似屬未衰、蓋價格基礎已低、漲風亦較勁、回憶三四月間以合作社吸收五月期及七月期而回漲幾三百磅音、結果仍因生產與消費之關係繼續下落、此次情形殆與上次相似、亦有拉起二百餘磅音之力、惟十月八日第三次政府估計發表後、天氣良好之消息時傳、而第一次之濃霜已過、據報告未有重大損傷、更觀第六次軋棉報告爲九百二十五萬二千包、與一九二五年大豐收數字相近、由此可見新棉情形依然良好、下次（十一月八日）政府估計有繼續增加、能達一千四百五十萬包之可能消息、狀况能否與供給相追隨、實爲棉市趨勢大關鍵、更據萬國紡織總聯合會發表之世界原棉銷費狀况、美棉之支配世界棉市之權力、漸露動搖之象、（關於此事記者當另言之、茲不贅）迴顧環境、棉市之趨向、仍少積極的樂觀、就記者測之、暫時因各方人爲的維持或得站平穩的局面而盤旋、以待下次政府估計爲進退也、中棉以各地生產不豐、到貨未湧亦隨美棉而上升、然外棉繼續的侵略、將來新棉上市湧旺之時、恐仍不免再有一度之破裂也、况紗市之前途趨勢之悲觀、當然不無相當之關係、故就大勢所測棉花市况穩定局面、恐亦不過暫時之情形也、</p>

<h3>糧食　陰雨連綿米市步漲</h3>
<p>閘北　昨日各帮到源不旺、仍祗二三十號、各　走銷甚爽、新粳特頂開十四元七角、市高見緊兩角、開出十四元四角、雙方交易尙可、而中關以下悉因天雨人心關係步提角半、但雨絲連綿、河斛不易多開耳、羊尖到稀銷暢、步升三角、高開十一元半、買氣極濃、此貨即如天晴、亦難回下、杜尖埠秈悉漲兩角、趨勢因乏客帮問津、故無羊秈之俏俐、客尖成本仍鉅、貨客大都尙須虧耗故頗扳售、喊起兩角許、特頂須十元○五六角白元到微銷定、稍堅角左、</p>
<p>滬南　昨日河到二十餘號、本街去化不甚開展、常錫新粳無上落仍盤旋於十四元關左、蘇同白粳祇有少數零　問津人心因之平淡、大盤與上日相同、南路青角窰種一時新等白稻開高十三元左右、而練塘泗涇等百哥因價在低廉地位銷路尙不寂寞高開十二元四角以上、約升近角而已、羊秈街銷平平、杜尖到銷兩淡、以上行情均無升降、變元異常凋零、陰元稍有見抵、各價殊乏榮辱</p>
<h3>客秈可望站住</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不多、存底亦薄、市面似有轉機之可能、惟客化不旺、本街鄉莊更無去路、市面乃得扯平、統市由福州帮辦去江西機早三百包、價十元零七角半至四角半、又本街等辦去南京糙米二小車、價八元二角至八元、糙米有廠家需要、市面乃比機砶貨較佳云、</p>
<h3>粉市近遠同俏</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、各月份均亦步步見俏、本月份因交割已近空頭急於抵進、最高時雖到過二兩二錢九分二厘半、十一月份至二兩三錢遠期亦同時帶緊、至最近趨勢、本月份已無問題、恐一至十一月份、各小廠洋麥如到頭不多、則所空籌碼、或將被軋、而客帮去胃、近亦活動、近遠期均有買進、故前途暫看好象也、結果本月份較前日好七厘半、十一·十二月份好一分二厘半、正月份好一分半、二月份好一分、三月份好一分半云、</p>
<h3>期麥抵空重抬</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、人心又見良好、因洋麥之報價已好三四五角不等、且十月份之標準交割、一批貨品、已爲廠家收去、則此後之籌碼在目下當須暫時減少、因此業外空頭、抵捕頗切、遠期亦以此故人心帶緊各月份之交易亦復趨暢盛、結果十一月份較前日漲三分、十二月份漲三份、正月份漲五分、二月份漲四分、三月份漲四分、現麥因廠胃仍佳、各檔又喊高七八分不等、開山東·瑤灣·信掦州·高郵麥·江北麥、清江浦麥共七千餘包由阜豐·信大等辦去云、</p>
<h3>標期豆步跌</h3>
<p>昨日標準各期豆市初極平疲、緣承上日之餘風、各方陸續出售、故上午開盤均小四五分、迨至下市開盤、油廠帮　有落手、兼之金市向榮情况漸定嗣後大連電報到申微堅、内地帮因乃停出、各價遂告稍上、結果十二月期四兩五錢八分、一月期五錢七分、均小二分、二月期四兩六錢一分、三月期六錢半、以上均無上落、</p>
<h3>糖市　日糖廠盤又開五萬包</h3>
<p>市場劃盤均見轉升</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一四六八七五、比前電回跌三一二五紐約期糖十二月份一·四四、比跌五分、明年三月份一·五二、亦跌六分、五月份一·五七、九月份一·七○、各跌七分、爪哇現糖價八·一二五、期糖十一月及十二月份價均八盾、比前仍乏升降、公會市場劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白以廠家特訊漲價半盾、人氣轉强、出户絶跡、而買方尙有進取、價至七兩八錢、最高貨價且至七兩九錢、雖交易依然寥落、市形因之甚挺、二十號中砂白六兩八錢、八號荷赤六兩三錢半、市則較平、日糖市亦轉升、明華ＹＲＯ嘜七兩三錢半、ＹＴ嘜七兩六錢半、ＴＫ嘜七兩七錢半、均升五分ＹＰ嘜七兩八錢半至七兩九錢則比升一錢、市象尙見活潑、廠盤明華糖售開三萬包價日金五元八角、明治糖二萬包、價四元六角、期均十二月及明年正月份交貨、行方進怠頗濃、已全數售通、且有供不應求之概、比之前盤已漲一角而市且俏秀也、號盤有炳昌號售開現貨二十號中砂白三千零十二袋價元六兩八錢、又該號售出下月二號到貨八號荷赤二千袋、價元六兩三錢半、要需頗盛、市象頗爲堅挺云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　桃肉市面平定</h3>
<p>桃肉近日陸續有到查市上行存尙屬不多、津漢兩處辦價據函訊無甚上落、此間銷路如本街及嘉湖常錫等帮時有採購、趨勢平定、昨市上　津桃肉呌售四十兩、次之三十八兩、堰桃肉三十四兩至三十五兩、</p>
<h3>海味　魷魚產地報漲二元</h3>
<p>魷魚據查函館對州兩處因洋生冬水不發、到貨較秋水更缺、故產市漲起二元、而滬方客銷、雖未旺動、但辦本旣高號盤扳緊、所以價不跟漲、昨開全清大片廂館秋水貨價四十四兩七錢、匀片統貨四十三兩一錢、至四十二兩六錢、冬水潮貨四十二兩二錢、夾油片四十兩零三錢、全油片三十八兩、雨霖片三十五兩五錢、共計售出一百三十九件、聞號家尙有留剩一百餘件、暫不顧售、待看此後產市變化如何、再定去留云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約廠經電轉價激漲</h3>
<p>廠方仍以絲本不敷談判尙難就範</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、忽趨漲勢、查紐約各絲織廠鑒於中日廠絲價已跌至最低限度、乘機抛購春季原料、加以　匯緊張、絲價因之激漲、昨怡和行接得紐約電告、滬白廠　已漲三四十兩、各廠商仍以絲本不敷、堅持續漲方售成交有待云</p>
<h3>馬賽長吐價激漲</h3>
<p>絲織廠動辦春季原料價漲二三法郎</p>
<p>本埠絲廠長吐、市面自江浙絲廠公議全體停業後、絲產日减、頓趨堅漲、日昨法莊接得馬賽電告、各絲織廠鑒於中日絲廠停工、來源漸减、分起抛購、春季原料存底稀薄、市價激漲、現市優等上海絲廠長吐每基羅價開八十五法郎、計漲二三法郎、</p>
<h3>高莊珍眉歐銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日　源·屯溪等路之珍眉綠茶、協和·怡和·永興·天祥等行、續有進胃、交易不寂、屯溪抽芯貨、頂盤開二百兩、普通珍眉頂盤開一百三十二兩蝦目珠茶、怡和·杜德等行均略有需要、惟認價極低、貢熙綠茶及祁門紅茶、協助會仍有提高抑低之意、中低莊貨、去路依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油銷滯狂跌</h3>
<p>連日白桐油跌風之猛、得未曾有、洋莊批盤由二十六兩跌至十五兩六錢、較之十六年份之四十六兩高峯、相差達三十兩之鉅、即照平日市價亦跌倍數有餘、浙省桐油、亦隨跌七元足度、僅售二十七元、夷考致跌之由、純因洋銷清懈、存油山積、雖貨主一再貶價、但成交難暢、當此產市出湧洋銷停滯之秋、恐大跌之下、尙有跌風也</p>
<h3>五金　秋雨影響五金裝貨</h3>
<p>昨日秋雨霏霏、出口帮對於五金裝貨莫不裏足不前、蓋防五金品之侵遭水漬、影響售盤也、因是市場開出之貨、益覺寥落、雖繁銷各舊鐵品等昨日買賣亦異常鮮少、惟行情喝價、則因先令關係、故多提高者、雖瀉風甚盛之青鉛條等、昨日亦高起一錢售十四兩四錢半、二百磅會司鐵漲二錢半、售二十一兩七錢半、昨如製罐廠辦去六七百箱、聞市貨甚尠、後市看好、白鐵類開出有限、幸市無變遷、釘類買者仍寡、故市風依然難振云、</p>
<h3>紹帮辦點錫五百担</h3>
<p>點錫市面久已冷落、故市塲中亦許久未有大宗買賣、前紹興帮福號冷盛諸號辦去現貨五百條塲中買氣一時大盛、雖行情不見進步但比之先前已覺挺秀多多矣、</p>

<h3>逃生回來！壓驚</h3>
<p>— 椿</p>
<p>因爲德第的懇切的誠意、使我無法推辭、於是在這銀漾的月夜、就趕着上吴淞、</p>
<p>本來預備的是去看日出、吴淞看日出可以說是一個非常適宜的地方、事先曾有人告訴我們、當那朝曦上升的時候、一忽而升些一忽兒降些地必十多次那詩意的情况是很難描寫的、所以我也欣然的爲這朝曦的畫景所掀動了、但在第二天我醒來的時候很强的日光却早已從玻璃窗直封了進來、不覺失望、待披衣到窗前向海面望去、則血紅的火球離開海面足有二十來丈高了、這使我們預定的計劃宣告失敗、後來德弟起身、他才告我、原來他在四點鐘東方未白的時候已起來過一次、因了秋風括的太大、怕我受凍、便没有呌醒我、而重又假眼去的、呵、德弟的深情眞也夠令我感激呵、</p>
<p>然而玩畢竟要玩的、我們玩的興緻、依然是那樣濃呢、早餐後、料理了一些雜務、便商量探燈塔去了、</p>
<p>秋風括的確是起勁、迎面送來、不時使我倒抽一口氣、那自然界凋零的氣象、枯萎的色調、不禁冲襲我們的思想、更不由得心寒忡怔、哦、這深秋之嚴肅多麽感傷人們的心呵、我們一路沿着黄浦江邊走、塵沙飛揚得兇、如有汽車一類的車輪馳過、簡直非站住側身躱避不可、我們手携手兒地、談笑看、不覺已近江岸了</p>
<p>太陽的光線映在水面上、散發出色彩的光澤、望前去、一面是長江、一百是東海、中間隱約地露出水面的是崇明島、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>向長江的對岸望去、則白濤一片和水天分隔的一縫線而已、朝東海、自三夾水以外更是同樣的一片白茫茫、所點綴着祗有船隻、此外、便是水天呼應的所謂相映成趣了、我們不知是所然的還是悵然的遙望了一會、便循道下去、趕上燈塔去的路、</p>
<p>燈塔離岸約有三十多丈遠、用山石和三合土凝成的大方石雜亂地堆成一條路、把燈塔和岸相連了起來的、我們跨着大步走去、有時是聳着肩、但很閒散地時常休息、或遙顧、或談笑、委實忘去那所謂生命的疲勞、而任情盡我們的豪興、</p>
<p>—要儘讓海風吹拂我們的胸襟、把所有積壓的鬰結來完全給吹散掉、使我們肺腑如受凈露的清洗一樣、這是多麽有意思的、呵、柔和的海風、這樣爽然的吹、吹吧、我們沐浴着、沐浴在你的懷中、</p>
<p>我不禁伸張着手、當着徐扇的海風、向德弟說了、</p>
<p>—是的、德弟也同情地說、這眞是夠人消受吧、如果每天能夠的話、才眞幸福呵、</p>
<p>我們不知不覺儘向前走着、不多時燈塔已顯得很清楚了、燈塔是不能上去的、離開堤岸還有丈多遠、我們看見目的地快要到了、自然無限的欣喜、但突然有一種聲音來警告、使我們不由吃驚呆立着起來、</p>
<p>—你們快回去吧、潮已漲得很兇了、</p>
<p>於是我們細細辨别這聲音是從何發出來的原來那泊在燈塔旁的一隻小舢板的船伙在揮手警告我們、這樣、就立刻使我們注意到潮水了、只見長江上流的在汹湧地推下來、比先前已漲高得很多了、但我們仍然從容的細細觀察了燈塔的構造和形式、雖然心裏已在起着急、</p>
<p>我們回來差不多都是聳跑着、然而、已來不了、我們才跑了五六丈遠、在較低處的石已浸在水裏、把路阻斷、這時浪澎湃、激着石、濺出浪花、鞋便給沾濕了、在初、我們還不怕濕、設法在高石上跨過、但不到十來步、前面的石差不多都浸在水裏了、祇多露出角、而潮浪更冲急地波動、使我們不由害怕、就站定、高出水面尺許的石上、實際、我們確是不懂水汛、我還以爲不久潮就會退、而且不至再漲高了、</p>
<p>—我們就在這裏站住、我說、現在旣不能走了、那末祗能待他潮回去、我想、也至多一二小時吧、反正也好的、就在這裏觀潮哩、</p>
<h3>運動家</h3>
<p>— 華攝</p>
<p>我這時反而樂觀起來了、我不知道危險竟是在目前、</p>
<p>—眞的、我們今天在這裏大可以望江興嘆了、德弟也附和着、</p>
<p>但潮水儘自長着、我們所立的石也不穩了、給浪水冲洗過數回、這漸漸使我焦灼起來、想到如果再漲時將怎樣、可是這時、不却又不能用話來安慰德弟呵、</p>
<p>—我們兩人站在一起總不要緊的吧、即使水再漲、而且總不至漲得怎樣高、</p>
<p>—就是不好的話—、我們到也死在一起哩、</p>
<p>德弟這樣微笑着概然的說、我聽了、不覺心波動、險些兒流出淚來、我們的手不自禁地愈握緊了、</p>
<p>沈默加進了我們的中間、我們像各自默契着一般、我開始注意到回去的路、祗有少數的石露角出水面、而我們的周圍、幾是完全成了水的世界喲、我們似乎飄然的、做着踏水戲、又像水面上的浮萍、將要隨風逐浪、</p>
<p>情形一點點地緊張起來、我們看形勢不對、便决定要船來渡、我們看見有輪船馳過、就呼喊着、但是打趣地、船上的人看見了也只以爲是尋趣、並没有放下什麽救生船來、而我們的脚下却快將没爲澤國了、於是看再不能下去了、就向前面的泊在燈塔旁的舢板揮手、表示要他們救援的意思、果然、他們撑起蓬行來了、我們不覺相對狂笑了一會、企感此游的滑稽、等船泊近來、我們便一躍上去、那船老大外常地和靄、他看見我們狼狽的情形、温言地安慰我們、並且問道、</p>
<p>—你們是從那裏來的、</p>
<p>—就在吴淞、</p>
<p>—是水產學校嗎、</p>
<p>—不是、</p>
<p>呵…所以你們不懂潮汛了、這眞是危險、這幾天正是大汛、潮水每半點鐘漲一尺要漲至你們没才止、</p>
<p>—那未機點鐘可退了、</p>
<p>—至少五點鐘、下次如果你們不知道潮汛的話、切勿來、船伙很誠意的　告我們說、</p>
<p>我回頭向德第笑着說、</p>
<p>—今天眞是不幸中之大幸吧、</p>
<p>這樣談着、船已靠岸了、我們給了他們一些酒資、就逃上岸、心房的血液還跳得緊、我們相安慰了一番、便席地坐下、把鞋和襪脫下來去曬了、</p>
<p>當我們回頭看上燈塔去的路時、水已結成一片了、於是晞嘘了一陣、祝福地、</p>
<p>回地吴淞、太陽已離開正中的地位、我們上館子去各沽了一斤酒、</p>
<p>—我們且破例多喝些、這是我們的壓驚酒呵、</p>

<h3>最近的西班牙文壇</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>每月最佳書會</p>
<p>密洛之逝世</p>
<p>英美這幾年很流行的讀書會已經流行到西班牙了、馬德里（Madrid）現在也有了這麽樣的一個機關、名呌「每月最佳書會」（Asociacion　del　Major　Libro　del　Mes）、但、所不同者、這個讀書會並不是一種變相的出版機關、而是西班牙文壇上的一個重要團體、因爲它的主持人都是現代西班牙底文學巨子、他們的選擇和批判當然是足以引起全國底重視、而含着嚴重的意味的、所以作家底新作如果被選、是於作者本人底身價地位極有裨益的、主辦這個讀書會底重要人物如下、阿左林（Azorin）、開奈多（E·DiazCanodo）、羅特立蓋（Pedro　Saing　Rodriguez）、特阿耶拿（Ramon　Perezz　de　Ayak）、貝刹（Ricardo　Baeza）、蕯拉凡列亞Ｊose　M·　Salaverria）、阿耳塔迷亞（Rafael　altamia）和密洛（Gabrel　Mirs）這些都是現代西班牙文壇的重要的人物、其中密洛新近已經逝世、而密洛之逝世是使西班牙的文學界大爲震驚惋惜的、</p>
<h3>茄賽民族主義的作家</h3>
<p>渴望西班牙民族的再興</p>
<p>茄賽（Jose　Ortega　J.Gasset）底「旁觀者」（Ｅl　Espeotador）底第七卷新近已經出版、是被這個讀書會所選的新書之一、這是一部隨筆論文集、題目的性質很不一律、從「黑智兒與美國」到「南美大平原」、都有得談到、茄賽對於德國哲學是很有研究的、他說「黑智兒是思想界之皇、學者之冠軍」、然而他承認黑智兒底短處是在於不能解釋形成中之歷史、他對於美國底將來、是不理解的、這是茄賽在他那篇「黑智兒與美國」裏所討論的、而且茄賽說黑智兒底大著「歷史的哲學」在法國和西班牙至今還没有譯本、實在是這兩國學術界出版界之恥、所以他宣佈說不久要將這部書譯成西班牙文、此外、在「愛司旦多之興起」（Origen　Deprortivo　del　Estado）那篇論文裏、他追溯着西班牙過去的威武的成就、和在他的名著「無骨氣的西班牙」（Ｅspana　Invertebrad　a）裏一樣、他激勵現代的西班牙青年去將他們的活動用在那些比運動游藝更有價値的目的上茄賽顯然是西班牙底民族主義的作家、他看見自己生活在這懨無生氣的時代、是學得不勝其痛苦的、他渴望西班牙人民底舊有的勇毅活力能夠蓬勃再興、他發現阿根廷和那些Pampao（大平原）是充溢着活力、居住着各民族底最進取的人物、這些人都具有强健的原始的衝動、狂熱的求生的意志、轟轟烈烈地做一番人的意志、這些都預示着他們將有一個强大的將來、將在歷史上得到一個崇高的地位、</p>
<h3>雷蒙萊特爾的見解</h3>
<p>西班牙不是男性的民族</p>
<p>和茄赛底新著性質全然不同的是雷蒙萊特爾（Ramon　Latre）底有趣的「何以西班牙人没有更多的成就」（Por　que）El　Esqanol　No　Ha　Llegado　a　Mas）、他的理論很别緻而且很有意思、他說、因爲移民及戰爭使得西班牙的女人在數目上比男子要多出許多的緣故、所以西班牙不是一個男性的民族（如盎格魯撤克遜民族）、而是一個女性的民族、照萊特爾底說法是、男性的民族是要求同一民族的人做君主、而女性的民族、如西班牙者、則屈服於外國人底統治之下、他們西班牙從來没有統洽過别的國家、西西里和奈不爾士都並不是西班牙人征服的、阿臘貢（Aragon）王族到前者去是因爲得到它的人民底同意、到後者去是因爲得到它的王后底同意、萊特爾承認西班牙人有一處男性的地方丨他們的反抗拿破崙、和一件女性的衝動、丨創造那所謂「西班牙美洲「（Hispamerica指南美洲諸國）、他否認這「西美」諸國之創造可以表明西班牙人底征服性、estilo　hsmbra（男性樣式）、他認爲這只是豐富生產力之表現之意義、所謂estilo　hembra　（女性樣式）是也、而且、他說、這些國家並不是西班牙人征服的、只是由西班牙人統治的、所以後來之和西班牙脫離、並不是西班牙衰落之象、他在西班牙這一個種族上找不出什麽衰落的地方、或是頽疲的地方、不過氣魄不大、生氣有限就是了、但是他以爲照了他所提議的辦法、這種缺點也是可以免去的、</p>
<p>從這些話看來、我們可以知道萊特爾是一位對於女性有特别研究的人、但是不幸得很、他是個女性憎惡者、他對於女性的態度就是一個女性憎惡者底菲薄蔑視的態度、所以他這部「何以西班牙没有更多的成就」當然不會得到西班牙婦女界底歡迎、因爲、萊特爾竟是老老實實地說、在生理上女人只是一個造人生孩子的機器、而在心靈上、她是什麽没有、她一生最熱心的事情就是將她身體的外部改造成一只精緻的理列箱、她的唯一的歷史就地這陳列箱中的變革、因爲除了裝飾之外什麽都不需要、女人可以吃惡劣的東西、過隨便的生活、然而男人呢、因爲他的心力和體力的勞動、是需要豐盛的食物、優美的生活情况和舒適的安息的、萊特爾又說、西班牙底母親們寵愛他們的兒子、弄得他們都成爲女性的、女人是一家之主、但因爲她們自己是温馴的、所以將這温馴的習性也傳給她們的後代、</p>
<h3>論文盛行時期</h3>
<p>最近的西班牙文壇是論文的盛行時期、孟蓄（Angel　Dotor　Y　Muncio）底新著也是一部論文集、題名「彌勒陀」（Mirador）、是討論現代西班牙的文章和藝術的、在這方面確能有所闡發、他那論西凡提斯（Cervantes）崇拜的一章、對於涉及「廣告珂德」（Don　Qulxote）　的不朽者作的西班牙論著有詳盡的探討、此外、他對於當代的西班牙的文藝界人物、多有很精確的批判、</p>
<p>卡司特洛（Americo　Castro）底新著也是論文集、名呌「聖打丹萊莎及其他論文」（Santa　Teresa　Y.　Otors　Ensayos）也是一部關於文學和歷史的書、聖打丹萊莎是十六世紀的西班牙女作家、據卡司特洛說、當時的大作家如西凡提斯特凡茄（Lope　de　Vega）、卡爾狄龍（Ｃalderon）等、雖然都有許多的讀者、但聖打丹萊莎底書所受的歡迎却更大、而她的著作是可以認爲十六世紀時卡司底（Casti）</p>
<p>le）語言的最完全的代表者的、此外、卡司特洛這部書中的幾篇論文都是討論的學術問題、有關於西班牙的歷史或文學的、因爲作者學識底廣博、這些論文是很有意味的、</p>
<p>西班牙人現在是正在高呼着西班牙之復興、而且是竭力在使這廿世紀的復興能夠和着的傳統銜接、因此從今年底春季起、在馬德里就出版了一種很可注意的新的季刊、Erudicion　Ibero　Ultramarina、這個評論底目的是主唱西班牙之復興、同時探討西班牙之過去、選述者都是西班牙底著名學者和作家、已出的三期共含五百除頁、内容很豐富、印刷也精美、每期約有二十頁的書報評論、和專講西班牙藝術的一欄、這一欄裏除文章之外並揷有一些比較地不熟見的西班牙繪畫、這三期裏就一共登出了十三幅、對於研究西班牙文化的人、這個雜誌確是不可少的好材料、</p>
<p>文壇雜話</p>
<h3>蕭伯訥全集與自序</h3>
<p>— 富蘭</p>
<p>蕭伯訥的全集、印數很有限、統共只有一千○二十五部、每部計三十卷、共售三十一鎊半、换句話說、目下定購這部書的人們、一共要付出三萬二千二百八十七鎊半的巨値、約合華幣五六十萬元之多、牠的代價、不能說可覯了、據新近蕭伯訥對一位訪問他的新聞記者說、「這部書只不過售給那些獃子和投機家罷了、」也許蕭伯訥有勇氣把定購諸位的姓氏宣布出來、</p>
<p>在這部書的第一卷上面、有蕭伯訥的一篇自傳體的序文、把他的自己生活故事、寫得非常忠實、從他在襁褓中叙起、後來到了二十歲、來到倫敦做十八先令一個月的出納員、直到他寫了小說没有出版家肯接受着去刊印的一個時期爲止、</p>
<p>說到了他的不善交際、當他第一次來到城市的時候、於是他兼叙他的父親</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>說、</p>
<p>「很是不幸、…我的父親有一習慣、只知道關門閉户、連帶害我的母親也不能好好地受人邀請、如果没有同他、…倘使你請他吃飯或參加茶會、他往往臨塲還得清醒、而離開時一定喝得沈醉如泥…吾們最後遂與社會一天疏似一天、」</p>
<p>「當我經過了幼年時代之後、始終不能到一家親族的家裏去探望他們、如果我的父親同母親出去吃飯、或應人家的約會、他們的兒女獨處家中、那時心中的驚惶、比房子着了火還要利害、我的母親虧了她的音樂本領、極救她脫離這個苦境、而我的父親、對於戒酒主義、也漸漸地由理論進於實踐、因爲他在一個星期日的下午、在我家門口階沿上爲了一陣痙攣、倒在地上、因此覺悟到必須戒絶喝酒、不然就要死亡了、</p>
<p>「只是他的改革太遲了些、不及挽救社會上的地位、而我對於社交的途徑、更是茫無所措、」</p>
<p>蕭伯訥這篇文章發表後、有位前任浸禮敎會主席的卡利爾博士、新近在福克斯敦演說、稱蕭伯訥對於他父親飲酒之事、叙得很是忠實、但說「如果蕭伯訥對於此層能爲一種有價値的聲述、那是我們對於他的禮貌問題、很容易原諒、但我們寗願他不具家庭的輪廓、爲什麽他將他父親的事實、赤裸地披露出來、作爲他自己短處的辨護呢、」</p>
<p>後來蕭伯訥經一家報館的訪員告知、遂回答訪員道、「從他的眼光中看來、我當然没有什麽禮貌、一位浸禮敎士理想中的良好禮貌。在我身上當然是我不到的。我已經十分忠實地叙述吾的父親、不論何人、都能從我身上看出一切、我想我講我自己的故事、不更比一位浸禮敎徒越俎代謀來得好嗎、」</p>
<h3>路旁之花</h3>
<p>— 素</p>
<p>「朝爲越溪女、暮作吴宮妃、」這是我國感慨美人命運無常的詩句、但西施雖被識拔於吴王宮中、而那零落於越溪的路傍花草、正不知還有許多、這正是古今詩人同聲感慨的地方了、</p>
<p>這裏來寫一個巴黎歌壇上的路旁之花、她的過去、也正像那浣紗溪畔不遇的越女一樣、</p>
<p>在明朗的南歐的巴黎、一般著着輕裝的巴黎兒、在初夏的傍晚、總快樂地出來散步、或在充滿烟草的紫烟和暢快的歡笑的珈琲店裏、做他們短時間的歇脚、</p>
<p>充滿着絮語與口笛與杯盤聲音的珈琲店、每夜出現了很年青的歌聲、這具有異國的容貌與魅力的歌者、有很强的魅力、使人忘了回家地在那裏流連地聽着、</p>
<p>這漂泊的歌女、人人都不知道她住在那裏、只一般聽了她歌聲的年青人、都瘋狂一樣的每晚在珈琲店去等着她、甚至有跟她從這個咖啡店到那個咖啡店去的、</p>
<p>「我…我生在威尼斯、是船户的女兒、在水上長大的、我没有姓氏、」</p>
<p>她總這樣快活地答那問她的人、意大利的姑娘、船户的女兒、水上長大的、—聽見這些自述的人、都各人在腦裏描寫那温暖的夏夜、緩緩的鏡一樣的流水、和那羅曼締克的弓弦拉、彷彿覺得從她身上已經帶來了那詩情的南國所持有的香與色一樣、</p>
<p>一次她突然失踪、各咖啡店裏、再聽不見她美好的聲音、也不再見她那明朗的笑顏、年青的顧客、都沈悶起來、店裏只剩那杯盤陰氣的聲音、人人像在黑暗中失去了氣力一樣、大家談話、也只談着這歌女突然不見的事、</p>
<p>「那姑娘眞地和一個紳士一道走着、」</p>
<p>「紳士嗎、」</p>
<p>「不錯、很體面的紳士、只是不年青、是過了中年的、」互相這樣謠傳着、但没有一個人知道她眞眞的消息、</p>
<p>「那意大利的姑娘怎樣了、」</p>
<p>時常有了這樣問着、但隨着各人吐的失望的呼息一齋、再不見有人回答、就這樣經過了幾個月、</p>
<p>一次大家忽然高興、像尋見甚麽珍寳似的呼嘈着、</p>
<p>「到布發歌劇院去、」</p>
<p>「到布發歌劇院去、」</p>
<p>呌着這句話、像水一樣、從珈啡店跑向布發歌劇院去、</p>
<p>布發歌劇院是十八世紀末、在巴徐達到全盛的頂點的歌劇院、</p>
<p>夏天以來、在各珈啡店消失了她的容姿的意大利姑娘、忽然在這舞台上出現、一般長久寂寞過來的巴黎兒、不消說歡喜她的出現、就是别的觀客、聽了她那美的聲音、也没有不爲她驚歎讚美的、</p>
<p>昨日船户的姑娘、漂泊的歌女、一躍就做了這巴黎的藝壇的花、在一夜裏、使全巴黎都記着她新的藝名「布麗瑪東娜</p>
<p>是她最後在珈琲店唱歌的一夜、當她走出珈琲店的時候、有一個體面的紳士睬着她、這紳士就是布發歌劇塲的經理人、他對她美的歌聲、具着非常的熱心、就在這夜、他領她到劇塲去、</p>
<p>從流落的姑娘、做了巴黎舞台上的幸運之花、就像一朶路旁之花被人賞識、頓時就聲價百倍一樣、她的名字呌旁底、</p>
<h3>没感情的希臘人</h3>
<p>— 素</p>
<p>戈—太兒、惠絲多利亞是過去的一個有名的跳舞家、名實相共的他是當時跳無界的第一人、他也非常自信、嘗自誇說、</p>
<p>「歐洲只有三個眞眞的大人物、即是布洛西的菲力多里大王與維特爾和我自己、」</p>
<p>因此他看不起任何人、在當時樂界、持着一個大勢力、被人崇爲音樂之神的「枯爾克」、他也只不過看他做一個音樂學生、一次「戈—太兒」爲他的跳舞、需要一個新譜、却來找到這被他看爲一介學生的「枯爾克」、</p>
<p>「給我作一個希臘跳舞的曲子、這……」</p>
<p>「希臘跳舞的曲子……知道了、要怎樣的曲子、」</p>
<p>「唔、但是、枯爾克、我要你寫卡考萊舞（Choconne）（爲一種西班牙古舞、起於一五九一年、盛行於十八世紀、今已廢、）的曲子、這能夠罷、喂…」</p>
<p>「卡考萊舞、」枯爾克很討厭他的豪慢、却平氣地答他、「是卡考來舞、你不是說要配希臘跳舞的音樂嗎、你以爲從前的希臘人知道這個卡考萊舞的音樂形式嗎、實在古代希臘、是没有這個東西的、」</p>
<p>這樣像劍一樣的冷然地說出來、這以歐羅巴三傑自任的戈—太兒、只　　着說、</p>
<p>「怎麽、不知道、不知道卡考萊舞、哼……、不知道卡考萊舞、那希臘人眞是一種没有感情的人民、」</p>
<p>爲這次談判的失敗、在戈—太兒終身的跳舞裏、找不出一個枯爾克的曲子、（素）</p>

We are overjoyed beyond measure, and from this day forward, the mountains and rivers of the two regions will no longer serve as a shield for those who betray the nation. Shaanxi, with its revolutionary spirit, is returned to the governance of the revolutionary government and is now under the control of revolutionary comrades. What could be more gratifying? We sincerely wish you a great victory!" (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>

(29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Speech</h3>
<p>Mussolini's speech is seen by the world as if a bomb has been dropped, turning the hopes of international disarmament into nothing. But this is not necessarily the case. If international disarmament truly held promise, it would not be turned into nothing by Mussolini alone. It would not be turned into nothing by just one speech of Mussolini's. Although Italy is not weak today, and Mussolini's "cudgel party" is very powerful in Italy, it is unreasonable to think they could defy the world. If the hope of international disarmament is only nominal, and the inside and outside do not match, then the hope of international disarmament will eventually turn to nothing. Even if Mussolini's speech cannot draw the world's attention and transform it into genuine international disarmament, it will only make the hope that turns to nothing change from slight to obvious, from slow to fast. Therefore, it is said that it is not necessarily so. As for Italy's "cudgel party" claiming that it can spread "cudgel-ism" throughout Europe, that is also not necessarily true. Each country has its own situation. What succeeds in Country A may not succeed in Country B and may even fail. Forcing those who are different to be the same, forcing those who cannot do something to do it, throughout history, there have been countless examples of imitating others and not benefiting from it, but instead suffering from it. How can one say that because one has achieved something, others can also achieve it, and hope that others will imitate it? Therefore, it is said that it is not necessarily entirely true.</p>
<p>Domestic Telegrams II</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Expresses Complete Obedience to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Currently Plans to Choose a Place to Meet with Jiang</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Zhang Xueliang recently met with someone and reiterated the main purpose of the Northeast Army's entry into the customs, which has been previously stated and will not be repeated here. Since the Northeast Army peacefully took over Tianjin and Beiping, local order has been gradually restored. However, at the beginning of the handover, there was deep concern about local disorder, so personnel were temporarily appointed to maintain the status quo, and he is very pleased that this goal has been achieved. In the future, regarding military matters, such as the deployment of troops and the location of defenses, he will completely comply with the Central Government's orders. Even regarding administrative matters, such as the appointment and removal of local officials and the reform of administrative organs, he will also comply with the Central Government's orders. Regarding the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, he will follow the Central Government's orders. (28th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Zhang Xueliang told a reporter from the North-China Daily News that the editorial published by the newspaper on October 20th was inaccurate. There is no resentment between him and Chairman Jiang [Jieshi]. The rumors from outside are completely baseless. They are now frankly discussing various issues to achieve complete understanding. In the future, political power will be in the hands of the Central Government, and all orders issued from Nanjing will be valid. There are currently many people in central China who are creating rumors and causing trouble, hoping to promote war and profit from it. If the North and South cooperate to quell this, and endure for the sake of the country, then there will be no room for suspicion. Zhang now hopes to choose a place to meet with Chairman Jiang to discuss the procedures for maintaining public order and improving the national situation. (27th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Zhang Xueliang has established ten measures for rectifying military discipline, which were issued to all troops stationed inside and outside the customs yesterday for compliance. (28th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>

(3) The Deputy Commander's Office has been temporarily established in Liaoning, and personnel have been assigned to begin its organization, which will be established at the beginning of next month. (4) The number of troops within the customs is insufficient for allocation, and he is currently preparing to organize the Third Army. (5) The Northeast is financially insufficient, and the Central Government is requested to issue funds for the costs of the handover within the customs as soon as possible. (6) The plan for the separation of military and civilian administration in the Northeast has been decided to be implemented in the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931]. (7) The Border Defense Department will be reorganized, its scope will be reduced, and military factories and other agencies will also be cut down, saving one million per month. (8) The Northeast must give considerable consideration to the areas other than Beiping and Tianjin to be taken over as defense areas. (9) The Northeast Navy is very small in scale, and it is necessary to expand it, planning to add a fleet of 200 ships and build four warships. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jinpu Railway to Directly Operate on a Regular Schedule</h3>
<p>The Northern Section Administration Bureau Has Been Abolished</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of direct train service on the Jinpu Railway, the Ministry of Railways has reached an agreement with Zhang Xueliang after exchanging telegrams. Qu Yucan will be transferred to another route, and the Jinpu Railway will begin direct train service on the 30th [day of the month]. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways received a telegram from Zhang Xueliang on the 27th [day of the month], stating that the railway administration should be unified, and he has ordered the abolition of the Northern Section Administration Bureau of the Jinpu Railway, requesting that the entire railway be opened to traffic as soon as possible. The Ministry telegraphed the Jinpu Railway Bureau to take over and rush to open the line. The Shanghai Bureau has already complied with the order, and the director of the Tianjin office, Gao Hengru, as well as the chief officers of the Tianjin section's vehicles, engineering, machinery, and police, are quickly taking over, restoring the office, and handling traffic and railway affairs as usual, as well as military transportation matters in that section. They are also rushing to ensure that the first and second passenger trains will run directly to Tianjin starting on the 30th [day of the month], and that the Pingpu [Beiping-Pukou] train service will also run directly to Tianjin starting on November 1st. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the issue of the directors of the Jinpu Railway bureaus has been resolved. The original deputy director of the Northern Bureau, Qu Yucan, was recommended by Shi Yousan and appointed by Yan Xishan. After the Northeast Army occupied Beiping and Tianjin, the director appointed by Yan, Liu Encheng, immediately left the bureau. Shi asked the Northeast to keep Qu Yucan. Zhang Xueliang, for the convenience of military transportation, immediately ordered Qu to act as the director. Qu is not a Northeast personnel. Now, after Wu Tiecheng explained it to Zhang, Zhang immediately telegraphed to abolish the Jinpu Tianjin Bureau and restore the office. Qu Yucan, the acting director, was transferred to be the deputy director of the Zhengtai Railway, and Tang Wengao was transferred to the Cangshi Railway. Qu returned to Tianjin from Liaoning to complete the handover, and Zhu Lüyun, sent by the Shanghai Bureau, took over, assisted by Wang Jieqing, the chief of the Shanghai Bureau's police department. The direct train service from Shanghai to Tianjin has now been restored. Zhang Xueliang further ordered that some of the trains released by the Jin army in Shijiazhuang be returned to the Jinpu Railway. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>

He had met with Shi Yousan in Shenyang, and Shi will stay in Shenyang for a few more days. He will complete the closure upon arrival in Tianjin and then go to Shijiazhuang to assume the post of director of the Zhengtai Bureau. The road has 80 locomotives and more than 1,000 passenger and freight cars, which is a French investment. After he takes office in Shijiazhuang, passenger and freight cars can directly reach Taiyuan, and soldiers cannot interfere. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jiang Menglin's Talk Amidst the Central University Turmoil</h3>
<p>"President Zhang's Statement is a Misunderstanding"</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reports, Central University President Zhang Naiyan's letter to all faculty and students contained references to Jiang Menglin. I specifically visited Jiang yesterday. According to Jiang, the four points mentioned in President Zhang's original letter were misunderstandings. Firstly, in the autumn of the year before last, he did go to Central University to give a lecture to the students of the College of Education, talking about the school's turmoil. Because the students of that college would be engaged in education as a profession in the future, he discussed its causes and effects, intending to encourage students, faculty, and school authorities to work together to develop academics. However, President Zhang took it out of context and mistakenly believed that it had other implications. Secondly, last summer and this summer, Central University faculty and students fought twice for funding, but the president did not come forward. The students repeatedly asked the Ministry of Education to quickly submit a proposal and notified the resolution. The Ministry of Education, mindful of the students' earnest expectations, informed the school by letter after the resolution and then issued an order. Private letters do not require drafts and are faster than official documents. Thirdly, this year, students from the College of Education at Central University organized a Northeast Education Inspection Group and requested subsidies from the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education did not approve it because it had not been requested through the school, and the procedures were not followed. Later, Dean Wei came to the Ministry to discuss the matter, and it was decided that the Ministry and the school would bear the costs equally. Then, Central University Secretary-General Zhang came to the Ministry because the school's funds were insufficient and requested subsidies. He was told that the Ministry of Education's funds were also insufficient and was told that Central University should not go back on its word. However, given that the school's statement that its funds were stretched was also true, a compromise was made to increase the amount. This matter was purely because the responsible personnel of the school sincerely stated that the school should visit, and it could not be avoided, and the school's funds were stretched, and they requested subsidies from the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Education automatically. Fourthly, as for his statement to Chairman Jiang that Central University was a battleground for nationalism and communism, this was absolutely not the case. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central University Professor Ma Yuan and others have requested that President Zhang return to the school as soon as possible to preside over school affairs. (29th [day of the month] Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Brigade Commander of Liu's Troops Reports on the Incident of Rebellion in Huixian</h3>
<p>Liu Wanchun and Others Are Currently Stationed in Qixian</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Wanchun, the brigade commander of Liu Chunrong's troops, and Shen Tichen, after escaping danger, are currently stationed in Qixian and have telegraphed to report on the incident of rebellion. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Our troops were stationed in Hebei, engaged in training, with the intention of serving the country, awaiting demobilization. However, on the 23rd of this month, the special service battalion and the 46th and 2nd regiments suddenly rebelled. Taking advantage of our army commander convening a meeting of regimental commanders, they opened fire without allowing them to speak. Our army commander was shot and fell to the ground, and most of the regimental commanders were killed. Of the five brigade commanders, one died, two were detained, and two escaped danger. All the officers of the army, including military officers, students, and those from the ranks, except for a few who escaped, were spared. Wanchun and others were shocked and hastily led their troops to escape danger and are now stationed in Qixian, seeking assistance from friendly forces. We have heard that the ringleader, Chen Huiwu, the fourth regimental commander, claims to be the army commander, and the special service battalion commander, Chen Beiren, and battalion commander Chen Mingtang are appointed brigade commanders, all of whom were military students educated by our army commander. Now, they disregard the friendship between teachers and students, are deceived by others, and kill all their superiors in one fell swoop. This is a great betrayal, and the lust for profit has clouded their minds. Compared to Bai Qi's burial of soldiers alive, it is even more cruel. Compared to Shang Chen's patricide, their crime is even greater. If this trend continues, how can humanity survive? We implore our wise and virtuous officials to jointly punish them, eliminate these evil-doers, rectify discipline, and correct people's hearts. Wanchun awaits punishment in Qixian and is willing to be the vanguard. If he can personally kill these traitors, he will be willing to die. Crying and weeping, we present our case, and our words are disordered.</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>We respectfully submit this telegram for your perusal. We beseech you to consider it. Liu Wanchun, the brigade commander of the Independent Second Brigade of the 20th Army of the Army, Shen Tichen, the brigade commander of the 42nd Brigade, and all officers and soldiers kowtow.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Chunrong's troops seek assistance from Shi Yousan, requesting him to send troops to attack Chen Yaowu. Chen Yaowu declares that since Liu Chunrong had previously rebelled against the Central Government, his subordinates' action to eliminate Liu is a return to righteousness.

It has been resolved to approve the original plan. However, concerning the use of mechanical dredgers for dredging, after examining the Yangtze River's current, heavy silt content, and rapid sedimentation, based on years of actual measurement experience, there are concerns that using mechanical dredgers may not achieve a lasting effect. However, to prevent siltation from recurring upstream and downstream after construction, one or two temporary dredgers may be used on a trial basis to assist in the excavation. A request has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, and the principle is approved. The Ministry of Transportation will prepare a detailed plan and submit it for further review.

<h3>Jia Shiyi Discusses Tax Reduction Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jia Shiyi, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, stated that the preparations for tax reduction are generally complete. However, the issue of compensation after the tax reduction, mainly through establishing consumption and business taxes, is still significantly short of the budget after careful planning. The implementation of new tariffs is closely related to the national tax reduction. The draft of the new import tariffs has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review for a long time and can be completed in two weeks. The National Government is expected to announce it in late November. However, the new tariffs must be implemented one month after promulgation, so the timing can still be coordinated with the tax reduction. (October 29th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Opening of Parliament, British Monarch Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Concerned About Domestic Unemployment, Striving to Seek Relief</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Rejects Imperial Free Trade as Absurd</p>
<p>Change of Conservative Party Leader Imminent</p>
<p>Reuters, London, October 28th. At the opening of Parliament, the British Monarch delivered a speech expressing attention to the work of the Imperial Conference and hoping that the Indian Round Table Conference would satisfactorily resolve important issues. He also stated that an agreement to assist invaded countries has recently been signed in Geneva, with conditions attached to the implementation of a disarmament treaty. Therefore, he hopes that the disarmament treaty will be established soon. The high number of unemployed people in the country is still a cause for anxiety. Recent economic depression has spread across the globe, and international trade is subject to many restrictions. Industries relying on exports are particularly affected. However, the government continues to work tirelessly to develop domestic, imperial, and overseas trade, and to promote the efficiency of various industries. It will soon submit to Parliament proposals to increase land work to settle the unemployed, and to reorganize industries to promote exports. The government will organize a committee immediately to investigate the unemployment insurance system. At the same time, it will submit to Parliament a plan to increase the unemployment fund. Furthermore, proposals regarding electoral reform, raising the compulsory education age, amending commercial dispute laws, establishing a consumer council, and approving the Washington Hours of Work and Maritime Safety Conventions will be submitted to Parliament successively.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, October 28th. During the debate in the House of Commons this afternoon on the British Monarch's speech, Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the economic events of the Imperial Conference have been particularly emphasized for partisan reasons. However, the most important and most permanent work is the implementation of the 1926 Imperial Conference's various declarations regarding the constitutional political relations between the autonomous territories. This work is now gradually being completed. If British manufacturers know how to fully utilize the existing preferential treatment, without waiting for the autonomous territories to increase their preferential treatment, then Britain's exports to the autonomous territories can be expected to increase greatly. What people call imperial free trade today is absolute nonsense. The only tax rate that Britain can implement that the autonomous territories could consider beneficial is, namely, a food tax. In fact, the current government will definitely not do it. The number of unemployed people announced by various countries in the world is not as accurate as that of the United Kingdom. A major American industrialist once said that if the United States adopted the same method, it would see a total of ten million to twelve million unemployed people in the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, October 28th. Conservative Party leader Baldwin stated that the Palestine White Paper has clearly shown a significant change in British policy. This change is very dangerous because it is tantamount to the British government going back on its word. In the current situation in the East, and at a time when Britain is about to convene the Indian Round Table Conference, if people are led to believe that Britain cannot avoid difficulties and maintain its previous commitments, the danger is even greater. Prime Minister MacDonald replied to this statement in the House of Commons today, saying that the Palestine White Paper does not indicate any change in Britain's policy towards Palestine.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, October 28th. Forty-four Conservative Party members met here today, chaired by MP Clayton, and decided to draft a declaration to the Conservative Party's general leader, stating that for the sake of national interests, it is necessary to change the Conservative Party leader.</p>

<h3>Greek Alliance Land Policy Success</h3>
<p>Eastern European Situation Changes</p>
<p>National News, Ankara, October 28th. Greek Prime Minister Venizelos's visit to Turkey to discuss and establish a treaty of friendship is considered a great success. After Mr. Venizelos met with the Turkish President and Foreign Minister, the Turkish Prime Minister held a grand banquet today to formally welcome them. Speeches from both sides emphasized the importance of friendship between the two countries and the satisfying results of the continuous meetings. Turkish newspapers also expressed a warm welcome, saying that this move is not only important in the Near East, but also in the entire Europe and the world. Mr. Venizelos is a major European statesman who has always strongly opposed Turkey. His personal arrival in the Turkish capital carrying the banner of peace is sufficient to show that Greece's foreign policy has fundamentally changed, and Turkey's political position in Europe and internationally is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Speech Like Throwing a Bomb</h3>
<p>Hopes for International Disarmament Turned to Ashes</p>
<p>German Newspaper Views Pro and Con</p>
<p>Stock Market Situation Initially Affected</p>
<p>Commemoration Day of the Fascist March on Rome</p>
<p>All of Italy Celebrates Madly</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, October 28th. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech on Monday commemorating the Fascist March on Rome was like throwing a large bomb into the European political arena, turning the world's various hopes for the International League of Nations Disarmament Preparatory Committee into ashes. This preparatory committee is the final committee meeting before convening the Disarmament Conference. Therefore, so far only Italian newspapers have warmly welcomed Mussolini's speech and his order to advance and spread Fascism throughout Europe, viewing it as Mussolini's strong determination to lead Italy to permanently reside among the world's first-class countries. This is in contrast to the lip service of politicians from other countries, who constantly speak of peace, cooperation, and alliance, but actually condone cabinet members in using what they call huge sums of money necessary to repair wartime losses to expand armaments and threaten neighboring countries. As for German newspapers, their views are mixed. The right-wing newspapers, especially the National Socialist newspapers, praised his proposal to revise the treaty, which shows friendship towards Germany. The right-wing and liberal newspapers were mostly cold and sarcastic, asking how the Southern Tyrol region of Italy, which was seized from Austria, will be handled, and refuting the idea that the world and Germany can be saved by Fascism or other forms of dictatorship. The German Newspaper, the organ of the Central Clerical Party, often representing the views of Catholic leaders, also condemned Mussolini's ambition to spread Fascism throughout Europe, saying that some of his words must be regarded as interference in Germany's internal affairs and are not friendly acts towards a friendly country. Furthermore, the semi-official Foreign Political Communication News stated that this speech was more moderate and valuable than Mussolini's previous speeches, and it was sufficient to express Italy's attitude on several diplomatic and political issues related to Germany. However, the newspaper also disagreed with his words regarding the Fascist movement.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, October 28th. Today, the stock market situation on the stock exchange fluctuated, because Mussolini's speech caused concerns about the current European political situation and the world economic life.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, October 28th. Today is the anniversary of the Fascist March on Rome. All of Italy is celebrating enthusiastically. This year, three thousand public buildings are having completion or naming ceremonies. The new station in Genoa, built with 17 million lire, is also among them. This afternoon, Mussolini personally inspected the parade of the Blackshirts. In the evening, the streets of the capital are brightly lit with electric lights, and there are crowds of tourists. The area near Mussolini's private residence is particularly crowded.</p>
<h3>Continuing Reports on the Aboriginal Resistance in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Occupation of Mt. Nōkō's Watershed</p>
<p>Local Authorities Busy Dispatching Troops and Police</p>
<p>Dentsu, Taipei, 28th—Regarding the Wushe aboriginal rebellion, according to later reports, on the morning of the 27th at 8:00 AM, a group of several hundred aborigines led by a chieftain named Mōraru attacked the athletic meet at the Wushe Public School, brutally murdering some twenty-odd people including Nōkō District Magistrate Ogasawara, school staff, and police officers who were in attendance. Subsequently, they indiscriminately massacred local mainland Chinese and Taiwanese, and attacked the police precinct, seizing 170 rifles and 300 rounds of ammunition. They then prepared for battle, planning to attack Pulishe. Upon receiving the report, the Taichung police requested reinforcements from the Taipei, South, and North police. The Onizumi Company stationed in Taichung also urgently departed for Puli. In addition, Hualien Port dispatched 80 infantrymen and 50 police officers to attack the aboriginal villages from three sides. Operations commenced on the morning of the 29th. About 270 mainland Chinese and 430 Taiwanese reside in the area at the center of the disturbances. As of last night, only 140 have escaped. The safety of the rest is unknown. The Susha aborigines, who belong to the Atayal people, number 2,170 in total, all from local villages. Many other aborigines reside near these villages. This rebellion is an isolated action by the Wushe aborigines and is not related to others. Puli has already begun defensive measures. Iron netting has been laid between Puli and Wushe, and electrified. Police, local militia, Taiwanese, and various organizations are cooperating in the guard.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th—The Colonial Ministry received a telegram stating that at 8:00 AM on the 29th, police units had expelled the aborigines and occupied Wushe. According to an official gazette from the Taiwan Governor-General's Office on the same day, the aborigines have attacked the outposts on the western side of Mt. Nōkō from today and occupied Mt. Nōkō's watershed. 150 police officers in the vicinity have advanced to East Nōkō. According to an announcement by the Taiwan Governor-General's Police Bureau, the cause of this disturbance seems to be the recent frequent incidents of forced labor. Others say that a Class B police officer from a certain village started the uprising due to resentment over unequal monthly wages. An investigation is currently underway. The Colonial Ministry received a telegram stating that of the 17 Wushe outposts, as many as 13 have been attacked by aborigines.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Taipei, 29th—According to a report obtained by the Taiwan Army Command, the Takai Unit and the Kudo Unit, which were dispatched to suppress the Wushe aborigines, occupied the aboriginal front line village of Riqing around 1:00 AM today. They then cooperated with army aircraft in a fierce battle, occupying Wushe at 8:05 AM. The aborigines fled into the nearby mountains, continuing to resist from the high ground. Another telegram stated that the Takai Unit, which occupied Wushe this morning, immediately began recovering the bodies of the murdered Japanese. The body of District Magistrate Ogasawara, who was in Wushe at the time, was found murdered on a bridge north of Wushe, hidden under the bridge. By noon, a total of 183 bodies had been found, including 38 children. The manner of death was extremely gruesome. Survivors are hiding in the bushes, etc. The aborigines indiscriminately slaughtered both Japanese and Taiwanese, carrying food and supplies into the deep mountains. After the mountain artillery arrives, they will launch a fierce attack on the hiding areas.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th—According to news from Taiwan, about 140 Japanese police and civilians have died in the uprising of the Taiwanese aborigines. However, this has not been confirmed due to telephone interruptions. The aborigines previously revolted in 1920 and have since lived peacefully. The cause of this uprising is unknown. Some say it is due to overly strict police control. Others say that a certain company recently agreed to borrow 45 million Japanese yen from the American Morgan Company and plans to build a large dam somewhere to build a hydroelectric power plant. If this plan is implemented, it will flood several square miles of aboriginal residential areas, forcing the aborigines to relocate, so they gathered to resist. According to an official telegram from Taiwan, of the more than 200 Japanese residing in the affected area, only 16 escaped. Of the 400 Taiwanese, only 112 escaped. It is feared that the rest have been killed.</p>

<h3>German Federal Council Foreign Affairs Committee Meets</h3>
<p>Communist Party Member Proposes a Motion to Stop Paying Reparations</p>
<p>Government Representatives Account for Only a Small Minority, Situation Unfavorable</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 29th—The German Federal Council's Foreign Affairs Committee began its meeting today. The position of the government representatives is extremely precarious. Even with the support of the Social Democrats, they remain in the minority. The representatives attending on behalf of the government are Foreign Minister Curtius, along with the Finance and Justice Ministers. The most noteworthy item on the agenda is the Communist Party's proposal to immediately halt the payment of reparations stipulated in the Young Plan. It is expected that this proposal will receive unanimous support from the Nationalist Party and the National Socialist Party. If so, it is bound to pass with a majority vote. However, even if it passes in the committee, it is unlikely to be implemented, as the case still needs to be considered by the full council. It seems that there is no doubt that this case will be rejected by the full council.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Military Government's Proclamation to the People</h3>
<p>Dissolving Congress is Inevitable</p>
<p>International Treaties Will Certainly Be Respected</p>
<p>Pacific Press, Rio de Janeiro, 28th—The military group issued a proclamation to the Brazilian people, stating that the dissolution of Congress and the granting of amnesty are the results of the successful revolution. Once President Vargas arrives in the capital, they will be announced and implemented. Furthermore, the orders to cease hostilities and restore peace have already been issued. It also stated that order and tranquility must be maintained, justice must be upheld, treaties must be respected, and unity must be maintained.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 29th—It is learned that in this Brazilian revolution, a total of 1,000 people died in the battles from October 15 to 20.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain, Snow, and Hail in Lower Silesia</h3>
<p>Rivers Overflow, Drowning People and Livestock</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th—In Lower Silesia, Germany, incessant heavy rain mixed with snow and hail has caused rivers to overflow. Many bridges and embankments have been destroyed. The lower reaches of the Oder River have become a flooded area, with no fewer than several thousand houses submerged. Many people and livestock have drowned.

<h3>Berlin Metalworkers Resume Work</h3>

It is learned that the workers lost a total of 10 million marks in wages during this strike.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance's Demand for Savings</h3>
<p>Army and Navy Departments Collude to Resist</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 29th—The Ministry of Finance's review proposal requires the Army and Navy to save a total of 86 million yen. The Army is indignant at its unreasonableness, especially the hardliners in the General Staff, who claim that this is a despotic act of the Ministry of Finance giving undue weight to economic matters, and disregarding the Empire's national defense policy. They advocate that the Army and Navy should cooperate in the future and negotiate with the Ministry of Finance with a resolute attitude. If the relationship between the government and the military becomes complicated, the government and the party will do their best to attack or publicize the military's tyranny. Therefore, the Army and Navy should also share joint responsibility, clarify the military's position, and await fair criticism. The General Staff believes that it is the duty of those who are directly responsible for national defense and advocate that the Army and Navy jointly resist.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian King Returns Home by Ship with Queen</h3>
<p>Encountering a Strong Gale, Communication Severed</p>
<p>National News Agency, Sofia, 28th—The Bulgarian King, after going to Italy to marry, has returned home by ship with the new Queen on the Ferdinando di Savoia. However, no wireless reports from the ship have been received here, and the public is quite anxious. However, no other ships have been heard to have received distress signals from the ship, and it is believed that they are safe en route. It is likely that the wireless communication was interrupted due to the strong winds. The people here have prepared a grand welcoming ceremony, and are somewhat disappointed by the long wait for news of the King and Queen. Especially as it is late autumn, florists are finding it difficult to find another batch of fresh flowers at this time.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of the Great Battle Near Nanning</h3>
<p>Guangdong Army Prepares to Attack Liuzhou, Guangxi Army Changes Defense Lines</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence, the war in Nanning has recently become more intense. Zhang Guijiun believes that since Yan and Feng in the north have fallen, he is afraid of being isolated in Guangxi, so he is desperately fighting for Nanning in order to make a final struggle. At the beginning of this month, he began to use plainclothes teams to attack the 10th and 8th Route Armies surrounding Nanning. The fighting between the two sides was intermittent. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, Zhang Guijiun's army in Liuzhou launched another large-scale attack. The destinations were Nanning and Guixian. From the morning of the 16th, the Wei Yunsong and Huang Xuchu troops in Nanning City first rushed out of the city and attacked the 10th Route Guangxi Army four times in succession. At about 10:00 AM on the same day, more than 10,000 Guangxi troops from Qianjiang, Laibin, and other places in Liuzhou, including Liang Chaoji and Mo Shujie's troops and Zhang Jun and Xue Yue's troops, rushed straight to the city. From then on, they attacked the Guangxi Army from inside and outside. The Guangxi Army's Lu Han, Zhu Xu, and Zhang Chong divisions fought separately. Although the positions were all occupied by Zhang Guijiun's army, they still fought fiercely for three days and nights. By dawn on the 19th, the Guangxi Army's baggage and supplies had suffered heavy losses, and they changed their strategy, temporarily shortening the defense line. Liang Chaoji, Xue Yue, and other troops immediately entered Nanning and joined forces with the Huang and Wei troops in the city. At present, one part of the Guangxi Army has retreated to the fortress more than 20 miles outside Yongcheng, and another part has retreated to the Shibu Genzhuzhou Taiping area to concentrate, and will join forces with the 8th Route Army to attack after replenishment. During the great battle near Nanning, at the same time, the Guangxi Army's Yang Tenghui troops attacked the 8th Route Army's Yu Hanmou troops in Binyang's rear. Xu Shi immediately sent Li Zhenqiu's brigade to Silong to fight. Also, the Guangxi Army's Liang Hansong troops led four regiments to disturb the Dacun Market in Guixian on the 19th (about 20 miles from Litang). The 8th Route Army's Chen Hanguang regiment stationed in Litang went to resist. The two sides fought fiercely until the evening of the 22nd, with more than 1,000 casualties, and were defeated by Chen's regiment. The Guangxi Army's Liang troops retreated to above the Dacun Market. In Silong, the two sides also fought fiercely for three days. The Guangxi Army's Yang troops suffered more losses. At present, they have failed and returned to Shanglin. According to news from the front, the front-line war is still very tense. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the 8th Route Army, personally went to Taozhou on the 21st to plan the offensive strategy, and convened a military meeting with front-line generals Huang Renhuan, Yu Hanmou, Chen Hanguang, Li Yangjing, and Fan Dexing. He returned to Wu on the same day and telegraphed the commander of the 4th Fleet, Chen Ce, to go to Wu to discuss sending the fleet to the front to help in the war. Chen Riji will lead the fleet west. On the land front, due to the outbreak of the war, the vanguard Yu and Huang troops will advance to Xiangxian and Liuqing. The rear troops of the 8th Route Army should advance to fill the defense. The 63rd Division's Huang Zhiwen brigade stationed in Pingnan was transferred to Guixian to join the front line. The Lin Bin troops of the replenishment regiment stationed in Wu were sent to Guiping to help defend. Also, two regiments of the Independent Brigade Zhang Ruigui troops transferred from the rear will depart from Zhaoqing for Wuzhou on a specific day to take over the Lin regiment's defense areas of Huoshan Fuhekou and Tengjiangkou. At present, there are Peng Guangting's Special Service Battalion stationed at the airport in Wuzhou, the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the 1st Independent Brigade stationed in Hexianzhou, the artillery company of the regiment stationed in Sanjiaozui, the machine gun company stationed at the former British Consulate, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 63rd Division's Education Regiment stationed in Duhe Huoshan. The various companies of the 3rd Battalion of the Independent Brigade are stationed in the Shizi Fort, Lengshuidong, and Dalikou, and the defense is very tight. (October 24)</p>
<h3>Atrocities of Japanese Students in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Beating and Injuring Tiezong Students and Injuring Police</p>
<p>Surrounding the Police Station and Destroying the Office</p>
<p>Qingdao correspondence, on the 24th of this month, Tiezong students and Japanese middle school students held an autumn international sports basketball preliminary competition at the Huiquan Sports Field. As a result, Tiezong won by a large margin of 32 to 12. After the Japanese middle school failed, they became angry and provoked trouble for no reason. While on the court, they kicked and injured Tiezong student Yu Zhixin's legs in several places, and stepped on and injured Jiang Xiling's feet in two places. After the end, they searched everywhere for Tiezong students with the intention of fighting. In the end, with the maintenance of the referees of the international sports meeting, no accident occurred. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 PM on the same afternoon, Tiezong students Liu Zhende and Yu Yikui were walking home from school when they came to the middle section of Jiangsu Road. Suddenly, more than a dozen Japanese middle school students surrounded Liu and Yu, punching and kicking them, kicking Liu Zhende in the face and knocking out several teeth, causing blood to flow like a fountain. Fortunately, two students from Lixian Middle School rushed to mediate and found police officer Xing Jiying of the 15th Police Station of the Public Security Bureau who tried his best to dissuade them. At this time, more and more Japanese students gathered, about 40 in total, relying on their strength to commit violence and disobeying persuasion. They even pressed police officer Xing Jiying to the ground and beat him severely, tearing off his collar badge and tearing a piece of his uniform. Seeing that he could not stop them, the police officer broke through the encirclement and returned to the station to report. Students Liu Zhen, Yu Yikui, outnumbered, also fled to the station to temporarily avoid the fierce attack. Unexpectedly, the Japanese students saw Tiezong students fleeing into the station and immediately surrounded the station. A Japanese middle school teacher was directing from the side. Seeing the menacing situation, the patrol chief of the station immediately reported to the First Branch Bureau and telegraphed Tiezong and the Japanese Consulate. At this time, Japanese student Takahashi Kenichi led more than a dozen people including Takeda Yoshijutsu, Hayashida Takeshi, and Hayashida Kiyoshi, and forcibly broke into the office, overturning all the indoor equipment and making a mess. Fortunately, Sun Bingxian, the director of the First Branch Bureau, and patrol officer Shi Zhengfa of the relevant branch station rushed to the scene with police, and the Japanese Consulate also sent a staff member, Hirayama Isamu, with two Japanese police officers to the scene to help. They first persuaded more than a hundred Chinese and Japanese students to disperse, and finally prevented a major disaster from occurring. Director Sun also took Japanese student Takahashi Kenichi and Tiezong student Liu Zhende to the bureau for detailed questioning. In addition to sending the injured students and police to the Pujji Hospital for treatment, the Public Security Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to negotiate with the Japanese Consul. It is heard that Tiezong has also reported the above situation in detail to the Jiaoji Railway Education Committee to make a serious protest to the Japanese side. (October 27)</p>

<p>He Jian Urgently Transfers Various Armies to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence, the communist chieftains He Long and Kuang Jixun and their tens of thousands of followers are causing havoc in the Nanhua Bay An of Hunan Province and the Gongshi Jianli area of Hubei Province. Although the troops of Hunan and Hubei provinces have repeatedly suppressed them, they are always striking here and fleeing there, and their power is growing daily. They once captured Nanhua and occupied Gongshi twice. The people on the borders of the two provinces are suffering greatly. Recently, Hubei Province dispatched Lai Xinhui, Li Yunlong, and others to Gongshi Jianli to carry out a large-scale suppression. However, the Nanhua area of Hunan Province is guarded by local militias and no large army is stationed there. He and Kuang took advantage of the emptiness on the 21st and entered Hunan from Shishou County, attacking Nanhua in two routes. Kuang's bandits attacked Nanxian from Yu. He's bandits attacked Huarong from Xiankou. The local defense force was weak and could not resist. Nanhua and Nanxian were captured simultaneously at noon on the 22nd. The county magistrates and local defense forces of the two counties retreated to the Babai Gong area and telegraphed the province for help. Nanhua was originally the richest area in the lake area and the central hub of the lake area. With Nanhua captured, Changde, Hanshou, Yuanjiang, and Anxiang were shaken, and they also telegraphed the province to request troops to suppress them. He Jian arrived in the province by plane from Hankou at 10:00 AM on the 24th. After receiving the urgent report, he immediately transferred troops to block and suppress them in separate routes: (1) Telegraph to Director He of Hankou to send a large army to block and intercept in the Shishou and Gong'an areas on the border of Hubei, and order the Lai Xinhui's Zhang Ying division, which is currently arriving in Anxiang, Hunan, to attack Nanxian; (2) Telegraph to Chen Quzhen, the first garrison commander, to send two regiments of troops to attack Huarong along the lake from Jinshi; (3) Telegraph to Dai Huiyuan, the commander of the suppression of bandits in western Hunan, to transfer troops to attack Nanhua from Changde; (4) Telegraph to the county magistrates of Yuanjiang and Hanshou to quickly gather local militias to flank and attack Nanhua. The above-mentioned troops will arrive by about the 26th, and it is expected that the bandits will be repelled without difficulty.</p>

<h3>Reconstruction of the Northeast Airfield Implemented</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Northeast Aviation Command's airfield, originally located near the Dongta Arsenal in Shenyang, has a total area of only about 700 meters east-west and only 500 meters north-south. Besides the hangars and factories, the remaining open space is too small and insufficient. Furthermore, the airfield is located near the arsenal's ammunition storage, and prolonged testing and engine noise can easily cause danger. In 1925, the former Aviation Office requested relocation to Beiling (North Tomb), but due to military exigencies and limited funds, it was not considered. This spring, the authorities resumed the previous proposal and actively proceeded with it, sending personnel to survey the wasteland of Beiling. It is estimated that the occupied civilian land includes areas of Sandaizi, Tianyitun, Guanyintun, Waziyao, Mamafen, and Baodaotun, totaling over 7,000 mu (approximately 1155 acres), of which over 1,000 mu are government land. The remaining civilian land has been evaluated by the Provincial Government upon consultation with the Chief Executive's Office, instructing Shenyang County to cooperate with the Aviation Command to assess the price for reporting, divided into three grades (120 yuan, 100 yuan, and 90 yuan per mu). Currently, the surveying and valuation matters have been completed and are awaiting pricing and purchasing. As for the surveyed site, it occupies 2,000 meters in each direction, calculated by surveying rope, about 900 bows on each side. Boundaries have been firmly established. It is planned to plant saplings around the perimeter to delineate the boundaries in the future. The construction of the airfield is said to commence in the spring of next year. All hangars, factories, and residential areas for office personnel will be built outside the airfield area. The Aviation Command dispatched Chief of Staff Yang Fengchun and the Shenyang County Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang Detang on the 22nd to conduct an inspection in order to plan everything. (October 24th)</p>
<h3>Two Warships to Be Built for Northeast River Defense</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: It has been decided that the Northeast River Defense Fleet will have two warships built by the Northeast Shipbuilding Yard, with 300,000 silver dollars paid by the Northeast Navigation Bureau and the Northeast Navy River Transportation Office in three installments over three years. The shipyard has already received the blueprints and started work on the 16th of this month, first creating a model to be sent to the Navy Headquarters for review. The engines and boilers for both ships will be reused from old vessels. The displacement is set at 450 tons, the length is 180 feet, the height is 4 feet, the width is 30 feet, and the draft is 2 feet, making them larger and faster than the Lishui, Suisui, and Lijie ships. The armor plating will be 1.5 inches thick, the gun positions are set at four, and they will have a double-wheel stern. They will burn coal. The construction period is estimated at ten months, and it is expected to be completed around July of next year. As for the old warships Lijie and Jiangping, although they have been towed back to Harbin, they are irreparably damaged. Repairs are estimated to cost at least 300,000 yuan. Because the budget has not been finalized, they have not been repaired yet. The Jiangtai and Jiang'an ships have been towed to the dock for dismantling, and their parts will be used to supplement the new ships' needs. The Jiangheng and Lichuan are being salvaged in Fujin, but they have not yet been recovered due to the deep and fast-flowing waters there. The budget for the Northeast River Defense Fleet has changed several times, but the lack of funds in the Northeast has prevented ideal implementation. The Northeast Border Defense Command previously promised to allocate 1.5 million to add four ships, but due to the invasion of North China, which required huge amounts of money, the proposal was abandoned. Shen Honglie felt that the river defense fleet had only four incomplete ships, so he felt limited in strength both internally and externally. Thus, the Navigation Bureau and River Transportation Department devised a plan to add two ships. Considering the budget is only 300,000 yuan, one can know the capability of the new ships.

<p>Local Dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Oil Press Owner's Wife and Daughter Safe Return Home. Zhao Xichang's family, who used to run an oil press in Hujiaqiao, Punan, was previously kidnapped and suffered heavy losses, so the oil press had to close. On the 26th of last month, his sister Daguang was engaged and accompanied her mother, Madam Qin, to Songjiang to shop. The boat encountered pirates near Majing Port who pretended to inspect the cabin and abducted Madam Qin and her daughter along with their luggage and cash and fled. Her son, Xichang, being without money, did not seek assistance from various parties. He was rescued by the 4th Anti-Smuggling Squad Captain Pan Baozhong and Squad Leader Sheng, who sent Madam Qin and her daughter home by ship. However, the kidnappers have disappeared.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Additional 20% Housing Tax. The county Public Security Bureau's expenses are short by 131.5 yuan per month. The county previously ordered the First District Office to raise funds. The district replied that the housing tax revenue was insufficient. The county government then discussed methods of compensation at the last county administration meeting, resolving to order the First District Office to add 20% to the housing tax per household from October to compensate. The district's Housing and Police Tax Organization Committee discussed this at its ninth meeting. They believed that the Public Security Bureau was a county-wide matter and could not be borne by one district. Furthermore, the district's housing and police tax had recently been reorganized, and in May of this year, a special tax was levied for one month to repair the Public Security Bureau's buildings. At that time, merchants were repeatedly assured that there would be no further increases for the time being. Therefore, it was inconvenient to go back on their word. It was decided to have the district office reply to the county order to add 20%. It is expected that the county government will have to find other means of compensation.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case in Jiashan Uncovered in Shanghai. According to a tip-off to the County Public Security Bureau about a kidnapping case, the detective Yang Shijie was secretly dispatched to Shanghai. Arriving at the address, he found a hostage named Wei Erguan, the 13-year-old son of Wei Zhangsheng of Weijialou, Li Ze Town, Jiashan, at the Chunjiang Inn behind the Great World in the French Concession. A kidnapper named Xie Aliuli was also captured in Taozhuang, Jiashan. He has been escorted back to the Public Security Bureau and will be transferred to the County Government's Anti-Banditry Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Qixin's Bankruptcy Requires Investigation of Assets for Compensation. Qixin Sauce Garden in front of the Yue Temple went bankrupt last year due to losses. The creditors' lawsuit has not yet been resolved. The County Court has determined that there are many depositors and the bankruptcy involves a large amount of over 40,000 yuan. It has decided to send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce Chairman Cai Zhongyu, the Songjiang Bank Manager Xie Liangda, and the Shengyuan Trading Company Manager Tao Yisun to investigate the assets for proportionate compensation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Investigate Road Damage on Yangyao Route. The section from Tingzi Bridge outside the East Gate to Yangyao outside the South Gate is an important thoroughfare for vehicles traveling north-south outside the city. Three years ago, when the privately established Wuxi Middle School first opened, it funded the road construction, allowing vehicles to pass without hindrance. However, recently, the side near the river has been privately damaged and used for planting vegetables by the Jiangbei Shantytown residents. The other side has been arbitrarily occupied and excavated for soil by nearby residents, resulting in a narrow road that is not only unable to allow vehicle crossings but is also very dangerous for pedestrians. Yesterday, the privately established Xizhong School sent a letter to the Municipal Engineering Office requesting a swift stop and restoration to the specified width according to the City Office's regulations. The City Engineering Office has approved the letter and forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau for strict enforcement and thorough investigation of the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Detention of Wounded Soldier Attempting to Rape Female Worker. There is a female worker named Liu Suzhen in a workshop outside the West Gate of Xiyi. She is young and beautiful. Unexpectedly, a wounded soldier saw her charm the other day and was immediately aroused. He broke into the workshop and threatened her in every way, intending to rape her. At that moment, Suzhen's brother, Liu Dexin, returned home from the outside and was greatly angered. He immediately stepped forward and twisted the wounded soldier into the jurisdiction of the 4th Public Security Bureau. The branch director, Zhu Niansheng, opened the court for preliminary interrogation. The wounded soldier gave his name as Zou Chuanyang. Director Zhu took the confession and, considering that the case involved a wounded soldier forcing rape, he could not handle it himself. He sent both parties to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yesterday, the 22nd Rear Hospital in Huishan Town learned of this and brought Zou Chuanyang back for trial.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>All Five District Chiefs Dismissed. Wuyi County Government previously followed orders regarding the training of district chiefs and assistants with poor performance. The district chiefs to be trained include Bao Zongtang, He Bingyi, Huang Gongwang, Wang Qingtong, and Xu Xihua. They were required to report to the province by August 15th. Bao Zongtang and others failed to report to class on time. The Civil Affairs Department, considering that the district chiefs disobeyed orders and voluntarily abandoned their positions, specially ordered County Magistrate Wu to dismiss them all and cancel their qualifications as district chiefs as a punishment. County Magistrate Wu followed the order on the 28th and is currently selecting replacements.</p>
<p>Convict Chen Yuncai Sentenced to Death. On July 29th of this year, Cuiqiao Town in Wuyi County was plundered by bandits, who surrounded a sub-station of the 10th Public Security Bureau, killed sentry He Liansheng, and looted six firearms. The ringleader Chen Yuncai was captured by the Water Police Team. The District Chief Mao transferred him to the Wujin County Court for interrogation. The investigation confirmed him as the main culprit. It has been heard that he has been sentenced to death in accordance with the regulations for punishing bandits.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Zhu Nan Will Be Sentenced by Military Law. Zhu Xingnan from Xiagang was arrested in Suzhou last month for being involved in a communist case. He used the alias Wang Chuntao. His concubine, Shen Yunzhen, used the alias Wu Qingxi (already sentenced to ten months in prison by the High Court). After Zhu Xingnan was escorted to the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command, he was then escorted to the Zhenjiang Provincial Security Office. After being interrogated once by Ban Dechang, a staff member of the Second Division and Third Unit of the Provincial School, he was detained in the County Court detention center. Regarding how to handle the case, it is heard that it will be transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Temporary Military Law Joint Trial for processing.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Provincial Security Regiment Searches for Remnant Bandits Along the Coast. The Yanfu area of Jiangbei has been disturbed by Ma Ren's bandit army. Ma calls himself the commander-in-chief of the Pseudo-Punitive 16th Route Army and commander of the 27th Army. The army is said to have four divisions. After the Provincial Security Regiment advanced to suppress them, Ma's army collapsed within a week, rescuing over 200 kidnapped men and women. The regiment is now searching for remnant bandits along the coast in multiple routes and is working with local authorities to handle the aftermath. They are also dispatching teams to protect various salt reclamation companies in collecting crops.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Wu Boying Escapes from Bandits and Returns. Liu Shouquan, a wealthy merchant in Xitang Bridge, was kidnapped by bandits a few days ago and extorted for ransom. At the same time, Wu Boying, the owner of a timber business in Xieqiao, was also kidnapped. It is now known that Wu Boying has safely returned. He stated that one night, a large gang of bandits went out to rob, and the two guards were negligent. They drank and fell asleep. Taking advantage of their unpreparedness, he broke down the door and escaped. A certain agency in the urban area learned of this and has sent people to inquire about everything in order to find ways to rescue Liu Shouquan.</p>

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Wang Meichu of Songjiang</h3>
<p>On the 27th, I saw in your newspaper's letter column that Ye Zonglian, the owner of Tai Shun Yuan Rice Store, stated in his letter that I am still working in the store, which does not conform to the facts reported in your newspaper. Meichu has suffered terrible oppression and humiliation, which is more than what was stated in your newspaper's dispatch on the 26th. I was forced to leave the store and originally intended to commit suicide. However, because my parents are still alive and I have not fulfilled my duty as a son, and after being persuaded by my fellow apprentices and brothers who searched and found me, I reluctantly returned to the store that evening. My master had already gone to Shanghai to find me. When the store received the news that I had been found, they reported it to the owner in Shanghai, who was furious. He immediately sent a letter to the original introducer, stating that I had been dismissed and urging him to come and take me back. How could I endure his repeated oppression? The news reported in your newspaper on the 26th is all true. Therefore, I make a special statement and ask that it be published in the letter column so that everyone knows my difficult situation. Then, I will be forever grateful. Respectfully, Wang Meichu, October 29th.</p>

<h3>Appeal from Teachers and Staff of Various Middle Schools in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>| Please issue the August and September salaries by the end of this month |</p>
<p>| The Department Director-General Doesn't Need to Be So Arrogant |</p>
<p>| The Salary Management Office Is Occupying a Useless Position |</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial United Association of Teachers and Staff of Provincial Middle Schools declares regarding salary arrears: To all sectors of Jiangsu Province, paternal elders, and fellow citizens: We have endured economic oppression and suffered hardships, with unexpressed grievances for a long time. Now, we can no longer bear it and are about to make a solemn statement. We dare to first share our situation with you, our paternal elders. We have heard that education is the foundation of a nation, the key to its rise and fall, and the cause of order and chaos. Civilized countries around the world, even during times of war, strive to maintain the continuity of teaching. China is unfortunate, with successive disasters. Fortunately, Jiangsu is not a war zone, and schools have not been forced to close. Although we feel that the treatment is not generous and the living conditions are difficult, the burden is heavy, and the work is arduous, we feel that our responsibilities are greater due to the national crisis. We work diligently in teaching and never disobey. We guide and help tirelessly, without seeking comfort. This is to repay the country, inform our paternal elders, comfort the students, and be true to our conscience. Unexpectedly, nearly three months have passed since the beginning of this academic year, and the education funds have not yet been issued. Principals have no means to raise funds and appeal to the authorities. However, the Education Department turns a deaf ear, and the Salary Management Office deliberately obstructs. We deeply understand the difficulties of the times and work on an empty stomach. Even though we are full of wounds and holes, we remain silent. This should be well understood by our paternal elders. However, the salary arrears are increasing day by day, and our suffering is deepening. The cost of living is high, and everything is expensive. Credit is tight, and borrowing is impossible. The funds for supporting our families are essential and cannot be lacking even for a day. As a result, we are willing to serve the public but unable to support our families. If we do not seek other means of survival, we will inevitably sit and wait for death. This is unbearable. Now, the whole province has a great harvest, and everyone is celebrating. The military affairs have ended, and people's lives are stable. The source of education funds is not exhausted. False statements about shortages are aimed at deceiving whom? This is unbearable. The prosperity of education values both talent and resources. Without talent, how can the effect of cultivating talent be achieved? Without resources, it is even more difficult to maintain the function of education. The education officer of a province should recruit talent and entrust them with school administration. They should also plan the economy and avoid hindering progress. However, Director Chen sits high in the hall, and the situation below cannot be conveyed. There are often cases where he refuses to see petitioners, and even more often, he does not approve petitions. He only seeks peace for his ears and does not care about the suffering of the poor scholars. His official demeanor is more than enough, and education is on the verge of bankruptcy. One person's celebration causes worry for the whole province. We are concerned about the future, and our hearts are extremely hurt. This is unbearable. Our Jiangsu education was independent the earliest. Special commissioners were set up for management, and there should be no major problems. Unfortunately, the reception and dispatch of funds are not handled by the right people. As a result, there are many dark secrets, and the economy has not been made public. It takes a lot of effort to investigate and clarify. In the past, when it came to issuing funds on time, there were often delays and suppressions, and some deliberately made things difficult. What is their motive? It is unfathomable. After the start of this academic year, they disregarded the difficulties of the schools and withheld funds, claiming that there was a shortfall. Who can believe such absurd words? Even if it is not false, then what is the duty of these officials? Failure to urge collection is also an inescapable responsibility. If there are many obstacles and collection is indeed difficult, they should step aside and let others take their place. How can they occupy a useless position and cause disaster to Jiangsu? All of this is perplexing and even more strange. The salaries of the officials in the Salary Management Office are issued every half a month. Why are they so loyal to themselves and treat themselves so well? Is there really no one in Jiangsu? This is unbearable. In summary, it is difficult to remain silent. It has been resolved at the 7th Representative Conference of our association that, in addition to submitting a request to the Education Department to order the Salary Management Office to issue the August and September salaries in full by the end of this month, otherwise we will take serious action. We specially state our difficulties and make a solemn declaration. We respectfully ask for your understanding. October 20, 1930.</p>
<h3>Central University Faculty Requests President Zhang to Return to School</h3>
<p>Central University Faculty Telegraphically Requests President Zhang to Return to School: President Zhang, Jianzhen, Hongqingli, Wuding Road, Shanghai. Your efforts to improve the school's affairs have pleased the whole school. Your great plans will soon become a reality. However, you have suddenly had the thought of resigning, greatly betraying your original intention. The opportunity for improvement has been suspended. We hope that you will prioritize the school and return to school immediately to take charge of the overall plan. We eagerly await your return. Faculty of National Central University: Chen Kuifu, Ni Shangda, Pan Shu, Guo Yiqin, Zhang Yuche, Lu Zhihong, Fan Huiguo, Zhang Zhenqian, Wang Can, Zhang Zhengping, Chen Guangqing, Hao Song, Ni Kequan, Zhou Xueou, Zhuang Cheng, Ni Zexun, Zheng Lanhua, Wang Suzhen, Liang Zhaochun, Wu Shaoxi, Xie Pengnian, Zheng Xuedian, Zhu Zhengyuan, Zhong Xinghou, Ning Qinming, Li Xiujun, Zhang Tao, Zhang Fuyan, Xia Baduo, Zhao Lianfang, Zhang Mingshan, Tang Wentong, Ye Shengzhong, Sun Qingbo, Xu Zongdai, Zhou Shilu, Wang Zuoqing, Zhao Yan, Yu Jieshi, Zhang Kaiqi, Cao Siyu, Zhang Chen Nie, Rong Zao, Li Chulin, Xu Xie, Pu Qicun, Shen Qingnang, Chen Hao, Zhou Zhaofeng, Yuan Jianqi, Li Wuquan, Yang Xiao, Jin Yunwen, Yao Gongshu, Hu Jianmin, Tang Hongzhu, Yu Xinzuo, Zheng Jiajun, Liu Yunshan, Wang Baoren, Zhang Yizun, Luo Zexu, et al.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Qualification for Graduation from Training Institutes</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on the report submitted by Chen Yuqi of the Lianhehui (United Association) of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff in An County, Fujian, stated that in the 8th year of the Republic (1919), the Beijing Ministry of Interior established the Local Autonomy Model Training Institute in the capital to prepare for local autonomy. The Ministry of Interior sent a directive to the highest administrative officials in each province and region to select qualified personnel to attend the institute. According to Article 2 of the institute's charter, students must meet the following requirements: (1) Be at least 30 years old; (2) Have graduated from a law and political school for at least one and a half years, or have a background as a Juren (successful candidate in the imperial provincial exams) or Gongshi (successful candidate in the imperial palace exams) or above in the Qing Dynasty, or have held a substantive position equivalent to a recommended or appointed official; (3) Have at least two years of experience in handling local public welfare undertakings; (4) Have not been subject to criminal punishment or declared bankrupt. What kind of school can this training institute be compared to? What kind of qualification does its graduation entail? Is it equivalent to the level of secondary schools? These matters concern qualification issues. The director requests a clear explanation. The Ministry of Education replied: The report has been received. This training institute was originally established to meet a temporary need and is not within the scope of the academic system. It is difficult to compare it to various formal schools, and the qualifications of its graduates cannot be equivalent to those of secondary school graduates. Furthermore, the organization of the Lianhehui of primary and secondary school teachers and staff lacks a legal basis. If the members of the association aim to study education matters and develop local education, they should join the county education association if it has been established. Otherwise, they should submit a request to the county education bureau to organize a county education association in accordance with the regulations of the education association. Please comply accordingly.</p>

<h3>Beijing Academic Society Temporarily Suspends Lectures</h3>

<h3>Social Education Inspectors Visit Songhu for Inspection</h3>

<h3>The Zhejiang Alumni Association of China Public School Supports Li and Yan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Alumni Association of China Public School in Wusong has organized a support association for students Li and Yan, who were expelled from school, and issued a declaration stating: Our school is unfortunate and incidents have occurred repeatedly. On the evening of the 14th of this month, a meeting of the Department of Political Economy was disrupted by a small number of students who assaulted the chairman, leading to the emergency intervention of the Eighth District Party Headquarters, which dispatched troops to the school to search and arrest students, seriously affecting the safety of the school. Principal Ma failed to take adequate precautions beforehand and, after the fact, listened only to one side of the story, falsely accusing students Li Xiong and Yan Jingzhao of privately reporting to the military, resulting in their expulsion. However, the perpetrators who caused the disturbance were allowed to attend classes without consequence. Is this fair and just? The actions of a small number of students who caused the disturbance is one matter, while the military's search and arrest of students is another. The former falls within the administrative scope of the school, and Principal Ma should handle it impartially and take appropriate action. The latter involves the Party Headquarters, and Principal Ma should consult with the Party Headquarters and handle it properly to avoid escalating the incident. However, Principal Ma did not do this and instead deliberately showed favoritism, which aroused public anger and offended the Party. The escalation of this incident can be traced back to Principal Ma, who is undoubtedly responsible. Now that the incident has escalated and the situation has suddenly become serious, it is no longer just a matter of inappropriate internal measures but has turned into a matter of offending the Party externally. The school's future is fraught with crises, and all students sincerely hope that Principal Ma will find a solution to this matter. However, Principal Ma suddenly left the school on the pretext of illness at this critical juncture, with a bizarre and unpredictable attitude. We and other colleagues, out of love for the school and our fellow students, are unwilling to lag behind in clarifying the truth and upholding justice. In order to save the school and quell the turmoil, we have requested the school authorities to reinstate students Li and Yan in order to appease the people and resolve the matter. We also hope to unite our efforts and reverse the situation. Only by achieving this goal can we face the wrongly accused students Li and Yan, and only then can we show our sincere love for the school. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

Based on the experience gained over the years, it was revised again and put into print in early this month. It has now been completed and is on sale. The price is low, only one dime per copy. Those who want to know the new rules of small football must have it.</p>
<p>[P The Chinese Sports Association Independently Reviews the Expedition Team Members</p>
<p>丨Resolution of Last Night's Board Meeting丨No Cooperation with Western Football Association丨</p>
<p>Regarding the eligibility of players on the expeditionary football team, after the Hong Kong Football Association revoked the eligibility of Chen Guangyao and Cao Guicheng, Shanghai also responded. Previously, the Western Football Association proposed the establishment of a special committee to review the eligibility of players participating in the expeditionary team. The committee was to be composed of two members appointed by the Western Association, two members appointed by the Chinese National Sports Promotion Association, and another person unrelated to both parties, who was agreed upon by both parties. Recently, the Western Association has appointed two members, but the Chinese National Sports Promotion Association resolved at last night's board meeting that it would not cooperate with the Western Association and would independently form a committee to review the matter, which will be discussed at a closed meeting in the near future.</p>

<h3>Members of the Chamber of Commerce Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Members to Go to Beijing in Batches</p>
<p>Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Visiting Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, invited members and experts from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to hold a discussion meeting at the Bank Club on the sixth floor of No. 4 Hong Kong Road at 2 pm yesterday. Over fifty people attended including Ye Fuxiao, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Zeqing, Hu Shuhua, Ye Huijun, Lin Kanghou, Li Fuxun, Pan Xulun, Xu Yongzuo, Li Quanshi, Fang Jiaobo, Lao Jingxiu, Rong Zongjing, Wu Yunweng, Zhang Zilian, Lu Zhixue, Wang Yiting, Zhu Yinjiang, Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Wanqing, Lu Chengzhang, Tang Jishan, Shi Boan, etc. Chaired by Zhao Jinqing, the chairman first reported the purpose of today's meeting: (1) There are as many as 400 proposals for this chamber of commerce meeting, but the meeting period is only eight days. All proposals will inevitably be merged. It is hoped that you will express your opinions in the discussion meeting and make thorough and adequate preparations so as not to become paper articles. (2) Pay special attention to the proposals that are important and easy to implement. (3) Please determine the time of your departure at this time so as to negotiate with the Ministry of Railways and add vehicles on time. Next, the members decided to go to Beijing in four batches. The first batch was scheduled to leave Shanghai on the night train on the 30th, the second batch was scheduled to leave on the fast morning train at 9 am on the 31st, and the third batch was scheduled to leave on the fast night train on the 31st. The fourth batch plans to take the new plane from the United States to China, but the plane is currently being refueled. If it is not enough time, it will join the third batch and depart together. Then, Zhang Zilian proposed to ask the chairman to send a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, listing all the proposals separately in the agenda so that there would be sufficient preparation and time could be saved. The chairman agreed to do so. Then, Lu Chengzhang proposed to first total the proposals and then discuss them in groups, and then make a general report after the meeting is closed. Everyone agreed. Next, the chairman read aloud the main points of each proposal: (1) Matters concerning national unemployment relief; (2) Matters concerning industrial relief; (3) Matters concerning international trade; (4) Matters concerning industrial and commercial finance; (5) Matters concerning centralized capital and the use of foreign capital to develop industry; (6) Matters concerning labor welfare and labor-capital disputes; (7) Matters concerning scientific management; (8) Matters concerning commercial tax; (9) Matters concerning industrial raw materials; (10) Matters concerning advocating and protecting domestic products; (11) Matters concerning the improvement of inherent products; (12) Matters concerning basic industry, totaling twelve items. If you have any opinions, you may wish to express them here and notify the ministry first. Then, Zhang Zilian proposed that, in view of the current situation, the proposal that can solve the first matter is to promote domestic products. Therefore, this seat believes that the discussion of the tenth matter proposal should be given special attention. Finally, it was said that the conference should seriously review the proposal itself and not be prejudiced because of the proposer's reputation. Next, Li Quanshi proposed to ask the chairman to telegraph the registration list to the reception office of the conference in advance for contact. The chairman agreed to do so. Next, Xu Jiqing proposed that the suggestions of the members should focus on what is important and easy to implement, and not just sing high tunes. Next, Qian Xinzhi and Pan Xulun successively spoke, requesting the chairman to telegraph Director Zhang of the Secretariat of the Conference and to absolutely refuse entertainment after arriving in Beijing, so as to save time and concentrate on the discussion of the agenda. At most, the conference and the various places outside the conference should be combined for one entertainment, and all others should be rejected. Next, Lin Kanghou reported that Rong Zongjing's temporary proposal was to promote the establishment of a commercial arbitration office as soon as possible, so that merchants' disputes could be resolved by the arbitration office in a few words without legal procedures and spending a long time. Next, Lu Chengzhang asked whether the conference badges would be issued in Shanghai or in Beijing. The chairman replied that they would be issued in Beijing. Next, the chairman declared that the conference would open at 11 am on November 1. If you are leaving Shanghai on the night train on the 31st, please arrive at the station around 10 o'clock so that the greeters can easily greet you. Otherwise, time will be tight and there may be delays. Next, tea and snacks were served and the meeting adjourned at 4 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Proposals from Various Parties at the Industry and Commerce Conference</h3>
<p>Ren Jinpin Requests the Establishment of a National Products Award Bureau. Many proposals were made by various parties at this National Industry and Commerce Conference. Key points are extracted and recorded below:</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai (1) Regarding unemployment relief, adopt protective policies, order existing factories not to experience shutdowns or strikes, investigate when factories experience slow sales, and provide government guarantees. Also, encourage the establishment of simple factories to accommodate unemployed workers. (1) Regarding industrial relief, (1) domestically produced cotton should be granted reduced tax rates to facilitate mutual sales. Woven fabrics should especially have taxes reduced to promote sales, emphasizing domestic products. (2) When unavoidable, the tax rate on imported foreign cotton should also be reduced to broadly receive foreign cotton. However, clear regulations should be established to limit this practice, preventing textile factories from closing due to cotton shortages. (1) Regarding industrial relief and international trade, compile and publish annual statistics listing which exported goods are the most prominent to awaken industry and commerce. Pay special attention to which raw materials are processed into finished goods for sale in our country. It is common for domestic products to be transformed into foreign goods. If a fundamental plan can be made to address this issue, starting with a specific product as an experiment and gradually implementing it over the years, the great detriment of exporting raw materials and importing finished goods can be eliminated, not only plugging loopholes but also encouraging industry. (1) Regarding industrial and commercial finance, our country's finance is now centered on banks. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance should urgently determine the operational areas of each bank, establish regulations, and restrict them from concurrently operating in other industries to align with the true meaning of commerce. (1) Regarding basic industries, expanding provincial roads and developing transportation is a major part of promoting the late Premier's industrial plan. In recent times, many provinces have followed suit. With provincial roads completed, the necessary gasoline and tires are all supplied from abroad. As road administration expands, the import of foreign goods increases. If there is a shortage, transportation will be hindered. The extraction, mining, and refining of our country's oil to supply this essential use is important. Special attention should be paid to this issue, and plans should be made in advance. Not only should the mining and refining of oil not be delayed, but also the purchase and transportation of rubber and the special establishment of factories to imitate tire production is also an important industry. "There are two other jointly proposed items not recorded."</p>
<p>Ren Jinpin. The original site of the old Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road, since being leased by Zhang Zilian and opened as a National Products Joint Emporium, has aroused public sympathy. Recently, the emporium has adopted the "National Products Business Development Plan" proposed by Ren Jinpin and is implementing it in an orderly manner. The departmental organization of the emporium is nearing completion, and large quantities of domestic goods have been purchased for each department. The entire emporium is full of spirit. Commercial leaders Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai and others express sympathy for Zhang's efforts to fight for national products. Therefore, Ren's "Suggestion for the Government to Establish a National Products Promotion and Award Bureau," submitted to this National Industry and Commerce Conference, has been signed and introduced. The original text is appended below.</p>
<p>Suggestion for the Government to Establish a National Products Promotion and Award Bureau. "Purpose" Implement Article 2 of the National Founding Outline established by the late Premier to enable the government and the people to jointly build the people's livelihood. Adopt methods of awarding national products to encourage commercial organizations specializing in selling national products (such as emporiums and companies) to resist the development of international commerce and realize the fulfillment of the four major needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation for the people of the country. "Reason" Interpretation of the Premier's Testament. Article 2 of the Premier's National Founding Outline states: (The most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood. Therefore, for the four major needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation for the people of the country, the government should work with the people to jointly develop agriculture to provide sufficient food, jointly develop weaving to enrich clothing, build various types of houses according to grand plans to provide comfortable housing, and repair roads to facilitate transportation). Is the Premier's intention that the government gather the financial resources of the entire country and have 100 million people weave clothes, 100 million people farm the land, 100 million people build houses, and 100 million people build roads to assist and jointly pursue the welfare of clothing, food, housing, and transportation? This is not the Premier's intention. The Premier's intention is to have the people progress from self-reliance to joint efforts, helping those who help themselves, and supplementing the efforts of joint assistance with the power of the government. Therefore, the initial impetus lies with the people, not with the government. For the people, the first thing is to first exhaust their individual abilities to seek the completion of their individual clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and then seek the completion of their family's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Secondly, those who have completed their clothing, food, housing, and transportation should seek the comfort of their clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and then help those who have not completed their clothing, food, housing, and transportation to complete it again. Thirdly, those who have quick remedies for clothing, food, housing, and transportation should further help those who are uncomfortable with clothing, food, housing, and transportation to become comfortable and help others who have not completed their clothing, food, housing, and transportation to complete it entirely. "Current Economic Phenomena and Future Perils." Looking around the country today, there are people who have happiness in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, people who have comfort in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and people who do not have complete clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Then, based on the previous statement, one must assume that those who do not have complete clothing, food, housing, and transportation will soon be able to complete it entirely. This cannot be done daily. Not only will those who do not have complete clothing, food, housing, and transportation not be able to fully complete it, but those who currently have happiness and comfort in clothing, food, housing, and transportation will gradually lose their happiness and comfort and fall into a state of incompleteness. Why do I say this? The completeness of clothing, food, housing, and transportation depends on the production of agricultural and industrial capabilities and the operation of agricultural and industrial capabilities. Promoting agricultural and industrial capabilities for production and operation depends on economic assistance. Without economic assistance, even with agricultural and industrial strength, nothing can be done. Then, what is the current economic phenomenon in China? It is being invaded by foreign commercial policies, with an annual export of 140 million taels, which is nearly 4 million taels per day. Even if it does not increase any further, the total export amount after ten years will be 1.4 billion taels, and the total export amount after two hundred years will be 14 billion taels. Then, the 400 million people of China must each sacrifice their abilities to contribute 35 taels or 350 taels of harvest to foreigners each year in addition to seeking their own livelihoods. I ask, what will be the economic phenomenon in China be like after ten or one hundred years? I am afraid it cannot be asked. Taking a step back, today's economic phenomena in China include unopened mines, uncultivated fields, and unbuilt forests. There are also fields that have been planted but are barren due to a lack of farmers. This is not because China lacks farmers and workers, but because there is a lack of sufficient economy to promote China's agricultural and industrial capabilities to supply the application of opening mines, cultivating fields, and building forests. "The Importance of Implementing Commercial Policies." Therefore, if China wants to enable the 400 million people to fully enjoy the completeness, comfort, and even happiness of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it must organize resistance to the invasion of foreign economy in commerce. The current era has entered an era of commercial warfare. People are using commercial policies to plot against us daily, and we cannot but use commercial policies to respond to them. Among the organizations of the so-called commercial policies, the most important principle is to enable the nation's merchants to jointly develop foreign trade. Only when foreign trade can develop can domestic industry and domestic agriculture rise. Therefore, in China, where the economy is backward, agriculture and industry are unemployed, foreign goods are abundant, and mines, fields, and forests are abandoned, it is especially necessary to implement commercial policies to seek economic relief and enable the people to enjoy the welfare of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. (Reforming Commercial Organizations and Commercial Policies). We already know that China wants to seek economic relief and enable the people to enjoy the welfare of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and it is necessary to implement commercial policies. Then, how will the organization of its policies begin? Will the merchants of the country unite to organize it together? Today's Chinese merchants are insufficient to speak of commercial policies. The main work of commercial policies has two major aspects: domestic and foreign. Today's Chinese merchants have long been tempted by the benefits of other countries' commercial policies towards us, and most sell goods from other countries and become organizations that promote foreign commercial policies. It is impossible to expect them to develop foreign commercial policies, and it is also impossible to expect them to work hard for domestic commercial policies. Therefore, we already know the importance of implementing commercial policies, and if we want to plan the progress of commercial policies, we must start by reforming the existing bad commercial organizations. If we want to reform the existing bad commercial organizations, we must engage in the collection of the nation's consumption power and jointly assist commercial organizations that fully promote domestic goods to create a new organization of Chinese commerce. Only then can commercial policies be spoken of. (National Goods Award Bureau and National Goods Stores). If the above-mentioned new organization of commerce can further expand, then it will be seen that all the streets and markets in the country are stores that promote national goods, and there will be no trace of foreign goods in circulation. Then, national goods will increase and develop daily, and agricultural and industrial enterprises will be able to progress together. In this way, the domestic purpose of commercial policies can be fully realized, and then foreign development can be sought. Or if it is said that it can indeed be done according to the aforementioned procedures to achieve the domestic goal of commercial policies, then what techniques will be used to create this new organization of commerce and achieve the so-called domestic goal of commercial policies? It is necessary to devote all efforts to the implementation of the poorly drafted National Products Business Development Plan (see the plan book for details). If this plan can be unimpeded, effective, and the government can find ways to promote the National Products Award Bureau as a strong incentive, then like a tiger and a dragon, the rise of national goods stores will be like spring shoots after rain, and the smooth sale of national goods and the development of agriculture, industry, and hundreds of industries will be like the circulation of the atmosphere, reaching everywhere. (Measures) (1) Imitate the regulations for encouraging afforestation, cotton cultivation, sugar making, and reclamation to award commercial organizations that fully promote national goods (commercial centers, stores, or commercial firms). (2) Imitate the regulations for encouraging overseas Chinese to invest in and establish industry and mining to award people who invest in or initiate commercial organizations that fully promote national goods. (3) Imitate the regulations for awarding inventions and crafts to reward individuals or groups who have made special achievements in promoting national goods and expressing opinions and writings on promoting national goods. (Conclusion) If this is done, then the domestic and foreign work of China's commercial policies will be able to be quickly successful by the people's efforts and the government's rewards. If the domestic work of commercial policies can be completed, then the overflowing loopholes will be plugged, the domestic economy will be prosperous, and foreign trade will also develop accordingly. At this time, continue to work hard, move the remaining strength of domestic work, and seek the direction for foreign countries so that the country's surplus production can travel across the oceans to exchange for foreign currency to plan for the completeness and comfort of the four major needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation for all the people of China. It is almost certainly the case. Li Kui'an, Standing Committee Member of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation. Li Kui'an, a standing committee member of the National Federation of Commerce, attended the National Industry and Commerce Conference and made many proposals, all of which were important. (1) It is proposed that the government establish an economic guidance organization to guide the production business as the center. (2) It is proposed to implement the recovery of inland river navigation rights. (3) Improve domestic silk to maintain the foundation of the country. (4) Maintain the foreign trade of tung oil. (5) Consolidate southwest finance. (6) Request the government to handle national industrial and commercial statistics. The measures for each of the above cases are extremely thorough. However, due to the length of the words, I cannot record them all. There are several other proposals introduced by Mr. Li. From this, it can be seen that all the attending committee members of this Industry and Commerce Conference are extremely attentive.</p>
<p>Shen Huachen. Two proposals from member Shen Huachen are recorded below. (1) Regarding the development of industry and the protection of domestic goods, it is proposed to legislate to protect domestic fledgling industries and formulate regulations to prevent mergers and taxes. It is imperative to investigate that our country's industry is fledgling, which is the root cause of weakness. If we want to survive, we must protect it with laws. Capitalists of imperialist countries exercise economic aggression and adopt merger policies to destroy our fledgling industry. I will cite two examples to prove this. (1) There are only three cement factories in our country. They are operating miserably and have been repeatedly hit. Today, the domestic construction industry is gradually increasing its need for this. However, Japan is making every effort to destroy it with a merger policy. The selling price of Japanese cement in its own country is 3 yuan and 60 sen per barrel, equivalent to about 4 taels and 7 qian in standard silver dollars. Shipping to China requires an additional shipping fee of 1 tael and 7 qian and 4 fen. The proper selling price per barrel should be 6 taels and 4 qian and 4 fen. However, it deliberately raises the price, below the cost. In May of this year, a Japanese firm sold it to the British Works Bureau for 2 taels and 5 fen, which is a clear proof. (2) The number of Swedish matches sold in China is truly astounding. The set selling price is only half of the cost. This is another proof of the merger policy. If you really want to seek strength and seek the survival of industry, you must legislate protection and implement prevention of merger and tax regulations. I humbly read the late Premier's National Founding Outline, which stated in the industrial plan that to develop China's industry, the government must protect it with laws and regulations. The glorious legacy should be a clear lesson for centuries. We should quickly enact protection laws and clearly stipulate regulations to prevent mergers and taxes to maintain our country's fledgling industry. I am extremely fortunate to present my humble views and respectfully request a decision for implementation. (2) Regarding international trade matters, it is proposed to remove the cocoon tax to reduce the cost of Chinese silk and benefit foreign trade. It is essential to maintain our country's silk industry, which occupies an important position in international trade and has a profound relationship with farmers' and workers' livelihoods. Recently, it has been manipulated by Japanese silk, suspended by European sales, and affected by sluggishness, even to the point of collapse. This is a deep fear for the future of the domestic silk industry. The most important remedy is to reduce the burden and eliminate the cocoon tax. The export of silk must be taxed, and cocoons are the raw material for silk. The cocoon tax is a heavy tax. Moreover, silk is different from other businesses. The success or failure of sales and the high or low market prices are all at the mercy of foreign merchants, and the price of purchased cocoons must be shifted according to the abundance of the year and cannot be taxed according to the silk market. Cocoon prices are too low, which will damage farmers' profits. Moreover, spring, summer, and autumn cocoon harvesting all have fixed times and cannot be estimated in advance. The price of silk sales is used to list the cost of purchasing cocoons. Other industrial products can calculate the selling price based on the cost, but the silk industry has no grasp of either. Based on this argument, eliminating the cocoon tax is the first step to remedy the silk industry. If it is said that it concerns the national budget and is not easy to change, it should be known that tariff autonomy will be implemented in January of the Republic of China in the 20th year, and a strategy of increasing income from import tariff items can be used. Please propose, and I humbly await a public decision. Proposer: Member Shen Huachen.</p>

<h3>Fei Tang Seeks Opinions from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Notice on Studying Municipal Administration of Concessions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession published the Chinese Public Bulletin yesterday, which contained Notice No. 4026 of the Municipal Council: (Regarding Mr. Fei Tang's study of the municipal conditions of the Shanghai Public Concession,) For the purpose of notice, regarding the section on Mr. Fei Tang's research on the municipal conditions of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Bureau has issued notices No. 3925 and 3940 (see the Bureau's English Public Bulletin of January 24 and February 28, 1930), requesting public groups, societies, and people from all countries to send letters to Mr. Fei to state their opinions or news. It is hereby declared again that Mr. Fei is currently writing a report. People from all walks of life are welcome to state their opinions, and Mr. Fei is very willing to consider them. However, the research will soon be completed, and these letters must be sent to Mr. Fei as soon as possible at Office No. 341 of the Bureau, or his personal secretary can receive them on his behalf. This is specially notified to all. The notice is issued by Edward, Director General.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Pay Raise Issue</h3>
<p>Can Be Resolved with Jardine Matheson</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Association yesterday (the 29th) convened representatives from the three departments of sailors, stokers, and stewards at its headquarters to discuss the method of raising salaries for Jardine Matheson seamen.  Among those present were Xu Yiliang from the Yan Ying General Agency, Wang Xinkuan from the Navigation Industry Nine Public Associations, Zhang Zaitang from the North Jun'an Public Association, Li Wen from the South Jun'an Public Association, Tang Hesheng from the Lianyi Society, Jin Cangyou, and Wang Yongsheng from the Shanghai Branch.  After customary greetings, Chairman Zhao Zhizhi reported, stating briefly that repeated negotiations regarding the pay raise for Jardine Matheson seamen had not yet yielded a satisfactory response. The company only requested Mr. Yu Qiaqing to mediate, and finally agreed to a monthly increase of four yuan per person from September 1st of this year. Whether this can be resolved in this way is still uncertain.  Because various Chinese shipping companies have already signed an agreement to first increase four yuan from August 1st of this year, and then increase another two yuan in March of next year, it seems difficult to consider this appropriate by comparison. Therefore, this meeting was called to discuss and expedite the matter. Next, Wang Yongsheng, a guiding committee member from the Shanghai Branch, stated that he had been appointed to discuss and mediate the pay raise for Jardine Matheson seamen with Mr. Yu Qiaqing.  He expressed that a pay raise of four yuan from September 1st of this year could be finalized, and requested a public decision. Subsequently, the entire assembly approved the plan and appointed Comrade Wang Yongsheng and Association Secretary Liu Yuzhou to handle it. The meeting adjourned without discussing other matters. According to the above meeting, the pay raise issue for Jardine Matheson seamen can now be resolved.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Grain Tribute Additional Levy Issue</h3>
<p>County Funds and Property Office Pleads for the People</p>
<p>Qin Xitian, director of the Shanghai County Local Public Funds and Property Management Office, yesterday submitted a document to the National Government Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance regarding the additional levy on grain tribute. The document stated: "Regarding the additional levy of two yuan on grain tribute, it has been publicly discussed to temporarily comply and pay. Please promptly issue and promulgate the Land Tax Law to uphold the political system and alleviate the people's hardship."  It further stated, "This year's additional levy of two yuan on grain tribute has been publicly announced by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance. While it can indeed alleviate the difficulties of the provincial treasury, it increases the burden on the people. There is something unavoidable in saying this. The heavy burden of land tax in the old Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang prefectures was truly compelled by the tyranny of autocracy. Now, under the banner of revolution, to imitate the abusive policies of inequality is like adding depth to water and heat to fire. This cannot be a regular method. The land tax is valued at one-hundredth of all taxes, which is the principle of the tax law. Therefore, all counties requesting to collect local fees have been rejected if they exceeded the limit. Now, regardless of the amount of the old tax, a uniform two yuan of silver per picul is levied, which is equivalent to increasing the tax by one jiao and eight fen on each mu of land. This violates the established law and cannot be a regular method. Land with grain tribute has heavy taxes, while land without grain tribute has light taxes. Now, the light ones are not increased, while the heavy ones are made heavier, which is uneven and unreasonable. This cannot be a regular method. The Department of Finance believes that the price of rice has increased, and the conversion rate should be increased accordingly. However, grain tribute is purchased, not levied. This name should not exist in the Republican era. Furthermore, in the autocratic dynasty, the discount on grain prices was limited to eight thousand, and no further increase was allowed. Therefore, warlords resorted to violent extortion and arbitrary taxes under the guise of borrowing grain tribute and dared not openly levy additional taxes. By comparing this case, it not only loses public support but also violates the political system. This cannot be a regular method.  The district chiefs of our county previously held a meeting at our office and resolved that they would make efforts to bear the expenses of the provincial treasury. However, they believe this is an expedient measure and definitely not a long-term solution. They requested our office to submit a petition to your government (yuan) (department) (廳), stating that this additional levy should still be carried out temporarily in accordance with the previous temporary additional levy for the Northern Expedition expenses. They also requested that a tax law be formulated and promulgated to various provinces according to land prices. Our office dares not withhold this information and hereby presents it for your review and instruction. This would be a virtuous and convenient act. In addition to submitting it to the National Government (Executive Yuan) (Ministry of Finance) and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, we respectfully present this document. (The following is omitted)."</p>

<h3>South Africa Oppresses Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Strive for Justice</p>
<p>In recent years, overseas Chinese have been groaning under the oppression of imperialism, with almost no place to stand. Recently, the South African Federal Government has once again excluded Chinese merchants. The City Chamber of Commerce believes that this concerns the lives of overseas Chinese merchants and has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to strive for justice. The telegram stated: "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, on the 27th of this month, we received a letter from He Zuan, the acting Consul-General in South Africa, stating that anti-Asian sentiment in the South African Federation is increasing. Recently, they have stopped issuing business licenses to Chinese, which is illegal and violates treaties. Our consulate is striving for justice. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we are sending the original text of the report to the ministry for your review." The South African Federal Government's Transvaal recruited a large number of Chinese laborers when it opened gold mines in the late Qing Dynasty for its use. Afterwards, when the mining operations ended, the miners were sent back one after another and were not allowed to stay. To this day, only merchants remain among the overseas Chinese in that country, and there are no workers. According to the general practice of the United States and Australia to exclude Chinese workers, the South African Federal Government has no excuse. However, it has gone a step further and taken the step of suspending the issuance of business licenses to Chinese merchants in order to implement its private city regulations established in 1907. This means that even a small number of Chinese merchants are not allowed to stand. Even the United States and Australia, which are the most famous for excluding people of color today, do not have such harsh measures. Although the South African Federation is an autonomous colony, it is nominally under the British Imperial Government. Therefore, the friendly and commercial treaty concluded between China and the United Kingdom must be faithfully observed by the Federal Government. This act of violating the treaty and forcing Chinese merchants to close their businesses should be protested severely by your ministry through its ambassador to the United Kingdom. It should also be stated that if the Federation has any actions to promote commerce with China in the future, China must adopt corresponding retaliatory measures before improving its treatment of overseas Chinese. This is because British Canada and other places have been making every effort to promote business in China while at the same time restricting overseas Chinese as much as possible. Our government must express its serious concerns in order to change the British attitude. This is not only for the South African Federation but for all British territories. Is this appropriate? We request your review and instruction."</p>

<h3>Pitiful Old Farmer Bitten by a Mad Dog</h3>
<p>Comes to Shanghai Seeking a Cure</p>
<p>Tang Agen, a 29-year-old villager from outside the South Gate of Jiading, has been farming for a living. He has an ox at home to plow the fields. On the afternoon of August 29th (lunar calendar), Tang was leading the ox to graze in the fields. At noon, while the ox was eating grass, a mad dog suddenly ran wildly, bumping east and west. There happened to be another old farmer, about 50 years old, in the field, carrying a hemp bag and sitting on the ground. Unexpectedly, the mad dog ran up and bit the hemp bag, instantly tearing a hole. The flesh on the old man's foot was also torn by the teeth, causing extreme pain and bleeding. Tang intended to lead the ox away, but the mad dog pounced again and bit the ox's foot. The ox, in extreme pain, stumbled and fell into the ditch. Tang, in order to protect the ox, used his whip to strike the dog but was bitten by the dog in his left foot near the small toe, creating a hole the size of two hao coins, with blood dripping. Although he managed to return home, both Tang and the ox walked with difficulty, with intermittent bleeding. They repeatedly sought medical treatment, but it was not effective. Tang later learned that a villager named Wang outside the North Gate had also been bitten by a mad dog and died this month due to lack of treatment. As a result, he was extremely worried. He came to Shanghai from his hometown on the morning of the day before yesterday and is staying with a fellow villager in the French Concession. He intends to seek a cure from all walks of life in order to recover. Tang is in dire straits and lacks the funds to seek a famous doctor. He is extremely anxious and hopes that all sectors, if they have a good remedy for mad dog bites, will immediately inform him at Gong's residence, 22 Yuan Shang Li, Ningbo Road, French Concession, which would also be a charitable act.</p>
<p>Note: Yu Liangxin Pharmacy at the entrance of Shi Jia Lane in the city and Lao Zhenghe Dye House east of Zhengjia Wood Bridge on Avenue Edward VII both have this remedy.</p>

<p>French Water and Electricity Workers Union: Declaration of assistance for the Xin Dingxiang tragedy (summary omitted). The massacre on July 21st, where blood was not yet dry, and the inhuman and unbearable case of French sailors killing our compatriot Xin Dingxiang have occurred one after another. The news has been received with extreme grief and righteous indignation, and deep-seated hatred. How can the brutality and cruelty of French imperialism be tolerated under the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun? If serious negotiations are not pursued, the lives of our compatriots will be worse than chickens and dogs, and national sovereignty will be completely lost. For the sake of national survival, the union will uphold the spirit of fearlessness and strive to resist and support Xin Dingxiang until the goals of victory, the abolition of consular jurisdiction, and the recovery of the concessions are achieved, even if it means sacrificing ourselves. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3>Yuan Shunwu Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Asks About Yuan's Family Situation</p>
<p>Gun Placed Against His Temple</p>
<p>After Police Investigation</p>
<p>Living God of Wealth Rescued from Empty House</p>
<p>Yuan Shunwu, a student at Datong University who was kidnapped and held in a bandit den for five days for a ransom of 400,000 yuan, was rescued at 5:00 AM yesterday at the end of Yangshupu Road. Yuan was kidnapped on Zhongshan Road on Saturday evening. The bandits sent a letter demanding 400,000 yuan for his release. Fortunately, under the direction of District Chief Ren of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and the officers Xu and Wei, along with Detective Liu, the bandits were investigated and arrested. Six kidnappers were captured, and the hostage was safely rescued. However, while Yuan Shunwu was in the bandit den, the bandits guarding him addressed him as the God of Wealth and Old Master. Once the God of Wealth broke through the wall and flew away, the bandits' misfortune was also at its peak.</p>
<p>Hostage Hidden in Empty House: After Yuan Shunwu was kidnapped on the 24th, he was sent by the bandits to an empty house at the intersection of Jungong Road at the end of Yangshupu Road to be hidden. This house originally belonged to a flour mill and has been vacant for a long time, attracting no attention, so the hostage was hidden there. After five days, he was found by the Sixth District Public Security Police at 5:00 AM yesterday. Initially, the Sixth District Public Security Bureau detained a suspect in this case, Zou Yaodong from Hubei, at 1213 Han Bi Li Road in the Public Concession. He was taken back for interrogation and confessed that his fellow villager, Xiao Jianxing, was an accomplice in the case. As a result, Xiao and his wife, Ms. Yu, were also arrested. Then, Fang Dewen, Yi Peihan, and Liu Changming were arrested in succession. Liu confessed the location of the hostage in Yangshupu.</p>
<p>God of Wealth Rescued: At 5:00 AM yesterday, the Sixth District Police, along with an informant, rushed to the hostage location at the intersection of Jungong Road at the end of Yangshupu Road. At that time, it was still dark, and it was raining. A Western-style house could be vaguely seen in the dark. The detectives immediately turned on their electric torches and went straight to the house, breaking down the door. No one was found. They searched the rooms near the door first, but found nothing. Then, they passed through two narrow alleys and saw a row of houses, all with closed doors. In the most remote and dark place, they called out Yuan's name and heard a response. They broke down the door and saw the hostage Yuan Shunwu lying on the bed. The bandit guard had escaped without a trace, leaving only three pistols. At this time, Yuan was wearing a shirt on his upper body and suit pants on his lower body. He was in good spirits. Yuan said that there were four bandits guarding him, day and night, calling him the God of Wealth and Old Master, and treating him well with food, drinks, and tea. They even bought books for him to read when he wanted to. What was unbearable was that when the bandit leader asked about his family situation, the bandit held two guns, pointing the muzzles directly at his temples, making him feel uneasy and disturbed.</p>
<p>Case Investigation: After Yuan Shunwu was kidnapped, the bandits sent letters to Datong University three times, demanding 400,000 yuan. During the last letter reception, the Sixth District Public Security Bureau had already arrested Zou Yaodong and Xiao Jianxing, and the investigation was progressing smoothly. On the 28th, it was learned that the accomplices Fang Dewen and others were hiding in Room 38 of the Tongyi Hotel on Liu Ma Road in the Public Concession. District Chief Ren of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau ordered Officers Xu Tao and Wei Jiechen, along with Detective Team Leader Liu Shaoqing, to go there at 4:00 PM and wait in another room. At 11:30 PM, the kidnapper Fang Dewen returned to the Tongyi Hotel and was lured into the room where the detectives were staying to talk. Fang realized that the situation was not good and offered 150 yuan to bribe the detectives. The detectives pretended to cooperate and unexpectedly arrested Fang. Under interrogation, he confessed the location of the hostage, but only his accomplice Liu Changming knew the location. So they rushed to Ninganfang on North Zhejiang Road and arrested Liu.</p>
<p>No Time to Put on Pants: Liu Changming was hiding in the fourth house in Ninganfang on North Zhejiang Road. The detectives of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau first notified a police station in the Fourth District before proceeding to arrest him. It was around 2:30 AM yesterday. The bandit Liu heard someone coming and jumped out of bed, not even having time to put on his pants. He ran naked to the [missing text] house and hid under the bed behind the living room. After Liu was arrested, he confessed the location of the hostage. The Sixth District Police then joined the police of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei and rushed to Yangshupu overnight to rescue the hostage.</p>
<h3>Declaration by Various Municipal Party Committees on the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal First Enlarged Propaganda Conference issued a declaration regarding the case of Ms. Xiao Xin'an being humiliated, stating (summary omitted): The cruelty of the imperialists from Japan, the United States, France, Italy, and other countries towards oppressed peoples is no less than that of Britain. In recent years, the Chinese nation has suffered greatly from the oppression, exploitation, humiliation, trampling, and killing by imperialists. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our party, could not bear to see our 400 million Chinese compatriots perish, so he raised his arms and carried out the revolution, hoping to break free from the shackles of the imperialists and build a democratic, people-owned, and people-enjoyed Republic of China that would stand permanently in the world. Unfortunately, in the 1911 Revolution, the comrades of our party did not abide by the revolutionary oaths and did not follow the leader's proposals, so the revolutionary strategies were not implemented, and the revolutionary ideology could not be realized, creating a situation of fragmentation and popular suffering for more than ten years, giving all the imperialists the opportunity to gain an inch. At present, the comrades of our party have awakened from the pain. Since the Northern Expedition in 1926, all the reactionary forces in the country have been gradually eliminated, and we could have shifted our focus to actively attack the imperialists. However, for the past three years, newly emerging warlords have rebelled, allowing the rampant imperialists to survive. Thinking of this, how can we not be saddened? Recently, Ms. Xiao Xin'an went to Southeast Asia to educate our overseas Chinese children. Unfortunately, she was raped by the chief mate and second mate of the Zha Hua Shipping Company's ship, the "Zhi Bate." This is a rare and great humiliation in history and in the world. This is not just the animalistic behavior of the chief mate and second mate of the "Zhi Bate," but it fully reveals the entire sinister face of the imperialists. This is not just the humiliation of Ms. Xiao Xin'an, but it is a rare and great humiliation for the entire Chinese nation and all oppressed peoples in the world. This is tolerable, but what is intolerable? We hope that all compatriots in the country will unite and fight a life-and-death battle with the imperialists. If imperialism is not overthrown, China's sovereignty will not be complete, China's independence and freedom will not be achieved, and the life and happiness of the Chinese nation will not be guaranteed. For now, we can only urge the government to submit serious negotiations to the Zha Hua Shipping Company, (1) severely punish the chief mate and second mate of the "Zhi Bate," (2) compensate Ms. Xiao for her reputation damage, (3) formally apologize to our country, and (4) guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. On the other hand, we should swear not to ride the Zha Hua Shipping Company's ships again in the future, and automatically raise capital to establish shipping companies to recover the rights and protect the safety of overseas Chinese. This is our declaration. Shanghai Special Municipal First Enlarged Propaganda Conference.</p>

<h3>Extortion by Threat and Forcing the Writing of "Fu Xi"</h3>
<p>To Show Sincere Negotiation</p>
<p>Three Bandits Arrested After Police Report</p>
<p>At the Rong Sheng Xiang cigarette and paper shop, located at No. 287 Tokyo Road, Shanghai West, and owned by Mrs. Feng Zhang from Ningbo, on the 28th of last month, a threatening letter was received from a gang via the post office, demanding 2,000 yuan. It stated that if there was a sincere intention to negotiate, a red paper slip with the characters "Fu Xi" should be posted on the glass window outside the shop counter as a sign. Mrs. Feng reported the letter to the Putuo Road police station in charge and requested an investigation. Subsequently, Mrs. Feng Zhang received three more letters in succession, but each letter was sent by someone dispatched by the gang. On the 27th of this month, at 7 p.m., Mrs. Feng received another letter, instructing her to place the money in a British-brand cigarette box between 12 noon and 1 p.m. the following day and deliver it to the spot behind the British candle factory on Binlang Road, where there was a white paper pasted on the wall, and someone would come to collect it. Mrs. Feng reported this to the police station again. At around 12 noon the day before yesterday, detective Ji Liren, detectives Ma Zonglai, Qi Mengqing, patrolmen Li Shugui, Cui Yulou, and Shao Fuhai, disguised themselves and waited in the nearby sheds. Mrs. Feng sent her shop assistant, Zhang Qiqing, to deliver the British-brand cigarette box on time. Before long, four people were seen lingering in the area for a long time and then approached Zhang to speak with him. The detectives rushed out and arrested them. Unexpectedly, the four bandits scattered and fled. Two of them, Wang Liancheng and Zhou Xiaoerzi (19 years old), both from Jiangbei, were captured on the spot, along with the cigarette box, and taken to the police station. The other two escaped. Later, Zhou Xiaoerzi confessed that the two who escaped were a Mr. Gu and Xu Gengcheng. Gu lived at No. 175 Binlang Road, and Xu lived at No. 131 on the same road. Chinese and Western detectives went to the addresses to make arrests, but only Xu Gengcheng, also from Jiangbei and only 15 years old, was apprehended. Gu's whereabouts were unknown. The police chief ordered him to be detained as well. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the case and said that the police were still investigating the threatening letters, so he requested an extension. Patrolman Li Shugui also reported the details of the breakthrough. Mrs. Feng Zhang, the plaintiff, also stated that four years ago, she opened the Yichang Xiang cigarette and sundry shop on Moganshan Road and was robbed, with gunfire used as a warning. Later, her shop was destroyed by fire, and she received several hundred taels in fire insurance compensation from the insurance company. Soon after, she received five threatening letters, the first of which mentioned the robbery and compensation. She requested an investigation. When questioned, Wang Liancheng confessed that the matter was done by the fugitive Mr. Gu, and he had delivered letters for him. Yesterday, Gu had also asked him to collect the cigarette box. Zhou and Xu also confessed that they had gone together yesterday but knew nothing else. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confessions and ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody pending further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers from Xinchang Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Jin Jiulin, a detective inspector from the Special Agency of the French Police, detectives Li Yaolong, Qian Yumin, patrolmen Zhou Buguang, Zhang Ziying, and others, recently learned that there were kidnappers at No. 16 Yu Kang Lane, Pishao Nai Road. They went to arrest five men and women: bandits Zhou Shuntang, Zhu Gaosheng, Chen Ziyao, female bandit Zhou Qiusi, and Zhu Husi. They were taken to the police station. When questioned by the police chief, the bandits confessed that they had kidnapped Zhang Kunhua, the owner of a southern goods store, outside the east gate of Yancun Village in their hometown of Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, earlier this year and released him after receiving a ransom. They had only been in Shanghai for a short time and had not committed any crimes. The police chief, upon receiving this confession, ordered them to be detained. Yesterday, they were escorted to the French Court for interrogation. First, the Western Detective Chief, Sa Cai'er, reported the previous situation. After a brief interrogation by the Chinese and Western officials, they were ordered to be remanded in custody pending a reply from Xinchang County.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Wife, Selling of Daughter, and Disrespect to Elderly Mother</h3>
<p>Cao Wanfu Sued by His Wife</p>
<p>Requesting Court to Order Divorce</p>
<p>Mrs. Cao Liu, from Yangzhou, was betrothed to Cao Wanfu, a fellow villager, by her parents at a young age, and she immediately became a child bride. Because her husband did not engage in proper work and was devoted to gambling and dissipation, his mother, who was over sixty years old, had to work as a servant to provide for his squandering. This year, he sold his own daughter into a brothel. Mrs. Liu was repeatedly abused and could not bear the suffering. She retained lawyer Song Shixiang to file a lawsuit with the District Court for a divorce to save her life. The gist of her complaint was that the defendant was disrespectful to his parents, sold his daughter, and abused his wife. His conscience was extinguished, and it was difficult to live with him until old age. The plaintiff was betrothed to the defendant by her parents at the age of seven and immediately became a child bride. She married him in the village the following year. Later, the defendant went out to work as a cook but did not engage in proper work and was devoted to gambling and dissipation, abandoning his mother and wife and ignoring his family. The following year, she gave birth to a son, and the family burden became heavier. She relied entirely on her own labor to support the family. Before long, she gave birth to another son. Unable to make a living in the village, she came to Shanghai with her sixty-one-year-old mother to seek work. Her elderly aunt now works as a servant at the Xin Kang Lane, Da Tong Road, Xinzha, and her hard-earned money is squandered by the defendant. The plaintiff initially worked in a Shanghai cotton mill, but because she could not bear the defendant's harassment for money, the factory dismissed her. She then became a servant, but within a few months, she was harassed by the defendant, and the employers, fearing his violence and potential accidents, dismissed her. She changed jobs several times but never had a stable life. Before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, the defendant, due to debt, cruelly sold his six-year-old daughter, Xiaomei, into a brothel and used the money for gambling. When the plaintiff found out and tried to reason with him, she was brutally beaten, covered in injuries, and slandered. She was bedridden for several days. Under these circumstances, the affection was obviously broken. She requested a divorce in accordance with the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Shouyi opened the court for trial. The plaintiff, Cao Liu, recounted the previous situation and requested that the court examine the scars on her arms from the beatings. When questioned, Cao Wanfu claimed that all the plaintiff's allegations were false, and he had not committed any acts of violence and did not want a divorce. Prosecutor Wang attended the court and expressed his opinions. The debate then began. The judge considered the arguments concluded and set the judgment date for the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>The Scandal of the Female Bus Conductor</h3>
<p>Xia Xiuying and Wu Dan</p>
<p>Li Qiaosheng Catches Them in Adultery</p>
<p>Xia Xiuying, a female conductor on the Shanghai South Public Bus, recently fell in love with a passenger, Wu Dan, and eloped with him, lodging in the Datong Hotel. Unexpectedly, Xiuying's husband, Li Qiaosheng, found them and brought them to the First Sub-Bureau of the First District to file charges. The details are recorded below: Xia Xiuying is from Ningbo, is just over twenty years old, and is quite beautiful. Her father, Dinghua, rents a house at No. 65 Nanmatou Street. In April of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Xia Xiuying, through the introduction of matchmaker Xie Xuekang, was betrothed to Li Qiaosheng, from Nanjing. In January of the following year, they married and lived together at No. 327 Nanzhan Road. Li Qiaosheng, now twenty-five years old, works as a conductor No. 298 at the French Tram Company. His monthly income is meager, and the household expenses are often tight. Since Xiuying married into the family, the relationship between the two has been fairly good, and they have each had a child. The son has already died young, and the daughter, named Peidi, is four years old. As the family grew, the expenses increased, and the expenditures became alarming. This year, when the Public Bus Company recruited female conductors, Xiuying was introduced and became conductor No. 76 in the company, earning a monthly salary to supplement the family income. There was a Cantonese man named Wu Dan, now twenty-three years old, who graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and now earns more than two hundred yuan a month. Wu recently came to Shanghai on business and always took the Shanghai South Public Bus. Therefore, he met Xiuying. Wu, seeing that Xiuying was attractive, made advances, and Xiuying, seeing that Wu was young and handsome, immediately favored him. Thus, the two fell in love. Recently, the heat between the two had reached the boiling point. However, the thought of her husband was an obstacle, and they could not do as they pleased. So, on September 7th of this year, she eloped behind her husband's back. After his wife disappeared, Li immediately hired people to search everywhere but could not find her. Until recently, someone secretly told him that Xiuying had privately met a man named Wu Dan and was now lodging with him in the Southeast Hotel next to the Great World. Li, upon hearing this news, was furious and immediately went to the hotel to inquire. The tea servant claimed that they had moved to Room No. 8 of the Datong Hotel at Wangjia Wharf in the South City. After hearing this, Li rushed to the destination at around 6 p.m. yesterday and called Gao Xigui, the guard on duty at Post 15, to enter with him. When he reached Room No. 8, he pushed the door open and saw Xiuying and Wu Dan lying on the same bed. He brought the man and woman back to the First Sub-Bureau of the First District. After a preliminary interrogation by the bureau chief, the case was deemed important, and he immediately ordered a written report to be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>At around 9:45 a.m. the day before yesterday, the No. 5 passenger bus of the Baoshan Chengsongyang Long-Distance Bus Company set off from Baoshan Station. When it was traveling on Nantongji Road, Sanguantang, Wusong, five or six men wearing Zhongshan suits flagged down the bus to pick them up to go to Songjiang. The bus driver, Zhou Ada, thought that the place was not a station, and he was afraid that stopping would delay the connection with the Songjiang-Shanghai train, so he ignored them and drove away quickly. When the bus arrived at Wusong Station to exchange passengers, and then set off from Songjiang Station, it drove back to Nantongji Road, Sanguantang, at around 10 a.m. Unexpectedly, the men were blocking the road, preventing the bus from moving forward. The driver had no choice but to stop the engine. The men immediately went forward to negotiate with the driver, Zhou Ada, saying why he did not stop the bus when they flagged it down but drove away quickly. Zhou then replied that this was not a station, and according to the company's regulations, he could not stop, and that the bus was full just now, so there was no way to accommodate them. He asked them to forgive him. Unexpectedly, the men became enraged and dragged Zhou out of the bus, punching and kicking him. At that time, Zhang Jiaxi, the police officer escorting the bus, saw the driver being beaten and went forward to persuade them, but he was also twisted and beaten severely. As a result, Zhou and Zhang's heads, faces, hands, feet, and other parts were seriously injured, and they fell to the road. The men then proceeded to smash the bus's engine parts and glass windows. There were more than ten male and female passengers in the bus, who were terrified at the sight and feared being affected, so they jumped out of the bus through the windows. After succeeding, the men leisurely fled south. After the incident, the long-distance bus company immediately sent a bus to the scene after receiving reports from passengers. The injured driver, Zhou Ada, and police officer Zhang Jiaxi, were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the damaged bus was towed back to the company for repair. At the same time, a report was filed with the County Public Security Bureau. After hearing the news, all the drivers of the bus company went on strike in protest of Zhou Ada being beaten and injured for no reason, demanding that the company request the authorities to investigate and deal with the murderers and provide guarantees for the future. If there was no satisfactory solution, they would not resume work. Although the company staff tried to persuade them, the drivers' attitude was very firm. As a result, from 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, all the scheduled passenger buses on the Songyang, Chengsong, and Chengyang lines were announced to be suspended for the whole day. Afterwards, Shen Jing, the Director of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, and Qian Tianpeng, the Director of the Construction Bureau, jointly went to the bus company to persuade the drivers, guaranteeing that the same incident would not happen again and promising to investigate and deal with the perpetrators. It was not until the night before last that all the drivers were satisfied and agreed to resume work the next day. Therefore, starting yesterday, the long-distance buses on the Chengsongyang lines have been operating as usual.</p>
<h3>Housewife Shot During Robbery on Miller Road</h3>
<p>At 6:25 p.m. last night, four thugs arrived at No. 723 Miller Road, Hongkou. Three of them were carrying pistols and threatened the homeowner. When the housewife shouted for help, one of the robbers fired a shot, wounding the housewife. She bled profusely. The robbers, fearing the arrival of the police, fled in a hurry without stealing anything. The homeowner reported the incident to the police station in charge and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday was: Cloudy skies with thunderstorms or heavy fog in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The wind is strengthening in this area due to the low pressure originating in Jiangxi, which is moving in a northeasterly direction. There is a strong north wind in Shandong. Along the coast from Fujian southward, the wind is nondirectional. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 68.7, and the lowest was 55.0. On the same day last year, the highest was 73.2, and the lowest was 49.1.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief:</p>
<p>Having read the news item "Armed Water Police Flee" in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 26th of this month, there are some discrepancies with the facts. Here is a brief account of the case: Wang Zixun, a second-class patrol officer of the No. 2 patrol of the No. 4 squadron of the 17th team of the original garrisoned Hengsha Water Police, left his post without permission. Three water patrols, Yang Wenpu, Zhang Shujing, and Cao Fang'an, colluded with bandits and fled on the night of September 23, carrying firearms. After hearing the news, our district immediately issued orders to investigate and arrest them. Subsequently, Gong Mianqin, the captain of the 17th team, reported to us, and we have already submitted a report to the Provincial Department for their arrest. As for patrol officer Wang Zixun, he left his post beforehand and has avoided meeting since the incident. We have ordered a strict arrest, but there is still no news of his whereabouts. This is the true course of events. I am writing to request a correction to clarify the truth and hope that you will publish it in your newspaper's "Letters" column. I wish you peace.</p>
<p>From the Fourth District Department of the Jiangsu Water Police Corps, October 28th.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Wife (sitting up in bed in the middle of the night): Dear! Do you hear that? There are thieves downstairs.</p>
<p>Husband: No, no. Go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Wife: Listen. I know there must be thieves downstairs.</p>
<p>Husband: I know there are definitely no thieves downstairs.</p>
<p>Wife: You're mistaken. There must be thieves downstairs.</p>
<p>Thief (from the back room, speaking): Madam, your husband is right. We are all upstairs.</p>
<p>A (watching the excitement at the entrance of a birthday celebrant's home): How old is that birthday mother, anyway? She looks very strong.</p>
<p>B: Didn't you see the golden characters on that birthday banner? It clearly says "Ninetieth Grand Celebration." That madam is already ninety years old.</p>
<p>A: What about that skinny old man standing next to her? Who is he?</p>
<p>B: That's her husband. He's eighty-eight years old this year.</p>
<p>A: But why is he looking so miserable and unhappy?</p>
<p>B: Because he's been paying the life insurance premiums for his wife for forty years and still has to keep paying. He's extremely resentful.</p>
<p>Female A: When you get married in the future, what kind of person do you plan to marry?</p>
<p>Female B: I want to marry a doctor. When I get sick, someone will be there to treat me, and I won't have to pay.</p>
<p>Female A: I think you'll die eventually. You might as well marry a coffin shop owner. When you die, you'll have a good coffin, and you won't have to pay.</p>
<h3>Snippets from Overseas</h3>
<p>— Lao Feng</p>
<p>Seven years have passed since I left the bustling city of Paris. When I think of my travels in the past, it's as if I'm tracing the inscriptions on ancient, mottled steles. It's so vague. Zhang Jiangling once said, "My mind travels through the nine border fortresses, two or three times a day." Every time I think of these words, I can't help but linger. My former classmates have returned home one after another, their carriages filling the capital, to serve the Party and the country. Only my friend, Mr. Chen, continues to move forward. Isn't he an extraordinary person? The moon is setting on the roof beams, and I miss his face. The friendship of an old friend is profound, and a letter has come all the way from overseas. I excerpt a few points to aid our conversation. I dare not use exciting or stimulating words to bother my readers.</p>
<p>Ten Diplomats Can't Catch Up with International Glory is Originally Meant for Diplomats to Catch Up. But if a country produces a world-famous filmmaker or athlete, it may win considerable prestige for the country. Or the gains may be several times greater than those of diplomats. If you don't believe me, look at the example of the Japan-U.S. competition. In a certain Japan-U.S. tennis match overseas, the competition was for the world's number one record. Naturally, it caused a sensation among the French public, who have always valued sports. During the match, the judge made a mistake and gave Japan one more point. The Japanese athlete immediately deliberately lost one point to show that he was very unwilling to accept a point obtained by luck. The crowd in the stands naturally unanimously praised the Japanese athlete's noble morality as unattainable. The next morning, the newspapers printed headlines to praise him. The conclusion also said that the glory won by an athlete in the international arena is something that ten diplomats cannot catch up with.</p>
<p>A French Old Lady Makes a Solemn Vow One day, a French lady came to my (Mr. Chen refers to himself) residence and asked for the address of a Chinese classmate. Her expression was very different from her usual friendly and approachable demeanor. I was very surprised. Taking the opportunity, I asked her what was going on. She angrily explained the details to me. I learned that this classmate had been living in her house for a long time. But he neither studied nor worked. He was busy socializing with friends of different races and genders, dancing, and enjoying big meals. He was having a great time. Sometimes, when the government funding didn't arrive and he was short of money, he would ask her to lend him a little money. As a result, he accumulated thousands of francs. Later, he left on some pretext. Even during the New Year and holidays, he still sent her a greeting card. But the addresses he wrote were all fake. She didn't understand his deceit and went to find him according to the address, but she was just chasing shadows. I was so ashamed when I heard this story. By chance, a few days later, another classmate wanted to find a house and went to her house. She resolutely said "Je n'ai rien à faire avec les Chinois" (meaning "I never want to associate with the Chinese"). This classmate was turned away, still baffled. This kind of thing doesn't amount to much in the country. But abroad, it's not an individual issue but a collective issue. So, when I'm overseas, I'm like walking on thin ice, always vigilant. Although it's difficult to hope that I can increase the glory of the nation alone, I dare not belittle myself and cause shame to the entire nation.</p>
<h3>Paper Quilt</h3>
<p>— Mo Chi</p>
<p>In a previous issue of Free Talk, it was mentioned that a certain gentleman had no quilt in winter and instead pasted thick newspaper together to make a covering. He would curl up inside it at night as a regular habit. People found it strange and pitied his circumstances. Little did they know that this was exactly what the ancients called a "paper quilt." When I read Zhang Xiaoxiang's Yuhu Collection, there are two poems sending paper quilts to Han Zhongfu. One of them says, "Han Lang's incense is exhausted, and all connections are severed. The tattered cassock is burned by the lamp for Buddhist incense. I beg to give him a paper quilt as warm as cotton, to stir up dreams in his drunkenness." The other says, "I know that all dreams are illusions, and illusions often arise from dreams. The prodigal's Daoist heart is due to this dream. When the dream is over, return the paper quilt to me." So, I wonder what kind of paper the so-called paper quilt is made of and how it can be so gentle. Moreover, it stirs up dreams and corrupts people's Daoist hearts. Gentlemen of erudition and elegance, can you teach me?</p>
<h3>Inspiration and Associations from the Divine</h3>
<p>— Wang Gongyu</p>
<p>Character Prediction is also called Character Decomposition. It is also called Character Breaking or Character Phrenology. It is a type of divination. A character is chosen at random, and its radicals and strokes are separated, combined, and cross-referenced, or it is associated by inspiration, to judge the good or bad luck of human affairs. The Zhìmíng Xīnfǎ (Direct Pointing to the Mind Method) says: When Tang Pei Jin Gong (Li Jing) was conquering Wu Yuanji, he dug up a stone with the inscription "The chicken is not fat, the wine is not ripe." The character predictor interpreted it as: "The chicken is not fat, there is no meat, so it is 己 (jǐ, the sixth Heavenly Stem)." "The wine is not ripe, there is no water, so it is 酉 (yǒu, the tenth Heavenly Stem)." "The defeat of the bandit will be on the jǐ-yǒu day." Indeed, it was. This is the beginning of character phrenology. Also, the History of the Sui Book: Classics and Books contains one volume of Essentials of Breaking Characters. The Yan Family Instructions say that this is the modern-day Character Decomposition. This is the origin of Character Breaking and Character Decomposition. By the Song Dynasty, there was Xie Shi, who was famous for Character Decomposition. Its origins have been long. However, the Character Prediction has not been deeply studied. As for those who set up stalls on the side of the road to earn a living, I have not seen them able to grasp the divine inspiration and associations. They are just talking nonsense. Recently, I was at a certain inn and listened to friends talking about strange events, which made me forget my fatigue. All the things they talked about were worthy of recording. So, I will first describe the section on Character Prediction. It said: There was a certain gentleman who set up a school in a certain county, which was quite famous. It shook the whole city. The magistrate of the county alone did not believe it and even harbored ill will towards him, wanting to expel him. However, in view of his usual interactions with the gentry of the county, who all praised him highly, he feared causing a backlash. So, he went to the gentleman's school in disguise to test his skills. He casually picked up a "人" (rén, person) character from the plate and said, "Please predict what kind of person I am." The gentleman did not hesitate and said, "You picked up the '人' character with one hand. Combining them, it becomes '大' (dà, big). You are an official." The magistrate was silent, left the fee as usual, and left. He then ordered his servant to go to the school in formal attire. The servant wrote the "人" character on his palm and asked the gentleman to predict what kind of person he was. The gentleman said, "Please don't be offended. You are a person under the hand of another person. You are a servant." The servant returned and told the magistrate. The magistrate was shocked by his accuracy. However, he still thought it was a coincidence. He then brought a prisoner from the prison, tidied him up, rode in a carriage to the school, and instructed him to verbally describe the "人" character. He asked the gentleman to predict what kind of person he was. The prisoner did as he was told and deliberately acted arrogantly, as if he were a wealthy old man. The gentleman still did not hesitate and said, "You are a prisoner. The '人' character in the mouth is a prison." The prisoner was discouraged. The magistrate, upon hearing this, believed him without a doubt. This is similar to the story of Qiao Gong Heqiao in our county. Qiao Gong knew our county and did not believe in ghosts and gods. Hearing that a certain spirit altar was very effective, he wanted to denounce it. Fearing that the local people would not agree, he dismissed everyone at night and personally drafted ten questions, all of which were impossible for people to answer. The next morning, he burned them in front of the altar and asked the spirit medium to answer them. Unexpectedly, the planchette moved on the sand, and in a moment, it answered all the questions one by one. At the end, it also attached a poem, revealing Qiao Gong's secrets. Qiao Gong was greatly shocked and convinced. He was terrified and at a loss. From then on, he worshipped the spirit altar more devoutly than others. To this day, the published version of Qiao Gong's Ten Questions and Answers is still circulating. The incident of the county magistrate's character prediction and the Qiao Gong's altar incident can truly be said to be "almost the same."</p>
<h3>Special Prayers</h3>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>There are many superstitious behaviors in our society. Special prayers are one of them. It is quite interesting to talk about. Please, readers of this newspaper, take a look at the following items.</p>
<p>(1) Using Destruction as Prayer: This refers to the act of destruction as a procedure for prayer. When villagers pay homage to the Buddhas in the Three Temples of Hangzhou, they often pass by the tomb of Su Xiaoxiao. They would pick up bricks and stones and throw them at the tomb pavilion, saying that this act is a way to pray for abundant silkworm harvests (meaning to profit from raising silkworms).</p>
<p>(2) Using Gambling as Prayer: This is probably the same group of people. When they pay homage at the tomb of Yue Fei, they often stroke the iron-cast breasts of Lady Qin Wang and say, "This year, our silkworm harvest will be 240%." (240% is a common expression for praying for silkworm harvests).</p>
<p>(3) Using Defilement as Prayer: Also this group of people. In addition to stroking the breasts of Lady Qin Wang, they would also pull down their pants and pour their "soul-returning soup" (urine) on the iron statues of Qin Hui and others, saying that it would also make the silkworm harvest good.</p>
<p>(4) Using Begging as Prayer: When a child suffers from malaria, their parents will try to please the Kitchen God. However, the method is somewhat different from the usual fasting for the Kitchen God. The tea used at the time was made by begging for tea leaves from seven households. Some also begged for rice or food from seven families. Others collected money from seven families to buy supplies for fasting for the Kitchen God.</p>
<p>(5) Using Theft as Prayer: A custom in the countryside of Wuxing County, Zhejiang: "After people are quiet in Mid-Autumn Festival, they compete to steal melons and rice. Those who get them are considered to have a sign of having a son." (See the Huzhou Prefecture Chronicle). Even thievery is transformed into prayer.</p>
<p>(6) Using Recitation as Prayer: On the walls of the urinal, there are often such red paper strips: "Heavenly Emperor, Earthly Emperor, my family has a crying baby at night. A kind person reads it once, and he will sleep soundly until dawn." This is another example of using recitation as prayer.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Southeast Asia (67)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On August 3rd, I went to Maymyo with Li Zhenzhong, Zhuang Haiquan, and Yang Zhen. Maymyo is located northeast of Mandalay, about 48 miles away. The four of us took a car for eight yuan. The road was high and lined with tall trees and small forests that blocked the sky. We often saw herds of cattle, but they did not have beautiful horns like those in Penang. Every mile had a stone marker indicating the mileage. Maymyo is the name of a very large hillside. After traveling more than 20 miles, we gradually went uphill, with extremely winding roads, similar to the car roads in Nanning, Guangxi. However, at the cliffs, there were stone walls, wooden posts, or iron wires to block them, to avoid driving dangers. This is the best method. Looking down at Mandalay, it was like looking from the sky. The clouds were six or seven hundred feet high. Just halfway there, the highest point of the mountain was 24 miles. There was a small parking spot with a flowing spring and stones. We washed our feet in it and immediately felt refreshed. This is an extremely cool place in Southeast Asia. The British Governor and the Chinese Consul often come here to escape the heat. Continuing forward, we went downhill. Along the way, there were various flowers of red, yellow, white, and purple, as well as fruit trees. I heard that Japanese people grow grapes here and can earn thousands of dollars each year. Gradually, we saw thatched huts, bamboo fences, grains, and vegetables. Burmese people farm here and live a very simple life. I heard that the spring water here is excellent, not only cool but also of high quality. We often saw clear streams flowing. Soon, we saw red houses hidden among the trees. We arrived at Maymyo City. This small market town is fresher than Yangon. However, there are only about one hundred Chinese people. There is a Chinese Association. When we knocked on the door, only an old man was guarding it. We couldn't communicate with him. There was a sign for the Da Ying School, but there were no students. They said it had disbanded. We stayed at the Liang Jinshan Villa. His brother-in-law, Mr. Yin, was guarding the house. Yin's father was Cantonese, and his mother was Burmese. He spoke English fluently. We asked about the Burmese King. He said that the Burmese King was captured in 1885 and died in India. We asked why the palace was so desolate. Many Japanese people came to build houses, but they have all collapsed now. We asked who the royal family members were. He said there were only three daughters. One married an Indian, and two married Burmese. How could they plan anything else? I asked the names of the royal daughters. He replied that he didn't know. We asked about the local products of northern Burma. He replied that Burma is a very rich place. Rubies come from Na Ga, yellow jade from Hukang, and green jade from Ma Geng, but I don't know the methods of mining them. Many Chinese people have become wealthy. This small market town has no English, Burmese, or Chinese newspapers. It is a rural market. There are Yunnanese inns and restaurants. Staying and eating two meals costs only one dollar per day. The dishes include meat and chicken, which can be considered cheap. Eating without staying costs the same price, half a dollar per meal, because there is no charge for lodging. The food is very delicious. Yunnan and Sichuan have the same taste, both are famous Chinese cuisines. During the day, we talked with Mr. Yin in a small building. Before we knew it, the window was open and the wind was cold. I couldn't stand it, so I asked to close the window. I even put on a long jacket. This was something I hadn't done in Southeast Asia for half a year. I suddenly felt cold. Singapore is below zero degrees. Going north past Mandalay, we had reached 23 degrees north latitude, in the temperate zone, on the same line as Shantou, Guangzhou, and Liuzhou, facing each other east and west, near the Yunnan border. Winter here may require cotton clothing. You don't need to shower with cold water usually. I had suffered from the heat for half a year. Now I had entered a cool place in Southeast Asia. I was indescribably happy.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (304)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Tears Fall on All Sides, Melancholy Red Affection; An Audience Overwhelmed, Lingering Green Intent</p>
<p>Looking at the fight, it was almost over. Everything visible in the room was in ruins. Even the quilts and pillows on the bed had been splashed with several basins of water. Little Sister, terrified, hid in the small room, trembling uncontrollably. Madam Yin then called a halt to the battle. As she left, she pointed at Lianxiang and said, "I'll spare you for today. When the master returns, he will settle the score with you." After saying this, she led the group of women she had brought and the chief of staff and vanguard, and left. After Madam Yin left, Lianxiang looked at the broken and ruined state of the room, and felt truly heartbroken. It was as if a major army had passed through, leaving the entire city in ruins. All the dressing tables in the room were broken, with shattered porcelain scattered all over the floor. They were all bought at great expense. Fortunately, the clothes in the chests and the jewelry in the cabinets were untouched. Lianxiang had already cried her eyes out. Little Sister, like a local official responsible for defending the area, returned to her old place after the enemy troops left. She tried her best to comfort Lianxiang. She said, "Crying is useless. We have to take care of the aftermath. We have to clean up the place. Don't throw away all the broken porcelain pieces. Leave them there for the master to see when he returns. They are proof for us for the rest of our lives. We are afraid he won't pay for the damaged items. If the old things are broken, we can replace them with new ones. But the bed is in such a mess. What are we going to do? How can we sleep tonight when it's so wet? Hurry up and open the chest and take out a clean set of bedding. I'll take the wet bedding to wash." At this point, Lianxiang had no choice but to endure and wait for the master to return and see what he would say. When the master returned, there was a big scene at home. The concubine also had no choice but to cry to the master about the grievances she had suffered that day. At this point, the Yin master almost flattened his head. Madam Yin's intention was, of course, to forbid the master from going to that side again. That kind of dirty goods should be kicked out. But if she was kicked out, how could the Yin master bear it? He had no choice but to move to another place. At home, he only said that the small villa had been canceled. In fact, he built a secret love nest elsewhere. Last time, the coachman Gengsheng was the one to blame. Gengsheng also knew that his job was gone, so he had no choice but to quit and find another place to work. The Yin master, fearing that the secret would be leaked, didn't take a carriage. Every day, he hired a rickshaw and sneaked to the secret love nest alone, thinking that he was foolproof. Who knew that he had this chief of staff who was also the captain of the detective team, the young master, who was ordered by his commander, Madam Yin, to keep an eye on his father. He was caught again. As Cuiyun was telling the story, someone came downstairs to hire her to sing. Zuo Shichen said, "Keep it simple. Finish it quickly."</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Ultimately Show Decline</h3>
<p>Highly Variable, First Rising and Then Falling: Yesterday, the 29th, the gold market was still chaotic, rising and then falling. The psychology of the industry was different. Throughout the day, there were a total of seven taels of change, with twists and turns of two or three taels from time to time, making it difficult to speculate. In the end, it tended to decline. The foreign exchange market was still stable, and the silver price was slightly sold off. In the morning session, demand exceeded supply in various exchanges, such as Yuanmao, Yongda, Dachen, Yuansheng, and Wupin, all of which bought in. Shunli, Wanxing, and Hengxing were all sellers. However, from morning to noon, there was quite a rotation, and it once reached a peak, exceeding the 90-tael mark. This was because Wupin and other companies aggressively covered their short positions. Later, Yuansheng, Chenfeng, Yong and others competed to buy, and the price remained firm. After that, it hovered around 89 taels. However, when news of a recovery in Indian exchange rates suddenly emerged, the people's hearts were agitated, and Yuanmao, Yongda, Dachen, Taixing, and coverers eagerly sold out. The market atmosphere suddenly weakened, and in an instant, the wind and waves were raging, the sharpness was greatly reduced, and the price plummeted by more than five or six taels, suddenly reaching 83 taels. In short, this was the reverse after a sudden rise. Is it difficult for both buyers and sellers to start? In the early morning, large bars of silver were lengthened by 1/16, but the silver price did not move. However, the pre-market forecast yesterday was for a decline, but yesterday's telegram said no. The incident was contrary. Fortunately, there was news of the United States selling silver bars, so the gold price did not go down.</p>
<p>Covering Short Positions Jumps to 90 Taels: The initial opening price of the December gold standard was 586 taels and 7 qian, up 9 qian (but the gross board only counted 85 taels, followed by 6 taels and change). Later, there seemed to be more sellers, and it retreated to around 85 taels. Then, Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yong and others came in to buy, and it pulled up another three taels or so, totaling 8 taels, 1 or 2 qian. As for foreign exchange, it was flat. Shanghai sold 1,725 British pounds in gold for November, and Hengxing and others also sold, which suppressed it by another 2 taels. When the first order was announced not to be changed, it was 6 taels, 3 or 4 qian. Then, it hovered around 6 taels. Mitsui sold 1 tael, 2 qian, 7 fen, 875 Japanese yen in gold for November, and Yuda, Fuxing, Yong and others also sold off. Suddenly, it fell by 2 taels, totaling 84 taels and 5 qian. After 10 o'clock, it gradually went upward, because Fuchang, Yuda, Tianyu, Yongxie, Yujin'an and others bought in one after another, especially the industry's buying. The British gold was calculated at 1,725 for December and 1,875 for November, which was not easy to obtain. The price of gold jumped by 5 taels at 1,875 for December only. After 11 o'clock, it was 89 taels, 3 or 4 qian. After the entry, the coverers sold out, and then it was suppressed by a small 2 taels, to 7 taels, 4 or 5 qian. At 11:30, Yuancheng, Zhifeng, Yong and Wupin and other companies started competing to buy, and the market was extremely sharp, jumping 3 taels. At 11:45, it reached 90 taels and 2 qian. Soon after, Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifeng, Yong and others took this opportunity to sell out, and it had depreciated by more than 1 tael, only a few qian high or low. When the market closed at noon, it was 89 taels and 2 qian, and then it was reduced by a small 4 or 5 qian. The quoted price was still calculated at 624 taels and 6 qian, and it was clamped down by a small 40 taels to 35 taels.</p>
<p>Indian Exchange Rate Rises, Market Situation Softens: The post-market opened at 88 taels and 8 qian (gross board 9 taels, 1 or 2 qian), and later reduced to 87 taels, 7 or 8 qian, with retail households selling out. Suddenly, it was raised by another 2 taels, which was that Yuancheng dragged in hundreds of bars, and at 2:30 it was 89 taels and 8 qian. After that, it was high and low, with one or two taels of change. Between 88 and 89 taels, Chenfeng Yong entered the market to buy at 3:30, which was calculated as 9 taels and 6 qian. Then, it was peaceful, only a few qian up and down, until after 4 o'clock, when a storm arose, because the Indian exchange rate had risen by 5 ounces, the people's hearts were frightened, and Yuanmao, Yongda, Dachen, Yuanheng, Taikang, Runtai, Xingxie, Yujin, and Wupin tended to sell out. In an instant, it plummeted by 5 taels, and at 4:10, it was only 84 taels and 5 qian. At this time, Zhifeng Yong entered again, and it stirred up more than 1 tael, to 86 taels, 1 or 2 qian, but the selling sentiment was still strong, the momentum could not be stopped, and it fell to 84 taels, with only a few qian up and down.

<h3>Public Debt Delivery Today</h3>
<p>The securities exchange in this port, as a rule, delivers all the futures for this month at the end of each month, and today it happens to be the case, so the market will stop auctioning and specialize in handling the delivery procedures, but the silver and money industries, in order to sort out this securities delivery, have pre-arranged the cash exchange heads in order to cope with it. It is said that the delivery amount will reach more than 8 million, and more than half of the customers are pledging funds, so I think there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Public Debt Market is Firm and Stable</h3>
<p>The Market is Closed Today for Delivery</p>

The market was calm before and after, and 6 million yuan was opened. The changes in the prices of each debt were still peaceful due to the imminent delivery at the end of the month, and the unanimous slight rise has been heard.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Was High in the Morning and Flat in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market was up in the morning and flat in the afternoon, but the overseas cotton yarn market has turned upward, and the people in this port are still tired because the bottom goods are too thick, so most of them are pessimistic, and the current yarn sales are more active, and the attitude of both buyers and sellers is calm.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Did Not Sell Well: The human standard opened in the morning market, and the market was firm due to the rising US cotton. Each month rose by 8 qian to 1 tael. In the afternoon, some profit-takers closed out, falling slightly by 2, 3, 4, and 7 qian. The total statistics for the day were 21,500 bales. It was found that Yuda sold 1,300 bales, Gongtai 700 bales, Senkang 900 bales, Jifeng 700 bales, and the rest were 600 or 700 bales. Hengyi bought 1,200 bales, Tianlong 1,700 bales, Yiyu 1,000 bales, and the rest were 500 or</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Trends Upward</h3>
<p>A Stable Situation May Be Difficult to Maintain. Over the past week, the cotton market has seen American cotton continue to rebound, shifting from a state of false weakness to stability. The difference from the low point is more than two taels, a significant change. It is noted that American cotton, due to repeated increases in production and persistently weak consumption, had been trending downward, reaching a ten-year low. Recently, thanks to the government's active publicity and stockpiling, the price has rebounded from one dime to one dime and two cents, and the upward momentum appears to be undiminished. This is because the price base is already low, and the upward trend is stronger. Recalling the period from March to April, the cooperative absorbed May and July futures, causing a rebound of nearly 300 points, but the result was a continued decline due to the relationship between production and consumption. The current situation is similar to the last time, with a force to pull up more than 200 points. However, after the third government estimate was released on October 8, news of favorable weather conditions spread, and the first heavy frost had passed. Reports indicated no significant damage. Furthermore, the sixth cotton ginning report showed 9,252,000 bales, similar to the bumper harvest figures of 1925. This suggests that the condition of the new cotton remains good. The next government estimate (November 8) may show a continuing increase, possibly reaching 14,500,000 bales. Whether the situation can keep pace with the supply is a crucial factor in the trend of the cotton market. Moreover, according to the World Textile Manufacturers Federation's report on global raw cotton consumption, the dominance of American cotton in the world cotton market is showing signs of wavering (the reporter will discuss this separately, so no more on that here). Looking back at the environment, the trend of the cotton market still lacks positive optimism. According to the reporter's assessment, the market is temporarily hovering in a stable position due to artificial maintenance by various parties, awaiting the next government estimate to determine its direction. Chinese cotton has also risen along with American cotton due to the lack of abundant production in various regions and the lack of a surge in arrivals. However, the continued invasion of foreign cotton, and the expected surge in new cotton arrivals in the future, may inevitably lead to another collapse. Furthermore, the pessimistic outlook for the yarn market is undoubtedly related. Therefore, based on the overall trend, the stable situation in the cotton market is likely only temporary.</p>
<p>Han Standard Empty Accounts Compete to Cover. The Han Standard market opened with American cotton rising for several consecutive days, causing panic among short sellers. Those covering their positions rushed in, and the market surged, with all months rising by 3.5 to 5 cents. In the afternoon, some profit-takers closed out their positions, causing a drop of 0.5 to 1 cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 96,400 dans. Public Tai sold 3,500 dans, Yi Kang 4,600 dans, Li Chang 4,100 dans, Yong Feng 3,800 dans, Rui Da 3,000 dans, and the rest 2-3,000 dans. Mei Ji bought 4,800 dans, Yu Da 6,300 dans, Tian Long 7,600 dans, Jin Feng 5,300 dans, Yu Chang 3,000 dans, and the rest 1-2-3,000 dans. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Grains: Continuous Rain, Rice Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Zhabei. Yesterday, the amount of new rice arriving from various areas was not abundant, with only 20 to 30 boats. Sales for each were very smooth. The price for special grade new japonica rice opened at 14.7 yuan, with the market quickly seeing prices tighten by 2 jiao. The price was offered at 14.4 yuan, and transactions were still possible. The prices for medium and lower grades of rice increased by 1 jiao to 0.5 jiao because of the weather and public sentiment. But due to continuous rain, it was not easy to get more river boats. The arrival of Yangjian rice was sparse and sales were brisk, with prices rising by 3 jiao, opening high at 11.5 yuan. Buying interest was extremely high, and it would be difficult for the price of this rice to fall even if the weather cleared. The prices for Dujian rice from the port all rose by 2 jiao. The trend was not as strong as Yangxian rice because of a lack of inquiries from out-of-town merchants. Because the cost of superior quality rice was still very high, most merchants had to sell at a loss, so they asked for an increase of about 2 jiao. Special grade rice needed 10.05 to 10.06 yuan, and white rice had limited sales but was slightly firmer by about 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Hunan. Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived. Sales on this street were not very extensive. The price of Changshu new japonica rice did not rise or fall but hovered around 14 yuan. Only a few retail buyers inquired about Sutong white japonica rice, and public sentiment was consequently flat. Prices were the same as the previous day. Southern route Qingjiao kiln seeds and other new white rice varieties opened high at around 13 yuan, while Liantang and Sijing varieties were not quiet in sales due to their low prices, opening high at over 12.4 yuan, rising by about 1 jiao. Sales of Yangxian rice were average, and sales of Dujian rice were slow. The above market prices did not rise or fall. Silver dollars were extremely scarce, and silver ingots were slightly more affordable. Each price lacked ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Guest Xian Rice Can Be Expected to Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the amount of guest xian rice arriving was not high, and the inventory was also low. The market seemed to have the possibility of a turnaround. However, sales were not brisk, and there were no sales in the local rural areas, so the market was able to level out. A unified market saw merchants from Fuzhou purchase 300 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice early, with prices ranging from 10.075 to 10.45 yuan. Also, local merchants purchased two small carts of Nanjing brown rice, with prices ranging from 8.2 to 8 yuan. Because factories needed brown rice, the market was better than machine-milled rice.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Near and Far Alike Are in Demand</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, each month saw increasing demand. Because delivery for this month was near, short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The highest price reached 2 taels 2 qian 9 fen 2.5 li. November also tightened to 2 taels 3 qian, and the forward months also tightened at the same time. Recently, there was no problem with this month. If the amount of foreign wheat arriving to small factories in the period from January to November was not high, then the short positions would be squeezed. Local merchants were also active in buying both near-term and forward-term flour. Therefore, the prospects look good for now. As a result, this month was 7.5 li better than the previous day, November and December were 1.25 fen better, January was 1.5 fen better, February was 1 fen better, and March was 1.5 fen better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rebound to Cover Shorts</h3>
<p>After wheat futures opened yesterday morning and afternoon, public sentiment was good again. This was because the quoted price of foreign wheat had increased by 3, 4, or 5 jiao. Also, the standard delivery for October, a batch of goods, had been collected by factories. Therefore, the number of contracts would temporarily need to be reduced. Consequently, short sellers outside the industry were eager to cover their positions. For this reason, public sentiment for the forward months tightened, and trading for each month became more active. As a result, November rose 3 fen compared to the previous day, December rose 3 fen, January rose 5 fen, February rose 4 fen, and March rose 4 fen. Spot wheat prices were still good at the factories, and each grade of wheat increased by 7 to 8 fen. Shandong, Yaowan, Xinyangzhou, Gaoyou wheat, Jiangbei wheat, and Qingjiangpu wheat totaling more than 7,000 bags were purchased by Fufeng and Xinda.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Futures Gradually Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean market for each period was initially very flat and weak. Due to the lingering effects of the previous day, various parties continued to sell, so prices at the morning opening all fell by 4 or 5 fen. When the market opened in the afternoon, oil factory merchants started to buy, and the situation gradually stabilized as the gold market improved. Later, the Dalian telegram arrived in Shanghai with slightly firm news, so local merchants stopped selling, and each price rose slightly. As a result, the December contract was 4 taels 5 qian 8 fen, and the January contract was 5 qian 7 fen, both down 2 fen. The February contract was 4 taels 6 qian 1 fen, and the March contract was 6 qian 5 fen, both unchanged.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Factory Opens Another 50,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Market Allocations All Show Turnaround Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams reported that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.46875, a decrease of 0.03125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for December were 1.44, down 0.05. March of next year was 1.52, also down 0.06. May was 1.57, and September was 1.70, each down 0.07. The price of Java spot sugar was 8.125, and the price of November and December futures was 8 guilders, unchanged from before. The association's market allocation showed that Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sand had a special factory announcement of a price increase of 0.5 guilders, and public sentiment turned stronger. Sellers disappeared, and buyers still wanted to purchase, with the price reaching 7 taels 8 qian, and the highest price reaching 7 taels 9 qian. Although transactions were still scarce, the market was very firm. No. 20 medium white sand was 6 taels 8 qian, and No. 8 Dutch red was 6 taels 3 qian 5 fen. The market was relatively flat. The Japanese sugar market also turned upward. Minghua YRO mark was 7 taels 3 qian 5 fen, YT mark was 7 taels 6 qian 5 fen, and TK mark was 7 taels 7 qian 5 fen, each up 0.05. YP mark was 7 taels 8 qian 5 fen to 7 taels 9 qian, an increase of 0.1 qian. The market looked lively. The factory allocation of Minghua sugar opened at 30,000 bags, with a price of 5.8 Japanese gold yuan. Meiji sugar opened at 20,000 bags, with a price of 4.6 yuan. The delivery period was December and January of next year. Merchants were very eager to purchase and sold out completely, and there was a shortage of supply. The market was 0.1 yuan higher than the previous allocation, and the market was also strong. The trademarked Bingchang company sold spot No. 20 medium white sand for 3,012 bags at a price of 6 taels 8 qian yuan. Also, the company sold 2,000 bags of No. 8 Dutch red sugar arriving on the 2nd of next month at a price of 6 taels 3 qian 5 fen yuan. Demand was very strong, and the market looked very firm.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Peach Meat Market Stable</h3>
<p>Recently, dried peach meat has arrived in succession. Market inventory is not high. According to letters, the prices in Tianjin and Hankou have not risen or fallen much. Sales here have been carried out by local merchants, as well as those from Jiahu, Changshu, and other regions. The trend is stable. Yesterday, the market price for Tianjin dried peach meat was 40 taels, and the next best was 38 taels. Yan dried peach meat was 34 to 35 taels.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Squid Production Area Reports a Price Increase of 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to inquiries, the production of squid in Hakodate and Tsushima has been affected by the lack of winter water in the ocean, and the arrival of goods is even more lacking than in the autumn. Therefore, the price in the production area has increased by 2 yuan. Although sales to Shanghai have not been active, merchants' costs are high, and the marked price has increased. Therefore, the price has not increased. Yesterday, the price for full Qing large sheet Hakodate autumn water squid was 44 taels 7 qian, uniform sheet unified goods were 43 taels 1 qian to 42 taels 6 qian, winter water Chaozhou goods were 42 taels 2 qian, oil-mixed sheet was 40 taels 3 qian, full oil sheet was 38 taels, and Yulin sheet was 35 taels 5 qian. A total of 139 pieces were sold. It is said that merchants still have more than 100 pieces remaining and are not selling them for the time being, waiting to see how the production area market changes before deciding what to do.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Factories Wire Transfer Prices Drastically Rise</h3>
<p>Factories Still Say Silk Costs Are Insufficient, Negotiations Are Difficult</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in Shanghai suddenly trended upward. According to inquiries, silk weaving factories in New York, seeing that the price of silk from Chinese and Japanese factories had fallen to the lowest level, took the opportunity to purchase spring raw materials. In addition, the exchange rate was tight, so the price of silk drastically rose. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson received a telegram from New York stating that Shanghai white factory silk had risen by 30 to 40 taels. Each factory still says silk costs are insufficient and is firmly continuing to raise prices before selling. A deal has yet to be reached.</p>
<h3>Marseille Long Filature Prices Drastically Rise</h3>
<p>Silk weaving factories actively purchase spring raw materials, prices up 2-3 francs</p>
<p>The Shanghai silk market for long filature silk has been trending firmer since silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang collectively agreed to suspend operations, and silk production has been decreasing daily. Yesterday, French firms received a telegram from Marseille stating that each silk weaving factory, seeing that Chinese and Japanese silk factories had suspended operations and the supply was gradually decreasing, began to actively purchase spring raw materials. The inventory was scarce, and market prices drastically rose. The current market price for superior grade Shanghai silk factory long filature is 85 francs per kilogram, an increase of 2-3 francs.</p>
<h3>Gaozhuang Zhenmei Actively Sold in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from sources such as Tunxi continued to be purchased by companies such as Xiehe, Jardine Matheson, Yongxing, and Tianxiang, and transactions were not quiet. The top price for Tunxi drawn core goods was 200 taels. The top price for ordinary Zhenmei was 132 taels. Xiamu pearl tea was slightly in demand by companies such as Jardine Matheson and Duder, but the price they were willing to pay was extremely low. The Association still intended to increase or decrease the price of Gongxi green tea and Qimen black tea. Sales of medium and low grade goods remained sluggish.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Sales Sluggish, Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>The plunge in white tung oil prices in recent days has been unprecedented. Wholesale prices at foreign firms have fallen from 26 taels to 15 taels 6 qian, a difference of 30 taels compared to the 46 taels high in 1916. Even compared to the usual market price, it has fallen by more than half. Zhejiang tung oil has also fallen by 7 yuan and is only selling for 27 yuan. The reason for the price drop is purely due to sluggish foreign sales and a large stockpile of oil. Although cargo owners have repeatedly lowered prices, transactions are difficult to complete. With the autumn season of abundant production and stagnant foreign sales, there is a fear that after the major price drop, there will be further price declines.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Autumn Rain Affects Hardware Loading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the autumn rain drizzling, export merchants were all hesitant to load hardware, fearing that the hardware would be damaged by water stains and affect sales. As a result, the amount of hardware offered in the market was even more scarce. Although sales of various scrap iron items were usually brisk, sales were also unusually low yesterday. However, asking prices were higher due to the exchange rate situation. Even blue lead bars, which had been declining sharply, rose by 1 qian yesterday and were selling for 14 taels 4 qian 5 fen. Two-hundred-pound company iron rose by 2 qian 5 fen and was selling for 21 taels 7 qian 5 fen. It is said that canneries purchased 600-700 boxes yesterday, and the market supply is very scarce, so the outlook is good. The amount of tinplate offered was limited, but fortunately there were no market changes. There were still few buyers for nails, so it was still difficult for the market to recover.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Merchants Purchase 500 Dans of Spot Tin</h3>
<p>The spot tin market has been sluggish for a long time, so there have not been any major transactions in the market for a long time. Earlier, Fuhao, Lengsheng, and other Shaoxing merchants purchased 500 bars of spot tin. Buying interest in the market was strong for a time. Although market prices did not improve, it felt much firmer than before.</p>

<h3>Escaped and Returned! To Calm the Nerves</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Because of Didi's earnest sincerity, I couldn't refuse, so on this silvery moonlit night, I rushed to Wusong.</p>
<p>Originally, I planned to see the sunrise. Wusong is a very suitable place to watch the sunrise. Someone had told us beforehand that when the morning sun rises, it will rise and fall more than ten times. The poetic situation is difficult to describe, so I was also happily moved by this painting of the morning sun. But when I woke up the next day, the strong sunlight had already sealed directly in from the glass window, and I couldn't help but feel disappointed. When I put on my clothes and looked out at the sea, the blood-red fireball was more than twenty feet above the sea. This caused our planned plan to fail. Later, Didi got up, and he told me that he had actually gotten up once at four o'clock when the east was still not white, but because the autumn wind was too strong, he was afraid I would get cold, so he didn't wake me up, and went back to sleep. Ah, Didi's deep affection is really enough to make me grateful.</p>
<p>However, playing is still playing. Our interest in playing is still so strong. After breakfast, after taking care of some miscellaneous matters, we discussed exploring the lighthouse.</p>
<p>The autumn wind was indeed strong, blowing head-on, making me gasp from time to time. The withering atmosphere of nature and the withered tones couldn't help but assault our thoughts, and we couldn't help but feel chilled and uneasy. Oh, how solemn and sad this late autumn is to people's hearts. We walked along the banks of the Huangpu River, the dust and sand flying fiercely. If a car or something like that passed by, we simply had to stop, turn sideways, and avoid it. We walked hand in hand, talking and laughing, and before we knew it, we were near the riverbank.</p>
<p>The sunlight reflected on the water, emitting a colorful luster. Looking ahead, one side is the Yangtze River, and one hundred is the East China Sea. In the middle, Chongming Island is vaguely revealed on the surface of the water.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Looking across the Yangtze River, it's just a white wave and a seam separating the water and the sky. Towards the East China Sea, beyond Sanjia Water, it's also the same vast expanse of white. What punctuates it are only ships. In addition, it is the so-called interesting contrast between water and sky. We don't know whether it was intentional or melancholy that we looked into the distance for a while, and then followed the road to catch up with the road to the lighthouse.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is about thirty feet away from the shore. Large square stones made of mountain stones and concrete are piled up in a mess to form a road, connecting the lighthouse and the shore. We walked with big strides, sometimes shrugging our shoulders, but leisurely resting often, or looking into the distance, or talking and laughing, truly forgetting the so-called fatigue of life, and indulging in our heroic interest.</p>
<p>—To let the sea breeze blow on our chests, to completely blow away all the accumulated depression, so that our lungs are like being washed by a pure dew, this is so interesting. Ah, gentle sea breeze, blow so refreshingly, blow, let us bathe, bathe in your embrace.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but stretch out my hand, facing the slowly fanning sea breeze, and said to Didi,</p>
<p>—Yes, Didi also said sympathetically, this is really enough for people to enjoy. If it could be like this every day, it would be truly happy.</p>
<p>We walked forward unconsciously, and before long, the lighthouse was very clear. The lighthouse cannot be climbed. It is still more than a foot away from the embankment. We saw that the destination was about to arrive, naturally infinitely happy, but suddenly a voice came to warn us, making us stand still in shock.</p>
<p>—You go back quickly, the tide is rising very fiercely.</p>
<p>So we carefully identified where the voice came from. It turned out that the boatman on a small sampan parked next to the lighthouse was waving to warn us. In this way, we immediately paid attention to the tide. We saw that the upper reaches of the Yangtze River were surging down, much higher than before. But we still calmly observed the structure and form of the lighthouse, although we were already starting to worry in our hearts.</p>
<p>We came back almost running. However, it was impossible to come. We only ran five or six feet, and the stones in the lower part were already immersed in water, blocking the road. At this time, the waves surged, hitting the rocks, splashing waves, and the shoes were wet. At first, we were not afraid of getting wet and tried to cross over on the high stones, but in less than ten steps, almost all the stones in front were immersed in water, with only a few corners exposed, and the tidal waves were even more turbulent, making us unable to help but be afraid, so we stood still, on the stones a foot above the water surface. In fact, we really didn't understand the water flood. I also thought that the tide would recede soon, and would not rise any higher.</p>
<p>—Let's just stand here, I said. Since we can't leave now, then we can only wait for the tide to go back. I think it will be at most one or two hours. Anyway, it's good, let's just watch the tide here.</p>

<p>—Photographed by Hua</p>
<p>At this time, I became optimistic instead. I didn't know that the danger was right in front of me.</p>
<p>—Really, we can sigh at the river today, Didi echoed.</p>
<p>But the tide was still rising, and the stones we were standing on were also unstable, having been washed by the waves several times. This gradually made me anxious, thinking about what would happen if it rose again, but at this time, I couldn't use words to comfort Didi.</p>
<p>—It's okay for the two of us to stand together. Even if the water rises again, it won't rise too high.</p>
<p>—Even if it's not good—, we will die together,</p>
<p>Didi said with a smile. I heard it, and my heart couldn't help but fluctuate, almost bursting into tears. Our hands couldn't help but grip each other more tightly.</p>
<p>Silence joined us. We seemed to be tacitly agreeing. I started to pay attention to the way back. Only a few stones exposed their corners above the water surface, and our surroundings were almost completely a world of water. We seemed to be floating, playing water games, like duckweed on the water, about to drift with the wind and waves.</p>
<p>The situation became tense little by little. We saw that the situation was not right, so we decided to get a boat to ferry us. We saw a ship passing by, so we shouted, but jokingly, the people on the ship saw us and thought we were just having fun, and did not lower any lifeboats. But our feet were about to be submerged in a marsh. So, seeing that we couldn't go down any further, we waved to the sampan parked next to the lighthouse, indicating that we wanted them to rescue us. Sure enough, they raised their sails and set off. We couldn't help but laugh wildly at each other, feeling the humor of this trip. When the boat approached, we jumped up, and the boatman was unusually kind. He saw our embarrassed situation, comforted us warmly, and asked,</p>
<p>—Where did you come from?</p>
<p>—From Wusong,</p>
<p>—Are you from the Marine Products School?</p>
<p>—No,</p>
<p>Ah... So you don't understand the tide. This is really dangerous. These days are the spring tides, and the tide rises a foot every half hour until you are submerged.</p>
<p>—Then at what time will it recede?</p>
<p>—At least five o'clock. Next time, if you don't know the tide, don't come, the boatman sincerely told us.</p>
<p>I turned back and smiled at Didi and said,</p>
<p>—Today is really a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>Talking like this, the boat had landed. We gave them some money for wine and escaped ashore, our hearts still beating fast. We comforted each other and sat down on the ground to take off our shoes and socks to dry.</p>
<p>When we looked back at the road to the lighthouse, the water had formed a sheet. So we sighed for a while and gave our blessings.</p>
<p>Returning to Wusong, the sun had left its central position. We went to a restaurant and each bought a pound of wine.</p>
<p>—Let's make an exception and drink more. This is our calming wine.</p>

<h3>Recent Spanish Literary Scene</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Best Book Club of the Month</p>
<p>The Death of Miro</p>
<p>Reading clubs, which have been very popular in England and the United States in recent years, have become popular in Spain. Madrid now also has such an organization, called the "Best Book Club of the Month" (Asociacion del Major Libro del Mes). However, unlike others, this reading club is not a disguised publishing organization, but an important group in the Spanish literary scene. Because its hosts are all modern Spanish literary giants, their selection and criticism are certainly enough to attract national attention, and contain serious implications. Therefore, if a writer's new work is selected, it is extremely beneficial to the author's own value and status. The important figures who host this reading club are as follows: Azorin, E. Diaz Canodo, Pedro Saing Rodriguez, Ramon Perezz de Ayak, Ricardo Baeza, Jose M. Salaverria, Rafael Altamia, and Gabrel Mirs. These are all important figures in the modern Spanish literary scene. Among them, Miro has recently passed away, and Miro's death has shocked and saddened the Spanish literary world.</p>
<h3>Gasset, a Nationalist Writer</h3>
<p>Longing for the Rebirth of the Spanish Nation</p>
<p>Gasset's (Jose Ortega J. Gasset) seventh volume of "The Spectator" (El Espeotador) has recently been published, and is one of the new books selected by this reading club. This is a collection of essays, and the nature of the topics is very uneven, from "Hegel and America" to "The South American Plains," all of which are discussed. Gasset is very knowledgeable about German philosophy. He said, "Hegel is the emperor of the thought world, the champion of scholars." However, he admitted that Hegel's shortcoming is that he cannot explain the history in formation. He does not understand the future of America. This is what Gasset discussed in his essay "Hegel and America." Moreover, Gasset said that Hegel's masterpiece "Philosophy of History" still has no translation in France and Spain, which is really a shame for the academic and publishing circles of these two countries. Therefore, he announced that he would soon translate this book into Spanish. In addition, in the essay "The Rise of Estdan" (Origen Deprortivo del Estado), he traced Spain's past military achievements, and as in his famous book "Invertebrate Spain" (España Invertebrada), he encouraged modern Spanish youth to use their activities for purposes that are more valuable than sports and games. Gasset is clearly a Spanish nationalist writer. He sees himself living in this lifeless era, and he feels extremely painful. He longs for the old courage and vitality of the Spanish people to flourish again. He found that Argentina and those Pampao (plains) are full of vitality, inhabited by the most enterprising people of all nations. These people all have strong primitive impulses, a fervent will to survive, and a magnificent human will. These all foreshadow that they will have a strong future and will achieve a lofty position in history.</p>
<h3>Ramon Latre's Views</h3>
<p>Spain is Not a Masculine Nation</p>
<p>Completely different in nature from Gasset's new book is Ramon Latre's interesting "Why Spaniards Have Not Achieved More" (Por que El Esqanol No Ha Llegado a Mas). His theory is very unique and very interesting. He said that because emigration and war have made the number of women in Spain much larger than the number of men, Spain is not a masculine nation (like the Anglo-Saxon nation), but a feminine nation. According to Latre, a masculine nation requires people of the same nation to be monarchs, while a feminine nation, like Spain, submits to the rule of foreigners. They Spain has never ruled other countries. Sicily and Naples were not conquered by the Spanish. The Aragon royal family went to the former because they got the consent of its people, and to the latter because they got the consent of its queen. Latre admits that Spaniards have one masculine trait: their resistance to Napoleon, and one feminine impulse: creating what is called "Spanish America" (Hispamerica, referring to the countries of South America). He denies that the creation of these "Spanish America" countries can indicate the Spanish people's conquest, estilo hsmbra (masculine style). He believes that this is only an expression of rich productivity, the so-called estilo hembra (feminine style). Moreover, he said that these countries were not conquered by the Spanish, but only ruled by the Spanish. Therefore, the subsequent separation from Spain is not a sign of Spain's decline. He cannot find any decline or decline in this Spanish race, but it is not ambitious enough and has limited vitality. But he believes that according to the methods he proposed, this shortcoming can be avoided.</p>
<p>From these words, we can know that Latre is a person who has special research on women. But unfortunately, he is a misogynist. His attitude towards women is the attitude of a misogynist, thin and contemptuous. Therefore, his book "Why Spain Has Not Achieved More" will certainly not be welcomed by the Spanish women's world, because Latre actually said honestly that physically, a woman is just a machine for creating human beings, and spiritually, she has nothing. The most enthusiastic thing in her life is to transform the exterior of her body into an exquisite chest of drawers. Her only history is the transformation in this chest of drawers, because she needs nothing but decoration. Women can eat bad things and live casually, but men, because of their mental and physical labor, need abundant food, excellent living conditions, and comfortable rest. Latre also said that Spanish mothers dote on their sons, making them all feminine. Women are the heads of households, but because they themselves are docile, they also pass on this docile habit to their descendants.</p>
<h3>The Prevailing Period of Essays</h3>
<p>The recent Spanish literary scene is a prevailing period of essays. Muncio's (Angel Dotor Y Muncio) new book is also a collection of essays, entitled "Mirador," which discusses modern Spanish articles and art, and can indeed shed light on this aspect. His chapter on Cervantes worship has a detailed discussion of Spanish essays involving the immortal "Don Qulxote." In addition, he has very precise criticisms of contemporary Spanish literary and artistic figures.</p>
<p>Castro's (Americo Castro) new book is also a collection of essays, called "Santa Teresa Y. Otors Ensayos," which is also a book about literature and history. Santa Teresa was a 16th-century Spanish female writer. According to Castro, although the great writers of the time, such as Cervantes, Lope de Vega, and Calderon, all had many readers, Santa Teresa's books were even more popular. Her works can be considered the most complete representative of the Castilian language in the 16th century. In addition, several essays in Castro's book discuss academic issues, about Spanish history or literature. Because of the author's broad knowledge, these essays are very meaningful.</p>
<p>The Spanish are now shouting for the revival of Spain, and are trying their best to connect this 20th-century revival with their traditions. Therefore, starting in the spring of this year, a very noteworthy new quarterly has been published in Madrid, Erudicion Ibero Ultramarina. The purpose of this review is to advocate the revival of Spain, while exploring Spain's past. The selectors are all famous Spanish scholars and writers. The three issues that have been published contain a total of more than 500 pages, and the content is very rich and the printing is exquisite. Each issue has about 20 pages of book reviews, and a column dedicated to Spanish art. In this column, in addition to articles, some less common Spanish paintings are inserted. The three issues have published a total of thirteen. For those who study Spanish culture, this magazine is indeed an indispensable good material.</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Shaw's Complete Works and Preface</h3>
<p>— Fu Lan</p>
<p>Shaw's complete works are printed in a very limited number, only one thousand and twenty-five copies. Each copy contains thirty volumes, costing thirty-one pounds and a half. In other words, the people who are currently ordering this book will pay a total of thirty-two thousand two hundred and eighty-seven pounds and a half, which is equivalent to five or six hundred thousand Chinese dollars. Its price cannot be said to be affordable. According to Shaw, who was recently interviewed by a newspaper reporter, "This book is only sold to fools and speculators." Perhaps Shaw has the courage to announce the names of those who ordered the books.</p>
<p>On the first volume of this book, there is an autobiographical preface by Shaw, which writes his own life story very faithfully, starting from his infancy, and then coming to London at the age of twenty to work as a bookkeeper for eighteen shillings a month, until the period when he wrote a novel that no publisher was willing to accept for publication.</p>
<p>Speaking of his unsociability, when he first came to the city, he also described his father.</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>said,</p>
<p>"Unfortunately,... my father had a habit of only knowing how to close the doors and windows, and even prevented my mother from being properly invited. If there were no him,... if you invited him to dinner or a tea party, he would often be sober at the start, but would definitely leave drunk as mud... In the end, we became more and more estranged from society day by day."</p>
<p>"After I passed my childhood, I was never able to visit my relatives' homes. If my father and mother went out to dinner or attended appointments, their children were alone at home, and the fear in their hearts was worse than a house on fire. My mother was lucky to have her musical talent, which greatly helped her escape this predicament. And my father gradually moved from theory to practice in terms of temperance, because he had a spasm on the steps of my house one Sunday afternoon and fell to the ground, thus realizing that he must abstain from drinking, otherwise he would die."</p>
<p>"However, his reform was too late and could not save his social status, and I was even more at a loss as to how to socialize."</p>
<p>After Shaw's article was published, Dr. Cullier, the former president of the Baptist Church, recently gave a speech in Folkestone, saying that Shaw's description of his father's drinking was very faithful, but said, "If Shaw can make a valuable statement on this level, it is easy for us to forgive the issue of his politeness, but we would rather he not have a family profile. Why does he expose the facts of his father nakedly as a defense for his own shortcomings?"</p>
<p>Later, Shaw was informed by a reporter from a newspaper and replied to the reporter, "From his point of view, I certainly have no politeness. The good politeness in the ideal of a Baptist pastor is certainly something I cannot reach. I have described my father very faithfully. Anyone can see everything from me. I think it is better for me to tell my own story than for a Baptist to overstep his bounds."</p>
<h3>Flowers by the Roadside</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>"In the morning, a girl from Yue Creek; in the evening, a concubine in the Wu Palace." This is a Chinese poem lamenting the fleeting fate of beautiful women. Although Xi Shi was discovered and brought into the palace of the King of Wu, countless other roadside flowers, scattered by the Yue Creek, remained unknown. This is a common lament of poets throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Here, I write about a roadside flower from the Parisian music scene. Her past is just like that of an unappreciated Yue girl by the Washing Silk Creek.</p>
<p>In the bright, southern European city of Paris, Parisians, lightly dressed, would happily stroll during early summer evenings, or take a short break in cafes filled with the haze of tobacco smoke and cheerful laughter.</p>
<p>The cafes, filled with whispers, whistling, and the clatter of cups and plates, featured a young singing voice every night. This singer, with her exotic appearance and charm, possessed a strong allure, making people forget about going home and lingering to listen.</p>
<p>This wandering songstress, no one knew where she lived. Only the young people who heard her sing would crazily wait for her every night at the cafe, some even following her from one cafe to another.</p>
<p>"I... I was born in Venice, the daughter of a boatman, growing up on the water. I have no surname."</p>
<p>She would always cheerfully answer those who asked her. An Italian girl, a boatman's daughter, growing up on the water—those who heard these self-descriptions would each imagine in their minds a warm summer night, the slowly flowing, mirror-like water, and the romantic tugging of bowstrings. It seemed as if she brought with her the fragrance and color held by that poetic southern land.</p>
<p>One day, she suddenly disappeared. Her beautiful voice was no longer heard in the cafes, nor was her bright smile seen again. The young patrons became depressed. Only the gloomy sound of cups and plates remained in the cafes. Everyone seemed to have lost their strength in the darkness. Everyone talked only about the sudden disappearance of the singer.</p>
<p>"That girl really left with a gentleman."</p>
<p>"A gentleman?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a very respectable gentleman, but not young, past middle age." They gossiped like this, but no one knew her true news.</p>
<p>"What happened to that Italian girl?"</p>
<p>Such questions were often asked, but accompanied by a collective sigh of disappointment, no one answered anymore. Months passed like this.</p>
<p>One day, everyone suddenly rejoiced, shouting as if they had found some treasure:</p>
<p>"Go to the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens!"</p>
<p>"Go to the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens!"</p>
<p>Shouting this phrase, like water, they rushed from the cafes to the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens.</p>
<p>The Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens was a theater that reached its peak in the late eighteenth century, in Paris.</p>
<p>The Italian girl, whose figure had disappeared from the cafes since summer, suddenly appeared on this stage. Parisians, who had been lonely for so long, were, needless to say, happy to see her appear. Even other spectators, hearing her beautiful voice, could not help but marvel and praise her.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a boatman's daughter, a wandering songstress, had leaped to become a flower of the Parisian art scene. In one night, she made all of Paris remember her new stage name, "Prima Donna."</p>
<p>On her last night singing in the cafe, as she walked out, a respectable gentleman noticed her. This gentleman was the manager of the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens. He had an exceptional passion for her beautiful voice. That very night, he took her to the theater.</p>
<p>From a wandering girl, she became a lucky flower on the Parisian stage, just like a roadside flower that is appreciated by someone, instantly increasing in value a hundredfold. Her name is Podi.</p>
<h3>The Emotionless Greeks</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>Go-Tal, Victoria, was a famous dancer of the past, truly the leading figure in the dance world at the time. He was also very confident, once boasting,</p>
<p>"Europe has only three truly great figures: Frederick the Great of Prussia, Vitelli, and myself."</p>
<p>Therefore, he looked down on everyone. At that time, in the music world, "Gluck," who held a great influence and was revered as the god of music, was only seen by him as a music student. Once, "Go-Tal" needed a new score for his dance, but he came to "Gluck," whom he considered a mere student.</p>
<p>"Compose a Greek dance piece for me. This..."</p>
<p>"A Greek dance piece... Understood. What kind of piece do you want?"</p>
<p>"Well, but, Gluck, I want you to write a Chaconne (a type of ancient Spanish dance that originated in 1591, flourished in the 18th century, and is now obsolete). Can you do that? Hey..."</p>
<p>"A Chaconne," Gluck, annoyed by his arrogance, calmly replied, "A Chaconne? Didn't you say you wanted music for a Greek dance? Do you think the ancient Greeks knew about this Chaconne musical form? In reality, ancient Greece did not have such a thing."</p>
<p>Speaking these words coldly like a sword, Go-Tal, who considered himself one of the three great men of Europe, could only stammer:</p>
<p>"What? Didn't know? Didn't know the Chaconne? Hmph... Not knowing the Chaconne, those Greeks are truly an emotionless people."</p>
<p>Due to the failure of this negotiation, in Go-Tal's entire dancing career, he could not find a piece by Gluck. (Su)</p>
