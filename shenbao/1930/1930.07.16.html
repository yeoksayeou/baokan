<h3 id="c8">意飛行家散放傳單之交涉 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>意飛行家巴薩尼斯。乘法飛機在聖古特哈冰河觸山毁機一事。極尋常事耳。意人因查知該機。即爲往米蘭散發反棒喝黨傳單之機。於是大起驚疑。又查知該機之護照。係由法國發結。傳單係由瑞士供給。於是又對法瑞兩國。大爲憤慨。其報紙直斥巴黎爲反棒喝黨罪惡之中樞。瑞士爲其第二策源地。并謂此案將發生嚴重結果。如苟損及吾意大利利益。惟有修改友好盟約。其意氣之憤憤不平。幾有莫可遏止之勢。然其實此事亦甚易諒解。巴氏之領取航空執照。當時係諉稱赴瑞士參加國際航空競賽。故法方不疑而給之。該機到瑞士後。在斐倫淑邦附近一小飛行塲。由一運貨汽車。密送傳單於機上。故亦未爲塲員所覺。此種疏忽失察。亦爲情理上所常有之事。且駛機散傳單者。又爲意人而非法瑞人。一旦說明。宜無不可渙然冰釋者。乃意人竟一再攻擊恫嚇。視爲莫大仇怨。何也。蓋凡事兩方向無意見者。易於解釋。苟有意見。則隨時可發生疑慮誤會與藉口。即一極細微之事。亦可釀成極嚴重之狀態。意法之　。近方爲海軍造艦問題。邦交上發生隔閡。意人對法之懷疑。愈積愈甚。而反棒喝之舉。又爲意人所深忌。遂不問事態之眞相如何。而毅然借以發洩耳。據今日巴黎電訊。現法國南方沿意法邊境一帶。軍警戒備甚嚴。各城均在準備防禦天空襲擊之工作。謡言蠭起。情勢之緊張如是。皆由於向來意見鬱積之故。不然區區一飛機散發傳單事。何致釀成若斯之事態耶</p>

<p>菲島沾染歐風。男女敎育。平等發達。女子在社會上。亦佔有相當地位。堪稱爲東方女權最發達之國。不謂數月來。社會上發生女名流謀弑親夫案。爲一般人所注意。每當法庭開審。旁聽席幾無立足地。翌日各日報則用大號字粒。競在第一版刊登此事。現經初級審判所判决。似巳稍告一結束。惟其事甚趣不可不介紹於自由談讀者。</p>
<p>此案當事人。原告菲人名李橈。操律師業。下屆在菲島一省中。極有希望競爭省長之一人。其夫人爲中央女子大學校長之妹。其資格爲女律師兼製藥師。并在中央大學任敎職。夫婦結褵十餘年。其長子巳十五歲。不料今年三月二十四夜李橈在家中。竟被人謀殺。受傷而不致命。檢察官根據各方面口詞及證據。提出刑事公訴。其理由（一）兇手供稱夫人許以二百元爲報酬。（二）載兇手之車夫。曾見當夜兇手近原告住屋下車時。有一與夫人身材相同之婦女。以手招之入内。（三）偵探在起事屋中樓梯旁拾有紙片。上寫「彼巳睡但未熟睡」等字樣。在法庭經騐筆跡專家者證明。係夫人所書。而該紙片所址下之紙簿係在夫人妝台内搜得。且該探又供當拾得紙片時。夫人許以五百元贖回。（四）受傷者所臥房中有兩面照身鏡。均用化學品塗抹使之糢糊。顯係防律師在榻上能從鏡中察見兇手入室作用。更最重要證據。即主犯係車夫。供與夫人發生戀愛。其慘案爲夫人所主使。蓋此不正當之秘密關係發生在去年七月間。原告曾將車夫辭歇一次。因夫人之請求。謂其子喜該車夫。故再起用也。</p>
<h3 id="c115">人名誌趣程·與·青 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>胡適···那兒去</p>
<p>方還···才回來</p>
<p>新文學家胡適二字之解釋。即國語中之「那兒去」也。舊文學家方還二字之意義。即白話中之「才回來」也。記得有一天。某政客設宴。胡方均在被邀之列。到後忽又相繼辭去。席間因討論某項問題。擬請胡方發表意見。或問曰。胡適胡適。（那兒去）方還胡適。（那兒去）主人答曰。胡適不知適矣。方還則方還（才回來）也。衆賓鬨堂大笑。於是胡適方還。遂傳爲美談云。</p>
<p>其案於最近判决。法官之判决書。計五十餘頁。蓋不僅就法律提出具體證據。并從情理上斷定夫人有謀殺親夫行爲。（一）夫人聞其夫呼救。竟躱於浴室中。不出援助。（二）到見其夫滿身鮮血淋漓。亦不現驚駭悲傷之容。只作漠不相干之規諷。勸其夫脫離政治關係。（三）其夫赴醫院時。其子偕往。彼不同行。凡此種種情形。在恩愛深切之夫婦間。都覺不近情理。實令人難解。使非有與謀害其夫隠情。對此慘劇。决不至表現此種冷淡態度。由是無情之法律。竟判夫人坐監十二年。爰書巳定。鐵案難移矣。</p>
<p>但夫人態度十分鎭定。判書已下。經預備向高級法庭上訴。并對報館訪事云。伊良心純是潔白無愧。下級法官。縱至錯誤。上級法院。有許多法官審理此案。假使在壤間尚有公道。伊定可宣告無罪。其言詞從容如此。誠不愧女中名流也。</p>
<p>至原告對其夫人之態度。初在法庭。謂平時伉儷甚篤。並無勃谿反目等事。固不信其妻有此慘酷手段者。後經偵探搜出種種證據。始同意提出公訴。其目的亦欲藉法律以息浮言。不料該案竟以實現謀殺親夫罪名。此後須再候高等法院下判詞。方能斷定。然家庭之間。禍起肘腋。亦可見夫婦之道苦矣。</p>

<p>記者在大阪逗遛未足一日。即忽促乘車赴東京。曾君衍華則遄返神戸。擔任中國選手團東來歡迎事宜。對於大阪名勝未克瀏覽。僅至大阪朝日新聞社參觀一過。後此雖擬俟遠東運動會閉幕後。重遊斯土。卒亦未償所願。至今猶有餘恨。幸在阪時曾晤本報駐阪記者阮君蔚村。述大阪情形極詳。關於華僑現况更爲明瞭。本篇所載。大抵均阮君之言也。大阪歷史頗古。最初稱大江。應神天皇時（約二千年前）改稱高津。設城址。明治初葉。高津始易名爲大阪府。後設市。維新後開港。大阪府管下分三市。即大阪市尼崎市及堺市是。大阪市又分十三區。每區設一市役所大阪府周圍約有華里二百四十餘里。大阪之工商業在全球。占極重要地位。世界市塲中所見之日貨。十分之六七係大阪出品。其大宗輸出品爲棉紗棉布。每年輪出額約值四五萬萬元日金。大阪設有三品交易所。爲東亞棉紗棉花行市之來源。此外各種工廠林立。造船廠有五家。均能承造萬噸以上之巨輪。紡紗廠最多。規模最大者曰鐘淵。數百萬元資本之銀行有二百餘家。航業方面以大阪爲中心者。有大阪商船公司。資本初僅一億元。與吾國之招商局同年創辦。但因營業歷年發展。現在勢力較招商雄厚十倍。共有巨輪一百八十餘艘。總計載重在四十萬噸以上。航線普及全球。大阪名勝最著名者有天王寺。寳塜。箕面。浜寺。大濱。住吉公園等。另有一事殊有注意之價值。即大阪府下設一極大之兵工廠。創辦於明治初葉。日俄戰後。大加擴充。現有工人兩萬餘名。製造最新式出品。足與世界各大名廠抗衡。迄今猶畫夜兼工。現大阪城内。子彈庫觸目皆是。儲藏之富。槪可想見。日人計畫之遠。用心之深。亦足以窺見其一斑矣。就軍備而言。駐紮大阪者有陸軍第四師。外憲兵一團。此爲平時之兵力。一旦有事。大阪在鄕軍人（即退伍之義務兵）十五萬。及青年團等總計可調二十萬人。</p>
<p>國日報爲黨部所辦。銷數最廣。晚報則有江西晚報。午後五句鐘後出現。</p>
<p>民衆之娱樂戲館有新興舞臺。地址在鐘鼓樓。男女合演。除舊劇外。兼演海派連串新戲。以資號召。最低價目。爲大洋兩角。電影院爲樂羣及江西兩家。皆開映國産影片。又有先聲游藝塲。方於上月四日開幕。樓高四層。内中百戲雜陳。南北咸備。如滬上之大世界新世界然。游客除門票外。尚須另加敎育費銅元十枚。贛人之熱心敎育。槪可知矣。</p>
<p>公園之建設百花洲少林壑之趣。祇見假山點綴。平時洲中亦中輕舟容與。惟夏季則水涸。現巳改建中山公園。刻意經營。用人工製造。雖至長夏。亦使碧水成渠。以比美於西湖焉。</p>

<p>（未）東京市上下水道設施水爲人類生活之要素。關係市民飮料及市政消防并農村之作業甚鉅。日爲島國。環水以居。其上下水道之設施。經三百餘年之擘劃經營。無時或息。現截至昭和三年十二月末日止。全市之給水戸數。己達三十三萬八千七百六十九戸。給水人口。己達二百零七萬五百零五人。每年平均之給水總量。己達一億三千八百十一萬八千一百九十一立方米之多。</p>
<p>（一）上水道設施上水道設施。發源於德川家康時之家臣大久保主水氏之市外井之頭清泉之導引。嗣經四代將軍家綱時代。及清右衛門氏等之逐漸改進。遂日臻完備。現在上水道之水源地。係多摩川之流域。關於水源地附近之開發。又水質惡化。及不潔物之防止。己有三河島污水處分塲。曁塵芥處理塲等多所之設立。又飮用水之試騐。及惡疫流行之預防。又火災塲消火用之精密設備等。如貯水池之調節。及水路全部暗渠并隧道防止蒸發或滲漏之工事。又市内通水唧筒之分配。均在在綱舉目張。有條不紊。現查全市之一日平均給水量。爲三十七萬七千三百七十二立方米。一日最多給水量。爲四十五萬九千一百六十立方米。一日最少給水量。爲二十七萬九千四百十一立方米。每日每人平均給涾是。約合一百八十六立方尺。統計設施之經費。迄昭和元年度止。爲三千五百五十餘萬元。又復興後速成工事。爲五百十三萬元。按照此後所定水道擴張計劃之完全。合計預算總額。約須六千七百餘萬元云。</p>
<p>（二）下水道設施下水道設施。於市民保健衛生上關係至重。且與上水道之設施。尤有最密切相需爲用之功。自明治四十一年下水道基本改良設計以來。至明治四十四年第一期工事。着手於下谷區淺草區方面。大正五年。因雨水泛濫爲災。延至大正九年。其第二期工事。即進展至京橋。日本橋。鞠町。芝區等。并市之中樞地域。第三期工事。則爲大震災後復興之激進。全市下水道之設施。始燦然大備。統計東京市下水道之系統。約分三區。（一）爲芝區。麻市。赤坂。鞠町。四谷。牛迅。小石川。日本橋。之八區。并本鄕神田。又京橋之大部分。及下谷之一部。（二）爲淺草區之全部。及下谷之大部分神田。又本鄕之。部。（三）爲本所。深川。等區之全部。及京橋之内月島等。以上列舉下水道系統之三區域。各有面積。并各置唧筒場。及處分場焉。記者是日參觀下水道各地事畢。以爲時尚早。爰憶日友宫崎龍介氏。（日社會民衆黨領袖。）曾於己己夏來華參加中山先生奉安大典時識荆。庽東京市外高田町。電車可直達。因偕内田武夫氏。并杜懷榮女士往謁。氏偕白蓮夫人出見。接待殷勤。并荷惠贈民衆自治題字。并近照一幀。當亦書贈民治先河一紙。懷榮女士。亦書日華親善四字。以贈白蓮夫人。海國重逢。故人情重。嗣復郵贈宫崎以半身攝影一幀爲報。并賦贈兩絕云。厚貺頒來兩美俱。丰神清秀字清腴。携歸直等千金寳。加此多情事所無。又欲慰先生渴想衷。聊將小影付郵筒。自知形穢慙交換。留待他年當雪鴻。</p>

<p>山本縣作</p>
<p>陳抱一譯</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>産業的農民美術、現在雖行於歐羅巴各地、但我未詳審其實狀、就斷片的見聞想起來、則在大工業發達的地方例如英國那樣的地方、似乎漸見衰亡、原來、像英國那般、不是農民美術的地方、農村也似乎將要荒廢了的、據農林部的農政課長不平氏的記述、則說英國最近也見有企圖農村工藝復興的運動在開始了、</p>
<p>聞得羅伊特喬治曾說、「農民、最近至於爲農村的家内工業所引動、例如在那衛爾斯的農村各階級中、將製造玩具的方法敎授、着農村」、據說其復興所計畫着的、是製作木製玩具、木彫、鐵片手工皮革手工、製籃、花邊、手織物等</p>
<p>在謀小工業的振興、於支配「所謂分散勞働」上用意的德國、或擁着多數農夫、把野外勤勞包封於可怕的悠長寒冬裏俄羅斯等處、這種農民美術似乎是依然昌盛的、據說、在德國、爲敎育農村民子弟起見、設有種種工藝職業學校、對於獨立的製作者、則在全國大小都市、有官民協辦的手工業會議所等之設置、似乎是特爲着分散孤立的手工業者、促成其團體組織而且援助其發展的一種機關、尤其對於農村工藝、有着有力的贊助團體之後援、在大都市中、設販賣店、開展覽會戰演講會、而盡力於宣傳並奬的、在俄羅斯及意大利等處、於農民美術奬勵時、似乎是使從其本國古來之美術中取法樣式的、但德國則不同、在德國的工藝學校、大抵都是用鼓勵獨創的說話專做標語、例如、敎授白地布加工的、著名的温漢羅伊特的農民學校的標語、就是丨丨「單純丨丨堅牢丨丨大膽」、前述的以手工業者後援爲目的之贊助團體、對製作者聲明着、「吾們希望人民自身能各自發見自己的獨創力、創造的能力、和過去的成功及將來之可能性、對於遵照吾們的趣旨而工作的一切的工匠、吾們當與以實際的努力、並廣告他們的事業」</p>
<p>俄國的農民手工業、於從業者衆多之點、大約可算是世界第一吧在約十七年前的俄國農事管理局報告上、這樣記述着、「俄羅斯的農民手工業、雖則由有無不分明的小單位所成、然而是次於農産的重要生産額」、又說、「俄羅斯的農民」</p>
<p>手工業、是包含着職工業的全總類、」</p>
<p>即由此、大約也可以窺知其普遍的膨大呵、自從變爲勞農俄羅斯之後、農民美術似乎也被想像爲陷於衰運、然亦有傳謂反較帝政時代更加繁榮的、無論孰是孰非、總之、勞農政府之重視農民手工業却是事實、這個證據、只要看農民手工業是直屬於蘇維埃俄羅斯的最高經濟會議、由重要人物爲其領袖、有專門的週刊新聞發行着等情形、也就可明白了、</p>
<p>在俄羅斯、除了自用的及産業的農民美術之外、尚有也可稱爲文化主義的　藝術運動的農民美術的一種丨丨著名的農民美術、這就是以皇女瑪莉亞·推尼歇夫所主持的搭拉秋基諾的工作房爲中心、而拓殖於司莫連思古農村的手工藝、推尼歇夫之對於此事業的思想、似乎是與英國的維廉·廠里斯（註Ｂ）共鳴的一種皇女瑪莉亞·是以摩里斯之對於都市而抱同一的希望來屬意於農村人民的、</p>
<p>就是、她願要以美術工藝·音樂·演劇來使農村民的日常生活豐富、而使他們的情感高尚的、當時、皇女及七個美術家以農村的男女爲弟子、而敎授他們的東西、恐怕不僅是染色、剌繡或木工、木彫等工作的技法、而且必定還有更深奥的藝術之智能、總之、皇女所特别注意的、叫做「司莫連思古的剌繡」的布帛工藝、是具有近代風味凉、質朴而氣品高雅的東西、然而僅發源於二十年前的那流脈、後來又究竟變成了怎樣呵、</p>
<p>（註Ｂ、維廉·摩里斯、乃英國的國案家·詩人·社會主義者、曾設工廠以振興美術工藝的、）</p>
<p>要適切於民俗敎育的本義、且一面與都會趣味相反映而不陷於機械製品的競爭、却與牠對立並行爲必要的丨丨今後之農民美術的目標、是應當置於何處呢、丨丨我回顧自己的經諗、而從司莫連思古布帛工藝受得許多暗示、我見得、自用工藝之絕無或巳全滅了的、現代農村所作的産業的農民美術丨丨之沒有生命一層、乃是不得巳的事情、然而由産業的工用所鍜鍊的技術、也未始不會在什麽時候、、被應用着而産出有生命的農民美術來</p>

<p>所謂感想、與評論何異、不過感想是主觀的、評論是客觀的、但不論主觀或客觀、一切的結論、不能無所根據、爲要聲明我寫感想的理由、自難免像開塲白的故例先說一個片斷、</p>
<p>說也慚愧、我簡直沒有資格辨别人家的藝術、雖然我是個藝壇裏的信徒、但是我從未領敎過高深的藝術的知、識這篇感想的發軔、可以說是自我的理解、而我也有所把握、縱使在藝園裏我並未嘗充分底學習過、却也尚未休止去研究、所以海上一切的藝展、總留着我的足跡、</p>
<p>這回白鵝研究所習作展覽、使我見了覺着深刻的印像、雖然出品不多、却已予我不少的新途徑、每幅的畫圖、有各個的特長、最令我愛慕而佩服的、要算</p>
<p>（一）方雪鴣的「花一般的誘感」、畫着一位赤膊少女、雙眸斜盼着、肩際掛一朶白花寓意旣深、色彩也好、說到神情、更和眞的無二、無論誰、見了也生慕、謂爲花一般的誘惑、的確、</p>
<p>（二）潘思同的「晚泊」、偉壯極了、設色很精緻、繪着無數歸舟、聚泊江上、加以夕陽斜照、紅光綠水、相映富麗益彰、</p>
<p>（三）維天民的「順風」表像逼眞、退後望去、那揚帆的舟子、像乘風勢般底前進、這個美點、是在於前桅微傾前方、若被風力所壓、而後桅却直立不倚、因爲後桅是主要物、比前桅堅固許多、所以不爲風力屈服、理之當然、也就是羅君的獨到處、</p>
<p>（四）陳秋草的「朦朧之夜」、最能表現物質底透澈、而用色却很簡、單所繪暮景、蕭瑟異常在路旁陰翳的叢林内、懸着一輪黯然欲滅的落月荒凉的路途中、一客忙歸趕程、所持燈籠、光色慘淡、這種幽靜凄凉的景况、雖尺幅圖中、抒寫極其盡致、誠是妙手、</p>
<p>以上數幅、繪法確稱上乘、我獨最愛、但佳品尚多如周熙的「燈光」、雪鴣的「凄凉之街」、及秋痕志貞雪鷗的出品、各有特長、均甚美妙、還有</p>
<p>「野外」兩幅、何愛貞畫的比較好一點、因爲江面繚闊、小小畫紙、可以容納無限的景物、不但壯觀且能使觀者隨視綫而心曠、愛貞的畫、就是勝在這一籌、統觀這次白鵝的展會、成績倒也不差、眞的不致辜負了我的時間和企望、</p>
<p>誰都知道落伍的中國藝壇、很難進展了、然而這幾年來、繪畫的提倡極爲熱烈、負責指導的藝園、又是如何底增多、表面上似乎是中國藝壇的好現象、可是眞精神的作者、未見産生有幾位、偉大的出品、也少能看到、這大槪因爲藝園裏的學者、不重視藝術的價值、也許爲了藝園裏的畢業時間是預先規定、致使學者得不到時間上充分的基礎研究、所以難將作品使鑑賞者表同情、還有許多謬誤的原子、我不想詳細底再說下去、因爲這篇文的内容、祗是爲白鵝發感、所以寫到這裏、便暫算個結束、俟有機會時、另爲文來討論、</p>

<h3 id="c197">現代作家文質 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>王墳著</p>
<p>眞美善出版</p>
<p>「現代作家」包含十個短篇、「在山後」、「遁逃」、「兩行列」、「一個老者」、「誘惑」、「現代作家」、「年初四夜」、「雪的堆積中」、「雨的山前」、「上墳」、這裏每篇有不同的人型、在這不同的人型中、作者很細緻地把牠表現出來、的確、在現時代中、無論如何、這些人物、都可以找到的、在我們日常的生活裏、這些人物、也都可以見到、然而在常人眼裏、便每輕易放過、作者却牢牢找住、不放鬆一點、譬如「一個老者」、如果我們出門、這樣的老者很容易見到、「窗口閃過一列車、這列車子纔移動、老者往後一傾、駡車子、駡司機的人、以至駡到當今的路政、然而話中又說到黨國要人、聞者色變、」（三十四頁）中國人最喜歡駡人家的、可是自己又沒有意識、以至弄得「說不清、道不明」了、而且慣樂善其身、自已自私、反責人家自私、明知矛盾、終不肯認輸、其次更喜妄談、恭維上者、壓迫下者、老者竟說、「我早料到兩位是學生、多規矩、眞的、如今的局面祗有學生、好他們讀書、讀書讀來幹大衆的事、多愛國、要是他們不游街、不演講、我們怕也不會知道有國恥、有國慶、呵、學生總之看得出、」（三十六頁）這或許是古來尊重仕子之風尚、因爲「車一停、老者讓湧在門口的學生們走了然後自己搶先走、」試問、這樣湧現在我們腦中的老者是怎樣一個印象、</p>
<p>本來創作的題材、也不須要如何異想天開、在民衆的隊伍裏、尋摘生活片斷、用藝術的手腕表達出來、在這時期的確需要、因爲作者受鄕村生活的薰染、他的描寫都趨重於鄕村和下層社會、他不喜軋時髦、所以他也不喜描青春的羅曼史、</p>
<p>「現代作家」十篇作品、都有特緻的風格、作者描寫的手腕非常經濟、像無賴開棺盜屍衣、這故事我從小就聽人講了、現在作者側重於心理的描寫、歷歷跳躍在紙上、這比聽着更增加無限恐怖、又如禁烟的事情、「在其位謀其政」的醜史已數見不鮮、眞是「老實說、」烟是那裏禁得盡、如今、我倆在這裏、豈非也犯了法、」那末、貪官污吏永打倒不盡的、又如作者描舄小脚嬸嬸孀居而失、身這象徴現代女子的危險、一旦受誘惑便變心了、「乳峯正和來時一樣高、祇是肚皮有些異樣了、」又如白梗芋趕睹、却被捉賭者捉住了、爲的髮辮給揪住、因而惱起「今夜全是爲了這條辮」拿剪刀剪掉了、描寫得眞非常深刻、</p>
<p>作者描寫小孩子的天眞、旣可愛、又可笑、也可憐、「三狗很歡喜、因爲明天的菜、到底是自己吃、他明知爺是不會吃了、在他想想、肉、紅燒肉、菜燒肉、燒得要紅、多放糖、湯是發紫了、纔有味、魚是青菜燒的魚有小骨頭、要梗、不好吃、肉絲、肉絲也好、金花菜、明天是不會動筷的想着、喉頭一骨碌、嚥了一口沬」（一百三十四頁）不道把鳶子放上人有屋頂便失去一頓豐腴的上墳菜、</p>
<p>作者是學生、自然不免對於學校生活方面有所感觸了、「以「現代作家」名這集了、爲的是這一篇中所描寫的、是在我以往十八年的歷程中、從未觀察到的一種人生方式、而這事的遭遇印入我的心靈最深、」（第五頁）可知作者印象之深刻、所以寫來也特别賣力了、這是寫一個大學生出版一本新文藝書的驕氣、後來給社員查出那幀封面是社裏的東西、於是向他責問、結果他退出第三天另發起春風社、像平先生的人物在現代的大學生中觸目皆是、其實就是沒有集團生活的修養、祗知自私、作者在這本集子裏、諷剌的情調是很濃厚的、唯其如此、愈有力地襯托了起來、</p>
<p>我最喜歡「雨的山前」和「上墳」二篇、無論結搆之類都較其他幾篇好、其次「現代作家」和「在山後、」了、不過作者在集子裏似乎有一種缺點便是消沉、苦悶、悲觀、傷感的氣雰太濃烈、雖然我不是絕對要求慷慨的氣槪、和激昻的基調但是總以爲我們當注以有力的、有希望的、有光明的、有意志的、有精神的血清、對於社會、有相當的啓示、不能像毒蜂的剌那樣剌的不關痛癢、我們找住了癥結、便要來克服、那末作者是「戰士」、我們待諸第二集的問世吧、</p>
<h3 id="c198">女人讀餘 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>凌叔華著短篇小說集</p>
<p>像小雀兒那樣活躍的思念、出入洞的蛇那樣靈活的筆法、那是批評叔華女士最洽當的說法、雖然她的思想不十分開展、到人生的全部去、祇能用她描摹得繪聲繪色的女人對於傭工之批判、女學生的生活、以及一切的都能給讀者深刻的印象、</p>
<p>我們都知道作者是一個「女人」、所以她於女人之心理、能夠特别的深切一點去描寫、雖然有的人會說她過於誇耀、但是我相信這是可能的你不相信「病」中的玉如嗎、她這一種人是有的、如果現在還不信我的話、那末我可把玉如的事蹟簡略的錄下來、讓大家看看丨</p>
<p>玉如的丈夫芷青病了、她勸他到西山去養病、但爲了沒錢、就不能去了玉如不安心愛夫這樣再下去、不去養病、就四出借錢、可是結果都碰壁了、她一面詛咒世熊之冷酷、一面就自己去畫畫賣錢、和愛夫一起去養病、當畫畫時受盡了愛夫之猜疑、丈夫竟會動了離異之心、後來也終就大家都明白了、</p>
<p>這裏、我可說那女人是值得贊揚、同時也在可能中世界上有這樣女人的、就是那男人丨芷青的猜疑、也不過是種普遍的妒嫉而已、我說這篇小說中人物是很普通的所貴者、作者能把件事情描寫得這樣精采、一點不使人會覺得這是一件平常的事、</p>
<p>以上是關於「病」一篇技巧與搆局一項而言、如說其内容、則是件重大的社會問題啊、</p>
<p>丨人是應該工作的、但爲了「病」、是否應當休息、假使理應休息、却沒有錢怎樣的解决呢、這就成了社會上的問題了、至於玉如假造人家的畫幅、用騙子般的手段去叫人家上當、那對道德上不免有了缺憾雖然芷青責她的時候她講丨</p>
<p>「我不管了、管不了了、」那樣令人辛酸的話、如以「情」講、是「情有可願」處、但如以理問、就是不道德了、我們能否可客納這種人在世上呢、就成了一個很大的不易解决的問題了、</p>
<p>的確、這還不過是叔華女士作品中之一例、餘多的也往往具有這種特點、就是將社會的矛盾、不良、統統都安放在作品中、試將這本集了細細地分析開來介紹、我們就能得到更多一點了、</p>
<p>在小劉一文中、小劉從前要取笑人家有孩子的婦人的、當小劉讀書時代、有一個婦人和她同級、於是她就召集同志、想去告校長、不許那婦人來讀書、後來想還是直接去取笑那婦人好、於是就在上縫紉課時、任意的說笑婦人、結果那婦人跑了、在這說笑的時候、那點和小劉同黨的那種頑皮的態度、作者那枝像出了洞的蛇那樣靈活的筆、把牠活現出來了、</p>
<p>小劉後來經過這期學生時代以後、</p>
<p>終於自己也生起孩子來了、這樣矛盾的事實、和抱獨身主義者嫁娶同一樣的易見在青年叢中、我說過、作者慣於寫平常的事、而筆却不凡、那才是「好」呵、</p>
<p>「李先生」一篇比較次一點、主旨不見顯明、但是主角李先生那種冷靜的態度、依舊還能給讀者一點印像、至於她做學監時說、</p>
<p>「每逢星期日、」一堆信内、情書大約佔多數、「也難怪、這點孩子也是到了愛寫情書的時候了、」···</p>
<p>把學校生活中常見的事情、清描淡寫的深印紙上而跑入讀者的腦中去了、</p>
<p>是哪、這是學校中常見的事情、</p>
<p>「送車」那篇、主旨是一件帶有滑稽性的事情、（就是作者在别的幾篇中、往往也喜用滑稽的事實的、）但在暗中却充分的表揚出一個專愛批判傭人的壞處的婦人、譬如丨</p>
<p>「王小姐、你還沒管過家、那知道底下人的壞處、唉、簡直沒有一個老實的、那天我叫他買一隻鷄回來、我拿秤秤過明明是一斤四稍微高一些、</p>
<p>他却報一斤五了、豆芽菜十四個銅子一斤、前幾天我問過的他說人家非十五個銅子不賣···」</p>
<p>那一類說傭人壞處的話、眞統篇全是、怪不得他的丈夫要止住她說丨</p>
<p>「你換個題目講好不好、總講他們、不嫌膩嗎、」</p>
<p>是的、太膩了、眞像青年學生們之愛談異性也一樣自己不會覺得膩的、</p>
<p>閒話多說了、我就再說了一篇「女人」就停嘴吧、</p>
<p>「女人」的佈局太使人愛了、滑稽緊凑、處處表出作者剪裁的苦心、更處處顯示作者的天眞、「女人」全篇中那個二實很引人注意、可愛、將來的中國的主人翁、我們樂觀些等着好了、女主角那種柔和的手段、使他們二人分離、我說旣有味、也極有効騐、看本篇不是一個實證嗎朋友、你如遇到這樣的事情、請你也這樣試試罷、</p>
<p>這篇文筆也很好很能使人滿意、叔華把牠當書名就是爲了這個原故吧、、</p>

<h3 id="c201">汽車用之第塞爾引擎沛甘 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>功效卓著且甚經濟</p>
<p>去歲。自動機械工業界中之一大進步。厥爲採取第塞爾（ＤＩＥＳＥＬ）内部壓縮引擎於汽車及飛機上。汽車上所用之第塞爾引擎。現在尚未離開試騐時期。惟飛機之中則大顯成功。尤其爲燃用低級油料所發出之效率。第一具之第塞爾引擎。係一八九七年德人羅道而夫第塞爾氏所發明。粗製作劣。且奇重。不適於實際用途。其後漸次改良。將機身及重量均加改兩。馴至爲汽船所採用。其經濟之處殊非其他引擎所可望其頂背。凡海行之巨舟更爲適用。第塞爾引擎於一九一九年前。尚未爲美人所注意。而是年乃大爲各種機師所稱道。且認識其實力。西部各油礦開採及運輸油質。自油井至提練之塲。在巨城及四鄰者。必須用一動力機。發動巨大之力。而其費用則求其節省。</p>
<p>凡油礦區所用之發動力機。重量若何。不受影響。故油田之地。採用第塞爾引擎者。比比皆是。今日産油之區。凡各種式樣不動之第塞爾引擎。在在可見。使用之時平稳而收效極大。此種式樣之引擎百用不敝。無論日夜。快行慢走均可勝任。大西洋太平洋沿岸各地。及全世界各海口。自一九一九年來。拖船運輸及漁舟打撈之業大盛。第塞爾引擎因之亦受大用。於是自動機械工程師深知此項引擎之將爲汽車及飛機所採用。爲時不遠。且較任何用途爲巨。但汽車之中而用重一千一百磅之引擎。其事殆非常人所能想像。其欲駕之而行每小時五十英里者。人亦何信。至於有二千三百萬之汽船裝此引擎而行駛於海中者。豈非成爲笑話耶。因之一九一九年前。自動機械工程師之視第塞爾引擎。甚爲淡漠。</p>
<p>史伯萊博士於美國所發明之第一具第塞爾引擎。每匹馬力重二十二磅。其效率之大自無疑義。但欲求於自動機車上用之。相去遠矣。史博士去年又造一第塞爾引擎。每匹馬力减重至三磅。此外重一磅半者亦在試騐之中。此種最新之式樣及其濌理在自動機械工程師視之。以爲可以施之實用。且有價值。</p>
<p>又有台勃爾博士者。爲美國研究第塞爾引擎者巨擘之一。造就一機。以壓縮爲主旨。每匹馬力重二磅又半。目下美國有四十家公司。試騐此第塞爾引擎。以爲汽車之用。數月前有德國發明家勃去門氏者。以發明第塞爾引擎注油之電解産生氣體法。而得專賣之權。此法之主旨在油缸受壓縮之時。緩和其四壁拉緊之力。在歐洲瞭解此特許之價值者。較之美洲爲甚。蓋歐洲者常爲自動機物之巨大試騐場也。</p>
<p>談及第塞爾引擎之基本用。殊稱簡單。注射燃料油之汽缸中。抽入空氣。空氣受壓縮而發熱。結果則油質自行燃燒。欲求最大之效力則汽缸四壁之有巨拉緊力乃意中之事。因之製造此機所需金屬。其必須有極大之抵抗力。爲事甚顯。然一方面則亦不能過重。否則經營上之經濟將盡爲能力所壓制也。近數年中製第塞爾引擎者。咸取鑄鐵爲料。近有一種鉛質之混合物。發明於汽車界中。堅牢之力極大。且質亦輕。汽車機師現巳以鉛質製第塞引擎。據稱成績甚佳。至於飛機之上。更無問題。數年之中。將盡用鉛製者也。</p>
<p>苟汽車中改變用第塞爾引擎者。較之現行之汽油引擎。其費用祇及五分之一耳。弗須用火星塞子。管理上平稳而簡使。凡不完全之燃燒及調節諸項危險均可免除。因每一汽缸均自動裝置及調節也。數年前有發明二炭矯基汽油者。利用汽缸中每一活塞之運動力。此項燃料較普通之汽油。費用爲大。縱甚有效而非爲駕駛者所喜用。若用第塞爾引擎。則結果相同。而其鄪用即較之普通汽油亦尚低廉也。</p>
<p>第塞爾引擎之汽缸每一動作後。自能清掃。因受縮壓空氣之力爲效甚大。下級油料可以應用。機製必以金屬物。始可維持拉緊之力。此爲全世界汽車機師所研究之問題。近來汽車之售價日就低廉。飛機之爲用又日益廣大。自動機械工程師日求經濟有效之力。以期有大量之産額。若近數年來第塞爾引擎之爲用巳甚廣泛。較之一八九七年羅道而夫第塞爾發明此機時。巳不可同日而語矣。</p>

<p>麥門八缸汽車之優著成績。爲世所稀。究其根源。實因機師與工人富有機械學識與經騐。故其製造精細。工作認眞。麥門各式八缸車出品。均極精美。無不稱滿。</p>
<p>在近四年中。麥門車廠人員。均專心於大人汽缸車協力同心。研究改良。成績大著。自一九二六年後。即良變方針。棄舊換新。今除製造大人缸汽車外。别無他種。全廠人員之工作專一。不致分心。麥門機師與工人。可謂製造大人汽缸車之專家矣。</p>
<p>麥門機械部之各人腦筋。均已八缸化。初次製造時。並非冐昧從事。實已早有籌備。先期試騐。故在此四年中。爲期雖極短促。然其成績頗爲可觀。今之最大目標在使該項大人缸車爲一動作妙極與經濟耐用之汽車。</p>
<p>今麥門廠全體職員。自工友以至各部主任均巳一律專心於大八汽缸車之設計與建築事務。昔視八缸車爲難事。今則不以謂然。八缸車之製法與組織。視若常事。毫無困難矣。</p>
<p>麥門汽車特色頗多。如調音機。雙用低落出汽管等。工人製配之時。不但知其物而明其理。此種智識學術。决非一朝一夕所能得。乃積四年工作之經騐。始有今日之成功。</p>
<p>麥門經理與推銷員。均知大八汽缸之優點。式樣精仔。動作數捷。即車主與顧客亦莫不知恐八汽缸車日益盛行。頗加注意。八缸車中。麥門可謂佼佼者。誠不愧爲八汽缸車之統領。欲知八汽缸之詳情。可向麥門汽車製造廠詢問。必能圓滿答覆也。</p>
<p>第一輛麥門大八缸汽車最初告成。時在一九二六年。四年之間。巳將八缸各式汽車。七十九號之八缸車。六十九號之八缸車及麥門羅司福汽車。售價公道。自美金一千元起至二三千元不等。貨眞價實。廉美無比。</p>
<h3 id="c203">上半年上海汽車肇禍統計 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>共計五三八一起</p>
<p>超過歷年之紀錄</p>
<p>汽車如市虎。其能殺人肇祋也。雖三尺孺子。殆亦莫不知之。上海爲亞洲第一大商埠。自汽車事業風盛以來。市内所有車輛。亦冠於遠東各地。車輛一多。則肇禍亦易。此爲必然之事也。我人祗須一閱報紙。則汽車傷人肇禍之事。殆無日無之。頃據上海工部局之統計。謂本年上半年六個月中。租界之上。所有汽車傷人肇禍之案件。竟超過歷年之統計。造成從來未有之新紀錄。所傷人數。多至數百。而金錢上之損失。尤屬不堪估計矣。此種不良之現象。爲當局者。自當力謀補救之方法。是故工部局方面。已三令五申。竭力促</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>行人之注意。而一方對於駕車之人。亦時加警告。以冀肇禍案件之减少。</p>
<p>自正月一日。至六月三十日。前後六個月中。上海公共租界境内。汽車肇禍之案件。共計有五千三百八十一起。其中受傷身死者六十三人。受傷未死者一千九百六十七人。然在此一千九百六十七人之中。亦有多人。傷毁之處。無法使其復原。將終身成一廢疾之人者。故金錢上之損失。實屬巳不堪數計矣。六月之中。行人之爲汽車碾及。當即斃命者。計有九人。内中有行人六名。當其行步之時。自不小心。意欲穿過馬多。因而爲汽車所撞。如以本年上半年六個月中。所有汽車肇禍案件。與去年作一比較。則一九二九年上半年僅有四千六百四十二起。其間相差之多。亦不言而可知矣。</p>
<p>一九二九年全年所有之汽車肇禍案件。凡九千六百九十一起。以今年上半年之情形而言。設下半年工部局所採免除肇禍之方法。全無效果。則本年肇禍案件。將超過往年多多。可斷言也。本年六月之中。肇禍案件。凡九百三十九起。其中受傷之人數計有三百四十九人。三月份之報告。則爲九百八十二起。較六月份更多。六月份所有之肇禍案件。自由車一百三十二起。其中由乘車之人。不愼而肇禍者七十起。汽車所肇之禍。計七百十起。受傷之人數。凡二百十二人。自由車所傷者有五十人。電車所肇之禍。傷人十六名。而公共汽車肇禍案件。亦有一百起之多。其中受傷者七十人。此外其他交通器具。包括人力車。共傷五十八人。</p>
<p>在各處所發生之肇禍案件。據巡捕之調查報告。則六月之中。所有案件。受傷之人。因有不小心而被汽車衝撞者凡一百五十三人。南京路爲車馬集中之地。六月中肇禍案件。仍佔多數。被撞之後。當即斃命計有二人。其次爲四川路。碾斃一人。新閘橋附近斃一人。浙江路二人。楊樹浦路一人。當此夏日。黄昏時節。途中汽車較平時爲多。蓋皆兜風者也。且華人習慣。一車之中。所坐乘客過多。而此種車輛。大都由車行租來。開車之人。不甚老練。其行駛於途中也。速率或超過限止以上。而頻頻鳴以喇叭。以致其他車輛。駕車之人。亦幾爲若輩所亂。於是肇禍亦因而更易矣。此種駕車之人。現在巡捕方法。巳加以注意。一方並促行人步行之時。加以警惕。庶可免於禍患。在狹小之馬路上。駕車之人。越前車而過。亦在禁止之例。速率不得過快。駛車之時。須各走一邊。不准混亂。以冀禍患之免除。而不傷一人一物也。</p>
<h3 id="c204">柴油汽車丁祖澤 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>現代汽車之燃料。一般爲汽油。故多有名之曰汽油汽車。汽油之價值。在燃料油中比較爲貴價品。雖在出産國或非産地之使用汽車者。仍能得一經濟的運輸。然汽油之産量將有日漸稀少之現象。與更欲求再經濟的新燃料。實爲工商界每日所思慮及者。數年前曾有人提倡採用酒精與柴油爲汽油之代用品。酒精之試騐並得有相當之成績。但其價值仍未見十分便宜。至於柴油一物確係液體燃料中最廉品。並已經爲陸用定置發動機與船舶發動機採作燃料。且顯呈極合宜極經濟之結果。其不克作汽車發動機之燃料之用難。爲機體太笨重及運轉不敏銳。現今德國摩西特司朋士汽車廠MERCEDESBEOZ）巳打破上述之困難問題。剏製柴油載客汽車與運貨汽車。而在專界製造汽車最多之美國。仍未聞有正式出品。蓋美轼因有價廉之汽油供給也。</p>
<p>最近美國克朋司柴油引擎公司。以其所製之船舶用柴油發動機一具。裝配於一九二五年式之汽車底盤上。以試騐柴油發動機是否能代替汽油發動機。並覩其有何差異。該汽車裝配成全後。自哥侖白司起行。經印地那。地德羅。而抵紐約。復由紐約而返抵原出發地。竟有極滿意之結果。</p>
<p>此試駛行程。計共二千七百八十英里。途中經過平地山地各式道路。最高速率達每小時五十五英里。行駛之稳妥。與汽油汽車幾無分别。以柴油在美國僅售八分至一角一介侖。（約合華幣二角五分至三角。）乃大爲工程界所驚奇。</p>
<p>此次所用之柴油發動機爲四汽缸式。汽缸内徑爲四英寸半。衝程爲六英寸。馬力五十匹。所用之汽車。並非特爲製造。係以舊式汽車（一九二五年式。）拆去原來之汽油發動機。而將一舶用柴油發動機一个。截去其笨重之擱脚。裝入之。該汽車上其他部分。並無改換。</p>
<p>此柴油汽車。係由克明司柴油引擎公司經理克明司君親自駕駛。其行駛之稳捷。與平常汽車無異。當下午四時至五時。行駛於紐約最繁盛之區域。絕無困難遇到。亦未爲路人所留意。蓋此汽車之外表。一無特别形態。又無特别聲息。除在車後所懸之車胎套上。標寫一行「克明司公司柴油試騐汽車」小字外。無他表幟也。</p>
<p>當此次試騐之前。該公司初未有何預備。出發之日。自早晨九時三十分起。將該汽車處理僅一小時零五分。即行就道。直至行程終了。共行二十五小時。二千七百八十英里。用柴油一百零二介侖。以每介侖七分美金計算。計共費燃料七元餘美金。基以同一式樣之汽油汽車。行駛同一行程。則需汽油八十六元之美金。由此可證明柴油汽車之簡省。其消費僅及汽油汽車十二分之一。且該汽車之重量計六千磅約比汽油汽車重一倍。</p>
<p>據克明司君對人稱。彼此次試騐。不過欲證明舶用或平常移動用之柴油發動機。</p>
<p>亦可用之於汽車耳。蓋彼嘗聞人道及柴油發動機之拙笨以之驅動汽車。殊不合宜之語。特親自試騐之。以證流言之不足信。復信初次試騐之成功。若以柴油發動機裝配於運貨車。農用車。或公共汽車一類之重車上。最爲相宜。即裝配於普通客車亦無不可云。</p>

<p>今年汽車界將有大變動美國統計學專家巴勒斯哥近於紐約西方大學俱樂部討論會中。討論「一九三○年之汽車事業」云。本年美國汽車事業。將有極劇烈之變化。其故蓋各較小公司。必將爲二三大公司所吞併也。巴勒斯哥之意見。以爲根據統計。兩大公司之出品。占全部之百分之六十五。而此百分之六十五。又復占全部低價車之百分之八十。似此情形。較小公司。萬難與資本雄厚之大公司競爭。結果。勢必至爲其併吞而後已。君如不信。試觀三四年後。美國屆時必僅存有三四大公司。其出品當可代表全美。尤有進者。銀行界年來屢表示金融不若昔日之健全。故今年趨勢。低價車之銷路。必較高價車爲旺。大公司以資本充足。每個成本。極爲低微。故易得社會人士之歡心。小公司能力不逮。即勉且低其價格。然大公司苟與之爲難。故意使車價降低。小公司必損失不貲。而營業難於維持矣。此種現象。日漸顯著。事實上情形如此。無可爲諱也。至今之汽車銷路。可達三·五○○·○○○輛之數。難望再高云云。細味其言。頗含至理也。</p>
<p>奥佛蘭五百萬里試車韋廉斯奥佛蘭公司。爲宣傳並試騐其新出韋廉斯六缸車起見。將舉行五·○○○·○○○里之試駛。其試車中之重要者。厥爲登山。速度。馬力等等。汽車家皆可參加。如試登山。則須先揀定一山路。以騐其動力。如欲試騐是否每小時可行四十八英里。則可於坦道中試駛。公司預測參加試車者。將有數千人。故結東一星期間。五百萬里之試騐。可以達到。成績如何。不難判明云。</p>
<p>汽車競賽章程更變美國汽車協會汽車競賽部。近頒新規章。規定每次競賽。</p>
<p>以一○○里爲限。每里奬金五十元。故百里當爲五○○○元。所行之路途。亦經規定。俾資劃一。而利進行云。</p>
<p>今年汽車出産額之預測美國國家商務調查會主席巴茵氏今日語人云。本年度美國之汽車出産額。可達四·六○○·○○○輛。此蓋包括客貨車而言者。就今年三數月來之觀察。一九三零年之氣象。正復不弱。二月份之出産。超過去年同時甚多。各項機件之銷路均極佳。銀行市塲。頗覺鞏固。故有謂今年不及去年者。鄙人實未敢贊同也</p>
<p>汽車裝無線電將實施汽車中裝無線電頗轟傳一時。蓋便利社會。其功至偉。本年度無綫電製造業董事會開會。巳决定實施大規模裝置之辦法。照預定計劃。董事會將發表告民衆書。言汽車中裝無綫電之利益。對谥世人反對裝置者加以詳盡之解釋。主其事者。一爲梅特加夫。一爲柯爾勃。皆此中健將。惟政府方面。尚待疏通。蓋美政府因汽車裝無綫電後。結果流弊甚多。而紊亂公安。車輛肇禍。尤爲不可免之事實故刻尚未表示同意。至發明汽車無線電者。係二波斯頓人。一名好斯門。一名惠刻斯勒。皆爲自動無線電廠職員。此時彼輩因政府不允許。已另發明一種機件。惟在車停時可以通話。車行時即失效用。如此則乘客不致於車中高談。而在車輛損壞時。則可呼援。似此折衷辦法。可以兩全。近此件巳呈政府試騐。未知當局諸公。於意云何也。</p>

<p>發動機何故衝撞</p>
<p>換言之。約百分之二十五的熱力變爲有工作。其餘則經由冷水。從發動機各部通過廢汽管而散入空氣。</p>
<p>即使工程師的智慧。能夠克制若干浪費。然膨漲終不免受限制。因在未著火以前。混合汽之壓縮有一定不易之限度。且因原動機的上行衝程與下行動程相等。故膨漲又爲我人所能實施的壓縮所限制。混合汽旣著火。一方面固欲其膨漲有力。一方面又谷其膨漲平均。若膨漲過分有力。原動機行動急暴而不安稳。將必擊撞衝宿。失却原力。受燒過度。而汽車在山上行動大壞。更有甚者。此種狀態。若聽其長存不息。火星塞與活門將受損壞。軸承亦然。結果汽車修理店可因之大發其財矣。</p>
<p>故制止衝撞爲現行好汽油之一個要素。我且不談專門家的話。我可說此項特質之造成實由考騐混合汽在汽缸中燃燒的速度揀選最適宜之原料以實行約束燃燒之速度。然後處理之。混合之。務使所成之汽油含有極高止撞性質。而足能經受最烈之壓縮。</p>

<p>汽油的第二項要素。當然是開車的便利。是固人人知之者。因最足令人懊惱者。莫如車之執滯不易行也。汽車執滯不行。於蓄電池有害於人的性情有害。更有甚者於發動機亦且有害。因開車屢試不能成功。則過量的原生汽油吸入汽缸。滌去汽缸壁上之保護潤滑質。馴至損壞原動機。凡大汽油公司對於開車特質。無不極加注意。汽油之比重要重量。與其揮發性及易於開車無關。現今固已周知各界。蓋須加注意者在其混合體也。</p>

<p>每一種手續的小心謹愼。機械與設備之無限。煞費苦心的無數研究與試騐。眞令我一見驚詫。設非我之領導者告我以一毫之錯。影響極大。我幾不解其何故對此常人視爲普通之物。費却如許金錢與人力也。</p>
<p>以我實騐汽車家的眼光當之。最堪注意者。爲發動機試騐室。室中盡是用以改良汽車之種種機械的怪物。我在其中發見一動人嘆賞的新發明。是即所謂變動壓縮發動機。其壓縮力在機開動時。可隨意變動之測量之。</p>
<h3 id="c210">機械的怪物 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>有此發動機。裝有各種機具足以核騐其動作後。各大汽油公司試騐各種汽油。不但能决定其止撞性質。並能决定其動力效能與其特質。是各公司一方面製定標準。一方面又說求進步。故意的打倒之也</p>
<p>我在彀　汽油棧房中。又見一可異的發動機。汽缸頂上開出一扇透明的水晶窗。由此不但可能見能爆發的火燄。且能測量行駛的速度。此項方法。對於汽油之止撞特質頗有關係。我固已說明於前矣。</p>
<p>許多發動機每分鐘爆發達二千次以上。由窗中窺之謂能得甚確切之眞像殊不可信。然吾人竂其試騐之成績確屬有效無疑。</p>
<p>我在彼所見各種發動機及其他機械甚夥。要皆專俱改良汽車之用。惜限於篇幅。又限於能力。不能盡情描述。雖然我對於小馬立斯發動機之實騐開車之便利。其實騐工作近乎令人心碎膽寒。我不能不致一詞以頌揚之也。</p>
<p>發動機設置於一間特别室内。一日。室之四周。繞以散熱機。全室温度。遂若冰天雪地之北冰洋。次日。則改用他法。將此室變爲熱帶氣候。小馬立斯在此極寒極熱的環境之中。行動自如。狀頗快樂。</p>
<p>我常喜專用一種牌號的汽油。據我最近經騐。此在今日實爲必要。吾願以此法介紹於讀者。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c211">漢口市街路植樹計劃悟非 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>漢口一市。就其地勢言。宜於造林之地實鮮。然如市街地及湖畔堤側等處。皆宜栽植樹木。以增風致。至於維護公共衛生。利用樹木之主副産物。猶在其次。兹將造林計劃中之關於街路植樹者言之。撮其大要。約分三端。即一對於現有行道樹之整理。二本年度行道樹之新植補植。三對於以後行道樹之栽植計劃是也。</p>
<p>現又有行送樹之整理漢市之有行送樹。始於租界及各特區。迄後華界亦效法栽植。惟分街警保護不力。輒被摧殘。枯死老衰。疎零不整。且同一街路。前後栽植。樹種大小。各有不同。參差不齊。故於觀瞻有礙。現由市府擬具應行整理事項四條。以爲補救。（一）現有行送樹之枯死及老衰者槪行撤去。另以與現值樹木同種同大者補植之。（二）栽植過密者。酌行疎捶使其株距漸趨一致。掘起之樹補植他愛。（三）同一街路混增二種以上形態不同之樹柱時。則撤去其生長較劣者。而以惠生長較良樹植回種回大之樹柱之。同一街路如有較種年齡之樹木時。則用整姿法。折制年齡大者之生長。使其形狀大小漸專年齡小者躋極致。凡此四者。爲對於現有行過樹整理之計劃也。</p>
<p>本年度之栽植行道樹爲增美市容維護衛生起見。特於新築沿江馬路及中正路栽植行道樹。其樹種沿江馬路用法國梧桐剌柏棕櫚。中正路用大葉柳。各街路之已植行道樹者。因迭受外界推殘。枯死甚多。並擬一槪補植。以壯觀瞻。其樹種則擇與各街路現植樹木同種同大者。樹種則爲梧桐洋槐梓械黄金樹白楊大葉柳等供行道樹用之樹木以樹高一丈以上胸高直徑一寸以上。枝葉豐茂。軀幹勁直者爲宜。其新植之樹。（一）在沿江馬路方面。於步道一例設幅一公尺之植樹地帶。行距家屋約四公尺半。行道樹其他一律植草地内。距車道一公尺。每隔八公尺栽植一株。兩側併植約需百二十四株。惟當街衢之交叉點及里巷出入口則不栽植。（二）在中正路方面。每七公尺植樹一株。兩側併植約需三百株。該路人行道甚狹。不敷載植。擬於車道兩側掘穴。距人字溝約○。七五公尺。街衢之交叉點。則得交叉點六咸七公尺處開始栽種。其補植之樹。各街路應補株數共計一五六四株。補植樹木之株距及距家屋距離者。均依照巳植樹木之原定距離以示劃一。各街路行道樹之栽植過密者酌行疎掘。即以掘取之樹補植他處。在府東一路之行道樹。因邊綫過狹。不便設置支柱。兹定邊綫展寛各一公尺。以免妨礙樹木生高而便設</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>置支柱。故在本年度應行新柱或袖植之苗木費挖取費包裝費·運費。栽植費。設置支柱費·雜費·總計爲二五五○·八七四元云。</p>
<p>以後行道樹之栽植計劃行道樹之樹植。須具備以下四條件。（一）樹木之形狀色澤。以能發揮自然美。增市街美觀者。（二）有樹蔭可遮夏日陽光而又不妨害道路乾燥者。（三）適於木地風土者。（四）生長迅速這應力大者。大抵供給行道樹之樹種甚多。在洋槐梧桐白楊梓大葉柳各青法國梧桐中。要以法國梧桐大葉柳洋槐生長最易。故此次亦照定上述數種爲行道樹。其配置方法。凡街幅十五公尺以上。均行載植行迫樹。共約十萬○九千七百公尺。合計約植三二○二○株。惟上新株數内。已行載植者約有六千零八十一株。故除此數。此路應植二九三九株。依此株數。年年客應載植若干。若干年後可完成此數。則視街路修築計划爲轉移。不能預定。兹爲計算便利計。完成期間。定爲十年。則每年應植二千六百株左右。又每年補植及更新株數。以全數十分之一計。則第一年三二○株。第二年三四六○株。第三年三七二○株。第四年三九八四株。第五年四二四○株。第六年四五○○株。第七年四七六○株。第八年五○二○株。第九年五三八○株。第十年五五四○株。共四三七○○株。以後逐年補植及更易三二○○株。至其經費預算。依工務局之植樹經騐。合掘樹包裝運費挖穴栽植及新置支柱等費計之。每植樹一株。約需洋一元。依前十年所列。則逐年栽植。所需經費。爲四三七○○元云。</p>

<p>每小時疾駛一百哩</p>
<p>奪得麥氏大銀杯</p>
<p>空前未有之紀錄</p>
<p>北方嚴寒。盛行溜冰。此種游戲。巳不十分適時。新式滑冰運動。現皆改用汽車跑冰競賽。坎拿大賽特尼之奴佛施高脫城每年必有跑冰比賽之舉。今年麥克愛特大銀杯之優勝者。仍爲跑冰家迪克羅及氏所得。</p>
<p>港面每冬積冰盈尺。堅而平滑。天然跑道。比賽時令。城鄕仕女。莫不爭先恐後。羣往參觀。山陰道上。來往不絕。該地爲世界最著名之快道。每次比賽之成績。常打破全球之紀錄。</p>
<p>今年羅及氏駕駛一新别克跑車。加入競賽。開空前未有之紀錄。跑徑爲一鹽水河面。由愛特華出發至賽特尼止。疾駛而去。速度平均每小時一百零五哩又八十八分。即每一分半鐘可行二哩半。最快時。每小時可增至一百十餘哩之多。</p>
<p>結果首抵終點者爲駕駛别克之羅及氏。與第二跑車相距約一哩之四分之三。速率之快。實爲從來所未有。觀衆莫不驚奇。聞羅及氏共得錦標四次。尤以此次爲最榮。每次比賽均用别克跑車。必操左劵。今人咸稱羅氏爲冰中之王。</p>
<p>羅及氏之别克車箱前加一楔形避風器。以减風勢之抵抗力。並將其齒輪比率更改。以合最高速力。故此别克之引擎。係特别裝配。與普通機器不同也。</p>
<p>麥克愛特銀杯賽爲坎拿大體育事蹟中最有記述價值之一節。每次往觀者。人山人海。熱烈異常。當比賽時。必有警備隊嚴加保護。以防羣衆擠入跑道。而免發生危險。賽員各有組派擁護。結隊呼唱。以事鼓勵。其狂熱情形。未能盡述。塲内至有藉此賭注者。數額不等。輸贏甚大也。今年比賽時。有一二賽員妒忌羅及氏之本領。與少數遲到者。要求復賽。羅及氏均慨然應之。結果終得第一。可見别克車之有功於優勝者。决非尋常之車輛所能比擬也。</p>
<p>競賽之日。積冰甚盛。加以風勢順利。故各車之速度較快。戈登伊兒門氏駕駛一輕快之雪佛蘭跑車。每小時之速度。亦可至八十哩。卒得第四位。</p>
<p>此次各車之速度。實爲觀衆所驚奇不止。至在如此迅疾速率之下而能控制平滑之冰面。爲人人所不能解。經詳細檢察後。始知各車之氣胎内。均裝有闊頭矮針。車輪轉動時。釘尖不時伸縮。速度雖加至極點。亦無顚翻之慮。</p>
<p>翌日並有非正式的比賽。冰忽融解一二吋。抵深處幾成池澤。各車駛過時。冰花飛揚。如大雨傾盆。賽員觀衆。避之不及。全身浸濕。可比淋浴之後。然一刹那間。車已去之數哩。無法設想。亦屬趣聞也。</p>

<p>Continuous Progress</p>
<p>The vanguard has reached the vicinity of Tai'an, with Han Fuju's troops arriving at Guodian.</p>
<p>(Bengbu) Road Dispatch: The Sino-British forces are counter-attacking Jinan along the Jiaoji Railway, repeatedly defeating the Jin forces. The progress is very rapid, only tens of miles from the city, and recovery is imminent. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Road Dispatch: The Central Army on the Jinpu Railway is pressing the enemy with heavy troops. The vanguard has advanced to the north of Qufu. The telephone and telegraph lines between Qufu and Yanzhou are being repaired, and military trains can now travel smoothly to Yanzhou. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Gong Yuncun, Director of Political Training at the Xuzhou Headquarters, arrived in Xuzhou from the front. Gong told reporters that since He went north to command the Jinpu Railway military operations, he had calmly arranged everything, and progress was extremely rapid. Han's troops on the Jiaoji Railway are advancing in multiple directions. Once a general offensive is launched against the enemy, the entire situation can be resolved. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Qian Zongze led a materials train north on the morning of the 14th to repair the railway tracks destroyed by the enemy. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Remnants near Qufu have been cleared by the Central Army. A Relief Committee has been established in Qufu to investigate losses caused by the soldiers and to provide relief. The committee issued a circular on the 13th stating that when the Jin army besieged the city, they engaged in rape and pillage. Five families outside the West Gate were raped.</p>
<p>Heavy artillery was used to bombard the city, damaging sacred sites, etc. (14th) (Xuzhou) He Yaozu, having arranged things securely at the front, with the Central Army already advancing, returned to Xuzhou at 2 PM on the 14th on an armored train. He will go west to meet Chiang to report on the situation. Garrison Commander Song Runtian and representatives from all sectors welcomed him at the station. He told reporters at the station that the vanguard of our army has reached the vicinity of Tai'an. The enemy in the Da Wenkou area will be completely eliminated within days. The morale of our army is very high, and we can restore Tai'an in the shortest possible time. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Confirmed Report: The vanguard of Han Fuju's troops has reached Guodian, planning a general offensive on Jinan. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Relief Committee after the Battle of Qufu telegraphed the National Government and the Central Party Headquarters, saying that Qufu, a small town, is clearly the birthplace of sages and a place admired by China and the world. After the success of the Northern Expedition and the establishment of peace, people lived in harmony and were unafraid of calamities. Unexpectedly, recently, the chaotic Yan Xishan, who loves to create disorder, chanted about propriety and yielding but fired thousands of shells, destroying our famous sacred sites. Claiming justice, he besieged the city for ten days, killing our innocent poor people. Fortunately, our Central Army, with soldiers who did not abandon their posts, protected our people and advanced rapidly,</p>
<p>lifting the siege of our city. However, the rebellious army, with its unfulfilled ambitions, inflicted disaster on our people. They conscripted soldiers, raped, and pillaged outside the city of Qufu, acting worse than bandits. According to reports, five families outside the West Gate of Qufu were raped, and the number of those who were too ashamed to report is unknown. Villages outside the city were completely looted. The people of Qufu are in despair. Those living inside the city could not avoid the shelling, and those living outside the city could not escape the violence of the brutal soldiers. We are heartbroken by this tragedy. Our committee is a temporary organization formed by local groups for relief. Our responsibility is to accurately investigate the damage and earnestly provide relief. We are working day and night to make progress. However, this matter is of great importance, and we fear that our efforts will be insufficient. The brutality of the rebellious army is extreme, and it will not be easy to succeed without a collective denunciation. We respectfully submit the findings of our recent investigations for your consideration. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Military Dispatch: Feng mobilized the southern part of the Longhai Line and increased forces to the north of the Longhai Line. On the night of the 12th, they attacked our right-wing army, attempting to cut off our connection between the Jinpu and Longhai lines. The Central Army met them in battle, and by the 13th, the enemy had collapsed with heavy losses. (14th Dispatch) (Nanjing) Road Dispatch: Taking advantage of the tension in the Shandong war, Feng's army on the Longhai Line launched a counter-attack on the night of the 12th, attempting to connect with the Jin army in western Shandong. Due to the collapse of Shi Yousan's troops, they had no ability to respond. Urgently mobilizing their direct lineage remnants from the Qixian, Tongxu, and Weishi areas, they gathered in Kaocheng and launched a full-force attack on our right wing. Our army calmly responded and suppressed them with fierce artillery fire. After a bloody battle lasting the entire night, the enemy could not withstand it and began a major retreat on the morning of the 13th.

<p>There is Talk of Drafting an Outline for Government Organization</p>
<p>(Beijing) Today, the Expanded Committee is discussing party affairs at the Oriental Hotel. There is talk of drafting an outline for government organization. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Expanded Committee decided that since the meeting venue is in Huai Ren Tang, and the university's office and affiliated cultural institutions were originally located in Huai Ren Tang, military and police officials will summon the university office committee tomorrow and order them to move out within a specified period and find a suitable location so that the move will not interfere with the university's office. (15th Dispatch) Zou Lu in Beijing spoke again about governing the army through the party, saying that if one person is allowed to monopolize power, it will inevitably lead to personal dictatorship.

<p>(Beijing) Ji Gongquan performed the opening ceremony after the expansion reached a compromise and reconciliation. Yesterday, he received a summons from Yan, and tonight he will return to report on the mission. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Now that the expanded meeting has been established, the young and vigorous fighters centered on Chen Gongbo of the reorganization faction in Beijing have suddenly become arrogant and intoxicated, posting slogans everywhere in the busiest areas of the city, resembling the scene of the Wuhan government in the past. They have now begun to promote mass movements to various schools and organizations. However, the military faction in Shanxi, which is responsible for establishing the government and maintaining public order, is quite displeased with this move and a fierce secret struggle has broken out between them and the reorganization faction, the outcome of which will greatly affect the future new government. (15th Japanese Alliance Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Some Chinese believe that the reorganization faction, which had the closest relationship with labor and peasant Russia in the past, has recently been revived, and they are deeply afraid that a second Wuhan government era will appear and the Red Russians will be active again. They are very worried. However, the Russian journalist Strelnikov of the TASS news agency in Beijing, as well as Russians studying in Beijing to study the Chinese situation, all expressed the same view: Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo are completely opportunists today and are very different from the past. They are now pouring all their efforts into fighting for power, like madly running jackals. We have no meaning or expectation for their revival or failure. They will fulfill their selfish desires and do their best to fight for power, making the internal strife in China even more profound. (15th Japanese Alliance Dispatch)</p>

The contents of the convention state that it applies to cargo ships of more than 1,600 tons engaged in international navigation. Ships built after July 1 next year should be constructed and equipped in accordance with the provisions of the convention. Existing ships must also be modified and equipped separately in accordance with the convention. Our country's situation is different from that of other maritime countries, and implementation is quite difficult. Whether to join part or all of it is being carefully considered by the Ministry of Communications. However, its annex, the navigation and reef avoidance chapter, is based on the old chapter signed in Washington in 1884, with more detailed revisions, and should be joined in order to be consistent with other countries. The Ministry of Communications is currently consulting with the Ministries of Navy and Finance, and a decision can be made soon. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Negotiations Regarding the Italian Aviator Distributing Leaflets <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The matter of the Italian aviator Basanes crashing his French plane into a mountain on the Saint Gotthard Pass is a very ordinary matter. The Italians became alarmed when they learned that the plane was going to Milan to distribute anti-fascist leaflets. They were further alarmed when they learned that the plane's passport was issued by France and the leaflets were provided by Switzerland. They were greatly angered by both France and Switzerland. Their newspapers directly denounced Paris as the center of anti-fascist crimes and Switzerland as its second source, and said that this case would have serious consequences. If it harms Italy's interests, they would have to amend the friendship treaty. Their anger and resentment were almost unstoppable. In fact, this matter is very easy to understand. Basanes applied for an aviation license at the time, falsely claiming that he was going to Switzerland to participate in an international aviation competition, so the French side gave it to him without suspicion. After the plane arrived in Switzerland, a truck secretly delivered leaflets to the plane at a small airfield near Vileneuve, so the airfield staff did not notice. This kind of negligence is also a common occurrence in reason. Moreover, the person flying the plane to distribute leaflets was Italian, not French or Swiss. Once explained, it should be easy to dispel any doubts. But the Italians repeatedly attacked and threatened, treating it as a great grievance. Why? Because things are easy to explain when both sides have no disagreement. If there is disagreement, then doubts, misunderstandings, and excuses can arise at any time. Even a very small matter can lead to a very serious situation. The conflict between Italy and France recently is over the issue of naval shipbuilding. A rift has developed in diplomatic relations. The Italians' suspicion of France has been accumulating. And the anti-fascist movement is deeply resented by the Italians. So, regardless of the truth of the matter, they resolutely used it as an outlet. According to today's Paris dispatch, the military is on high alert along the Italian-French border in southern France. All cities are preparing for aerial attacks. Rumors are rife. The tension is such that it is all due to long-standing accumulated grievances. Otherwise, how could a small matter of an airplane distributing leaflets lead to such a situation?</p>

<h3 id="e9">Commander-in-Chief Chiang <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Message to Officers and Soldiers at the Front</p>
<p>(Hankou) Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued a message to the officers and soldiers at the front,</p>
<p>which arrived in Hankou on the 14th and was immediately sent to the front for distribution. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Yan Feng and others have betrayed the party and the country, disrupted unification, and allied with Zhang Gui, Min Lu, and communist bandits in various places, causing disturbances everywhere, in order to achieve their goals. They will surely cause the party and the country to perish, so as to achieve their goal of betraying the country and harming the people. Their plan is extremely cunning. Fortunately, the spirit of our Premier in heaven and the joint efforts of all the generals and soldiers at the front, for the sake of the party and the country, have struggled together, without fear of hardship and danger, pressing forward in succession, not hesitating to sacrifice, and finally winning victories repeatedly, repeatedly thwarting the rebellious forces. At present, Zhang Gui and Lu's rebellious forces have been gradually wiped out by our army, and the rebellious forces of Feng Yan and others in the north are also exhausted, and their salaries and bullets are in short supply. The Jin banknotes have fallen to about 20 cents. The soldiers cannot get a full meal all day long. Even if we do not attack, the internal disputes of the rebellious army are complicated, and there is a tendency to collapse. However, neglecting the danger is a lesson from the past. If we do not take this opportunity to completely eliminate them, leaving them as obstacles, unification will not be realized, and the Three Principles of the People will not be implemented. For the sake of a permanent solution, the central government has divided and transferred the armies of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to the front, in order to completely eliminate them. However, transportation and deployment will take a considerable amount of time. It is estimated that the decisive battle will take place in at least 20 days, or at most a month. We hope that all our generals and soldiers will muster their courage, continue their efforts, reorganize their positions and fortifications, deepen the inner and outer trenches, so that when the enemy comes, we can wait for them in an orderly manner, and when the enemy leaves, we can hide and recuperate, maintain strict defense, and conduct reconnaissance at all times, without being negligent or careless. We must win the final victory, and not fail because of a small mistake. This commander-in-chief has high hopes. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-American aviation contract was officially signed on the 4th. It is said that the contract is based entirely on the principle of equality, and the contents are as follows: (1) The joint venture company established in accordance with the contract must be handled in full compliance with our country's laws. (2) Our side accounts for 55% of the company's capital, and all rights are proportional to the amount of shares. In addition to the assets of the original China Aviation Corporation being used as part of the company's capital, all expenses for the aviation sector handled by the Ministry of Communications and all assets of the Shanghai-Chengdu aviation operation over the years are also used as company assets. (3) The management power of the company belongs to the board of directors, and more than half of the American directors are Chinese. Other administrative and business personnel such as the chairman and general manager are mostly Chinese. (4) The company's capital and assets should be deposited in a Chinese national bank, and the American company's bookkeeping and accounting must be in Chinese. (5) The company's routes are subject to time limits, and postal matters are subject to a separate contract between the General Post Office and the company. All measures are stipulated according to the situation and needs of our country's postal, economic, and social affairs. (6) The American side must be responsible for providing our country with training, such as opportunities for aviation and postal transportation personnel. The shares of the original China Aviation Corporation given to the American Aviation Development Corporation have also been negotiated and cancelled. The Ministry of Communications believes that the contract is beneficial and harmless, and has submitted it to the government for record. The new company will still be named China Aviation Corporation, and the original special China Aviation Corporation, which is now difficult to continue due to the exhaustion of national funds, is requested to be abolished by decree.

<p>Military Alert on the Franco-Italian Border</p>
<p>Lyon Prepares to Hold Aerial Maneuvers</p>
<p>Saint Gotthard International Train Derailment</p>
<p>Milan, National Press Agency, 14th: Although police and militia have done their best to prevent people from picking up the anti-Fascist leaflets scattered in the sky by aviator Bassanesi on Friday, many have still fallen into the hands of the Italian people and are being secretly circulated. The leaflets are signed by the "Justice and Freedom Committee" and urge Italians to take up arms and overthrow the Fascist government.</p>
<p>Milan, National Press Agency, 14th: Italian newspapers continue to vehemently criticize the Swiss authorities for secretly protecting anti-Fascist conspiracies. The language used is very strong. For example, the semi-official "Italian People's Newspaper" claims that the Bassanesi case will have serious consequences. Paris is the central hub of anti-Fascist evils, and the Swiss canton of Ticino is its second source. This is not only about Switzerland's internal affairs but is also enough to affect Italian interests. Switzerland's friendship is a good thing, but if it harms Italian interests, the only option is to revise the friendly treaty between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bern, National Press Agency, 14th: Swiss newspapers have reacted with indignation to the Italian newspapers' strong criticism of the Swiss government for failing to adhere to its neutral duties in the Bassanesi case of flying to Milan to scatter leaflets. For example, the "Bern Newspaper" claims that the pilot in the case was Italian, and the aircraft was French. The Swiss authorities have not been negligent in their duties. If the Italian authorities attach so much importance to this case, it is enough to show their deep fear that the anti-Fascist movement abroad will infiltrate and grow within the country. According to semi-official sources, the Swiss government has ordered the arrest of Bassanesi, accusing him of illegally flying over a national defense restricted area. However, it is expected that this is just a routine procedure, as Bassanesi can easily prove that he entered the area by mistake due to dense fog, which is not a crime.</p>
<p>Paris, National Press Agency, 14th: The incident of Italian aviator Bassanesi flying to Milan to scatter anti-Fascist leaflets, due to the Italian newspapers' constant attacks and threats against France and Switzerland, is still attracting great attention from people throughout France. It is now known that Bassanesi's aircraft license was obtained in Paris just a few days before departure, and his reason for leaving France was to participate in an international air race in Switzerland. Therefore, the French side did not suspect that he had political intentions. It was also found that Bassanesi had been ordered to leave France by the French authorities last year due to his involvement in political activities. He was only allowed to stay in France after signing a pledge to maintain good behavior. There are many rumors circulating in Paris about the military alert in southern France, especially along the Franco-Italian border, although none of them can be confirmed. This shows the public's heightened emotions. For example, the "Commentary Daily" reported that all cities in southern France are preparing to defend against aerial attacks. At the end of this month, Lyon will have large-scale aerial maneuvers, and local civil and military officials will jointly practice all necessary facilities in a real aerial war.</p>
<p>Milan, National Press Agency, 14th: Today, a Saint Gotthard Railway international express train derailed, injuring seven people, but fortunately, no one was killed. The Italian authorities claim that this was a conspiracy by enemy parties, with several sleepers having been removed, which has caused quite a stir.</p>

<p>Reuters, Paris, 14th: French Foreign Minister Briand recently sent a letter to the Italian government informing them that the French government intends to temporarily suspend the 1930 warship construction program before December this year in order to maintain the naval status quo during the Franco-Italian naval arms talks. After receiving this letter, the Italian government has now replied, stating that Italy is willing to suspend all warship construction work during this period.</p>

<p>Chanting "Long Live Nahas!"</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 15th: The Egyptian National Party Committee ordered a general strike for two hours to express mourning for the victims of the clashes between the people and the police in Mansoura on July 8. Although the committee earnestly advised supporters of the National Party not to disrupt public order or stage demonstrations, a large team of youths gathered on Muhammad Ali Street today and were dispersed by the police with batons. Then the demonstrators lined up and paraded through the major streets, clapping their hands and chanting "Long Live Nahas!" and holding up portraits of Nahas. Then they smashed shop windows and threw stones at the police. The police, outnumbered, quietly retreated.</p>

<p>Stalin Re-Elected as Party Leader</p>
<p>Moscow, National Press Agency, 14th: Strange results have occurred in the re-election of members of the Political Bureau and the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. Prominent right-wing leaders of the opposition, such as Rykov and Uglanov, have been elected as members of the Political Bureau. Bukharin and Tomsky have been elected as members of the Central Executive Committee.

In addition, three supporters of him were newly elected into the Political Bureau. After the closing speech by the Chairman of the Soviet Republic, Kalinin, the Sixteenth Congress adjourned.</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with the Simon Report</p>
<p>Anti-British Activities Continue in Various Places</p>
<p>Simla, Reuters, 14th: Indian princes gathered here today to consider how to express their views on the Simon Report. It is reported that although the princes agree to cooperate in implementing the Indian Federal Plan and are willing to join the Great Indian Council, they are dissatisfied with the Simon Commission's proposed financial arrangements. They also stated that the establishment of an Indian Supreme Court is a necessity for the Indian Federation, but the investigation team did not include this in its report, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 14th: The Indian government reported on the past week's events in India ending last Saturday, stating that the Waziris tribe outside the southern border, under the command of several leaders, had anti-British activities again this week. On the 6th, they attacked a British military outpost, and on the 8th, they joined forces and bombarded it with artillery. However, the defending soldiers swept them with machine guns, silencing the enemy's artillery, and the attackers retreated. They returned the next morning but were still scattered. There were many casualties, and the artillerymen probably also died. On the 10th, British reinforcements arrived, and the enemy destroyed several stations built by pro-British tribes and retreated. British troops and aircraft pursued the enemy and inflicted heavy losses. Non-violent resistance movements are still underway in various parts of India. Some places are more active than others, while others are quite calm. Overall, this movement shows signs of exhaustion. However, the mobs in Bengal are significantly more active than before.</p>

<p>Warsaw, National Press Agency, 14th: Today, there was an anti-German riot in front of the German Embassy here. The Polish police dispersed it after arresting many people. Several people who attacked the embassy have been prosecuted according to law. This demonstration by the Polish people was obviously triggered by the National Congress held by the people of Omland and Mielżyn, which decided by a majority vote to commemorate the tenth anniversary of belonging to Germany, so they demonstrated in front of the German Embassy to protest.</p>
<h3 id="e54">US Special Conference Continues Debate on Naval Treaty <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Difficult for Opponents to Achieve Victory</p>
<p>Washington, Associated Press, 14th: The US Senate special conference, after a brief pause last week, continued to meet today. Senator Robinson expressed his support for the London Naval Treaty, saying that the Senate should immediately ratify the treaty; otherwise, the international community would enter a period of instability and mutual suspicion. As a result, naval construction would surge, becoming a crisis unprecedented in history. Although some people are hoping for the discovery of this fact in order to profit from it, the majority of public opinion in all countries is against the trend of naval expansion. In recent days, the press and people in the Senate have been busy estimating the number of votes on both sides of the naval treaty. The fact that there are 20 senators against the treaty is undeniable. In total, there are 96 senators attending the meeting, and the opposition must have at least 33 votes to win. Some opposition senators are convinced that delaying the debate is the only way to shift public opinion.</p>

<p>Textile Industry Seeks to Reverse the Recession</p>
<p>Silk Factories Close and Unemployment Increases</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communication, 15th: The representatives of cotton-related companies met at the Industrial Club last night. The results of the agreement were: (1) In order to promote the export of cotton yarn and cloth, it was decided to open up new sales routes and send investigation teams to Northern Europe and South Africa; (2) Representatives of Toyo Spinning, Kanebo, Dai Nippon Spinning, and Itochu will go to Northern Europe in mid-August, and representatives of Toyo Cotton and Japan Cotton will go to South Africa in late August. After deciding on the above three items, the meeting adjourned late at night. This is because the future of the Japanese cotton industry is in a recession. The increase in Indian tariffs and the decline in silver prices have affected trade with China, leading to stagnation, resulting in daily decline. This case was considered as the only way to open up.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communication, 15th: Fuji Silk Company has closed the entire Yamada factory in Ikeda. More than 400 workers have lost their jobs. The textile operators in Shizuoka City have also been indefinitely suspended from today. The silk manufacturers' roundtable conference in Maebashi City was held last night, and the debate was fierce. Although some argued that closing at this time would only accelerate bankruptcy and strongly opposed it, the result was still a decision for all 60 affiliated factories to suspend operations temporarily. As a result, 7,000 employees lost their jobs.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Parliamentarians</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 14th: Foreign Secretary Henderson said in the House of Commons today that the Chinese government has not initiated negotiations to recover the Xiamen Gulangyu Public Concession, but in recent years there have been various proposals to increase the political participation rights of Chinese in the concession. These proposals have been earnestly implemented. If China has any further proposals regarding this matter in the future, it is expected to receive a sympathetic response from the British government. Overseas Trade Minister Gillett said that the proposal to send an economic observation group to the Far East was proposed by the Overseas Trade Development Council. The council discussed the matter with representatives from various industries and then consulted with major commercial organizations. In April of this year, the government appointed Sir Peel as a special envoy to investigate overseas markets. After taking office, Peel began a detailed investigation of domestic and foreign business conditions. He has not yet gone overseas. The government intends to use him as a member of the Far East Economic Inspection Group. The government is also considering sending personnel to Russia to investigate the economy.</p>

<h3 id="e65">78th Meeting of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The 78th meeting of the Executive Yuan was held on the 15th. Tan Yankai, Sun Ke, Wang Zhengting, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, and Wang Boqun attended. Zheng Hongnian, Chen Yi, Zhang Wohua, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yu, and Zeng Yangfu were present as observers. Tan Yankai chaired the meeting. Matters discussed: (1) Education Minister Jiang Menglin proposed that the 328,000 yuan in temporary fees requested by the Beiyang Institute of Technology in Tianjin be allocated appropriately, and that the institute's recurring expenses be approved and determined according to the original budget of 276,000 yuan for the 19th fiscal year reviewed by the ministry, without further reduction, in order to maintain the institute. Resolution: The temporary fees will be allocated by the Ministry of Education in consultation with the Russian Fund Committee, and the recurring expenses will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the amount of 276,000 yuan determined by the ministry. (2) Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi reported that he was instructed to review the case of whether the time for shop employees to join or leave employment could be changed to the Gregorian calendar as the standard. In accordance with the investigation, the customs of various industries and professions for shop employees to join or leave employment are different. It seems that it is still permissible to temporarily follow the old customs of various places and industries, and there is no need to stipulate a uniform date. However, since it has been clearly ordered that the Gregorian calendar be used for merchants' accounts, private contracts, and all documents and books, the old time for these shop employees to join or leave employment should be uniformly changed to the Gregorian calendar to comply with the law. Resolution: Approved according to the ministry's deliberation. (3) The Hankou Municipal Government reported that it had changed Hante City to Hankou City in compliance with the order, and requested that the various bureau chiefs and personnel recommended by the government be appointed in accordance with the newly formulated municipal organization law, immediately revoked, and reappointed. Resolution: Forwarded to the National Government for reappointment. (4) The Navy Department requested the appointment of Cheng Meixian, former deputy captain of the Yingrui warship, as the major staff officer of the Navy Torpedo Guerrilla Team. Resolution: Forwarded to the National Government for appointment. (5) The Zhejiang Provincial Government reported that Lou Zhaojian, secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government, had requested to resign, and Liu Shixin would succeed him in the vacancy. Resolution: Approved and forwarded. (6) The Hunan Provincial Government reported that Wang Hanchuan, the second section chief of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, had been assigned to another position, and requested that Hu Nianseng be appointed to succeed him. Resolution: Approved and forwarded.</p>

<p>He Chengjun's representative, Gu Gengye, also arrives in Hankou. Correspondence from the Third Army Corps Commander, He Chengjun, previously sent his confidential secretary, Gu Gengye, to Liaoning to discuss military affairs with Zhang Xueliang, the Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, and to negotiate all matters. After arriving in Liaoning, Mr. Gu met with Mr. Zhang several times and negotiated everything. He had already reported to Commander He via telegram. At that time, the National Government specially appointed Mr. Zhang as the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Mr. Zhang believed that it was necessary to contact the authorities here at any time, and he also sent Major General Gao Shengyue, Lieutenant Colonel Liu Tongke, Major Cai Zhifang, etc., to Hankou with Mr. Gu. They departed from Shenyang on the 4th of this month, first went to Huludao to meet with Mr. Zhang and ask for instructions on everything, then transferred by ship to Shanghai, and arrived in Hankou on the 12th by the Yushun steamboat. They arrived at 7 p.m. on the 14th and stayed at the Taotao Hotel. He's representative, Gu Gengye, returned to the Third Army Corps headquarters' garrison office to rest. After the reporter arrived at the residence of Mr. Gao, he immediately drove to visit him. According to him, Commander Zhang has always been consistent in supporting the Central Government and cherishing peace. The current situation in China is such that unification cannot be hoped for without supporting the Central Government, and survival cannot be achieved without stopping disputes and resisting foreign aggression. Commander Zhang will base his advocacy on this, telegraphing Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang to persuade them to cease fighting and fulfill the previous agreement to go abroad, so as to avoid the scourge of war and the suffering of the people, etc. Gu Gengye also said that this time, he was ordered to go to Liaoning, and the negotiation was extremely successful. Commander Zhang is now in Huludao and will return to Liaoning Ning to officially assume his new position as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. As for the military affairs of the Northeast, Mr. Zhang had already made arrangements. If Yan and Feng still dare to go their own way, troops will be sent to suppress them, etc. It is heard that Gao Shengyue is Mr. Zhang's official representative, and Liu Tongke and Cai Zhifang are military liaison officers. They plan to go to the headquarters in the morning of the 15th to pay their respects to He Yingqin, and on the 16th they will go to Luohe to pay their respects to He Chengjun to report everything in person. Whether they will be stationed in Hankou or at the front is yet to be decided. He's representative, Gu Gengye, will also go to the front to report on the negotiations with Mr. Zhang.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hua Jueming, Secretary-General of the Third Army Corps Headquarters and Secretary-General of the Hubei Provincial Government, followed He Chengjun to the front, and was recently ordered to return to Hankou to discuss important matters with Wu Xingya, the Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government. The reporter met him at a certain place yesterday. According to him, the war situation on all fronts and the recent political situation in Hubei Province are very detailed. His words are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>On the Ping-Han Railway front, after the enemy's main force, Zhang Weixi's troops, were defeated by the Central Army, Feng retreated to the vicinity of Xuchang. The Central Army repeatedly challenged and lured the enemy into an ambush. In recent days, the enemy's elite troops have suffered heavy losses. The Battle of Maleji was particularly devastating. It is estimated that after three nights of fierce fighting, more than 800 enemy soldiers were killed, more than 1,000 were captured, more than 2,000 rifles were seized, dozens of machine guns, and more than 40 mortars. Commander He was at the front with Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Hao Menglin, Yang Hucheng, and other generals to discuss the strategy of attack, which has already been decided. There will definitely be progress within a few days. Chief of Staff Chen Guangzu recently received an order from Commander-in-Chief Chiang to personally inspect the front line by plane. It is reported that the Central Army at the front is in extremely high spirits, and the enemy troops have no will to fight. In the shortest possible time, Xuchang and Zhengzhou should be completely recovered. On the Jinpu Railway front, after the Central Army captured Dawenkou, it advanced rapidly towards Tai'an. The Jin troops Feng Pengzhu and Chuan Zuoyi's troops have been surrounded. After they are eliminated, they should drive straight in. The Longhai Railway front, which connects with the Jinpu and Ping-Han Railway lines, is also making steady progress. It will soon be possible to directly attack Kaifeng. On the Hunan front, Zhang Guigui's troops were relentlessly pursued and severely attacked by the Central Army, and suffered heavy losses. Yongzhou and Quanzhou were successively occupied by the Central Army. The enemy's Independent Third Regiment, about 1,000 people, completely surrendered. They are now fleeing to Guilin, and the Central Army is pursuing them in victory. On the northern Hubei front, the enemy's Liu Ruming's troops previously invaded Laohekou in Guanghua. They were jointly repelled by the 51st Division Fan Shisheng and the Independent First Brigade Xu Dezu directly under the Third Army Corps. They fled to the Zhangjiadian area and were intercepted by Army Commander Yang Hucheng, and have been surrounded and disarmed.</p>
<p>As for the political affairs of Hubei Province, there are currently two things that can be reported: one is the scheduled establishment of the new budget meeting, and the other is the preparation and commencement of the four yarn and hemp bureaus. It is understood that the Provincial Government previously discussed and decided on the budget committee for the 19th year of the province, and also formed an organization of all committee members. Zhang, the Director of Finance, also submitted the opinion book on the budget for the 19th year of revenue and expenditure to the 35th meeting of the Provincial Government, which was decided and handed over to the Budget Committee. The committee decided to establish it on the 16th. Regarding opinions on the budget book, such as streamlining agencies, reducing expenses, eliminating concurrent salaries, and changing budget items, there will be detailed discussions for implementation. As for the four yarn and hemp bureaus, they were originally leased by the Fuyuan Company. The company deliberately stopped work for many days, which greatly affected the lives of all employees. It was specially decided to take them back and take over the operation. Now, 200,000 yuan has been borrowed as funds, and a manager has been appointed to actively prepare, and work will commence within a few days. (July 14)</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The assassination of Xu Zhuoran has become a serious case unprecedented in Fujian. On the one hand, Xu's position in the history of the Party and his relationship with the Min Bureau over the years have made him a key figure in the Min Bureau. His death has attracted great attention from the Fujian Provincial Government and overseas Chinese in Nanyang. On the other hand, after the suspect Chen Delin was arrested, he confessed that he was instigated by Ye Yuan and Chen Yanxiang. Ye has been in charge of the nine schools of Jimei for ten years, and has become the only important figure in the education sector in Fujian Province. Chen Jiageng, the principal of Jimei School, intended to suspend the operation of Jimei School after Ye was imprisoned. Therefore, the movement to support Ye became more urgent. Ye recently wrote a letter to Fang Shengtao in prison, strongly arguing that he was framed. The main points he raised were: (1) If he had a premeditated plan to kill Xu, he would definitely not ask Xu to a certain place, and he would definitely not leave a business card with his name and address in his own handwriting to arouse suspicion. (2) If he had a premeditated plan to kill Xu, he would definitely not write his telephone number. Having a telephone number means that he would be able to contact him by telephone, not ask him to come. (3) He described the course of his grievances and antagonism with Chen Delin, and that he had been arguing with Chen Yanxiang for a long time and was very incompatible with him. Xu was a benefactor to one of them and an old friend to the other. He and Pan Tu Township had asked officials and soldiers to handle the case of theft at the school, and he definitely had no intention of killing Xu to seek grievances and was not close to those close to Xu, etc. Chen Delin's confessions at the Tong'an Education Corps Judicial Office and the Zhangzhou Newly Compiled First Division Military Law Office were all the same, until on July 5, when he was escorted to the Zhangxia Navy Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office for interrogation, Chen suddenly reversed his previous confession and denied that he had participated in the assassination of Xu and that Ye and Chen had instigated the assassination of Xu. That night, Ye Yuan and Chen Yanxiang were granted bail by the court to await trial. According to reports, the headquarters received a telegram from the Civil Service Department of the National Government yesterday, saying, "All parties have telegraphed about this case, and the truth is unclear. Ye Yuan should be temporarily released on bail to await trial, so as not to hinder education." The headquarters immediately notified the court, and the court granted bail. After Ye Yuan was released from prison, Ye Weitai and others, representatives of Jimei School, sued Qin Wangshan, Li Aihuang, Li Hanqing, Zou Chun, and Ye Qingquan, five staff members of Xu's funeral office, to the Siming Court of the headquarters on the 10th, demanding that they be charged with reverse sitting. The headquarters did not accept the case because it belonged to the judiciary.</p>

<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the New Equatorial Instrument Dome</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The groundbreaking ceremony for the new equatorial instrument dome of the Qingdao Observatory was held at 4 p.m. on the 5th of this month at the construction site in the northwest corner of the observatory. Those who attended the meeting included Mayor Ge, Councilors Zhou, Han, and Zhang, the heads of various bureaus, the director of the Agricultural and Forestry Institute, and about 40 other staff members of the observatory. After the ceremony was completed, the mayor performed the groundbreaking ceremony, followed by the director of the observatory reporting the mayor's instructions. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>The Director of the Observatory, Jiang, reported on the background of the situation, saying, "Astronomy developed earliest in our country, but the techniques of the ancients are mostly secret and not passed on, and there is no active research on the improvement of observation instruments, so it has fallen behind. This is truly regrettable. In the early years of the Qing Dynasty, Nan Huairen, Tang Ruowang, and others were used to manufacture astronomical instruments for observation, which was quite prosperous for a time. However, since the invention of the telescope, this instrument can only be regarded as an antique. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Central Observatory also planned to build an observatory, but due to the excessive cost, it was difficult to plan, and it was not realized. This observatory was founded by the Germans and managed by the Japanese. The astronomical equipment is also quite simple. After our country took over, because there was a German office in the meteorological observation field, which was badly damaged, it was rebuilt into a dome room, and the original 16 cm diameter equatorial instrument was installed, and a solar and lunar photography device was purchased from the German Zeiss factory for research. By making do with what was available, it could still be used with difficulty. The measured results were also published. In the fifteenth year, the International Meridian Measurement Association invited the observatory to participate in the International Meridian Measurement. Although it was falsely adopted in the international academic community, the astronomical equipment of this observatory has become an urgent matter. At that time, although the former Commercial Port Bureau issued 5,000 yuan for application, it could only purchase high-level instruments and radio transceivers necessary for measuring longitude, etc., and could not provide sufficient equipment. Moreover, the city's financial resources were not enough for this construction, so a plan was formulated to request the Education and Culture Foundation Board of Directors to subsidize 25,000 yuan. In July of the 17th year, the meeting decided to allow the subsidy. Immediately, the prices were investigated in various countries. The price of the French Poilin factory was reasonable, and it was decided to purchase a 32 cm diameter double-tube equatorial instrument of the sky map type, and an 8 cm diameter meridian instrument with a superhuman microscopic ruler for 1,754 pounds of British gold, and 360 pounds of British gold. According to the gold price at that time, there was still a surplus of 1,000 yuan for construction. Since the 18th year, the gold price has been rising daily, and the pre-estimated amount has been insufficient. At that time, another request was made to the association, and an additional 4,000 yuan was obtained, totaling 29,000 yuan of national currency in subsidies from the association. The gentlemen who are enthusiastic about promoting astronomy are very grateful. However, the manufacture of this instrument takes time, so it has not yet arrived. According to a letter from the factory, it can arrive in Qingdao at the end of August. This is the report on the purchase</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>of the instrument. As for the construction, it can be divided into two parts: one is the dome equatorial instrument room, and the other is the meridian instrument room. The diameter of the dome is 7 feet 0.1 meters. It was ordered from abroad, but the value must be more than 1,000 pounds, calculated at the usual gold price, it is still more than 10,000 yuan. It is now made by the Tianjin Shengchang Foreign Firm. It is estimated that the inner iron frame of the dome with a diameter of 7.4 meters is lined with wood, and the outside is wrapped with copper skin with copper rails and a three-horse motor, worth 6,620 yuan of national currency. The observatory has three floors. The first floor is a cellar, storing the motor, and attached with a photography darkroom and enlargement room. The second floor is an office, equipped with a measuring and photographing machine. The third floor is equipped with an equatorial instrument. All engineering instructions have been requested from the Engineering Bureau for review. I would like to thank Yihua Factory for the contract, which costs 4,700 yuan of national currency. The meridian instrument room is built on the west side of the observatory, and the top of the room can be opened and closed. The construction cost is about 800 yuan. It is estimated that the total construction cost is 12,120 yuan. It is estimated that the funds raised are 3,000 yuan allocated by the Commercial Port Bureau for temporary expenses, 2,000 yuan self-raised by the observatory, 2,500 yuan subsidized by the Astronomical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, and 3,000 yuan recently approved by the mayor. In total, there is still a shortfall of more than 1,600 yuan. However, the entrance to the dome has been requested by the mayor to the Ministry of Finance for tax exemption, but it has not been approved, and several hundred yuan are still required. It is estimated that the shortfall is 2,000 yuan. The observatory is now requesting subsidies from all parties, but it is hoped that the mayor will provide special assistance to complete the work. The above is the report on the construction. At present, the astronomical undertakings in the country are flourishing. The Astronomical Observatory of Guangdong Zhongshan University was established last year. Although the instrument is not very large, the scale is very complete. It is heard that a new observatory is being built and larger instruments are being added. The Nanjing Astronomical Research Institute is also engaged in building an observatory on Zijin Mountain and will be established soon. Other places such as the Peiping Research Institute and Northeast University also have this plan. The construction of this observatory at this time also has considerable reference. Although the instruments purchased cannot be compared with the large astronomical observatories in Europe and the United States, they are not very small. In the future, I hope that the mayor will give instructions and guidance from all the guests."</p>
<p>The mayor's instructions were divided into three points. The first point was the history of Chinese astronomy. Chinese astronomy had considerable inventions in ancient times, but it declined due to the lack of researchers. In the early Qing Dynasty, Westerners Nan Huairen, Tang Ruowang, and others came to China and tried their best to support it, and cast several kinds of bronze instruments. The astronomical undertaking gradually turned around, but since the invention of the telescope, bronze instruments are equal to antiques and are of no practical use. Fortunately, in recent years, a small number of astronomers have purchased and used foreign instruments to vigorously study the astronomical undertaking, and it has begun to emit a glimmer of light. The second point was the evolution of the Qingdao Observatory. The Qingdao Observatory was founded by the Germans and then taken over by the Japanese. It was not taken back by China until the thirteenth year. However, Qingdao's income is limited and cannot support the full development of the astronomical undertaking of the observatory. Fortunately, Director Jiang, like a almsgiver, ran around raising funds, and was finally able to purchase instruments and build an equatorial instrument room, so that there is today's groundbreaking ceremony, and the development of the Chinese astronomical undertaking in the future is also its foundation. The third point was the importance of astronomy. People live in the world, under the sky and on the ground. Astronomy and meteorology are closely related to people's lives. I belong to the military, and first of all, from a military point of view, I have studied all the past wars, and their success or failure is often absolutely related to astronomy and meteorology. The navy is especially important, so the ancients said that the way to be a general must be to know astronomy above and geography below. Other aspects such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation of scholars, farmers, industry, and commerce are closely related to astronomy and meteorology, so all countries are vigorously studying astronomical undertakings, and their progress is rapid. China's astronomical undertaking has already emitted a glimmer of light, and Director Jiang has worked hard to operate it. In the small corner of Qingdao City, there is such a great astronomical equipment, which is really amazing. I hope that everyone will follow Director Jiang and work hard. Their achievements will be considerable, and I have no responsibility to expect. As for the economic aspect, the municipal government will provide assistance within its capacity, etc.</p>
<p>Then, Han An, a city councilor from Qingdao, delivered a speech. Finally, Director Jiang replied, saying that he was flattered by the guidance of the mayor and Councilor Han, and his colleagues will do their best to work hard so as not to live up to the mayor's and Councilor Han's kindness, and thanked the mayor and all the guests. Then, a photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>After Lingshan was captured by bandits for the second time, Xishan, Mabou, Liubo, Zhuang, and other places in the Liuan County area were also harassed. Residents of the area have been fleeing to the city of Liuan for days, reaching more than 4,000 people. However, the Sixth Pan Brigade stationed in Liuan refused to allow them to enter the city to prevent bandits from mixing in, so many refugees gathered at the Sanzhi School Dabeian or camped out in the northwest gate area. The agencies are now raising funds, issuing one silver dollar per person per day to make a living. (July 14)</p>

<p>An Inhumane Robbery Case: Luo Bugen's family in Kongjiaque West Zhujia Bridge was celebrating the third day of the birth of a son the day before yesterday, and guests came to congratulate them. The house was filled with joy. Unexpectedly, more than 20 bandits came that night, broke into the house, tied up the family, beat them, and forced them to pay money. They also pressed heavy stones on their bodies, injuring a total of four people. Bugen's life was the most dangerous. After being beaten, because he refused to say where the silver was hidden, the bandits used the newborn baby as an exchange condition for forcing silver dollars, claiming that if the hidden silver was not offered, they would kill the newborn baby. Helplessly, Bugen had no cash savings. Although he pleaded repeatedly, the result was that the newborn baby was killed. As for the sugar cakes, gifts, and all items sent by relatives, they were all robbed. A certain female guest's Xiangyun yarn trousers were also stripped off, exposing her lower body. Before leaving, they also borrowed 150 yuan, and agreed to pay the money at the Red Temple near Liujia Weir Village the next day. If they did not comply, they would burn the house in a few days as a threat. They then went to Yang Mingfang's house to rob. Mingfang heard the sound and got up immediately, ran out to beat the gong. The bandits dared to open fire to resist, with no restraint. Therefore, the loss was also huge. Others, such as Jiang Yuzhou's family in Ganxiang West Changyan, the Jin family in the north of Baziqiao, and Zheng Heshang's family in the south of Jiaolian, were all robbed one after another, suffering heavy losses.</p>

<p>Attempted Robbery and Kidnapping for Ransom</p>
<p>Wang A-san, from Chenxiang Village, Jingyun Township, Second District, is a farmer with a wife and child. His circumstances are ordinary. Around the spring of this year, he received five or six anonymous threatening letters demanding large sums of money. Wang ignored them and moved his valuables to relatives' homes. However, after 10 PM the other night, more than ten robbers armed with handguns, knives, and clubs knocked on his door, claiming they wanted to rent a cargo barge from A-san. Once inside, the robbers searched everywhere for half an hour, finding nothing of value. Enraged, they planned to kidnap A-san's son, but A-san had hidden himself before the robbers entered. Instead, they kidnapped A-san and took him outside. Not far from his home, a neighbor named Cai A-chuan followed them, pleading for his release. The robbers fired two shots at Cai, who then knelt and begged on A-san's behalf, stating that Wang A-san had no property. After much pleading, the robbers demanded 500 yuan, but Wang A-san agreed to pay 200 yuan. Lacking cash at home, he borrowed from neighbors in the same alley and obtained only 20 yuan. He promised to pay the remaining amount within three days. Before leaving, the robbers left a mast lamp shade, instructing him to meet someone carrying a mast lamp without a shade at Zhangtang Bridge when paying the money. They then released A-san. Unable to pay the remaining amount, A-san reported the incident to the county government yesterday, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>Lay Down the Butcher Knife and Become a Buddha on the Spot</p>
<p>Xu Xuehai, a resident of Xinglong Bridge East, north gate of the city, is 48 years old and has four sons and three daughters. He hasn't yet taken a daughter-in-law. Xu, along with Jiang Ming-sheng and others, jointly runs the Hongyi Shun butcher shop at the Badou Alley entrance under the North Diaojiao Bridge. The business is doing quite well. However, Xu is usually charitable and enjoys resolving disputes for people, so he has no savings. Recently, due to local unrest, business has been slow. Xu became disheartened with commerce and focused on Buddhism, even muttering to himself and chanting Buddhist mantras, claiming he needed to go to Dushan Mountain in Taihu Lake to become a Buddha. Seeing this, his relatives hired a gasoline boat and a tugboat on the morning of the 14th and, along with his family, sent Xu to Jingxiu in the Tianhou Palace on Dushan Mountain in Taihu Lake, hoping to calm his mind.</p>

<p>Impact of Hurricanes and Rainstorms</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been unusually hot and muggy. Yesterday morning, the sky suddenly turned cloudy, and heavy rain poured down. Soon after, a hurricane struck suddenly. The old stove in the Li family's house in Caijia Alley outside the north gate collapsed due to disrepair. In Ma Alley, Houqi Street, a section of the wall in a resident's home also collapsed due to the hurricane. A wooden building owned by the Wang family, who own a woodworking shop at Shuigou Head outside the west gate, also collapsed due to the wind. Fortunately, no one was inside, and no one was injured. Many other poorly built houses in the city and countryside were also blown down. Two utility poles between Shitangwan and Fengzhuang were also blown down, disrupting traffic. Around 4 PM, a large poplar tree near Bodu Port was uprooted by the wind, crushing a 12-year-old Jiangbei child named Xiao Sanzi who was passing by under the tree, killing him. At the same time, a large tree in front of the Cao family's house at the end of the sand grave inside Guangfu Gate was also blown down, fortunately without injuring anyone. Because of the continuous rainfall in the fields, the rural crops were not damaged. All the boats, large and small, inside and outside the city, cast anchor to avoid the disaster. Yesterday (15th) morning, starting at 9 AM, heavy rain poured down again, but the wind was slightly less intense than before.</p>

<p>Collision of Two Boats Leads to Fatality</p>
<p>Wang Defeng, a native of Jiangbei, made a living by selling mud. A few days ago, he, his wife, his son and daughter-in-law and six others loaded a boat of mud at Jiantian on Luhu Town in Wujiang County to unload goods at Xiadianmiao Kiln in Zhejiang Province. When the boat reached Jiuqu Port, at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Sun Songlin, a villager from nearby Yaojiabang, sailed by on a boat harvesting aquatic plants and directly hit the mud boat. An argument ensued, and Sun's long-term worker, Sun Ajin, jumped onto the mud boat and started beating them. Because they were outnumbered, Sun gathered six or seven aquatic weed boats to surround Wang Defeng and his son and daughter. At the same time, he pushed Wang's wife and daughter-in-law into the river. At that time, his second son Wang Guolu was injured and swam to the Luhu Public Security Bureau to report the incident. The bureau immediately sent three police officers to the scene. They saw that Wang and his family of six were seriously injured and arrested Sun Songlin. Unexpectedly, his brother Xianglin dared to twist the patrolman into the field to try to help his brother escape. Fortunately, the police officers fought bravely and arrested the Sun brothers together. Later, a gentleman from the town guaranteed the criminal. The injured party was forced by the power to go to Suzhou for medical treatment. Unfortunately, the injuries were too serious and the bladder bone had been broken. When he returned to Luhu Town, Wang Defeng died at dusk on the 12th. The Public Security Bureau immediately pursued the murderer and first handed over the long-term worker Ajin to the case. The next morning, a secret report was received and Sun Songlin was arrested at the Jingchunlou Teagarden. Immediately, a document was prepared and transferred to the Wujiang County Office for handling. However, his eldest son, Wang Guofu, was in such deep sorrow that his mouth was split and his life was also in danger.</p>

<p>Dispute over the Price Increase of Electricity</p>
<p>It has recently been reported that the Department of Construction has drafted four methods for handling the dispute over the price increase of electricity. The whole county has been instructed to follow them.

The county government's reply stated that according to Article 11 of the Appeals Act, the original punishment does not lose its effect before the appeal is decided. Before receiving an order from the appeal agency to stop the execution, the company should still abide by the methods promulgated by the Department and immediately submit it to the Department of Construction for verification and instruction to comply.</p>

<p>Villagers in the Northern Countryside Committed Suicide Due to Hunger</p>
<p>The price of rice in Jiaxing is nearly 19 yuan per stone. It is difficult for ordinary people to eat grain, and they are really struggling to survive. The villagers in various villages are mostly empty due to continuous famines. At this time, when the new and old grains are not harvested, it is even more impossible to borrow money. Although the county government has organized low-priced sales, it is still a drop in the bucket and difficult to solve the problem. Recently, it was learned that the Wang family near Meijiadang in the northern countryside had not had rice to cook for days. Someone went out to borrow money to buy rice. When he returned home two days later, his wife had already hanged herself. Out of hatred, he first threw his two children, five and three years old, into the pond, and then hanged himself. The couple of a certain family in Dianshang also committed suicide one after another because they had been without food for many days. In addition, many villagers in various villages are eating chaff and dregs to fill their stomachs and eating only one meal a day. This situation is so tragic that people who hear it feel sad.</p>
<p>Jisheng Branch Plans to Establish a Medical Bureau</p>
<p>The weather in Jiaxing has been abnormal recently, and residents have been suffering from diseases. Many poor people have been unable to afford medical treatment and have not been able to recover. The Jiaxing Jisheng Branch plans to establish a medical bureau to benefit the poor. Yesterday, it convened a meeting of local people and medical personnel to discuss the matter. A unanimous resolution was passed to open a medical bureau on July 28 of the Gregorian calendar, with the 3rd, 6th and 9th being the consultation periods.</p>

<p>The County Government Cautiously Elects Township Chiefs and Deputies</p>
<p>Last year, the village chiefs and deputies in the Shangnan Village area of ​​Xiaoshan were still appointed by ordinary local bullies, so most of them were not formally elected, which caused dissatisfaction among the people. This time, in preparation for the election of township chiefs and deputies, the county government is taking it seriously. There are now several township materials. Because the people's psychology is often poisoned by the original village chiefs, they are willing to divide the villages. County Chief Du has approved all of them and ordered the district offices to divide them on a modern basis.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Gradual Increase in Silk Prices</p>
<p>New silk is on the market in the Huasha and Xiafang Bridge areas of Shaoshan. Because silk prices are expensive and silk sales are sluggish in various silk weaving factories, they are all waiting and seeing. Now the harvest of summer cocoons is only about 30%. The silk merchants are preparing raw materials for autumn and winter silk goods, so silk prices are gradually increasing. Since July 10, each silk shop has been selling fine silk for 71 yuan per 100 taels. Because fat silk is combined with summer cocoon silk, it is also priced at 50 yuan, which is two yuan higher than before. It is said that the price will still increase after the beginning of autumn.</p>

<p>Murder in the Case of Trafficking in Opium from Anhui</p>
<p>Last month, the Anhui Provincial Public Security Bureau cracked down on a large number of opium. Recently, a bloody murder case has occurred as a result. The process is recorded as follows: The opium traffickers outside the Dananmen Gate of Anhui City have been trafficked by Liang Qifeng, Si Lao Er, Ma Lao Wu, Ma Zuoshu and other ten people to Hankou, and the remaining opium merchants are allocated transportation costs. A batch of opium trafficked by Si and others from Hankou a few days ago was unfortunately seized. Another 1,800 taels were spared from being loaded on the ship. The seven traffickers negotiated with Si and others, and Liang Qifeng and others wanted to divide them equally according to the amount of goods purchased by each trafficker. Each 100 taels could be allocated more than 18 taels. Si Liang and others returned to Anhui from Hankou a few days ago and brought back the soil for inspection. Only more than 1,500 taels were found. Liang went to Si on the morning of the 10th to reason with him. He first went to Fugui Building outside Dananmen to use force. After mediation, Liang learned that the city was very close to the south city, and the military police were standing in large numbers, so he invited Si to Yingjianglou Teahouse along the river. Before he could say much, Liang took out a sharp knife about a foot long and stabbed Si's abdomen under the muscles. Blood flowed like a pillar and he fell to the ground in pain. Si's family heard the news and immediately gathered a crowd to support Si back. Liang was also anxious and stabbed his thigh three times with the original knife, mistakenly stabbing his scrotum and lower abdomen, causing serious injuries. He was taken to Boru Hospital in the city and could not be treated and died. Si was also taken to the hospital by his family. Although the injuries were serious, they were not life-threatening. Liang's mother and wife carried Liang's body to Si's house to ask for trouble. Si's family all hid in the hospital. After many mediations, the opium obtained by the opium traffickers was returned at the original price. There were a total of 2,000 yuan, of which 400 yuan was used for Liang's funeral expenses, and the rest was temporarily preserved. If Si was seriously injured and died, it would be divided equally. If Si was fine, Liang's family would get it all to themselves. The bloody case was settled. Educational News</p>

<h3 id="e88">Japan Prevents Ideological Excess <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The More Student Unrest is Suppressed, the More Intense it Becomes</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Tokyo Correspondence: The training policy for students in Japanese schools takes a strict and oppressive approach, and the prevention of ideas is particularly meticulous. Students have no right to autonomy in school, and alumni associations and student associations are all run by the school. Extra-curricular self-study dormitories and dining halls are also supervised by school personnel, so the life of students has become mechanized. However, extreme pressure breeds rebellion, and prevention is not as good as defense, so that student thinking is gradually becoming left-leaning and secretly contacting left-leaning ideological groups outside the school, and gradually expressing resistance to the school's oppression. The education authorities regard the occasional disturbances in each school as a major problem, so during the era of Minister of Education Katsuda, they advocated ideological guidance and established a student affairs department within the Ministry of Education to specialize in preventing student thinking, and set up an ideological police agency to secretly investigate the actions of students and teachers. Student affairs officers and student affairs officers are set up in each school, guidance officers are adopted for each higher school, special lectures are implemented, and efforts are made to improve student life, promote self-cultivation, and encourage physical education to prevent ideological excesses. The number of tea shops and hemp shops has been increased to facilitate students' comfortable life and wear away their will. However, the practice has been effective, but it has been ineffective. There are a total of 25 national higher schools in the country, which are regarded by the Japanese education community as the most important schools, because their level is equivalent to that of high schools in our country, and they are established for students who aspire to enter the undergraduate program of the Imperial University. The recruitment of students is extremely strict, and most of the students are high-achieving graduates of middle schools, so they are very important. Last year, 11 schools experienced disturbances, accounting for almost half of the total. This year, the Urawa Higher School, the Matsuyama Higher School, and the Third Higher School have successively experienced class boycotts. The education authorities believe that the failure of ideological guidance will seek other ways to prevent it. (7th)</p>

<p>To be Implemented in Three Phases Starting Next School Year</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department, in view of the lack of elementary school teachers in the province and the desire to provide ongoing training for current elementary school teachers, believes that correspondence study is the most appropriate and effective method besides self-study. It is reported that starting from the 19th year (of the Republic), it plans to establish a Zhejiang Provincial Teacher Training Correspondence Department within the Education Department, to be implemented in three phases. After its establishment, its impact and effectiveness will surely be significant. The following are the measures: (1) The purpose of the Teacher Training Correspondence Department is to improve the academic ability of elementary school teachers throughout the province. (2) The Teacher Training Correspondence Department will enroll elementary school teachers from various counties and cities as students. (3) Elementary school teachers in various cities who voluntarily wish to become students should fill out an application form and resume one each before the start of each semester, and can directly register with the Research Department free of charge. However, research books must be provided by the students themselves. (4) The study program for students is divided into three phases, each phase lasting one semester. The books to be studied in each phase are specified as follows (listed separately). However, the Research Department may add, delete, or notify students of any necessary changes to the specified books at any time. (5) Students who complete the first phase will be tested by the Research Department (the method of examination is correspondence or entrusting the local education authorities). Those who pass will continue to study the second phase. Those who pass the second phase examination will study the third phase. Students who complete the three phases and pass the examination administered by the Research Department will be given a certificate. Students who obtain this certificate have the same qualifications as those who have attended vacation workshops three times and are exempt from the oral examination during elementary school teacher registration. However, those who fail the assessment must retake the course. (6) Students should submit a reading report every two months during the study period (report form attached). If there are any questions in the book, they can fill out a form and send it to the Research Department for a reply. However, the Research Department may also raise research questions and ask students to answer them when necessary. (7) The number of students is tentatively set at 1,000. (8) The Research Department is attached to the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department. (9) The head of the Research Department is concurrently the head of the Second Section of the Education Department. (10) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor Dear Editor, In the results of the inspection of party ideology education recently announced by our department, there are three gentlemen, Yuan Yeyu, Wu Xianren, and Yang Qingyuan. According to the statement, they are no longer responsible for teaching in the schools concerned this semester or have been responsible by other teachers who have not yet been determined. It has nothing to do with the three gentlemen and should be corrected. Please publish it in the Letters to the Editor column.

<p>Ticket collector at the theater: "Hey, sir, you're late tonight. The play is already halfway through."</p>
<p>Spectator: "It doesn't matter. Open the door gently for me and let me sneak in quietly. I certainly won't disturb the audience."</p>
<p>Ticket collector: "That's not it. I welcome you to sneak in. I'm just afraid that once the door is opened, everyone will sneak out quietly. That would look terrible on stage."</p>
<p>Judge (to a man accused of stealing a watch): "You have to be more careful in the future. Don't arouse suspicion. You can go now."</p>
<p>Defendant: "Since you're so polite, your honor, then I'll be polite too. I'll just give you this watch as a gift."</p>
<p>Master (rebuking his cook): "Today I came back at dawn. I told you not to tell the mistress. How dare you tell her?"</p>
<p>Cook: "I didn't tell her. It's just that the mistress asked me, 'When did the master come back?' I just replied to her with a very witty remark, saying, 'When the master came back, I was busy making breakfast and didn't have time to look at the clock to see what time it was.'"</p>

<h3 id="e114">The Socialite Murder of Her Husband: The Case of Yan Wenchou <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Philippines is imbued with European customs, where education for both men and women is equally developed. Women occupy a considerable position in society, making it arguably the most progressive country in the East regarding women's rights. However, in recent months, a case of a socialite murdering her husband has captured public attention. Each court session is so crowded that there is barely standing room. The next day, newspapers publish the story on their front pages with large headlines. The case has now been tentatively concluded with the verdict from the preliminary court. However, the story is so interesting that it must be shared with readers of "Free Talk."</p>
<p>The plaintiff in this case is a Filipino named Li Nao, a lawyer. He is a promising candidate for governor in a province of the Philippines in the next election. His wife is the younger sister of the president of the Central Women's University, a qualified lawyer and pharmacist, and a teacher at Central University. The couple has been married for over ten years, and their eldest son is fifteen. Unexpectedly, on the night of March 24th this year, Li Nao was murdered at home, sustaining injuries that were not fatal. The prosecutor filed a criminal indictment based on testimonies and evidence from various sources. The reasons given were: (1) The assailant confessed that the wife promised him two hundred dollars as a reward. (2) The driver who transported the assailant saw a woman of similar build to the wife beckoning the assailant into the residence when he got out of the car near the plaintiff's house that night. (3) Detectives found a piece of paper on the staircase in the house where the incident occurred, which read, "He is asleep but not deeply." Handwriting experts in court testified that it was written by the wife. The notebook from which the paper was torn was found in the wife's dressing table. Furthermore, the detective testified that when he found the paper, the wife offered him five hundred dollars to retrieve it. (4) There were two full-length mirrors in the injured man's bedroom, both smeared with chemicals to blur the reflection, clearly to prevent the lawyer from seeing the assailant enter the room in the mirror while lying in bed. The most important evidence was that the main culprit, the driver, confessed to having a love affair with the wife, and that the crime was instigated by her. This improper secret relationship began last July. The plaintiff had once fired the driver, but rehired him at his wife's request, who said their son liked the driver.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Name Anecdotes: Cheng and Qing <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shi… Where is he going?</p>
<p>Fang Huan… Just returning.</p>
<p>The explanation of the name of the New Literature scholar Hu Shi is "Where is he going?" in the national language. The meaning of the name of the Old Literature scholar Fang Huan is "Just returning" in the vernacular. I remember one day, a certain politician hosted a banquet to which both Hu and Fang were invited. They both arrived and then left one after the other. During the banquet, a certain issue was being discussed, and they wanted to ask Hu and Fang for their opinions. Someone asked, "Hu Shi, Hu Shi (Where is he going?). Fang Huan, Hu Shi (Where is he going?)." The host replied, "Hu Shi does not know where he is going. Fang Huan is just returning." The guests burst into laughter. Thus, Hu Shi and Fang Huan became a popular anecdote.</p>
<p>The verdict in the case was recently delivered. The judge's verdict was over fifty pages long, not only presenting concrete legal evidence, but also determining from the perspectives of reason and emotion that the wife had committed the act of murdering her husband. (1) The wife hid in the bathroom when she heard her husband calling for help and did not come out to assist. (2) When she saw her husband covered in blood, she did not show any shock or grief, but offered indifferent ridicule, advising her husband to disengage from political affairs. (3) Her son accompanied her husband to the hospital, but she did not go with them. All these circumstances seem unreasonable between a loving couple. It is truly perplexing. If she were not involved in plotting to harm her husband, she would never have shown such indifference to this tragedy. Therefore, the merciless law sentenced the wife to twelve years in prison. The verdict is finalized, and the ironclad case is difficult to overturn.</p>
<p>However, the wife remains very calm. After the verdict was announced, she prepared to appeal to the higher court and told reporters that her conscience was pure and untainted. The lower court may have made a mistake. The higher court has many judges reviewing the case. If there is still justice in the world, she will surely be declared innocent. Her words were so composed, truly befitting a socialite.</p>
<p>As for the plaintiff's attitude towards his wife, he initially stated in court that they were very affectionate and there were no quarrels or animosity. He did not believe that his wife was capable of such cruel actions. However, after the detectives found various pieces of evidence, he agreed to file a public lawsuit. His purpose was also to use the law to silence rumors. Unexpectedly, the case was ultimately established as the crime of murdering her husband. From now on, it is necessary to wait for the verdict of the High Court to determine the outcome. However, that disaster can arise from within the family, and it can be seen that the way of husband and wife is bitter.</p>

<p>Whenever we read Wang Bo's Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng, we cannot help but imagine its prosperity and grandeur in those days. A guest who has recently returned from Hongdu described the recent situation in Nanchang. Here is a record of it for the readers. The rapid advancement of commerce in Jiangxi Province has been troubled by the Communists in recent years. Capitalists in the interior have brought their wealth to the province, resulting in a sudden increase in population and a boom in commerce. Businesses compete to be the most distinctive to attract customers. Glass windows and storefront decorations can be compared to those in Wuhan, especially on Desheng and Zhongshan Roads, which are the busiest. However, rice prices are very high, costing about eighteen yuan per dan (unit of weight). This is because the rice-producing areas of Ganzhou and Ji'an are facing banditry, making transportation difficult and causing a shortage of supply.</p>
<p>The roads are wide and the road administration is extremely meticulous. In addition to the ring road around the city, there are Zhongshan and Desheng Roads. Zhongshan Road is eighty zhang (unit of length) wide and runs from Baihua Islet to the riverside. Desheng Road connects Desheng Gate with Zhongshan Road and is sixty zhang wide. It is currently under construction and not yet completed. Both sides are planted with roadside trees. In the future, when the green leaves provide shade, pedestrians will all be surrounded by greenery.</p>
<p>Transportation is convenient with the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, which takes only four hours by express train to reach Nanchang. There are public buses on the Nanchang-Zhangshu section. By waterway, it goes east through Hekou and Guangxin to Zhejiang, and south through Ganzhou to Fujian.</p>
<p>The newspaper situation is also very developed. There are the Republic Daily, Nanchang News, Industrial and Commercial News, and Commercial News.</p>

<p>The reporter stayed in Osaka for less than a day before hurrying to Tokyo. Zeng Junyanhua rushed back to Kobe to handle welcoming the Chinese athletes to the East. He was unable to see the sights of Osaka. He only visited the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. Later, although he intended to revisit after the Far Eastern Games, he was ultimately unable to fulfill his wish. He still feels regret to this day. Fortunately, he met Mr. Ruan Weicun, a reporter for our newspaper stationed in Osaka, who described the situation in Osaka in great detail. He was even clearer about the current situation of the overseas Chinese. Most of what is described in this article is from Mr. Ruan. Osaka has a long history. It was first called Daeho. During the reign of Emperor Ojin (about two thousand years ago), it was renamed Takatsu and a castle was built. In the early Meiji era, Takatsu was renamed Osaka Prefecture. Later, a city was established. After the Meiji Restoration, the port was opened. Osaka Prefecture is divided into three cities: Osaka City, Amagasaki City, and Sakai City. Osaka City is further divided into thirteen wards, each with a city office. Osaka Prefecture has a circumference of about two hundred and forty Chinese miles. Osaka's industry and commerce occupy a very important position in the world. Six or seven out of ten Japanese goods seen in the world market are produced in Osaka. The main exports are cotton yarn and cotton cloth, with an annual export value of about four or five hundred million Japanese yen. Osaka has three commodity exchanges, which are the source of cotton yarn and cotton prices in East Asia. In addition, there are various factories, including five shipyards, all of which can build giant ships of 10,000 tons or more. There are many spinning mills, the largest of which is Kanebo. There are more than two hundred banks with capital of several million yen. In terms of shipping, Osaka is the center of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha. The initial capital was only 100 million yuan, which was founded in the same year as our China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. However, due to the development of business over the years, its current strength is ten times greater than that of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. There are a total of 180 giant ships with a total deadweight of more than 400,000 tons. The shipping routes cover the globe. The most famous attractions in Osaka are Tennoji Temple, Takarazuka, Minoo, Hamadera, Obhama, and Sumiyoshi Park. Another thing that is worth paying attention to is that there is a very large arsenal in Osaka Prefecture. It was founded in the early Meiji era and greatly expanded after the Russo-Japanese War. There are now more than 20,000 workers manufacturing the latest products, which can compete with major factories around the world. To this day, they are still working day and night. Inside Osaka Castle, ammunition depots are everywhere. The richness of the storage can be imagined. The Japanese plan is far-reaching and the intention is deep, which is enough to get a glimpse of it. In terms of military preparations, the 4th Division of the Army is stationed in Osaka, plus a regiment of military police. This is the peacetime military strength. In the event of an emergency, a total of 200,000 people can be mobilized, including 150,000 Osaka reservists (i.e., retired conscripts) and youth groups.</p>
<p>The Republic Daily is run by the Party Headquarters and has the widest circulation. The evening paper is the Jiangxi Evening News, which appears after 5 p.m.</p>
<p>The entertainment for the masses includes the Xinxing Stage, located in Zhonggulou. Men and women perform together. In addition to traditional operas, they also perform Shanghai-style serial new plays to attract audiences. The lowest price is twenty cents. There are two cinemas, Lequn and Jiangxi, which both screen domestic films. There is also the Xiansheng Amusement Park, which opened on the fourth of last month. The building has four floors, with various performances from the north and south. It is like the Great World and New World in Shanghai. In addition to the entrance fee, tourists must also pay ten copper coins for education. The enthusiasm of the people of Jiangxi for education is evident.</p>
<p>The construction of parks: Baihua Islet lacks the charm of Shaolin Gully, only decorated with artificial hills. Usually, light boats meander in the islet, but in the summer the water dries up. It has now been rebuilt as Zhongshan Park, carefully managed, and manufactured artificially. Even in the long summer, it makes green water into channels to rival the West Lake.</p>
<p>The charming road names: In addition to Baihua Islet, the fragrant and pleasing road names include Cuihua Street and Qiaobu Street. Cuihua Street has many jewelry stores, and Qiaobu Street has many summer cloth shops.</p>
<p>The division of prostitutes: Prostitutes are divided into two factions, the local gang and the Yangzhou gang. Most of them gather in the Yangjiangjun Alley area. They have cut hair and wear boots, dressed fashionably. Official prostitutes are mostly found in Wutongshu and other places. Locals call them MISS, but I don't know what it means. The decay of historical sites: The Pavilion of Prince Teng was completely destroyed by fire due to lack of fire prevention. Although it was rebuilt on the original site, it was done hastily and failed to reach even one ten-thousandth of its former glory. It is now occupied by the Water Police Bureau, refusing tourists. The flying pavilions and flowing vermilion of that year have all turned to ashes. Lingering over the scenic spots, one cannot help but sigh.</p>

<p>(Unfinished) Tokyo's Water and Sewer Facilities: Water is an essential element for human life, and is very important for residents' drinking water, municipal fire prevention, and rural operations. Japan is an island nation surrounded by water. The construction and management of water and sewer facilities has been ongoing for over three hundred years without stopping. As of the end of December of Showa 3, the number of water supply households in the city has reached 338,769, and the water supply population has reached 2,070,505 people. The average total water supply per year has reached 138,118,191 cubic meters.</p>
<p>(1) Water Supply Facilities: The origins of the water supply facilities began with the diversion of the clear spring of Inokashira outside the city by Okubo Shusui, a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu. It was gradually improved by Ietsuna, the fourth shogun, and Qingyouwei, and gradually became complete. Currently, the water source for the water supply is the Tama River basin. Regarding the development near the water source, water quality deterioration, and prevention of unclean objects, several facilities such as the Mikawashima Sewage Treatment Plant and the Garbage Disposal Plant have been established. There are also detailed equipment for testing drinking water, preventing epidemics, and extinguishing fires. Such as the adjustment of reservoirs, the construction of all water channels into culverts and tunnels to prevent evaporation or leakage, and the distribution of water pumps in the city. Everything is well organized and orderly. Currently, the average daily water supply in the city is 377,372 cubic meters. The maximum daily water supply is 459,160 cubic meters. The minimum daily water supply is 279,411 cubic meters. The average water supply per person per day is approximately 186 cubic feet. The cost of facilities up to the first year of Showa was more than 35.5 million yuan. The rapid construction work after the reconstruction cost 5.13 million yuan. According to the complete water supply expansion plan set thereafter, the total budget required is approximately 67 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Sewer Facilities: Sewer facilities are extremely important for public health and hygiene, and they are most closely related to the facilities of the water supply. Since the basic sewer improvement design in the 41st year of Meiji, the first phase of construction began in the Asakusa area of Shitaya Ward in the 44th year of Meiji. In the 5th year of Taisho, due to the disaster of rainwater flooding, the second phase of construction was extended to Kyobashi, Nihonbashi, Marukomachi, and Shiba Ward in the 9th year of Taisho, in the central area of the city. The third phase of construction was the radical advancement of reconstruction after the Great Earthquake. The sewer facilities of the entire city began to be brilliantly prepared. According to statistics, the sewer system in Tokyo is divided into three areas. (1) Shiba Ward, Asabu, Akasaka, Marukomachi, Yotsuya, Ushigome, Koishikawa, Nihonbashi, the eight wards, as well as most of Hongo, Kanda, and Kyobashi, and part of Shitaya. (2) All of Asakusa Ward, most of Shitaya, Kanda, and Hongo. (3) All of Honjo, Fukagawa, and other wards, and Tsukishima in Kyobashi. The above-mentioned three areas of the sewer system each have an area, and each has a pump station and a disposal plant. After the reporter finished visiting the sewer facilities in various places that day, it was still early. I remembered that my Japanese friend, Mr. Miyazaki Ryusuke (leader of the Japanese Social Democratic Party), had come to China in the summer of the year of Jiji to participate in the memorial ceremony for Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He lived in Takadanobaba outside Tokyo, which can be reached directly by tram. Therefore, I went to visit him with Mr. Uchida Takeo and Ms. Du Huairong. He and Mrs. Byakuren came out to meet us and received us warmly. He also presented us with a calligraphy with the inscription "Popular Autonomy" and a recent photo. He also wrote "The First River of People's Governance." Ms. Huairong also wrote "Sino-Japanese Friendship" to present to Mrs. Byakuren. In a reunion in a foreign land, the feelings of old friends are strong. Later, Miyazaki sent a half-length photograph as a reward by post. He also gave two quatrains. The thick gift is given to both beauties. The gracefulness is clear and beautiful. Bringing it back is like a thousand gold treasures. This is something that cannot be done without affection. I want to comfort Mr. Kekaso. I will send a small photo in the mail. I know that the shape is ugly and ashamed to exchange it. Stay for him and wait for the snow swan.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Financial Market: Gold Market Turns Stable <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Today, swap bulls are posting</p>
<p>Guanggang shorts are preparing to liquidate</p>
<p>No major changes in the swap market: Yesterday's gold price situation was peaceful. The front market rose only four liang. The after-market also only rose or fell by three liang. The range was only two liang. The swap market was initially unchanged. The foreign exchange market was stable. There were few bank transactions. Ticket trading by various firms was also not high. Speculative large households are watching. Such as Da De Cheng, Yuan Xing Yong, Yong Feng, Bing Xing, etc., all bought in. Wan Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Chang, etc., all sold out. Since the morning market long strips were slightly longer, I did not think that I was moved. And the buyers seemed to be strong, but there were one or two liang advances and retreats from time to time. After the firm plan reached over ninety-eight liang, the sellers suddenly became active. The exchange rate also slightly shrank, helping the market to decline, so it fell by more than three liang. After the afternoon, it turned stable because the short side slightly resisted and people's hearts improved. However, transactions between peers became more and more indifferent, and the price fluctuated around ninety-six liang. Finally, it was hyped up to ninety-eight liang. As for today (16th) swaps, as usual, it will open one hour earlier at eight o'clock. Approximately long posting is due to cash stagnation. Yesterday, the large strip of silver was 1/16 longer, and the silver price was 1/8 higher.</p>
<p>Initially high, then returned four liang fluctuations: The opening price of gold in August was five hundred and ninety-six liang and seven qian, an increase of eight qian. This was due to the activity of buyers. The gross market was roughly one or two liang twists and turns, from ninety-six liang and six qian to eight qian zero households sold out. It was then suppressed to ninety-six liang and two qian. When the shilling opened, it was ninety-seven liang and two or three qian. The listed price did not change, but internally it was flat. Banks conducted a back-to-back transaction of US$37 for August US dollars. At the time, the price was reduced by several qian. At 10 o'clock, the bank absorbed forward British gold at 6.5 pence, the recent 6.1875 pence, and Yuan Chengyong and others bought in, so the increase was two liang. At 10:15, it was 98 liang and 7 qian. After entering, the sellers became prosperous. The exchange rate seemed to be loose, and the transaction was not frequent. It has gone downstream by three liang. Until 11:20, it dropped to ninety-five liang and three or four qian. After a while, it added about two liang, which was six liang and two or three qian, but the sellers were tireless, so the price could not stand. At noon it was ninety-four liang and eight qian. The closing price was ninety-five liang and three qian. The opening price was still six hundred and fifty-seven liang, a compression of sixty liang to sixty-one or two liang.</p>
<p>Short positions filled in and rebounded by two or nine liang. The opening price in the after-market was ninety-four liang and seven qian, and then rebounded by more than one liang, for a total of ninety-six liang and a half. It was due to the reduction of the Indian exchange rate by three or four ounces. After that, Yuan Chengyong, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. all had sales, so it fell to five liang and nine qian. At 2:30, the bank absorbed US$37.125 in August US dollars and 1.3 qian and 3.5 fen in Japanese gold, so it rose to six liang and seven qian. At 3 o'clock, it retreated by seven or eight qian, for a total of about six liang. The market was quite flat, only slightly fluctuating. After that, August British gold was offered by Hua Bi at 6.25 pence, so the gold price was ninety-six liang and two or three qian. After 4 o'clock, there was a sudden good sign, because the general small household shorts were filling in one after another, and today's swaps should be smoothed out. At 4:30, the closing price was five hundred and ninety-seven liang and eight qian, an increase of one liang and nine qian compared with the day before. The maximum price of the day was ninety-eight liang and seven qian, and the minimum price was ninety-four liang and six qian, a difference of four liang and one qian. The opening price was compressed by sixty-one or two liang to fifty-nine liang, and the registration was ninety-three liang to ninety-five liang. The makeup price was ninety-three liang in the morning and ninety-six liang in the afternoon. The item opened at six liang and six qian in the morning, and closed at five liang at noon. The afternoon closed at five liang and opened at eight liang.</p>
<p>Guangbang's Dalian speculation desire fades: The transactions of various firms are: Da De Cheng, Yong Feng, Yuan Xing Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Yu Da, Bing Xing are all buying in. Yuan Chengyong, Zhi Feng Yong, and Heng Xing have inflows and outflows from time to time. Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Chang, Kun He, Wan Xing, Yuan Heng, etc. all have sales. In the afternoon, Fu Chang and Shunli slightly bought in. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, and retail households all sold out slightly. After the scattered shorts were filled in again. Dalian's trading was sluggish. More than 100 strips were bought in the front market, and more than 300 strips were sold out. In the afternoon, more than 100 strips were bought in, and sellers were lacking. Guangbang also remained on the sidelines. It is said that the shorts in this swap will not fall and are preparing to liquidate.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Price of Silver Increased to 7 Fen 3 Li <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The situation is urgent, and the Shanghai silver dollar followed by increasing 2 li</p>
<p>Market Overview: This time, the rise in the exchange rate of silver for silver dollars [洋厘, a commission or exchange fee], has been gradually increasing. It has been a long and intense process, repeatedly setting new peaks for this year. Yesterday's situation was even more tense, and people became more anxious. Generally, those who have large amounts of silver dollars are reluctant to sell them easily, keeping the price high and watching the situation. In addition, the current demand is high, and purchases are inevitable. Therefore, people compete with each other, and the price suddenly rises sharply, making it unstoppable. There seems to be no room for turning back, and the rise is like ascending straight to the heavens.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates (Silver Dollar Exchange): The morning rate was 7 qian 2 fen 9 li, a sharp increase of 2 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day's morning rate. It was also better than the previous noon's peak price by 1 li and a half. The atmosphere was more elevated at noon, with the listed price reaching 7 qian 3 fen 1 li and a half. Although the closing price was strongly supported, the result was 7 qian 3 fen, and the upward trend is feared to be difficult to stop for a while. (Silver Exchange): The morning rate for transfer accounts was 9 fen, and the noon rate for silver exchange was 8 fen. There was no drastic change in the silver market, and the situation was very stable. The premium for silver was 14 fen. The bank's listed prices remained unchanged. Auxiliary Currency Market: The morning rate for Jiangnan small silver dollars was 6 qian 2 fen, and the noon rate was 6 qian 3 fen 1 li, slightly higher than the previous day by 1 li. Transactions were made, with only 4,000 jiao of Guangdong small silver dollars in the afternoon. The morning rate was 6 qian 1 fen 5 li, and the noon rate was 6 qian 1 fen 5 li and a half, also better than the previous day's noon rate by 2 li. Transactions were made, with 115,000 jiao in the morning and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon. It is found that the rise in this auxiliary currency is entirely due to the surge in the exchange rate of silver dollars. In reality, it is an excessive increase during a time of no inflation. The market price of copper coins remained the same, still at 387,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Although the situation of bank receipts and disbursements was slightly worse than yesterday, it was still better than normal. Chinese merchants received 2.67 million in checks, foreign merchants received more than 2.1 million, special items were more than 700,000 in advances, and various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items received more than 9.67 million. 800,000 entered the warehouse, and 600,000 left the warehouse. Japanese banks received more than 4.2 million in various items, with 600,000 entering the warehouse. The receipts and disbursements of Qianzhuang and silver public orders were compared to the period, totaling a huge 51.1 million. More than 5.3 million was received for premium accounts, and more than 1.4 million was received for remittances from various routes. Several tens of thousands were received in cash. (Silver Dollar Funds): The transactions made for foreign exchange transfers were 1.55 million in the morning and 1.246 million in the afternoon.

Bank transactions were 530,000 for interbank trading in the morning and 330,000 in the afternoon. The receipts and disbursements of foreign accounts between various banks were more than 2.5 million, and the inflow and outflow of banknotes were more than 2 million. The receipts and disbursements of Qianzhuang foreign public orders were also compared to the period at a rate of 15 to 1 and were numerous, totaling more than 8.4 million. More than 2.7 million was received for foreign premium accounts, and more than 3.3 million was borrowed in foreign currency. Currently, the exchange rate of silver dollars is rising, and foreign exchange transactions are very busy, resulting in more inflows and outflows. Small Qianzhuang transactions totaled more than 500,000 in banknote trading and exchange, while sales of new currency exchange premiums and the like even exceeded 1 million.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Main Reason for the Sudden Rise in the Exchange Rate of Silver Dollars <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Various Ports in Guangdong and Southern China are Searching for Cash in Shanghai</p>
<p>Another 4 Million Was Shipped Out Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sudden rise in the exchange rate of silver dollars in Shanghai was unclear to many outsiders. After an investigation by reporters, it was found that after the financial crisis in Chaozhou currency in Guangzhou, the market in that port was panicked. Yesterday, a large amount of cash was purchased in Shanghai, and over 1 million in cash was shipped out. Hong Kong also shipped out several hundred thousand yesterday, and Shantou purchased and transported 300,000 to 400,000. As for Guangzhou, 2.56 million to 600,000 was shipped out yesterday. In total, more than 4 million in silver dollars were taken from Shanghai by various ports yesterday.</p>
<p>The Rising Trend of Securities and Bond Prices Strengthens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot trading in the local securities market was increasingly sparse. The futures market was slightly better, opening at several hundred and forty thousand in the morning and only one transaction in the afternoon, with a total transaction volume of approximately 5.34 million yuan. Although the current situation still lacks new developments, the market sentiment is good, and buying interest has turned strong. The bond prices are steadily firm, and the trend is very consistent. Compared to the previous day, they all continued to rise, with customs futures rising nearly 2.34 jiao being the largest. Post-reorganization and demobilization in July all rose 1.7 jiao, and others also rose about 1 yuan. However, the continued stability, and there was no change in the seven-year 96.</p>

<p>The Cotton Yarn Market is Weakened by Overseas News</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly weak, and the situation is softening, mainly because the overseas cotton yarn market is uniformly trending downward. The sales of existing yarn are also sluggish, and all gangs [帮, merchant groups] lack a sense of excitement, so most people are bearish. However, the factories are still unwilling to relax, and there are many who are turning to scalping. But judging from the general trend, it is difficult to rise sharply, and it is not easy to fall sharply for the time being. Therefore, the current situation is still a spiral one.</p>
<p>The RMB Standard [人標, a type of cotton yarn] Falls Back: The RMB Standard opened with a slight weakness in American cotton, and trading in the market was still sluggish. Da Feng made a few purchases, with fluctuations of only 1 or 2 qian. In the 2nd and 3rd rounds [盤, trading sessions], the prices of 3rd grade yarn fell, with each month falling 1, 2, or 4 qian. In the afternoon, due to poor spot sales, the price of 3rd grade yarn fell again by 2 or 3 yuan, and the market was quite loose, with each month falling 2, 3, 4, or 5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 3,750 bales. It was found that the sellers were Da Fu, Yu Da, Ji Feng, and Tian Long, with 150 to 350 bales each. The buyers were Da Feng, Heng Chang, Yi Long, and Li Chang, with 200 to 350 bales each. The closing prices of the RMB Standard are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>RMB Standard, Closing Price Fluctuation, Account Number</p>

<p>July 1556 Down 1 17150 November 1257 430700</p>
<p>August 1558 Up 5 25300 December 1253 712450</p>
<p>September 1556 Up 5 26900</p>
<p>Current Demand Remains Sluggish: The sales of existing yarn remain flat. The gangs only purchased 935 bales. Only the fellow traders are uniquely strong, with 3,030 bales. The market is average. The customer route of Sichuan Gang is the largest, with 320 bales. In addition, Tianjin imported 315 bales, Guangdong imported 160 bales, Shantou imported 30 bales, Zhenjiang imported 20 bales, and miscellaneous gangs imported 60 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market has shown signs of weakness again, mainly because the overseas cotton market is not doing well, so people's hearts are uncertain. Fluctuations of rising and falling are happening. The August contracts have some buyers who are determined and seem to be trying to squeeze the market. However, each factory has already absorbed a lot of existing cotton and Indian cotton, and there is no demand at all. The Han Standard opened at a lower price than the afternoon opening, with a weak market and prices decreasing from 5 fen to 1.5 qian per share. In August, only Tai Hing purchased more than 3,000 dan. It was found that Tai Hing purchased the most, with 3,300 dan. Da Chang, Cheng Yi, Cheng Tian, Chang Li, and Yu Da purchased from 500 dan to 1,900 dan. Heng Da sold the most, with 2,000 dan. Shen Chang, Tong Xing, Xin Cheng, and Da Feng sold from 1,000 dan to 2,800 dan. The total daily transaction volume was 22,000 dan. The closing price of the standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Amount of Yarn Stored in This Port Increases <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Exceeding the Record of 120,000 Bales</p>
<p>The amount of yarn stored in this port has exceeded the record of 120,000 bales. This is because the sales of existing yarn are relatively sluggish, and each factory has increased the number of yarn spindles after the booming business last year, resulting in a higher production rate. At the end of June, the Hua Ying factory and yarn shops stored 113,942 bales, an increase of 34,829 bales compared to May. Japanese factories stored 11,225 bales, an increase of 8,260 bales compared to May. The number of yarn stored in the most recent months is listed below:</p>

<p>Due to Rain, the Rice Market is Extremely Depressed</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to rain, no ships arrived in Zhabei, and transactions in this street were also suspended due to rain. Although there was a price discussion at noon at Bian Yuan River, there was no trading because it was difficult to open the measuring container. The large stocks were still around 19.5 yuan. Northern japonica rice in these one or two markets will be at rock bottom. The Huangdu cargo ships, which have been abandoned for a long time, will soon be opened and sold in Shanghai because they are useless to hold onto. However, the dispute between the Rice Merchants Association and the Rice Shops Association, as well as the shortage of rising and falling goods, was discussed in an important meeting last night, but there was no solution. The Rice Merchants Association decided that it would be difficult to pay in advance for the goods after the assessment of the measuring container, so there are still difficulties in assessing the rising and falling prices of japonica and indica rice in the future. The whole day's situation here was extremely lonely. There is no source of Baijing at the river under the South of Shanghai, and the Sutong goods are gradually becoming bland, still priced at 21 yuan. This kind of market is like a stereotyped article, and the yin and yang changes are still not developing. The association's transactions are extremely small, almost resembling a standstill. Although the warehouses lack storage, the atmosphere in the market is not panicked. Moreover, this port still has more than 30,000 stones of stockpiled japonica rice, and the authorities have completed the registration. Of course, the necessary sanctions will be adopted, so although no goods have arrived from the north and south recently, the large stocks are instead showing sluggishness.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Another Message of Optimism About Rice Prices <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>This year, the harvest in the Liyang area is very good, and the early sharp rice will be available next month. In the past two days, Xixin reported that Liyang rice merchants had already been trying to sell rice in Xixin, and the quoted price was 4.5 yuan. This kind of market price is about 13.5 yuan in Shanghai, and the number of tons sold is irrelevant. It is currently being negotiated, so the future of the rice market is not pessimistic. In addition, the early rice harvest in the Wuhu area is also abundant, and according to news from that place, the new rice will be available soon. Therefore, foreign rice in Wuhu has recently been transferred to neighboring counties, so the price of foreign rice may have to decline after the stagnation in the consumption in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sales of Foreign Rice are Dull, Continuing to Decrease by Two or Three Jiao <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was even softer due to the sluggishness of goods sold to customers. Although more than 10,000 bales were exchanged on the market, they were not really going anywhere. Only 5,000 to 6,000 bales were sold to the inland areas and retail households in this street. Therefore, the market price has fallen by 1 to 3 jiao. The sale of 1st grade Saigon was 18 yuan, 2 jiao, 8 fen to 1 jiao, 2 fen. 2nd grade was 15 yuan, 9 jiao, 7 fen. Small Twisted was 16 yuan, 5 jiao, 2 fen to 2 jiao. Large Twisted was 15 yuan, 3 jiao to 14 yuan, 8 jiao. Mindang was 16 yuan, 4 jiao, 5 fen. Qialadi Rough was 15 yuan. Small Twisted Rough Rice was 14 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Flour Market is Currently Good, Future is Flat <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of being firm in the near months and flat in the distant months. Due to the limited storage capacity of the factory in the current month, the sporadic sales venues are still continuing. (It is said that the price of spot flour in Tianjin has opened to 4 yuan and 5 fen.) If this route can be installed in the future, then the sales can be expected to be active. Therefore, the market sentiment is very strong, and speculators are scrambling to cover their positions. Although the quotation for foreign wheat has risen by 2 to 3 jiao in the distant months, most people believe that the foreign wheat market is still oversupplied, or foreign wheat may come to China. Therefore, the market sentiment has not been boosted, and buyers are very quiet. As a result, the prices for the current and next months have risen by 3 fen compared to the previous day. The prices for September and November have risen by 5 li, the price for October has risen by 2.5 li, and the price for December has not changed.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Wheat Market Falls and Rises Again <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market generally showed a spiral pattern. Initially, because the inland gangs were about to enter the market for early rice, both near-term and distant-term prices were going down step by step, so the market once showed weakness. (It is said that the price of Suzhou special high wheat opened at 9 yuan, 3 jiao, and a half, which is already cheaper by 1 or 2 jiao compared to the previous price.) Later, due to the large-scale purchases by local merchants and hoarders, the market turned upward again. If the sales of flour become active, the wheat market should temporarily look promising. As a result, the prices for the current month to November remained unchanged, and the price for December was better by 1 fen. The prices of existing wheat, such as Shandong Chen Bai Wheat, Huang Qiao, Bianjiang, and Yaowan Wheat, were similar to the previous day because the factories rarely showed interest in purchasing and the merchants were unwilling to cut prices cheaply, so the transactions were very quiet. The entire market only did more than 2,000 bales.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Increase Steadily</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market reported that the current price of Cuban raw sugar was 1.25, down 0.0625 from the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures in September was 1.25, down 3 fen. The price in December was 1.35, down 2 fen. The price in March next year was 1.43, down 3 fen. The price in May was 1.51, also down 2 fen. The current price of Javanese sugar was 8.875, up 0.125 from the previous price. The price of sugar futures in August was 8.50, and the price in September was 8.375, with no increase or decrease. The atmosphere of the raw and white sugar market of the association was very strong, and the price quoted by the dealers was 7 taels and 9 qian, but the buyers' intention to purchase was very weak, resulting in a stalemate. As a result, the price in the later market was 7 taels and 8 qian and a half, with a slight transaction. However, there were still few dealers, and the market was firm and bullish. The prices of Japanese sugar YRO mark were 7 taels, 9 qian, 2 fen, and a half, YT mark was 8 taels, 7 fen, and a half, and YP mark was 8 taels, 2 qian, 7 fen, and a half to 8 taels, 3 qian. There were not many transactions, and the market was not unusual. A certain number of Dutch sugar was dumped for sale, with the price of the number 10 Dutch red sugar being 4 yuan, 9 jiao, and a half, according to the new regulations. The major merchants were not interested. The opening price of raw and white sugar from the Liji Foreign Company was 6 yuan in Dutch currency, and a telegram has been sent. The factory must reply to confirm it.</p>
<p>More than 1,600 Pieces of New Guangdong Branches of North-South Goods are Opened</p>
<p>The second batch of new Guangdong branches was transported by the Lin'an and other ships the day before yesterday, totaling 1,600 pieces. Yesterday, samples were seen and opened by various merchants in the north and south markets in full quantity. The price of the Shangpai Shuidong branch was 13 taels and a half, the Shangjian Zhuang branch was 10 taels, the Shangzhuang Haikou branch was 7 taels and a half, and the prices of the inferior ones were reduced by about 2 taels. The market price was stable at 14 taels, 11 taels, and 8 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Factories Plan to Suspend Work During the Summer Vacation</p>
<p>Every year, during the hot summer months, the silk factories in this port usually reduce working hours to half-time or three-quarters (i.e., one-third) to allow for rest. Recently, overseas silk weaving factories have been trying to reduce costs due to economic reasons, mixing in rayon, which has greatly reduced the demand for raw silk. In addition, the price of Japanese silk has been falling, and the price of Chinese silk is relatively high due to high costs, so European and American silk merchants have no appetite for it. The slump in silk sales has reached an extreme point. The silk factories are now planning to suspend work temporarily during the period of reduced working hours during the summer vacation in order to save expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Qining Fragrant Tea is Launched for Sale in England <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the Russian Aid Association opened black tea, the English merchants have seen the wide sales of Qining fragrant tea and the Russian tea, as well as the low tea price. Their interest has become more active. Yesterday, Tianyu Foreign Company in the market took the lead in purchasing more than 5,000 boxes. Other companies are also starting to take action, and the market is quite lively. The trading of green tea such as needle eyebrow and beautiful eyebrow is still not lonely. However, the very important Zhenmei tea is still being raised up and down. There is not much transaction for Qining black tea, and the market situation is still difficult to be considered optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shexian Maocha Shops Have a Healthy Appetite <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Shexian is an important tea-producing area in Huizhou. This year, the number of tea shops in various villages that run foreign shops has decreased compared to the old days, and the number of shops that run shops is quite enthusiastic. Recently, due to the poor news from the tea market in Shanghai, the spring tea in Shantu has been converted into bamboo baskets and sold to Shanghai and Tianjin. The market price of Maofeng is 130 yuan per dan, and the price of ordinary goods is more than 50 yuan. The tea stored in the market is not worried about being stagnant because the shops have a very large appetite.</p>
<p>Hardware: Small Nails are Out of Stock</p>
<p>Small foreign nails from 3 fen to 6 fen have been scarce for a long time, and the accumulation is shallow. The trend has long been promising, but it is still peaceful due to the lack of transactions. In recent days, due to the surge in market sentiment, those who hold spot goods have the idea of selling them at a good price, so buyers are rising up, and there is a general overview that the bottom goods have been bought out. The market is very bullish. The current market price is 12 taels for 3 fen, 10 taels and 7 qian and a half for 4 fen, 10 taels for 5 fen, and 9 taels and 5 qian for 6 fen.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Yesterday's Hurricane Has Passed <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>But There is a New Hurricane</p>
<p>May Visit a Second Time</p>
<p>The various circumstances of the hurricane that passed through this port the day before yesterday have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the wind force had decreased yesterday, and the weather turned sunny in the afternoon. However, the customs flagpole at Lujiazui in Pudong received a report from the observatory stating that the hurricane had already passed through Zhenjiang to the north of the Yangtze River, traveling north along the 120th meridian and reaching the 33rd parallel, causing havoc in the Jiangbei inland area. There was no danger to this port or the sea surface. Therefore, at approximately 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the black warning ball that had been hoisted was lowered. Consequently, the ocean liners that had been suspended for a day had also successively departed and exited yesterday. However, at 4:00 p.m., the Yangjingbang Observatory received a report from the Xujiahui headquarters stating that another hurricane had occurred in the east of the northern Philippine Islands in the Pacific Ocean, heading west-northward across the ocean. If it does not change direction, it will land in Fujian after passing south of Taiwan. However, the wind direction is uncertain. If it turns into a true northwest wind over the Taiwan Strait, then this port will have a second hurricane visiting it within a few days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Temporary Prevention and Treatment Office for Cholera, established in Shanghai by the Ministry of Health of the National Government, received a bulletin from the Eastern Health Bureau on the 10th of this month stating that 81 cases of cholera had occurred in Calcutta, India, with 53 deaths; 7 cases in Saigon, with 4 deaths; and 99 cases in Cebu Island, Philippines, with 50 deaths. The epidemic is spreading widely in other parts of the Philippines as well. The health authorities of this port and other ports in China are now quite worried about the spread of the epidemic in the Philippines. However, as far as Shanghai is concerned, bacteriological tests have been conducted repeatedly by Chinese and Concession health officials, and no true cholera bacteria have been found to date.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Orders the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Encourage the Purchase and Use of Domestically Produced Matches <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce instructed the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce as follows: "In order to issue an order, we have investigated that matches are a daily necessity, and the annual consumption is enormous. This business has always been controlled by foreign merchants. In recent years, domestic manufacturers have established factories and are determined to operate. Sales have gradually expanded, and the effect of saving leakage has been considerable. Recently, various parties have listed the situations of foreign merchants' aggression and monopoly, and have requested that measures be taken to provide relief, and that all institutions and groups in the country should uniformly purchase and use domestically produced matches in order to slightly reduce the trend of foreign match aggression. The Ministry has checked the various sections reported and found that they are true. In addition to studying fundamental relief policies to protect them, the request to widely encourage the purchase and use of domestic matches is indeed an essential plan. We hope that our people will understand this and encourage each other to maintain the dying match industry of this country. The order is hereby given to the Chamber to immediately comply with and devise means to encourage purchase and use, and to report the handling situation to the Supervisory Office at any time." It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has prepared a letter to inform the various trade associations to inform their affiliated businesses to uniformly purchase and use domestic matches after receiving this order.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Record of Sino-Egyptian Tariff Negotiations <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, Egypt has implemented tariff autonomy and announced new tariff regulations this year, to be effective in February. The tariff regulations are divided into maximum and minimum rates. Countries that have signed agreements with Egypt recognizing the new tariffs will be subject to the minimum rate; otherwise, the maximum rate will apply. There is no commercial treaty between China and Egypt, but Chinese tobacco exports to Egypt are substantial. Therefore, Egyptian tobacco merchants requested that China recognize the new Egyptian tariffs to reduce the tax rate. The Chinese Legation in London followed this approach, negotiating with Egypt using an "exchange of notes" format, with both parties exchanging official documents to apply the lower tax rate on the principle of reciprocity. This arrangement is limited to a one-year term and will then expire. A formal commercial treaty has not yet been signed.</p>

<p>Bei Jietai, Director of the Baoshan County Finance Bureau, regarding the collection of land taxes for the 19th year of the Republic, previously requested an additional local fee of eight cents per mu of land. After approval, the order was issued to the record-keepers of each district to verify and allocate the tax silver according to the regulations, and then to calculate the equivalent amount in silver dollars. They worked overnight to create tax collection registers and send them to each counter to prepare the receipts. The procedures for starting collection have now been completed, and tax collection counters were opened yesterday. A notice was issued to all property owners in each district, requiring them to seal their payments and submit them to the counters within the deadline, paying the full amount. Furthermore, Baoshan land tax receipts have been thoroughly improved since last year. In addition to the originally allocated tax silver amount, the equivalent amount in silver dollars is added. All amounts payable by each property owner are clearly printed on the receipt, making it clear at a glance, eliminating the effort of conversion and avoiding malpractices such as surcharges. The fact that the land tax receipts include the actual amount in silver dollars was first initiated by the county finance bureau. Since the trial implementation, the results have been excellent, and the public feels very convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Municipal Party Department Holds Memorial Service for Fan and Guo Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Fan Zhengluo and Guo Qingzhao, two martyrs, had been vigorously engaged in suppressing the communists during their lifetimes, which led to the communists' hatred. They were assassinated by the communists one after the other.

Many wreaths and elegiac couplets were sent from various parties.

Guo Qingchang represented Guo's family in giving thanks.</p>
<p>Memorial Text: On this 15th day of July in the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, Supervisory Committee, and all Party members respectfully offer a sacrifice of clear wine and fragrant flowers before the spirits of Comrades Fan Zhengluo and Guo Qingzhao, saying: Alas, who can escape death? Death is sometimes heavier than Mount Tai, and sometimes lighter than a feather. Rather than following popular opinions and living to an old age, how can one compare to sacrificing oneself for the Party and the country, taking righteousness and achieving benevolence? This is the difference between a feather and Mount Tai, and this is why the deaths of the two comrades are admired and mourned by us without end. One, newly married and setting out on a long journey, did not let the feelings of family hold back the ambitions of a hero. After arriving in Shanghai for several months, he did not spare any effort to eliminate evil and punish violence. Who would have known that he would be hated by the communists and suddenly be assassinated, sacrificing himself for the sake of righteousness? That was Comrade Fan. The other, when communist heresies were rampant and ignorant workers were sometimes deceived, to prevent future troubles, especially engaged in rectifying and eliminating the red scourge, making outstanding achievements. Who would have known that he would also suddenly be assassinated, painfully becoming crippled, giving up his life for righteousness? That was Comrade Guo. Alas, the two comrades have passed away. Colleagues, who are left behind, vow to continue the fearless spirit of the two comrades, to eliminate the rebels, defend the Party and the country, realize the ideology, and save the people from fire and water, completing the unfinished aspirations of the two comrades. This is why today's memorial service is filled with weeping and sorrow, and why we use it to encourage ourselves. If the spirits of the two comrades are conscious, may they accept this humble sincerity and smile in the afterlife. Alas, may you enjoy the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Slogans (1) Continue the revolutionary spirit of the two martyrs; (2) The two martyrs sacrificed for the Party; (3) The two martyrs died for us; (4) The deaths of the two martyrs are a loss to our Party; (5) Vow to avenge the two martyrs; (6) Eliminate the Chinese Communist Party; (7) Complete the unfinished aspirations of the two martyrs; (8) The spirit of the two martyrs will never die; (9) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (10) Long live the Republic of China.</p>

They have begun fundraising separately from today and will submit the accumulated funds to the central government for transfer to the front. The full text of their instructions to various districts and unions is as follows: An order is issued for compliance. It has been found that Yan and Feng, the two rebels, have betrayed the Party and the country, and started a war against the south.

However, the post-war devastation is heartbreaking and eye-catching. Treating the wounded and saving the dying is a matter of urgency. This association believes that the brave soldiers at the front fight bravely and rush into the enemy's camp, and it is inevitable that there will be injuries from artillery fire, and the suffering and displacement of the war zone is even more heartbreaking. Therefore, it is necessary to provide condolences and comfort. A fundraising campaign is launched to help the victims. The following order is hereby issued to distribute a copy of the association's donation register, and to start widespread fundraising from today, implement it practically, and transfer it to the affiliates to comply with it in an integrated manner, in order to achieve practical results.

<h3 id="e147">Ecuadorian Overseas Chinese Support Honorary Consul, Inquiry Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Kuomintang branch in Guayaquil, Ecuador, South America, filed a case accusing Chen Xintang, Honorary Consul in the country, of 13 charges. The Ecuadorian Chinese Chamber of Commerce, considering that Consul Chen has always been admired by overseas Chinese merchants, sent a telegram to clarify the situation and express support. Details were published in this newspaper on the 14th. It has now been learned that the Overseas Chinese Promotion Association at 17 Chuanchang Road, Zhabei (moved from 478 North Sichuan Road in early June) received an express mail telegram from Gu Yuwen, President of the Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Shaozhi, Vice President (also a representative of the association in Guayaquil), requesting assistance in appealing to dispel the false accusations and seek the welfare of the overseas Chinese. The association approved this and immediately forwarded it to Hu Hanmin, a member of the Central Party Department in Nanjing, for referral to the Standing Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee for investigation. An annotation was added: "We have always known that if your committee members find any mistakes in comrades after investigation, they will often offer frank advice and guidance, hoping for correction. This kind of frank spirit is admirable. Moreover, your committee members have been abroad for many years and are very familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese and party affairs. Regarding the above-mentioned incident, we believe that you will have appropriate solutions. Our association does not seem to have to worry too much. However, we would like to ask for a reply on how to handle it, so that we can pass it on to the future. We are looking forward to it."</p>
<p>The association also received an original document from the Ecuadorian Chinese Chamber of Commerce, clarifying the Chinese Kuomintang's accusation of the Chens General Consul of thirteen. The clarification was sent to Wu Kewei, on behalf of Wei, the ambassador to Peru, who was requested to transfer it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government. The original document rebutted each of the accusations. The seventh rebuttal stated: "Original text (Honorary Consul is called Consul General in Ecuador)". Chen, was appointed by the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yan Huiqing, of our government on July 27, 1922. It was approved by the Ecuadorian government on May 8, 1924. When the current President of Ecuador took office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our National Government telegraphed Consul General Chen, instructing him to represent the National Government as a Chinese Consul and offer congratulations. This is clear evidence that the National Government recognizes Chen as the Chinese Consul in Ecuador.</p>
<h3 id="e148">French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike, Report Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Calls Union for Talks</p>
<p>Trackless Trolley Attacked Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union, in view of the repeated damage to the company's water pipes and the dispatch of armed police to protect the company's repairs by the Public Security Bureau, sent Standing Committee Member Xu Amai to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to report, stating briefly: "The workers have been on strike for a month. Twice...</p>
<p>###</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>...the Bureau has called labor and management for mediation, but the French businessman has refused to listen and has repeatedly been absent. Their attitude of contempt for Chinese officials is extremely obvious. Regarding the damage to the water pipes, it was discovered that the Public Security Bureau sent police to protect the repairs. It should be known that this measure is beneficial to citizens and maintains the water supply, but the cause of this damage is that the factory has cut off the workers' livelihood and forced them to strike. They recruited new workers who were unfamiliar with the repairs, which is their own fault. Chinese officials are so protecting French businessmen that the lives of our 700 workers will be in a desperate situation. When can the victory of the strike be expected? Please help us." Guo Yongxi of the Third Section received them, accommodated their opinions, and agreed to discuss the matter with Section Chief Zhang.</p>
<p>More than 200 workers from the union went to the Municipal Party Department yesterday morning to petition and state their case. Comrade Yang of the Civil Training Committee received the representatives, Xu Amai and others, and agreed to forward it to the various committees and promised to find a way to help.</p>
<p>The union convened a meeting of all workers at 3:00 PM to discuss the matter. Xu Amai, the chairman, reported on the petition to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department, stating briefly that the party, government, and military held a meeting and had specific measures for the labor unrest. "All the circumstances have been reported the day before yesterday. However, the victory of our strike depends on the assistance of the higher authorities, and also requires the assistance of all sectors. At the same time, it requires all workers to unite and struggle to achieve the goal of victory."</p>
<p>The union, during the strike period, was deeply afraid that a few workers would be incited by others and cause disturbances, which would not only hinder the strike but also be criticized. Therefore, it issued a notice to the workers to take special precautions and step up security to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to act. At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Cui, a representative of Hua Dong Du, a director of the French Concession, came to the union, saying that Du asked to send representatives to come. Wang Agan, Zhang Amao, Zhang Qixiang, and Chen Puwen were sent. Du reported that the four workers who were released on bail by the French police were now required by the police to return to the case for investigation. He asked the two representatives to go to the union and ask the four previously detained people to come immediately. Chen Pu'ai and Zhang Qixiang returned to the union to report, and the masses were extremely grieved. After discussion, it was decided that of the four workers, two were released and two were released by Du. The two released by Du were Liu Linsheng and Zhou Aliuli. The original people volunteered to go to be detained on the spot. The two representatives accompanied them to Du's residence. Then Du sent someone to send the workers to the French police, but the police returned the original people to Du's house shortly after.</p>
<p>Yuan Liang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, fearing that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to mix in and incite the workers today and tomorrow, specially instructed Gao, the patrol officer of the Second District, to go to the union and call several representatives to talk yesterday. The union sent Zheng Ruisheng and Li Chuanqing to go. Director Yuan instructed that he hoped that all workers would take a calm attitude and not be incited by reactionary elements taking the opportunity to mix in, resulting in accidents. Then he explained the reason for protecting the company to repair the water pipes this time, hoping that the union would not misunderstand. The two representatives returned to the union and reported to the masses, all of whom complied.</p>
<p>At 11:25 yesterday noon, a French merchant's eighteenth Route No. 165 trackless trolley passing through the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road was attacked by someone who threw a stone, damaging nine pieces of glass but not injuring anyone. By the time the French police arrived, the people had dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Labour unrest breaks out in Ewo Yarn Factory <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>According to Wen Wei Pao, the old Ewo Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road has stopped night work since last week due to the poor yarn market. It is stipulated that the original two shifts of day and night workers will take turns working every week. However, at about 5:00 yesterday morning (14th), when 1,500 workers who originally worked the night shift arrived at the factory to go to work, 150 workers who originally worked the day shift came forward to stop them, demanding a work stoppage protest, to prompt the factory to agree to the workers' demand that all 3,000 workers actually work five full days a week. After consultation between the factory manager and the workers' representatives, it was still unresolved at 11:30 in the morning, becoming a stalemate. The workers then left the factory together, and the factory was temporarily suspended. After the workers left the factory, about 100 people went east along Yangshupu Road, wanting to go to the new Ewo Factory on Weituoma Road. On the way, they arbitrarily picked up stones and threw them at several cars and one trolley car and four buses, breaking some car window glass. When they arrived in front of the new Yangshupu factory, they were blocked by Westerners inside the factory, and they took stones to throw at each other again. The patrolmen arrived and they dispersed.</p>

<p>And Soliciting User Opinions</p>
<p>The Chinese Users Union of the China Foreign Telephone Company sent a letter to each user yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir/Madam, the telegram and telephone business of our country is clearly stipulated to be state-owned. However, this time, the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation purchased the property of the China Foreign Telephone Company without the approval of our government and disregarded our national sovereignty. Although the government has repeatedly protested and the public has opposed it, the company has ignored it and is aggressively proceeding. Moreover, the company is purely for profit. Statistics show that the net profit of the business is as high as 100%, so the increase in telephone usage fees in the future will be endless, and the losses of users will inevitably be inevitable. The Ministry of Communications of the National Government of our country previously planned to recover and operate the China Foreign Telephone Company on its own due to its poor management. For the old Chinese shares, it is planned to exchange cash or convert them into new stocks at market prices after recovery, as commercial shares. For the old foreign shares, the Chinese businessmen will be allowed to recover them, or the government will buy them. For the future business prices, the prosperity of the business and the interests of the commercial shares are purely intended, which is incomparable to the mere profit-seeking of foreign businessmen. All users of China Foreign Telephone Company have suffered from the bad influence of past telephones, of course, they believe that unless the telephone business is completely recovered by the government and directly supervised by our government, it is not enough to protect national rights and seek improvement. In order to support national sovereignty and maintain the interests of users, our association has organized the Chinese Users Union of China Foreign Telephone Company. All Chinese users are members. The association is located on the third floor of Shanghai Hong Kong No. 4 and started working on July 1st to actively promote and support the government. We hope that all Chinese users will work together to advocate the purpose of supporting national rights and maintaining interests. Therefore, we have attached a copy of the association's articles of association and sent it to you, hoping that you will check and fully express your opinions, and indicate the strategy to proceed. Because the time was urgent, our association was hurriedly organized and established, and Li Zuchong, Hua Huizhong, Zhu Yinjiang, Tao Ledong, Hu Fengxiang, Wang Zhiwei, Cheng Zhusun, Jin Runxiang, Zhang Yichen, and nine others were appointed as temporary directors to take charge of the association's affairs. We should nominate and elect formally in accordance with the regulations to achieve soundness. For this reason, we also ask you to nominate three candidates for directors from among the users you know and send them to our association within three days, so that we can decide on a plan and formally elect them. Sincerely, The Chinese Users Union of China Foreign Telephone Company."</p>

<p>Jin Yuanlin Dies Suddenly from Acute Disease</p>
<p>Jin Yuanlin from Zhejiang (nickname "Little Huzhou"), who lived at a certain address on North Henan Road in the Public Concession and specialized in lending at high interest, was 37 years old. Yesterday afternoon around 6 o'clock, while holding his one or two-year-old son, he went to Chen Xiji's house at No. 4 Deshan Lane on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession to collect interest. After entering the door with the child in his arms, his face suddenly turned pale, and his body was covered in cold sweat like beads. In less than five minutes, without saying a word, he died suddenly from an acute illness. The Chen family, seeing this situation, was stunned. Later, they sent someone to notify the deceased's concubine, known as Xiao Laosi, to come. Suspecting foul play, they reported the incident to the Louza Police Station. After the head detective sent an investigator to examine the scene, it was determined that he had died from an acute illness. The head detective allowed the woman to claim the body for burial. As a result, the woman borrowed a coffin from a charity organization and hastily buried the deceased, temporarily placing him in the Huzhou Guild Hall in Zhabei, it is said.</p>

<p>Yang Linshi's Tragic Last Words</p>
<p>Yang Haiting from Anhui has been running the Yangchun Beef Noodle Restaurant at No. 359 Lane on South City Road, Guan Bridge. He had a son named Jin Biao, who was 41 years old and ran a beef stall near the restaurant. The year before last, through a matchmaker, he married a woman from Ningbo named Linshi. She was 36 years old. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was relatively harmonious. Jin Biao gave all his earnings to her for safekeeping. However, she was addicted to flower gambling and would often bet tens of taels of silver at a time. After losing all her savings, she even pawned her clothes and jewelry to continue gambling. Unexpectedly, she lost every time. Recently, she gambled away all the money her husband gave her daily. Having run out of money, she was afraid of being scolded by her husband, so she hid the truth. Around 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, Jin Biao needed to pay the beef company, and asked her for money, but she didn't respond for a long time. Suspecting something, he questioned her, and she confessed the truth. Jin Biao was extremely angry and immediately scolded her. She was already heavily in debt and now faced her husband's condemnation. Feeling resentful, she secretly went into the room, swallowed opium behind everyone's back, and lay down on the bed. Around 2 p.m., the family discovered her, seeing her face pale. Suspecting she was ill, they urgently called her awake and rushed her to the Red Cross South City Hospital for treatment. After examination, the doctor realized she had taken poison. He quickly tried to save her, but it was too late, and the poison had already taken effect. She soon died. As she was dying, she tearfully said to her husband, "Because I was addicted to flower gambling, I lost all your money, clothes, and jewelry. I have failed you, and I cannot die in peace." After saying this, she passed away. Yang immediately reported the situation to the local District One Police Station and explained the facts of his wife Linshi's life. The district chief, considering it a matter of life and death, ordered Lu Yongde, the sixteenth ward head, to report to the Shanghai Local Court for an inquest. Yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m., Prosecutor Zhao, accompanied by the coroner, arrived at the scene and confirmed that Yang Linshi had indeed died from poisoning. He ordered the family to sign a guarantee and claim the body for burial. After the inquest, he returned to the court to report.</p>

<p>Why Did Gan Dushi Die?</p>
<p>Gan Dushi, a woman living at No. 3 South Chujia Bridge in the French Concession, had been widowed for several years. She had some savings and a son who was already of age, but he was not good at making a living and seemed to have a mental disorder. Gan Dushi also had a legal wife in her hometown, who also had a son who was married. However, they were far away from Shanghai and rarely visited. In Shanghai, she and her son were able to make ends meet. In recent years, she had become addicted to flower gambling, secretly betting and losing all her savings in the past year or two. She even pawned her clothes and jewelry, seeking divine guidance and hoping for a lucky bet. Unexpectedly, she lost again, resulting in extreme financial hardship. However, she never revealed her situation outwardly, while feeling extremely anxious inside. In the end, she died suddenly at the end of last month due to anxiety. She had no possessions left behind. The legal wife and son from her hometown came to Shanghai, intending to divide her inheritance. During the initial mourning period, because not all relatives were present, the boxes were not opened. It was not until the memorial ceremony that all the relatives gathered and opened the boxes. There were no complete clothes, only two boxes of flower gambling slips and scrap paper. As a result, the legal wife and son wanted to flee. The relatives ordered them to bear the funeral expenses, shouting that it was bad luck and a jinx.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Retrial Verdict in Apprentice Dies from Kicking Case <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Six Months Imprisonment Overturned</p>
<p>Civil Portion Remains as Originally Judged</p>
<p>Hu Atong, a Shaoxing native who worked as a partner in the Wanhua Cheng Laundry opened by Zhang Binghao from Wenzhou on Rue de Sévigné in the French Concession, kicked his apprentice Liu Caidong in March of this year, causing injury. Liu Caidong died in the laundry on May 24. Afterwards, the deceased's mother Liu Meishi sued Hu in the French court for causing injury, requesting a trial and compensation for damages. After repeated interrogations, the court sentenced Hu to six months imprisonment and ordered him to pay the plaintiff 500 yuan in compensation. Hu, dissatisfied with the initial verdict, hired lawyer Gu Jirong to represent him and submitted a petition for retrial. The retrial was approved, and he was interrogated yesterday. Lawyer Gu argued on behalf of the appellant, and the plaintiff claimed that the initial court had not determined the cause of death of the deceased and rashly convicted the appellant. Although the appellant had a dispute with the deceased in March, he did not kick him in the chest, and the deceased continued to work as usual without any sign of injury until he died two months later. It was difficult to prove whether he died from the kick. Therefore, the original verdict should be overturned or the sentence reduced, and the appellant had previously agreed to pay some compensation. The laundry owner and others testified in court about the situation at the time. Judge Gong ruled to overturn the six-month imprisonment sentence of the initial verdict, stating that the civil portion of the initial verdict was reasonable and should be enforced as originally judged.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Gu Ayou Can't Forget the Widow <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Two Thefts of Photographs</p>
<p>Involving Two University Students</p>
<p>The Third Branch of the Zhenru Fourth District Security Bureau reported the day before yesterday (the 12th) that Jinan University students Li Shaobai and Zhou Chuanfeng had reported that a thief, Gu Ayou, had stolen money and items from their flat at No. 16 Lijia Ge. The police were dispatched to arrest him and brought the victim Li Xueshi to the station. Acting Director Shi questioned the plaintiff Li Shaobai, who stated that he was from Sanyuan, Shaanxi. He and Zhou rented a room at Li Xueshi's house. This morning, they suddenly saw the defendant Gu Ayou hurriedly leaving their room with a paper package. They did not know him, but his suspicious behavior indicated that he must be a thief, so they reported it to the bureau for arrest. Zhou, from Jishui, Jiangxi, 24 years old, gave a similar statement. Gu Ayou, a 43-year-old farmer from Shanghai, confessed that he had always been a bachelor. Recently, Li Xueshi's mother insisted on marrying her daughter to him. He felt sorry for the widow and paid a dowry of 100 yuan, planning to marry her next month. However, Xueshi was frivolous and had been having an affair with the university student Zhou and others. Knowing that she had changed her mind and there would be no good outcome, he was still resentful. So, this morning, he sneaked into Xueshi's bedroom and stole a photo of her as a memento. Li Xueshi, from Wuxi, 33 years old, stated that Li Shaobai and others were her tenants. Her husband had died many years ago, and she made a living by working. Unexpectedly, Gu had been trying to seduce her to marry him. She refused, and he stole her photo and fled. Li and others reported it to the police, who arrested him. The director, based on the confession, suspected that Gu Ayou's theft of Xueshi's photo was motivated by other reasons. However, since the matter was trivial, he released Gu on bail. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Gu took the opportunity to sneak into Xueshi's room again and hid her photo in his pocket. When Li and others were about to go to school, they saw Gu stealing something again and handed him over to the police, who sent him to the bureau again. During the interrogation by the director, Gu Ayou became delusional, claiming that the university student had committed adultery with his wife, which was extremely shameless, and his words were incoherent. The director, considering that Gu had repeatedly stolen Xueshi's photo and there might be other issues involved, immediately prepared a document to send Gu, Xueshi, Li Shaobai, and Zhou Chuanfeng together to the Judicial Section for review.</p>

<p>The Wen-Tai-helping sand ship Baoxing, which was loading a large batch of timber from Fuzhou to Shanghai for unloading, arrived at the mouth of the Songjiang River around 7 p.m. the night before last. It was already dark, and a hurricane was raging with rough waves. The ship lost control and drifted with the wind and waves. It drifted to the Shizilin waters outside Wusongkou and ran aground on a beach. The ship immediately broke apart, and all the timber on board was scattered. The crew members all fell into the water. Fortunately, neighboring fishing boats risked their lives to rescue the crew one by one. Yesterday morning, the shipowner Chen Luji landed at Shizilin, walked to Songjiang, and hired a boat to go to the scene to try to salvage the timber. However, most of the timber had drifted away.

<p>Four Labor Unions Including the South Goods Workers' Union: The South Goods Workers' Union, the Yangna Industry Workers' Union, the South District Factory Workers' Union, and the Taikang Food Company Workers' Union oppose the International Company's purchase of the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company. The statement says the telephone company is a large enterprise in the international development plan and has a close relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihood. Now, imperialism, using economic power in the name of an international company, has contracted to purchase the full rights of the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company in the concession. This is a clear further suppression of our people's livelihood with the power of capital. In the past, imperialism has used all possible strategies to invade our country. This time, the International Company, without the permission of our government, privately transferred and dared to buy all the property rights of the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company, which is a blatant contempt for our country's sovereignty. Now, although our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has argued with reason, the unreasonable imperialism still continues to sign the agreement as if it did not hear anything. If it is realized, then the suffering Chinese will be more oppressed by imperialism. Compatriots across the country, to maintain the life of the country, we must oppose the International Company's purchase of the Sino-Foreign Telephone Company's property rights in the Shanghai Concession. We must unite and support our country's diplomacy. The Sino-Foreign Telephone Company should be nationalized.</p>

<p>By Yamamoto Kenzo</p>
<p>Translated by Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Industrial peasant art, though currently practiced in various parts of Europe, I have not examined its actual state in detail. Based on fragmented observations, it seems to be declining in highly industrialized areas like England. Originally, places like England are not known for peasant art, and the countryside seems to be on the verge of desolation. According to Mr. Buhira of the Agricultural Policy Section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there is a recent movement in England to revive rural crafts.</p>
<p>It is said that Lloyd George once stated, "Farmers have recently been drawn to rural home industries. For example, in the rural areas of Wales, methods of toy making are being taught, focusing on rural areas." The planned revival includes the production of wooden toys, wood carvings, tinplate handicrafts, leather handicrafts, basket making, lace, hand-woven fabrics, etc.</p>
<p>In Germany, which strives to promote small industries and focuses on managing "so-called dispersed labor," and in Russia, which has a large number of farmers and confines outdoor labor to the dreadfully long and cold winters, this kind of peasant art seems to be thriving. In Germany, various craft vocational schools are established to educate the children of farmers. For independent producers, there are craft conference centers jointly run by the government and private sectors in cities large and small nationwide. These seem to be organizations specifically designed to promote the formation of groups and aid the development of isolated craftspeople. Rural crafts, in particular, have the support of powerful sponsoring organizations. In large cities, they set up sales outlets, hold exhibitions, and give lectures, striving to promote and encourage them. In Russia and Italy, when promoting peasant art, the practice seems to be to draw inspiration from the ancient arts of their own countries. However, Germany is different. In German craft schools, the emphasis is generally on encouraging originality. For example, the motto of the renowned rural school in Wunhamroit, which teaches processing of white cloth, is "Simple, Strong, Bold." The aforementioned sponsoring organizations aimed at supporting craftspeople declare to the producers, "We hope that people themselves can discover their own originality, creative ability, and past successes and future possibilities. For all artisans who work in accordance with our principles, we will provide practical efforts and promote their businesses."</p>
<p>Russian peasant handicrafts, in terms of the large number of practitioners, can probably be considered the best in the world. In a report by the Russian Agricultural Administration about seventeen years ago, it was written, "Russian peasant handicrafts, although composed of vaguely defined small units, are an important production value second only to agricultural products." It also stated, "Russian peasant handicrafts include all categories of occupational industries."</p>
<p>From this, one can roughly get a glimpse of its widespread expansion. Since becoming Labor-Peasant Russia, peasant art seems to have been imagined as falling into decline, but there are also those who say that it is even more prosperous than in the imperial era. Regardless of which is true, the fact remains that the Labor-Peasant government values peasant handicrafts. The evidence for this can be seen in the fact that peasant handicrafts are directly under the Supreme Economic Council of Soviet Russia, with important figures as its leaders, and a specialized weekly newspaper is published.</p>
<p>In Russia, besides peasant art for self-use and industrial purposes, there is also a type of peasant art that can be called culturalism or an art movement – famous peasant art. This is the handicrafts centered on the Talashkino workshop led by Princess Maria Tenisheva, which was expanded to the ancient rural villages of Smolensk. Princess Tenisheva's ideas for this project seem to resonate with William Morris of England (Note B). Princess Maria shared Morris's hopes for the city and focused on the rural people.</p>
<p>That is, she wanted to enrich the daily lives of rural villagers with fine art, crafts, music, and theater, and to elevate their emotions. At that time, the princess and seven artists took rural men and women as disciples, and what they taught them was probably not only the techniques of dyeing, embroidery, or woodworking, wood carving, etc., but also deeper artistic intelligence. In short, the princess paid special attention to the fabric crafts called "Smolensk Embroidery," which had a modern flavor, were simple, and had an elegant quality. However, what has become of that lineage that originated only twenty years ago?</p>
<p>(Note B: William Morris was an English designer, poet, and socialist who established factories to promote fine art and crafts.)</p>
<p>To be suitable for the true meaning of folk education, and on one hand, to reflect urban tastes without falling into competition with mechanical products, but rather to coexist and oppose it, is necessary – where should the goal of future peasant art be placed? – I look back on my own experiences and have received many suggestions from the Smolensk fabric crafts. I see that the absence or complete demise of crafts for self-use and the lack of vitality in industrial peasant art produced in modern rural areas are inevitable. However, the techniques honed by industrial use may at some point be applied to produce living peasant art.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Thoughts After Viewing the Bai E Painting Exhibition by Guan Han <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>What is the difference between thoughts and criticism? Thoughts are subjective, while criticism is objective. However, whether subjective or objective, all conclusions must be based on something. To state my reason for writing these thoughts, I cannot avoid starting with a familiar opening.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that I am simply not qualified to judge other people's art. Although I am a follower in the art world, I have never received profound artistic knowledge. The genesis of these thoughts can be said to be from my own understanding, and I have some grasp of it. Even though I have not fully learned in the art garden, I have not stopped studying. Therefore, all the art exhibitions at sea leave my footprints.</p>
<p>This time, the Bai E Research Institute's practice exhibition gave me a deep impression. Although there were not many exhibits, it has given me many new paths. Each painting has its own characteristics. The ones I admire and respect the most are:</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the backward Chinese art world is difficult to progress.

This is probably because the scholars in the art gardens do not value the value of art. Perhaps because the graduation time in the art gardens is predetermined, scholars do not get enough basic research time, so it is difficult to make the appreciators sympathize with the works. There are also many erroneous atoms. I don't want to go into detail anymore, because the content of this article is only to express feelings for Bai E, so writing to this point will be temporarily considered an ending. I will write another article for discussion when I have the opportunity.</p>

Although he himself was not a Puritan, he contemplated matters of conscience just like his ancestors. However, he studied the conflicts of character with the intention of constructing stories from them. He contemplated as an artist in general, whereas the New Englanders of the past were not artists at all. They were serious, uninteresting people without much awareness of beauty, and they actually believed that beautiful things must be evil. Hawthorne turned them around and made them interesting.</p>

After graduating from Bowdoin College, he lived in solitude, writing short stories and honing his writing style, which was excellent. Some of the short stories are small masterpieces. However, for a long time, the American public did not give his works a sincere welcome. Only a few writers, including Edgar Allan Poe, appreciated his value.

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e179">Modern Writer by Wen Zhi <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>By Wang Fen</p>
<p>Published by Zhen Mei Shan</p>
<p>"Modern Writer" includes ten short stories: "Behind the Mountain," "Escape," "Two Rows," "An Old Man," "Temptation," "Modern Writer," "Fourth Night of the New Year," "In the Accumulation of Snow," "In Front of the Rainy Mountain," "Visiting the Grave." Each of these stories has a different type of person. In these different types of people, the author expresses them very delicately. Indeed, in this era, these characters can be found no matter what. In our daily lives, these characters can also be seen. However, in the eyes of ordinary people, they are often easily overlooked. The author, however, firmly grasps them, without letting go of a single detail. For example, "An Old Man," if we go out, old men like this are easily seen. "A train flashed past the window. As soon as the train moved, the old man leaned back and cursed the train, the driver, and even the current road administration. However, he also spoke of important party and state officials, and those who heard it turned pale." (Page 34) The Chinese are most fond of cursing others, but they are not aware of themselves, so that they end up "not being able to say it clearly." Moreover, they are accustomed to pleasing themselves, being selfish, and blaming others for being selfish. Knowing the contradiction, they are still unwilling to admit defeat. Secondly, they like to talk nonsense, flatter those above them, and oppress those below them. The old man even said, "I had expected that you two are students. So well-behaved. Really. The current situation is only possible with students. Good for them to study. Studying to do things for the public. So patriotic. If they didn't parade and give speeches, we probably wouldn't know about national shame and National Day. Ah, students always see things clearly." (Page 36) This may be the ancient style of respecting scholars, because "As soon as the car stopped, the old man let the students who were crowding at the door go first, and then he rushed to leave first." So, what kind of impression does this old man who emerges in our minds leave?</p>
<p>Originally, the subject matter of creation does not need to be so far-fetched. Selecting fragments of life from the ranks of the people and expressing them with artistic skill is indeed needed at this time. Because the author is influenced by rural life, his descriptions tend to focus on rural areas and the lower classes. He does not like to pursue trends, so he does not like to depict youthful romances.</p>
<p>The ten works in "Modern Writer" all have distinct styles. The author's descriptive skills are very economical. Like the rascal who opened the coffin to steal the corpse's clothes, I have heard this story since I was a child. Now the author focuses on the psychological description, which vividly jumps on the paper. This increases the infinite horror more than hearing it. Also, like the matter of opium prohibition, the ugly history of "those in their positions seeking their own interests" has been seen countless times. It is true that "to be honest," how can opium be completely prohibited? Now, aren't we both breaking the law here?" Then, corrupt officials will never be completely overthrown. Also, like the author describing the little-footed aunt's widowhood and loss of virtue, this symbolizes the danger of modern women. Once tempted, they change their minds. "The breasts are as high as when she came, only the belly is a little different." Also, like Bai Gengyu rushing to gamble, but being caught by the gamblers, because his braid was grabbed, he became angry and "tonight is all because of this braid" took scissors and cut it off. The description is very profound.</p>
<p>The author's description of children's innocence is both cute, funny, and pitiful. "San Gou was very happy, because tomorrow's dish will be eaten by himself after all. He knew that Grandpa would not eat it. In his mind, meat, braised pork, vegetables with pork, braised until red, with a lot of sugar, the soup is purple, that's how it tastes. Fish is fish braised with greens, with small bones, hard, not tasty. Shredded pork, shredded pork is also good. Golden flower vegetables, he won't touch them tomorrow. Thinking, his throat gurgled, and he swallowed a mouthful of saliva." (Page 134) Not saying that putting the kite on top of people's houses means losing a sumptuous grave-visiting meal.</p>
<p>The author is a student, so naturally he is inevitably touched by school life. "This collection is named 'Modern Writer' because what is described in this article is a way of life that I have never observed in my past eighteen years, and the encounter with this matter has made the deepest impression on my heart." (Page 5) It can be seen that the author's impression is profound, so the writing is particularly energetic. This describes the arrogance of a college student publishing a new literary book. Later, the members found out that the cover was something from the club, so they questioned him. As a result, he withdrew and started the Spring Breeze Society three days later. Characters like Mr. Ping are everywhere among modern college students. In fact, they just don't have the cultivation of group life, only know how to be selfish. In this collection, the author's satirical tone is very strong. Precisely because of this, it is more powerfully set off.</p>
<p>I like "In Front of the Rainy Mountain" and "Visiting the Grave" the most. The structure and the like are better than the other chapters. Secondly, "Modern Writer" and "Behind the Mountain." However, it seems that the author has a kind of shortcoming in the collection, that is, the atmosphere of depression, distress, pessimism, and sadness is too strong. Although I am not absolutely demanding a generous spirit and an exciting tone, I always think that we should inject energetic, hopeful, bright, willful, and spiritual blood serum into society, with considerable enlightenment. We can't sting like a poisonous bee's sting that is irrelevant. We have found the crux, and we have to overcome it. Then the author is a "warrior." Let's wait for the publication of the second collection.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Women's Reading Afterthoughts <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>A collection of short stories by Ling Shuhua</p>
<p>Like a sparrow's nimble thoughts, a snake's agile penmanship, this is the most fitting description of Ms. Shuhua. Although her thoughts are not particularly expansive, encompassing all of life, she can still use her vividly depicted women to give readers a deep impression through her criticisms of servants, the lives of female students, and everything else.</p>
<p>We all know the author is a "woman," so she can especially deeply depict the psychology of women. Although some may say she exaggerates too much, I believe this is possible. Don't you believe in the Yu Ru in "Sickness"? This kind of person exists. If you still don't believe me now, then I can briefly record Yu Ru's deeds so everyone can see:</p>
<p>Yu Ru's husband, Zhiqing, was sick. She advised him to go to Xishan to recuperate, but because they had no money, they couldn't go. Yu Ru couldn't bear to see her beloved husband continue like this, not getting treatment, so she borrowed money everywhere, but all her efforts were in vain. While cursing the coldness of the world, she started painting and selling her paintings to earn money and go to recuperate with her beloved husband. While painting, she suffered her beloved husband's suspicion, and her husband even considered divorce. Later, everyone finally understood.</p>
<p>Here, I can say that the woman is worthy of praise, and such women are possible in the world. As for the man, Zhiqing's suspicion is just a common kind of jealousy. I say that the characters in this novel are very ordinary, but what is valuable is that the author can describe things so wonderfully, without making people feel that this is an ordinary thing.</p>
<p>The above is regarding the technique and structure of the "Sickness" piece. As for its content, it is a major social issue.</p>
<p>People should work, but because of "sickness," should they rest? If they should rest, but have no money, how should they solve this problem? This becomes a social problem. As for Yu Ru forging other people's paintings, using deceitful means to trick people, there is inevitably a moral flaw. Although Zhiqing reproached her, she said:</p>
<p>"I don't care anymore, I can't control it anymore," such heartbreaking words. From the perspective of "emotion," it is "understandable," but from the perspective of reason, it is immoral. Can we accept such people in the world? This becomes a very difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is just one example in Ms. Shuhua's works. Many others also have this characteristic: placing the contradictions and shortcomings of society in the work. If we analyze and introduce this collection carefully, we can gain even more.</p>
<p>In the article "Little Liu," Little Liu used to ridicule women with children. When Little Liu was a student, there was a woman in her class, so she gathered her comrades and wanted to report her to the principal, not allowing the woman to study. Later, she thought it would be better to directly ridicule the woman, so during sewing class, she arbitrarily joked about the woman, and as a result, the woman ran away. During this joking, the author vividly portrays that playful attitude of Little Liu and her party, with a pen as agile as a snake emerging from its hole.</p>
<p>After Little Liu went through this student era,</p>
<p>she finally had children herself. Such a contradictory fact, and the marriage of those who advocate celibacy, are commonly seen among young people. I said that the author is accustomed to writing about ordinary things, but the writing is extraordinary, that is "good."</p>
<p>The "Mr. Li" piece is a bit lesser. The main theme is not obvious, but the calm attitude of the protagonist, Mr. Li, can still give the reader some impression. As for what she said when she was a dean,</p>
<p>"Every Sunday," most of the letters are love letters, "It's no wonder, these children are at the age of writing love letters,"...</p>
<p>She lightly and clearly impresses the common things in school life on the paper and runs into the reader's mind.</p>
<p>Yes, these are common things in schools.</p>
<p>The theme of "Seeing off the Car" is a humorous matter (that is, the author often likes to use humorous facts in other articles), but in the dark, it fully praises a woman who specializes in criticizing the shortcomings of servants, for example:</p>
<p>"Miss Wang, you haven't managed a household, so you don't know the shortcomings of the people below. Alas, there isn't a single honest one. The other day I asked him to buy a chicken, and when I weighed it, it was clearly a little over one catty and four ounces,</p>
<p>but he reported one catty and five ounces. Bean sprouts are fourteen coppers a catty, I asked a few days ago, and he said people won't sell it for less than fifteen coppers..."</p>
<p>The whole article is full of such talk about the shortcomings of servants. No wonder her husband had to stop her and say:</p>
<p>"Why don't you change the subject? Always talking about them, aren't you tired of it?"</p>
<p>Yes, it's too much, just like young students who love to talk about the opposite sex, they themselves don't feel tired of it.</p>
<p>Enough small talk, I will say one more "Woman" and then shut up.</p>
<p>The layout of "Woman" is so lovable, humorous and tight, everywhere showing the author's painstaking tailoring, and even more showing the author's innocence. The Second Honest in the whole "Woman" article is very noticeable and lovable. Let's optimistically wait for the future masters of China. The female protagonist's gentle means separate the two of them. I say it's both interesting and very effective. Isn't this article a proof, friends? If you encounter such a thing, please try it like this.</p>
<p>This article is also very well written and very satisfying. Shuhua used it as the book title for this reason.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Diesel Engines for Automobiles by Paige-Graham <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Highly Effective and Very Economical</p>
<p>Last year, one of the great advances in the automatic machinery industry was the adoption of the Diesel internal compression engine on automobiles and airplanes. The Diesel engine used on automobiles has not yet left the trial period, but it has been very successful in airplanes, especially for the efficiency it produces when burning low-grade fuel. The first Diesel engine was invented by German Rudolf Diesel in 1897. It was crude and heavy and not suitable for practical use. Later, it was gradually improved, and the machine body and weight were both modified until it was adopted by steamships. Its economy is beyond the reach of other engines. It is even more suitable for large ships at sea. Before 1919, Diesel engines were not noticed by Americans, but in that year, they were praised by various machinists and recognized their strength. Oil mining and transportation of oil in the west, from oil wells to refineries, in large cities and their surroundings, must use a power machine to generate great power, and the cost must be saved.</p>
<p>The weight of the power machines used in oil mining areas is not affected. Therefore, Diesel engines are used everywhere in oil fields. Today, in oil-producing areas, all kinds of stationary Diesel engines can be seen everywhere. They are stable when used and have great results. This kind of engine can be used for a long time. It can handle fast or slow speeds, day or night. Since 1919, the towing, transportation, and fishing industries have flourished along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in seaports around the world. As a result, Diesel engines have also been widely used. Therefore, automatic mechanical engineers know that the adoption of this engine in automobiles and airplanes is not far away and will be greater than any other use. But using an engine weighing 1,100 pounds in an automobile is something that ordinary people cannot imagine. Who would believe that it could be driven at 50 miles per hour? As for having 23 million steamships equipped with this engine and sailing at sea, wouldn't that be a joke? Therefore, before 1919, automatic mechanical engineers viewed Diesel engines very indifferently.</p>
<p>Dr. Sperry's first Diesel engine invented in the United States weighed 22 pounds per horsepower. There is no doubt about its great efficiency, but it is far from being used in automatic locomotives. Last year, Dr. Shi also built a Diesel engine, reducing the weight to three pounds per horsepower. In addition, one weighing one and a half pounds is also being tested. Automatic mechanical engineers regard this latest style and its theory as practical and valuable.</p>
<p>Dr. Tauber, one of the giants of Diesel engine research in the United States, built a machine with compression as its main purpose, weighing two and a half pounds per horsepower. Currently, there are forty companies in the United States testing this Diesel engine for automobile use. A few months ago, German inventor Brockmann was granted a patent for the electrolytic gas production method for Diesel engine fuel injection. The main purpose of this method is to alleviate the tightening force on the walls of the cylinder when it is compressed. Its value is better understood in Europe than in America, because Europe is often a huge testing ground for automatic mechanical objects.</p>
<p>Speaking of the basic use of the Diesel engine, it is very simple. Inject fuel oil into the cylinder and draw in air. The air is compressed and heated, and as a result, the oil burns on its own. To achieve maximum efficiency, it is necessary for the walls of the cylinder to have a huge tightening force. Therefore, it is very obvious that the metal required to manufacture this machine must have extremely high resistance. However, on the one hand, it cannot be too heavy, otherwise the economic efficiency of operation will be suppressed by the capacity. In recent years, manufacturers of Diesel engines have used cast iron as the material. Recently, a kind of lead mixture was invented in the automotive industry, which has great strength and is also light. Automotive machinists have now used lead to make Diesel engines, and it is said that the results are very good. As for airplanes, there is no problem. In a few years, lead will be used entirely.</p>
<p>If the Diesel engine is used in automobiles instead of the current gasoline engine, the cost will only be one-fifth of that. There is no need to use spark plugs. Management is smooth and simple. All dangers of incomplete combustion and adjustment can be avoided, because each cylinder is automatically installed and adjusted. A few years ago, a fuel using dicarbonyl gasoline was invented, using the kinetic energy of each piston in the cylinder. This fuel is more expensive than ordinary gasoline. Although it is very effective, it is not popular with drivers. If a Diesel engine is used, the result is the same, and the cost is still lower than that of ordinary gasoline.</p>
<p>The cylinder of the Diesel engine can be cleaned after each action, because the force of the compressed air is very effective. Lower-grade fuel can be used. The machine must be made of metal to maintain the tightening force. This is a problem studied by automotive machinists around the world. Recently, the price of automobiles has become lower and lower, and the use of airplanes has become more and more widespread. Automatic mechanical engineers are seeking economical and effective power in order to have a large output. The use of Diesel engines has been very widespread in recent years, and it is no longer the same as when Rudolf Diesel invented the machine in 1897.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Mack Motor Engineers and Workers Experienced in Manufacturing Eight-Cylinder Cars <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The excellent performance of Mack eight-cylinder cars is rare in the world. The root cause is that the machinists and workers have mechanical knowledge and experience. Therefore, the manufacturing is meticulous and the work is serious. Mack's various eight-cylinder car products are extremely exquisite and universally praised.</p>
<p>In the past four years, the personnel of the Mack factory have been focusing on large eight-cylinder cars, working together to research and improve them, with great results. Since 1926, they have changed their policy, abandoning the old and replacing it with the new. Now, in addition to manufacturing large eight-cylinder cars, there are no other types. The work of the entire factory personnel is focused and not distracted. Mack machinists and workers can be said to be experts in manufacturing large eight-cylinder cars.</p>
<p>The minds of the people in the Mack Machinery Department have all been "eight-cylindered." The first manufacturing was not done blindly, but was prepared early and tested in advance. Therefore, in these four years, although the time was very short, the results were quite impressive. The greatest goal now is to make the large eight-cylinder car a car with excellent operation and economical durability.</p>
<p>Now, all employees of the Mack factory, from workers to department heads, are all focused on the design and construction of large eight-cylinder cars. In the past, eight-cylinder cars were considered difficult, but now they are not. The manufacturing method and organization of eight-cylinder cars are regarded as normal and without any difficulty.</p>
<p>Mack cars have many features, such as tuners, dual low-drop exhaust pipes, etc. When workers manufacture and assemble them, they not only know the object but also understand the reason. This kind of knowledge and scholarship cannot be obtained in a day or two. It is only after four years of work experience that today's success has been achieved.</p>
<p>Mack managers and salespersons all know the advantages of large eight-cylinder cars. The style is exquisite, and the operation is quick. Even car owners and customers are aware that eight-cylinder cars are becoming increasingly popular and are paying close attention. Among eight-cylinder cars, Mack can be said to be the best. It is truly worthy of being the leader of eight-cylinder cars. To learn more about eight-cylinder cars, you can inquire at the Mack Motor Manufacturing Factory. They will definitely provide a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>The first Mack large eight-cylinder car was initially completed in 1926. In the past four years, various eight-cylinder cars, the No. 79 eight-cylinder car, the No. 69 eight-cylinder car, and the Mack-Luxford car have been sold at reasonable prices, ranging from US$1,000 to US$2,300. The goods are genuine, the price is fair, and they are cheap and beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Statistics on Car Accidents in Shanghai in the First Half of the Year <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>A Total of 5,381 Incidents</p>
<p>Exceeding the Records of Previous Years</p>
<p>Cars are like tigers in the city. Even a child of three feet knows that they can kill people and cause disasters. Shanghai is the largest commercial port in Asia. Since the automobile industry has flourished, the number of vehicles in the city also tops other cities in the Far East. When there are many vehicles, it is easy to cause accidents. This is inevitable. We only need to read the newspaper to see that car accidents injuring people happen almost every day. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the number of car accidents injuring people in the Concession in the first half of this year has exceeded the statistics of previous years, creating a new record that has never been seen before. The number of people injured is as high as several hundred, and the financial losses are even more inestimable. The authorities should strive to remedy this bad phenomenon. Therefore, the Municipal Council has repeatedly urged</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>pedestrians to pay attention, and on the one hand, also repeatedly warned drivers, in order to reduce the number of accidents.</p>
<p>From January 1st to June 30th, in the six months before and after, there were a total of 5,381 car accidents in the Shanghai Public Concession. Among them, 63 people were injured and died, and 1,967 people were injured but did not die. However, among these 1,967 people, there are also many people whose injuries cannot be restored and will be disabled for life. Therefore, the financial losses are really uncountable. In June, nine people were crushed to death by cars, including six pedestrians. When they were walking, they were not careful and wanted to cross the road, so they were hit by cars. Comparing all the car accidents in the first half of this year with last year, there were only 4,642 in the first half of 1929. The difference is obvious.</p>
<p>In 1929, there were a total of 9,691 car accidents. Based on the situation in the first half of this year, if the methods adopted by the Municipal Council in the second half of the year to eliminate accidents are ineffective, then the number of accidents this year will exceed previous years by a large margin. This can be asserted. In June of this year, there were 939 accidents, in which 349 people were injured. The report for March was 982, which is even more than in June. Among all the accidents in June, there were 132 bicycle accidents, of which 70 were caused by the carelessness of the rider. There were 710 car accidents, and the number of people injured was 212. There were 50 people injured by bicycles. There were 16 people injured in streetcar accidents, and there were also 100 public bus accidents, in which 70 people were injured. In addition, other means of transportation, including rickshaws, injured 58 people in total.</p>
<p>According to the investigation reports of the patrolmen on the accidents that occurred in various places, in June, 153 people were injured in all cases because they were careless and hit by cars. Nanjing Road is a place where cars and horses are concentrated. The number of accidents in June still accounted for the majority. Two people died immediately after being hit. The second was Sichuan Road, where one person was crushed to death. One person died near Xinzha Bridge, two people on Zhejiang Road, and one person on Yangshupu Road. During this summer, there are more cars on the road in the evening than usual, because they are all out for a drive. Moreover, Chinese people are accustomed to having too many passengers in a car, and these vehicles are mostly rented from car dealerships. The drivers are not very experienced, and they drive on the road at speeds that exceed the limit and honk their horns frequently, causing other vehicles and drivers to be confused. As a result, accidents are more likely to occur. The patrolmen are now paying attention to these drivers. On the one hand, they are also urging pedestrians to be vigilant when walking, so that they can avoid disasters. Overtaking a car on a narrow road is also prohibited. The speed should not be too fast. When driving, everyone must drive on one side and not be chaotic, in order to avoid accidents and not injure a person or a thing.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Diesel Cars by Ding Zuce <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The fuel for modern cars is generally gasoline, so they are often called gasoline cars. Gasoline is a relatively expensive commodity among fuel oils. Although users of automobiles in producing countries or non-producing areas can still get an economical means of transportation, the production of gasoline will gradually decrease, and the desire to seek a new, more economical fuel is what the industrial and commercial sectors think about every day. A few years ago, some people advocated using alcohol and diesel as substitutes for gasoline. The experiment of alcohol has achieved considerable results, but its value has not been seen to be very cheap. As for diesel, it is indeed the cheapest of liquid fuels, and it has been adopted as fuel for land-based stationary engines and ship engines, and it has shown very suitable and economical results. The reason why it cannot be used as fuel for automobile engines is that the engine body is too heavy and the operation is not sensitive. Now the German Mercedes-Benz (MERCEDES-BEOZ) car factory has broken through the above-mentioned difficult problems and created diesel passenger cars and freight cars, while in the United States, which manufactures the most cars in the specialized field, there has been no official product heard. This is because the United States has cheap gasoline supply.</p>
<p>Recently, the American Cummins Diesel Engine Company installed a ship diesel engine manufactured by them on a 1925 model car chassis to test whether the diesel engine can replace the gasoline engine and to see what the differences are. After the car was fully assembled, it started from Columbus, passed through Indiana, Detroit, and arrived in New York. It returned from New York to its original departure point, with extremely satisfactory results.</p>
<p>This test drive totaled 2,780 miles, passing through all kinds of roads, including plains and mountains. The maximum speed reached 55 miles per hour. The stability of the journey was almost the same as that of a gasoline car. Diesel is only sold for eight cents to one dime a gallon in the United States. (Approximately 25 to 30 cents in Chinese currency.) It greatly surprised the engineering community.</p>
<p>The diesel engine used this time was a four-cylinder type. The cylinder inner diameter was four and a half inches. The stroke was six inches. The horsepower was 50 horsepower. The car used was not specially manufactured. It was an old-style car (1925 model), which had its original gasoline engine removed, and a ship diesel engine was cut off its heavy legs and put in. The other parts of the car were not changed.</p>
<p>The diesel car was driven by Mr. Cummins, the manager of Cummins Diesel Engine Company. Its driving stability was no different from that of ordinary cars. When driving in the most prosperous areas of New York from 4 pm to 5 pm, there was no difficulty encountered. It was not noticed by pedestrians either. The exterior of the car had no special shape and no special sound. Except for the small words "Cummins Company Diesel Test Car" written on the tire cover hanging behind the car, there were no other marks.</p>
<p>Before this test, the company had no preparations. On the day of departure, the car was processed for only one hour and five minutes from 9:30 in the morning before it was put on the road. Until the end of the trip, it traveled a total of 25 hours, 2,780 miles, and used 102 gallons of diesel. At seven cents of US dollars per gallon, it cost a total of more than seven US dollars for fuel. Based on the same type of gasoline car, it would cost 86 US dollars for gasoline to travel the same distance. This proves the simplicity of diesel cars. The consumption is only one-twelfth of that of gasoline cars, and the weight of the car is 6,000 pounds, about twice as heavy as a gasoline car.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Cummins, he claimed to people that he only wanted to prove this time that ship or ordinary mobile diesel engines</p>
<p>can also be used in cars. He had heard people talking about the clumsiness of diesel engines and that it was not suitable to drive cars with them. He personally tested it to prove the untrustworthiness of rumors. He also believes that the success of the first test is most suitable for diesel engines to be installed on heavy vehicles such as freight cars, agricultural vehicles, or public buses. It is also possible to install them on ordinary passenger cars.</p>

<p>This year, the automotive industry will undergo significant changes. American statistics expert Mr. Barresgo recently discussed "The Automobile Industry in 1930" at a meeting of the Western University Club in New York. He stated that this year, the American automobile industry will experience drastic changes. The reason is that smaller companies will inevitably be acquired by two or three major corporations. Mr. Barresgo believes that, according to statistics, the output of the two major companies accounts for 65% of the total, and this 65% also accounts for 80% of all low-priced cars. In such a situation, smaller companies will find it extremely difficult to compete with large corporations with strong capital. As a result, they will inevitably be acquired. If you don't believe it, observe in three or four years; America will only have three or four major companies left at that time, and their products will represent the entire United States. Furthermore, banks have repeatedly indicated in recent years that financial health is not as robust as in the past. Therefore, this year's trend will be that the sales of low-priced cars will be more robust than those of high-priced cars. Large corporations, with sufficient capital, have extremely low unit costs, making it easy to win the favor of the public. Smaller companies, lacking the ability, reluctantly lower their prices. However, if large corporations make things difficult for them by deliberately lowering car prices, smaller companies will suffer significant losses, and their operations will be difficult to sustain. This phenomenon is becoming increasingly apparent, and the actual situation is undeniable. Currently, car sales can reach 3,500,000 units, and it is difficult to expect any higher figures. His words contain considerable truth.</p>
<p>Overland's Five Million Mile Test Drive</p>
<p>Williams-Overland Company, to promote and test its new Williams six-cylinder car, will hold a 5,000,000-mile test drive. The key aspects of the test drive will be hill climbing, speed, horsepower, and so on. All car enthusiasts can participate. For example, to test hill climbing, a mountain road must first be selected to test its power. To test whether it can travel 48 miles per hour, it can be tested on a flat road. The company predicts that thousands of people will participate in the test drive. Therefore, within a week, the 5,000,000-mile test can be achieved. The results will be easy to determine.</p>
<p>Changes to Automobile Racing Regulations</p>
<p>The American Automobile Association's Racing Department recently issued new regulations, stipulating that each race is limited to 100 miles, with a prize of $50 per mile, so 100 miles will be worth $5,000. The routes to be taken have also been specified to ensure uniformity and facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Prediction of This Year's Automobile Production Volume</p>
<p>Mr. Bain, Chairman of the U.S. National Business Survey Association, told people today that this year's U.S. automobile production volume could reach 4,600,000 units. This includes both passenger and freight vehicles. Based on observations over the past three months, the outlook for 1930 is not weak. February's production exceeded the same period last year by a significant amount. Sales of various components are excellent, and the banking market feels solid. Therefore, those who say that this year will be worse than last year, I cannot agree with them.</p>
<p>Installation of Radios in Cars to Be Implemented</p>
<p>The installation of radios in cars has been widely discussed, as it greatly benefits society. The board of directors of the Radio Manufacturing Industry Association held a meeting this year and decided to implement large-scale installation measures. According to the planned schedule, the board of directors will issue a public announcement, stating the benefits of installing radios in cars and providing detailed explanations to those who oppose the installation. The people in charge are Mr. Metcalfe and Mr. Colbert, both strong leaders in this field. However, government approval is still needed. The U.S. government believes that after radios are installed in cars, there will be many drawbacks, disrupting public safety, and car accidents will be unavoidable. Therefore, they have not yet expressed their agreement. The inventors of car radios are two Bostonians, Mr. Hosmer and Mr. Whickesler, both employees of the Automatic Radio Factory. At this time, because the government does not allow it, they have invented another type of device that only allows calls when the car is stopped and becomes ineffective when the car is moving. In this way, passengers will not talk loudly in the car, and when the vehicle is damaged, they can call for help. Such a compromise solution can satisfy both parties. Recently, this device has been submitted to the government for testing. It is unknown what the officials in charge think of it.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Choosing Good Gasoline is the Only Way to Save Money (Continued) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>KH</p>
<p>Why Does the Engine Knock?</p>
<p>In other words, about 25% of the heat is converted into work, and the rest is dissipated into the air through the cooling water and the exhaust pipe.</p>
<p>Even if the wisdom of engineers can restrain some waste, the expansion is inevitably limited. Because the compression of the mixture before ignition has a certain limit, and because the upward stroke and downward stroke of the engine are equal, the expansion is limited by the compression that we can implement. After the mixture is ignited, we want it to expand powerfully on the one hand, and we want it to expand evenly on the other hand. If the expansion is too powerful, the engine will move violently and unstably, which will inevitably cause knocking and vibration, lose original power, be over-burnt, and the car will perform poorly on mountains. Worse, if this condition persists, spark plugs and valves will be damaged, as will bearings. As a result, car repair shops can make a fortune from it.</p>
<p>Therefore, preventing knocking is an essential element of modern good gasoline. I will not talk about the words of experts. I can say that the creation of this characteristic is achieved by examining the combustion speed of the mixture in the cylinder, selecting the most suitable raw materials to restrain the combustion speed, and then processing and mixing it, so that the resulting gasoline contains extremely high anti-knock properties and can withstand the most severe compression.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Characteristics of Driving <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The second element of gasoline, of course, is the convenience of driving, which is known to everyone. Because the most annoying thing is that the car is sluggish and difficult to drive. A car that is sluggish and does not drive is harmful to the battery, harmful to people's temperament, and, what is more, harmful to the engine. Because if starting fails repeatedly, excessive raw gasoline is sucked into the cylinder, washing away the protective lubricant on the cylinder wall, eventually damaging the engine. All major gasoline companies pay great attention to the characteristics of driving. It is now well known that the specific gravity and weight of gasoline have nothing to do with its volatility and ease of starting. What needs to be paid attention to is its mixture.</p>

<p>Other key points include: (1) Consistency as shown by the OLP table. (2) Good distribution, such as rapid heating, stable operation, and good acceleration. (3) Cleanliness, because even a slight amount of foreign matter can cause the engine components to corrode internally and cause gum</p>

<p>Among Hudson's various cars, the 126-inch wheelbase</p>

<p>substance precipitation, which causes inconveniences such as valve sticking.</p>
<p>Although I have been involved in the automotive industry for many years and pay close attention to all its aspects, large and small, I never knew that gasoline production had become such a specialized science. It was not until I was invited to visit the British Petroleum Company last summer, and recently had the opportunity to tour the Shell gasoline manufacturing plant, that I suddenly realized the procedures for manufacturing gasoline.</p>
<p>The care and caution of each procedure, the limitlessness of machinery and equipment, and the painstaking research and testing truly amazed me at first sight. If my leaders had not told me that even the slightest mistake would have a huge impact, I would hardly understand why so much money and manpower are spent on something that ordinary people consider ordinary.</p>
<p>From the perspective of an experienced car enthusiast, the most noteworthy is the engine test room. The room is full of all kinds of mechanical monsters used to improve cars. I found a new invention that moved me to admiration, which is the so-called variable compression engine. Its compression force can be arbitrarily changed and measured when the machine is running.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Mechanical Monsters <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>With this engine, equipped with various instruments sufficient to verify its operation, major gasoline companies test various types of gasoline. Not only can they determine its anti-knock properties, but they can also determine its power efficiency and its characteristics. The companies formulate standards on the one hand and seek progress on the other, deliberately overthrowing them.</p>
<p>In the gasoline storage room, I also saw an extraordinary engine. A transparent crystal window is opened on the top of the cylinder. From this, not only can the flame of the explosion be seen, but the speed of travel can also be measured. This method is quite related to the anti-knock properties of gasoline. I have already explained it earlier.</p>
<p>Many engines explode more than 2,000 times per minute. It is hard to believe that viewing from the window can obtain a very accurate image, but we know that the results of its experiments are indeed effective without a doubt.</p>
<p>I saw many engines and other machines in the place, all of which are specially used to improve cars. Unfortunately, due to space limitations and my limited ability, I cannot fully describe them. Although I must pay tribute to the experiments on the small Morris engine's ease of driving, the experimental work is almost heartbreaking and frightening.</p>
<p>The engine is set in a special room. One day, the room is surrounded by radiators, and the temperature of the whole room becomes like the Arctic Ocean in the freezing cold. The next day, another method is used to turn this room into a tropical climate. The small Morris moves freely and happily in this extremely cold and extremely hot environment.</p>
<p>I often like to use a specific brand of gasoline. According to my recent experience, this is actually necessary today. I would like to introduce this method to readers. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e193">Hankou City Street Tree Planting Plan Wu Fei <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Hankou city, in terms of its terrain, is not very suitable for afforestation. However, places such as city streets and lake embankment sides are all suitable for planting trees to enhance the scenery. As for maintaining public health and utilizing the main and auxiliary products of trees, they are secondary. Now I will talk about the street tree planting in the afforestation plan, summarizing its main points, roughly divided into three aspects, namely, one is the arrangement of existing roadside trees, two is the new planting and replanting of roadside trees this year, and three is the planting plan for roadside trees in the future.</p>
<p>There is also the arrangement of existing roadside trees. The roadside trees in Hankou City started in concessions and special zones. Later, the Chinese界 also followed suit in planting. However, the street police protection is weak, and they are often destroyed. The withered, dead, and aging trees are sparse and uneven. Moreover, the tree species and sizes planted before and after the same street are different and uneven, so they are unsightly. Now the municipal government has prepared four matters that should be arranged to remedy it. (1) All withered, dead, and aging existing roadside trees should be removed, and replanted with trees of the same species and size as the existing trees. (2) For those planted too densely, carefully sparse them to gradually make the plant spacing consistent. The dug-up trees should be replanted in other places. (3) When two or more different types of trees are mixed on the same street, remove the one that grows worse and replace it with a tree of the same species and size as the one that grows better. If there are trees of older age on the same street, use the pruning method to control the growth of the older ones, so that their shape and size gradually approach the youngest trees. All these four are plans for the arrangement of existing roadside trees.</p>
<p>Planting roadside trees this year In order to enhance the beauty of the city and maintain hygiene, roadside trees are specially planted on the newly built Yanjiang Road and Zhongzheng Road. The tree species used on Yanjiang Road are French plane trees, thorn cypresses, and palm trees. Zhongzheng Road uses large-leaf willows. The roadside trees that have been planted on each street have suffered repeated external damage, and many have withered. It is also planned to replant them all to enhance the appearance. The tree species selected should be of the same species and size as the existing trees on each street. The tree species are trees such as plane trees, locusts, catalpa, ash trees, golden rain trees, poplar trees, and large-leaf willows, which are used for roadside trees, and it is advisable to use those with a tree height of more than one zhang, a chest height diameter of more than one inch, lush branches and leaves, and a straight trunk. The newly planted trees: (1) On Yanjiang Road, a tree planting zone with a width of one meter is set up on the sidewalk. The row spacing is about four and a half meters from the houses. Other roadside trees are planted in the lawn, one meter away from the road, and one plant is planted every eight meters. About 124 plants are needed for both sides. However, no planting is done at the intersections of streets and alleys. (2) On Zhongzheng Road, one tree is planted every seven meters, and about 300 plants are needed for both sides. The sidewalks on this road are very narrow and not enough for planting. It is planned to dig holes on both sides of the road, about 0.75 meters from the human-shaped ditch. At the intersection of the streets, planting should start at six or seven meters from the intersection. The number of trees to be replanted on each street is a total of 1,564 plants. The plant spacing and the distance from houses for replanted trees should be in accordance with the original distance of the planted trees to show uniformity. The roadside trees on each street that are planted too densely should be carefully dug up and replanted in other places. On Fu Dong Road, because the side line is too narrow, it is inconvenient to set up supports. It is now decided to widen the side line by one meter on each side to avoid hindering the growth of the trees and to facilitate the setting up of</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Set up supports. Therefore, the seedling fee, excavation fee, packaging fee, transportation fee, planting fee, support setting fee, and miscellaneous fee for the new posts or sleeve plantings to be carried out this year total 2,550.874 yuan.</p>
<p>Future tree planting plan The tree planting of roadside trees must have the following four conditions: (1) The shape and color of the trees should be able to exert natural beauty and enhance the beauty of the city streets. (2) There should be shade to shield the summer sun without hindering the dryness of the road. (3) Suitable for local soil and water. (4) Rapid growth and great resistance. There are many tree species supplied to roadside trees. Among locust trees, plane trees, poplar trees, catalpa trees, large-leaf willows, and French plane trees, French plane trees, large-leaf willows, and locust trees are the easiest to grow. Therefore, this time, the above-mentioned several species are also designated as roadside trees. Its configuration method is to plant trees on all streets with a width of more than 15 meters, totaling about 109,700 meters, totaling about 32,020 plants. However, among the new plants, about 6,081 plants have already been planted. Therefore, excluding this number, 2939 plants should be planted on this road. According to this number of plants, how many should be planted each year, and how many years later this number can be completed, will depend on the street construction plan, and cannot be predetermined. For the convenience of calculation, the completion period is set to ten years, then about 2,600 plants should be planted each year. In addition, the number of plants replanted and renewed each year is calculated as one-tenth of the total number, then 320 plants in the first year, 3,460 plants in the second year, 3,720 plants in the third year, 3,984 plants in the fourth year, 4,240 plants in the fifth year, 4,500 plants in the sixth year, 4,760 plants in the seventh year, 5,020 plants in the eighth year, 5,380 plants in the ninth year, and 5,540 plants in the tenth year, totaling 43,700 plants. After that, 3,200 plants will be replanted and changed each year. As for its cost budget, according to the planting experience of the Engineering Bureau, including the cost of digging trees, packaging, transportation, digging holes, planting, and setting up new supports, it costs about one yuan to plant one tree. According to the previous ten years, the cost required for planting each year is 43,700 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Buick Ice Racing Record Ji Ren <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Speeding at 100 Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>Winning the Mack's Silver Cup</p>
<p>Unprecedented Record</p>
<p>The north is bitterly cold, and ice skating is popular. This type of game is no longer very timely. New-style ice skating sports are now all replaced by car ice racing. The city of Nufo Shi Gao Tuo in Setterney, Canada, holds an ice race every year. This year, the winner of the Mack Ayatt Silver Cup was still the ice racer Dick Luo Ji and his company.</p>
<p>Every winter, the harbor surface accumulates ice a foot thick, which is firm and smooth, making it a natural runway. When the competition is held, men and women from the city and countryside rush to visit. The road to Shanyin is endless with traffic. The area is the most famous speedway in the world, and the results of each competition often break global records.</p>
<p>This year, Luo Ji and his company drove a new Buick racing car to join the competition, setting an unprecedented record. The runway was a saltwater river surface, starting from Edward and ending at Setterney. They sped away, with an average speed of 105.88 miles per hour, that is, 2.5 miles per minute and a half. At the fastest time, it could increase to more than 110 miles per hour.</p>
<p>As a result, the first to reach the finish line was Luo Ji and his company, driving a Buick, about three-quarters of a mile away from the second racing car. The speed was unprecedented. The audience was amazed. It is said that Luo Ji and his company have won the championship four times, especially this time is the most glorious. Buick racing cars are used in every competition, and victory is guaranteed. Today, people call Luo Ji and his company the King of Ice.</p>
<p>A wedge-shaped wind deflector is added in front of the Buick car box of Luo Ji and his company to reduce the resistance of the wind. The gear ratio is also changed to suit the highest speed. Therefore, the engine of this Buick is specially equipped and is different from ordinary machines.</p>
<p>The Mack Ayatt Silver Cup Race is one of the most valuable events in Canadian sports. Each time, the audience is crowded and extremely enthusiastic. During the competition, there must be a security team to strictly protect the crowd from crowding into the runway to avoid danger. The players have their own factions to support them, forming teams and shouting to encourage them. The fanaticism is beyond description. There are even those who gamble on this in the field, with varying amounts and huge wins and losses. During this year's competition, one or two players were jealous of Luo Ji and his company's skills, and a small number of latecomers requested a rematch. Luo Ji and his company generously agreed. As a result, he finally won the first place. It can be seen that Buick's contribution to the winners is definitely not comparable to ordinary vehicles.</p>
<p>On the day of the competition, the ice was very thick, and the wind was smooth, so the speed of each car was faster. Gordon Ilmen drove a light Chevrolet racing car, and the speed per hour could also reach 80 miles, and he finally won the fourth place.</p>
<p>This time, the speed of each car was really amazing to the audience. It is incomprehensible to be able to control the smooth ice surface at such a fast speed. After detailed inspection, it was found that the tires of each car were equipped with wide-headed short needles. When the wheels rotate, the needle tips stretch and contract from time to time. Even if the speed is increased to the extreme, there is no risk of overturning.</p>
<p>The next day, there was an unofficial competition. The ice suddenly melted one or two inches, and the deep part became almost a pool. When each car drove past, the ice flowers flew up like a heavy rain. The players and the audience could not avoid it, and their whole bodies were wet, which was comparable to after a shower. But in an instant, the car had gone several miles away, which is unimaginable. It is also an interesting story.</p>

<p>28,000 Visitors in 1929</p>
<p>According to what Mr. Honisbao, the manager of the Studebaker Car Factory, said, last year, the situation of people visiting the car factory set up by Studebaker in SOUTHBEND was unprecedented. In a year, people from far and near came to visit the factory, with a total of more than 2,000 people. It is a remarkable thing that there were representatives from 22 countries. Since the establishment of the factory, there have never been so many visitors. The number of people visiting the factory from all over the United States was 27,799, including 19,654 from Indiana, Illinois, and the interior, including 387 students. Those who came to visit the factory from the University of Zidan were there to visit the engineering in the factory. There were 119 people who came from Masari Province, and 232 from California. There were also many visitors from other places such as Michigan, Iowa, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. As for foreigners, there were 129 people, representing almost all countries in the world, from all over the Far East, such as Japan, India, Siam, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Honolulu, and Brazil, Peru, and Canada, Cuba, South America, Central America, Mexico, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, England, Switzerland, and the Panama Canal. The factory welcomes all visitors very much. Every Saturday and Sunday, special cars are opened to welcome visitors, and there are uniformed receptionists to guide the visitors in the factory. The buses opened by the factory travel back and forth from the main factory to the branch factory, and can be reached in two hours each time.</p>
