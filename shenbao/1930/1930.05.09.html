<p>世界政爭至不得已時。每有人倡提携之説。然提携而能成功者。必兩黨本無甚極端利害衝突。或一黨已至勢窮力竭。不得已而屈伏就和。倘若所爭旣爲兩黨生死關頭且立於主要地位。兩黨之勢力。又均未用盡。而爲顧全國家大局。寗犧牲一黨權利以誠意提携者。吾未之見也。英自由黨與工黨提携雖云顧全大局。然自由黨與工黨。本非立於極端相反之地位。德國權黨與政府黨提携。雖云犧牲成見。然亦起於國權黨内部之不和。且與政府黨亦無甚惡感。故英德兩國政黨之提携。容易實現。若日本民政兩黨之情勢。則大異乎是。</p>
<p>日本之民政兩黨。旣立於對峙之地位。而其權利上之衝突。則有深仇夙恨不與俱存之情勢。此次統帥權之。爭本非無調解餘地。其所以相持至於如此者。非統帥權問題之無法解决。實民政兩黨之爭。根本上無法解决。也縱今日統帥權問題。費千鈞調和之力。而幸免於破裂。然不旋踵又將借他問題以發生。提携又豈能久。自提携説起。民政黨之幹部曰。政友會台能改變現在之態度。以至誠請携手者。本黨自無拒絶之。理政友會之幹部曰。濱口首相而要求提携者。吾黨亦願就之。兩方之口脗如此。試問有絲毫提携之誠意乎。然非僅日本之政爭如此。凡世界政爭而有極端利害關係者。無不如此。提携之説。亦政爭至無可奈何時應有之一曲折而。已</p>

<p>撞破船頭新豐輪自上星期五從紫竹林開出、行至將近大沽口之蔡家港河面、適過大沽駁船公司之鐵駁兩艘、滿裝汽油、由小火輪拖進白河、新豐輪依準航道而行、而迎面行來之兩鐵駁、其在最後之一艘因帶纜折斷、而船身便橫、一時無法停留乃向新豐船頭猛撞、及新豐欲避、而已不及、致左船頭艙撞成一大洞海水即進船内幸該處爲水艙、致貨物尙未受損、但船已不能出海、急即退回塘沽修理、</p>

<p>一雙兩好安徽合肥人季小順子、年二十六歲、賃居浦東東昌路餘德里二十一號門牌、現在陸家嘴英美烟廠爲小工、月得工資十五元、妻殷氏、名林弟、海州人、年華二九、貎頗娟好、於去年四月間成婚、殷氏前在日華紗廠做工、後因病停工、並未生育、夫婦間平日感情尙稱不惡、</p>
<p>生活問題近來季以生活程度頗高、所入不豐、生計難以維持、故往其胞兄小五子家中、商議節省開支之法、兄嫂均勸小順子貼資寄飯其家、不必單獨生活、以省費用、小順子聞言、頗爲滿意、回家與妻磋商、不料殷氏大爲反對、季見妻拒絶上項辦法、異常憤懣、致夫婦間頓起勃谿、而季此後日必獨往史嫂家飯食、殷氏以無資生活、亦借食於附近母家、日前因是項問題爭執、夫婦間又起衝突、慘劇因之驟生、</p>
<p>抱屍大慟殷氏以不服丈夫主見、致觸夫怒、一時氣憤塡胸、突於前日傍晚五時、乘夫工作尙未返家之時、入房懸樑自縊、移時適有二房東婦人某氏返家、見臥房緊閉、心疑有異、力推不開、即喚集鄰家將房門移開、則見殷氏空懸樑上、一時恐惶失措、立即馳報伊母兄到來、將殷氏放下、則早已氣絶身死、挽救無術、不久小順子亦工畢歸來、見驟生慘劇、抱住妻尸大慟、旋被三區警署傅去訊問、</p>
<p>母家糾葛殷氏死後、伊母殷許氏、兄殷步康、堅指小順子虐辱逼死、聲稱欲往法庭起訴伸寃、小順子方自三區歸來、即被扭住爭吵、後由小順子之兄小五子出而調解、承認對於死者從豐收殮、並雇道士做公德爲之超度、死者母家、始無異議、允於昨日狀請法院免騐、不料昨晨小順子不徵岳家同意、購一棺柩來家、而伊岳母許氏認爲該棺木料不佳、堅欲調換不果、隔宵談判、又告决裂、</p>
<p>毆辱地保昨晨、有二十四保二十四圖地保謝阿龍、前往調查、擬報地方法院相騐、不料到塲時、死者母家不識爲地保、責令不得聲張、謝爲之辯論、致被告輩兇毆兩拳謝以無端被毆、於理不合、更未聞有尸屬毆辱地保之事、故往三區報告、即由該區派警將屍兄步康帶區、解送地方法院訊究、旋即和解了事、</p>
<p>今日相騐同時該地保即具狀請求派員渡浦相騐、該院本定下午委派檢察官檢騐員蒞騐、嗣以爲時過晏不及、改於今日上午九時、再行到塲檢騐、故屍身昨晚仍未收殮入棺、</p>

<p>（五）上海標金投機家之勢力</p>
<p>國内情形國際償付及東匯二原因而外、又有一重要相匹之勢、在即標金之投機是也、上海標金價格、可依東匯或倫敦大條銀或他項原因则變動、但有時其變動完全不受任何海外市塲之影響、而絶對的根據中國國内情形、及國内投機界之心理、上二月間、標金價格之變動、即屬此類、此外如英日間套價（Crossrate）及日美間套價、對於標金標金價格之變動、亦有相當勢力、惟其然也、故對於上海銀匯、亦且相當勢力、申言之、即投機者每依上列套價而作其標金之交易是也、</p>
<p>（六）近來銀匯變遷之原因</p>
<p>至此、我等可以進察控制上海銀匯之勢力矣、溯自二月間匯兑風潮發端以來、標金價格及其背方之銀匯變動錯亂異常、第一、先有印度美國等之徵收現銀進口税、及印度安南收下之不用通幣之傾注等種種謠言、嗣後又有海外各國政府實際上對付現銀政策之實施、凡此種種、皆與此間標金市面之破壞有關、最近又有中國政府限制現銀入口之謠傳影響標金市面、均此現象、除以投機原理解釋之之外、絶無其他原理可以理喻、</p>
<p>（七）銀匯暴跌複式原理之發明</p>
<p>總括言之、上海銀滙、係受國際償付、東匯、標金投機、倫敦大條銀價、及其他許多無形勢力所影響、此類勢力之中、除國際償付一端外、餘皆可以投機一項包括之、由原理上言、上海銀匯、係受國際償付原理及投機原理二項所節制、但因二者之中、後者之影響、最近卓著、故此次滙兑現象、可純以後者一端解釋之、除此以外之理由、著者深信其全屬無用、反易引起錯誤結果抑有進者、此複式之投機原理、在中國金融制度未加改革以前、不但適用於過去與現在、而且適用於將來也、</p>
<p>（丁）救濟聲中之方案</p>
<p>金本位問題明係上海銀匯變動之原因、則進謀補救之策、已非難事論者多漠言惟金本位制度足以補救一切困難、但著者絶不信此策之能救濟時艱、而且信其將激增目下之風潮、</p>
<p>（一）金本位問題</p>
<p>依原則上言、中國幣制之應切實加以整頓、無庸非議、但金本位政策之實施尙非其時、現今國人貧困已極、更不堪重受其改革過渡時期以内之痛苦與犧牲、在一政治未淸明經濟落後之國家、採取金本位制、必將使現狀更加混亂、而引起新幣制在國内外之狂暴伸縮、阿根廷·巴西·智利·比魯·以及其他南美各國、蓋皆身歷其境况者也、即以歐戰期内、及戰後英法德俄之經騐而論、亦可明瞭諸金用國間匯兑平價之可以擾亂、一九二三年地震以後之日金、更予我人以一滙兑複雜現象之敎訓、總之、在我國未有充分準備對付一切困難之前、堅持金本位方策者、實屬妄誕、至以金本位制度爲一幣制政策、則當别論、　　（未完）</p>

<p>波斯。亦東方之古國也。地瀕紅海。與阿拉伯爲隣。迄乎今日。猶未盡脱游牧人種之風習。</p>
<p>厥俗有名鬥瓜者。至爲有趣。每年於秋收以後。奉行鬥瓜大而至於都會。小而至於村莊。俱有鬥瓜會之組織。以爲娛樂。但其中亦稍稍含有賭博意味。與歐美之賽馬相似　舉行鬥瓜子前。由主其事者擇定適中之地點及時日。佈告於大衆。一届開幕之際。場中置一桌。桌上置一瓜。隨人下注。以紅瓤白瓤兩門爲限。猜中者獲厚奬。否則徒呼負負而已。俟衆人下注旣定之後。始由主其事者執刃剖瓜。以示瓜瓤之紅白。</p>
<p>在波斯人視之。此乃相傳之一種娛樂。顧有因之而暴富者。固不乏其人。而因以傾家蕩產者。亦實繁有徒。事屬娛樂。跡近賭博。聞現在波斯政府。擬加禁止云。</p>
<p>此次浙江移民出關。開東南各省墾荒殖邊之先例。第一批三百十五人。已乘華陽輪出發。運送員中之胡儒引君。在關外二十餘年。辦理鐵路土木工程於東北情形甚稔。浙當司請其同往。誠爲謀移民之幸福也。據胡君爲余言東北天產之富。某國侵佔之烈。聞之殊令人驚悚。今略紀一二如下</p>
<p>三百元變成四十萬胡君言。渠在東省識一魯人某。帶三百元至奉。今已有四十萬元。成一大富翁矣。某弟兄三人。在本省不能生存。乃變產售屋併凑三百元出關。以二百元作一年之食用。以一百元領地一方。（東省地以方計每方四百八十畝）用驢馬三匹匹弟兄三人。親自開墾。一年以後。即成生產之地。每畝田價便値二十元。彼再將此墾熟之田。向大地主抵借二千元‘續領二十方。繼續用此墾一方。抵領若干方。至去年弟兄三人。因出關已滿十載。盤查所得。達四十餘萬元。現已三股分派。儼然三個富翁矣。</p>
<p>興安嶺遍地是黃金東省興安嶺。爲中國金礦之區。遼寗當局已派鄒作華前往開墾。胡君研土木專科。據稱渠親往興安嶺沙區内實地調查。將沙淘鍊。中含赤金甚多。當地土民。亦有在該處淘金者。惜提鍊泥古。工巨而得金徵。若能投巨資。辦新法淘金機。則遍地黃金。取用不竭。今鄒督辦已在計劃云。</p>
<p>天然碱塊俯拾即是上海卜内門之洋碱銷售我國。每年何慮數百萬金。而東三省之洋碱。竟多如糞土。隨地皆是。該處居氏。平日不務地項工作。日往產碱地區拾取此天然碱塊。每一小兒可拾二千文。成人可拾三千文。因此養成此輩人民之懶性。近日日英各國爭往廉價收買。而國人轉有不知此項出產者。</p>
<p>雜糧出產額之可驚呼海鐵路僅占三縣之地界。全綫不過二百公里。胡君在該路任事較久。謂鐵路營業全恃裝運荳粟麥高梁。而運費極賤。然每年可收水脚六百萬元。則此三縣雜糧產額之巨。實可驚人。然猶有十分之五六。尙未開發種植也　　滿鐵收入駭人聽聞南滿鐵道。現在每日之收入。已達三十八萬元。一月即有一千一百四十萬元。而一年即可收一萬三千六百八十萬元。此項金錢之出於華人所納者。占十分之九以上。其歷年漏出之金錢。正不知若干矣。沿路又設立學校。專收中國十五歲以内之學生。免費讀書。國人受其愚貪其利者。均將子弟送入。而所授均日本文。一届畢業。便數典忘祖。不啻爲日人造無數侵犯中國之日本化的中國人。其計劃更可驚人也。</p>

<p>致富之道多矣。然未聞以求乞而致富也。詎我松有丐婦焉。因求乞而致富。事出離奇。因將其致富情形。略述於左</p>
<p>丐婦某。不知其名。松人也。年已耳順。家道赤貧。早寡。而子復不肖。無法謀生。乃以求乞爲活。日必守候於馬路橋邊。向來往過客。哀哀求乞。蓋馬路橋爲松江脚划船碼頭。且至西車站搭車。亦爲必經之道。故旅客往來。頗爲熱閙。客之過馬路橋者。婦必尾之而行。出其懸河之口。滔滔向之求乞。務使探囊而後他去。回憶我輩在外求學之日。每回松時。必見婦在馬路橋邊向人求乞也。婦性頗吝。自奉甚儉。每日求乞所得。除購買饅頭素麵等物。以自充飢而外。餘錢必聚而蓄之。初。婦固未知求乞亦能致富也。詎金錢之爲物。能積少成多。且婦之積錢。滿一銀元之後。即貸諸他人。每月得一角之利。年可獲一元二角。子多於母。即所謂印子錢也。如是盤剥。不數年而婦之手中。已有銀元數百。然求乞之業。婦仍未嘗棄之也久而久之。積錢愈多。九流三敎。江湖浪蕩。遇有拮据時。必向之借貸。而婦則莫不應之。一時我松人士。莫不知婦之有錢。街頭巷口。傳爲美談婦除貸錢之外。並以餘下之錢。購備壽衣壽物。以作身後之用。奈其子爲無業游民之一。至不堪度日時。必潛至家中。將婦之金錢壽衣。私行偷竊。婦旣發覺。必仰天痛哭。其狀頗悲。如是者數四。然婦亦無可如何。且以愛子心切。不願使其入獄也。今則馬路橋邊。已無婦之踪跡。生耶否耶。不得而知之矣</p>

<p>第三十八章十九世紀法蘭西的散文</p>
<p>見而且歌正和邪的人、</p>
<p>現在統制了一切的歌鍵的人、</p>
<p>｜斯文本「微克忒囂俄」</p>
<p>有如叙述十七世紀的英吉利抒情詩人的當兒、我所試説過似的、詩的派别或式型是使凡有試要劃出確定的線來的人們困惑那樣地互相融合着、我們不能説甲派在何處終結、乙派在何處開始、十九世紀（及數年前及數年後）的法蘭西詩極不顯明地别爲羅曼派和高蹈派和家徵派這三羣、在英吉利和法蘭西兩者的羅曼派、（在這兩國的運動是不可思議模樣酷似着、而也相異的、）在形式上、又在内容上脱離了桎梏的因襲、爲求主材而往過去、往自已的靈魂的深處、並且往星、放鬆了拍加薩斯的　　、高蹈派則反抗羅曼派的放縱、和個人底哀聲和擺侖底主我主義、努力使詩成爲客觀底·非個人底·「非人情底」並不像大理石似的堅冷、却像美的塑像似的純潔堅實而淸楚、這是甚至將莎士比亞及但丁也看做「粗俗」的新古典主義、其次出現了主張個人底東西主張歌自已的必要、又主張誠實地行别的什麽事爲不可能的象徵主義者、他們的批評底發言者、里米得龔古爾云、人爲寫文章唯一所有的口實便在表現自已自身的人格、這三派和幾個附屬的分派、（據説法蘭西是每隔十五年便有一個新的詩派的、）並非在根柢上互相敵對或挑斥、因爲究竟詩總是詩、高蹈派的最大的人物勒空得利爾、是正同魏倫在他一流是個人底一樣、在他一流是個人底的、高蹈派説着、且實行着形式的美·音響的美、魏倫的最大的標語是、「音樂先於其他什麽」、表現自已的心情和心氣、憑了暗示而將自已的感情和感覺傳逵於讀者的象徵主義者、確然是没有和初期的羅曼主義者什麽可爭之處的、譬如拉馬丁在「湖」「在寂境」中豈不也是這麽辦的麽、倘説高蹈派有幾點和小説上的寫實主義者相似、則羅曼斯和寫實主義間的劃線在那裹、這一個古舊的問題又復發生了、然而對於現代的詩人呢、我們試要决定那此詩人坐於流派中的什麽交椅上、就不會十分理解他們的、</p>
<p>法蘭西詩的羅曼底運動、儘能指出確然的開端來的限度、是開始於三十二歲時死於刑臺上的可驚的靑年詩人安得烈社内的、他從希臘及拉丁獲得了他的靈感、雖然羅曼主義者稱他爲先驅者、他實在是徹底的古典主義者、然而他的古典主義並不是衒學底的這並非借來物或意識底地經過研究的東西、却是他的本性的一部、是多實的古典主義、他的詩柔而且美因此羅曼主義者是稱他爲父的、他的有些詩、倘採入於希臘詩選中、該也相當的罷、</p>
<p>偉大的民謠詩人·兼且俗謠歌人貝龍熱、雖然他那雄勁的歌確乎不是和非常讚美他的羅曼底同代者不相調和的、却並不屬於羅曼主義的羣、而是全然孤立着的、他的歌或民謠、燦然輝耀、富於生彩·有巧妙的變化、語彙單純而誠實、律呂即不微妙也是可唱的、在那一類中、雖非最大却是完全的東西、像針指着拿破侖的這一首似的充溢昻然的精神的民謠是没有的了、</p>
<p>從前有伊佛多的王、</p>
<p>羅曼主義者的羣中最初偉大的詩人是拉馬丁、他那未嘗被以後自已的作品所超越的「瞑想」是法蘭西文學中决定底的書之一、這樣的旋律在十七世紀以後的法蘭西未經聽聞、這是自發的·淸新而純粹的東西、悲哀·毘連於感傷性的柔和的悲哀、「黃昏和記憶」的心氣是完全誠實的、他的感情的範圍有限、而他那細巧的色彩在囂俄及他的一派的壯重的絇爛之前、幾乎消褪到看不出來、然而後代的詩人及批評家以逐漸增在在的讚美的眼來看他了、這是毫無可疑的、他那最出名的詩是「湖」、從其中我來引莎利所翻譯的兩節罷、</p>

Next, the Turkish Chargé d'Affaires orally reported the suffering Turkey had experienced from unequal treaties, which was similar to China's experience, as well as the Turkish government's revision of unequal treaties with various countries, hoping that the Sino-Turkish treaty would also be based on the principles of equality and reciprocity, or based on the equal treaties that China and Turkey had already signed with various countries, without the need for much delay.

<h3 id="e22">The Theory of Cooperation Between the Two Parties in Japan's Ruling and Opposition Parties <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In the world of political struggles, the theory of cooperation is often proposed when it is unavoidable. However, the cooperation that can be successful must be when the two parties do not have extreme conflicts of interest, or when one party has reached the end of its strength and has no choice but to surrender and make peace. If the dispute is a matter of life and death for both parties and stands in a major position, and the strength of both parties has not been exhausted, and in order to take into account the overall situation of the country, they are willing to sacrifice the rights of one party to cooperate sincerely, I have never seen it. Although the cooperation between the British Liberal Party and the Labour Party is said to take into account the overall situation, the Liberal Party and the Labour Party are not in an extremely opposite position. Although the cooperation between the German National Party and the government party is said to sacrifice prejudices, it also originated from the internal discord of the National Party and has no ill feelings towards the government party. Therefore, the cooperation between political parties in Britain and Germany is easy to achieve. The situation of the two parties, the Minseito and Seiyukai, in Japan is very different.</p>
<p>The Minseito and Seiyukai in Japan are in a confrontation position, and their conflicts of interest have the situation of deep hatred and irreconcilable differences. This time, the dispute over the command of the military is not without room for mediation. The reason why it has persisted to such an extent is not that the problem of command of the military cannot be solved, but that the dispute between the two parties, the Minseito and Seiyukai, is fundamentally unsolvable. Even if the problem of command of the military is spared from rupture by the force of reconciliation, it will soon arise again with other problems. How can cooperation last long? Since the theory of cooperation began, the cadres of the Minseito said: If the Seiyukai can change its current attitude and sincerely ask to cooperate, this party will not refuse it. The cadres of the Seiyukai said: If Prime Minister Hamaguchi asks for cooperation, our party is willing to accept it. The words of both sides are so insincere. Is there the slightest sincerity of cooperation? However, it is not only the political struggle in Japan that is like this. All world political struggles with extreme interests are like this. The theory of cooperation is just a twist that should exist when political struggles are unavoidable.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zuobin telegraphed a certain important person of the National Government on the seventh, saying that the Times published a declaration by Soviet Russia on the fifth, stating roughly that Yan had officially declared friendship with Soviet Russia, and had cooperated with Feng and Wang to reorganize the party headquarters and organize the government. Mo Dehui was fully authorized by Yan to hold the Sino-Russian Conference, and there must be good results. The relationship between China and Russia is gradually improving, etc. Judging from the tone, it seems that they still want to use dual diplomacy. Diplomatic circles believe that Mo Dehui is a representative formally appointed by the Central Government and has never been commissioned by Yan. The declaration issued by Russia is nothing more than wanting to use dual diplomacy to achieve its manipulative purpose. (Eighth Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications stated that the postage for parcels sent to various bureaus in Northern Manchuria was originally charged an additional simple fee of one time the stipulated fee. Later, due to competition from Japanese postal services, parcels from Changchun, Xiatai, Yingcheng, Tumenling, Huapichang, Jilin, and other six places were designated as special districts, and the simple fee of one time was stopped. Recently, merchants and residents, seeing that the postage in the district was particularly cheap, sent parcels destined for Harbin and other places to Changchun by post, and then handed them over to a transport company for re-delivery in order to gain advantages, which seriously affected postal revenue. The special district method has been cancelled, and the postage for parcels sent to Changchun and other six places will still be handled in accordance with the methods of other bureaus in Northern Manchuria to make it uniform.

<p>All Liquor Stores in the City Burned</p>
<p>Police Open Fire, Suppression Ineffective</p>
<p>Resulting in 25 Deaths and 100 Injuries</p>
<p>Reuters, Swarajapur, Bombay Province, 8th: Serious riots occurred here today, resulting in 25 deaths and 100 injuries. Six county courthouses of the Police Bureau and all the liquor stores in the city were burned. A detachment of troops from the Ahmadiya faction is on its way here. Another telegram stated that the unrest yesterday was caused by factory workers announcing a strike and organizing a parade. At the same time, pickets were stationed in front of all the liquor stores. Protesters clashed with police at a certain location and then set fire to the liquor stores, leaving only one intact. The situation was very serious. A total of twenty-two local Indian auxiliary soldiers were called in, and things gradually calmed down in the evening. However, at 11:00 AM this morning, several volunteers clashed with the police again while trying to stop the felling of a palm tree. The county magistrate tried to persuade the crowd to disperse, but they refused, so he ordered the police to open fire. The entire town is now in chaos. As of 2:00 PM this afternoon, gunfire had not stopped. The police were gradually forced back by the mob, and two of them were killed. The auxiliary army ordered the conscription of other troops because their forces were insufficient to suppress the unrest.</p>

<p>London News: Londoners are greatly shaken by the news of instability among Indian troops in North-West India. According to expert observation, the Indian army, with the exception of the Gurkha troops (i.e., a tribe of Nepal) and some special units, can no longer be relied upon. They had warned the authorities, but the authorities did not heed them. A portion of the Labor Party vigorously opposes the current policy of oppression in India, with daily propaganda lamenting the actions of official circles and stating, "History is full of tragic warnings.

<p>Egyptian Representatives Return Home Today</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th: Anglo-Egyptian negotiations took place at the Foreign Office and continued for 19 consecutive hours until 3:15 AM this morning, when both sides paused to rest. Meetings resumed at 11:00 AM and at 12:45 PM in the afternoon, it was announced that negotiations had broken down and no date had been set for future meetings. It is expected that the Egyptian representatives will depart for home tomorrow. Today, the Egyptian representatives stated that they would never sign a treaty that would relinquish Sudan. Regarding the breakdown of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations, the Foreign Office has not issued a statement. According to authorities, both sides were in a very friendly spirit at the end of the meeting and the door to continued negotiations remains open.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 7th: A London telegram states that Anglo-Egyptian representatives were still not in agreement while drafting the treaty today. The point of contention is likely the Sudan question. After a partial compromise yesterday, negotiations resumed early at 8:00 AM this morning, with a short break for lunch. The British Foreign Secretary, without having lunch, attended a cabinet meeting and then requested a private conversation with the Egyptian chief representative, Nahas. Nahas refused, telling others the content of the conversation, and his expression seemed uneasy. It was decided to hold a full meeting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Ruling and Opposition Parties Cooperating</p>
<p>Situation in the House of Peers Deteriorates</p>
<p>Finance Minister Arrives in Harbin with Full Powers</p>
<p>Talks to Japanese Reporters</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: According to the Kokumin Shimbun, ruling and opposition parties have been cooperating to resolve the issue of supreme command. Depending on the outcome of internal negotiations, there is hope of concrete action. Among the younger members of the House of Peers, there are also plans to take this opportunity to clarify where the responsibility of advisors lies. Regarding the talk of cooperation, Civil Administration Party Secretary-General Tomita said that if the Seiyukai changes its current attitude and sincerely asks to join hands for the sake of the nation, the Civil Administration Party will have no reason to refuse. Kiyose Ichiro said that he plans to discuss countermeasures for this important issue from a standpoint that transcends political parties. However, the Seiyukai should show magnanimity. The opinion of Seiyukai executives is that they must first unify the party's opinion. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi requests cooperation, the Seiyukai is also willing to respond and work to uphold the constitution.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi's vague answer to the question of Ikeada Chogoro in the House of Peers has worsened the situation in the House of Peers regarding the issue of supreme command. Jiji Press, Harbin, 8th: Finance Minister Zaibu and his party arrived here on the morning of the 8th and immediately entered their residence, where they secretly conferred with Deputy Adjutant Koga for about half an hour.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Manzhouli, 7th: Minister Zaibu, en route home as the plenipotentiary for disarmament, arrived in Manzhouli on the morning of the 7th. A Dentsu reporter went to the train to interview him. The plenipotentiary said, "The great undertaking of disarmament cannot be accomplished overnight. The London Naval Treaty, from the standpoint of national defense, may have unsatisfactory aspects, but considering domestic and foreign circumstances, it is considered beneficial to Japan, so it was signed. As for the issue of supreme command and the issue of the chief of the Naval General Staff's position on the emperor's staff, I am not familiar with the details and cannot express any opinion. However, the plenipotentiary's dedication and effort were extraordinary. As for my future, I have not yet considered anything. After returning home, I plan to consult with the government and my colleagues before deciding what to do."</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: With discussions in military circles regarding the issue of supreme command becoming increasingly loud, Minister Zaibu's return home will only intensify the situation. All the Tokyo newspapers today are commenting on it. The Jiji Shimpo said that military circles are eagerly awaiting the return of Minister Zaibu. As soon as he arrives in Beijing, a meeting of field marshals and military councilors will be held to inquire about the truth of the imperial rescript and discuss everything in detail, which may lead to significant consequences. The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun said that if the government states that the issue of army troop strength is purely a matter of military administration, then Minister of the Army Ugaki will have no choice but to resign. The government's evasion of answering questions about the issue of supreme command is also indicative of this. The Navy also expressed dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Hamaguchi's answer. Therefore, the government held a cabinet meeting in the Diet yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo said that the issue of concessions on disarmament may reignite after Minister Zaibu returns home. Prime Minister Hamaguchi is inquiring about the opinions of Marshals Uehara and Yamamoto to guard against the deterioration of the situation. U.S. Senate</p>

<p>Likely to Trigger a Political Crisis</p>
<p>National Society, Brussels, 7th: Last year, a sergeant named Lee Yu in the Belgian army, a resident of the Flanders region, was arrested and has been awaiting court-martial ever since for disobeying the orders of a superior officer who issued commands in French, claiming that he did not understand French. Now, this case is likely to trigger a political crisis because the feelings between the Flemish-speaking people and the French-speaking people are deteriorating daily. This case has attracted national attention. Yesterday, a Flemish-speaking member of parliament demanded in parliament that the government drop the case, but the Minister of the Army refused, claiming that the law requiring superior officers to use the local language when addressing Flemish-speaking soldiers was only promulgated this year, while this case occurred last year, so it must proceed according to the old law. As a result, the Flemish member of parliament threatened to move to impeach the government, and opposition parties said they would vote in favor of the motion.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Talk by the Central Propaganda Department <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a talk with news reporters at 2:00 PM on the 8th in the Central Second Conference Hall. More than twenty reporters from various newspapers attended. Zhang Tingxi presided, respectfully read the last will, and Zhang reported that recently, the reactionary authorities in the North stated that the Ta Kung Pao was supported by the Central Government and severely criticized the newspaper. The newspaper has officially declared that the reactionary authorities in the North insulted the personality of news reporters with despicable psychology, which is not only laughable but also worthless. Next, Wang Zhengting reported that regarding the return of Weihaiwei and the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, some outsiders may not be fully clear about the details, so the following is specially listed as a report: (1) Regarding the issue of the return of Weihaiwei, the United Kingdom sent representatives at the Washington Conference, intending to return it to China immediately. At the same time, it also stated that after the return, it should be lent to the British Navy for use as a summer resort. At that time, the Chinese government appointed Liang Ruhai to negotiate a chapter with the British representatives, but there were still some inappropriate points in the content. Liu Gong Island was allowed to be used for ten years, and after ten years, it could continue to be borrowed. If China had no special reason, it could not reject their request. Later, when Gu Shaochuan was Minister of Foreign Affairs, he again negotiated with the British side, and as a result, the opinions were divided into two: one formal treaty, which was to be borrowed for ten years, and the other was an exchange, stipulating that it could continue to be borrowed after ten years. This kind of method can be said to be the same medicine in a different bottle, so the dispute was long and fruitless. Last year, when I (Wang Zhengting) negotiated with Lampson, I paid special attention to this point and expressed that if the British side showed goodwill to us, they should abolish this agreement. Although Lampson expressed deep agreement at the time, the British government was still unwilling to give up. After repeated negotiations, it was finally decided that only a part of Liu Gong Island would be borrowed. Although it could be borrowed for ten years, it could only be renewed after ten years with China's consent. In addition, at any time, if the Chinese side wanted to designate all of Weihaiwei as a military port, all British merchants' private property on the mainland there had to be evacuated and China would recover it at a fair value. At the same time, the British consulate there also had to be evacuated. With this point, the British proposal to borrow Liu Gong Island as a summer resort can also be implicitly canceled. In addition, previous treaties often opened up commercial ports in the nature of treaties, but this time this point was not mentioned, which is also noteworthy. The above are the main points of this signing of the Weihaiwei agreement, and are specially presented as a report. (2) Regarding the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, some outsiders say that China's tariffs have already been independent, so why is it necessary to sign an agreement again? This statement seems right but is not. The so-called independence is that all countries except Japan have recognized our country's independence, but Japan has no basis for this because the treaty has expired. And from a legal point of view, acquiescence and recognition are by no means the same. If this agreement is not signed, it cannot be said to be formally recognized. As for the agreement signed this time, it is stated to be a part of the trade treaty, and there are some differences in the diplomatic foothold. Japan has delayed this matter for a long time, which has caused great losses to our country. Until recently, the marine and land trade tax rates were decided to be 1/4 lower than the customs tax for goods imported by land. It is found that there are four countries that trade with our country by land: French Annam, British Burma, Russian Northwest Siberia, and Japanese Korea. Russia has abandoned it, and Britain also abandoned it when the tariff agreement was signed the year before last. France also abandoned it three months after signing the agreement, on March 31 of last year. Japan also recognizes this time that it will abandon it four months after the signing of the agreement, and thereafter the marine and land tax rates will be completely the same. In addition, the item on reciprocity is based on the principles previously set by our country, and the types have been reduced by four-fifths, and the time limit has also been shortened. Not only has the tax rate not been reduced, but it can also be increased by 25%. After the expiration, our country can still freely increase it. In addition, some people believe that when the Sino-Japanese tariff issue is resolved, the Chinese side will recognize the Nishihara loans. I (Wang Zhengting) am fully responsible for declaring that this is not the case, and the Chinese side has decided to convene a meeting of creditors before October of this year. In the future, for the debts borrowed, if they are indeed used for legitimate purposes, they will be recognized. Otherwise, they will not be recognized. This kind of sovereignty is completely in our hands, and foreigners may not interfere. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>Report on the Military Situation of Both Sides from the Shandong Provincial Government</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In recent days, due to the discovery of Shi Yousan's troops in western and northern Shandong, many rumors have inevitably arisen in the market. Chen Tiaoyuan, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, specially reported on the peaceful situation within the province's defense line at the provincial government's memorial week on the 5th to reassure the people. Chen stated briefly that although there have been various rumors in the market in recent days, there is absolutely no problem within the province's defense line. Bandits discovered in Feixian County have been defeated by the 1st Regiment of Chen Xiaosi's 2nd Garrison Brigade, led by Li Chaoying. Gao Guizi's troops in the Qingtuo Temple area of Yishui County are currently awaiting reorganization by Commander-in-Chief Ma Hongkui. The north bank of the Yellow River in the province will soon be pacified. Moreover, the people's armed forces in various counties are originally sufficient for self-defense. Unfortunately, a group of frustrated people in the province and a group of vacillating youths within the party colluded with foreign aid, resulting in the suffering of the people. The outcome of the meeting between Feng and Yan's generals in Luoyang originally scheduled a general offensive on May 1st, but it has not yet been launched. Our army has made proper arrangements in western Shandong and other places, waiting only for the central government's order to attack. However, from ancient times to the present, when a divided army fights against a united army, the united army has never failed to be defeated. Now, Feng and Yan are exclusively using miscellaneous troops, how can they succeed? In western Shandong, the strength of the provincial troops has exceeded Shi Yousan's troops by one and seven-tenths. If they dare to invade, they will be annihilated. The enemy troops on the Longhai Railway line are only Wan Xuancai and Sun Dianying's two divisions, totaling five divisions. The Northwest Army on the Pinghan Railway line claims to have 140,000 men, but only has 70,000 rifles. As a result of the meeting of Feng's lower-level generals in Zhengzhou, they are unwilling to advance eastward. A large part of the Jin Army in northern Shandong has withdrawn to Tanggu to defend against the Northeast. There are only two regiments in Dezhou. With the strength of our army, going straight to Tianjin and Beijing would be like entering an uninhabited land. Only when the time is right, there will be a solution. He hoped that all comrades would be at ease and work hard, etc. (May 5th)</p>

The meeting ended at 9 p.m. On the morning of the 7th, all members of the group took a small steamer across the river to Hanyang to visit the Arsenal and Iron Factory, where they were received by Deng Yancun, Director of the Arsenal, who guided them on a tour. They then went to the Hanyang Electric Light Company and the Zhou Hengshun Manufacturing Factory. They also scheduled to visit the Hankou Jiji Power Plant at 10 a.m. on the 8th, the Water Plant at 12 p.m., and the Fuxin Flour Mill at 2 p.m. in the afternoon. They planned to leave Hankou for Nanjing on the 9th, stay in Nanjing for a week to discuss construction plans with various departments, and then go from Nanjing to Shanghai, and then to Dalian, and then to the three northeastern provinces and Beiping for inspection. According to a member of the group who spoke to reporters, "We have come to China this time and inspected various factories in your country along the way, which is quite satisfactory. China still has such construction achievements at this time, and the future has unlimited hope. China and Germany have always been friendly, and Germany has developed industry earlier, but Germany cannot compare with China in terms of vast land and abundant resources. It is hoped that China and Germany will support each other and jointly seek industrial development, which is what Germans desire." (May 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e63">Deng Yingsheng Appointed Commander of the New 13th Division <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Commander's Office is Located in Ji'an, Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: The 16th Independent Brigade led by Deng Ying was originally under the command of Liu. Previously, Deng was engaged in suppressing bandits in the Ganjing Xinyu Yichun Jishui area and successively recovered Fenyi Yichun Yifeng Wanzai Gaoan and other counties. Liu considered that Deng's brigade had repeatedly achieved remarkable results in suppressing bandits and specially requested Chairman Chiang to expand the brigade into a division, with Deng being promoted to division commander. Chiang replied by telegram in winter, approving the request. Yesterday, Brigade Commander Deng also received a telegram from Liu Zhisheng from Xuzhou, appointing him as the commander of the newly编13th Division. The telegram read: "Urgent secret telegram to Deng Yingsheng, Commander of the 16th Independent Brigade, Jianhao Brother: The telegram from the Commander-in-Chief's Office in winter has been received. Deng Ying, Commander of the 16th Independent Brigade, is approved to be appointed as the commander of the newly編13th Division. The letter of appointment and official seal will be issued separately. I hope you will inform him and report on the new編情況, etc. I hereby telegram to comply with the order and hope you will take office and report as soon as possible. Liu Zhisheng Jiangping Seal." It is heard that the original編制 of Deng's brigade is not much different from the division headquarters. This time, it only needs to be slightly expanded to become a division. According to military sources, the three brigade commanders of the division will mostly be promoted from regimental commanders, and the regimental and battalion commanders will be promoted in turn. Deng himself is scheduled to take a Gan River steamer from the province to Zhangshu tomorrow (the 7th) to start the expansion. Once everything is ready, he will report his taking office. The division headquarters will be moved from Zhangshu to Ji'an because the overall headquarters for bandit suppression in the province has been moved from Ji'an back to Zhangshu. (May 6th)</p>

<p>Shen Jinshan, 20 years old, from Liuhe</p>
<p>The confession of bandit leader Zhang Zhaohua is as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Are you Gao Zian?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes.</p>
<p>(Question) Do you have any other names? Aren't you called Zhang Zhaohua?</p>
<p>(Answer) I don't have any other names. You are called Zhang Zhaohua, and I am called Gao Zian.</p>
<p>(Question) Is your injury better?</p>
<p>(Answer) It's better, but I can't sit up.</p>
<p>(Question) People say you are Zhang Zhaohua, and I am Gao Zian. Being here is enough to be shot.</p>
<p>(Question) What did you do before?</p>
<p>(Answer) I used to work in the army. In 1927, I worked under Qian Shusheng, the director of the Jiangsu Water Police Department. Later, Director Qian was transferred to be the Haizhou Salt Affairs Supervisor, and I left the Water Police Department. In 1928, I was a brother in the Suzhou Water Police. Later, I worked in the first district of Shanghai until I took leave last August and lived in Gaochang Temple in Shanghai. Later, I moved to No. 104 Peide Lane, Datong Road. Because I was robbed by bandits, I moved to the countryside. I still have a child, so I often come to the countryside to see him. I have returned to my hometown several times in February.</p>
<p>(Question) Why did you become a bandit?</p>
<p>(Answer) It's a long story. The people in Shanghai are complex, and the judge must know that. I didn't do anything. When I lived in Shanghai, I made bad friends who led me to this point. What else can I say today? As for this time, I arrived at Shen Dian Bridge from Shanghai on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the name of your secretary?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is said that there is a secretary named Shen Jinshan. He used to run an opium den in Shanghai. But may I ask the judge, who said he was my secretary? (The judge said it was Shen himself who said so) Since Shen himself said so, I can tell you about this person. He used to study at Baode District Elementary School. Later, he worked in a Shanghai coal company. When the coal company closed down, he opened an opium den in Zhaiyu Lane. I met him last December. As for saying that he is my secretary, that is not accurate. Because inside, he only keeps accounts. All the plans are still made by Mao Zilong.</p>
<p>(Question) How did you get to know Mao Zilong?</p>
<p>(Answer) I also met him in Shen Jinshan's opium den.</p>
<p>(Question) Was Mao Zilong also on the boat that day? Where is he now?</p>
<p>(Answer) He was still on the boat when the firing started that day. Later, I don't know where he escaped to.</p>
<p>(Question) If you can tell us and help us catch Mao Zilong, we can help you atone for your sins.</p>
<p>(Answer) It is very difficult to catch Mao Zilong. Now that he knows that the situation is not good, he has long since moved from his home. Where can I find him now? Even when I usually want to meet him, he still has three or four rooms set up in the hotel. His personnel are hard to meet, let alone today.</p>
<p>(Question) Where did your weapons come from?</p>
<p>(Answer) The weapons were shipped back from Shanghai separately. In total, the Haizhou gang has no more than ten ships and more than one hundred people. These one hundred people all have weapons. Outsiders say that the Haizhou gang has hundreds of people. This is not reliable. Mao Zilong and I are very good friends. Is there anything about him that I don't know?</p>
<p>(Question) Now there are many people who can prove that you are Zhang Zhaohua, and even Shen Jinshan can confront you. Why don't you say it?</p>
<p>(Answer) My real name is Zhang Peiyao.</p>
<p>(Question) Perhaps you have several aliases, and Zhaohua is another one of your aliases. You might as well say it. You are a very capable person. If you tell the truth, our commander-in-chief can employ you. In the future, you can atone for your sins and do something for the country. Wouldn't that be good?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are also people outside who acknowledge that I am called Zhang Peiyao. The reason why I took leave last year was because of my bad temper.</p>
<p>(Question) Perhaps it is because your ability is superb and you are unwilling to be under others for a long time, so you want to join the bandits and seek a way out. But why bury your heroism?</p>
<p>(Answer) But I am not exaggerating. Many brothers know my heart. I always advise them not to rape women or abuse the hostages they capture. People should have a conscience. Women are other people's wives. If we rape them, we will not only insult them but also cause discord between them and their husbands. As for kidnapping hostages, it is nothing more than wanting money. Why abuse them? When I tell these things to my brothers, they are very moved. It is true that bandits are bad people, but we cannot completely deny everything. Who says that bandits are all heartless bad guys?</p>
<p>(Question) Outsiders say that you are Zhang Zhaohua. Is there anyone else besides you who is called Zhang Zhaohua?</p>
<p>(Answer) No one else is called Zhang Zhaohua. If there is Zhang Zhaohua, it is me.</p>
<p>(Question) Then naturally you are Zhang Zhaohua without a doubt. How many gangs are there inside you?</p>
<p>(Answer) Only the Haizhou gang. The rest don't have much strength.</p>
<p>(Question) Aren't there also the Henan gang, the Pudong gang, and the Anhui gang?</p>
<p>(Answer) Although these names exist, the Henan gang doesn't interact with us. Their leader is Tian Kuaizi. But their strength is not as great as the Haizhou gang. The Anhui gang has been eliminated since Wu Dajin was taken away and executed. As for the Pudong gang, I have never heard of them. I don't know what they are like. However, although the Haizhou gang is stronger than the Henan gang, it doesn't have the advantage of the Henan gang's position. Because many of the Henan people farm in the Great Lake. They can be bandits or ordinary people.</p>
<p>(Question) What kind of person is Mao Zilong?</p>
<p>(Answer) He is the most useless good-for-nothing.</p>
<p>(Question) How is Tian Kuaizi compared to Mao Zilong? How many guns does he have?</p>
<p>(Answer) Tian Kuaizi is better than him, but he also smokes opium. He smokes three or four ounces a day and even chews opium dross. As for his guns, he only has a dozen or so. But because he has the Big Sword Society as a foundation, his strength is not weak. When his subordinates gather, you can say there are hundreds of them. When they are dispersed, you can say there is not a single one because they are all farming in Taihu.</p>
<p>(Question) Are the four gangs commanded together?</p>
<p>(Answer) No, only each gang comes to help the Haizhou gang.</p>
<p>(Question) Shen Jinshan himself said that he is your secretary. Why do you say that he is just an accountant? (At this point, Shen was brought to the court. When Shen saw Zhang Zhaohua, he said, "Brigade Commander, you are here too." He said to the judge, "He is our Brigade Commander Zhang Zhaohua." Zhang then said to Shen, "I am the Brigade Commander, who are you?" Shen replied, "I am the secretary. Brigade Commander, we are people who do things with our heads held high. Even if we are arrested today, why should we hide it?" Zhang asked, "I don't know that you are the secretary. What kind of secretary are you? But I don't know who appointed me as the Brigade Commander. Who appointed us? You say it first." Shen replied, "We were appointed by the Reorganization Faction. Our mission is to accept the command of the Reorganization Faction." Zhang confessed, "But I must declare that after Shen Jinshan and I arrived on the boat, we never robbed anything, nor did we rape women, kill anyone, or set fires. We are confident of this." (The official asked) "Who from the Reorganization Faction contacted you?" (Answer) "Commander-in-Chief Xu, Commander-in-Chief Bai, and Ju Zheng. They all sent representatives several times indirectly to contact us." (Question) "Who were the representatives they sent to talk to you?" (Answer) "A certain Gao, from Haizhou." (Question) "Do you know Chen Tian (also known as Chen Shiqing) and Yan Fuchen? They are the commanders of the Fourth Detachment of the National Salvation Army." (Answer) "I don't know them and I don't recognize them." (Question) "How were you arrested that day?" (Answer) "When the firing started that day, I came out with three people because the bullets were exhausted and we couldn't continue firing. So we each escaped. We hired a small boat to Tianjing. We all slept in the cabin. The person rowing went directly to Tianjing Street. He went ashore to report that bandits had come. We got up and rowed the boat ourselves. Then came thirty or forty public security officers and opened fire on us. We rowed to Weiting and went to the homes of ordinary people to look for rice and boiling water. They all said they didn't have any. We went to a cave. The next day, before dawn, the public security officers came again and called us out of the cave. So the public security officers escorted us to Weiting, and then from Weiting to Suzhou." (Question) "Where were you injured?" (Answer) "I was injured on the boat while rowing." (Question) "How did you become a gang in the beginning?" (Answer) "Because I made bad friends in Shanghai, the people from Haizhou all called me to the lake. They said that there were so many brothers that we could form an army. So I came with them. A gentleman regrets before, a small man regrets after. I am just a small man, so I regret it today. I shouldn't have been with those bad guys." (Question) "It is said that you were completely exploited by the Reorganization Faction and lured by bad people to this point." (Answer) "However, I can't completely wrong others. I did it myself, so I will take responsibility myself. Why should I resent others? However, I ask the judge, they all followed me. Let me take responsibility for everything alone. There is no need to harm them. Just shoot me. We are also people who do things. I also ask the judge, please don't see us as bandits. We die for our cause. Our death is worthwhile. If you insist that we are bandits, we will not rest in peace even in death." (Shen Jinshan also made the same request: "Judge us as political prisoners. Don't punish us as bandits," etc.)</p>

<p>Supplementary election of standing committee members of the Xinzhuang Chamber of Commerce: Lv Shouhe, the standing committee member of the Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce, was formerly vacant due to illness. Later, due to the occurrence of doubts, a request was submitted to the provincial government for interpretation. Wang Zhaoyun, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, has now scheduled a supplementary election on May 15th in accordance with the regulations. He has sent a letter to the district party headquarters and requested the county government to send personnel to supervise the election at that time in order to show solemnity.</p>
<p>Continuation of the Wang kidnapping case: After the theft and assault on Wang Ziqin's family in the eleventh map of Tianmashan, the detective team arrested the two criminals Yang Abu and Liu Jinyun, and recovered the stolen goods. Yesterday, they were brought to the county government for questioning and fully confessed. The victim was also summoned to identify them clearly on file. However, yesterday the county government questioned Yang Abu, who confessed that Wang Xiaodi, who lives in the city's east gate, was also an accomplice in the robbery. The bailiff then arrested Wang Xiaodi, who was brought to the county government for questioning today. According to Wang Xiaodi's confession, he did know Liu and others, but he did not know that they were thieves. The interrogator judged that Wang was suspicious and ordered him to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<p>Use of medicated wine for seedling planting: On the afternoon of the 7th, a pilgrim with a Zhejiang Jiaxing accent came to Maqi Temple in the city and claimed to be asking the temple monks to chant scriptures to pray for the ancestors. He carried food such as wine cakes and sesame cakes in his hands. When it was getting dark, the pilgrim planned to fill his stomach with sesame cakes and asked the incense burner to boil tea. He immediately took out a wine bottle and invited the Chen family's wife, who was nearly eighty years old and had been practicing in the temple for a long time, and the incense burner to drink with him. Unexpectedly, the wine was mixed with marijuana. After drinking it, they all became drowsy and lost all consciousness. When they woke up, they suddenly did not see the pilgrim. Upon checking, they found that Mrs. Chen's two gold ornaments and more than eighty yuan in cash had been lost. It was also a new type of seedling planting technique.</p>

<p>Higher Court plans to build a new prison: Lin, the president of the Higher Court, stated that the originally approved number of prisoners in the province was 13,000, but it has now increased to more than 20,000. The original number of the third sub-prison and detention center on Siqian Street of the Higher Court was 500, but there are now about 1,300 people detained, exceeding the approved number by more than half. Although the old arsenal at Shizikou outside Panmen has been rebuilt into a temporary shelter, it can only accommodate 300 more people, which still cannot be effectively疏通. Therefore, the site of the old silk weaving factory inside Panmen (the original site of the Gangyuan Bureau) has been surveyed and deemed suitable for the construction of a prison. Therefore, a draft plan has been drawn up and sent to the provincial government today (the 8th) to be submitted for discussion at the 292nd meeting of the provincial government tomorrow in order to facilitate疏通 and benefit prison administration.</p>
<p>Judgment in the murder and dismemberment case: Jia Zhengyi, the owner of the Jia Hengxing hardware store in Yangyu Lane, suffered from mental illness last year and killed his younger brother Jia Songshan with a hammer.

<p>Reasons for the delay in the construction of long-distance telephones: In addition to the urban area and Loutang, where companies have successively laid long-distance telephones, the construction bureau has drafted a plan to set up six lines: Ji'an, Waihuang, Jiaxu, Jiaji, Xucao, and Chengguang. It will allocate special construction donations to pay for the expenses, together with the budget, and submit them to the county government for transfer to the construction bureau for approval. Later, the Construction Bureau instructed that the construction cost was too high and should be reduced. The bureau director should remake the budget according to the previous format and separately allocate the items. As for the use of special donations, a special case should be submitted for approval. Before the bureau's order to handle the matter is received and the source of funds is approved, no preparations should be made rashly. Therefore, this project still needs to be postponed.</p>

Now that Magistrate Li has taken over the affairs, he has received instructions from the Department of Civil Affairs that the case is to be handled by the judiciary. The Provincial Police Team has departed for Nantong to maintain order. On the evening of the 6th, Jiang Yizun and the other two individuals were escorted to the county government.

At the beginning of last month, the families of the victims came to Zhenjiang to collect the compensation. However, the responsible party, Yu Shicheng, repeatedly delayed the process. Yesterday, the families of the victims, due to the busy farming season, gathered at Yu's residence to demand payment. Yu, seeing the tense situation and unable to make excuses, raised the cash and led the families to the Chamber of Commerce for distribution. This time, the compensation was based on the certificates issued last year, stating that each household would receive 168 yuan, 2 jiao, and 4 fen, which had been reported to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction for record-keeping. Unexpectedly, Yu suddenly denied the previous agreement and shortchanged each household by 21 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8 fen, totaling 1,800 yuan for 85 households. The families of the victims protested in vain and originally planned to go to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction to petition, but due to the busy farming season, they had to return home to cultivate the land and had no choice but to accept the injustice. It is reported that the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, and the County Party Headquarters believed that the case had already been decided, how could Yu be allowed to overturn it on his own, and have strictly ordered Yu to make up the full amount.</p>

<p>Preparatory Committee Convenes Commemorative Meeting</p>
<p>To Be Held at 9:00 AM at the Penglai Theater</p>
<p>All Sectors of Industry, Commerce, and Education Will Not Take a Holiday</p>
<p>On May 7th of the Republic of China year four, the Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of the domestic warlord Yuan Shikai's attempt to establish an empire and the tense international situation due to the European war, coerced the puppet government in Beijing with the Twenty-One Demands, a secret treaty aimed at destroying China. They forced the government to recognize the Demands within forty-eight hours. At the time, Yuan hoped to seek assistance from Japan and signed the recognition on May 9th. This unprecedented humiliation has not yet been avenged. Today (the 9th) marks the fifteenth anniversary of the May Ninth National Humiliation of the Twenty-One Demands. The Preparatory Committee of the May Revolution Commemoration Day for all sectors of the city has specifically decided to convene a commemorative meeting for all sectors at the Penglai Theater at 9:00 AM. All agencies, organizations, and party branches at all levels must send four representatives to participate. The Municipal Executive Committee also issued a declaration to the public and comrades (the original text is very long and omitted). The central government stipulates that the "May Ninth" holiday will not be observed according to the holiday regulations for revolutionary commemorative days.

<p>To Stop Yan from Intercepting Taxes in Jin</p>
<p>The Silver and Money Exchange Association telegraphed the Banking Association of this city, stating that there were rumors of customs revenue being intercepted. Concerned about the credit of domestic debt, a joint meeting was convened yesterday, resolving to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to express their opinions and to send a telegram to the Banking Association of Pingjin to make representations to the authorities nearby. The original texts of the two telegrams are recorded below: (1) Telegram to the Ministry of Finance: To the esteemed Administrative Yuan, Ministry of Finance of the Nanjing National Government: It has come to our attention that recent Chinese and Western newspapers have reported that customs revenue in Tianjin has been intercepted. Although there are declarations that 5% of the old tax will be set aside to protect foreign debt credit, the customs system is thus being undermined. Once a bad precedent is set, it will follow the same path as the salt tax in the past. Foreigners will be wary of this, and restrictions and precautions will be unavoidable. This will greatly hinder the future of customs autonomy and the abolition of unequal treaties. This is a cause for concern from a diplomatic perspective. Since the founding of the Republic, the domestic debt market has been greatly opened, scattered among the people, amounting to hundreds of millions. The reason why this credit could be gained and this achievement could be made is that the fund is independent and has been outside of factional politics for many years. If this system is now undermined, nominally intercepting customs revenue, it is actually shaking the foundation and the credit of public bonds will plummet. This relates to the livelihoods of individuals on a small scale and the destruction of the social economy on a large scale. There will be no recovery, and the entire country will suffer. This is a cause for concern from the perspective of the people's economy. Our country's production is lagging behind, and the poverty of the people and the danger of the nation have reached their extremes. Military and political affairs aside, if we want to revitalize the country in the future, we must seek construction. If we want to plan construction, we must rely on domestic debt. If we now shake the foundation of domestic debt, which has a proven track record, for no reason, then the people, learning from the past examples of the first-year public bond and the ninety-six public bond, will not consider any domestic debt, and all efforts will be abandoned. Considering the painstaking efforts of various leaders and giants to save the times, they should not be willing to do this. This is a cause for concern from the perspective of national finance. All of these points are based on facts and are universally understood. They are not alarmist words. We hope that you will listen to our words and change your course. Our association manages the financial hub, and it is our duty not to remain silent. We earnestly hope that you will consider this and work together to remedy the situation, thereby maintaining the nation's vitality and stabilizing people's hearts. We would be endlessly grateful. Signed, Shanghai Banking Association and Money Exchange Association. (2) Telegram to the Banking Associations of Pingjin: To the esteemed Banking Associations of Beiping and Tianjin: The following is a telegram sent to the Ministry of Finance: (See above). We respectfully request that your association make earnest representations to the authorities nearby. The situation is urgent, and we hope that you will proceed in unison and provide instructions at any time. Signed, Shanghai Banking Association and Money Exchange Association.</p>
<p>The Fund Custody Committee telegraphed the Jianghai Customs Second Five Tax National Treasury Bond Fund Custody Committee, stating that there were rumors of customs revenue in Tianjin being intercepted. The committee held a meeting the other day and resolved to telegraph the Ministry of Finance and send a telegram to the Banking Associations of Pingjin to express their opinions. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance of the National Government: Reports state that the Tianjin Customs revenue, except for the 5% used to offset foreign debt, has been entirely retained by Tianjin. This revenue is designated to be used to guarantee the various domestic debt funds in the custody of our association, with the right of preferential allocation. The amount of these bonds is enormous and widely circulated. Bondholders are not only prevalent throughout the country but also include enthusiastic investors among overseas Chinese and foreign merchants. Therefore, the stability of the fund has a significant relationship with the national economy and international reputation. Since our association has taken custody, we have been diligent and conscientious, earnestly hoping that the entire country, regardless of regional boundaries, will work together to maintain the fund, protect the rights of creditors, and demonstrate national credibility. If the bad precedent of interception is set, it will inevitably cause panic in the national economy. How can the government gain the trust of China and abroad in the future? Furthermore, the fact that domestic debt funds cannot receive the same treatment and security as foreign debt is particularly painful for the Chinese people. Our association's duty is to not remain silent. We earnestly request that you provide strong support to maintain stability and alleviate people's concerns. We are filled with anticipation."</p>
<p>The Commercial Consolidation Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the General Chambers of Commerce of Beiping and Tianjin to request a stop to the interception of customs revenue in Tianjin. (1) Telegram to the Ministry of Finance: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance of Nanjing: There are rumors of the Tianjin Customs revenue being intercepted. The merchants were shocked to hear this. It should be noted that customs revenue is designated as a guarantee for domestic and foreign debt funds, and a committee has been established to independently manage it. If this interception becomes a reality, then the financial and social economy will be destroyed, and the credit of foreign debt will be shaken. From a diplomatic perspective, it will give international powers a pretext, affecting the future of customs autonomy and the abolition of treaties. The magnitude of the impact is unbearable. We specifically request that you quickly take measures to maintain the situation so that the interception does not become a reality, people's hearts can be stabilized, and the country's future can be relied upon. Urgent telegram, respectfully requesting your consideration." (2) Telegram to the General Chambers of Commerce of Beiping and Tianjin: "To the esteemed General Chambers of Commerce of Beiping and Tianjin: There are reports of the Tianjin Customs revenue being intercepted, which is deeply shocking. It should be noted that customs revenue is related to domestic and foreign debt funds. If a problem occurs, international credibility will be lost, and the domestic social economy will be harmed. Moreover, in the future, if the government issues foreign debt bonds, the people will take this as a warning and regard them with fear. Its impact on future construction will be profound and significant. We respectfully request that you make earnest representations to prevent interception. We are filled with anticipation. Urgent telegram, awaiting your reply. Signed, Geng Yin, Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants Association Consolidation Committee."</p>

<p>Telegraphs for Shigemitsu to Return Home</p>
<p>To Consult on Future Negotiation Steps</p>
<p>His Actions Will Be Decided Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Japanese government, now that the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has been officially signed and announced, specifically telegraphed yesterday for Acting Minister Shigemitsu Aoi to return to Tokyo for consultations on future negotiation steps. After receiving the telegram, Shigemitsu hoped that the Japanese government would send someone to Shanghai to negotiate, as his official duties here are busy. His actions will be decided today or tomorrow. If Shigemitsu decides to return home, then the departure date will be in the middle of this month. As for the rumors that Shigemitsu will be promoted to the official Minister to China, it is said by Japanese sources that this is an overreaction. Shigemitsu returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning at 7:00 AM.</p>

<p>Chinese Silk Merchants Suffer Another Blow</p>
<p>The Da Wanbao reported that Indian import and export merchants in this city received a telegram yesterday (the 7th) from the Sino-Japanese Silk Merchants Association in Mumbai, stating that the political situation in India is serious, business in Mumbai is completely stalled, and it is feared that the situation will not improve in a short time. They requested that all export firms in that port suspend shipments of all silk goods from May 22nd to August 1st. After receiving the telegram, the Indian merchants convened an emergency meeting of export merchants in the afternoon to discuss the matter. After discussion, it was agreed that although the losses would be great, there was no other option but to comply with the suspension of shipments. According to statistics from the Indian Chamber of Commerce in this city, the value of silk shipped to India each month since January of this year has exceeded one million taels. If this suspension of shipments continues for a long time, the Chinese silk industry will suffer another major blow.</p>

<p>Eight Centers Initially... Remaining Centers Being Sought</p>
<p>To Be Opened on the 11th of This Month</p>
<p>The situation of the low-priced rice program being organized in this city was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the locations have been slightly changed. The original plan was to establish ten centers in the urban area, but the locations of the following eight centers have now been determined: the first center is at the Chao-Hui Association Hall on the Bund in Maojia Lane; the second center is at the Pudong Public Association in Xuejia浜; the third center is at the Caojiadu Security Corps; the fourth center is at the Lujiabang Soup Kitchen; the fifth center is at the Taiping Temple on Lan Road in Yangshupu; the sixth center is at the Yuezhou Road Intersection Roundabout Temple; the seventh center is at the Haichang Public Association on Haichang Road in Zhabei; and the eighth center is at the Yu Family Temple in Laobaidu, Pudong. There are still two locations to be determined, as suitable locations are still being sought. All of the above eight centers are scheduled to open on May 11th. The Social Affairs Bureau has sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Bureau, requesting them to send police to provide security. The Social Affairs Bureau also convened a meeting with various municipal committees regarding low-priced rice in the rural areas, with the goal of starting with a survey of poor households. Once the survey is completed, the program will be launched. The bureau also hopes to establish all low-priced rice centers in the rural areas by May 20th.</p>

<p>The draft Sino-French Vietnamese trade agreement was completed last autumn, but the formal signing has been delayed due to procrastination on the French side.

<h3 id="e118">Sino-French-Vietnamese Agreement <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Delay in Signing Issue</p>
<p>Chinese Commissioner Chu Minyi Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Request Accepted</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency Singapore Correspondence: Since the Sino-Vietnamese old agreement was announced to be abolished and the new agreement has been delayed in signing, the Vietnamese French government has treated overseas Chinese as people from non-treaty countries, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, doing everything possible to suppress them. The arbitrary increase in tariffs has caused the overseas Chinese business situation to decline, and domestically produced goods cannot be imported and sold due to the increased tax rate and excessive burden. Overseas Chinese merchants have suffered greatly. Recently, the French government issued regulations restricting overseas Chinese merchants. From May 1st of this year, all stores in Vietnam with an annual license tax of more than 500 yuan (in addition to the regular tax, there will be an additional tax of more than 40%) must use French bookkeeping. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina has repeatedly requested that this be changed, but the French Resident Superior in Vietnam, citing that the Sino-Vietnamese new agreement has not yet been concluded, will implement this forcibly. Overseas Chinese are experiencing great pain in politics and commerce due to the inequality of their international status and the absence of a Chinese consulate in Vietnam. There is no way to appeal. This time, when Chinese Commissioner Dr. Chu Minyi visited Vietnam, the overseas Chinese earnestly requested his intervention on this important issue and asked him to convey their request to Gao Lu, the Chinese Minister to France, for direct negotiations with the French government to fight for their rights based on reason. At the same time, they hoped that the Sino-Vietnamese new agreement would be signed as soon as possible to alleviate the suffering of the overseas Chinese. The doctor has agreed to their request and, in addition to formally presenting the document to Minister Gao, has also instructed Tang, the Chinese Consul General in Singapore, to send a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate and handle the matter. Dr. Chu's views on the Sino-Vietnamese new agreement are briefly described below: Overseas Chinese engage in business overseas, living frugally and enduring hardship. They are repeatedly humiliated by the authorities in their countries of residence due to the inequality of their international status. Their pain is almost indescribable. The enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for loving their country and donating funds is evident in their past achievements and is clear for all to see. The Sino-Vietnamese old agreement has already been abolished, but the new agreement has not yet been signed. During this transitional period, the losses have been significant, and the diplomatic authorities are difficult to excuse. The abolition of unequal treaties has instead lost its protection. I (the doctor referring to himself), as a consultant to the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, should bear the responsibility. The other day, I met Pasgier, the Governor of Cochinchina, Knautheimer, the Governor of Cochinchina, and Chatodemis, and expressed my views on this important issue. I still hope that you will show temporary tolerance. The Chinese and French authorities will definitely have a solution in the near future. The presentation of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina is recorded below: The presentation is for a request. It should be noted that the use of Western commercial bookkeeping is stipulated in the Sino-Vietnamese old treaty, and overseas Chinese in Vietnam are never required to implement it. Now, the Vietnamese French government has issued an order to implement Western commercial bookkeeping in stores owned by Chinese merchants in Vietnam with a regular tax of more than 500 yuan from May 1st of this year. The overseas Chinese in Vietnam are terrified. They are currently trying to request that the case be canceled, but it is not known whether they will be able to achieve this goal. Back in 1925, the Vietnamese French government proposed that Chinese businesses use Western bookkeeping. At the time, Mr. Ye Boxing, the former chairman of the association, was in office. For this matter, Mr. Ye convened several meetings of Chinese business directors at the association. Everyone believed that the matter was difficult to implement, and Mr. Ye was publicly elected to present a request to the Governor of Cochinchina to form a committee to review the matter. The committee consisted of the chairman of the Western Chamber of Commerce, a first-class advisor appointed by the Vietnamese French government, the secretary of the Mayor of Dike, and the former manager of the Saigon Asia Foreign Company. The committee held two meetings on October 30th and November 6th, 1925. Mr. Ye reported to the committee the situation that Chinese people had difficulty implementing Western bookkeeping. The committee acknowledged that the report was true. The Vietnamese French government was concerned that there might be errors or unclear points in the Chinese commercial accounts. Mr. Ye proposed that the association hire two auditors, and the government could entrust the association to review the Chinese accounts if they found them unclear. Chinese people would not have to use Western bookkeeping. Thus, the case of Chinese people using Western bookkeeping was presented by the committee to the Vietnamese French government for temporary suspension of implementation. In 1928, the association hired two auditors and reported their names to the Saigon Commercial Court for record. They subsequently received a reply approving this. The president of the court also summoned five accounting officials in Saigon to inquire whether any malpractices had been found in the Chinese commercial accounts they had handled. They replied that no fraudulent activities had ever been found in the accounts of large Chinese businesses with license taxes. As for the occasional messy accounts, they belonged to stores with license taxes of 7th or 8th class or lower, due to the merchants' lack of knowledge. It can be seen that the malpractice does not arise from the use of Chinese writing. The court president also believed this to be the real situation. Now, the Vietnamese French government has suddenly overturned the previous case. Cai Bojiu negotiated with the Governor of Cochinchina on the 2nd of this month, requesting that the case of Chinese people implementing Western commercial bookkeeping be canceled. However, the Governor cited that our government has repeatedly delayed signing the Sino-Vietnamese new agreement, causing Chinese people residing here to be treated as people from non-treaty countries. He also said that Western commercial bookkeeping is not only required for foreigners. In this way, the Vietnamese government is determined to implement the case of Western commercial bookkeeping, which greatly hinders the commerce of our overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in Vietnam are very opposed to this. Please negotiate with the French government nearby to quickly cancel the case of Chinese people implementing Western commercial bookkeeping in Vietnam, so as to alleviate the difficulties of the overseas Chinese. All overseas Chinese will be very grateful for this great virtue. Respectfully presented to Gao, the Minister of the Republic of China in France. Cai Bojiu, Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina.</p>

<p>Since China and Siam have not yet signed a treaty of commerce, Chinese citizens traveling to Siam are naturally governed by the laws of the place where they reside. However, the Siamese government has long prohibited private groups and charitable organizations from various countries from sending personnel to Siam to solicit donations from overseas Chinese. The government has also repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with important figures from various countries coming to Siam to promote their countries' politics. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from the local General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that in the future, if any personnel are sent to Siam to solicit donations or engage in propaganda, they should first submit a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification of international procedures and inform the Siamese government. They should also obtain a valid passport to enter Siam to avoid being detained and to ensure safe travel.</p>

<p>Procedures Completed... Funding Not Secured</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the S.S. Xin Kang of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company being sunk by the Japanese ship Tatsuno Maru, it will soon be a year, and there is still no concrete solution. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in accordance with the Ministry's order, has filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court. The families' association of the victims had also hired Dr. Sheng Zhenwei as a legal advisor, and the association had submitted various forms and reports to Lawyer Sheng to prepare the lawsuit and submit it to the court, demanding that the Japanese side compensate for all losses. The procedural aspects have been completed, but the necessary funding for the lawsuit is still not secured, so it is still delayed. The standing committee members of the association, Mr. Zhu, Mr. Zhu, and Mr. Zhou, have been running around for days to raise funds and file the lawsuit, so as not to fall short of success. The families of the victims inquire at the association every day.</p>

<p>Setting Ten Thousand Yuan as the Minimum Standard</p>
<p>Denying the Social Bureau's Overstepping of Authority</p>
<p>The S.S. Xin Da Ming of the former Datong Xieji Steamship Company was unjustifiably sunk by the Japanese merchant Sato Shokai's Atsuta No. 2 Maru in February of the 17th year of the Republic of China in the Dongxingang area of Waisha, Chongming, causing 365 passenger and crew members to perish (evidence has been verified). The loss of cargo was estimated at several hundred thousand. The Chinese and Japanese sides had long invited impartial individuals to form an arbitration committee, which determined that the Japanese side should be liable for 265,000 in compensation for the loss of cargo. Later, because the Japanese side delayed payment, after repeated negotiations, Datong Company suddenly agreed to reduce the compensation to 180,000 in cash to resolve the matter. However, the diplomatic authorities considered the compensation for loss of life to be important, concerning national rights and the lives of the people, and could not be arbitrated, so it was necessary to make formal representations to the Japanese side. However, since handling the negotiations, the Japanese side has only acknowledged 25,000 Japanese yen. All the families believe that 25,000 Japanese yen, calculated at the current market rate, is equivalent to 40,000 national currency, with each family receiving only about 100 yuan. If this is acknowledged, the lives of Chinese people will have a fixed price. Future diplomacy will use this as an example, and our country's ships can be arbitrarily sunk to destroy our shipping rights. Therefore, everyone denies this and demands that the minimum amount be 1,000 yuan per person. However, for the sake of forbearance, if the Japanese side is sincere in resolving the matter, it will be reduced to a standard of 100,000 yuan. The Japanese side has been ignoring this ever since Lawyer Wu Kaisheng represented the families last year, and more than half a year has passed. The Japanese side is still deliberately delaying, hoping to end the matter without resolution. Since Lawyer Wu went abroad, the case has been handled by Lawyers Wu Chengzi, Chen Zemin, and Gao Shuo. However, there is still no increased hope. Unexpectedly, the Social Bureau recently approved the Haiyuan Gonghui's (Seamen's Union's) request to negotiate labor-capital issues with Yang Zaitian of Datong Company. Yang Zaitian specially appointed Ma Xishen and Gao Shuo as representatives to resolve the labor-capital dispute. It was unexpectedly resolved with the Japanese side agreeing to 25,000 Japanese yen as the standard for resolving the case, and there was a distinction between crew members and passengers, with the compensation being divided into a 40-60 split. All the families were greatly shocked upon hearing the news. They went to Lawyer Wu's office for several days, requesting to declare to the Social Bureau that they did not recognize the resolution of the case. Lawyer Wu considered the case to be important and discussed it with Lawyers Chen and Gao. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a representative meeting was convened for all the families at Lawyer Wu's office on Nanjing Road. More than 50 people attended, and the general representative, Pei Jiesan, was elected as the chairman to report on the progress of the situation (see previous summary). Next, each family expressed their opinions, and the resolutions were as follows: (1) This case concerns diplomacy and law, not a labor-capital dispute. The handling and resolution by the Social Bureau is considered inappropriate, and all the families unanimously deny it and request the representative lawyers in this case to protest. (2) Lawyer Gao Shuo, who represented the case, should be asked to state his position on signing the case. (3) The Japanese side's compensation of 25,000 Japanese yen is denied, and based on the previous agreement, the minimum amount is 100,000 yuan. In the future, the money received should be distributed equally between passengers and crew members. The special treatment of crew members should be the responsibility of the shipowner and should not be a condition for life compensation. (4) Send a letter to Yang Zaitian, declaring that the minimum amount of compensation for the families is 100,000 yuan. If a private settlement is made and 40,000 yuan is received from the Japanese side, Mr. Yang should be responsible for 100,000 yuan. (5) The recent handling of the situation and the Social Bureau's handling of labor-capital issues that encroached on the scope of diplomatic law should be reported to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that serious representations be made to the Japanese side to prevent other agencies from overstepping their authority, so as to emphasize national rights and the lives of the people. The above resolutions were unanimously approved and passed. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e128">British and Japanese Merchants Compete for Northern Shipping Rights <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Rushing to Build Ships to Prepare for Expansion</p>
<p>After our country's claim to recover shipping rights, Japanese shipping companies immediately began to add ships and increase the frequency of services on various routes along the coast of our country. British shipping companies are not willing to be outdone and are doing their best to compete for shipping rights along the coast of China. The competition is currently intensifying in the northern route. What has been learned recently is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Increase Freight Rates to Tianjin Direct ships from Japan to Tianjin, operated by Osaka and Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK), each operate four ships. In addition, NYK also operates four ships to Yingkou and Andong, in order to facilitate the direct transportation of Japanese goods to northern China. Recently, citing the low silver price and increased ship operating expenses, NYK has decided to implement a price increase for freight rates on the Tianjin route, and it is said that it has been agreed to increase the original rate by 30%. At the same time, it is also planned to increase the freight rates for goods shipped from Japan to Qingdao by 30%. It is said that this new freight rate is being drafted.</p>
<p>British Merchants Add New Ships to Northern Routes The British merchant company Butterfield &amp; Swire has the most ships in this city and is also the most aggressive in its business operations. On the northern route, the company has regular ships, such as the Tongzhou, Shuntian, and Fengtian, which depart every three days. Since the Dalian Company added Shanghai-Tianjin liner services last winter, Butterfield &amp; Swire has planned to build two fast ships with strong speed to compete with Japanese merchants in North China shipping. The two ships are being built at the company's own shipyard in Hong Kong, and their speed and cargo capacity are larger than those of the Tongzhou and others. It is said that one ship will be completed this year. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is also adding a new ship to the northern route, using an oil engine and paying great attention to passenger capacity. It can also be completed this year.</p>
<p>Dalian's New Ship to be Completed Soon The Dalian Steamship Company's third new ship, the Changchun Maru, is being built by the Mitsubishi Shipyard in Kobe, and is specially designed to develop cargo and passenger connections between southern Manchuria and Shanghai. The cost is 2 million Japanese yen, the net tonnage is 3,950 tons, and there are 50 first-class cabins, 27 second-class cabins, and 50 third-class cabins. The fourth-class can carry more than 300 people. The hull of the ship has already been built. The company received a telegram from the head office stating that the new ship Changchun Maru is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai for operation at the end of August. At the same time, a new route will be opened between Guangzhou and Tianjin.</p>
<p>New Yizhou Opens a Shipping Port The China-Korea liner of the Joseon Steamship Company operates between Shanghai, Busan, Incheon, and Zhenmupu. Now, due to goods being loaded from New Yizhou to Shanghai, the company has agreed to open a shipping port in New Yizhou from the export ship of May 13th at the request of the local merchants. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to Shanghai, ordering the Shanghai office to collect export goods to New Yizhou from today.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Xin Feng Damaged in Collision and Comes to Shanghai for Repairs <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Fault Lies Entirely with the Lighter</p>
<p>Tai Shun Temporarily Takes Over Tianjin Route</p>
<p>The S.S. Xin Feng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was damaged in the bow by an iron lighter inside the Dagukou during its voyage from Tianjin to Shanghai. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai from northern China. Because the hull was damaged, it must be taken out of service for repairs. The details of the collision are recorded below:</p>
<p>Bow Damaged The S.S. Xin Feng departed from Zizhu Lin last Friday. While traveling near the Caijia Gang River surface of Dagukou, two iron lighters of the Dagukou Lighter Company, fully loaded with gasoline, passed by, towed by a small tugboat into the Baihe River. The S.S. Xin Feng was traveling according to the navigation channel, and the two iron lighters coming head-on, the last one with the tow cable broken, the hull became horizontal, temporarily unable to stop and crashed into the bow of the S.S. Xin Feng. The S.S. Xin Feng tried to avoid, but it was too late, causing a large hole to be struck in the left bow compartment. Seawater immediately entered the ship. Fortunately, it was a water compartment, so the goods were not damaged. But the ship could no longer go to sea, and immediately returned to Tanggu for repairs.</p>
<p>Lighter Damaged The offending iron lighter was huge, with a capacity of 500 tons, and heavily loaded, so the impact force was great. The head of the lighter was also destroyed on the spot. The lighter immediately sank horizontally in the river, blocking the channel. Both inbound and outbound ships were unable to pass. Later, after being towed by a tugboat, the S.S. Xin Feng was requested to push the sunken iron lighter from behind to the beach to run aground. The boatmen in the lighter all escaped to the tugboat, and most of the gasoline it was carrying was lost. Tai Shun Takes Over The hole in the Xin Feng caused by the collision is about three feet. After the ship arrived at the Tanggu Wharf and docked for two days, wooden boards were temporarily used to cover the hole. An on-site investigation was conducted with the Dagukou Lighter Company to determine the truth of the accident. As a result, the lighter side admitted its mistake, and the Xin Feng's damage and losses must be borne by the lighter company. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai with passengers and cargo safe. Because the damage needs major repairs urgently, the bureau decided to dispatch the Tai Shun to temporarily take over the route. The Xin Feng can enter the dock today.</p>

<p>Telegrams Zhejiang Province to Protect Cocoon Merchants</p>
<p>Huang Jinschen, Chairman of the Jiang-Zhe-Wan Silk Cocoon General Association, sent a telegram to Zhang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, yesterday, stating: "Respectfully to Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Junjian. Recently, 34 silk cocoon merchants, including Cai Qingrun of Shuanglin Town, Wuxing County, sent a winter telegram stating that silk cocoon companies are springing up in Shuanglin Town, and the cocoon market is approaching, but bandits are rampant, and robberies are not uncommon during the day. If sufficient protection is not provided by more stationed troops, farmers and merchants will be disheartened. The merchants have repeatedly telegraphed to the provincial government, requesting the dispatch of troops to suppress the bandits, but no instructions have been received yet. Please quickly forward this to the provincial government and send a regiment of troops to reassure farmers and merchants. It is most urgent to await orders, etc." It has been found that the counties in the Lake District have been quite unstable recently. At this time, the cocoon market should be carefully guarded. Shuanglin Town is a prosperous area for silk cocoons in Wuxing. According to the merchants' winter telegram, people are panicked and cannot sleep peacefully. When new cocoons are on the market, more capable troops should be dispatched to station in Shuanglin Town and the main silk cocoon areas of the Lake District to suppress the bandits and stabilize the cocoon market. In addition to submitting a separate document on the protection of the cocoon market, this telegram is sent again. Please examine and order the swift implementation of the above. It is most convenient to the public."</p>

<p>Preparing to Commemorate Lin Zexu</p>
<p>June 3rd is the 91st anniversary of the burning of British merchants' opium by Lin Wenzhong Gong, the pioneer of anti-drug efforts in our country. Last year, on the 90th anniversary, the National Government ordered all provinces, cities, and counties to hold commemorations on this day to show commendation. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association believes that the commemoration of the public should be expanded this year, so the association has prepared a general outline of commemoration methods and notified anti-drug organizations in various places to jointly prepare and hold the commemoration on time with local sympathetic organizations and party and government agencies. The notification methods are excerpted as follows: (1) Notification, respectfully opening, tracing back to the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, foreign opium was sold well in our country, and the whole country was in a state of darkness. The good bodies of the people were completely destroyed, and the society and the country suffered great losses. The opium-producing countries of the great powers did their best to poison China in order to achieve their aggressive ambitions. Fortunately, Lin Gong Zexu witnessed the great difficulties and deeply knew that opium was enough to destroy the country and destroy the body. He took decisive measures to burn British merchants' opium to show his determination to ban it. Unfortunately, due to the lack of organization in the Qing government and the abandonment of military preparations, it was unable to fight. In addition, the officials in the court and the public were deeply poisoned, thinking that Lin Gong's actions were illegal and instead paid compensation to Britain and begged for peace, creating the beginning of unequal treaties and plunging our country into a state of no return. Now, it has been 91 years since Lin Gong burned opium. Last year, the National Government ordered commendation and held commemorations throughout the country to commemorate the past sages and encourage the future struggle. June 3rd of this year is the day of commemoration. All our anti-drug organizations should hold commemorations on this day to show respect and encourage them. The corresponding letter, please unite with local party and government agencies and Qing organizations to prepare properly in advance and hold it on time. The future of anti-drug efforts is deeply reliant on it. (2) Methods: (1) Hold a memorial meeting, (2) Publish a commemorative special issue, (3) Hold a public lecture, (4) Hold a parade and propaganda, (5) Art propaganda, (6) Burn drugs, (7) Hold an anti-drug oath, (8) Post slogans widely, (9) Sell anti-drug monthly magazines.</p>

<p>Both Labor and Capital Sides Send Representatives to the Capital</p>
<p>Following the labor dispute in the pharmaceutical industry arising from the issue of accommodating unemployed workers, the central government dispatched Shi Weihuan, Secretary of the Training Department, to Shanghai to investigate. Subsequently, a regular meeting decided on six measures to resolve the case and revised the third article, handing them over to the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government for handling. After receiving the second order from the central government, the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government consulted and resolved five measures, instructing the labor side to resume work on April 24th and limiting the capital side to employing 70 unemployed workers within three days. The various situations have been repeatedly reported in the previous newspaper, but the capital side has delayed fulfilling its obligations and has sent a large number of representatives to petition the central government. Upon hearing this, the labor side also sent representatives to the capital to state everything and accuse the capital side of disobeying the central government's orders, requesting that an order be issued for their arrest. The central government then ordered the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government to strictly enforce the orders. Yesterday afternoon, the representatives of the capital side returned to Shanghai from the capital. The labor side specially waited at the North Railway Station, requesting the Public Security Bureau to detain one of the representatives, Feng Jinpu. The other two escaped upon hearing the news. It is said that Feng will be transferred to the Municipal Government today.</p>

<h3 id="e136">The Case of Burying One's Only Son Alive <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Inside Story Revealed</p>
<p>Genbao Has Already Fled</p>
<p>Caidi Has Also Gone Missing</p>
<p>Adultery Reveals Springtime</p>
<p>Murder for Property</p>
<p>Mao Da, the 13-year-old only son of Guan Liukun, a villager at No. 45 Yangjiajing Guannong, Tanzikou, Zhabei, was suddenly buried alive and killed the other day. This was discovered by Guan's sister, Hou Guan, while she was cutting grass in the field. At the same time, all three sons of Hou Guan have disappeared, giving rise to great suspicion. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, no one knew exactly why Guan's three sons committed such a heinous act. Some said that Guan Liukun had reprimanded his nephew severely, causing him to harbor resentment, plot murder, and vent his anger. But it is unlikely that a person would be put to death for such a trivial matter. After a day of investigation by the reporter, the truth has come out. There is a secret affair involved, which is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Love for Sons, Not Daughters Guan Liukun's first wife died of illness many years ago. She gave birth to a daughter named Caidi, who is now 19 years old and has a good appearance. She has been helping her father farm at home. Later, Guan remarried Chen, who gave birth to a son, Mao Da, who was buried alive. He is 13 years old this year. After Guan had a son, he was overjoyed that the family line could be continued. He raised him carefully and cultivated him with enthusiasm. He originally planned to recruit a son-in-law, but now he sent his daughter to work in a yarn factory and chose another name for her. Caidi was out of favor, filled with resentment, and had no opportunity to vent it.</p>
<p>Genbao Gambles Hou Guan, who lives in the Hou family's house, is Guan's second sister and has been a widow for many years. She has three sons: Ai Bi, A Er, and the youngest Genbao. Ai Bi and A Er help their mother with farm work and are considered stable, but Genbao is lazy and likes to gamble. Because he lives not far from Guannong, he often goes to his uncle's house to chat. Guan treats him very well, but he always scolds him for irregular behavior.</p>
<p>Springtime Revealed When Caidi had not yet entered the factory to work, she and Genbao would play with each other whenever Genbao came home. Their intimacy was beyond the ordinary. At first, they were just childhood sweethearts, but as they grew older, their feelings were awakened. Over time, they had an affair. Guan Liukun left early and returned late, very busy, and Guan's wife suffered from madness and sat in the bedroom all day, unaware of their obscene behavior. Unexpectedly, good things are often frustrated. Last month, when Genbao and Caidi were having a secret meeting, Mao Da happened to return home from school and accidentally saw them, revealing the hidden affair. Genbao was afraid of being exposed, so he threatened Mao Da and told him to keep it a secret, or he would take his life. Mao Da was very afraid and did not announce it.</p>
<p>Strike First Since Genbao had an affair with Caidi, he wanted to silence Mao Da and treat him kindly. But lately, Genbao had been doing this for a long time and treated it as nothing. Sometimes he even scolded or beat him. Mao Da was extremely angry and said, "I will tell your affairs to my father!" Genbao was very frightened when he heard this and discussed it with his two brothers. They all said that it was better to strike first, and they thought that after killing Mao Da, they could seize his property. So a tragedy was created.</p>
<p>Tragedy of Burial Alive At about 5:00 PM on the 6th, Genbao and his two brothers went to a field next to the Yangjiajing tomb and dug a hole about five feet deep and three feet wide. Genbao lured Mao Da out to play and passed by the pre-dug hole, turned him upside down and inserted him into it, and covered him with mud. He died in an instant.</p>
<p>Daughter Also Missing The other day, Hou Guan went to the field to cut grass and saw a piece of land that had been dug by someone. She took a shovel and dug it up, revealing the body and reporting it to Guan. At first, she did not know who the murderer was, but when Genbao and others fled, she suspected them. Unexpectedly, Caidi also suddenly disappeared yesterday, so the case became clear. The Fourth District Office is now ordering the police to strictly apprehend them and bring them to justice. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor appointed by the Special District District Court came to examine the body and ordered the family to take it away for burial after verifying that it was buried alive before death.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Champagne Ticket Winner <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Jockey Harry Lewis Suspended</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reports: This year's Shanghai horse racing's Champagne Sweepstakes will be an event that Shanghai residents will likely remember for a long time. At the very least, thirty-five detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Police will have a permanent memento, as they won the second prize of 64,000 yuan in the A-category Champagne Sweepstakes. This amounts to approximately 1,900 yuan per person. They pooled their money to buy the ticket on April 1st, which Westerners call April Fool's Day. Unexpectedly, it turned into a lucky day. Therefore, these detectives will hold a celebration banquet tomorrow (the 9th). One of them, Western Detective Quail, has double the joy, as he not only owns shares in the second prize but also won the third prize of 32,000 yuan solely. As for the first prize, half of it was won by a Japanese merchant from a small shop on Rue du Consulat, totaling over 120,000 yuan. In addition, two Westerners from the J. L. Morrison &amp; Co. are also winners of this prize. The person who purchased the ticket on their behalf was veterinarian Edward Hagger. The first prize for the B-category Champagne Sweepstakes was won by a Western merchant from Kobe, a lucky individual who has frequently won the Shanghai horse racing Champagne Sweepstakes. The jockey who suffered the greatest loss in this race was Harry Lewis. He is one of the best jockeys in China and was originally scheduled to ride the most promising horse, "Breezy Pea." However, before the final race, he asked Edward Hagger to purchase a one-tenth share of the horse's Champagne ticket. Hagger reported this to the Western stewards of the Shanghai Race Club, who immediately suspended Lewis indefinitely. Another jockey was assigned to replace him. Subsequently, the horse won first place. However, the jockey stated that the entire matter was a misunderstanding and that sharing Champagne ticket winnings is a common practice in the horse racing circle. He added that he was not at all concerned about not being able to purchase a share of the Champagne ticket, but was deeply saddened by not being able to show his skills and win the race. Last night, there were rumors that the jockey intended to file a lawsuit, but this morning (the 8th), it was claimed that this story was fabricated. He is currently seeking reinstatement. It is said that he has been a jockey for ten years and has a spotless record.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Public Concession <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw Licenses Difficult to Add</p>
<p>Municipal Council Has Given Formal Reply</p>
<p>Chen Shiguang, Director of the Diplomatic Affairs Office in Shanghai, previously received instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urgently negotiate with the British Municipal Council regarding the petition from rickshaw merchant Zheng Limin to add 5,161 rickshaw licenses to help the 100,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai. Director Chen exchanged views informally with Edwardes, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, who verbally indicated that a written reply would be given only after a thorough discussion by a special committee. Director Chen had already submitted a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. Director Chen received a written reply from Edwardes yesterday, stating that the increase or decrease of rickshaws in the Public Concession must be a natural trend based on the number of motor vehicles and the smoothness of traffic. With motor vehicles and trams crowding the roads, and the existing 10,000 rickshaws often having empty vehicles vying for passengers on the streets, it would be difficult to reissue the 5,161 rickshaw licenses that were withdrawn in 1924, as this would obstruct traffic. The Council shares the concern for relieving unemployed rickshaw pullers, but rickshaw pullers must be familiar with the Municipal Council's traffic regulations, and not just anyone can pull a rickshaw, with the primary goal of ensuring the safety of passengers. After a meeting of the special committee, it was unanimously agreed that, under the current circumstances, not only can rickshaw licenses not be added, but the future development of traffic in the concession may lead to a reduction of rickshaws to 5,000 by 1936. Therefore, pulling a rickshaw cannot be a temporary occupation for unemployed workers. For the above reasons, it is difficult to add licenses. It is reported that Director Chen has already reported back to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>Passenger Jumps Overboard</p>
<p>Passenger Jumps Overboard at Sanjia Shoal</p>
<p>Searched the Sea for One Hour Without Success</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson shipping company's northern route Faoshing steamer, southbound from Tianjin, arrived at Sanjia Shoal outside Wusong Port at 2 PM yesterday when a passenger of unknown name suddenly jumped overboard. Upon hearing the news, the ship's captain immediately ordered the ship to stop and lower the boat to search the sea. After searching for about an hour without finding any trace, the ship continued its voyage to Shanghai. According to passengers on the ship, the person who jumped overboard was about fifty years old, and his name was unknown. The reason for jumping overboard is also unclear. It was also said that the Faoshing steamer went off course by forty nautical miles in the Black Ocean, and the ship was delayed for one hour off the coast due to someone jumping overboard. As a result, the ship did not arrive at the port until 6 PM yesterday, five hours late.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Life Problems <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Young Woman Hangs Herself</p>
<p>Wife Unwilling to Live as Guests in Another's Home</p>
<p>Good Couple Ends Poorly</p>
<p>A young woman from Haizhou, Ji Yin, had a slight disagreement with her husband and suddenly hanged herself at home the evening before last. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>A Loving Couple Ji Xiaoshunzi, 26 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, rented a room at No. 21 Yude Lane, Dongchang Road, Pudong. He works as a laborer at the British American Tobacco factory in Lujiazui, earning 15 yuan a month. His wife, Yin, named Lindi, is from Haizhou, 29 years old, and quite beautiful. They married in April last year. Yin used to work at the Nichihua Cotton Mill, but stopped working due to illness. They have no children. The couple's relationship was usually quite good.</p>
<p>Life Problems Recently, Ji found the cost of living quite high and his income insufficient to make ends meet. Therefore, he went to his older brother, Xiaowuzi's home, to discuss ways to save expenses. His brother and sister-in-law both advised Xiaoshunzi to pay for his meals at their home, so he would not have to live alone and save money. Xiaoshunzi was pleased to hear this and went home to discuss it with his wife. Unexpectedly, Yin strongly opposed it. Ji was very upset when he saw his wife reject this arrangement, and a quarrel broke out between them. From then on, Ji ate at his sister-in-law's house every day, while Yin borrowed food from her mother's home nearby because she had no money for food. Recently, they had another conflict over this issue, and a tragedy suddenly occurred.</p>
<p>Crying Over Her Corpse Yin did not agree with her husband's opinion, which angered him. Overwhelmed with anger, she suddenly entered the room and hanged herself from a beam at 5 PM the day before last, while her husband was still at work. After a while, a female landlord returned home and found the bedroom door tightly closed. Suspecting something was wrong, she tried to push it open but could not. She immediately called neighbors to move the door, and they saw Yin hanging from the beam. They were panicked and immediately rushed to inform her mother and brother. They took Yin down, but she was already dead. There was no way to save her. Soon after, Xiaoshunzi also returned from work and was distraught to see the tragedy. He held his wife's body and cried loudly. He was then taken to the Third District Police Station for questioning.</p>
<p>Mother's Family Quarrel After Yin's death, her mother, Yin Xu, and her brother, Yin Bukang, insisted that Xiaoshunzi abused her to death and claimed that they wanted to file a lawsuit in court to seek justice. Xiaoshunzi had just returned from the Third District when he was grabbed and argued with. Later, Xiaoshunzi's older brother, Xiaowuzi, came forward to mediate, agreeing to bury the deceased with generous funds and hire a Taoist priest to perform a service for her soul. The deceased's family then had no objection and agreed to request the court to waive the autopsy yesterday. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Xiaoshunzi bought a coffin without consulting his wife's family. His mother-in-law, Xu, believed that the coffin material was not good and insisted on replacing it, but she failed. Negotiations broke down again overnight.</p>
<p>Beating the Local Constable Yesterday morning, Xie Along, the local constable of the twenty-fourth ward and twenty-fourth district, went to investigate, intending to report to the local court for an autopsy. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at the scene, the deceased's family did not recognize him as the local constable and ordered him not to make a public announcement. Xie debated with them, which resulted in him being punched twice by the family. Xie believed that it was unreasonable for him to be beaten for no reason, and he had never heard of a corpse's family beating a local constable, so he went to the Third District to report the incident. The district sent a police officer to take the deceased's brother, Bukang, to the district and send him to the local court for questioning. The matter was soon resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Autopsy Today At the same time, the local constable filed a request for the court to send someone across the river to perform an autopsy. The court originally scheduled to send a prosecutor and an inspector to the scene this afternoon, but because it was too late, it was changed to 9 AM today. Therefore, the body was not yet placed in the coffin last night.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Suicide Due to Life's Pressures <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Chen Liang, also known as Hongfu, was a 23-year-old native of Ningxian, Zhejiang. He worked at the Yufeng Lumberyard at the north end of Xijiaxing Road Bridge on Dixiwei Road. He married Xu, who is now 19 years old, and they rented a house together at No. 8 Yuanchang Road, Hujiamu Bridge. Chen Liang earned a monthly salary of eight yuan, which was used to support the family, but he often worried that it was not enough. Xu also worked as a servant to supplement their income. At 3 PM the day before last, Chen left the store alone. He did not return home that evening and stayed overnight at the Xinxin Hotel on Xin Jia Road, Dixiwei Road. At about 9 AM yesterday morning, the tea boy knocked on the door to clean, and Chen replied from inside that he still needed to sleep, so the tea boy did not enter. He waited until noon and still did not see him get up, so he felt something was wrong. He pried the door open and saw that Chen was lying stiff on the bed. He touched him and found that he was already dead. The accountant then reported to the Fifth District First Precinct Public Concession, which sent police to investigate. A suicide note was found in the room, addressed to his wife, Xu Meixin, which read, "I am unable to support you, causing you to work day and night, yet we still struggle to make ends meet. It is better for me to end my life. You don't need to be sad. Our fate is over. It is okay for you to marry again." Below were the words "April 9th" and "Your weeping elder brother, Hongfu." The deceased's body was covered with bluish-purple congealed blood, suggesting that he had committed suicide by inhaling fumes. According to those who knew Chen Liang, Chen had borrowed three yuan from a friend, and his wife asked him the day before yesterday if he had returned it, which caused them to quarrel. Chen may have been overwhelmed with grief and felt the pressure of life, leading him to take this drastic measure.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Four Banks Robbery Case <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Robbers Additionally Charged with Two Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>Victim in One of the Kidnapping Cases Personally Attends Court</p>
<p>Fu A-quan Admits to Kidnapping</p>
<p>Killing Western Police Officer Not Intentional</p>
<p>The case of the robbery of the Four Banks' treasury and the subsequent arrest and interrogation of the perpetrators by the police has been reported in detail. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun of the Special District Court again interrogated the defendants. According to the police lawyer, the defendants were not only charged with robbery but also with two counts of kidnapping. Fu A-quan was further charged with shooting and killing Western Police Officer Harris at No. 247 Guizhou Road on the night of March 4th of last year. Only Lou Kenzai, the victim of one of the kidnapping cases, personally attended the court. Sheng Jinxin had returned to Qingpu and was represented by Bao Cailiang. Lou testified that he was seventeen years old, from Ningbo, and resided at No. 12 Mendeland Road in Shanghai, working at the Quan Gong Bank. Last year, he studied at the Qianye Public School on Rue du Consulat. On the morning of November 4th, at 9 AM, he, his brother, and a classmate were traveling to school in his personal car, No. 328. Upon arriving at the school gate, his brother got out of the car first. While he was still in the car, four robbers suddenly boarded the car. Three held handguns and drove the driver, Li A-yue, out of the car. One robber drove away at high speed. After a long time, the car stopped. The robbers dragged him into a Western-style house, where he stayed for eighteen days. Fortunately, the cook in the robbers' den, who had previously worked for his uncle, released him in the middle of the night. After escaping, he learned that the robbers' den was located at No. 138 Avenue Albert in the French Concession and that three robbers, Zhou Guiwu and others, had been arrested by the police and sentenced to death. He could not identify whether any of the defendants in this case were among those who had kidnapped him. Fu A-quan admitted that he and Li Meidi had kidnapped Lou. According to his accomplice, Da A-ge, they received a ransom of 30,000 yuan, of which he received 2,000 yuan. He also stated that he, Shen A-bing, Xiao Sanzi, and others kidnapped Sheng, hiding the ransom note in a small boat in Beixinjing. The case was solved by the security guards. However, the shooting of the Western police officer was organized by Yang A-mao, who was at large. The previous night, Yang had a conflict with a security guard at the Xinxin Company, so the next night he gathered more than twenty people to retaliate. At the time, handguns were fired randomly, and there was no intention to shoot the Western police officer. Yang fled after the incident. Judge Sun then questioned the defendant Yuan Genfa. Yuan did not admit to any of the charges and cried constantly, begging for a quick death. The defendants were ordered to be returned to custody, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<p>Compensation Sought and Criminal Prosecution Requested</p>
<p>Car Driver Still Trying to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Li Pengsun, an inspector of the Cigarette Tax Bureau, was riding a Route 17 trolleybus to the Wada Tobacco Company on Xihuade Road at 2:30 PM on the tenth of last month. After getting off at the stop, he was struck by car No. 4476, driven by Zhao Jinchun, a driver for the Gonghe Foreign Firm at No. 1 Guangdong Road.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Li Pengsun sustained injuries and died soon after. At the time of the accident, the car driver did not sound the horn, resulting in the death. The deceased's brother, Li Wusheng, claims that his brother earned a monthly salary of 70 yuan, which supported several family members. Now, Zhao's negligence has caused his death. He has engaged lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a criminal complaint against Zhao, requesting that he be punished according to the law. In addition, he is seeking 12,600 yuan in damages, calculated based on the deceased's ability to work for another fifteen years, at 70 yuan per month. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun of the Special District Court opened a hearing to summon the defendant. The defendant also engaged lawyer Shen Yuesheng for his defense. First, the plaintiff and Zhao Huahai, the General Affairs Section Chief of the Cigarette Tax Bureau, testified about the circumstances of the accident. The defendant Zhao Jinchun stated that on that day, he was driving a Westerner from the Gonghe Foreign Firm to No. 14 Taopeng Road. He was driving back when he passed Xihuade Road, and it was raining heavily. The deceased rushed out from behind the trolleybus, heading from north to south. Upon seeing this, he sounded the horn and immediately stopped the car, but it was too late. Afterward, police officer No. 1865 arrived and ordered him to take the deceased to Tongren Hospital, where he died the next day. The court has verified that it was due to his own carelessness and not his fault. Lawyer Shen also stated that the police initially intended to file a public prosecution in this case. However, after the examination and investigation of the accident site, there was no evidence, so they did not prosecute. Judge Sun adjourned the hearing for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>Woman Grieving and Driven Mad</p>
<p>Incoherent Speech, Utterly Miserable</p>
<p>Sent to Charity Organization for Care</p>
<p>Zhou Jin, a 34-year-old woman from Yuyao, Zhejiang, had been married to her husband, Zhou Jinmao, for over ten years. They had a nine-year-old daughter named A-mei. The couple came to Shanghai from their hometown in 1925 due to difficult living conditions. They resided in Caojiadu, Huxi. Her husband, Jinmao, worked as a laborer at the Zhentai Pier in the town, while she worked as a maid. The family of three was able to make a living temporarily. In recent years, prices have soared, and the cost of living has increased, leading to debt accumulation. In the autumn of last year, Jinmao was unable to repay his creditors and sold his daughter, A-mei, to someone. His wife loved her only daughter dearly and tried to stop him with all her might, but it was to no avail. She was grief-stricken by the loss of her daughter, and tears often wet her collar. She was filled with sorrow and despair. Jinmao also felt a sense of guilt and regret for having sold his daughter, as he was forced to do so. Soon after, he became seriously ill and bedridden. He eventually succumbed to his illness in November of last year. The woman was devastated by the loss of her beloved daughter and husband. Day after day, she grieved, which turned into depression, which then led to mental confusion and a nervous breakdown. She soon became mentally ill, eating irregularly and wandering aimlessly. Her madness was evident on the streets every day. Yesterday morning at about 1 AM, she was again acting madly in the Laobosheng Road area, babbling and crying miserably. A patrolling police officer noticed her and took her back to the Sixth District Police Station. After repeated questioning by District Chief Duan, she initially remained silent, only shedding tears. She then vaguely mentioned the above situation and said that she had worked as a helper at Mr. Zhang's office in the Dafeng Yarn Factory for a few months. However, she was incoherent about the rest and did not know her address. District Chief Duan believed that the madwoman had been stimulated and was pitiful. He prepared a document to send her to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to a charity organization for care.</p>

<p>Mother Died When She Was Four Months Old</p>
<p>Stepmother Abused Her and Forced Her to Marry</p>
<p>Raised by Her Aunt, Who Verbally Promised Her in Marriage</p>
<p>Wrote a Letter of Inquiry, But Entrusted the Wrong Person</p>
<p>Finally Achieved a Happy Ending After Many Hardships</p>
<p>The Woman's Family Background Ren Suzhen (nickname Mao Yuan), a 17-year-old woman from Ningbo, has a modern short haircut and is extremely beautiful. Her father, Ren Meifu, 56 years old, owns the Renshengji Watch Shop at the entrance of Huaqing Lane, East Tutang, Central Hongqiao, Xihuade Road. Suzhen's mother died when she was only four months old. Her aunt, Ms. Xin, from No. 140 Yipin Lane, Zhabei, raised her and sent her to school. Ji Caiyun, with whom she lived, had a son named Yifei, who was the same age as Suzhen and from the same hometown. Whenever they returned home from school, they would play together in the courtyard, like siblings. As a result, she was favored by Ms. Xin, who verbally promised her in marriage to Ji Yifei. Suzhen had long accepted this arrangement, but the engagement had not yet been formally arranged. In the spring of 1928, Yifei joined the postal service as a trainee, preventing the two from seeing each other morning and night. Ms. Xin, her aunt, passed away last winter, and Suzhen dropped out of school. This spring, she went to live with her father in Hongkou. However, her stepmother, Ms. Zhang, 37 years old,</p>
<p>Abused Her Regularly Recently, Ms. Zhang arranged for Suzhen to marry her sister's husband's younger brother (a car driver). Suzhen vowed not to comply, causing the mother and daughter to become like strangers. Yifei was depressed after leaving Suzhen. His parents learned the inside story and asked someone to propose marriage to the Ren family. However, the stepmother, Ms. Zhang, repeatedly refused, and the marriage was put on hold. Suzhen, living in an authoritarian family, spent her days in tears, repeatedly wanting to see Ji and pour out her heart. Chen Yonggen, a tailor who lived nearby, knew about the matter and offered to deliver letters. Suzhen then wrote a</p>
<p>Letter of Inquiry (original letter recorded below) on the 28th of last month and entrusted Chen's wife, A-ying, to deliver it. She soon received a reply stating, "I have received your letter. I hope you can come to the Fenghua Hotel on the 30th of this month to discuss everything," etc. Suzhen was overjoyed after receiving the letter. She went to the Fenghua Hotel with Chen's wife, A-ying, to wait. Ji did not arrive for a long time, and Ji's heart was full of doubt. She was afraid of being blamed by her stepmother if she went home. Just as she was in a dilemma, A-ying's younger brother suddenly drove a car to her residence, and she rode with him to stay at Eight Mile Bridge in Yangshupu for one day. The next morning, Chen Yonggen took Suzhen to Pudong to look for a friend. In the afternoon, they crossed the river again and stayed at the Nanyang Hotel on Minguo Road for one day. However, Suzhen refused to sleep, instead,</p>
<p>Waiting All Night Qin Qiusheng (21 years old, living in Tushanwan and doing advertising business), a friend of Chen, came and took her to the home of his relative, Qian Zusheng, who ran a grocery store in Tushanwan, to stay temporarily. On the day before yesterday (5th), Zhang Xiangrui, the patrol chief of the local police station, took her back to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District, believing that the woman's origins were unclear and her behavior suspicious. After a detailed interrogation by Chief Xu Yan, she confessed the above situation and said that she had been deceived this time. Fortunately, there was no coercion, and she was able to maintain her innocence, which was gratifying. However, she did not want to go home and asked the chief to</p>
<p>Uphold Justice Otherwise, She Would Kill Herself Here As She Spoke, Tears Ran Down Her Face. Chief Xu took pity on her and temporarily took her in. He sent Patrol Chief Wang Zhentang to arrest Qin Qiusheng, Chen Yonggen, and his wife, A-ying, and confiscated the original letter, ordering them to be temporarily detained pending investigation. He also notified the Ren and Ji families to come to the station. Ji Yifei confessed that he was 17 years old, lived at No. 140 Yipin Lane, and was currently a trainee at the postal service. He knew nothing about the above situation. However, regarding the marriage, Ms. Xin had indeed agreed to it when she was alive. This spring, he had asked a matchmaker to propose marriage to the Ren family, but Ms. Zhang had demanded too much money for tea, so the marriage was called off. He pleaded with the chief to make a beautiful thing come true. Chief Xu learned the truth and sought the consent of both families, arranging for the marriage to be completed according to the original agreement that day. Suzhen was taken back by her maternal grandmother, Tang Yue, to await the Ji family's wedding. Qin Qiusheng and the other three detainees were released at the request of the woman's older sister, Ren Rongchang, and were not pursued further. After each signed a pledge, the love story of a woman seeking her husband came to an end.</p>
<p>Original Letter Recording Brother Yixiang, After my aunt passed away, I moved to my home, but my stepmother is unkind and often abuses me. Recently, she arranged for me to marry someone else. I absolutely refuse to comply. At that time, my aunt had already promised me to you, so how can she break the engagement later? Even if the sea dries up and the rocks crumble, my determination will never waver. I hope you can quickly come up with a good plan to fulfill this wish. Otherwise, I will follow my kind mother to the underworld. Don't worry about me. Your weeping sister, Suzhen, April 28th.</p>

<p>Zhang Shouyong, the Vice Minister of Finance, resides at No. 10 Shengping Street, Moerming Road. His eldest son, Xinglian, teaches at Guanghua University on Da Xi Road, and his third son, Hualian, also studies at Guanghua. On the morning of the 14th of last month, Zhang Xinglian drove his Citroen car to take Hualian to school and to pick up Professor De, Ms. Zhang Xingni, at No. 3 Gubat Road. When the car reached Da Xi Road, four surveyors were measuring the road with measuring tapes in front of the car, blocking Zhang's way. In fact, these four people were disguised as kidnappers. After the car stopped, they drew their handguns and forced all three into a car that had been parked on the side of the road, and drove away quickly. At Columbia Road, the kidnappers let Ms. Zhang go, but gave her an English letter to hand over to the Zhang residence. After the Zhang brothers were kidnapped, their family reported the incident to the police and asked them to investigate. It was not until early morning the day before yesterday that the two bribed the kidnappers heavily and escaped from the kidnappers' den and returned home. Their story is briefly recorded as follows.</p>

<p>The Anhui-Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association has received telegrams from various counties in Anhui and Ningbo, stating that grain prices in their hometowns have risen sharply, grain supplies are exhausted, and people are in danger of starvation. The situation is extremely critical. Therefore, an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee was convened yesterday (7th), resolving that, in addition to telegrahing the provincial government to order the counties to take measures to maintain the situation and strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and smuggling, a separate telegram was sent to the Jiangxi Provincial Government, petitioning it to order neighboring counties under its jurisdiction to lift the ban and allow passage. It was also decided to convene a general meeting immediately to properly allocate relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Under the Supervision of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Business Conditions of the Xianghua Electric Company</p>
<p>There are many factories within the business area of the Xianghua Electric Company, so the electricity consumption has increased rapidly in recent years. The total revenue of the company in 1928 was more than 86,000 yuan, which increased to more than 123,000 yuan in 1929, an increase of about 47%. In terms of power generation projects, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has repeatedly guided improvements, and fuel has been gradually saved. The average power generation in 1928 consumed 0.084 pounds of diesel per kilowatt-hour, which was reduced to 0.07 pounds in 1929. Fuel is a major expenditure for power plants. With fuel savings, expenses will naturally decrease. Therefore, the company's electricity revenue in 1929 increased by 47% compared with 1928, while expenses only increased by 34%. However, the Bureau of Public Utilities believes that small power plants generating electricity themselves are ultimately not as economical as purchasing electricity from large power plants for resale. Therefore, last autumn, the company was instructed to negotiate with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company for power supply. Soon, the agreement was reached. Since January 1930, the company has stopped generating electricity and receives power from the Zhabei Company. From now on, Xianghua Company does not need to add machines, and the electricity supply can be expanded at any time. The work is simple, and expenses are reduced. According to the company's estimate, it can save more than 7,000 yuan per year. The business prospects are even more promising. As for Zhabei, it has one more large customer, and the business will inevitably improve greatly. Therefore, the Public Utilities Bureau's power supply plan is beneficial to both Zhabei and Xianghua, and its main purpose is to directly reduce power plant costs and indirectly reduce user burdens.</p>

<p>Rescuing Hostage Zhang Zhujiang</p>
<p>Capturing Bandits Wang Jinyi and Gu Liansheng</p>
<p>At 10:15 AM the day before yesterday (the 7th), the Taiping Township Security Corps branch of the Punan Nanhui County, opposite Pengjia Ferry on the west side of Minhang, and the Ninth Branch Bureau of the Zhagang Public Security Bureau, received reports that a large gang of bandits was hiding a hostage in a house in Majiatang Village, west of Taiping Town. After receiving the report, the corps branch captain Ye Yuyu personally led capable corps members, and the Ninth Branch Bureau of Public Security dispatched patrol officer Shao Jingzhi, along with four plainclothes officers, to secretly gather and search the area. Captain Ye, Officer Shao, and others rushed into the bandit den, rescued hostage Zhang Zhujiang on the spot, and captured bandits Wang Jinyi and Gu Liansheng. They immediately took the hostage Zhang Zhujiang and bandits Wang Jinyi and Gu Liansheng back to the branch headquarters. Under interrogation by Captain Ye, the hostage Zhang Zhujiang confessed that he was 66 years old, a native of Shaoxiangshan, Songjiang, and was kidnapped on the night of February 11. The bandit Wang Jinyi confessed that he was 62 years old, a native of outside the East Gate of Gaoyou, Jiangbei, and Gu Liansheng confessed that he was 38 years old, a local. They also confessed that there were three other accomplices involved in the case. After hearing the confessions, Captain Ye immediately dispatched personnel to pursue the other bandits and escorted Wang Jinyi and Gu Liansheng to the Taiping Township Security Corps headquarters in Nandabridge Town. After interrogation by the corps leader He Baoyi, he immediately dispatched a team and turned them over to the Ninth Branch Bureau of Public Security, led by the corps officer. The bureau chief of the Ninth Branch Bureau of Public Security, Gao Liquan, was escorting the rescued hostage Zhu Jizhou and bandit's wife Zhuang Wu from Dongdu Township, Chonggu Town, into the city. After a brief interrogation by Officer Shao, he prepared documents and used a private boat to escort the hostage Zhang Zhujiang, bandits Wang Jinyi and Gu Liansheng to the Nanhui County Government for review.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Daughter Refuses Marriage Due to Quarrel <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Son-in-Law is Deaf and Stupid</p>
<p>Daughter Unwilling to Marry</p>
<p>About six miles west of Sanlintang, Pudong, Pang Quanxing, the younger brother of Pang Zhenxing, a farmer from Pangjiaquan, 24th Bao, 2nd Tu, is 24 years old this year. When he was nine years old, Zhang Laozhong and Zhang Afu acted as matchmakers and arranged a marriage with Zhang Axiu, the daughter of Zhang Lu from Dongzhai nearby. Because the Qian family was in financial difficulty, they had not yet married. Now Pang Zhenxing believes that his brother is getting older, and it would be wrong not to find a way to marry him. Therefore, he repeatedly asked the matchmaker to notify the Kun family to choose a day for the wedding. However, the Kun family firmly refused and tore up the red invitation. Seeing this, Pang Zhenxing realized that something was wrong and filed a complaint with the local court requesting that the marriage contract be valid. Yesterday morning, presiding judge Guo Shouyi opened the sixth court for trial. Pang Zhenxing testified that he was 28 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Pangjiaquan, Pudong. My younger brother Quanxing is 24 years old this year and currently works in ship repairing. He also stated the previous situation. The defendant Zhang Axiu testified that she was 24 years old and was deceived by the matchmaker in the past and hastily agreed to the marriage. However, her fiancé, Pang Quanxing, is deaf and stupid, so she is unwilling to marry him. The judge then asked the plaintiff, "Why didn't your brother come today?" Zhenxing replied, "My brother Quanxing is indeed deaf. He became deaf at the age of fifteen due to illness. He is out working today, so he did not come to court." Zhang Lu, 50 years old, testified, "Axiu is my daughter. She was deceived by the matchmaker in the past and only received 16 yuan in gifts, nothing else. It was not until last year that I learned that my son-in-law is deaf and stupid. Therefore, my daughter has repeatedly cried and quarreled with me to cancel the marriage. This kind of marriage, without her consent, she is unwilling to marry, and I have no way. Please investigate." The judge attempted to reconcile the parties in court, but they refused. Therefore, he invited Prosecutor Xu to present his opinion in court. The judge then announced the end of the debate and adjourned the hearing for judgment.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at about 5:00 PM, police officers Wang Chengwen and Yang Daocen from Post No. 3, Nanyang Bridge, Second District, Nanshi, along with inspectors Guo Zhenliang and Guo Chenghai, were inspecting pedestrians and passing vehicles near the iron shed entrance of Nanyang Bridge when they suddenly saw a white-licensed car (Shanghai 920, Concession 17530) driving from north to south. Several young men resembling students were sitting in the car. The police officers ordered the car to stop and searched each person. None of them had any prohibited items on their bodies. However, one of the teenagers looked flustered. They then ordered everyone to get out of the car and searched the car. They found a paper package containing a five-inch, five-peaked lotus-style revolver in the gap next to the seat on the left. There were no bullets. They asked the people if they had a gun license, and none of them did. They immediately took the car and everyone to the police station. After questioning each person one by one, District Chief Wang learned that the teenager carrying the gun was named Miao Wenquan, 19 years old, from Zhejiang. He is currently studying at the School of Commerce at Gordon Road, Public Concession. His father's name is Miao Zhixiang, who used to work at the Hanyang Arsenal in Hubei, serving as the director of the bullet manufacturing department. The gun was brought from Hubei to Shanghai in his early years and hidden at home. Later, he went out of town. He (Miao claimed) then took the gun to school to play with. A few days ago, his father suddenly returned home and learned that he had taken the gun to school. Fearing that it would cause trouble, his father ordered him to take it back immediately. This morning, his friends Tang Jinsheng, etc., came to school to play ball. In the afternoon, they went out together, so he took the gun along to take it back to his father's house in Lujiabang for storage. Unexpectedly, not long after leaving school, they encountered rain and hired a car at the Hengmao Car Company on Jing'an Temple Road. They were caught on Nanyang Bridge. The others confessed that their names were Tang Jinsheng, 20 years old, Tang Xianglin, 20 years old, Ren Mingjun, 22 years old, and Wu Zhihao, 21 years old, all locals. They all said that they were friends with Miao. This morning, they went to Miao's place to play. In the afternoon, when they left school, they saw Miao carrying a handgun. They all advised him not to carry it, but Miao did not listen. The others knew nothing about it. The driver, Yu Asi, 29 years old, from Yangzhou, confessed that they hired his car to go to Lujiabang, Nanshi, and he did not know they were carrying a handgun. After hearing the confessions, District Chief Wang immediately prepared a document and submitted it along with the car to the Judicial Section of the General Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Suddenly Wants a Divorce After Cohabitation</p>
<p>Alimony of 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Paid in Four Installments</p>
<p>Li Yizhang, from Meixian, Guangdong, used to work in politics and is now unemployed in Shanghai, residing at his brother's house on Maigen Road. Li's brother used to be in the military and is now sighing about his situation, but he is still wealthy and does not worry about food and clothing. Yizhang is over thirty years old and originally married Ms. Tian Shenyi from Huaicheng. Tian came from a prominent family and studied from a young age. After marrying Li, because Li was ambitious and wanted to make his mark, Ms. Tian often stayed at her mother's house to focus on her studies, so Li would not have to worry about family matters. It has been eight years, and they still have no children. Last year, Li resigned from his position as secretary of a certain agency in Xiamen and came to Shanghai. Tian also came to Shanghai, hoping to enjoy the pleasures of family life from then on. Unexpectedly, this year, Li developed a lack of faith in his marriage with Tian and proposed a divorce. Tian also felt that Li was deeply addicted to gambling and did not provide for her, making it difficult to commit to a lifetime together. Therefore, she agreed to the proposed divorce, but proposed that she should be given a considerable amount of alimony to support her life. Li agreed to give 2,000 yuan, but stated that he would pay it when his finances were sufficient, and sent Tian a letter. This issue could have been resolved on its own, but for some reason, it still went through legal channels. Tian Shenyi appointed a lawyer and sued Li Yizhang in the Special District Local Court for abandonment and requested a divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang opened a court session and summoned both parties and their lawyers. The divorce itself was not a point of contention between the two parties. The plaintiff, Tian Shenyi, argued that the defendant should provide alimony after the divorce. The amount was initially requested at 5,000 yuan, then reduced to 3,000 yuan. Finally, following the judge's advice, the defendant was ordered to pay 2,000 yuan. Li Yizhang repeatedly claimed poverty, saying that although he was willing to give 2,000 yuan at the time, he would have to wait until he found a job and then pay. He currently had no financial resources. If he made a promise rashly and could not pay at the time, he was afraid that he would be sued again. Judge Yang ordered him to pay the 2,000 yuan in four installments within one year, with one installment every three months, and each installment being 500 yuan. The first installment, as the plaintiff had an urgent need, was to be paid 200 yuan within two weeks, and 300 yuan after three months, with the rest paid in installments. This would be easier to do, and Li finally agreed. Thus, the case was settled through reconciliation.</p>

<p>The Weile Garden, which promotes bicycle racing, started construction last week. The track and grandstand are modeled after those in the United States and France, and are solid, grand, and unparalleled. Other plans have also been drafted and will be printed soon for review by the public. The purpose of the garden is pure, dedicated to providing citizens with leisure and increasing entertainment after work. Gambling and money-related activities are strictly prohibited by the directors. Mr. Pang Meng, the general manager of the garden, recently invited Mr. Li Silian, who is enthusiastic about promoting sports and has achieved results, to be the honorary secretary. Mr. Li assisted in planning and spared no effort. In addition, Mr. Smith, a director of the YMCA sports department, was invited to be the honorary coach. According to Mr. Li, Shanghai lacks proper entertainment venues, leading many young people to indulge in alcohol, sex, and gambling after work, resulting in many falling into degradation. If public games can be promoted more, and good habits are cultivated, then social stability will surely make significant progress. In addition to bicycle races, the garden will also hold motorcycle races at the same time. Everything is being arranged, and time is set aside for motorcycle racers to practice. Those who love this sport can contact the garden, and there is no fee. Motorcycle races have long been popular in Europe and the United States, with intense interest. The results of the competition on the wooden track are even more satisfactory. The summer opening will surely cause a sensation in the whole city.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Xu Peikun's Gold is Expensive, Silver is Cheap Relief Plan (Continued) <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>(5) The Power of Shanghai Gold Speculators</p>
<p>In addition to domestic conditions, international payments, and East exchange rate reasons, there is another important comparable force, which is gold speculation. The Shanghai gold price can fluctuate depending on the East exchange rate, London silver bullion, or other reasons, but sometimes its fluctuations are completely unaffected by any overseas market and are absolutely based on China's domestic conditions and the psychology of domestic speculators. The changes in the gold price in the second month of the lunar calendar were of this type. In addition, cross rates between the British and Japanese currencies and between the Japanese and American currencies also have considerable influence on the changes in the gold price. However, it is also the case for the Shanghai silver exchange rate. In other words, speculators make their gold transactions based on the above-mentioned cross rates.</p>
<p>(6) Reasons for Recent Changes in Silver Exchange Rates</p>
<p>At this point, we can examine the forces controlling the Shanghai silver exchange rate. Since the beginning of the exchange rate turmoil in February, the gold price and the silver exchange rate behind it have fluctuated abnormally. First, there were various rumors such as the imposition of taxes on the import of silver bullion by India and the United States, and the dumping of unusable currency accepted by India and Annam. Afterwards, there was the actual implementation of the policy of dealing with silver bullion by governments of various overseas countries. All of these are related to the destruction of the local gold market. Recently, rumors of restrictions on the import of silver bullion by the Chinese government have also affected the gold market. This phenomenon can only be explained by the principle of speculation, and there is no other principle that can be understood.</p>
<p>(7) Invention of the Complex Principle of Silver Exchange Rate Plunge</p>
<p>In summary, the Shanghai silver exchange rate is affected by international payments, East exchange rate, gold speculation, London silver bullion prices, and many other intangible forces. Among these forces, except for international payments, the rest can be included in the item of speculation. In principle, the Shanghai silver exchange rate is restricted by the international payments principle and the speculation principle. However, because the latter's influence has been particularly significant recently, this exchange rate phenomenon can be purely explained by the latter alone. The author firmly believes that other reasons are all useless and easily lead to incorrect results. Furthermore, this complex speculation principle is applicable not only to the past and present, but also to the future before China's financial system is reformed.</p>
<p>(D) Relief Plans Amidst the Cry for Help</p>
<p>The gold standard issue is clearly the cause of the changes in the Shanghai silver exchange rate, so it is no longer difficult to devise a remedy. Many commentators vaguely say that the gold standard system is sufficient to remedy all difficulties, but the author does not believe that this strategy can relieve the current difficulties, and believes that it will intensify the current turmoil.</p>
<p>(1) The Gold Standard Issue</p>
<p>In principle, there is no doubt that China's currency system should be thoroughly reorganized. However, the implementation of the gold standard policy is not yet the time. The people of the country are now extremely poor and cannot withstand the suffering and sacrifice during the transitional period of reform. Adopting the gold standard system in a country with unclear politics and backward economy will inevitably make the current situation even more chaotic and cause violent expansion and contraction of the new currency system at home and abroad. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and other South American countries have all experienced this situation. Even in the European war and the post-war experiences of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Russia, it is clear that the exchange rate parity between gold-using countries can be disrupted. The Japanese gold after the 1923 earthquake gave us a lesson in complex exchange rate phenomena. In short, it is absurd to insist on a gold standard policy before our country is fully prepared to deal with all difficulties. As for the gold standard system as a currency policy, it should be discussed separately. (To be continued)</p>

<p>My neighbor, Hua Jingyun, is a theater enthusiast. He often associates with actors and is familiar with inside stories. Yesterday, he told me about Wang Xiaonong and Tan Jinpei. I am recording it on the left as material for this column. Wang Xiaonong was a scholar who lived as an actor. He excelled in literary talent. His poems, such as his self-composed verse on the Peach Blossom Fan, "Elegance is ceded to Yang Longyou, the peach blossoms are painted on the fan. But it's Yun Ting who collects it, now I leap onto the stage." It has been widely spread in artistic circles. Xiaonong once kept a myna bird in his residence. Xiaonong practiced singing songs, and the myna bird could imitate him. In the play "The Party Members' Monument," it could even use its tone and modulate the melody, moving and inspiring people. Compared with Sima Xiangru's parrot reciting the "Ode to Master Grand," it was not much inferior. Xiaonong loved it very much. One day, it was hanging in a cage in front of the eaves when it was suddenly clawed by a neighbor's cat. Because Xiaonong was protecting the myna bird, he moved away to avoid it. However, after being injured, the myna bird gradually stopped eating and died after a few days. Xiaonong was depressed and unhappy for months. His peers all considered him foolish.</p>
<p>The king of the acting world, Tan Xinpei, had an opium addiction. He would lie on a couch in his residence every day, enjoying the pleasure of exhaling smoke. After exhaling, he would get up in the room to practice his songs. This was to prepare for performing on stage in the evening. The four walls of the room were inlaid with sparkling mirrors. The king practiced singing, paying attention to his appearance. Every wave of his sleeve, every stamp of his foot, he had to do it in front of the mirror. Only when it was appropriate and satisfying would he stop. His dedication to practice was extraordinary. This is why the king is the king.</p>
<p>Treasures Awaiting Unearthing: The Precarious Situation in Northeast China</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Melon-Fighting Festival in Persia is Grand <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Persia is also an ancient country in the East. It borders the Red Sea and is adjacent to Arabia. To this day, it has not completely shed the customs of nomadic peoples.</p>
<p>Their custom of "melon fighting" is extremely interesting. Every year after the autumn harvest, melon-fighting festivals are held, large ones in cities and small ones in villages, all with organized melon-fighting associations for entertainment. However, it also contains a slight gambling element, similar to horse racing in Europe and America. Before the melon-fighting begins, the organizers choose a suitable location and date and announce it to the public. At the opening of the event, a table is placed in the center of the field. A melon is placed on the table, and people place bets, limited to red or white pulp. Those who guess correctly win a large prize, otherwise they simply shout in disappointment. After everyone has placed their bets, the organizers use a knife to cut open the melon to show the color of the pulp.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Persians, this is a traditional form of entertainment. Some people have become rich because of it, and many have been ruined by it. The matter is entertainment but close to gambling. It is said that the Persian government is planning to ban it.</p>
<p>This time, the Zhejiang immigrants going to the Northeast have set a precedent for opening up wasteland and colonizing the borders for the southeastern provinces. The first batch of 315 people has already set off on the Huayang Wheel. Mr. Hu Ruyin, one of the transportation staff, has been in the Northeast for more than 20 years, handling railway and civil engineering projects. The Zhejiang government requested him to go along, truly for the sake of the immigrants' happiness. According to Mr. Hu, the richness of natural resources in the Northeast and the intensity of a certain country's invasion are alarming. I will briefly record one or two of them below:</p>
<p>300 Yuan Turns into 400,000 Mr. Hu said that he knew a certain Lu person in the Eastern Province who brought 300 yuan to Fengtian (Mukden). Now he has 400,000 yuan and has become a wealthy man. Three brothers could not survive in their home province, so they sold their property and houses and gathered 300 yuan to go out to the pass. They used 200 yuan for a year's food and 100 yuan to lease a piece of land (land in the Eastern Province is measured in "fang," each "fang" being 480 mu). Using three donkeys and horses, the three brothers personally cultivated the land. After a year, it became productive land. Each mu of farmland was worth 20 yuan. Then he used the cultivated land to mortgage for 2,000 yuan from a large landlord and continued to lease 20 "fang." Continuing to cultivate one "fang" and mortgage it for several "fang." By last year, the three brothers had been out of the pass for ten years. After checking their assets, they had reached more than 400,000 yuan. Now they have divided it into three shares and are clearly three wealthy men.</p>
<p>The Xing'an Mountains are Full of Gold The Xing'an Mountains in the Eastern Province are a gold mining area in China. The Liaoning authorities have sent Zou Zuohua to develop it. Mr. Hu, who specializes in civil engineering, said that he personally went to the sandy areas of the Xing'an Mountains for a field survey. Panning the sand revealed a lot of red gold. Local indigenous people also pan for gold there, but the refining method is outdated. The labor is huge, and the gold obtained is meager. If a huge investment can be made to set up new gold panning machines, then gold will be everywhere, inexhaustible. Governor Zou is already planning it.</p>
<p>Natural Alkali Blocks Can Be Picked Up Everywhere Shanghai's Brunner Mond &amp; Co. sells alkali to our country, worth millions of dollars every year. But the alkali in the Three Eastern Provinces is as abundant as dung, everywhere. The residents there do not engage in agricultural work. They go to the alkali-producing areas every day to pick up these natural alkali blocks. Each child can pick up 2,000 cash, and adults can pick up 3,000 cash. This has fostered the laziness of these people. Recently, Britain and Japan are vying to buy it cheaply, but the Chinese people do not know about this product.</p>
<p>The Astonishing Output of Miscellaneous Grains The South Manchurian Railway only occupies the land of three counties. The entire line is only 200 kilometers long. Mr. Hu, who has worked on the railway for a long time, said that the railway's business relies entirely on transporting soybeans, millet, and sorghum. The freight is extremely cheap, but it can collect 6 million yuan in transportation fees every year. The huge amount of miscellaneous grains produced in these three counties is truly astonishing. However, 50% to 60% has not yet been developed and planted. The Income of the South Manchurian Railway is Frightening The daily income of the South Manchurian Railway has now reached 380,000 yuan. One month is 11.4 million yuan, and one year can collect 136.8 million yuan. Of this money, more than 90% comes from the Chinese people. The money leaked out over the years is unknown. Schools are also established along the way, specializing in enrolling Chinese students under the age of fifteen. Tuition is free. Chinese people who are fooled by their greed and profit send their children in. But they are taught Japanese. After graduation, they forget their ancestors and ancestors. It is no different from creating countless Japanese-influenced Chinese who invade China for the Japanese. Their plan is even more alarming.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Strange and Respectable Abducted Child Shi Long <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Last winter, Huajiaqiao Town, southeast of Kunshan, suddenly suffered a bandit robbery. In the end, several people were abducted, including three members of Hu Xinchen's family: Xinchen's sister-in-law, Xinchen's son, and Xinchen's grandson. The grandson was only ten years old. After being abducted, Xinchen's son falsely claimed to be a partner, not a Hu family member. He was lucky enough to be released halfway. This ten-year-old grandson was first put on a boat. Then he saw his father being abducted as well. If it were any other child, he would have cried out for his father. But this child acted as if he had nothing to do with him. He didn't cry or call out to his father. This is also strange. When Xinchen's son falsely claimed to be a partner and was released alone, if it were any other child, he would have cried out again. But this child looked at it as if he didn't see anything. If he had revealed any trace, Xinchen's son would not have been able to return. This was described in detail by the people of Huajiaqiao, who also said that this child was usually exceptionally intelligent. His ability to endure, not crying or calling out, was intended to protect his father. And his father was indeed saved. It can be said that he was filial. It is said that Xinchen's sister-in-law has also been released. Only this strange and respectable ten-year-old child, because the ransom was too high, could not be redeemed for a while. Now the bandits are being suppressed, their traces scattered, and there is no news. Xinchen and his son are weeping all day long, thinking of this good child. It is also pitiful.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Recording the Story of a Beggar Woman Who Became Rich Huang Yingdai <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>There are many ways to get rich. But I have never heard of getting rich by begging. Surprisingly, our Song (Songjiang) has a beggar woman who became rich by begging. The matter is bizarre, so I will briefly describe the circumstances of her getting rich on the left:</p>
<p>A certain beggar woman, her name is unknown, is from Song. She is already over sixty years old. Her family is extremely poor. She became a widow early, and her son is unfilial. Unable to make a living, she begged for a living. She must wait by the Malu Bridge every day, begging to passersby. Malu Bridge is the pier for Songjiang paddle boats, and it is also the only way to take a bus to the West Railway Station. Therefore, there is a lot of traffic to and fro. When a guest passes over Malu Bridge, the woman must follow him, unleashing her torrent of words, begging him until he reaches into his pocket and then leaves. I recall that when we were studying abroad, every time we returned to Song, we would see the woman begging people by Malu Bridge. The woman is quite stingy. She lives very frugally. Every day, what she gets from begging, besides buying steamed buns and vegetarian noodles to fill her stomach, she must gather and save the remaining money. At first, the woman did not know that begging could also lead to wealth. But money, as a thing, can accumulate little by little. And after the woman's savings reached one silver dollar, she would lend it to others, earning one dime of interest per month, which could earn one yuan and two dimes per year. The child is more than the mother, which is the so-called "loan sharking." Through such exploitation, in a few years, the woman had several hundred silver dollars in her hands. But the business of begging, the woman has never abandoned it. Over time, the more money she accumulated, the more people from all walks of life and wandering wanderers, when they were in need, would borrow from her. And the woman would always respond. For a time, the people of Song all knew that the woman had money. It became a beautiful story spread in the streets and alleys. In addition to lending money, the woman also used the remaining money to buy funeral clothes and funeral items for her afterlife. But her son was one of the unemployed vagrants. When he could not make ends meet, he would sneak into the house and secretly steal the woman's money and funeral clothes. When the woman discovered it, she would wail to the sky. Her appearance was quite sad. This happened several times. But the woman could not do anything about it. And because of her deep love for her son, she did not want him to go to jail. Now, there is no trace of the woman by Malu Bridge. Whether she is alive or not is unknown.</p>

<p>Chapter Eleven: A Talented Scholar Welcomes a Famous Courtesan, a Young Woman Marries into a High-ranking Family</p>
<p>At that time, thousands of heads were swarming... Everyone wanted to see if Mei Wanfang was truly worthy of his reputation. But he was only wearing a light cyan-gray patterned satin robe and a black satin mandarin jacket. His clothes were not particularly delicate. It was already the Republican era, and he had already cut his hair. With dark temples, red lips, starry eyes, and a sandalwood mouth, he was graceful and generous in dealing with people. People from the Mei party led him to meet several important people in the audience. There were also many older people. One was Mr. Zhang Jiqian from Nantong. They were already acquaintances and had met twice in Beijing. Another was Mr. Zhao Songjun from Wujin. He was once in Zhuang Shouxiang's staff and was a very popular figure. Therefore, some people who were jealous of him gave him a nickname, calling him "First-Rank Madam." Although Zhao Songjun had also been in Beijing before, Mei Wanfang was still young at that time and had long forgotten him. Today, Zhao Songjun brought his son, Yongguan, with him. Although Yongguan was young, he already had a love for beauty. He stared at Mei Wanfang without blinking. Mei Wanfang bowed to some of the guests, shook hands with others. Of course, he bowed to the older people, and shook hands with the younger ones. He bowed to Mr. Zhao Songjun. Yongguan quickly reached out his hand and shook hands with Wanfang. Everyone couldn't help laughing, saying that this young master would definitely be a loyal comrade in the Mei party in the future. At that time, Wanfang circulated among the guests for a while. He hadn't even sat down before he went backstage to prepare his makeup. An Kaidi from Wei Chun Garden had only temporarily set up a stage. Behind it was a pavilion built of glass. Because the garden owner would invite tourists to sip tea and sit on the ground here between spring and summer. A pool of flowing water, a few weeping willows. Everyone would invite a few friends to chat here. Now, that place had been turned into a theater. It was really too small. And it was a glass house. Everything could be seen around it. No matter what kind of play was performed, the performance on the stage was originally done for many audiences to see. Many of the situations in the dressing room were not willing to be seen by others. However, this theater was originally a glass house, with clear visibility inside and out. How could that be? Inevitably, many green curtains were used to cover it, making it completely airtight. But there were still many busybodies. They didn't like to look at the stage, but liked to look into the dressing room. Although these many glass windows were covered with curtains, there were always many gaps. They were all peering through the gaps in the curtains, wanting to see the original faces of these many actors. This is also a person's curiosity. At that time, the drama began. The sound of drums was noisy. Tables were set outside.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Finance: Heavy Silkworm Cocoon Demand, Price Surge Again <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Silver Discount Declines Sharply by Seven Cents</p>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, banks returned to full-day operations after the Spring Horse Racing season. They also engaged in large-scale trading of foreign exchange in the market, driven by robust demand for silkworm cocoons and smooth transactions. With three days' worth of business being processed in one day, the settlement of silver funds was particularly busy. However, due to excessive outflows, the "Hua Tou" (premium) for "Kuan Tou" (funds for withdrawal) became abundant, leading to a gradual decline in silver discounts. The strong surge in the price of "Li Jia" (interest rate) was due to the scarcity of sources and increased transfers. As a result, the situation formed a diverging trend.</p>
<p>Li Discount Prices (Foreign Li): The opening price was 7.2625 cents, a sharp increase of 1.125 cents compared to the previous day's opening. Trading was light in the afternoon, with prices seeing less competition. The final price remained the same as the opening. (Silver Discount) The trend was downward, and sentiment was soft. Discount bills were extremely congested due to the unique circumstances of "Du Tian" (a specific market condition). Consequently, silver discounts gradually fell. The opening price was 9 cents, but it only opened at 6 cents in the afternoon, a drop of 7 cents compared to the previous day's opening. "Hua Tou Jia Shui" (premium with interest) was white "Hua" (empty transaction) with no market due to excessive "Tou Chen" (backing).</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market: Jiangnan small silver coins had been chaotic for a long time, with no significant fluctuations. The opening price remained at 6.29 cents, with no trading. The afternoon price changed slightly by half a cent to 6.285 cents, with only 2,000 "Jiao" (units) traded. Guangdong small silver coins opened at 6.00875 cents, and the afternoon price increased by 0.125 cents. The afternoon price was even higher at 6.0125 cents, an improvement of 0.375 cents compared to the opening. Trading volume was 170,000 "Jiao" in the morning and 85,000 "Jiao" in the afternoon. Copper coins decreased by 2,500 "Wen" to 396 strings.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Exchange Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Yesterday, the banks' settlement amounts were quite complicated. Chinese merchants settled 3.78 million, while foreign merchants settled 3.67 million. There were over 2 million in special outflows, over 600,000 in telegraphic transfers, and a total of over 10 million in various commodity exchange taxes and mortgage exchanges. 2.1 million was withdrawn from the warehouse. Japanese banks settled over 6 million, with 300,000 withdrawn from the warehouse. Qianzhuang and silver public houses settled over 29 million, with over 3.9 million settled in Hua Tou funds. The settlement of remittances from various routes was over 1.2 million, with over 2 million received in cash. (Foreign Exchange) The volume of telegraphic transfers in the morning was 1.715 million and 758,000 in the afternoon. There was no market for banknotes in the morning, and 15,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 143,000 in the morning and 77,000 in the afternoon. Spot foreign exchange was 175,000 in the morning and 125,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 1.05 million in the morning and 550,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between foreign exchange accounts of various banks were over 1.8 million. The recovery and issuance of banknotes were 2.67 million. Customer funds were over 1.5 million, and funds for silkworm cocoons were over 2.2 million. Qianzhuang foreign exchange public houses settled over 4.7 million, and over 2.2 million was settled in foreign exchange Hua Tou funds. Foreign exchange borrowing was over 1.4 million, and interbank transactions of small qianzhuang were over 800,000.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Gold Standard Falls by 1.5 Taels <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Gold Exchange Resumes Full-Day Operations Yesterday, the Spring Horse Racing was over, and the gold industry operated as usual in both the morning and afternoon sessions. The gold market has shown a low peak. However, the former market contained 2.67 Qian (unit), and the latter market hovered around 508 Taels (unit), with only fluctuations of more than one tael. Foreign exchange seemed to be slightly circulating, and banks had occasional inflows and outflows. Fellow traders bought and sold tirelessly, but sellers accounted for most of them. For example, Taixing, Fuxing, and Yongyu were all selling short positions, while Wanxing, Shunli, and Hengxing were buying. Although large silver bars shrank in the morning, the active sellers showed weakness. In the future, exchange rates will be strong, and long positions will be added, tending to rise. From 508 Taels, it jumped to above 510 Taels. In the afternoon, sellers became active again, suddenly falling into a slump. Later, Zhifeng Yong and hedging all sold, while Shunli, Wanxing, and Taixiangyuan bought. However, sentiment was poor, and the trend seemed to be weakening. British silver bars shrank by another 1/16, silver prices shrank by 1/4, and exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Lowest Gross Price 0.76 Taels The June gold standard opened slightly lower by 3 Qian, estimated at 509.6 Taels. The gross price suddenly fell to 0.76 Taels, mainly because large accounts were selling off. Soon, hedging and others bought in, rising by 1 tael. There were few foreign exchange transactions, and the exchange rate remained at 0.789 Taels. The internal price initially declined and then stabilized. The June British gold closing was over 11 Pence (unit), but then it was only 10.9375 Pence. Hua Bank received 1.0625 Taels of June gold, so it immediately improved by 7 or 8 Qian. There were then fluctuations of several Qian, and it returned to 0.79 Taels at 10 o'clock. Since July US gold can be settled at 46.625 Yuan (unit), and June Japanese gold was sold by Sumitomo at 1.063125 Taels.</p>
<p>Reaching 10 Taels After 10 O'Clock Afterwards, Hengxing bought a lot, and British gold showed a tight trend again. Hua Bank absorbed 11 Pence of June gold to 10.9375 Pence. Mitsui bought 11 Pence of July, and Hua Bank and others sold forward Japanese gold at 1.065625 Taels, so the gold price suddenly rose sharply, jumping over two taels. After 10:30, it reached 10.3 Taels. However, many parties took the opportunity to sell off, unexpectedly shedding over 1 tael. After 11 o'clock, there were alternating rises and falls of 1 tael, advancing and retreating around 0.9 Taels. At noon, it closed at 508.9 Taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Continues to Be Weak The afternoon market opened at 0.9 Taels to 0.91 Taels. Afterwards, the sellers were very active, and the exchange rate did not change much. Mitsui bought forward Japanese gold at 1.05625 Taels, and bought forward British gold at 11.375 Pence. Until 2:45, it dropped to 0.778 Taels. After entering, retail buyers raised it by about two Taels, to 0.87 Taels. After 3 o'clock, it seemed weak and still in a slump. At 4 o'clock, it was about 0.8 Taels. Finally, it was slightly higher by a few Qian. At 4:30, it closed at 508.4 Taels, a decline of 1.5 Taels compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Quoted Price and Trading 10 Taels The maximum price of the day was 10.3 Taels, and the minimum price was 0.76 Taels, with a fluctuation of 2.7 Taels. Goods opened at 0.9 Taels, and closed at 0.86 Taels in the afternoon, and 0.89 Taels in the afternoon. The closing price was still 518.4 Taels, with a trading of around 10 Taels. Afternoon trading was still 10 Taels. The account registered 11 Taels in May and 0.9 Taels in June, with an additional 11 Taels in the afternoon and 10 Taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dalian Helped Enter More Than 5,000 Taels Various firms traded, including Yuancheng Yong, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Shengda, Yuanheng, and Yuantai. Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Yongfeng, Daxing, Yuda, Yiyu, Fuxingyong, etc. have all been sold. In the afternoon, Taihengyuan, Shengda, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanheng, Yuanyu Yong, etc. all entered, while Dadecheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuantai, and retail investors all sold.

<p>Market Sentiment is Loose</p>
<p>Yesterday, British and American silver markets continued to shrink, but the European market was sluggish. Yokohama and Kobe had no good signs. As for the foreign exchange rates quoted by HSBC, they were the same as the revised rates of the previous day. However, the internal prices of banks rose and fell slightly. From a flat morning, it continued to weaken, and then it showed strength. At noon, it was flat, and it stabilized in the afternoon. The gold market rose and fell, with a fluctuation of 2.67 Taels. There were more sellers. In the end, it fell by 1.5 Taels. As a result, the exchange rate was affected. The US dollar and the Japanese gold both lengthened in the forenoon, decreasing by .0125, respectively. Chinese merchant speculators are constantly purchasing and selling, but the first has already passed, so the banks have already resumed full-day business. It is estimated that the number of British gold has dropped tens of thousands of pounds, which is being sold by Shanghai. It's being sold by those in the Gold Industry at a rate of 5-6 10,000 pounds, Tonghui, Mitsui, and Sumitomo accepting. The US Dollar is being sold for over 100,000 dollars. Sumitomo and Zhengjin are buying. The banks do several 10,000 Yuan deals with each other. The Chinese merchants on the Japanese gold both before and after the day approximately sold for 1 Million + Yuan. The banks' appetites aren't weak. Shanghai, Sumitomo, Central, Chosen, and Mitsui are all buying. Guangdong Shengda and others took in tens of 10,000 Yuan, From Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Industrial and Commercial, and Datong sales. The Dalian gang also slightly dumped, thus covering gold standards. However, it seems the human heart is transitioning to a softer trend. The state of the market reveals the frustration.</p>
<p>British Exchange internal prices are calculated to increase or decrease one two five. At ten in the morning, May had a price of ten shillings eight one two five, June eight seven five, July nine three seven five, August eleven shillings. The purchase price has 0625 added to it.

<h3 id="e174">Yarn, Cotton, and Silk Markets Are Increasingly Weak <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains flat and weak, with no distinction between gains and losses. This stalemate seems to have the potential to last for a long time. Therefore, transactions are sluggish, and both bulls and bears maintain firm stances. However, most retail investors are bearish because the peak season for temporary workers is approaching. The situation is unstable, and overseas cotton yarn market conditions are also softening. Although manufacturers are holding on tightly, some are watching for imported yarns costing 50 taels. According to customs reports, cotton yarn exports last month were relatively brisk, totaling over 80,000 bales. The yarn market is currently being hit by the war, making it difficult to achieve significant development.</p>
<p>There are many short-selling positions in forward contracts. At the opening of the morning session, U.S. cotton prices showed mixed gains and losses, and market sentiment was flat and weak with no significant fluctuations. Transactions were increasingly scarce. There were many short positions in distant months. Prices in near months fell by one or two qian. In the afternoon, retail investors sold off slightly, leading to further weakness and a drop of two or three qian. The total daily transaction volume was only 2,800 bales. The closing prices from the public auctions are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>The Sichuan guild also imported over a thousand bales of spot yarn, which sold well. According to statistics, various guilds bought a total of 1,405 bales throughout the day. Among them, the same industry imported 1,250 bales, and the market prices were similar to the previous day. Most of the purchases from other provinces were from Sichuan, totaling 1,065 bales. Furthermore, 200 bales were imported from Guangdong, 30 bales from Xiamen, 30 bales from inland areas, and 70 bales from miscellaneous sources.</p>

<p>The cotton market is flat. Overseas telegrams showed mixed gains and losses. The Indian market was closed due to political unrest. There were many rumors about the near-month contracts of Hankou cotton. Japanese merchants were making deliveries, but this month's prices were already lower than the spot prices. However, the intention of the Hankou guild to go long remained unchanged. However, spot sales were too sluggish, and there might be changes in this situation.</p>
<p>Near-term cotton (5 taels imported) - At the opening of the morning session of Hankou cotton, sentiment was flat and weak due to mixed gains and losses in overseas cotton markets. Transactions were still scarce. Near-month contracts fell by 0.05 yuan, while distant-month contracts remained flat. In the afternoon, the current month contracts loosened by 0.015 yuan, and the distant month contracts followed suit with a drop of 0.05 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 11,200 dan. The closing prices of Hankou cotton are listed below.</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Fluctuates Between Declines in Old Crop and Increases in New Crop Prices - Yesterday, U.S. cotton prices fluctuated due to the possibility of large-scale deliveries. Later, prices strengthened due to good news from Liverpool and short covering. The price of old crop cotton fell by 13 points, while the price of new crop cotton rose by 1 to 8 points. The spot price fell by 10 points. British cotton futures rose by 4-5 points, while the spot price fell by 2 points. The spot price of Egyptian cotton rose by 35 points.

<p>Also, the spot yarn prices in Osaka are: 20-count Blue Fish: 157 yuan, unchanged, equivalent to 168 taels and 6 qian according to Shanghai regulations; 20-count Red Fortune God: 148 yuan, unchanged, equivalent to 158 taels and 9 qian according to Shanghai regulations; 16-count Fukushima: 146 yuan, unchanged, equivalent to 156 taels and 8 qian according to Shanghai regulations; 16-count Three Horses: 144 yuan, up 1 yuan, equivalent to 154 taels and 6 qian according to Shanghai regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Silk and Tea Sales Are Increasingly Sluggish <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market remained lifeless. It was found that for the first day of the European firms' spring competition, the telegram from the new cocoon factory to the European and American markets showed the middle-grade price was only 960 taels. The telegram was still not relayed yesterday. The sluggishness of European sales has reached its extreme. The business of factory silk merchants is increasingly in a dire situation. Yesterday, only Yufu imported 20 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Dachang imported 10 bales of Baiqian silk. The prices were both flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Grain and Rice Prices are High and Flat, with Secondary Declining <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Secondary-Grade Cargo Ships Return to Western Roads for Sale</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of cargo entering the Zhabei district via Guo Lu was not strong. Sales on this street remained slow. River stocks have not decreased. Therefore, the cargo ships carrying secondary-grade goods have been waiting for a long time. If there are no more customers, it is feared that there will be losses. As a result, more than a dozen ships have returned to sell their goods on the western roads. The price of this returned cargo is about 17.5 yuan. Therefore, the wholesale price of white japonica rice has gradually stabilized, but transactions remain scarce. The source of thin indica rice is seen to be scarce, and sales are slow. The price lacks fluctuations. The price of Yangjian rice remains sluggish. The demand for Dujian rice at various stalls is extremely flat, and prices are barely holding up. The Tongbian customer base selects high-quality goods and makes cautious purchases. The supply of Yinyuan goods is scarce, and prices have not risen or fallen.</p>
<p>About ten cargo ships arrived at the South Shanghai river wharves, but sales were not very brisk. Changshu-Wuxi top-grade japonica rice was flat, while ordinary rice saw a slight drop in wholesale prices. Stores were not greedy for Su-Tong machine-milled japonica rice and only had sporadic transactions. Market prices were similar to the previous day. The price of thin early indica rice from Southern provinces remained firm as there were no eager buyers from Ningbo, and the supply was scarce. Therefore, there were no price reductions. The demand for Yang-Du pointed rice remained quiet because cargo owners were in no rush to sell, and there were no profits or losses. Sales of White Yuan rice were average, and buyers were hesitant to pay high prices for Diaopi (coarsely milled rice). The market was weak.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Near-Term Flour Prices Expected to Exceed 5 Qian <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was stable. In the morning, there was still some activity from Tianjin brokers, but in the afternoon, they became more cautious. Therefore, the situation was slightly eased. However, the stocks of spot goods at Fuxin were extremely thin due to direct shipments to Tianjin and procurement for Tianjin brokers. Therefore, even small transactions on this street could not be purchased and shipped immediately. Therefore, the attitude of the factory was to still see prices above 5 qian in the current month. They seem unwilling to relax if the price does not reach this level. As for the distant months, market sentiment turned flat as the quoted price of imported wheat slightly returned by 0.457 jiao. However, if the current month's prices are raised again, the June contract must be brought up. Although new wheat may be seen in June, it is said that factory sales and purchases can only be made in mid-June. Therefore, there may still be problems ahead. As a result, the current month was 0.005 yuan higher than the previous day. The June to September contracts remained unchanged, and the October contract was 0.0025 yuan higher.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Wheat Futures Hovering with a Tightening Trend <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Spot Prices Also Call for 0.05 or 0.06 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 11,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a stable trend. Although the quoted price of imported wheat repeatedly fell back, domestic wheat farmers still thought of holding firm before the new wheat was harvested. The new short sellers in the producing areas had to be wary of the influence of the Suzhou broker group. Therefore, the market hovered with a tightening trend throughout the day, and the inability to maintain prolonged sunny weather seemed to be a guarantee for the bulls to hold on to their positions. As a result, the June and July contracts were 0.01 yuan higher than the previous day, the August and September contracts remained unchanged, and the October contract was slightly down by 0.01 yuan in the morning but did not trade in the afternoon. After the surge in spot wheat prices this month, the quoted prices in various producing areas also rose, and factories actively bought even several points higher due to the active flour sales. Yesterday, the asking price for high-quality wheat was 0.05 or 0.06 yuan higher than the previous day. Prices offered were: Bengbu wheat 0.5 taels, Qingjiangpu wheat, Nansuizhou wheat 0.5 taels, Hankou wheat 0.433 yuan, and Shashi wheat 0.425 to 0.435 yuan, totaling 11,300 bags, purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Piece Goods and Imported Yarn Buck the Trend with Solely Increasing Prices <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods transactions are increasingly lifeless. There is only sporadic activity in the market. This is because few inland merchants come to Shanghai due to the busy farming season. There are no signs of improvement in customer routes such as Hankou and Jiangxi. Except for some orders placed, there are few inquiries about spot goods from Sichuan merchants. The prices of goods have repeatedly softened. Dong goods, such as white crepe, are down 0.025 yuan, Rengou jiaoye opened at 0.3 taels, blue striped satin fell 0.0025 yuan, Shuangxingfu opened at 0.01575 yuan, Sixiangshi opened at 0.01625 yuan, and printed cloth has fallen miserably, generally selling for 0.39 taels. Due to the small amount of imported yarn arriving and the peak sales season, imported yarn is still quite firm. The current price of Li Bai is 1.075 taels, Xiaomeiren is 0.93 taels, and Dian Qiuxiang is 0.8425 taels. Transactions in the street amounted to thirty or forty pieces. Since the arrival of printed crepe cloth, prices have gradually fallen. Yue Ertong opened at 0.25 taels, and Meilanfang opened at 0.245 taels, but it is still difficult to boost sales. The trend of Western goods is chaotic. Those who are eager to sell are experiencing significant price drops. Therefore, items such as Chong gauze skirts are all falling in price. Plain pongee silk is still selling well. Maolong Sixiangshi opened at 0.0475 yuan, and Deji Jingongzi opened at 0.0615 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Thick Biequ fabric and French flannel have smooth sales trends <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Thick Biequ fabric is mostly used for Western suits, with strong sales in the summer. Fabrics with silk-like stripes and crepe-like gray-yellow colors are sought after by woolen fabric stores. Wholesale prices are around 0.3 taels per yard, while retail prices are 6-7 yuan. Slightly lower-grade fabrics sell for 0.22-0.23 taels. Those with a soft and glossy texture must be priced above 0.34-0.35 taels, which are known in the market as fashionable Balle fabrics. Lower-grade fabrics with stripes and solid colors from brands such as Tianyou, Hao Shi, Rongtai, Anli, and Hualun sell for only 0.18-0.19 taels per yard.</p>
<p>The sales season for French flannel is longer than that of thick Biequ fabric, with the strongest sales in the spring and autumn seasons. Colors are divided into yellow, white, gray, blue, striped, plaid, solid colors, etc. The most popular colors in the market recently are blue and white-gray. Prices range from 0.2 taels to 0.34-0.35 taels per yard. The lower-grade fabrics selling for around 0.2 taels last week have now sold out. There are also few stocks left of the 0.24-0.25 tael fabrics. Yesterday, those holding the goods raised prices, and stores had no choice but to increase their purchase prices accordingly. Therefore, brands such as Zhongzheng, Ningfeng, Hongsheng, Gongyi, and Gongping are generally unwilling to sell at low prices.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Hardware English Steel Sheet Fixed Prices Drop Significantly <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>According to telegrams received from various foreign firms yesterday, the price of English steel sheets per ton has fallen by more than half a pound compared to before. It is speculated that the reason is the recent weakening of foreign exchange rates. Since the weakening of the shilling, various businesses have been hesitant to trade in the forward contracts for this product. Therefore, there has been little trading in the past few months, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in this area. The standard quality remains popular and long-lasting. Currently, prices are: 0.025 inch - 0.925 taels, 0.5 inch - 0.625 taels, 0.75 inch - 0.645 taels, 1 inch - 0.6 taels. Transactions are also quite substantial. The telegrams from overseas are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Thickness | Current Price | Previous Price |</p>
<p>|-----------|---------------|----------------|</p>
<p>| 0.025 inch | £17 1s        | £11 7s 6d      |</p>
<p>| 0.5 inch  | £8           | £8 10s        |</p>

<h3 id="e184">Oil Market Tung Oil Prices Loosen and Fall <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The peak sales season for refined tung oil is in the autumn. Sales are not weak in the spring and summer seasons, but they are not as strong as in the new autumn. At the beginning of this year's spring, the price of top-grade refined tung oil was still above 0.3 taels. Later, due to the loosening of the prices of Hong oil and Bai oil, tung oil was inevitably affected, so it fell to 0.3 taels. However, the various oil presses in the producing areas carefully studied the oil color, and the cost was high. They were unwilling to follow the price drop of Hong oil and Bai oil, so the new cargo remained very firm. They were willing to keep it for a long time. Currently, it is between the spring and summer sales seasons, just in a sluggish period. Therefore, the local oil and hemp shops temporarily reduced prices in order to stimulate buyers' interest, waiting for the summer sales to slightly increase before raising prices again. Therefore, the top-grade Wanxing, Yu Da Youheng, and other brands were all dropped by 0.1 tael, and others by several qian. However, this is not due to weakness in the market, so it is expected that prices will increase again soon.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Wireless Transmission of Newspapers Successfully Achieved for the First Time <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The San Francisco Call-Bulletin, published in San Francisco, transmitted its full front page via wireless to Schenectady, New York, in late March on the 21st. This marks the beginning of the wireless transmission of original newspaper text. San Francisco and Schenectady are 2,500 miles apart, and the transmission was completely successful. It is anticipated that the front pages of the London Times or the New York Times will soon be transmitted to Nanjing or Shanghai. According to the American magazine "Editor &amp; Publisher," regarding the Call-Bulletin's transmission, three hours after the newspaper was published on March 21st, people in the research laboratory of the General Electric Company in Schenectady were able to read the full page of its front page. The page was transmitted via wireless, traveling 2,500 miles through space. In the laboratory, it was completely copied to its original size by a new automatic copying machine. Wireless technicians claim this is the first successful attempt of this kind. It is predicted that eventually, wireless will be able to transmit most commercial mail and deliver daily newspapers to readers' homes daily. Furthermore, according to a statement issued by the General Electric Company, several years ago, the company's chairman, Owen Young (the author of the Young Plan), gave a speech at a banquet honoring the new president of the Radio Corporation of America, Harbord, stating that he hoped to one day see the front page of the London Times transmitted electronically in New York City. This transmission has somewhat fulfilled Young's prediction. The new machine for copying the newspaper page was developed by Charles Young, Owen Young's son. The machine is the size of an ordinary small suitcase and can be connected to any wireless receiver, like a speaker. The text it receives is printed on a roll of paper, which moves through the machine at a rate of about one and a half inches per minute. In this test, for convenience, a shortwave receiver was used, and the paper was 8 inches wide. The full front page of the Call-Bulletin was printed on three sheets of paper. However, technicians say that the width of the paper is probably not limited to 8 inches because the machine is still under development. The transmitter in San Francisco was built by Dr. Alexanderson in the research laboratory of the General Electric Company and installed at the company's shortwave radio station in Oakland, California, broadcasting using a 17.3-meter wavelength. Dr. Alexanderson, Young, and the technicians are unwilling to discuss the details of the transmission and the copying machine, only saying that the results are interesting, but much development is still needed to complete it.</p>

<p>Chapter 38: French Prose of the 19th Century</p>
<p>Seeing and singing of good and evil,</p>
<p>He now controls the singing keys of all.</p>
<p>– Swinburne, "Victor Hugo"</p>
<p>As I tried to say while narrating the English lyric poets of the seventeenth century, the schools or types of poetry are so intertwined that they confuse those who try to draw definite lines. We cannot say where school A ends and school B begins. Nineteenth-century (and the years before and after) French poetry is indistinctly divided into these three groups: Romantic, Parnassian, and Symbolist. In both English and French Romanticism (the movements in both countries are inexplicably similar and yet different), in both form and content, broke free from the shackles of tradition, sought material in the past, in the depths of their own souls, and in the stars, loosening Pegasus's reins. The Parnassians, on the other hand, resisted the indulgence of the Romantics, their personal laments, and Byronian egoism, striving to make poetry objective, impersonal, "inhuman," not as cold as marble, but as pure, solid, and clear as a beautiful statue. This was a new classicism that even considered Shakespeare and Dante "vulgar." Next came the Symbolists, who advocated the necessity of personal things, the singing of oneself, and claimed that doing anything else honestly was impossible. Their critical spokesperson, Edmond de Goncourt, said that the only justification for writing is to express one's own personality. These three schools and several subordinate factions (it is said that France has a new school of poetry every fifteen years) are not fundamentally hostile or conflicting, because after all, poetry is always poetry. Leconte de Lisle, the greatest figure of the Parnassians, was just as personal in his own way as Verlaine was in his. The Parnassians spoke of and practiced the beauty of form and the beauty of sound. Verlaine's greatest slogan was, "Music above all else." The Symbolists, who expressed their moods and sentiments, conveying their emotions and feelings to the reader through suggestion, certainly had little to argue with the early Romantics. For example, didn't Lamartine do the same in "The Lake" and "In Solitude"? If it is said that the Parnassians have some similarities with the realists in novels, then where is the line between Romanticism and Realism? This old question arises again. However, as for modern poets, we will not fully understand them if we try to determine which chair they sit on in the school.</p>
<p>The French Romantic movement in poetry, to the extent that a definite beginning can be pointed out, began with André Chénier, the amazing young poet who died on the scaffold at the age of thirty-two. He drew his inspiration from Greek and Latin. Although the Romantics called him a precursor, he was truly a thorough classicist. However, his classicism was not pedantic. It was not something borrowed or consciously studied, but a part of his nature, a true classicism. His poetry was soft and beautiful, so the Romantics called him father. Some of his poems, if included in a Greek anthology, would be quite appropriate.</p>
<p>The great ballad poet and popular songwriter Béranger, although his vigorous songs were certainly not incompatible with his admiring Romantic contemporaries, did not belong to the Romantic group but was entirely isolated. His songs or ballads were dazzling, colorful, and skillfully varied. The vocabulary was simple and honest, and the rhythm, even if not subtle, was singable. In that category, though not the greatest, it was complete. There was no ballad like the one pointing at Napoleon that was so full of soaring spirit.</p>
<p>Once there was a king of Yvetot,</p>
<p>The first great poet in the Romantic group was Lamartine. His "Meditations," which were never surpassed by his later works, is one of the defining books in French literature. Such melody had not been heard in France since the seventeenth century. It was something spontaneous, fresh, and pure, a sorrow, a gentle sorrow bordering on sentimentality. The mood of "Twilight and Memory" was completely honest. The scope of his emotions was limited, and his delicate colors almost faded to invisibility before the magnificent brilliance of Hugo and his school. However, later poets and critics looked at him with increasing admiration. There is no doubt about this. His most famous poem is "The Lake," from which I will quote two verses translated by Shelley:</p>
