<h3 id="c12">第一次世界航空安全大會 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>今日世界社載巴黎訊。法航空部宣布。自十二月十日至二十三日。開第一次世界航空安全大會。有四十國政府代表及專家發明家列席。凡各種飛行器如高空飛機水面飛機氣球飛船。皆在考慮之列。法政府希望大會結果。能使航空安全之保證。提早十年實現。而目前所最主要者。爲安全下落傘。大會任務在創設一永久團體。以研究各方面之安全及恊力合作方法。此項機關。將設於巴黎。已有二十三國之元首。允許爲發起人云云。是舉也誠今日航空界最需要之事矣。</p>
<p>自來機器事業之進步。第一在發明。第二即在求安全之道。以交通界言。如輪船電車等。在從前甫經發明試行之時。以設備未周訓練未熟經騐未深之故。不能無危險之事。起於倉卒。其時人民信仰未深。又見發生危險。遂致有動色相戒者。幸當局於發明而後。即繼以研求種種安全方法。盡力以彌補其缺陷。使無意外之危險發生。國人懷疑之心。遂亦日漸氷釋。此所以未成進步上之阻力也。飛行器之發明。雖亦已久。然至近年而始極盛行。一切保護安全之方法。尙未能進於周備。故飛機失愼之事。時有所聞。日前英飛船之失事。爲世界一大慘劇。今我滬漢航空公司飛機之失事。事亦甚慘。是可知研究所以安全之道。實爲今日航空界萬不容緩之舉。而法國航空部適於此時。召開第一次世界航空安全大會。合世界各國之專家發明家。同心協力以考求保障安全之各方法。其有裨益於將來之航空界。必甚鉅大。則斯會之設。詎非世界航空之福音歟。</p>

<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>吾國新敎育開始後二。年即前清光緒三十年。民立中學嶄然露頭角於黄歇浦畔。創辦人即今日吾人歌功頌德之蘇筠尙氏。當時負笈來學者。不滿七十。規模簡陋。較諸今日學生達一五四八。敎員八十六。校友數萬。異業生遍大江南北。校舍偉大超出大學。相去何可以道里計。縱曰現任校長蘇穎傑氏慘淡經營有以致之。然飲水思源要皆筠尙氏樹其基礎之功也。該校於月之六日上午十時半。行筠尙氏紀念碑揭幕禮。記者心儀其人。乃隨氏家族出席。爰記其盛况如下。</p>
<p>紀念碑　紀念碑植在該校第二運動塲。位今歲所築之新舍前。碑形長方。四週鐫有中英紀念文。其頂正面嵌氏半身鋼像。出自美術家張眉蓀手筆。令人望而敬羨。頂後端。繪刻鋼質圖案。係氏第六公子祖齊作品。寓意重商重學。并期發揚光大於來茲。意至美喜。聞日後將添設欄圍以壯觀瞻。是日。各界贈送禮物甚夥花圈纍纍。環繞碑之前後。一種嚴肅景象。可與俾斯麥克手執鮮花祭威廉老皇時古今對照也。</p>
<p>紀念詞　市敎育局長徐君陶清晨即蒞臨。到會逾一時他去。馬湘伯駕臨最遲。高壽九十一。精神甚　鑠。當其演說時。全塲寂然墮針可聞。馬謂人民如羊。政府若執鞭牧人。羣羊唯牧人之命是聽。好惡僉由他人。全無自由世間不平等莫過於此。惟國者集民而成體者也國能保其平等與獨立之威嚴。必其國民先富於平等獨立之性。筠尙氏能蜷伏於專制政體下。創設學校培植人民平等獨立。其功固大其志堪佩也末勗該校同學。須以筠尙之精神爲精神。以筠尙之道德爲道德。旋校友會代表周瘦鵑學生會代表胡績勛致詞。語短意長。彌復動聽。</p>
<p>紀念文　碑記由吳江孫延庚譔。其文曰。先生旣殁之十年。民立敎職會諸子思念先生之功德不衰。相與咨嗟曰。大江以南黄浦之上。以工商人而興學者。北曰澄衷。東曰浦東。南曰民立。彼葉氏楊氏皆有吉金貞石以表章。而先生獨付缺如。無以崇德報功。詔茲來許以走告於同學會及學生會諸子。僉曰。其植碑宜。而以文屬之余余斐然曰。余固先生故人也。知蘇氏爲最詳。其何能以不文辭。蘇氏有兄弟四人。長曰本立。次曰本炎。三曰本銚。季曰本浩。本炎即先生。本銚即今校長穎傑先生也思以學術救國斥財以建斯校。於前清光緒三十年。敎務即穎傑先生主之。而校務則總之先生。夫蘇氏家財。固不得與葉氏楊氏比。則其締造之艱難可念也蓋先生之爲人也豪邁義所當爲。雖萬金不之惜。故資財不過中人。而前後十五年間。校中度支有賴先生挹注者。强半其數也。載於姚氏所爲墓志中。然先生之職曰總理即今經理之謂。一校之事。無所不當問。非區區財政已也。而先生故爲商界祭酒聲名滿天下。出其餘力以治校。自有高掌遠蹠之勢。故凡撥地。奠基。藝舍。移校。購田。擴充。請欵。補助諸大端。勞心焦思雖爲穎傑先生。而推行得以無阻者。全賴先生之力。自先生殁後。而校務亦叢集於穎傑先生之身而始覺賢勞矣。彼葉氏楊氏之賢在於能出鉅金以奉邑人而已可一切不之與。以視先生。其勞逸爲何如耶。宜乎殁久而人猶思之謀所以垂不朽。因集銀九百餘圓而樹一碑。於東西校舍之間。計敎職會出十之五同學會出十之二。學生會出十之三。於例宜書。嗚呼。先生之殁已十年矣。余時躑躅於校間。覺一瓦一椽一草一木。皆若有先生之精神在。何耶所願敎職會諸子。以先生之心爲心勤天之職。樹民之坊。同學會及學生會諸子。出用建樹。楊先生光。處無怠荒貽先生。恫行於道上。路人亦驚其特異。如宋人之於胡安氏。曰。此蘇氏之門生也。則先生之精神。常灌注於人人之心腹腎腸。不更逾於植碑以媲美葉楊耶是在余與諸子共勉之耳。</p>

<p>一些電影明星的社交生活或是愛情生活家庭生活的記載常給許多報紙雜誌以極大的注意。尤其在美國。便是一個女明星遺失一支衣襟上的花。也成爲許多關於電影的報紙雜誌所屬目的好資料。最近在我國電影界中發現了一件胡蝶女士與林雪懷君解除婚約案自然很爲社會所注意。因此。。予昨日親訪胡女士于明星公司與女士作下列之談話</p>
<p>胡女士謂「過去的電影界的浪漫空氣我是素來反對的。頻年以來本人從事于電影事業自幸能夠保持得良好的信譽。也因此僥倖博得許多社會人士的誠摯的的同情。現在這一件事。誠然出于意料之外。外界雖然對于我有所猜疑。但我一顆純潔的心。將來仍舊會得透露個明明白白。現在對于此事。我也不願多說廢話。我此後的生活便是格外努力于電影事業。我常常相信。事業的成功乃是一切信用名譽的最好的保障。」說到這裏。胡女士就默然無言者久之繼乃言曰「先生請你去看看我主演的那個歌女紅牡丹」新片子吧。做女子的總得吃些虧。」胡女士忽然笑起來了。</p>
<p>繼遇該公司導演鄭止秋君鄭君謂。「胡女士對于電影。案極努力此次的事。實是伊的不幸。伊在明星。攝片已經很多最出奇要算是「碎琴樓」一片。現在正從事攝製「啼笑姻緣。成績益見美滿。至于「歌女紅牡丹」也是伊主演的一張有聲影片。將來出演後。我相信一定有很好的結果的這幾天來伊也並不爲發生了這不幸的事而消極。據伊自已說。一個人生總難免有意外的事。所以仍舊天天到公司拍影片。一點也不懈怠。我想。以胡女士的現在的地位上伊肯努力的話將來一定很有希望的呢。」</p>

<p>王岩濤曰。吾來缅亦染其風。覓人生觀　天自在爲上策。視財甚輕但缅人昔不交通。純是缅人則可。大家均　天。好施可以互助。今英人印度人華人日本人凡來缅者均以種種智術攫富源以去。而來者皆不肯布施。故致缅人窮困矣。余聞蒙古人亦然。視財産頗輕。蓋經佛化然也。不解中土富者亦頗知佛。而吝嗇特甚。何哉。萬慧師甚贊缅人敎化道德之高。而視華人之鄙吝貪殤。爭攫權利。爲兒孫作馬牛。其去缅人俠義清高之風遠矣。余曰。惜哉胡不以佛化運動歐人乎友人張相文地理家也。曾謂余曰。試觀蒙古人之雄。乂推倒一世。即自一受佛化後。馴良至今。欲歐人馴良。非大播佛化不可。余殊不解中土學佛者毫無一點報恩弘法之事功能傳播四遠。而只求福求壽下等福報也。哀哉。缅甸風俗有一俗。於雨季將到之前。約陽三四月之交。有潑水之俗。男與男女與女。男女間皆互相潑水。潑水禮行後。可自由戀愛。未結婚者可自由成婚。已婚者可自由換婚。但潑者乃香水清水。而不可用惡水。父母不能干涉。師父無權干涉此節之長。約一禮拜。最大潑者有三天。但雖非潑水節。而男女離婚。平時亦自由。不過其一年之大變動。則在潑水節耳。按此與周禮仲春二月司徒媒氏官掌會合男女之無夫家者而會之。奔者不禁同俗也。陽四月正當我二月矣。但我閱報似安南（記不確）亦有此俗。因潑水而閙大風潮。是節滿街大潑水。逢人即潑。至擾亂秩序。有受傷者云。蓋潑水之意。乃因雨季將至。是炎熱之候。大家必須冲凉之意。相敎戒沿而爲敬愛之俗也。</p>

<p>第十六回　殷勤問字翠袖謁先生　慷慨談兵青樓宴女傑</p>
<p>綠漪的房間。是占了一個三幢頭房子四分之一。在樓上東面一個廂房。又後面一個大亭子間。他門的布置。似乎稍爲改變一點。通常的様子。把廂房樓改成個書房的模様。後面那間大亭子間。作爲臥房。其實所謂書房模様者。適成其爲妓院裏的書房。名爲書房。一本書也没有。不必說了。他們的器具。都是從傢生店廟租來的。上海有許多木器店。都是靠妓院爲生活的。譬如全房間紅木器具。每節租多少錢。就有一張床。幾張桌子。幾張椅子等等。成爲一組。這一組便稱爲一房間。到了每一節調頭汎裏。便從這一條弄堂裏。搬到那一條弄堂裏。或從那一間房間裏。移到那一間房間裏。要是那種木器。變成了有知識的傢伙。就牠的冷眼看人。閱歷倒也不少。倘然它能開起口來。也可以訴盡人間的痴愚了。所謂妓院中書房的擺設。也是木器店那們一套頭。正中安置一張紅木的坑床。雖然也有一個坑几。那移開了坑几。便供給一般客人。爲吸鴉片烟之需。此外便是一張紅木的八仙桌。沿璧一排靠椅茶几。也有一張有抽屜的書桌。不過那書桌抽屜拽開來一看。裹面安放的是什麽東西。却是他們大小月底所燒的紙錠元賓。一疊疊的摺好在那裏。還有粗做娘姨所紮的鞋底。連着剪刀針篐。再翻下去。便是空香烟罐頭。和斷了絲的電燈泡了。錄漪新舖了的房間。自然有點新氣象。雖然房間裏的器具。全是租來的。但伊是要揀選最上好的。那時候。外國式的器具。還不甚流行於北里。他們以爲西式的木器用不起。那種彈簧的沙發椅子。新的時候還好。不到一節工夫。坐的地方就是一個潭。早已失去安的彈力性了。有種身體瘦的朋友。他的骨頭。早已撑出在皮膚以外。再坐了那種彈簧圈也撑出在外面的椅子。兩種露骨的東西碰了頭。顯見其不舒服了。倒不如中國固有的那種楊妃榻之類。别有風趣。還有外國桌子的抽屜倒也很多。只是裹面的板。常是脫落。第一隻抽屜裏安放了東西。安會在最末一隻抽屜裏發現。尤其是外國器具上的油漆。嬌嫩得像美人的肌膚。什麽熱東西。安放上去。便留一個痕跡。須得用花露水。常常的給它抹拭。要人家用服侍小姐的工夫。來服侍外國木器。有點不情願了</p>

<h3 id="e12">First World Aviation Safety Conference <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The World Today Daily News reports from Paris: The French Air Ministry announced that the First World Aviation Safety Conference will be held from December 10th to 23rd. Representatives from the governments of 40 countries, as well as experts and inventors, will attend. All types of aircraft, such as high-altitude planes, seaplanes, balloons, and airships, are under consideration. The French government hopes that the conference results will enable the assurance of aviation safety to be realized ten years earlier. The most important thing at present is the safety of parachutes. The task of the conference is to create a permanent organization to study all aspects of safety and methods of cooperation. This organization will be located in Paris. The heads of state of 23 countries have agreed to be the initiators, and so on. This move is indeed the most needed thing in today's aviation industry.</p>
<p>Since the progress of mechanical industries, the first is in invention, and the second is in seeking safety. Taking the transportation industry as an example, such as ships and trams, when they were first invented and put into trial operation in the past, there could not be dangerous events due to incomplete equipment, unskilled training, and lack of experience. It started suddenly. At that time, people's faith was not deep, and seeing the occurrence of danger, they were alarmed. Fortunately, after the invention, the authorities continued to study various safety methods and made every effort to make up for the defects, so that no unexpected dangers occurred. The doubts in the hearts of the people have also gradually dissipated. This is why it has not become an obstacle to progress. Although the invention of aircraft has been around for a long time, it has only become extremely popular in recent years. All methods of protecting safety have not yet progressed to completeness. Therefore, incidents of aircraft accidents are often heard. The accident of the British airship the other day was a major tragedy in the world. The plane crash of our Shanghai-Hankou Airlines the other day was also very tragic. It can be seen that studying the way to safety is an urgent matter for today's aviation industry. The French Air Ministry convened the First World Aviation Safety Conference at this time, and experts and inventors from all over the world worked together to study various methods to ensure safety. It will be of great benefit to the aviation industry in the future. Isn't the establishment of this conference the gospel of world aviation?</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) In recent days, there has been a slight run on the Hong Kong branch of the American bank, Banque de l'Indochine. The bank's branch in Guangzhou also experienced a run on Thursday. The run has now subsided. On Monday and Tuesday, Chinese people in Hong Kong rushed to withdraw their deposits from the bank. Today, the number of people has decreased, and some Chinese people have even come from remote counties to withdraw their deposits. This morning, the bank's manager told guests that the bank has extremely rich liquid assets and can easily cope with any run. This run was caused by merchants speculating on Haoyang silver dollars in Guangzhou fabricating rumors in order to lower the price of Haoyang silver dollars. The American consul here published a notice in the newspapers this morning, stating that the New York branch of the Banque de l'Indochine is one of the largest banks in the United States. The rumors circulating outside that the bank has closed and that the president has committed suicide are all unfounded. The bank is currently operating as usual. This announcement is made by order of the US government in Washington for public knowledge. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e53">Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference Holds its Final Meeting <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Decides to Submit the Draft Disarmament Convention</p>
<p>To the League of Nations Executive Council</p>
<p>Recommends Convening a General Assembly as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Soviet Representative's Declaration Attached to the Report</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 9th - The Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference held its final meeting this afternoon and submitted the draft Disarmament Convention, which is the culmination of four and a half years of work, to the League of Nations Executive Council. However, whether this draft convention can become international law in the future remains to be seen. The report submitted by the commission along with the convention only recommends convening the final Disarmament Conference as soon as possible, without specifying a date. It is expected that the League of Nations Executive Council will decide on a date between November 1932 and the spring of 1932. The exact date will be determined later on a temporary basis. It is expected that 50-60 countries will be represented, with no fewer than 3,000 experts. The meeting will last at least six months. At today's final meeting, the British representative praised the draft convention as a major step forward. The Greek representative echoed this sentiment. The Russian representative, however, denounced it as a deceitful act, saying that it only reduces the armaments of the defeated countries, while the victorious countries still refuse to disarm. He also requested that his declaration be included in the commission's report. The chairman, Mr. Loudon, strongly rejected his request. After some debate, a compromise proposal by the Spanish representative was passed, attaching the Soviet representative's declaration as an appendix to the report. The German representative also expressed doubts about the future of the draft, saying that Germany would reject it because many of Germany's proposals had been rejected. The Chinese representative also made a brief speech, expressing his agreement with the draft and solemnly declaring China's desire for peace.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 9th - The Russian representative today made a statement to the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference, questioning why the draft disarmament convention did not include Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland, and Romania, and asking about the reason for the reservation that whether or not they join the disarmament convention depends on whether or not Russia joins. After discussion, the conference decided not to mention Russia in the text, but to amend the original text to state that the five countries of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Poland, and Romania would base their accession to the draft disarmament convention on certain amendments. The Preparatory Commission decided to reserve the study of this issue for the next meeting. The Russian representative has expressed his agreement. The Disarmament and Armaments Commission concluded its five-week meeting today, after which a general assembly was convened. At the close of the meeting, Wu Kaisheng, the Chinese representative, said that China had a clear opinion on disarmament and peace, which would be presented at the general assembly. The fundamental and ideal causes of war must be eliminated. The Dutch representative, Mr. Louden, asked the representatives to urge their governments to convene the general assembly as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Opposition Parties Stage Angry Demonstrations</p>
<p>Using the Film "All Quiet on the Western Front" as Material for their Performance</p>
<p>Mobs Clash with Police Repeatedly</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 9th - The Brüning cabinet achieved another major victory in the parliament today. The opposition parties' motion requesting the government to facilitate a discussion of foreign policy was also rejected. The debate on this case was very intense. The most insightful speech on the government party side was given by Mr. Ulitzka, a member of the Central Clerical Party, who said that to abruptly discuss the Polish atrocities in the Polish-controlled territory of Upper Silesia at this time would not only restrict the actions of the German representatives in the next League of Nations Executive Council meeting, but would also increase the difficulties of the German minority in the area. Therefore, now is not the time to discuss it. Before the case was opened, there were also several motions from the opposition parties within the financial plan published under emergency orders, requesting the revocation of certain proposals. They were also rejected one by one because the Social Democratic Party supported the government. Although the parliament still needs to meet for a few more days before adjourning until the end of January, it will deal with routine matters and there will be no more motions to overthrow the cabinet. The government can focus on reform work, such as suppressing prices and reducing production costs, in order to enrich the people's lives and consolidate its position. However, the National Socialist Party, angered by its complete failure in the parliament, seems determined to use demonstrations and other methods to regain the faith of its members. In Berlin, they have found the film "All Quiet on the Western Front" to be a great topic for their demonstrations. Since last week, they have gathered crowds in front of the cinema every day to make trouble. Today, they even threatened to hold a large-scale demonstration, with all 107 members of the parliament participating. The officials in charge dispatched all the reserve police, and the western part of Berlin was under strict guard, like a large military camp. Traffic was diverted to other routes. It is expected that no incidents will occur.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 10th - Last night's demonstration against the film "All Quiet on the Western Front" led to a clash between the mob and the police. The police had no choice but to use rubber batons to disperse the crowd and fire warning shots. Two policemen were injured by stones. Dr. Fabritius, a National Socialist member of parliament, was arrested for obstructing the police. In addition, 13 other people were arrested.</p>

<p>Opposition Parties Prepare to Question Events</p>
<p>Government Parties Occupy the Majority of Seats</p>
<p>National Society, Warsaw, 9th - The new Polish parliament was convened today to establish the meeting. The new Prime Minister, Mr. Slawek, read out the President's instructions, repeatedly urging the passage of the Constitutional Amendment Act, saying that this is the most urgent task at present. When Mr. Slawek read out the instructions, the Communist Party members repeatedly interrupted him with noise, and were eventually escorted out of the venue by the parliamentary police. They shouted "Down with the baton-wielding government" as they left. As for the members of the left-wing opposition party group, they were refused entry to the venue during the new Prime Minister's speech, and only managed to attend during the roll call. Then, Mr. Switalski, a confidant of Piłsudski and former Prime Minister, was elected as Speaker and the meeting was adjourned. Currently, the left-wing opposition party group claims that it will question the detention of a large number of political prisoners at the Brest Fortress without trial. However, it is expected that this motion will be shelved by the government party and not be put on the agenda. Currently, the House of Representatives of the Polish Parliament has a total of 444 seats, of which the Piłsudski faction occupies 248 seats. In addition, the National Democratic Party has 62 seats, and the Social Democratic Party has 24 seats, which is slightly more. The remaining ten parties have only ten or a few seats each.</p>

<p>Drought and Unemployment -</p>
<p>The Old European War Responsibility Issue is Raised Again</p>
<p>National Society, Washington, 9th - The US Senate has passed various relief bills for drought and unemployment. One of the bills was proposed by Republican Senator Mr. McNary, advocating the appropriation of US$60,000,000 in national currency to be used for farmers in various places that suffered from prolonged drought last summer. In addition, a bill appropriating US$110,000,000 as unemployment relief funds was also passed. The Republican and Democratic parties in both houses were able to put aside their prejudices and cooperate with each other, which is why this good result was achieved.</p>
<p>National Society, Washington, 9th - When the Senate discussed the drought relief plan today, the old issue of European war responsibility was suddenly raised again. The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Senator Mr. Borah, said that the great disaster of the world from 1914 to 1918 should be borne by the British and French. Republican Senator Mr. Reed and Democratic Senator Mr. Deal opposed sympathizing with Germany. Mr. Borah strongly refuted the argument that the war debts owed by European countries to the United States should be cancelled during the debate. However, Democratic Senator Mr. Coburn claimed that several newspapers are now advocating the cancellation of war debts in order to alleviate the finances of the indebted countries, and that the United States can expand its market and promote its products because of this matter.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 9th - President Hoover only asked Congress to approve a commercial relief fund of $150 million, but in the past week, Congress has proposed various relief plans, with a total cost of $550 million. The anxiety of the general public about the current economic situation can be seen from this. President Hoover does not approve of such excessive spending of public funds, saying that misuse of the national treasury cannot restore prosperity. The expenditure set in the budget cannot be increased further. If it is increased, taxes must be raised, and the burden on farmers and workers will become heavier. Some people are manipulating politics by taking advantage of human annoyance, and Americans must not be deceived by them. The Senate has now passed a $60 million relief fund for farmers in disaster areas.</p>

Professor Nolf, the President of the Belgian Red Cross, earnestly stated that unfogged poison fog cannot kill people. This statement has attracted considerable attention, as the rumors that factory fumes killed people may not be unfounded. Belgian Prime Minister Mr. Spa also attended the investigation meeting. The Minister of the Interior was appointed Chairman of the Committee investigating this matter. Representatives of the committee who were sent to Engis to conduct an on-site investigation now say that when they arrived, the fog had cleared, making the investigation very difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Problem of the President of the Japanese Minseito Party <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Reaction to Interior Minister Adachi Acting as Proxy</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 10th - The government and the party believe that Prime Minister Hamaguchi can recover by the time the Diet convenes, so Interior Minister Adachi has been recommended to act as the president's proxy. But what if Prime Minister Hamaguchi's attending physician prevents the Prime Minister from attending the Diet? When Prime Minister Hiranuma took office, he stated that he was only acting as a proxy and would not be involved in policy issues. Within the Minseito party, many people are unwilling to have Prime Minister Hiranuma deal with the Diet. Therefore, if Foreign Minister Hiranuma acts as the Prime Minister's proxy and Interior Minister Adachi acts as the president's proxy, the two will inevitably clash. As a result, Interior Minister Adachi will have to replace Foreign Minister Hiranuma in dealing with the Diet, but he is still acting as Prime Minister, which some people claim is still morally unacceptable. The most legitimate solution at this time is for the Minseito party to elect a new president, resign once and for all, and then wait for the next cabinet to be appointed. However, the election of the president will involve the Adachi faction, the Eguchi faction, the Wakatsuki revival faction, and the Ugaki support faction, and there will inevitably be considerable turbulence before a decision is made. Even if the cabinet resigns en masse, it will not be due to policy failures, and the next appointment will inevitably be made to the Minseito party again. However, triggering such a political change at the end of the year will inevitably have a major impact on all aspects.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 10th - Regarding the issue of Interior Minister Adachi acting as the president's proxy, disunity has suddenly been exposed among party executives and cabinet members. Centering on the disbelief of Railway Minister Eguchi, disputes have arisen. That is, before yesterday's cabinet meeting, when Railway Minister Eguchi met with Secretary-General Tomita, Railway Minister Eguchi proposed that the recommendation of Interior Minister Adachi acting as the president's proxy should be discussed with the cabinet members who came from the party and then submitted to the cabinet meeting. Secretary-General Tomita replied that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's subsequent progress had been good, and the Diet staff would also make a formal decision. There was absolutely no obstacle to the liaison between the government and the party. If a liaison mechanism was set up at this time or a new president's proxy was established, it would feel like Prime Minister Hamaguchi's progress was poor, and this move would be to clean up internal party strife and give the opposition parties an opportunity to take advantage of it. Please consider carefully. Railway Minister Eguchi also understood and said that the cabinet members must fully consider it. After the opinions of the party executives are decided, please let me know immediately. Therefore, when Secretary-General Tomita attended the executive meeting, the executive meeting unanimously advocated moving forward with the current president-centered doctrine and was determined to restore Prime Minister Hamaguchi. The executive meeting was very angry at the cabinet members' decision to have Interior Minister Adachi act as the president's proxy, believing that it was a disregard for the party's opinions. The headquarters originally visited Railway Minister Eguchi in the afternoon to inquire about the decision to have Interior Minister Adachi. Last night at 9:00, Tomita and Hara visited Railway Minister Eguchi again to criticize his disbelief. As a result, a discussion meeting will be held today to discuss the aftermath. Although the party side is very dissatisfied with Railway Minister Eguchi's measures, since it is a problem decided by the cabinet members, the only thing to do is to consolidate the party's opinions. Therefore, at today's cabinet member executive discussion meeting, it will only be explained that the president's proxy is only for the convenience of recommending Interior Minister Adachi when dealing with the party and the government. No other words will be said to avoid disputes. Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, 10th - Regarding the fact that Interior Minister Adachi is in charge of the president's affairs, the air within the Minseito party is quite unstable. Railway Minister Eguchi summoned Director-General Okura at 9:00 this morning to explain the beginning and end of the recommendation of Interior Minister Adachi, hoping that he would strive to seek understanding. Mr. Okura promised and immediately began the understanding campaign. As a result, it was decided not to use the name of proxy president, but to use the name of liaison department and recommend Interior Minister Adachi. A cabinet member and party discussion meeting will be held at 5:00 PM today, and the outcome will be approved.</p>

<p>National Society, Paris, 9th - The new French cabinet may not be easy to form for a while. After being ordered, Mr. Lanfare continued to negotiate with the leaders of the various parties today and met with the President twice to report on the progress. However, whether he is confident remains to be seen until tomorrow morning. The general opinion is that Mr. Lane's hopes are very slim, because unless former Prime Minister Poincaré comes out of the mountains, the so-called centralized cabinet will be difficult to form, because the Radical Party and the Malland group are still at odds and unwilling to cooperate with each other. Therefore, Mr. Lane is currently planning to form a cabinet of talent regardless of party affiliation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Cairo, 9th - It is heard that the Egyptian government plans to temporarily close the cotton futures market due to the continued slump in cotton prices. A cotton industry expert expressed his views to people today, believing that cotton prices have almost fallen to the lowest possible level. As for the rumor that the Egyptian government wants to close the futures market, it is still doubtful, because the Liverpool cotton market is still open. Even if the Alexandria cotton market is closed, it may not be able to remedy the situation. The cotton sold in September for immediate extraction is now settled, and the demand for Sakellaridis cotton is only half of what it should be, while the demand for Ashmouni cotton can still be maintained. In summary, cotton prices have fallen. The government attaches great importance to the cotton market and has asked the Deputy Minister of Finance to go to Alexandria immediately to investigate everything and report on the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e70">After Chairman Chiang Arrived in Jiangxi <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Summoning Commanders of Various Divisions Back to the Province for Meetings</p>
<p>Refugees from Various Counties Petitioning En Masse</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang arrived in the province at 3:30 PM on the 7th. That evening and today (the 8th), he summoned He Chengjun, Zhu Shaoliang, and Lu Diping to the Executive Headquarters to discuss plans for joint suppression of Zhu and Peng's forces by Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Fujian provinces. It is said that Chiang is waiting to conduct another round of discussions with He Jian in Hunan and Hubei before implementing a general offensive by the four provinces to prevent the escape of the communist bandits. Furthermore, Chiang personally instructed Lu Diping last night to dispatch three aircraft capable of aerial reconnaissance to Yongfeng, Ji'an, and Fuzhou to bring Divisional Commanders Zhang Huizan, Gong Bingfan, Deng Ying, and others to the province to attend military conferences. However, after reporting to Chiang about his arrival in the province, Commander Zhang and his division had already departed from Ji'an aboard a warship en route to the province, and Commander Deng was also en route from Fuzhou on a fast boat. Both are expected to arrive by the 9th, so the dispatch of the aircraft was temporarily suspended. The remaining situations are as follows:</p>
<p>Party Committee, etc., Report Separately This morning (8th), Xiong Yuxi, member of the Provincial Party Committee and concurrently member of the Provincial Government, reported to Chiang at the Executive Headquarters on party affairs and politics in the province. Liu Jizhi, Director of Telecommunications Supervision, reported on telecommunications and the number of miles of power lines destroyed by communist bandits in various locations. Brigade Commander Liu Yi reported on the progress of suppressing the communists from Hubei into Jiangxi and the current defense situation. Zhou Zechun, Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs, reported on the recent diplomatic situation in the five provinces and requested instructions on all matters.</p>
<p>Visiting the Qingyunpu Scenic Spot At 11:30 AM today, Chiang, along with He Chengjun, Zhu Shaoliang, Lu Diping, Shao Lizi, Lu Xiaochen, and dozens of attendants and guards, traveled in over ten cars to visit Qingyunpu. Qingyunpu is a famous ancient temple in this city, featuring ancient relics such as five ancient osmanthus trees from the Tang Dynasty. The graves of soldiers who died in battle during the Northern Expedition in Jiangxi are built there. Chiang spent an hour touring Qingyunpu, enjoying refreshments, and then paid his respects at the martyrs' tombs, commemorating the fallen soldiers. He did not return to the province until 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Party Headquarters and Provincial Government This morning, Chiang originally intended to attend the Provincial Party Headquarters' Commemoration Week, and sentries had already been stationed along the route. However, the plan was suspended due to unforeseen circumstances. After returning from Qingyunpu, he immediately went to the Provincial Party Headquarters with Shao and Zhou for inspection, where they were received by Committee Members Liu and Lai. They first visited the auditorium and various departments, then rested in the conference room, inquiring about the state of party affairs in the province and the details of the bandit disaster in Ji'an. Committee Member Liu reported on everything and presented a booklet detailing the communist disaster in Jiangxi. Chiang then left the Provincial Party Headquarters for the Provincial Government. Upon arriving at the gate, representatives of petitioners from Yongxin County approached to petition, stating the disaster situation in Yongxin. Chiang said that he was fully aware of the situation and would take care of it accordingly. He then slowly walked to the Provincial Government, where all the members of the Provincial Government and all staff members welcomed him in the hall. Chiang then went to the chairman's office to rest, where Chairman Lu and various committee members reported on the political situation in the province and requested guidance. After talking for half an hour, Lu accompanied Chiang back to the Executive Headquarters, and the committee members bid farewell in a formal manner. At that time, Wang Yinxi, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, who had been handling relief work in Ji'an during this inspection tour, returned to the province from Ji'an after receiving Chiang's telegram and reported to Chiang at the Executive Headquarters on the tragic state of the bandit disaster along the Gan River, requesting instructions on relief measures. At the same time, the county magistrates of Nanchang and Xinjian Counties also paid their respects and reported on county affairs.</p>
<p>Requests from Various Levels of Party Headquarters Today, the entire Provincial and Municipal Party Committee members and members of various District Party Committees in the city went to the Executive Headquarters to petition one after another. As Chiang was out, they submitted their petitions and retreated. The general contents of the petition from the Municipal Party Committee were: (1) Thoroughly eradicate the communist bandits; (2) The central government bears the cost of suppressing the bandits; (3) Allocate significant funds for disaster relief; (4) The province's finances should be made public; (5) Strictly punish corruption; (6) Provide relief to unemployed party members; (7) Supervise and direct the Provincial Government to properly plan for post-disaster recovery; (8) Maintain educational funding; (9) Complete highways; (10) Eliminate exorbitant taxes.</p>
<p>Requests for Relief from Refugees in Various Counties Yuan Yuan, Chairman of the Association of Fellow Villagers in Jiangxi from Various Counties; Lu Shunshou, representative from Wanzai; Wang Naibin, representative from Jingdezhen; Yang Weiyi, representative from Shangrao; Yang Xuebin, representative from the Xihe Mining Area in Southern Jiangxi; Wang Mingxin, representative from Tonggu; Huang Shaoxiang, representative from Xiushui; Liu Zongquan, representative from Yichun, and others went to the Executive Headquarters one after another today to request troops to suppress the bandits and funds for disaster relief. Chiang sent representatives to receive them.</p>
<p>Requests from the Business Community for Tax and Rent Reductions Salt merchant Chen Xitao, the Provincial Federation of Commerce, the Nanchang General Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of the Nanchang Federation of Commerce, Xu Ruifu and over twenty others, petitioned Chiang one after another to exempt shop rents for three months and to stop the additional tax of one yuan and four jiao per dan of salt. Chiang also sent representatives to receive them.</p>
<p>Requests from the Banking Community for Financial Relief Managers of Central, China, Yumin, Municipal, Construction, and Guohuo Banks, including Ji Shenzhai, jointly visited Chiang this morning, stating that the city's finances were depleted due to the communist bandit influence and requesting financial relief.</p>
<p>Grand Petition from Eighty-One Counties The Jiangxi Eighty-One Counties Fellow Villagers Union Petition Delegation, at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, gathered at the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters, with over eighty representatives selected by the fellow villagers associations of the eighty-one counties in the province, holding petition banners and marching in formation to Chairman Chiang's Executive Headquarters to petition Chairman Chiang. At the time, Chairman Chiang had already gone to the Provincial Government. Therefore, petition representatives Xie Zhaoxiong and Huang Shaolu contacted Li Si, the adjutant of the Executive Headquarters, expressing their intentions and requesting Chiang to quickly eradicate the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province, allocate funds to provide disaster relief to the victims, and properly plan for post-disaster recovery. After speaking, they also requested that a written petition be delivered to Chairman Chiang. Adjutant Li promised to convey everything accordingly. On the way back, they also went to the Jiangxi Grand Hotel to petition He Chengjun, the Commander-in-Chief of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces Bandit Suppression. First, the representatives expressed their intentions to petition, and Commander-in-Chief He responded in a very satisfactory manner. They then dispersed. It is said that the petition delegation, due to not meeting Chiang, decided to gather the petition representatives from various counties again at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to petition Chairman Chiang.

<h3 id="e71">Victory Report on Bandit Suppression in Northeastern Hubei <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Telegraphed About the Attack on Huang'an</p>
<p>Yue Weijun's Troops Recaptured Xiaohexi</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the two communist bandit forces of He Long and Kuang Jixun fled to Hunan Province, the most rampant communist bandits in Hubei Province were those in Huang'an in Eastern Hubei and the Huangxiao area in Northern Hubei. In order to quickly eradicate the communist bandits in that area, the Wuhan Military Headquarters specifically tasked the 16th Route Army Commander-in-Chief Xu Yuanquan and the New 1st Division Commander Yue Weijun to be responsible for the suppression. Xu, responsible for Eastern Hubei, has led the 48th Division, 44th Division, 13th Division, 26th Division, and air force to defeat the bandit army repeatedly, pressing directly on Huang'an City. Yue, responsible for Northern Hubei, has also recaptured Xiaohexi, which had long been occupied by bandits. The remaining bandits in both areas are on the verge of being completely annihilated. The recent suppression situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Eastern Hubei Huang'an County in Eastern Hubei has long been occupied by communist bandits. Commander-in-Chief of the Military Headquarters He Chengjun specifically dispatched the 10th Army to suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, Army Commander Xu Yuanquan led his troops of the 48th Division and Xiao Zhichu's 44th Division from Hubei towards Huang'an, arriving completely on the 4th and 5th. On the 6th, they began attacking Huang'an. At that time, Lu Bentang's brigade of the 13th Division was stationed in Macheng to prevent the bandits from fleeing far away, while still maintaining close contact with the Xu and Xiao divisions. On the 7th, Xu ordered a general offensive. Xiao's Division's Wang Jinyong Brigade was stationed in the Greater and Lesser Jinshan Mountains, and Zhang's regiment was stationed in Taohua and Nanlilin Store. Xu's Division's Han Changjun Brigade also advanced to Xiedian, and Zhang Zhenhan Brigade advanced to Yinjia River, attacking Huang'an County City together. The remaining troops were stationed in Songbu, Qiting, and Xinzhou to maintain vigilance. Xu himself traveled back and forth between Songbu and Cangzibu to command and respond. After the bandits were severely suppressed, most of them fled to Tuanbei on the border of Huang and Ma, with very few stationed in the county city. Believing that the main force of the bandits had been defeated, Xu planned to return to Hankou with Xiao Zhichu in the coming days. He telegraphed the 10th Army Office, reporting the suppression situation: "According to a telegram from Xiao's Division Gengyi, since dawn today, the bandit army on the Greater Jinshan Mountain was simultaneously encircled and suppressed by my Wang Brigade, Gong Regiment, and Chen Brigade from Jinshan Store and Dujia Liangting. Concentrated artillery fire was used to bombard them for two hours, killing many bandits. Unable to resist, they crossed the river from Yang'er Port and Chenjia River and fled to the northeast. My Gong Regiment took advantage of the situation to pursue fiercely, successively occupying Yingzhua Mountain and Yanghuo Mountain. At the same time, Wang Brigade and Zhang Regiment continued to search and advance towards Gaoqiao River, etc. Also, according to a phone report from Brigade Commander Zhang, today Wang Zhenkun's regiment has occupied Xiedian, and Huang Xin's regiment has occupied Yinjia River, and has established contact with Xiao's division. The communist bandits offered no resistance and fled northwards. Special telegram to inform, and forward to the Military Headquarters. Xu Yuanquan Qi Xu Yin, One."</p>
<p>Northern Hubei Xiaohexi, near the Huayuan area in Northern Hubei, has been occupied by communist bandits for several years, gathering tens of thousands of people. The central government has repeatedly sent troops to suppress them, but they have not been eliminated. New 1st Division Commander Yue Weijun was recently ordered to return from the front to Huayuan, responsible for protecting the road and suppressing the bandits. On the 2nd of this month, he specifically dispatched Wang Junjie's entire brigade to suppress the bandits. On the 3rd, they arrived at Wushizhai. On the 4th, at 10:00 AM, they departed from the fortress and advanced in two directions. Upon reaching Zhangjia Bridge, they encountered the bandits. About 2,000 bandits had built strong fortifications at Zhaoshu Gang and resisted stubbornly. After a fierce attack by the right-wing army's 8th Regiment Commander Wang Zhiqiang, the bandits were unable to resist and fled towards Xiaohexi. The regiment took advantage of the victory to pursue, and within about two hours, completely recaptured Xiaohexi, killing many bandits on the spot and seizing countless war spoils. They then took advantage of the victory to search and simultaneously recaptured the nearby Daguan Mountain and Xiaoguan Mountain. However, the bandits along the mountains relied on their high and dangerous positions and were very stubborn. After an attack by the right-wing army's 7th Regiment Commander Zheng's regiment, a fierce battle of two hours was difficult to resolve quickly. However, Wang Brigade Commander's reinforcements arrived, assisting the regiment with artillery and machine guns to fiercely bombard the mountain peaks. The bandits began to falter and retreated behind the mountains. Zheng's regiment completely occupied all the mountain peaks at 1:00 PM. Just as they were resting, the bandits launched a counterattack. Wang Brigade Commander Junjie personally led the pistol team, artillery platoon, and machine gun battalion to meet the attack head-on, while ordering Wang Zhiqiang's regiment to encircle and suppress from the left wing and Dang Haizong's battalion from the right wing. They immediately defeated the bandits, killing over 800 bandits and seizing over 300 rifles and dozens of horses. Upon hearing the news, Yue personally inspected the Zhaoshugang area on the 6th, leading the special service battalion from Huayuan. He immediately ordered all troops to thoroughly search and suppress Daguan Mountain, Xiaoguan Mountain, Huashanzhai Dianshan Temple, Menshuanling, Huangjiafan and other places near Xiaohexi, and properly allocated defense areas. It was reported on the 9th that he had returned to Huayuan and planned to come to Hankou in the coming days to welcome Commander-in-Chief Chiang and report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He on the recapture of Xiaohexi.

<p>Jingdezhen Correspondence: Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, was captured three times by the communist bandits Fang and Shao</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Since occupying Jingdezhen, the bandits had been entrenched for two months. It was not until the 20th of this month, when news arrived that the Anhui army was about to arrive in the town, that they completely retreated to Leping that evening. Before leaving, they kidnapped dozens of hostages and attempted to set fire to a large area. Fortunately, the national army advanced very quickly, and the bandits, fearing pursuit, fled. On the morning of the 21st, Deputy Division Commander Li of the 55th Division led the entire division to Jingdezhen. The general public, having suffered greatly under the communist bandits for a long time, eagerly anticipated the arrival of the troops. Upon hearing of the army's arrival, they were overjoyed, setting off firecrackers and hanging banners in a very enthusiastic manner. The division immediately dispatched troops to track down and suppress the bandits, arresting dozens of bandits in Yongshan, Leping, and other places, and immediately executing them. After several days of strict inspections, a communist bandit organization was uncovered in Licun, Floating County. Currently, order has been restored throughout the town, and the people's hearts are at ease. However, the city has been devastated by the bandits, and any slightly reputable shops have been completely confiscated, resulting in a shortage of goods, making it difficult to recover in the short term. The investigation revealed that the most significant losses were in the following industries: The cloth industry, including Hesheng, Dechang, Huaxing, Chengdaosheng, Dayuanchang, and several other shops, suffered a total loss of over 400,000 yuan. The southern goods industry, including Shutianhe, lost over 40,000 yuan. Hu Hongfa, Jiang Bangda, and others also suffered considerable losses. The foreign goods industry, including Wang Renfa, Zhongxi, Zhongfa, Luo Yuanxing, Gongshengkui, Cha Yushun, and several other shops, suffered a total loss of over 300,000 yuan. There were many other losses of four or five thousand yuan, which cannot be detailed. (November 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Zhang Xueliang's Remarks After Arriving in Tianjin <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Excellent Impressions of the Trip to the Capital</p>
<p>Post-War Reconstruction in the Northwest is Easy to Begin</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Vice Commander Zhang Xueliang participated in the Fourth Plenary Session during this trip to Beijing and provided much support for the plan to reorganize the situation in the North. In the past twenty-odd days, the situation in the North has gradually stabilized. With Wang, Yan, and Feng successively leaving Shanxi, military and political affairs can be gradually reorganized. However, the four northeastern provinces have complex administrative affairs. Due to the inconvenience of Acting Governor Zhang Zuoxiang making independent decisions on many important policies, he repeatedly telegraphed the central government to request Zhang's return to the north quickly. Zhang departed from Beijing on the 5th of this month and arrived in Tianjin by special train at 7:30 AM on the 6th. In addition to the people who accompanied him, Chairman Chiang specifically dispatched Liu Guang, Director of the First Bureau of the General Staff, and Gao Lingbai, Secretary of the National Government, to escort him to Tianjin. The Tianjin military and political authorities had already begun preparations to welcome Zhang. Both the East and West railway stations were decorated with colorful arches, adorned with welcoming words, and illuminated with electric lights in the evening, creating a very brilliant atmosphere. The inside of the stations was also extensively decorated with electric and gas lights, creating the atmosphere of a city that never sleeps. Welcoming personnel were assigned specific positions. White lines were drawn on the platforms to ensure that everyone stood within the lines, and powdered signs were erected with the names of the organizations and groups, so that they could stand in their respective places and avoid disorder. Security within the stations was handled by the public security bureau's security team and soldiers from the 25th Brigade stationed in Tianjin. The area from the North Exit of the Japanese Concession to outside the West Station, and from the Jingang Bridge of the French Concession to outside the East Station, was guarded by a sentry monitoring pedestrians every ten steps, but traffic was not completely cut off. Hebei Chairman Wang Shuchang, Directors Lin Chengxiu, Chang Bingyi, Ke Yufang, Yao Hong, Zhang Jian'an, Wang Yuke, Mayor Zang Qifang, and various bureau chiefs, customs supervisors Han Linsheng, Hong Weiguo, Wang Shouchong, and other important figures took special trains that evening to Machang, where they met Zhang in person to discuss important political matters. The other welcoming organizations and groups, numbering about three hundred people, greeted him at the East and West railway stations. At 5:10, the vanguard arrived, and Zhang's special train arrived at the West Station at 7:30, stopping briefly before departing. He got off the train at the East Station and took a car to his private residence in the concession. Those who were welcoming also rushed to the residence to pay their respects. The gatekeeper said that the Vice Commander was resting temporarily due to fatigue from the journey and would not be able to receive guests until 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The people then dispersed. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, the reporter visited Zhang at his residence. Zhang said that he had gained excellent impressions from his trip to Beijing. The central authorities are very motivated and take responsibility for everything. Chairman Chiang has a strong spirit and is determined to govern the country well, with genuine sincerity. China is a vast and complex society, and there are many difficulties in everything. It is inevitable that a small number of elements cannot be completely satisfactory, but overall, it cannot but be considered satisfactory. Chiang has recently been receptive to advice, such as the preparatory convocation of the National Assembly, the reorganization of party organizations, and the recruitment and employment of talented people outside the party, all of which are the result of adopting dissenting opinions from various parties. From now on, if we can cooperate with one heart and one mind and govern together, the country's future will be truly promising. The reporter asked about the post-war reconstruction in the Northwest. Zhang said that since Yan and Feng have already left, there will be no problems in starting the post-war reconstruction. Shanxi's affairs will be handled by Shang Zhen. Given a reasonable amount of time, things will gradually get on track. Military affairs will be easier to arrange. The reporter asked if the Vice Commander wanted to meet with Yan Xishan. Zhang said that if Mr. Yan wanted to meet, he would have no objections. If he comes to visit, he will be received. Finally, the reporter further asked whether the finances and transportation of the Northeast would be entirely managed by the central government. Zhang said that not only the Northeast, but all of the North should be under a unified government. However, the local authorities should of course also have the power and responsibility to manage and propose. For example, the Northeast Transportation Committee will not be abolished, which is the meaning of this. As a result of the abolition of the likin tax, local revenues have sharply decreased, so all military and administrative expenses of local governments should be transferred from the central government's revenue. If there is a shortfall, the central government will assist. If there is a surplus, it will be handed over to the central government. This is the common practice of finance in various countries. Zhang said that he was particularly pleased with this trip, first, because it was decided that the likin tax would be abolished on January 1st of next year without further delay, which would have a positive impact on the national economy, and second, because the negotiations with Russia were also making progress. At this point, the reporter excused himself. He met Zhu Guangmu, who said that party affairs in the Northeast were already being prepared. After Qiang returns, he will lead all military personnel to join the party. Local party branches will also begin to be organized. Zhang is about to return to Shenyang because Zhang Zuoxiang is eager to return to Jilin to handle provincial affairs. Zhang will enter the customs again after Liaoning's affairs are completed, because there is nothing that must be done in Peiping at this time, so he will not go to Peiping. It is said that Zhang plans to leave the customs in three or four days. (December 7th)</p>

<p>Japanese Police Protect Illegal Korean Residents</p>
<p>Assaulting and Arresting Customs Officers</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Andong County is a large station on the South Manchurian Railway, with a prosperous market and abundant production. It also has so-called attached areas, where many Japanese and Korean residents live. Therefore, the diplomatic situation is more complicated than in other inland areas. On the 28th of last month, a case occurred in which Korean residents gathered to destroy the Jiangqiao branch of our country's customs office and assaulted our customs officers. Negotiations have not yet been resolved to this day. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, about thirty Korean residents, each holding wooden sticks and carrying smuggled goods in their waists, arrived at the customs checkpoint. Seeing customs officers conducting inspections, the Korean residents attempted to rush through, swarming forward and surrounding the customs officers, subjecting them to verbal abuse and insults. At the time, Ding of Patrol Team No. 7 was seriously injured. Afterwards, the Korean residents left triumphantly. Unexpectedly, one wave subsided, and another wave rose. At around 8:00 PM that evening, four more Korean residents, each carrying several catties of copper coins, crossed the customs gate from Jiangqiao and passed behind the Japanese bridge-guarding police station, hoping to smuggle them. This was seen by a patrol team who stepped forward to stop them. The four Korean residents, seeing that they had been exposed, scattered and fled. Three of them escaped, leaving only one behind. Ninety catties of copper coins were found in his waist. At the time, the Japanese police were on the scene, turning a blind eye and not stopping them. When the Korean resident became anxious and bit a patrolman, the patrolman used legitimate defense to resist with the wooden stick he was carrying. Unexpectedly, the Japanese police immediately stepped forward, grabbed the patrolman, and used extreme violence. After negotiations with the officer on duty, they not only ignored him but were also extremely barbaric, using both fists and feet. As a result, the patrol team was arrested by the Japanese police and detained at the headquarters. Since these two incidents occurred, all Chinese officers of the Andong Customs Outer Bureau believe that the Japanese are instigating Korean residents to make things difficult for the customs, and that if this continues, the consequences will be dire. Personnel from various branches in the Japanese Concession agreed to go on strike to show their resistance, await a resolution through negotiations, and issued a declaration on the 4th, sending it to various provinces in Northeast China to raise public awareness. The declaration stated: "Japanese imperialists, wielding unequal treaties as a talisman and consular jurisdiction as a tool, with military force as a backing, using the concession as a breeding ground for evil, protecting tax evasion, and doing their utmost to insult our administrative personnel. Our customs personnel, concerned with our national revenue and their duties, cannot sit idly by against the tax evasion of Japanese and Korean residents. The Japanese authorities are indulging these fierce and unruly elements, carrying out assaults and insults at will, resulting in customs officers Zhang Chengming, Yu Luomin, Yu Chuanjie, Wang Huachun, Wang Guofan, and others being seriously injured one after another. They have also instigated Korean residents to destroy the customs office, with He Jun Jiayu almost being drowned in the Yalu River, and Guard Yang Shuqi being beaten nearly to death. Although the customs authorities have negotiated with them in many ways, they not only ignore them but also intensify their efforts, interfering in our administration by force and insulting our staff. Customs officers Xie Guodong, Guan Guangyan, Wu Jingwen, Yu Chuanjie, Lin Wanzhi, Chen Weitao, Zhou Maoxu, and others have been unreasonably detained and abused by the Japanese police station. As if that were not enough, they have incited Korean residents to attack our branches every night, and the lives of our customs officers on duty are often in danger. At around 6:00 PM on the 2nd of this month, Wang Yuecheng, a guard of our customs, was beaten by Korean residents at the Iron Bridge branch for suppressing smuggling. The Japanese police did not ask right or wrong, but arrested the guard and took him to the police station, tying him up with ropes and using both fists and feet, beating him for more than two hours, resulting in injuries all over his body. Our inspector and customs officer Guan Guangyan went to reason with them, but was also insulted and driven away. Such ferocity, barbarity, and disregard for the law is outrageous and infuriating. We, the undersigned, are unable to perform our duties and our lives are in danger and without protection. Therefore, as a last resort, we are temporarily going on strike at all branches in the Japanese Concession, awaiting negotiations by the authorities. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the true situation, we hereby issue this declaration." After receiving the above declaration, various popular groups and national diplomacy associations in Shenyang were indignant at the Japanese protecting Korean residents and acting lawlessly. They are currently discussing ways to respond. (December 7th)</p>

<p>The Old and New Committees of the Relief Institute Have Not Completed the Takeover. The County Relief Preparatory Committee, due to its ineffectiveness, was reorganized by a resolution of the Provisional Local Council, and the County Government separately appointed committee members to re-establish the committee. The old preparatory committee refused to recognize the process as illegal and declared to the County Government that it had separately telegraphed the Ministry of Interior and the Provincial Government for instructions and would only comply with them. Before receiving clear instructions, it would be inappropriate to transfer the work without authorization, thus violating the legal process. The County Government, upon receiving the report, immediately issued an order on the 3rd reprimanding them not to resist and cause inconvenience. Therefore, the new committee side yesterday dispatched Chairman Ruan Xiyao, accompanied by committee member Zhuang Qingqi, etc., to take over. Because the committee did not send anyone to contact them, they inquired about the handling of the matter yesterday. They were instructed that the case had been resolved by the Local Council and had been approved with a record, so the committee could not refuse to hand over the work on the pretext of it not being authorized. The Chairman, etc., should be responsible for going to take over the work. If they truly refused to hand over the work, they should report it for review and seizure. The new committee has re-scheduled the takeover date and has requested the County Supervisory Committee to send personnel to assist in the handling of the matter. It is not known whether the result will be satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Dai Jitao's Telegram to Teachers and Students in Guangdong <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Hoping for Shared Virtue and Common Belief in the University,</p>
<p>Unanimously Welcoming Principal Jin's Swift Assumption of Office</p>
<p>President Dai, Chairman of the Board of Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University, telegraphed the school's faculty and students yesterday, saying: "To Director Shen Pengfei of Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University and all faculty, staff, and students: Your telegrams received. I have heard that recently, university students have been unsettled and full of discussions due to the change of university president. Hearing this from afar, I deeply regret that our school is a university personally founded by the Premier and the only institution of higher learning in the South. After many twists and turns, it has finally stabilized. For the past three years, the faculty, staff, and all students have shared virtues and worked together, each pursuing their studies. The excellent academic atmosphere is praised throughout the country. Now that the overall situation is settled, all construction should be actively pursued. For the various construction projects of our school, it will not be successful without someone focusing on responsibility. The Central Government has repeatedly resolved that the university president cannot concurrently hold other positions. Chuanxian repeatedly declined positions in the Central Government, but was not permitted. Therefore, on one hand, I suggested to the Central Government to establish a university board of directors to assume responsibility for construction, and on the other hand, I requested the Central Government to appoint President Zhu to be in charge of university administration. Recently, with the resignation of the president of the Central University, it was decided to transfer President Zhu to Beijing. Regarding the selection of a candidate for our school, after repeated deliberations and with the unanimous approval of the board members in Beijing, Mr. Jin Xiangfan was appointed as the president. Mr. Xiangfan is an advanced member of our party, and his contributions to education in Guangdong are deeply appreciated by the Central Government. If he can devote himself wholeheartedly to the university, all future construction will surely follow the Premier's will and continue the established direction with effort. Chuanxian and other board members will do their best to assist him, hoping for its completion. The most important thing at present is that the faculty, staff, and students should share virtues and unite in one heart, unanimously obeying the Central Government's orders and President Jin's guidance. You must know that the government and the board of directors are more thoughtful about the university's future than the students, and their responsibility for the university's future is also more practical than the students'. The students must not listen to rumors and create suspicions to destroy the established good academic atmosphere and endanger the university's future construction. I deeply hope that you will understand this and, with a spirit of kinship, uphold the common belief in the university and unanimously welcome President Jin's swift assumption of office. Not only will the comrades in the Central Government be at ease, but the new bright future of the university will also be further advanced from this point. I will wait until my official duties are slightly more free and will definitely return to the school with Director Sun Zhesheng at the end of the year and the beginning of the year to jointly plan the construction project of the new school building. Words cannot express everything, please understand. Chuanxian respectfully kowtows."</p>

<h3 id="e91">Elementary School Party Doctrine Speech Competition <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>—Today's Second Group Preliminary—</p>
<p>The First Group's Preliminary Was Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Five Winning Members Were Selected</p>
<p>The city's elementary school Party Doctrine speech competition was convened by the Municipal Training Department at 1:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium on the third floor of the Municipal Party Headquarters. More than 300 people attended, including representatives from 20 schools and audience members. The meeting started on time, presided over by Jiang Tanshu. The situation was very grand. The second group will be convened at 1:00 PM this afternoon to continue the preliminary. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue: The Municipal Training Department arranged the venue in advance. The two large characters "Listen Attentively" were hung on the stage, followed by the words "Shanghai Elementary School Student Party Doctrine Speech Competition, First Group". The venue order was quite solemn and orderly. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, representatives from various schools and listeners arrived one after another, full of energy. First, lots were drawn to determine the order of speeches, and then the preliminary began as scheduled. The judges all adopted anonymous methods according to the lot numbers to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Briefly stated, today's Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters Training Department's elementary school Party Doctrine speech competition is an initiative. The mission of the Training Department is to deeply root the Three Principles of the People in the hearts of the masses, and training elementary school students is a fundamental method. For example, if you want a tree to have tight branches and lush leaves, the cultivation of its roots and wood still requires attention to sowing and sprouting. Therefore, training elementary school students is very important. The holding of this Party Doctrine speech competition, on the one hand, promotes the development of the Three Principles of the People, and on the other hand, enables elementary school students to have a deeper understanding of Party Doctrine. Although all elementary schools have a Party Doctrine course, they are perfunctory and cannot be completely without process. After this competition, the excellent ones will know to work harder, and the inferior ones will know to be more vigilant. Then the development of Party Doctrine education can have a new motivation from this point. Therefore, this elementary school Party Doctrine speech competition held by the Municipal Training Department is of great importance, and so on.</p>
<p>Names of Winning Members: The performances of all participants in yesterday's preliminary were excellent. However, due to the limited number of places, only five were selected: first (Bide) Zhang Hesheng, second (Jiancheng) Xu Zhenyu, third (Shangwen) Jiang Derong, fourth (Meixi) Zhou Zengye, fifth (Suzhou Luhai) Xu Meichi. The judges were Wu Xianren, Zhou Yingcai, Zhou Shang, and Li Zheng. The chief judge was Jiang Huaisu.</p>
<p>Today's Preliminary: Today's second preliminary will be held. The list is as follows: Liuyun, (Zhu Zishen) Xunyu, (Shao Runlin) Aiqun (Liu Fubao) Minzhi, (Zhang Wei) Nanqu (Zhao Ruying) Gaochang (Wu Gen) Yucai, (Shen Yiding) Mingde, (Liu Ruonan) Yangzheng, (Zhu Jiwu) Wuzou, (Xiong Minghui) Huabao (Ye Junhui) Shanggong (Jiang Douliang) Motang, (Jia Shanren) Qingxin (Cen Liren) Cangji, (Bu Shugan) Chengze, (Li Changhua) Meilan, (Mei Hongyun) Guangzhao Girls' Elementary, (Ma Xuemin) Qiujiang, (Yan Jinfa) Chaozong, (Zhang Runlin) Yongxing, (Xiao Yushu) It is also heard that the judges for today's preliminary are Cheng Kuanzheng, (Principal of Municipal Wusong Public School) Jishi, (Former Chief of the Party Member Training Section of the Zhejiang Provincial Training Department) Yan Wenwei, (Director of Moral Education of Minli Middle School) Zhou Hanmei, (Chief of the Guidance Section of the Municipal Propaganda Department) The preliminary chairman and judge is Jiang Huaisu.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Zhang Yuejun and Others Host a Banquet to Raise Funds for the Capital Women's College <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, Zhang Yuejun, Niu Yangsheng, Jiao Yitang, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai and others hosted a banquet at Jue Lin to solicit construction funds for the Capital Women's Law College. More than 40 people attended, including Zhao Jinqing, Mei WanHua, Wen Lanting, Wu Zhihao, Xu Weizhen, Wang Fengqing, Wang Jingqi, Wang Hongpang, Madam Niu, Madam Jiao, and Ms. Bao. Niu Yongjian stood up to give a speech, briefly saying that the National Government, based on the principle of equality between men and women established by the Premier, is earnestly seeking its realization. The Legislative Yuan recently formulated the Civil Code, based on this purpose. Therefore, in law, women have completely obtained equal status. However, in order for women to exercise equal rights, they must have considerable political and legal knowledge. The comrades founded the Capital Women's Law College to cultivate such talents. Now there is a base, and active progress is being made. However, the construction of the college buildings still requires huge funds. The comrades are weak and have to rely on the great strength and enthusiasm of the gentlemen in Shanghai to help. Next, Mayor Zhang spoke, briefly saying that the Capital Women's Law College was founded to promote national women's political and legal education. Therefore, we cannot regard it as a business in a corner of the capital. However, Shanghai has too many undertakings to handle. Almost all kinds of charitable construction projects everywhere come to talk to us, asking for help. However, some powerful people in Shanghai are unwilling to come out, and we cannot see them. The people who are willing to come out are always these few people. Sometimes it really feels too much to handle, and some people inevitably feel annoyed. In fact, we are in this position, and people from all sides trust us and ask us for help. We are very honored and should not feel annoyed. We were just talking about Bodhisattvas. We can say that we are like Bodhisattvas. For all kinds of requests from all sides, we should always do our best to satisfy their wishes. Taking advantage of this opportunity today, I will say a little meaning, hoping that the gentlemen present will tell those who are unwilling to come out that it is a very valuable thing in life to be requested by all parties. Today, Mr. Mei WanHua and Mr. Tan Wang have all come. After the contract of the Grand Stage is completed, they will perform charity shows for our Women's Law College, raising funds with artistic contributions. It must be more and easier than the donations we are soliciting now. Then, Yu Qiaqing, Jiao Yitang, Wang Xiaolai and other gentlemen spoke one after another, and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant. When the bell rang three times, they dispersed with joy. It is reported that the construction costs were separately recognized by those who arrived, and the funds donated were not small.</p>

The following resolutions were made: (1) Zhou Xianyan (Lehua), Lu Zhongen (Guohua), Li Ning (Guohua), Feng Yunyou (Jinda), Jiang Shanjing (Jinda), Chen Pu (Lingnan), Chen Zhenhe (Jindai), Zhuang Shihong (Jinda), Shen Lan (Jiaoda), Liang Shutang (Jinda), Dai Linjing (Jinda), Chen Yutian, (Lehua) Chen Jiaqiu, (Jinda) Xi Qiaosheng, (Guanghua) Cao Guicheng, (Lehua) Mei Honggui, (Jinda) Fei Fuxu, (Jiaoda) Ji Haiguang, (Jinda) Chen Bingxiang (Jinda) and nineteen others were selected as Shanghai Chinese team members to prepare for participation in this year's International Football Competition, and Wu Yanzhang was appointed as coach and Ma Detai as manager. (2) Three protests in the league. (A) The Beicheng team protested that the Dajiang team used the names of players who had not joined the competition on the match report. The matter was proven. The Dajiang team should forfeit the match and be given a warning. (B) The Anglo-American team protested that the referee's decision was improper. It was resolved to ask the referee to provide a detailed report of the match for further processing. (C) Yaxiyia protested that the Zhendan B team used a player who had used someone else's name to join the competition and used the names of players who had not joined the competition to replace the names of players on the match report. After various parties proved that the protest was true, the Zhendan team cheated for profit, violating the spirit of sports. In addition to forfeiting the match with the Yaxiyia team, they were also penalized with a fine of five yuan. It was also decided that if such cases of impersonation are found in the future, the team will be immediately suspended from the entire season's competition to maintain the spirit of the league.</p>

<p>The Two Rivers women's team played a friendly match against the West Qing Red team at the China Basketball Hall at 6:00 PM yesterday. The two teams fought fiercely. As a result, Two Rivers won by a score of twenty-nine to twenty-one. The referee was Hui Tuofei. Most of the spectators were students from Two Rivers and outside guests, totaling about five or six hundred people, which can be described as a grand occasion. At the beginning of the match, the Red team showed their sharpness, and Two Rivers worked hard to counterattack. The situation was very intense. In the first quarter, Two Rivers won by a score of seven to six. However, the two teams can be said to be evenly matched, and the scores went up and down, making it difficult to judge. By the end of the first half, the Red team was ahead by one point, with a score of twelve to eleven.</p>
<p>After the break, the Red team improved significantly, and the score difference was once three points. The Red team once took the lead with sixteen to thirteen. Two Rivers worked hard to counterattack, and soon leveled the score and surpassed it with seventeen to sixteen. After competing for a long time, the Red team won again with eighteen to seventeen. So up and down, each rushing forward, until twenty to nineteen (the Red team took the lead), the Two Rivers momentum suddenly rose, and Xi Jun and Shao Jinying each scored, and the scores soared, winning cheers and thunderous applause. As a result, Two Rivers won with twenty-nine to twenty-one.</p>

<p>One of the Most Exciting Events in the Jiangnan University Football Tournament</p>
<p>Negotiating with the North Station to Add Trains to Facilitate the Audience</p>
<p>The Strongest Teams in Jiangnan University are Jinan University and Jiaotong University. This Saturday, the two will meet in Zhenru for a final battle. General football enthusiasts and fans, as well as those who have been waiting eagerly, will go with great interest. The Jinan University authorities are mindful of this and specially sent a letter to the North Station Transportation Department yesterday to negotiate for additional trains during the period. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, according to the Jiangnan Eight University Football Championship, in previous years, every time our school played against Jiaotong University, it caused a sensation in Shanghai. The enthusiasm was no less than that of Harvard vs. Yale in the United States or Cambridge vs. Oxford in the United Kingdom. This year, according to the regulations of the Jiangnan University Sports Association, the Jiaotong University football team should come to our school to compete at 2:30 PM on the 13th of this month (Saturday). That day happens to be a Saturday afternoon break, and it is expected that there will be many Chinese and foreign people attending the event. The traffic from the North Station to Zhenru is safest and fastest on your route. In order to encourage sports interest and facilitate public transportation, our school specially refers to the precedents of advanced countries around the world and sincerely requests your department to temporarily add special trains from the North Station to Zhenru and from Zhenru to the North Station at 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM respectively on that afternoon to facilitate the audience, which will also be a small supplement to your department's income. We have always admired Minister Sun and your department for promoting sports and being familiar with it. You will certainly be happy to sponsor this annual famous university football match. If you agree, please reply as soon as possible, and also ask your department to notify the Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city as soon as possible so that everyone will know. We will be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Zheng Hongnian, President of National Jinan University, to Liu, Deputy Director Zheng, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Transportation Department."</p>

<p>There were three groups of West Qing basketball matches yesterday. All were the final matches of Group A. The scene of the Pirates vs. McLings was extremely exciting. The ball went back and forth repeatedly, never stopping. The Pirates had a good lead of nineteen to eleven in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, McLings scored three consecutive goals, causing the Pirates to lose their color. Fortunately, Zheng Lei replaced Hans for the battle, and the results were excellent, and the Pirates were able to maintain their winning momentum, finally winning with a score of thirty-four to twenty-five. The two games before it were quite different in level and were not very exciting. They could not be compared with the final scene. Results: (1) Laoda wins Red Team with 29-16 (2) East China wins Shanghai with 37-26.</p>

However, the Pudong team did not receive this letter and arrived at Nanyang at 2:30 PM yesterday, but the field was still wet and could not be used, so the match did not take place.</p>

<p>Seven to Zero—The Central University Team Will Go to Suzhou for a Match Today</p>
<p>The Central University Sports Department football team, led by coach Jin Zhaojun, came to Shanghai for sightseeing. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, they played a friendly match with the Jiaotong University football team at Jiaotong University. In the 90-minute battle, Jiaotong University, with its home-field advantage, showed great power, causing the visiting guests to suffer greatly. Was it not too unappreciative of the scenery? As a result, Jiaotong University won a complete victory with a score of seven to zero. The referee was He Chunhui.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Jiaotong University's Hegemony Reborn <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Jiaotong University football team has always been known for its elite and invincible strength, holding the top position in Shanghai. In recent years, its star players have scattered, and its strength has declined. Only in the recent battles with Fudan and Guangfu Central have there been special improvements. It is thought that the Jiaotong University's hegemony will have a trend of rebirth. Jiaotong University uses strong men to occupy various internal positions, so as to prevent the invasion of powerful enemies. The five external forwards are agile and quick. Every time they gain momentum, the five routes advance, and the defenders are always confused and do not know where to follow. With internal strength and external sharpness, able to attack and defend, the future of Jiaotong University is truly unlimited.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Central University Trapped in Wetlands <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Central University football team has excellent qualifications and can be trained. Coach Jin plans to conquer Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Suzhou to increase the team's experience. Yesterday, the team suffered a great blow from Jiaotong University because they were not accustomed to wetland warfare. However, the activity of its two wings and the solidity of the goalkeeper added color to the team. The biggest weakness is that the external forwards and internal guards cannot unite as one. Perhaps the field was muddy and slippery, making it inconvenient to advance and retreat, causing heroes to have no place to use their abilities.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Jiaotong University Team <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>

<p>The mobilization order was issued, and the fierce battle began. Jiaotong University passed the ball three or four times and passed it to Fei Fuxu's feet. He picked it up out of thin air and crossed it in front of the goal from the crowd. Both sides' soldiers missed it. Jiaotong University's Liu Ximeng and Xue Wenxiu shot one after another, but none of them hit the target. The ball's momentum turned and a storm arose in front of Jiaotong University's goal. There was a melee within five steps for a long time, but Jiaotong University did not lose the goal, which was fortunate. Before long, Jiaotong University launched a counterattack and shot many times, but it was either blocked by the internal guards or blocked by the goalkeeper. After a long time, in the last five minutes, Zhang Jingyong headed the ball in. In the first half, Jiaotong University took the lead with one to zero.</p>

<p>In the second half, Jiaotong University's overly active forwards scattered the enemy everywhere, so they took the lead and were always on the offensive. Central University also made some progress in the first ten minutes, but Jiaotong University's Wang Gongchen, with his strong feet and calm attitude, dominated the rear, coupled with the cooperation of the forwards and the stability of the goalkeeper, Central University's several attacks all ended in failure. From then on, Jiaotong University's athletes were often seen in the Central University area, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, feinting to the east and attacking the west, and encircling from the left and right. Central University's heavy troops held the defense and maintained it with hard work. After ten battles and ten rounds, they were unable to break through. Central University suddenly broke out of the encirclement and launched a counterattack. Jiaotong University was caught off guard and was invaded into the hinterland. Suddenly, a kick hit the goal, but the kicker was already offside, so it was invalid even if it hit the goal.</p>

<p>Jiaotong University used the short pass method to break through the Central University defense line. The right wing Xue Wenxiu picked the ball with precision, and the left wing Fei Fuxu shot with power. Central University's dragon gate lost the second goal. In the next twenty minutes, Jiaotong University continued to add five goals, which was extremely easy. Gong Yibin won the third goal and shot it while falling, which was very beautiful. Wan Mian's winning of the fourth goal was due to his own dexterity. The fifth goal was scored when Xue Wenxiu kicked a corner kick and fell into the crowd, and the Central University internal guard kicked it in himself. The sixth goal was scored by Fei Fuxu with a backhand kick, which was calm and powerful, thus winning the seventh goal. Liu Ximeng broke through and went straight in, and the goalkeeper got it back and lost it again. As a result, Jiaotong University won by a score of seven goals.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Record of the Unveiling of the Monument to the Former Principal of the Minli School <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Two years after the beginning of the new education in our country, that is, in the 30th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, Minli Middle School emerged on the Huangxie River. The founder was Mr. Su Junshang, whom we praise today. At that time, the number of students who came to study was less than seventy, and the scale was simple. Compared with today's 1,548 students, 86 teachers, tens of thousands of alumni, and graduates all over the country, the school building is grander than a university, the difference is incalculable. Even if it is said that the current principal, Mr. Su Yingjie, has worked hard to achieve this, we should still remember that Mr. Junshang laid the foundation. The school held the unveiling ceremony of Mr. Junshang's monument at 10:30 a.m. on the 6th of this month. The reporter admired the man, so he attended with his family and recorded the grand occasion as follows.</p>
<p>The Monument The monument is located in the school's second sports field, in front of the new building built this year. The monument is rectangular in shape, with commemorative inscriptions in Chinese and English engraved on all sides. A steel half-body statue of Mr. Su is embedded on the top front, created by the artist Zhang Meisun, making people look up to it with admiration. At the top back is a steel pattern painted by Mr. Su's sixth son, Zuqi, which implies emphasis on commerce and learning, and hopes to promote it in the future. The idea is very beautiful and pleasing. It is said that railings will be added in the future to enhance the appearance. On that day, gifts from all walks of life were numerous, and wreaths surrounded the front and back of the monument, creating a solemn scene, which can be compared with Bismarck holding flowers to worship the old Emperor William.</p>
<p>Commemorative Words The Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, Mr. Xu Tao, arrived early in the morning and left after attending for more than an hour. Ma Xiangbo arrived the latest. He is ninety-one years old and in high spirits. When he gave his speech, the whole field was silent. Ma said that people are like sheep, and the government is like a shepherd holding a whip. The sheep only listen to the shepherd's orders, and their likes and dislikes are determined by others. There is no freedom in the world, and nothing is more unequal than this. Only a country that is formed by gathering people can maintain its equality and independent dignity if its people are rich in equality and independence. Mr. Junshang was able to establish a school under a despotic regime to cultivate people's equality and independence. His contribution is great and his ambition is admirable. Finally, he encouraged the students of the school to take Junshang's spirit as their spirit and Junshang's morality as their morality. Then, the representatives of the alumni association, Zhou Shoujuan, and the student union, Hu Jixun, delivered speeches. The words were short and meaningful, and they were very moving.</p>
<p>Commemorative Text The inscription on the monument was written by Sun Yengeng of Wujiang. The text reads: Ten years after Mr. Su's death, the teachers and staff of Minli School and his children missed his merits and virtues. They sighed and said, "South of the Yangtze River and on the Huangpu River, among the businessmen and industrialists who founded schools, there are Chengzhong in the north, Pudong in the east, and Minli in the south. The Ye and Yang families all have auspicious metal and stone to commemorate them, but Mr. Su alone is missing. There is no way to respect his virtues and repay his merits." They told the student council and the alumni association about this. Everyone said, "It is appropriate to erect a monument," and asked me to write the inscription. I said, "I am an old friend of Mr. Su. I know the Su family the most. How can I refuse to write?" The Su family has four brothers. The eldest is Benli, the second is Benyan, the third is Benqiao, and the youngest is Benhao. Benyan is Mr. Su. Benqiao is the current principal, Mr. Yingjie. He wanted to save the country through education and spent money to build this school. In the 30th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Yingjie was in charge of teaching affairs, and Mr. Su was in charge of school affairs. The Su family's wealth cannot be compared with that of the Ye and Yang families, so it is conceivable how difficult it was to create this school. Mr. Su was a heroic man. He did not hesitate to spend even ten thousand gold if it was something he should do. Therefore, his wealth was only average, but in the fifteen years before and after, the school's expenses relied on Mr. Su's support for most of the amount, as recorded in the epitaph written by Yao. However, Mr. Su's position was that of general manager, which is now called manager. He was in charge of everything in the school, not just finance. Mr. Su was the leader of the business community and was famous all over the world. He used his spare time to manage the school, and he had a high vision. Therefore, all major matters such as land allocation, foundation laying, art house, school relocation, land purchase, expansion, and application for funds and subsidies, although Mr. Yingjie worked hard, could be carried out smoothly thanks to Mr. Su's efforts. After Mr. Su's death, school affairs were concentrated on Mr. Yingjie, and he realized how virtuous and hardworking he was. The virtue of the Ye and Yang families lies in their ability to spend a lot of money to serve the people of their hometowns, but they did not participate in anything else. Compared with Mr. Su, how were their efforts and leisure? It is appropriate that people still miss him after his death and seek to make him immortal. Therefore, they collected more than 900 yuan of silver and erected a monument between the east and west school buildings. The teaching staff contributed five-tenths, the alumni association two-tenths, and the student union three-tenths. It should be recorded according to the rules. Alas, it has been ten years since Mr. Su's death. When I walked around the school, I felt that every tile, every brick, every grass, and every tree had Mr. Su's spirit in it. Why? I hope that the teachers and staff will take Mr. Su's heart as their heart, work diligently, and establish the people's workshop. The alumni association and the student union should contribute to construction and promote Mr. Su's glory. When they are on the road, passers-by will be surprised by their uniqueness, just like the people of the Song Dynasty said of Hu An's disciples, "This is a student of the Su family." Then Mr. Su's spirit will always be poured into the hearts and kidneys of everyone. Is this not more than erecting a monument to compare with Ye and Yang? This is what I and all of you should strive for together.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Anecdotes of Mr. Qiu Chuyu <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Dui Tian</p>
<p>Mr. Qiu, named Yanxi, with the courtesy name Chuyu, was from Liaoli, Dongshan, Wuxian, Jiangsu. His ancestors were farmers. When Mr. Qiu began to study, he dropped out of school halfway due to poverty and then entered the Kedahong firm to work. However, Mr. Qiu's ambition to improve himself never wavered. In his spare time, he often read books and newspapers to encourage himself. At that time, members of the Tongmenghui published newspapers such as "Min Hu," "Min Xu," "Min Li," and "Min Quan," which advocated revolution. Mr. Qiu was impressed by them. Every time a new issue came out, he would buy and save it from the first issue to the last. At this time, the Qing government was vigorously arresting party members. Not only were the writers in danger of being killed, but the readers were also in danger and dared not buy and read them openly. Only Mr. Qiu resolutely bought and read them as usual and saved them as usual. Others ridiculed him. The "Min Hu," "Min Xu," and other newspapers were published and suspended from time to time, and now they are lost without a trace. Only those saved by Mr. Qiu are complete from beginning to end. Now that the revolution has been accomplished, and the National Government has proposed collecting revolutionary history, Mr. Qiu planned to send the entire collection to the Revolutionary History Museum. Unfortunately, he died of scarlet fever in the winter of the previous year, which was a pity for those who heard about it. His wife, Ms. Song, gave birth to a daughter. The son of Mr. Qiu's third elder brother was adopted as his heir. After his death, his affairs were bleak. Mr. Qiu's friends sent the entire collection of "Min Hu," "Min Xu," "Min Quan," and "Min Li" newspapers saved by Mr. Qiu during his lifetime to the National Government to help with the revolutionary history in the future. It is said that a certain important person said that this kind of revolutionary historical material is extremely precious because it is not easy to collect. Therefore, the National Government plans to give a considerable reward to show its commemoration.</p>
<h3 id="e117">An Interview with Ms. Hu Die <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Mian Zi</p>
<p>The social lives, love lives, or family lives of some movie stars often receive great attention from many newspapers and magazines. Especially in the United States, even a female star losing a flower on her lapel becomes a good source of information for many movie newspapers and magazines. Recently, the case of Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Lin Xuehuai breaking off their engagement in the Chinese film industry has naturally attracted much attention from society. Therefore, I personally visited Ms. Hu at the Mingxing Company yesterday and had the following conversation with her.</p>
<p>Ms. Hu said, "I have always been opposed to the romantic atmosphere in the film industry in the past. For many years, I have been engaged in the film industry and I am fortunate to be able to maintain a good reputation. I am also fortunate to have won the sincere sympathy of many people in society. This matter is indeed unexpected. Although the outside world has some doubts about me, my pure heart will still be revealed clearly in the future. I don't want to say any more nonsense about this matter now. My life from now on will be to work harder in the film industry. I often believe that the success of a career is the best guarantee for all credit and reputation." Speaking of this, Ms. Hu remained silent for a long time, then said, "Sir, please go and see my new film, "The Singing Girl Red Peony". Women always have to suffer some losses." Ms. Hu suddenly smiled.</p>
<p>Later, I met the director of the company, Mr. Zheng Zhiqi. Mr. Zheng said, "Ms. Hu is very hardworking in film. This incident is really unfortunate for her. She has made many films in Mingxing. The most outstanding one is "Broken Qin Building". She is now working on the production of "The Tale of Laughter and Tears", and the results are getting better and better. As for "The Singing Girl Red Peony", it is also a sound film starring her. I believe it will have good results after it is released in the future. In the past few days, she has not been negative because of this unfortunate incident. According to her, it is inevitable for a person to have unexpected things in their life, so she still goes to the company to shoot films every day without any slack. I think, with Ms. Hu's current status, if she is willing to work hard, she will definitely have a lot of hope in the future."</p>

<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Wang Yantao said, "Since I came to Burma, I have also been infected by its customs. I seek a view of life where freedom is the best policy. I regard wealth as very light. But if the Burmese did not communicate with the outside world in the past and were purely Burmese, it would be fine. Everyone is free and good at giving to help each other. Now, the British, Indians, Chinese, and Japanese, all those who come to Burma, use all kinds of wisdom to seize the sources of wealth and leave. But those who come are not willing to give, so the Burmese are impoverished." I have heard that the Mongols are also like this, and they regard property as very light. This is because they have been influenced by Buddhism. I don't understand why the rich in China also know Buddhism, but they are very stingy. Why? Master Wanhui praised the high level of education and morality of the Burmese, and regarded the Chinese as vulgar, stingy, greedy, and scrambling for rights, making themselves beasts of burden for their children and grandchildren. Their style of chivalry and integrity is far from that of the Burmese. I said, "It's a pity that we don't use Buddhism to move the Europeans." My friend Zhang Xiangwen, a geographer, once said to me, "Try to observe the Mongols' heroism, which once overthrew the world. But since they were influenced by Buddhism, they have been docile to this day. If you want Europeans to be docile, you must spread Buddhism widely." I don't understand why those who study Buddhism in China do not have a single thing to repay their kindness or promote the Dharma, but only seek blessings and longevity, which are inferior blessings. Alas, there is a custom in Burma. Before the rainy season comes, around March and April of the lunar calendar, there is a custom of splashing water. Men and women splash water on each other. After the water-splashing ceremony, they can fall in love freely. Unmarried people can get married freely, and married people can freely change their spouses. But the water splashed is fragrant water and clear water, and bad water cannot be used. Parents cannot interfere, and masters have no right to interfere. The length of this festival is about one week. The biggest splashing is for three days. But even if it is not the water-splashing festival, men and women can divorce freely at any time. However, the biggest change of the year is during the water-splashing festival. According to this, it is the same custom as the Zhou Li's Mid-Spring February Situ, the media officer in charge of gathering unmarried men and women, and the runners are not prohibited. The fourth month of the solar calendar is the second month of our lunar calendar. But I read in the newspaper that Annam (not sure) also has this custom. Because of the water-splashing, there was a big disturbance. During the festival, the streets are full of water-splashing, and people are splashed when they meet, to the point of disturbing order and causing injuries. It is said that the meaning of water-splashing is that because the rainy season is coming, it is a hot season, and everyone must take a shower. They teach each other and it becomes a custom of respect and love.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Green Skirts Visit the Teacher Asking for Characters Diligently; Talented Women Feast in Brothels Speaking Generously of Military Affairs</p>
<p>Luyi's room occupies a quarter of a three-story house, in a厢房 (xiāngfáng, side room) on the east side of the upstairs, plus a large pavilion room in the back. The arrangement of the furniture seems to have changed a bit. The usual way is to turn the xiāngfáng upstairs into a study, and the large pavilion room in the back into a bedroom. In fact, what is called a study is just a study in a brothel. It is called a study, but there is not a single book. Needless to say. The furniture is all rented from furniture shops. There are many furniture shops in Shanghai that rely on brothels for their livelihood. For example, a whole room of redwood furniture costs a certain amount of money to rent per period. There is one bed, several tables, several chairs, etc., forming a set. This set is called a room. When it is time to move at the end of each period, it is moved from this alley to that alley, or from that room to that room. If that kind of furniture became knowledgeable, it would have seen a lot of stupidity in the world with its cold eyes. If it could open its mouth, it could tell all the foolishness of the world. The so-called decoration of a study in a brothel is also the same set from the furniture shop. A redwood kang bed is placed in the center. Although there is also a kang table, it is removed to provide for the needs of guests smoking opium. In addition, there is a redwood eight-immortal table, and a row of armchairs and tea tables along the wall. There is also a desk with drawers. However, when you pull open the drawers of the desk, what is placed inside is the paper ingots and yuanbin burned by the prostitutes at the end of each month. They are folded in stacks there. There are also the rough shoe soles made by the old maids, along with scissors, needles, and thimbles. If you dig further down, there are empty cigarette tins and broken light bulbs. Luyi's newly furnished room naturally has a bit of a new atmosphere. Although all the furniture in the room is rented, she wants to choose the best. At that time, foreign-style furniture was not very popular in Beili (brothels). They thought that Western-style furniture was too expensive. Those spring sofas and chairs are good when they are new. But in less than a period, the place where you sit becomes a pool, and it has long lost its elasticity. There are some skinny friends whose bones have already protruded from their skin. When they sit on that kind of chair with spring circles protruding on the outside, the two bony things collide, which is obviously uncomfortable. It is better to have the kind of Yang Guifei couch that is unique to China. There are also many drawers in foreign tables, but the boards inside often fall off. If you put something in the first drawer, you may find it in the last drawer. Especially the paint on foreign furniture is as delicate as a beauty's skin. If you put something hot on it, it will leave a mark. You have to use eau de toilette to wipe it often. It is a bit unwilling to have people use the effort of serving a young lady to serve foreign furniture.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Financial Gold Market Continues to Show Extraordinary Growth <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Astonishing Record... Forty-Two Taels, Four Mace</p>
<p>Citywide High Winds and Rough Seas: Yesterday, December 10th, the gold market continued its aggressive advance, repeatedly setting new records, even breaking through the 640 tael barrier. People were extremely alarmed, but the turbulent waves were dangerous, rising and falling suddenly, causing great confusion. From a strange peak in the morning, it rapidly retreated at noon, with fluctuations of four or five taels at times. The afternoon's chaotic situation ultimately softened, with a total daily decline of nine taels. Both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates were tight, contracting by one grade. Trading among various firms in the market was highly divergent. In the morning, Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and others bought and then sold. The Dalian gang sold more than usual. The overseas silver market's decline intensified, causing the gold price to open at a high, rising sharply by eight or nine taels, then suddenly reaching an astonishingly high price of 642 taels and four mace. Afterwards, it was unpredictable, with endless changes. Near noon, it suddenly plunged six or seven taels. In the afternoon, the Dalian gang continued to sell incessantly, while Chengfeng, Yongyongheng, and others bought in, but the situation remained hesitant, with a fluctuation of one or two taels. However, there was no market for foreign exchange due to Wednesday, and later it was calculated to be outside of 634 taels. Starting from Thursday of last week, it reached a high point, and as of yesterday, it had risen by a huge 35 or 36 taels.</p>
<p>Special Changes in the Morning: Yesterday morning, the opening price for January rose by five and a half taels, calculated at 639 taels (the gross price ranged from 37 or 38 to 40 taels, with active buyers. Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yong, etc., all took action). The silver price for large silver bars continued to fall by sixteen and three-eighths, falling by one cent. However, the Nikkei and the U.S. market rebounded by a small sixteen and one-eighth, but Citibank's selling pressure remained strong, so the market was weak. Private telegrams also went down by a small cent. Therefore, people's minds were extremely high. After a fluctuation of one tael, Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yongbingxing, and Wupin suddenly bought aggressively, suddenly breaking through the 40 tael barrier. Exchange rates also strengthened. Shanghai and HSBC mutually conducted transactions in December English gold at 15625. Huabi bought March at 6875 and absorbed December at 5625, and it rose to the first price of 42 taels and four mace since the start of trade. Afterwards, Yuanheng, Yuancheng, Yongwanxing, Shunli, and others tended to sell, immediately going downstream and falling sharply. It fell five taels to 37 and a half taels and then increased to 39 taels and three or four mace. The government bulletin had already announced a reduction of 25 U.S. cents and five dimes, and the Nikkei gold was increased by 1.75 cents. However, the market situation was flat, in fact because there was too much buying, and the internal market government bulletin seemed to be leveling off. Mitsui sold March at 15625, and Huabi bought 75. Around 9:30, it was 38 to 8 and a half taels. Yuanmao, Yongheng, and others sold, and it had already fallen to 35 taels and five mace. Afterwards, it seemed to turn upwards. British American Tobacco entered into December English gold transactions, calculated at 15625. Then, Chosen Seikin sold March at 156875, which was a gold industry dig in. However, the gold price sometimes had a two or three tael plate head, from 37 taels to 39 taels. After 10:30, it suddenly trended to a peak, and again crossed the 40 tael mark. Banks did December 15625, and Mitsui bought December Citibank at 35 yuan and 75 cents. It was also heard that Chase Bank had dropped in cash, a very large amount, estimated to be more than 3,000 taels, so people's minds suddenly became sharp, and the price rose sharply by five taels. At 10:20, it was calculated to be 41 taels and eight mace. Zhifeng, Yonghongxing, and Yong were quite active in dragging in, but the sellers were still non-stop. Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, and Chengyong still bravely disposed of their holdings, and the wind and waves greatly flourished, and it quickly turned to a lower peak, plunging seven taels. At noon, it suddenly became 34 taels and five mace, making it difficult for people to cope. When the noon session closed at 36 taels, it fell another four or five mace. The posted price had been changed to 677 taels and two mace because the Nikkei gold was hanging high at 1.75 cents. It was calculated to be around 40 taels to 35 or 36 taels. At noon, it was 41 or 42 taels.</p>
<p>The After-Market Fluctuations Were Slightly Smoother: The after-market opened at 35 taels and one mace. Yuanheng, Shunli, Wanxing, and others all had sales, immediately falling to 34 taels. It was also heard that the Indian exchange rate had fallen by a small nine annas, and then added one and a half taels, calculated at 35 and a half taels. Afterwards, Yongfeng and Yuanyongxing sold, and then fell two taels, calculated at 33 and a half taels. After 2:10, it suddenly showed a sharp appearance, and the sellers stopped. Retail customers entered the market to buy, so it added more than one tael. Taikangrun, Taifengcheng, Yongheng, etc., also entered. Until 3:30, it was falsely stated as 37 taels. Jindayonglai sold, and then depreciated by more than one tael, calculated at 35 and a half taels. After 3:30, the trend stabilized, with only a few cents of fluctuation, turning around the disk inside and outside of 36 taels. In the end, Taiheng and the Dalian gang sold, and the momentary discharge was one or two taels of money. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 34 taels and five mace, but it was still up one tael compared to the previous day. Afterwards, it was done again to four taels, two or three mace to five taels of scenery. The maximum price for the day was 42 taels and four mace, and the minimum price was 33 taels and five mace, a difference of eight taels and nine mace. The price of goods priced at 42 taels was 39 taels and five in the early market, five taels and four in the noon session, and four taels and eight in the afternoon session. The market closed at four taels and six mace. The registered accounts were 39 taels and 36 taels, and the water replenishment was 39 taels and 38 taels.</p>
<p>Various Firms' Inflows and Outflows Were Chaotic: Among the same industry, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Taiheng Yuan had more outflows than inflows. Zhifeng, Yongyongfeng, and Yuanyongxing went in and out again. Wanxing and Yongfengcheng both went out. Taichang, Bingxing, Xinhang, and Yuancheng Yong all came in. Shunli, Dadecheng, Wupin, Yu Da, and Senchang Yong had very busy inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Chengfengyong and Yongheng Zhifengyong all came in. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuanheng, Taikangrun, Taihengyuan, Yuanyongxing, and Huiyuan all went out. The Dalian gang sold more than 5,000 bars in total, and entered 2,500 bars. The Guang gang bought a small number.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market shrank sharply, and the exchange rates such as English and American slightly increased, while the Japanese and American exchange rates decreased, and the European market was quite weak, because the United States still had the intention to sell. However, the Kobe Nikkei American exchange rate rose slightly. HSBC's listing prices for all exchanges had shrunk by one grade, which was the influence of the silver market.

The American gold each bank did 200,000 yuan, and the Chinese merchants also sold 100,000 yuan, but there were few Japanese gold transactions, and the market was still in a sharp and beautiful stage. It is said that the silver market may be slightly lower again.</p>

<p>The Difference Between Spot and Forward Rates Widens to 0.1875</p>
<p>American Silver Spot Price Plunges One Cent</p>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegraph, the price of Large Bars (Silver) continued to plummet drastically. Both Chinese and American parties slightly sold, but the supply was not plentiful. After closing, the market was very soft. America intends to sell again, potentially driving the price down further, as it recently fell by 0.1875 to 15.5 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling, 6 pence, and 0.375). The forward rate also decreased by 0.1875, reaching 15.4375 pence.

<h3 id="e123">Silver Dollar Market Remains Sluggish <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the silver dollar market remained consistently relaxed. Although "Yang Li" (Shanghai Sycee) experienced a slight increase, it no longer carries the special impression it once had. The current fluctuations are merely cyclical. The demand for silver is extremely low, and there is an abundance of collateral. More than half of the large amount of collateral deposits from before are now being redeemed, indicating the abundance of funds. The auxiliary coin situation experienced a reversal yesterday. It is said that there is a large influx of sources from foreign routes, and the market supply and demand has ample funds for circulation, therefore it decreased with the momentum.</p>
<p>"Yang Li" Slightly Increases in Price　The morning market price of "Yang Li" was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, 1 hao, 2 hu, and a half, which is 1 hao, 2 hu, and a half higher than the afternoon market of the previous day. The afternoon market added another layer, reaching 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, and 7 hu and a half. As a result, it was slightly better than the morning market of the previous day by 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. Although the situation did not experience a major drop, it is also difficult to increase rapidly. "Silver Call Loan Rate" was 7 fen in the morning market and 6 fen in the afternoon market. Clearinghouse Banks quotation were without market.</p>
<p>Guangdong Small Coin Reversal　Jiangnan small silver coins still had no transactions in either market, and the prices were the same as the previous day, without any change, calculated as 6 qian, 6 fen, and 2 li. However, Guangdong small silver coins decreased because it was heard that a large amount of cash was gathered from various routes and sent to Shanghai. The market supply and demand had a surplus, so the price decreased. The morning market was 6 qian, 5 fen, and 7 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian, 5 fen, and 7 li and a half. As a result, it dropped sharply by 6 li and a half compared to the previous day. The morning market transaction volume was 95,000 jiao, and the afternoon market was 60,000 jiao. Copper coins also increased by 2,500 wen, reaching 366,000 qian wen.</p>
<p>Very Busy with Clearing at the Expiry　"Silver Loan" was valued at ten days before expiry yesterday. The money shops were busier with clearing. It is estimated that the silver public list clearing reached over 47 million, clearinghouse loans over 5.2 million, remittance from various routes over 1.5 million, and cash collection over 1 million. The bank's clearing was mainly settlement. It is estimated that Chinese merchants settled over 2.9 million, foreign merchants settled over 2.2 to 2.3 million, settlement collection over 4 million, special loans over 2 million, and various goods, remittances, taxes, and miscellaneous collections over 1.01 million. Outgoing warehouse 1.2 million. The Japanese banks collected over 4.5 million from various collections, settled 6-700,000 and outgoing warehouse 300,000. "Foreign Loan" remittances and drafts made 1.795 million in the morning market and 970,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes was 20,000 in the afternoon.

The bank transactions mutually traded 450,000 in the morning market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. The various banks' foreign accounts clearing was over 1.8 million and banknotes in and out were over 2 million. The money shop's foreign public list collection was over 8.4 million, foreign clearinghouse loans was over 2.3 to 2.4 million, the foreign loan call loan were in and out over 1.4 million, the foreign routes source was 3-400,000, and the small shop money transactions were over 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Reasons for the Recent Drastic Changes in the Auxiliary Coin Market Price <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In recent ten days of this month, drastic changes have occurred in the general exchange market. 角洋 (smaller silver coins) have gradually reduced to within 11 jiao, and copper coins are only around 260 coins. The reason is nothing more than the extreme shortage of physical coins. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Now we have learned that there are still situations in the mix. Since Guangjiao (Guangdong 角 coins) were purchased and shipped by the Dalian gang in August and September, there was a period of exhaustion and panic. Later, due to the limited social demand, it was not of great importance. Now that the end of the year is approaching and the need for the coins has increased, while the supply is insufficient, they are competing to raise prices, resulting in the current special phenomenon. In the recent few days, the upward trend has been particularly strong, which has attracted the attention of neighboring ports. In the past two days, they have prepared cash and shipped it to Shanghai to relieve the urgent needs of the Shanghai market. The number is more than hundreds of thousands, purely gathered from Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and the Yangtze River area. Finally, yesterday's market price plummeted. As for the inside story of the continuous and rapid decline of copper coins, it was caused by the purchase and shipment from Hong Kong and Guangdong. It is also heard that Japan is purchasing purple copper raw materials, and some profit-seekers are even daring to melt old copper coins (with dragon patterns) into copper cakes to meet the demand, resulting in an extreme shortage of cash in the market. Currently, this leak has not stopped, and it is feared that the market price of copper coins will inevitably continue to decline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although many types of government bonds were offered on the spot market, the trading volume remained scarce. The futures market was also quite deserted. The sentiment among both the spot and futures market participants was extremely cold. Major investors were watching from the sidelines, and the fluctuations were minimal. The sluggish situation was no different from before. The prices of active bonds that were sold on the market continued to weaken. National Bonds (19) and Customs Bonds (19) spot prices dropped by 1.45 yuan compared to last week. The 1924 Restructuring Bonds and the National Bonds (19) current month futures continued to drop by 0.8 to 0.9 yuan. Other bonds only dropped slightly by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, except for the 1996 Futures, which rose slightly. The total spot market trading volume for the entire day was 13,000 yuan. The futures trading volume was over 2.4 million yuan in the morning and 3.8 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling over 6.2 million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is slightly stable, and the market atmosphere remains flat. However, some are doing long positions due to the bottom. As the end of the year approaches, the accumulation of bottom goods is increasing daily. The trend of 20-count "Five Blessings Shepherd" dead stock is becoming increasingly sluggish. Therefore, Japanese merchants have very low enthusiasm and need to watch 135 taels. There is still no large-scale development of spot yarn. In fact, the conditions in various regions are difficult, and the purchasing power of out-of-town merchants is weak at the end of the year. After a large drop, there may be a period of circling.</p>
<p>The Bourse is Ordinary　The bourse opened in the morning market, and the market situation rose slightly with retail investors buying due to the remaining winds of the previous day. Each rose by 2-3 qian, and the second and third markets were slightly tired. As a result, it rose by 2-3-4 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot sales were less than before, and people's hearts softened again. The buying sentiment in the market was flat. Each dropped by 1-2-3 qian.

<p>The cotton market is flat and tired, but most buyers have strong attitudes and the market position can still be established. However, the world cotton industry is weak, Egyptian cotton has plummeted by 100 points, and there is talk of closing the exchange. The US cotton market is gradually trending downstream, and the situation is difficult to stabilize. The market needs are quiet for spot cotton from various factories, so most people are watching for a fall.</p>
<p>Han Biao Difficult to Improve　The market opened with Han Biao, although US cotton fell, the gold price soared. Part of the purchase market atmosphere did not change. The second and third markets were tired because the Ningbo gang cut off more than 9,000 dan of long positions. It fell by 0.5 to 1 qian. The market opened in the afternoon, and each fell by 2 qian due to bad news. The second and third markets rebounded again. As a result, it only fell by 0.5 to 1 qian.

<h3 id="e129">Grain and Rice Market: North Tired, South Stable <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei　Yesterday, over forty boats arrived at the lower river, and sales were sluggish. The sales of high-quality Northern Japonica rice were still passable, and the market situation was slightly small. The top of the rice was around 13.7 yuan. Ordinary boards have each fallen one or two corners. The market form is softening due to sluggish sales. The sales of thin rice are even flatter, but high-quality goods are quite rare. Therefore, high-quality goods are fixed at a high price and the second is tired. The local indica rice is still stable. Although buyers are very picky, the plate surface is still around 12.5 yuan. The intake of Dujian rice is sporadic in all directions, and the trend is similar to that of indica rice. Not many wharf rice boats arrive, and the situation is very flat. High-quality goods continue to open at 12 yuan. The port changes to the corners on the left. However, special top-quality goods still require 13.3 to 13.4 angles. Yin Yuan is slightly slow and there are slight drops in the medium and secondary grades.　　South Shanghai　Yesterday, about 30 boats arrived from various groups, and the bottom inventory is still thick. Changxi Northern Japonica rice was able to stabilize the market price due to sporadic sales by customers. The top opening is 13.3 yuan. Although the sales of Su Tong Bai Jing rice are weak, the cargo households are mainly selling due to the fact that the surface is still in the middle. The sales of thin early rice in the south are extremely sluggish, and the source is continuous. The buyers are unanimously bearish, so the price is soft on the corner. The indica cargo is still not prosperous, and the sales are not weak. Dujian has rural sales markets, and all prices are stable. The sales of Tongbian arrive are evenly matched and the grades are mediocre. The price of the high opening is 13.2 to 3. The yin yuan is sorted out and improved by each sale, and the price is neither glorious nor dishonorable. The market situation was stable and flat throughout the day.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Flour Market Progresses Rapidly <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, each month still showed a trend of brave and forward momentum. The quotation of foreign wheat was slightly better, but the biggest relationship was the great vibration in the gold market. The exchange rate shrank frequently, causing those who watched the trends abroad to be largely disappointed. The short sellers took advantage of the low price of wheat abroad, so they layer by layer suppressed everything. Now the fixed goods are not cost-effective, and the environment is better than before, so they can only endure the pain and frantically make up for it, borrowing money for settlement. In addition, the factory gradually took in the accumulation of spot goods, and it was not prosperous, so the shouted price of the Green Ship has reached 2 taels, 2 qian, and a half discount. This kind of rebound is no different from the phenomenon that things must return after extremes and that more empty space is bound to exist in surplus. As a result, this month increased by 2 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day. January and February increased by 3 fen, March and April increased by 2 fen and 7.5 li, and May increased by 3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Recent Wheat Soars by One Qian <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, it showed a vigorous and skyrocketing trend. The trend of this month is that it is difficult to say between more and less, and the competition is particularly fierce. It is heard that the short sellers in this month originally accounted for the majority of a small factory, and brokers attached to it also sold a lot. Now, because the margin is expensive and the cost is not in line with foreign orders, they are already disappointed. What is even more important is that due to the National Lunar New Year, the standard for this month is up to the day of Nianri. Those who deliver foreign wheat may be worried that the shipping schedule is wrong and will not be able to arrive as scheduled, so the only way is to engage in hedging. Therefore, the excitement of people's hearts is extraordinary. The highest board in the afternoon was actually raised to 4 taels, 3 qian, and 4 fen, which is a huge surge of 3 qian and 4 fen compared to the lowest board last week. It can be seen that after prices fall too much, there will inevitably be a huge rebound. The result for the whole day was that this month soared by a huge one qian compared to the previous day. January to April all rose by 7 fen, May rose by 8 fen, and there was still no opening for spot wheat because the factory's stomach did not move.</p>

<p>Additional Patrol Police Dispatched Yesterday</p>
<p>Strict Precautions Taken in the Concessions</p>
<p>The local military and police agencies received a confidential order stating that the Communist Party will hold the First National Congress of the Soviet Government in Ningbo on December 11th (i.e., today). Representatives from all locations were to meet in Shanghai beforehand and travel to Ningbo separately. Therefore, the defense of Shanghai must be especially strengthened at the specified time. Consequently, in addition to dispatching additional patrol police to busy intersections, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has reportedly instructed all districts to pay close attention (National News Agency).</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the Communist Party's uprising in Guangzhou. The French Concession authorities received a confidential report early on that a large number of reactionary elements plan to divide into four groups and gather at 7:00 AM in Caojiadu Yinghua Li, Pudong Yangshupu, Dapu Bridge in the French Concession, and the Minguo Road area in the Chinese-controlled territory, to demonstrate in Nanjing Road.

<p>Shanghai-Hankou Aviation Still Operating as Usual</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai No. 2 aircraft, scheduled to fly to Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, crashed into the large mast of a sand barge near the dock ten minutes after takeoff. The plane's left wing (mistakenly written as the right wing yesterday) broke, the mast snapped, and the fuselage overturned on the shore. As a result, American pilot Bell, mechanical assistant Bian Fugen, passenger Yin Wenlong, and Russian woman Mrs. Anderfei, a total of four people, died.

The chemical test showed slight internal injuries. He slept soundly for four hours at night. On the morning of the 10th, his complexion was better, the temperature was 99.2, the pulse was 28, and the breathing was 23, so a detailed examination of the whole body was made.

Dr. Cao was formerly at Peking Union Medical College. Pulmonary expert Dr. Kuang Cuie, director of the pediatric hospital's pulmonary department, was also invited to check the lungs.

X-rays had not been taken yet. He said that there was no worry about life. Yang was able to eat milk porridge, but his limbs were sore, and his spirit was not as good as before. The cough was also more severe, and there was still blood in the sputum. The doctor said that it was caused by a concussion to the lungs, and it was okay.</p>
<p>Examination of the Bodies: Four male and female corpses, including Yin Wenlong, Bian Fugen, American pilot Bell, and Russian woman Mrs. Anderfei, were carried into the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road by the police. Except for Bell, who was of American nationality and should be reported to the U.S. Assessor's Office in Shanghai to send an inspector to examine and order the burial, although Mrs. Anderfei in the remaining three corpses was of Russian nationality, Russia has abolished consular jurisdiction, so she should be examined by our country's judicial organs together with the corpses of Yin and Bian. Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court immediately sent Prosecutor Guo Huaipu, along with a forensic doctor and a clerk, to the office upon receiving the report. First, forensic doctor Wei examined Bian Fugen's body according to law. Then Bian Rengen, the deceased's younger brother, filed a case, claiming that the deceased was his biological brother and was only twenty-three years old. He was not at the scene when the plane crashed, and only heard the bad news in the evening. He requested to be exempted from autopsy. Prosecutor Guo approved the request, ordered Bian Rengen to sign a guarantee, and took the body for burial. Then the Russian woman's body was examined, but her family members were not in Shanghai. A friend of the same nationality, Mo Yingji, came to the case and requested to take the body. According to him, the deceased opened a tailoring shop in Hankou and came to Shanghai a few days ago for business affairs. She took the plane back to Hankou yesterday, which led to the disaster. Prosecutor Guo also instructed Mo Yingji to sign a guarantee and coffin the body. Finally, Yin Wenlong's remains were examined, and Yin Wenlin, the elder brother of the corpse, came to the case and requested. The judge approved the request to have him sign the guarantee and take the body away.</p>
<p>Pilot's Funeral: After the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai No. 2 aircraft, the tragic death of pilot Bell will be held at the American Funeral Home at 3:00 PM today. Then the President McKinley will transport the remains back to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in the United States for burial. It is also heard that he will be buried in front of the Lafayette General's memorial tombstone. It is heard that most of the veterans of the European War in this city will go to the funeral at that time, because Bell is also one of the veteran aviators. According to Bell, he was thirty-six years old and served in the United States Aviation Service during the European War, and he had a great reputation at that time. Bell joined the Lafayette Air Force in February 1917 and shot down nine German aircraft, making him one of the four outstanding talents of the team and an indispensable talent in the American aviation industry. On May 22, 1918, Bell was shot and wounded and captured by the Germans. He was not freed until the end of the Great War. The U.S. government awarded Bell a first-class medal in view of his great achievements, and the French government also awarded him a medal. The Lafayette Air Force's record mentions Bell's life a lot. The following is an excerpt: "Bell was captured by the Germans, and our team suffered a great loss. Bell's perseverance and spirit are beyond the reach of ordinary people. He went deep into the enemy's territory to scout the enemy's situation, and he never retreated despite the dangers. His driving skills, concealment, tolerance, and hard work are admirable and give our army great benefits." After the Great War, Bell joined commercial aviation and served as a driver for Ford Airlines, a technician inspector for the Aviation Department of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and a chief of operations for Chicago General Aviation. He then joined China National Aviation Corporation as a pilot. Bell had a flying record of 3,500 hours during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Preferential Compensation: As for Yin Wenlong's corpse, it was temporarily buried at the Universal Funeral Home yesterday. His Shanghai residence has only one grandmother. After Yin's mother and wife arrive from Hankou, the funeral will be officially held. The body of the mechanical assistant Bian Fugen was also buried yesterday. His parents and wife in Wuxi have all arrived in Shanghai. The airline will fully bear the funeral expenses of Bian and the American pilot. According to Nie Kaiyi, the airline plans to give special preferential treatment in the future. The amount can be determined after the board of directors approves it.</p>
<p>Cause of the Accident: According to the Great American Evening News, according to Chen, the mechanical assistant of China National Aviation Corporation, the reason for the plane crash was actually due to the flight being too low, the turning was too fast, and the weight carried was relatively heavy. Chen also said that the reason why the pilot of the Shanghai No. 2 aircraft in distress could not fly high was because the mail loaded was quite heavy, and there were five passengers in addition. After the plane collided with the mast, the left wing of the plane broke and the fuselage lost its balance, causing a major disaster. Report to Wang: The reporter of this newspaper interviewed Nie Kaiyi and important officials of the company yesterday. According to them, the company sent officials to Beijing the night before yesterday to meet with Chairman Wang Boqun and report the details in detail. In short, this matter was a sudden event, and both parties were extremely unfortunate, and it was even more unfortunate for the fledgling Chinese aviation industry. From now on, the company will be more cautious and hopes for public support so that the aviation industry will become more developed. Regular Flights: At 8:00 AM yesterday, the Shanghai-Hankou route of China National Aviation Corporation was still operating as usual. The plane was Hankou No. 4, driven by American pilot Costed. The passengers on board in Shanghai were Mrs. Gao Jianlong (Chinese), Count Ciano, the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, and Mai Duoli, the Italian Commercial Attaché. Gao was stationed in Hankou, and the Italian Consul and others went to Beijing to meet with Finance Minister Song Ziwen to discuss important matters. Regular flights will continue in the future. It is heard that all six seats have been booked for today.</p>
<p>Yin and Others' Luggage: The luggage of the Russian woman and Yin Wenlong and others, which was left in the crashed plane at that time, included two suitcases of the Russian woman and one of Yin. They were not taken away in a hurry. Yesterday, they inquired with the airline. It was heard that the luggage was hastily combined with Xiong's luggage by Xiong's guard team. Jiang Yi, director of the Command Headquarters' adjutant office, has been asked to investigate. After it is found, the company will take it back and transfer it to the families.</p>
<p>Crew Not Arrested: Yesterday's English evening newspaper reported that the sand barge that collided with the plane had been detained by the Garrison Headquarters, along with four crew members. However, last night, the reporter of this newspaper interviewed an important official of the Command Headquarters, who formally denied it, saying, "The plane hit the mast, what does it have to do with the crew of the sand barge? Arresting the crew is an unreasonable act in the world. According to common practice, if the main mast is broken by a plane crash, the airline should be asked for compensation." News This Morning: At about 1:00 AM this morning, Dr. Niu went to the Orthopedic Hospital again for examination. Commander Xiong's condition has not changed, but his guard Zeng Chunfan showed a dangerous phenomenon.

<h3 id="e138">Business Representatives Persuaded Minister Kong Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>National Government Orders Retention</p>
<p>After Kong Xiangxi, the newly appointed Minister of Industry, was clearly appointed by the National Government, he firmly requested to resign and came to Shanghai last week to rest. The news obtained yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Talks of Resignation: Because the National News Agency has reported Kong's resignation news for several days, the reporter drove to Kong's residence on West Ames Road yesterday for an interview. Mr. Kong was out, and a secretary received him and answered the following: (Reporter asked) Minister Kong is in charge of industry and commerce, and public opinion is enthusiastic. This time, he was reappointed as Minister of Industry. The business community is deeply grateful. Why did he suddenly become passive? (Answer) Kong's reasons for resigning have been detailed in the letter of resignation, and you have already read it. Now I will tell you what I know. Kong has been running around for national affairs for many years and has been exhausted. He has always had a strong sense of responsibility and is courageous in doing things. He must carefully examine the affairs of the department, no matter how big or small. As a result, he suffered from overwork and illness. He was admitted to the hospital for treatment in the summer of this year for more than two months, but he has not recovered. The doctor strongly urged him to take a few months of rest in order to fully recover and avoid recurrence. The military affairs have just been settled, and all political affairs are urgently waiting for proper planning and aftermath. The Fourth Plenary Session is of great importance, and he has to attend with illness in order to make a contribution. Now that the unification has just been completed, and the central government is trying to refresh its political power, the central government is recruiting talents from all parties to seek governance with great enthusiasm. Therefore, the resignation letter stated that the section of avoiding position and giving way to the virtuous is sincere. (Question) Shanxi fellow villagers in various places have repeatedly telegraphed the National Government to appoint Kong as the chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government. Kong is an advanced revolutionary in Shanxi Province. At this time when Shanxi is dilapidated, does he also intend to return to Shanxi to preside over provincial affairs? (Answer) Shanxi has been under the rule of Yan Xishan for nineteen years. It is heard that the forces in the province are divided into north and south factions. Kong is a central figure with a kind personality and a strict attitude. He has done his best to create social undertakings and has achieved remarkable results. He has always been impartial to all factions and has a happy relationship with all of them. The factions and local people are very fond of Kong. Therefore, after Yan left Shanxi, the people of Shanxi sent letters and telegrams and sent representatives to urge him to return to Shanxi to preside over the provincial situation. Zhao Daiwen and others also telegraphed Kong to ask him to return to Shanxi and maintain the Shanxi situation to the end in order to save his hometown and stabilize the northwest. However, Kong believes that his body has not recovered and still needs to be rested, and Shanxi has just been destroyed. The position of chairman of the provincial government cannot be done by anyone who is talented, both civil and military, and has extraordinary energy. The position of Minister of Industry has been repeatedly resigned, and he is willing to assist the government in the capacity of a Central Committee member in the construction of everything. Therefore, he has politely declined and firmly rejected the good intentions of all parties. At this point, the reporter resigned and left.</p>
<p>National Government Retention Order: After receiving Kong's resignation letter, the National Government immediately ordered to retain him, which is recorded below: The government chooses people for the Ministry of Industry, because the minister has a great body and a keen mind, and he is familiar with the matter, so he is proposed for this position. The times are difficult, so it is difficult to make it difficult for him to seek great salvation. The request to withdraw the order should not be discussed. It should be notified immediately and reported to the Executive Yuan for notification. This order.</p>
<p>Business Community's Retention: After the various commercial organizations in this city heard that Kong had resigned as Minister of Industry, they telegraphed the National Government and the administrative authorities to retain Kong. Yesterday, business leaders in this city, Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Wang Xiaolai, and Director of the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau Zhao Jinqing, etc., went to Kong's residence together to meet Minister Kong and asked him to consider the difficulties of the business community, follow the public opinion, and take office immediately. Kong replied to Yu and others, saying, "I am really unable to do it due to lack of energy. At this time, the central government is recruiting talents from all parties and is eagerly seeking governance. It is sincere to give way to the virtuous. Thank you for your visit." National Goods Association Urgently Telephoned: Respectfully salute Minister Kong, Ministry of Industry, Nanjing, the two ministries of industry, commerce, agriculture, and mines are merged into the Ministry of Industry, and Your Excellency is specially appointed as Minister, which is very happy. I was planning to send a respectful telegram to congratulate you, but suddenly I heard that you expressed negativity and have submitted a letter to the National Government to request that the order be withdrawn, which is very disturbing. I think that since you have been in charge of industrial and commercial administration, you have spared no effort in promoting national goods. This time, you are again the head of the industry, and I deeply hope that you will be familiar with the matter and expand your grand plan. In addition to directly telephoning the National Government to request retention, I will send a telegram to express my feelings. Please dismiss your intention to resign and take office immediately, and implement the Premier's plan to save the country through industry to maintain the people's livelihood, Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation.</p>

<p>Zhang Fang, the member of the Henan Provincial Government, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Chairman of the Relief Committee, went to Beijing from Bian a few days ago to meet Chairman Jiang to discuss the reorganization of the troops under his command and the request for funds for relief. Because Henan is in a four-war zone, the survivors are suffering from severe disasters, so he came to Shanghai a few days ago to visit various charitable relief organizations and well-known enthusiastic gentlemen and merchants to describe the disaster situation in Henan in detail, hoping that all parties will make great wishes and pay attention to relief.

<h3 id="e143">Silk Factory Industry's Method of Allocating Debt <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Will Be Submitted for Approval and Implementation</p>
<p>The silk factory industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai was on the verge of bankruptcy due to sluggish sales and losses. It was publicly agreed to submit a request to the government to issue 10 million yuan of silk industry public bonds in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai to provide relief. It has been approved by Chairman Jiang and Finance Minister Song, etc., and is being handled by Vice Minister of Finance Zhang. Later, it was feared that there would be malpractices in the proposed method of allocation and amortization, and the representatives selected by the silk factory industry were ordered to carefully review the matter. Representatives from silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai held a meeting on the 3rd of this month. Under the collective discussion, the meeting was still fruitless because of concerns that the proposed method was inappropriate. Later, the representatives decided to recommend Wang Xiaolai to visit Vice Minister Zhang and request that the department instruct a proper method to be followed. It is now known that the government has agreed to issue the silk industry relief public bonds, because white silk is related to international trade and should be rescued. However, the problem of allocation and amortization, in addition to amortizing the debt principal, is still based on the previous agreement that 20 taels of silver will be withdrawn for each silk load at the time of export, and the deadline and other items are based on the outline of the previous agreement. The level of distribution of debt is very problematic, and the representatives have repeatedly discussed it meticulously, but there is a lack of a proper method. Generally, according to the number of vehicles, it is necessary to wait for each factory to throw out a package of seasonal silk and receive a public bond of 200 yuan, and so on, in order to prevent abuses and confusions. The opinions and revised distribution methods are now being prepared and submitted to Vice Minister of Finance Zhang for approval and implementation. Judging from this, the issuance of silk industry relief public bonds will not be far away.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Difficulties in Yangtse River Navigation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Shallow Waters...Numerous Bandits</p>
<p>"YiBao" Runs Aground and Escapes Danger: The "Yibin" of the Jiejiang Company, returning to Shanghai from the upper reaches, departed from Yichang. Due to the sharp decline in river water levels, it ran aground downstream of Yichang. It was first stranded due to shallow water, and then some screws fell off the machinery. After sailing out of the shallows, it encountered two more groundings. The ship telegraphed Yichang for assistance and a vessel was dispatched to the accident site to pull it out of the dangerous shoal. Meanwhile, the loose screws were repaired, and it set sail for Shanghai. The ship will be inspected in Shanghai before resuming service.</p>
<p>"Yu Shun" Already Freed From Shoal: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Yu Shun" ran aground on the Yangtze River in Hankou, as reported yesterday. It is now learned that yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, after several lighters cleared the cargo from each hold, reducing the draft, the ship floated. Then, a small tugboat towed it. The Shanghai office received a telegram from Hankou yesterday afternoon, stating that the "Yu Shun" had been pulled out of the shallows. Whether there is damage still needs to be inspected.</p>
<p>No Warning Signs on the Upper Yangtze: On the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the rise and fall of sandbars vary, making navigation very difficult. Traditionally, customs officials in each area would send river patrol officers to measure and verify the river conditions at any time and then announce any changes to hidden reefs and sandbars, either by posting notices, placing red lights, or setting up warning markers, so that ships sailing up and down the river could avoid them. Since the Yuezhou customs officials were kidnapped by bandits while surveying the river this year, no one has dared to go to measure and verify the changes in reefs and shoals from Xindi to Jianli and Shishou, upstream of Hankou. As there have been no warning markers for a long time, since the water level dropped in winter, in just over a week, five or six ships have run aground and encountered bandits due to ignorance of the shoals and reefs.</p>
<p>Two Ships Encounter Bandits on the Yangtze: The Nissin Kisen Kaisha's Yangtze River steamer "Soyang Maru" was sailing downstream from Hankou to Shanghai. While passing between Qizhou and Huangzhou downstream, it was already night. Suddenly, gunfire erupted from the riverbank. The captain, knowing that bandits were planning to attack, immediately ordered full speed ahead and turned off the lights to sail in the dark to avoid being targeted by the bandits. After ten minutes, the bandits were unable to catch up, and they managed to escape. At the same time, the Taikoo's "Ta Tung", following behind downstream, also encountered bandits firing guns at Qizhou. The British soldiers stationed on the "Ta Tung" fired hundreds of rounds from machine guns, and the bandits fled. The passengers on both ships suffered a scare, but fortunately, there were no injuries.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Crew Members Released: Above Xindi, there are the most bandits along the river, specializing in robbing ships, often taking the crew away. After the special tax vessel "Xin Yunnan," which was stranded at Diaoguan, was robbed, the crew and sailors were all kidnapped. Also, two cooks from the Sanbei Dexing, after running aground downstream of Xindi, went ashore to shop and were also kidnapped by bandits. It was heard yesterday that the kidnapped people have all been released. According to those who escaped from the bandits' den, after the bandits kidnap the crew members, they must interrogate the sailors one by one, asking about the shipowner, how the chief mate is, and how they treat the workers. If the sailors say that the shipowner treats people harshly, the bandits will behead the shipowner, the chief mate, etc., and discard their bodies in the river. This has already happened once. According to what the sailors said, all the crew members who were kidnapped were killed. Those who went to the bandits' den, because most of them were from the lower reaches of the river, the bandit leaders did not force them to stay (as for those from the upper reaches who were kidnapped, they had to be forced to join the bandits). Each person was given two yuan for travel expenses and a piece of personal identification to be released to the riverside. The bandits would find a wooden raft going downstream to Hankou on their behalf. There were many checkpoints along the way. Showing the identification card would allow them to pass. People who came out of the bandits' den, along the way, there were restaurants, etc. If the bandits went to eat, they did not have to pay. It was practicing communism. If it was not communism and the released people went to eat, each meal cost 200 cash, regardless of how much they ate. Some people stayed in the bandit den for more than ten days, and some stayed for one or two days.</p>

<p>Service Begins on the 15th of this Month</p>
<p>Sailing Between Shanghai, Xiangshan, and Ninghai</p>
<p>The Donggang Commercial Steamer, founded by legislator Zhuang Songfu and Xiangshan magnate Xiao Boyuan, sailing between Shanghai, Xiangshan, and Ninghai, began service in June of this year. Later, due to minor damage to the ship's machinery, it entered the shipyard for repairs. The company took the opportunity to reorganize and specially hired Zhao Yangfu and Yuan Wanzhen, who are experienced in the shipping industry, as general manager and deputy general manager, respectively, and added capital. The ship's equipment was also thoroughly renovated, and the hull was painted, making it look brand new. All the work has now been completed, and regular service will resume on the 15th of this month. Thereafter, a sailing will be made every five days. The route will still be Shanghai, Daishan, Gaoting, Shenjiamen, Putuo, Baidun, Xizhou, Xianghetan, Heshan, Xueyue, Sijiao, and other ports. In addition, the ship has been formally inspected by the customs after repairs and deemed qualified to resume service.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Xinfeng Case is Transferred to Tianjin for Negotiation <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>In the case of the Japanese ship "Kageyama Maru" colliding with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xinfeng", the responsibility is clear, and all losses should be compensated by the Japanese ship. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a bill for compensation, but the Nippon Yusen Kaisha replied attempting to deny responsibility, only expressing regret and refusing to admit liability. Because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company had obtained the Japanese shipowner's acknowledgment of responsibility and signed evidence, how could they be allowed to quibble? The pilot of the "Xinfeng" at the time of the collision, Bai Lin (who was also the owner of the "Xinfeng" ten years ago), is a strong witness in this case. The Japanese's cunning is not only contrary to justice but also harms the pilot's duty and reputation. Unless the Japanese ship compensates, fairness cannot be shown. The pilot also put forward reasons in his capacity as a witness and pilot, negotiating with Nippon Yusen Kaisha and demanding that they bear the responsibility for the collision. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's shipping department has now transferred the case to Tianjin because there is no branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha in Shanghai, instructing the Tianjin office to negotiate nearby. According to reliable information received yesterday, the Japanese also know that they are at fault and are willing to reasonably compensate for the damaged parts of "Xinfeng", but the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company must order them to recognize and pay the full amount, so the struggle is still ongoing.</p>

Considering the heavy taxation and harassment of tobacco and alcohol, a special meeting was convened to make a resolution. Opinions were drafted and submitted to the Executive Committee, and the association of soy sauce and liquor companies was solicited to jointly petition for the abolition, as recorded below: (1) A letter to the Executive Committee of the Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association states: "Dear Sirs, recently reading the newspaper, we learned that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has resolved to implement the abolition of customs duties and the reorganization of business taxes on January 1, 1931, reducing the burden on merchants. This is a good law and a beautiful intention, and we deeply appreciate it. However, with the establishment of new taxes, the existing similar ones should naturally be eliminated, so as not to burden our merchants again. The two items that are similar to business tax are the tobacco and alcohol monopoly and the tobacco and alcohol licenses. We hereby describe the situation of heavy taxation and harassment in detail below, and we hope that you will consider it. It is found that the taxes have already been paid separately at the place of origin for the merchant who transport the drought tobacco and the earth yellow shao wine, etc. Each time the merchant transport it to the store and sell it, they must pay the monopoly tax, otherwise they will be punished at a multiple of the price. This is a clear proof of the heavy tax, the merchants have been suffering a lot, they dare to be angry but dare not to speak out. The name of the monopoly has the meaning of the business and as to the license, the disturbance is even more serious, (A) when merchants set up a new store, there is no fee for the license to be obtained but the said office must charge an additional $1.20 in the name of handling the registration fee. The Baoshan sub-collection office is even more serious, when the merchants engages in both tobacco and alcohol, $1.20 will be added to each license to be applied. (B) Overdue fees are charged (i.e. expediting fee), the chapter states that the overdue fee for tobacco category A is 8 corners, the overdue fee for tobacco category B is 6 corners, the overdue fee for tobacco category C is 4 corners, and the overdue fee for tobacco category D is 2 corners. The situation for the alcohol category is the same, the tax will be charged additionally from the date of expiry (i.e. the 11th day of the 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th months) to the date of termination (i.e. the end of the 3rd, 6th, 9th, and 12th months), in addition to the payment of the main items, to show a warning. The 4 words (added by month) were added to the said office by themselves, it is permissible to collect an additional 10% of the fee in the first month of each period, an additional 20% in the second month, and an additional 30% in the last month, the said fee are purely pocketed by the contractors. As mentioned above, in the event that big merchants are aware of the tax law, the said office will be flexible to exempt the fee, but for the small merchants who are not knowledge, they will be threatened to not to give up until they achieve their purpose of greed. Under the accumulation of prestige, there is no one to complain, in addition, the staff collects tips in private outside, not to let the people apply for the permit, and the act of favoritism covers up the resistance to the permit etc. Resulting in good merchants being filled with market prices in chaos, the legitimate business of the big merchants are suffering from its difficulties, and with reference to the receipts filled out by the said office to the tobacco and liquor merchants for the license in the past, it is stated (subject to investigation of the business is consistent with the amount of tax, the permit is allowed to be exchanged), which has certainly proved that the license tax is a business tax. Therefore, the reorganization of the business tax will give the former two taxes a cut, so as to achieve real benefits and avoid harsh burdens. Within our knowledge, we will jointly Chen the letter to your association, hoping that this opinion will be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It is the fortune of the entire tobacco and alcohol industry. "The Association of Soy Sauce and Liquor Companies states: "Dear Sirs, in light of the news that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has resolved to implement the abolition of customs duties and the reorganization of business taxes, while the similar are requested to be removed to avoid harsh burdens. Yesterday, we specially drafted a letter of opinion and sent it to the Executive Committee of our association, asking them to review it and forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for approval to the authorities. Now, we are copying the draft and sending it to the cars to draft, and notify our association to jointly present it, in order to receive the effect of joint efforts, still tell to be restored, this to Mr. Zhang Dalian, Chairman of the Shanghai Soy Sauce and Liquor Industry Association, Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association Shanghai South Office Kai 19 · 12 · 10 ·</p>
<h3 id="e156">Foreign Merchants Falsely Accuse National Goods of Being Counterfeit <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yonghe Toothpaste Confiscated by Customs in Rangoon</p>
<p>Cosmetics Association Asks the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Strive for Justice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association received a letter from its member, Yonghe Industrial Company, reporting that its Moon Goddess brand toothpaste, which was being shipped to Rangoon in Southeast Asia, was falsely accused by the American merchant Colgate Company of having a similar trademark, and it reported it to Rangoon Customs, which confiscated the goods. The association believes that this matter concerns foreign merchants falsely accusing national goods of being counterfeit, and it has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to argue for justice based on reason. The original letter states: "Dear Sirs, we have recently received a letter from our member, Yonghe Industrial Company, reporting that the Moon Goddess brand toothpaste manufactured by our company was recently shipped to Rangoon in Southeast Asia and was considered by the American merchant Colgate Company to have the same box paper color as the toothpaste products of the company, and the box did not indicate the words "Made in China", so it reported it to Rangoon Customs, which confiscated the goods, so that the consignee cannot pick it up. Trademark disputes are common, but they must be resolved by the local trademark registration agency or the relevant government agency in accordance with the law, and cannot be confiscated based on the opinions of one party. The toothpaste box of our company uses the Moon Goddess trademark, which is completely different from the toothpaste trademark of Colgate Company, and there are Chinese instructions in Western Shanghar, and the words "Made by Yonghe Industrial Company", so the American merchant said that it did not indicate the words "Made in China", which is obviously inconsistent, other text arrangements, color distribution, are also not similar, how can it be regarded as the same, and the customs confiscated it. We have always admired your association and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for promoting and maintaining overseas trade with all our strength. Our company has been interfered with by American merchants this time, and the business has suffered a great loss. We implore you to write to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forward it to the Chinese Consulate in Rangoon, and to argue with the customs in accordance with the law, and to release the confiscated toothpaste immediately." The association is based on the fact that the Moon Goddess brand toothpaste trademark produced by Yonghe Industrial Company is different in shape from the toothpaste trademark produced by the American merchant Colgate Company, and the products of Yonghe Industrial Company are marked with "Made by Yonghe Industrial Company" and "Using this Moon Goddess brand toothpaste to wipe the teeth can remove the dirt from the teeth and make the teeth white, and it will prevent erosion, pain, and falling off, and it will be firm until old." Like this, the American merchant Colgate Company considered it to be similar and suddenly asked Rangoon Customs to confiscate the goods, which is intentionally hindering our country's overseas trade. We are sending this letter to you to ask the responsible party to uphold the purpose of maintaining overseas trade and to telegraph the Chinese Consulate and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Rangoon to argue for justice in accordance with the law and to release the confiscated goods in full to protect commercial rights and maintain commercial transportation. Yours truly, Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association, December 10, 1919 of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Seamen's Union Asks the Government to Seriously Negotiate the Tao Agui Case <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Tao Agui, a Chinese worker who refueled the Asbeck wheel of the Dutch Rudder Rossetti Shipping Company, fell and injured his knee while on duty, resulting in disability. The Dutch shipowner and insurance company attempted to deny the pension and falsely accused Agui of having venereal disease. The Seamen's Union sent someone to lead Tao Agui to a German doctor for diagnosis, and the result was that he was indeed injured and had no poison. The Seamen's Union telegraphed the situation of the diagnosis to the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan yesterday, asking for serious negotiations immediately. The original text is recorded as follows: (1) To the National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan, it is requested that Tao Agui be re-verified to be injured and non-toxic, and the evidence provided is respectful, and it is hoped that it will be reviewed and transferred to the negotiation. In addition to the original text being in the volume to avoid redundancy, now that Tao Agui has returned to China, it is possible to find a doctor in Shanghai to re-check, and specially telegraph it to inform the company. Zunji transferred and instructed Tao Agui to come to Shanghai from his original home in Taizhou, and sent his Western Secretary Li Zuyou to the clinic of German doctor Yin Lundeng for examination and X-ray examination. The upper and lower separation of the broken knee bone can only be buckled with a medicinal thread, which is extremely unstable, and of course it will become disabled, and the medicinal thread does not have black spots attached, which is sufficient to prove that it is not caused by other residual toxins that caused the injury to not heal. The above situation has been filled out by the doctor for certification when and a paper copy of the X-ray photo is taken. However, Tao Agui is disabled and his family is extremely poor. If he is ordered to go to the Netherlands to sue, the use of waste is difficult to do, and it is impossible. The union hereby proposes to request your ministry to transfer and instruct the Chinese consul in the Netherlands to seriously negotiate the Dutch merchants based on the circumstances and evidence. They will not be able to shirk their responsibility. Now, we are sending the Tao Agui who has been re-examined to be injured and non-toxic, together with the certificate and the X-ray photographs, to be submitted to your ministry, and we beg you to check and quickly order the Consul in Amsterdam to seriously negotiate the evidence, and strive to issue the pension to Tao Agui as usual, so as to avoid injustice and to care for the injured worker. What should be done is still waiting for instructions to follow. This is to the National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Executive Yuan, and a certificate and photo of Tao Agui and a photo of the injured place are submitted. (2) A letter of condolence to the injured seaman Tao Agui, the certificate of the German doctor's verification of the knee injury is non-toxic and the X-ray photos are sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the Consul in Amsterdam for serious negotiation and the issuance of pensions. Now send two copies of the original negative, and ask for instructions before proceeding accordingly. This is to Comrade Tao Agui, the Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Association.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Indians Display Fierce Arrogance <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>A Scene of a Ferocious Drama on a German Ship</p>
<p>Indians Rob Money and Commit Murder</p>
<p>Wang Ada Has No Grievances to Clear</p>
<p>The British Consulate Protects in Bad Faith</p>
<p>Wang Ada, the owner of the Wang Longji Leather Shoe Store in this port, delivered leather shoes to the Fulda merchant ship, the manager of the German firm Meisitzer, which was moored at the Customs No. 12 Buoy in the Hongkou Port, at 5:30 PM on the 7th of this month to collect from the buyer. After the matter was completed, he walked out of the office of the master steward at 7:30 PM. Unexpectedly, Namrozee Khan, an Indian watchman hired by the firm, suddenly blocked his way and demanded compensation (commonly known as drinking money) of two yuan. Wang believed that he was engaged in legitimate business, so why should the watchman extort him unreasonably? He told him that he had no money with him, and then left. The Indian followed him. Wang wanted to walk down the ladder at the back of the ship, but the Indian did not allow it and forced Wang to go down the ladder at the front. Wang did not dare to resist. Just as he stepped on the top ladder, the Indian suddenly grabbed Wang's head and neck from behind with both hands, pressed him to the ground, and pressed his head with his knees and his abdomen with one knee. Wang could not breathe. The Indian tore Wang's pockets and the mouth of his pouch, took out three gold pound notes and ten mark notes, put them in his pocket, and then let go. About three minutes later, Wang woke up and shouted for help, but the ship was in the middle of the Huangpu River, and no one heard it. No one on the ship paid attention to it. Wang went to the upper floor to call for help, but no one came out to ask. Wang had no choice but to see that no one was upholding justice, so he went down again, intending to go ashore and return to the store. Unexpectedly, as soon as he went up the handrail, the Indian grabbed Wang's felt hat. Wang refused to accept it and went back up to grab the hat, but was again beaten severely on the head and around the eyes by the Indian. Wang was unable to describe it reasonably for a while and could only endure it and take a boat to shore. That night, he reported to the water patrol station, asking them to investigate the Indian who committed the murder. The head of the patrol station approved the request and went to the British Consulate the next day (i.e., the 8th) to sign out a warrant to arrest the Indian who committed the murder. He also notified the German firm Meisitzer to immediately inform the Indian to surrender himself, otherwise he would board the ship and arrest him. Upon receiving this news, the Indian surrendered himself to the water patrol station at 9:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 9th). After the head of the patrol station interrogated him briefly, he ordered him to be sent to the Central Police Station of the Public Concession for detention overnight. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the head of the patrol station ordered a Western police officer to bring back the Indian who committed the murder and ordered the Chinese detective Wu Rongsheng to bring the plaintiff Wang Ada and the witness Zhu Yulai, the boatman of sampan No. 1030, to the British Consulate to wait for interrogation. He also sent interpreter Gu Caiwen to relay the message. The trial began at 10:00 AM. First, the plaintiff stated the process of the defendant's murder and robbery and presented a doctor's certificate to verify the injury. Then, the witness Zhu Yulai proved that he witnessed the defendant's brutal assault on the plaintiff. According to the defendant's confession, he overturned what the plaintiff had said and refused to admit it. He only claimed that the defendant boarded the ship at about 8:00 PM, and because the time for idlers to board the ship had passed, he prevented the plaintiff from boarding the ship, which led to a quarrel. He completely denied the two incidents of assault and robbery and accused the plaintiff of fabricating them. According to the testimony of the Indian head of the watchmen, it was the same as the defendant's. At 12:00 noon, the trial had not yet been concluded. At 2:00 PM, the questioning officer continued to interrogate the plaintiff and the defendant. After the debate, the questioning officer announced the verdict at 2:15 PM that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff's accusations and the defendant was acquitted. The reason was that the plaintiff's eyes were swollen and bruised from the beating and his pockets were torn, and he did not report it to the patrol station until the next day. Ada was unable to defend himself at this point and could only shout for injustice and come out.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Provincial Party Department Investigators Arrest Communists <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>For failing to notify the police precinct first,</p>
<p>Qu Yousheng accused them of extortion.</p>
<p>After investigation, they were declared not guilty.</p>
<p>Qu had previously committed robbery.</p>
<p>Fang Guozhen of Jiangyin, an investigator from the Organization Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, recently reported to the Provincial Party Department that Qu Yousheng of Qingjiang, an internal medicine doctor residing at No. 846 Maigen Lane, Maigen Road, Shanghai Public Concession, was a Communist. Therefore, he reported it. The Provincial Party Department immediately informed the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, which in turn informed the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting to jointly apprehend and punish him with the concession police. Director Yuan then sent a letter to the Special District Local Court to issue an arrest warrant. However, before the warrant was issued to the police, Fang Guozhen, together with his men Gao Xitang, Du Jiazhen, Yang Zibao, Shen Sandu, and Mao Fengying, directly knocked on Qu's door at 6:15 AM the other morning and broke in. They dragged Qu to a small teahouse at No. 802 nearby and made demands. Qu's wife, Mrs. Zhang, after her husband was dragged out by the crowd and not returning by 11:00 AM, went to the Gordon Road Police Precinct to report Fang and others for extortion. The police chief then ordered detectives to take Fang and the six others, including Qu, to the police precinct for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special Court, where Judge Wu interrogated them. The police lawyer, Tu Yaotang, stated that the defendants were being prosecuted for two crimes: obstructing the freedom of others under Article 316 of the Criminal Code and extortion under Article 370. He also described the defendants' actions at the time, stating that Fang led the crowd into Qu's house and said to Qu, "You are suspected of being a reactionary, and the court has now issued a warrant. If you can pay 100 yuan, you may be able to avoid arrest." Qu only gave them ten yuan and was dragged to a small teahouse for negotiation. Later, the police received a report and went to arrest them. Subsequently, Mr. and Mrs. Qu explained the situation, questioning Fang's statement. Fang confessed that he had known Qu for a long time and knew that he was a Communist, so he reported him. At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, he went to Qu's house alone to observe his movements and invited Qu to the small teahouse, ordering his assistants to guard him. He then went to the Public Security Bureau to report. He only did not understand the concession regulations and did not notify the police precinct first, and did not extort him. The other five people all said that they were helping because Fang asked them to, and they knew nothing else. After questioning, Judge Wu immediately ruled that Fang Guozhen and the other six were not guilty. Within the appeal period, they each paid a surety to be available when summoned. Qu Yousheng was reported to have Communist suspicions, and the court had issued a warrant. Therefore, the police immediately detained Qu. However, after investigation, it was found that Qu was indeed not a good person. Years ago, he was sentenced to six months in prison by the former Mixed Court for theft and was expelled from the concession after serving his sentence. After Judge Wu concluded the case against Fang and others, he continued to bring Qu to court for trial. The police lawyer did not recognize Qu as a resident of the concession because he had been expelled from the concession before and had no objections to the Public Security Bureau's transfer. Judge Wu then questioned Qu and ordered the officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to take him away for verification.</p>

<p>The bandits Yang Zhengting and others, at noon on the 24th of last month, broke into Gong Yuankui's house at No. 487 Pingliang Road with weapons. After robbing the property, they kidnapped Gong's two-year-old son, Ruxin, and forcibly fostered him in a friend's home. The police were notified, and the case was solved. After investigation by the Special District Local Court, it was confirmed that Yang Zhengting, Li Keming, Li Xin, and Lu Fucai had jointly kidnapped for ransom. They were each sentenced to death.

<h3 id="e162">Tide Rises, Boat Sinks <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Linfa's boat from Songjiang</p>
<p>Zhang Linfa, a Songjiang boatman selling rice, recently collected 140 shi of new rice in the Zhangyan area and transported it to Shanghai, entrusting it to the rice merchant Qian to sell on consignment. The boat sailed to Shanghai the other day and berthed at the special wharf for rice merchants in Xuejia浜. At that time, the tide was low, and the boat was moored below the wharf. Zhang left the boat and went ashore, leaving only two crew members to guard the boat. However, at noon the other day, when the tide rose sharply, the boat gradually floated up. However, when the tide rose enough, the boat was blocked and stuck under the wharf and could not float, causing it to be flooded by the tide. The crew members guarding the boat saw this and tried to push the boat away from the wharf, but it was too late. The boat sank, and the two crew members also fell into the water. Fortunately, it was daytime, and they were not drowned. They were rescued by neighboring boats. When the tide receded, Zhang tried to raise the boat. Much of the rice in the boat floated away, and the rice in the boat was all wet. The oars, poles, and boat equipment also floated away. Zhang immediately reported to the rice merchant Qian, who sold the wet rice on the boat to the sugar factory for cooking sugar for only four yuan and a few cents per stone. The losses were estimated to be very large.</p>
<p>Zhang San's boat from Jiangbei</p>
<p>Zhang San, a boatman from Jiangbei, recently transported firewood from Jiangbei to Shanghai to sell through a firm. He arrived in Shanghai the afternoon before yesterday and berthed on the south side of the Datong Wharf in the South City. At 12:00 PM, the Zhengzhou steamer of the Haizhou class of the United Company entered the port and berthed next to the Datong Wharf. At that time, the tide was rising rapidly, and it crashed into Zhang's boat's bow with the current, shattering it. The tide flooded in, and the boat sank. Zhang and the crew members were all sleeping in the stern. When they saw the water flooding the cabin, they ran out and shouted for help. Because it was late at night, there were no boats to rescue them. Fortunately, Zhang and others were familiar with the water and floated to the shore, where they were rescued by a boat. Only the hull of Zhang's boat remained, floating on the water. All the firewood in the boat floated away. Zhang is now negotiating with the shipping company to claim compensation for the losses.</p>

<p>Dispute Among Night School Organizers</p>
<p>Chen Tingxun of the Meilun English Night School accused Chen Yongchuan of the nearby New New Voluntary Night School of inviting a certain Westerner to search students in his school and falsely accusing them of being Communists. He filed a complaint with the Old Gate Police Precinct. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the police precinct brought the defendant Chen Yongchuan to the Special District Court, initially to the First Court, then transferred to the Sixth Court. Judge Luo interrogated him. First, the police precinct stated the main points, saying that according to Chen Tingxun's report, on the evening of the 5th of this month, the defendant came to the school with a Westerner, claiming that the students were discussing and had Communist suspicions, and pointed to the Westerner as a police detective, and named Zhang Ye and Chen Wenyao as witnesses. Next, the witness Zhang Ye testified that when the defendant came with the Westerner that night, he initially searched the students, claiming that they had Communist suspicions. Later, the Westerner searched my bed, which I refused. I also told him that they were discussing matters of the New New Voluntary Night School. The New New advertisement for enrollment said that it was free, but it charged one yuan for half a year, then changed it to one yuan per month. The students felt that the school was changing at will and was close to fraud. The Westerner heard this and said, "This is a matter for the school, I do not want to interfere," and then left. Later, other witnesses were questioned in detail. Further details will be explored later.</p>

<p>The Third District Party Department of this city, according to the report from the Fifteenth District Branch, stated that along the banks of the Suzhou River in the Caojiadu area, broken boats from Jiangbei have been moored for a long time without leaving. Some even drive wooden piles,擱起the boats, and intend to stay for a long time. Among them, men and women are factory workers or peddlers, not boatmen, and occupying the waterfront is already wrong. Moreover, driving piles and long-term mooring slows the river flow, causing siltation over time. Residents along the banks will then encroach on the river beach and build houses because of this. Broken boats will then live by the houses, and after a long time, they will become houses again. The waterway is being eroded day by day, and traffic will be blocked. The department then forwarded the situation to the Municipal Party Department and sent a letter to the Municipal Government to find a way to ban it. Now the department has received a letter from the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Department, saying that according to the Municipal Government's instructions, it has ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to investigate and ban it.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Marital Entanglements of a Female Movie Star <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Song Meiling, a 23-year-old woman from Shaoxing, is currently an actress in the Star Film Company. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, while walking near Zhengjia木橋 Street on Fada Road, she was suddenly surrounded and quarreled with by her fellow townsman Meng Xinyou and others such as Yang Shicai, Yang Chengtang, and Meng Zhishou. Patrol officers from No. 573 arrived and brought the thousand people to the police precinct. According to Meng Xinyou, Song Meiling is the formal wife of a civilian. She came to Shanghai privately last year. The civilian came to Shanghai to look for her and only met her now, so he arrested her and requested permission to take her back. Song Meiling said that she was not promised to the Meng family and was falsely accused because she asked for a loan and started a fight. The police chief ordered Meng and others to be detained and sent to the French Court for investigation. First, the police chief reported the situation, and then the patrol officer from No. 573 said that the patrol officer saw the two parties arguing with each other that night. I immediately stepped forward to ask, and the man accused the woman of being a runaway wife, and the woman accused the man of extortion, so the arrest was true. Song Meiling, represented by Lawyer Bahe, said that our client had never married Meng Xinyou as his wife, nor had she entered into a marriage contract. This was an attempt at extortion and a deliberate false accusation, and requested a trial according to law. Meng Xinyou confessed that Song Meiling was indeed the wife of the civilian and now had a marriage certificate for identification and did not dare to extort. Song Meiling said that although her parents verbally agreed to marry me to Meng Xinyou when I was young, I was young and ignorant at that time. Now that my parents are deceased, I work alone at Star. Meng and others often come to borrow money from me without success and falsely accuse me of being a runaway wife to bring a lawsuit, requesting a trial. Lawyer Bahe also said that in this era of marriage reform, even a verbal marriage contract cannot be regarded as a formal wife, and the accusation is completely unfounded, please review.

At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Jinlong, a detective from the New Gate Police Precinct, and police detectives arrested Cheng. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for interrogation. Police Lawyer Tu stated that all transfer cases should first prove the criminal act according to the agreement and be transferred after the court's investigation confirms it. This case is related to Communism and the Public Security Bureau should submit evidence and send it to the Higher Branch Court for review. Inspector Xia of the Municipal Public Security Bureau presented a document for transfer, stating that the defendant was an important criminal ordered to be arrested by the General Headquarters and had been confessed by accomplices in the headquarters. He should be handed over for transfer immediately. Cheng Yongxi denied being a Communist and hired a lawyer to defend himself, requesting the court to investigate the evidence. After interrogation, Judge Wu ruled that Cheng Yongxi should be handed over to Inspector Xia of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to take away. The police lawyer stated that he did not accept this ruling and would file an appeal. During the appeal period, the defendant should not be transferred and should remain in custody at the police precinct. Judge Wu instructed the defendant to remain in custody at the police precinct because the 工部局 declared in court that it was appealing.</p>

<p>Judge's Mediation Ineffective</p>
<p>Yao A'bao, a woman from Songjiang, recently hired Lawyer Chen Wen to file a lawsuit in the local court against Zhang Zhangsheng for being unbearable to live with. She requested a divorce and asked for 2,400 yuan in alimony. The defendant Zhang Zhangsheng also hired Lawyer Zhou Yu to file a defense. Yesterday morning, Court President Guo Shouyi opened the court for trial. Both parties arrived in court with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff Yao A'bao, 22 years old, from Songjiang, testified that she used to work as a maid at the Cai family on Kangti Road and is now working at No. 534 Defeng 里, Beijing Road. In 1927, I was only 19 years old. In May of that year, I met the defendant and lived together in Shouxian里, Ximen. Later, I had a child. At this time, the defendant explained to me that he still had a wife at home, so I moved back to my home in Xiaonanmen and lived with his wife. On the sixth day of the first month of this year, the child died of illness. The defendant then quarreled with me, so I left in May and returned to my old job, working as a maid to make a living. But I only worked for three months and resigned due to illness. Because I thought that I would have no one to rely on when I was old, I requested to be allowed to divorce and requested to be given ten years of alimony, calculated at 20 yuan per month, totaling 2,400 yuan. I requested a one-time payment. Next, the defendant Zhang Zhangsheng, 47 years old, a carpenter, testified that in 1927, he took the plaintiff as his concubine. After she gave birth last year, he moved her back to his home to live with him. This time, the plaintiff left for no reason, and I do not want to divorce. The examining official said that it would be better to separate from his wife and pay the plaintiff 20 yuan per month for living expenses. The defendant listened and nodded. The examining official asked the plaintiff again, but she insisted on divorce. Therefore, the mediation failed and the debate began. The lawyers of both parties filed lawsuits against each other. The examining official concluded the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 13th of this month.</p>

The defendant, Ye Maoxi (also known as Fengming), is a staff member of Qingjietang and also hired Lawyer Yao Jian to file a defense, stating that his granddaughter Ye Lijuan opposed this marriage and did not obtain her consent. He also accused the plaintiff of having syphilis. The court had opened a trial and ordered both parties to reconcile outside the court. If the reconciliation failed, the defendant would be ordered to pay the expenses and send the plaintiff to the hospital for an examination to determine whether he had syphilis and ordered the defendant to bring his granddaughter Ye Lijuan to court to wait for questioning. All of this has been reported in the previous report. Yesterday morning, Court President Guo Shouyi continued the trial. First, the defendant's lawyer stated that the case had been reconciled outside the court. All the gold jewelry had been returned to the plaintiff. Regarding the loss issue, the defendant only agreed to compensate the plaintiff 10 yuan, while the plaintiff demanded 40 yuan, so it had not been completely resolved. The examining official ordered both the plaintiff and defendant to the case, questioned them briefly, and then made a decision, ordering the defendant to return the gold jewelry and compensate the plaintiff 25 yuan. The engagement was allowed to be terminated. Both parties were satisfied, so the reconciliation was established. Court President Guo then wrote the reconciliation record and ordered both parties and their lawyers to sign and leave the court.</p>

<h3 id="e189">A Review of the Industrial and Commercial Conference and its Hopes (Continued) by Mu Xiangyue <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>At this conference, the various proposals regarding economic construction generally had considerable decisions that were suitable for the current national conditions and sufficient for the government to adopt. However, upon examining the proposals, most of them were based on discussions and lacked numerical indications. The so-called numerical indications refer to a precise statistic of various industries and commerce in the country. This precise statistic should be automatically investigated by various industries nationwide, and the government should only be responsible for compiling and summarizing the results to provide guidance and protection for various industries nationwide. Our country's industries and commerce have never had this kind of work. Even if someone proposes this matter, various industries would keep it a secret. Although there are wise people, they cannot do anything about it. However, they do not know that at this time, industries and commerce should pay attention to domestic trade everywhere and must deeply understand the trends of industries and commerce in various countries to be able to welcome or reject them appropriately. Without precise statistics, the government cannot fulfill its responsibility of guiding and protecting. At this conference, it was clear that many proposals needed precise statistics as the basis for research, but due to a lack of accurate materials, there was no way to start. All the delegates attending this conference had this feeling, but how to handle the investigation and statistics should also be discussed. Now, let's list an item for cotton industry investigation:</p>
<p>(1) Planting location and quantity (2) Quality</p>
<p>(3) Purchase method (4) Transportation situation</p>
<p>(5) Concentration location (6) Various taxes</p>
<p>(7) Export port (8) Accumulated malpractices and elimination methods</p>
<p>(9) Foreign situation (10) Competitive situation</p>
<p>(11) Methods of developing the industry</p>
<p>All of the above investigations should be carried out by people with knowledge and experience in the industry to make a precise statistic. It is especially important to pay attention to the foreign situation and competitive situation. All industries in the country should make every effort to engage in this statistic. For example, in the match industry, all raw materials, such as phosphorus, wood, box manufacturing, and printing paper, whether the raw materials are produced in the country, if there is a considerable amount of production, what are the prices in each producing area, what are the freight taxes, how is the quality compared to imported products, how is the cost compared to imported products, what is the production volume in each place, how many factories are there in each place, and how many sales are there in each place, all must have accurate numbers as the basis for research and development. Our country's industries and commerce have a wide variety of products. According to the group table of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Research Association, they are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Silk Industry Group Cotton Industry Group Rice Industry Group</p>
<p>Timber Industry Group Oil Industry Group Silver Money Industry Group</p>
<p>Exchange Industry Group Iron Industry Group Tea Industry Group</p>
<p>Wool Weaving Industry Group Knitting Industry Group Hemp Industry Group</p>
<p>Paper Industry Group Cigarette Industry Group Match Industry Group</p>
<p>Porcelain Industry Group Coal Group Sugar Industry Group</p>
<p>Brick Tile Lime Industry Group Leather Industry Group Electrical Industry Group</p>
<p>Printing Industry Group Car Manufacturing Industry Group</p>
<p>The above groups only need to select one or two people from the industry to specialize in the investigation business, and then the statistics of each industry will be clearly available. I think that our country's industries and commerce originally have trade associations, so they can seek the development of the industry and gather to discuss matters. The method is excellent. Now, we can expand this method. The various industries can gather the same industries from all over the country to organize a joint association of each industry, hire experts to conduct thorough investigations, which is the simplest and most complete way. In recent years, the Yarn Factory Association has handled statistics with definite results. It is hoped that all industries and commerce in the country will follow suit. After a few years, it will definitely have a great effect. As for the proposals in this conference, such as Mr. Chen Zongcheng's labor investigation statistics, item 3 in Mr. Bian Shousun's relief industry proposal, and the Ministry's industry and commerce visiting bureau requesting the handling of regional investigations of national industry and commerce, all pay attention to industrial statistics. For example, the labor statistics item is already being undertaken by the government, so we can ignore it for now. Mr. Bian and the visiting bureau proposed requesting the government to investigate to promote national production and to conduct regional investigations of national industry and commerce. The planning is very appropriate, but it is still difficult for the government to handle it alone. (1) There is no economic way to handle it, because large-scale investigations cannot be done without setting up bureaus in different regions. At this time of financial constraints, how can this huge amount of funds be raised? (2) There is no way to concentrate talents. Various industries and commerce have their own specialties. The silk industry does not know the way of the sugar industry, and the rice industry does not know the reason of the tea industry. If the government handles it, it will be impossible to concentrate so many talents. (3) The old habits of our country's industries and commerce make it difficult for outsiders to discover the bottom line. Even if someone engages in investigations, non-industry people will find it difficult to get the truth. (4) Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources. The industries and commerce, such as the 23 groups listed above, may not be able to cover all of them. If the government is solely responsible for the investigation, it may lead to omissions, and it will not be possible to complete the task in a short period of time. All of these points should be noted. I think that the national industrial and commercial survey should be the responsibility of each industry, and the government should summarize the results. Therefore, there must first be accurate statistics from each industry's own investigation, and then the government will have a solid basis. The government can find ways to eliminate what is harmful to each industry, and the government can do its best to develop what is beneficial to each industry. Only in this way can the national economic construction proceed step by step to fulfill the mission of the Three Principles of the People. This is the reason why I advocate that national industrial and commercial statistics should be automatically investigated by each industry. It is hoped that the national industrial and commercial circles will rise up and plan for it.</p>
