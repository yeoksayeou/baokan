<h3>整理漢淞間水道方案</h3>
<p>崇文洲爲第一難關　　實施整理從此起點　　擬就地組織工程處</p>
<p>交通部揚子江水道整理委員會所擬漢口吳淞間整理計書草案前　行政院令交通部擬具詳細計畫以便撥欵實施當由交部轉令該會業經委員長蔡培令工務處長宋希尚擬就實施方案提經該會第二十三次常會議决原則通過其内容略以漢淞間容航深度照目前航業需要而言擬以全年通行十五英尺爲標準而阻碍吃水十五英尺之輪船者當以崇文洲爲第一難關援治水始自下游之原則該洲當爲實施整理之起點一俟整理有效然後按次推行以達整理全段之的至崇文洲實施方案大體如下</p>
<p>江流形勢崇文洲在安慶下游五十三公里與鳳鳳洲並立江流分而爲三北泓淤阻後南泓逐漸擴張民國十五年又於其間衝成中泓江面分裂流速銳減去冬南泓匕游亦繼漲新灘深處水深僅三四公尺而已照現在形勢而論中泓徑直故擬規定此泓爲將來航行之正泓</p>
<p>整理方法正泓選擇旣定則整理標準可分爲三（一）迎導江流趨向中泓採用建築工程（二）集合低水時之水最全注中泓採用低水位壩（三）保護江岸不使發生意外坍削採用護岸工程此項設計乃係根據該會數年來之工程實測及掦子江特殊之性質</p>
<p>施工步驟整理十一淤淺之處爲　愼計爲經濟計實有分處施工依次推行之必要即在一處　手其施工步驟亦當酌量情形權其緩急　察其變化隨時應付之蓋治水工程與普通建築工程不同况此項計畫多利用天然水力必使河流有自動改良之機然後因勢而利導之一而在必要時採用挖泥機而爲之助故崇文洲實施工程其步驟可分爲二期第一期（一）建工（二）低水位壩（三）護岸工程第二期（一）建工（二）低水位壩第一期工程實施後深信江流趨入中泓水力必有自動濬深之趨勢至時十五呎吃水之輪全年已可通行無阻則第二期工程不妨察酌形勢從諼進行</p>
<p>工作時間按此項工程實施必須在低水位時方易着手故一年間以夏秋兩季爲備準時間冬春兩季爲施工期間施工期間旣爲水位所限制故準備工作如舉行施工測量及招標購置設備等等必須充分準備一俟開工即以六個月爲期必須將第一期工程完成然後江水漲時在夏秋兩季視其成效及其自動變遷再定第二步工程之進行</p>
<p>組織計畫查治江工程責重事繁在本方案内整理崇文洲一處不過爲實施之起點已需銀五百三十餘萬苟無完善之組織恐難期圓滿之結果故擬就地組織掦子江水道整理會崇文洲工程處指派總工程師主持其事</p>

<p>— 趙鼎銘</p>
<p>世界語係波蘭人柴門哈夫應用科學方法所創造構造簡單易於學習其宗旨爲希望人類間恃一種公用語免除隔膜實現親愛而余加入世界語函授學校之動機即在於是</p>

<h3>聲光偶語</h3>
<p>— 致和</p>
<p>著名滑稽明星卓别林氏攝製有聲影片終已隨時代之潮流而成爲事實雖卓别林素來反對有聲片以爲將减却許多靜默的美然事實上有聲影片之發達終爲電影事業向上之開展卓别林自亦不能不一顧及他日一片告成彼大皮鞋托托之聲將何遜于百老匯之歌樂哉</p>
<p>西方有聲電影有一最大之缺點即偏重于歌舞而復注重影片之情節以致略犯千篇一律之病而終覺其嚼蠟無味卓别林之所以反對有聲片者亦以此故然有聲片而能兼顧情節則繪影繪聲當然更能動人蓋耳目之娛樂與腦筋之剌激相融和而趣味乃深厚矣</p>
<p>國産影片至今猶未見諸事實然此爲一種適應時代之新産物已無可疑聞明星公司方面已别有組織專力進行大部計劃均已就緒而第一片（歌女紅牡新）且已攝製將畢或可於年内出映一新我人之耳目此爲國産新片之新貢獻不能不使我人欣愉然我敢進言於該公司者則所攝之有聲片必求其情節之曲折而不必求其歌舞之繁多頗知（歌女紅牡丹）片爲一悲劇寫一歌女之身世飄零得意失意極爲曲折此外復有京劇大鼓小調新歌曲之穿插亦緊湀亦緊張亦曲折亦熱閙是則該片之成功可不待言矣</p>
<p>（無言之美）爲一般文學家所力稱我師俞平伯君且有長文諭之然而在影片中苟有適善之支配則動靜之間尤使人有身入其境之妙譬如西湖秋夜萬籟俱寂中忽聞鐘聲一杵其雋妙爲何如耶願明星公司努力使國産有聲影片得一兩全其美之成功也</p>

<p>慘劇發生原因招商廣大輪于本月十六日上午八時從上海出口開往廣東乘輪旅客共計七八百人完全爲粤籍係由南京到滬而送歸廣州者在十五日即已上船比至十六號晨開船之先船員檢查各客發見無票乘輪者多名當經船員將未備船票者驅逐上岸及至解纜啓椗船將離埠乃有一搭客在岸上飛奔而至謂係上陸講買點膳者時船已移動該客乃從碼頭上緣江内木椿而扳登上船此際人聲異常嘈雜船上有一茶房見該客緣椿而上疑係被驅逐之無票客人因禁阻其登輪將該客猛推一下轟然一聲該客跌落水中船員忙于開輪手續不遑援救而落水之客竟遭溺斃聞屍體亦未撈得故姓名亦屬不知</p>
<p>船内搭客大閙此事發生後廣大輪照常開行同船旅客中有目覩此事者大爲不平即向船員等交涉未幾全船之人均知衆人謂我等係由廣州同夥來此何故將我們之同志無端推落江内溺斃須責令船主將兇手交出全船人一致鼓吵船内發生極大紛擾船主爲衆包圍無法可想祗得立時停船在吳淞口立即發無綫電到滬請總局迅即派員到輪處置</p>
<p>滬局派員澈查滬局得訊立即命南棧視察處主任劉震等調查此案眞相一面由李總辦派史某赴吳淞向廣大輪中各旅客調處對于茶房打客落水溺斃一事局中准予追究凶手嚴行懲辦對于已經溺斃之客准予打撈屍體並給予撫卹當場由史某向衆担保此兩事决代辦到經此保證衆憤始平而廣大乃得開出</p>
<p>茶房吊打一夜停輪吳淞之際各旅客對于動手推人落水之兇手在船找覓不意誤將在廣大輪中設置小物商店之茶房錯認作爲兇手由衆客將其吊在船内攅毆之該茶房被吊一夜而且全身均被打傷直至十八日晨經局員到輪聲明兇手並非此人但已遍體鱗傷矣</p>
<p>總局責查兇犯李總辦已令廣大業務主任朱杏亭將動手推人落水之正兇交出以便送官究辦茲因船已開出即電致該船船員須將行兇茶房（似名小瞎子）妥爲看守勿令逃逸以便還滬時拘押送辦</p>

<h3>西洋文士筆蹟的市價</h3>
<p>— 鵑兮</p>
<p>一個藝術家或是一個文士他的言行常是令他的景仰者愛聽的他們的筆蹟也爲一般敬服他們的人所珍愛這是一般人對特别有一種才情技能的人自然生出的情感證之東西洋社會心理都是這様在文學藝術與一般民衆生活更接近的西洋那是更不必說了因此文士的筆蹟竟可以在市塲上成一種市價　貨品交易一様自然這貨品的價格是視社會對那文士敬愛的程度而差異的這種風氣曾一度傳到日本去（文藝俱樂部）（雜誌社）曾在本鄉Hogno拍賣各作家的原稿新聞上也曾經載過夏且石漱的書簡和與謝野晶子夫人的短册（詩稿）出賣的消息</p>
<p>這裏且來談談西洋文士筆蹟的市價</p>
<p>文士筆蹟的市價在西洋不消說是帶有史蹟考證性質的是文士筆蹟中市價最高的了像悲多汶的樂譜宗教改革家馬丁路德的請願書互格那歌劇的草稿但這只適宜一般大規模的紀念館收買因爲價格都是很貴的</p>
<p>一般人最感趣味的還是那些和我們長長親灸過來的作家的斷簡零篇因爲這是一般人能力中間能夠賣的像易卜生在他一封八行的信上寫說（昨日是禾門得勒初上演的日子得了非常的喝采我被人請出五次）這東西只標了二十五馬克的價格一封請租房子的信被人用了七十六個馬克買了去最貴的托爾斯泰的（神之國在你中間）的校正稿（有青墨水修改過的痕跡）每四頁也只賣到二百馬克屠格湼夫寫給現代雜誌謝絶原稿約束的德文信只賣三十馬克</p>
<p>不過在這些一般人容易購買的手蹟中間也有比較起來算得是高價的像霍甫特曼只在一張照相上寫了（藝術是宗教一九一三年一月）幾個字這照相就賣了三十六個馬克又他在他自已一八八六年的照相上用鉛筆寫說（劍有鋒錂學校教師有白墨在這……有哈眞海特（地名）霍甫特曼）只是這幾個字賣到一百二十六個馬克他二十四歲時寫給柏林友人的一封信中間說到他家庭與金錢的事這封信出賣了五十個馬克在瑪利亞夫人的名片上寫有六行字這名片只賣了四馬克這算是他所有筆蹟中間最便宜的了</p>
<p>法國作家方面戈括署過名的名片賣過五馬克莫泊桑的却從二十六馬克賣到過三十馬克比較珍貴的弗羅貝爾的書信却只賣到過二十六馬克　俄的信賣過三十馬克市價最高的還是盧騷他寫給鳩立埠市長的信賣到三百五十個馬克别的信甚至有賣到四百二十個馬克的都德的塔爾達林的翻譯原稿一頁價値十馬克范來爾的詩集賣價爲一百二十個馬克愛爾哈蘭三行的信札賣到過十馬克而艶名一世的（喬治桑得）連她的照相一齊却只能賣到二十六個馬克這不能不歎息她的薄命了此外左拉的書信算比較賣得高一頁曾賣到十八馬克到二十六馬克大仲馬的只賣四馬克或十馬克梅特林克的書簡一頁也只賣得到十馬克</p>
<p>英國作家的市價相當賣得高加來爾兩頁的信付上封筒可賣一百馬克狄更司的信他自署的封筒和封臘都注意保存着的可賣五十馬克或八十馬克雷思金的却賣得比較便宜一信只値四馬克或十二馬克白朗寗的曾賣過十馬克</p>
<p>美國詩人即法羅的書信每封賣到過六十馬克馬克多因的賣到過二十六馬克</p>
<p>次還有比較算得是廉價的文士筆蹟是德國詩人得麥爾的校正稿一部只賣二十六馬克書札每封只賣三馬克或八馬克（青春）的作者海爾比的書信一封只賣二馬克</p>
<p>致於帶有參考性質的賣價很貴的東西可記的有席勒爾原稿鄉斷片賣過　百六十馬克弗信爾述說自已境遇的書簡賣過一千五百馬克海湼寫的（搖籃之歌）的一節也同様賣到一千五百馬克席勒金寫的（機織之歌）賣價是二千馬克這算得是筆蹟市塲上是高的價格更有他那遺言書的草稿不上五頁賣到一千二百五十馬克（秋之姿）的四行詩賣到二百馬克給巴黎雜誌社述說自已貧困的信賣價是六百六十馬克他眞算得是筆蹟市塲上的寵兒叉歌德的書简也曾賣到六十馬克</p>
<p>我國還没有看見文士的筆蹟會走進市塲而形成他的市價的過去的傳述曾經記過文士的書畫可以送進質店怕這也只成了留在歷史上的韻事了罷</p>

<h3>宮中的一日</h3>
<p>— 筠</p>
<p>好久没有提筆寫日記了現在提起筆來簡直不知道從那裹說起胡亂地寫寫吧</p>
<p>今天天剛剛亮太陽還没有出來琤琤琮琮的鋼琴聲便從會客室裏隨着微帶寒意的晨風飄進耳鼓來了同房的琪發氣似的說（眞是見鬼）這麽早便叮哩咕嚕的吵起來了你不要睡覺難道呌人家也陪着你不睡覺麽我們這裏又不是什麽皇宮内院要你來奏奏音樂你若是歡喜弄鋼琴愛音樂何以不到中央音樂院去一定要在這來害人呢）</p>
<p>（這眞是見鬼罷）嘉也是這麽說</p>
<p>的確我也是這麽想着</p>
<p>清脆而沈重的起身鐘敲了鐘是一下一下地敲的同時我們宿舍裏囂閙也是一秒一秒的增多東一聲（娘姨）西一聲（娘姨）在走廊上跑來跑去的在樓梯上跑上跑下的都是她們這些篷着頭垢着臉的娘姨們</p>
<p>我眞有點不明白這是什麽意思素稱思想新穎不同凡俗的珍姐自從進了這所謂的（宮）以後便和以前的她完全不同了以前在某女子中學的時候她是最激烈地主張保持自然美反對擦胭脂抺粉和一分矯柔遇作的化裝的可是到了現在却不能抱定主張了環境的同化力眞大啊她和一般所謂的宮主們一様把整天的光陰差不多完全花在擦胭脂抺粉淋香水畫眉毛點嘴唇熨頭髮照鏡子（啊喲我眞該被她們駡是一個時代内落伍者連這些化裝上的名詞都不能記得清楚）上面去了</p>
<p>上午七時到七時三十分照說是預備上　的時間但是她們却把書本仍然擱然在書架上把粉盒胭脂盒香水瓶梳子鏡子……擺滿了一桌子化好了妝又要愁今天穿什麽衣裳了</p>
<p>（筠你說我今天穿什麽衣裳呢）珍姐問我</p>
<p>（何必問我這個不懂時髦的鄉下大姑娘呢你去問時裝大家嘉小姐和婉女士好了）我好久便想出出悶氣發發牢騷的只是没有機會現在這句話說出了之後我的全身好像輕鬆得多了</p>
<p>但是她却呶着嘴一聲也不響地從堆滿了衣裳的床上擇了一件新做的長旗袍氣冲冲地跑出門外去了</p>
<p>不到一分鐘嘉的房門響了一下</p>
<p>上課的預備鐘敲了今天第一小時我没有課所以斜依着窗子看她們上課的情形</p>
<p>珍姐和嘉在一起她們談談笑笑地往简公堂去她們這種裝束没有看慣的人們看來眞要以爲她們是往大華飯店去參加時裝展覽大會不是去上課的</p>
<p>前天父親特地寫掛號信來呌珍姐不要太浪費了把金錢看重一點因爲現在家裏經濟狀况很困難但是她們仍然是這種様子勸她也不中用反而惹起她的脾氣來了（我的事情用不着你來管…想起來眞是氣壞人</p>
<p>今天上午上Modern　English的時候眞把我氣得要命索以能言善辯的交際家自命的琪女士唸書的聲音不但坐在講堂上的開教授聽不着甚至於坐在她的鄰座的我也聽不清楚恐怕她自已也聽不清楚她自已唸的些什麽罷難怪學校裏的壁報要挖空心思來諷刺刻薄了我以前總是駡壁報是無聊的現在我反而覺得牠們是應當刻薄的了自已不爭氣當然應當要給人家刻薄啊</p>
<p>下午一課也没有所以吃了午飯以後休息了一會便跑到圖書館去了政治學的筆記還没有整理好聽說明天便要考眞急壞人</p>
<p>我滿心希望在圖書館裹清清淨淨地做做事那曉得在圖書館裏跟在房間裏一様的不寗靜閱覽室的門不到一分鐘便要（砰）的一下討厭的咳嗽聲互相耳語聲和桌椅移動聲以及進出的（得得）皮鞋聲眞使人心裏感受到極度的不安事情是做不好的了抬起頭來無數可怕的眼光便射過來我眞不敢在圖書館裏逗留半分鐘了於是我趕忙地把東西收拾起來跑回宿舍去了</p>
<p>經過會客室我便想起會客室大有更改名字的必要了一些來（會）的（客）都是一些每天不知要（會）多少次面的（客）人我們的會客室眞不知道呌什麽名字好有時會做吃點心和咖啡的小店有時會做補習課程的課室有時又會做閱覽書報的閱覽室有時更會做男女同學…………………到了晚上我眞怕從了彬院前門和會客室經過因爲這兩箇地方在晚上常會有些我所不敢用眼睛看用耳朶聽的事情發現</p>
<p>在宿舍裏燃燒火爐放置貴重物品在電燈熄滅後點蠟燭及油燈在上課及自修時間唱戲拉琴開留聲機及其他有礙公共寗靜的遊藝在訓育大綱上是有明文規定禁止的但是這一類的事情在這個所謂的（東宮）裏是太多了不知道這是因爲訓育大綱不適用於我們女生宿舍還是因爲我們深閨簡出的女生指導先生不願多惹是非</p>
<p>下午五點鐘蓮從子彬院下了課回來邀我出去吃飯蓮跟我一様假使不是萬分不得已的話是决不會累可憐的娘姨們跑來跑去的</p>
<p>我們在前門益社吃吃不到一碗飯忽然蓮的同鄉李君跑來和蓮談箇不休很親熱似的這位李君大槪就是她們常談的nide　Buy罷他們談得怪上勁的可是這時我不知怎様才好今日午飯吃得不多所以此時覺得非常之餓但是此時不知怎麽的我不敢吃快來壓滿我的食慾而且我的臉上忽然生起一種燥熱我不敢正眼望着他們更不敢和他們搭訕這種情態比上刀山還要難過想起來心就像要跳出身外似的跑躍起來臉就要像吃了三瓶白蘭地似的紅起來了唔難怪她們要譏笑我的</p>
<p>回到了房間已是黃昏時候了桌上擱着珩從故鄉寄來的一封信她說聽到别人說我的生活很好唉我的這種生活還配稱得一聲（好（字嗎眞是要命</p>
<p>夜幕漸漸地垂下了窗前的一切都漸漸地模糊起來了同時宿舍裏的喧嚷也漸漸地增加了留聲機·鋼琴·口琴Violio·笙·簫·笛·管·京戲·粤曲·Solo·合唱…………各種的聲調像雨後的春筍一般的發出了唉眞不得了耳膜幾乎要給牠們震破了加之珍姐的一些好朋友們也聚集在我們房間裹說長論短地談箇不休頭腦給她們閙昏了坐在房間裏和她們一起談罷自已没有那種好興緻抱着書本離開房間往圖書館去罷圖書館裏的那些可怕的情景眞夠使我恐懼了而且又怎能禁止她們說那些不堪入耳的譏諷話呢唉這種生活還能過得下去麽</p>
<p>電燈閃了好幾次了眼睛也很發脹明天又要考政治學只好不寫了筠寫於所謂的東宮</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>American Economic Tide and European Political Tide</h3>
<p>The World Society published a dispatch from Washington stating that the revolutionary trends in South American countries have greatly impacted American investment. American public and private investment in Latin American countries amounts to approximately 600 million gold dollars, with annual exports reaching 100 million, potentially leading to stagnation. Washington is reportedly uneasy. Recently, a wave of bank closures has surged in the American banking sector, increasing to 58 institutions, with no sign of abating. While the direct impact of South America is uncertain, the common origin in economic downturn is undeniable. As economic ties between the US and South America are closely intertwined, the current bank crisis in the US may inevitably influence South America. Although the political situation in South America is currently relatively calm, the underlying revolutionary spirit remains, with the potential for sudden eruptions. Previously, political issues led to economic changes; now, there are concerns that economic issues will trigger political unrest, with cyclical fluctuations preventing any semblance of tranquility.</p>
<p>The dangers exposed by the US and South America are economic, while those exposed by European countries are political. According to today's Berlin news, due to the victory of extreme factions in city elections and the election in the Free City of Danzig, German newspapers are urgently appealing to the world to pay serious attention. They argue that the radicalism of both the left and right wings is not unique to Germany, but stems from economic hardship. Unless this is swiftly resolved, it will spread uncontrollably. If other countries continue to turn a deaf ear and stand idly by, they will also be consumed. The urgency of their words reflects the immense crisis lurking. In summary, today's economic tides in all directions are converging on the political aspect and gradually revealing their true nature.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Indian Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Indian Representatives Advocate the Establishment of a Federal System; Committee to be Organized for Careful Consideration. Reuters, London, 18th. At today's plenary session of the Indian Round Table Conference, Prince Alwar spoke of the vision of a United States of India within the British Empire, stating that the Indian princely states do not seek new lands or powers, but seek the implementation of their treaties and covenants. Any rights outside of these treaties should be discussed in a straightforward and open manner and decided upon with the mutual agreement of the parties involved. As for British India, there are two paths to choose from: an Eastern or a Western conception of governance. The so-called Eastern conception would allow British India to revert to a princely state. This would allow for genuine autonomy, closer ties with the British Emperor, and a perpetual connection with the British Emperor. This is the quickest and most direct route to achieving dominion status. The so-called Western conception, i.e., responsible self-governance in India, has already sparked conflict between Hindus and Muslims, further complicating the future harmonization of relations between a democratically governed India and the Indian princely states. The Muslim representative, Shafi, stated that Macaulay had predicted in 1833 that India would demand a political system similar to that created in Europe, but the British Parliament has been sleeping soundly to this day, delaying matters and implementing measures that do not satisfy the public, only serving to make Indian aspirations more radical. If the conference still fails to find a way to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Indian people, the future is frightening to contemplate. The attitude of Indian Muslims is very simple: they merely want India to achieve dominion status, as an equal nation within the British Empire. He believes that only a federal system is suitable for the environment, so he welcomes the statements by the Princes of Bikanere and Alwar expressing the willingness of the Indian princely states to join an all-India federation. He hopes that the British representatives will summon the courage to realize that once this layer of Indian interests has been satisfied, imperial issues such as national defense, commerce, and unemployment can be resolved shortly. The representative of the Indian princely states' conservative faction, Prince Hua, stated that the Indian princes sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the intellectual leaders of British India. The princes strongly support the British Emperor. If a federal system would gradually cause the princes' support to be lost, then the princes would be unwilling to join. The British representative, Lord Peel (a Conservative who has twice served as Secretary of State for India), stated that the words of the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, were misunderstood by the Indian political world. The Viceroy's remarks did not permit India to be immediately transformed into a fully self-governing dominion. The British Conservative Party is paying close attention to the outcome of this conference, knowing that if the Round Table Conference agrees on some sort of constitution for India, a major political party in India will use the powers granted to it to pursue its goal of seceding from Britain and achieving independence. He believes that a complete government is impossible. He supports the federal idea. The discussions at the conference have proven that the federal idea is very popular. He believes that since a federation combining British India and the princely states is widely supported, it would be a pity if the conference did not lay the foundation for an Indian federation. Therefore, he advocates that the conference should work in this direction. Sir Charles, representing the European expatriates in India, stated that the European expatriates fully sympathize with the aspirations of the Indian people, but, given the dangers of too rapid change, he must issue a warning. Kiddle, representing the Anglo-Indian community, stated that he believes that the practical approach is to immediately grant full autonomy to the provinces. Once provincial autonomy has been achieved, they should be granted absolute freedom to join together and eventually form an all-India federation, with a strong and responsible central government. Minorities should have full and statutory protection. The Anglo-Indian community should not lose its status because it is half Indian and half European.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th. The important work of the Indian Round Table Conference can now be seen in the proposals of the Business Committee. The proposal advocates the organization of a committee to consider the structure of the Indian federal system, chaired by the Secretary of State for India, Bain, and composed of 32 members: six British representatives, sixteen representatives of British India, and ten representatives of the Indian princely states. Amendments to this proposal have been proposed in large numbers, and the Business Committee must consider them. The number of representatives attending the conference is large, and many wish to speak, so the representatives have been notified that the plenary session will be held on Thursday and may need to be continued.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Opposition Party Launches Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Al-Wafd Party, Cairo, 19th. According to reliable sources, the headquarters of the Wafd Party is currently preparing to mobilize the entire nation to resist the government and Great Britain. The reason for implicating Great Britain is that Britain has adopted a neutral attitude towards the country's internal strife, but in reality, it is siding with Prime Minister Sherif Sabry. It is said that the party plans to take steps to boycott British goods. In short, the situation of internal turmoil in the country has taken shape, and there are fears that a political struggle will erupt soon.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Exposes Major Anti-Government Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Many Military Officers Involved; Former Premier Arrested. Reuters, Berlin, 19th. Moscow reports that former Soviet Premier Serov was arrested for attacking Stalin. Subsequently, a far-reaching plan by Serov to undermine the authorities was discovered. Many important Communist Party members have also been arrested, including Andrei Yev, a member of the Higher Military Council, and General Biryukov, who recently led the Red Army to defeat the Chinese army in the Middle East and was praised as a hero by the people. It is reported that the mastermind is the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Antipov, and that many Russian military officers are involved.</p>
<p>Al-Wafd Party, Berlin, 19th. The news reported in the Social Democratic Party's newspaper that many Soviet government leaders had been arrested has not yet been confirmed. According to the newspaper, those arrested include General Karen, who is famous in the Far East, several important personnel from the Army Academy, and the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Supreme Soviet, Xionov, and others. Half of these conspirators who attempted to overthrow Stalin were Stalin's sworn friends. Because the Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, Rykov, feared being implicated in the event of failure, he confessed to Stalin, and the plot was exposed.</p>
<h3>Dr. Vincent Elected President of Haiti</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 18th. According to a report from the Haitian capital, former Haitian Senate President Dr. Vincent has been elected President of Haiti. Dr. Vincent is a member of the extreme opposition party and has worked hard to oppose the American occupation of Haiti. This is the first president legally elected in Haiti since it signed a treaty with the United States in 1915.</p>
<h3>Extreme Factions Dominate German Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>A Prairie Fire That Cannot Be Suppressed. German Newspapers Urge the World to Pay Attention. Al-Wafd Party, Berlin, 18th. The results of the municipal elections in Baden, Mecklenburg, and Oldenburg, Germany, and the Danzig Free City Council elections all show a sharp increase in the number of votes for extreme factions. As a result, German newspapers, especially the central party's newspapers, are calling on the world to pay serious attention, believing that the German government is striving to avoid economic, political, and financial crises, while the various states are standing idly by, providing no assistance whatsoever. This is probably due to a lack of attention to or understanding of the true situation. If the countries continue to turn a deaf ear to this situation, it will soon spread like wildfire and become uncontrollable. It must be known that the radicalism of the left and right wings is not unique to Germany. Its emergence is due to economic difficulties. If the root cause is not quickly clarified, it will soon spread to various countries and eventually become an irresistible force. Therefore, today's most important issue for the world is that major world politicians are deeply afraid that a word to resolve it will involve amending the Treaty of Versailles and the reparations plan, and therefore remain unmoved. Under these German circumstances, even the second International Economic Conference that opened yesterday in Geneva is unlikely to have major results, because what it is discussing is only secondary issues and may not be able to address the fundamental major problems of the current global economic decline.</p>
<h3>Wave of Strikes in Spain</h3>
<p>Spreads to Alicante</p>
<p>Situation in the Capital Still Peaceful</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 19th. In Barcelona, four people have died and thirteen have been injured in the two-day general strike. The situation has now improved, with shops gradually opening and trams resuming service. However, the wave of strikes has spread to Alicante. Newspapers have stopped printing, and all public offices are protected by the police.</p>
<p>Al-Wafd Party, Madrid, 19th. The general strike in Barcelona continues to be upheld. Shops and banks were guarded by the military police this morning and business continued as usual. Yesterday's strike riots extended into the late night, resulting in a total of four deaths, dozens of injuries, and more than 300 arrests. The situation in Catalonia, Alicante, and Asturias remains unchanged. Although construction workers in the capital have not yet resumed work, the situation is still relatively peaceful.</p>
<h3>Crisis in the American Banking Sector Continues</h3>
<p>Number of Closures Reaches 58. Associated Press, Little Rock, 18th. Thirteen more banks in Arkansas have closed, bringing the total to 58. The reason for the closure of these thirteen banks is to protect the interests of depositors.</p>
<h3>Italian Fiscal Budget Deficit</h3>
<p>Salary Cuts for Government Officials to Be Implemented. Reuters, Rome, 18th. The Italian fiscal budget for the first four months of the year has a deficit of 729,000,000 lire. Therefore, the cabinet has decided to reduce the salaries of all state officials by 12% to 35%, depending on their rank.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<h3>Telegram from Tianjin</h3>
<p>To the Fourth Plenary Session, the Central Party Headquarters, National Government Chairman Chiang, Deputy Commanders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Zhang, Premier of the Executive Yuan Zhu, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, Minister of Communications Wang Junjian: We have learned that China's telecommunications industry has been under foreign domination for decades. The outflow of money is incalculable, and the restrictions on communication are particularly painful to speak of. Fortunately, all of these contracts will expire at the end of this year. Moreover, with the end of the military campaign and national unification, all reforms are moving in the right direction. It was said that once people were sent to negotiate, these unequal treaties would be thoroughly abolished, and telecommunications would be bright. However, news has arrived that the chief negotiator, Zhuang Zhi, has betrayed the country and humiliated its sovereignty. The negotiation conference is merely a formality. Many of the unequal treaties remain in place. The right to land cables has been allowed to be extended for fifteen years, and the rights to manage and send/receive have not been abolished. Such a careless concession is a loss of sovereignty. We are shocked to hear this. What we have felt painfully for decades and wanted to resolve but could not, is now being handed over again. What is the point of the conference? What is the point of the negotiations? If this is the solution, how can the future of telecommunications be conceived? Moreover, the Tianjin Bureau has attached to it the Great Eastern and Great Northern submarine cable companies, which have absorbed and controlled unequal submarine cable fees and enjoyed all agency fees over the years. The pain felt is particularly acute. If the negotiations fail, we will be trapped in a state of sorrow forever. The situation is urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. Employees, etc., love and care for telecommunications and dare not fall behind others. Therefore, we submit this telegram, humbly requesting a swift and thorough investigation to save the situation and restore sovereignty. Awaiting orders. Respectfully, all employees of the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Beiping</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices: We are sending a telegram to the Fourth Plenary Session, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications, stating that China's telecommunications industry has long been restricted by the unequal contracts of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies, resulting in significant losses of rights and interests. Fortunately, all of these contracts will expire at the end of this year. In the interest of caution, our Ministry of Communications has specially appointed commissioners to organize an International Telecommunications Negotiation Committee to be responsible for handling the negotiation plan approved by the Executive Yuan. Telecommunications workers everywhere have praised this and have organized appraisal groups to provide support and promote the recovery of telecommunications sovereignty. However, according to investigation reports, the chief negotiation commissioner, disregarding his position as a central official, secretly contacted representatives of the respective companies privately before the meeting, plotting many things. At the meeting, he quibbled over trivial issues, using excuses to perfunctorily deal with them, and frequently made concessions on important points instead of fighting for them based on reason. The disclosures in the newspapers were also merely attempts to cover up the betrayal of the country and humiliation of its sovereignty. The negotiation plan of the Executive Yuan originally stipulated that in the event that negotiations result in our country being forced by circumstances to temporarily not abolish the right to land cables, it should be ordered to recognize the conditions and obtain a license with a limit of two years. However, the chief commissioner not only did not actively negotiate in accordance with the spirit of the plan, but also granted a long-term privilege of fifteen years for the years of submarine cable landings. This is the first betrayal of the country and humiliation of its sovereignty. Moreover, the negotiation plan originally stipulated that the respective companies should not directly send or receive telegrams in the future. However, the chief commissioner actually advocated completely abandoning the sovereignty of sending and receiving telegrams, arbitrarily proposing at the meeting that the respective companies should still enjoy all the real powers of employing personnel, administration, and sending/receiving, only to outwardly suspend the signboard of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau and use the excuse that our country can send personnel to inspect telegrams to cover up the fact. However, it is not known that inspecting telegrams is an inherent sovereignty of our country. Moreover, when foreigners send and receive telegrams in our country, they always send news that is unfavorable to the Chinese government or people first, and postpone important telegrams about major political situations or the public's important telegrams, reversing black and white and prejudicing the situation. Throughout history, politics, diplomacy, commerce, and public security have been greatly affected in intangible ways. Therefore, the right to send and receive telegrams must be in our own hands. This is the second betrayal of the country and humiliation of its sovereignty. Moreover, the relations, interests, and harms between the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Companies and our country are different. The pros and cons should be weighed, and negotiations should be conducted separately to break their joint forces, so that it would be easier to deal with them. Among them, the Pacific Company has a relatively shallow relationship with our country, and the Great Eastern Company's submarine cables have outlets in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia in addition to China, which cannot be compared to the Great Northern Company's sole reliance on our country as its business center. If negotiations were conducted separately with the Pacific and Great Eastern companies first, it would be easier to reach an agreement, and the Great Northern side would be trapped in isolation and easier to deal with. However, the committee had other intentions and suddenly allowed the three companies to hold a joint meeting with our country, allowing them to conspire against us together, resulting in the failure of the negotiations. While the foreigners conspired against us without any reservations, the chief commissioner also gave others an excuse to be self-serving. If he allows one country special rights, other countries will inevitably follow suit. The right to international telegraph services in Shanghai is still controlled by others, and we are still under control, not to mention that the reform of telecommunications will not be possible in the future. This is the third betrayal of the country and humiliation of its sovereignty. The above are just a few of the major points. As for the chief commissioner's forgetting of righteousness in the face of profit and seeking an inch but giving a foot, it is even more difficult to describe completely. The facts are all there and cannot be concealed. We humbly believe that this negotiation concerns the survival of telecommunications rights. The employees' hearts are in danger and cannot be kept silent. We should state the matter frankly and in detail, humbly requesting you to investigate and swiftly dismiss the chief commissioner from his concurrent posts and conduct a strict investigation. At the same time, select competent officials to take over and conduct negotiations seriously to restore national rights and maintain telecommunications. Respectfully awaiting orders with utmost urgency. The Hebei Province Telecommunications Workers Telecommunications Treaty Abolition Movement Committee.</p>

<h3>Publication of Exchange of Notes on Sino-British Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the exchange of notes between China and Britain today (the 19th), which are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Note from Minister Wang to British Envoy Blue One: Regarding the matter of a note, your government declared in December 1922 that the remaining balance of the British portion of the Boxer Indemnity would be used for undertakings of mutual benefit to China and Britain in the future. This minister sincerely hopes that your government will return all of the Boxer Indemnity due from December 1, 1922, to the Chinese government for management.</p>
<p>After the actual return of this fund, the Chinese government intends to handle it with reference to the main points in the 1926 Sino-British Advisory Committee Report. The main points of the report should be brought to the attention of the following board of directors. However, the Chinese government believes that the first step should be to use the bulk of the indemnity as a fund for future use in educational undertakings as mentioned in the Advisory Committee Report. From the perspective of the Chinese government, the most beneficial plan for establishing a fund is to use the bulk of the indemnity, including the currently stored funds and the funds to be paid in the future, to reorganize and construct Chinese railways and invest in other Chinese productive enterprises. As for the management, allocation, and disposal of the above-mentioned fund, the Chinese government will establish a board of directors, which should include a number of British people. Regarding the construction and development of China, the Chinese government, in view of the extraordinary need to reorganize China's existing railways, is prepared to use part of the existing and upcoming funds to reorganize the railways, with particular attention to the railways that are particularly related to British interests.</p>
<p>When reorganizing and constructing railways and operating other productive enterprises with the returned indemnity or the funds borrowed with the indemnity as collateral, the terms of existing contracts should be taken into account. However, if the funds are used to purchase necessary materials abroad, including bridges, locomotives, vehicles, steel rails, and other equipment, they should be ordered from Britain.</p>
<p>In order to implement the plan as soon as possible and to fully satisfy both governments, the Chinese government is prepared to agree to transfer all of the existing funds to the Purchasing Committee established in London for the purchase of bridges, locomotives, vehicles, steel rails, and other materials from British factories for China's state-owned railways and other productive enterprises. The Purchasing Committee consists of one chairman, i.e., the Chinese diplomatic representative in London, and one representative from the Chinese Ministry of Railways, and four other committee members. The chairman is the Chinese diplomatic representative in London, and one representative from the Chinese Ministry of Railways, and the four other committee members are recommended by the British Foreign Secretary with a list of reputable and commercially experienced people to the Board of Directors, and appointed by the Chinese government and the Board of Directors at any time. All of the Purchasing Committee's income, whether it is the funds that should be delivered to the committee as specified in this note, or the funds obtained from the storage or investment of any part of the funds that do not need to be used immediately, shall be exempt from various taxes. The Purchasing Committee's tasks are as follows: (1) To conclude and supervise the implementation of various contracts to supply and deliver British-made engines, machinery, and other goods and materials required and ordered by the Chinese government at any time in China. (2) To fulfill contractual obligations or obligations related to various contracts and pay the committee's expenses with the funds received by the committee in accordance with the conditions stipulated in this note, and to establish a savings fund with the funds that do not need to be used for this purpose immediately, so as to supply the Chinese government with the same needs in the future and the committee's own expenses. After all of the upcoming installments are due, the Chinese government will deliver them to the British government's representative in China, who will deliver half of them to the Purchasing Committee in London for use in the same manner and for the same purpose as described above, and the other half to the Board of Directors in China for management.</p>
<p>The funds spent in Britain should be regarded as loans paid by the Chinese Board of Directors to various railways or other productive enterprises, and interest should be paid and the final repayment should be assumed, and accurate accounts should be sent to the Board of Directors at any time. All funds for the repayment of the principal and interest of the loans should be delivered to the Board of Directors, which will immediately use them for educational undertakings. Accordingly, please examine and respond to this note. September 19, 1930, Republic of China.</p>

Regarding the organization, authority, and performance of duties of the Purchasing Committee, this is to state that this minister's understanding is as follows: 1.

<h3>The Strict Prohibition of Planting Opium Seedlings in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The prohibition of planting opium seedlings in Fujian Province was implemented last year. However, between the summer and autumn of this year, with the Taolu army rising, the provincial government was busy mobilizing troops and raising funds, without time to attend to other matters. Local gentry and wealthy merchants in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Xinghua, and Funing colluded with the stationed troops, enticing farmers to plant again in order to profit. The provincial government repeatedly received reports from local party headquarters and legal organizations, either saying that they were sowing or that they had already planted, requesting urgent prohibition to avoid poisoning. The provincial government ordered the Anti-Smoking Committee to quickly formulate measures to stop it. The committee then resolved: (1) If a county magistrate fails to report and eradicate opium seedlings within his jurisdiction, or if he has reported but the eradication is ineffective, he will be dismissed and investigated upon discovery. (2) The stationed troops and the county magistrate should bear the same responsibility for prohibiting opium seedlings within the defense zone. If opium seedlings are found within the defense zone, they should be subject to the same punishment as the county magistrate. (3) Opium seedling investigators will be assigned to various regions to assist local party headquarters and community organizations in going to the countryside to investigate. If opium seedlings are found, they should be photographed and reported in detail for punishment. If the report is false, it will be strictly investigated and not tolerated. (4) Each county will set up an anti-smoking supervisor to assist the county magistrate in handling the prohibition of planting, transporting, selling, and smoking. Currently, the first item has been circulated by the provincial government to all county magistrates for compliance. The second item has also been telegraphed by the headquarters to the military commanders stationed in Fujian for implementation. The third item, the opium seedling investigators, has been uniformly appointed by the Anti-Smoking Committee and received public funds in mid-last month, setting off in different directions. Many reports have been received recently. For the fourth item, anti-smoking supervisors in each county have also been successively announced and have taken office one after another. Recently, Zhang Zhen, commander of the New First Division, suggested that the provincial government order each army to send two representatives to jointly form an anti-smoking propaganda team to go to the defense areas of friendly forces to conduct on-site inspections to see if there are any opium planting situations to clarify the truth. With the consent of the army commanders, the provincial government sent Shi Ming and Cai Zhendong, and the Marine Corps Command sent Shen Kui and Chen Xiaogao, the 56th Division sent Gu Fangbai and Yang Guangxun, and the New First Division sent Zhang Xiangpu and Pan Chenge to hold a discussion meeting at the provincial government on the 11th of this month, resolving: (1) The entire team is divided into two groups. Group A investigates the three regions of Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Funing (all Marine Corps defense zones), and Cai Zhendong, Shen Kui, Pan Chenge, and Yang Guangxun are responsible for it. Group B investigates the three regions of Zhangzhou (New First Division defense zone), Quanzhou, and Yongchun (all provincial defense army defense zones), and Shi Ming, Chen Xiaogao, Zhang Xiangpu, and Gu Fangbai are responsible for it. (2) Propaganda commissioners have the right to report military and civilian officials who are ineffective in banning smoking, and the right to requisition local garrison troops to assist in the investigation. (3) Please order the Provincial Department of Finance to allocate 1,600 yuan in public funds to facilitate departure as soon as possible. At the same time, the provincial government discovered that opium seedlings had sprouted several inches in the Qingyang District of Jinjiang County (i.e., Quanzhou) and along the Quanzhou-Anhai Highway. On the 9th, it ordered the dismissal and investigation of Chen Renjie, the magistrate of Jinjiang County, as a warning to those who disregard the ban. The ban on smoking in Fujian Province has recently been vigorously enforced. (December 12th)</p>
<h3>Lu Xingbang Takes Up New Position in Yanping</h3>
<p>The 56th Division searches and suppresses bandit gangs in the northwest countryside. Fuzhou Correspondence: The provincial government ordered Lu's troops to withdraw from the three regions of Youxi, Yanping, and Jian'ou and concentrate in the four counties of Shayong, Shaoguang, and Guangze to await reorganization and additional commissions. Lu Xingbang has taken office as the vanguard commander for bandit suppression in western Fujian in Yanping on the 9th. At the same time, Zhou Zhisun also took office as the brigade commander of the newly formed Second Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, and a telegram was sent to the province on the 10th, reporting that he vowed to exert his utmost loyalty to support the government, strive to suppress bandits, and defend the people, to live up to the Chairman's and all committee members' intentions to pacify the locality. As for the vacancy of the third brigade commander of Lu's troops, Lu Xingming is waiting to be sent back from Zhejiang to fill the position.</p>
<p>The area along the river between Yanping and Shuikou, as well as the three townships west, south, and north of the provincial capital, have seen a resurgence of banditry since the cessation of hostilities. As a result, commerce and agriculture have been greatly affected. A month ago, a Japanese merchant, Aratani Kiyoshiro, was kidnapped by the bandit Huang Yusheng's gang while traveling from Yanping to the province on the Chai Pai Wu River surface near Huangtian. The newly formed First Brigade Commander Qian Yuguang of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Huangtian and the Deputy Division Commander Yan Er'ai of the 56th Division stationed in Shuikou have repeatedly sent teams to rescue him, but there has been no trace of him for many days. The Japanese Consul in Fujian is negotiating with the provincial government. The bandit gang led by Chen Tianlong in the north township is the largest, the bandit gang led by Chen Wei in the Nanxi township is the largest, and the bandit gang led by Li Yikuo in the west township is the largest, each with more than a hundred members roaming dozens of miles. The 56th Division Headquarters repeatedly received appeals from the people in various townships and sent a battalion of infantry led by Battalion Commander Wang Hongxing to cooperate with Wang Ruoheng, the magistrate of Minhou County, to launch a search and suppression campaign in the north township at the beginning of this month. They confronted Chen Tianlong's gang at Gaoshan in Furong Township for two nights before defeating the bandit lair and destroying it. Chen Tianlong then led the remaining troops to flee to Guanyuan in the west township. On the 11th of this month, another battalion of engineers was sent to cooperate with Wang Ruoheng, the magistrate of Minhou County, to launch a search and suppression campaign in the west township. They surrounded and bombarded Li Yikuo's gang at Yaxia in Yuan Guo Township for a night, killing more than fifty bandits and capturing more than fifty-three alive. Li fled alone. Yesterday morning (13th), the division headquarters escorted twenty-eight of the most serious offenders to the East Gate for execution. Most of them were between the ages of sixteen or seventeen and twenty-four or five, which is a pity for young people who have gone astray. After this painful suppression, the banditry in the northwest townships should be reduced. However, Chen Wei's gang in the south township still has its headquarters in the Chen Family Ancestral Hall in Zaiyi Township, intercepting merchants from Fuqing and Yongtai counties coming to the province. At the end of last month, they robbed the Yiyuan Remittance Bureau in Fuqing of more than 20,000 yuan in cash and banknotes. At the beginning of this month, they kidnapped many actors from the Xinguofeng and Shantongqi opera troupes and several boxes of costumes. The Marine Corps is now searching and suppressing the bandits. (November 14th)</p>
<h3>Appointment of Directors of Jilin-Changchun and Jilin-Dunning Railways</h3>
<p>Guo Xurun, Director of the Siping-Taonan Railway, also serves as the Director of Jilin. Jilin Correspondence: Since Han Linsheng was transferred to be the superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, the director positions of the Jilin-Changchun and Jilin-Dunhua Railways have not been filled. The Deputy Director Qi Yaokun is temporarily responsible for handling affairs. The Northeast Transportation Committee initially favored Cai Yunsheng and Yu Changfu, but both declined. The Transportation Committee believed that transportation on both routes was gradually becoming smoother in winter, and the railway affairs could not be without someone in charge. However, the candidate for the director in Jilin Province had to be approved by the local officials so that they could handle affairs smoothly. Zhang Zuoxiang was repeatedly asked to recommend a candidate. Zhang strongly recommended Guo Xurun, the director of the Siping-Taonan Railway, to fill the position. However, Guo had been working in Siping-Taonan for many years, and the Transportation Committee relied heavily on him and did not want him to leave. After discussions by all parties, it was decided that Guo would also serve as the director of the Jilin-Changchun and Jilin-Dunhua Railways, stationed in Changchun to handle affairs, while the deputy director would act on behalf of the director for the Siping-Taonan Railway. Important matters would be reported to the director for approval. The Transportation Committee then officially issued an order appointing Guo. After receiving the order, Guo immediately led five or six attendants on the South Manchuria Express train to Changchun on the evening of the 12th of this month. He immediately stayed at the Bank of Communications warehouse, while the attendants stayed at the Xiangcun Hotel. He scheduled to take over on the 14th. The Railway Bureau added a night shift starting on the 11th to rush the handover. Chen Jiale, the chief of the Jilin-Changchun General Affairs Office, resigned due to illness, and it was internally decided to promote a certain Ma, the director of the Jilin-Haiyuan Materials Factory, to the position. According to Guo, he came here to reorganize the business of the two railways, and the old personnel would not be replaced. However, it is heard that the personnel appointed by the former director Han must hand over their duties and go to Tianjin. Since Deputy Director Qi's intention to be promoted has not been realized, he is in a negative mood and plans to submit his resignation after Guo takes office. Then Qi's people will also have to leave with him. Jilin-Dunhua has always suffered from too many people, and it may be possible to economize slightly in the future. It is also heard that Guo has two missions here: (1) The issue of connecting the Jilin-Changchun and Jilin-Haiyuan Railways has been proposed by us for a long time, but the Japanese side has strongly obstructed it, and it has not been resolved. As a result, the Jilin-Haiyuan and Jilin-Changchun-Dunhua Railways have not been able to connect, which is very inconvenient. The Japanese side believes that once the connection is made, Jilin-Changchun may not be beneficial to the South Manchuria Railway and will be more affected, so they insist on dissenting, which is purely for their own benefit. The Transportation Committee believes that the railways are all state-owned, and although Jilin-Changchun has a loan relationship, connecting with other railways is originally to expand business and seek mutual benefits, and there is no fundamental incompatibility. It ordered Guo to negotiate with the Japanese side as soon as possible to connect the railways as soon as possible to facilitate the development of railway administration. (2) The issue of the Jilin-Dunhua project acceptance is being urged by the Japanese side. However, the poor quality of the project and the high price are actually calculated to be very different from the original amount. At that time, it was all done by the Japanese, so they should still be responsible. Both sides do not give in to each other. It also ordered Guo to handle it properly. (13th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Anhui Provincial Government to Detain Bao Geng</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The position of Special Commissioner for Finance in Anhui Province has recently been concurrently assumed by Yuan Jiapu, Director of the Department of Finance, who was appointed by the Ministry of Finance. Yuan has gone to Wuhu to take over the position a few days ago. It is planned to move the office to the old site of the Maritime Public Security Bureau in front of Qianjia Archway. Yuan has returned to the province because he is busy with the affairs of the Department of Finance. However, it was found that Bao Geng, the former Special Commissioner for Finance, had embezzled more than 450,000 yuan. Yuan reported to Chen Diaoyuan, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, who then ordered a thorough investigation of Bao's accounts during his tenure and telegraphed the Wuhu Public Security Bureau to temporarily detain Bao Geng until the handover was completed before releasing him. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to report the handling process. The original telegram is as follows: According to Yuan Jiapu, the concurrently appointed Special Commissioner for Finance, Bao Geng, the former Acting Special Commissioner for Finance, embezzled a total of more than 450,000 yuan during his tenure, including 12,728.521 yuan for road construction public debt funds, 29,957.61 yuan for special donations for compulsory education, 149,734.91 yuan for post-war public debt funds, 86,850 yuan for winning post-war public debt funds, 17,189.66 yuan for post-war public debt interest, 1,720.99 yuan for income donations, approximately 50,000 yuan overdrawn from the Central Bank, 2,212.99 yuan for income tax, and approximately 50,000 yuan pledged to the Bank of Communications with treasury bills. Empty checks were issued for 510 yuan for the pension of wounded soldiers in Sixian, 475 yuan for the pension of wounded soldiers in Lingbi, and 54,000 yuan for education funds. This is only what has been found so far, and more will be reported later. Most of the above items are managed on behalf of the local government, and no special funds can be withdrawn for the people. It is unknown what order Bao, the former special commissioner, relied on to embezzle them. As for issuing empty checks for more than 50,000 yuan, it is even more suspected of fraud. Such damage to the credibility of treasury bills, deprivation of people's rights, and harm to national prestige are quite serious. In order to rectify officialdom and maintain national discipline, we cannot ignore it. We have ordered the Wuhu Public Security Bureau to detain Bao Geng, investigate the accounts during his tenure, and recover the local arrears. Once the handover is clear and the public funds are not deficient, he will be released. Fearing that the outside world does not understand the truth, we hereby send a special telegram to report it to you for your review. Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government. (November 18th)</p>
<h3>Fan Xiji's Troops Defending Western Anhui</h3>
<p>One Brigade Goes to Susong to Suppress Bandits. Bengbu Correspondence: The 46th Division of Fan Xiji's troops concentrated in Taihe and Haozhou. Fan himself is still recuperating in Qingdao. Chen Diaoyuan believes that the western border of Anhui, connected to Henan, has been ravaged by bandits and communists. It is not enough to defend it without strong troops. In addition to ordering the division to garrison central Anhui, he also ordered them to defend western Anhui and take responsibility for pacifying the area. The 26th Army headquarters is still located in Bengbu. The division headquarters and the officers and soldiers directly under it set off from Haozhou on the 11th and are heading to Hefei. They will arrive within days. The deployment locations of their troops have been designated. The 136th Brigade of Wang Fanqing's troops will station one regiment in Fuyang and Taihe, and one regiment in Zhengyang and Shouzhou. The 137th Brigade of Chen Jiuchou's troops will temporarily go to Susong to suppress bandits. The 138th Brigade of Liu Yulin's troops will station in Lu'an and Huoshan. (November 16th)</p>
<h3>Plan for Reorganizing the Waterways Between Hankou and Wusong</h3>
<p>Chongwen Island is the First Major Obstacle Reorganization will Begin from This Point An Engineering Office is Planned to be Organized Locally.</p>
<p>The draft plan for reorganizing the waterways between Hankou and Wusong, proposed by the Yangtze River Waterway Reorganization Committee of the Ministry of Communications, was previously ordered by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Communications to prepare a detailed plan for appropriation and implementation. The Ministry of Communications then forwarded it to the committee, which was approved in principle by the 23rd Standing Committee Meeting after being drafted by Song Xishang, the director of the Engineering Department, under the leadership of Chairman Cai Peiling. The content is roughly as follows: Considering the current needs of the shipping industry, the required navigable depth between Hankou and Wusong is planned to be 15 feet throughout the year. Chongwen Island is the first major obstacle for ships with a draft of 15 feet. Based on the principle of starting water control from the lower reaches, this island should be the starting point for reorganization. Once the reorganization is effective, it will be implemented step by step to achieve the goal of reorganizing the entire section. The implementation plan for Chongwen Island is generally as follows:</p>
<p>River Flow Situation Chongwen Island is located 53 kilometers downstream of Anqing and stands side by side with Fenghuang Island. The river flow is divided into three. After the north channel was silted up, the south channel gradually expanded. In 1926, a middle channel was formed in between, and the river surface split, and the flow rate decreased sharply. Last winter, the depth of the new shoal in the downstream of the south channel was only three or four meters. According to the current situation, the middle channel is straight, so it is planned to designate this channel as the main channel for future navigation.</p>
<p>Reorganization Method Once the main channel is selected, the reorganization standard can be divided into three: (1) Guiding the river flow towards the middle channel using construction engineering. (2) Collecting the lowest water volume and completely injecting it into the middle channel using low water level dams. (3) Protecting the riverbank to prevent unexpected collapse using bank protection engineering. This design is based on the committee's engineering measurements over the years and the special nature of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Construction Steps In order to carefully consider the reorganization of the eleven shallow areas and to be economical, it is necessary to construct them in different places in order. Even in one place, the construction steps should be weighed according to the situation, and the urgency should be adjusted according to the situation, and the changes should be observed and dealt with at any time. Because water control engineering is different from ordinary construction engineering, and this plan makes more use of natural water power, it is necessary to allow the river to have an automatic improvement opportunity and then take advantage of the situation. In order to benefit from it, a mud dredger should be used as an aid when necessary. Therefore, the implementation steps of the Chongwen Island project can be divided into two phases: The first phase: (1) Construction engineering, (2) low water level dams, (3) bank protection engineering. The second phase: (1) Construction engineering, (2) low water level dams. After the implementation of the first phase of the project, it is believed that the river flow will tend to enter the middle channel, and the water power will have an automatic dredging trend. By that time, ships with a draft of 15 feet can pass unimpeded throughout the year, and the second phase of the project may as well proceed carefully according to the situation.</p>
<p>Working Time The implementation of this project must be started during low water levels, so the two seasons of summer and autumn are preparation time, and the two seasons of winter and spring are construction periods. Since the construction period is limited by the water level, the preparation work, such as conducting construction surveys, bidding, and purchasing equipment, must be fully prepared. Once construction starts, the first phase of the project must be completed within six months. Then, when the river water rises in the summer and autumn seasons, the effectiveness of the project and its automatic changes will be observed before determining the next step of the project.</p>
<p>Organization Plan The responsibility of river control engineering is heavy and the matter is complicated. The reorganization of Chongwen Island in this plan is only the starting point of implementation, and it already requires more than 5.3 million yuan. If there is no perfect organization, it may be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, it is planned to organize the Chongwen Island Engineering Office of the Yangtze River Waterway Reorganization Committee on the spot and appoint a chief engineer to preside over it.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Bandit Robbery Case in Sijing was Pronounced. The Sijing Town was the case where the town was attacked by bandits and Tai Bang in late April of this year, who killed police and looted wantonly. The Qupu and Jiading areas intercepted many escaped bandits, and some of them were found with stolen goods on the spot. The county government welcomed and brought them back for interrogation, and the county court was established and transferred to the court for investigation. Last month, a second debate was held, and a public defender was appointed to appear in court. The judge Li took a seat in the courtroom the day before yesterday and proclaimed the main text and recorded the case for publication. A total of six people were sentenced to death, and Wang Deyou and Wu Zhiyi were sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment. Xu Yubao and others were sentenced to 16 years of imprisonment. Shen Mu was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for the crime of depositing stolen goods. Mao Ziqing, Hong Zuojiang, Zhang Wang, Wang Shaoquan (i.e., Shao Fu), and Wu Hanying were all found not guilty. Dong Dachuan's public prosecution was not accepted. Convicted prisoners will have two days deducted from their sentence for each day spent in prison before the judgment is finalized.</p>
<p>The Anti-Smuggling Brigade Cancels the Investigation Team. The Anti-Smuggling Third Brigade Captain He Zikui was previously ordered to concurrently serve as the anti-bandit in Qupu in order to get intelligence and track down bandits for suppression. He appointed more than a dozen investigators and special agents to serve. Now, he is ordered to devote himself to anti-smuggling, and this item should be canceled. He has ordered all members to submit their symbols to the department and announced to all circles to avoid rascals making rumors.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>The Bandit Suppression Army Cracked Down on Bandit Dens. Wang Bing, a resident of the fourth neighborhood of the sixth township of Miaojin Township in the county, was suddenly surrounded by more than 40 armed soldiers of the Zhejiang Bandit Suppression Army at noon yesterday. They broke into the house and arrested two kidnapping bandits, rescued two hostages, and escorted them to the warship anchored on the side of the Huangpu River. Wang Bingsan, the owner of the bandit's nest, was out and failed to be captured on the spot.</p>
<p>Detailed Record of the Conflict Between Sun Jingqing and the Salt Field. Yang Yuxiang, the head of the first class of the sixth head, and Yang Hongsheng, the head of the sixth, seventh, and eighth classes, were guaranteed by Sun Xueqin, the deceased father of Sun Jingqing, a member of the Education Committee of the Second District, to collect the salt tax of the lower sand field. More than 4,900 yuan of accumulated salt tax has not been paid. As a result, when the field orders were distributed this year, the orders under the names of Yang Yuxiang and others were withheld and ordered to be paid within five days, and a new guarantee was required before the field orders could be issued. The other day, Education Committee Member Sun Jingqing went to the field and asked to take away the field orders of Yang Yuxiang and others, and Sun handed over two notes from the Luxiangyun Commercial Firm in this city, totaling 400 yuan, due on November 14th and 24th. Zhang Zhenjia, the accountant of the field, replied that the notes had to be checked by the store owner before they could take effect. Sun then said that he would. Later, the field sent someone to ask the Luxiangyun store owner whether he had issued the notes. The store owner strongly denied it. Until 10:00 p.m. that day, Sun Jingqing, while drunk, led his younger brother Guoqing and three unknown people into the field office and claimed to receive the field orders of the second class of the sixth group leader. Zhang Zhenjia, the accountant of the field, replied that the store owner had not recognized the notes, and the original guarantor (i.e., Sun's father, Xueqin) was dead, so a new guarantee had to be found before the orders could be issued. Sun Jingqing was furious and insisted on sitting down and demanding the orders. His younger brother Guoqing (the head of the sixth group's security team) took out a gun from his bag to show off. Although the field staff persuaded him politely, Sun's attitude was strong and almost violent. Fortunately, the guarantors tried their best to persuade him, and Sun finally led the people away angrily. Therefore, the field immediately drafted an official document that night accusing Sun of implementing violence, coercion, obstructing official duties, and forging seals, and sent a letter to the county government requesting detention, and also presented a letter to the Songjiang salt transport deputy envoy to transfer the matter to the provincial government, ordering the education department to dismiss and punish Sun. The other day, Yang Binru and other directors of the Education Bureau visited the field to intercede for Sun, but the field firmly refused to yield, making the matter difficult to resolve. Now, the county government has issued a ticket and scheduled to summon Sun for interrogation on the 20th. It is heard that Sun has also begged a certain important person at sea to come to Nanhui to stop the matter, but it is unknown whether it can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Father Insists on Marriage, Daughter Still Longs for Old Flame. Gao Bingwen, a farmer in the fortieth map of the eighth district, adopted Zhang Meijuan as his adoptive daughter because he was old and without an heir in 1924. He betrothed her to his nephew Gu, but Gu was a dissolute young man, so Gao gathered his relatives in January last year to discuss breaking off the engagement. At that time, he separately sought out his nephew Yang Heshang to continue the marriage. Unexpectedly, although the daughter had not married her former lover, the two had already developed feelings for each other. However, because it was difficult to disobey her father's orders, she could not bear to suppress her feelings and secretly continued to associate with him. Recently, her husband knew about it and greatly blamed her, and her father also disciplined her not to cross the line. Until the other day (18th), she was scheduled to go to her uncle's house, so she took this opportunity to meet her former lover on the way and eloped with him. They hid in her older sister Zhang Aimei's house in Taiping Township, Nanhui, to observe the situation. Gao Bingwen had already anticipated that his daughter would leave, so he went to find her with his son-in-law Yang Heshang yesterday morning. The daughter firmly refused to return, and they argued for a long time, almost resorting to violence. Later, after a relative Zou heard the news and came to mediate, she agreed to return. However, Yang publicly stated that he did not want to marry her and proposed a treaty not allowing her to continue her relationship with her former lover.</p>
<p>Bandits Arrested in Zhuangxing. According to a tip-off, the Zhuangxing Patrol Division learned that a large number of bandits were hiding in the thirteenth map, about three miles away. At 12:00 p.m. the other day, they sent police to search and arrested Chen Xiaogou, Chen Aimei, and others in the north and south of Yitu River. Two pawn tickets for genuine thieves were found in Aimei's house, including a serge wool coat. It has already been recognized by the owner, surnamed Pan, from Fahua Bridge. Only Chen Maodi was determined to be falsely accused by the bandits, so he was released the same day with proof from Jiang Sanjin, the head of the map.</p>
<p>Patrol Chief Injured in Gambling Arrest. Li Yongsheng, a patrol chief of the Third Public Security Bureau, led police to investigate and ban smoking and gambling in the Yituan area near Zhou the other day. Most of the people there were Jianghu migrants who were strong and unruly. They gathered a crowd to rob weapons and resist arrest, and injured the patrol chief on the head and face on the spot. After Chen Xuezhu, the director of the bureau, heard the news and went to rescue him, he was able to escape the danger. In addition to immediately sending the patrol chief and two seriously injured policemen to Shanghai Baolong Hospital for treatment, the director of the bureau, General Li, personally went to investigate and arrest all the leading offenders today.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Arrest Warrant for Head Trafficker Wang Waitou, Iron Incense Burner Outside Yan Gate: Round Street Soil Trafficker Wang Waitou. Following the case in April of this year involving Police Captain Wu Shaowu's extortion of a large sum of 1,000 yuan, Wu immediately fled. Subsequently, due to involvement with Ma Fanglin's concubine, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau, led by Team Leader Zhou, arrested Ma and sent him to the local court for interrogation. Suddenly, on October 21st, Ma Fanglin's son, Wenbin, captured Wang Waitou and handed him over to the Second Division of the Third Branch for handling. Later, Team Leader Zhou from the Criminal Investigation Team intervened, bailed out Wang Waitou, took him to Room 37 of the New Su Tai Hotel to negotiate terms, and released him, allowing him to escape. Ma Wenbin also sued Team Leader Zhou for privately releasing the soil trafficker, filing a lawsuit with the local court. The court repeatedly summoned Wang Waitou, but he remained at large. The local court prosecutor's office, considering Wang Waitou a key suspect who needed to be arrested for investigation, issued an official letter yesterday (19th) to the land and water public security organs, requesting their joint efforts to apprehend Wang Waitou.</p>
<p>Sentencing in Parricide Appeal Case: Zhang Shun-sheng, a villager from Fangtian Village, Chefang Township, in the county, was strangled to death and his body dumped in the river in November of last year by his birth mother, Ni, and his wife, Zhang, in collusion with his lover, Mao Xinglin. The Wu County Local Court sentenced Mao Xinglin to death, his mother, Zhang Ni, to five years imprisonment, and his wife, Zhang Zhang, to fifteen years imprisonment. Mao Xinglin and others appealed to the High Court, refusing to accept the verdict. After repeated trials by Huang Bingdao, Presiding Judge of the Third Criminal Division of the High Court, lasting three months, the verdict was issued yesterday afternoon (19th), upholding the death sentence for Wang Xinglin, five years for Zhang Ni, and fifteen years for Zhang Zhang. The convicts cried in court upon hearing the verdict, vehemently proclaiming their innocence.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Forming Gangs in Nan Ku Town: More than ten bandit ships and approximately two hundred bandits were discovered yesterday in Nanku Temple Front and other areas along the lake in Wujiang County. The bandits, a combination of gangs from Henan and Haizhou, planned to seize weapons from various lakeside towns to replenish their strength. Xu Boying, Captain of the Fourteenth Platoon of Wujiang, discovered this and, in addition to dispatching patrol boats to key locations for defense, personally came to Suzhou to report to District Chief Shen and request instructions.</p>
<p>Replacement of Lu Mu District Chief: Zou Zhaoxiang, the current Lu Mu Sixth District Chief, has been ordered to go to the provincial capital for supplementary training. Zhou Nianchun and other citizens of the district presented a complaint to the province, accusing Zou of dereliction of duty. The Department of Civil Affairs ordered the county to investigate and respond. Yesterday, the Department of Civil Affairs specifically ordered County Magistrate Huang to appoint Shen Yuan as acting district chief to fill the vacancy left by Zou Zhaoxiang.</p>
<p>High Court Recruiting Trial Judges: The High Court President Lin, following an order from the ministry, is recruiting trial judges. Registration is scheduled to begin on the 26th of this month and end on January 6th of next year. The examination is scheduled for January 19th. Once admitted, candidates will be sent to local courts for training, and upon achieving satisfactory results, they will be assigned to various counties. A public announcement was issued yesterday to inform the public.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>County Government Mediates Labor-Management Dispute at Silk Mills: Due to the severe decline in the silk market and business difficulties, the Wuxi silk mills jointly decided to request the county government to instruct silk mill workers to reduce their wages by 20% from October onwards, following Shanghai's method, in order to maintain operations. The county government then decided to convene a mediation meeting with representatives from both sides. However, the labor side, due to the urgency of the situation, was unable to nominate representatives and requested an extension. Subsequently, the county government appointed Tao Chuansheng and Ye Qiaoyun as representatives for the labor side and rescheduled the mediation meeting for the 18th. However, the labor representatives still failed to attend due to various reasons. The county government has now decided to convene an arbitration meeting in accordance with the Law on Handling Labor Disputes, with representatives from the party, government, county court, chamber of commerce, and labor union, in order to resolve all outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Update on Continuous Robbery and Kidnapping Case: On the 6th of last month, five consecutive robberies and the kidnapping of seven people occurred at Wangjiaqiao Dengjia, located at the border of Jing and Taibo cities. Two days later, the bandits released Ling Rend and Ling Xian, instructing them to inform the families of the other kidnapped victims to quickly prepare ransom money for their release. Despite numerous negotiations over the past month, no agreement was reached. The victims received another letter from the bandits a few days ago, arranging a meeting at a certain location. The result of the negotiation was a ransom price of 24,500 yuan. The victims are now separately raising funds, and it is expected that the hostages will be released within a few days.</p>
<p>Self-Proclaimed Adjutant Exposed: Gao Zijing, from Gaochedun, Yangming Township, has a modest fortune and moved to Xixi, in the city, several years ago. A few days ago, five people wearing military uniforms and speaking with foreign accents arrived, one of whom was wearing an armed belt and carrying a letter of appointment from the General Headquarters of the Huai-Xu Anti-Rebel Army, claiming to be an adjutant. He said that Gao's son had previously asked their Commander-in-Chief to secure a position as Director of the Management Office, and that the appointment letter was now here. He requested that Gao quickly prepare his luggage so that they could go together. Gao, seeing armed soldiers at his door, was already terrified, and was even more bewildered by the news. He replied that his son was currently away and that a decision could only be made after his return. Unexpectedly, the so-called adjutant suddenly became enraged and threatened Gao. Gao became even more suspicious and immediately reported the matter to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Gao Lian, the Chief of the Branch, personally investigated and examined the letter of appointment, discovering that it was a forgery.

<p>County Magistrate Strictly Prohibits Extorting Confessions Through Torture: The county government believes that the various bureaus, districts, and groups directly under its jurisdiction rely solely on confidential reports without investigation when searching for bandits. They do not focus on the facts and lack concrete plans. They act rashly, traveling long distances, and upon finding no bandits, resort to searching. They often arbitrarily arrest innocent villagers, even resorting to torture to fabricate confessions. By the time they are brought to the county for questioning, they deny the charges. They are detained for investigation, and by the time the truth comes out, several months have passed. The innocent are unfairly implicated and lose their jobs. This is contrary to the government's intention to protect human rights according to the law. Yesterday, an order was issued prohibiting arbitrary arrests and extorting confessions through torture. Violators will be prosecuted for dereliction of duty and violation of freedom, in accordance with the relevant articles of the law.</p>

<h3>Proposal to Improve People's Entertainment Methods to Embody the Spirit of Education Approved by the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiaxuan's proposal to improve people's entertainment methods to embody the spirit of education was approved by the Sixth General Assembly of the Fourth Plenary Session and submitted to the National Government to order the relevant educational authorities to implement it effectively and to order the party branches to publicize it. The full text of the original proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>The Chinese people lack entertainment options, and the methods are poor. The world criticizes the events such as gambling and opium, which have become the societal entertainment in our country. The quality of entertainment methods has a significant impact on work advancement. In advanced countries, people have numerous entertainment methods, most of which not only do not hinder the health of body and mind, but can also help their development. Even collecting antiques and rubbings embodies the spirit of research. The strength of a nation can be seen not only in its work but also in its entertainment methods. People in rural areas of Hebei and Shandong provinces use stone locks as a means of entertainment, while people in Qing Tian, Zhejiang Province, use wrestling and boxing as a means of entertainment, thus restraining the gambling culture in both places. They develop a healthy physique capable of enduring the labor of work. Therefore, in order to passively prohibit bad entertainment, it is necessary to actively promote good entertainment to achieve the effect of regulating the people. It is proposed to use the power of the Party to promote good entertainment and popularize it in every village, neighborhood, household, and individual in the country to embody the spirit of education. The methods are as follows. Does it seem appropriate? Please decide.</p>
<p>1. Establish public sports grounds in various villages and neighborhoods, guide sports methods, and promote sports competitions to cultivate a healthy physique for the people.</p>
<p>2. Plant trees and provide sports equipment and stone benches in open spaces everywhere so that people have a place to rest and relax.</p>
<p>3. Establish small-scale popular libraries and agricultural, industrial, and commercial product showrooms in various places so that people can observe and refer to them at any time.</p>
<p>4. Hold various exhibitions regularly in various places and encourage private exhibitions.</p>
<p>5. Produce various educational film clips related to work and distribute them to various places for screening.</p>
<p>6. Compile books on the textual research of various implements so that people who like to collect antiques can use them as references and develop systematic research.</p>
<p>7. Establish popular lecturers in various counties to give popular lectures in rural villages and towns every day.</p>
<p>8. Organize famous scenic spots everywhere and facilitate transportation and accommodation, provide tourist guides, and set up guidance personnel.</p>
<p>9. Establish broadcasting stations in various major places and set up wireless radios in major streets of various villages to receive various lectures, music, and operas.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Investigation into the Establishment of Education Department by the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Operating a Knife in the Room is Dangerous to China's Culture The Ministry of Education Orders the Municipal Education Bureau to Investigate and Report in Detail The Shanghai Public Concession recently established an Education Department specifically to manage education in the concession. The Chinese Minister of Education Jiang Menglin believes that this matter not only concerns the concession, but also endangers China's culture and must be stopped as soon as possible. The Municipal Education Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Education yesterday to investigate and report in detail. The order states that Shanghai newspapers recently reported that the Public Concession has recently added an Education Department and ordered the concession's elementary schools to complete and submit forms by the end of December to facilitate management. Education is the lifeblood of the country. If foreigners are allowed to manage educational matters run by Chinese people within China's territory, it will not only damage China's sovereignty and disrupt China's educational administrative system, but it is like operating a knife in the room, endangering China's culture and harming our nation. This is an unprecedented case in the world and a strange shame in our country. Serious negotiations should be made to protect national rights and prevent aggression. However, the true situation is. The bureau should investigate in detail as soon as possible and report it for verification. This order!</p>

<p>What is also mentionable is that the school had not given much attention to the physical facilities for the students, thus, it became custom that the school gives the student council a 70 Yuan subsidy per period. Since last semester, The school had been at odd with the student council and this subsidy, excluding certain small claims and debts, had reached a sum of 100 Yuan this period. One day prior to the strike, the school wrote a check for the student council to claim in The Yokohama Bank, but due to the duties of the student council, staff were asked to go, However, the payment was denied until yesterday.</p>

<h3>Ge Shaolong Obtains Medical Doctorate in Japan</h3>
<p>Dissertation is on the Study of Tonsillitis.  The Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun in Japan published (Mr. Ge Shaolong of the Republic of China came to Japan in the 7th year of the Republic, graduated from Kyushu Imperial University in the 16th year of the Republic, and then entered the Department of Otolaryngology of the same university. Under the guidance of Dr. Kubo Inokichi, the foremost otorhinolaryngologist in Japan, he engaged in the pathological and bacteriological research of tonsils. This year, he obtained a medical doctorate. In Japan, only one or two people have obtained a doctorate degree only three years after graduating from university, which is even rarer among foreigners. Mr. Ge's thesis is on the relationship between tonsils and nephritis. In the past, no one had clarified the cause of tonsillitis. Mr. Ge started with animal experiments to prove that nephritis and hemolytic streptococci have an extremely close relationship. That is, the infection of streptococci causes tonsillitis, which then causes toxins to diffuse throughout the tonsil and migrate to the circulatory system to reach the kidneys. The inflammatory effect of the toxins alone causes nephritis, which is an extremely valuable discovery in medicine.) According to reports, Mr. Ge is from Dongtai, Jiangsu. He graduated from the Jiangxi Provincial Medical College. He worked as a military doctor for several months before resigning and going to Shanghai to study foreign languages for a year. In the 7th year of the Republic, he went to Japan to study diligently for fourteen years. He usually has many works published in German professional journals. His thesis will also be published in German. Japan does not easily grant doctoral degrees to people, and it is even more remarkable to obtain it in a short period of time. Mr. Ge is thirty-two years old this year and is also good at literature. In the future, he will make great contributions to the academic world of our country, which can be predicted.</p>

Chen Jinzhi's Spike Worked and Jinan Took the Lead with Two to One, but This Attack Shanghai University also Scored Two Points and Took the Lead Again.

After Exchanging Venues, Shanghai University Took the Lead with Eleven to Eight. After Attacking Again, Shanghai University First Scored One Point. Jinan Tried Hard to Counterattack, the Situation Suddenly Became Strong, and Shanghai University Committed Suicide Again and Again. Jinan Surpassed One Point with Thirteen to Twelve. Since Then, the Two Heroes Have Competed with Each Other, and the Score Has Been Repeatedly Tied, and the Situation is Very Tense. From a Tie of Thirteen, It Continued to a Tie of Fourteen.

<h3>Shanghai University Reversed the Defeat and Won in the First Game</h3>
<p>Resting and Fighting Again, Jinan Tried to Retaliate, and the Momentum Was Extremely Strong. Chen Jinfang's Serving Was Excellent, and Shanghai University Suddenly Showed Panic. Cheng Guoxiang, the Center, Pressed the Ball Very Hard, but Was Rescued by the Second and Third Rows of Jinan. Shanghai University Was Difficult to Advance and Retreat, and There Was No Way to Implement It, and Jinan Chen Jinzhi's Spike Was Like a Bullet, and He Scored Nine Consecutive Points All the Way. Shanghai University Has Not Yet Opened the Record, Thinking That Jinan Is Expected to Retaliate. Unexpectedly, Shanghai University Calmed Down and Tried to Counterattack. Wu Ruisen and Liang Zuwei Scored One Point Each, Chasing Four Points. Jinan Won the Serving Opportunity and Added Only One Point. Shanghai University Took Over the Hard Work, Ye Yu Xing Made a Serve, Cheng Guoxiang Made a Strong Attack and Added Three Points.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Dismissed with a Laugh</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>A—Mr. C is really a great economist. The other day, when he was drinking coffee, he accidentally overturned half a cup on a friend sitting next to him, soiling a pair of white flannel trousers.</p>
<p>B—What did he do? He had to have them cleaned, right?</p>
<p>A—He demanded that the friend compensate him for half a cup of coffee, saying that it was eaten by his trousers.</p>
<p>A—This time, Old Bing and I fell out. He said I was a rogue, and I said he was a swindler.</p>
<p>B—Don't argue, you two. I think neither of you is wrong. You each have sufficient reason.</p>
<p>Girl A—I don't really like this new cheongsam. Look, the fabric is six yuan a foot. The workmanship of the velvet dressmaker isn't bad either, but somehow it just doesn't look good on me.</p>
<p>Girl B—That's probably a matter of talent, and you can't force it. Why don't you give it to me to wear?</p>
<p>Wife A—My husband is a soft-hearted person. When the children make mistakes, he only says a few words and then it's over. He never wants to slap the children on the head.</p>
<p>Wife B—My husband is even more soft-hearted than yours. Even if the carpet is covered with dust, he doesn't want to slap it.</p>
<h3>Returning from the World Esperanto Association</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dingming</p>
<p>Esperanto was created by the Polish person Zamenhof using scientific methods. It is simple in structure and easy to learn. Its purpose is to hope that mankind will rely on a common language to eliminate estrangement and realize love. My motivation for joining the Esperanto correspondence school is precisely for this reason.</p>
<p>The newspaper on November 12th carried news of the arrival of the Central Committee of the Esperanto Movement in Shanghai. After careful observation, I discovered (a lecture at the Esperanto Society at 75 Hongxingfang, Baoshan Road, starting at 5 p.m. on the 14th). At 4:30 p.m., I took time out of my busy schedule to find it, and finally saw the five-pointed green star flag hanging high in front of the gate. Inside, there was a portrait of Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, hanging in the center, and small square Esperanto green star badges hanging all over the walls. There were about thirty people present, including a female comrade and a dwarf who was as tall as the table, which were the most eye-catching. After a while, a German came and spoke to a certain official in the meeting in Esperanto very naturally. He waited until after 5 p.m. but they still didn't come, and everyone was unhappy. It was not until after 6 p.m. that Mr. Sheila (American nationality), the representative of the International Esperanto Central Committee, finally came with his comrade Mr. Bellair (French nationality), accompanied by Mr. Sun Yizhi, Executive Committee member of the Shanghai Esperanto Society, and our Esperanto scholars were very happy. Mr. Sheila carried a large leather suitcase and placed it on the table. Then he took out the projector, unloaded the light bulb, and connected it to the projector. First, Mr. Sun Yizhi delivered a speech in Esperanto to Mr. Sheila and others, welcoming them and asking them to speak. Then he translated it into Chinese. Mr. Sheila was full of energy and spoke clearly, saying roughly (I was entrusted by the Geneva Global Esperanto Society in Switzerland to be a special representative to inspect the status of the Esperanto movement in various countries during this trip around Europe and Asia. I took more than 20,000 photos along the way, and I feel very refreshed physically and mentally. There are many comrades in Europe. Even when I lectured in Japan, there were more than 10,000 comrades, all of whom were very polite and could all speak orally. It is a great pleasure to meet the members in China in Shanghai. I only hope that all members will pay special attention to using Esperanto to speak.) He also said (Mr. Sun translates very well. Japanese people use Japanese to translate each sentence more than twice as much as Esperanto. Chinese people use Chinese to translate each sentence less than half as much as Esperanto, and European people cannot distinguish between Chinese and Japanese.) Then, more than 300 films were shown, and each important one was explained. Mr. Sun Yizhi, who was kind and had a correct and fluent voice, and Mr. Pan Tishu of Fudan University, who was innocent and cheerful, translated each paragraph. As for the films, in addition to Chinese and Japanese, there were Indians and photos of flowers, people, and scenery from 2,000 years ago and today in Los Angeles, gathering the scenery of thousands of years, several continents, and all seasons in one time, which was rare and I was happy to feast my eyes.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr. Bellair, an Esperanto scholar who toured the world by bicycle, gave a speech, saying roughly (I set off from Lyon, France on July 24, 1928, and have traveled more than 30,000 miles, passing through Central Asia and entering Soviet Russia to Beijing, Japan, and Shanghai. At first, I thought that Chinese people were barbarians who drank blood, but now I know that it is not the case. The mountains and rivers have different scenery, and the people are bustling and courteous. I am going to Guangzhou via Annam, Burma, and the South Pacific Islands, Australia, and then return to the country via the Americas), etc.</p>
<p>I went to the Esperanto Society for the second time that day. I had neither communicated nor continued my research before, because I was busy running around for food and clothing. Therefore, when the meeting ended, I talked with my Esperanto professor, Mr. Sun Yizhi, for a while, and then took my admission certificate, a photo of me when I came to Shanghai last year, and a recent photo and gave them to Mr. Sun. Just as Mr. Sun was looking at them carefully, Mr. Sheila glanced at them and said a few words. Only after Mr. Sun translated it once did I know that he wanted to exchange photos. I immediately asked Mr. Sun to write my name in Esperanto on my behalf. Mr. Sheila also signed his name in his own handwriting and gave me a photo. We shook hands and said goodbye. When I returned to the club, it was already 9 o'clock. I wrote it down with a wet pen to tell those who love Esperanto.</p>
<h3>Record of Viewing Paintings at Yuyuan Garden</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>There is a fine arts and calligraphy association next to the zigzag bridge in Yuyuan Garden. The person in charge is Mr. Yang Dongshan, who uses elegant ways to practice philanthropy, and the method is excellent. After Mr. Yang passed away, Bailongshan continued to take charge of it and did not replace it. Since the establishment of the Gaofeng Festival, a painting and calligraphy exhibition has been held every ten days. Yesterday, I took advantage of my trip to Yuyuan Garden with Jingren and visited the exhibition to view the works and meet Pan Zijingzhai. The warm hospitality and the dazzling array of paintings and calligraphy on the four walls. Two landscapes made by Jingzhai have a bleak artistic conception that makes people fascinated. Huang Binhong's "Jiuhua Feijian Picture" has a majestic spirit that is enough to compete with the ancients and is on par with his contemporaries. Wang Zhongshan's figures are wonderfully vivid, which can be said to be equally wonderful. Ye Weishen's brush and ink are light and elegant, and a cicada and a crab are self-contained and interesting. Weishen is pointing out his descendants, so his family studies should be inherited. Zhao Yunhe's family is elegant, and his father and son have both inherited the learning of Lao Gang. The plum bamboo and small stones are full of wildness, and they are naturally divine. His daughter Yuanzhen's works are not weak either. She has been immersed in it for a long time and has the ability to wield it freely. Qian Yunhe's Eighteen Arhats are exquisitely unparalleled. The most vivid and interesting one is a frame of apricot marrying a picture, taking from Wenchang's Miscellaneous Records that Li Guanqing's apricot flowers in front of the hall are many but not fruitful. A matchmaker smiled and said that this apricot would be married next spring. In the deep winter, he suddenly carried wine and asked for a girl's skirt to tie to the tree and bid farewell. Next spring, there will be countless fruits. Yunque is suitable for marrying his daughter Yunshan on Double Tenth Festival, so he borrowed it to express his feelings. After admiring the whole exhibition, Jingzhai showed a Zhang Fei crab. The crab was as big as a walnut shell, with a drunken red color and lines like cracked eyes and upright eyebrows. It was very similar to the vigor of the Marquis of Xing. The two small feet were bent upwards, like the halberd of a beard, and the two claws were tightly attached, which was its first armor. It is said that the crab is produced along the coast of Wenzhou. It becomes stiff as soon as it comes out of the water, so those who get it often soak it in alcohol so that it can be stored for a long time to observe the difference. Before leaving, Jingzhai left behind a "Sea Ink Forest," which was compiled by Mr. Dongshan himself. There were still many omissions, and he planned to supplement it slowly to continue Mr. Dongshan's will.</p>
<h3>Occasional Words of Sound and Light</h3>
<p>— Zhi He</p>
<p>The famous comedian Charlie Chaplin's sound film has finally become a reality with the trend of the times. Although Charlie Chaplin has always opposed sound films, believing that they will reduce many silent beauties, the development of sound films is ultimately an upward development of the film industry. Charlie Chaplin also cannot help but consider it. In the future, what will be the sound of his big leather shoes compared to the song of Broadway?</p>
<p>One of the biggest shortcomings of Western sound films is that they overemphasize song and dance and emphasize the plot of the film, which leads to a slight offense of being monotonous and ultimately feels tasteless. This is also why Chaplin opposes sound films. However, if sound films can take into account the plot, then painting images and sounds will naturally be more touching. The entertainment of the ears and eyes is integrated with the stimulation of the brain, and the fun is profound.</p>
<p>Domestic films have not yet been seen in reality, but this is a new product that adapts to the times and there is no doubt about it. It is heard that the Star Company has also established a separate organization to focus on a large-scale plan, and all the plans have been completed, and the first film (The Singing Girl Red Peony) has been filmed and will be released within the year to give our ears and eyes a new experience. This is a new contribution of domestic new films and cannot but make us happy. However, I dare to speak to the company that the sound films that are shot must seek the twists and turns of the plot and not necessarily seek the abundance of songs and dances. It is well known that (The Singing Girl Red Peony) is a tragedy that writes about the life of a singing girl, wandering and drifting, with extreme twists and turns in her success and failure. In addition, there are insertions of Peking opera, drum songs, ditties, and new songs, which are also tight, tense, tortuous, and lively. The success of the film is not to be said.</p>
<p>(The beauty of silence) is strongly praised by general writers, and my teacher Yu Pingbo even has a long article to enlighten it. However, in the film, if there is a suitable control, the movement and stillness will make people feel as if they are in the scene. For example, in the autumn night of West Lake, all sounds are silent, and suddenly the sound of a bell is heard, what is its subtlety? I hope that the Star Company will work hard to make domestic sound films achieve a perfect success.</p>
<h3>Ms. Ya Nan's Joining the Tianchan Opera House</h3>
<p>— Cai Diaotu</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu Ya Nan (original name is Nai Geng) is the wife of Mr. Naigen, a famous person in the amateur opera world. She is a pillar of the Shanghai Kun opera amateur world with a clear and elegant voice, a graceful demeanor, and a demeanor that is quite similar to Wan Hua. Her voice is especially mellow. She is capable of performing many operas, such as "Red Phoenix Wedding", "Farewell My Concubine", "The Biography of Hongfu", "Lian Jinfeng", "Hongxian Steals a Box", "The Golden Lock", "Stabbing Tang", "The Imperial Stele Pavilion", "A Mistake in the Flower Field", etc., all of which are her masterpieces, and each of them has a unique feature. She can be said to be a master of synthesis. This spring, the ninth birthday of Mrs. Yu Qiaqing's mother was celebrated. Famous amateur opera figures such as Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Yu Yefeng, and Xie Baosheng initiated a grand joint performance. Ms. and Mrs. participated in it. On the second day of the charity performance, Ms. performed two consecutive operas, such as "Yu Tang Chun" and "Zhu Hen Ji" (a collaboration between the couple). The guests all praised her. At that time, Mr. Gu Zhuxuan, the manager of Tianchan, was also present and was amazed by her talent and praised her. He once expressed his intention to hire her to Mr. Xiaolai and Yefeng. At that time, Hankou, Qingdao, and other places had already sent people to Shanghai to compete to invite her, but Ms. did not want to go into professional opera and declined them all. Therefore, Mr. Gu's invitation was not granted. Now that Mr. Gu has taken over the Shanghai stage, reorganized Tianchan, and again entrusted Mr. Wang and Yu to repeat the previous request, it was only after several consultations that he was allowed to do so. However, he did not accept a salary, only a husband. It is heard that she is scheduled to take the stage today (the 20th). In the first two or three days, she will be allowed to perform "The Golden Lock", "Lian Jinfeng", and "Hongxian Steals a Box". It is heard that she will also join new drama performances. Those who admire Ms.'s art should be eager to see it first.</p>
<p>Correction In the "Notes on Visiting the Collection of Books in Tianyi Pavilion, Ningbo" published on November 11th, the fifteenth line (and copied slightly from Mr. Huang Lizhou to add to it) Huang Lizhou is Wang Yanzhou's mistake, and it should be corrected quickly.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Nanyang (77)</h3>
<p>June 5th, I visited the headmistress of the Girls' Vocational School, Li Shouying, a Hunan native, who has been in charge of this school for eight years. At a glance, one can tell she is an experienced educator. As Hunan is famous for its embroidery, Headmistress Li also promotes women's fine arts. However, Nanyang is completely Westernized, and the customs and environment are vastly different from China. All those who run education rely on the whims of capitalists. When capitalists arrive, the educationalists bustle about them. When capitalists leave, educators must walk and hurry about in the hot sun, which is quite difficult. Therefore, the best people in America mostly do not engage in education. Nowadays, young people are willing to join radical factions to overthrow everything and are unwilling to bow their heads to be slaves of capitalists, which is understandable. Although the schools here have principals, they cannot make decisions independently. Even if they want to hold a meeting and invite someone to give a lecture, they cannot do so without the approval of the so-called "Director," who is the school's boss. As for Rangoon, there might not even be a principal, only an "Education Director" placed under the Director. However, capitalists who also hold educational power have sufficient reasons. Some capitalists come from industry and commerce and, though illiterate, amass fortunes worth millions. Today's PhDs cannot earn a single penny, so they are despised by capitalists, who believe that education has no great value or is merely a waste of money. Therefore, the world's trend is that if adults cannot be taught to become capitalists, they will inevitably evolve into new youth who overthrow capital. It is difficult to remain neutral and teach people the so-called "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" and make them stick to it rigidly.</p>
<p>However, we should not blame the illiterate capitalists for enslaving and bossing around PhDs and scholars. Look at Zhang Zongchang, who also understood politics, and Chu Yupu, who once served as a university president. Those with power are omnipotent, and those with money are also omnipotent. The mere terms of politics, law, teaching, right and wrong are relegated to books! (As the saying goes, "What need does an old man have for poetry and books?") This has been the case since ancient times.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (318)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: In the Chamber, Tears Fall, Melancholy Red Emotions; In the Seat, Hearts Lean, Lingering Green Intentions</p>
<p>It turns out that this Green Intent, indeed, first appeared in the first section of this chapter. Let's not discuss for now how she degenerated into prostitution. Just her shy demeanor, not even daring to raise her head, was truly pitiful. But why was Zuo Shichen sitting across from her, staring blankly? According to Zuo Shichen, Green Intent's face was seventy percent similar to his already married sweetheart, Ruiyun. The upper half of her face, from her forehead to her nose, was exactly the same. The long bangs that were popular at that time covered her eyebrows, just like Ruiyun's. Their face shapes were both so-called "oval faces." Many women in the world have oval faces, so there's no need to dwell on that. But her beautiful, limpid eyes, protected by slightly thick eyelashes, although she lowered her brows and didn't dare to look elsewhere, her lively gaze naturally revealed itself, impossible to hide. Right in the center was a small, jade-like nose. These two parts were exactly like Ruiyun. Her mouth shape was also somewhat similar. When she smiled, her pearly teeth were even more beautiful than Ruiyun's. Ruiyun's teeth were also very neat, but they protruded slightly forward. Their height was also about the same. Of course, Ruiyun was slightly taller, naturally due to her age, and Green Intent hadn't fully developed yet. As for their waists, Ruiyun was much better than Green Intent. Zuo Shichen thought to himself that it was just as religious scholars said: humans were created by God. If that were the case, Ruiyun and Green Intent were at least based on the same model, with only slight changes. While Zuo Shichen stared intently at Green Intent, Green Intent had already noticed, but she didn't dare to glance at Zuo Shichen and avoided his gaze, turning her head frequently and deliberately talking to A-su. A-su was a very astute person. She had already seen Zuo Shichen frequently looking at Green Intent and knew that Green Intent was talking about irrelevant things to avoid Zuo Shichen's gaze. She patted Long Ziyun's shoulder and said, "Second Master Zuo is calling for whose turn to sing now?" Long Ziyun replied, "He's just calling randomly, nothing definite," and then said to Zuo Shichen, "Do you think this little girl looks like someone?" Zuo Shichen nodded and said, "I noticed she looked like someone as soon as she came in." Ling Zhixiang was preoccupied with entertaining the guests he had brought and didn't pay much attention. At this point, Lin Fanzi, who was waiting for Lu Qingyun, who hadn't arrived yet, tapped the drum and said, "Shichen, you can switch seats." Zuo Shichen quickly said, "No, no. Isn't it the same sitting across from her?" Long Ziyun, without asking why, had already grabbed a gambling ticket and said, "Let's force it. How should we write it?" She handed it to A-su. A-su said, "Little sister, what does it matter who we call? Little sister, sit next to Second Master Zuo. Fourth Master, I'll keep him company." Under her direction, Green Intent, blushing with shyness, sat next to Zuo Shichen.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial and Gold Market Turns to a Weak Path</h3>
<p>Following the trend of initial flourishing turning to withering, yesterday, the 19th, the gold price suddenly turned sluggish. It rose in the morning, weakened at noon, and was mediocre in the afternoon. The total trading volume for the day was only around seven taels. Looking back at the changes, they are unpredictable. Overall, the reasons are complex, and the psychology of the industry is firm and then weak. All buying and selling is not very enthusiastic, and the transactions are different. In the previous market, Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Xing, Yong Yi, Fengyong, etc., all bought in, while Fuchang, Xieyu, Zhifengyong, etc., all sold. Chenfengyong and Yuancheng Yong, etc., bought and then sold. The overseas silver market was also low, and the United States continued to sell. Therefore, the market opened with a rise, once even reaching the 90 tael mark. Afterwards, it suddenly turned downward, probably due to rumors that India was going to open a world silver market relief conference. This led to hopes that the silver price might rise, and Fuchang and others competed to sell, causing panic. Thus, the market turned soft. However, the foreign exchange rate narrowed by half a cent, while the internal rate went the opposite way. By noon, the gold price had fallen by five or six taels, almost reaching the point of getting worse and worse. Later, the market became quiet, with only a little over one tael of rise and fall, hovering around 84 taels. Because it was Wednesday, there was no market for drafts, and the large bars this morning might rebound by one-sixteenth, pending verification.</p>
<p>The rising trend was just a flash in the pan. In the morning, the opening price for the January gold standard was 588 taels and 5 mace, an increase of 1 tael and 6 mace (the gross price was over 7 taels to over 8 taels; Yuan Maoyong, etc., were the first to sell and then buy). The large bars and silver prices had fallen by one-eighth. Later, because Chenfengyong and others still had a strong desire to buy, the price suddenly jumped to 90 taels and 2 mace. Mitsui Shanghai, etc., once sold January British gold at 171875, and Wah Bi absorbed December US dollars at $38.875. Afterwards, Yuancheng Yong, Yuchang Xieyu, etc., sold out, especially as there was news from abroad that the silver price was being maintained, so the 90 tael mark was immediately broken. It had fallen to 88 taels and 8 mace. When the first order was posted, it was raised slightly by 5 or 6 mace to 89 taels and 3 mace. The first order had narrowed by a full 1.25, and Citibank had narrowed by 0.25 to a daily gold increase of 0.75, but it was not moved and instead tended to decline. In reality, people's hearts were not good, and Fuchang and other large firms sold out, and the internal market was also not tight. HSBC once sold January British gold at 171875, and banks also traded recently, both at 1875. After 10 o'clock, it dropped to 86 taels and 8 mace. Afterwards, Yuanxing Yong and retail investors bought in, and it improved by one tael to 7 taels and 8 mace. However, the draft showed a loosening trend. Maihang issued December at 1725, and banks made against February at 173125. Furthermore, Fuchang and others unwound their positions and gradually lowered the price by two taels and several cents. At 11 o'clock, it was 85 taels, and it rose slightly by one tael and a fraction, totaling 6 taels, 2 or 3 cents. Retail investors and others chased the price, and Zhengjin absorbed March British gold at 17375. Soon after, Zhifengyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, etc., jointly tended to sell, so the price was still in a weak state, falling by more than two taels. At 11:45, it was only 83 taels and 9 mace. After a while, it added 5 or 6 mace. At the noon close, it was 4 taels and 1 mace, and it was done again at around 4 taels. The posted price had been changed to 622 taels and 2 mace because the daily gold was listed at a large 0.75, the initial deposit was 33 or 34 taels, and at noon, it was 38 taels.</p>
<p>The market was quiet and bleak. The opening price for the afternoon market was 84 taels and 7 mace because Fuchang and others immediately entered, and it was heard that the Indian exchange rate was reported as Xiao Er An, followed by 4 taels and 9 mace. Hengxing sold out, so it retreated to 1 tael, 8 or 9 mace. After 2:10, the price fluctuated by 8 or 9 cents from time to time, hovering around 4 taels. However, the transaction was scattered. Soon after, retail investors bought in, rising to 4 taels and 8 mace. Suddenly, Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, etc., all came to sell, and it depreciated by more than 1 tael. Around 3:30, it suddenly became 83 taels and 4 mace. In a short time, there seemed to be many buyers on the table, and it rose again by one tael, but it advanced and retreated quickly, with several cents lurking. After 4 o'clock, Xinhong had some dragging in, causing it to be pulled up by 3 or 4 cents to 84 taels and 4 mace, and then 1 or 2 cents were reduced. By the time it closed at 4:30, it was 84 taels and 2 mace, a drop of 2 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 90 taels and 2 mace, and the minimum price was 83 taels and 4 mace, a difference of 6 taels and 8 mace. The posted price was a deposit of 37 or 38 taels.

<h3>There Is Another Saying That Maoye Banknotes Will Be Redeemed</h3>

The gentleman said that this case is currently being planned as a whole. He also said that the one-yuan banknotes of Maoye Bank that are circulating among the people will be redeemed at the end of the lunar year last year.

<h3>Securities Reorganization Fell More Than One Yuan Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the securities market, the transaction situation of each bond, the buying and selling of the futures market, was not deserted, but the spot goods were still rare. In recent weeks, the various bonds have been rising significantly one after another, and it seems that the rising trend has come to a temporary end. The situation of the buyers has gradually become disorganized, and the selling air has taken over the upper hand. The bond price has dropped due to excess supply, but the trend is still flat. As a result, the recent overall decline in the whole six was as high as one yuan and six corners, and the next month's period and the reorganized futures also fell by more than one yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Lacks Energy</h3>
<p>The yarn market is extremely deserted, really because the general trend is not prosperous. The demand for domestic present yarn is cold, and all gangs have no energy to compete. As a result, the bottom goods have increased, and people's hearts are very weak. The Japanese merchants are throwing rewards very much. The Chao gang's attitude is calm and there is no intention of scraping empty. Only the new users are more lacking because the bottom market is too dry. Judging from the general trend of the yarn market, there is still little optimism.</p>
<p>The human mark is plain. The human mark market opened in the early market with a lack of sellers in the market, and the market was still plain. Each month rose by 2 or 3 cents. At 2 or 3 disks, the market was loose again due to the lack of three qualities. As a result, the recent rise was 1 or 2 cents, and the far was flat. The afternoon market was even more tired, with recent drops of 2, 4, and 5 cents, and far drops of 1 cent. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 6,150 packages. It was found that Yi Yu bought in 800 packages, the same as 400 packages, Yuan De 350 packages, and the remaining 2,200 packages. Mao Ji sold 500 packages, Rong Xing 350 packages, Tian Long 350 packages, and the remaining 2,300 packages. The closing price is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Flat in the Morning, Loose in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and fell in the afternoon, really because the world cotton industry is weak and American cotton has fallen again. Only the Shanghai gang cotton merchants are still in this month's tightening of the squeeze, but the general situation is still soft. The spot cotton transactions in the factories are silent. The futures cotton market price is cheaper. The same type of standard flower is only sold for 31 taels and 5 cents. In addition, the yarn market has recovered and is not strong. The incoming goods from various roads are still not smooth, so it can only be maintained for a while.</p>
<p>The result of the Han mark is lazy. Although American cotton fell when the Han mark market opened in the early market, people's hearts were still hard. In order to tighten the multi-head in this month, 2 or 3 disks rose slightly by 5 cents. The closing was slightly flat. As a result, the rise was 5 cents to 1 cent. In the afternoon, two manufacturers came out to enter near and far. The market suddenly loosened, with each falling by 1 or 2 cents. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 36,500 loads. It was found that Shenchang bought 2,200 loads, Mao Ji 2,300 loads, and the remaining 1,5700 loads. Tong Yu sold 1,500 loads, Yuanda 1,400 loads, and the remaining 1,1200 loads. The closing price is listed on the left.

<p>The cotton invitation has no major development. The current cotton business still has no large amount of development. The sources are estimated to be 1,000 packages of Yao flower and 950 packages of Tong flower. In particular, Shaanxi flower 35.00, Su Lun Factory entered 700 pieces of spot warehouse delivery and another 16.00, Su Lun Factory entered 700 pieces of spot warehouse delivery, and Xiasha flower 31.60 2.20. The same industry entered 300 packages, and also and also.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Flower Enter a Tired Situation Again</h3>
<p>American cotton broke the 1-cent mark again. Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first due to good news from Liverpool, but tired later due to the conclusion of the long position and the sale of Wall Street. It is estimated that futures fell 10 to 4 pounds of sound, and spot fell 10 pounds of sound. British cotton futures fell 2 or 3 points, and spot rose 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 15 points. The Indian cotton market was firm and stable. The Japanese merchants bought in, and it is estimated that Pingguoer rose 1 rupee, and Aomula and Bairoxi rose 2 rupees.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Sales Stagnate and Turn Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the amount of grain arriving at Zhabei from various sources was not large, with only a dozen or so establishments. Sales in the main street were extremely stagnant. Both new and ordinary grades of japonica rice fell by two dimes. Top-grade japonica rice opened at $15.30, with extremely quiet buying interest. The market sentiment was bearish, so the situation was particularly unfavorable. Although the supply of early rice was meager, the turnover was very slow, also falling back by one and a half dimes. Top-grade early rice opened at $14.30. Yangdu glutinous rice was affected by the sluggishness of japonica rice and turned weak. Near the end of the day, transactions turned lukewarm. Large quantities opened at around $13. The price of rice from Shanghai port remained unchanged, with no noticeable changes. Top-grade rice was still at the $15 mark, while mid- and lower-grade rice were sufficiently available. Currently, wholesale sales are unsatisfactory and it's difficult to have a good outcome. Sales for all stalls throughout the day were poor. About ninety boats are currently moored down the river.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the amount of grain arriving at Shanghai South Wharf successively totaled more than twenty establishments. Top-grade japonica rice from regular sources was scarce, firmly opening at $15. Ordinary mid-grade rice fell back by approximately two dimes. Rice from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces became increasingly difficult to sell, falling slightly by two or three dimes. High-priced rice reluctantly opened at $13. Green-tipped rice from Southern suppliers such as Sijing was in abundant supply, but sales were sluggish. Existing stocks were sufficient, and prices suddenly fell by small amounts of three or four dimes. Top-grade rice opened at $13.50. The supply of Yangxian glutinous rice remained scarce, and retail sales of Dujian rice were still acceptable, with the situation being average. Large quantities opened at around $12. Ordinary-grade rice saw slightly brisker sales, with a slight movement from outside suppliers. Top-grade rice opened at the $13 mark, with the situation being stable.</p>
<h3>New Orders for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of foreign rice was meager, with some suppliers intending to slightly increase prices, but without definite plans. However, due to the difficulty in procuring Dujian rice under the local regulations, attention was still focused on foreign rice, so the market remained relatively stable. However, the sales of mid- and lower-grade rice were sluggish due to the suspension of trading by various suppliers, so all grades of mid- and lower-grade rice showed a slight decline. Overall market transactions included more than two hundred bags of early Jiangxi machine-milled rice, priced at $10.04 to $10.10, and two hundred bags of Hunan machine-milled rice, priced at $13.15 to $13.10. Two hundred and ten bags of Nanjing brown rice were priced at $8.89. Foreign rice has not arrived for a long time, and existing stocks are exhausted, with a lack of incoming shipments. However, recently, due to the increase in the price of Dujian rice, foreign rice has also not seen the arrival of high-priced goods. Some merchants have once again ordered foreign rice, with two batches of cargo to be loaded soon, consisting of No. 1 Saigon rice, priced at 5.50 to 5.40 taels per hundred catties. Over thirty thousand bags of Japanese rice that had arrived previously have not been cleared through customs due to certain reasons, and the cost is high, making it unprofitable when compared to the Shanghai price. Recently, as the Shanghai rice price has increased, it has gradually become profitable, so the Japanese merchant has been in contact with rice merchants to discuss sales methods.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Under the Domination of Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Prices for all months sharply declined again by two or three cents. Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months declined sharply again, as foreign wheat prices had fallen sharply again. Chicago prices fell by only three cents for near-term contracts and one dollar for long-term contracts, while the trend in Canada was even more pronounced, with near-term prices reported at only around 5.7 cents, a drop of 1.6 cents compared to the previous day. The sharp decline was unexpected, causing the market atmosphere to follow the deterioration of international markets, putting people in a miserable state. Throughout the day, the liquidation of long positions and the pressure of short positions holding foreign wheat were extremely heavy, with buyers having little power to reverse the situation. As a result, the opening prices for all months continued to fall. In the end, the current month fell by two cents compared to the previous day, December fell by 2.75 cents, January fell by three cents, February fell by two cents, March fell by 2.5 cents, and April fell by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market: A Bleak Outlook Both Domestically and Internationally</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months tended towards a bleak outlook due to the sharp decline in foreign wheat prices. Considering the rebound from the previous day due to the increase in foreign wheat prices, the market sentiment towards foreign wheat was naturally soft. Furthermore, it was heard that several grain merchants had set the price of Canadian No. 3 wheat at only 4.07 taels and No. 2 Australian wheat at only 4.2 taels. Once these prices were fixed, they were then dumped on the exchange, causing near and far-term contracts to fall. Judging from this, with foreign wheat remaining cheap, it is difficult to be optimistic about the market situation. As a result, the current month fell by five cents compared to the previous day, December fell by four cents, January fell by five cents, February and March fell by four cents, and April fell by five cents. Spot wheat also tended to be flat and soft. The entire city opened with 3,000 bags of Zhenjiang wheat priced at 3.6 taels.</p>
<h3>The Source of Zhabei Copper Coins (Paoyuan) Has Stopped Loading</h3>
<p>The number of copper coins (paoyuan) that arrived from Quanzhou in the previous Hua Yuanyuan and Yuan'an rounds was relatively large. Due to the sluggish market and the downward trend in sentiment, although quoted prices have not fallen, market prices have become extremely chaotic, with people competing to sell at low prices, even disregarding costs and incurring losses. Considering that all of these Quanzhou coins were purchased by customers at high prices and unwilling to sell at low prices, after repeated correspondence, they all insisted on holding firm. Yesterday, news was heard from the merchants that later ships had decided to stop loading altogether in order to promote a turnaround in the Shanghai market. If so, the opening price in the future market should not be too low.</p>
<h3>Seafood Golden Hook Shrimp Tails Rebound After Price Drops</h3>
<p>The previous shortage of golden hook shrimp tails had caused the market price to rise continuously due to customer demand exceeding supply. Recently, according to Hong Kong telegraphs, the new goods were gradually coming out of the water, and the production price was gradually easing. The Shanghai side reported a drop in production market prices and a surge in supplies, causing the market to soften for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that the Guangbang Shunli company was selling large-sized, high-quality goods at a price of 116 taels, and unified goods at 112 taels to 109.5 taels. After hearing this, various merchants believed that large quantities would arrive and took a cautious approach, resulting in very careful handling. Of the twenty-seven boxes that arrived at the company, less than half were sold, and the remaining goods were not sought after.</p>
<h3>The Decline in Piece Goods (Dongpi) Has Not Ended</h3>
<p>Since last week, the local machine-made cloth market has not been good, especially fine cloth and fine materials, which have been particularly poor. The reason is that the previous price increase was too severe, and the increase in current goods naturally led to a decline. By yesterday, the decline had stopped because the Guangdong, Shantou, and Xiamen suppliers were gradually becoming active, and people's sentiment was slightly better. Tanghe fine cloth was sold for 6.5 taels, the same price as the blue Shuangyu (Double Fish) trumpet, and the Caiqiu (Colored Ball) was 6.55 taels. The blue Feiyu (Flying Fish) was 6.9 taels, and the blue Ji (Chicken) was 6.35 taels. The blue Ri (Sun) had no goods, and the fine Xiyanghe (Slanting Sun Crane) returned to 6.875 taels, and the blue Shuangyu (Double Fish) was 6.775 taels. Among the coarse cloth, 11-pound goods were softer than before. The three cats and three rabbits were both 4.75 taels. 9-pound cloth rose by five cents, and 16-pound goods were relatively scarce.</p>
<p>The decline in Dongyang goods has not ended in recent days, and the velvet goods market is even more lifeless. With the exception of colored striped velvet, double-width thick flower velvet cotton French velvet, almost all other goods have declined, especially white velvet, which has fallen the most. 22.5 months were sold for 7.15 taels yesterday, and 24 train heads were 7.8 taels. 26 spot goods are relatively scarce. Yuehua velvet large flowers were mostly sold for 1.95 cents yesterday, and medium and small flowers were 1.875 cents. Only Fuhua medium flowers required 1.925 cents. Colored check velvet fell to 2 cents, and printed velvet fell sharply. As the arrival of fine serge gradually increased, it also turned downwards. In addition, local products were increasingly abundant, so the market was very weak yesterday. Sanyou (Three Friends) colored opened at 2.95 cents, Huxinting (Mid-Lake Pavilion) was 3 cents, and Huanle (Happy) was 2.975 cents. Gray Guangxie (Gray Light Slant), colored Zigong (Zigong), new flower Zhigongni (Zhigong Woolen Cloth) were consistently sluggish. Shuilang velvet slightly turned around, and foreign red label spot goods were out of stock.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: Russian Sales of Tea Alone Are Thriving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local market for foreign tea was characterized by a strong interest from foreign firms in Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, but these firms have recently been offering increasingly harsh prices, causing tea merchants to suffer heavy losses. Items such as Zhenmei and Zhucha remain sluggish, and the largest market, Morocco, has previously been difficult to sell due to abundant existing stocks. Now, due to poor agricultural harvests and tight finances, tea sales are even more reduced. As a result, the market price of Zhenmei has been gradually declining, but sales remain sluggish. The future of the tea market is extremely bleak.</p>

<h3>Results of Population Survey in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>A total of 1,007,868 people. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, after conducting a population survey in the settlement on the 22nd of last month, has completed the calculation by the Revenue Department. There are a total of 1,007,868 Chinese and foreign male and female residents, an increase of 167,642 people compared to the 840,226 people surveyed five years ago. Among them, Chinese residents account for 971,397 people, an increase of 161,118 people compared to the 810,279 people five years ago. In terms of their original home province, there are a total of nineteen provinces. Jiangsu residents are the most numerous, reaching 505,576 people, followed by Zhejiang residents, with 304,544 people. Guangdong residents rank third, but there are only 44,502 people, which is a large disparity compared to the number of people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with a ratio of no less than ten to one. Furthermore, in the International Settlement, there are more men than women by more than half, while the number of children is about the same as the number of women. There are 437,300 Chinese men, only 287,091 women, and 253,388 children. There are 36,471 foreigners in the International Settlement, an increase of 6,524 people compared to the 29,947 people surveyed five years ago. According to the first population survey in the International Settlement sixty years ago, there were only 1,666 foreigners at that time. After forty-five years, it increased more than tenfold to 18,519 people, and in the most recent fifteen years, it has doubled again. However, when surveyed in 1925, there were nationals from forty-four countries. This time, there are only nationals from forty-three countries because one Cuban person left Shanghai three years ago and has not returned. Currently, the largest number of foreigners are Japanese, accounting for more than half of the total, with 18,478 people. British people account for about one-third of the Japanese, with 6,221 people. Russians rank third, with 3,487 people. Indian people rank fourth, with 1,842 people. Americans have dropped to fifth place with only 1,608 people, a decrease of 334 people compared to five years ago.

He has now returned to Shanghai to carry out the preparations.</p>
<h3>Outcome of Silk Factory Mediation</h3>
<p>The capital side will sign a draft agreement today to supplement it. The Shanghai silk factories previously suspended operations due to sluggish sales and losses. Later, Chairman Shen of the Silk Factory Association persuaded the businesses to prioritize the livelihoods of workers and find ways to resume operations. At that time, thirty-two factories agreed to make an effort to start work and agreed to reduce wages to ease the burden, and each factory separately summoned employees to inform them of the difficulties of reducing wages to resume work. Fortunately, they were able to gain the understanding of the employees. Twenty-odd silk factories in districts such as Zhabei and Xinzha resumed work one after another. However, a minority of workers at the nine silk factories in the Hongkou district that were preparing to start work opposed the wage cut, causing a labor-capital dispute. The police station detained Chen Zhongxiang, a member of the standing committee of the Hongkou District Workers' Union, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau failed to resume work. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs stated that the foreign silk market was in extreme decline and that labor and capital were both in extreme positions, which was not a good thing for the workers. On the afternoon of the 18th, it summoned factory representatives Shen Xichen, Huang Jinfan, and Zhang Peishen, and labor representatives Fei Fengtai, Yao Zilan, Yu Fang, Wang Jianhao, Xi Jing, Shen Bingkun, Chen Xiupu, Xu Pengnian, Zhang Chun Gu, and seven other representatives to a mediation meeting at the Bureau. The meeting was chaired by Wang Bing, a staff member of the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Zhong Quan, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters. As a result of the mediation, workers' wages were calculated at 85% of the original wage, and silkworm moth subsidies remained the same. A draft agreement was immediately drawn up, and the representatives of both labor and capital were instructed to sign it. The capital representatives had to seek the consent of their colleagues before signing the supplement. Yesterday (the 19th) at 3 pm, the Shanghai Silk Factory Association convened a discussion meeting of representatives from the twenty-two factories that were starting work. The Bureau of Social Affairs sent representative Wang Bing to attend and provide guidance. Chairman Shen reported on the proceedings of the mediation meeting attended by the Bureau of Social Affairs and asked for a public decision. Everyone felt that the silk market was in extreme stagnation, and the small factories selling silk bales were losing more than 300 taels of silver. Colleagues were about to go bankrupt, and the efforts to resume work were purely to maintain the livelihood of the workers. The factory's raw materials, dried cocoons, etc., were mortgaged to the bank, and the bank was now acting as a commercial bank to issue wages and start machines to spin silk, so the temporary wage reduction was a last resort, but the workers did not understand and insisted on increasing wages. Currently, Chinese silk sales to Europe are not moving, and stocks of silk are still heavy. No one is asking for advice, and the factory is willing to close down and perish together. Chairman Shen repeatedly persuaded them and told them the hard work of this official mediation, urging them to respect the intentions of the superiors and not go too far. The representatives reluctantly agreed to follow the procedure. It was decided that tomorrow (the 20th), Chairman Shen would still be sent to the Bureau of Social Affairs to sign the draft agreement and ask for the issuance of a notice detailing the circumstances of the workers' new wages being calculated at 85% of the original wage, the silkworm moth promotion worker being paid as usual, and female workers being paid 50 cents per day to comply with the agreement. After the meeting, it was already 8 pm. It was found that Chen Zhongxiang, who was detained by the Public Security Bureau, was released by the Public Security Bureau after the Bureau of Social Affairs telegraphed the Public Security Bureau after the draft agreement was formulated by the Bureau of Social Affairs the day before. Chen was released around 6 pm, and the workers welcomed him back to the association by car. The female workers of the Jinlun Double Palace Silk Factory on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei mistakenly believed that the Jinlun Double Palace Silk Factory would also follow the example of the reduced wages of the Dan Palace Silk Factory. The day before yesterday (the 18th) was the day when the factory issued wages, so the female workers went on strike in a united manner when they went to work. By 2 pm, the strike had spread to the Honglun, Xinlun, Dalun, and Lunlun five Double Palace Silk Factories. After the factory sent personnel to explain to the female workers that wages would not be reduced, the misunderstanding was resolved. Yesterday (the 19th) morning, the Jinlun and other two Double Palace Silk Factories had already resumed work, and the remaining three factories could also resume their original state this morning.</p>
<h3>Chongguang Returns to Shanghai and Speaks</h3>

<h3>Petition to Negotiate Relief from the New US Tariff</h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stating that the newly revised US tariff increased the tax rates on egg products, cowhide lace, and other products shipped from our country, which greatly affected foreign trade. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau specially convened a meeting with the leaders of the relevant industries to discuss relief measures. A number of opinions were decided. The Bureau believes that the implementation of these measures should be submitted to the Ministry for review and approval. Yesterday, a special document was submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the relevant clauses on the egg industry and lace industry be consulted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and telegraphed to the US ambassador to negotiate with the US government to maintain the industry. The original text states (For the sake of submitting a petition for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to approve the dispatch of a letter from the Industrial and Commercial Survey Bureau, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered that the affairs concerning the new US tariff be directly and separately consulted with the commodity inspection bureaus in various places. After careful study, please reply, etc., and attach the original paper to the bureau for approval. It is hereby checked that the export commodities currently inspected by the bureau's offices are cotton, livestock, primary and secondary products, raw silk, tung oil, etc. After carefully reviewing the new American 1930</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>revised tariff increased the tax rates on egg products, cowhide lace, and other products shipped from our country, which greatly affected foreign trade. Therefore, on October 23, the Industrial and Commercial Survey Bureau convened a meeting with the leaders of the egg product, cowhide, and lace industries at the Bureau to discuss relief measures. At that time, in addition to the fact that many cowhide merchants did not send representatives and there was no way to discuss, the egg merchants said that the new US tariff increased the tax on fresh eggs by two cents per dozen, and the tax on whole eggs and wet frozen egg yolks and egg whites by five cents per pound. According to the total number of exports to the United States in the past, the annual loss was about US$66,460. If the egg merchants in our country do not take measures to provide relief, it is feared that their business will decline day by day. The relief methods decided were divided into two categories: (A) For domestic issues: 1. Water and land transport should provide egg merchants with special convenience. 2. The local egg tax should be changed to a general tax or collected by the export customs at one time. 3. It is necessary to encourage chicken farming and improve chicken breeds as a fundamental relief. (B) For foreign issues: 1. Please ask the government to ask the US Tariff Commission to restore the old tax rate. 2. If the above request is not approved by the United States, please inspect all food imported from the United States, and please ask the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to increase the import tax on food imported from the United States separately. The lace merchants said that the US import tax value of various kinds of lace embroidery in our country is 90 per cent. The tax rate is too high. The reason for increasing the tax is to protect domestic commodities. Now, the United States does not produce handmade lace embroidery, and it does not compete with American machine-made products, so there is no need to protect them. Moreover, most of the handmade lace embroidery exported from China is for ordinary clothes and household use such as poor curtains and table carpets, which are not comparable to luxury goods, and there is no reason to increase the heavy tax to show restrictions. It is proposed to submit opinions to the US government based on the above opinions and request a reduction. Bureau Chief Dunmu found that the above opinions have been agreed upon and should be submitted to the Ministry for review and approval. In addition to the relief measures for the egg industry, all domestic matters should be transferred to the Ministry of Finance, Communications, and Railways for handling. For foreign matters concerning the egg industry and lace industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be consulted and telegraphed to the US ambassador to negotiate with the US government to maintain the industry. It is indeed a matter of public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Kong, Vice Minister Zheng Mu</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Constructs Vehicle Ferry</h3>
<p>Requires 4 million yuan. Minister of Railways Sun Ke considered that the direct intermodal transport on the Jinpu, Jinghu, and Hangyong lines was often blocked by the waterway between Pukou and Xiaguan, causing delays in passenger and freight traffic due to loading and unloading. Therefore, he specially commissioned Zheng Hua, a technician from the Ministry, to prepare for vehicle ferry measures. The preparations have been completed and construction of wharves and laying of ferry tracks will begin soon on both sides of the Yangtze River in Xiaguan and Pukou. According to this design, it is still an original innovation in China. Its efficiency will enable the intermodal transport vehicles to be transported from the land track to the track laid on the ship, and then the ship will transport them to the other side, where they will be towed by a locomotive to their destination without having to change cars or unload. The construction cost is set at 4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Experiences Strike Wave</h3>
<p>All Industries Stop Loading Goods for Shanghai; Both Sides Persist; Passenger and Freight Traffic in Wenzhou is Currently Congested. Unexpectedly, the Attempt to Increase Taxes Leads to a City-Wide Commercial Strike. A Report on this Matter is as Follows:</p>
<p>Merchants Oppose Tax Increase: The Wenzhou Tax Office Announced Increased Tax Rates on All Exported Goods and Notified the Chamber of Commerce to Implement Them on a Specific Date. All Merchant Guilds Believed that Business had Declined This Year. The Local Authorities are Seeking to Restore Businesses and it is Approaching the End of the Year When All Industries are Busy Preparing Goods. They were Unable to Bear this New Tax Rate and Requested an Exemption. However, the Tax Office Rejected the Request, Stating that the Regulations Were Established and Could Not be Changed.</p>
<p>All Goods Stop Loading: Wenzhou Passenger Guilds, Believing that the Request to Exempt Tax Rates was Ineffective, Jointly Implemented a Stop to Reporting and Loading Goods from the 16th to Maintain the Cost of Goods and to Achieve the Purpose of their Petition, as a Final Firm Expression. Therefore, Since This Week, No Goods Destined for Shanghai Have Been Loaded in Wenzhou, and Not a Single Item Has Arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting Measures: Yesterday, a Telegram from Wenzhou Stated that Since Industries Refused Taxes and Went on Strike, They Convened a Joint Meeting of All Merchant Guilds at the Chamber of Commerce on the 18th to Discuss Insisting on Achieving the Goal of Suspending the Tax Increase Before Resuming Reporting and Exporting Goods. Yesterday, Deliberations Were Still Underway.</p>
<p>Steamships Travel Back and Forth Empty: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wenzhou Route Vessel, the Guangji, Arrived in Ou When All Industries Experienced a Strike Wave. With No Goods to Load, the Shipowner Telegraphed Shanghai to Inquire Whether to Maintain the Schedule. The Shanghai Office Telegraphed Back Stating that This Vessel Was a Regular Scheduled Ship and Must Operate as Scheduled, Even if it Sailed Empty. Therefore, the Shipowner Telegraphed Again Yesterday, Stating that All Goods Had Stopped Loading and Only an Empty Ship Was Returning to Shanghai. Fearing the Dangers of Navigation, Mud and Sand Were Purchased to Fill the Hold to Stabilize the Ship and it Would Return to Shanghai. The Strike Wave Was Very Fierce.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Appeals on Behalf of the Tobacco Industry</h3>
<p>Please Order the Release of Detained Tobacco Leaves: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Based on a Report from the Tobacco Leaf Trade Association, States That Various Tobacco Merchants Purchased Tobacco Leaves in Xuzhou and Transported Them to Hankou, Where They Were Unjustifiably Detained. The Chamber of Commerce Has Telegraphed the Ministry to Appeal. The Original Text is Reproduced Below: To the Respected Ministers of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing: According to a Report from the Tobacco Leaf Trade Association, Tobacco Merchants Purchased Tobacco Leaves in Xuzhou and Transported Approximately Six Thousand Cartloads to Hankou. The Tax Was Paid to the Xuzhou Bureau, and Procedures Were Completed. However, Due to a Dispute Between Bureau Chief Xu and Chief Hu, the Goods Were Detained and Falsely Accused of Tax Evasion. The Tobacco Leaves Are Damp, and After Being Exposed to Wind and Rain, They Are Moldy. The End of the Lunar Year is Approaching, and Financial Resources Are Tight. Market Prices Are Falling Rapidly, and Time is of the Essence. If the Goods Are Not Unloaded Upon Arrival, the Railway Bureau Will Charge Extension Fees. Please Telegraph the Ministry to Appeal. The Tobacco Merchants Completed the Procedures for Loading and Paying Taxes. The Matter is Due to a Dispute Between Officials Xu and Hu, Which Has Affected the Merchants. It is Requested That the Hankou Tax Bureau Be Telegraphed to Release the Goods Immediately. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Bows in Respect.</p>
<h3>Rice Ships Arrive Continuously</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Fall Step by Step: Most of the Rice in Shanghai Comes from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi. Recently, with the New Rice Coming onto the Market, the Supply in Shanghai is Plentiful, and Market Prices are Gradually Loosening. The Price of Medium-Grade New Rice Has Reached Eleven Yuan and Several Jiao, Compared to the Peak Price of Twenty-Two or Twenty-Three Yuan, and There is a Difference of More Than Ten Yuan Between High-Grade and Low-Grade Goods. However, Although Market Prices are Lower, Sales Remain Very Slow. Therefore, There is an Increasing Accumulation of Rice Ships in the Port, and Some Rice Ships that Arrived a Week Ago Have Not Yet Been Sold. In Recent Days, the Number of Rice Ships Arriving Has Increased Even More, Reaching Forty or Fifty per Day. However, Farmers in Various Producing Areas Have Heard That Market Prices in Shanghai Are Low and Fear Further Declines. Therefore, They Have Transported the Rice to Towns and Cities for Sale. The Previous Batch of Rice Ships That Transported Rice to Shanghai Remained Stationary. They Were Only Able to Stock Up. Rice Businesses in Various Producing Areas Were Anxious to Sell the Rice in Shanghai Due to the Depressed Prices and Abundance of Goods. Therefore, in the Past Two Days, They Sent Letters to Rice Merchants in Shanghai Urging Them to Sell the Transported Rice as Soon as Possible So That the Rice Ships Could Return to Load More Goods. Recently, Rice Merchants Have Been Trying Their Best to Sell the Rice, but Transactions Are Only Sporadic.</p>

<h3>Stamp Duty Measures for Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses</h3>
<p>The Tobacco and Exchange Trade Association of This City Received a Letter Yesterday from the Jiangsu Province Shanghai Stamp Tax Bureau, Which Stated: We Are Writing to Inform You That the Stamp Duty for Tobacco and Alcohol Business Tax Licenses Should Be Affixed According to the Regulations. Later, An Order Was Received from the Ministry of Finance to Reduce the Duty to One Fen for Every Yuan of License Tax Paid. Calculated in This Way, the Maximum Amount to be Affixed is One Yuan. If the Tax Rate is Less Than One Yuan, It Will Also Be Calculated as One Yuan. After Receiving the Order, This Bureau Sent a Letter to the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office in the Second District to Inform the Tobacco and Alcohol Trade Associations. This Time, This Bureau Inspected the Stamp Duty, and According to the Report of the Inspectors, Most of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stores Complied with the Regulations and Affixed Stamps on the Licenses. Several Licenses Were Found Without Stamps Affixed and Detained by the Bureau. This Bureau Considered the Circumstances and Believed That the Number of Licenses Without Stamps in the Industry Was Relatively Small and Was Likely Due to Temporary Oversight. Considering That Most of the Tobacco and Alcohol Stores Were Small Businesses, They Should Be Treated Leniently. The Case Was Submitted to the Shanghai Bao Auditing Committee, Which Resolved That the Above-Mentioned Tax-Evading Licenses Would Be Temporarily Exempt from Punishment and Ordered to Be Stamped to Complete the Case to Show Compassion. This Bureau Has Ordered the Original Inspectors to Distribute the Above-Mentioned Licenses to the Respective Stores and Order Them to Be Stamped. As for the Temporary Receipts of the Business Merchants' Temporary Licenses, Which Were Not Items That Should Be Stamped, Several Were Mistakenly Taken to the Bureau by the Inspectors. After Investigation, It Was Found That There Were Only a Few Such Receipts, and They Had Already Been Ordered to Be Returned and the Inspectors Had Been Instructed Not to Detain Such Receipts Again to Avoid Misunderstandings. In Addition to Sending Separate Letters to the Sauce and Wine Shop Trade Association, We Are Writing to Inform You. We Hope That Your Association Will Take Note and Quickly Inform the Industry to Take Note Together. Thank You Very Much.</p>

<h3>Dispute over Boat Attendant Pushing Passenger into Water and Drowning on the Guangda Steamer</h3>
<p>Passengers at Wusongkou Make a Great Commotion; the Bureau Has Agreed to Punish the Culprit and Offer Compensation for Death: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangda steamer had a tragic incident on its voyage from Shanghai to Guangdong. A boat attendant pushed a passenger into the water, who drowned, causing a major dispute. Our reporter went to various parties to investigate and report on the situation.</p>
<p>Cause of the Tragedy: The China Merchants' Guangda steamer departed from Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 16th of this month, heading to Guangdong. There were about 700-800 passengers on board, all of whom were natives of Guangdong who had arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and were being sent back to Guangzhou. They had boarded the ship on the 15th. Before the ship departed on the morning of the 16th, the crew checked the passengers and found that many were traveling without tickets. The crew drove those who did not have tickets ashore. When the mooring cable was released and the ship was about to leave the port, a passenger ran from the shore, saying that he had gone ashore to buy some food. At that time, the ship had already moved. The passenger climbed onto the ship from the wooden posts inside the river along the dock. At this moment, there was an unusual clamor. A boat attendant saw the passenger climbing the posts and suspected that he was a ticketless passenger who had been expelled. He prohibited him from boarding the ship and pushed him violently. With a loud crash, the passenger fell into the water. The crew was busy with the departure procedures and did not have time to rescue him. The passenger who fell into the water drowned. It is said that the body was not recovered, so the name is unknown.</p>
<p>Passengers on the Ship Make a Commotion: After this incident occurred, the Guangda steamer continued to sail as usual. Some passengers on board who witnessed the incident were very indignant and negotiated with the crew. Soon, everyone on the ship knew about it. The crowd said, "We are here from Guangzhou as a group, why did you push our comrade into the river and drown him for no reason? We must order the shipowner to hand over the murderer!" Everyone on the ship shouted in unison, and there was a great disturbance on the ship. The shipowner was surrounded by the crowd and had no way to think. He had to stop the ship immediately at Wusongkou and immediately send a radio message to Shanghai, requesting the general bureau to send personnel to the ship to deal with the matter quickly.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bureau Sends Personnel to Investigate: Upon receiving the news, the Shanghai Bureau immediately ordered Liu Zhen, director of the South Dock Inspection Office, and others to investigate the truth of the case. Li, the General Manager, sent Shi to Wusong to mediate with the passengers on the Guangda steamer regarding the incident of the boat attendant beating a passenger, causing him to fall into the water and drown. The bureau promised to investigate the murderer and punish him severely. For the drowned passenger, the bureau promised to recover the body and provide compensation. Shi guaranteed on the spot that he would handle these two matters. Only after this guarantee was the public anger calmed, and the Guangda steamer was able to depart.</p>
<p>The Boat Attendant is Hung Up and Beaten for a Night: When the ship stopped at Wusong, the passengers on board searched for the murderer who pushed the person into the water. They mistakenly identified a boat attendant who set up a small goods shop on the Guangda steamer as the murderer. The passengers hung him up in the ship and beat him. The boat attendant was hung up for a night, and his whole body was injured. It wasn't until the morning of the 18th that the bureau staff came to the ship and stated that the murderer was not this person, but he was already covered in bruises.</p>
<p>The General Bureau Orders Investigation of the Culprit: General Manager Li has ordered Zhu Xingting, director of the Guangda business, to hand over the real murderer who pushed the person into the water so that he can be sent to the government for investigation. Because the ship has already departed, he telegraphed the ship's crew, telling them to take good care of the boat attendant (who seems to be named Xiaoxiazi, 小瞎子) who committed the crime and not let him escape, so that he can be detained and sent back to Shanghai when the ship returns.</p>
<h3>Various Groups Enthusiastically Support the Xiao Case</h3>
<p>After the Overseas Chinese Federation launched the Xiao Case Support Association, domestic groups responded one after another. Yesterday, the association received a letter from the China Women and Children Relief Association and a telegram from the Fujian Nan'an Shanghai Alumni Association, responding. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Reply from the China Women and Children Relief Association: We have received your letter regarding Ms. Xiao being slandered by a foreign barbarian and your launching of a meeting to provide assistance. Upon investigation, the barbarians are so violent that everyone with blood and qi hates them. We correspond to join your association and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Nan'an Shanghai Alumni Association: To the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Party Departments of all provinces, the governments of all provinces, and all domestic and foreign institutions, organizations, and newspapers: Ms. Xiao Xin'an was hired by the Peide School of the Anbon Island Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. She traveled from Shanghai on the Dutch Java Steamship Company's Zhibade ship. Her sincere concern for education is evident. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Makassar, she was forcibly raped by the Dutch deputy second officer. This beastly behavior not only insults Ms. Xiao's personal character, but also tarnishes our national image. All Chinese people are indignant. Furthermore, the destruction of women is difficult to tolerate in terms of human morality and justice. If serious negotiations are not conducted, overseas Chinese compatriots traveling back and forth will inevitably suffer such a calamity. We are willing, compatriots, to adhere to the spirit of the revolution and persist to the end in order to maintain personality and protect the country. The telegram is urgent.</p>
<h3>The Municipal and County Jointly Try the Assassin of Zhao</h3>
<p>Xia Shaoen, the criminal who murdered Zhao Tieqiao, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, was escorted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday to confront Wang Xiaosanzi, who had been captured earlier. Xia Shaoen, the murderer who assassinated Mr. Zhao Tieqiao, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, was captured by Shen Jinghua, Director of the County Public Security Bureau, and escorted to Shanghai after interrogation. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the county to bring him in because they had also captured a suspect, Wang Xiaosanzi, after the Zhao case occurred, and Wang and Xia had a collaborative relationship in order to hold a joint trial. At 9:00 AM yesterday, County Director Shen escorted the criminal Xia to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, where he was interrogated by Wang Yufen, Section Chief of the Third Division of the Bureau, together with Shen. At around 1:00 PM, he was escorted back to the county for detention. It is reported that the confession has proved that Xia and Wang were indeed accomplices. However, the two criminals still have places of blaming and shirking responsibility for the direct cause of Zhao's death. It is also reported that Chen and You are also accomplices with Xia and Wang. Therefore, the municipal and county bureaus are still cooperating in arresting accomplices, and the county has requested instructions from the provincial government to determine the handling of the agency in order to get to the bottom of the matter.</p>
<h3>Pirates Kidnap People for Ransom</h3>
<p>More than a dozen shipowners and crew members kidnapped; 500 yuan ransom for each person to Taizhou to redeem tickets: A large gang of Wen-Tai pirates, sixty or seventy people, with five or six pirate ships, have recently appeared in the Yawosha waters outside of Wusongkou. The ship crew Zhao Ganyou, Kong Azai, Chen Xiaode, and three others from the Ningbo liuwang ship Zhao Xiangxing and the sand ship Xindeli Chen Shunxing were kidnapped by the pirates the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the sand ship Jin Yongxing and Yang Taimao shipowners Jin Asheng and Yang A'e were kidnapped. Soon after, the Jinbaoxing and Ni Shunmao two sand ships were stolen. Three members of the ship's crew were kidnapped. Before leaving, the pirates told the sand ships that each person kidnapped would have to pay 500 yuan in cash to redeem their ticket at a certain place in Taizhou. After the pirates left, the Jin Yongxing and other four sand ships successively sailed to Songjiang to report to Senji and asked the tax office to find a way to rescue the kidnapped shipowner Jin Asheng and Yang A'e and three members of the ship's crew. Since the pirates were discovered, more than a dozen people have been kidnapped. As a result, ordinary fishing boats dare not sail alone.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers in the 100,000 Yuan Robbery Case to Be Transferred to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>They were previously involved in a kidnapping for ransom in Hangzhou, and the victim was brutally murdered. The Zhejiang Local Bank previously sent a staff member to escort two boxes of banknotes, totaling 200,000 yuan, from Hangzhou to Shanghai by train. After arriving in Shanghai, the staff member changed to a rickshaw to go to the Donglai Bank. On the way, 100,000 yuan was stolen. The detectives of the Old Zhabei Police Station, including You A'gen, successively captured many robbers. The robbers have been interrogated by the Special District Local Court and sentenced to imprisonment. However, among them, Wang Yang and Wang E, who were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment in various places, were found by the Public Security Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Capital to have previously kidnapped Yue Ren Li in Hangzhou and extorted a huge sum of money. Because the kidnapped person could not afford to raise the money, he was brutally killed and his body was abandoned. Although the body was found, the head was missing. Now that the two bandits, Wang and Wang, have been captured, Tang Shihou, the leader of the detective team, was dispatched with a document to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Tang submitted a petition to the Special District Court to transfer them, and the police station did not object. Chief Judge Zhou ordered the police to go to the Western Prison and bring Wang Yang and Wang E for interrogation. He approved the delivery of the incoming people to bring them back to the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3>A Strange Drama Over Property</h3>
<p>Gathering hooligans, grabbing the coffin lid, firing two shots to demonstrate: Zhang Jialin, a villager of Linqing Road, Yangshupu, had a sister-in-law, Zhang Yu, who was over sixty years old. Both of her sons died early. She recently fell ill and was very ill. She passed away the day before yesterday. The inheritance was only four bungalows, covering about six minutes of land, worth more than two thousand yuan. Jialin regarded the house as his close relative and had no closer relatives. So he had his sister-in-law’s body collected. When the funeral was about to be held at about 5 pm, his cousin Zhang Haihai arrived to compete for the inheritance. Jialin rebuked him for delusion. Haihai walked away and gathered twenty ruffians to rush in. The coffin lid was removed when he was about to leave and two shots were fired to demonstrate. At that time, there were two funeral cars at Zhang's house. The drivers Wang Cheng and Chuan Yunting saw this strange sight and drove the empty cars to report to the Yangshupu Police Station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Zhang Haihai and Pan Zhaoxiao. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for investigation. According to the plaintiff, the defendant was a distant cousin and had no right to inherit the deceased’s property. In addition, the bungalow left was mortgaged by my late brother Guicai. I redeemed it with my own funds and should be obtained by me. No one else could covet it. Haihai argued that when I was arguing with Jialin, a gun was fired suddenly outside the door. I didn’t instigate this. Pan then said that I was invited by Haihai and did not know that it was a dispute over property. The coffin lid was also carried by others. In the middle of the journey, I felt very heavy, so I abandoned it in the vegetable garden. It has now been found by the police. The referee Ge ordered the two defendants to be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Qingyun Lane Demolition Case in Hongkou Injures People</h3>
<p>Preliminary judgment......Permission to appeal: On September 10, due to the demolition of houses by Xing Dingcheng, a compradore leased by New Sassoon, and under direction of White Russians, injuring tenants Miao Shelai and Ye Chenglin in Qingyun Lane, Miao Shelai and others, the injured people, sued Xing Dingcheng in the Special District Court for redress. Ten shops along Chongming Road near the entrance of Qingyun Lane, such as Tao Tao Restaurant, Qifa Grocery Store, and Guangtai Rice Store, also supplemented their statements as plaintiffs, demanding that Xing Dingcheng compensate for the loss of more than 4,700 yuan. The case was heard by Judge Cheng Shangfeng and after five debates it was concluded at 2:30 pm the day before yesterday (Tuesday). Judge Cheng summoned both parties to the second criminal court and read out the judgment, saying (In the case of Miao Shelai and others accusing Xing Dingcheng of injury, because the evidence on the plaintiff's side is insufficient, the defendant Xing Chengcheng is declared not guilty and the request for compensation for losses is rejected. If you disagree, you can appeal within ten days). At that time, the plaintiff's lawyer requested that the defendant Xing Dingcheng still be handed over to the original Bao Tang during the appeal period. He was allowed to do so and then he announced the adjournment of the court.</p>
<h3>Mexico Prohibits Chinese from Entering</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau received instructions from the Municipal Government yesterday, approving the telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Mexican consulates, stating that the current overseas Chinese in Mexico are being treated harshly by the Mexican government, and recently the Mexican government has prohibited Chinese from entering. In addition to conducting strict negotiations in accordance with international practice, the Ministry has telegraphed the Ministry to transfer the message to the governments of all provinces and cities to instruct all licensing agencies to notify the Chinese in Mexico to temporarily stop going there and not take risks. It is very important to notify the Public Security Bureau to follow suit.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Guild Requests Changes to Tire Removal Fine Method</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday requesting adoption and implementation: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday: With regard to the matter of the Hua community following the establishment of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, various vehicles in the transportation sector were reorganized to seek the soundness of municipal administration. The association is a rickshaw business group, and as far as the capabilities of the vehicle businesses allow, it has always urged reorganization to assist in the progress of municipal administration. Regarding the tire removal fine, vehicle businesses hope that the tire removal is for repair purposes. If they are only ordered to pay a certain fine, it is not asked whether the vehicles are repaired or not. In addition, the licensing location is remotely located in the west area, and the vehicle owners' loss of round-trip licensing is often several times the fine. The idea of being considerate of the poor is not taken into account. The method of responsible repair is considered necessary for both public and private reasons. For a copy of the operation rickshaw penalty rules, please submit the situation and request the Municipal Government of Shanghai to revise it and allow the vehicle to be repaired at the time of tire removal, and then go to the nearby vehicle office to supplement the license, in order to maintain the business while organizing transportation. The spirit of hard work and other words, and a copy of the rickshaw operation penalty rules are attached. The association investigated the section of responsible tire removal and repair in the French Concession. Items 16, 17, and 18 of the first article of the penalty rules promulgated by the Municipal Government also have similar regulations, but the French Concession only requires tire removal and repair and does not add additional fines. The rules promulgated by the Municipal Government require both tire removal and fines and then repair. This is the difference. Comparing the two, tire removal is equivalent to ordering a temporary suspension of business for a few days, which seems to contain a penalty. It is not impossible to fine him again. This matter has been successfully handled in the French Concession of this city, and both the public and private sectors feel beneficial. It seems that it can be used as a model. It is specially requested that your bureau approve the decision and implement it in a public-spirited manner.</p>
<h3>Zhang Guibin's Tragic Death Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>It was reported that the deceased was careless. The driver Ding Deyuan was driving his car to the French Concession Aiduya Road at 1:30 pm on the 16th of this month and injured Jiangbei native Zhang Guibin, who died. The police reported to Judge Zhu Cheng to inspect and confirm that it was true. At that time, due to the absence of a corpse, Ding was ordered to bail for six months. If there is no corpse, he will be allowed to withdraw. The police brought Ding to the French Court for investigation. First, the head of the car office reported the previous situation, and then the police officer No. 502 testified that he saw the car driving from east to west and the deceased rushing across the road from south to north, causing the defendant to be unable to stop and injuring the deceased to death. However, the defendant's car was driving very slowly, and it was true that the deceased was careless. Chinese and Western officials judged that the deceased was careless and had nothing to do with anyone, and dismissed the case and released the defendant.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman's Fur Coat Case Judged</h3>
<p>The defendant was sentenced to six months in prison: A Russian woman previously lost clothing items, including a fur coat valued at 850 yuan, which was the most precious item. Ai Lishi Kao, a Russian woman from No. 13 Tangshan Road, bought it from a thief. The owner found it, reported it to the police, and the police arrested the Russian woman who received the stolen goods and sent them to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. It has been reported earlier that the case was heard by Judge Feng yesterday and the defendant was sentenced to six months in prison. Because the defendant refused to accept the sentence and applied for appeal, the court ordered the stolen goods to be temporarily stored in the police station.</p>
<h3>Female Worker Forced into Prostitution Case</h3>
<p>Chen A'mao was imprisoned for one year and two months: Hu Hongdi, a 17-year-old girl from Jiangwan, worked in the Xielong Yarn Factory on Qiwupu Road. At 10 am on August 30, Hu was walking near Xielong when she was seduced to Chen's house by Chen A'er, a Jiangbei native. She was insulted and then taken to a rented house on Huaji Road to live and forced into prostitution. Chen's wife A'mao monitored her. A'mao was extremely fierce and whipped her at every turn. She finally managed to write a letter to her brother Hu Qianqing for help. Her brother, who lived in Zhangjiazhai, came to Shanghai after receiving the letter. Because he did not know the door number where she lived, he had no way to visit. The day before yesterday evening, Hu Qianqing met Hongdi unexpectedly on Seward Road. At that time, it was already night, and A'mao was also accompanying Hongdi to pull customers there. Hu reported to the post guard No. 1858 and arrested the pimp and prostitute together to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Local Court for trial by Judge Feng Shide. According to Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, young female workers from various yarn factories in Yangshupu have been abducted and disappeared from time to time. It is likely that they were placed in remote places by abductors and forced into private prostitution. As in the case of the victim, the defendant should be severely punished. Then Hu Hongdi complained that she was playing on the road that day and met the defendant's husband. Because they were neighbors and had known each other for a long time, her husband said that the work in the yarn factory was very hard and wanted to recommend her to a wine shop, where she could get two yuan a day. She was seduced and then sent to the house on Huaji Road, which was the brothel set up by the defendant, and was forced into prostitution from then on. The woman Hu Tangshi also turned herself in, saying that Hongdi was her adopted daughter-in-law. Because my son Rongsheng is still studying, they have not yet married. I request to be given a certificate of custody. Chen A'mao confessed that Hongdi was familiar with my husband and that she was willing to be a prostitute. The money she earned at night was all taken by my husband. She denied the abuse. After the hearing, Judge Feng sentenced Chen A'mao to one year and two months in prison. Hongdi was taken back by Hu Qianqing.</p>
<h3>Lin-Gu Divorce Case Settled</h3>
<p>Lin Zhang, the wife of Lin Hongxing, a silversmith at No. 74 Panjia Lane, Chuanxin Street, Old North Gate, was born with only one daughter, Yue'e, who is now 23 years old. In the past, when she was 18 years old, Wang Yinhai and Hu A'he and others acted as matchmakers and married her to Gu Youcai as his wife. They got married on August 21 of the 14th year of the Republic. Lin Yue'e was still harmonious at the beginning of her marriage and once gave birth to a son who died of illness. Since Yue'e used the excuse to return to Ningbo on September 25 of last year (that is, the 18th year), she has never returned. Gu has repeatedly contacted her without success. Now Lin Yue'e has hired a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit in the Local Court, the reason being that she was abused and beaten by the defendant and that the defendant was suffering from mental illness. The defendant Gu Youcai also filed a defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the seventh court for trial. First, Lin Yue'e confessed that she was 23 years old, a native of Ningbo, and now lives at her mother's home in Panjia Lane. She has been married for five years. (Question) Have the husband and wife always been good? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Why do you want to get a divorce? (Answer) He (referring to the defendant) suffers from mental illness and epilepsy and often abuses me, etc. Next, the defendant Gu Youcai confessed that he was 27 years old, a native of Ningbo, and lived at No. 53 Tongqing Street, Fangbang Bridge. He used to work in a foreign company, but resigned last year due to illness. (Question) What illness do you have? (Answer) I occasionally get sick and lose consciousness, but it only lasts a few minutes and then I recover. However, this disease started three years after our marriage. She asked for a divorce and I could not agree to it. In addition, the various expenses for the wedding and other things cost about 2,000 yuan, etc. The questioner ordered the defendant to withdraw from the court and then said to the plaintiff, husband and wife should help each other, and women should also help bear the burden of life when men are sick and forced to do so. Your claim that the defendant abused you is not sufficiently proven. If you say that the defendant suffers from mental illness, then the defendant admits in court that it is a type of epilepsy. Now, if you are determined to divorce, you should only compensate a certain amount. The plaintiff replied that she works in a foreign company as a number taker and earns 20 yuan a month. After deducting 5 yuan for meals, she only earns 15 yuan a month, so she cannot afford to pay compensation. The questioner repeatedly persuaded the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to the case. As a result, the plaintiff paid the defendant 300 yuan, which was paid in two installments. The first installment was December 20 and the second installment was January 20 of the 20th year of the Republic. Both parties agreed and the settlement was reached. The plaintiff also said that she had a trunk and other things in the defendant's house and requested their return. The questioner asked the defendant and said that although there were five trunks, they were all empty and all the clothes had been taken away. The questioner ordered the defendant to return the five boxes to the plaintiff. The questioner wrote a settlement record and the two parties signed it and left the court.</p>
<h3>Rescue Association Breaks Up Abduction Case on Jinan Steamer</h3>
<p>Rescue Association investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang and others checked the abductors on the Taikoo Company's Jinan steamer to Amoy at 10 am yesterday. When they saw a middle-aged man carrying a child with suspicious behavior, they asked the man named Huang Ashun, a native of Huzhou, and the child was his own son. The investigators separately inquired and the child claimed to be Xie Fuqing, nine years old, also a native of Huzhou, and did not know Huang. The truth was revealed and the water police were arrested and taken to the police station along with a basket. According to Huang Ashun, he is 45 years old and still claims that the child is his son. However, the child said that my mother died when I was three years old and my father died when I was four years old. There is no one in my family. A family looked after me for a few years and I don’t know the surname. This person (referring to Huang Ashun) was seen at Hehe, Huzhou. There are five of them in total who brought me to Shanghai and gave me to this person to take me to the boat. I don’t know where I am going. The officer said that the case was clear and the basket was empty. He was immediately sent to the Local Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Eloping Siblings-in-Law Cause Quarrel</h3>
<p>Wang Rongfang, a native of Wuxi, resided at No. 5, Lane Xianghe, Wanyu Wharf, in the southern part of the city. His wife had passed away early, and due to the lack of a homemaker, he entrusted a matchmaker to arrange a second marriage with a fellow villager, a woman named Jiang. Jiang was currently fifty-six years old and had been married into the family for sixteen years. Later, she adopted a daughter named Meiying, who was nineteen years old and originally from Changzhou. The girl was beautiful, so Jiang loved her dearly. Wang's son from his previous marriage, Xuechu, was twenty-nine years old and also widowed. Wang passed away in August of this year. After Wang's death, Xuechu had a dispute with his stepmother, demanding that she find him another wife. Jiang refused, stating that there were no suitable candidates. As Xuechu was stubborn, the argument escalated. Jiang, out of desperation, arranged for her step-sister Meiying to marry him to save face economically and prevent criticism from the neighbors. She had the "siblings" live separately at No. 67, Lane Houde, Tangjiawan. Xuechu went to work at a nearby garment shop during the day and returned home in the evening. This arrangement had lasted for over two months, and the couple seemed quite affectionate. The neighbors, unaware of the truth, assumed they were a young married couple. Recently, Meiying suddenly fell ill with a severe foot ailment, making it difficult for her to walk. She hastily returned to her mother's house to recuperate a few days ago without informing Xuechu. When Xuechu returned home that evening and discovered what had happened, he was furious. The following afternoon, at around 2 p.m., he rushed back to his mother's house and berated Meiying severely. Jiang tried to mediate, but was met with anger. The argument started with verbal sparring and escalated into a violent conflict. Jiang, being old and weak, was no match for Xuechu and was injured, crying out for help in extreme pain. Peng Qisheng, the guard officer of the Eighth Gang, heard the commotion and rushed over to investigate. After learning the details, he brought everyone involved to the First Section of the First District Police Station for questioning and handling by the police chief.</p>

<p>A dispute between Annamese sailors and Chinese cooks. The French merchant ship, C.A.M.M.A.N.D.A.N.T.H.E.N.R.I.K.I.U.I.E.R.E, docked at the Dongxing Railway Wharf in Pudong the other day to unload goods. The ship carried a large quantity of salted fish, and the twenty-seven Annamese sailors on board secretly stole about 200 catties of salted fish and hid it under the iron plates in the hold, intending to sell it. This was discovered by the Chinese cooks and oilers on the ship, who, at about 10:00 p.m. the other night, acted as thieves stealing from thieves. They conspired to steal the salted fish that the Annamese sailors had stolen, but the Annamese sailors were on guard. Upon witnessing this, they angrily dragged the oilers Yao Anning (29 years old, from Ningbo), Wang Xintang (24 years old, from Ningbo), Wu Ayou (25 years old, from Ningbo), and the two compradors Wang Keqing's employees Xu Shuibin (25 years old, from Ningbo), Xiong Yunqing (20 years old, from Wuxi), totaling five people and</p>

<p>reported it to the ship's captain and first mate, who in turn accused the five Chinese of stealing goods from the ship, completely concealing the fact that the Annamese sailors had stolen the fish in the first place. The Chinese were about to protest when they were stopped. The captain ordered them to be detained and notified the French Concession Police by telephone. The French Concession Police stated that the case occurred on the water, so they sent a letter to the Water Police Station requesting permission. The Water Police Station Chief authorized Chinese detective Cheng Yongnian to accompany Western police officers and French Concession Police detectives by ship at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to take the Chinese, who had been detained overnight, to the French Concession Police Station to await trial in the French court.</p>

A railway police officer questioned him. The boy claimed his name was Chen Defu, 11 years old, from Zhili. He could not remember his parents' names or addresses. He said that he had been abducted by street performers since he was a child. They took a boat to Shanghai. After disembarking, the street performers disappeared. He had been wandering in Shanghai for several days with nowhere to go, so he came to the station to sit down and cry. The railway police officer took him to the Police Affairs Office of the South Station of the Railway for safekeeping. Police Officer Zhuang prepared a document and sent him to the Xin Puyu Hall for care.</p>

<h3>Market Value of Western Writers' Handwriting</h3>
<p>— Juan Xi</p>
<p>The words and actions of an artist or writer are often admired by their fans, and their handwriting is cherished by those who respect them. This is a natural feeling that people have for those who have special talents and skills. This is evidenced by the social psychology of both Western and Eastern societies. It goes without saying that this is even more so in the West, where literature and art are closer to the lives of the general public. Therefore, writers' handwriting can become a kind of market value in the market, just like a commodity transaction. Naturally, the price of this commodity varies depending on the degree of respect that society has for the writer. This trend once spread to Japan. The (Literary Club) (Magazine) once auctioned off the original manuscripts of various writers in Hogno in their hometown. News also carried the news of the sale of Natsume Sōseki's letters and Mrs. Yosano Akiko's short poems (manuscripts).</p>
<p>Let's talk about the market value of Western writers' handwriting.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the market value of writers' handwriting in the West has the nature of historical evidence. It is the highest market value among writers' handwriting. Beethoven's scores, religious reformer Martin Luther's petitions, and the drafts of Huguenot operas are all suitable for large-scale memorial halls to purchase because the prices are very expensive.</p>
<p>What most people find interesting are the fragments of writers that we have long been exposed to because these are within the ability of ordinary people to buy. For example, an eight-line letter from Ibsen, in which he wrote (Yesterday was the first performance of Hedda Gabler, and it received a great ovation. I was invited out five times), was priced at only 25 marks. A letter requesting to rent a house was bought for 76 marks. The most expensive was Tolstoy's proofreading manuscript of (The Kingdom of God Is Within You) (with traces of blue ink revisions), which sold for only 200 marks per four pages. Turgenev's German letter to the modern magazine rejecting manuscript restrictions sold for only 30 marks.</p>
<p>However, among these manuscripts that are easily purchased by the general public, there are also relatively high prices. For example, Hauptmann only wrote (Art is religion, January 1913) on a photograph, and this photograph sold for 36 marks. Also, on his own 1886 photograph, he wrote in pencil (The sword has an edge, the school teacher has white ink in this... there is Harschent (place name) Hauptmann). Just these few words sold for 126 marks. A letter he wrote to a friend in Berlin when he was 24 years old, mentioning his family and money, was sold for 50 marks. Six lines of text written on Mrs. Maria's business card sold for only four marks, which is the cheapest of all his handwriting.</p>
<p>On the French writer's side, a business card signed by Coquelin sold for five marks, but Maupassant's sold for 26 marks to 30 marks. The relatively precious Flaubert's letter only sold for 26 marks. Zola's letter sold for 30 marks. The highest market value was still Rousseau, whose letter to the mayor of Coully sold for 350 marks. Other letters even sold for 420 marks. Daudet's original translation of Tartarin was worth 10 marks per page. Verlaine's collection of poems sold for 120 marks. A three-line letter from El Harlan sold for 10 marks, while the notorious (George Sand), together with her photograph, could only sell for 26 marks. One cannot help but sigh at her ill fate. In addition, Zola's letters sold relatively high, with one page selling for 18 marks to 26 marks. Dumas's sold for only four marks or 10 marks. Maeterlinck's letters sold for only 10 marks per page.</p>
<p>The market value of British writers is relatively high. A two-page letter from Carlyle, with the envelope attached, can sell for 100 marks. Dickens's letter, with his signature, envelope, and wax seal carefully preserved, can sell for 50 marks or 80 marks. Ruskin's, however, sold relatively cheaply, with one letter worth only four marks or 12 marks. Browning's sold for 10 marks.</p>
<p>Letters from American poets sold for 60 marks per letter from Lowell and 26 marks from Markham.</p>
<p>Next, the relatively inexpensive writers' handwriting are the proofreading manuscripts of the German poet Demel, which sold for only 26 marks each. Letters sold for only three marks or eight marks. A letter from the author of (Youth), Hellbig, sold for only two marks.</p>
<p>As for the more expensive items with reference value, it is worth mentioning that Schiller's original manuscript, Fragment, sold for 160 marks. Fichtel's letter describing his own situation sold for 1,500 marks. Heine's section of (Lullaby) also sold for 1,500 marks. Schiller King's (Weavers' Song) sold for 2,000 marks. This is considered a high price in the handwriting market. Moreover, the draft of his will, less than five pages, sold for 1,250 marks. A four-line poem from (Autumn Posture) sold for 200 marks. A letter to a Paris magazine describing his poverty sold for 660 marks. He is truly considered a darling of the handwriting market. Goethe's letters also sold for 60 marks.</p>
<p>I have not yet seen writers' handwriting enter the market in our country and form its market value. Past reports have recorded that writers' calligraphy and paintings could be sent to pawnshops. I fear that this has only become a rhyme left in history.</p>

<h3>A Day in the Palace</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I picked up a pen to write in my diary. Now that I pick it up, I simply don’t know where to start. I’ll just write haphazardly.</p>
<p>Today, just as dawn was breaking and the sun had not yet risen, the tinkling sounds of a piano drifted from the reception room into my ears with the slightly chilly morning breeze. Qi, who shares the room, said angrily, "Damn it! Making such a racket so early! Just because you don't want to sleep, do you have to make everyone else stay awake with you? This isn't some imperial palace where you can play music! If you like playing the piano and love music, why didn't you go to the Central Conservatory of Music? Why do you have to come here to torment people?"</p>
<p>"This is really鬼罷," Jia also said.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is what I was thinking too.</p>
<p>The clear and heavy rising bell rang. The bell rang one chime at a time, and at the same time, the noise in our dormitory increased second by second. One voice after another, "Nanny!" "Nanny!" They were these disheveled and dirty-faced nannies running back and forth in the corridors and up and down the stairs.</p>
<p>I really don't understand what this means. Sister Zhen, known for her novel ideas and unconventionality, has become completely different since entering this so-called "palace." Before, when she was at a certain girls' middle school, she was the most fervent advocate of preserving natural beauty and opposed to applying rouge and powder and any artificial makeup. But now she can't hold on to her principles anymore. The assimilating power of the environment is truly great. She, like the average so-called "palace masters," spends almost all day applying rouge and powder, dousing herself in perfume, drawing her eyebrows, painting her lips, ironing her hair, and looking in the mirror (Oh, I really should be scolded by them as an outdated person who can't even remember the terms for these makeup items).</p>
<p>From 7:00 AM to 7:30 AM, which is supposed to be the time to prepare for class, they still leave their books on the bookshelf and fill the table with powder boxes, rouge boxes, perfume bottles, combs, mirrors... After finishing their makeup, they worry about what clothes to wear today.</p>
<p>"Yun, what clothes do you think I should wear today?" Sister Zhen asked me.</p>
<p>"Why ask me, a country girl who doesn't understand fashion? Go ask the fashion experts, Miss Jia and Madam Wan." I had wanted to vent my frustrations and grumble for a long time, but I had no opportunity. Now that I have said this, my whole body seems much lighter.</p>
<p>But she pouted and, without a word, picked a newly made long cheongsam from the bed piled with clothes and stormed out.</p>
<p>Less than a minute later, Jia's door rattled.</p>
<p>The bell rang to prepare for class. I didn't have class for the first hour today, so I leaned against the window watching them go to class.</p>
<p>Sister Zhen and Jia were together, talking and laughing as they headed to the Jian Gong Hall. To people who aren't used to seeing their attire, it really seems like they are going to the Dahua Hotel to participate in a fashion exhibition, not to go to class.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my father specifically wrote a registered letter telling Sister Zhen not to be too wasteful and to value money a little more, because the family's financial situation is very difficult now. But they are still like this, and it is useless to advise her, which only provokes her temper. ("My affairs don't need you to interfere...") Thinking about it really makes me angry.</p>
<p>Today, during Modern English class, I was extremely annoyed. Miss Qi, who prides herself on being an eloquent and sociable socialite, not only was her reading inaudible to Professor Kai, who was sitting in the lecture hall, but even I, who was sitting next to her, could barely hear her. I doubt she could even hear what she was reading herself. No wonder the school's bulletin board has to rack its brains to satirize and criticize. I used to scold the bulletin board for being boring, but now I think they should be critical. If you don't strive to improve yourself, of course you should be criticized.</p>
<p>I didn't have any classes in the afternoon, so after lunch, I rested for a while and then went to the library. I haven't finished organizing my political science notes, and I heard that there will be an exam tomorrow, which is really worrying.</p>
<p>I was hoping to work quietly in the library, but unexpectedly, the library was just as unsettling as the room. The reading room door would slam every minute. Annoying coughing, whispering, and the sound of moving tables and chairs, as well as the "tap-tap" of leather shoes coming in and out, really made me feel extremely uneasy. I couldn't get any work done. When I looked up, countless dreadful eyes were shooting over at me. I really didn't dare to linger in the library for even half a minute. So I hurriedly packed up my things and ran back to the dormitory.</p>
<p>Passing by the reception room, I thought that the reception room really needed to be renamed. The "guests" who "meet" are all "guests" who "meet" countless times every day. I really don't know what to call our reception room. Sometimes it becomes a small shop for eating snacks and coffee, sometimes it becomes a classroom for tutoring courses, sometimes it becomes a reading room for reading books and newspapers, and sometimes it even becomes a place for male and female students... By night, I am really afraid to pass by the front gate of Bin College and the reception room, because these two places often have things happening at night that I dare not look at or listen to.</p>
<p>Burning stoves and placing valuables in the dormitory, lighting candles and oil lamps after the electric lights are turned off, singing operas, playing musical instruments, playing phonographs, and other recreational activities that disrupt public peace during class and self-study time are explicitly prohibited in the educational guidelines. But there are too many of these kinds of things in this so-called "East Palace." I don't know if it's because the educational guidelines don't apply to our girls' dormitory or because our secluded female instructors are unwilling to cause trouble.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, Lian came back from class at Zi Bin College and invited me out to dinner. Lian, like me, would never trouble the poor nannies to run around unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>We ate at the Yi Society in front of the gate, but before we could finish a bowl of rice, Lian's fellow townsman, Mr. Li, came over and started talking to Lian endlessly, very intimately. This Mr. Li is probably the "nide Buy" they often talk about. They were talking so enthusiastically, but at this time, I didn't know what to do. I didn't eat much lunch today, so I felt very hungry at this time. But at this moment, I don't know why, I didn't dare to eat quickly to suppress my appetite, and a kind of heat suddenly arose on my face. I didn't dare to look at them directly, let alone talk to them. This kind of situation was more difficult than climbing a mountain of knives. Thinking about it, my heart felt like it was about to jump out of my body and run away, and my face was about to turn as red as if I had drunk three bottles of brandy. No wonder they want to ridicule me.</p>
<p>When I returned to the room, it was already dusk. A letter from Heng from my hometown was on the table. She said that she heard from others that my life is very good. Alas, does my kind of life deserve to be called "good"? It's really a disaster.</p>
<p>Night was gradually falling, and everything in front of the window was gradually blurring. At the same time, the clamor in the dormitory was gradually increasing. Phonographs, pianos, harmonicas, violins, sheng, xiao, flutes, pipes, Peking opera, Cantonese opera, solos, chorus... All kinds of sounds were sprouting like bamboo shoots after rain. Alas, it's terrible. My eardrums are almost being shattered by them. In addition, some of Sister Zhen's good friends also gathered in our room, talking endlessly. My head was made dizzy by them. It's not in my nature to sit in the room and talk with them. If I leave the room with my books and go to the library, the dreadful scenes in the library are enough to frighten me. And how can I forbid them from saying those unspeakable and sarcastic words? Alas, can this kind of life continue?</p>
<p>The lights flickered several times, and my eyes were also very strained. I have to take the political science exam tomorrow, so I have no choice but to stop writing. Yun wrote in the so-called East Palace.</p>
