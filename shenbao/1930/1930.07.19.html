<p>時評</p>
<h3>德政潮</h3>
<p>德國政潮。巳至最緊張之候。政府與國會不並存之勢。益形顯著。然此種形勢。非出偶然。蓋自白魯林組閣時即巳隠伏者也。前之穆勒内閣。爲多數黨内閣。而今之白魯林内閣。則以小團體爲基礎。可謂爲少數黨内閣。此少數黨内閣。將用何策以駕馭國會。白在當時。寗不籌慮及此。與新内閣反對之黨。若社會民主黨。最左翼之共産黨。與最右之國民社會主義黨。必將羣出全力以攻擊新政府。當亦爲白氏所洞悉。乃白氏絕不躊躇。僅憑藉中央黨淺薄之能力。而毅然組閣者何也。蓋白於組閣前一日。巳與興登堡總統商定。决以最後手段。實施此租稅法案。無論議會如何反對。皆所不顧。故白於四月一日舉行第一次閣議時。演說施政方針。謂本内閣之組織目的欲迅速解决國家之重要問題。不得巳時。當照法四十八條。下令實施。即最後令議會解體。亦　不恤。且　　國家重要問題之解决。原不可片刻延遲。故不得不要求迅速解决。可見其就任之初。即下極大决心。以此最後手段應付議會。蓋亦預知議會對於此案。必有極劇烈之反對。民主各黨。必有極大運動以倒政府。早存一不兩立之决心矣。故今日外電所述種種政潮現象。實亦早定於組閣之初。而無可避免者也。外電又謂目下政府與國會之命運。操之於舉足重輕之國權黨掌握。夫國權黨之足以舉足重輕。白亦預知。故於組閣之初。曾力圖拉攏該黨。興登堡亦曾召見其領袖胡根伯。勸其參加組閣。但均被拒絕。則該黨後此行動。亦可逆料。德政局之前途。誠大可令人玩味者矣。</p>

<h3>德國政潮勃發</h3>
<p>兩大政黨動議彈劾政府</p>
<p>内閣與國權黨談判决裂</p>
<h3>國會勢將立遭解散</h3>
<p>國民社十七日柏林電德國政潮勃發不止、且性質重大、即將來事過境遷、恐亦不易令人輕忘、且於德意志民族政治生活之進展上、亦將發生重大影響、蓋此次巳由黨見之爭、變爲賦稅權問題、政府即决定援用憲法四十八欵、不經國會通過徴抽新稅、抵補預算之不足、而國會内左右派兩大黨之態度、今亦愈趨顯明、社會民主黨昨日對共産黨不信任政府動議、雖未投票、但今亦提出要求二項、一爲彈劾政府、一即取消總統不經國會手續公佈白魯寗内閣財政案之非法命令、此外共産黨亦有類似動議、目下此三大動議、及内閣與本屆國會之運命、咸操於舉足輕重之國權黨掌握、今日下午該黨致函總理、要求立開談判、總理即應允延見該黨領袖胡根堡與奥白福倫兩氏、但對於該黨所提擁護内閣之條件、商榷甚久、卒告决裂、據稱、明日國會或將表决彈劾政府案、屆時該黨將羣投贊成票、如此政府與國會之敵對益顯、</p>
<p>又電　德報輿論對於政府援用憲法四十八欵施行國會未贊成之新稅事、亦頗不佳、如民主黨之伏錫志報稱、憲法上所許援用第四十八欵之時期、須至公共秩序與國會安全俱入於危險之中、今日尚非其時、徒以國家旣處於超出尋常之環境、而柄國者又皆庸庸之才、遂致有損及國家尊嚴之舉、良可惋歎、又同黨之柏林日報則不置可否、又同黨之柏林波森驛報、則目爲國會之悲劇、全由缺乏能人與處理不善之所致、中央敎黨之德意志報則稱、政府此舉、乃對於國家責任上所不得不然、按政府與黨各報中完全贊成此舉、僅此報而巳、蓋總理白魯寗即此黨之領袖也、右派較緩和之龍肅報稱、管理租稅、爲代議政治中國會基本權利之一、今德國會巳蒙一重大打擊、國權黨之柏林地方新聞、雖不滿政府此舉、但仍目之爲議會主義之壽終、保守黨之柏林波森日報、深以總統貿然簽字失於儉點爲憾、謂此事責任、當由内閣與國家黨共負之、皇黨之克魯法報則歡迎此舉、視爲總統之勝利、社會民主黨之進行報、則以總理未嘗力謀與該黨商榷同意、而遽出此極端手段爲憾、</p>
<h3>英國會之紛擾</h3>
<p>工黨左翼議員奪杖而逃</p>
<p>國會有史以來所未有</p>
<p>美聯社十七日倫敦電　下院於今日午後開會、工黨左翼議員痛詆政府對印度問題之宣言後、由首相麥唐納建議中止議員白羅克威之出席權、於是左翼議員大忿、羣起騷擾、議員皮開特竟攫國會權杖而逃、即經掌禮官與之互扭、奪回此歷史上之神聖物、後由全院以三二四票對四票、通過無期停止皮開特之出席權、今次紛擾、實爲英國會從來所未有、聞者爲之驚詫、各政黨亦皆怒斥皮氏之無禮、</p>

<h3>歐聯計劃英國覆文模稜</h3>
<p>深以减削國聯威權爲慮</p>
<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　英國現巳以同情論調、答覆法外長白里安關於歐洲政治上更密切聯盟之說帖、惟慮此種新制度或將削减國際聯盟會之效能與威權、而引成各大陸問仇視之越勢、英政府之意、以爲如將此種提議完全容納於國際聯盟會結構之中、則白里安之理想、可得有效力之保障、故英政府建議法國說帖可列入下屆聯盟議會之議程、覆文又謂英政府與海外自治地政府對此說帖、須加以愼重與良久之考慮云、</p>
<p>美聯十七日倫敦電　歐洲各國對白里安之歐洲聯邦計畫、皆巳致覆、最後覆者爲英政府、原擬僅致收到之照會、後忽變計、原文今晚在此間發表、前倫敦各報預料英政府之覆文、將不贊成、乃今並未表示此意、故衆頗以此爲異、該文初述英政府對白氏之計畫書巳審閱一過、惟覺事體重大必須與各領政府縝密研究、始能定奪、惟此項商榷、尚未告竣、而法政府所定七月十五日答覆之限期巳屆、故今次牒文所云、僅能目爲試騐性質、文中聲明英政府熱切贊助歐洲各國經濟合作主義、惟以爲此新組合、必須不超出國際聯盟構造範圍、而尤須體諒者、不列顚帝國實具包羅世界之性質云云、</p>

<h3>溽暑話首都張炎</h3>
<p>行人方便亭首都中山大路。爲進出城必經要道。車馬如雲。行人似織。滬上南京路。不是過也。現當局爲便利行人溲溺起見。特建小便亭四座。分段設立中山路旁。亭高約九尺。四角飛簷。髹以紅漆。外護木裙。作八角形。比亭矮約三尺。髹以深綠遥望之。紅綠相映。玲瓏别緻。行人便之。故人皆以方便亭名之也</p>
<p>冷飮室甚夥　京城炎熱。較往年尤烈。城南夫子廟三山府東街一帶。城中中山路及國府街城北一帶。應運而生之冷飮店。（出售冰淇淋冰汽水之類）巳開設不少。每行若干武。輒見白旗紅字軟招牌。隨風招展。有特闢精室。檯舖白布。瓶花揷養。座椅排列。佈置楚楚。又有因陋就簡。在店堂内放飯桌兩張。罩以白布。門前并列有冬青草花三四盆。以廣招徠。大做好交易。</p>
<p>莫愁湖熱鬧莫愁湖在首都水西門外。湖址佔地頗廣。風景幽蒨。爲長夏消暑第一勝地。刻下湖荷盛放。傾城士女。來此納凉賞荷者。絡繹不絕。花香鬢影。映照波心。至足樂也。而湖産之花香藕最著名。因藕質清脆而肥。肉細嫩。潔白如冰雪。味雖不及西湖藕甘。而汁充。香馥。確駕西湖之上也。</p>
<p>汽車開駛街車少停歇日久之公共汽車。巳於十一日正式開駛。計有客車二十餘輛。第一路。係由下關至黄埔路。計分十站。每詀銅元十二枚。每十分鐘開行一輛。其全線行車之時間。約四十分鐘可達。至苦力所拉之包車。因天氣過熱。血肉之軀。不能與烈日抗衡。故連日街車稀少。間有之。而索值亦因此抬高。乘車者反未遑論價。足見車少也。</p>

<h3>一得之言秋水</h3>
<p>青年們在這世上多活一天。就一天一天的在看輕社會。看輕朋友。甚而至於看輕了他自己。雖然一個男子。把他心上的鑰匙交給了一個女子。而和伊結了婚。可是他决不願他的心作此一度的開放而仍又關閉。</p>
<p>婦女們的心。可算是最柔和者了。可是當伊聽見了伊的舊戀和他人結婚而感到不能滿意的消息時。伊却不能自制伊内心些微的自滿和愉快。</p>
<p>有許多男子在某種妻子的目中。好像是一種舊式的首飾一樣。棄之可惜。留之無用。不知道伊將怎樣的擺佈他才好。或許伊偶而興起。把他戴了起來。可是這並不是爲了他價值之可貴。不過是一種感情的作用而已。</p>
<p>男子們發明了煤的替代品。食料的替代品。金剛鑽的替代品。甚而至於青春的替代品。可是他竟發明不出女人的替代品。開罐器的替代品和褲子的替代品。</p>
<p>自由之對於女子。比咖啡來得甜。可是和男子初吻的一刹那却比自由和咖啡更甜。</p>
<h3>杭游瑣紀（上）黄寄萍</h3>
<p>杭州青年會近組新聞學研究會。其宗旨在引起青年。研究報學之興趣。并予報界同人得一交換智識之機會。日前該會特邀報界先進戈公振氏前往演講。余亦偕行。先是往返函商。决定一日晚車出發。斯以五日即返。此行滿擬於游覽之餘。一覘杭城社會情形。惜以涯暑困人。爲時又促。故所得無幾。拉雜書此。聊備一格耳。</p>
<p>是晚快車誤時。六時二十分始離北站。余憑窗閒眺。滬北一帶。廠舍林立。殆爲滬本工業繁盛之區。回顧西望。則菜畦隴畝。竹籬茅舍。阡陌皆然。相隔一軌。而物質上之懸殊。幾疑别一天地。出龍華。金烏西沉。窗外景物。不復能辨矣。端坐車廂。戈氏乃述其前年環游世界之經歷。若城市之繁華。與鄕村之野景。頗饒佳趣。復出其所携各國新聞事業影片。一一爲余講解。知英美法德意日本各國之大報館及通訊社。觀其館舍之宏敞。組織之完備。工作之緊張。與夫業務之宏闊。誠使人五體投地。各報館能不計工本。利用科學。精益求精。欲新聞之正確也。聘專家任採訪。用電傳照相以證實。求送報之敏捷也。自備火車飛機輸船。三數小時送達全國。謀供給之便利也。自設工廠。製造機件·紙料·油墨。日報之外。復有晨刊·</p>
<p>午刊·夕刊·晚刊之發行。一日間之事件。盡載當日報章之上。乃悟近世報紙。已臻資本化·專門化·科學化·之極境凡爲吾人理相所不及者。彼則早已實現矣。他如操縱輿論之通信機關。如英之路透社。美之聯合社。德之大陸社。法之哈代社。日之聯合社。派員分駐各國要都。組織通信網。一事之起。必有報告。是非曲直。操其掌握。弱小國家。受害匪淺。吾國頻年外交之失敗。大都遭其反宣傳之影響。···余</p>
<p>聆其言。怦然有所感。與余同座之美人明思德夫婦。解華語。聞余等津津談論。頗示愉悅。與余通欵曲。彼謂旅杭垂二十載。杭城風土人情。甚爲熱悉。雜談中美兩國之國俗民情。相與歡笑。十一時抵杭。則報界同人及摯友等已鵠候久矣。</p>
<h3>紀秋丹閣荆夢蝶</h3>
<p>梅園之有秋丹閣。蓋緣起於丙寅之秋。而成於虞午之歲。名曰秋丹。紀實也。名之者主人。而實造物也。先是閣前故有牡丹一叢。是歲九秋。菊黄的屆而園中千百種菊。尚含苞不花。若有所待也。一日。主人方與余共話於館樓。園丁忽報道。牡丹開矣。噫。淵明三徑。竟學桃僵。姚魏兩家翻爲李代。洵異數也。主人聞之喜。即邀余偕往觀焉。旣至。見案上特供一盆。花色深紫。綠葉扶持。居然春色</p>
<h3>東遊心影（十二）錢華</h3>
<p>至設備方面每日新聞有美國製電光超高速印刷機一架。每小時可印十二萬份。又同高速度機一架。每小時可印七萬二千份機十二架。活字鑄造機十四架。鉛版鑄造機七架。照相銅版機六架。電傳照相機一架。此外尚有飛機七架。傳信鴿一百餘隻。社員共六八五名。工人一千四百四十二名。朝日新聞方面更爲優美完備。有超高速度朝日式輪機十七架每小時可印十三萬份。德國製四色印刷輪轉機一架。美國製輪轉機二架。平盤印刷機九架。電傳照相機一架。飛機十六架。社員及工人數與每日不相上下。傳信鴿二百五十隻。兩報之新聞均由社員本身供給。採用電通路透等通信社稿者絕少。國内各地均利用長途電話及飛機通信。遠地照片則利用電傳機。各地設通信局。派一社員主持之。國外亦然。凡全球各都大邑。莫不駐有專員。通信網之佈置。可稱嚴密兩報每年所獲之百數十萬利益金。除撥作公積金。股東社員紅利。及社員養老金等外。一部份用作發展社會公共事業。如去年大阪每日東亞調查會之設立。聘伯爵清浦硅官。伯爵内田康哉。男爵林權助等十人爲顧問。並主辦健康增進運動大會。設立義務診療所。及舉行第十一次全國中等學校足球比賽大會。第五次全國女子體育運動大會。第八次全國網球選手大比賽。及對於各種慈善事業之補助。據其宣稱近五年來對於此種附屬事業之消耗。己達二百萬金云。朝日新聞之附屬事業以發展航空及體育最爲努力。其航空運動兩部。人才濟濟。盛極一時。運動部主辦之朝日體育月刊尤爲人所稱道。銷路遍於全國。航空部有飛機十六架。大正十二年一月。由朝日主辦。開始東西定期航空。駛行東京大阪間。昭和三年八月十七日（即民國十七年）開始載運旅客及郵件。營業極發達。開日本航空事業之新紀元。去年四月一日始由日本航空輸送株式會社接辦。數年來朝日損失七十三萬二千三百九十一元。又日本訪歐長途大飛行朝日負擔四十萬八千九百七十二元。去年復舉辦國際水上競技大會。東西對抗田徑賽運動會。又去年爲朝日五十週年紀念。各種慶祝。盛極一時。並提出五十萬元補助社會各種事業。百萬元分配賞與全社職員。朝日新聞利用航空之威權。新聞方面因之特爲生色。迅速準確。爲他報所不及。如三年前張作霖皇姑屯被炸。朝日急派飛機五架前往採取新聞。翌晨照片新聞琳琅滿目。至今猶令人稱道不置。其他若大阪時事新報等數家。年亦稍有盈餘。但總不敵朝日與每日耳。</p>
<p>也。深秋何得有此。豈東皇雅愛名園。故作不速客之來耶。是誠足破洛陽花譜之紀錄矣。時觀者旣衆。咸謂牡丹屬富貴花。爭以晚達賀主人。余則謂富貴之於主人。事非甚重。惟以殘秋蕭瑟之候。而重覩春榮。如人之老而不老。此實壽者之徴。足爲主人頌耳。主人以爲然。遂命攝影以誌盛。余爲題一詩云。不是河陽與洛陽。黄華時節見花王。偏將國色酣秋色。誰道天香占晚香。老景敎人誇富貴。嬌容也自耐風霜。長春預兆東君福。一樹奇葩報吉祥。</p>
<p>閣在誦豳堂之西偏。故無名也。主人近日語余。將手書秋丹閣三字以顔之。孫頌沱先生並爲製一楹聯云。九月釀小春。名花秋放。萬頃收一閣。勝景天然。余亦用鳳頂格嵌秋丹兩字成一聯云。秋令見春華。九月風光駐青帝。丹忱維國計。五湖名蹟繼朱公。蓋斯閣下臨五湖。與鼋渚之陶朱閣遥遥相望。而主人平生。營實業外。兼重敎育。恒以生聚敎訓爲言。夙慕范少伯之爲人也。</p>
<p>短訊長沙全倦知老人書法。久爲海内崇仰。近因蔚然書畫社之請。定有潤例。以應愛老人墨寳者之渴望。通信索潤可向愛文義路赫德路口一三二四號。</p>

<h3>心上温馨（三三六）包天笑</h3>
<p>第十二回别宴離筵拈花留倩影名園嘉會鬭茗覩芳姿</p>
<p>左詩晨道。。我肚子餓了。。找一個地方去吃夜飯去。。吃了夜飯。我們再到各處去吧。。龍紫耘道。這裏還有日本料理咧。。聽說是三井洋行裏的大班娘娘在那裏主持。。日本人關於那種義務性質的園游會。。貴婦淑女參加的很多。。我們也去看看。。左詩晨道。。日本話不會說。。沒有意思。。龍紫耘道。。幾句普通話。。我還可以勉强。。好在日本和我們是同文之國。。言語說不通的地方。。還可以用文字來傳達。。只要鉛筆和紙片。。寫給他們看就得了。。而且我們也久不吃日本菜了。。今天何妨試試呢。。左詩晨也同意。兩人走進了那個日本料理店。。果然有幾個打扮得花枝招展的日本美人。。前來招待。。他們對客很爲恭敬。。好在他們不認得是何許人。。菜單是印好了的。華文和日文合璧的。。便是沒有華文。。這些和文也還可以識得。。他們又要了一瓶太陽啤酒。。只見一個妙齡女郎。。將一隻紫漆的盤兒。。託着一瓶酒和兩隻玻璃盃子。。安放在桌子上。深深地便鞠了一個躬。。龍左兩人。。看伊是個女學生。。不是下女模樣。不知是誰家令孃。也只好還了伊一禮。。可是以後却有些兒受累了。。每逢伊送上了一種菜來。。總是鞠一個躬。。他們至少也要還一個禮。吃完了這一頓日本料理。。也不知道鞠　了多少躬。。還了多少禮。。左詩晨笑向龍紫耘道。好了。這一個多禮的宴會。無論怎樣的盛會。。也沒有吃一樣菜。。要行一次禮的。。這日本料理吃了也太不上算。。龍紫耘道。。不是的。。你要知道他們本來席地而坐慣了的。。又他們以爲是個嫻習禮儀的。。在席地而坐的時候。。大家都是跪着的。。便是向你拜一拜。。也只要兩手據地。。頭向前衝就得了。。而且女子服從男子。譬如他們在家裏請客。他的夫人進上酒食時。。每一次竟也叩上一個頭。在做女人的以爲當然之事。。做丈夫的簡直是理也不理伊。。現在此地不是席地而坐。。所以他們故叩頭爲鞠躬。。其實是他們習以爲常。。不如此就不能算是嫻禮節了。。吃完日本料理以後。。由龍紫耘付子賬。。便走了出來。。那時巳在八點多鐘。。游人漸漸多起來了。那邊有個品茗處。。本來是一個菜地　現在傍着東首一角。。有一帶竹林。。設了幾十個座頭。。聽說是味　園主人自己設備的</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市不振</h3>
<p>内地來源見接</p>
<p>閘北　昨日黄渡來船十餘號、内中均係粳米、刻下河存漸有三十餘號、而價格因洋米狂跌、裏路産價下源、故大盤開進二十一元限盤、是以米行公會、要求當局取消評價登記等事、恢復向章、由米行公會直接賣買、俾免損耗、因此全日未有若何交易、按社會局組織評價會限制米價時、曾聲明在限盤以内、即行撤銷、刻下公會根據斯情、請求回復原狀本屬正當、但米店方面、邇來零售仍有賣二十三四元者、緣門市升斗零賣、斷難調查、因此外間時有暗盤私貼等情、故欲嚴平米價、首先檢察米店零售、緣居民升斗之進旣無發票、又難問價、務望當局三注意焉、羊秈貨稀市靜、通變依然平定、交易寥落、大盤續在十九元左右、總之刻下産銷兩市一致見軟、存粳行將大跌未奇也、</p>
<p>滬南　河下到米船三數號、本街揀巧而進、市况不振、蘇同粳祗開二十元關左、市交極微、緣邇來鄕莊零拆、受洋米狂小之影響、一致乏胃、故近日南北兩方雖無旺到、人心並勿恐慌也、羊秈微有做開、行情平疲、白元市銷凋零價格普通貨祗在十八元半左右、</p>
<h3>洋米跌後轉漲</h3>
<p>上午跌半元···下午漲三角</p>
<p>昨日洋米上午消化甚呆、人心更爲看小、浮多爭售、進戸寥寥市價突小有半元之鉅、大小絞因存到較多、更比他米爲軟、但至午後、平糶辦胃旣活本客帮亦以價跌合划、競起購買、市面立見轉機、行情亦回好三角、統市售開小絞五千包價十五元半至一角、大絞三千包、價十四元一角至十三元二角半、二號西貢一千三百包、價十五元四角半至三角、又一號五百包、價十七元、高十七元八角、小絞糙二千包、價十三元半至二角、齊耶地糙三百包、價十四元二角云、</p>
<h3>粉市轉入稳途</h3>
<p>昨日粉市忽呈盤旋之態、以洋麥報價祇小一二角、投機者人心無甚根據、至近期以實銷觀望、祗有零星交易、故市氣不佳遠期因前幾日跌度較甚、做心思者又見集中且近遠期之差别無幾大戸又發生套利生意、致遠期人心反稍微昻、觀後步局面、因廠家籌碼、目下巳少放出、此後此種行情當可暫時立住也、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、八九月份小五厘、十十一月份好二厘半、十二月份未動云</p>
<h3>遠期麥大戸吸收略昻</h3>
<p>現貨新陳各擋减小四五分</p>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後大致巳轉盤旋本月份因中小廠家均欲趁勢收買人心頗佳八月份初尚平稳、旋以内地帮仍陸續回出、致市勢又告平疲、至遠期以浮空抵補、某大戸多頭又收進頗巨、致市氣反見昻勢、據業中人之推測廠家在實銷未暢之際、當然須繼續靌壓、如銷路一活、自須零換一種景象也結果本月份較前日好二分八月份小二分、九月份不動、十月份好一分、十一月份好二分、十二月好一分現麥統市成交仍不甚暢、因市上高貨甚少、中次居多、致廠家均無進意客戸雖欲脫手、亦屬無法可想、由此新陳各檔喊價又小四五分、開山東陳麥徐州瑶、</p>
<p>灣麥共開二千八百餘包、由阜豐收去云、</p>
<p>南北貨　新金菜隨到隨罄</p>
<p>行盤二十六兩</p>
<p>首批新金針菜前日已由鎭江運到、計衆興菜一百十二包、均係各行自行辦來、貨品尚佳、行盤定二十六兩、各帮聞訊咸有採購試新、以厦門福州等帮交易較多、當即售完、聞第二批係新大興菜日内亦可踵到云、</p>
<p>絲茶　雙宫繭輸出較暢</p>
<p>上月份共輸出四百十八包</p>
<p>近年來雙宫繭法日銷胃尚健、海外絲織廠繅成絲經用以織造領結之類、上月份適值新陳雙宫繭代謝時期、雙宫繭輪出較暢、六月份共計輸出四百十八包、較五月份計增一百二十一包云、</p>
<h3>祁寗花香交易暢旺</h3>
<p>英俄兩莊大競銷</p>
<p>昨日祁寗兩路之花香紅茶、俄國恊助會業己大舉開辦英莊行家亦紛紛搜買、交易甚暢、惟俄莊認盤極緊、華茶商仍多虧折、至綠茶市面、大勢尚難認爲佳象、高莊珍遐、雖有少數去胃、但售盤己較前見跌四五兩、針眉秀眉等項市况亦較上星期寥落、惟高莊貢熙、市勢仍趨堅挺云　　五金　會司鐵登峯造極</p>
<p>會司鐵昨日估價每箱竟又開至二十五兩、誠爲會司鐵來申後最高之紀錄、但各帮之採辦者、並不因此而裹足、昨日開價益有登峯造極之象、如老鋼廠貨開二十六兩、新鋼廠貨二十五兩、野鷄貨二十三兩五錢、聞連日開出有六七百箱、係本街廠家購去爲最多云、</p>

<h3>黑人的詩歌楊昌溪</h3>
<p>美國的黑奴制度經過了長期的歷史、他們在奴隸的生活中轉側、他們爲着主人的深威而勞苦的日夜工作、他們感覺到白人是上帝特别生出來壓迫他們的、他們認定自己的苦痛是命運的驅使、所以在他們長長的歷史中沒有反抗和控訴、但是、自從林肯在形式上的解放黑奴以後、五六十年中、黑人漸漸的在經濟上、在社會上、在職業上、有了地位、除了生活安定、和已入了美國籍的黑人外、大多數的黑人仍然在變相的奴隸生活、只不過虐待的事是比較的少罷了、</p>
<p>因此、在解放後的黑人得着了敎育的機會、在智識份中所感到的民族間的種種不平、都在文學中反映着、</p>
<p>我們在美國黑人詩歌的全部檢閱中、可以發見下列幾種思想、</p>
<p>（一）是把他們在現實所受的苦痛忘掉、認爲他們在世上永得不着安慰和幸福、因把皈依上帝作爲他們唯一的安慰、對於現實的痛苦並不想法解除、只想早日的死掉、只想「要去到天堂、坐在天使的座上、吃那天使的珍賞···得了安適舒暢、我同我的上帝、可以隨心所欲」、只想「甜蜜而可愛的車子摇摇的低下、牠是來接我回家、···憑我的能力我詳查了迦南（GORDAND）、在我的後面有一隊天使、他們是來接我回家」在這種詩歌中、前者是黑人在奴隸生活渴想自由的悲吟、完全是想躱避世界上的壓迫和苦痛、後者是在讚美詩夢想着迦南、把他們自己比作古埃及受難的以色列難民、夢想着上帝已爲他們黑奴揀選了肥沃的迦南作爲選民的居留地、但是地上的痛苦並不因爲上帝的歌誦而减輕、只有白人所利用的宗敎麻醉劑庇泡浸中、减淡他們對於白人的仇視、銷禍他們民族的意識、非惟夢想的迦南不能成爲選民們的王國、</p>
<p>即是他們的祖國亞非利加巳經沒有一席地是他們的了、</p>
<p>（二）是知足的態度、他們在贊美亞非利加熱道下的林莽、回想幼年時他在故鄕的情况、在歌咏黑姑娘們的美、在吟咏美國的物質文明、在歌誦大自然的景色、這因爲他們巳由奴隸而得到了受高等敎育的機會、而且藉着社會上比較好的地位、可以安然的吟咏一切、並不以文學當作喚醒民族覺悟底信號、更是因爲他們其中的人或許已入了美國國籍、而且歌咏着、「我是較黑的弟兄、當朋友來待他們叫我到廚房去吃、但是我笑、好好的吃、長成了强壯、···明天當朋友來待我可以坐在桌上、沒有人敢對我說、到廚房去吃···他們可以看到我是怎般的美麗、他們是如何的羞慚···呀、我也是美利堅人」、把他們的全身心投向白人的王國裏、</p>
<p>（三）是忠寳奴隸的表現、因爲他們在許多年代的泡浸和陶鎔中、巳經失掉了民族的認識、並不曾了解白　　黑人的區别是怎樣、並不曾了解他們的主活是否奴隸、而很忠實於他們的工作、所以在黑人全部詩歌中、爲工人們所最愛歌唱的描寫約翰亨利（JOHN　HENRY）的十多首詩中、很深刻的描寫黑人因爲百餘年的陶鎔、簡直成了一個忠實的奴隸、雖然有的詩歌認爲約翰亨利是一個鐵路工人、有的認爲他們是一個忠實的鋼鐵工人、但是約翰亨利忠於他的職業、决定日夜不絕的工作、决定握着鐵鎚死去底描寫是共通的、所以在一首最爲工人們喜誦的詩中、亨利向只說、一人終是一個人、我要始終的隨着衆人工作、我决握着鐵鎚死掉、」甚至於他對他的監工者說、「人終於是一個人、我要晝夜的工作、决定握着鐵鎚而死掉、」但是以後他上山去把蒸汽的鑿孔器打下時因爲石頭太高、他的力量太少、終於在安下鐵鎚時而死掉了、在另一首中、描寫亨利死前對他兒子說的最後一句話、是望他不要去幹其他的勾當、還是做他父親曾經犧牲的打鋼鐵工人、在這種詩歌中很十足的代表着黑人一部的忠實奴隸性、而且希望他的兒子繼承他的事業、這種約翰亨利型的工人、是白人所歌頌所期望的、</p>
<p>但是、這三種的表現、漸漸的爲時代潮流所克服、爲了世界上被壓迫的弱小民族都要挣脫了樊籠、跑到自由和獨立的境地裏、所以、近時黑人的文學中、尤其是詩歌中、所呈現的民族的覺醒是更尖銳化、</p>
<p>在主人和奴隸的生活大大的懸殊中已經感覺到「太太住在高樓大厦中、保姆住在後庭内、太太握着白手玩、保姆拚命的工作不絕、·····主人們始終是騎馬、黑奴們繞着他而工作不絕、主人們在白天睡覺、黑奴們在地底下挖掘」的苦樂太懸遠了、而且整天在烈日下把鋤頭拿着强烈的爲主人揀海鳥糞作爲肥料的黑奴、描寫出「白人穿着漿熨好了的襯衫坐在蔭處、上帝曾經生下了最懶的人、」而對於上帝的皈依巳經失了信仰、淪於奴隸地位的黑人巳經到民族自覺的地位了、所以、他們唱着、「喂、我是黑、但我也是黑得愛人、我如夜之子般的黝黑、如深黯的洞窟般的幽黑、我是屬於一個奴隸種族底嫩枝、他協力建立一個强壯的國家、那你我可以在世界上得着平等的待遇、勇敢和强毅如那在惡浪潮流上的人們、高高的撑起一隻旗幟、她的飄揚打倒一切的敵對、」是很深切的表明需要建設一個獨立的國家是黑人當今所感覺到的大問題、所以、美國批評家加爾佛吞（V·F·CALVERTON）在他的「美國黑人文學選集」底引言中、認爲「黑人文學出發的觀點是民族的、而是爲民族的自覺而創作、爲民族的痛苦而歌吟、並不是爲藝術而藝術、而且黑人文學之興起、在將來會因着文學之成長而達到全民族的興起、」是更可以證實黑人對於將來的出路問題、是必需要着重於民族的自由和解放、所以、我先談到最能十足的表現黑人底自覺的詩歌、關於小說中的民族意識的表現讓我以後再作一次檢討、</p>

<h3>世界文學的故事（一八○）美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第四十七章　亞美利加的小說</p>
<p>在紐罕布什爾的一山的側面、高高地有一簇岩石是形成巨大的人的半面像的、這是世界上自然底奇觀之一、又是旅行者誰都知道的景物、霍桑使「山的老人」特别地成了有特色的自己的東西、他想像這有怎樣的影響及於長育在牠的影下的敏感的兒童、因此、他在「大石臉」之中、是將牠看想爲一個象徴、一個靈感的、他使那岩石變化爲詩底說敎了、在霍桑執筆之前、紐英格蘭不會以「神仙的境地」聞名、但他執筆以後、羅曼斯將那地採用爲牠的永遠的住所之一了、</p>
<p>庫拍和歐文和霍桑在生前見到了自己的作品風行、而且享受了儘作者所要求的限度的實際底繁榮、他們從不缺乏衣服、膳食或舒適的牀、較他們早死的年青的同代人以特加亞侖坡、則在那短短的一生之間和貧困挣扎、世界是直至他的死後、纔認識他爲亞美利加最大的文學者的、沒有别的亞美利加人在歐羅巴文學之上有着那麽强大的影響了、一九○九年在坡的誕生百年紀念、從紐約以至莫斯科、凡有權能的作家當承認自己或自己的國有負於坡的天才這事的、</p>
<p>坡是在羅曼斯作家以上、他是新頴的、獨創底的短篇小說的創造者、同時也是詩人、是批評家、然而倘若除了說他的生涯的故事本身就是羅曼斯、而坡是一種眞實的小說底人物、是小說及戲曲的主材以外、並無别的理由、那麽將他作爲羅曼斯作家來看待也是公平的事、那故事的主題是訴於丨丨不論是否特殊地亞美利加底的、丨我們的感情、訴於我們對於向困難的境遇進行的人們的那稱讚的感情的、我們在實業界、在政治界、喜歡自成ＳＥＬＦＭＡＤＥ的人、自然什麽人都不是自成、但若將這一詞照普通的意義來解釋、我們可以稱坡爲自成的作家的、不消說、他帶了才能出世、但他爲要維持那才能的純粹、在失望和困難之中發揮牠、也苦鬭過的、</p>
<p>坡當二十四歲時、由稱作「瓶中的方特夫人」的短篇小說、獲得巴爾的摩爾州一家報紙所發給的一百金元的賞金、這小說有兩點是可注目的、這立時顯示了坡的對於文體和手法的驅使的力、而且、恐怕這是他得了十分報酬的唯一的小說罷、爲什麽呢、因爲坡是並非由他那最美的小說而且當然也並非由他的詩却由辛勞的雜誌業和刻板的編輯事務、以度他的貧苦生活的、他是小心謹愼的職工、而且他不能夠單是爲了急於候用的錢做性急的工作、文學的歷史記錄着關於貧困和艱難和物質底福祉對於藝術理想的犧牲的許多事件、然而文學底職業的光榮的實例、在坡的例子以上的、再也沒有了、他是傲然確信自己的能力、有知道自己的最優的作品蓋有不朽的印記這一種幸福的誇傲的人物、悲嘆於他的貧困、或以他所住的世界、忽視天才人而發牢騷者是不合於坡的精神的事罷、然而有一個小小的場景或者事實、是劇化他的生涯的、他曾經做過合衆國陸軍士官學校的候補生數月、十六年之後、他的妻臨終時、蓋於她的牀上的唯一的東西就是他的軍服、</p>
<p>坡的小說叙述着神秘的境地和那境地及於人心上的影響、他那吸收底興味、是在現今成着叫作心理底習慣的東西之中、他遠在歇洛克福爾麽斯和亞森羅賓出世之前就創造了偵探小說、在他看來、偵探小說全然不是犯人是否被捕被罰的問題、這全是心意的論理底部分、當事實之前怎樣作用這一個問題、他不但發明了偵探小說、那最優者「被竊的信」及「摩爾格街的命案」而且取了當他下筆時、案情還未大白的實際的事件做出「瑪麗羅蓋」這篇小說來、那結構幾乎和眞實的事件毫不差異、後來是判明了的、坡以他所謂自己的推理力極爲可誇、相信而且證明一個人所能籌思的、機械底或智底什麽謎、别人總能夠分解出來的、</p>
<p>具有將那對於純粹理必珠能力、使其發達到那麽高的才能的坡似的詩人及夢想家、我們在文學者中是不多見的、這不是說理性和詩之間有不能相容的東西在、倒全是和這相反、我們知道但丁和莎士比亞和哥德于凡有思想的部門内都是有能力的、然而一切種類的能力都被給僣一個人的頭腦、這種事却稀罕、跟着時進行、我們對於那在還未到達他的力的絕頂前、他那光輝的盛時就中斷了的坡之是稀見的最高的才能、就愈益確然地理解了、</p>
<p>坡的施了巧妙的推理的神秘底故事、恐憤　是聰明的詭計而巳、雖然在同世紀四分之三之間、沒有别的作家是聰明得足以超越他的、他的最美的散文並不見於他那創意底故事之中、却見於詩或音樂似的、有直接的影響於情緒及感覺之上的作品之中、「李奇亞」及「影」似的作品是完全的、如果坡不是那一類的散文詩的創案者丨丨凡有獨創底創造追跡於那以前的什麽東西是可以的丨丨那麽他還是那蠱惑底麽術並無比敵者的巨匠自身是麽術家的詩人斯文本稱坡爲「常常」徹底地磨出自己的思想、從中造出或一堅實、圓熟、而且不朽的東西的」「完全的天才詩人、」坡在兩種意義上是完全的、他將他的思想、都帶到那最後的形、而完成了牠、而且他有着偉大的多角底才能、他的短篇小說是足以給他名聲的東西、然而即使沒有那個、他也該作爲批評家及詩人而被記憶的罷、</p>
<p>坡的有些批評、因爲惹起他的批評的書沒有什麽價值、倘無他的批評就會被忘却了的緣故、已經有些失掉原有的興味了、然而即在新聞上的一時的批評、他也常將有恒久底價值的或種思想表現於文學中、就全體看來、他的文學上的論文有着比起當時任何别的亞美利加人來、更多的光和學問、於一般底讀者和專門底研究者、這些是成着在一八五○年以前亞美　加文學的最優的叙述的、他爲了自己及别人、在極不順利的環境當中、維持了精美的作品的旗幟的事、爲了他的不朽的名譽、將牠記憶着罷、他幾乎獨自揭了他的旗幟進行、而具有勇氣和力和正當的一種謙讓以追隨他的同代人是極稀罕的、那將坡住於亞美利加、在亞美利加寫作的事使成爲於歐羅巴的抵評家永遠難解的不可思議的問題者、就是並不比他的故事的迷離或他的詩的美差些、他的批評的優越、他是偉大的智能能夠生於任何環境中這一種不可思議的眞理的一例、這樣的事怎樣、或者爲什麽發生的、誰也不能說明、這是坡本人不能推理到滿足的結論的生的羅曼底神秘之一、</p>
<p>在同世紀前半的作家之中、有當時頗爲重要現今還可記憶的人、即斯陀夫人、「托穆伯父的小屋」將她寫着牠時所有的什麽夢或企望以外的印象給人、林肯以多於歷名底精確的勇氣嘗稱她爲一惹起這大戰的小夫人、」在小說中時時求着道德問題的托爾斯泰將牠加入於他所稱爲眞的藝術的書的極有限的表中、在我看來、這似乎是屬於第二流的藝術、爲什麽呢、因爲這是特殊的辯難、宣傳、不是將那作品提高到剌戟了牠的火急的問題以上那樣澄靜的東西、然而除了或種舊式的道德論以外、這並不寫得拙劣、故事生動、純正的熱情則在鮮明的感傷性之上奏着凱歌、</p>
<p>在南北戰爭以後、漸至成熟的時代、有占着第一重要的地位的三個作家、和有較遜的眞價值的作家數人、那三人便是馬可脫温、豪厄爾兹·和亨利詹姆士、</p>

<h3>Difficulties with Expenses for the Enlarged Conference</h3>
<p>Tan Zhen and Ji Gongquan Go to Taiyuan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Gongbo told people yesterday that the expenses for the Enlarged Conference are still being raised, and rumors of ample funds are not true. Because the Taiyuan side is frugal in everything, the allocation for the Enlarged Conference is not much. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the declaration was issued by the members of the Enlarged Committee, students and old friends have been asking for loans and seeking jobs, leaving them no time to rest. But in reality, the committee members are extremely poor. The Taiyuan side only issued 5,000 yuan last time, which was used up long ago. Now Zou, Xie, Tan, and others are rumored to have received huge sums of money, which is actually a false accusation. Tan Zhen, accompanied by Ji Gongquan, will go to Taiyuan to meet with Yan tonight at 9:30. They plan to stay in Taiyuan for three days before going to Zhengzhou to meet with Feng. Tan is accompanied by more than ten staff members, including Liu, and ten Chinese and foreign reporters from Beiping and Tianjin are going with them. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Hexiang met with Chinese and foreign reporters at 10:00 this morning and said that the Enlarged Conference has been completed and the government can be established soon. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The cadres of the Reorganization Faction in Beiping have been visiting Chen Gongbo in recent days, asking for living expenses. Because Chen Gongbo has held positions in the Guangdong-Han finance departments, he must have some hidden wealth. As a result, Chen Gongbo agreed to provide private assistance, giving each person several tens of yuan to temporarily maintain the status quo. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The provincial government committees have decided to hold a banquet for the Enlarged Committee and representatives in the conference room on the afternoon of the 21st. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Increase in International Postage</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications explained the reasons for the recent increase in international postage, stating that international postage rates are based on the gold franc of 100 centimes, and the postage for each letter weighing 20 grams is 25 centimes. All countries collect fees by converting according to the approximate value of their national currency. Our country has always collected one silver dollar, but due to the successive rise in gold prices, the losses have been too great. Therefore, the conversion rate has been changed from one jiao to one jiao and five fen to be equal to the current price of 25 centimes in gold currency. This is the result of changes in the gold and silver exchange rate and does not increase postage, nor will it affect the burden of overseas Chinese. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<h3>Capital Garrison Executes Criminals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Garrison executed Dong Ziyou, a former pseudo-marshal, and two bandits, Ma Hanyuan and Chen Songtian, by firing squad on the afternoon of the 18th. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The German Political Tide</h3>
<p>The political tide in Germany has reached its most tense moment. The incompatibility of the government and the parliament is becoming increasingly apparent. However, this situation is not accidental. It has been latent since the formation of the Bruening cabinet. The previous Mueller cabinet was a majority party cabinet, while the current Bruening cabinet is based on small groups and can be said to be a minority party cabinet. What strategy will this minority party cabinet use to control the parliament? Didn't Bruening consider this at the time? The parties opposed to the new cabinet, such as the Social Democrats, the far-left Communists, and the far-right National Socialists, will surely use all their strength to attack the new government. Bruening must have been aware of this. Yet Bruening did not hesitate at all, relying only on the shallow strength of the Center Party and resolutely forming the cabinet. Why? Because Bruening had agreed with President Hindenburg the day before the cabinet was formed to implement the tax bill with the final means, regardless of how the parliament opposed it. Therefore, when Bruening held the first cabinet meeting on April 1, he delivered a policy speech, saying that the purpose of organizing this cabinet was to quickly resolve the important issues of the country. If necessary, he would issue orders for implementation according to Article 48 of the law. Even if it meant dissolving the parliament as a last resort, he would not hesitate. Moreover, the resolution of important national issues cannot be delayed for a moment, so he had to demand a quick solution. It can be seen that from the beginning of his tenure, he made a great determination to deal with the parliament with this final means. He also anticipated that the parliament would have extremely strong opposition to this bill, and the democratic parties would launch a major movement to overthrow the government. He had long held a resolve of mutual exclusivity. Therefore, the various political phenomena described in today's foreign telegrams were actually predetermined at the beginning of the cabinet formation and were unavoidable. The foreign telegrams also said that the fate of the current government and parliament is in the hands of the pivotal German National People's Party. Bruening also anticipated that the German National People's Party would be pivotal. Therefore, at the beginning of the cabinet formation, he tried to win over the party. Hindenburg also summoned its leader, Hugenberg, to persuade him to join the cabinet, but both were rejected. Therefore, the party's subsequent actions can also be predicted. The future of the German political situation is indeed worthy of our consideration.</p>

However, provinces and cities such as Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Kangding, Qinghai, Henan, Jiangsu, Suiyuan, Chahar, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Beiping, and Tianjin are either too far from Nanjing, or the party headquarters cannot be made public, or the party headquarters have not yet been established, making it difficult to handle the matter as scheduled. A flexible solution has been proposed, whereby the Beijing Municipal Party Headquarters will select and recommend party members who are qualified and registered in the aforementioned provinces and cities and their nearby areas.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Military Administration presented to the Executive Yuan, stating that most of the troops have gone to the front for combat, resulting in the first-level budget not yet being compiled, and the second-level budget cannot be compiled either. If the regulations in Article 31 of the charter, which state that funds cannot be disbursed if the budget has not been compiled and sent, are enforced, it will cause many obstacles. In order to prevent this, it is proposed to adopt a flexible solution, and before the budget for this year is completed, all expenses for the ministry and military expenses should continue to be paid temporarily according to the monthly payment budget in order to facilitate the organization of the military. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Audit Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to handle the matter accordingly. (Dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<h3>Political Crisis Erupts in Germany</h3>
<p>Two Major Parties Propose Impeachment of the Government</p>
<p>Negotiations Break Down Between the Cabinet and the German National People's Party</p>
<h3>The National Assembly Is Likely to Be Dissolved Soon</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th Dispatch from the National News Agency - The German political turmoil continues to erupt and is of great significance. Even if the matter passes, it will be difficult for people to forget easily and will also have a significant impact on the progress of the German nation's political life. This is because the dispute has changed from a struggle of party opinions to a question of taxation power. The government has decided to invoke Article 48 of the Constitution, levying new taxes without the approval of the National Assembly to offset the budget deficit. The attitudes of the two major parties, left and right, in the National Assembly are becoming increasingly clear. Yesterday, the Social Democratic Party did not vote on the Communist Party's motion of no confidence in the government, but today it has proposed two demands: one is to impeach the government, and the other is to revoke the President's illegal order to promulgate the Brüning cabinet's financial plan without going through the National Assembly. In addition, the Communist Party also has a similar motion. Currently, the fate of these three major motions, as well as the cabinet and the current National Assembly, rests in the hands of the pivotal National People's Party. This afternoon, the party sent a letter to the Prime Minister, requesting an immediate negotiation. The Prime Minister immediately agreed to meet with the party leaders, Hugenberg and Aubefohren, but after lengthy discussions on the conditions proposed by the party for supporting the cabinet, they ultimately broke down. It is said that the National Assembly may vote on the impeachment of the government tomorrow, at which time the party will collectively vote in favor. In this way, the antagonism between the government and the National Assembly is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>Another dispatch - German newspaper commentary on the government's use of Article 48 of the Constitution to implement new taxes not approved by the National Assembly is also quite unfavorable. For example, the Democratic Party's Vossische Zeitung stated that the period allowed by the Constitution for invoking Article 48 must be when public order and the security of the National Assembly are both in danger, and that today is not such a time. It is regrettable that the country is in an extraordinary environment, and those in power are mediocre, resulting in actions that damage the country's dignity. The Democratic Party's Berliner Tageblatt did not express a clear opinion. The Democratic Party's Berliner Börsen-Courier described it as a tragedy for the National Assembly, entirely due to a lack of capable people and poor handling. The Catholic Centre Party's Deutsche Zeitung stated that the government's action was unavoidable in terms of national responsibility. According to reports, this is the only newspaper among the government and party newspapers that fully supports this action, as Prime Minister Brüning is the leader of this party. The more moderate right-wing Deutsche Tageszeitung stated that the management of taxes is one of the basic rights of the National Assembly in a representative democracy, and that the German National Assembly has suffered a major blow. The National People's Party's Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger, while dissatisfied with the government's action, still sees it as the end of parliamentarianism. The conservative Berliner Post deeply regrets the President's hasty signing and lack of scrutiny, saying that the responsibility for this matter should be borne jointly by the cabinet and the National Party. The monarchist Kreuzzeitung welcomed this action, seeing it as a victory for the President. The Social Democratic Party's Vorwärts regrets that the Prime Minister did not try to negotiate and agree with the party, but instead resorted to this extreme measure.</p>
<h3>The British Parliament's Disturbance</h3>
<p>Labour's Left-Wing MP Snatches Mace and Flees</p>
<p>Unprecedented in Parliamentary History</p>
<p>London, 17th Dispatch from the Associated Press - During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, after a left-wing Labour MP strongly criticized the government's declaration on the Indian issue, Prime Minister MacDonald proposed suspending the MP, Brockway, from attending. Thereupon, the left-wing MPs became greatly angered and stirred up trouble. MP, Pickering, even snatched the parliamentary mace and fled, only to be wrestled by the Sergeant-at-Arms, who recovered this sacred object of history. Later, the entire House passed a motion to indefinitely suspend Pickering from attending with 324 votes against 4. This disturbance is unprecedented in the history of the British Parliament, shocking those who heard of it. All political parties also strongly condemned Mr. Pickering's rudeness.</p>
<h3>Mexico Rejects Foreigners Entering the Country</h3>
<p>Must Prove Their Legality</p>
<p>Our Compatriots Are the First to Be Affected</p>
<p>Mexico City, 18th Dispatch from the Associated Press - The Mexican government has issued an order requiring all foreigners who have recently moved into Mexico to prove the legality of their entry. Those affected by this order are mostly Russians and Chinese. If these people are found to have not gone through legal entry procedures, they will all be ordered to leave the country. It is said that many people have already been found without legal passports.</p>
<h3>The British Reply to the European Union Plan Is Ambiguous</h3>
<p>Deeply Concerned about Reducing the League of Nations' Authority</p>
<p>London, 17th Dispatch from Reuters - Britain has now replied to French Foreign Minister Briand's memorandum on a closer alliance in European politics in a sympathetic tone, but is concerned that this new system may reduce the effectiveness and authority of the League of Nations and lead to increasing hostility between continents. The British government believes that if this proposal is fully incorporated into the structure of the League of Nations, Briand's ideal can be effectively guaranteed. Therefore, the British government suggests that the French memorandum be included in the agenda of the next League Assembly. The reply also stated that the British government and the governments of overseas self-governing territories must give this memorandum careful and lengthy consideration.</p>
<p>London, 17th Dispatch from the Associated Press - European countries have all replied to Briand's European Federal Plan. The last to reply was the British government. Originally, it was intended to send only an acknowledgment of receipt, but the plan was suddenly changed. The original text was published here tonight. Previously, London newspapers expected the British government's reply to be unfavorable, but now it has not expressed this intention, so the public is quite surprised by this. The article initially stated that the British government had reviewed Mr. Briand's plan, but felt that the matter was important and must be carefully studied with the governments of the various territories before a decision could be made. However, this discussion has not yet been completed, and the deadline for the French government's reply on July 15 has arrived. Therefore, what is said in this dispatch can only be regarded as experimental in nature. The article stated that the British government is eagerly supporting European economic cooperation, but believes that this new combination must not go beyond the scope of the League of Nations structure, and it is especially necessary to understand that the British Empire has a global nature.</p>
<h3>Irwin Allows Two Indians to Visit Gandhi in Prison</h3>
<p>Bombay's Commerce Still Shows No Sign of Improvement</p>
<p>Ten Cotton Mills Are About to Close</p>
<p>Shimla, 17th Dispatch from Reuters - After correspondence between Governor-General Irwin and Indians Sapru and Jayakar, the Governor-General has agreed to allow Sapru and Jayakar to visit Gandhi and the Nehru father and son in prison, so that they can advise them to restore peace. The Governor-General has repeatedly stated the government's willingness for Indian self-government, but within the scope where Indians are not yet able to take full responsibility, Britain will temporarily provide guarantees. Sapru and Jayakar will be responsible for negotiating with Gandhi on their own.</p>
<p>Bombay, 17th Dispatch from Reuters - The Governor of Bombay, Sykes, spoke in the Bombay Legislative Council today, bitterly criticizing the behavior of non-violent resisters, saying that Bombay Province is gradually entering an economic crisis due to their bad activities, and that there is no question of negotiating with those who aim to destroy an orderly government.</p>
<p>Bombay, 17th Dispatch from Reuters - Ten cotton mills affiliated with Sassoon &amp; Co. have indicated that if commercial conditions show no sign of improvement, they intend to temporarily close down from August 15. This matter will involve 20,000 workers.</p>
<p>Washington, 18th Dispatch from the Associated Press - Senator Blaine today introduced a bill in the Senate, saying that India has indeed entered a state of revolution. The Senate should ask the State Department to come forward as a mediator in this matter. The measures taken by the British government's representatives to India have not been entirely satisfactory. If the United States is responsible for acting as a mediator, it must first consider the rights of the Indians. Blaine also said that reading Miller's inspection report on India, transmitted by the Associated Press, it can be determined that the current situation there has indeed become serious. If Britain can abandon India on its own, and the United States also follows suit and liberates the Philippines, then the much-discussed London Naval Treaty will not need to exist. The Indian National Congress has now established an agency here to promote the party's ideology.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Government Sends Senators to Limit Debate on the Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Washington, 17th Dispatch from the Associated Press - Government senators in the Senate who are working to pass the London Naval Treaty are now planning to propose two motions in order to achieve early ratification: (1) limit the debate time of each senator to one hour; (2) propose that all senators unanimously agree to vote on the Naval Treaty on Tuesday next week (the 22nd). The purpose of this motion is to give the opposing parties the opportunity to consider their vote, and to avoid being swayed by empty rhetoric. Another dispatch - A group of people assisting the London Naval Treaty stated this afternoon that they intend to extend the Senate's meeting today into the night in order to promote an early vote and achieve the goal of victory. There are already 20 people who have signed the petition to limit the debate time of each senator. As a rule, this petition only needs 16 signatures to be sufficient.</p>
<h3>France's Revenue Exceeds Budget Last Month</h3>
<p>Paris, 17th Dispatch from Reuters - France's revenue in June totaled 3,093,000,000 francs, an increase of 51,000,000 francs over the budget.</p>
<h3>Japan's Tariff Revenue Decreases</h3>
<p>Small and Medium-Sized Factories Close One After Another</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from the Electric News Agency - Tariff revenue since January of this year is recorded in the Ministry of Finance's accounting book. Since the beginning of the year, it has gradually decreased. Among them, in May, only 11,184,000 yuan was collected, a decrease of 2,282,000 yuan compared with the same period last year. Conversely, the tax amount per 100 yuan of taxable goods reached 19 yuan, 8 jiao, and 1 fen, which can be said to be a very heavy tax compared with 17 yuan and 3 jiao in the same period last year. This is because although ad valorem taxes are reduced due to falling prices, specific taxes are not related to this and are still taxed as before.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from the Electric News Agency - The Miyazaki Prefecture Tojo Silk Reeling Association has decided to close down for one month starting from August 1. At that time, about 1,000 workers will be unemployed. The Aichi Prefecture Raw Silk Industry Association has also decided to close down for one month starting from August 1. In addition, the same suspension of production is popular everywhere. The number of unemployed workers in small and medium-sized factories is increasing day by day, and the voices of difficulty in life are becoming increasingly loud.</p>
<p>Osaka, 18th Dispatch from the Electric News Agency - Suffering from overproduction, the Osaka factory of the Japanese Celera Larmodas Automobile Company announced a temporary closure for one week starting on the 21st. During the closure, workers will be paid half of their allowances.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Cabinet Decides to Implement New Budget Savings</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from the Japanese News Agency - The amount of budget savings to be implemented in the Showa 5th year has been decided at today's cabinet meeting as follows and will be implemented by each ministry: Ministry of Foreign Affairs 573,954, Ministry of Home Affairs 8,041,077, Ministry of Finance 2,859,352, Ministry of Army 10,091,826, Ministry of Navy 20,005,484, Ministry of Justice 1,095,954, Ministry of Education 2,343,021, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 1,207,522, Ministry of Commerce and Industry 794,418, Ministry of Communications 13,361,421, Ministry of Colonial Affairs 289,097, totaling 60,518,136 yuan.

<p>Reduction amount 19,444,624, Deferred payment amount 41,073,512, totaling 60,518,136.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from the Electric News Agency - As a result of the contact between Finance Minister Inoue and the Ministries of the Army and Navy, looking at the revenue performance during the four, five, six, and three months of the current year's budget savings, the figures are unexpectedly poor. If this trend continues for the next nine months, even if 60 million yuan is saved, it will still be difficult to make up for it. It is said that 7 million yuan will be freed up from special accounting, but there is still a shortage of more than 10 million yuan. This is the observation of experts in the Budget Bureau. What Finance Minister Inoue's plans are in this regard is most noteworthy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from the Japanese News Agency - The guidelines for compiling the Showa 6th year budget have been decided at today's regular cabinet meeting as follows: (1) Strive to implement savings in established expenses in the Showa 6th year; (2) New items will generally not be requested; (3) The public debt plan will follow the established guidelines; (4) The Ministry of Finance will draft a separate plan for the savings in established expenses, which will be decided by the cabinet; (5) Each special account will generally share the pension burden after the Showa 6th year; (6) The general estimate for the Showa 6th year will be submitted on August 15th of the Showa 5th year; (7) Each special account should handle the general estimate in accordance with the preceding item and submit it by August 31st.</p>

<h3>External Report on Recent Diplomatic Trends</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Bao Jing'an of the Information Department to the Central Broadcasting Station this morning (the 18th) to report on the recent diplomatic situation as follows:</p>
<p>"In the past week, the diplomatic aspects had quite important content. There are roughly the following types of events: (1) Sino-Russian Negotiations: Currently, the Chinese representative in Moscow is still in contact with Karakhan and may make further negotiations. As for the current negotiations regarding the release of overseas Chinese detained in Russia, a brief report can also be made. Recently, the Foreign Affairs Department received a report from the Consul-General in Vladivostok, stating that it had received a letter from the Russian negotiator stationed in Vladivostok, saying that except for 23 overseas Chinese who were still in custody due to criminal sanctions, all other overseas Chinese had been released. However, after investigation, the families of the overseas Chinese who the Russian side claimed to have been released firmly stated that they had not been released. Therefore, it is quite difficult to investigate for a while. As for the reasons why the investigation is not easy, there are roughly the following types: (1) After the overseas Chinese are detained, when their families report to the German Consulate and the Chinese Consulate, the names and Russian transliterations are often inconsistent, or even the overseas Chinese fabricate false names to avoid certain suspicions after being detained, resulting in the Russian side not being able to find the person after several investigations based on the list sent by our consulate. (2) After the Russian side detains the overseas Chinese, it first asks for their names, ages, etc., compiles a list, and assigns code numbers. From then on, it refers to them by code number. When sending them to work elsewhere, it calls out their code numbers and sends them separately. Overseas Chinese who are unwilling to go to work elsewhere often secretly change code numbers, so that although their relatives know for sure that they are in a certain place, the Russian side's investigation according to code number often does not match the names. (3) When overseas Chinese who were originally detained in a certain place are sent to work elsewhere, some escape midway, and some return to the country privately after being released because they are closer to the border. The individuals themselves and their relatives often do not report to the consulate, so it is impossible to verify whether the overseas Chinese have regained their freedom for a while. (4) After the overseas Chinese are detained, their relatives and friends may have reported to the consulate, but when the consulate inquires at the address of the relatives and friends, they have either returned to the country or moved elsewhere, making it impossible to investigate. The above situations are the most difficult reasons for this negotiation. Currently, our consulates in Russia are re-investigating thoroughly in order to jointly negotiate and achieve the purpose of releasing the detained overseas Chinese. As for the negotiation to return the detained overseas Chinese's property, according to a letter from the Russian negotiator, it has been confiscated by the customs according to the example of attempted smuggling. After active negotiations by our Consul-General in Vladivostok, the Russian side finally agreed that except for the property carried by overseas Chinese who returned to the country through Vladivostok and deemed to be smuggled by the customs, which cannot be returned according to law, all other property seized during the road case should be returned together, except for contraband. Currently, our Consul-General in Vladivostok has opened a list and asked the Russian side to return the items that should be returned first, so that they can be transferred to the original owners, and the rest will be negotiated later. (2) League of Nations Issues: The 11th General Assembly of the League of Nations has been scheduled to be held in Geneva on September 11 this year. In order for our country to be elected as a member of the Council at this session, we have ordered Minister Wu in the United States and ministers in other countries to contact the governments of the countries where they are stationed. According to reports, more and more countries are sympathetic to our country's election this time, and there is a good chance of being elected this time. As for the candidates for representatives of our country to the General Assembly, the National Government specially appointed Ministers Wu Chaochu, Jiang Zuobin, and Gao Lu as members on the 11th. At last year's League of Nations General Assembly, China was also represented by the three ministers, who made great achievements. In particular, Minister Wu advocated the implementation of Article 19 of the League Covenant, which is closely related to our country's abolition of unequal treaties. Therefore, the three ministers will be sent to attend this session. As for the credentials, the National Government can issue them in a few days and send them separately by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Affairs Department has already telegraphed the Chinese representative office of the League of Nations to inform the League of Nations Secretariat of the situation of the designated representatives. (3) Protection of Overseas Chinese and Party Affairs: (1) Japan: It is found that Japan has recently been declining in both industry and commerce, and factories and commercial institutions have been implementing layoffs and reducing government, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed workers in Japan. As a result, Chinese workers in Japan are also affected. In order to protect its own workers, the Japanese government has imposed extremely strict restrictions on the entry of Chinese workers, and has even deported Chinese workers. Therefore, in addition to ordering Minister Wang in Japan to raise serious negotiations with the Japanese government based on the principle of reciprocity in order to achieve the purpose of canceling restrictions, the Foreign Affairs Department also separately ordered the Minister in Japan and the Consuls-General in Yokohama, Kobe, and Korea to investigate unemployed Chinese workers in Japan, try to send them back to China in batches, and inform coastal provinces to investigate and prohibit traffickers from sending workers abroad, so as to avoid vagrancy and to prevent the establishment of facts. (2) British Malaya: Since Governor Kim Wen-tai of Singapore banned activities with high-pressure means, the Foreign Affairs Department telegraphed the Minister in England and the Consul-General in Singapore to conduct strict negotiations with the British government and the New Territories authorities, respectively. The British Colonial Office is still investigating. Recently, the local government of Muar in British Malaya has arrested party members. The Foreign Affairs Department has protested the case. (3) Dutch East Indies: The Dutch East Indies' oppression of party affairs is roughly the same as that of the British East Indies. The use of party doctrine textbooks in Chinese schools has always been prohibited. After repeated negotiations by the Foreign Affairs Department with the embassy in the Dutch East Indies and the Consul-General in Java, they have now allowed the free import of party doctrine books. As for the restriction that members of the Party Department cannot hold teaching positions, it also stems from the Dutch Governor's ban. The Consul-General in Java, Zhang, is actively negotiating with the Dutch Governor. (4) Establishment of Consulates in Nicaragua, Central America: There are many Chinese residents operating in Nicaragua. Because our country has not yet signed a treaty with Nicaragua and has not yet exchanged envoys, there is no establishment of a consulate, and the overseas Chinese also lack proper protection. The Foreign Affairs Department has now obtained the consent of the Nicaraguan government to establish a consulate, and has ordered Li Shizhong, the Acting Agent in Panama, to personally go to Nicaragua to investigate the situation. (5) Siam: Recently, the Foreign Affairs Department reported that 29 people were arrested at the May 1st Commemoration Day celebration held by the branch in Siam. After the branch tried to negotiate, all were released on bail pending trial. It is found that the Siamese government has repeatedly interfered in the affairs of overseas Chinese and has repeatedly requested improvements, but the other party has always replied with empty words without any results. The May 1st Labor Day is a world-wide holiday, and commemorative speeches are a matter of customary practice. Why should they be arrested at will? Although they have been released on bail, the original case has not been dismissed, which is very inappropriate. The Foreign Affairs Department has telegraphed Minister Wang in Japan to protest to the Siamese Ambassador in Japan."</p>
<h3>Xu Zushan Talks about Receiving Weihai</h3>
<p>Details of the Reception Have Been Negotiated and Compromised</p>
<p>It Will Be Managed According to the City System after Reception</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication - After the Sino-British signing of the Weihaiwei Return Agreement, the Central Commission appointed Xu Zushan as the Special Commissioner for the Reception of Weihai and set October 1 as the date for implementation of the reception. After receiving the order, Mr. Xu went to Weihai in person last month to investigate the local situation in Weihai and to negotiate the details of the reception with the British Minister in Weihai. Mr. Xu has been in Weihai for more than 20 days. The results of the contact were very satisfactory. Now that the matter is over, he took the Kyodo Maru No. 21 from Weihai and arrived in Qingdao today (14th) and stayed at the Naval Jianxing Society on Zhongshan Road. I especially went to visit him. Mr. Xu's conversation is as follows: "The most important purposes of my visit to Weihai this time are about two items. First, the return of Weihai. What is stipulated in the central treaty is all a general outline, and all paper items need to be specified in detail with the British Minister in Weihai. During my stay in Weihai for more than 20 days, I met with the British Minister in Weihai, Johnston, several times. Mr. Johnston was able to be open and honest about all the procedures, and the details of the reception were negotiated and compromised by both parties. There will be no difficulties when receiving in the future. Second, investigate the situation of the British administration of Weihai and the local conditions in preparation for the reception and to predetermine the policy after the reception. I found that the area is small and it is a free trade port. Commerce is not very developed. After the reception, attention must be paid to finance. Under the British administration of the area, the British government had a specific subsidy, so it was able to maintain the status quo. The area originally stationed a regiment of British troops, now only about 100 people left. After the reception, they can be withdrawn within one month as stipulated in the treaty. However, the security issue after the recovery must be properly handled to avoid giving people an excuse. As for municipal affairs, it is necessary to report to the central government for instructions before they can be stipulated. Roughly speaking, it should be handled in accordance with the city organization law promulgated by the central government." It is heard that Mr. Xu intends to stay in Qing for a short time and then take a wheel south to report everything to the central government (July 14).</p>
<h3>Plans for Guangdong Province to Issue Post-War Recovery Bonds</h3>
<p>Totaling 15 Million Yuan to be Sold in Four Tranches</p>
<p>Weekly Interest of 8 Percent, Secured by Provincial Revenue</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has suffered from years of war, with huge military expenses. The financial authorities often lament their empty coffers. The miscellaneous taxes borne by the people have not yet been lifted. After the resolution of the Guangxi war, it was thought that Guangdong Province could recuperate. Unexpectedly, soon after the Guangxi affair was settled, there was a major battle in southern Hunan. After the Hunan war came to an end, the remaining troops of the Guangxi army retreated back to Guangxi, and the Eighth Route Army returned west, and now Guangxi Province has once again become a place of continuous war. As a result, Guangdong Province's supplies are almost exhausted. The entire province's administrative expenses have been affected. Recently, the Finance Department has strictly limited the Chamber of Commerce to clear the military bonds sold by various shops within a week. However, the total amount of these military bonds is 4 million yuan, which has been sold by various parties, and it is said that they will soon be cleared. In order to cope with the current situation, the Finance Department recently plans to issue 15 million yuan of local post-war recovery bonds for the 19th year of the Republic of China, in the name of handling post-war affairs and maintaining the central banknotes. The Finance Department has drafted a statement of opinions, which will be submitted to the provincial affairs meeting for review and implementation tomorrow (the 15th). Judging from the current situation, this proposal should be passed and implemented, because the military situation is still pressing, and there is an urgent need for funds, and various 5-yuan and 10-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank also need to be restored to cash payment. Without specific funds, it is really difficult to cope with. The following is the statement of reasons for issuing the post-war recovery bonds drafted by the Finance Department: Since this province launched troops to suppress the rebellion in May of last year, it has been more than a year. Expenditures have increased sharply due to military affairs, and income has been shortened due to military affairs. All the assets of the national and provincial treasuries are still insufficient to supply military expenses. Therefore, advance collection of taxes, advance borrowing of various taxes, issuance of military bonds, additional collection of one-tenth of silver coins, and raising industrial rent have been used. Everything that can raise funds has been done. However, it is like a cup of water trying to put out a burning cart of wood, and it dries up before it is full. Although the military affairs in the two Guangs have come to an end, the amount of supplies and pay has not decreased. Bonds and borrowing are difficult to repay, and tax deductions are not enough. If no measures are taken as soon as possible, the provincial treasury will be exhausted, and the administration will be suspended. How can we take care of the aftermath? It is found that the payment orders issued by this department before the end of June this year, but not yet paid, amount to more than 1.1 million yuan. The expenses of various agencies in June that should be issued payment orders are no less than 1 million yuan. In addition, the necessary administrative expenses in July are more than 1 million yuan, and the funds for the principal and interest of military bonds paid on behalf of the national treasury for military expenses require about 1.7 million yuan. The total amount of funds to be paid by the provincial treasury is 5.34 million yuan. The total amount of funds that can be collected in July, such as fundraising and taxes, is about 1.1 million yuan, which is not enough to pay the various payment orders issued before the end of June. As for the administrative expenses for June and July, the military expenses for July, and the bond funds, etc., at least 4.23 million yuan are required, and it is not known where to get it from. This is only in terms of July. In the future, the implementation of the elimination of taxes will reduce more than 1 million yuan per month, and the difficulty is even more unknown. I believe that the way to manage finances is nothing more than increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. At this time, all industries are declining and the people are exhausted. It is not easy to implement new taxes. Even the sand fields being cleared and organized everywhere and the declaration of farmland may not increase income, but the effect is not visible, and it is too slow to solve the urgent need. Although there is room for savings in the administrative expenses of this province, the military expenses have not been reduced. Even if the administrative expenses can be reduced to the lowest limit, it is still not enough to help the matter, and because the value of the central currency is low, and the financial activities of the Central Bank have not yet started, there is no way to contribute. After repeated deliberations, the only feasible way is to continue to borrow from merchants and people. The only problem is that the old debts have not been cleared, and new debts have accumulated. The first, second, and third-phase public bonds and financial bonds borrowed from foreign banks and local banks amount to no less than 30 to 40 million yuan. If it is not cleared for a long time, the credibility of merchants and people to the government has long been weak, and there is no considerable collateral or definite guarantee. It is very difficult to get them to actively respond. However, if you want to give up this and make other plans, you really have no long-term strategy. The only way to deal with the current situation is to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to find a way to clear the old debts to restore the previous credibility, and to raise funds from the Ministry to replenish the treasury and repay the new debts, and at the same time maintain the banknotes and consolidate the finance. It is planned to issue 15 million yuan of Guangdong post-war recovery bonds in the 19th year of the Republic of China. (The following is omitted) Attached: Regulations on post-war recovery bonds. Article 1: This bond is named Guangdong Post-War Recovery Bond, and the principal and interest are guaranteed by the revenue of the Guangdong Provincial Treasury.

However, those who pay within the aforementioned time limit will be allowed to deduct handling fees as follows: (A) The first phase, before September 15th, deduct 5%; (B) The second phase, before October 15th, deduct 4%; (C) The third phase, before November 15th, deduct 3%; (D) The fourth phase, after November 16th, deduct 2%.

Article 10: This bond is set as unregistered. Article 11: This bond is divided into four types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan, but a part of the 5 yuan bond is made into five shares, each share is 1 yuan, so as to facilitate the distribution of odd numbers. Article 12: This bond may be freely mortgaged and traded, and may be used as a guarantee reserve for banks, and other public guarantees.

<h3>Verdict in the Case of Postal Workers Transporting Opium in Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Two cases of personnel from the Liaoning-Ningbo Postal Administration trafficking in opium have been tried by the court for many days, and the verdicts have now been announced. One case was the discovery of empty bags, and the other was the exposure of a contract. The first group of defendants, Shen Tianjue, Zhao Guofeng, and Han Shuren, were found guilty based on the empty opium bags, and the facts of the crime were obvious. Shen Tianjue was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan. Zhao Guofeng and Han Shuren were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment and fined 400 yuan. The second group of defendants, Du Shichang, Zhang Fengchi, and Xu Jingyi, were found guilty based on the contract. Du Shichang has admitted that the contract was written by him, and Zhang and Xu also admitted that there was a contract. However, they argued that the contract was for transporting soil or selling green vegetables and fruits. The court judged the meaning of the contract and believed that it was definitely not for green vegetables and fruits, and there was no doubt that it was for transporting opium. Although it is not known how many times they continued to transport, according to Du Shichang's defense, the contract was not actually implemented. According to normal business, it is necessary to prepare everything before signing a contract, and there is a clause that it has already come into effect, so it should be considered completed, not attempted. Therefore, Du Shichang and Zhang Fengchi were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan, and Xu Jingyi was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and fined 100 yuan. It is said that Shen, Du, and others are not satisfied and will appeal. (11th)</p>
<h3>Xu Xiongzhang Talks About the Russian Confiscation of Overseas Chinese Property</h3>
<p>Houses Allowed to be Claimed Within Six Months</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Overseas Chinese Still Working in Russia</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: At 2:30 this afternoon, Xu Xiongzhang, the Consul General in Vladivostok, Russia, arrived in Harbin to pick up his family. Xu took office in early February of this year. After taking office, he was handling the matter of the confiscation of overseas Chinese property. He has already made some progress in the negotiations. He will stay in Harbin for about two or three days, and then return to his post. The reporter met him at his friend Lu Tai's place. Xu talked about the process of handling the return of overseas Chinese property as follows: First of all, there were about 200 houses in Vladivostok owned by overseas Chinese, with a total value of more than 3 million Russian rubles. After the Sino-Russian Incident on July 11th last year, Russia ordered the arrest of homeowners. Most of the overseas Chinese owners were arrested and imprisoned, and the rest fled back to their home countries. All 200 houses were managed by the Vladivostok Municipal Bureau, and it was announced that if no one claimed them within six months from the date of confiscation, they would be confiscated. In fact, this kind of officialdom was just a means to cover up their looting. The overseas Chinese who fled back to their home countries did not dare to claim them, and those who were imprisoned had no way to claim them. As a result, only a empty favor was given. Later, the Khabarovsk Agreement was signed, and the imprisoned overseas Chinese were released. Some of them went to the Municipal Bureau to claim their property. The Russian side did not want to go back on its word because the six-month deadline had not yet expired, so it returned the property. It is estimated that about 100 houses were claimed. The remaining 30 or so houses were still managed by the Municipal Bureau on behalf of the owners because the owners had returned to their home countries and no one came to claim them. Xu took office this spring. As the six-month deadline was approaching, he negotiated with the Russian side to extend the deadline for claiming. He obtained Russian permission to start counting six months from the date of the Khabarovsk Agreement. Xu took office about four or five months after the Khabarovsk Agreement was signed. If he followed the procedures to notify the owners to come and claim them, there would not be much time left. Therefore, he still contacted the Russian side and negotiated to check the number of unclaimed houses, conclude an agreement, and from the date of the agreement, recruit people to claim them, or allow them to entrust someone to claim them. If no one came to claim them after six months, Russia would be allowed to confiscate them. This method seems to be appropriate. Xu will handle it when he returns to his post from Harbin. As for the overseas Chinese in Russia, there are still more than 20,000 people, all of whom maintain their livelihoods by working. The Russian side benefits from their diligence and cheap wages, and is more willing to hire them, so the Chinese workers can still support their lives. The abuse is not as serious as rumored outside. As for the exit passport, the procedures are troublesome. This is not only the case for overseas Chinese, but also for overseas citizens of other countries. (11th)</p>

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Liquor Case Appealed: Zhou Weixin's liquor shop outside Ximen was previously reported to the Public Security Bureau by Jin and others for selling liquor. The case of searching and suing each other has been heard by the county government. The seized liquor has been sent to the Shanghai Central Health Experiment Institute for testing, and it has been found to be non-toxic. Now, Zhou has filed an appeal with the High Court due to heavy losses. The High Court has accepted the case and will extract the entire case file from the county for review and handling soon.</p>
<p>Change of Autonomous Region: The autonomous region of this county was originally divided into eight districts. Now, due to the disparity in the size of the regions, there are many obstacles. (That is, in terms of funding, the smaller ones only have more than 40 yuan per month, and the income is insufficient. It has been in arrears for several months.) The county administrative meeting has previously decided to submit a request to the Civil Affairs Department for approval to change the case and re-divide it. The Department has approved it, but it should be implemented after the citizens of each district swear in and register, and the election of township heads is completed to avoid disputes. The plan to divide the six districts proposed by the former District Committee has been sent to the Department for record.</p>
<h3>Chuansha</h3>
<p>Director of Construction Bureau Abandons Post and Flees: Li Jingzhao (Guangdong native), the Director of the Construction Bureau of Chuansha County, has been commissioned to Chuansha for a year and a half since last spring. He has been working diligently, but he is addicted to opium, and it is inconvenient to smoke, so he often stays in Shanghai. In May of this year, the county party department sent a letter to the county government requesting that Li be transferred for inspection. Li went to the county to request a postponement of the date, so that he could go to Shanghai for medical treatment. Later, County Magistrate Ruan approved the postponement until the 15th of this month to come to the county for inspection. After receiving the order, Li continued to work as usual. Unexpectedly, he went to Shanghai at the end of last month and never returned. The heads of the technical section, Sun Songxian, and the general affairs section, Zhang Luo, went to Shanghai one after another to investigate at Li's relatives and friends, but found nothing. After returning without results, the staff of the bureau consulted and decided that the matter was too important to be covered up, so they went to the county to report at about 7 pm on the 17th and requested instructions on how to deal with it. County Magistrate Ruan ordered the important staff in the bureau to provide guarantees and wait outside for instructions. Only Wu Weiyuan, a native of Guangdong, who was in charge of general affairs in the bureau, was not guaranteed and was ordered to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for temporary custody. Early in the morning of the 18th, Zhong Menglin, a member of the second section and concurrently an accountant, was sent to the Construction Bureau to check the files, accounts, and equipment. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to send two policemen to guard the bureau. Also, the construction funds stored in the Shanghai Bank of Communications were very large, about 18,000 yuan. Fearing that there would be a case of forging seals and stealing, he took a car to Shanghai on the morning of the same day (18th) to inquire about everything.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Problem of the Chamber of Commerce Stopping Activities: The Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce is reorganizing according to the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, and has submitted a request to the county party department for registration. The party department ordered the General Chamber of Commerce to maintain the status quo for the time being because the guilds of various industries are currently undergoing reorganization. Recently, the provincial party department decided that all old chambers of commerce should stop activities and be received or managed by the local party departments. As a result, fundamental problems have arisen in the Chamber of Commerce. It is heard that the local Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce yesterday, and has submitted a request to the provincial department for explanation on the remaining matters. However, the local Chamber of Commerce has not yet made a statement.</p>
<p>Negligence of Steamboat Sailor Caused Disaster: The Laogongmao steamboat traveling to and from Suzhou Mudong has wharfs to rely on in Hengtang, Xikuatang, etc. On the 17th, Zhao Yuan, the wife of Ma Sanbao, who lived in Xitang, took the steamboat from the city to return home. When the steamboat reached Xikuatang, the sailor saw that only Zhao Yuan was getting off the boat, so he was lazy and did not bring the boat close to the wharf, and only drove slowly without stopping. At that time, Zhao Yuan was carrying a heavy burden and could not jump far, so she lost her footing and fell on the wharf board, and both feet fell into the water. Seeing this, the steamboat started to dock. Unexpectedly, one of Zhao Yuan's feet was crushed by the boat, and she fainted from the pain. After being helped back home, she soon died of her injuries. After her death, blue marks were also found on her abdomen and chest, and the situation was terrible.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Silk Factory Disturbance of Unclear Truth There are a total of forty-nine silk factories in the city. In Lihua Village outside the North Gate, there are Yuanfeng, Wanyi, and Yiyi factories. In Zhou Shanbang, there are Wufeng, Deda, Yuchang, and Ruichang factories. Yesterday morning (the 18th), after factories such as Yuanfeng and Wanyi called for a strike, only a small number of workers went to work. The rest gathered around the North New Bridge area, firmly refusing to work. The truth is unclear. The Yiyi factory, which originally made one-corner [yarn], continued to work as usual, but dismissed its workers after 9 a.m. When the female workers gathered at the North New Bridge, a rumor spread, and a group of female workers went to the Ruichang Silk Factory in Zhou Shanbang, persuading them to stop working. That factory stopped working immediately. It is unknown how, but a window was slightly damaged. The other Wufeng factory also stopped working, while Deda and Yu continued to work as usual. A group of female workers then entered that factory. With so many people and hands, it is unknown how, but the accounting room was destroyed. That factory also had to stop working. The situation was about to spread to the Qian Sheng Silk Factory under Gongyun Bridge, but fortunately, the police force was already on the scene, preventing it from spreading. Later, the female workers from each factory sent representatives to report to the Silk Factory Workers' Union, saying that when the management paid wages the day before yesterday (the 17th), they did not deduct union dues on their behalf, claiming that the union had been cancelled, and that they had increased the rent, which was contrary to the old agreement. This morning, a group of female workers misunderstood their words, leading to this misunderstanding. They requested a solution, etc. After receiving the report, the standing committee members of the union, Tao Shensheng, Hua Nianzu, and Ye Qiaoyun, immediately sent the investigation section to investigate, and also went to the county to meet with County Magistrate Sun, reporting everything, and instructing the sub-unions to resume work immediately. However, the female workers had already dispersed, and it was feared that they would not be able to resume work that day. The silk factories such as Deda and Yu also sent a letter to the Silk Factory Guild, requesting a solution. According to the factory side, this disturbance was actually caused by the spread of rumors. There was no ill will between labor and management. As for the destruction of Deda and Yu, it was because there was anger from the labor unrest last month, so resentment was unavoidable, leading to the repercussions. Whether it can be resolved depends on what happens today.</p>
<p>Detailed Record of the Dismissal of Patrol Chiefs Incident The third branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate of this city was stirred by a disturbance yesterday due to the dismissal of two patrol chiefs. It is learned that Wang Tingshu, the director of the branch bureau, had just taken office the day before yesterday and was handling matters with unusual haste. In the afternoon of that day at 4:00 p.m., after gathering all the chiefs and police for a roll call and speech, he dismissed patrol chief Zhang Shaofu and Chen Junhua, the patrol chief of the Second Police Station of Xiatang, in the evening, and wanted to dismiss six to nine patrol officers. Zhang and Chen, feeling they had been unfairly dismissed, immediately went to the Public Security Bureau to petition. Director Xu instructed them to be sent to the bureau and reassured to continue their duties. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, Zhang and Chen suddenly led a small number of police officers to the bureau, forcibly taking Director Wang out, claiming that everyone would go to the Public Security Bureau to speak. They were then escorted to the Public Security Bureau, shouting slogans such as "Down with Director Wang who uses private connections" along the way. Director Wang was injured in the chaos. Patrol chiefs Zhang Shaofu and Chen Junhua also suffered minor injuries. After both sides arrived at the Public Security Bureau, Director Xu ordered Director Wang to go to the Brothers Hospital for medical treatment first, and had Zhang and Chen watched. Unexpectedly, the patrol police outside the South Gate suddenly went on strike. Subsequently, Li Linshi, the director of the branch bureau, earnestly persuaded all the police officers, and they all returned to their posts. After the incident, Public Security Bureau Director Xu, in addition to sending Inspector Qian Tianxiong to the South Gate to conduct an on-site investigation, also ordered Li Linshi, a member of the bureau, to temporarily act as the director, and ordered Wu Quan and Liu Desheng, the patrol chiefs of the first and second branch bureaus, to be transferred to the South District to temporarily serve as patrol chiefs of the third branch bureau. At about 4:00 p.m., Director Wang and the two patrol chiefs, Zhang and Chen, all went to the county government to request an injury examination. Presiding Judge Yu opened a court for trial and ordered them all to return for medical treatment and await further handling after their injuries healed. Meanwhile, personnel were dispatched to investigate the truth of the incident.</p>
<p>Two Robberies Result in Seven Casualties Wang A'de, a farmer in Da'an Village near Wan'an Market, Sixteenth District, Xiyi, earned his living by farming and was poor. He had three sons and one daughter. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 p.m. the night before last, two robbers holding pistols and speaking with a northern accent suddenly broke into his house, forbidding any outcry, and demanding to know where the silver was hidden. They then ransacked the chests and cabinets, but found nothing. They fired a warning shot and left to the north. Wang A'de bravely chased after them and was shot three times by the robbers, falling to the side of a mound, barely alive. He was spotted by neighbors, who carried Wang back. His family hired a boat to send him to the city, but he died of his injuries yesterday morning. Also, at the home of Wu Kunshou, a farmer in Wuxiang, Bashi Bridge, Tianxia Market, Sixteenth District, more than ten robbers suddenly came the night before last, holding knives, sticks, and other weapons, breaking into the house and looting wildly. They stole 55 yuan in silver, 11 banknotes, one gold ring, clothing, etc. When the villagers heard the alarm, they immediately gathered and bravely pursued. The villagers were no match and six people, Wu Sanbao, Xinggen, Shoupeng, A'quan, Jinchang, and Hesheng, were injured by knives and sticks. After the police from the Twelfth Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrived, the robbers fled. One robber, Wang Fusheng, was captured by the police and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. Wu Kunshou and the six injured villagers came to the city yesterday afternoon to report their injuries to the county.

<p>Rice Shops Robbed in Xiqiao Xiqiao, located outside the East Gate, is only a short distance from the Public Security Bureau of the county government. At around 1:00 a.m. on the 16th, seven or eight robbers suddenly came from the back door of the Xu Wansheng Rice Shop, grabbing the mother of Xu Rongchen, the owner of the rice shop, and forcing her to hand over silver dollars.

<p>Provincial Order to Recover Tuition Fees from Student Police Who Caused Trouble The Civil Affairs Department received a report from Wang Dasui, the principal of the Police Academy, stating that on the 10th of this month, student police in the police training class were incited by a small number of people and suddenly went on strike, making demands. Now that the disturbance has subsided, it has been found that the student police led by Lu Wenyu and 16 others, except for Chen Sihai and Zhang Yunzhen who were leniently released, Bai Yushan, Zhou Guirong, and Li Cui, are on the run, and Chen Wenyu and 16 others have been handed over to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for investigation. Meanwhile, orders have been sent to various counties to recover clothing and tuition fees, and Lu Wenyu, the leader, is from Jiangyin, with the owner of Maofeng Store on Dongda Street, Lu Weiqing, as his guarantor. The Civil Affairs Department ordered County Magistrate Li to follow the instructions and recover the fees.</p>
<p>Striving to Abolish the Provincial Tax on Factory Cloth The factory cloth industry in Jiangyin has been developing for decades and is the best in Jiangsu Province. In recent years, the production capacity has weakened, and instead of seeking industrial development, the consumption capacity is strong, and foreign goods are purchased exclusively. In addition, there are many toll stations and heavy taxes. Jiangsu and Zhejiang are adjacent provinces, and transportation is convenient. A considerable amount of Jiangyin factory cloth is sold to Zhejiang. However, on May 1st of this year, Zhejiang Province specially set up a provincial tax bureau, and the import tax on factory cloth has increased from one to ten times. Qian Daren, the executive committee member of the Jiangyin Tonghui Factory Cloth Association, specially sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce through the County Chamber of Commerce, urging the Zhejiang provincial authorities to strive to abolish the provincial tax on factory cloth in order to maintain business and promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>Militiamen Misunderstand and Injure Police Officer County Magistrate Li received a secret report from Qiu Wubao, Zhang A'yu, Zhang Zitian, and 50 other people from Qiugangpai Village, Qiaoqi Township, stating that Zhu Linrui, the eldest son of Zhu Shaohong, a famous doctor in Fenggezhuang, who is serving as a tax collector, has embezzled public funds, additionally charged eight points, harbored gambling dens, colluded with the Baowei Tuan (Local Militia) Da Li and Xiao Li, and sold opium, etc. County Magistrate Li then issued a hand order to the Public Security Bureau, ordering Fan Yu, a patrol officer from the Sanguan Public Security Second Police Station, to go to Qiaoqi with four plainclothes police officers on the morning of the 16th to investigate whether Qiu Wubao was there. Two opium smokers, Xu Minggui and Zhao Xiaogen, were caught on the street. Zhao Xiaogen escaped after reaching the Tenth District Office. After contacting District Chief Xu Lianqu, they went to the Baowei Tuan. It was already 1:00 a.m. Li Liangbi, the outer guard, asked for the password because Fan and others were wearing plain clothes. Later, Lu Guanhao, the new coach, explained the reason. Patrol Officer Fan entered and searched the positions of the militiamen, but found no opium. Then they went to the district office. The Baowei Tuan searched in plain clothes and did not see any official documents. When they asked for the documents, Fan hid the documents in his bag and they were snatched away by Lai Mingchu, a member of the militia. In the chaos, Fan was beaten, suffering minor injuries to his right rib and left neck. District Chief Xu stopped them and sent Fan to the home of Zhen Chief Xu Weizu. Fan also lost his pistol and other items. Yesterday morning (the 17th), after District Chief Xu reported to County Magistrate Li, he sent the police team Ma Huaizhong to the countryside to investigate. Patrol Officer Fan was sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. In the afternoon, Ma's team returned to the city and brought militiamen Li Liangbi and Lai Mingchu to the city to be interrogated by the county.</p>

<p>Jiangbei Highway Bus Operation Undertaken by Merchants The long-distance buses on each line under the Jiangbei Highway Bureau were previously contracted out to merchants by the Construction Department. There were four parties requesting to contract, and the Construction Department has now decided to grant the contract to two companies, one for inbound and one for outbound.</p>
<p>The Issue of Opening Human-Powered Rickshaws Zhenjiang has an quota of 1,000 human-powered rickshaws, with a current balance of 325. The method for opening them up is said to have been determined by the Construction Department, which sent personnel to investigate the situation and current status, and has decided to hand it over to the Chamber of Commerce. However, among the 325 rickshaws, 100 must be purchased by the rickshaw pullers themselves at a price.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Orders the Establishment of the Baowei Tuan (Local Militia) The Jiangdu County Government, in response to the provincial government's order to establish the Baowei Tuan, has been instructed to handle it automatically in each locality. According to the report, the county only has more than 200 members in the four rural areas, and the firearms are not fully equipped. Moreover, the rural farmers in the four rural areas have not yet opened their minds, and it is also the busy farming season, and the district offices are implementing citizen oath registration, making it difficult to handle. A special request was made to the provincial government to postpone it. It is heard that an instruction has been received, which states, "It is true that during the busy farming season, it is difficult to force the Tuan Ding who should be trained in each household to serve. However, the district's screening procedures can be carried out in accordance with the regulations. The district chiefs should still be strictly supervised to complete the reporting within the time limit."</p>
<p>The Fuyunfengshun Steamer Conflicts with the People The Jiangdu County Government previously reported to the Second District Office that the inland river water was vast, and the dikes on both sides of the area from Guazhou to Yangzi Bridge were severely damaged. Small steamers traveling back and forth would cause further damage, so it was requested that the county government follow the precedent of previous floods and inform the Zhenjiang Customs to strictly order each small steamer to stop and tow the ropes when passing through that area. Unexpectedly, the Fuyun Steamer Bureau's Fengshun small steamer passed through Yangzi Bridge at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 16th) and did not comply. Therefore, many people gathered there and forced it to stop, resulting in a conflict and mutual violence. A man named Ma Shidong was injured on the side of the people. The police team stationed there arrested Zhu Yintang, Ge Defa, Xu Xinmo, Hu Zhengtiao, and four other executives from the steamer, and sent them and the injured person to the court for legal resolution.</p>
<p>Another Batch of Wounded Soldiers Arrives The Twenty-Seventh Rear Hospital stationed in Yangzhou has transported wounded soldiers from the front line, totaling 833 people. Yesterday (the 15th), another batch of more than 500 people was transported from the front. The hospital here did not make prior arrangements for the treatment location for these wounded soldiers, so it was extremely busy temporarily. Subsequently, the county government temporarily designated the Yaoyang Match Factory in the South Gate as a temporary treatment location. This morning, County Magistrate Chen convened all the doctors of the Doctors' Association to find a way to send people to change dressings first.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Impersonating Military Officer The son of Wu Chengyi in this county, Wu Yushan, previously impersonated Wu Ji, the deputy director of the logistics management office of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters, and spread rumors everywhere. He was arrested by the 266th Regiment in Huaiyin. The telegraph ordered the First Company of the First Battalion stationed in You to search Wu's residence. The company immediately went to Wu's residence with the Public Security Bureau and found several military supplies. Wu Yushan's father was then released on bail. It is now heard that the headquarters is concerned that Wu Zhan dared to impersonate a senior military officer and may have other intentions. The telegraph ordered the regiment to escort Wu to Beijing for interrogation. After receiving the telegraph, Commander Huang ordered a military officer to lead a platoon of soldiers to escort Wu to You and temporarily imprison him in the county prison, awaiting orders to be escorted to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>The Panic of Villagers in Three Markets On the evening of the 13th, more than 100 people resembling new soldiers suddenly appeared in Xiaoying and other places on the north bank of the Yanhe River in the third district of Huaiyin. They had mismatched uniforms and various firearms. They came from Jiangjia Xiaowei in Siyang. For a time, the villagers were greatly alarmed and fled everywhere. The local village corps and the LianShui civil militia immediately joined forces and strengthened their defenses. The County Government Police Brigade and the Public Security Bureau repeatedly sent scouts to investigate and report that the group of bandits had come to negotiate surrender. Their leaders were said to be surnamed Lin or Dai. After inquiring from all sides, nothing was known beforehand, and the villagers were even more uneasy. Therefore, from Zhujiaji on the border of Huai and Lian in the east, to both sides of Dahong in the west, to Wangying Xiba in the south, and to Dingji in the north, within a radius of more than ten li, all the strong men and militia, numbering about a thousand or more, were armed and gathered to monitor them closely. Fortunately, there were no unexpected actions. It was not until the night of the 14th that the bandits left the north bank of the Yanhe River in the rain and fled to the fifth district. That night, the county police brigade also sent a cavalry patrol to assist the militia, and did not return until noon on the 15th. However, according to a report to the police brigade commander Zhu Lianfang, the group of bandits was still stationed in Caowei, north of Wulizhuang.</p>
<p>Military Police Conduct a Major Search Commander Huang of the 266th Regiment stationed in the area, because communist leaflets have been found in and out of Huaiyin County recently, and according to reports, there are many undesirable elements hiding, hoping to obstruct local security, sent a team to join the police brigade, public security bureau, and chamber of commerce at 3:00 a.m. on the 14th, dividing the city inside and outside into seven districts, to carry out a major search. They first gathered at the regiment headquarters and then searched separately. They also notified the wooden fences at the entrances of the streets and alleys inside and outside the city to open slowly. The search ended at dawn, and except for the discovery of a large number of opium cases, nothing else was found. It is heard that the officials are still not discouraged and may conduct a second or third search soon.</p>
<p>Zhongxing Town is Frightened Siyang County Zhongxing Town was originally a larger commercial port in Jiangbei, but after the Liu Weizhu Village, four miles west of the town, was broken by bandits, merchants and residents in the town have been unable to live in peace. Because the county seat is prosperous and has more thorough anti-bandit equipment, most of the middle-class families in Zhongzhen have moved to Siyang County to avoid bandits, except for the wealthiest who have moved to other counties.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The First Batch of Wounded Soldiers Arrives in Tong The Nantong Thirty-First Rear Hospital was established on the 16th, with Cao You as the director, Yu Housheng as the director of medical affairs, Lang Kezhong as the director of pharmacy, and Gao Liang, Liu Dazhong, etc. as military doctors. The first batch of more than 700 wounded soldiers arrived at Tianshenggang on the Daji Steamer on the 17th. The second batch of 800 soldiers is scheduled to arrive on the 19th.</p>
<p>Two Torpedo Boats Run Aground at Tianshenggang The Hupeng and Husun torpedo boats were pushed by strong winds and rapid tides onto the shoals of Tianshenggang on the morning of the 15th, making it difficult to move. Workers are currently being hired to use barges to try to transport them.</p>
<p>The County's Financial Difficulties The local finances of Nantong are not enough to cover expenses, reaching more than 70,000 yuan. The current temporary short-term loan of 50,000 yuan has not yet been borrowed. The previous loans have now expired. Because there is no money to repay, an agreement has been reached with the creditors to extend the term for six months. Construction funds must be diverted and repaid in installments after the next busy season begins.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Rugao City Declares Special Martial Law The county government, due to the serious situation of rampant bandits and communists in this county, announced special martial law on the 15th. The four city gates are closed every night at 8:00 p.m., and no one is allowed to pass through after 9:00 p.m. without a password. Traffic is cut off at 10:00 p.m., and visits to prisoners in the prison are restricted to prevent trouble.</p>
<p>The County-Run Farm is Attacked by Bandits At 10:00 p.m. on the 11th, the county-run farm in Zhongyi District, Rugao Jugang, was suddenly attacked by thirty to forty bandits, holding more than thirty rifles, to attack the garrison troops stationed at the farm. The Baowei Tuan (Local Militia) stationed there had been ordered to be transferred elsewhere the day before, and the staff of the farm had moved to Jugang due to the banditry. Therefore, the bandits did not commit any violence and fled to the southeast.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Order to Investigate False Accusations The names Zhao Wenzhao, Wu Gaowei, Shen Qiming, Lu Feicheng, Yang Sizhai, Gao Zhen, and Shen Zhenxin in Jiaxing accused County Magistrate Jiang Zhicheng of colluding with local bullies and engaging in embezzlement, and filed a complaint with the Civil Affairs Department, which sent personnel to thoroughly investigate. It was found that the allegations were mostly exaggerated and not true. The accusers were also not using their real names. The Civil Affairs Department believed that the false accusations should be thoroughly investigated and sent the original complaint and investigation report to the county, ordering County Magistrate Jiang to investigate the real names of the false accusers and send them to the County Local Court for investigation in accordance with the law, to warn against troublemakers. Mo Runxun, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, was also accused by Chen Wanzhong of this county in a letter to the Civil Affairs Department. He was ordered to accurately investigate the matter and report back before being stripped of his post. County Magistrate Jiang, because the accuser did not indicate his address and contact information, could not inquire, so he posted a notice yesterday, ordering the accuser Chen Wanzhong to report to the government in person within seven days to be questioned, so that the matter could be verified. If he fails to arrive after the deadline, he will be treated as a false accuser.</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting to Merge School Districts Jiaxing School District originally had 25 districts, with one school affairs committee member in each district to manage education in the entire district. Later, it was merged into nine districts, and school affairs in each district were managed by the autonomous committee members of that district. After the autonomy was suspended, the 25-district system was restored. Former Education Bureau Director Shen planned to divide it into eight school districts and appoint eight educators to preside over school affairs in the eight districts. Now, because the autonomous region has been determined to be seven districts, the current Director of Education, Jiang Jing, believes that the education district and the autonomous region must be consistent.</p>
<p>For the sake of less difficulty in handling affairs, he has already presented it to the provincial government, and a county education committee meeting will be convened to discuss the merger method, so that it can be implemented from the eighteenth year and benefit school affairs.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Execution of Kidnapper The kidnapper Ma Haitang, a native of Sheng County, had previously colluded with others to kidnap Qiu Shousong's ten-year-old younger brother, Qiu Shoubao, in the Zhangjia Temple area of that county, demanding 600 yuan for his release. He again gathered bandits on the evening of November 18th of the same year in Hengzha An Village, Lin'an County, and kidnapped Zhou Quanfa's six-year-old son, Zhou Bingsheng, demanding ransom in a letter to be negotiated near Shiheli, Yuhang County. They were intercepted by soldiers ambushing there, and a pistol and bullets were found. Zhou Bingsheng was then beaten to death with stones by the remaining bandits. The Second Company of the Special Affairs Battalion of the Security Team sent Ma Haitang to the Security Office, which transferred him to the court. He was sentenced to death. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the 18th, the prosecutor was sent to sign for the prisoner, verify his identity, and escort him to the execution ground outside Qingbo Gate for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>The Anti-Smuggling Bureau Reorganizes Camps into Teams Since Zhen Shaojie took over the Two Zhejiang Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Bureau, he has planned to reorganize the various camps into brigades, squadrons, and platoons in accordance with the anti-smuggling team organizational outline previously issued by the Ministry of Finance. A few days ago, Director Zhen went to Shanghai and asked Director Wen of the Anti-Smuggling Department of the Ministry of Finance about this matter, and it has been approved. Therefore, all camps are now ordered to follow the instructions, and the brigade commanders are appointed as follows: First Brigade Commander Shu Yan, Second Brigade Commander Ling Xichao, Third Brigade Commander Li Guogan, Fourth Brigade Commander Luo Qin, Fifth Brigade Commander Chen Shaohan, Sixth Brigade Commander Zhen Xiqiu, Seventh Brigade Commander Luo Zhuohan, Eighth Brigade Commander Zhu Xuchu, Ninth Brigade Commander Cai Qingjing, Tenth Brigade Commander Guo Yi.</p>
<p>Continued Allocation of Highway Public Bonds The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance previously used highway public bonds to borrow 300,000 yuan from various silver and money industries for construction needs, receiving 282,500 yuan in actual cash. It was to be repaid monthly from the construction funds that should be issued each month, with a term of ten months. Now, the term has not yet expired, but it is not far off. In addition to the 180,000 yuan that has been repaid, another 30,000 yuan was repaid yesterday, and a letter was sent to the silver and money industries to share the amount.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The 200,000 Municipal Loan Will Sign a Contract The Ningbo Municipal Government will continue to borrow a short-term construction public bond of 200,000 yuan, still using the wharf donation as collateral, with a monthly interest rate of 1.1%, and a term of seven years. It was later learned that the money industry agreed to lend 100,000 yuan, and the banking industry agreed to lend 75,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of 25,000 yuan, which the municipal government had to borrow from other industries. It is now heard that 15,000 yuan of the 25,000 yuan that was borrowed from other industries has been obtained as of the other day, leaving a shortfall of 10,000 yuan, which Mayor Yang has entrusted to Chairman Lin Qinxiang of the General Chamber of Commerce to borrow from the pharmacy industry. If this can be achieved, then after the contract is signed, it can be established. It is heard that the short-term construction public bonds that were previously collateralized by the wharf donation and the new 40,000 yuan loan that was collateralized by the vehicle donation must be deducted. In this way, the actual amount obtained by the municipal government is still a drop in the bucket and does not help the situation. As for the members of the Management Committee, Mayor Yang still insists on retaining them all without reappointing them, in order to benefit from their experience.</p>
<p>No One Bids for the City's Sutra and Repentance Donation The Ningbo City's sutra and repentance donation was originally scheduled to be bid on the 15th of this month at the Finance Bureau of the Municipal Government. It is heard that as of yesterday, there were still no bidders. This is probably due to the impact of the central government's order to abolish the sutra and repentance donation in various provinces, cities, and counties. According to the various sections of the Finance Bureau, this sutra and repentance donation is included in the municipal education fund. If it is abolished now, the education fund will be short again, and it must be remedied in another way.</p>
<p>The Yuyao Chief Prosecutor's Malfeasance Case Will Be Tried Separately The case of Yang Hongjun, the chief prosecutor of the Yuyao County Court, being accused of malfeasance has been transferred by the High Court to the Yin County Local Court for trial. The court has repeatedly opened hearings and summoned witnesses. There is a co-defendant in the case, Wang Zaichen, the deputy director of the Yuyao China Bank. After the previous trial, he was temporarily released on bail with a guarantee from Wang Yingzhou, who was acting on behalf of Lu. Unexpectedly, Wang Zaichen returned to Yao for medical treatment due to illness. He failed to appear at the previous summons. The prosecutor was furious and immediately arrested Wang Yingzhou and Lu and ordered them to hand over Wang Zaichen. It is now found that Wang Zaichen came to Yong yesterday afternoon to surrender. After being questioned by the prosecutor, he was released on bail for 1,000 yuan in cash at the request of a certain cigarette shop. The guarantors Wang Yingzhou and Lu, who had been arrested, were also released immediately. Yang Hongjun had previously changed his guarantor to a certain cigarette paper shop because the original guarantor had withdrawn.</p>
<p>Another Bandit Robbery in the Southern Countryside of Yuyao About twenty miles from Yuyao County City, there is a resident named Lv Chunyang in Tongde Township's Liushuitan Village, who earns his living by farming and manages his family diligently, so he has accumulated some savings over the years. This has aroused the covetousness of some bandits. Unexpectedly, in the third watch of the night before last, more than ten robbers suddenly came, wearing blue cloth short shirts and holding shell guns and other weapons, breaking down the door and entering the room, forbidding any outcry. Fortunately, the old and young in Yangchun's family knew there was something wrong when they heard the door knocking, and escaped through the back door, avoiding harm. However, all the belongings and the cash in the house were looted. Afterwards, the bandits all fled south. The estimated losses are over 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Time Limit for Demolition and Concession of Streets: Magistrate Tang, in order to facilitate transportation, previously ordered the demolition and concession of streets from Dajiang Bridge to Qingdao Bridge to facilitate road construction. Due to requests from the business community for an extension, meetings were held to discuss the matter, and it was submitted to the Provincial Department of Construction for approval. Instructions have now been received, stipulating the method of demolition and concession: Dajiang Bridge to Qingdao Bridge is divided into two sections, Beihai Slope to Shuicheng Bridge into two sections, and Qingdao Bridge to Wuyunmen into three sections. Each section has a time limit of three months for completion of the demolition and concession.</p>
<p>Handling the Distribution of Low-Priced Rice: The county government has issued a notice to organize committees in all rural areas of the county to implement the plan for selling rice at low prices. Yesterday, the Food Maintenance Association distributed the rice according to the plan. In addition to allocating 3,000 bags of unpolished rice to the disaster areas of Tianle, Dezheng, and Xialu Townships, the allocations were: 1,691 bags for District 1, 1,000 bags for District 2, 670 bags for District 3, 400 bags for District 4, 740 bags for District 5, 860 bags for District 6, 440 bags for District 7, 1,500 bags for District 8, 1,700 bags for District 9, and 950 bags for District 10. The price of polished rice is set at 14 yuan per stone, and unpolished rice at 12 yuan per stone. Based on the county's population of 1,123,274, each person will receive approximately nine 合 of rice per day. The sale will be completed within 20 days from the start date.</p>
<p>False Alarm at the Prison: At 4:00 PM on the 17th, there was a rumor of a riot by prisoners at the Shaoxing Prison. Military police from various locations rushed to provide security. However, upon arrival, no such activity was found. Because Warden Yang was out, cunning prisoners fabricated the rumor in hopes of being released.</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Tenant Farmers Gather at the County to Petition: At approximately 2:00 PM on the 12th, over one thousand farmers from Nanhutian Village in the Fourth Northern Township sent representatives Chen Zhaohua, Gu Junhui, Yu Guosheng, and Lian Guangjie to the County Government, County Party Headquarters, and Agricultural Consolidation Committee to petition. The purpose of their request was generally as follows: The rice they planted is now mature and ready for harvest. Last year, the estimation of the total harvest was delayed, resulting in an extremely lean year. The estimated yield was more than four stone per mu. However, the landlords were even more greedy, with some seeking to pursue legal action against the farmers. The people have already suffered from the disaster, and now they are burdened by lawsuits. Now that the rice is about to ripen, they fear repeating last year's situation. They propose suspending the harvesting of all rice in Nanhutian, requesting a quick estimation of the yield, and asking for the clear definition of a "public dou" measure to avoid disputes. After the main personnel of each agency met with them, the main points of their response can be divided into three points: (1) The harvest yield can be estimated jointly by the local township office or the district party branch in accordance with the regulations. (2) The amount of rent needs to be requested from the provincial authorities for further instructions. (3) The "public dou" measure will continue to be issued by the province as the standard and promulgated. The representatives were satisfied and gradually dispersed.</p>

<h3>Domestic Public Debt Maintenance Association Cables to Maintain Public Debt</h3>
<p>(1) Cable to the National Government: To the National Government in Nanjing, we note with concern the recent sharp decline in public debt, creating a dangerous situation, undermining national credit, and leading to economic bankruptcy. Please immediately cable the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to ensure that bonds used as collateral or for discount that are repaying principal and interest on schedule are treated equally without exception, and that excuses not be used to reject such bonds so as to undermine bond credibility. Also instruct the Ministry of Finance to order the Director General of Customs to announce the precise amount of revenue and expenditure from the funds each ten days to clarify the truth and dispel rumors. Furthermore, inform the Shanghai Securities Exchange that all those selling futures must first deposit the goods as collateral, without needing to deposit a separate security deposit, and that those who do not first deposit the goods should not be allowed to sell short, thereby preventing the abuses of speculation, manipulation, and the fabrication of rumors to depress prices. This is a fundamental relief measure. We respectfully request that this be promptly submitted to the State Council for discussion and maintenance, so as to ensure bond credibility and maintain the economy. The Shanghai Domestic Public Debt Maintenance Association.</p>
<p>(2) Cable to the Ministry of Finance: To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, the price of public debt has been declining gradually and sharply in recent months, and the customs bonds have declined to little over 3000 yuan per 10,000, and the military reorganization bonds have declined to a little over 3000 yuan per 10,000, and other bonds have also declined in value. The national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the foundation of the banks is dangerously shaky. If remedies are not sought urgently, the dangerous situation may give rise to irretrievable outcomes. Viewing the crisis, we could not stand by idly and do nothing, so we are sending you a cable respectfully requesting that your department instruct the Director General of Customs and the Committee for the Management of the Customs 25 Treasury Bond Fund to publish the revenue and expenditure of the public debt fund in newspapers every ten days in a clear announcement, and that you allow representatives to be sent from the Silver Trade Association and the Market Traders' Association to go and conduct an inspection and confirm, so that the people of the country may know that your department has not been using the public debt fund, thereby dispelling doubts and stopping rumors. Furthermore, we request that you order the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications to treat bonds used as collateral and for discount that are repaying principal and interest on a monthly basis that are not behind schedule equally and without exception, and not to make excuses or reject them, so as to avoid damaging bond credibility. Banks that have been specially permitted by the government to issue banknotes must also handle it the same way, and those who resist or refuse should be regarded as undermining bond credibility and be subject to legal sanctions. Furthermore, the Shanghai Securities Exchange should be ordered to notify all brokers that all those selling futures must first deposit the goods as collateral, and that the usual security deposit does not need to be paid again, and that all those who do not have the goods at hand who intend to speculate by selling short should be rejected, and that your department should send a staff member to be stationed specially in the Securities Exchange to inspect the depositing of the goods so as to verify the conclusion of transactions, so that generally those who fabricate rumors of unsuccessful military operations to lower the market price and profit by selling short will have no place to implement their tricks. This is a fundamental relief measure, and we ask you to make a prompt and decisive decision and be responsible for its implementation, so as to maintain bond credibility and maintain the economy.

<h3>County Consolidation Committee Orders Solicitation of Comfort Money for Wounded Soldiers and Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Deadline: August 15th</p>
<p>To Be Managed Jointly by Various Agencies</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Consolidation Committee issued an order to each district yesterday: "For the purpose of notification, the Provincial Consolidation Committee's Order No. 2310 states: The Central Executive Committee's Order states: It is found that Yan and Feng colluded evilly to plan rebellion. The Central Government, in order to remove revolutionary obstacles, launched a large-scale crusade. Since the dispatch of troops, it has successively conquered famous cities and cleared away the rebellious atmosphere. The end can be expected daily. However, our soldiers at the front are loyal, brave, and determined, disregarding their own safety. Injuries and disabilities are inevitable under the hail of bullets. The people in the war zone have either been trampled by the rebel army or affected by the flames of war. Their houses have been destroyed, and they are displaced and destitute. This is deeply concerning. It is necessary to find ways to provide relief to the wounded soldiers at the front and the disaster-stricken people in the war zone. The 95th Standing Committee of this Association decided: 1. The Central Government will first allocate 200,000 yuan from the relief fund for relief purposes. 2. Party departments and guidance groups will initiate fund-raising at home and abroad. In addition to ordering party departments at all levels to comply, it is specifically ordered that your association immediately comply and forward the order to your subordinates for compliance. The handling situation should still be reported." After submitting this to the 50th Committee Meeting of this Association, it was decided to hand it over to the Provincial Publicity Committee and to order each county party department and each directly affiliated district party department to comply. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is jointly ordered that your department immediately comply and report as required. This order was submitted by this Association to the Fifth Party-Government Talk, and as a result, each agency and each district party department will cooperate with each district office to solicit donations separately, with a deadline of August 15th. In addition to issuing separate letters, it is jointly ordered that your association comply as required. This order.</p>
<h3>Women's Comfort Goods Transported to Beijing</h3>
<p>The loading area at the North Station was very crowded last night because there were many items urgently needing to be loaded. Among them, the most noticeable were over 33,000 pairs of straw sandals, over 30,000 cans each of candy and preserved vegetables, over 60,000 towels, 135 boxes of braised bamboo shoots, and 30 boxes of medicinal liquid. After investigation, it was learned that these items were being transported to Beijing by the Capital Women's Comfort Association to reward the Jiang-Cai troops newly arrived from Guangdong. It is found that since its establishment, the association has been quite effective, and two months before, when the Training Corps was about to set off, the association held a variety show to send them off. Up to now, the comfort items sent to the front line include 30,000 sets of white shirts and trousers for wounded soldiers, 170,000 towels, 160,000 bottles of disinfectant liquid, 20,000 cans of braised bamboo shoots, 20,000 bars of scented soap, and many cans of food and candy. The initiators, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Madame Dai Jitao, Madame Hu Zhantang, Madame Gu Yingfen, Madame Ge Jingen, Madame Liu Jiwen, Madame Fang Zhenwu, and Ms. Yi Xiang, were concerned about the hardships of the soldiers at the front and ran around soliciting donations, sparing no effort, which is why they were able to achieve these results.</p>

<h3>"Yuan Da" Steamer Detained by Soviet Russian Fleet</h3>
<p>The local Yi Da Steamship Company owns a steamer called "Yuan Da," which can carry more than 6,300 tons and is the largest ship owned by Chinese people in recent times. In March of this year, it was leased to the Vladivostok Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet for operation, with a monthly rental of $15,000. Unexpectedly, when the ship was sailing back to Vladivostok from Tokyo in early April, it hit a reef due to fog about ten miles from Vladivostok. The Soviet Russian fleet dispatched ships to rescue it, including two icebreakers and one barge. First, the cargo in the ship was unloaded, and then the "Yuan Da" was towed back to Vladivostok. Vladivostok's shipyard, the only one in the city, is state-owned by Soviet Russia. The shipyard refused to repair it but agreed to provide temporary emergency repairs to make it seaworthy for one voyage so that it could be formally repaired in another port. These temporary repairs would cost 11,000 gold rubles, equivalent to about $20,000 in Chinese currency. However, since the accident, the Soviet Russian fleet has telegraphed to declare the termination of the lease and to stop paying rent. According to international practice, anyone who provides assistance when a ship has an accident at sea should receive a salvage fee. This salvage fee should be borne by the shipowner and the cargo owners in proportion to the value of the ship and the cargo. This is the so-called general average. After receiving the news of the "Yuan Da" hitting the reef, the local Yi Da Company sent Nao Cheng, a Chinese shipowner named Pu Li, to Vladivostok to represent the company and handle various matters concerning the ship. After Pu Li arrived in Vladivostok, he repeatedly consulted with the managers of the Soviet Russian fleet, requesting that they announce the total value of the cargo, quickly determine the amount of salvage costs, and assess the value of the "Yuan Da" in order to calculate the salvage costs to be borne by the ship. Although the temporary repairs had been completed, the Soviet Russian fleet delayed fulfilling the above assessment and other matters. Since the lease had been terminated, all losses from the monthly $15,000 rental were borne by the shipowner. After repeated urgings by Yi Da's representative, shipowner Pu Li, they continued to make excuses. Finally, one week after the incident, on May 27th, they sent a letter to the representative requesting the shipowner to deposit 80,000 Japanese yen (equivalent to more than $160,000 in Chinese currency) to release the ship to be repaired in another port. Pu Li replied, asking how this amount was calculated, but after several inquiries, there was no response. The total value of the cargo on board was never disclosed. Pu Li went to the fleet's office and protested verbally, asking how much the ship was valued at. At first, they said 97,000 gold rubles. Later, when Pu Li questioned why the salvage cost was more than 80% of the estimated value, creating an unprecedented example in the world for calculating salvage costs, they deliberately raised the ship's price to 120,000 to 180,000 gold rubles. When asked how much the cargo on board was worth, they said that there were two bills of lading, each worth about $40,000 US dollars, with an approximate total value of 300,000 Japanese yen. However, they were only expressed verbally and were not willing to put them in writing. Pu Li requested to see various supporting documents, but they were all rejected. After many negotiations in Vladivostok without any effect, he returned to Shanghai in anger and reported the details of the negotiations to Yi Da Company. The company consulted various well-known shipping experts in Shanghai on the matter. According to the experts' opinions, icebreakers are government property of Soviet Russia. According to international maritime law, in addition to actual expenses, no salvage remuneration can be requested. The actual expenses required for the rescue must be very limited. Even if it is still paid according to ordinary salvage remuneration, the maximum should not exceed 80,000 Japanese yen. However, this refers to the total salvage cost for the ship and cargo. According to the fleet's initial estimate of the ship's price, the shipowner's share should be at most one-quarter of the total salvage cost. The demand for 80,000 Japanese yen to release the ship is not known on what basis. Now the shipowner Yi Da Company has entrusted the local lawyer Cai Rudong to handle the matter on its behalf. The reporter of the Guowen News Agency visited lawyer Cai the day before yesterday. According to Cai, in order to attempt a reconciliation, he has telegraphed the Vladivostok Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet that the shipowner here is willing to deposit 25,000 Japanese yen in the bank to urge them to release the ship immediately. Otherwise, our responsibility has been exhausted, and we have been particularly generous in calculating the salvage costs, making excessive concessions. If the Soviet Russian fleet persists in its error, the shipowner will have appropriate countermeasures. Under the red imperialism, even if the shipowner cannot obtain fair treatment, the "Yuan Da" ship lease contract stipulates that the place for delivery and return of the ship, payment of rent, and adjudication of disputes is Shanghai. Since the place for fulfilling the contractual obligations has been clearly specified in Shanghai, the Chinese court has jurisdiction over the case according to law. When service is made in the future, it can be executed in accordance with the Civil Procedure Regulations, and any property of the fleet in China can be seized to compensate the shipowner's losses. According to lawyer's opinion, the fleet's request for 80,000 Japanese yen to release the ship is ridiculous. In addition to 80,000 Japanese yen, the shipowner must also pay 11,000 gold rubles for temporary repairs. In the future, formal repairs will require another 40,000 to 50,000 taels of silver. If so, the ship will cost a total of 240,000 to 250,000 Chinese dollars. The ship is not actually worth this amount, and the suspension of navigation for four months at a loss of 15,000 yuan per month totals 60,000 yuan, not to mention other expenses. The fleet's behavior is intended to confiscate the ship by taking the opportunity. How can the shipowner willingly submit and tolerate such a large loss? Therefore, he has decided to do everything possible to deal with it. As for the shipowner's inherent rights, he will never give up even a thread of loss. It is learned that many ships operating under the Soviet Russian fleet are leased from Chinese ship merchants. After the "Yuan Da" accident, the fleet has adopted such a strong and unreasonable attitude. In the future, Chinese shipping merchants who lease ships to the fleet should also be aware of the precautions. Even more, the ship lease contract stipulates that British law applies. In the long history of Britain, the salvage fee obtained by rescuers has never exceeded 50% of the value of the rescued object, and this ratio can only be obtained if the ship has already been abandoned. Now, the "Yuan Da" is only aground on the bow, and the fleet dispatched ships to provide some assistance and towed it to Vladivostok, but it is taking the opportunity to extort money and attempt to confiscate the shipowner's ship. Not only have the local shipping experts never heard of it, but it is indeed a matter that should be noted by countries around the world.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Exempt from Parcel Tax</h3>
<p>The local Parcel Tax Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating that native cloth is related to the prosperity or decline of domestic goods. Moreover, at a time when the National Government is promoting domestic goods, the parcel tax on native cloth should be exempted across the board to relieve commercial difficulties and conform to the original intention of promotion.</p>
<h3>Changbang Rice Merchants Did Not Collect Special Donations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Changshu Rice Merchants Association previously had a rumor of major activities to collect special donations from various shipowners in the group. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau detained Jin Kai, an employee of the association, and sent him to the Public Security Bureau for custody and interrogation. It was previously reported that Jin Kai confessed that the collection of special donations was decided by the executive and supervisory meetings of the association and had nothing to do with him. Jin Kai was allowed to be released on bail, and the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Changshu Rice Merchants Association to clearly respond to the reasons for collecting special donations. According to the reply, the collection of special donations was purely proposed by a few shipowners. The executive committee decided to retain the matter in the minutes of the meeting because it involved increasing the burden on members, which can be used as evidence. Unexpectedly, Jin Kai spread rumors outside that the executive committee had decided to collect donations, thinking of profiting from it. Lu Junwen found out the truth and immediately notified the shipowners, which did not become a reality. After inquiring with the shipowners in Shanghai, they said that they had not paid special donations. The rumors are purely fabricated. Please exempt Lu Junwen from investigation, etc. Since the Social Affairs Bureau confirmed that special donations were not actually collected, the situation is still forgivable. However, Lu Junwen repeatedly resisted summons and did not arrive, which is really inappropriate. Since he has not participated in this matter, he should still go to the bureau for inquiries. The association is responsible for dredging the source and supervising the rice merchants to strictly abide by government orders and provide a guarantee to the bureau to avoid further investigation.</p>
<h3>Graduates of the Telecommunications School Assigned to Various Bureaus</h3>
<p>The graduation examination for the intermediate wired class and the supplementary class of the Telecommunications School of the Ministry of Communications was held simultaneously from June 20th.

After the examination was completed on the 27th, the school immediately submitted the grades of the students to the ministry for review and requested to be assigned to work in various bureaus according to their merits. It is now learned that the grades of the students have been rigorously reviewed by the ministry. As a result, except for the supplementary student Yuan Weiliang, who was deemed to be of poor quality and was immediately dismissed, and Deng Zhuxiang and ten others, who did not perform well and were awaiting orders from the ministry to determine their stay, the rest all passed and were approved to be assigned to work in various bureaus.

<h3>Evaluation Method Agreed Upon for Registration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Milling Industry Association held an executive committee meeting the day before yesterday. More than a dozen members attended, including Lu Guishan, Pan Xianting, Zhu Zixiang, and Liu Wenhao. Chairman Zhu Zixiang reported briefly that, according to Instruction No. 2535 from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the white rice of the North City factories and warehouses must be registered and evaluated in accordance with the white rice of the He Xia, and must not be sold without authorization. After discussion, all agreed that the industry currently has very little inventory, only enough for retail sales at the door. If there is indeed surplus inventory and they want to sell it, they should strictly abide by the instruction, register directly with the Rice Merchants Association, and openly evaluate it. However, they must follow the pure method of the South City and sell it through the Rice Merchants. As for the warehouse goods, it is not within the scope of the association, so it is not convenient to plan on their behalf. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

The picture shows Mr. Mei talking to welcomers after disembarking (Photo by M)</p>
<p>The welcome was extremely enthusiastic. Representatives from all walks of life went to the wharf to welcome them. The scene was bustling with activity. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The grand welcome: Around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the welcomers at the wharf on the Bund arrived one after another. There were more than a hundred people, including Li Shizeng, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and people from all walks of life. Representatives from the Golden Theatre, Rongji Stage, and the Performing Arts United Association held welcome flags. The Yangzhou Eight County Association hired a military band, using a small boat to shuttle back and forth on the Huangpu River, playing music to welcome them. Star Film Company also sent personnel to the wharf to take movies.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei lands: Around 5:00 PM, the Chichibu Maru arrived at the wharf. Mei Lanfang and Qi Rushan held national flags, leaned on the railing, and waved their handkerchiefs to thank the people on the shore. Welcomers then boarded the ship to meet and talk.

On the one hand, they are preparing for their trip to Europe. According to Mr. Mei yesterday, this trip yielded few results, and he is very ashamed to receive such a warm welcome from everyone. This time in the United States, he observed various industries and gained a lot of knowledge. Regarding drama, he has gained something and is willing to offer what he has learned from that country to the Chinese drama circle as a reference for mutual improvement.</p>

The picture below shows the situation of the welcomers looking at Mr. Mei (Photo by M)</p>
<h3>The Long-Silent Case of the Grand Light</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Open in Court This Month on the 24th in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The Grand Light Cinema showed the sound film "Not Afraid of Death" in March of this year. Hong Shen, a teacher at Fudan University, went to see it and found that the content of the film was too insulting to Chinese people. He immediately gave a speech. The audience was moved by Hong, and most of them left. The manager of the cinema, Gao Yongqing, called the police and arrested Hong and detained him in the New Gate Police Station. After negotiations, he was released. Hong submitted a report to the Municipal Party Department and forwarded it to the Central Government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the US government, and filed a complaint against Gao in the former Provisional Court. The trial was opened once, but it was postponed due to the hope of a settlement. Counting the fingers, it has been almost four months, and the news of the settlement has been extremely silent, and it is expected to be hopeless. Last month, the plaintiff, Hong Shen, believed that the case had been delayed for too long, which was not right, so he hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to request the Special District District Court to schedule a trial as soon as possible. It is now learned that the court has scheduled the case to be heard this month on the 24th at 2:00 PM. Yesterday, the police officers sent notices to the plaintiff's lawyers, Zhan Jifeng and Wu Chengyu, and the defendant's lawyers, Jiang Baoli, to inform the parties concerned that they must appear in court on time and await trial.</p>
<h3>The Hurricane Did Not Reach Shanghai</h3>
<p>It Has Reached the Waters off Nagasaki, Japan</p>
<p>The second hurricane discovered over the Pacific Ocean has now entered the inland sea. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, according to a report from the Yangjingbang Observatory, it has blown to 131 degrees east longitude and 33 degrees north latitude, in the waters off Nagasaki, Japan, and is spreading widely. The wind is trending northeast and north, and it seems that it will land. From this point of view, the saying that Shanghai will have a second hurricane may no longer become a reality.</p>
<h3>A Mad Woman Who Killed Two People Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Not Responsible for Anything When Insane</p>
<p>Should Regain Freedom Once the Madness Has Healed</p>
<p>Jiang Xu, a woman from Wuxi, suffered from mental illness. After being treated in the New Universal Charity Asylum for the Insane, she was discharged after she recovered. Later, she suffered from other diseases and was sent to the Sanatorium Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, her madness relapsed and she took a kitchen knife and killed two women who were being treated in the same hospital. She was immediately sent back to the Asylum for the Insane for treatment and has since recovered. After examining the deceased, the prosecutor of the local court filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. After the debate was opened, she claimed that at that time she only felt blurred vision. In her eyes, she saw two black fish and had been drooling with anticipation for eggplant for a long time. So she took a kitchen knife in the hospital to kill the fish, but they were people. It was the ghost's fault, not mine. The judge announced the end of the trial. Yesterday, Judge Zhao ordered Jiang Xu to be brought to the court to announce the verdict: Jiang Xu was found not guilty and should be allowed to be free. The reason for the verdict was that the woman was originally insane and mentally lost. This was due to the hospital's negligence in preventing it. After her illness was diagnosed, she should have known that her freedom should not have been restricted. Moreover, the hospital setting up kitchen knives was also negligent. Therefore, the fault was not with the defendant, and she should not be held criminally liable. She was therefore advised to be not guilty. As for the defendant who has now been cured, she must no longer be bound by her freedom and should be allowed to be free. After the verdict, the woman was returned to the prosecutor's office and sent to the New Universal Charity Asylum for collection.</p>
<h3>Casia Requests the Return of Confiscated Property</h3>
<p>Requests All Items Except Gambling Equipment to be Returned</p>
<p>Casia, the principal offender in the roulette gambling den case at 151 Jingan Temple Road, has now been released after serving his sentence and is presenting a petition to the Special District District Court to request the return of all confiscated property except gambling equipment. This petition was originally intended to be delivered to the court yesterday, but it was changed to today because there were still corrections to be made. It is heard that this past Tuesday, Casia was allowed by the court to go to the archives with a lawyer to review the files of the case and investigate the confiscated items.</p>
<h3>Discovery in Pudong</h3>
<p>Superstition Tax Collection Agency</p>
<p>One Agency Splitting into Two</p>
<p>Pudong Even Manages Nanshi</p>
<p>Seized False Letters of Appointment, etc.</p>
<p>Zhang Youshi May Have Been Deceived</p>
<p>Yesterday, detectives from the Third District of the Public Security Bureau discovered a cunning agency claiming to collect superstition taxes on Huayuan Shiqiao Main Street, Pudong. Various false documents were seized. The details are recorded as follows: The agency is small but very busy. In February of this year, a long strip of white paper suddenly appeared at the entrance of a building at No. 151 Huayuan Shiqiao Main Street, north of Lan Ni Du, Pudong, reading "Shanghai Special Municipality Finance Bureau Pudong Superstition Tax Collection Branch Preparatory Office." Many people, both men and women, entered and exited every day. Passersby often stopped to watch. The interior was quite neatly arranged, resembling a small-scale agency. The staff inside seemed to be very busy. Recently, a piece of paper with the words "Nanshi Collection Office" was added to the entrance, splitting one agency into two. Those who didn't know suspected it was a development of their work. Unexpectedly, the fate of the agency ended at this time. The Finance Bureau was always unaware. District Chief Zhang of the Third District reported to the General Bureau for investigation because the agency was very eye-catching. Director Yuan was also suspicious because he had not received a formal notice from the Finance Bureau. He immediately inquired with the Finance Bureau, which also denied appointing anyone to set up an agency in Pudong to collect superstition taxes. Therefore, he instructed Shen Tong, the Shanghai South Director of the bureau, to send two investigators, Cheng Yushu and Cheng Qiwen, to Pudong to investigate at 4 p.m. yesterday. The district chief then ordered detectives Zhang Chunting, et al., to cooperate with the police to search the agency. On the spot, they seized a seal of the "Shanghai Finance Bureau Nanshi Pudong Superstition Scripture Donation Collection Branch," a letter of appointment for the director of the collection office, Zhong Yuanzhi, eleven blank appointment envelopes, which were found to be forged, and a collection book, a cash flow book, and a rent book. At that time, the director of the office, Zhong Yuan, was still out entertaining and did not recognize it as a cunning agency. The detectives took the witnesses, along with eleven collectors and Zhong's wife, Lin, to the Third District for processing. It was found that the main agency was located in Zhabei. District Chief Zhang immediately brought the case for preliminary interrogation. Zhong confessed that he was 36 years old, from Ningbo, and formerly served as the branch chief of the Lishui County Public Security Bureau. In February of this year, he was appointed by Zhang Youshi, the director of the Shanghai Finance Bureau Superstition Scripture Donation Collection Office, as the director of the Pudong Collection Branch, and obtained a letter of appointment. He then rented a house in Pudong to prepare for opening the branch. Recently, he was additionally appointed to handle Nanshi. He has been preparing for five months. Zhang has taken away 1,500 yuan in security deposits. All expenses during the preparation period totaled more than 1,000 yuan. The main agency is located at No. 144 Huzhou Road, Zhabei. Currently, the branch has recruited five or six people who donate 50 yuan each, all of whom have been registered. The collectors Yao Ningxing, Huang Jiachang, Chen Jinlian, Li Guowu, Chen Jichu, Lu Hai, Chen Jingru, Wang Rongqiang, Wang Zhibing, Zhu Daohui, and Luo Youcai successively confessed the same information. The district chief believes that these people may have been deceived and that the main agency is still in Zhabei, so he reported to the director by phone for investigation and arrest. Meanwhile, he sent all the witnesses to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Continued Interrogation of Wu Jiangguang, et al., Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Debate Concluded</p>
<p>Order to Announce the Judgment on a Set Date</p>
<p>The well-known blind man Wu Jiangguang, et al., were sued by Kuomintang member Yu Qingyu in the Special District Local Court for the crime of using妖言惑衆 to defraud money. It has been interrogated twice and has been reported in the newspapers. It was interrogated again yesterday. Yu's wife, Chen, did not arrive. According to Yu, the various妖言惑衆 actions of the defendants not only harmed him personally, but also violated the Three Principles of the People, which is not allowed under the party's rule. Therefore, the personal loss is still light, but the responsibility for破坏主义 is difficult to forgive. Judge Feng Shide then asked whether the plaintiff's accusation that the defendants committed fraud was because the defendants improperly used exorcism and sold符咒. Yu said yes. Judge Feng instructed him, according to the confessions of the defendants Chai Caigao, et al., that the scriptures were not sold by them. Can you prove it? Yu said, then who sold the scriptures obtained by my wife? Chai should be ordered to confess clearly. Yu continued, during the previous court hearing, the defendant's lawyer, Ye Fukan, brought a fake Wu Jiangguang to court to pretend to be the real Wu Jiangguang and asked my wife to identify him. Although my wife mistakenly identified the fake as the real one at that time, this was not my wife's mistake. When my wife went to Wu's place, Wu was upstairs, and his disciple did a reading for her. My wife mistakenly thought this disciple was Wu himself. The fake Wu Jiangguang who came to court the other day was the disciple who did the reading in the past, so she still mistakenly identified him. When questioned about the various accusations made by Yu, Wu and the other five defendants consistently denied them. Then, after mutual arguments by the lawyers of both parties, Zhang Chongding and Ye Fukan, the court instructed both parties to withdraw and wait for the judgment to be announced on a set date.</p>
<h3>The Jardine Matheson Ship that Had an Accident in Nanyang Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shipowner Describes the Cause of the Accident</p>
<p>There Is a Novelist on Board</p>
<p>Traveling the World with His Wife</p>
<p>Obtaining Good Material at Sea</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the refrigerated cargo ship De Li Cheng, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning after an accident in Nanyang and docked at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. According to the shipowner, on the fifth of this month, the ship was sailing between Singapore and Hong Kong when it suddenly saw thick smoke rising from the ventilator of the third cargo hold in the early morning. He immediately ordered an inspection and found that the coal loaded in the hold was on fire. At that time, the hold contained more than 1,000 tons of English coal, which was shipped from England to the East, so the situation was extremely serious. He immediately gathered the crew and poured water into the hold from above, but it was ineffective for a long time. Therefore, a hole was drilled in the coal in the lower deck, leading to the fire, and a</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>belt was inserted to pour water, which gradually extinguished the fire. During this time, the crew rescued day and night, very bravely. As for the cause of the accident, it was probably due to prolonged exposure to the hot sea, which caused a chemical reaction and spontaneous combustion, which could not be prevented by human power. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong and the coal was unloaded, it was found that a considerable amount had been burned to ashes and coke, which shows the intensity of the fire. The famous Australian novelist Colin and his wife were on board, traveling the world to collect materials, and also came to Shanghai. According to the shipowner, because Mr. and Mrs. Colin were greatly frightened, the fare was not collected. Colin was very fortunate to have obtained a good material for maritime life and hopes that there will be good works in the future to offer to the world.</p>
<h3>The Disturbance During the Construction of Buildings at Jinan University</h3>
<p>Misunderstanding Among Local Workers</p>
<p>Accountant Severely Injured by Chopping</p>
<p>Accident on the Way to the Hospital</p>
<p>Car Runs Over Pedestrian's Finger</p>
<p>A dormitory is being built at Zhenru Jinan University, which is contracted by Jiang Hengji Construction Factory. The factory employs Zhang Peixing, a 28-year-old accountant from Nanxiang. He is young, capable, and resourceful. He is usually deeply trusted by the factory owner, so he is entrusted with all matters, large and small. At that time, a large number of carpenters were hired, mostly from Nanxiang. Later, because the school authorities needed the buildings when the next semester started, they had to add dozens of workers locally to speed up the completion. They worked in peace for more than ten days. A few days ago, the local carpenters reported to the accountant Zhang Peixing that the quality of the wood was uneven and unsuitable for work, and they wanted to add better wood. Zhang replied that the building was about to be completed. Could they use it temporarily? If it was absolutely unusable, please suspend work temporarily, and after reporting to the factory owner, wait for the good materials to be transported before starting work again. When the workers heard this, they misunderstood that he was arrogant and deliberately making things difficult for the local people. In the afternoon, they gathered all the local carpenters and held a meeting in a nearby teahouse. As a result, they believed that it was an insult to the local workers and decided to strike. At more than 7 p.m. that night, a group of workers gathered at the accountant's office to reason with Zhang Peixing. They destroyed the accountant's office when a word was said amiss. Fortunately, Peixing was rescued by others to avoid the disaster. Wait for the factory owner to come and solve the problem again. Unexpectedly, at about 12 noon yesterday, the Nanxiang workers and Zhang Peixing were having lunch when dozens of local people arrived with weapons such as axes and iron bars. Without asking the reason, they suddenly took action. The Nanxiang workers fled because they had no weapons. Peixing was chopped on his two arms, shoulder bones, and left foot with an axe, and a Nanxiang worker, Qiang Liansheng, was chopped on his arm with an axe, about three or four inches deep. Blood flowed non-stop, and the injury was serious. The murderers then dispersed. They immediately called the Linji car company near Si Malu Qinghefang and ordered the driver to drive car No. 17577 to the destination, carrying the two injured people in the car to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the old garbage bridge, because the speed was too high, the rickshaw driver Xia Er (50 years old) from Jiangbei was knocked to the ground and his fingers were crushed. He was arrested by post No. 2205 and transported to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Youth Unemployed and Jumping into the Huangpu River Saved by Quick-Eyed Sailor</h3>
<p>The first shift small steamship Kuai Da Hao of Taikoo Company was loading passengers at Huatong Wharf in Lanni Du, Pudong at 3:30 pm yesterday, and was sailing to Yangjingbang Wharf in the French Concession. When it reached the center of the Huangpu River, near a Japanese warship, a young man in a white T-shirt and blue striped府綢 trousers suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the sailor had quick eyes and stopped the engine to rescue him. Then, Hua Bu No. 32 of the Water Patrol Station arrived and took him to the police station to ask why he committed suicide. Unexpectedly, the man cried and said nothing. After repeated questioning, he confessed his name as Xu Jiaming, 24 years old, from Huzhou, living in Sanglin, his original place of residence. He used to work in a silk factory. Recently, he lost his job, so he came to Shanghai to find a friend to seek a job. Because his fate was not good, he had not achieved his wish for many days in a row. The money in his pocket was limited and completely used up. He had to pawn his clothes for cash, which was also completely used up. He currently has no food or lodging and has no face to return to his hometown to see people, so he came up with this idea. His best friend in Shanghai, Zhu Shaohe, is now serving at the Huiwentang Bookstore on Er Ma Lu. The police chief checked the confession and learned that the Huzhou Township Association has been suspended. He ordered the detective to call Zhu to the police station and ask him to take him back for relief and send him back to his hometown.</p>
<h3>Daxi Road Branch Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Director Yan of the Public Security Bureau Supervised the Oath-Taking on the Spot</p>
<p>Xu Yan, the chief of the Second Branch of the Sixth District of the Public Security Bureau in Xujiahui Town, Shanghai,</p>
<p>believed that there were many roads built across the border, and defense was especially important, and that Daxi Road was the most important. For example, at about 9 a.m. on August 26 last fall, Xu Yujie, a staff member of the Customs Statistics Section, was kidnapped at the intersection of Daxi Road and Dunxin Road. In the winter, at about 5 p.m. on November 24, Xi Yuanren and Xi Yuande, two brothers, also students of Guanghua University, were kidnapped at the railway crossing of Daxi Road. At 10 a.m. on April 7 this spring, Pan Shiju, the son of Pan Mingxun, a compradore of the British Engineering Bureau Bank, was driving a car and crashed into Liu Siqiao, injuring and killing him, in front of No. 14 on the road (concession house number). Also, at about 8 a.m. on April 17, Zhang Xinglian, a professor at Guanghua University, and Zhang Hualian, a student, were kidnapped in front of the New China Motor Company on the road. Recently, the Aido Motor Company's car was robbed by bandits at the intersection of Daxi Road and Zhongshan Road, and the manager Li Senfu was kidnapped, so that car robbery and kidnapping were often heard. The encroachment of imperialist police power is increasing day by day. In view of this, Director Xu specially requested Director Yuan to add a branch office on Daxi Road and planned carefully for two months. Later, Mr. Xu Yujie specially built three bungalows, located at the intersection of Daxi Road and Columbia Road, and allocated them to the branch for use. All arrangements are now in order. Wang Zhentang, a first-class patrolman of the Second Branch of the Sixth District, was promoted to the position of patrol officer, and patrol officer Zhang Xiangrui was sent to lead ten patrolmen to garrison. However, the location is crucial, and it is also the center of the road built across the border. It is a pity that the water and electricity cannot be installed for a while before the negotiation is resolved. At 9 a.m. yesterday morning, the establishment ceremony was held at the Daxi Road branch. Director Yuan specially sent Yan Hongxi, the director of the Personnel Section of the First Section, to the site to supervise the oath-taking. Ren Liping, the district chief of the Sixth District, Zhu Tianqi, the captain of the Second Police Squadron, Yang Hongjun, the municipal commissioner of the Fahua District, Zhou Chengxiang, the representative of the Xujiahui business community, and guests Xu Jiyu, Wang Rujue, Jiang Junlian, etc., arrived on time to attend the meeting. Director Xu Yan presided over the meeting, and the ceremony was performed as scheduled. After Director Yan delivered a training speech, the chairman reported on the establishment of the branch and the responsibilities he would bear in the future (the speech is omitted). Finally, guests Yang Hongjun, et al., gave speeches in succession, and the meeting was dismissed with refreshments.</p>
<h3>New Organization in China's Radio Industry</h3>
<p>Named China United Radio Company</p>
<p>Domestic manufacturers of radio equipment include the Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Plant of the Construction Committee, the Zhonghua Sanji Rui Electric Company, the Dahua Scientific Instrument Company, and the Hongkang Electric Material Store. It is found that almost all radio equipment erected in Shanghai is supervised and manufactured by the above four manufacturers. Recently, in order to develop and promote China's radio business, the four manufacturers have concentrated their strength, expanded their scope, and jointly organized the "China United Radio Company" at No. 3, Museum Road, Shanghai. Ding Zuocheng, Wang Zhenxiang, Zhu Qiqing, Wu Weiyue, Yu Ruxin, Tao Jun, Zhang Tingjin, Yan Renguang, and others carefully planned and divided into a board of directors and an engineering department to respectively assume the company's progress matters. Zhu Qiqing was appointed as the chairman of the first board of directors, and Wu Weiyue was appointed as the chairman of the first engineering department. The above gentlemen are all radio experts and occupy a very important position in the radio industry. Their reputation is well-known and admired by the Chinese people. Now they are jointly organizing a company to preside over everything. From now on, the company can undertake all the latest radio equipment. It is predicted that in the future, the United Company will make a great contribution to the country and society.</p>
<h3>Cholera Prevention Plan in Luhang District</h3>

Therefore, Zhang Qiwen, a municipal commissioner of the district, and Qu Shaoji, a citizen, visited Director Hu of the Health Bureau the day before yesterday (17th) to discuss the establishment of a temporary epidemic prevention hospital. Director Hu said that the municipal treasury was in financial difficulty, and it was difficult to run an epidemic prevention hospital.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Reorganizes Shanghai South Public Bus Stops</h3>
<p>The stops of the first, second, and third routes of the Shanghai South public buses are mostly located close to the tram stops where they run parallel to the tracks of Huashang trams. As a result, when the two types of vehicles arrive at the station at the same time, other vehicles are blocked.

<h3>Yancheng Woman Sues Her Birth Mother and Fiance</h3>

<p>The Purpose Is to Seek the Dissolution of the Marriage Contract</p>
<p>Jiang Hanying, a woman from Yancheng, is 22 years old and lives in the workshop at No. 35 Hefengli, Robertsen Road, Shanghai. She was betrothed to Tao Wenquan as a child, but has not yet married. Tao was imprisoned in the Caohejing Prison this spring because of a case. Jiang Hanying has now hired lawyer Zhou Boang to file a lawsuit with the local court, demanding the dissolution of the marriage contract with the first defendant, Tao Wenquan. She demands to sever family ties with the second defendant, Jiang Wang (i.e., the plaintiff's mother), so as to facilitate her marital autonomy, and because she was betrothed to Tao Wenquan, the son of her aunt Tao Wang, when she was a child, relying only on the words of both parents, without a formal marriage certificate, and without going through the betrothal ceremony, it can be invalid. Because her mother Jiang Wang is accustomed to the old morality and is inconvenient to repent, the first defendant Tao Wenquan is naturally prodigal and does not engage in production, resulting in his personality degrading. This spring, he was accused of enticing Lu Wenxiang's wife, named A Er, and was arrested by Lu Wenxiang and sent to your court, sentenced to imprisonment for one year and six months, and is now imprisoned in Caohejing Prison. He has no choice but to request permission to dissolve the marriage contract. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the eighth court for trial and sent an official to the prison to bring Tao to the court for questioning. After the judge took his seat, he first ordered the plaintiff Jiang Hanying to the case to provide a confession. Age 22.

(Question) When was the marriage decided? (Answer) The marriage was decided when I was only one year old. (Question) Now she wants to dissolve the marriage contract, are you willing? (Answer) Not willing, I was hurt by Jiang Hanying this time I ate a lawsuit. Next, Jiang Wang provided a confession. Age 55. Jiang Hanying is my daughter. (Question) Do you know that she is suing? (Answer) I don't know. (Question) Was it betrothed since childhood? (Answer) Yes, Tao Wenquan is my sister's son, an old relative is matched with a relative, I mean I must marry Tao's family, as for his lawsuit, this is his young ignorance, if there is anything wrong, I forgive him very much. (Question) Is there a letter? (Answer) No. (Question) How much is the betrothal gift? (Answer) No, only fish and meat, etc. After the judge obtained the confession, he turned to the defendant and said, it is still better to dissolve it now.

The judgment was scheduled for the 21st of this month. Tao Wenquan, the defendant, was taken back to prison for confinement by the prison guard.</p>
<h3>Yu Xia Agrees to Divorce with 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yu Qiugan, the owner of the Xintai Fresh Meat Shop at Xingjia Benmu Bridge, Zhabei, is 22 years old and is from Chuansha, Pudong. Because his wife, Yu Xia (i.e., Xia Muying), ran away repeatedly, it was difficult to grow old together. He hired lawyer Yan Dajue to file a lawsuit for divorce in the local court. His words were slightly said that on the 16th day of the first month of the 11th year of the Republic of China, his parents were in charge and hired Xia Xidu's daughter Muying as his wife, but she was naturally bad and it was difficult to harmonize the qin and se. She ran away from her husband and escaped three times. The first time was in July of the twelfth year, and she ran away for about a week. Later, the original matchmaker sent her back. In August of the thirteenth year, she ran away for the second time, taking things with her and disappearing without a trace. It was more than a year before she was found by trying to find her in September of the following year (fourteenth year). There were often conflicts between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. On May 30 of this year's national calendar, she ran away for the third time. At that time, she had requested the Public Security Bureau and various police stations to investigate and arrest her, but she could not find her after repeated searches. She had no choice but to publish a notice on June 1 to break away from the relationship between husband and wife. Although she has been found back, she still thinks of escaping in the gap. In this situation, it is difficult to grow old together. The only thing is to divorce her. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian specially opened the fourth court to conduct a trial. According to the plaintiff Yu Qiuquan's confession of the previous situation, he requested permission to divorce. (Question) What reasons are you basing on? (Answer) She often runs away, regardless of family affairs. (Question) Who is the matchmaker? (Answer) Du Quanyuan, and there is a Yu who died. (Question) Have you always been harmonious? (Answer) She is lazy and unwilling to work. She ran away three times in total. After publishing the notice to break away this time, her family sent her back a week later. Next, the defendant Xia Muying provided a confession, age 23. (Question) Where did you go? (Answer) At my mother's house. (Question) Have you been anywhere else? (Answer) No. (Question) How long did you live in your mother's house this time? (Answer) Half a month, because he beat me, so I ran back to my mother's house. (Question) Your husband now wants a divorce, what do you think? (Answer) I don't have any intentions, he doesn't want me, there is no way. (Question) How is it going? (Answer) His heart is unwilling, and my heart is also unwilling. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer said that the defendant had said outside that she was willing to divorce. The questioning official asked the defendant again and again, and her attitude finally stated that divorce was possible, but she needed 500 yuan for living expenses. When asked about the plaintiff, he only allowed to pay 10-20 yuan. The intermediary official repeatedly advised both parties. As a result, the plaintiff paid the defendant 100 yuan, and both parties expressed their willingness. Therefore, a settlement was reached and they divorced each other. The questioning official wrote out the settlement record and ordered both parties to sign and leave the court.</p>
<h3>Former Honorary Leader of the Sports Advancement Association</h3>
<p>Shen Siliang Returned to China Yesterday</p>
<p>A Large Crowd Welcomed Him at the Dock</p>
<p>He Described the State of American Sports</p>
<p>Hoping Our Country Will Promote It Universally</p>
<p>In Addition to Serving as Vice President of Shanghai University</p>
<p>He Will Still Strive to Promote Sports</p>
<p>Investigating Educational Administration: Mr. Shen Siliang, Acting Vice President of Shanghai University and former honorary leader of the All-China Sports Advancement Association, traveled to the United States with his wife and children last July. In addition to investigating educational administration and sports, he attended Columbia University to study education under Dr. Dewey and obtained a Master of Education degree this summer. Mr. Shen formerly specialized in sports at Springfield College in the United States. This time, revisiting old haunts, many friends came to meet him, and he did not feel lonely in a foreign land.</p>
<p>Refereeing Ball Games in the U.S.: While in the United States, he was highly regarded by the country's sports circles. He was invited to serve as a referee for major soccer games three times and a basketball game once. It is rare for a Chinese person to serve as a referee in the United States.</p>
<p>Relatives and Friends Welcomed Him at the Dock: Mr. Shen returned to China yesterday with his wife and children on the Chichibu Maru, arriving at the Wharf at 4 p.m. More than a hundred people from Shanghai's sports circles and his relatives and friends, including Shen Sixin, Hao Boyang, Wu Bangwei, Zhao Xiuhong, Xu Zhendong, Ma Chonggan, Zhang Shilin, Huang Weilian, Sun Daosheng, and Li Baojun, went to the dock to welcome him.</p>
<p>[Image Caption: Mr. Shen Siliang, his wife, and daughter arriving in Shanghai yesterday (photographed by Ye Changlie)]</p>
<p>Talking to the Reporter: After the greetings, Mr. Shen shared with the reporter his observations on the state of sports in the United States. He said that professional competitions are common in the United States, and English football is also very popular. The development of sports in the United States is due to its universal promotion, not just focusing on a few items. People in the U.S. did not pay much attention to the Far Eastern Games, so few people knew about it. Regarding his views on developing sports in China, he believes that one must start from the basics and not just seek temporary radicalism, which would not help in practice. He also hopes that the directors of the Sports Advancement Association will quickly plan for a permanent location for the association and, more importantly, quickly determine a plan for universal promotion, dividing the work and cooperating to advance in all regions. In three to five years, Chinese sports will have a new look, he said. As for Mr. Shen's return to China, he will still serve as the vice president of Shanghai University and will do his best to promote sports. Whether he can serve in the Sports Advancement Association is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Welcomes Him Tonight: Mr. Shen returned to Shanghai University by car at six o'clock in the evening. The faculty and staff will hold a welcome party at the school at 6:30 tonight.</p>

<h3>Handball Invitational Tournament Results</h3>
<p>Zhu Kuan, Sun Daosheng, and Lu Dangbai Win</p>
<p>After the All-Shanghai Handball Championship, organized by the YMCA, concluded last week, the champions and runners-up of Groups A, B, and C, as well as famous players such as Zhu Kuan, initiated an invitational tournament, which was held at the YMCA handball court at 5:30 p.m. yesterday. After the competition, Mr. Hong Eqing, who is enthusiastic about handball, hosted a banquet for the winning players and staff of each group in the YMCA's Western restaurant. The results of yesterday's competition are described below:</p>
<p>Zhu Kuan Engages in Fierce Battle with Hong Yukui: Zhu Kuan is a famous player in the handball world, and his exquisite skills need no further elaboration. Hong Yukui is the champion of Group A, young and strong, and can be called a rising star, but his experience is slightly inferior. In the confrontation between the two, Zhu Kuan showed off his skills and repeatedly made outstanding contributions, once winning by a large margin of 16-0. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Yukui quickly caught up and scored many points in a row. However, the momentum had already become a prairie fire and was difficult to reverse. As a result, Zhu Kuan won the first game 21-9. From the second game onwards, Yukui's momentum suddenly increased, and Zhu Kuan suddenly became weak. As a result, Yukui won 21-8. The strengths of both sides were equal, and a third game should have been played to determine the winner. Later, they agreed to abandon the unplayed game.</p>
<p>Sun Daosheng Defeats Hong Rulin: Sun Daosheng is the runner-up of Group A, and his strength and experience are very sufficient. Hong Rulin is the champion of Group B. The competition between the two sides was quite fierce. Daosheng used both his left and right hands, doing whatever he wanted, making Hong Rulin lose sight of one thing while attending to another and exhausted. As a result, Mr. Sun won two consecutive games 21-9, 21-9.</p>
<p>Lu Aibai Defeats Cheng Zhenhua: Lu is the runner-up of Group B, and Cheng is the champion of Group C. In the confrontation, it was difficult to distinguish the winner. In the first game, Lu won 21-13. From the second game onwards, Cheng seemed to be doing well, and the score exceeded several times, but Lu was unwilling to show weakness and worked hard, and the score jumped to the lead. Cheng followed closely behind, reaching 18-18. Lu continued his efforts and finally won again with 21-18.</p>
<p>The referee for the competition was Gu Yongzhao, and the recorder was Ling Xitao.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Talking About the Capital in the Scorching Heat: Zhang Yan</h3>
<p>Convenient Pavilions for Pedestrians: Zhongshan Road in the capital is a necessary thoroughfare for entering and leaving the city. The traffic is like clouds, and the pedestrians are like weaving. Even Nanjing Road in Shanghai is not as crowded. The current authorities, for the convenience of pedestrians relieving themselves, have specially built four urinals, located in sections along Zhongshan Road. The pavilions are about nine feet high, with flying eaves at the corners, painted in red. They are protected by wooden skirts, shaped like octagons, about three feet shorter than the pavilions, painted in dark green. Viewed from afar, the red and green complement each other, and they are exquisite and unique. People find them convenient, so everyone calls them "Convenient Pavilions."</p>
<p>Many Cold Drink Shops: The capital is hot, even more so than in previous years. In the area of Confucius Temple and Sanshanfu East Street in the south of the city, and Zhongshan Road and Guofu Street in the center of the city, and the area north of the city, many cold drink shops (selling ice cream and soda, etc.) have sprung up. Every few steps, you can see white flags with red characters and soft signboards fluttering in the wind. Some have specially opened elegant rooms, with white cloths covering the tables, flowers in vases, and arranged seats. Others are simple and crude, placing two dining tables in the shop, covered with white cloths, and placing three or four pots of wintergreen grass flowers in front of the door to attract customers and do good business.</p>
<p>Lively Mochou Lake: Mochou Lake is located outside Shuixi Gate in the capital. The lake site covers a large area and has beautiful scenery, making it the best place to escape the summer heat. At the moment, the lotus flowers in the lake are in full bloom. Countless men and women from the city come here to enjoy the cool breeze and admire the lotus flowers. The fragrance of the flowers and the shadows of their hair reflect in the heart of the lake, which is very pleasant. The fragrant lotus roots produced in the lake are the most famous. The lotus roots are crisp and fat, with fine and tender flesh, as white as ice and snow. Although the taste is not as sweet as the lotus roots of West Lake, it is juicy and fragrant, surpassing those of West Lake.</p>
<p>Buses Start Running, Streetcars Stop Running for a Long Time: The long-awaited buses officially started running on the 11th. There are more than 20 passenger cars. The first route runs from Xiaguan to Huangpu Road, divided into ten stations. Each stop costs 12 copper coins. A bus runs every ten minutes. The entire route takes about 40 minutes. As for the rickshaws pulled by coolies, due to the excessive heat, their flesh and blood bodies cannot withstand the scorching sun, so streetcars have been scarce for days. Even if there are any, the prices are raised because of this. Passengers do not even have time to haggle over the price, which shows that there are too few streetcars.</p>
<h3>A Formula for Killing Bedbugs: Tao Zaidong</h3>
<p>A comrade of this publication, seeing the bedbug-killing formula recorded by me, thought it was magical and wonderful. He telephoned me and asked me to announce the formula for imitation. I had said before that I had no right to refuse. Now I will announce this formula, but I must first announce the person who taught me this formula. That person is a stunningly beautiful woman, named Bian Zizhi, whose former self was one of the flower fairies, the Michelia alba fairy. She has both talent and beauty, and her personality is humorous. I met her in my childhood in "Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror," and she told me this formula. The formula is very simple, and I recommend imitating it and adding one or two ingredients. I must say this first because it is a scholar's virtue not to betray the teacher or steal the credit. The formula is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zizhi Fairy Teaches Tao Ling's Wonderful Formula for Killing Bedbugs:</p>
<p>Clean (sufficient weight) - Fingers</p>
<p>(Wash two) - Diligent Catch (one ingredient)</p>
<h3>Words of Wisdom: Qiushui</h3>
<p>The longer young people live in this world, the more they despise society, despise friends, and even despise themselves. Although a man hands the key to his heart to a woman and marries her, he never wants his heart to be opened once and then closed again.</p>
<p>Women's hearts can be said to be the most gentle. But when she hears the news that her old flame is marrying someone else and feels dissatisfied, she cannot control a slight sense of self-satisfaction and pleasure in her heart.</p>
<p>In the eyes of some wives, many men are like old-fashioned jewelry: it's a pity to throw them away, but they are useless to keep. They don't know how to arrange him. Perhaps she occasionally feels like putting him on, but this is not because of his valuable worth, but just a matter of emotion.</p>
<p>Men have invented substitutes for coal, substitutes for food, substitutes for diamonds, and even substitutes for youth. But they have not invented substitutes for women, substitutes for can openers, and substitutes for pants.</p>
<p>Freedom is sweeter than coffee for women, but the moment of a man's first kiss is sweeter than freedom and coffee.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Trip to Hangzhou (Part 1): Huang Jiping</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou YMCA recently formed a Journalism Research Society. Its purpose is to arouse young people's interest in studying journalism and to provide a platform for those in the journalism field to exchange knowledge. Recently, the society specially invited senior journalist Ge Gongzhen to give a lecture. I also went with him. First, we exchanged letters and decided to depart by night train one day and return on the 5th. The intention of this trip was to observe the social situation of Hangzhou in addition to sightseeing. Unfortunately, the summer heat was overwhelming and the time was short, so I did not gain much. I write this down in a haphazard manner, just to fill a space.</p>
<p>The express train was delayed that night and only left the North Station at 6:20. I leaned against the window and looked out idly. The area north of Shanghai is densely packed with factories, which is probably the most prosperous industrial area of Shanghai. Looking back to the west, there were vegetable gardens, ridges, bamboo fences, and thatched huts. Separated by a single track, the material disparity was almost like being in a different world. Leaving Longhua, the golden crow set in the west, and the scenery outside the window could no longer be distinguished. Sitting upright in the carriage, Mr. Ge recounted his experiences of traveling around the world the year before. The prosperity of the cities and the wild scenery of the villages were quite interesting. He also showed the films of the news industry in various countries that he had brought with him, explaining them to me one by one. I learned about the large newspaper offices and news agencies of Britain, America, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Seeing the spaciousness of their buildings, the completeness of their organizations, the intensity of their work, and the breadth of their business, one could not help but admire them. Each newspaper office spared no expense in using science to strive for perfection, wanting the news to be accurate. They hired experts to conduct interviews and used telephoto photography to verify the information, seeking to deliver the news quickly. They had their own trains, airplanes, and transport ships to deliver the news across the country in three to four hours, aiming to provide convenience. They set up their own factories to manufacture machinery, paper, ink. In addition to daily newspapers, they also published morning editions, noon editions, evening editions, and night editions. Events of the day were recorded in the newspapers of the same day. I realized that modern newspapers have reached the extreme of capitalization, specialization, and scientification, beyond what we can imagine. They have already realized what we can't achieve. Other examples include the communication agencies that manipulate public opinion, such as Reuters in Britain, Associated Press in the United States, Continental Telegraph Company in Germany, Agence Havas in France, and Rengo News Agency in Japan. They sent personnel to various capitals to organize a communication network. Whenever something happened, there was a report. They manipulated the right and wrong, and small countries suffered greatly. Our country's diplomatic failures over the years have mostly been affected by their counter-propaganda... I</p>
<p>Listened to his words with a sense of awe. Mr. and Mrs. American Mingside, who were sitting in the same seat with me, understood Chinese and were delighted to hear us talking so enthusiastically. I exchanged pleasantries with them. They said they had been traveling in Hangzhou for 20 years and were very familiar with the local customs. We talked about the national customs of China and the United States and laughed together. We arrived in Hangzhou at 11 o'clock, where newspaper colleagues and close friends had been waiting for a long time.</p>
<h3>Record of the Autumn Pavilion: Jing Mengdie</h3>
<p>The reason for the existence of the Autumn Pavilion in the Mei Garden is due to the autumn of the Bingyin year and completed in the Wuwu year. It is called Autumn Red to record the fact. The one who named it was the owner, but it was the creation of nature. Previously, there was a clump of peonies in front of the pavilion. That year, in the ninth autumn, when the chrysanthemums were about to bloom, the thousands of chrysanthemums in the garden were still in bud, as if waiting for something. One day, the owner was talking with me in the mansion when the gardener suddenly reported that the peony was blooming. Alas, Tao Yuanming's three paths actually learned from peach trees. The Yao and Wei families were replaced by the Li family, which is indeed a unique case. The owner was delighted to hear this and immediately invited me to go and see it with him. Upon arrival, I saw a pot specially placed on the table, with deep purple flowers and green leaves supporting it, truly resembling the spring colors.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of a Trip to the East (12): Qian Hua</h3>
<p>Regarding equipment, the Mainichi Shimbun has one American-made high-speed photogravure printing press that can print 120,000 copies per hour, and another high-speed machine that can print 72,000 copies per hour, 12 presses, 14 type-casting machines, seven stereotype machines, six photoengraving machines, one telephoto photogravure machine, and seven aircrafts, over one hundred carrier pigeons. There are 685 employees and 1,442 workers. The Asahi Shimbun is even more exquisite and complete, with 17 ultra-high-speed Asahi-style rotary presses that can print 130,000 copies per hour, one German-made four-color printing rotary press, two American-made rotary presses, nine flatbed printing presses, one telephoto photogravure machine, and 16 aircrafts. The number of employees and workers is about the same as the Mainichi Shimbun. There are 250 carrier pigeons. The news for both newspapers is provided by the employees themselves. They rarely use news from communication agencies such as the Electricity News and Reuters. They use long-distance telephone and aircraft communication throughout the country. Long-distance photos are transmitted by telephoto machines. They set up communication bureaus in various places, each headed by an employee. The same is true overseas. All major cities around the world have correspondents stationed there. The communication network can be said to be tight. Each newspaper earns hundreds of thousands of dollars of profit each year, which is used for public reserve funds, shareholder and employee dividends, employee pensions, and a part is used for the development of social public services. For example, last year, the Osaka Mainichi East Asia Investigation Committee was established, and Count Kiyoura Keigo, Count Uchida Kosai, and Baron Hayashi Gonsuke and ten other people were hired as consultants. The Committee hosted a health promotion sports meet, set up free clinics, and held the 11th National Junior High School Soccer Tournament, the 5th National Women's Sports Games, the 8th National Tennis Player Competition, and provided subsidies for various charitable causes. According to their claims, the consumption of these subsidiary businesses in the past five years has reached 2 million yen. The Asahi Shimbun's subsidiary businesses have been most successful in developing aviation and sports. Its aviation and sports departments are full of talent and were once extremely prosperous. The Asahi Sports Monthly, hosted by the sports department, is particularly praised. Its sales cover the entire country. The aviation department has 16 aircrafts. In January of the Taisho 12th year (1923), Asahi sponsored the start of regular air service between Tokyo and Osaka. On August 17 of the Showa 3rd year (1928), it began to transport passengers and mail, and its business was extremely developed, opening a new era in the Japanese aviation industry. Last April 1, the business was taken over by Japan Air Transport Co., Ltd. Over the years, Asahi lost 732,391 yen. In addition, Asahi bore 408,972 yen for the long-distance flight to Europe. Last year, it held the International Water Sports Competition and the East-West Confrontation Track and Field Sports Meet. Also last year, for the 50th anniversary of Asahi, various celebrations were extremely prosperous, and it proposed 500,000 yen in subsidies for various social undertakings and 1 million yen to be distributed as rewards to all employees. The Asahi Shimbun used the power of aviation to make its news particularly outstanding. It was fast and accurate, which other newspapers could not match. For example, three years ago, when Zhang Zuolin was bombed in Huanggu Tun, Asahi quickly sent five aircrafts to collect news. The next morning, the photos and news were dazzling, and people are still praising them. Other companies, such as the Osaka Jiji Shinpo, also had slight surpluses each year, but they were not as good as Asahi and Mainichi.</p>
<p>That is also the reason. Why would there be red in the deep autumn? Perhaps the god of spring loves famous gardens, so he made an uninvited visit. This is enough to break the record of the Luoyang flower catalog. When the viewers became crowded, they all said that peony belongs to wealthy flowers, competing to congratulate the owner for his late success. I said that wealth is not very important to the owner. However, to see the spring glory again in the bleak autumn season is like a person being old but not aging. This is a sign of longevity and is enough to praise the owner. The owner thought it was true, so he ordered a photograph to record the event. I wrote a poem titled: "It is not Henan or Luoyang; The flower king is seen in the season of yellow flowers; He especially uses the national color to intoxicate the autumn color; Who says that the heavenly fragrance occupies the late fragrance? The old scene teaches people to boast of wealth; The delicate appearance is also resistant to wind and frost; Long spring foreshadows the blessing of the god of spring; A tree of wonderful flowers reports auspiciousness."</p>
<p>The pavilion is located to the west of the Songbin Hall, so it has no name. The owner recently told me that he would personally write the three characters "Autumn Red Pavilion" to adorn it. Mr. Sun Songtuo also made a couplet for it: "Brew a small spring in September, famous flowers bloom in autumn; Collect a pavilion in ten thousand acres, the beautiful scenery is natural." I also used the Phoenix-crown style to embed the two characters "Autumn Red" into a couplet: "Autumn season sees spring glory; the scenery of September resides with the God of Spring; Red sincerity maintains the national plan; the famous traces of Five Lakes continue Zhu Gong." This pavilion is located near the Five Lakes, facing the Taozhu Pavilion on Yuanzhu Island from afar. The owner has always attached importance to education in addition to running real estate. He always speaks of producing and teaching. He has long admired the personality of Fan Shaobo.</p>
<p>Brief News: Changsha Quan Juanzhi, an old man known for his calligraphy, has long been admired at home and abroad. Recently, at the request of the Weiran Calligraphy and Painting Society, he set a rate to meet the desires of those who love the old man's ink treasures. Inquiries can be sent to No. 1324, Intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Hede Road.</p>
<p>Lin Gui Kuang Youhan, painted ancient style landscape fans at the request of fellow students of Xilu, following the old practice of reducing the price in the summer for two months. Inquiries about the reduced price can be sent to Kuang Xiaosong, 3rd floor, Shenbao.</p>
<h3>Heartfelt Warmth (336) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Farewell Banquet, Parting Feast, Holding Flowers to Capture a Beautiful Image; Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Competition to Behold Elegant Charms</p>
<p>Zuo Shichen said, "I'm hungry. Let's find a place to have supper. After supper, we'll go to other places." Long Ziyun said, "There's Japanese cuisine here. It's said that the wife of the head of Mitsui &amp; Co. is in charge there. Japanese people, regarding that kind of voluntary garden party, many noble ladies participate. Let's go and have a look." Zuo Shichen said, "I can't speak Japanese; it's no fun." Long Ziyun said, "I can manage a few simple sentences. Fortunately, Japan and we share the same writing system. Where language fails, we can still communicate with writing. Just use a pencil and paper and write it for them. Besides, we haven't had Japanese food in a long time. Why not try it today?" Zuo Shichen agreed. The two walked into the Japanese restaurant. Sure enough, there were several Japanese beauties dressed in finery who came to greet them. They were very respectful to the guests. Fortunately, they didn't recognize who they were. The menu was printed, a combination of Chinese and Japanese. Even if there was no Chinese, they could still understand the Japanese. They also ordered a bottle of Taiyo Beer. They saw a young girl carrying a bottle of wine and two glasses on a purple lacquered tray, placing them on the table. She bowed deeply. Long and Zuo saw that she was a student, not a servant. They didn't know whose daughter she was and could only return her bow. However, they were somewhat burdened afterward. Every time she brought a dish, she would bow. They had to return the bow at least once. After finishing this Japanese meal, they didn't know how many bows they had made or how many courtesies they had returned. Zuo Shichen smiled and said to Long Ziyun, "Well, this overly courteous banquet, no matter how grand, didn't have every dish require a bow. Eating this Japanese food is too uneconomical." Long Ziyun said, "That's not it. You have to know that they are used to sitting on the floor. Also, they consider themselves versed in etiquette. When sitting on the floor, everyone is kneeling. Even bowing to you only requires placing both hands on the ground and leaning forward. Moreover, women are subordinate to men. For example, when they have guests at home, when his wife serves wine and food, she even kowtows every time. The woman considers it a matter of course, while the husband simply ignores her. Now, they are not sitting on the floor here, so they deliberately kowtow to make a bow. In reality, they are accustomed to it. Without doing so, they cannot be considered versed in etiquette." After finishing the Japanese food, Long Ziyun paid the bill and they came out. It was already past eight o'clock, and the number of visitors was gradually increasing. Over there was a tea tasting area. It was originally a vegetable garden. Now, beside the eastern corner, there was a bamboo grove with dozens of seats. It was said that the owner of Wei Garden set it up himself.</p>

<h3>Financial Silver Bar Stability</h3>

<p>Yarn Flower: The yarn market is even more clear and quiet</p>
<p>The yarn market is extremely calm, with both long and short parties holding a wait-and-see attitude. The overseas flower yarn market is also stable, but most minds in the market are looking low due to the chaotic situation and the large amount of bottom goods. The current sales of various gangs are not smooth, and they all hold a selling strategy when prices rise. Only the three-grade yarn has rebounded by two or three yuan, but the buying attitude is firm. As the season is currently in the autumn sales season, they are also tightening and unwilling to let go, it is said.</p>
<p>There are still many vacant lots in the human label. The human label pre-market opening situation is extremely flat and there are few transactions. There are still many vacant lots.

<h3>Cotton Market Has No Development</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very tired because no one has received goods in recent months, and the market atmosphere is quite lax. The distant months are affected by it. The trend of American cotton is relatively stable, but people's minds in this port have not been excited because most minds think that the price of Indian cotton is cheaper and look low. Every time there is a slight rise, they sell, and a certain large manufacturer's new cotton is becoming more and more oppressive. Without special changes, it is difficult to rise. The transaction volume of cotton in August has gradually increased, and the current number of bags is more than 90,000, which shows the strength of the competition between the two sides, it is said.</p>
<p>In the near future, the long position will be cut off. The Hanbiao pre-market opened, the market atmosphere was still flat, but later the long position in this month ended and was weak. Each month fell by 5 cents to 1 qian. In the afternoon, the near month fell by 1 qian, and the distant fell by 5 cents. The total daily transaction statistics were 34,200 dan. Check that Maji Jifeng Yijiang Yuantai Yichang Xinhang Yuangongtai Tianchang bought 900 dan to 2,700 dan.</p>

<h3>Grain River Below Rice Market Is Not Prosperous</h3>
<p>Inland Sources Are Connected</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, more than ten ships arrived from Huangdu, all of which were japonica rice. At the moment, there are gradually more than 30 ships in the river. The price has dropped due to the wild drop in foreign rice, and the price of local production has declined. Therefore, the general market has opened at 21 yuan, and the limit market. Therefore, the Rice Merchants Association has requested the authorities to cancel the evaluation and registration, etc., and restore the previous rules, and the Rice Merchants Association directly sells and buys, so as to avoid losses. Therefore, there were no transactions throughout the day. According to the Social Bureau's organization of the evaluation committee to restrict rice prices, it was stated that it would be revoked within the limit market. At the moment, the association is requesting to restore the original situation based on this situation, which is legitimate. However, rice shops have recently sold retail for 23-24 yuan, because it is difficult to investigate the retail sales in the market. Therefore, there are occasional dark market private posts, etc., so to strictly equalize rice prices, the first thing to do is to inspect the retail sales of rice shops, because residents have no invoices for their purchases and it is difficult to ask the price. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this. The goods are scarce and the market is quiet. The circulation is still stable and the transactions are sparse. The general market continues to be around 19 yuan. In short, the production and sales markets are uniformly soft at the moment, and it is not surprising that there will be a large drop in inventory.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Three or four ships of rice arrived from the river below. This street picks and enters cleverly, and the market situation is not prosperous. The Su Tong japonica rice is only opening at 20 yuan, and the market transaction is extremely small, because the recent retail sales in rural villages have been affected by the madness of foreign rice, and there is a lack of appetite, so although there has been no strong arrival in the north and south recently, people are not panicked. There is a slight opening of goat indica rice, and the market is weak. The sales of white yuan are deserted, and the prices of ordinary goods are only around 18 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Turns Up After Falling</h3>
<p>Down Half a Yuan in the Morning... Up Three Jiao in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the digestion of foreign rice was very dull in the morning, and people were even more bearish. Floating more contested sales, and the entry door was few. The market price suddenly had half a yuan of huge, the large and small are twisted because the existing arrival is more, more soft than other rice, but until the afternoon, the Pingtiao office stomach is alive. This client gang also thinks that the price decline is cost-effective and competes to buy. The market immediately saw a turning point, and the market price also returned to three yuan. The unified market sells open small twist 5,000 packages price 15 yuan and half to 1 angle, big twist 3,000 packages, price 14 yuan 1 angle to 13 yuan 2 angle half, Saigon No. 2 1,300 packages, price 15 yuan 4 angle half to 3 angle. Another 500 bags of No. 1, price 17 yuan, high 17 yuan 8 angle, small twist brown 2,000 bags, price 13 yuan half to 2 angle, Qi Yedi brown 300 bags, price 14 yuan 2 angle, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Powder Market Enters a Stable Path</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly showed a swirling state, because the foreign wheat quotation was only a small one or two angles, and the speculators had no basis in their minds. Recently, they have been watching with actual sales, and there have only been sporadic transactions, so the market atmosphere is not good. The distant period is because the decline in the past few days has been relatively severe, and those who are thinking about it are concentrated, and the difference between the near and distant periods is almost the same. The large households have also started arbitrage business, which has caused the minds of the distant period to be slightly higher. Looking at the follow-up situation, because the manufacturer's chips are currently released less, this kind of market can be temporarily stabilized in the future. As a result, this month is 2.5% lower than the previous day, 5% lower in August and September, 2.5% better in October and November, and unchanged in December, it is said.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Speculators Absorb Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>Spot Goods, Both New and Old Grades, Decrease by Four to Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening bell, futures wheat prices generally remained stable throughout the morning and afternoon. This month, due to small and medium-sized factories all wanting to take the opportunity to win over their workers, demand was quite strong. In early August, things were still stable. However, with inland merchants continuing to sell off their holdings, the market weakened again. As for the forward contracts, large speculators covered their short positions and absorbed a significant amount of wheat, leading to a slight increase in market momentum. According to industry insiders, factories will naturally need to maintain prices until actual sales improve. Once sales pick up, the market will undoubtedly change. As a result, the current month is up two cents from the previous day, August is down two cents, September is unchanged, October is up one cent, November is up two cents, and December is up one cent. Overall spot wheat trading remains sluggish due to the scarcity of high-quality goods on the market, with mostly medium-grade and lower-grade wheat available. This lack of quality has discouraged factory purchases. Although customers want to sell, they have no viable options. Consequently, asking prices for both new and old grades have decreased by four to five cents. Shandong old wheat, Xuzhou Yao,</p>
<p>and Wan wheat were offered, totaling over 2,800 bags, reportedly purchased by Fufeng.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: New Golden Needles Sold Out Upon Arrival</p>
<p>Market Price: Twenty-Six Taels</p>
<p>The first batch of new golden needle vegetables arrived from Zhenjiang the day before yesterday, totaling 112 bags from Zhongxing Vegetables. These were independently procured by various merchants and were of good quality. The market price was set at twenty-six taels. Merchants from various regions, hearing the news, eagerly purchased samples. Sales were particularly brisk among merchants from Xiamen and Fuzhou, with the entire batch selling out immediately. It is rumored that the second batch, consisting of new Daxing vegetables, will arrive soon.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Dougon Cocoons Exported More Smoothly</p>
<p>Total Exports for Last Month: 418 Bales</p>
<p>In recent years, the demand for Dougon cocoons from France and Japan has remained healthy. Overseas silk mills use the spun silk to weave items like neckties. Last month, during the transition period between new and old Dougon cocoons, exports were particularly smooth. Total exports for June amounted to 418 bales, an increase of 121 bales compared to May.</p>
<h3>Keemun Scented Tea Trading Booming</h3>
<p>British and Russian Firms Compete Fiercely in Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Keemun scented black tea from both Keemun and Ningzhou regions was actively traded. The Russian Cooperative has launched large-scale purchases, and British firms are also eagerly buying, leading to brisk transactions. However, the Russian firm's bidding is extremely tight, resulting in losses for many Chinese tea merchants. As for the green tea market, the overall trend remains difficult to consider positive. Although a small amount of high-grade Zhenxia tea has been sold, the asking price has already fallen by four to five taels compared to before. The market conditions for Needle Eyebrow and Show Eyebrow teas are also more sluggish than last week. However, the market momentum for high-grade Gongxi tea remains strong. Metals: Association Steel Reaches Its Peak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the estimated price of Association Steel reached twenty-five taels per box, marking the highest record since its arrival in Shanghai. However, merchants from various regions are not deterred, and yesterday's asking prices reached a new peak. Old steel factory goods were offered at twenty-six taels, new steel factory goods at twenty-five taels, and "wild chicken" (unofficial) goods at twenty-three taels and five qian. It is reported that six to seven hundred boxes have been sold daily, with local factories being the largest buyers.</p>

<h3>The Poetry of Black People by Yang Changxi</h3>
<p>The system of black slavery in America has undergone a long history. They turned and tossed in the life of slaves, working hard day and night for the deep authority of their masters. They felt that white people were specially created by God to oppress them, and they believed that their suffering was driven by fate. Therefore, in their long history, there was no resistance or accusation. However, since Lincoln formally liberated the black slaves, in the past fifty or sixty years, black people have gradually gained status economically, socially, and professionally. Apart from the stable lives of those who have acquired American citizenship, the majority of black people still live in a disguised form of slavery, with the difference that the abuse is relatively less.</p>
<p>Therefore, the liberated black people have gained educational opportunities. The various inequalities between ethnic groups felt by intellectuals are reflected in literature.</p>
<p>In our complete review of American black poetry, we can discover the following types of thinking:</p>
<p>(1) Forgetting the suffering they endure in reality, believing that they will never find comfort and happiness in this world, and taking conversion to God as their only consolation. They do not think of relieving the pain of reality, but only want to die early, only want "to go to heaven, sit on the throne of angels, eat the treasures of the angels... to be comfortable and happy, I and my God, can do whatever we want." Only wanting "the sweet and lovely car to sway and lower, it is coming to take me home... By my ability I have carefully investigated Canaan (GORDAND), behind me there is a team of angels, they are coming to take me home." In this kind of poetry, the former is the sad groan of black people in slave life who yearn for freedom, completely wanting to escape the oppression and suffering of the world. The latter is a hymn dreaming of Canaan, comparing themselves to the Israelite refugees who suffered in ancient Egypt, dreaming that God has chosen the fertile Canaan for them black slaves as the residence of the chosen people. However, earthly suffering is not lessened by the praise of God. Only in the religious anesthetic that is used by white people can it reduce their hatred of white people and eliminate their national consciousness. Not only can the dreamed-of Canaan not become the kingdom of the chosen people,</p>
<p>but even their motherland, Africa, has no place for them.</p>
<p>(2) The attitude of contentment. They praise the forests and thickets under the scorching heat of Africa, recall the situation in their hometown when they were young, sing the beauty of black girls, chant the material civilization of the United States, and praise the scenery of nature. This is because they have gone from being slaves to having the opportunity to receive higher education, and with a relatively better social status, they can safely chant everything without using literature as a signal to awaken national consciousness. Furthermore, perhaps some of them have already become American citizens and are singing, "I am the darker brother, when friends come to treat them, they call me to eat in the kitchen, but I smile, eat well, and grow strong... Tomorrow when friends come to treat them, I can sit at the table, and no one dares to say to me, go to the kitchen to eat... They can see how beautiful I am, how ashamed they are... Ah, I am also an American." They throw their whole body and mind into the kingdom of the white people.</p>
<p>(3) The performance of loyal slaves. Because they have lost their national identity after being immersed and molded for many years, they do not understand what the difference between white people and black people is, nor do they understand whether their masters' lives are slavery, and they are very loyal to their work. Therefore, in all the poems of black people, the most loved by workers are the more than ten poems describing John Henry (JOHN HENRY), which profoundly depict how black people have simply become loyal slaves after more than a hundred years of molding. Although some poems believe that John Henry is a railroad worker, and some believe that they are loyal steel workers, John Henry is loyal to his profession and decides to work day and night, deciding to die holding a hammer is common. Therefore, in a poem most loved by workers, Henry only says, "One person is always one person, I will always work with everyone, I will definitely die holding a hammer." He even said to his supervisor, "A person is finally a person, I will work day and night, and decide to die holding a hammer." But later, when he went up the mountain to strike down the steam drilling rig, because the stone was too high and his strength was too small, he finally died when he put down the hammer. In another poem, the last words Henry said to his son before his death were that he hoped he would not do other things, but still be a steel worker like his father who had sacrificed his life. In this kind of poetry, it fully represents the loyal slave nature of a part of black people, and hopes that his son will inherit his career. This type of worker, John Henry, is praised and expected by white people.</p>
<p>However, these three kinds of performances are gradually overcome by the trend of the times. Because the oppressed and small nations in the world all want to break free from the shackles and run to a state of freedom and independence, the national awakening presented in recent black literature, especially in poetry, is more acute.</p>
<p>In the great disparity between the lives of masters and slaves, they have already felt that "the wife lives in a high-rise building, the nanny lives in the backyard, the wife holds a white hand to play, the nanny works hard all the time... the masters always ride horses, the black slaves work around him all the time, the masters sleep during the day, the black slaves dig underground" the suffering and happiness is too far apart. Moreover, the black slaves who hold hoes in the hot sun all day long to strongly pick seabird droppings for the masters as fertilizer, describe "white people wearing starched shirts sitting in the shade, God has given birth to the laziest people." And the conversion to God has lost faith, and the black people who have been reduced to the status of slaves have reached the position of national self-consciousness. Therefore, they sing, "Hey, I am black, but I am also black and lovable, I am as dark as the son of night, as dark as the deep cave, I am a tender branch belonging to a slave race, he cooperated to build a strong country, then you and I can get equal treatment in the world, courageous and strong like those people on the turbulent waves, holding up a banner high, her fluttering overthrows all opposition." It is a deep statement that the need to build an independent country is a major problem that black people feel today. Therefore, the American critic V. F. CALVERTON believes in his introduction to "The Anthology of American Black Literature" that "the starting point of black literature is national, and it is created for the national self-consciousness, singing for the national suffering, not for art for art's sake, and the rise of black literature will achieve the rise of the entire nation in the future due to the growth of literature," which can further confirm that black people must focus on national freedom and liberation for the problem of the future. Therefore, I will first talk about the poems that can fully express the black people's self-consciousness. Let me make another review of the performance of national consciousness in the novel later.</p>

<h3>Celebration of Pinero's Seventy-First Birthday</h3>
<p>Pinero is a great modern British playwright. He is praised by the modern critic William Archer as "a thoughtful and fair writer." His plays always tell the story of "a woman with a past history." He and Shaw, Carpenter, Wilde, and Wells (the great historian) were all dangerous figures at the time.</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (180) Written by John Macy of the United States, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 47 American Novels</p>
<p>On the side of a mountain in New Hampshire, high up there is a cluster of rocks that form a huge human face, which is one of the natural wonders of the world and a sight known to all travelers. Hawthorne made "The Old Man of the Mountain" particularly his own. He imagined what kind of influence this would have on sensitive children growing up in its shadow. Therefore, in "The Great Stone Face," he thought of it as a symbol, an inspiration. He transformed the rock into a poetic sermon. Before Hawthorne wrote, New England was not known as "The Land of Fairies," but after he wrote, Romance adopted that place as one of its permanent residences.</p>
<p>Cooper and Irving and Hawthorne saw their works popular during their lifetime, and enjoyed as much practical prosperity as the author required. They never lacked clothes, meals, or comfortable beds. Their younger contemporary who died earlier, Edgar Allan Poe, struggled with poverty in that short life. The world did not recognize him as America's greatest writer until after his death. No other American has had such a strong influence on European literature. In 1909, the centenary of Poe's birth, from New York to Moscow, any writer with the power acknowledged that he or his country owed to Poe's genius.</p>
<p>Poe is above romance writers. He is the creator of novel, original short stories, and also a poet and critic. However, if there is no other reason except to say that the story of his life itself is romance, and Poe is a character in a real novel, and the main material of novels and dramas, then it is fair to regard him as a romance writer. The theme of that story is appealing to our feelings, whether or not it is specifically American, appealing to our feelings of praise for those who proceed in difficult circumstances. We in the business world, in the political world, like self-made people. Of course, no one is self-made, but if we interpret this term in the ordinary sense, we can call Poe a self-made writer. Needless to say, he was born with talent, but he struggled to maintain the purity of that talent, to develop it in disappointment and difficulty.</p>
<p>When Poe was twenty-four years old, he won a prize of one hundred gold dollars awarded by a newspaper in Baltimore, Maryland, for a short story called "MS. Found in a Bottle". Two points about this novel are noteworthy. This immediately showed Poe's ability to drive style and technique, and probably this was the only novel he got enough reward for. Why? Because Poe did not live his poor life by his most beautiful novels, and of course not by his poems, but by hard magazine work and rigid editorial affairs. He was a careful worker, and he could not do hasty work just for the sake of urgently waiting for money. The history of literature records many events about poverty and hardship and the sacrifice of material well-being for artistic ideals, but the glorious example of the literary profession, above Poe's example, does not exist. He was a man who proudly believed in his ability, and had the happy pride of knowing that his best works were stamped with immortality. It is inappropriate for those who lament his poverty, or complain that the world he lived in ignored genius, to complain. However, there is a small scene or fact that dramatizes his life. He had been a cadet at the United States Military Academy for several months. Sixteen years later, when his wife was dying, the only thing covering her bed was his military uniform.</p>
<p>Poe's novels describe mysterious realms and the influence of those realms on the human mind. His absorbing interest is in what is now becoming a thing called psychological habit. He created detective novels long before Sherlock Holmes and Arsène Lupin were born. In his view, detective novels are not at all a question of whether the criminal is arrested and punished. This is entirely a logical part of the mind, the question of how to act before the facts. He not only invented detective novels, the best ones being "The Purloined Letter" and "The Murders in the Rue Morgue," but also made the novel "The Mystery of Marie Roget" by taking an actual event that was not yet clear when he wrote it. The structure is almost no different from the real event. Later, it was determined that Poe was extremely proud of what he called his own reasoning power, believing and proving that whatever mystery, mechanical or intellectual, a person could conceive, others could always decompose it.</p>
<p>It is rare to see a poet and dreamer like Poe who has the ability to develop that ability for pure reason to such a high level among writers. This is not to say that there is something incompatible between reason and poetry, but quite the opposite. We know that Dante and Shakespeare and Goethe were capable in all thoughtful departments. However, it is rare for all kinds of abilities to be given to one person's mind. As time goes on, we are more and more sure to understand that Poe, whose brilliant heyday was interrupted before he reached the peak of his power, is a rare and supreme talent.</p>
<p>Poe's mysterious stories with ingenious reasoning, I am afraid, are clever tricks only. Although in three-quarters of the same century, no other writer was clever enough to surpass him. His most beautiful prose is not found in his creative stories, but in works that have a direct influence on emotions and feelings, like poetry or music. Works like "Ligeia" and "Shadow" are complete. If Poe was not the originator of that kind of prose poem, whatever original creation traces something that came before it is possible, then he is still the magician of that bewitching magic and there is no enemy, the poet Swinburne called Poe "always" thoroughly grinding out his own thoughts, from which he created or a solid, mature, and immortal thing. "A complete genius poet," Poe is complete in two senses. He brought his thoughts to the last form and completed them, and he had a great multi-faceted talent. His short stories are enough to give him fame, but even without that, he should also be remembered as a critic and poet.</p>
<p>Some of Poe's criticisms have lost their original interest because the books that aroused his criticism were of little value, and would have been forgotten without his criticism. However, even in the momentary criticisms in the newspapers, he often expressed a kind of thought with lasting value in literature. On the whole, his literary essays have more light and knowledge than any other American at that time. For general readers and specialized researchers, these are becoming the best narratives of American literature before 1850. He maintained the banner of exquisite works for himself and others in extremely unfavorable circumstances. For his immortal reputation, let him be remembered. He almost lifted his banner alone and proceeded, and it was extremely rare to have the courage and strength and a kind of proper modesty to follow his contemporaries. What makes Poe's residence in America and writing in America an eternally incomprehensible problem for European critics is no worse than the obscurity of his stories or the beauty of his poems. The superiority of his criticism is an example of the incomprehensible truth that great intelligence can be born in any environment. How or why such a thing happens, no one can explain. This is one of the living romantic mysteries that Poe himself cannot reason to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>Among the writers of the first half of the same century, there were people who were quite important at the time and are still memorable today, namely Mrs. Stowe, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" gave people an impression beyond what dreams or expectations she had when writing it. Lincoln tasted it with more than the precise courage of a historical figure and called her "a little lady who stirred up this great war." Tolstoy, who often seeks moral problems in novels, added it to the extremely limited list of books that he called true art. In my opinion, this seems to belong to second-rate art. Why? Because this is a special debate, propaganda, not raising the work to something that is so clear that it stimulates the urgent problem that sparked it. However, apart from or a kind of old-fashioned moral theory, this is not badly written. The story is vivid, and the pure passion triumphs over the vivid sentimentality.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, in the era of gradual maturity, there were three writers who occupied the first important position, and a few writers with less real value. The three were Mark Twain, Howells, and Henry James.</p>

Now, taking advantage of the convenience of the National Goods Commercial Market organized by the Chinese people (inside the Municipal Government Hall on Nanjing Road), we have specially displayed all our exquisite and novel products, such as sundries, toys, stationery, and cosmetics, in the market for the convenience of Chinese people to choose and buy. All patriotic gentlemen will naturally be happy to use them, and so on.</p>
<p>The Liang Chen Hao You She (Good Times Friends Society) at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road announces: Our society has always been renowned for its exquisitely made Liang Chen stationery. For those who order stationery and envelopes for ten yuan or more before the end of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, a Zhang Zhenlu calligraphy Ma Henian painting fan head will be given as a gift.

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Guo Feng New Drama Society announces: The National Goods Department Store on Nanjing Road has now opened. In the Tong Le Amusement Park, there is an organization of our society. The main characters we hired, such as Zhang Xiao Tian, Zhang Yong Cui, Wang Dai Gong, Wang Yan Bing, Wang Meng Sheng, Wu Ji Chen, Wang Xue Mei, etc., are all top talents who are famous for a time. Moreover, we have also specially invited Zheng Zheng Qiu, a new drama master, and several famous figures in the theater world who have not been on stage for a long time to join as guest performers. With such a lineup, it is certainly satisfactory. Li Ci Hang (also known as Jun Pan), who is in charge of the society's affairs, is also an advanced figure in spoken drama. Initially, he and Zhong Sheng Mu Duo, Ren Tian Zhi, and Lu Jing Ru, a key member of the Chun Liu Society, were all strong players who worked hard in new drama. In the first year of the Republic of China, they founded the Kai Ming New Drama Society, which achieved excellent results. Later, in Changsha, Hunan, and other places, he performed dramas with Gu Wu Wei, Chen Da Bei, and Zou Jian Hun.</p>
<p>He also had considerable prestige. However, in the past ten years, he has been almost isolated from the theater world. Although, when he is in the mood, he sometimes writes scripts. The play "Common Struggle," which he wrote when boycotting Japanese goods two years ago, was published in the Min Guo Daily. "Personality Problems," a one-act play published in the Red Rose magazine recently, is also his work. This time, because everyone is advocating domestic goods, he has also shown a little enthusiasm and accepted the invitation of the head of the amusement park to prepare to perform several dramas that promote domestic goods and promote national glory, fulfilling his duty of propaganda. At the same time, he wants to make another effort in theatrical arts, hoping to revive the declining new drama. However, he has been away from the stage for too long, and he is inevitably a little unfamiliar with the control of the drama. Therefore, he has specially invited Wu Ji Chen, who is experienced in this field, to serve as the director of choreography for the society. Wu has a solid foundation, rich thoughts, and creative specialties in drama. "Fragrant Grass in the Horizon" of the Min Xing Society and "The Maze on the Sea" of the Laughing Stage are his proud works. This time, he has assumed the position of director of choreography for the Guo Feng Society. With so many good actors on stage together, how handy it is! It is expected that once it starts, there will be excellent works that adapt to the times and satisfy the audience, appearing in the entertainment section of the National Goods Department Store, and so on.</p>
<p>The Paris Theater announces: Starting today, our theater will screen the unprecedented blockbuster "Aristocratic Rivalry," starring the great star Ms. Laura, made with millions of dollars. The scenery is magnificent, and the plot is tortuous and delicate. Its depiction of the romance of the aristocracy in the Russian Empire era and the affection of the actresses can be described as vivid. This is indeed a rare and excellent film, and so on.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Drama Research Institute's affiliated drama school, which is presided over by Ouyang Yuqian, a key member of the Shanghai Drama Association, has been established for more than a year. Its successive performances have achieved success. Now, in order to expand the school's operations and organize special classes to perform Mandarin spoken dramas, it is specially recruiting male and female students for the group in Shanghai. In addition to the fact that the male students have already been recruited last time, it is now continuing to recruit many female students. It has now entrusted the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center at the intersection of Hualong Road and Huanlong Road to handle everything. All female comrades who are interested in stage art can bring a four-and-a-half-inch half-length photo and go to the center to register from now on.</p>
<p>The Hai Xing Film Company announces: The film "Tears of the Cold Palace Song," which our company is about to start filming, is a structure that Mr. Yu Boming has spent many years of painstaking efforts on. Its plot is tortuous and mysterious, tragic and passionate, making people unpredictable. In addition, director Tian Wei Jun can use the correct vision, and cinematographer Dong Tian Duo Jun studies the art of photography day and night. It is expected to be a major contribution in the future. It is now scheduled to go to Hangzhou on August 1 to shoot outdoor scenes, and so on.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>The San Min Company announces: Acupuncturist Wang Meng Zhou is the son of Wang Chuan Jing, the sea god of acupuncture. He is young and knowledgeable. He has inherited his father's mantle and has studied the art of acupuncture. People from all walks of life who love his acupuncture are quite numerous, so his reputation is widely praised. For example, Mr. Feng Mei An and Mrs. Huang Yi Zhai, Shanghai merchants, also suffered from an illness a few days ago. After he injected the magic needle, the disease was immediately cured, which shows that the effect is as magical. Mr. Wang is also good at physiognomy, and his predictions are always accurate, but he is not willing to easily judge people's appearances. He now has a medical residence at No. 359 at the intersection of Laohuo Road and Ningbo Road. He is especially generous to poor patients, and Mr. Wang generously gives needles, which is especially commendable, and so on.</p>
<p>The Chinese Industrial School in Zishou Lane, West Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, announces: Our school principal, Mr. Cao You Guang, in view of the fact that epidemics are prone to occur in the summer season, and residents in the vicinity have no good place to seek medical treatment when they have diseases, and they all feel regretful. Now, starting from the 20th of this month (July), we have specially invited Dr. Shen Wen Bin to be responsible for the consultation time from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day. Dr. Shen has a thorough understanding of medical principles and is well-known in the medical community. Last year, he served as a medical provider in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Joint Association on Song Park Road, Zhabei. There were about hundreds of people who responded effectively, and he has won the trust of the local people, and so on.</p>
