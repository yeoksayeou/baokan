<h3 id="c3">國際聯盟閉會 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>此次國聯開會之前。世人即料其無多大希望。今届閉會而屈指計數其成績果甚鮮少。英外相返英途中。謂國聯會議。雖不若去年之壯觀。但頗饒興趣。且亦有益。英外相之言。固不得不如是。然吾人細究其會議之經過。則所謂有益者。亦甚微矣。會議中最關重要而爲世人所屬望者爲籌備軍縮案。今其報告與議案。雖云通過。但因德奥匈代表未簽字。舉行大會之日期未確定。勢非待至來年不可。故無從言其成績之若何也。修改國聯會章案。羣認爲與凱洛格公約有關係。苟能修改。亦足爲遏止戰爭之助。今亦僅在股員會研究中。防制戰爭條約案意亦在督促履行非戰公約。今僅决定組特别顧問委員會。繼續審查。保護少數民族案。討論時爭辯雖烈。但究其所謂謂解决之道。祗云當於多數與少數民族間之相互信任與合作求之。則其解决猶之未解决也。白晨安之歐聯計劃。雖云各國多數表示贊成。但其結果。仍藉組織委員會審查以延宕之而已。至與此案相關之所謂關稅同盟。迄今亦　然無聞。以上各案。皆與和平前途。有相聯關係。仍進而一課其成績。皆在渺遠而莫可捉摸之際。吾誠未見其有若何裨益矣。除此而外。必欲强數其成績。則在外通過一以財力佽助被攻國之公約。在會内則舉定理事數人。與决定改組秘書處之大綱而巳雖然。此其情勢。非出於意外者也。以國聯之歷史言之。以各國之環境觀之宜其成績之僅此而止也。</p>

<p>茲論中國稅收制度中間接稅之地位、關於印花稅、本委員會已於一九二九年一月十八日提出之文件印花稅法草案及其理由書中、加以詳論、除此以外、即爲對於物品之間接稅、</p>
<p>目下國民政府之收入、大部份仰給於海關、其中尤以輸人稅爲主、以情勢度之、此項稅收、雖在多年以後、將不失爲中國收入所仰賴之大宗財源、大凡舊稅較新稅易於徵收、關稅久已認爲中國賦稅制度之一部故其徵收自較新稅爲易、並因比較上關稅不受政局動搖之影響、其行政上效能較大於一般内地稅行政、綜此種種原因、若能於規定稅則時詳加考慮、則自關稅輪入稅項下增加收入、較諸自其他稅源增加必更易也、自行政方面言之、中國稅收固應倚賴輪入關稅、但其他方面亦加以考慮、尤應顧及賦稅之負擔、對於較貧階級所應用之物品課以進口稅時、其於物品價格發生若何影響、此誠爲吾人不可不研究之問題茲第就本題述其梗概於次、</p>
<p>輸入貨中大部分爲中國較貧階級應用者、以棉織品火油紙烟火柴輕質木料及針爲大宗、此　物品在一九二五至一九二八年間、自外國輸入者、每年平均價值爲關平銀三五三·○○○·○○○兩、實佔輸入貨總額三分之一、此數額雖非全然表示關稅所加於貧民階級之負擔、但稅率之增加、能限於上述以外之輸入貨、並就所課稅</p>
<p>率爲適當之規定、則輪入貨之稅收額、當較現在徵收者爲大、一方面於貧民之負擔得免顯著之加重、他方面亦不致重累任何階級、</p>
<p>謂海關輸入稅不致重累貧民、自有相當理由、謂中國稅收制度之其他部分足以重累貧民、亦不庸疑義、請先就鹽稅言之、</p>
<p>鹽爲生活必須品、不問貧民富民、其消費之量不相懸殊、况處理鹽稅之徵收又不適當、即傳處理適當、而各人所繳之稅額、决不因各人繳稅能力之不同而有差異、夫人民之經濟能力當爲納稅之標準、今事實上乃反其道而行之、換言之、此種輕於富人而重於貧民之賦稅、實爲不公平之賦稅、雖各項物品賦稅中多少寓有此種不公平性質、然於日用必需品如食鹽者而施以此項賦稅、則尤爲顯著、此外如常關稅復輸入稅、以及中國各口往還稅、亦有同樣之情形、</p>
<p>此項賦稅旣有重累貧民之影響則於製定稅收制度時、努力於此種不公平賦稅之剷除、不特爲賢明之政策、抑亦深合人道主義也、</p>
<p>本委員會基於此種理由、特建議火柴及水泥消費稅之徵收、此類物品之課稅、固亦規定於特别消費稅條例中、但本委員會建議前述二種之淌費稅、非直接向消費者徵收、而向生産者徵收之、此種賦稅所以稱爲消費稅者、即因此項稅欵通常加於物價之内、以致納稅者即爲消費物品之人也、</p>
<p>現行特别消費稅條例各條規定有足庇議者若干點、該條例包括廣泛之繳稅貨物、致此種賦稅對於社會可能發生之影響、無從估量、即關於稅率高低之確定　及繳稅貨物之選擇、對於工業可能發生若何影響、似亦未加以相當考慮、往往對於同一物品、於其製造各期内迭次課稅、於是爲避免重複徵稅起見、不得不有關於退還稅欵之繁雜規定、通常任何賦稅之實施、須注意此項賦稅之範圍及可能發生之影響、而於賦稅重疊之避免、亦當加以注意、他如關於繳稅物品之避擇、稅率之是否適度行政組織之是否有效、與是否合乎經濟、行政方法之是否適於工業之特殊狀况等等皆應加以研究、本委員會業已提出之水泥特别消費稅法·及火柴特别消費稅法草案對於上述賦稅要件、深信尚無不合之處、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c84">海員增薪運動 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>六外商輪之表示</p>
<p>計决進行三辦法</p>
<p>近日海員因增薪問題、向外商輪太古怡和等公司提出交涉、迄未解决、此事已迭誌本報、查此事有前因後果、海員要求理由極爲正大、記者昨特往訪海員工業聯合會滬分會常委唐和生等、叩詢此事之進行狀况、承詳述經過與現在之步趨、亟爲分誌如後、</p>
<p>增薪之動機　海員要求增加工薪、尚在去年春間所提議、係指江海各輪内之生火、水手及管事等三部分職工之工薪、請予酌加、誠以海員工資、本甚微薄、且巳有十年未曾增加、當民十之時、海員公會在香港曾與英商船東提出增薪要求一次、彼時訂定海員工薪、每隔三年、應增加一次、顧時逾十稔、而船東迄未履行此約、去春各海員請求加薪條件、擬定之後、因討逆軍事、正在進行、深恐爲反動者搗亂、有妨時局、故將此案忍痛中止、至本年以生活程度激漲、海員受此環境壓迫、不得不向各輪公司提出要求也、</p>
<p>華輪先允加　今年海員公會提出增薪要求後、由滬航會虞洽卿·陳伯剛·陳幹靑·等各會員、邀集海員代表、並各華輪公司代表開會討論、議定將前給之米貼取消、各海員每人增加工薪六元、本年八月份起、先加四元、至明年三月份起、再加二元、當時海員亦表示同意、即由航業公會分告華商在會各輪公司、一律照議定增薪案實行、</p>
<p>六外輪交涉　本埠洋商輪公司之行駛江海航路、而雇用華海員者、有英商太古·怡和·亞細亞·美商捷江·美孚·日商日清等六家、船舶輪華商公司爲多、自海員公會提出增薪條件時、對六外輪公司亦爲同樣之要求、迨華輪允增、而六外商輪仍無表示、因其不入航會、故海員公會、祗得單獨向各該公司交涉、其中日清·美孚·亞細亞·捷江·等、均諉稱如太古怡和允加、則各該輪亦援案增給、</p>
<p>洋商之表示　英商太古公司接到海員公會之要求條件後、曾與公會代表幾度談判、先欲請滬航會會員出任調停、以其並未入會、未便進行、遂由公會直接交涉、磋商多次、結果太古公司、祗允將六月份自動所加之二元米貼取消、每人各加工薪三元、而海員方面、照華輪所允之增額、亦須加六元、今祗允半數、則與所提出之數目、相差太巨、而交涉乃未有結果也、</p>
<p>進行之步趨　昨日海員公會、本定上午九時、開會討論、對付各洋商輪之增薪、要求方法、以會員未能到齊、故大會未能開成、現在公會内巳經議定進行辦法兩項、（一）分派代表再向六外輪公司接洽要求、（甲）先增工薪六元、（乙）以後每隔五年、須增加工薪一次、（二）由海員公會詳述交涉經過、及各外輪之對加薪事之堅執固拒情况、呈請中央黨部、轉請政府速予援助、以促外商船東之速予履行增薪條件、使此案早日解决、（三）至談判决裂萬不得巳之時、祗得實行最後之對付辦法、但苟有妥協希望、决不願採取决裂手叚也、</p>

<p>事實告訴我們種鴉片的肥料、比種普通農作物來得消耗因爲牠的吸收量很大的緣故　農民大多數是很經濟的他們對於施用肥料那襄肯儘量供給鴉片的需要結果、種鴉片的用地、原有的滋養力、無形中漸漸地被他吸收去了、就是俗語所說的「拔地力」、肥沃之田漸漸變爲瘠弱而無力所以種鴉片一年改種其他農作物他的生産量便和不曾種過鴉片的田地自然减少結果　連續種了幾年鴉片的田地自然减少結果連續種了過人工肥料的一般改種農作物那裏會生長收成呢、這是種鴉片對於土壞變壞的關係甘肅陜西等省分爲了交通的不便不能把笨重的木料運輸到外洋轉賣、因此便種了鴉片因爲鴉片的體積小值價貴比木料輕便得多、當局爲了調劑全省的金融不便嚴厲禁止　鴉片但是我們想甘肅交通不便笨的木料果然没法運得出笨</p>

<p>人才輩出　注重練習</p>
<p>我國網球國手邱飛海君、游歐在即、茲將其觀測所及、特著「中國網球前途」一文、在本報發表茲錄於後、自民十六舉行第八届遠東運動會以來、中國草地網球、業有猛速之進步、目下在各大學及業餘運動界中、已成爲最風行之一種、網球會之後先成立、迄今數已不尠、而每次球賽中、觀衆之盛、尤足見國人對此運動之熱心、中華全國體育協進曾、更每歲組織各種比賽、提倡鼓勵、不遺餘力、觀於近年進步之速率、諒中國行將不難他與人角逐於網球世界中也、</p>
<p>日前吾國正有許多極有希望之靑年球員、如約翰之鄭兆佳滬江之余田光、以及鄙人在歷次比時所見之無數健將、在最近之將來、皆可在網球界中、卓然自見、爲國爭光、若輩皆具有奪取錦標之潛伏能力、所需者經騐耳、此可藉多事比賽、多與球藝勝我者角逐面得之、此項球賽、須於年幼時練起、而初學者尤當注意握法·立法·與抽球法之準確、宜先請名家指導、或多閱世界網球聖手鐵爾登之著作、然後從事、苟於此三者、毫無門徑、幸勿輕於嘗試、困一入歧途、將難自反、日後能校正者、十不獲一、若開始時即能循正確姿勢、再加以無間之練習、將來必能成爲良好之球手、惟欲超　軼倫、則尚須視乎天才之奚若、因網球非僅抽打而己、必有軟手膽量·忍耐·體力·與策略之四端、</p>
<p>日本網球今已卓越遠東諸國、堪與世界能手相匹敵、而其所以能致此地位者、固大半由於國人之誘掖奬　、對於靑年球員、予以種種便利、如各大學及其他運動中心地、皆有良好之網球場、此於球藝之進步上、裨益不淺、因若常侷蹐於惡劣之球場中、將致抽球上及時間之估測上、造成不良習　、此外、則其體育團體鼓勵各球會間之比賽、與選派球隊赴海外觀光、及邀請世界名手、到日表演、以資觀摩等、皆所以謀球藝之猛晋者也、</p>
<p>中國網球現尚在幼穉時代、但觀於近來奇突之進步、與中華體育協進會鼓勵球賽之努力、諒將來定將産生奪取世界網球錦標之第一流人才也、</p>

<p>昨以三比一勝利德余田光爲網球界中新進之好手而公認爲我國未來之俊傑者、此次自參加上海草地網球單打乙組賽以來、每戰必克、無役不勝、昨日下午二時在法商總會、與利德互奪錦標少年英雄、名不虚傳、血單四盤彼老練善戰之利德、竟而棄兵曳甲、拜倒於網拍之下南面而稱臣矣、</p>

<p>利德之勝第一盤、多得力於攔網、余田光經騐不足、以致束手舞策、雖努力追隨、卒因相離過鉅、遂遭敗挫、第二盤雙方掙札甚力、初利德扶搖直上、爲勢峻急、嗣余氏鼓氣銳進、乃見轉危爲安、獲得勝利、余氏以戰勝之餘威、横掃千軍、乘勢而奪得第三盤之勝利、第四盤彼此並進、不相上下、四四之後余氏方高占優勢、未幾以五比四領前、最後一局、又賴二下兇惡之供球、完成單打錦標之大功、觀衆歡呼騰笑之聲、溢滿空中、以祝其前途之努力矣、</p>

<p>昨邱飛海對俵氏未畢｜俵氏二對一佔先</p>
<p>第一盤變化莫測劇戰聲中、邱氏開始迎擊、形勢不利、滿地荆　、連失三局、如　眼一　、爲時未幾也、乃改換策略、屢忽近忽遠之擊法亂人視綫、第四局遂攫爲已有、顧俵氏勁力十足、正擊反抽、爲勢而進、邱氏堅固陣綫又爲之動搖、連敗二局、而成一比五之落後、遙望前途令人心驚胆裂不堪設想、乃時會突轉、形勢忽變、邱氏生平技能、至時方盡量發展、先以變化不測之手叚、擾亂敵方軍心、然後乘隙直攻、轉輾獲利、奮回第七届、取得第八局、未幾一鼓而下第九局、俵氏愡形慌忙、第十局又人邱氏之手、雙方局數各五、相抗不下而觀衆情緒、爲之緊張、第十一局掙扎之甚、前所罕見、殺得中日英面紅筯赤、氣喘不止、平衡之數、先後六見、累得邱氏疲乏不堪、俵氏乃乘機進占、是局結果、轉落其手、第十二局俵氏依然稱强、一鼓而下、俵氏乃以七比五勝第一盤是盤上下變化、令人莫測、印氏之重大打擊即在最初三局之損失、而千鈞一髮之第十一局、又以身力不濟勝而復敗、故終致功虧一簣也</p>
<h3 id="c157">第二盤功敗垂成 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>邱飛海於第二盤中、確有精彩之表演、博得觀衆之贊賞、開始互相並進、不分彼此二二之後、邱氏動如脫兎靜如處女、扶搖直上、以五比二占勢、乃俵氏具驚人之技、反連勝五局致邱飛海有功敗垂成之嘆矣、第一局邱氏以滑四全勝第二局歸諸俵氏　第三第四兩局又名得其一、第五局起、邱氏生龍活虎無論正反、均先人一著、第六局中、益見神妙俵氏完全失其抵抗能力、受其網拍之指揮、第七局邱氏三番四次死裡逃生、而得勝利之結果、造成五比二之優勢、嗣得俵氏銳氣頓盛、正擊之猛、如挾千軍萬馬難以抵禦遂騰第八局、第九局邱氏　逢　遇可以完成一盤之大功　見事與心違又落敵人手中其最大原因、厥爲膂力之不如人也、俵氏於絕望之下、得漸入佳境、宜其精神百倍、一氣而呵成最後之三局又以七比五勝第二盤矣、</p>
<h3 id="c158">第三盤最後努力 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>第三盤之前十二局、勝利之歸、咸屬於供球之一人、邱氏供球雖弱、然頗有曲折、敵人畢次猛進、反見中計、是盤關係重大、俵氏勝則　標定、邱氏勝則轉機生、故同在疲乏狀態之下、依然努力作戰、不敢放鬆一步也、邱氏以首先供球之便利、每占先署、而俵氏如影　形、不即不離、於是而有一一·二二·三三·而至六六平數之發見、最後二局、邱氏始終以柔功對付、俵氏則心火堤起、出手失其把握、邱氏遂以八比六勝第三盤、而得有今日繼續比賽之機會、</p>

<p>邱飛海與俵氏之戰法如出一派　二人同竚立底綫左右環擊、攔　之　、往此　不一見、正擊均有勁道、而俵氏稍見力猛、反抽各無一失、而邱氏較有變化、此外俵氏以　力見長而邱氏以策略擅勝、至火氣方面、邱氏固已完全　　、而俵氏則不免有時而犯也、今日下午繼續比賽時、邱氏如能於　急扯球之後趨前　　、對方或有顧此失彼之患也、</p>

<p>上海人常有一窩風的特性。無論什麽玩意兒。祗要新鮮有趣。一經傳說。便大家趨之若騖。馬戲·蟹背美人都成爲過去了。現在最轟動一時的便是衛樂園的脚踏車比賽。素來寂寞的海格路。一變而爲車水馬龍了。上星期我和朋友們也去觀光了一次。覺得有幾點狠有一記的價值。</p>
<p>跑道的奇特　普通田徑賽的跑道是平坦的。而衛樂園的跑道却是斜的。斜度不一。有些四十五度。有些陡削的地方。竟至七十度光景。一律用細木板砌成的。光滑異常。眞是别開生面。</p>
<p>發起人殉技　據說。發起創辦衛樂園的是位荷蘭人。　他能在高斜度的跑道上行駛極快的機器脚踏車。可是一次他在試騐他的技術時候。因爲速度過高。竟身不由主的直衝上去。從三丈多高的地方跌下來。一命嗚呼了。</p>
<p>公正人撞傷　那天有一個日本人。一個中國人。一個安南人比賽機器脚踏車。最後一圈。大家拚命的開快車。日本人看看追出安南人了。不知怎樣一個不當心。機車直滾而下。可巧撞着了一位日本公正人。頓時那人便臉色蒼白。倒地不能言語。而乘車的人。也傷了。</p>
<p>險哉被碾碎　這種賽車的確再危險没有了。到了驚心駭目的時候。大家眞要代揑一把汗。一次。三個西洋人比機器車。不知怎樣。車忽離身而去。人跌在跑道上。趁勢還摔出幾丈路。連忙爬下。可巧後面一輛車子風馳電掣而來。祇消他遲一秒鐘。離開跑道。便要被碾着。是多麽險呀。然而這位西洋人。雖然跌傷。依然還起來駕車繞跑了一圈。壯士精神。畢竟可佩。觀衆報了一個滿堂彩。</p>
<p>身體特别胖　演員身體多狠胖。後來一探聽原來是防備跌傷。所以衣裳裏面。放了些軟質物。頭部也有東西保護着。所以覺得分外　腫了。五點鐘。方纔完畢。</p>

<p>— 看雲樓主</p>
<p>余幼時嘗觀徽班戲。無所謂壓軸大軸也。無所謂正角配角也。亦無所謂頭牌二牌觔斗虎跑龍套也。（跑龍套雖有此名詞。但好角兒亦常承乏。）而京班則界限分清。身分懸殊。至今日尤甚。梅楊合作。余楊合作。終不能持久。梅余合演。除堂會外。决不能見。甚至二路老生。巳不願爲旦角附庸。而二路旦角。亦不願作老生之隨員。故近年平角南游。不能携相當配角。往往失敗以去。賢如叔岩。其探母刺湯等劇。猶不賣座。因顧曲者有半面可聽之歎也。</p>
<p>程艶秋歷游海上。俱獲良好成績。程腔二字。已足與譚調並垂不朽。然今之唱程腔者。僅歌駡殿金鎖記等數齣。未見有摹其武家坡汾河灣桑園會御碑亭寶蓮燈者。不知艶秋於此數劇。俱有精密研究。但駡殿金鎖爲靑衣獨脚戲。聽者自然悅服。汾河桑園諸齣。生旦並重。艶秋曩昔出演。老生未稱。好處都爲掩没。於是談程腔者。僅知有駡殿金鎖文姬歸漢矣。</p>
<p>艶秋嘗與叔岩合演探母刺湯於共舞台。上座之盛。得未曾有。可見搭配得當。無論何戲均能引人入勝。艶秋叔岩。在伶界中。均有創造。地位相埒。而二人吃調。亦復合式。閒嘗自思。艶秋叔岩若能長久合作。必能提倡許多舊戲。惟在事實上。决不能實現。今叔岩多病。已久不登塲。愛余調者。惟王少樓是趨。已久不登塲。愛足。年少才美。唱作摹仿叔岩。能得其神。此次隨艶秋南下。不僅瓊林宴失街亭定軍山南陽關諸戲。足使滬人過癮。即武家坡汾河灣寶蓮燈御碑亭等。亦可爲艶秋增加精彩。程余合作。此願終虚。得少樓爲配。己滿人意。牡丹綠葉。相得益彰。吾深爲艶秋慶得人。而桑園汾河諸劇。從此風靡天下。尤舊劇復興之好現象也。</p>

<p>— 百圭</p>
<p>秋高氣爽。蟹肥花黄。正持螯對酒時也。南京路瓣世界點景應時。而有蟹背美人之陳列供人觀賞。大飽眼福。使海上人士。見所未見者。今得而見之。　是何等快樂事。獨惜蟹美人。體質過小。雖生成姣好面貌而觀者糢糊不明瞭。殊有掩美之歎。若能罩以顯微鏡。而放大之則廬山眞面。盡在眼底矣。</p>
<p>夫寰球之大。無奇不有。豈僅揭揚一美人蟹乎。愚見蟹之異者凡二。一。在衡州東鄉有蟹大如面盆。每當天雨之際。横行隴畝間。遍身毛髭茸茸。背呈綠色。天晴不見。初鄉人有捕之者。其手輒爲髭毛所刺。痛如刀割。必釋之而痛止。故尊之曰神蟹據父老談。謂聞先人傳述。此蟹生命巳歷五百餘年。閱盡滄桑。今已無人敢捕云云。民十五年。革命軍北伐。某部兵士。駐紮東鄉。見蟹。以剌刀殺之。烹調而食。其味絕鮮。爲常蟹所不及。噫。五百年之老蟹。竟斵喪於軍人之手。何不幸耶。一在蘇州郊野。偕友人徐子步遊。綠草動處。一蟹横行而出。初以爲常蟹也。　繼見其行動時。而足向上伸張。緊抱腰際。徐子笑曰。此跳舞蟹也。是蟹頭部。長有寸許之角。其角現黄白黑紅四色。燦然奪目。愚欲捕之歸。以供賞玩。徐子素迷信謂物旣具特異之姿。必有神靈之附。遂不果。上述二蟹與新世界陳列之美人蟹。可謂蟹類三怪矣。</p>
<p>昔某巨公有蟹食譜叙烹蟹之法凡四十六種。惜愚健忘。設能記其詳者。而筆之於此。必爲老饕所欲聞也。惟記其中之一段以蟹黄煑白菜。而滲鷄湯。其昧濃而清鮮云。</p>

<p>— 天虚我生編</p>
<p>秋風一起，凡人皮膚即感枯燥，大抵都由貧血所致，皮膚　缺乏脂肪滋養，可用牛乳和硼酸甘油搽之甚效，惟牛乳極易酸敗，不如用無敵牌蝶霜爲便，因蝶霜係乳酷製成，不含碱性，能吸收空氣中之滋養料以潤皮膚，故能免除皸裂并止痛癢，頗有良效，至於内服補血之劑，則以無敵牌之葡萄汁或葡萄酒爲最宜，</p>
<p>婦女及小兒之皮膚，極爲嬌嫰，易爲風日所侵害，故嘗數粉資保護，譬諸房屋之用油漆，牆垣之用粉飾，必較不油漆與不粉飾者能耐久而常新，亦　保護内容弱質，藉增外表觀　，而便洗滌塵垢，抵抗風日，其法固甚美善。惟古時面粉，乃燒鉛錫而成，鉛有三種，一白鉛，譯名爲鋅，二曰蒼鉛。譯名爲鉍，三曰黑鉛，直譯爲鉛，三者之中，黑鉛最賤，易受酸化，製成鉛粉，遇磁變黑，故有害於皮膚，西洋面粉，都用鋅白，東洋面粉，則用蒼鉛，試以硫酸，即易辩識，不變色者，即無害於皮膚，無敵牌之藍盒粉，即爲鋅白，黄盒粉則加以鉍，細膩熨貼，勝於鉛粉，則由配合得宜，故其優點，足與東西洋之面粉媲美，洵爲皮膚保護劑中之良品，其用法，宜先敷蝶霜，然後撲粉，則不脫不粘，逈與凡脂俗粉，不可同日語也，</p>
<p>西洋輸人之懷中鏡盒粉，一經用罄，往往無從添配，可以郵寄上海國貨路家庭工業社，托爲配，但附郵票三角可矣，若其尺寸爲對徑二英寸者，則該社已有現成製就者發行，名爲「無敵牌配粉」祗售二角，各處百貨商店均有售，外有鋁製小盒，并附綢撲，亦可直接使用，惟如移配於鏡盒中時，當將粉盤取出，其空盒尚可作别用也，</p>

<p>— 趙光祖</p>
<p>招商局爲先君治喪。光祖等將隨吾母吾叔父扶柩歸葬於四川先壟之次。因從革諸命先輩問先君行誼而泣述之。曰。先　年十餘。與先姑丈黄鹿生楊莘友兩先生。號永寗三傑。憤清政不網。謀所以段覆之。永寗在萬山中。四川多盜。永寗嘯聚尤衆。三人往來山中。交其渠率。民國紀元前五年。熊帆錦黄復生兩先生。奉同盟會孫總理之命規四川。於是莘友姑丈自日本學警察。歸。先君自成都叙瀘中學轉自流井樹人學校。亦歸。與鹿生姑丈。皆已入同盟會。熊黄已識莘友姑丈。因與共訪鹿生姑丈。而俱來金鵝池會先君。密語連日。欲以永寗首事。永密哥　會兩派不相下。設靑年會　解之。曉以革命。山中軍皆樂聞。時楊滄白先生主講永寗中學。以化學藥品供復生先生製炸彈。藥爆發。復生先生傷手及目。事頗洩。縣令傳語曰。「速走百里外。不爾。捕且至。」九月九日先君與同黨十餘人。登高山。入深林。殺牛煮酒。拔劍擊地。歌呼竟日。乃行。</p>
<p>至瀘洲。以川東南多黨人。欲據江安。通永寗。引山中軍出。會攻瀘州而東下重慶。决以九月三十日襲江安。先君轉旁縣。與上江黨人會　爲鐵山。推先君與程德藩先生任江安指揮。九月二十七日。先君從鐵山挾炸彈十枚。過宜賓。取軍用票及黨旗趣入江安城。至。則下令。以夜十二時於東門内舉火。眞武山巡防數百人攻東門。綠林千餘人攻西門。夜半。火光燭天。槍聲旬然起郭外。市中囂。先君與程先生居旅店。草文告。料簡炸彈。以爲城且下。欲武裝趣出。吏卒游　　至。二人度事且敗。則堅握彈踞坐床上。窺吏卒果入者。即擲彈與俱斃。吏卒叩室門。則從容應曰。「我—學生—火熄否。何來槍聲。」卒曰。「火且熄無恐。匪刼城耳」。不虞爲黨人指揮攻城者。搜旁舍以去。質明。我軍敗。趣出城。至瀘州。進食。夜奔隆昌。匿天樂山炭坑中十餘日。歸永寗。</p>

<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（二）途中</p>
<p>我倆談了許多閒話。他們三位都孰睡了。探窗看看空際。只見滿天的星斗。兀自不息在上面閃動。撞撞仄仄的車聲。在極靜的境界裏奏那單調的音樂。時候很易過。不覺巳經天亮了。到了Ｓ車站我們就下車吃些咖啡麵包。從此一路過去。都是很好的山景。到中午時分便達亞納西湖ＬacdAnnecy蒲爾越湖ＬacBourge這兒就是一百年前法國詩人拉馬丁Lamartine在此做「湖上」一詩而談戀愛的故處。沿途靑翠秀麗的岡巒漸漸變成崇山峻嶺。滾滾的急流。不斷地奔騰。那時走了多少路。我可不記得了。雲的形狀。太陽的光線。氣候的温度。以及一切事物都漸漸變遷了。從Meana以束。我們的火車是在巍峨絕谷中盤旋。這就是阿爾卑斯山的最高峯。數百里皚皚的雪峯。氣勢千萬。一直插入雲端。這是世界有名的白峯MontBlanc了。白峯多美的字面。多大的地名。白得高得好。白。眞是不染一塵。高。高得有意思。雲外有峯。峯上還有峯。我的心眞是艶羡它的白和高。（白峯高四千八百十米突。合一萬尺。）雖然也有旖　的雲貌去掩蔽。纒繞。狂風去侵凌。不過它所享受的空氣畢竟是不同的。它終是那樣白和高。它這種崇高的絕妙的境地。完全天生的。眞無可如何它。你只有仰眺而巳。可是只我一個在窗外仰眺着。片刻也不能放過。如有機會。使我住在這絕谷中好好地盡一回。我或者能夠産生夠豐宫和美滿的作品。我眞是如此想。我游過泰山。華山。還有衡山。也到底不及這幾百里白峯插雲的巍峨。開朗的光景。當時拿破崙領着軍隊。踏了這白峯而入意大利的神氣。他那偉大的足跡還可以使人推想而吃驚的。</p>

<p>— 楊紹志</p>
<p>開展文藝社編輯</p>
<p>從本年六月一日、民族主義文藝運動者集會於上海、發表了宣言後、在文藝界中就起了一個怒吼的呼喊、在舊文藝没落了、新文藝也没落了的現時代裏、好像産生了一枝救命的生力軍、挽救垂死的文藝界的危機、和開拓文藝界的進路、在上涨就誕生了他們的代表刊物、即就是前鋒周報該報到此刻已出版到第十七期、内容的豐富、理論的充實、已有許多人替它作過介紹了、自然用不着我再來麻煩、固然它是一個容量很少的刊物、然而巳夠發生力量了、此後接着上海幹得最努力的民族主義的文藝運動、自然要算南京的一部份、這是没有什麽希罕的、要曉得南京是江南文人薈集的所在、何况南京又是我們大中華民國的首都、所以南京的文藝界也就因着交通的便利、以及富於愛好文藝的性情的緣故、因之也就易於接受新興的文藝運動、醒覺到在中國的現狀中、而所需要的文藝、纔能挽救目下中國文藝没落的狀態、於是乎、在南京的文藝界中、立刻有許多民族主義的文藝團體如雨後春笋般的産生、而民族主義文藝的刊物也如蓓蕾船的怒放着、</p>
<p>「開展」就是這樣的一個時代的刊物、到最近已出版到第二期了、在第二期中、有五個創作、其中四個是小說、一個是劇本、此外有翻譯的小說一篇、論民衆戲劇的文字一篇、還有一篇是談「山東歌謠中所表現的民族意識一的、</p>
<p>旣負着民族主義文藝刊物的招牌、論理在每篇的創作中、自然就應當處處都顯露出是民族的、民族主義文藝運動者在前鋒周報創刊號上曾經告訴我們、民族主義文藝的特質是「民族主義文藝是有力的、有希望的、是有光明的、是有意志的、是有精神的、要唤起民族的意識、要激勵民族的生氣、團結起來、一致地爲民族而奮鬥」然而在「開展」上、我們很少能找到這種的特質、不得不呌我們在歡迎中得到些微的失望、這固然是我們的責之太苛、實在亦即是可說是我們愛之心太切之故、希望「開展」編者能原諒我的吹毛求疵、同時我亦希望「開展」的編者多多地注意到這一層、顯明地流露出我們的中心意識、加緊地負起喚醒民族意識的責任、</p>
<p>「山東歌謠中所表現的民族意識」一篇是婁子匡讀顧綺仲編「山東瞅謠集」的感想、就從其中把關於特有的民族意識的表現的幾則　集起來、就成了本文、民間歌謠、本來是民族的、再加上一些爲民族的意識進去、自然更成了民族主義文字、山東民衆的痛苦、有悠久的時間受着軍閥的蹂躪、而且時常又會遭遇赤白帝國主義者的頻臨茶毒、在蹂躪之下、自然要爲爲自己的生存而挣扎、在壓迫之下、自然也要爲自己的生存而發出沉痛的呻吟、於是乎在他們的歌謠中、也就儘量流露出要打倒帝國主義者和撲滅殘餘軍閥的呼喊、其中着實有幾則、我認爲是很可觀的、就讓我把關於打倒帝國主義者和撲滅軍閥的都介紹出一篇來吧、</p>
<p>（一）關於仇恨帝國主義者歌謠</p>
<p>勸同胞、</p>
<p>要記牢、</p>
<p>五三三慘案事非小、</p>
<p>對日經濟絕交、</p>
<p>千古莫忘了、—山東章邱</p>
<p>（二）關於撲滅殘餘軍閥的歌謠、</p>
<p>一二三四五、</p>
<p>打到濟南府、</p>
<p>先殺張宗昌、</p>
<p>後殺褚玉璞、</p>
<p>先有義和團、</p>
<p>後有紅燈罩、</p>
<p>碰了電綫杆、</p>
<p>殺了張宗昌、</p>
<p>才醒太平覺、|山東寗陽</p>
<p>總之、這種歌謠、我覺得是值得介紹的、我更希望各地部能把這一類的歌謠儘量地記下而宣揚出來、</p>
<p>華僑在外國所國受的侮辱、這自然都是我們中華民族老大無能的結果、這種所遭受侮辱的情形、實在幾等於在無理性的蠻人所盤據的苗窟中所遭遇的痛苦相彷彿、假使把它完完全全詳詳細細地紀錄出來、恐怕眞會氣煞人吧、「回國」的一篇、就是描寫着華僑中所遭受着侮辱的一幕吧了、「污穢的黄色」的雅稱、我們能夠接受下來嗎、朋友們、時候到了、燃燒起我們的民族情緒、加入正當光明的組織、來共同爲民族而努力吧、</p>
<p>舊社會中名敎的觀念、不知道葬送了多少有爲的靑年男女、「風信之死」的一個劇本、就是一個有爲的靑年、活活地被社會排擠得不容其生存、他就在名敎之下犧牲了的一個事實、無法維持生活的孀婦孤兒、同時她得到了一個男人、維持她們的生活、竟有三年　日的精神、她顧到她自己的生活和幸福、她又顧到孤兒的前途、她就再醮了、這種行動是值得咀咒的嗎、她覺悟了、她就大胆地冒天下的不大韙、幹出這椿人所不出的事、然而事實更不料是會這樣的、我要咀咒舊社會的毒狠、舊社會太不予人以生路了、因爲母親的再醮、竟然連這個孤兒也連帶着永遠地被社會所蔑視、不時地被社會用要惡辣的手叚所排擠、弄得他就在舊社會中犧牲了、禮敎的桔桎、太束縛人已甚了、我們願做彼征服的綿羊、我們還是願做名敎中的罪人、醒覺的靑年們喲、來努力地打破名敎的堅壁、拯救有爲的同胞呵、</p>
<p>還有「民衆戲劇漫談」一篇、是值得一讀的、其餘的幾篇、不免仍帶着浪漫頽廢的氣味、假使把這幾篇拿到文學的刊物上去登載、或許是值得鑒賞的、在民族主義文藝的刊物中、似乎是不應該有它的地位、</p>
<p>總之、「開展」在這已出版的兩期中、固然還不多充實的理論、好熱烈的有力的創作、不過、至少他們是已經認識了光明的途徑、將來的成功、自然也是可以預料的、願園丁們勇敢地仔細地努力吧、共同來培植這新拓的園地、灌溉這含苞未放的蓓蕾、以求豐富美滿的收獲、</p>
<h3 id="c207">點綴 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 文華</p>
<p>拂荷作</p>
<p>本來、在我們這遍體瘡痍的老大中國、舊社會的毒菌是根深蒂固的陷在人們頑固的心坎中的、尤其是在那些窮鄉僻隅的去處、因了交通不便或是種種關係、雖然現下是所謂「二十世紀的時代、却仍死死的保持着遺老遺少底十足皮桶氣的習尚、在他們的四周、像是有一座萬難打破的鐵墻、而很少接受現時代的文化、就即有所輸入、也會被舊社會的惡菌所障礙而遭了消化不良的結果、在名義上、中國已經是受過革命洗禮了的國家、至少那些腐舊的惡勢力應該被滅除、但是、我們試來平心靜氣地考察一下、事實正會呌我們大失所望、正如本書作者所描寫的幾句俏皮的諷刺話一般無二、</p>
<p>「…關帝廟……墻壁上各處貼滿了破碎零落的花紙標語、留下三月前所謂民衆大會（！）的㾗跡、頽敗的神權時代的遺物、彷彿穿上了一件五光十色的時髦衣裳、」</p>
<p>事實上、在這些地方、革命也者、只是一套換湯不換藥的擺戲而已、一些舊有的七品小京官和清朝遺退下來的皮桶們、或是一披新出的張牙利爪的狗頭、只消替自己爛臭的身子裏上了一件革命（！）的外套、即一登龍門、身價十倍、乃狐假虎威、魚肉人民、所謂是公的盜賊、這名兒實在恰當、在他們的脅下更有一些士和劣走役、舊禮敎也全靠這披人來維持、乃得公然存留於世、一旦倘有一二有血性的靑年出來給他們稍微作對一下、他們便大可可毫用不着思索、給你加上了一個比犯王法還要神通的「叛徒」即可無所忌憚地任其所爲了、這在他們是一會常用的老套、在這個電網似的淫威之下、不知道有幾許靑年犧牲了呢、</p>
<p>本來是一些士匪、因爲現在是革命了、只須背上三角帶、也化身一變而爲靑天白日旗幟之下的革命人物、也就公然行其故技、種種種種、花樣委實多端、</p>
<p>這種社會實在是容不得好人的、一般有血性的靑年眞是要窒死、非但戀愛不得自由、即是些微的反舊言論或行動、都得當心自己的腦袋、在這重低氣壓之下、靑年的心靈實在大苦鬱了、本書作者便是此中苦過來鬱過來的人、他的被創傷過了的靈魂已血㾗斑駁地攤在我們的面前了、這是我們應該感謝他的、他代我們這些心靈的苦鬱者抉開了一條欲吐無從的心河、將狗頭社會的罪狀很胆敢地宣布了出來、這是多麽痛快、</p>
<p>怯弱、似乎是我們中華民族的劣根性、尤其是現下的靑年們遇事總是得過且過、不敢反抗、只甘屈服、因此生活的兩面是不能統一、心理上無時不在矛盾、明知環境之不合理、而且在意識上覺得生存在這環境裏是實在令人難耐了、常　對不滿的現實懷恨詛咒、同時在理想上生長了一個新的社會、它與目前的完全不一樣、對於理想的社會愈留戀、使他愈厭惡現實、覺得周遭盡是些殘惡、虚僞、欺騙的生物、於是想起來爲可憐的同類和現實鬥爭、覺得自身是無上的神聖、但是、儘你是多麽美麗的想頭、禁不了幾次現實所給與的挖苦、就會懷疑起來、灰色起來、終於使他胆怯、在方便中、也會和現實妥協、結果、永生陷在苦悶中、良心永久在重重的責備、從前所决意要滅除它的現實仍在周遭使威、認爲最神聖的理想社會變成了幻覺、萬事都推之於命運、盡至還會厭惡起先前所崇拜的理想宫、永久潦倒、沉湎、以至於死、</p>
<p>本書的主人翁王烈楓就是這一類人物的代表、眼看見自已的情敵是個没良心的野獸、殺王春生、燒三春軒的是他、把自己所犯的罪案放在善良的農民頭上的是他、把這些善良潔白的農民懸在火爐上做紅燒人肉的是他、自己的愛人又正是這條野獸的未婚妻、更被他把自己寃枉地放上了一個共匪的罪名、先前是曾經堂皇的說過、「爲解放衆生之倒懸、不惜一人爲犧牲」的、却因了恐嚇而自欺地解釋說、「原不過是偶然的命運、所　配着的那麽一回事、未曾作過絲毫的　抗、致多是偷錢地向敵人惡視過幾眼、　巳恐自己過於孟浪、這是多麽可笑、多　矛盾、後來、愛人被他的如獸的未婚夫　過自己的身邊去梅嶺活埋、不上前去　救勇敢的愛人、跟他一同去死、刦還退　到弄子裏、只是恐懼地暈眩過去、到</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>來才喊一句、「到梅嶺去、世界於我還有什麽」、</p>
<p>這才是世上最可憐不過的人、旣巳不安於現實、又不敢絲毫加以反抗、索性是個睡眼朦朧的人呢、倒是情有可原、而這樣做個良心的反叛者、環境的奴隸、實才是一個不可恕的罪人、</p>
<p>作者在他的卷頭語上曾經說、</p>
<p>「寫這篇小東西、我的心境變了幾次、起先我同情我的主人翁王烈楓、可憐他追求光明的迷夢、慢慢地、我憎惡起他來了、於是我給他穿上了一件「陳屍」的衣服、讓他在寒風中逝去、那也可說是憎惡我自己、刑罪我灰色的自己、</p>
<p>是很顯明的、作者已經負上了這個責任、王烈楓的身上是穿着一件「陳屍」的衣服、在此作者已經替自已表白、在憎惡王烈楓和他自己、</p>
<p>不過、這「陳屍」的衣裳、我們不能不承認是一個不吉的東西、所以、我尚望作者和他自己在卷頭語的末尾喊的一樣、</p>
<p>「周遭的光明　、我的努力喲、</p>
<p>我重新上了我的前路了、我希望、一本書在藝術上的確是部分地成功了、我相信、作者是憑了他誠實的心寫下他的作品、裏面可以說没有一處霧出虚造得不像的事實、不過、布局是有一點缺陷、各節的情景不能緊凑、第一節是動的結局、正呌人竪起汗毛、第二節却以散漫的靜爲起首、似乎覺得有些弛鬆、未始不是美中之不足吧、</p>
<p>第一節起首一直到第十一頁、起初都被我當做作者是在叙述事實、到了第十一頁的中央驀然這樣、「他不能再想下去、…」的轉了過去、眞把我一時弄得莫明其妙、後來仔細一看、誰知上面都是　烈楓和她的愛人立在橋旁的回憶、這一種裝法、實在不很美麗、也是本書的一個小缺點、</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十）春的消息</p>
<p>「……朋友、塞北的堅氷有否融解、是否空際仍飛着雪片、……呵、江南巳着新春、淺草巳綠、桃瓣巳展、……朋友、我流浪的朋友、今折桃一小枚柳一小枝、從江南遞寄到遼遠的塞北、俾你可以在雪與氷的國度、得領受故園春的消息………」</p>
<p>呵、我將怎樣地感謝你寄給我春的消息啊、我的親愛的友人、</p>
<p>窗外參差的枯枝還留着積雪、空際又飄飄地飛下雪片、江上的封氷還堅凝着未解、……呵呵、這正是江南新春的時節啊、我沉思着、我想起江南的春來、那彎澄靜的小河、躺在嫩紅與新綠的中間、南風吹拂着岸邊的柳絲、點點着靜止的水面、姚花的殘瓣有時也嬌嬾地落下、於是魚兒們驚覺了、　出水面、以爲是獲得了餌食、爭逐着、終於喪氣地又攢進水深去、尾巴這們一甩、靜止的水濺了輕微的浪花、漾成漫游的旋渦、太陽從綠葉的背後偷窺着、笑了、</p>
<p>每當街頭巷尾聞着賣花女的嬌嫩而素朴的喊聲時、知道春已來了、我總要去看一看那小河、</p>
<p>但是、如今、我流浪到塞北、江南的友入苦訴我春的消息、然而、然而啊、塞北的雪野還鼓着冷風、那些姑娘們的香嫩的脖子還裹在皮領裏、我更到何處去看那小河呢、</p>
<p>「要六月才解得開松花江的氷呢、等松花江的氷解了、樹枝才看得見新綠、草野才漸漸發靑、外套才可以由我們的身上脫下—那時、恐怕江南春已殘了、」</p>
<p>「哦、」我疾恍地望着灰色的天、積雪的枯枝、和輕微的雪花的漫舞、「那時、那時江南春巳歸去了、桃花殘了、楊柳老了、小河的水也變了顔色了、那時、都市裏的姑娘們巳換了輕薄的紗裳了、—但是這裏正開始看綠葉從融雪中吐露出春息呢、」</p>
<p>—這是自然的奇蹟、</p>
<p>於是我將壓扁了的桃瓣與柳枝藏入書頁、繼續展讀江南友人的來信、</p>
<p>「……呵、朋友、這會引得你對於春的回憶……大概你總不會忘懷玄武湖的櫻花、龍華的桃花、和西湖的楊柳吧、即是一次我們散步時偶然遇着的那靜止的小河、想也會走入你的記憶、……」</p>

<p>|通訊|</p>
<p>嘉</p>
<p>前天給吾的信、已收到了、本想立刻覆你、可是今年功課眞忙、每天把吾關在圖書館、近來又要預備月考、忙得吾寫信給你的時間都没有了、想你又要像上次一樣、急得同熱鍋裏的螞蟻、一天到晚在門房裏亂走了吧、</p>
<p>吾們校内的一般男同學、專門歡　出幾個小錢、辦張壁報、把吾們女同學一切行動、都登了出來、害得吾像防賊一樣處處留心着、但是一不留心、又被他們知道了、眞使吾可恨、</p>
<p>這學期開學到現在、巳有三星期多了、一張壁報都没有、吾眞快樂極了、今天早上、吾上完了第一課後、走過子彬院、要回宿舍去、却看見素以消息靈通、組織完密見稱的「短波無線電」又出版了、預科學會主辦的「燦爛」、仍是板起了公正無私的面孔、同吾們相見了、同時又有張「犧聲」、是新出的、却不知誰辦的、内容眞很有趣、專門做東宫包探的阿枋、又做了篇「東宫春秋」登在那裏、開首這篇雖没有寫什麽事實、可是有個很可笑的誓言、吾把它抄下了、</p>
<p>南宿舍在前、</p>
<p>子彬院在後、</p>
<p>如何枋再寫東宫、</p>
<p>變猢猻關在四樓、</p>
<p>嘉、吾眞願他立刻就變個猢猻、關到四扈樓上、省得他再把吾們的事、寫出來給大家知道、再有篇呌「父與子」、却是奇怪的一篇東西、吾看了好久、不知他在說誰、吾猜想恐怕没有這種事實吧、一定是那具名「玉無㾗」的在爛嚼舌頭、現在吾也把它抄下給你看、你猜猜世上有這種險惡的人嗎、</p>
<p>「這是一個事實、確是有意味的事實、吾們並不以爲父子思想不一、爲人子者、就是大逆不道的、如果兒子思想較他父親更明貫、所謂後進者的思想、老老的爲人父得、要駡兒子大逆不道時、吾們是要帮助靑年來伸寃的、</p>
<p>可是萬一兒子思想走入岐途、好像給共産黨誘惑了、要和父親來打架、這是兒子根本錯誤、大好靑年遭了誘惑、那吾們要攻擊爲兒子的不正當呢、</p>
<p>本校中學部學生、像陳主任的口吻來讚美他一句「這是很能幹的的靑年呢」、所謂能幹的靑年、在陳主任眼光看來、也無非能爲他奔走吧了、在下很斷定他、當没有給搗亂派迷惑前、的確是一個腦子清爽者、他能做文章、會拍照、能夠爲大家張務、這樣的人材、老實說、共産黨見了、一定要設法收爲徒子徒孫的、於是想出方法來、先給以甜味的餌物、把條肥魚鈎上、好容易到手、又逃回去了、</p>
<p>這位同學……、他父親是國民軍裏的旅長、有姨太大七八人、據熊君說、這是許多姨太太、都是打勝仗後的凱旋品、他是唯一的兒子、在校裏用錢特别多、中山西菜社開了張、一請客就七八元、他請的以女同學爲多數、本學期又介紹了七八位女同學來復旦呢、</p>
<p>曾經做過同學會的主席、聽說是陳某運動出來的、辦過大事、另用錢多、當然陪女友尋快樂、又何曾想到、紅色革命呢、好肉到手、那肯放棄、於是普羅同志的毒計來了、第一步呌他寫信給父親、「以父子意見不合、還是脫離關係爲妙、「的話、做旅長的父親見小旅長被人誘感、唯一的傳宗子、也不肯任其亂動、就一個頭等電給兒子、大駡之餘、還附以「不然當停止匯錢」的驚句、的確口君太笨了、另用方面未曾想到呢、或許在下的忘記、在約普羅同志答應給他另用錢的、不過把戲做到這步、事還未了、要看普羅×同志的本領如何、可否敵得過堂堂旅長、</p>
<p>這是事實、下半段的事實、要打聽了再說、可是如果×同志秘密起來、那記者不能再談了、』</p>
<p>嘉、你看完了這篇東西、感覺得怎樣、倘使這是事實、</p>
<p>你要吾告訴你關於吾的生活情形、吾却告訴你這許多壁報事情、你高興看嗎、實在吾過着單調的學校生活、一些都没有可告訴你的事、只望你天天有信來、調劑吾的生活、</p>
<p>可是于還要告訴你件奇怪的中、就是中學部主任看到了那篇「父與子」却要求秘書長查辦那張壁報、至少要他們更正、現在曾歸訓育處辦理呢、</p>
<p>白天一則没有空時、二則恐怕又被同學們捉住胡鬧、因此等她們臥了、點了洋燭、偷偷的寫這封信給你、本來還有許多話要同你說、可是姊姊巳醒了、怕她噪得全房間的同學都知道、只好不寫了、好得星期六又要到了、吾仍在上次的公園裏等你、一同去看電影、</p>
<p>在此給你個甜吻、告别了、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang Cables National Government to Request Amnesty for Political Prisoners <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Excluding Yan Xishan and Chen Jiongming</p>
<p>Communists Granted Probation with Guarantee</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the National Government from the front, requesting measures to promulgate an order granting amnesty to political prisoners. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Urgent telegram to the Nanjing National Government, Greetings. Previously, on the eighth day of the eighth month, Zhongzheng telegraphed Your esteemed government, requesting to grant the officers and soldiers of Yan and Feng's troops an opportunity for self-renewal. Graciously accepted, a public announcement was issued. The central government's utmost benevolence and magnanimity is truly sufficient to promote harmony and quell rebellion. I believe that the nation relies solely on the military and the penal system to punish the wicked and eliminate violence. However, both should only be used as a last resort. Hence, there is a warning against unrelenting warfare, and a teaching of compassion in punishment. Since the completion of unification and the commencement of political tutelage, the central government has aimed to bring all the people of the nation onto the right track, jointly embarking on the path of peaceful construction. Unexpectedly, warlords who opportunistically engage in revolution still harbor the ambition of possessing troops and partitioning territories. All politicians, bureaucrats, traitors, and dregs, along with corrupt and degenerate elements, have found a basis for their actions and taken advantage of the situation. The central government has been forced to launch punitive expeditions and issue warrants for arrest, detention, or imprisonment. However, the intention behind discarding the old and initiating the new remains rooted in benevolence. Now that the punitive military operations are underway, the intention is to completely eliminate the rebellion. Rewards and punishments should be administered with kindness. If all can be renewed and treated leniently, those who hear of it may doubt that modern nations uphold the rule of law, and that those who deserve punishment should not be granted amnesty. However, it must be understood that our nation's circumstances differ from those of Europe and America. Subduing people with virtue is an ancient and evident teaching. Crimes of a political nature are inherently different from other crimes. Granting an opportunity for self-renewal is not a violation of the law. Issuing strict warrants would only serve as a tool for imperialists to exploit, providing them with a pretext for protection and reigniting chaos. To speak of the rule of law in such a case would be counterproductive. Moreover, I, Zhongzheng, am aware of my own limited virtue and lack of credibility. I often make mistakes in dealing with people and affairs. I am filled with self-reproach, how can I strictly demand perfection from others? Some may argue that with bandits rampant and rebellions frequent, strict laws and severe punishments are necessary to govern a chaotic nation. However, it must be understood that people do not fear death, but resent unjust punishments. To eradicate bandits, we must trace the root cause. To eliminate rebellion, we cannot rely solely on punishment. Now that the warlords have been thoroughly eliminated, all rebellious forces have lost their support. Who would not be moved by leniency towards their past transgressions? We should follow the legacy of universal love and uphold the grand scale of the nation. Why should we belittle ourselves and compare ourselves to a chaotic nation? I request that after the military situation is largely settled, or on January 1st of the twentieth year of the Republic, a special order be issued, granting amnesty to all political and military criminals, rescinding warrants, restoring their freedom, and allowing them to enjoy the rights of ordinary citizens. However, there are one or two individuals whose crimes are particularly heinous. For example, Chen Jiongming, who plotted against the Premier and even resorted to armed rebellion, has shown no remorse to this day. Yan Xishan is insidious and treacherous. Disregarding his crimes during the Chuo An Hui (筹安会) and the military governorship era, his various rebellions in the past two years since joining the revolution were all instigated by him, making him a treacherous element who deliberately destabilized the nation. These individuals should not be included in the amnesty. As for the Communist Party, their ideology is completely incompatible with our national principles. Moreover, their actions constitute banditry, including murder and arson, making them particularly ineligible for amnesty. However, if individuals within the Communist Party can repent and reform, with a reliable guarantor who can ensure that they will not repeat their past crimes, they may be granted a temporary reprieve. If they demonstrate no criminal behavior after three years, a definitive amnesty may be granted. What I have stated above is solely for the purpose of pacifying rebellion, stabilizing people's hearts, eradicating the source of chaos, and consolidating the foundation of the nation. If adopted and implemented, it will greatly benefit the progress of peace and unification. Chiang Kai-shek bows and impresses his seal. (A special telegram on the fourth day)</p>

<h3 id="e3">League of Nations Closes <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Before the League of Nations meeting this time, the world had already expected that it would not have much hope. Now that this session has closed, counting its achievements, they are indeed very few. The British Foreign Secretary, on his way back to England, said that although the League of Nations meeting was not as spectacular as last year's, it was quite interesting and also beneficial. The British Foreign Secretary had to say so, of course. However, if we carefully examine the course of the meeting, then what is called beneficial is also very minimal. The most important issue in the meeting, and what the world hoped for, was the preparation of the disarmament proposal. Now that its report and motion have been passed, because the representatives of Germany, Austria, and Hungary have not signed it, and the date for holding the general assembly has not been determined, it will have to wait until next year. Therefore, there is no way to talk about what its achievements will be. The amendment to the League of Nations Charter was generally considered to be related to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. If it could be amended, it would also be helpful in curbing wars. Now it is only under study by the shareholder committee. The intention of the Treaty on the Prevention of War is also to urge the implementation of the Pact of Paris. Now it has only been decided to form a special advisory committee to continue the review. In the case of the Protection of Minorities, although the debate was fierce during the discussion, what it called a solution was only to seek it in mutual trust and cooperation between the majority and the minority. Then its solution is still unresolved. Although it is said that most countries have expressed their approval for Briand's plan for a European Union, the result is still to delay it by organizing a committee for review. As for the so-called customs union related to this case, there is still no news of it. The above cases are all related to the future of peace. If we go further to examine its achievements, they are all in a distant and intangible state. I really don't see what benefits it has. Apart from this, if we must force ourselves to count its achievements, it is to pass a convention outside the meeting to provide financial assistance to the attacked countries. Within the meeting, it is to elect a few directors and decide on the outline for reorganizing the secretariat. However, this situation is not unexpected. Judging from the history of the League of Nations, and viewing it from the environment of various countries, it is appropriate that its achievements are limited to this.</p>

The Prince, leader of the radical right-wing Heimwehr, declared that the Heimwehr leaders' decision to join the Vaugoin cabinet was not to support Prime Minister Vaugoin but to seize political power.

Hours after the declaration was published, he slightly altered his words to avoid public anger. However, many believe that the initial declaration was the Heimwehr's true plan to establish a dictatorship if the election is unfavorable.

<p>To Receive Stipends and Living Expenses</p>
<p>London News: After the Governor-General of India and representatives of the British government published the list of sixty-six Indians invited to the Round Table Conference on Indian constitutional issues to be held in London at the end of this month, attention was focused on the fact that the list conspicuously lacked leaders from the All-India National Congress, the most powerful political party in India. The Indian authorities have repeatedly stated that the National Congress leaders have repeatedly refused to participate, so the responsibility lies not with the Indian government but with the National Congress. It is reported that the funding for the Round Table Conference has been agreed upon by the British government and the Indian government, each bearing half. The budget is based on the assumption that each representative will spend three months in England from the time they depart India (in other words, the authorities expect the conference to last at least three months). Each representative will receive a monthly stipend of £100 and an additional living allowance of 25 shillings per day while in London. The British representatives have not yet been announced, while the Indian government representatives will include one government minister, three secretaries, and several attendants. (World)</p>

Hugenberg's National People's Party stated that they were completely opposed to the current government and that the root of the current financial crisis lies in the issue of reparations payments, which the government's financial plan completely failed to address. The Communist Party has also published its financial plan, demanding the immediate cessation of reparations payments, the implementation of a 20% wealth tax, the setting of a maximum personal salary of no more than 8,000 marks per year, and a drastic reduction in military and police budgets. Within the Social Democratic Party, older leaders want to coordinate with the cabinet, while younger members advocate for vigorous opposition. They are still competing with each other.</p>

<p>Reuters, 4th, Paris Telegram: The Cabinet meeting has approved an order to curb the sale of discounted goods from Soviet Russia in France. All goods from Soviet Russia will be banned from import, and those that are allowed to be imported must have a license. The affected goods include grain, meat, eggs, sugar, and wood. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a communique stating that the prices of Soviet Russian goods are even lower than the cost in other countries, rendering the French government's efforts to protect domestic producers ineffective. The decline in prices is enough to cause huge losses. According to the Ministry of Commerce, the value of goods imported from Soviet Russia to France in the first six months of 1930 was over 441 million francs, while the value of goods exported from France to Soviet Russia was only 120 million francs.</p>

<p>Reuters, 3rd, Rome Telegram: Today, officials announced the news of the marriage of Italian Princess Giovanna, the third daughter of the Italian King, to Bulgarian King Boris. Rumors of this had been circulating for a long time, but because King Boris is a Greek Orthodox Christian, the Pope of Rome did not approve, causing an obstacle. However, a way has now been found to eliminate this difficulty. Boris is 36 years old and became King of Bulgaria in 1918 after his father Ferdinand abdicated. Giovanna is 23 years old.</p>

<p>Right Wing Occupies Weichuan and Weishi</p>
<p>Left Wing Occupies Xigong and Longmen</p>
<p>Hankou dispatch: After the general retreat of Feng’s army on the 22nd of last month, the Central Army immediately divided its forces to pursue. In the past few days, the right wing</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>Domestic News</p>
<p>has captured Tongxu, Chenliu, Weishi, Weichuan, Changchui and other places. On the left wing, they occupied Lushan, Yexian, Zhuge Street, Sima Street, Longmen Street and other places. The central route also completely occupied Xuchang on the 3rd. The recovery of Bian, Zheng, and Luo is not far off. The battle situation of each route is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Right Wing: The right wing of the Central Army is composed of the troops of Feng Yuxiang, Zhang Weixi, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, Liu Chunrong, Yue Xiangru, Ji Hongchang, and others. The two sides were in a stalemate between Weichuan, Weishi, Chenliu, and Tongxu, engaging in dozens of fierce battles. On the 30th of last month, Tan Daoyuan's division defeated the two troops of Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying and occupied the Sh窝 area between Qixian and Tongxu. On the 1st of this month, Luo's brigade of the division occupied Erlangzhuang, and Cheng's brigade occupied Sanligang. On the 2nd, they occupied Zhuxianzhen, and joined forces with the left wing of the Longhai Line to attack Kaifeng. Xu Yuanquan's division occupied Weishi on the 30th of last month, and Xia Douyin's division occupied Weichuan. Feng Yuxiang’s army Sun Lianzhong's troops were completely disarmed. Shangguan Yunxiang and Hao Mengling's two divisions also came out of Xinzheng on the side and attacked Zhengzhou. According to Xu Yuanquan's telegram on the 3rd, the various units have continued to advance from the east and west areas of Weishi, and Luguan, Xiema Camp and other places have been recovered, and a large number of weapons have been seized. Now a part of the army is approaching Zhengzhou and will be captured within a few days.</p>
<p>Left Wing: The 17th Route Army of Yang Hucheng on the left wing, since occupying Ziyou County, Yang Hucheng stationed himself in Linru, supervising his troops to pursue the enemy along the Shuizhai, Pengpo, and Ludian lines. Because the Feng Yuxiang’s army troops of Liu Ruming and Li Hualong harassed the Lushan and Yexian areas, Yang Hucheng ordered Sun Weiruning’s brigade to fight fiercely with Liu and Li's troops, and finally defeated them. The remnants of Liu and Li fled to Jia County, and were surrounded by Cao Shiwen's brigade. Sun's brigade joined other two brigades on the front line, and occupied Yuxian, Baimasi, Licun, Jin 围, Xigong and other places on the 1st. On the 2nd, they occupied Longmen Street, and contacted the Feng division in Pangou from Zhuge Village and Sima Street to advance.</p>
<p>Central Route: The Central Army on the central route, after conquering Linying, immediately advanced in separate ways. The advance troops had already crossed Xuchang and approached Xinzheng. However, because the Feng Yuxiang’s army on this route was relatively strong and strong fortifications were built everywhere, it was not easy to capture. It was found that the Feng Yuxiang’s army stationed in Xuchang was the troops of Tian Jinkai, Song Tiancai, and Jiao Wendian. Those stationed in Zhengzhou and Xinzheng were the troops of Liang Guanying, Zhao Dengyu, and Liu Chunrong. Lu Zhonglin also stationed in Zhengzhou to command. The Central Army launched a fierce attack and successively recovered Chonggang, Duqu, Dayangzhuang, Fancheng, Longwangmiao, Getangzhai, Baligiao, Zhangdian Street and other places. At the same time, Jiao Wendian and Song Tiancai contacted to surrender. Tian Jinkai's troops then retreated to Yucheng. The Central Army then recovered Xuchang Railway Station and the four gates in the east, west, north, and south on the 2nd, and entered the city on the 3rd. After the recovery of Xuchang, the Feng Yuxiang’s army was extremely shocked. Liu Chunrong also requested to show his sincerity after Song and Jiao. Liang and Zhao's troops fled north in a panic, and Lu Zhonglin also retreated from Zhengzhou to 濚泽. It is heard that Liu Zhi has received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the various troops to recover Zhengzhou within three days (October 3).</p>
<h3 id="e60">French Consul in Hankou Protests Arrest of Communist Bandits <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Garrison Department has rejected the protest. Hankou Dispatch: At 7 p.m. on the 26th of last month, Yang Qi, the company commander of the 6th company of the 3rd Training Division, led two soldiers to pursue the bandit Zhao Xiuwen. The bandit fled into the French Concession for fear of crime. Yang Qi desperately chased after him and shot but missed. The bandit then escaped from the crowd. The soldier has not returned to the company and his whereabouts are unknown. The French Consul Bordeaux protested to the Garrison Department on this case, claiming that our army's actions were outside the law. After receiving the protest letter, the Garrison Department replied to the French Consul on the 3rd. The French Consul's protest letter and the Garrison Department's reply are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>French Consul's Protest Letter: I am writing to inform you that at 7 p.m. on the 26th of this month, gunshots occurred on Futang Street in this concession. At that time, a Chinese military officer, identified as Yang Qi, the company commander of the 6th regiment of the 3rd Training Division, brought two soldiers from the 5th company to pursue a man named Zhao Xiuwen. They heard that he had entered the concession, and when they saw him enter No. 8 Xinchengli, they decided to arrest him. When Zhao saw them go upstairs and enter the room, he jumped out of the window and escaped. Yang Qi and the soldiers fired guns into the street from the window. Zhao retaliated and fled to Youyi Street. The above-mentioned situation was recounted by Yang Qi to the chief inspector of this patrol room after the incident, and he also went to the scene of the incident to investigate. However, yesterday (the 28th), several military officers suddenly went to the patrol room to inquire about Yang Qi's whereabouts. From this, it can be seen that he has not returned to the camp, and Dr. He, who lives at No. 8 Xinchengli, has not returned home since he left home on the 25th. There are many doubts. However, this consul protested to your headquarters against the Chinese military officers' extra-legal actions in this concession. If the military officer was indeed pursuing bandits, he should have reported to the patrol room for handling after entering the concession. Why was it difficult to surround and arrest them, and it could also avoid the danger of shooting in the street and hurting innocent pedestrians. This is a tribute to you, Bordeaux, September 29. Garrison Department's Reply: In reply to your letter of September 29, regarding the case of Yang Qi, the company commander of the 6th regiment of the 3rd Training Division, bringing two soldiers to arrest bandits at No. 8 Xinchengli, Zhao Xiuwen jumped out of the window and escaped, and there was a gunfight, in addition to the original text on file, which is omitted in full, at the end it says that the consul protested to your headquarters against the Chinese military officers' extra-legal actions in this concession. If the military officer was indeed pursuing bandits, he should have reported to the patrol room for handling after entering the concession. Why was it difficult to surround and arrest them, and it could also avoid the danger of shooting in the street and hurting innocent pedestrians, etc. After investigating this case, the head of the regiment, Zhang Dingming, reported that according to a secret report from Yang Qi, the company commander of the 5th company, He Long recently sent bandits to Wuhan to conspire to riot. Zhao Xiuwen was responsible for military guidance. The officer had met the bandit before and requested that someone be sent to arrest him as soon as possible to prevent trouble. The head of the regiment, in order to maintain local order and prevent future troubles, sent the officer to Hankou with two soldiers to secretly arrest him. It was heard that on the afternoon of the 26th, the officer caught sight of the bandit on Huajie and immediately stepped forward to arrest him. The bandit fled into Xinchengli in the French Concession for fear of crime. The officer and soldiers may have been unaware of the concession regulations, or they did not have time to distinguish which street belonged to the concession. In a desperate chase, they opened fire from a distance but missed the bandit, causing him to escape. As for the officer and soldiers who have not returned to the company and whose whereabouts are unknown, it is difficult to guess whether they have been murdered by bandits. People are being sent out to search for them. It was found that the officer entered the concession to arrest bandits without reporting to the patrol room for assistance, which was unclear. Or they did not have time to distinguish which street belonged to the concession, and they were in a hurry to chase after them, resulting in errors, which were not intentional. This is the reason why we are replying to you for your information and hope for your understanding. Please also order your concession patrol room to investigate the whereabouts of the officer and soldiers and reply. To the French Consul General in Hankou, Commander Xia Douyin, October 3.</p>
<h3 id="e61">There are No Jin Army in Shandong <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: After the Jin army retreated westward from the north bank of the Yellow River on the 23rd of last month, they initially occupied the area around Linqing and Dongchang, deploying defenses along the Grand Canal to the north and south, in an attempt to make a final resistance. Han Fuju ordered the 12th Army Commander Sun Tongxuan to station in Pingyuan, commanding the various armies to pursue westward. Today, Zhang Yue, the chief of staff of the general headquarters, told me that the Jin army in the Dongchang and Linqing area, in view of the fact that the overall situation in Pinghan and Longhai has passed, and our army is pressing westward very urgently, the several counties in western Shandong can no longer be held for a long time, and they have completely retreated since the 30th. Ma Jingong's brigade of our 20th Division arrived in Linqing from Pingyuan last night. There are no traces of the Jin army in Shandong. The county magistrates of the counties in Luxi and Dongchang have all reported to take office. The province is now completely unified. In order to avoid misunderstandings, our army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway did not advance further north after reaching Dezhou. The Northeast Army arrived at Lianzhen Station yesterday and did not come south again. Neither side stationed troops at the two stations in the middle, Sangyuan and Anlingzhen. The Northeast Army on the east side of the railway arrived at Wuqiao, and it is heard that the Northern Army will also arrive near Jingxian on the west side of the railway. It is currently the responsibility of Cao Fulin's department of the 14th Army. The 73rd Division's Zhan Shutang Department and the pistol brigade's Lei Taiping Department are stationed in Jiaodong to suppress bandits. At present, local bandits have been gradually eliminated, and in the future, we can concentrate on political aspects. Chairman Han is very concerned about bandit suppression and rural clearing (October 2).</p>
<h3 id="e62">Fujian Expeditionary Forces Will Attack Shuikou <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Liu and Yang Discuss Reorganizing Surrendered Troops. Because of Defending Shuikou, Fuzhou Correspondence: After the Eastern Route Expeditionary Force contacted the Lu army, the total number of reports from the front in recent days is roughly as follows: (1) Zhang Chunguang's troops of the Right Wing Column fought fiercely with Lu Xinming at Wutongping on the morning of the 26th, and the artillery fire has not stopped. Lin Shouguo once went to the front line to supervise the battle, and returned to Gu yesterday. (2) Lin Bingzhou's regiment of the Right Wing Column arrived at Shiping on the afternoon of the 27th, and contacted Zhou Zhiqun's troops on the morning of the 28th. Liu Shangzhi of the Central Column also led his troops into Shiping on the afternoon of the 27th to respond, and divided a part of them to station in Niutoutang and a part to station in Changqiao. On the 29th, Lin's regiment advanced from Taoyuan to Shuikou. (3) After Gui Zhenyuan's troops of the Left Wing Column entered the mouth of Minqing, they divided half of their troops and crossed the river from Xiaqi to contact the Central Column. The two troops of Huang Bingwu and Liang Jichuan under their command stationed in Minqing and took the road to Taopingdian. (4) The General Reserve Team has advanced to Daruo. Deputy Division Commander Yan Er'ai has completed the deployment in Daruo and advanced to Anren early on the 30th. (5) Chen Wantai's troops on the North Road advanced from Dahu and arrived at Changqiao yesterday, forming a unified force with the Central Column. (6) After the troops of each route contacted each other, they launched a fierce attack at the same time on the morning of the 30th, using mobile machine guns to shoot. The Lu army was unable to resist and collapsed towards the mouth of the valley. (7) The Lu army defended the retreat route at the mouth of the valley with Lu Xinming, and Zhou Zhiqun was in charge of the troops on the left side of the provincial army, attacking the troops. Lu Xingrong and Yu Bailiang were in charge of the troops attacking Shuikou on the front of the provincial army, but the soldiers had no fighting spirit and abandoned Shuikou. The provincial army will fight a major battle between Huangtian, Zhanghu, and Banpo after the victory over Shuikou. (8) This time, the three-way expeditionary forces of the left, right, and central routes all took the land route. At present, from Hongtang to the north, whether it is land or water, it is within the scope of the provincial army. In order to facilitate the supply of military supplies to the front line, the province has already decided to use small steamers to transport them by water. (9) The remnants of Chen Rongbiao, Zhang Ziming, and Chen Heling's two regiments have retreated from Gutian to the Luoyuan County area, waiting for orders to reorganize. The strength of the two regiments is still more than 2,000 people, with more than 1,500 rifles, and sufficient ammunition and military uniforms. Zhang Chen has sent a representative, Zhang Yangwen, to the province with Song Qian to report everything to the provincial authorities. Chen Jiliang sent a telegram to Zhang Chen yesterday, praising them. (10) On the morning of the 30th, Jiang Hong's plane went to the front to reconnoiter and found hundreds of Lu army troops near Shuikou moving towards the valley. In the afternoon, Zhao Zhixiong drove the plane again, carrying two bombs to help the battle. It was found that the Lu army was only three or four li away from Shuikou, and about five or six hundred Lu army troops were seen on the Jiangbian of Niutoutang. Today, Jiang Guanhao returned to the province from Xiamen to join the front-line battle, and it is planned to send a telegram to the Shanghai Aviation Office to transport the Jiang Guan, Jiang Lu, and Jiang Dao No. 3 seaplanes from Ding'an to Fujian to help the battle (October 1).</p>
<p>In addition, the Expeditionary Force is divided into East and West routes. The Eastern route is supervised by Liu Heding, with Liu's Division as the mainstay, joining Zhang's Division, Supplementary Brigade, Huang Zhuang Department, and advancing along the Minjiang River, having recovered Xiaoruo, Minqing, and Zhupi. The Western route is supervised by Fang Shengtao, with the regiments of Wang Chengyun, Huang Kesheng, and Lin Qinglong of Zhang's Division as the mainstay, joining Xiao Shu</p>

<p>Xuan Chen Guohui's troops, advancing from Dehua and Datian to Youxi. It is reported that Lu Xingbang's final plan is to defend Yanping with Zhou Zhiqun's troops and Youxi and Shaxian with 部's troops. Based on the situation, the fierce battle will be in Yanping, Youxi, Datian, and other places.</p>
<p>In addition, the Supplementary Brigade, Huang Zhao Department, Huang Baoyun Regiment, and the 123rd Battalion of the newly编 First Division in northern Fujian are now assisting Liu's Division in attacking Shuikou. The Fourth Battalion is advancing towards Chongyang. Lu Xingbang and Zhou Zhiqun's two troops have retreated to Shuikou and lost their strength, and they no longer have combat capabilities. After the two regiments of Zhang Ziming and Chen Heling of Chen Rongbiao's troops surrendered to the Provincial Army, Wang Tianzhong's troops also requested to be reorganized. Liu Heding is currently discussing reorganization with the Provincial Government. Lin Bingzhou's regiment of the Eastern Route Right Wing advanced to Tangshouqiao on the 27th, repelled Zhou Zhiqun's troops of eight or nine hundred people, and occupied Shiping. At present, there are no Lu army in Gutian, Minqing and other areas. Although Lu and Zhou are still in Shuikou, the advance of Liu and Gui's two brigades in the east, the approach of Huang Zhao's department of the Supplementary Brigade of one division in the south, and the interception of the Lu army's retreat to Yanping by Lin's regiment in the north have formed an impasse on all sides, and Shuikou will be taken soon.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen, the commander of the bandit suppression in Fujian, believes that the bandits within the garrison area have been gradually eliminated, and it is urgent to thoroughly clear the countryside to consolidate security. A pacification office for Zhang, Tong, Yan, Ping and Sui has been established, with the second brigade commander Yang Fengnian concurrently serving as the director, and the county magistrates concurrently serving as members. The office was established on the 16th, and a meeting of county magistrates was convened to discuss important cases of rural clearing and joint defense, which were submitted to the bandit suppression headquarters for approval and ordered to be carried out.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Personnel Decisions for Institutions in Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Farewell Words</p>
<p>Encourage Everyone to be Honest and Self-Disciplined</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The Northeast is extremely cautious about the selection of personnel to take over Beiping and Tianjin. They have learned from the past failures in entering the customs, which were mostly due to the improper use of personnel. Therefore, this time, they are determined to select people for the job and will never choose jobs for people. Zhang Xueliang greatly appreciated Zhu Qiqian for the post of mayor of Beiping and sent his secretary Zhu Guangmu (Zhu Qiqian's son-in-law) to Beiping to seek Zhu's opinion. Zhu has declined and personally wrote to Zhang, hoping that he would not propose it. For the post of mayor of Tianjin, he wants to rely on Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University. Zhang's reputation is indeed suitable for the job. However, he is a famous figure in the education circle in the North, and he may not be willing to enter politics. As for the selection of personnel for second-level institutions, they have generally been determined. For example, Zhang Xueming and Bao Yulin's appointment as the police chiefs of Tianjin and Beiping have been reflected in the facts. Zhang Xueming is Xueliang's younger brother. He graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and is very friendly with Xueliang. He was originally scheduled to serve as the police chief of Qingdao and was about to take office. When the Northeast Army entered the customs to take over the defense, Tianjin was more important than Qingdao, so the original plan was changed and he was appointed as the chief of Tianjin. He is currently preparing to come to Tianjin to take office and sent people to Tianjin a few days ago to investigate the situation of the Public Security Bureau. Bao Yulin is Bao Guiqing's nephew, who stayed in Beiping to maintain law and order when the Feng Army came out of the customs the year before last. At that time, the good discipline of the military was praised by Chinese and foreigners. The people of Beiping naturally welcomed him back. The above are more important and have been disclosed by various newspapers. Yesterday, I obtained a list of all the institutions in Beiping and Tianjin from important figures in the Northeast who passed through Tianjin. There are many that are not known to the outside world. Here is a complete list of them to get a glimpse of the whole picture. Han Linsheng, superintendent of Tianjin Customs (former director of Jichang Railway Bureau), Hong Weiguo, salt transport envoy of Changlu (former superintendent of Shanhaiguan), Wang Shouzhong, director of the mint, Ge Guangting, director of Pinghan Railway Bureau, Zeng Guangzhang, director of PingSui Railway Bureau, Yao Hong, director of Hebei Provincial Department of Finance, Shuxuexi, director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Lin Chengxiu, director of the Department of Construction, Chang Bingyi, director of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, Jing Youyan, special commissioner of Finance, Chai Shiwen, director of Dagu Shipyard, Fan Chunfu, director of Yuguan Public Security Bureau, Liang Ji, director of Tangshan Public Security Bureau, Shi Wei, director of the Stamp Tax Office, Wang Tao, director of the Beiping Municipal Bureau of Finance, Wang Jiexia, director of the Education Bureau, Kang Ruifu, director of the Telephone Bureau, Wu Yintang, director of the Directorate General of Telecommunications, Bao Zhusun, director of the River Affairs Bureau, Zang Qifang, director of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs (concurrently serving as the acting mayor), Liu Hainian, director of the Bureau of Finance, Tao Jingtan, director of the Bureau of Public Works, Ning Xiangnan, director of Special District Two, Lu Lu, director of Special District Three. The original director of the Telephone Bureau, Duan Maolan, remains in office, and Zhao Manlin, director of the Telegraph Bureau. The above officials will all come to Tianjin with Wang Shuchang, the commander of the Second Army, on the 30th to take over their respective positions. Zhang Xueliang specially hosted a banquet for the officials at the commander's office on the 25th. At the end of the banquet, Zhang stood up and gave a speech, saying that the Northeast had entered the customs and taken power many times, but there were almost no achievements to speak of. This time, due to the urging of the central government and various parties, they entered the customs peacefully. He could not help but give special encouragement. You must be honest and self-disciplined, and strive to serve the country above and protect the people below. You should wash away the previous habits of prostitution, gambling, bullying and acting as a false tiger, and strive to win some face for the Northeast and make a contribution to the country. You all have food to eat here. If you do not cherish yourselves, I will not be able to help you. Not only will you not have food to eat, but you may not even be able to keep the tools for eating (referring to heads). This is what you should pay attention to. Zhang's words were serious, and everyone was moved (September 29).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Wuxi Chamber of Commerce's Opinion on Holding Business Registration <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>List Six Research Points</p>
<p>Cable All County Chambers of Commerce to Adopt</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government held a business tax and specially convened representatives from various county chambers of commerce the other day, and Ren Zhen held a meeting to discuss the measures. It was decided to change the business registration and collect the registration fee as a transitional measure, and provisional regulations were formulated. Cheng Jingtang, the representative sent by the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce to the provincial meeting, has returned to Wuxi and reported the results of the meeting. The association has specifically listed six research points on the issue of business registration in Jiangsu Province and sent a telegram to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the chambers of commerce of various counties earnestly study them. The text of the telegram is recorded below: 1. All the members of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce and the chambers of commerce of all the counties, the telegrams have been sent, the Jiangsu Province business tax meeting, and the results of the report by the representative of our association. The change of business registration and the collection of registration fees, Chen, the director of the Finance Department, delivered an opening speech and stated that the provincial government had long had the determination to abolish the likin, and this transitional measure was to change the business tax after the future abolition of the likin. The method is extremely simple, the donation rate is based on the capital, and merchants are allowed to report it themselves. No other collection agency will be set up, and the financial bureaus of various counties will be entrusted to handle it concurrently. It can be seen that the government is considerate of the people's hardships and is meticulous in every possible way. It is found that business registration was decided by the Ministry of Finance's likin abolition meeting in the Republic of China in 1928. The first article of the general outline of the measures for collecting business tax in various provinces lists the matters clearly, which is similar to the fourth article of the temporary regulations on business license donation originally formulated by Jiangsu Province this time. However, the second item clearly states that no license fee will be charged for business licenses. It seems that there is no provision for the collection of registration fees. However, since the provincial government has sincerely encouraged it to alleviate the current financial difficulties of Jiangsu Province, how dare businessmen and the people not share the difficulties together, in order to live up to the Constitution. However, since it is based on the premise of preparing for the business tax, all measures should still be based on the general outline of the measures for collecting business tax in various provinces decided by the Ministry of Finance's likin abolition meeting in 1928. There are several matters that should be carefully studied: 1. The original plan for the business registration fee is to collect 1/1000 to 2/1000 of the capital. It seems that the business tax rate is stipulated in Article 2 of the original method, but the second item of the same article also has the types and conditions of the business. If there are special circumstances in each province, it may formulate its own flexible measures and tax standards and report them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. However, the tax rate levied shall not be higher than the provisions of this outline. Is it appropriate to collect a kind of handling fee at the highest business tax rate? This should be researched. 2. The collection of the business tax registration fee is a transition for the business tax. If the business tax is levied again in the future, according to Article 1, Item 2 of the original method, the license must be renewed once a year. Is it still necessary to collect the registration fee? This should be researched. 3. Director Chen of the Finance Department stated in his opening speech that the donation rate is based on capital and merchants are allowed to report it themselves. However, Article 6 of the temporary regulations stipulates that the collection agency shall send personnel to investigate the amount of capital once a year. When deemed necessary, it may check various covenants, contracts, and account books. Article 11 of the implementation rules stipulates that the county bureaus shall send investigators to various townships in the winter of each year to investigate the business situation and the increase or decrease of capital in order to rectify the amount of donations. Will there be any disputes in the future? This should be researched. 4. Article 3 of the original method stipulates that if the business tax is overdue, an additional 10% will be charged for each month that it is overdue, up to 30%. However, Article 11 of the temporary regulations originally formulated by Jiangsu Province stipulates that anyone who operates without a license, or conceals capital and underreports it, shall be ordered to pay the amount in full after being found out, and shall be fined one time the amount that should be paid. It seems that the penalty rules are heavier than the original method. This should be researched. 5. Article 5 of the original method stipulates that a business tax review committee shall be established to be filled by collection officials, members of the chamber of commerce, and accountants. However, Article 7 of the implementation rules of the temporary regulations originally formulated by Jiangsu Province stipulates that the county bureaus shall invite the chairman of the chamber of commerce as a consultant to assist in all matters when handling business license donations. It seems that it is not as appropriate as establishing a review committee according to the original method. This should be researched. 6. Business tax is local income and is recorded in Article 1 of the original method, but there is a difference between local provinces and counties, and the county local fees are also difficult. If it is necessary to follow suit in the future, it is not what merchants and the people can afford. Should there be a clear indication of restrictions or prior proper allocation to avoid repeated burdens on merchants and the people? This should be researched. In short, the collection of business registration fees in Jiangsu Province is a transition for preparing the business tax. If the planning is not thorough, it will be an obstacle to the future business tax. It seems that both officials and the people should conduct thorough research to promote the benefits as much as possible, so as not to live up to the meaning of the current government's diligence in seeking the people's sentiments and broad consultation. Our association's views are exhausted, and we dare not spare our foolishness, so we specially send a telegram to report it. I hope you will adopt it and look forward to your public view.

<p>Gang Leader Arrested in Suzhou: Xia Jinrong, the leader of the Henan gang in Taihu Lake, also known as Xia Da, repeatedly colluded with other gang leaders such as Tian Pangzi and Mao Zilong to rob Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province, last winter. In February of this year, he robbed the Shenhu small ferry boat, kidnapped people, and killed them. This spring, during the suppression of bandits by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Water Police, he killed Li Guobin, the captain of the Third District Guerrilla Team in Suzhou, and wounded Xu Pucheng, the head of the Third District in Zhejiang. He has committed numerous crimes and has been on the run. Recently, he was found hiding in Suzhou. On the night before yesterday (the 3rd), Cai Jun and Liu Hongkui, two detectives from the Zhejiang Water Police, came to Suzhou and arrested Xia Jinrong and his wife at Room 6 of the Sanxin Inn outside the gate. They were sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. A telephone report was made to the Third District of the Zhejiang Water Police in Jiaxing. Yesterday (the 4th), the Zhejiang Third District dispatched the Zhiguo warship to Suzhou and took Xia and his wife back to Zhejiang to face justice.</p>
<p>Temporary Bandit Suppression Command Headquarters Abolished: The Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters, due to the bandit leader Taibao Ashu and his gang disturbing Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, specially appointed Hu Zhengji as the Temporary Commander for Bandit Suppression in Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, and Pinghu counties. The Wuxian County Water and Land Police Force was also placed under Hu's command. Now that Taibao Ashu's bandit gang has been repeatedly suppressed by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang water and land military police, their strength has been completely lost, and they have dispersed into the villages in the Jinshan and Pinghu areas, hiding their weapons to avoid the attention of the authorities. Commander Hu, after receiving reports, believed that the ongoing village cleansing in various counties was sufficient to eliminate the remaining bandits, so he reported to the Headquarters to temporarily abolish the Temporary Command Headquarters. The regiment was ordered to send a company of soldiers to Jinshan and Pinghu counties to assist in the village cleansing. Commander Xiong, based on this, notified the County Government yesterday for information.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Refugees Heading South: After the Huang County Magistrate reported to the Civil Affairs Department for instructions on how to eliminate the concerns about the harassment and plundering of property by more than 400 refugees from Hunan in Yinshan Town, an order was received yesterday to have each water police chief work together to prevent the problem. A report was also sent to the Provincial Government, informing neighboring provinces to stop the refugees from leaving their province, and issuing orders to the counties north of the river to follow the previous orders and crack down on refugees heading south to cut off the source.</p>

<p>Militia Police Massacre Villagers While Suppressing Bandits: An exchange of fire between police and bandits occurred in Huangcun Town on the border of Jiangyin the day before yesterday. The bandits fled toward Baizhang Xutang in Wujin. At about 4:00 AM on the 3rd, Liu Zaigeng, the head of the Sixth District of the county, led over a hundred armed militia police and plainclothes officers to surround Baizhang Town. First, they disarmed the town's security force and placed six members under guard, then searched the suspected Nanjie shops. It was then learned that the Fushengxiang Beijing goods shop was suspected of harboring bandits, so they broke down the door. The shop owner, Peng Jinkang, was the head of Changshou Township. His younger brother, Peng Quanlin, lived behind the shop. The militia police opened the door to Peng Quanlin's room, dragged Quanlin out of bed naked to the door, and shot him, killing him instantly. Then, they used a kitchen knife to cut off Quanlin's head and took it away. Over twenty people from various shops, including Liu Mengqing, were arrested. Farmer Song Jingru was also hit by a stray bullet near the ear. Those arrested and Peng Quanlin's head were taken to Huangtu Town. After an interrogation, the head was sent back, and the suspects were released on bail. Among them, Jin Shougen, Han Genda, and Liu Yulin were to be sent to Jiangyin for interrogation. Cheng Foyu, the head of the Fourth District of Wujin County, reported the aforementioned situation upon hearing the news and immediately telegraphed the County Government and the County Court, stating that Peng Quanlin was neither a bandit nor a villain and that this massacre was too cruel to bear. The County Government then dispatched Police Squad Captain Jiang Bingkun to lead a team to investigate, and the County Court Supervisory Prosecutor led officials to conduct a post-mortem examination on the morning of the 4th.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Investigates Miao Wencai Suicide Case Thoroughly: After Ma Yiyong from the Police Academy came to Cheng to investigate the shooting death of Miao Wencai, the head of the Shengang Public Security Fifth Branch, it could not be determined that Miao Wencai committed suicide. Due to various doubts, he requested the county to investigate thoroughly. The County Magistrate ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and reply. Director Li ordered Inspector Wu Bingjun to conduct a fair investigation and reply, stating briefly that according to the investigation on September 6, there were five suicide notes. The gunshot wound to the corpse was in the center of the forehead, and the bullet hole was the size of a teacup, with the skin and flesh around the entry point ruptured and blood stains all over the bed. The corpse was lying down. The investigators repeatedly examined it and determined that it was indeed suicide. When interviewing the local people, they also said that there were no other circumstances. Miao's elder brother also proved that the suicide notes were in his own handwriting and requested exemption from inspection. However, his brother filed a complaint alleging that his younger brother's death was caused by the repeated pressure from Fu Xuennian, the clerk of the branch, citing the phrase "leaving me no place to stand" in the suicide note as proof. The words "Fu Xuennian's coercion" may be suspicious. As for whether Miao Wencai was killed, according to conscience, it is difficult to believe, etc. The report was submitted to the bureau and then to the county for review and handling.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Opinions on Tax Revenue Policies of the Committee Designed by Gamal of the Ministry of Finance (Continued) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Now let us discuss the position of indirect taxes in China's tax system. Regarding stamp duty, the committee has thoroughly discussed it in the draft stamp duty law and its explanatory memorandum submitted on January 18, 1929. Apart from this, there are indirect taxes on goods.</p>
<p>At present, the national government's revenue largely depends on customs duties, especially import duties. From the perspective of the situation, this tax revenue will still be a major financial source for China's reliance in the years to come. Generally speaking, old taxes are easier to collect than new taxes. Customs duties have long been regarded as part of China's tax system, so their collection is easier than that of new taxes. Moreover, because customs duties are relatively unaffected by political turmoil, their administrative efficiency is greater than that of general inland tax administration. For all these reasons, if careful consideration is given when formulating tax regulations, it will be easier to increase revenue from customs import duties than from other tax sources. From an administrative point of view, China's tax revenue should rely on import customs duties. However, other aspects should also be considered, especially the burden of taxation. What impact does the imposition of import duties on goods used by the poorer classes have on the prices of goods? This is a question that we cannot but study. Here is a brief discussion of this topic:</p>
<p>Most of the imported goods used by the poorer classes in China are cotton fabrics, kerosene, cigarettes, matches, light wood, and needles. The average annual value of these goods imported from foreign countries between 1925 and 1928 was 353,000,000 taels of customs silver, accounting for one-third of the total imports. Although this amount does not fully represent the burden of customs duties on the poor, if the increase in tax rates can be limited to imported goods other than the above, and appropriate regulations are made on the tax rates levied, then the tax revenue from imported goods will be greater than that currently collected. On the one hand, the burden on the poor will be avoided from being significantly increased, and on the other hand, no class will be unduly burdened.</p>
<p>There is considerable reason to believe that customs import duties will not unduly burden the poor. There is also no doubt that other parts of China's tax system are sufficient to unduly burden the poor. Let us first talk about the salt tax:</p>
<p>Salt is a necessity of life. Regardless of whether they are poor or rich, the amount they consume does not vary much. Moreover, the handling of salt tax collection is not appropriate. Even if the handling is appropriate, the amount of tax paid by each person will definitely not differ according to each person's ability to pay taxes. The people's economic capacity should be the standard for paying taxes, but in fact, it is the opposite. In other words, this kind of tax that is light on the rich and heavy on the poor is an unfair tax. Although various commodity taxes somewhat contain this kind of unfairness, it is especially obvious when this kind of tax is imposed on daily necessities such as salt. In addition, the regular customs duties, re-import duties, and taxes on goods traveling between various ports in China have the same situation.</p>
<p>Since this tax has the effect of unduly burdening the poor, when formulating the tax system, efforts should be made to eliminate this kind of unfair tax. This is not only a wise policy, but also deeply in line with humanitarianism.</p>
<p>Based on these reasons, this committee specifically recommends the collection of consumption taxes on matches and cement. The taxation of these kinds of goods is indeed stipulated in the special consumption tax regulations. However, this committee recommends that the aforementioned two kinds of flowage taxes not be collected directly from consumers, but from producers. The reason why this kind of tax is called a consumption tax is that this tax money is usually added to the price of the goods, so that the person paying the tax is the person consuming the goods.</p>
<p>There are several points in the current special consumption tax regulations that are questionable. These regulations include a wide range of taxable goods, making it impossible to estimate the possible impact of this kind of tax on society. Even regarding the determination of the tax rate and the selection of taxable goods, it seems that the possible impact on industry has not been given due consideration. Often, the same goods are taxed repeatedly during various stages of their manufacture. Therefore, in order to avoid double taxation, there must be complicated regulations regarding tax refunds. In general, the implementation of any tax must pay attention to the scope and possible impact of this tax, and attention must also be paid to avoiding tax overlap. Other aspects, such as the selection of taxable goods, whether the tax rate is appropriate, whether the administrative organization is effective, and whether it is economical, and whether the administrative methods are suitable for the special conditions of industry, should all be studied. This committee's draft special consumption tax law on cement and the special consumption tax law on matches are believed to be in line with the aforementioned tax requirements. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Seamen's Wage Increase Movement <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Stance of Six Foreign Shipping Companies</p>
<p>Three Methods Determined</p>
<p>Recently, seamen have been negotiating with foreign shipping companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson regarding wage increases, but no resolution has been reached. This matter has been reported in this newspaper several times. After investigation, this matter has causes and consequences. The seamen's demands are extremely legitimate. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Tang Hesheng and others, the standing committee members of the Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Industrial Union, to inquire about the progress of this matter. They provided a detailed account of the process and current steps, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Motivation for Wage Increases: Seamen first proposed the demand for wage increases in the spring of last year, referring to the wages of the stokers, sailors, and stewards on the river and sea vessels. They requested a reasonable increase, as seamen's wages were already very low and had not been increased for ten years. During the tenth year of the Republic, the Seamen's Union in Hong Kong made a wage increase request to British shipowners, stipulating that seamen's wages should be increased every three years. However, more than ten years have passed, and the shipowners have not fulfilled this agreement. Last spring, after the seamen's request for wage increases was drafted, it was painfully suspended due to the ongoing campaign against the rebels, fearing that it would be disrupted by reactionaries and hinder the current situation. This year, due to the sharp rise in the cost of living, seamen were forced to make demands to the shipping companies.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Agree to Increase: After the Seamen's Union proposed the wage increase request this year, Yu Qiaqing, Chen Bogang, Chen Ganqing, and other members of the Shanghai Shipping Association invited representatives of the seamen and representatives of various Chinese shipping companies to a meeting for discussion. It was agreed to cancel the previously provided rice allowance and increase the wages of each seaman by six yuan, starting with four yuan in August of this year and an additional two yuan starting in March of next year. At that time, the seamen also expressed their agreement, and the Shipping Association informed all Chinese shipping companies in the association to implement the agreed wage increase plan.</p>
<p>Negotiations with Six Foreign Ships: The foreign shipping companies in this port that operate on the river and sea routes and employ Chinese seamen include six companies: British Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Asia, American Jiejiang, Mobil, and Japanese Nisshin. There are more Chinese ships than foreign ships. Since the Seamen's Union made the wage increase request, it made the same request to the six foreign shipping companies. When the Chinese ships agreed to increase, the six foreign shipping companies still made no response. Because they are not members of the Shipping Association, the Seamen's Union had to negotiate with each of these companies separately. Nisshin, Mobil, Asia, and Jiejiang all claimed that if Taikoo and Jardine Matheson agreed to increase, they would also grant the increase according to the precedent.</p>
<p>The Stance of Foreign Merchants: After receiving the request from the Seamen's Union, the British Taikoo Company had several discussions with representatives of the union. First, it wanted to invite members of the Shanghai Shipping Association to mediate, but because it was not a member of the association, it was not convenient to proceed. Therefore, the union negotiated directly. After many consultations, Taikoo Company only agreed to cancel the two yuan rice allowance that it had automatically added in June and increase the wages of each person by three yuan. However, the seamen also had to add six yuan according to the increase promised by the Chinese ships. Now, only half of the amount is allowed, which is too far from the proposed amount, and the negotiations have not yielded results.</p>
<p>Steps to Proceed: Yesterday, the Seamen's Union originally planned to hold a meeting at 9 AM to discuss methods to deal with the wage increase requests to the various foreign shipping companies. However, because the members could not arrive on time, the meeting could not be held. Now, the union has already agreed on two methods to proceed: (1) Dispatch representatives to contact the six foreign shipping companies again to request: (A) First increase wages by six yuan, (B) Then increase wages once every five years. (2) The Seamen's Union will detail the negotiation process and the firm refusal of various foreign ships to increase wages and submit it to the Central Party Department, requesting the government to provide assistance as soon as possible to urge foreign shipowners to fulfill the wage increase conditions as soon as possible and resolve the case as soon as possible. (3) When negotiations break down and there is no other choice, the final countermeasure can only be implemented. However, if there is hope of compromise, they are determined not to adopt the breakup method.</p>

<p>Disaster Relief Day Today is the Disaster Relief Day of the seventh National Anti-Drug Campaign Week. The health campaign of the other day has been reported in the previous newspaper. The following is a summary of the Disaster Relief Day campaign:</p>
<h3 id="e89">Disaster Relief Day Measures <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>(A) Significance: The reason why our country has been plagued by famine and widespread disasters throughout history is ultimately due to the increasingly severe scourge of drugs. After intimidation and enticement, ignorant farmers have no choice but to plant opium, which reduces the amount of rice and food supply, leading to famine. If we do not seek remedies quickly, the crisis will appear immediately. Compatriots, how can we not wake up! (B) Purpose: The purpose of the Disaster Relief Day of this Anti-Drug Week is to awaken compatriots, understand the causes of famine in our country, unite to eliminate the drug demon, save millions of dying disaster victims, and restore the national spirit of our country. (C) Measures: (1) Implement rural education, (2) Investigate the actual situation in disaster areas caused by opium cultivation, (3) Organize anti-drug and disaster relief propaganda teams, (4) Hold anti-drug lectures and propaganda by the education party.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Outline of Propaganda for Disaster Relief Day <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Facts tell us that the fertilizer for growing opium consumes more than that for growing ordinary crops because its absorption is very large. Most farmers are very economical, and they are willing to provide as much as possible for the needs of opium. As a result, the original nourishment of the land for growing opium is gradually absorbed by it invisibly. That is, the "power of the soil" as the saying goes. Fertile land gradually becomes barren and weak. Therefore, if you change to growing other crops for one year, its production will naturally be reduced compared to land that has not grown opium. As a result, land that has been continuously planted with opium for several years will naturally be reduced. In general, if you change to growing crops with artificial fertilizer, how can it grow and harvest? This is the relationship between growing opium and soil deterioration. Gansu and Shaanxi provinces cannot transport heavy timber to foreign countries for resale due to inconvenient transportation, so they grow opium. Because opium is small in size and valuable, it is much lighter and more convenient than timber. The authorities strictly prohibit opium in order to regulate the province's finances. However, we think that if the transportation of heavy timber is impossible in Gansu due to inconvenient transportation, can heavy food be transported in? If food cannot be transported in, then it should be planted in its own place. Barley, evening primrose, millet, and beans are all important food crops in the north. Why don't they grow these crops and instead grow opium? Although opium is small in size, valuable, and easy to transport, no matter how much money you accumulate, you cannot survive if you cannot transport food. It is a suicidal policy to covet small profits and abandon people's lives. The situation in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou is similar. A few years ago, there was a great famine in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces. The Chinese and foreign charity organizations said that in the past, as long as there was money, food could be obtained everywhere. Now, real food must be transported to provide relief. The famine in Henan, Gansu, and Shaanxi last year was also the same phenomenon. It can be seen that growing opium does reduce food production, which not only affects the province but also affects the whole country. This is the relationship between growing opium and the lack of food, which leads to famine. According to our field survey of twenty opium-growing farmers, fifteen families like to grow opium and five families do not like to grow opium. It can be seen that most villagers also like to grow opium. The reason why they like to grow opium is because they covet high profits and steal opium taxes. If you carefully calculate it, you will lose money if you grow opium. They really didn't notice this. According to our field survey of thirty-seven farmers in Mengcheng Township, Anhui, the average cost of growing opium per acre is 32 yuan and 34 cents (including the cost of opium seedlings). The income per acre is only 23 yuan and 99 cents. As a result, you will lose 9 yuan and 35 cents per acre. Therefore, if you remove the opium seedlings, you will lose 9 yuan and 35 cents per acre. Therefore, you cannot avoid the cost of opium seedlings, and no one will not lose money if you grow opium. How important is the impact on farmers' livelihoods! This is the relationship between growing opium and farmers' livelihoods. From the above, we can know that although the famines in various places seem to be caused by unexpected floods and droughts, in fact, the lack of food has long been felt. However, it is becoming more and more obvious due to floods and droughts. Farmers are influenced by opium cultivation, are tempted by bandits, and join the ranks of bandits, resulting in bandits filling the area. In addition to the military affairs that have been fought for revolution in recent years, the prolongation of the civil war and the conflict of Sheng mostly stem from the competition for opium tax collection. In this way, flood drought soldiers, the planting of opium is actually the main reason. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association leads the country to hold the seventh Anti-Drug Campaign Week and specifically holds a day as Anti-Drug Disaster Relief Day to arouse the attention of the people across the country. Anti-drug comrades, we should thoroughly realize the various bad effects and bad consequences of planting opium. Taking advantage of this campaign day, on the one hand, we must educate and propagate that not growing opium is the fundamental way to relieve disasters. On the other hand, we must urge the authorities to strictly prohibit opium cultivation as the only way to thoroughly reject drugs. Our steps are: on the side of the people, conduct field surveys of the amount of opium planted in farmland and the lives of farmers, and study the improvement of the soil after opium cultivation and the alternative crops for opium cultivation; on the government side, petition the government authorities to strictly prohibit opium cultivation, eradicate opium seedlings, abolish opium seedling tax, and punish the corrupt officials who collect opium tax.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Investigation Plan on Opium Cultivation in Various Provinces <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Based on the recent reports from anti-drug bodies across the country, according to reports from anti-drug comrades across the country, opium seedlings are still being planted and opium taxes and fines are being collected in Rehe, Liaoning, Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Henan, and northern Anhui, the same as before. Moreover, they are mostly forced to plant, not voluntarily planted by farmers. The famine has been going on for years, and the reason is actually planting here. The association has decided to conduct a nationwide investigation after the Anti-Drug Week to reduce disasters. It is reported that the main points of the investigation are as follows: (1) Whether the opium area has been effectively eradicated, (2) Whether there is any forced planting and tax collection by the military, (3) The living conditions of farmers, (4) Other crops suitable for converting opium fields.</p>

<p>The Christian churches in this city have always been enthusiastic about anti-drug activities. The Anti-Drug Association has asked them to support them unanimously. It is reported that all churches have expressed their sympathy for this Anti-Drug Campaign Week and will convene church members today to hold anti-drug worship. The association will distribute various colored pictures, slogans, propaganda outlines, and pledge forms for posting. All contacted churches have been notified by special letter, saying that members will be sent to the church to bring propaganda materials in advance. Please assist in posting them and give anti-drug speeches on the 5th Sunday of Worship, as well as solicit donations to assist our association in promoting anti-drug education and anti-smoking business. Please also let us know the progress.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Church Campaign Measures <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>In addition to issuing notices, the association has also formulated the measures for the church to hold the campaign, stating that all members of our church should do their duty. If there are teachers, they should do their best to promote God's justice and holiness so that soil traffickers and opium merchants can reform themselves. If believers, they should resolve to reject drugs and participate in persuading others to break away from opium. If we work together with one heart and one mind, success can be expected. Church groups and individuals should participate directly in anti-drug activities at any time and any place and work hard to promote them. During this Anti-Drug Week, they should also (1) hold anti-drug speeches to publicize the harm of opium, (2) investigate and report on the planting of drugs to the Anti-Drug Association, (3) promote the anti-smoking business and save addicts, (4) pray for the anti-smoking work and anti-drug campaign, (5) especially collect donations to support the anti-drug campaign. Today's special fundraising income will be used to fund the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Declaration Urging Strict Enforcement of Opium Prohibition <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The disaster of opium will lead to the destruction of the country. The harm is so terrible that it is beyond description. Since the National Government was established in Nanjing, it has repeatedly announced the prohibition in accordance with public opinion. At this time of national poverty, it is truly a good policy to save the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last words show us that the opium business cannot coexist with a national government that grants power to the people. The Kuomintang platform also clearly stipulates the harm of opium. Prohibition is the responsibility of the authorities to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the party, the country, and the people. No research or elaboration is needed. Without effective opium prohibition, there will be no way to face the party and the country, and no way to face public opinion. However, the situation of opium prohibition's neglect in recent years is truly heartbreaking. Opium poppies are all over Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Shaanxi, which can be attributed to the control of warlords or excused by the unrest in the local area. But what about Fujian and Anhui? The Anhui garrison is directly under the central government, and the Fujian navy is under the Ministry of the Navy. Opium seedlings are planted and ignored, or there are those who take the opportunity to profit from it. People complain, and public opinion is boiling, but the collection of taxes by the garrison has not stopped. The special tax in the two lakes was originally a temporary measure to clear the surplus of Wuhan's native opium and show compassion. Native opium merchants are already illegal, but now the situation has changed and is becoming more and more serious. The Ministry of Finance sends members to set up groups, crack down on smuggling, and sell native opium publicly and transport it without any scruples. Native opium taxes and levies amount to millions. Wherever the corrupt government reaches, the darkness is rampant. Recently, there have been rumors of expanding it to the whole country, which has caused the world to laugh and the country's reputation to be lost. The people's opposition has not had the slightest effect. Since its establishment, the Anti-Opium Commission has been subject to restrictions in exercising its powers, and major native opium cases have not been investigated. This has disappointed the public and dissatisfied society. Other cases, such as strange ships transporting native opium and spreading rumors in the League of Nations, have been safely transported into Shanghai after being leaked, showing the strictness of the protection and the greatness of the organization. The ancient saints said that when the upper and lower classes fight for profit, the country will be in danger. Today, the opium disaster in our country is due to the leased land in the concession and the relationship of foreigners. However, the source of the disaster is actually the sins of the Chinese people themselves. People must insult themselves before others insult them. The country must invade itself before others invade it. Today, our country is suffering from drug addiction to this extent, and there are still those who are willing to indulge in drugs in order to seek high profits. How can we accuse foreigners of harming us? Our association is entrusted by the people to eliminate drugs as its mission. Our hearts are in danger, and it is difficult to keep silent. Therefore, we have listed the facts and issued a declaration based on the main points of the resolution passed by the Shanghai Joint Conference of Various Groups of the Seventh National Anti-Drug Campaign Week on October 1. We hope that the National Government authorities will take strict measures to stop the cultivation of opium in various provinces, abolish the native opium tax in the two lakes, eliminate selfish feelings, and disregard interests. We must follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's words that the declaration of war on opium must never be compromised. If we can do this, the people of the whole country will bless and support us, and the achievements of the public will be forever recorded in history. The world will admire them for ten thousand years. It is time to correct the chaos and turn weakness into strength. We offer these few words, hoping for your consideration. We do not have time to calculate whether you know our guilt or blame us. This is the declaration.</p>

<p>The calendar for the twentieth year has been innovated again... It is planned to hand it over to the publishing house for printing. Recently, some unscrupulous merchants have colluded with vagrants to print and sell discarded calendars and sell them along the streets in the concession. The municipal government has sent a document to the special district court, ordering the police department to investigate and prohibit them. The public security bureau has also sent inspectors to secretly investigate, and the police station has seized a large number of discarded calendars. The court has punished them. It has been reported in this newspaper. Now it is reported that the Social Bureau has also completed the compilation and printing of the calendar for the twentieth year. The content is more complete than the calendar for the nineteenth year, and the compilation has been greatly innovated. Various texts are attached to ensure that people from all over the world can use it. Because the Social Bureau believes that during the period of political tutelage, it is necessary to pay attention to the spirit of the rule of law and the common sense that the people should have. The editing starts from this point. The draft has been completed and is now submitted to the municipal government for review and printing. It is reported that the Social Bureau intends that the calendar for the twentieth year should be printed by the book industry and the ink-colored lithography industry. Otherwise, the municipal government will still fund the printing and distribution. If various merchants want to print tens of thousands of copies like the Sanyou Industrial Society did last year and distribute them to customers, as well as publish advertisements in the calendar in the hope of receiving great results, they can contact the bureau as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Yuan, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued an order to all district offices and teams yesterday, stating that the order should be followed and that the autumn breeze is refreshing and the winter season is approaching in an instant. The territory of this city is vast, and defense is the most important thing. In recent years, major cases of kidnapping and robbery have occurred repeatedly in the concession. Villains have taken the opportunity to try to succeed, and they are especially afraid of invading the interior and disturbing the community. To this end, it is ordered that all district offices and teams should comply with this order, supervise their subordinates, and strictly prevent it. Appropriate protection should be given to the wealthy households in the territory invisibly. Various vehicles traveling to and from, as well as suspicious pedestrians and various large and small hotels, must be paid close attention. If necessary, inspections must be carried out to prevent robbers from getting away with fraud. On the one hand, patrols should be strengthened and the on-duty posts should be rectified. The director of this bureau has high hopes for this. All of you should adhere to this order and do not slack off.</p>

<p>Family Situation: Currently residing in the Xi household are three women: Mrs. Xi Tang, the mistress of the house; a paternal aunt of Mr. Xi's; and Tang Yixiu, the wet nurse brought from Yu (Henan Province), also known as Tang Tang, 36 years old, from Dong'an, Yongzhou, Yu. Tang had been working in the Xi family for over six years and was well-liked by her employers. Therefore, when the employers came to Shanghai to seek refuge, they brought her along to serve them.</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Thugs: At approximately 8:45 yesterday morning, the entire Xi household had risen and finished washing up. The wet nurse, Tang, was in the kitchen organizing items when suddenly three thugs wearing Zhongshan suits and long robes, speaking with a northern accent, intruded through the back door. They saw Tang as if she were invisible and intended to head straight upstairs. When Tang saw this, she was about to ask questions when the thugs pulled out pistols, forbade her from making noise, left one to watch her, and herded the rest of the household into a corner.</p>
<p>Tragic Death of the Wet Nurse: At that time, two thugs held Mrs. Xi Tang hostage and ordered her to go upstairs. The wet nurse, Tang, was extremely frightened and cried out, causing the thug watching her to fire three shots at her. The bullets hit her left temple and head, and she immediately fell to the ground, lifeless and dead. The two thugs holding the mistress inspected the upstairs and, seeing no one, and hearing the gunshots downstairs, dared not linger. They went downstairs together and fled through the back door without a trace.</p>
<p>Corpse Examination and Coffin Preparation: After the incident, the Lou Ka Wan Police Station was notified and immediately dispatched Detective Hong Chunxiang, Zhang Ziying, and others to investigate the scene. They carried the body to the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang mortuary for an autopsy. Subsequently, the French Concession Police Criminal Division reported to the French Court Judge Zhu Cheng, who arrived at the mortuary at 11:30 a.m. He confirmed that the deceased had died from gunshot wounds sustained before death. He ordered photographs to be taken and instructed the employer to prepare a coffin for burial, while the police would strictly investigate and arrest the criminals for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Major Fire on Qiaojia Road <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>A Madman, Qian Yanxing, Burns to Death</p>
<p>▲ Opium Smoking Causes a Devastating Fire</p>
<p>▲ Twenty Houses Destroyed in Two Hours</p>
<p>▲ Madam Wang Chen and Her Daughters Injured in Falls</p>
<p>The resident at No. 189, Qiaojia Road, inside the Great South Gate of the city, at the corner of the Meijia Lane entrance, a local named Wang Erxin, a Daoist priest by profession, has long been addicted to smoking opium. Every night at home, he lies on a couch, indulging in clouds of smoke from dusk till dawn, satisfying his opium cravings. At 3:30 a.m. yesterday, Wang was smoking opium in his upstairs bedroom when he carelessly left a spark in the firewood downstairs (because Wang's wife and mother usually made grass mats, there was a large amount of wheat straw piled downstairs). The fire quickly became uncontrollable and spread to the neighboring houses, affecting Nos. 208 to 204 along the street in Meijia Lane. However, the back doors of these houses, accessed through a small lane, had three rooms with side rooms and two houses. The front door was the wall gate at No. 193 Qiaojia Road and the side door at No. 191, which belonged to the Liao family. When the fire raged, the fire tower rang the alarm. At first, it was mistaken for a fire in Maojia Lane, and fire brigades from various districts rushed their pump trucks to Maojia Lane first. By the time they returned to the fire site, the fire had already spread widely, and it was very difficult to extinguish the fire in the houses at the back. The fire was finally extinguished after about two hours of burning. In this disaster, about twenty buildings were destroyed. The Liao family's three-room, two-side-room buildings were all reduced to ashes. Fortunately, the wall gate and side door buildings in front were not burned. When the fire broke out, all the residents were asleep. Upon hearing the fire alarm, they hastily put on their clothes and fled. None of their belongings could be retrieved, resulting in significant losses. Wang Erxin's wife, Wang Chen, and Wang's two daughters (the elder named San'nan, 17 years old, and the younger named Xiao Si, 11 years old) jumped from the upstairs windows (because the stairs had already been burned through), and were seriously injured in the falls. However, the two-year-old child that the woman was holding was unharmed. The director of the West District Fire Brigade, Mr. Xia, directed the members to help the woman and others into an ambulance and rushed them to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The most tragic case was that of a madman who was burned to death. A local man named Qian Yanxing, 40 years old, had worked on the railway in his twenties. He was frightened by thieves and became insane. He would bang on tables and chairs all day long, and even wave kitchen knives around. His family feared a major disaster, so they had locked him in a wooden cage in the east wing upstairs behind No. 193 for many years. Because the madman was as strong as an ox, he was also restrained with heavy chains. The madman's younger brother now works at the Xiamen Telegraph Bureau. Living together were the madman's mother, Qian Cai, and his brother's wife. When the fire broke out, his family only cared about their own lives and did not pay attention, so the madman was burned to death. After the fire was extinguished at dawn, the police from the First District, Third Precinct took Wang Erxin's mother, Wang Yuan, to the station for questioning. They also dug out the madman's body, which was charred beyond recognition, with a fractured right leg and both arms in a hugging posture, resembling a dried-out piece of wood. After people cut off the iron chains, they placed the body on a plank door. Shao Meisheng, the local community head from the 20th Precinct, reported to the Local Court requesting an autopsy. The corpse's mother, Qian Cai, also submitted a statement to the court requesting exemption from the autopsy. Her statement roughly stated that she was a local, 62 years old, and the deceased Qian Yanxing was my eldest son, 40 years old this year. He had long suffered from insanity. He was burned to death in this incident due to a neighbor's carelessness, and he was unable to escape. I now wish to prepare the coffin for burial myself and request exemption from the autopsy. The request was approved, and she was instructed to sign a guarantee for the record and quickly arrange for the burial.</p>
<h3 id="e102">One Hundred Thousand Yuan in Ransom Placed Inside a Broken Spittoon <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲ Extortionist Detective Reaches Into Spittoon</p>
<p>▲ Just As He Was About to Take the Money, He Was Arrested</p>
<p>▲ Twenty-Two Extortion Letters</p>
<p>▲ Two Criminals Await Sentencing</p>
<p>Wang Xiao'an, residing at No. 477 1/2, Meibai Road, received six threatening letters from gangsters last month. Initially, they attempted to extort 20,000 silver dollars, but later increased the amount to 100,000 dollars. The letters stated that if he was willing to pay the ransom, he should post a note at the lane entrance for contact. Wang reported the letters to the Xinzha Police Station, which instructed him to comply. Several days later, Wang received another letter stating, "We know you sincerely wish to negotiate. Now, take the money to a broken spittoon inside Jingxing Lane on North Henan Road. Someone will come to retrieve it. Otherwise, we will come to pick you up by car." Wang reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to wait. For several days, they did not see the criminals. On September 25th, Wang received another letter instructing him to deliver the ransom to the same location. Wang again reported to the police, who sent Chinese detectives Zhou Guisheng, Bao Tan Ma Zhongrong, Dong Xueyun, Sun Hanying, Yang Feizhang, and others to secretly wait. Not until around 5 a.m. the next morning did they see a criminal arrive, reach into the spittoon, retrieve a paper package, and look delighted. Just as he was about to leave, the detectives apprehended him, took him to the police station, and learned that his name was Chen Xiaobing, from Jiangbei. He was a rickshaw puller at No. 668, Jingxing Lane, North Henan Road. He also confessed that his accomplice was Song Ada, from Tongzhou, hiding inside No. 323 Chongqing Road. The detectives went and apprehended Song, and both were escorted to the Special District Local Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan continued the hearing. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stood up and presented the case, stating that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the defendant Chen Xiaobing had also written 22 letters between June 24th and August 25th, sending them to the home of Gu Xingchun, a Ningbo native, at No. 434, Xin Dagulu, in an attempt to extort 20,000 silver dollars. Gu Xingchun has also arrived in court, please question him, and then present the letter as evidence, please investigate. Gu Xingchun also stated that he was a clerk at Luo Maichen Foreign Firm at No. 34 Nanjing Road. After receiving the threatening letters, I reported to the police each time and sent detectives to wait, but they never saw him. When questioned, the defendant Chen Xiaobing admitted that he had written the threatening letters, but Song Ada denied it. After Judge Sun reviewed the evidence, he ordered both defendants to be detained and sentenced next Tuesday.</p>

<p>▲ The Maid's Shout of "Thieves" Deters the Robbers   ▲ Madam Shen Zhang Catches One Thief   ▲ The Thief with the Gun is Also Arrested   ▲ The Court Adjourns for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Shen Zhongfu, residing at No. 502 Yanping Road, West Shanghai, an employee of the Hua'an Cooperative Life Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road, lived with his wife, Zhang. Around 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, Shen had already gone to the company to work. Only Zhang and the maid, Wu Luo, were at home. Suddenly, four thieves broke in. One thief, holding a pistol, threatened to make a sound. Another thief grabbed Zhang by the throat. Just as they were about to begin searching for valuables, the maid stealthily slipped out the back and shouted, "Catch the thieves!" Upon hearing this, the four thieves, without managing to search for anything, fled. The thief with the gun fled out the front door, while the other three thieves escaped through the back door. One of the thieves, named Chen Hongsheng, from Pudong, was chased and caught by Shen Zhang and others at the entrance of the lane. The Chinese Detective Chief of the Gordon Road Police Station, Shen Chongli, and Bao Tan, were patrolling nearby, heard the commotion, and rushed to the scene. They arrested Chen. The thief with the gun was also seen fleeing by a passerby named Zhang, who helped to apprehend him, seizing a pistol with four bullets inside. He handed them over to the Western police. Both thieves were taken to the police station. They were interrogated and identified as Wang A'gen, from Changshu, who confessed that he and Chen Hongsheng were accomplices. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, explained the situation and requested a postponement. The plaintiff, Shen Zhang, also complained that both defendants were present at the scene. Wang held a gun and threatened her, while Chen grabbed her throat and demanded she hand over silver dollars. When questioned, the thieves confessed that the idea was initiated by the plaintiff's younger brother, named A'xiang. A'xiang used to work as a coppersmith at the tram company. Yesterday morning, he asked us to go to his sister's place to borrow money, and gave me a pistol. A'xiang himself was also behind us. When we arrived at the plaintiff's house, we were scared off by the maid's shouting, so we fled and were arrested. Chen confessed that he was being manipulated and didn't know they were going to rob. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Sun Yuan asked the plaintiff's husband, Shen Zhongfu, if he had a brother-in-law named A'xiang. Shen replied that A'xiang was indeed his wife's younger brother, a former worker at the French Concession Tram Company, who usually associated with lowlifes. He had repeatedly asked me to borrow money. I received a call from A'xiang at the company a few days ago, asking to borrow money again. I replied that if he wanted to borrow money, he could come to my house to discuss it, but he did not come. I did not expect this robbery to happen yesterday morning. I request a thorough investigation. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Sun ordered both defendants to be detained and adjourned the hearing for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e106">An Old Man Attempts Suicide in the Huangpu River <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fearing No One to Rely On in the Future</p>
<p>▲ Feeling It Better to Die Before His Son</p>
<p>▲ Fortunately Rescued by a Patrol Officer</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, an old man boarded a ferry from the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangtian Wharf to cross the Huangpu River. Upon reaching the middle of the river, the old man suddenly looked into the water and wept, then attempted to jump into the river to end his life. Quick-eyed passengers grabbed his legs, preventing him from falling into the water. After a short while, when the passengers were not paying attention, he tried to jump into the river again, but was again stopped by the passengers. The passengers strictly monitored him. At one point, they were momentarily distracted, and the old man tried to commit suicide for a third time, but was rescued again. The people, fearing that he would try again, tied the old man up inside the cabin with hemp rope. When the boat arrived at the Pudong Wharf, the boatman untied him and was about to hand him over to the patrol officer when the old man took the opportunity to jump into the river. He was floating up and down in the water. Fortunately, the boatmen made an effort to rescue him from the water and handed him over to the wharf patrol officer, who took him to the Third District General Office. After providing him with dry clothes, the district chief interrogated him. The old man, tearfully, said that his name was Dong Rongqing, 66 years old, from Tongzhou, living on Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. His luck had been bad this year. His four sons, the eldest, second, and third, had died one after another from illness. Recently, his youngest son had also fallen seriously ill, moaning in bed. The old man was unable to afford medical treatment for him. Seeing that his son's illness was not improving, if something else were to happen, he would not only have no money to buy a coffin for burial, but he would also have no one to rely on in the future. Thinking of the future, he felt a chill. Therefore, he decided that it would be better to die before his son. As he spoke, he was crying with tears, and his words were very sad. The district chief found his situation extremely pitiful and ordered him sent to the Public Security Bureau to find a way to help him.</p>

<p>It should be underwritten by purely Chinese-owned companies to maintain the relationship between labor and management and increase production efficiency. It is the only way to adjust the national economy and maintain social stability. Therefore, the Executive Yuan of the National Government has ordered all agencies to promote it separately, and it should be underwritten by purely Chinese-owned companies to prevent leaks. Recently, the Executive Yuan's No. 285 approved, "The request is approved for the purpose of adjusting the national economy and preventing leaks, and you should order all departments to promote it." It is suggested that if this insurance can be popularized in social groups and organizations, future labor-management disputes will have one more way to be resolved.</p>

<p>The Shanghai art community will host a public banquet for the famous artist Wang Yachen and his wife this afternoon. Two years ago, they traveled abroad together, touring Italy, France, England, Germany, Belgium, Russia, and other countries advanced in art, fully enjoying the delicacies of ancient and modern art gardens in Europe and the West before returning. Mr. Wang studied in Japan for many years, immersed himself in art, and became well-known in Shanghai for more than a decade. This time he traveled abroad to tour the north, and his ability to judge paintings and examine art is certainly different from ordinary people. This time, he copied more than 30 famous works from various major artists, from the Renaissance to Cezanne, forming a systematic organization, and plans to choose a suitable location to publicly exhibit them for the long-term study of the Shanghai art community. It is also heard that Mr. Wang and his wife also created many paintings during their travels in various countries. After moving, they also plan to jointly choose a place to exhibit them. This will be of great benefit to the future of the art community in our country, which is by no means trivial. Shanghai celebrities and colleagues in the art community have agreed to hold a dust-washing ceremony for Mr. Wang and his wife at the Yiyuan Yaji on Linyin Road in this city today (October 5th). When all the elites arrive, it will definitely be an unprecedented event in the Shanghai art scene.</p>

<p>Therefore, the new Buick drives more stably, is easier to drive, and is more comfortable to ride. Because of this, before the new Buick left the factory, people from all walks of life in Europe and the United States pre-ordered 7,000 vehicles upon hearing the news, worth 10 million gold. During the display, the number of ladies who visited in major cities was over 1.5 million, about 140,000 in New York, and even more in Chicago, close to 200,000, which can be said to be extremely grand. The large number of visitors from all walks of life at this display in Shanghai can be predicted. Because Buick cars have always been famous in Shanghai and are the crown of all cars, and today's new Buick is even more outstanding, people in Shanghai should be quick to see it first.</p>

<p>After the notorious criminal and bandit leader Jiang Jigui, who committed multiple murders, was arrested, the Shanghai Local Court prosecutor conducted an on-site investigation, filed a clear indictment, and sentenced him to death. The residents of Eastern Shanghai were overjoyed, believing that they could rest a little easier. However, on the 1st of this month, they saw in the newspaper that the criminal had appealed to the High Court, which overturned the original verdict and saved his life. The public was terrified. Among those murdered was Wu Yanyao, a fourth patrol officer of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Upon hearing this news, the chiefs and police officers of that precinct were unwilling to accept it. The criminal killed a public official, and the evidence was solid. If he is allowed to escape punishment, not only will the citizens be uneasy, but the lives of the city's 5,000+ chiefs and police officers will also be unprotected, which is very dangerous. Therefore, they jointly petitioned their superiors to protest the appeal and demand that the bandit leader be punished in order to redress the grievances and quiet the area.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Shanghai Bank Pioneers Sight Draft System <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, located at No. 9 Ningbo Road in this city, has always aimed to serve society and assist industry and commerce. It has been a pioneer in various new undertakings beneficial to society. For example, travel agencies, traveler's checks, gift certificates, savings deposits, etc., were all first initiated by the bank. To date, the effects have been remarkable, and society has found them convenient. It is recently heard that the bank, in view of the underdevelopment of industry and commerce in our country, due to the lack of popular use of negotiable instruments, has introduced European and American methods and pioneered the sight draft system. According to these measures, when merchants purchase goods, they can open a domestic documentary credit with the bank and give it to the seller. The seller can then issue a draft to the bank, along with the bill of lading, insurance policy, etc., and sell it to another bank. The bank can then accept the draft at the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. Once the draft has been accepted by the bank, it can be circulated in the market. Once it matures, it can be presented to the bank for payment. Also, a draft issued directly to the buyer by the seller can be discounted at the bank after it has been accepted by the buyer. This measure is of great benefit to the future of industry and commerce in our country. It is heard that the bank has printed detailed regulations, which will be sent upon request.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Henan Native Place Association in Shanghai Sends Telegram Urging Henan People to Govern Henan <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ Requesting the authorities to allocate funds for post-disaster relief</p>
<p>▲ And exempting excessive taxes and special taxes</p>
<p>The Henan Native Place Association in this city, initiated by Fan Zhengbo, Ren Hongjun, Duan Wengong, Wang Zepu, Jia Yusong, Chen Zikuan, Zhu Yaoting, and more than ten others, has already established a preparatory committee. All progress has been quite smooth. More than 600 people have joined the association, showing the need for unity and mutual welfare. The local Henan people in Shanghai have a unanimous demand. It is heard that the association, in view of the fact that the overall situation has been settled and Feng Yuxiang has stepped down, urgently needs to handle post-disaster relief to alleviate the suffering of the people of Henan. It has sent a telegram requesting the authorities to allocate funds for relief and exempt all excessive taxes and miscellaneous taxes. The last paragraph advocates that Henan people govern Henan, in order to ensure that the right people are in charge and that rapid progress is made. The words of the telegram are quite solemn. The following is recorded: To the Central Party Headquarters of the Nationalist Party in Nanjing, the National Government's various ministries, the Party Headquarters of various provinces, the governments of various provinces, the Party Headquarters of various special municipalities, the governments of various municipalities, and all newspapers nationwide: Since the founding of the Republic of China nineteen years ago, wars have been frequent and there has been no peaceful year. In addition to continuous famines, people have been displaced. The old and weak are left in ditches, and the young and strong become bandits. Henan, located in the Central Plains and connecting north and south, has suffered the most from wars. This time, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang waged war and ravaged the entire region even more severely. Wherever artillery fire reached, pavilions were reduced to ruins. Harsh government policies have extracted the marrow from our bones. We cannot seek life, nor can we seek death. This situation is unbearable. Which of us local Henan people in Shanghai does not have parents or siblings? Looking afar at our homeland, our hearts are with our fellow villagers. We only see the tragic atmosphere filling the sky and hear the sounds of moaning filling our ears. Whenever the moon is bright and the wind is clear, we cannot help but look up, beat our chests, and weep blood. Now, fortunately, the overall situation has been settled, the rebellious forces have been eliminated, the war has ended, and peace can be expected. If we can live in peace and work together to sing the praises of prosperity, it will not only be what hundreds of millions of people in Henan are praying for, but also what we local Henan people in Shanghai are longing for day and night. However, although the suffering of war has ended, the wounds of the people have not yet healed. If we do not plan for post-disaster relief, we will only be prolonging our lives. We deeply hope that the governing authorities will consider the suffering of the people and allocate funds for relief, and exempt all excessive taxes and special taxes imposed by the rebel Feng Yuxiang in Henan. We also ask that the various taxes collected by the Central Government be reduced in consideration of the special circumstances, so that the people of Henan can recover and the vitality can be restored. This is the first request that we ask the authorities to adopt when handling post-disaster relief. Moreover, there is something that cannot be left unsaid. Henan Province has repeatedly experienced disasters, and the need for recuperation and recovery cannot be delayed. Only with the right people in charge can we deal with the situation properly. Although Henan people governing Henan may inevitably have some fixed views, we fear that it will be difficult to achieve rapid progress if we only scratch the surface. Therefore, when handling post-disaster relief, we should select people who are familiar with the suffering of the people to take charge of the Henan situation. No one is better than a Henan person. This humble opinion is not intended to cling to localism, but rather to quickly relieve the suffering of the people. We urge the governing authorities to resolutely adopt this proposal and hope that local Henan people and compatriots across the country will unite to support it and respond with sympathy. It will be a great fortune for the people of Henan and a great fortune for the whole country. We send this telegram urgently and cannot express all that we wish to say. We respectfully submit this proposal for your consideration. Respectfully, The Henan Native Place Association in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance's Office in Shanghai received a telegram from Fujian Commander Liu, which read: Urgent. Honorable Minister Song, with respect. I have received your telegram with respect.

<h3 id="e123">This Year's Exports to the United States are Sluggish <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reports that according to statistics from the US Consulate General, China's national exports to the United States in August decreased by another US$3 million compared to July. The total value was US$5,900,454, while it was US$8,512,373 in July. Compared to US$13,234,854 in the same period last year, it has decreased by more than half. The total value of exports to the United States in the first eight months of this year was US$80,880,896, a decrease of approximately US$36 million compared to US$116,753,371 in the same period last year. This shows that this year's exports to the United States are sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Adding Parks <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the proposal to add parks was discussed again at the regular meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors this Wednesday. According to a letter from the British military commander of the Shanghai area, the landlord of the site of a barracks and training ground rented by a certain British military battalion is about to sell the land. The letter asked if the Shanghai Municipal Council could purchase the land so that it could continue to be rented to the military for stationing. The land was originally in the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to add parks, so the proposal was discussed together. One director first stated that the Board of Directors had previously resolved that the first priority for adding parks should be in the northern district. The Director-General replied that the area near Jiaozhou Road barracks is developing rapidly, and most of the residents are factory workers. There is currently no public place for recreation, so it is necessary to add a park. The Director-General then sought the opinion of the Acting Chief Accountant, who stated that the land price is approximately 800,000 taels. If it is to be purchased, either other investments this year must be postponed, or the Shanghai Municipal Council must sell its remaining land to allocate funds for this expense. The funds from the sale of the Electricity Department that can be used for investment are only 2.7 million taels. It was previously resolved to use them for investment over four years. The use of funds for the past two years has already been planned and cannot be allocated for the expense of adding parks. As for the remaining land owned by the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is difficult to dispose of it before the expansion plans for various bureaus and departments are decided, determining which to keep and which to sell. After detailed consideration by the directors, opinions varied. Two directors strongly advocated purchasing as soon as possible when an opportunity arises, as the land price will only increase the later it is purchased. Other directors advocated continuing with the original plan. Finally, it was decided to postpone the purchase of land and review the financial situation when preparing the 1931 budget. For the time being, the Director of Public Works was ordered to negotiate a lease renewal with the owner of the barracks to avoid the British military having to move the barracks.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau Reforms the Boundary between the French Concession and Zhabei <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau recently found that the maps and boundaries of the Huajie District and Zhabei District are very inconsistent and urgently need to be reformed to unify them. For the sake of reorganization, the eastern part of the 28th Bao, 3rd Tu, and the southern part of the 4th Tu, and the eastern 18th Tu and 19th Tu of the former Pusong District were划入 (incorporated) into the Huajie District area. Thus, the boundary of the Huajie District will be: east to the boundary line of the Special District, south to Xinpu Huijitang, west to Huo Bilan Road, west to Shangao Pond, and north to the Wusong River. As for the Zhabei District, the land of the 12th Tu of the 27th Bao of the former Zhabei District, its western part is adjacent to the Pusong District, and its eastern part happens to be the confluence of the Wusong River and the Tanzi River, which completely isolates it from the entire topography of the Zhabei District. This Tu has been incorporated into the Pusong District, and the rest remains the old boundary. It is heard that the bureau has drawn the old map Bao boundary map of the two districts, and the corrected map boundary map, and submitted them to the municipal government for record.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Deadline for Technician Certificate Exchange Approaching <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The municipal government ordered the bureau to announce that the deadline for technicians in various places who obtained certificates in accordance with the single-line regulations for technician registration of local governments before the implementation of the Technician Registration Law, and those who passed the technician screening of the former Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and obtained certificates, to exchange their certificates, had previously been extended by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines, approved by the Executive Yuan, from April 11 to October 11 of this year, for six months. This deadline is fast approaching. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that the number of people who have exchanged their certificates in accordance with the regulations is still limited. In order to respect the rights of the people and to remind those in various places who are eligible to exchange their certificates, a special consultation has been made to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct the主管 (responsible) official departments to announce this matter so that they will not be unable to exchange their certificates after the deadline. It is learned that the municipal government of this city has also received this consultation recently and has instructed the Bureau of Public Works to investigate and handle the matter.</p>

<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reports that tomorrow (the 5th) is the 20th anniversary of the deposition of the former King Manuel of Portugal and the establishment of the Republic. The 3,300 Portuguese侨民 (overseas residents) in this city will hold a grand celebration.

The current president is General Camona, but the public mostly looks to Minister of Finance Oliveira as the center of the government. Oliveira is gifted with financial management skills, maintaining finances and balancing the budget, which is unmatched by previous ministers of finance.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Resolution of Dispute over Tobacco and Alcohol Merchants' Treasury Bonds <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol merchants in the Chinese area of this city were ordered by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to solicit subscriptions for the 19-year short-term customs treasury bonds. It is heard that the industry has been required to subscribe directly and indirectly several times. Small businesses find it difficult to comply. The Second District of Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office also带徵 (levies along with) the industry, levying 8% of the annual license tax, which is collected along with the winter license collection this year. It has been implemented since the 1st of this month. When the industry went to pay, the office did not issue treasury bonds or receipts. It only stamped the license with a seal indicating that the treasury bonds had been collected. The merchants found this procedure inappropriate. The tobacco兑 (exchange) industry went to the union to request representatives to negotiate. At 8:00 AM yesterday, Chen Kunxian, Yang Bingyi, and other representatives went to the collection office. Director Yang received them. The representatives stated their opinions and were promised compliance. The following was drafted: (1) When paying taxes, 8% of the annual tax should be levied uniformly and collected along with the winter license tax this year, to be paid in full by the 10th of this month. (2) The collected treasury bonds, regardless of amount, should be issued with treasury bond receipts by the collection office, and cancelled with a stamp. (3) Those who paid the license treasury bonds on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd but did not receive treasury bond receipts can bring their licenses to the office to receive补领 (supplementary) treasury bond receipts. (4) All treasury bond receipts from the collection office should be submitted to the union, which will issue a代存 (temporary storage) receipt to facilitate the aggregation of the total amount and exchange for official treasury bonds from the collection office so that they can be returned. (5) The established method should be communicated by the collection office to the union, and by the union to the industry.</p>

<p>Distribution to all sectors in this city and gifting to colleagues of the Shanghai Telegraph General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications nationwide: The Dianxia Art Association, organized by the Shanghai Telegraph General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, will soon be five years old since its establishment. The association is purely an art research group. Its public performances of national skills, Peking Opera, etc., have been widely praised by all sectors. This year's New Year's Day, in addition to holding a celebration, the association printed 8,000 copies of the 4th Anniversary Collection, which were distributed to various administrative agencies, groups, and sectors nationwide. Because the collection was gifted and distributed nationwide, reaching far and wide, major newspapers such as Shen, Xin, Shi, and Shishi, which had never advertised on other books or newspapers, also specially made zinc plates to publish full-page advertisements on the anniversary collection. This was truly unprecedented. Other well-known national goods stores in this city, such as Sanyou Industrial Co., Samsung Cotton Iron Factory, Commercial Press, Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Co., China Chemical Industry Co., Shanghai Bank, China Travel Service, Lao Jiuhe Silk Shop, Sanji Electric Company, etc., also actively published advertisements in the association's collection. This is because the anniversary collection is gifted even to remote areas such as Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and the three northeastern provinces, and its effectiveness is far superior to that of other books and newspapers that require payment. The association's 5th anniversary will be held on New Year's Day in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and it has been decided to expand the size of the 5th Anniversary Collection. In view of the haste in publishing the 4th Anniversary Collection, many large companies requesting to publish advertisements were unable to do so. Therefore, preparations have been made in advance to start compiling and printing, and it is planned to print an additional 2,000 copies, totaling 10,000 copies, to be widely distributed nationwide. As there are numerous companies in Shanghai and it is impossible to contact them all, there may be some who regret missing the opportunity. Therefore, a Dianxia 5th Anniversary Collection Advertising Office (telephone 10196) has been established at No. 51 Sichuan Road, the association's office, to facilitate contact with major companies.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Greetings. Upon investigation, the news item concerning the Zhenru International Radio Communication Station, translated and published in your newspaper on the 4th of this month, as carried in a Mainland newspaper on the 3rd, is completely inconsistent with the facts. In addition to sending a letter to the Mainland newspaper for correction, we hereby issue the following statement: (1) The International Radio Communication Station being established by the Ministry of Communications has one American-style and one French-style shortwave radio transmitter each. All payments for the equipment have been made in installments. All construction matters are specifically planned and carried out by the Preparatory Office for the International Radio Communication Station, organized by the Ministry of Communications. All staff members of this office are domestic personnel appointed by the Ministry, and no foreigners are involved. (2) Both the American and French radio companies have dispatched commercial representatives and consulting engineers to Shanghai for consultation on all matters. However, they are all in an advisory capacity and have no direct authority or management rights. (3) For the convenience of international communications, the Ministry of Communications has signed service agreements with American, French, and German radio companies. The principle is that all radio telegrams from our country to European and American countries will be delivered or relayed by these companies, and all radio telegrams from European and American countries to our country will be delivered by our radio station. The sharing of telegraphic fees is separately agreed upon and mutually settled, with equal benefits as the guiding principle. The Sino-American service agreement is valid for ten years. (4) In order to seek independence in international communications, our country has purchased equipment from American and French radio companies to build its own radio stations. There is absolutely no such thing as the American company funding the construction and undertaking it for ten years, as reported by the Mainland newspaper. If it were as described, how could the Ministry of Communications propose to various submarine cable companies to cancel the existing exclusive contracts? The above four points are requested to be published in your newspaper's "Letters to the Editor" column, so that the people of the country may understand the truth and not be confused by foreign propaganda, thereby thwarting their imperialist conspiracies. We would be most fortunate.</p>
<p>With respectful greetings,</p>
<p>Preparatory Office for the International Radio Communication Station, Ministry of Communications</p>

<h3 id="e143">Jiangsu Education Finance Committee Meeting <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Concrete measures to reorganize education fees and tax revenues. All agencies must raise sufficient funds to pay off debts within ten days. Request the Provincial Government to order county finance bureaus not to misappropriate funds. The Jiangsu Education Finance Committee, urgently needing to discuss measures to address the continued arrears in education fees for this year, convened a meeting at the Education Department at 3:00 PM on the 1st of this month. Committee members Wu Zhihui, Niu Tiesheng, Ye Chucang, Chen Hexian, Zhang Naiyan, Wang Maozu, Liu Zhiwei, Gao Yang, Ma Ketan, and others attended the meeting in full. Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education sent a representative, Wu Yan Yin, and Director Chen of the Finance Department also sent a representative. Chairman Niu reported that many important matters were decided during the discussions, which are summarized as follows: Regarding the reorganization of education fees and tax revenues, after detailed discussions by the committee members, concrete measures were developed. Regarding how to raise and allocate funds for the arrears in expenses for July, August, and September for provincial education institutions, it was generally agreed that the schools were in dire need of funds, and that it was essential to raise and allocate funds as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs. Therefore, it was resolved that the managing office should quickly borrow from banks and various counties and allocate the funds as soon as possible within ten days, and that in order to take into account the most urgent needs of the schools, a portion of the funds should be raised and allocated within three days. It was also agreed to nominate Director Chen of the Finance Department, President Zhang of the Central University, and Director Chen of the Education Department to jointly negotiate. Furthermore, as there were still cases of misappropriation of funds among counties, even though the division of education funds had been implemented, it was resolved that the Education Department should consult with the Provincial Government and the Finance Department to order the county finance bureaus not to misappropriate any education funds, regardless of the item of expenditure, and to strictly implement the division of grain transport fees. In addition, regarding the two vacancies for inspectors, it was resolved to appoint Qi Yong and Ren Zhongmin to fill the positions. In many counties, the salt tax was not divided in the same way as the grain transport fees. It was resolved to request the Finance Department to issue a notice to the county finance bureaus to divide the funds in accordance with the grain transport fees. There were many other important matters, which cannot all be recorded. The meeting adjourned after 9:00 PM. Committee members Wu Zhihui and Niu Tiesheng made time to come from Nanjing to Zhenjiang to preside over the meeting, as it was of great importance. They immediately returned to Nanjing that night, but as the meeting adjourned too late, they had to take the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight train back this morning. During the meeting, all committee members were unusually spirited.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Joint Meeting of Ministries and the Academy Regarding Foreigners Coming to China for Scientific Research <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica and the Ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs, Politics, Education, and other ministries held a joint meeting on the 2nd at 10:00 AM at the Ministry of Education regarding foreigners coming to China for scientific research. Those present included Li Huaying of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Xu Shoushang of the Academia Sinica, Wu Sishan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhu Ying of the Ministry of Interior, Liu Mingxun of the Ministry of Interior, Chen Shizhen of the Ministry of Education, Zhu Baoqin of the Ministry of Education, Peng Baichuan of the Ministry of Education. The meeting was chaired by Chen Shizhen. The Chairman reported that the Ministry of Education had recently received notifications from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding foreign organizations intending to come to China for research, including: (1) Robert B. Ekelberry and others from the United States going to Xinjiang to conduct scientific research; (2) Rickmers of Germany bringing weapons to Xinjiang to measure and study glaciers and geological resources; and (3) Smith of the United States bringing weapons to Yunnan and Guizhou provinces to investigate animals. The opinions of the Academia Sinica and the Peiping Antiquities Preservation Committee had been sought, and both had responded (details omitted). However, as these foreigners are going deep into the interior for scientific research, which is of great importance to the country, it is necessary to discuss appropriate measures carefully in order to respect sovereignty. Therefore, the Academia Sinica and relevant ministries were invited to meet to develop a proper plan. The points to be discussed today are approximately two: (1) Whether or not the above three cases should be allowed to enter the country for research; (2) If they are allowed to enter the country, what conditions should be set? Please express your opinions.</p>
<p>Results of the discussion: (1) The case of Robert B. Ekelberry and others from the United States going to Xinjiang for scientific research and the case of Rickmers of Germany bringing weapons to Xinjiang to measure and study glaciers and geological resources were discussed together and it was answered that they should be postponed temporarily. The reason is that the existing Northwest Scientific Expedition Team is conducting a survey in Xinjiang and has not yet completed it. After the team completes the survey and reports the results, a plan will be determined. (2) The case of Smith and others from the Chicago Museum of Natural History organizing an animal survey was approved for entry, and the conditions were to be decided by the Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education. However, before entering the country, the following items must be notified to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer and compliance: 1. The team must first submit a detailed plan for animal research (the areas passed through, the round-trip route, etc. must be explained) and send it through the embassy to the government for review by the competent authorities. 2. A brief list of the number of team members. 3. Weapons are allowed to be carried according to the number opened in the previous letter from the American Minister James, but the passport must be verified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and transferred to the Ministry of Military Affairs for approval to issue a license to carry weapons. 4. Surveying equipment is not allowed to be carried. 5. China sends personnel to participate in the survey. 6. Half of the collected specimens shall belong to China for commemoration. The only item without a duplicate shall be left to China. After the team signs all the conditions, the Yunnan and Guizhou provincial governments should be consulted for verification before entering the country. (3) Regarding the matters of foreigners coming to China to conduct scientific research in the future, the Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education will formulate unified measures, and then invite relevant ministries to meet and pass them.</p>

<p>Talent Emerges, Emphasis on Practice</p>
<p>As Mr. Qiu Feihai, a Chinese tennis national athlete, is about to tour Europe, he has specially written "The Future of Chinese Tennis," based on his observations, to be published in this newspaper. It is recorded below. Since the 8th Far Eastern Games held in 1926, lawn tennis in China has made rapid progress. Currently, it has become one of the most popular sports in various universities and amateur sports circles. Tennis clubs have been established one after another, and their number is not small. The large number of spectators at each competition is enough to show the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for this sport. The China National Amateur Athletic Federation has also been organizing various competitions every year, promoting and encouraging them with all its might. Looking at the rate of progress in recent years, it is not difficult to believe that China will soon be able to compete with others in the world of tennis.</p>
<p>At present, our country has many promising young tennis players, such as Zheng Zhaojia of St. John's University, Yu Tianguang of Shanghai University, and countless other strong players that I have seen in previous competitions. In the near future, they will all stand out in the tennis world and win glory for the country. These players all have the potential to win championships, what they need is experience, which can be gained by participating in more competitions and competing with those who are better than them. This sport should be started at a young age, and beginners should pay attention to the accuracy of their grip, stance, and stroke. It is advisable to first ask for guidance from famous coaches, or read more of the works of world tennis master Tilden, and then start practicing. If you have no idea about these three, please do not try it lightly, because once you go astray, it will be difficult to turn back, and only a small fraction of those who can correct it later will succeed. If you can follow the correct posture from the beginning, and then practice without interruption, you will definitely become a good tennis player. However, if you want to surpass others, it still depends on your talent, because tennis is not just about hitting the ball, but also requires a soft touch, courage, patience, strength, and strategy.</p>
<p>Japanese tennis has now surpassed all other countries in the Far East and is comparable to world-class players. The reason why they have reached this position is largely due to the encouragement and support of their people, providing various conveniences to young players. For example, universities and other sports centers all have good tennis courts, which is of great benefit to the progress of their skills. If they are always confined to poor tennis courts, it will lead to bad habits in their strokes and timing. In addition, their sports organizations encourage competitions between clubs, send teams to visit overseas, and invite world-famous players to perform in Japan for learning purposes, all of which are aimed at promoting rapid progress in tennis skills.</p>
<p>Chinese tennis is still in its infancy, but looking at the remarkable progress in recent years and the efforts of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation to encourage competitions, it is expected that first-class talents who will win world tennis championships will be produced in the future.</p>

<p>| Yesterday's 3-1 Victory Over Lide |</p>
<p>A Group: Biao Wins Against Qiu Feihai 2-1... The singles finals of the A and B groups of the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Tournament continued today. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 2:00 PM, they were held one after another at the French Chamber of Commerce. More than a thousand Chinese and foreign spectators watched, which was a grand occasion. The B group competed first, ending at 2:15 PM. As a result, Yu Tianguang defeated Lide 3-1 to win the B group championship. In the A group, Qiu Feihai and Biao fought for three sets, but the sky gradually darkened, making it difficult to continue the match. It was changed to continue at the same location at 3:00 PM this afternoon. As of yesterday's score, Biao was ahead 2-1. The final victory will depend on the efforts of the two.</p>
<h3 id="e154">(2) Yu Tianguang Wins B Group Championship <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's 3-1 Victory Over Lide. Yu Tianguang is a rising star in the tennis world and is recognized as a future talent in our country. Since participating in the Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Singles B Group competition, he has won every battle and has been invincible. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the French Chamber of Commerce, he competed with Lide for the championship. The young hero lived up to his name. In the four-set bloody battle, the experienced and skilled Lide abandoned his troops and surrendered to the tennis racket, acknowledging him as his superior.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Bloody Battle <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Lide's victory in the first set was mainly due to his net play. Yu Tianguang lacked experience, which led to helplessness. Although he tried hard to catch up, he was too far behind and was defeated. In the second set, both sides struggled hard. At first, Lide rose sharply, with a rapid momentum. Later, Yu strengthened his resolve and advanced, turning danger into safety and winning. Yu took advantage of the victory to sweep the army and seized the victory in the third set. In the fourth set, they advanced together, evenly matched. After 4-4, Yu took the upper hand. Before long, he took the lead with 5-4. In the last game, he relied on two fierce serves to complete the great feat of winning the singles championship. The audience cheered and laughed, filling the air, to congratulate him on his future efforts.</p>
<p>Yu Tianguang (3...6 8...6 6...2 6...4) Lide</p>
<h3 id="e156">(2) A Group Continues the Final Today <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Qiu Feihai vs. Biao Was Not Finished | Biao Leads 2-1</p>
<p>In the first set, the situation was unpredictable. In the fierce battle, Qiu started to fight back, but the situation was unfavorable. He lost three games in a row, like blinking an eye. Before long, he changed his strategy, repeatedly using near and far hits to confuse the opponent. He seized the fourth game for himself. However, Biao was full of energy, hitting the ball straight and backhand, advancing with momentum. Qiu's solid defense line was shaken again, losing two games in a row, falling behind 1-5. Looking at the future, it was frightening and unimaginable. But then the situation suddenly turned, and the situation changed. Qiu's lifelong skills were fully developed at this time. First, he used unpredictable tricks to disrupt the enemy's morale, and then he took the opportunity to attack directly, gaining advantages step by step, and winning back the seventh and eighth games. Before long, he won the ninth game in one go. Biao was panicked, and the tenth game was also taken by Qiu. The scores of both sides were 5-5, and the audience's emotions were tense. The eleventh game was a fierce struggle, which was rare before. The battle made the Chinese and English players red-faced and breathless. The number of draws was seen six times, making Qiu exhausted. Biao took the opportunity to advance, and the result of the game turned into his hand. In the twelfth game, Biao was still strong and won in one go. Biao won the first set with 7-5. The ups and downs of this set were unpredictable. Qiu's major blow was the loss of the first three games. In the critical eleventh game, he failed to win again due to insufficient physical strength, so he ultimately failed.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Second Set, Failure to Achieve Success <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai's performance in the second set was indeed wonderful, earning the praise of the audience. At the beginning, they advanced together, without distinction, after 2-2, Qiu moved like a rabbit and was as quiet as a virgin, rising sharply and taking the lead with 5-2. However, Biao had amazing skills, winning five games in a row, causing Qiu Feihai to sigh that he had failed to achieve success. In the first game, Qiu won with a skillful four-point victory. The second game was attributed to Biao. The third and fourth games were also won by each. From the fifth game onwards, Qiu was vigorous, whether forehand or backhand, he always made the first move. In the sixth game, it was even more miraculous. Biao completely lost his ability to resist, being directed by his racket. In the seventh game, Qiu escaped from death three or four times, and the result of the victory created a 5-2 advantage. Later, Biao's energy suddenly increased, and his fierce straight shots were like holding a thousand troops and horses, making it difficult to resist, and then he took the eighth game. In the ninth game, Qiu met the opportunity to complete the great feat of winning a set, but he saw that things went against his wishes and fell into the hands of the enemy again. The biggest reason was that his physical strength was inferior to others. Under despair, Biao gradually entered a better state, which made him energetic and completed the last three games in one breath, and also won the second set with 7-5.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Third Set, Last Effort <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>In the first twelve games of the third set, the victory belonged to the one who served. Although Qiu's serve was weak, it was quite tortuous. The enemy made a fierce advance, but was caught in the trap. This set was of great importance. If Biao won, the championship was certain. If Qiu won, there would be a turning point. Therefore, even in a state of exhaustion, they still worked hard to fight, not daring to relax a step. Qiu took advantage of the convenience of serving first, taking the lead in each game, while Biao followed closely, inseparable. So there was a tie of 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, and even 6-6. In the last two games, Qiu always dealt with it with soft skills, while Biao's temper rose, and his shots lost their grip. Qiu then won the third set with 8-6, and got the opportunity to continue the game today.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Skills of the Two Heroes of China and Japan <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Biao's tactics are the same, both standing at the baseline and hitting around from left to right. There is no sight of interceptions and volleys. Both have powerful straight shots, but Biao is slightly stronger. There are no mistakes in the backhand shots, but Qiu has more changes. In addition, Biao is good at strength, while Qiu is good at strategy. As for temper, Qiu has been completely restrained, while Biao inevitably commits it from time to time. When the game continues this afternoon, if Qiu can move forward after a quick pull, the opponent may have the trouble of taking care of one thing and losing sight of another.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Thrilling Speedway Racing at Weile Garden <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai often have a tendency to follow trends. No matter what it is, as long as it is new and interesting, once it is spread, everyone will flock to it. Circuses and crab-backed beauties have become a thing of the past. The most sensational thing now is the bicycle race at Weile Garden. The usually deserted Haig Road has been transformed into a place of bustling traffic. Last week, my friends and I also went to visit, and I felt that there were several points worth recording.</p>
<p>The Uniqueness of the Track The tracks of ordinary track and field competitions are flat, while the tracks of Weile Garden are sloped. The slope varies, some are 45 degrees, and some steep places are even about 70 degrees. All are made of thin wooden boards, which are exceptionally smooth. It is truly unique.</p>
<p>The Initiator's Martyrdom It is said that the initiator of Weile Garden was a Dutchman. He was able to ride extremely fast motorbikes on high-sloped tracks. But once, when he was testing his skills, because of the high speed, he involuntarily rushed up and fell from a height of more than thirty feet, and died.</p>
<p>The Referee Injured That day, there was a Japanese, a Chinese, and an Annamese competing in motorbike racing. In the last lap, everyone tried their best to drive fast. The Japanese saw that he was catching up with the Annamese. I don't know what carelessness it was, but the motorbike rolled straight down and happened to hit a Japanese referee. At that moment, the person's face turned pale and he fell to the ground unable to speak. The person in the car was also injured.</p>
<p>Dangerously Crushed This kind of racing is indeed very dangerous. When it comes to the thrilling moment, everyone really sweats for them. Once, three Westerners competed in motorbikes. I don't know what happened, but the car suddenly left the body and the person fell on the track. Taking advantage of the situation, he also fell several feet away. He quickly climbed down. Fortunately, a car came from behind like a whirlwind. If he was only one second late leaving the track, he would have been crushed. How dangerous! However, this Westerner, although injured from the fall, still got up and drove around the track. His spirit of a strong man is admirable after all. The audience gave a full house of applause.</p>
<p>Particularly Fat Body Most of the actors are very fat. Later, I found out that it was to prevent falls. So they put some soft things inside their clothes. There were also things to protect the head, so they felt particularly swollen. It was only finished at five o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Cheng Yanqiu and Wang Shaolou <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Master Kan Yun Lou</p>
<p>When I was young, I watched Huiban operas. There was no such thing as a grand finale or a grand finale. There was no such thing as a lead role or a supporting role. There was also no such thing as a headliner or a second-rate acrobat who played a dragon. (Although there is this term for playing a dragon, good actors often take on the role.) But in Beijing operas, the boundaries are clear and the status is very different. This is even more so today. The cooperation between Mei and Yang, and the cooperation between Yu and Yang, cannot last for long. Mei and Yu cannot be seen in joint performances except for private shows. Even second-rate old men are unwilling to be vassals of female roles. And second-rate female roles are also unwilling to be attendants of old men. Therefore, in recent years, the flat-rate south tour has failed because they cannot carry a suitable supporting role. Even if he is as virtuous as Shu Yan, his plays such as "Visiting Mother and Assassinating Tang" are still not popular because the listeners have the regret of only being able to listen to half of the play.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu has toured Shanghai and has achieved good results. The two words "Cheng cavity" are enough to be immortal alongside Tan's tune. However, the people who sing Cheng cavity today only sing a few plays such as "Scolding the Palace" and "Golden Lock Record". I have not seen anyone imitate his "Wujiapo", "Fenhe Bay", "Mulberry Garden Meeting", "Imperial Stele Pavilion", and "Lotus Lantern". I don't know that Yanqiu has made careful studies on these plays. However, "Scolding the Palace" and "Golden Lock" are solo plays for Qingyi, so listeners will naturally be pleased. The Fenhe and Mulberry Garden plays emphasize both Sheng and Dan roles. When Yanqiu performed in the past, the old men were not up to par, so the good points were all overshadowed. Therefore, those who talk about Cheng cavity only know about "Scolding the Palace", "Golden Lock", and "Wenji Returning to Han".</p>
<p>Yanqiu once co-starred with Shuyan in "Visiting Mother and Assassinating Tang" at Gongwu Stage. The popularity was unprecedented. It can be seen that with proper matching, any play can be attractive. Yanqiu and Shuyan both have creations in the opera world and have similar status. The tunes of the two are also very suitable. I often think to myself that if Yanqiu and Shuyan can cooperate for a long time, they will definitely be able to promote many old plays. However, in reality, it is impossible to realize. Now Shuyan is ill and has not been on stage for a long time. Those who love Yu's tune only tend to Wang Shaolou. He has not been on stage for a long time. He is young, talented, and beautiful. He imitates Shuyan in singing and acting and can get his spirit. This time, following Yanqiu to the south, not only the plays "Qionglin Feast", "Losing Jieting", "Dingjun Mountain", and "Nanyang Pass" will be enough to satisfy the people of Shanghai, but also "Wujiapo", "Fenhe Bay", "Lotus Lantern", and "Imperial Stele Pavilion" can add to Yanqiu's brilliance. Cheng and Yu's cooperation, this wish is ultimately empty. Having Shaolou as a match is already satisfactory. Peonies and green leaves complement each other. I am deeply pleased for Yanqiu to have found someone. The Mulberry Garden and Fenhe plays will become popular all over the world from now on. It is also a good phenomenon for the revival of old plays.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Talking About Crabs <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Gui</p>
<p>In the clear autumn, the crabs are fat and the flowers are yellow. It is the time to hold a crab and drink wine. The Nanjing Road World Show is in line with the times, and there is a display of crab-backed beauties for people to watch, which is a feast for the eyes. The people in Shanghai can see what they have never seen before. What a happy thing it is. It is a pity that the crab beauty is too small in size. Although she has a beautiful face, the viewers are not clear about it. It is a pity to cover up the beauty. If it can be covered with a microscope and magnified, then the true face of Mount Lu will be in sight.</p>
<p>The world is so big that there is nothing strange. Is it just revealing a crab beauty? In my opinion, there are two strange crabs. One, in Hengzhou East Township, there are crabs as big as washbasins. Whenever it rains, they roam the ridges and fields. They are covered with hairy whiskers, and their backs are green. They are not seen when the weather is clear. At first, some villagers caught them, but their hands were stabbed by the whiskers and the pain was like a knife cut. They had to release them and the pain stopped. Therefore, they respected them as divine crabs. According to the elders, it is said that they heard from their ancestors that this crab has lived for more than five hundred years and has seen all the vicissitudes of life. Now no one dares to catch them, and so on. In 1926, the Revolutionary Army marched north. Some soldiers stationed in Dongxiang saw the crabs and killed them with bayonets, cooked them and ate them. Their taste was extremely fresh, which was beyond the reach of ordinary crabs. Alas, the five-hundred-year-old crab was actually killed by soldiers. What a misfortune! One was in the suburbs of Suzhou. I went for a walk with my friend Xu Zibu. Where the green grass moved, a crab walked out horizontally. At first, I thought it was an ordinary crab. Then I saw that when it moved, its feet stretched upwards and hugged its waist tightly. Xu Zibu smiled and said, "This is a dancing crab." This crab has horns about an inch long on its head. The horns are now in four colors: yellow, white, black, and red, which are dazzling. I wanted to catch it and take it back for appreciation. Xu Zibu was very superstitious and said that since things have strange appearances, they must have the attachment of gods. So I didn't catch it. The above two crabs and the crab beauty displayed in the New World can be called three strange crabs.</p>
<p>In the past, a certain tycoon had a crab recipe that described the method of cooking crabs in forty-six kinds. Unfortunately, I am forgetful. If I can remember the details and write them down here, it will definitely be what the gluttons want to hear. I only remember one section: use crab roe to cook cabbage and seep chicken soup. Its taste is rich and refreshing.</p>

<p>— Bing Mei</p>
<p>Another new autumn has arrived easily in a year. Recently, there is one thing worth mentioning in the Shanghai music scene, that is, the Star Opera Troupe, which has a good reputation, will hold its third rehearsal on Double Ten Festival. After the solicitation meeting ended, the president Zhou Jianyun, Wang Yushu, Zheng Zhengqiu and other gentlemen, because of the satisfactory results, became more interested and spent more than five thousand gold to purchase a complete set of costumes. Therefore, the costumes worn on the stage this time are dazzling and can make the male and female stars shine more brightly. It is said that the fixed repertoire is both civil and military, and it is quite wonderful. There will be a "Great Blessing" at the opening. The God of Longevity, Zhang Xian, the Heavenly Official and the boy and girl roles in the play will be played by Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhou Jianyun, Wang Yushu and more than twenty male and female members respectively. And the director Zhang Shichuan's "Cowherd" is even more interesting. This is truly a unique creation in the music scene and a good story in the silver sea. The theater is still in the company's photography studio. The performance time is calculated from afternoon to noon, which lasts for more than ten hours. The detailed repertoire is attached as follows.</p>
<p>Twenty-three members of the troupe will perform ("Great Blessing") Jing Liting ("Li Ling Stele") Hu Tiwei, Zhou Yihua ("Killing a Daughter-in-law") Huang Zhuxuan, Huang Lingxuan, Tang Jie ("Famen Temple") Gu Mei, Xu Zhiren, Luo Wuya ("Battle of Puguan") Ying Shaomei ("Drunken Concubine") Dong Tianya, Xie Yunqing ("Phoenix Mountain") Gu Youmin, Gong Jianong, Wang Yuanlong ("Two Volumes of Rainbow Pass") Ma Yinzhi, Wang Jiting ("Stealing the Imperial Scroll") Xu Xinfu, Wu Wanxiang, Dong Tianya, Tang Jie ("Four Jie Village") Zhou Jianyun, Yun Wen, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Yun Yu ("Complete Imperial Stele Pavilion") Wang Yushu, Su Wan, Tang Jie ("Entering the Palace Twice") Hu Die, Xia Peizhen, Gao Hanying ("Visiting Relatives and Quarrelling") Zheng Zhengqiu, Wang Yuanlong, Yan Chonglou, Tan Zhiyuan ("Heroes' Gathering")</p>
<p>News from the Art World Mr. Guan Futin of Runzhou has been living in seclusion in Shanghai since he retired from the government in the first year of the Republic of China, and has been entertaining himself with painting. His works imitate the Song and Yuan dynasties, from shallow to deep, from fine to rough, following step by step, and have reached a state of perfection. He has been studying hard for more than twenty years. This time, Mr. Chu Minyi was ordered to go to Belgium to set up a Chinese Pavilion and took three masterpieces of Guan Jun for foreigners who like the essence of the country to appreciate. Those from all walks of life who want to get Guan Jun's paintings have a fixed price. The major stationery and fan shops in Shanghai can send letters to inquire.</p>
<p>News from the Publishing World The Sanmin Company at the end of North Sichuan Road has newly published a book "Questions and Answers on Chinese Literature," which was compiled by Mr. Qian Shiyun. The content is divided into elementary school, classics, philosophy, history, art, ancient prose and vernacular prose, novels and dramas, and other catalogs. The categories are classified and collected to be the richest. The end is attached to the list of books approved by Mr. Liang Rengong and Hu Shizhi, so that it can be a shortcut for beginners to get started. Mr. Zou Jiugai, an old man in Liangxi Bayi, also wrote a preface for it.</p>
<h3 id="e165">New Knowledge of the Family <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng Editor</p>
<p>As soon as the autumn wind rises, ordinary people's skin feels dry, mostly due to anemia. The skin lacks fat nourishment, so you can apply milk and borax glycerin, which is very effective. However, milk is very easy to spoil, so it is better to use Invincible brand Butterfly Cream, because Butterfly Cream is made of milk cool, does not contain alkalinity, and can absorb the nourishing ingredients in the air to moisturize the skin, so it can avoid chapped skin and stop itching, which is very effective. As for internal blood tonics, Invincible brand grape juice or wine is the most suitable.</p>
<p>The skin of women and children is extremely delicate and is easily damaged by wind and sun, so they often apply powder for protection, just like houses are painted and walls are plastered. It is certain that those who are painted and plastered will last longer and stay new than those who are not painted and plastered. It is also to protect the weak nature of the content, increase the appearance, and facilitate washing away dust and resisting wind and sun. The method is very good. However, the face powder in ancient times was made by burning lead and tin. There are three types of lead: one is white lead, translated as zinc, the second is blue lead, translated as bismuth, and the third is black lead, directly translated as lead. Among the three, black lead is the cheapest and easily oxidized. When made into lead powder, it turns black when exposed to magnets, so it is harmful to the skin. Western face powder is all made of zinc white, while Eastern face powder is made of blue lead. If you test it with sulfuric acid, you can easily distinguish it. Those that do not change color are not harmful to the skin. Invincible brand blue box powder is zinc white, and yellow box powder is added with bismuth. It is delicate and ironed, which is better than lead powder. This is due to the proper combination, so its advantages are comparable to the face powder of the East and West, and it is truly a good product among skin protectors. Its usage is to apply Butterfly Cream first and then apply powder, so it will not fall off or stick, which is completely different from ordinary greases and vulgar powders.</p>
<p>Once the pocket mirror box powder imported from the West is used up, it is often impossible to add more. You can mail it to the Family Industry Agency on Guohuo Road in Shanghai to ask for a match, but attach a three-cent stamp. If the size is two inches in diameter, the agency has ready-made ones for sale, named "Invincible Brand Matching Powder", which sells for only two cents. All department stores sell it. There is also a small aluminum box with a silk puff, which can also be used directly. However, when transferring it to the mirror box, take out the powder pan. The empty box can also be used for other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Deeds of Mr. Zhao Tieqiao (I) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Guangzu</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau is handling the funeral for my late father. Guangzu and others will accompany my mother and uncle to escort the coffin back to Sichuan to be buried next to the ancestral graves. Because senior members of various revolutionary movements inquired about my late father's deeds, I recount them with tears. It is said that when my late father was over ten years old, he and my late aunt's husband, Huang Lusheng, and Yang Shenyou, were known as the "Three Heroes of Yongning." They were indignant at the corruption of the Qing government and plotted to overthrow it. Yongning was located deep in the mountains, and Sichuan was rife with bandits. The gatherings in Yongning were especially large. The three of them traveled in the mountains, befriending their leaders. Five years before the founding of the Republic of China, Mr. Xiong Fan and Mr. Huang Fusheng were ordered by Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), to plan for Sichuan. Shenyou, my aunt's husband, returned from Japan after studying police work. My late father also returned from Chengdu after transferring from Xulu Middle School to Ziliujing Shuren School. He and Lusheng, my aunt's husband, had both joined the Tongmenghui. Xiong and Huang had already met Shenyou, my aunt's husband, and then together they visited Lusheng, my aunt's husband, and all came to Jin'e Pond to meet my late father. They spoke in secret for days, intending to start an uprising in Yongning. The Yong and Mi factions could not agree, so they established a Youth Association to resolve the issue, explaining the revolution to them. The mountain armies were all happy to hear it. At that time, Mr. Yang Cangbai was the principal of Yongning Middle School, providing chemical products to Mr. Fusheng to make bombs. The medicine exploded, injuring Mr. Fusheng's hand and eye. The matter was somewhat leaked. The county magistrate sent a message saying, "Leave quickly, or you will be arrested." On the ninth day of the ninth month, my late father and more than ten comrades climbed a high mountain, entered a deep forest, slaughtered a cow, brewed wine, drew their swords, struck the ground, and sang and shouted all day before leaving.</p>
<p>They arrived in Luzhou. Because there were many party members in southeastern Sichuan, they wanted to occupy Jiang'an and connect with Yongning, leading the mountain armies out. They planned to attack Luzhou and then go east to Chongqing. It was decided to attack Jiang'an on September 30th. My late father traveled to a neighboring county to meet with party members in Shangjiang, forming the Tieshan (Iron Mountain) organization. My late father and Mr. Cheng Defan were appointed as commanders of Jiang'an. On September 27th, my late father, carrying ten bombs from Tieshan, passed through Yibin, obtained military tickets and a party flag, and rushed into Jiang'an city. Upon arrival, he ordered that a fire be set inside the east gate at midnight. Several hundred patrolmen from Zhenwu Mountain attacked the east gate, and over a thousand bandits attacked the west gate. At midnight, the fire illuminated the sky, and gunfire erupted outside the city. The city was in chaos. My late father and Mr. Cheng stayed in an inn, drafting proclamations and sorting out bombs, believing that the city would fall. They intended to arm themselves and rush out. Officials and soldiers wandered to the inn. Realizing that the situation was about to fail, they firmly held the bombs and sat on the bed, watching for officials and soldiers to enter, intending to throw the bombs and die with them. Officials and soldiers knocked on the door, and they calmly replied, "I am a student. Is the fire extinguished? Why is there gunfire?" The soldiers said, "The fire is about to be extinguished. Don't worry, it's just bandits attacking the city." They did not suspect that the city was being attacked by party members under the command of the two men. They searched the adjacent houses and left. At dawn, our army was defeated. They rushed out of the city and went to Luzhou. After having a meal, they fled to Longchang and hid in a coal pit in Tianle Mountain for more than ten days before returning to Yongning.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Diary of a Pilgrimage to Italy</p>
<p>(2) En Route</p>
<p>The two of us chatted about many trivial things. The other three were all sound asleep. Looking out the window at the sky, I saw only the starry sky, still shimmering tirelessly above. The bumping and jarring of the train played a monotonous tune in the extremely quiet realm. Time passed easily. Before I knew it, it was already dawn. At S station, we got off the train to eat some coffee and bread. From then on, the scenery was very good all the way. By noon, we reached Lake Annecy and Lake Bourget. This is where the French poet Lamartine wrote the poem "The Lake" and fell in love a hundred years ago. Along the way, the verdant and beautiful hills gradually turned into towering mountains. The rushing torrents roared incessantly. How many miles we traveled then, I can't remember. The shape of the clouds, the light of the sun, the temperature of the climate, and everything else gradually changed. From Meana onwards, our train was winding through majestic valleys. This is the highest peak of the Alps. Hundreds of miles of snow-covered peaks, with a momentum of tens of millions, rise straight into the clouds. This is the world-famous Mont Blanc. Mont Blanc is such a beautiful name, such a grand place name. It is so white and so high. White. It is truly untouched by a single speck of dust. High. It is high in a meaningful way. There are peaks beyond the clouds, and peaks on top of peaks. My heart truly envies its whiteness and height. (Mont Blanc is 4,810 meters high, equivalent to 10,000 feet.) Although there are also graceful clouds covering and winding around it, and raging winds invading it, the air it enjoys is ultimately different. It is still so white and so high. This sublime and wonderful realm is completely natural. There is simply nothing you can do about it. You can only look up at it. But I was the only one gazing up at it from the window, not wanting to miss a single moment. If I had the chance to live in this desolate valley and fully enjoy it, I might be able to produce abundant and beautiful works. I truly think so. I have traveled to Mount Tai, Mount Hua, and Mount Heng, but they are ultimately not as majestic as these hundreds of miles of white peaks piercing the clouds, or as open and bright. Back then, Napoleon led his troops, stepped over Mont Blanc, and entered Italy with such spirit. His great footprints can still make people imagine and be amazed.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Slight Rise in Financial Specie Market <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Small Fluctuations, Transactions Evened Out</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the specie market on the fourth was peaceful, with a slight potential for a rise. However, there were no major changes. The total difference was only two or three taels. As for foreign exchange, it was strong in the morning and weak in the afternoon. Banks were selling, and the intentions of other firms seemed high, but transactions were not idle. However, there were no large amounts. This was probably because the banks would close on the sixth of this month, and the gold market would also be closed for one day. Therefore, most people were just evening out their positions. For example, Yongfeng, Yuancheng Yong, and hedgers were all taking deliveries, while Da, Taikangrun, and Richang, among others, were generally selling. The market saw a high surge early in the day because it was rumored that the United States had a lot of silver bars to supply. Although the price went up, the market situation was very soft, and people's hearts were uneasy. Afterwards, the market fluctuated slightly by one or two taels. Then, because sellers were eager to sell and the market atmosphere was not good, rumors suddenly arose that government bonds were falling. As a result, the market turned sharply downwards and plummeted to just over sixty-three taels. Until the final outcome, Yuan Maoyong and others chased after the market, suddenly pulling it up by more than one tael, to above sixty-four taels. In the afternoon, because it was the weekend, the market was closed according to regulations.</p>
<p>Silver Prices Rose Immediately at the Opening</p>
<p>The opening price of the November specie market was 565.4 taels, an increase of 2.1 taels. However, British silver bars rose another three-sixteenths, and American silver also rose one-quarter. Japanese and American silver rose one-sixteenth. Unmoved by this, the gross market fluctuated by about two taels, from 64.5 taels to 66.9 taels, then back down to within 5 taels. Each firm's movements were different. As for drafts, they remained stable. The December British gold was sold by the China Merchants Bank at 7 1/2 pence. At just after 9:20, buyers in the trading floor saw the movement and first ordered the price to be listed, then suddenly changed it, and it rose to 66.67 taels. Afterwards, there were divergent opinions among the clerks, so there was an upward and downward movement of more than one tael, fluctuating around 66 taels. There was not much change in drafts. The December American gold was traded between Japanese banks at 39.5 taels. Mitsui had offered to sell the next month's Japanese gold at 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen to 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 7.5 hao. Until after 11 o'clock, a sudden decline appeared. Yuan Maoyong, Yu Da, Taikangrun, and others entered the market one after another to sell. In the end, rumors about the current situation caused people's hearts to turn downwards, and the price fell by three taels. In an instant, a storm arose, and at 11:20, it fell to 63.2 taels. The China Bank and Zhengjin Bank traded this month's British gold at 7 1/2 pence. Afterwards, because the sellers stopped, the price rose by one tael. However, at 11:45, retail sellers began to sell, causing the price to retreat to 63.56 taels. Before long, hedgers entered the market to buy, and at the noon close, the price was 64.4 taels, then it rose again to around 65 taels. Compared to the day before, it rose by 1.1 taels. The maximum price for half a day was 66.9 taels, and the minimum price was 63.2 taels, a difference of 3.7 taels. The morning price of goods was 5.3 taels, and the noon closing price was 4.8 taels. The listed price was still calculated at 621 taels, deducting 55 to more than 56 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions of Various Firms Were Complex and Unpredictable</p>
<p>It is estimated that Yongfeng, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Cuitai, Jin'an, Fuchang, and Yuantai all bought in. Richang, Yu Tai, Taikangrun, Fuxing Yong, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Shunli, Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, Jin Dayong, etc., all sold out. Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, Yongcheng Chang, and Zhifeng Yong, etc., sold and then bought back, appearing particularly keen. Xieyu, Yongde, Yongheng, and Tongtaichang, etc., bought in first and then sold out, and speculators generally sold out. The Dalian gang sold a total of more than 1,800 items, and then bought in more than 500 items. The Guangdong gang only sold a few hundred items.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Foreign Exchange Inner Market Initially Firm, Then Loose <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Sudden Rise in Japanese-American Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market continued to rise, but the market situation was stable and transactions were not strong. Because sellers in the United States were eager to sell, there were fears that silver prices would fall. The exchange rates between Britain and America, and Japan and America, had been mediocre for many days. Today, a sudden rise was seen. Afterwards, the horizontal performance of the Kobe market showed no improvement or deterioration. The exchange rates listed by HSBC showed no changes in any of the exchange rates. The inner market was initially firm and then loose. The result was similar to the previous night's closing. Only the Japanese exchange rate rose slightly by 0.125. The specie market seemed to rise slightly, but the market situation was still stable, with a turnaround of only about three taels. This was due to the closing of customs and the closing of the market, so both long and short positions had to be evened out, so transactions were not strong. The trend in the exchange market was therefore generally stable. Although there were not many transactions by Chinese merchants, it was not deserted. It is estimated that 100,000 pounds of British gold were transacted. The Dalian gang and various gold firms all settled in. Banks such as Sumitomo, Mercantile, Eastern Asia, Zhongfu, and Andar all sold some. Also, the banks traded tens of thousands of pounds between themselves. Zhengjin Bank had a slightly larger appetite. Also, more than 100,000 yuan of American gold was settled. Japanese banks made several tens of thousands of yuan with each other. The gold industry also bought several tens of thousands of yuan of Japanese exchange. Mitsui and Korea both sold some. Next Monday, all banks will be closed for the Mid-Autumn Festival as usual for one day, and business will resume as usual on Tuesday (the 7th).</p>
<p>British Exchange: The inner market only fluctuated by 0.0625. The price offered in October was 1 shilling 7 375/1000 pence, and the buying price was 4375/1000. The price offered in November was 4375/1000, the price offered in December was 0.5 pence, and the price offered in January was 5625/1000. The closing price was 4375/1000 in October, 0.5 pence in November, 5625/1000 in December, and 625/1000 in January. The buying price was the offered price plus 0.0625.</p>
<p>American Exchange: The inner market sought a fluctuation of 0.125. The price offered for this month in the early market was 39.25 yuan, 39.375 yuan for November, 39.5 yuan for December, and 39.625 yuan for January. The buying price was the offered price plus 0.125. The closing price was 39.375 yuan for this month, 39.5 yuan for November, 39.5 yuan for November, 39.625 yuan for December, and 39.75 yuan for January. The buying price was 39.875 yuan.</p>
<p>East Exchange: The inner market had a difference of half a fen. Transactions were normal. The price offered in the early market for October was 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen 5 hao, 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen for November, 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 5 hao for December, and 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 2.5 hao for January. The buying price was reduced by half a fen. The closing price for this month was 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen, 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 5 hao for November, 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen for December, and 1 tael 2 qian 4 fen 7.5 hao for January.

<p>China and India Buy In... Citibank Tends to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphs, silver bars continued to rise. Both China and India bought in. Transactions were scarce, the market situation was calm, and the after-market was uncertain. Citibank tended to sell. Both near-term and long-term silver rose by 0.1875, both to 16 pence 0.625 (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 pence 0.6875 in British gold). According to New York telegraphs, American silver prices also continued to rise by 0.25, reaching the 3.6-point mark. British silver rose by 0.0625 against American silver, to 4 dollars 8 jiao 5 fen 96875/100000. American silver rose by 0.09375 against British silver, calculated at 4 dollars 8 jiao 6 fen.

The Telecom telegraph arrived at 9:05 a.m., also with no rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Gradual Decline in Foreign Cents, Great Loosening of Monetary Conditions <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview</p>
<p>Yesterday, because it was Saturday, the financial community closed banks in the afternoon as usual. Withdrawals and deposits were very quiet, and the market situation was also very sluggish, leading to a gradual decline in cent prices and a slump in monetary conditions. Various supply and demand phenomena were also far less prosperous than before. It can be seen that the current commercial prospects have been greatly impacted due to various reasons, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Cent Discount Prices</p>
<p>(Foreign Cents) The cent price in the early market was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 7 hao 5 si, a decrease of 7 hao 5 si from the previous day's market price. The price continued to fall in the afternoon market, decreasing by 0.1 hao 2 hu ban to 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 6 hao 2 hu ban, a very weak situation. (Silver Discount) 4 fen in the early market, 3 fen in the afternoon market, a slight decrease from the previous day. The loosening of monetary conditions was rare. There were no bank listings for overdrafts.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions</p>
<p>Jiangnan Small Silver Dollars: The price remained at 6 qian 5 fen 4 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the morning market price from the previous day, with no slight changes. Transactions were 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong Small Silver Dollars: The price in the early market was 6 qian 3 fen 6 li 8 hao 7 si ban, and the price in the afternoon market was 6 qian 3 fen 7 li ban, slightly better by half a li compared to the previous afternoon market. Transactions were 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 100,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were reduced by 1,000 wen, to 386 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Yesterday, because banks were closed in the afternoon as usual, withdrawals and deposits were very simple. Chinese merchants made withdrawals and deposits of over 1.7 million yuan, foreign merchants made withdrawals and deposits of over 1.1 million yuan, and various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and other items amounted to 6.67 million yuan in withdrawals and deposits, with 800,000 yuan being taken out of warehouses. Japanese banks made withdrawals and deposits of over 3.1 million yuan, with 200,000 yuan being taken out of warehouses. Qianzhuang (money shops) and silver public agencies made withdrawals and deposits of over 28 million yuan, Liu Tou funds made withdrawals and deposits of over 2.5 million yuan, and various remittance funds made withdrawals and deposits of over 900,000 yuan, with about 1 million yuan being received in cash. (Foreign Funds): In the early market, foreign exchange drafts amounted to 1,545,000 yuan, and in the afternoon market, 775,000 yuan. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market, but outside the trading floor, banknotes amounted to 138,000 yuan in the early market and 75,000 yuan in the afternoon market. Bank transactions amounted to 350,000 yuan in the early market and 450,000 yuan in the afternoon market. The inflow and outflow of foreign accounts between banks was over 1.4 million yuan. Over 1.1 million yuan was withdrawn for foreign accounts, and over 1.7 million yuan was borrowed for foreign accounts. Transactions for small businesses amounted to 700,000 yuan. The source of customers was 240,000 yuan from Hangzhou, over 800,000 yuan from various ports, and over 300,000 yuan being diverted.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Securities: The Bond Market Was Even More Depressed <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market situation in the local securities market was such that there were no transactions in the spot market in either the morning or afternoon. The futures market was also inactive. The market sentiment was exceptionally calm. Major buyers and sellers remained on the sidelines, and the forces of supply and demand were very balanced. Bond prices were also stable, with almost no changes in either the morning or afternoon. The stagnant situation was unseen in months. The result was generally slightly firmer than the previous day, but only by a small margin. The total futures transactions for the day were over 6.3 million yuan. The military reorganization bonds were still good, but others were still inactive. The stock exchange will be closed for one day next Monday for the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Yarn &amp; Cotton: A Calm Yarn Market <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Yarn Exchange Will Be Closed Tomorrow for the Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the overall situation remains depressed. The decline in third-grade yarn is severe, and the sales of spot yarn are becoming increasingly bleak, resulting in an extremely soft market. However, some manufacturers are still holding tight, so it has not fallen further. In short, a fundamental solution requires sluggishness, and it is difficult to reduce the amount of underlying goods, making it even more difficult for the market to turn around. However, long-term buyers expect that real sales may improve significantly after the festival. If this is not the case, the market price may see a further decline.</p>
<p>Extremely Scarce Human Bidding Transactions</p>
<p>The market opened with a decline in American cotton third-grade, and there were fewer buyers in the trading floor, but the market sentiment was still firm, with each price rising by one qian. After two or three rounds of trading, the market turned down, and the middle month ultimately fell by one or two qian. In the afternoon, third-grade yarn fell again, but the market situation was still firm. Due to the two-day market closure, there were even fewer transactions in the trading floor, and each month rose slightly by one, three, or four qian. The total transaction volume for the day was only 8,700 bales. Chasing sold 750 bales, Rongxing 700 bales, Yuantai 700 bales, Yiyu 800 bales, and the rest were 200 to 300 bales. Heshang bought 1,150 bales, Yicheng 900 bales, and the rest were 200 to 300 bales. The closing prices of human bids are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>March: 1532, 2, 3,850</p>
<p>Spot Demand Was Smooth, Then Mediocre</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn were relatively smooth. It is estimated that the total purchases from various gangs for the day were 900 bales, with 100 bales coming from the same industry. The market conditions were mediocre. Among the customer gangs, 205 bales came from Sichuan, 190 bales from the inland, 365 bales from Xiamen, 85 bales from Hankou, and 140 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Cotton Market Creates a Stalemate <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is dim and lifeless, but the trend of American cotton is soft again. The decline in consumption makes it difficult to rise. However, the local cotton market is firm, and the long and short sides are engaged in fierce competition, creating a stalemate. In short, the global situation is not good, and Chinese cotton cannot stand alone. Third-grade Dongyang cotton is gradually finding new low prices, and the distant month has fallen into the 32 yuan range. The standard cotton is completely absorbed by inland merchants and held tightly, and spot sales in the market are stagnant. The mills have no appetite. If the source is squeezed in the future, the mills will still not inquire. At that time, the bulls will be willing to sell, and there may be a major decline.</p>
<p>A Clearly Defined Hankou Standard</p>
<p>The Hankou standard market opened with a soft wind in American cotton, and people's spirits were low, but there were not many people staying in the trading floor. Each month fell by five fen. In the afternoon, transactions in the trading floor were particularly scarce, and there were many empty boards. Each month rose slightly by five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 15,300 dan. Mao Ji sold 1,800 dan, Tianlong 1,100 dan, Hanfeng 700 dan, and the others 500 to 900 dan. Yu Da bought 1,100 dan, Shenyu 1,100 dan, and the others 700 to 900 dan. The closing prices of the Hankou standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Shaanxi Cotton: 33.00, Yong'an Factory entered 300 pieces of spot goods to the factory. Anqing Cotton: 32.50, Tongyi Factory entered 200 bales of spot goods to the factory. Yao Cotton: 30.8 to 31.8, Customer gang entered 500 bales of spot goods to the warehouse.</p>

<p>Continued Weakness in Southern Sales of American Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to pressure from sellers, then firm due to power on Wall Street, and finally weakened again due to Southern sales. Futures fell by 6 to 15 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 5 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Pingguoer fell by one rupee, Aomu La was unchanged, and Bairo Creek rose by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left.

<h3 id="e176">Grains: The Decline in the Rice Market Is Gradually Stabilizing <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Scented Indica Rice Shows Slight Recovery</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, about 20 boats arrived on Lilu Road. The market was quite active, and the new japonica rice turned flat due to the diligence of the shops. High-grade large plates showed no rise or fall, and top-grade japonica rice still opened at 16 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen, while old and broken japonica rice only saw scattered arrivals, and the market was stable. Sheep Du Tip was in short supply, and the turnover was extremely smooth, with customers inquiring, so the price recovered by 2 jiao. High-quality goods opened at 13 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen, specialty tip rice required 11.5 yuan, port tip rice required 12 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen. The above all rose by 2 or 3 jiao, and the goods sold well because of the lower price. After the sharp decline, the origin transporters gradually watched and decreased the source. The new japonica indica rice markets are now shifting due to the prosperity and scarcity of arrivals, and the change from fixed to tight is 1 or 2 jiao. Top-grade yuan opened at the 18 yuan mark, and new Yin Yuan continued to arrive, but they were all scattered small batches of goods shipped by boat, and the market was in a stable state.</p>
<p>Shanghai South: It is estimated that over 20 boats arrived yesterday, and the sales in the street were still good. The high-quality new japonica rice on the west road was still equal to the Zhabei market, but the Sutong goods were initially slightly softer and then stabilized. The high opening was 14.5 yuan, and the early red indica rice on the south road saw both arrivals and slow sales. The price was similar to the previous market, still at 15 yuan. The situation of the Sheep Du Tip was slightly firmer, with the high-quality price doing 12 yuan 1 or 2 jiao, close to a good price. The turnover of the Jiaobai Tip on the street was smooth, seeing a rise in the corners, opening at 12.5 yuan. The new Yin Yuan and Yuan saw a slight increase in the large plate due to the active sales.</p>

<p>Affected by New Arrivals of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market was affected by new arrivals of Saigon rice, and people's minds were soft. Jiangxi rice also had scattered arrivals, and Anhui Nanjing rice also arrived by train</p>
<h3 id="e178">Flour Prices Near and Far are Firm <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in both the morning and afternoon, prices for all months showed a trend of being firm in both the near and far terms. This month, due to sluggish actual sales and the large number of warehouse receipts from previous months that have not yet been fully sold, the bulls cannot avoid being cautious. It seems that the warehouse receipts to come in the future still appear considerable, given the high market prices. However, for the far-term months, market sentiment has stabilized. As the price of foreign wheat continues to rise by two or three dimes to seven or eight dimes, sales are rare, and the market naturally shows vitality. Moreover, the inverted price structure will be difficult to sustain when supply and demand even out in the future. The shift in market sentiment is not without reason. As a result, this month's price is up by a small 0.025 tael compared to the previous day, November and December are up by 0.1 tael, January/February is up by 0.075 tael, and March is up by 0.125 tael.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Reasons for the Stabilization of Wheat Futures <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The continued rise in foreign wheat prices led to hedging in the wheat futures market yesterday. After the opening bell in both the morning and afternoon, prices for all months generally stabilized. As the quotations for foreign wheat continued to rise, many large short sellers engaged in hedging for November and December. For the far-term months, speculative shorts gradually covered their positions based on foreign wheat quotations, and inland dealers also followed suit, causing the market to improve across the board. The market situation has reached a point where it needs to temporarily consolidate and observe the trend. As a result, this month's price is up by 0.1 tael compared to the previous day, November is up by 0.3 tael, December is up by 0.1 tael, January/February is up by 0.2 tael, and March is unchanged. The spot wheat market is such that manufacturers and dealers are willing to trade only after a method is agreed upon for inspecting inventory and bearing costs.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Market for Various Grains is Mixed <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Peanut Kernels: Yesterday, the supply from the north was quite high. However, due to the new harvest, transactions were mostly small-scale. The sales market was most active in the southern region and the local street, with prices remaining stable. 30 bags of new Yantai peanuts were offered at 8 taels, and 70 bags of raw kernels, 150 bags of Qingdao raw kernels, and 80 bags of Tengxian raw kernels were offered at prices ranging from 9 to 10 taels.</p>
<p>Sesame: Sesame market prices are sluggish, and the foreign merchant market is even more sluggish. Prices are declining steadily, while the supply from inland areas continues to arrive. As a result, both new and old goods are listless. Yesterday, trading was light, with a total of over 1,000 bags traded, including Jiujiang sesame (with pass) at 8.3 taels, milk sesame and Nanjing white sesame at 7.5 taels, Jiangbei white sesame at 7.15 taels, and Mingguang old white sesame at 7.15 taels.</p>
<p>Yellow Beans: Standard bean prices rose by 0.2 to 0.3 tael due to the increase in telegram fees. However, demand from all parties was weak, with only a few customers making small purchases. The market trend was勉呈 to be firm and stable. Most of the current soybean sales were small-scale transactions in local street factories and mills, and the trend was flat. 1,500 bags of Jiujiang soybeans were offered at a high of 5.11 taels, 500 bags of Lizhou Che yellow beans and 170 bags of Huaiyuan beans were offered at a high of 4.68 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Expect Futures Prices to Rise <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The entire silk factory in Shanghai went on strike... Domestic merchants took the opportunity to hoard silk in the local foreign merchant market. Spot sales remained sluggish due to the lack of overseas demand and stagnant silk telegrams. European and American hoarders, seeing that the entire silk factory in Shanghai had gone on strike and was unlikely to resume operations soon, took the opportunity to hoard silk futures. Yesterday morning, negotiations were held with various European merchants, and the manufacturers, seeing that silk prices were not easing, hoped to sell at high prices. Silk prices are expected to rise, but transactions are pending.</p>
<h3 id="e182">New York Italian Silk Prices Drop by Another 0.3-0.4 USD <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The New York market has seen a further decline in Italian silk prices recently. Silk mills find Italian silk prices too high and are not inquiring. Current silk factory sales are sluggish, and market prices have fallen sharply by 0.3 to 0.4 USD. Extra-extra grade is offered at $4.50 per pound, extra grade at $4.20, and superior grade at $3.80.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Russian Merchants to Organize Tea Purchases Soon <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Since the Russian merchants' association stopped organizing tea purchases, the local foreign merchant tea market has been in sharp decline. Now, seeing that the Hankou incident has eased and shipping schedules are urgent, the Russian merchants have decided to start organizing tea purchases on the 6th of this month. However, this year's road-hauled silk and tea production is estimated to be about 100,000 boxes lower than last year, and the quantity of tribute tea is only about 40,000 boxes, which may not be enough to meet the Russian merchants' demand. Therefore, Chinese merchants are unwilling to sell at reduced prices.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Dried Goods: Supply of Sun-Dried Longan Meat Greatly Reduced <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Prices Expected to Rise: Sun-dried longan meat prices had previously fallen by about 2 taels due to sluggish sales and the pressure from cheap Hainan goods. However, land transportation costs are still high, so when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's large ships arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the supply was greatly reduced, with only 19 pieces in total. The inventory in local shops is also low, suggesting that prices may rise slightly, but not excessively.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Textiles: Actual Sales of Textiles Quiet Down <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Textile trading was suddenly quiet yesterday. As the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, local customers were closing their books. Additionally, banks and customs will be closed for the next two days, making it impossible to ship goods. As a result, transactions in the market were extremely light, and the market was slightly sluggish. There was an increasing supply of East Asian printed cloth, and local street shops had previously sold a large amount, leading to an oversupply. Yesterday, most East Asian printed cloths were cleared through customs at 0.23 taels. Yuehua fell by 0.025 tael, black floral sold for 0.2 tael, medium floral for 0.2025 tael, and large floral for 0.2075 tael after commission. A large quantity of straight tribute satin arrived, with Yuekong quoted at 0.297 tael, Shizhu at 0.28 tael, Magu at 0.285 tael, and Feima Tong currently requiring 0.2875 tael. Straight tribute flannel was shipped in large quantities to Wanbei Zhenjiang and other ports, reportedly due to additional taxes. Yesterday, Moganshan was priced at 0.32 tael, Lieyan at 0.325 tael, and Shuangtonglu at 0.2925 tael, with over 100 pieces shipped out. Western goods were even quieter, and bleached cloth was rarely inquired about as the season ended. The asking prices for Yuanchou Taixi satin were too high, making it difficult to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Metals: Black Sheet Iron Prices Increase by 0.25 tael <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Ten sheets of black sheet iron increased in price by 0.25 tael yesterday and were sold for 10.075 taels. It is said that the recent supply has been extremely tight, while demand from various regions has been strong, resulting in a lack of inventory in the market. It is also said that Yingkou, Niuzhuang, and other regions have recently been making more purchases, so prices may rise further in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Sugar Market: Sales of New Coarse White Sugar Still Active <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports from producing regions showed that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.03125, down 0.0625 from the previous report. New York sugar futures were priced at 1.07 for December, 1.18 for March next year, 1.25 for May, and 1.38 for September, up by 0.01 tael, except for May, which was unchanged. The buying interest in coarse white sugar from the guild remained quiet, with new goods selling briskly at 8 taels, while old goods saw little interest at 7.8 taels. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 7.75 taels, No. 18 at 7.7 taels, and No. 10 Dutch red sugar at 6.55 taels. Due to the surge in arrivals, the market was generally flat and sluggish. Transactions in Japanese sugar were also limited, with N mark at 8 taels, 　mark at 8.125 taels, YT mark at 7.85 taels, and YP mark at 8 taels. Demand was weak, and the market was depressed. The exchange offered its own ice flower green sugar, with the price remaining at the original 7.6 taels, and the market remained firm.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Expansion Monthly Second Issue <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>By Yang Shaozhi</p>
<p>Edited by the Expansion Literary Society</p>
<p>Since June 1st of this year, when Nationalist literary movement participants gathered in Shanghai and issued a declaration, a roar of protest has risen in literary circles. In the current era, where both old and new literature have declined, it seems a life-saving force has emerged, rescuing the dying literary world's crisis and paving the way for its progress. Their representative publication, the Vanguard Weekly, was thus born. It has now been published up to its seventeenth issue. Many have already introduced its rich content and solid theoretical base, so there is naturally no need for me to bother. Although it is a publication with limited capacity, it has already generated sufficient power. Following this, the most diligent Nationalist literary movement was naturally in Nanjing. This is not surprising, considering Nanjing is where Jiangnan scholars gather, and it is also the capital of the Republic of China. Therefore, the literary circles of Nanjing, with convenient transportation and a fondness for literature, easily accepted the emerging literary movement, realizing that only the literature needed in the current state of China could save the declining state of Chinese literature. Consequently, many Nationalist literary groups in Nanjing sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain, and Nationalist literary publications bloomed like bursting buds.</p>
<p>"Expansion" is such a publication of the times. It has recently been published to its second issue. In the second issue, there are five original works, four of which are novels and one a play. In addition, there is a translated novel, an article on popular drama, and an article discussing "The National Consciousness Expressed in Shandong Folk Songs."</p>
<p>Bearing the banner of a Nationalist literary publication, logically, every creation should naturally reveal its national character. Nationalist literary movement participants once told us in the inaugural issue of Vanguard Weekly that the characteristics of Nationalist literature are "powerful, hopeful, bright, willful, and spiritual. It should awaken national consciousness, inspire national vitality, and unite to fight for the nation." However, in "Expansion," we rarely find these characteristics, which inevitably leaves us with some disappointment amidst our welcome. This is, of course, too harsh a criticism, but it can also be said that our love is too intense. I hope the editors of "Expansion" can forgive my nitpicking, and at the same time, I also hope the editors of "Expansion" will pay more attention to this aspect, clearly reveal our central consciousness, and intensify the responsibility of awakening national consciousness.</p>
<p>"The National Consciousness Expressed in Shandong Folk Songs" is an article by Lou Zikuang reading Gu Qizhong's compilation "Collection of Shandong Folk Songs." From it, he gathered several items expressing unique national consciousness and formed this article. Folk songs are originally national, and adding some national consciousness to them naturally makes them Nationalist literature. The suffering of the Shandong people has long been subject to the ravages of warlords, and they often encounter the frequent poisoning of red and white imperialists. Under the ravages, they naturally have to struggle for their own survival, and under the oppression, they naturally have to issue painful groans for their own survival. Therefore, in their folk songs, they also try their best to reveal the call to overthrow imperialists and eliminate the remaining warlords. There are indeed several of them that I think are remarkable. Let me introduce all the ones about overthrowing imperialists and eliminating warlords:</p>
<p>(1) Folk songs about hating imperialists</p>
<p>Advise compatriots,</p>
<p>Remember firmly,</p>
<p>The May 3rd massacre is no small matter,</p>
<p>Sever economic ties with Japan,</p>
<p>Never forget it – Shandong Zhangqiu</p>
<p>(2) Folk songs about eliminating the remaining warlords</p>
<p>One two three four five,</p>
<p>Attack Jinan Prefecture,</p>
<p>First kill Zhang Zongchang,</p>
<p>Then kill Chu Yupu,</p>
<p>First there were the Boxers,</p>
<p>Then there were the Red Lanterns,</p>
<p>Touched the telegraph pole,</p>
<p>Killed Zhang Zongchang,</p>
<p>Only then woke up to peace! | Shandong Ningyang</p>
<p>In short, I think these kinds of folk songs are worth introducing. I further hope that departments in various places can record and publicize this type of folk song as much as possible.</p>
<p>The insults that overseas Chinese suffer in foreign countries are naturally the result of our Chinese nation being old and incompetent. The situation of these insults is almost equivalent to the pain encountered in the Miao dens occupied by irrational barbarians. If it were completely and thoroughly recorded, I am afraid it would really be infuriating. The article "Returning to the Country" depicts a scene of the insults suffered by overseas Chinese. Can we accept the elegant name of "dirty yellow"? Friends, the time has come, ignite our national emotions, join a just and bright organization, and work together for the nation!</p>
<p>In the old society, the concept of moral teaching不知道葬送了多少有爲的靑年男女, the play "The Death of the Fengxin" is about a promising young man who was活活地被社會排擠得不容其生存. He died under the 名敎. It is a fact. A widow and orphan who cannot maintain their lives, while she got a man, maintaining their lives, has been in the spirit of three-day-long. She takes care of her own life and happiness, and she also takes care of the future of the orphans. She remarried. Is this action worth cursing? She woke up, she boldly冒天下的不大韙 and did this thing that people can't do. But the fact is even more unexpected. I want to curse the ruthlessness of the old society. The old society is toounforgiving to people. Because of her mother's remarriage, even this orphan was associated with being despised by society forever, and was constantly排擠 by society with惡辣手叚, causing him to sacrifice in the old society. The桔桎 of etiquette is too binding. Are we willing to be conquered綿羊, or are we willing to be sinners in 名敎? Awakened young people, come and work hard to break the堅壁 of 名敎 and save promising compatriots!</p>
<p>Also, the article "Random Talks on Popular Drama" is worth reading. The remaining articles inevitably still have the atmosphere of romance and decay. If these articles were published in literary publications, they might be worth appreciating. In Nationalist literary publications, it seems they should not have a place.</p>
<p>In short, in the two issues already published, "Expansion" does not yet have much substantial theory or enthusiastic and powerful creations. However, at least they have recognized the bright path. Future success can naturally also be predicted. May the gardeners bravely and carefully work hard together to cultivate this newly expanded garden and irrigate these buds that have not yet bloomed, in order to obtain a rich and fulfilling harvest!</p>
<h3 id="e207">Embellishments <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Hua</p>
<p>Dusting Off the Lotus</p>
<p>Originally, in our old and vast China, riddled with sores, the toxins of the old society were deeply rooted in the stubborn hearts of people, especially in those remote and backward places. Due to inconvenient transportation or various other factors, even though it is now the so-called "20th century," they stubbornly maintain the full-blown old-fashioned habits of the old and young conservatives. Around them, it seems as if there is an iron wall that is difficult to break through, and they rarely accept modern culture. Even if there is some input, it will be hindered by the evils of the old society and suffer from indigestion. In name, China is already a country that has undergone revolutionary baptism, and at least those corrupt and old forces should be eradicated. However, if we calmly examine the facts, we will be greatly disappointed, just like the few witty satirical words described by the author of this book:</p>
<p>"...The Temple of Guan Yu... The walls are covered with broken and scattered colorful paper slogans, leaving traces of the so-called mass rally (!) three months ago, remnants of the declining theocratic era, as if wearing a multicolored fashionable dress."</p>
<p>In fact, in these places, revolution is just a show of changing the soup but not the medicine. Some old low-ranking officials of the seventh rank and old conservatives who retreated from the Qing Dynasty, or newly emerged fierce dog heads, just need to put on a revolutionary (!) coat over their rotten and stinky bodies, and they will immediately ascend the dragon gate and their value will increase tenfold. Then they can take advantage of their power and oppress the people, truly deserving the name of public bandits. Under their coercion, there are even some scholars and inferior runners, and the old etiquette relies entirely on these people to maintain it, so it can openly exist in the world. Once one or two young people with blood dare to confront them slightly, they can add the label of "traitor," which is even more powerful than violating the law, without any hesitation, and do whatever they want. This is an old trick they often use. Under this electric-grid-like tyranny, I don't know how many young people have been sacrificed.</p>
<p>Originally, some were bandit-scholars, but now that there is a revolution, they only need to wear a triangular belt, and they will transform themselves into revolutionary figures under the banner of the Blue Sky White Sun, and they can openly carry out their old tricks. There are indeed many kinds of tricks.</p>
<p>This kind of society really cannot tolerate good people. The general youth with blood are truly suffocated. Not only is love not free, but even slight anti-old remarks or actions must be careful about their heads. Under this heavy low pressure, the minds of young people are really bitter and depressed. The author of this book is someone who has suffered and been depressed in this environment. His wounded soul is now spread out before us with bloodstains. This is what we should thank him for. He has opened up a mental river for us, those who suffer from mental depression, a river that we want to vomit but cannot, and has boldly announced the crimes of the dog-headed society. How gratifying this is.</p>
<p>Cowardice seems to be the inferiority of our Chinese nation, especially the youth nowadays, who always muddle through things and dare not resist, only willing to submit. Therefore, the two sides of life cannot be unified, and there is constant contradiction in their minds. They clearly know that the environment is unreasonable, and they consciously feel that living in this environment is really unbearable. They often resent and curse the unsatisfactory reality, and at the same time, a new society grows in their ideals, which is completely different from the current one. The more they miss the ideal society, the more they hate reality, feeling that the surroundings are full of cruel, hypocritical, and deceitful creatures. So they think about fighting for their pitiful kind and against reality, feeling that they themselves are supremely sacred. However, no matter how beautiful your thoughts are, you can't stop the cynicism given by reality several times, and you will start to doubt, turn gray, and finally make you timid. In convenience, you will also compromise with reality, and as a result, you will be trapped in depression forever. Your conscience is permanently in heavy condemnation. The reality that you originally resolved to eliminate is still making a show of force around you, and the most sacred ideal society has become an illusion. Everything is attributed to fate, and you will even hate the ideal palace you once worshiped, forever dejected, indulging, and even dying.</p>
<p>The protagonist of this book, Wang Lie Feng, is a representative of this kind of person. He sees with his own eyes that his love rival is a heartless beast. He is the one who killed Wang Chun Sheng and burned the San Chun Xuan. He is the one who put the crimes he committed on the heads of kind farmers. He is the one who hung these kind and innocent farmers on the stove to make braised human flesh. His lover is also the fiancee of this beast, and he is also wrongly accused of being a communist bandit by him. He had previously said solemnly, "In order to liberate the suffering of all living beings, I will not hesitate to sacrifice myself," but he explained self-deceptively out of fear, "It was just an accidental fate, paired with such a thing. I had never resisted in the slightest, and at most I had stolen money and glared at the enemy a few times. I was already afraid that I was too rash." How ridiculous and contradictory this is. Later, when his lover was taken alive to Mei Ling to be buried by his beast-like fiancé, he did not go forward to save his brave lover and die with her. Instead, he retreated into the alley, just fainting in fear, and only shouting, "Go to Mei Ling, what else does the world have for me?"</p>
<p>This is the most pitiful person in the world. He is not at ease with reality, and he dare not resist it in the slightest. It would have been forgivable if he had been a sleepy-eyed person, but to be a rebel of conscience and a slave of the environment is truly an unforgivable sinner.</p>
<p>The author once said in his preface:</p>
<p>"When writing this little thing, my state of mind changed several times. At first, I sympathized with my protagonist Wang Lie Feng, pitying his dream of pursuing light. Gradually, I hated him. So I put a 'corpse's clothes' on him, letting him pass away in the cold wind. That can also be said to be hating myself, punishing my gray self."</p>
<p>It is very clear that the author has already taken on this responsibility. Wang Lie Feng is wearing a "corpse's clothes." Here, the author has already expressed himself, hating Wang Lie Feng and himself.</p>
<p>However, we cannot deny that this "corpse's clothes" is an unlucky thing. Therefore, I still hope that the author and himself will shout at the end of the preface,</p>
<p>"Light around, my efforts!</p>
<p>I am on my way again. I hope that a book is indeed partially successful in art. I believe that the author wrote his work with an honest heart, and there is not a single place where facts are fabricated and unrealistic. However, the layout has some flaws, and the scenes in each section cannot be tightly knit. The first section is a dynamic ending, which makes people stand up their hair, but the second section starts with a loose stillness, which seems a bit lax. It may not be without its shortcomings.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the first section to page eleven, I initially thought that the author was narrating the facts. In the middle of page eleven, it suddenly turned like this, "He couldn't think anymore..." It really confused me for a while. Later, I looked closely, and who knew that the above were all Lie Feng and her lover's memories standing by the bridge. This kind of arrangement is really not very beautiful and is also a small shortcoming of this book.</p>

<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(10) News of Spring</p>
<p>"...Friends, has the solid ice of the northern frontier melted? Are snowflakes still flying in the sky?... Ah, spring has arrived in Jiangnan, the shallow grasses are green, the peach petals are unfolding... Friends, my wandering friends, I now send a small sprig of peach blossoms and a small branch of willow from Jiangnan to the distant northern frontier, so that you may receive news of spring from your homeland in this land of snow and ice..."</p>
<p>Ah, how greatly I thank you for sending me news of spring, my dear friend!</p>
<p>Outside the window, the jagged, withered branches still bear snow, snowflakes are fluttering down again, and the ice on the river is still frozen solid and unbroken... Haha, this is precisely the season of new spring in Jiangnan! I pondered, I thought of the coming of spring in Jiangnan, that serene, winding little river, lying amidst tender reds and fresh greens, the south wind gently caressing the willow branches on the bank, dotting the still surface of the water, the fallen petals of the Yao flowers sometimes falling languidly, whereupon the fish are startled, rising to the surface, thinking they have found food, chasing after it, finally discouraged and retreating back into the deep water, flipping their tails, the still water splashing with light waves, rippling into wandering whirlpools, the sun peeking from behind the green leaves, smiling.</p>
<p>Whenever I hear the delicate and simple cries of the flower-selling girls in the streets and alleys, I know that spring has arrived, and I always go to take a look at that little river.</p>
<p>But now, I am wandering in the northern frontier, and a friend from Jiangnan is painstakingly telling me the news of spring. However, alas, the snowy fields of the northern frontier are still stirring with cold winds, the delicate necks of the girls are still wrapped in fur collars, and where can I go to see that little river?</p>
<p>"The Songhua River will not thaw until June. When the ice on the Songhua River thaws, new green will be seen on the tree branches, the grasslands will gradually turn green, and coats can be taken off our bodies—by then, I'm afraid spring in Jiangnan will have faded."</p>
<p>"Oh," I dazedly gazed at the gray sky, the snow-covered withered branches, and the gentle dance of snowflakes, "by then, by then spring in Jiangnan will have returned, the peach blossoms will have withered, the willows will have aged, and the water in the little river will have changed color. By then, the girls in the city will have changed into light, thin gauze dresses—but here, we are just beginning to see green leaves emerging from the melting snow, breathing the breath of spring."</p>
<p>—This is the miracle of nature.</p>
<p>So, I tucked the flattened peach petals and willow branches into the pages of my book and continued reading the letter from my Jiangnan friend.</p>
<p>"...Ah, friend, this will evoke your memories of spring... Surely you will not forget the cherry blossoms of Xuanwu Lake, the peach blossoms of Longhua, and the willows of West Lake. Even that still little river that we happened upon during one of our walks will likely enter your memory..."</p>
<h3 id="e216">Jiaotong University Promotes Swimming Program <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Jiaotong University has a swimming pool that other universities (the eight universities that joined the Jiangnan Sports Association) do not have. Their swimming results should dominate Jiangnan and be the best. However, in this swimming championship competition, they were greatly defeated by Jinan, with a score of seventeen to forty-six. What is the reason for this? It is a matter of whether or not they have made the effort to promote swimming. Although Jinan does not have the facilities of a swimming pool, they have made great efforts to promote swimming. Before the summer vacation, the team members camped out at Qingyang Port to practice swimming, and after the summer vacation, they practiced all day at the YMCA swimming pool. The adequacy of their preparation is self-evident. Although Jiaotong University has a swimming pool, it is only open for a short period of time, starting every year from April or May and closing at the end of September. Also, there are specific hours during which the pool is open. During the summer vacation, some team members also return home. Therefore, although there is a swimming pool, it is abandoned and not used. Practice only started two weeks before the competition, so how could they have achieved amazing results? The sports authorities, in view of this, have formulated a swimming promotion program in order to avenge this year's loss when competing with other universities next year. The program includes: (1) The swimming pool will continue to be open this winter. Heating pipes will be installed at the bottom of the pool to increase the water temperature, or a stove will be installed to prevent team members from catching a cold during practice. (2) Once the team members are selected, the gymnasium must set aside time for them to practice. During the designated time, non-team members are not allowed to mingle, and team members are not allowed to avoid practice without reason. With diligent practice, progress will be easy. (3) Swimming experts will be hired to provide guidance. Negotiations have been completed. Mr. Chen Yuehe, a overseas Chinese from Nanyang, will be the swimming instructor, and Mr. Shen Guoquan, the director of physical education at the school, is also an expert. With guidance, the results should be excellent. (4) The team members' physical condition will be checked by the school doctor at any time. Any nutritional deficiencies will be notified and attention paid to them. (5) Next year, they will join various ocean swimming competition groups to learn from each other. They also plan to invite various swimming groups to participate in friendly competitions this year. All of the above programs have been submitted by the director of physical education, Shen Guoquan, to the chairman of the sports committee, Zhong Weicheng, who will then submit them to the president for approval and implementation. Various expenses have also been allocated. The school does have a lot of swimming talent. For example, in the short distance swimming competition, the Jiaotong University team member competed with a Mr. Dong of the Jinan team, only losing by one meter to take second place. In long distance swimming, Huang Taiji, Ye Wu, Xu Yaotang, and others are all talented. If they can be given good guidance and long-term practice, Jinan may not be their opponent. I sincerely hope that the team can make good use of their skills and live up to the excellent facilities.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Revival of the Wall Newspaper Craze <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>|Correspondence|</p>
<p>Jia,</p>
<p>I have received the letter you sent me the day before yesterday. I wanted to reply to you right away, but I am really busy with my studies this year. I lock myself in the library every day, and recently I have been preparing for the monthly exams, so I haven't even had time to write you a letter. I suppose you must be as anxious as the last time, like an ant on a hot pot, pacing back and forth in the gatehouse all day long, right?</p>
<p>Some of the male students in our school pooled their money to create a wall newspaper, posting everything about our female students' actions, forcing me to be as wary as if I were guarding against thieves, being careful in every way. But if I'm not careful, they find out anyway, which is really hateful.</p>
<p>It's been more than three weeks since the start of this semester, and there hasn't been a single wall newspaper. I was really happy! This morning, after finishing my first class, I walked past Zibin Hall on my way back to the dormitory, and I saw that "Short Wave Radio," which is known for its quick news and well-organized structure, was published again. "Splendor," sponsored by the preparatory department's association, still put on a face of impartiality and fairness and met with us. At the same time, there was also a "Sacrificial Sound," which was newly published, but I don't know who sponsored it. The content is really interesting. A Fang, who specializes in being a palace detective, also wrote a piece called "Eastern Palace Chronicles" and posted it there. Although this opening piece doesn't write about any facts, it has a very laughable vow. I copied it down:</p>
<p>South dormitory in front,</p>
<p>Zibin Hall behind,</p>
<p>If A Fang writes about the Eastern Palace again,</p>
<p>He'll turn into a monkey and be locked on the fourth floor.</p>
<p>Jia, I really wish he would immediately turn into a monkey and be locked on the fourth floor, so that he wouldn't write about our affairs and let everyone know. There's another piece called "Father and Son," which is a strange piece of writing. I read it for a long time and didn't know who he was talking about. I guess there's probably no such fact, and that "Jade Without Flaws" is just gossiping. Now I'm copying it down for you to see, do you think there is such a sinister person in the world?</p>
<p>"This is a fact, a truly meaningful fact. We don't think that if a father and son have different ideas, the son is unfilial. If the son's ideas are clearer than his father's, the so-called ideas of the latecomers, and the old father wants to scold his son for being unfilial, we will help the young man clear his name.</p>
<p>But if the son's ideas go astray, as if he has been tempted by the Communist Party and wants to fight with his father, this is the son's fundamental mistake. If a good young man is tempted, then we must attack the son for being improper.</p>
<p>A middle school student in our school, praising him in Director Chen's tone, 'This is a very capable young man.' In Director Chen's eyes, the so-called capable young man is nothing more than being able to run errands for him. I am very sure that before he was bewitched by the troublemakers, he was indeed a clear-headed person. He can write articles, take photos, and be able to handle matters for everyone. Honestly, when the Communist Party sees such a talent, they will definitely try to take him as a disciple. So they came up with a way to first give him sweet bait, hook the fat fish, easily get him, and then he escaped back.</p>
<p>This classmate... his father is a brigade commander in the National Army, with seven or eight concubines. According to Xiong, these many concubines are all trophies from winning battles. He is the only son, and he spends a lot of money at school. When the Zhongshan Western Restaurant opened, he treated guests for seven or eight yuan at a time. Most of the people he invites are female classmates, and this semester he has introduced seven or eight female classmates to Fudan.</p>
<p>He used to be the chairman of the student union, and it is said that Chen used his influence to get him elected. He has handled major events, and of course he spends a lot of money to seek pleasure with his girlfriends, and has never thought of red revolution. Once the good meat is in hand, how can they give it up? So the prole comrades came up with a sinister plan. The first step was to have him write a letter to his father, saying, 'Since our father and son have different opinions, it would be better to break off relations.' When the brigade commander father saw that his young brigade commander was being seduced, and his only heir, he was unwilling to let him run wild, so he sent his son a top-priority telegram, scolding him fiercely, and even appended the shocking sentence, 'Otherwise, I will stop sending money.' Indeed, this comrade is too stupid, and he didn't think of other ways. Perhaps I forgot that the prole comrades promised to give him other money. But the show has only reached this step, and the matter is not over. We have to see how capable prole Comrade × is, and whether he can defeat the brigade commander.</p>
<p>This is a fact. The second half of the facts, I will ask about it and then tell you. But if Comrade × goes into hiding, then the reporter can't talk about it anymore."</p>
<p>Jia, how do you feel after reading this? If this is a fact,</p>
<p>You want me to tell you about my life, but I'm telling you so much about wall newspapers. Are you happy to read it? In reality, I'm living a monotonous school life, and there's nothing to tell you. I only hope that you send me letters every day to liven up my life.</p>
<p>But I still have to tell you something strange, which is that the middle school principal saw that piece "Father and Son" and asked the secretary-general to investigate the wall newspaper, at least to have them correct it. It has now been turned over to the training office.</p>
<p>I don't have time during the day, and I'm afraid of being caught by my classmates and making a fuss, so I waited until they were in bed, lit a candle, and secretly wrote this letter to you. I originally had a lot more to say to you, but my sister is already awake, and I'm afraid she'll make so much noise that the whole room of classmates will know, so I'll have to stop writing. Fortunately, Saturday is coming again, and I'll still be waiting for you in the same park to go to the movies together.</p>
<p>I'm sending you a sweet kiss to say goodbye,</p>
<p>Ding, in Jiangwan.</p>
