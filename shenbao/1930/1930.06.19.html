<h3>美新稅則與證劵潮</h3>
<p>在今日世界之潮流中。貧乏之國。固惑困難。然苟其國内平靜無事。謹愼緊縮。亦不難安然過去。獨資産富厚之國。平時揮霍闊綽。規模宏大一時不易節約。故其處境反較貧乏爲難。弱點亦因以暴露矣。即以美國論。財力稱雄世界。但至近來。工人失業之數日增。金融市塲。屢起恐慌。政府感於財政之不易維持。預算之無法支配。乃亦不得不採取重稅主義。此次新稅則發表。一般民衆與農民。即大起反對。謂胡佛非特不能實踐宣言。保護利益而反加以危害。失業風潮。勢將益烈。同時各種證劵市面。忽又暴落。紐約電謂自去年十月大恐慌後。從無如此之甚加拿大交易所。亦受影響。其原因是否起於金融界之另有變動抑即爲新稅則案之反響。目前雖未判明。然其財政上弱點之暴露。已不可掩。且反對此稅則者。不僅國内之輿論。歐陸各國。亦感不利而羣起注意法報已有報復之言論英人亦謂遲早必生反響。今更加以證劵風潮。益令人視爲金融恐慌之證據。而藉爲反抗口實。世人每謂今日之資本主義。已至動摇之時。此或其一證歟。</p>

<h3>記大夏口琴音樂會覺民</h3>
<p>七日晚八時。本埠大夏大學口琴隊在四川路青年會大禮堂舉行第一次「口琴音樂會」。余久慕該隊盛名。亟欲一聆妙樂。乃約友前往。到塲時。來賓已有四百人之譜。未幾主席王祉偉先生致開會詞。略謂「口琴英文稱爲（哈莫呢加）（Harmonica）爲近代新興之樂器。音韻清雅。無異笙簧。而輕便簡易。罕有其匹。洵爲民衆必備之娱樂品。是故歐美日本莫不積極提倡。口琴音樂會之舉行。亦盛極一時。但在我國。今晚尚爲破天荒第一次。大夏口琴隊係口琴大家王慶勲君所組織。成立業已四年。屢在校内外表演。莫不大受聽衆之歡迎與讚賞。惟因創設伊始。一切尚未敢自信。還望諸君指敎云云旋即開始演奏。第一部第一節爲該隊合奏序曲「巴格達之奠長」。由王君親自指揮。樂聲鏗鏘。趣味悠永。次胡周淑安女士獨唱二闋。「森林中之鴿」。及胡適作之「樂觀」。並皆佳妙。其次爲口琴合奏「快樂之銅匠」進行曲。頗饒神趣。（四）爲李國綺女士之鋼琴獨奏。亦佳。（五）口琴二重奏「天堂與地獄」。王慶勲與劉因二君。（六）口琴合奏。爵土曲「安樂隊」及「東方舞」。演後休息十分鐘再奏。</p>
<p>第二部首爲口琴合奏。圓舞曲「多諾河水」。次李恩科先生獨唱「嫠婦心」。「西班牙舞」三曲。令人悠然神往。其次口琴二重奏。中間曲「長相思」。王慶勲林家驤君。再其次爲王慶勲君之口琴獨奏其自編之歌劇「卡門」一曲。幽婉抑揚。尤爲聽衆所傾倒。再奏「小夜曲」。亦極盡優美柔和</p>
<h3>陳英士先生幼年軼事伯英</h3>
<p>前清光緒十年之冬。一日。湖州海島有兒童八九人。嬉於其間。海島在城内。非眞海中之島也特一曠塲耳。戲稍久。時風勁草枯。一兒忽發奇想。覓得一火種。背風遍燃枯草。頃刻之間。風扇火。火乘風。羣兒踴躍於草地。火又逐羣兒之左右。天矯盤旋。一時大熾。羣兒大樂忽一兒仆於地。火勢即撲其身。衣服皆燃。羣兒大駭。遽狂奔去。此被火之兒。雖欲竭力呼救。顧口如被鉗。正危急問。又一兒冒火衝入。撲於此兒身上。抱之滾出。旣離火域。起視幸皆無傷。此冒火赴援之兒何人。即今日吾人所景仰之陳英士先生也。時纔八歲。語云。一寸之竹。即具凌霄之志。信不誣矣。友人張德齋云。</p>
<p>之致。演奏之後。余叩以該隊之組織。承王君解答如下。「本隊現分八部。（一）第一高音口琴。（二）第二高音口琴。（三）第一中音口琴。（四）第二中音口琴。（五）低音口琴。（六）最低音口琴。（七）重音口琴及（八）擊樂器。（如鈴鼓響板三角鐵等）略倣管絃樂之組織。所費極省。又便練習」云。</p>
<p>聞王君最近編著「最新口琴吹奏法」一書内除說明各種樂理奏法外。附有世界名國著名口琴隊之照片及中外名曲百條。并有蔡元培胡適之豐子愷諸先生之序文及題簽等。現已付印。不日即可出版。王君又鑒於國内優美口琴之缺乏。特向德國和來公同（MHohner）鑒製數種口琴。取名「眞善美」。均附有低「拉」音等。聞月底當可抵滬出售。</p>
<p>王君熱心提倡口琴。現在各大中小學。擔任口琴隊指導。成績均佳云。</p>
<h3>我所知之程先生（下）沈卓然</h3>
<p>先生嗜酒。每夕必赴小肆飲。然飲不逾量。曾無玉山頽倒時。余間與共飲。稍酣。輙誦少作。詩詞並皆佳妙。自謂晚歲惟酒是務。意中不復作詩人想。直欲追高陽酒徒耳。余戲言曰。然則先生百歲後。某當爲立石表彰。題「酒徒程訥之墓」六字何如。先生笑而頷之。以爲深識其意。且曰。異日吾蛻然逝去。子經此處。亦有重過黃公舊酒罏之感耶。余曰。山陽之笛。人琴之痛。惻愴悲凉。何能無動於中。不幸成讖。今果然矣。誠不忍數數過此肆也。</p>
<p>先生於人無不可交。而交之奇者。則往往屠沽役販。引爲友好。相對懽然。謂是等一秉樸眞。靡所飾詐。雖俗不害。縱非隱淪豪傑。亦當大勝翻雲覆雨。反眼若不相識者乎。</p>
<p>先生喜觀京劇。恒往某舞臺。雖同劇不嫌三四觀。時有坤伶某。色藝超絶。而名未彰。先生殊賞識之。而舞臺主略不加青眼。因語余曰。吾人處世。不遇良多。何必不如此伶。蓋有所感而云然。</p>
<p>余識先生在丁卯春仲。次秋乃與共事。偶有譚言。多所投合。由是形跡益親。儼然爲忘年交。而先生每當茶餘酒後。自道生平。兼及所遭。故能知其大概。拉雜書之。以見先生行事不同流俗。且欲其不即泯没也。并成一律。以誌哀悼。白首忠勤著。青藜學問精。空垂書卷業。誰識酒徒名。萍水三年聚。靈光一夕傾。撫棺遂隕涕悽斷薤歌聲。再哭程先生四絶云。見說墜樓驚亦疑。何因委化郤如斯。平生小友相知雅。欲仿招魂楚些辭。遺書亂疊案生塵。多少丹黃手澤新。從此老成凋謝去。青藜事業付何人。死别人間最愴情。濁醪三載幾同傾。酒星一夜歸躔次。涙眼模</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（三二）靈花</h3>
<p>二十八在基督女青年會講演。應其女幹事陳克杰之請也。此間天主基督敎所辦大小敎會學校機關甚多。一大敎堂費百萬。爲英人所建。昔耶蘇死時。弟子猶大因三十元賣其師。今後人粉飾死人墳墓。動以百千萬計。安往而非法理賽人乎。耶蘇本工匠之子。實行平民主義運動者。今帝王富人徒粉飾其形式。而云眞蘇可乎。故中外各地。有署眞耶蘇敎者頗多。太原有之。南洋亦有之。余在各地。耶敎友人必請演講。余講耶蘇。乃一不殺人主義者。各友均大贊成。謂今藉宗敎以殺人。眞非耶徒矣。雖然。無論天主耶蘇到處均辦學校不解佛徒何以無此智識。可惜</p>
<p>二十九。中央精武體育會盧偉昌來請。到其會演講。其主席爲女子。乃黃兆珪律師之夫人。名吳蓉芝。盧手創精武二十餘年。分會中外四十餘埠。四十餘萬人。去年余在廣州分會演講。會長熊長卿君。允爲介紹全部精武。加人坤化泰平運動。今盧即爲對衆宣言。并述其精武之意。乃鍛練身心。以戰勝瑕境。非逞暴力者。且太極拳發源於周易之太極。與余坤乾之本于泰卦。正爲同源。均創造東方文化之同志。當盧初倡辦此會。乃繼續其師霍元甲力士遺志。一洗東方病夫之恥。而初時人不明了。或詆爲拳匪。今各埠男女精武會林立。音樂藝術彬彬。所辦學校成績亦多。且各女精武特爲發達云。余念人生應有高尚娱樂。以調和身心。不正則邪。今此地藝術娱樂機關太少。而所謂俱樂部者。凡二百餘處。俱樂部大抵爲富人之行樂所。内鴉片馬將。或琵琶仔。（即妓女或賣藝女）以此消耗精神。故民族自治能力。毫無表現。以百分九十以上之民族。坐受人之管理。而不可振興。皆乏體育藝術高尚娱樂之故也。不但海外。即内地各處亦然。不過南洋需高尚娱樂爲尤甚耳。吾甚希望其推廣之。</p>
<p>糊認不清。玉京僊去有何悲。應被先生笑我痴。今日黃公罏畔過。不堪和涙寫新詩鵑按先生爲愚畏友。年來共事大東。獲益良多。其生平校書。心細如髮。至可欽服。嘗私稱之爲「校讐之王」。今忽以慘死聞。言念疇曩。爲之泫然。</p>
<p>出版界消息柴米夫妻爲何公超君近著。作者對於平民文學素有研究。此書全篇用淺近的白話方言諺語構成。描寫失業者之痛苦。與現代婚姻制度之缺點。文字淺顯而描寫深刻。最適宜於粗識文字者之閱讀。書由上海四馬路春潮書局代發行。每册一角五分。爲普及起見購五册以上九折。十册以上八五折云。</p>

<h3>歐游通訊（五十九）劉海粟</h3>
<p>法國秋季沙龍SalonofAutomne1929</p>
<p>（二）秋季沙龍的略史</p>
<p>官府的藝術Officialart是墮落的藝術。是没有價值的藝術。這句說話。已經成了現代人的口頭禪了。所以法國的春季沙龍和英國的皇家美術院。是没有人注意的。因爲它裏面没有好的東西。在先。法國春季沙龍裏面展覽的東西都是官學派Acadamy的作品。絶無現代的精神。充滿着死的陳腐的感覺。經過高爾佩的一度的反對。後來又經過瑪奈Manet莫奈Monet等一輩印象派畫家的革命運動。它的勢力就一落千丈了。</p>
<p>在一千八百八十四年十二月修拉GeorgeSurat1860-1991西湼克ParlSignac1863等以作品屢爲春季沙龍所摒棄。他們就創立了獨立展覽會。所有新的創作盡最收錄。而修剌。西潯克。克羅士之作品尤爲人注目。當時遂有新印象派之産生。這也不過無名的青年畫家們的集會。然而奇怪。從此同志逐漸加增。而隱然引起法蘭西新藝術的運動。在那時候印象派新印象派的藝術是已經達到發展的境界上了。</p>
<p>概括說一句。印象主義新印象主義都是種感覺的寫實主義。主張直接描寫映在視覺上的自然外相。所以排斥「固有色」的觀念丨丨印象派更注重時時變化色相的光線和空氣。新印象派注意裝飾的效果。丨丨他們的方法專依賴感覺。詳細分析。和當時科覺的世界觀十分調和。但到十九世紀末葉。那樣的世界觀漸漸摇動。對實在的内面的憬憧便萌芽了。同時美術上也就有反印象主義的傾向。於是一輩醒覺的作家更向開闢的路上進行。在於一九○六年就有秋季沙龍的誕生。集合其中的同志們。就是後來被人稱做「野獸羣」Faryes的一輩人</p>
<p>有許多主張很不一致的作家們。於一九○三年的秋季。在小宫的地窖内集會了陳列着各人的作品。經過了幾個星期以後。有了地位的大師也來加入了。當時被大衆目爲狂人的夏丹FrantzJourdain就鼓舞着勇氣産生了秋季沙龍。從簡陋的地窖裏開始的秋季沙龍。從此隔年在大宫開會一回。經過了幾年以後。勢力竟就逐漸擴大。屢次展覽着偉大的新創的作品。遂隱然成爲從法國的藝術思潮。擴大而轉動着世界的藝術思潮這模樣了。但是。於此也有種原因。助成了這偉大的藝術運動的。</p>
<p>當時的法蘭西藝壇。對於光色炫耀的印象派已經有些厭倦了。這新的團體的集合也是自然的結果。而會員之中。又來了瑪諦斯。來了逢娜。來了梵鈍根。來了特朗來了佛拉孟克。這些人們。現在已經成就了永久的美術史上的人物了。而在當時。則全是無名無産的畫家。并且被人看做不純潔的一羣野獸那樣。興起法蘭西二十世紀初葉的魔術運動的他們。是從前的歐洲的美術家所夢想不到的大革命。</p>

<h3>我們爲什麽演</h3>
<p>莎士比亞的戲顧仲彝</p>
<p>世界上有兩種天才一種是想像特别發達的一種是理智特别發達的想像特别發達的就是詩人他能在現實世界的上面幻造出一個平常人所見不到的猜不出的仙境理智特别發達的就是哲學家他能在紊亂錯綜的現實世界裏用銳敏的眼光找出相互的因緣人生的眞義和事物的眞理歷代有許多大詩人和大哲學家但是要找個想像理智兼備的天才那就不容易了莎士比亞之所以被尊爲世界文壇的萬古怪傑戲劇文學的首領就因爲他是想像理智同樣發展的大天才他有了優美的想像使他的戲美得好像一朶鮮妍的花和諧得好像一曲妙歌温柔得好像一首婉轉的情詩一方面他有深刻的理智使他的戲堅固得好像磐石深刻得好像海水準確得好像科學的觀察銳利得好像鋒利的快刀他戲中有精美的詩詩中有深刻的戲他散文中有詩意詩句中反映出人生的眞義來人物一個個脫蛻而出各俱各的神情各有各的性格各是各的風調複雜的世界他一把爪住了一絲也不漏掉複雜的人生他却看得清清楚楚說得明明白白他佈局的嚴蜜結構的緊凑穿插的得當眞可謂天衣無縫工同天然</p>
<p>莎士比亞演「威尼斯商人」說的是英國話做的是伊大利的故事從十六世紀到現在舞台不知改變了多少次戲劇上的潮流主義也不知換了多少遍但莎士比亞還不斷的出演於世界偉大的劇場研究的一年增加一年改良的一年進步一年加之最近舞台裝置的新發明燈光的新方法使莎士比亞的戲在舞台上更顯得牠的偉大他的無比欣賞莎士比亞的人一天天多起來現在在歐美莎士比亞的戲竟成了西洋文化敎育的重要部分不懂莎士比亞的戲的在歐美是件極以爲羞辱的事</p>
<p>我們聽到莎士比亞這名氏已經好幾十年了有的讀過他幾齣劇本有的唸過那查理拉穆的「莎氏樂府本事」有的目覩敎會學堂裏演過莎士比亞的戲但是在眞正中國舞台上認眞的忠實的講中國話的莎士比亞劇本可就没有看過</p>
<p>我們是提倡藝術劇的團體先從莎士比亞入手自認是穩健的途徑我們抱着極大的雄心要把眞正的莎士比亞介紹到中國來嘗試的我們不敢自翊只求諸位看過了給我們一個忠實的批評使我們知道走的路錯了没有（完）</p>

<h3>關紫蘭女士個展别紀</h3>
<p>盧夢殊</p>
<p>我是不懂畫的但是我很喜歡看人家的畫却又不喜歡看今人或古人所作的山水畫甚麽意思我可不必說記得幾年前我因爲某種機會和在任務上的某項問題訪某老先生於其私邸某老先生以我能文自必能夠觀畫遂出示所作山水大大小小十餘幕雲樹烟霞層蠻疊嶂古樸渾厚未嘗不足一觀但我却摇頭不語說這些不過是澄墨淋漓非我所心愛的藝術某老先生聞而大恚駡我是荒傖之夫思想惡俗不足以言風雅我遜謝不遑說我祇愛藝術丨丨有民族精神的藝術</p>
<p>月前陳抱一先生給我一封信說關紫蘭女士將開個人油畫展覽了約我去參觀並在那兒會晤我與陳先生許久不曾見面了雖則同居上海却好像遠隔天涯除了信息之外兩年來孩都没得空兒去飭他於他的畫室裏因爲彼此在同一的水平線上而分道揚鑣各人去努力各人的工作所以碰面的機會就很少簡實像不相認識的一樣然而陳先生的熱情實在可感雖然不能常常謀面但至少隔幾時就寫信給我問問近况如何我呢唔慚愧得很除了工作之外還要掙扎於生活之途十字架愈背愈重了對於友情冷淡了許多說起來眞是萬分的對不住朋友</p>
<p>關於關紫蘭女士的個展旣然陳先生預先約我了關女士也特郵柬邀雖則近來心理有點變態加着些冷淡的心情但無論如何關女士的個展是要去看的因爲關女士是廣東人廣東人在上海努力於藝術的實在不多而且我對於地方色彩特别濃厚時時總稱讚我們自已廣東人即如我寫小說也常常的不期然而然的搬運着許許多多敎人不懂的廣東土産比方說在「阿串姐」裏就有給傳彦長兄一見大笑的吃嗚龜如此關女士的個展就不可不去更何况在那兒有等着相見的</p>
<p>終於是一個機會在星期日的午前得以從容不迫地到華安八樓去但是出了寫字樓門口不由得不使我翻憶起舊日底凄然因爲風片雨絲像煞曩時與震遐徘徊於天妃宫橋畔茫然好比一對迷羊的時候如今震遐已是以藝術家而作荷槍佩刃的軍人了過慣了都會裏油與熱的生活一變而去吃那汗雨血花烟硝火燄蝕遍了的大麥饅頭有民族思想的藝術家當然有時會得有這一種舉動至於我生活愈轉得五花八門早就給我不願意而必然地抑制住靈魂的狂呌了影事前塵眞令人有無限的迴憶到華安八樓了在門口簽了名了入到展覽室裏了給陳抱一夫人一眼見着了忙拉陳先生過來紹呼了握手完了陳師母向我道喜了陳先生又稅了幾句歉的話了介紹給我見關女士了關女士我是常常見面的但見面總是陌路相逢因　一向不曾經人介紹過也一向不曾直接請握過這一次相對鞠躬變爲朋友還是破題兒第一遭啊然而第一遭就有不可不說的印象了她丨丨關女士這時候態度雍容極了微笑中流動着銀星似的變眸在告訴人們幾年來在藝術上努力的精神内心已有無限的熱情底存在望去豐腴有致便就是日本藝術家中川紀元所喻爲「中國的牡丹花」不能不使我再稱讚一回我們的廣東人也</p>
<p>丨盧先生我們一起拍照陳抱一先生說</p>
<p>這時他們忙着拍照陳先生於怱忙中就向我說了這一聲我接受了自去觀畫讓他們排列兒在一角裏拍去終逃不過陳師母的慧眼呼了一聲就給陳先生拉了我過去我立在陳先生的後頭在拍時心裏自忖這幾日瘦得可憐像這樣一枝竹竿兒似地不曉得會不會影響到他們的全體但自忖還是自忖拍是終給滬江拍去了</p>
<p>拍完了照之後見着舊同事杜式恒先生杜先生是富是强烈的民族精神的人筆底異常强烈而且又是懂畫的這來自然是投其所好不久又見着白鵝兩位健將方雪鴣與陳秋草兩先生便合夥兒去瀏覽鑒賞關女士的畫在各畫上使我們與中川紀元有同樣的感覺</p>
<p>「無論從她那一幅作品上也能由其大膽的筆致和絢爛的酌色中感到她最個性的强烈的芬芳者」</p>
<p>的確的關女士的作品直爽有膽但是她不僅表現他個性的强烈同時代表了我們民族光明的新精神</p>
<p>青看完了之後陳先生又給我介紹葉先生葉先生我在去年新雅茶會時見過的不過已不記得名字了葉先生新從日本回來我就問他日本文壇和藝壇的近　她說没有我們中國這們寂寞並且熱烈地在　高和改變它的趨勢因爲日本會集多不單調又不像我們中國的藝術家似的每個人都受到生活底彷徨都没有全時間努力於藝術工作所以兩都就不能相提並論了</p>
<p>談話完後葉先生自去觀畫我和陳先生到另一室裏傾談陳先生說丨</p>
<p>丨關女士這一次的個展總算成功雖則報紙上預先没有甚麽宣傳但外界來觀者前昨兩日爲數不少而我們的老友如傳彦長·朱應鵬·徐蔚南等都已於昨日來過講到關女士的畫一方面也見成功筆致很强是一般人可以見到的</p>
<p>丨是的麤豪而有膽量純不似女性所作而在沈悶的藝術之園中有這一次個展着實是打起黃浦江上的潮頭不祇作爲今年藝術界不寂寞底點綴我還希望關女士這次個展之後接着的便是你老兄的個展</p>
<p>丨假如有好作品我也很願意舉行我的個展</p>
<p>丨你自然有好作品存在着的祗不過你自已太謙了點而已</p>
<p>丨</p>
<p>丨晞陽藝術學院現在成績如何</p>
<p>丨晞陽學校方面已停止進行藝術團體仍在努力因爲專注重於一方面爲力較易而致功宏若兩面進行則致力量單薄了反不易有所成就</p>
<p>丨是的你這方針着實改得不差而且專致力於藝術團體的上頭也容易給人見到成績用力點也集中不致渙散陳先生點首稱是彼此呼了一回香烟我就售辭了在歸途細雨着面凉風吹衣蕭然又使起回憶但關女士的人與畫深刻地印在腦子裏頭細味一回不禁再嘖嘖地稱讚丨</p>

<p>第四十三章學藝復興期以後的意大利文學</p>
<p>使我們的苦輕减的你永久活着罷阿阿可愛的神聖的藝術</p>
<p>我們不幸的人們的慰安呵雷奥帕第</p>
<p>在意大利文學的黃金時代塔索是最後的偉大的天才他及他的時代以後意大利的藝術全部衰頽下去直至全歐羅巴之上初現了新學藝復興期的十九世紀爲止没有復活過來當介於其間的十七世紀及十八世紀文學在英吉利和法蘭西非常興旺這是因爲這兩國縱有一切的困厄但在政治上經濟上是有力的這緣故國的繁榮與其藝術或個人的繁榮與其創造之間有着什麽關係我們不能確切地說然而要生出創造力來肉體底健康似乎是必要的而那創造力也就是生出藝術來的罷二百年之間意大利因内戰而分裂且被外敵所擊破了曾經算是强大的那些都市共和國已經大家弄得筋疲力畫了意大利精神枯萎凋謝便努力要存活于過去的榮光之上了佩脫拉克及其他的學藝復興期的巨匠的模倣者全體之中没有一個人産出十行的詩來</p>
<p>然而那精神没有全然死去在我們來到十九世紀的第三回的再生之前是有幾個非提及不可的重要的人物的在學藝復興期的黃昏之中有過兩三個有才能的人物然而在他們之中没有發出眞的聖火的閃光來一個是瓜里泥他的PastorFido（「忠實的牧人」）繼承了技巧底的亞加狄亞的傳統被讀于歐羅巴的各宫廷兩世紀間影響及於敷白粉·潑香水·穿絲襪的牧歌的可愛的文學有着較銳的才能的人物是塔索尼他譏笑佩脫拉克的模倣者而他的諷剩喜劇SecchiaPaoita（被竊的提桶）雖然久已過時現在也還有着一種可笑味塔索尼於我們不合適了但也重要到足以指揮近代意大利的大詩人卡杜契的編輯上的勞作的然而從塔索至阿爾飛亞里這兩世紀之間在似乎浸潤於詩的諸時代似的那光明的半島上則什麽純正的詩也没有</p>
<p>末期意大利學藝復興期的力是在那散文之中在白魯諾康帕内拉及伽利略等等哲學者之中我們不能將這些壯大的思想家的作品來多說一番是遺憾的事然而他們較之一般文學底藝術倒是屬於專門底哲學的可是哲學和文學的境界線劃在何處誰可以說呢白魯諾及康帕内拉寫過詩那當然是被忘的了他們的力乃在他們的散文他們的倫理思想由敎會當局又由那使最美的思想有不少無人知曉半被埋没的冷落所長久抑壓的白魯諾在最近五十年間竟被認爲哲學上的巨人之一了他的主要的思想便是全宇宙是一個有生氣的存在這句話丨丨待到若干世紀之後由德意志的哲學者費希奈爾美妙地加以發揮的思想伽利略是異常的天才科學者·文學者他同哥白尼在一起作爲近世天文學的創設者爲我們所知恐怕許多讀者即使意大利人也没有知道作爲意大利散文的巨匠之一的他罷蒐集起他的論文及書翰來不過是最近四十年間的事這也不過用意大利語的而已以我所知這個可驚的人物的文章的英譯還没有意大利對於物理學·醫學·電氣及其他的科學的供獻的故事還有待於寫述在那故事中伽利略是最傑出的人物是從希臘及羅馬的巨匠以降意大利思想的長的直系中最煊赫的個人這遺産意大利直至她的孩子們開始到德意志的大學去的最近代爲止是没有污損地保持着的他們到德意志的大學去没有學到德意志的思想的力和淵深却學了牠的笨重的愚昧其一個例子便是最著名的現存意大利哲學者及批評家克羅斯他是濃重到幾乎難以卒讀的</p>

<h3>The New US Tariff and Securities Panic</h3>
<p>In the current global trend, poor countries are indeed facing difficulties. However, if a country is peaceful and has no internal conflicts, and is cautious and thrifty, it is not difficult to weather the storm. However, wealthy countries, which are accustomed to extravagance and have large-scale projects, find it difficult to economize in a short period of time. Therefore, their situation is more difficult than that of poor countries, and their weaknesses are exposed. Take the United States as an example. Its financial strength is the strongest in the world, but recently, the number of unemployed workers has been increasing daily, and the financial markets have repeatedly experienced panics. The government, feeling that it is not easy to maintain its finances and that the budget cannot be controlled, has had to adopt a heavy tax policy. The announcement of the new tariff has aroused strong opposition from the general public and farmers, who say that Hoover has not only failed to fulfill his promises to protect their interests, but has instead harmed them, and that the unemployment trend will intensify. At the same time, the market for various securities has suddenly plummeted. The New York telegram said that it has not been so severe since the great panic in October of last year. The Canadian Stock Exchange has also been affected. Whether the reason is due to other changes in the financial sector or a reaction to the new tariff, it is not yet clear. However, the exposure of its financial weaknesses cannot be concealed. Moreover, opposition to this tariff is not limited to domestic public opinion. Countries in Europe also feel disadvantaged and are paying close attention. French newspapers have already made statements of retaliation, and the British also say that there will be repercussions sooner or later. Now, coupled with the securities panic, it is even more regarded as evidence of financial panic and used as a pretext for resistance. People often say that today's capitalism has reached a time of upheaval, and this may be one proof.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Customs Issue</h3>
<p>Representatives of Foreign Banking Groups Exchange Views</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, representatives of the countries that signed the Boxer Protocol and representatives of the Rehabilitation Loan Banking Group exchanged views at the British Legation on the issue of taking over the Tianjin Customs. The embassies, on the basis that the Chinese government has initial tariff autonomy, generally adopted a cautious attitude and did not easily protest. The banking group focused on not hindering the principal and interest of the debt. As a result, they telegraphed their respective governments and head offices to ask for instructions. The relevant banking groups had a meeting on May 2, saying that Yan's statement was limited to changing the 2.5% surtax to a deposit, so no protests were raised at that time. Now that it has been fully taken over, they have to ask the head office for instructions and decide on a solution after receiving a reply. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US New Tariff Law</h3>
<p>President Signs into Effect</p>
<p>Relief for Farmers Backfires</p>
<p>Stock Market First Affected</p>
<p>Exports of China and Japan are Both Disadvantaged</p>
<p>Likely to Invite Retaliation from Other Countries</p>
<p>Reuter's Washington, 17th: The US new tariff law was approved by President Hoover today. The entire law will take legal effect at midnight tonight. Hoover's signing of the tariff law this time is to fulfill his promise to the public to revise the tariff law during his election. Initially, it was planned to end the special meeting of the parliament on this case, but it was delayed again and again until today, when the regular meeting ended. The original intention of submitting this case was to provide relief to farmers, but the current result has been strongly attacked by a group of people, saying that it not only fails to fully protect farmers but also harms the interests of farmers and ordinary people, especially the Republicans in the western states who oppose it most strongly. Yesterday, the stock market suddenly declined, causing panic in all quarters. Many said that after the establishment of the new tariff law, other countries may take concerted retaliatory actions, which will intensify the unemployment trend in the United States. However, those who support this case said that the stock market turmoil was not affected by the new tariff law.</p>
<p>National Society, Paris, 17th: The "Future" newspaper, which has a close relationship with the Undersecretary of Economic Affairs, published a shocking article today, asking the French to boycott American goods in response to the American increase in tariffs, because this move by the United States is harmful to Europe, and especially to France. In addition, most newspapers in Paris also advocated all-European tariff and economic cooperation to deal with the United States.</p>
<p>The amendment to raise tariffs was passed by a majority in the Senate on the 13th and by the House of Representatives on the 14th amid fierce opposition from countries around the world. Generally speaking, the tariff rate was increased by about 20%, and as a result, both China and Japan were disadvantaged. The goods affected by Japan's trade with the United States are beans, aquatic products, and others, with an average tax increase of more than 30%.</p>
<p>Reuter's New York, 17th: Five merchant ships rushed to the port of New York before the new tariff law took effect in order to avoid new taxes. The Arlington Pike carried French lace worth one million US dollars. The new tariff rules greatly increased the price of this lace. In addition, import and export merchants have re-registered existing stocks to avoid the new tax rates. The taxes paid to get goods out of storage in recent days have reached 17 million US dollars. Afterwards, the prices of various imported goods will gradually rise. According to estimates by opponents of the new tariff law, the burden on American consumers will increase by 1,000,000,000 US dollars per year.</p>

Yesterday, British Prime Minister MacDonald mentioned the financial situation at the unemployment meeting, and his remarks have aroused great attention in political and business circles. The British Prime Minister said that something happened in New York yesterday, and this will have repercussions here sooner or later. Since the end of last week, rumors of financial difficulties have been circulating in London. Today, because the prices on the stock exchange have fallen again, these rumors have become more powerful.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 17th: The Indian government reported on the general situation in India in the week before June 14, saying that the situation in the Northwest Frontier Province is now stable.

Someone in North Xia Hua carried clothes stained with blood, obtained from local butchers, to the border in a basket, using this as propaganda against the British. The Afredi tribe attacked the border and were bombed by British aircraft, killing 80 and injuring more than 300. It also said that the activities of the Indian Kuomintang members are now gradually subsiding, and in various places, they are gradually changing their original intentions and openly disapproving of the non-violent resistance movement.</p>

It is truly grateful for the promotion of world peace and the increase of human well-being and the interests of the overall national situation. This morning, at Tokyo Station, I admired the energetic appearance of Chief Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki, and at the same time, I heard tens of thousands of people shouting long live, which made people feel an indescribable sense of gratitude.

<p>Reuters, London, 17th: Conservative Party member Herbert asked the government in the Lower House today to pay attention to the recent events in Tianjin and the report that the Tianjin Customs Commissioner has taken refuge in the British Consulate. Deputy Foreign Minister Dalton replied that the newspaper report that Xin Bosen has been appointed as the Tianjin Customs Commissioner has been confirmed by officialdom, and the government is currently investigating the entire incident. Anmon, Parliamentary Secretary of the Navy, claimed that British merchant ships in Chinese waters use guards instead of soldiers. The annual cost of this measure is approximately 80,000 yuan, which is borne by the shipping companies concerned.</p>

<p>Important News from the Central Propaganda Department</p>
<h3>Letter to Compatriots in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi and Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department recently issued a "Letter to Compatriots in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi and Guangdong on Eradicating the Traitors Zhang and Gui". The original text is as follows: Compatriots from all walks of life in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi and Guangdong, the claws of the Communist reorganisation faction, the traitors Zhang Fakui and Gui family warlords Li Baihuang and other rebels have recently brought a large group of bandit communists and rushed into Hunan like wolves. The rebels, because they have been burning, killing, looting, and plundering in Guangxi for several months and have repeatedly been ambushed and severely suppressed by the Central Government's punitive expeditionary army, and have been almost completely wiped out and fallen into desperation, took the risk of taking advantage of the opportunity of the Central Government to concentrate its efforts on attacking the rebels Yan and Feng to start a desperate struggle and suddenly fled north to Hunan in an attempt to disrupt the rear and respond to Yan and Feng and plunder wealth to fill their insatiable desires. Fortunately, the Central Army used swift means to surround the rebels, who had nowhere to escape and had become turtles in a jar. The time to completely eliminate them is just around the corner. The compatriots who have suffered from the various crimes of harming the party and the country and the brutal acts of slaughtering and trampling in the past must not have forgotten. If our compatriots understand the crimes committed by the rebels, they should unite and help the Central Army to eliminate the rebels as soon as possible, so as to avoid the disaster of chickens and dogs being restless again in a country that has just settled down. A brief account of the past deeds of the rebels, hoping that our compatriots will deeply reflect.</p>
<p>The Disaster in Hubei: When the communists gathered in Wuhan in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the traitor Zhang became the executioner of the Communist Party who slaughtered the compatriots of Hubei Province. On the one hand, the rebel used force to protect the Communist Party from cannibalizing the good people, and on the other hand, he relied on the fierce flame of the Communist Party to seize and plunder and expand his personal power. The compatriots of Hubei Province have suffered greatly from abuse and are still talking about tigers with fear. After the rebel Zhang fled south from Hubei, the Gui family warlords came in and seized Wuhan, spreading their cronies, sheltering corrupt officials, suppressing and trampling on farmers, workers, and young people, levying exorbitant taxes, and wantonly arresting and killing innocent people. The misery of trampling was no less than that of the rebel Zhang. Only after the Central Government drove them out could this kind of pain be relieved.</p>
<p>The Disaster in Jiangxi: When the rebel Zhang fled from Hubei to Jiangxi, he recruited a group of expelled communists and instigated the famous communists He Long and Ye Ting to make trouble in Nanchang, resulting in the "July 31st" bloody red terror. The rebel then used the name of suppressing the communists to follow and pursue them south. Wherever he passed along the way, such as Ji'an and Ganzhou, he gloriously killed, plundered, and looted the villages. Later, he secretly colluded with the communist bandits Zhu and Mao to provide a large amount of weapons and ammunition. As a result, the communist bandits became more rampant and have not been eliminated to this day. The communist disasters suffered by our compatriots in Jiangxi Province repeatedly were directly and indirectly caused by the rebel.</p>
<p>The Disaster in Guangdong: In the winter of the 16th year, the rebel Zhang and the Gui family warlords competed for the territory of Guangdong Province and fought each other. The rebel Zhang colluded with the communist bandits Ye He to cause riots in various places in the Dongjiang River and condoned the activities of the Communist Party, resulting in the unprecedented burning and killing tragedy in Guangzhou. The pioneers of the Communist Party's riots were the rebel's training regiment. The Gui family took the opportunity to eliminate the communists and gained the support of various armies in Guangdong, driving the rebel Zhang out of the country and taking the opportunity to extend its poisonous wrist to Guangdong, monopolizing military and political power, intercepting central taxes, and searching and extorting to the extreme. Its perverse actions were even worse than those of the rebel Zhang. In short, the rebel Zhang and the Gui family warlords are the greatest enemies of our compatriots in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>The Disaster in Guangxi: The Gui family warlords previously occupied Guangxi and were tyrannical and arbitrary, just like the local emperor Yan Xishan inside Niangziguan. Heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies were constantly emerging, and banknotes were issued indiscriminately to absorb cash. A group of corrupt officials also helped the wicked to do evil and rampant in the cities and villages. The people of Guangxi, under the trampling of iron hooves, resented to the bone and dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Later, the Central Government punished them, and their ferocity was slightly reduced. Last winter, when the rebel Zhang fled to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, he reconciled with the Gui family through the mediation of the reorganization faction, recruited scattered soldiers and bandits, and resisted stubbornly. The communist bandits rose up in large numbers and carried out massacres in the areas of western and northern Guangxi. The cruelty was comparable to the red disaster in the two lakes before. Today, countless communist bandits are still entrenched in the area of ​​Baise Longzhou, all of whom were recruited by the rebels. To this day, the people of Guangxi are still unable to live in peace and happiness (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Fellow Villagers in Beijing Beg for Relief</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Fellow Villagers in Beijing organized the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association. The following is a record of their petition to the National Disaster Relief Association and a circular telegram to fellow villagers in various places:</p>
<p>Petition: It has been found that since the 16th year, after the troops of Jiangxi Province left the province, bandits have been lurking and tracking. There have been campaigns every year, but they have never been eliminated. They have secretly grown stronger and are now rampant. In the more than 80 counties, it is difficult to find one without bandit disasters. Zhu and Mao have been running rampant in southern Jiangxi, Shao has been ravaging eastern Jiangxi, Peng Dehuai has been appearing and disappearing in western Jiangxi, and other small groups of dozens or hundreds of people are countless. Therefore, the Nanshan Railway has been cut off repeatedly, and the city of Wuning County has also been captured. These are all done by small groups. In the past three or four years, wherever bandits have passed, farms have been abandoned in the fields, merchants have stopped in the markets, and the scene of desolation is everywhere. Even in remote villages, where bandits have not yet arrived, tenants do not pay rent, and the rich are not safe in their homes. Therefore, families above the middle class in the past have fled and concentrated in the cities, and the people with small assets have to become bandits. This is the reality of Jiangxi. The people who are trapped in the bandit area and associated with the bandits cannot be saved without suppressing the bandits and clearing the villages. The people who are concentrated in the cities have been cut off from the supply of food in the countryside. Nanchang, Jiujiang, Raozhou, etc., are all buying rice from Shanghai. The counties above Yu Kuangqian in eastern Jiangxi have long been cut off from the water and land transportation to Nanchang and have to purchase miscellaneous grains from Shanghai via Quzhou and Hangzhou. Jiangxi has always been a rice-producing area. Recently, the price of rough rice in Nanchang and eastern Jiangxi has exceeded 20 yuan per stone, and there is no market even if you have money. The villagers have come to report that it is still more than two months before the new rice is on the market, and the local officials are busy going to the province to fight and no one cares about the bandits. The county magistrate is still in a hurry to collect taxes and grains, and the farmers want to steal time to plant, but they have no seeds to collect. They have repeatedly submitted petitions to the government requesting exemption from taxes and subsidies for seeds to avoid another famine next year, but no one has responded. The same pain in the heart of the comrades. Jiangxi's tragic situation is related to the safety of the entire province and cannot be ignored. Therefore, the comrades in Beijing organized the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association. In addition to presenting the government to handle the suppression of bandits and the clearing of villages, we specially request the conference to quickly take administrative measures to either issue national funds or raise private funds. Today, giving one liter of millet more is to leave one more life for Jiangxi. The comrades dare to plead for our more than 30 million undead fathers, elders, brothers. We are earnestly submitting the petition to the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association of the Beijing Disaster Relief Committee, Guo Tong, Fu Dingsheng, Zhang Yuantong, Tang Benyin, Xu Buyuan, Xia Jingli, Xia Chengmian, Zhan Keyu, Yuan Peicheng, Huang Xuyu, Liu Liangxun, Liu Shishun, Chen Jianxiao, Chen Rui, Lu Han, Zhang Yuxun, Chen Tao, Cai Yuanhai, Wu Mai, Wu Mulan, Chen Wei, Cao Jianjin</p>
<p>Circular Telegram to the Fellow Villagers' Associations in Various Ports and the Fellow Villagers Inside and Outside the Province</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Public Witness: Since the 16th year, bandits and communist bandits have been secretly growing and have now spread throughout the province. The number of counties that have been affected by bandits has long exceeded half of the total. If we seek for an area of ​​peace and quiet, there are almost no one or two out of the more than 80 counties. The good and weak people either abandon their homes and flee to avoid disaster, or they join the group to share food in order to survive. They force the burning of field vouchers and destroy the boundaries between fields in order to implement the system of dividing land and inciting robbery and killing. Society has long been without order, and the people have long lost their peace. The people of the province have always relied on agriculture for their livelihood, accounting for more than 90% of the population. The situation has been like this for years, and agriculture cannot be cultivated, and industry and commerce have also lost their jobs. As a result, the place that used to produce the most rice has now become a place where the price of rice is more than 20 yuan per load, which is even higher than that of Beijing and Shanghai. The villages are in distress and gather in the cities to steal peace. In recent days, Nanchang has become a city where there is no market for money. In Shang Yu Kuang and other places in eastern Jiangxi, the water and land transportation to the provincial capital has long been cut off, so they go to Quzhou and Hangzhou to seek food. There are probably many other similar cases. If they live in a place that is plagued by bandits, they will be hungry if they travel. If they do not seek relief quickly, they will drive the people to chaos. The comrades are concerned about the disasters in their hometown and cannot sleep peacefully. Therefore, they gathered the fellow villagers in Beijing to set up the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association, on the one hand, they petitioned the authorities to quickly handle the clearing of villages and eliminate bandits, and on the other hand, they tried to raise donations to prepare for relief. They were afraid that their hearts would be weak and their strength would be weak. They admired the masses for their respect for their homeland and their sympathy. They dared to appeal with sincerity. They hoped that the fellow villagers inside and outside would unite or provide practical help, or plan strategies, or promote justice, or contribute from their personal pockets, or entrust the begging bowls from door to door, or send people with official hats. They only seek to sweep away the bandits and rescue the fellow villagers from water and fire, or even give them a pot of soup to raise the starving people on the road. Then, our humble efforts today will leave more unmolested people in our hometown in the future. In the area of ​​a special heart, I hereby appeal to the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association in Beijing, Guo Tong, and others kowtow.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing Grain Reserve Funds in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>Based on reports from commissioners in various counties.</p>
<p>Regulations are established and orders issued for compliance.</p>
<p>In various counties of Jiangsu Province, the mismanagement and embezzlement of grain reserves, traditionally managed by designated officials, have been unavoidable. The Civil Affairs Department has repeatedly received directives from the central government to supervise and rectify these issues in each county, especially given the frequent disasters and famines, making this task extremely urgent. Previously, six general principles for planning grain reserves for disaster relief were established, and special personnel were dispatched to each county to thoroughly investigate the misuse or embezzlement of grain funds over the years. Based on the combined reports from various commissioners, the key points are as follows: Most of the grain reserves are located in the southern counties of Jiangsu, while the northern counties have fewer reserves or no grain reserve system at all. Furthermore, many of the original granaries in various counties have been repurposed for other uses, and the misuse and embezzlement of grain funds are widespread. Before implementing grain reserves, the first step should be to recover the granaries and pursue compensation for embezzled funds. Currently, many counties have successively received orders to recover granaries and implement the purchase, storage, and price stabilization of grain. The Civil Affairs Department has specifically compiled a statistical table based on the information collected by various commissioners, detailing the embezzlement or misuse of grain reserve funds in each county of the province. The current county magistrates are instructed to be responsible for thoroughly investigating and pursuing compensation within a specific timeframe and to propose reorganization measures. These measures were submitted to the Provincial Government Committee for approval, and the Civil Affairs Department issued instructions to each county magistrate yesterday, ordering them to strictly comply with the implementation. The following are the reorganization measures:</p>
<p>(1) For the seventeen counties where the names of the embezzlers or the agencies that misused the grain funds, as well as the amount of grain funds misused, have been identified, including Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Nanhui, Jinshan, Chuansha, Haimen, Kunshan, Siyang, Yancheng, Taixian, Suqian, Yizheng, Huaian, Liyang, Danyang, and Jurong, the reorganization measures are as follows: 1. The current county magistrate is responsible for pursuing compensation from the original handlers and the original agencies that misused the funds. 2. If the funds were indeed transferred for legitimate public use, the borrowers should be required to provide evidence, and the public funds and properties office should be responsible for clarifying and returning the funds. 3. In cases where the misuse and embezzlement of grain funds are verified, the county government will propose and secure the submission of the funds by the involved households. 4. If the embezzlers and misusers are not in the county, the county government should investigate their addresses, report to the department, and publish a warning in the newspaper, setting a deadline for pursuing compensation.</p>
<p>(2) For the twenty-two counties where the amount of grain funds embezzled or misused has been identified, but the names of the embezzlers and the agencies that misused the funds have not yet been accurately determined, including Xinghua, Huaiyin, Jiangyin, Taicang, Jintan, Songjiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Yixing, Jingjiang, Funing, Lianshui, Dongtai, Baoying, Shuyang, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Liuhe, Wuxian, Nantong, Rugao, and Jiangpu, the reorganization measures are to have the county thoroughly investigate and report the details. If necessary, the department will send commissioners for a re-investigation.</p>
<p>(3) For the twelve counties that have not misused or embezzled grain reserve funds, including Wujiang, Baoshan, Jiading, Fengxian, Gaochun, Gaoyou, Changshu, Chongming, Qingpu, Lishui, and Jiangdu, Suining, the reorganization measure is to order the recovery of granaries and implement the purchase and storage of grain within a specified timeframe.</p>
<p>(4) For the five counties that have never had a grain reserve system or grain reserve funds, including Qidong, Yangzhou, Guanyun, Jiangning, and Fengxian, the reorganization measure is to order the county magistrate to develop a plan and report it.</p>
<p>(5) For the five counties where investigations have not yet been conducted due to the impact of military affairs, including Tongshan, Dangshan, Pixian, Donghai, and Ganyu, the reorganization measure is to have the county conduct a preliminary investigation and report the details.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Gazetteer Conference</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Gazetteer Compilation Committee held its sixth general meeting yesterday at the Provincial Land Bureau. Compilers Zhuang Sijian, Ye Chucang, Zhu Gongsan, Liu Yimou, Liu San, Chen Hanzhang, Jin Shi, and sub-compilers Shen Mianhou, Zhu Fogong, Qin Xiaolu, Yao Zirang, Wu Tongju, Zhu Xiaogu, Shan Dongsheng, Yao Yuanchu, and others, a total of twenty-nine people, attended.

Zhu Xiaogu's "Transportation" was more than halfway completed, and others had also made contributions. It is estimated that the first draft can be completed as scheduled by the end of this year. In the afternoon, various group meetings were held, followed by a general meeting to discuss all ongoing matters. After the meeting, Provincial Governor Ye Chucang and Land Bureau Director Zhu Gongsan hosted a banquet, and everyone enjoyed themselves.</p>
<h3>Recent Bandit Situation in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Zhang Huizan Resigns as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province has the most bandits, the most severe devastation, the widest bandit areas, and the largest number of disaster victims among the southeastern provinces. Before the suppression army was formed, the 18th, 12th, Newly Compiled 13th Divisions, and the 148th Brigade were deployed in various locations to suppress bandits. However, they were merely chasing them from one place to another. After Zhang Guijun's troops fled to Hunan, the divisions of Zhang Huizan, Tan Daoyuan, and Deng Ying also joined the battle sequence. Currently, the Deng and Zhang Divisions have moved from western and northern Jiangxi to the Hunan border, and Cheng Guangyao's Brigade has also entered Hunan from Hankou. Jin Handing's Division has moved from Ganzhou with four regiments to Ji'an and will also move from Pingxiang to the Hunan border. Therefore, the defense of this province feels increasingly weak. According to recent reports, in the southern Jiangxi area, the remnants of Zhu Mao's forces, such as Li Duanjiu and Duan Yuequan, are again looting and burning everywhere in Yudu, Xingguo, Xinfeng, Xunwu, and other counties, creating a state of anarchy. The Jiangxi Telecommunications Administration has closed the telegraph bureaus in more than ten counties in southern Jiangxi because the equipment and wires of the telegraph bureaus were destroyed by the Communist bandits and are difficult to restore, in order to avoid further losses. In the western Jiangxi area, Ninggang and Yongxin have been occupied by bandits for nearly a year, and the county government of Anfu and other counties have also retreated to Ji'an. The red flames are raging, and able-bodied men are being forced into the Red Guards by the Communist Party, resulting in countless deaths. In the northern Jiangxi area, Xiushui and Wanzai were once captured by Peng's bandits. Although they have been recovered, the spread of scattered bandits is still increasing. In the eastern Jiangxi area, Communist leader Fang Zhimin is burning, killing, and looting in Dexing, Yiyang, and other areas, devastating more than ten counties. The town of Hekou in Qianshan, a major town in eastern Jiangxi with a population of over 100,000, was attacked and captured again on the 6th because the 52nd Brigade had left its defense. The military and political authorities received a telegram from the Qianshan County Magistrate yesterday, requesting the urgent dispatch of troops to suppress and eliminate the chaos. After receiving the telegram, Lu Dipin immediately ordered the police regiment of Zeng Zhenxiang to advance for suppression, and also urgently ordered the security first and second teams to return to the province and head to eastern Jiangxi to fill the defense gap.</p>
<p>Zhang Huizan, the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the province, has requested Chairman Lu to forward to the central government his resignation from the bandit suppression position because his troops have departed to suppress the rebel army and he cannot take care of bandit suppression. His resignation stated that the accumulated problems cannot be solved in a short time, and the people hanging upside down have not been relieved. The rebel army is attacking in full force to support the bandits, and his troops have successively departed, so he is only sitting in name. He requests that the position of commander-in-chief of bandit suppression be removed so that he can focus on suppressing the rebels. Once the rebels are destroyed, the bandit forces will naturally collapse. Lu has already telegraphed to Beijing to request instructions. (13th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Decline of Commerce in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi is located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, with convenient transportation, and commerce has always been developed. Jiujiang is the gateway to Jiangxi Province, with steamships and trains connecting in all directions. Therefore, the province's imported goods are concentrated here. Major imports include cotton yarn, textiles, foreign goods, hardware, and seafood. Major exports include rice, porcelain, paper, bamboo, wood, summer cloth, and so on. Since last year, the business of each of the above has gradually declined, and now it is less than four or five tenths of what it used to be. Tax revenue has certainly decreased and is insufficient to meet the quota, and the business of the Nanxun Road and small export steamers has also collapsed. This is unprecedented. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (A) More than sixty of the province's eighty-one counties have been harassed by the Communist bandits, resulting in countless deaths and displacement. In southern and western Jiangxi, most of the fields are uncultivated, and the amount of production has dropped drastically. The Gan River is over 1,800 miles long and is the transportation hub of the province. Currently, the people on both sides of the Ji-Gan area have mostly become bandits, navigation is cut off, and transportation is blocked. All goods cannot circulate, and the goods of Nanchang and Jiujiang cannot be transported to various places, just as the goods of various places cannot be exported. With goods not circulating, finance is naturally difficult to activate, and the shortage of money is unprecedented. (B) Since last summer, the province has been plagued by drought and locusts. The average harvest in various places is less than four or five tenths. After entering the spring of this year, all counties are experiencing severe rice shortages. Areas that used to produce rice are now purchasing foreign rice from Shanghai to help the general public have enough to eat. It is difficult for them to even fill their stomachs, so how can they have money to buy goods? Therefore, the purchasing power and consumption of society have greatly declined. The Nanchang market has recently become increasingly depressed. Wholesale outside the county is not happening at all, and retail is also very cold. Since the abolition of the lunar new year tax to the present, more than forty merchants have closed down, including Yongtaichang, Yishengyuan, and others. Currently, the money market is extremely tight, with monthly interest rates reaching more than four percent. Five or six money shops have also been stranded, including Daji. All industries are shrinking and struggling to survive. This phenomenon is unprecedented. (15th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the South Manchuria Railway Restructuring Plan</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway authorities have been holding meetings since last month to vigorously plan reform and management strategies. The reform of the official system has now been decided and the director of the business department of the bureau has been ordered to take the plan to Tokyo to ask the Ministry of Colonial Affairs for approval. It is reported that after the Ministry of Colonial Affairs received the case, it immediately ordered the Colonial Industry Bureau to review it. There were no major changes to the original plan, and it has been approved. The main points of the amendment are to clarify the responsibilities of the directors and ministers to rationalize the affairs, that is, to reform the previous four-part system of the president's office, the management industry, the local railway, and the four departments, and to newly establish twelve departments, including general affairs planning, negotiation management, railway local colonization, construction, coal mines, iron production, material sales, etc., which are further divided into forty-nine sections. Among them, the noteworthy ones are the newly established negotiation department to correct the past ills of double diplomacy. In addition, the General Affairs Department has added a labor affairs section to investigate and study labor issues, and the Planning Department is studying the future development of the South Manchuria Railway, which is worthy of attention. The following is a record of the key points of the amendment: (A) Amendment Purpose: To give full play to the functions of the company and to simplify and expedite affairs. (B) Amendment Points: (1) According to the current official system, the division of responsibilities and scope of responsibilities between the vice president and the director is not clear enough. However, the new official system makes the vice president and the director the ministers of each department, so that the division of responsibilities is completely consistent with the purpose of the terms. (2) According to the current official system, the review mechanism for business plans is not sufficient. However, in the new official system, the newly established Planning Department is used as the review mechanism for business plans. (3) According to the current official system, because administrative and profit-making affairs are governed by the same department, it is often difficult to determine the management policy. However, in the new official system, the current industrial department is divided into colonization and sales departments to give full play to its functions. (4) According to the current official system, the various departments in charge of civil engineering and construction work have long lacked contact and control. However, in the new official system, the construction department (work department) is independent. In addition to improving and preserving the line work, all civil engineering and construction matters within the company are uniformly managed. (5) Regarding the sale of products manufactured by the company and the purchase of goods for company use, in view of the importance of the matter, each is an independent department and is promoted.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Provincial Touring Lecture Team Visits Songjiang: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Department Touring Lecture Team arrived in Songjiang at 1:00 PM yesterday (18th) by boat from Zhujing.

<p>Family Members of Criminals Accuse the Third Prison Warden: Since the Jiangsu Third Branch Prison in Siqian Street transferred thirty prisoners, including Chen Yiyi, Lu Jinren, and Xue Hao, to the Army Prison the day before yesterday, the Army Prison Warden ordered Chen Yiyi, Lu Jinren, Xue Hao, and others to shave their heads and be put in shackles, regardless of their status. However, the family members of Chen and others stated that Chen Yiyi and others were not inciting prison riots, but that the newly appointed Third Branch Prison Warden, Ding Lei, falsely reported to the High Court, resulting in their transfer to the Army Prison to suffer. Therefore, they jointly accused the new Prison Warden Ding of this yesterday and requested the Ministry of Justice to investigate.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Loot Beizha Town: Beizha Town in Wujiang County is the richest town in Wujiang, more than ten miles away from Pingwang. There are water and land police teams and security groups responsible for defense. Yesterday (18th) at about 5:00 AM, a large group of lake bandits suddenly landed and set up sentries, then surrounded the police teams and security groups and took all their weapons. They also cut off the long-distance telephone lines to the Yangtze River. Then, under the command of the bandit leader, the bandits looted and searched for three hours, and no shops or residents in the town were spared. At about 8:00 AM, they loaded their loot onto the boats and sailed towards Taihu Lake. Afterwards, the Ninth District Chief of the town, Miao Tianzhi, urgently telegraphed the Wujiang County Government and the Third District of the Suzhou Water Police, requesting them to quickly send teams to pursue and suppress the bandits. After receiving the telegram, District Chief Gong immediately telegraphed the Fifteenth Team Captain Lu Shangzhong to suppress the bandits, and also telegraphed the guerrillas to send boats to assist in the pursuit.</p>

<p>Negotiations Arise Over a Fire Causing Injury: At around 11:00 PM on the evening of the 16th, a fire broke out at the Chen family's workshop in the Sanyuan Kang Silk Factory in Sanlong Lane outside Wuqiao, north of the city, burning down the homes of Guo Genhe and four others, and burning to death five female workers, including the foreman Qiaoxian. It is reported that on the evening of the incident, when the foreign dragon of the 11th Section of the North District Security Fire Brigade passed through the South embankment of Wuqiao, it was suddenly collided with by the machine dragon of the 12th Section of the North District Tong'an Fire Brigade, pressing the dragon body on the members of the Security Fire Brigade, Wan Jinhu and Hu Shujin, who died instantly. They were rescued and woke up. Members of the Tong'an Fire Brigade, Meng Panhai and Liu A'er, saw that the accident had happened and contacted Fan Chenglan, a member of the Security Fire Brigade, agreeing to be responsible for medical expenses and then dispersed. Unexpectedly, the next day, Tong'an suddenly regretted their previous statement and reported to the Firefighting Federation, fabricating a story that the Security Fire Brigade was provoking and beating members and requesting relief. After hearing about it, the Security Fire Brigade also reported the incident to the Firefighting Federation. The Firefighting Federation then sent Wang Shaoquan, the director of the investigation section, to investigate. The investigation found that members Wan and Hu were indeed injured by the Tong'an machine dragon, and there was no evidence of the Security Fire Brigade provoking. The findings of the investigation were reported to the Federation for approval. Currently, the injuries of the Security Fire Brigade members are quite serious and they have asked famous trauma specialists such as Shi Yunhua to treat them, and their lives are likely out of danger. It is also reported that on the evening of the incident, conflicts also occurred in certain sections of the North District and are currently under negotiation.</p>

The criminals Lü and Hang confessed, and Lü confessed that he shot and injured Song Shaolun, the guard in front of Miao's residence, on May 26. The criminal Deng has been uncooperative from the beginning, insisting that his surname is Jiang and not Deng. Although Hang and Lü identified him as Deng, he still refused to admit it. Director Huang immediately transferred 1,000 prisoners to the County Government for interrogation yesterday afternoon. It is also reported that the bandits' headquarters is on a boat, with titles such as staff officer and secretary. There are six bandit leaders, and the bandit ship is docked in one place under the Chang'an Bridge outside the North Gate, one place behind the back door of the Buyu Teahouse outside the West Gate, and one place in Lixiandun. It is estimated that the shopkeeper Huang Zixin and others can be released on bail pending verification.

It was reported yesterday that the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, in order to reward the police officer, specifically instructed the First Branch Bureau to promote Song Shaolun to the position of patrol chief for future promotion when there is a vacancy.</p>
<p>Bandits Set Fire to Three Homes in a Row: At about 1:00 AM yesterday (18th), four or five bandits dressed in short blue and white cloth shirts and trousers, armed with wooden sticks, iron rulers, and flashlights, broke into the home of Yuan Quanfu, a resident of Jiuliji Village, Yangming Township (Third District) in the county, and searched at will. Because Yuan's family did not have much property, the bandits were unable to satisfy their greed and set fire to the house in anger. They then broke into Yuan Gengquan's house and robbed a bag of cocoon shells worth more than ten yuan. Finally, they broke into Yuan Baoquan's house and robbed a leather suitcase before fleeing. Afterwards, the Third Branch Bureau of the South District Public Security Bureau learned of the situation and Director Zhu Niansheng led the police to arrest the bandits. When they arrived behind Zhangyuan Nunnery, they encountered the bandit Yu Sanbao carrying a bag of cocoon shells on his shoulder, looking panicked. Director Zhu captured him and brought him to the bureau for interrogation. Unexpectedly, when they were escorting him to the Rihui Bridge in Nanli, the bandit Yu Sanbao jumped into the river to escape.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Rectification of Grain Reserve Special Funds by the Civil Affairs Department. The Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department considers grain reserves for disaster preparedness as an essential element of people's livelihoods. Regarding the special funds for grain reserves in various counties, some have been misappropriated, some have been embezzled with the details yet to be investigated, while others have not been misappropriated, or some counties have never had grain reserves at all. As the circumstances vary across counties, they should be investigated separately to facilitate recovery of funds. Therefore, yesterday, instructions were issued to various counties, including Shanghai, Nanhui, Jinshan, Chuansha, Haimen, Kunshan, and Zhenjiang, and personnel were dispatched to investigate the extent of misappropriation and embezzlement, with a deadline for repayment to deter future occurrences. It is reported that a total of twenty-three counties have misappropriated these funds, twelve counties have embezzled them, and five counties have no grain reserve system or grain reserve fund. There are also five counties where thorough investigations have not been conducted due to the impact of military affairs. It is believed that this rectification will greatly benefit disaster relief policies.</p>

Enrollment has already begun, and the school is scheduled to open on the 23rd. The school is located at Louxiang Elementary School in the city. The purpose of the school is to assist the general public who have missed out on education. Anyone between the ages of twelve and fifty can enroll, and classes will be held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, which will not interfere with daytime work. The Provincial-Municipal Boundary Delimitation Conference. The issue of delimiting the boundary between Jiangsu Province and the City of Nanjing has been unresolved for a long time.

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Request to Levy Livestock Donation and Toll Fees for Expenses. As township and town public offices lack special funds to cover expenses, the district public office has successively requested the county to deduct funds from local donations for support. Now, the Second and Fifth Districts have again petitioned the county: (1) District Chief of the Second District, Zang Liuqi, submitted a request from the Xiaguan Town Public Office to collect donations on livestock crossing the border, similar to the Guazhen Lifesaving Bureau's practice, at a rate of eight cents per head of cattle and five cents per head of pigs and sheep. Thirty percent of the donations would subsidize the district public office, thirty percent would fund construction projects, and forty percent would cover the expenses of the town public office. The request was denied with the justification that the donation might hinder the lifesaving bureau's operations and was therefore deemed inappropriate. (2) District Chief of the Fifth District, Zhang Zhaoxiang, submitted a request from the Yangqiao Township Head to continue collecting wheel and wharf toll fees at Gaogang (note: toll fees were previously collected at this location for road construction, but the fees did not cease after the road was completed) to supplement the public office's expenses. The request was rejected, and it was advised to negotiate with the wheel company at the location and report back for review.</p>
<p>Reduction of Slaughter Tax Still Lacks Commercial Management. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Management Office reduced the slaughter tax in Jiangdu by five percent, setting the minimum amount at 32,414 yuan. The committee invited merchants to bid, but still no one expressed interest. The assigned committee member, Gu Yunpeng, has jointly petitioned the Provincial Office with County Head Chen, citing the desolate state of the slaughtering business in Jiangdu, the lack of recovery, and the current off-season, which discourages merchants from contracting.</p>
<p>Eight Robbers Raid Tax Office. The Shaobo Zhaoguan Tax Office in Jiangdu County was raided on the night of the 15th by eight individuals wearing gray short coats, armed with guns.

<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Arrest of the Director of the Fengjing Branch Bureau for Illegal Acts.

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Petition for Investigation of the Director of the Bureau of Education. Ren Xuan, the Director of the Jiaxing County Bureau of Education, has been greatly derelict in his handling of educational matters and has not made the bureau's finances public. The expenses for the summer school, which the bureau organized last year, have not yet been announced. Recently, the director has also been accused of insulting women, leading to much public criticism. It is reported that the County Women's Association and the Xincong District Teachers' Union have listed various charges and submitted them to the County Government, requesting a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Curbing Extortion in Land Tax Collection. The land scribes in the various villages of Jiaxing County often do not follow regulations when requesting landowners to push for land transfers, arbitrarily demanding fees, even to the extent of three or four cents, or five or six cents, per mu (unit of land), and in some cases, up to one or two yuan. If their demands are not met, they refuse to accept the payment or delay the process. Most landowners are unaware of the regulations and, due to property rights concerns, often pay the demanded amount to avoid difficulties. This malpractice has been going on for a long time. After a report was made, the County Government issued a notice the other day, informing landowners that in the future, when requesting land transfers, whether for dry land, paddy fields, or tidal flats, they should only pay a handling fee of one dime per mu according to the regulations. For cases involving the transfer of ownership, the consolidation of two households, or the division of one household, the handling fee should only be two cents per mu. All land scribes have been instructed to comply.</p>
<p>Suspension of Deed Verification for Land Near the City. The city walls of Jiaxing from the South Gate to the East Gate have long been demolished, and the roads have been constructed. Now, the second phase of city wall demolition, from the Jiahe First Bridge east of the East Gate to the Lotus Dike north of the North Gate, is about to begin. The surveying has been completed, and the plan has been finalized. The County Government has ordered the Finance Bureau to investigate and suspend the verification of deeds for the civilian land within ten zhang (unit of measurement) of the city walls. If landowners insist on having their deeds verified, the date of verification must be stamped on the deed for record-keeping, to avoid future disputes.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Fundraising to Assist in Remitting Department Funds.

It is reported that the Bank of China has already allocated these funds to its central branch for remittance to the central government.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief and Exemption Methods. The Zhejiang Finance Department, based on a telegram from Shen Jinxiang, the County Head of Yueqing, requesting instructions on whether the disaster relief and exemption should only be applied to provincial funds, while the county continues to collect funds, decided yesterday that the silver and rice pre-allocated to each county for disaster relief should be used to offset the full amount of provincial and county surtaxes.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Principal and Others from Chunhui Middle School Kidnapped by Bandits. At around 7:00 PM on the 15th, as the private Chunhui Middle School in Yiting Baima Lake was about to put on a new play, more than ten bandits disguised themselves and hid weapons, sneaking into the school. Four bandits suddenly pulled out pistols, drove the staff into a room, locked it, and guarded the front and back doors, cutting off communication between the inside and outside. The remaining bandits simultaneously broke into the office, pointing guns at the chests of the two youngest students, forcing them to reveal the whereabouts of Principal Fan Shoukang and Jing Hengyi. The two students were terrified and unable to speak. At the time, Fan Shoukang was dining with the Director of General Affairs, Zhang Yuwen, who had not finished his meal. Jing Hengyi, the Chinese teacher Zhang Weiqi, the mathematics teacher Lin Zhiqi, the director of student affairs Jiang Yishi, the chemistry teacher Wu Minxing, and others were also present. Upon seeing the scene, Fan Shoukang questioned their actions and identified himself as the principal, ordering them not to harm the students. Upon hearing this, the bandits seized the opportunity to surround Fan. Seeing the situation worsen, Zhang Yuwen quickly jumped out of the window and escaped. By this time, the teachers had already fled for cover. The chemistry teacher, Wu Minxing, was unable to escape and was also kidnapped by the bandits and forced out of the school at gunpoint. The Sixth Regiment of the security team stationed at the Sangwang Temple, about three miles from the school, received the alarm and rushed to the Zhang'ao Shimenkou Xiaobanling area, but the bandits had already disappeared. Later, a body was found lying on the road. The team soldiers identified him as Yu Shifa, the former bodyguard of Regiment Commander Zhang Peihu. According to nearby residents, Yu had just finished gambling at a certain family's house and was returning to Commander Zhang's villa (located next to Chunhui School, near Chunshe). He happened to encounter the bandits kidnapping someone from the school and attempted to stop them. The bandits immediately shot him three times in the legs, arms, and chest, causing him to collapse and die. At the school, the students were caught off guard by this unexpected event, and the order was slightly disrupted, but it was quickly restored. After the incident, a headcount of the entire school was taken, and it was discovered that student Xia Naiwu was missing. Fan Shoukang graduated from the College of Liberal Arts of Tokyo Imperial University in Japan during the early years of the Republic of China. He served as an editor at the Shanghai Commercial Press, the principal of the Art University, a professor at Daxia University, and a professor at Guangdong Zhongshan University. He returned to Shangyu in 1926 to take over as the principal of Chunhui Middle School. His wife, Ms. Hu, was about to give birth and was heartbroken by the tragic scene. A telegram has been sent to Yingkou to urge his father-in-law, Fan Yunshu, to return south to assist in the rescue.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Dismembered Corpse Head Found on Wolong Mountain. Since the headless murder case occurred in Hanjiachi, the head has now been found on Wolong Mountain on the 17th. The deceased is identified as Zhang Yisheng's second son, Zhongyao, aged about twenty. The deceased had a head rash and was known for not engaging in legitimate work, but rather indulging in licentious activities. He had been missing for five or six days, causing his mother great anxiety. She sent people to identify the body, but without the head, they could not confirm the identity. On the 17th, family members found a cloth bag in a broken grave on Wolong Mountain. Upon opening it, they confirmed that it was Zhang Zhongyao's head, as well as his leather shoes and woolen hat. People have also reported that the well water behind the Zhihe indigo shop nearby had turned red a few days ago, and a blood-stained garment was retrieved. There are clues to the case, as the family of the deceased's wife also lived nearby, but they suddenly moved away and locked up the house. The Detective Team entered the house and found blood stains on the bed frame and other places, confirming that the crime scene was there. The items have been sealed for evidence, and the search for the murderer is underway.</p>
<p>Petition to Postpone Street Demolition Denied. The Bureau of Construction has stipulated that all buildings along the main street in Shaoxing must be demolished by the end of June. Representatives elected by the merchants petitioned the County Government to postpone the demolition but were denied. As a result, they will convene another meeting to decide on the phased demolition and the allocation of demolition costs.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Two Ocean Pirates Executed by Firing Squad. Pirates Zheng Xingzhang, a native of Wenling, and Xu Guibang, a native of Linhai, along with their gang members, repeatedly plundered merchant ships and kidnapped people for ransom in the outer seas. They were captured by the Outer Sea Water Police Bureau and reported to the Provincial Government, which ordered the Fourth District Bandit Suppression Command to handle the matter. After investigation and interrogation by the Military Law Office of the Command, they were found guilty and sentenced to death. Yesterday at noon, the Command brought the two convicts, Zheng Xingzhang and Xu Guibang, to the Jiangbei Ancaoma Road execution ground to verify their identities and execute them by firing squad.</p>
<p>Small Steamer Shot at in Fog. The Dingxing steamer, recently purchased from Jardine Matheson in Shanghai by Tao and others from Dinghai, obtained a shipping license from the Jianghai Customs and planned to operate a small freight and passenger service between Zhoushan and Shenjiamen. On the 11th, it departed from Shanghai for Ningbo, intending to register with the Zhejiang Customs. On the afternoon of the 12th, while traveling through the Wushan waters, the captain saw a slight fog and dropped anchor. After the fog cleared, he wanted to continue sailing, but the machinery suddenly malfunctioned and could not travel far. Hearing that there were many pirates in the waters and seeing dozens of refrigerated boats anchored together in the distance, he went to join them. Unexpectedly, two merchant ships in the group mistook the steamer for a pirate vessel and opened fire. The next morning, soldiers boarded the steamer to investigate, realizing the misunderstanding. The steamer sustained numerous bullet holes, and Liu Changsheng, the cook, Chen Aden, the ship's cook, and Ke A Wang, a friend of the shipowner, were all shot. After arriving in Ningbo, the steamer reported the incident and the ordeal to the Zhejiang Customs. The injured, including Liu Changsheng, were taken to Guanghua Hospital for treatment. The steamer plans to sail to Zhoushan for minor repairs to the bullet holes before commencing operations. The Shanghai Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association has been requested to write to the Outer Sea Water Police Bureau for a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Actor A: Because you are best at doing god and monster plays. Playing immortals. Playing bodhisattvas. Just like the real thing. So after you die, you can definitely go to heaven.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Daxia Harmonica Concert [by] Juemin</h3>
<p>At 8:00 PM on the 7th, the Harmonica Band of Daxia University in this city held its first "Harmonica Concert" at the auditorium of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. I have long admired the band's reputation and eagerly wanted to listen to their wonderful music. So I made an appointment with a friend to go. When we arrived at the venue, there were already about 400 guests. Not long after, Chairman Mr. Wang Zhiwei gave an opening speech. He briefly said, "The harmonica, which is called 'Harmonica' in English, is a newly emerging musical instrument in modern times. Its tone is clear and elegant, not unlike the sheng and reed instruments. And it is light and simple, rarely has any match. It is indeed a necessary entertainment item for the masses. Therefore, Europe, America and Japan are all actively promoting it. The holding of harmonica concerts is also extremely popular. But in our country, tonight is still the first time ever. The Daxia Harmonica Band was organized by the harmonica master Mr. Wang Qingxun. It has been established for four years. It has performed many times inside and outside the school, and has been greatly welcomed and praised by the audience. But because it was just established, we still don't dare to be confident in everything. I also hope that you will give me some advice." Immediately after, the performance began. The first part of the first section was the band's ensemble overture "The Fall of Baghdad". It was conducted by Mr. Wang himself. The music was sonorous and the interest was long-lasting. Next, Ms. Hu Zhoushu'an sang two solo songs, "Dove in the Forest" and "Optimism" composed by Hu Shi. Both were excellent. The second was the harmonica ensemble "Happy Coppersmith" march. It was quite fun. (4) was a piano solo by Ms. Li Guoqi, which was also good. (5) Harmonica duet "Heaven and Hell" by Mr. Wang Qingxun and Mr. Liu Yin (6) Harmonica ensemble, jazz song "Amusement Band" and "Oriental Dance." After the performance, there was a ten-minute break before playing again.</p>
<p>The second part began with a harmonica ensemble, waltz "Danube Water". Next, Mr. Li Enke sang a solo "Widow's Heart" and "Spanish Dance" which made people feel relaxed. The next harmonica duet was "Longing for Each Other" by Mr. Wang Qingxun and Mr. Lin Jiaxiang. Then Mr. Wang Qingxun's harmonica solo was his own song from the opera "Carmen." The audience was especially captivated by the melodious and gentle music. "Serenade" was also played, which was extremely beautiful and soft</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Mr. Chen Yingshi's Childhood [by] Boying</h3>
<p>In the winter of the tenth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, one day, there were eight or nine children from Haidao, Huzhou, playing there. Haidao is in the city, not a real island in the sea, but a wide open space. After playing for a while, the wind was strong and the grass was dry. A child suddenly had a strange idea. He found a source of fire and lit the dry grass against the wind. In an instant, the wind fanned the fire, and the fire rode the wind. The children jumped around on the grassland. The fire also chased the children around. The flames soared and swirled, and it was very intense for a while. The children were very happy. Suddenly, a child fell to the ground. The fire immediately rushed towards him, and his clothes were all on fire. The children were horrified and ran away in a frenzy. The child who was on fire wanted to shout for help, but his mouth was like being clamped. Just when he was in danger, another child rushed into the fire and pounced on the child. He hugged him and rolled him out. After leaving the fire, they got up and fortunately were not injured. Who was this child who rushed into the fire to help? It was Mr. Chen Yingshi, whom we admire today. He was only eight years old at the time. As the saying goes, even a small bamboo has the ambition to soar into the sky. It is indeed not an exaggeration. [Said] friend Zhang Dezhai.</p>
<p>After the performance, I asked about the organization of the band, and Mr. Wang answered as follows. "Our band is now divided into eight parts. (1) First soprano harmonica (2) Second soprano harmonica (3) First alto harmonica (4) Second alto harmonica (5) Bass harmonica (6) Lowest bass harmonica (7) Chord harmonica and (8) Percussion instruments (such as tambourine, cymbals, triangle iron, etc.) The organization is slightly modeled after orchestral music. It costs very little and is easy to practice."</p>
<p>I heard that Mr. Wang has recently compiled a book called "The Latest Harmonica Playing Method". In addition to explaining various musical theories and playing methods, the book includes photos of famous harmonica bands from around the world and 100 famous Chinese and foreign songs. It also has prefaces and inscriptions by Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shi, and Feng Zikai. It has now been printed and will be published soon. Mr. Wang also recognized the lack of excellent harmonicas in China, and specially commissioned several types of harmonicas from the German Hohner company, named "Truth, Goodness, and Beauty". All of them are equipped with low "la" sounds, etc. It is said that they will arrive in Shanghai and be sold at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is enthusiastic about promoting the harmonica. He is currently serving as the harmonica band instructor in major universities and middle schools, and the results are very good.</p>
<h3>What I Know of Mr. Cheng (Part 2) [by] Shen Zhuoran</h3>
<p>Mr. Cheng loved wine. Every evening, he would go to a small shop to drink. However, he did not drink excessively and never collapsed like Jade Mountain. I occasionally drank with him. When he was slightly drunk, he would recite his own works, both poetry and lyrics, which were excellent. He said that in his later years, he only cared about wine and no longer thought of being a poet. He just wanted to follow the example of the Gaoyang drunkard. I joked, "Then after you turn 100, I will erect a stone tablet to commend you and inscribe the six characters 'Grave of the Drunkard Cheng Nuzhi'. What do you think?" Mr. Cheng smiled and nodded, thinking that I deeply understood his meaning. He also said, "One day, when I leave this world, will you have the same feeling as passing by the old Huang Gong wine furnace again?" I said, "The flute of Shanyang, the pain of human and musical instruments, the sadness and desolation, how can I not be moved?" Unfortunately, the prophecy came true. Now, I really can't bear to pass by this shop often.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng was willing to associate with anyone. And the strangest thing was that he often treated butchers, wine merchants, and vendors as friends. They were very happy when they met. He said that these people were simple and honest and did not deceive. Although they were vulgar, it did not matter. Even if they were not reclusive heroes, they were still much better than those who were fickle and turned against each other as if they did not know each other.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng liked to watch Peking Opera. He always went to a certain stage. Even if it was the same play, he did not mind watching it three or four times. At that time, there was a certain female actor whose beauty and art were outstanding, but her name was not well-known. Mr. Cheng especially appreciated her, but the stage owner did not pay much attention to her. So he said to me, "We people in the world often meet with misfortune. Why not be like this actor?" He was saying this because he had feelings about something.</p>
<p>I met Mr. Cheng in the spring of Dingmao. I worked with him in the autumn of the same year. We often talked and got along very well. From then on, we became closer and became friends despite the age gap. And Mr. Cheng often told me about his life and experiences after tea and wine, so I was able to know the general outline of his life. I wrote it down in a messy way to show that Mr. Cheng's actions were different from the common people and to prevent him from being forgotten immediately. I also wrote a poem to express my condolences.</p>
<p>He was loyal and diligent in his old age, and his learning was profound.</p>
<p>He left behind a career of books, but who knows the name of the drunkard?</p>
<p>We gathered like duckweed for three years, and the spirit disappeared overnight.</p>
<p>Gazing at the coffin, I shed tears and sang a mournful song.</p>
<p>I cried again for Mr. Cheng in four quatrains.</p>
<p>It is said that he fell from the building and was surprised and suspicious.</p>
<p>Why did he turn into ashes like this?</p>
<p>He had a deep understanding of his young friends in his life.</p>
<p>I want to imitate the Summoning of the Soul Chu Elegy.</p>
<p>The scattered writings are dusty on the desk.</p>
<p>How much red and yellow handwriting is new?</p>
<p>From now on, the old and mature will wither.</p>
<p>Who will take over the career of the blue sorghum?</p>
<p>The most heartbreaking thing is to die and leave.</p>
<p>I drank turbid wine for three years, almost the same amount.</p>
<p>The star of wine returned to the cycle one night.</p>
<p>Tearful eyes</p>
<h3>Travels in the South Seas (32) Spiritual Flower</h3>
<p>On the 28th, I lectured at the Young Women's Christian Association. I was invited by Ms. Chen Kejie, a female executive there. There are many Catholic and Christian-run churches, schools, and organizations here. One large church cost a million. It was built by the British. Back when Jesus died, his disciple Judas sold him for thirty pieces of silver. Now, people embellish the tombs of the dead, spending hundreds of thousands. How is this not like the Pharisees? Jesus was the son of a craftsman. He was a practitioner of popular democracy. Now, emperors and rich men merely embellish his form and call it genuine faith? Therefore, in China and abroad, there are many who call themselves "True Jesus Churches". There is one in Taiyuan. There is one in the South Seas. Wherever I go, Christian friends ask me to lecture. I speak of Jesus as a non-violent person. All my friends greatly approve. They say, "To use religion to kill is truly not the way of a Christian." However, whether Catholic or Christian, they all run schools. Why do Buddhists not have this wisdom? It is a pity.</p>
<p>On the 29th, Lu Weichang of the Central Jingwu Athletic Association invited me to lecture at their association. The chairman is a woman, the wife of lawyer Huang Zhaogui, named Wu Rongzhi. Lu has single-handedly created Jingwu for over twenty years. It has branches in over forty cities at home and abroad, with over four hundred thousand members. Last year, I lectured at the Guangzhou branch. The chairman, Mr. Xiong Changqing, agreed to introduce the entire Jingwu into the Kunhua Taiping movement. Now, Lu publicly declares this to everyone. He also explains the meaning of Jingwu, which is to strengthen the body and mind to overcome adversity, not to engage in violence. Furthermore, Tai Chi Chuan originates from the Tai Chi of the Book of Changes, just as my Kun Qian is based on the Tai hexagram. We are comrades creating Eastern culture. When Lu first started this association, he was continuing the legacy of his teacher, the strongman Huo Yuanjia, to wash away the shame of the "sick man of the East." At first, people did not understand and even slandered them as "boxer bandits." Now, Jingwu associations for men and women are everywhere. Music and arts flourish, and the schools they run have achieved much. And the women's Jingwu associations are particularly developed. I believe that life should have noble entertainment to harmonize the body and mind. Otherwise, it will become evil. There are too few artistic entertainment institutions here. The so-called clubs number over two hundred. Clubs are mostly places of pleasure for the rich, with opium, mahjong, or pipa girls (i.e., prostitutes or female performers). This consumes their spirit. Therefore, there is no manifestation of national self-governance. The nation, with over ninety percent of the population, is managed by others and cannot be revitalized, all because of the lack of physical education, art, and noble entertainment. This is true not only overseas but also in various places in the mainland. However, the need for noble entertainment is even greater in the South Seas. I sincerely hope it will be promoted.</p>
<p>Unable to see clearly. Why grieve over the departure of the immortals from Yujing? I should be laughed at by the gentleman for my foolishness. Today, I passed by Master Huang's cremation site. Unable to hold back tears, I write this new poem. (Editor's note: Master Huang was my foolish friend. Over the years, we worked together at the Greater East. I benefited greatly. His lifelong work of proofreading books was meticulous. I deeply admired him and privately called him "King of Proofreaders." Now, I suddenly hear of his tragic death. Thinking of the past, I am filled with tears.)</p>

<h3>European Travelogue (59) Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>French Autumn Salon (Salon of Automne) 1929</p>
<p>(2) A Brief History of the Autumn Salon</p>
<p>Official art is decadent art. It is art without value. This saying has become a mantra for modern people. Therefore, the French Spring Salon and the British Royal Academy of Arts receive no attention because they contain nothing good. In the past, the French Spring Salon exhibited only the works of the official academic school, lacking any modern spirit and filled with a dead, stale feeling. After Courbet's initial opposition and later the revolutionary movements of impressionist painters like Manet and Monet, its influence plummeted.</p>
<p>In December 1884, George Surat (1860-1991), Parl Signac (1863), and others, whose works were repeatedly rejected by the Spring Salon, founded the Independent Exhibition. It accepted all new creations as much as possible, and the works of Surat, Signac, and Cross were particularly noteworthy. This led to the emergence of Neo-Impressionism. It was merely a gathering of unknown young painters. However, strangely, comrades gradually increased, and a new French art movement was subtly sparked. At that time, Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist art had already reached a stage of development.</p>
<p>In summary, Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism are both forms of sensory realism. They advocate directly depicting the external appearance of nature as reflected in the visual sense, thus rejecting the concept of "inherent color." Impressionism places more emphasis on the ever-changing colors of light and air. Neo-Impressionism pays attention to decorative effects. Their methods rely solely on sensation and detailed analysis, which is perfectly in harmony with the scientific worldview of the time. However, by the end of the 19th century, that worldview gradually faltered, and a yearning for the inner essence of reality sprouted. Simultaneously, a tendency against Impressionism emerged in art. A generation of awakened writers embarked on the road of exploration. In 1903, the Autumn Salon was born. The comrades who gathered there were later known as the "Fauves" (wild beasts).</p>
<p>Many artists with very different views gathered in the basement of a small palace in the autumn of 1903, displaying their works. After a few weeks, established masters also joined in. At that time, Frantz Jourdain, who was regarded as a madman by the public, mustered his courage and created the Autumn Salon. Starting from a humble basement, the Autumn Salon held a conference in the Grand Palace every other year. After a few years, its influence gradually expanded, repeatedly exhibiting great new creations. It subtly became the source of French artistic thought, expanding and turning the artistic thought of the world. However, there was a reason that contributed to this great artistic movement.</p>
<p>The French art scene at the time was already somewhat tired of the dazzling colors of Impressionism. The gathering of this new group was a natural result. Matisse, Vlaminck, Van Dongen, and others joined. These people have now become figures in permanent art history. At that time, they were all unknown and unproductive painters, and were regarded as an impure group of wild beasts. They sparked the magic movement of the early 20th century in France, a great revolution that European artists of the past could not have imagined.</p>

<h3>Bullion Market Weakens and Recovers</h3>
<p>Morning Weakness as Silver Bar Demand Lengthens and Exchange Rates Decline</p>
<p>Rumors of Bank Shipping Spot Exports, Afternoon Strength</p>
<p>High Volatility, Gold Prices Initially Weakened and Ultimately Wavered Erraticly Yesterday. At the opening, the bullion market started weak but eventually saw some strength. The fluctuations were chaotic, rising and falling erratically, making it difficult to predict. In the morning session, there were seven taels with fluctuations hovering around 590 taels. The afternoon session saw a difference of six or seven taels. However, the market showed new peaks, briefly exceeding the 599 tael mark, with turbulent and uncontrollable volatility. The exchange rate appeared to ease, with the asking price lengthened by two levels. However, brokers' buying and selling was not active, mainly because the fluctuations were too large and there was no large-scale speculation. Brokers such as Fuchang, Hengxing, Yu Dafu, Fuxingyong, and others entered and exited quickly. The silver bar demand was long in the morning, and there were many sellers, leading to a weakening trend that quickly broke through the 590 tael mark. The exchange rate then strengthened, and Yu Dafu, Fuchang, and others competed to buy, because the silver bar demand was drying up, causing a jump of six or seven taels with a strong upward momentum. There was a slight setback at noon, but in the afternoon, Yu Dafu, Yu Wanxing, Shunli, and others all added to their positions, causing a shift in sentiment. Especially after rumors that a certain bank was shipping a large amount of spot goods overseas, the market took on a strong momentum and quickly exceeded the highest price of the morning by 99 taels. However, because it was Wednesday, the exchange rate was closed as usual. But the speed with which the gold price recovered was unexpected. The pound sterling had already increased by 1.25, the forward rate by 1.875, and the silver price increased by half a cent.</p>
<p>Morning Session Lags, the August Gold Price Opened at 596 Taels, Slightly Higher by Five Candareens, then Immediately Plunged. The gross trading volume was only 90 taels because all parties were selling and the exchange rate was also weakening. The next-month Japanese gold could be settled at 1 tael, 3 mace, 3 candareens, 3.75 fen. In August, the British gold was sold by the Nissho Bank at 1 shilling, 6 pence, 3.125 fen, followed by an increase of 2 taels and another shilling. The asking price was around 92 taels. Then, with the asking price lengthened by half a penny, the US dollar increased by 1 yuan, and the Japanese gold fell by more than 4 fen. Large accounts and Koreans sold August British gold at 6 pence, 3.75 fen. The next month's gold was sold by Mitsui to Huabi, also at 6 pence, 3.75 fen, resulting in a drop of 3 to 4 taels around 10:00. Finally, it settled at 88 taels and 6 candareens. Afterwards, Yu Dafu, Xingyong, Fuchang, and others successively bought in, and the exchange rate improved, and the bank intended to pursue further gains. It was estimated that the recent Japanese gold was bought by Mitsui at 1 tael, 2 mace, 3 candareens. Various banks also mutually traded August British gold at 6 pence, 2.5 fen. It was heard that HSBC also had an appetite. Therefore, the gold price suddenly turned upward, soaring by 6 to 7 taels at 11:00, reaching 95 taels, 3 to 4 candareens. Afterwards, small retail investors sold off, resulting in a slight setback of 2 taels, hovering between 93 and 94 taels. At noon, from 92 taels, 3 to 4 candareens to 2 taels, 6 candareens closed. The quoted price was changed to 664 taels, 2 candareens, which was a slight decrease of 4 fen for Japanese gold. In the morning, there was a suppression of over 70 taels; at noon, it was 71 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session Surge: The afternoon market opened at 93 taels, 5 candareens. Goods also opened at a high price. Then, it was reduced by 1 tael to 92 taels, 4 to 5 candareens. Fuchang, Yu Dafu, and others bravely advanced, and rumors that a certain bank was transporting cash for export led the market to view this as a bullish sign, soaring to 99 taels, 1 candareen at 4:00, resulting in the resumption of afternoon trading. At this time, many parties took advantage of this high price to sell off. Therefore, it seemed that there were more sellers, and it was estimated that about 1 tael was repaired, settling at 97 taels, 6 to 7 candareens. The industry's psychology remained high, and there was another call to increase by 1 tael, totaling 598 taels, 5 candareens at closing. Compared to the day before, it increased by 3 taels. The maximum price for the day was 99 taels, 1 candareen, and the minimum price was 88 taels, 6 candareens, a difference of 10 taels, 5 candareens. The quoted price was reduced by 65 to 66 taels. Before trading opened, the price was 91 taels to 93 taels. After trading opened, the price was 97 taels to 99 taels. The settlement water was 91 taels. The afternoon settlement water was 97 taels. Goods opened early at 95 taels, 8 candareens. The noon settlement was 93 and a half taels. The afternoon 3 taels, 5 settlement, and 9 and a half settlement.</p>
<p>Speculative Fever Fades: Trading volume for various houses included Taixing, Yiyu, Yuanyuyong, and Shunli, which all bought in. Yu Da, Fuchang, and Fuxingyong had uncertain inflows and outflows. Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Yuankangxiang, and Xiangyu all sold. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, and Zhifengyong sometimes bought and sometimes sold. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuren, Senchangyong, and Fuyu all bought in. Dadecheng, Yiyu, Yuanmaodakang all sold. The remaining houses had uncertain inflows and outflows. The Dalian gang sold 1,000 bars in the morning session and bought 1,100-1,200 bars. In the afternoon session, they bought over 800 bars and sold 400 bars. The Guang gang had inconsistent inflows and outflows, with a total of around 1,000 bars traded.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Reduced</h3>
<p>Internal Market Also Eases, Chinese Merchants Slightly Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC quoted exchange rate had already lengthened by two levels. The British gold increased by half a penny, totaling 1 shilling, 5 pence, 75 fen. The US dollar increased by 1 yuan, totaling 35 yuan, 87.5 fen. The Indian rupee increased by 2.75 yuan, totaling 995 yuan. The French franc increased by 25 yuan, totaling 915 yuan. The Japanese yen increased by 2.5 shield, totaling 89 shield, 25 fen. The German mark increased by 4.5 yuan, totaling 150 marks. The Singapore dollar decreased by 4 taels, 2 candareens, 5 fen, totaling 156 taels, 75 fen. The Japanese gold decreased by 4 fen, totaling 1 tael, 3 mace, 7 fen, 75 li. The Hong Kong dollar remained unchanged, totaling 85 taels. The internal bank almost eased due to the long trend of silver demand and exchange rate recovery, and the listed price was like lengthening half a penny for a shilling of light, while the U.S. dollar added on one yuan, and Japanese gold fell by four parts, meaning there was now a tighter difference between the gold price and the exchange rate. The closing price yesterday afternoon compared to the night before meant there was an increase of 1.875 for recent shilling prices and 1.25 for forward shilling prices, while there were increases in the American currency of 4.375 to 3.125 and falls in the Japanese currency of only 2.25. Only the change of 10 taels in the gold market, from tiredness to strength, makes people unable to understand, which makes people unable to estimate the differences in sentiment at the end. The trading volume was around 590 taels, and it went up to 99 taels between the afternoon and early evening. However, the exchange market shut down at noon, but Chinese merchants did participate some in the early morning: they bought, then the bank repurchased, weakening the market. Around 100,000 pounds were traded in British gold, around 70-80,000 of which by Chinese merchants. Banks that entered were Zhenjin, Shanghai and Maihang, and Mitsui and Korea sold. Banks mutually traded around 40-50,000 pounds and paired for $100,000 dollars and the volume of Japanese currency was several ten thousand with a few sold by the Mitsui and Korea. The Bank of Taiwan and China has also been selling, and the Bank of Japan has also been buying and selling. There has been little trade for British and American banks, seemingly weakening the market.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rates mutually went up and down by 1.875 and the Swap Rate remained at 0.0625. The June price was the same at 1 shilling, 6 pence, 125 and the August price was 1.785, and September 25 buying price as the interest was added by 0.0625. The midday closing price for the June and July offering prices was 1.875, and the August price was 25, the September price 3.125 and the buying price remained plus 0.0625.</p>
<p>The internal American exchange rates had a point spread of around 25, with a monthly swap of 125. The midday closing price for the June and July offering prices was 36.75 yuan, with an August price of 875 and September price of 37 yuan. Buying prices added on 125.</p>
<p>Eastern internal exchange rates went up and down by 1/2 a percentage point and Swap Rates in the early morning were 3.75, and the midday percentage was half. The early morning June price offer was 1 tael, 3 mace, 5 and 7/10 fen. July 4 and 625/1000 fen and August 4.25, September 3.75. The purchasing price had smaller limits but at closing, the prices had slightly adjusted - 1 tael, 3 mace, 3/10 fen. July: 3 and 25/100, August: 2 and 75/1000 fen and September 2 and 25/100 fen. Prices were not open in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Have Recovered</h3>
<p>According to the latest London market report, the large order has seen a turn - a short-term rise of 125, totaling 15 pence, 8125 (combined with British gold, 1 shilling, 6 pence, 6875). The forward rate also rose 1.875 to 15 pence, 625. There were slight Indian buying and American intentions, and the market situation was stable. There was also a report from New York that the American silver price had recovered by half a point to 3.4125. There were no changes between American and British. British currency conversion to American remained $4.858125 dollars and $49.50 for a single dollar in Japanese. The exchange rate for 1 English shilling to Shanghai dollars increased by 375 to 1 shilling, 6 pence, 375. There was no news of later telegrams.</p>
<h3>The Silver Bullion Market Is Stable</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, in the money market, there were no important events besides the usual transactions. The opening prices were mostly stable. However, the price of Jiangnan small silver fell sharply in the afternoon, returning to its original level. The amount of money transferred by the banks was not very large, but the amount of money taken out of the warehouse was slightly more than the previous day.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: The "Foreign Interest Rate" was 7 mace, 1 fen, 9 li, 5 hao in the morning and 7 mace, 1 fen, 9 li, 6 hao, 2 hu in the afternoon, which was the same as the morning price the previous day. However, the situation was very strong, and there was a fear that it would continue to rise. The current situation of "Silver Interest Rate" and the problems with the money supply have had no impact. Therefore, the silver interest rate was similar to the previous day. The morning price was 1 mace, 3 fen, and the afternoon price was 1 mace. The banks' listed price was reduced by 1 fen to 5 fen. Because there was a lot of settlement cost and no one wanted it, there was no market.</p>

<h3>Bond Prices Continued Their Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market in this port saw a slight opening for spot bonds, but the volume was still scarce, only 23,900 yuan. The futures market was as lively as before, with active trading. The morning session saw over 7 million in transactions, and the afternoon session saw over 6.1 million. The market supply exceeded demand, the market sentiment was weak, and bond prices continued to fall without any sign of recovery. However, the trend had slightly eased, and customs duties, demobilization, troop reduction, and other bonds fluctuated by only about 1 yuan, which was less than the previous day, such as demobilization, customs duties futures, and troop reduction July futures, which all fell by about 1 yuan. The others also fell by less than half a yuan. However, the spot and July futures for the 7-year bonds and the Good Aftermath Customs Duties have been falling sharply due to the lack of a market. The Good Aftermath futures were the only ones that held steady, rising in the morning and weakening in the afternoon, with little change from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Struggling to Break Free from the Slump</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Yarn Prices Drop, Japanese Merchants Dump Large Quantities</p>
<p>Slight Increase in Exchange Rates, Sellers Exert Pressure</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market weakened in the morning and stabilized at noon, with a trend that was somewhat loose. The main reason was that the drop in foreign cotton yarn prices was still fierce, causing uncertainty and unease. Japanese merchants in this port, seeing the decline in the Osaka cotton industry, were actively dumping large quantities. Exchange rates increased slightly, and sellers exerted pressure. However, manufacturers and some bulls remained very calm. Although foreign goods prices had fallen, the exchange rate still made them expensive. The situation in the cotton yarn market was still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Bidding: The after-hours market saw a slight stabilization. The opening bid in the morning saw the market environment decline and negative sentiment, with retailers selling off. Prices fell by 5, 6, or 7 cents. The situation tightened slightly in the afternoon, but there were no large sales. Only Ruida sold an additional 850 bales. There were no large inflows or outflows in either the morning or afternoon markets. Prices for each month rose by 1 or 2 cents, but third-grade yarn still fell by 2 yuan. The total transaction volume for the entire day was 16,750 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Bidding Closing Prices - Increase/Decrease - Inventory</p>
<p>May 15.3 Decrease 6 24,200</p>

<p>August 15.70 Increase 7 27,400</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Sales Are Still Not Bad: The current cotton yarn sales are still good. The total volume of cotton yarn purchased by various gangs for the entire day was 1,100 bales. Traders among them purchased 200 bales. Market conditions were flat. Among the customer gangs, Guangdong purchased the most, totaling 460 bales. In addition, Sichuan purchased 300 bales, the mainland purchased 85 bales, Niuzhuang purchased 25 bales, Hankou purchased 25 bales, Gaoyou purchased 55 bales, Changsha purchased 60 bales, and other gangs purchased 65 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Still in a Downtrend</h3>
<p>American Cotton Prices Fell Sharply, Slight Recovery, Foreign Exchange Rates Slight Increase</p>
<p>Japanese Side Sets Sales with Spot Sales Undermine Market Sentiment</p>
<p>The downward trend in the cotton market intensified again because American cotton prices fell sharply with a slight recovery, and foreign exchange rates saw a slight increase. The Japanese East Asia Cotton Company, seeing that American cotton was not good, took the spot sales of July and August for 7-8 million, Ruida with 5,300 load and market sentiment, especially within the market was loosened. Most psychological views were tired and short, however, there were purchases with the void of Hankou.</p>
<p>Hankou Bids, Ruida, Da Ji mass sale. The opening of the Hankou market was at an increased price with the small increased price of cotton, but there was mass selling in the market, especially 3000 load from Da Ji and 5300 load from Ruida. Market prices were lower due to those two large sellers, falling by 25.5-26 and 3-4/100 of a cent. In the afternoon, Gongtai Jifeng, Changfeng, Yuanda and others sold 1000. 1800 and up to 2,500 load, but the rest were very cautious. Shenchang, Hankou, went in alone at 3,100 load and Tongxing, Fuhe, Maoji, Deji went in with a combined total of 1,000, 1,200 to 2,400. Each month saw an increase of 5-2/100 of a cent. The total volume of transactions for the entire day was 57,400 load. The closing price from the bidding with Hankou is recorded.</p>

<h3>Foreign Yarn: More Decreases Than Increases</h3>
<p>American cotton saw a slight rebound. Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to favorable Liverpool news and reactive buying, but then weakened due to some long positions closing. Futures rose two to eight points, and spot prices rose ten points. English cotton futures fell one to three points, and spot prices fell eleven points. The Indian cotton market was sluggish, with no change in prices for any brands. Original telegram recorded on the 17th.</p>

<h3>Grain: "Foreign Rice" Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time</h3>
<p>5,000 Bags Available, Large Grains Can Substitute for Japonica Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, both the local and inland rice dealers showed great interest in "foreign rice," with speculators also engaging in excessive buying, causing prices to rise by two to three cents. In the afternoon, customer demand slightly decreased, and sellers became more determined, with prices continuing to rise by over two cents. However, as prices increased, speculators rushed to sell for profit, causing prices to suddenly drop by a cent. In the end, the overall market was three cents higher than the previous day's market. Total market transactions exceeded 20,000 units, with actual sales accounting for about half, small lots accounting for about one-third, and large lots accounting for approximately 5,000 each. The "foreign rice" is arriving in Shanghai for the first time, with large grains that can substitute for japonica rice, priced at 16.70 to 17.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Resurgence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, flour futures rose due to recent inquiries from northern merchants about spot flour, which instantly improved sentiment. Mill releases also stopped, and new buying resumed, causing market prices to gradually rise. Furthermore, the new standard sampling of spot goods has also been announced by the mills to be implemented in two or three days, causing the market to turn around again. As a result, July rose 2.25 cents, August rose 1 cent, September rose 1.5 cents, October and November each rose 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rebound Four to Five Cents to Cover Short Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat prices rose across all months, with short sellers rushing to cover their positions. New buyers took advantage of the mills' competition to handle futures wheat and aggressively bought, causing the market to see a sharp rise that could not be broken. At closing, June and July each rose five cents, August, September, and November each rose four cents. Although a large amount of spot wheat arrived, mill demand was good, and market prices improved. Only the inter-port goods were slightly weak, with 2,500 bags of old car wheat selling for 5.4 taels. New wheat sold for 5.08 to 5.5 taels, medium quality wheat sold for 4.89 taels, and lower quality wheat sold for 4.56 taels.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Seeds Are Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, Hunan lotus seeds have become increasingly scarce, causing market prices to rise steadily, which is also reflected in the prices in Hankou. Top-grade lotus seeds have risen to 18.5 taels, mid-grade to 16.5 taels, and lower-grade to 13-14 taels. The sales of Guangdong merchants here are still active, with purchases being made every day. Yesterday, even the lower-grade goods sold for 25 taels. Market inventory is low, totaling no more than 3,000 boxes. The inventory of top-grade goods is even scarcer. Therefore, Hunan lotus seeds require 31 taels, Raozhou and Hengzhou goods require 29 taels, Jiuxi lotus seeds require 27-28 taels, Changde lotus seeds require 25 taels, and white lotus seeds require 33 taels.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Galvanized Iron, and Corrugated Iron Sheets are All Increasing in Price</h3>
<p>Since the exchange rate has frequently decreased, hardware sales have been trending upward. English and American galvanized iron and corrugated iron sheets are experiencing shortages, and transactions with various construction groups are very active. Therefore, market prices have risen sharply. Based on the import and export situation in various aspects, it is predicted that there is a high probability of continued price increases with no decreases. Recent estimated prices are recorded below (unit: taels):</p>
<p>Product Type English Galvanized Iron American Galvanized Iron Corrugated Iron Sheet</p>
<p>22 gauge 13.00 14.75 12.50</p>
<p>24 gauge 13.00 14.65 12.50</p>
<p>26 gauge 13.90 17.00 13.50</p>
<p>28 gauge 14.85 18.25 14.00</p>
<p>31 gauge 17.50 19.50</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Brown Sugar Suddenly Drops One Cent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports indicated that the price of spot Cuban sugar was 1.50, down 0.0625 compared to the previous report. New York sugar futures for September were 1.39 and for December were 1.48, each down three cents. The price for March of next year was 1.58 and for May was 1.65, each down two cents. The price of spot Javanese sugar was 9.125, futures for July were 8.875, and for August were 8.75, each down 0.125. The market for raw brown sugar, excluding white, announced declines, market sentiment weakened, shipments increased, and buying was quiet. As a result, the transaction price fell sharply to 7.7 taels, a drop of one cent compared to the previous day, and the market remained flat. The market for medium white sugar also tended to decline and received fewer inquiries. Tenth-grade Dutch red sugar traded at 6.475 taels with limited transactions, and the market was relatively stable. The Japanese sugar market also trended downward. YRO mark traded at 8.15 taels, YP mark at 8.5 taels, and YT mark at 8.3 taels. The market was unremarkable. The No. 10 Pagoda Green Sugar opened with several hundred bags yesterday, priced at 4.6 taels, which was very popular. Later, the asking price was 4.8 taels, but no transactions were made. Information suggested that the market was very strong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Prices Continue to Rise Madly</h3>
<p>Piece goods saw further gains yesterday, reaching unprecedented highs. The main reason is the extreme shortage of spot goods, which speculators took advantage of to aggressively push prices up. Brokers also continued to raise prices, resulting in a level of price disorder that has never been seen before. Western white flannel opened yesterday at a price of one tael higher than last year. Outer 26 Fengyu Railway opened at 14.5 taels, 24 at 13.25 taels, and Ruler 6 velvet, although not yet the peak sales season, was already active. Taihe Dangrenbei was selling for 8.25 taels, Gongping Tianci Huangjin for 8.75 cents, and Taihe Grand Stage for 9.75 cents. Local advances were quite high. Eastern Yuanzhi tribute satin rose again yesterday, with First Class merit already selling for 2.775 taels, Four Scholars for 2.65 taels, and Tianci Huangjin for 3 cents. Dyed red label, grey-gloss twill, and plain silk, etc., were almost impossible to find. Bleached cloth was also gradually increasing in price. Tianci Huangjin was at 8.85 taels, Dingfujun at 9.5 cents, and Magpie Bridge and Double President were both at 9.75 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Gaozhuang Zhenmei Tea of Wuyuan is Actively Sold in England</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Gaozhuang Zhenmei tea from Wuyuan's northern region, as well as tea from Baochang, Dute, Yongxing, Tongfu, and other firms, began to be sold. Donglu Zhenmei tea from Gongxi and Baitouzhuang also saw slight improvement in demand. The asking price remained at 170 taels. However, low-grade Zhenmei tea remained sluggish. Although there were sporadic transactions of needle tea and bud tea, market prices were low. Qimen black tea saw little trading, and Ningzhou black tea from English firms was ignored. The overall trend in the tea market remains high prices for good quality tea and low prices for poor quality tea.</p>
<h3>Most Summer Silkworms in Hangzhou Prefecture Found to Have White Muscardine Disease</h3>
<p>This year, farmers in various counties under Hangzhou prefecture suffered poor harvests of spring silkworms, so they all supplemented with summer silkworms. However, due to the cold weather and frequent thunderstorms, most of the silkworm larvae developed white muscardine disease and were lost during the third molt. Currently, the early batches are already in the spinning stage, and the late batches are also in the major molting stage, with abundant leaves. It is estimated that the cocoon production in each county will be at most only 50-60% of a normal year. It is estimated that 60-70% of the cocooneries that are rented out are prepared to open for business.</p>

<p>Local News: Shanghai Business Consolidation Association</p>
<h3>Actively Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>Each Chamber of Commerce Should Form a Specialized Committee</p>
<p>Rescuing the Situation of Expensive Gold and Cheap Silver is the Only Solution</p>
<p>In order to promote national goods and fundamentally rescue the situation of skyrocketing gold prices, the Business Consolidation Association yesterday specifically sent letters to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities nationwide to organize specialized committees for promoting national goods. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, Since the global market has gradually increased, our country's import and export trade and various commodity prices have been affected, resulting in significant losses. Due to our association's responsibilities and based on requests from various industries, we have repeatedly discussed remedies with the financial sector and various industry groups. After careful consideration, we have agreed with the Silver and Money Guild on four measures, which have been submitted to the Ministries of Finance and Industry and relevant Chinese and foreign businesses in this city for consideration and implementation. The full text was published in various newspapers in this city on June 13th. It is hoped that you have reviewed it. Our country's imports exceed its exports, and the difference has increased over the years. Therefore, the higher the gold price rises, the more unfavorable the exchange rate becomes, and the greater the international debt becomes. To reduce this type of damage, the only solution is to start by reversing the trade deficit and actively promote national goods to replace imported goods, reducing imports. Promoting national goods is one way to reverse the trade deficit. The term 'promoting national goods' has long become a common term in society. However, despite long being touted, it has not had a significant effect. It is not merely that various parties only care about promotion but cannot implement it. The blame also lies in only considering partial interests and failing to cooperate and promote with overall strength. Therefore, despite years of calls, the effect is still limited. For example, in the cigarette industry, promoting domestically produced cigarettes can restrain subordinates to earnestly comply, but for other domestically produced goods, because there is no personal interest, or even a delay in consideration. Other industries are the same. Secondly, party and government personnel have an obligation to lead by example, and the government has also issued repeated orders, but the reality and the document may not be consistent. If the party, government, and business sectors are still like this, then consumers will only seek convenience when purchasing and will not bother to distinguish carefully. Therefore, promoting national goods in the future should concentrate the power of the entire society and unite. The method should be for local chambers of commerce to organize specialized committees for promoting national goods, responsible for investigation, research, and publicity. On one hand, universally establish national goods cooperatives to seek convenience for the people to select national goods at any time and any place. This matter concerns reversing the national leakage. The business community holds the key to trade, and the chamber of commerce is the leader of businessmen. In name and in fact, there is no shirking responsibility. In addition to how the city's business consolidation association should cease operations pending the establishment of the city's chamber of commerce and transfer of responsibility, a corresponding copy of the case is submitted to you, and it is hoped that you will earnestly plan and actively handle it. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Amidst the Gold Rush</p>
<h3>Chinese Massively Buying Gold Certificates</h3>
<p>According to Investigation, Reaches 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Liu Da-jun Advocates Issuing Gold Public Bonds</p>
<p>Riri News reports that after the gold rush occurred, major Chinese stores and wealthy households, in order to protect their assets, have deposited their existing property into foreign banks to purchase gold stocks or gold public bonds to maintain their asset status. Yesterday, a gentleman said that Mr. Li Fu-sun, a giant in the banking industry in this city, investigated and found that Chinese people have purchased gold certificates worth 10 million yuan in the past week, which is truly shocking. The Riri News reporter inquired about this with economic expert Liu Da-jun yesterday, who said that the above is indeed the real situation. Although it can be said that Chinese people lack patriotism, it is also a state that should exist in the gold and silver rush. As evidenced by the fact that after the European and American war, although the United Kingdom and the United States stood in an enemy position, due to the gold rush relationship, a large number of British people purchased gold certificates from the United States. In order to maintain a country's finances, the government had no choice but to let it be. Considering China's current situation, the only way to rescue this tide is to issue gold public bonds as soon as possible. Because our country's tariffs have already been levied in gold, using tariffs as collateral will naturally allow people to purchase domestic gold public bonds, which may be able to salvage this huge leakage. This is also one of the methods to rescue the gold rush. I will soon submit a proposal to the government for adoption.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Issue</h3>
<h3>Tianjin Customs Staff Will Not Leave</h3>
<p>Yan Xishan Appoints Xin Bosen as the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, Tianjin Customs will soon be taken over. Yesterday, Reuters reported that the former Tianjin Customs Commissioner, Beile, said in a statement that whether the Tianjin Customs staff leave their posts depends on the reply from the Inspector General of Customs, and Xin Bosen also issued a statement saying that any Tianjin Customs staff who disobey orders or leave their duties without authorization will be shot. According to sources from the Inspectorate General of Customs, the Tianjin Customs issue is purely a political issue that requires negotiations between the Nanjing government and the North. The Inspector General of Customs has no power to intervene, and even within the diplomatic corps, various countries have recognized China's customs autonomy and find it difficult to interfere. As for the departure of all Tianjin Customs staff to the South, there is no such thing. Currently, Tianjin Customs affairs are still proceeding as usual. However, the Northern takeover of Tianjin Customs is indeed a serious issue because the customs system is like a bridge through which Chinese and foreign trade must pass, and the guarantee of domestic and foreign debt is even secondary. The Northern takeover of Tianjin Customs is tantamount to destroying the bridge of Chinese and foreign trade, with a huge impact on the customs system.</p>
<h3>Japanese Deputy Consul Tanaka Visits Commander Xiong</h3>
<p>Regarding the Conflict Between Wounded Soldiers and Japanese Students in Suzhou</p>
<p>The afternoon before yesterday, Mr. Tanaka, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Shanghai, visited Commander Xiong at the Longhua Garrison Command regarding the conflict between wounded soldiers and Japanese students in Suzhou. Commander Xiong happened to be on official business and sent Director Li to meet him instead. Initially, Adjutant-General Jiang greeted him, so Jiang and Li received him together. Tanaka first described the injuries suffered by students from Fukuoka, Japan, in a conflict with wounded soldiers outside the Suzhou Changmen Gate, saying that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily in Suzhou, but Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places all have wounded soldiers stationed there, and Japanese people often visit these places. He hopes that Commander Xiong will instruct the local authorities to protect them and prevent such accidents from happening again, and that this intention will be conveyed to Commander Xiong. Li replied that the details of the conflict are not yet available, and Commander Xiong dispatched Deputy Adjutant Zhao yesterday to investigate (according to reports, the conflict was due to a dispute over a donkey, and the wounded soldiers were also injured). However, the conflict did occur and there were indeed injuries, which is a misfortune for both China and Japan. The Garrison Command has already instructed the local officers to pay attention to the wounded soldiers, but this is an accidental private matter. Conflicts between people of the same country often happen, and conflicts between people of different countries also often happen. Foreign soldiers stationed in China also often have conflicts with Chinese people. Yesterday, the Garrison Command issued another order to all officers in both districts to pay close attention and to protect foreigners, and to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts with foreigners. Tanaka then took his leave.</p>

<h3>Wire City Government to Donate Funds</h3>
<p>Song Meiling et al. Send Urgent Telegram</p>
<p>Please Grant Additional Funds to Comfort the Meritorious</p>
<p>The Continental News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special Municipal Government received an urgent telegram from Song Meiling, the Standing Committee Member of the Capital Frontline Soldiers Comfort Association: "Mayor Yue and all Directors, last winter the army successfully put down the rebellion, achieving great success. Meiling et al. launched a comfort association, receiving generous support from the three armies. Now the rebel army has risen again, causing our armed comrades to fight between Longhai and Pinghan.

<p>French Business Water and Electricity Union</p>
<h3>Machine Department Went on Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute between the French Business Water and Electricity Company has been brewing for many days. Although various agencies have mediated several times, no results have been achieved. A strike was implemented yesterday. The details of the process are described in detail below:</p>
<p>The labor unrest has been brewing. The entire workforce of the French Business Water and Electricity Union's Machine Department, due to demands for improved treatment from the factory, submitted six conditions in the latter half of last month (already seen in the 17th issue of this newspaper, omitted). The factory then issued a notice completely rejecting it. The representatives were re-elected to request the factory again, but with no results. On the 14th of this month, the entire assembly resolved to make a third plea to the factory, but the factory continued to issue a notice with firm wording and no room for negotiation. Upon hearing this, all the workers were extremely angry. Therefore, it was decided by the entire assembly to go on strike completely on the 18th (yesterday).</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau was unable to mediate. The day before yesterday (the 17th), Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau specifically convened representatives from both parties at the bureau at 1 PM to conduct mediation in order to recover 1 out of 10,000. The labor representatives who arrived were Zhang Qixiang and Xu A-mei, both standing committee members of the union. However, the capital party turned a deaf ear and did not send representatives to attend, making it impossible for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. Until around 4 PM yesterday afternoon, the factory workers convened a general assembly of all workers in the company's plaza and resolved to implement a strike starting today to promote the capital party's awareness. Considering the small number of night shift workers, they were deeply concerned that the factory would take oppressive actions, so they also uniformly stopped working last night.</p>
<p>The union submitted a letter to the Municipal Civil Training Committee. The union submitted a letter to the Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee yesterday stating: (1) "Submitting this letter for the record because the capital party has rejected the demands of the association three times and the association has decided to go on strike on June 18. The association has been demanding conditions from the capital party for 28 days. Not only is there no room for negotiation, but it has been rejected three times in announcements. The workers in the factory are extremely angry and decided to go on strike together on June 18 to promote the capital party's awareness so that there is hope for negotiation. Because the strike is a matter of public convenience, it is hereby submitted to the Committee for review and permission to file the record to maintain the worker's movement and benefit its progress."</p>
<p>"Request to punish Ma Boxiang for colluding with the capital party to sabotage the worker's movement. The association's hired secretary, Ma Boxiang, is still considered qualified to this day, but during the association's workers' demands, he secretly colluded with the capital party and used various base methods to vigorously sabotage the worker's movement, thinking of obtaining a huge amount of money from the capital party and disregarding the interests of all the workers. All arrangements have been properly arranged and are waiting for the right moment to act. The facts will be listed below. Because this matter is counter-revolutionary and violates union discipline, it is hereby submitted to the Committee for review and clarification. The secretary has been detained and his accomplices will be identified so that they can be arrested and the truth can be revealed. As the association's entire workforce is on strike at the factory, the masses discussed how to deal with it. Upon learning of this, the workers were extremely angry and said that unless the secretary is severely punished, it will not be enough to deter others. Do not release this person without a formal request from the association. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<p>Precautions on the Chinese and French Sides. After the French Concession Police Department detected the trend of the union to implement a strike a few days ago, fearing that it would cause trouble, Director Salley of the Political Affairs Department secretly instructed his subordinates to pay close attention to the general class detectives. Yesterday, in addition to sending Chinese and Western Vietnamese detectives to strictly guard the vicinity of the Luciawan Company, he also ordered all general class detectives in the department to gather at the police station to await deployment. Because the union's address is located at No. 25 Minden Lane, Luban Road, in the Chinese Concession, a special telephone notification was sent to the Public Security Bureau. The detective team leader Lu selected several detectives to rush to the scene by car to implement precautions.</p>
<p>###美亞綢廠罷工續訊</p>
<p>Workers Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>Party and government organs jointly issued a proclamation regarding the strike of workers at the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, the United Second Branch Factory, the Tianlun Meiji Main Branch Factory, the Meifu Silk Factory, the Meicheng Silk Weaving Company, the Meisheng Silk Factory, and the Meili Silk Factory on the 10th. Yesterday morning, over 200 worker representatives went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the People's Training Committee, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to petition for the approval of their demands. Representatives from the People's Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau received them and gave instructions. The Municipal Party Headquarters, the People's Training Committee, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Regarding the joint proclamation, the labor-management dispute at the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory is currently under mediation and arbitration. Strikes during mediation and arbitration periods violate Article 33 of the Labor Dispute Resolution Law. According to Article 35 of the same law, penalties should be imposed. The authorities, considering that the majority of the workers have been incited by a small number of individuals, will refrain from further investigation, except for investigating and prosecuting the instigators according to the law. A joint proclamation is hereby issued, urging all workers to resume work immediately. Any delays will result in wage deductions. Be cautious and do not hesitate, lest you incur further consequences. This proclamation is issued on June 18, 1920. Chen Junyi, Standing Committee Member; Pan Gongzhan, Bureau Director."</p>
<p>Worker's appeal for help: "We have been oppressed by the capitalists to the point where we have no other choice but to unanimously and voluntarily go on strike. We respectfully announced to all sectors on June 10 the four conditions we have proposed. The reasons are extremely justified, and they are all based on the spirit of labor-management cooperation. Moreover, there are no excessive demands or extravagant hopes. Everything is within the capitalists' capabilities and can be easily accomplished. The first requirement is to reinstate the workers who were unjustly dismissed. The capitalists had no valid reason or legal basis for unjustly dismissing the workers, so of course, we demand reinstatement. The second requirement is to fulfill the conditions agreed upon by labor and management in 1927. At this time of skyrocketing gold prices and high costs of everything, the capitalists are already taking advantage of us by fulfilling the conditions set in the past. Yet they have unilaterally and completely revoked them. How can this be considered fair or reasonable? The third requirement is to return the savings deposits. Savings must be agreed upon by the labor side. This is explicitly stipulated in the Trade Union Law. However, the capitalists are using savings in name as their liquid funds in reality, so of course, we demand the return of savings. The fourth requirement is to revoke the temporary employment contract. The temporary employment contract is a temporary employment in nature. The capitalists invented this term so that if a worker does not meet his expectations, he can be replaced at any time without cause, putting workers at risk of unemployment at any time. In order to protect our own interests, of course, we must request the abolition. Such several requirements are the rights we deserve, and they are also the obligations that capitalists should fulfill. Therefore, we appeal to the authorities and comrades and compatriots from all walks of life to provide us with considerable spiritual and material assistance so that we can achieve a fair resolution in the shortest possible time and escape from the sea of suffering and live and work in peace. This is what we are praying for."</p>
<h3>上海縣催解冬漕</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Urges the Delivery of Winter Grain Tax</p>
<p>The district Baojia (community security) of Shanghai County were abolished on April 1st, and all the duties of the Baojia, such as collecting grain tax, are now managed by the township leaders. The Finance Bureau has found that there is a large amount of unpaid winter grain tax from the eighteenth year and has ordered the district tax collectors to strictly urge the payment. Later, the officials reported to the bureau that the township leaders were using excuses to delay the delivery of payment, making collection difficult. The bureau reported the situation to the county government for review. County Magistrate Yan stated that as the anti-rebellion military period is in progress, there is a great need for funds, and the township leaders, having accepted the clear order to manage the grain tax, should not be using excuses to evade their duty. Therefore, in addition to instructing the Finance Bureau to issue the amount of unpaid bills to the township leaders, he also ordered the district leaders to supervise and urge the payment so that it can be remitted and the country's tax obligations can be fulfilled.</p>
<h3>市縣清算公安經費</h3>
<p>City and County Settle Public Security Expenses</p>
<p>Bei Jietai, Director of the Finance Bureau of Baoshan County, was appointed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to go to the Shanghai Municipal Government together with the Finance Bureau of Shanghai County to settle the public security expenses of Shanghai and Baoshan counties. After receiving the order, Director Bei immediately presented the matter to the county government meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the method. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the subsidies from the municipal government to this county were not limited to public security expenses but also included education, household registration, agricultural fields, and county administrative expenses. It was decided that these matters should be handled together during the settlement. Director Bei has sent letters to the municipal government and the Shanghai County government to schedule a settlement date and has reported the situation to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to request instructions.</p>

<h3>關懷上海租界情形</h3>
<p>Concern for the Situation in the Shanghai Concession</p>
<p>Correspondence between Johnston and the Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association received a letter yesterday from Mr. Johnston of the Department of Political Science at Stanford University in California, USA. The translation reads: "Dear Sirs, I have been extremely concerned about all developments in your area in recent months, and I have paid particular attention to the Ratepayers' Foreign Association's refusal to increase the number of Chinese directors. I believe that this regressive action is sufficient to hinder future harmony and cooperation between Chinese and foreigners in the Public Concession. Recently, I read in the North-China Daily News a letter issued by your Association regarding the Ratepayers' Foreign Association (referring to the rebuttal of Mr. MacDonald's article), which was published to foreign ratepayers. I express my sympathy and admiration. The letter deeply understands the current situation and expresses a desire for cooperation for the great benefit of Shanghai. This will surely be understood by foreigners as well. I would welcome any indication of the opinions of your countrymen on the recent complex and changing issues. I intend to complete a study of the administration of the Public Concession and would be grateful if your Association could provide me with information. To the best of my knowledge, these events will remain unresolved for at least a year or two. If this observation is true, I will wait until I have thoroughly studied all the materials on hand to gain a better understanding. Any plans to come to Shanghai will be postponed until next year. I would be grateful if your Association could send me the books I desire and keep me informed of important news. I respectfully request your attention to this matter. Sincerely, William Johnston, May 22, 1930, Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association."</p>
<p>The Association immediately replied by telegram, saying: "Replying to your letter of May 22, we have learned with respect of your concern for all developments in Shanghai and your sympathy for our Association's declaration to increase the number of Chinese directors. We express our deep admiration. The case of the Chinese directors has now been completely resolved, and the five Chinese directors have officially taken office. This matter can be considered closed. Colleagues are eagerly awaiting the early completion of your study of Shanghai's administration so that they can have a preview. If you can come to Shanghai this year, you can meet Mr. Fei Tang, which would be excellent. Otherwise, it will not be too late to come east for investigation after Mr. Fei's report is published. We are sending you a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to Mr. Fei for your reference. etc."</p>
<h3>三井案之法律問題</h3>
<p>Legal Issues in the Mitsui Case</p>
<p>Arguments of Lawyer Zhang Rongxi</p>
<p>The cases in this port of Mitsui &amp; Co. suing He Gengxing, Hong Cangting, etc. for goods and bills were heard yesterday in the Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Rongxi raised the issue of the parties' capacity to sue, proving in court that the plaintiff lacked legal person status. The presiding judge ordered him to correct it, as previously reported. The reporter believes that this matter fully demonstrates the rigor of our judiciary. In the future, foreign companies must register in accordance with the law in order to enjoy complete legal protection. The exercise of our legal rights is particularly important. Therefore, I specially visited Lawyer Zhang Rongxi to inquire about the basis of his legal arguments. His detailed explanation was extremely insightful. Therefore, I will record it in sections to inform those who are concerned about legal rights. The following is a summary of Mr. Zhang's remarks: (1) The first thing to be examined in all litigation cases is whether the parties have the capacity to sue and whether there is a lack thereof. According to Article 53 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, litigation acts by persons without the capacity to sue are invalid. Therefore, if the examination is not clear at the beginning of the lawsuit, the lawsuit will proceed. If it is later discovered that the plaintiff or defendant does not have the capacity to sue, all previous litigation procedures will be invalid, wasting time and effort, which is detrimental to both the court and the parties. Therefore, Article 290 of the Civil Procedure Regulations also stipulates that if the plaintiff or defendant does not have the capacity to sue, the presiding judge should not set a date for oral argument and should make a judgment of dismissal. In other words, the court can dismiss the lawsuit without a hearing. It can be seen that the lack of capacity to sue is a fatal injury to the lawsuit and should not be ignored. (2) In the current case of Mitsui &amp; Co. suing He Hong, etc., Mitsui &amp; Co. is named as the plaintiff and claims in the complaint to be a Japanese limited company. There is no doubt that it is a foreign legal person. Whether a foreign legal person can claim its legal person status under Chinese law is of course determined by Chinese law. Before the implementation of our Civil Code, the precedents of the Dali Court absolutely did not recognize foreign firms as legal persons (see Dali Court Precedent No. 1158, Year 7). After the implementation of our new Civil Code, Article 11 of the Implementing Rules of the General Principles of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that foreign legal persons are not recognized unless otherwise provided by law. However, according to Article 13 of the same Implementing Rules, foreign legal persons who establish offices in China shall apply Article 30, etc., of the General Principles of the Civil Code. In general, foreign legal persons who establish offices in China can enjoy the capacity to sue if they comply with the regulations for Chinese legal persons. According to Article 30 of the Civil Code, a legal person may not be established without registration with the competent authority. According to Article 45, the acquisition of legal person status by an association for profit is governed by special law. According to Article 8 of the current special law, the Company Ordinance, the establishment of a company may not be asserted against third parties without registration. That is, a company that has not been registered may not claim that it is a company to the outside world, that is, it may not claim that it has the status of a legal person. According to the above-mentioned laws and regulations, it is clear that a foreign company that establishes an office in China must not claim that it is a legal person unless it is registered with the competent authority in the location of the office. This is a legal case like a mountain drill. (3) According to Article 52, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Procedure Regulations, a person with the capacity to have rights has the capacity to sue. Therefore, all companies that cannot claim to have the status of a legal person do not have the capacity to sue because they do not have the capacity to have rights. Therefore, Mitsui &amp; Co. does not have the capacity to be a plaintiff under Chinese law. According to the law, the court can dismiss its lawsuit, but it can also order it to correct it. The correction is to register with the Chinese government in accordance with the law to legally obtain the status of a legal person. This is the proper way. To file a lawsuit with a natural person as the plaintiff is to change the subject of the lawsuit and is not purely a correction. It is not legally impermissible for a foreign legal person to file a lawsuit with its director or general manager as the plaintiff, but it must be limited to the legal acts handled by that individual. The reason why a director or general manager can file a lawsuit is not because he is the representative of the company but because he is the party to the legal act. Therefore, if it is not a matter signed and handled by that individual, that individual does not have the capacity to sue. Some people may think this is troublesome, but the difference between a legal person and a non-legal person lies in this point. If you want to avoid this trouble, you can register as a legal person in accordance with the law as soon as possible. In addition, the directors and managers of the company can file a lawsuit in the capacity of agents of all shareholders, which can also avoid the aforementioned trouble, but in this way, the company becomes a partnership, and each shareholder should bear unlimited liability, which is even more unfavorable to the company. (4) A foreign legal person that has not been registered may not be a party to a lawsuit. This is a general rule of Chinese law and is not unique to Mitsui &amp; Co. Moreover, this legal system is a common practice in civilized countries and is not a special case in China. Chinese people must go through various permits and registration procedures to obtain the status of a legal person and be protected by law. It is absurd for a foreign legal person to want to enjoy the same protection as a Chinese legal person without going through various procedures. Under the current Chinese system, foreign legal persons who comply with the regulations for Chinese legal persons, regardless of the type of legal person, can receive the same protection as Chinese legal persons. Its attitude is indeed fair. Compared with the Japanese legal system, which in practice has almost no way to recognize other foreign legal persons other than national administrative divisions and commercial companies, it must be said to be generous. In the past, foreigners in China have made every effort to assert the rights granted by law and sought to avoid the obligations imposed by law. This has created inequality in everything. Company registration is also one of them. I have raised this important argument in accordance with the law this time to uphold the great spirit of equality between Chinese and foreigners in our law, to correct the bad habits of foreigners who do not comply with the law and avoid obligations, and to protect foreigners under the law equally with Chinese people. This is not only directed at the Mitsui case. I hope that those who talk about legal rights in the country will pay attention to it."</p>

<h3>日紗商受金市打擊</h3>
<p>Japanese Yarn Merchants Hit by Gold Market</p>
<p>Imports of Japanese Yarn Reduced by Half</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Mills Are in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a commercial officer at the Japanese Embassy, the import of Japanese cotton yarn to various provinces in China has fallen sharply due to the impact of high gold prices, low silver prices, and low exchange rates. According to a survey in May, the total import of Japanese yarn in China has decreased by more than 45% compared with the past. As a result, yarn mills in various parts of Japan have reduced their working hours and are presenting a semi-suspended image. The same is true for Japanese-owned yarn mills in Shanghai, Hankou, Qingdao, and other places. The latest survey of the strength of yarn mills in China, Britain, and Japan is as follows:</p>
<p>China: This year, there are a total of 81 mills with 15,955 spindles and 2,326,872 spindles. Last year, there were 16,787 spindles and 2,223,528 spindles. Comparatively speaking, the number of spindles has increased significantly.</p>
<p>Britain: This year, there are a total of 3 mills with 1,900 spindles and 153,320 spindles. The number of machines and spindles was the same last year.</p>
<p>Japan: This year, there are a total of 43 yarn mills with 11,467 spindles and 1,489,360 spindles. Last year, there were 1,397,272 spindles. Comparatively, there has been an increase in the number of spindles, but the quantity of its products has been reduced by more than half.</p>
<h3>中外商輪擱淺損機訊</h3>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Merchant Ships Grounded and Damaged, but All Are Safe</p>
<p>Nagasaki Maru Suffers Engine Damage. The Nagasaki Maru, a liaison ship of the Japan Mail Line, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th and return to Japan on the afternoon of the 18th, encountered engine damage after leaving Japan. The ship could not move, so the shipowner ordered it to stop and be repaired by on-board technicians. It was not until 20 hours later that it could sail, so the ship arrived in Shanghai one day late, and the departure date was also postponed by one day.</p>
<p>The Tonghua Ship Aground. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua Ship, which had just been repaired in Shanghai, ran aground on its first trip to Haizhou. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the shipowner, Mr. Bei Ni, sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that the Tonghua Ship had run into Dabu because the lake water had receded greatly. The Tonghua Ship was carrying a lot of cargo and had a deep draft. After the tide receded there, there was only seven feet and six inches of water. The Tonghua Ship was grounded and the hull was stuck in the sand and could not move. After receiving the report, the Shanghai Bureau immediately sent a telegram to the Haizhou Branch to send a large barge to Dabu to unload the cargo from the Tonghua Ship to make it float on the water. The cargo on board was cigarettes, white sugar, cloth, and cotton yarn. It was being unloaded yesterday, and it should be able to get out of danger in a day or two. The ship itself was not damaged, and the passengers were safe.</p>
<p>German Ship Out of Danger. The German merchant company Hengbao's Bagenland Ship, which arrived in Shanghai from Germany this time, carried more than 6,000 tons of imported goods to China, including hardware and groceries. When the ship arrived in Singapore, it went off course due to fog and entered a shallow beach. The ship was heavily loaded and had a deep draft, so it was grounded. The shipowner sent a telegram for help, and the company transferred a ship from the South Seas to tow it. After a week, it was unable to get out of danger. Then the company sent a barge to unload all the cargo from the ship, and the ship was able to float on the water. It was heard yesterday that it had been towed to Hong Kong and could arrive in Shanghai in a week. It is said that the cargo in each cabin was not damaged, but the import period was delayed by more than ten days.</p>
<h3>滬航商討論撈船辦法</h3>
<p>Shanghai Shipping Merchants Discuss Salvage Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Shipping Company has specifically raised the issue of who should be responsible for salvaging sunken ships in the port for research. According to Article 23 of the Maritime Law, the responsibility seems to rest entirely with the shipowner, but according to the customs port management regulations, if a ship is sunk in the port or nearby and obstructs navigation, the shipping company should remove it within the time limit set by the port director, otherwise the customs will remove or bomb it on their behalf. However, the carefully translated English original chapter does not have the meaning of "on their behalf", and the cost is not specified as to who should bear it. According to the Maritime Law, the shipowner's loss is huge, and according to the port regulations, the shipowner's responsibility is not clear, resulting in major disputes in the salvage cases of the Yuanlikangtai and other ships, and there is no way to adapt. The Shanghai Shipping Association has decided to investigate the precedents in detail, refer to the usual practices, and propose a definite method to petition the authorities. A general letter has been sent to the shipping companies to quickly report to the association those who have handled this case for verification.</p>

<h3>亳縣災民代表乞振電</h3>
<p>Representatives of Disaster Victims in Bo County Plead for Relief</p>
<p>To All Newspapers and Charitable Organizations: Bo County has suffered from rampant bandits, frequent wars, and natural and man-made disasters in recent years. Last year, the Huanghui rebellion in southern Bo burned and looted dozens of miles of houses, and the people were displaced and left to die. Just as they were hoping to rest and recover, war broke out last month. Bo City was located in a strategic position, and tens of thousands of people suffered from the siege. Bullets and artillery fire made it impossible to know when they would die. The two sides held each other for more than a month, searching for food and firewood until they were exhausted. Hungry and starving people died on the streets. In addition, airplanes dropped bombs every day, accidentally injuring many civilians. The dead were scattered with blood and flesh, and the survivors were crying for food. Even more, the livestock in the countryside was transferred for military use, and the farmers were about to run out of food for plowing. Half-ripe wheat seedlings were cut for horse fodder, cutting off future livelihood. This is a catastrophe unprecedented in history, even more severe than Guiding in Henan. We implore compatriots at home and abroad to embrace our sufferings, have compassion, and generously donate huge sums of money to save the refugees, so that the hundreds of thousands of lives in Bo County will be grateful for the grace of rebirth.</p>
<p>Representatives of Disaster Victims in Bo County: Guo Wencai, Li Xiangding, Zhang Ying, Li Xianyi, Guo Shishen, and others kowtow with sincerity.</p>

<p>Since Dr. Liu Maochu took over the Local Procuratorate in this port, he has vigorously enforced the prohibition of opium without leaving any effort. Opium cases are solved every day, so the seized property warehouse is full of confiscated opium and opium paraphernalia. As a rule, the High Court is petitioned every year to send members to burn them publicly twice to clear the toxic atmosphere. Now, Chief Liu believes that the opium and opium paraphernalia from the second half of the eighteenth year should be burned as soon as possible. He has submitted a report to the High Court, which has set the date for burning as the 21st of this month. At that time, in addition to the Ministry of Justice and the High Court sending members to the court to supervise the burning, letters have also been sent to various agencies to send members to the scene to show caution.

<p>Municipal Public Works Bureau</p>
<h3>代裝代管私有路燈</h3>
<p>Install and Manage Private Street Lights on Behalf</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau is responsible for managing street lights within the city, limited to public roads. The equipment and management of private street lights in alleys and other places are the responsibility of the owners. In the past, it was noted that many alleys did not have street lights or that the installed street lights were not properly installed, which not only made it inconvenient for residents to enter and exit but also made it easy for criminals to hide in the darkness, which had an impact on public safety. Therefore, the bureau, together with the Public Security Bureau, promulgated the "Rules for the Prohibition of Private Street Lights." Recently, in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the rules, the "Measures for the Public Works Bureau to Install and Manage Private Street Lights on Behalf" were drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The measures are as follows: (A) Measures for Representing Private Street Lights (1) The bureau installs these street lights on behalf, and the owners manage them themselves. The ownership also belongs to the owners. (2) The private street lights installed on behalf of the bureau are temporarily divided into No. 1 and No. 2. The types are selected according to the current situation of the alleys. The cost of labor and materials for each No. 1 light is 10 yuan, and the cost of labor and materials for each No. 2 light is 5 yuan. All additional equipment, such as distribution panels, wires, magnetic materials, and wire carriers, are charged accordingly. (3) If the owner requests the bureau to install private street lights on behalf, the owner shall fill out an application form for installing private street lights on behalf, affix the seal, and submit it to the bureau along with the required labor and material fees and electricity deposit, and obtain a receipt. The bureau will then send a craftsman to install the lights. (4) If the owner wishes to change to the bureau to manage on behalf, it shall be handled in accordance with Articles 2 to 5 of the "Measures for Managing Private Street Lights on Behalf." However, the labor and material fees collected during the previous installation will not be refunded, and the ownership of the street lights will still belong to the owners. (B) Measures for Managing Private Street Lights on Behalf (1) These street lights must be installed on behalf of the bureau in order to standardize the style and facilitate management, but only management fees are charged, and no labor and material fees are charged. The ownership of the street lights belongs to the bureau. (2) The monthly management fee for each No. 1 light is 1.5 yuan, and the monthly management fee for each No. 2 light is 1 yuan. The fee is paid in advance on a monthly basis. If the management period is less than one month, it will also be calculated as one month. (3) The electricity fee is calculated by meter, and the owner shall pay it to the gas company. (4) If the owner requests the bureau to manage private street lights on behalf, the owner shall fill out an application form for managing private street lights on behalf, affix the seal, and submit it to the bureau along with the first month's management fee and electricity deposit, and obtain a receipt. The bureau will then send a craftsman to install the lights and manage them on behalf. (5) All repair and replacement work is the responsibility of the bureau. If the owner wants to take back the management in the middle, the labor and material fees and ancillary equipment costs must be reimbursed to the bureau in accordance with the measures in Item A, and the ownership of the street lights will be transferred to the owner.</p>

<p>Shanghai News Two bandits collude</p>
<h3>Patrols repeatedly rob</h3>
<p>Serving as public servants and breaking the law</p>
<p>Eight people were sentenced to five years each</p>
<p>And sent to the inland government for interrogation</p>
<p>Bandits Zhao Jingbin, Jia Zhenbiao, Zhao Peizhen, Li Kunshan, Yu Xiushan, Zhao Mingshan, etc., colluded with Liu Bingsheng, patrol officer No. 480 of the French General Patrol Room, and Kang Shulin, a family servant of a certain surname in the Public Concession, to rob Xu Xiuting at No. 7 Renji Lane, Huacheng Road, Shi Zhiqiong at No. 5 Nian'an Lane, Baxianqiao, Fei Jinlin at No. 15 Yuqing Lane, Xinxinqiao Street, Xu Wang at No. 2 Deren Lane, Baxianqiao, Fang Caizhen at No. 3 Qingpingfang, Huanghe Road, Zhang Fuyuan at No. 8 Xieping Lane, Xiafei Road, and other six families of clothing, jewelry, cash, and other huge stolen goods, which were pledged and divided for use. The victims reported to the patrol room for arrest. The special agency detectives of the French patrol room, inspector Jin Jiulin, chief detective Li Yaolong, deputy detective Qian Yumin, Wang Rusong, Mao Jingen, bao detective Zhang Ziying, Qin Youyu, Zhou Yaoting, etc., learned the hiding place of the bandits and immediately rushed to arrest the six bandits including Zhao and the two patrols, and confiscated four pistols. They also successively obtained suspected Cao Lishan, Lu Shuquan, Shao Yanliang, and women Jia Wang, Liu Li, and Lu Wu, and brought them into the patrol room. After the patrol chief interrogated them one by one, he ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, he summoned the victims and escorted the defendants to the French public hall. Judge Zhu, together with French Consul General Julan Jun, opened a special criminal court for investigation. First, the plaintiffs stated the circumstances of the robbery, and Zhao Jingbin, Jia Zhenbiao, Zhao Peizhen, Li Kunshan, Yu Xiushan, Zhao Mingshan, Liu Bingsheng, and Kang Shulin confessed that they had colluded to rob the plaintiffs' homes. Cao Lishan, Lu Shuquan, and Shao Yanliang confessed that the civilians did not dare to collude to rob and requested a clear investigation. Jia Wang, Liu Li, and Lu Wu confessed that the women were familiar with Jia Zhenbiao, Liu Bingsheng, and Lu Shuquan, but did not know that they were thieves. Then, Western Detective Chief Sacail reported that Liu Bingsheng, patrol officer No. 480 of the patrol room, and Kang Shulin, a doorman of the Public Concession, dared to collude with thieves to commit robbery and break the law. He requested a severe punishment.

Shao Yanliang was released, and the rest were expelled from the concession forever. The four pistols involved in the case were confiscated.</p>
<p>Cascia</p>
<h3>Attempts to Eliminate Crime</h3>
<p>Cascia is originally an American</p>
<p>Changed to Mexican citizenship for gambling</p>
<p>Now seeking to return to his hometown</p>
<p>There are still problems entering the United States</p>
<p>Mexican Overseas Chinese Cascia was sentenced to one year in prison and fined by the former Provisional Court for privately establishing a roulette gambling house, and was imprisoned until the 13th of this month before being released with his accomplice Faner. According to those familiar with Cascia's history, Cascia was originally an American. The reason for his change of citizenship was purely for illegal business. Cascia was addicted to gambling. American law severely punishes gambling crimes. Looking around the world, only Mexico treats gambling offenders leniently. The most severe punishment is a fine of 500 yuan and 30 days of detention. Cascia saw the profit and forgot his feelings, and resolutely left his motherland to seek the protection of other countries. He came to Shanghai to open a gambling house. Even when he was caught in the net, the foreign overseas Chinese enjoyed consular jurisdiction due to the incomplete Sino-Mexican treaty. Even if he was sent to the Mexican Consulate in Shanghai, the impact of the criminal law according to his country's laws was limited, so he did not care at first. He knew that the Sino-Mexican treaty had been declared invalid by our country, and Judge Wu Jingxiong, who heard the case, also accepted the first case of a foreigner in the Chinese court and sentenced him according to law. This was really beyond Cascia's expectations. Although he has been released from prison, he has no intention of staying in Shanghai. Moreover, all his property and family members are in the United States, and he is eager to return to the United States to change his career and tell the family. However, the import laws of the United States are strict and unparalleled. Anyone who has violated the criminal code and tasted the flavor of iron windows is rejected from entering the country. Cascia is well versed in the American situation, so he does not dare to go rashly. However, if he does not return, not only will his property be lost and his family will be separated forever, but also there will be nowhere to live in the vast world. He now plans to find a way to eliminate the crime he has suffered, and has decided on two plans: (1) To appeal to the Supreme Court of the capital to request the revocation of the judgment of the two trials and declare him innocent. (1) To proceed from the diplomatic aspect. Cascia still insists that the Sino-Mexican treaty was actually declared invalid on October 24, 1929, and that Mexico still enjoyed consular jurisdiction when he was sentenced. As for which way Cascia will choose to proceed, it is not yet determined. As for whether the result will be as he wishes, it is even more difficult to say.</p>
<p>Ni Wenjuan</p>
<h3>Details the Suffering of Marrying a Husband</h3>
<p>Sues for divorce from her husband</p>
<p>Suffered abuse from her husband's family</p>
<p>Sometimes threatened with a handgun</p>
<p>Defendant denies everything</p>
<p>Zhou Weixin, who lives at No. 2100, Dongyouheng Road, is now working at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. His wife died early. On November 19, 16 years ago, he hired a matchmaker to marry a Ni woman named Wenjuan from No. 2 Jinkang Lane, Xundao Street, Dadongmen, in the city as his second wife. Wenjuan's appearance was not outstanding and it was difficult to please Zhou. Her parents-in-law, Zhou Zhaoxiong and Zhou Zhu, did not like her, and Wenjuan suffered greatly from the abuse. It has been difficult to tolerate until now, so she hired a lawyer to file a divorce lawsuit in the Special Zone District Court, and also listed the names of her parents-in-law. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu informed the plaintiff's attorney, Wang Liangqing, that since the divorce was sued, it did not involve the parents-in-law. If it was said that there was abuse and injury, it was a criminal matter and should be sued in the criminal court to avoid confusion. He also asked the plaintiff what he was asking for. The attorney stated that the plaintiff only requested a divorce and asked to approve the withdrawal of the lawsuit against the parents-in-law. Then, according to Ni Wenjuan, she was 22 years old. After marrying, she was disliked and despised for her ugly appearance. Later, she was forced to hand over her gold bracelets and other jewelry, otherwise she would be beaten and insulted. On the 10th of last month, because the child wanted to drink tea and there was no boiling water, she was beaten again and threatened with a handgun. The mother-in-law often helped the perpetrator to report to the Huishan Patrol Room. The patrol room filed a complaint and temporarily returned to her mother's home. Two days later, she was sent by her mother, but on the 15th, she was beaten again and injured in many places, and she was expelled. She reported to the patrol room again. Because of her serious injuries and coughing up blood, she went to Baolong Hospital for treatment and had an injury report. The woman also said that if she was divorced, she would never marry again because she had suffered the pain of marrying a husband. She would rather spend her days alone. The defendant, Zhou Weixin, denied the abuse and was willing to continue to live together. His parents also came to the court and swore to the sky that all those who eat five grains would not want to use violence to abuse the younger generation. Finally, Prosecutor Guo came to the court to express his opinion, and Judge Xu announced that the judgment would be announced on the morning of the 24th of this month.</p>
<p>Chen Aizhu</p>
<h3>Unwilling to Marry a Bad Person</h3>
<p>Sues for annulment of marriage</p>
<p>Defendant expresses unwillingness</p>
<p>Chen Aizhu, a woman from Pudong, is 17 years old this year. Her biological parents were originally surnamed Yao. When she was three years old, she was adopted by Chen Zhangsheng from Lan Nidu, Pudong, as her daughter, so she changed her surname to Chen. Chen Zhangsheng remarried Aizhu to his nephew Chen Azhu as his wife. They had already chosen to marry on March 16 this year, but Aizhu ran away before the marriage, which made it difficult to achieve a good thing. Now Aizhu has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the District Court to annul the marriage. The case was heard by Judge Tong yesterday. The plaintiff, Chen Aizhu, stated that she requested to annul the marriage with her fiancé because he often made friends with bad people and did not do business. When she was betrothed, she was very young and was the master of her adopted father Chen Zhangsheng. Now that I know, I don't want to. I don't know how much betrothal gift was received at that time. He and his old man Tang Baobao were detained for robbing the Jiang Pujiang Bureau's salary and silver case. Not many days ago, he also robbed the children's gold rings in Qichangzhai, which was handled by the Public Security Bureau. The defendant, Chen Azhu, stated that he was 23 years old and lived in Chenjiamen, Qichangzhai, Pudong, also known as Xiandangshang. He worked as a handyman in the Yangshupu Electric Light Company and did not join the bad party. He did not have an old man, only an old grandfather who had died. I betrothed her the year before last, and I paid the betrothal gift of 280 yuan on August 12 last year. We agreed to marry on March 16 this year. Unexpectedly, she ran away and I still want to ask for her back. I don't want to annul the marriage, etc. The official then said to the plaintiff, "You are not yet an adult. According to law, you should file a lawsuit together with your parents or adopted parents before you can handle it, and you should wait for the investigation institute to list the fiancé's misconduct before proceeding with the trial." Therefore, he announced that he would be summoned again and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Adding Clauses to Dance Hall Licenses</h3>
<p>The employed must report the list</p>
<p>The Bureau of Works has profound significance</p>
<p>The China News says that the Bureau of Works has recently added clauses to the dance hall license, requiring the licensee to report the list of dancers employed to the Bureau of Works. Some people think that this move will only increase the burden on those involved and will not be beneficial, while those who work as dancers also think that it is inconvenient to keep their names on record forever. However, it is heard that the Bureau of Works added new clauses to assist the police authorities in curbing crimes in the concession and to avoid dance halls from ignoring the police regulations and employing or accommodating people under the age of 15 to dance in the hall. It is also learned that the patrol room is now planning to strictly monitor people who work as dancers in accordance with the new regulations, because there are a few people who are suspected of colluding with criminals. In the past, due to the lack of appropriate regulatory regulations, they were quite obstructed during the investigation.</p>
<h3>The Health Bureau cares for meat merchants in various districts</h3>

<h3>Tense Work of the Film Inspection Committee</h3>
<p>The Film Inspection Committee of this city has been established for nine months, and has been sparing no effort in inspecting films on weekdays, so the achievements are quite impressive. As the 18th year of this session is coming to an end, the number of film companies and cinemas that send films to the meeting for inspection is more than before, which makes the staff overwhelmed. It is heard that the committee is also planning to expand its work for the 19th year.</p>
<h3>Fourth Diary of the Public Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Many new exhibits added</p>
<p>Yesterday was the fourth day of the public art exhibition in this city. Although it was drizzling, the visitors to the exhibition hall in the Yimiao Neiyuan were still in an endless stream, especially crowded in the afternoon. A total of more than 1,500 people. Because in the past three days, the primary school students of various schools no longer took care of the teachers when they entered the exhibition hall, which hindered the order of the show, so from yesterday onwards, no matter what school, all primary school students under the age of 16 were not allowed to enter the hall unless they were led by the teachers in formation. It is heard that there are some works added to the exhibits. The reporter of the Shenbao Picture Weekly also brought a camera and used magnesium light to capture some pieces.</p>
<h3>Wu Shihua's Child Custody Case Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Wenhui Daily reported that Wu Shihua, an overseas Chinese, brought his three-year-old adopted son back from the United States, but his wife in the United States also wanted to get this son and reported to the police station, so on the day of arrival in Shanghai, his adopted son was detained by the US Police Department according to the order of his country. Wu then hired lawyer Roger to request the US Police Department to open a trial and return the son immediately. This morning (18th), the trial was opened by the US Police Department. His wife hired a lawyer from New York to represent lawyer Davis to appear in court. According to Wu, he is 50 years old and has been in the United States for 12 years. He has opened a restaurant and a cigar store in New York. Three years ago, an American woman brought her two-week-old baby to the restaurant and said that she had no money to pay for medical expenses and asked if anyone wanted to adopt her son. He then negotiated with her to adopt the son and signed a contract. The woman was about 26 years old. According to her, the child's father was also a Chinese who studied at the university. Later, this person also came to his store. Although his husband and wife adopted this son together, he was always responsible for the upbringing. This child was really not what his wife could have. As for his wife, who was originally from Ireland, she got married a year before raising this son, but she repeatedly eloped, which was outrageous. She has a bad reputation in New York and everyone knows it. It was a big mistake for him to marry her. He was deeply afraid of the fierceness of his wife, so he abandoned everything and left home. Once, when he returned home, his wife threatened him with a gun and waited in the garden for half an hour before he could enter the room. His cigar store was originally worth 14,000 gold yuan, but he sold it at a low price of 8,000 gold yuan because he was eager to go to the United States. After that, all the belongings in the family were taken away by his wife. Now he plans to take the child to Hong Kong to do business and does not want to return to New York. When he first went to New York, he made a living by performing magic tricks, and then accumulated funds to set up a laundry and finally opened three restaurants and one cigar store. His wife is 26 years old, etc. The case continued to be heard in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Shen Family Property Dispute Reconciled</h3>
<p>Shen Pengfei participated in part of the waiting judgment. Shen Guozuo, a local, hired lawyer Wang Fushang to tell his cousin Shen Xinqi in the District Court that he had seized the inheritance of his uncle Yang Zhougong. The defendant, Shen Xinqi, also hired lawyer Wen Chao to file a defense. The trial has been opened several times and has not been concluded. All the details have been recorded in the previous report. Now Shen Pengfei and his mother Shen Tang also hired a lawyer to participate in the lawsuit for the inheritance issue. In the afternoon, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the sixth court for trial. According to Shen Pengfei, he is 31 years old and lives in Waicangqiao No. 69, Shanghai. He works in the Riye Bank and requested to overturn the previous inheritance settlement record. He also said that in April of the tenth year of the Republic of China, he had a settlement with Shen Qin (ie, Yang Zhou's wife) as a result of the litigation. Qin gave the participant 500 yuan for marriage expenses. But at that time, the participant did not appear in court, only the lawyer represented him. The official asked, "You didn't know that the settlement abolished the inheritance?" The answer was, "Yes." According to Shen Xinqi, he is 53 years old and lives at No. 352 Fangbang Road, Shanghai. He opened the Huafeng Leather Store. He asked, "Your son Linsheng and your nephew Guozuo are involved in the issue of establishing an heir?" "Pengfei had already abolished the inheritance," he replied. According to Shen Guozuo, he is 25 years old and lives at No. 58, Huiguan Street, Shanghai. He asked, "Pengfei told you and Shen Xinqi that you should not inherit?" "The litigation has already been in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Pengfei abolished the inheritance and declared it in the newspaper," he replied. The official then asked, "Why did Pengfei wait for so many years until Shen Guozuo and Shen Xinqi filed a lawsuit before you came out to participate?" "Because I had no money, I delayed," he replied. At this point, lawyer Wang started to speak, "Please ask the court whether Pengfei can say that he does not admit that he did not attend the court. Besides, whether the 500 yuan for marriage expenses was used or not." The official immediately read the previous volume. Pengfei did not attend the court, so lawyer Yao Wenshou had full power to represent him. At this point, lawyer Wen Chao started to speak and requested reconciliation outside the court. The official said, "It is more convenient to reconcile in court." He then asked Shen Xinqi how much the inheritance under Yang Zhou's name was worth. "About 5,000 to several hundred yuan," he replied. "Is Pengfei your nephew?" he asked. "Yes," he replied. The official then ordered that all the inheritance be divided into ten shares. Guozuo got four and a half shares, Xinqi's son Linsheng got four and a half shares, and Pengfei got one share. As for the inheritance issue, Guozuo and Linsheng inherited it together. Lawyer Wang started to speak, "This lawyer advises Guozuo to suffer a little in terms of property, but the inheritance should still be inherited by Guozuo alone." Xinqi expressed his opposition. Lawyer Wang then asked the court whether Pengfei had any sons. Pengfei replied that Xinqi had no sons and expressed his unwillingness to make ten shares of reconciliation. The official then ordered the witnesses Shen Zijing, Shen Zichou, etc. to testify about everything. The official then asked Lei Prosecutor to come to the court to express his opinion. The official then announced that all the inheritance under Yang Zhou's name would be divided into ten shares, and Shen Guozuo and Shen Xinqi's son Linsheng would each get five shares. Both parties expressed satisfaction and the reconciliation was established. The part of Shen Pengfei's participation was deemed to be the end of the debate and was scheduled to be announced on the 21st of this month. The court was then adjourned.</p>

The defendant, Zhang Liuzhen, also hired lawyer Wang Youlin to defend her. Yesterday morning, presiding Judge Guo Shouyi opened the court for trial. First, the plaintiff, Cai Xingju, testified that he was 23 years old, from Shanghai, residing in Lannidu, Pudong. On December 22nd of the 14th year of the Republic of China, he married Liuzhen. After she entered the family, she demanded to manage the property. Because his mother was still alive, he refused. In early December of the 15th year, she made an excuse to return to Ningbo and has not returned since. He has gone to pick her up many times, but to no avail. Therefore, he filed this lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering cohabitation. The defendant, Zhang Liuzhen, testified that she was 25 years old, from Pudong, currently residing in her brother's house in Beixinjing. (Question) What is the plaintiff to you? (Answer) Husband. The judge said: Since you are husband and wife, you should live together. (Answer) He beat me out. (Question) Is there any evidence? (Answer) Sticks and benches. (Question) Did anyone see it? (Answer) No. (Question) Are you willing to go back? (Answer) No. The judge said: You say you don't want to, is that it? There is no such easy thing. (Answer) I used to be willing. If I don't want to, what's the point of worshiping heaven and earth? The judge said: Then it's still better to go back and reunite as husband and wife. If there is abuse, you can come to the court to report it. (Answer) I don't want to go. At this point, the defendant's lawyer rose and said that the defendant had filed for divorce in the French Concession Court on the 3rd of this month, and the plaintiff was residing in the French Concession. The judge ordered the debate to begin and then invited Prosecutor Li to come to the court to state his opinion.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor: The "Local News" column of your newspaper yesterday published a section on the responsibility of guarantors for overdue loans. After reading it, it clearly does not conform to the facts. The borrower, Xiao Zhihe, and the guarantor, Yuan Shun Pawnshop owner Xiao Chaoshi, are brothers. The loan was taken out for nearly four years until the lawsuit, not six years. The guarantor did not state a six-month period on the loan agreement. The guarantor, Xiao Chaoshi, also paid the interest on schedule. Now, the borrower, Xiao Zhihe, has disappeared. According to the contract, the loan is being recovered from his brother, the guarantor, Yuan Shun Pawnshop owner Xiao Chaoshi. However, Xiao Chaoshi himself did not go to court, only his lawyer was present. Please publish this letter to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Du Runsheng, Yikangzhuang, Tianzhujie, Xinbeimenwai, this city. 19.6.18</p>
<p>To the editor: I have read the news "Resolution of British and American Labor Unrest" in today's newspaper. At the end, it says that the working hours of workers in British and American tobacco factories have always been ten hours a day, and now the union has submitted a request to the National Government to order the factory to change to nine hours a day to adjust the spirit of the workers. The factory also uniformly complied with this from yesterday. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. Our company's tobacco factory has been implementing a nine-hour system since Monday, the 16th of this month. The union did not know about it beforehand. Please publish this letter to correct it. Sincerely, British American Tobacco Company (Limited), Shanghai Branch. June 18, 1930</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Educational Inspection in Japan (4)</h3>
<p>(Hu Shuyi)</p>
<p>Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School is a well-known research school in Kyoto. I visited it on the morning of the 22nd. Due to time constraints, I did not go to the main campus of the Higher Normal School and its affiliated middle school. However, I observed the affiliated primary school and kindergarten in detail. At that time, a female student from a women's higher normal school in our country was doing research work at the school. I asked her to act as an interpreter. I learned that the primary school has three departments. The first department is a girls' group, divided into elementary primary school and higher primary school, a total of six grades. The second department is a composite system with boys and girls in the same class. The third department is a multi-grade system dedicated to experimentation and research. Each grade has no more than thirty students. They are currently experimenting with two methods of diligent study and free study. The most popular work education in modern Japan is also this method. This method actually originated in Germany and combines the spirit of American guidance and design methods. I will write another article to describe it in detail. The school's facilities in terms of teaching include a children's library, a children's museum, a school garden, off-campus teaching, art exhibitions, and self-study regulations, not just classroom teaching as the only method. This is its advantage. In terms of training, there are self-government committees, children's homework, excursions, sports meets, training sessions, and other organizations. Training is centered on children's homework, which is a secret formula for training. In terms of care, there are morning meetings, painting meetings, exercise time, health facilities, development surveys, and school nurses. Particular attention is paid to health facilities and development surveys. I asked about the training goals and learned that there are five items: simplicity, steadfastness, order, cooperation, and autonomy. Then I visited the affiliated kindergarten and learned that it does not belong to the primary school department and has a separate principal in charge. It seems that the kindergarten and the primary school are absolutely two stages. Whether the kindergarten should be merged with the primary school and whether there should be communication is an excellent educational research problem. I will discuss it with educators in Tokyo when I have time. During the visit, the nannies gave me many printed materials, all of which were practical materials. The children sang and played, lively and innocent, which was very lovely. In the afternoon, I went to the Tokyo Jiyu Gakuen to meet with the director, Hani Yoshikazu, and talked to him about the organization of the school. I learned that the school is a private girls' school and is completely independent of the Ministry of Education. Its purpose is: 1. Not to focus solely on knowledge; 2. To pay special attention to life; 3. To have students find life for themselves and gain experience in life; 4. Life is education, and the school is society. I had never heard of this new theory in Japan until now. I learned that the director is a Christian who believes in American-style education. All facilities are operated by the students themselves. Even the school's finances, budget, and accounts are left to the students. The female students are unusually lively and different from ordinary students. The school is located in the countryside, and the architecture is purely Western style. Every tree and plant feels lovely and natural. The beauty of the environment is definitely beyond the dreams of urban schools. Then, I was led by the students to visit the entire school. I learned that cleaning, accounting, social affairs, and paperwork are all controlled and managed by the students themselves. There are no workers in the school. Accommodation and other matters are considered the work that students should have and are never left to others. It can be said that this school is sufficient to represent the new style of education in Japan.</p>
<p>I have been inspecting education in Tokyo for more than ten days. My daily life can be roughly described as busy and strange. From 8 AM to 5 PM, I visit schools and educational institutions, running around, taking trains, cars, or trains endlessly. This is considered busy with visits. At night, I shop, visit friends, take notes, or organize printed materials. On Sundays and Saturday afternoons, I often go to the suburbs to hike, climb mountains and rivers, and visit famous attractions. This can also be said to be busy with tourism. In my busy schedule, I can still find time to compose music and watch dramas. I can laugh at myself for being in high spirits. As for what I have heard and seen, and the contact with food, clothing, and housing, I feel strange everywhere. Once I leave the country, there are strange things and anecdotes that are beyond my imagination. I will write another article to describe them in detail. Mr. Jin Lugin and I have agreed to leave Tokyo on the 31st to inspect Nagoya. Then, I will have a simple conclusion for Tokyo. In Tokyo, the schools, famous attractions, administrative agencies, and social enterprises all have some characteristics. The architectural equipment of primary schools, the military training of middle schools, the healthy and thrifty education of girls' schools, the specialization of universities, and the diligence of vocational schools and cram schools are the characteristics of school education. The absolute obedience of administrative agency personnel, the emphasis on seniority and experience, the development of social public undertakings, the stability of social order, and the serious service of the police are all its advantages. I once lost a handbag camera on the train. After telling the story, I was able to find the original item within three hours. The high level of society can be seen in general. The lack of research in primary schools and the continued emphasis on virtuous wife and good mother education in girls' schools are all its shortcomings. Among the primary schools in Tokyo that are more researched, the affiliated primary schools of Tokyo Higher Normal School and Women's Higher Normal School are the most prominent. The affiliated primary school of Toyoshima Normal School has the most substantial content. There are Jiyu Gakuen and Tamagawa Gakuen, etc., which have special educational propositions and can be effectively tested. The seeds of Tokyo's newest education in the future may be in these few experimental schools. Due to time constraints, I will make a detailed report on the overview of Tokyo education and the advantages and disadvantages of each school after returning to China to share with the readers. Today, I am packing my luggage and saying goodbye to my Chinese and Japanese friends in Tokyo. I will take the express train with Mr. Jin Lugin to Nagoya in the afternoon and then go to Kansai to inspect. As for the Japanese Sea and Air Exposition and the Family Exposition that I visited in Tokyo, the tour of Nikko, and the sightseeing of famous attractions in the city, I will write another article to describe them in detail. This concludes my life in Tokyo on the 15th, and whatever feelings it gives us, although the wise and the foolish have different views, all the stones from other mountains have their own considerable benefits.</p>
<p>I arrived in Nagoya on the morning of June 2nd. In the morning, I visited the Aichi Prefecture Education Department and the Nagoya City Government Education Section. I was visited by the inspector, who gave me various academic reports and various educational statistics. I inquired in detail about the educational administration organization and the schools under its jurisdiction. I learned that there are a total of 649 elementary schools in Aichi Prefecture, with 8,645 teachers and 353,581 students. The average salary of teachers is 50 to 75 yuan for elementary schools and 60 to 85 yuan for higher elementary schools. There are a total of 18 middle schools with approximately 20,000 students. The average monthly salary of teachers is 123 yuan. There are a total of three normal schools and 27 women's high schools. There are more than 30 vocational schools, divided into agriculture, industry, commerce, and women's vocational, and the industry sector has special schools for kiln industry, pottery industry, and crafts. The women's vocational sector is divided into special schools for sericulture, commerce, and crafts. The students of vocational schools are like the natives or apprentices of shops, aiming to obtain practical knowledge and skills. Therefore, their works are excellent, and graduates are welcomed by the business community. This point is the most difficult for vocational schools in our country to achieve. It can be seen that the education and occupation in Japan have a concrete combination. The progress of the social level can be imagined. In addition, there are also dozens of schools such as kindergartens, vocational training schools, specialized schools, and universities. The total amount of annual education funding is more than 17.5 million. There are a total of three municipal kindergartens and many private ones, but they must be supervised by the city. In the afternoon, the city government assigned an inspector and a car to visit various schools in the city, including three kindergartens, two elementary schools, and one vocational school. Each school has its own characteristics, which will be described in detail later.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ma Gulie Arrives in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Investigating Higher Education</p>
<p>Welcomed by All Sectors</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Mr. Ma Gulie, a Doctor of Literature from the University of Paris in France, was dispatched by the French Ministry of Education in March to come to China to investigate the status of Chinese higher education. Upon his entry into China via Shanghai, the Chinese Ministry of Education specially appointed Mr. Ding Zhaoqing, a Doctor of Literature who had studied at the University of Paris, as a joint investigation commissioner. They began their investigation in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, which lasted for more than two months before its completion. On the 5th of this month, they sailed east from Shanghai and arrived in Shenyang at 3:40 PM on the 8th. The Liaoning Education Department had previously received an order from the Ministry of Education, instructing Wu Jiaxiang to dispatch Xia Qingpu, the secretary of the department, along with Shen Zutong, the secretary dispatched by Wang Jinghuan, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Liaoning, to welcome the two doctors at the station. After the two doctors disembarked, they stayed at the Lingge Hotel. On the morning of the 9th, they separately visited Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the province, and Wang Jinghuan, the special commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the provincial government, they met with Wu Jiaxiang, the director of the Education Department, and Peng Jiqun, the director of the Construction Department. That evening, Wu Jiaxiang hosted a banquet at the Zhongxin Tang Restaurant, gathering young children from the Meiji Normal Elementary School Attached Kindergarten in Tokyo City.</p>
<p>Attendees included Liu Fengzhu, the vice president of Northeastern University; Feng Yong, the president of Feng Yong University; Gao Wenhan, the president of the Medical Vocational School; Wang Huayi, the president of the Provincial Education Association; Ji Jinsheng, Li Xianggeng, and Yang Mengzhou, secretaries of the Frontier Affairs Office; Jin Yufu, the secretary of the Provincial Government; and Peng Jiqun, the director of the Construction Department. At 2:00 PM on the 10th, the two doctors were invited by Zang Shiyi, the chairman of the province, to meet at the provincial government. Zang said that the education in the Northeast was progressing more slowly than in the South, but it had gradually come to life thanks to the promotion by Commander Zhang in recent years, although higher education was still as rare as morning stars. Dr. Ma was well-versed in Chinese literature and education, and he was invited to provide guidance. At 6:00 PM, Zhang Xueliang dispatched his secretaries, Shen Nengyi and Zou Xigu, to welcome the two doctors to the Beiling Villa for a meeting. Both parties conversed in Chinese. Zhang said that the hospitality for the doctors' visit to Shenyang was lacking and requested their understanding. Ding then explained the purpose of Dr. Ma's visit to China: (1) Chinese literature professors, (2) the academic performance of Chinese university students, and a detailed discussion on sending Northeastern students to study in France in the future. They talked for about fifteen minutes before Dr. Ma excused himself. As he was about to leave, Zhang asked if Dr. Ma had a fondness for Chinese antiques. Ma replied that he was very interested in studying them. Zhang said that he had several genuine works by Wang Xizhi and many other rare calligraphy, paintings, and cultural artifacts in his collection, and that he would invite them to talk again the next day. Ma and Ding then returned to their residence. The doctors' trip to China was specifically for investigating higher education. The Northeastern higher education institutions only included Northeastern University, Feng Yong University, the Medical Vocational School, and the Jiangwu Hall. The Education Department had already notified each institution separately, scheduling visits to Northeastern University's various colleges at 10:00 AM on the 11th. At the same time, the two doctors were invited to a banquet by Liu Fengzhu and would give a lecture at the university. The topic of the lecture was set as "Several Key Points in Modern European Research on Chinese Literature." It was said that the doctors would only stay in Shenyang for a week before going to Pingjin. Dr. Ma was proficient in Chinese studies and had served as a professor of Chinese literature at the University of Paris. He had a deep foundation in research. Ma told reporters that Chinese culture developed earliest, and Chinese literature, especially classical Chinese, was the most active form of writing, possessing great historical value and the true value of permanent preservation. In recent years, there has been a surge in the study of Chinese literature in Europe, especially in France. This time, he was dispatched to China with two purposes: (1) to promote Chinese culture, using the findings of the investigation as a reference to promote the boundless development of Chinese literature in France; (2) in recent years, the number of Chinese students sent to France has increased, but many students are unable to keep up with the curriculum or do not match the courses, preventing them from realizing their ambitions. After investigating in China, he would understand the situation of Chinese higher education and determine the appropriate level and subjects for future students going to France, avoiding wasting the youth's time. After arriving in China, he first investigated in the capital for six weeks, then in Shanghai for a month, and in Hangzhou for only two days, totaling over forty schools. He felt that scientific education in China had been developing rapidly in recent years, with Shanghai Jiaotong University and Nanjing Central University being particularly large in scale and well-equipped, while other schools each had their own special features. He planned to investigate in Shenyang for a week before going to Pingjin for a month, and then return to Shanghai before going back home. Ding Zhaoqing also said that he and Dr. Ma were classmates in France. This time, Dr. Ma came to China to investigate education, and Minister of Education Jiang Menglin, for the convenience of hospitality, appointed him to accompany Dr. Ma to various places. He intended to use the content and equipment of the schools visited by Dr. Ma to make a film, which would be widely publicized after returning to China. He had already asked the ministry for instructions on this matter. Furthermore, Peng Jiqun, Xu Shiying, Shen Zutong, and others, who were more than thirty of Dr. Ma's fellow Northeastern students in France, had scheduled a banquet at the Gongxin Tang Restaurant at 7:00 PM on the 13th, and had also invited French Consul Ge Libang, National Government Member Li Shizeng, and Education Magistrate Wu Jiaxiang to accompany them.

<h3>Curriculum Standards Issue</h3>
<p>Secondary School Curriculum to be Announced Uniformly Before August</p>
<p>University Curriculum Standards Committee Actively Preparing</p>
<p>In order to standardize the secondary school curriculum at all levels, Minister of Education Jiang Menglin instructed the Ordinary Education Department of the ministry to organize a secondary school curriculum standards drafting committee. Currently, the curriculum standards for junior high schools have been drafted and will be announced after review. The content of the senior high school curriculum standards is divided into teacher training, engineering, agriculture, home economics, physics, and education departments. Once the drafting is completed, it will be submitted to the review committee for examination. It is said that the standards must be announced uniformly before August so that secondary schools at all levels can follow the rules set by the standards.</p>
<p>The Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education believes that the courses taught in public and private universities in the country are inconsistent and must be unified to ensure that universities have something to follow. To unify the courses taught in each school, it is proposed to prepare a University Curriculum Standards Committee in the near future. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Sun Benwen, the director of the Higher Education Department of the ministry, and was received. The reporter asked about the recent preparations for the committee and its organizational standards. Sun kindly told the reporter the details, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Jiang specially instructed the Higher Education Department to prepare and organize a University Curriculum Standards Committee as soon as possible in order to unify the curriculum of public and private universities, bringing together various experts from across the country for joint discussion. Because the university curriculum is very complex, the preparation period is different from other meetings. Now, after discussion with the brothers (Sun refers to himself) and the personnel of our department, the approach has been roughly developed, divided into seven points: (1) The University Curriculum Standards Committee must gather various experts from across the country to ensure its completeness. (2) Under the committee, there will be three subcommittees: the General Committee, the Drafting Committee, and the Review Committee. (3) It is difficult to predict the essentials of the drafting method for each curriculum standard before the meeting. In general, it will aim to create specialized talents with the Three Principles of the People. (4) When drafting standards, it is necessary to divide them into departments and specializations to ensure thoroughness. For example, university agriculture, commerce, science, medicine, engineering, arts and sciences, and art departments should be divided into several specializations. To give a few examples, in the field of agriculture, there should be specializations such as agronomy, animal husbandry, soil fertilization, etc. In science, there should be specializations such as complex physics and chemistry, and simple chemistry. The same applies to other departments. (5) The distribution of experts: someone proficient in a certain subject or specialization will be invited to serve as a drafting committee member for that subject or specialization. (6) The committee is expected to be established in one or two weeks. (7) In addition to the talent selected and hired by the ministry, recruitment will also be advertised in newspapers.</p>
<p>Canadian University</p>
<h3>Continued Report on the Establishment of the Chinese College</h3>
<p>Recent Situation of President Jiang Kanghu Abroad</p>
<p>McGill University in Montreal, Canada, will establish a Chinese College this autumn and has hired Dr. Jiang Kanghu of China as the president and chief professor. This was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a more detailed account: Montreal is the largest city in Canada, with a population of 1.2 million, including 2-3 thousand overseas Chinese. The university is the highest institution of learning in Canada and also has the Gest Chinese Research Library, which is the second largest Chinese library in the New World with over 100,000 volumes (the largest is the Chinese book collection of the US Library of Congress in Washington DC, with 130,000 volumes). There are many manuscripts and secret editions. Dr. Jiang has been traveling abroad for three years. The US Library of Congress hired him as an advisor on Oriental Literature, with excellent compensation and plenty of leisure time. In addition to teaching his children, he also engaged in reading, lecturing, and translating. His translation of 300 Tang Poems has already been published, and his English lectures on Chinese culture have also been completed. Last summer vacation, the University of Oregon in the western United States hired him to lecture during the summer session. This time, he was hired by McGill University in Canada, not only making him the first Chinese to serve as the president and chief professor of a Canadian university, but also the first Chinese to serve as the president and chief professor of a European or American university. All previous Chinese professors at foreign universities were assistant professors, lecturers, or exchange professors. Moreover, this position at the Canadian university is a lifetime appointment, and the US Library of Congress still employs him as an honorary academic advisor, inviting him to serve three or four times a year, with travel and public expenses covered. Fortunately, Washington and Montreal, although in two countries, are only seventeen hours apart, with two daily trains running back and forth, which is very convenient. What is even more gratifying is that the Canadian university has a very long summer vacation, from the beginning of May to the end of September. If he is willing to pay the travel expenses, he can return to China for more than a hundred days each year. Canada has fast ships that go directly to Shanghai every half month, taking about half a month to reach. Dr. Jiang may be able to return once next year.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Pronunciation Symbols</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to have education personnel learn phonetic symbols, has specially issued a notice to provincial education departments and bureaus, as well as public and private universities, regarding the national standard phonetic symbols.</p>
<p>It has been instructed in the ministry's Order No. 483 that personnel of education institutions at all levels and teachers and students of all schools should actively promote and practice the phonetic symbols. Now, to facilitate learning, 20 copies of the national standard phonetic symbols are issued so that they can be copied for practice. Please check and use them. As for the consonants "万," "兀," and "广" in the table, which are temporarily listed, if they need to be deleted or corrected in the future, a further order will be issued after the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee discusses and decides. Please be informed of this order. National standard phonetic symbols (omitted).</p>
<p>National Government</p>
<h3>Approval of Three Important Cases of the Chinese Library Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Library Association previously submitted five important library cases resolved at its first annual meeting to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Education to review them and submit its opinions. The Executive Yuan forwarded them to the National Government for review and approval. Case 4, "Organizing a Central Archives to Organize the Archives of Past Governments for Reference in the Present," was deferred. Case 5, "Reducing Postage for Library Books," was within the scope of the Ministry of Communications and the Executive Yuan separately instructed that ministry to review it. The cases approved by the National Government as feasible are as follows: (1) "Case of Establishing Specialized Libraries." The Ministry of Education is currently planning the establishment of specialized libraries. The original proposal advocated that central ministries and departments should establish specialized libraries within their respective jurisdictions and open them appropriately, so that they can be used by employees for reference and also made available to the public, which is an excellent intention. Currently, some central and local party and government agencies have this equipment, but due to budget constraints, it has not been universal or because the location is small, it is inconvenient to open. Therefore, the effectiveness has not been significant. In the future, the central government and the National Government should separately order party and government agencies at all levels to first consider adding specialized libraries, and those that have already been established should also expand their capacity as much as possible, including the required expenses in the formal budget of the agency, and within the possible scope, allocate expenses to provide convenience for the public to read and refer to. (2) "Case of Distributing Publications of All Administrative Agencies to Libraries." The original case intended to promote government laws and regulations and political situation, which is essential. However, there are many public and private libraries in the country. It would be difficult to require all agencies to distribute all publications, which would greatly increase the printing costs of these agencies. This must also be weighed based on the financial situation and cannot be enforced by order. It is now proposed to revise the remedial measures: the National Government should order all agencies to offer special low-price preferential treatment for all publications issued to libraries. This will not cause difficulties for the agencies, and the libraries can add publications at a low price, which seems to be mutually beneficial and easy to implement. (3) "Case of Preventing the Flow of Ancient Books Out of the Country." In recent years, many ancient books and rare editions stored in the country have been lost. The reason is that foreigners transship them for export. Measures should be taken to prevent this. The Ministry of Education has always paid great attention to the preservation of ancient books and rare editions. Whenever such facts occur, it has repeatedly consulted various authorities, military and political organs, and the financial, transportation, and railway departments to strictly investigate. Another clear order to the above-mentioned relevant departments to instruct all ports and transportation agencies to strictly inspect and prohibit the export of transportation will naturally have a greater effect. The original case requested approval to proceed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Rectifies Secondary Education</h3>
<p>Issuing Investigation Forms with a Deadline for Completion</p>
<p>Instructing Private Schools to Expedite Registration</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department recently specially prepared and issued investigation forms in order to reorganize secondary education in the province. The department instructed the municipal and county governments to forward the forms for completion and set a deadline for handling the registration of private schools. The original order is as follows: In order to reorganize secondary education in the province, a municipal and county secondary school investigation form is specially prepared and issued. Please instruct the municipal and county governments to check and submit the forms to the department within ten days of receiving this document, without delay.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Regulations for Private Schools have long been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education. All private secondary schools within the jurisdiction of the respective counties and cities should comply with these regulations and submit their registration. Otherwise, the students and graduates of these schools will not receive the same treatment as students from registered schools. According to investigations, after the universities, both public and private, in all provinces and cities recruit new students in the future, they must no longer accept graduates from private secondary schools that are not public and have not been registered. The Ministry of Education has already issued a clear restriction. Registration of private schools is a matter of great importance. According to investigations, many private secondary schools in this province have already submitted their registration in accordance with the regulations, but many others have delayed their submission. Therefore, the deadline is set for the first semester of the 19th academic year for the aforementioned unregistered private schools to complete the registration procedures. If they still fail to complete the registration procedures after the deadline, they should be strictly banned or ordered to close down. Please also instruct all private secondary schools within your jurisdiction to be informed and avoid making mistakes. This order includes the following eight items in the investigation form: school name, school address, principal's name, date of establishment, student level, number of grades and students, amount of funding, and remarks. The instructions for filling out the form are: (1) This form must be filled out by all municipal and county private secondary schools. (2) The student level must clearly state the admission qualifications and length of study. (3) The number of grades and students must clearly state the number of existing student classes and the number of students in each class. (4) The amount of funding must state the source and nature of the funding in the remarks. (5) Secondary schools that are being prepared should also be filled in and noted in the remarks.</p>
<h3>Provincial People's Education Center Sets Up College Guidance Division</h3>
<p>The Promotion Department of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Center has established a college guidance division to guide college admissions. The charter is as follows: (1) This division is named the College Guidance Division of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Center. (2) The purpose of this division is to facilitate schools in guiding students in college admissions. (3) The scope of work of this division is limited to public and registered private secondary schools. The schools are limited to research on graduates from the aforementioned schools and secondary schools. (4) All matters related to secondary school and university admissions may be entrusted to this division for posting advertisements. (5) Students applying to schools can inquire about the general situation of each school, request a charter, and ask about application procedures from this division. The center will answer in detail to the best of its knowledge. (6) Schools entrusting admission matters should notify this division and submit the charter, general situation, and advertisements for posting. (7) For matters related to student admissions to colleges and schools, please contact this division or send letters to the College Guidance Division of the Promotion Department of the Education Center. (8) If the staff of this division is insufficient or the center is too busy, it may decline to provide supplies as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Zhang Naiyan Concurrently Director of Zhongda Experimental School</h3>
<p>The Zhongda Experimental School at Dashiqiao, Nanjing, is an experimental school of the Zhongda School of Education. Its funding is allocated by Zhongda, and the president of Zhongda concurrently serves as the principal. Under the principal, there are a director and a deputy director to manage the school's affairs. The director is concurrently held by Wei Que, the dean of the School of Education, and Wu Zengjie is hired as the deputy director. In practice, the principal and director only bear the title, and Wu is responsible for handling the daily educational affairs while residing at the school. It is learned that Wei Que has resigned from the position of director and will be replaced by Zhang Naiyan. Wu Zengjie has also resigned from the position of deputy director to the principal. It is rumored that Jin Yixian, the director of an affiliated elementary school of a certain middle school in Zhejiang Province, will be hired to succeed as the deputy director, but the teachers and staff of the school are currently trying to persuade Wu to stay.</p>

<h3>Counties Continue to Hold Second Session of Teacher Training</h3>
<p>The joint office for the preparation of compulsory education in various counties of Jiangsu Province decided to continue holding the second session of teacher training correspondence department in response to the needs of the counties to train unqualified teachers. The correspondence department recently sent a letter to the education bureaus of various counties, stating that as the first session of teacher training correspondence department is nearing completion, the counties have reported that the number of unqualified teachers in need of training is still large, and they have requested to continue the second session. There have been several cases of this. For the sake of seriousness, the office has widely solicited the opinions of the education bureaus of various counties to make a decision. According to the replies from the counties, more than fifty counties have agreed to continue, accounting for more than nine-tenths of the counties in the province. The office should actively prepare based on this need. Therefore, the original plan has been revised to make the curriculum and assignments more practical and meaningful, so that local elementary school teachers can have the opportunity to learn and grow, and also have further study and research. The difficulties of the shortage of unqualified teachers in various counties have been solved to a considerable extent. The training methods and application form for trainees are urgently attached, requesting your bureau to supervise the unqualified teachers to participate in the training and to send the list of trainees and training fees to the office before July 10 in order to start classes as soon as possible to emphasize education. The training period for this session is one year, with 1,000 places. All elementary school teachers who are not qualified or who have the legal qualifications but still want to improve can participate. The fee is 12 yuan per person. The curriculum overview is educational theory, educational administration and organization, materials and methods of research, basic subjects, and reference materials for each subject, which are divided into more than twenty items, which are not listed here.</p>

<h3>Japanese Observers Return to the Country One After Another</h3>
<p>Jin Guobao, former director of the Finance Bureau of the Nanjing Special Municipality, Wang Zhixin, president of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, and Hu Shuyi, principal of the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Women's Middle School Experimental Elementary School, went to Japan last month to observe Japanese finance, farmers' economy, and education, and have now returned to the country yesterday on the Nagasaki Maru. It is reported that Mr. Hu has also accepted an invitation from the Chinese Education Office of the Municipal Council and will give a speech at the Northern District Experimental School this afternoon on his impressions after observing Japanese education.</p>
<h3>Career Guidance Institute Focuses on College Admissions Guidance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Career Guidance Institute has compiled a college admissions guide to facilitate young people in choosing schools. In addition to detailing the truth about various universities, vocational schools, and secondary schools, and expert guidance, Cai Yuanpei, Dai Jitao, Zhu Jingnong, Hu Shuhua, and others have also inscribed words. It has been laid out and will be released soon. Yesterday, the institute also arranged to hold a meeting with experts from various elementary schools and junior high school education in the city to discuss the future of students. Eighteen people attended the meeting. Jiang and Yang, the directors of the Vocational Education Society, Pan Wen'an of the Career Guidance Institute, and Principal Zhao of the Zhonghua Vocational School reported and expressed their opinions on the Shanghai College Harmonica Team, which was established in the spring of this year and is instructed by Wang Qingxun. It has achieved excellent results and is the first women's harmonica team in China.</p>

<p>In addition to their opinions, the principals of various schools and elementary school education experts separately expressed the process of guiding college admissions and employment, and the effectiveness and expansion of students' future careers that should be emphasized in education. Most of them emphasized natural science and craft courses. Special attention should be paid to the personality, interests, and environment of children when they are admitted to school to avoid using what they have not learned and learning what is not used. In the guidance of women's careers, service to society and service to family should be considered equally. The Zhonghua Vocational School plans to set up more self-help scholarships and work-study programs in the next semester, and to set up a civil engineering department and a women's business department, hoping to prepare women in the vicinity who want to get employed early.</p>
<p>Yinxiang District Education Association</p>
<h3>Declares Support for the Recovery of Education Rights in Concessions</h3>
<p>The Yinxiang District Teachers' Union of this city passed a resolution at its general meeting yesterday, unanimously supporting the Shanghai Education Bureau's declaration to recover educational rights in concessions, as follows: There is no possibility of connection between concessions and education because concessions are in principle only allowed for foreigners to engage in business and reside. The local governance rights still belong to our country. However, the imperialists used their power to coerce and gain an inch, carrying out their aggression and seizing the educational rights in the concessions. Therefore, the education in the concessions is worthy of our attention. If we look at the current education in the concessions, it is truly heartbreaking. Only a few schools have been established. In fact, they are still vigorously promoting foreign culture to obliterate the national identity of the Chinese people. They are indifferent to our country's inherent culture and morality. Looking at the private schools that operate for profit, they are corrupt and indecent places that spring up like mushrooms. The concession authorities have not been heard to stop them. It can be seen that the Chinese people in the concessions not only do not receive adequate education, but also can be induced to degenerate. Education in the concessions has become so corrupt that it is unthinkable if it is not urgently recovered. The Shanghai Education Bureau, in view of this, advocated the recovery of educational rights in the concessions, which is a crucial plan for survival. The district is familiar with the situation in the concessions. The union has long been heartbroken and wholeheartedly supports the recovery of educational rights in the concessions. We are willing to be the backing of the authorities and will never give up until the goal is achieved. This is our declaration.</p>
<h3>This Session of the Global Association Recruits Schools</h3>

Furthermore, Mr. Zhou and other pioneers who studied in Japan, in view of the importance of Japanese, have borrowed the association's meeting place to create a Modern Japanese Summer Intensive Program, which will start on July 1 and last for seven weeks. Mr. Jiang and Mr. Wei, Japanese professors from the Modern Japanese author, Dobun Shoin, Guanghua University, and China Public School, have been invited to teach. All registration matters are also handled by the association.</p>

<h3>Cantonese Women Teachers' Triumphant Return</h3>
<p>Tennis Team Defeats Cheng Lie Three Matches to Zero</p>
<p>| Returned to Shanghai from Suzhou Yesterday |</p>
<p>The Guangdong Women's Teachers' Northern Expedition team came to Suzhou for a friendly competition on the heels of their Eastern Expedition victory. However, most schools were in the midst of major exams, so only Hui Ling and Cheng Lie were able to spare the time to compete. The results of the Hui Ling vs. Women's Teachers' match were reported yesterday. Yesterday morning at 8 AM, the Women's Teachers' team again competed against Cheng Lie Leyu Sports Research in tennis, playing two singles matches and one doubles match, with the Women's Teachers' team winning all three matches, a score of three to zero.</p>
<p>Singles (1): Women's Teachers' Huang Ruoqiu vs. Cheng Lie's Li Yunqin. Huang Ruoqiu's serves were powerful. Although Li Xueqin of Cheng Lie was well-trained, she struggled against a strong opponent. As a result, the Women's Teachers' team won two sets to zero, with scores of six to zero and six to zero. (2): Women's Teachers' Deng Zhihao vs. Cheng Lie's Qian Qinhua. The Women's Teachers' team also won two sets to zero, with scores of six to zero and six to zero.</p>
<p>Doubles: Since the Women's Teachers' team had already won both singles matches, it was not necessary to play this match. However, since the purpose of this competition was to foster friendship and not to focus on winning or losing, the match was still played. The Women's Teachers' team consisted of Huang Ruoqiu and Deng Zhihao, while Cheng Lie was represented by Li Xueqin and Qian Qinhua. The difference in strength between the two sides was so great that there was no exciting performance. On the Cheng Lie side, the main purpose was simply to observe. As a result, the Women's Teachers' team won two sets to zero, with scores of six to zero and six to one.</p>
<p>After the competition, the Women's Teachers' team immediately packed up and left Suzhou, taking the 12 PM train to Shanghai to transfer to Hangzhou for another competition.</p>

<h3>Why Do We Perform?</h3>
<p>By Gu Zhongyi on Shakespeare's Plays</p>
<p>There are two types of geniuses in the world: those with particularly developed imaginations and those with particularly developed intellects. Those with particularly developed imaginations are poets, who can conjure up a fairyland above the real world that ordinary people cannot see or guess. Those with particularly developed intellects are philosophers, who can use their keen eyes to find the mutual causes, the true meaning of life, and the truth of things in the chaotic and intricate real world. Throughout history, there have been many great poets and great philosophers, but it is not easy to find a genius who combines both imagination and intellect. Shakespeare is revered as the unparalleled genius of the world's literary scene and the leader of dramatic literature precisely because he is a great genius with equally developed imagination and intellect. He possesses a beautiful imagination that makes his plays as beautiful as a vivid flower, as harmonious as a wonderful song, and as tender as a delicate love poem. On the other hand, he has a profound intellect that makes his plays as solid as a rock, as deep as the sea, as accurate as scientific observation, and as sharp as a keen knife. His plays contain exquisite poetry, and his poetry contains profound drama. His prose is filled with poetic imagery, and his poetic verses reflect the true meaning of life. His characters emerge one by one, each with their own expressions, personalities, and styles. He grasps the complex world without missing a single detail, and he sees the complex human life clearly and explains it plainly. His layouts are meticulous, his structures are tight, and his interweaving is appropriate, truly seamless and natural.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" tells a story from Italy in English. From the 16th century to the present, the stage has changed countless times, and the trends and doctrines in drama have also changed countless times. However, Shakespeare continues to be performed in the world's great theaters, researched more each year, improved more each year, and advanced more each year. In addition, the recent new inventions in stage design and new lighting methods have made Shakespeare's plays even more magnificent and unparalleled on stage. The number of people who appreciate Shakespeare is growing day by day. Now, in Europe and America, Shakespeare's plays have become an important part of Western culture and education. In Europe and America, it is considered extremely shameful not to understand Shakespeare's plays.</p>
<p>We have heard of Shakespeare for decades. Some have read a few of his plays, some have read Charles and Mary Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare," and some have witnessed Shakespeare's plays performed in churches and schools. However, we have never seen a Shakespearean play performed on a real Chinese stage, in a serious and faithful manner, and spoken in Chinese.</p>
<p>We are a theatrical group that promotes art theater. We believe that starting with Shakespeare is a steady approach. We have great ambition to introduce the real Shakespeare to China. We dare not boast of success, but we only ask that you give us honest criticism after seeing our performance, so that we may know whether we have taken the wrong path. (The End)</p>
<p>The Pei Cheng Performance of</p>
<h3>The Young Mistress's Fan</h3>
<p>Pei Cheng Girls' School, a rising star in Shanghai, consecutively performed their masterpiece "The Young Mistress's Fan" at the Xia Ling Peck Cinema on the 16th and 17th. I thought it was a great opportunity not to be missed, so I invited a friend to the Xia Ling Peck. The lead actress, Ms. Chen Minde, is a talented and beautiful woman who is well-versed in new literature. Her every move is highly noble. In her role as Xu Shao-nainai (Young Mistress Xu), her appearance is beautiful, her demeanor is graceful, and her Mandarin is crisp and fluent. Her performance is truly impeccable. Ms. Miao Laifeng, in her role as Jin Nushi, in the scene where she advises Xu Shao-nainai, absolutely cannot reveal the unspeakable secret in her heart. Speaking frankly is like a mute eating Coptis chinensis - unable to voice the suffering. In addition, Xu Shao-nainai's misunderstanding is deep, and she cannot immediately heed the bitter words. Ms. Miao is able to fully express the love of a mother, not only moving Xu Chen Minde (photo taken by Chang Lie), the young mistress in the play, to change her mind, but also moving the audience outside the play. This scene is the most wonderful in the entire play, and Ms. Miao's successful performance has been recognized by connoisseurs. Ms. Wang Yezhu, in her role as Chen Taitai (Mrs. Chen), speaks sharply, like a quick scissor from Bingzhou. Her actions are lively and require a wealth of talent to perform. We often think that having a woman play a male role or a man play a female role will diminish the excitement, but the facts this time tell us that this is not necessarily the case. Ms. Shi Bingli's Liu Boying, dressed in a Western suit, is truly a handsome young man. The scene where he proposes to Xu Shao-nainai is strangely nauseating. Ms. Ding Yaozhen's Xu Ziming has a masculine air, but Ms. Ding's stature is too short, and compared to the tall and graceful Chen Minde, the couple (characters in the play) are inevitably short man and tall woman, a flaw in the perfection. The best makeup in the entire play goes to Ms. He Aizhu's Wu Ba-daren (Eighth Master Wu). His long gown, fan-waving, and beard-stroking gestures perfectly capture the spirit of an old man, making it almost impossible for the audience to believe that she is a young girl. As for the rest, Ms. Wang Yijian and Chen Xiuyun constantly call out "Mama," causing the audience to laugh. There are many other wonderful parts in the play, but I will not go into detail here. Finally, I would like to congratulate the students of Pei Cheng on their success. (Jian)</p>

<h3>Special Record of Ms. Guan Zilan's Solo Exhibition</h3>
<p>By Lu Mengshu</p>
<p>I don't understand painting, but I really like to look at other people's paintings. However, I don't like to look at landscape paintings made by people today or in ancient times. I don't need to say what I mean. I remember a few years ago, because of some opportunity and some task at work, I visited an old gentleman at his private residence. The old gentleman thought that because I was able to write, I must be able to appreciate paintings, so he showed me more than a dozen landscape paintings of various sizes, with clouds, trees, mist, and layered mountains, simple and unadorned, which were not lacking in a view. But I shook my head and said that these were just smudges of ink, not the art that I loved. The old gentleman was very angry when he heard this and scolded me for being a boorish man with vulgar ideas, unworthy of discussing elegance. I humbly apologized, saying that I only loved art, art with national spirit.</p>
<p>A month ago, Mr. Chen Baoyi sent me a letter saying that Ms. Guan Zilan would be holding a solo exhibition of oil paintings and invited me to visit and meet him there. Mr. Chen and I hadn't seen each other for a long time. Although we lived in the same city of Shanghai, it was as if we were separated by vast distances. Besides letters, we hadn't had the time to visit him at his studio for two years because we were on the same level but had gone our separate ways, each working hard on our own work, so there were very few opportunities to meet, almost as if we didn't know each other. However, Mr. Chen's enthusiasm was really touching. Although we couldn't meet often, he would at least write to me every few months to ask how I was doing. As for me, alas, I was very ashamed. Besides work, I also had to struggle for a living. The cross was getting heavier and heavier, and I had become indifferent to friendship. Speaking of it, I was really very sorry to my friends.</p>
<p>Regarding Ms. Guan Zilan's solo exhibition, since Mr. Chen had invited me in advance and Ms. Guan had also sent a special invitation card, although I had been feeling a bit abnormal lately and had a bit of a cold heart, I had to go to Ms. Guan's solo exhibition no matter what, because Ms. Guan was from Guangdong, and there were not many people from Guangdong who were working hard in art in Shanghai. Moreover, I had a particularly strong feeling for local color and always praised our own Guangdong people. Just like when I write novels, I often, unintentionally, use many Guangdong products that people don't understand. For example, in "Sister A-Chuan," there was the eating of wugui, which made elder brother Chuan Yan laugh out loud. Therefore, Ms. Guan's solo exhibition was a must-see, especially since there was someone waiting to meet me there.</p>
<p>Finally, there was an opportunity on a Sunday morning to go to the eighth floor of Hua An leisurely. But when I came out of the office building, I couldn't help but recall the sad days of the past, because the drizzle of rain and silk was just like the time when Zhenxia and I wandered aimlessly by the Tianfei Palace Bridge, like a pair of lost sheep. Now, Zhenxia has become an artist and a soldier carrying a gun and wearing armor. Having been accustomed to the oily and hot life in the city, he has changed and is eating coarse wheat buns that have been eroded by sweat, rain, blood, smoke, and flames. An artist with a national spirit will of course sometimes have such an action. As for me, my life has become more and more complicated, and I have been forced to suppress the wild cries of my soul against my will. The former memories are really infinitely nostalgic. When I arrived on the eighth floor of Hua An, I signed my name at the entrance and entered the exhibition room. Chen Baoyi's wife saw me at a glance and hurried to pull Mr. Chen over to introduce me. After shaking hands, Mrs. Chen congratulated me, and Mr. Chen apologized for a few words. Then he introduced me to Ms. Guan. I often met Ms. Guan, but we always passed each other as strangers because no one had ever introduced us and we had never shaken hands directly. This time, we bowed to each other and became friends, which was a first for me. However, the first impression was one that I had to talk about. She, Ms. Guan, was extremely graceful at this time. In her smile, silver stars seemed to be flowing in her changing eyes, telling people about the spirit of hard work in art over the years. There was an infinite amount of enthusiasm in her heart. Looking at her plump figure, she was just like the "Chinese peony" that the Japanese artist Kigen Nakagawa had described her as. I couldn't help but praise our Guangdong people once again.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lu, let's take a photo together," said Mr. Chen Baoyi.</p>
<p>At this time, they were busy taking pictures. Mr. Chen said this to me in a hurry. I accepted and went to look at the paintings, letting them arrange themselves in a corner to take the pictures. In the end, I couldn't escape Mrs. Chen's keen eyes. She called out, and Mr. Chen pulled me over. I stood behind Mr. Chen. While taking the picture, I thought to myself that I had lost so much weight these days and looked like a bamboo pole. I wondered if it would affect the whole group. But after thinking about it, I still took the picture.</p>
<p>After taking the picture, I saw my old colleague Mr. Du Shiheng. Mr. Du is a man with a strong national spirit. His writing is exceptionally strong, and he also understands painting. Naturally, this was to his liking. Soon, I also saw the two strong generals Bai E and Chen Qiucao. Then we went together to browse and appreciate Ms. Guan's paintings. On each painting, we had the same feeling as Kigen Nakagawa:</p>
<p>"No matter which of her works you look at, you can feel her most personal and intense fragrance from her bold brushstrokes and gorgeous use of color."</p>
<p>Indeed, Ms. Guan's works are straightforward and bold, but she not only expresses the strength of her personality but also represents the bright new spirit of our nation.</p>
<p>After finishing the viewing, Mr. Chen introduced me to Mr. Ye. I had met Mr. Ye at the New Asia Tea Party last year, but I didn't remember his name. Mr. Ye had just returned from Japan, so I asked him about the recent situation in the Japanese literary and art circles. He said that it was not as lively and enthusiastically high-pitched and changing its trend as in China because there are more gatherings in Japan and it is not monotonous. Also, Japanese artists are not as preoccupied with the anxieties of life as Chinese artists are, and they don't devote all their time to artistic work, so the two cannot be compared.</p>
<p>After finishing the conversation, Mr. Ye went to look at the paintings, and Mr. Chen and I went to another room to talk. Mr. Chen said:</p>
<p>"Ms. Guan's solo exhibition can be considered a success. Although there was not much publicity in the newspapers beforehand, a large number of people from the outside came to see it in the past two days, and our old friends such as Chuan Yan, Zhu Yingpeng, and Xu Weinan all came yesterday. Speaking of Ms. Guan's paintings, they can also be seen as successful. Her brushstrokes are very strong, which is something that ordinary people can see."</p>
<p>"Yes, her brushstrokes are bold and daring, completely unlike those of a woman. In the dull garden of art, this solo exhibition has really stirred up a tidal wave on the Huangpu River. It is not only a decoration for this year's art world, which is not lonely. I also hope that after Ms. Guan's solo exhibition, the next one will be your solo exhibition, my old friend."</p>
<p>"If I have good works, I would also be very willing to hold my own solo exhibition."</p>
<p>"You naturally have good works. It's just that you're too modest."</p>
<p>"How is the Xiyang Art Academy doing now?"</p>
<p>"The Xiyang school has stopped its activities, but the art group is still working hard because it is easier to achieve great success by focusing on one aspect rather than trying to do both, which would dilute the strength and make it difficult to achieve anything."</p>
<p>"Yes, you have really made a good change in this direction. Moreover, focusing on the art group makes it easier for people to see the results, and the effort is concentrated and not dissipated." Mr. Chen nodded in agreement. After we shared a cigarette, I said goodbye. On the way back, the fine rain was on my face and the cool wind was blowing on my clothes, making me feel desolate and nostalgic again. But Ms. Guan's person and paintings were deeply imprinted in my mind. After savoring it again, I couldn't help but praise:</p>
<p>"Our Chinese peony flower!"</p>
<h3>The Story of World Literature (168) by American Author John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 42: 19th Century Russian Literature</p>
<p>Several other living or recently deceased Russians are part of world literature, but how big a part, no one can yet decide. Kuprin, with his joyful nature, places him alongside Chekhov. The technique of his short stories and the novel "The Duel" is a wondrous talent known to English readers through satisfactory translations. Artzybasheff, his "Sanin," seems to me strangely unrealistic. Yet, he at least wrote a story about the failure of good people in an impossible, non-Christian world, "The Death of Ivan Ilyich". Korolenko is at least memorable for "The Murmur of the Forest," a book that is sentimental but is the finest description of the blind ever written by someone who could see. However, we cannot speak further about promising Russian writers of the present. In this limited field, not even France, England, Germany, and America combined can we see more than ten writers who will be remembered a century from today. Russia is an incomprehensible country. Over a century of its history, especially its political and economic life after the Great War, has troubled all economists west of Mongolia. At the time this book was published, the government seemed to be unsure whether to treat Russians as civilized people or as barbarians. Meanwhile, Russian literature, Russian music, Russian dance, and Russian theater conquered the world.</p>
<p>Chapter 43: Italian Literature After the Renaissance</p>
<p>May you live forever, easing our suffering, oh, dear sacred art,</p>
<p>Comfort of our unfortunate people, Leopardi.</p>
<p>In the golden age of Italian literature, Tasso was the last great genius. After him and his era, all Italian art declined until the 19th century, when a new Renaissance first appeared across Europe. There was no revival. The literature of the intervening 17th and 18th centuries was very prosperous in England and France, because these two countries, despite all their troubles, were politically and economically strong. What relationship exists between a country's prosperity and its art, or between an individual's prosperity and their creation, we cannot say for sure. However, physical health seems necessary for creativity to arise, and that creativity is what gives rise to art. For two hundred years, Italy was divided by civil war and defeated by foreign enemies. Those city republics, once considered powerful, had all become exhausted. The Italian spirit withered and tried to survive on past glories. Among all the imitators of Petrarch and the other masters of the Renaissance, not a single one produced ten lines of poetry.</p>
<p>However, that spirit did not entirely die. Before we come to the third rebirth of the nineteenth century, there are a few important figures that must be mentioned. In the twilight of the Renaissance, there were two or three talented figures, but none of them emitted the spark of true sacred fire. One was Guarini, whose Pastor Fido ("The Faithful Shepherd") inherited the technical Arcadian tradition and was read in the courts of Europe for two centuries, influencing the lovely literature of powdered, perfumed, silk-stockinged pastorals. A figure with sharper talents was Tassoni, who mocked the imitators of Petrarch, and whose satirical comedy Secchia Rapita ("The Stolen Bucket"), though long outdated, still has a certain ridiculous flavor. Tassoni is not suitable for us, but he is important enough to have guided the editorial work of Carducci, the great modern Italian poet. However, between Tasso and Alfieri, no pure poetry existed on that bright peninsula during those ages that seemed steeped in poetry.</p>
<p>The strength of the late Italian Renaissance lay in its prose, in the philosophers Bruno, Campanella, Galileo, and others. It is a pity that we cannot say more about the works of these great thinkers. However, they belong more to specialized philosophy than to general literary art. But who can say where the boundary between philosophy and literature lies? Bruno and Campanella wrote poetry, of course, but it has been forgotten. Their strength lies in their prose. Their ethical thought, long suppressed by the church authorities and by the neglect that leaves much of the most beautiful thought unknown and half-buried, has only in the last fifty years been recognized as one of the giants of philosophy. His main idea, that the entire universe is a living being, was a thought that was beautifully developed by the German philosopher Fechner several centuries later. Galileo is an extraordinarily talented scientist and writer. He is known to us, along with Copernicus, as the founder of modern astronomy. I am afraid that many readers, even Italians, do not know him as one of the giants of Italian prose. The collection of his papers and letters has only been done in the last forty years, and even then only in Italian. As far as I know, there is no English translation of the writings of this remarkable figure. The story of Italy's contributions to physics, medicine, electricity, and other sciences remains to be written. In that story, Galileo is the most outstanding figure, the most illustrious individual in the long direct line of Italian thought from the masters of Greece and Rome. Italy had preserved this legacy without blemish until recently, when her children began to go to German universities. They went to German universities and did not learn the power and depth of German thought, but learned its clumsy stupidity. An example of this is Croce, the most famous living Italian philosopher and critic, whose writing is so dense as to be almost unreadable.</p>
