<p>時評</p>
<h3>海軍會議已將絶望</h3>
<p>轟轟烈烈全世界一致盼望和平之海軍會議。至今日而破裂之象。愈益顯著。雖今日尙有形勢略好之消息。然觀各國間之種種糾紛。可决定該會議之前途。確已瀕於無望至該會最困難之點。據美報所述。（一）爲英美拒絶加入保安協定。故法國不能减低其必要之海防力。（二）日美間絶無妥洽之象（三）張國堅持與法國同等之主張（四）美日均反對三方面（美英日）協定。而據英報所述。則有互相牽連之關係。意國堅開列海防必需之噸位確數。因法國之海軍力將視意爲進退意旣不開噸位確數。法遂不允變更其備忘錄内所開之數目而英美兩國海軍力之最小限度又大半視法爲轉移。日本則以美國爲其標準仍堅持七成之要求而不肯稍變。</p>
<p>此次海會最大之障礙。大抵不外乎是而其癥結。則仍在互相猜疑互相防範。而未能以眞誠相見。夫世界各國鑒於歐戰之慘酪。倡和平而謀所以弭兵者。幾將十年矣。第一次之華盛頓軍縮會議。第二次之日内瓦軍縮會議。均未有若何效果。故開第三次之倫敦海軍會議。各國屬望和平之心愈切。當其動議時。雖亦有料其必無結果者。然以一般國民盼望之殷對於英首相赴美聯合發表召開海會之宣言歡迎何等熱烈乃不謂至於今日。仍不免黯淡無華。華令人失望者。其果和平之不能實現歟。抑以戰爭之苦痛未甚。和平尙不甚寳愛必須待之異日歟。竊謂以今日世界情勢論。金融如是之緊。失業如是之多。工商貿易之途如是之艱難使此海軍會議而竟完全絶望者。則不必其眞有二次大戰之實現即此各國擴張軍備力謀自固之費用。已足隐世界人民於困境矣蓋會議旣不成功則必互相猜疑防範之心愈甚。軍備旣無限制。則必各按照其預定之計劃。競爭造艦。（據報載一艦之建造費給養費其數已可驚駭）以擴張海軍力爲未足則進而擴張陸軍。又進而擴張航空。又進而擴張一切軍械軍需之設備試觀近年來各國之預算。軍費均已占大部分。且皆有增無减倘若再謀擴充則勢必增加預算。更重人民負擔。在此民生凋敝之世界。其將何以堪之也。故此世界之禍福利害。全繫於此千鈞一髮之會議。苟無結果即仍能維持和平而已隠受不和平之實。吾人故終盼其尙有一線轉機之望也。</p>

<h3>全市運動會之第二日</h3>
<p>田徑賽已結束成績可觀大有希望</p>
<p>王季淮第一逯明陳虚舟成績甚佳</p>
<p>六星獲女籃球錦標今日均係球賽</p>
<p>昨爲上海特别市全市運動會開會之第二日天氣晴朗觀衆熱閙、大多數項目、田徑賽皆屬决賽精彩較多第一日爲多、其他有籃球網紀其盛况如下</p>
<h3>會塲熱鬧</h3>
<p>觀衆增多高坐看台上之觀衆、較之昨日增加五倍有餘統計當在二萬人左右、中以市立男女學校爲多、遇長程賽跑、常鼓噪以助賽員之精神亦可見其興味之濃矣</p>
<p>會塲秩序第一日秩序之不甚佳、由於未經點名人塲之運動員隨意羼人跑圈之内竚觀他人比賽成績、或扶掖其他運動員昨爲免除該項弊病起見主持會塲秩序之光華童子軍敎練戴企留特將各項運動員號數分别抄出、一開始、即從嚴制止賽員隨意進塲秩序頓佳然爲時未久而攝影員三三兩兩佈滿全塲、又經童子軍一再勸令出塲、嚴整之秩序依然恢復　　裁判員忙此次運動會之裁判員、雖早經技術部請定但一部份人臨時因事不克蒞塲人手未免缺少、而總裁判又因經濟時間起見將田徑賽同時舉行、致每裁判員須兼任數職奔東奔西異常忙碌然以此得如期竣事、結果圓滿堪稱勞苦功高</p>
<p>塲地合用昨日天氣續晴、塲地較前日乾燥沙坑前奔跑之路再加滾壓更爲堅實合用故賽員上塲多能得心應手、惟西風過勁前日舖灑之木屑時時飛揚、中目軱迷、亦美中不足之事、</p>

<h3>田徑槪評</h3>
<p>田徑賽業於昨日舉行完畢觀二日之成績、擲鐵球與一萬米賽跑、成績甚佳、八百米與一百米亦稱不弱五項運動第一王季淮、成績頗佳、十項亦可觀女子成績雖不優良、然能出塲比賽、有尚武精神、殊堪讚許、總觀全部成績、頗爲平均、雖天氣未暖、連日天雨、未有充分之練習、而成績已可觀、倘再加旬日之細心訓練出席全國運動會、大可與遼寗運動員一較身手、首席如不能獲得亞軍可操左券、願我男女運動員勉之、茲將高君之批評錄下、</p>
<p>百米决賽發脚陳寳球最捷、然論格勢步調、自以鍾連基爲最佳、步步進迫、達五十米時已與陳君並駕齊驅、入後速度更增、遂以第一人抵終點老將臨塲、的是不凡、</p>
<p>女子五十米劉靜芳預賽複賽、成績特佳、有鶴立鷄羣之意、奈昨日决賽、發脚過遲、比衆落後有二步之多、能扶搖直上、於極短距離中、趕到第二名、亦不大易矣、</p>
<p>王健吾爲四百米中之老將十年前在江蘇省運動會中造有獨特之成績、現雖服務電公司、仍不廢運動、於滬上民衆運動會中、時露頭角、昨日四百米决賽、出發至五十米、王君即居前領導羣衆、入後再接再厲、並無半點髮懈、觀心衆目中、早皆以第一人許之、敦料變生倉卒、至最後十米間竟爲蘇祖卿衝出、不幸殊甚、然蘇君亦勇矣哉、</p>
<p>高欄决賽之一刹那間李靖邦與曹裕、競爭極烈、成績之差亦在幾微之間、第四欄前、李居前曹隨後、緊跟不放、至第八欄、曹竟一踴而爲前接、此時李君當然十分努力、以决最後之雌雄、至越末一欄時、兩人同時起跳、同時落地不差毫厘、但在十五米之衝跑中、曹君以兼賽十項運動耗力已多、相形見拙落後半步、屈居第二、　　女子棒球擲遠樊瑞梅方法旣合、實力又充、連擲六次均在七十米以外、觀者莫不爲之昨舌、賽畢、有某裁判員握球試擲一次、亦愧勿如、</p>
<p>各項比賽中、最能博行得觀衆烈之興趣者、當推一萬米决賽、一大串健兒奮勇奔跑繞塲二十五圈、的是奇觀益以其中之孫琴伙君、滑稽突梯、每週經過看台、必改換一種奇特之姿勢、或又腰或伸臂、或輕躍若舞或直馳若　觀者見之皆笑不可仰、長跑名手陳虚舟脚步輕健、永第先導同濟校戰員董家夑舉步亦極自然在作三圈後、不慌不忙、常列第二、至末圈忽爲周斌追出、蓋周蓄實力於後也、</p>
<h3>昨籃球結果</h3>
<p>女子籃球賽六星榮膺冠軍選</p>
<p>—昨以二十二比十五勝東南—</p>
<p>前日戰兩江作棄權</p>
<p>六星以二比○勝</p>
<p>六星女子籃球隊對東南女體校籃球隊、昨日下午五時起賽於中華籃球房、六星球藝已非昔日、東南則即一度蜚聲遐邇之强南隊實力均極雄厚、爭戰亦極猛烈、結果六星以極佳之表演、克服東南、奪得本届全市運動會錦標、榮膺冠軍、深可喜也、結果二十二比十五、裁判員宋君復、</p>
<h3>兩江棄權</h3>
<p>前日兩江與六星之戰、結果兩江獲勝、但兩江球員席均、去年曾任城東女學體育敎員、資格不合、昨日上午十時經大會派員向該校查問屬實、席女士在該校除任國畫班之早操外、並担任其餘各班體操音樂各一小時、故該次結果、兩江應作棄權六星以一二比○勝、</p>
<h3>六星可畏</h3>
<p>昨晚六星表演之佳、得未曾有、蓋有戰線已略更易、陳新元、調中鋒、朱民寳替盧瑤位、以梁麗芳南後衛雖强、竟何如之何、三前中鋒以陳新元最佳、陳英瑞最捷、朱民寳尙差强人意苟能早以此陳線敵兩江、或早即克服之、何待於兩江棄權也三後衛中除梁妹妹稍弱外、葉福基余啟英何待贅言也、</p>
<h3>東南减色</h3>
<p>東南自得中華會錦標後、在西靑賽初開時、尙有二幕美妙表演外、以後似未有可觀之比賽、棄權於西靑後、聲勢威望、爲之大挫故六星抱必勝之心來、交鋒之後即見非其敵手、相差遠甚攻旣不得、守亦殊艱、前鋒之中、敦筱萍孤掌難支大厦、後衛除蔣懷萱外、殊難加一讚詞、自始至終屈居六星陣下而已、</p>
<p>「自右至左」（上）鐵球第一逯明、標槍第一王季淮高欄第一李靖邦、</p>
<p>（中）一萬米第一陳虚舟第二周斌、第三董家夑第四余愚、</p>
<p>（下）低欄第一吳祖憲、跳遠第一郝春德、跳高第一李林　（王　攝）</p>
<h3>六星風頭</h3>
<p>下令互攻、只見六星勢不可當陳英瑞首先犯進一分、再進一球、二比○先聲奪人、郭筱萍雖還致一球然陳英瑞朱民寳又屢建奇功、乃以八比二勝第一節、繼而東南雖得機反攻、六星仍以十三比七遙居前列、東南陣地幾爲六星盤旋之塲、上半時六星以十一比七勝、</p>
<h3>東南失敗</h3>
<p>檸檬再戰、陳英瑞退出休息以盧金瑤進、聲勢仍繼續不衰、東南後衛成强努之末、陳新元大顯威風、第三二節結果十八比十一、六星遠遠進前、最後鏖東南毫無起色、而六星則陳英瑞再入戰塲東南遂一敗不能再起矣、結果二十二比十五、</p>
<h3>男子籃球複賽</h3>
<p>東西靑光得决賽權</p>
<p>東西勝同濟：卅三比念五</p>
<p>靑光勝持志：三十比念六</p>
<p>籃球昨晚舉行複賽、共二組、六時起交鋒於中華籃球房、結果東西勝同濟、卅三比念五、靑光克持志三十比念六、東西靑光遂得最後之决賽權、二組猛戰情形、記之如下、</p>
<h3>東西反敗爲勝</h3>
<p>東西對同濟、在最初意料、必爲一面倒之比賽</p>
<p>陳充前鋒、陸鍾恩亦坐而休息、兩軍相遇、同濟竟勢如破竹、自孟繼賢以侯之犯罰、首得一分、繼而續續增加、實至同濟十四分、東西尙未開紀錄、陸乃入、勢仍佳、東西一試不再試、球終不入籃、同濟以十八比七大勝上半時、至此黄運利、</p>
<p>梁國權乃不得不入、以極佳之傳遞、陳祥龍頻频連中、賽五分即成平手、同濟則一蹶不起、東西遂反敗爲勝、幸哉、結果三十三比念五、裁判員徐振東、</p>
<h3>靑光得决賽權</h3>
<p>靑光與持志之戰、極爲緊張、二隊分數每相差在一二分之間、靑光雖厲害持志亦非弱者、不能即斷勝負也持志曾光榮榮記錄首開、及至上半時終結、成十四比九、檸檬再戰、持志雖極力追上、無奈力不從心、靑光後衛孔廣益、遠射屢中、持志於是始終以三四分落後、結果三十比二十六、靑光勝、裁判員、張國助、</p>
<h3>昨網球結果</h3>
<p>昨日網球單打、均爲男子、</p>
<p>沈美珍　勝　何聲應　九比七　七比五吳少病　勝　郭競武　六比二　六比一梁　顯　勝　沈柏貴　六比二　一比六六比三鄭兆佳　勝　陳國珵　六比二　九比七余田光　勝　尹鴻生　六比一　六比四郁秉權　勝　邱正偷　（邱未到作棄權）</p>

<h3>異軍突起之飛星隊</h3>
<p>本埠愛國女學辦理成績、早蜚聲海上、其文科體育科、從已往歷史上看來、文科學生是集大江南北閨中之秀、好在文壇上稱雄、而體育科學生則多活潑分子、每於武塲角逐、但此次參加全市運動會、則聞扛破前例、所謂異軍突起之飛星隊者、其組織由文科體育科混合而成、著湖風之虞作家亦參加其中、此隊精神、聞極美滿、蓋於雄糾糾之中、還含有英秀而文之才、彼隊主意、完全爲發揮天才而决戰、故本市雖有老練强敵在前、而亦毅然加入、現在已定今日下午與民立隊决賽、人家還未知飛星之從何飛來、故特爲述其略史、以飛星隊之由來云、</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>主人——我　了好一會的鈴了。你怎麽老是不來。　　僕人——主人。我剛從樓梯上跌了下來。</p>
<p>主人——那麽你旣省了脚步。應當格外來得快了。怎麽反而遲來呢。</p>
<p>客—你們公司中誰是負責的人。侍者——誰是負責的人。我不知道我是時常受責的。</p>

<h3>京華片片</h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>首都自公共汽車停駛以來。迄今數月未聞有開行之消息。諒以營業欠佳而揩油者多。惟下關至城。相距十餘里之遙。雖有小火車馬車汽車與人力車。然以上各項。中等社會之人。多不樂就。蓋不若公共汽車之價廉而迅速也。故自停駛以來。一般人咸苦之。而馬車與人力車。則莫不利市倍蓰。然熟諳道路而老於京行者。仍就乘於汽車。且與公共汽車之値相等。不過此汽車非「公共」而爲「野鷄」者矣。</p>
<p>一載以來。電影事業。如雨後之春筍。若國民。世界。南京。新光。大同。中央等等。營業最佳者。爲國民。因其地點及座位均占優勢。如世界。大同。南京。所映亦多名片。惟前曾映「萬王之王」與「十誡」及「賓漢」。雖當時均賺錢不少。而事後大遭反感。且當局於是下禁演「萬王之王」之令。近復有電影審查局之組織矣。</p>
<p>都中道路。除中山大道以外。均不見佳。入春以來。天雨連綿。泥濘難行。而尤以汽車經過。狂飛黑花。雖避之丈餘之外。猶能波及衣履。狹路相逢。徒喚奈何而已。中山道因車馬行駛過衆。載重太甚。亦間有剥蝕之處矣。</p>
<p>首都生活程度雖日益增高。而糧食本尙較廉。惟今春因天雨關係。逐漸漲値。現普通之米。每擔亦須十五元之譜。於是各機關之伙食增價。或飯菜遜色不可口。至平民則叫苦連天矣。</p>
<p>城中旅館最著者。向爲安樂酒店等等。近自中央飯店開幕後。規模更形宏大。入晚電炬高燭。遠處瞭見。爲首都商業上之點綴。可稱生色不少。現花牌樓附近門帘橋。又有世界飯店之開設。正在大興土木。將來必有一番更熱鬧之競爭也。</p>
<h3>定里觀梅記</h3>
<p>— 聽永生</p>
<p>人第知杭州之梅花。必數孤山靈峯。而未知臨平西去之超山。縱知超山之梅。然亦必數報恩寺之大明堂。以宋梅一株爲奇特。而未知馬鞍山南。有邨落曰定里者。益有可觀者焉。今年春。中應𥂝僧石瓢。來函約遊超山。謂卅里瓊花。粲粲如雪。香風一動。清沁肺腑。是不可以項背失之。於是心怦然動。要鄧糞翁王綸父唐僊同行。盡七小時。而鐵車運我輩發自上海。及晚宿大圓寺。翌晨大霧。諸山日</p>
<p>皆睡。於朦朧隠約之間。日出暈雲。野鳥時鳴。結伴行於山腹漫霧之中。遠香已逐東風而至。從者擔酒一罎。皿五具。肴選斑鳩野鴨牛脯落花生之屬。沿途供飲。已而千樹萬樹。已掛銅鉦。山霧漸開。人影亂地。而澹煙瘦玉。靜撲寒香。亦次第入眼。且錢别韻。短籬疏　之間。一枝兩枝。横斜於夾路。障我帽簷。遂亦低首過之。讀了公「人對水仙猶崛强。見君那敢不低頭」句。軱爲之神往。行之里許。經白馬坑席地而飲。奠盃酒於梅花樹下。至定里。一路椏枝歷亂。繁英縱横。眼底流光。未輸鹽絮。到此冷香孤艶之邨。自疑身不棧於轗軻飄蕭之境。其移情刹苦之力。有甚於醺酒十萬鍾者。白日漸高。位就於鈞。遂相約不行。取蒲團。趺坐萬花叢裏。蜂笛有無。林風入酒。屏息靜味。不知依夕。</p>
<h3>海外梅訊</h3>

<p>十五日上午。訪華僑日報館梁仲衡。君熱心愛國。言詞悽愴。云南人尙有保護者。因有主人可依靠。我華人何倚乎。君等行於途。假若有人襲擊。向何處求保障乎。中國革命多年。華僑捐欵若干萬。至今不能與法人交涉設一領事。外交失敗如此。日事内爭。任華僑爲人奴隸。無過問也。鳴呼哀哉。余悲其言。下午訪羣某氏。以例兩點以前須將報稿呈警署檢閲。方許上版。故未得見之。要之報界對中國内戰不息。均甚不滿意也。</p>
<p>羣報陳君。談華僑狀况。謂安南共有三十萬人。西貢现兩萬。堤岸有十萬。堤岸爲唐人埠。南北大街名廣東街。華僑財産。以打米出口爲大宗。名爲米。而貲本常數百萬。銷行太平洋各口岸。上海廣東均食其米。所謂安南米。至各帮共分五帮。爲廣肇帮。潮州帮。福建帮。客帮等。人數粤七閩三。而財富閩爲優。自治團爲總商會學校凡五六家。如德城中法等校。爲中學程度。而他人云此間對於高等學校。頗有限制智識之意。蓋不易辦成。或亦此地程度本無高級智識可言歟。據女校長言。女校共三四處。但舊式書塾。遍地皆是。猶之沿用陰歷矣。</p>
<p>十六日禮拜。在振華女校。有安南國民黨總支部監察委員黄祺庭永隆省校長馮銘芬來談。述及余之對世界坤化大同聯邦學說。報界應公開傳播。關係人類和平之福音。即法政府亦無異議。余云。余已印有法文譯本綱要。惜寄新加坡。該譯本經上海老法文家沈仲俊校印。滬法領事曾見之。大爲驚喜。謂吾西方發明甚多。獨對戰爭避免方法未想到。讓你東方發明了。仍要原書擇譯成法文云。余又曾與上海法文日報經理談一時。亦表示得此新聞。至爲欣幸。蓋法人愛自由。果有良法。彼將歡迎。今世界相殺。要亦苦無出脫之良法故耳。並非人與人果有仇恨也。其法俟大衆共商之。</p>
<h3>安哥拉述事詩七十韵</h3>
<p>— 程演生作於土耳其新京（十八年十二月）</p>
<p>泱泱土耳其。地阻東西陸。開國七百載七百載。傳世三十六。（土自鄂斯曼大帝建國共傳三十六世於西歷一九二二年亡）風雲極合沓。威靈率羣族。大帝鄂斯曼。雄圖膺得福。皇室忽中衰。刑政失鈞軸。未造遂陵夷。竟爲强者鹿。空前歐戰起。國勢益逼蹙。屬土盡瓜分。藩籬任剪扑。希臘逞夙怨。耀兵更深蹴。英人逐其後。危機誠難卜。（一九一九希土戰起英人實主之）</p>
<p>人心未盡死。三户秦可覆。豪傑奮然起。一戰舊業復。（現土總統凱未爾起兵東部小亞細亞最後西希兵戰於安哥拉附近大勝希兵遂退大敵破當前。餘寇悉竄伏。坐據古名都。（一九二○安哥拉政府成立國民議凱未爾爲議長）指揮開心腹。維時信難虞。瘡痍嗟滿目。慘澹羅羣英。經緯仗成竹。幾日振宿旅。幾日檢民牧。幾日頌國是。幾日驅宗祝。宣布共和驅逐蘇丹敎主。眞乃大力者。手能迴川谷。焂然全局定。仰觀天色肅。</p>
<p>内網旣已理。外交匪易决。列强會落桑。（一九二二歐洲開洛桑會議解决東方問題）端賴撙俎折。鄭僑膚使選。曹　壇坫列。（土代表爲現内閣總理伊土美將軍。）國權安可喪。國恥終須雪。晉楚猶思侵。盟書幾再裂。（大會不允土代表之要求談判遂中斷至明年復開會掎抺直不撓。條約平等結。泣涕收故京。民氣從茲活。（一九二三年十月土耳其兵重入君土坦丁堡民皆泣涕歡迎之）努力躋大邦。改革邁先烈。</p>
<p>遠客萬里來。輶軒藉聞見。前途承休明。觀光自忻忭。行李値淸冬。䟦涉未云倦。朝發黑海湄。夕抵壯幾縣。（安哥拉）寓館憩夐樓。驅車臨廣甸。豁然城市繁。控制疆界險。表裏扼窮巖。關塞掣飛電。形勝絶西亞。襟帶三洲便。（安哥拉四圍皆山形勝險峻可控制歐非亞三洲之要衝）定覇勢心爭。邀功力可援。（希臘波斯羅馬塞耳帶阿拉伯皆嘗據此地）不見古戰場。壁壘仰空旋。郊垌飲馬窟。時矚水盈淀。蒼籐冒松林。鷹隼翔雲睠。（史載羅馬大師龐與安息王彌德答底蒙古帖木兒與土蘇丹拍雅繼德皆弄兵於此）不見古帝宮。崇基陰嶺擅。異代悲寂寞。想像覲像纓并。（史載馬其頓王亞力山大曾兩次朝會各國君臣於此都岩上遺宮故址猶存）華表遇千載。頽垣存廢殿。（羅馬奥古斯大帝之圓柱及其生廟猶在）刻畫王會圖。寒　照石片。（廟側堆置古碑甚夥皆刻畫希臘羅馬波斯等世朝會騎獵故事惜不能墨拓之）　　古人悵已去。今維新邦奠。文物規泰西。衣冠朝野變。（改革文字廢止紅冠）軌轍策交通。井市力修繕。三事何葳　。六府殊蔥倩。（安哥拉興市政關新區凡關於居民之建設如電燈煤氣自來水無不備置其總統府國務院議院各部署皆新造而植樹甚茂）苑囿茂霜花。（公園雖入冬而秋花尙有存者）痒序盛講讌。銅像鑄大勳。奕奕風生面。（新市口有凱末爾將軍銅像氣象雄俊）官道平如砥。華屋參差徧。環肆饒晶鹽。錦氈觸目炫鮮果推金檬。素絲展美絹。（皆土之出産）熙熙從法治。公私洽朋彦。十載可大成。富庶期同蔫。</p>
<p>我懷難具陳。我意良企羨。于役不久留。因風來餘譔。回首緬故土。歷歷中情轉。鼎革有廿載。南北仍塗炭。忍操同室戈。莫解倒懸患。慷慨泣且歌。禹域何時宴。　　共稱兩病夫。一夫病已釋。明効奏刀圭。由來良醫擇。（歐人稱土耳其與中國爲東亞兩病夫）横披赤縣圖。黯淡山河色。安得凱將軍。（指凱末爾）仗節禦寇賊。賴爾濟顧危。賴爾興邦國。</p>
<p>漢唐蹟已堙。宋明困積習。羣倫歏久衰。匹夫應有責。黄帝垂天鑒。子孫或不忒。　　中山　　恢宏有典則。</p>

<h3>美棉田有减少訊</h3>
<p>紐約十三日電告美棉狀況云、同業限價購進者較金多、實在原棉需求略旺、出口與銷費統皆利於缺方、私有人消息謂棉田稍减、國内疋頭貿易遲滯、左右棉市之主力爲農務局之意思、</p>
<h3>美總統提議撥欵爲農獎勵金</h3>
<p>總額一億元美金</p>
<p>業經上議院可决</p>
<p>華盛頓十二日電、美國對於農産物市價之維持、經聯帮農務局研求種種策略、尙無良好影響、棉花小麥依然低廉、胡佛總統提出一萬萬美金之農事獎勵金案於上院、業經上院可决云、</p>
<h3>糧食麥市期現同小</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、因洋麥又小、各月份開價均稍疲滯、不過近遠期之抛售者、未見湧暢、多頭終遇廉拾進、遠期更以爲日尙遠、天氣雖佳、尙不能過分衝動、因此上落甚微、如以往年之慣例言、將來新麥行情、終有軟落之機會也、結果本月份較前日小二分、四月份小一分、七月份小一分、餘無土落、現麥交易尙暢、價稍平落、如後步標準不佳、恐尙須帶一些、開宿州麥五兩一錢六分、淸江浦麥五兩一錢半、揚州麥五兩零四分、紹興麥五兩一錢二分至五兩江西麥五兩零二分、次至四兩八錢、高郵麥五兩一錢二分至零四五分、共開四千五百包、由阜豐等廠辦去去云、</p>
<h3>粉市疲滯之主因</h3>
<p>洋麥報價續小</p>
<p>津帮回出期貨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下開盤後各月份又趨疲滯之局、因洋麥報價仍小、人心不振、至北銷方面、上午營口帮曾有一萬餘包買進、故本月份尙見定面惟至下午各盤、津帮雖以現貨已有購好、故對於期貨稍有回出因此各月份開價、較上午稍又疲軟、遠期各月份亦以天時晴暖、人心亦稍軟落、觀此後局面、因國外終有剩之象、本埠粉市、當在盤旋之中也、結果本月份較前日小七厘半、四月份小五厘、五月份不動、六月份好二厘半、七月份小五厘、八月份小五厘云、</p>
<h3>洋米反漲二角</h3>
<p>期米漲一錢左右</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况又見變化、因新到三船後、忽爲江北與内地本街等暢辦、市價立跳二角、期米、到少銷多、不數支配、因此期米跟踵而漲、遠期米亦爲内地帮注意、乃與近期　同漲每担一錢左右、計開出一二號西貢六千包、價十四元至十三元九角三分、又一號四千包價十四元六角至四角、茄佛米尙係初次到埠、　　上中次米缺乏、乃開出五千包、價十三元三角半、期米開西貢萬餘包、一號路貨十四元二角八分、二號十三元七角半、小絞三萬包、路貨十三元六角三分、三四月份六兩零八分至零五分、大絞路貨二千包、價十二元九角半、</p>
<p>日來洋米市况、時有變化、凡在路貨將未到之前、市價每見不疲、一至新貨抵埠、價反激漲激漲之故、蓋爲貨到後各帮爭辦故也、</p>
<h3>兩閘北貨蜜棗市勢江河日下</h3>
<p>蜜棗春初曾售秃秃二十六七兩迨後即見疲跌、邇來愈甚、蓋天氣漸暖、此種糖　菓品有變更質地之虞、値此走塲呆滯、不得不趨疲跌之一　也、昨市頂上徵微工秃秃、行售不上二十兩、上下檔照加、蘭谿貨更覺疲軟、有一蹶不振之槪、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵走銷暢旺</h3>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Yinwu declared to the various bureau chiefs: "My arrival in Taiyuan at this time is bound to lead to various speculations from the outside world. My mission to Shanxi is very clear. Mr. Lü Baichuan advocates stopping the chaos rather than suppressing it. If his advocacy cannot be achieved, he will never start chaos for personal reasons. Therefore, he is determined to resign and go abroad to rest. Most of the military and political affairs he has handled over the years have been handled by himself, and others rarely get involved. Before leaving, he must negotiate with the responsible persons of various departments, so he summoned the military and political chiefs of various places to Taiyuan. I only stayed in Taiyuan for one and a half days, and briefly discussed the aftermath with Yan. As for the duties of colleagues, from the perspective of the central government, it is the central government that appoints administrative officials; from the perspective of the local government, we are public servants, and we can rest assured to do our duties, regardless of anything else. We can't control Mr. Yan's personal departure, so I report to the public to clarify the truth," and so on. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting Reports to the Central Political Council</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Japanese Newspapers' Views</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, it will be reported to the Central Political Council and the National Government by Foreign Minister Wang for approval. The Central Political Council may submit it to the meeting next Wednesday, and it can only be formally approved after being sent to the Legislative Yuan for review as usual. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, all major Japanese newspapers expressed their congratulations on the conclusion of the Chinese Tariff Agreement, and said that the feelings of the Japanese people will be greatly harmonized as a result. We hope to continue this goodwill, so that all future relations between the two countries will be more smooth. "Asahi" said, "It is not difficult for us to imagine how happy and satisfied the Chinese people will be with the conclusion of the agreement recognizing tariff autonomy. The Japanese people also suffered the same pain as China today, and by recalling these experiences, they can understand the hopes of neighboring countries, and it is undoubtedly deeply understood by the Chinese side. While congratulating China on its restoration of tariff rights, we also sincerely hope that China will take this opportunity to resolve to realize Sino-Japanese friendship. China's exclusive permission to Japan with reciprocal provisions can be said to be a lifeline between China and Japan. We have to hope that this spirit of friendship will continue to be maintained, so that Sino-Japanese relations will return to normal and the national consciousness of true Sino-Japanese coexistence and co-prosperity will sprout from this. "Tokyo Nichinichi" said, "The satisfactory result of this agreement is due to the domestic relations in China, but the main reason is that problems such as the revision of the Treaty of Commerce, the restoration of tariff autonomy, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the cancellation of unequal treaties, even if the United Kingdom and the United States recognized it, would still be empty talk without Japan's consent. Therefore, Japan actually holds the final key. If Japan wants to put down this key, China must take into account its special relationship with Japan and exchange goodwill to the full extent through reasonable and legal diplomatic means. The Chinese authorities know this very well, so using proper diplomatic means can be said to be wise and courageous." (14th Day United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) British Minister Lan visited Japanese First Secretary Yano at the Japanese Embassy on the 13th to return the salute. At the same time, he asked about the newly established Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement. After the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, what the countries are paying attention to is how Japan will handle the extraterritoriality issue expressed by China this time. British Minister Lan Pusheng will go south within this month to sign an agreement on the return of Weihaiwei. (14th Day United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Revocation of Consular Jurisdiction Will Be Carried Out in Three Steps</h3>

If there are any dealings in the future, they will be directly tried and handled by the local officials. The second step is to abolish the consular jurisdiction of foreigners residing in secondary commercial ports. The third step is to abolish the consular jurisdiction of foreigners residing in important commercial ports, such as Shanghai. At present, the parties concerned in various countries have mostly expressed that they can recognize the first step. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Naval Conference on the Verge of Despair</h3>
<p>The loudly heralded Naval Conference, which the world unanimously hoped for peace, has reached the point today where signs of rupture are increasingly evident. Although there is news that the situation is slightly better today, judging from the various disputes between countries, it can be decided that the future of the conference is indeed on the verge of hopelessness. According to American newspapers, the most difficult points of the conference are: (1) Britain and the United States refuse to join the security agreement, so France cannot reduce its necessary naval defense force. (2) There is absolutely no sign of compromise between Japan and the United States. (3) China insists on the same claims as France. (4) The United States and Japan both oppose the three-party (US, UK, Japan) agreement. According to British newspapers, there are mutually related relationships. Italy firmly demands a specific number of naval defense tonnage, because France's naval power will rise and fall depending on Italy. Since Italy does not specify the exact tonnage, France will not agree to change the numbers specified in its memorandum. The minimum limit of naval power for Britain and the United States is mostly based on France. Japan still insists on 70% of the American standard and refuses to change slightly.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacles to this naval conference are generally no more than these, and the crux of the matter still lies in mutual suspicion and prevention, and failure to meet each other with sincerity. The countries of the world, in view of the horrors of the European War, have advocated peace and sought ways to eliminate war for nearly ten years. The first Washington Naval Disarmament Conference and the second Geneva Disarmament Conference did not have any significant results. Therefore, the third London Naval Conference was held, and the hearts of the people of all countries looking forward to peace were more urgent. When it was proposed, although it was also expected that it would have no results, the general public was eagerly looking forward to it. How enthusiastically they welcomed the declaration of the British Prime Minister's visit to the United States to jointly announce the convening of the naval conference. But today, it is still inevitable that it is dull and disappointing. Is it that peace cannot be achieved, or is it that the pain of war is not great enough, and peace is not cherished enough and must be waited for in the future? In my opinion, judging from the current world situation, finance is so tight, unemployment is so high, and the path of industry, commerce and trade is so difficult. If this naval conference is completely hopeless, it does not necessarily mean that a second world war will really be realized. The costs of each country expanding its armaments and striving to secure itself will already immerse the people of the world in difficulties. If the conference is not successful, the mutual suspicion and prevention will be even worse. If there is no limit to armaments, they will inevitably compete to build warships according to their predetermined plans. (According to reports, the construction and maintenance costs of a warship are already shockingly high.) If it is not enough to expand the naval power, they will further expand the army, then expand aviation, and then expand all military ordnance and equipment. Look at the budgets of various countries in recent years. Military expenditures have accounted for a large part and have increased without decreasing. If we seek further expansion, we will inevitably increase the budget and further burden the people. In this world of economic decline, how can it be endured? Therefore, the welfare and harms of this world are all tied to this critical conference. If there are no results, even if peace can be maintained, it will only be a hidden reality of non-peace. Therefore, we still hope that there is a glimmer of hope for a turning point.</p>

<h3>London Conference Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>Participating Authorities Striving to Bring France and Italy Closer</p>
<p>Theo to Return to London to Serve as Intermediary</p>
<p>Japan-U.S. Negotiations Still Without Progress</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: There were several private conversations among the heads of the five powers today. The atmosphere was slightly more optimistic this afternoon. A British representative admitted the difficulties of the situation, but said that anyone familiar with international conferences would not be as pessimistic as some newspapers. A French representative told a Reuters reporter this afternoon that political talks were not yet over, but that it would be a mistake to predict the failure of the Naval Conference. He also said that pessimists were foolish. The telegram also said that there were crucial talks today. The British head delegate, MacDonald, said he was very excited after the meeting. It is heard that the people at the Naval Conference have been working hard to bring France and Italy closer, because the French representative asked Italy to propose a specific percentage, while the Italian representative insisted on equality with France without proposing a separate procedure. The people at the Naval Conference are doing their best to mediate between the two sides.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: The difficulties encountered by the Naval Conference last night remained serious, but after several talks today, the difficulties seemed less daunting this afternoon than this morning. French Premier Theo is expected to arrive tomorrow and will meet with the British Prime Minister. Theo's arrival is highly regarded.</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 13th: The French plenipotentiary, Briand, is scheduled to leave London on the 14th, and Theo will personally take charge. Today, when Briand met with a group of reporters, he said that the London Conference would probably conclude on Friday of next week. In view of the situation of the conference, France has abandoned its proposal on security guarantees. France plans to issue a detailed statement tonight, stating France's attitude. Italy can concentrate its navy on one coast, while France must distribute it on three coasts, so it cannot recognize Italy's maintenance of the same amount of navy as France. Briand expressed displeasure with the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States regarded France as the defendant in the breakdown of the conference, and hinted that the future of the conference was completely on the verge of crisis.</p>
<p>Kokumin, London, 13th: British newspapers commented that the biggest obstacle to the conference was Italy's firm refusal to list the exact tonnage required for naval defense. Because the naval power of France will depend on Italy's progress or retreat, Italy did not open the tonnage details, so France refused to change the figures listed in its memorandum. Most of the minimum limit of naval power between the United Kingdom and the United States depends on France's transfer, and Japan uses the United States as a standard. Therefore, Italy's firm refusal means that there is no basis for discussion in the conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 13th: A diplomatic reporter from the French Havas News Agency explained the current situation of the Naval Conference, saying: (1) Since the United Kingdom and the United States have refused to participate in a security treaty, France cannot reduce its naval defenses to the level it deems necessary. (2) There is no sign of success in the U.S.-Japan agreement. (3) Italy has not abandoned its demand for equality with France. (4) The United States and Japan do not approve of the triangular agreement. The British Prime Minister advised the Italian representative to propose a number indicating Italy's needs, but it was ineffective. Italy theoretically obtained equality with France in the categories of light cruisers and submarines at the Washington Conference, but it has not actually obtained this equality. If the discussion continues based on actual conditions, it is feared that it will weaken its position, so it declined the British Prime Minister's advice. However, after discussing with naval experts, the British Prime Minister informed the Italian representative yesterday that the United Kingdom could not support its demand for equality. Dentsu, London, 13th: The U.S. plenipotentiary, Reed, visited the Wakatsuki plenipotentiary at 3:00 p.m. on the 13th and talked until 4:20. Then he went to the embassy to visit the Matsudaira plenipotentiary for a long, confidential talk. The atmosphere was very tense when Wakatsuki and Reed met. The Nagai plenipotentiary and the Sato chief secretary waited in another room to wait for news. As a result, the negotiations between the two sides did not seem to yield. After the meeting, the Wakatsuki plenipotentiary told reporters that the meeting with Reed today was required by the future, and the content of the talks was only to continue the talks with Stimson. Various opinions were exchanged on the overall retention and the details of the numbers, but there was no agreement, and it was not completely finished.</p>
<h3>Young Plan Takes Effect</h3>
<p>President Signed and Approved</p>
<p>Issued a Somber Proclamation to the Opposition</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 13th: The Young Plan was signed into law by President Hindenburg today. The German-Polish Agreement was temporarily delayed because there were still doubts about the constitutionality and needed to be studied, but it is expected to be approved soon. After signing, the President issued a proclamation to respond to the opposition, stating that he had signed and approved the Young Plan after extremely careful consideration and in great pain. Weighing the pros and cons of the supporters and opponents, he felt that although the burden was heavy, it was slightly relieved compared to the Dawes Plan. In the thorny path of German liberation and rehabilitation, it cannot be said that it is not a step forward. Because of the responsibility of the country, he had to approve it with pain. The disputes that have been going on for months have now been settled in one day. From now on, there must be practical work to stabilize finances, develop the national economy, reduce unemployment, and maintain agriculture. Today, he has instructed the cabinet to implement this arduous work in a practical way, hoping that the people of the whole country will not be divided into parties, but will work together to seek national welfare. Recalling the completion of the establishment of the German Empire sixty years ago, the whole country rejoiced. He does not believe that the spirit of celebrating unity has been worn away, and he still hopes that the people of the country will eliminate negative thoughts, remember that unity is still intact, and strive to do something.</p>
<h3>Intense Progress of the Indian Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Gandhi Encourages Villagers to Buy and Use Native Cloth</p>
<p>Those Who Enlist in the Pura District are Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Reuters, Ahmedabad, 14th: Gandhi and his comrades left Ravagon at 6:00 this morning, and then arrived at Balsala. After a short rest until the afternoon, they will stay in Mata tonight. This morning, Gandhi spoke to reporters, urging them to enthusiastically support the cause of the whole country. Last night, Gandhi gave a speech to the villagers in Ravagon, and congratulated them on the resignation of eight village chiefs to protest the imprisonment of comrades such as Petel. He then urged the villagers to wear Indian native cloth and enlist as non-violent resistance workers. After Gandhi's persuasion, the police and village chiefs of Balsala and Mahalal villages have resigned, and the villagers should not appoint replacements in front of Gandhi.</p>
<p>Reuters, Pura, 14th: Eleven people have been appointed as "war offices" in the Pura district to organize passive resistance. Hundreds of people have volunteered to fulfill their obligations and decided to walk to the coastal countryside of Mumbai to make salt.</p>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 14th: The Mayor of Calcutta, Sangupota, was charged with seditious speech in Yangon. Today, the authorities here sent him to Yangon for questioning. When he was traveling, a crowd walked to send him off, and a motorcade followed him to Wateramha, where Sang was sent to board a ship to Myanmar. The flowers he was given were almost full of his body, and some people wrote yellow auspicious symbols on his forehead. In Sang's farewell words, he said that the administrative council of Bengal should be disbanded and replaced with those who trust in Gandhism. Please do not stain the good name of Bengal.</p>
<h3>Opening of the International Law Conference</h3>
<p>Representatives from Forty-Three Countries Arrive</p>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 13th: The conference to compile international law opened here today. There are 400 representatives from 43 countries. The Russian government also sent a listener. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations pointed out that this meeting was one of the most important meetings convened by the League of Nations.</p>

<h3>Indian Legislative Council Debates Cotton Tax Bill</h3>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 13th: The Indian Legislative Council began debating the amendment to the tax rate proposed by Chetty (a local banker, non-Muslim) today, which aims to protect Indian cotton mills from the oppression of British plain cloth. Sir Schuster, on the government side, said that the debate on this case was quite moderate. All overseas autonomous regions give British goods priority, so the Indian government believes that the various articles discussed in the original case are a practical way to get rid of difficulties. The case was adjourned to Monday for continued debate.</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party's Impeachment of the Government Rejected</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: The Conservative Party leader, Baldwin, proposed a case of impeachment of the Labour Party government in the House of Commons this afternoon, saying that commercial depression requires the encouragement of tax rates. He also said that if there is no construction, with the aim of unifying the imperial economy, the imperial group will be in danger of breaking up. He concluded by saying that the government may win tonight, but sooner or later the government will be driven out by unemployment. Finance Minister Snowden said that someone deliberately tried to destroy the government's credibility, which is very sad. The government's meaning is unambiguous, and its meaning is: (1) Not to consider the late petition for guaranteed tax rules. (2) To listen to the existing guaranteed tax rate until the prescribed date expires. (3) To announce its budget policy at an appropriate time, and cannot be announced in advance due to dozens of votes of impeachment. The telegram also said that the Conservative Party's impeachment case was rejected by 308 votes to 235 votes.</p>
<h3>French Budget Approved by Parliament</h3>
<p>Kokumin, Paris, 13th: After 25 hours of meetings and three government failures, the French budget was finally passed in Parliament with 476 votes to 112 votes, with a surplus of 20,800 francs. When the members refused to approve the Finance Committee's designation of special funds to pay the salary of the Minister of State added by the Prime Minister, Poncio asked for a vote of confidence. As a result, the cabinet won with 320 votes to 260 votes.</p>
<h3>Opening of the International Bank Postponed</h3>
<p>Kokumin, Basel, 13th: The Basel National Newspaper reported that the opening ceremony of the International Bank, originally scheduled for the 15th of this month, will now be postponed to early April. Its starting date for office will also be postponed from April 1st to May 1st.</p>
<h3>Portugal and France Sign Aviation Contract</h3>
<p>Other Countries' Protests are Invalid</p>
<p>Kokumin, Lisbon, 13th: Today, the Portuguese government has signed an aviation contract with a German company, granting it a special patent right to carry passengers and mail, and the right to land in the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean. Protests from several major European countries are invalid.</p>
<h3>Brazil's New Policy in the Future</h3>
<p>Complete Monetary Reform</p>
<p>Focus on Maintaining Industry</p>
<p>Reuters, Brazil Capital, 13th: Dr. Prestes was elected as the President of Brazil. When Dr. was nominated as a candidate, he announced his policy as follows: to make banknotes convertible into cash to complete monetary reform. The Bank of Brazil was changed to a central bank with the right to issue these banknotes, and it is planned to revise the national banking system, encourage the production of cotton, wheat, rubber, etc., and especially focus on maintaining the coffee industry.</p>
<h3>Killing Weapon</h3>
<p>Tank Artillery Vehicles Controlled by Radio</p>
<p>Advancing, Retreating, and Firing are All at Will</p>
<p>New Invention of the Japanese</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th: The experiment of radio-controlled tanks was held in the rain at 2:00 p.m. on the 13th. A short overhead line was installed on a tank car about three rooms long. The inventor, Major Nagayama, held the mechanism of the non-electric controller and pressed the key of the controller. Then the tank car would move forward, backward, diagonally, stop, and fire machine guns in sixteen kinds of activities. All actions were directed by the Major, just like a living person controlling it. Sixteen kinds of responsive bells were installed on the tank car. If you want it to move forward or stop, press the key for forward or stop, just like the controller's intention, without any difference. Yesterday's success was a good result of 100%. This controller was completed by Major Nagayama after four years of hard work. It is a major invention in Japanese weapons and will be recognized by the government.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in the Philippines</h3>
<p>More than 400 Houses Burned Down</p>
<p>5,000 People Homeless</p>
<p>Associated Press, Manila, 14th: The Red Cross and military and police authorities have set up many temporary sheds to accommodate more than a thousand fire victims in the town of Marated, so that the refugees can be spared the suffering of sleeping in the open. This major fire has not been seen in the Philippines in twelve years. The fire happened to coincide with strong winds, so it spread and was difficult to control. In addition, the houses in the fire area were lined up next to each other, and this one went out and the other one started, and it was too late to deal with them. According to statistics, more than 400 houses were burned down. Although most of them were wooden houses, the houses along St. Andrew's and Pinserfonia avenues were mostly the residences of wealthy people, and the buildings were quite magnificent. According to newspaper estimates, this fire alone left 5,000 people homeless. There are also many rumors that infants and children have died in the fire, but it has not been confirmed. The total loss is estimated at about 350,000 pesos (Philippine currency, each worth half a U.S. dollar).</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Tragedy</h3>
<p>Deceased Students Cremated Together</p>
<p>Wails Shook the Wilderness, Too Horrible to Bear</p>
<p>Dentsu, Seoul, 14th: On the Japanese Army Memorial Day, a tragedy occurred at the Zhenhai Dance Hall when a fire broke out due to a film screening, burning more than a hundred students to death. Almost every house in Zhenhai Town posted the word "Grief Residence", and the wails shook the wilderness, too horrible to bear. The most difficult thing at the moment is that it is impossible to find more than a hundred coffins at one time. Now all the carpenters in the town and the woodworking team of the fortress department are rushing to build them. The crematorium is too narrow, so more than 50 holes have been dug in the nearby fields and firewood is accumulated for cremation. People make it horrible to witness.</p>
<h3>New Discovery in the Sky</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 13th: Professor Shapley, director of the Harvard University Observatory, announced today that the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, has discovered a new planet located outside Neptune, which is larger than Earth and smaller than Uranus.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>All newspaper offices in Shenyang should be aware that since the incident in the Middle East, the Northeast Army has risen up to defend the country's borders. Soldiers are needed for this effort. The Soviet Union is the leader, and the trouble originates there. Manchuria is appropriately taking the brunt of the attacks. The war is intensifying. Airplanes are deployed, and troops are quickly suffering casualties. Armored cavalry are in groups. The border areas are being devastated. In the midst of gunfire and artillery, there is the tragedy of broken bones and broken legs. Undaunted men are succeeding those who fall. Heroes from Liaodong would rather die than be defeated. Their brains and blood are scattered, and even the plants and trees are saddened. The drums and gongs shake the sky, and the stars lose their color. Remembering Cao Gui's theory, after three drumbeats, the army weakened, and reading Li He's elegy, the scene is heartbreaking. Eating meat in rags, one's name remains in history. Wrapping bodies in horsehide, one wishes to change the calamities. Our association is initiating a memorial service to reveal the light of the deceased. We are collecting elegies and commemorative pieces for border defense. We hope that all sectors will support this righteous cause and contribute magnificent articles. Please send them to the Preparatory Office (temporarily located in the Liaoning General Chamber of Commerce) before April 1st. Your presence is especially welcomed. We eagerly await your contributions. Respectfully, the Preparatory Committee of the Liaoning Public Memorial Meeting for Martyrs Who Died Fighting Russia.</p>

<h3>Sudden Death of Liang Zhongjia</h3>
<p>A communication from Harbin reports that Commander Liang Zhongjia suddenly died at 8 a.m. on the 8th inside the Manhai Garrison Headquarters in Hailar City. He was wearing a flannel shirt, leaning against the head of the bed, with the lower half of his body dragging on the floor. There was a lot of white foam around his mouth. The first to discover this was Liang's orderly. Liang usually got up at 7 a.m. to work, but this morning, his orderly went to serve him around 7 a.m. as usual, but the door was still locked. The orderly thought that Liang might be tired from the night before and had gotten up late, so he did not knock on the door. By 8 a.m., there was still no response, so he knocked on the door to wake him up, but there was no sound. The orderly was shocked and hurriedly reported to Chief of Staff Zhang, who led officers and staff to break down the door and found Liang in the above-mentioned dead state. Feeling his body, it was already cold. They hurriedly called a Russian doctor from the railway hospital to try to rescue him. The Russian doctor said that Liang had died suddenly from heart failure and could not be saved. Chief of Staff Zhang was afraid that there was something else going on, so he ordered the doctor to scrape off the foam from Liang's mouth and have it tested for poisoning. The doctor came to Harbin on the same day to conduct the test. Chief of Staff Zhang took a train to Qiqihar that afternoon to report the incident. Because Wan Fulin was in Shenyang and had not returned, how to release the news of Liang's death was still under consideration, so the outside world did not know much about it. It is heard that the night before (the 7th), Liang and Hulunbuir Chief Executive Gui Fu, Municipal Preparatory Office Director Zhao Zhongren, and others had a meeting somewhere and did not disperse until late at night. At that time, Liang's expression was no different, and he even shook hands with everyone at the end, saying that they would talk again tomorrow. Therefore, many people suspect the cause of Liang's death. When the citizens of Hailar heard of Liang's sudden death, many of them shed tears and wrung their wrists in grief. According to Liang Zixin, a native of Shandong, 49 years old, a graduate of the first class of the Northeast Army Military Academy, he had studied at the Baoding Military Academy and served as the leader of the Black Province battalion for many years. After the Sino-Russian war, he was stationed in Hailar as the Manhai Commander. The people of Northeast China regarded him as a Great Wall, but he died suddenly, which is very regrettable.

<p>Important News</p>
<p>PMin Affairs Approaching Conclusion&gt;</p>
<p>An eight-day dispatch from Fuzhou reports that the issue of transferring the arrested members of the Five Provincial Committees and one Bureau Director to the province has recently subsided. The previous report that the Central Government had approved the dismissal and investigation of six people and that the generals handling the incident would be dealt with by their immediate superiors has also not been seen. Various speculations have arisen in the outside world. Yesterday, on the 6th, Staff Officer Yu Boliang of the Lu Division telegraphed Chen Jiliang, saying that he had arrived in Yan last night. Your Excellency's maintenance of the Min Bureau and care for our division, the planning, have been reported to our division commander and are greatly admired. The issue of transferring the six people to the province is being handled as discussed. It is heard that on the 7th, the provincial government received a clear order from the Central Government to temporarily suspend and send Lin Zhiyuan, Chen Naiyuan, Zheng Mai, Xu Xianshi, Cheng Shilu, and Wu Shu to Beijing for handling. Lin Zhong, Fu Chou, and Lu Xingrong were handed over to Chairman Yang of the Provincial Government and Division Commander Lu of the newly compiled Second Division for discussion. Chen Jiliang telegraphed Yu Boliang in reply, and also stated the situation in which the National Government had already issued orders, requesting that the six people be transferred to the province for transfer to Beijing. The disputes of the past two months may come to an end here.</p>
<h3>Joint Suppression of He Bandits by Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou reports that He Jinbiao, a bandit leader, has been plundering in the counties of Shouning, Fuan, Fuding, Qingyuan, Taishun, and Jingning, which border the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, for nearly half a year. Although the two provinces have dispatched troops to intercept them from time to time, they have been difficult to pacify because they move from this place to that place. Recently, because the Zhejiang provincial army has deployed more strictly, the bandits have all retreated to the border of Fujian to cause trouble. The counties of Shouning and Fuan have suffered particularly severely, and important towns have been captured and plundered. Recently, they have gathered scattered bandits from Fuding, totaling more than a thousand people, and have successively invaded Huotong Town in Ningde County and Zheyang Town in Xiapu County. The provincial government has repeatedly received alarm telegrams, but the garrison in Fuding is only one regiment of Jin Zhenzhong's Ling Zhan team and one team of provincial police led by Liu Zongyi, which are weak and unable to encircle them. The province also lacks military forces, and it has been proposed to recruit them and compile them into security teams in order to stabilize the local area. Later, because the conditions put forward by the He bandits were very harsh and the local people opposed it fiercely, it did not happen. Recently, the He bandits even wanted to divide their troops and directly approach the county towns of Fuan and Shouning. Last November, the Zhejiang provincial army sent a police team and a regiment of the army to Fujian to encircle them and request that the Fujian province send troops to block them. At that time, the provincial government ordered Lin Zhong's brigade and Lu Xingbang's division to send troops to intercept them, but they were unable to do so immediately due to certain events. Before long, the Zhejiang army also withdrew. Now that the He bandits are more rampant than before, it is difficult to eliminate them without a joint suppression by the two provinces. It is requested that the Zhejiang provincial government investigate and deal with the previous case. After approving the consultation, the Zhejiang province dispatched the 269th Regiment of Zhao Pingan's troops to be responsible for the encirclement. After receiving the order, Regiment Commander Zhao led his troops to gather on the border between Fujian and Zhejiang. Because all the He bandits were in Fujian, except for leaving four companies of troops to guard the two counties of Taishun and Qingyuan, he dispatched five companies of troops to enter Fujian to join forces with the Fujian army to encircle them. The army has now arrived in the two counties of Shouning and Fuan. After receiving the telegram from Regiment Commander Zhao, the provincial government ordered Commander Jin Zhenzhong and Captain Liu Zongyi to be informed, and ordered Jin Zhenzhong's regiment to be responsible for defending the local area, while Liu Zongyi's team would join the Zhejiang army to encircle them. Unexpectedly, the bandits' news was also extremely well-informed. Knowing that the Zhejiang army had entered the country, they urgently withdrew the bandit teams that had invaded the two counties of Xiapu and Ningde and concentrated on Fuan and Shouning, dividing into two groups and retreating to the Zhejiang border. Now, Regiment Zhao and Team Liu are chasing after them and have notified the Zhejiang army stationed in the two counties of Taishun and Qingyuan to block their retreat in order to annihilate the bandits and eliminate the border troubles between the two provinces forever.

<h3>Xiamen Uncovers a Counterfeit Money Operation</h3>
<p>Confiscated Printing Press and Printing Plates</p>
<p>Meal Expenses Recorded in Japanese</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Second Battalion of the Huantai Defense Regiment, under the Zhangxia Garrison Headquarters, stationed in Heshan, Wenzao Village, experienced a theft on the 5th of this month. The battalion dispatched patrol team leader Huang Qinzhong to investigate, but the thieves had already fled. He then noticed a tiled house on the hillside of nearby Hongcuo Mountain. The doors and windows were tightly closed. After several years, villagers had put up Spring Festival couplets, but this house did not. Upon inquiring with the villagers, they said that at the end of the lunar year, someone had rented the premises. Many men went in and out, acting very secretively, and at night, the sound of machinery could be heard from inside. Huang, suspecting something amiss, went to investigate. No one answered the door, so he pushed it open and entered directly. There was no one inside, but beef was cooking in the kitchen, and raw fish was placed nearby, indicating that someone had been there recently and had fled to avoid being caught for theft. A secret room was then discovered, revealing a counterfeit money operation. The items seized included: (1) a printing press, one large and two small lithographic plates – the printing press was very large and of a new style; (2) electric plates for both sides of a counterfeit five-yuan banknote of the Bank of China, Fujian branch, with clear patterns resembling genuine banknotes; (3) one lens for making printing plates; (4) ten or so copper plates of various sizes, possibly for making other types of counterfeit banknotes; (5) two microscopes; (6) a stack of two hundred yuan worth of five-yuan Bank of China, Fujian branch, counterfeit banknotes still under the printing press, and many blank sheets of paper being dried for printing. After the inspection, everything except the machinery and lithographic plates were sealed and sent to the Garrison Headquarters. After a thorough investigation, it was determined that the counterfeit currency operation was a partnership with shareholders and more than ten people working together. The technician was from a certain country, and the rest were mostly local residents. The names of the four main figures were also discovered. Commander Lin Guogeng has already telegraphed the provincial government for instructions. Furthermore, the patrol team found a meal expense ledger written in Japanese within the operation, which is also noteworthy. (March 10th)</p>
<h3>Shenyang Burns a Large Batch of Heroin</h3>
<p>Postal Workers' Attempt to Smuggle Earthenware Discovered</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Previously, the post office discovered a large batch of heroin being mailed by a Japanese man named Iinuma. After joint verification by various parties, it was confirmed to be contraband. Subsequently, the 89th Provincial Committee meeting of the provincial government resolved to appoint Chen Wenxue, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and seven others to form a Heroin Burning Preparatory Committee to draft burning methods. With the approval of the provincial government, the burning was held today (the 10th) at the Xiaocheyan Public Sports Field. A mat shed was set up in the field, with tea, refreshments, and tobacco provided for Chinese and foreign guests. Four brick burning furnaces and iron pots were erected, equipped with tools for destroying the drugs. The Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau provided security outside the field, while the Public Security Bureau dispatched four Public Security Teams, totaling one hundred and sixty people, and six firefighters to maintain order inside the field. At one o'clock in the afternoon, Chinese and foreign guests and members of the Drug Burning Committee arrived at the field, with about two hundred people and over three thousand spectators. At half-past one, Postmaster Ba Lidi, Deputy Postmaster Liu Yaoting, Postal Officer Tanaka, Chief Postal Inspector Li Zhanyuan, and Inspector Shen Songzhou of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, arrived at the field with the contraband. There were a total of one hundred and forty-seven pieces of heroin, including ninety-eight white cloth square packages, twenty-eight paper square packages, and twenty-one soft paper square packages, all in their original seals. Postmaster Ba handed them over to the Drug Burning Committee, who counted and signed for them item by item. Each item was then inspected and verified by the committee members, postal staff, and representatives from the Provincial Anti-Drug Association. The packages were very secure, with an outer layer of thin wooden box, a middle layer of tin box, and an inner layer of paper box. The boxes contained drugs, white like flour, with a sulfuric-like odor and extremely irritating. The Drug Burning Committee extracted a spoonful from each item for preservation and verification. At three forty, the one hundred and forty-seven pieces of drugs (worth over six hundred thousand yuan at the time) were all placed in pots, doused with kerosene, and set on fire. A cloud of smoke filled the air, bringing great satisfaction. Before long, the drugs turned to ashes and turned black, resembling opium. By five o'clock, the fire was still not extinguished, and the attendees dispersed, leaving forty Public Security Team members and six firefighters to watch over the scene. The Provincial Anti-Drug Association actively carried out publicity work in the field, distributing leaflets and posting slogans to raise public awareness. Film footage was taken of the burning and unpacking processes for permanent record.</p>
<p>At 5:40 PM on the 8th of this month, when Postal Train No. 103, traveling from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang, arrived at the station, Postmaster Ba Lidi, together with Deputy Postmaster Liu Yaoting, discovered four large bundles of opium, each bundle containing fifty packets. They immediately notified Station Master Zhang Shouchun, the Third Company of the Military Police, and Road Police Section Chief Han Difei, and used cars to escort the suspects, postal clerks Xu Zhenzhi and Ma Cheng, and the opium back to the post office. When questioned about who sent the opium, Xu and Ma firmly denied it. The postal authorities, as the two are employees of the bureau, convened a bureau affairs meeting on the 9th to discuss the matter. Today, after inspection by various legal entities, it will be decided whether to send them to the court or hand them over to the Department of Civil Affairs for legal action. It has been found that Ma and Xu have been working in the post office for many years, regularly riding trains. Recently, the postmaster and deputy postmaster received dozens of anonymous letters accusing them of smuggling opium, but after repeated investigations, nothing was found. This was because the inspection was carried out at the Xinmin station, while the opium had already been unloaded at Huanggu Tun or South Manchuria Station. On the 7th of this month, Postmaster Ba Lidi received another anonymous letter reporting that Ma and Xu were transporting opium from Yunshan. After receiving the letter, Ba, accompanied by the deputy postmaster, took train No. 104 to Masanjiazi to wait. At around 4:00 PM, they followed them back on express train No. 103. Ma and Xu were unable to unload the opium along the way, and were apprehended at the Shenyang station. (March 10th)</p>

<p>A Case of Counter-Revolution: Ms. Lin Fanye, the former secretary of the Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters, was detained and sent to the Suzhou Higher Court for investigation after being accused by Ni Bi and others, former members of the provincial executive committee. After repeated investigations by prosecutor Jin Henian, no evidence was found, and the charges were dismissed. Ms. Lin was released on bail yesterday (the 14th). The Shanghai District Court dispatched bailiffs yesterday (the 14th) to escort five counter-revolutionary convicts, Zhang Guozhi, Lin Hanchang, Shi Dejun, Li Zutang, and Gu Jinji, to Suzhou for delivery to the Higher Court for interrogation. Furthermore, Mao Cheng, Sun Qianyi, Huang Are, Ge Tianmin, and Chen Jihao, the main culprits in the prison riot at the Third Sub-Prison of Siqian Street last year, appealed to the High Court against the District Court's sentence of imprisonment. Yesterday (the 14th), the High Court rejected the appeal. The main culprits in the case were interrogated again yesterday, namely Zhu Enlun, Huang Zijiang, Xue Ganting, and Shen Tingzhen. In addition, the Suzhou Public Security Bureau ordered the police yesterday to deliver Zhang Xifu, who posted reactionary slogans outside Qimen in the Eastern District, to the Higher Court for interrogation and verification.</p>
<p>The Head of the Local Defense Corps' Home Robbed: At about 8 PM the night before last, eight armed bandits suddenly arrived at the home of the deputy head of the Local Defense Corps in Xukou, a town in Mudu, under the jurisdiction of the county, and robbed him of clothing, silver dollars, and other items. After hearing the news, the Seventh Patrol Team stationed in Fanshui immediately dispatched a team to pursue the bandits, killing one of them on the spot. The remaining bandits fled into Taihu Lake. Zheng, the Director of the County Public Security Bureau, personally led two police platoons to Dongshan yesterday morning (the 14th) to prevent lake bandits from Zhejiang from entering the territory of Suzhou.</p>
<p>County Police Squad Mistakenly Kills a Person: Han Jingzhou, the squad leader of the Second Platoon of the Third County Police Company stationed in Hengjingzhen of Fanshui, was leading a police patrol at about 8 PM the day before yesterday when someone ran away in front of them. They ordered them to stop, but they did not, so they suspected they were bandits and opened fire, killing a child and injuring a woman. The incident has already been reported to the county government for instructions on how to handle it.</p>
<p>The Gao Ying Case Has Been Found to Have Solid Evidence: After the Gao Ying couple's opium trafficking case was appealed to the Higher Court, a hearing was held once. Later, because the High Court was investigating evidence in the case, in addition to extending the trial for two months, it immediately petitioned the Ministry of Justice and Administration to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco to search for various evidence related to the case. It was learned yesterday (the 14th) that the Higher Court had received a reply stating that the San Francisco Consulate had verified that the leather suitcases used to transport opium, the bottles and jars used to hold opium paste, and the seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs used to seal the leather suitcases transporting opium were all strong evidence in the case. Therefore, the High Court has scheduled to continue the trial of the case in the middle of this month.</p>

<p>Two Child Corpses Found with a Note Beside Them: Two boy corpses were found on the 10th in Sha Ba Tu, Pu Nan, under the jurisdiction of the county, one about twelve or thirteen years old and the other</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>about two years old. A strip of red paper was found beside them, with the words "On the fourth day of the second lunar month of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Ting Xingruan, who gave birth to the generation, went to the Zhuang family" (民國十九年二月初四聽杏阮誰生代去莊姓), a total of eighteen characters, with many misspelled words and difficult to understand. After reporting to the township head of the township, he received permission to provide coffins and burial, pending identification of the corpses by family members.</p>
<p>Punishment for an Opium Offender Insulting a Judge: Lu Jinlong, also known as Xiao Hubei, a lodger in Songjiang, was found in possession of opium by the police on the road during martial law last year, transferred to the county government, sentenced to imprisonment, and fined. He was only released last month after serving his term, but the fine had not yet been paid. However, the Second District police station found an opium den somewhere the day before yesterday, and Xiao Hubei was also caught there. He was brought to the county government for interrogation yesterday. He confessed that he was arrested because he was visiting a neighbor. The questioning official ordered him to pay the fine from the previous case before sentencing. However, Xiao Hubei, being impulsive and violent, roared loudly upon hearing this and insulted the official. Officer Du Cheng recognized that the offender was extremely fierce and had insulted the official court, and ordered him to be put in shackles and imprisoned as a warning.</p>
<p>Training Class for Qualification Dispute: The County Education Bureau previously received an order from the department stating that, starting in the 19th year, substitute teachers should be formally re-hired. Therefore, a training class was opened in the County Normal School to train substitute teachers. The first phase has already graduated, and the second session is now continuing. However, the Ministry of Education announced a regulation for primary school teachers a few days ago, stipulating that after graduating from the training class, students must still be tested and determined. The students in the class are very panicked. They met the day before yesterday and decided to jointly petition the Ministry of Education with the previous graduates to amend the regulations.</p>

<h3>The Second Day of the City Games</h3>
<p>Track and Field Events Concluded, Results Impressive and Promising</p>
<p>Wang Jihuai First, Lu Ming and Chen Xuzhou Achieved Excellent Results</p>
<p>Six Stars Won the Women's Basketball Championship; Today is All Basketball Games</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Shanghai Special City Games. The weather was clear, and the audience was lively. Most of the events, especially track and field, were finals, making them more exciting than the first day. There were also basketball and netball games. A detailed account of the event is as follows:</p>
<h3>Lively Venue</h3>
<p>Increased Audience: The number of spectators sitting in the stands was more than five times higher than yesterday, estimated to be around 20,000. Most of them were students from municipal schools. They often cheered during long-distance races to boost the morale of the athletes, demonstrating their keen interest.</p>
<p>Excellent Venue Order: The order was not very good on the first day because athletes who had not been called by name arbitrarily joined the athletes running on the track to watch others' competitions or support other athletes. Yesterday, in order to eliminate this problem, Dai Qiliu, the Guanghua Boy Scout instructor in charge of maintaining order at the venue, specifically copied out the numbers of the various athletes. From the very beginning, he strictly forbade the athletes from entering the venue at will, and the order was immediately improved. However, it did not take long for photographers to fill the venue in groups of two and three. After the Boy Scouts repeatedly advised them to leave the venue, the strict order was restored.</p>
<p>Busy Referees: Although the referees for this games were determined early by the technical department, some of them were unable to attend due to temporary events, resulting in a shortage of manpower. The chief referee also held track and field events simultaneously for economic reasons, requiring each referee to take on several positions, running east and west, which was extremely busy. However, this allowed the event to be completed on schedule, and they deserve praise for their hard work.</p>
<p>Suitable Venue: Yesterday the weather remained clear, and the venue was drier than the day before. The running path in front of the sandpit was further rolled to make it firmer and more suitable. As a result, the athletes were able to perform with greater ease. However, the strong westerly wind caused the wood chips spread the day before to fly around from time to time, blinding the athletes' eyes, which was a minor imperfection.</p>

<h3>Track and Field General Review</h3>
<p>The track and field events were completed yesterday. Looking at the results of the two days, the shot put and 10,000-meter race results were excellent. The 800-meter and 100-meter were also not weak. Wang Jihuai's first place in the pentathlon was quite good, and the decathlon was also remarkable. Although the women's results were not excellent, it is commendable that they participated in the competition and had a martial spirit. Overall, the results were quite average. Although the weather was not warm and it had rained for several days, they had not had sufficient practice, but the results were already impressive. If they undergo careful training for another ten days, they can attend the National Games and compete with the Liaoning athletes. If they cannot win the championship, they can certainly secure the second place. I hope our male and female athletes will strive for it. Below is a record of Mr. Gao's comments:</p>
<p>In the 100-meter final, Chen Baoqiu had the fastest start, but in terms of style and pace, Zhong Lianji was the best. He steadily gained ground, and reached 50 meters alongside Chen. His speed increased even more afterward, and he reached the finish line as the first person. The old general on the field was indeed extraordinary.</p>
<p>In the women's 50-meter, Liu Jingfang's results in the preliminary and semi-final were particularly good, like a crane standing among chickens. However, in yesterday's final, she had a late start, lagging behind the others by two steps. It was not easy for her to rise quickly and catch up to second place in a very short distance.</p>
<p>Wang Jianwu is a veteran in the 400-meter race. Ten years ago, he achieved unique results in the Jiangsu Provincial Games. Although he is now working for an electric company, he still participates in sports and often stands out in Shanghai's public sports events. In yesterday's 400-meter final, Wang took the lead at the start and led the crowd until 50 meters. He continued to work hard afterwards, without any slackening. In the eyes of the public, he was already considered the first person. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden change, and Su Zuqing rushed out in the last ten meters, which was very unfortunate. However, Su was also very brave.</p>
<p>In the high hurdles final, the competition between Li Jingbang and Cao Yu was extremely fierce, and the difference in results was very slight. Before the fourth hurdle, Li was in front, and Cao followed closely. By the eighth hurdle, Cao jumped to the front. At this time, Li certainly worked hard to decide the final outcome. When crossing the last hurdle, the two jumped and landed at the same time without any difference. However, in the 15-meter sprint, Cao, having consumed too much energy from competing in the decathlon, was relatively inferior and lagged behind by half a step, finishing second.</p>
<p>In the women's baseball throw, Fan Ruimei's method was appropriate, and her strength was sufficient. She threw six times, all beyond 70 meters, which amazed the spectators. After the competition, a certain referee tried to throw the ball once, but was ashamed of being inferior.</p>
<p>Among the various competitions, the one that could arouse the audience's keenest interest was the 10,000-meter final. A large group of athletes ran bravely, circling the field twenty-five times, which was a wonderful spectacle. Moreover, Sun Qin, one of them, was funny and quirky. Every time he passed the stand, he would change to a unique posture, either bending his waist or stretching his arms, or leaping lightly like dancing or running straight like a ... The spectators laughed when they saw it. Long-distance runner Chen Xuzhou had light and agile footsteps, always leading the way. Dong Jiaxie, a Tongji school warrior, also strode very naturally, and often ranked second after three laps without being hurried. In the last lap, Zhou Bin suddenly chased out, presumably because Zhou had reserved his strength for later.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Basketball Results</h3>
<p>Six Stars Won the Women's Basketball Championship</p>
<p>—Defeated Southeast 22 to 15 Yesterday—</p>
<p>Liangjiang Forfeited the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Six Stars Won 2 to 0</p>
<p>The Six Stars Women's Basketball Team played against the Southeast Women's Physical Education School Basketball Team at the China Basketball Hall starting at 5 PM yesterday. The Six Stars' basketball skills were no longer what they used to be, and Southeast was once a well-known strong team. Both sides were extremely strong, and the competition was very fierce. As a result, Six Stars overcame Southeast with an excellent performance, won the championship of this City Games, and won the championship, which is deeply gratifying. The result was 22 to 15, referee Song Junfu.</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Forfeited</h3>
<p>In the game between Liangjiang and Six Stars the day before yesterday, Liangjiang won. However, Liangjiang player Xi Jun had served as a physical education teacher at Chengdong Women's School last year, and her qualifications did not meet the requirements. Yesterday morning, the organizing committee sent someone to the school to inquire and confirmed that Ms. Xi was responsible for morning exercises in the Chinese painting class, as well as one hour each of gymnastics and music in the other classes. Therefore, the result of that game was deemed a forfeit for Liangjiang, and Six Stars won 2 to 0.</p>
<h3>Six Stars is Formidable</h3>
<p>The Six Stars' performance last night was better than ever, because the battle line had been slightly changed. Chen Xinyuan was transferred to center, and Zhu Minbao replaced Lu Yao. Although Liang Lifang was a strong rear guard, what could she do? Chen Xinyuan is the best among the three forwards, Chen Yingrui is the fastest, and Zhu Minbao is still satisfactory. If they had used this lineup to fight Liangjiang earlier, they might have overcome them sooner, so why wait for Liangjiang to forfeit? Apart from Liang's younger sister being slightly weaker among the three rear guards, what more can be said about Ye Fuji and Yu Qiying?</p>
<h3>Southeast is Diminished</h3>
<p>Since winning the China Association Championship, Southeast has only had two wonderful performances at the beginning of the West Qing Competition. Since then, there have been no remarkable matches. After forfeiting in the West Qing Competition, its prestige was greatly reduced. Therefore, Six Stars came with a determination to win, and after the clash, they immediately saw that Southeast was no match for them. The difference was far too great. They could not attack and their defense was also very difficult. Among the forwards, Dun Xiaoping could not support the building alone. Apart from Jiang Huaixuan, there is little praise to be given to the rear guards. They were subdued by Six Stars from beginning to end.</p>

<h3>Six-Star Dominance</h3>
<p>Ordering mutual attacks, only saw the six stars unstoppable. Chen Yingrui first scored one point, then another goal, taking the lead with 2-0. Although Guo Xiaoping managed to return one goal, Chen Yingrui and Zhu Minbao repeatedly achieved great success, thus winning the first quarter 8-2. Subsequently, although Southeast had opportunities for counterattacks, Six Stars still maintained a leading position at 13-7. The Southeast's territory almost became a playground for Six Stars. In the first half, Six Stars won with 11-7.</p>
<h3>Southeast Fails</h3>
<p>Lemon restarted the battle; Chen Yingrui withdrew to rest, replaced by Lu Jinyao. The momentum continued unabated. Southeast's defense was at its limit. Chen Xinyuan displayed great power, and the third and second quarters resulted in 18-11. Six Stars advanced far ahead. In the final battle, Southeast showed no improvement, while Chen Yingrui re-entered the battlefield for Six Stars, and Southeast suffered a complete and irrecoverable defeat, resulting in a final score of 22-15.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball Semi-Finals</h3>
<p>East-West and Green Light Gain Final Rights</p>
<p>East-West Wins Over Tongji: 33-25</p>
<p>Green Light Wins Over Chih-Chih: 30-26</p>
<p>The basketball semi-finals were held last night, with two groups in total. The matches started at 6 PM at the Chinese Basketball Hall. As a result, East-West won over Tongji with 33-25, and Green Light defeated Chih-Chih with 30-26. Thus, East-West and Green Light obtained the final rights. The intense battle situations of the two groups are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>East-West Turns Defeat into Victory</h3>
<p>In the initial expectations for the East-West versus Tongji match, it was supposed to be a one-sided game.</p>
<p>Chen Chong, the forward, and Lu Zhong'en also sat out to rest. When the two teams met, Tongji surprisingly advanced like a broken bamboo. Starting with Meng Jixian scoring the first point with Hou Zhi's foul penalty, they continued to increase the score. Tongji reached 14 points, while East-West had not yet opened the score. Lu then entered the game, and the momentum was still good. East-West tried once but failed, and the ball ultimately did not enter the basket. Tongji greatly won the first half with 18-7. At this point, Huang Yunli,</p>
<p>and Liang Guoquan had to enter the game. With excellent passing, Chen Xianglong frequently scored consecutive hits, and the score was tied after five minutes. Tongji then collapsed. East-West thus turned defeat into victory. Fortunately, the final score was 33-25. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>
<h3>Green Light Obtains Final Rights</h3>
<p>The battle between Green Light and Chih-Chih was extremely tense. The scores of the two teams differed only by one or two points each time. Although Green Light was strong, Chih-Chih was not weak either, so the outcome could not be immediately determined. Chi Zhi's Zeng Guangrong opened the scoring first. By the end of the first half, it was 14-9. Lemon restarted the battle. Although Chih-Chih tried hard to catch up, they were unable to do so. Green Light's defender, Kong Guangyi, repeatedly scored long shots. Thus, Chih-Chih consistently lagged behind by three or four points. As a result, the score was 30-26, and Green Light won. The referee was Zhang Guozhu.</p>

<h3>The Unexpectedly Rising Feixing Team</h3>
<p>The patriotic girls' school in this city has long been renowned on the sea. Its liberal arts and sports departments, judging from past history, have collected the elites from the boudoirs of the north and south of the Yangtze River. The liberal arts students are good at dominating the literary world, while the sports students are mostly lively individuals who compete in the martial arena. However, this time, they participated in the city's sports meet, breaking the previous example. The so-called unexpectedly rising Feixing team is organized by a mix of liberal arts and sports students. Writers who appreciate the scenery of Lake Feng also participate in it. The spirit of this team is said to be extremely perfect, containing both heroic and refined talents. The team's idea is to fully develop their talents and fight to the end. Therefore, even though there are experienced and strong enemies in front of them in this city, they resolutely joined. It has now been decided that they will compete against the Minli team this afternoon. People still do not know where Feixing came from, so this article is specially written to describe its brief history and the origin of the Feixing team.</p>

<h3>Abolish Winter Vacation and Extend New Year Vacation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education will issue an order.</p>
<p>According to various requests, the Ministry of Education will abolish winter vacation and extend New Year vacation. It had submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was then forwarded to the National Government. The National Government has now approved the filing and instructed the Ministry of Education to comply. It is heard that the main points of the reasons advocated for this are: (1) In the past, winter vacation was mostly during the lunar calendar, close to the end of the year. Now that the lunar calendar has been abolished, if the winter vacation is not changed, the schools will be on vacation during the lunar New Year, which would be contrary to the purpose of advocating the national calendar. Now, the name of winter vacation is avoided, and the New Year vacation is extended, with the vacation taking place during the Gregorian New Year, in order to correct the hidden practice of taking lunar New Year vacations. (2) In the past, the two semesters each year were very different in length. To adjust the average length of the two semesters, winter vacation is abolished and New Year vacation is extended. It is heard that the National Government considers the various points submitted by the Ministry of Education to be quite reasonable and has therefore approved them. The detailed measures will be announced by the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Continued Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty Negotiations in Shanghai</h3>
<p>British Envoy Expected to Arrive in Beijing Within a Week</p>
<p>Nepalese Intrusion into Tibet Under Investigation</p>
<p>Mutual Benefit Opposition Explained by Finance Minister Song</p>
<p>——Conversation with Wang Zhengting——</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter met with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting yesterday to inquire about various diplomatic news. The following is a summary of his remarks: Regarding the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, Mr. Wang stated that the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement had already been signed in draft form, so the tariff portion of the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty could be considered concluded. Negotiations will continue on the abolition of extraterritoriality and navigation rights. Regarding navigation rights, he will consult with Minister of Communications Wang Boqun on all related matters. It is expected that a complete resolution of the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty will not be far off. During this visit to Shanghai, he also plans to meet with Japanese Acting Minister Shigemitsu to begin negotiations, but the date has not been set. He may be able to meet today if time permits. The reporter asked whether the Minister had read the telegram from the National Federation of Commerce opposing Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity. Mr. Wang replied that the National Federation of Commerce was mistaken. The agreement reached was not for reciprocal tariffs at all. He will ask Finance Minister Song Ziwen to explain it to the chamber of commerce in detail.</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-French negotiations, the reporter inquired about recent developments in the Sino-French Vietnam commercial treaty negotiations. Mr. Wang said that the French are most adept at changing their minds. Although Director Hu Shize is in Beiping liaising with the French envoy, there have been no new developments. The note regarding the recovery of the French Concession in Shanghai has not yet been issued.</p>
<p>Regarding the British envoy's visit to Beijing, the National Government has formally appointed Wang Zhengting as the plenipotentiary representative for negotiating the special treaty on the recovery of Weihaiwei. The reporter asked when the British envoy would arrive in Beijing to begin negotiations. Mr. Wang said that British Envoy Lampson would arrive in Beijing within a week to meet with him. The Weihaiwei recovery issue is expected to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Regarding the investigation of Tibetan affairs, the reporter also inquired about the Panchen Lama's representative in Beijing, Losang Jianzan, who had presented a petition to the National Government stating that Nepal was launching a large-scale attack on Tibet and requesting that measures be taken to prevent it. He asked whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was prepared for this. Mr. Wang replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had telegraphed all parties to investigate the true situation regarding the Nepalese intrusion into Tibet. A special commissioner will be dispatched to Tibet to inspect the situation and provide a factual basis for further action.</p>

<h3>Large Sum of Foreign Currency Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>50 Million in Foreign Currency Imported</p>
<p>Since the sharp rise in gold prices and the fall in silver prices, the influx of foreign silver into China has continued unabated. Large bars of silver from San Francisco and New York are imported every time a Pacific mail ship arrives in Shanghai (an average of seven times a month), resulting in a large silver surplus in Shanghai. It is also heard that another batch will be imported next Monday. However, at a time when gold and silver prices are fluctuating and people are panicking, a large number of silver coins from India and Annam have suddenly been transported to Shanghai, totaling 50 million yuan. In the most recent period, three batches have already been loaded, totaling 4.75 million boxes, or about 23 million yuan. The fourth shipment of foreign currency is expected to arrive next Monday, with approximately 7 million yuan arriving that day. The remaining 20 million yuan is scheduled to be loaded and shipped to Shanghai within four weeks. This huge amount of foreign currency was purchased by a certain foreign bank in Shanghai, and its purpose is unclear. It is said that it will be melted into silver bars in China and then used in our country to reap huge profits.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Condemns Yan and Feng by Telegram</h3>
<p>Love the Country, Not Personal Gain</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, the Chamber of Commerce received a telegram jointly signed by Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, which stated in brief that the purpose of establishing chambers of commerce is to supervise the actions of merchants, guide them into the right path, and thereby maintain the peace and tranquility of the country and society. Therefore, chambers of commerce are heavily responsible to the people. In recent years, the Shanghai banking and money exchange associations have borrowed and raised debts, providing funds on a daily basis. Public opinion generally points out that the chamber of commerce has neither heard the legitimate demands of representing the people, nor been able to effectively supervise the two associations. Justice is not upheld, legal rights are abandoned, and the responsibility to the people is minimal. After receiving the telegram, the Chamber of Commerce decided at its regular executive meeting yesterday to reply by telegram. The full text is as follows: "To Mr. Yan Xichuan and Mr. Feng Huanzhang in Taiyuan, upon reading your esteemed telegram, we were bewildered and perplexed, and suspected it was untrue due to the distance and remoteness. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, for more than ten years, warlord autocracy has led to successive disasters. We were fortunate that the revolution was successful and there was hope for recovery. After unification, reorganization and disbandment followed, military tensions were eliminated, and construction was urgently needed. The merchants of the whole country eagerly looked forward to governance. They spared no effort to contribute their humble efforts and actively promote the issuance of various government bonds and treasury bills by the central government. All they hoped for was to consolidate the national foundation, achieve unification, reduce military expenditure, and maintain lasting peace. They loved the country, not for personal gain. Moreover, in terms of the timing of the issuance of government bonds, except for the customs and reorganization treasury bills, the rest were all before May of the 18th year of the Republic. At that time, Huan Gong was the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Even after the issuance of the customs and reorganization treasury bills, Lu Zhonglin still took office as the Minister of Military Affairs on August 19th, and on August 24th of the same month, the Third Reorganization District Reorganization Conference was held in Taiyuan. Moreover, Bai Gong recently took office as Deputy Commander, also speaking of implementing reorganization and carrying out peace. The merchants only saw the military authorities engaging in reorganization, and the telegrams and meetings had both words and deeds. They believed that years of longing would be fulfilled in one day. They did not hesitate to transfer their trade and sweat-earned capital to help the major plan of saving the country. If this is their crime, what else can be said? If it is said that the successive bonds should not have been issued, then the two associations once held important positions in the central government and did not hear of any corrections. To know but not speak is disloyal, to not know and not speak is dereliction of duty. The people should have accusations against the two associations, but the two associations instead consider the merchants guilty. Judging from the situation and reasoning, how can this be fair? We have the following suggestion: in the disaster areas of the Northwest, deaths are occurring on the road; in the Southeast, the financial resources are exhausted. The people are like those who have been sick and have undergone surgery several times. At this time, they can only rest quietly to recover their vitality. As for how clothes can fit the body and what kind of food is most nourishing, these are all idle talks that do not help save lives. Just as Bai Gong advised Huan Gong in his telegram on June 10th of the 18th year of the Republic, we must not allow the people in the disaster areas to suffer another catastrophe. The two associations are enlightened and should consider this early. Political disputes have their own rules, and public opinion is the final force. We respectfully send this telegram to express our opinion fully. If you can examine it carefully, we would be greatly honored. The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Association Reorganization Committee bows. Cold."</p>

<h3>Commercial Ship Accident Report</h3>
<p>Collision Between Chinese and Japanese Merchant Ships</p>
<p>The Nanhua liner Lushan Maru, of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, transported passengers from the stranded Balu Maru at Nanao Island, east of Shantou, to Guangdong and other places. It then carried cargo and passengers from Guangdong and Xiamen back to Shanghai. It entered the port at 10:00 AM yesterday. When the ship arrived at the Huangpu River and docked at the Nisshin Kisen pier in Pudong, it needed to turn around. At the same time, the Longshan, of the Sanpei Company, which was transporting coal from Qingdao to Shanghai, also entered the port at 10:30 AM and intended to go to the Hongan pier in Pudong to unload. However, when the ship passed in front of the Yitaixing pier, it was sailing south and had just passed the Nisshin Kisen pier when the Lushan Maru turned. The stern of the Lushan Maru protruded horizontally into the river. The captain of the Longshan saw it and hurriedly steered to avoid it, but it was too late. The stern of the Longshan collided violently with the stern of the Lushan Maru. The rudder and stern iron plates of the Longshan were damaged, and the cabins on the stern deck of the Lushan Maru were also destroyed. Fortunately, no one was injured. This occurred around 12:00 PM. The two ships docked at the pier, and the shipowners of Sanpei and Nisshin Kisen each sent representatives to inspect the damage and make repairs first, so as not to hinder the export schedule. There are now nine cases of damage to various large and small boats that have been reported to the water police station for record, and there are many more that have not been reported. The reported cases are listed below: (1) Xu Qilang's pier boat, carrying 340 barrels of indigo for the Yongfengli customs broker, the boat and cargo sank to the bottom of the Huangpu River; (2) A certain pier boat, also carrying 360 barrels for the Yongfengli customs broker, the boat and cargo sank to the bottom of the Huangpu River; (3) Sun Hongqing's rural boat, carrying 21 tons of coal, the boat and cargo sank completely; (4) Peng Fudongzi's pier boat, the corner of the boat was damaged; (5) Han Xiaosizi's pier boat, carrying 320 bags of flour, the boat and cargo sank completely; (6) Xiang Jinli's empty pier boat, sank to the bottom of the Huangpu River; (7) Shen Shunliang's rural boat, the hull was damaged; (8) Bao Axiu's pier boat, carrying 100 pieces of foreign fabrics, the boat and cargo sank completely; (9) Kang Donghai's pier boat, carrying 44 tons of coal, the boat and cargo sank to the bottom of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Huangpu Steamer Collides with Pier</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Huangpu steamer arrived in Shanghai from Hankou at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Due to the strong wind and rapid tide at that time, it sailed south along the Pudong side and intended to turn around upstream of the Huangpu River. When it sailed to the Yangjiadu China Merchants Warehouse Pier, because the hull was too close to the shore and was impacted by the wind and water, the hull crashed into the pier, instantly damaging several pier boats, and the bow continued to advance, crashing into the warehouse pier, causing severe damage. After trying to tow the ship outwards, it returned to the company's pier and docked.</p>
<p>Zhengji Steamer Disaster News</p>
<p>This port received a telegram from Tianjin yesterday, stating that on the 2nd of this month, a Zhengji steamer arrived in Tianjin from Tanggu Port. In the Baihe River, due to careless navigation, it collided with and sank many ferry boats and cargo barges. Many boatmen fell into the water and died. The shipowner is Japanese, and it is heard that the Tianjin authorities have detained the shipowner and will punish him for dereliction of duty.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Suggests to Fessenden</h3>
<p>Eleven Improvements Needed for Concession Municipality</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for All Roads, because the Shanghai Municipal Council has issued a notice soliciting opinions from Chinese organizations and individuals regarding the municipality's opinions, yesterday (14th) submitted eleven articles in writing to Fessenden, the consultant of the Municipal Council, regarding what needs to be improved in the municipal administration, which are very important for the future prosperity of Shanghai. We will now explore and disclose the contents of the letter:</p>
<p>To Mr. Fessenden: Since you came to Shanghai to take the position of consultant for the Municipal Council of the Public Concession, the Chinese society has believed that this move is a plan to extend the life of the Public Concession and hinder the early completion of our country's movement for unified sovereignty. After reading the documents you have published with the Municipal Council, although we slightly understand your position, we are still skeptical and have not been relieved. This is evidenced by the Municipal Council's notice soliciting opinions from Chinese organizations and individuals, which has been published for almost a month, but few have responded. The reason for this is worth pondering deeply. Now, we have been informed by the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association that you have entrusted them with soliciting opinions, and we have learned that publishing the notice to solicit Chinese opinions is not just a formality, but seems to be a sincere sign of acceptance, then the Chamber, which represents all the shops in Shanghai, cannot remain silent and tell you. However, since the scope of what you want to solicit has not been specified, the Chamber will also present the general opinions of all its members for your consideration. (A) Immediately and unconditionally completely recover the concession, is the common aspiration of our people. (B) Before the concession is recovered, the administration of the Shanghai Public Concession should be improved. The details are as follows: (1) The political power of the concession municipality is only controlled by foreigners who make up a very small percentage of the population. The Chinese residents, who make up more than 95 percent of the population, do not have equal participation rights. This should be improved. (2) The municipal legislative body is extremely incomplete, because the annual Western ratepayers only hold a meeting once a year, similar to a city council meeting, with a time limit of at most three hours. It is difficult to have a detailed discussion of the annual municipal report, budget and final accounts, and citizen development plans. The Chamber believes that a standing city council should be established in the future to preside over municipal legislative matters. Chinese and foreign taxpayers should each elect a number of councilors in proportion to the amount of taxes paid to organize it, and hold meetings several times a year, so that municipal legislation has considerable completeness. The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council is only an executive committee and has no say in legislative matters. This should be improved. (3) Before the establishment of a standing city council, all annual reports, budgets, final accounts, and various proposals submitted to the annual meeting of Western ratepayers should also be submitted to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association for discussion, in accordance with law and reason. This should be improved. (4) The number of seats on the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council is not proportional to the population, but should at least be proportional to the amount of taxes paid. Although the current three Chinese directors will soon be increased to five, it is still far from proportional to the amount of taxes. To put it another way, only according to the memorandum issued by the Municipal Council on July 18, 1927 (in fact, taxes paid by Chinese residents but paid by foreigners on their behalf are not included), the total tax amount paid by Chinese residents accounts for 55 percent, and foreigners account for 45 percent. The ratio of Chinese directors to foreign directors should be eleven to nine. This should be improved. (5) All senior officials of the Municipal Council are foreigners. Economically, the increased expenditure on salaries, allowances, and travel expenses increases the burden on taxpayers. Administratively, the differences in language, writing, customs, and habits increase many inconveniences and barriers. In the future, Chinese residents should be hired to serve as senior officials, and Chinese residents should be used to record various documents, reports, official letters, and notices, so that the economy can be saved and administrative barriers can be removed. This should be improved. (6) The staff of the Municipal Council are now using the above-mentioned barriers to create many malpractices, such as the fire brigade taking advantage of fires to loot, the engineering department making things difficult and picky, the health department being hypercritical, and the police department sheltering and oppressing people. The reason for this is nothing more than seeking money. If they are reported to higher authorities, they are all dismissed for lack of evidence. To eliminate accumulated abuses, Chinese residents must be employed as senior officials to facilitate communication between superiors and subordinates, and the staff must be strictly trained. This should be improved. (7) The Municipal Council's expenses are actually used inappropriately, such as building many roads outside the concession, which only increases the resentment of Chinese residents and results in the disrepair and ruggedness of roads within the concession. This should be improved. (8) In terms of public security, according to records in the newspapers, Shanghai ranks first in terms of kidnapping and theft cases, and the distribution of police officers is often uneven. In the future, special attention should be paid to police affairs, and gambling institutions that create sources of crime, such as dog racing tracks, and late-night entertainment venues, such as dance halls, should be prohibited. It is especially important to cooperate closely with the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the French Concession to unify defense, so that criminals have no escape and the police do not shirk responsibility from each other. This should be improved. (9) The Municipal Council does not pay enough attention to Chinese education. Judging from the budget, Chinese education expenses only account for one-thirty-second of the total education expenses. In terms of population, the number of Chinese children's schools is too small, and the management of the four Chinese children's public schools is in the hands of foreigners, and there are many barriers to children's psychology and writing applications. The books in the library are all in Western languages, which makes it impossible for Chinese residents to read Chinese books. Furthermore, the establishment of three Chinese children's primary schools was decided in the previous year, but the western district has not yet opened, and the promotion and expansion have been ignored. Only one-fourth of the funds required for the construction of the two planned school buildings are listed in this year's budget. In the future, Chinese education expenses should be specially expanded. Chinese education expenses should account for at least 20 percent of the Municipal Council's annual income, in order to popularize primary education and improve citizens' knowledge. Chinese education should be unified and managed by the Chinese Education Department, and all principals and teachers, except for foreign language teachers, should be Chinese residents. This should be improved. (10) The sanitation facilities in the concession are extremely incomplete for Chinese residents. For example, in terms of hospitals, although the Chinese population is over 800,000, there are few hospitals, while Westerners have many conveniences. This should be improved. (11) The municipal administration of the concession is superficially impressive, but its content is far from modern municipal administration and can be said to be incomplete. For example, the household registration is neither strictly investigated nor statistically detailed, so that kidnappers and thieves mostly use the concession as their lair. This should be improved. The above articles are only the most important ones that are specifically presented to you for consideration. As for the commendable aspects of the Municipal Council's facilities, but for those who are progressing with the times, all facilities should progress with the times. If they stick to the old ways and ignore the wishes of Chinese residents and do not adopt the world's newest systems, not only will cooperation be difficult to achieve, but all prosperity will not be able to increase, and the existing prosperity may be lost and become an outdated market. Because we believe that you have no preconceived notions, we present general opinions for your consideration and hope that you will investigate and act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Hearing on Labor-Management Dispute in the Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>Since the pharmaceutical workers announced their strike, it has been the second day. Labor and management are refuting each other, with very resolute attitudes. All stores in the concession are closed, and slogans are plastered on the walls. The workers went to the municipal government to petition the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they convened a general meeting of members in the concession area and went to the Social Affairs Bureau of the municipal party headquarters to petition. It is said that the Social Affairs Bureau has agreed to convene a mediation meeting this afternoon. The opinions of party and government agencies on the industry dispute are supplemented as follows:</p>
<p>Talks at the Municipal Party Committee: Since the launch of the issue of placing unemployed workers, labor and management have refused to yield to each other and have published statements in newspapers one after another. It is difficult for outsiders to understand the merits of the matter. A reporter from the National Society visited a member of the Civil Training Committee of the Municipal Party Committee to inquire about the truth. The following is an excerpt of the conversation. The committee member said that the unemployment problem is of great importance and depends entirely on the proper handling by party and government agencies to prevent it from becoming a catastrophe. If party and government agencies turn a blind eye to the unemployed workers' pleas for food, it would not only be contrary to the party's aim of helping workers, but also easily lead to social unrest due to the increase of vagrants. The reason why Chinese society is unstable today is not unrelated to the failure to solve the unemployment problem. Therefore, for the sake of social stability, we sincerely hope that party and government agencies can properly solve the unemployment problem. However, before solving this problem, two points should be noted: (1) The character and ability of the unemployed should be strictly examined. Those who are kind should be placed, and bad elements should be given severance pay and dismissed immediately. (2) The financial ability of the employer should also be investigated in detail. If the financial resources are insufficient and the employer is forced to place workers, it would be like swallowing something whole without chewing, and it will not stop until both sides are hurt. However, if the employer has strong capital and a prosperous business, but does not pay attention to the unemployment problem and refuses to accept placement in defiance of the orders of party and government agencies, then the party and government agencies should severely punish them to deter troublemakers. The party's policy on agricultural and industrial issues is to develop Chinese industry on the one hand and to safeguard the lives of workers on the other. The party wants to safeguard the lives of workers under the conditions of developing Chinese industry. At the same time, it wants to develop Chinese industry under the conditions of safeguarding the lives of workers. We certainly do not allow the labor side to destroy industry in order to maintain their livelihood, but we also do not allow the employer side to destroy workers in the name of industry. This is a very clear principle. This time, the Municipal Party Committee is also proceeding with this principle in the issue of placing unemployed workers in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the pharmaceutical workers' union was once controlled and manipulated by communists, strikes and work slowdowns occurred from time to time, and both labor and management suffered from it. Later, after the efforts of this party department to reorganize it, the communist trade union was completely abolished and the current trade union was established to carry out work under the leadership of this party. However, the employer, believing that the workers were kind and could be deceived, repeatedly launched attacks and dismissed a large number of workers. The Municipal Party Committee was deeply concerned that bad elements might be mixed in among them. Last year, it joined the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in conducting a detailed review of the unemployed workers. As of recently, more than 130 people were found to be kind people and were planned to be placed separately. The second step was to start investigating the employer's business status and financial ability. Among the more than 300 pharmacies in this city, it was found that more than 40 pharmacies had developed businesses and earned a net profit of more than 10,000 yuan last year, such as Hu Qingyutang and Hanchun, which each earned more than 200,000 yuan. This time, the pharmaceutical workers' union is placing unemployed workers in these 40 pharmacies, allocating them according to their financial strength, roughly one person for every 10,000 yuan earned. After the pharmaceutical workers' union completed its preparations, it requested the Municipal Party Committee to convene a meeting of labor and management to discuss the issue of placement. The Municipal Party Committee immediately notified both parties to convene a meeting on a fixed date, but the employer refused to attend, making it impossible to talk. On March 8, the Municipal Party Committee again ordered the employer to find a way to place the workers, but the employer ignored it. Therefore, the trade union had to take direct action, sending the qualified unemployed workers to various stores to request placement. However, the Pharmaceutical Merchants Association not only refused to accept them, but also ordered each store to hire police to demonstrate and intimidate. Currently, the Chinese-administered area has largely accommodated them, and Tie Daqiao and Qingyutang in the concession area have also agreed to accept them. However, the employer of Hu Qingyutang actually used the Communist Party, and the Communist Party also colluded with capitalists to distribute reactionary leaflets under false pretenses, undermining the placement plan. It has now been found that Ru Shenxiu and Ye Zengyuan of Chuanrongtang are their leaders and will be sent to military and police agencies for arrest and prosecution. As for the employer's side, they are purely blinded by Zhang Meian and a few others. The Pharmaceutical Merchants Association is controlled by Zhang. The Municipal Party Committee will also issue a warning to them, it is said.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Approval: Shanghai Special Municipal Government Approval (No. 690) The original submitter is the Pharmaceutical Branch, submitting a case stating that the trade union is forcibly placing workers and disturbing the store's business, requesting that an order be issued to stop it. All the submissions are noted. If the trade union has any excessive actions, it is inappropriate. In addition to instructing the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus to investigate and properly stop it, the branch should still instruct the employer to abide by the approved method and handle it properly to resolve the dispute. Let it be known. This approval, attachments are stored. March 11, Republic of China Year 19, Mayor Zhang.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's General Membership Meeting of the Xiangchang Cotton Weaving Workers' Union</h3>
<p>The Xiangchang Cotton Weaving Workers' Union held a general membership meeting at the assembly hall of the General Labor Union yesterday at 2:00 PM. Over 280 members attended. The presidium consisted of Zhao Peirong, He Xiaolian, and Wu Baoshan. Gu Rongxi was the secretary.

<h3>Forced Removal of Shanties in the Wusong Fortress Area</h3>
<p>In the vicinity of the Wusong Fort Taiwan, on public land, there are general migrants from other provinces who have built grass shacks and lived there. Deng Zhenquan, the commander of the Wusong Fortress, believes that the area within three or four miles is the defense flood land of the north and south fortresses of the fortress, and he fears that bandits will use these shanties to cause trouble, which is related to defense affairs. Therefore, he issued a notice a few days ago, ordering all shanties to be demolished and moved out of the area within five days. As for the residents of private land in the Fan area, they must also comply with this deadline and report the names, ages, occupations, and number of people of both men and women.

<h3>Only One Guild Allowed for the Same Industry in the Same District</h3>
<p>Central Training Department Orders Revision</p>
<p>The Commercial Reorganization Committee Strictly Enforces the Order</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Commercial Reorganization Committee previously stipulated in the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds that only one guild should be established for the same industry in the same area. All industries in this city that have more than one organization should be merged in accordance with the law. However, the national systems of various industries are often organized separately due to customary relations and the division of importance in business. For example, in the same silk industry, there are the Qianjiang Guild Hall, the Zhejiang Huzhou Crepe Industry Association, the Shandong Henan Silk Industry Association, the Shengjing Guild Hall, and the Hangzhou Silk Industry Association. In fact, the members of each group are all silk merchants and should not be divided into separate organizations. However, given the historical and customary relations, the Commercial Reorganization Committee, in order to take the facts into consideration, originally intended to still allow them to be grouped separately. Therefore, in Article 1 of the organizational and reorganization procedures, in addition to limiting the establishment of one guild for the same industry in the same area, it added a proviso: "However, those that differ in the nature of their affairs in terms of importance do not have to be forced to form a single organization, and their names and scope shall be determined." In addition, Item 4, on merging in accordance with the law, added, "However, if there are indeed places where it is impossible to merge due to customary history or the nature of the business, it may be changed as appropriate after verification." The association submitted this procedure to the Central Committee for filing. Yesterday, it received Instruction No. 2087 from the Training Department of the Central Party Headquarters, stating that the submission and attachments had been received. Upon investigation of the various laws and regulations submitted by the association, the alternative measures for industrial and commercial guild reorganization and the organizational procedures passed by the association's standing committee, Article 1 and Article 4, regarding the joint organization and merger of the same industry, are not based on any laws promulgated by the Central Government and should be deleted and revised to comply with the filing requested by the law. The association has followed the order and deleted the alternative measures and provisos added to Article 1 and Article 4 of the procedure after deliberation by the plenary meeting, and has handed them over to the guidance department for strict implementation of the same industry merger measures.</p>
<h3>The Silk Industry Branch's Termination is Imminent</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Branch of the Commercial and Civil Association recently received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Merchant Group Reorganization Committee, ordering it to merge and reorganize with other silk industry groups and to report 11 representatives within 10 days for review and commissioning, together with representatives from other industry groups, to form the Shanghai Special Municipal Silk Industry Group Reorganization Committee to handle the merger and reorganization procedures, etc. On the 3rd of this month, the Executive Committee was convened to discuss and resolve to comply with the order to nominate 11 representatives including Wang Yansong and Shen Qinzai, and report them to the Commercial Reorganization Committee for review and commissioning. It is now heard that the association is rushing to handle the closing matters in order to hand over, and other association affairs have been suspended temporarily, waiting for the takeover.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Pacific Shipping Tide</h3>
<p>Tramp Ships Disrupting Cargo Transportation Along the Pacific Route: Since the incident of Japanese ships arbitrarily lowering freight rates, almost all shipping companies within the association have suffered significant losses in this time of low cargo volume and many ships. Shipping companies that have not joined the association have recently joined this competitive battle, further reducing freight rates for goods shipped to the United States, even lower than the association's set prices, and offering rebates. Recently, various tramp ships have even cancelled lighterage fees to solicit cargo from the Yangtze River and the Northern and Southern Seas bound for the United States, causing a sharp decline in the export business of postal ships. The association has no solution for this, and the Sino-American freight transportation has become chaotic.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Reduce Passenger Ticket Prices: The Japanese Osaka Company in this city has six ships specially dispatched in the Pacific, on the Shanghai-Seattle line. Since last month, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) has transferred the 22,000-ton Siberia Maru to this route and added new ships, Binglu Chuanmaru and Hiedamaru. Osaka Line has suffered an invisible blow in the passenger business. Recently, due to the lack of export cargo in Shanghai, it has decided not to send ships for fifty days. It is now heard that the company has decided to reduce the price of tickets from Shanghai to the United States, selling first-class cabins for only 180 yen, starting from April 1, in order to compete.</p>
<p>Stranded Japanese Ship's Cargo Discharged: The US-China postal ship Al Baham, of the Osaka Company, carrying a large quantity of salted fish and cotton from the United States to Shanghai, ran aground outside Yokohama. The bottom of the ship was trapped by reefs. The company sent a ship to tow it, but to no avail. The Shanghai cargo on board was first discharged and transported to Shanghai. Passengers from the United States to Shanghai also transferred to NYK ships to Shanghai. The ship is still being salvaged. Because the ship's hull has been damaged, even if it is towed out, it will have to be docked for major repairs.</p>
<h3>Two Railways to Change Train Timetables</h3>

<h3>Expediting the Creation of the County's Local 18th Year Budget</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received Order No. 349 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance yesterday, stating that the county's local budget for the 18th year has not yet been created and sent. Now the year is more than halfway over, and it cannot be delayed any longer. In addition to issuing an order to expedite the matter, the county magistrate is ordered to quickly follow the cost-cutting measures in Order No. 4429 of this department, in conjunction with the fund-receiving agencies, to verify the distribution and prepare the income and expenditure budget to be submitted for inspection and transmittal, and to report the compliance situation first, without delay. After receiving the order, the county government immediately forwarded it to the four bureaus of Construction, Public Security, Finance, and Education, the director of the agricultural farm, and the district chiefs of each district to verify and send it.</p>

<p>[P Counterfeit Money Case Judgment&gt;</p>
<p>Lu Li Shi Sentenced to Three Years</p>
<p>Remaining Offenders Sentenced to Two Years and One Year</p>
<p>Qian Yumin, a detective from the French Concession Police, recently discovered that Lu Li Shi, aka Zhang Li Shi, a woman from Zhenjiang with a registration number of 42 Xicheng Li, Ma Lang Road, was privately setting up a counterfeit money machine and sending people out to use it. He immediately reported to the West Detective Chief and quietly went to the woman's home and seized more than 300 counterfeit five-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank, 20 counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China, and 15 counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of Communications, totaling more than 300 yuan, and took them to the police station. Subsequently, Wang Guisheng, Ma Songshan, Li Youming, Cui Zhensheng, and related persons Chen Xide and Cao Ruicheng were arrested for assisting in the use of the counterfeit money, and the value of the counterfeit money seized was brought back to the police station together. Yesterday, they were jointly sent to the French Court for investigation. Detective Qian first reported the previous situation and presented the counterfeit money to the court. When questioned, Lu Li Shi claimed that the counterfeit money was sent by Liang Qingshan, who was on the run, and that she was unaware that it was counterfeit money. The remaining words were vague. When questioned, Wang Guisheng, Ma Songshan, Li Youming, and Cui Zhensheng all confessed that the counterfeit money was actually given to them by Hu Jinshan and Liang Qingsan, who were on the run, for use, with a charge of two yuan and four corners per ten yuan. Chen Xide and Cao Ruicheng confessed that they had gone to Ma Songshan's house to visit a few days ago and were mistakenly arrested. They knew nothing about the use of counterfeit money and asked for investigation. The Chinese and Western officials judged that the defendants were indeed guilty of violating Article 211 of the Criminal Law, ordering Lu Li Shi to be imprisoned in the women's prison for three years, Wang Guisheng and Ma Songshan to be imprisoned for two years each, and Li Youming and Cui Zhensheng to be imprisoned for one year each. Upon completion of their sentences, they will all be permanently expelled from the concession. Chen Xide and Cao Ruicheng will be deported. The seized counterfeit money will be destroyed.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Bans Cooperative Employment Agencies</h3>
<p>Recently, some people have been using the name of cooperation to organize cooperative employment agencies, collecting registration fees and demanding extra rewards in the name of introduction. Many unemployed young people have fallen into their trap.

<h3>The Missing Steamer Returned to Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Two Fishing Boats Helped to Escape Danger</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of the Wan Shun steamer of the Hubei South Lida Company being missing, as reported in yesterday's newspaper, it is now learned that the steamer sailed back to Wusong yesterday morning. However, according to the helmsman of the steamer, although no disaster occurred in this sudden storm, the danger was extreme. When the squall suddenly broke out that day, the steamer was on the Yangmian River upstream of Yawawo Sand. Due to the surge of wind and waves, the steamer lost its ability to sail. At the critical moment, it was fortunate to encounter two fishing boats from Yawawo Sand, which guided the steamer into a small port in Yawawo Sand to avoid the wind and waves. With the help of the two fishing boats, a iron anchor was lost from the fishing boat and a railing wood was destroyed. When the steamer sailed into the small port, the fire on the ship had been cut off. The fishing boat, feeling sorry for the plight of the ship being caught in a storm, lent food and used it in small quantities. When the helmsman spoke, he was overjoyed and expressed his deep gratitude to the fishing boat. It has now returned to Song without loss, which is indeed a great fortune amidst misfortune. The steamer has sailed to Shanghai. According to the information reported to the owner, Mr. Lin plans to compensate the fishing boat for the lost iron anchor and railing wood, and to express his gratitude for the deep kindness of rescue.</p>

<h3>Suspicion Regarding Fire in Machine Factory Upstairs</h3>
<p>Accidental Fire or Arson?</p>
<p>Whose Responsibility Is It?</p>
<p>Wu Lianqing, the owner of the Wu Hua Chang Machine Factory on Peng Road, rented the upstairs side room of the factory to Liu Wenrui, who lived there with his family. Wu's family lived in the main hall upstairs. Around the end of last year, a fire broke out in Liu's room, also causing damage to Wu's property. After the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade, the police discovered many suspicious points, and both households had substantial insurance policies, suggesting arson for compensation. Liu and Wu were arrested and brought to the Provisional Court for repeated questioning. Examining Magistrate Tan Xinzhen personally inspected the fire scene. Yesterday morning, witnesses were summoned again for further debate. According to the testimony of Zhou's wife, Wu was indeed at her house eating New Year's Eve dinner and playing mahjong on the night of the fire and did not return home. Wu's wife, Liu, testified that Liu Wenrui woke her up, and she immediately got out of bed and saw the door curtain on fire. She tore the curtain down, retreated, and then ran downstairs, escaping through the back door. Judge Tan then ordered the debate to begin, stating that the scope of the debate would focus on whether the fire, which started in Liu's room, was accidental or arson, and if it was arson, whether it was done by Liu alone or in collusion with Wu, and who bore the responsibility. The three lawyers representing the two defendants then presented their arguments, followed by a response from the police lawyer. After the debate, the defendants' lawyer requested that Wu be released on bail pending judgment. Judge Tan then ordered Liu Wenrui to be remanded in custody and Wu Lianqing to be released on bail upon payment of 4,000 yuan in cash and 4,000 yuan in the form of a shop. The date for sentencing was set for the morning of March 24.</p>

Resolved: It was requested that the Municipal Party Department severely punish the employers in the industry, dispatch personnel to provide assistance, and issue a circular to all trade unions to provide united assistance.</p>
<h3>Grain Dealers Request Foreign Firms to Fulfill Orders</h3>
<p>The foreign rice traded by various rice businesses in Shanghai is purchased from foreign firms. When the transaction is made, both parties sign an order stating the price and quantity of the goods. However, with the recent soaring rice prices, when merchants order foreign rice from foreign firms for future delivery, the firms often use the excuse that the goods have not arrived, causing disputes in the market from time to time. They had no choice but to report to the Chinese Grain Merchants Association, requesting strict enforcement. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the foreign firms, stating: "To whom it may concern, our colleagues have ordered various amounts of foreign rice from your firms for different periods. According to usual practice, both parties issue orders specifying all procedures. However, these procedures are sometimes not strictly followed, leading to disputes between buyers and sellers from time to time. For the sake of seriousness, our association hereby sends you a special letter requesting that after the goods are loaded onto ships from their origin, you promptly notify the buying firms in writing of the name of the ship and the date of arrival in Shanghai, as usual, to facilitate business. We would be most grateful."</p>
<h3>County Government Proclamation on Dredging Four Rivers</h3>
<p>Zhang Da Jing, Zhu Jia Bang, Heng Gou River, and West Heng Jing</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received reports from Yang Jinghai, the head of the sixth district, stating that Shen Hanqing, the head of Yongjian Township, and Shen Xinguo, the deputy head of Yongjian Township; Yang Zhengxiang, the head of Xinhe Township, and Gu Sihe, the deputy head of Xinhe Township; Shen Haiqing, the head of Qingdeng Township, and Shen Danchun, the head of Wangtong Township, etc., had requested the dredging of four rivers: Zhang Da Jing, Zhu Jia Bang, Heng Gou River, and West Heng Jing. They requested that the matter be reviewed and filed, and a proclamation be issued to protect the project, and that funds be allocated for water draining and dam construction. It was found that the rivers proposed to be dredged by the township heads were indeed essential for farmland irrigation. Because they had not been dredged for many years, they were already silted up and impassable. Farmland needed water, but irrigation was impossible, and years of poor harvests were all due to this. Now, the township heads and their deputies have voluntarily initiated the dredging, showing enthusiasm for public welfare, which is commendable. Therefore, the original reports from the township heads and their deputies are copied and submitted to the county government for approval and filing, and a proclamation is issued to protect the project and allocate funds for water draining and dam construction to facilitate the project. County Magistrate Leng, after receiving the report, stated that since the rivers were indeed severely silted up, dredging them was an important water conservancy project. In addition to instructing the district head to approve the filing, he also issued a proclamation yesterday to inform all residents of the townships.</p>

The family had newly built three bungalows and the family of five was relatively well-fed.</p>
<p>Drinking Together: On the evening of the 11th, at 8 PM, the deceased, along with friends Shen A Xiao, from No. 4 Gujia and the mountain store Su Xinyi from the Tongmao Vegetable shop in Ansi, (a Zhenjiang native from Xiaoyou Li) and the waiter A Di from Yile Tian Tea shop in Xujiahui, drank alcohol next to the tiger stove downstairs in the teahouse until 9:30 PM, when they dispersed. Shen A Xiao saw that Shitang was drunk and helped him to go home. At that time, there was a drizzle and it was difficult to see the direction. Passing by the Wudi Tou security team in Tushan Bay, they rested for a while and then continued to walk. Before they had gone far, Shitang stubbornly refused to go, shouting that he was hot and talking nonsense, appearing mad. He took off his black, straight-woven silk coat and trousers and lay on the ground. A Xiao tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen. At that time, it was raining heavily, so he had no choice but to take the clothes and hats to the Qiao family, hoping to call his father to fetch him back. But when he arrived at the Qiao family, everyone was fast asleep. Zhenyu vaguely heard A Xiao's voice, saying that Shitang was drunk and should be fetched back quickly, but because the wind and rain were heavy, he did not go to check. A Xiao waited outside the door for a long time without any sound, so he went home to bed, in order to be at the shop at 4 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>Midnight Cries: After Shitang passed out, he woke up around 1 AM, but the cold had penetrated his bones, and he could not support himself, repeatedly shouting "Help, help!" Liu Genbao, a Jiangyin native living at No. 1, who was engaged in wood carving, was awakened from his dream and got up to open the door. He was shocked when he saw him, so he took Shitang's coat and put it on his lower body and helped him to the nearby security team. It was already closed. He transferred him to the home of Captain Ding, but Ding was also not there. Asked if he had any acquaintances, the deceased vaguely said that there were relatives working at the Yongxing Li Printing Factory. He was taken to the factory and then returned. The deceased then repeatedly called "Little sister, A Bao, help, help!" At that time, everyone was asleep, only the second landlord, Hua Xu, heard about it, but he did not dare to go out to look. Later, he went downstairs and left. At that time, two passersby, A and B, saw that the deceased's face was pale, so they left him at the corner of the wall. At this time, the deceased's sister, A Cui, and her friend Tao Xiubao, were returning home from work at the Xi Heji Printing Factory on Tangjie. Passing by the spot, they vaguely recognized her younger brother, but in the dark and because he was naked, they could not see clearly and hurried past, covering their faces.</p>
<p>Died After Falling to the Ground: At this time, the deceased was exhausted, and the cold rain poured down. His condition was critical, but he was still able to barely support himself, crawling to the bamboo fence of the Mingde School on Xietu Road, collapsing and dying.</p>
<p>Two Daughters Bringing Clothes: On the morning of the 12th, Zhang Xiaomei and Shen A Bao (cousins of the deceased), female workers at the Linxing Printing Factory, went to work at the factory. The second landlord, Hua Xu, told them about the events of the previous night and a fake straight-woven silk jacket (with a shoehorn and a towel inside) was picked up by the ladder. Recognizing the item, they knew it belonged to Shen A Xiao, but they should not call people in the middle of the night to reason with him. And take away the clothes. A Xiao was not there, so his brother Shen Linsheng said, "This coat belongs to Qiao Shitang." So he was sent to the Qiao family, handed over to the dead mother and returned. Mrs. Zhu saw that her son had not returned all night, went to A Xiao's house to look for him, did not find him, went to the police station to inquire, and only then did she know that he had died tragically.</p>
<p>Discovery of the Body: At 7 AM on the morning of the 12th, patrol chief Liu Kerang of the local police station led a police patrol to the bamboo fence west of Mingde School and found a male corpse lying on the ground. The sixth district, second branch was notified. Soon after, the corpse's mother arrived at the bureau for questioning: "Was there anyone drunk last night?" Mingde School, which issued the warning, had a male corpse. Mrs. Zhu went to identify it and confirmed that it was her son, and then burst into tears. Later, the local guarantor, Cao Zhongqing, reported the death to the court for examination.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Scene: The weather was fine on that day, and over two thousand people came to watch the scene. At 3 PM in the afternoon, Prosecutor Liu from the court and others went to the countryside to examine the body. It was determined that the death was due to suffocation from cold. He instructed the family to prepare a coffin for burial and then re-verify the death.</p>
<h3>Wusong River Ferry Operators Increase Fares</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Orders Gradual Improvement of Piers</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities previously received requests from various ferry operators on the Wusong River to increase the fare by one copper coin. It immediately sent personnel to each ferry crossing for detailed investigation. The current expenses and operating conditions of each ferry were listed in detail and reported to the Municipal Government for review. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has approved that the Tanziwan West Ferry is already making considerable profits and should continue to charge one copper coin per ride. The rest are allowed to increase the fare, and the Bureau is ordered to gradually improve the piers to facilitate passengers.</p>
<h3>Tai Chi Expert Chen Ziming Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>There are two major schools of Tai Chi Chuan in Shanghai: one is the Yang Luchan school, now represented by Yang Chengfu, and the other is the Wu Yuxiang school, now represented by Sun Lutang. Luchan learned from Chen Changxing of Chenjiagou, Wen County, Henan. Now, Chen Ziming, also from Chenjiagou, is a descendant of Chen Bu, a figure from the early Ming Dynasty who mastered Tai Chi Chuan. The Chen family has produced many famous individuals over the generations and benefited from Chen Changxing's cultivation. Chen Ziming is particularly accomplished. Chen Ziming, in his prime, visited famous teachers all over China, covering half the country. As a result, his skills are even more refined. Because the Chinese people admire martial arts, and Shanghai is a thriving center for promotion, Chen Ziming is willing to dedicate his skills and teach publicly wherever he goes. Chen is currently residing at the residence of Mr. Jiang Zicheng at Lao Ziji Lu, Mengdelan Road. Those who wish to learn can contact Mr. Jiang.</p>
<h3>Wusong Pig Boat Registration</h3>
<p>The Special Municipal Area Ship Tax, which was changed from a monthly tax to a per-trip collection, has aroused opposition from short-distance barge merchants. A few days ago, the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau detained more than ten boatmen, including Zhang Fuli and Gu Yutai, who were subsequently released on bail by various tax firms. It is now learned that more than ten boatmen from export merchant ships, including Da Qia, Da Fa, Da You, Da Sheng, and Da Tao, who unloaded floral clothing and flower seeds from Shanghai yesterday morning, were again detained by the Seventh District Public Security Bureau. The matter has not yet been resolved. However, more than ten ships carrying imported fresh pigs that arrived a few days ago sent Zhang Fuli and Zhang Changfu to the Ship Tax Registration Office yesterday morning to meet with Director Zhuo of the Ship Tax Office of the Finance Bureau and Director Yang of the Port Authority, requesting that the registration fee be changed to two yuan per ship. The director of the office agreed, and the boatmen went to register. The matter was thus concluded. As for the secondary ship tax, the representatives requested that one yuan be paid for each trip. Directors Yang and Zhuo stated that these regulations were all orders from superiors and could not be changed without authorization, and they would wait for the superiors to review and approve. The boatmen then left.</p>

The Provisional Court repeatedly brought them in for trial. Lawyer Li Yanzhan Ji Feng defended Li, saying that Li had been a chef in the vegetable section of the amusement park and had not engaged in any theft. The verdict was reserved for a later date. Yesterday morning, Lawyer Zhan went to the Fifth Court to await the verdict. Judge Tan then took the bench and ordered Hua and Li to be brought forward.

<h3>Slapping a Woman's Cheek Costs 35 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Wang Jinmei Insult Case</p>
<p>Wang Jinmei, the director of female receptionists at the Little World, was beaten by the rogue Zhang Genbao and his gang near the Great Bell in the French Concession on the 9th of this month. The police arrested Zhang and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the French Court for prosecution. The plaintiff, Wang Jinmei, stated that on that day, she was on her way home from Little World when she was suddenly slapped on the cheek from behind by Zhang Genbao, whom she did not know, at the intersection of Madian Road near the Great Bell. She immediately shouted loudly, and the police arrived and caught him. At that time, her watch was also lost. She requested an investigation. The defendant's lawyer argued on his behalf that the plaintiff was working as a female receptionist at Little World. The defendant and several friends went to play there and had a conflict due to teasing, which led to a quarrel. At that time, the plaintiff called the police and brutally beat the defendant and others, causing injuries. Therefore, he was angry and waited for her in the controlled area and beat the plaintiff to vent his anger. It was purely revenge and there was no robbery of her watch. The defendant was young and ignorant, and requested leniency. The defendant Zhang Genbao testified that his friends told him to beat her, and the rest of his testimony was evasive. The plaintiff, Yu Jinmei, also stated that she was not a receptionist, but the director, and had never had any teasing or quarrels with anyone. The defendant's lawyer's statements were false, and requested investigation. Presiding Judge Zhu sentenced the defendant Zhang Genbao to a fine of 35 yuan.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper's local news column a report that detectives from the French Concession police arrested bandits on the upper floor of the Dahua Middle School, we have found that the building leased by our school is in the rear and has nothing to do with where the bandits lived. We are sincerely afraid of being misled by rumors, which would affect the reputation of our school. Therefore, we are writing specifically to correct this. We hope you will publish this for us.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>Master: I rang the bell for quite a while. Why are you always so slow to come?</p>
<p>Servant: Master, I just fell down the stairs.</p>
<p>Master: In that case, you saved some steps. You should have come even faster. Why are you late instead?</p>
<p>Guest: Who is in charge of your company?</p>
<p>Waiter: Who is in charge? I don't know. I am often the one being blamed.</p>
<p>Door-to-door peddler: Sir/Madam, look at how good this batch of goods is. Would you like me to deliver more to you?</p>
<p>Housewife: Come back next Friday to discuss it.</p>
<p>Peddler: Sorry, I happen to be going to Suzhou that day.</p>
<p>Housewife: Because I happen not to be home that day either.</p>

<p>Child: I close my eyes and pretend to be asleep.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of the Capital</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Since the suspension of bus services in the capital, there has been no news of their resumption for several months. It is presumably due to poor business and excessive embezzlement. However, the distance from Xiaguan to the city is more than ten miles. Although there are small trains, carriages, cars, and rickshaws, people in the middle class are generally unwilling to use them, as they are not as cheap and fast as buses. Therefore, since the suspension, the general public has suffered, and the carriage and rickshaw businesses have undoubtedly doubled their profits. However, those who are familiar with the roads and experienced in traveling around the capital still take cars, and the fares are equivalent to those of buses. However, these cars are not "public" but "wild chicken" cars.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the film industry has sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, with names like National, World, Nanjing, New Light, Datong, and Central. The best performer is National, due to its superior location and seating. World, Datong, and Nanjing also show many famous films. However, the previous screenings of "King of Kings," "The Ten Commandments," and "Ben-Hur" generated considerable profit but later caused great resentment. The authorities subsequently issued a ban on "King of Kings." Recently, a film censorship bureau has also been established.</p>
<p>The roads in the capital, except for Zhongshan Avenue, are generally not good. Since the beginning of spring, continuous rain has made them muddy and difficult to travel, especially when cars pass, splashing black mud everywhere. Even if one avoids them by more than ten feet, one can still get covered in mud. When meeting on a narrow road, one can only sigh helplessly. Due to the heavy traffic and excessive loads, there is occasional erosion on Zhongshan Road as well.</p>
<p>Although the cost of living in the capital is increasing daily, the price of food is still relatively cheap. However, due to the rain this spring, prices have gradually risen. The current price of ordinary rice is around fifteen yuan per picul, leading to increased food costs in various institutions or unsatisfactory and unappetizing meals. The common people are crying out in hardship.</p>
<p>The most famous hotels in the city have always been the Anle Hotel and others. Recently, since the opening of the Central Hotel, the scale has become even grander. The high-powered electric lights shining at night can be seen from afar, adding to the commercial splendor of the capital. The World Hotel is also under construction near Menlian Bridge near Hua Pai Lou, and there will surely be a more intense competition in the future.</p>
<h3>A Record of Plum Blossom Viewing in Dingli</h3>
<p>— Listening to Eternal Life</p>
<p>People only know that the plum blossoms in Hangzhou must be counted as those on Gushan and Lingfeng, but they do not know that Chao Mountain, west of Linping, is even more worthy of seeing. Even if they know about the plum blossoms on Chao Mountain, they must count the Song plum tree in the Great Hall of Bao'en Temple as unique. But they do not know that south of Ma'an Mountain, there is a village called Dingli, which has even more to offer. This spring, Monk Shipiao sent a letter inviting me to visit Chao Mountain, saying that the thirty miles of jade flowers were as bright as snow, and the fragrant breeze moved, clearing the lungs and heart. This was not something to be missed. Thus, my heart was stirred, and I invited Deng Fenweng, Wang Lunfu, and Tang Xian to go together. For seven hours, the train transported us from Shanghai, and we spent the night at the Da Yuan Temple. The next morning, there was a heavy fog. All the mountains were asleep. In the hazy and indistinct light, the sun came out with halo clouds, and wild birds chirped from time to time. We walked together in the mountain belly amidst the diffuse fog. The distant fragrance had already arrived with the east wind. The follower carried a jar of wine and five sets of utensils. The snacks were selected from turtle doves, wild ducks, beef jerky, peanuts, and the like. We drank along the way. Soon, thousands and thousands of trees were hung with copper bells. The mountain mist gradually cleared, and shadows of people were everywhere. The faint smoke and slender jade, quietly wafting cold fragrance, also gradually came into view. Moreover, between Qian Bieyun, short fences, and sparse bamboo fences, one or two branches stretched obliquely across the road, blocking my hat brim. So I also lowered my head to pass. Reading the public's line "People are still unyielding towards daffodils, how dare they not bow their heads when they see you," I was moved by it. After walking about a mile, we drank by the White Horse Pit, laying a cup of wine under the plum tree. Arriving in Dingli, the branches and twigs were disordered all the way, and the profuse blossoms were horizontal and vertical. The flowing light at the bottom of my eyes was not inferior to the salt flakes. Arriving at this village of cold fragrance and solitary beauty, I doubted whether I was not stranded in a rugged and desolate place. Its power to shift emotions and relieve suffering was greater than drinking ten thousand bells of wine. The sun gradually rose, and we sat down in a harmonious position. We agreed not to walk, took futons, and sat cross-legged in the midst of ten thousand flowers. The sound of bees was there or not. The forest breeze entered the wine. We held our breath and tasted it quietly, unaware of the evening.</p>
<h3>Overseas Plum Blossom News</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang, the king of the Chinese opera world, and his party of twenty-one people arrived in New York on February 9 to perform in the United States. Wu Chaoshu, our minister to the United States, believed that Mei Jun's trip carried the important mission of promoting Chinese art and bridging Eastern and Western cultures. He hosted a banquet at the embassy on the evening of February 14 to welcome them. That evening at 10:00, a grand reception was held at a famous hotel in Washington, inviting Mei Jun to perform. American dignitaries, senators, and ambassadors and ministers from diplomatic missions were invited in advance to watch the performance, so that Westerners could gain a deep understanding of Eastern art. Except for President Hoover and his wife, who were out fishing and had not returned, the invitees included Vice President Curtis and his sister, Mrs. Gann, the wife of former President Wilson, the Secretary of the Interior and his wife, the Secretary of Commerce and his wife, the Acting Secretary of the Navy and his wife, the French Ambassador and his wife, the German Ambassador and his wife, the Italian Ambassador and his wife, the Japanese Ambassador and his wife, the Turkish Ambassador, the Cuban Ambassador and his wife, the Spanish Ambassador and his wife, the Chilean Ambassador and his wife, and the Swiss, Finnish, Panamanian, Egyptian, Bulgarian, Venezuelan, Albanian, Dominican, Polish, Dutch, Norwegian, Siamese, Paraguayan, Ecuadorian, Nicaraguan, South African Republic, and other countries' ministers and their wives, the Undersecretary of State and the undersecretaries of various departments and their wives, many senators, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Potter, and many representatives, as well as five hundred people, including naval and army officers and social celebrities. The splendor of the occasion was unprecedented. The performances of "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" and "A Thousand Pieces of Gold for a Smile" were greeted with thunderous applause. It was considered something never seen before. This was the first meeting between Mei Jun's art and the American people. Mei Jun then returned to New York by car at one o'clock that night and was scheduled to perform there on the seventeenth.</p>
<h3>The Second Day of the Bee Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Swallow</p>
<p>The Bee Painting Society's exhibition opened on the Flower Day.</p>
<p>Fine rain and slanting wind, few guests. Until the second day, the sky cleared and the rain stopped. In the afternoon, those who bought tickets to enter the venue came one after another, exceptionally crowded. Before four o'clock, more than two hundred tickets had been sold, which can be described as a great success. The paintings displayed at the venue were even more exquisite than on the first day. Among the works of the society members, Qian Shoutie's Huangshan landscape folding screen was the most magnificent. The viewers were crowded around it. Sun Xueni's landscape followed the style of Xiang Huaishu Mei. The large painting displayed this time was entirely in the style of Shitao. The brushwork was bold and thick, which was completely different from the past. It was indeed a masterpiece. Zheng Wuchang and Xu Weibai transformed brush and ink into smoke and clouds, with the beauty of different tunes played with equal skill. In particular, Zheng's painting of silkworms and mulberry and Xu's painting of red plum blossoms were more transcendent with less strokes. Jiang Runsheng's Orphan Picture was vividly lifelike and could be considered a masterpiece. Qiu Zhixiang's imitation of Shitao's landscape, painted on Goryeo paper, showed even more skill. The best of the figure paintings were Hu Sanqiao's "Adding Incense" and He Tianjian's "This Night, Listening to the Sounds at Xie's House." One imitated Yu Hu, and the other copied Xiaolou. Bai Longshanren also had three exquisite paintings on display, especially the chrysanthemums and sparrows. Zhang Shanzi and Zhang Daqian's brothers were exquisite in painting tigers, horses, landscapes, and flowers. This was most rare. Others such as Ma Wanli's flowers and Ye Weixin's landscapes were all outstanding young artists. As for the ancient paintings, there were even more and more exquisite than on the first day. Bada Shanren and Shitao Liangfeng were the most numerous. Others such as Huishu, Cangshuo, Tiesheng, Baiyang, Nansha, Ruobo, Shuwen, Zhuxu, and Dongxin, each painting was a treasure and a wonderful work. It was like entering a mountain of treasures. It was a pity that it was too late and I could not see them all. I will briefly record what I saw.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (7)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the morning of the fifteenth, I visited Liang Zhongheng of the Overseas Chinese Daily. Mr. Liang was enthusiastic and patriotic, and his words were sad. The people of Yunnan still have protectors because they have a master to rely on. What can we Chinese rely on? You are traveling on the road. If someone attacks, where can you seek protection? The Chinese revolution has been going on for many years. Overseas Chinese have donated millions of dollars. Up to now, they have not been able to negotiate with the French to set up a consulate. Diplomacy has failed so much. Internal strife is the daily routine, and overseas Chinese are allowed to be slaves without question. Alas! I was saddened by his words. In the afternoon, I visited Mr. Qun, who said that the manuscript must be submitted to the police station for inspection before 2:00 PM before it can be published. Therefore, I was unable to see it. In short, the press is very dissatisfied with the endless Chinese civil war.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen of Qun Bao talked about the situation of the overseas Chinese, saying that there were a total of 300,000 people in Annam, 20,000 in Saigon, and 100,000 in Dikean. Dikean is Chinatown. The overseas Chinese property is mainly rice exports. It is called rice, but the capital is often millions of dollars. It is sold to ports in the Pacific Ocean. Shanghai and Guangdong also eat their rice. The so-called Annam rice is divided into five groups: the Guangzhao Group, the Chaozhou Group, the Fujian Group, and the Hakka Group. The number of Cantonese is seven, and the number of Fujianese is three, but the wealth of Fujianese is better. The autonomous groups are the General Chamber of Commerce and schools, about five or six, such as the Decheng Middle School and the French School, which are middle school level. However, others say that there are considerable restrictions on higher education here, which means that it is not easy to run a school, or perhaps the level of education here does not have high-level knowledge. According to the female principal, there are three or four girls' schools in total, but old-style private schools are everywhere, just like the use of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth, a Sunday, Huang Qiting, the supervisory committee member of the Annam Kuomintang General Branch, and Feng Mingfen, the principal of the Yonglong Provincial School, came to talk to me at the Zhenhua Girls' School. They mentioned my theory of the World Kunhua Datong Federation, and that the press should publicly disseminate it, which is related to the gospel of human peace. Even the French government has no objection. I said that I have already printed a French translation of the outline, but it was sent to Singapore. The translation was proofread and printed by Shen Zhongjun, an old French expert in Shanghai. The French consul in Shanghai saw it and was greatly surprised, saying that we in the West have made many inventions, but we have not thought of a way to avoid war. Let you Orientals invent it. I still want the original book to be translated into French. I also talked to the manager of the French Daily in Shanghai for a while, and he also said that he was very happy to get this news. The French love freedom, and if there is a good method, they will welcome it. Today's world is killing each other, and it is also because there is no good way to escape. It is not that people have hatred for each other. The method should be discussed by the public.</p>
<h3>A Poem of Seventy Rhymes on Angola</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yansheng wrote in New Capital, Turkey (December, Year 18)</p>
<p>Vast is Turkey, geographically blocking East and West.</p>
<p>Seven hundred years since its founding, thirty-six generations have passed. (Turkey was founded by the Ottoman Emperor and passed down for 36 generations until its demise in 1922.)</p>
<p>The wind and clouds converged in a great upheaval, and the prestige led the clans.</p>
<p>Emperor Osman, with his heroic plans, was blessed.</p>
<p>The imperial family suddenly declined, and the criminal administration lost its balance.</p>
<p>The unbuilt was eventually ruined, becoming prey for the strong.</p>
<p>The unprecedented European War began, and the national power was increasingly oppressed.</p>
<p>Its territories were all divided, and the boundaries were arbitrarily clipped.</p>
<p>Greece showed its old resentment, and its dazzling soldiers came even closer.</p>
<p>The British followed behind, and the crisis was truly unpredictable. (The Greek-Turkish War began in 1919, and the British actually dominated it.)</p>
<p>The hearts of the people had not completely died, and the three households of Qin could be restored.</p>
<p>Heroes rose up and restored the old business in one battle. (The current Turkish President Kemal raised troops in eastern Asia Minor, and finally defeated the Western Greek army near Angola. After the great victory, the enemy was broken, and the remaining bandits all fled.)</p>
<p>Seated in the ancient capital (In 1920, the Angola government was established, and Kemal was the speaker of the National Assembly), directing the heart and belly.</p>
<p>At that time, trust was difficult, and the wounds were lamented and filled with eyes.</p>
<p>The tragic Luo Qunying, relying on bamboo to form warp and weft.</p>
<p>A few days to revive the old brigade, a few days to inspect the people and shepherds.</p>
<p>A few days to praise the state, a few days to drive out the clan.</p>
<p>Announcing the republic and expelling the Sultan religious leader, he is truly a powerful person, who can turn the valleys by hand.</p>
<p>Suddenly the whole situation was settled, and the sky was solemn.</p>
<p>Internal networks have been managed, but diplomacy is not easy to resolve.</p>
<p>The great powers met in Lausanne (The Lausanne Conference was held in Europe in 1922 to resolve the Eastern Question), relying on frustration.</p>
<p>Zheng Qiao was selected as an envoy, and Cao Zhitan was listed (The Turkish representative was General Ismet, the current Prime Minister.)</p>
<p>National rights cannot be lost, and national shame must eventually be avenged.</p>
<p>Jin and Chu still think of invading, and the covenant has been torn several times (The conference did not allow the demands of the Turkish representatives. Negotiations were interrupted and resumed the following year. The treaties were concluded equally.)</p>
<p>Weeping and recovering the old capital, the national spirit has since been alive (In October 1923, Turkish troops re-entered Constantinople, and the people welcomed them with tears).</p>
<p>Striving to join the great powers, reform and advance the martyrs.</p>
<p>A distant guest came from thousands of miles away, relying on light chariots to hear and see.</p>
<p>The future bears good fortune, and the sightseeing is gratifying.</p>
<p>The luggage is worth the cold winter, and the trudging is not tiring.</p>
<p>Setting off in the morning at the Hei Sea, arriving in the evening at the Zhuangji County (Angola).</p>
<p>Lodging in the secluded building in the hostel, driving to the Guangdian.</p>
<p>Suddenly the city is prosperous, controlling the border and the dangerous.</p>
<p>The expression is stubbornly locked, and the passes are moving like lightning.</p>
<p>The shape is superior to West Asia, and the collar connects three continents (Angola is surrounded by mountains and its shape is dangerous, which can control the key points of the three continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia).</p>
<p>Determining hegemony, the heart struggles, and the power to invite success can be aided. (The Greeks, Persians, Romans, Seljuks, and Arabs have all occupied this land.)</p>
<p>Seeing the ancient battlefield, the ramparts turned empty.</p>
<p>The suburban drinking water cave, always watching the water filling the pond.</p>
<p>The old vines rise to the pine forest, and the hawks and falcons soar in the clouds. (History records that the Roman master Pang and the Anxi King Miderdati, the Mongolian Timur and the Turkish Sultan Baya Jide all used troops here.)</p>
<p>Seeing the ancient imperial palace, the Chongji Yinling is occupied.</p>
<p>Other generations mourn loneliness, imagining the image. (History records that King Alexander of Macedon once held meetings with monarchs and ministers of various countries twice in this capital. The old site of the palace on the rock still exists.)</p>
<p>Huabiao met for thousands of years, and the ruined walls survived the ruins. (The column of the Roman Emperor Augustus and his living temple are still there.)</p>
<p>Engraving the King's Meeting Picture, the cold sun shines on the stone slabs. (A large number of ancient steles are piled up on the side of the temple, all depicting the stories of the Greek, Roman, Persian, and other world dynasties, hunting and riding. Unfortunately, they cannot be rubbed.)</p>
<p>The ancients are gone, and the new state is established today.</p>
<p>The cultural relics follow the Thai West, and the clothes of the dynasty and the field change (reforming the text and abolishing the red crown).</p>
<p>The track is strategic for transportation, and the well market is vigorously repaired.</p>
<p>What are the three things? The six prefectures are especially lush. (Angola is building municipal facilities in the new district. Everything is available for residents, such as electric lights, gas, and running water. The Presidential Palace, State Council, Parliament, and various departments are newly built and heavily planted with trees.)</p>
<p>The garden is full of frost flowers (although the park has entered winter, there are still autumn flowers).</p>
<p>The itchy order is full of lectures, and the bronze statue casts a great medal. (There is a bronze statue of General Kemal at the entrance of the new city, which is heroic.)</p>
<p>The official road is as flat as a grindstone, and the Hua houses are scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>The ring is full of crystal salt, and the brocade felt is dazzling.</p>
<p>Fresh fruit pushes gold lemon, and plain silk unfolds beautiful silk (both are the products of the land).</p>
<p>He is happy to follow the rule of law, and public and private friends are happy.</p>
<p>It can be a great success in ten years, and prosperity is expected to be the same.</p>
<p>My thoughts are difficult to express, and my intentions are good.</p>
<p>I will not stay in Yu for a long time, and I will come to Yu for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>Looking back at the homeland, the love in my heart turns.</p>
<p>There have been twenty years of upheaval, and the north and south are still coated with charcoal.</p>
<p>How can we bear to wield the same chamber sword, and not solve the hanging problem.</p>
<p>Singing generously and weeping, when will the Yu domain feast?</p>
<p>Commonly known as two sick men, one sick man has been released.</p>
<p>Ming Xiaozou Dao Gui, who has been a good doctor. (Europeans call Turkey and China two sick men in East Asia)</p>
<p>Lying across the red county map, the colors of mountains and rivers are dim.</p>
<p>And I got General Kai. (Refers to Kemal) He resisted the thieves with his festival.</p>
<p>Lai Erji cares for danger, and Lai Erxing's country.</p>
<p>The Han and Tang dynasties have been buried, and the Song and Ming dynasties have been trapped in accumulated habits.</p>
<p>The masses have been in decline for a long time, and the husband should be responsible.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor is hanging in the sky, and the descendants may not be wrong.</p>
<p>Zhongshan is broad and magnificent.</p>

<h3>Financial Spot Gold Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>After the initial record, it was weak, and the situation of yesterday's spot gold was changing from strong to weak. There were advances and retreats from time to time. In the morning market, there were three and a half taels high and low, and in the afternoon market, there were also about three taels. The buying and selling among the industry was not enthusiastic, because in the forward trading season, Yongchenchang, Fuyu, Taixing, Dadecheng, etc. all had sales, and Yuanheng, Shunli, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanmaoyong, etc. were all buyers. As for foreign exchange, it changed from steady to flat and weak. Since the large volumes in the early market saw an increase, the silver price shrank instead, so the market opened high. After that, buyers were more frequent, and it once exceeded 498 taels. Later, the selling pressure was strong, and foreign exchange also turned into a large movement, so it fell sharply by more than three taels. In the afternoon market, it became increasingly weak, and the bills were weak, and the transaction was even more quiet. Hengxing, Shunlifengyong, etc. sold some, and Yanyu, Fuyu, and some small households bought a little, so the price suddenly retreated to within 9,004 taels, and finally pulled up about two taels.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, because the US silver fell, it opened high. Yesterday, the London silver bars were not more recent, and the distant term had increased by one-eighth. The silver price was reduced by one-eighth, so the opening of the spot gold in April added one or two cents, which was 496 taels and six cents. The gross market jumped from 96 taels and one cent to 98 taels and seven cents, and the buyers were diligent and the foreign exchange was also strong. The bank did forward trading in English gold at 11 and a half pence. Mitsubishi Mitsui absorbed Japanese gold at 1 tael, 0 point, 3 points, 8 points and 7 points and 5 points. When the shilling was revealed, it returned to 98 taels, and the listing was no longer changed, with a slight increase of two or three cents. Later, the internal slightly loosened, and Sumitomo bought forward Japanese gold at 1 tael, 0 points, 2 points and 5 points, so it dropped by 1 tael. After 1,000 points, it was 97 taels and two cents. After a while, it increased by eight or nine cents, which was 98 taels and one cent. After 10:30, the bills were especially loose, but it was not easy to sell them, and the people's hearts showed weakness because of this. Moreover, Yongchenchang, Yu Da, and hedging volumes took this opportunity to sell, so the price fell into a fatigue situation and became more and more declining. It dropped by a total of three taels, and at 11:45, it was only 95 taels, two or three cents. The transactions of English and Japanese exchanges were dull, and by noon, it had slightly recovered by one tael, and then closed at 96 taels and three cents.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was weak, and the closing fell by a small one tael. The afternoon market opened at 95 taels and eight cents, followed by an increase of five or six cents, which was 96 taels and four cents. Then, due to the sale of retail investors, it fell to 95 taels, four or five cents. At 2:30, it increased to 96 taels, but there was no large volume for supply, and there was no corresponding transaction in foreign exchange. In the afternoon, English and Japanese exchanges all tended to be loose, so the forward was only bought by Zhenjin and others at 1 tael, 0 points, 2 points, 8 points and 7 points, and Zhifengyong, Hengxing, and Taixing sold volumes, so the price suddenly showed weakness. It was unloaded by more than two taels, until 4 o'clock, it suddenly fell to 93 taels and six cents. Finally, it raised about one tael, which was 94 taels and a half. At 4:30, the market closed at 94 taels and four cents, which was a drop of one tael compared to the 13th.</p>
<p>The maximum price during the day was 98 taels and seven cents, and the minimum price was 93 taels and six cents, with a difference of 5 taels and one cent. The opening price is still calculated at 522 taels and six cents, and it still needs to be reduced by 24 or 5 taels to 26 taels. The book is registered at 95 taels this month and 96 taels next month. The water replenishment is 95 taels in the afternoon and 93 taels. The opening price is still pressed at 26 or 7 taels to 28 taels. The goods opened early at 96 taels and a half, closed at noon at 96 taels and six cents, at 96 taels in the afternoon, and closed at 94 taels and two cents.</p>
<p>The forward trading was idle, and the numbers such as Yongchenchang, Yu Da, Tongfengyong, Dadecheng, Taixing, Fuyu, Senchangyong, and hedging volumes all had sales. Wanxing, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Jinan, Yanyu, Yuancheng Yong, Yuanyuyong, Yuanheng, etc. all had purchases. Hengxingyuan Qinyichang, etc. had occasional ups and downs. The Dalian gang bought more than they sold, about 1,450 volumes, and then sold more than 500 volumes. The bills had a slight hedging purchase. In the afternoon, the industry had few ups and downs, even less than in the morning market. It is estimated that Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Taixing, Senchang, Yuanheng, Shunli, Wanxing, etc. sold the most, and Fuyu, Yanyu, Yuanmao, and small households all chased slightly. The Dalian gang trusted 700 or 800 volumes and bought 2 or 3 volumes. The rest of the numbers were all scattered buying and selling.</p>
<h3>Gold Exchange Ban on Off-Exchange Forward Transactions</h3>
<p>This session's forward trading was changed to the day before (the 15th) because the 16th fell on a Sunday. Unexpectedly, certain firms had already privately engaged in forward trading yesterday, with bulls paying premiums estimated at around one tael or less. The exchange's board of directors discovered this and, considering that member firms should not conduct transactions privately before the designated date, immediately notified the brokers' association to stop the practice. A special announcement was also issued, stating, "According to Article 42 of Chapter 10 of the amended business regulations of this exchange, forward trading is to be rolled over to the next month's period on the 16th of each month, etc. Since the 16th of this month falls on a Sunday, the brokers' association was previously permitted to temporarily suspend operations on that day and reschedule the forward trading to the 15th. This has already been announced to the market. However, this morning, off-exchange forward trading occurred, which constitutes behavior that intentionally disrupts the market, as stipulated in Article 50, Item 1 of Chapter 12 (Penalty Provisions) of the business regulations. It is also equivalent to violating this exchange's articles of association, business regulations, other regulations and instructions, and the brokers' association's bylaws, as stated in Item 2. In addition to notifying the brokers' association to immediately hold an emergency meeting to strictly prohibit this practice and to investigate the broker(s) who initially disrupted market order today, further action will be taken. This announcement is hereby made."</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tightness Eases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. However, large silver bars appreciated, while silver prices contracted. Overseas telegrams indicated no changes in the Indian exchange rate, calculated at 54 rupees and 375 units. There were also no increases or decreases in Yokohama and Kobe. Market conditions were mediocre. In the local market, internal bids for foreign exchange eased from tight conditions. The premium initially surged but then declined. By the afternoon close, compared to the previous day, both shillings and US dollars had leveled off, while Japanese yen slightly decreased by 0.125. However, the difference between March and June forward rates was more than half a percentage point. Chinese merchants' speculative trading was scarce because the forward trading date was approaching, and the May premium had already opened. There were reports of banks such as Netherlands, Anta, and Huayi absorbing three to four hundred thousand pounds that had been offered, and interbank trading involved tens of thousands of pounds. Only a small amount of US dollars was sold, while only several hundred thousand yen were offered, which were purchased by Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Taiwan, and Zhengjin. The afternoon trading was particularly quiet. Furthermore, due to disturbances in the market related to premiums pre-opening for forward trading, buying and selling became even more stagnant.</p>
<h3>US Silver Contracts, Large Silver Bars Appreciate</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, the spot price of large silver bars remained unchanged, at 19 pence and 25 units. The forward price continued to increase by 0.125, to 18 pence and 9375 units. China was buying, with small transactions, and the market was flat. A New York telegram reported that the price of US silver had contracted by 0.125, to 41.625 cents. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar increased by 0.125, to 46.15625 cents. The exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound rose by 0.125, to $4.863125. The exchange rate between the Japanese yen and the US dollar remained unchanged, at 49.375 yen. The exchange rate between the British pound and the Japanese yen rose by 0.03125, to 2 shillings and 0.034375 pence. The British pound and Shanghai shilling exchange rate fell by 0.03125, to 1 shilling and 11.8125 pence. Furthermore, at 10:10 AM, a Reuters telegram reported no increases or decreases, with the Japanese yen and US dollar exchange rate at 49.3125 yen and the British pound and Japanese yen exchange rate at 2 shillings and 0.034375 pence. A Den-tsu news agency report also indicated no gains or losses.</p>
<h3>Overnight Interest Rates Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>Market Overview: For several days, due to scarce transactions, the market has been sluggish, prices have been quiet, and the situation has been indecisive. At this time of the spring equinox, in past years, there would have been potential for development. However, this year, because the native banks once experienced difficulties, they are now mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, unwilling to rashly forge ahead. This has led to a quiet market, despite the potential for significant development, which is regrettable. However, bank settlements are comparable to last year, indicating that they are unrelated to the recent native bank crisis.</p>
<p>Overnight Interest Rates: The morning "foreign interest rate" was 72.0375 thousandths, and the annual rate was 2.5 thousandths, with only a 1.25 thousandth difference between the morning and afternoon rates. "Silver interest rates" for both morning and afternoon sessions for transferring silver were uniformly at 6 thousandths, a slight improvement of 1 thousandth compared to the previous day. Bank-listed rates showed no significant market activity, with only 2 to 3 thousandths of added premium.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market: The market for Jiangnan small silver dollars was generally flat, with little competition and minimal price changes. Both the morning and afternoon sessions were at 61.45 thousandths, a 0.25 thousandth improvement compared to the previous day's morning session. Trading volume was 6,000 dollars in the morning session and 4,000 dollars in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver dollars were at 59.7 thousandths in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Trading volume was 215,000 dollars in the morning session and 30,000 dollars in the afternoon session. It was generally heard that there was a slight source of Cantonese coins, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 dollars. Copper coins were at 390,000 cash, a 4,000 cash increase compared to the previous day. Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" - Yesterday, bank inflows and outflows were limited. Chinese merchants' settlements were over 1.9 million, foreign merchants' were 1.3 to 1.4 million, telegraphic transfer funds were over 400,000, and various exchange taxes and miscellaneous escrow funds were over 7 million. Warehouse outflows were 800,000. Japanese banks' settlements were 2.4 to 2.5 million, with warehouse inflows of 400,000. Native bank and silver guild settlements were over 22.5 million, clearinghouse settlements were 2.4 to 2.5 million, various exchange settlements were over 1.3 million, and cash receipts were tens of thousands. "Foreign Funds" - Foreign exchange and draft settlements were 1.13 million in the morning session and 540,000 in the afternoon session. Banknotes were 10,000 in the morning session and 23,000 in the afternoon session. Off-exchange banknotes were 84,000 in the morning session and 42,000 in the afternoon session. Bank transactions were 450,000 in the morning session and 500,000 in the afternoon session. Over 1.1 million was received and disbursed for foreign accounts of various banks, with banknote inflows and outflows exceeding 2 million. Native bank foreign currency clearinghouse settlements were over 3.2 million, foreign currency clearinghouse settlements were over 900,000, and foreign currency borrowing was over 1.5 million. Due to the significant volume of bank drafts being received and disbursed, borrowing increased accordingly. Transactions involving small native banks' banknotes and remittances totaled over 600,000.</p>
<h3>Securities Stable; Bond Market Trend Remains Stable</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The opening price of the forward 9/6 bond in the morning session was 167, falling to 165.25, and closing at 168.5, with a volume of 950,000. The opening price of the forward 7-year bond was 76.25, closing at 75.8, with a volume of 10,000. The 6/3 bond was at 65, with a volume of 5,000.

<h3>Securities Exchange Opens Auction of Troop Reduction and Reorganization Bonds</h3>
<p>Only spot trading opens... No market for futures... Other bonds stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities exchange opened the auction of troop reduction public bonds and reorganization treasury bills for spot and futures trading. Both types of spot bonds opened in both the morning and afternoon sessions, but there was no market for futures. As for the trading of other bonds, the spot market was very quiet, and the futures market was also slightly calmer. The bond market was stable, with little difference between supply and demand. Except for a change of about one yuan in the long-term Reorganization Customs bonds, others fluctuated by only about half a yuan. The 7-year 9/6 bonds fluctuated even less. As a result, there were mutual increases and decreases. The financial spot bond rose by 1.7 yuan compared to the beginning of the month, and the continued bond rose by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. Other bonds changed by only a few cents. The total spot volume for the day was 14,000 yuan, and the futures volume was strong in the morning session, totaling 4.22 million yuan. In the afternoon, it suddenly became scarce, with only 2.68 million yuan, totaling 6.8 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Steps Softly</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and the situation is softening. Rumors are spreading about the current situation, and people are feeling weak. Sellers are taking the opportunity to pressure prices downward. Sales are somewhat stagnant. Although some merchant groups are interested, they are temporarily holding back due to the unfavorable market conditions. Business is slightly lacking. However, the Tianjin merchants are still actively purchasing.</p>
<p>The selling pressure in the standard yarn market is high. The market opened with a slight drop in American cotton and rumors about the current situation. The selling pressure was higher in the market, and there was a lack of buyers. Prices for all months fell by 5 to 6 cents. Transactions in the market were also limited. In the afternoon, the market sentiment remained soft, and there were very few buyers. Prices for all months fell by another 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents. The total volume for the day was 10,150 bales. The closing prices for the standard yarn are recorded below:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>
<p>March 155.1 Down 0.7 31,000 June 153.1 Down 0.8 22,900</p>
<p>April 153.9 Down 1.0 42,900 July 153.0 Down 1.0 21,050</p>
<p>May 153.2 Down 1.0 32,400 August 123.0 Down 1.0 14,450</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn were slightly weak. Various merchant groups bought 1,800 bales, and fellow traders took in 800 bales. Prices were flat. Among the merchant groups, the Tianjin merchants had the largest volume of purchases, totaling 560 bales. In addition, the Guangdong merchants took in 495 bales, Ningbo 35 bales, Hankou 75 bales, Sichuan 175 bales, inland areas 140 bales, Jiangxi 110 bales, miscellaneous groups 140 bales, and factories opened 300-400 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Lacks Vitality</h3>
<p>Yesterday, telegrams reported a softening of American cotton prices and an even steeper decline in Indian cotton prices. Local cotton merchants' sentiment softened, and many were selling to take profits. Only the Hankou merchants persisted and refused to release their holdings. Actual sales on the market were even less frequent, with no news of any sources. Factories are exclusively purchasing Indian cotton. The future of the cotton market is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Decline by Two Cents: At the opening of the Hankou standard market in the morning, prices fell with the decline in foreign cotton, and the situation was sluggish. Prices for all months fell by 1.5 to 2 cents. In the afternoon, near-month prices rose slightly, while far-month prices continued to be weak. Increases and decreases were around 0.5 cents. The total volume for the day was 19,300 dan. The Hankou standard closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory</p>

<h3>Reports of Reduced US Cotton Acreage</h3>
<p>New York, 13th: The telegram reports on the US cotton situation, stating that limit orders from traders are more numerous, and actual raw cotton demand is slightly stronger. Exports and consumption are both favorable for the short side. Private sources report that cotton acreage has slightly decreased, and domestic fabric trading is sluggish. The main force influencing the cotton market is the USDA's intention.</p>
<h3>US President Proposes Allocation of Funds for Agricultural Subsidies</h3>
<p>Totaling 100 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>Passed by the Senate</p>
<p>Washington, 12th: The United States, regarding the maintenance of agricultural product prices, has been researching various strategies through the Federal Farm Board, but without significant impact. Cotton and wheat remain low. President Hoover submitted a $100 million agricultural subsidy bill to the Senate, which has been passed.</p>
<h3>Grain and Wheat Market, Futures and Spot Both Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the rice and wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices were slightly sluggish in all months due to the smaller volume of imported wheat. However, sellers of near and far months did not flood the market. Bulls ultimately picked up cheap buys, and far months were considered distant. Although the weather was good, it was not enough to drive the market significantly. Therefore, the fluctuations were minimal. As in past years, the future new wheat market is likely to soften. As a result, the current month was down 0.02 compared to the previous day, April was down 0.01, July was down 0.01, and there were no other changes. Spot wheat trading was active, and prices were slightly lower. If the quality of the subsequent shipments is not good, prices may still need to increase somewhat. The opening prices were 5.16 taels per package for Suzhou wheat, 5.15 taels for Qingjiangpu wheat, 5.04 taels for Yangzhou wheat, 5.12 to 5.1 taels for Shaoxing wheat, 5.02 taels for Jiangxi wheat (lower quality down to 4.8 taels), and 5.12 to 5.045 taels for Gaoyou wheat. A total of 4,500 packages were offered, purchased by Fufeng and other factories.</p>
<h3>Primary Cause of Stagnant Flour Market</h3>
<p>Imported Wheat Prices Continue to Decline</p>
<p>Tianjin Merchants Liquidate Futures Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for all months trended toward stagnation again. This was due to the continued decline in imported wheat prices, which dampened market sentiment. As for sales in the north, the Yingkou merchants bought over 10,000 packages in the morning, so the current month showed some stability. However, in the afternoon, because the Tianjin merchants had already purchased spot goods, they slightly liquidated some futures positions. Therefore, prices for all months were slightly softer than in the morning. The prices for far months were also slightly softer due to the sunny weather. Looking at the future situation, because there is ultimately a surplus of imported wheat, the local flour market is likely to fluctuate within a range. As a result, the current month was down 0.0075 compared to the previous day, April was down 0.005, May was unchanged, June was up 0.0025, July was down 0.005, and August was down 0.005.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Rises by 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Futures Rice Up About 0.01 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market saw another change. After three new ships arrived, merchants from Jiangbei and other inland areas actively purchased rice, and prices immediately jumped by 0.2 yuan. Futures rice saw limited supply and high demand, and prices rose in response. Traders from inland areas also paid attention to far-month rice, and both near-month and far-month prices rose by about 0.01 yuan per dan. The prices were 14 yuan to 13.93 yuan for 6,000 packages of No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon rice, 14.6 to 14.4 yuan for 4,000 packages of No. 1 rice. Jiafu rice was newly arrived, and due to the lack of high-quality, medium-quality, and low-quality rice, 5,000 packages were offered at 13.35 yuan. 10,000+ packages of futures Saigon rice were offered, with No. 1 road cargo at 14.28 yuan, No. 2 at 13.75 yuan, 30,000 packages of small-sized rice with road cargo at 13.63 yuan, and 6.08 to 6.05 yuan for March/April, 2,000 packages of large-sized road cargo at 12.95 yuan.</p>
<p>The imported rice market has been volatile lately. Prices tend not to weaken before road cargo arrives. Once new goods arrive, prices rise sharply. The reason for this surge is that various groups compete to purchase the goods once they arrive.</p>
<h3>Northern Goods from Two Gates: Candied Dates Market in Decline</h3>
<p>Candied dates sold for 26-27 taels in early spring, but have since declined. Recently, the decline has accelerated. As the weather warms, there is a risk that the quality of these sugared confections will deteriorate. In the current sluggish market, prices must decline. Yesterday, top-quality candied dates were selling for less than 20 taels, with slight increases for lower grades. The Lanxi goods were even weaker and seemed to be in irreversible decline.</p>
<h3>Hardware Company's Iron Sales Are Strong</h3>
<p>Recently, 200-pound Lamei brand iron has been in high demand due to the shortage of 90-100 pound English and American tinplate. The strong sales have surpassed previous levels. Yesterday, 700-800 boxes were offered. As there is no expectation of a rebound in foreign exchange rates, prices are quite strong. American Kang brand sold for 19.5 taels, Fengyu brand for 20 taels, Mitsui brand for 18.75 taels, Weili brand for 18.5 taels, and miscellaneous brands for 18.5 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Chinese Silk Continues to Be Exported</h3>
<p>Previously, local European firms had temporarily halted silk exports due to the decline in the exchange rate of shillings, etc., and the low overseas silk prices. The export of Chinese silk was thus stagnant. Now that the exchange rate has strengthened and the Yokohama Japanese silk prices have risen, European and American silk prices have gradually trended upward. Furthermore, as British and American postal ships are successively exporting goods, exporters are dividing their existing silk inventory into batches for export. In addition to Anli and other firms shipping 250 pieces of Chinese silk on the British postal ship Alipore to British Bombay today, Ganli, Lan Lebi, and others will ship 600 pieces of yellow, white, and gray silk on the American postal ship Pias to Seattle tomorrow. This has also activated silk sales to Europe and America. Yesterday, there was a telegram reporting from Shanghai that Ganli and others were importing 60 packages of medium-grade Shanghai factory silk and 50 packages of gray silk, with strong prices.</p>
