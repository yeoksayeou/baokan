<h3 id="c28">歐美經濟之内外關係 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>世界破壞和平之危機。關於政治意味者少。而關於經濟意味者多。以國内政局言。財政愈困難。各方之責備益苛。政府之處置益難。爭至無法解决時。則惟有如德國解散國會之一法。然解散之後。反對黨之積怨愈深。糾紛之問題愈多。而財政上之難關。亦且愈積愈甚。據今日倫敦電。英人預料本年秋季。全世界之經濟狀况。將視今日而更形急。迫苟如所料。則斯時之各國政爭。必益加甚。而政局不安之狀態。更不知將陷於何種景象矣。以國際大勢言。財政愈困難。則防人侵略愈甚。向外發展之心亦愈堅。而關稅競爭。遂成爲無法避免之事實。如今日歐美兩大陸。各以重稅相對抗。美則疑歐陸以經濟聯盟對美。故以新稅則爲抵抗之工具。歐陸各國。則疑美以新稅則挑戰。故亦欲增高稅率。以示報復。然重稅非盡與巳國有利。或且益陷商業於不振。故歐美兩大陸。雖各欲以此相抗。而其實自身亦無限之苦痛使果堅執此政策以往。則此後世界之貿易前途。更將不堪收拾矣。</p>
<p>故此二者。實爲經濟上最大之危機。此後各國政黨。能屏除一切别種作用。而以誠意與政府合作。么挽救財政。則國内政局之糾紛。或可稍减。歐美各大國。能屏除敵對之機心。排去一切縱横捭闔之政策。而各以誠意商經濟上之合作。則國際問破裂之危險。亦可稍减。昨美國特發通電。聲明此次發表之新稅則。美總統尚有伸縮權。他國如感不便。儘可要求修正。殆亦覺悟敵對之非策。而有就商轉圜之意歟。倘歐陸各國能就此時會而亦捨棄其報復之念以誠意與商挽救方法則誠减少危機之一大機緣也。</p>

<p>主席蔡孑　民致開會詞略云今天是中華職業敎育社第十一屆社員大會、中華全國職業敎育機關聯合會、第八屆年會和舉行中華職業敎育社新社址落成紀念典禮、本社在民國六年黄任之先生參考美國菲列濱職業敎育大受剌激、覺得我國受敎育的人、都是學非所用、不能適合他的職業、那時便竭力提倡職業敎育、而組織本社、並同時開辦職業學校、當初創的時候這職業敎育比現在說得未免過於愼重、所以引起了很大的反響、這敎育系統、當初在意大利和法國祗有四科、如神·醫·法哲·文理二科也屬於哲學、五六百年前、大學祗有神、醫·法三科、而以哲學爲預科、後來才獨立爲敎育科、皆是爲職業而設的、所以謀敎育系統、原是爲職業還有品格人格的修養、在日本以爲中學校是養成普通人格所以專門技能的課程對於己有職業的人設立補習學校以給予補習的機會補習普通敎育系統中所沒有的、本社考察社會和職業的需要就能力之所及、開辦職業學校、予將服務或己服務工商界的人準備以補習的機會、并辦職業指導所、農村方面在崑山徐公橋鎭江黄墟等處辦理改良農村的工作、很有成效、這是本社可以安慰的但因人才缺乏、和經濟困難的關係不能把要做的事完全實現、所以把全國的職業敎育機關聯合起來、有聯合會的組織、這也是本社十三年以來、努力的結果、講到國民黨的三民主義是著重於民生主義、在民生問題沒有解决未達到理想的世界、人之安樂的時候、我們便要救濟失業、一個人不能得着生活、便要做壞事、所以一定要解决、我國大多數的人、都是想求職業的或者是己經得到了職業而沒有本領去做另一方面、是有事而找不到適當的人去做、這便需要職業敎育去敎給他們本領、使得能做事有飯吃、培養人才、便社會上有得用這個責任很重、所以本社要努力進行、才能完成任務、今天在社員大會中、由辦事部主任報告社務由全國敎育機關聯合會主席報告會務、希望大家予以指導</p>
<p>馬相伯致詞　略謂列子中有云一齊有國士、宋有相士、國士富而相士貧、相士至齊詢國士以致富之術、國士造之曰致富在盜、相士遂返國行盜不久敗露被囚乃詰國士國士因謂之曰、金玉財貨爲私有物不可盜、天下之公物、方可盜、」我爲科學就是盜、和齊國國士的盡相同也、所盜的是天下之風雨露水、他能利用汽水力電力說到人人應否都有職業、我以爲一個人不能自活不能養自己的就是盜人人應該有養自己的力量並且要自養養人中國人好閉關自守在帝制時代、社是在皇帝面前變戲法、事事皆祗是個人的、沒有大衆的、所以中國是個人的國其實國家是人民的世界上無論大小的東西、都是人類十指所造成的天生人是要做職業的美國人什麽人不做生活便不應該吃飯、不准吃飯、眞對人民要做人、便要有職業、能做職業、才不負天地生人之恩人人能有這樣職業的精神、民國才可以發達、所以發達所以我們要職業的精神有進步、不要像害黄疸病似的人民、要爲國家種族同類謀福利這纔是眞正職業、眞正的人道</p>
<p>鈕錫生演講詞　略云、職業敎衣很爲重要、在國中人民如無職業、即等於無民、故必以互助之精神、以謀彼此共同生存事業、纔可成功、小之一身一家、大之國家、天下的事業、纔都可以做起、如果沒有職業、如何能發展、所以大家要　地工作、以解决種種問題、本社在以前人們所不注意的時候、見到職業敎育的重要而工作起來、以得今日之成功、這是有佩服的價值的、現在在大家都巳知道、職業敎育的重要更應進一步的努力使不但要解决職業、還要解决敎育、以造成世界人類偉大的事業、請在座把職業敎育的重要、擴大宣傳、以達成功、中國生計、就在此一線</p>
<p>辦事部報告　主任江問漁報告及全國職業敎育機關聯合會值年主席中央大學農學院王丞報告、另詳從略、</p>
<p>敎部顧蔭亭致詞略謂、國民政府注重三民主義敎育、三民主義着重於民生主義、在在與職業敎育有關、這是須待專家討論的希望職敎社加以研究、以供參考、敎育部擬在最近編訂家事科課程、希擬訂以促其及早訂成敎育之範團甚廣行政機關不能全盤顧到希望能供給材料此外個人有點貢獻、（一）外國職業敎育中心、在職業補習學校、在訓練下級的實業人才、以切實用、我們也要以此職業補習敎育爲中心而出發然後才有希望（二）中國以農立國但普通學校都未加以注意、所以本社應在農業敎育注重能辦好、學生的出路甚多、（三）女子治理家事、各國皆然本社應特别注意討論以供行政機關之參考、（四）職業指導、各國皆特設機關、或專員司之其重要可知、本社已設有此種機關、此後更應努力進行、</p>
<p>楊杏佛致詞　略云從古以來、沒有不做工而吃飯的人、但何以現在不做工而吃飯的人這麽多、就可以想到做工而吃不到飯的人又有多少、如不把此問題解决、民生主義就沒有迷到目的所以我們提倡職業敎育就是提倡吃飯敎育、在現在工業機關　逢的時候、更不論　人、就是受過敎育的中流以上的人也、都　該做些農工、以實現民生主義中國俗話說「各人自掃門前雪、休管他家瓦上霜、」我今改爲「各人自産衣食往、休管他家美善眞、」人人如能自食其力、這才是眞美善、所以我要注重業不用注重職、</p>
<p>市黨部代表致詞　毛君略謂中國過去敎育有三種缺陷、一機會不平等、二貴族的三敎材爲古典或深奥的、因此平民不能受到敎育、所以我們要使農工都能有敎育、非提倡職業敎育不可三民主義的民生主義、注重在實業的建設、勞工保護職業敎育有了成績、人人便皆有所養、所以現在極力提倡這種敎育、是適合中國社會的實際狀况、補助民生主義的進行、以達終究目的云、</p>
<p>林康侯演說　略謂、人有兩個手固然可以做事、但要有業給他做、外國的業、是很發達的、但是在中國業是逐漸减少的於是一天一天的多起來、因而有手也無法動、所以我們要想如何把業發展、應先提倡三育、</p>

<p>丨連負三盤丨</p>
<p>中華對明治之雙打、陣綫與原定略異、中華林寳華臂傷、代以鄭兆佳、明治大藤倉亦因受病、替以相良、而江道章與小藤　倉仍出塲應戰、江鄭技藝、固　上乘、但雙打首重合作、不幸江鄭正犯不合作而受打擊也、前之二盤、江鄭未始、不有轉勝之餘地、何奈三番四次、處之失當、大好良機、頓成烟雲、令人懊傷、最後一盤、勢、成强弩之末、雖有大力、無能爲矣、如林出塲、得江之助、勝之易如反掌、蓋對方實力、亦無甚特色也、三盤比較、四比六·四比六·三比六·江鄭失敗、裁判員徐振東、</p>
<p>功虧一簣　球影飛舞之初、江道章憑全身實力、向前猛攻、形勢兇惡、乃防守不愼、反受敵擊、因此連負二局、第三第四兩局、江鄭得心應手、殺擘並施、一時敵人披靡、勢如破竹、頓成三比二之超越、氣勢旣轉正宜乘此一帆風順、直達成功成三三相等局面、第七局轉戰甚烈、幾度平數、卒遭敗　、而第八局又爲敵人捷手先得、比數反以三比五落後、江賴猛烈之供球、爭回一局、然不久再遭失敗、卒以四比六失第一盤、</p>

<p>大學組分單打兩組雙打一組、結果單打各勝一組、雙打勝負未决、鄭兆佳余田光年少英俊、誠爲吾國網球界後起之秀不啻美國少年愛力生與文賴因、昨日與明治岡本及小私二人比賽、競爭十分劇烈、難兆佳最見出色、第一盤共賽二十二局方定高下、明治以十二比十勝、是盤鄭余原有取勝可能、後因超之過急而致失利、殊爲可惜、第二盤鄭余以八比六報復時天色己晚、不能續戰、遂和局而終、兹將各組經過、記之如</p>
<h3 id="c94">戰打···勝負各一 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>單打第一組爲余田光對瀨尾、兩盤即分高下、余以稳靜之態度、猛力之抽球、結果以六比一、六比四得勝、</p>
<p>第一盤　瀨尾先發球、余田光奮勇還擊、全勝一局、瀨尾謹愼挑戰、亦勝一局、嗣後田光球勢極順、對方雖用猛力之抽球、余則從容還擊、屢有建樹、如青雲直上連下五局、以六比一告捷、觀是盤中、科態度頗稳、惟錯誤尚多、是因經騐不足故耳、</p>
<p>第二盤起初堅持不下各有建樹各二三局數後、瀨尾曾以三比二占優、而後余田光聲東擊西球忽遠忽近、使瀨尾不暇奔命、余遂又以四比三超勝、是兩局中、相戰甚烈余屢居下風、卒能挽回殘局、轉敗爲勝、良非易事、而瀨尾亦不示弱、造成各四平手、余乃再接再厲、卒以六比四再勝、</p>
<p>第二組單打爲沈美鎭對相良結果沈連負兩盤、比數爲○比六、三比六、第一盤沈美鎭失分甚多、相良則應付應如、連獲六局、毫不費力、第二盤、相良復乘勝餘威、繼續猛力襲取、連下三局、沈見勢不佳、急起反攻、奪回一局、未幾相良又以四比一占先、沈亡命圖報、追上兩局、無奈球藝軟弱、難挽殘局、相良遂又以六比三勝、</p>
<h3 id="c95">雙打···局而終 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>單打比賽終了、即爲雙打大學隊鄭兆佳余男光甫經劇烈之戰、繼續又與明治岡本及小松兩人比賽、明治組以逸待勞、固先己占得便宜、然一對少年英雄、血氣方剛、豈肯示弱、雙方努力奮門、軒輊難分、結果各得一盤、因天晚和局而終、</p>
<p>第一盤登場交鋒、鄭余先勝一局、小松與岡本招架得法、連得二局、旋成各二、鄭兆佳藉發球之功夫、反以三一占優、嗣後余田光略有慌亂之態、球少把握、加之對方之攻勢甚猛、竟連負四記、乃成三與三比、局勢旣平雙方競爭愈烈、鄭兆佳時有極佳之表演、與余田光頗有聯絡、而明治組亦極兇猛、不稍鬆懈、此後相提並進、勝負難分你一局、我一局、互相追隨、各不相讀、然鄭余二將、屢居優勢、未能一鼓而下、嗣後反以十比十一失利適輪至明治組岡本發球準急有力、全獲四記、遂以十二比十勝第一盤、觀此比賽、競爭之烈不言可知、共費時間一小時餘、亦屬難得、</p>
<p>第二盤　暮色茫茫戴衆球興未　　足而觀、小松與岡本對鄭余二將、亦正打得興高采烈難解難分、明治組連下二局、聲勢浩浩、然鄭余豈肯甘休、小心　戰、奮力進攻、斯時作戰愈烈、形勢緊張、鄭余二將志在　復、對方之球勢雖兇亦能應付裕如、二人並善用　總、　使明治組顧此失彼、疲於奔命、鄭余乃迭奏奇功、以三比二反敗爲勝、此後又成相持不下之勢、比數由三比三而至六比六、始終不分軒輊、嗣後鄭余宛如困獸之門、精神忽見大振、連得兩局、而以八比六告捷、時己萬家燈火、雙方戰將、亦己精疲力竭、乃和局而罷、</p>

<p>孫籌成</p>
<p>月之十六日。中華國産聯合大商塲舉行開幕典禮。業誌次日本報。兹將見聞瑣屑。錄送自由談。想亦提倡國貨者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>來賓均得贈品是日會塲在南京路市政廳舊址樓上大議事廳。設來賓座位三十六排。每排能坐三十人。壁上遍貼「提倡國貨可以挽回利權。」「努力國貨運動。」「提倡國貨是解决中國民生問題」等標語。空中懸掛黨國旗數百面。來賓簽名後由招待員導之入席。并贈以三星棉鐵廠毛巾一條。中國橡皮廠人造牙篌一雙。冠生園西點一包。</p>
<p>總理初次光臨市政廳爲公共租界外人辦理政治之處。我國同胞足跡罕至。内部布置。悉係歐化。是日禮堂上高搭一台。上懸都錦生絲織廠所織之總理全身遺像約長四尺。穿中山裝。旁掛黨國旗成交叉形。鄰座某君謂此地係十八國共管租界之議事機關。向無總理遺像。今日能懸繡像於台上。可謂總理初次光臨。卷者捧腹。</p>
<p>張子廉謙讓異常　此次所組之國産聯合商塲。係三星廠經理張子廉所發起。一面向房主哈同租定房屋。一面分請熱心國貨者擔任徵集設計宣傳各股委員。分頭進行。是日張君報告籌備經過時。歸功於各團體各同志之贊助。以及各廠商之熱心參加。乃有如是成績。并謂請到會諸君詳加指導。庶得秉承意旨。力圖進行。語頗謙遜。</p>
<p>王延松語有經騐　王延松是日代表市黨部致詞時。除詳述外貨充斥。若不提倡國貨。必致利權外溢。噬臍無及等語外。并謂南京路係上海商業最繁盛之處。在此組織國産聯合商塲。爲外人觀贍所繫。應格外謹愼。務望參加之各廠商。對於貨品。須選新鮮合時。價廉物美者。陳列銷</p>

<p>美報載美國婦人部部長魯濱孫女士。發表談話一則。言近來美國工廠或商店。每不肯雇用年長女子。凡年在三十以内者。始有獲得職務之希望。若年過四十而欲謀事。實屬毫無希望。此種風氣盛行一時。至若年在六十以上。雖身體康健。技術純熟。亦必無人雇用。又自各工廠合併及機器製造紙烟以來。婦女失業者頗衆。凡欲謀得位置者。必隠瞞其年齡。否則雖有經騐技能。亦往往向隅云。</p>
<p>售。切不可將存貨充數。致失主顧之熱忱。王君係大新綢緞局老班。洞悉商情。所言確係經騐之談。人皆悅服。</p>
<p>孔部長登台低頭工商部孔祥熙部長是日親自蒞會致詞。登台時因扶梯上面所有之玻璃窗。裝置太低。渠體貌魁偉。如挺身而入。必且碰頭。乃由招待員請其低頭上梯。渠遵命登台。笑容可掬。演說時除述國産之發達與否。有關國計民生外。並謂此次所組之國産商廠。深得孟子所謂天時地利人和三優點。希望自此推及全國。以挽利權云云。</p>

<p>黄寄萍</p>
<p>浙敎廳長陳布雷氏。一夕與余等會宴於黄樹芬氏寓。彼態度謙和。不失新聞記者本色。於整理浙省敎育之計劃。侃侃而談。頗多切要。復詢戈氏以上海報界現狀。蓋猶未忘情於其昔日之生涯也。席次談及寗杭公路。此路跨江浙兩省。由兩省建設廳主辦。歷時年餘。業將告成。陳氏謂曾與張靜江主席同乘汽車。自寗返杭。路頗平直。祗橋梁尚未竣工。不久正式可通車。竊惟溧陽宜興一帶。匪氛不戢。旅客恐不免裹足耳。</p>
<p>余在杭數日之觀察。深覺絲綢業失敗後。商業大受打擊。而失業者衆。社會頗呈恐慌現象。杭城向以産綢爲大宗。金融藉以流通。民生得以舒展。近年絲廠相繼破産。織工均遭失業之痛。杭城人力車夫十之六七爲昔日之織工。某車夫爲余言。彼等業織工時。日可獲廿餘元至四十餘元。瞻一家。尚有餘裕。今則奔走終日。僅謀一飽。其言至哀也。考絲綢業失敗之因。（一）苛捐雜稅之重徵。（二）織物不知改良。（三）人造絲暢銷。（四）國人競尚洋貨。觀此則政府。絲商。與民衆。均負一部分之責任。關心實業者。鑑於綢業之失敗。亦知設法補救否。</p>
<p>離杭之前一晚。亞細亞步行團某君。謁戈氏。報告滬杭間步行之經過。據云「自滬至杭。沿鐵道而行。每日少則五十里。多則百廿里。閱六日而抵杭。在嘉善附近。曾爲路警所阻。出示護照。方准通過。將至嘉興時。天將晚。遇喬裝農人之匪徒數人。出兇器恫嚇。搜索備至。所携八十五元。盡被奪去。後告以步行宗旨。哀求發還半數。充途中食宿之需。商之至再。始給以零數。飛奔而逸」。黄君頗幹練。謂團中男女同志。誓不婚嫁。此行期以六年。可返故鄕。其堅忍之意旨。與壯烈之精神。誠難得也。</p>

<p>自金價暴漲後。致以銀爲本位之我國商業界。竟大受其影響。今將見聞所及。擇要書之如下。</p>

<p>此外專事紀錄電影戲劇音樂者有東京演藝通信。國際映畫通信等。供給時事照片及銅版者有日刊寫眞通信。新聞聯合社。電通社。及時事寫眞速報社等數家。日報中最負盛名者爲東京日日新聞蓋大阪每日新聞之支店也。其每日銷數在東京報紙中佔第一位。去年元旦突破一百萬份之紀錄。迄於今日。最高點達一百十一萬份。其次爲東京朝日新聞。蓋大阪朝日之支店也。日銷數十萬份。再次爲時事新報。資本年百二十五萬圓。國民新聞資本三百萬圓。中外商業新報。資本二百萬圓。報知新聞資本一百十萬元。社長爲大隈侯爵。爲民政黨機關報紙。東京爲日本新聞業發祥之地。歷史較久。大抵均在六十年左右。最古者爲東京每日新聞。創刊於明治三年。（距今六十年）係個人經營。資本五十萬元。因根基稳固。頗有相當地位。但其後因東京之生産力遠不若大阪。遂使大阪朝日與每日勃然興起。歷倒先輩。復以其經濟勢力。漸次向外擴充。初大阪朝日新聞社長村山龍平氏。於明治二十一年開始經營東京朝日新聞。與大阪朝日成爲犄角。互消息。未數載。東西朝日之聲咸大振。其後大阪每日勃興。但頗感孤軍無援之苦痛。積極在東京物色謀與合作之報紙。明治四十四年二月將東京日日新聞實行收買。復加以銳意改革。面目一新。東京日創刊於明治五年。在社會本有聲譽。經大阪每日之培養。至於今日遂一躍而居首席。故談東京今日之報紙首推東京日日與東京朝日。而實際仍爲大阪每日與朝日之競爭。日本全國與論悉在兩報掌握。亦誠足以自驕矣。至新聞學術方面。東京實爲中心點最著名者有新卷究所。專門從事新聞記者之訓練。出版物有新聞及新聞記者。（日刊）日本新聞年鑑等。復根據國際新聞專家會議。增高新聞記者之敎育。於去年十月一日在東京帝國大舉内創設新聞研究室。以文學部法學部經濟學部敎授負責指導由三部中各選學生三名。從事研究。研究之材料偏重於新聞之歷史。及國外新聞之調查等。以一年爲期。預料成績定有可觀此外各社關於新聞之出版物有廣告論叢。新聞年表。新聞與社會。萬國出版關係法規集等數十種。日本新聞事業之發展。前途正未可限量也。</p>
<p>汽車所用之汽油。（即俗稱戤士林者）其每加倫之價。由五角五分漲至六角。繼而爲八角五分。近則售一元一角餘矣。然據西人勞白欺談。謂是項汽油之成本甚廉。惟以轉運故。乃達如此鉅價。前美孚行曾調查中國各省。以四川之油田爲最佳。倘加以科學之提煉。其質爲目下各牌所不及。本擬設廠於蜀。因遭反對而罷議。當余（西人自稱）遊川時。目見是地之人。均掘地取油。藉助燈光之需。如此大好寳藏。中國竟無人起而開採。以供國人之需求。實屬可笑之至。噫。華人之經濟日趨於恐慌。雖大半由於内亂。然逐日坐失巨大漏巵。要亦其中一因也。</p>
<p>近日報端屢見各種國貨漲價之通告。觀其語氣。莫不由於原料之增價。然其旣名國貨。則其原料亦當産自吾國。若國内本已有者。則宜設法改良之。無則亦當調查全國各地。有無是項原料。如有。即着手開採之。無則亦必設法。將是項原料。代以其他種種。如此方不受他人之挾制。而金價之漲跌。亦無甚關係。深願經營國貨諸公。及早注意此點也。</p>
<p>外人愛用國貨心之熱切。實非華人所能企及。兹錄一事證之。借以警惕國人。滬上郵務局之局長。其先爲某國人。在任時。凡所需之物。均爲其本國所産。後易另一某國人。到局後。即逐漸改用其本國之物品。雖一鋼筆頭之微。亦必更之而後快。國人讀此。其可憬然悟矣。</p>

<p>那個品茗處。。却並沒有什麽貴婦淑女。在那裏盡義務。。還是張園的幾個老茶房在那裏承值。因爲晚上還有燄火等餘興。。在那邊草地上燃放。因此在這裏啜茗者很多。本來啜茗的地方。是在安愷弟的。現在安愷弟。已成爲各種游戲之場。所以把啜茗的地方。移到這邊草地上來。特别裝了五色的電燈。掩映於密樹叢林之地。。尤顯得燦爛可觀。龍紫耘和左詩晨到這裏來時。。却見啜茗的人巳坐滿了。。鬢影衣香。珠喧玉噪。。幸虧還有一個空虚。。加着那個茶房是認得左詩晨的。便道。。左先生。這裏坐吧。。再遲一刻。連這個座位也沒有了。左詩晨等只得坐下。原來是一張活動的桌子。。上面又舖上一條白布桌衣。横七豎八安上幾張籐椅子。茶房們便去泡上兩壺茶來。往日的茶。。一壺可以兩個人共飮。。今天却規定每人一壺。。無非要敎茶客多泡幾壺。多出幾壺。。多出幾個茶資而已。。坐定了。。龍紫耘便問茶房。。今天不是有燄火嗎。。茶房道。有的。。所以此地如此熱鬧。。龍紫耘道。燄火快要放嗎。。茶房道。總要等到十一點半。。早放了。。人家看了燄火。。便散去了。。所以遲一點的好。今天有一種東洋特别燄火。。非常之高。到了天空中。。方始放出五色的星球來。。······那個茶房正說得起勁的當兒。。左詩晨忽聽得背後有個笑語聲音。好像是是很熟的。。這時龍紫耘已經注意到了。。向左詩晨低低說道。。在你後面的一位。穿了一件鸚哥綠衫子的那人。。不是好像蕊雲嗎。。左詩晨疾忙回過頭去。。果然是蕊雲。。只見他們有六七個女人。。團團地坐了一圓桌。。好像開了什麽圓桌會議似的。。這裏頭四十多歲的中年太太也有。。十三四歲的小姑娘也有。。其他十六七十八九的女郎。和蕊雲不相上下的。。的有四五人。。大家都是有說有笑的。。當左詩晨則過頭去的時候。蕊雲也早已看見了左詩晨了。。瞧伊好像呆了一呆。。連忙避開了左诗晨的目光。和傍邊一位盛　覆額。。梳了一條辮子的女郎。在笑着說什麽話了。及至左詩晨不看伊時。。伊又在偷眼　着左詩晨的背後影。。左詩晨沒有看得。。但是和左詩晨對面坐的龍紫耘却看得很清楚咧。。正是</p>

<p>來賓致詞　金山縣長陸權氏、述此次陳區長接事後、即將金山大股之土匪、派警會同陸軍勦征、得以竄散、故代表金山民衆感謝並希望繼續努力云云、又上海縣黨部代表及金山縣黨部代表並警備司令部軍需處熊處長等、均有演說甚多、</p>
<p>陳氏答詞陳區長致答詞云、今日承各長官在炎熱天氣光臨、彌深感歉、澤寛奉命來任此職、業巳多日今日始補行宣誓就職典禮者、因就事之初、金山即發生大股匪患、澤寛先自出巡、並派艦隊往勦、一面請得陸軍協助、兹巳撲減、惟覺數十年來水警積弊太深、殊少紀律、故擬着手訓練、以成勁旅、俾易剿匪、兹巳向民政廳條陳三事、（一）設法交通之便利、（二）設法通訊之迅速、（三）設法運輸警隊之敏捷、一俟批准即可實行、此後當仰副省府注意剿匪之計劃而努力行之、</p>

<p>電車昨開十二輛</p>
<p>法當局戒備嚴密</p>
<p>法商水電工潮擴大、已誌本報兹悉該會昨日下午、又開大會、情形分誌於下、</p>
<p>大會情形　昨開大會、原仍假公共體育塲嗣因時間延至三時、遂在該工會舉行、市黨部派張煇年·朱亞揆·代表出席指導公安局飭警維持、全體工友八百餘人、由徐　梅主席、行禮如儀、報告車務部加入罷工以後、工會工作、極其緊張、資方雖仍倔强、毫無覺悟、然全體工友、因車務部工友加入援助、不啻新添生力軍、對於奮鬥精神、異常勇往、當抱不屈不撓之旨、以求貫澈云云、嗣又報告、今晨有車務部代表三人、向大會要求、關於公司今天開出電車、請工友不必有所舉動、當代向公司詢問條件、即經該三人、前往咨詢云、</p>
<p>擴充工作　該工會原有之罷工委員及糾察隊、皆係機務部工友推出、兹以車務部工友加入後、應行擴充、以便積極工作、兹悉車務部推定穆小山·孫愛棠·趙金齡·王田三·楊道清五人爲罷工委員、王炳林·郭文彬·王學仁·徐阿四·王寳發龔金坤·李貫一·張連生·彭學少·李貞嚴十人、爲糾察隊云、</p>
<p>華員援助據徐阿梅云、此次罷工期内、華方高級職員、其初尚無所表示、今則亦以此事延長不决、亦擬慨然加入、與工友一致行動、華方職員、果能一致加入後則公司方面、近方在收賬期内、外間賬欵多至十數萬、定將發生影響、而工友勝利亦可預卜、</p>
<p>車輛減少　法水電公司内全部車輛共有五十六、昨日所開、祗有十二輛、計由徐家匯至十六舖之二路車八輛、由盧家灣至十六舖之十路車四輛、設如續有毁損、則今日車輛、恐愈將減少、</p>
<p>擴大後援此次罷工期内、市黨部方面、竭其全力、爲之援助、六十餘團體組織之後援會、兹以後援實力、尚恐不敷、故已决儘量擴充、以促早日解决云、</p>

<p>公司新工　公司方面、所招白俄、人數並不甚多、惟雇用時、曾訂有合同、故雖工人復工、此項俄人、可不致發生問題、至於新招之華工、現下亦有二百餘人之多、惟對於工作方面、並不熟諳、故車輛未能完全修理、因此之故、公司方面、頗渴望老工人之復工、然大率格於義憤、不肯加入、</p>
<p>捕房戒備　法租界當軸、昨日戒備、愈形嚴密、每一電車上、必有華越捕各一、拖車　輛華捕一人、凡電車駛經之各要口、且有法捕越捕坐自備汽車武裝游巡、盧家灣總公司一帶、更覺嚴重、魯班路一帶華租交界之　、　綱密布　　一人通行、武裝義務探員、亦有多人分守各要隘、以防意外、其他老北門等處之鐵門一律關閉、東新橋等處、則亦惟留一門、以通往來車輛云、</p>

<p>第四十七章　亞美利加的小說</p>
<p>馬可脫温是全亞美利加作家中最獨創底最深廣的亞美利加人、豪厄爾兹稱他爲亞美加文學的林肯、在他的知識、他所消化所思索的知識、他對於亞美利加生活的多種多樣相的理解之範圍、沒有别的作家可以和他相比較了、他生於那是中央西部而且一半南部的密蘇里州、在加里福尼州住過一晌、在紐約及康揑狄格住過多年、他旅行全世界、知道一切種類的人們及其境遇、以爲他的翼被剪斷、亞美利加生活的尊嚴使他的天才不能十分流露云云、這一種近來於年青的批評家之間流行着的觀念毫無什麽意味、沒有什麽作家更加適於介紹自己所住的國、沒有什麽國有過爲介紹本國準備得更加舒齊的作家、他說了他應說的一切、他懂得說出牠來的方術、而周圍的事情是培育他的天才的、</p>
<p>他作爲新聞記者發跡於内華達及加里福尼、作爲諧謔家博得了地方底名聲、他的報紙派遣他爲游歷歐羅巴及聖地的通信員、他的通信便成着他那最初重要的「海外的阿木林」了、這不是滑稽書、這有着不少的可笑味、那諧謔有些不免淺薄、然而大都是誠實的、獨自的眞摯的觀察和實際經騐的報告、眞切的節段是以優秀的散文寫的、他在有些節段發見了、當他年長起來、成着更明哲更反省底之際、隨伴以發達的美的意識、比他更好的旅行通信員不曾有過、他的銳眼看穿了一切、他有將或一塲景理解、並且通信的生就的天才、這特殊的才能是在後期的「海外旅行」及「跟着赤道」之中被證明的、　　小說上他的傑作是「赫克爾培利芬」這在他的作品中孤立着、因爲「托漠沙尤」是和牠不成比較的、雖然並無批評底知識的馬可脫温似乎對於那小作品較之大作品倒更爲愛好、「赫克爾培利芬」在亞美利加文學中也孤立着、在塲景的範圍、在故事底興味的多樣是沒有和這相似的東西的、倘若單將博大想一下、則這在世界的文學中却沒有孤立着、因爲至少也有一部稱爲「吉訶德先生」的放浪和冒險的偉大的諧謔小說可以相比、「赫克爾培利芬」不只是僅僅少年的故事、而且雖然年青的讀者對於這、像愛讀着「葛利佛的旅行」、不知那深意所在似的愛讀着、這也不是給兒童看的書、經由赫克的天眞的眼、我們看見文明全體（或文明所缺的東西）、我們獲得在美國的歷史的中心的、那國地理底中心的幾乎叙事詩底眼界、在馬可脫温的輕快的作品中、有不少的可笑味、有對於人物的銳利的觀察、然而也有制作上失手似的不平均、焦躁的性急的形跡「愚鈍的威爾遜」的價值差不多全部在於馬可脫温繼續用作别書的篇章的標題的「曆」之中、在於曾經吐露的最銳敏最壯麗的警句之中、在算是一種小說的「貞德」中有許多的美和持久的品位、然而一切之上最好者（次於赫克爾培利芬）是兩篇諷剌小說、「使哈特里褒墮落的男子」和發表於他的死後的奇妙的寓話「不可思議的陌生人、」馬可脫温有着像斯尉夫特的辛辣似的、雜以哀憫的、深沈的斯尉夫特式的辛辣、往往他笑得最響亮時也最殘忍、「在亞搭爾王的宫廷的康湼狄格的洋岐」、皮相上是帶着諧文的風味的有些發鬆的笑劇、但在根柢、這却是民主主義的研究、是對於人類的愚劣的猛烈的攻擊、就在那裏、馬可脫温表達出全人類可處絞刑這一個願望來、</p>
<p>他是有那可驚的指辭之才、痛烈的憤激、和愚弄所憎惡的東西這一種令人戰慄的手腕的偉大的小册子作者、忽視了他屢次發表的抗議的論文的讀者是失却他那最雄壯而可稱讚的樣相之一的、馬可脫温的可笑味有許多漸至失却生氣了、這也許是事實罷、有的非經他那别的作品維持生命、是曇花一現而有被忘却的運命的、然而眞摯的馬可脫温却是不亞於同世紀任何散文作家的確實不朽的古典、當他如在「密士失必河岸的生活」似的、並無什麽因襲底文學形式的干涉、直接講述自己的心意時、他是文體的巨匠、他是我們的民主主義的桂冠散文家丨丨關於民主主義的所有的事物、恐怕他都會說的罷、</p>
<p>在一面、即加里福尼底一面、和馬可脫温有聯絡的是布勒忒哈特、他爲娱悅東部海岸的讀者起見、開發了西部海岸的開拓者的生活、而且他幹得很出色、他的賭博者和礦工是被感傷化了的、他似乎從迭更司的天才的最有缺陷的部分有所學得、然而他却寫了優美的散文、他知道短篇小說的藝術、而且他於接觸羅曼底情緒這事情是巧妙的、他極其多産、他的作品大部分巳經被忘却了、然而「頗卡弗拉忒的流浪人」似的小說却還新鮮、他的一個作品、我相信不會被忘却的、因爲這是優秀的諧謔、是第一流間接的文學批評的緣故、那作品就是兩卷的「壓縮小說」、</p>

<p>賀玉波著</p>
<p>現代書局出版</p>
<p>在最近的文壇上、我們看不見使人值得留意的新作品、昨天我在圖書館裏看見了這册創作、頓使我無限飛躍輕清宛轉的筆底、描寫幾個凄婉的故事、這册東西我認爲滿意、</p>
<p>裏面是八個短篇作者的風格、很細膩颼光第一個是「同命鳥」裏面描寫一個年輕的學生、和妓女發生了戀愛、後來那學生窮途日暮、他鄕金盞遭了鴇母的白眼、那妓女却眞心愛他、後來那妓和鴇母爭執而自盡、同時窮愁潦倒、無路可通的那個學生病倒在醫院裏、在報上看見了這個消息、也和了死神擁抱、離開了現實的世界、</p>
<p>這篇東西對於現代青年的苦悶、性的發洩、呻吟在時代漩渦裏的人們表示出了深切的同情、當在桃色的夢被窮愁打破以後、巳往的樓臺突然幻滅、心頭怎樣自悔呢、那學生和妓女爭執出來踏上自己蕭索的寓居、有過自我的回想和肯定的懺悔、</p>
<p>窰子巳經不能算做人了、不過是反肉製造的機器她們爲了金錢、不得不假心對待客人、其實、也難責備她們、她們正像馬路上拉大車的騾馬一樣、只供他人驅使的、</p>
<p>嫖客好比大車上的貨物、窰子裏的掌櫃和領家就等於商人或資本家、阿姨媽子什夥等人、就是趕大車的夫役、這樣情形、嫖客那能像騾馬般的窰子身上得着些甚麽安慰呢、不過在大車上坐坐、不知不覺地替那種用婦女當騾馬的商人或資本家生了許多利潤、假設這種貨物沒有利潤可賺、他們也不得搬運了、</p>
<p>這段喻得十分切當、很可以使人認識娼門中的實在情况了、</p>
<p>第二個是離京、是離開京城時的離情别緒、同時將現代人的生活難盡情地顯露了、第三個是營長太太、軍閥的殘忍、軍閥是土匪、寫得很痛切、殺戮打刦、離散了年輕的未婚夫婦、强佔人妻、第四個是破産、社會組織的不良和軍閥給予人民水深火熱的痛苦、使活潑地青年、踏上了社會、謀不到良好的職業、好像一把殘忍的利劍、將好好的家庭、弄得零落萬分同時世態炎凉、人情冷暖、也給予了深深地同情、第五個是離婚後、這篇是鄕村小學敎師的戀愛、這篇得到趙景深這樣的批評、確是值得稱贊和驚嘆的、</p>
<p>趙景深在序一第三節裏丨</p>
<p>·我們如果拿「離婚後」來跟「營長太太」「離京」「破産」「她的消息」「自沈」「選舉」等篇來一比、更可大喫一驚、像「離婚後」這樣鄕村爲背景來描寫戀愛的小說、直可以和汪靜之「耶穌的吩咐」以及許傑的「鄰居」並美、無論在結構上、辭句上、都是很使人愉悅的、我們如果按作者的年月看來、便知「離婚後」得最近一篇、可知作者在技巧上實有突飛的進步、依這樣的進步比例下去、我想賀先生的將來是未可限量的、現在即使只有這一篇「離婚後」、巳經很使我們滿足了、</p>
<p>第六個「她的消息」他鄕作客、隔開了七年、舊地重臨、想起了當年、想起了當年與少女的戀愛、現在相隔七年、不知了她的消息如何、望着洞庭湖滔滔湖水、彷彿當年送别時的倩影、留下一道相思曲、情感的節奏、技巧的力量、給人共鳴的感應、</p>
<p>流水呀流吧、</p>
<p>流去了我的青春、</p>
<p>流去了我的戀人、</p>
<p>怎流不去我的憂憤、</p>
<p>怎流不去她的倩影、</p>
<p>流水呀流吧、</p>
<p>願流我到她的家鄕、</p>
<p>願流我到她的身跟、</p>
<p>許我瞧見了她、</p>
<p>我願長眠在你的波心、</p>
<p>第七個「自沈」是妓女自身的悲哀、和第一個同爲對于現今性慾的賣買表示了極眞的同情、第八個「選舉」這篇對不合理的代議政治終了一條致命傷、鄕村中土豪劣紳對於選舉的胡閙、持巧嫻熟極了、</p>
<p>小說旣不是事實的堆積、也不是僅用文字剌成美麗的　屏、是人生的藝術、這是不容否認的了、現今大多數作家、不是專們堆砌他們自己的浪漫史、便一心一意織造文字的錦緞、他們不知道作者對於一切事物應有偉大的同情、由此而産出正確的思想、纔能藉適當的文字而成美好的作品、</p>
<p>本書作者對於創作態度極爲嚴肅、認眞、誠懇的、這樣努力下去、將來可以有大成功的希望、</p>

According to the results of on-site investigations by Chinese and Japanese commissioners of the loss lists of all Japanese consulates and Japanese residents in Nanjing, some items were inconsistent with the facts, and some were now difficult to prove, leading to both sides being in the process of discounting and reducing the amount of compensation, making it difficult to resolve for the time being.

<h3 id="e9">Gold Export Ban <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Hu Dai and Others Draft Concrete Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the gold export ban issue, according to those familiar with the commercial situation, the amount of gold in our country is not small. However, a large amount is used for useless purposes such as women's jewelry, utensils, and the decoration of Buddhist statues, so less circulates in the market. Foreigners, because the price of gold in our country is not expensive, try to buy it. For example, each Japanese gold yen is equivalent to two or three qian of Chinese silver, and fifty gold yen is equivalent to sixty-eight taels of Chinese silver. In China, each gold bar is purchased for ten taels, and eighty taels of silver can be earned. Therefore, although the government prohibits the export of gold, those who violate the order and smuggle it continue to do so. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and Industry have completed the investigation of the domestic gold and silver situation and will submit it to the Central Political Committee for discussion. Currently, Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, and others are paying close attention to this matter and have drafted concrete measures based on the investigation materials of various responsible departments to remedy the situation.

<h3 id="e27">The Internal and External Relations of European and American Economies <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The crisis of world peace is less about political implications and more about economic implications. Regarding the domestic political situation, the more difficult the finances, the more harsh the accusations from all parties, and the more difficult the government's handling. When disputes become impossible to resolve, the only option is the German method of dissolving parliament. However, after the dissolution, the resentment of the opposition party deepens, the number of disputes increases, and the financial difficulties continue to accumulate. According to today's telegram from London, the British anticipate that the global economic situation this autumn will be more urgent than it is today. If this is the case, the political struggles in various countries at that time will inevitably intensify, and the state of political unrest will be unknown. Regarding the international situation, the more difficult the finances, the more vigilance against aggression and the more determined the desire to expand outward. Tariff competition has become an unavoidable fact. As seen today, the European and American continents are confronting each other with heavy taxes. The United States suspects that the European continent is forming an economic alliance against it, so it uses the new tariff as a tool of resistance. The countries of the European continent suspect that the United States is challenging them with the new tariff, so they also want to increase tariff rates to retaliate. However, heavy taxes are not entirely beneficial to one's own country and may further undermine commerce. Therefore, although the European and American continents each want to resist each other in this way, they are actually suffering infinite pain themselves. If they firmly adhere to this policy in the future, the future of world trade will be even more unmanageable.</p>
<p>Therefore, these two are the biggest economic crises. If political parties in various countries can put aside all other considerations and cooperate with the government in good faith to save finances, the domestic political disputes may be slightly reduced. If the major powers of Europe and America can put aside their hostile intentions, remove all policies of manipulation, and cooperate in good faith in economic matters, the danger of international rupture may also be slightly reduced. Yesterday, the United States specifically issued a circular stating that the US President still has the power to be flexible with the newly released tariff, and other countries can request amendments if they feel inconvenience. This is perhaps a realization that confrontation is not a good policy and there is an intention to negotiate. If the countries of the European continent can seize this opportunity and abandon their retaliatory thoughts, and sincerely discuss ways to save the situation, it would be a great opportunity to reduce the crisis.</p>

<p>Anti-Communism Advances to Anti-Socialism. The Soviet Government Sends a Note of Protest</p>
<p>National News Agency, Helsinki, 19th - The leaders of Finland's Lapua Movement, after personally leading farmers to the capital to petition for the expulsion of the Communist Party, have now gone a step further by issuing a declaration urging the country not to allow saboteurs to vote in elections to prevent the Communist Party from taking the opportunity to infiltrate Parliament, and solemnly declaring that, in any case</p>
<h2>Page 6</h2>
<p>The Lapua comrades are determined to prohibit all performances and actions of those with different political views.</p>
<p>Another telegram - Finland's Lapua Movement has hitherto focused solely on opposing the Communist Party, but is now expanding its scope and beginning to oppose the Socialist Party. Mr. Hakkila, the mayor of Tampere and Finland's most famous socialist member of parliament, was suddenly kidnapped into a car by armed Lapua comrades this morning, and his whereabouts are still unknown. The Finnish Interior Minister has now agreed to the Lapua comrades' request and ordered the prohibition of all Communist Party meetings and propaganda before the general election.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 19th - The Soviet Russian government has sent a note to Finland in extremely strong terms, protesting the recent series of acts of violence on the border and the Finnish authorities' expulsion of a large number of Finnish people and trade union officials who are inclined to the Communist Party into Russian territory, demanding that the Finnish government re-investigate thoroughly and punish the responsible Finnish officials.</p>

<p>Enthusiastically Received by the People. The German Political Situation Suddenly Becomes Tense. Various Countries Comment</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 19th - German President Hindenburg is touring the Rhine region. Today, he first arrived in the old town of Speyer. The local people were exceptionally happy. Prime Minister Brüning was unable to accompany him due to the political situation.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 19th - Italian newspapers have commented extensively on the German political situation. A stable German government is related to European peace and happiness, so close attention should be paid to it. The opinions of the newspapers all despise the incompetence of the German parliament and praise President Hindenburg's ability to cut through the Gordian knot decisively. Their words express the color of the棒喝 party.</p>
<p>Same day, London telegram - British newspapers are commenting on the dissolution of the German parliament with considerable caution, as the British political circles did not initially expect this political crisis to occur in Germany. The result of the general election is likely to strengthen the forces on both the extreme right and left wings, making it more difficult to form a stable government. There are many reasons for this, especially the economic difficulties, making it difficult to take action in everything. Moreover, it is predicted here that the global economic situation this autumn will be more urgent than it is today. Same day, Paris telegram - French newspapers are paying close attention to the German political situation, but most newspapers have not dared to express their opinions freely. A number of newspapers are deeply concerned that the German general election is taking place at the time when Geneva is discussing Briand's plan for a European Federation, which will reduce Germany's effectiveness in participating in the discussion. Other newspapers fear that the general election law will greatly weaken the forces of those in Germany who are seeking political stability.</p>

<p>Multiple Reservations Proposed</p>
<p>Yesterday's Vote Again Failed</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - It is again rumored that the London Naval Treaty will be passed in the Senate special session this afternoon or evening, but today's special session only adjourned in the evening after the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Borah, proposed a resolution to support ratification of the treaty. It is said that the committee will vote on the proposed treaty reservation proposals when it meets next Monday. Senator Bingham proposed amending the naval treaty during today's meeting, stipulating that if the powers increase their tonnage after due notice, the United States will be free to build 8-inch gun cruisers. This proposal was met with a chorus of objections and was dismissed. In addition, Senator Moses' proposal to amend the reservations to restrict submarines and unarmed merchant ships was also rejected by the meeting. Senator Walsh also advocated a resolution that should be recorded in the Senate's records, namely that the United States must build naval preparations as much as possible according to the highest limitations of the naval treaty, and stated that he intended to vote on this proposal before the ratification vote, because it was rumored that peace advocates across the United States were helping the treaty become a reality, and planned to oppose the necessary funding for building ships in the future. Before the Senate discussed the eleven reservations today, the chairman ordered the full text of the naval treaty to be read out article by article. The meeting initially expected that after the reservations were completed, the full text of the naval treaty could be voted on tonight, but ultimately it was unable to fulfill its wishes due to time constraints.</p>

People in Copenhagen view this as a joke. In recent years, there have been repeated rumors of this kind, which have always been firmly denied by the authorities.</p>

<p>Not Discussed at the Naval Leaders Conference</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 20th – The Naval Leaders Conference convened at 9 AM today to discuss the scope of the issues to be discussed by the informal advisory council. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM. The content of the draft response was not discussed. It was decided that the informal advisory council would discuss everything. The draft content includes: (1) The naval strength that Japan is allowed to maintain under the treaty has definite shortcomings; (2) These shortcomings should be supplemented, and the three major principles of Japan should be implemented at the 1935 conference. The government is concerned that acknowledging the term "shortcomings" will raise issues of government responsibility, so it hopes to call them "insufficient." The attitude of Naval Minister Takarabe on this issue is drawing the most attention.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Sharp Decline in Japan's Trade Surplus <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Decline of the Shipping Industry Deepens</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th – Japan's foreign trade surplus in mid-July was 4,331,000 yuan. The total deficit since the beginning of the year has been reduced to 216,585,500 yuan. Although the reduction in trade is a global phenomenon, the situation in Japan is worsening more than in other countries, which deserves attention. Cotton imports increased by 1.6 million yuan compared to the previous ten days, while raw silk exports decreased by 1 million yuan. The raw silk market has already shown signs of recovery and is unlikely to reverse into a surplus. The surplus for each ten-day period is significantly less than last year.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th – The decline of the shipping industry is becoming increasingly severe. This month, 150,000 to 160,000 tons of ships were laid up. Once the North Pacific fishing season is over, it is expected that the number will reach 1 million tons by the end of the year. Even the laid-up ships cannot sustain themselves and there is a tendency to allow creditor banks to dispose of them freely, which is causing great concern among the banks, and they are studying countermeasures.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Resolution of the Suyu Canal Dispute <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The counties of Fengxian in Jiangsu and Yutai in Shandong are adjacent. The waterways of Fengxian have historically flowed through Yutai into Nanyang and Zhaoyang Lakes. However, due to silting and conflicting interests, disputes have been continuous for hundreds of years, leading to repeated械鬥 (xie dou - armed clashes) and tragedies. During the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty, the governors-general of the two provinces dispatched senior officials to conduct a joint survey, and a negative solution of Feng not digging canals and Yu not building dikes was agreed upon. As a result, whenever there was continuous rain in autumn, the two counties of Feng and Yu suffered floods, and the losses were uncountable. In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the magistrate of Fengxian, acting on the order of the Ministry of Interior to develop local water conservancy, immediately convened local gentry and resolved to levy labor to dredge the North-South River. A river over a hundred miles long was completed in a few weeks, and their spirit of勇往直前 (yong wang zhi qian - advancing bravely) set an unprecedented record. However, because Yutai's consent was not obtained in advance, the people of Yutai felt a great disaster was about to befall them, and both sides summoned their county's forces to dig trenches and fight, confronting each other as if facing a formidable enemy. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, fearing that the prolonged deadlock would lead to major changes, repeatedly sent personnel to conduct joint surveys and discussions with the Shandong Provincial Committee in the past two years, and proposed subsidizing Yutai for construction costs to connect the downstream, but Shandong has an established case and a proper solution has not yet been reached. After Director Sun of the Construction Department and Director Mao of the Water Conservancy Bureau took office this time, considering that there were many outstanding cases between Jiangsu and Shandong, and Jiangsu and Anhui, if they were not resolved as soon as possible, the water conservancy plans would be restricted and could not proceed. Therefore, they immediately appointed Xu Ji, director of the Water Conservancy Department, as a member, together with Wang Fengxi, an engineer from the Huai River Conservancy Commission, and Zhang Junsen, a member of the Shandong Construction Department, to first hold a meeting in Nanjing to determine the survey outline, and then went together to the border between Jiangsu and Shandong to conduct a field survey, and convened people from the border areas of Feng and Yu to earnestly persuade them, and inform them of the advantages and disadvantages, which gained the sympathy of the people on both sides. Four methods were decided upon: opening the east-west branch rivers downstream of Yutai, the border ditches connecting Fengpei and Yu, and the branch rivers within Fengxian, with each responsible for their own work and no subsidies provided. This case has been submitted by the Huai River Conservancy Commission to the Executive Yuan for approval and finalization. The Executive Yuan ordered the two provinces of Jiangsu and Shandong to instruct the two counties of Feng and Yu to implement the plan. The century-old dispute has been resolved overnight, which is truly a blessing for the people of Feng and Yu counties.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Xu's Headquarters Convenes Bandit Suppression Conference <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou correspondence, Xuzhou Campaign Director He Yaozu, believing that there are many bandits near Xuzhou and that joint defense and suppression are urgently needed, scheduled a conference of representatives from the eight counties of Tongxiao, Fengpei, Dangpi, Suishu, and Suixian in Xuzhou and Suixian in northern Anhui on the 18th, designating two representatives from each county, one as an administrative official and the other as a团警 (tuanjing - local police) commander. All representatives reported in advance one after another. When the time came, He went to the western front to visit Chiang Kai-shek and was ordered by Chiang to fly to the Pinghan Railway for inspection, so he was unable to return to Xuzhou. The meeting was chaired by Chief of Staff Zhan Zhenhuang. The opening ceremony was held in the conference hall of the headquarters at 1 PM that afternoon. Deputy Chairman Zhan, Chief of Staff Wang Taiqi of the headquarters staff office, Xuzhou Garrison Commander Song Runtian, and Bandit Suppression Commander Fan Zichun of Fengdangxiao three counties were present. Representatives who signed in from each county included Chen Yuanquan from Pipi County, Wang Hualan and Wang Enpu from Dangshan County, County Chief Yang Liang of Feng County, Police Captain Zhu Dudian, County Chief Xu Enzhao of Pei County, County Chief Yang Wei of Tongshan County, Representative Wang Xiaoyi from Suixian County, Liu Yihua, head of the People's Self-Defense Corps, Du Guangchen and Jiang Qiaosheng from Suqian County, Huang Jingru and Zheng Yunqiao from Xiaoxian County, and Zhu Bichen, representative of Suining County Chief Wen Qinming. The meeting proceeded as planned, and the representatives reported in turn on the bandit situation, suppression situation, military strength, and self-defense organization in their respective counties, and expressed their opinions on joint defense and bandit suppression. The meeting adjourned at 4 PM. The next morning (19th) at 10 AM, the representatives of each county held a discussion meeting in the conference room of the Tongshan County Government, chaired by Yang Wei. Du Guangchen and Jiang Qiaosheng from Suqian, Wang Hualan and Wang Enpu from Dangshan, County Chief Yang Liang from Feng County, County Chief Luo Yuanye from Pipi County, County Chief Xu Enzhao from Pei County, Huang Jingru and Zheng Yunqiao from Xiaoxian, and Zhu Bichen from Suining were present. Fan Zichun was also present. The representatives exchanged opinions, collected proposals, and discussed the results, compiling and submitting five proposals: (1) Request the formation of a joint defense committee for the eight counties of Xuzhou; (2) Request the headquarters to submit to the Chief Commander a notice to all armies not to recruit bandits; (3) Request the headquarters to replenish the counties with guns and ammunition as much as possible; (4) Request the issuance of secret code telegrams; (5) Request the addition of military law to the counties to govern bandits. The meeting adjourned at 12 PM. Director He has returned to Xuzhou from the western front on the morning of the 19th and will convene a formal meeting tomorrow. The representatives will submit five proposals, and the headquarters will decide on the methods. The reporter recently visited He and talked about the conference issues. He said that the proposals must first be collected and sorted out. The meeting will be convened roughly tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, depending on the complexity of the matter. It should be completed in about one or two days. After that, the most important thing for bandit suppression is local self-defense, which is a permanent solution. According to Wang Taiqi, director of the staff office, according to the reports of the representatives of each county, the bandit forces are scattered and their whereabouts are uncertain, but the military strength of each county is estimated to be about 30,000 to 40,000 guns. With proper coordination, it is not difficult to completely eliminate them. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Formation of Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps in Eastern Jiangxi <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Yaohua's Brigade Arrives in Fuzhou</p>
<p>No Traces of Bandits in Le'an and Nanfeng</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence, the two districts of Fujian and Jian in eastern Jiangxi border western Fujian. When Zhu Mao attacked Guangchang from Huanjin and Shicheng some time ago, there was an attempted occupation of Fuzhou. Fortunately, it was blocked by the警備團 (jing be tuan - local guard). The bandits Lin Biao, Li Shaojiu, and Duan Yuequan retreated to Shicheng on the Fujian border and Yudou and Xingguo in southern Jiangxi. Nanfeng and Nancheng were preserved unscathed. Later, because the Jiangxi bandit leader Fang Zhimin captured Jingzhen (now withdrawn), the警備團 (jing be tuan - local guard) was transferred back to the province and departed for Raozhou. The local defense was filled by Zhu Yaohua's 54th Brigade, which was transferred back to western Jiangxi from Hunan by Chief Commander Lu. Currently, the brigade has arrived in Chongren and Le'an, advancing to suppress the bandits of Li and Duan on the Fujian border and in Yongfeng and Xingguo. In order to unite the twelve counties of Chongren, Lincuan, Jinxi, Yihuang, Le'an, Dongxiang, Nanfeng, Nancheng, Lichuan, Guangchang, Zixi, and Shicheng in Fujian and Jian, and concentrate their efforts, an Anti-Communist Joint Defense Army of Eastern Jiangxi was specially organized. Representatives of the counties met in Fuzhou and decided to establish the headquarters of the Joint Defense Army in Lincuan, because Lincuan is an important town in eastern Jiangxi, with long-distance telephone lines, connecting in all directions, connecting to the provincial capital and Jiujiang below, and to Nanfeng above, and to Zhangshu and Ji'an in the west. County Chief Wang Zhenhuan of Lincuan was elected as the Bandit Suppression Commander, responsible for liaison, dispatch, and command. It is reported that the靖衛隊 (jing wei dui - local defence force) of Lincuan, Nancheng, Yihuang and other counties are quite strong, and the Joint Defense Army has about 3,000 to 4,000 guns, stationed in important passes as a deterrent. The provincial government received a telegram from Wang Zhenhuan yesterday, stating that the suppression of the local bandits in Qiacun, Nanfeng, has been discussed with Nancheng and Yihuang counties to be handled according to the original plan, and the defense of Nancheng and Yihuang is assisted by teams dispatched from Lincuan. The bandits were defeated in the morning, and they are being tracked down. Zhang bandit in Le'an is now fleeing to Niutian, about eight miles away from the county. All other counties are peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Hunan Province Organizes Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Changsha correspondence, in recent months, due to the military incidents in Hunan Province, bandits and communists have sprung up in various places, such as Liuyang, Pingjiang, Yueyang and other counties near Changsha, which have been repeatedly captured. The number of people who have been brutally killed and looted in various places is countless. Those who are fortunate enough to escape are displaced, and deaths follow one after another. As for burning houses and robbing property, that's another matter. Now that the military situation has fortunately come to an end, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route He Jian has, in addition to pursuing the remnants of Zhang Guijun's army with the main force, has also transferred a portion back to suppress the bandits and communists. However, due to the vast area and the spread of bandit forces, it is quite difficult to pursue them now. Recently, the people of various counties have automatically organized Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps for the sake of self-defense, to supplement the insufficient strength of the army. Commander-in-Chief He believes that this kind of organization is extremely helpful in eradicating bandits and communists, and has approved the organizational regulations of the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps, and instructed on the work that the Volunteer Corps should have, and urged them to proceed. It seems that with the cooperation of the people and the government, the eradication of bandits and communists in Hunan Province will be easier than before. The organizational regulations are recorded as follows: (1) The people of Hunan are anxious to seek self-defense due to the rampant Communist bandits, and have automatically organized Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps. (2) If the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps belongs to the occupied area, it shall first be composed of able-bodied young men (over 18 years old and under 40 years old) among the refugees. Those who evade shall be treated as colluding with the bandits and punished. When the area is recovered, it shall be drawn from each household. (3) The captain of the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps shall be publicly elected by the entire team and shall have the full power to统事 (tǒng shì - manage affairs) and command the team. (4) After the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps is organized, it may manufacture spears by itself, and when necessary, it may apply to the government for permission to purchase guns. (5) The Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps shall mainly assist the army in the work of eradicating the communists and strive to consolidate the rear, and when necessary, the General Headquarters may send personnel to guide it. (6) Before order is restored in any area that has been occupied by bandits, the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps may take emergency measures when encountering important communists or their organizations. (7) The rations for the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps shall be donated by those with more wealth among the refugees. (8) Those who are wounded in the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps may be sent to local public hospitals for treatment without taking any fees, and the deceased shall be compensated by public discussion. (9) Except for the emergency measures permitted for communists or their organizations, the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps shall refer to the "Aihutuan" regulations (挨戸團 - neighborhood mutual defence league) for other matters. (10) These regulations shall be submitted to the Fourth Route General Headquarters for approval and implementation, attached with the work of the Communist Eradication Volunteer Corps: (1) Designating and capturing communists, because they are local people, they know all about the local communists, so they can designate and capture them. (2) Searching for communist hideouts, local people also know where communists are hiding, and can avoid involving innocent people. (3) Detecting bandit traces. When the communist bandits are being suppressed by the large army, they often break up into smaller groups, and local people can easily detect their traces. (4) Strictly setting up sentry posts. No one is allowed to pass through without a pass, day or night, so that foreign bandits cannot sneak in. (5) Strictly registering, re-registering household by household. Those who do not have a registration certificate are not allowed to stay, so that domestic bandits cannot hide.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Lu Dipin Reports on Bandit Suppression Situation <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Entire Province Divided into Fifteen Bandit Suppression Zones</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence, Jiangxi Governor Lu Dipin reported on the bandit suppression issue at the provincial government's memorial week meeting, mainly stating that the magistrate of Ningdu County reported that he had uncovered a communist party organization and seized its plans. The Communist bandits Zhu Mao believed that when Zhang Guijun sneaked into Hunan, major changes would occur in the Yangtze River, so they wanted to take Jiangxi with all their strength. At the same time, the Peng bandit Dehuai spied on northern Jiangxi, and the Huang bandit Gonglue captured Jishui. However, Zhang Guijun was not worth a blow, and the Communist bandits' plans were shattered. Zhu Mao was battered by the Guangdong army on the Guangdong border this time, and Huang Gonglue attacked Ji'an and was killed by Deng's division with more than a thousand casualties, and Huang was also seriously injured and escaped. Although there were small groups of Communist bandits besieging Ganzhou some time ago, they were defeated by Ma's brigade (12th Division). The Peng bandit recently harassed northern Jiangxi and was defeated by Wang's brigade and Zhu's regiment and fled to the Hubei border. Currently, small groups of Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi have retreated to Yudu and Xingguo. Their intention is nothing more than to join forces to attack Ji and Fu or to capture Fuzhou, but Ji'an has Feng's division stationed there, and there are more than three brigades stationed in Fuzhou and Xingan. In northern Jiangxi, there is the entire 53rd Brigade and Chen Lei's regiment, and one supplementary regiment. The provincial capital has the 警備團 (jing be tuan - local guard). The various bandits of Zhu Mao, Peng Huang would definitely not dare to try easily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to eliminate bandits and communists in various counties, the provincial government has specifically divided the entire province into fifteen zones, with one commander in each zone, commanding the 靖衛隊 (jing wei dui - local defence force) of each county, and jointly suppressing the bandits, so as to unite as one. The county names belonging to each zone are listed as follows: Zone 1: Guixi, Yiyang, Hengfeng, Qianshan, Shangrao, Guangfeng, Yushan. Zone 2: Poyang, Fuliang, Leping, Yugan, Yujiang, Wannian. Zone 3: Lincuan, Jinxian, Dongxiang, Jinxi, Chongren, Le'an, Yihuang. Zone 4: Zixi, Nancheng, Lichuan, Nanfeng, Guangchang. Zone 5: Shicheng, Ningdu, Ruijin, Huichang, Yudu, Xingguo. Zone 6: Anyuan, Xunwu, Xinfeng, Longnan, Qiannan, Dingnan. Zone 7: Ganxian, Dayu, Nankang, Chongyi, Shangyou. Zone 8: Lianhua, Yongxin, Ninggang, Suichuan, Anfu. Zone 9: Ji'an, Taihe, Wan'an, Jishui, Yongfeng. Zone 10: Shanggao, Yifeng, Yichun, Pingxiang, Wanzai, Fenyi. Zone 11: Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Xinyu, Xingan, Xiajiang.

<h3 id="e53">Conflict Between Wuhu Customs Superintendent and Municipal Office <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Donation Office Sealed</p>
<p>Wuhu correspondence, the Wuhu Municipal Office created the Municipal Donation, which is collected as an additional tax on import and export goods at the Hai and Chang Customs. For the convenience of assessment and collection, it was agreed with Li Gengchang, the superintendent of the Wuhu Customs, to set up an office in the bank collection office of the Hai and Chang Customs, and entrusted the Central Bank to collect and store the donation money. It has been several months since then, but for some reason on the previous day (16th), Superintendent Li suddenly announced the withdrawal of the office building, ordered the municipal office's tax collectors to move out immediately, and issued a notice to merchants together with the Tax Affairs Department not to assist in the collection of donations. At the same time, it notified the Central Bank not to collect the donation money on its behalf, causing the municipal donation to be suspended immediately. The use of municipal donations, in addition to being used as expenses for the municipal office, also subsidizes the expenses of educational and charitable organizations. In addition to immediately telegraphing the province for instructions, the municipal office also notified the Relief Society and educational institutions, declaring that the municipal donations were being hindered and the customs office should be responsible. Yesterday, Superintendent Li sent guards to forcibly drive out the municipal tax collectors because they had not moved out, and nailed the office with tin sheets. As a result, the city's educational institutions and charitable organizations were panicked due to the impact on funding, and held meetings to discuss countermeasures. Charitable organizations held a meeting at the municipal office yesterday and resolved that Superintendent Li was disobeying provincial orders, hindering municipal donations, and affecting charitable undertakings. In addition to submitting reports to party and government agencies to fight for their rights, they also directly wrote to Superintendent Li to raise questions. The Municipal Education Association and the Relief Society held a reception for the press last night at the First Spring to ask for justice. The fair price committee also held an emergency meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon because the two-cent附加 (fujia - surtax) to level out rice prices was also stagnant, and resolved to write to Superintendent Li, requesting that he unseal the office immediately. However, the various groups only know that the municipal office is collecting funds, but the repair of the Guanma Road is perfunctory, the streets are becoming increasingly dirty, and beggars cannot be accommodated. It is planned to take this opportunity to urge improvements. Since this incident, the municipal office has reported to the provincial government and various departments by telegraph. It is rumored that Superintendent Li's actions were purely caused by a dispute over the交涉署 (jiaoshe shu - foreign affairs office) building. The Wuhu Customs Superintendent's Office was formerly attached to the Anhui 交涉署 (jiaoshe shu - foreign affairs office). After the 交涉署 (jiaoshe shu - foreign affairs office) was abolished, the buildings were managed by the municipal office by order of the ministry. After Li took office, he repeatedly asked the municipal office to hand over all the 交涉署 (jiaoshe shu - foreign affairs office) buildings, but the office refused, causing Li to take this action in anger. Today, Li also sent a letter to the municipal office, saying that municipal donations are local in nature. According to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the customs cannot assist and is not deliberately making things difficult, and it cannot be said that the municipal donations cannot be collected just because the customs office has taken back the building. The two things cannot be discussed together. This dispute may have to wait for the provincial telegraph to arrive in Wuhu before it can be resolved. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Obstacles to the Promotion of Guangdong Salt in Fujian and Jiangxi <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Publicly Set Up Checkpoints to Destroy the Salt Industry</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The coastal areas of Chaozhou Prefecture in Guangdong Province are rich in fish and salt. Shantou has a Chaozhou Bridge Salt Transport Deputy Office, which collects about 1.7 million yuan in regular taxes annually. Its salt sales areas are divided into Qiaoshang and Qiaoxia (referring to Xiangzi Bridge in Chao'an). Qiaoshang is divided into the three districts of Dama He and Xiaomei He, which are transported and sold to the hinterland of Fujian and Jiangxi. The average annual sales are about 560,000 dan (100 jin per dan), with a national tax of 5 jiao per dan. Qiaoshia is a salt-producing area, with a tax of 2 jiao and 5 fen per dan. On average, 70% of the salt produced in Chaozhou Prefecture each year is sold to Fujian and Jiangxi provinces, while only 30% is sold to the Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Dongjiang prefectures. This year, due to local unrest, bandits have set up their own checkpoints to collect salt donations, greatly undermining the salt industry. The people of Fujian and Jiangxi are increasingly lamenting the lack of salt. The following is a copy of the report submitted by the Chaozhou Bridge Salt Transport Office to the Finance Department of the National Government, to show the current situation. The report states: "Regarding the report, the Chaozhou Bridge salt transport has always been divided into two major areas, Qiaoshang and Qiaoshia. Qiaoshang is divided into the three districts of Dama He and Xiaomei He, which sell 560,000 dan annually according to the original comparison amount. Domestic sales account for only 30%, while foreign sales account for 70%. In recent years, due to local unrest, the Zhu-Mao communists have been harassing southern Jiangxi for years, constantly suppressing them, but they have not been wiped out. They have also infiltrated Tingzhou in Fujian, capturing Changting, Shanghang, Wuping, and Yongding counties, while Meixian and Pingyuan have also been affected. Local bandits everywhere have responded, burning, killing, looting, and doing everything. The mutiny of the Jinbu Zhou-Wei troops has also joined forces, increasing their strength and causing more harm. Taking the Dama He as an example, the sections occupied by the mutinous communist bandits have set up checkpoints along the river to collect salt donations, and local organizations have also taken the opportunity to extort money. From Shanghang to Changting, there are more than 20 collecting agencies. They have even kidnapped salt shop clerks and extorted huge sums of money. As a result, shopkeepers and warehouse managers have fled for their lives, shops have closed, business has stopped, and the salt stored in the warehouse cannot be sold within the bandit's sphere of influence. The salt that has not been transported is stalled in the lower reaches of the Han River. Taking the Xiaomei He as an example, Junmenling, Luotang, Wanwu, and Jitan in Huichang are important transportation routes, but soldiers and bandits come and go, disturbing the peace. Footmen are wary of the road, and transportation is cut off. Taking the Meizhou River as an example, Shekeng in Meixian is an important transfer point, but it has been occupied by communist bandits, who have led the masses to occupy Guantang, Shuiche, Xintang, Changsha and other places, robbing and killing. Last year, the salt warehouses of Yunshang Houchangji and other firms were moved, sold cheaply, and the clerks were shot and killed, and the warehouse workers were kidnapped, and they have not been able to resume business to this day. These are the situations in the three districts of Qiaoshang, which have been disturbed by the communist bandits, and the reasons for the obstruction of transportation and sales. The various transporters have repeatedly reported to the office, which has forwarded the reports to the Ministry of Finance and asked them to investigate and deal with the matter seriously, and has strictly ordered the transporters to earnestly promote sales and report shipments in a timely manner. Judging from the current situation, although the areas under the bridge are not peaceful, they are within the scope of Guangdong Province, and it is easier to consult with the defense army to suppress them. For sales, it can still be maintained. If there are no other changes and sales are effective, it is expected that there will be more than enough. However, the foreign sales areas above the bridge are all in the neighboring provinces of Fujian and Jiangxi, or are often occupied by bandits, or are occasionally disturbed by mutinous troops. The certainty of sales depends entirely on the effectiveness of the suppression. In addition to the Deputy Transport Officer's strict supervision of allocation and sales and reporting to the deployment for review, this office hereby reports the current situation of the devastated transport routes and sales areas being severely harassed by the communist bandits, and the reasons for the shortfall in sales, for review. We humbly request that the Ministry of Military Affairs and the governments of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces send teams to suppress the bandits as soon as possible, in order to restore peace to the region and maintain transport operations."

<h3 id="e55">Japanese Merchants Manipulate Daye Mineral Sand <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Hubei Provincial Government Asks the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Reject Strictly</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Iron sand is one of the official products of Hubei Province, produced in Daye, with excellent quality. It has always been managed and sold by the Hubei Provincial Government's official mining bureau, under the orders of the provincial government. Because the Hanyang Iron Works has been closed for a long time, and there are no iron-smelting facilities in the country, the right to purchase is controlled by Japanese merchants, who use various tricks to suppress prices. Last year, the provincial government was reorganized, and a Department of Agriculture and Mines was added. The official mining bureau was placed under its jurisdiction. At that time, it was the time for the bureau to sign a contract for the sale of iron sand. According to the usual practice, the official mining bureau negotiated a draft contract with the Japanese company Ishihara, and submitted the full text of the draft to the Department of Agriculture and Mines for review, so that it could be formally signed. According to the usual practice, the official mining bureau first negotiates a draft contract with the buyer, and then submits it to the provincial government for review. Only when the provincial government and the buyer formally sign the contract can it be effective. At that time, the Hubei Provincial Government was reorganized under the clear orders of the central government. The Department of Agriculture and Mines was abolished and merged into the Department of Construction. Therefore, the draft contract negotiated by the official mining bureau was not reviewed by the provincial government. However, the Japanese company Ishihara, which bought the iron sand, took the opportunity to continue buying iron sand as usual, even though it had not formally signed the contract. After the provincial government was reorganized and the Department of Construction received the files of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, some of our country's major merchants, in view of the manipulation by Japanese merchants, believed that it was undermining China's industry and commerce and encroaching on China's rights. They went to the provincial government to request relief. The provincial government, based on the report, instructed the Department of Construction to quickly investigate. After a secret investigation by the department, it was reported that the Japanese merchants were indeed selling the iron sand according to the draft contract negotiated by the official mining bureau. There were many malpractices, the most obvious of which was that the weighing was not done on the spot, but only by water gauge. The looseness or tightness of the stack could lead to fraud. This was a matter of weight. The second was the issue of quality. According to the usual practice, the sale of iron sand was based on the quality of the product, but the Japanese merchants made various harsh demands and raised the quality of the iron sand. As a result, they were able to obtain a large quantity of sand at a low price. This was a matter of quality. The third was the issue of price. According to the regulations, if the contract stated Chinese currency, it should be paid in Chinese currency. If it stipulated Japanese currency, it should be paid in Japanese currency. However, the Japanese merchants determined the currency to be paid based on the exchange rate. If Chinese currency was cheap, they paid in Chinese currency. If Japanese currency was cheap, they paid in Japanese currency. Combining the above situations, for the iron sand produced throughout the year, our country lost 30%, while the Japanese side gained an unexpected profit of 30%. After receiving the report, the Department of Construction forwarded it to the provincial government for instructions. The provincial government then ordered that relief be provided. The department believed that the purchase contract had not been formally signed by the provincial government and therefore could not be legally effective. Based on this, it ordered the official mining bureau to cancel the purchase rights of the Japanese company Ishihara, reported it to the provincial government for the record, and requested instructions on future sales methods. The provincial government instructed that bids be solicited. The Department of Construction then followed the order and drafted methods to solicit merchants to purchase. The Japanese merchants, limited by law, could not change the contract. They secretly sabotaged it, resulting in no results in the first round of bidding. The Department of Construction then held a second round of bidding. As a result, the Dingxing Company, which offered the highest bid, won the bid. According to the regulations, the Dingxing Company paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan and was contracted to purchase the iron sand. Because the Japanese merchants' plan failed, they requested the Japanese consul stationed in Hankou to protest to the provincial government. At the same time, they notified Japanese merchants in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places that they would not buy iron sand from the Dingxing Company, causing the Dingxing Company to be virtually eliminated. After receiving the protest from the Japanese consul, the provincial government rejected it item by item based on the facts. The Japanese consul then remained silent. The Japanese merchants then asked the Japanese envoy to protest to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government to inquire about the truth. Yesterday, the provincial government replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the details of the case and asked it to reject the protest based on reason. (July 18)</p>

<p>Order from the National Government Meeting to Temporarily Retain</p>
<p>Referring to the Example of the Chief Executive of Xinjiang</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The official system of the special district has recently been submitted to the central government for approval by the Northeast Political Committee, which has temporarily approved it to refer to the example of the chief executives of Xinjiang, Qinghai and other districts, and remain in place. The order arrived at the Northeast Political Committee a few days ago. The original text states: "Regarding the matter of notification, it is found that the former Northeast Political Committee's letter No. 2560 forwarded the official system regulations and forms of the Administrative Office of the Special District of Eastern Provinces, requesting verification and reply. The Ministry found that the Administrative Office should refer to the example of the chief executives of Xinjiang Province due to various diplomatic and geographical relations, and temporarily retain it. The Committee should supervise its progress to facilitate matters. The matter was submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government for review and approval. The Executive Yuan's instruction No. 2246 states: "To inform, it is found that the Ministry previously submitted that the Administrative Office of the Special District of Eastern Provinces intends to refer to the example of the chief executives of Xinjiang Province and temporarily retain it. The request was forwarded to the Yuan for review. The matter was forwarded to the Yuan for review and instructions were issued. Now, the National Government's Civil Affairs Office's letter No. 3819 states: "With respect, the 79th National Government State Council meeting discussed the Ministry of Interior's submission regarding the Administrative Office of the Special District of Eastern Provinces intending to refer to the example of the chief executives of Xinjiang Province and temporarily retain it. The request was forwarded to the Yuan for record. The case, including the official system rules and various forms, was forwarded for review and record. It was resolved to temporarily retain the old system. Accordingly, the case is recorded and the letter is forwarded for review and instructions. We await further notice." Aside from replying, the original submission is copied and forwarded for your review and instruction. (11th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Liaoning Agencies Implement Streamlining <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Affected by the Soaring Gold Prices</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the soaring gold prices and the high cost of all goods, all sectors of Liaoning's political and business communities have been affected, implementing layoffs and salary reductions, and implementing austerity policies in order to save money. The Northeast Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office has also recently issued orders to all military agencies to lay off employees and reduce expenses. For example, the grain and forage factory and the clothing factory have all started to implement them. The clothing factory has already formulated a reorganization procedure last week by the factory director Zhao Quanxing. All the original departments have been changed to sections. The colonels in charge of the departments have been changed to lieutenant colonels in charge of the sections. The factory originally had more than 130 employees. Recently, more than 60 employees have been laid off. Those who have not been laid off have also been demoted and had their salaries reduced. The original budget of the factory was 80,000 yuan. Since the implementation of the new rules, it has been reduced to 40,000 yuan. After the grain and forage factory was ordered to reorganize and reduce its scope, all expenses must be reduced to meet the budget. It has now been stipulated that the travel expenses of the factory's staff sent to various counties to collect forage grass, which were originally 3 yuan per day, have now been changed to 1 yuan per day to save expenses.</p>
<p>The Northeast Transportation Committee believes that the monthly public expenses of the railways under its jurisdiction are still paid according to the original amount, and there has been no reduction, which is inconsistent with the purpose of streamlining. It has recently ordered the Beining, Shenhai, Sitao, Jihai, and Taoang railway bureaus to economize on public expenses. From July, all railway public expenses must be reduced by at least 20% compared to June. As for the temporary allowances for railway workers, they will also be cancelled from July. (July 14)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Revamping the Capital's Relief Efforts <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Municipal Relief Center manages seven institutions, housing over 2,000 people. Inheriting from the former Jiangning Puyutang, it only provides care without education, and its facilities are outdated. Mayor Wei Daoming, aware of this, appointed Luo Mian as the director and instructed him to make every effort to save administrative expenses and make major reforms in the institutions. The following have already been implemented: (1) Women's Education and Care Center: The center and its branches house 800 to 900 people, living in cramped and unsanitary conditions, a veritable hell on earth. The director first selected dozens of vagrants from the vocational training center and hired workers to guide them in major renovations. All public items such as equipment, beds, and tables were neatly arranged. The practice of distributing firewood and rice was abolished, and public kitchens were established to provide meals, eliminating the idleness and dependence of the women in the center. Their abilities were assessed, and each was taught handicrafts and engaged in production and vocational work. The children they brought with them were placed in separate rooms, and children's classes were established, providing food, lodging, and recreational activities, resembling a school. The center's atmosphere has been completely renewed. (2) Infant Care Center: The old method of infant care was divided into internal and external care. External care involved entrusting the infants to rural women to breastfeed, paying them monthly wages, and sending them for occasional checkups. Internal care involved hiring wet nurses to care for several infants, resulting in insufficient nutrition and difficult care, leading to weakness, illness, and death. Director Luo has consulted and discussed with the Health Bureau to modify the nursing system. Infants will first be distinguished, and artificial feeding will be provided. Nursing supervisors and nurses will be added to the center, and many nursing students have been selected, which will be implemented starting in July. The causes of infant illness and death are also being investigated. Many are due to the fact that illegitimate children are first abandoned and abused at birth, coupled with poor feeding, making them prone to premature death. A maternity ward will be added to the center so that unwed mothers can come here to give birth to their babies, free from suffering, and to do everything possible. It will also be established in July. Other institutions, such as the vagrant vocational training center, the disabled care center, and the elderly care center, will be reorganized, distinguishing between active and passive natures, and providing different education, care, and treatment. The loan center's funds will be inventoried and reorganized, a civilian factory will be planned, and departmentalized production technology will be implemented. All of these are being planned and will soon be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Zhejiang's Disaster Relief Funds Transferred to Earthquake Relief <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stated that the province has suffered major disasters in recent years, with local losses totaling no less than 17 million yuan. The number of people who have died as a result is even more uncountable. He supervised the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Association in carrying out work relief and emergency relief, but it was difficult to raise relief funds, so a disaster relief bond was issued. With the approval of the Relief Association, the department issued advance subscription vouchers before the disaster relief bonds were issued to raise cash for emergency relief. The provincial government also convened a meeting to resolve to borrow 300,000 yuan from merchants to sell rice at a fair price. However, after the wind, water, insect, and drought disasters, bandit disasters followed. Various relief measures were a drop in the bucket and did not help. Therefore, while actively treating the symptoms, they also focused on fundamental solutions. The Department of Civil Affairs formulated county and city warehouse regulations and management rules and issued them to all county and city mayors to follow. Those that had already been established were reorganized, and those that had not yet been established were required to establish them by a deadline. They were also ordered to draft estimates of revenue and expenditure to be included in the new budget for the nineteenth year as a measure to prepare for disasters. However, recently, the county magistrates of the severely affected areas reported that there was a lack of large funds for disaster relief and fair-price rice sales, and requested that the special funds for warehouse disaster preparedness be allowed to change their purpose and be temporarily transferred for disaster relief. It is estimated that these special funds for disaster preparedness amounted to more than 400,000 yuan (excluding counties that have not transferred them). Yesterday, the Department of Civil Affairs approved it. (20th)</p>

<p>Dispute over the Seizure of Rice Shipped for Fair-Price Sales The county has decided to start selling rice at a fair price today (21st). 36,000 packages of indica rice have been ordered, and they are being shipped in batches. Except for a small number of the first batch that has already been transported to Songjiang, the rice shops in Shanghai yesterday hired boats to transport the second batch of indica rice. The fair-price shop run by the local rice industry in this city also ordered rice from Shanghai and delivered it to the boat for loading. Unexpectedly, when passing through the Shanghai South Taxation Office, they were suddenly detained because they had recently received an order from the provincial government that they must have a passport from the Department of Finance before they could be released, otherwise the tax payable should be paid by the taxation office. The boatmen reported to the rice industry guild by long-distance telephone and asked the county government to find a way. After sending a special telegram to the provincial government, they requested that the release be ordered to maintain the people's food. No reply telegram was received. However, the number of the first batch of rice transported to Songjiang was extremely limited, and it was sold out in a blink of an eye. The fair-price shop run by the rice industry was also scheduled to open for sale at three locations on the 21st, but the rice was still on the way, so the organizers were very anxious. It is learned that the county government has prepared a document appointing Zhong Taishi, a member of the fair-price rice sales committee, to go to Zhenjiang on the 20th to meet with the two departments of civil affairs and finance, fully explaining the importance of fair-price rice sales, requesting that the taxation office be notified by telegram to release the rice first, and requesting 40 passports for transporting the fair-price rice.</p>

<p>Disturbances by Wounded Soldiers, Local Martial Law There are more than 2,000 wounded soldiers in the 15th and 17th rear hospitals in Suzhou. Over 200 wounded soldiers were also dispatched from Nanjing. Disturbances to shops have often been heard. The merchants and people outside Changmen have become frightened birds. Fortunately, the military police, merchants, and defense groups are closely guarded, and no major accidents have occurred. Unexpectedly, the wounded soldiers caused trouble outside Changmen again the night before. It is learned that the cause of the disturbance on this day was that more than a dozen wounded soldiers were representing their friends in negotiating with a watermelon shop on Shantang Street in the afternoon and a conflict arose. The police detained seven wounded soldiers and took them to the joint inspection office of the military police regiment. The wounded soldiers, regardless of the circumstances, were angry with the police. At 7:00 pm, they gathered two or three hundred people to go to the inspection office to demand the return of the seven arrested, but to no avail. Subsequently, dozens of wounded soldiers rushed to the Second Branch of the Second Sub-bureau of Hengma Road, snatched a fast gun from the guard post, as well as a gun machine and a bayonet, and injured two policemen, Tang Shikui and Rong Qingyuan, with iron rods. The Sixth Sub-bureau also injured Wang Xin and Sun Chengkui. A guard, Cui Dekui, was also kidnapped on Guangji Bridge. At that time, all the shops on the road closed, and the city gates were tightly closed. The authorities immediately announced a special martial law, and traffic was completely cut off in the area of Changma Road until dawn. That night, more than a dozen wounded soldiers who intended to cause trouble were also detained and sent to the inspection office. The military police authorities have telegraphed the above situation to the General Headquarters for review. The injured policemen are being treated at Suzhou People's Hospital. The kidnapped guard is still being held in the 17th Rear Hospital and has not been released. Yesterday (20th) afternoon, the inspection office specially dispatched a large number of military police to deploy defenses in the Hujiu Road area, prohibiting the wounded soldiers of the 17th Rear Hospital from visiting the road.</p>

<p>Citizens of Xinghua Accuse the Chief of the Public Security Bureau: Wei Zecang, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of Xinghua County, has been accused by county residents Liu Zhenru and Ding Xia, among others, of using private individuals and abusing penalties illegally. They came to the provincial capital to file a complaint with the Department of Civil Affairs. However, after Liu returned to Xinghua, Chief Wei immediately sent people to arrest Liu. Wei personally conducted the preliminary hearing, asking whether the accusations were Liu's own idea or fabricated by others, and forced him to sign a statement withdrawing the charges. Liu firmly refused, saying that the facts of the chief's case were all there and he dared not wrongly accuse anyone. Wei became angry and detained him for eight hours before releasing him. After leaving the bureau, Liu went to the county to file a complaint about his arrest and sent his son, Liu Shuoqiang, to the provincial capital to report the accusations.</p>
<p>Collection of Hotel Tax Begins: The tax on hotels in Zhenjiang County was previously requested by the Education Bureau to be collected to fund education. It has been approved by the provincial government and permitted by the former University Council. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau temporarily collected it on behalf of the bureau, but after several months, due to opposition from the industry, the matter was submitted to the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Education for review. Now, instructions have been issued to actively proceed and not delay further. Therefore, the Education and Finance Bureaus, along with the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, issued a notice to hotel merchants yesterday (the 20th) stating that they will begin directly collecting the tax from hotels in accordance with the regulations starting today. Each hotel shall, from the date of tax collection, collect 5% from guests as a tax and remit the funds in full.</p>

<p>Joint Military-Police Inspection Office Established: The 133rd Brigade stationed in Yangzhou recognizes that there have been disturbances caused by petty criminals in Yangzhou recently. Brigade Commander Liu specially convened a meeting of the Public Security Bureau Police Force at the County Chamber of Commerce the day before yesterday to prepare for the organization of a joint military-police inspection office. It was stipulated that the Public Security Bureau Police Force would send ten police officers and the Brigade Headquarters would send a platoon of soldiers. The Chamber of Commerce would temporarily advance 500 yuan as start-up funds. It is now learned that the office was formally established today (the 19th). The location is attached to the Brigade Headquarters. Chief of Staff Xie of the Brigade has been publicly appointed as the Chief Director, and An Zheng, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, has been appointed as the Deputy Chief Director. They will begin operations immediately.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Strives to Maintain Universal Education Land Tax: The case of the Jiangdu Finance and Education Bureaus' proposal to levy an education land tax (a surcharge of two cents per tael of grain tax, equivalent to 4.88 silver dollars, with half the rate for reed fields) to compensate for the loss of the reed field universal education land tax correction was submitted to the county and then to the Finance and Education Departments. The Education Department instructed to consult with the Finance Department and submit a request to the provincial government. The Finance Department rejected the request (the reed field universal education land tax was originally under the reed field item. This land tax exceeds the original plan by eight cents. If two cents are added, the unexceeded grain fields will be exceeded). The county has now submitted a request from the Education Bureau to the Finance and Education Departments, begging to maintain the original surcharge proposal. Yesterday (the 18th), a special order was issued to the bureau, instructing it to follow the instructions of January 17 this year, jointly with the Finance Bureau, to formulate alternative compensation measures and submit them for review and transfer.</p>
<p>Water Police Team Seizes Smoked Opium: The Fifth District of the Provincial Water Police Team seized 1,337 taels of smoked opium. A special task force was sent from Guazhou to Yangzhou early on the 19th to hand it over to the county court for inspection. All the criminals transporting the opium have already fled.</p>

<p>Bandits from Jiande Invade Chun'an: Major bandit activity has been reported in the southern countryside of Jiande, causing significant disturbance in the area. The bandits have declared their intention to besiege Jiande County. Upon receiving the alarm, the Zhejiang Provincial Government instructed Regiment Commander Zhu of the 3rd Security Corps to lead his troops west to suppress the bandits. Upon hearing the news, the bandits immediately dispersed. However, a small group of them entered Chun'an via Shouchang. At dawn yesterday (the 13th), they occupied Chayuan Town, seizing all the firearms from the Chayuan Police Substation and the Chayuan Defense Corps. They also killed three policemen and one member of the Defense Corps, and wounded one policeman and five members of the Defense Corps. Shops such as Zhu Guangyu's were also looted, but the losses were not too significant. In the afternoon, they fled to Songcun and other places near Huxia. Their aim was to loot the firearms of the local defense corps. It is now reported that many of the bandits have hidden in Guocun, Yangxi Source, with their headquarters located in Qilang Temple, gathering two to three hundred people with fifty to sixty firearms. The leader is reportedly a communist surnamed Chen, who has been a primary school teacher in the area for many years. As for the 3rd Security Corps, they have all been dispatched to the Jin, Qu, and Yan prefectures. The 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Corps has come to Chun'an and arrived in the city yesterday, temporarily stationed at Zhishan Primary School, and will soon be stationed in Chayuan, Weiping, and other places. The militia previously recruited by the county government (four large brigades, approximately 400 men) have all been disbanded.</p>
<p>Residents of Jie Village Rob the Prison in Broad Daylight: The customs of the people of Chunxi are extremely difficult and stubborn, especially in Jie Village. In the past, three villagers from Jie Village, including Xu Mao, were arrested and sentenced to fifteen years in prison for a fighting incident. Ever since they were imprisoned, there have been rumors of violent mobs coming to rob the prison. Now that the stationed troops have been transferred and bandit activity has occurred in the eastern countryside, the violent mobs believed that they had an opportunity. Today (the 15th), they gathered over a hundred people, carrying homemade guns, and marched into the city. County Magistrate Feng had no way to stop them and had to let them do as they pleased. They immediately opened the prison and released the three prisoners (as well as five other prisoners from other cases) and left together with loud cheers. Although the civilians suffered a scare, they did not suffer any significant losses.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce Will Be Formally Established: The Zhejiang Provincial Businessmen's Organization Unification Committee believes that Hangzhou is the provincial capital and the Hangzhou City Businessmen's Unification Committee has been established for a long time. It should expedite registration in order to establish a formal Chamber of Commerce as soon as possible, serving as a model for counties and cities. It is now planned to combine with the Hangzhou City Businessmen's Unification Committee and set a deadline for registration. It must establish a formal Chamber of Commerce before August 15.</p>
<p>The Paying Agencies for Zhejiang Provincial Bonds: There are many types of Zhejiang provincial bonds. The paying banks are listed on the bond, but it is regrettable that they are not always clear. It has been confirmed that the principal and interest coupons of all matured bonds can be used to pay taxes to the county governments. In addition to receiving the principal and interest, the designated paying banks are: (1) Zhejiang Provincial Rehabilitation Bonds (Bank of China, Hangzhou, and its branch-managed treasuries); (2) Zhejiang Provincial Consolidation of Old Debt Bonds (Bank of China and Local Bank, Hangzhou, and their branch-managed treasuries); (3) Zhejiang Provincial Repayment of Old Debt Bonds (Bank of China and Local Bank, Hangzhou, and their branch-managed treasuries); (4) Zhejiang Provincial Construction Bonds (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Local Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Hangzhou, and their branch-managed treasuries); (5) Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bonds (Local Bank of Hangzhou and its branches).</p>
<p>Exemption from Parcel Tax on Native Cloth: The Finance Ministry has already approved the reduction and exemption of the consumption and carding taxes on domestically produced native cloth. However, the parcel tax was still collected according to the tax regulations. The Zhejiang Parcel Tax Bureau received an order from the Finance Ministry yesterday stating that native cloth is related to the prosperity of domestic goods. Therefore, the parcel tax on native cloth should be exempted to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and comply with the government's intention to promote domestic goods.</p>

<p>Thorough Re-examination of Starting Fair-Price Rice Sales: Xiaoshan City is organizing fair-price rice sales. It has been stipulated that the Public Security Bureau will order the village chiefs to investigate and report the names of the extremely poor and the less poor so that they can be issued permits. However, recently, genuine poor households have not received permits. They have reported this to the county government verbally. County Magistrate Du believes that the purpose of organizing fair-price rice sales was to relieve the poor. If the poor cannot obtain food, it goes against the original intention. He has specifically ordered the village chiefs to conduct a thorough re-examination. If there are households that should not be buying fair-price rice, the previously issued permits should be recalled. A new list of all genuine poor people should be created and submitted for re-issuance.</p>
<p>Approved Surcharge on Special Water Conservancy Tax: Du Shihua, the County Magistrate of Xiaoshan County, reported that the water conservancy associations in Nansha, Anchang, and Dangshan Townships were experiencing financial difficulties. He requested the Finance and Construction Departments to levy a special water conservancy tax of two cents per mu on the land taxed under the Feng, Lao, Li, and Han designations. It has now been approved by the resolution of the Provincial Government Committee and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Request to Borrow Autonomy Funds: The Xiaoshan County Government reported that the district offices had been established for over two months but had no funds. They proposed to temporarily borrow from the provincial tax revenue to alleviate the immediate crisis. Subsequently, the provincial government issued an order disapproving this request. Now, it is learned that County Magistrate Du believes that the county is poor and the people are impoverished, and disasters occur frequently. It is really difficult to raise autonomy funds temporarily. There is no other way than to temporarily borrow provincial funds. He has specially requested the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments to approve the temporary borrowing of provincial funds to maintain the current situation and avoid delaying progress. It is not known whether this request will be approved.</p>

<p>Disposal of Surplus Fair-Price Rice: The Ningbo City Yin County Civil Food Relief Committee held a temporary emergency meeting yesterday (the 18th) at 9:00 AM, chaired by Chen Baolin, due to the occurrence of rice merchants manipulating rice prices in the city. Regarding the case of how to dispose of the more than 17,000 stones of surplus fair-price rice, due to the drop in rice prices in the market, the villages are going to the rice shops to buy rice and returning their rice collection certificates one after another, the committee resolved that the city and county magistrates, together with representatives from the Party Department, would convene a meeting of rice merchants to persuade them to store the surplus rice from the committee at the original price.</p>
<p>Dispatch Troops to Rescue Chunhui Hostages: Chen Yuhui, the Battalion Commander of the 2nd Security Battalion stationed in this port, received a confidential report yesterday stating that Xu Zhangdong, the leader of the bandits who kidnapped the teachers and students of Chunhui Middle School in Yiting Baimahu, is now hiding with his gang and the hostages in the Siming Mountains of Fenghua. After receiving the report, Battalion Commander Chen immediately dispatched two platoons of soldiers to suppress and capture them. It is reported that they have already broken into the bandit's lair and rescued the hostages.</p>
<p>Raise Construction Bonds: Ningbo City Yin County has been allocated 1 million yuan for construction bonds. After repeated discussions between the city and county magistrates and the chairman and members of the General Chamber of Commerce, they immediately began fundraising. However, after a month, there are still very few subscribers, and the provincial authorities have sent several telegrams urging them. Xu Lunzhang, the Director of the County Finance Bureau, has discussed this matter with Chairman Lin of the General Chamber of Commerce and others, and plans to actively engage in fundraising in the shortest possible time. At the same time, a special appeal will be made to wealthy merchants in Shanghai to reach the fixed quota of 1 million yuan.</p>

<p>Telegram Orders Severe Punishment of Troublemaking Wounded Soldiers: Previously, the provincial government sent a telegram to the central government requesting investigation and handling of Chen Ganqing and other wounded soldiers from the Sixth Rear Hospital for committing violence, causing trouble, and extorting money. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the General Headquarters stating that, according to reports, wounded soldiers Chen Ganqing, Xu Jinyue, and Zheng Xianghe from the Sixth Rear Hospital were committing violence and extortion outside the hospital, engaging in all kinds of evil deeds. Inside the hospital, they incited riots and beat their superiors, which was extremely illegal. The Security Department should be immediately instructed to cooperate with the 15th Brigade to go to the hospital, arrest the perpetrators by name, and severely punish them. If there is any resistance from the crowd, they are authorized to act expediently. In addition to telegramming Brigade Commander Tang, you are ordered to comply accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Suspension of Sequential Supplementary Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity Funds) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Countries returning the Boxer Indemnity Funds support Chinese cultural enterprises. The allocation of Gengkuan funds should be entrusted to China freely, so that the intention of returning the stolen goods is not lost. For example, when the United States returned the Gengkuan funds, the board of directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture had fifteen members, with five American participants. However, the power of allocation still belonged to China, so at the sixth annual meeting held in Beijing this year, the funds for allocating and subsidizing cultural enterprises were still based on public opinion without any restrictions. Japan superficially returned the Gengkuan funds by only establishing 320 places for sequential supplementary studies. In fact, it lacked sincerity and merely used this number to buy off a portion of the people's hearts. Therefore, the Chinese members of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Enterprise Committee have withdrawn, and the government has proposed to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Enterprise Agreement. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct negotiations to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Enterprise Agreement, the Ministry of Education has issued a special order to the supervisor of students studying in Japan, stating that since the agreement has been abolished, how can the Gengkuan quota be sequentially supplemented? The order states that the Sino-Japanese Cultural Enterprise Agreement is currently being negotiated for abolition, and all Gengkuan vacancies should be temporarily suspended from the date of the order. The names and schools of all students currently receiving Gengkuan funds should be registered and reported for record. This order.</p>

Visitors were very satisfied. Over two thousand five hundred people visited throughout the day.</p>
<p>Opening Address by Chairman Cai Yuanpei: Briefly stated, today is the 11th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society, the 8th Annual Meeting of the National Federation of Vocational Education Organizations, and the celebration of the completion of the new site of the China Vocational Education Society. In the sixth year of the Republic, Mr. Huang Renzhi was greatly stimulated by observing vocational education in the Philippines in the United States, and felt that the people educated in our country were learning things that were not useful and could not suit their occupations. At that time, he made great efforts to promote vocational education, organized the Society, and at the same time opened vocational schools. At the beginning of its establishment, this vocational education was discussed with more caution than it is now, so it caused a great reaction. In the educational system, in Italy and France at first there were only four disciplines, such as Theology, Medicine, Law, and Philosophy. The two disciplines of Arts and Sciences also belonged to Philosophy. Five or six hundred years ago, universities only had Theology, Medicine, and Law, with Philosophy as a preparatory course. Later, the discipline of Education was independently established, all designed for professions. Therefore, the educational system was originally designed for professions, as well as the cultivation of character and personality. In Japan, it is believed that middle schools cultivate ordinary personalities, so specialized skill courses are set up in supplementary schools for people who already have occupations to give them the opportunity to supplement what is missing in the ordinary education system. The Society examines the needs of society and professions, opens vocational schools to the best of its ability, prepares opportunities for those who will serve or have already served in the industrial and commercial sectors to receive supplementary education, and operates vocational guidance centers. In rural areas, we have carried out rural improvement work in Xugongqiao in Kunshan, Huangxu in Zhenjiang, and other places, which has been very effective. This is something the Society can take comfort in. However, due to the lack of talent and economic difficulties, we cannot fully realize what we want to do, so we have united the national vocational education institutions and have an organization of federations. This is also the result of the Society's thirteen years of efforts. Speaking of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People, it emphasizes the Principle of People's Livelihood. When the problem of people's livelihood is not solved, and the ideal world is not reached, and people are not happy, we must relieve unemployment. If a person cannot get a living, they will do bad things, so it must be solved. Most people in our country want to find a profession, or they have already found a profession but do not have the skills to do it. On the other hand, there are things to do but no suitable people to divide them up. (1) Leisure singing practice, (2) Musical instrument practice, (3) Research on primary school music teaching materials (4) Primary school music teaching methods and practice, (11) Education, eleven credits, (1) Primary school administration (three credits) (2) Introduction to education, (three credits) (3) Educational psychology, (three credits) (4) General teaching methods, (credit) (12) Internship, fifteen credits,</p>

<p>Opening Address by Chairman Cai Yuanpei: Briefly stated, today is the 11th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society, the 8th Annual Meeting of the National Federation of Vocational Education Organizations, and the celebration of the completion of the new site of the China Vocational Education Society. In the sixth year of the Republic, Mr. Huang Renzhi was greatly stimulated by observing vocational education in the Philippines in the United States, and felt that the people educated in our country were learning things that were not useful and could not suit their occupations. At that time, he made great efforts to promote vocational education, organized the Society, and at the same time opened vocational schools. At the beginning of its establishment, this vocational education was discussed with more caution than it is now, so it caused a great reaction. In the educational system, in Italy and France at first there were only four disciplines, such as Theology, Medicine, Law, and Philosophy. The two disciplines of Arts and Sciences also belonged to Philosophy. Five or six hundred years ago, universities only had Theology, Medicine, and Law, with Philosophy as a preparatory course. Later, the discipline of Education was independently established, all designed for professions. Therefore, the educational system was originally designed for professions, as well as the cultivation of character and personality. In Japan, it is believed that middle schools cultivate ordinary personalities, so specialized skill courses are set up in supplementary schools for people who already have occupations to give them the opportunity to supplement what is missing in the ordinary education system. The Society examines the needs of society and professions, opens vocational schools to the best of its ability, prepares opportunities for those who will serve or have already served in the industrial and commercial sectors to receive supplementary education, and operates vocational guidance centers. In rural areas, we have carried out rural improvement work in Xugongqiao in Kunshan, Huangxu in Zhenjiang, and other places, which has been very effective. This is something the Society can take comfort in. However, due to the lack of talent and economic difficulties, we cannot fully realize what we want to do, so we have united the national vocational education institutions and have an organization of federations. This is also the result of the Society's thirteen years of efforts. Speaking of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People, it emphasizes the Principle of People's Livelihood. When the problem of people's livelihood is not solved, and the ideal world is not reached, and people are not happy, we must relieve unemployment. If a person cannot get a living, they will do bad things, so it must be solved. Most people in our country want to find a profession, or they have already found a profession but do not have the skills to do it. On the other hand, there are things to do but no suitable people to divide them up. (1) Leisure singing practice, (2) Musical instrument practice, (3) Research on primary school music teaching materials (4) Primary school music teaching methods and practice, (11) Education, eleven credits, (1) Primary school administration (three credits) (2) Introduction to education, (three credits) (3) Educational psychology, (three credits) (4) General teaching methods, (two credits) (12) Internship, fifteen credits,</p>

<p>Opening Address by Chairman Cai Yuanpei: Briefly stated, today is the 11th Annual Meeting of the China Vocational Education Society, the 8th Annual Meeting of the National Federation of Vocational Education Organizations, and the celebration of the completion of the new site of the China Vocational Education Society. In the sixth year of the Republic, Mr. Huang Renzhi was greatly stimulated by observing vocational education in the Philippines in the United States, and felt that the people educated in our country were learning things that were not useful and could not suit their occupations. At that time, he made great efforts to promote vocational education, organized the Society, and at the same time opened vocational schools.

The Society examines the needs of society and professions, opens vocational schools to the best of its ability, prepares opportunities for those who will serve or have already served in the industrial and commercial sectors to receive supplementary education, and operates vocational guidance centers. In rural areas, we have carried out rural improvement work in Xugongqiao in Kunshan, Huangxu in Zhenjiang, and other places, which has been very effective. This is something the Society can take comfort in. However, due to the lack of talent and economic difficulties, we cannot fully realize what we want to do, so we have united the national vocational education institutions and have an organization of federations. This is also the result of the Society's thirteen years of efforts. Speaking of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People, it emphasizes the Principle of People's Livelihood. When the problem of people's livelihood is not solved, and the ideal world is not reached, and people are not happy, we must relieve unemployment. If a person cannot get a living, they will do bad things, so it must be solved. Most people in our country want to find a profession, or they have already found a profession but do not have the skills to do it. On the other hand, there are things to do but no suitable people to do them. This requires vocational education to teach them the skills so that they can do things, have food to eat, and cultivate talents so that society has useful people. This responsibility is very heavy, so the Society must work hard to complete the task. Today, in the members' meeting, the director of the administrative department will report on the Society's affairs, and the chairman of the National Federation of Education Institutions will report on the Association's affairs. I hope everyone will give guidance.</p>
<p>Speech by Ma Xiangbo: Briefly stated, Liezi has a saying: "In Qi there are national scholars, in Song there are physiognomists. The national scholars are rich and the physiognomists are poor. The physiognomists went to Qi to ask the national scholars for the art of getting rich. The national scholars told them that getting rich lies in stealing. The physiognomists then returned to their country and committed theft. Soon they were exposed and imprisoned. Then they questioned the national scholars, who then told them that gold, jade, and wealth are private property and cannot be stolen. Only public property can be stolen." My view of science is that it is stealing, and it is exactly the same as the national scholars of Qi. What is stolen is the wind, rain, dew, and water of the world. He can use steam power and electricity. Speaking of whether everyone should have a profession, I think a person who cannot support themselves or support others is a thief. Everyone should have the strength to support themselves and to support others. The Chinese like to be closed off. In the imperial era, the Society was performing tricks in front of the emperor. Everything was just individual, there was no public. So China is an individual country. In fact, the country belongs to the people. Everything in the world, no matter how big or small, is created by the ten fingers of mankind. People are born to have professions. Americans believe that anyone who does not work should not eat, should not be allowed to eat. To truly treat the people as people, they must have a profession. Only by being able to do a profession can they live up to the grace of heaven and earth in giving birth to people. If everyone can have this spirit of vocation, the Republic can flourish. So to flourish, we need the spirit of vocation, we need progress, not like people suffering from jaundice. We must work for the benefit of the country, the race, and mankind. This is true vocation, true humanity.</p>
<p>Speech by Niu Xisheng: Briefly stated, vocational education is very important. In a country, if the people have no profession, it is equivalent to having no people. Therefore, we must use the spirit of mutual assistance to seek the common survival of each other's careers in order to succeed. Small businesses, one's own body and family, and large businesses, the country, and the world can all be started. If there is no profession, how can it be developed? Therefore, everyone must work practically to solve various problems. The Society, at a time when people did not pay attention to it, saw the importance of vocational education and started working, so it has achieved today's success. This is worthy of admiration. Now that everyone knows the importance of vocational education, we should make further efforts to not only solve the problem of profession but also solve the problem of education, so as to create a great career for the world and mankind. Please widely publicize the importance of vocational education to those present to achieve success. China's livelihood lies on this one line.</p>
<p>Report from the Administrative Department: Director Jiang Wenyu reported, as did Wang Cheng, the chairman of the National Federation of Vocational Education Institutions for the year, and the dean of the Agricultural College of the Central University. Details are omitted.</p>
<p>Speech by Gu Yinting from the Ministry of Education: Briefly stated, the National Government attaches importance to the Three Principles of the People education. The Three Principles of the People emphasize the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is related to vocational education in every way. This is something that needs to be discussed by experts. I hope the Vocational Education Society will study it for reference. The Ministry of Education plans to compile a curriculum for home economics in the near future. I hope to draft it to promote its early completion. The scope of education is very broad. The administrative organs cannot take care of everything. I hope you can provide materials. In addition, I have a few contributions: (1) The center of foreign vocational education is in vocational supplementary schools, training lower-level industrial talents, which is practical. We must also take this vocational supplementary education as the center and start from it, then there is hope. (2) China is an agricultural country, but ordinary schools do not pay attention to it, so the Society should pay attention to agricultural education. If it can be done well, there will be many avenues for students. (3) Women's management of household affairs is the case in all countries. The Society should pay special attention to discussion for the reference of administrative organs. (4) Vocational guidance, all countries have special institutions or commissioners to manage it, which shows its importance. The Society has already established such an institution, and should continue to work hard in the future.</p>
<p>Speech by Yang Xingfo: Briefly stated, since ancient times, there have been no people who eat without working. But why are there so many people who eat without working now? It can be thought of how many people work but cannot eat. If this problem is not solved, the Principle of People's Livelihood will not achieve its purpose. Therefore, what we advocate vocational education is to advocate eating education. In the current era of the recession of industrial institutions, not to mention others, even the educated people above the middle class should do some farming and work to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. A Chinese saying goes, "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and does not care about the frost on other people's roofs." I will now change it to "Everyone produces their own clothes and food, and does not care about the beauty and goodness of others." If everyone can support themselves, this is true beauty and goodness. Therefore, I want to focus on profession and not on occupation.</p>
<p>Speech by the representative of the Municipal Party Department, Mr. Mao: Briefly stated, China's past education had three defects: 1. Inequality of opportunity, 2. The textbooks for the aristocracy were classical or profound, so the common people could not receive education. Therefore, we must enable farmers and workers to have education, and we must promote vocational education. The Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People emphasizes the construction of industry and labor protection. With the achievements of vocational education, everyone will have something to support themselves. Therefore, vigorously promoting this kind of education now is suitable for the actual situation of Chinese society and helps the progress of the Principle of People's Livelihood to achieve the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Speech by Lin Kanghou: Briefly stated, although people have two hands that can do things, they must have a business for them to do. Foreign businesses are very developed, but in China, businesses are gradually decreasing, so they are increasing day by day, so even if they have hands, they cannot move. Therefore, we must think about how to develop the industry and first promote the three educations.</p>
<h3 id="e86">First Plenary Meeting in the Afternoon <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Amending the Society's Constitution: The first plenary meeting was held at the French Primary School at 2:00 PM. Those who attended were the same as in the morning. Wang Kecheng and Liu Zhanen were elected as chairmen. Yang Weiyu then reported: (1) Tomorrow at 6:00 PM, the China Science Society, China Enamel Factory, Shanghai Hujiang Tongji Guanghua Great Xia and other sixteen groups will host a welcome dinner at the New New Restaurant. Admission is by invitation. (2) Today at the Wood Society, there will be a dinner at 6:00 PM. Those interested in joining should join on time. At 8:00 PM, there will be a social gathering with the Drama Association performing "The Merchant of Venice". Then, Mr. Jiang Wenyu reported that the motions were divided into four categories for discussion: (1) General Vocational Education Group, (2) Agricultural and Rural Vocational Education Group (3) Industrial and Commercial Supplementary Education Group, (4) Vocational Guidance Group, then Yang Weiyu reported on the amendment of the Society's constitution, which was immediately opened for discussion (1) Article 3, Category 3 Jiang Wenyu proposed to change the word "Department" of Vocational Guidance Department to the word "Institute" Liu Zhanen seconded and passed (2) Article 5 Jiang Wenyu proposed to amend Liu Zhanen seconded and passed (3) Article 7 should be held once every two years in April, there is a need to amend the words "April", it is proposed to change it to July or August (20 people supported) Liu Zhanen advocated that it should be held in April and should not be deleted. Huang Li proposed to change it to the summer vacation, 29 supporters passed, (4) Huang Renzhi Jiang Wenyu explained the reasons for proposing to delete Article 12, passed, (5) Change Article 13 to Article 12, and so on, passed (6) Jiang Wenyu proposed that the words "Annual General Meeting" in Article 17 should be changed to "Members", Huang Li seconded and passed (7) Li Bohan proposed that the members' meeting should be held once every two years, it is proposed to change it to one year Chen Liangeng Huang Li advocated two years, slightly passed,</p>
<p>Members expressed their opinions (1) Wang Diancun said that vocational education has gone through the stages of advocacy, research, and implementation. In the past, schools trained talents, and everyone suffered from learning things that were not useful. It is best to break the school style and allow students to practice in factories or schools to set up factories to let them work. There is no distinction between workers, businessmen, farmers, and students, and they are integrated to avoid estrangement. In recent years, the production skills of students in schools are far inferior to those of factory apprentices. This is because the failure of training is a major reason, and the inappropriateness of the curriculum is also the conclusion. Because the national uniformity is too rigid and boring, those who choose subjects should also pay attention to the vocational courses in ordinary middle schools and should be given more flexibility. I hope that the Association will request for corrections.</p>
<p>It was decided to divide into groups for discussion: the first group Liu Zhanen Jiang Wenyu General Vocational Education Group, the second group Zhu Kecheng Yao Huiquan Huang Qisheng Rural Education and Agricultural Education Group, the third group Yang Weiyu Zhao Shifu Industrial and Commercial Supplementary Education Group, the fourth group Zheng Xigu Wang Diancun Pan Yangyao Vocational Guidance Group. Discussions will be held separately from 8:00 AM today and will be decided at the plenary meeting in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Free discussion: Mr. Zheng Tonghe said that there are three mistakes in vocational schools: (1) too much emphasis on form and not practical needs; (2) those who run vocational schools are inconsistent with the industrial sector and go their own way; (3) most of the students entering vocational schools now are those who failed to be admitted to other schools. To remedy this, first, the school format should be broken, and there is no limit to how many years to graduate, depending on their level. Second, they should contact or form a committee with the industrial sector to discuss it. Third, do not let young people enroll at will. Fourth, all occupations can be trained, even apprentices may be accepted and taught the knowledge of apprentices. Sun Zuji, Huai Boming, Li Lubin, Zhang Luquan, Yan Xiaofan, and others also discussed.</p>
<p>Dinner and Social Gathering: A dinner party was held at 6:00 PM and a social gathering was held at 8:00 PM. The drama association performed a play, and more than a thousand people watched.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Results: Chinese Team Wins in Singles, Meiji Team Wins in Doubles</p>
<p>丨University Team Loses丨Yesterday's Singles Each Win One Group丨Doubles Undecided丨</p>
<p>Meiji Team Performs Well… Returns Home Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Meiji Tennis Team competed against the Chinese and University teams at the Chinese tennis court yesterday from 3:30 to 7:00 PM. As a result, the Chinese doubles team, Jiang Daozhang and Zheng Zhaojia, lost 0-3. In singles, Qiu Feihai won 3-0. The University doubles teams each won a set, resulting in a tie. In singles, each team won one group, so the outcome was undecided. The Chinese team won 3-0 in the previous match, making the total score 4-1 in their favor. The University team lost 1 point in the previous match, making the total score 2-4 in their favor, plus one doubles draw. Since arriving in Shanghai, the Meiji team, apart from losing to the Chinese team, has won all other matches against the University, Japanese residents, and South Lawn teams. Their outstanding performance is truly admirable. They are scheduled to return home by boat tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Chinese Team Won One Singles and Lost One Doubles Yesterday <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Jiang and Zheng's Fierce Singles Match Suffers Setbacks</p>
<p>丨Lost Three Sets in a Row丨</p>
<p>The Chinese doubles lineup against Meiji was slightly different from the original plan. Lin Baohua of the Chinese team was injured in the arm and was replaced by Zheng Zhaojia. Of the Meiji team, Oofuji Kurakichi was also ill, and was replaced by Sagara. Jiang Daozhang and Oto Kurakichi still appeared on the court. Jiang and Zheng's skills are certainly superior, but doubles emphasizes teamwork. Unfortunately, Jiang and Zheng committed the error of not cooperating and suffered setbacks. In the first two sets, Jiang and Zheng were not without opportunities to turn the tide. However, they mishandled the situation three or four times, and great opportunities vanished like smoke. It was regrettable. In the last set, their momentum became weak. Although they had great strength, they were unable to use it. If Lin had played and had Jiang's assistance, victory would have been easy, because the opponent's strength was not particularly remarkable. Comparing the three sets, 4-6, 4-6, 3-6, Jiang and Zheng lost. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>
<p>Failure After Nearly Succeeding In the beginning of the ball game, Jiang Daozhang used his full strength to attack forward fiercely, with an intimidating posture. However, he was careless in defense and was attacked by the enemy. As a result, he lost two consecutive games. In the third and fourth innings, Jiang Zheng was comfortable in his movements, killing and dismantling, and at one time the enemy fell, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. The momentum has changed and should take advantage of this smooth sailing, straight to success into a 3-3 equal situation, the seventh game of the battle is very fierce, several times the same number, and finally defeated, and the eighth game was won by the enemy, the score was reversed to 3-5 behind, Jiang Lai fierce ball, won back a game, but soon again failed, and finally lost the first set with 4-6,</p>

<p>Ineffective Counterattack In the first game of the second set, Jiang Zheng failed. The second game was extremely tight. Zheng's sudden shot and Jiang's net interception were remarkable. Finally, they regained victory from a disadvantageous position. Afterwards, Jiang Zheng's steps became chaotic again, and they were frequently attacked, unable to extricate themselves and continued to lose ground, falling to 1-3. Suddenly, Jiang Zheng shot fiercely, and the enemy looked surprised. For a time, the situation was uncertain, and the scores were closely contested, rising from a deficit of 1-3 to 3-4, and then to 4-5. In the final scene, Jiang Zheng launched several counterattacks, but the opponent held firm, with no gaps to exploit, and they failed again. The score was 4-6.</p>

Jiang Zheng's transition was smooth, and the situation of both sides was comparable. Only after 3-3, Jiang Zheng's strength was weak and there was no spirit of revitalization.

<p>丨Decisive Victory Over Matsuo丨</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai's name is renowned within the country. At the 9th Far Eastern Games a month ago, the Japanese regarded him as a formidable opponent. Although he unfortunately suffered a defeat, it was not due to his inferior skills, but rather his lack of physical strength. Since returning to Shanghai, he has practiced diligently, and his skills have become even more extraordinary. Yesterday, he faced Matsuo, the main player of the Meiji team, and his performance was so good that it was breathtaking. Matsuo is ranked seventh in Japan, with extraordinary skills. However, he was unexpectedly defeated by a famous player in three consecutive sets, which was also beyond his expectations. The scores were 6-1, 6-0, 6-2. Qiu won decisively. The referee was Hu Xiansheng.</p>
<p>Style of a Famous Player The fierce battle began, with both sides using both soft and hard tactics.</p>
<p>Both offense and defense were considered, and a point was won with great effort. Qiu's best point was not rushing to succeed, but taking advantage of the opponent's weakness, attacking their unpreparedness, and making the enemy move towards a dead end. The first game was tied repeatedly, with no winner, but the final victory still went to Qiu. In the second game, Matsuo used all his strength to win, but Qiu's skills improved and he won easily. He won the first set 6-1.</p>

<p>Sweeping the Army In the second set, Matsuo was like being under Qiu's palm, being controlled by him. Several efforts were futile, and he repeatedly lost ground, beyond redemption. Seeing Qiu's eyes like lightning, he could see people's hearts and lungs, predict their trends, and swing his racket to strike, sweeping the army. The two stood far apart on the baseline, specializing in long shots. Qiu sometimes saw an opportunity to get close to the net, and he never missed, but Matsuo was too busy to parry, so how could he have the energy to attack others? In this set, Qiu won 6-0.</p>

<p>Triumph In the third set, Qiu won two consecutive sets, with a calm expression. Matsuo was like a frightened bird, seeing enemies everywhere. As the war clouds unfolded in the third set, Qiu killed the enemy and won in a triumphant atmosphere, completing three games in one breath as easily as turning his hand. Matsuo, like a trapped beast, fought back fiercely, and finally won two games, avoiding the shame of being completely annihilated. As a result, Qiu won the third set 6-2.</p>

<p>The University team was divided into two singles groups and one doubles group. As a result, each singles group won one match, and the doubles match was undecided. Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang are young and handsome, and are truly rising stars in China's tennis world, no less than the American teenagers Alison and Weinlein. Yesterday, they competed fiercely with Okamoto and Komatsu of Meiji. Nan Zhaojia was the most outstanding. The first set was played for a total of 22 games before a winner was determined. Meiji won 12-10. Zheng and Yu originally had a chance to win this set, but they lost due to being too hasty. It was a pity. In the second set, Zheng and Yu retaliated with a score of 8-6. By the time it was too late, they could not continue the fight, so it ended in a draw. The details of each group are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e93">Fighting… One Victory and One Loss <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The first group of singles was Yu Tianguang against Seo. The winner was decided in two sets. Yu won 6-1, 6-4 with a steady attitude and a powerful draw.</p>
<p>In the first set, Seo served first, and Yu Tianguang fought back bravely, winning a full game. Seo challenged cautiously and also won a game. Afterwards, Tianguang's ball momentum was very smooth, and although the opponent used a strong draw, Yu calmly fought back and made many achievements, rising like a blue cloud and winning five consecutive games, ending with a score of 6-1. In this game, Ke's attitude was quite stable, but there were still many mistakes, which was due to insufficient experience.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second set, they persisted and were unable to take down, each achieving 23 innings, Seo once took the lead with 3-2, and then Yu Tianguang made a false move and the ball was suddenly far and near, so that Seo could not run for his life, and Yu then took the lead again with 4-3, in these two innings, the battle was very fierce, Yu repeatedly fell behind, and finally he was able to recover the remaining game and turn defeat into victory, which was not easy, and Seo was also not weak, creating a tie of 4, Yu then continued to work hard, and finally won again with 6-4,</p>
<p>In the second group of singles, Shen Meizhen played against Sagara. As a result, Shen lost two sets in a row. The scores were 0-6, 3-6. In the first set, Shen Meizhen lost many points. Sagara responded appropriately and won six consecutive games effortlessly. In the second set, Sagara took advantage of the victory and continued to attack fiercely, winning three consecutive games. Seeing the situation was not good, Shen quickly launched a counterattack and regained one game. Before long, Sagara took the lead again with 4-1. Shen desperately tried to repay, catching up two games, but unfortunately his skills were weak and he could not save the day. Sagara then won again with 6-3.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Doubles… End in a Draw <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the singles competition ended, the University team Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Nan-guang, after a fierce battle, continued to compete with Okamoto and Komatsu of Meiji. The Meiji team took advantage of the fact that they had been waiting and had an advantage. However, a pair of young heroes were full of energy and would not show weakness. Both sides worked hard and the outcome was difficult to tell. As a result, each team won a set. Because it was getting late, the game ended in a draw.</p>
<p>In the first set, Zheng and Yu took the lead, winning a game. Komatsu and Okamoto defended well and won two consecutive games, making it 2-2. Zheng Zhaojia used his serving skills to take a 3-1 lead. Afterwards, Yu Tianguang was slightly flustered, the ball was less certain, and the opponent's offensive was very fierce, so they lost four consecutive games, making the score 3-3. With the situation tied, the competition between the two sides became more intense. Zheng Zhaojia had an excellent performance from time to time, and he and Yu Tianguang had a good connection, while the Meiji team was also very fierce and did not relax at all. Since then, they advanced side by side, and it was difficult to tell who would win or lose, each not giving way to the other. However, Zheng and Yu were often in an advantageous position, but failed to win in one go. Afterwards, they lost 10-11. When it was the Meiji team Okamoto's turn to serve, they were accurate and powerful, and they won all four points, so they won the first set with 12-10. It is clear from this competition that the competition was fierce. It took more than an hour, which is also rare.</p>
<p>In the second set, the twilight was vast and the crowd was still watching the ball with great interest. Komatsu and Okamoto were also playing against Zheng and Yu, and the two sides were playing happily and it was difficult to separate. The Meiji team won two consecutive games, and the momentum was strong, but Zheng and Yu were unwilling to give up, so they fought carefully and attacked hard. At this time, the battle became more fierce and the situation became tense. Zheng and Yu were determined to repay, and although the opponent's ball momentum was fierce, they were able to cope with it with ease. The two were also good at using the overall situation to make the Meiji team lose sight of one thing and attend to another, and they were exhausted. Zheng and Yu then played wonderful feats and reversed the defeat into a victory with a score of 3-2. After that, they were in a stalemate, and the score went from 3-3 to 6-6, and there was no difference between them. Afterwards, Zheng and Yu were like trapped beasts, and their spirits suddenly became great, winning two consecutive games and winning 8-6. At that time, the lights of ten thousand homes were on, and both sides of the battle were also exhausted, so they ended in a draw.</p>

<p>Man: Don't dislike that I'm old. You really should marry a fifty-year-old man. That way, he can protect you anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Woman: Rather than marry a fifty-year-old man, I'd rather marry two twenty-five-year-old men. Wouldn't they protect me even more thoroughly with one on each side?</p>
<p>Man: I really love you to the extreme. Everything I have is yours. I'm willing to offer the whole world at your feet.</p>
<p>Woman: You're clearly talking nonsense and trying to trick me. May I ask, is the whole world your private property?</p>
<p>Wife: Last night, we weren't having any fun at the dance party, so I came back to sleep first.</p>
<p>Husband: But as soon as you left, my fun began.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Postscript to the Opening of the National Joint Commercial Center <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>On the 16th of the month, the China National Joint Commercial Center held its opening ceremony. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, I will record some trivial things I saw and heard for the Free Talk section. I think it will also be welcomed by those who advocate for national goods.</p>
<p>Guests Receive Gifts On the day of the event, the venue was the large assembly hall on the upper floor of the old Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road. There were thirty-six rows of seats for guests, each row able to seat thirty people. The walls were covered with slogans such as "Promoting National Goods Can Recover Rights and Interests," "Strive for the National Goods Movement," and "Promoting National Goods is the Solution to China's Livelihood Problems." Hundreds of Party and National flags were hung in the air. After guests signed in, they were led to their seats by ushers and given a towel from the Samsung Cotton Mill, a pair of artificial teeth from the China Rubber Factory, and a package of Western-style pastries from Guanshengyuan.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen Visits the Municipal Hall for the First Time The place where foreigners handled political affairs in the Public Concession was rarely visited by our countrymen. The interior layout was entirely Europeanized. On the day of the event, a platform was built high in the hall, with a full-body portrait of Sun Yat-sen woven by the Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory, about four feet long, wearing a Zhongshan suit. Next to it were Party and National flags in a crossed shape. A gentleman sitting next to me said that this place was the meeting place of the governing bodies of the eighteen nations. There had never been a portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Today, to be able to hang an embroidered portrait on the stage can be said to be Sun Yat-sen's first visit. The listener burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Zhang Zilian is Exceptionally Modest The National Joint Commercial Center was initiated by Zhang Zilian, the manager of the Samsung Factory. On the one hand, he rented the house from the landlord Hardoon. On the other hand, he invited enthusiastic advocates for national goods to serve as members of the collection, design, and publicity committees, and they proceeded separately. On the day of the event, when Zhang reported on the preparations, he attributed the success to the support of various organizations and comrades, as well as the enthusiastic participation of various manufacturers. He also said that he hoped that all the gentlemen who attended would provide detailed guidance so that he could inherit their intentions and strive to carry them out. His words were quite modest.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong's Words are Experienced When Wang Yansong represented the Municipal Party Department to deliver a speech on the day of the event, in addition to detailing the flooding of foreign goods and saying that if national goods were not promoted, rights and interests would inevitably overflow and it would be too late to regret, he also said that Nanjing Road is the most prosperous place for commerce in Shanghai. Organizing a national joint commercial center here is related to the observation of foreigners and should be especially cautious. He hoped that all manufacturers participating would select fresh and timely, cheap and good-quality goods for display and sale.</p>
<p>Absolutely do not fill with stock, leading to the loss of enthusiasm of the main customers. Mr. Wang is an old manager of the Daxin Silk and Satin Bureau and understands the commercial situation. What he said was indeed an experienced talk. Everyone was pleased.</p>
<p>Minister Kong Bows His Head on Stage Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, personally attended the meeting and delivered a speech on the day of the event. When he went on stage, the glass window above the ladder was installed too low. He was a tall and burly man, and if he had entered upright, he would have bumped his head. Therefore, the receptionist asked him to bow his head up the ladder. He obeyed and went on stage, smiling cheerfully. In his speech, in addition to discussing whether the development of national products was related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, he also said that the national commercial factory organized this time has the three advantages that Mencius called "Heavenly Time, Geographical Advantage, and Human Harmony." He hoped that this would be extended to the whole country to save rights and interests.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Random Notes from a Trip to Hangzhou (Part 2) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Huang Jiping</p>
<p>Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, hosted a dinner party for me and others at the residence of Huang Shufen one night. He was humble and amiable, not losing the character of a newspaper reporter. He spoke eloquently about the plans to reorganize education in Zhejiang Province, which were quite important. He also asked Ge about the current situation of the Shanghai press, as he had not forgotten his former career. During the dinner, the Ninghang Highway was discussed. This road spans the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and is sponsored by the construction departments of the two provinces. It has been under construction for more than a year and is about to be completed. Chen said that he had traveled with Chairman Zhang Jingjiang by car from Ningbo to Hangzhou. The road was quite straight, but the bridges had not yet been completed. It will be officially open to traffic soon. I only think that the bandit atmosphere in the Liyang and Yixing areas is not suppressed, and passengers may have to stop.</p>
<p>From my observations in Hangzhou for several days, I deeply feel that after the failure of the silk industry, commerce has been greatly hit, and many people have lost their jobs. The society presents a rather panicked phenomenon. Hangzhou has always been known for producing silk in large quantities, and finance has been used to circulate it. The people's livelihood has been able to develop. In recent years, silk factories have gone bankrupt one after another, and weavers have suffered the pain of unemployment. Sixty or seventy percent of the rickshaw pullers in Hangzhou were weavers in the past. A rickshaw puller told me that when they were weavers, they could earn more than 20 yuan to 40 yuan a day. To look after a family, there was still a surplus. Now, running around all day only seeks to be full. His words were very sad. Consider the reasons for the failure of the silk industry: (1) The heavy collection of exorbitant taxes and levies. (2) Failure to improve fabrics. (3) Popularity of rayon. (4) Chinese people compete to pursue foreign goods. In view of this, the government, silk merchants, and the public are all responsible for a part of the responsibility. Are those who care about the industry also aware of the failure of the silk industry and know how to find ways to remedy it?</p>
<p>The night before leaving Hangzhou, a gentleman from the Asian Walking Group visited Ge and reported on the progress of the walk between Shanghai and Hangzhou. According to him, "From Shanghai to Hangzhou, walking along the railway, a minimum of fifty li and a maximum of one hundred twenty li per day. We arrived in Hangzhou in six days. Near Jiashan, we were stopped by the road police. We showed our passports and were allowed to pass. When approaching Jiaxing, it was getting late. We encountered several bandits dressed as farmers, who threatened us with weapons and searched us thoroughly. The eighty-five yuan we were carrying was all taken away. Later, we told them about the purpose of our walk and begged them to return half of it to cover our food and lodging expenses on the way. After much negotiation, they gave us a few odd coins and fled." Huang Jun is quite capable. He said that the male and female comrades in the group vowed not to marry. This trip is scheduled for six years. You can return to your hometown. His perseverance and heroic spirit are truly rare.</p>

<p>Since the price of gold has skyrocketed, it has greatly affected our country's business community, which is based on silver. Now, I will select and write down the main things I have seen and heard, as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Eastern Travel Impressions (13) Qian Hua <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In addition, Tokyo Performing Arts Communication specializes in recording films, dramas, and music. There are also International Film Communication, etc. Providing current affairs photos and copper plates are Nikkan Photo Communication, News United Press, Dentsu, and Jiji Photo Express News Agency, among several others. The most prestigious newspaper is the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, which is a branch of the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. Its daily circulation ranks first among Tokyo newspapers. Last New Year's Day, it broke the one million copy record. To date, the highest point reached 1.11 million copies. The next is the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, a branch of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. Its daily circulation is several hundred thousand copies. Next is the Jiji Shinpo, with a capital of 1.25 million yen, the Kokumin Shimbun with a capital of 3 million yen, the Chugai Commercial Shinpo with a capital of 2 million yen, and the Hochi Shimbun with a capital of 1.1 million yen. The president is Marquis Okuma, and it is the organ newspaper of the Minsei Party. Tokyo is the birthplace of the Japanese newspaper industry, with a longer history, generally around sixty years. The oldest is the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, founded in the third year of the Meiji era (60 years ago). It is individually operated with a capital of 500,000 yen. Because its foundation is solid, it has a considerable position. However, later, because Tokyo's productivity was far inferior to Osaka's, the Osaka Asahi and Mainichi newspapers rose sharply, surpassing their predecessors. Furthermore, they gradually expanded outwards with their economic power. Initially, Mr. Murayama Ryuhei, the president of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, began operating the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun in the 21st year of Meiji, forming a strategic alliance with the Osaka Asahi, exchanging information. In just a few years, the voices of the Eastern and Western Asahi newspapers greatly resonated. Later, the Osaka Mainichi rose sharply, but felt the pain of being a lone army without support. It actively sought newspapers in Tokyo to cooperate with. In February of the 44th year of Meiji, it implemented the acquisition of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, and then made vigorous reforms, giving it a new look. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun was founded in the 5th year of Meiji and had a reputation in society. Through the cultivation of the Osaka Mainichi, it has risen to the top position today. Therefore, when talking about today's newspapers in Tokyo, the first to be mentioned are the Tokyo Nichinichi and the Tokyo Asahi. But in reality, it is still the competition between the Osaka Mainichi and Asahi. The public opinion of the entire Japanese nation is controlled by these two newspapers, which is indeed enough to be proud of. As for newspaper studies, Tokyo is the center. The most famous is the Shinbun Kenkyujo (Newspaper Research Institute), which specializes in the training of newspaper reporters. Publications include "Newspaper" and "Newspaper Reporter" (daily), "Japan Newspaper Yearbook," etc. Furthermore, based on the International Conference of Newspaper Experts, it increased the education of newspaper reporters. On October 1st of last year, it established a newspaper research room at the Tokyo Imperial University, with professors from the Faculty of Literature, Faculty of Law, and Faculty of Economics responsible for guidance. Three students were selected from each of the three faculties to engage in research. The research materials focus on the history of newspapers and investigations of foreign newspapers, etc., for a period of one year. It is expected that the results will be considerable. In addition, various companies have dozens of publications on newspapers, such as "Collection of Advertising Theories," "Newspaper Chronology," "Newspaper and Society," and "Collection of Laws and Regulations on International Publishing Relations." The development of the Japanese newspaper industry has unlimited potential.</p>
<p>The price of gasoline used in automobiles (commonly known as "gasoline") has risen from 55 cents per gallon to 60 cents, then to 85 cents, and recently it sells for over $1.10. However, according to a Westerner named Lao Baiqi, the cost of this gasoline is very low, but due to transportation, it reaches such a high price. Previously, Standard Oil had investigated various provinces in China, with the Sichuan oil fields being the best. If refined scientifically, its quality would surpass that of all current brands. It was originally intended to set up a factory in Shu, but the proposal was abandoned due to opposition. When I (the Westerner referring to himself) traveled to Sichuan, I saw the local people digging for oil to use for lighting. Such a great treasure trove, yet no one in China has risen up to exploit it to meet the needs of the people. It is truly laughable. Alas, the Chinese economy is heading towards panic, mostly due to internal strife. However, the daily loss of huge amounts of resources is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Recently, various notices of price increases for domestic goods have frequently appeared in the newspapers. Judging from their tone, they are all due to the increase in the price of raw materials. However, since they are called domestic goods, their raw materials should also be produced in our country. If there are already such materials in the country, then efforts should be made to improve them. If not, then a survey should be conducted throughout the country to see if there are such raw materials. If there are, then start exploiting them. If not, then a way must be found to replace these raw materials with other things. Only in this way will we not be controlled by others, and the rise and fall of gold prices will not matter much. It is hoped that all those engaged in domestic goods will pay attention to this point as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Foreigners' enthusiasm for using domestic goods is something that Chinese people cannot match. Here is an example to illustrate this and serve as a warning to the Chinese people. The director of the Shanghai Post Office was originally a person from a certain country. During his tenure, everything he needed was produced in his own country. Later, he was replaced by another person from a certain country. After arriving at the bureau, he gradually changed to using goods from his own country. Even something as small as a pen nib had to be replaced. Chinese people, reading this, should be enlightened.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet, Leaving Wine, Plucking Flowers to Leave a Beautiful Impression, Garden Gathering, Tea Tasting to See Beautiful Appearance</p>
<p>That tea tasting place... did not have any noble ladies or virtuous women. Several old tea servers from Zhang Garden were still on duty there. Because there were fireworks and other after-dinner entertainment in the evening... they were set off on the lawn there. Therefore, there were many people sipping tea here. Originally, the tea sipping place was in An Kai's brother's place. Now, An Kai's brother's place has become a playground for various games. So the tea sipping place was moved to this lawn. Special five-colored electric lights were installed, reflecting in the dense trees and forests... making it even more brilliant and spectacular. When Long Ziyun and Zuo Shichen arrived here... they saw that the tea sipping place was already full of people... with hair ornaments shimmering, clothes fragrant, and the sound of pearls and jade chattering... Fortunately, there was still an empty space... and the tea server recognized Zuo Shichen. He said... Mr. Zuo, sit here... If you were any later, there wouldn't even be this seat. Zuo Shichen and the others had to sit down. It was originally a movable table... with a white tablecloth on it. Several rattan chairs were placed haphazardly. The tea servers went to brew two pots of tea. In the past, one pot of tea could be shared by two people... but today it was stipulated that each person had one pot... just to teach the tea drinkers to brew more pots, to produce more pots... to produce more tea money... After settling down... Long Ziyun asked the tea server... Isn't there fireworks today? The tea server said... Yes... that's why it's so lively here... Long Ziyun said... Are the fireworks going to be set off soon? The tea server said... It won't be until 11:30... If they were set off earlier... people would leave after watching the fireworks... So it's better to wait a little longer. Today there is a special kind of Eastern fireworks... that are very high. When they reach the sky... they release five-colored planets... ...... While the tea server was speaking enthusiastically... Zuo Shichen suddenly heard a laughing voice behind him. It seemed very familiar... At this time, Long Ziyun had already noticed it... and said to Zuo Shichen in a low voice... The one behind you. The one wearing a parrot green shirt... doesn't she look like Ruiyun? Zuo Shichen hurriedly turned his head... and it was indeed Ruiyun... He saw that there were six or seven women... sitting around a round table... as if they were holding some kind of round table conference... There were middle-aged women in their forties... and young girls of thirteen or fourteen... The other young ladies of sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen, and Ruiyun were evenly matched... There were four or five of them... and everyone was talking and laughing... When Zuo Shichen turned his head... Ruiyun had already seen Zuo Shichen... Looking at her, she seemed to be stunned for a moment... and hurriedly avoided Zuo Shichen's gaze. She was talking and laughing with a young lady next to her who had bangs on her forehead and a braid. When Zuo Shichen didn't look at her... she was secretly watching the shadow of Zuo Shichen's back... Zuo Shichen didn't see it... but Long Ziyun, who was sitting opposite Zuo Shichen, saw it very clearly... It was indeed:</p>
<p>Helplessly, the flowers fall... It seems like familiar swallows return...</p>
<p>If you want to know what happens next, listen to the next chapter...</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the interest rate market was as calm as usual. The morning interest rate was 7.28%, and the afternoon interest rate was 7.285%. Although the morning market fell slightly, the afternoon market rebounded, resulting in a small increase of only 0.25%. Silver interest rates were also very loose and stagnant.

Off-market banknotes were 120,000 in the morning market and 35,000 in the afternoon market. Money shops received over 4.8 million in foreign silver and over 43 million in silver. Because yesterday was the 20th of the month, the receipt of silver was slightly higher. The total value of interest rate ticket transactions in both markets was over 7 million.

<p>Silver Market Slightly Lower, Exchange Rates Stable</p>
<p>Cash Abundant, Large Players Dumping</p>
<p>Hovering Around 600 Taels</p>
<p>Domestic Cash Transportation Also Under Prohibition, Last Week's Gold Bidding Situation,</p>
<p>Seemed to show signs of withering, hovering around 600 taels, with daily fluctuations of six or seven taels, but the waves were not as turbulent as the previous week, and people were confused. Now that the swap has started, September has already entered the market, so August only had two days of market conditions at the beginning of the week. Since Tuesday (the 16th), trading has been mainly in September, and the swap price has been low due to the abundance of spot goods, especially after the customs seized a large number of smuggled gold bars in a Canadian ship, the way out was obstructed, so the price was frequently low. The long positions were given to the short positions, initially at six or seven qian, then about one qian, and then gradually increased to one or two taels. As for the market situation in September, it was initially stable, opening at 598.5 taels, and then soaring to 609.5 taels. However, due to the increasingly weak spot market and the strict prohibition, even domestic ports were not allowed to connect by ship, which caused panic in the market, and large players tended to sell off, so the price plummeted by twelve or thirteen taels, showing a weak trend, abruptly breaking through the 600-tael mark. As for spot goods, the initial bid for the forward was increased by 10 taels, but by the weekend it was only four or five taels, and few people inquired, which was very different from the previous week. In these four days (September), there was a review of 13.3 taels, and the changes in the market were difficult to grasp. Compared with the end of the previous week, it fell by about seven taels. However, the initial gold price was pressed by 50 taels, with the lowest being only 48 or 49 taels, and the weekend had to be pressed by more than 60 taels. As for the silver market, it was slightly lower, and the exchange rate seemed to be hovering around the same level. Here is a record of the general situation during these six days from July 14 (Monday) to July 19 (Saturday):</p>
<p>After September Entered the Market, It Turned From Sharp to Weak, On July 14 (Beginning of the Week), Both the British and American Silver Markets Were Low, But the Foreign Exchange Listing Was Reduced by Half a Grade, But Internally, It Turned From Tight to Weak. The Gold Price in August Had Rises and Falls of Eight or Nine Taels, And the Market Situation Was Chaotic. The Morning Disk Was 602.4 Taels, And Then There Were Three or Four Taels of Fluctuations. At Noon, It Was Seen That It Had Passed 604 Taels. Later, The News That The Customs Had Seized A Large Amount Of Cash Spread To The Market, And People Were Instantly Hollow. The Closing Price Was Only 595.9 Taels. The Next Day, It Rebounded Slightly, But It Always Rotated Within 600 Taels. Although The Big Article Has Returned To Long, The Foreign Exchange Does Not Change, And The Internal Disk Turns To Be Strong and Beautiful, Which Is The Opposite of The Previous Day. The Closing Price Was 597.8 Taels. On Wednesday (The 16th), Because It Was A Swap, There Were No More Transactions In August, But The Opening Price Was 598.2 Taels, And The Noon Closing Price Was 603 Taels. As For The September Entry, It Opened At 598.5 Taels, And Then It Was Vague and Uncertain. The Later Market Was Rushed To 606 Taels, Which Was Also A Lively Purchase. The Result Was 5.4 Taels, Which Was About Five or Six Taels Higher Than The Previous Day, Excluding The Swap. It Is Also That The Big Article Is Low Again, and The Internal Things Such As The First Order Seem To Be Firm. On The Next Day, The Silver Market Was Reduced Again, But The Exchange Rate Was Firm And Lacking. Therefore, The Gold Market Was Weakened By The Front Line, And There Were Also Six or Seven Taels Up And Down. Finally, It Was Around 603 Taels. Since The Cash Export Ban Is Very Strict, It Is Reported That Some Numbers, Etc., Were Declared To Be Shipped To The North, But They Were Also Rejected By The Customs, And The Declaration Was Not Given. There Was News Of Returns, Etc., So The Market Price Fell Into A Depressed Situation. On The Next Day, The Big Article Turned Long, And The Exchange Market Turned Good. As For The Gold Market, It Seemed To Be Trending Towards A Sideways Pattern, With A Difference Of 5 Taels, And It Was Implied Before And After 600 Taels. The Result Was Similar To The Previous Day, At 603.2 Taels. By The Weekend, The British And American Silver Markets Were Slightly Lower, The Exchange Rate Was Flat In The Morning And Clumsy At Noon, And The Gold Bidding Was First Strong And Then Weak, And The Downturn Became More Intense. There Was A Difference Of 9.6 Taels In Half A Day. Cash Was Especially Weak, And It Suddenly Broke The 600 Taels Mark. The Result Was Suddenly 596.2 Taels, Which Was 7 Taels Lower Than The Previous Day. It Had Fallen For Three Consecutive Days, For A Total Of 9 Taels. The Major Players Were Selling Vigorously For A While. Comparing The Opening Price On The Beginning Of The Swap Day On The 16th, It Still Fell By 2.3 Taels. The Difference Between The Highest And Lowest Prices In This Week Was 14.9 Taels For The Combined Calculation Of August And September. The High And Low Prices Of The British, American And Indian Silver Markets And Exchange Rate Bids Are Listed Below:</p>

<h3 id="e106">Securities Last Week's Bond Market Trend Turned Harmonious <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Rise and Fall Had Mixed Results, 46 Million Traded</p>
<p>In the past week, the bond market in the local securities market saw little spot trading, with only 62,800 yuan traded throughout the week. This included 23,400 yuan for demobilization and 12,000 yuan for troop reduction, with only a few thousand yuan for others. Because the exchange only traded one round in the afternoon, and the bond market was relatively calm, trading was sluggish. Except for Monday and Tuesday, when it reached about 10 million yuan, the remaining days were only between 6 and 7 million yuan. The total turnover for the week was 46.9 million yuan, a decrease of several million yuan compared to the previous week. The breakdown was as follows: 6.56 million yuan for the July demobilization period, 6.95 million yuan for the August period, 4.12 million yuan for the July customs period, 7.13 million yuan for the August period, 4.515 million yuan for the July troop reduction period, 5.325 million yuan for the August period, 2.04 million yuan for the July rehabilitation period, 4.455 million yuan for the August period. Other periods were very quiet, such as 2.115 million yuan for the July 6% reorganization period, 1.035 million yuan for August, 845,000 yuan for the July continued period, 835,000 yuan for the August period, 745,000 yuan for the July continued 25 period, and only 20,000 yuan for the August period. 140,000 yuan for the July 7-year period and 40,000 yuan for the August period. 360,000 yuan for the July 96 public bond period and 60,000 yuan for the August period. Only financial futures saw no market all week. As for the changes in bond prices, except for the slight fluctuations in financial 96, other changes were also due to the depressed situation, the quiet bond market environment, the balance between supply and demand, and the trend was also more stable than the previous week. On Monday, market prices rose and fell, with fluctuations of only about half a yuan. On Tuesday, buyers suddenly poured in and actively purchased, and the market price suddenly became popular. The customs increased by 2 to 3 yuan, that is, the demobilization, troop reduction, rehabilitation, continued period, reorganization of 6, etc. also increased by more than 1 yuan. On Wednesday, a large player sold out, and the situation changed. The demobilization of soldiers in July futures fell by more than 3 yuan, and the August futures also fell by several yuan. Customs, rehabilitation, continuation, etc. each fell by 1, 2, or 3 yuan. On Thursday and Friday, there were no major changes in the market, and bond prices rose and fell in a mixed manner, with the ups and downs being peaceful. The trend turned weak on the last day of the weekend. However, except for customs, demobilization, and troop reduction, which were all slightly lower by 1 yuan, there were no major rises and falls in the others. As a result, compared with the previous week, rehabilitation, reorganization of 6, continuation, and continuation of 25 all turned upwards, while demobilization and troop reduction fell by about 2 yuan. The statistics of the high and low rises and falls of bond prices in the past week are listed below: (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e107">Cotton Yarn The Yarn Market Was Quiet and Tranquil Last Week <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Both Long and Short Sides... Held A Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>The Situation Is So... There Is No Strong Immediate Need</p>
<p>The yarn market has been uneventful for a week, and trading in the market has been quite calm. Most of the empty boards were opened every day. This phenomenon is completely due to the wait-and-see attitude of both buyers and sellers. The range of rises and falls is constantly outside 5.5 to 6 taels. In fact, the world's cotton industry is still in decline, and many Indian factories have stopped work due to the lack of demand. American cotton is also lacking in rises and falls. The domestic situation is chaotic, and the underlying goods are still thick. All parties are economically exhausted, and the purchasing power is greatly weakened. Although the Guangdong gang has business, most of it is speculative in nature. Other gangs have no signs of struggle. The Guangdong gang is alone. The building is difficult to support, so people are still empty. Only a part is because foreign cotton prices have fallen to the lowest level, so they are long. The overseas cotton and yarn market showed a turnaround at the end of the week, which made people excited. They may have the power to rebound by one or two taels. The price of each month is slightly increased by 2, 3, 4, or 5 qian compared with the previous week. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 27,900 packages. Yunnan Gang bought the most current yarn, followed by Guangdong Gang. Other parallel markets were similar to the previous week. The statistics of the buying volume of each gang in the whole week were 7,080 packages. Osaka Sanpin yarn was 67 yuan higher than last week. The purchase amount of each gang is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Gang | Package Volume | Gang | Package Volume | Gang | Package Volume</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>

<p>The Invasive Power of Indian Cotton... Is Extremely Strong</p>
<p>The Consumption of Local Cotton... Has Decreased Greatly</p>
<p>The Environmental Pressure... Is Extremely Rich</p>
<p>The New Development of Han Standard... Is Nonexistent</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but the situation is bad, which makes people feel scattered and without any uplifting atmosphere. The market is extremely scattered, and the actual position has no development. There is no need for old cotton in each factory, and Indian cotton is trying to find a way out in the market, and the price is very willing to make concessions. Each factory has purchased it, and local cotton has been completely invaded by it, so the situation feels more sluggish. American cotton turned up at the end of the week, and the trend was better. Nissho's Domenco Trading Company emptied about 10,000 packages, and people were slightly excited. In recent months, it has fallen due to no one receiving the goods, falling by 56 qian compared with the previous week. The near months are flat. The total transaction volume for the whole week was 157,400 dan. The source was only 980 packages of Yao cotton. The recent current cotton of manufacturers was 7,980 dan, and the recent number of houses was 1,440 dan. American cotton rose by 20 pounds compared with the previous week. The purchase amount of manufacturers and dealers is recorded below: Manufacturer's Purchase Highest Price Lowest Price Number of Transactions Deadline</p>

<p>European sales are increasingly sluggish... Japanese silk factories are preparing to shut down.</p>
<p>Silk prices are high, market prices are low... Chinese silk merchants cannot sustain themselves.</p>
<p>Last week, the local foreign silk market had already become despondent. Since the changes in the overseas market and economic sector, the commercial market has been declining daily. The sounds of factories reducing work and stopping machines are rising, and the number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. Silk weaving factories in New York, Lyon, and England are taking advantage of the summer vacation period to temporarily suspend work. Even if they resume work after the vacation, they are all preparing to increase the use of rayon to reduce costs and maintain the current situation. The need for raw silk is decreasing, and there is still a thick stock of silk, sufficient for more than two months of raw materials. The raw silk market has no vitality in silk factory sales, silk prices continue to fall, and there is a market with no transactions. Futures silk trading has completely stopped. Silk exchanges in New York, Lyon, Yokohama and other places are also observing the summer vacation, and futures silk trading has stopped auctioning. The future of the silk market is becoming increasingly critical. Japanese silk factories are now preparing to shut down in order to reduce silk production and are requesting the country's government to provide low-interest funds for relief. However, Chinese silk merchants are selling at a loss due to high silk costs and low market prices, and there are few buyers, so they will be unable to sustain themselves. Last week, silk sales almost stagnated, and transactions were limited. Currently, 700 to 800 bales of silk are being exported. Overseas Chinese silk prices continue to decline. The Chinese silk market prices in overseas markets at the end of last week are listed below (New York prices are in US dollars per pound, Lyon prices are in French francs per kilogram):</p>

<p>Of Participants in the Expanded Conference</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee cabled the Central Executive Committee yesterday, saying, "In this time of national crisis, Nanjing Central Executive Committee, in view of the unfavorable situation on the front lines and the disintegration of internal organization since Yan and Feng declared their rebellion, suddenly conceived a fanciful idea, gathered all kinds of reactionary elements, and called for their so-called expanded conference of central cadres, confusing rumors and stealing names. Although they gathered substitute signatures, the meeting was not a meeting, and in the eyes of knowledgeable people, it was not worth a laugh, and there was no value or effect to speak of. However, it is heartbreaking that the opportunistic elements participating in such illegal meetings are betraying the Party with wild ambitions, following the stench like mosquitoes and flies, and changing their minds rashly. Although these people may have worked hard in the revolution in the past, their rebellious actions are now obvious, and their crimes cannot be forgiven. We should ask your committee to investigate and punish them separately, either by expelling them from the Party or by issuing arrest warrants, in order to maintain Party discipline and eliminate reactionaries. We eagerly await your orders." Sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee.</p>

<p>Chief Chen Formally Assumed Office Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Zekuan, Chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial River Police Team, was ordered to take over at the end of May and formally assumed his duties more than a month ago. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, he formally took the oath of office at the First District Office in Minhang. Invitations were sent out in advance to various sectors to visit. Yesterday, more than 200 guests arrived. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs specially sent Yan Shenyu, the Magistrate of Shanghai County, to represent and supervise the oath. The circumstances of yesterday's ceremony are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Order of Ceremony: (1) Playing music; (2) Paying the highest respect to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the Premier; (3) Taking the oath; (4) Admonitory speech by the supervisor; (5) Admonitory speech by General Commander Xiong; (6) Speeches by guests; (7) Speech by the District Chief in response; (8) Playing music; (9) Taking photos; (10) Tea and refreshments.</p>
<p>Ceremony Proceedings: Sentries were posted around the Minhang District Office, and a military band escorted the guests. A shallow-water warship and 20 gunboats were anchored on the banks of the Huangpu River, all flying flags. Party and national flags were also hung throughout the District Office. The ceremony hall was located to the left of the office. After the music was played, Chief Chen took the oath. The Chief's oath was: "I solemnly swear to abide by the Premier's will, obey the Party's doctrines, abide by the laws, and devote myself wholeheartedly to my duties. I will never waste a single penny, misuse a single person, engage in private gain or corruption, or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This I swear." Then, Mr. Yan Shenyu and others delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan's Admonitory Speech: Mr. Yan Shenyu delivered an admonitory speech, saying in essence: "Today is the ceremony for Chief Chen to formally take the oath of office. Shenyu is honored to be here representing the Department of Civil Affairs to participate in this grand ceremony. In general, every official must take an oath when taking office, but at the same time, the general public has a question, that is, whether they can fully implement their oath. Chief Chen's academic knowledge and experience are well known, and the importance of the Jiangsu River Police is also well known. Governance must have a good system and law. This is the matter of governing methods. However, with a good system and law, there must also be capable people to properly implement it. This is the matter of governing people. Therefore, Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs once said that without capable people, even with a good system and law, it would be useless. Moreover, the more laws there are, or the more precise they are, the more convenience it provides for those who engage in private gain and corruption. Now the Department of Civil Affairs has found capable people, such as Chief Chen, and entrusted him to fill this position. It is indeed a cause for celebration. Moreover, Shenyu also undertakes the governance of Shanghai, and especially feels that Shanghai County and the First District of the River Police have a close relationship. With Chief Chen in this position, he will definitely make a great contribution to defending the region. It is hot today, and I will not talk too much. I will express my hopes for Chief Chen. That is all."</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong's Admonitory Speech: Xiong Shihui, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, represented Jiang Yi in delivering an admonitory speech, saying in essence: "Commander Xiong is unable to come here today due to an engagement, and specially commissioned his brother to represent him in participating in this grand ceremony. He feels very pleased. Commander Xiong entrusted me to state that he has two hopes for Chief Chen. The first point is that the content of the River Police has been complex in the past and should be reorganized, and should be diligently trained in advance to have discipline and education. The second point is that bandits and reactionary elements are constantly stirring. On land, there are regular army police and security teams to suppress them at any time. However, the rivers and streams in the Jiangnan area of Jiangsu Province are complicated, so the River Police must work hard to suppress them at any time so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment."</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests: Lu Quan, the Magistrate of Jinshan County, stated that after Chief Chen took office, he immediately sent police to cooperate with the army to suppress the large gang of bandits in Jinshan, and they were able to disperse. Therefore, he represented the people of Jinshan in thanking him and expressed his hope that he would continue to work hard, etc. In addition, representatives from the Shanghai County Party Department and the Jinshan County Party Department, as well as Commander Xiong from the Logistics Department of the Garrison Headquarters, also gave many speeches.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's Response: Chief Chen delivered a speech in response, saying, "I am very sorry that the officials have graced us with their presence in this hot weather today. I was ordered to take this position, and it has been many days. I am only formally taking the oath of office today because at the beginning of my tenure, a large bandit disaster occurred in Jinshan. I first went on patrol myself and sent a fleet to suppress them, and at the same time requested assistance from the army. They have now been suppressed. However, I feel that the accumulated abuses of the River Police over the past few decades are too deep, and there is too little discipline. Therefore, I plan to start training them to become an elite force that will make it easier to suppress bandits. I have already submitted three requests to the Department of Civil Affairs: (1) to find ways to facilitate transportation; (2) to find ways to speed up communications; and (3) to find ways to expedite the transport of police teams. Once approved, they can be implemented. From now on, I will follow the provincial government's plan for bandit suppression and work hard to implement it."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's Brief Biography: Chief Chen, whose courtesy name is Bohua, is 38 years old and a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang. He graduated from the Japanese Naval Academy and has served as an instructor at the Naval Headquarters, supervisor of students studying in Japan, consul stationed in Zhennampo, Japan, and secretary of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.</p>

<p>After Chen, the Chief of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial River Police Team, took office in May of this year and inspected the various teams, he saw that the morale of his troops was declining and the personnel were old and weak. Therefore, he seriously reorganized and rigorously carried out military training. In the past two months, the old appearance has been changed. Recently, in order to examine the training results of the various teams, on the day before the formal oath-taking ceremony (i.e., the 19th of this month), he transferred water patrols from the various teams to Minhang for joint exercises to be inspected. On that day, there were approximately 300 people. At 5:00 AM, the inspection was conducted at the Minhang Public Gymnasium, under the command of Zhu Chen, the captain of the Third Team. First, there was a military parade, then a divisional parade, followed by team exercises. Finally, Chief Chen gave an earnest speech. The officers and soldiers of each team were full of spirit, and their exercises were neat and tidy, especially the Third and Fourth Teams.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Director Wu of the Construction Bureau Inspects the Zhuji Line <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Wu Wenhua, Director of the Construction Bureau of Shanghai County, was ordered by the Jiangsu Construction Department to inspect the Zhuhu County Road and to inspect the route from Zhujiajiao directly to Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province. It is said that a provincial road connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang is planned to be built in the future to facilitate traffic between the two provinces. After receiving the order, Mr. Wu first went to Qingpu on the 16th of this month to inspect the Zhuhu County Road, and then met with Zhang Qiwo, Director of the Construction Bureau of the county, to inspect the Zhujia Line. The inspection has been completed and the report has been submitted to the Construction Department. According to Director Wu, the trip started from Qingcheng to Zhujiajiao, along the Gangshan Lake, and went west through Laitougang, Sanjinggang, Qichadang, Zhijiacun Village Gang, Lanlugang, Qingtiangang, Shitang, Xinyaoyuan, Liheinei Gang, and Laoheiyuan, for about 77 li. The Yuan Dang blocked the way and could not cross the river. He had no choice but to turn southwest, passing through Jinze Town to the corner of Yokohama Village to reach the boundary of Jiashan County in Zhejiang. Asked by scholars, if you want to go to Jiaxing, you must cross Jiashan, otherwise you must cross Yuan Dang and pass through Wujiang County to reach Jiaxing. However, the Yuan Dang River is very wide, and there are many white ponds along the road. The terrain is low-lying and construction will be very difficult in the future. Therefore, it is only convenient to reach Yokohama Village in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province. Moreover, Yokohama is very close to the famous Xitang Town in Zhejiang Province, and transportation is even more convenient. Compared with reaching Zhejiang Province from Yuan Dang, it is more convenient. Although there are about 20 rivers in the middle, only the Sanjinggang and Lanlugang are larger rivers, and the others are small rivers. Even if you reach Zhejiang Province from Yuan Dang, you must pass through them.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Consultations on Maintaining Public Debt Methods <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The National Public Debt Maintenance Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Bankers Association, saying, "Dear Sirs, in recent years, the market price of public debt treasury bills has plummeted, and the national economy is almost bankrupt. The banking funds are also showing signs of shaking. Your association, as the leader of the banks in Shanghai, has the responsibility to rescue and maintain it. We cannot stand by and watch it sink. We hereby put forward four urgent rescue measures, and we hope that you will hold a meeting as soon as possible to discuss and implement them. (1) Telegram the National Government to telegraphed the Shanghai Stock Exchange that all those who sell futures must prepay the cash to the Stock Exchange as collateral. All margin deposits need not be paid again. Those who are unable to prepay the cash will be treated as speculative short selling and refused to sell. Whether the cash is prepaid or not should be checked by government personnel stationed at the Stock Exchange to prevent abuses. (2) Telegram the Ministry of Finance to immediately order the Chief Inspector of Customs and the 2.5 Treasury Bill Committee to announce the debt fund on a ten-day basis and widely publish it in newspapers. At the same time, the Chief Inspector of Customs should be ordered to pre-allocate the 2.5 Treasury Bill Committee on a ten-day basis for the principal and interest due each month and deposit it in each bank for safekeeping in order to dispel rumors of the government withdrawing funds. (3) Consult with the banks in Shanghai. For all debt securities that the government repays principal and interest on time and has not defaulted, whether they are tariff, demobilization, or troop reduction debt, they should be allowed to be discounted separately and used as collateral. They should not be rejected on the grounds of hindering national credit. However, if the capital of each bank is insufficient and it cannot be used as collateral, it should be announced in advertisements that due to insufficient capital, any collateral will not be accepted from a certain month to a certain month. Only then will the debt securities be exempted from mortgage. If other types of collateral are accepted, but debt securities are rejected alone, they should be sued in court for destroying the credit of debt securities in order to warn against imitation. (4) The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, which are acting as national treasuries, should abide by and implement the discounting of debt principal and interest coupons. All holders of principal and interest coupons should be allowed to discount them at a monthly interest rate of 4% for three months. After the three banks have implemented this for two weeks, all banks that issue banknotes must continue to implement it. After another two weeks, all banks that have not issued banknotes should also handle it uniformly and must not refuse. At the same time, a letter should be sent to the Ministry of Finance regarding the public debt fund, which should be allocated and stored in reasonable amounts to provide assistance. If the above four measures are implemented, the rumors that the government will withdraw funds and stop paying principal and interest will be dispelled. The interest rate on debt securities is extremely generous, with monthly interest rates all above 1% and around 2%. With the surplus cash in Shanghai, who would not want to rush to buy them at this time, and who would want to sell them at a discount and take losses? It is expected that within a month, customs tariffs, troop reduction, and demobilization debts can all rise to above 70%. This matter is of great importance to social finance and the banks themselves. Therefore, we are specially submitting measures in a letter for implementation. With best regards, the National Public Debt Maintenance Association."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Record of the Municipal Propaganda Conference <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Committee held its twelfth municipal propaganda conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chen Dezheng, Bao Rong, and Xu Xingchu from the Municipal Propaganda Department, as well as the Propaganda Committee members from various districts, including Zhu Shujian, Gu Shanzhang, and Shen Sheng, totaling more than ten people, attended. The meeting was presided over by Minister Chen Dezheng and recorded by Zhou Hanmei. After the meeting, the rituals were performed as usual. First, the chairman gave a report, saying in essence that the recent political situation is as dull as the weather, with little important news to report. The following are the more important ones to tell the comrades. Regarding the military aspects of the crusade against Yan and Feng, the Central Army has made considerable progress, and the strength of the rebellious enemies has been largely destroyed. Recently, the Feng Army has shown signs of preparing for a general retreat. On the Jinpu Line, the Central Army abandoned Jinan in order to lure the enemy deep and annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, the complete destruction of Shi You's Second Division was expected. Overall, the military situation is optimistic. Moreover, the Central Government's crusade against Yan and Feng this time is not about fighting for cities and expanding territories. The main purpose is to eliminate the strength by which counter-revolutionaries betray the Party and the country, so that the National Government can calmly build and realize the great Three Principles of the People of the Premier. Now the soldiers on the front lines are marching in the heat to eliminate enemies for the people. Comrades in the rear should enthusiastically comfort them. Other provinces and cities have been actively carrying out this effort, but Shanghai is lagging behind and should actively work hard to raise large sums of money to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers in the hail of bullets. The convening of the expanded conference in the North is really not worth a laugh from those who know the situation. It is just one more farcical play before Yan and Feng step into their graves. Then, Xu Xingchu, the chief secretary of the guidance section, reported in essence that the Cooperation Movement Propaganda Week has come to an end. This time, the results were better than last year and were very effective. However, the reactionary newspapers are still spreading rumors, saying that there were very few participants. Those who participated in this cooperation movement can see through the falsehood of these rumors. It can also be seen that the reactionary party's rumors are only making their efforts futile. Recently, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council has attempted to forcibly seize our Huxi police power, which is illegal. Our Party comrades should lead the people of Shanghai to rise up and oppose it. This incident makes us feel that recovering the national concessions is an urgent matter. The Municipal Propaganda Department will hold a large-scale propaganda campaign to recover the national concessions in the near future. At that time, we hope that comrades from various districts will work together and vow to use the power of the revolutionary masses as the backing for revolutionary diplomacy. We will not stop until we achieve our goals, etc. Then, the propaganda committee members from various districts successively reported on the work situation. Then, the discussion began. (1) A case on how to express opposition to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council's encroachment on the Huxi police power was resolved. (1) Submit a request to the Municipal Propaganda Department to forward it to the Central Government, strictly ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to stop the illegal actions of the Municipal Council as soon as possible and actively recover the national concessions. (2) Submit a request to the Municipal Propaganda Department to send a letter to the Municipal Government, arguing on the basis of reason and insisting to the end. (3) Secret. (4) Submit a request to the Municipal Propaganda Department to hold a propaganda campaign to recover the national concessions. (5) Submit a request to the Municipal Propaganda Department to issue a notice to the various districts to use the issue of recovering the concessions as the theme of the 19th annual speech contest. 2. A case on how to strictly refute the fallacy that Mr. Li, the editor of the Far Eastern Times, is advocating intervention in China was resolved. 1. Submit a request to the Municipal Propaganda Department to send a letter of warning to the editor of the newspaper, stating that he must not make such absurd remarks again in the future. 2. Submit a request to the Municipal Propaganda Department to write an article to refute it. 3. Secret. Temporary motion. 1. Submit a request to the Minister of the Municipal Propaganda Department to request the Municipal Executive Committee to forward it to the Municipal Government to issue municipal bonds and purchase land in the central area of the city to facilitate the construction of the Shanghai Plan. The resolution was that the original proposer should prepare a detailed plan and submit it to the next meeting for discussion. 2. Submit a request to the Minister of the Municipal Propaganda Department to request the Municipal Executive Committee to forward it to the Central Government, ordering the National Government to provide economic assistance to the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant so that it can continue to operate in order to develop the real industry. Resolution: Passed. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The National Coal Production and Sales Association Submits a Document to the Government <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yu Shunqing, a member of the preparatory committee of the National Coal Production and Sales Association, submitted a document to the government, saying, "Submitting a request to rescue domestic coal, promote its use, and negotiate the recovery of property rights. I think that the decline of our country's industry and the depression of the people's livelihood are all due to the economic aggression of international imperialists and the shackles of unequal treaties. Taking the Fushun Coal Mine as an example, it is extremely heartbreaking. The Fushun coal area is under the jurisdiction of Ning Province and was originally our country's land and territory, which was never ceded to others. During the reign of Emperor Guangxu in the 27th year of Guangxu, Chinese people such as Wang Chengyao and others requested to raise funds for mining and named it the Huaxingli Coal Mining Company. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan, taking advantage of its remaining prestige as a victorious country, falsely claimed that the mine was operated by Russians and forcibly occupied it. Although the Qing government negotiated with it repeatedly, it could not achieve anything. Later, due to the change of government in our country, the Japanese seized the opportunity to seize it for themselves, mining, transporting, and selling it without sparing any effort. The beginning and end of the process can be found in the case files. (Details are recorded separately.) All nationals should loudly call and collude to resist such great shame and humiliation in order to fulfill the duties of a national and save the right to benefit by one in ten thousand. However, there are unscrupulous and greedy merchants who recognize thieves as fathers, work as Japanese lackeys, and do everything possible to promote sales. They even go so far as to slander others with blood, exaggerating that no domestic coal can match the quality of Fushun coal. The Chinese people are not aware of this and are deceived by them. As a result, inferior goods flood the market and no one cares about domestic products. Not only that, the Customs only levies half tax on Fushun coal, while domestic coal is subject to heavy exploitation, such as the excessive miscellaneous taxes, increased train fares, and the military's occupation of carriages. Unequal treatment emerges one after another, causing the domestic coal market to be almost completely seized by foreigners, while domestic coal mines have goods piled up like mountains and cannot be sold. Factories are closed, merchants go bankrupt, and workers lose their jobs. All of these have a significant impact on the national economy. Over the years, the coal used in factories, ships, and trains in Shanghai, Wuhan, and across the country has mostly been Fushun coal. The facts are there and cannot be denied. According to the survey, approximately 7 million tons of Fushun miscellaneous coal are imported each year, and the rights overflow, worth 60 to 70 million yuan, which is a truly alarming number. We have always taken the promotion of domestic goods as our responsibility. Now that we have witnessed the endless seizure of foreigners and the indifference of merchants, we are worried and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we dare to submit a document and request that the Ministry of Finance be ordered to issue a notice to all customs offices to exempt or reduce the tax rate on domestic coal, cancel all harsh and detailed surcharges, and order the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Communications, and Railways to issue a notice to all factories and transportation agencies across the country to promote domestic coal and not to disobey in public and obey in private, lose power and humiliate the country, and become a laughing stock for foreigners. We also hope to find ways to allocate vehicles and reduce transportation costs to benefit merchants and people, and order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate the case and recover the coal mining property rights that have been seized. This will not only be enough to save our declining domestic coal and encourage the interest of Chinese people in running industries, but also implement the will of our Party, our country, and our Premier to abolish unequal treaties. With all sincerity, we respectfully request your speedy implementation. We will be truly grateful for your public service. Respectfully submitted to the National Government."</p>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Kecheng as recorder. The meeting proceeded with formalities. The chairman first reported on the grand occasion of each propaganda day and the financial settlement situation. Discussions then commenced, including: (1) How should the accounts of this meeting be closed and reported for reimbursement? It was resolved that the general affairs section should promptly prepare a detailed list, which, after review by the economic personnel of this meeting and found to be accurate, should be submitted separately to the municipal party headquarters and the municipal government for verification and reimbursement. (2) Proposal to nominate personnel to audit the accounts: It was resolved to nominate Xu Xingchu, Chen Kecheng, and Wu Xianren as the three auditors. (3) How should individuals and groups who participated in and assisted this Propaganda Week be thanked? It was resolved that the general affairs section should send separate letters of thanks. (4) How should the application from the First District Party Department for the allocation of overdrawn funds be handled? It was resolved to request the Municipal Executive Committee to instruct the first and second district executive committees to share the burden. The meeting adjourned after the discussions. Other proposals were not published due to their lack of importance. The Cooperative Movement Propaganda Week thus came to an end. It is reported that this propaganda movement was carried out using the most economical methods, with relatively little effort, and achieved great effectiveness, especially in practical construction. After the conclusion of this movement, various urban and rural districts in this city have begun to organize various cooperative societies. According to investigations, the Municipal Party Department has begun to work with the Municipal Government to organize the Municipal Consumer Cooperative. The Agricultural Sales Cooperative in the First District has now been established, and the Fifth and Eighth Districts are also preparing to organize credit cooperatives and consumer cooperatives. There are more than just these already underway. In order to promote the practical construction of the cooperative cause, the Municipal Propaganda Department plans to convene a meeting within days of responsible personnel from various cooperative societies in this city, as well as experts with experience in cooperation, to study the reasons for the failure of the cooperative cause in China in the past and the new path for the future.</p>
<h3 id="e119">French Concession Water and Electricity Employees to Join the Strike En Masse <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Twelve Trolleys Operated Yesterday</p>
<p>French Authorities Maintain Strict Vigilance</p>
<p>The labor unrest at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company is expanding. As previously reported, the union held another general meeting yesterday afternoon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Details: The general meeting, originally scheduled to be held at the Public Sports Ground, was moved to the union hall due to the delay until 3 PM. The Municipal Party Department sent Zhang Huinian and Zhu Yakui as representatives to provide guidance. The Public Security Bureau ordered the police to maintain order. More than 800 workers, chaired by Xu Amei, proceeded with formalities. It was reported that since the Traffic Department joined the strike, the union's work has been extremely tense. Although the management remains stubborn and unrepentant, the entire workforce, due to the assistance of the Traffic Department workers, has gained fresh strength and is displaying extraordinary courage. They are determined to persevere in order to achieve their goals. It was also reported that three representatives from the Traffic Department had requested the assembly this morning not to take any action regarding the company's operation of trams today, and they would inquire about the company's terms. The three representatives then went to inquire.</p>
<p>Expansion of Operations: The original strike committee and picket line of the union were all composed of workers from the Mechanical Department. Now that workers from the Traffic Department have joined, these need to be expanded to facilitate active work. It is reported that the Traffic Department has nominated Mu Xiaoshan, Sun Aitang, Zhao Jinling, Wang Tiansan, and Yang Daoqing as members of the strike committee, and Wang Binglin, Guo Wenbin, Wang Xueren, Xu Asi, Wang Baofa, Gong Jinkun, Li Guanyi, Zhang Liansheng, Peng Xueshao, and Li Zhenyan as members of the picket line.</p>
<p>Chinese Staff Assistance: According to Xu Amei, the senior Chinese staff initially showed no indication during this strike. However, now that the matter has been prolonged without resolution, they also intend to join in solidarity with the workers. If the Chinese staff can unite and join, the company, which is currently in its billing period, has hundreds of thousands in outstanding accounts, which will definitely be affected, and the workers' victory can be predicted.</p>
<p>Reduced Number of Vehicles: Of the 56 vehicles in the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, only 12 were operated yesterday. These included eight Route 2 trams from Xujiahui to the 16th Pier, and four Route 10 trams from Lujiabang to the 16th Pier. If further damage occurs, it is feared that the number of vehicles will be further reduced today.</p>
<p>Expanded Support: During this strike, the Municipal Party Department has exerted its full effort to provide assistance. The support association organized by more than 60 groups is concerned that the strength of the support is still insufficient, so it has decided to expand it as much as possible to expedite the resolution.</p>
<p>Union Funds: Regarding the funding issue for the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union, its monthly income used to be approximately 80 taels of silver, and the company also provided a monthly subsidy of 500 taels of silver. Since the strike, the company originally intended to suspend the subsidy, but through the efforts of, it was still paid as usual, and the July subsidy has also been received, so there should be absolutely no funding problems.</p>
<p>Arrested Workers: There have been repeated reports of workers being arrested. After discussion, the assembly yesterday resolved that if the above situation occurs again, the union will provide substantial assistance to the families of the arrested workers, providing them with funds to prevent panic and reassure the families of the arrested workers.</p>
<p>Company's New Workers: The company has not recruited many White Russians, but contracts were signed at the time of employment, so even if the workers return to work, these Russians may not pose a problem. As for the newly recruited Chinese workers, there are currently more than 200, but they are not familiar with the work, so the vehicles cannot be fully repaired. For this reason, the company is eager for the old workers to return to work, but they generally refuse to join out of righteous indignation.</p>
<p>Police Preparedness: The French Concession authorities have increased their vigilance yesterday. Each tram must have one Chinese and one Annamese constable. Each trailer has one Chinese constable. At each key intersection along the tram routes, there are French and Annamese constables patrolling in armed cars. The area around the headquarters at Lujiabang is even more heavily guarded. At the intersection of the Chinese concession and Luban Road, a dense network is set up, with only one person allowed to pass. Armed volunteer detectives are also stationed at various key points to prevent accidents. The iron gates at other locations such as the Old North Gate are all closed, and only one gate is left open at Dongxin Bridge to allow traffic to pass.</p>

<p>The Garrison Headquarters Has Instructed Military and Police to Protect the Shanghai Baike Road Overseas Chinese Federation. The Tongliyuan Leather Factory and Chengfa Leather Factory, opened by overseas Chinese in Zhabei, previously stated that they were being harassed by local ruffians. They requested that the relevant authorities be notified to strictly investigate and crack down on these activities in order to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. The original text is recorded below: Shanghai Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Municipal Government, Local Court, Public Security Bureau, [Honorable officials], According to the letter from the Tongliyuan Leather Factory and Chengfa Leather Factory, which are invested in by overseas Chinese, (The submission has been seen in this newspaper on the 12th) etc. In response to this, Zhabei is located in the central area of northern Shanghai, with numerous military and police. However, lawless ruffians have gathered in numbers of up to several hundred, forcibly seizing factories in broad daylight, assaulting the owners, more than once. This is no different from robbery. The local military and police failed to provide protection in advance, which is surprising. The government's orders to attract overseas Chinese to return to the country to start businesses and to protect them have been reiterated repeatedly. If lawless ruffians in the area are allowed to destroy them, obstructing the future of overseas Chinese businesses, it will not only harm local public security but also violate government orders. It is urged that the military and police authorities instruct their subordinates to strictly arrest the criminals involved in the case and punish them according to the law. Please have the Public Security Bureau set up police posts near the factory and regularly send patrols to patrol. Since the facts of this case seem to constitute a violation of the law on punishing bandits, rather than ordinary criminal law, the local court should conduct a clear investigation, separately administer jurisdiction, and transfer the case for interrogation. This is of utmost importance. [Respectfully], Overseas Chinese Federation [Knocks head], Seal, etc. It is reported that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, upon receiving the letter from the Overseas Chinese Federation yesterday, immediately instructed all relevant military and police organs to jointly investigate and protect, and ordered them to respond to the Overseas Chinese Federation and inform Tongliyuan Leather Factory, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Proclaims Opium Cessation Measures <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a proclamation yesterday, stating, "In accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Government No. 4787, it has been approved by the Opium Prohibition Committee to investigate the opening of hospitals that also handle opium cessation matters, and the establishment of municipal and county opium cessation centers. Opium addicts have been found and sent to hospitals to be forced to quit. It is feared that the general opium addicts do not fully understand the opium cessation measures and are afraid to move forward, which is a great loss of the central government's intention to set up opium cessation hospitals to encourage opium addicts to confess and quit opium. In accordance with Article 16 of the Opium Prohibition Implementation Regulations, all opium addicts who confess and are willing to be admitted to the hospital for opium cessation, or quit opium, before being discovered, are exempt from punishment. After deliberation at the 39th committee meeting, it was resolved to consult with each provincial government and each special municipal government to make announcements so that opium addicts will have the opportunity to confess and be admitted to the hospital to quit opium, etc. In addition to separate consultations, the relevant cases are consulted for reference and handling, and it is hoped that the subordinates will comply with the regulations, etc. In accordance with this, in addition to the external order, the bureau is ordered to comply with the regulations and jointly make announcements so that the opium addicts will be aware of this. All those who have this addiction are limited to applying to the opium cessation hospital on their own, so that they can fundamentally quit opium. If there are any who deliberately disobey, once discovered, they will be detained and severely punished, without leniency. Each should take heed and not violate. This announcement, (The following hospitals designated to handle opium cessation are listed) Shanghai Municipal Hospital, at Santai Wharf in the South City, China Red Cross General Hospital, Hague Road in the Concession, Southeast Hospital, in Hugunying, South City, Pingmin Hospital, Xinjiang Road in Zhabei, Jiangsu Opium Cessation Hospital, Zhizaoju Road in the South City, (Opium Cessation Fee Measures) Those who stay in first and second class wards, in addition to the hospital fees, the first class is 3.5 yuan per day, the second class is 2.4 yuan, the third class is 1.3 yuan, and a total of 10 yuan is collected for opium cessation fees. The fourth class ward only charges a hospital fee of 5 jiao per day, and the opium cessation fee is waived. For inpatient opium cessation, the first class costs 50 yuan in total, the second class costs 30 yuan in total, and the third class costs 15 yuan. The poor can request a reduction. Those who stay in the first class ward are charged 3 yuan for inpatient fees per day, and another 10 yuan for opium cessation fees. Those who stay in the second class ward are charged 2 yuan for inpatient fees per day, and another 8 yuan for opium cessation fees. Those who stay in the third class ward are charged 1 yuan for inpatient fees per day, and another 5 yuan for opium cessation fees. Inpatient meals cost 3 jiao per day. For those who have an addiction of one qian until opium cessation, a total of 10 yuan is charged for opium cessation fees. However, those who are truly unable to pay may request a reduction or exemption. Inpatient opium cessation costs 2 yuan per day for first class, 1.5 yuan for second class, 1 yuan for third class, and 7 jiao for fourth class. The truly poor may request a reduction or exemption. For outpatient opium cessation, the fee is 3 yuan per visit."</p>
<h3 id="e131">China First Credit Insurance Company Established <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Credit insurance is extremely beneficial to society. Credit insurance companies in the United Kingdom were established earliest, approximately 200 years ago. The United States followed, and had credit insurance company organizations 70 years ago. Japan also imitated the United Kingdom and the United States to establish credit insurance companies 20 years ago, which is extremely convenient for society. Various personnel matters in society require credit as a guarantee, so those seeking employment must first find a guarantor. The difficulty of finding a guarantor is greater than seeking employment. Often, those who are new to society lack credit, and even if they have talents, it is difficult to find a suitable guarantor, so they cannot take up employment. Those who provide guarantees are also wary of the heavy responsibility and dare not act rashly. In the event of an accident, the guarantor may even go bankrupt. The employer is also greatly affected. Currently, several prominent figures in the Shanghai business community, recognizing that China does not yet have such a company, have jointly invested in establishing the China First Credit Insurance Company on Sichuan Road to alleviate this difficulty. After submitting a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval and registration, a license was issued. The organization has been established. The company can provide guarantees for those who have obtained employment but cannot obtain a guarantor. The fees are extremely low, but the responsibility is extremely heavy. For those who are guaranteed by the company, the company is responsible for compensating the employer for all acts of fraud, theft, embezzlement, and malfeasance that cause the employer to suffer losses. This is an unprecedented innovation in China, which is of great benefit to society and individuals.</p>

<h3 id="e138">The Situation Regarding Police Authority in Western Shanghai Remains Serious <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the incident of the Public Concession Public Security Bureau infringing upon police authority in Western Shanghai, leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai have successively made serious statements. As for the actual situation in Western Shanghai in recent days, a general report can be obtained as follows: Since the armed demonstration by the police on the 15th created an unfavorable situation of confrontation between police and constables, stimulating the hearts of all Shanghai residents, the police have remained ambitious. Day by day, police officers on horseback and foot from the Jing'an Temple Public Security Bureau are dispatched in groups of two or three, three or five, either by bicycle or on foot, constantly strolling and patrolling along streets such as Great Western Road (now Yan'an West Road) and Connaught Road (now Kangding Road). This is especially true at night. Each group is led by a Western constable. In addition, the Sixth District Police Station inside the Gangjia Bridge and Jin Situ Temple on Great Western Road only has two posts. Whenever there is a shortage of officers on duty, they must cross the road. In recent days, long-term police officers crossing the road or standing in the middle of the road at night are immediately interfered with and detained by Western constables whenever they encounter them. While the police officers ignore them, they chatter endlessly. Yesterday, Yang, the patrol captain of the police station, reported the information to Director Ren of the Sixth District for review and determination.</p>

The statement stated that the plaintiff contracted to build construction projects for the Nanjing Municipal Government, and on April 15, the Nanjing Municipal Finance Bureau allocated various outstanding payments. The plaintiff's construction costs were also included in the allocation, amounting to 4,000 yuan. The funds were transferred by the Nanjing Municipal Engineering Bureau. When the plaintiff went to collect the construction fees, the first defendant suddenly ordered the director of the Municipal Engineering Bureau to withhold 2,000 yuan, so the Engineering Bureau only agreed to allocate 2,000 yuan. However, although the bureau paid 2,000 yuan, it still wanted the plaintiff to write a receipt for 4,000 yuan. At that time, the plaintiff thought that the first defendant would be discharged from the position of Nanjing mayor on April 19, and if the payment was not collected before the first defendant was discharged, it would inevitably involve more trouble in the future, so he painfully wrote a receipt for 4,000 yuan. After the plaintiff received 2,000 yuan, he was unclear about the reasons for withholding the money, so he went to the residence of the first defendant with the director of the Engineering Bureau to inquire about the reasons for withholding the money. At that time, he only said that it was withheld on behalf of the second defendant. Later, the plaintiff requested the first defendant to temporarily retain the withheld funds and asked the first defendant to personally write a receipt for the withheld funds of 2,000 yuan as proof. Unexpectedly, after the plaintiff returned to Shanghai, he repeatedly visited the second defendant but was refused to meet. The first defendant repeatedly corresponded but still instructed to negotiate with the second defendant, which was obviously a deliberate evasion. In desperation, this lawsuit was filed to pursue the matter. The plaintiff also submitted a photograph of a note for 2,000 yuan. The first defendant's address was filled in as the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, and the second defendant's address was filled in as the office of the Great China Company. This court reviewed and made a judgment. (Reasons) Article 14 of the Civil Procedure Law states that the lawsuit shall be under the jurisdiction of the court where the defendant's ordinary trial registration is located. Article 15, paragraph 1, states that ordinary trial registration is determined by the address. Article 16, paragraph 1, states that the ordinary trial registration of the national treasury shall be determined according to the location of the agency representing the national treasury for litigation. The ordinary trial registration of all public corporations other than the national treasury shall be determined according to the location of its public affairs office. The money sued for by the plaintiff in this case is the construction price of the Nanjing Special Municipality construction project, and the location of the office and the public affairs office cannot be recognized as the defendant's ordinary trial registration. According to the above provisions, this case is not under the jurisdiction of this court. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit with this court, which is a jurisdictional error. According to Article 290, paragraph 1, item 1 of the Civil Procedure Law, it is rejected. The litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff. The judgment is specially made as the main text.</p>

<p>Already Verified by the Forensic Doctor</p>
<p>Although Chen Lianying Was Defiled</p>
<p>But the Hymen Is Intact</p>
<p>Recently, cases of rape of young girls have occurred repeatedly, which is truly a worry for social customs and people's hearts. The Special District Local Court tried another similar case the day before yesterday. The matter has been published in this newspaper. The defendant is Zhou Zicai, a 17-year-old apprentice at the Kuifa Barber Shop at No. 440 North Henan Road. The young girl who was raped is Xiu Lian, the daughter of Mrs. Chen, a Guangdong woman living at No. 439 next door to the shop. She is eight years old. According to Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the Public Security Bureau, after this case occurred, the Hongkou Public Security Bureau sent detectives to the hospital for an examination. After the doctor issued an examination report, it stated that the girl had indeed been raped, but the hymen was still intact. The examination report was then submitted to the case. Subsequently, Mrs. Chen came to the case and confessed that on the afternoon of the 18th of this month, I went out to shop, and when I returned home after a while, my daughter Xiu Lian suddenly said to me that she had been beaten in the thighs by Zhou Zicai next door, and it was very painful now. I looked at her and saw that her skin was red. Later, I saw the girl walking unsteadily, and I was very suspicious. In the evening, when bathing her, I saw blood flowing from her private parts, so I strictly questioned her. The girl no longer denied it and began to say that after I went out, she was lured to the loft by Zhou, who took off her clothes and pants and committed indecent acts on her. The girl cried out in pain, and the defendant still did not stop his bestial behavior. I heard the girl's words, so I reported it to the Public Security Bureau, etc. When questioned, Zhou confessed that he was from Jiangbei and that Xiu Lian often came to my shop. On the afternoon of that day, she came again and went up to the loft. I once reached into her pants with my hand and touched her lower body, but I did not rape her, etc. Subsequently, according to Xiu Lian's confession, at that time, I went up to the loft, and Zhou first took off my pants, and then he also took off his pants, and then he committed rape. I screamed, and he slapped my cheeks. Judge Ge Zhitian, in order to prove whether rape had actually occurred, specially ordered the police to escort Zhou and Xiu Lian to the forensic examination room. After a detailed examination by the forensic doctor for a long time, the police brought the two people to the case, and the forensic doctor reported that two places on Xiu Lian's genitals were injured, but the hymen was still intact. Zhou Zicai's glans was red and swollen, and he did commit an act of adultery. The court then ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing to another date and appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant so that he could enjoy legal benefits.</p>

<p>Mother-in-law and Landlord Are Suspicious</p>
<p>Liang Renkang Avoids Appearing in Court</p>
<p>Zhu Wanrong, 45 years old, from Zhenjiang, is currently a partner at the Shenchengcang Tea and Food Shop in Xiaodongmen. He is suing his wife, Jiang, for adultery with Liang Renkang, a firefighter's chauffeur. Jiang is 36 years old and married Zhu in September of the Xuantong year. She has one son, 12 years old. Zhu was originally a partner at the Yishouhe Tea and Food Shop in Suzhou. On January 1 of this year, he suddenly received a letter from his wife, Jiang, from Shanghai, which revealed her intention to divorce Zhu. It was the end of the lunar year, and the shop was busy, so he could not return home to investigate. In early February, Zhu came to Shanghai, but when he arrived at his home at No. 9 Nanyang Bridge, it was already deserted. After questioning the second landlord, Fang, he learned that Jiang had been secretly living in the stove room of the house. Since then, through inquiries from various parties, the testimony of neighbors such as Zhu Wanzhong, Zhang Wanchun, and Fang Luo, etc., proved that Jiang and Liang Renkang had an affair. His mother-in-law, Chen, and the second landlord were suspected of being matchmakers. Recently, Liang brazenly occupied Jiang and moved to Lane 2, Daodeli, Hongkou, and jointly established the Taifeng Old Iron Shop at the intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Zhoushan Road, appearing as husband and wife. Therefore, Zhu could no longer bear it and filed a criminal lawsuit. On the morning of the previous day, the court opened, and Liang Renkang avoided appearing in court. The plaintiff stated the circumstances of his wife being occupied by Liang, and the witness, the second landlord, Fang, was also summoned to court and denied that he had hidden the plaintiff's wife in the stove room. She said that the plaintiff and his wife moved in in June of last year, and his wife had moved out in December, and she was unaware of her adulterous behavior with Liang. Subsequently, according to the defendants Zhu and Jiang, after marrying Zhu, because Zhu liked gambling, she never received a penny from him. The family's expenses were always earned by my own hands. By the end of last year, I really could not afford the rent, so I moved to the Taifeng Old Iron Shop opened by my brother and stayed there temporarily. I did not know Liang, etc. Judge Sun instructed both parties to leave and adjourned the hearing for seven days to investigate further.</p>

<p>Difficult to Marry a Concubine with a Fierce Wife</p>
<p>Chen Yongqing, from Huzhou, is a sugar and dried goods peddler. He lives in Shijia Lane, Nanshi. Chen is 50 years old and has no children. His wife only gave birth to two daughters, so Chen entrusted someone to find a young woman as a concubine to continue the family line. In February of this year, a laundress introduced him to Xuefeng, the daughter of Shen Akun, who worked at a wood shop in Nanshi Wharf, as a concubine. He paid 400 yuan for the marriage. After she entered the family, they initially rented a place in Tongkang Lane outside Xiaobeimen. Chen's first wife saw that her husband did not return home to sleep and questioned him. Chen, knowing that his wife had a violent temper, hid the truth and answered that he was busy with business. Chen's wife inquired everywhere and did not learn that her husband had a concubine until last month. Chen's wife was often furious and quarreled with her husband, followed by wrestling and fighting. The daughters persuaded them to stop. Chen, fearing that his wife would learn their address, moved Xuefeng to Tingyun Lane, Nanyang Bridge. Chen's wife was very angry and entrusted a neighbor to spend two yuan to secretly follow her husband to the place where he was hiding his lover. Not until the day before did she learn the address. The night before, she gathered her brothers and sisters and went to Tingyun Lane. After entering the house, she saw her husband and concubine having dinner. Chen's wife was even more angry and threw the bowls and plates all over the floor. She also slapped Xuefeng. Chen tried to stop her, but his wife grabbed him, weeping and refusing to let go. Seeing that Chen's wife was extremely fierce, Xuefeng escaped through the back door and ran to her parents. Chen's wife instructed her brother to hire a moving truck, move all the belongings in Chen's concubine's room to her home, and drag her husband away together. Xuefeng's father went to the Tingyun Lane address with his daughter yesterday and found that all the belongings were gone. He then contacted the matchmaker to negotiate with Chen, but it is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Strange Tales of Youthful Swindlers <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Young People Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>Recently, in Nanshi and other places, a kind of petty thief, about 20 years old, has been discovered. They suddenly have whimsical ideas to lure and deceive young children living at home. For those who are the same age as them, they design to coax and lure them, saying that hundreds of apprentices are wanted in a certain place. The monthly salary can be more than 40 yuan, and food and accommodation are provided. Don't miss such a good opportunity. If anyone is willing, our colleagues and I will be setting off, and you can also go with us. However, this matter cannot be told to parents, or they may obstruct it, and losing this benefit would be a pity. Unaware children mistakenly believe it to be true and all agree to follow. They even secretly take property from home and pool their travel expenses. When they arrive at the dock to meet him, he says that since you have collected your travel expenses, it is inconvenient to carry them on your body. Why not give them to me for safekeeping? At this time, the children trust him quite a bit, so they willingly give them to him. After boarding the ship, just as the ship is about to set sail, he takes advantage of the opportunity to sneak back to the dock with the money and flee without a trace. At this point, the children realize they have been deceived, but the ship has already set sail. It is too late to regret. Therefore, after arriving at the other port, they pawn their clothes for money and take a ship back to Shanghai, crying in vain. For example, on the 14th of this month, two sons, one from the Mou family on Xiaonanmen Street and the Zhao family in Yujia Lane, were lured to Ningbo by such people. Without relatives and no money, they ended up pawning their clothes for food and returning home. Afraid of their fathers and brothers scolding them, they did not return immediately. Lingering until they could no longer manage, they returned on a ship the day before yesterday. Their parents, who had been in a panic, were shocked to learn the truth after questioning their children. They could only sigh. The strangeness of the swindle is truly incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Eighty Bolts Sent to the Hotel</p>
<p>Obtained Money All the Way to the Bund</p>
<p>Attempted to Escape but Was Seized by a Friend</p>
<p>The Original Stolen Goods Were Not Found in the Hotel</p>
<p>Wu Yichang and Sun Jinsheng conspired with Li, who is on the run, on the 5th of this month to defraud the Huasi Ge Factory opened by Qu Jingdong in the French Concession of eighty bolts of Minghua Ge worth 774 yuan. After the case occurred, only Wu and Sun were arrested, but the original stolen goods had been taken away by their accomplice Li and had fled without a trace. The Public Security Bureau sent Wu and Sun to the French Court the day before yesterday to be investigated. The plaintiff complained about the previous situation, stating that the two defendants in the case came that day, pretending to be customers buying goods. At that time, they ordered eighty bolts of Minghua Ge and instructed them to send the goods to Room 73 of the Jiangdong Hotel in Xin Kaihe, Xiaodongmen, to collect the money. The merchant believed it to be true and sent partner Han Shiquan to deliver the goods. When he arrived at the hotel, Wu claimed that the goods had been placed in the hotel and took him to Dadongmen to collect the money. Han followed him. Unexpectedly, he went to Dadongmen, detoured through several places, and then went to the Bund, trying to escape. Therefore, he was seized by Han and taken to the Public Security Bureau, which sent detectives to the hotel to retrieve the stolen goods. Unexpectedly, it had been taken away by their accomplice Li, who had fled without a trace. Only the accomplice Sun Jinsheng was arrested and requested to be severely investigated. When questioned, Wu Qunchang admitted that the conspiracy was actually initiated by Li, who is on the run. Now the goods have been taken away by Li, who has fled. Sun Jinsheng confessed that although the people knew Wu, they did not dare to conspire to defraud. Judge Zhu sentenced Wu to three months in a Western prison and Sun to one month as a warning.</p>

<p>After the Ningbo compatriots learned that the Siming Public Cemetery intended to rebuild houses on the tomb area in Beifuli, they unanimously opposed it. They had formed a temporary tomb protection assembly at No. 901 Dong Hanbi Road and sent a letter to the Siming Public Cemetery requesting a joint inspection.

At that time, the land was excavated and inspected one by one. It was found that more than ten tombs had already been excavated. Later, due to time constraints, they could not wait and continued to investigate. It was confirmed by both parties that the land was indeed a charitable tomb. In the future, all charitable tombs must be replanted with grass and trees, and mounds of soil must be built, similar to foreign cemeteries, to ensure permanence. The land was measured on the spot, and it was discovered that a large area had been encroached upon. The people who occupied the land are being investigated so that they can be ordered to demolish their houses and return the land to protect public property.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Woman Demands Marital Autonomy <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xiaoyingzi, a woman from Yangzhou, is now 20 years old. She has retained lawyer Zhang Ding to petition the Local Court to request a judgment granting her marital autonomy and ordering her parents, Yang Changqi and Yang Wu, to cease their control over her marriage. Her petition stated that the plaintiff lost her mother when she was nine years old. Before three years had passed, the plaintiff's father remarried Wu. The stepmother initially pretended to be loving, but after Wu gave birth, she treated the plaintiff like a thorn in her side. She initially abused her, and when the father saw it and could not bear it, he intervened. Wu then made a lot of noise. The father witnessed the plaintiff being abused by Wu, even to the point of broken bones and torn tendons, but he had no ability to protect her. This has been going on for ten years. Now that the plaintiff has grown up, Wu's treatment of the plaintiff is slightly better on the surface, but in reality, she is taking revenge through various manipulations, such as in the matter of marriage. The plaintiff is embarrassed to mention this and is reluctant to trouble you. However, for the sake of the plaintiff's lifelong happiness, she has no choice but to petition for marital autonomy. The case was heard in court by Judge Tong Shenglü the day before yesterday. The plaintiff, Yang Xiaoyingzi, recounted the events. When the defendants, Yang Changqi and Yang Wu, were questioned, they denied the abuse. The judge ruled that the case required further evidence and ordered the hearing to be adjourned until further evidence could be presented and a decision could be made.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Zhou Shi Cancels Engagement Lawsuit <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Cheng Yun (the niece of Zhou Wanpeng, the former chief of the telegraph bureau) of Dachang Town, Baoshan, has a third daughter named Wen Lan. In the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], Sun Wenzhen introduced her to Shi Weigao's son, Lixun, for marriage. However, Lixun demanded that Zhou's daughter continue her studies and graduate from elementary school. However, Zhou Cheng Yun said that all his daughters had only graduated from primary school, and he could not make an exception for his third daughter. Despite repeated persuasion from the matchmaker and friends, there was no result. Last spring, Shi Lixun wrote to Zhou's father, saying that if she did not go to school as agreed, he would cancel the engagement. As a result, misunderstandings arose. Later, Shi's father set a date for the wedding and personally went to Zhou's father to apologize. However, Zhou strongly opposed Shi's request and hired lawyer Yu Congdao to sue the Local Court for damages. Shi also hired lawyers Wang Zengxian and Yuan Xilian to counterclaim for the return of the betrothal gifts. The case was heard in court by Judge Zhang Jinjian on the morning of the day before yesterday. Shi's son was absent due to illness, but all others were present. After the judge questioned Zhou's father and daughter and Shi Weigao to clarify the facts, he advised them to reconcile. Zhou Cheng Yun said that his daughter had to make her own decision. Zhou Wenlan said that she did not want to marry Shi Lixun because she had already sent a letter of cancellation. However, Shi Weigao said that he did not want to cancel the engagement. If Zhou Wenlan insisted on canceling, she would have to return the betrothal gifts and compensate for the losses. The judge ruled that reconciliation was impossible and ordered the debate to begin. Lawyer Yu, representing the plaintiff, stated that the cancellation had been made by Shi Lixun in his letter and that Zhou Wenlan had agreed. What they were now requesting was compensation for losses such as the cost of the banquet, totaling 300 yuan, and 800 yuan for emotional distress. Lawyer Wang, representing the defendant, argued that the cancellation required a procedure. The simplest was for the man to return the engagement card and the woman to return the betrothal gifts. In this case, the engagement had not been legally canceled, so how could they directly seek compensation for losses? Shi Lixun's letter was intended to urge Zhou Wenlan to study. The plaintiff had confiscated the material gifts, which were of value, but had not attached importance to the engagement card, which was of great significance to the woman, and had not sought its return, which was inconsistent with the law and human feelings and should be rejected. The case was judged yesterday. The plaintiff's claim for damages and the defendant's counterclaim for the return of the betrothal gifts were both rejected.</p>

<p>Where Exactly is Ms. Jin?</p>
<p>Chen Yang, a 56-year-old woman from Ningbo, lives at No. 56 Darang Lane, South Wharf. Her son, Buqing, is over 20 years old. In the eighth year of the Republic [1919], she hired Zhu Jiqing as a matchmaker to marry the daughter of Jin Ronggui, a fellow villager who runs the Jindexing copper shop at No. 216 Dongjiadu, as her daughter-in-law. After she entered the family, the relationship between the couple was fairly good. The day before yesterday, Ms. Jin had an argument with her aunt for trivial reasons, which was later resolved by persuasion. After lunch, Ms. Jin said she was going out for water and disappeared. The family searched everywhere but could not find her. Before long, someone said that his daughter-in-law had run back to her mother's house, so he went to her father, Jin Ronggui, to ask for her back. However, Jin said, "My daughter is your daughter-in-law. If you say she is missing, you must have sold her." The family was desperate and had no choice but to rush to the relevant sub-precinct of the first district to request an investigation. The sub-precinct director ruled that the case was complicated and asked them to temporarily withdraw to await a thorough investigation by patrol officers before further action could be taken.</p>

<p>The home of Kang Tinggui, a wealthy businessman in Xixiang, Guan Port, South Shanghai, was suddenly visited by several robbers around 7 PM the day before yesterday. They knocked on the door and asked for his name. Kang's wife, not suspecting anything, opened the door. The robbers rushed in, brandishing guns and threatening them to keep quiet. Kang's wife shouted, but her mouth was stuffed with cotton, and Kang and the others were driven into the kitchen under guard. The robbers entered the room and searched for valuables. Finding no silver dollars, they dragged Kang into the room and forced him to reveal the location of the hidden money. When he refused, they slashed his shoulder with a knife. Kang, in excruciating pain, had to reveal the location. The robbers stole over 300 yuan in silver dollars, gold rings, gold hairpins, and twenty or thirty silk and leather garments, tied them into a bundle, and fled with the stolen goods. Yesterday, Kang came to the newspaper office after seeking medical treatment and reported the robbery to the police precinct for investigation.</p>

<p>Song Lusheng, 45, a local resident of No. 52 Beiqu Lane, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, worked as a carpenter for a living. He had an apprentice named Jin Yazi, 17, a local resident, who had come to him through a friend's introduction two years ago, in the autumn. He was usually diligent and well-behaved. His family only had an elderly mother, who hoped to rely on him in the future. Unexpectedly, yesterday around 10:30 AM, the apprentice secretly went to the Wangjia Pond near that place to bathe and wash away the sweat due to the hot weather. He drowned because he did not know how to swim. Song, surprised by the apprentice's absence, inquired among his neighbors, who said they had not seen him. Song searched everywhere. A villager caught sight of a body floating in the pond. He told Song, who rushed to the pond and found it was his apprentice. He tried to rescue him, but he was already dead. He immediately sent someone to report to his family. Song also reported the incident to the Guangfu Road Police Station in the Sixth District, which was forwarded by Officer Wu to the Sixth District Police Department for record.</p>

<p>The Jishiang Canal sluices and other projects of the Chinese Jishiang Canal of Henan Province in Qixian have been completed. The canal is more than 40 li long and can irrigate thousands of acres of fertile land. The benefits are the best in the entire province of Henan. This has been reported in the previous newspaper. Now we have received a letter from Mr. Dong Xiangqu, who initiated the project in Qixian. A few months ago, the Henan Provincial Relief Association sent Mr. Liu Xuxin to Qixian to inspect the canal project. He was very satisfied with the large-scale, cost-effective, and highly profitable project. The large stone bridge of the canal's dam was too large and required extra processing and materials, which slightly increased the cost. The project has recently been completed, but there are still unpaid wages that are urgently needed. The local area is barren and there is no way to borrow money. Therefore, the association was asked to borrow 2,000 yuan, which would be repaid after the autumn harvest. The association agreed that this large-scale project was beneficial to the people and approved the loan of 2,000 yuan to meet the urgent need. The funds have been remitted in full for urgent use.</p>

<p>Chapter 47: The American Novel</p>
<p>Mark Twain is the most original and profound American writer of all America. Howells called him the Lincoln of American literature. No other writer can compare with him in the scope of his knowledge, the knowledge he has digested and pondered, and his understanding of the variety and diversity of American life. He was born in Missouri, which was central-western and half-southern. He lived in California for a short while and in New York and Connecticut for many years. He travelled the world and knew all kinds of people and their circumstances. The idea that his wings were clipped and the dignity of American life prevented his genius from fully expressing itself is meaningless, a kind of notion recently popular among young critics. No writer was more suited to introduce the country in which he lived, and no country has ever had a writer more prepared to introduce it. He said everything he should have said, and he knew the art of saying it, and the surrounding things nurtured his genius.</p>
<p>He began as a journalist in Nevada and California, gaining a local reputation as a humorist. His newspaper sent him as a correspondent to travel in Europe and the Holy Land. His correspondence became his first important work, "The Innocents Abroad." This is not a comic book. It has a lot of humor. Some of the humor is inevitably shallow, but most of it is honest, independent genuine observation and reports of practical experience.  The genuine segments are written in excellent prose. He discovered in some segments that, as he grew older and became more enlightened and reflective, he was accompanied by a developing aesthetic awareness. There has never been a better travel correspondent than him. His sharp eyes saw through everything. He had the genius to understand any scene and to communicate it. This special talent was demonstrated in the later "A Tramp Abroad" and "Following the Equator." In fiction, his masterpiece is "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn." This stands alone in his works, because "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer" is incomparable to it, although Mark Twain, who had no critical knowledge, seemed to prefer the smaller work to the larger one. "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" also stands alone in American literature. There is nothing similar to it in the scope of the scene and in the variety of the story's interest. If one simply thinks of vastness, then this is not isolated in world literature, because there is at least one great humorous novel of vagrancy and adventure called "Don Quixote" that can be compared. "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" is not just a story for young people, and although young readers read it as they love reading "Gulliver's Travels," not knowing where the deep meaning lies, this is not a book for children. Through Huck's innocent eyes, we see the entirety of civilization (or what civilization lacks). We gain an almost epic perspective on the center of American history and the geographical center of that country.  In Mark Twain's light-hearted works, there is much humor and sharp observation of characters, but there are also signs of imbalance, restlessness, and impatience, as if there were missteps in the production.  Almost all the value of "Pudd'nhead Wilson" lies in the "Calendar" which Mark Twain continued to use as titles for chapters of other books, and in the most acute and magnificent aphorisms that have ever been uttered. In "Joan of Arc," which can be considered a novel, there is much beauty and lasting taste. However, the best above all (after Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) are two satirical novels, "The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg" and the wonderful fable published after his death, "The Mysterious Stranger." Mark Twain had the talent for astonishing accusations, the stinging indignation, and the chilling ability to mock what he hated, like Swift's acerbity, mixed with pity, a deep Swiftian acerbity.  Often, he is most cruel when he laughs the loudest. "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," on the surface, is a somewhat loose comedy with a humorous flavor, but at its core, it is a study of democracy and a violent attack on the folly of mankind. There, Mark Twain expressed the desire to hang all mankind.</p>
<p>He is a great pamphleteer with that astonishing talent for pointing out faults, intense indignation, and a chilling way of mocking what he hates. Readers who ignore his repeatedly published protest essays are missing one of his most magnificent and admirable aspects. Much of Mark Twain's humor has gradually lost its vitality. This may be true. Some, without his other works to sustain their life, are fleeting and destined to be forgotten. However, the genuine Mark Twain is a truly immortal classic, no less than any prose writer of the same century. When he speaks directly from his heart, as in "Life on the Mississippi," without the interference of any traditional literary forms, he is a master of style. He is our laurelled prose writer of democracy – he would probably say everything about democracy.</p>
<p>On one side, the Californian side, linked to Mark Twain is Bret Harte. He developed the life of the pioneers of the West Coast for the enjoyment of readers on the East Coast, and he did it brilliantly. His gamblers and miners are sentimentalized. He seems to have learned something from the most flawed part of Dickens's genius. However, he wrote beautiful prose. He knew the art of the short story, and he was clever in his approach to romantic emotions. He was extremely prolific. Most of his works have been forgotten. However, novels like "The Luck of Roaring Camp" are still fresh. One of his works, I believe, will not be forgotten, because it is excellent humor and first-rate indirect literary criticism. That work is the two-volume "Condensed Novels."</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e176">Her News, Sweet Grass <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Written by He Yubo</p>
<p>Published by Modern Bookstore</p>
<p>In the recent literary scene, we don't see any new works that are worth noting. Yesterday, I saw this book of creations in the library, and it immediately made me feel infinitely soaring. With a light, clear, tactful and graceful pen, it depicts several poignant stories. I find this book satisfactory.</p>
<p>Inside are eight short stories. The author's style is very delicate and refined. The first one is "Birds of the Same Fate," which depicts a young student who falls in love with a prostitute. Later, the student becomes impoverished and desperate, and is mistreated by the madam in a foreign land. However, the prostitute genuinely loves him. Later, the prostitute argues with the madam and commits suicide. At the same time, the poor, desperate, and with no way out, the student falls ill in the hospital. He sees this news in the newspaper and also embraces death, leaving the real world.</p>
<p>This piece expresses deep sympathy for the modern youth's distress, sexual expression, and people groaning in the vortex of the times. When the rosy dream is shattered by poverty, the past pavilion suddenly disappears, how does the heart regret itself? The student and the prostitute argue and then go to their desolate residence, where they have self-reflection and affirmative repentance.</p>
<p>A brothel can no longer be considered a person, but a machine for manufacturing flesh. They have to treat guests insincerely for money. In fact, it is difficult to blame them. They are just like mules and horses pulling carts on the road, only for others to drive.</p>
<p>A pimp is like the cargo on a cart. The shopkeeper and head of the brothel are like merchants or capitalists. The aunts, fellows, and other people are like the servants who drive the cart. In this situation, how can the pimp get any comfort from the brothel, which is like a mule and horse? He is just sitting on the cart, unknowingly creating a lot of profit for the merchants or capitalists who use women as mules and horses. If this kind of cargo has no profit to be made, they will not transport it either.</p>
<p>This analogy is very apt and can make people understand the real situation in the brothel.</p>
<p>The second is "Leaving Beijing," which is the sorrow of parting when leaving the capital city. At the same time, it vividly reveals the modern people's hard life. The third is "Regimental Commander's Wife." The cruelty of the warlords. The warlords are bandits. It is written very painfully. Killing and looting, breaking up young unmarried couples, and forcibly occupying other people's wives. The fourth is "Bankruptcy," which describes the poor social organization and the suffering of the people caused by the warlords, making a lively young person step into society and unable to find a good job. It is like a cruel sword that turns a good family into utter ruin. At the same time, it gives deep sympathy to the vicissitudes of life and the coldness of human feelings. The fifth is "After the Divorce." This piece is about the love of a rural elementary school teacher. This piece has received such criticism from Zhao Jingshen and is indeed worthy of praise and exclamation.</p>
<p>Zhao Jingshen said in the third section of the first preface:</p>
<p>If we compare "After the Divorce" with "Regimental Commander's Wife," "Leaving Beijing," "Bankruptcy," "Her News," "Suicide," "Election" and other pieces, we will be even more surprised. A novel depicting love in a rural setting like "After the Divorce" can be compared to Wang Jingzhi's "Jesus's Instructions" and Xu Jie's "Neighbors." Whether in structure or diction, it is very pleasing. If we look at the author's date of birth, we will know that "After the Divorce" is the most recent piece, which shows that the author has made rapid progress in skills. According to such a progress ratio, I think Mr. He's future is unlimited. Even if there is only this one piece, "After the Divorce," it has already made us very satisfied.</p>
<p>The sixth is "Her News." Living as a guest in a foreign land, separated for seven years, revisiting the old place, thinking of the past, thinking of the love with the girl in those years. Now, after seven years, I don't know what her news is. Looking at the vast waters of Dongting Lake, it seems like the graceful figure when bidding farewell in those years, leaving behind a song of lovesickness. The rhythm of emotion and the power of skill give people a resonance.</p>
<p>Flow, water, flow!</p>
<p>Flow away my youth,</p>
<p>Flow away my lover,</p>
<p>How can it not flow away my sorrow and anger,</p>
<p>How can it not flow away her graceful figure?</p>
<p>Flow, water, flow!</p>
<p>May it flow me to her hometown,</p>
<p>May it flow me to her side,</p>
<p>Allow me to see her,</p>
<p>I would like to sleep forever in your heart.</p>
<p>The seventh, "Suicide," is the sadness of the prostitute herself, and the first one also expresses extremely genuine sympathy for the buying and selling of current sexual desire. The eighth, "Election," this piece put a fatal blow to the unreasonable representative politics. The local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside are extremely skilled at playing tricks in the election.</p>
<p>The novel is neither a pile of facts, nor is it just a beautiful screen woven with words, it is the art of life. This cannot be denied. Now, most writers either specialize in piling up their own romances, or wholeheartedly weave brocade of words. They do not know that the author should have great sympathy for all things, and from this produce correct ideas, so that appropriate words can become beautiful works.</p>
<p>The author of this book has an extremely serious, earnest, and sincere attitude towards creation. If he continues to work hard like this, he can hope to achieve great success in the future.</p>
