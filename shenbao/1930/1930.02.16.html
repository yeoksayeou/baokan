<p>時評</p>
<h3>從國際貿易上觀察海會</h3>
<p>此次五大强國海軍會議之關係。吾人從國際貿易总競爭之情勢言之。可分太平洋與大西洋兩方面觀察。太平洋方面。英美與日之關係爲多。目光皆注射於中國之市埸。近日報載英美日間對巡艦間題。競爭甚劇。外電所謂英美聯合制日者。即從太平洋方面言之也。大西洋方面。英美與法之關係爲切。法自戰勝以後代德而興。工業日盛。在歐洲大陸市場。早成爲英國之一勁敵。故於德賠欵問題。曾起劇烈之抗爭。在英保守黨内閣時代。力主聯法抗美。日内瓦會議。即因爭海權而破裂。英法成立海軍協定。同時美國亦有擴張大巡艦計劃之表示。於是大西洋風雲。驟見一度險惡。然至去年工黨二次組閣後。外交政策。一反前内閣主張。而力主聯美。對法亦非如前内閣之親密。吾人觀於連日海車會議中之法代表。對英美潛艇巡艦等提案。力表反對。其態度之堅决。幾與日代表無異蛛絲馬跡。可見一斑。至英與意大利。外交上本甚接近。此次意代表在海軍會議。力主與法有同等之海軍力。其用意自亦有所在也。</p>
<p>故從太平洋與大西洋兩面觀察。可以窺測此次海軍會議之情勢。今日日電謂英美日法四全權。各自發表覺書或聲明書。以促會議之進行。實則距離仍遠。蓋四國之意見。懸隔太甚。日來已至中心點之接觸。該會成功與否。全視此数日内各國讓步之誠意何如也。</p>

<p>英法美海軍專家討論噸數問題</p>
<p>根據法國備忘錄</p>
<p>日本無抛棄七成要求意</p>
<p>海會或將延至三月中旬</p>
<p>▲路透社十四日倫敦電英法美三國海軍專家今晨集議兩小時、討論噸數、以法國備忘錄爲根據、全體大會何時舉行、尙未議及、英法美日四方面之噸数　額、先必求出、某消息靈敏者謂海會之地位、幾類字謎、現有人估料五强海會將拖延至三月中旬、法總理泰狄歐與外長白里安今晨已起程返巴黎、泰狄歐語路透訪員、謂噸數重要問題之討論、現甫開始、何亟亟爲</p>
<p>▲路透社十五日東京電英報因日本答案中未言及七成比率、遂料日本可抛棄此次要求、其實日本並無此意、且本月十三日日本備忘錄中所載之提議辦法、固明明在各種輔助艦及大巡艦上按照美十日七之比率編製也、據可恃方面、日本所提出之甲乙兩種辦法、其噸數與昨傳者略有出入、兹將實在數字列後、（甲）「大巡艦」美一八○·○○○噸、日一二六·○○○噸、「小巡艦」美一四七·○○○噸、日八一·七○○噸、「膒逐艦」美一五○·○○○噸、日一○五·○○○噸、「潛艇」美八一·○○○噸、日七七·九○○噸、（乙）「大巡艦」美一五○·○○○、日一○八·四○○噸、「小巡艦」美一八九·○○○噸、日一○七·七○○噸、「驅逐艦及潛艇」與甲同、如美國依其二月五日之提議、僅願有潛艇六○·○○○噸、則美國儘可將餘剩二一·○○○噸移入驅逐艦類、而成一七一·○○○噸、惟日本須保持潛艇七七·九○○噸、</p>
<p>▲電通社十五日東京電日本海軍之一部、關於倫敦會議之前途、以各國主張相隔懸遠、恐難成立妥協、早已持悲觀論調、蓋照現在情形、倘英美兩國承認法國總噸數四十二萬噸之要求、則無詞拒絶日本之要求、故英美兩國、須先以抑制法國要求爲先决條件、其竭全力於對法交涉、即以此故、惟照旣定方針進行不肯更改之法國、是否樂從、殊爲疑問、視今後形勢如何、前途未許樂觀、因此日本對英美之接近、亦感非常之困難云、</p>
<h3>韓督宣佈統治韓國方針</h3>

<p>於日人意想之外、新任朝鮮總督齊藤實氏、於本月五日招集日僑代表三十餘名、商洽統治方針、並徵求日僑方面之意見、繼復召集總督府各要人密議各項問題、遂於九日宣布新政策、其大要如下、（一）獎勵朝鮮固有之漢學、提倡儒敎、以資防止新思潮之浸染、（二）學校敎育應加澈底改革、注重實業、（三）官立學校入學應加限制、負担年税二百元以上者、得有入學資格、（四）實施地方自治、應由城市地方開始、各地方自治圑體、由日韓人共同組織、在自治圑體中有選舉及被選舉權者、應限於有三千元以上財産者、（五）制定取締私立學校法、不許濫設、（六）制定取締满洲及外國鮮人之警律、防止其活動及宣傳、上述各項政策宣布後、韓人方面與論大爲憤慨、各地學生示威更加猛烈、城市方面官立學校多已宣告廢止、而地方私立學校繼城市學生而起、全國學校中仍無一校開課云</p>

<h3>西班牙政局紊亂</h3>
<p>國王遭社會黨抨擊</p>
<p>一時難上憲政常軌</p>
<p>▲路透社十四日瑪德里電、西班牙實業界爭端時起、而國王復爲人攻擊、致貝倫圭將軍導國家人於憲法軌道之工作、愈臻困難、社會黨當前爲唯一有組織的政黨、此爲甚紊亂政局中之唯一正確事實、社會黨現將對於里夫拉將軍之抨擊、移施於國王、國人聞前狄克推多有濫用威權、措施不當、濫費公欵等情、輿情頗爲激昂、舊有政黨現擬改組、但因領袖無人、進行不易、目前政治無台、爲自由黨領袖烏南律摩·與共和黨領袖勒白羅·二人所據有、彼等刻對國王加以嚴酷抨擊、政府現訓令京都市政局趕辦公共工程、吸收失業人民、以期阻止變亂之復作、咋夜巴塞洛拉警察、驅散投石搗毀爱國會總部之暴動、</p>
<h3>日本總選競爭益烈</h3>

<p>▲電通社十五日東京電、選舉干涉與壓迫、表面上雖係嚴禁、然各地頗以巧妙之手段行之、演説之際、命其注意或中止者、其例甚多、如鑛山地方、公司派人守於會場入口、阻止鑛工入演説會塲、官吏視若無覩、又運動員常以極薄弱之理由被拘、並對其散布傳單、加以妨害、無産黨列舉上述許多事實、向内務省抗議、</p>
<p>▲電通社十五日東京電、幣原外相今晩由東京赴大阪、在該地爲民政候補之應援演説、於明後日歸京、其他黨出身閣員政務官等、大抵全部轉戰各地、並致勗勉之電於各方、以鞏固戰線、蓋民政黨欲獲得二百五十名議席、正在奮鬥中云、</p>

<p>香港體育恊進會因藉華東隊在港之便、組織華東南足球聯隊、與本港最强盛之海軍足球隊比賽、欲表演我國健兒之足球藝術而向外示威也、以該聯隊之人物而論、雖因吳錦泉曹桂成未能出塲、陳鎭和已回滬去、仍未能謂爲已全以華東南所有之精鋭人物應戰、然爲勢亦至强盛、况開賽時、後衛又已改用馮運佑、與李天生合力鞏衛後方、在事實上言　則如斯陣勢、已爲現在港中之華東南聯隊所能出之最佳聯隊矣、然而此中乃有最不幸之隠事、爲記者六日所探知、而不能为以告閲者諸君者、蓋林玉英正患咳、黄瑞又適有河魚之疾、李天生李惠堂葉北華則俱因連日劇戰、足部俱有隠傷、故未能盡量施展其所抱藝術、而卒致於敗也、雖然吾人旣觀是日之戰後、實不能不承認海軍藝術之優良、而我隊之缺乏聯絡術也、按日之戰、初賽時雙方均極敏捷、兩隊前鋒俱不攻近球門則已、近則必令對方驚險、華隊於上半塲有極有佳之表演、所以未能取勝者、實因聯絡未足、及海軍之一對後衛有特殊之佳良表故然、至於下半塲、則海軍幾盡佔上風、華隊甚少有攻過海軍後衛線之機會、若非最後因陳光耀得機傳中、李惠堂拚命射回一球、則華隊真不難嘗光蛋滋味、又倘非得陳錫培奮勇救險多次、則所負富不只二球已也、雙方名單　　如下、</p>

<p>第四張</p>
<p>表這篇告全國軍人書、一定因爲國内還有反側的軍人在那裏希圖搗亂、從那封信裏我們可以得了幾點感想、第一、我們曉得、國家和平基礎、是建築在什麽地方、一個國家之内、如果要和平、如果要没有内亂、定要一心一德、共同有一個主義、一個主張、人人在那裏爲國家作事情、爲民衆謀幸福、要上下都有這樣信律、國家和平、才能運築得很穏固、在上面的人、要以誠意待人、處處以民族利益爲前提、在下級的人、也應以國家爲前提、以廉　道德節氣來互相勉勵、做軍人的人、也應以服從犧牲爲唯一的責任、以遵守主義、不爲利誘、不爲威屈、擁護中央、這樣一來、國家的和平、才能獲得、眞正的和平、才能眞正實現、眞正的和平是從擁護中央中得出來的、如果各個人儘量在打自已的算盤、國家的和平、是永久不會實現的、第二、我們曉得、和平是有眞有假的、的許多人、以和平爲招牌、以和平爲護身符、實際上是欺騙人民實際上是在破壞和平他們希望中國不統一、希望中國亂七八糟、然後他們以維持和平的口氣、來發　個人的野心、這種人簡直和以前軍閥時代那些替軍閥奔走和平的政客、還要可惡、這種人所提倡的、是假的和平、但是我們需要的、是眞的永久的和平、應該在擁護中央政府之下、實現眞正的和平、應該在民衆和利益之下、實現永久的和平如果以相安一時、而實際割據各方的、算爲和平、我們是絶對不需要的、第三、國家設官吏的目的、是要替百姓做事情、不是爲少數人找地盤更不是作酬勞的東西、誰是勞苦功高、便酬給他們、官吏是人民的公僕、就是受國家的任命、受人民的委託、就應當替人民謀利益、爲國家作事情、對於中央政府、决定的政策、無論那個官吏、除了絶對服從之外、别無他路可走、但是現在中國的官吏、是如何呢、那些貪官汚吏、固然不必説、還有許多官吏表面上是受了政府的委任、實際上處處和政府搗蛋、這種官吏、對國家不忠信對人民不忠信眞是如何要得我們從官吏的不忠信上、就可以看出和平之不容易苟得要是宫吏違背了政府、而自行其事、就是無異造反、造反就是破壞和平、這是我們大家曉得的我們從國民政府五院長的告軍人書中、可以看出永久的和平、是要從擁護中央政府的條件之下、才能獲得、所以全國的官吏、必須以中央意志爲意志、絶對奉行中央政府的政策、共同努力、求得眞正永久有和平、所以我們負宣傳工作責任的同志們、在最近就應當本着這個意思、告訴民衆、使民衆都瞭目前的情况、這是今天第一點要告訴各位的、第二、現在有許多唱高調的人、一味抄着共産黨的方法、不負責任、濫唱高調、隨便講許多亂話、這是最可惡的事情、我們知道、在目前中國艱難困苦的情狀中、試問有幾個人、能支持危這個急的現狀、有幾個人能把危狀支持過來、以後再從事偉大的國家建設、恐怕除了我們的革命領袖蔣介石同志之外、没有第二個人、能負擔起這個責任吧、但是現在竟有許多人、不負責任的亂唱高調、瞎説什麽我們要學唐瞋三代時候的揖讓之風、使大家人民都學揖讓、這種高調、不但足以救中國、而且可使中國趕快滅亡、如果我們是一個中國國民黨的忠實黨員、就應當認清楚、這種高調、是希圖搖動黨國基礎的陰謀、和以前共産黨的末技是一樣的、誰在唱這種高調、便是希圖搖動黨國基礎、便不是我們的朋友、我們就應當以對付共産黨的方法來對待他們、革命黨只講是非、如果是應該我做的事情、無論人家駡我也好、説我戀棧也好、譏我出風頭也好、綠應當始終如一、不爲所動、革命黨不應當畏首畏尾、或貪生怕死、也不應當爲威所屈利所誘、更不是從前以對待軍閥的方法、便搖得動革命黨的責任心的、希望各们參酌今天報上蔣介石同志的談話·及兄弟剛才的報告·向民衆作切實的宣傳、使民衆知道革命與反革命的分别、明白革命黨做事是有預定計劃、决不中途變更或打消的、這一點非常重要、特别報告出來、請各位十分注意、第三、關於外交方面、也有一點報告、最近外交上、有兩件比較重要的事情、一件是中俄交涉問題、一件是臨時法院問題、臨時法院現在已經决定改組、并取消了許多不應該有的外人殊遇、總算已經告了一個段落、但是我們還要作更進一步的努力、從速收回租界、關於中俄問題、蔡運升的越權辱國、是不能辭其咎的在中東路事件本身講起來、周龍光也不能辭其咎、現在中央要把這個事情、糾正過來、所以把這些不能辭其咎的人、免職查辦同時派莫德惠爲代表、到莫斯科去商量中俄交涉、這是在中國外交史上、極大一件事情、關於中國主權及生死存亡很大、現在莫德惠將由京來滬、不日即將由上海到瀋陽轉赴莫斯科、在這時候、我們要喚起上海民衆以誠懇的意見、貢獻給莫德惠、希望莫德惠能够依照了民衆的意見去做、同時也可以曉得後面有民衆做後盾、儘可以放心的和俄人交涉、這一點、也希望各位能够向民衆宣傳、使民衆起來督促莫德惠、照着我們的意思去做、不再踏蔡運升周龍光等的覆輙、第四、國内經濟方面、最近因爲金貴銀賤風潮、發生很大的影響、中國現在幣制没有統一、也没有改兩爲元、没有改用金本位、所以在金貴銀賤風潮當衆、中國是影響最大的一國、所以物價大漲、舶來品都價高非凡、平民大受損失、民生上受到極大的害處、對於這一個問題、在政府方面、一方面有專門的機關與人才、他們可以想出許多法子、如統一幣制、改兩爲元、禁止現銀進口、和改用金奉位等等、但是人民方面、也有一件很　做而並無損害的事情、就是提倡國貨、如果我們能使全國人民、都用國貨、大家都有堅决的心、來　制舶來品　無論衣食住任何方面、都能用國貨、這樣一來、無論金如何貴·銀如何賤、决不會使國民經濟上發生極大的影響與損失、所以中央將提倡國貨、作爲下級黨部七項工作之一、現在正是一個努力宣傳的機會、所以希望各位能够向民衆宣傳、明天市宣傳部有一個提倡國貨的宣傳大會、希望各位不但自己能够參加、並且領導同志同胞、大家都能參加、第五、國際政治方面、最近有二件比較重要的事情、一件是倫敦海軍會議、一件是日本的總選舉、上次的倫敦會議、和以前列强的海單會議、性質可以説是相同的、完全是欺騙弱小民族的會議、有結果無結果、我們可以不必集中力量專心地去研究、反正這完全是列强變戲法而已、關於日本的總選舉、有人又在那裏作什麽夢想、以爲他們的國内政戰、會對我們中國有什麽影響、實際上、他們無論那一個黨執政、對華都是抱着侵略的政策、始終是我們的敵人、除非他們能够抛棄侵略的野心以後、才能變爲我們的友人、這是過去事實、已經告訴我們得很清楚、希望各位對於這些事情、能够認識淸楚、遇人有作夢想的時候、可以向他提醒及解釋一下、完了、</p>

<h3>淹城偶記</h3>
<p>— 湯修梅</p>
<p>毘陵城南十里而遙。有地名淹城者。土阜圍繞作圓形。内外兩重。儼類城敦。城之下。溪流如環。水面遼闊。澄澈可鑑。日内外城河。周圍凡五六里。僅西北角一徑可逹。入内。平野一片。阡陌交通。烟村二三。鷄犬相聞。景物淸幽。絶類桃源。正復有一小圓邱。廟宇數楹。傾覆可待。中列偶像數事。斷垣敗壁中。得石碑一。文雖剝蝕。隠約尙可辨。撫而讀之。蓋其地名紫羅城。行脚僧某。偶經斯土。喜其逈絶塵俗。堪爲靜修之所。遂募建殿宇而駐錫焉。登阜瞭望。覺地勢雄偉。頗似雛形之宮禁。邑紳盛宣懹氏。昔年曾擬購此枯廟之地。謀爲埋骨之所。卒因居民持異議。未果。曩聞鄕老曝暄聞話。言明末時有淹王者。因事逃逋至此。鑿土爲池。積土成城。耕食自給。據此困守。城北有高阜一。則王女墓也。城河水絶淵深。盛旱不竭。農田賴以灌溉。榖産特佳。魚類産生甚繁。每歲炎夏。嗚衆聚捕。必獲巨鱗。城内有陰森氣。陰雨時輒聞金鼓聲。其他神奇之談。類屬齊東野語。余於去年曾偕朋輩往游。時爲暮春之初。聲聲啼鶯。處處桃花。薰風欲醉。廬舍爲蔽。自顧此身。疑已爲武林漁夫。而環城一週後。復得一絶趣資料。供我記述。緣每行百餘武。輒見燼餘榖草。積灰成堆。一如測量之標記。異而詢之。始悉村中有女。出閣有期。嫁衣頗豐。一昨之夕。遂蒙樑上君子之光顧。搜取衣物實布袱中。方自穴隙蛇行出。遽爲主人覺。噪逐而出。村人聞聲。爭出相助。夜黑不可辨。因互取户外積薪燃之。遍燭全城。黠者更趨守當關。使爲甕中鼈。賊情急不得出。始盡棄所獲。泅水兩重而去。此灰燼之所由來也。斯時春氷未解。夜寒尤甚。緃得兎脱。亦大可憐。竊笑旣擅穿窬術。何處不可施其技。必欲來此絶境。自取敗亡。賊誠笨伯矣哉。</p>

<h3>懼内趣史</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>江南有兩句俗語。呌做「懼内家皆富。欺妻一世貧。」又道。「怕家婆。免淘氣。」足見「懼内」自有懼内的好處。在下有幾位朋友。都是高跟皮鞋下的征服者。也好算是懼内的名家。現在把他們「怕」的成績。寫些出來。不過閲者的夫人們。倘然見了。也要如法泡製。那末鄙人恕不負責。特此聲明。</p>
<p>Ａ君開着幾爿店舖。都是他一手經理。但對於牀頭細君。却無法駕馭。因此素有懼内之號。一天和他在筵席上相遇。見他面部上現着幾條紅線。爪痕殷然。衆人都笑着問道。你臉上畫的是什麽。他囁嚅着答道。這……是貓脚爪爪開的。衆都詫異道。怎麽貓兒會爬上你的臉上來呢。他道。偶然玩玩小貓。不料被它的脚爪刺破了。在下笑道。恐怕不是小貓的脚爪。是雌虎的脚爪吧。衆人都大笑起來。Ａ君面紅耳赤。他受不夫人的懲創也就此證實。　　Ｂ君是開設蠟燭店的。人家都叫他蠟燭小開。他對於夫人眞是言聽計從。一天到晚。拖男抱女。不辭勞瘁。原來他夫人雀興甚豪。終日在家裏雀戰。所以把這看護兒女的責任。完全交給伊丈夫。甚至夜間牀上發生了尿災。或是小兒女鬧着飢荒。都要他起身料理。他夫人却是運籌帷幄。高枕無憂。有時人家對Ｒ君説道。你這樣夜以繼日。未免太辛苦吧。他縐着眉道。男子以服從爲天職。伊呌我這樣。我實在無法可想。</p>
<p>Ｃ君夜間在外應酬。每滑脚先走。倘經諸友挽留。他總是喊着戒嚴。原來他的内務部曾有訓令。每夜至遲十時須回家。倘過了規定時間。就要以閉門羹相待。這時他做了門外漢。進退維谷。足足須站崗一小時。方得遇赦入房。他嘗過了這種滋味。所以奉命維謹。未敢或違。這是他酒後自供的。</p>
<p>Ｄ君的懼内。也是高人一等。他還有一種特長。就是每日要爲夫人盡梳頭的職務。凡各種時式髮髻。都能應手如意。一天在下淸晨往訪。恰見他和夫人做這上層工作。在下笑道。從前張敞畫眉。千古傳爲韻事。足下更進一層。艶褔眞不淺哉。Ｄ君也笑道。我這樣的服侍伊。倘然偶不合意。還要遭伊的呵斥。這種艶福。眞有些難受咧。他夫人聽了。對鏡嫣然一笑。好似表示伊芳心中的快慰。</p>
<h3>四五六春宴記</h3>
<p>— 阿凉生</p>
<p>四五六不知何所取義。南京路有食品公司焉。竟以四五六爲名。或以爲四五六之下爲七。七即吃之諧聲。然吾蘇人讀音。七爲尖音。吃屬團字。不能相混。楊淸磐畫師。浙之湖州人。尖團不分。自在意中但增時聆其歌曲。又尖團陰陽。淸晰可聽。當不至以七爲吃。或有其他命意在也。前日係四五六刷新後開幕之日。主人楊畫師柬邀海上文藝家數十人爲開刀利市。先至者有五一亭葉恭綽黄賓虹張善孖及茹素念佛之狄平子諸氏。圍聚圓桌。王一亭氏正爲主人作一佛像葉譽虎氏已寫成斗方兩幀。供置案左。時至七時狼虎會健將陳蠂仙小蠂父子墍周瘦鵑氏畫家鄭曼靑馬孟容錢瘦鐡賀天健。新聞報陳逹哉抗石君余空我等均至。或作畫。或留書。均以長不滿八寸闊約七寸之潔白紙版上做工夫。李浩然嚴獨鶴最後至。浩然先生山水極名貴。不輕易爲人著筆。是夕作山水一幀深遠古雅。同人爲之叫絶。余最愛錢瘦鐵鄭午昌二氏之山水張紅藢韓秀二女士之梅松。而葉譽虎氏之行書尤饒骨勁。有肅然起敬之感。主人亦提筆寫唐詩一首。凑成三十八幀。聞即以配成金框裝飾壁間之用。余笑謂主人日。食品公司而有此雅飾。可謂中國所未有矣。是夕與宴諸文藝家。均齊集於三樓。佈置極雅靜。王濟遠洋畫家。謂此樓應有題名。方不愧此裝製。主人擬命名春醪室。請譚延闓氏作書云。散席已午夜。濡筆記此以留鴻爪。</p>
<h3>記生面别開之廉潔運動會</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>此次上海四川路靑年會。爲促醒一般人沉淪於煙酒賭博起見。舉行廉潔運動大會。期凡三日。自十三日起。至十五日止。開幕之日特往參觀。事爲創舉。因記所見如下。</p>
<p>會場設於靑年會會客室。由扶梯直上。兩旁標語揰畫。觸目皆是。且標語之上。所書語句。皆屬新穎。如「人無遠慮必有近憂。」「積少成多。」聚沙成塔。」「能儉約者不求人。」等。揰畫如女子深入慾海。老人不知節儉。孤兒無人撫養等。均足令人生警惕之心。塲中由各銀行及各慈善機關。滿置展覽物品。銀行之參加者。計有上海商業儲蓄銀行。鹽城。中南。大陸。金城四行儲蓄部等。其中尤以上海銀行。紥一六角彩亭。滿懸紅綠紙綵。最足令人注目。此外如通易信公司銀行儲蓄部。友邦人壽保險公司等。均有出品展覽。要皆勸人勿賭勿嫖。歸於儉約之道也。參觀之人。各銀行均有章程目錄。依次分發。故比及外出。皆人手一束紅綠小册矣。且除展覽以外。尙有名人演講。游藝大會。開映電影。是故連日參觀者。絡繹不絶他如靑年協會書局。亦以各種善書。陳列會塲。廉價出售。而扶梯之上。懸有匾額一方。上書「思無邪」三字。其用意更覺深刻也。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>到郵局去寄包裹或是掛號信。切不可在星期一去寄。因爲星期一是郵局最忙的日子。</p>
<p>到火車站過磅行李。如果分量重了。例須加費。這時只要向同去的人没有帶行李的。借一張車票。那麽就可以然過磅了。</p>
<p>兑角子切不可到火車站和輪船局相近的烟紙店去兑。因爲這種烟紙告大都拿鉿角子來欺騙急於動身的主顧。</p>
<p>上小飯店。樓上和樓下大有分别。樓下比樓上要便宜得多。一樣的菜飯。樓下格外來得豐滿。因爲飯店定例是優待經濟朋友的。</p>
<h3>心上温馨　（一二九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回瓊筵開處嬌鳥啼花金屋妝成良禽擇木</p>
<p>有一天。嚴一塵叫了一位姑娘。却坐在鄭彦修的對面。老遠的給他講話。嚴　一塵笑道。這樣的講話。太費力了。還是轉一個條子過去吧。連忙取了一張局票。寫了交與那位姑娘。這姑娘巴不得鄭七少叫伊。便把局票摺了四疊。放在粉鏡後揰粉紙的地方。在嚴一塵那裏。再坐了五分鐘。便轉到鄭彦修那邊來。彦修也並不拒絶。他覺得人家叫堂唱。和自己叫堂唱。没有什麽分别。爲了講話便利起見。坐得近些。也没什麽不可。彦修起初是不叫堂唱。自從破戒以後。人家看見好的姑娘。都介紹給他。他也來者不拒。因爲那些姑娘。都不是他愜心貴當的人。所謂「匪我思存」者。可是他們旣然歡迎到他。他也一個個與他們周旋一下。却是有一種不好之處。凡是彦修所叫來的堂唱。都是黏在那裏。老不想去。任憑你轉堂唱的相帮。在門外喊着五小姐六小姐。姓張姓王。後添後添。伊總是坐得穏穏的。不肯起身。甚而至於别人處只坐五分鐘的。到了鄭彦修那裏坐了半點鐘一點鐘。有時叫了兩位姑娘來。大家也不肯先走。坐在那兒鬥勁。誰先走了。算是誰先失敗。暗暗地在那裏拈酸。以爲鄭七和那個好了。便和那個疏遠。其實都没有關係。彦修却心中暗暗地好笑。有時他見兩個堂唱。都坐着相併。他想這班人何拙笨乃爾。他站起來説我還有一個應酬。我先走了。他們見他站起來。也只好走了。因爲彦修對於那班姑娘。一個都不在心上。可是鄭彦修究竟還是墮入了綺障。以佛家言之。凡是都逃不了一個緣字。原來上海地方的倡門。有許多階級。最高者爲書庽。其次爲么二。其次爲野雞。從前還没有所謂鹹肉莊的一種名目。那種專供肉慾的所在。稱之爲　基。那是一種不堪的地方。其次除了最下級的花烟間。那種脂粉地獄以外。一切都歸人野雞類。這是上海的一種土語。凡是不軌於正的。都稱之爲野雞。譬如不是正班開行的船。稱之爲野雞輪船。一種站路搭客的馬車或包車。便稱之爲野雞馬車或野雞包車。因此非正式的娼妓。也稱之爲野雞妓院。其實即此野雞妓院之中。也有種種等級。低級的自然是四馬路靑遵閣拉客的謂之野雞。而高級的却有勝於一般最高的書庽。</p>

<h3>荷蘭女詩人宜獨芙夫人</h3>
<p>— 陳學昭</p>
<p>社會如廣大無限的大海濁流、生命乃不過繼續而逐此濁流而轉動、踓欲與之奮勇戰搏、然百數年裏、很少有能克勝的、</p>
<p>荷蘭現代女詩人宜獨芙夫人（ＮｅｌｌＤｏｆｆ）是一位破現代社會的濁流的一朶浪花、吟現實苦的詩人、</p>
<p>夫人是荷蘭人、生於一八五八年一月二十七日、父親是一個警察、母親是一個織花邊的女工人、夫人共有兄弟姊妹九人、她是第三、因爲在這種家庭情况之下、夫人極糼時、就負照料小弟妹的事務、不能按時入校讀書、其後、她的父親葉警察職、於是他們全家就不能不另找生活的路、一雙貧窮的父母帶了九個孩就到Ａｍｓｔｅｒｄａｍ地方去、結果、她的父親做了車夫、但所收入全然不夠他們九個孩子的食住、所以她們只好住在地窖裏、（歐洲房屋最底一層下之地窖、普通永不住人、只存放酒及行李等物、）這時生活的苦、簡直不堪言狀、當大水時、全地窖被大水所浸没了、孩子們半夜醒來的時候、她們大半個身子已經没在水裏了、　　然而在夫人的精神上、她還不自感到她是貧苦的、她對於貧苦的見解、</p>
<p>「不能照着自已的心理去研究其不知之事物、譬如讀書、因被種種阻礙所克服、而不能實行、不能使其親近美、此爲眞眞的貧苦、」</p>
<p>又謂、　　「我不是理想主義者、也不是以敎育爲目的的敎士一類、我的意思以爲我的作品、均是從一切困苦中所産生的、困苦使我磨難到足足有二十年之久、自這困苦的二十年後之生活、是被摧殘了的生活、所以對於世上一切苦難、均能很鋭敏的感到、如看見四週的人、有種種阻礙防其發育、如一孩子本可靜心求學、但因被生活問題所逼、只好去謀生活、不能好好造成其才能、這、對於我所感者、實在有無限的深痛、</p>
<p>蓋夫人自身、就抱有此種深痛的人、她在糼時、只有一種普通的家庭裏的敎育、而没有受到學校裏的敎育、直到二十歲、她還只知道法文中的一個「Ｎｏｎ」「否」字、及二十八歲、她的唯一伴侶丈夫、使她進比京音樂院（Ｃｏｎｓｅｒｖａｔｏｉｒｅ　ｄｅ　Ｂｒｕｇ２</p>
<p>ｘｅｌｌｅｓ）、「Ｖｉｓｉｏｎ」讀書法、才開始窺古典文學的大略、</p>
<p>夫人自謂她對於讀書之愛好、出於天性、「年糼時、我常通夜看書、我對於讀書的熱情、比愛還大、」</p>
<p>至於對於其從事於著作的曆史、最好還是注意她的忠實的自白、</p>
<p>「回憶糼時所作小説、我並不敢公布於任何人、我會以我作小説事告Ｇｅｏｒｇｅ　Ｅｃｋｈｏｕｄ一人、當我不曾完全説出時、他就阻止我不必説、於是把小説放在抽屉裏、幾年以後、終於把牠燒掉了、」</p>
<p>但我的一種自我表現和慾望、就是寫作、時時像一種思鄉病似的在我的精神上、没有離去、</p>
<p>一個冬天、我住在Ａｎｖｅｒｓ、偶然在窗口、看見街上有羣孩在玩鬧、這時、我手中正拿了書在讀我的Ｖｉｓｉｃｎ課、忽然其中的一個孩子、樣子非常狼狽、被人大打了一頓、這情景立刻引起我兒時的種種回憶、因爲我的弟弟們糼時也正被人家常這樣打着的、因爲是貧苦人家的孩子、於是此時我就放下書、拿起紙筆開始寫、居</p>
<p>然手不停地直到寫成、直到一本記事册都寫完了、寫完後、心頭感到的輕鬆、好像把自身孩提時所受之苦難、復了仇似的、不過這種感情一時後就消失了、繼續着、便爲一種苦痛及無可名狀的悲哀所襲擊、我尙能記得這是在一九○九年的二月二十八日的事、那時我住的街名Ａｖｅｎｕｅｄｕ　Ｓｕｄ、</p>
<p>數日後、適遇一女友來訪、我就拿這稿問她的意見、她看後説頗好、但照她看、没有多大的價値、接着又説、明日Ｌａｕｒｅｎｔ　ｔａｉｌｂａｄｅ正在她家、可以拿了稿去問他的意見、次日、我就去了、開始就念我的稿子、Ｔａｉｌｂａｄｅ非常注意、但我終被一種胆小及羞慚的心緒所迫、常常停止、每當我停止時、Ｔａｉｌｂａｄｅ催續念下去、於是全稿續完、Ｔａｉｌｂａｄｅ持我手而以極感動的話説、「非常佩服、但須注意、不須更改、一個字也不要更改、那天、我很快樂的還到家裏、把篙放在抽屉裏、也没有對我的丈夫説起、數月之後、Ｔａｉｌｂａｄｅ有信片來問及這小説、我的丈夫才問我這事的究竟　於是我解説了、他説可交Ｖｅｒｂａｅｒｅｕ問其意見、Ｖ氏讀後加數語於上日、「這是詩的、」又説「須重新做一下、把點生命進去、」直到數年後我始完全明白、Ｖ氏此數語的意義、他所説的是辭藻上的修飾及換用一些響亮的字進去、二年以後、得ＭａｄａｍｅＯｃｔａｖｅ　Ｍａｕｓ　、在比京的、把我手抄本稿子交給Ｌｕｇｄｅ　Ｐｏｅ　Ｌ、氏、把我這稿交巴黎Ｆａｓｑｕｅｌｌｅ書舗、此書舗爲第一出版我的書的地方、一</p>
<p>宜獨芙夫人所著、曾有七部小説、彼之著作形式雖然爲小説的、然其思想却是詩的、故人稱爲詩人、</p>
<p>其七部小説是、Ｙｏｕｒｓ　ｄｅ　Ｆａｍｉｎｅｅｔ　ｄｅ　ｄｅｔｒｅｓｓｅ、Ｃｏｎｌｅｓ　Ｆａｒｏｕｂｅｓ、Ｋｎｅｔｊｅ、Ｋｅｅｔｊｅ　ｔｒａｔｔｉｎ、Ａｎｇｅ·Ｌｕｎｅｌｌｅ、Ｃａｍｐｉｎｅ與Ｅｌｖｃ、七種、</p>
<p>其中有一部名Ｃｏｎｔｅｓ　Ｆａｒｏｕｃｈｅｓ、出版於一九一三年、不過這書不地夫人所最愛好的小説集、她所最喜的是她的第一部作品Ｋｃｅｔｉｅ　ｔｒｏｔｔｉｎ、其次便爲最出版的Ｅｌｖｅ及Ｙｏｕｒｓ　ｄｅ　ｆａｍｉｎｅ　ｅｔ　ｄｅＤｅｔｅｓｓｅ、彼自云此兩部書中所描寫的没有一樣是過甚其辭或誇張的、夫人以爲文人的想像、並非是完全發明的、乃在他們自身所感受的最深刻的回憶中而造成其他們對於現實世界所給於他們的情感、這種情感、就是對於不幸者的憐憫、</p>
<p>夫人所愛的書是爲聖西蒙（Ｓａｉｎｉｔ·Ｓｉｍｏｎ）的十一本「回憶錄」（Ｍｌｅｍｏｉｒｅｓ）、這書竟曾讀了有四次的多、聖脱不佛（Ｓａｉｎｔｅ·Ｂｅｎｖｅ）「的星期一」（Ｌｕｎｄｉ）她也愛讀、又喜讀巴爾札克（Ｓａｌｙａｃ）的書、巴氏對於她簡直看待爲上帝、德國海湼（Ｈｅｉｎｅ）爲她所愛的詩人、三年前、她才發現了歌德、（Ｇｏｅｔｂｅ）、她立刻變成了歌德的熱愛者、她開始讀了Ｔ·Ｍ·Ｃａｒｒｅ的「歌德傅」、又讀了Ｌｕｄｗｉｇ的「歌德傅」法國百科全書的始創人Ｄｉｄｅｒｏｔ的書、她也讀得頗多、盧梭（Ｊ·Ｊ·Ｒｏｕｓｓｅａｖ）的懺悔錄、她很愛讀、</p>
<p>法國現代批評家Ｓｔｅｉａｎ　Ｚｗｅｉｇ氏在「羅曼羅蘭序傳、」中、曾把夫人列之於世界上最著名的作家、如高爾基（Ｇ曾ｏｒｋｉ）</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>及　拿夜脱裏基（Ｐａｎａｉｌ　Ｔｓｔｒａｔｉ）同等</p>
<p>今夫人白髮絲絲、將與其著作之價値、漸漸的增多着、我們聽到中國好些唱血與涙之文學、而對於宜獨芙夫人自身經歷即爲一血涙之眞結晶、不禁起許多感想、一九三○年一月五日、巴黎</p>

<p>一月二十日紐約訊、服務於標準局聲學試騐所之物理學家包爾赫爾博士（Ｄｒ·Ｐａｕｌ　Ｒ·Ｈｅｙｌ）在此間演説云科學進步漸能解决生命之謎、不久、生命將可以在實騐室裏製造、</p>
<p>這位物理學家宣布一九二九這個年頭、對於「生命底秘密」的發見、比之别的年頭、更顯出長足的進步、赫爾博士説、</p>
<p>「生命的本源只是物理的和化學的作用、我們將要把其中的奥秘探討出來、我們將要知道生命的製造法、和現在知道煤炭燃燒作用一樣地明曉、並且要知道如何來製造、建造生命底基礎——原形質、</p>
<p>就已往的兩百年來科學上的成就看來、我不相信有所謂不可能的事情、我以爲現時的科學已逹到解决生命之謎的可能程度、我們已經能夠用人工製造很多在體中作用的化合物了、</p>
<p>生命是没有什麽隠秘和神奇的、我們也許能解决其中的秘密、所謂原形質也不是什麽只是化學上的化合品罷了、我覺得無理由、我們不能把他製造起來、把他的生與死都製造起來、——没有人敢這樣説的、」</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Hu, Tan, and Wang Joint Telegram to Yan</h3>
<p>The State Has Principles, the Party Has Discipline, Individuals Have Absolutely No Freedom to Advance or Retreat</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, and Wang Chonghui telegraphed Yan Xishan in Taiyuan on the 15th, "To Deputy Commander Yan Baichuan: After carefully reading Governor Jiang's telegram, we are deeply moved. Governor Jiang received his mandate from the Party, shouldering this heavy responsibility. He repeatedly requested to relinquish his post, but was not approved. Because of the many troubles within the country, he exhausted himself without complaint. The state has principles, the party has discipline, and individuals have absolutely no freedom to advance or retreat. Sir, without the Party and State's permission, you intend to coerce Governor Jiang to leave with you. Your stubbornness is, in our humble opinion, not acceptable. You have repeatedly received important commissions from the Central Government and sworn an oath upon taking office, with the ink barely dry. You should carefully consider your actions and words when advancing or retreating. You should uphold the Party and State's principles and set an example for your subordinates. If your subordinates were to act without your consultation, as you have done with the Central Government, or threaten you as you threaten Governor Jiang, would you not be greatly angered? This is the first matter we implore you to reconsider. If you say that suppressing disorder is not as good as stopping it, that is indeed a famous saying. However, stopping disorder is not as good as not having it at all. The Central Government, having no other choice, has launched punitive expeditions in recent years. Internal rebellions are gradually being quelled, and we are about to work hard on reconstruction and begin political tutelage. Yet you alone see the hidden dangers. This is neither the worry of a杞人 (a man from the state of Qi who was afraid that the sky would fall), nor the moaning of someone without illness. If you are confused and unable to explain, it will only cause those who are tired of disorder to be suspicious and those who like disorder to rejoice. If this is called stopping disorder, how is it different from creating it? This is the second matter we implore you to reconsider. Even if suppressing is not as good as stopping, from the Gui clique to Tang Shengzhi, the Central Government initially intended to stop the disorder with kindness and tolerance. When it could no longer be stopped, it had to be suppressed. If you insist on protecting those who create disorder and blame the Central Government for suppressing it, how can you explain your own past actions, such as leading troops at Fenglingdu and ordering deployments at Zhengzhou? This is the third matter we implore you to reconsider. We have served the Party and the country for many years. We may be less intelligent than others, but we cannot remain silent on matters of principle. Considering the overall situation, we have spoken at length. We earnestly hope you will remember the norms set by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the hard work of the martyrs. For the sake of the Party and the country, please consider carefully. We respectfully offer our humble opinions and await your clear instructions. Your brothers, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, and Wang Chonghui, bow and request deletion." (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zheng Luosheng telegraphed from Singapore to the Central Party Headquarters, relayed to Yan: "To Mr. Yan Baichuan: Rumors say that you telegraphed Comrade Jiang Zhongzheng, expressing your intention to resign together. Now is a time of lurking chaos. Comrade Jiang bears the late Premier's mission and takes full responsibility for the Party and the country. It is not the time to resign. As you hold the position of Deputy Commander, your every move has a great impact on the future of the Party and the country. Moreover, before the seeds of disorder have been extinguished, to suddenly utter such alarming words, whether intentional or unintentional, is enough to confuse people. Unless you are being instigated by treacherous individuals, you must have actions that are disloyal to Comrade Jiang. Overseas Chinese consider your expressions to be a grave mistake. We humbly hope that you will issue a statement to remedy the situation." (15th)</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Telegram to Zhao</h3>
<p>Reading Yan Baigong's Recent Telegrams</p>
<p>There are Three Things That Seem Impossible</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Zhihui's telegram deleted, To Zhao Daiwen in Taiyuan, "Sir Cilong, I have respectfully received and read your repeated instructions from recent days. Your kind words and broad benefits are greatly admired. I have also heard that your telegram to Governor Jiang suggests a possibility of reconciliation, which is particularly joyful. Reading Baigong's recently issued telegrams, there are three things that seem impossible: (1) Now that military affairs have just been settled, the Central Government has completely ceased to inquire about the whereabouts of major rebels like Baigong, who led the punitive expedition. The Central Government has already inquired about the whereabouts of the major rebels who led the punitive expedition. And those rebellious soldiers who were momentarily lost and confused are granted amnesty if they repent. All this is to strive for peace and alleviate the people's suffering. But just as the five Yuan Chief's declaration of peace and unification was announced, Baigong's blame for unification by force arrived. I don't know what this so-called force refers to. People in Zheng are alarmed by Boyou, and gather on the streets to whisper, all saying that Yan Baichuan has another problem. All of this is caused by Baigong's thunderbolt from a clear sky. Generally, before warfare begins, there must be righteous words. Who doesn't have a reason for being correct and reasonable? It's just that some are clumsy at criticizing and scolding, and denounce people for resigning, while others are skillful at cold sarcasm and invite people to resign. That is the difference. Everyone believes that the telegram is a prelude to Chen Shi's succession. Therefore, the country is again in a state of anxiety. Baigong must say, 'What is my intention? I am not one of those ignorant people. Who can understand me?' This is the peace that we in the north have been racking our brains to achieve, which Baigong has ruined with one telegram. Therefore, Baigong will unexpectedly be blamed for the chaos that follows. This is the first impossibility. (2) If his proposals are implemented, it would truly create chaos. Like ancient jokes, if men and women are given sexual organs, they will inevitably engage in sexual acts. Now, the Central Government still has military preparations, so it is hard to avoid force. Foreseeing the danger and preventing it, resigning for no reason, or even committing suicide to avoid suspicion, is something that can only be said of ideal figures who entrust the Party and the country to others. Baigong says that the various disputes are due to the three major disagreements and that the solution is to unite the three sessions of executive supervisors. I will say that Baigong's ambition is great, but Baigong's title is not appropriate. The reason why the three sessions have disagreements is that some were appointed during the election. Those who were appointed followed the precedent set by the first session's Premier and continued in the second session. If there are still disagreements about this, Baigong suddenly wants to entrust the entire Party and the country to the three sessions of executive supervisors. According to what precedent did Chiang follow, and according to what Party constitution? The three sessions followed the old precedent and engaged in relief, yet that is evidence of a crime. Baigong relies solely on qualifications and appoints the entire group, isn't that becoming a demon king? Those executive supervisors personally appointed by the Premier, such as Mr. Wang Jingwei, are suddenly accused of crimes, and those executive supervisors carefully selected by the second session, such as Mr. Zou Haibin, are also criticized for violating the law. The painful history of the executive supervisors can be said in one word by Baigong. Before the three sessions were held, the so-called executive supervisors gathered in Tangshan one day. Someone said that the Premier appointed them to prevent corruption. The second session appointed them to be pro-communist. Now that we are anti-communist, we should prevent covert communists from mixing in. Therefore, if the election is too perfect, the Party will be fragmented. If we want the Party to be complete, the election can be followed by precedent. Mr. Li Delin, a supervisor, was the first to support it, but the dissidents were led by Mr. Li. Then, the so-called three sessions of executive supervisors have already made right and wrong based on personal likes and dislikes. Baigong does not propose entrusting the entire Party and the country to all Party members, but favors the executive supervisors who each hold their own opinions on right and wrong. He does not entrust it to the executive supervisors legally elected by all Party members, but thinks of the old family, the tall trees, the almost feudal qualifications of the executive supervisors. This is already bizarre and absurd. Those who resembled Baigong's proposal have already been tested by the Special Committee. Wang and Zhang cursed it as illegal, and there was a full-scale martial arts fight, which triggered the great massacre in Guangzhou. After the pain, Baigong, are you willing to test it again? This is the second impossibility. (3) I will take another step and offer a suggestion. Even if the three sessions of executive supervisors can be entrusted, according to Baigong's ambition, let's define force. Baigong now wants to impeach himself and resign. Whether it's far away or recently, it's probably because he believed in Huan Gong's defeat of Meng Xiao, which is close to believing in force, so he deeply repents. Therefore, he invites Governor Jiang to resign, also because he has repeatedly pacified rebellions, causing endless expenses, which seems to rely on force, so he repents together. However, as the saying goes, 'Striking and retaliating are both guilty,' and the severity should be judged. Looking at the history of past chaos, the so-called Gui clique, I initially believed that they would not rebel. Even before the Central Government moved its defenses, Hu and Tao had already issued a telegram attacking them head-on. I still forgave their ignorance. When Jian Sheng and Ji Kuan attacked Guangzhou and almost captured the stronghold, I was speechless. Wang and Zhang personally labeled the Gui clique as warlords, making it difficult for them to refute the public opinion, so Wu Zhihui also had the pain of being compared to bandits. Now, Huang and Li have joined forces with Wang and Zhang again. Let's not talk about this transformation. In short, Wang, Zhang, Huang, and Li, all the way to Sun, Liu, Song, and Tang, all belong to the initiators of action, while the Central Government belongs to the retaliators. This is obvious to all. We also do not discuss the right and wrong or judge the severity of the guilt. Baigong and Governor Jiang, who retaliated, have been determined to be fond of using force and must resign. Then, Wang, Zhang, Huang, and Li, who started the action, and those who telegraphed in support of the military, such as your close friend Baigong and our close friend the Gui clique, and those who appointed Hua Nanjing, if they are all accused of using force, there will be no injustice. All should leave the country and there is no need to discuss it. Therefore, Baigong bought tickets to go abroad for the second time. In the past, he only went with Huan Gong, but now he will only go with Governor Jiang. He has not yet booked a large number of cabins in advance, which is a mistake. If a large number of people go abroad and leave, how many of the three sessions of executive supervisors will be left to form a meeting? They will surely invite Pu Yi, Cao Kun, Duan Qirui, and Wu Peifu to make up the numbers and entrust state affairs to the elders. I dare not be too humorous, because after carefully studying the content of Baigong's proposal, it is indeed this humorous, and not as outwardly grand as it seems. Therefore, I dare not avoid the suspicion of great disrespect and believe that these three are impossible. In short, these are all disputes over words that are too meticulous. I should know my sin. If we talk about facts, I can weep and say that no one dares to believe in force, disregard the people's suffering, or use troops for no reason. Now, we are urgently seeking lasting peace, improving the political situation, and letting the people rest. As for the Central Government, it is not the Central Government of one person. To maintain unity and cope with foreign troubles, we must have appropriate military preparations. In the localities, it is not the day when ministers should be punished and the Heavenly King is wise, but to maintain law and order, there must be appropriate defense. All of this is the way of heaven and the righteousness of the earth, and we should understand each other and not give rise to suspicion because of this. This must be clearly explained. Today's matter, I believe that you will arrive soon, see the recent truth, and immediately quell the disturbances. I have asked Mr. Pan to speak to you in detail. I know that you are beneficial to the country, and you will not avoid hard work or danger. We are willing to give up our old lives, and history will have its own judgment. The feelings of sorrow and hope cannot be fully expressed. Your brother, Wu Jingheng, bows and requests deletion."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Observing the Naval Conference from the Perspective of International Trade</h3>
<p>The relationship of this Five Great Powers Naval Conference. From the perspective of overall international trade competition. It can be divided into the Pacific and Atlantic for observation. In the Pacific. The relationship between Britain, the United States and Japan is more important. The focus is on the Chinese market. Recently, it has been reported that the competition between Britain, the United States and Japan on the issue of cruisers is very intense. The so-called British-American alliance to contain Japan in foreign telegrams is from the perspective of the Pacific. In the Atlantic. The relationship between Britain, the United States and France is closer. France has risen since its victory over Germany. Industry is booming. In the European continent market. It has long become a strong rival of Britain. Therefore, on the issue of German compensation. There was a fierce protest. During the British Conservative Party cabinet era. He strongly advocated uniting France against the United States. The Geneva Conference. It broke down due to disputes over sea power. Britain and France formed a naval agreement. At the same time, the United States also expressed its intention to expand its cruiser plan. Thus the Atlantic storm. Suddenly saw a dangerous turn. However, after the Labour Party formed its second cabinet last year. Foreign policy. It reversed the previous cabinet's position. And strongly advocated uniting the United States. France is also not as close as the previous cabinet. We observe the French representative in the ongoing car conference. Forcefully objected to the British and American submarine cruiser proposals. The firmness of his attitude. Almost the same as the Japanese representative. The clue can be seen. As for Britain and Italy. Diplomatic relations were very close. At this naval conference, the Italian representative strongly advocated that it should have the same naval power as France. There is also a purpose for this.</p>
<p>Therefore, observing from the Pacific and Atlantic, one can get a glimpse of the situation of this naval conference. Today's Japanese telegram said that the four plenipotentiaries of Britain, the United States, Japan and France. Issued memos or statements. To promote the progress of the meeting. In fact, the distance is still far. Because the opinions of the four countries. There is too much separation. In recent days, there has been contact with the central point. Whether the meeting is successful or not. It all depends on how sincere the countries are in making concessions in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Railway Ministry Advisor Inspects Jinpu Railway Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Railway Ministry's American advisor Mentel reported on the inspection of the Puxin Railway affairs. (1) The railway has been affected by the war. The original freight cars totaled 1988, but only 466 remain. Since 1924, the north and south have had wars. About one year apart, the railway was divided into two sections, with the northern section ending in Yanzhou and the southern section starting in Lincheng. The northern section's headquarters was in Tianjin, and the southern section's headquarters was in Pukou. The accounting system is extremely chaotic. The sleepers in the section from Pukou to Lincheng are particularly damaged. On average, 36% of the sleepers need to be replaced in the section from Pukou to Lincheng, 28% to 32% in the section from Lincheng to Jinan, and 25% to 28% in the section from Jinan to Tianjin. (2) The Jinpu Railway crosses the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Zhili. The agricultural and mineral products are very abundant. In the future, when joint transportation is restored, the business will surely prosper. If a pontoon bridge can be installed in Jingpu, the annual income can be increased to 30 million yuan in four or five years. (3) Shanghai imports 1 million tons of Japanese coal every year, which is a pity to waste. The Zhongxing Coal Mine Company is 272 English miles away from Pukou and 468 English miles away from Shanghai. It currently produces only 3,000 tons of coal per day. If transportation is convenient, the daily output can be increased by 2,000 tons, and the annual output can be 1.1 million tons, so there is no need for foreign coal. (4) The western part of the Jiaoji Railway and the areas passed by the Longhai Railway are full of agricultural products. In order to develop the railway's freight and the local area at the same time, the full car freight rate should also be set at the lowest possible limit. (5) The problem of redundant personnel is the same on this railway as on other railways. If the railway affairs can be reorganized, at least 30% can be reduced. In the future, each railway bureau should have four directors of general affairs, engineering affairs, business affairs, and accounting, and the railway should be divided into three sections: Pukou to Xuzhou as the first section, Xuzhou to Jinan as the second section, and Jinan to Tianjin as the third section. According to Mentel's idea, the railway project is extremely large, and the total cost of the railway is US$36,938,520, which is about US$59,000 per mile. If it is today, it will not be done without US$95,000 or US$105,000. (15th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>International Telegrams</h3>
<p>British, French, and American Naval Experts Discuss Tonnage Issues</p>
<p>Based on the French Memorandum</p>
<p>Japan Has No Intention of Abandoning the 70% Requirement</p>
<p>The Naval Conference May Be Postponed to Mid-March</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 14th. Naval experts from Britain, France, and the United States met this morning for two hours to discuss tonnage, based on the French memorandum. The date of the plenary meeting has not yet been discussed. The tonnage quotas for Britain, France, the United States, and Japan must first be determined. A well-informed source said that the status of the Naval Conference is almost like a charade. Some people estimate that the Five-Power Naval Conference will be delayed until mid-March. French Prime Minister Tardieu and Foreign Minister Briand have already started their journey back to Paris this morning. Tardieu told a Reuters reporter that discussions on the important issue of tonnage have just begun, so why be so anxious?</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 15th. British newspapers speculated that Japan could abandon this request because the Japanese answer did not mention the 70% ratio. In fact, Japan has no such intention. Moreover, the proposal contained in the Japanese memorandum on the 13th of this month clearly stipulates that various auxiliary ships and large cruisers should be compiled according to the ratio of 10:10:7 between the United States, Britain, and Japan. According to reliable sources, the tonnage of the two methods proposed by Japan, A and B, are slightly different from those previously reported. The actual figures are listed below. (A) "Large Cruisers": US 180,000 tons, Japan 126,000 tons, "Small Cruisers": US 147,000 tons, Japan 81,700 tons, "Destroyers": US 150,000 tons, Japan 105,000 tons, "Submarines": US 81,000 tons, Japan 77,900 tons. (B) "Large Cruisers": US 150,000 tons, Japan 108,400 tons, "Small Cruisers": US 189,000 tons, Japan 107,700 tons, "Destroyers and Submarines": Same as A. If the United States is only willing to have 60,000 tons of submarines according to its proposal on February 5, then the United States can transfer the remaining 21,000 tons to the destroyer category, forming 171,000 tons. However, Japan must maintain 77,900 tons of submarines.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th. Some members of the Japanese Navy, regarding the future of the London Conference, hold a pessimistic view because the claims of various countries are too far apart, making it difficult to reach a compromise. Under the current circumstances, if Britain and the United States recognize France's request for a total tonnage of 420,000 tons, then there is no reason to reject Japan's request. Therefore, Britain and the United States must first restrain France's request as a prerequisite. The reason why they are doing their best in negotiations with France is for this reason. However, it is doubtful whether France, which insists on proceeding according to its established policy and refuses to change, will be happy to comply. Depending on how the situation develops in the future, the future is not optimistic. Therefore, Japan also feels very difficult to approach Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Korean Governor-General Announces Policy for Governing Korea</h3>
<p>Relying on Chinese Studies to Prevent New Ideas</p>
<p>Limiting Korean Youth's Opportunities to Study</p>
<p>Korean Students' Opposition Becomes More Intense</p>
<p>▲Special Dispatch from Seoul, Korea. The anti-Japanese riots by Korean students this time were beyond the Japanese expectation. The newly appointed Governor-General of Korea, Saito Minoru, convened more than 30 representatives of Japanese expatriates on the 5th of this month to discuss governance policies and solicit opinions from Japanese expatriates. He then convened the heads of the Governor-General's Office to secretly discuss various issues, and announced the new policies on the 9th. The main points are as follows: (1) Encourage Korea's inherent Chinese studies and promote Confucianism to prevent the infiltration of new ideas. (2) School education should be thoroughly reformed, and emphasis should be placed on industry. (3) Entrance to public schools should be restricted. Those who bear an annual tax of more than 200 yuan are eligible to enter school. (4) The implementation of local autonomy should start from urban areas. Local autonomous groups should be jointly organized by Japanese and Koreans. Those who have the right to elect and be elected in autonomous groups should be limited to those with property of more than 3,000 yuan. (5) Formulate a law to ban private schools and prohibit their indiscriminate establishment. (6) Formulate police regulations to ban Koreans in Manchuria and foreign countries, prevent their activities and propaganda. After the announcement of the above policies, Korean circles were greatly indignant. Student demonstrations in various places became more intense. In urban areas, most public schools have been declared abolished, and private schools in rural areas have followed the example of students in cities. No school in the country is still open.</p>

<h3>The Achievements of the League of Nations in 1929 Are as Follows</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Geneva, 15th. The year 1929 was one of the most successful years for the League of Nations in handling peace affairs. The Secretariat registered a total of 24 new treaties, compared to only 15 in 1928 and only 6 in 1927. The United States signed 20 treaties last year.</p>
<h3>Political Situation in Spain in Disarray</h3>
<p>The King Attacked by the Socialist Party</p>
<p>Difficult to Get on the Path of Constitutionalism for a While</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Madrid, 14th. Industrial disputes in Spain arise from time to time, and the King is attacked by people, making it more difficult for General Berenguer to guide the country onto the constitutional track. The Socialist Party is currently the only organized political party. This is the only correct fact in a very chaotic political situation. The Socialist Party is now shifting its attacks on General Rivera to the King. The people are quite agitated by the fact that the former dictator abused his authority, took improper measures, and wasted public funds. Old political parties are now planning to reorganize, but it is difficult to proceed due to the lack of leaders. Currently, the political stage is occupied by the leader of the Liberal Party, Unamuno, and the leader of the Republican Party, Lebeiro. They are now severely attacking the King. The government is now instructing the Kyoto municipal government to rush to carry out public works to absorb unemployed people in order to prevent the recurrence of disturbances. Last night, the Barcelona police dispersed a riot that threw stones and smashed the headquarters of the Patriotic Association.</p>
<h3>Fierce Competition in the Japanese General Election</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, the Number of Criminals is Also Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior Issues a Strict Warning</p>
<p>▲Nichi-Ren, Tokyo, 15th. As the election date approaches, the competition is becoming increasingly heated. At the same time, the number of people using illegal means is gradually increasing. On the 14th, the Ministry of the Interior issued the following announcement to the local governors in the name of the Director of the Police Security Bureau: As the election date is approaching, the movement is gradually becoming more intense. At the same time, the number of various criminals is increasing. Strict vigilance should be exercised against those who buy votes and use bribery to entice others. Efforts should be made to prevent such crimes, and it is hoped that they will be cracked down on and reported.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th. Although interference and oppression in elections are strictly prohibited on the surface, they are carried out by clever means in various places. There are many cases where people are ordered to pay attention or stop during speeches. For example, in mining areas, the company sends people to guard the entrance of the venue to prevent miners from entering the speech hall. Officials turn a blind eye to this. In addition, athletes are often detained for very weak reasons, and their distribution of leaflets is interfered with. The Proletarian Party listed many of the above facts and protested to the Ministry of the Interior.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 15th. Foreign Minister Shidehara will go to Osaka from Tokyo tonight to give a speech to support the Minseito candidate. He will return to Tokyo the day after tomorrow. Other cabinet members and parliamentary vice-ministers from the party are generally fighting on all fronts, and send telegrams of encouragement to all parties to consolidate the battle lines. It is said that the Minseito is fighting hard to win 250 seats.</p>
<h3>The Japan Post Dispute Has Not Been Resolved</h3>

<h3>Extension and Construction of the Southern Section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong-Hankou Railway is a trunk line connecting the north and south of the country, and the authorities are paying close attention to its completion in order to connect with the Pinghan Railway. The Ministry of Railways strived to obtain the Boxer Indemnity to be used for construction. It has recently been reported that negotiations have been successful to receive two-thirds of the returned amount for the project. The Ministry of Railways recently sent a committee chairman to Guangdong to discuss the project with the local authorities, and has received support. At the same time, the Ministry of Railways raised 2.5 million yuan for construction materials, which has already been remitted to Guangdong, and the Ministry will allocate 500,000 yuan per month, and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau will allocate 200,000 yuan from its monthly surplus as construction funds. The construction of the section from Shaoguan to Lechang will begin first. It has recently been reported that the director of the Engineering Bureau, Zhuo Kangcheng, has completed the route survey. The section from Shaozhou to Lechang is 80 miles long and is expected to be completed in one year. The section from Lechang to Zhuzhou is 240 miles long. This section of the route passes through many valleys, and the project will be relatively large and will take four years to complete. It is rumored that the authorities are actively proceeding, and the Shaoguan-Lechang section can start construction at the end of this month. (February 10)</p>

<h3>Alarming Ice Jam on the Yongding River</h3>
<p>▲ Hebei Provincial Government is Preparing to Build a Dam</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, 11th: Due to the lack of allocated funds, the breach in the Yongding River has not been closed yet. However, this matter is related to the safety of the lives of the people along the river, so the provincial government is actively proceeding. At yesterday's memorial week, Wen Shouquan, the Director of the Department of Construction, reported that the Three Provinces Yellow River Management Conference is scheduled to be held in Kaifeng on February 20th. This province has decided to send the newly appointed Director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, Zhu Yanping, to attend. In addition, the ice jam on the Yongding River is approaching, and construction of the dam is urgently needed. A telegram was sent to the central government urging instructions on how to use the surtax of the Tianjin Customs first, and the Department of Finance has submitted a telegram to the provincial government urging the River and Sea Management Commission to issue public bonds as soon as possible, so that the commission can allocate 460,000 yuan from the remaining funds of the Hai River to assist the construction funds, so that they can find a way to borrow it as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs, so that the people along the river will not suffer another disaster. The issue of closing the Yongding River breach is imminent. Earlier, an organizational regulation for the Yongding River Breach Closure Project Office was issued by the provincial government, and the Department forwarded the national budget for the Yongding River Breach Closure Project to the Construction Committee for review. It is now drafting the construction specifications and detailed rules for the Project Office, and looking for a location, in order to establish the Project Office organization in the near future. More than one hundred cases have been discussed and decided before and after the river affairs meeting, and have now been compiled into a special compilation, which is submitted to the Provincial Committee for the record, and the matters decided are notified to the主管局縣主管局縣 respective bureaus and counties for compliance. The Yongding River breach has not yet been closed, and the river water has entered the Daqing River, and the ice jam is very worrying. It is planned to set up defenses in sections four, five, and six of the Daqing River river affairs. The Provincial Committee has resolved to approve the payment of 3,000 yuan, which will be closely supervised by the Department of Construction.</p>
<h3>Li Shaogeng Discusses the Recent Situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>▲ Li's Views on the Sino-Soviet Conference</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, 8th: At around 10:00 a.m. today, I visited Li Shaogeng, the acting director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Board of Directors, at the Chinese Eastern Railway Board of Directors, and inquired about various issues of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Li said, "The postponement of the Sino-Soviet Conference does not cause much loss to the Soviet Union. This is because the point of contention between China and the Soviet Union lies in the Chinese Eastern Railway. The current situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway has also been restored to its original state, and Russia no longer has a strong desire to hold the Sino-Soviet Conference. However, the Soviet Union intends to take this opportunity to restore its overall trade rights and consular rights. In fact, the central government believes that these two issues are of great importance. In terms of trade alone, Russia is an economically blockaded country, and it is extremely strict in restricting foreign merchants from setting up businesses. Therefore, the establishment of a trade treaty only benefits one party, and we will become the tail of Soviet Russian trade. However, the long delay of the conference is also not a good idea, because today's Chinese Eastern Railway, after once being restored to its original state, has its powers entirely in the hands of the Russian side. The way to remedy this lies in the convening of the Sino-Soviet Conference. Our country knows that the establishment of a trade agreement will not benefit us much, but we can also use the point that the Russian side hopes for as a condition for obtaining some of the real power of the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the moment, the problem lies in the Chinese Eastern Railway. Since we do not have the strength to recover the rights of the railway, we must not sit idly by and allow foreigners to do whatever they want, which will leave future hidden dangers. Therefore, from this point of view, the central government is very supportive of the Sino-Soviet Conference being held as soon as possible, which is also a remedy after the fact. Recently, someone recommended me as the plenipotentiary of the conference. I have shallow qualifications and lack diplomatic talent, so how dare I take on this important task. As for the telegraphic power of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Director Li (Deyan) of the Liaoning faction came to Harbin and met with the Russian Director several times. The opinions were harmonious, and there is no problem in convening the meeting. The Russian side knew that it had been operating illegally before, so it did not propose automatic telephones. There will be some small problems during the meeting. The first is direct telegraphic communication with Moscow and Vladivostok, and the second is increasing sovereignty fees. The sovereignty fee in the previously signed contract was 2.1 rubles per word for commercial telegrams sent to Moscow and Vladivostok, and our side took seven cents as the sovereignty fee. Now, our telegraphic authorities want to increase the sovereignty fee, but the Russian side does not agree very much. As for direct communication with Moscow and Vladivostok, our side is afraid that the Russian side will spy on information and report it to the country, and advocates that outgoing telegrams must be checked. The Russian side also does not agree with this. My personal opinion is to suggest to the telegraphic authorities that border bureaus be set up on both sides of the border of Manchuria and Suifenhe, and that the Chinese Eastern Railway telegraph lines be connected to our lines. All telegrams sent abroad will inevitably pass through our telegraph bureaus, so that checking will be done without checking. This is a matter within our sovereignty, and the Russian side has no way to object. Director Li returned to Liaoning, and there may be a concrete plan, and the meeting can be held after his return. It is not difficult to predict that this matter will be resolved. There are currently no major disputes on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Everything has completely returned to its original state. Hua, the bureau director, is planning to employ the Chinese staff who were employed after July 10 after careful consideration. The Russian side does not object very much to the employment of Chinese staff. Therefore, the matter of Chinese staff who lost their jobs due to the restoration to the original state will not be a problem. However, some of the Chinese workers who were laid off have not yet resumed work, but this is only a matter of time. Even if they cannot be employed in the future, they will be paid one month's or half a month's salary depending on the circumstances, and will be given free tickets to return to their hometowns to seek employment. What the Soviet Russians hate most is the White Party. All White Russians employed by the Railway Bureau after July 10 will be dismissed. Those who are old and related to technical personnel are difficult for us to replace for the time being. If we are ordered to dismiss them now, we will have to replace them with Soviet Russians one by one. Therefore, for the sake of our rights and interests, we cannot but maintain the White Party for the time being. What the Russian side is most dissatisfied with is that the regular meetings of the Board of Directors cannot be held on time. Seven directors are the legal number for the Board of Directors. Currently, there are three Russian directors in Harbin. Among the Chinese directors, Guo (Fumian) is on sick leave, and Fan (Qiguang) is in Beiping for business. Only Yu and Shen (Ruilin) are left. The number of people on both sides cannot be gathered, so the meeting cannot be convened. Recently, because of the dismissal of White Russian railway staff who came to the bureau to cause trouble (according to Pi, this happened on January 26), the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow lodged a serious protest with our side, alleging that China's protection of the railway was ineffective, intending to make a fuss over a trifle and expand the negotiations. I do not yet know how our side will reply.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei boatmen stole from the escort, and the case was investigated. The families of Zhuang Guixiang and Zhang Guisheng, residents of Forty Maps Township, Tianmashan, reported that they were suddenly burglarized on the evening of the 12th. It was discovered the next morning that they had lost a lot of things, including head ornaments, noodle boxes, clothes, bedding, mosquito nets, cloth, and sundries. They prepared a list of losses and reported it to the local public security sub-station for investigation. It was learned yesterday that two Jiangbei boats belonging to Sun Sanxiaozi had been seized, along with a number of stolen goods. The Jiangbei people, men and women, a total of fourteen people, were escorted to the county for investigation along with the boats and stolen goods. The owners of the property, Zhuang Guixiang and Zhang Guisheng, also went to the county to await questioning. After the presiding judge Du Cheng conducted the trial, Sun Sanxiaozi, Wang Wenxue, and Su Fusheng were held for sentencing. The rest of the people were all family members and were not involved. The two boats were ordered to be returned to the Public Security Bureau for disposal. The stolen goods were claimed by the owners in court.</p>
<p>The Provincial Committee came to Songjiang to investigate the case. The Department of Civil Affairs previously received a telegram from various public organizations in the county accusing Wu Qinian, a committee member of Jinshan County, of disturbing the market with the police on New Year's Eve. The committee member has now been explained to the Zhenjiang Department of Civil Affairs by the county government. However, the truth of the case needs to be investigated in detail in order to solve it. Dai Hanwen, a staff member of the Third Section, was specially assigned to be responsible for the investigation. Committee Member Dai arrived in Songjiang on the 15th and paid a visit to County Magistrate Jin together with Tao, the Director of the Public Security Bureau. He consulted the case files and then went to the Chamber of Commerce, Ronghua Hotel, Songjiang Bank and other places to investigate. The results were roughly the same. It was heard that Committee Member Dai expressed at the Chamber of Commerce after the investigation that this mission focused on the disturbance of the market on New Year's Eve. According to the results of the inquiries from all parties regarding the matter of Cai Guangyao providing bail for Qian Yanglian, it was said that there was no such fact. Before letting Qian Yanglian go, Cai even met with Committee Member Wu, and Committee Member Wu did not ask the local government for assistance and took action directly, which was wrong. Committee Member Dai is temporarily staying at the Welcome Hotel and will have to return to the province to report tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>The term of office for the district chiefs has expired. The term of office for the thirteen district chiefs of Qingpu County has expired. County Magistrate Shen has submitted the names to the Department of Civil Affairs for appointment. Except for the sixth district chief, Jiang Minshi, who resigned due to illness, and Ye Zhen who was appointed to replace him, the certificates and letters of appointment for the remaining officials, including Wei Xiwu, the district chief of the first district, were issued and they were formally appointed.</p>
<p>He borrowed money unsuccessfully, and faked his death to scare people. A certain Gu from a certain town in Qingpu County was addicted to opium and gambling. The ancestral family property was almost exhausted. In the previous year, he sold a house to a certain surname. The contract was already exchanged and the price was paid. However, Gu spent the money shortly after the house was sold. Whenever he needed money, he would borrow from the person. It was not the first time. Unexpectedly, the other day, Gu lost at gambling and insisted on borrowing one hundred yuan from the person. The person refused because he had borrowed many times without repayment. Gu had a novel idea because he could not borrow the money. He grabbed a small knife on the table and pretended to commit suicide. Seeing this situation, the person was afraid that something unexpected would happen, so he called the police to arrest him. Seeing this situation, Gu knew that things would not work out, so he ran away in a panic.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Investigation and reply on the case of police arresting people across borders. Yuan Liang, the Director of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau, commissioned inspectors Liu Yunfang and Wang Zan to come to the county to meet with Song Shechen, the chief of the first public security branch of the county, Hua Shijun, the inspector of the county bureau, and Jin Chengxiong, the assistant of the second district office, to investigate the case of Chen Dian's arrest of people across borders at Qianjiazhai, Luoyang Township. According to Song Hua's reply to the county government, the men of the house were all avoiding. According to the old workers Gan Ayong and Qian Zhensan's wife, Xu Afu's son was getting married that night, and the three of them returned from drinking wedding wine. When they were about to reach Qianlong Bridge (the border between Jiading and Shanghai), they saw several plainclothes police officers standing on the bridge, asking for the password. Two people were grabbed and stripped of their clothes by the police. One person suspected that he had encountered a thief and ran back to beat the gong to report the alarm. Because the area is located at the border between Jiading and Shanghai, thief alarms occur from time to time. For self-defense, the villagers of the two counties have made a covenant to sound the gong as a signal. When they heard the sound, they gathered from all directions and rushed to the plainclothes police. The police fired several shots into the sky, but the villagers still tied up the police Liu Weibei and others, and snatched three guns, which were later taken away by unknown persons. The doors of Qian Zhensan's and other four families were damaged by the police. Qian and other twelve people were mostly arrested in their homes, and it is inevitable that some were wrongly accused. As for the lost guns and bullets, the people of the two counties were all present at the time, and it remains to be investigated who took them.</p>
<p>Eight counter-revolutionary criminals were sentenced to imprisonment. Xu Xintian and others, who were counter-revolutionary criminals instigated by the Communist Party in Xixiang in the previous year, were previously sentenced by the county government.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>The reason for the disintegration of various fire brigades. Members of the fire brigades in various districts of the county clashed with members of the Public Security Bureau when they went to rescue a fire caused by carelessness by a Mr. Huang in Xin County on the first day of this month. They also asked the Public Security Bureau to severely punish the member. After investigation, the county government found that the actions of the fire brigades were out of line. Now, the Public Security Bureau has detained Gu Sanyuan and other eight fire brigade members, and there has been no news of their release so far. Now, the fire brigade members in various districts have jointly resigned from their positions as fire brigade chiefs, and the chiefs of various districts have also resigned from the joint association. The executive committee members of the joint association have also expressed their negativity and cannot maintain it. The fire administration agency, which has been in existence for more than ten years, is about to disintegrate.</p>

<p>Police Officer Assists Evil and Abuses Power Xiao Jingshen, an 18-year-old villager from Yanqiao Town (Heavenly City) in the Fifth District of the county, has only a 73-year-old grandmother at home. Jingshen makes a living by doing small business in the area. On the tenth day of the eleventh lunar month of the past year, he suddenly needed to purchase goods, so he borrowed eleven yuan from Fan DiYun, a known opium den operator, deducting one yuan as interest at the time, with an agreement to repay it by the sixth day of the first lunar month of the following year, plus two yuan in interest. If overdue, additional interest would be charged. Unexpectedly, he was unable to repay it by the deadline, so he borrowed seven yuan from Ye Fengji and scraped together five yuan himself, totaling twelve yuan, which he returned to Fan on the seventh day. However, Fan claimed that it was overdue and demanded thirteen yuan, etc. After Xiao argued slightly, Fan twisted him to the 13th Sub-Bureau of the town's Public Security Bureau. There, police officer Fan Shaozhang of the sub-bureau held a sham preliminary hearing and severely beat Xiao Jingshen's palms dozens of times, also fracturing Xiao's head, causing blood to flow.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Murder Case Occurs at Tangtou Bridge Xue Ronggun, styled Shibao, from Luqi Village, Tangtou Bridge, Sihe Township, graduated from the Qing Dynasty Normal Training Institute and served as a member of the County Council. Since the National Army came to Cheng and the political system was reformed, he had been confined to his home. He had a dispute with his cousin Xue Lie (styled Picheng) over the collection of gun donations by the defense corps. Yesterday (the 13th) at around 10:00 AM, at the Xingmin Tea Shop in Tangtou Bridge, Shibao first borrowed a pistol from Cao Huiying, a partner of Qing Cijun Dadaian. Seeing Xue Lie talking to Zhang Ziliang, he fired the pistol repeatedly, hitting Xue Lie in the face and left armpit, causing serious injuries. Stray bullets hit the back and buttocks of Town Head Wang Wangchun. A tea guest, Chen Ruilin (from Chen Shazhuang), was hit in a vital spot, crawled into the field and died. Tea guest Liu Demin was hit in the left shoulder. A total of seven bullets were fired, injuring three people, who were carried into a boat and taken to Puren Hospital in Wuxi for treatment. However, Xue Lie and Wang Wangchun's injuries were quite critical, while Liu Demin was not seriously injured. After the incident, Shibao, having previously bought four yuan worth of morphine, ingested it in the tea shop and surrendered himself to the Defense Corps across from the tea shop. His daughter, Pei Xiu, upon hearing the news, rushed to check, and was taken into custody by the Defense Corps that night and sent to the city. At around 9:00 PM, Trial Judge Tong opened the court for interrogation. According to Xue Shibao's statement, he was 49 years old, a scholar, and he killed Xue Lie due to public and private feuds, long-standing and recent. He injured others intentionally and unintentionally. In 1926, when he was the Township Director, Xue Lie was a member of the Autonomous Committee and demanded that he hand over power within ten minutes, and sent Qingyang patrolmen to escort him. This was a long-standing cause. Now, he is an assistant in the District Public Office and the head of the Defense Corps, and he has been coercing gun donations. He only has 22 acres of his own land and rents over 10 acres, but he was ordered to donate five times as much, totaling 200 yuan, and his brother Shibao 150 yuan. On the 17th day of the eleventh lunar month of the past year, he even privately arrested his brothers and dragged them to the Defense Corps headquarters, pressed a gun to their necks, forced them to confess, and released his brother at 8:00 PM and him at 12:00 PM. In the winter, he prevented tenants from returning his rent, and his intention to kill arose from this. He wanted to eliminate this scourge of the people. This was a private feud. In October, Xue arrested a local merchant, Xue Aquan, and seized 12 packets of opium, confiscating 10 packets and sending 2 packets to the Public Security Bureau. At the beginning of October, Chen Abing had a pig stolen by thieves, and the villagers mobilized to catch the thief's boat. Xue Lie led the Corps to forcibly seize the thief's boat, clashing with the villagers. Last month, he also privately tortured a petty thief, Xue Yunian, breaking one of his legs. This was a public grievance. On the 12th, what triggered his intention to kill was that last night (the 12th), a secretary he had used during his tenure as Township Director, named Zhang Ziliang, copied his accounts of more than ten years and gave them to Xue Lie, and took away the accounts of managing the reclamation of over a thousand acres of wasteland at Kongjiawei, including the embankment construction project. He admitted that he had embezzled 100-200 yuan. Zhang exposed his shame. On the 17th day of the lunar calendar, Xue Gongsan, a member of his clan, asked him to talk about clan matters. He told him that Xue Lie had collected many of his misdeeds and was going to break with him completely. He hated it so much and decided to kill this thief to eliminate his private and public grievances. He also decided to commit suicide, so he swallowed morphine. When asked where the morphine came from, Xue claimed he did not want to harm people. After strict questioning, he finally confessed that he bought it on the 19th day of the eleventh month at Ye Fuchu's house in Shizhong (Qingcheng City, Wuxi). After eating it, he surrendered himself to the Defense Corps and tied up his eldest daughter, who came to see him, with a rope, intending to inflict illegal punishment, but was stopped by the instructor, etc. Then, his daughter, Xue Peixiu, was questioned. She said that she went to inquire after hearing the news of her father's murder and was detained, and had no involvement. The court ordered Xue Shibao to be detained and released Peixiu on bail, pending a field investigation on the 14th.</p>
<p>Continued Interrogation Xue Shibao, from Luqi Village, Tangtou Bridge, Sihe Township, was carrying grudges and resentment, and used a pistol to injure Xue Picheng and four others, and kill Chen Ruilin. On the 14th, Huang Wangchun died in Xiyi due to his injuries. The body was transported back to his hometown. That morning, Trial Judge Tong, commissioned by the county government, led the recorder and coroner to the village for inspection. Xue's house had been destroyed by the villagers due to the murder, leaving nothing. Only two rooms on both sides remained. The bodies of Chen Ruilin and Huang Wangchun were placed in the house. After Judge Tong arrived in the village, he rested briefly at the Defense Corps headquarters and first interrogated Fengquan, the younger brother of the owner of the Yongquan Tea Shop. According to his statement, he was 20 years old. Xue Shibao shot Xue Lie and others, and he was in the store. He was shot in the front. He heard the gunshot and fled. After returning to the store, he saw the pistol lying on the floor, and Shibao swallowed morphine, etc. Then he went to the Xue Yongquan Tea Shop where the incident occurred and inspected it. According to Yongquan's statement, he was 34 years old. That day, Zhang Ziliang and Xue Picheng were in the Xingmin Tea Shop. Shibao had come to observe several times and then invited them to talk. He entered from the back door and shot repeatedly, hitting Xue Picheng, Huang Wangchun, and Liu Deming. Because Huang was shot, he fled painfully to the entrance of Xietai Chang and fell to the ground. Shibao chased out and shot again with the pistol, hitting villager Chen Ruilin in the right waist, killing him on the spot. Xue then swallowed morphine in the tea shop. After the interrogation, he went to Xue Shibao's house in Luqi Village and saw that the belongings had been destroyed, leaving nothing. The men and women had all fled. The families of the deceased knelt on the ground, crying and demanding justice. The interrogator questioned Chen Shangen, the nephew of the deceased, who stated that he was 30 years old and lived in Chen Shazhuang. His uncle went out for tea and was shot to death. The deceased was 53 years old, had no feud with Shibao, and had two sons and three daughters. The deceased's wife, Chen Lu, was 43 years old. Her husband was dead and she demanded justice. The judge ordered Cao to carefully examine the body and found that he was shot in the right waist and died. He then instructed the corpse's family to carry the corpse back and not to make a scene or cause trouble. This case will be handled by law and they left with a signed statement. At 2:00 PM, he walked to Shizhuang to catch a boat. Halfway, he learned of the news from Wuxi that Huang Wangchun had died at 10:00 AM, and encountered a gasoline boat transporting the body. He ordered it to stop and boarded the boat for inspection. The deceased's wife, Huang Wu, stated that she was 34 years old, the deceased was 33 years old, and there was an elderly mother and five children at home who needed support and justice. After Cao examined the body, he found that he was shot in the right buttock and the bullet remained in the lower abdomen, causing death. He ordered a signed statement and went ashore to Shizhuang to catch a midday steamer back to Cheng.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Temple Fair Turns Deadly At the Beian Temple in Taiping City, over a thousand villagers held a welcoming god competition during the Lantern Festival.

<p>Guns of Guangling Town Sub-Bureau Seized by Bandits After the chief of Guangling Town Public Security Sub-Bureau, Zheng Zhong, was shot and killed by bandits, the bureau still had three fast guns, which were stored by a certain patrol leader at the home of Zhao Shoushan on East Street. At the time, no one knew. Recently, however, the bandits discovered this. On the afternoon of the eighth day, a group of bandits arrived, dividing themselves to guard the main intersections of the streets, and sent several others into the house, pointing guns at Zhao's heart, forcing him to hand over the guns. Zhao had no choice but to take the guns out of the wall, and the bandits left with the guns. At that time, a member of the bandits' gang was in the Yongyuanmao Winery opened by Mao Guo, demanding 100 yuan. While they were in a standoff, the bandits who had taken the guns from Zhao Shoushan's house rushed out. The bandits fled in panic, so the Mao family suffered no losses.</p>

The crowd then went to the Fifth Elementary School, destroying all the doors, windows, walls, desks, podium, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. The town's water police then opened fire to suppress them, and they dispersed. Zhu Asan, Gu Afang, Wang Amao, Qin Yingsheng, Zhu Guilin, and Li Xinxiang were arrested on the spot. The next day, another person with a certain surname was arrested and sent to the Wuxing County Government for transfer to the court for investigation.

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Compilation of Business Closures in the North City Jiaxing's commerce has been affected by poor harvests in recent years, and many businesses have suffered losses.

<p>Rescheduling Discussions on Additional Surcharges Due to a lack of educational funds in Jiaxing, 5,000 yuan of the foundation was used last year to provide financial support. Last winter, the education authorities invited representatives from various legal entities to discuss adding an education surcharge of one cent per tael/stone to the land tax compensation to repay the foundation. The representatives did not realize that there was already an education donation of several cents in the land tax and blindly passed it. While it was being submitted to the county and province for approval, Jin Rongjing and Sheng Bangchan from Jiaxing, who were staying in Shanghai, telegraphed the province, stating that the education donation had already been added to the land tax, and if it was increased again, it would be like piling bed on top of a bed, and the people could not bear the burden. They respectfully requested that the county be stopped. Subsequently, the province ordered the county to reconvene representatives from various legal entities for review. Therefore, the county government scheduled a meeting of representatives from agricultural, commercial, and industrial legal entities at the Education Bureau at 1:00 PM on the 20th of this month to discuss everything.</p>

<h3>Senior Cup Semifinal: Lok Wah vs. Western Germany</h3>
<p>▲　Tied at one…</p>
<p>▲　Fung Wan-yau… Injured and out</p>
<p>The giants of the Chinese and Western football worlds, Lok Wah and Western Germany, engaged in a fierce battle at Shen Park yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. The match drew a large crowd of Chinese and Western spectators, who were kept on the edge of their seats, unsure of the outcome. The game ended in a 1-1 draw, leaving the question of who would advance to the Senior Cup final unanswered. The referee was Mr. Shi Daotuo.</p>
<p>▲　Lok Wah Boasts Outstanding Talent</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, Lok Wah displayed an indomitable spirit and unparalleled skill. Their swift attacks were overwhelming, but fate intervened when Fung Wan-yau was injured and had to leave the field, like losing an arm. Fortunately, the team's spirit remained high, and they scored a goal with precision. However, their momentum faded, and Lok Wah gradually declined from their peak. Although their attack weakened, their defense remained strong, preventing Western Germany from getting a penalty kick and achieving a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>As a reporter who witnessed the entire match, I believe that Lok Wah's success as a top team lies in their ability to know themselves and their opponents, and to attack and defend effectively. Captain Li Huitang directed his teammates with ease, commanding them to attack or defend as needed. He excelled not only in his football skills but also in his cleverness and tactical acumen. When Lok Wah lost their key player Fung Wan-yau, Li Huitang retreated to a defensive position. This strategic move allowed them to hold on and secure a draw.</p>
<p>Among the hardworking players, goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan deserves special recognition. His eyes were sharp, and he was full of courage, often making daring saves. Bao Jiaping in the South and Zhou Xianyan in the East are two renowned goalkeepers, unmatched in the Far East. Zhou's performance yesterday proved his reputation. Other notable players included Sun Sijing, who covered both offense and defense, Li Ning, who was well-positioned, Chen Zhenhe, who ran the entire field, and An Yuansheng, who was strong in both heading and tackling. The forwards, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, and Xi Qiaosheng, also made significant contributions, adding to Lok Wah's strength. However, left winger Chen Bingxiang was less effective, as he was too eager to attack without a plan and failed to make the most of his strengths. If Li Huitang had been by his side to guide him, he might have achieved more. Fung Wan-yau, injured and off the field, could only watch his teammates fight on, feeling helpless.</p>
<p>▲　Western Germany's Average Strength</p>
<p>Western Germany, which fought hard for a draw, is known in Shanghai for their courageous play. However, at the beginning of the match, they were overwhelmed by Lok Wah, causing them to lose their composure. It was surprising that they didn't perform like the heroes we expected. After Fung Wan-yau's injury, when their momentum should have increased, they were too eager for victory and acted rashly. Lok Wah's forces, like a descending general, swept down from a thousand miles. As the whistle blew, they lost a goal, a mistake they would regret forever.</p>
<p>However, in the second half, the entire Western Germany team rallied, attacking from all directions with impressive strength, showing a desire to conquer all. But alas, their strong attack was met by Lok Wah's strong defense, leading to a back-and-forth struggle. Fortunately, they were rewarded with a penalty kick, resulting in a draw. Otherwise, they would have returned empty-handed. Center forward Snook was closely guarded by Sun Sijing, making it difficult for him to move. The wingers ran quickly but failed to deliver accurate crosses, wasting opportunities repeatedly. Inside, right inside midfielder Neigoer was the most effective, while the others performed their duties.</p>

<p>▲　Energetic and Strong, Gaining an Advantage</p>
<p>As the bell rang three times, signaling the start, Lok Wah launched an aggressive attack. Soon, An Yuansheng arrived, and the team's morale soared. Li Huitang sent a long pass, and Xi Qiaosheng dribbled forward before passing to the center. Western Germany's inside midfielder mishandled the ball, and Chen Jiaqiu seized the opportunity to shoot powerfully over the goal. Then, Fung and An combined to defend. Soon after, Xi crossed from the right, forcing a corner kick. Chen Jiaqiu took the corner, and the ball landed five or six yards in front of the goal. Sun Simin met the ball and shot it towards the left corner. Right inside midfielder Neigoer intercepted the ball and cleared it.</p>
<p>The sudden injury and departure of General Fung Wan-yau greatly impacted the overall situation. Li Huitang retreated to defense. Taking advantage of the situation, Li broke through and passed to Dai Linjing, who shot the ball straight into the net. This happened ten minutes after the start of the match. Later, Western Germany's right winger launched a solo attack, followed by Li Huitang making a heroic save. Then, Xi made a wonderful cross, but Dai headed the ball over the goal. Lok Wah continued to play with ten men, maintaining their strong formation. Twenty minutes later, Western Germany gradually improved, surrounding Lok Wah on all sides. Zhou Xianyan was like a fish in a pot, suffering greatly, like the target of many arrows. Zhou Xianyan was agile and skillful, resolving the dangers. When Fung was injured, Li replaced him, highlighting the importance of defense. In the last ten minutes, Xi Qiaosheng broke through alone and crossed the ball, but Chen Bingxiang missed the opportunity. Lok Wah led 1-0 at halftime.</p>
<p>▲　Exhaustion Leads to a Draw</p>
<p>In the second half, Western Germany changed their strategy, launching a full-scale attack. Lok Wah's momentum was not as strong as in the first half, but their defense remained solid. Initially, Chen Jiaqiu attacked the opponent's goal, but the ball went over the net. Then, Lok Wah was under attack from all sides. Zhou Xianyan followed the ball closely, making every save possible. The dangers were indescribable. In the 18th minute, Lok Wah conceded a penalty kick, which was scored by Carter, tying the game at 1-1. By this time, Lok Wah was exhausted, and their situation deteriorated. The entire team focused on defense. In the last eight minutes, Lok Wah made a final effort. Dai Linjing and Chen Jiaqiu broke through the defense, and Xi Qiaosheng got a shot on goal but was blocked by goalkeeper Snook. In the end, both sides had no more chances, and the game ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball: Two Matches Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲　Qiangnan Loses Again to Women's Youth…22-18</p>
<p>▲　West Youth Wins Thrilling Game Against McLing…30-29</p>
<p>Two matches were played in the Women's Open Basketball Championship yesterday, both evenly matched and exciting. West Women's Youth won against Qiangnan again with a score of 22-18 in extended time. West Youth Red team came from behind to beat McLing 30-29 in the last ten seconds. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲　Qiangnan Loses Again: Qiangnan's performance has been declining recently, and it is unlikely that they will win again. They lost their first game against West Women's Youth. Yesterday, the two teams played their second game at the Zhonghua Basketball Hall. Both teams fought hard and were evenly matched, with the score difference never exceeding one or two points. At the end of regulation time, both teams were tied at 17 points, so they played an additional five minutes to determine the winner. Women's Youth continued their efforts and won 22-18. The referee was Wu Bangwei. The forwards of Women's Youth were very fast, especially Miss Xun Na, who scored 14 points, the most on the team. Guo Xiaoping performed best on Qiangnan, and Wu Peihua also scored 7 points, but her performance was not excellent. In the first quarter, Women's Youth won 6-4. In the second quarter, Qiangnan won 5-4 (Women's Youth 10, Qiangnan 9 at halftime). In the third quarter, Qiangnan won 4-2, tying the score at 13-13. Each team scored 4 points in the fourth quarter, resulting in a 17-17 tie. In overtime, Women's Youth won 5-1, giving them a final score of 22-18.</p>

<p>▲　West Youth Prospers: West Youth Red and McLing played at the YMCA yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. The competition was fierce. McLing, with their strong players, gained an advantage everywhere. The game was very close. In the last ten seconds, McLing was leading West Youth 29-28, seemingly on their way to victory. However, West Youth was fortunate. Center Jie Hansheng made a long shot from half-court, scoring the winning basket as the game ended. West Youth won 30-29.</p>

<h3>City First Stadium Basketball Game: Nanguang Wins 26-16 Against Quanhei</h3>
<p>The Nanguang and Quanhei basketball teams played a friendly match at the City First Stadium yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. Quanhei's left and right forwards and inside midfielder were replaced by reserves, weakening their lineup. Nanguang played with exceptional courage, resulting in a well-deserved victory over Quanhei. The score was 7-6 in the first half and 19-10 in the second half, for a total score of 26-16. The referee was Zhang Longhai. Today at 9 AM, the Maotai and Pufeng teams will play a football match at the same stadium.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Navy Wins Against China League</h3>
<p>▲　East China-South China League Loses 1-2</p>
<p>▲　Li Huitang Scores One Goal for East China</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Sports Association organized the East China-South China League team, taking advantage of the East China team's presence in Hong Kong, to play against the strongest local Navy football team in order to showcase the football skills of Chinese athletes and demonstrate to the outside world. Although Wu Jinquan and Cao Guicheng were unable to play, and Chen Zhenhe had returned to Shanghai, the League team still possessed considerable strength. In fact, this was the best League team that East China and South China could field in Hong Kong at that time. However, there was an unfortunate hidden problem, which the reporter learned on the 6th but could not reveal to the readers: Lin Yuying was suffering from a cough, Huang Rui had a skin disease, and Li Tiansheng, Li Huitang, and Ye Beihua all had minor foot injuries from continuous strenuous matches, preventing them from fully demonstrating their skills and ultimately leading to their defeat. However, after watching the game, we must acknowledge the Navy's excellent skills and our team's lack of coordination. In the first half, both teams were very quick, and the forwards of both teams did not attack until they were close to the goal, creating tense moments for the opposing team. The China League team performed well in the first half, but their lack of coordination and the Navy's excellent defense prevented them from winning. In the second half, the Navy dominated the game, and the China League team rarely broke through the Navy's defensive line. If Chen Guangyao had not made a cross, allowing Li Huitang to score a goal, the China League team would have suffered a shutout. And if Chen Xipei had not made several heroic saves, the loss would have been more than two goals. The team lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>▲　China League Team Lineup</p>
<p>Lin Yuying Ye Beihua (Left) Li Tiansheng Li Huitang Chen Xipei Huang Ruihua Dai Linjing (Right) Feng Wan-yau Sun Jinshun Sun Sijing Chen Guangyao</p>
<p>▲　Navy Team Lineup</p>
<p>Evans Diggens</p>
<p>(Right) Jones Giles 良士 Deal Beecroft (Left) McKerrigan Gillis Stephenson Egan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the Navy forced a corner kick, followed by a corner kick for China League. Bicroft's shot missed the goal, and Sun Jinshun's shot hit the side of the net. After another corner kick for China League, Li Huitang's shot was too high. Then, Chen Xipei bravely saved several dangerous shots. As the China League team launched an attack and seemed about to win, Li Huitang's cross missed the goal. Then, Lin Yuying bravely used his chest to block a shot, showing great courage. After that, Chen Xipei saved the China League team from danger several times. Sun Jinshun's shot from Ye Beihua's cross missed the goal, ending the first half with no score. In the second half, the Navy launched a fierce attack. After about seven minutes, the China League team conceded a corner kick, and Beecroft scored a goal in the ensuing melee. After conceding a goal, the China League team's momentum declined, and they were constantly attacked by the Navy. After conceding the eleventh corner kick, Diggens scored another goal. The China League team continued to face danger. Near the end of the game, Chen Guangyao's cross allowed the China League forwards to launch an attack, but they were blocked. Li Huitang got another chance and scored a goal, making the score 1-2, giving the Navy the victory.</p>

<h3>Minquan Warship Conducts Sea Trials and Gunnery Practice Outside Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲　Results Even Better Than Previous Sea Trials</p>
<p>The Minquan, a new warship of the Navy, previously sailed to Minhang for sea trials, with very satisfactory results. Now that the ship's shells, various military supplies, and spare parts have been installed, it sailed out of the Wusong Estuary at 7:30 AM yesterday for another sea trial, as well as to test various shells. Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan was unable to come to Shanghai due to his busy schedule, but he sent Director of General Affairs Li Shijia and Director of Ordnance Lin Xianxin to inspect the ship's maritime navigation capabilities and the accuracy and range of its artillery. The ship had not sailed for half an hour when a thick fog appeared, but it continued to move forward bravely. When it arrived at the Wusong Estuary, it slowed down slightly. When the fog cleared at 10:30 AM, a wooden stake one mile away could be seen clearly, and the fastest speed of 20 knots and the amount of coal used at various speeds, as well as the number of revolutions of the propeller blades, and the use of steam and manual steering were tested. The results were all very good. Next, live ammunition was fired. Each cannon fired two shots, and four of them hit the target, while the others were about ten yards away from the target. Director Li immediately sent a telegram from the ship to the Navy, which was acknowledged with approval by Vice Minister Chen. At 5 PM, all the tests were completed, and the ship returned to Gaochang Temple. It is said that it will soon sail into the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee's Telegram to Yan</h3>
<p>▲ Inquiring about the Truth of the Telegram</p>
<p>To Comrade Yan Xishan of Taiyuan, greetings. It is rumored that you sent a telegram to our party leader Chairman Chiang, advocating concession for the sake of the country and agreeing to step down. Upon hearing this, we were greatly shocked and bewildered. The revolutionary goal of our party is to seek freedom and equality for China. To achieve this goal, we must use extremely strict discipline to command all party comrades to work together towards this goal. Our party is a revolutionary party fighting for a historical mission. The integrity of our country's territory and the peace of the whole country depend entirely on the success of our party's struggle. To achieve this success, we must rely on strict discipline. Party members, except for obeying the party's orders, are absolutely not allowed to have any personal actions. The entire body and mind must be dedicated to the party. The individual rights of party members have been sacrificed for many years, and we have worked hard based on this, making countless sacrifices to achieve today's situation, all as a result of the supremacy of doctrine and strict discipline. Last year, feudal warlords from various quarters repeatedly launched rebellions, defied orders and raised troops, and violated the central government, which not only undermined our party's discipline, but also shook the foundation of the nation. In order to maintain the party's discipline and safeguard the security of the party and the country, our party had no choice but to authorize Comrade Chiang Kai-shek to send troops to suppress them. From the rebellion of the Gui warlords and the Northwest rebellious army to the rebellions of Tang Shengzhi and Zhang Fakui, our party has always followed this principle and sent troops to suppress them. In no time, the rebellious warlords were all eliminated one by one. This is a factual proof that anyone who violates the party and betrays the central government and harms the interests of the nation will eventually be subject to the most severe sanctions of our party. All our comrades should deeply understand and be vigilant about this valuable lesson. Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, in accordance with the orders of the central government, is entrusted with the full responsibility of national affairs. This is the important task entrusted to him by our party, and it is also the obligation that Comrade Chiang personally owes to the party. Comrade Chiang should obey the party's orders and work hard on the revolutionary work. Before receiving the orders of our party, he must absolutely not have any private actions. The supreme duty of revolution is to seek happiness for the people, not to seek rights for oneself. As far as party members are concerned, there is no such thing as personal rights, but the responsibility must be borne. For several years, Comrade Chiang has always followed the resolutions of our party and worked hard, without considering his personal interests. At this time of national crisis, with internal and external troubles constantly intertwined, our party needs Comrade Chiang to continue to struggle unremittingly. Comrade Chiang must also absolutely not violate party discipline and shirk responsibility with his personal will. All party comrades regard Comrade Chiang as the only leader of the Chinese revolution today, eagerly anticipating and obeying his leadership, in order to strive to complete the national revolution. We must not allow Comrade Chiang to retreat and abandon the entire party. Now, at this moment, we suddenly hear that Comrade Chiang has the idea of concession for the sake of the country and agreeing to step down. In our humble opinion, we really dare not agree with this. To deliberately shirk responsibility is not an attitude that revolutionary comrades should hold. You, Comrade, have always advocated peace, but you should know that under the doctrine of our party, there is no other way to obtain true peace except to support the central government. And supporting the central government must first be to abide by party discipline. Revolutionary soldiers have no territory and no private army. Their only obligation is that since they have been entrusted by the central government, they must absolutely obey the government and work hard to serve the people to the death. Revolutionary party members have no rights and no selfish desires. Their greatest responsibility is to abide by party discipline, obey the party's orders, and seek happiness for the people. The central committee of our party has always been guided by the principle of serving the public good, and has always been determined to achieve peaceful unification. Therefore, anyone who raises troops and creates chaos and undermines discipline, the central government must, according to the demands of the people, regard them as the public enemy of the people, and must send troops to suppress them in order to unify and make the country independent. This is the policy decided by our party, and it is absolutely not any individual's private intention. Therefore, the military action to suppress the rebels is an act to maintain our party's discipline and uphold the interests of the people, and it is by no means comparable to an ordinary civil war. Its victory is the victory of our party's doctrine, the victory of our party's strict discipline, and it is by no means the victory of any individual. This is the basic concept that revolutionary soldiers should have. However, rumors are circulating that your telegram has the misconception that Comrade Chiang Kai-shek's responsibilities are rights, and therefore advocates concession for the sake of the country and agreeing to step down. We absolutely dare not make presumptuous conjectures about this kind of attempt that is close to blackmail, because we have always had deep trust in you, Comrade. However, public opinion can melt gold, and rumors may have some basis. Although we love you, Comrade, we dare not be sure that a gentleman will not have minor faults. Therefore, we specially inquire about the truth of the telegram and hope that you will give a clear reply to dispel doubts and benefit the party and the country. We are looking forward to it very much. The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang kowtows and requests deletion and printing.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Banning Silver Imports</h3>
<p>▲ Matters Concerning British and French Trade with China</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Ministry Notifies Britain and France to Prohibit It</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance, due to foreign merchants importing silver, which affects the silver market, has specifically ordered the customs to strictly prohibit the import of foreign silver. This was reported in the newspaper. Now it is learned that foreign merchants import silver mostly from India, Annam, and other places, which concerns British and French trade with China. It is necessary to first inform the governments of Britain and France to stop the sale of silver to China, and then it will be effective. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry has formally notified Britain and France to strictly prohibit the sale of silver to China from India and Annam. Then it will be easier for the customs to handle. Because the Jianghai Customs has diplomatic relations, it is temporarily difficult to announce and implement it. It will be announced and implemented after the British and French governments are informed. However, it is imperative. The rumors spread by foreigners due to vested interests are mostly rumors and have the opposite effect.</p>
<h3>Opium Investigation Group to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Departed from the Philippines Yesterday</p>
<p>Manila, 15th (Associated Press) - The Opium Committee of the League of Nations, after touring the Philippine Islands to investigate the current situation of opium, boarded the President Lincoln today to come to Shanghai. The group had previously gone to India, Java, and Singapore for investigation.</p>
<h3>Important Shipping News of the Jianghai</h3>
<p>▲ Seven Sea Vessels Resuming Business Xie You'an, a member of the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters, wrote to the Shipping Association, stating roughly that he had received a telegram from Director Qiu Wei, stating that the case of the eleven vessels going to sea had been approved by the General Commander and would be postponed for further discussion and would be returned to the companies for normal business. Yesterday, Member Xie had already returned seven vessels, including Taishun, Heng'an, Zhonghe, Fengxiang, and Taishan, to the respective shipping companies. Therefore, the North and South Ocean routes of this port can operate as usual this morning, and the grains, groceries, and other goods accumulated by the Hakka people in Shanghai will also begin to be reported for loading on the Chinese vessels.</p>
<p>▲ Competition in Shipping Routes to Wenzhou In the past, only China Merchants Steam Navigation Company operated ships on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. After the addition of five or six hundred-ton oil engine ships by various sailboat companies in Shanghai last year, the Shanghai-Oujiang line suddenly increased by four ships. In order to compete for business, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also negotiated with the Oujiang Customs to reduce import taxes. By February of this year, Yili and Taizhou vessels on the Shanghai-Taiwan route were also dispatched to Wenzhou by Lian'an Company, and the number of Chinese ships on the Shanghai-Oujiang line suddenly increased to eight. By this month, the Japanese Showa Shipping Company added the Rokusan Maru of Kawasaki Company and operated on the Wenzhou and Shanghai lines, in order to seize the Zhejiang shipping rights and the transportation business of rapeseed, fresh eggs, and other goods to Japan. Therefore, after opening the route, they secretly reduced the freight, which was about 20% lower than the freight charged by the Chinese ships. Some Chinese merchants who saw through their conspiracy refused to load their ships, but some were greedy for the low freight and were enticed by their interests. The various Chinese ships are now seeking ways to save the situation and compete with them.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Situation of Cargo Congestion and Ship Shortage Since the 10th of this month, the three major shipping routes of the North and South Oceans and the Yangtze River have been in great need of tonnage due to the rush of cargo loading by the Hakka people. The Yangtze River route, such as white sugar and cloth, is very smooth, but because there are only three or four ships operating, the Sanbei Company yesterday stopped the Fuzhou route and replaced it with the Xinningxing vessel to Hankou, and also transferred the upstream tugboats to Shanghai to transport passengers and goods. Therefore, shallow-water vessels such as Hongyuan, Hongting, and Wukang were also dispatched as regular ships. In this situation of cargo congestion, foreign merchants have added routes one after another. For example, the upstream vessels of the Jiejiang Company, such as Yidu and Yiping, have been transferred to Shanghai to open special routes to Han and Yichang, and Riqing's Wuling and Yuanjiang have also been dispatched to Yichang. Yili's Jiahe vessel is scheduled to open to Yichang tomorrow, all fully loaded with cargo for export. Although Chongqing has not opened the route, yesterday the Hakka people in that port also telegraphed Shanghai to handle 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn, which will be transported to Yichang via the locust route. This time, during the cargo congestion on the Yangtze River, it is a pity that the Chinese ships have no routes to serve the passengers, so 70-80% of the cargo is taken by foreign ships. The following is a list of the routes and the Chinese and foreign merchant ships operating on the Jianghai routes in recent days (only regular ships are counted, temporary cargo ships are not included): (Route) (Current Chinese Ships) (Current Foreign Ships) Yangtze River 6 ships 26 ships South China 2 ships 21 ships North Ocean 4 ships 17 ships Yi Han 4 ships 19 ships In addition, the Fuzhou route, which has always been operated only by Chinese ships, has now been completely suspended by the four Chinese ships, while the Japanese ships have a total of one dedicated route and four combined routes. Also, on the North Ocean route, there are about ten temporary Chinese ships, while there are as many as sixteen or seventeen British and Japanese ships.</p>

It is now reported that Li has left Mexico and boarded the USS Johnson at the end of last month to return to China. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 18th of this month.

<h3>The Municipal Propaganda Department Held an Expanded Propaganda Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee Propaganda Department convened an expanded propaganda meeting at the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday at 2:00 PM, gathering propaganda committee members from all district Party headquarters and district branches in the city. More than ninety people attended, presided over by Chen Dezheng, Minister of Propaganda, with Xu Xingchu as the recorder. The meeting began with customary rituals, followed by a report from the chairman, providing a detailed analysis of recent domestic and international politics, and pointing out the propaganda efforts that comrades should undertake at present. Subsequently, propaganda committee members from various levels of Party headquarters reported in succession. Many important proposals were discussed and resolved. The details are recorded as follows: ▲ Chairman's Report Comrades, today we are convening an expanded propaganda meeting to discuss methods for promoting domestic goods. Because many branch organizations have not yet been perfected, although the number of attendees is quite large, it still does not meet our expectations. Recently, I had a thorough conversation with the comrades responsible for propaganda work throughout the city. Today is an excellent opportunity to first analyze the recent situation and then report on the efforts we should be making at present. First, regarding the domestic political situation, on the surface, China seems to have transitioned from the military administration period to the tutelage period. However, in reality, many rebellious military figures are still harboring ulterior motives, constantly seeking to expand their personal ambitions and shake the foundation of the country. Recently, the heads of the five Yuan of the National Government issued a letter to all military personnel across the country. In this letter, they expressed their expectations for the military with a very earnest tone, along with stern rebukes and sincere guidance. Under these circumstances, the reason why the heads of the five Yuan of the National Government had to issue</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Fourth Sheet</p>
<p>this letter to all military personnel must be because there are still rebellious military figures plotting to cause trouble within the country. From that letter, we can derive several feelings. First, we understand where the foundation of national peace lies. Within a country, if we want peace and no internal strife, we must be united in one heart and one mind, sharing a common ideology and a common cause, with everyone working for the country and seeking the happiness of the people. If both the top and bottom levels have this kind of discipline, national peace can be built very firmly. Those in positions of power should treat people with sincerity, always prioritizing the interests of the nation. Those at the lower levels should also prioritize the nation, encouraging each other with integrity, morality, and a sense of honor. Military personnel should also regard obedience and sacrifice as their sole responsibility, adhering to the principles, not being tempted by profit or coerced by power, and supporting the central government. In this way, national peace can be obtained, and true peace can be truly realized. True peace comes from supporting the central government. If everyone is trying to maximize their own interests, national peace will never be realized. Second, we understand that peace can be true or false. Many people use peace as a signboard and as a shield, but in reality, they are deceiving the people and destroying peace. They hope that China will not be unified and will remain in chaos, and then they use the rhetoric of maintaining peace to realize their personal ambitions. These people are even more detestable than the politicians who ran errands for the warlords in the past. What they advocate is false peace, but what we need is true and lasting peace. We should realize true peace under the support of the central government, and we should realize lasting peace in the interests of the people. If we regard temporarily coexisting while actually dividing the country as peace, we absolutely do not need it. Third, the purpose of the state establishing officials is to do things for the people, not to find territory for a few people, nor is it to be a reward. Whoever has worked hard and made great contributions should be rewarded. Officials are the servants of the people. They are appointed by the state and entrusted by the people, so they should seek the interests of the people and work for the country. For policies decided by the central government, no official has any other choice but to absolutely obey. But what are the officials of China like now? Not to mention those corrupt officials, there are still many officials who, on the surface, are commissioned by the government, but in reality, they are causing trouble for the government everywhere. These officials are disloyal to the country and disloyal to the people. How can we tolerate them? We can see from the disloyalty of officials how difficult peace is to obtain. If officials disobey the government and act on their own, it is no different from rebelling, and rebelling is destroying peace. This is something we all know. From the letter to the military personnel from the heads of the five Yuan of the National Government, we can see that lasting peace can only be obtained under the condition of supporting the central government. Therefore, all officials throughout the country must take the will of the central government as their own, absolutely implement the policies of the central government, and work together to achieve true and lasting peace. Therefore, we comrades responsible for propaganda work should, in the near future, tell the people based on this meaning, so that the people can all understand the current situation. This is the first point I want to tell you all today. Second, there are now many people who sing high-sounding slogans, irresponsibly copying the methods of the Communist Party and making many wild claims. This is the most detestable thing. We know that in the current difficult and distressed situation of China, how many people can support this urgent situation? How many people can support the dangerous situation and then engage in great national construction? I am afraid that apart from our revolutionary leader, Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, no one else can bear this responsibility. But now there are many people who irresponsibly sing high-sounding slogans and nonsensically say that we should learn the style of abdication and concession from the Tang, Yu, and Xia dynasties, and make all the people learn abdication and concession. Such high-sounding slogans will not only fail to save China, but will also make China perish quickly. If we are loyal members of the Kuomintang, we should recognize that these high-sounding slogans are a conspiracy to shake the foundation of the Party and the state, and are the same as the Communist Party's last tricks. Whoever sings these high-sounding slogans is trying to shake the foundation of the Party and the state, and is not our friend. We should treat them in the same way that we treat the Communist Party. Revolutionary parties only talk about right and wrong. If it is something I should do, whether people scold me, say I am clinging to power, or ridicule me for showing off, I should remain consistent and unmoved. Revolutionary parties should not be timid or afraid of death, nor should they be coerced by power or tempted by profit. They should not be swayed by the old methods of dealing with warlords that can shake the sense of responsibility of revolutionary parties. I hope you will refer to Comrade Chiang Kai-shek's speech in today's newspaper and my report just now, and make practical propaganda to the people so that the people know the difference between revolution and counter-revolution and understand that the revolutionary party has a pre-planned plan when doing things and will never change or abandon it halfway. This point is very important and is specially reported out. Please pay close attention. Third, I also have a point to report regarding foreign affairs. Recently, there have been two relatively important events in foreign affairs: one is the Sino-Soviet negotiations, and the other is the issue of the Provisional Court. The Provisional Court has now been decided to be reorganized, and many unwarranted special treatments for foreigners have been abolished, which can be considered to have come to an end. However, we still need to make further efforts to recover the concessions as soon as possible. Regarding the Sino-Soviet issue, Cai Yunsheng's actions of exceeding his authority and humiliating the country cannot be excused. From the perspective of the China Eastern Railway incident itself, Zhou Longguang cannot be excused either. Now the central government wants to correct this matter, so it has dismissed and investigated those who cannot be excused and at the same time sent Mo Dehui as a representative to Moscow to discuss Sino-Soviet negotiations. This is a major event in the history of Chinese diplomacy, regarding China's sovereignty and survival, Mo Dehui will come to Shanghai from Beijing and will soon go to Shenyang from Shanghai and then to Moscow. At this time, we must awaken the people of Shanghai and contribute sincere opinions to Mo Dehui, hoping that Mo Dehui can act in accordance with the opinions of the people, and at the same time, we can also know that there is the people behind him as a backing, so he can negotiate with the Russians with confidence. I also hope that you can publicize this to the people so that the people can urge Mo Dehui to do it according to our intentions and not repeat the mistakes of Cai Yunsheng and Zhou Longguang. Fourth, regarding the domestic economy, the recent gold-expensive and silver-cheap trend has had a great impact. China's current monetary system has not been unified, nor has it changed the tael to yuan, nor has it adopted the gold standard, so China is the country most affected by the gold-expensive and silver-cheap trend. Therefore, prices have risen sharply, imported goods are extraordinarily expensive, the common people have suffered great losses, and people's livelihoods have suffered great harm. Regarding this issue, on the government side, there are specialized agencies and talents who can think of many ways, such as unifying the monetary system, changing the tael to yuan, prohibiting the import of silver, and adopting the gold standard, etc. However, on the people's side, there is also a very beneficial thing to do without causing any harm, that is, promoting domestic goods. If we can make all the people in the country use domestic goods and everyone has a firm heart to boycott imported goods, no matter what we wear, eat, live, or use, we can use domestic goods. In this way, no matter how expensive gold is or how cheap silver is, it will not have a great impact and loss on the national economy. Therefore, the central government has made promoting domestic goods one of the seven tasks of the lower-level party headquarters. Now is a good opportunity to work hard to promote it, so I hope you can publicize it to the people. Tomorrow, the Municipal Propaganda Department will have a propaganda meeting to promote domestic goods. I hope that you can not only participate yourself, but also lead comrades and compatriots to participate. Fifth, regarding international politics, there have been two relatively important events recently: one is the London Naval Conference, and the other is the general election in Japan. The nature of the last London Conference and the previous naval conferences of the great powers can be said to be the same. They are completely conferences to deceive weak and small nations. We don't need to concentrate our efforts to study whether there are results or not, anyway, this is completely a trick played by the great powers. Regarding the general election in Japan, some people are making dreams again, thinking that their domestic political war will have some impact on China. In fact, no matter which party is in power, they all hold an aggressive policy towards China and are always our enemies. Unless they can abandon their aggressive ambitions, they can become our friends. This is a past fact that has told us very clearly. I hope you can recognize these things clearly and when someone has a dream, you can remind and explain it to him. Finished.</p>

Standing Committee members Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, and Zhu Chengzhang, and Office Director Yang Guangxing, all attended the discussion, revised the association's charter, and drafted a preliminary plan. It adjourned at 9:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Resume Operations One After Another</h3>
<p>The Shanghai silk factory industry reduced work and stopped machinery at the end of the year due to the sluggishness of the foreign silk market last year. However, since the Lunar New Year, the silk sales in Europe and the United States have turned around and silk prices have gradually risen by more than one hundred taels. Therefore, various silk factories are seeking to resume operations. In addition to more than 20 factories such as Xinchang that have already started work one after another, in the past two days, more than 10 factories such as Yuncheng have also started their machines one after another.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Inspection Fee Standards</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has determined to implement the inspection of exported Chinese silk on March 1st and has already notified all silk merchants for their reference.

<h3>Wusong Merchants Petition for Reduction of Ship Tax Resolution</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Port Authority, regarding the matter of representatives from the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, Chongming, Hai'ning, Shaoxing, and Shandong sand fishing boats petitioning for a reduction in ship taxes, convened a meeting at the Port Authority yesterday at 2 PM, gathering the Finance Bureau, Wusong Chamber of Commerce, etc., to discuss solutions. Attendees included Zhu Zhi of the Finance Bureau, Xi Dingmo, Director of the Port Authority, Zheng Shushan of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, Zhuo Xiangguang of the Wusong Finance Bureau Ship Tax Office, and Yang Shaozhen of the Port Authority Registration Office. Xi Dingmo chaired the meeting. Items discussed: (1) The Chongming, Hai'ning, Shaoxing, and Shandong sand boats come to Shanghai several times each month. The boat owners find it impossible to pay taxes each time. They request the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to petition for a reduction in tax rates. How should this be handled? After discussion, Zheng Shushan, Chairman of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, representing the boat owners, detailed their difficulties and requested a reduction in taxes to ease their burden. As a result of the discussion, taxes for sand, stone, and charcoal boats, regardless of size, were changed to one yuan per trip. The method for other large sailing boats from various regions will be determined after investigation. Before the investigation is completed, the Wusong Chamber of Commerce will be responsible for recording the tax expenses of all boat owners, it is said.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Urges Collection of River Management Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau issued an order yesterday to various ferry bureaus within the county, stating: "It has been found that this bureau previously received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department urging the collection of funds for the management of inland river ferries. Orders were issued to all ferry bureaus to implement the collection starting from January of the 19th year. However, more than a month has passed, and the bureau has not received any submission of funds from your bureau's manager, which is highly inappropriate. In addition to ordering the commissioner to directly collect from your bureau in accordance with the rules promulgated by the department, this order is hereby issued, instructing your manager to immediately comply with the assessment and submit a response within three days of receiving this document, without any delay, to avoid any inconvenience. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Sand Township Residents Oppose Construction of Oil Tanks</h3>
<p>Although the Asia Petroleum Company's plan to construct Jia Si Ling oil tanks and warehouses on over 500 mu of reclaimed land in Gaoqiao Sand has been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, the residents of the area have collectively opposed it, and the matter remains unresolved. The company dispatched engineers to the area to plan the construction project and invited engineers from the Dredging Bureau, including Chinese engineer Huang Yan, to survey the coastline. However, the local residents immediately gathered hundreds of people, creating a tense atmosphere, preventing the engineers from working and forcing them to return to Shanghai to report the situation.</p>
<h3>Standardization Process for Weights and Measures in This City</h3>
<p>▲ Completion of standardization within two years</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Party Department will assist in publicity</p>
<p>This city is a major industrial and commercial hub, with dozens of different public and private weights and measures in use, resulting in extreme complexity. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, formerly the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce, had a plan to organize and unify weights and measures throughout the city. They had conducted thorough investigations into the weights and measures used in various industries and the manufacturing shops of various weights and measures instruments, preparing to proceed. However, due to the central government's proposal to standardize weights and measures nationwide, the plan was temporarily suspended, awaiting clear instructions. Now, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has separately formulated and promulgated regulations and standardization procedures for weights and measures. It is reported that the bureau has successively received a set of secondary standard weights and measures instruments and a complete set of various specimen instruments from the ministry. Furthermore, upon receiving instructions from the Municipal Government, the Party will, in conjunction with the Bureau of Public Utilities, follow the ministry's orders to formulate a standardization process for weights and measures in this city. It is expected that the standardization of weights and measures in this city should be completed by the end of the 20th year of the Republic of China. Preparations will begin on March 1st of this year, and the official establishment of the Municipal Weights and Measures Inspection Office will be the first phase, starting on July 1st. Subsequent phases will occur every six months, with the fourth and final phase completing the unification by the end of the 20th year of the Republic of China. The Municipal Party Department has also reportedly received a publicity outline on standardizing weights and measures nationwide from the Central Propaganda Department and will assist the Municipal Government in promoting the implementation of the new system, it is said.</p>
<h3>Supervision Issues for Public Utilities in the Special Municipality</h3>
<p>▲ Inquiries After the Repeal of Supervision Rules</p>
<p>Article 3 of the "Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities" does not explicitly address special municipalities. Furthermore, the "Shanghai Municipal Rules and Detailed Regulations for the Supervision and Management of Commercial Public Utilities" have been repealed by order of the central government. Regarding the issue of how to seek remedies for all previous contracts signed with commercial public utility companies, the three mayors of Shanghai, Hankou, and Nanjing Special Municipalities have submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, stating: "Submitting this request regarding the following matter. It has been found that Article 3 of the promulgated 'Regulations on the Supervision of Privately Operated Public Utilities' stipulates that jurisdiction over areas of operation belonging to a region are under the supervision of the county government; those belonging to a municipal region are under the supervision of the municipal government; and those belonging to two or more county or municipal regions are under the supervision of the provincial government, etc. Examining the meaning of the article closely, it appears that the term 'municipal government' refers to ordinary municipal governments. There are no explicit provisions for public utilities within the regions of special municipalities or those spanning special municipal and county regions. According to the 'Organizational Law of Special Municipalities,' the supervision of privately operated public utilities is a function conferred upon special municipalities by the central government. Is it possible that the central government, in promulgating these supervision regulations, did not include special municipalities because they had already obtained the right to supervise, or does it believe that special municipalities can formulate their own management rules based on the 'Organizational Law of Special Municipalities' and are not bound by these supervision regulations? Furthermore, ordinary cities and counties are both subordinate to the provincial government, so if jurisdictional powers cannot be divided, the higher-level agency can exercise them on their behalf. However, special municipalities are directly under the central government in the administrative system, with a status equal to that of provincial governments, and therefore cannot transfer the power of supervision to provincial governments that are not subordinate to them. Based on the above points, it seems clear that the term 'municipal government' in the regulations does not include special municipal governments. However, the original intent of the legislation is unknown and should not be speculated. As this concerns the interpretation of laws and regulations, we humbly request prompt instructions for compliance. Furthermore, the Shanghai municipality has particularly difficult circumstances, which we dare to present to your esteemed Yuan and Fu. Since the promulgation of the 'Rules and Detailed Regulations for the Supervision and Management of Commercially Operated Public Utilities' in Shanghai, each commercially operated public utility company should sign a contract with the municipal government in accordance with the regulations. Except for the Chinese Public Bus Company, which signed its contract on April 24th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, when these supervision regulations had not yet been promulgated, the contracts of other companies, such as the Hu'nan Public Bus Company and the Hu'min-Nan-Zhe Long-Distance Bus Company, were signed after the promulgation of the supervision regulations. All of their contracts include provisions for complying with these supervision regulations. Therefore, their various obligations, as stipulated in Articles 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 14 of the supervision regulations, are not listed within the contract terms. In the contract of the Hu'min-Nan-Zhe Long-Distance Bus Company, the articles regarding the municipal government, as stipulated in Article 13 of the supervision regulations, such as the municipal government joining as a shareholder or taking over operations, were also not specifically stipulated. Furthermore, the French Electricity and Lighting Company, which operates the Shanghai French Concession waterworks, established a water plant and laid water pipes within the municipal area based on a contract requiring compliance with municipal laws and regulations. Article 1 of the contract also stipulates absolute compliance with all municipal laws and regulations related to the company, and all regulations to be complied with are attached to the contract as appendices. Now that the 'Rules and Detailed Regulations for the Supervision and Management of Commercially Operated Public Utilities' have been repealed, the municipal government not only lacks a basis for demanding the Hu'nan and Hu'min-Nan-Zhe companies to fulfill their obligations, but it will also lack standards for punishing these companies in the event of future incidents. Even if it is not difficult to revise the contracts, whether these companies will use the central government's promulgated supervision regulations as an excuse to avoid these restrictions is uncertain. After careful consideration, there is no satisfactory solution. We humbly request that your esteemed office provide instructions on how to remedy this situation, along with the relevant documents, for compliance."</p>
<h3>Port Authority Completes Repairs to East and West Embankment Works</h3>
<p>▲ Total repair cost exceeds 60,000 yuan</p>
<p>The embankment works on the East and West Banks of this city are located near the sea mouth, and their protection of the lives and property of residents along the embankments is of great importance. After the Port Authority took over the embankment works, it found that many sections of the East Embankment, including the Rong, Zi, and Qiang sections, and the West Embankment, including the Tanjiabang and Yizhoutang sections, had collapsed and urgently needed repair. Moreover, since there were many dangerous works, carrying them out simultaneously would require a large amount of funds. Therefore, the bureau prioritized them according to urgency, first carrying out the emergency repairs on the Qiang and Zi sections of the East Embankment and the stone-filling project on the Rong section, and then undertaking the repair projects on the Tanjiabang and Yizhoutang sections of the West Embankment. It is now known that the pile-driving and repair projects on the Tanjiabang and Yizhoutang sections of the West Embankment have been completed and inspected by personnel dispatched by the Municipal Government. It is said that the total repair cost for this project exceeded 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ault Returned to His Country Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Thoughts on Departure from Chinese and Western Staff of the Electricity Company</p>
<p>Mr. Ault, General Manager and Engineer of the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Department, returned to England yesterday aboard the Russian Empress. Mr. Ault engaged in the electricity business in March 1901 and came to China in May of the same year, working with two Westerners and two hundred Chinese at the Electricity Department of the Municipal Council. He was 27 years old that year. Since then, he has devoted himself to promoting the electricity industry, successively serving as the engineer and general manager of the Electricity Department, and devising good strategies to advance the industry. Last year, he proposed selling the Electricity Department for a price of eight million one hundred thousand taels of silver, doubling the value of the electricity assets. His achievements are evident. The day before yesterday, friends among the Chinese citizens publicly presented Mr. Ault with a full set of golden tripods. The Chinese staff of the Electricity Company publicly presented a golden pagoda. On the 14th, more than one hundred and eighty Western staff of the Electricity Company held a farewell party for Mr. Ault at the Astor House Hotel. Music was played first, followed by a representative of the staff presenting Mr. Ault with a silver cigarette case and a book of staff signatures. The current General Manager of the Electricity Company, Mr. Villa, delivered a eulogy, followed by Mr. Ault's response. The guests and hosts then dispersed in joy.</p>

<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, a robbery and shooting occurred inside Manli Lane, Dadongmen, resulting in the theft of gold jewelry from a woman and the death of two people. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Ms. Ren's Family: Wang Yuquan, 41 years old, from Zhenjiang, is currently the manager of Yihetai Customs Brokerage at 51 Zhangchuan Lane, Xinbeimen. He lives at 4 No. 27 Lane, Dafang Lane, Dadongmen. His wife, Ms. Ren, is 40 years old and has five sons and one daughter. She is currently seven months pregnant.

The youngest son, Jiahua, is only 6 years old.</p>
<p>▲ Murdered While Buying Vegetables: At around 9 AM yesterday, Ms. Ren carried a bamboo basket to the Hongqiao vegetable market to buy vegetables. She was returning around 10:30 AM when, suddenly, two robbers caught up from behind in the western section of Manli Lane and grabbed her around the waist. One of the robbers forcefully seized a pair of gold bracelets she was wearing (weighing three taels). Not satisfied, the robbers also wanted to seize three gold rings and a gold bangle on her fingers. Ms. Ren resisted desperately and cried for help. Seeing her shout, the two robbers pushed her to the ground and opened fire, hitting her in the back.</p>
<p>▲ Innocent Bystander Killed: Qian A'xiao (27 years old, from Nanxiang), a partner at the clothing store opened by Wang Xiangqing at 94, opened the door to see what was happening. The robbers mistook him for someone trying to apprehend them, so they opened fire, shooting him. The bullet entered Qian's chest and throat and exited through his back, killing him instantly. The robbers fled with the stolen goods. After Ms. Wang Ren was injured, people carried her home. She did not make it to the hospital in time and died shortly after.</p>
<p>▲ Police Pursuit: After the incident, the local beat officer pursued the robbers without success and immediately reported to the First District, Third Precinct. Chief Jin immediately led Inspector Shi and other officers to search the area. The robbers were long gone. They then returned to the scene to investigate. According to witnesses, one of the robbers wore a black cotton robe and a copper basin hat and had a handgun. The other wore a short coat and a white woolen hat. After getting the loot, they fled north. After returning to the precinct, Chief Jin reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Two Autopsies: After the incident, Pan Bingtang, the local head of the Fifteenth Ward (Dafang Lane is in the Fifteenth Ward), along with Gu Sen, the local head of the First Ward (Manli Lane is in the First Ward), reported to the local court for an autopsy. At 3 PM, Prosecutor Zhu, along with autopsy assistant Shen, arrived at the scene. First, they went to the scene of Qian A'xiao's death in Manli Lane, where they confirmed that he had died from a gunshot wound to the chest. They filled out a form instructing the victim's brother, Qian Mugen, to prepare a coffin. The officials then went to Wang Ren's house in Dafang Lane for an autopsy. The deceased's husband and others requested that the autopsy be waived, which the officials approved. Instead, they ordered autopsy assistant Shen to examine the wound on the deceased Wang Ren's body before returning to the court by car.</p>
<h3>Tragic Suicide Due to Starvation</h3>
<p>▲ Zhou Jin Killed Her Son and Then Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Zhou Jin, a 46-year-old woman from Shaoxing, who lived in a straw shed at 50 Caoxi Road, West Shanghai (next to the Cattle Tax Bureau), lost her husband two years ago. She left behind four sons and one daughter. The eldest, A'kui, is 19 years old, the second, Yongtang, is 13 years old, the third, Xiangsheng, is 8 years old, and the youngest, A'bao, is 5 years old. The daughter, A'mao, is 17 years old. The family of six relied entirely on A'mao's lace-making work. Last spring, Zhou Jin gave her third son, Xiangsheng, up for adoption to a Chen family to alleviate the burden. The youngest son, A'bao, suffered from paralysis and had not recovered for years. A'kui, nearing adulthood, spent his time wandering and did not engage in honest work. Repeated warnings were ignored, causing frequent quarrels between mother and son. Zhou Jin felt increasing pain and developed suicidal thoughts. Recently, life had become even more difficult, and they had been without food for two days. On the afternoon of the 14th, she first strangled her youngest son, A'bao, on the loft, and then hanged herself. When her daughter, A'mao, returned home from work and saw her mother and brother hanging side by side, she was shocked. She managed to bring them down, but they were already dead. She then reported to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District. After receiving the report, Chief Xu ordered the local neighborhood head, Zhuang Yaoming, to report to the local court for an autopsy. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lei and autopsy assistant Shen were dispatched by the court to conduct an autopsy in the countryside. They found that Zhou Jin and her son, Zhou A'bao, had indeed died by hanging themselves. They instructed the relatives to prepare coffins for burial, it is said.</p>
<h3>Qidong Cables for Four Notorious Robbers</h3>
<p>▲ A Warship to Escort Them Today</p>
<p>Wang Qingfu, Captain of the Fourth District Patrol of the Wusong Marine Police, previously apprehended four notorious robbers, Huang Antai, Yao Degui, Zhang Guiyuan, and Zhou Lanfang, in the waters off Sheshan. After confirming their identities at the district office, they were detained in the Baoshan County prison for temporary custody, pending approval of their report. The office received a telegram from Qidong County yesterday, stating that the merchants in Qidong who had been victimized were pleading for them to be transferred to Qidong for immediate execution. After receiving the telegram, Director Li immediately prepared a document and dispatched Captain Wang and others to the Baoshan County Government to retrieve the four robbers, Huang Anqin, etc. Today, Captain Wang Qingfu has been instructed to escort them aboard the Shanghai-Hankou patrol warship to Qidong for trial.</p>

<h3>Yang Ermao Kidnapping Case Reopened for Debate</h3>
<p>▲ The Court Is Taking the Matter Seriously</p>
<p>The case of Yang Rongbao's son, Ermao, a track boss at the South Railway Station, who was kidnapped, killed, dismembered by the bandits, and for which Li Dahongzi, Lu Shijie, Xu Dianjie, Zhou Shilan, and Wen Dianluan were apprehended and prosecuted by the local court, has concluded its debate, with the verdict scheduled for February 15th. However, the court, after careful examination of the confessions, found discrepancies between the wounds on the deceased child described by the plaintiff Yang Rongbao and the wounds reported by the forensic examiner. Furthermore, the wounds on the deceased child confessed to by Li Dahongzi at the Zhenjiang Public Security Bureau also do not match. Moreover, the defendants all denied the charges in the public trial. Considering that the court, in rendering a verdict according to law, would have to impose the death penalty on one or two individuals, it was deemed necessary to ascertain the truth to ensure justice and prevent the execution of innocent lives. Therefore, out of caution, the court specially summoned the plaintiff Yang Rongbao and others to the court yesterday morning, along with the defendants in custody, to reopen the debate and conduct separate interrogations. After a long time, the court concluded that there were still many doubts in the case and that the witnesses were not complete. It ordered a further summons for interrogation and ordered the defendants to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Extortion Career</h3>
<p>▲ Doing Difficult Things for Others</p>
<p>▲ Current Rogue Behavior in Society</p>
<p>A Westerner, Fei Dao Xin Shiban'er Cai'er, reported to the French Concession Lujia Police Station a few days ago that a merchant, whose home is located at 51 Massenet Road, was returning home today when he was approached by two Chinese men, Zhou Xiaoxiang and Wang Muqing, who intended to cause trouble for the merchant. Therefore, he detained them and requested that they be arrested and investigated. Upon receiving the report, the patrol head immediately ordered a detective to arrest Zhou and Wang. They confessed that they were instigated by Chen Sanzhi, Zhang Hongbao, Jin Zhongying, and others. Subsequently, the detective arrested Chen and the other two and brought them to court yesterday for questioning. The plaintiff, represented by lawyer Ba He, claimed that the plaintiff was returning home when he saw the defendants lurking suspiciously in the garden. He immediately detained them and reported to the police for their arrest. During interrogation, the defendants confessed that a British man had a feud with the plaintiff and entrusted a comprador from a certain foreign firm to hire Chen Sanzhi and others to cause trouble for the plaintiff. However, the defendants became afraid and did not engage in any violent behavior. Although the plaintiff was not injured, he was greatly frightened and requested a thorough investigation. [Translator's note: There is a missing character here, making it unclear who is being referred to. I will proceed based on context] claimed that a British man, A, had told me that he had a feud with the plaintiff and wanted to ask the merchant to hire someone to cause trouble for him. The merchant then entrusted Zhang Hongbao to handle it. Later, the merchant feared causing trouble and immediately refused. [Translator's note: Another missing character] Zhang Hongbao confessed that someone had asked the people [translator's note: Missing character] to handle it. Later, the person [translator's note: Missing character] went to the Tongyuchun teahouse and talked about it with Chen Sanzhi, whom he knew. Unexpectedly, Zhou and Wang overheard the conversation and, without the consent of the people, directly reported to the plaintiff, hoping to get a reward, etc. Chen Sanzhi's confession was the same. Zhou Xiaoxiang and Wang Muqing confessed that they and Chen Sanzhi were eating tea at the Tongyuchun teahouse when they heard Zhang Hongbao and Chen Sanzhi talking about a British man who had a falling out with the plaintiff and wanted to hire someone to harm the plaintiff. The people secretly discussed it and went to the plaintiff to report, hoping to gain benefits, which led to their arrest. The Chinese and Western officials ordered the defendants to be returned to custody to await a joint court verdict.</p>
<h3>Deng Family Property Dispute Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ Both sides accuse each other with criminal charges</p>
<p>▲ Judge advises out-of-court settlement</p>
<p>Fang Danchi was from Huanggang, E Province, and a close relative of Fang Benren. When Fang was the Governor of Jiangxi, Danchi also held the position of Commander in Jiangxi. He resigned in the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), and the whole family moved to Shanghai. Initially, they lived in the British Concession, then moved to the French Concession. He had many dependents. Besides his parents and brothers who lived together, Danchi had three wives. The first wife had a son named Dacchan, now 23 years old, who is still studying. His first concubine left early. The second concubine, Deng, was young and educated. She was a friend of Deng Guannan from Jiangxi and was favored in the household. She never had any children. In the eighth month of the lunar calendar last year, Danchi died of illness in Shanghai. His mother also passed away shortly after. In the tenth month, his family escorted the coffins back to their ancestral home in Huanggang. Only Danchi's fifth younger brother stayed in Shanghai due to business. Deng Guannan, because his daughter was favored, relied on his status as the wife’s father and often stayed at Fang's residence. When Danchi was critically ill, he was also at his home. When the Fang family returned to their hometown, Deng went to Huanggang under the pretext of escorting his daughter. Soon, due to the inability of the wife and concubine to get along, he had to avoid them. Deng and his daughter then went to Hanzhao, relying on Danchi's seventh younger brother. Towards the end of the lunar year, Deng Guannan suddenly brought his second son by boat to Shanghai. Previously, Dacchan, after his father's death, discovered that a large amount of movable</p>
<p>property was left behind but stolen by Deng and others during the funeral. Repeated negotiations were fruitless. Now seeing Deng Guannan braving the wind and snow at the end of the year, possibly bringing documents to Shanghai to withdraw money, he also boarded the ship to Shanghai. They met on the boat but did not reveal their intentions. After arriving in Shanghai, they initially stayed at the Huanggang Guild Hall, (where Dacchan's fifth uncle also resided), then moved to the Grand Hotel in Hongkou. Deng's daughter also arrived in Shanghai from Hanzhao at this time. Dacchan immediately hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a complaint with the Provisional Court accusing Deng and his daughter, along with Wang Shutang and Wang Dahan, of conspiring to steal. Wang Shutang was a friend of Danchi, and Wang Dahan was Danchi's servant. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the estate was worth about 200,000 yuan, all deposited in various banks. In addition, there were gold pounds and gold leaves worth about 4,000 yuan. At that time, because the plaintiff was overwhelmed by grief, he was confused and unable to take care of the property. The stepmother Deng, colluding with her father Deng Guannan, Wang Shutang, Wang Dahan, etc., stole the entire estate. Despite repeated demands, there was no intention of returning it. Such a lack of conscience cannot be tolerated by law. Now Deng Guannan secretly came to Shanghai, intending to withdraw the bank deposits. The plaintiff, feeling the urgency of the situation, came to Shanghai to track him down, fearing that the defendant would flee after obtaining the money. He specially filed a complaint requesting the court to immediately detain the defendant Deng Guannan and also to bring all the defendants scattered in various places to justice, according to Article 337 of the Criminal Law, and with civil诉訟 attached. Judge Luo Renji handled this case. Judge Luo signed a summons and sent it to the Mixed Court Police Station to notify Deng Guannan to appear in court for trial on the 14th. Dacchan, fearing that Deng would escape upon hearing the news, stayed with him day and night in room 39 of the Grand Hotel in Hongkou. Deng's daughter then hired lawyer Song Shixiang and filed a complaint with the Hongkou Police Station on the 7th of this month, accusing Dacchan of kidnapping. The captain immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the hotel, arrest Dacchan, handcuff him, and escort him to the police station in a car. After Dacchan explained in detail that he had accused Deng and his daughter of theft, and that the summons was still at the Mixed Court Police Station, and that he was being falsely accused, he requested a thorough investigation. The captain, recognizing the circumstances, transferred Dacchan to the Mixed Court Police Station for questioning. He was released only at 6 pm that night. Dacchan, feeling unjustly treated, demanded that the police station charge Deng and his daughter with false accusations. However, they had already left the police station, making it impossible to detain them. The next day, he informed his lawyer Zhan Jifeng of the situation and filed another complaint requesting the court to detain Deng and others to face charges of theft and false accusation. Judge Luo immediately issued an arrest warrant and sent it to the Mixed Court Police Station. Deng Guannan and his daughter Deng were arrested and detained separately the day before yesterday, but the two Wangs have not yet been found. It was initially unknown where Shutang lived, and Dahan had returned to his hometown in Hubei. Deng also hired lawyer Song Shixiang to accuse Fang Dacchan of illegally detaining her father Deng Guannan and restricting his freedom. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo specially opened the First Criminal Court and ordered Deng and his daughter to be brought to court for interrogation. First, lawyer Zhan presented the case, then the plaintiff Fang Dacchan explained the course of events. When questioned, the defendant Deng stated that all the family property was managed by Danchi and his sixth younger brother Hechi. She had not taken a single item. The 36 gold pounds and approximately 10 taels of gold leaves were given to her by Danchi during his lifetime and had already been sold. This time, she came to Shanghai because she received a letter from her father saying that he was being held against his will. She initially stayed at the Ping'an Hotel, then moved to Wang Shutang's house at 35 Yong'an Street, and recently moved to the North Railway Station Hotel. Lawyer Zhan immediately stated that her testimony was inconsistent, as she initially stayed at Wang Shutang's house and later moved to the hotel. Deng Guannan testified that he was 56 years old and previously served as the secretary of the Wucheng Chamber of Commerce in Jiangxi. He met Fang Danchi in the city's salt bureau in the 5th year of the Republic of China (1916). He resigned from his secretarial position in 1925 and took his daughter to Nanchang, marrying her to Fang. Later, Fang resigned and lived in Shanghai, and he often visited. The plaintiff's accusation that deposit books, documents, goldware, etc., were given to him by his daughter was not true. Last year, he brought his second son to Shanghai from Hanzhao, intending to ask Wang Shutang for a job. He met Dacchan on the boat, who invited him to stay at the Huanggang Guild Hall after arriving in Shanghai. However, as soon as his luggage was unloaded, he and others searched his luggage and took away travel expenses, etc. Fang Dacchan strongly denied Deng's claim that he searched his luggage and took away cash. It was already dusk and there was no time for further questioning. Judge Luo, considering that the two sides had family ties, advised both parties to settle out of court and adjourned the hearing for two weeks. If no settlement was reached, further interrogation would be conducted.</p>
<h3>Chen Chen Divorce Issue</h3>
<p>▲ Judge Ge earnestly advises</p>
<p>▲ The wrongs of abandoning a wife for a concubine</p>
<p>The woman Chen Chenshi sued her husband Chen Maotou in the District Court for abandoning his wife for a concubine and neglecting his duty to provide support, requesting a divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge specially opened the Fourth Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Chen Chenshi, testified that she was 33 years old, from Shanghai, and her mother's home was in Yangjing, Pudong. She married the defendant Chen Maotou and had three children, one son and two daughters. The son was eight years old, and the daughters were eleven and three years old. The defendant often threatened to harm me. (Question) Where do you usually live? (Answer) No. 25 Chenjiazhai, Qichangqian, Pudong. The defendant did not care for my daily life. The defendant drove me out, so I live at my mother's house. In May last year, he wanted to kill me because he had married a concubine named Zhang Xiaomei in December the year before, through the matchmaker Chen Linsheng. Now the house at No. 25 Chenjiazhai is rented by Chen Linsheng. (Question) Where does Xiaomei live? (Answer) First, they lived and cooked together, but in May last year, Xiaomei moved to No. 29. Since Xiaomei moved out, my support has stopped. The defendant Chen Maotou, 32 years old, who runs a leather shoe store, testified that we have always been good to each other. She went back to her mother's house on November 27 last year. (Question) Did you take a concubine? (Answer) Not a concubine, just a partner named Zhang Xiaomei. When she entered the door, Xiaomei kowtowed to her three times. I don't want to divorce, especially since she has three children. The judge then said to the plaintiff, now that you are separated, how about the defendant giving you some money every month? (Answer) I only need food to eat. If we separate, the defendant must give me forty yuan a month to cover expenses. At this point, the defendant interjected, saying that he was willing to support her but did not want to give money. The judge asked the plaintiff what she meant. (Answer) I have three young children, and we need a place to live. But the house we live in is currently occupied by Chen Linsheng, and they are unwilling to move out. The judge said that if Chen Linsheng is unwilling to move out, you can sue him in this court. The defendant also said that the plaintiff also took away five receipts for Fang Dan, and she must be ordered to bring them back. The judge asked the plaintiff how much she wanted each month. (Answer) Only forty yuan. The defendant said that he only earns twenty yuan a month. The judge scolded the defendant, saying that he was clearly mistreating his wife for his concubine, which was extremely hateful. The concubine should wear the same clothes as the wife, and the bedding, food, and use should be the same. The judge secretly told the plaintiff to go live at No. 15. (Answer) They drove me out. The judge said that if they injure you, come here to report the injury and we will handle it. If they kill you, we will sentence them to death. However, it is common for husband and wife to quarrel, especially since you are over thirty and have three children, who will soon be of marriageable age, so it is better not to divorce. The plaintiff replied that when she first married, the defendant's family was poor, but now they are wealthy. She now demands 800 yuan in alimony, and the children born will be returned to the defendant when they reach the age of sixteen. She is determined to divorce. The judge asked the defendant if anyone had advised him. (Answer) Chen Azhu advised me. The judge then instructed both parties to withdraw and wait for another summons for trial. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>One Woman, Three Husbands</h3>
<p>▲ The legal husband catches the adulterer; one on the bed, one on the floor</p>
<p>Lin A'gen, from Ningbo, 44 years old, worked as a tea server at the Xingzhou Hotel on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession. His wife, Fan, 25 years old, had been married for eight years. Fan was not unattractive and was known to be promiscuous. Disliking her husband's age, she wanted to indulge her desires, so she had an affair with Xiong Jinhou from Yangzhou. Soon after, she also had an affair with Chen Kunming, a friend of Xiong from Ningbo. Forgetting the old for the new, she secretly ran away from home in November last year and lived with her two adulterers, Xiong and Chen, at No. 1317 Zhonghua Road. After Lin lost his wife, he searched everywhere in a panic but could not find her. Recently, he finally learned of her address and went there the day before yesterday. After finding her, he got into a dispute with Xiong and Chen. Inadvertently, he accidentally broke a teapot on the table. Xiong and others demanded compensation from him. Lin had no choice but to leave in frustration. Yesterday, Lin went to the house again to try to negotiate. Xiong and others, anticipating that Lin would surely return to pester them, had already moved. By the time Lin entered, everyone was gone. At this point, Lin suddenly had an idea. Remembering that those who move are supposed to report to the Household Registration Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he went to the Household Registration Section of the Third Sub-district of the First District to report the situation and request an investigation. It was found that Xiong and others had indeed moved to No. 5 Baoqing Lane, Gaoxiangtou the night before. Lin returned to the area and reported to guard Du Tianxiang of the 12th post, who went inside with him. As expected, they saw Chen lying on the floor, while Xiong and Fan were lying together in bed. Lin was extremely angry and rushed forward to grab them all. The police took them to the station. During the preliminary hearing, Chief Jin, Xiong admitted to having an affair with Fan, but Chen denied it. Since the matter involved abduction and elopement, they were ordered to be detained separately pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Youth Suicide</h3>
<p>▲ Why did Lu Xuewen die?</p>
<p>▲ Seven or eight suicide notes</p>
<p>At around 7 pm the night before last, a traveler suddenly came to the Shangxian Hotel on Simalu and checked into room 53 upstairs, signing the name Lu Xuewen, 24 years old, from Anhui Province. After paying the room fee, he immediately closed the door and read "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio." At around 2 am yesterday morning, he called the waiter to make tea and buy glutinous rice, and after eating, he closed the door and snored. Until noon, when the waiter called him to get up, there was no response from the room. The waiter became suspicious and managed to pry open the door. He saw the young man lying stiff on the bed. He immediately flew to the accounting room to report to the Xinzha Police Station. The captain immediately ordered detectives to investigate. Seven or eight suicide notes and two opium pipes were found beside him, indicating that he had committed suicide by swallowing opium. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital in a car, but it was too late to save him. He soon died. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was taken to the mortuary on Fielun Road to await an examination by the Provisional Court.</p>
<h3>Why abandon a body on the Bund after death from illness?</h3>
<p>▲ Awaiting autopsy</p>
<p>A young girl's body was found on the Bund behind the Ruiyong Shipyard in Yangshupu last Sunday. Her mouth was stuffed with cotton, suggesting she had been murdered. The police took the body to the mortuary on Fielun Road. After reporting to the Provisional Court for examination, it was ordered that the Pushan Villa take care of the body, and the police were instructed to investigate and verify the case. The police have now learned that the deceased was the daughter of Ding Huibiao, a Qingkou resident living on Taopeng Road. According to Ding, his daughter died of illness. The police believe that if she had indeed died of illness, there would be no need to abandon the body on the Bund, and that there might be other circumstances. Yesterday morning, Ding was summoned to the Provisional Court and questioned by Judge Sun. He was ordered to be temporarily detained. The police were instructed to return the coffin to the mortuary and wait for an autopsy to determine if there were any internal injuries, before conducting further investigation.</p>
<h3>Calamity of a Coal Stove</h3>
<p>▲ Two saved</p>
<p>▲ One killed by fumes</p>

The night before last, Cai's mother-in-law, Zhao Li (63 years old), together with Cai's 11-year-old daughter Xiuqing and 40-year-old maid Dai Taohua, lit a coal stove and slept in the same room. Yesterday morning at 7:30, when Cai got up to check, the three had already suffocated in the room. He immediately took them to Guangren Hospital on Baker Road for treatment in a car. After the doctor's efforts to rescue them, Cai's young daughter Xiuying and the maid survived. Cai's mother-in-law, Zhao Li, died shortly after due to her old age and frailty. The hospital then notified the family to quickly arrange for burial.</p>

<p>▲ Yu Bingyi and Li Xishan were spared</p>
<p>Shi Linchuan, who lived on Huanlong Road, French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits on the 2nd of last month. After his family received a letter from the bandits, they entrusted Yu Bingyi and Li Xishan to negotiate with the bandits. Later, Yu and others entrusted Dong Zexing to negotiate with the bandits, but it was unsuccessful. Dong committed suicide out of anger because he was ridiculed by Yu and others. The police arrested Yu and Li and sent them to the French Court for questioning. They were ordered to await further judgment. Yesterday, the Chinese and Western officials of the Mingtang Court acquitted the two defendants.</p>
<h3>Chen Yuming Not Guilty</h3>

Judge Sun then ascended the seat and announced the verdict: the defendant Chen Yuming was acquitted. The plaintiff's lawyer Ye Zhengkang, upon hearing the judgment, immediately rose and stated that the plaintiff was not satisfied and would appeal. Judge Sun then ordered Chen Yuming to still pay 300 yuan bail during the appeal period.</p>

<p>In order to provide cooked water beverages to the citizens of this city and to facilitate their purchase, the Social Affairs Bureau has formulated rules for the operation of cooked</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>water shops (tiger stoves). The establishment of new water stoves is not subject to old restrictions, and many have been added, which is convenient for the citizens. However, most people who open water stoves do not know how to read and write, and have to ask others to handle the writing of documents and applications, creating an opportunity for hooligans to profit from them. It is learned that the Social Affairs Bureau is sympathetic to the small people who set up stoves, and has specially printed all application documents to assist them. Applicants only need to fill them out, and those who want to set up a stove can obtain them from the Bureau without charge. Moreover, if the procedures for the application to set up a stove are not in compliance, instructions will be given within two days. If no instructions are received from the date of submission until the eighth day, the Bureau can be inquired. Such handling is intended to prevent ignorant small people from feeling isolated from the government. It is reported that the Bureau has revised the operating rules for cooked water shops and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval. The important articles are disclosed below: Article 2: Those who open cooked water shops shall submit two copies of the certificate of need from more than 50 nearby households (one address counts as one household, but the same address may not certify two shops), and two letters of guarantee filled out by two reputable shops in the city to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating the following items: (1) Name, age, native place, and address of the applicant; (2) Shop name and capital; (3) Location of establishment (must indicate the address number) and the situation of nearby residents; (4) Type of shop room and its area; (5) Distance between new and old shops (with drawings for explanation); (6) Side business. The certificate of need and letter of guarantee listed in this regulation have a fixed format, which the applicant shall obtain from the Social Affairs Bureau in advance. Article 3: The applicant shall, upon presentation of the business license, apply to the Public Works Bureau and the Finance Bureau for a building permit and a business license, respectively, before building the stove and starting business. Article 5: If a cooked water shop has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau but does not obtain a business license within one month after the approval is sent, or does not start business within one month after obtaining a business license, or privately transfers the license to others, it will be deemed invalid and the license will be revoked. Article 8: If a cooked water shop relocates, it shall re-apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of these rules. Article 19: Those who violate the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 8 of these regulations and open a business without authorization shall, upon discovery, be ordered to suspend business or be fined from five yuan to twenty yuan, and shall be ordered to complete the registration procedures.</p>

<h3>Shameless Girl and Strong Man</h3>
<p>▲ Detained for Fifteen Days</p>
<p>At around 6 pm last night, a young, fashionable woman grabbed a strong man at the intersection of Xinmin Road in Zhabei, and they were fighting each other. Pan Wenjun, the tenth watchman in the area, stepped forward to mediate, but they did not listen, so he took them both to the Fourth District General Office. According to the woman, Zhang Caiying, 21 years old, from Ningbo, lives in Changle Lane, Changan Road. Her parents are still alive. A few days ago, she went out shopping alone and met a man, Feng Alin, who flirted with her and enticed her with sweet words. For a moment, she was deceived and went with him to a hotel in Chenjiabang. He said he would give her two yuan after the affair. She lost her virginity for the sake of profit. However, he fled half-dressed, leaving her in the hotel. She was terrified when she could not find him the next morning. She hurriedly dressed and wanted to leave, but the innkeeper refused, demanding that she pay the inn fee. She had no money, so she had to take off her cheongsam and pawn it for the room fee. She returned home in disgrace, having been raped and losing money, and was rebuked by her parents. She was extremely remorseful. Unexpectedly, she ran into him on the street today and demanded that he compensate her for her losses and pay her the money he promised. The man, Feng Alin, who lived in Chengde Lane, Yuanqing Road and worked in a cigarette factory, confessed that going to the hotel for a tryst was her own will, and that he had already given her two yuan for the night. He claimed that she insisted on asking him for money and forced him to continue the affair. He refused because he had no money, and that's why they fought each other. After verifying the confession, the Chief deemed that both the man and the woman were shameless and sentenced them to 15 days detention as a warning.</p>

<h3>Rongchang Match Company Commences Operations Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Workers Must Fill Out Employment Contracts and Guarantees</p>
<p>The authorities at the Rongchang Match Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, due to the robbery and significant losses suffered by the second factory last year, which implicated factory workers, and to prevent future occurrences, submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau. Upon the cessation of work last year according to the lunar calendar, each worker was issued an employment contract and guarantee form in their name. These were required to be submitted to the factory before the commencement of work this year in order to be employed. At the same time, the factory regulations approved by the Social Affairs Bureau were announced for reorganization. The other day was the scheduled commencement date for the factory, but the workers had not submitted the contracts and guarantees. The company declared the day before that it would postpone commencement and closed the iron gates to prevent misunderstandings by dissenting workers. They then locked the factory gates, preventing staff from entering or exiting. The company requested a solution from the Social Affairs Bureau, which dispatched personnel, together with various agencies, to the factory in Pudong to resolve the situation, but they were unable to do so that day. The next day, both sides appointed representatives and resumed mediation at the Social Affairs Bureau. The result was that work would commence first, and all employment contracts and guarantees had to be submitted within four days, otherwise, they would be refused work. All mediation committee members and representatives signed on the spot. It is said that work already commenced on the 15th.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Orders Investigation and Prohibition of Liquor Stalls on Qiujiang Road</h3>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Launches Agricultural Experiment Station on a Trial Basis</h3>
<p>▲ Based on Cooperative Experiment Zones</p>
<p>The per-mu yield in the cotton planting cooperative experiment zone in the Luhang District of this city for the 17th year of the Republic was one to two times higher than that of ordinary cultivation. This has gained the trust of local farmers. In order to capitalize on this trend, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to expand the cooperative experiment zone. However, it is believed that the results of crops often vary according to the local climate and soil conditions. What is good in area A may not necessarily be good in area B. If each cooperative zone only promotes methods already proven successful in local research without conducting on-site research, it is feared that there will be no progress in agriculture. Therefore, it is proposed to immediately establish an agricultural experiment station to be closely linked and mutually supportive with the cooperative experiments, so as to achieve complementary effects. It is reported that the bureau has drafted a plan for the agricultural experiment station, temporarily divided into three departments: experiment, cooperation, and promotion. The station will be established on the site of the old Fahua Temple in Luhang District. The soil there is suitable, and irrigation is convenient. It is also convenient for experimenting with the three main crops: rice, cotton, and wheat. In addition to the continued operation of the Luhang District, the cooperative department will also include the Yangsi District, which is being organized by a municipal councilor with personal funds, and will add four other districts: Pusong, Zhenru, Yinhang, and Caojing, for a total of six districts. The bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government for approval.</p>
<h3>National Government Grants Preferential Treatment to Martyrs Zheng and Wang</h3>
<p>Based on the principle of honoring virtue and rewarding merit for revolutionary martyrs, the National Government has been progressively verifying and granting preferential treatment. Last month, Yang Xiaotian and others reported to the Central Party Headquarters that martyrs Wang Yunfeng and Wang Mingshan worked hard for the revolution and were loyal to their cause. They were arrested and executed in Shanghai for assassinating Zheng Ruocheng, and requested that they be given preferential treatment. The Central Party Headquarters reviewed the case and forwarded it to the National Government. It has been learned that the case has been approved by the 61st State Council meeting, and martyr Wang Yunfeng will be given a one-time consolation payment of 2,000 yuan, and martyr Wang Mingshan will be given a one-time consolation payment of 1,500 yuan. The Ministry of Civil Service has sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance requesting the allocation of funds to be sent to the government for distribution, and it has been clarified that the children of the martyrs will be sent to the dependents' school to study.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Invincible Brand General Factory Petitions for a Prohibition on the Use of the Name "Family Industry Society"</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Invincible Brand Factory, due to Wang Shaonan in Shantou using the name "Family Industry Society," petitioned the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for a prohibition. The petition stated briefly: "Previously, we received a circular from your ministry stating that the name of a company is critically important to its business credit and should be strictly prohibited from being imitated. Henceforth, once a company is registered, no company of the same type, regardless of whether it is from the same or a different province, may use the same name to avoid confusion. The same business with the same name, prefixed with a place name to distinguish them, is still considered to easily cause confusion and should be uniformly prohibited." The company's trade name "Family Industry Society" has been registered with the ministry. We have now read a news item in the 8th issue of the Shantou National Products Weekly stating that Wang Shaonan of Xianxi City, Anbu, established the "Family Industry Society," and published a certificate of commendation for Wang Shaonan's "Family Industry Society" granted to Wang Shaonan in the 15th year of the Republic by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. It does not contain the words "Family Industry Society." Our company's certificates of commendation granted by the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in the 10th year of the Republic, and the awards received at various provincial competitions from the 9th year of the Republic to the present, all bear the name "Family Industry Society," and are published in various newspaper advertisements for twelve years, which is known to the world. Wang Shaonan added the name "Family Industry Society" to his personal certificate of commendation out of thin air, evidently using our company's past advertisements to try to imitate it in the hopes that buyers will mistakenly believe they are buying products from our company. As a result, our company's sales in Shantou have been almost zero in recent years, which is a great hindrance to our business credit. Therefore, we must request your ministry to uphold fairness and quickly instruct the provincial government to order Wang Shaonan not to use the name "Family Industry Society" to avoid confusion."</p>

<p>▲ Introduced by the Ministry of Finance and Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, as well as the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, have investigated that the Shanghai Civilian Medical School, founded by Chu Minyi, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, etc., is purely of a charitable nature, beneficial to society, and its organization and plans are perfect. The hospital now plans to build a new facility and has specially dispatched representatives Liu Daofang and Hu Zhongying to the islands of Southeast Asia to solicit large sums of money. The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Government have prepared letters to overseas Chinese compatriots in Southeast Asia, urging them to provide strong assistance and make this righteous cause a success. The letters are addressed to Tang, the Consul General in Singapore, Hu Jiaohu, Lin Yishun, Chen Jiageng, Yu Dongxuan, Zhang Yongfu, Hu Zaikun, Liu Chunding, Hu Chongyi, Hu Richu, Liang Yu Nan, Wang Zhendong, and Zheng Daping in Ipoh, Dai Shuyuan, Consul in Penang, Lin Jiaohu, Dai Zhiwu, Qiu Mingchang, Lu Yunhuai, and Zhang Kunquan in Kuala Lumpur, among others. Three of the original letters are recorded below: (1) Respectfully informing you that Chu Minyi, chairman of the board of directors of the Shanghai Civilian Hospital, and Lin Kanghou and Du Yuesheng, presidents of the hospital, find that the hospital provides medical relief for the diseases of the common people, provides medical consultations and medicines, and the number of patients seeking treatment is increasing daily. The hospital buildings are crowded, and they plan to raise funds to build a new hospital to expand. They have now dispatched Liu Daofang and Hu Zhongying to Southeast Asia to solicit donations. We have long admired your enthusiasm for public welfare and leadership among overseas Chinese compatriots. We specially send this letter of introduction, hoping that you will strongly maintain and widely solicit donations to deepen our sense of relief. Sincerely, Song Ziwen. (2) Respectfully informing you that the Shanghai Civilian Hospital, founded by Chu Minyi, Lin Kanghou, and other colleagues, is purely of a charitable nature, providing relief for the poor and sick, with remarkable achievements. It has long been praised in Shanghai. However, because there are many people seeking treatment, the original site is insufficient to accommodate them. The hospital plans to raise funds to build a new hospital to expand the relief of the poor and sick. However, since this matter is significant and to see its completion, it relies on the righteous generosity of enthusiastic compatriots overseas to gather strength from all and complete this righteous cause. We have long admired your benevolence and tireless pursuit of good deeds. The hospital's director of general affairs, Liu Daofang, has been entrusted by the hospital to go to your region to solicit donations. We specially introduce him, hoping that you will strongly assist him, raise your voice, and the four corners of the world will respond, so that all the poor and sick in Shanghai will have hope for rebirth. We will further believe that the glory of national construction is nothing more than what overseas Chinese compatriots have bestowed. Wang Zhengting. (3) Respectfully informing you that the Shanghai Civilian Hospital is purely of a charitable nature. Since its inception, it has provided relief for the poor and sick with remarkable achievements. It is only that the hospital site is narrow, making it difficult to accommodate as many people as possible. The charitable gentlemen who founded the hospital, witnessing the suffering, felt the pain in their hearts and discussed raising a construction fund to build a new hospital and expand medical services to achieve the purpose of universal relief. The hospital has dispatched personnel to various parts of Southeast Asia to widely solicit donations, hoping to gather the strength of the crowd and achieve easy results. We have long admired your enthusiasm for public welfare, which we have always admired. We hope that you will raise your voice so that the new hospital can be completed as soon as possible, benefiting the sick, and the merits will be immeasurable. Sincerely, Zhang Qun.</p>
<h3>YMCA Clean Government Movement Conference</h3>
<p>▲ Third Day Record</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the YMCA Clean Government Movement, which was Thrift Day. The significant meaning lies in promoting the realization of a simple and frugal life among the people. The number of attendees was even more enthusiastic than the previous two days. At 5:30 PM, a lecture on diligence and thrift by Zhang Zhijiang was originally scheduled. Because Zhang was in Beijing and unable to return to Shanghai, Chen Liting gave the lecture instead. Yang Bingxun provided a speed-recorded transcription of the national phonetic alphabet entitled "On the Necessity of a Thrifty Life from the Economic Situations of Various Countries." The general idea was that the Chinese people have very good working abilities, but due to the developed mechanical civilization of Europe and America, one person in America can do the work of 35 people, and one person in England can do the work of 8 people. The increase in working ability is also the increase in wealth. This is in terms of production. In terms of consumption, according to investigations, the purchasing power of automobiles in Shanghai, compared with large cities of the same size in the United States, is half that of the United States. From this, it can be inferred that China's production is only one-thirty-fifth of that of the United States, while its consumption accounts for half. This is no different from the Chinese people earning one yuan a month and needing seventeen and a half yuan. How can this not lead to bankruptcy? In the evening, there was also a new play by the Jing Zhi Society. The purpose of this conference is to oppose harmful gambling dens such as roulette and dog racing tracks. Therefore, a joint petition was set up with the Hudong Commune, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and the Nanshi Puyi Society to request the concession authorities to prohibit them. By yesterday, the number of signatures had reached a vast number.</p>

Yesterday, a decision was made to increase the price of printing and dyeing by 50% of the original price, and for foreign cloth and foreign colors, the price would be settled according to the actual yardage without discounts.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper's local news column a report from the Daily News stating news from the Chinese Merchant Ship Masters Association regarding the Renhe steamship, etc. Upon reading it, I was shocked. After investigation, the Renhe steamship, which our company represents, was originally the Japanese ship Chofu Maru, which was purchased by Chinese merchant Mr. Xu. Because the ship's officers were the original crew, it was inconvenient to change them immediately. On October 5th of last year, the name was changed and registered with the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government. On December 6th, the ship received license number 2026 issued by the ministry and was registered with the Jianghai Customs. Therefore, there is no doubt that this ship is owned by Chinese merchants. Where did the issue of flying a foreign flag come from? The publication of this matter in the newspaper is related to reputation and damages business. Therefore, in addition to sending a letter to the Chinese Merchant Ship Masters Association to inquire, we specifically request that this letter be published in your newspaper's local news letter to the editor column for correction. Sincerely, Dehexiang Company.</p>

<h3>Occasional Notes on Yancheng</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiumei</p>
<p>Ten li south of Piling City is a place called Yancheng. Earthen mounds surround it in a circular shape, with two layers inside and out, resembling city walls. Beneath the city, streams flow like rings, with a vast and clear water surface that can be used as a mirror. The inner and outer city rivers have a circumference of five or six li. Only one path in the northwest corner is accessible. Inside, it is a vast plain with crisscrossing paths, a few smoky villages, and the sounds of chickens and dogs, a peaceful scene, very much like a utopia. In the center is a small round hill with several dilapidated temple buildings that are about to collapse. Several idols are arranged inside. In the broken walls, a stone tablet was found. Although the text is eroded, it can still be vaguely discerned. Upon touching and reading it, it is said that the place was called Ziluocheng. A traveling monk happened to pass through this land and was delighted by its remoteness from the mundane world, making it a suitable place for quiet cultivation. Therefore, he raised funds to build temples and resided there. Climbing the hill and looking around, the terrain is majestic, resembling the palace of a young emperor. Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai, a local gentry, once considered purchasing this land of barren temples as a burial place, but it did not happen due to the opposition of the residents. I heard from the elders in the village that at the end of the Ming Dynasty, there was a King Yan who fled here due to an incident. He dug earth to make ponds, accumulated earth to build a city, and provided for himself by farming. He defended himself by relying on this land. To the north of the city, there is a high mound, which is the tomb of the princess. The city river is extremely deep, and never dries up even in severe droughts. The farmland relies on it for irrigation, and the grain production is particularly good. The production of fish is very abundant. Every year in the hot summer, the villagers gather to catch them and always catch giant fish. There is a gloomy atmosphere inside the city. During overcast and rainy days, the sound of drums and gongs can often be heard. Other magical tales are like Qi Dong's wild words. Last year, I traveled with friends in early spring. The sound of orioles was everywhere, peach blossoms were everywhere, and the gentle breeze was intoxicating. The huts blocked the view. Looking at myself, I wondered if I had become a fisherman from the Wulin. After circling the city once, I got an interesting piece of information for my description. Every hundred steps or so, I saw the remains of grain stalks, with ash piled up, like a measurement marker. I asked about the reason and learned that there was a girl in the village who was about to get married. Her dowry was quite rich. Last night, a gentleman on the beam visited her. He searched for clothes and objects in a cloth bag. Just as he was slithering out of the hole, he was noticed by the owner. He shouted and chased him out. The villagers heard the sound and came out to help. It was dark and they couldn't distinguish anything. So, they took the firewood that was piled outside and lit it to illuminate the entire city. The clever ones rushed to guard the pass, making him like a turtle in a jar. The thief was anxious and couldn't get out, so he abandoned everything he had obtained and swam through two rivers to escape. This is the origin of the ashes. At that time, the spring ice had not yet melted, and the night was very cold. Even if he managed to escape, he would be very pitiful. I secretly laughed that he was proficient in the art of sneaking and breaking in, and there was no place where he couldn't use his skills. He had to come to this isolated place and bring about his own destruction. The thief was really stupid.</p>

<h3>Humorous Tales of Henpecked Husbands</h3>
<p>— Drunken Scholar</p>
<p>There are two common sayings in Jiangnan: "Henpecked husbands are all wealthy; those who bully their wives are poor for life." Another says, "Fear your mother-in-law and avoid trouble." This shows that there are benefits to being "henpecked." I have several friends who are all conquered by high-heeled shoes, and can be considered experts in being henpecked. Now, I will write down some of their achievements in being "afraid." However, if the readers' wives happen to see this and imitate it, then I will not be responsible. I hereby declare this.</p>
<p>Mr. A runs several shops, all managed by him, but he cannot control his wife in bed. Therefore, he has a reputation for being henpecked. One day, I met him at a banquet and saw several red lines on his face, clear claw marks. Everyone laughed and asked, "What is drawn on your face?" He stammered, "This... was scratched by a cat's paw." Everyone was surprised and said, "How could a cat climb on your face?" He said, "I was playing with a kitten and accidentally got scratched by its paw." I laughed and said, "I'm afraid it's not a kitten's paw, but a tigress's paw." Everyone burst into laughter. Mr. A's face turned red, confirming that he had been punished by his wife. Mr. B runs a candle shop, and people call him the candle young master. He truly listens to and obeys his wife. All day long, he drags children around, not shirking from hard work. It turns out that his wife is very keen on mahjong and spends all day playing mahjong at home. Therefore, she completely entrusts the responsibility of taking care of the children to her husband. Even if there is a pee disaster in bed at night, or the children are hungry, he has to get up and take care of it. His wife, however, is strategizing and carefree. Sometimes people say to Mr. B, "You work so hard day and night, isn't it too tiring?" He frowned and said, "It is a man's duty to obey. She tells me to do this, and I really can't think of any other way."</p>
<p>Mr. C always sneaks away early from evening social engagements. If his friends try to keep him, he always shouts "curfew!" It turns out that his "Ministry of Internal Affairs" has an order that he must return home by 10 p.m. at the latest. If he is late, he will be met with a closed door. At this time, he becomes an outsider, stuck in a dilemma. He must stand guard for a full hour before being pardoned and allowed into the room. He has tasted this kind of experience, so he obeys the order carefully and dares not disobey. This is his confession after drinking.</p>
<p>Mr. D's henpeckedness is also a cut above the rest. He also has a special skill, which is to do his wife's hair every day. He can create all kinds of fashionable hairstyles with ease. One day, I visited early in the morning and happened to see him and his wife doing this "upper-level work." I laughed and said, "Zhang Chang used to paint eyebrows for his wife, which has been passed down as a beautiful story. You are taking it a step further. Your good fortune is truly enviable." Mr. D also laughed and said, "If I serve her like this and she is not satisfied, I will still be scolded by her. This kind of good fortune is really a bit hard to bear." His wife heard this and smiled sweetly at the mirror, as if expressing the joy in her heart.</p>
<h3>A Record of the "Four Five Six Spring Banquet"</h3>
<p>— Ah Liang Sheng</p>
<p>I don't know where "Four Five Six" gets its meaning. There is a food company on Nanjing Road that is named "Four Five Six." Some people think that "Four Five Six" is followed by "Seven," and "Seven" is a homophone for "eat." However, in the Suzhou dialect, "Seven" has a sharp sound, while "eat" belongs to the rounded sound, and cannot be confused. The painter Yang Qingpan is from Huzhou, Zhejiang. He doesn't distinguish between sharp and rounded sounds, which is understandable, but when listening to his songs, he clearly distinguishes between sharp, rounded, yin, and yang tones. He probably doesn't think "Seven" is "eat." Maybe there is another meaning. The other day was the reopening day after the renovation of "Four Five Six." The host, painter Yang, invited dozens of Shanghai artists and writers to "cut the ribbon" for good luck. The first to arrive were Ye Gongchuo, Huang Binhong, Zhang Shanzi, and Di Pingzi, who is vegetarian and chants Buddhist scriptures. They gathered around a round table. Wang Yiting was drawing a Buddha image for the host, and Ye Yuhu had already written two "doufang" (square calligraphic works), which were placed to the left of the table. At seven o'clock, Chen Dieshian and his son, Zhou Shoujuan, the painters Zheng Manqing, Ma Mengrong, Qian Shoutie, and He Tianjian, and Chen Dazai and Kangshijun from the Xinwen Bao newspaper, as well as Yu Kongwo and others, arrived. Some painted, some wrote, all working on clean white paper boards that were no more than eight inches long and about seven inches wide. Li Haoran and Yan Duhe arrived last. Mr. Haoran's landscape paintings are extremely valuable and he doesn't easily put pen to paper for others. That evening, he created a landscape painting that was profound and elegant, which was praised by everyone. I especially love the landscape paintings of Qian Shoutie and Zheng Wuchang, and the plum blossom and pine paintings of Zhang Hongchi and Han Xiu. Ye Yuhu's running script is particularly vigorous, inspiring respect. The host also picked up a pen and wrote a Tang poem, making a total of thirty-eight pieces. I heard that they would be framed in gold and used to decorate the walls. I laughed and said to the host, "It is unprecedented in China for a food company to have such elegant decorations." That evening, all the artists and writers gathered on the third floor, which was decorated very elegantly and quietly. Wang Jiyuan, the Western painter, said that this floor should have a name, so that it would be worthy of this decoration. The host plans to name it "Spring Wine Room" and invite Tan Yankai to write the name. The banquet ended at midnight. I dipped my pen and wrote this to leave a trace.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Unique and Clean Sports Meeting</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Road YMCA held a Clean Sports Meeting to awaken people from their indulgence in smoking, drinking, and gambling. It lasted for three days, from the 13th to the 15th. I made a special trip to visit on the opening day. This was an innovative event, so I recorded what I saw below.</p>
<p>The venue was set up in the YMCA's reception room. Going straight up the escalator, there were slogans and illustrations on both sides, catching the eye. Moreover, the wording on the slogans was very novel, such as "A man who has no distant worries will have immediate troubles," "Accumulate little to make much," "Many grains of sand make a tower," and "Those who can be thrifty do not ask for help." The illustrations depicted women sinking into the sea of lust, old people not knowing how to save, and orphans not being cared for, all of which were enough to make people feel alert. The venue was filled with exhibits from various banks and charitable organizations. The participating banks included the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Yancheng, Zhongnan, Dalu, and Jin Cheng four banks' savings departments. Among them, the Shanghai Bank was particularly eye-catching, with a six-sided colorful pavilion decorated with red and green paper streamers. In addition, the Tong Yi Xin Company Bank Savings Department and the AIA Life Insurance Company also had exhibits. All of them were to persuade people not to gamble or prostitute, and to return to the path of thrift. The participating banks distributed brochures and catalogs to the visitors. Therefore, everyone had a bundle of red and green pamphlets in their hands when they left. In addition to the exhibits, there were also celebrity speeches, amusement events, and film screenings. Therefore, visitors came in an endless stream for days. The YMCA Bookstore also displayed various good books at the venue and sold them at low prices. Above the escalator, there was a plaque with the words "Think No Evil," which was even more profound in its intention.</p>
<h3>Scraps of Common Sense</h3>
<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>When going to the post office to send a package or a registered letter, never go on Monday, because Monday is the busiest day for the post office.</p>
<p>When weighing luggage at the train station, if the weight is over, you will have to pay extra. At this time, just borrow a ticket from someone who is traveling with you but does not have luggage, and you can pass the weighing.</p>
<p>Never exchange coins at the tobacco and paper shops near the train station and the shipping bureau, because these tobacco and paper shops mostly use zinc coins to deceive customers who are in a hurry to leave.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between upstairs and downstairs in small restaurants. Downstairs is much cheaper than upstairs. The same dishes are more plentiful downstairs. Because the restaurant's rule is to treat economical friends favorably.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (129)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: A Delicate Feast Opens, Beautiful Birds Sing; A Golden House is Decorated, Good Birds Choose Their Wood</p>
<p>One day, Yan Yichen called a "tangchang" girl but had her sit across from Zheng Yanxiu and spoke to him from afar. Yan Yichen laughed and said, "It's too much effort to talk like this. Let's just pass a note over." He quickly took a bureau ticket, wrote on it, and handed it to the girl. The girl was eager for Seventh Young Master Zheng to call her over, so she folded the bureau ticket into four and placed it behind the powder mirror, in the place where powder paper was kept. She sat with Yan Yichen for another five minutes and then moved over to Zheng Yanxiu's side. Yanxiu did not refuse. He felt that there was no difference between someone else calling a "tangchang" girl and him calling one himself. For the sake of convenience, it wasn't unacceptable to sit closer for conversation. Yanxiu had initially not been calling "tangchang" girls. Ever since he broke his rule, people would introduce good girls to him whenever they saw them. He didn't refuse anyone who came to him, because none of those girls were the noble person he desired. The so-called "It is not that I think of you" type. But since they welcomed him, he would interact with them one by one. However, there was one downside: all the "tangchang" girls that Yanxiu called over would stick there and not want to leave. No matter how the "tangchang" assistants shouted outside the door, "Fifth Miss! Sixth Miss! Zhang! Wang! Next one! Next one!" she would always sit there firmly, not willing to get up. Some would even sit for half an hour or an hour at Zheng Yanxiu's place when they only sat for five minutes elsewhere. Sometimes when two girls were called over, neither would want to leave first. They would sit there competing, seeing who would give up first. They would secretly get jealous, thinking that Seventh Zheng favored the other one and would become distant from her. In reality, none of that mattered. Yanxiu would secretly laugh in his heart. Sometimes he would see two "tangchang" girls sitting close together. He would think, "How clumsy these people are!" He would stand up and say, "I have another engagement. I'll be leaving first." When they saw him stand up, they had no choice but to leave as well. Because Yanxiu didn't care about any of those girls. However, Zheng Yanxiu had ultimately fallen into the trap of lust. As Buddhists would say, everything comes down to fate. Originally, there were many classes of courtesans in Shanghai. The highest were the "shuyu" (literary courtesans), followed by the "yao'er" (number two), then the "yeji" (wild chickens). In the past, there wasn't a category called "salty meat houses." Those places dedicated to carnal desires were called "ji" (brothel), which was a disgusting place. Beyond that, aside from the lowest-level flower-and-smoke rooms, the hell of rouge and powder, everything else fell into the "yeji" category. This is a Shanghai localism. Anything that isn't proper is called "yeji." For example, a ship that doesn't run on a regular schedule is called a "yeji" steamer. A carriage or chartered car that picks up passengers on the road is called a "yeji" carriage or a "yeji" chartered car. Therefore, unofficial prostitutes are also called "yeji" brothels. In reality, even within these "yeji" brothels, there are all kinds of levels. The low-level ones are, of course, the "yeji" who solicit customers on Qingzun Road on Fourth Avenue. The high-level ones, however, are superior to the average highest-level "shuyu."</p>

<h3>Financial Foreign Exchange Transactions Gradually Becoming Lively</h3>
<p>▲Qianzhuang (Money Shop) Sets the 18th of the National Calendar (Lunar) for the Commencement of Midday Trading</p>
<p>▲Market Overview: Yesterday was Saturday. The financial world is normally in a quiet period. At present, as there has not been an commencement of midday trading, the situation is especially quiet. However, in the morning market, buying and selling of foreign exchange by banks was quite lively. The bank's appetite for supply and demand was not weak, so the money shops' transactions also became busy. However, as the price difference was mostly met, there was no significant change. The money supply remained loose, and there was no interest rate for overnight loans. Currently, as various aspects of business are gradually developing, it seems necessary for money shops to add midday trading. Therefore, at yesterday's board meeting, it was decided to commence midday trading on the 20th (i.e., the 18th of the Gregorian calendar).</p>
<p>▲Interest Rate Prices (Foreign Exchange): The morning market was at 7 fen, 1 li, 8 hao, and 2.5 si, slightly better by 1 hao and 2.5 hu than the previous day. Midday trading has not yet commenced, so there is no market price. (Silver Exchange) remained at borrowing without interest, individual interest rates at the Small General Assembly, and banks' listed interest rates plus water were not traded in the market.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Situation: Jiangnan small silver coins weakened by another 1 li compared to the previous day, estimated at 6 qian, 3 fen, and 7 li, hovering around the same price as on Thursday, with 3,000 jiao traded. Guangdong small silver coins were at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 4 li in the morning market, the same as in previous days, with no increase or decrease, with 130,000 jiao traded. There was no midday trading as usual. Copper coins suddenly shortened by 6,000 wen, to 404,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver and Foreign Exchange Inflow and Outflow: (Silver) Yesterday, banks received and settled few payments. Chinese merchants received and settled over 1.5 to 1.6 million taels, foreign merchants over 900,000 taels, Japanese merchants over 1 million taels, and various cargo, remittance, tax, and miscellaneous payments totaled over 5.6 to 5.7 million taels. 800,000 taels were withdrawn from the warehouse. Money shops received and settled over 26 million taels in silver bills, over 1.7 million taels in overdrafts, and over 500,000 taels in remittances from various routes. Several tens of thousands of taels were received in cash. (Foreign Exchange) In the morning market, 1.38 million taels were made in remittance bills, 20,000 taels in banknotes, 85,000 taels in banknotes outside the market, 1.35 million taels in interbank transactions, over 1.1 million taels in bank foreign currency account transactions, over 900,000 taels in banknote inflow and outflow, over 3 million taels in money shop foreign currency bills, over 1.4 million taels in foreign overdraft payments, over 300,000 taels in overnight foreign exchange loans, and over 500,000 taels in small money shop interbank transactions.</p>
<h3>After the Price of Silver Fell, There Was a Rebound</h3>
<p>▲There Was No Major Inflow or Outflow in Deferred Transactions. The Gold Standard Price Reappeared on February 15. This Was Because Silver Bars Were Retracting and Exchange Rates Were Also Trending Upwards. Banks' Appetite Remained Good, So the Market Atmosphere Was Auspicious. However, There Were More Supplies Among the Counterparts. Taixing, Hengxing, Yuan Maoyong, and Tian Yuyong All Had Sales, While Buyers Such as Zhifengyong, Yuancheng Yongshunli, and Wanxing Also Bought. Deferred Transactions Have Arrived, but There Are No Major Transactions. After the Morning Market Silver Bars Retracted, the Opening Price Increased by 2 or 3 Liang, but Due to Uneven Supply and Demand, There Was an Increase or Decrease of Over One Liang. Afterwards, Sellers Were Very Diligent. Exchange Rates Also Saw Weakness and Have Depreciated by a Few Qian, Falling from Above 83 Liang to Within 81 Liang. At Noon, American and Japanese Banks Suddenly Bought Cash, and the Price Was from 81 Liang to 2 Liang. The Buyers in the Market Seemed to Be Active. As a Result, It Rose Again by Over 2 Liang. Exchange Rates Tightened. Banks Made Recent British Gold for Two Shillings and Sold Japanese Gold for One Liang One Fen to One Liang One Fen One Two Five. In the Afternoon, Because It Was Saturday, the Market Was Closed as Usual. British Silver Bars Have All Been Reduced by Sixteen Thirds, and Silver Prices Have Also Fallen by One Eighth. Exchange Rates Have Not Changed.</p>
<p>▲It Rebounded 3 Liang and 7 Qian Higher Than Before. The March Gold Standard Price Opened with an Increase of 2 Liang and 6 Qian, at 82 Liang and 8 Qian. Then, It Rebounded from 2 Liang and 9 Qian to 1 Liang and 8 Qian. It Was Pulled Higher by Over 1 Liang Due to Purchases by Dalian Banks. The Gross Price Was Seen Over 83 Liang, 4 Qian, and 5 Qian. As For Foreign Exchange, the Bank's British Gold for This Month Is 2.00625 and Mitsui Bought Japanese Gold for 1.00625. Subsequently, Sumitomo Sold April Gold for 1 Liang 1 Fen to Sterling. The Unchanged Announcement Was Announced. However, Bo Xing and Others Still Had Strong Selling Intentions, So They Retreated to 82 Liang, 5 and 6 Qian. There Were Fluctuations of 7 and 8 Qian.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Shows Slight Signs of Stability</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation has stabilized somewhat again, mainly because the foreign market continues to be firm and actual sales are still not sluggish, which has slightly calmed people's minds. The biggest difficulties currently felt by the yarn market are increased inventory and changes in current affairs. Fortunately, transactions with merchant guilds continue uninterrupted, allowing the market situation to stabilize somewhat. If transportation in various regions is convenient, it is expected that during the spring sales season, there might be smooth transactions, which could reduce the inventory of over 100,000 bales. However, the prevalence of soldiers and bandits in various provinces prevents people from living in peace, and purchasing power may decrease, which is indeed a hidden concern for the development of the yarn market.</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Stimulated by Actual Sales, Exchange People Bid on Yarn. In the morning opening, panic in the market was triggered by political courtesy issues. Subsequently, the market rebounded as buyers took a stable attitude. Each month's price fell by 2 to 5 cash. In the afternoon, with over 2,000 bales of spot yarn traded on the market, buying sentiment was strong again, and prices for each month rebounded by 3 to 6 cash. Total daily trading volume was 14,055 bales. The closing prices for spot bidding are recorded below: Spot Bidding Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance. May: 1561, up 2, 22,800 bales. February: 1583, up 4, 31,950 bales. June: 155, down 1, 15,600 bales. March: 1568, unchanged, 42,850 bales. July: 1560, up 2, 9,050 bales. April: 1561, unchanged, 34,900 bales.</p>
<p>▲ Sichuan Merchants' Purchases Remain Strong. Spot yarn trading on the market remains brisk, with a total of 2,470 bales traded in spot and futures. Purchases were made by: Sichuan merchants, 955 bales; Tianjin, 390 bales; Inland, 350 bales; Changsha, 110 bales; Jiangxi, 95 bales; Ningbo, 15 bales; Nanyang, 25 bales; Xuzhou, 70 bales; Niuzhuang, 40 bales; Guangdong, 25 bales; Shantou, 45 bales; Hankou, 150 million; Xiamen, 5 bales; Anqing, Yantai, Wuhu, and other merchants, 10 bales each; and fellow merchants, 230 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Temporarily Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>▲ Hidden Dangers of Deteriorating Quality of Chinese Cotton. The cotton market is stable and lacks distinct features. Although overseas markets have slightly improved, the limited demand has prevented further progress. Currently, drastic changes are unlikely because holders are not inclined to make concessions. However, if demand remains weak in March and April, and Indian cotton shipments continue to arrive, while the quality of stored cotton is affected by weather conditions and sellers seek to dispose of it, the market may change. Nevertheless, low inland inventories and limited sources of supply provide considerable support. According to a consumer, Shaanxi cotton prices are already higher than the Omra variety of Indian cotton, and the heavy mixing with moisture results in significant discounts, making it uneconomical. This issue also affects Tonghua cotton. Therefore, importing foreign cotton is more profitable in terms of cost calculation. This observation highlights the deterioration of Chinese cotton quality and the decline in commercial ethics, which hinder the development of the cotton market. The insufficient domestic cotton production also significantly contributes to increased foreign cotton imports. Therefore, improving quality and promoting cotton production are crucial tasks for revitalizing the cotton market.</p>
<p>▲ Futures Cotton Slightly Stabilizes with Overseas Cotton. Exchange Han Standard: In the morning, the continuation of stable overseas news improved market sentiment, with prices rising by 5 fen to 2 cash for each month. In the afternoon, due to sluggish spot sales, the market weakened, with prices falling back by 5 fen to 1 cash for each month. The total daily trading volume was 22,300 dan. The closing prices of Han Standard are recorded below: Han Standard Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance. Closing Prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance. 2: 3510, up 5, 42,400. 5: 3555, up 10, 62,700. 3: 3460, down 10, 64,7000. 6: 3470, down 10, 46,900. 4: 3455, down 10, 68,800. 7: 340, down 5, 26,500. ▲ Spot Cotton Trading is Sluggish. Spot cotton trading is particularly weak, and consumers remain in a wait-and-see attitude. 1,100 bales of Yao cotton arrived at the wharf. Transactions are as follows: Shaanxi Cotton: 37.75, purchased by Sanyou Company, 300 pieces, delivery at wharf. Dongtai Cotton: 36.00, purchased by Chongxin Tongyi Factory, 400 bales, spot delivery to factory. Yao Cotton: 33.00, purchased by Taiwanese merchants, 100 bales, also delivery from warehouse.</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn Rebounds Together</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Resists Short Selling and Firms. Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to favorable news from Liverpool but weakened due to Oloren's selling. It eventually firmed again due to short covering. Futures rose by 4 to 11 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 to 8 points, and spot prices rose by 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 25 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pingul rising by 4 rupees, the forward price rising by 3 rupees, Omra rising by 3 rupees for both near and far terms, and White Rock rising by 2 rupees for both near and far terms.

<h3>A Week's Overview of American Cotton</h3>
<p>▲ After the Organization of the Steering Committee</p>
<p>▲ Has Triggered a Turning Point in Market Prices</p>
<p>A dispatch from New York on the 14th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that the low cotton prices of the previous week prompted more purchases from fellow traders and short covering this week. It is rumored that the Cotton Steering Committee has been elected by the cooperative. After this news spread, market prices rebounded. The election of this committee can be seen as the first step in organizing a company to stabilize the cotton market. The local company, which reportedly holds 300,000 bales of futures previously owned by state cooperatives, has published an article stating that the company's accumulation is not for the purpose of liquidating after price increases. Public sentiment seems to gradually believe that the cooperative has sufficient financial support for the remaining cotton. However, some have sold after price increases. In the coming weeks, the South will convene meetings in many places to promote reducing cotton acreage for this cotton season. The weather this week is slightly favorable for farming. It is also reported that the cotton market is unsettled, with some trading, but most purchases are made by speculators, and most of these purchases are short covering. It is generally expected that government activity will be the main force in the cotton market. In reality, new cotton transactions are mediocre, and cloth transactions are mixed, with limited trading. Recent news confirms the estimate of a significant decrease in global American cotton consumption. The weekend statistics are appended on the left (unit: thousand bales): Previous Week Last Week</p>

<h3>A New Batch of Large and Small Grain Rice Has Arrived</h3>
<p>▲ A Total of Over 90,000 Bags of Rice Have Arrived… Not Yet Unloaded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market had sold out its inventory early. New arrivals had not yet been unloaded, causing a period of tight supply in the market. Later, as the new arrivals were released for sale, the market stabilized somewhat. However, local customers had a strong appetite for the rice. Merchants from inland villages, Ningbo, Taipei, and foreign merchants all inquired about it. The market remained stable. A total of two ships arrived with new goods. The Shanggong Maru docked at Yangzi Warehouse with over 70,000 bags, mainly large and small grain rice. The Baotusi ship arrived with approximately 20,000 bags, which consisted of No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon rice. However, none of the rice had been unloaded yet. It was expected to take some time before the rice on the market became available. The prices were several cents higher, similar to the previous spot prices. No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 14 yuan 35 cents, No. 2 at 14 yuan, small grain at 13 yuan 50 to 45 cents, and large grain at 13 yuan 30 cents, with a total of around 6,000 bags traded. In addition, a future delivery of 8,000 bags of specially selected small grain rice imported on the 20th was offered at 13 yuan 60 cents. There were also over 10,000 bags of future deliveries at slightly better prices. It was reported that the market had lacked arrivals of large and small grain rice for a long time, so these new arrivals were very well received by local customers. Although there were many shipments, they were mostly for delivery settlements, resulting in less than half of the rice being available on the market.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Flour is Reluctantly Lifted by Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tapioca flour market, near-term February and March contracts were weak due to the inactivity of merchant guilds. Outside investors were also quiet. Consequently, the price for February reached a low of 2 taels 6 cash 2 li and a half, and March reached 2 taels 6 cash. The prices for other months also decreased by 7 li and a half or 5 li. However, in subsequent trading sessions, there was considerable short covering, which slightly boosted market sentiment. The opening of the afternoon session was initially calm, but then prices for all months were lifted due to continued short covering. This phenomenon suggests that the market may not be sustainable due to sluggish actual sales. Moreover, the fluctuations in long-term contracts will depend on the weather in the future. Even if outside investors have positive expectations, it is unlikely that prices will rise significantly. As a result, February was up 5 li from the previous day, March was up 5 li, April was up 7 li and a half, May was up 2 li and a half, and June and July were up 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat is Down by 4 Cents Alone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures trading was quite active. The near-term contracts were still negatively affected by expectations of increased deliveries in the future. For the new wheat in June and July, bulls and bears were evenly matched. Inland customers were actively selling due to favorable spring weather, while merchants in the port and some factories showed strong buying interest, resulting in significant fluctuations. The market fluctuated significantly. However, the final price for the current month decreased by 4 cents alone due to long liquidation. March also decreased by 1 cent, April remained unchanged, June increased by 1 cent, and July remained unchanged. Spot trading totaled over 4,000 bags. Due to the small size of the standard, asking prices were average. Specially selected Yaowan wheat was still offered at 5 taels 3 cash 7 fen to 5 taels 3 cash 5 fen. Hankou wheat was priced at 5 taels 1 cash 2 fen, and lower qualities were priced at 5 taels, purchased by Fufeng Shenda.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Fruits, Longan's Official Market Has Opened</h3>
<p>▲ Vermicelli and Dried Goods Markets Remain Stable</p>
<p>Regarding the sample quality dispute between the Longan industry and merchants, it is reported that both parties have made concessions and are awaiting future resolution. The official market opened yesterday. Top-grade longan particles, with pure large sizes, were offered at 34 taels. Lower grades were offered at 32 to 30 taels. Middle grades were offered at around 28 taels. The market for lower grades remained stable due to high inventory, with prices offered at 21.2 to 12.3 taels. The total trading volume was several thousand pieces. Sun-dried longan meat showed a slight upward trend, and ordinary longan meat increased by 5 to 6 cash. Large-sized longan meat has been artificially inflated in price and the speculation has been realized, but sales volume may suffer due to the high price. Recently, shipments of "vermicelli" and "dried goods" have continued to arrive. Merchant companies offered a batch of vermicelli at 21 taels 3 cash, slightly better than before. However, distribution to various markets has not been smooth, with only sporadic transactions. The market price yesterday was 21 taels 5 cash, with a stable trend. Yesterday, a batch of ordinary-grade "black dates" was offered, with approximately 100 bags, which were dry and firm, at a price of 7 taels 2 cash 5 fen. Recently, the price of "Lanhua seeds" has risen again due to higher land prices. The market price has increased by 7 to 8 cash, and the market sales price has increased by 1 tael, showing a strong trend.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Inspection Bureau Schedules Inspection of Export Silk</h3>
<p>▲ Sample Silk Under One Dan Exempt from Inspection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has scheduled to begin inspecting export Chinese silk on March 1. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has notified the Jianghai Customs that Chinese silk shipped to Europe and America must have a certificate from the silk inspection office to be allowed for export. All silk merchants have been notified to comply. However, each silk merchant must first send a sample of the silk brand to Europe for evaluation. No value will be charged for these samples. The inspection office has decided to exempt sample silk under one dan from inspection and has already sent notices to that effect.</p>

<h3>Mrs. Nel Doff, Dutch Female Poet</h3>
<p>— Chen Xuezhao</p>
<p>Society is like a vast and boundless sea of turbid currents; life is but continuing to turn with these turbid currents. Although one may wish to bravely fight against them, in hundreds of years, few have been able to overcome them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nel Doff, a modern Dutch female poet, is a wave breaking against the turbid currents of modern society, a poet who chants the bitterness of reality.</p>
<p>Mrs. Doff is Dutch, born on January 27, 1858. Her father was a police officer, and her mother was a lacemaker. Mrs. Doff had nine siblings in total; she was the third. Because of these family circumstances, Mrs. Doff had to take care of her younger siblings from a very young age, and could not attend school on time. Later, her father left his police job, and their whole family had no choice but to find another way to make a living. The impoverished parents took their nine children to Amsterdam. As a result, her father became a coachman, but his income was not enough to feed and house their nine children, so they had to live in a cellar (the cellar on the lowest level of European houses is usually uninhabited, used only for storing wine and luggage, etc.). The hardship of life at this time was simply indescribable. When there was a flood, the whole cellar was submerged, and when the children woke up in the middle of the night, most of their bodies were already in the water. However, in Mrs. Doff's mind, she did not feel that she was poor. Her view of poverty was:</p>
<p>"Not being able to study the things one does not know according to one's own wishes, such as reading, and not being able to put it into practice because of being overcome by various obstacles, and not being able to get close to beauty, this is true poverty."</p>
<p>She also said, "I am not an idealist, nor am I a priest-like person who aims at education. I mean that my works are all produced from all kinds of hardships. Hardship has tormented me for a full twenty years. After these twenty years of hardship, life has been devastated, so I can feel all the suffering in the world very keenly, such as seeing people around me with various obstacles preventing their development, such as a child who could have studied quietly, but is forced to seek a living because of the problems of life, and cannot properly develop his talents. This, for me, is something I feel with infinite pain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Doff herself is someone who holds this kind of deep pain. In her childhood, she only received a general family education and did not receive education in school. Until she was twenty years old, she only knew the word "Non" ("No") in French, and at twenty-eight, her only companion, her husband, brought her to the Brussels Conservatory (Conservatoire de Bruxelles) and through the "Vision" reading method, she began to get a glimpse of classical literature.</p>
<p>Mrs. Doff said that her love of reading came from her nature: "When I was young, I often read books all night. My passion for reading is greater than love."</p>
<p>As for the history of her engagement in writing, it is best to pay attention to her faithful confession:</p>
<p>"Recalling the novels I wrote when I was young, I did not dare to publish them to anyone. I told George Ekhoud about my writing novels. When I had not fully spoken, he stopped me from saying it, so I put the novel in the drawer. Years later, I finally burned it."</p>
<p>"But a kind of self-expression and desire, which is writing, is always like a homesickness in my mind, and has not left me."</p>
<p>"One winter, I lived in Anvers, and accidentally saw a group of children playing in the street through the window. At this time, I was holding a book in my hand and reading my Vision class. Suddenly, one of the children, looking very embarrassed, was beaten badly. This scene immediately aroused all kinds of memories of my childhood, because my younger brothers were often beaten like this when they were young because they were children from poor families. So at this time, I put down the book, picked up paper and pen, and started writing. I didn't stop until I had finished writing, until a notebook was full. After finishing writing, the feeling of ease in my heart was like avenging the suffering I had suffered as a child. However, this feeling disappeared after a while, and I was attacked by a kind of pain and indescribable sorrow. I can still remember that this was on February 28, 1909, when I lived on the street named Avenue du Sud."</p>
<p>"A few days later, a friend came to visit, and I took the manuscript to ask her opinion. After she read it, she said it was good, but in her opinion, it was not of great value. Then she said that Laurent tailbade would be at her house tomorrow, and I could take the manuscript to ask his opinion. The next day, I went, and started reading my manuscript. Tailbade paid close attention, but I was often forced to stop by a kind of timidity and shame. Whenever I stopped, Tailbade urged me to continue reading, so the whole manuscript was continued. Tailbade held my hand and said with great emotion, "I admire you very much, but you must pay attention, you don't need to change anything, not a single word." That day, I went home very happily, put the manuscript in the drawer, and didn't tell my husband. Months later, Tailbade sent a postcard to ask about the novel, and my husband asked me what was going on, so I explained it. He said that I could give it to Verbaereu to ask his opinion. After Mr. V. read it, he added a few words to the top, "This is poetry." He also said, "It needs to be redone, put some life into it." It was not until years later that I fully understood the meaning of these words of Mr. V. What he said was to modify the rhetoric and replace some sonorous words. Two years later, Madame Octave Maus in Brussels gave my handwritten manuscript to Lugde Poe L, who gave my manuscript to the Fasquelle bookstore in Paris. This bookstore was the first place to publish my book."</p>
<p>Mrs. Nel Doff has written seven novels. Although the form of her works is novelistic, her thoughts are poetic, so she is called a poet.</p>
<p>Her seven novels are, Yours de Famine et de detresse, Contes Faroubes, Knetje, Keetje trattin, Ange Lunelle, Campine, and Elvc.</p>
<p>Among them, there is one named Contes Farouches, published in 1913, but this book is not Mrs. Doff's favorite collection of novels. Her favorite is her first work, Keetje trottin, followed by the most recently published Elve and Yours de famine et de Detesse. She herself said that nothing described in these two books is excessive or exaggerated. Mrs. Doff believes that the imagination of writers is not a complete invention, but is created in their own deepest memories, and their feelings for the real world. This feeling is compassion for the unfortunate.</p>
<p>The book that Mrs. Doff loves is Saint-Simon's eleven-volume "Memoirs" (Memoires), which she has read four times. Sainte-Beuve's "Mondays" (Lundi) is also a book that she loves to read, and she also likes to read Balzac's (Salyac) books. Balzac is simply regarded as God by her. The German Heine (Heine) is her favorite poet. Three years ago, she discovered Goethe (Goethe), and she immediately became a passionate lover of Goethe. She began to read T. M. Carre's "Goethe Fu" and Ludwig's "Goethe Fu." She also read a lot of the books of Diderot, the founder of the French Encyclopedia. She loved to read Rousseau's (J. J. Rousseau) Confessions.</p>
<p>In the "Preface to Romain Rolland" by the modern French critic Steian Zweig, Mrs. Doff was listed among the most famous writers in the world, such as Gorky (Gorki)</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Doff has white hair, and the value of her works is gradually increasing. We hear that China has a lot of literature that sings of blood and tears, and for Mrs. Nel Doff's own experience is a true crystallization of blood and tears, and we can't help but have many feelings. January 5, 1930, Paris</p>

<p>▲ Sincere's New Clothing Department Seeks Designs Sincere's New Clothing Department declares that this department is making every effort to study women's new clothing, so the patterns are novel and are very popular among women. Now, in order to improve further, we are publishing a newspaper to solicit new clothing designs. Those who are selected will receive various prizes, which will be awarded in grades (prizes are displayed in this department on the second floor). In addition, the selected designs will be published in a booklet so that women can refer to them, and so on.</p>
<p>▲ Nantong University's Agricultural Science Experiment with Chilean Fertilizer The Chilean Fertilizer Popularization Association at No. 6 Jiujiang Road declares that this association donated several bags of samples to Nantong University's Agricultural Science Department in the spring of the 18th year, which were applied to chicken-foot cotton fields by fourth-year students majoring in cotton planting as supplementary fertilizer. It was applied twice. The first time was when the cotton was three inches tall and had two pairs of true leaves, about ten catties per mu. The second time was when the cotton was one foot tall and had flower buds, and another ten catties per mu were applied. When applying the fertilizer, mix one part of the fertilizer with five parts of soil, stir evenly, and spread it around the cotton plants, so as not to contaminate the cotton leaves and stems. After each application of fertilizer, there was timely rain within a few days, so the cotton easily absorbed nutrients and grew very well. However, before sowing, ten dans of manure were applied per mu as basal fertilizer. The chicken-foot cotton of this department is divided into eight types: (1) green stem, yellow flower, white heart, smooth seed; (2) green stem, yellow flower, white heart, hairy seed; (3) green stem, yellow flower, red heart; (4) green stem, white flower, white heart; (5) green stem, white flower, red heart; (6) red stem, yellow flower, red heart, smooth seed; (7) red stem, yellow flower, red heart, hairy seed; (8) red stem, white flower, red heart. Among them, green stem, yellow flower, white heart is the best, so this kind of cotton accounts for the majority in the agricultural field. The Chilean fertilizer applied is in this field. This year, the cotton yield is 150 catties of seed cotton per mu on average, while the field without Chilean fertilizer only yields 120 catties of seed cotton. The average cotton yield per mu in Nantong rural areas is only about 40 catties, so the lack of fertilizer is evident. According to the record, green stem, yellow flower, white heart chicken-foot cotton was sown on April 29. After three days, there was timely rain, so the growth was good. It germinated on May 8, budded on June 18, flowered on July 8, spitted cotton on August 5, started picking cotton on September 7, and pulled the roots on November 5. There were 260 cotton bolls, yielding one catty of seed cotton. Each catty of seed cotton yields ten taels of cotton coat and six taels of seeds. The fiber length of the cotton is 25 cm, the coat share is 40%, the seed index is 6.84, and the coat index is 4.56. This is the general situation. Chilean fertilizer, also known as Chilean nitrate, is refined sodium nitrate (Na No3), which is a white crystalline substance that can be dissolved in 1.2 times the amount of water and easily absorbs moisture from the air. It is different from gunpowder niter (i.e., potassium nitrate) and should be noted, and so on.</p>

<h3>The National Geographic Society's Newly Compiled Map of Europe·Xiong·Wan</h3>
<p>The National Geographic Society has recently published a great and amazing map of Europe, the likes of which has never been seen before. The map is annotated in the languages of sixty-four countries, because although the alphabets of the languages of European countries are the same, they have different spellings. In addition, changes in place names also cause inconvenience to travelers. Since the European War, the changes in place names have been numerous. Warsaw, near the Arctic, has been renamed Warszawsa. Reval before the war has now been renamed Pallinn. St. Petersburg was once renamed Petrograd, and now it has been renamed Leningrad. Changes in place names like this are really innumerable.</p>
<p>The reason why the National Geographic Society has undertaken this difficult task and published this great map is to facilitate travelers in Europe. Travelers often encounter difficulties with the names of certain cities and towns. This difficulty is even more obvious in railway stations and ship terminals. Travelers can clearly see the following facts: the spelling of Brussels in Belgium is not Brussels, but Bruxelles. Copenhagen is Kobenbam, Vienna is Wien, and Constantinople is Istanbul. The spellings of the above place names are like this in English, and like that in other languages. For example, if a traveler going to Vienna does not know that Wien (German) is originally Venice (English), it will be terrible, because the place names marked in the railway station are annotated in German. In this way, the map of Europe published by the research society is simply a unique treasure for travelers. Dr. Gilbert Grosvenor, President of the National Geographic Society, said in his conclusion to "Changes in Place Names":</p>
<p>"In Europe," the association has more than 50,000 members, who are scattered all over the place. The association often corresponds with them. For example, if you want to send a letter to Rome or Venice, it seems a bit rude to write Rome or Venice on the envelope. It seems like we wrote Nuova York (New York), Filadelfia (Philadelphia), or Salzeestadt (Salt Lake City) on the envelope, making a joke. Letters to Rome or Venice</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>should be written Roma or Venezia (Venice—Italian) on the envelope. Knowing this, this association started three years ago to search for the place names in Europe that have been changed after the war, and compile them into a map using the spelling of their native languages. Although the place names in the map are strangers to us, the place names in the railway station, wheel terminal, etc., are no different from those recorded in this newly made map. The map of Turkey has already been printed. Now that Turkey has recently adopted a new alphabet as the national language, the entire map will be reprinted. The map of Europe is printed in six colors. The scale is a ratio of one inch to 6,000,000 inches, that is, 94.7 miles to one inch. There are more than 8,000 place names in total.</p>
<h3>Interesting Figures on American Automobiles</h3>
<p>American Automobiles Account for 76% of the World's</p>
<p>According to the American Automobile Magazine, the figures on American automobiles are as follows:</p>
<p>Number of automobiles registered in the United States 26,400,000 vehicles, including passenger cars 23,030,000 vehicles, freight cars 3,370,000 vehicles. Percentage increase in registered number compared to 1928: 8%. Number of automobile registrations worldwide: 34,700,000 vehicles. Percentage of American automobiles in the world: 76%. Number of American rural automobile registrations: 5,800,000 vehicles. American automobile mileage: 660,000 miles. Total mileage of American highways: 3,016,000 miles. Expenditure on highways and city streets in 1929: $2,000,000,000. Number of employees in automobiles and related roads: 4,300,000 people. Gasoline tax: $415,000,000. Total automobile tax: $925,000,000.</p>
<h3>The Dead Climbing the Alps</h3>
<p>An Average of Fifty People Per Year</p>
<p>Losing Their Lives for the Love of Flowers</p>
<p>Geneva News: Alpine climbing is popular among the Swiss people. Many people fall and die. According to recent statistics, an average of 50 people die from falls each year. The number of deaths is only more than the number of incidents, because when climbing mountains, many people use long ropes to connect. If one person falls, the others follow. Also, Swiss people like to go mountain climbing by sled, so there are more deaths in winter. From 1923 to 1925, the number of accidents was 112, and the number of deaths was 138. From 1926 to 1983, the number of accidents increased to 150, and the number of deaths was 185. According to the Swiss, a kind of wild flower, red and lovely, grows on the top of the Alps or on the walls in summer, and many people die from picking flowers.</p>

<h3>Recent National Wealth Surveys of Various Countries in the World</h3>
<p>Published in the American International Statistical Monthly</p>
<p>According to the latest survey of national wealth of various countries in the world published in the American International Statistical Monthly, the figures are as follows: United States: 353; United Kingdom: 80; France: 52; Germany: 40; Japan: 22; Italy: 22; Canada: 22; Belgium: 12.</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the national wealth of the three countries, Japan, Italy, and Canada, is 22,000,000,000 US dollars. In terms of population ratio, Japan has the largest population, so its national wealth should be at the bottom.</p>
<h3>Science Will Be Able to Create Life (Humble)</h3>
<p>▲Dr. Heyl's Statement</p>
<p>New York, January 20th—Dr. Paul R. Heyl, a physicist serving at the Acoustics Laboratory of the Bureau of Standards, stated in a speech here that scientific progress is gradually solving the mystery of life, and soon, life will be able to be created in the laboratory.</p>
<p>This physicist announced that the year 1929 showed more significant progress in the discovery of "the secret of life" than other years. Dr. Heyl said,</p>
<p>"The origin of life is merely physical and chemical action. We will explore its mysteries. We will know the method of creating life, as clearly as we now know the combustion of coal, and we will know how to create and build the foundation of life—protoplasm.</p>
<p>Judging from the scientific achievements of the past two hundred years, I do not believe in anything that is impossible. I believe that current science has reached the point where it is possible to solve the mystery of life. We are already able to artificially manufacture many compounds that act in the body.</p>
<p>Life has no secrets or magic. We may be able to solve its mysteries. The so-called protoplasm is nothing more than a chemical compound. I feel there is no reason why we cannot manufacture it, manufacture its birth and death—no one dares to say that."</p>
