<h3>世界和平與中國</h3>
<p>一國者全世界之一部分也。猶之二人之身。全部分病而不安則此無病之一部分固不能安。反之一部分不安。亦必影響於全部分而共感不安今日之所謂世界和平。得母類是</p>
<p>以今日之國際大勢言。全世界人一致期望之軍縮倫敦會議僅成美英日三國協定而法意間之談判。非特迄無進步。感情且愈不如前德匣近日盛倡修改和約恢復失地之論。奥亦與之深相結納一致主張合併意又表同情於德以示勢力之强大。而其他若德波土波俄芬等種種交涉又復屢見巴爾幹之各小國。則皆熟察各大國形勢。縱橫捭闔力謀結合以自固至歡陸各大國之對美新稅則對俄賤售農品旣激起聨合抵抗之勢然因各國之利害不同主張各異。凡所謂經濟同盟關稅同盟等。又皆不易成爲事實。且在此商業不振之際。工業各國。無一不思攫取市塲以圖向外發展故其惟一結果惟有羣趨於擴張軍備之一途此皆所謂世界和平之危機也再進而窺世界各國之内部。自民族運動獨立之潮流盛行而後各大國殊未有所覺悟。於是繼起奮鬭者益多。此爲民族競爭之危機自歐洲各國政治傾</p>
<p>向獨裁而後。一方棒喝黨勢力日張一方無産黨奮力猛侬此種相反潮流之急進實爲民主政治之危機。自各國經濟困難革命潮流紛起而後歐洲各國政局。動摇不定。政府當局之整理財政。旣無善策救濟失業又無辦法於是國民感覺不快。而反對政府者。更藉題以肆攻擊革命風潮由斯益亟近且流行於中南美而日進不已。此爲世界經濟之危機此三者爲今日世界各國普通之現象。苟遇其一。皆足以阻碍和平之進行者也是故世人之盼望世界和平者。須先盼望各國窮兵黷武之野心家不作。政局能漸安定。整理經濟有辦法人民生活能維持而後和平乃可實現則隨此世界潮流而生存之中國獨能違此例乎盼望世界和平而不先自謀國内和平其可能乎。謀國内和平。而不先消駬戰端。安定政局使人民有生活之路又可能乎。我國人而果欲獲得眞正之和平者。當思以前之所以不和平而力改之斯善矣。</p>

<p>表演共分三組均由梁冠榴任裁判、第一組邱飛海對江道章之單打六比二、與七比五邱勝、第二組邱與江對凌道揚凌憲揚之雙打、六比二、六比一、邱江勝、第三組邱與凌道揚對江與王清和之雙打七比五、六比三、邱凌勝、茲記三組表演情形如下、</p>
<p>第一組單打····邱勝江第一組邱與江之單打表演、精彩略見已足引起觀衆之心怡神往、尤以邱飛海之抽球穏練、得心應手、攔殺神速極盡聲東擊西之妙、備受觀衆之讚美不忘、惜其發球乏力、殊爲美中不足、江道章之發球有勁、攔網亦佳懪惟失球頗多、似非</p>
<p>邱敵、結果爲六比二與七比五、</p>
<p>第二組雙打···邱江勝二凌第二組邱飛海與江道章對凌道揚凌憲揚之雙打、道揚爲網球前輩、旣任中央林區管理局長兼任二大敎課、平日公務旣繁、練習又少球藝已較前遜色、但發球姿勢正確、抽球發球、均勁而有力、觀衆均讚美之、惜其失球過多、故非邱江之敵、第其弟憲揚新近由美歸國、現服務於建設委員會此次首都網球賽、建委員有得錦標之希望、即憲揚之力也、但本日表演、不見佳妙、失球迭出、有動輙得咎之槪、邱江二人則聨絡純熟、緊凑得法、隨意應付、網上之花樣、已覺神妙迭見、惜以二凌之未能得手、致其表演、難臻登峰造極之觀觀衆心理對二凌之敗、殊不介意、蓋勢必然也、比數爲六比二與六比一、</p>
<p>第三組雙打···邱凌勝江王第三組邱與凌道揚對江與王清和之雙打以邱之穏配以凌之猛、以江之勁配以王之平、雙方勢力、頗覺不相上下、故表演最顯精采、全場掌聲不絕、第一盤起賽东王連勝三局、邱凌見形勢吃緊、第四局起即奮力相爭、造成三與四之比、江王仍占優勢、第十局起賴邱氏之技巧多端、致勝有方、乃連勝三局、結果爲七比五、邱凌勝、第二盤起賽雙方球勢難分、相持不决者、歷時甚久、最後邱氏每在網邊輕輕一舉、球向橫面射出江雖善跑、無如離球太遠、更以球藝論、江之球實不如邱、王不如凌、故江王之敗、事非偶然、結果六比三、前後二盤之勝利、　　邱凌、及表演完畢、已日落西山矣、</p>

<p>主席報千告主席潘展、致會　略謂今天上海各界代表在此慶祝十九年國慶、今年的慶祝與禮、無論何人都覺比往年不同、慶祝的熱烈也自然加倍民國成立以來、十九年中可謂没一年没有戰事、以致民不安生、從國民革命軍出師北伐以來、四五年中統一幸可告成、只因軍閥政客不斷叛亂致一平統一局面尙不能眞正做到中央抱和平統一宗旨、深知中國命運、惟有將軍隊實行裁編、民生方可寛裕、建設方可進行所以召開編遣會議、决定種種編遣辦法切實進行而一般野心軍閥、恐失地盤即起叛變桂系軍閥謀反於前唐馮繼之於後今年閻鍚山聨合各派反動份子、結成反動大集團、在北平組織僞政府、可謂反動已極但</p>
<p>各界民衆深知彼輩破壞和平、破壞統一、並未對他們表示一些同情國際間亦然中央俯順民意、忍痛討伐、經蔣總司令曁討逆將士之努力奮鬭、已於國慶日前數天、把反動軍閥剷除了和平統一之局從此可以實現可以貫澈、這是値得我們熱烈慶祝的第一點、從前有許多無稽謡言說東北軍隊靠不住、現在如何呢、張學良是完全服從中央不容反動派出來擾亂、又因中日中俄問、時有交涉發生、故更不願國内再有亂事於是他便毅然决進兵國内、把閻逆鍚山趕回山西、今天報上張學良已就海陸空郓副司令職東北之服從中央、擁護中央、已有事實證明、無稽謡言、不攻自破、和平統一、即可實現、所以今年的國慶實在有無限的希望與快樂、這是値得我們熱烈慶祝的第二點蔣總司令主張和平統一謂反動份子只要他不反動到極點、中央定抱仁慈博大之旨、寬恕其旣往一面並電請國府大赦政治犯、除閻鍚山及共黨等及巨惡大憝外、槪主酌予赦免、另一方面又建議中央、提早召開第四次全國代表大會想把民衆所希望與要求的在會議中求得一適當之解决、各界民衆有所建議儘可盡量供中採擇施行、從此和平之門統一之局定可實現惟眞正之和平統一斷在全國民衆、共負責任一致擁護非單靠中央之努力所能完全達　到所以　我們紀念國慶應該用正當力量、來擁護并促進中央和平統一政策之實現、那末慶祝才有意義的、至全國軍隊、應完全由中央支配然後圭匪共黨可完全　清一切殘餘反動分力、可澈底撲滅末農工商學各界從此均得安生樂業、則農不安於農、工不安於工、商不安於商、學不安於學此點全國民衆、應拿最正當而偉大的力量來促其實現、不要只望中央負責、今天把此一點重要意義報告大家、希望大家努力云云、</p>
<p>演詞紀要大會特請中央委員蔡元培先生蒞會演說、其詞略謂、慶祝國慶、已有十八次了、每次都覺得無慶祝的新意義可言、總是今年望明年、更有慶祝價値等老套語、可是今年却不同、現在軍事可告結束、在軍事　間、一切建設事業、都在停頓軍事結束後、無論政治黨務社會、一切問題、都有詳盡計畫、可以努力進行、但是大家仍須同心協力、注意防範、使戰事不再發生、因爲戰爭是人人都恨的希望從今天起不再有戰事的繼起、一致努力谥建設上的一切事業、一面并澈底把貪官污吏等掃除凈盡、這是我所希望的第一點、也就是今天慶祝重要意義的一點、總理說中國人大家都是貧、只有大貧和小貧、這是因爲我國實業不發達、我們每天說打倒帝國主義、而每天每人所賴以生活的、如電火煤油衣着等東西、差不多者仰給於外人、甚至米和麥大部份也從外國購來、可見中國人莫一個不是貧、救貧的方法、最好是振興實業、提倡國貨、現當金貴銀賤之際、我們正可以自已來製造國貨、一面努力勸導民衆服用國貨、今年各處年成又很好、正可將他力來興辦工業、改良農業如果能夠照此切實做云去、那末金錢不致外溢、實業可以振興、國民經濟從此也可漸裕、這是我們應當努力的第二點、現在無論何人、都希望中國有新的建設、但這是要大家共同來努力、全國民衆都該帮助政府去做、不可單靠中央的努力、提倡國貨、亦應上下一致、全國同心心至普及敎育、不知說了多少年了、但但今仍未做到、現在中央規定識字運動、爲七項基本運動之一、吾人應努力做去、現在更有很好的識字工具、就是注音符號、有此工具、各地土語、也都可用他來記載出來、土耳其把阿拉伯字母改爲拉丁字母（即羅馬字母）因而從前要費兩三年工夫才能寫讀的、現在只要兩三個月、便可會了、假使你們能夠實行應用注音符號、那末也一定可以與土耳其一樣的、收到委速委大的效果、至於高等敎育從前北平方面、較爲發達、現在却又不同、這個原因雖多、但是校長或敎授兼職太多、致精神渙散、不能專心辦理、也是重要原因之一、所幸現在敎育部、已確定大學校長、不能兼職的辦法並且已經實行、將來敎育前途、定有很大希望、其他各機關負責人員、亦應照例專責辦理、能夠這樣、那末明年的國慶、斷不至如從前一樣的虚度、定有很大的價値與希望云云、蔡氏演說畢、由市監委王延松演說、略謂、過去慶祝國慶、實無多大價値、只希來年有更好的進展、我們知道中國猶病人、在過去十八年中、都在呻吟於床褥之間一面帝國主義的侵略、猶人之内症、是不易見到的、一面受軍閥的蹂躝、猶身上之惡瘡、内外夾攻、痛苦可知、不過今年起、惡瘡已除、不至如過往上幾年中、軍閥不斷的此仆彼起、中央諸公、將國事看得很明白、已有對症發業的醫方、但是調養與看護、仍須由我們全體民衆自已負責、那末瘡根可完全拔除、帝國主義的侵略、也可解脫、所以今後吾人應努力於各項建設事業、完全遵照中央預定政策做去、建立一個新中國、那末本年的慶祝國慶、才有意義、再不致如過往之虚有其表、而明年之國慶大會、定可實現、吾人的一切希望、謹以此與各位共勉之云云、</p>

<p>大會職員主席楊清源、紀錄周寒梅、司儀許也夫、招待曹華秋、李永君、張紅薇、姜眞吾、陳銘、丁若川、</p>
<p>主席報告各界代表、各位同志、今天是總理倫敦蒙難卅四週紀念日、現在把總理倫敦蒙難的經過情形、約略而扼要的報告給各位、在一八九四年到一八九五年中日戰事的結果、中國海軍完全失敗、朝鮮被割、旅順大連也失掉、這時人民憤慨已極、因爲過去如鴉片戰爭、英法聨軍等役、都失敗於英法各帝國主義、而此次却失敗於新興的日帝國主義、人民之憤怒、槪可想見、於是總理乘此時機、作熱烈勇壯之推翻滿清的革命運動、但因先前革命運動之失敗、總理已不能逗留國内、於是走日本、但清庭與日本議和後、日政府欲拘革命黨解中國、總理不得已、赴檀香山鼓吹革命、那時許多同志、心灰意懶、所以也没有多大效果、總理遂計劃到美國去、在臨走前一天、遇其師康德黎於道上、藉知康在英之寓所、總理居美四五月、同情革命者寥寥無幾、於是赴英國孰知駐美公使楊子通銜總理深、竟電知駐英公使、令其逮捕、總理抵倫敦後、一日、偶出外散步、遇一廣東人、客地寂寞、倍形親熱、那廣東人就邀總理到他寓所去、總理就在卅四年前的今天蒙難了、那廣東人就是駐英公使的參贊啊、總理被禁後、設法逃避、但戒備甚嚴、無法可施、有一天、總理與該公使館職員可爾閑說、告以土耳其皇慘殺阿美尼亞之故事、可爾大爲感動、總理因乘機告可爾曰、清庭之殺我、固因我作革命運動、但我爲基督敎徒、亦係一大主因、願敎友設法救我、可爾欣諾、總理就致書與其師康德黎、康得函後、即擬發新聞稿登英國各大報、痛斥駐英公使密捕總理之非法、并請英外長瑪凱元竭力營救、交涉結果、清庭之狡計、卒不得售、總理遂出險、總計被拘密室凡十二日、總理脫險後、考察各國政治、研究社會科學、并與歐美各政治家外交家交游、旦夕切磋、孜孜研討、總理就恍然於國家非徒國富民强即可、非將民生問題得一澈底之解决不可、於是三民主義、更形完備周密、博大而精深了、現在清庭業已推翻、民國建立已十餘年、不幸軍閥迭生、共産蠢起、人民生計、困苦已極、現在閻馮軍閥、雖已崩潰、和平統一的希望可以實現、但是仍有二點希望、在座各位代表、各位同志、共同努力的、第一封建軍閥雖已打倒、可是封建思想、仍彌漫全國、我們要肅清軍閥及一切封建勢力、非將封建思想澈底掃除不可、第二、就是打倒帝國主義、我們要曉得帝國主義不打倒、封建勢力是無法肅清的、因爲封建勢力與帝國主義、是有密切的關係、例如五國銀行團借欵袁世凱、日帝國主義借欵三千萬元給段祺瑞等、所以要肅清封建勢力、非打倒帝國主義不可、而打倒帝國主義、亦爲肅清封建勢力、登人民於袵席之上的先决條件、今天紀念總理倫敦蒙難、特地提出這兩點、希望各位代表、各位同志、共同努力、報告完了、</p>
<p>大會口號（一）總理精神不死、（二）總理倫敦蒙難、是爲了中國革命而受禍、（三）總理倫敦蒙難、是促國民革命勢力的雄厚、（四）繼續總理的奮鬥精神、（五）完成總理遺志、（六）解除民衆痛苦、（七）肅清中國共匪、（八）實行三民主義、（九）擁護蔣主席最近主張、（十）中國國民黨萬歲、（十一）中華民國萬歲、</p>

<p>三井洋行謂難成事實日本爲調節民食將倉儲陳米、向海外輸出、先向上海出售、再及南洋爪哇等處、聞日本農林省、已决定將陳米十萬石運滬銷售、已紀各報東京電訊、社會局見報後、以本年秋收豐稔、雖無確切統計、已爲事實、榖貴固使一般民食受損、榖賤亦傷農、因新米俱在農民手中、米價過低、農民勢必無利可圖、以本年人工肥料俱貴、成本當然不小、新米價賤、則全人口百分之七十以上人民生計、必大感艱難、日本旣明知我國豐收、欲將大宗陳米、來滬銷售、其但求出售、不計價格、抱有犧牲之决心可見、商人惟利是圖、有可獲利、自爲之承銷、則本國新米、受其壓迫、價將大落、農民年來經濟艱困、新米不能久儲、損失自不在小、來年耕種、或將减少、並以近來粳米出洋風聲甚囂　上、日人將陳米出售、轉購我好米以去、尤不容不預爲防維、社會局認爲目前日食已充、無待外米接濟、擬請暫禁洋米進口、但應防者爲奸商利用禁令、壟斷居奇、或將進口米糧從關稅政策上、加以抵制、聞已呈報市政府核示矣、國聞社記者、昨以此事關係民食、影響頗大、特往三井洋行探詢、據該行某君面告、謂日政府擬以委托三井運米十萬石、至上海推銷確有此事、惟上海三井行、迄今尙未接到何種通知、惟據此間當局推測、則此事恐難以實行、第一、因中國政府、現時對於外國米麥進口、監督頗嚴、最近如俄國小麥進口、已由財部令知海關查禁、如果大量日米進口、中國米價必被傾軋降跌、則農家必將大受打擊、國府爲維護國内農民生機起見、亦必下令禁查日米進口、此可斷言、第二、日本近來米價雖跌落至每石十五六元、與本埠米價比較、尙高三四元、然運輸需費、推銷需費、且將來米價難保不再跌下、故就米價而言、亦無甚利益、故據此兩種原因、日米不致有大量進口、惟將來農林省或將大批日米、運至南洋方面推銷、則必能成爲事實也云云</p>

<h3>譚組菴幼年軼事</h3>
<p>— 蘭</p>
<p>譚爲閩浙總督譚公之第三子。譚公於光緖十一年六月。欽命爲閩浙總督。時有人奏參浙軍名額半虚。軍政不修。奉旨過浙時。調看浙軍。譚公下令於七月一日大閱家叔伯璵時爲文案。兼閱看諸公子文藝時余讀書詁經精舍。因大閱爲十年難遇之舉。遂乞家督携往參觀。即在此時識組庵。組庵時年十五。較余略幼。雖在大閱時間。砲火震天。組庵談笑自若且賦詩二章遣人呈與譚公。譚公逸興遄飛。亦賦七絕一首余亦有古風一篇詠其事。其後徐由仙霞關八閩省看祖姨。即福州府侯公之夫人又得與組庵相見。時値重陽遂作西湖之游。福州西湖。雖不及杭州西湖擅名天下組庵幼即好談兵。每出入。必携小隊百人自隨。而此項小隊。皆選十六七歲少年充之。故軍容甚壯。余亦少好騎馬。此行由仙霞嶺入閩。所騎桃花豹。爲貴州名馬。而余祖時守台州。亦譚公　屬下。然官塲有統率。而余輩往來略迹忘形。以組庵兄弟爲余叔弟子。遂彼此以世兄稱。是日宛在堂游人甚多。余輩雖據中座舉動轉多拘束。組庵旣創游獵之說。余亦策馬以從。比至南山遂啓圍塲。雖近山兎鹿不多。是日獲鹿一頭。野兎七尾。而所耗之彈藥只聞槍炮之聲。亦可見游戲之豪是日居民聞炮驚恐。欵有異變。甚至有移家入城者。而不知余蜚之爲戲也。次日。祖姨垂問舉以相告。祖姨夫婦恐余久留閩省。以好戲而致罪。即日送余返浙譚公亦因此嚴束少子。無故不得携兵械入市。及癸卯科。組庵以會元入翰林。余亦以丁酉舉人。於是科策名榜末。今者組庵言歸道山。論定蓋棺。而余凄凉人海不知將來之爲龍爲蛇爰述幼年時事聊貲談怲而已。（却酬）</p>
<h3>高郵兩奇僧</h3>
<p>— 青萍</p>
<p>高郵乾明寺。知客僧法空。俗姓楊。人咸呼之曰楊和尙。年逾而立。於十年胶即斷絕烟火食。餓則吃松枝。喝則飲井水。每日不洗面。亦不沐浴。而肌膚潔白。並無一些垢污。誠奇事也也。</p>
<p>據縣屬王家港來客云。該處大王廟。有一僧名智慧。於五歲時。得一奇疾。　經名醫診治。愈後。即不能食五榖。日祗啖舊布二尺以果腹。迄今三十餘年。身體頗傁。與常人無異。惟啖後必飲高梁酒三斤云。</p>
<h3>國貨運動大會開幕花絮錄</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>月之七日。上海市第三屆國貨運動大會。在南京路前市政廳舊址。舉行開幕禮。大槪情形。已載本報。茲將是日所見。雜記如下。</p>
<p>會塲在樓上。簽到簿分置門口。計四本。來賓簽名後。各贈國貨評論。及運動大會特刊各一册。樓梯兩旁。三友實業社將二一二布製成男女服式。裝以木架。直立墻畔。約數十具。大大小小。排成一字。如前清官塲之站班然。煞是好看。臺上懸有絲織總理半身遺象。中設一桌。上　供鮮花兩瓶。爲演說席。左右各設一桌。爲記者席。主席團到市政府秘書丰俞鴻鈞。市黨部委員王延松。社會局局長潘公展。市商會主席王曉籟等四人。均目架眼鏡而佩紅綢徽章。惟王延松不穿馬褂。其他三人均藍袍黑褂。僅王曉籟穿緞鞋。其他三人均係革履。　台口圍以白布。書『上海市第三屆國貨運動大會』十二大字。俞鴻均鈞君致開會詞。詳述歷屆抵制外貨效果薄弱之原委。及提倡國貨應從三方面着想之意志。潘公展君報告籌備經過。謂每年因購外貨。流出金錢。在三萬萬元以上。商人貪賣外貨利厚。揣摩顧客心理。甚至以國貨冒充外貨者。望以後父詔其子。兄勉其弟。購用國貨。　屏棄舶來品。則漏巵旣塞。國家自强。王延松君謂開國貨運動會。如病重不得不吃藥然。並非好事。希望本屆開會後。各界同胞咸深明大義。購用國貨。明年今日。不再開第四屆國貨運動會。王曉籟君演說最簡單。僅謂國貨較外貨便宜而堅固。請諸君注意。聲若洪鐘。聽者動容。工商部訪問局代表壽毅成君演說。主從新國貨着想。以新國人耳目。分發明。推銷。保護。研究四項辦法。勸政府。商界。學者。社會各方面。分工合作。半以美國發明汽車。日本發明人力車。我國發明羊角車爲比例。謂須努力前進。乃能與各國並駕齊驅。張子廉君演說時。謂南京路各商店。推銷外貨者多。三大公司如三座砲台。睚鼎立於中華國産聨合商塲之旁。鄙了發起國産聨合商塲。本抱奮鬥精神。倘事與願違。如果失敗。鄙人一息尙存。始終不懈。當奮鬥到底。願本市咯各國網團體聨合協助一致對敝。中國經濟之受人侵略。達於極點。苟不提倡國貨。力圖補救。則危亡立待。此次國貨運動大會。鑒於士女裝束。競尚歐化。莫不趨向舶來品。故舉辦時裝大會。以引起人人能知中國國貨未始不可以作時裝。用意深遠。望官商合作。必能達到目的。語時慷慨激昻。令人興奮。故掌堀如雷。</p>
<h3>攝取錢塘江潮方法談</h3>
<p>— 鑄</p>
<p>一年一度之浙江潮。年來滬上士女。對之彌增興趣。而愛好攝影者。尤認爲唯一之良好機會也。</p>
<p>攝取江潮之影。較之平常之照片爲難。當基來時。勢若奔馬。瞬息即馳。初學攝影者若不有準備必至束手無策。坐失良機。鄙人於此道略有經騐。敢貢數言。以告觀潮者。</p>
<p>潮線之感光每較平常之風景爲速。因水之反光甚强故光圈須略小。否則水紋即難明晰矣。當潮線遠來之時。鏡頭角直對潮線。用平常快慢即可。但若潮線已横掃鏡頭前時。必須用所用镜箱上極快速率。遠近以撥在最遠之尺寸上爲宜。否則但見水花飛濺。潮之來勢無從表現矣。</p>
<p>潮影之冲洗。亦屬難事。如遇感光不足。或感光過度。全須冲晒者之補救得宜。方能完成一美觀之影片。即攝得極好之影片。亦須冲晒得法。方能將潮水細紋。影片。亦須冲晒得法。方能將潮水細紋。完全顯明。聞本埠屆臣氏藥房内之柯達營業處。現已有西人之俱樂部及大公司數特約該處。由專門技師加工專洗此次『攝潮』之照片。凡国人之欲得完好之成績者。不妨一試也。</p>
<h3>海上銀行之安全設備</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>銀行之設立。所以週轉金融。便利匯兌。保管珍品。提倡儲蓄。一舉而數善具。更與錢莊相輔振興市塲。是故銀行者。實社會之咽喉也。雖然。處茲叔秀之世。人心險詐。已達極點。而此阿堵纍纍。彩紙繽紛之所。最足引起竊盜之覬觎。雖謂辦理縝密周詳。而刦案之發生。猶時有所聞。良可慨也。洎科令時。迺更有鞏固之器出。爲銀行謀安全。而亦儲户之保障。其器維何。即保險庫是。郎有友供職銀行。爲述申江某甲乙兩大銀行。已設置此項保庫。據云縱遇水火盜賊。均可無慮。唯建费特鉅。約需百萬左右。此設置保險庫之一室。裝有抽屜盈千。即所稱保險抽斗。均通以電流。由内達外。庫門尤堅固異常。其下更置機關。尤奇者。庫門啓閉。日有定時。故司庫者。其進出庫中。宜格外注意。否則逾時闔入庫内。則本日不能復出矣。第銀行裝此牢固萬全之保庫。其補助於業務上之發展實非淺鮮。故聞甲行之保險抽斗。業已盡行租出。爲儲户藏儲珍貴物品。而後至者均抱向隅。祗得轉向乙行求爲保管藏貯。此乙行恐不久亦將滿額。至保管鄪聞每户每年爲四元。並當給與鑰匙一個云。</p>

<p>秋風一起，凡人皮膚即感枯燥，大抵都凡貧血所致，皮膚層缺乏脂肪滋養，可用牛乳和硼酸甘油搽之甚效，惟牛乳極易酸敗，不如用無敵牌蝶霜爲便，因蝶霜係乳酷製成，不含碱性，能吸收空氣中之滋養料以潤皮膚，故能免除　裂，并止痛癢·頗有良效，　至於内服補血之劑，則以無敵牌之葡萄汁或葡萄酒爲最宜，婦女及小兒之皮膚，極爲嬌嫩，易爲風日所侵害，故嘗敷粉以資保護，　諸房屋之用油漆，牆垣之用粉飾，必較不油漆與不粉飾者能耐久而常新，亦以保護内容弱質，籍増外表觀瞻，而便洗滌麽垢，抵抗風日其法固甚美善，惟古時面粉，乃燒銅鍚而成，鉛有三種，一白鉛，譯名爲鋅，二日蒼鉛，譯名爲　，三日黑鉛，直譯爲鉛，三者之中，黑鉛最賤，易受酸化，製成鉛粉，遇磁變黑，故有害於虎膚，西洋面粉，都用鋅白，東洋面粉，則用蒼鉛，試以硫酸，即易辨識，不變色者，即無害於皮膚，無敵牌之藍盒粉，即爲鋅白，黃盒粉則加以鉍，細膩熨貼，勝於鉛粉，則由配合得宜，故其優點，足僣東西洋之面粉媲美，洵爲皮膚保護劑中之良品，其用法，宜先敷蝶霜，然後撲粉，則不粘，逈僣凡指俗粉，不可同日語也，</p>
<p>西洋輸入之懐中鏡盒粉，一經用罊，往往無從添配，可以郵寄上海國貨路家庭工業社，托爲配裝，但附郵票三角可矣，若其尺寸爲對徑二英寸者，則該社已有現成製就者發行，名爲『無敵牌配粉』祗售二角，各處百貨商店均有售，外有鋁製小盒，并附綢撲，亦可直接使用，惟如移配於鏡盒中時當將粉盤取出，其空盒尙可作别用也，</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二九一）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹滬涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>翠筠摇了一摇頭道。伊是尋短見死的呀。凡是尋死的人。總是一口氣回不過來。一時自已恨極了。常言道。『好死不如惡活』好端端的爲什麽要尋死。但是到了一個氣極恨極的時候。便水裏也跳得下。火裏也跳得下。要是過後思量。死了也是白死。譬如像我們那種人。死了一百個。也只算五十雙。從前我在章家的時候。也幾番要想尋死。不過我没有蓮香那般性子執。事過境遷。又這樣的忍耐下去了。左詩晨道。這話倒不錯。聽你的幾名話。可抵得一篇自殺論讀。那末爲什麽要尋死呢。翠筠道。你聴我慢慢地的講給你㖸。做伊的那位殷老爺。是一位湖州的富翁。從前我們在並慶里的時候。殷老爺就來走動的了。他是一個長的個子。年紀四十多歲。爲人極其和氣。從來不搭架子的。哈人看得出他是一個富翁呢。到了我嫁的一節。蓮香也嫁了這位殷老爺了。那時要討蓮香的客人。他不止一位殷老爺。還有一位年紀輕的客人。　當然没明殷老爺這般有錢。大家部勸伊嫁殷老爺。因爲他又有錢。又是脾氣好。蓮香自已也說。我這加踏進堂子門。原是抱犧牲主義來的。嫁了有錢的人。可以多得一點身價。那末母親養老之費。和兄弟讀書之資。他們省吃儉用。也可以過日脚了。有造化的。說不定將來還炣以補助他們一點。嫁年紀略大一些的人。原也不在乎此。大家當時也以爲蓮香性子好。殷老爺的性子也好。兩個性子好的人。併在一起。再好是没有的了。自從我嫁了章乙青以後。聽得蓮香嫁了殷老爺。心裏還羡幕伊。想蓮香總算吃了幾年苦。跳出火坑了。誰知後來知道殷老爺家裏。也有一隻雌老虎。就是那位殷太太了。殷太太是余家的女兒。在娘家就有名的是一位把家小姐。嫁了遇來。把殷老爺管束得委嚴。越是管束得嚴。那位殷老爺越喜歡出來白相。據他說。在家裏没有什麽趣味。只得出來走走。也有朋友說。殷老爺和殷太太。不像是夫妻。倒像是娘兒了。在家裏只聽得太太的聲音。老爺簡直一點聲息也没有。大概殷老爺那樣不聲不響的好性子。也是這位太太把他磨鍊成功的呢。人家只知道蓮香性子好。殷老爺脾氣好。却没有想到還有第三者。這第三者的雌老虎。却難　呢。</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>World Peace and China</h3>
<p>A country is a part of the whole world, just like a part of the human body. If the whole is sick and uneasy, then this healthy part cannot be at peace. Conversely, if a part is uneasy, it will inevitably affect the whole and cause common uneasiness. Today's so-called world peace is similar to this.</p>
<p>Speaking of today's international situation, the Disarmament Conference in London, which is unanimously hoped for by people all over the world, has only resulted in an agreement between the United States, Britain, and Japan. The negotiations between France and Italy have not only made no progress but their feelings are getting worse. Germany has recently strongly advocated revising the treaty of Versailles and restoring lost territories. Austria has also closely aligned with it, unanimously advocating unification. Italy has also expressed sympathy with Germany to show its power. Furthermore, various negotiations such as those between Germany and Poland, Turkey and Poland, and Russia and Finland are also frequently seen. The small countries in the Balkans are all closely observing the situation of the major powers, engaging in diplomatic maneuvers to consolidate themselves. The major European countries' responses to the new US tariffs and Russia's dumping of agricultural products have aroused a united resistance, but because the interests of the various countries are different and their views vary, all so-called economic alliances and tariff alliances are not easy to achieve. Moreover, in this period of economic downturn, no industrial country is not thinking of seizing markets to develop outwards, so the only result is the tendency to expand armaments. All of this constitutes a crisis for so-called world peace. Furthermore, looking at the internal affairs of countries around the world, since the rise of the trend of national movements and independence, the major powers have not realized this, and more people have risen up to fight. This is a crisis of national competition. Since the political leanings of European countries have turned towards dictatorship, on the one hand, the power of the party is increasing day by day, and on the other hand, the proletarian party is struggling fiercely. This rapid advance of opposing trends is a crisis of democratic politics. Since various countries have experienced economic difficulties and revolutionary trends, the political situation in European countries is unstable. The government authorities have no good policies to reorganize finances, nor have they been able to solve unemployment. As a result, the people feel unhappy, and those who oppose the government are taking advantage of the situation to attack, and the revolutionary trend is becoming more and more urgent, spreading to Central and South America, and progressing rapidly. This is a crisis of the world economy. These three are common phenomena in countries around the world today. If any one of them is encountered, it will be enough to hinder the progress of peace. Therefore, those who hope for world peace must first hope that the warlike ambitions of the expansionists in various countries will not arise, that the political situation can gradually stabilize, that the reorganization of the economy will be carried out with good methods, and that the people's lives can be maintained. Then peace can be realized. Can China, which survives in this world trend, violate this example alone? Is it possible to hope for world peace without first seeking domestic peace? Is it possible to seek domestic peace without first eliminating wars, stabilizing the political situation, and giving people a way to make a living? If we Chinese truly want to achieve true peace, we should think about why we were not peaceful in the past and strive to change. This is the best thing to do.</p>

However, a suicide note was found, suggesting suicide. The police department was immediately notified to investigate, and personnel were dispatched to search at the homes of relatives and friends and at various hotels. By evening, there was still no trace of him. The suicide note stated that Changli had always been cautious, but he knew that he could not undo what he had done wrong. However, his conscience was clear. He did not want to implicate friends, nor did he want to disgrace Buddhism. He could only die to repay the grace of the Buddha and the support of Secretary-General Huang. He asked his relatives and friends to take care of his family. The three hundred yuan he had would be used for his burial. He felt sad to leave his colleagues after more than a year, but in this society, he did not need this body. He would die smiling, hoping that someone would understand him. He left this to tell them. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>India Strives to Break Away from British Rule</h3>
<p>National Congress Leaders Decide on New Plan</p>
<p>Establish Courts of Arbitration</p>
<p>Bombay - The leaders of the Indian National Congress have decided on a new plan to break away from British rule, which is of great significance and may become the starting point for an important development in the Indian situation. They will follow the example of the Irish Sinn Féin leaders during their struggle for independence, imitating the British official system and establishing the same governing bodies themselves, starting with the judicial authorities. They will establish courts of arbitration and adjudication. If people or businesses have lawsuits and do not seek resolution from these courts, then all of India will sever ties with them in the future. Only Indian lawyers will be allowed to appear in these courts, and numerous well-known lawyers are willing to serve as judges. Other government agencies will also be established one after another, and their expenses will be collected from the entire country in the name of the National Congress.</p>
<p>Simla - The Indian Governor-General issued an order today authorizing provincial governments to confiscate the property of any illegal groups.</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes Spread Widely in Spain</h3>
<p>Workers Demonstrate and Police Arrest Leaders</p>
<p>Government Resolves to Convene Parliament as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Madrid - The Spanish strike wave has now spread to the cities of Logroño and Malaga. In Malaga, 8,000 shipyard workers are on strike, and there have been demonstrations in both cities. Police were dispatched to disperse the demonstrations, leading to conflicts that resulted in several deaths and more than twenty injuries.</p>
<p>Madrid - The King of Spain has signed an order authorizing the National Bank to release cash to maintain the price of the Spanish currency. The Spanish government claims that it is still determined to convene Parliament as soon as possible. Currently, it is necessary to temporarily implement strict measures, such as prohibiting politically motivated strikes and expelling one British and one American journalist who spread inaccurate information, all to prevent the people from being fooled by well-meaning people. However, despite this claim by the government, the strikes are spreading even further today. Iron workers in Malaga have joined the strike, and a general strike has also broken out in Victoria. The police have arrested fifty labor leaders.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Revolutionary Movement</h3>
<p>Revolutionary Army Has Already Reached Campos</p>
<p>Government Issues Mobilization Order for Reserves</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the latest news from Brazil, a serious development is taking place in the capital. It is said that American stores have been looted by rioters. The government claims that it has launched a major offensive on the southern front, but the revolutionary army claims to have advanced to within a few miles of Sao Paulo. Another report also says that the revolutionary army is advancing rapidly and has today occupied the railway junction of Lorina between Sao Paulo, cutting off the government's main force from its headquarters. Its front line has formed an acute angle, breaking through between the government army's two elite brigades. There is talk that President Luis of the United States has resigned, but this could not be confirmed. It is believed that the government army is temporarily taking a defensive position, waiting for the newly summoned reserve troops to be trained before being deployed. Conversely, the revolutionary army benefits from a quick battle, wanting to determine the outcome before the government can mobilize a large army. Currently, food is running short in the capital, and the port has been blockaded by two revolutionary army ships.</p>
<p>Berlin - The Brazilian Embassy here formally denies the rumors that Brazilian President Luis has resigned, that the navy has joined the revolution, and that the Lorina railway junction has been occupied by the revolutionary army. However, a public statement issued by the revolutionary army leaders today claims that the revolutionary army has advanced to Campos, 200 kilometers northeast of the Brazilian capital, and that the northern front has also occupied the states of Maranhão and Ceará. It is estimated that the revolutionary army has occupied nine of Brazil's twenty states. Recent news from the Brazilian government also claims that the government army has advanced to the state of Minas Gerais after repeated victories, having recovered the railway line from the revolutionary army, and that rice and grain will be supplied to the capital on time in the future.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires - The leader of the Brazilian Republican Party has joined the revolutionary movement. If the revolution is successful, the future leader will be Vargas, the governor of Rio Grande do Sul. The police and navy are loyal to the current government. It is reported that there has been a conflict between the forces in Bara and the revolutionary army, with the revolutionary army using artillery to bombard the provincial capital. Postal and telecommunications are being inspected, and operations continue. Although Brazil is not in danger of famine, the current government has set a maximum price for food. The current government has 43,000 troops and 3,000 officers, with 130,000 reserves. Since 1919, the Brazilian army has been trained by French trainers and is generally loyal. The navy is trained by American trainers, and its leanings are quite inconsistent. According to the revolutionary army, the provinces of Xiha and Manaus have been occupied by them.</p>
<p>Montevideo - Revolutionary cavalry and artillery units departed from Santo Amaro do Livramento and went to Castro to participate in the battle. The government has issued a mobilization order to the navy and reserves, with reserves limited to those aged 21 to 30. The president's son was the first to respond to the call. The government claims to have acquired the latest bombers.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro - The Brazilian Navy Department has ordered several merchant ships to be equipped with guns so that they can cooperate with the fleet.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires - The Brazilian revolution claims that all of Brazil except for three provinces is controlled by the revolutionary army. Radio is also under the control of the revolutionary army, so the navy has no power.</p>
<p>New York - According to the news received, the fleet that the Brazilian government relies on the most is also unstable. At least one warship has hoisted a red flag and joined the revolutionary army. The Brazilian embassy in Washington claims that the Brazilian government is capable of suppressing the revolution within the country, and Brazilians in the United States should not easily believe alarming rumors.</p>
<h3>Danish Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>Abolish Army and Navy</p>
<p>Replace with Security Forces</p>
<p>Copenhagen - The Danish Minister of Defense reported to Parliament today on the disarmament plan, which proposes to abolish the army and navy and replace the army with security forces. Their commanders will be called commanders and captains, not generals or colonels.

In this way, the total national defense expenditure can be reduced to 82.7 million kroner.</p>

<p>London - Conservative Party leader Baldwin issued an article yesterday saying that the Conservative Party is based on the opinions expressed at Wednesday's Imperial Conference and will draft its own platform to implement the principle of imperial preference, submitting it to the people for their approval in the next election.

<h3>Japanese Naval Grand Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Navy's special large-scale maneuvers to practice western Pacific defense operations began at 8:00 AM today. The Red Army launched an attack war, led by Lieutenant General Nakamura Ryosho, a naval tactical authority, who led the fleet out of Ise Bay, south into the Pacific Ocean, as far as the South Sea Islands. The Blue Army, that is, the defending army, was commanded by Lieutenant General Yamamoto Eisuke, commander of the combined fleet, and prepared everything at the Wu naval port. At the order, a large fleet was dispatched. All of the Japanese Navy's elite, led by the two commanders, competed in tactics and strategy, from the joint offensive and defensive battles of the air force and submarines to the functions of new weapons, all exerting their abilities to the fullest. It was a landmark large-scale exercise. Once the war machine was skilled, martial law was imposed on the naval ports of Wu, Yokosuka, and Sasebo, as well as the two important ports of Maizuru and Ominato, creating a state of wartime.</p>

<h3>Japanese Hold Local Governors' Conference</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The first day of the Local Governors' Conference, today at 10:00 AM, opened at the Prime Minister's residence in Nagatacho. Government attendees included Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Interior Minister Adachi, Finance Minister Inoue, and other ministers. Local officials included Hokkaido Governor Ikeda, Tokyo Governor Chikai, and the governors of the various prefectures and counties. Chaired by Interior Minister Adachi, the meeting was declared open at the appointed time. First, Prime Minister Hamaguchi gave a speech, as usual, followed by Interior Minister Adachi and Finance Minister Inoue, who each gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tokyo - The first Local Governors' Conference was held yesterday afternoon, discussing matters under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, followed by discussions on matters under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. The agenda was as follows: 1. Expanding the scope of rewards for mayors and village chiefs; 2. Protecting the status of officials; 3. Police mutual aid associations; 4. The unstable state of banks at the end of the year; 5. Enriching bank content; 6. Stabilizing the financial world; 7. Reducing the budget for Showa 6; 8. Independence of judicial police power; 9. Investigating the rural economy.</p>
<h3>German National Bank Raises Discount Rate</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German National Bank today raised the discount rate from 4% to 5%. The banks heard of this and reacted differently, causing the stock exchange to fall in price, with some falling by as much as 20%. The National Bank's increase in interest rates was intended to curb withdrawals. After the National Socialist Party, under the leadership of Hitler, gained an advantage in the elections, the foreign financial community was uneasy, leading to demands for the redemption of short-term loans. It is estimated that at least 30 million pounds have now been withdrawn, and Germans have also converted their bank deposits into foreign currency and stored them abroad for this reason, fearing that Germany will once again experience a currency collapse after the National Socialist Party gains power. However, the Berlin financial community believes that this will never happen, because the banknotes issued by the National Bank have cash and foreign collateral as collateral for more than 54%. Today's increase in interest rates is merely a precautionary measure.</p>
<h3>Britons Pay Respects to Fallen Airship Pilots</h3>
<p>London - The coffins of those killed in the R-101 airship disaster are on display in Westminster Hall for people to pay their respects. A total of 90,000 people came to pay their respects. It was originally planned to close the doors at 10:00 PM, but due to the large number of people, it was delayed until midnight. The crowds were very crowded, so mounted police had to constantly ride through the crowds to avoid traffic jams.</p>
<h3>Russian Authorities Stop Issuing Unemployment Benefits</h3>
<p>Moscow - According to official sources, there is a shortage of industrial workers in Russia, so the Ministry of Labor has ordered the suspension of unemployment benefits.</p>
<h3>France's New Budget</h3>
<p>Paris - The 1931 French budget estimates revenue of 50,251,000,000 francs and expenditures of 50,145,000,000 francs. Although defense spending has increased by 748,000,000 francs, there will be no tax increases, only extra savings from other types of spending.</p>
<h3>Selection of Pennsylvania Governor</h3>
<p>Washington - President Hoover and National Republicans are taking a completely detached attitude toward the intra-party divisions caused by the selection of the Pennsylvania governor this time. The Pennsylvania Republican Party is divided into two factions, one in favor of re-election and one against, on the issue of former Governor Pinchot's continued tenure. On the surface, the excuse is prohibition, but the truth is that Senator Grundy and Van Arsdale are vying for the position. The reason why the National Republican Party is unwilling to intervene is that this is entirely a state-level dispute, and outsiders should not interfere.</p>
<h3>Romanian Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Bucharest - After Romanian agricultural leader Maniu resigned as prime minister, the cabinet has now been reshuffled. Mironescu has been appointed prime minister and concurrently serves as foreign minister. The other cabinet members are the same, so the new cabinet still has the same National Peasant Party flavor.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Falls</h3>
<p>New York - One of the largest brokers on the New York Stock Exchange, Merill Lynch &amp; Co., went bankrupt today. This is the third failure after the fall in the financial market. After this news spread, the stock market fell sharply, with even steel stocks falling by $4.625 to $146.375, the lowest price in two years.</p>
<p>New York - This morning, there was a strong sell-off in the stock exchange, and the value of stocks fell by tens of billions of dollars. All famous stocks, such as US Steel, General Electric, and Standard Oil, also fell to new lows for the year. People were frantic. There has been no such panic since the fall of last autumn. But in the afternoon, the market rebounded, and stocks rose by two to six pounds.</p>
<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<h3>Telegram from Shenyang addressed to All Presidents of Academies, All Ministers, All Committee Chairmen,</h3>
<p>addressed to All Party Headquarters, All Provincial Governments, All Municipal Governments, All Route Commanders-in-Chief, All Army Commanders, All Division and Brigade Commanders, All French Figures, and All Newspaper Offices:</p>
<p>On June 21st, I received an order from the National Government specially appointing Xue Liang as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Upon hearing this order, I am deeply apprehensive and overwhelmed. Xue Liang is of humble talent, and although at the prime of my life, I am ashamed of my superficial learning and limited experience. I have already been entrusted with great responsibility, tasked with defending the border. I have been striving to exert myself, but this highest military position is surely beyond my meager abilities. I have repeatedly expressed my sincere feelings and requested that the appointment be withdrawn, but this has not been approved. Furthermore, prominent figures and elders both at home and abroad have sent numerous telegrams and letters urging me to accept this difficult task. I understand that their affection for me is profound, but they have forgotten my insignificance. If I stubbornly refuse, I would betray their earnest expectations. Only by assessing my own strength can I lift a tripod, lest I cause humiliation. Therefore, I have hesitated to proceed directly, as Xue Liang personally is not worth grieving, but I dare not be careless towards the Party and the nation. Recently, I expressed my proposal for promoting peace through a clever telegram, and I was undeservedly not abandoned by the contemporary world. I have been further urged to take office without delay, and I swore the oath of office in Shenyang today. I will serve the Party and the nation following the Commander-in-Chief, and in addition to reporting to the Central Government, I respectfully send this telegram, hoping you will understand my foolish sincerity and provide guidance.

<p>The people of the two rivers (Henan) have suffered a terrible calamity, with fathers dying and sons perishing, mothers separated and wives scattered, white bones everywhere, and the stench is overwhelming.

Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Gu Yingfen, Song Ziwen, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Jiao Yitang, Liu Luyin, Li Wenfan, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Chen Zhaoying, Kexing'e, Enkebatu, and others, along with staff members from various departments and representatives from various organizations, about six to seven hundred people, attended. After Hu Hanmin, the Chairman, presided and conducted the ceremony,</p>
<h3>National Government's Celebration</h3>
<p>He delivered an opening speech, stating that the National Day of the Republic of China had reached its 18th year. As a result of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's forty years of revolutionary struggle, the autocratic tyranny was overthrown, transforming the nation into a Blue Sky, White Sun, and Crimson Earth, leading all Chinese people towards the path of the Three Principles of the People, becoming a newly constructed nation. What a fortunate occasion this is! Dr. Sun Yat-sen once gave his comrades an exhortation during National Day commemorations in Japan, saying that there is nothing difficult in the world, and those who have the will achieve their goals. It is said that Heaven created these people so that the enlightened should awaken the unenlightened. Therefore, those with foresight should advocate for those who are uninformed, awakening those who are unaware. Military rule is an obstacle to the construction of the Republic of China, and a general class of bureaucrats and politicians, driven by their desire for power, conspire with the warlords, and it is not enough to not completely overthrow them. This is what we comrades should remember and never forget. The title of the Kuomintang is derived from seeking the direct benefit of the nation and the people, and striving and fighting for the doctrine. Over the past decades, the Party has been painstakingly managing, and is fortunately achieving preliminary unification. We are striving for peaceful construction, so that the individual army becomes the army of the country and the people. The ambitious warlords have rebelled against the central government, destroying the unification of peace. Therefore, we had to use military force to remove obstacles. Comrade Chiang commanded the army for five months, enduring hardship and achieving great merit. The remaining evils of the warlords have been completely eradicated and have no strength to struggle anymore. The sacrificing spirit of the armed comrades in the front is so great. The contributions of comrades in the rear to the Party and the country are far from comparable. Comrade Chiang's great spirit is the only successor to Dr. Sun Yat-sen. We comrades should express our respect and congratulations to him, and invite him to give a brief report. (At this time, the entire crowd bowed to Chiang.)</p>
<p>Chiang also returned the salute as customary. Chiang stepped onto the stage amidst thunderous applause and stated that this rebellion of Yan and Feng was a critical juncture in the life and death of the Kuomintang of China and the Republic of China. Fortunately, everyone understood this, followed the orders of the Central Government, vowed to fight, and remained steadfast, eliminating all reactionary forces. This is entirely the result of the victory of the doctrine and the concerted efforts of comrades in the rear. However, sometimes I heard at the front that some people were discussing that the Party branches in various places were becoming bureaucratic, which is extremely distressing. In the future, I hope that the Central and local comrades will work together in accordance with the Party's unique spirit for the doctrine and the necessary construction in order to achieve the goal of the Three Principles of the People, etc. After the speech, slogans were chanted, music was played, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The National Government held a National Day celebration ceremony at 9:30 AM. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Zhang Xueliang (represented by Yang Huancai), Gu Yingfen, Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, Li Wenfan, Wang Boqun, Jiao Yitang, Enkebatu, Chen Zhaoying, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Zhengting, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Nanxian, Lin Xiang, Chen Shaokuan, Gu Zhenglun, Chen Yi, Li Peitian, Tao Xuan, Zai Xiujun, Zhou Wei, Liu Ruiheng, Wei Daoming, Wang Yongbin, Zhang Fengjiu, Chen Changheng, Sun Bowen, Wu Siyu, Cheng Tao, Zheng Hongnian, Gesang Zeren, Lian Shenghai, Zhang Wenhua, Ni Chenyu, and hundreds of other government officials attended. After Chairman Chiang conducted the ceremony, Chiang delivered a speech stating that today is the National Day of the 19th year of the Republic of China, and it is also the anniversary of the victory of the suppression of the rebellion and the elimination of the forces of Yan and Feng. I believe that from today onwards, the foundation of the nation will be further consolidated, and it will be different from the precarious situation in the past. This is something that all comrades and all citizens can celebrate. However, all comrades must work together to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People, so that everything is on the right track and truly achieves the China that Dr. Sun Yat-sen hoped for. Only then can we answer to Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Taking advantage of today's celebration opportunity, I hope that everyone will redouble their efforts and wish everyone good health. As for the military operations, I have a written report, and I will not repeat it today, etc. Next, Hu Hanmin gave a speech, saying that today is National Day, and not only are the staff of all agencies excited and jubilant, but also the people of the whole country are happy, because people broke away from thousands of years of monarchical autocracy and hundreds of years of foreign rule on this day nineteen years ago. This is the day we were liberated from autocracy nineteen years ago. At the beginning of the founding of the Republic of China, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the Republic of China was still like a child and needed someone to protect him from harm from robbers or beasts. However, since the establishment of the Republic of China, rebellions have occurred one after another, from the distant Yuan Shikai and Cao Wu disasters to the recent rebellions of Zhang, Tang, Feng, Yan, etc., all of which are the scourge of infringing on the people and the obstacle to the Party, so that the people cannot live and work in peace. The Kuomintang has eliminated harm for the people. Fortunately, with the efforts of the Party comrades, the rebellions have been successively quelled and the obstacles removed. Then only we can get today's happiness. We know that in other countries, as long as the government is moved, its policies can be implemented. But in China, there are many domineering warlords who have been raised for too long, too big, so they are still changing words. People like Feng and Yan, because their feudal thoughts are too deep, and they have considerable territory, they are almost kings of one place. I think these people, if they were born in the Five Dynasties, would be like Zhu Quanzhong. However, he was not born in the Five Dynasties but was born in the Republic of China today, and he casually took military power to destroy the unity. Some people are very pitiful, thinking that fighting is destroying peace, thinking that if he rebels, let him rebel, why bother to count him? This is really a wrong concept, this is completely not standing on the position of the Party and the country and the interests of the people of the whole country. If compromise with the warlords, living in temporary peace, is fake peace, so it is necessary to completely eliminate the remaining warlords, and then it will be true peace. The chairman has worked hard for half a year to quell the warlords, and the military personnel who are clearly aware can also be accommodated, but for the culprits who have harmed the people, they will no longer be tolerated. This point shows that the government is of the people, just like what Lincoln said was for the people, because if it is not for the people, then</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The National Government can't be called the National Government. Therefore, this crusade against the rebels is also a crusade for the people. At the same time, because the country has discipline, the rebellion must be crusaded. Now that the warlords who have troubled the country have been quelled, this can be told to the people of the whole country, and at the same time, it can be told to the people that from now on, the government will focus on construction with all its strength. I hope that you will learn from Chairman Chiang and the spirit of revolutionary sacrifice of the general armed comrades in the front, recognize the mission and responsibility you bear, and work hard to carry it out. When next year's National Day comes, there will be better achievements to tell the people, etc. After the speech, music was played and the ceremony was completed. Photo taking and refreshments were served and the meeting dispersed.</p>
<p>The capital's all-sector celebration was held at the public sports ground at 10:00 AM, and approximately 30,000 representatives from various party, government, military, police, agricultural, commercial, academic, women's, and other groups, as well as members of the public, attended. The venue inside and outside was filled with party and national flags and slogans. The Capital Garrison Command and the Capital Police Department dispatched infantry, cavalry, patrol teams, and armored car teams to maintain order at the venue. After the flag raising, music playing, and ceremony, Liu Luyin, the representative of the Central Party Headquarters, gave a speech, saying that the National Day of the Republic of China is the result of the sacrifice of many revolutionary martyrs. This day is very precious. In the past eighteen years, China has been constantly plagued by warlords and reactionaries, resulting in the failure to achieve unification. Especially in recent months, due to the rebellion of Yan and Feng, the Party and the country were on the verge of danger. Fortunately, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, with the spirit of the doctrine, annihilated the crowd of villains, and after half a year of hard work, the flames of rebellion were extinguished. From then on, the Party and the country can hope for peace and construction can begin. Therefore, commemorating the date today not only requires us to trace the legacy of the martyrs, but also to express our utmost respect to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for his meritorious service in suppressing the rebellion. In particular, everyone must be of one mind and one heart to create a truly Three Principles of the People's country, so that the National Day will never be erased, etc. Next, Central Committee member Dai Chuanxian gave a speech, saying that since the warlords in the country were rampant, all political, economic, and cultural undertakings have been unable to be built. Now the reactionary forces have been</p>
<h3>The Crowd at the National Day Assembly Venue</h3>
<p>Eliminated, which is a sign that the warlords who betrayed the Party and the country in the past have all failed. In the future, no one will dare to advocate chaos again, and it will also enable the people of the country to have a deep understanding of the victory of the Three Principles of the People. The foundation of construction will then be further consolidated. The Republic of China has been produced for nineteen years, just like a nineteen-year-old youth, who is strong and vigorous, and his future development is still not exhausted. Today, I and my comrades and compatriots shout three times "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live the Three Principles of the People!" At this time, the whole venue cheered and applauded thunderously. Next, Central Committee members Jiao Yitang, Shao Yuanchong, Lai Lian, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Mu Huaxuan, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce, gave speeches one after another. Then they chanted slogans, played music, and the meeting was dismissed. Then they held student exercises: (1) Inspection, (2) Student military parade, (3) Boy Scout parade, (4) Female student exercises, (5) Boy Scout exercises. At 5:00 PM, people from all walks of life held a lantern parade, attended by about 40,000 to 50,000 people. At 6:00 PM, they departed from the public sports ground, passed through Fucheng Bridge, Changfu Street, Sitiao Lane, Zhongshan Road, Guofu Avenue, Beiting Lane, Zhongshan Road, Xinjiekou, Meridian Line, Jewelry Corridor, Fudong Street, Sanshan Street, Embassy Entrance, and East Arch, and ended at Confucius Temple. At 7:00 PM, a entertainment party was still held at the public sports ground, and the audience was crowded. It didn't disperse until 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Foreign guests celebrated National Day. At 11:00 AM, representatives from various countries went to the National Government to celebrate. The National Government had previously sent a platoon of armed infantry guards, fully armed, lined up inside the gate. When the representatives from various countries arrived, they raised their guns to salute. By 11:10 AM, all the representatives from various countries had arrived, including Belgian Minister Warlace, former Belgian Prime Minister Van Devender, aide Guo Luo, Japanese Charge d'Affaires Shigemitsu, First Secretary Moriya, Morishima Goro, Second Secretary Hayashide, Third Secretary Kinouchi, Consul Kamimura, Army Major General Sazo, Lieutenant Colonel Kita, Major Osaki, Navy Captain Kitaoka, Captain Shaoshao, Lieutenant Kuwahara, Dutch Charge d'Affaires Fukutokuhei, Polish Representative Weidengtao, Councilor Guo Leixinowski, Military Attaché Laiqumen, American Consul Oldens, British Councilor Yinggelan, German Counselor Bide, Borongde, and Dutch Consul Helongmen, etc., a total of 24 people. When the representatives arrived at the National Government, they were led into the reception room by officials from the Bureau of Ceremonies. After a brief rest, the Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies led them into the auditorium. The representatives stood in a row from right to left, with the Belgian Ambassador first. The rest of the entourage stood behind the representatives. At this time, the Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies entered to inform the Chairman, who led National Government Committee members Zhu Peide, Sun Ke, the heads of various departments, Wang Chonghui, Song Ziwen, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting, and senior officials of the National Government participating in the celebration to the auditorium at the same time. The Chairman stood in the center, with the National Government Committee members, the heads of various departments, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs standing to the right of the Chairman. The accompanying officials were arranged in eastern and western civil and military rows. The representatives from various countries then bowed to the Chairman and offered their congratulations. After the Chairman returned the salute, he approached the representatives and shook hands with them in order from the right end of the line to the left end. The Chairman, the National Government Committee members, and the heads of various</p>

The representatives of various countries still stood in order and bowed to the Chairman. After the Chairman returned the salute, he immediately left the auditorium with the National Government Committee members, the heads of various departments, and the accompanying officials. The Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies and other officials led the representatives of various countries back to the reception room for refreshments. At 12:00 PM, the representatives bid farewell, and Chiang also left the government with his wife and returned to his residence.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Address to the Nation on National Day</h3>
<p>The People of the Whole Country Must Make Truly Consistent Efforts</p>
<p>The Central Government Must Especially Revitalize Politics After Suppressing the Rebellion</p>
<p>And Implement the Five Urgent National Tasks That Must Be Achieved in the Current Political Situation. The National Newspaper Offices are Transmitting to the Comrades of the Whole Country: Today is the auspicious day of the National Day celebration. All citizens of the country should feel inspired and invigorated, remembering the difficult achievements of the past. While I, Zhongzheng, was commanding the front lines, during the military operations to suppress the rebellion, which are gradually coming to an end, and peace and unity are regaining light, recalling the annihilation of the rebellion, I lamented that since the rise of the military, not only have the officers and soldiers on the front lines suffered hardships and sacrifices, but also the people of the whole country have been ravaged by the rebel army.</p>
<p>Or have tasted the destruction of the bandits, and even the political construction, with the weight of priorities weighing on its implementation, agriculture, commerce and industry are stagnant due to the unstable order. All these painful costs are the losses of the country. Therefore, after this war, the people of the whole country must make truly consistent efforts to consolidate the unity of the country, and the central government, which is responsible for building the country, must especially revitalize politics after the victory of suppressing the rebellion, so that we can comfort the expectations of the whole country. Zhongzheng has been in the front for a long time and has not been able to personally listen to the opinions of my elders and brothers. However, I firmly believe in my heart that this war is the last war in China to establish unity, so the way to ensure this military victory is to work harder. For the sake of what our compatriots feel most urgently and what the country actually needs, I believe that the following five items are really urgent plans: (1) For the suppression of bandits, when the military is progressing in the front, it is also the day when the bandits are the most rampant. Since they echo each other, we are difficult to take care of both. The pain of the village is the worst. Now that the military is pacified, we must take clearing bandits and stabilizing local areas as a matter of urgency. As soon as we return to Beijing, we will be responsible for planning and actively implementing it. On the one hand, we will delineate the area and order each district to be fully responsible, so as to prevent the wind of evasion and evasion. On the other hand, we will still set the entire encirclement and suppression plan, so as to eradicate the roots and prevent the disadvantage of planning this and escaping to the other. It is proposed to set a limit of three months, at most six months, from the date of the end of the military, and order all to be cleared, so as to solve the difficulties of our compatriots, and at the same time, we will strictly implement the Baojia system and conduct a thorough investigation of the population, so that the criminals have nowhere to hide and the people are guaranteed. This is about the public safety of one also. (2) For the reorganization of finance, regarding the establishment of a budget and the implementation of the accounting and auditing system, the decisions are always made at various central meetings, and the implementation is scheduled. In the end, due to the separatist habits of the warlords and the unremoved bad habits of the people, reactionary rebellions have risen one after another, obstacles are repeated, and the delays are caused. Now the country has regained peace and unity. From now on, for finance, not only must we save as much as possible and establish a suitable budget, but also we must all look forward to the effective implementation of the budget, and the national and local expenditures and receipts must be absolutely open to the people of the whole country. In addition, the unification of the currency system to help the chaos of finance, and the abolition of taxes to cultivate the vitality of industry, must also be implemented in the shortest possible time. This is about finance. The second thing is (3) To clarify the bureaucracy, the great malpractice of today's bureaucracy, one is procrastination and inefficiency, and the other is that corruption has not been eliminated. The former is due to the fact that the powers and responsibilities have not been clearly divided, and the latter is due to the fact that the flaws are difficult to remove suddenly. Disappointing the expectations of the people and staining the revolution is more than this. From now on, we must improve the political system, determine political responsibilities, so that the powers and procedures of the agency are clearly defined, without any confusion, and the wind of evasion and evasion can be eliminated. We must also implement a monitoring system, promote the rule of law, report greed and punish them severely, and corruption will be deterred. This is about the bureaucracy. The third thing is (4) For the development of the economy, the politics of a country are closely related to its economy. For several years, China has suffered from the economic aggression of imperialism, and the reactionary forces have risen to harm the people. The people are suffering from displacement, and the households are rarely hidden. The foundation of industry is about to collapse. In order to cultivate the fundamental plan, we should take the development of the economy as a matter of urgency. It is especially appropriate to follow the guidance of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for national construction, absorb foreign capital under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and engage in the development of industry. Only its use is limited to the development of transportation, the rectification of water conservancy, and the development of agriculture and mining, and the three basic industries. It is absolutely not used for other purposes. When the unification is firmly established, there should be a long-term and precise plan. This is the fourth thing about the economy. (5) For the strict implementation of local autonomy, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy on the national construction program and the implementation of local politics is really an eternal essence, and it is the only way to realize true civil rights. The central government has determined the guidelines for political training in advance, and the various ministries of the National Government have also stipulated the implementation procedures. Regarding the strict implementation of autonomy, it has also been repeatedly emphasized, but the actual results often cannot correspond to the predetermined progress. This is not only the disappointment of the Party and the country, but the exercise of political power has not been the actual training, and the true public opinion has no way to exert concrete power. It is also the general cause of all the corrupt forces of warlords, bureaucrats, communists, and politicians to hold our compatriots, coerce our compatriots, and endanger the country. Now the rebel forces have been eliminated, and the strength of the people should be cultivated urgently. Zhongzheng believes that future political facilities should be concentrated on the active promotion of local autonomy, complete its organization, and enrich its foundation. The central government urges the provinces, and the provinces urge the counties and districts, so that political training and early completion, and civil rights can be truly realized. This is also a fundamental plan. On the above five points, either the government is responsible for, or it is necessary for the cooperation of compatriots all over the country. Zhongzheng believes that the current minimum level of politics must be the realization of these five things before it can be declared innocent to the country and thank the martyrs in the ground. Therefore, based on the feelings that have been made for a while, I will roughly state its outline to my compatriots. It is not the agreement of the breathing soil, but a resource for mutual encouragement. Our compatriots should know that the country is the main body of the people. Only when the people feel the sense of prosperity and commonality with the country can those who harm the country be able to show their skills. Only when the people have a correct and clear understanding of the country can politics be brought into the right track. The failure of past political facilities to be sound is due to the repeated rise of reactionary forces. It is also that our compatriots are indifferent to the distinction between right and wrong, abandon their duty to supervise politics, and the obligation to work hard for the country, so that those in charge feel that there is no way to follow the measures, and villains turn to steal fame and instigate chaos. From now on, after the deep and huge pain, we should understand the righteousness of everyone's responsibility. The Republic of China has been established for nineteen years. It has been through many entanglements. To remove the old and bring in the new depends on the strength of the group. May our compatriots all over the country be aware of it.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Inauguration Ceremony: Zhang Qun's Oath-Taking Speech</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Border Defense, was inaugurated on October 9th as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, a position conferred by the National Government. Zhang Yuejun, the Mayor of Shanghai, was dispatched by the National Treasury to oversee the oath-taking ceremony. A transcript of Mayor Zhang's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Today, Deputy Commander Zhang is holding a solemn and grand oath-taking ceremony, shouldering the heavy trust of the Party-State and comforting the hopes of the people. I, representing the Central Government, participate in this grand ceremony with sincere enthusiasm, expressing my most heartfelt respect. I would also like to share my personal thoughts as follows: Recalling the past two years, when Deputy Commander Zhang and other officials of the Northeast, at the time when the National Revolutionary Army had pacified Tianjin and Beijing, resolutely overcame the special circumstances of the Northeast, telegraphed their allegiance, completed the unification, and realized peace, primarily aiming to increase national interests and the people's welfare. Their dedication and perseverance in loving the Party-State and loving the people have long been universally praised and will be prominently recorded in future history, without needing my humble words to extol them. Since unification, the Central Government has also taken peace as the foundation of unification and construction as the key element of nation-building. Upholding the late Premier's instructions, we strive for peaceful unification and begin construction work. The implementation of troop reorganization procedures, the establishment of a timetable for political tutelage, and gradual progress make construction promising. This is a fact commonly seen by the Chinese people. In January of last year, the Central Government, based on the resolutions jointly signed by the commanders-in-chief of various group armies at the Tangshan Meeting in Beiping on August 12th of the previous year, convened a conference on the implementation of reorganization and began to proceed. For a time, an atmosphere of peace and harmony filled the entire country. Not only was the Central Government confident that post-war military affairs could be reorganized from this starting point, but also that new military construction for consolidating national defense could also begin from this point. The people across the country celebrated with joy, believing that the world would be at peace from then on. Unexpectedly, Yan, Feng, and others outwardly complied but inwardly opposed, first engaging in mutual infighting, manipulating the Central Government, each hoping to fulfill their selfish desires. When the Central Government did not listen to their manipulation and their demands were not met, they colluded with each other to resist the government. In recent years, wars have been frequent, the world is in turmoil, and there has been almost no day of peace. All of this is due to this. The Central Government was forced to suppress the rebellion. Counting the past wars, it is always the rebels who act first, and then the Central Government begins to suppress them. Even in the current war, which has lasted for half a year, the direct and indirect losses to the country are incalculable. Just because of the selfish desires of a few individuals, the country and the people have suffered so much. Who with insight would not feel guilty? I remember that when the war first broke out in March of this year, Deputy Commander Zhang was the first to telegraph, striving for peace. However, Yan, Feng, and their ilk showed no awareness, disregarding all sacrifices and daring to act unjustly to fulfill their selfish desires. This is truly a great misfortune in the history of the Republic of China. Deputy Commander Zhang, loving the Party-State and loving the people, could not bear to see the newly built nation disintegrate. Therefore, last month, he again telegraphed, with a heart of compassion, issuing words of persuading for peace, advocating that everything should be handled by the Central Government. This is truly a consistent proposition, and it is the most sincere expression of wholeheartedly supporting the Central Government and maintaining unification. Furthermore, sending troops to Tianjin and Beijing is even more sufficient to promote the realization of his proposition. Look at where the troops go, the people cheer, and all parties respond. The abundance of telegrams also shows the consensus of the people. Success can be predicted. Now, after Deputy Commander Zhang takes office, he can, with the position of Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the country, assist the Central Government and Commander-in-Chief Chiang in establishing the overall situation and handling post-war military affairs, so that the government can calmly build. This is truly a plan for the long-term stability of the country and a great undertaking that will last for generations. May Deputy Commander Zhang and Commander-in-Chief Chiang work together to achieve it. How fortunate, how fortunate!</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Truth of the Tang Surname Tragedy Remains Unclear. The case of the tragic murder of Tang Zhikui, the owner of Tang Helong Store in Kuatang Bridge Street, has been reported in the newspapers for over a month, but the murderer has not been caught. There are rumors that his son, Tang Qiusheng, is highly suspected, but this may not be true. Or, it may be that the murderer hopes to escape the law by spreading rumors. People do not know how the court will handle this bizarre tragic case.</p>
<p>The Water and Land Police Detectives Arrested Bandits and Sent Them to the County. Chief Detective Fei of the First Squad of the First District of the Shanghai Provincial Public Security Team arrested Yu Guixiang and Fang Ruiyun, notorious bandits who had kidnapped in Jiaozhongwan, at Binlang Road in West Shanghai on the 3rd of this month. After being sent to the department for preliminary interrogation, they confessed to kidnapping the three-year-old child of Yin Qiuyun in Jiaodiaowan. In addition, they confessed to robbing Qian Shunfa's family in Wangjiakan of 1,230 silver dollars and robbing Zhu Xinnong's family in Chenjiawan of property in early March. There were more than 30 robbery cases, with four long and short guns hidden at the residence of their accomplices Yao Jinshan and Ni Zaiyun, who are still at large. In addition to purchasing arrest warrants for the remaining bandits, they were sent to the county on the 9th. Chief Detective Yang Tujie of the Joint Military and Police Investigation Office previously cracked down on bandits Wu Lushi, Shen Yin, and San Taoyun and rescued several hostages. All of them have undergone preliminary interrogation in the department. On the 9th, he continued to go to Shanghai to arrest the accomplices Shen Azhao and the female bandit Wang Ada. They were sent back to the county for preliminary interrogation on the same day. They confessed that they were members of the gang of Wang Ziqin, who had already been executed. Recently, they came to Shanghai to avoid the crackdown by the police detectives. They were sent to the county government for interrogation on the 11th with a prepared document.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Actions Approaching False Accusation Resulted in a Strike. Since the death of the former principal, Wu Keqin, of the Xiaoma Bridge Town Elementary School in the Fourth District of this county, the Bureau of Education appointed Ye Qizhen to take over. He arrived at the school and started teaching on the 17th of last month. Before a week had passed, he was met with resentment from the students' families for excessive corporal punishment. One day, because a class bell was lost, Ye claimed that it was stolen by the students. As a result, a group of older students questioned Ye about this claim, which they considered close to a false accusation. Ye, young and hot-tempered, slammed the table in anger and scolded them, which led to a strike that has not yet been resolved. It is reported that the town's autonomous public office and students' families have separately submitted petitions to the Bureau of Education and the Party and government agencies, requesting his removal.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>A Prison Guard Released a Prisoner, and the Case Was Solved on the Spot. Ding Zhang, the chief of the prison guard at the detention center, colluded with Cao Erxiao, a prisoner who was imprisoned for theft, and released Cao on the evening of National Day to go to a bathhouse outside. County Magistrate Chen discovered this and ordered the guards to arrest Zhang and Cao together, put them in shackles, and detain them for handling. Han Yuwen, a prison official, has been ordered to be transferred to Zhenjiang, but his replacement has not yet been found. After this incident occurred, he immediately submitted his resignation the next morning, citing mental confusion and other reasons. County Magistrate Chen approved his request for leave to seek medical treatment. Song Dongchen, a section chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Sang Xijing, a county government staff member, were assigned to act as agents for the vacant positions. They went to take over at 10 a.m.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Appealed for Funding to Maintain the Collapsing Silk Market. Silk sales are sluggish, and the two harvests of silkworms in spring and autumn have been poor, resulting in excessive losses for silk factories, which are about to go bankrupt. There are a total of 106 silk factories in Shanghai, of which 80-90% have already been shut down. There are a total of 48 silk factories in Wuxi, of which more than half have also been shut down. In addition, there are two in Zhenjiang and 23 in Zhejiang Province, which have also announced their closure. Previously, the industries in the two provinces repeatedly held meetings in Shanghai and decided to jointly appeal to the government to issue public bonds worth 10 million yuan for relief. After repeated meetings in Shanghai, the industries in the two provinces decided to organize a "Special Committee for Submitting Requests for Economic Relief", which would consist of 15 members, including 7 from Shanghai, 5 from Wuxi, and 3 from Zhejiang. The industries in the two provinces authorized the committee to have full authority to handle the repayment of the relief funds in the future. The members from Shanghai and Zhejiang have already been selected. Wuxi specially convened a general meeting of all industries yesterday, the 10th, and selected Zhang Zizhen, Cheng Bingruo, Qian Fenghao, Xue Shouxuan, and Yang Yuchu as the five members. They immediately sent a letter to Shanghai. It has been decided to hold the first special committee meeting in Shanghai at 4 p.m. today (the 12th) to discuss in detail how to repay the funds and how the loan will affect the interests of the industry. Once a decision is made, they will take the document to Beijing and submit it separately to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that it be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>The Dispute over Measuring Cloth in the Silk Industry Was Resolved. The Rixin Silk Shop on Beida Street in this county violated the established regulations on measuring cloth the day before yesterday and refused to accept the investigation of the re-measuring staff, resulting in a dispute. The two re-measuring staff, Tao Quansheng and Meng Zhentai, were beaten and injured. Afterwards, the Jinyun Public Office held a meeting to mediate. Tao Quansheng and others proposed three items: "Apology", "Medical Expenses", and "Fine". The mediation did not result in a satisfactory conclusion. At around 5 p.m. on the 9th, the re-measuring staff Tao Quansheng and Meng Zhentai, and the manager of Rixin Silk Shop, Mu Rongqing, reported their injuries to the county one after another. The trial was immediately conducted by the examiner Yu. He instructed the medical examiner Shen to examine and determine that Mu Rongqing had slight injuries in five places, including his knee, waist, and fingers. It was found that Tao Quansheng had a slight injury under his right arm, and Meng Zhentai had a bruise next to his right ear. After the examination, the examiner Yu instructed both parties to return and wait for further investigation and verification. He also instructed them to try to reconcile. Yesterday (the 11th), Jiang Jinghai, Xu Xiangwen, and Qian Baozhi, the directors of the Jinyun Public Office, acted as mediators and persuaded both parties to resolve the matter unconditionally and withdraw the lawsuit from the county. However, the attitudes of both parties were broken and they refused to withdraw the lawsuit. It is not known how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Provincial Police Team Arrived in Cheng County. County Magistrate Li Leng repeatedly requested troops from the Provincial Government to suppress the bandits in the western countryside and to pacify the people. Chairman Ye ordered the Provincial Security Department to send a team of police from the Provincial Police Team stationed in Jurong, with four platoons of soldiers, a machine gun platoon, and a mortar platoon, to arrive in Xi on the 9th. Director Li first sent Inspector Cheng to Xi to negotiate the boat. In the evening, the Flying Cloud steamboat towed eight civilian ships to Gaoqiao. Due to the lack of firewood, the Licheng steamboat sent a fireman. It arrived in Cheng at around 2 a.m. on the 10th and was stationed at the Guanyue Temple on South Street.</p>
<p>The Reason for Canceling the Qualifications of District Chiefs. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs canceled the qualifications of Chen Jingchen (reported by the Public Security Bureau for opium smoking) and Xing Songwen (for counter-revolutionary case), who graduated from the first training institute for district chiefs. It is heard that Jiang Hong is also involved in the Ji Hehua case and has engaged in fraudulent activities in the name of the county government, and his qualifications as a district chief must also be canceled.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The President of the County Court Was Replaced. Dong Banggan, the President of the Nantong County Court, has been ordered by the Ministry of Justice to be transferred to the Ministry. The vacancy will be filled by Jian Kuiyang, a prosecutor from the Jiangbei Branch of the Qingjiangpu High Court, who will come to Tong to take over.</p>
<p>A Committee to Protect Against Land Collapse Must Be Formed. The Nantong Committee to Protect Against Land Collapse, after being discussed and decided by the Party and government meeting, reorganized and appointed Chen Jin and Qian Xiaowu as the chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. The inaugural meeting will be held on the 13th.</p>
<p>The Issue of Converting Educational Expenses Stored in Classical Money into Silver Dollars. A large amount of Nantong educational expenses is stored in classical money with interest. In recent years, the Bureau of Education has been negotiating to convert 1,000 classical money into one yuan, but the issue has not been resolved for a long time. It has now been submitted to the province to request an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>A Bandit Leader's Marriage: The Bride Was Shot. Several bandits suddenly came to Weijiazhuang in Xinghua County the day before yesterday. Zhao Xiaobaizi, the bandit leader, forcibly took a woman from a certain family and held a wedding ceremony in the village. Unexpectedly, the police team stationed in Liuzhuang discovered the situation and joined forces with the business patrol team to launch a fierce attack. They engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits for several hours. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled. The bride was shot and killed. It is said that bandit Zhao was quite unwilling and is now gathering his bandit gang, intending to loot Liuzhuang.</p>
<p>The Grain Merchants Opposed the Expanding Trend of the Inspection Office. The grain stores outside the South Gate of this city previously opposed the establishment of a wheat inspection branch by the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines in You, which charged an inspection fee of one cent for each dan of wheat. The grain stores then rose up in opposition and petitioned the provincial government to abolish it. To this day, because the goal has not yet been achieved, all the grain stores have uniformly stopped measuring grain.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Prosecutor Appealed in the Electricity Theft Case. The Zhenjiang Dazhao Electric Company previously accused Xu Chengzong of stealing electricity. The first instance court convicted him, but the defendant appealed and the case was sent back to the original court. The original presiding judge suddenly declared him not guilty. The plaintiff was dissatisfied and filed an appeal. The procuratorate approved the appeal and stated that the second instance verdict in the Xu Chengzong electricity theft case was not guilty. The handling prosecutor also considered it inappropriate and is now preparing a detailed statement of reasons to file an appeal within the statutory period.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>A Collision Between Two Boats Caused a Disaster. The Qingping and Qingyuan steamers collided yesterday, one from Shan and the other from the west. Ms. Fang, a female passenger, fell into the river and died. A girl surnamed Zhang (nine years old) fell from the awning, bleeding from her head and suffering serious injuries. In addition to being sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment, the body was recovered and prepared for burial. The woman's husband has arrived and is making strict negotiations.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Local Bandits Demand Ransom. Shen Zicai (also known as Shen Sanguan), who lives in Mashenfangdang, about three li north of Xincang Town, is quite wealthy and has long been coveted by bandits. Therefore, Shen had already prepared to deposit all his valuables elsewhere. Five days ago, a bandit boat suddenly arrived and docked at the Hejia Bridge east of the Shen family. They then landed with weapons. Sanguan was not yet asleep at the time and heard the dog barking. Knowing that something was wrong, he ordered his servant to open the back door to investigate. Four bandits took the opportunity to rush in. At this time, Sanguan had hidden in the bedroom of the servant A Jin. The bandits saw them and tied up A Jin as well. They searched wantonly, but found nothing. They only obtained dozens of silver dollars. They then took Sanguan's son, Xiao Er, who was only eleven years old, wrapped him in a quilt, and carried him away. Before leaving, they told Sanguan that they would bring 30,000 yuan for ransom. If the cash was delivered within two or three days, they would only need 12,000 yuan. After speaking, they boarded the boat and sailed away.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Military Police Conducted a Major Search for Reactionaries on the Xinjiang Steamer. The Xinjiang steamer, which travels between Shanghai and Ningbo, arrived in Yong from Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. During the journey, several reactionaries were suddenly discovered among the passengers, distributing reactionary propaganda. This was discovered by the escorting soldiers, who wanted to arrest them, but they had already mixed into the passengers and could not be found. Yesterday morning, the ship arrived at Yongbu. The command headquarters and the Public Security Bureau sent a team of military police to block one of the two pontoons at the Xinjiang Pier, allowing passengers to disembark only from one pontoon and conducting a strict inspection. After an hour and a half, they found nothing. They only found a large bundle of reactionary leaflets in the toilet on the ship. Later, because the command headquarters received a secret report that there might be firearms left by the reactionaries on the ship, they sent another large team of soldiers to search the ship, but still found nothing.</p>

<p>Important Education News</p>
<h3>Pre-Medical and Undergraduate Curricula</h3>
<p>Temporarily Determined by Each School. The Ministry of Education, based on the request from the Education Department of Guangdong Province for instructions on the distribution of pre-medical and undergraduate curricula, the original request stated, "According to the Ministry's order No. 685, medical education is of utmost importance. Students of the University Medical School must have a degree equivalent to that of a middle school graduate before entering the two-year pre-medical program, and then they can enter the undergraduate program. This type of pre-medical program should be offered at the University's College of Science, and the five-year undergraduate program should include one year of internship." The request was submitted to the Vocational School Review Committee, which decided on the establishment of the pre-medical program and replied for consideration. Now, the reply states that the case has been resolved and submitted to the Ministry of Education for instructions on how to distribute the curriculum for the pre-medical program and the five-year undergraduate program. After receiving instructions, further discussions will be held. The Ministry of Education instructed, "The curriculum standards for each course are currently being compiled by the organizing committee for the preparation of curriculum and equipment standards. Before the curriculum standards are promulgated, all course curricula should be temporarily determined by the school itself and submitted to the Ministry for approval."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Appealed to Luo Jialun, President of Tsinghua University, to Stay.</h3>
<p>Luo Persisted in Resigning to Focus on Compiling Historical Materials. The Ministry of Education, based on a telegram from the Tsinghua University School Affairs Committee requesting that President Luo Jialun be retained and not allowed to resign, has telegraphed Shanghai and Han, hoping that President Luo will make an effort and return to the school soon.</p>
<p>Luo Jialun, President of National Tsinghua University, had previously resigned and was persuaded to stay. It is now known that Luo has resubmitted his resignation with great determination and has accepted the invitation of National Wuhan University to serve as a professor of history. Luo said to people before leaving, "I have always been inclined to writing and research. I have always found the responsibility of educational administration to be difficult. My relationship with Tsinghua is coming to an end, and I am very happy in my heart. I sincerely resigned three months ago and was persuaded to stay by the government. The reason why I have not urged the matter since then is that the central government's strength has not reached Tianjin and Beijing. If I repeatedly asked to leave at that time, I was afraid that people would misunderstand and think that I was showing weakness to the central government. Now that the central government agencies in Tianjin and Beijing have been restored, it is appropriate to insist on resigning again at this time. I have been fortunate to be the president of Tsinghua for two years, and with the guidance and assistance of the central government and all parties, I have been able to consolidate its foundation and monthly expenses, so that it is free from the dangers it has suffered in the past, and solve its affiliation problems, placing it in a proper educational system. Twenty-four redundant personnel have been dismissed, and four important buildings, such as the Biology Museum, the Library, and the Meteorological Observatory, have been built. 290,000 yuan has been spent on purchasing books and instruments in two years, and the amount of waste saved is probably not less than this amount. The final accounts are all available and can be reviewed. The school's finances during my tenure are absolutely transparent. I left the school at the end of May this year, but the calculation sheets for March and April have been audited and reported by accountants and the review committee. Currently, Tsinghua has added more than 40 professors and more than 20 lecturers. Combining with the existing professors, it is truly a great event. The level has been raised, and a graduate school has been established. In the future, students who have achieved certain results in research will be selected from the graduate school to study abroad, limited to ten people each year, and the policy of studying abroad in the past will no longer be followed. All of these major plans have been determined. If they can continue to be maintained, I will be satisfied. What I value is the school's policy, not my personal departure. As for the discipline and justice of the national education authorities, it is even more beyond my ability to ask. I have left my position and am now taking the position of professor of history at Wuhan University. This is not surprising, because after resigning as the president of the school, it is the most logical step to become a university professor. I chose Wuhan for no other reason than that it is a remote place with fewer friends, so I have more time to study. I have always been determined to write a modern history of China. I have collected a lot of materials over the years and plan to start by compiling a series of modern Chinese historical materials, because it is difficult to produce scientific historical works without first engaging in the整理 compilation of historical materials. I have now agreed with the Commercial Press to edit a series of modern Chinese historical materials, and I want to publish one or two hundred kinds of careful and reliable historical materials over a considerable period of time before I can start writing modern history.</p>

<h3>School Celebrates National Day</h3>
<p>The National Jinan University Women's Association has been carrying out its duties earnestly. Recently, it promoted a sanitation campaign. Starting from National Day, the girls' dormitory was open for exhibition for two days, taking the lead in the whole school. Each room was clean and beautiful, and the arrangements were different and extremely ingenious. Women are inherently rich in aesthetics, and after being embellished with ingenuity, they are particularly interesting. A comments book was also prepared, and teachers and students such as Hua Yuan and Shen Yizhen, as well as students who visited, left inscriptions such as being a model for male students and a beautiful life, which were mostly complimentary and contained elegant interest. Luo Jun, Ye Yusheng, and other female students of the Women's Association led the reception, which was very thoughtful. On the morning of National Day, from 8 to 9, a grand review of the student army and boy scouts was held. After 9 o'clock, a celebration ceremony was held. During the day, the event was decorated with silk banners, and at night, lanterns were carried, which was extremely lively.</p>
<p>Fudan University, Jiangwan. Fudan University in Jiangwan held a National Day celebration ceremony at the auditorium of the College of Psychology at 9 a.m. on the 10th. More than hundreds of teachers and students attended. Yu Nanqiu, the Dean of the College of Literature, presided over the ceremony, and Zhong Xingxiu, the secretary, was the master of ceremonies. First, the Kuomintang party song was sung, and the ceremony was held. Then, Chairman Yu Nanqiu gave a speech, followed by a lecture by Xie Liuyi, the Director of the Journalism Department and Chairman of the Publishing Committee. Xie gave a sincere speech on the points that China, schools, students, and the nation should improve. Then, Xu Huijun, a senior in the Civil Engineering Department, gave a speech, followed by a speech by Yu Nanqiu, who briefly stated that in order to improve China, schools, students, and the nation, we must start with unity, spirit, hard work, and cooperation. Finally, slogans were shouted and the meeting was adjourned. In the evening, the school's student association and students from the volunteer school participated in the Jiangwan lantern festival.</p>
<h3>The National Day Commemorative Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Grand Celebration</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All sectors of this city, because this anniversary coincides with the suppression of the reactionaries, the eradication of the rebels, and the foundation of peaceful unification, which can be permanently solidified for eternity, doubled the value of the celebration. Therefore, representatives from various agencies and groups such as party, government, military, police, industry, commerce, academia, agriculture, and women formed a Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the National Day in all circles in advance, actively planning various celebration methods. A notice was issued to the entire city to close all businesses for one day, and all public parks were open to the public for viewing. At 5 p.m. on the 9th, the people of the entire city held a lantern parade in various districts, and participation was extremely enthusiastic. At 8 a.m. on the 10th, a flag-raising ceremony was held at the public stadium in the South City, and at 9 a.m., a celebration meeting was held in the City Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Palace, and various recreational performances were held in various districts. The Boy Scouts and police of the entire city also held grand reviews on the 10th, respectively. The details of each event are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Celebration Meeting</p>
<p>The people from all walks of life in this city held a National Day celebration meeting in the City Chamber of Commerce. More than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life attended. The chairman of the presidium, Pan Gongzhan, delivered an opening speech, and Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee, and Mr. Wang Yansong, a member of the Municipal Supervisory Committee, were invited to speak. The autumn was high and the air was crisp, and the wind was gentle and the sun was beautiful. The representatives present were all happy. The details of each event are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hall Arrangement</p>
<p>A colorful archway was built at the gate of the City Chamber of Commerce, with a portrait of the Premier hung on it, and a bamboo cloth banner with the words "Shanghai People's National Day Celebration Meeting" written on it. The sides were full of National Day lanterns, and various National Day slogans were hung on the walls. The county party and national flags were placed at the second gate. The portrait of the Premier and the party and national flags were hung in the center of the platform. Above the front of the platform was hung "Shanghai People's National Day Celebration Meeting". The four walls of the entire venue were covered with National Day slogans, which were dazzling and beautiful.</p>
<p>Meeting Staff</p>
<p>Presidium: Pan Gongzhan, Yang Qingyuan, Yang Youren, Hou Dachun, Yu Hongjun, Xiong Shihui, Li Zheng, Lin Kecong; Records: Zhou Hanmei, Chen Boxiu; Master of Ceremonies: Xu Yefu; Reception: Wu Jiaze, Zhou Hounong, He Yuanming, Mao Yun, Zhang Sheng, Tang Tie, Zhang Yaoming, Zhang Hanyun.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan said in his speech that today, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai are here to celebrate the 19th National Day. Everyone feels that this year's celebration is different from previous years, and the enthusiasm for the celebration is naturally doubled. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there has not been a year without war in the past 19 years, which has led to unrest among the people. Since the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, unification has been successfully achieved in four or five years. However, the situation of peace and unification cannot be truly achieved due to the continuous rebellion of warlords and politicians. The Central Government holds the purpose of peaceful unification and deeply knows that the fate of China can only be achieved by implementing the disarmament of the army and allowing the people to be prosperous and construction to be carried out. Therefore, a disarmament conference was convened to decide on various disarmament methods and earnestly carry them out. However, some ambitious warlords, fearing the loss of their territory, rebelled. The Gui warlords conspired to rebel in the front, and Tang Fulin followed in the back. This year, Yan Xishan united various reactionary elements and formed a large reactionary group, and organized a puppet government in Beiping. It can be said that the reaction is extremely extreme. But,</p>
<p>The people from all walks of life deeply know that they are destroying peace and unity, and have not expressed any sympathy for them. The international community is also the same. The Central Government, in accordance with public opinion, painfully suppressed them. With the efforts of Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the soldiers who fought against the rebellion, the reactionary warlords were eradicated a few days before the National Day. The situation of peaceful unification can be realized and implemented from now on. This is the first point that deserves our enthusiastic celebration. In the past, there were many unfounded rumors that the Northeast Army was unreliable. What about now? Zhang Xueliang completely obeys the Central Government and does not allow the reactionaries to come out to cause trouble. Moreover, because of the frequent negotiations between China and Japan and China and Russia, he does not want any more disturbances in the country. Therefore, he resolutely decided to send troops into the country and drove Yan Xishan back to Shanxi. Today, the newspaper reports that Zhang Xueliang has taken up the post of Deputy Commander of the Navy, Army and Air Force. The Northeast's obedience to the Central Government and its support for the Central Government have been proven by facts. The unfounded rumors have been dispelled without attack. Peaceful unification can be realized. Therefore, this year's National Day is full of infinite hope and happiness. This is the second point that deserves our enthusiastic celebration. Commander-in-Chief Chiang advocates peaceful unification, saying that as long as the reactionary elements do not react to the extreme, the Central Government will definitely embrace the purpose of benevolence and magnanimity and forgive their past. On the one hand, he telegraphed the National Government to pardon political prisoners, except for Yan Xishan and the Communists and other heinous villains, and mainly suggested that they be pardoned. On the other hand, he suggested to the Central Government to convene the Fourth National Congress earlier, hoping to find an appropriate solution to the hopes and demands of the people in the meeting. The people from all walks of life can make suggestions as much as possible for the Central Government to adopt and implement. From now on, the door to peace and the situation of unification can be realized. However, true peace and unification depend on the joint responsibility and unanimous support of the people of the whole country, which cannot be completely achieved by the efforts of the Central Government alone. Therefore, when we commemorate the National Day, we should use proper strength to support and promote the Central Government's policy of peaceful unification. Then the celebration will be meaningful. As for the national army, it should be completely controlled by the Central Government, and then the remaining bandits and communists can be completely eliminated. All remaining reactionary forces can be thoroughly eradicated. From then on, all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia can live and work in peace. If farmers are not at peace with farming, workers are not at peace with working, merchants are not at peace with commerce, and students are not at peace with studying, the people of the whole country should use the most proper and great strength to promote its realization. Do not only hope that the Central Government will be responsible. Today, I will report this important meaning to everyone, hoping that everyone will work hard, etc.</p>
<p>Summary of Speech</p>
<p>The meeting specially invited Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee, to give a speech. His speech briefly stated that the National Day has been celebrated for 18 times. Every time, I feel that there is no new meaning to celebrate. It is always old-fashioned words such as "This year, I hope next year will have more celebratory value." But this year is different. Now the military affairs can be declared over. During the military affairs, all construction projects have been suspended. After the military affairs are over, all political, party, and social issues have detailed plans that can be worked on. However, everyone must still work together and pay attention to prevention to prevent war from happening again, because war is hated by everyone. I hope that from today onwards, there will be no more wars, and we will all work hard on all construction projects, and at the same time, thoroughly sweep away corrupt officials and other things. This is the first point I hope for, and it is also an important meaning of today's celebration. The Premier said that all Chinese people are poor, only big poor and small poor. This is because our country's industry is not developed. We say "Down with imperialism" every day, but the things that everyone relies on for life every day, such as electric lights, kerosene, and clothing, are almost all supplied by foreigners. Even most of the rice and wheat are purchased from foreign countries. It can be seen that no Chinese person is not poor. The best way to save the poor is to revitalize industry and promote domestic goods. Now that gold is expensive and silver is cheap, we can make domestic goods ourselves. On the one hand, we should work hard to persuade the people to use domestic goods. This year, the harvest in various places is very good, and we can use his strength to run industries and improve agriculture. If we can do this in a practical way, then money will not flow out, industry can be revitalized, and the national economy can gradually prosper. This is the second point we should strive for. Now, everyone hopes that China will have new construction, but this requires everyone to work together. The people of the whole country should help the government to do it. We must not rely solely on the efforts of the Central Government. The promotion of domestic goods should also be consistent from top to bottom, and the whole country should be of one mind. It has been said for many years to popularize education, but it has not been done yet. Now the Central Government stipulates that literacy movement is one of the seven basic movements. We should work hard to do it. Now there is an even better literacy tool, which is the phonetic alphabet. With this tool, the dialects of various places can also be recorded with it. Turkey changed the Arabic alphabet to the Latin alphabet (that is, the Roman alphabet), so it used to take two or three years to write and read, but now it only takes two or three months to learn. If you can implement and apply the phonetic alphabet, then you can definitely receive the same fast and great effects as Turkey. As for higher education, Beijing used to be more developed, but now it is different. Although there are many reasons for this, it is also an important reason that principals or professors hold too many positions concurrently, which leads to scattered spirit and inability to concentrate on management. Fortunately, the Ministry of Education has now determined that university presidents cannot hold concurrent positions and has already implemented it. In the future, the future of education will definitely have great hope. Responsible persons of other agencies should also handle affairs on a dedicated basis as usual. If we can do this, then next year's National Day will definitely not be spent in vain as before, and it will definitely have great value and hope, etc. After Cai's speech, Wang Yansong, a member of the Municipal Supervisory Committee, gave a speech, briefly stating that the past celebrations of the National Day were not of great value. I only hope that there will be better progress in the coming year. We know that China is like a sick person, and in the past 18 years, it has been groaning in bed. On the one hand, the aggression of imperialism, like the internal symptoms of the person, is not easy to see. On the one hand, it is ravaged by warlords, like malignant sores on the body. Attacked from inside and outside, the pain is conceivable. However, from this year onwards, the malignant sores have been removed. It will not be like in the past few years, where warlords have been constantly rising and falling. The Central Government officials see the national affairs very clearly and have already prescribed the right medicine. However, recuperation and nursing still need to be the responsibility of our entire people. Then the roots of the sores can be completely removed, and the aggression of imperialism can also be resolved. Therefore, from now on, we should work hard on various construction projects and completely follow the Central Government's predetermined policies to build a new China. Then this year's National Day celebration will be meaningful, and it will no longer be a mere formality as in the past, and next year's National Day celebration will definitely realize all our hopes. I would like to encourage everyone with this, etc.</p>

The people of the whole country have a firm understanding of our party. This stage can be called the initial stage. From the 16th year to today, all party members and armed comrades have worked hard to quell the rebellion under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang. It can be called the preservation period. From then on, the country will be at peace. We should abide by our personal duties as a member of the country, follow the Commander-in-Chief, and develop and promote all economic and social constructions. Then the 19th National Day will not be equal to a formal etiquette.</p>

Because the audience did not need entrance tickets, they felt more crowded, and the grand occasion was beyond expectations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>

<p>Review Situation</p>
<p>At 9 o'clock, the ceremony began. First, the Public Security Brigade performed, commanded by Deputy Captain Zhou Pu. Then, Jiang Shengtao commanded the motorcycle performance.

The team members raised their hands to salute to the sound of military music. After Xiong finished reading, he returned to the stage to speak.</p>
<p>Xiong's Speech</p>
<p>Reviewing officer Xiong Shihui's speech briefly stated that today is the National Day commemoration. Seeing that everyone is sincere and brave and has neat steps, the brothers are very admired. We must know how difficult it was for the Premier to create the Republic of China. Since the 19th year of the Republic of China, wars have followed each other. First, there was Yuan Shikai's imperial system, second, there was Cao Kun's bribery election, third, there was Sun Wu's stealing of the country, and fourth, there was Wang Fengyan's reaction and troublemaking. Now, although the Central Government is using 400,000 troops to fight on the three lines of Pinghan, Pingjin, and Longhai, working hard to defeat the enemy, the reorganized factions who are causing trouble in the rear are still uniting with the bandits and communists, such as Lu Xingbang's rebellion and Zhang Guijun's disturbances in Hunan, which were all caused by the reorganized factions. In addition, bandits are often found in Ganzhou Province in groups of 300 or 500, and reactionary elements are also sabotaging in Shanghai. Therefore, all kinds of responsibilities are still on your shoulders. The revolutionary cause is the same as personal knowledge and experience. If you don't advance, you will retreat. The cause that the martyrs exchanged with their red blood must be preserved by us and must be promoted by us before it can be done. I think that Germany, since its defeat, has had its military strength restricted by various countries, but it has kept the country peaceful and the industry and commerce have continued to develop, all relying on the well-trained civil defense groups. Therefore, what the brothers hope most today is that on the one hand, you will work hard to study, and on the other hand, you must break the conservative habits. This year, the 19th year, is a score of 10 points. Next year, it must be a score of 12 points. Then Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government gave a speech, and the meeting adjourned at 11:30 a.m.</p>

<h3>Zhenru Battles Howard</h3>
<p>—Zhenru Athletes Take the Field to Showcase Their Skills—Unfortunately, They Fail with a Score of One to Two— On a high-spirited, clear, and breezy day, on the green field where athletes showcase their skills, the fervent football spectacle emerged. Zhenru (i.e., Jinan University), making its debut in the Foreign Football Association, dispatched troops and generals, led by coach Wu Huozhang, grandly arrayed at the Yiyuan lawn to compete against Howard in the Foreign Football Association's Class A competition. After a fierce battle with much to see, Zhenru, with its indomitable spirit, strived valiantly. Although the blue-eyed foreigners were strong, there was nothing they could do. The reason for their ultimate failure with a score of one to two was due to insufficient strength and interrupted momentum.</p>
<p>Facing a Formidable Opponent: Zhenru's soldiers are elite and the greatest among the schools of Jiangnan. Their strength is of a high standard compared to the other teams in Class A of the Foreign Football Association. The intense spirit of resistance in the first half was surprising. However, given that Zhenru was making its debut and immediately faced a formidable opponent, suffering defeat, their momentum may gradually decline and be unable to recover. However, Zhenru is not one to drift with the current. Yesterday's failure is the foundation for future success. Athletes of Zhenru, take good care of yourselves and live up to our eager expectations.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Strength of the Two Teams: Zhenru Team: Liang Guanlian, Feng Lianyou, Jiang Shan Jing, Chen Zhenhe, Liang Shutang, Lin Songfa, Chen Bingxiang, Fu Hexuan, Zai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Mei Hongbao. Howard Kees Team: Mills, Spitting, O'Keegan, Martin, Lubin, Sun Gas, Tuo Kalahan, Wei Temadan, Xia Tuo, Mila. Zhenru's players are superior in aerial skills. Everyone inside and outside the field is skilled in this technique. At one point, the forwards and centers even passed to each other with their heads, earning applause from the audience. Compared to the inside and outside, the defensive strength is stronger. The center line advances and retreats quickly, showing great promise. The forwards have little connection. The three in the middle can still call to each other to shoot. Only Zai Linjing has special skills. The others are sometimes good and sometimes bad, making it difficult to judge. Howard's two wings are quite proactive and capable. The center forward is also courageous and fearless. The center line advances too far, often allowing others to take advantage and enter directly. The goalkeeper is tall and strong. Once he has the ball, no one can take it from him. The victory is due to his efforts.</p>
<p>Zhenru's Three Displays of Strength: In the silver whistle of referee Li Te, the two teams began their hunt. Jinan faced the sun, feeling at a disadvantage. They initially suffered an attack, but then Chen Bingxiang on the left wing took the ball and counterattacked, passing it to the right with their heads, catching the opponent off guard and penetrating deep into the area, earning a corner kick. The goalkeeper punched it out. Zai then attacked again, but was also unsuccessful. Chen Bingxiang entered directly from the left and kicked it out of the goal. Three attacks failed.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Repeated Attacks Occupied the Territory: After ten minutes, the enemy's momentum gradually increased. The forwards' footprints were often found in the Zhenru area, forcing them to retreat repeatedly. Once, they even broke through the inner defense line. Center forward Dan suddenly shot, but Liang Guanlian blocked the shot with his body, resolving the danger.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Goalkeeper Was Skilled: Zhenru's central defender Chen Zhenhe guarded all sides, preventing the enemy from appearing. Center forward Zai Linjing led the troops, disrupting the formation. Howard's goalkeeper was exceptionally stubborn. Once he had the ball, three or four people could not move him. He was surrounded three times, but he safely broke through each time, turning danger into safety. The most dangerous time was when center forward Zai entered deep alone, avoided the defenders, and raised his foot to shoot. The goalkeeper bravely threw himself to the ground to block it, stopping his advance. Chen Jiaqiu added a kick, but the goalkeeper pushed the ball behind the goal with both hands. A great opportunity was lost.</p>
<p>Zhenru Almost Suffered an Accident: In the last fifteen minutes of the first half, Zhenru was greatly alarmed. The enemy's five forwards connected quickly and advanced continuously. It was a pity that their shooting skills were not satisfactory. At this time, the efforts of Feng Yunyou and Jiang Shan Jing were very meritorious. In the last eight minutes, Chen Zhenhe committed a foul, but fortunately it was outside the penalty area and was saved by Lin Songfa. Afterward, the enemy surged in. Liang was uneasy behind him and threw the ball too close, almost causing trouble.</p>
<p>Both Sides Were Shocked: At the beginning of the second half, Zhenru suffered greatly. Among them, Dai advanced twice alone, but stopped halfway, and the entire army retreated to the territory to resist. Soon, the forwards went to the enemy like an overwhelming force. Center forward Zai shot in the crowd, but the goalkeeper blocked the shot appropriately, and the danger passed. The enemy also invaded on a large scale. The initial attack on the right suddenly turned to the left. The goalkeeper could not turn around in time. Fortunately, the left wing mishandled the situation and kicked the ball out of the goal.</p>
<p>The Last Five Minutes: Zhenru's Chen Bingxiang sent another pass. Dai and the goalkeeper competed. Zai was exhausted and the ball returned to danger. At 4:15, Zai saw the opponent's interior was empty and took the opportunity to send it far away. Fu Hexuan and Chen Bingxiang advanced together. The goalkeeper rushed out to save it and collided with Fu. Fu kicked quickly. The ball touched the goalkeeper's body and continued to roll forward. Chen Bingxiang chased after it and saw it hit the post and enter the goal. Zhenru opened the scoring, shaking the whole field. Amid the cheers, the enemy's center forward shot and hit the post. The ball bounced back. The left inner Wei Temma took advantage of the situation and kicked it to tie the score. Afterward, there was not much difference in the back-and-forth play, but in the last five minutes, a dramatic change occurred. The enemy used a feint to the east and attack in the west, passing diagonally from the right wing Mila to the left. The left wing kicked it up. The goalkeeper could not turn around in time and watched the goal be lost. After this, Zhenru wanted to recover, but it was already at the end of its strength and could do nothing. As a result, Zhenru lost by a score of one to two.</p>

<h3>The Grand Performance of Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang in Beijing</h3>
<p>—Singles: Qiu Feihai Wins Over Jiang Daozhang 6-2, 7-5—Doubles: Qiu and Jiang Win Over the Two Ling Brothers 6-2, 6-1—</p>
<p>Qiu and Ling Daoyang Win Over Jiang Daozhang and Wang Qinghe 7-5, 6-3. Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang, national tennis players from our country, have excellent skills and are famous throughout the country. The tennis circles in the capital have long admired their names. This time, through the introduction of Liang Guanliu, a veteran tennis player and staff member of the Ministry of Railways, Qiu and Jiang were invited to Beijing by telegram to perform their skills during the National Day holiday and to have friendly matches with the tennis circles in the capital for mutual learning. Qiu and Jiang invited Wei Zexian as a guide and arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 9th. Liang Guanliu and others greeted them at the station and took them to the Ministry of Railways for rest. In the afternoon of the same day, they first performed with Wang Qinghe and Ma Xi, who won the East China Four Tennis Championships, at the ministry's court. A formal performance was held at the Ministry of Railways' court starting at 3:00 PM on National Day afternoon. In order to limit the number of visitors and raise hospitality fees, tickets were sold for 50 cents. The weather was excellent on that day, making it the best opportunity for playing tennis. Since it was also a holiday, people from all walks of life, both male and female, were very enthusiastic and about 200 people attended. Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, and other important figures from the Party and the country also attended. There was a great gathering in front of the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<p>The performance was divided into three groups, all judged by Liang Guanliu. In the first group, Qiu Feihai played singles against Jiang Daozhang and Qiu won 6-2 and 7-5. In the second group, Qiu and Jiang played doubles against Ling Daoyang and Ling Xianyang and Qiu and Jiang won 6-2 and 6-1. In the third group, Qiu and Ling Daoyang played doubles against Jiang and Wang Qinghe and Qiu and Ling won 7-5 and 6-3. The details of the three groups of performances are recorded below.</p>
<p>First Group Singles... Qiu Wins Over Jiang: The slight glimpse of excellence in the first group's singles performance between Qiu and Jiang was enough to arouse the audience's pleasure. In particular, Qiu Feihai's steady and skillful drawing of the ball, handy application, and swift interception, were praised by the audience without forgetting the beauty of creating sound in the east while striking in the west. It is a pity that his serve was weak, which was a blemish. Jiang Daozhang's serve was powerful and his blocking was good, but he lost many balls and did not seem to be Qiu's opponent. The result was 6-2 and 7-5.</p>
<p>Second Group Doubles... Qiu and Jiang Win Over the Two Ling Brothers: In the second group, Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang played doubles against Ling Daoyang and Ling Xianyang. Daoyang is a tennis senior who is now the director of the Central Forestry Administration and teaches two courses. His official duties are busy and he has little time to practice, so his skills are not as good as before, but his serving posture is correct and his drawing and serving are strong and powerful, which the audience praised. It is a pity that he lost too many balls, so he was not the opponent of Qiu and Jiang. His younger brother, Xianyang, recently returned from the United States and is now working for the Construction Committee. In this capital tennis match, the Construction Committee hopes to win the championship, which is due to Xianyang's strength. However, he did not show his best today and lost balls repeatedly, seeming to be in a predicament. Qiu and Jiang, on the other hand, had pure and skilled connection, tight and effective, and coped at will. The patterns on the net were already fascinating. It is a pity that the two Ling brothers failed, making their performance difficult to reach the peak. The audience did not mind the defeat of the two Ling brothers, because it was inevitable. The score was 6-2 and 6-1.</p>
<p>Third Group Doubles... Qiu and Ling Win Over Jiang and Wang: In the third group, Qiu and Ling Daoyang played doubles against Jiang and Wang Qinghe. Qiu's stability combined with Ling's fierceness, and Jiang's strength combined with Wang's balance, made the strength of the two sides seem quite equal, so the performance was the most exciting and the audience applauded non-stop. In the first set, Wang Lian won three games in a row. Qiu and Ling saw the situation was tight and fought hard starting from the fourth game, making the score 3 to 4. Jiang and Wang still had the advantage. Starting from the tenth game, thanks to Qiu's various skills, they won three games in a row and the result was 7-5. Qiu and Ling won. Starting from the second set, the ball situation of both sides was difficult to distinguish and the stalemate lasted for a long time. Finally, Qiu lightly raised his hand at the edge of the net, and the ball shot out to the side. Although Jiang ran well, he was too far away from the ball. In terms of skills, Jiang's ball was not as good as Qiu's and Wang was not as good as Ling, so Jiang and Wang's defeat was not accidental. The result was 6-3. After the victory of the two sets, it was already sunset when Qiu and Ling finished the performance.</p>

The details are copied separately below.</p>

<p>Meeting Staff Chairman: Yang Qingyuan; Recorder: Zhou Hanmei; Master of Ceremonies: Xu Yefu; Reception: Cao Huaqiu, Li Yongjun, Zhang Hongwei, Jiang Zhenwu, Chen Ming, Ding Ruochuan.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Representatives from all walks of life, comrades, today is the 34th anniversary of the Premier's ordeal in London. Now, I will report to you briefly and concisely on the circumstances of the Premier's ordeal in London. As a result of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894 to 1895, the Chinese Navy was completely defeated, Korea was ceded, and Lushun and Dalian were lost. At this time, the people were extremely angry, because in the past, such as the Opium War and the Anglo-French Allied Forces, they had all been defeated by the various British and French imperialisms, but this time they were defeated by the emerging Japanese imperialism. The anger of the people can be imagined. So the Premier took this opportunity to carry out a passionate and courageous revolutionary movement to overthrow the Manchu Qing. But because of the failure of the previous revolutionary movement, the Premier could not stay in the country, so he went to Japan. But after the Qing court negotiated peace with Japan, the Japanese government wanted to detain the revolutionaries and hand them over to China. The Premier had no choice but to go to Honolulu to promote the revolution. At that time, many comrades were discouraged, so it didn't have much effect. The Premier then planned to go to the United States. The day before he left, he met his teacher, Kang De Li, on the road, and learned that Kang was in the UK residence. The Premier stayed in the United States for four or five months, but there were very few sympathizers with the revolution, so he went to the UK. Who knew that the US ambassador Yang Zhitong deeply hated the Premier, and telegraphed the British ambassador, ordering his arrest. After the Premier arrived in London, one day, he went out for a walk and met a Cantonese. Being lonely in a foreign land, he was very warm. The Cantonese invited the Premier to his residence. The Premier suffered the ordeal on this day 34 years ago. That Cantonese was the counselor of the British ambassador. After the Premier was imprisoned, he tried to escape, but the security was tight and there was no way to do it. One day, the Premier told Mr. Kerr, an official of the British Embassy, the story of the Turkish emperor's massacre of the Armenians. Kerr was very moved. The Premier took the opportunity to tell Kerr that the Qing court's killing of me was because I was doing revolutionary movements, but I am a Christian and that is also a major reason. I hope that the church can find a way to save me. Kerr agreed. The Premier then wrote to his teacher, Kang De Li. After receiving the letter, Kang planned to publish a news release in the major British newspapers, condemning the British ambassador's illegal arrest of the Premier, and asked British Foreign Secretary Mackay to do his best to rescue him. As a result of the negotiations, the Qing court's cunning plan was not successful, and the Premier was released from danger. In total, he was detained in a secret room for 12 days. After the Premier escaped danger, he investigated the politics of various countries, studied social science, and interacted with European and American politicians and diplomats, earnestly studying, and the Premier realized that the country could not just be rich and the people strong, but the people's livelihood problem must be thoroughly resolved. So the Three Principles of the People became more complete, comprehensive, broad, and profound. Now the Qing court has been overthrown and the Republic of China has been established for more than ten years. Unfortunately, warlords have emerged one after another, and the communists have risen up, making people's lives extremely difficult. Now the Yan and Feng warlords have collapsed, and the hope of peaceful reunification can be realized. However, there are still two hopes, which I hope all the representatives and comrades present will work together to achieve. First, although the feudal warlords have been defeated, feudal thought still pervades the country. We must eliminate the warlords and all feudal forces, and we must thoroughly eliminate feudal thought. Second, we must overthrow imperialism. We must know that if imperialism is not overthrown, feudal forces cannot be eliminated, because feudal forces have a close relationship with imperialism. For example, the five-nation banking group loaned money to Yuan Shikai, and Japanese imperialism loaned 30 million yuan to Duan Qirui. Therefore, to eliminate feudal forces, imperialism must be overthrown. And the overthrow of imperialism is also a prerequisite for eliminating feudal forces and putting the people on the throne. Today, in commemoration of the Premier's ordeal in London, I specifically put forward these two points, hoping that all representatives and comrades will work together to achieve them. The report is over.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans (1) The Premier's spirit is immortal; (2) The Premier's ordeal in London was to suffer disaster for the Chinese revolution; (3) The Premier's ordeal in London was to promote the strength of the national revolutionary forces; (4) Continue the Premier's fighting spirit; (5) Complete the Premier's will; (6) Relieve the people's suffering; (7) Eliminate the Chinese communists; (8) Implement the Three Principles of the People; (9) Support Chairman Chiang's recent proposals; (10) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (11) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Navy Commemoration The Navy Special Party Department convened a commemorative meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. After the standing committee member Chen Xunyong presided over the ceremony, the chairman reported the main points of commemorating the Premier's ordeal and the efforts we should make. The words were extremely encouraging, and the ceremony ended at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>County Rectification Committee Commemoration The Shanghai County Party Affairs Rectification Committee convened representatives of various county-level agencies yesterday morning and held a commemorative meeting for the Premier's London ordeal in the committee's auditorium. The meeting was presided over by Jiang Yanqiu, Minister of Propaganda for the county. After the ceremony, the chairman gave a report, followed by speeches by Shi She, Director of the County Education Bureau, and Lu Zhe, Minister of the County Organization Department. Finally, slogans were chanted and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>A Large Shipment of Japanese Rice Will Be Sold in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Requests Preventive Measures</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co. Claims It's Unlikely to Happen. Japan, to regulate its food supply, plans to export aged rice from its warehouses overseas. First, it will be sold in Shanghai, and then in Southeast Asia, Java, and other places. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has decided to ship 100,000 *koku* (a unit of volume) of aged rice to Shanghai for sale, as reported in various Tokyo dispatches.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this news, the Social Affairs Bureau noted that this year's autumn harvest has been abundant, though without exact statistics, it is already a fact. High grain prices harm the general public, but low grain prices also hurt farmers. Since the new rice is all in the hands of farmers, excessively low rice prices will inevitably leave them with no profit. This year, the cost of artificial fertilizers has been high, so production costs are naturally not small. Low new rice prices will greatly affect the livelihoods of more than 70% of the population.</p>
<p>Japan, knowing full well that China has an abundant harvest, intends to sell a large amount of aged rice in Shanghai, seeking only to sell and not caring about prices, showing a determination to sacrifice. Merchants seek only profit, and if there is a profit to be made, they will naturally sell it, which will suppress the price of domestic new rice, causing it to fall sharply. Farmers have faced economic hardship in recent years, and they cannot store new rice for long, so the losses will naturally be significant. Next year's planting may be reduced.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are rampant rumors of *japonica* rice being exported abroad, and the Japanese selling aged rice and then buying up our good rice to take away is something that cannot be left unprevented. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the current food supply is sufficient and does not require foreign rice. It plans to temporarily ban the import of foreign rice, but it should be prevented that unscrupulous merchants will use the ban to monopolize and hoard. Alternatively, imported grain can be resisted through tariff policies. It is reported that this has already been reported to the municipal government for review.</p>
<p>A reporter from the *Guowen She* (National News Agency), considering that this matter is related to the people's food supply and has a significant impact, specifically visited Mitsui &amp; Co. for inquiries yesterday. According to a certain gentleman from the company, the Japanese government plans to entrust Mitsui with shipping 100,000 *koku* of rice to Shanghai for sale, which is indeed the case. However, Mitsui Shanghai has not yet received any notification. However, according to the local authorities, it is feared that this matter will be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>First, because the Chinese government currently has very strict supervision of foreign rice and wheat imports. Recently, for example, the import of Russian wheat has been banned by the Ministry of Finance, which has notified the customs. If a large amount of Japanese rice is imported, the price of Chinese rice will inevitably be suppressed and fall, and farmers will be greatly affected. In order to protect the livelihood of domestic farmers, the National Government will certainly issue an order to ban the import of Japanese rice. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Second, although the price of rice in Japan has recently fallen to 15 or 16 yuan per *koku*, it is still 3 or 4 yuan higher compared to the price of rice in Shanghai. However, transportation requires expenses, sales require expenses, and the price of rice in the future cannot be guaranteed not to fall again, so in terms of rice prices, there is not much profit. Therefore, based on these two reasons, a large amount of Japanese rice will not be imported. However, in the future, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry may ship a large batch of Japanese rice to Southeast Asia for sale, which will certainly become a reality.</p>
<h3>Students from the Zhejiang Sericulture School Visit This Institute</h3>
<p>Twenty students from the Sericulture Department of Hangzhou Provincial Sericulture School, including Tan Yiming (sericulture major), Zhu Jieshou (silk reeling major), and Cai Songqing (fifth-year undergraduate), will graduate next summer.

<h3>Five Bandits Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tang Wenzao Composes a Poem</p>
<p>Says Goodbye to Western Detective in English</p>
<p>Requests the Newspaper to Record the Time in Detail</p>
<p>Each Bandit Ate a Hearty Meal. Yang Kuihou, a comprador for the Dutch merchant An Da Bank, was abducted on the night of January 10 this year while visiting Huaxiangrong's residence in Qunyu Lane on Yunnan Road. A number of bandits kidnapped Yang and hid him, demanding a large ransom. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives of the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol Room arrested the bandits, including Wang Caixi from Yangzhou, 28 years old; Lu Weiting from Jiangbei, 28 years old; Chen Deshan, 22 years old; Han Xiaowuzi, 25 years old; and Tang Wenzao (also known as Tao Wenzao and Tao Yinsheng) from Pudong, 24 years old, among others. They were sent to the Special District Local Court, which, after interrogation, sentenced Wang, Lu, Chen, Han, and Tang to death. The sentences were reported to higher authorities for approval and execution.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the term arrived. The patrol room sent the five criminals to the Second Criminal Court of the court. The executing judge, Cheng Shangfeng, came to the court and announced to the five criminals that they were being executed by firing squad today on the orders of higher authorities. He asked if they had any last words or wanted to notify their families.</p>
<p>According to Wang Caixi, he first asked for wine and food before speaking, saying he would not speak without food. Judge Cheng instructed that he would be given wine and food after he spoke, but Wang firmly refused to speak. Lu Weiting, Chen Deshan, and Han Xiaowuzi also had strong attitudes, stating that they had no last words, only requesting wine and food.</p>
<p>Finally, Tang Wenzao stated that today was his last day being shot, and he had many things to say, asking the court clerk and newspaper reporters to record them. He said that when he was arrested, there was a photo taken, which is now with Western detective White in the Patrol Room. He asked that the photo be sent back to the Baoyitang Teahouse in Zhongshi Town, Pudong, and given to his father, Tang Guanjin, to be hung before his spirit tablet, along with a seven-character quatrain and two four-character horizontal inscriptions, which he asked to be written and hung on either side of his photo, so as not to betray the efforts of his parents in raising him, educating him, and having him study since childhood.</p>
<p>The poem reads: "Tang Wenzao was not originally a human, but a celestial immortal descended to the mortal world. Kidnapping and demanding ransom, he was sentenced to death. On National Day, he goes to the Yellow Springs." The phrases read, "Yellow silk, young girl, nephew, pickled mustard, uncle," and so on.</p>
<p>Judge Cheng verified the confession and ordered the bailiffs to extract two yuan from the court's public funds to purchase food and ordered it to be sent to the local court for execution. The five criminals were then taken down by Western constables and, along with the files and photos, were escorted to the Caohejing execution grounds in cars. The local court was notified to appoint Wang Sixian, a prosecutor, as the supervising official. He brought with him court clerk Yu Fumin, coroner Shen Xiqing, police chief Yang Deshan, police officer Chen Xihui, and twelve execution officers, including Gu Hanqing, Yin Daoju, Zhu Wan Yuan, and Xu Guoguang, who took cars to the execution grounds.</p>
<p>At about 11:00 AM, the death row inmates were brought to the grounds. The convicts said that they were dying today, happily coinciding with the National Day celebration, and could not but celebrate. They then requested that the execution be postponed temporarily and that white chicken and white meat be brought quickly. The patrol room staff told them that there were only steamed buns, to which the convicts agreed. They then drank three bottles of *gaoliang* liquor and ate their fill. Then, convict Tang Wenzao spoke in fluent English, saying goodbye to the patrol room staff and requesting that the newspaper reporters publish the time of his execution in the newspaper so that his family would have a basis for making a funeral announcement.</p>
<p>At this point, Prosecutor Wang had already taken his seat with Warden Dong. He ordered that the convicts be brought forward for questioning. Police Chief Yang then directed the execution officers to take them down and execute them by firing squad. After the coroner verified the deaths, the judge ordered the bodies to be collected by the hall and issued a burial permit.</p>
<h3>Car Goes Missing for Three Hours</h3>
<p>Driver Enters House to Collect Fare</p>
<p>Car Suddenly Disappears Upon Exit</p>
<p>Various Patrol Rooms Search Everywhere</p>
<p>Later Found on Hongqiao Road. Around 8:00 PM the previous evening, two customers suddenly arrived at the World Car Company at No. 397-399, the eastern end of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, saying they wanted to rent a car to go to a residence along the road at the intersection of Ximen Road and Route Say Zo, The company's rent room immediately ordered the car driver, local Zhu Qingfa, to drive Chevrolet cab No. 12522 (Municipal No. 4412) to the destination.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the destination, the two people got out of the car one after the other and entered the house. The driver, Zhu Qingfa, also followed them in. The hirer paid the fare of one yuan and six jiao. Unexpectedly, when the driver turned to go out, the car was gone. Helpless, the driver hurried to the Songshan Road Patrol Room to request an investigation. Upon receiving the report, the head of the patrol immediately used the phone to report to all the patrol rooms in the Public Concession and the police stations in the Chinese area to pay attention. It was not until 11:10 PM that it was found by the Jing'an Temple Road Patrol Room near Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, but no one was in the car and there were no other traces.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news, the Songshan Road Patrol Room immediately sent detectives to retrieve the car and wait for a thorough investigation to determine if there were any other circumstances. According to the accounting room of the World Car Company, the two car renters were familiar old customers. As for whether there were other circumstances, it remains to be investigated.</p>
<h3>Woman is Extremely Vicious</h3>
<p>Murders Husband and Strangles Young Son</p>
<p>Elopes with a Bandit Leader and Flees to Shanghai. Zhang Xiao, a woman from Tengxian County, Shandong Province, is lewd and fierce. She is intimate with Han Yiting, a bandit leader in the area. She heartlessly murdered her husband because she wanted to elope. She sold ten *mu* of farmland to raise money, and because her eight-year-old son was a hindrance, she strangled him as well. She eloped to Shanghai and hid in West Xinxiao Street. A few days ago, her father, Zhang Zhulin, had someone lure her to Xiaoximen, where she was arrested by the police and taken to the First Precinct of the Second District and transferred to the local court. The court selected bailiffs Zou Zhendong and Zhao Mingyuan to escort her back to Tengxian County Court for handling.</p>
<h3>Li Minshou Goes Missing</h3>
<p>Fate Unknown, Reasons Unclear. Li Pengshou, a Guangdong native and assistant commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, was appointed as assistant commissioner of the Yuehai Customs after returning from studying in the United States. His younger brother, Li Minshou, 19 years old, graduated from the Wusong Maritime School and lived at No. 6 Rulin Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Recently, Yang Mingxin, a director of foreign customs, recommended him to work on a ship. Unexpectedly, Minshou suddenly sent a letter to Yang, saying that he was not feeling well and wanted to choose a hospital to recuperate and did not have time to work. After that, Minshou suddenly disappeared around 4:00 PM on the day after Double Ten. His family members saw that he did not return that night and went out to search for him among relatives and friends and in various hospitals the next day, but there was no trace of him.</p>
<p>Minshou was young and handsome and had not yet been engaged. It is suspected that he was frustrated in love and had an accident. His family members also speculated uncertainly, fearing that he might have committed suicide by jumping into the river. Therefore, yesterday they sent someone to report to the water police station, describing his appearance and clothing, requesting attention, and submitting a photo. In the photo, several foreign girls and Minshou are smiling. It is reported that when Minshou disappeared, he was wearing a dark blue serge suit.</p>
<h3>East Ditch Chrysanthemum Exhibition</h3>
<p>Dates: November 1st to 3rd</p>
<p>Location: East Ditch Municipal Garden in Pudong. The East Ditch Garden in Pudong, managed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has been established for three years and has spared no effort in cultivating flowers and propagating seedlings. Special attention has been paid to chrysanthemum cultivation, and research and cultivation have been quite unique. In November last year, a chrysanthemum exhibition was held, which was attended by many citizens. It is now reported that the second chrysanthemum exhibition is scheduled to be held from November 1st to 3rd. In addition to the more than 300 varieties of chrysanthemums already in the garden, totaling about 5,000 to 6,000 pots, fine varieties from public and private gardens in the city will also be collected and displayed. A grand dinner party was held earlier, hosted by Pan Hongding, a municipal committee member of the Gao Hang District, who selected famous chefs to prepare the dishes. It is also reported that the Public Utilities Bureau will reduce fees and add ferry services during the exhibition period to facilitate travel, so there will certainly be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Tidal Bore Viewing on National Day</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was operating its last special train for viewing the tidal bore in Haining the day before yesterday (the 10th). Coinciding with National Day, all agencies and organizations in the city were on holiday, so passengers were even more crowded than on the first and second days. The Railway Bureau's Traffic Department, in view of the increase in tourists, specially ordered the rolling stock section to add carriages, totaling sixteen, still using large double locomotives. The number of Chinese and Western tourists, railway staff, police, and inspectors totaled 680.</p>
<p>The special train departed from the North Station at 6:15 AM. Between Songjiang and Fengjing, it passed over the 31st, 3rd, and 4th bridges, where the double locomotives were still separated and crossed the bridges separately before being reconnected and towed. It arrived at the station at 9:20 AM. Everyone got off the train and, under the guidance of the railway police, transferred to small boats to cross to the tidal bore viewing location. There were police along the way to take care of the tourists. Tourists entered the arena and took their seats. Tea servants provided tea and snacks for lunch and after a short rest. At about 1:00 PM, a horizontal line suddenly appeared on the water surface, which was as smooth as a mirror, rolling in. It gradually turned white, like a snow chain. At first, it rumbled like thunder, then murmured like ten thousand horses galloping. Another line rolled in from the left end, colliding and merging into one, as high as a wall, about five or six feet, sweeping across the bank. The waves rippled, reaching seven or eight feet. The sound of the surge went from loud to soft, like a board rushing away into the distance. The audience exclaimed, "It is a spectacular sight!" Then they packed up their luggage and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Sun Kuibai's Family Suffers Theft</h3>
<p>Male and Female Servants are Suspected. Sun Kuibai, director of the Zhenjiang Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, resides at No. 502 Bazilu in this city. Recently, he traveled to Hangzhou with his family on business, leaving only his male servant, Wang Heming from Beijing, and a female servant to watch over the residence.</p>
<p>Around 10:00 PM on the 9th of this month, Wang suddenly reported to Gao Fusheng, a night watchman near the residence, that the lock on his master's mansion had been damaged and it seemed that a burglar had broken in. Upon receiving the report, he went over the wall through a neighboring drying platform to inspect the lock on the gate, which was slightly damaged but not by a thief. The female servant had been out and had not returned since the afternoon of that day, which was very suspicious.</p>
<p>He reported to the Hongkou Patrol Room, and the head of the patrol ordered Chinese detective Bao Shuji to investigate the matter and determine if there had been a theft. As the owner had not returned, it was not possible to ascertain the situation. When Wang Heming was questioned, he was evasive. He was taken into custody in the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. According to the patrol room lawyer Zhang Tianyin's statement of the case, he requested a postponement. Then detective Bao reported that the investigation revealed that the defendant and the female servant who had gone out without returning had a suspicious relationship. If there was indeed a theft, it would be closely related to them. Watchman Ma Fusheng also provided a testimony.</p>
<p>When questioned about the confession, the defendant said that he had been serving in the master's house for more than ten years, and the female servant, named Li Ada, had arrived in the first month of this year. He and she had no improper behavior, but she had been out and had not returned since the afternoon of that day.

All the furniture and items in the room were also taken into the patrol room by car.

<h3>Carpenter Dies on Ship</h3>
<p>Ship's Staff Suspected of Abandoning Body Without Reporting. Lin Shengji, a carpenter from Taizhou, approximately 50 years old, was working in Shantou. Recently, he was suffering from a tumor and was accompanied by his fellow villager Wang Deji on a ship to Shanghai to transfer ships back home. On the 6th, he arrived in Shanghai. Later, at 5:00 PM on the 9th, he was still accompanied by Wang, carrying bedding, an old wooden box, saws, tools, and other items, to the Huangpu Beach Jiangtian Pier in the French Concession, to board the Hutai Bandaxing steamboat back to his hometown of Taizhou.</p>
<p>The Bandaxing steamboat was originally scheduled to exit at 4:00 PM on Friday, the 10th, and was docked at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. Because it was temporarily replacing the Chuanshan steamboat, passengers and cargo were transferred to Jiangtian Pier. Lin, due to illness, wanted to get on the ship early to have a comfortable place to sleep, so as to avoid the crowds. After boarding the ship, Wang entrusted the ship's purser to take care of him and gave him one yuan as a tip. Lin then spread out his bedding and slept. Unexpectedly, his illness gradually worsened. At 5:00 AM on the 10th, he died on the ship.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the steamboat did not report it to the patrol room. The crew carried the body to the pier and abandoned it. The abandoned tools were left next to a household's old wooden box, hoping to hide the matter. Later, the patrolman found the body and reported it to the Xiaodongmen Patrol Room, which sent detectives to investigate and inquired with the ship, which denied it. The detectives took the belongings back to the patrol room.</p>
<p>At noon, Wang Deji, who accompanied the deceased to the ship, went to the ship again to visit but could not find him. He asked the purser, who gave evasive answers, saying that Lin had died and the body was in the morgue. When the ship was asked about it, the remaining wooden box could not be hidden, so the company staff, including Weng Guoxun and two others, brought the purser to send the wooden box to the Tongren Fuyuantang Hall, instructing them to keep it for the corpse's relatives to claim. The hall did not dare to accept it rashly because the origin was unknown, so they telephoned the Xiaodongmen Patrol Room to inquire. The head of the patrol ordered the people and the box to be detained and sent detectives to open the box for inspection. Inside were twenty-three yuan in silver dollars and other carpenter's tools.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>While the items were being inspected, Wang Deji, a friend of the deceased, also arrived at the hall and identified the body as correct. At this point, the ship's attempt to abandon the corpse and shirk responsibility had become clear. The detectives brought the staff, the wooden box, and the friend of the deceased back to the patrol room for investigation. As the body had no family members in Shanghai, the head of the patrol ordered that photos be taken and instructed the Tongren Fuyuantang Hall to collect and store the coffin, waiting for the family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Go to Nanjing with Xiong Shihui Today</p>
<p>Headed this Way Under Telegram Summons from Chairman Chiang. Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, along with Deng Yanhua, Director of the Construction Department, Lin Yundai, Mayor of Guangzhou, Yang Jianping, former Superintendent of the Guangdong Customs, and secretaries and staff members, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Chichibu Maru at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to the Huishan Wharf to welcome them included Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Tang Haian, representative of Song Ziwen, Ouyang Rongzhi, former Chief of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and Sun Xiwen, Chen's secretary, and more than ten other people. After landing, Chen Mingshu immediately went to his residence with Xiong Shihui by car to rest. Our reporter made a special visit and recorded Chen's conversation in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Summoned by Telegram from Chiang. Chen said, "This time, I received a telegram summons from Commander-in-Chief Chiang at the front line, so I hurriedly came to Nanjing to pay my respects. It is now scheduled that tomorrow (i.e., today) I will go to Nanjing with Commander Xiong Shihui to report everything. Director Deng Yanhua will attend the National Industry and Commerce Conference. As for the length of my stay in Nanjing, it will be decided after paying my respects to Chiang. If I can take advantage of this trip to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I will be very fortunate." When the reporter asked what proposals the Guangdong Province had for the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Chen replied that they had not yet been prepared.</p>
<p>Current Situation in Guangxi. Chen also said, "The issue of the aftermath of the Guangxi situation will also be resolved in consultation with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Now, the remnants of Li, Huang, Zhang, Bai, and other enemies, since the Yunnan army captured Nanning, have been fleeing in defeat and are mostly concentrated in Liuzhou. They are exhausted and have no ability to resist."</p>

<p>Comforting the Front Lines. The reporter then asked whether he would go to the front lines to comfort the soldiers of the Jiang Guangding and Cai Tingkai divisions who participated in the campaign against Yan and Feng. Chen said, "I will make a decision after arriving in Nanjing, but I would very much like to go and comfort them." Chen then recounted in detail the circumstances of celebrating National Day on the Chichibu Maru on the 10th.</p>
<p>Celebration on Board. Chen said, "On the night of National Day, a celebration was held on board the ship. The owner of the Chichibu Maru was the host and provided various entertainment to add to the fun. First, the Chinese national anthem was sung, followed by speeches by foreign guests. Finally, the owner asked me to speak, and I said briefly, 'Ladies and gentlemen, today I have this opportunity to celebrate the National Day of the Republic of China with you all, which is something that I feel very honored about. At the same time, I would especially like to thank the captain of the Chichibu Maru for all his kindness to me. Every country in the world has its National Day, and today is the National Day of the Republic of China. But it is very difficult to have friends from all over the world, whom I have never met, join in this celebration on the same boat as tonight. I should, as a citizen of the Republic of China, express my greatest gratitude to you all. In fact, a "person," on a small scale, is a component of a country and society, and on a large scale, is a component of the human world. People have a duty to their country, and at the same time, they have a duty to the human world. The final and highest task of people is to seek world peace and human happiness. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not only on the same boat this time, but we will always be on the same boat in the future. As we celebrate the National Day of the Republic of China today, we should also anticipate the future of world harmony. So, ladies and gentlemen, please drink a full cup and wish the Republic of China a thousand years, world peace a thousand years, and human happiness a thousand years.' It was not until about 10:00 PM that everyone enjoyed themselves and went to bed."</p>
<h3>Li Zhonggong Announces Opinions on Reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>Fundamental Measures Can Be Determined</p>
<p>Li Zhonggong, Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, hosted a luncheon at the Xin Xin Restaurant yesterday at 12 noon for over twenty journalists from various newspapers and news agencies in this city. During the luncheon, Mr. Li announced his opinions on reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including the company's past history, current economic status, and future reorganization plans, which were very detailed. A summary of the main points is recorded below:</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was founded in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign (1872) with a loan of 200,000 strings of military funds, and has been in operation for 58 years. During these 58 years, its nature has changed repeatedly from official management to supervision by merchants and then to merchant management. The content has also become increasingly corrupt. Those who have been in charge of the company's affairs have invariably converted public resources into private gains, resulting in the enrichment of individuals and the impoverishment of the company. Exploitation and embezzlement have reached a point where it is impossible to salvage or rescue the situation. Even considering the "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited," which is nominally managed by merchants, there are two necessary conditions for a merchant-managed company: (1) legal registration with the government, and (2) a reliable list of shareholders. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company lacks both. Calling it a merchant-managed company is truly inappropriate. After the National Revolutionary Army established itself in the southeast, the importance of the shipping industry to politics, economy, and even social livelihood was recognized. Given the importance of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the shipping industry, the government sent personnel to investigate and take over its management. In the past three years, due to the Nationalist Government's repeated counter-revolutionary wars and the resulting circumstances, although former Director-General Zhao worked hard for two years, the reorganization did not achieve good results. Now that the counter-revolutionary military affairs are coming to an end, and taking advantage of this period to actively build, the Nationalist Government has decided to follow the Second Plenary Session, issue reorganization regulations, and appoint a committee. In the future, the reorganization committee will grasp the overall plan, and the commissioners will implement the policy, adhering to the central government's will, hoping to save the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from its impending demise and further develop and expand it. Working hard to achieve this is not difficult, because the economic situation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is by no means hopeless. Its assets are worth over 40 million taels, while its debts are only over 14 million taels. With assets of over 40 million taels, it is now bound by debts of over 14 million taels, to the point that it cannot recover. It is impossible not to feel heartbroken. The reasons for this are certainly not simple, but the uncertainty of its nature is also a reason for creditors to prevaricate. For example, if one wants to increase loans from bankers, the Director-General comes forward, but then there is the board of directors; if the board of directors comes forward, the board of directors is actually illegal and has long been unable to exercise its functions. Therefore, in the future, the government should decide on one of the five options and implement it: (1) recovering state ownership, (2) acting as agent, (3) official supervision and merchant management, (4) official-merchant joint management, and (5) merchant management. Once the fundamental principle is determined, it will be easier to proceed with the work. As for the above five options, the government is also giving them serious consideration. I cannot speak on their behalf, but in my personal opinion, merchant management is legally flawed, and official-merchant joint management also feels that the positions of officials and merchants are different, and their views are different, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Official supervision and merchant management have been tested, and the results are not very good. From the perspective of the party, following Sun Yat-sen's instructions, there is only one honest way: to recover state ownership. Fortunately, the central government will be able to decide on this fundamental measure in the near future. Once the fundamental measure is determined, legal debts will be easier to handle. That is, for the sake of developing the shipping industry, the government should also provide material assistance. At the same time, with the end of military affairs and the development of shipping, with a little reorganization, I dare to guarantee that we can restore the situation in 1928 and achieve a balance between income and expenditure. Currently, my colleagues feel very difficult, surrounded by scattered debts every day, unable to carry out business operations. Cutting redundant personnel requires paying back wages, eliminating coal scams, and clearing accumulated debts. In short, every move must first seek a solution to the debt problem. These scattered debts amount to about 2 million. I am currently planning to set it aside for now. However, I believe that the shipping industry is of great importance. In the future, I hope that the public opinion will provide guidance and assistance at any time, so that progress can be made smoothly, etc. Yan Duhe thanked on behalf of the press, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Debt Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>Eleven Committee Members Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is bound by debts and cannot be thoroughly reorganized. Mr. Li Zhonggong, Director-General of the company, recently proposed a fundamental plan to reform the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He first organized a debt reorganization committee. Once the debts are reorganized clearly, all the problems of improvement and expansion can be easily solved. It is learned that the newly announced members of the debt reorganization committee are: Director-General Li Zhonggong himself as Chairman, Li Guojie as Vice Chairman, and Song Shuqiao, Liang Hejun, Liu Yunfang, Li Zufan, Shen Zhongyi, Kong Xiangrong, Fu Jucun, Chen Zhiting, and Zhou Shian as members. In addition, committee members Chen and Zhou also serve as secretaries. They will start reorganizing all debts soon.</p>
<h3>National Silk Exhibition Opening Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Held at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the 3rd National Goods Promotion Week in this city held a National Goods Fashion Exhibition at the Dahua Hotel on the 9th of this month. The ladies and gentlemen who attended were all dressed in national silk, elegant and luxurious, which was a grand occasion, as previously reported. It is now heard that the silk industry groups in this city, because the exhibition on that day was still unable to fully show the merits of national silk, have consulted with the Social Affairs Bureau and agreed to hold the 3rd National Goods Promotion Week National Silk Exhibition at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at Tianhougong Bridge from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 13th of this month. They will collect famous and valuable silks from all over the country for people to visit freely, and prepare a large number of silk-made new clothes, high-quality clothing materials, and various daily necessities, which will be distributed to all sectors with coupons. Party, government, and business leaders will also attend the meeting to give speeches on the importance of national silk to the national economy and people's livelihood, and will practice it in accordance with the clothing regulations, setting an example for all sectors. There are also various noble recreational activities, too many to list. It is heard that a famous song and dance troupe and a national martial arts troupe have been invited to participate. At the end, Lu Xiaowu, Zhang Ye'er, and Yi Fangshuo will perform comic sketches to add to the fun. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Results of the Petition by Fishermen and Merchants in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Fishermen and merchants in the coastal counties of Zhejiang petitioned because pirates were rampant and fishing boats were repeatedly ravaged when they went out to sea to fish, resulting in insufficient fishing boats and fishermen. When boat owners were kidnapped, the bandits demanded ransom. If they did not comply, not only would the boat be sold to make up the number of people, but the lives of the fishermen would also be in danger. Moreover, fishing depends on boats. Once the boat is sold by the bandits, it is difficult to survive even if one escapes. Therefore, last month, fishermen and merchants from the famous coastal counties of Zhejiang sent representatives to Beijing to petition the central government. The representatives included Dinghai County Representative Ren, Yuhuan Yang Jingxun, Xiangshan Yu Yudou, and Wenling Guo Zhaojun. Yesterday, the representatives returned to Shanghai and told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency that after they arrived in Beijing, they petitioned the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Navy, and submitted the suffering of fishermen and merchants being robbed to the Ministry of Navy, because winter is approaching and the fishing industry is booming day by day. They especially requested the ministry to order warships to escort them. As a result, Chen Shaokuan, Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs, agreed to send three warships to Zhejiang to protect them at that time. The Ministry of Interior also promised to make proper arrangements. We will stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then return to report.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Old Lauder, the owners of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., happened to be in Nanjing and rushed back by plane the night before to see them off.

Mr. Kinoshita, who will be the Acting Consul-General during the leave, is expected to arrive on the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Ding Guitang's Talk After Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Sincerity of Liaoning and Zhang Towards the Central Government</p>
<p>Xin, who Occupied the Tax Office According to Shih Fan Tax Commissioner of the General Customs Office and Chinese Secretary Mr. Ding Guitang, was previously ordered by Mr. Merrell, the Tax Commissioner of the General Customs Office, to go to Tianjin to handle the aftermath of the Tianjin Customs. Mr. Ding stayed in Tianjin for a total of two months and returned to Shanghai by the Tianjin Maru a few days ago. When a reporter met Mr. Ding, he was informed of the various recent events in Tianjin, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After Xin Bosen was ordered by Yan to forcibly occupy the Tianjin Customs, Mr. Ding was ordered to go to Tianjin twice. The first time, he went to Taiyuan to negotiate with Yan in Shanxi, explaining the benefits of unifying the customs administration. At that time, Yan in Shanxi had already recognized the principle in principle, but in the end, he could not admit his mistake and withdraw his order. After the second trip to Tianjin, Mr. Ding went to Shenyang three times to meet with Commander Zhang and made many statements on the customs administration, which were greatly appreciated by Mr. Zhang. Therefore, after the changes in the north this time, although Xin tried his best to lobby Chanlian, Mr. Zhang did not comment on it, which was all due to Mr. Ding's prior arrangements. According to Mr. Ding, when Xin finally went to Shenyang, he saw Zhang and said that he should first offer one million yuan as a condition for Chanlian. Mr. Zhang smiled and said that I don't want any of the customs in the three northeastern provinces, why do I only love your two million yuan? Later, Xin pleaded hard to save face. Mr. Zhang said, you should save face, why don't I need to save face? If I indulge your personal feelings, I am afraid I will lose faith in the world, etc. After Xin was rebuffed, he hurriedly returned to Tianjin, closed the door and did not come out. Unexpectedly, he was finally taken advantage of by assassins. It is true that a frustrated person always encounters frustrating things. According to the report Mr. Ding obtained, Xin's assassination this time was actually done by Shih Fan. Xin was fighting for profits with Shih Fan, and Shih Fan had accumulated deep hatred. The reason for assassinating him was because they were afraid that if he did not die, he would secretly plan revenge, and Shih Fan would be caught in one fell swoop. Now that he is not in office, even if he does not die, he will not be able to take revenge. Mr. Ding also strongly stated that Zhang's sincerity towards the central government is absolute, and he has no thoughts of warlord feudalism. He also has a strong enthusiasm for maintaining the unity of customs administration.</p>

<h3>County Magistrate's Wife Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Zhou Shumei, the magistrate of Ruian County, Zhejiang Province, married Ms. Xu (32 years old this year) from Jiangshan, Zhejiang Province, in 1924 and had two children. However, Zhou married a concubine and favored her, and lived with her in the post, leaving Ms. Xu and her children in Shanghai, renting a residence at 35 Duanhua Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, and hiring a maid. Zhou gave Ms. Xu a certain amount of money for expenses every month. Recently, Ms. Xu, not knowing what kind of stimulation she had received, suddenly had suicidal thoughts. At about 1:00 PM on the 9th, she took a hemp rope in the room, covered her head with wool, and committed suicide by hanging herself. It was not until 3:00 PM that she was discovered by a roommate, who rushed to rescue her, but her breathing had stopped, her body was still warm, and blood was flowing from her nostrils. She immediately notified her brother Xu Zhongqi (a law student) and asked a doctor from Baolong Hospital to inject a life-saving injection, but it was ineffective and she died. Xu Zhongqi immediately notified her husband by telegram and reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was moved to the Tongrentuan Fuyuantang autopsy room. Yesterday, the criminal section of the French Police reported to Judge Zhu of the French Court, who came to the scene and verified that the deceased had indeed died by hanging herself. After Mr. Zhu questioned the deceased's brother, he ordered the body to be photographed and allowed the deceased's brother to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Robbers Visit in Sleep</h3>
<p>Yongtai Pawnshop Robbed of Thousands of Gold. The Yongtai Pawnshop at 73, corner of Macao Bao Road, Vagner Road, French Concession, was suddenly visited by four robbers at about 3:00 AM yesterday. They climbed from the old house behind Shouan Lane (where houses are being demolished) to the roof of the pawnshop and broke into the shop. All the partners in the shop were asleep, so they did not know that the robbers had entered. Later, they woke up the partners and showed their handguns to threaten them. Seeing this, the partners did not dare to speak out and were as quiet as cicadas in winter. They were driven into a small room and guarded by a robber. The remaining robbers rummaged through boxes and cabinets and robbed more than 200 yuan in cash and gold, silver, pearl, and diamond jewelry from the jewelry room, worth about three or four catties. The robbers hid the stolen goods in their clothes and pockets. When they were about to search other places, they heard the sound of dung carts outside on the road, knowing that dawn was approaching, so they stopped, calmly took the stolen goods, and escaped through the front door.

<p>Zhang Wenhuan, translator of the Shanghai Blind Continental Newspaper, Fan Fubao, director of education of the Shanghai Blind Children's School, and Lu Zude, director of education of the Group Learning Society's Blind Children's School, etc., in view of the fact that there is no construction in the domestic blind person's cause, gathered blind comrades on October 11 to discuss remedial measures at the Blind Children's School on Yidingpan Road in this city. More than 30 people attended the meeting, and Lu Zude served as the temporary chairman. It was resolved to organize a group in imitation of the British and American Blind Person's Cause Construction Association. Chapters, etc. were purchased from the countries on the same day for reference and implementation, and Fan Fubao was appointed to draft the origin. At the same time, the comrades were divided to solicit enthusiastic people who are concerned about blind person issues to jointly initiate the organization. It is heard that Mr. Chuan Bulan, the president of the Shanghai Blind Children's School, has been very helpful to this matter. In the future, he will introduce people from the West to participate in this association as much as possible, and it is hoped that the blind community will give more support.</p>

For a moment, there was a lot of noise and the passers-by were cold. When the person was examined, he had no hope of survival.</p>
<h3>Fire in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nine Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>Four or Five Houses Demolished Wang Xingsheng's house, a carpenter who lived at 16 Yangjiazhai, the first house on the west side of Caojing Town, Western Shanghai, at about 8:30 PM the night before (9th), after Wang's wife, Ms. Lu, cooked dinner, she threw out the ashes from the stove, discarding them in the chicken coop. However, because the embers had not been extinguished, they burned the firewood piled nearby. In a moment, the spark became a prairie fire and broke through the roof in an instant. It was too late to clean up. By the time the Caohejing Municipal Public Security Bureau's Sixth District Third Office and the Security Corps heard the news and rushed to help with the fire fighting, the river water was dry and the wind was helping the fire, making it difficult to extinguish it in a moment. As a result, the houses of Tu Dongsheng on the west side were also burned until 9:15 PM, when it was finally extinguished. A total of nine houses were burned down and four or five houses were demolished. Fortunately, it was early and no one was killed, but the cotton that had been collected was all burned, resulting in a huge loss. Later, the police station in charge transferred the family of Wang Lu, who started the fire, and Wang Bu Sheng, who lived with her, to the station for detailed inquiries about the cause of the fire, so that they could be investigated.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I have just read the news item “Collapse of House in Qingli Injures and Kills Workers” published in your esteemed newspaper on the 9th of this month in the local section, which stated that the construction was sloppy and unable to bear the weight, etc. I was shocked to read this. Our factory is located at the corner of the French Avenue and the Vegetable Market Street, and the construction of the three-story Yuqingli building is nearing completion. At 7:00 PM on that day, when work was stopped, the workers went down to the ground together. However, at that time, the scaffolding was full of heavy bricks, and the workers were in a hurry to get down, and due to carelessness, a part of the top scaffolding was knocked down, so three workers and the heavy bricks fell together, and at the same time, the awning on the third-floor balcony was also crushed, and three workers fell to the ground together, suffering minor injuries. Fortunately, the injured workers were immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, and all have been discharged today. I am now writing to your newspaper to correct this information, as it has affected the business of our factory. I would be grateful if your newspaper could quickly correct the record and clarify the truth. Thank you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gu Yinji Construction Company</p>
<p>October 9th</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The Customer Reproaches the Trunk Seller - Last time I came to buy this trunk, you clearly told me that this trunk was exceptionally sturdy and would never break until I died. How come it's broken after only two months?</p>
<p>The Trunk Shop Employee - It's just that when you came last time, you looked pale and thin, as if you were sick, so I said that.</p>
<p>A (at an art exhibition) - Friend, look at this landscape painting, how lifelike it is! You only need to look at it quietly for ten minutes, and you will feel cold all over.</p>
<p>B - That's right, good paintings do have this kind of magic. Last year, I hung an oil painting in my house of torrential rain, just like the real thing. One day, I was not at home, and a friend came to see me, and couldn't help but take my raincoat away.</p>
<p>Father (looking at a report card just sent from school in front of his son) - Conduct: poor, Chinese: poor, Arithmetic: poor, History: poor, Geography: poor... How do you explain that everything is poor?</p>
<p>Son - I don't know either.</p>
<p>Father - These are your own grades, how can you say you don't know?</p>
<p>Son - Dad, people's hearts are not what they used to be. There are a lot of fake banknotes and fake checks. Maybe this report card is fake too.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Tan Zu'an's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Lan</p>
<p>Tan was the third son of Governor-General Tan of Fujian and Zhejiang. In June of the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign, Tan was appointed Governor-General of Fujian and Zhejiang by imperial decree. At that time, someone memorialized that the number of Zhejiang troops was half-empty and the military administration was not well-maintained. When he arrived in Zhejiang by imperial order, he was ordered to inspect the Zhejiang troops. Governor-General Tan ordered a grand review on July 1st. My uncle, Boyu, was a secretary and also reviewed the literary works of the princes. At that time, I was studying at the Gujing Academy. Because the grand review was a rare event that occurred every ten years, I asked my family to take me to watch. It was at this time that I met Zu'an. Zu'an was fifteen years old at the time, slightly younger than me. Even during the grand review, with cannons booming, Zu'an talked and laughed calmly and even composed two poems and sent them to Governor-General Tan. Governor-General Tan was in high spirits and also composed a seven-character poem. I also wrote an ancient style poem about the event. Later, I went to see my maternal aunt, the wife of Lord Hou of the Fuzhou Prefecture, through the Xianxia Pass in Fujian Province, and I was able to meet Zu'an again. It was the Double Ninth Festival, so we took a trip to West Lake. Although the West Lake in Fuzhou is not as famous as the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zu'an liked to talk about military affairs from a young age. Every time he went in and out, he would bring a small team of hundreds of people with him. All of these team members were selected from teenagers aged sixteen or seventeen, so the military appearance was very impressive. I also liked to ride horses when I was young. This trip from Xianxia Ridge to Fujian, the Peach Blossom Leopard I rode was a famous horse from Guizhou. When my grandfather was guarding Taizhou, he was also under the command of Governor-General Tan. However, there was leadership in the official field, and our interactions were informal. Since Zu'an's brothers considered my uncles and nephews, we addressed each other as "older brother." There were many tourists in Wanzaitang that day. Although we occupied the central seat, our actions were restrained. Zu'an proposed hunting, and I followed suit. When we reached Nanshan, we opened the hunting grounds. Although there were not many mountain rabbits and deer nearby, we caught one deer and seven wild rabbits that day. The ammunition consumed only heard the sound of guns and cannons. It could also be seen that the game was extravagant. The residents were alarmed by the cannons that day and suspected that there was an abnormal event, and some even moved their families into the city. They did not know that we were just playing a game. The next day, my maternal aunt asked and told me about it. My maternal aunt and uncle were afraid that I would stay in Fujian for too long and get into trouble because of my love of playing, so they sent me back to Zhejiang that day. Governor-General Tan also strictly restricted his young son from bringing weapons into the city without reason. In the Gui Mao year, Zu'an entered the Hanlin Academy as a top scholar, and I also passed the provincial examination with the title of Ding You. Now that Zu'an has passed away, the coffin is closed and the final verdict is made. I am drifting in the sea of people, not knowing what the future holds. I will just talk about the events of my childhood to relieve my boredom. (Returned payment)</p>
<h3>Two Strange Monks in Gaoyou</h3>
<p>— Qingping</p>
<p>Fakong, the receptionist monk of Gaoyou Qianming Temple, whose secular surname is Yang, is commonly known as Monk Yang. He is over thirty years old. He has cut off all food ten years ago, eating pine branches when hungry and drinking well water when thirsty. He does not wash his face or bathe every day, but his skin is clean and white, without any dirt. It is truly a strange thing.</p>
<p>According to a visitor from Wangjiagang in the county, there is a monk named Zhihui in the Dawang Temple in that place. At the age of five, he contracted a strange disease. After being treated by famous doctors and cured, he could not eat grains. He only eats two feet of old cloth a day to satisfy his hunger. He has been doing this for more than thirty years. His body is quite strong and no different from ordinary people. However, he must drink three catties of sorghum wine after eating.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony of the National Products Movement Conference - Snippets</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the opening ceremony of the 3rd Shanghai National Products Movement Conference was held at the former site of the City Hall on Nanjing Road. The general situation has been published in this newspaper. The following are some miscellaneous notes of what I saw on that day.</p>
<p>The venue was upstairs. The registration books were placed at the entrance, a total of four books. After the guests signed in, they were each given a copy of the National Products Review and a special issue of the Movement Conference. On both sides of the stairs, the Sanyou Industrial Society displayed men's and women's clothing made of 212 cloth, arranged on wooden frames. There were dozens of them, large and small, arranged in a row, like the court officials standing in line in the Qing Dynasty. It was quite a sight to see. A half-length portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the silk industry, was hung on the stage. A table was set up in the middle, with two bottles of fresh flowers on top, as the speaker's table. A table was set up on each side for the reporters. The presidium consisted of four people: Mr. Feng Yuhongjun, Secretary of the Municipal Government, Mr. Wang Yansong, member of the Municipal Party Committee, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They all wore glasses and red silk badges. Only Wang Yansong was not wearing a mandarin jacket. The other three were all wearing blue robes and black jackets. Only Wang Xiaolai was wearing satin shoes. The other three were wearing leather shoes. The stage was surrounded by white cloth, with the twelve large characters "The 3rd Shanghai National Products Movement Conference" written on it. Mr. Yu Hongjun delivered the opening speech, detailing the reasons for the weak effect of boycotting foreign goods in previous years, and the will to promote national products should be considered from three aspects. Mr. Pan Gongzhan reported on the preparations, saying that more than 300 million yuan of money was spent on purchasing foreign goods every year. Merchants are greedy for the high profits of selling foreign goods, and they try to figure out the psychology of customers, and even impersonate domestic goods as foreign goods. I hope that fathers will tell their sons and brothers will encourage their younger brothers to purchase domestic goods. If imported goods are abandoned, the loopholes will be plugged and the country will be strong. Mr. Wang Yansong said that holding a national products movement conference is like taking medicine when seriously ill. It is not a good thing. I hope that after this conference, all compatriots will deeply understand the great righteousness and purchase domestic goods. Next year, today, there will be no need to hold the 4th National Products Movement Conference. Mr. Wang Xiaolai's speech was the simplest. He only said that domestic goods are cheaper and more durable than foreign goods. Please pay attention to this. His voice was loud and moved the audience. Mr. Shou Yicheng, representative of the Visiting Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, gave a speech, mainly focusing on new national products, with a new national vision, and dividing the methods into four items: invention, promotion, protection, and research. He encouraged the government, business community, scholars, and society to cooperate and divide the work. He used the invention of automobiles in the United States and rickshaws in Japan as examples, saying that we must work hard to move forward in order to keep pace with other countries. When Mr. Zhang Zilian gave his speech, he said that there were many stores on Nanjing Road that promoted foreign goods. The three major companies were like three fortresses, standing beside the China National Products Joint Market. He believed that the National Products Joint Market was established with a spirit of struggle. If things go against his wishes and he fails, he will never give up as long as he is still alive. He should fight to the end. He hoped that the various national groups in this city would unite and assist in the joint effort to address the fact that China's economy has been invaded to the extreme. If we do not promote national products and try to remedy the situation, then danger and destruction will be imminent. This National Products Movement Conference, in view of the fact that men and women's attire is competing for Europeanization, and everyone is tending towards imported goods, a fashion show was held to make everyone aware that Chinese national goods can also be used as fashion. The intention is far-reaching. He hopes that the government and business community will cooperate and be able to achieve the goal. His words were passionate and exciting, so the applause was thunderous.</p>
<h3>Talking About Methods of Capturing the Qiantang River Tide</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>The annual Zhejiang Tide has aroused increasing interest among Shanghai gentlemen and ladies in recent years. Those who love photography regard it as a unique and excellent opportunity.</p>
<p>Capturing the image of the river tide is more difficult than ordinary photographs. When the tide comes, it is as fast as a galloping horse, passing by in an instant. Beginners in photography will be at a loss and miss the opportunity if they are not prepared. I have some experience in this field and dare to offer a few words of advice to those watching the tide.</p>
<p>The light sensitivity of the tide line is faster than that of ordinary scenery. Because the reflection of the water is very strong, the aperture should be slightly smaller, otherwise the water lines will be difficult to see clearly. When the tide line is coming from afar, point the lens directly at the tide line and use normal shutter speeds. However, if the tide line has swept across in front of the lens, you must use the fastest speed on the lens box you are using. The distance should be set to the farthest setting. Otherwise, you will only see splashing water and the momentum of the tide will not be shown.</p>
<p>Developing the tide image is also difficult. If the light sensitivity is insufficient or excessive, it all depends on the developer's ability to properly remedy the situation in order to complete a beautiful film. Even if you take a very good film, it must be developed properly in order to fully show the fine lines of the tide water. I heard that the Kodak business office in the Hong Chen Pharmacy in this city has now been specially contracted by a number of Western clubs and large companies. Specialist technicians are processing and developing the "tide photography" photos this time. Those Chinese people who want to obtain good results may wish to try it.</p>
<h3>Safety Equipment of Shanghai Banks</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>The establishment of banks is for circulating finance, facilitating remittance, safekeeping treasures, and promoting savings. It is a one-stop shop for several benefits. It complements the money houses and promotes the prosperity of the market. Therefore, banks are the throat of society. However, in this chaotic world, people's hearts are treacherous and have reached the extreme. And this place where money is piled high and colorful paper is abundant is most likely to arouse the covetousness of thieves. Although it is said that the management is meticulous and comprehensive, robbery cases still occur from time to time, which is regrettable. Recently, there have been even more solid instruments to ensure the safety of banks and protect depositors. What is this instrument? It is a vault. My friend, Lang, works in a bank and told me that two major banks in Shanghai, referred to as A and B, have installed this type of vault. It is said that there is no need to worry about water, fire, or thieves. However, the construction cost is huge, about one million yuan. In this vault, there is a room with thousands of drawers, which are called safety deposit boxes. All of them are connected to electricity, from the inside to the outside. The vault door is especially strong and unusual. There are also mechanisms placed under it. What is even more strange is that the opening and closing of the vault door is scheduled for a fixed time every day. Therefore, the vault manager should pay extra attention when entering and leaving the vault. Otherwise, if it closes in the vault after the deadline, he will not be able to come out that day. However, banks install this solid and foolproof vault. The assistance to the development of their business is not small. Therefore, I heard that the safety deposit boxes in Bank A have already been fully rented out, for depositors to store valuable items. Those who come later are all disappointed and have to turn to Bank B for safekeeping and storage. Bank B may soon be fully booked as well. It is said that the safekeeping fee is four yuan per year per household, and each household will be given a key.</p>

<h3>New Knowledge for the Family</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>With the arrival of autumn, everyone's skin feels dry, mostly due to anemia. The skin layer lacks fat nourishment. It is very effective to apply milk mixed with borax glycerin. However, milk is very easy to spoil, so it is better to use Wudi brand Die Cream, because Die Cream is made from milk cheese, does not contain alkali, and can absorb nutrients from the air to moisturize the skin. Therefore, it can prevent cracking and relieve pain and itching. As for internal blood tonics, Wudi brand grape juice or wine is the most suitable. The skin of women and children is extremely delicate and easily damaged by wind and sun, so they often apply powder for protection. The use of paint on houses and whitewash on walls is more durable and newer than those without paint or whitewash. It is also to protect the weak quality of the content, increase the appearance of the exterior, and facilitate the washing of dirt and resistance to wind and sun. The method is very good. However, the face powder in ancient times was made by burning copper tin. Lead has three types: white lead, which is translated as zinc; second is blue lead, which is translated as ; and third is black lead, which is directly translated as lead. Among the three, black lead is the cheapest and easily oxidized. When made into lead powder, it turns black when it encounters magnetism, so it is harmful to tiger skin. Western face powder is made of zinc white, while East Asian face powder is made of blue lead. Test with sulfuric acid, and it is easy to identify. Those that do not change color are harmless to the skin. The blue box powder of Wudi brand is zinc white, and the yellow box powder is added with bismuth. The fineness and smoothness are better than lead powder, which is due to the proper combination. Therefore, its advantages are comparable to the face powder of East and West Asia. It is truly a good product in skin protection agents. The method of use is to apply Die Cream first, and then powder, so it is not sticky. It is very different from ordinary vulgar powder and cannot be mentioned on the same day.</p>
<p>Imported Western pocket mirror box powder, once used up, often has no way to add powder. You can mail it to Shanghai National Products Road Family Industry Cooperative for repacking, but attach a three-corner stamp. If the size is two inches in diameter, the cooperative has already made and issued "Wudi brand matching powder" for only two cents. All department stores sell it. There is also a small aluminum box with silk powder, which can also be used directly. However, when transferring it to the mirror box, the powder tray should be taken out, and the empty box can be used for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (291)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Cui Zhu's tears stain the Yiren's heart broken, Hong Lian's fragrance fades and a woman's soul leaves</p>
<p>Cuiyun shook her head and said, "She committed suicide. All those who commit suicide, one breath is never able to come back. For a moment, they hate themselves extremely. As the saying goes, 'It is better to live a bad life than to die a good death.' Why do you want to commit suicide? But when you reach a state of extreme anger and hatred, you can jump into the water and jump into the fire. If you think about it afterwards, you die in vain. For example, people like us, even if a hundred of us die, it only counts as fifty pairs. When I was in Zhang's house before, I wanted to commit suicide several times. But I don't have Lianxiang's stubbornness. After things pass, I endure like this." Zuo Shichen said, "That's right. Listening to a few of your words is worth reading a suicide theory. Then why did she commit suicide?" Cuiyun said, "Listen to me slowly telling you. That Mr. Yin who was with her was a wealthy man from Huzhou. When we were in Bingqingli, Mr. Yin came to visit. He was a tall man, over forty years old, and was extremely kind. He never put on airs. No one could tell that he was a wealthy man. When it came to my marriage, Lianxiang also married this Mr. Yin. At that time, there was more than one Mr. Yin who wanted to marry Lianxiang. There was also a younger guest. Of course, he was not as rich as Mr. Yin. Everyone advised her to marry Mr. Yin, because he was rich and had a good temper. Lianxiang herself also said, "I came to the hall door with a sacrificial purpose. Marrying a rich man can get a little more money. Then the mother's living expenses and the brothers' tuition fees, they can save and live their lives. If they are lucky, they may be able to help them a little in the future. It doesn't matter if you marry someone a little older." Everyone at the time also thought that Lianxiang had a good temper and Mr. Yin had a good temper. Two people with good tempers, put together, could not be better. After I married Zhang Yiqing, I heard that Lianxiang had married Mr. Yin. I was still envious of her. I thought Lianxiang had finally suffered for a few years and jumped out of the fire pit. Who knew that later I found out that there was also a tigress in Mr. Yin's family, that is, Mrs. Yin. Mrs. Yin is the daughter of the Yu family. She was famous in her maiden family as a demanding lady. After marrying, she managed Mr. Yin very strictly. The more strictly she managed, the more Mr. Yin liked to come out and play. According to him, there is no fun at home, so he has to come out for a walk. Some friends also said that Mr. Yin and Mrs. Yin are not like husband and wife, but like mother and daughter. At home, you can only hear the voice of the wife. Mr. Yin is almost silent. Perhaps Mr. Yin's silent and good temper was also cultivated by this wife. People only know that Lianxiang has a good temper and Mr. Yin has a good temper, but they don't think about the third person. This third person's tigress is difficult to deal with."</p>

<h3>Gold Market After Opening</h3>
<p>Fluctuations were generally calm with no special changes. Yesterday, the 11th, gold transactions operated as usual. The gold market weakened but then strengthened, ultimately declining slightly with no exceptional movements, fluctuating by only two and a half taels. Sentiment among dealers was stable, while foreign exchange rates loosened slightly, with posted rates rising by one increment. Trading within the market differed significantly, with buyers generally predominating. Companies such as Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Heng Xing, and Fu Chang were all buying, operating smoothly. Shun Li, Fu Yu, and Tong Tai Chang were all selling. The market opened lower due to successive gains in silver bars in the morning. Subsequently, as the buying interest persisted and exchange rates were obviously strong with hidden firmness, the trend turned upwards but with a slight containment. Occasional transactions of one or two taels were observed. Later, a mediocre state of uncoined silver bullion was seen beyond sixty-six taels. The forward contract premium was approximately sixteen taels. The market closed early around noon because of the Sixth day of the month. The following is a summary of the morning market situation.</p>
<h3>Gold Bullion Opens Higher, Closes Lower: November Forward Gold</h3>
<p>The initial opening price for November gold bullion was 664 taels and 2 mace, a drop of 2 taels and 4 mace. This was because large silver bars rose a total of three-sixteenths of a unit yesterday and today, and the price of silver rose three-eighths of a unit. However, the European market was flat, and the US market appeared to be selling off, which allowed the gold price to remain stable. Afterwards, fluctuations occurred between one tael above and below, dropping from 65 taels to 63 taels and 2 mace, due to sales by Zhi Feng Yong and small scrap dealers. It then rose again by approximately 4 taels, with Heng Xing Sheng Da and others buying. When the government order was announced, the rate had increased by 0.25, with the US dollar increasing by 0.5 yuan and Japanese gold decreasing slightly by 0.0125 yuan. However, the gold price only decreased by a few cash units, settling at 63 taels and 5 fen. Internal exchange rates remained stable. Holland bought British gold for this month at 7 pence and 4375, and Anda also bought January gold at the same rate. Fu Chang, Li Chang, and Heng Xing competed fiercely to buy, immediately jumping up 2 taels at 10:00 to 65 taels and 7 qian. Afterwards, Yuan Mao Yong, Shun Li, and hedging firms all sold. January gold bought December British gold at 7.5 pence. After 10:30, the price dropped slightly by one tael, followed by small fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Strong Buying Interest Leads to Rise:</h3>
<p>At 11:00, the price was 63 taels and 8 mace, but later it rose again, fluctuating by only 4 or 5 mace. After 11:30, the price jumped more than one tael, driven by strong buying interest from Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, and Shun Mao. At noon closing, the price settled at 65 taels and 7 mace, successively rising by about 2 taels, pushing the price above 66 taels. However, compared to the posted rate before the market closure (October 9th), it was still down 9 qian. Since Wednesday, it has dropped by a total of 6 taels and some change. The highest price for the half-day was 65 taels and 7 mace, and the lowest price was 63 taels and 2 mace, a difference of 2 and a half taels. The quoted price has been changed to 615 taels because Japanese gold was quoted down 0.0125, initially at 51 taels even, and at noon it was suppressed to 49 taels even. The book price was 70 taels to 66 taels, with water money at 70 taels. Early in the morning, the price of goods opened at 64 taels and 3 mace and closed at 67 taels at noon.</p>
<h3>Swapping is Actively Compensating for Shorts:</h3>
<p>Trading among various firms was relatively active. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Yu Xing Yong, Heng Xing, Sheng Da, Li Chang, and Fu Chang were all buyers. Yuan Tai, Fu Tai Heng, Yu Da, Yi Yu, and Yi Chang had mixed positions. Shun Li, Tai Xing, Tong Tai Chang, Wan Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, and Da Kang Run were mostly sellers. Hedgers were active, and outside firms were slightly increasing their positions to cover short positions as the swap date approached. Dalian brokers sold a total of 800-900 bars and bought 200 of them. Guangdong brokers bought approximately 1000 bars to offset previous sales.</p>
<h3>Huai River Exchange Rates: Marked Increase, Hidden Firmness</h3>
<p>Over the past two days, overseas silver markets have repeatedly risen, but the market situation has not undergone any significant changes. The United States has been selling, so the future market is uncertain. British-American exchange rates have fluctuated slightly, while Yokohama-US rates have risen. The Kobe market was unchanged yesterday. HSBC has increased its listed rates by one increment, with British gold rising by 0.25 to 1 shilling and 7 pence, US dollars increased by 0.5 yuan to 39 yuan, Indian rupees rose by 0.75 to 107 rupees, Dutch guilders increased by 1.25 yuan to 96.5 guilders, French francs rose by 13 yuan to 993 yuan, German marks increased by 2.5 yuan to 164 marks, Singapore dollars decreased by 2 taels to 145 taels, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.0125 to 41 taels and 2 mace and 7.5 fen. Hong Kong was unchanged at 82.5 taels (but there was no formal market). Early on, transactions in the internal banking market loosened slightly, then stabilized. However, different positions led to variations in quoted prices. Compared to before the market closure (October 9th), British gold rose slightly by 0.0625, US dollars rose by 0.125, and Japanese gold was unchanged. The gold price was weak in the morning but stable in the afternoon, fluctuating by two or three taels, ultimately declining slightly (compared to October 9th). Sentiment was still good, resulting in divergent trends between quoted and hidden exchange rates. Chinese merchants sold slightly to acquire gold. Approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with strong demand from banks. Holland, Anda, and Zheng Jin all bought, while Da Tong and Da Ying sold slightly. US dollars worth over 200,000 yuan were traded between Chinese and Japanese banks, while only Dalian merchants sold Japanese gold. However, few gold firms were involved in receipts and disbursements. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the weekend.</p>

<h3>Large Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars</h3>

The early and noon prices for Guangdong coins were also the same, at 6 qian, 3 fen, 7 li and 2 hao and a half, with slight transactions. 220,000 jiao were traded in the early market and 55,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 cash units, reaching 389,000 cash units.</p>

Other spot bond transactions totaled only 14,000 yuan. Forward contracts were approximately 5.7 million yuan in the morning and over 4.2 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling nearly 10 million yuan. Trading in the 96 Bonds reached 2 million.

<h3>Post-Festival, the Yarn Market Shows Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak because spot sales are sluggish after the festival, and all sectors are inactive, leading to great disappointment among bulls. Sellers are taking advantage of the opportunity to exert downward pressure, further weakening the market. However, overseas market conditions are relatively strong, and retail bulls are showing some signs of emerging, intensifying the downward trend. One manufacturer is maintaining a firm stance. Overall, the lack of demand for spot yarn makes it difficult for the market to flourish.</p>
<h3>Sellers Pressure the Market</h3>
<p>The opening price in the morning was slightly firm due to the rebound in US cotton, but each month rose by 0.04 to 0.05 yuan. As there were few buyers in the second and third sessions, the price fell again, each month falling by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. In the afternoon, the number of sellers increased, and the downward trend intensified, with the situation worsening. Each month fell by 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07 yuan. A total of 16,550 bales were traded throughout the day. Yu Da bought 1,100 bales, Heng De 1,350 bales, Yuan De 1,100 bales, Sen Kang 700 bales, Xin Cheng 800 bales, Li Chang 750 bales, and others 300 to 500 bales. Yi Yu sold 2,900 bales, Da Ji 2,350 bales, and others 500 to 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yarn Market Closing Prices and Inventories:</p>
<p>| Month   | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>| :------ | :------------ | :----- | :-------- |</p>
<p>| October | 15.15         | Up 0.08 | 29,050    |</p>
<p>| January | 15.08         | Down 0.03 | 33,550    |</p>
<p>| November | 15.08         | Up 0.09 | 38,900    |</p>
<p>| February | 15.10         |  | 72,600     |</p>

<p>| March | 15.15        | | 83,800 |</p>
<h3>Current Yarn Needed by Customers Falls</h3>
<p>The sales of current yarn are mediocre. According to statistics, different groups of customers bought a total of 875 bales. 100 bales were traded among domestic businesses. Prices fell by 0.05 yuan. Foreign customers bought 150 bales from inland areas, 25 bales from Xuzhou, 40 bales from Nanxun, 160 bales from Hankou, 160 bales from Sichuan, 35 bales from Biaodao, and 130 bales from miscellaneous areas.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Trend Toward Lower Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending downward, but the decline in US cotton is relatively restrained. This is because imported cotton prices are falling daily, while domestic cotton prices remain firm due to tight controls by domestic businesses. Recently, imported cotton prices have risen slightly, and some have taken the opportunity to sell, causing the market to fall. However, Japanese traders are heavily shorting the market, approximately 10,000 dan. The overall situation remains poor due to weak consumption. A large number of domestic merchants are still increasing their holdings, so there are significant changes to come in the cotton market.</p>
<h3>Recent Hankou Cotton Falls by 0.04 Yuan</h3>
<p>The opening price of Hankou Cotton was weak due to a lack of buyers, with prices falling by 0.015 yuan each month. The market weakened further in the afternoon due to long liquidation, with prices falling by 0.005 to 0.015 yuan. However, Japanese traders shorted a significant amount. A total of 70,300 dan were traded throughout the day. Yuan Da bought 7,400 dan, Heng De 6,100 dan, Gong Tai 7,200 dan, Heng Yi 2,000 dan, and others 1,000 to 1,700 dan. Li Chang sold 5,600 dan, Tong Xing 3,200 dan, Shen Da 3,200 dan, Tian Chang 4,900 dan, and others 1,000 to 2,000 dan. The closing prices for Hankou Cotton are listed below:</p>

<p>| March | 31.65        | | 220,400 |</p>
<h3>Little Demand From Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>Business in the current cotton market is poor. Imported cotton is entering the market again. The source of cotton is 470 bales of Tonghua cotton. Ping Qie Factory: 27.00 Yong An Factory: 2,000 pieces of American cotton were sent to the factory on the 11th month, 2,000 pieces on the 11th, Cai Dian cotton at 32.25 was 150 pieces, Bei Shi cotton at 31.25 was 500 bales, Hanxi Da cotton at 33.25 was 200 pieces, Shuangzhan Jiao Yao cotton was 31.16, and 300 bales were from customers.</p>

<h3>US Department of Agriculture Schedules Meeting to Discuss Strengthening the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>A New York dispatch from the 10th reports on cotton market conditions over the past two weeks: Prior to the release of the US government's cotton production report on Wednesday, prices had fallen to new lows for this cotton crop due to liquidation and selling pressure from the South, but recovered slightly afterward. However, due to weakness in wheat and securities prices, the cotton market remained unstable. Official sources indicated that cotton production was increasing, placing estimates of cotton supply for this cotton season on a firmer foundation, although frost in cotton-growing areas could reduce it slightly. Representatives from the Cotton Industry Bureau and textile mills are scheduled to meet next Monday in New Orleans to discuss plans to strengthen the cotton market. Some expect this meeting to produce recommendations, but news of the meeting has not had a major impact on the recent cotton market. Sentiment remains mixed, with some predicting that current prices will affect cotton acreage and stimulate consumption, leading to future price increases. Others predict that prices will continue to fall under the pressure of the new cotton crop. The weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Rice: Early and Late Rice See Sales from Both Northern and Southern Merchants</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were some arrivals of early rice. The market seemed slightly soft due to weak demand from local villages. However, the market recovered as merchants from Fuzhou and the North began buying. Transactions were more active than the previous day, and prices appeared to be holding steady. 1,500 sacks of Jiangxi machine-milled rice were traded at 10.09 yuan to 9.80 yuan, and 290 sacks of machine-milled Yuan rice were traded at 14.60 yuan to 14 yuan. 100 sacks of new South machine-milled rice arrived and were sold at 9.60 yuan. Discussions on the price of imported rice failed, and no transactions took place.</p>
<h3>Forward Flour Seen Approaching 2.30 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening bell, trading in the flour market fluctuated. Because foreign wheat prices had risen from a small value, there were no difference in the price. The market opened lower after the afternoon trading since a batch of foreign wheat had been imported; 2 ships were expected to load and arrive around the 20th. However, since sales were mediocre, a decline would be inevitable. As a result, people lost confidence, anticipating the the market decline to 2.30 yuan. Closing prices showed that the current month fell by 0.01 yuan, November fell by 0.01 yuan, December fell by 0.0125 yuan, January fell by 0.01 yuan, and February/March fell by 0.015 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market: Near Term Firm, Distant Term Weak</h3>
<p>After the opening bell yesterday, trading in the wheat futures market showed near-term firmness and distant-term weakness. Since the current month's inventory was being inspected and problems occurred with goods, the short side continued to cover positions. Wheat had arrived, however, prices were high. Therefore, shorts were unwilling to liquidate positions, causing market sentiment to remain high, reaching a high of 4.74 yuan. The price in November reached 4.64 yuan, but later fell slightly. Short positions were released beginning December, causing market sentiment to weaken. The current month rose 0.03 yuan compared to the previous day, while November was unchanged. December-March was lower by 0.02 yuan. Spot cargo was better by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan, with standard quality increased. 6900 bales of the wheat from Zhumadian, Niuzhuang, Shaoxing, Yaowan were bought by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Hold Firm</h3>
<p>Continued exchange rate increases and strong sales in Yokohoma silk futures have raised export costs. With persistent exchange rate increases, dealers and factories are holding firm. Though sales were still sluggish, market sentiment has trended upward. Yesterday, thirty packages of factory silk came from Anbu. Dachang had ten packages of baiqian. Both were priced high.</p>
<h3>Chuan Han Silk Remains In Abundance in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The current stock of handkerchief silk amounts to 3,000 dan. This year's output remains smooth, while exports to Europe have remained sluggish. This has caused Shanghai holdings to increase dramatically. About 2,000 dan of the silk currently in foreign warehouses includes handkerchief silk from Xi'an, Sichuan, and Jing County. Chinese merchants also have about 1,500 dan. Overseas sales are still sluggish, making a turnaround difficult.</p>
<h3>Tea Market Continues Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market at the foreign firms in this port continued to be quiet. Only the Fu Shi and Yong Xing firms showed some interest in high-grade Zhen Mei green tea. The rest remained in a wait-and-see attitude. There were no large transactions in Zhen Qiang, Xiu Mei, pearl tea, and other items. According to sources from the trade, the inventory in the Moroccan market has not been cleared recently, and there is no hope for market development. Although Russian firms still have a strong interest in buying Gong Xi green tea, their offered prices are too low. Chinese tea merchants are holding firm and unwilling to sell, resulting in very few transactions.</p>
<p>Newly produced orchid seeds from the south have arrived. Orchid seeds were previously in short supply, and the opening price rose by about twenty-five taels. Now, the freshly produced goods have entered the market, and prices have eased slightly. Several dozen boxes arrived a few days ago and were opened yesterday. Those with excellent color and aroma are down by about two taels compared to before, while those of lower quality are not selling even at twenty-three taels. Sales are somewhat sluggish. It is said that more shipments are expected soon, but the market outlook is mediocre.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading volume of Wujin Company's iron was high, reaching over six hundred boxes throughout the city. Due to limited supply, prices have risen sharply. American Kang goods sold for twenty-one taels and seven mace and five candareens, Feng Yu goods for twenty-two taels and two mace and a half, Mitsui goods for nineteen taels and five mace, and Kun He goods for twenty-one taels and two mace and a half.</p>
<h3>Ribbed Steel Falls Another Five Taels</h3>
<p>The price of ribbed steel has been reported in this newspaper previously. However, recently, foreign firms have been selling off their existing stock, causing the standard price to fall another five taels. The price is now estimated at only ninety taels per ton. Feng Tai Xing, Xin Zhong Ji, Gui Lan Ji, and other construction companies have purchased large quantities, totaling over two hundred and eighty tons. It is reported that many are still negotiating for future deliveries. Those holding goods are not currently concerned about having too much stock.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>

<p>Xinyuan Firm announced that citizens in Nanshi (Southern City) and Zhabei (Northern Shanghai) held a large-scale lantern parade on the evening of the day before Double Ten Day (October 10th). No fewer than tens of thousands of people from various organizations, groups, schools, factories, merchants, and shops participated, departing after 6 PM. The onlookers formed a sea of people, creating an extremely lively scene. Among them, the "Double Knife" brand stinky water was especially remarkable, with lanterns crafted into various market scenes and barrel tops, vividly resembling the real products, splendid and dazzling. Moreover, the lower ends of both sides formed a double cross, coinciding with Double Ten Day. Therefore, the audience all praised it highly.</p>
<p>Lao Zheng He Silk Fabric Dyeing Factory on Edward Road, Zhengjia Bridge, announced that their factory has meticulously studied dyeing techniques and science, and is a leader in the Shanghai dyeing industry. They refine and dye silk, woolen fabric, and piece goods, as well as various clothing pieces of damask, silk gauze, and serge, using the latest machinery and scientific refining methods. Therefore, the colors are bright and beautiful, unparalleled. The main components for extraction and dyeing, and the dyes required by the dye department, are mostly purchased wholesale from Shang Da Yanliao (paint and dye) store in Gaoshouli, Hainin Road. The dyes of this store are purely German raw materials, so whatever the texture is dyed, it is guaranteed to be durable and washable, and will never fade. It has earned the trust of society and occupies a leading position in global dyeing technology. Currently, to promote business, they plan to open a letter dyeing department to popularize the trust of sending clothes from other ports for dyeing, to avoid regrets.</p>
<p>The Max Schiessel &amp; Co. Confectionery Company, located below the Great World on Edward Road, announced that since the introduction of the Dongyang vegetable and chicken pot dish starting the day before, those eager to taste exotic flavors have flocked in, and they are overwhelmed. The flavor is particularly good, the price is extremely low, and exquisite chocolate candies are given as gifts. No wonder regular customers praise it endlessly.</p>
<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>Dr. Lin Qinshi's Medical Clinic at No. 6 Guangyuli, Route Dollfus, French Concession, announced that the doctor specializes in throat surgery and is a senior disciple of the famous old doctor Zhong Daosun of Xitang. Numerous villagers in that area have had their health restored by his treatment.

The current consultation fee is temporarily set at $1.20.</p>
<h3>Art News</h3>
<p>Ms. Wang Muxia, a painter, announced that she traveled to Japan during the summer, and once came to Shanghai. She was honored by her fellow writers and artists, who sought her calligraphy and paintings, and gifts were thrown in abundance. However, at that time, she was traveling in a hurry and regretted not being able to reciprocate. Now she has returned to Shanghai and is resuming her artistic pursuits. She will be giving away calligraphy and paintings today, Sunday. Items may be sent to Mr. Liu Yuezhou inside the Jiangnan Evening News office at No. 6 Hainin Road.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>Golden Theatre announced that the movie "The Great War Against the Barbarians" is based on the true story of President Andrew Jackson's conquest of the Creek people in 1822. Amidst a hail of bullets, it is interspersed with the romances of heroes and beauties, filled with intensity and tenderness. This film is being screened for the first time in this city.</p>
<p>The Xifan Film Company stated that the company's most successful production of the year, "Golden Rooster Ridge," took more than six months and cost more than 10,000 taels of gold. Scenery, costumes, props, photography, directing, and acting have all been refined and perfected, making it a successful work among the Shanghai-produced films. The photography team that went to Ningbo to capture outdoor scenes has already returned to Shanghai yesterday. The film has been completely completed and is now being edited. It will be released soon. One of the most exciting scenes in the play is the burning of the Diao family village, which was filmed with a real house burning, making it more valuable than using a model fire.</p>
<p>Yueming Film Company announced that their newly filmed two-part "Female Escort" has been completed. It was test-screened at the company last night. Film merchants from Siam and the Dutch East Indies, who came here to celebrate National Day, visited and recognized the film as being extremely good, catering deeply to the audience's martial spirit, and, like the previous "Kanto Daxia" films, is a masterpiece that will cause a sensation at home and abroad. The third part of "Female Escort" still has several interior scenes that have not yet been filmed, because the scenery is grand and requires extensive work. It will be released soon. Director Ren Pengnian, to expand the business, plans to proceed in two groups, specially adding Wu Tianyou as co-director, and hiring the new novelist Wen Bojiu as the scriptwriter. He has already continued to compile the scripts for the seventh and eighth parts of "Kanto Daxia." The content of the two films will have special interweaving and the latest artistry. Mr. Wen has traveled to England and the United States, studying film in depth, and will definitely make outstanding contributions this time. The leading roles in the two films will still be played by the strongman Xiang and the actress Wu Lizhu.</p>
<p>The World Theatre at the corner of Qingyun Road, Zhabei, announced that since the opening screening of the second part of "Burning Seven Star Tower" by Fulang Film Company the day before (9th), sales have been quite good. Starting today, the company's third part of "Burning Seven Star Tower" will continue to be shown, starring Yang Jingwo and Liang Saizhen. Several scenes of prison breaks and disturbances in the city are extremely lively, such as the demonic nuns and monsters fighting in the air, changing and escaping, and the technology of flying swords and running walls is amazing to watch.</p>
