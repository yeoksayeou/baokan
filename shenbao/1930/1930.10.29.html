<h3>笑一之付</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲—據C先生説他和城中的諸大家都有連帶關係的</p>
<p>乙—不錯電話線的連帶</p>
<p>甲—我近來也在和女子们講愛情了。睜開眼來頓覺一切東西。都變得異樣</p>
<p>乙—這不算希罕你在路上怱怱的走要是一不留心。把你的頭猛撞在電竿上你睜開眼來。也會有這様的感覺。</p>

<h3>公祭惠又光烈士記詳</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>陜西惠又光烈士。逝世迄今。業己三載。近因歸葬故鄉。由于右任等發起公祭予與惠君因公接洽。亦有數次。深佩其人故亦前往參與。茲將是日見聞所及。彙錄如下。</p>
<p>禮堂在檳榔路玉佛寺殿右慈壽堂。門口懸有聯曰。「何處更逢君。憶昔年氣壓千軍。濟濟獨推元龍洒脱無旣。」「有謀終未用。看當時砥柱狂瀾。期期惜祗一夔刦運何如。」旁設簽名簿。來賓簽到後。各贈藍花白帶符號一枚。佩於胸際。壹上以白紙書「惠又光先生之靈位。」供於正中。桌供水菓乾點及花瓶等物。下列花圈六。上懸藍綢金字横額。文曰「永留歷史紀念。想見革命精神。」于右任氏是日穿藍素綢夾衫。領際有紐而不扣。足穿黑鞋白竹布襪褲管垂及脚背完全書生本色。十一時半到後。與各來賓頷首爲禮。遍觀四壁哀輓文字。十二時開祭。由于氏主祭。禮甚簡單。先獻花。繼讀祭文。後行三鞠躬禮與普通公祭時用獻帛獻爵等舊禮。完全不同。祭畢來賓環繞靈前。于氏即站於主祭地位而演説。未啓齒己垂涙。即以左手拭目。第一句即謂惠又光是可憐的革命黨。一生爲革命事業而奔走謹守主義。不畏艱險。膽大志堅。素爲同志所敬佩。所做工作。外人不知者。渠亦不求人知。我行我素。生平從未享過安樂日子。是眞革命之實行家。病危時。對於黨國事業。依舊不釋於懷。家產身家。完全爲革命而犧牲。現歸葬故鄉。較之關中災民垂斃情形。稍勝一籌唉。可憐的革命同志令己蓋棺論定。如是收塲。能不痛惜。言時頻以衣袖拭涙聽衆垂涙者亦不少。繼由孫隆吉述惠先生事略謂惠君受總理命令。由日歸國。擔任陜北革命工作。備嘗艱苦。渠父以及兄與弟。同時殉難。田維勤與惠君反對時咸勸其離鄉暫避。渠因一家人僅剩一妻。伉儷素篤。妻病正危。不忍離家。同志中備馬後。硬拉渠走。始忍涙而行。走後四小時。果來兵百餘將其家包圍幸已先遁。否則殆矣。靖國軍解體時。惠君遇難。將槍斃。仍從容自若。而歌以自矢。有公理公理。守之勿徙。汝使我生。我爲汝死等語。遇救後。依舊奮鬥。毫不畏却。佐建國軍解廣州之圍。總理賴以不死。否則不堪設想。現惠君無子。以姪繼承。家内蕭條不堪。凡我同志。設法相助。是日共到來賓百餘人。各省俱有。内有一妙齡女子。及秃頂和尚。爲人所最注意。誄辭輓聯甚多。不及記憶。茲將最新頴者一文。摘錄如下。「在茫茫的人海中。沉没了一朶光明閃灼的浪花。在滾滾的黄河邊。長眠着一個先知先覺的偉人。呵。他就是惠又光先生。呵。他持着百折不撓的精神奮鬥以至於犧牲。掀起了西北革命的怒潮。驚醒了迷夢中的弱者。先生如今雖是死了。然而血一般的浪花底波濤。仍是在澎湃的洶湧。看。看呀。這就是先生示給我们弱者的光明之路。前進。前進。」一時散會。在大雄寶殿前合攝一影。而赴鹿野堂中膳。菜由寺内承辦。色味俱佳。歸而記此。以誌哀悼。</p>
<h3>圓桌會議考</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>印度之甘地。旣已被捕入獄。而英政府舉行圓桌會議。仍欲請其加入。查此圓桌會議Round　Table名詞。雖常見於報紙。但淵源何自。似亦爲一般人所欲知。不揣謭陋搜索古籍。以作圓桌會議考。</p>
<p>圓桌會議之首創者爲英王亞塞King　Arthur皇於西歷五百二十年。於盤頓山Mount　Badon之戰受傷而卒。則最初舉行圓桌會議。當在距今約一千四百載以前。王幼時即英俊聰慧。迨經貴族選舉入主大位。尤賢明禮士。具武俠風。在宫中與巴魯圖會議。特製一圓桌。席上各人。自由報告。發表意見。據王之意。桌如方長。即有坐位上高下之别惟圓形則大小不分。任何巴魯圖。均一律相視嗣後英國重要會議。或貴族與平民談判。常用圓桌。以示尊重不過圓桌名稱。本爲英國上古一種平等之表示。若在圓桌上討論。仍主張不平等條約是終失却當初創行圓桌之本意也。</p>
<h3>圓子與饅頭</h3>
<p>— 楊一笑</p>
<p>毎届下午四點鐘後。余恒憶及本市三牌樓之抽筋圓子。與邑廟東轅門之南翔饅頭。回首凔桑。不過二十餘年。已令人不勝今昔之感矣。</p>
<p>三牌樓抽筋圓子最著名。製法將菜之筋抽去。斬細。以熬熟猪油拌匀爲餡。復用水磨粉揑成圓子。投入沸水鑊内。將蓋蓋一分鐘撈出。視肉圓子味更鮮美。故買客極多。可稱獨行生意。後因女主人死。店亦閉歇。抽筋圓子遂成廣陵散絕饗矣</p>
<p>邑廟東轅門之南翔饅頭。皮薄而肉餡多湯。老饕爭趨之。朝晚無座不满。毎一出籠。人人爭買。竟有應接不暇之勢。須枯守一二小時。始可一快朶頣。倘逢星期日。則須隔夜豫定。盛極一時。今則但有東轅門。而不復有南翔饅頭店矣</p>
<h3>紀當年之砲臺灣</h3>
<p>— 古頭</p>
<p>吳淞砲臺灣海關燈塔東北隅。在浚浦局未會塡築基地以前。本爲一片汪洋之浦江。江水至此成一大灣曲。折入長江。下流於海。三十年前之老砲臺即建此岸旁。故有砲臺灣之名稱。聞當年老砲臺。工程十分宏固。佔地優勝。而形势雄壯。爲中國唯一之防禦器。亦長江第一道門户。中外船舶出入。莫不視爲要隘。辛丑和約旣成。列强建議迫毀我國大沽砲臺後。英人賄僉壬朦蔽清廷。而一面勾結奸人。不惜巨金。出資收買。吳淞砲臺。從事拆毀。迄今砲臺舊址全無。夷爲平地。無復有當年之雄烈。僅海軍部海岸巡防處大門左側。有二丈餘高之石堆。聳出墙頭。傳爲吳淞老砲臺之遺跡（現由海岸巡防處樹築風象儀器爲毎日觀象測候之用）秋風禾黍。人事滄桑。回首當年。不禁欷歔。</p>
<p>聞在吳淞老砲臺未拆毀前。淞滬鐵路之砲臺灣車站。遠在現時交通部吳淞無線電報局以北。及老砲臺毁。新砲臺成。（即現在獅子林及南北等砲臺）車站設此頗爲不便。乃缩遷於海關燈塔以南。即今時車站址也</p>
<h3>南洋游記（六五）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>瓦城無人力車。馬車亦頗美。價頗廉。與中國不同。一點鐘不過一二角。近者半元亦可。中土則單呌馬車總須一元起碼也。但經濟狀况亦不一例。如印名片一百張。乃需三盾。當中國四元。價約當中國十倍。可怪也。加拉人緬人所作各種飮食點心。均味美。蓋彼人初步智識。只能作此。至於機器。則不懂矣</p>
<p>晚莊海泉君約看緬人電影。其演法亦可觀疑爲西人導演。初次演一俠女。爲其友尋夫。結果旣救其友。自已亦得夫。此類之事。在華女無此思想。在社會活動力亦不能如緬女也。次幕爲緬王護敎事。可考見緬古時宫殿威儀之狀。殊可觀。但緬人之佛敎。總帶迷信性質。吾人不甚願觀之也</p>
<p>有黎子清者。湖南人。在眉描上弄自科地方英人鐵鑛廠作工頭。據言華工在此者。前年有千四五百人。去年减至四五百人。内以雲南人爲多。他省人亦有有時因爭工作而相　云。其工資則毎年只可於陰九月以後四個月中作工。餘時不利。易病。故停工也。四個月内。毎人所得工銀。平常約一百盾云。雲南工人往返二十日。得此亦可小補也。至英人鐵鑛。規模甚大。彼竟不能知其資本若干萬但聞此主人已是第三次經營。前二次之主人均已失敗。可見凡事最後努力爲要也。又該廠本亦出銀。現出鐵。此可證緬甸出產各種鑛均富矣。又森材之利亦年收甚巨。有人業象牙者。問之。北境山林中有野象。土人𤢱之以售也。</p>
<p>雲南王君談大理石。大理石出於大理府。非若此地之白石佛像。又非玉而一種带烏　樹木花紋之文石也。其石天然產。有各種花紋甚美觀。可作屏對及桌面之用。惟性碎難保護。故帶出不易。又其紋非平面而斜紋者。故磨其面不能平正。在雲南本地價値尚廉。若一出境。則甚貴矣。按大理石之花紋。非花也。乃動植物之化石耳。同一物質。中國人不知科學。僅以爲美顴。而不知用一種科學研究。若考查化石。可知地質學。希望地學家生物家礦學家。來西南部大研究。必有大發現也。政府但顧戰爭。何暇顧此。不過若各省政府主席稍有常識。尚應另闢一種常費。對於發明機器。科學文化事業者。資其調查試騐。尚優於但知歛民財以殺人也。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（三○三）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　四廂彈涙惆悵紅情　一座傾心低徊綠意</p>
<p>隊伍開進了房間裏。原預備就要開火的。但是没有得到總司令殷太太的命令。誰也不敢動手。殷太太到底也是一位老將。守着諸葛武侯的「膽欲大而心欲小」的明訓。却也以審愼出之。因想這個地方。究竟是我們老爺的小公館不是。因爲一切器具。都是新置辦的。没有一様作爲認識和證據。但是物證没有。人證是有的。先傳參謀長。那裹知道參謀長大少爺。在樓下什麽地產公司去参觀他们的地產部份去了。再召先遣隊隊長。那個馬車夫根生。知道自己昨天領了。大少爺來。今天東窗事發了。老爺回來了。都要埋怨我。説我自己是個禍根。憑良心上講。老爺和姨太太。常常優待我。錢也多用了他們不少。現在却放了他們的籠。有些説不過去的嗎。這一回。飯碗頭一定不保的了。所以他的先鋒。不敢走到樓上來。只躱在隔壁人家的竃間裹去。但是這事合當破露。太太眼尖手快。却見梳妝台上有一張照片。連忙搶在手裹一看。不是老爺的玉照是誰人的呢。太太喊道。好好。贓證己在這裹了。還有什麽話説。有人道。這話殷太太説差了。證則有之。贓則未也。其實在殷太太心中。這個贓字一點也没有差。東西可以偷。人也何嘗不可以偷。所以女子有了外好。社會上稱之爲偷漢。殷太太想。我好好的一個老爺。却被你偷去了。現在賊證已獲。無可抵頓。總司令當時下了一個動員令。喝了一聲打。那時一班娘子軍。早已磨拳擦掌。等候命令。來的時候。都是徒手兵。現在手中都有了器械。都是就地繳的械。有的是雞毛撣帚。有的是捣衣裳捧杵。有的上帳竿竹。有的到竃下去取了柄火夾。一齊動手。只聽咯啷一響。把伊梳妝台上陳列的各式各樣的香水瓶。以及生髮发水花露水。都打在地上。满房間裹香氣氤氳。只聽乒乓一響。是洪蓮香最新放大的一個照相。玻璃打成了冰花波紋。又聽得豁郎一響。所有面湯檯上的磁面盆磁水壼。都成了粉碎。總之一個房間裹。打成了落花流水。那個時候。幸虧得洪蓮香自己着乖。一點不知和他们反抗。持了個不抵抗主義。要是你要一抵抗。殷太太就耳刮子送上來了。現在太太不動手。那班娘子軍也不好動手。洪蓮香除了哭泣以外。也没有第二個方法。</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論巴黎車展開幕盛况  黄影呆　　巴黎汽車展覽會。己於十月二日正式開幕矣。本届展覽。法國各汽車廠陳列之新車。較往爲多。歐西各國人士。凡關心汽車事業者。莫不遠道前來。相率參觀。種種盛况。不一而足。茲特略述會塲所陳列之新車於後。以吿本刊讀者。　　車身以低矮爲時　當此次法國汽車展覽會。在法國開幕之時。一般汽車界人。參觀之下。咸謂照今日法國各汽車廠。所製一九三一式新車而言。雖無重大之改革。惟當行車之時。在街頭里巷。步行之人。仍不無危險發生。此殆爲一大缺點也。他若華愛星Voisin新車。轎車之頂。頗爲低小。僅及普通人士之腰袋。而我人握手之時。如立於車上。竟可及於車頂之上。亦可謂特殊之新車也。此種新車。我人上車之時。無須跨越。因新車之上。並無踏脚板之装置。而此次在會塲陳列者。亦以此種新車爲最多。華愛星新車。所以有若是之特殊形式者。因製造之時。將底盤之高度减低。他若彈簧螺釘等物。均用倒装之法。故車頂亦因而低矮矣　　底盤形如大吊床　法國新車。本年崇尙低矮。上文己言之矣。然車一矮則推進棍之動作。不無阻碍。故製造之時。改在車身中心點之右側。兩座位兩旁。則另有低凹之處。若是則全無不便矣。如以倫敦之公共汽車。與法國新車相形之下則大小懸殊之甚。不啻有天壤之隔矣。此外有畢克賽里Bucciali新車者。所装引擎。頗多驚人之處。而底盤之中。有集中近心力之鐡管。與各部牽動力均有密切之關係。尤爲特點。車爲前輪拖進式。當行車之時。雖遇任何震力。亦不致使底盤移動。或車輪停止進行。至於車身及底盤。中間一若無明顯之接合。蓋接合方法。不用邊釘。觀其形式。則不啻大吊床一架。上裝車架。故乘客安坐車中。行駛途中之時。一無震盪之苦。此種大吊牀式之新車。會塲之内。陳列者亦不在少數。此種新車。唯一優點。即在行車之時。不拘環境如何。均無震力。其行駛之迅速穩快。堪稱獨步。他若蘭西亞Ｌancia及塔屈拉Ｔatra兩種新車。亦用此法装置。據云畢克賽里。不久將有十六汽缸之新車問世。每邊有汽缸八隻。而速度則每小時可達百哩云　　馬力多至百匹以上　法國新車。近來尙有一種特殊之傾向。即馬力之加多是也。在會塲中陳列之新車。其中馬力在百匹以上者。至少有二十輛。且有特别新車二輛。馬力有一百四十匹之多。是故車身之低矮。即因馬力之加多。他若行車之時。種種附件。亦莫不改進。以免危險之發生。如轉灣之時。以及重心力不準之處。均爲危險之事。而新車均可免之。凡此種種。要皆爲舊車所無。而爲新車所獨有者也　　婦女購車喜漂亮　至於法國各廠。近來製造汽車之時。所用原料。亦日見精美。不能變形之金屬。己不再需要矣而今日所用者。殆皆金光燦爛者。追溯往年。所用金屬。最貴者莫如銀色。而金色金屬。並未見過。故新車之上。如减熱器車燈等物。皆有金光閃射於目光之前。而車身之刷漆。又盡精美之能事。故車身之漂亮美觀。實爲各國所無。法國女子。今日購買汽車者。每以頻色美觀爲主要條件。他如機件之如何。反視爲次要條件也。或則漆成象牙色。或則金黃色。或則數色相間。形如虹霓。一言以蔽之。新車之頻色。極盡美觀。爲我人所意想不到者。仿照英國阿姆雪德蘭及德姆勒之式様。所用齒輪。均可自動。而齒輪變换之法。上有記號。劃於駕駛盤之上。一任駕車人之選擇。尤覺便利無比。法國女子。近來對於駕駛汽車之興趣。較英國女子更甚。即對於汽車學識。不大熟悉者亦每喜駛車途中。而若輩對於漂亮汽車。尤覺歡迎云　　車價低廉推獨步　法國各汽車廠。近來對於汽車事業。旣竭力改進。是故車輛之銷路。亦日見發達。即如小奥斯丁新車而言。式様之新奇。機件之耐用。尤爲令人咋舌。麥賽斯Mercedeo新車。有六部分速之齒輪盒。本年新車之式様。更爲繁多。此種新車。不拘路面如何。均可行駛。祇須駕車之人。擇一齒輪耳。若用第五擋排。則爬山越嶺。更爲適宜。據云此種車輛最合汽車競賽之用英國汽車展覽開幕後。各廠新車。似較往年進步。然美觀之程度。則遠不及法國也。而法國汽車。售價之廉。尤爲他國所不及。如奥斯丁。黑勃。喜爾門。阿姆雪德蘭等。均爲低價汽車也。法蘭西福特及六缸雪鐵龍。售價最低。故銷路亦最廣。試騐雪佛蘭貨車　　英國倫敦公共汽車公司試騐雪佛蘭貨車之長距離行駛能力與其路面行動情形之試騐。底盤中央之小輪即其測量器云汽車宜採用相當之油  筱竹　　許多置有汽車之人。在冬季之時。善用簿油。迨至夏季。則用稍厚之油。此法有時固屬穩妥。但不可作爲普通規則。蓋因此事尙有他項問題應須討論。有數種引擎應用厚油。再有他種引擎宜用薄油。　　汽車引擎大半工作較輕於曳動機車之行擎。蓋在曳動機車上。燃料燃燒較多。並生較大熱力。機油一經烘熱。當即化薄引擎愈熱。則油愈薄。此層極易解决。如油可以循環流行。則用稍厚之油於熱引擎上。故在選用機油之時。應須注意此層。有數種加油系不宜採用厚油　　熱引擎採用厚油雖屬相當。但厚油用於冷引擎上。或爲大誤。在平常工作之時如汽缸四壁加油適當。則一部份機油時常流過活塞。如其燃燒純潔。當無困難可生。否則或將變爲打油帮浦。並有於積物之發生。熱引擎可將厚油燃去。但冷引擎則不然　　引擎運行之冷熱。令特其工作及構造情</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>形。而其對於炭積物之感觸與否。則賴壓縮及他種情形。機油之體質。應有封閉活塞完美之能力。此事全恃活塞空隙。彈簧速度。以及他項要素。　　置有汽車之人不能精細分析此種連帶關係之要素。故當採用著名油行推薦之油如本埠光裕機器油行所售之茄高兒牌汽車油。因其深悉引擎構造情形。以及油之性質。而乃製成此油。以配需要。優等機油之服務。非常重要。油質必須適當。並用於相甚地點。方得收效。消息兩週間汽車肇禍記  三原　　日期　　　地址　　　汽車號碼　受傷人　　傷勢　　　最後情形　　十五日　　西新橋口　四七八八　鄉農某甲　重傷　　　由車夫出以五元　　十六日　　文廟路　　一八七一　徐姓女孩　重傷身死　將車夫拘辦　　十七日　　中華路　　某號　　　蕭廷邦　　重傷　　　同右　　十八日　　中興路　　某號　　　張品山　　足部受傷　送院醫治　　十九日　　民國路　　脚踏汽車　李明道　　左足微傷　同右　　二十日　　愛多亞路　兩車互撞　人力車夫　手背擦傷　由人私解了事　　二十一日　方斜路　　脚踏汽車　賈姓女孩　碾傷右膝　將車夫拘辦　　二十二日　外灘　　　某號　　　張泰成　　重傷身死　由車夫賠損失　　二十三日　河南路　　某號　　　張德賢　　同右　　　候傳核辦　　二十四日　八仙橋　　一一○號　撞倒崗亭　微毁　　　由捕報告核辦　　二十五日　卡德路　　四八三九　某姓老嫗　頭部重傷　送院醫治　　二十六日　北蘇州路　脚踏汽車　二法人　　均受重傷　同右　　二十七日　外灘　　　同右　　　三西人　　各受重傷　同右　　二十八日　梧州路　　某號　　　李金山　　足部輕傷　同右　　兩週間之汽車肇禍。共有十四起。内因重傷身死者。計男子二人。女孩一人。重傷者。男子二人。法人二名。西人三名。足受傷者。男子四人。女孩二名。雜錄駕駛汽車一得  戴欲仁　　余性好動。喜研究動的學術。而於汽車。則尤喜駕駛。先從事室内研究。旣明車内機械之組織。乃即從事於駕駛練習爰就所得。述之如左。或亦可爲練習駕駛者之一助乎　　一、須鎭定不可慌亂。則精神清醒遇危險時。措置自如。不致無所措手。　　二、在十字路口及轉灣處，須按喇叭數響。俾來往車輛。不致互撞。　　三前面如遇牲畜。如馬狗等。最好預先設法讓避。不可在靠近時放響笛。因此等牲畜。一聞背後猛烈怪聲。必致驚駭狂跳。此時即難於讓避。塞車不及。勢必遇險。　　四、眼須前視。注意路上。對於排車。響笛。風門等健。須預先諳熟。不可臨時喜用較長時間之目力。致不能顧及前路之注意力。　　五、大轉灣後。注意駕駛盤。不可退回過度。否則車將撞上路沿。　　六、轉灣處須慢車待車己轉灣。再增加速率。否則恐遇碰撞及車有傾斡之虞。汽車上多少橡皮  枕月　　汽車週刊提出提論　竟達六十五件之多　　一個有趣味的問題。在美國汽車周刊引起了讀者濃厚的興趣。　　問題是「一輛汽車上要用多少橡皮。」自然啦。人人可以知道的。有車胎。脚踏板等等。然而誰又想到。一輛汽車上竟有用得着橡皮的。達六十五件之多呢。這次。週刊社的主筆。趁着美國材料試騐委員會開會。見了一位美國橡皮公司工程師凱士氏。當他毫不遲疑說出六十五件之後。大家不覺一呆。他的話是這様的。「近代工業中。惟有橡皮是汽車的好友。一切全屬安置的地方。全有橡皮維護着。譬如安置機器的底層。多半是橡皮。其餘如汽車地板上。邊綠。車底。無處用不到橡皮。還有間接的。例如橡樹的汁來做的紙。使用在汽車上的狠多。原因是爲了它能防禦潮濕。車窗玻璃的溝道。也是用橡皮來鑲綴的。防止震動設備。也是利賴橡皮座的。　　六十五件如果細細分析想來。便狠有趣味了。這些是車長擋車内胎車外胎輪擋風扇溝火花軸機器架地氈絕緣電綫駕駛機輪風扇帶車頭燈車操加速度鈕喇叭鈕蓄電池匣散熱器帽震動吸收機水力制動部車窗溝頂燈架。踏脚板。……以上都是採其重要的。其餘小件。更不下數十。總之。橡皮對於汽車最大貢獻。第一能吸收震動。第二制止大聲。第三避免金屬器互撞。第四絕緣電流」。　　六十五件橡皮用件。是以一九三○年車爲標準的。因爲汽車對於橡皮的需要逐漸的殷切。以後恐怕所需用的。還示止此呢。愛山克司挑戰號新車　　此新式愛山克司「挑戰號」大轎車。自水箱至後擋。今均新式。别緻入時之車身廓線與裝修豐美之車廂内部。尤使新愛山克司爲創舉而享受榮譽之汽車。車身因底盤增闊更大。三人並座。毫不擠軋。反覺座墊之温柔適意。至於動作之敏捷。更因其新引擎而强盛專件英華汽車名詞錄（三六）  丁祖澤　　　　Rearlight後澄尾燈　　Rearwdeel後輪　　Rebabbiting重澆軸承　　　Reboring重刮光内徑（汽缸）　　Recharging重充電　　Recip　　Rocating往復運動　　Rectiher改流機　　Refacing刮面重换裹面料　　Retlector反照鏡反光鏡　　Regrinding重麿　　Regulator限制器限制機　　Relay限電器　　Reliefcock排泄門　　Relining重换裹面料　　Remagnetizing重加磁（電）　　Remeshing　magneto重嚙合磁電機　　Remodeling重改式様　　Remove移開拆開　　Rerpair修理　　Repairman修理人　　Repairshop修理舖修理廠　　Replacement替代物　　Reseeting重修座　　Reserve　tank副箱預備箱（汽油箱）　　Resistance電阻　　Resistancecoil電阻綫圈　　Resistance　unit電阻組　　Retainet承盤　　Retard遲缓（電氧點火）遲點火　　Return　wiRe返綫　　Reverso退行倒行　　Reverse　curRentcut　out倒流阻止機限電機　　Reversegear倒退倒行齒輪　　Revesible　steering　gear可逆動轉向機　　Revoing　cylind　engine迴轉汽缸發動機　　Revlutins　per　minuteRbeostat電阻器　　Ricardociylnderbead利卡度汽缸頭　　Rich　mixtuRe濃混合汽　　Right　hand　concRolcar右御車　　Right　side右側（詳Rigbt　side）　　Rim輪環　　Rimbolt輪環螺絲釘　　Rim　cut輪環切傷（車胎）　　Rim　wedg輪環劈　　Rim　wRench輪環螺絲比扳　　Ring　gear外圈齒輪（飛輪）　　Rivet帽釘　　Riveting釘帽釘帽（動字）　　Road　clearance架高空隙（底盤離開路面之距離）　　Road　Rule道路規則　　Road　sign道路記號　　Rocker搖桿　　Rod桿條　　Roller棍圓柱　　Rollerbearing棍軸承　　Rotary　cylinder　engine迴轉汽缸發動機　　Rotary　thRottlevalve迴轉喉門　　Rotary　type　circulation　watal　pump迴轉式水喞筒　　Rotary　valve迴轉汽門　　Rotor迴轉物·轉柄·轉子　　Rotor　of　distributor分電盤轉柄·分電　　Rotor　of　magneto磁電機電樞　　R·P·M即Revolutions　ferminute之縮字每分鐘若干轉　　Running　board登車堦　　Running　cost行車費用　　Running　gear驅進機械　　Running　in磨合　　Running　in　bearing　in　oil油浸磨合軸承　　　Running　in　machine磨合機</p>

<h3>The Future of World Warfare</h3>
<p>The more advanced the world, the more warfare should decrease. This is the ideal of man. However, according to reality, it is impossible to be so. What is the reason for this? Is the evolution of the world not at a sufficient level? Or is the common sense of progress and reducing warfare not entirely true? Is there a limit to the knowledge of the world's human beings, with the foolish gradually becoming wise and the wise gradually becoming wiser? Or is there no limit? This is a question. If there is a limit, then although there are differences in the knowledge of the world's human beings today, they will eventually converge on the same level. If there is no limit, then the inequality of human beings will be difficult to eliminate even if human efforts are exhausted, and the segregation of classes will eventually be difficult to eliminate. According to the former theory, warfare should naturally cease in the most advanced era of the world's human beings, but in the process of progress, warfare will increase due to the knowledge being in a state of ebb and flow. According to the latter theory, the classes of knowledge will always have differences, then the principle of controlling and being controlled will always exist, and the injustices of the world will never be avoided, then the warfare in the world will never cease. My speculation is not without reason. The aborigines in the mountains of Taiwan are now raising flags to revolt, and the European countries are preparing for war as if they intended to fight. Their momentum cannot be dispelled by empty words. The reason for this is worth considering deeply. Domestic Important Telegrams Two: Japanese Police in Longjing Village Wantonly Harass</p>

<h3>National Government Orders China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Become State-Owned</h3>
<p>Nanjing National Government Order of the 28th: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the oldest shipping institution established in our country, but due to poor management and rampant corruption, it is on the verge of bankruptcy. Previously, this government sent personnel to reorganize it and formulated regulations to organize a committee to supervise and guide its operations, but after years of operation, it has made little progress. Without fundamental reform, it is impossible to save the shipping administration and comfort the public. Now, the bureau is taken back into state ownership for thorough rectification to seek the unification of the shipping administration and promote the development of the shipping industry. All matters related to the liquidation of shares and debts, etc., are requested by the reorganization committee to promptly draft a method and submit it for approval and implementation.

<h3>Signing Ceremony of the Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Held at the British Foreign Office</p>
<p>Representatives of Britain, America, and Japan</p>
<p>Deliver Radio Speeches</p>
<p>London, 27th (Reuters): The London Naval Treaty between Britain, the United States, and Japan was signed today at the British Foreign Office. The ceremony was simple. Prime Ministers of various British overseas autonomous territories attended the meeting. British Prime Minister MacDonald, along with Foreign Secretary Henderson and others, welcomed the representatives of the signatory countries. MacDonald, because the ambassadors of France and Italy also came to observe the ceremony, spoke to express his pleasure and hoped that the governments of France and Italy would also approve the Naval Treaty in the future. The United States signed this treaty with the understanding that there are no secret documents modifying the provisions of the treaty. The speeches of the U.S. President, the British Prime Minister, and the Japanese Prime Minister were transmitted everywhere from Washington to London via transatlantic telephone and from the U.S. to Japan via transpacific shortwave radio.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Reuters): When the London Naval Treaty was formally signed at the British Foreign Office yesterday, the speeches made by President Hoover in Washington and British Prime Minister MacDonald in London were transmitted from radio broadcasting stations and could be heard clearly here. Washington, 27th (Associated Press): Today is the day for the United States, Britain, and Japan to deliver their ratification documents for the London Naval Treaty. The American broadcasting station specially connected with various countries around the world to broadcast the ceremony. The result of the broadcast was extremely satisfactory. The speech delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Hamaguchi in Tokyo was very clear to the major countries of the world. The transmission was first carried out by shortwave from Japan to the United States, and then from the United States to London, and then distributed to other countries. The United States also broadcast the speech widely across the country. The United States delivered a speech by President Hoover, and Britain delivered a speech by Prime Minister MacDonald in London.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi's speech: The establishment of the arms reduction treaty is a great historical undertaking that proves the trust and friendship of the participating countries. The success of all countries in eliminating competition in auxiliary ships and restricting the activities of submarines can be said to have swept away the world's unease and taken a step towards the lofty ideal of world peace. As Prime Minister of the Japanese government, I am deeply honored to have made a contribution, and I sincerely hope that the establishment of the London Treaty will be a turning point for all countries to cooperate with each other and realize coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Speech: Since the Washington Conference of 1922 restricted battleships and aircraft carriers, the London Conference is the first arms reduction agreement of this kind. This meeting was once difficult to establish, but thanks to the efforts of the representatives of the three countries and the people of various countries, it was finally achieved. Looking back on the dangers and difficulties that have passed, I cannot help but feel emotional. The establishment of the London Treaty is sufficient to show the depth of goodwill and friendship between countries, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in international history.</p>
<p>Hoover's Speech: The London Treaty has extremely important significance. It took eighteen months to complete. I am extremely pleased that the countries involved were able to overcome many difficulties, restrain competition in world naval power, and establish world security. The life of this treaty lies in the expectation that naval competition will naturally disappear in the future. I also sincerely hope that all countries will work together to promote the great spirit of this treaty.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Dentsu): U.S. Secretary of State Stimson sent a congratulatory telegram to Prime Minister Hamaguchi today to celebrate the London Arms Reduction Broadcast. Hamaguchi also returned a telegram in response. Stimson's telegram is as follows: To His Excellency Hamaguchi, Prime Minister of Japan's Tokyo Cabinet: In order to make the London Naval Treaty's ratification ceremony meaningful, it is an honor to hear important broadcasts from Japan. I express my deepest congratulations on this. The U.S. President also agrees with me on the lofty significance and purpose of Your Excellency's speech. We firmly believe that this broadcast can achieve great results.</p>
<h3>Indigenous Uprising in Taiwan</h3>
<p>Destroying the Wushe Police Station</p>
<p>Military Suppression is Difficult</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Japan Union): The Japanese Ministry of the Army received a telegram from a certain location stating that 1,500 aborigines in the Wushe area of Taichung Prefecture, Taiwan, suddenly attacked various outposts on the evening of the 27th and completely destroyed them. Currently, reconnaissance is only being carried out by aircraft, and there is no other way. At the request of the governor of Taichung, a squadron was dispatched to the area on the 28th.

The Ministry of Colonial Affairs immediately issued a notice to the Ministry of the Army, and information is being received from time to time. It is heard that a battalion of troops commanded by the regimental commander is necessary to suppress the uprising. Tokyo, 28th (Dentsu): Regarding the rebellion of the aborigines in Wushe, Taichung Prefecture, Taiwan, later news obtained by the Japanese Ministry of the Army stated that from the reconnaissance of the aborigine villages, Wushe aborigines raised aborigine flags in preparation for battle. Since the outbreak of the incident, Taichung has sent 120 infantry soldiers and several police officers to Puli Society to quickly suppress the uprising. Wushe is located in central Taiwan, with various tribes and aborigines scattered around the mountains. There are police substations, postal delivery offices, hotels, and other Japanese residences, approximately 30 households. The most dangerous aspect of the aborigine rebellion is the Puli Society, located six miles west of the area. Reinforcement troops are scheduled to arrive around 6:00 PM today. Aborigines have attempted to attack the area several times since yesterday afternoon. Puli Society is the location of the Nagao County office. Until the 13th year of Taisho, a company of infantry was stationed there. Afterwards, they were withdrawn due to the peace of the aborigines.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Dentsu): The Japanese Ministry of the Army has decided to allow Watanabe, the commander of the Taiwan Army, to handle everything regarding the rebellion of the Taichung aborigines in Taiwan. It is unlikely that it will escalate into a major incident. Approximately 140,000 aborigines live scattered in mountainous and forest areas. The cause of this rebellion is still unknown. Recently, construction of the Sun Moon Lake hydroelectric power storage reservoir was restarted, and there was a proposal to relocate aborigines from the water source area, which may have led to this misunderstanding and incident.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Reuters): A report from Taiwan states that aborigines in the central Taichung Prefecture (transliteration) area have rebelled and attacked police stations, killing many people. It is heard that the authorities are currently mobilizing to suppress the uprising. The Ministry of the Army later received an official report stating that aborigines in Taiwan attacked a certain police station and annihilated the personnel in the station. A company of infantry from Taichung has rushed to suppress the uprising and dispatched an aircraft for reconnaissance. It is extremely difficult to transport troops to the affected area because there are no roads, and it is difficult to attack due to the mountainous and forested terrain. The Ministry of the Army later received detailed reports stating that several police stations were completely destroyed and the personnel in the stations were killed. The aborigines revolted yesterday morning, cutting telephone lines, destroying several police stations, and looting. The aircraft reported that the aborigines had already unfurled flags. It is heard that there are approximately 1,500 aborigines in total, and approximately 100 Japanese police rifles have been looted.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Reuters): The aborigine uprising in Taiwan coincided with the holding of a sports meeting in the area. It is heard that approximately 190 Japanese people were killed, including 28 girls.</p>
<h3>Opening of the British Parliament</h3>
<p>First Participation of the Labour Government</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters): Today, the Labour government's participation in the formal opening ceremony of Parliament is a first in history. The Labour Party's inauguration in 1924 was after the words of the Conservative Party members answering the King were rejected, and last year, the King's illness prevented him from going to Westminster, so the ceremony did not take place. Today, the King and Queen drove from Buckingham Palace to the Parliament. Along the road were heavily guarded nobles, including Henderson, formerly a carpenter on a ship and now Home Secretary, and Smith, formerly a London streetcar driver and now Home Office Accountant.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Spirit Unfaded</h3>
<p>Sixty Years Old, Strong Physique</p>
<p>Can Still Lead the Revolution for Many Years</p>
<p>London News: A few months ago, Indian revolutionary leader Gandhi was arrested and imprisoned by the Indian authorities for violating the Salt Law. People feared that the sixty-year-old revolutionary would not be able to endure the hardships of prison and that his life might be in danger. The government also had this concern, so when he was arrested, a local famous doctor was specially ordered to examine his physique to see if he could live in prison. According to Dr. Modo, a close friend and doctor of Gandhi, Gandhi is old but his spirit has not faded, and his physique is quite strong. He will be able to lead his revolutionary masses for many years to come (World)</p>
<p>London, 27th (Reuters): The Indian government reported on the situation in India for the week ending October 24, saying that the National Congress was still inciting in North Xia Hua. Reports from various provinces in the first half of October indicated that the overall situation had not changed, and the power of the non-violent resistance movement was gradually diminishing. The hearts of the people in Madras Province were gradually stabilizing. The number of criminal cases in the United Provinces did not continue to decrease. The movement to exclude foreign goods was in an uncertain state. Currently, many provinces are openly selling coarse cloth. The economic situation in Mumbai is better than before, and the number of unemployed factory workers has greatly decreased.</p>
<h3>European War Crisis</h3>
<p>France and Italy are actively preparing for war on the border</p>
<p>Maintaining peace has the opposite effect</p>
<p>Mussolini Criticizes France Covertly</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (National News Agency): Tomorrow is the anniversary of the March on Rome by the Fascist Party. Tonight, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech at the Fascist Party Congress in the Palazzo Venezia, warning the Italian people to pay attention to the enemy and calling for sympathy for revising the peace treaty. His speech mainly discussed Italy's domestic and foreign affairs. It is expected that the ideas and methods of Fascism will eventually be extended to the whole of Europe because Fascism itself has universal qualities and is as universal as the principles of the world. When Mussolini took the stage, the audience applauded thunderously. His opening remarks stated that we should now use the slogan I set in 1925 as a guide. This slogan is that all power belongs to the Fascist Party. He then stated that there are two major factions in the world today, whose ideas and methods are different from each other, but they are enemies of Fascism in every way. In my speeches in Livorno, Florence, and Milan, I exposed a part of Europe's masks. These people like to pretend to be great and deceive people. At the Geneva Conference, they solemnly swore to maintain peace, but in reality, they are preparing for war everywhere, even to the point of distorting my speech and falsely accusing it of declaring war in order to destroy the name and credibility of Fascism and cover up their狂熱 of preparing for war. Mussolini paused for a moment at this point, then held a book high above his head and shouted loudly, "Gentlemen, please look at this! This is a diary of the various war preparations you have made against Italy in the past four years. All the treaties and fortifications and armaments used to plot against us are recorded here."</p>
<p>Therefore, I did not hesitate to warn the people of the whole country some time ago, and today I will warn them again. All my compatriots must know that ill feelings towards Italy are being systematically spread every day, and the crisis of war is also expanding day by day. These people naturally want to shift this responsibility to Italy, falsely accusing it of being militaristic and calling it a brutal wolf in a flock of sheep. In short, the stronger Fascism becomes, the more the anti-Fascist alliance will advance. However, the meaning of Fascism is that it is 利不遷就 in order to seek compromise, it does not deceive people, nor does it threaten people. When others complete their armaments, Italy will also increase its armaments to the same level. Only when others disarm will Italy also disarm. Furthermore, Italy's support for weak countries and its advocacy for revising the peace treaty are not only of great benefit to Italy, but the whole world will benefit from it. This kind of demand for revising the peace treaty is not the words of irresponsible people, because the charter of the League of Nations already has such provisions. Those who use glib tongues to accuse those who advocate revising the peace treaty of violating the League of Nations charter are actually calling a stag a horse. They must know that those who create two classes of armed countries and countries without self-defense in Geneva and strive to maintain the status quo forever are actually violating the League of Nations charter. Finally, Mussolini elaborated on the international secret struggle between the Fascist Party and the anti-Fascist Party, predicting that Fascism will win the final victory and denying that Fascism is an export product of Italy. His concluding remarks were, "The Fascist Party is now moving towards a bright future. Nothing in the world can stop its progress." After the speech, applause thundered, but when Mussolini's speech alluded to France, the applause was even more violent.</p>

<h3>Mutiny of Brazilian Soldiers and Police Quickly Suppressed</h3>
<p>Bombing of the German Ship Incident</p>
<p>Authorities Promise to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 27th (Reuters): Today, the sound of rifles and machine guns was loud in the city. Residents suspected that a counter-revolution had broken out and closed their doors. It was later learned that a part of the soldiers and police had mutinied and rushed into the police station. The army quickly surrounded it with obstacles to block its exit and bombed the rebels with airplanes. Order was restored in less than two hours. More than 100 people were killed or injured. Hamburg, 27th (Reuters): The captain of the Baden, a ship of the Hamburg-America Line, reported to the head office that the ship had departed from Rio de Janeiro with a special permit from the port official, flying its flag at half-mast to pay tribute to the warships and forts, and sounding its whistle loudly when passing the forts. Unexpectedly, a shell flew over and destroyed its mizzenmast. A total of 26 people were killed and 43 injured on board. Official sources: The Brazilian authorities have given a firm guarantee to the German ambassador that they will do their best to investigate the matter and punish those responsible. Berlin, 27th (Reuters): A dispatch from Rio de Janeiro stated that the report that the captain of the Baden had been detained was not true. After repairs, the ship was still commanded by the original captain and sailed out of Rio de Janeiro. Soviet Russian Desert Area</p>
<h3>Successful Irrigation Experiment</h3>

<p>Many Birds and Animals from Neighboring Towns Come to Live</p>
<p>Coal and Iron Production Increased Sharply This Year</p>
<p>Moscow, 27th (National News Agency): The Soviet Union's experiment in irrigating the Karakun Desert in Central Asia in the hope of turning it into a cotton-producing area has proven to be successful.

<h3>The Crux of the British Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>Lies in the Food Tax Issue</p>
<p>London, 27th (Reuters): New Zealand Prime Minister Forbes spoke to guests at the end of this week, saying that we are currently adrift and do not know where we are going. All problems are contained in the difficult issue of food taxes. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden stated that there would be no taxes on food, otherwise it would not be possible to proceed. Therefore, the entire issue of preferential treatment is tied to changes in the British parliamentary system. The British government has now adopted the Chancellor's attitude towards preferential tax rates, so there is no hope for real progress. The above remarks were used by the newspapers owned by Beaverbrook to promote the competition for the Paddington by-election. The Evening Standard claimed that Forbes had swept away the quota distribution proposals put forward by Baldwin and MacDonald. When the Imperial Producers' Association hosted representatives of the Imperial Conference in London, Overseas Autonomous Territories Minister Thomas expressed his deep dissatisfaction with the newspapers' provocations, saying that the Prime Ministers of the Autonomous Territories came to London not as politicians, but as representatives of the Autonomous Territories to discuss and jointly solve the difficulties encountered by the British Empire. He did not believe that there were any conflicts in their feelings for the Empire at the Imperial Conference. He himself did not want to abandon this feeling, but if the provocation did not stop, he feared that there would be a danger of abandoning feelings.</p>
<h3>Estimated Number of Unemployed People in the World</h3>

The U.S. government has now agreed to return them. Today, the German ambassador to the United States will publish advertisements in newspapers and use wireless telephones to notify the original depositors to go and collect them. If they have not been collected by the end of March next year, the funds will still belong to the Treasury. Important Domestic News</p>
<h3>92nd Meeting of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 92nd meeting on the 28th. Those present were Yi Peiji, Jiang Menglin, Wang Boqun, and Ma Fuxiang. Those attending as observers were Li Jinlun, Zheng Hongnian, Zhang Wohua, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, and Yun Shenghai. Secretary General Lv Bichou chaired the meeting. The matters discussed were as follows: 1. The Ministry of the Interior submitted a report approving the Shandong Provincial Government's consultation stating that Yantai has special circumstances in terms of diplomacy, transportation, politics, and commerce, and it seems that a city should be established directly under the provincial government. After investigation, the total population of Yantai mentioned in the original consultation is less than 200,000, and license fees, land taxes, etc. have not been opened, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the City Organization Law. Moreover, Yantai is a seaport and not a political and commercial center as mentioned in the original consultation, which is also inconsistent with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 1 and Article 3 of the City Organization Law. Since it has not yet reached the level of establishing a city, it seems inappropriate to directly establish a city. The question is whether the proposal is appropriate. The resolution was to follow the Ministry of the Interior's proposed plan. 2. The Ministry of the Navy requested the appointment of Shi Guoxian as the second-class lieutenant commander of the Jiangyuan warship, Zhang Rizhang as the second-class lieutenant commander of the Lianjing warship, Cheng Meixian as the first-class major commander of the Jiankang warship, Li Baoqi as the first-class major staff officer of the Naval Torpedo Squadron Command, Zheng Dachen as the first-class major deputy commander of the Tongji warship, Huang Yiyan as the first-class major engineer officer of the Haichou warship, and Sa Shijun as the major commander of the Qingtian survey ship. The resolution was to transfer the report to the government for appointment. 3. The Ministry of the Navy reported that Song Jianxun, lieutenant colonel of the Repair and Construction Section of the Naval Affairs Department, and Li Jiheng, major of the Materials Section, had left their posts without permission and requested that they be dismissed from their posts. It was also proposed to appoint Wu Jiayi to fill the vacancy of major of the Medical Section of the Military Affairs Department, Xie Zinian to fill the vacancy of major of the Armaments Section of the Ordnance Department, and promote Lieutenant Yu Que of the Merit and Reward Section of the Military Balance Department to fill the vacancy of major. The question was whether this was appropriate. The resolution was to transfer the report to the government for appointment and dismissal. 4. The Ministry of the Interior requested the transfer to the National Government of the dismissal of Du Zhaohong, Wang Yi, Chen Chongde, and Chen Da, all recommended secretaries of the ministry, and the appointment of Zhao Ji, Shi Weixiao, Hu Chengli, and Xu Chuanyou to fill the vacancies. The resolution was to transfer the report to the government for appointment and dismissal. 5. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce proposed that Bao Zhiye, chief of the Commercial Affairs Section of the Commercial Affairs Department, had been assigned to another post. It was found that Sun Pu, a member of the Committee for the Discussion of Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations, could succeed him. It was requested to transfer the report to the National Government for separate appointment and dismissal. The resolution was to transfer the report to the government for appointment and dismissal. 6. The Jiangsu Provincial Government requested the appointment of Yi Tingjian as a recommended technician of the Department of Agriculture and Mining. The resolution was to transfer the report to the government for appointment.</p>
<h3>Chen Xingya Takes Over Beiping Military Police</h3>
<p>Northeast Military Police Commander Chen Xingya led the Northeast Third and Fourth Battalions of military police, departing from Shenyang last night, inspecting the military police along the way. This morning (20th) at 2:30 AM, they passed through Tianjin. The Northeast Fourth Battalion of military police disembarked in Tianjin. Around 9:00 AM, the Beiping military police and many Northeast military police, led by the commander of the Northeast First Battalion, Ma Hongtu, went to the station to provide security. Wang Gongxin, the deputy of the Beiping Military Police Command, led all personnel and more than 20 bureau chiefs from Beiping City to the station to welcome them. At 10:50 AM, the special train arrived at the station. After Chen alighted from the train and exchanged greetings with the welcomers, he immediately ordered Cheng Guangdao, the adjutant of the Northeast Military Police Command, to go to the military police department to handle the takeover matters. On the other hand, he led his entourage, including Ren Zhenya, Gao Yuanze, and Li Jingtian, to his residence for a short rest. At 3:00 PM, he drove directly to the military police department for roll call and incorporation. First, Wang Gongxin, the former deputy of the department, reported, saying, "Commander Chen has now been ordered to come to Beiping. From now on, the military police in Beiping City have someone to rely on. I hope that everyone will continue to work hard under Commander Chen's command." Then, Chen gave a speech, saying, "This commander has been ordered by Zhang, the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, to come to Beiping to incorporate the military police of Beiping and Tianjin. I have found that the Beiping military police were founded by this commander in the early years of the Republic. Most of the current officers and soldiers are my old subordinates. Today, it is a great pleasure to reunite with old friends. The origins and system of the Chinese military police have been subject to the ups and downs of political tides. After changes from the early years of the Republic to the tenth year of the Republic, although the Chinese political situation has undergone several vicissitudes, the military police organization system has always been able to maintain its integrity. During these ten years, the changes in the Beiping military police organization that we can recall include the renaming from Jingji Military Police to Gongwei Military Police, then to Jingshi Military Police, and then to the Military Police Enforcement Office of the Military Police. In addition, there are the so-called Border Defense Military Police. Although the names have changed repeatedly, the system can be said to be the same. From the sixth to the tenth year of the Republic, this commander completed the military police unification plan with the greatest effort. After the tenth year of the Republic, national affairs became turbulent and political disputes intensified. The military police organization system was shaken and declined, and the spirit of service also became increasingly sluggish due to the impact of the political tide. I am filled with endless regrets when I think about the past and present. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, when Commander Yu was in office, the department was in dire straits in terms of salaries and equipment. The Beiping City military police had further changes after the Northeast army returned to Shenyang last time. This time, everyone has been able to serve diligently and maintain peace in the area during the transitional period of political changes, which shows that everyone can uphold the honor of the department and fulfill the duty of the department. This commander deeply appreciates this. This incorporation will be handled in accordance with the established regulations of the Northeast Military Police Command. In terms of treatment, it will be the same as the original Northeast military police, treating everyone equally without discrimination. I hope that everyone will work together to invigorate their spirits, serve the country, and create benefits for the local area. This commander has high hopes," and so on. After the speech, Chen returned to his residence at No. 1 Jizhiwei. The Northeast Third Battalion is stationed inside the Beiping Military Police Command.</p>
<h3>Liu Jianxu's Opinions on Pacifying Pingxiang and Liuyang</h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The counties of Pingxiang and Liuyang have long been infested with bandits, and the communist bandits Peng and Huang have always used these two places as their bases. Recently, the county seat of Liuyang has been recovered by Bai Shinuo, the head of the security regiment, and the county seat of Pingjiang was also recovered by the Hou Pengfei Brigade of the 15th Division on the 22nd. However, although the county seats of the two counties have been recovered, bandits are still everywhere in the surrounding countryside, waiting to be cleared. Because of the special situation in the two counties, He Jian has specially established the Pingxiang and Liuyang Pacification Office, with Liu Jianxu, the commander of the 28th Army, as the director, specializing in all matters of suppression and pacification. All military and civilian officials and local forces in Pingxiang and Liuyang are under the command and dispatch of the Pacification Office. Because Liu Jianxu believes that the pacification plan is extremely important, he has specially drafted six articles of opinions on pacification and presented them to He Jian for review. He completely adopted Liu's proposals. Liu is now actively proceeding to formally establish the Pacification Office on the first day of next month and begin handling all matters. The articles of Liu's statement are recorded as follows: 1. I, Liu Jianxu, am a clumsy and mediocre person who has mistakenly taken on military duties. I am deeply ashamed of my lack of talent. Recently, I was appointed as the director of the Pingxiang and Liuyang Pacification Office. At this time of urgent bandit suppression, I will try my best, but I am still afraid that I will not be able to succeed. Moreover, with my sickly body, how dare I take on such arduous tasks? However, I think that you, my lord, are diligent and hardworking, exhausting your efforts to govern. I am honored to receive your instructions and should serve you. If I refuse, it will be seen as cowardice, and if I take care of it, I am afraid that I will not be able to do it well. I am deeply worried that I will fail to live up to your expectations. I have found that the bandit disasters in Pingxiang and Liuyang are the worst in other regions, and the task of pacification is not easy to plan. Now, I will present my shallow views, hoping that you will make a decision. Since the Communist Party disturbed Hunan, the hearts of the people in society have mostly been anesthetized by them. The bandit nests in Pingxiang and Liuyang are especially deeply poisoned, and countless people blindly follow and are coerced. This is because the masses have no organization and the groups are not firm and clear about self-defense, which has led to a widespread disaster. This time, when our army advances to suppress bandits, we should also pay attention to organizing the masses at the same time, establishing more volunteer teams to support the army. If the military and civilians unite to suppress bandits, it will be easier to achieve results. However, to awaken the masses, we must carry out widespread propaganda. It is proposed that the relevant departments obtain from the provincial government and the provincial party headquarters to dispatch political workers, about ten people, to follow the army to carry out propaganda of party principles. I am afraid that the area is vast and the experience is difficult to cover, so it is appropriate to make the local people jointly responsible for the propaganda. If there are not enough men to choose, women can be appointed. Since the local dialects are not separated, the influence is easier to achieve. If the belief in the party principles is firm, they will not be confused by heresies. In the future of pacification, it can be achieved with half the effort. This is the first thing that should be requested. 2. The terrain of Pingxiang and Liuyang is dangerous, and transportation is inconvenient. Transportation is always slow and commands are often delayed. There are many obstacles, which are feared by strategists. It is proposed that you, my lord, order the Highway Bureau to complete the Pingxiang and Liuyang roads in the shortest possible time. As for telephone lines, please order them to be repaired and prepared according to the marching route. With convenient transportation, bandit suppression can be expected to be quick, and pacification will be easier to promote. This is the second thing that should be requested. 3. Pingxiang and Liuyang are the nests of the Communist bandits, who use mountain caves to appear and disappear without a trace. If you want to thoroughly eliminate them, you cannot expect it to be done overnight. All troops assigned to Pingxiang and Liuyang should not be transferred during the bandit suppression process to avoid shortcomings in space and time that affect the original plan. The bandit suppression troops and militia and volunteer teams in the counties near Pingxiang and Liuyang should also be allowed to be commanded and dispatched by Liu Jianxu to facilitate encirclement and benefit military opportunities, so that the bandits will not escape and the neighboring counties will be spared from the spread of the disease. This is the third thing that should be requested. 4. The Communist Party uses class struggle to separate the masses and coerce assimilation. It is pitiful that the people must strengthen their self-defense forces and have the ability to resist the coercion of the Communist bandits. However, self-defense workers only rely on spears and their abilities are weak, and they cannot be expected to be angry at the enemy and strengthen their courage to move forward. After the devastation of Pingxiang and Liuyang, if you want the people to buy guns, their financial resources are really insufficient. It is proposed that the relevant departments purchase more guns and distribute them to the volunteer teams in the two counties to strengthen their self-defense forces, so that even if the troops are transferred, the people can still resist the bandits, and there is no need to worry about the Communist Party imposing coercion. This is the fourth thing that should be requested. 5. There are more than ten thousand refugees from Pingxiang and Liuyang in the province, who are hungry and cold and cannot return. It is now proposed to select strong men and organize them into volunteer teams, appropriately allocate guns, and order them to follow the army back to the county to suppress bandits. The necessary expenses will be submitted for review and issuance after the compilation is completed. From now on, the relief work in Pingxiang and Liuyang will require huge amounts of money to be handled. It is requested that you, my lord, plan in advance to facilitate the progress, and also exempt Pingxiang and Liuyang from all taxes and miscellaneous levies. All collection agencies will not be restored temporarily to show sympathy. This</p>

<h3>Receiving Important Domestic News</h3>
<p>is the fifth thing that should be requested. 6. The social policy of the National Revolution is to help farmers and workers and eliminate the local tyrants. At this time of social chaos, it is especially important to promote this righteousness to determine the direction of the people. If the boundaries are not clear and the local tyrants are allowed to use the name of suppressing communism to act recklessly and help their evil deeds, then the villains will be happy and the good and weak will be chilled. How can we transform the world and create a new order? Therefore, all true local tyrants whose dirty deeds are obvious and hated by the public should be excluded from the suppression of communism and punished to avoid allowing the local tyrants to carry out their aggression and provide the Communist bandits with capital for agitation. This is the sixth thing that should be requested. The above statement is only the general outline. As for the detailed plan, it should be prepared after the promulgation of the outline of the pacification measures and submitted separately in a special case. All the reasons for the shallow views on the pacification of Pingxiang and Liuyang are respectfully submitted to the relevant departments for supervision and instruction. (October 25)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua Passes Through Jinan to Tianjin</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The former Commander-in-Chief of the 11th Route Army, Liu Zhenhua, returned from overseas to Jinan. This morning (26th) at 7:10, a special train from Jinan arrived. Han Fuju, the chairman of the provincial government, and Li Shuchun, the director of the civil affairs department, welcomed him at the station. Liu shook hands with the welcomers after getting off the train. I asked him about the task of going north. Liu said that he was going to Tianjin this time because he had just returned from overseas and was going to Tianjin to visit relatives and had no special task. Then he took a car with Han Fuju to the provincial government. Han invited Liu to Qianfoshan because today was Sunday and set up a banquet for Liu in the temple there to wash away the dust. Liu decided to go north that day, so his entourage still stayed at the station and his special train was sent back to Nanjing. At 1:30 PM, Han prepared a special train for Liu, and Liu started on his way north. Han personally went to the station to see him off. According to a certain important person, Liu Zhenhua and Yan Xishan are relatives. This trip to Tianjin will turn to Taiyuan to persuade Yan to step down. The task is quite important. According to another aspect, although Yan Liu has relatives, Liu Maoen's vote to the Central Government gave Yan a major blow militarily. Liu Maoen was Liu's former subordinate. I am afraid that Yan may not be dedicated to Liu until now, and Liu may not go there, but Liu's trip seems to be turning to Zhengzhou to negotiate the aftermath of the Northwest Army. It is said that after Liu arrives in Tianjin, he will first celebrate his mother's birthday and then work for national affairs. (October 26)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Finance Review the Shipping Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has submitted it to the National Government for approval.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association believes that in recent years, China's shipping industry has been affected by competition from foreign ships and military affairs, and its business has been declining. Members such as Yu Qiaqing have initiated the establishment of a shipping bank with a capital of 2 million yuan to provide merchants with flexible funds to develop their business. However, due to insufficient funds, it is specially requested that the National Government approve the issuance of special public bonds of 10 million yuan, which will be undertaken by the bank to raise funds to supplement its working funds, and to increase the ship tax by collecting money per ton as the fund for the principal and interest of this item. The National Government handed it over to the Executive Yuan to transfer it to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance for joint review. The results of the review showed that the establishment of a shipping bank can be handled to adjust shipping finance and relieve merchants in distress. However, increasing ship taxes and issuing public bonds are of great importance. After several consultations, it was finally concluded that there were many obstacles in increasing ship taxes in fact and it was impossible to implement. The fund for this public bond is planned to be allocated under the item of increasing customs duties. The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance have presented the results of the review to the Executive Yuan. It is said that the Executive Yuan has submitted it to the National Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Second Group of the Jiangsu Provincial Winter Defense Conference</h3>
<p>The second group of the Winter Defense Conference convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs was held this morning (28th) at 9:00 AM in the ordinary conference room of the provincial government. The attendees included Hu, the director of the department of civil affairs, the secretary Tong Danian, Lin Yichang, Hu Huisheng, Hu Weihe, the section chiefs Lu Changgan, Zhao Enju, Zhang Zhongli, Tian Bingzhang, Lin Wenqin, Guan Ji'an, the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of 14 counties including Zhenjiang, as well as Huang Chengqian (Miao Fan acting), the section chief of the provincial security office, Jiang Chaoxiong (Tao Fengwei acting), the chief of the 5th district of the water police. After the ceremony, the chairman Hu Puan, the director of the department, delivered an opening speech, saying that the meaning of holding this second group meeting today is to urge all counties to be extra diligent and cautious in the aspect of winter defense. Originally, spring, summer and autumn are all in the time of defense. Government personnel can be said to be responsible for the security of the people all year round, but it is especially necessary to prevent strictly in winter. The first step in strict prevention is that each county must first rectify its strength. Second, once there is strength, the counties must unite with each other to take responsibility for defense and suppression. In this conference, everyone should thoroughly discuss and come up with appropriate methods. Now that the military affairs of suppressing the rebels in the front have come to an end, the construction business is waiting to be continued, and the provincial government and county governments bear heavy responsibilities for security, because if the security is not done well, everything will be affected. We hold this winter defense meeting really to meet the needs of the people the most. The people of this province have suffered from banditry because in the past, each county only did the work of driving away bandits. If there are bandits in County A, they will be driven to County B, and if there are bandits in County B, they will be driven to County C. In this way, the banditry will never be eliminated and the people and suffering will not be exempted for a day. In this meeting, everyone should earnestly discuss the fundamental methods, and after going back, they should do the work of eliminating banditry. If each county can rectify its strength and implement joint defense, then the bandits can be eliminated in a short period of time. There is also one point. The motions and discussion results put forward by all the attending members must take into account the facts and must not only express empty words in theory. It is not responsible to the people and expectations only when it is difficult to implement in practice. After Director Hu's speech, because he attended the provincial government meeting, the section chief Lu Changgan chaired the meeting. Zhang Zhongchan reported the number of attendees, totaling thirty-two. The total number of proposals was sixty-eight. The chairman then reported the members of the review committee of each group: First group: police affairs: Zhang Zhongli, Chen Zhao, Xu Zusheng, An Zheng, Zhang Zhensong, convened by Zhang Zhongli; Second group: defense and suppression: Tian Bingzhang, Leng Jun, Zhang Peng, Zhao Shirong, Zhang Zuochen, convened by Tian Bingzhang; Third group: military salaries and equipment: Guan Ji'an, Shen Yong, Xie Yixiang, Sun Xiwu, Zhu Tingluan, convened by Guan Ji'an. The members of each review committee were convened by the designated personnel to hold a meeting. It is scheduled to complete the review tonight and hold the second meeting tomorrow (29th) at 8:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Encourages Local Disciples</h3>
<p>At the welcome meeting in Xikou</p>
<p>Ningbo Dispatch: After Chairman Chiang arrived in Fenghua, all circles in Xikou warmly welcomed him. When the welcome meeting was held on the afternoon of the 27th, Chairman Chiang and his wife, Ms. Soong Mei-ling, attended the meeting and encouraged the disciples of his hometown in the Fenghua dialect. The speech was very long and can be divided into five points: (1) To encourage young students in Fenghua to have the spirit of hard work and endurance to be the backbone of the future revolution; (2) I hope that the local elders will work hard in education and supervise their disciples to be strict. The reason why I can serve the party and the country today can be said to be due to my mother's education; (3) I am very satisfied with the daily progress of the Wuling Elementary School; (4) Fenghua has frequent fires for years. I hope that the local elders will promote afforestation to conserve water sources and avoid floods; (5) I hope to maintain the original virtues of the local area, such as loyalty, filial piety, diligence, frugality, hard work and endurance, and especially to have integrity. The evening was followed by a variety show and a lantern parade, with thousands of participants, which was very lively (National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Business Circles Consider the Issue of Year-End Account Settlement</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou City Money Industry Association resolved to follow the Gregorian calendar for the year-end account settlement and notified various industries. The Ningbo City Money Industry Association also reported to Hangzhou on the year-end account settlement at the end of the Gregorian calendar by the city's Commercial Federation. However, the silk industry, foreign goods industry, rice industry, cloth industry, north-south goods industry, etc. all believe that December 31 of the Gregorian calendar, which is November 13 of the lunar calendar, is when various industries are developing their business, and it is difficult to suddenly announce the settlement of accounts. Moreover, business and money transactions are not only in Hangzhou and Ningbo. If the methods are not uniform, it will definitely hinder the turnover of finance. Various industry associations have held meetings and discussed one after another, but there is no specific method to remedy it. Industries with a larger business scope advocate using the Shanghai market as the standard. As for the Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce, several executive members had discussions on this issue last month and inquired about the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, but did not get the point. Recently, the Chamber of Commerce believes that this is an important issue. Before this issue is resolved, it will hinder the progress of various industries. All executive members have been soliciting opinions and preparing proposals and plan to convene temporary meetings of members of various industry associations and store members to decide by majority. It is said that many merchant groups in various counties have inquired about this issue by letter. Once the method is determined, a notice will be issued.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>An adulterer plotted to kill his lover's husband but failed. Deng Jinsheng, a tailor who owned a tailoring shop at No. 72 Miaotang Lane, in front of the law office of lawyer Xie Hanshen, was 39 years old and from Weiting. His wife, Ms. Miao, is 30 years old and from Shanghai. She came to Deng's house as a child bride at the age of 13. After Zhou Deng got married at the age of 18, the relationship between the couple was ordinary. They have lived in Miaotang Lane for eight years. On the 14th day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar last year, she once ran away and Deng entrusted Wang Jinkui (36 years old, from Huaian), who was in the exploration team, to find her in Shanghai. After that, she ordered her husband to worship Wang as an old man. Since this spring, Wang has been staying at Deng's place because of something, and an affair occurred between him and Ms. Miao. Since last month, Wang has been living at Deng's house and has not left. Deng is inherently weak and timid. Although he knows the inside story, he has not dared to say anything. Unexpectedly, recently, there have been occasional phone calls to Xie's law office looking for Ms. Miao. Deng pretended to be his wife's voice to listen to what was going on. The phone call asked if the package was ready. Deng answered that it was not ready and the call was interrupted. At 11:00 AM on the 26th of this month, Ms. Miao suddenly said to her husband that she planned to go out to work as a servant. Her husband did not allow it, which led to an argument. Wang came and saw the situation and immediately called Deng to go upstairs. Deng ordered Wang to move away. Wang angrily pushed Deng down on the floor upstairs, stepped on Deng's abdomen with his feet, and tightly fastened a thin rope around Deng's neck. Deng immediately lost consciousness and only his feet were drumming on the floor, shaking the neighboring room. It happened that Gu Yulin, a neighbor of Deng's profession, brought his child to Deng's house to play because his wife went out to buy vegetables. Seeing Ms. Miao standing blankly downstairs, he asked if Lao Guan was at home. Ms. Miao initially did not answer and said that he was upstairs. When Gu went upstairs and saw the situation, he was shocked and shouted for help. Neighbors gathered and Wang escaped. Deng woke up. Yesterday (28th), Fang Ziqing, a patrol officer from the second and fifth sub-bureaus in charge of the area, sent the police to arrest the murderer Wang Jinkui at the Fengming Garden teahouse on Fuzhong Street and brought him, together with Deng and Ms. Miao, to the bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandits frequently robbed villages in Jiang County. On the evening of the 25th of this month at about 10:00 PM, three or four bandit boats suddenly came to the house of Guo Xiaoyou, a villager in Xidu Village, Nanma Township, Wujiang County. About 20 bandits struggled to enter and robbed the house. It is estimated that they robbed about three to five hundred yuan worth of foreign currency, clothes, and jewelry. After the bandits were full, they went to the side of Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>The chiefs of the five districts were ordered to be dismissed. The former orders of the Department of Civil Affairs to Wu County: Dou Weigan, chief of the 5th district; Wang Songbao, chief of the 8th district; Wang Kecheng, chief of the 11th district; Wu Jiazhen, chief of the 16th district; and Feng Qiunong, chief of the 18th district, were ordered to go to the province for training. The chiefs of the districts made excuses of illness and did not obey the order. Yesterday (28th), the Department of Civil Affairs ordered Huang, the county magistrate of Wu County, to dismiss the chiefs of the districts for disobeying the order and abandoning themselves and to cancel their qualifications as district chiefs to show punishment. After receiving the order, Huang, the county magistrate, immediately transferred it to the subordinate authorities for notification.</p>
<p>A well-known female rogue was arrested. Jin Kongshi (also known as Jin Aqiu), a famous female rogue in Hengjingdu Village, under the jurisdiction of the county, is 42 years old. She usually recruits thugs and opens opium dens in the countryside. Two years ago, she had an affair with bandit Yang Laowozi. Jin Kongshi secretly communicated with the bandits and instructed her accomplices to rob them. A secret report was made to Xiong, the commander of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, a few days ago. After receiving the report, Commander Xiong secretly ordered Huang, the county magistrate of Wu County, to order his subordinates to secretly arrest Jin Kongshi. After receiving the order, Huang, the county magistrate, sent a police team to the countryside to arrest Jin Kongshi and bring her to the county for interrogation. She confessed that she knew bandit Yang Laowozi and had an affair with him.</p>
<p>[P Wuxi&gt;</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau captured five suspects. Yesterday night at about 9:00 PM, Xu Jigui, the director of the county Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a secret report that Xiang Tingbang and other suspicious people from Hubei Province were staying in Room 19 of the Liangxi Hotel on the road. After receiving the report, Director Xu immediately secretly sent detectives to arrest Xiang Tingbang and other five people on the spot and brought them to the bureau for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>Building the hidden reef of the Xiyi Road. Yao Dixing, the director of the County Construction Bureau of the county, was ordered by the department to recruit workers to build the provincial road and ordered to build the Yiyi Road. After receiving the order, Director Yao actively prepared, but found that the construction of Yiyi was difficult because it was near Taihu Lake and the peaks and rocks of the Fulong Mountain Stone Lin were several times more difficult than ordinary filling. In addition, the mountain villages were remote and there were very few residents. Within ten miles, there were no workers to be recruited. Even if they were recruited more than ten miles away, it would be difficult for ordinary workers to be competent in opening mountains and chiseling rocks. In addition to preparing and drawing the plans and budgets for the bridges and culverts of the Yiyi Line, Director Yao also sent personnel to carry out construction surveying and presented four points of difficulty: (1) It is impossible to recruit workers along the way; (2) The recruited workers can only be ordered to fill the soil and cannot be forced to open the rock; (3) If the rock is changed to hired workers, the cost will be more expensive; (4) At present, the funds are only used for bridges and culverts, and where will the other expenses be raised? Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Construction Department for review and instructions.</p>
<p>Lu Shiqiao, who was sentenced to death, was sent to Suzhou. Lu Shiqiao, the former propaganda officer of the County Party Department, was sentenced to death for the tragic death of Tan Qibin, the former director of the Bei'an Township Administrative Bureau. Lu refused to accept the sentence and appealed. The Suzhou Higher Court ordered the Wuxi County government to send the case file and Lu himself to the Higher Court for review. After receiving the order, the County government sent police to send Lu Shiqiao and the main criminals in the same case, Bao Dayuan, to Suzhou for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Xiyi ferry was robbed in Yuncun. The Yonggu ferry, which belongs to the Gongyun Beixia Company, was robbed at 2:00 PM on the 27th when it passed through Yuncun after departing from Xi to Yi at 6:00 PM. Five passengers wearing long gowns bought tickets and got off the boat. Three people sat on the ferry and the other two boarded the old Lishun towboat behind. The boatman did not think so. When they were approaching Zhutang to Zhujiaqiao, there were more than ten bandits waiting on the bridge. When the ferry passed under the bridge, they pointed their guns and ordered the boat to stop. The five people who got off the boat in Yuncun also took out guns and forced the driver to stop the boat. The bandits rushed onto the boat and robbed it for an hour before leaving. The company and passengers suffered heavy losses. The company immediately telegraphed the company and reported to the Yixing County government to send personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Salt police privately arrested and were accused. Zhang Jie, the captain of the Wangdian smuggling suppression boat in Jiaxing, and others led the salt police to search the house of Wang Jiaobin, a Shaoxing passenger in Fengqiao Township a few days ago, and seized more than 20 kilograms of salt. Wang happened to be out, so he arrested Zhang Runlin, the village chief of the village, and caused injuries. Therefore, local people suddenly became annoyed. Zhang, the village chief, asked the court to examine his injuries because he was injured for no reason. At the same time, Wang Wenbin also told the court that his workers Gao Qichao and Chen Amao were also arrested by Captain Zhang and sent to the Pinghu Smuggling Suppression Brigade. The court has scheduled a hearing. After receiving the summons, Captain Zhang resisted and yesterday again beat Wang's workers Zhu Zhang with gun butts, causing serious injuries. Then, Wang Wenbin's younger brother and his sister-in-law and a twelve-year-old boy were also tied up. The local public group telegraphed the County Executive Committee to telegraph for rescue and telegraphed the Zhejiang Salt Transport Envoy to investigate thoroughly. It was learned that the arrested women and children had been released on bail. Wang Jiaobin complained to the court that the salt police harassed and disturbed the good people, and asked the court to examine the injuries of the injured workers and send personnel to the Pinghu Smuggling Suppression Brigade to bring back the victims and release them, and telegraphed the Salt Transport Envoy to suspend the offending salt police and send them to the court for punishment.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The county magistrate investigated the reason for the shutdown of Jun Da Dian: Qingyang Jun Da Dian was closed because the gold ornaments were detained by government official Shen Jinqing, and the households had no goods to redeem. Manager Jiang Xiangxian was forced to leave, and all employees announced the suspension of business. Now, Xue Shizu, the deputy head of Qingyang Town, and others, because Jun Da Dian was subjected to all kinds of harsh profits and oppression of the poor people by Shen Jinqing, specially submitted a petition to the county government to quickly summon Shen Jinqing for punishment, etc. County magistrate Li instructed the chief of the 11th district, Li Dichen, to investigate whether Shen Jinqing added extra profits and refused to release redemptions, and to reply for verification and handling.</p>

Now, the director of the 8th Public Security Bureau has learned about it and immediately led the police to arrest him. Three gamblers and a set of gambling equipment were captured on the spot. Just as they were about to be taken to the bureau, Li Zhan Ya and his wife were extremely rude and rushed forward to twist and beat the director of the bureau, and used a teacup to break the head of a police officer, causing blood to flow all over his face. The gamblers took the opportunity to escape. Director Cao then escorted the troublemaking Li Zhan Ya and his wife to the General Bureau and transferred them to the county government for handling.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>A record of the detective team's dangerous rescue of a ticket: The detective team of the Provincial Public Security Bureau has solved many bandit cases with remarkable achievements. A few days ago, it was reported that many bandits were hiding in Anyu Tao, and Shanghai's "meat tickets" and firearms were hidden. The team then sent detectives to secretly investigate and arrested two bandit informants. After interrogation, they confessed to the previous situation and pointed out the hiding place of the meat ticket. According to the confession, the team dispatched more than 30 police officers at four o'clock last night (the 27th) and rushed to Wubai Ferry Dam all night. According to the bandit informants, they found the hiding place of the meat ticket. Just as they were about to move forward, plainclothes bandits came towards them. The team members saw that the people were suspicious and went forward to question them. Unexpectedly, the people drew their guns and fired a signal into the sky. Gunshots rang out in Luzhou. Bandits who came from behind were ambushed and tried to rescue the meat ticket first. As they moved west, gunshots were heard again in the west. As they retreated north, they were blocked by bandits. At that time, the gunshots became more and more dense. More than 200 bandits surrounded them and approached them in an encirclement. The captain of the detective team knew that they had fallen into a trap and used a single-line formation to disperse them. Each team of more than ten bandits chased a soldier. Fortunately, the team leader bravely resisted and retreated south while fighting, crossed the railway to the local silkworm improvement association at Siji Ferry, and broke through the encirclement. They defended the area and fought against the bandits. They also sent a team to report to the Public Security Bureau to request reinforcements. After receiving the report, Director Chen immediately dispatched the entire team of the cavalry patrol team, the bicycle team, and the first squadron of the security team, as well as a platoon from the second squadron, led by Inspector Xu Dongfu, to Sibaidu via the Lianyu Tao railway and the Juzhen Road to join the detective team to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandits saw a large army gathered and knew they could not win, so they fled in different directions. Some fled to the north of the Yangtze River by boat, and some fled into the mountains. At six o'clock that night, the teams returned to the city one after another and captured four suspects, including one female offender. The captain of the detective team was shot and killed by bandits in the encirclement. Detective Ma Shirang and detectives Guo Zhengbang and Zhongying were killed. The body of Detective Ma was carried back by the reinforcements and sent to Shengshou Temple in Jikang Lane on Houjie. The family members rushed to the funeral after hearing the news and are now preparing for the coffin. The bodies of the detectives have been collected by their respective families. Director Chen reported the circumstances to the Civil Affairs Department and requested compensation because the three police officers, Ma, Guo, and Zhong, died on duty. He also requested that a large army be dispatched quickly to suppress the bandits and eliminate future troubles. According to a surviving detective, the bandit den is located near the Longkou area of Wubai Ferry, west of the station. The bandits knew that the government troops were going to suppress them, so they set up an ambush. The team sent only 30 police officers to deal with what they thought was an ordinary bandit den, which led to the danger. If they had not been well-trained, the entire army would have been wiped out. Some of the bandits wore suits and Zhongshan suits, and some wore long clothes and short clothes. They carried a variety of weapons, including long guns, Mauser pistols, and knives, and were extremely fierce.</p>

<p>The aftermath of various armies pursuing and suppressing bandits: The bandit gangs entrenched in Sanke Tree Market in Huaiyin fled from the market at 3 am on the 23rd. The temporary commander-in-chief, Jiang Chaoxiong, in addition to a few police teams from Huaiyin intercepting 14 meat tickets and 83 heads of cattle being sent to the city to be claimed, still led all the troops of the Water Police Training Camp to track and pursue them all the way to Laianji, Xiaowuji, Tangji and other places in Siyang, and again pursued and violently suppressed the bandit gangs. At nine o'clock in the evening, the bandits began to retreat to the north. In this battle, a total of more than 40 bandits were killed, beheaded and displayed to the public, more than 20 bandits were wounded, and more than 100 meat tickets were dropped. Zhao Zhenhua, the director of the Huaiyin Public Security Bureau, also dropped more than 10 meat tickets near Tang'an and captured a small steel cannon from the bandits, which was transported to Wulizhuang on the 24th.</p>
<p>Organizing a bandit disaster relief committee: This time, the 3rd and 4th districts of Huaiyin, such as Yugou, Langshi, Sanke Tree, Wangwei, Zhangwei, Zhao Ji Lingqiao (above 4 districts), Yuanji (3 districts) and other places suffered severely from bandit disasters. More than a thousand people were kidnapped and countless houses were burned. The entire town of Yuanji in the second district was turned into ruins. No one surnamed Wang was spared in Wangjia Caomiao in the fourth district. This is truly the most tragic event that has ever happened in this county. At 2 pm on the 24th, the 7th Party and Government Dialogue Conference of this county decided to organize the Huaiyin Bandit Disaster Relief Committee as soon as possible. First, the Party Department and the County Government will hire a number of committee members, and then proceed to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Encountering robbers on the way to pick up the bride: Liu Decai's daughter from Heiwangzhuang Post in Shao Bo was hired by Tan Shaoqing from Xiaqiao Township. The happy day was yesterday. The Liu family waited for the sedan chair but it did not arrive. At dusk, the matchmaker led the sedan chair bearers in a flustered manner.

Yesterday (27th), a special order was issued to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to investigate and reply. A large group of local bandits was discovered in Yanghu: The area around Yanfu, north of the Yangtze River, has always been plagued by bandits. Chief Li of the Provincial Security Department previously led a team to suppress them. Now it is reported that after the strict suppression by the security team, a part of these bandits, about 400 to 500 people, have fled into the Luyang Lake area. Today (27th), the 8th Public Security Bureau and the District Office of Shao Bo came to the city to report to the County Government and the Director of the Public Security Bureau.

<p>Strictly prohibiting the import of foreign rice into Zhejiang Province: Zhejiang Province has had a bumper harvest this autumn, and there is already a surplus of rice. However, the rice sold in the market is mostly from foreign countries. The Provincial Government specifically decided at a meeting that from November 1, 1920, to the end of February 1921, the import of foreign rice into the province will be prohibited. After March, the situation will be reviewed to determine whether to continue the prohibition or to relax it.</p>
<p>Lu Xingbang's plan to invade the border of Zhejiang: The Zhejiang Provincial Government believes that Lu Xingbang's troops in Fujian have retreated to the north of Youxi after resisting the Jinglu Army, and are successively retreating towards Songxi. Recently, there has been a rumor that they plan to flee from Songxi to Qiyuan in Zhejiang Province. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Security Team stationed on the provincial border to carefully defend and prevent them from fleeing into the province. The bandits and communists in the Tai Shun Qiyuan area have just been suppressed. If Lu's troops enter the province again, the people will suffer even more.</p>

<p>The eight colleges retained the president, and teachers and students attended classes as usual</p>
<h3>The Truth About Zhang Naiyan's Resignation Statement</h3>
<p>Reply to faculty and students of Zhongda</p>
<p>Zhang Naiyan's reply to the faculty and students of Zhongda stated the truth about his resignation. He said, "To all colleagues and students of Central University: I am very grateful for your repeated telegrams urging me to return to the school. This time, I, Naiyan, resigned because I am deeply afraid that my colleagues and students do not understand the truth, so I will briefly explain it. Since Minister Jiang Menglin took office, his measures for our school have been inexplicable. About ten years ago, Minister Jiang gave a lecture at the Education College, explaining the principles of the storm in detail. He said that there are three corners to the school's storm: one is the president, two are the faculty, and three are the students. If the president and the faculty are united, the students will fail. If the president and the students are united, the result is self-evident. The argument was novel and moved the listeners. Last summer, my colleagues and students of our school strived for funding, and the Executive Yuan decided to increase it. Minister Jiang first informed the students of our school by letter, and our school first heard about it. This summer, ten students from the Education College organized a Northeast Education Tour Group. Because our school usually subsidizes each person 20 yuan, Minister Jiang specially subsidized thousands of yuan. Therefore, our school was eclipsed in comparison. This is just a rough summary of the bigger issues. There is no need to mention all the other details. Recently, our school has unfortunately experienced storms many times. Who is behind them? Many people can tell. Recently, Minister Jiang even said to Chairman Jiang, 'Zhongda is a wrestling ground for nationalism and communism, and Labor University is a refuge for communism, equal to Xiaozhuang.' I, Naiyan, do not know about the situation of Labor University. Since Zhongda is a wrestling ground for two factions, then Naiyan is the first to bear the brunt. I am sincerely afraid of misleading the Party and the country and misleading our school. Chairman Jiang has also heard that there are many people outside who are willing to be the president, so I immediately resigned to make way for the talented. But yesterday's newspaper said that Minister Jiang said that the students of Zhongda did not have any outrageous actions, which proves that there is no one in our school who is wrestling. The front and back are also different. This is very strange. I specially reply and wish you all the best. Zhang Naiyan, October 28, 1920."</p>
<h3>Zhongda Will Not Set Up a General Affairs Office</h3>
<p>The students' and professors' opinions on the organization of the General Affairs Office are not in agreement, and it is unheard of in the University Organization Law. Zhongda will not set up this General Affairs Office. Under the president are the deans of each college. The various groups established in the administrative aspect are directly commanded by the president, and then discussed with the deans to handle the affairs of each group.</p>
<h3>The Students' Goal Has Been Achieved</h3>
<p>Classes as Usual</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th: After the head of the General Affairs Office, Huang Pu Huan, left the school, classes continued as usual and there were no other disturbances. The school's future administrative organization will not set up a General Affairs Office. Under the president are the deans of each college, and the affairs of each group are handled in consultation with the deans. Most of the students no longer have other actions because they have achieved their goal of improving school affairs.</p>
<h3>President Zhang Invites Each College to Take Charge</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th: Today, President Zhang Naiyan of Zhongda sent a telegram from Shanghai saying that during Naiyan's resignation, each college president should jointly take charge of school affairs, and each director should handle the affairs of each group in consultation.</p>
<h3>The Experimental School Retains the President</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th: The Zhongda Experimental School sent a telegram to Jiang on the 28th, saying that the report that President Zhang had resigned to Junzuo was shocking. Both the university and the experimental school rely on President Zhang to preside over them, and cannot allow him to leave. After discussion by all the faculty and staff, in addition to sending another telegram to President Zhang to retain him, I sincerely ask Junzuo not to approve his request and order him to return to the school as soon as possible to comfort the public. Another telegram was sent to Zhang, saying that the university and the experimental school rely on your presidency, and it is shocking to hear that you suddenly want to leave. Now that the reform of school affairs is in progress, please focus on the school, dispel your intention to resign, and return to the school to preside over it.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of Expelling Huang Pu Huan From School</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th) morning, Zhongda held a memorial week. More than a thousand students attended the meeting. Huang Pu Huan, the head of the General Affairs Office, presided over the meeting and reported that the school authorities had cut and reorganized the three departments of the Secretary's Office, the Teaching Affairs Office, and the General Affairs Office in order to save expenses. After Huang finished his report, the students raised three questions: 1. Was President Zhang's resignation forced by Huang? 2. The report on improving school affairs carried in the newspapers the day before yesterday, which Huang represented Zhongda in hosting news reporters, was completely inconsistent with the facts. 3. The establishment of the General Affairs Office was inconsistent with the University Organization Law. Was it Huang's proposal? Huang replied that it was proposed by the president. The students then asked Huang whether he agreed with this proposal. Huang gave an ambiguous answer. Therefore, all the students applauded like thunder and unanimously advocated that Huang, since he did not agree with the establishment of the General Affairs Office, should immediately resign from the post of head of the General Affairs Office and leave the school to show his determination. At that time, they swarmed Huang out of the school.</p>
<h3>Professors' Suggestions for Improving School Affairs</h3>
<p>Professors Cai Bao, Ai Wei, Hu Shanheng, Duan Tiaoyuan, Zhao Yunfang, and 24 others at Zhongda advocated improving school affairs. The day before yesterday, they submitted the following six suggestions to President Zhang: 1. Increase the powers of the deans and department heads. 2. Reorganize the school affairs meeting in accordance with the University Organization Law and increase the number of professor representatives. 3. Important school affairs must be executed after being approved by the school affairs meeting. 4. The three departments of the Teaching Affairs Office and the Secretary's Office are inconsistent with the University Organization Law and should be abolished together, and there is no need to set up other organizations similar to the three departments. 5. The distribution of school funds should follow the standards decided by the Ministry of Education and the National Education Conference. 6. It is hoped that the funds of each college will be independent. After the above six suggestions were delivered to the president, Professor Cai Bao talked about yesterday that President Zhang fully agreed with the opinions of the professors and colleagues, and volunteered to join the ranks of the proposers in order to proceed in a unified manner. The report that the professors and President Zhang disagreed on the proposal to improve school affairs and were forced to resign was completely inconsistent with the facts. The professors and colleagues had no gap with the president. The proposal advocated by the colleagues should be abolished together because the establishment of the office was not stipulated by the University Organization Law. If it is considered necessary to establish it, the school affairs meeting should be reorganized first, and then handed over to the meeting for detailed discussion and decision before execution. In this way, school affairs will not be controlled by a few people and disputes will naturally subside. President Zhang has expressed his full sympathy for this proposal.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Student Union</h3>
<p>Abolish the Secretary's Office and Request to Return to School Soon</p>
<p>The Student Union of National Central University held an emergency meeting yesterday. More than ten people, including Huang Yuanchang, Ren Xia, and Song, attended the meeting. Chairman Zhang Zhenyu decided to send the following telegram to the president: To President Junmou, No. 816, Qingli, Wuding Road, Shanghai: The Student Union still adheres to the previous proposal on the administrative organization of the school. Only the Secretary's Office should be abolished and two offices, the Teaching Affairs Office and the General Affairs Office, should be established to avoid the bias of power and increase efficiency. Please approve it and hope that you will return to the school immediately to adopt the will of the students and continue to improve school affairs. Respectfully, the Student Union of National Central University.</p>
<h3>Eight Colleges Telegraph Chairman Jiang</h3>
<p>Approve President Zhang's Immediate Return to School</p>
<p>The eight colleges of Zhongda sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang, requesting him to approve President Zhang's immediate return to school. The original telegram said, "An urgent telegram from Fenghua to Chairman Jiang: I was shocked to read the report that President Zhang Naiyan of our school suddenly submitted a request to resign. I do not know the reason for this in detail, and rumors are rife, causing doubts and suspicions. If there is any disturbance, it is not the intention of the country to protect education. Please approve his immediate return to school to preside over school affairs and dispel doubts. Respectfully, the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Science, the College of Law, the Education College, the Agricultural College, the Engineering College, the Business College, and the Medical College of National Central University."</p>
<h3>Students of the College of Agriculture Request the President to Return to School</h3>
<p>The College of Agriculture of Central University sent an airmail telegram saying, "To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office: I recently sent a telegram to President Zhang Junmou, which reads, 'To President Zhang, Hongqingli, Wuding Road, Shanghai: I was shocked to hear that you suddenly have the intention of resigning and have news of resignation. At this time when the reform of school affairs is in progress, I hope that you will focus on the school, dispel your intention to resign, and return to the school to preside over school affairs. I pray that you will publish it immediately.' The College of Agriculture of Zhongda is grateful."</p>
<h3>The Distribution of Administrative Expenses of Zhongda</h3>
<p>The new salaries of staff and general office expenses have not exceeded the regulations of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>It is rumored that the administrative expenses of Central University are as high as more than 300,000 yuan. Yesterday, I asked the county to publish the actual situation as follows: The total budget for the school's 19th year is 1,920,000 yuan, including 1,370,000 yuan for the expenses of the eight colleges, 167,000 yuan for the total construction cost, 44,000 yuan for the expenses of the experimental school, and 20,000 yuan for the overseas study expenses. The remaining 310,000 yuan is distributed as follows: A. Non-Administrative Expenses: 1. Military Education Department Expenses: 18,000 yuan; 2. General Physical Education Expenses: 16,000 yuan; 3. Sports Expenses: 3,600 yuan; 4. Equipment Expenses: 37,000 yuan (national books, instruments, etc. of each college are paid under the expense items of each college and are not included); 5. Subsidies: 3,000 yuan (subsidies to various institutions and groups such as Gulou Kindergarten, University Federation, etc. and subsidies for children of revolutionary heroes): A total of 77,600 yuan. B. Administrative Expenses: 1. Staff Salaries: 126,800 yuan; 2. Wages: 35,600 yuan; 3. Office Expenses: 73,000 yuan: A total of 235,400 yuan. It can be seen that the total of the first two items of Item B on the right, which is 162,000 yuan, and the office expenses of 73,000 yuan, meet the recent Second National Education Conference's plan to improve higher education: "Staff salaries shall not exceed 10% and office expenses shall not exceed 5% to 10%". This is the truth about the administrative expenses of Zhongda.</p>
<h3>The August Education Fee in Su Province Will Be Issued</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Fund used to spend more than 160,000 yuan per month. Since the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office was reorganized and the funds of Central University were incorporated, the monthly expenditure is about 300,000 yuan. It is reported that the May Jiangsu Provincial Education Fund (provincial schools and Central University, etc.) was issued a week ago. Currently, the Management Office is urging the counties to collect funds and borrowing about 300,000 yuan from the banking sector, which will be issued within a week in August.</p>
<p>Explanation from the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3>Cultural Organizations Include Academic Organizations</h3>
<p>According to the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau's request for interpretation, what is the difference between the academic organizations mentioned in the "Measures for the Management of Academic Organizations by Educational Administrative Organs" promulgated earlier and the cultural organizations mentioned in the "Outline of Cultural Organization Organizations" passed by the Central Sixth and Seventh Standing Committees? Please instruct them to comply with the directive of the Ministry of Education to the bureau, which reads, "I have learned that the cultural organizations mentioned in Article 2 of the 'Outline of Cultural Organization Organizations' passed by the Central Sixty-seventh Standing Committee on January 23 of this year include academic organizations. The 'Measures for the Management of Academic Organizations by Educational Administrative Organs' issued by this department on December 13, 18, regarding registration procedures and other matters, are not fully applicable. They are currently being revised and will be ordered to comply with them after they are announced. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>The Board of Directors of the Beiping Republic of China and North China Colleges are Registered</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education approved the establishment of the Board of Directors of the Private Beiping Republic of China University and issued an order to the Education Department of Hebei Province, saying, "According to the Private Beiping Republic of China University Board of Directors' submission of registration documents for the Board of Directors and the school, please grant registration. After review, there are no discrepancies. The establishment of the school board is approved, and the registration is also approved. However, the name should be changed to the Private Republic of China College Board of Directors. The registration of the school will be verified after staff are sent to inspect it." The order for the Board of Directors of North China University also instructed to change the name to the North China College Board of Directors. The order is the same as before.</p>

<p>Order from the Zhejiang Education Department</p>
<h3>Increases, Decreases, Borrowings, and Transfers of Education Fees Should Be Reported for Approval</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department recently stated that most counties and cities have not submitted special reports for approval in advance for various procedures such as new additions, new reductions, borrowings, and transfers of education funds, and only listed them in the work table budget book, which is close to deception. It is now specifically stipulated that in the future, special reports should be submitted for approval before they can be handled. The original order stated that matters such as new additions or reductions in education funds in various counties and cities, matters where there are no precedents to follow, and matters such as borrowing funds and transferring deposits are all important and should be reported for approval in advance before they can be handled. It is true that many counties and cities have followed this, but it has also been found that some only generally list them in the work situation report form or the county education fund budget book to obtain approval. It is not a special report and it feels close to deception. In addition to the fact that the above-mentioned matters must be reported specifically and must not be resisted, it is now also stipulated that the cases decided by the county education committee, etc., listed in the work table should be enclosed in parentheses under the decision cases and marked with the words "already", "not yet", "specially reported" or "other case" to facilitate audit when submitting the budget annually. For increases and decreases, the reasons should also be explained for each item to show whether a special report has been submitted or not. For this purpose, all county and city governments are hereby notified to comply with this order and not to violate it.</p>

Then, all athletes and staff circled the field to begin the competition. In various sports, such as the women's javelin throw, the men's long jump, high jump, and pole vault, the records of the 4th Central China Games were broken. The details are as follows: Women's javelin throw: 32.72 meters, achieved by female student Fang Yufen. The record of the 4th Central China Games was 31.68 meters. Men's high jump: 1.64 meters.

<h3>Detailed Record of the Public Memorial for Martyr Hui Youguang</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>It has been three years since the death of Martyr Hui Youguang of Shaanxi. Recently, due to his repatriation to his hometown, Yu Youren and others initiated a public memorial. I had several official contacts with Mr. Hui and deeply admired him, so I also went to participate. Here is a record of what I saw and heard that day.</p>
<p>The hall was in the Cishou Hall, to the right of the Jade Buddha Temple in Binlang Road. A couplet was hung at the entrance: "Where else can I meet you? I recall your spirit suppressing a thousand troops in the past. Everyone praised Yuan Long's uninhibited demeanor." "Your plans were never used. Looking back at the time when you were the mainstay, containing the raging waves, I deeply regret that you were only one Kui in this disastrous time." Next to it was a guest book. After the guests signed in, each was given a blue flower and a white ribbon, pinned on their chest. On top, written in white paper, was "The Spirit Tablet of Mr. Hui Youguang." It was placed in the center of the table, which was filled with fruits, dried snacks, and flower vases. Below were six wreaths. A blue silk banner with gold characters was hung above, reading, "Eternally Preserved in Historical Memory. We Envision Your Revolutionary Spirit." Yu Youren was wearing a plain blue silk jacket that day, with the collar buttoned but not fastened, and black shoes and white bamboo cloth socks with the trousers covering the back of his feet, completely in the style of a scholar. After arriving at half-past eleven, he nodded to the guests as a greeting, and looked at the elegiac texts on the four walls. The memorial service began at twelve o'clock, with Yu as the presiding officer. The ceremony was very simple. First, flowers were offered, then the eulogy was read, and then three bows were performed, completely different from the old ceremonies such as offering silk and wine in ordinary public memorials. After the ceremony, the guests surrounded the spirit tablet. Yu stood in the position of presiding officer and gave a speech. Before he opened his mouth, tears welled up in his eyes. He wiped his eyes with his left hand and said that Hui Youguang was a pitiful revolutionary, who spent his life running for the revolutionary cause, adhering to his principles, unafraid of difficulties and dangers, bold and determined, and respected by his comrades. What he did was unknown to outsiders, and he did not seek to be known. He lived his life as a true revolutionary practitioner. When he was critically ill, he was still concerned about the cause of the Party and the country. His family property was completely sacrificed for the revolution. Now he is repatriated to his hometown, which is slightly better than the situation of the starving people in Guanzhong. Alas, my pitiful revolutionary comrade is now finally laid to rest. How can I not feel sorry for him? As he spoke, he frequently wiped his tears with his sleeves, and many in the audience were also in tears. Then, Sun Longji recounted Mr. Hui's deeds, saying that Mr. Hui returned to China from Japan under the orders of the Premier to take charge of revolutionary work in northern Shaanxi, enduring all kinds of hardships. His father, brothers, and brothers all died at the same time. When Tian Weiqin and Hui opposed each other, they advised him to leave his hometown for a temporary refuge. He only had a wife left in his family, and the couple was very affectionate. His wife was seriously ill, and he couldn't bear to leave home. After the comrades prepared a horse, they forcibly dragged him away. Only then did he leave with tears in his eyes. Four hours after he left, more than a hundred soldiers surrounded his home, but fortunately he had already escaped. Otherwise, he would have been in danger. When the Jingguo Army disintegrated, Mr. Hui was captured and sentenced to be shot. He was calm and composed, and sang to express his determination. There is justice, justice, hold it and do not move it. You make me live, and I will die for you. After being rescued, he continued to fight without fear. He assisted the Jian'guo Army in relieving the siege of Guangzhou, and the Premier was able to survive. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Mr. Hui has no children and is succeeded by his nephew. His family is in dire straits. All my comrades, please find ways to help. More than a hundred guests came that day from various provinces. Among them, a young woman and a bald-headed monk were the most noticeable. There were many eulogies and elegiac couplets, which I couldn't remember. Here is an excerpt from the newest one: "In the vast sea of people, a bright and sparkling wave has sunk. On the rolling banks of the Yellow River, a great man who was a pioneer and visionary rests in eternal sleep. Ah, he is Mr. Hui Youguang. Ah, he struggled with an indomitable spirit until he sacrificed himself, setting off a surge of revolution in the Northwest and awakening the weak in their dreams. Although Mr. is now dead, the blood-like waves are still surging. Look, look! This is the path of light that Mr. showed us weak people. Forward! Forward!" The meeting was adjourned for a while, and a photo was taken together in front of the Great Buddha Hall, and then went to the Luye Hall for lunch. The dishes were prepared by the temple and were excellent in color and taste. I returned and wrote this to express my condolences.</p>
<h3>Research on the Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>— Lv Bing</p>
<p>Gandhi of India has already been arrested and imprisoned, but the British government is still holding a Round Table Conference and wants to invite him to join. Although the term Round Table Conference is commonly seen in newspapers, its origin seems to be something that the general public wants to know. I, despite my limited knowledge, have searched ancient books to conduct research on the Round Table Conference.</p>
<p>The originator of the Round Table Conference was King Arthur of England, who was injured and died in the Battle of Mount Badon in 520 AD. Therefore, the first Round Table Conference was held approximately 1,400 years ago. The king was handsome and intelligent from a young age. After being elected by the nobility to become the ruler, he was especially wise and courteous, and had a chivalrous style. He specially made a round table in the palace for meetings with the Palutuo. Everyone at the table was free to report and express their opinions. According to the king's intention, a table that is square or long has a distinction between high and low seating, but a round shape does not distinguish between sizes. Any Palutuo can be regarded as equal. Since then, important British meetings, or negotiations between nobles and commoners, have often used a round table to show respect. However, the name round table is essentially an ancient British representation of equality. If unequal treaties are still advocated in the discussions at the round table, then the original intention of establishing the round table will be lost.</p>
<h3>Dumplings and Buns</h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>Every time after 4:00 PM, I always think of the "Twitching Dumplings" of Sanpailou and the "Nanxiang Buns" of Dongyuanmen at the City Temple. Looking back, only twenty years or so have passed, but it already fills me with a sense of nostalgia.</p>
<p>The "Twitching Dumplings" of Sanpailou were the most famous. The method of preparation was to remove the tendons from the vegetables, chop them finely, mix them with cooked lard, and use them as fillings. The dumplings were then made from water-ground flour and thrown into a boiling water pot. The lid was covered for one minute and then the dumplings were scooped out. The flavor was fresher and more delicious than meat dumplings, so there were many buyers. It could be called a unique business. Later, because the proprietress died, the store also closed. The "Twitching Dumplings" became a long-lost delicacy.</p>
<p>The "Nanxiang Buns" of Dongyuanmen at the City Temple had thin skin, lots of meat filling, and a lot of soup. Foodies flocked to it. There were no empty seats in the morning and evening. Every time a batch was released, everyone scrambled to buy them. There was such a rush that they could hardly keep up. One had to wait one or two hours to enjoy them. If it was a Sunday, one had to pre-order the night before. They were extremely popular at one time. Now, however, there is only Dongyuanmen, and there is no more Nanxiang Bun shop.</p>
<h3>Remembering the Forts of Taiwan Back Then</h3>
<p>— Gu Tou</p>
<p>The northeast corner of the Wusong Forts and Taiwan Customs Lighthouse, before the base was filled in by the dredging bureau, was originally a vast expanse of the Huangpu River. The river water formed a large bend here, entering the Yangtze River and flowing into the sea. The old forts of thirty years ago were built on this bank, hence the name "Forts of Taiwan." It is said that the old forts were very solidly built, with a superior location and magnificent shape, making them the only defense in China and the first gateway to the Yangtze River. All ships entering and leaving, both Chinese and foreign, regarded it as an important pass. After the Boxer Protocol was signed, the great powers suggested forcing the destruction of the Dagu Forts in our country. The British bribed officials to deceive the Qing court, and on the other hand colluded with treacherous people, sparing no expense to buy up and dismantle the Wusong Forts. Up to now, the old site of the forts is completely gone, leveled to the ground, with no trace of its former grandeur. Only on the left side of the gate of the Coastal Patrol Office of the Navy Department, there is a pile of stones more than two zhang high, sticking out from the top of the wall. It is said to be the remains of the old Wusong Fort (now the Coastal Patrol Office has built weather instruments to observe the weather every day). The autumn wind blows through the crops, and human affairs are constantly changing. Looking back on those days, I can't help but sigh.</p>
<p>It is said that before the old Wusong Fort was demolished, the "Forts of Taiwan" station on the Songhu Railway was far to the north of the current Wusong Radio Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. After the old fort was destroyed and the new fort was built (that is, the current Lion Grove and South and North forts), it was quite inconvenient to set up the station there, so it was shrunk and moved south of the Customs Lighthouse, which is the current site of the station.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (65)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>There are no rickshaws in Mandalay. Horse-drawn carriages are also quite beautiful and the price is quite cheap, which is different from China. One or two corners for one hour at most, or half a yuan recently. In China, calling a carriage always costs one yuan as a minimum. However, economic conditions are not always the same. For example, printing 100 business cards costs 3 kyats, which is 4 yuan in China, about ten times the price in China. How strange. The various foods and snacks made by the Kala and Burmese people are all delicious. Because their preliminary knowledge only allows them to make these. As for machines, they do not understand.</p>
<p>In the evening, Mr. Zhuang Haiquan invited me to watch a Burmese movie. The acting method was also quite impressive, suspected to be directed by a Westerner. The first act was about a female knight errant searching for her friend's husband. In the end, she not only rescued her friend, but also found her own husband. Women in China do not have this kind of thinking, and their social activism cannot be compared to Burmese women. The next act was about the Burmese king protecting the Buddhist teachings. One could see the grandeur of the Burmese palace in ancient times, which was quite worth watching. However, the Burmese Buddhism is always superstitious in nature, which we are not very willing to watch.</p>
<p>There was a Li Ziqing from Hunan, who worked as a foreman in an English iron ore factory in the Mei Miao Shang Nong Zi Ke area. According to him, there were 1400 to 1500 Chinese workers here the year before last, which has been reduced to 400 to 500 last year. Most of them are from Yunnan, and there are also people from other provinces. Sometimes they fight because of competing for work. The wages can only be earned during the four months from the ninth lunar month of the year. The rest of the time is not favorable, and it is easy to get sick. Therefore, work is stopped. During these four months, each person's salary is usually about 100 kyats. It takes twenty days for Yunnan workers to travel back and forth, so this can be a small supplement. The English iron ore mine is very large in scale. He could not know its capital of millions, but he heard that this owner was already the third time running it. The previous two owners had failed, which shows that the last effort is important in everything. Also, this factory originally produced silver, and now it produces iron. This proves that Myanmar is rich in various mineral products. The profit from teak is also very huge every year. Someone who deals in ivory was asked. There are wild elephants in the mountains of the northern border, which the locals capture and sell.</p>
<p>Wang from Yunnan talked about marble. Marble comes from Dali Prefecture. It is not like the white stone Buddha statues here, nor is it jade, but a kind of lithic rock with dark trees and floral patterns. The stone is naturally produced and has various beautiful patterns, which can be used for screens and tabletops. However, it is brittle and difficult to protect, so it is not easy to bring out. Also, its texture is not flat but oblique, so its surface cannot be ground flat. The value is still cheap in Yunnan itself. If it leaves the country, it will be very expensive. The patterns of marble are not flowers, but fossils of plants and animals. Chinese people who do not know science only think it is beautiful, but do not know how to use a scientific study. If fossils are investigated, geology can be known. I hope that geologists, biologists, and mineralogists will come to the southwest for great research, which will surely lead to great discoveries. The government only cares about war, how can it care about this? However, if the chairmen of the provincial governments are slightly more knowledgeable, they should set aside a kind of regular expense for those who invent machines and engage in scientific and cultural undertakings, to fund their investigations and experiments. This is still better than only knowing how to collect money from the people to kill people.</p>
<h3>Heart's Warmth (303)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Tears Shed on All Sides, Red Romance Saddened; The Whole Place Enamored, Greenery Lingering</p>
<p>The troops marched into the room. They were originally prepared to open fire, but without the order from Commander-in-Chief Mrs. Yin, no one dared to act. After all, Mrs. Yin was an experienced general, adhering to Zhuge Wuhou's teaching of "be bold yet cautious," and acted with prudence. She thought, this place is, after all, my husband's small villa, isn't it? Because all the furnishings are newly acquired, there is nothing to recognize as evidence. But if there's no material evidence, there is personal testimony. First, summon the chief of staff. Who knew that the young master, the chief of staff, had gone downstairs to some real estate company to inspect their real estate section. Then summon the captain of the advance team, the coachman Gensheng. He knew that he had taken the young master yesterday, and today the truth had come out. When the master returns, he will blame me, saying that I am the source of the trouble. To be honest, the master and the concubine have always been kind to me, spending a lot of money on me. Now I have released them from their cage, which is a bit unreasonable. This time, my job is definitely not secure. So, as a pioneer, he dared not come upstairs, hiding only in the kitchen of the neighbor's house. But this matter was destined to be exposed. Mrs. Yin, with her keen eyes and quick hands, saw a photo on the dressing table. She quickly grabbed it and took a look. Wasn't it the master's portrait? Mrs. Yin shouted, "Good, good! The evidence of the crime is here. What else is there to say?" Someone said, "Mrs. Yin, that's not quite right. There is evidence, but no stolen goods." In fact, in Mrs. Yin's heart, the word "stolen goods" was not wrong at all. Things can be stolen, and why can't people be stolen? That's why when a woman has an affair, society calls it "stealing a man." Mrs. Yin thought, my good husband has been stolen by you. Now that the evidence of the theft has been obtained, there is no denying it. The commander-in-chief then issued a mobilization order, shouting, "Strike!" At that time, a group of female soldiers had already been sharpening their fists, waiting for orders. When they came, they were all empty-handed. Now they all had weapons in their hands, which were confiscated on the spot. Some had feather dusters, some had laundry pestles, some had bamboo poles from mosquito nets, and some went to the kitchen to get fire tongs. They all acted at once. There was a clanging sound as they smashed all kinds of perfume bottles, hair tonics, and floral water displayed on the dressing table onto the floor. The whole room was filled with fragrance. There was a popping sound as Hong Lianxiang's latest enlarged photograph was shattered, the glass turned into icy patterns. Then there was a crashing sound as all the porcelain basins and porcelain water jugs on the washstand were smashed to pieces. In short, the room was reduced to a scene of devastation. At that time, fortunately, Hong Lianxiang herself was clever and did not resist them at all, adopting a policy of non-resistance. If you were to resist, Mrs. Yin would slap you in the face. Now that Mrs. Yin did not act, the group of female soldiers did not dare to act either. Hong Lianxiang had no other option but to cry.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Price Soars Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fluctuations and Uncertainties with Five Taels of Twists and Turns: Yesterday, the gold market was unusually chaotic. It was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, with twists and turns of five taels. In the afternoon, it became even sharper, with differences exceeding six taels. The waves were turbulent, and in the end, it rose, and the short sellers had little hope. As for foreign exchange, it was also tense. Banks advanced and retreated. However, there were discrepancies in buying and selling on the market, and the psychology of the industry was firm and bullish. In the early market, Yu Da, Fuxing Yong, Fuchang, etc., first sold and then bought. Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong, Yuanxing Yong, etc., all made purchases. Yuansheng Yifeng Yong, etc., had already sold. The overseas silver market was very calm, so the gold market in the morning was not volatile. Later, as sellers crowded in, they once broke through the 580 tael mark. Then, sellers rushed to buy back, and the market suddenly turned weak to good, gradually rising sharply by more than five taels. In the late market, Chenfeng Yong, Cuitai, Zhifeng Yong, and some speculators bravely bought in, advancing quickly and deliberately fueling the rise, soaring four or five taels, suddenly breaking through 88 taels. Finally, Yuanmao Yong and arbitrageurs tended to sell, reversing the trend and plunging three taels, abruptly retreating to within 86 taels. Overall, observing the situation, it still needs to fluctuate once, but there may be optimism about the future. Today, silver bars may fall to 0.625, which still needs to be verified.</p>
<p>The Morning Initially Stabilized, then Suddenly Soared at Noon: The opening price for December gold yesterday was 582 taels 1 mace, slightly higher by 4 cash (gross market around 82 taels). The price of large bars did not change, only increasing by one-eighth. Thus, the gold price was able to hold steady without falling. Later, Fuchang, Yu Da, Fuxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, etc., all sold, dragging it down by more than three taels. However, foreign exchange was flat. Taiwan bought spot, and Dalian was at 1 tael 2 mace 7.5 fen. Datong, Macgregor, Anda, Shiye, and others did one-month British gold at 1.7375. When the telegraphic transfer rate was announced, it fell to 79 taels, and the listed price did not move. Later, Mitsui absorbed December British gold at 1.73125. Shanghai and Mitsui traded this month's price, the same. Thus, the gold price was at 79 taels and zero. Later, because Yu Da, Fuchang, Fuxing Yong, etc., re-entered the market, Zhengjin ate December Citibank at $39.125, so the price gradually rose, with a rise and fall of one tael, reaching 83 taels 5 at 10:30. Yuancheng came to sell retail, so it fell by two taels. Foreign exchange was flat, and trading was not smooth, reaching 81 taels 7 or 8 mace at 11:15. However, Zhifeng Yong and arbitrageurs had persistent intentions, so they jumped up again by more than two taels. At 11:30, it reached 84 taels 2 or 3 mace. This month's Japanese gold needs to be settled at 1 tael 2 mace 7.75 to 8.75. After entering, there was a slight rotation of several cash. At noon, it retreated to 2 taels 7 or 8 mace, and the closing price was 3 taels 2 mace. Re-opening the market by five or six cash, then goods came in. However, Yuanheng, etc., sold, suppressing it again to 3 taels 3 or 4 mace. The announced price was still calculated at 624 taels 6 mace, initially deducting 45 or 6 taels, then around 41 taels.</p>
<p>Repeatedly Fluctuating, Returning High by Four Taels One Mace: The market opened at 83 taels. Subsequently, there were some fluctuations of several cash, but trading was sparse. Suddenly, because Yuanheng, etc., sold off, it immediately fell to 2 taels 1 or 2 mace. Suddenly, Chenfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Tianyu Yong, etc., entered the market to compete for purchases, and exchange drafts also showed a lively color. November Japanese gold was traded at 1 tael 2 mace 7.625, and British gold was traded at 1.725. Then, HSBC issued Zhengjin to enter March at 1.73125, especially as the Dalian gang bought in November Japanese gold at 1 tael 2 mace 7.875. Thus, the gold price jumped by four or five taels. At 3:00, it was 87 taels 4 mace. Retail investors sold out, retreating to 5 taels 7 mace. Chenfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Richang, etc., continued to enter without slackening. Moreover, British gold was also tight. Huayi issued December at 1.725, so it was raised by three taels. At 3:50, it reached 88 taels 7 mace. People's hearts were quite firm, and the market atmosphere was flying and soaring. Unexpectedly, at 4:00, Yuanmao Yong, Yuxing Yong, Xieyu, and goods suddenly came to spit it out, plunging steeply by three taels. At 4:15, it was calculated at 85 taels 7 mace. In an instant, it added another one tael zero, calculated at 6 taels 8 or 9 mace. However, sellers were endless. Almost at 4:30, the closing price was calculated at 85 taels 8 mace. Compared with the day before, it rebounded by four taels one mace. Subsequent continuations had already been shaved off by seven or eight cash. The maximum price in one day was 88 taels 7 mace, and the minimum price was 79 taels, calculated at a high-low difference of nine taels seven mace. The announced price was deducted from 41 or 2 taels to 36 or 7 taels. The closing price was 38 or 9 taels. The registered relief was 92 taels in November, 83 taels in December, 96 taels for replenishing water, and 99 taels in the afternoon. The early opening price for goods was 1 tael 8 cash, the noon closing price was 3 taels 3 cash, the afternoon closing price was 2 taels 9 cash, and the market closing price was 5 taels 8 cash.</p>
<p>In Confused Inflow and Outflow, Intentions Contradict Each Other: The trading of various firms was chaotic. Yuanxing Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Yongfeng, Deheng, Shunli were all entering the market. Yu Da, Fuchang, Fuxing Yong, Yuanheng were exiting and re-entering. Yuancheng, Yongde, Yifeng Yong, Wanxing, etc., had a supply exceeding demand. Zhifeng Yong, Taikang Run, Yuancheng Yong, etc., had inconsistent inflow and outflow. In the afternoon, Chenfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Cuitai, Tianyu Yong, etc., were all entering the market, with some speculators buying in on behalf. Xieyu, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong had inconsistent inflows and outflows. Yu Da, Shunli, Yifeng Yong, etc., all had sales. The rest of the firms had inflows and outflows at times. The Dalian gang had about 3,000 exchange drafts transacted in total, so the inflows and outflows were balanced. The Guang gang was extremely quiet, so there were few inflows and outflows seen.</p>
<h3>Tense Foreign Exchange Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was quite calm, and exchange rates rose slightly. HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates did not change at all. However, the domestic market seemed to be tightening, as the gold price turned from weak to strong, with a difference of about ten taels throughout the day, eventually seeing a rise of four taels zero. As for the results of the British, American, and Japanese exchange markets, compared with the day before, British gold shrank by 0.125, American gold shrank by 0.25, and Japanese gold rose by 0.25. Chinese merchants traded quite actively, buying and selling an estimated total of more than 200,000 pounds of British gold. Banks made some purchases, such as Mitsui and Taiwan. In the afternoon, Yufeng Yong, etc., chased to buy 100,000 pounds. Huabi, Macgregor, and Huayi, etc., all had sales. The various banks also made deals for 100,000 pounds. There were also 200,000 yuan of remittances. However, the Dalian gang sold more than 100,000 yuan. Zhengjin also purchased it. Japanese companies, such as Mitsui, Kansen, Sumitomo, and Shanghai, etc., had almost all sold off, roughly hedging gold in the gold industry. However, Chinese merchants are still shorting British gold.</p>
<h3>Silver Market Without Much Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraphic dispatches, the price of silver bars did not rise or fall much, with the near and far terms both at 16 7/16 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 7/16 pence in British gold). There were no special changes at the landing, and trading was sparse. The market situation was calm, and the closing price was already idle. Citibank also did not have much movement. We also received New York telegraphic dispatches. The price of American silver rebounded by 0.125, with the spot price at $0.3575. The exchange rate between British and American dollars, and between American and British dollars, both fell by 0.0635, both at $4.855. British gold was still at 2 shillings 0.039375, and British Shanghai was 1 shilling, an increase of 0.125. 1 shilling 7 and a half pence. The Mumbai spot market had no telegraphs. At 10:10 a.m., Reuters telegraphed that the rate for Japanese gold to American dollars was $49.75, and British gold to American dollars was 2 shillings 0.05625. At 9:45 a.m., the Dentsu news agency also reported that there were no rising or falling prices. Details were omitted.</p>
<h3>Silver Dollar Transactions Were Not Vigorous, and Settlements Were Smooth</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Yesterday, the atmosphere for silver dollar transactions in the market showed some signs of recovery, because public bonds and securities were about to be delivered, and demand was high. Therefore, exchange rates also seemed to be favorable, but this was only temporary. In the future, when the time passes and the situation changes, they will still have to soften. Silver credit is currently very tight due to the long-term inflow and outflow of funds, and there is no way to verify the front-end padding. Moreover, the situation is full, so there is an opportunity for silver dismantling to also rise.</p>
<p>Interest Dismantling Price (Dollar Interest): The early market was at 7 mace 2 fen 7 li, and the noon market was slightly better at 7 hao 5, at 7 mace 2 fen 7 li 7 hao 5. (Silver Dismantling): The early and noon markets were both at 5 fen, which was weaker than the previous day by 1 fen. The front-end padding in the market was crowded, so it was difficult to turn over the front-end. Yesterday, the market did over 2 fen, and the banks' listed prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Currency Market Situation: The early market for Jiangsu small dollars was at 6 mace 4 fen 3 li 7 hao 5, and the noon market was at 6 mace 4 fen 3 li 5 hao. The result was slightly smaller than the previous noon by 1 hao 2 hu. The transactions made were 3,500 jiao in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the noon market. The early market for Guangdong small dollars was at 6 mace 3 fen 7 li 2 hao 5, and the noon market was at 6 mace 3 fen 7 li 5 hao. It was the same as the previous noon. The transactions made were 175,000 jiao in the early market and 50,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins:</p>
<p>Reverting short by 1,000 coins was 388,000 coins.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Yesterday, bank settlement news reported that Chinese merchants settled 2.7-2.8 million yuan in bills, foreign merchants settled more than 2 million yuan, and settlements still had 3 million yuan. Special funds settled 250-260,000 yuan, and various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and other items settled 1.1 million yuan. Out of the warehouse was 1.3 million yuan. Japanese banks settled 4.7 million yuan in various items, settled more than 100,000 yuan, and out of the warehouse was 500,000 yuan. Silver public houses settled 43.3 million yuan, head funds settled 440,000 yuan, various remittances settled 800,000 yuan, and cash settled 1.6-1.7 million yuan. (Dollar Funds): The early market for remittance bills was 1.43 million yuan, the noon market was 1.016 million yuan, the noon market for money tickets was 15,000 yuan, and the market price for 60,000 new coins plus 3 hao 7 hu. The early market for outside-market banknotes was 165,000 yuan, and the noon market was 75,000 yuan. Bank checks were 50-60,000 yuan, with the market price plus 1 hao 2 hu. The early market for interbank exchange head trading was 650,000 yuan, and the noon market was 600,000 yuan. The interbank dollar accounts received and settled over 1.7 million yuan. Banknotes recovered and issued over 2 million yuan. Public money houses settled over 5.2 million yuan, head dollar funds settled over 1.8 million yuan. The overnight lending rate for dollar funds was 1.3 million yuan. Small money houses traded 6-700,000 yuan, and customer sources were 500,000 yuan. Guanggong sent out 400,000 yuan, and the interior sent out 300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>News of Large-Scale Long-Term Transactions</h3>
<p>The amount of each long-term transaction expiring this time, whether for re-registration, recovery, or new transactions, could not be predetermined, so there was no way to guess. Now there are only two or three days left until the end of the total settlement period (i.e., the end of this month). If we continue to delay, I am afraid that we will not be able to catch up with the reason, so I heard that yesterday there were a large number of transactions, the details are recorded as follows: (1) The amount of long-term deposits in this street reached 20 million. In addition to those that had already been contacted a few days ago, the interest rate for transactions yesterday (except for those who wanted to hear the internal market price) was mostly around 5 taels. (2) The original amount of the long-term funds deposited in Shanghai was very large, estimated to be more than 20 million. This time, another 3-4 million was added, and the banks in Hangzhou and Shanghai were responsible for the arrangement. Most of the lenders were factories and customer gangs. (3) Chao, Shan, Jian, and Yu gangs absorbed long-term funds and re-registered, and the amount was very large. It is said that there were more than 10 million in total. The interest rate agreed upon yesterday ranged from 8 taels to 10 taels 5 qian. (4) There were also more than 2 million in letter and telegram transactions from Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other inland provinces. The interest rates were all above 10 taels, with the highest being 11 taels 2 qian 5 fen. (5) There were a total of 6-7 million long-term funds expiring in Hankou, and it was decided before that old account holders who wanted to continue would all re-register, and those who wanted to repay would listen to the fixed interest rate, ranging from 12.5 taels to 14 taels. (6) The amount of various mortgage long-term transactions was even greater and could not be calculated in detail. However, I heard that the interest rate was either 8 taels or 7.5 taels for Western interest, or 6.5 taels or 7.2 qian 5 fen for Chinese interest (the above refers to real estate mortgages). As for the floating mortgages of goods and securities, the interest rate was slightly higher, ranging from 7.5 taels to 9 taels.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Opened Trading in November Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday the market was very quiet... with slight ups and downs</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond futures for October were suspended due to preparations for delivery, and the futures for December had not yet been auctioned, so only the futures for November were available. Because all parties in the market had to prepare for delivery, the market situation was very quiet. Only more than 3.5 million in total was opened in the front and late markets. The 19th-year Customs Tax achieved not lonely, accounting for 1.71 million. The Reduction in Troops was only 700,000, and the others were sparse. In addition, the spot trading totaled 7,000 yuan. Because the demand for supply was very balanced, the front and late market fluctuations were very slight. Except for the spot market for the Elimination and Reduction in Troops, which rose by 8 jiao compared with the previous day, the others only had several jiao of ups and downs. In addition, the Securities Exchange first handled the settlement of October futures, held the delivery pre-settlement today, and opened new trading in December futures.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Turned From Weak to Beautiful</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and firmed in the afternoon, but actual sales were even more bleak. All the gangs were lifeless, so people's hearts were calm. However, the situation of American cotton was firm and bullish. Only the price of third-grade yarn fell sharply, and the sellers' bearish attitude was calm. In short, the demand for spot yarn was not smooth, and the bottom goods inevitably increased. It is difficult for the future to rise very much.</p>
<p>This Month's Standard Rose Uniquely by One or Two Taels: The opening market was flat and weak, and all the prices fell by two or three qian. The third panel was due to the sluggishness of third-grade yarn, and actual sales were light. All months fell by four, six, or seven qian. In the afternoon, the standard yarn market was slightly firmer. The market was tight because the price of raw cotton rebounded and people's hearts opened up. All months rose by four, six, seven, or eight qian. This month alone rose by one tael five qian. The total transactions totaled 26,850 bales. It was found that Zichu Guangfeng had 2,150 bales, Yicheng had 900 bales, Guidong had 1,650 bales, Gongtai had 900 bales, Yichang had 950 bales, and the rest had five, six, or seven hundred bales. Huairong had 2,400 bales, Shenji had 1,150 bales, and the rest had six or seven hundred bales. The recorded price is left.</p>

<p>Actual sales were only 920 bales, and the sales of spot yarn were still flat. It was found that all the gangs in the same industry had 920 bales, and the industry brought in 135 bales. The market was flat. Among the customer gangs, Yunnan brought in 220 bales, Sichuan brought in 55 bales, Changsha brought in 65 bales, Fujian brought in 45 bales, the interior brought in 130 bales, Guangdong brought in 185 bales, Qingdao brought in 75 bales, Shantou brought in 55 bales, and the Wei gang brought in 90 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Weak in the Morning and Beautiful at Night</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, but the trend of American cotton continued to be hard, so the buyers' attitude was strong. The Ningbo gang bought in and increased the code, and retail investors covered their shorts. Thus, the raised surface was tighter, and the buying atmosphere was extremely hot. However, some Han gangs had a slight hedge. In the afternoon, because Shenxin Factory bought more than 4,000 pieces of old Shaanxi cotton, people's hearts were greatly shocked, and each rose by three qian. How will the future be? It must rely on foreign cotton for transfer. Han Biao rose by two qian and a half. The Han Biao market opened in the early market, and retail investors continued to enter. Due to the continued rise of American cotton, the second and third markets fell by one qian each. In the afternoon, because a large batch of Shaanxi cotton was delivered, people's hearts were even more shaken, and each month rose by two or three qian. The total transactions totaled 60,800 dan. It was found that Ji Feng had 2,400 dan, Yu Chang had 4,000 dan, Tongxing had 3,000 dan, Dachangcheng had 2,100 dan, and Jinfeng had 3,500 dan. The rest had 1,700 or 800 dan.

<p>Spot Cotton Shenxin Absorbed a Lot: Shenxin had a source for absorbing spot cotton, including 2,600 bales of Yao cotton and 600 bales of Tong cotton. 4012 pieces of Shaanxi cotton at 33.25 were brought in by Shenxin Factory, and the spot goods were sent to the factory. Another 200 pieces at 33.75 were brought in by Ningxing Factory. Another 100 pieces at 35.00 were brought in by Dacheng Factory and sent to Changzhou. Another 600 bales of Shanghai Sea Tip at 33.29 were brought in by Dacheng Factory and sent to Changzhou. 500 bales of Yao cotton at 32.00 were brought in by the Guangdong gang.</p>
<h3>American Cotton and Third-Grade Diverged</h3>
<p>American cotton was firm again due to covering shorts. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, then weakened due to reactionary sages, and finally firmed again due to short covering. Futures rose by 8-16 pounds of sound. Spot rose by 10 pounds of sound. British cotton futures fell by three points, and spot rose by four points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by ten points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegraph on the 27th).</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Market Seen Firm and Weak</h3>
<p>More than 20 houses arrived in Zhabei yesterday. In the morning, the new japonica rice sold very well, and the price immediately increased by half a yuan, opening at 14.7 yuan. By the evening market, the sky cleared again, and people's hearts immediately returned to two jiao. The top goods only opened at 14.45 yuan, while the ordinary middle grades also changed with the weather and high goods. Therefore, the result was also good at about two jiao. The arrival of Bo Dao was still light, and the digestion was slightly prosperous. The market situation was firm. The Yang Xian and Bu Xian were seen going hand in hand due to various reasons, and the price also opened at 11.23 yuan, which was better than the previous day by half a jiao. Transactions were still possible. The demand for Shejian was flat. The price of zero dismantling was weak by one jiao. The large plate opened at 11.5 yuan. The arrival of Kejian was still sparse. This rice had been changed to other ports. The market situation was very tight. The arrival of Yuan at the head was even drier, and the sales floor was excellent. The disk rose by two jiao, opening high at 15.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 ships arrived in South Shanghai. The digestion in this street was still not prosperous. The Changxi new japonica rice also reported flat and weak. Only the special top was still hovering around the 14 yuan mark. The high-priced Bairu white rice from Sutong was firm, and the medium-subsequent repaired by Xiaojiao left the South Road. The two cities of rice production in Shanghai were still reported to be unprofitable, and the source was declining. The sales in this port were not smooth, and the market was always flat, only opening at 13.0 yuan. The sales of Yang Du Xian were slack and often weak, and the goods arriving at the port of Yinyuan were few. The hoisting sales were not weak, and the price reported stable.</p>
<h3>Standard Powder Market Entered a Stable Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the various months of the powder market had a tendency to stabilize. This month, the industry's short positions were gradually covered because delivery was approaching, but the standard was sluggish due to the environment. However, the various manufacturers considered that the price of especially high spot wheat was still not cheap, and the dark consumption of wheat entering and powder exiting was actually huge. Therefore, the only way to stop the car was to deal with the difficulties. This was the difficulty of the facts, not the manufacturers' difficulties. Observing the selling price of spot powder had already shouted to 2 taels 3 qian and a half, then the standard powder should also be allowed to be high. For this reason, those who understood the situation inside and outside the industry felt more cautious about the need for powder in the near future. The people's hearts were also brought up. Observing the later steps, in terms of spot powder, it must be necessary to re-emerge from the 3 qian mark. As a result, this month was better than the previous one by 7 li and a half, November was better by 1 fen and 2 li and a half, December was better by 1 fen, February was better by 5 li, and March was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Period Wheat Market Flat and High</h3>
<p>34 vehicles of powder are being prepared for delivery this month. Yesterday, the morning and afternoon market for period wheat showed signs of being initially weak and firm. October had already ended, and 34 vehicles had been prepared for delivery. The consignee was Fuxin, and the goods delivered belonged to the Chinese factory. The goods were foreign wheat. Because the local wheat was insufficient, the factory ordered foreign wheat and adjusted it. Now it arrived and was not used, but was delivered instead. I did not know what the intention was. In the early stages of the far months, the price of foreign wheat was still slightly lower at 2 or 3 jiao, and the market was flat. Subsequently, considering that this month still suddenly surged, people's hearts were gradually brought up. However, the market</p>

<p>Sun Hongyi Discusses His Escape</p>
<p>He Travels South for Leisure, With No Other Purpose</p>
<p>Effective Governance Lies Not in Much Talking, But in Diligent Practice</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Hongyi, who recently escaped danger and came to Shanghai from Tianjin, was interviewed by reporters yesterday. The following is a summary of the conversation:</p>
<p>Q: "We heard that you were detained by the Jin faction in Tianjin. What was the process?"</p>
<p>A: "When the central government's military campaign was pressing, Yan Xishan was deeply afraid that I would hinder his rear, so he secretly ordered Cui Tingxian, the mayor of Tianjin, to lure and detain me. After four months, when the Northeast Army mobilized and the situation came to an end, I escaped and went south."</p>
<p>Q: "What is your purpose in coming south?"</p>
<p>A: "Because I have lived in the north for a long time, some old friends have invited me by letter and telegram to come south for a tour. This time, I plan to take the opportunity to visit emerging industries in various parts of southern China, and to visit old friends from all sides. There is no other purpose."</p>
<p>Mr. Sun did not say that non-peaceful unification was insufficient to save China. Chairman Chiang's recent telegrams to Jiang and Yan are most appropriate. If proper methods can be planned and implemented in order, then the success of peaceful unification can be easily achieved. However, effective governance lies not in much talking, but in diligent practice.</p>

<p>Yu Qiaqing Proposes a Motion at the National Industrial and Commercial Conference</p>
<p>Submits a Request to the Authorities to Pay Attention to the National Goods Tax System</p>
<p>Implement Tariff Protection for Industrial and Commercial Policies</p>
<p>At the current National Industrial and Commercial Conference, Yu Qiaqing specially put forward an important motion entitled "Implementing Tariff Protection Policy," proposing to start with exempting national goods from export tax, and abolish the tax exemption and tax refund methods for foreign goods in order to compensate. The original text of the proposal is very long. The following excerpts its main points:</p>
<p>Regarding the export of national goods:</p>
<p>1.  It is determined that the principle of exporting national goods is not to levy taxes.</p>
<p>2.  There are the following exceptions where export taxes may be levied:</p>
<p>(A) Special products of our country, such as soybean cake from the three northeastern provinces, which are necessary for Japanese rice fields.</p>
<p>(B) Raw materials required by our country's industry, such as cotton, silkworm cocoons, and pig iron.</p>
<p>(C) Those necessary to maintain people's food or stabilize the monetary system, such as rice, wheat, or molten copper ingots.</p>
<p>Regarding the import of foreign goods:</p>
<p>1.  The current methods for imported foreign goods, such as rice, flour, gold, and silver, are all within the scope of tax exemption. It is proposed to change to graded taxation across the board. If our country encounters a poor harvest or the government needs to purchase large amounts of raw gold and silver to improve the monetary system, the government can temporarily issue an order to grant appropriate tax exemptions for a certain period.</p>
<p>2.  The method of refunding the import duty on foreign goods exported from China within three years should be abolished. The current existing ticket system in our country is limited to the re-export of original foreign goods, exclusively to maintain the interests of foreign merchants, while domestic industries are not allowed to refund taxes. The special tax refund measures for encouraging manufacturing in various countries are different and do not conform to the principles of modern politics. It is necessary to abolish them.</p>

<p>Han Falsely Used Letters to Seek Official Position</p>

Commander Xiong replied that old personnel in the department had been with him for a long time and it was not convenient to easily change them. Furthermore, the bandit suppression positions were concurrent and no one had been added for the time being, so it was difficult to arrange a position. He then sent a letter to Cheng expressing his gratitude for the recommendation. Subsequently, he received a reply from Cheng saying that he had not written a letter on behalf of Han and requested that the matter be investigated. Han was then questioned and detained, and will be sent to the military law department for punishment as a warning to others.</p>

<p>The Municipal Organization Department Stipulates Methods for Urging the Replacement of Party Certificates</p>
<p>Comrades Attending the Party Member Congress</p>
<p>Must Bring Party Certificates for Inspection</p>
<p>The Organization Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a notice to all levels of party headquarters in the city yesterday, stating that the first item of the resolutions of the sixth municipal organization committee meeting, "Urging the Replacement of Party Certificates," resolves that the municipal organization department should notify all districts and sub-departments that all comrades must bring their party certificates with them when attending the party member congress for inspection to see if they have expired and need to be replaced. The number of party certificates turned in for replacement in various districts has not been large recently. According to the statistics of the headquarters, the dates of issuance of the certificates are in July and August of the 17th year, and those that have reached the two-year expiration date are numerous. It is deeply feared that the comrades will fail to self-check and fail to replace them after the expiration date, resulting in disciplinary action. The sixth municipal organization committee meeting has specially proposed the replacement methods as above. It is hoped that all comrades will be notified to bring their party certificates to the party member congress for inspection and replacement to avoid disciplinary action after expiration. In addition to distribution, the notice is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<p>Various Trade Associations [Request Re-examination of Industry Regulations]</p>
<p>Lists Four Major Reasons</p>
<p>Please Ask Local Chambers of Commerce to Strive For</p>
<p>The various trade associations in this city previously held a joint meeting of representatives of various industries on the issue of industry regulations the day before yesterday. At that time, a committee was organized to maintain the industry regulations of the various trade associations, and a draft was prepared and submitted to the committee for revision and issuance. The committee has revised the letter and asked the municipal chamber of commerce to forward it to the relevant authorities for re-examination, and to inform the chambers of commerce in various places to strive for uniformity. The letter to the chambers of commerce in various places is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully, it was seen in the newspaper that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had replied to the Executive Yuan regarding the case of the resolutions of the member representative meeting that the industry regulations approved by the trade associations should be regarded as special regulations for the industry by the government, and that non-members should also abide by them. The reply stated that the industry regulations of the same industry are not laws and have no coercive force, and the regulations set by various industries often contain monopolistic characteristics or violate good customs. The supervisory authorities are not clear about the situation in various industries. Even if they have been filed, it is still difficult to guarantee that there will be no abuses. According to legal precedents, these bad industry regulations are difficult to protect even if they are appealed to the court. How can they be forced to be observed by all industries? Therefore, regardless of the content of the industry regulations, all those that have been approved by the government, whether they have joined the association or not, must abide by them, which will not only be of no help but will also cause disputes. The claim in the presentation that non-members should also abide by the industry regulations is really inappropriate. The supervisory authorities should still carefully review the regulations set by various industries with reference to good commercial practices in order to reduce disputes.</p>
<p>Having read the above, we are deeply shocked and concerned that the industry regulations are the lifeline of the trade associations. If they are not approved by the government and uniformly observed, it will inevitably lead to the disintegration of the associations. Our association has been seeking to understand the full text of the Ministry's reply and feels that it still lacks detailed understanding of commercial conditions and is even more contradictory to the law of trade associations. The mistakes in the Ministry's reply are actually due to excessive consideration. The main points are no more than four: one on the legal aspect, two on the monopolistic aspect, three on the official aspect, and four on the court aspect. Here are statements about the above four aspects one by one, hoping that you will appreciate them.</p>
<p>1. On the legal aspect, it is stated that Article 2 of the promulgated Trade Association Law states that the purpose of the trade association is to maintain and promote the common interests of the same industry and to correct the malpractices of business operations. However, there must be ways to promote public welfare and tools to correct malpractices. What are these methods and tools? That is the so-called industry regulations. If, as stated in the Ministry's reply, there is no recognition of the existence of industry regulations in the first place, then what will be the basis for implementing the promotion of public welfare and the correction of malpractices? If the association cannot promote the interests of the same industry or correct malpractices, why should there be such an association? Therefore, not recognizing the existence of industry regulations in the first place means not recognizing the existence of the association in the first place. The so-called "there must be a reason for everything" is also true. Moreover, it is stated in Article 1 of the General Principles of Civil Law that if there are no regulations in the law, customs shall be followed, and if there are no customs, legal principles shall be followed. The so-called customs naturally include commercial customs. The commercial customs of Industry A are different from those of Industry B. How is each industry's customs expressed? It is expressed through industry regulations. In other words, the industry regulations of each industry are the customs of the trade in that industry. In addition to commercial laws and regulations, they have a supplementary effect and do not violate public order. Regarding the legal aspect, the industry regulations of the same industry do not conflict. The Ministry's reply is inevitably overly considered and inappropriate, and it should be requested to be re-examined.</p>
<p>2. On the monopolistic aspect, it is believed that since industry regulations have been drafted by a majority of people in an industry, they are naturally considering the interests of the entire industry. Moreover, the participants are all experts who have experienced the situation firsthand and understand the relationship between interests and harms. The clauses they formulate are limited to the scope of interests of an industry, so there is naturally no monopoly on others. Within the scope of their own industry, once a resolution is passed, it should be observed by the public. If one or two companies want to seek their own interests and violate the industry regulations, it is difficult to escape the sanctions of the same industry. In other words, industry regulations are actually the only tool for eliminating monopolies. If, as stated in the Ministry's reply, industry regulations are equivalent to a formality, then those with strong financial resources can violate public opinion and monopolize the entire industry, making it impossible for the majority of industries with weak financial resources to establish a foothold. The result is that the Ministry's order does not recognize the existence of industry regulations, which in turn helps to create a monopoly for one or two ambitious business operators. This Ministry's reply is overly considered and inappropriate, and it should be requested to be re-examined.</p>
<p>3. On the official aspect, it is believed that the supervisory authorities are in a supervisory position. When industry regulations are submitted for filing, the supervisory authorities will naturally carefully review them in order to exercise their powers and will never act rashly. The Ministry's reply, "There may be unclear points," seems to be too speculative. If, as stated, the Ministry's order completely holds a skeptical attitude towards the supervisory powers exercised by the supervisory authorities, then are not the various supervisory powers entrusted to the relevant authorities by the Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law almost the same as being in name only? It is a mistake to make the supervisory powers of the government almost unrecognizable based on a single thought and suppression of words. This Ministry's reply is overly considered and inappropriate, and it should be requested to be re-examined.</p>
<p>4. On the court aspect, it is believed that trade associations have legal personality and have the ability to enjoy rights and assume obligations within the limits of the regulations. Industry regulations are the embodiment of the public opinion of an industry and also the expression of the commercial customs of an industry. Even based on the facts of the judicial authorities in this city, commercial disputes are generally consulted on the commercial practices of various industries as a yardstick for judgment. This kind of situation has been seen in many cases of chambers of commerce throughout history. The Ministry's reply that it is difficult to protect even if appealing to the court is to make the same industry lose confidence in the concept of industry regulations on the one hand, and to destroy the procedures of the merchants' customs by the court on the other hand. Destroying the organization from the ground up. This Ministry's reply is overly considered and inappropriate, and it should be requested to be re-examined.</p>
<p>It is submitted that if these industry regulations are not requested to be approved and ordered to be observed uniformly, regardless of whether they have joined the association or not, then not only will those who have not joined the association not want to abide by them, but those who have already joined the association will also withdraw from the association one after another, and the organization of the association will be seen to disappear immediately. Everyone who joins an association is subject to restrictions, so how can they be allowed to be unconstrained if they leave the association? Even a three-foot-tall child can understand this. The so-called "unconstrained" is nothing more than a monopolistic aspect that disrupts cargo prices, making it impossible for China's commerce to ever be rectified. When the association thinks of this, it cannot help but shudder with fear.</p>
<p>Reading the Premier's instructions, it is absolutely unacceptable to only know individual freedom and not have group freedom. Trade associations are commercial associations. If we want to rectify commerce, there should be a kind of agreement for the merchants in the industry. This kind of agreement maintains the existence of a meeting, which is the articles of association. It maintains the public interest of an industry's business, which is the industry regulations. If industry regulations are suspected of being monopolistic, it is no different from saying that merchants should only have individual freedom and do not need to have group freedom. Its theory is not worth arguing in detail. At this time of political training, each industry's self-regulation of industry regulations and requesting government approval to express the ability to create and formulate is actually a good phenomenon for the country. Those in power should reward them without delay. Our association is for the sake of maintaining public interest, for the sake of correcting business malpractices, and for the sake of the future of Chinese commerce, confirming that the industry regulations are formulated to adapt to the needs of the commercial environment, and the industry regulations must be fully effective if they are observed uniformly by the members inside and outside the association. After consulting with the same thoughts, the corresponding letter is requested to be submitted to the various competent authorities, and the industry regulations approved by the trade associations should be regarded as the special regulations for the industry by the government, and all those who have not joined the association should also abide by them uniformly. Please re-examine the case so that we can follow it, and we hope that you will forward it to the chambers of commerce in various places to strive for uniformity. We will be deeply grateful for your assistance.</p>
<p>Trade associations must attach membership certificates from the municipal chamber of commerce when registering</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to the various trade associations yesterday, stating: This chamber previously presented to the Social Affairs Bureau that when the various trade associations completed their reorganization, this chamber would give them a certificate of proof as a check when applying to the competent authorities for registration, and that the Social Affairs Bureau should attach this certificate when each association applies for registration. After approval, it was deemed that the certificate was limited to reorganized groups. This chamber has no way to issue certificates for newly organized associations. In order to maintain a close relationship between various trade associations and this chamber, it is proposed to change it to the membership certificate issued by this chamber when each association applies to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration. On October 17, the membership certificate form was attached and presented to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. On the 27th of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the application and the membership certificate form should be handled accordingly. Please be informed of this approval.</p>
<p>National Quarantine Service Publishes Third Rabies Report</p>
<p>The third rabies report by Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the National Quarantine Service of Shanghai, has been published, and its text is as follows:</p>
<p>This year's mild rabies in Shanghai has now come to an end. There have been no further cases since the last case of rabies on October 19. A total of 127 cases of true rabies have been discovered in Shanghai, of which 16 were fatal, accounting for 12.60% of the total. The Shanghai resident population reaches 3 million, and only this number has been infected. It can be seen that this year's epidemic is not prevalent. This office has been paying close attention to the situation of this epidemic since the beginning of June. A detailed specialized academic report will be published soon. The general situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This summer was unusually hot, and abdominal diseases other than rabies did not exceed the abnormal situation.</p>
<p>(2) At the beginning of June, this office immediately conducted detailed investigations in various parts of the city to find the vectors of rabies transmission. A total of 1,200 people with no obvious diseases had their feces examined by this office. Various microorganisms resembling rabies were found in the feces, but no true rabies microorganisms were found until August 28. The first case of true rabies occurred on that day.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to the above-mentioned 1,200 people whose feces were examined, the excreta of 400 people suffering from dysentery and 51 boatmen arriving in Shanghai from the Chinese coast were also thoroughly examined by this office. It was determined that there were no rabies microorganisms among them.</p>
<p>(4) After the first case of true rabies was discovered on August 28, this office took the excreta of patients suffering from summer diseases in various hospitals and examined them one by one. As a result, it was found that 127 of them contained rabies bacteria. This office has now determined that those suffering from rabies are this number. Because this office has sent Dr. Yang to collect the excreta of patients in various hospitals and families of patients in order to be comprehensive. There was no such careful method in previous years, so even if this report is slightly inaccurate, it will not exceed eleven.</p>
<p>(5) During the rabies epidemic, this office conducted successive investigations of 25 people who had daily contact with patients infected with the epidemic and 151 patients suffering from dysentery in hospitals in order to find the source of transmission. The results of the examination of their surroundings, milk, and drinking water in twelve places showed that, except for one person who could be identified as a vector, the rest were not.</p>
<p>(6) Of the 127 cases of rabies, 87 occurred in the Chinese-administered areas (Greater Shanghai), 26 in the International Settlement, and 14 in the French Concession (based on the patient's residence).</p>
<p>(7) Among these 127 patients, 25 were between the ages of 24 and 27, and 20 were between 20 and 24. From this, it can be inferred that people are most susceptible to this epidemic after adolescence and before adulthood. As for the gender of the patients, 70 out of 127 were male and 57 were female.</p>
<p>(8) The number of vaccinations against rabies carried out this year in the Chinese areas and the British and French concessions has reached a recorded number of 537,034: 404,675 in the Chinese areas (Greater Shanghai), 66,338 in the International Settlement, and 66,021 in the French Concession. As for the impact of this preventive method (which was started on May 1) on the occurrence of this year's rabies, it remains to be observed.</p>
<p>(9) The research work carried out by this office's chemical laboratory this year has greatly contributed to the preparations for next year. After this research, it has a more accurate understanding of all things related to rabies than in previous years. With this accurate and novel knowledge, it will be able to do its best in epidemic prevention in the future to seek happiness for the public.</p>
<p>(10) I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the various municipal authorities that have assisted this office with great care, and I am especially grateful to Dr. Qiaoteng, Dr. Fodiya, Dr. Chen Wu, and the directors of various hospitals for granting this office research data. This office has benefited greatly.</p>

<p>Relocation of the Belgian Embassy's Shanghai Office</p>
<p>Sievers, the representative of the Belgian Minister in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying that its Shanghai office has been relocated to the Hotel Caisse on Pushi Road as of today.</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Investigates the Customs of Compradors Ordering Goods</p>
<p>Requests for Orders and Order Forms are Different in Nature</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to the letter from the Special District Local Court yesterday, stating: The letter from your court on the 21st of this month, No. 3708, approved the case of a Western merchant and a comprador in a dispute over ordering goods. Regarding whether the request for orders from the comprador to the foreign company has the same effect as the order form, it is necessary to investigate the customs and reply. A sample of the Western order request form is attached. After approval, the department has been instructed to investigate in detail. It has now been found that according to the usual practice of foreign companies, when a customer orders goods, the comprador must issue a request form (Offer) stating the goods required by the customer and the price, and request the company to promise. The company will then send an email to foreign manufacturers. If the reply shows that the price is compatible, then an order will be placed with the customer. This is the most common procedure, so the nature of this request form is only a notice. The effective period is always limited to the arrival of the company's price inquiry reply, and the time for the arrival of the reply is at most three or four days. Therefore, this request form includes a column for answering within a certain time. According to custom, the comprador should be responsible within this specified period. After this, it will be invalidated and cannot be compared with the order form. The results of the investigation have been prepared and replied to your court for your consideration and handling.</p>
<p>County Reorganization Committee Meeting</p>
<p>56th Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee held its 56th committee meeting yesterday morning. Tao Yishan presided. After performing the rituals, the matters were reported briefly. Then, the motions were discussed.</p>
<p>(1) Committee member Jiang Yanqiu proposed that the rules of procedure for the secretariat office submitted for review at the 55th meeting have been reviewed and completed. Please approve the proposal. Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>(2) The Organization Department proposed that Huang Xingrang, the custodian of the Third District Party Headquarters, requested to resign and should be approved. It is proposed to appoint Zhang Yi to fill the vacancy. Please approve the proposal. Resolution: Passed.</p>
<p>(2) (omitted)</p>
<p>(4) Please specify the date of the 15th Party-Government Dialogue Meeting. Resolution: It was decided to hold it at 1:00 PM on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>(5) (omitted) The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Baoshan County Government Meeting</p>
<p>The Baoshan County Government held a county government meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Qiu Mingjiu, Shen Jing, Qian Tianpeng, Wang Cheng, Luo Wenbing, Han Bingheng, Xue Ying, Qiu Shuqi, Ma Mengyuan, Xu Liangxi, and Ji Zhonghe attended. County Magistrate Qiu presided and Zhang Ruyu recorded. The resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Reporting Items)</p>
<p>(1) According to the report of the Finance Bureau, the sixteen-year mangxun case requests that a notice be issued in order to offset the municipal government subsidy fee. The Finance Department issued directive No. 2235, stating that due to the municipal government's withholding of subsidy fees, the various organs were unable to maintain their operations. The department has issued subsidies for two months under the provincial funds. The provincial treasury is more exhausted than the local treasury. All arrearages of mangcao from the sixteenth year, June, July, August, and September should be immediately delivered to the provincial treasury.</p>
<p>(Discussion Items)</p>
<p>(1) The Finance Department ordered that the funds for subsidizing and guiding the organization of people's groups be determined by the special envoy sent by the Provincial Party Department and the Construction Department and the County Party Department to subsidize 80 yuan per month, with the Party Department and the government each paying half. From which funds should the government's half be disbursed? Resolution: It was resolved that half of the County Government's responsibility should be decided from the first item of the County Local Fee Budget for the nineteenth year, the Party Department's temporary fee item.</p>
<p>(1) The chairman submitted the issue of an ancient monument from the Ming Dynasty at the gate of the North Gate. It was found to be a chronicle of the construction of this city and is very relevant to local literature. If it is allowed to be exposed to wind and rain, it would be a great loss to preserve cultural relics. How should it be preserved? Please make a public decision. Resolution: It was resolved to have the Education Bureau handle it properly.</p>
<p>(1) The chairman submitted the issue that the public school jointly run by the various bureaus of the county government must graduate by the end of January. Which agency should issue the certificates? Resolution: It was resolved to issue them in the name of the school, but the certificate should be signed by the heads of the various agencies and stamped with their private seals to show credibility.</p>
<p>Seamen's General Union Convenes Meeting of Various Groups Today</p>
<p>Discussing Seamen's Pay Increase</p>
<p>Taigu Has Agreed to Add Four Yuan</p>
<p>The case of foreign ship Chinese seamen requesting a pay increase has not been resolved for more than a month since it was proposed last month. Jardine Matheson and Nisshin have not given any definite indications. Taikoo Company has invited representatives of the union to meetings several times without results. It has also asked Chen Bogang, chairman of the Shipping Association, and Yu Qiaqing to serve as mediators. Yu has been very busy traveling back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai recently, so it has not been resolved. Last Thursday, Taikoo again convened representatives of the Seamen's Union to discuss it. The Westerners still only agreed to add three yuan. Because the amount was still far from the requested amount, the meeting broke up without results. The next day, Wang Yongsheng was sent to meet with Yu Qiaqing. According to the reply, he would reply after meeting with the Taikoo Taipan.</p>
<p>Because the Seamen's Union had been waiting for several days and had not seen Yu's reply, Wang Yongsheng was sent to the Sanbei Company at 11:00 a.m. yesterday to visit Yu. After meeting, it was said that I (Yu himself) would return from Taikoo immediately. Taikoo Taipan is currently agreeing to add four yuan from September. Can you (referring to Wang) agree? Wang replied that he had to report back to the union and ask for the consent of various groups before replying. After Wang reported to the union, the union decided to convene an emergency joint meeting of the General Nanshe, Yan Ying Nanshe Nanjun An Gongsuo, Beijun An Gongsuo, Shanglun Lianyi Association, and Shipping Jiuan Institute at the Seamen's General Union on Qiujiang Road, Zhabei at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss the above issues. According to Wang, the reason why Taikoo agreed to add four yuan is because he saw the hard work of Chen and Yu in mediating, and perhaps it could be passed. Whether it can be resolved will be known after the meeting tomorrow (i.e., today).</p>
<p>Twists and Turns in the Grading of Chinese Silk</p>
<p>Four Committee Members on the Chinese Side Resign</p>
<p>Chinese raw silk trade has never had grades, and the brand names of various silk factories have been used as pricing standards. Since various countries have paid attention to raw silk grading, the Shanghai raw silk market has gradually tended to the issue of grading. Japanese and American silk merchants have repeatedly convened meetings to discuss and their opinions have gradually become consistent.</p>
<p>The Chinese silk grading has been organized by Miao Zhongxiu, director of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, who invited representatives of Chinese and foreign silk merchants to form a Chinese Silk Grading Discussion Committee. The committee members on the Chinese silk merchants' side are Shen Huachen, Huang Jin臣, Zhu Jing'an, Wu Shenbo, Zhou Junmei, Li Shuchu, Xu Shouyi, and other seven people. The committee members on the export silk merchants' side are Hart (Taipan of Mitsui Bussan), Pulatonan (Taipan of Jardine Matheson), Xihuashi (Taipan of Qianli Foreign Firm), Zhu Weigu (Weicheng Company), and other four people. Miao Zhongxiu, Li An, Li Yaobang, and Lane (technician from the American Silk Inspection Office, transliteration) were appointed from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, totaling 15 committee members. Zhou Junmei was elected as the chairman of the committee, Miao Zhongxiu was the secretary, and it was decided that each committee member would solicit opinions from all parties. At the same time, the testing stock of the silk inspection office would carry out various tests, and the discussion was in progress.</p>
<p>It is learned that because silk factories oppose the implementation of the public inspection by export manufacturers and counties, four of the seven committee members, including Shen Huachen, Huang Jin臣, Zhu Jing'an, and Wu Shenbo, have officially resigned from the committee. As a result, the Chinese silk grading work has been suspended.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Committee Schedules Meeting in Beijing</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk factories have recently suffered increasingly severe losses due to sluggish silk sales, and they have been unable to maintain their operations. They have elected representatives to come to Shanghai to join the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Relief Committee to publicly discuss submitting a request to the government to issue 10 million yuan of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai factory silk industry bonds for relief. Fifteen representatives have publicly elected Shen Huachen, Huang Jin臣, Zhu Jing'an, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Jinfan, Chen Bingruo, Qian Fenghao, Jiang Laixian, Zhu Mou先, and other nine people to be representatives to petition in Beijing. They are scheduled to depart on the night train on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>It is learned that among the nine representatives, Shen Huachen, Huang Jin臣, Wang Xiaolai, and Qian Fenghao are silk industry experts on this Industrial and Commercial Conference and have been invited by the Industrial and Commercial Conference. They will also take the same train to Beijing that night. Therefore, in addition to asking for the issuance of silk industry bonds and submitting petitions to the departments in Beijing, Shen Huang and other four representatives must also attend the Industrial and Commercial Conference on November 1. They will stay in Beijing for about a week and will return to Shanghai after the Industrial and Commercial Conference closes.</p>
<p>The Shang Nanchuan Lace Industry Joint Association is Established</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Lace Trade Associations in Chuansha, Pudong, Shanghai Nanhui was established on October 26 at the Chuansha Xi Town Farmers Education Center. Zhang Yunzhi was elected as the temporary chairman. Li Jusheng, a representative of the Party Department, attended the meeting to provide guidance, discuss the draft articles of association, rectify industry regulations, register patterns, rectify products, stipulate industry interest rates and labor wages, submit a request to the government for protection, assist in promotion and sales, and stipulate grade standards to maintain commodity credit. The proposal was passed, and seven executive committee members were elected: Xu Jiu, Zhang Yunzhi, Zhang Shouxi, Zhu Shaoting, Tao Bing, Zhang Longshan, and Gu Ming. Three supervisory committee members were elected: Du Boyan, Zhang Boxun, and Tao Yumen.</p>
<p>New Method for American Residents to Elect Candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>When the Municipal Council was re-elected this year, because there were three American candidates, the votes were scattered. As a result, only one person was elected, losing a seat compared to previous years. Now, various American groups in this city have followed the suggestion of Mr. Ke Ninghan, the American Consul General, to discuss and determine a method for recommending candidates for the Municipal Council. Sixteen people, including Mr. Falan Shu, have been elected to form the Municipal Council Election Committee. In the future, whenever there is a vacancy for an American director in the Municipal Council, the committee will nominate one person for each vacancy six weeks in advance. If there are any candidates nominated outside the</p>

<p>Youth Corner Northern Tour Impressions Su Ling (19) On Sun Island</p>
<p>The Songhua River in summer is very lively. Yachts dart back and forth on the river surface. Sun Island is full of people enjoying water sports. Two or three months ago, the Songhua River was probably still frozen with thick ice, and Sun Island was still a desolate beach.</p>
<p>On the Daowai side of the river, cargo ships and steamers are densely packed. Naturally, the riverbank is also full of laborers bustling about. However, on the Daoli side of the river, there are small boats, small motorboats, and small sailboats. The riverbank is full of tourists. These small boats all have Russian names, mostly women's names, such as "Lilianweiya", "Sifuchejia", etc.</p>
<p>That day, Ou and the others invited me to go to Sun Island to play. They also brought fishing rods.</p>
<p>Sun Island is filled with simple houses made of wooden planks. These houses are all restaurants, KABE. Some are very elaborate, and some are simple. But the most interesting thing is that every restaurant has music (except for the small restaurants opened by Chinese people). The large ones have a quartet, and the smallest ones have an accordion player or a mandolin player. And the waitresses can dance with you. This is very primitive and interesting. Everyone wears bathing suits and bare feet, dancing on the soft grass mats in the green shade and sunlight to the monotonous music.</p>
<p>Zhao and the others went swimming, Luo and the others went for a walk, and threw the fishing rods on the shore. Ou and I sat down in a KAPE opened by a Russian. Because there was music inside, and the mandolin player was a master. Ou told me about the content of the tunes they played, especially the one called "Moscow", which they loved to play the most, and people loved to listen to it the most. The entire melody is full of sorrow, memories, and fantasy. It is said that this is a mourning song, a lament for the Moscow capital destroyed by the Red Army, a nostalgic fantasy for the past magnificent buildings, royal palaces, etc., and a sorrowful lament for the destruction of everything now. In reality, the composer is mourning himself.</p>
<p>We each drank a glass of vodka and then a glass of beer, and we were already quite tipsy. When the music in this KAPE stopped, the music from the neighboring one started.</p>
<p>There were many Gypsy women telling fortunes with playing cards. Their yellow skin, dissolute behavior, and flowery, romantic clothes reminded me of Carmen written by Mérimée.</p>
<p>We came out of the KAPE and saw Ou drawing a divination stick. He threw two coppers in and drew one, but he didn't open it to read the divination text because he saw Miss Wang in a KAPE over there. He gave it to her. Ou told me that the divination sticks were in Russian and contained very interesting things, such as "You are getting married soon," "Your man has run away," etc. But there were also very angry things. I don't know what Ou gave Miss Wang.</p>
<p>The more it got towards evening, the more tourists there were. Chinese ladies are afraid of the sun, so they only come out in the evening. And Chinese men, except for a few who come to swim, mostly dress very smartly to take a look at the flesh of these Russian women.</p>
<p>Zhao and Luo had all met up, so we hired a boat to return to Jiangnan to visit the Eastern Palace.</p>
<p>Zhi He</p>
<p>During the grand Fudan 25th Anniversary Celebration, in addition to the achievement exhibition, photography, and fun fair, another very interesting event was the opening of the Eastern Palace (the girls' dormitory of Fudan University), which caused a sensation throughout the school and was fantasized by the male students as a mysterious tower. This allowed the male students who usually lingered in front of the Eastern Palace, able to look but not touch, to feast their eyes. The following describes the flowery details not found in various newspapers, published in the Youth Corner for those who are concerned about the Eastern Palace to read.</p>
<p>Male students shouting "Enter the Palace." On the first day of the Eastern Palace's opening, I, also feeling a sense of curiosity, made a special appointment with my friend Tao Lin to rush to visit the Eastern Palace. Approaching the Eastern Palace, people were already crowded, almost blocking the path. In the noisy voices, we heard shouts of "Enter the Palace!" "Enter the Palace!" Haha, I thought, if these opportunistic students were heard by the princesses, they would definitely scold you with a "Tear your mouth!" But in fact, we did enter the Palace.</p>
<p>Inside the Eastern Palace, running up the palace steps is a elegantly and exquisitely decorated reception room, said to be prepared for princes and marquises to visit the palace mistress. Entering the reception room is the princess's bedroom. Their arrangement is roughly four palace beds in each bedroom. Their clean white sheets are embroidered with charming letters in the four corners, and some also have beautiful red flower balls tied to the four ends of the bed frame, giving the general viewers a lingering, yearning feeling after the visit.</p>
<p>Ms. Zuo received us cordially. Tao and I visited one room after another. Although there were elegant and beautiful decorations, we were ultimately filled with a sense of "people gone, building empty." At that time, most of the princesses had escaped out of shyness, which made us feel a little disappointed in our enthusiasm. But soon, we were comforted, happily. In bedroom 102, we finally discovered a pleasant atmosphere. As I was about to run into the bedroom door, a graceful and smiling lady greeted us very politely and said sincerely and cordially, "Please sit down." Of course, we sat down without any hesitation. Tao seemed to have forgotten something and suddenly stood up from the chair he was about to sit on and asked, "Madam, what is your surname?" She answered with a smile, "Zuo." "May I ask your given name?" Tao stubbornly continued to ask. "Shaofen." Only from her mouth did we know that this was the famous socialite of Fudan University, Ms. Zuo Shaofen. Her quiet demeanor really made my heart beat faster. We were silent for a while, looking at the decorations on the desk. In this atmosphere, a burst of voices suddenly broke through. We saw many strange young men in suits running in. One of them was carrying a camera. At this time, Tao and I also got up and said goodbye to Ms. Zuo. According to Tao, the young man carrying the camera was Zhang Youde, a reporter from the Shih Pao Pictorial.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman temporarily acting as a perfume thief. At that time, Baohua Jilu One (寶華寄廬一), i.e. one of the male dormitories, "A certain gentleman stole two bottles of perfume from a certain lady's bedroom and was exposed by the students on the spot. The onlookers called him a perfume thief, and it caused a sensation throughout the palace for a while."</p>
<p>Ms. Wang denies the Eastern Palace. On the desk in bedroom 120, we found a very interesting note that read, "We are a girls' dormitory. Please don't call it the Eastern Palace anymore in the future." Miss Wang is very funny, taking advantage of this lively tour to give the male students a warning. Now I would like to apologize to Miss Wang. In this article, I have called your place the Eastern Palace again. I deserve to be beaten, I deserve to be beaten. I will definitely not call it the Eastern Palace next time! (End)</p>
<p>Fun Fair Wang Dao</p>
<p>Walking into the fun fair twice in a row, I really felt happy and feasted my eyes, and also gave me a lot of thoughts.</p>
<p>School life is really too dull and uninteresting, especially for us who study politics and economics. Besides having to drill into books and lectures every day, to be honest, there is only boredom and boredom, and it is even more unbearable when people are quiet, the night is deep, and the autumn moon is bright.</p>
<p>Too</p>
<p>We are over twenty years old. Who doesn't feel the need for sex? Those who have wives and lovers are naturally exceptions. The most pitiful are the general bachelors, who can't help but have sexual feelings but can't achieve sexual desires. Therefore, after stepping into the extreme sexual wilderness, as long as there is an opportunity, they become crazy and can't control themselves. If you don't believe it, look at the scene in the fun fair.</p>
<p>The news that Dafasi (大法四) held a celebration of the sports championship fun fair last night spread like wildfire, and suddenly stirred up more than seven hundred male and female students. In the evening, as dusk approached, carrying infinite mystery, hearts beating, they all crowded towards the first classroom in groups. The situation was really more lively than last week's academic lecture. A large clock perched on the roof clearly indicated that it was almost seven o'clock. The first classroom, which was usually the largest, was already crowded with people. The hot laughter filled the room, causing the classroom to undergo a chemical reaction, emitting a suffocating atmosphere. But these, these, are nothing to worry about. A burst of applause only urged the opening to start sooner.</p>
<p>The school gate was still as dark as usual. From time to time, two or three vehicles with two headlights sped into the school. The students constantly applauded to show</p>
<p>Page 26</p>
<p>what kind of gadgets were brought in the carriages.</p>
<p>The result of the busy work in the dressing room was the beginning of the fun fair. The back rows of seats had already been stacked in a pyramid style. Thousands of faces expressing different expressions, fat and thin, large and small, all wore the same smile. Doubled eyes were destined to focus on the raising of the curtain.</p>
<p>"Clap...clap...clap..." A burst of applause. The portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen was revealed on the stage. Surrounded by the national flag and the party flag on the left and right, everyone performed the ceremony. Then, the chairman's report was not elaborate, and suddenly a burst of boos and hisses arose. At the same time, chaotic talking and laughter followed, forcing the chairman to finish hastily and retreat quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, the curtain seemed to have a spirit. Through repeated opening and closing, it temporarily cleaned up the chaotic atmosphere again. A burst of torrential applause. The fun fair had officially begun on the stage.</p>
<p>I saw the butterflies fluttering lightly, the roses overflowing with powdery fragrance, and the exquisite and lively white rabbit occupying the front of the stage, singing and dancing beautifully.</p>
<p>"I love Sister Rose...I love..." The white rabbit sang, and at the same time slowly walked up and bowed lightly.</p>
<p>"Good ah...good...good..." The whole place was in an uproar.</p>
<p>"Sister Rose also sang, facing the butterfly,</p>
<p>"I love your lake-colored beautiful clothes, I love your exquisite and lively dancing..." At the same time, she danced with her light gauze.</p>
<p>The whole audience applauded and cheered. Continuous strange noises followed. As soon as the act ended, Sister Rose was so frightened that she ran back, the butterfly flew away in shock, and the white rabbit scurried back into its hole. The strange noises under the stage shook the entire place intensely.</p>
<p>Act after act passed, and the enthusiastic mood of the whole place also increased endlessly. The human flesh mountain collapsed and rebuilt several times, and the wonderful performances on the stage reached the most cutting-edge, which was exactly the white-hot period in Japanese mouths.</p>
<p>Cheers, applause, and all kinds of strange noises were especially clamorous, almost piercing the roof. In the indescribable madness of the whole place, the thing of the ×× singing and dancing troupe had already begun. At this time, one or two thousand sharp eyes involuntarily focused on the pair of fleshy legs shaking on the stage. A tight-fitting dance dress pressed the bulging fat inside.</p>
<p>Push. Therefore, the cheers and boos were as loud as spring thunder.</p>
<p>She sang,</p>
<p>"Don't stop your hands, go and spray all our blood to demand the life we love..."</p>
<p>"Good...good...ah..."</p>
<p>"Brother, where are your hands, embrace me..."</p>
<p>"Brother, where are your eyes, look at me..."</p>
<p>"Brother, where are your cheeks, snuggle against me..."</p>
<p>"Brother, where are your lips, kiss me..."</p>
<p>"Wow...la...la...good ah...good ah...good..."</p>
<p>This is a singing and dancing star who enjoyed a great reputation two years ago. Although her beauty is gradually aging, her charm is no longer what it used to be. The two autumn waves that had once intoxicated thousands of young people still retained an indescribable charm. The two naked jade legs had already consumed how much beautiful youth, but they still displayed their trembling power. Her singing voice carried a sharp edge, so as to seduce every young man's red heart until the last drop of blood was exhausted. It was a pity that all the young people in the hall could only shout wildly, jump around, and go crazy.</p>
<p>Ah, what an authoritative woman!</p>
<p>The grand event did not end until twelve o'clock. A car flew out of the school gate. The applause was still chasing after each other on the lawn.</p>
<p>After all, the feast for the eyes was over. In less than two days, we were delighted to meet the grand anniversary celebration of Fudan University, which completely annihilated a gymnasium. The war clouds seemed to be celebrating the ascendance of peace with only wild revelry and hot dancing.</p>
<p>The wild cheers, enthusiastic applause, and the throwing of paper butterflies, all kinds of unrestrained excitement, still remain in this image.</p>
<p>Ah, in this period of suffering, it is most difficult to have such an opportunity to vent. The exposure of sexual feelings, the expression of passionate youth, no wonder the fun fairs of a certain university in the past were always singing and dancing programs from beginning to end.</p>
<p>"There are ultimately no beautiful women in books, no golden mansions in books" is what caused the madness of college students.</p>
<p>Jiao Tong University Sends Lecturers to Study Abroad</p>
<p>Jiao Tong University, considering that the material civilization of various advanced countries in Europe and the United States has reached its peak and new inventions are heard of every day, while our country lags far behind, and the university bears the responsibility of being the highest institution of industrial science in our country, in addition to vigorously promoting the students' level of competence and enriching the school's facilities by hiring knowledgeable professors, has decided to send several lecturers to study in Europe and the United States every year to conduct in-depth research on new inventions and introduce them to our country. This year, it plans to send Xu Guobao, a physics lecturer at the school, to Germany to study X-ray science and applied chemistry; Feng Hexiu to the United States to study high-voltage electricity and radio; and Yang Shiqing to the United States to study accounting and transportation. The three gentlemen are all graduates of the school and have obtained degrees after studying abroad. The purpose of this re-dispatch abroad is not to obtain any degrees, but to specialize in research and investigation, with a maximum period of two years. After returning to the country, they will serve as professors at the school. It is heard that next year, Dean Qiu Weiyu and Professor Zhang Gongjiu will also be dispatched abroad. In the future, professors who have returned to the school for more than five years will have to be sent to study for one year and then return to the country, and will be sent again every five years. Science is changing rapidly every day, and it is difficult to seek its essence without continuous research. The school also believes that for thousands of years, our country has rarely made inventions in material civilization, and the government and responsible national universities do not have special researchers, so it plans to allow teachers and staff who are outstanding in learning and have the ambition to research and invent to study abroad to fulfill their talents. It is heard that after Mr. Xu and others go abroad, not only will all expenses abroad be fully borne by Jiao Tong University, but also the current salaries of Mr. Xu and others will be fully retained to prevent those who study abroad from having any worries, so that they can concentrate on research and succeed.</p>
<p>Jiao Tong University Subsidizes Students' Overcoats</p>
<p>Jiao Tong University believes that students in the school should wear school uniforms to show neatness and express the spirit of the school. Therefore, starting from this semester, each person will be charged a uniform fee of fifteen yuan to tailor a set of university student uniforms according to the uniform style promulgated by the Ministry of Education. In the future, students must wear them to class, meetings, etc., and it is also appropriate for students to wear uniforms when going out. Students believe that this move by the school authorities is very beneficial to the students, so they all expressed their welcome and obeyed the order. However, as the weather gradually gets colder, students who wear uniforms must add overcoats. At present, everything is expensive, and an overcoat costs no less than forty or fifty yuan. If students have already paid the uniform fee of fifteen yuan, and then make an overcoat, it will be difficult for students' parents to bear the burden at this time when all industries are declining. But in fact, it is impossible not to make an overcoat. Therefore, the Student Union sent a letter to the president asking him to subsidize each person with an overcoat to show consideration for the students and to prevent the students from disobeying the order to wear uniforms, which would hinder the school's reputation. The president first thought that this was a time when the war had just ended and railway income had been greatly reduced, so the salaries of railway department employees were calculated at 80%, but the funds for Jiao Tong University were not discounted at all. It could not be said that it was not generous to Jiao Tong University. If he submitted a request to increase the uniform fee again, he was afraid of being rejected and politely declined to thank the students. The students requested again and again, and the president finally agreed because the students' request was really unavoidable, so he agreed to find a way to raise funds and make students' overcoats on schedule. It is heard that the school has more than 800 students, so this overcoat fee is quite considerable.</p>
<p>Dietary Cooperation of Fudan University Students</p>
<p>In this era of expensive things, it is not easy to be a university student. To be honest, it would be difficult to get by with less than two hundred yuan per semester. After spending such a huge amount of money, life should naturally be much more comfortable, but the reality is not necessarily so, it is simply suffering in human hell. Take eating as an example. The packaged meal of ten yuan per month does not even have porridge in the morning. It is a great fortune to get the rice as hard as iron and the uncooked vegetables into your mouth early. Hygiene is of course out of the question, and what about the taste? It is too bad. May I ask, ten yuan is not a small amount after all, but the price obtained is like this. The reason for this is of course that merchants are making too much profit from it.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this semester, the students from Chongming, Shanghai, and Qidong, who have always had strong feelings for each other, have seen this and tried to run their own cafeteria. They elected a preparatory committee of five people, including Zhang Guanyi, to solicit members, look for locations, purchase utensils, and hire a kitchen. They completed the preparations in less than three days. There were 20 club members, and they first collected ten yuan per person for the first month's meal expenses, totaling two hundred yuan. By the second week, they began to serve their own meals. Each table had seven people, with a total of five dishes, including two meat dishes, two vegetarian dishes, and one soup. The rice was top-quality white rice. Although the vegetable dishes were not as fancy as those in restaurants, the quality was better. By the day before yesterday, the first month had ended, and the expenses were as follows:</p>
<p>Utensils (including start-up costs) 50 yuan</p>
<p>Firewood 5 yuan</p>
<p>Wages 5 yuan</p>
<p>Rice, 17 yuan 4 jiao per dan 68 yuan 9 jiao and 3 dan half</p>
<p>Seasoning 5 yuan</p>
<p>Rent 4 yuan</p>
<p>According to the expenses of the first month, it cost more than 9 yuan per person, and there was even morning porridge to eat. It was already considered a good deal. Moreover, starting from the second month, the 50 yuan for utensils could be saved. Calculated in this way, there would still be a surplus of 8 yuan per person. The price is low and the quality is good, why not? Moreover, gathering together day and night, the feelings will naturally be strong. Therefore, I record it and offer it to the university students at home and abroad (Gong Maoru).</p>

<p>Her Suffering</p>
<p>The voices were chaotic, as if arguing about something. I craned my neck to observe the truth and saw a skull placed among the crowd. Everyone's eyes were focused on it, staring intently.</p>
<p>Ah, that place was clearly a medical research institute. Then, I associated it with Shi, who has also entered the medical field this time, and perhaps is even in it.</p>
<p>Their voices aroused my memories of Shi's appearance and her liveliness. Her various things floated into my mind piece by piece.</p>
<p>She is a lively and sincere person. She shows a kind and amiable attitude to everyone.</p>
<p>Since she left School A, she has been living in that smooth and treacherous social life. But because of her inherent sincerity, she still lives her plain life and is not easily contaminated by the smooth and treacherous bad habits.</p>
<p>Alas, the smoothness and treachery of society is not limited to the scope of social undertakings. She did not fall into the social environment, but fell into the pit of emotions.</p>
<p>She and he are from the same hometown, and they had met before leaving school life, but they were not very familiar. Coincidentally, this season her residence was next to his. Then, as producers in the same academic field and as old acquaintances reunited, plus Shi's amiable attitude, they naturally became more familiar.</p>
<p>Coming and going, unknowingly, they became more and more familiar day by day. Every evening, they followed each other, chatting and playing tirelessly. This was unavoidable.</p>
<p>In their passionate situation, from the perspective of ordinary people, who would not say that they are at the stage of love? Although neither of them said, "It's just friendship and affection," but from the perspective of me, the observer, their actual performance was not without the weight of love. What's more, it was in that uncivilized Island B, which was an even clearer expression.</p>
<p>When the happy days are especially short. Soon it was their vacation, and also the time for other things. Anyone would have their heart beat for their impending separation.</p>
<p>Page 28</p>
<p>Alas, things cannot be predicted. When I saw her again a week after saying goodbye to her, I was so shocked that I didn't know what to say. The lively and plump her was now listless, as if she had just recovered from a long illness. She didn't even know how to answer my questions. I used all my energy to discern that she contained sorrow and hatred, so there must be something painful in it. Of course, I didn't dare to directly explore her so as not to evoke her sadness again. Later, I learned the source of her sorrow from her best friend.</p>
<p>She and he have now silently extinguished their past feelings. Examining the actions of both parties, it is not clear why they broke up. However, since the night he came to find her and they talked and talked in the room, he has not been seen since. She even wrote several letters to ask him, but he ignored them.</p>
<p>Since her feelings for him reached this point, she changed into a listless and sorrowful person. Not only that, but even the goals she had always wanted to achieve in her life became cold. Alas, this was unavoidable, because she had always been sincere and sincere to everyone, especially since he was someone she called a good friend. Now he suddenly treats her like a stranger. This is clearly a sign of contempt for her. Then, it can be inferred that it is even more so for ordinary people. Therefore, she lost her ambition and became discouraged for him, and was depressed all day long. Alas, it is truly pitiful, truly pitiful.</p>
<p>Fortunately, her best friend tried her best to explain to her, "Life is so cruel, vicious, and treacherous. It is full of traps everywhere. No one is reliable. It is still important to rely on yourself and believe in yourself. So don't lose heart, you should work hard, work hard to conquer all the environments and achieve your original goals."</p>
<p>Although she accepted her best friend's advice, she still harbors a belly of unspeakable pain. Because at this time, she still does not understand why he silently left her like this. (Shuang)</p>

New York futures sugar: December price was 1.49, a sharp rise of 7 points; next year March was 1.58, May was 1.64, September was 1.77, each also rising 5 points. Java futures and spot prices showed little change. The guild's raw white sugar price remained at 7 taels and 7 mace and 5 candareens, and finely ground white sugar at 7 taels and 8 mace. Although transactions were scarce, the market was still strong. No. 20 medium white sugar was 7 taels and 8 mace, and Taikoo B mark was 7 taels and 9 mace and 5 candareens, with few buyers. Nisshin Sugar Meihua YD mark was 7 taels 8 mace 2.5 candareens to 8 mace, YT mark was 7 taels 6 mace, YRO mark was 7 taels 3 mace, Kobe TM mark was 7 taels 4 mace, Dali N mark was 7 taels 8 mace, and J mark was 8 taels 0 mace 5 candareens.

Shanghai Renli Ice Factory's quoted price was 10 taels 8 mace, a decrease of 2 mace, and Qianzi was 10 taels 7 mace, also a decrease of 1 mace.

<h3>Seafood: New Dendrobium Nobile Supply Fails to Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Eighth Grade Ginseng Arrivals Cause Sluggish Sales</p>
<p>Dendrobium nobile merchandise in the market has long been sold out. The new goods are in extremely short supply due to poor harvests and very few sources. Although there are sporadic arrivals these days, there are at most a dozen boxes, and as few as three or five boxes. Moreover, business from buyers along the routes is gradually starting to move, so everything sells out upon arrival. The current market price is 225 taels for 30-branch top grade, 205 taels for 40-branch large size, 170-180 taels for 60-branch medium size, and 140 taels for small size. If sales to buyers continue to flourish, the market is expected to continue to rise. Eighth grade ginseng arrivals are more abundant, but sales are not widespread. Currently, only the Jiangsu and Zhejiang merchants are slightly interested in handling it, and there are no other sales channels, so the market is gradually declining. Yesterday's opening price for large-size high-quality goods was 103 taels, general goods 94-95 taels, and lower quality goods 78 taels 5 mace. Dealers have no intention of buying in, and the market situation is extremely dull, it is said.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Orchid Seeds Opening Price Rises Again</h3>
<p>Orchid seeds have recently become scarce and the local price has gradually risen, and the trend has tightened. According to yesterday's Taiyuan Wheel, only about thirty pieces arrived from Xiamen, and the samples already showed that the goods were brightly colored and the status was dry. The opening price was raised again compared to the previous one, and according to the Xiamen telegraph, it also rose by about one yuan. However, the market price is expected to be temporarily stable at this point, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Autumn Dried Cocoons Opening Price Increasingly Low</h3>
<p>More Than Eight Hundred, Reeling Discount... Price Only Eighty-Five Taels</p>
<p>Local silk factories have been greatly affected by the sluggish silk sales in Europe and the United States, and have been unable to maintain operations, and have successively announced shutdowns. The raw material factory for dried cocoons has stopped operations, and the cocoon market is increasingly lifeless. General hoarding households took the opportunity to hoard. Yesterday, more than 320 dan and more than 800 jin of Zhejiang Hangzhou autumn dried cocoons were entered by residual cocoon merchants. The reeling discount price was only 85 taels, and the net pan silk would cost 680-690 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Russian Firm Opens for Qimen Black Tea</h3>
<p>Qimen black tea, after the opening of the market and booming sales, has been sluggish for a long time. In the past few weeks, the Sino-Russian Cooperation Association has repeatedly invited tea shops to conduct negotiations, but most of them failed to set prices too low. Yesterday, the firm conducted another review of Qimen tea and continued negotiations. The market price has increased from more than thirty taels to more than forty taels, so the market has already purchased more than a thousand boxes. The export routes of Zhenmei green tea from British and French firms have also slightly improved, but the selling price is not good and the losses are huge, and people are still pessimistic, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Pinnacle of Melton Cloth</h3>
<p>After Melton cloth became popular among tailors, there was also a demand for large batches of military uniforms, and the market changed three times a day, and the selling price gradually increased. The stock at sea was almost completely depleted, and evergreen color was especially expensive. It is now heard that the original color is also popular, and the general market price has risen to 1.3 yuan. Yesterday, only Deji Dulanxiang remained unchanged, and all other miscellaneous brands soared. The ordinary Melton that sold for 1 tael and 3 or 4 mace last year has now increased to 1 tael and 5 or 6 mace at the opening. After large batches of custom-made clothes and military uniforms boomed, the price soared to 1 tael and 7 or 8 mace. Currently, buyers still have a strong need, and most are willing to pay 1 tael and 8 or 9 mace to 2 taels, but the goods are out of stock and cannot be found. Only Deji Dulanxiang still has a dozen boxes, selling for 2 taels 2 mace 5 candareens, and evergreen must be increased by 5 points.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Garden Galvanized Wire Opens with One Thousand Bundles</h3>
<p>Since the end of the war, the transaction of garden galvanized wire has been depressed by each help, and the standard has gradually declined due to the influx of sources from the East. Currently, the market only sells 4 taels and 4 mace, a decrease of a mace compared to the previous. Yesterday, the Tianjin Hankou helps suddenly had a need, so the whole city sold a total of more than one thousand bundles. After the market goods were sold, people were secretly encouraged, so the asking price returned to as high as 4 taels and 5 mace, while retail stores all valued it at 5 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>East White Iron Arrived Yesterday with Five Thousand Sheets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Huishan, Osaka, and Mitsubishi all had shipments of East white iron, but the number was only 5,000 sheets, so there was not much impact on the market. The current price is 9 mace 2.3 fen for 3 by 6 feet, and 1 tael 1 mace 3.4 fen for 3 by 7 feet. The most enthusiastic transactions are from the Jiangsu and inland helps, and the Ningbo and Hangzhou areas also have many spot orders, it is said.</p>
