<p>路透社十八日倫敦電分析下院關於顔料進口條例保正文之投票可知現有不欲於此時釀成閣潮之謀工黨議員三十人保守黨議員十餘人皆缺席其中大半聞皆同情於上院之修正文政府不容納上院挑戰之决議係内閣會議時所决定財政大臣史諾登臥病鄉間特扶病冒霧趕至倫敦參預閣議傳說辯論時政府表示寗願喪失全案而不願受上院之指揮但昨日投票之結果當可使政府今日抱較爲和緩之態度也</p>

<p>資方會議資方同業公會胡春生等於昨日下午三時召集全市典質新老兩同行於北海路開會員大會以便討論一切解决糾紛之問題及至下午四時所到會員僅有三十餘人仍以人數不足改爲談話會對於職工問題未有相當結果而同業公會主席傳佐衡已遠離上海前往無錫故資方對於此項風潮仍將處之以冷淡之態度也</p>
<p>責任問題日日社記者昨晤市黨部民訓會委員陶百川詢以黨部對於此事之態度及善後諸事據謂典質業職工會之組織在上海全市各職工會中比較健全而會員份子亦並不複雜本年七月間提出要求資方更改職工待遇條件之原因爲民國十六年勞資雙方所訂之條件在資方多數未曾實行即有實行者亦有不合於現在之生活等各種程度是以職工方面將以前所訂條件中之太高而資方未實行者重行修正希望資方再如條件之太低者亦加修訂適合職工現在之生活此項辦法曾經市黨部考核批准然後向資方提出其手續可謂完備而合法詎截至現在將近五月資方始終無誠意接洽談判旋經社會局呈請市政府依法調解或付仲裁市政府批示職工會應向法院依法起訴因職工會之組織即與店員組織爲同樣之性質故不適用勞工爭議處理法之調解或仲裁在職工方面事實上確有向法院起訴之困難而轉向市黨部請願黨部之意爲典質業與社會金融及平民生活等各方面有密切之關係且時值寒冬如果發生風潮則一般平民將贖取棉衣或典質金錢以維生計者均感受極大之影響是以將召集勞資雙方實行調解並在勞資爭議法之外用適當之方法使雙方互相討論修訂條約詎資方非特不出席談判并否認職工會之團體組織以爲政府已有取銷職工會之命令故認爲典質業職工會根本無提出向資方要求修改條件之資格殊不知政府方面最近已有職工會暫行維持之通令在典質業職工會是合法組織之團體目前並未取銷黨然有代表職工提出修改條件之資格并有簽訂契約之效力比如普通之任何機關存在一日即有一日之職權不能以爲將要取銷而未實行取銷之前就可不承認其職權之存在更不論政府已有職工會暫行維持之命令故典質業之資方不承認職工會有代表職工之職權及簽訂契約之效力此是根本錯誤而此次勞資糾紛之焦點所在亦即是資方否認職工會市黨部已决定訓令資方限期推派負責代表聽候黨部之調解否則風潮擴大一切責任將全歸典質業資方負擔云云又新聲社記者據社會局負責調解此次工潮之郭永熙表示此次黨政機關出爲調解無如資方藉詞推諉負責代表始終缺席以致激成罷工本局前晚已聞有罷工消息當於是晚訓令典質業同業公會立派負責代表出席聽候調解至昨日下午始得同業公會來電話謂本會俟十八日下午三時召集全體會員大會會議後即派負責代表出席聽候貴局調解云云故本局與市黨部民訓會擬再行設法召集勞資雙方調解以免此事曠日持久發生意外云</p>
<p>當局防範法租界捕房派偵察陳金標公共租界警務處派探員林臣甫前往職工會調查並對職工會稱希望貴會職工一切行動宜守秩序幸勿軌外行動免得與探捕發生誤會云云公安局一區總署亦派巡官前往通知職工會請求召會議前先行通告所屬各分所俾可派警保護</p>
<p>各方援助昨日實行罷工後閘北水電藥業等工會派李永祥方清鑑等前往職工會慰問並表示對於此次罷工深表同情極願以經濟及文字方面協力援助全市各職工會聯合會爲該典質業職工罷工特於昨晚開緊急會議討論援助事宜典質業職工會亦派盧慕琴曹品芳代表出席請求聲援</p>

<p>冰也</p>
<p>産生下届執行委員九人</p>
<p>通過研究室具體計劃書</p>
<p>復旦大學新聞學系在國内大學中算是最著名的一系它底地位及聲譽是一天一天地增高了這當然不是什麽虚名我們祗要看它所卓著的成績便能明白一斑的了不要説别的就是這新聞學系每届所畢業的同學在現社會上都得到重要的位置與及社會人士所推崇尤其是在國内報館裏需要對於新聞學有深刻研究的學者的時候在該系畢業的同學毋須説是要被器重的關於這些都是謝六逸主任與黃天鵬錢伯涵郭步陶請敎授的熱忱指導所致同時也因爲這系的同學較它系來得團結又富有辦事的眞精神即如掌管復旦通訊社的王德亮主編復旦五日刋的杜紹文都是犧牲自已爲整個復旦大學熱忱服務的生力軍這種種都是擺在我們眼前的事實誰也不能加以否認的槪括的說無論做什麽事有今日的成績就有過去的努力這爲一般人所能明瞭的</p>
<p>學期的考試在即新聞學系當然根據復旦本校的規定辦理學期的結束因爲這樣這系的總務杜紹文就於前日下午三時召集了一次全體大會亦旣是這學期新聞學系的末次大會到會者計有五十餘人這系的同學差不多全體出席的這足見這系同學的團結精神是如何的偉大值得外人所推崇的由主席報告了開會宗旨之後就爲謝主任訓辭謝主任熱忱的爲整個的系的努力是已得到校内外人士底定評尤其是在這一學期中更有黃天鵬敎授不憚煩勞的諄諄善誘不遺餘力的指導着所以這系的進展更爲迅速大有蒸蒸日上之勢至於謝主任的訓辭除了對本系同學們誠懇地勉勵之外並且報告以後改進的具體方案及添聘具有最高聲譽的名敎授其次是謝主任最希望於同學們能夠繼續過去團結的精神更進一步的努力下去這當然是極形中肯的話該系同學們應該深深地切記着的這亦足是謝主任對於同學們希望之熱忱了</p>
<p>黃天鵬敎授平素即異常的幽默這次他仍以極形和靄的態度對同學們表示熱烈的愛護黃敎授這次所要說的話都已懇託謝主任代爲宣佈了所以黃敎授祗是浮現着慈愛的微笑不發一言　　這次該系畢業生計有六人（一）王德亮（二）沈煥宗（三）陶松琴（四）陳鵬（五）黃紹輾（六）持建成這六位同學謝主任已再三向同學們介紹過係本系最有力的生力軍但是這次驀然離校在新聞學系本身上說的確是有似失去了中流的抵柱這很使我們慨然的不過還有該系的中堅份子子杜紹文等在着尙可補足這種最大的遺陷這次的畢業生除了陶楊兩君東渡準備繼續研究高深的新聞學外其餘在國内各大著名的報館裏均已接妥重要的位置這就是該系所造成有力的人才的表象據說上次畢業的同學中有兩位女生一位是項富春女士已留日一位是張吾素女士將赴法她倆將來回國時對於國内新聞學界當有偉大的貢獻這是在我們預料之中的事也可以說是國内新聞學界唯一的好消息</p>
<p>王德亮杜紹文二君對於該系是最努力的中堅份子這次擬定了（復旦新聞學系研究室初步計劃書）一文長約萬言其中擬有具體方案更可作其它大學辦理新聞學系研究室者之參考因爲篇幅的關係不能把它詳細的介紹出來這却是一椿憾事在（緣起）裏寫有同學們應守的信條是很可注意的大意是這樣的（從今以後脚踏實地實事求是的到研究室裏研究新聞學研究室是研究新聞學之府庫研究室是新聞學之源泉研究室是新聞學之魂靈研究室是研究新聞學最好之良好研究室是新聞學最好之導師研究室是研究新聞之修養所研究室是研究新聞學之試騐塲到研究裏去擁護我們的研究室··）眞的新聞學系的同學都應守着這信條這研究室之能夠成功實是值得讚美的關於研究室的基本指導者已特請黃天鵬敎授擔任謝主任母須說是熱忱的促進者</p>
<p>其次組織留佼委員會專責辦理研究室事當時即推定楊杏陳藻華湯增敭等十人組織之並由謝主任指定湯增敭負責召集會議由此新聞學系系會的工作可以不斷的進行這是它系所不能辦到的</p>
<p>最後選舉下届之執行委員九人其結果爲（一）杜紹文（二）徐叔明（三）曾貫之（四）黃奂若（五）湯增敭（六）郭貞一（七）王伊蔚（八）陳藻華（九）魏藴軒後補者爲暢壽昌等五人郭王兩女士善交際長口才對於新聞學極有研究亦爲該系之中堅份子王女士平日更爲它系女同學們所注意這次均被選爲執行委員對於辦事之成績定有可觀這當爲同學們所預料的</p>
<p>歡送畢業同學留影後即由主席宣告散會所備之精美茶點這時亦大啖一空了</p>
<p>青年園地稿例</p>
<p>（一）文字以關於青年問題之討論國内國外學或學生之消息隨筆學校生活之描寫筆隨等爲範圍體裁不拘</p>
<p>（二）圖畫以關於青年問題者爲限</p>
<p>（三）照片以青年生活（如運動旅行遊覽演劇演講集會展覽各種比賽等）學校新聞及青年運動等爲合格不論個人團體均所歡迎</p>

<p>評兩個繪畫展覽會崙西</p>
<p>上海藝專與上海美專</p>
<p>上海美專展覽會開後繼續而起的上海藝專的展覽會也開了菜市路口江灣路上一時增添了不少的游覽人足跡剌骨的寒風裏許多青年男女們在那裏丨展覽會塲丨都來感懷了藝術的精靈　量吸取了人生的眞義</p>
<p>個人是非常底喜悅美丨術繪畫在孩童時代的我早已萌芽了美術的（信心）</p>
<p>繪畫展覽會是我生平最喜悅去參觀的事在會塲裏的畫幅面前可以洗去一切的憂慮掉换的加上給人一些深趣的美感使人生出愉快消滅你失望的苦悶補助你奮鬥的勇力尤其是一幅美好的作品看了後給人的印象是深深刻在你的心靈上彷彿一個甜密的幻夢蕩浮在醒來的腦際瞹昧般追憶</p>
<p>我在這兩個展覽會的會塲徘徊了幾天在那時的我是沉醉在裏面鑒賞雖然有一些不好的印象給我但美好的到現在還留在我的心上現在坐下來寫了這篇文字說來很是不客氣的（客氣的批評）是虚僞相信研究藝術的人是决不喜歡接受别人的虚僞批評吧</p>
<p>這次兩個繪畫展覽會的成績之優劣比較則上海美專要比上海藝專爲遜色這是我很不客氣的說爲什麽呢上海美專全會塲的繪畫大部分是千篇一律的灰色很缺少個性創作的活躍雖然是有少數的幾幅現出新奇的表現上海藝專的作品在幼稚的青年的作品裏當然夾雜了一些不成熟的東西在裏面然而個性（創作）的光鋩卻在壁間的畫幅上互相輝眏有幾幅好的油畫那很可以壓倒上海美專這次展覽會全塲上的成績在陳列會場的作品計量比較則上海美專多而上海藝專少量多質遜不如量少質精爲佳深望以後别校繪畫展覽之愼重於選取以免徒勞看者之精神浪費寳貴時間</p>
<p>這次兩個展覽會會塲秩序之精神上海美專在外表頗爲莊嚴場内則無數畫幅下之名號標籤是很少寫上作者姓名及畫題使觀者頗感苦悶上海藝專對於塲内陳列秩序的精神較爲整齊因爲這緣故我對於上海美專的批評不能詳細寫出只好作一個槪念的批評罷了</p>
<p>上海美專的油畫人體我見了四張比較完美一點的要數混和陳列室的那幾幅兩幅裸女寫生畫兩幅男子的搆圖畫一幅裸女的色調在作者是具了陰鬱的情緒來表現全幅充滿了寒冷凄慘的灰色筆觸是胆大有力可算是一幅比較完美的作品另外一幅裸女畫的色調含有柔麗的情調頗能表現女性的美感脫去灰暗的舊衣赤裸祼的現露出鮮耀活潑的顔與前一幅陰鬱的相襯則互映成趣</p>
<p>水彩畫陳列雖多在踴躋的壁上很難找出幾幅生動的色調來風景有幾幅比較還清爽明快至於靜動是没有一幅完美的作品胆大的因修養的功夫淺往往現出生硬暴糙作色較好的却胆小現出呆板無味</p>
<p>談完了學生出品轉到在敎授方面吧在敎授陳列室的畫國畫倒還多西畫僅十多幅掛在陰暗的屋角壁上全室的比較則要推舉那幅男子人面的（肖像）畫第一用筆生動大方色調柔和深厚很能把這男相的英武神氣表現得十足有味此畫不知是誰作的在畫幅上没有單名旁邊又没有標籤故未寫出作者姓名計油畫人體在那地共有四幅較好的只有這一幅二幅人體木炭畫與學生所作好得相差不遠全塲最糟的要推中國裱的那幾幅水彩畫全是風景在每幅充滿了一樣的灰暗平板那幾幅風景畫遠近色是一樣的没有透視在氣候的表現很像似忘懷了樣給人的印象儘是一幅平凡的景色構圖也太平凡讀之使人失望</p>
<p>國畫我没有專心研究過所以這次的國畫成績我是不敢來談半句的批評　　上海藝專的成績在會塲裏詳細記下了各作者名字與畫題本來别人早已在報上批評他們大半是槪括的批評現在我作個有統系分析的批評當然與别人不同不過是經過我一番的選擇在没有十分有深厚趣味的作品我是没有詳細逐一的記上只把每間展覽室的好的作品記上作一個很簡短的批評</p>
<p>第一陳列室　宗旺吾之油畫（靜物）色調單純老練具有深趣表現物體之空氣及各個物體質性尤佳非申君之油畫（江灣路上）全幅色調幽美搆圖均稱惜路之地色過暗與天空色衝突黃岩梧君之油畫（秋的早晨）早霧之氣頗能現露於畫面地景綠色過多有失全幅氣候之統一梁琛君之油畫搆圖取景很有精彩只是空氣的表現不足</p>
<p>第二陸列室　杜十七君之油畫（江灣路上）作色取景有獨到處筆筆大方不苟頗有大家作風秋人君之粉畫一晨）取材搆圖作色均佳利用全幅的綠色的調子輕淡描上幾筆頗能表現出濛濛的霧意兩個修理電車道溝的工人屈着背在埋頭作工後面襯一馬拉之垃圾車更能現出工人之勞苦與繁重幾條灣屈的電車道溝路綫很適當的羅列在畫幅上他的油畫（自畫像）色調穆肅幽美含有壯嚴的氣韻另有一幅油畫的（殿）色調很能畫出光綫的陰暗搆圖雄偉幽深動人情緒杜十七君之油畫（裸女）色柔和富噯昧的肉感性筆調流利清爽可稱爲全塲代表佳作並駕過乎上海美專全塲之人體油畫李仲生水彩（自畫像）色調潤澤用筆活潑有生趣</p>
<p>第三陳列室　秋人君之圖案畫一黃浦印象）表現深厚搆圖嚴密於黃浦灘之自由神之和平假局面作刻骨諷剌的評判描寫自由神之後面佈滿了外洋各帝國主義的政治浸略工具飛機戰艦在自由神的座下深深底埋藏了兩粒臣大的砲彈象徴帝國主義侵略中國之深入内地驚心駭目稍具有熱情於中國之生存青年我想對此幅畫應該謹敬（三思）以激起民族思想劉家讓君之油畫（色的展覽）全幅色調之陪襯頗有變化李仲生君之油畫（自畫像）筆調頗能表現肌肉之趣味馮潮君之（油畫）（裸女）筆調老練成熟襯色諧和有變化</p>
<p>第四陳列室　兆甲君之油畫風景（鳥視）具有搆圖派之風色調陪襯新奇用筆及搆别開生面均有創作之個性流露油畫（炎日下）亦佳惜全幅氣候欠妥雖有極强了日光明暗在全幅色調卻無熱感之情調存在空氣不能十分表出油畫（上海之村）用色純熟幽靜同鳥視一幅相較則不同取自然之景色姊化於心爐再鑄於畫面上乃能成此佳作陳煥君之油畫（倒影）搆圖佳全幅色欠變化筆調胆大而有力馮潮君之油畫（肖像）</p>
<p>色調沉靜表現肌肉之味及神氣之生動頗足</p>
<p>第五陳列室　杜十七君之油畫（裸女）色調幽美具有少女豐富的肌肉的美感動人襯色尤佳秋人君之油畫（風景）全幅很能露出沉悶憂穆的空氣水影色單純清快表現水之生動不過天空氣色過暗與遠景屋頂色相混周繼善君之油畫（冬日）色調過於單純缺乏變化</p>
<p>第六陳列室　這間展覽室是陳列上</p>
<p>海藝專的敎授們的作品我覺得全塲在（題材）上比較有意義而值得我們讚美的要推朱應鵬先生三幅油畫搆圖新奇取材於人事的想象（地母）一幅嚴肅動人深思（后羿射日）頗能表現作者情緒之緊張描寫）夜叉（一幅髮之紅色太明若稍暗感改用其他的寒色則更諧和美好從陰森地現示出夜之恐怖朱應鵬先生的用色喜用深暗之冷色與明耀之紅橙色見（后羿射日）及（地母）兩幅之色調可知其個性的傾向</p>
<p>其次陳抱一先生的作品油畫（靜物與風景色調老調單純而有樸實風味筆力雄厚瀟洒活躍一Ｋ女士）一幅作色雖佳因面部畫得太大我覺得女性的肖像畫應較小才能表現出女性們的幽</p>

<p>美</p>
<p>貽德先先的畫僅僅只有兩幅靜物的油畫（瓶）的一幅較）樂器（一幅爲好用筆大方有勁在色調的研究傾向於誠樸的作風表現</p>
<p>關紫蘭女士作品油畫靜物（葡萄）一幅較佳頗能表出果實的生命及棹布間的空氣浮蕩王道源先生的畫亦佳　　陳之佛先生的圖案畫設色搆圖全獨具心才别開生面含東方藝術風味頗深不與西方圖案相同無市儈匠人之俗氣裝飾圖案尤佳</p>
<p>在寫完了的末頁我連有幾句話來供獻給大家尤其是敎授們上海美專的成績這次爲什麽這樣使人失望不能全說是美專的同學不長進是他們受了盲目的催眠自已埋没了自已創作（個性）依賴于先生之敎導作摹仿的奴隸敎授主張要用灰色把全校的同學的色調通通一律灰化我們走進會塲去看自然而然的會生出厭倦的博緒來這是因爲灰色過多給人看了沉悶的緣故</p>
<p>灰色在畫幅上有時相當也能顯示出牠的憂鬱的美來用灰色調子來作畫要是用得恰當亦可以得很好的結果灰色在畫幅上之位值有如醋之在於烹調上一樣但敎學生來專用灰色有戕害青創作的個性以後希望他們把這種敎學法改正過來</p>
<p>上海藝專開辦的歷史很少而能在成績上駕過於老牌子的上海美專緣因是由一個主張個性的創作而獲得前進的開展一個主張個性理說所以便反而退轉落伍我想誰也是不能否認的吧以後希望上海藝專的同學更爲努力進展將來在中國的繪畫上造成良好的景象至於上海美專的同學我誠懇的希望他們跳出灰色的迷圈各人來創作各人個性表現的藝術</p>

<p>帝國美術院會員和田英作氏的（早春）壞極了一幅富士山的春景虧他能畫得像柯羅版風景照片那那妍麗精細只可惜旁邊少貼了一條紙條標明（歡迎婦女參觀）或（兒童特前觀覽席）等字樣</p>
<p>小林萬吾氏的（輕羅）是描寫一個朝鮮婦人的立像隨俗的技巧同和田氏的（早春）一樣的無價值</p>
<p>一幅畫着許多美麗的富於肉感的日本裸體婦人就浴於峽谷温泉的情景的（峽谷温泉）的作者丨中澤弘光氏丨就是今年帝展第二部西洋畫主任的榮膺者就日本的官學派說來他的技藝并不能算是怎樣超脫的一個不過辦起事來比他們稍能活動些罷了他是喜歡畫風俗畫風景畫和裸體畫的多少帶有點浪漫派的臭味（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Plans to Suppress the Communist Bandits <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province Establishes the "Three Clearances and Suppression Council"</p>
<p>Nanchang - Following Chiang's instructions during his time in Jiangxi, the province has established the "Three Clearances and Suppression Council." 1. The Le'an District includes the counties of Yihuang, Chongren, Linchuan, Nanfeng, Guangchang, etc. 2. The Yongfeng District includes the counties of Xiajiang, Xingan, Qingjiang, Fengcheng, etc. 3. The Ji'an District includes the counties of Jishui, Taihe, Anfu, etc. Tan Daoyuan, Zhang Huizan, and Luo Lin are appointed as chairmen of the committees respectively. The Ninth Route Army Headquarters, led by Lu, is stationed in Ji'an; the Sixth Route Army Headquarters, led by Zhu, is stationed in Linchuan; the Nineteenth Route Army Headquarters, led by Cai, is stationed in Yongxin. The communist bandits in southwestern Jiangxi and the Donggu bandit nest are in a state of heavy encirclement. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou - Chiang cables Luo Lin, ordering him to reorganize his troops into a Class B division by the end of the year. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou - Military news: Huarong is completely pacified. The bandits have fled to Songzi and Shishou. The forward headquarters has dispatched troops to intercept and suppress them. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou - Military news: Zhang Huizan returned to Yongfeng on the 18th to prevent his troops from joining other armies in suppressing the remaining bandits in Donggu. He is ordered to recapture the area before the 20th. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou - Xiao Zhichu wires that the bandits north of Hanhuang'an counterattacked Hekou on the evening of the 16th but were defeated by the Xin Brigade. On the 17th, they were pursued from Qiliping and have now advanced and are stationed in Longtan. Furthermore, the captain of the "Yongsheng" warship cabled that there are no traces of bandits in Huangsangkou. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou - The bandit army of Honghu, led by the puppet army commander Wang Yang, gathered 4,000 bandits in Bicheng and invaded Guojiahe and Songxinchang. They were fiercely attacked by the New Third Brigade, resulting in the death of 600 bandits, including one secretary-general and one regimental commander. The bandits fled in disarray to southern Qin. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha - He Long fled from Gong'an and captured Songzi. Li Jue led his troops towards Gongsong on the 18th to suppress them and killed the bandit leader Gou Jianzhang from Lixian.

If there are any further consultations, they will be notified by phone at any time. The military aftermath is being handled by Xu, and there are no more problems.

Yang Aiyuan arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 18th and is staying at the Huizhong Hotel. He is scheduled to meet with Zhang along with Fu Zuoyi on the evening of the 19th. As for the overall plan, Zhang will be able to announce it only after returning to Pan.

<p>Tianjin - Pang Bingxun told reporters that he visited Zhang on the evening of the 18th to report on the situation of the Northwest Army in southern Shanxi. As for seeking instructions on the aftermath plan, it seems there will be two or three days of negotiations, but everything will be at Zhang's command. Feng Yuxiang left Taiyuan the day after Yan left, accompanied by a very small entourage. His current whereabouts are unknown. Feng's wife, Li Dequan, recently gave birth in Tianjin and did not accompany Feng. Rumors that Feng is going to Russia are absolutely untrue because during the Wuhan government era, Feng was strongly opposed to Soviet Russia's attempt to communize China, so his relationship with Borodin was very bad.

<p>Beiping - Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun passed through Beiping yesterday, staying for only one hour before transferring to a train to Tianjin. Fu Zuoyi arrived in Tianjin on the evening train. Yang Aiyuan, Sun Dianying, and others did not arrive yesterday. Fu is already on his way. Pang said when passing through Beiping that his army currently has over 13,000 troops stationed in Qin County and Wuxiang, with a monthly salary of 240,000 yuan allocated by the Shanxi headquarters. Song's troops, combined with the remnants of Sun Liangcheng's troops, number over 30,000 and are stationed in Yuncheng, Pinglu, Quwo, and Zezhou. Sun Dianying's troops number nearly 30,000, and Gao Guizi's troops number 3,000. It is reported that after Song and Pang arrive in Tianjin, they will first meet with Shang and Xu before meeting with Zhang on the 18th. The aftermath plan that Zhang previously discussed with Shang and Xu was originally intended to be resolved as a whole. However, because the Shanxi side's internal opinions could not be unified, Shang and Xu seemed unable to fully represent them, so Fu, Song, Pang, Sun, and others were summoned separately for face-to-face talks, resulting in a further extension of the departure date. General observations suggest that the final outcome will be a change from a holistic solution to separate solutions, with each unit directly controlled by Zhang. (Eighteenth-day dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e2">A Global Trend of Pessimism <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>After enduring hardship, people are often prone to pessimistic thoughts. Since the European war, the people of affected countries have been thinking of striving to achieve something in order to overcome their difficulties. Therefore, although they were in a difficult situation at that time, there was no sign of pessimism. However, in recent years, excessive struggles in industry and commerce have led to oversupply of products and a decline in commerce. They want to struggle but have nothing to struggle for, and they want to provide relief but have no way to provide it. As a result, everyone thinks that a great disaster is coming and cannot be resisted by human power. The mind of striving forward has changed to a decaying phenomenon, and the trend of pessimism is revealed everywhere.</p>
<p>One of the predictions of the world's prophet, Madame Danmer Flaya, for next year is that there will be no happiness in the international situation, but all disasters. The closure of banks in various parts of the United States has continued. Secondly, because people's hearts are trapped in pessimism, faith is decreasing and panic is increasing. Revolutions in European and American countries are heard every day. Thirdly, everyone is suffering from the current predicament and has no way to remedy it. They think of changing the strings and reorganizing, and do not hesitate to seek survival in destruction again and again. These three points are mostly due to pessimistic psychology, and although this pessimistic psychology is also forced by facts, once the psychology is involved in pessimism, the facts will fall into a more difficult situation. This is unavoidable.</p>

<p>Foreign Urgent Dispatches</p>
<h3 id="e24">Vladivostok Korean Bank Closed <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Due to illegal foreign exchange trading, the Japanese fishing industry is greatly affected.</p>
<p>Serious negotiations are expected.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, eighteenth dispatch: Soviet authorities yesterday afternoon ordered the closure of the Korean Bank in Vladivostok. This was confirmed by an official telegram. Since this summer, Russian officials have frequently investigated the bank's books, alleging illegal foreign exchange trading. The Japanese government has repeatedly protested to the Soviet government. The closure of the bank will most affect the Japanese fishing industry, as the annual compensation payment will jump from 4 million Japanese yen to 10 million Japanese yen, according to the exchange rate set by the Soviet Union, making it difficult to continue operations.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Tokyo, eighteenth dispatch: Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara, Finance Minister Inoue, and the president of the Korean Bank decided to formally close the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank after consultations. However, the order is temporarily withheld pending further developments in the case.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance, Tokyo, eighteenth dispatch: Regarding the issue of the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank being ordered to cease operations by labor and peasant officials, a powerful trader with Russia told a reporter that the tyrannical measures taken by the Russians this time were expected by Japanese officials and civilians. Whenever major diplomatic cases are to be negotiated, a preliminary act like this is always performed.</p>
<p>The closure of the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank will have a very significant adverse impact on Japanese trade and finance. According to investigations by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the state of Japanese-Russian trade is as follows: From January to October of this year, exports to Russia in European Russia were 772 (unit: thousands of yen), imports were 2266; exports to Russia in Asian Russia were 34660, imports were 26793.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance, Tokyo, on the same day: Regarding the issue of the Vladivostok branch of the Korean Bank being closed, authorities at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this tyrannical action by labor and peasant officials clearly aims to create significant obstacles in Japanese-Russian economic relations and has lodged a serious protest with the Moscow government. Negotiations are currently underway. The labor and peasant side claims that the branch engaged in ruble speculation and secret trading, violating Russian domestic regulations, and refuses to admit any wrongdoing. Our government has ordered the branch to collect powerful materials to refute Russia's claims and has instructed all relevant parties to carefully discuss and then take appropriate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Guatemala</p>
<p>Military Government Established</p>
<p>General Orellana Appointed Leader</p>
<p>Three Government Changes in Six Years</p>
<p>President Chacón Deposed and Flees</p>
<p>National News Agency, Guatemala City, seventeenth dispatch: After fierce fighting among various parties for about a week, Guatemala is now ruled by a military government. The leader of the new government is General Orellana. This is the third change of government in Guatemala in six years. Tonight, the censorship order has been lifted. It is known abroad that the revolution in Guatemala on Friday of last week overthrew the Liberal Party government and ousted President Chacón. Everything was commanded by Vice President Palma. Palma assumed the position of interim president until General Orellana launched a counter-revolution on Tuesday night, engaging in several fierce battles with Palma's troops and ultimately winning. Thus, the life of the interim government also ended. When President Chacón was ousted, he announced that he had resigned due to illness. Unexpectedly, General Palma organized an interim government to replace him. Before Palma's seat had warmed, General Orellana suddenly rose up in resistance like lightning, and was ultimately subdued. Guatemala is now completely controlled by the military government. The country is as peaceful as usual tonight. The military government claims that it will hold new elections when order is fully restored. The members of the military government's cabinet are all appointed by General Orellana. President Chacón's term was supposed to expire on March 15, 1933. It is also reported that the former Minister of the Army was killed during the revolutionary attack.</p>

<p>Government Declares Uprising Will Soon Be Quelled</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, seventeenth dispatch: The New York Times reports a dispatch from Gibraltar that several units of the Spanish Navy have joined the revolutionary army. It is reported that the fleets in Cadiz and Valencia have raised red flags. News from Pamplona indicates that several airplanes have scattered leaflets in Catalonia, urging workers to strike and warning the people to strictly maintain order to avoid government retaliation. All work in Barcelona has ceased, but the area is still peaceful. Troops guard the key points of the city. Currently, a general strike has been declared in a total of eight provinces in Spain.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, seventeenth dispatch: Today, three more Spanish aviation officers who support the revolutionary army landed in Lisbon with their planes. The Portuguese Ministry of the Army declared that they would be treated as political prisoners. Franco and the planes brought by other revolutionary officers are allowed to temporarily park in the Portuguese Army Aviation Field. Recently, Franco told visitors that if this revolution fails, he will reside in France, Belgium, or Germany to wait for the opportunity. The failure of the uprising at the aviation field near Madrid was due to the temporary panic of several officers involved. It is reported that they surrendered with their troops as soon as the government forces arrived.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, seventeenth dispatch: Currently, telegraph, telephone, and railway communications have been repaired. It is easier to obtain accurate information about the situation in various parts of the country.

The military commander of the Zaragoza region has ordered the city's drivers to be arrested if they do not resume work within 24 hours. As for the capital, General Berenguer's sick leave is indeed due to a cold and fever, and there are no political reasons. The city is still peaceful. Security teams and machine gun teams patrol the streets. Today, royalists marched in front of the Royal Palace to demonstrate. The government claims that the rebel army in Alicante has been defeated, and order has been restored in Santander, Valencia, and Zaragoza. However, postal and telegraph censorship is still strict.</p>

<p>Seeking to Restore National Credit</p>
<p>County Councilor Hirose Assassinated and Killed</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, eighteenth dispatch: In order to renew the public's trust, the government intends to add new policies, which will be announced at an appropriate time during the deliberations with the party congress and the administrative and financial system investigation committee. The new policies currently decided to be announced are as follows: (1) Thorough financial consolidation (2) Fundamental reform of administrative, financial, tax and other systems (3) Army reorganization and reduction (4) Amendment of the pension law (5) Concretization of social policies</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Oita, eighteenth dispatch: Oita Prefectural Assembly member Hirose Hikotaro of the Minseito faction was assassinated and killed yesterday afternoon in the rest room of the assembly hall on the final day of the prefectural assembly. Hirose had recently defected from the Seiyukai to join the Minseito, causing a reversal in the prefectural assembly's alignment, which seems to have been the cause of this misfortune due to resentment from the Seiyukai.</p>
<h3 id="e29">British Expiring Laws Continuation Bill <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Amendment Returned to the Upper House</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, seventeenth dispatch: Secretary of Commerce Graham stated in the House of Commons today that the government requests the House of Commons not to approve the amendment to the Expiring Laws Continuation Bill passed by the House of Lords on December 15. The House of Lords amendment seeks to extend the Paint Import Regulations until the end of 1931, rather than expiring on January 15 as the government proposed. The House of Commons subsequently decided not to approve the House of Lords amendment by a vote of 244 to 238. Therefore, the bill is now returned to the House of Lords. It is expected that the House of Lords will consider it tomorrow. Liberal Party members voted on both sides, and left-wing Labour Party members did not vote, so the government's majority was only a few votes. Given this situation, the House of Lords may not want to abandon its amendment. If the House of Lords does not abandon it and the House of Commons still does not approve it, the Expiring Laws Continuation Bill will naturally be completely lost, and the Rent Restriction Act will also be lost.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, eighteenth dispatch: An analysis of the vote in the House of Commons regarding the Paint Import Regulations reveals a scheme to avoid a cabinet crisis at this time. Thirty Labour Party members and more than ten Conservative Party members were absent, most of whom are said to sympathize with the House of Lords amendment. The government's decision not to accept the challenge from the House of Lords was decided at a cabinet meeting. Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, who was ill in the countryside, braved the mist to travel to London to participate in the cabinet meeting. It is rumored that during the debate, the government indicated that it would rather lose the entire bill than be directed by the House of Lords. However, the result of yesterday's vote may cause the government to adopt a more conciliatory attitude today.</p>

<h3 id="e32">He Chengjun and Others Return to Hankou from Lushan <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang Will Come to Hankou in Three or Four Days</p>
<p>The Pacification of Hunan and Hubei Will Still Be Under the Control of the Wuhan Headquarters</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, the head of the Wuhan Headquarters, previously took the Chu Tai warship to Xunyang to welcome Commander-in-Chief Chiang, and then accompanied Commander-in-Chief Chiang to Nanchang to discuss bandit suppression with the generals of Jiangxi Province. On the 11th of this month, Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Lushan for rest, and He also went with him. The generals here were summoned to the mountain one after another. Until last night, the military authorities here received a telegram from Jiujiang stating that Commander-in-Chief Chiang would come to Hankou within a few days, and Director He led the generals back first. After informing He and others of the itinerary, key figures from various agencies gathered at the No. 5 Wharf on the Jiang'an on the morning of the 17th to welcome them. They included Wu Xingya, Zhang Guanshi, Hua Jueming, Zhao Guantao, Hao Mengling, Yue Weijun, Chen Guangzu, Xu Langxi, and Ye Peng, Zhu Chuanjing, etc., totaling about a hundred people. The garrison command sent the 2nd Special Battalion of the 77th Regiment of the 13th Division and the Military Police Battalion of the 48th Division to take charge of security. At 2:10 PM, the Taikoo Company's Wusong ship arrived at the port and docked. He Chengjun was the first to disembark and greeted the welcoming crowd. Then, He Jian, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Liu Mao'en, Xiao Zhichu, Fan Xiji, Liu Wendao, and Zhou Xin, among others, disembarked one after another and transferred to the headquarters of the Third Army Corps and their respective private residences. After He and others arrived in Hankou, I visited them separately and had the opportunity to meet them and discuss the following:</p>
<p>He Chengjun stated: I went to Xunyang this time to welcome the Commander-in-Chief and accompanied him to Nanchang to inspect the bandit situation in the province. After staying for a few days, I returned to Xunyang. I believe the Commander-in-Chief is touring Lushan. At the moment, the Commander-in-Chief has arranged the bandit suppression plan in Jiangxi and plans to come to Hankou within a few days. The exact date has not yet been determined, and whether he will go to Hunan is even more uncertain. As for the reports that he will go to Xi'an within the year, that is also not certain. The Commander-in-Chief summoned the generals in Nanchang and Lushan to inquire about the bandit situation in various places and ordered the troops to implement the plan. As for the generals of Hubei Province, such as the army division commanders Xu Xiaoxiao and Liu Mao'en, etc., going to Xunyang was nothing more than reporting everything to the Commander-in-Chief after the suppression of the rebellion. In the future, the bandit suppression plan in the three provinces will still be a three-month period for elimination, and all lost areas must be recovered before January 15, otherwise they will be punished for disobedience. In the future, the pacification of the two provinces of Hunan and Hubei will still be under the control of the Wuhan Headquarters. The generals who came to Hubei will have another discussion after the Commander-in-Chief arrives in Hankou and then return to their respective defenses.</p>
<p>He Jian stated: This time, I was summoned to Xunyang and met the Commander-in-Chief several times in Guling. I have reported in detail on the bandit disaster in Hunan Province and the implementation of the suppression. In the future, the bandit suppression in the two provinces of Hunan and Hubei will be carried out separately according to a plan drawn up by Director He. When I will return to Hunan must be decided tomorrow, because military and political affairs in Hunan Province are complicated and require personal management. I may not be able to wait for the Commander-in-Chief to come to Hankou and plan to return to defense immediately.</p>
<p>Liu Wendao stated: This time, I accompanied Chairman He Yunqiao to Lushan to meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang to report on the bandit suppression in Hunan Province. I reported on the municipal situation in Hankou. After Chairman Chiang also served as the President of the Executive Yuan, I had to go to ask for instructions on the municipal situation in Hankou and welcome him to Hubei. He has no other tasks, and he has not heard about the bandit suppression matters. Commander-in-Chief Chiang is currently staying in Lushan for a short time and will be able to come to Hankou within three or four days.</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan stated: I went to Guling this time to meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang to report on the bandit suppression situation. I was deeply praised and received extremely detailed instructions. After Commander-in-Chief Chiang comes to Hankou, I will go to western Hubei to follow the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Director He to eliminate the bandits and communists in western Hubei and attack the Honghu bandit den. The 44th Division is temporarily stationed in eastern Hubei and will still join the bandit suppression in western Hubei in the future. The reason why it has not yet departed is that the troops taking over the defense have not yet arrived in eastern Hubei. If the troops taking over the defense arrive, Xiao's division will immediately depart to strengthen the military force in western Hubei.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhichu stated: I have been participating in the suppression of the rebellion in the front for several months and have not been able to pay my respects to the Commander-in-Chief. Later, after the war ended, I was transferred to Hubei to suppress the bandits, but I was too busy with deployments to take the time to go to the capital. I heard that the Commander-in-Chief was about to come to Hubei and was ordered to report to Hankou on the 12th to listen to instructions. After arriving in Hankou, I received a telegram summoning me to Xunyang, so I took a boat with Commanders Xia and Xu on the evening of the 14th. After arriving in Xunyang, I went to Guling and reported to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He on the bandit suppression situation in eastern Hubei and the recovery of Huang'an. I was praised by Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Director He. Now, my division has been ordered to temporarily stay in eastern Hubei to continue suppressing the bandits and communists.

The military headquarters is now located in the old inspection institute on Dongmen Street. I visited Wang at the Huayuan Hotel. According to the conversation, he left Zhengzhou the night before and met with Liu Zhi in Bian yesterday to discuss military affairs before proceeding to Xuzhou this morning. The defense area of ​​the 7th Division is between Tengxian and Fuliji, and the garrison troops along the Jinpu Railway are under his command. As for the organization of the Garrison Command, it is planned to go to Beijing to ask for instructions on how to handle it after Chairman Chiang returns to Beijing. Wang also talked about the battle experience of the troops and finally said that the 7th Division plans to move out most of its troops to protect the road, while the directly subordinate troops will be stationed in Xuzhou. The defense of Xuzhou will still be the responsibility of the 52nd Division, so that they can become familiar with the situation. I also inquired about the recent situation in the northwest. Wang said that the Central Army originally had four pursuit teams, namely Gu Zhutong, Wang Jinyu, Liu Mao'en, and Wang Jun. At the moment, only Gu's troops have entered Shaanxi to handle the aftermath. The Second Division is stationed at Tongguan, the Third Division is stationed at Huayin, and the Tenth Division, Yang Shengzhi's troops, has also entered Lingbao. Wang Jinyu's troops have been transferred to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists, and Liu Mao'en's troops have crossed the river to take over the defense of Luoyang in Hebei. The current 9th Division of Jiang Dingwen's troops is stationed there, and the current situation is very stable. It is reported that the directly subordinate troops of Wang's 7th Division, the artillery battalion of Yang Fang, the special service battalion of Xiao Jiliang, the cavalry company of Li Quan, and the engineer battalion, etc., arrived in Xuzhou by three trains today (17th).

<p>Opinions on the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax</p>
<p>Since the central government has determined that the cutting of likin will be implemented on New Year's Day of the 20th year, the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax is actively preparing for collection. Today (18th), a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Department of Finance and the Business Tax Preparatory Committee to express its opinions: Since the central government has determined the date for cutting likin, the government has changed the original plan to prepare for the business tax, slowed down the collection of the original business registration fee, and convened the Business Tax Preparatory Committee to discuss in detail in order to implement it after cutting the likin and then begin to handle the business tax. It can be seen that the government's intention is to adapt to the times and be cautious. Now, Minister of Finance Song's telegram has been received, which will be implemented on January 1st of the 20th year, cutting likin and taxes similar to likin. After the likin tax is cut, the business tax will be the compensating income of the provincial treasury. No matter how difficult the merchants and people are, they should obey without obstruction. However, the Ministry of Finance has regulations on the outline of business tax measures, and the date for cutting likin has been determined. The previous Jiangsu Province's plan to compensate for cutting likin is a thing of the past and not a problem. In the future, when Jiangsu Province handles the business tax, all tax rates and everything else should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance's outline of business tax measures. Otherwise, it will be inconsistent with the ministry's order and business conditions, and it will not be the central government's resolute intention to cut likin. We dare to present this humbly, hoping that you will consider it. Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully.</p>

The gang leader Zhou Xiuqing, who is at large, will be immediately arrested and investigated, and the case will be transferred to the judiciary for investigation after the provincial department and the high court and the Shanghai garrison command verify the matter.</p>

<p>Merchant Ships Robbed on a Major Route: The other day, two merchant ships from a rice store in Lili intended to transport rice to Zhujiajiao Town. As they approached the Xishi Shao Bridge and the Temple of the Flower Goddess near the town, a bandit boat suddenly appeared with five bandits aboard. Two bandits wielded wooden-cased guns, two carried long guns, and one unarmed bandit speaking with a northern accent intercepted and robbed the ships. The losses included clothing, silver dollars, and other items, totaling approximately one hundred yuan. Although the losses were relatively small, the location is a major thoroughfare for travelers. If the authorities do not strictly pursue and apprehend the bandits, merchants will be discouraged from traveling there. Consequently, various businesses in the town have jointly sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau and the Defense Corps, requesting investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars Transformed into Copper Coins: At a Zhu family residence in Jiangdun Port outside the North Gate of this city, dozens of bandits suddenly appeared one night, their faces mostly painted, and ransacked the house for about two hours. The losses were reportedly significant. Most strangely, two hundred dollars that the Zhu family had hidden on the roof were found to have turned into copper coins the next day. This incident suggests that the bandits were not without inside information.</p>

<p>Banditry Rampant in Taihu Lake During the Winter Defense Period: Banditry has resurged in Taihu Lake, especially in the Xishan area of Wuxian County. Robberies and kidnappings of boats and people occur almost daily. Hu, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, was alarmed by this and telegraphed Mao Mujun, the District Chief of the Second District of the Provincial Public Security Water Police of this county, ordering him to instruct his teams to patrol and strictly suppress the bandits. After receiving the order, District Chief Mao ordered Wang Wusheng, the captain of the Eighth Team, to diligently carry out the suppression. At the same time, District Chief Mao also received a letter from Huang Yunchen, the Magistrate of Wuxian County, stating that bandit ships had gathered near Wanhuagong Mountain in the county and were robbing civilian ships, requesting the dispatch of a team to the lake for joint suppression to deter the bandits and secure the winter defense. It is also reported that the residents along the lake find it difficult for the water and land police teams to suppress the lake bandits due to the need to wade through water and climb mountains, which has further emboldened the bandits. In order to address the urgent situation, it is proposed to build a long dike in Taihu Lake to connect the east and west mountains for communication. It will be easier to suppress the bandits if an alarm is raised.</p>

He telegraphed the provincial government and the financial and construction departments yesterday, reporting the difficulties in solicitation. The original text reads: "According to reports from various parties, Wu County has suffered frequent disasters for many years, and the people are impoverished. They request exemption. Despite repeated persuasion, I have almost exhausted myself. Whether we can meet the quota is uncertain. In addition to supervising the financial and construction bureaus to work together, actively soliciting, and reporting remittances as soon as they are obtained, I respectfully telegraph this report in advance." The police team captured bandit Tang Kanglin. The First Squadron, Third Platoon of the police team stationed in Wuxi Xiashe, received a report from the platoon leader Liu Zicheng that there were hidden bandits near Anjia She. He led the team to cooperate with the business corps. They found that the teahouse was performing Huangqiang opera and that Tang Kanglin, a bandit, was present. Tang was arrested along with the suspected accomplice Zhu Shengda. As they were escorting the suspects near Liheshangquan, they suddenly heard gunfire from behind, indicating an attempt to rescue the bandit. The police team immediately returned fire. However, a bullet struck Zhou Shunsheng, a member of the team, injuring him. Tang was escorted to the Xiashe team headquarters. During interrogation, he confessed to committing eight or nine cases of kidnapping, robbery, and murder without denying the charges. Zhu Shengda's statement was evasive.

They jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a review of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session and a prompt prohibition. They received a reply from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Upon review of the division of tax authority announced by the National Government, each entity should reorganize independently and not add surtaxes. The business tax is a local revenue source. The request from the chambers of commerce to prohibit the Rugao and Nantong education bureaus from collecting a 30% education fee is consistent with the approved proposal. The Ministry has instructed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and handle the matter. Please be informed."</p>

<p>School Accused of Encroaching on Official Land: The Qixiu Girls' School in Jiaxing is a private institution founded by the You family. Previously, due to a lack of a school site, the school obtained permission from the government to construct school buildings on more than six mu of official land in the Xicang area of Xiushui. However, the site is adjacent to the former residence of Yan Zhu, which the locals consider a historical site. Now, with the demolition of the city wall, the You family has encroached on more than twenty-nine mu of surrounding official land and historical sites, registering it as private property with the Zhongxiuli Committee. A citizen, Wang Liangchen, has submitted evidence to the County Construction Bureau accusing the school.

<p>Zhongshan University Students to Resume Classes</p>
<p>Jin Zengcheng is Surely Capable</p>
<p>Student Representatives Convey Dai Jitao's Words</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th: Zhu Jiahua telegraphed to Shen Yuncheng of Guangzhou Zhongshan University, relaying to faculty and students: "Arrived in Beijing on the 15th. The board meeting was held the next day, where Jiahua reported on all resolutions. The board has telegraphed Mr. Jin as the successor to the school. The board has repeatedly considered this result and the Central Government has appointed him, which cannot be changed. Now, the Central Government is strictly rectifying academic style. The university is a university commemorating the Premier and must first comply. The current disturbance is not something students should do and is forbidden by law and school discipline. I have repeatedly stated this in person and have announced it many times. With Mr. Jin's experience and talent, he will surely adhere to the board's position and continue the university's established direction and plan. It can be asserted that the faculty are here to lead the students. If the students do not think about studying hard and immediately resume classes under the established order, I fear that because of the students' unteachability, they will be discouraged. The students are running around and calling for the sake of learning, but the result is that there is no learning to seek, no teacher to obtain. This is not beneficial to the university or to the students themselves. For the sake of the university and the students themselves, I still earnestly hope that they will immediately return to class and study with peace of mind. Then, the development of the university will surely become more and more brilliant. As for the faculty, they are here to cultivate the students. The members of the board, Mr. Dai, and Jiahua will do their best to help them develop academically and lead the students. Mr. Dai is scheduled to return to Guangdong with Director Zhesheng next month to plan the construction of the new campus. This is telegraphed to you."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th: Li Shaohua, Li Zaixing, Zhou Kefa, and Zhang Guanying, representatives of the Guangzhou Zhongshan University Welcome Dai Reject Jin Movement Committee, telegraphed all students of the university on the 17th: "Arrived in Beijing yesterday and immediately visited Mr. Dai. Mr. Dai explained in detail that the Central Government's appointment of the president of the university was decided by Mr. Dai after repeated deliberation by the board. The board will be fully responsible for the future construction of the university and all fundamental issues. We hope that the students will obey the orders of the Central Government, trust the board's arrangements, quickly stop all irregular words and actions, and attend classes as usual. The university was founded by the Premier and should be a model for the whole country. Chairman Jiang himself concurrently serves as the Minister of Education and has issued orders to rectify academic style across the country. The students must not regard this as ordinary. If they do not change course quickly, not only will the honor of the university and years of hard work be reduced to nothing, but the future danger will also be unbearable. I urge you to quickly telegraph the students to order a resumption of classes. Mr. Dai's love for the university has been consistent from beginning to end. Regarding the construction of the new campus, construction must be started quickly and a meeting will be held in the first month to arrange for Director Sun Zhesheng to return to Guangdong to plan everything. This is telegraphed to you and the rest will be reported in person."</p>

In addition, in recent times, the administrative organizational laws of various universities have often been arbitrarily formulated without following the university organizational laws.

<p>Three Percent Education Surtax on Business Tax Rate</p>
<p>Submitted by Provincial Government to the Finance Department for Review</p>
<p>Director Chen of the Education Department, in view of the fact that the scripture donations of various departments have been ordered to be cancelled, and the winter shipping surcharge and late payment fines have been transferred to the provincial treasury, and after the implementation of the business tax, the slaughter and yamen taxes will be cancelled, resulting in a sudden reduction of more than 400,000 yuan in local education funds, which will inevitably cause a huge panic. He proposed that when the business tax is implemented in the future, a 30% surtax on local education funds should be levied to offset the losses. The proposal was submitted to the provincial government meeting on the 16th and the resolution was submitted to the Finance Department for review. The original proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>Upon careful investigation, since the scripture donation item in the local education funds of various counties was ordered to be cancelled by the Central Government, there has been no offsetting measure to date. The province is short approximately 100,000 yuan. In addition, the winter shipping surcharge and late payment fines are also transferred to the provincial treasury by the provincial government. The province is estimated to be short 300,000 yuan under the winter shipping surcharge item, and no less than 100,000 yuan under the late payment fine item. The above three items total a shortage of more than 500,000 yuan for the year. After the implementation of the business tax in the future, all slaughter surtaxes and yamen surtaxes in various counties may also be cancelled. This loss is even greater than the winter shipping surcharge and other items. If offsetting measures are not urgently planned at this time, it will be difficult to maintain local education in the second half of the 19th year. It is proposed that a 30% surtax on local education funds be levied when the business tax is implemented in the province to offset the losses and expand compulsory education in various counties. Whether or not this is appropriate is respectfully submitted for public decision.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Municipal Education Bureau Order <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Students who fail the summer school exam should take a make-up exam</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all schools to inform students who failed the summer school exam that they should wait for a make-up exam at a fixed time, and to submit the list of those waiting to take the exam by January 15th of next year. The order stated that the Bureau had previously formulated regulations for elementary school teachers' further studies to improve the effectiveness of elementary school teachers, and submitted them to the municipal government for approval and promulgation, and had ordered them to be followed. However, it was found that the summer school was held this summer vacation, and all students who passed the exam were issued certificates by the school. Those who failed the exam should have retaken the course at the next summer school according to Article 6 of the Further Study Regulations. However, since the summer school was held this summer vacation before the regulations were promulgated, it seemed that students who passed the exam this year could be considered to have entered the summer school for further study once according to the regulations, and students who failed the exam were allowed to take a make-up exam and then follow the regulations. The report was re-submitted to the municipal government and approved for flexible handling. It is now found that 98 students of the summer school, including Yu Yu, failed more than two-fifths of the subjects they studied.

<p>Medical University Wins Over Tongwen</p>
<p>Fifty-Six to Thirty</p>
<p>Game Against All Blacks Tonight</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Medical University basketball team made its debut at the Chinese Basketball Hall at 6 PM last night. After forty minutes of hard work, they defeated Tongwen College, leaving no survivors. The final score was fifty-six to thirty. Referee Shao Ji will referee the game between All Blacks and Nagasaki Medical University at the original venue at 7 PM tonight. The game between All Blacks B and Nanguang will start at 6 PM.</p>
<p>The game began with Nagasaki Medical University being penalized. Tongwen's He Cun hoped to score, but the ball did not go in. It then fell into the hands of Nagasaki Medical University, and they scored twelve points in a row like a string of beads. Then Tongwen's Tian Yufang opened the scoring. When Nagasaki Medical University scored 17 points, Tongwen scored their second goal. The third goal was scored after Nagasaki Medical University scored 19 points. The first half ended from then on. The athletes of Nagasaki Medical University were seen flying back and forth and constantly scoring. In the first half, Nagasaki Medical University scored 23 points and Tongwen scored 6 points.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Tongwen showed great improvement. The three forwards tried their best to make up for their failures. They were all agile and everyone was heroic. Soon the score difference became fourteen to twenty-five. Nagasaki Medical University had a contemptuous attitude and the forwards and guards exchanged positions. When it was time, they readjusted and sought further development. Sure enough, after five minutes, the distance widened again. As a result, Nagasaki Medical University won by fifty-six to twenty. Tongwen's skills were very immature. Their performance in the West Qing Basketball B Group Tournament was also mediocre. Last night, they only managed to be heroic once at the beginning of the second half when the opponent was negligent. Other than that, they were trampled under the iron hooves of a strong enemy and were at their mercy. The Nagasaki Medical University team has good qualities and their skills are quite proficient. The team's strategy has not been seen to be particularly afraid of war. Their strength seems to be similar to that of All Blacks, Zhonggong, Fudan, and Huyu Middle School. They are not enough to compete with Jiannan, John, and Xiqing. However, they are more than enough to defeat Tongwen.</p>

<p>The Jinan University football and basketball teams are scheduled to depart for the Philippines on January 6th for the competition.

The telegram included GGTA, which, according to telegraph rules, is calculated as one word for every ten characters, but the telegraph office must calculate it as three words and there are no regulations to rely on and the language is rude. Jinan University then telegraphed the Pacific Company, which still calculated it as one word.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Random Thoughts on Traveling to America by Ma Bolu <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>I have aspired to travel to America for ten years, and now my wish has finally been fulfilled. Isn't this the happiest thing in my life? On August 29th, I boarded an American mail ship and crossed the Pacific Ocean. I arrived in San Francisco on the 17th of the following month. I disembarked and traveled by land, visiting famous cities such as Chicago and New York for more than a month. I have seen a lot on my journey, but I cannot record everything in detail. I will only briefly mention one or two things that I feel are worth telling my fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>America's current economic status has changed from a debtor nation to a creditor nation thanks to the gift of the European War. Therefore, the evolution of its domestic industry and the rapid progress of its industry and commerce are enough to hold the reins of the world without shame. The development of transportation and the speed of telecommunications are particularly important for the progress of industry and commerce. For example, in the United States, from east to west, the distance is ten thousand miles, and phone calls can be made in an instant. Telegrams can be received and sent along the way. This allows for the effective integration of businesses that manage thousands of people with branches spread across various locations. Other advantages include the development of cooperative systems, the meticulousness of management methods, and the implementation of labor policies. The most surprising thing is the prosperity of machinery. Everything that once relied on manual labor will now be mechanized. For example, from the coordination of raw materials to the drying, printing, packaging, boxing, and shipping of Palmolive soap in a Palmolive soap factory, it can be shipped out in the blink of an eye, and its speed and precision are hundreds of times better than manual labor. In the offices of major factories, there are often inventions that can replace employees with machines, and the act of laying off employees has become more and more serious. From this point of view, science and machinery are constantly innovating, and the panic of unemployment is becoming more and more serious. Everything in the world has its advantages and disadvantages, and it all depends on whether there are methods to remedy it.</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese people in the United States, in addition to studying abroad, live in the Chinatowns of various cities. These streets are designated by the American government as special administrative regions, similar to foreign settlements. Upon entering these streets, one feels an infinite sense of sadness. The prevalence of gambling is no less than that in China. Gambling signs are blatantly hung outside windows, and the appearance of passers-by is often unkempt. Bookstores only sell sex history books. Such decadent customs have actually become popular overseas, which is beyond my initial expectations.</p>
<p>My purpose in going to the United States was to investigate. I have interacted with the owners of major factories and famous figures in the business world. However, I believe that my talent is insufficient and my knowledge is limited. During my interactions with people from that country, I never showed weakness. I exhausted all my knowledge to tell them anything that could promote the glory of the country. For example, the ongoing war in China is viewed with jealousy by foreigners, and the true reasons for the war are unclear. The news reported in the newspapers is often untrue, so China is seen as a country that loves chaos. I then strongly refuted their misconceptions and cited the precedent of the United States, which took eight years of war to establish a republic, to prove that China's war is a just war and a process that cannot be avoided by a revolutionary country. As a result, some people agreed with my words and praised my talent and knowledge as rare among Chinese in America. I couldn't help but laugh. I just smiled.</p>
<p>Wife: Do you remember what day it is today?</p>
<p>Husband: Today is December 20th.</p>
<p>Wife: I know that too, but do you remember what relationship it has with us?</p>
<p>Husband: I don't know.</p>
<p>Wife: Fool, have you forgotten that today is our silver wedding anniversary, the 25th anniversary of our marriage?</p>
<p>Husband: Damn it, damn it, I really forgot.</p>
<p>Wife: I want to kill a pig and invite friends and relatives to celebrate.</p>
<p>Husband (bitter smile): You already killed a big pig 25 years ago, which should have been enough for him. Why bother killing again?</p>
<p>A: You are really the happiest person, and I envy you very much.</p>
<p>B: But look at your child, with a fat head and big ears and a face full of blessings. Like father, like son, that saying is really true. Sorry, I happen to have an urgent need today. Is it possible to borrow fifty dollars?</p>
<p>A: Sorry, this child was born to my wife's ex-husband and has nothing to do with me. Please ask my wife's ex-husband for the fifty dollars.</p>
<p>Donkey Driver (driving his donkey forward, carrying extremely heavy things): Hurry, hurry, walk quickly, walk quickly.</p>
<p>Passerby: How can a donkey carry so many things?</p>
<p>Donkey Driver (the donkey stumbled on a stone and couldn't get up):</p>
<p>Sir, please help me. These things are very heavy, and one donkey alone can't handle it.</p>
<p>Typical businessman. From this, it can be seen that the outstanding people in our country have too little contact with people from that country. Looking at the Japanese in America, they spare no effort to protect their motherland. Whether it is politics, culture, industry, or commerce, they spare no effort to promote anything that benefits their country. The government does not hesitate to spend huge sums of money every year to set up propaganda agencies everywhere. Therefore, the news of the countries in the Far East relies on their dissemination, which is often inaccurate. It is hoped that our countrymen will catch up quickly, first by organizing well-structured travel groups to visit and promote. This will hopefully remedy the various obstacles, and the various economic, political, cultural, industrial, and commercial aspects between countries will be able to develop in a good direction. It is only that the number of unemployed workers in the United States has reached millions, and the lives of one to two million people have been affected. At present, they hope that China will accommodate as much of their surplus raw materials and industrial products as possible. Moreover, Americans have always been known for their goodwill towards China. Recently, due to the relationship between sellers and customers, they have expressed their warm friendship even more enthusiastically. Therefore, if the Chinese people can gladly visit, they will definitely treat them sincerely. The mutually beneficial interests of the two major countries may become even more complete because of this, which is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Banquet of Mr. and Mrs. Wang Yachen Hosted for Fan Shumei <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>On the 12th of the month, painter Wang Yachen and his wife, Rong Junli, hosted a banquet at the exhibition hall of the China Society on Weihaiwei Road to entertain the initiators, friends from the press, and literary and artistic circles. Shumei was also invited and arrived at around 6 p.m. that day. First, he viewed the works of Mr. and Mrs. Wang, totaling more than 130 pieces, displayed in eight rooms, creating a grand spectacle. It was an unprecedented painting exhibition in Shanghai, not only because of the excellent content of the works but also because of the suitability of the venue. Among the guests that day were the initiators of the exhibition, Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Li Shizeng, as well as Huang Binhong, Li Zuhan, Zhou Shoujuan, Ge Gongzhen, Li Haoran, Zhu Yingpeng, Wu Jingxiong, Li Gufan, Li Zongkan, Xu Zhimo, and others, totaling over fifty people. During the banquet, Mr. Wang elaborated on his impressions of his travels in Europe, saying, "After traveling all over Europe, I realized that Chinese modern culture is not promoted enough. Everything that Europe possesses now has been occupied by the Japanese. After returning to China this time, I must contact domestic and foreign artists to first work with the government to organize Chinese art from ancient to modern times, and then cooperate with various European countries." Mr. Cai and Mr. Li expressed great agreement with Mr. Wang's proposal. After the banquet, they invited national painters and the two gentlemen to have a long conversation about establishing a Shanghai Art Museum and subsidizing students studying abroad in academic fields. Mr. Wang said, "Recently, there are many students studying art abroad, but most of them cannot continue their studies due to financial difficulties and often drop out because of livelihood problems. If we can find a way to provide some subsidies to those studying art abroad, whether from the government or social organizations, it will not be difficult for Chinese people to achieve good results in the future." He also said, "When I lived in Italy, I learned that Mussolini, in order to help artists, negotiated with the national bank to allow poor artists to borrow money from the bank to help them with their research and gradually repay it after their works become famous. This is indeed a great initiative to promote the country's art." Recent Feelings on Domestic Culture</p>

<p>From Na Mao to Mei Miao, it is a one-day train ride. The third-class fare is six yuan, and the second-class fare is three times that. In Na Mao, each package of opium costs twenty-five yuan, but if brought to Mei Miao, it can be worth one hundred and twenty-five yuan. The profit is so great that it is difficult to prohibit. Because of the great profit, opium cases in Hankou and Shanghai are constantly occurring and can never be prohibited. What can be done? Master Wanhui told me that the Burmese people quite despise the Chinese because their character is base and their morality is not high. Since arriving in Burma, Chinese people not only sell opium, white pills, and other harmful substances to the Burmese people, but also engage in gambling, deception, and other improper behaviors, which have a negative impact on Burmese society. In the future, the Burmese people's xenophobic sentiments will increase, and the Chinese will also be eliminated. This is self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Those who have become Burmese through marrying Burmese wives, being born to Burmese mothers, or believing in Buddhism are all on the path to becoming Burmese. The Chongzhu Sacred Society in Yangon is a group of Chinese who believe in Burmese Buddhism. However, after becoming Burmese, they often have contempt for the Chinese and do not associate with them. Their language, customs, and beliefs all change, and they become a different race. The reason they despise the Chinese is that the Chinese have brought it upon themselves, as their morals and habits are not worthy of admiration in the eyes of the Burmese.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m., I arrived in Mei Miao and toured a Japanese orchard with Zhuang Haiquan and Yang Shuanglin. It has 3,000 fruit trees and an annual income of 100,000 yuan. The four Japanese have several guns to guard it, and the capital is not very large. It is quite impressive. Most of the trees are pear trees, followed by grapevines. The price of pears is one yuan per pound, but the taste is not good, not as good as the pears from Nanjing and Shanghai. They are grown by grafting onto willow trees, yet they still yield such high profits. This is because Nanyang is far from other places, and even with refrigerators, the pears are not as tasty, so the growers make a great profit. I also encourage people to operate orchards here, which is very suitable for nourishing life. There is no place in the tropical Nanyang that is as cool and refreshing as Mei Miao. If a sanatorium hospital is also operated here, it will surely be profitable.</p>
<p>After dinner, I took a car to Mandalay, which is known for its large jackfruits. Women sell them in gardens and along the road, making a considerable profit. After 9 p.m., I arrived in Mandalay and stayed at Mr. Zong Jiu'an's residence at the Jiyi Public Association.</p>
<p>are lagging behind and there is little hope of saving them. If one can have the aspirations and dedication of Mr. Wang, the domestic art scene will surely shine in the future. Mr. Wang is currently thirty-seven years old and has extraordinary ideas. His future technical achievements are immeasurable. Mrs. Junli studied painting at the Paris National School of Fine Arts in Europe and brought back many achievements. The efforts of Mr. and Mrs. Wang are especially admirable. Before leaving, I heard that various sectors of society requested that the exhibition be extended for three days until the 21st. After returning home, I felt that this exhibition and today's banquet were extraordinary, so I wrote this record. (No remuneration accepted)</p>

<p>Wenhu, also known as lantern riddles, is the most elegant form of entertainment for poets and men of letters. There are those who have read ten thousand volumes of books but cannot create or guess a riddle. Creating and guessing riddles rely entirely on wit and inspiration, not hard work. Those who read books to death are like looking at the ocean and sighing. Recently, the owner of the New World suddenly gathered masters of Wenhu to create lantern riddles in the Yaxu Hall every night. Many people came to guess them, and there were some humorous riddles that made people burst into laughter. Here are some brief notes: Why are men competing for the wind?

<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (13)</p>
<p>June 4 丨 St. Peter's Basilica 丨 Vatican Palace 丨 Sistine Chapel 丨</p>
<p>We followed the crowd into the inner hall, which was entirely built of colorful marble. Looking around from the top of the dome, you could see red stone, green stone, and black stone arranged in a decorative pattern. The two rows of grand white stone square pillars in the main hall were adorned with many reliefs inlaid with red stone. Each ring door was inlaid with beautiful colored stones to form a pattern. Standing and walking here, I felt a sense of mystery enveloping my whole body. Its (profound) (grand) openness and boundlessness were completely unlike the gloomy, constrained, and oppressive feeling of walking into Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The altar in the main hall was supported by four marble pillars carved from black marble. The base of the canopy was also carved from white stone with giant statues. The center was filled with contributions from the Pope and the nobility, gold and silver, and colorful decorations. Below, stairs were filled with pure white lilies, leading to a cave. This is the tomb of St. Peter.</p>
<p>Dozens of white-robed or red-robed bishops were singing and praying behind the altar. The loud and harmonious sounds expressed the praise of the great God. To the right was a bronze statue of St. Peter, said to be a relic from the fourth century. Believers bowed to the statue and touched his right toe, softly expressing their prayers.</p>
<p>Dozens of side halls and chapels were arranged on both sides. Each chapel was inlaid with magnificent (mosaic) MOSAICO, depicting the life of the Virgin Mary and Christ. Some were pure gold backgrounds inlaid with colorful jewels, while others were inlaid with colorful stones like oil paintings, making it impossible to distinguish them. The surrounding decorations were also very elaborate. The dome in the center of each chapel altar was an extremely beautiful relief, surrounded by dazzling jewels. The front of the altar was decorated with carved sandalwood railings, dazzling and magnificent, truly evoking many strange feelings in us. To the left was the second chapel, where Pope Leo XIII was buried. Below were the tombs of many popes. Its attached sculptures and all internal decorations had an astonishing expressiveness in architecture. The area of the world's largest church was engraved on the floor of the front of the temple. The area of St. Peter's Basilica exceeded 255,000 cubic feet, making it the largest church building. The area of the Milan DUOMO and London's St. Paul's Cathedral was 118,300 cubic feet, and the area of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople was 107,000 cubic feet. The rest were far behind.</p>

<p>The Gold Market is a Wild Storm</p>
<p>The fluctuations are extremely alarming</p>
<p>Unprecedented records reappear</p>
<p>The market situation is extremely confusing Yesterday, the gold market situation on December 18th</p>
<p>Initially weak and then strong, the changes were very dramatic. The earth-shattering momentum rose and fell suddenly, giving a sense of strange winds and strange rains. Colleagues were shocked and at a loss. In an instant, the turnover of three or four taels was not unusual. The unified market even counted a difference of seventeen taels. The forward market once broke through the 50 tael mark. The overseas silver market saw a rise, as the United States still had the theory of maintaining silver prices. However, the foreign exchange also rose by half a grade. The domestic market changed from loose to strong, and Taikang, Runyu, Daxieyu, and others in the field had sales. Afterwards, the exchange rate improved, especially as major speculators bought fiercely, such as Hengxingchang, Shengyongyuanmao, Yongdadecheng, etc., with constant momentum. It was also heard that overseas telegrams indicated that the United States would find it difficult to save the decline of the silver market. The market was greatly encouraged by this news, and the price suddenly jumped thousands of feet. After soaring by ten taels, the market became more and more lively. Buyers were constantly excited, and the exchange rate became even tighter. The market atmosphere soared, and the price rushed out of the 60 tael mark. It was also an unprecedented new record of 664.5 taels. However, the state was confused and chaotic, with fluctuations of one or two taels from time to time. Afterwards, it was said that the large transaction would fall again this morning with a zero of 60 taels.</p>
<p>A soft trend appeared in the early morning. The opening price of gold in February in the morning was 653 taels and 8 qian, a decrease of 3 taels and 8 qian (the gross market price dropped from over 57 taels to 4 taels, indicating that sellers seemed to be strong). The large transaction returned to a length of sixteen and three points. The silver price increased by a quarter, and the private telegraph increased by 4.375. The Japanese and American exchange rates fell by a sixteenth. Later, Taikang, Run, Richang, and others sold very strongly, and continued to fall sharply by 6 taels, breaking through 50 taels to 48 taels. Then, Yuancheng, Yongyuanheng, and others chased after it, jumping up by more than 3 taels, to 51 taels and a half. The first order was still level. Initially, Mitsui entered 1.54375 in March, and then sold it at the same price. As the opening price had already been raised to 1.25 US dollars, the gold price fell by 1.25, and then fell to around 50 taels. Then it became 59 taels and 2 qian. The domestic market also suffered. Banks made mutual transactions of 1.54375 in January and this month. Before long, there were slightly more buyers in the market, so at 10 o'clock it was 52 taels, 2 and 3 qian. Suddenly, Dadecheng, Xieyu, and zero households sold, and the British gold for this month was suddenly broken again to 50 taels, to a low of 47 taels and 2 qian at more than 10:20. Afterwards, banks such as Zhenjin and Shanghai absorbed 3 months of British gold at 1.5 halft tael. HSBC also made advances of 2 shillings 05625 to 625 for the British-Japanese exchange rate in January. As a result, people's hearts returned to firmness, and Taichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Yuanmao, Yongdadecheng, Changsheng, Yongchengfengyong, and others competed to buy enthusiastically. The market price had a promising future, and soared by 10 taels. It was also said that the international conference believed that the United States was difficult to save the tragic decline of the silver price. Speculator Mr. Wu bought a lot, but there were occasional ups and downs of one or two taels. At noon, the market closed at 58 taels, again raising it by 2 taels. The goods made a violent advance, suddenly breaking through the 60 tael mark. The opening price has been changed to 691 taels and 6 qian, because the Japanese gold price is small by 1.25 qian, initially pressing 412 taels, and at noon it was 34 taels.</p>
<p>The highest point in the afternoon was 64 taels and a half. The market opened at 60 taels and 8 qian (the gross market was over 61 taels). Afterwards, due to the increase of the Indian exchange rate of ten anna, it immediately dropped to 58 taels. Before long, Hengxing, Bingxing, Yongheng, and others bought one after another, and the foreign exchange also stabilized. Shanghai issued 4 months of British gold at 1.525, and also made mutual transactions with Korea in March at 1.875. The Sumitomo in Dalian issued 1 tael, 4 qian, 2 fen, and 2.5 qian. However, the gold market suddenly broke through 60 taels. However, the sellers were also unrelenting. Yuanmao, Yongtaikang, Run, and others all divested. So, there was a twist or turn of one or two taels at that time. After 2:30, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had returned to being small, and Chengfengyongdadecheng and others were in strong buying mood. In March, British gold was only settled at 1.5125. The wheat company absorbed 1.125, and the gold market reached its peak. At 3:00, it reached 64 taels and a half. Afterwards, because of the divestment, Hongli and Yuanxingyong all came out. The wheat company also issued 3 months of British gold at 1.5125. Zhenjin issued 3 months of Toyo gold at 1 tael, 4 qian, and 3 points, and also issued 1 month of British gold at 1.51875. Therefore, the price suddenly dropped by 4 taels. At 3:30, it was 60 taels and 2 qian. Suddenly, it added another 3 taels. Zhifengyong bought it. After 4 o'clock, the transaction was 63 taels and 3 qian. Finally, the goods came out again, dropping back to 60 taels and 2 qian. However, the turbulence of people's hearts was indescribable. At 4:30, the market closed at 60 taels and 8 qian, an increase of 3 taels and 2 qian compared to the previous day. It was made to 61 taels inside and outside again. The largest price of the day was 64 taels and a half, and the smallest price was 47 taels and 2 qian, a difference of 17 taels and 3 qian. The early market for goods was 53 taels and a half, the noon closing price was 60 taels, the afternoon was 60 taels and 7 qian, and the closing price was 60 taels and a half. The opening price was 31 taels, and the ledger was 12. In January, it was 55 taels, and in February, it was 58 taels. The water replenishment was 55 taels, and in the afternoon it was 58 taels.</p>
<p>The Dalian gang chased up more than 4,000 bars. The transactions of the same industry generally sought more than supplied. Dadecheng, Yongfeng, Yuanxingyong, Yuanheng, Yonghengshunli, Wanxing, Fuchangyuan, Chenghengxing, Chengfengyong, and others all entered. Changsheng Yongdai Wu bought fiercely. Taichangyuan Tai Zhifengyong had huge ins and outs. Yu Daxie Yu Taikang Run Richang goods all came out. In the afternoon, Chengfengyong Changsheng Yong Wanxingshunli Bingxing Hengxing Yongheng Yu Dada De cheng all entered. Yuanmao Yong Taikang Yongfeng Richang all came out. The remaining numbers have their own way, and the ins and outs are uncertain. The Dalian gang chased up a total of more than 4,000 bars, and then issued 1,600 to 1,700 bars. The Guangdong gang slightly resisted.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Foreign exchange listings rise by half a grade <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The domestic market was initially loose and then strong, and the market situation was chaotic.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets both saw an increase, while the Indian exchange rate shrank. The British-American exchange rate rose slightly, and the market situation was flat. The Kobe market did not change. However, HSBC's listings for each exchange rate increased by half a grade. British gold was 1.25, now 1 shilling and 5 pence 1.25. 25 US dollars was 34 yuan and 625. The Indian exchange rate increased by 75, now 96 rupees. The French franc increased by 7 yuan, now 882 yuan. The German exchange rate increased by 75, now 145 marks and 25. The Japanese-Western exchange rate increased by 75, now 86 shields. The Po exchange rate decreased by 1 tael, now 162 taels and a half. Hong Kong decreased by 5 qian, now 78 taels. Japanese gold decreased by 1 fen and 25, now 1 tael, 4 qian, 3 fen, and 25. As for the bank's domestic market, it was initially weak and then tight, especially in the afternoon. It was no less than a clear tightening, which was the scene of the gold market turning from weak to strong. However, the wind and waves were fierce and incomparable, with more than ten taels of twists and turns. In the afternoon, it suddenly rushed out of 64 taels, and the new high continued to be seen. Near the closing of the market, each increase compared to the previous day was 125 to 1875 for British gold, 375 for prize gold, and 1.25 fen for Japanese gold. The chaos of the market could not be stopped. Chinese gold companies sold fiercely in the forward market and then pushed forward in the after market. A total of 200,000 pounds of British gold were sold. Banks plus Mitsui, Datong, Korea, Shanghai, Zhenjin, etc. all absorbed it. In the afternoon, Shanghai Zhongfu and others sold about 100,000 pounds of gold. Various banks mutually transacted more than 100,000 pounds. US dollars were traded more than 200,000 yuan, and Chinese merchants sold more than 100,000 yuan. Japanese gold in the afternoon was settled by the Dalian gang for more than 1 million yuan. It was sold by Mitsui, Huabi, Sumitomo, Mitsui, and Zhenjin. The sharpness of the market atmosphere was quite prosperous. It was almost yesterday afternoon that Reuters reported the British meeting on the financial case, and that the United States was also difficult to save the sharp decline of the silver market. Therefore, large silver and other companies were afraid that there would be another drop. Yesterday afternoon, Mitsui sold to HSBC British-Japanese exchange rates for January, calculated as 2 shillings 05625 to 625.</p>

<p>Market Overview: As the year draws to a close, most Lishi [a type of money exchange market] businesses are declaring the end of operations and are not expanding. Therefore, the situation is bleak and unremarkable, with market prices generally falling, but without drastic changes. Banks are also simply completing closing procedures, with no new transactions developing. News of incoming and outgoing customers is also as sluggish as ever. Auxiliary currencies are now also stable.</p>

(Silver Lishi) was even lower than the previous day, with both morning and afternoon markets at 4 fen. There was still no addition of water [inflationary currency dilution], and business was conducted in "white" currency [pure silver].

<p>Yesterday, the current price of public bonds opened at 24,000 yuan. The futures market trading was still sluggish, but the transaction volume slightly increased compared to the previous day, totaling 6 million yuan in the morning and afternoon. The bond market's supply and demand was quite balanced. Buyer sentiment was quiet, and the stagnant situation was no different than before. Price fluctuations were still minor. However, the results for closing positions were more active, so prices generally increased. Domestic "六厘" bonds [6% interest bonds] were up slightly.</p>
<p>Closing prices varied with "一九关" bonds [1919 Customs bonds] falling 7 to 8 jiao, foreign bonds rising about 2 jiao, and other bonds seeing an increase around 2 jiao.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Tends Towards Rising Prices</p>
<p>Settlements Are Delayed, Foreign Markets Improve, and Demand Needs to Expand</p>
<p>The yarn market has seen a sharp rise in prices, mainly because the base was too low.</p>
<p>Non-industry players are able to delay settlements by one and a half months. Inland firms are currently purchasing over 1,000 bales of yarn, coupled with a sudden improvement in overseas market conditions. As a result, sentiment has become firmer, and the reaction is more intense. General speculators, seeing poor conditions and insufficient strength, have to painfully close out their positions, resulting in this intense price surge. However, Japanese and Chaozhou merchants are still selling large volumes of long-term contracts. The current situation is naturally tense. If actual sales can continue to be smooth, there is still upward potential, but there are still thick underlying inventories.</p>
<p>The "人标" [Human Standard] is Up Two Liangs. The foreign "标" [standard] opened in the market with a rebound in long-depressed American cotton, greatly boosting sentiment. Buying was strong, and prices rose by one liang. The second and third rounds of trading remained firm and rose another three or four liang. It was heard that current sales were good, and prices rose again at the close. The afternoon opening was even stronger, with retail investors rushing to cover their short positions, and bulls taking the opportunity to buy, driving prices up another five or six qian. The Chaozhou and Japanese merchants were selling, and the market atmosphere slightly calmed. Checking current yarn transactions, only inland firms were actively purchasing, some of which had speculative intentions.

<p>Bulls Aggressively Pulling Prices Up Front, Han Merchants Frantically Buying in the Back</p>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply because long-depressed American cotton suddenly rebounded. Recently, the exchange rate has shrunk dramatically, and gold prices have soared, causing the bulls to exert even more pressure. Buying is strong, and the Han merchants are aggressively buying to cover their short positions, making the market atmosphere even tighter. In addition, the yarn market is reacting very strongly, making the cotton market feel even firmer.</p>
<p>Long-term standard cotton rises by six qian. The Exchange's Han Standard opened with a rebound in American cotton, and buying was strong, with each increasing by four or five qian. The afternoon trading rose another two qian. Total transaction volume for the day was estimated at 86,500 dan. Selling included 7,000 dan of Rongxing and 3,500 dan of Hengde, with the remaining two or three thousand dan.

Futures rose 34 to 40 points, and spot prices rose 35 points. English cotton futures rose 1 to 1.5 points, and spot prices rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged.

<p>Grain and Rice Market Stabilizes</p>
<p>In Zhabei, the market for rice arriving from sources over 20 miles away has gradually weakened. Buyers of Northern japonica rice are now focusing on upper-middle quality, while inquiries for middle to lower-grade japonica rice have become rare. The overall market has shifted to a stable situation with prices being high and firm for top grades but weak for lower grades. Special high-quality rice is still hovering between 14.1 and 14.2 yuan. Thin-husked rice sales are weak, and prices are stable. Indica rice buying is slightly weaker than before, and transactions are sparse, but the source is not large, so it is relatively stable. There is a large inventory of Dujian [a type of rice], and sales rely entirely on retail, with no significant price fluctuations. The price of Shanghai rice is hovering around 12 yuan, and the market continues to be sluggish with extremely slow sales. Prices are high because there is no special top-quality rice, and buyers can still choose their purchases. However, ordinary medium-grade rice can be described as stagnant and sparsely traded, with prices gradually declining. The arrival and acceptance of Yinyuan [a type of currency] are weak, and the original prices are maintained.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai, not much cargo arrived from the river. The liquidation of high-quality white rice is active, and the regular white rice market is stabilizing, but top-quality rice is in short supply. Ordinary high-quality rice sales are particularly popular. There are slight fluctuations in the rice from Suzhou and Tongji, because the sales market prefers medium-grade rice. High-quality rice sales are weak and slightly lowered. Early and thin-husked rice sources from Southern firms have seen prosperity since the weather cleared. Sales were flat. Customer firms inquired about Yangdu Xian [a type of rice], and transactions were rare. The arrival and sales of Yinyuan rice were depressed, and transactions were scarce.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Over a Thousand Bags of Newly Arrived Hunan Rice Put on Sale <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market appetite for customer indica rice was very active, and the market was also good. A new batch of Hunan rice arrived and over a thousand bags were put on sale. The market situation was more positive than before. Xiamen firms also arranged for "机元" [a type of rice], because the year-end settlement can be extended to February 15, which is in line with the traditional lunar year-end customs. The market sentiment has turned positive. Total transactions in the market were 600 bags of Hunan Jiyuan rice at 12.3 to 12 yuan, over 200 bags of Hunan Jijing rice at 11.2 yuan, and over 100 bags of "机油" [a type of rice] at 11.3 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 38 bags of "" [a type of rice] were priced at 10 yuan and 2 jiao per bag, and 773 bags of Shuang "砶" red rice were priced at 9 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. 600 bags of Jiangxi Ji early rice were priced at 10 yuan and 3 jiao. Except for Jiyuan rice, which was purchased by Xiamen firms, all other rice was taken by local firms, it was said.</p>
<p>Silk, Tea, and Silk Factories Struggle to Raise Cocoon Prices</p>
<p>Since all Shanghai silk factories suspended operations in the middle of last month, the market price of boiled cocoons has suddenly risen sharply. Subsequently, due to the yarn unraveling period and other factors, silk factories have gradually resumed operations. There are about 40 factories now, and the production volume of boiled cocoons has gradually increased. However, European sales are sluggish, and only inland merchants are actively purchasing, making it difficult to raise prices. Yesterday, the market price for silk factory goods was only 18 liang and a half, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Silk Merchants Actively Purchasing Coarse Yellow and White Silk <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in Shanghai continued to be quiet. Overseas silk telegrams were not transmitted. However, because the silk merchants from the Lake region have been approved by the Ministry of Finance to be exempt from taxes on the silk they purchase for transport to the Lake region, they are actively purchasing coarse silk for this reason. Due to the lack of smooth transactions, only 20 bales of coarse silk from the Lake region under Seven Mile warp were purchased, with the prices remaining low and sluggish, it was said.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Dumping, Dutch Red Sugar Prices Rise, Market Is Popular</p>
<p>"划盘" [likely a term for auction trading] Transactions Are Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, news from the sugar producing regions stated that the current sugar price in Cuba was still 1.25. New York futures sugar saw a rebound, with the December price up 4 points, the March-May next year price up 7 points, and the September price up 8 points. The current term of Javanese sugar fell by 1-2 points. The public market "划盘" [likely a term for auction trading] price of Dutch sugar 24 raw white sugar was still 8 liang and 4 qian and a half, and transactions were smooth and the market was generally flat. The trend of 8 liang and 5 qian and 2 and a half fen for fine white sugar, and 7 liang and 7 qian for 20 medium white sugar was relatively strong. Japanese sugar transactions were even scarcer, and the market atmosphere was better. N Maike [likely brand name] was at 8 liang and 7 qian and a half, TK Maike was at 8 liang and 5 qian and a half, and Meiji PY Maike had a small number of transactions at slightly less than 9 liang. Minghua YRO Maike shouted for 8 liang, YT Maike shouted for 8 liang and 5 qian, and YP was at 9 liang. Due to the buyer's willingness to accept the price being only 5 fen, and the household was still tightening, they held their positions and there were no transactions. However, the market was flat and lacking in excitement. Taikoo car sugar PX Maike put out 2-3 thousand packages of goods that are immediately installed, which are newly regulated and taxed, which felt fashionable. The "抛货" [dumping] Dutch sugar Sun Quanlong foreign firm sold this month's shipment of 150 tons of Dutch red 8 sugar at 5 yuan and 4 jiao in Dutch currency, and 125 tons of number 10 goods at 5 yuan and 6 jiao, all of which are newly regulated and taxed, and the market is fashionable. There are domestic goods, including 30 boxes of Tongshou Bingjia Mei brand at 6 liang and 5 qian and 50 boxes of Taimei brand at 6 liang and 4 qian. The market trends are strong.</p>
<p>The number plates for dried longan from North and South Goods are firm.</p>
<p>Dried longan has recently arrived with thirty pieces, among which large-petal dried meat is no more than a few pieces. Yesterday, samples were seen, the color is still to be pushed, the body is soft, and the price was immediately opened at 43 liang. Compared with the previous tray, it was only a few pennies up and down, and there were also more than 20 boxes of Xiamen goods, which also opened at a price of 30 liang and a half. The market is stable. The Shen stock is not thick, and land prices are still standing firm and difficult to relax.</p>

<p>Chairman Jiang Will Go to Hankou in a Few Days</p>
<p>Jiangxi's Finances Have a Proposed Solution</p>
<p>The Reorganization of Domestic and Foreign Debt is Underway</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen, upon receiving a telegram from Chairman Jiang, traveled by plane from Nanjing to Xunyang [Jiangxi province] and then to Lushan to meet and discuss various issues such as the reorganization of Jiangxi province's finances, and participated in the Guling Military Conference. After returning to Nanjing, he took the overnight train to Shanghai. He arrived at 7 a.m. yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 p.m., he went to the Central Bank building to work and meet with leaders of the banking industry. He took the 11 p.m. overnight train to Nanjing that evening. This newspaper reporter visited him. According to Mr. Song, this time he was summoned by Chairman Jiang to discuss the issue of Jiangxi's finances, and a considerable solution has now been proposed. The rumors that he came to Shanghai to raise funds for suppressing bandits are completely untrue. Because he has not been to Shanghai for a long time, he took time out of his busy schedule to make a trip. Chairman Jiang will stay in Jiangxi for another four or five days and then go to Hankou for inspection. The reorganization of domestic and foreign debt is currently underway. He cannot disclose the situation because it is not yet time for publication. When the reporter inquired about how to deal with the Nishihara loans and whether they would not be included in the reorganization of foreign debt, Mr. Song also declined to comment. Regarding the issue of new tariffs, Mr. Song said that they are well prepared and will be announced as scheduled, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Citywide Pawn Shop Workers' General Strike Yesterday <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Scheduled Mediation for the 21st</p>
<p>The Trade Association Agreed to Send Representatives</p>
<p>Assistance from All Sides Kept Order Tranquil Yesterday</p>
<p>The citywide pawn shop workers, considering that the owners did not accept the mediation calls from party and government organs and had no other recourse, declared a unified strike yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strike Situation: A total of 109 pawn shops, old and new, citywide, with over 3,000 workers. (1) In the Eastern District, all 32 pawn shops went on strike yesterday, with only Shengkang Pawnshop on Wusong Road partially open. (2) In the Southern District, the 18 pawn shops originally operated as usual yesterday morning due to suppression by the owners, but after persuasion by the investigation team, Tongchang and other pawnshops all went on strike. (3) All 17 pawn shops in the Western District went on strike. (4) In the Northern District, all 13 pawn shops went on strike except for the Chaozhou-owned Zikang Pawnshop, which joined the strike in the afternoon. (5) All 28 pawn shops in the Central District went on strike, with only Yuanlai on Fuzhou Road and Yuchang on Sanma Road open as usual. However, after special team leader Cheng Xingzhu led his entire team to persuade them, they also closed.</p>
<p>Notice to Members: The Strike Committee posted a notice in front of the meeting hall yesterday morning, informing all members, stating roughly: (Regarding the matter of the notice: It has been decided by this committee to commence the strike on the 18th. All members are to absolutely respect all resolutions of this committee and accept the command of this committee. Those who disobey openly and comply secretly, willing to ingratiate themselves with the owners and undermine the front of this committee, will be strictly dealt with. They must also strictly maintain order inside and outside the meeting hall to emphasize discipline. This is of utmost importance. Shanghai Pawn Shop Workers' Strike Committee.)</p>
<p>Strike Discipline: The Strike Committee formulated eight articles of strike discipline yesterday morning and posted them in front of the meeting hall: (1) Any member who is indecisive and disobeys the orders of this committee will be deprived of all due benefits. (2) If a member superficially accepts the orders of this committee but privately contacts the owners, and this is reported and verified, the member will be deprived of all due benefits. (3) Anyone who sabotages the resolution or leaks important news during the strike will be deprived of all due benefits. (4) If a member takes advantage of the strike to engage in corruption and degenerate behavior outside, the member will be severely punished by a public resolution of the general membership meeting. (5) If a member privately compromises with the owners and attempts to sabotage the strike, and this is reported and verified, the member will be permanently expelled from membership and reported to the Party Headquarters for investigation. (6) During the strike, any member who leads outsiders to mix in will be severely punished if pointed out. (7) If any member resumes work without an order from this committee to resume work, the member will be reported to the Party Headquarters for investigation. (8) These rules have been resolved and implemented by the Strike Committee of this committee.</p>
<p>Request for Protection: The Strike Committee sent a letter to the Political Department of the British and French Concessions, stating: (To the esteemed Director of the Political Department: Regarding the amendment of terms case proposed by our association to pawnshop owners, the case has been pending for four months. During this period, we have submitted requests to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to convene negotiations on several occasions, but due to the owners' resistance and refusal to comply, a reasonable solution could not be reached, which our association deeply regrets. Now, the emotions of the members are agitated to the point of being unbearable. On the 17th, a general meeting of member representatives was convened, and it was unanimously resolved that a strike is necessary to awaken the owners. Our association believes that the pawnshop industry is greatly related to the livelihoods of ordinary people and has a significant impact on social stability. Therefore, we have repeatedly considered the matter of a strike. However, the various methods of peaceful resolution that our association has hoped for over the past few months can be said to have exhausted all efforts. Under these circumstances, how can we relieve the members' plight if we do not strike? Only for the sake of prudence, we have again submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review, and we have been understood by the Municipal Party Headquarters. Therefore, it was decided by the representatives' meeting to commence the strike today (the 18th). Our association believes that many of our pawnshop member businesses are under the jurisdiction of the concession areas, and we deeply fear that your esteemed Political Department may not be clear about the facts of our association's proceedings and the true nature of the strike, and that this may lead to disputes with various police stations regarding the strike and generate misunderstandings. Therefore, we are sending a special letter to your esteemed department to earnestly declare that the members of our association are all legitimate and noble businessmen engaged in a movement to relieve their own living sufferings in a legal and orderly manner. We hope that your esteemed department will inform all police stations not to arbitrarily interfere. We are sending this letter accordingly and hope that it will be examined. Respectfully addressed to the Political Department of the General Police Station of the Public Concession, the Political Department of the General Police Station of the French Concession.)</p>
<p>Letter to Members: Dear members, we have endured for more than three months and now we can no longer endure and have implemented the strike. Although the Strike Committee has been formed, the strength of a few committee members is limited, so we still need your collective efforts to come out to help and supervise, so that the final victory will undoubtedly belong to us. For example, any private social engagements and anything unnecessary should be put aside and come to the association. This is more valuable and does not fail the responsibility of being a member. Therefore, we hope that you can all understand this and support the Strike Committee to fight together. Propaganda Department of the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Pawn Shop Workers' Association, December 18, Year 19.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Order: The Municipal Party Headquarters held a meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday to discuss and resolve the order for both labor and management to each send responsible representatives to the Party Headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 21st to negotiate a solution. The original text of the order is recorded below: (A) Order to the Pawn Shop Trade Association: (Regarding the Strict Order to Comply: The case of the dispute arising from the modification of the group agreement in the industry was previously convened for reconciliation twice by this headquarters in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau. Your association has delayed in sending representatives to attend the meeting, which is indeed playing with resistance to the law, which is highly inappropriate. Moreover, the Workers' Union has not been expressly revoked by the central government and naturally has a corresponding position in law. The Workers' Union has been filed and registered with this headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, and it should be regarded as a formal legal entity. It is also a proper procedure for it to conclude an agreement with the employer group. Your association should sincerely negotiate with it in a proper manner. However, instead of doing so, you have delayed in various ways, causing a labor strike by all workers in the industry. The cause of this is indeed due to your association, and there is no excuse. This headquarters is hereby rescheduling to convene both parties in the industry at 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month to negotiate a solution and carry out reconciliation. In addition to separately ordering the Workers' Union in the industry, we are also ordering your association to strictly comply and send four responsible representatives to the meeting on time to listen to the reconciliation. If you continue to play with resistance, you will be severely punished. You must strictly comply and not violate this order. Chen Junyi, Standing Committee Member of the People's Training Committee, printed.) (B) Order to the Pawn Shop Workers' Union: (Regarding the Order to Comply: It is hereby scheduled to reconvene both labor and management in the industry at 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month to mediate and resolve the dispute over the modification of labor-management terms. In addition to strictly ordering the Trade Association in the industry to send responsible representatives to attend, we are also ordering your association to send four responsible representatives to the meeting on time to listen to the reconciliation and comply. You must strictly comply and not violate this order. Chen Junyi, Standing Committee Member of the People's Training Committee, printed.)</p>
<p>Workers' General Meeting: Last night at 6:00 PM, workers from the five districts of East, South, West, North, and Central held a general membership meeting at the Workers' Union, attended by over 500 people. In addition to reporting various news about the strike that day, the meeting resolved: (1) The negotiation department will send negotiators to the Party Headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 21st to listen to the mediation. (2) Investigation offices will be set up in the Eastern District to facilitate broad investigation. (3) Strike special donations will be collected on a later date, in addition to the hundred or so yuan already collected. (4) Deep and earnest persuasion will be given to Baochang on Weihaiwei Road, Yihe on Gordon Road in the Central District, and Shengkang on Wusong Road in the Eastern District.</p>
<p>Owners' Meeting: The owners' Trade Association, Hu Chunsheng, and others convened a general membership meeting of all pawn shops, old and new, citywide at Beihai Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss all issues related to resolving the dispute. By 4:00 PM, only about 30 members had arrived, and the meeting was changed to a discussion session due to insufficient attendance. There was no significant outcome regarding the workers' issue, and Trade Association Chairman Chuan Zuoheng has already left Shanghai for Wuxi. Therefore, the owners will continue to treat this situation with indifference.</p>
<p>Responsibility Issue: A reporter from Riri News interviewed Tao Baichuan, a member of the People's Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters, yesterday to inquire about the Party Headquarters' attitude towards this matter and subsequent arrangements. According to him, the organization of the Pawn Shop Workers' Union is relatively sound among all workers' unions in Shanghai, and the members are not complicated. The reason for the demands made to the owners in July of this year to change the workers' treatment conditions is that the conditions stipulated by labor and management in 1927 were not implemented by most of the owners. Even those who implemented them were not in line with the current cost of living. Therefore, the workers revised the conditions previously stipulated that were too high and not implemented by the owners, hoping that the owners would also revise the conditions that were too low to suit the current cost of living of the workers. This plan was reviewed and approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters before being submitted to the owners, and the procedure can be said to be complete and legal. However, as of now, almost five months later, the owners have never sincerely contacted them for negotiations. The Social Affairs Bureau then requested the Municipal Government to mediate or submit to arbitration in accordance with the law. The Municipal Government instructed that the Workers' Union should file a lawsuit in court in accordance with the law, because the organization of the Workers' Union is the same as the organization of shop employees and is therefore not subject to mediation or arbitration under the Labor Dispute Resolution Law. In fact, it is difficult for the workers to file a lawsuit in court, and they turned to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. The Party Headquarters believes that the pawnshop industry is closely related to social finance and the lives of ordinary people, and it is the cold winter season. If a disturbance occurs, the general public will be greatly affected in terms of redeeming cotton clothes or pawning money to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, it will convene both labor and management for mediation and use appropriate methods outside the Labor Dispute Law to allow both parties to discuss and revise the agreement. However, the owners not only did not attend the negotiations but also denied the organizational structure of the Workers' Union, believing that the government had ordered the abolition of the Workers' Union. Therefore, they believe that the Pawn Shop Workers' Union is not qualified to demand modification of conditions from the owners. However, they do not know that the government has recently issued a temporary maintenance order for the Workers' Union. The Pawn Shop Workers' Union is a legitimate organizational group and has not been abolished at present. Of course, it has the qualifications to represent the workers to propose modifications to the conditions and has the effect of signing contracts. For example, any ordinary agency has the authority of its position as long as it exists for one day. It cannot be assumed that just because it is about to be abolished, its authority can be denied before it is actually abolished. Furthermore, the government has already issued a temporary maintenance order for the Workers' Union. Therefore, the owners of the pawn shops do not recognize that the Workers' Union has the authority to represent the workers and the effect of signing contracts. This is a fundamental mistake, and the focus of this labor-management dispute is that the owners deny the Workers' Union. The Municipal Party Headquarters has decided to order the owners to send responsible representatives within a limited time to listen to the mediation of the Party Headquarters. Otherwise, if the disturbance expands, all responsibility will be borne by the owners of the pawn shops. In addition, according to Guo Yongxi of the Social Affairs Bureau, who is responsible for mediating this labor dispute, the party and government agencies have come forward to mediate, but the owners have used various excuses to shirk their responsibilities, and the responsible representatives have been absent, which has led to the strike. This bureau heard about the strike news the night before last and ordered the Pawn Shop Trade Association that evening to immediately send responsible representatives to attend and listen to the mediation. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the Trade Association called and said that the association would convene a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM on the 18th and then send responsible representatives to attend and listen to the bureau's mediation. Therefore, this bureau and the People's Training Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters plan to find ways to convene labor and management for mediation to avoid prolonging this matter and causing accidents.</p>
<p>Authorities Take Precautions: The French Concession Police Department sent Detective Chen Jinbiao, and the Public Concession Police Department sent Detective Lin Chenfu to the Workers' Union to investigate and told the Workers' Union that they hoped that all actions of the workers of your association should be orderly and not go beyond the bounds to avoid misunderstandings with the police. The First District General Office of the Public Security Bureau also sent patrol officers to notify the Workers' Union and requested that all affiliated sub-offices be notified before convening meetings so that the police could be dispatched for protection.</p>
<p>Assistance from All Sides: After the strike was implemented yesterday, the Zhabei Water and Electricity, Pharmaceutical, and other labor unions sent Li Yongxiang, Fang Qingjian, and others to the Workers' Union to express their condolences and express their deep sympathy for the strike and their willingness to cooperate in economic and textual aspects. The All-City Federation of Labor Unions held an emergency meeting last night to discuss assistance for the pawn shop workers' strike, and the Pawn Shop Workers' Union also sent Lu Muqin and Cao Pinfang as representatives to request support.</p>

<p>Rice Shops Will Close for One Day on New Year's Day: The Rice Shop Trade Association previously followed the order of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to promote the Gregorian New Year's method. The retail sale of rice from rice shops is related to the livelihood of ordinary people. The number of days that the industry will close at the end and beginning of the year must be decided in advance and notified to the industry. All rice shops must indicate in front of the shop so that the rice eaters can prepare early. The association decided to follow this announcement by closing for three days for the Gregorian New Year, and it has been reported to the Municipal Government for announcement. After receiving the order, it was decided to comply with this announcement and close for three days from New Year's Day. The industry has been notified in newspapers. Reading the newspaper, it was reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce resolved to change the 15th of February to the final closing date, which is different from the previous situation. Therefore, a meeting was held again yesterday to decide that the rice shops selling rice are convenient for the poor, and it will be inconvenient for the poor to buy rice if there are too many holidays during the New Year. It was specially decided to change the holiday to one day on New Year's Day to mark the celebration. In addition to reporting to the Social Affairs Bureau, it has also notified the industry to comply.</p>

<p>No More Exclusive Rights Next Year</p>
<p>The American Evening Post reported that Peng Sen, General Manager of the Far East of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, told reporters today (the 18th) that he believes that the company and the National Government will agree on a solution to the waterline problem and sign a contract before the end of the year. The company will send representatives to Beijing in the next few days to continue discussions. He also said that the contract previously signed between the company and the Chinese government will automatically expire at the end of this year and that the company has not sought to continue its exclusive rights in the negotiations in Beijing. When asked by reporters whether the news that the Telecommunications Negotiation Committee of the Ministry of Communications would announce the old contract as invalid if a new contract had not been established by the end of the year, he replied that the old contract would automatically expire at the end of the year and there was no need to announce it as invalid. The representatives of both parties have already met many times, although there is no definite agreement yet, but it is expected that there will be no obstacles to the signing of a new contract. It is expected that the public bureau will continue to operate as usual in China after the end of the year, but it will no longer have exclusive rights.</p>

<p>Completion Is Expected in February or March Next Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration purchased a base in Zhenru to build a forensic examination institute to improve the examination system and expand forensic equipment, in order to implement examination affairs and train forensic talents. The construction project began in September of this year and has been largely completed. It is expected that it can be completed no later than February or March next spring. The construction of the institute is modeled after the Paris Forensic Examination Institute, and everything is extremely perfect, such as blood pools, sewage pools, and manure pools, all of which have disinfection methods and specific equipment. If there are doubts that it will be detrimental to hygiene or inconvenient to the neighborhood, it is because they do not understand the content and nature of the examination institute. Let alone the examination institutes of other countries, even in Shanghai, the corpse examination office on Feilun Road is located in the middle of the city, surrounded by forests of dust, and it has never been heard that it has been detrimental to hygiene. Moreover, the equipment of the Zhenru Forensic Examination Institute is newer and naturally more reassuring. As for the reason why the institute is located in Zhenru, it is said that Zhenru is a Chinese territory and not far from the city, and the road can be reached directly, and the transportation is still considered convenient.</p>

<p>The Result of the Petition Was Satisfactory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Wood Industry Association previously held a general membership meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th (the day before yesterday) to publicly elect Ge Liangqing as a representative along with all members to petition the Stamp Tax Bureau because most businesses had not affixed stamp duty to delivery notes, code notes, etc., which resulted in fines. Director Song personally received them and Ge Liangqing said that the goods in their industry were very cumbersome. Once customers arrived and identified the goods, the business would issue an invoice. However, the wood was heavy and cumbersome, and customers could not carry it or drive it home. They had to send someone to deliver it, but how could the business know whether the customer had received it? They had to rely on the deliveryman as proof that the goods had been received. If stamp duty was affixed to the delivery note and the invoice, then one item would be subject to several types of taxes, which the industry could not afford. Moreover, according to the provisional regulations on stamp duty, there was no such provision. Therefore, they led all the members to petition and asked the detainees to be released immediately and the fine order to be withdrawn. In the future, the stamp duty should be exempted for these documents. Director Song agreed to forward the request to the Second District Public Security Sub-Bureau to release the detainees and notified Committee Member Yu of the Public Security Bureau to forward it to the First District One Branch to temporarily suspend the enforcement until it was resolved. The businesses were satisfied with the reply and left.</p>
<h3 id="e91">The Issue of Adding a Time Stamp to the Liquor Industry's License <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Carriers Find It Difficult to Recognize the Strike</p>
<p>The Trade Association Decides on a Solution</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liquor Industry Association convened a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM on the 17th to discuss solutions. More than 30 members of the association, representatives of the Liquor Industry Workers' Union Hu Jian, representatives of the carriers Wu Jiliang, Cen Zizhang, Pan Chunji, Ding Shaoxing, Yu Yue Zhang Jiazhen and others, publicly elected Huang Yuming as the chairman of the meeting. As usual, representative of the Liquor Industry Workers' Union Hu Jian reported the sentiment of the carriers' anger, thinking that the carriers' strike was based on their own interests and was completely automatic. Even if it was suppressed, representative of the carriers Wu Jiliang reported the difficulties of adding a time stamp to the license from the carriers' point of view: (A) When the carriers picked up the liquor and went out, they might meet relatives and friends on the road. If the license had a stamp of a few o'clock and a few minutes, and the conversation lasted a little longer, the time would pass. If the inspectors of the Baijiu Tax Bureau encountered it, they would think that it was illegal and detain them and impose a penalty. The carriers would not be able to recognize the fine, and the carriers would suffer losses. (B) If the carriers picked up the liquor and went out and encountered rain or disaster, they might rest for a while. If they passed the time, the inspectors of the Baijiu Tax Bureau would think that they had violated the time rules and impose a penalty. (C) If the carriers picked up the liquor and went out and had to go to the bathroom or encountered traffic lights or other things, the inspectors of the bureau would think that they had violated the time rules. The carriers would be fined too much. The carriers were hardworking workers who walked with shoulder poles to earn some money. The bureau's regulations were cruel and deliberately oppressed the carriers, so the carriers could not recognize them. The carriers had indeed decided that if this matter was not resolved satisfactorily, the carriers would not be able to resume work. The discussion then began: (1) Regarding the case where the Liquor Tax Bureau sent a letter notifying that a time stamp must be added to the license when the liquor was taken out, it was resolved that adding a time stamp to the license was not in line with the spirit of the law or commercial customs. Furthermore, the carriers had stopped working due to various difficulties, so they could not recognize it. (2) Regarding the case where the Liquor Industry Workers' Union sent a letter conveying the five preliminary measures to the carriers after they stopped working and requested negotiations with the Baijiu Tax Bureau, it was resolved to send the letter to the Baijiu Tax Bureau and ask them to reply immediately in order to promote the carriers' resumption of work and benefit business. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>Speech at the Welcome Reception of the Sino-French University's School of Pharmacy</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 17th), all the students of the Sino-French University's School of Pharmacy held a meeting to welcome their senior alumnus, Mr. Chu Minyi. Besides Mr. Chu, present were the university's Dean of Academic Affairs, Professor Song Wusheng, Professors Jardel and Ji Ying, and all the students, gathered together in great enthusiasm. First, the chairman delivered a welcoming speech, roughly stating that there were two meanings to welcoming Principal Chu today: (1) Senior Alumnus Chu represents China and has won third place at the Belgian Exposition, adding much glory to the country. (2) It is hoped that Principal Chu will expand this school to ensure its extremely satisfactory development, etc. Then, Mr. Chu delivered a speech, the text of which is recorded as follows: To run a pharmacy school, one must first have complete and sound equipment. We have long considered this point. However, magnificent school buildings cannot be built in a day, and the establishment of the pharmacy school cannot be delayed. Weighing the importance, we first established the school and then gradually sought to improve it. This is why this school was established in the shortest possible time. Chinese pharmacy is like a treasure trove waiting to be unearthed. Unfortunately, the Chinese people have not paid attention to it, thinking that learning pharmacy means going to a pharmacy to pour tea and sweep the floor, muddling through three years of apprenticeship, and then being able to learn and apply it. It seems that there is no need for a school to specialize in the study of pharmacy. This is not only the view of ordinary people, but also of the education authorities. The university organization law stipulated by the Ministry of Education lists pharmacy as a Category D subject, and the name can only be called a specialized course or a pharmacy department of a certain college. The length of study is only two or three years. The neglect of pharmacy is evident. Our school is set for four years plus one year of internship. It is not deliberately extending the time limit in violation of the school system, but because it is factually necessary. Europe, America and Japan study pharmacy very seriously. China is rich in medicinal products all over the world, but unfortunately the Chinese people are unwilling to explore with scientific methods, which leads to backwardness. Not only pharmacy, but everything in China is inferior to other countries. Even in terms of international status, China has been reduced to a semi-colonial status. Looking at the entire China, because military, political and economic power are inferior to others, and observing the individual Chinese people, physical education, knowledge and skills are also inferior to others. Therefore, to maintain the nation, we must first promote physical education, to promote civil rights, we must first popularize education, and to realize people's livelihood, we must first encourage skills. The purpose of participating in the Belgian Exposition this time is to promote domestic products and encourage skills, just like participating in the Far Eastern Games to promote physical education. The honor that the Chinese people have obtained at the Belgian Exposition this time should not be complacent. Similarly, the failure of the previous Far Eastern Games should not be discouraged. I have seen that Italy participated in the Belgian Exposition and displayed a locomotive marked with a speed of 75 kilometers per hour, which is one of the country's fine products. Although this is laughable, its sincere attitude in showing the progress of the country's industrial skills does not violate the purpose of the competition, and it is admirable. Chinese skills are far inferior to others, and pharmacy is one of the skills, which is as important as industry and medicine. Therefore, to cultivate sound talents, it is necessary to establish a pharmacy university with complete equipment like those in Europe, America or Japan, which is not the same as literature and law, which are only learned from books. Finally, the Dean of Academic Affairs and Professor Jardel gave speeches, the length of which is omitted.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Zhejiang Industrial Bank Resolution <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Passes Resolution to Replenish Unpaid Capital and Increase Public Reserve Fund</p>
<p>In order to further consolidate its foundation, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was convened on the 3rd of this month by the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Li Fuqing, to pass a resolution to replenish the unpaid capital and increase the public reserve fund. The resolutions are recorded as follows: The bank's business is developing day by day. On the eighteenth [year], the assets and liabilities amounted to 40,011,628.03 yuan, while the total capital was only 2 million yuan, of which 200,000 yuan was unpaid, and the public reserve fund was 1 million yuan, totaling less than 3 million yuan. Although the value of the property has been reduced and the accumulated assets are abundant, the external figures are not enough to meet the expectations of the society. The bank has business dealings with major foreign banks, which not only have huge capital, but also have public reserves that often exceed their capital. In comparison, it is inevitably excessive. Especially after the gold-expensive and silver-cheap situation, the board of directors carefully considered that if the capital is increased, the shareholders' capital may not be sufficient, and the recruitment of new shares may harm the interests of the shareholders, and the bank will increase the burden of dividends, which seems unnecessary. After checking the valuable securities held by the bank over the years, most of them are gold coin bonds. Recently, the bond price and gold price have both increased, and the difference compared with the book price is huge. It is now proposed that, except for the savings department, the original exchange rate of various British gold and US gold bonds purchased by the bank be appropriately revised, and the excess amount and the retained earnings over the years be used to replenish the unpaid capital and increase the public reserve fund so that the current public reserve amount is equal to the total capital. The revised exchange rate is still only 75% of the market price, which is enough for future exchange rate changes. If the total of the ticket price and the gold price is still less than 30% of the market price, the general method is listed as follows: (1) The excess amount of the appropriately revised gold coin bond exchange rate and the retained earnings over the years total 1.1 million yuan, which is allocated as follows: A. 200,000 yuan is used to replenish the total capital. B. 900,000 yuan is received as public reserve fund. The public reserve fund extracted before and throughout the 19th year totals 2 million yuan, and the extraction will continue according to the regulations in each subsequent final settlement. (2) The new shares of 200,000 yuan to replenish the total capital are distributed to shareholders, directors and supervisors.

<h3 id="e101">Key Points of Anti-Drug Group Propaganda <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Anti-Drug Association Formulated in Earnest</p>
<p>The China National Anti-Drug Association has published a book entitled "Outline of the Organization of a Local Anti-Drug Group" for the purpose of unifying the names and organizations of local anti-drug groups. Local anti-drug groups are divided into two types: anti-drug branch associations and anti-drug propaganda associations. Except for the provincial capitals, cities, ports, and important overseas regions where the association designates personnel to contact local important groups and enthusiastic people to organize anti-drug branch associations, anti-drug propaganda associations are set up in all other counties, which are organized by local enthusiastic groups or individuals in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the association. At present, there are a large number of propaganda associations being organized. In order to promote the work of these propaganda associations, the China National Anti-Drug Association has specially formulated an outline of propaganda methods as follows: (1) Anti-drug speeches (2) Screening of anti-drug films and slides (3) Posting of pictures and slogans (4) Writing propaganda articles and contacting opinion circles to publish more anti-drug speeches (5) Investigating local drug conditions and reporting to the investigation section of the China National Anti-Drug Association (6) Holding student anti-drug speech contests (7) Holding student anti-drug essay contests (8) Promoting the Anti-Drug Monthly and other anti-drug books, slides, exhibitions, etc. The association has detailed the above-mentioned items and the steps to be taken. In addition, it has also formulated a kind of anti-drug propaganda calendar for the use of anti-drug groups in various places, which will be implemented from next year. It has been notified to propaganda associations in various places to handle it according to their ability and report the results at any time for assessment. It is said that a book of the organization outline can be sent by mail with a four-cent stamp to the association.</p>

<p>Lu Shaotang Kidnapped</p>
<p>Kidnappers Pre-Planned</p>
<p>Four Shots Fired, Bodyguard Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang Dragged Away by Bandits</p>
<p>Bloodstains Conspicuous in the Car</p>
<p>At half past six yesterday afternoon, a kidnapping occurred at the corner of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, where four bandits kidnapped real estate tycoon Lu Shaotang. The bandits opened fire and killed a Russian bodyguard, and then dragged Lu out of the car and sped away. The investigation results are recorded below.</p>
<p>Lu Shaotang, a Suzhou native who was once kidnapped,</p>
<p>Also known as Jingjian, is 63 years old and lives at 235 Daqing Lane, Jiujiang Road. He set up the Guixing Real Estate Company at 282 Shanxi Road and specializes in real estate. He is known as the Real Estate Tycoon of Shanghai. He has a wife and children at home. He hired Xu Jianping and owned a luxurious sedan, registration number 1015 in the concession and 406 in the Chinese area. He hired two Russian bodyguards to accompany him in and out. It is heard that he spent a lot of money to redeem himself last year after being kidnapped, so he used Russian bodyguards to strengthen his courage.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he went to a friend's appointment. At about 6 p.m. yesterday, Lu was invited by a Shao friend in Xujiahui to celebrate his birthday, so he left his Guixing Company at 282 Shanxi Road and took his own car east to west on Tianjin Road. There was a Russian bodyguard in the car, intending to invite his wife to go with him. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, there was a motorized bicycle in front of him that was driving, but the speed was very slow. Lu's driver, Lu Chunsheng, was very angry when he saw this and pressed the horn to warn him, but the person driving the motorcycle ignored him as if he was deliberately looking for trouble.</p>
<p>The kidnappers opened fire and kidnapped people. Lu's car was about to turn around and move forward when suddenly four people, all dressed in blue cloth short shirts and holding handguns, shouted "Drive slowly." The Russian bodyguard saw that the situation was not good and was about to draw his gun to fight back, but a bullet flew in from the right and pierced the glass window, hitting the Russian in the chest. He still wanted to fight back with force, but the bandits' bullets came again and penetrated the iron plate of the car body. The bandits immediately jumped into the car and dragged Lu into a covered car parked next to the Yongping Laundry door. At this time, the driver, Lu Chunsheng, was stunned and unable to do anything. The bandits saw that their plan had succeeded and became evil again, firing two shots into Lu's car. The glass window shattered and the Russian was wounded by gunshots. The cushions were covered in blood, which was very tragic.</p>
<p>The Russian died in the line of duty. After seeing his master being kidnapped, the driver got out of the car and tried to chase after him, but the kidnappers' car drove south very quickly. He only saw that the number of the car seemed to be 10421, but it is not yet certain. At the same time, a Chinese patrol officer came forward to report to the Laozha Police Station to request the arrest. On the one hand, the Russian bodyguard's car was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but he died due to his injuries. He was then sent to the Feilun Road mortuary to await the coroner's report today.</p>

<p>The First Unit Was Launched the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Test Results Were Excellent</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has been experiencing rapid business development recently, and the original locomotives are not enough to distribute. It has ordered eight of the latest invented Pacific-style locomotives from the American Great Northern Company, worth 2 million silver dollars. Four of them have been shipped to China and assembled at the Songnan Zhanghuabang Main Factory. The first unit was launched the day before yesterday and the test results were quite good. The assembly of the second unit is also about to be completed and it will be put into trial use within a few days. According to a mechanic from the factory, the new locomotives are not only new in style and fast in speed, but also long and large. The diameter of the internal and external steam pipes is 28 inches, so the towing force is as high as 2,700 tons. The towing force of the old locomotives on the line is only 1,500 to 1,600 tons, which can be called the crown of domestic locomotives. Only the two locomotives on the former Longhai Railway can tow 2,400 tons each, which were called the first. If the new locomotives are placed in the north, they can climb mountains and cross ridges, so they are also called climbing cars. The car does not need manual coal loading because there is a small machine inside. The coal is added to the small machine from the upper opening. The small machine rotates and the coal is crushed into small pieces. It is sprayed into the furnace for burning from the middle machine opening. After burning, the coal ash is dumped from the lower end. One machine is used for three purposes, which is the best way to save labor, etc.</p>

<p>Pig Trade Partners Out Collecting Accounts</p>
<p>Gangsters Block the Road and Rob</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Wounds Young Boy Named Gu</p>
<p>Patrol Police Chase and Capture One Thief</p>
<p>At about 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a robbery with gunfire occurred at the intersection of Caishen Lane on Nantao Santai Wharf Road. The police from the First Section of the First District captured one thief on the spot and recovered a 6-inch Browning pistol with live ammunition. The car driver of the victim is highly suspected and has been detained for interrogation. The details of the case are recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Two Groups Depart to Collect Accounts. Changhe Pig Trade, located at No. 2 Peide Lane, 16th Pu, Nantao, has been open for many years and has been developing well. After lunch yesterday, the store sent two runners, Wang Bingzhao and Fan Xianting, both from Ningbo, to take two rented cars to collect accounts from various customers. At about 2:00 p.m., they had collected a total of more than 600 yuan, which was all hidden in a money bag and placed in the car of Wang. They were about to return to the store when they suddenly encountered four luxuriously dressed bandits blocking their cars at the intersection of Caishen Lane on Nantao Santai Wharf Road and forcing them to stop.</p>
<p>Returning Home, They Encounter Bandits. One of the bandits showed a handgun to scare them into silence. Another bandit slapped Wang on the face twice and pushed his car over with force. Wang fell out of the car and onto the ground. The bandits then grabbed the money bag containing the accounts from the car and fled. Before leaving, they fired a shot. Gu Yongquan, a Wuxi boatman, 34 years old, who lived at No. 10 Xinjie, was the father of a six year old son, Hailun. Hailun was playing outside the Fuxing Teahouse near his home after lunch when one of the bandits fired and a bullet hit Hailun in the buttocks.</p>
<p>Stray Bullet Injures Child. Hailun was in pain and slapped his hips, forcing the bullet out of the wound. Immediately blood poured out of him. His father Gu Yongquan heard and rushed to carry him to the hospital. After the robbers left, Wang Bingzhao was helped up by the driver, who had recovered from the shock. They hastily took the car back to report the circumstances of the robbery.</p>
<p>Police Search Suspiciously. The bandits escaped to the vicinity of Qinglong Bridge. Duan Jingming, the guard of the 31st post, noticed that their expressions were panicked. One of them put a money bag into his pocket, which was suspicious. He immediately detained him and was about to search him when a man wearing a new blue silk robe said to Duan, "We're all countrymen, don't search." Duan refused, and the man suddenly showed his handgun.</p>
<p>Passersby Shout, "Catch the Thief!" Duan police felt he could not resist. The suspects then split up and fled. Duan police then chased after the bandit with the gun. The bandit knew that someone was chasing him, so he fired a shot behind him. Fortunately, the shot missed. When he escaped to the Shengxian Bridge outside the Small South Gate, the thief threw the gun aside. Passersby shouted about the robbery. The alarm made its way to Police Chief Ma Yuqin and He Desheng from the First Section of the First District, who immediately rushed to coordinate the arrest.</p>
<p>As a result, he was intercepted and captured at the northern end of Cangqiao near the Qiaopi Alley, and the abandoned handgun was found nearby. He was taken back to the police station, where Field Director Tian interrogated him. The thief confessed that his name was Yang Xin, 32 years old, from Shandong, and that he lived at No. 15 Tianshou Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, at the Letian Teahouse in the Public Concession, he met a man named Dakuaitou and two Jiangbei people. Dakuaitou asked me to go to Nanma Wharf today to split some spoils with a man in a car.</p>
<p>Bandit's Confession. He said that he had agreed with the driver. Today, at about 1:00 p.m., he met with them at the teahouse and came here to do the job. He did not expect to be captured. He also said that all the men lived in Tanzhiwan, Zhabei, and that the handgun belonged to Dakuaitou. As the case involved daytime robbery and injury with gunfire, the case was ordered to be detained for investigation. Afterwards, District Leader Dong Mingde learned about the incident and took detective Yuan Haishan and others to the address to detain the driver of the car, Jiang Jingru, from Rugao, and brought him back for questioning. Jiang repeatedly denied it and was temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Extortionists Still Unafraid of the Law <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Masterminds Have Already Been Arrested</p>
<p>The Bandits Dare to Extort a Second Time</p>
<p>Detectives Go to Arrest Them, But They Are Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>Zhang and Chen, the Two Bandits, Scheduled for Judgment</p>
<p>Extortionists Chen Liansheng and Zhang Jinfu repeatedly sent letters to Zhang Muhan, a runner for the Kangyuan Printing and Can Manufacturing Factory on Jiangxi Road, demanding 60,000 yuan. They were arrested and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details of the case have been reported in the previous news. It is now learned that the accomplices of the two bandits, unaware that the masterminds had been arrested, did not repent. On the 15th of this month, they sent another letter to Zhang Muhan, stating that their brothers Zhang and Chen had been detained and that he should quickly send 200 yuan to the paper basket next to the telephone pole across from the Puyi Workhouse near the Nanto Local Hall, otherwise his life would be in danger. Zhang sent the letter to the Hongkou Police Station. Because the appointment was for the afternoon of that day, the chief of police sent detectives to guard the area until dark, but they found nothing. It was also heard that Zhang and others had a handgun, which was either hidden at No. 102 Fengdeng Road, Zhabei, or at No. 5 Pingliang Road. Chinese and Western detectives were sent to search both locations, but they were not found. It is believed that they have been moved by their accomplices to other locations. This morning, Special Court Judge Ge ordered the two bandits to be brought to court for further interrogation. Zhang's lawyer, Fan Gang, argued that such cases have become more common recently and have a great impact on public security, requesting that they be severely punished to curb the banditry. Zhang Xingfa confessed that the case was initiated by Miao Laosan. Miao knew Zhang's maid and told me to get to know her. Then I attached the invitation with a letter and had her deliver it to Zhang's maid. Then I asked Chen to help, etc. Chen confessed that Zhang invited me to help when I was a foreman at the Zhentai Yarn Factory. I advised him not to do such a dangerous thing, but he did not listen and said that he would definitely get the money, so I went with him. I was really fooled by him. After the interrogation, Judge Ge ordered the two bandits to be remanded in custody pending sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Continued Trial of a Large Group of Notorious Robbers <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Prostitute Miao Xianglou and others Brought to Court</p>
<p>Describing the Circumstances of the Robbery at the Time</p>
<p>Detectives Lu Liankui and Liu Shaokui from the General Inspectorate of the General Police Department, along with Detective Wang Chengying, apprehended a large group of notorious robbers, including Dong Yushu, totaling thirty-one men and women. They confiscated firearms and ammunition and discovered that Dong and his gang were involved in six robbery cases and one kidnapping case. They were escorted to the Special Court for interrogation and detention. As reported in this newspaper yesterday afternoon, Wu Tingqi presided over the three courts of the Ministry of Justice for continued questioning. First, they examined the case of the robbery of prostitutes Miao Fenglou and Xiangfei. The seven defendants involved in this case are Dong Yushu, Yu Ansheng, Wang Fusheng, Shen Xingda, Shen Yonglin, Xia Jintang, and Zhang Rongfu. Therefore, the police department brought these seven criminals to court. Wang Yaotang, the police department's lawyer, stated the case, saying that after the defendants were arrested, Dong Yushu confessed to the robbery and led the detectives to a pawnshop at 67 Lloyd Road, where they recovered two stolen watches. Subsequently, the two plaintiffs were summoned to the police department to identify the suspects and recognized Dong Yushu, Wang Fusheng, and Zhang Rongxiang as being present at the scene. However, the two plaintiffs did not report the robbery to the police department after it occurred. Miao Fenglou, claiming to be sixteen years old and working as a prostitute in Xin Hui Le Li Shu Yu for many years, testified that at 11 p.m. on October 21st, she received a call from a customer named Gong, requesting her to go to room 314 of the New World Hotel. As soon as she entered the room, she was surrounded by three or four people who threatened her with guns, drove her into the bathroom, and forced her to lower her head. They stole her watch, a coat, and a fake diamond ring (bought from the New Xin Company for one yuan when going abroad). They locked the bathroom door and left. Half an hour later, she opened the door and went back, but due to being too frightened, she fell down the stairs from the third floor. She could not recognize the faces of the robbers, but she thought Wang Fusheng seemed to be the one guarding the bathroom door at the time. She also identified a watch that the police department recovered as hers. The prostitute Xiangfei testified that she was eighteen years old. That night, she received a call from a customer named Gong to go to room 314 of the New World Hotel, where she was locked in the bathroom. She saw that Miao Fenglou was already there. Her coat, a cape, a watch, and a ring were stolen. She pointed out Dong Yushu, Wang Fusheng, and Zhang Rongfu as being present at the scene. Dong Yushu, when questioned, said that he met someone named Jin on Ni Cheng Bridge and was invited to room 314 of the New World Hotel. He also saw Wang Fusheng, Zhang Rongfu, Jin, and Xia playing mahjong. Because the mahjong game did not start, they initiated a call for prostitutes. He then called for the prostitute Clees and Jin called for Xiangfei. After the call was sent, he left. Around 12 o'clock, Xia and others came and told him about robbing the prostitutes. Only then did he know. He knew nothing else. Yu Ansheng, Shen Xingda, Shen Yonglin, and Sun Chansheng all denied being involved in the robbery. Wang Fusheng said that he was invited by Xia Jin and Dong to the hotel to play. After he took a bath, he saw Jin and Dong each writing a call for a prostitute. At that time, he went outside and did not know what happened afterward. Zhang Rongfu admitted being present at the scene, but he had left when the robbery occurred. The questioning for this case was completed. The interrogation then moved to the robbery cases at 370 San Tai Road, 103 Da Tong Road, etc. until late at night. Judge Wu ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody separately for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>The case of registration of divination and astrology in this city was previously drafted by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation, limiting the deadline to the end of July of this year, requiring all practitioners to change their profession.

Coincidentally, a fellow villager named Shao Afa, about twenty-six years old, whose wife had come to Shanghai last year to work as a servant in a brothel, took advantage of Jin's boat arriving in Shanghai on the 13th of this month and docking near the sampan factory in the Suzhou Creek, Shao searched everywhere for his wife but could not find her. Later, he met a fellow villager who said that he had seen Shao's wife in March and that she had eloped with someone. Shao was extremely worried after hearing this. On the evening of the day before yesterday, as Jin's boat was about to return to his hometown, he went ashore to buy supplies. When he returned to the boat, he suddenly saw Shao lying drunk in the hold. He called out to Shao, but Shao did not respond. He saw a cigarette case beside Shao and knew that he had taken poison to end his life. Jin was extremely anxious but had no money to call a doctor. With the help of the neighboring boatmen, he poured a large basin of soapy water into Shao's mouth. Although Shao vomited a little, he did not wake up. Jin, knowing that Shao's life was in danger and that he would not be able to take care of Shao's body in Shanghai if anything happened, immediately set sail and returned to his hometown that night.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Chen and Huang, Who Collected Money Under the Guise of a School, Were Separately Detained and Warned <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yongshui collected money under the guise of a school. He rented two rooms upstairs at 275 Zhejiang Road to open a Xin Xin Free Night School and advertised for students, saying that they could graduate in six months and be able to speak English, charging only one yuan for paper fees. After the classes started, he suddenly wanted to collect tuition fees of one yuan per month. The students, thinking that the Meilun Night School next door had lower fees, planned to transfer. Chen, along with his accountant Huang Bingqing and a Westerner, impersonated government officials, accusing the students of holding secret meetings to plot rebellion and forcibly conducted inspections. Afterward, the students went to the police station to complain. Except for the Westerner who escaped, Chen and Huang were detained and sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. As reported in the previous newspaper, yesterday morning was the date for sentencing in this case. The police escorted the two defendants, Chen and Huang, to the court. Judge Luo Renji proposed the case and questioned their names. He then immediately sentenced Chen Yongshui to two months of imprisonment and Huang Bingrong to one month of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Liu Xiaoheng's Case of Suing for Guaranteed Salary <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Shen Guansong Appealed Against the Original Judgment</p>
<p>The Hearing Concluded Yesterday, and the Judgment Will Be Announced on a Set Date</p>
<p>The actor Liu Xiaoheng, Shen Guansong and Chang Yunheng jointly opened the Shanghai Stage Theater with a capital of 30,000 yuan. Shen occupied half of the shares and served as the front desk manager. Liu and Chang each occupied half of the remaining half, each contributing 7,500 yuan. Chang served as the backstage manager, and Liu worked at the theater with a guaranteed monthly salary of 2,500 yuan. Before the opening, one month's salary was paid in advance. After the business started, due to the lack of patrons, the actors' salaries could not be paid monthly until the theater closed. Liu was owed the most, totaling more than 7,000 yuan. Shen, as the front desk manager, held the financial power. Therefore, Liu demanded the salary from Shen, but Shen argued that Liu was also a shareholder. When the business declined, he had stated that the guaranteed salary must be discounted. According to his calculations, there were no outstanding payments, and he firmly refused Liu's request. Liu then filed a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court, presenting the receipt for the first month's salary as proof of the amount he should receive. As a result, Liu won the case. However, Shen was not satisfied and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, the Jiangsu Higher Branch Court opened the hearing and summoned both parties and Chang Yunheng. Liu and Shen each presented their arguments. The court then questioned Chang Yunheng, who stated that the actors' guaranteed salaries were determined by the backstage manager and informed to the front desk manager for payment. Although there was no written contract, there was a salary ledger for reference. This ledger was managed by the accountant of the front desk manager and could be easily checked. The court, based on Chang's testimony, questioned Shen Guansong. Shen initially said that there were only written notes of the salary amount, but then admitted that there was indeed a ledger still stored in the Shanghai Stage accounting room. Judge Hu immediately ordered the bailiffs to go and retrieve it. However, the theater had now been reorganized into the Tianchan Theater, and the previous owner had completely taken away all the previous items. How could a business's lifeline still be left in its original location? The bailiffs returned empty-handed. Judge Hu then asked Shen where the ledger was, but Shen passed the blame to the accountant. Therefore, the ledger could not be retrieved. The lawyers for both sides then debated, and the judge announced that the judgment would be announced on a set date.</p>

<p>Poor People's Shelters Open Simultaneously</p>
<p>Wang Yiting and Huang Hanzhi, chairmen of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation, have been holding temporary poor people's shelters in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas every winter for years. The shelters provide the poor with food, clothing, education, and care. When spring warms up, they send them back to their hometowns or give them funds to start a business, send them to work-study schools to learn a trade, or send them to nursing homes. They do their best to suit their circumstances. It is said that the north and south shelters have been agreed to open simultaneously on the 20th of this month. In the Zhabei area, Luo Xingyou, Guo Rongzong, Fang Lan, and others have been urgently preparing under the direction of Wang Binyan, Weng Yinchu, and Wang Junsheng, to ensure that the shelters open on time and meet the public's expectations.</p>

<p>The Verdict in the Embezzlement Case is Announced</p>
<p>The manager of a customs brokerage firm, Huang Zhendong, previously hired lawyer Bahe to sue his partner, Yu Jiahao, in the criminal court of the French Concession for embezzling over 130,000 taels, requesting an investigation. The case was brought up again yesterday for questioning. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant was responsible for customs declarations in the plaintiff's firm. Unexpectedly, the defendant colluded with Chen and Zhao Zhongkang, who are at large, to commit fraud and evade taxes. The plaintiff discovered this and interrogated Yu Jiahao, who admitted his guilt and provided a written confession. However, his accomplices, Chen and Zhao Zhongkang, are still at large. The lawyer requested permission to publish photos of Zhao and Chen in the newspapers for their arrest and prosecution. The defendant, Yu Jiahao, also hired a lawyer to defend himself, stating that Yu Jiahao was an employee of the plaintiff's firm and was only responsible for customs declarations, but the money was managed by others. Moreover, the customs organization is strict, so how could he commit fraud? As for the written confession provided by the defendant, it was obtained under duress and cannot be legally recognized. The plaintiff must provide additional evidence to be valid. Judge Zhu announced that the debate was concluded and that the verdict would be announced after review. The request to publish the arrest warrants for Chen and Zhao was temporarily delayed at the plaintiff's request.</p>

<p>The Changxing Coal Mine Company held a shareholders' meeting at the Ping An Hotel in the French Concession at 2 p.m. yesterday (the 18th) to request the government to return the mining rights. Over forty shareholders attended, including Lu Bohong, Liu Shisun, Zhu Zhiyao, Liu Wanqing, Yi Zhizhen, Ming Runshen, Han Zude, Liu Zhixiang, Zhu Huanwen, Ye Danian, and Yu Shuchun. Ming Runshen was elected as the temporary chairman. First, Director Liu Wanqing reported on the efforts to reclaim the mining rights and described the Changxing mining area being taken over and managed by the Free Construction Committee for three years. Despite repeated efforts, the mining rights have not been returned. Now, Chairman Jiang believes that the government's recovery of privately-owned electricity and mining enterprises was a miscalculation. In the future, we must find ways to reward and protect private industries. Today's meeting hopes that all shareholders will unite and continue to strive for reclamation. Then, Lu Bohong and Yi Nanzhen proposed to organize a shareholders' committee of the Changxing Coal Mine Company to request the return of the mining rights. It was decided to appoint directors Liu Wanqing, Yi Nanzhen, Lu Bohong, and Liu Zhixiang, supervisors Ming Runshen, and shareholders Han Zude, Ye Danian, and Yu Shuchun as members of the committee and jointly negotiate with the banking consortium to reason with the government.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the esteemed chief editor: Having read the news item in your esteemed newspaper of the 9th of this month, under the local news column, entitled "(Comprador of the Gonghe Steamer Expels Workers Ashore)," many of the statements are far from the truth and completely contrary to the facts. Upon investigation, the Gonghe Steamer originally had only eighty workers. Later, due to frequent changes of the business director, the number of workers being brought on increased daily, eventually reaching as many as one hundred and twenty. Gradually, disputes arose over who should stay and who should go, leading to labor-management conflicts. On April 26th of this year, the Shanghai Seamen's Union sent representatives to mediate with the former director, and a mediation agreement was successfully reached. Item B of the agreement stated: "(The business director acknowledges that there were originally seventy-eight workers and two workers who faced difficulties. The remaining workers are subject to the director's discretion regarding who stays and who goes.)" Now that the director has already left the position, the workers employed by the director should naturally leave with them, departing the ship immediately to clear the handover. This is the proper procedure. Unexpectedly, thirty-eight of the tea room staff, failing to understand the situation, insisted on staying on the ship, holding onto their positions and intending to overturn the previous agreement. To protect the business and uphold the established rules, I had no choice but to negotiate with the former director. The former director then gently persuaded the workers, urging them to leave the ship temporarily while arrangements were made to settle them elsewhere. Contrary to expectations, these individuals spoke in harsh tones and refused to listen to the advice, leading to a conflict. Later, the tea room staff petitioned me, stating that their procedures at various ports were not yet cleared, requesting permission to disembark in Shanghai after their shift. Considering their hardship, I granted their request. This was the actual situation at the time. How could they claim to have been expelled by the crowd, which is utterly false? If they had been expelled by the crowd, why would they still be allowed to remain on the ship, working as usual? Moreover, the negotiation of this matter took place on the evening of the 5th. Afterwards, the ship immediately set sail. The workers then went to Hankou with the ship. How could they all go to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition the next day? The claim that "all" went to the bureau is also a fabrication to alarm and deceive the government. It is evident that they are using any means necessary. In short, these workers are completely unknown to me, and I have no guarantee of employing them. Who would dare to take responsibility on their behalf? Furthermore, they are purely private individuals employed by the former director and are not members of the Seamen's Union. The dispute over who should stay and who should go belongs to the former director, so I have no basis to mediate, let alone expel them. This is a deliberate attempt to mislead the public and slander me. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, requesting them to uphold fairness and order them to leave the ship according to regulations, I am also writing to your esteemed newspaper to request a correction to clarify the truth and align with the facts. This is my sincere prayer. Respectfully, Shen Yijing, Business Director of the Gonghe Steamer. December 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e133">China Child Welfare Association <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Report on Child Health Facilities</p>
<p>Child welfare is still in its infancy in our country. In Europe and America, it has been well established, encompassing all aspects, not just the education and upbringing of orphans and the relief of child victims of disasters. Since its inception, our association has been actively pursuing all matters related to children's welfare, such as protection, education, upbringing, health, and research, all proceeding in parallel. We now present to the readers a report on the association's child health facilities, hoping to receive your valuable guidance. Today's children are the future citizens. There has never been a strong nation built by weak children, nor can child health be achieved without comprehensive hygiene. Therefore, the health of the nation is closely related to child health. Recognizing this, the association has established a Child Health Department, inviting child health experts in Shanghai to form a committee. The chairman is Dr. Fu Wenshou, a pediatrician. The committee members include Dr. Hu Xuanming, Dr. Niu Huisheng, Mrs. Chuan Bulan, Ms. Yin Cuie, Ms. Shi Meiyu, Dr. Huang Bingji, and Dr. Wang Shuzhen. They are dedicated to discussing child health facilities. In terms of promotion, they edit articles for publication in the association's monthly magazine, "Child Welfare," and also print pamphlets and forms for widespread distribution. In June of this year, a health campaign was held in Zhabei, including exhibitions, lectures, parades, cholera vaccinations, promotion of children's bathing, physical examinations of children, and treatment of children's diseases, as well as the screening of lantern slides and movies. This campaign received the deep sympathy and assistance of all sectors, resulting in outstanding achievements. Statistics show that over 3,000 people attended the opening ceremony to listen to speeches by prominent figures, about 40,000 people visited the exhibitions and movies, over 1,000 people participated in the parade, 88 people received physical examinations, 1,166 people received cholera vaccinations, and 200 people received expanded medical treatment and model baths. This campaign greatly increased the health awareness of people in the Zhabei area, who previously knew nothing about hygiene, and promoted overall health. All of this is thanks to the generosity of various benefactors, for which the association is deeply grateful. In terms of implementation, due to limited resources, we first planned to establish four child health clinics in Shanghai, located in the Zhabei, Yangshupu, Caojiadu, and Pudong districts. This is because these four districts have a high concentration of workers and a large number of poor people, most of whom are ignorant and unaware of hygiene, neglecting their children, leaving them with dirty faces, unwashed limbs, irregular meals, and inadequate clothing. Some parents neglect their children's illnesses and lack the means to seek treatment, allowing them to die without care. The association's plan to establish child health clinics is based on the above situation, aiming to remedy it. On the one hand, experienced nurses are sent to various families to instill health knowledge, enabling ignorant residents to realize the importance of hygiene in protecting the health of their children. On the other hand, pediatricians in Shanghai are hired to provide diagnosis and medication, so that children who are sick but lack the means to seek medical treatment can receive care. The child health clinics that have already been established include the one in Zhabei District, located on Xiqiujiang Road. Since its opening in August of the 18th year of the Republic, it has treated a total of 10,349 children for diseases and has promoted hygiene in 1,196 families. The one in Yangshupu District, located on Linqing Road, has, since its opening in June of this year, treated a total of 4,297 children for diseases and has promoted hygiene in 350 families. The two that have not yet been established are in Caojiadu and Pudong. Once funding is available, they will be implemented immediately. We earnestly hope that child welfare enthusiasts at home and abroad will rise up and assist us, so that there will be child health facilities throughout the country. This will not only be the fortune of children across the country, but also the fortune of China's future.</p>

<h3 id="e134">General Assembly of the Fudan University Journalism Department <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>By Bing Ye</p>
<p>Nine Executive Committee Members Elected for the Next Term</p>
<p>Specific Plan for the Research Office Approved</p>
<p>The Journalism Department of Fudan University is considered the most famous department among domestic universities. Its status and reputation are increasing day by day. This is certainly not a false reputation. We only need to look at its remarkable achievements to understand. Not to mention anything else, the graduates of this Journalism Department in each term all hold important positions in today's society and are respected by people from all walks of life. Especially in domestic newspapers, when scholars with in-depth research in journalism are needed, graduates of this department are certainly highly valued. All of this is due to the enthusiastic guidance of Director Xie Liuyi and Professors Huang Tianpeng, Qian Bohan, and Guo Butao. At the same time, it is also because the students of this department are more united and possess a true spirit of doing things than other departments. For example, Wang Deliang, the editor-in-chief of the Fudan News Agency, and Du Shaowen, the editor of the Fudan Five-Day Journal, are both vigorous forces who sacrifice themselves to serve the entire Fudan University enthusiastically. All of these are facts before our eyes that no one can deny. In general, whatever is achieved today is the result of past efforts, which is understandable to most people.</p>
<p>With the end-of-term exams approaching, the Journalism Department is, of course, handling the end of the semester according to the regulations of Fudan University. Because of this, Du Shaowen, the head of general affairs of the department, convened a general assembly the afternoon before yesterday at 3:00 PM, which was also the last assembly of the Journalism Department for this semester. More than 50 people attended, with almost all students of the department present. This fully demonstrates the great spirit of unity among the students of this department, which is worthy of admiration from outsiders. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, Director Xie delivered a speech. Director Xie's enthusiastic efforts for the entire department have been well-received by people both inside and outside the university. Especially in this semester, Professor Huang Tianpeng has tirelessly and patiently guided the students with all his strength, so the progress of this department has been rapid and is on the rise. As for Director Xie's speech, in addition to sincerely encouraging the students of this department, he also reported specific plans for future improvements and the addition of highly respected professors. Secondly, Director Xie hopes that the students can continue the spirit of unity from the past and make further efforts. This is of course extremely pertinent advice that the students of this department should deeply remember. This also fully shows Director Xie's enthusiastic hopes for the students.</p>
<p>Professor Huang Tianpeng has always been exceptionally humorous. This time, he still expressed his ardent love for the students with an extremely kind attitude. All the words that Professor Huang wanted to say this time have already been entrusted to Director Xie to announce, so Professor Huang only showed a loving smile and did not say a word. This time, there are a total of six graduates from this department: (1) Wang Deliang, (2) Shen Huanzong, (3) Tao Songqin, (4) Chen Peng, (5) Huang Shaochen, and (6) Chi Jiancheng. Director Xie has repeatedly introduced these six students to the students as the most powerful force in this department. However, this sudden departure from the school, from the perspective of the Journalism Department itself, is indeed like losing a pillar in the middle stream, which makes us feel sad. However, there are still core members of the department, such as Du Shaowen, who can make up for this biggest deficiency. In addition to Tao and Yang going to Japan to continue studying advanced journalism, the rest have secured important positions in major well-known newspapers in the country. This is a representation of the talented people created by this department. It is said that among the last graduates, there were two female students, one is Ms. Xiang Fuchun, who has stayed in Japan, and the other is Ms. Zhang Wusu, who will go to France. When they return to China in the future, they will make great contributions to the domestic journalism industry. This is what we expect, and it can be said to be the only good news in the domestic journalism industry.</p>
<p>Wang Deliang and Du Shaowen are the most hardworking core members of this department. This time, they drafted a document called "(Preliminary Plan for the Research Office of the Fudan University Journalism Department)," which is about 10,000 words long. It proposes specific plans that can serve as a reference for other universities in setting up journalism research offices. Due to space limitations, it is impossible to introduce it in detail, which is a pity. The creeds that students should abide by, written in the (Introduction), are very noteworthy. The general idea is: (From now on, let us be down-to-earth and pragmatic, and go to the research office to study journalism. The research office is the treasury of journalism, the source of journalism, the soul of journalism, the best place to study journalism, the best teacher of journalism, the place to cultivate journalism, and the testing ground for studying journalism. Go to the research office and support our research office...) Students of the true journalism department should abide by these creeds. The success of this research office is truly worthy of praise. Professor Huang Tianpeng has been specially invited to serve as the basic instructor of the research office, and Director Xie is, needless to say, an enthusiastic promoter.</p>
<p>Secondly, a liaison committee was organized to be solely responsible for the affairs of the research office. At that time, Yang Xing, Chen Zhaohua, and Tang Zengyang, among others, were elected to form the committee, and Director Xie designated Tang Zengyang to be responsible for convening meetings. In this way, the work of the Journalism Department's department council can continue to be carried out, which is something that other departments cannot do.</p>
<p>Finally, nine executive committee members were elected for the next term. The results were: (1) Du Shaowen, (2) Xu Shuming, (3) Zeng Guanzhi, (4) Huang Huanruo, (5) Tang Zengyang, (6) Guo Zhenyi, (7) Wang Yiwei, (8) Chen Zhaohua, and (9) Wei Yunxuan. The alternates were Chang Shouchang and five others. Ms. Guo and Ms. Wang are good at communication and have eloquent speech. They have in-depth research in journalism and are also core members of this department. Ms. Wang is usually noticed by female students from other departments. This time, they were both elected as executive committee members, and their achievements in handling affairs are expected to be considerable. This is what the students expect.</p>
<p>After the graduating students were sent off and took a group photo, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting. The exquisite refreshments prepared were also devoured.</p>
<p>Youth World Submission Guidelines</p>
<p>(1) The content of articles should be related to discussions on youth issues, domestic and foreign news about learning or students, essays, descriptions of school life, etc. The style is not limited.</p>
<p>(2) Drawings should be limited to those related to youth issues.</p>
<p>(3) Photos of youth life (such as sports, travel, excursions, theater, speeches, gatherings, exhibitions, various competitions, etc.), school news, and youth movements are welcome, whether individual or group.</p>

<p>Comments on Two Painting Exhibitions, by Lun Xi</p>
<p>Shanghai Art College and Shanghai Fine Arts College</p>
<p>Following the opening of the Shanghai Fine Arts College exhibition, the Shanghai Art College exhibition also opened. For a time, the intersection of Caishi Road and Jiangwan Road saw an increase in visitors. In the piercing cold wind, many young men and women visited the exhibition venues to feel the spirit of art and absorb the true meaning of life.</p>
<p>I am very happy because my love for art and painting sprouted in my childhood (confidence).</p>
<p>Painting exhibitions are my favorite thing to visit in my life. In front of the paintings at the venue, I can wash away all worries and replace them with a deep and beautiful feeling, making people feel happy, eliminating your feelings of disappointment, and helping you with the courage to fight. Especially a beautiful work, after seeing it, the impression it gives is deeply engraved in your heart, as if a sweet illusion floats in the awakened mind, vaguely recalling.</p>
<p>I wandered around the venues of these two exhibitions for a few days. At that time, I was intoxicated in them. Although there were some bad impressions, the beautiful ones still remain in my heart. Now I sit down to write this article, which is very impolite. (Polite criticism) is hypocrisy. I believe that people who study art will never like to accept other people's hypocritical criticism.</p>
<p>Comparing the merits of these two painting exhibitions, Shanghai Fine Arts College is inferior to Shanghai Art College. This is what I say impolitely. Why? The paintings in the entire venue of Shanghai Fine Arts College are mostly monotonous and gray, lacking individuality and creative vitality. Although there are a few that show novel expressions, the works of Shanghai Art College, among the immature works of young people, of course contain some immature things. However, the brilliance of individuality (creation) shines on the paintings on the walls. Several good oil paintings can overwhelm the achievements of the entire venue of this exhibition at Shanghai Fine Arts College. Comparing the quantity of works displayed at the exhibition venue, Shanghai Fine Arts College has more, while Shanghai Art College has less. It is better to have less quantity with better quality than more quantity with inferior quality. I sincerely hope that future painting exhibitions of other schools will be careful in selecting works to avoid wasting the spirit and valuable time of the viewers.</p>
<p>Regarding the spirit of order at the venues of these two exhibitions, Shanghai Fine Arts College is quite solemn in appearance, but in the venue, the nameplates under countless paintings rarely write the author's name and the title of the painting, which makes the viewers feel quite bored. Shanghai Art College is more orderly in the spirit of the display order in the venue. For this reason, I cannot write a detailed critique of Shanghai Fine Arts College and can only make a general critique.</p>
<p>I saw four oil paintings of human bodies at Shanghai Fine Arts College that were relatively perfect. The most noteworthy are the few in the mixed exhibition room. Two nude sketches and two male composition paintings. The color tone of one nude painting reflects the artist's somber mood, filling the entire painting with cold and bleak gray brushstrokes, bold and powerful, which can be considered a relatively perfect work. Another nude painting has a soft and beautiful color tone, which can express the beauty of women, removing the dull old clothes and showing a bright and lively appearance, which complements the previous somber one, creating a mutual interest.</p>
<p>Although there are many watercolor paintings on display, it is difficult to find a few vivid color tones on the crowded walls. Several landscapes are relatively refreshing and bright. As for still life, there are no perfect works. Those who are bold but lack the skills of cultivation often appear stiff and rough. Those who are better at coloring are timid and appear dull and tasteless.</p>
<p>After talking about the students' works, let's turn to the professors' works. There are more Chinese paintings in the professors' exhibition room, and only a dozen Western paintings are hung on the walls in the dark corner of the room. Comparing the entire room, the (portrait) painting of a male human face should be recommended as the best. The brushwork is lively and generous, and the color tone is soft and deep, which can fully express the heroic spirit of this male appearance. It is unknown who made this painting. There is no single name on the painting, and there is no label next to it, so the author's name is not written. There are a total of four better oil painting human bodies in that place, but only this one is good. The two charcoal paintings of human bodies are not much different from those made by students. The worst of the entire venue is the few Chinese-mounted watercolor paintings, all of which are landscapes. Each painting is filled with the same gray and flat tone. The perspective of those landscape paintings is the same for near and far colors, and the climate is forgotten, giving the impression of an ordinary scene. The composition is also too ordinary, which disappoints the reader.</p>
<p>I have not studied Chinese painting specifically, so I dare not say a word of criticism about the achievements of Chinese painting this time. The achievements of Shanghai Art College have been recorded in detail at the venue, with the names of the authors and the titles of the paintings. Originally, others had already criticized them in the newspapers, mostly with general criticisms. Now I will make a systematic and analytical criticism, which is of course different from others, but it is after my own selection. I have not recorded in detail any works that do not have very deep interest, but only recorded the good works in each exhibition room to make a very brief critique.</p>
<p>First Exhibition Room: Zong Wangwu's oil painting (Still Life) has a simple and skillful color tone, with deep interest, excellent in expressing the air of the objects and the nature of each object. Fei Shenjun's oil painting (On Jiangwan Road) has a beautiful and serene color tone, and the composition is balanced. It is a pity that the color of the road is too dark and conflicts with the color of the sky. Huang Yanwu's oil painting (Autumn Morning) can reveal the morning mist on the screen. There is too much green in the landscape, which loses the unity of the overall climate. Liang Chenjun's oil painting has a wonderful composition and scenery, but the expression of air is insufficient.</p>
<p>Second Exhibition Room: Du Shiqi's oil painting (On Jiangwan Road) has a unique color and scenery. The brushstrokes are generous and not perfunctory, with the style of a master. Qiu Renjun's pastel (One Morning) has excellent material, composition, and color. Using the green tone of the entire painting, lightly drawing a few strokes can express the hazy mist. Two workers repairing the streetcar track trenches are bending their backs and burying themselves in their work. Behind them, a horse-drawn garbage truck can better show the workers' labor and hardship. Several curved streetcar track routes are appropriately arranged on the painting. His oil painting (Self-Portrait) has a solemn and beautiful color tone, containing a solemn aura. Another oil painting (The Palace) has a color tone that can depict the dimness of light, a majestic and deep composition, and a moving mood. Du Shiqi's oil painting (Nude Woman) has a soft color tone and a rich and ambiguous fleshy feeling. The brushstrokes are fluent and refreshing, which can be called a representative masterpiece of the entire venue and surpasses the human body oil paintings of the entire venue of Shanghai Fine Arts College. Li Zhongsheng's watercolor (Self-Portrait) has a moist color tone and lively and interesting brushwork.</p>
<p>Third Exhibition Room: Qiu Renjun's design painting (Impression of the Bund) has a deep expression and a strict composition. It makes an incisive satirical judgment on the false peace situation of the Statue of Liberty on the Bund. The painting depicts the Statue of Liberty with political tools of various foreign imperialisms, such as airplanes and warships, filling the background. Under the Statue of Liberty, two large shells are deeply buried, symbolizing the deep penetration of imperialist aggression into the interior of China. It is shocking to the eye. I think that young people who have a passion for the survival of China should respectfully (think deeply) about this painting to arouse nationalistic thought. Liu Jiarang's oil painting (Exhibition of Colors) has a varied color tone. Li Zhongsheng's oil painting (Self-Portrait) has a brushwork that can express the taste of muscles. Feng Chaojun's (Oil Painting) (Nude Woman) has a mature and skillful brushwork, and the matching colors are harmonious and varied.</p>
<p>Fourth Exhibition Room: Zhao Jiajun's oil painting landscape (Bird's Eye View) has the style of a composition school. The color tone is novel, and the brushwork and composition are unique, revealing the personality of creation. The oil painting (Under the Scorching Sun) is also good. It is a pity that the climate of the entire painting is not appropriate. Although there is extremely strong sunlight, there is no feeling of heat in the color tone of the entire painting, and the air cannot be fully expressed. The oil painting (Village of Shanghai) has pure and quiet colors. Compared with the Bird's Eye View, it takes a different approach, transforming the natural scenery in the heart and re-casting it on the painting to achieve this masterpiece. Chen Huanjun's oil painting (Reflection) has a good composition, but the color of the entire painting lacks variation. The brushwork is bold and powerful. Feng Chaojun's oil painting (Portrait)</p>
<p>has a quiet color tone and expresses the taste of muscles and the liveliness of the spirit quite adequately.</p>
<p>Fifth Exhibition Room: Du Shiqi's oil painting (Nude Woman) has a beautiful color tone, with the moving beauty of a young girl's rich muscles. The matching colors are especially good. Qiu Renjun's oil painting (Landscape) can reveal the dull and gloomy air of the entire painting. The color of the water shadow is simple and clear, expressing the liveliness of the water. However, the air color of the sky is too dark and mixes with the color of the rooftops in the distance. Zhou Jishan's oil painting (Winter Day) has a color tone that is too simple and lacks variation.</p>
<p>Sixth Exhibition Room: This exhibition room displays</p>
<p>the works of the professors of Shanghai Art College. I feel that the most meaningful and worthy of our praise in the entire venue (in terms of subject matter) are the three oil paintings by Mr. Zhu Yingpeng. The composition is novel, and the subject matter is taken from the imagination of human affairs. The (Earth Mother) is solemn, moving, and thought-provoking. (Hou Yi Shooting the Sun) can express the author's tense mood. (Describing) Yaksha (The red color of a painting is too bright. If it is slightly dimmed and other cold colors are used, it will be more harmonious and beautiful, showing the terror of the night from a gloomy place. Mr. Zhu Yingpeng's use of color likes to use deep and dark cold colors and bright red and orange colors. See (Hou Yi Shooting the Sun) and (Earth Mother) for the color tone of the two paintings, which shows his personality tendency.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Chen Baoyi's work, oil painting (Still Life and Landscape, has a simple and honest flavor with an old-fashioned color tone. The brushwork is vigorous, unrestrained, and lively. (Miss K) has good colors, but because the face is painted too large, I feel that the portrait paintings of women should be smaller to express the melancholy of women.</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>Beauty.</p>
<p>Mr. Yi Dexian's paintings only have two still life oil paintings (Bottle) is a bit better than (Musical Instrument) has good brushstrokes and strong brushstrokes. The research on color tone tends to be sincere and simple in expression.</p>
<p>Ms. Guan Zilan's work, oil painting still life (Grapes) is better, which can express the life of the fruit and the floating air between the table cloths. Mr. Wang Daoyuan's painting is also good. Mr. Chen Zhifo's design painting has unique originality and originality in color matching and composition. It has a deep oriental artistic flavor and is not the same as Western patterns. There is no vulgarity of petty craftsmen. The decorative pattern is especially good.</p>
<p>At the end of the written page, I have a few words to offer to everyone, especially the professors. Why is the achievement of Shanghai Fine Arts College so disappointing this time? It cannot be entirely said that the students of the Fine Arts College are not progressing, but that they have been blindly hypnotized and buried their own creations (personalities). They rely on the teachings of the teachers and act as slaves to imitation. The professors advocate using gray to uniformly gray out the color tones of all the students in the school. When we walk into the venue to see it, we will naturally feel bored and bored because there is too much gray, which makes people feel dull.</p>
<p>Gray can sometimes be used to show its melancholic beauty on the painting. It can also get good results if the gray tones are used appropriately to create a picture. The value of gray in painting is like the value of vinegar in cooking, but teaching students to specialize in gray is to harm the creation of young people's personalities. I hope they will correct this teaching method in the future.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art College has been established for a short time, but it can surpass the old brand of Shanghai Fine Arts College in terms of achievements. The reason is that it has achieved progress through an advocacy of personal creation. A proposition of personal theory has therefore retreated and fallen behind. I think no one can deny it. In the future, I hope that the students of Shanghai Art College will work harder to progress and create a good image in Chinese painting in the future. As for the students of Shanghai Fine Arts College, I sincerely hope that they will jump out of the gray maze and each create an art that expresses their own personality.</p>
<p>Japanese Imperial Exhibition of Western Paintings</p>
<p>Japanese Correspondence, Xie Haiyan</p>
<p>(Continuation 4)</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about Mr. Makino Torao's (Loofah). In a beautiful garden on a sunny day, there is a loofah shed. Under the shed, a woman in Western clothes is sitting. The painting materials are very thematic. The main tone of the color is established based on strong vermilion and yellow and cold blue-green. The style is somewhat reminiscent of a country's Eastern atmosphere, but there is no sense of inappropriateness in the beauty of transparent ease. Mr. Makino is the youngest of the examiners. He likes to drink, drum, play ball, and fly kites most of his life. I dare say that if he doesn't have whiskey to drink or a stick ball to play one day, he will definitely not be able to live. His personality is very interesting, and no one in the art world doesn't like to be friends with him. Now I will introduce Mr. Satomi Jun's play, a praise of Mr. Makino's image to everyone so you may recognize his dignity:</p>
<p>Is shrimp imitation of immortals</p>
<p>Is an amateur's photograph blurry and indistinct</p>
<p>Vermilion red</p>
<p>Can also be said to be: ripe steamed buns</p>
<p>Laughing heartily, an all-round offensive and defensive master hand</p>
<p>Sounds like the broadcasting bell in the parking lot</p>
<p>SINSINJENYJENG···</p>
<p>·····</p>
<p>Let me introduce another good drinking examiner, Mr. Katada Tokuro's (Portrait), which seems a bit stiff. Although the concise and comprehensive brushstrokes and steady and sincere colors are his usual skills, he cannot escape the typical SALOON style ACADEMY, which is an infinite regret.</p>
<p>Member of the Imperial Art Academy, Wada Eisaku's (Early Spring) is extremely bad. It is a spring scene of Mount Fuji. It is a pity that he can paint it like a collotype landscape photograph. It is so beautiful and delicate, but unfortunately, there is a strip of paper next to it indicating (Women are welcome to visit) or (Special viewing seats for children), etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Kobayashi Mango's (Light Gauze) is a portrait of a Korean woman. The style of following the customs is as worthless as Mr. Wada's (Early Spring).</p>
<p>The author of (Gorge Hot Spring), a painting of many beautiful and sensual Japanese nude women bathing in a gorge hot spring, Mr. Nakazawa Hiromitsu, is this year's director of the Western Painting Department of the Imperial Exhibition's second section. In terms of the official school faction in Japan, his skills cannot be said to be very detached, but he is slightly more active in handling affairs than them. He likes to paint genre paintings, landscapes, and nude paintings, with a bit of romantic smell (To be continued)</p>

<p>Dogs and Saint-Saëns</p>
<p>The reason why the genius painter Saint-Saëns always disliked dogs in his life was because of his too casual clothes.</p>
<p>The buttons on his coat and vest were all missing. The collar was only like a thin silk thread wrapped around his neck. He was also wearing a strange high hat. Coupled with his tattered painting clothes containing paints, everyone was surprised by his posture. Dogs naturally regarded him as a swindler and beggar and barked madly at him.</p>
<p>As soon as they saw his shadow, the dogs in the wild barked together. He had no choice but to retreat silently and run home from the wild.</p>
<p>Once he saw a news article about the police driving away stray dogs, he specially ran to reward those policemen as revenge for the dogs (Su)</p>
