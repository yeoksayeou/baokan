<h3 id="c7">海約簽字後之德西 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>倫敦條約簽字後。五國以外各强國對於此約之態度如何。亦有注意之價值。德國前駐日大使某博士。近曾發表意見。希望各國進一步平等裁减陸軍。謂德國防軍祇有十萬。而東西南三面之近鄰。皆保有一百二十萬之大軍。如他國以後仍得自由武裝。德獨不能武裝自衛。則平等安在。此德人之態度也。西班牙海軍總長宣稱。倫敦條約雖足以鼓勵軍縮。然西班牙在海軍上。必須有適宜之自衛力。以保護羣島。故仍將繼續其海軍建設程序。并表示不久將。舉行會操。此西人之態度也。</p>
<p>德國無海軍可言。故僅言陸軍。表面雖以希望減軍爲言。實則有感於軍備之不平等。含有多則俱多。不能使德國獨少之意。蓋德國目前雖爲財政所困阨。然其奮勇邁進。以圖恢復戰前勢力。固未嘗一日或忘者也。至於西班牙勃勃。之雄心。則更顯然呈露。蓋西班牙本以非洲沿岸之羣島屬地。爲其立國之命脈自摩洛哥戰事失敗後。於競爭海權上受一大打擊。於是欲得坦及爾之心益急。以坦及爾在摩洛哥之西北。爲大西洋入地中海之重要門戸。可稱海軍良港。故起而與英法兩國爭。以冀桑榆之收。意國以與地中海有關。亦要求參加會議。但久不能决。在西班牙方面。以爲欲維持地中海均勢。非將坦及爾劃歸其版圖不可。而英法等國。爲本國利害計。又不能放棄不爭。故雖西班牙以退出聯盟相要挾。而英法方面。絕不爲動。西班牙因此問題失敗。於是益思擴張海軍。表面爲防人侵占其海上之權利。而實則念念不忘於求達未達之目的。以發展其地中海之勢力。故此次倫敦會議英法意間縱無論若何裁减海軍。而西班牙則决不肯隨聲和附。爲此同樣之舉動也。由斯以觀。今後减軍之阻力。亦多矣哉。</p>

<p>閘北　昨日來源甚稀、計十號左右、市銷奇呆、北粳去路尤滯、除高粳平正外、中次又軟角半、市勢頗形不振、實緣店胃觀望、貨客求售、或將步下未奇、薄稻高定次疲、到微銷淡、交易寥寥、羊杜秈來船缺乏、底貨又罄、因此秈市大爲寂寞、價格勉告平穏、刻下市塲之進出、大都祗廠棧之存貨也白元買主無胃積貨尚有、市乃下游高貨開十八元三四角</p>
<p>滬南　河下來船續稀、買氣沉寂、常錫蘇同各機粳、始終平庸緣需要清淡、零拆不化、而此間存底又以中關爲多、故趨勢高貨益穏、中次益軟市盤約小近尺、南帮薄稻·早稻依然站定、本街竟少問津、客帮亦無進意、於是愈覺呆木、羊杜尖熼常凋零、各方均注重洋米故全日秈市極無準地、通變仍告平庸、陰元略帶緊切、中關開十七元一二角</p>

<p>明·</p>
<p>女湯麥斯曼底最出名的三部作品、（布敦勃洛克）（Die　Buddenbrooks）、（魔山）（Der　Zanberberg）、（威尼斯之死）（Der　Tod　in　Venedig）裏、（布敦勃洛克）是被認爲他的最偉大的作品的這部巨著曾被批評家稱爲德國自然主義文學的登峯造極的作品、以爲它的内容的豐滿、結構的完美、在近代文學中實在是不可多得的作品、不但作者因了這部小說而可以儕身於世界偉大作家之列、就是德國的近代文壇即使祗產生這一部作品、也可以無愧云云、這一番話當然是極盡贊美之能事了、但說得並不過分、因爲（布敦勃洛克）正是那樣的一本書、不過、我們要知道、它並不是曼底後期、却是曼早年的第一部長篇小說、他這部小說在德國出版時、他還祇二十七歲、但是在幾年前就開始寫子、二十多歲的青年寫成了這樣偉大成熟的作品、眞使人不能不驚異他那天才的蓬勃了、</p>
<p>曼創作這部小說的歷史是如此的、曼在十八歲到孟立克（Munich）去、在一家火險公司當一個没有薪俸的下級職員、那是他的文學事業的開始、因爲他在那里偷閒寫了一篇名呌（墮落）的小說、後來發表在一個雜誌上的、這篇小說頗引起讀者底注意、於是曼就走出了那個火險公司到孟立克大學去念書、希望將來從事於新聞事業、但後來他跟了他哥哥亨利（Heinrich）到意大利去、他哥哥那時還是一個研究美術的青年（現在也是一位有名的大作家了、）他們一同住在羅馬的阿根庭街、曼在這時期努力的研究文學、讀了許多外國作家的作品、他最喜歡的是托爾斯泰、一方面呢、他自然是努力創作、他寫着短篇小說、和一部很長的長篇小說、所以、當他從意大利回到孟立克時、他身邊帶着（布敦勃洛克）底未完之稿、這部稿子是在羅馬開始在孟立克完成的、但在這部作品出版以前、他先發表了一部短篇小說集、（小弗利得曼先生）（Der　Cleine　Herr　Friedemann）、這些用流利自如的風格所寫的小說使讀者覺得他那與衆不同的地方、因此很引起、些注意、這些小說也都是在意大利寫的、但如内中很少南國的風味、却頗具斯干迭那維亞的情調、這時曼寫了許多短篇小說、在德國各著名文學刋物上發表、於是漸漸地出名起來了、當時有一位作家到他家裏去拜訪他、看見他在一架批霞娜之旁、和一幅托爾斯泰像之下、寫着（布敦勃洛克）底最後的數頁、曼從他的稿本中讀了一頁給他的來客聽、那人得到很好的印象、</p>
<p>這部很厚的稿本後來送去給柏林的著名出版家費虚（Pichor）、但是沉悶不安的等了好久、書店裏還没有給他回音、他等得不耐煩起來了、凑巧有一個當兵的作家馬丹士（Kurt　Martens）勸他去當兵、曼就實行了他的勸告、可是他當兵當不慣、操練的辛勞、和等待書店回信的焦灼、竟使他病倒了、當書店的回信來時、他已經睡在床上病着、書店底來信簡短得很、這部小說太長了、（把那叚楔子剪短來、以便能印成一本書、）曼送去的回信也短得很、大意是、（要就兩本、不然一本也不出）、於是書店只好同意了、把這部小說印成兩本出版、</p>
<p>（布敦勃洛克）一出版就建築了曼在文壇上的聲譽、不久就傳遍歐洲、在德國是早已成爲一本家家必備的書了、（下次刋登（布敦勃洛克）述略））</p>
<h3 id="c85">告志望　做美術家的人 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>山本鼎著·</p>
<p>陳抱一譯·</p>
<p>這是頗煩難的問題呵、</p>
<p>特指志望做美術家的人所預須存心覺悟的事是没有的、這是同志於做醫生的人、志於做法律家的人、志於做軍人的的志於做商人的人等所預須存心覺的事、彷彿一樣的、</p>
<p>要勉强說起來也至多就說、美術家的生涯原非營利的、故不可不覺悟貧窮便是、即在美術愛好者多的佛蘭西那邊、尚且有諺說、</p>
<p>說道、（畫家出了、家道會破敗）的呢這的確是眞的呵、所以憂慮子弟身世的父兄叔伯極力反對他們做美術學生的、却也難怪、像我以前也曾經見有許許多多志望爲美術家的青年來接膝商談過、但我每次總說、（若爲娛樂而幹那是極好、若要做專門家、那我是不贊成）、而拂退了他們的、</p>
<p>算什麽、貧窮、原在什麽境遇也是有的、然而一想到伴有辛辣的功利底社會上之生存競爭來、也就想勸止、又一面、在痛切地嘗過了美術的困難來的我、也就不願他們這麽輕率投進美術界方面了、原來、現在的日本、美術家是太多呢、美術家的人數太多、而一方面却又因不懂美術的民衆多、所以困窘呢、然而將因了世間的美術鑑賞眼增高、致似是而非的美術家大被淘汰的時期必定會到來無疑、美術青年雖不及文學青年那般多、但在無論那個村中、也至少有一個有着三脚凳的青年、假使他於東京的展覽會、即入選了一次、便立刻斡起作品的頒布會（譯者註、作品頒面會或稱畫會丨即畫家臨時規定潤格、在一定期間内以預約的方法賣畫的）來、倘若結果又是成功的、那就居然擺起一個美術學生架子、而想做專門家了、與吾輩的學生時代比較起來、則今日的青年、功利的觀念却實然是激烈、其智慧的用法却實然是打算的啊、</p>
<p>爲適合於美術家的性質、第一要敏感而且是樂天的、體力須强如軍人、然而却要恬靜的性質呢、因爲美術家的生活、結局是（看）和（做）、故可說、從小孩時候就喜歡看和做的、是適於爲美術家的人吧、照這樣說、那末像我這種要算是不適任哪、聽說、　我曾經喜歡看、然描寫却不大喜歡的、</p>
<p>記得什麽時候、我曾向母親問過、我從少年時代、旣見有可成爲畫家的模樣没有、但據母親的回想、則說並不見有如此情形、聽說、在小孩時候、我喜歡結弄風筆的繫線、曾經聚精會神地在結縛着長的繫線和短的繫線等、我之成了美術家的、却因由少年期修習西洋木版的彫刻所致、把他人所繪的畫、例如渡邊審也氏和石川寅治氏等畫家所描的版底、用數萬條三角刀的線條來刻出、却非容易、但印刷了出來的結果、則比之是版的趣味更見得是畫的趣味、我雖是小孩、也感到複製的彫版之没興趣、而一心想着要成爲如審也氏或石川氏那樣的畫家的、却就是成爲畫家這事的起端了、從此、便在星期日或夜間修習着鉛筆畫、當二十一歲時、乘得免徵兵之機會、而投考美術學校、其實也靠了考榜末名始得入學的、關於美術學生時代的事情、當讓幾時再談、照我自己的經騐說來、就是祇在美術學校畢業了的一些程度、對於繪畫的事情還是什麽都不懂得的、</p>
<p>然而便是今日、在美術學生於修習上便宜的地方、也還算東京美術學校吧、在東京雖則也有四五間研究所、自修的人在那裏自由研究着、但也並没有什麽學風、爲主任敎師、雖則有大家的名字揭着、然而直接指導却又是極其稀罕、所以、作爲專門家的修業、是很靠不住的、</p>
<p>要之、我以爲凡志於美術的人、務須從確實的師匠學習纔好、又在乎沈毅地用功、讀得廣博些、於自己的工作上、除除把骨和肉來添附上去的沈着力却是必要的呢、縱使是無論有怎樣天才潛着的人、若修業墮於無秩序也就不行、易厭倦的也不會成功、像我的從弟、已物故的村山槐多那般、雖然在我所直授的美術學生之中算是拔羣者了、然而却因了太過是情熱的緣故、致特具的天才也竟不至於立體的發揮而夭折了、我覺得不論何事、凡所謂做作的事、非以像建築那樣的要領幹去不可、</p>

<p>Wan Xuancai's Vanguard Reaches Guide</p>
<p>Military Conference to be Held in Zhengzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zheng telegram: Feng, in the name of Deputy Commander, ordered Sun Wan and Shi's armies to advance. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Xuancai's representative, Zang Shoupeng, said that Wan's vanguard troops had reached Guide. As of the evening of the 24th, no conflict had occurred. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Xuancai appointed Zang Shoupeng as the director of the Beiping office. Zang arrived last night, using the Dasha on Xingbu Street as the office location, preparing everything. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wan Xuancai telegraphed Yan, requesting Jin to send several experienced county magistrates to Bian. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Military report: Feng scheduled a military conference in Zhengzhou on the 1st, summoning Jin and Northwest generals. It is expected that military activities, which have been dormant, will have considerable impetus by the beginning of next month. Intelligence reports that the Central Army defenses in Hankou and Xuzhou are extremely solid, making it difficult to advance along the Pinghan and Longhai lines. It is planned to first attack Shandong to obtain a coastal outlet for supplies. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Feng Yuxiang sent Tai Bin to Tianjin (arrived on the 26th) for negotiations. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Yuanquan telegraphed the Headquarters, citing a telegram from Zhao Wenqi stating that a regiment of enemy weapons was seized in Xing'an, Southern Shaanxi, a battalion in Baihe, and no rebels were found in Longjuzhai, Shangnan. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to intelligence reports from the Headquarters, Feng's political staff stated that Feng's army originally intended to move west to Xichuan, Neixiang, and Laohekou, east to Zhengzhou, and south to Linru and Jiaxian. Later, due to deep disagreements with Yan, it was decided to take the opportunity to attack Jin. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Official direct telegram from Beiping: (1) According to a certain military expert, the Jin army has complex factions and numerous leaders, making it extremely difficult to find a suitable commander. Xu Yongchang, as the commander-in-chief of the front, is merely holding a nominal position. Internal generals may not sincerely obey. Xu also deeply knows the situation and has not dared to exercise his powers. Therefore, the Shijiazhuang command post is simply a formality, and the Taiyuan headquarters has no systematic organization. Military and political affairs are especially chaotic. (2) A part of Feng's army in western Henan urgently returned to Tongguan on the 24th. It is rumored that Yan's intention is that, fearing Feng arriving in Zhengzhou, he intends to take the opportunity to seize Tongguan, cutting off Feng's retreat to seize the Shaanxi territory. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Special dispatch from Tianjin: (1) Feng arrived in Gengye, Zhengzhou, summoned Lu Zhonglin, Sun Liangcheng, Shi Jingting, and others for a meeting, then received a confidential report from Liu Ruming in Tongguan and hurriedly returned to Tongguan. His whereabouts are extremely secret, and there seems to be a change in the Henan situation. (2) According to sources in Tianjin's banking sector, Yan has recently issued 10 million yuan of Jin currency in the Tianjin area, draining almost all the cash from the two provinces and transporting it back to Shanxi, causing abnormal panic in Tianjin's financial circles. (3) The slogans and banners posted by Yan's troops in the city have been torn down by the public at night. They are torn down as soon as they are posted. There are also those who smear the slogans supporting Yan and Feng with manure, which is enough to show the people's sentiment. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Germany and Spain After the Signing of the Hague Agreement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>After the signing of the London Treaty, the attitudes of countries outside the five powers towards the treaty are also worth noting. A certain German former ambassador to Japan recently expressed his opinion, hoping that all countries would further equally reduce their land forces, saying that Germany's defense force is only 100,000, while its neighbors on the east, west, and south all maintain a large army of 1.2 million. If other countries are still free to arm themselves in the future, and Germany alone cannot arm itself for self-defense, where is the equality? This is the attitude of the Germans. The Spanish Naval Chief of Staff declared that although the London Treaty is sufficient to encourage arms reduction, Spain must have appropriate self-defense forces in its navy to protect the islands. Therefore, it will continue its naval construction program and indicated that it will hold exercises soon. This is the attitude of the Spanish.</p>
<p>Germany has no navy to speak of, so it only speaks of the army. On the surface, it speaks of hoping to reduce the army, but in reality, it feels the inequality of armaments, implying that if there is more, there should be more together, and Germany alone should not be less. Although Germany is currently troubled by finance, it has never forgotten its determination to forge ahead and restore its pre-war strength. As for Spain's rising ambitions, they are even more clearly revealed. Spain regards the islands and territories along the African coast as the lifeline of its nation. After the failure of the Morocco war, it suffered a major blow in the competition for sea power. Therefore, it is increasingly eager to obtain Tangier, which is located in the northwest of Morocco and is an important gateway to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. It can be called a good naval port. Therefore, it rose up to compete with Britain and France, hoping to gain something in the end. Italy, being related to the Mediterranean Sea, also requested to participate in the meeting, but it could not be decided for a long time. Spain believes that to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean, Tangier must be incorporated into its territory. However, Britain, France, and other countries, for the sake of their own interests, cannot give up the dispute. Therefore, even though Spain threatened to withdraw from the alliance, Britain and France were unmoved. Spain failed on this issue and therefore thought more about expanding its navy. On the surface, it is to prevent others from encroaching on its maritime rights, but in reality, it has not forgotten its unachieved goal of developing its Mediterranean power. Therefore, no matter how Britain, France, and Italy reduce their navies in this London Conference, Spain will never follow suit and take the same actions. From this perspective, there will be many obstacles to arms reduction in the future.</p>

<p>The Central Propaganda Department issued a message to workers in commemoration of the May 1st Labor Day. The original text is as follows: (Dear workers, today is the May 1st Labor Day. It commemorates the day in 1886, 26 years before the founding of the Republic of China, when workers in Chicago, USA, united many labor groups and held a large-scale demonstration demanding an eight-hour workday, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest, which they eventually won. This movement broke the old system of European and American capitalists forcing workers to work 12 to 15 hours a day. Later, this day was designated as a memorial day for workers all over the world. This great May 1st Labor Movement is worth celebrating enthusiastically. Dear workers, in the midst of this enthusiastic celebration of May 1st, the most important thing is to understand the position of Chinese workers and recognize the path of our future efforts. The position of Chinese workers is very different from that of foreign workers. To know what position Chinese workers are in, we must first know what position the Chinese nation is in now. China is currently the poorest and weakest country in the world, suffering from all kinds of oppression from imperialists. Its current position is only that of a semi-colony. The reason for this is that the indentures (unequal treaties) have not yet been completely abolished. Since the position of the country is very low, the position of our people is naturally also very low. The position of workers is certainly no exception. If we workers want to improve our own position, we must think from the position of the entire nation. Only by raising the position of the country first can our own position be raised. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of our Party, once said to the workers that workers are not only responsible to their own groups, but also have a greater responsibility outside their own groups. What is this greater responsibility? It is the responsibility of the citizens, that is, to take on the responsibility of raising the position of the country. If you cannot take on this responsibility, you will be slaves of foreigners. If you can take on this responsibility and turn China into the world's leading power, you will be the world's leading workers. Since we recognize the position and responsibility of Chinese workers, then our labor movement should not only be a simple movement for the interests of the workers themselves, but a national revolutionary movement for the interests of the entire nation. Therefore, if we Chinese workers want to be liberated, we must unite under the Three Principles of the People and work together with the people of the whole country to abolish all unequal treaties and restore the position of our nation. At the same time, we must recognize that China is an industrially backward country. Chinese handicrafts are oppressed by international capital imperialism, and both employers and employees suffer the same pain. Even in self-operated machine industries, the so-called capitalists are actually squeezed by imperialists. Unlike developed industries in Europe and the United States, which have surplus products, they seize markets abroad and carry out economic aggression on the one hand, and manipulate political power and oppress workers with their huge wealth on the other. The Premier of our Party told us that China's industry has not yet developed and machine production is not yet prevalent, so China does not have the same large capitalists as foreign countries. After foreign countries had machine production, large capitalists emerged, and workers suffered great harm from capitalists. Chinese workers are not yet harmed by domestic capitalists. Our country does not yet have large capitalists to oppress workers. Chinese workers are oppressed by foreign capitalists. It can be seen that the pain of our workers is entirely caused by the economic aggression of imperialists. Now, to eliminate the suffering of our country's workers, it is not only necessary to passively hate the development and severe aggression of imperialist economies, but also to actively seek the development of production and the revitalization of industry. Once the foundation of the country is rich, it can naturally supply its needs, and naturally there is no need to rely on foreigners anymore, and the economy of foreigners will also lose its aggressive effect. The pain of our workers being oppressed by imperialism will also disappear without a trace. Therefore, to become strong, we must be self-reliant, and to discipline others, we must discipline ourselves. Our most important task at present is to follow the Premier's plan for national reconstruction and work together to revitalize state-owned industries, develop mineral resources, develop transportation, build roads, and increase national production in order to open up a path for workers to make a living. Otherwise, the oppression of capital imperialism will become increasingly severe, and both employers and employees will perish together. At that time, the plight of the workers will be even more unimaginable. (To be continued) Commander-in-Chief Chiang Goes North to Inspect Troops</p>
<p>He Yingqin, He Chengjun, and others all accompany him. Will return to Hankou after inspecting the various troops. Hankou Correspondence After Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Hankou on the 24th, he summoned He Yingqin, the director of the headquarters, and He Chengjun, the commander-in-chief of the Third Army, to inquire about the military situation in northern Hubei and southern Henan, and held a consultation. It was decided to travel north by the same train on the 25th to inspect the troops stationed in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. That evening, the political and military circles set up a banquet at the headquarters to welcome Chiang and his entourage. After the banquet, Chiang met with the military commanders stationed in Hubei. Wang Jinyu also rushed from Minggang. Chiang inquired about the situation of each army in detail and gave instructions in person. He also instructed He Yingqin, the director of the headquarters, to quickly telegraph Xu Yuanquan and other generals to temporarily not come to Hankou, but to reorganize their units in their respective defense areas and wait for inspection. On the 25th, the railway bureau's special train was ready and the fire was lit. At 1:00 PM, Chiang departed from the headquarters and boarded the train at the Dazhimen Railway Station. Those accompanying him included He Yingqin, He Chengjun, Wang Jinyu, Zhao Guantao, He Jingwu, as well as Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, Cao Haosen, Gao Lingbai, and others who came from Nanjing, and the 49th Regiment was dispatched by Army Commander Jiang Dingwen to escort him, and Army Commander Xia Douyin dispatched troops to guard the area.

Bandits in Taihu County, Anhui Province, Have Withdrawn Anqing Correspondence Since the fall of Taihu, people in this province have paid close attention to it. Today, the provincial government received news from the telegraph office saying that the bandits had left the city on the 21st and fled west. A telegram was sent to Police Team Leader Duan to search for the bandits' traces. Later, a telegram was received from the Taihu Temporary Security Committee saying: "(The county number) (20th) was captured by Han, Ma (21st) left the city and fled to Ying. The county magistrate and various agencies fled first. No one is in charge. The people organized a security committee to temporarily maintain order. In addition to reporting in detail, this is a special report," and so on. It is reported that the provincial government's Department of Civil Affairs has ordered County Magistrate Qian to return to the county as soon as possible to handle the aftermath. A Freight Station Will Be Built on the Longhai Railway in Xuzhou Xuzhou Correspondence Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Administration, plans to take back the land on the northern section of Zhongzheng Street to build a freight station. He went from Xuzhou to Nanjing on the 17th and returned to Xuzhou on the 19th. Regarding the construction of the freight station and the addition of branch lines, the Ministry of Railways has approved the construction of the freight station first, followed by the branch lines. More than ten representatives of businessmen, including Ding Yinzhou, Zhang Guichen, and Lan Hongtao from the East China Sea, petitioned the Ministry of Railways, the headquarters of the Second Army, the county government, and the public security bureau. On the 23rd, they visited Mr. Qian again. According to Qian's reply, the construction of the freight station is to rectify transportation and develop the business of the railway. Although the previously rented land extends for more than ten li from Erbawowo in the north to the southern end of Dama Road, only the section from Erbawowo to the northern end of Zhongzheng Street will be taken back. The larger and more orderly houses number no more than seven or eight hundred. The southern section will definitely not be used. Since the representatives have pleaded for the difficulties of businessmen and the hardship of the people, it has been decided to reduce the lively market area east of Zhongzheng North Street by 40 meters (equivalent to about 3.2 zhang of the construction scale) to avoid affecting business. A large road will be built on the south street facing east to connect to the freight station to facilitate transportation. These flexible measures require relocation within two months. The representatives of the merchants have expressed satisfaction with this. It is now reported that Mr. Qian is planning to revise the route with Chief Engineer Bira. A disturbance has been put to rest. As for the issue of building a branch line from Bayiji to Taizhuang, Mr. Qian has discussed with Chief Engineer Bira to go from Xuzhou to the eastern section of the Longhai Railway for survey on the 23rd, but the required funds are about one million yuan, which needs to be investigated by the Ministry of Railways before it can be started. In addition, a freight train with 28 cars from Xuzhou to Xinpu on the Longhai Railway was derailed by bandits at around 2:00 AM on the 21st between Caopu and Baitabu. At that time, the firepower was sufficient and it could not be stopped. The train dragged along the ground, and more than a hundred sleepers were destroyed. Many goods were overturned on the ground, but fortunately no one was injured. The Xinpu Railway Bureau sent people to repair it, and the repair was completed at around 9:00 AM on the 23rd, and the train resumed traffic. The Japanese Are Actively Developing Niuzhuang Opening Four Wharves to Resist Huludao Establishing Transportation Companies to Monopolize Trade Goods Shenyang Correspondence Yingkou, also known as Niuzhuang, was the only major port for trade in Northeast China twenty years ago. Since the Japanese developed Dalian, its trade has been taken away. As a result, the import and export of Northeast China have also been manipulated by the Japanese, which greatly hinders the development of our country's economy. The Liaoning authorities, in order to recover their rights and develop the industry of Eastern Mongolia, have been preparing last year and opened Huludao as a major port in Northeast China on April 15 this year. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese believed that it was harmful to Dalian. In addition to trying to undermine it (such as spreading rumors that the construction of Huludao port has British and French capital, and the Chinese have no ability to open the port, etc.), they are also actively developing Yingkou to resist it. For example, at the end of this month, Mantetsu opened the first, second, third, and fourth wharves in Dongniujiatun. In the future, if they are successful, they can accommodate ten giant ships. The trade goods of all wharves in Yingkou can be absorbed by them, and various undertakings related to the local area near the station will be expanded. On the one hand, Japanese shipping companies are increasing the number of voyages to Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places to supplement port services. On the other hand, the local Japanese consul is promoting the sales of Japanese goods and encouraging Japanese businessmen to set up more import stores. Japan's largest international transportation company in Northeast China (with a capital of 20 million) has also established a branch in Hebei, appointing Ueda as the president to compete with Chinese transportation companies, attracting cargo transportation to Jinchou and Xihuikou and other places. In the future, if it is successful, the trade industry in Yingkou will be controlled by the Japanese. The people of the country should take measures to save it. It is found that the Japanese established the Yingkou Wharf Office in Niujiatun in the winter of Meiji 43 (1910), and built wharves. Later, they expanded it year by year, investing hundreds of thousands of yuan each year. Currently, there are two locations, A and B, with a wall length of more than 4,000 feet, which can accommodate five ships of 3,000 tons. The annual import and export volume is about one million tons. The import of Japanese goods into Yingkou's various wharves was worth more than 6.39 million taels of silver in the Republic of China's 17th year. There are 2,600 Japanese expatriates in Yingkou. Shops with capital of more than one million include one bank, one oil mill, two transportation merchants, and four others. (Zhendan News Agency) Harbin Electric Power Company Changed to State-Run Jilin Correspondence The electrical business in Harbin has always been controlled by the Japanese. Previously, officials and businessmen in Jilin Province tried to recover it and established the Harbin Electric Power Company. After ten years of operation, it has gradually become effective. The provincial government believed that when the company was founded, it originally planned to raise funds from shareholders and be jointly operated by officials and businessmen, so it was named a company. Now, after several years, all the funds have been allocated by the former provincial government from the Yongheng Official Silver Exchange. This is not in line with the original purpose of raising shares. In January of this year, Liu Jun, the general manager of the Official Silver Exchange, was appointed as the director of the company, and another co-director was appointed to assist the general manager in handling the affairs. The director and co-director were ordered to draft a reorganization charter and submit it for approval. However, since the company's name is not in line with the actual situation, it should be changed first to reflect the actual situation. Yesterday, the company's name was approved and changed to Harbin Electric Power Bureau, directly under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and supervised by the creditor Yongheng Official Silver Exchange. From now on, it will be completely changed to state-run. (April 17) Wuhu Express Letter The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce believes that the Municipal Government's creation of a wharf tax is inevitable, so it invited various merchant guilds to a meeting yesterday and decided to ask the Municipal Government to change the wharf tax to a municipal tax, and the tax rate shall not exceed 4% of the customs tax rate. The Municipal Government has generally approved this, and it will be implemented after reporting to the provincial government for approval. Various merchant guilds are currently consulting on the tax rate standards for various goods. The Wuhu New Customs Second Deputy discovered 78 catties of opium at the Taikoo Wharf yesterday morning on the Anqing wheel. It has been transferred by Harry King, the Revenue Officer, to the Wuhu Customs Superintendent's Office for investigation. After Huoshan County in central Anhui Province was captured by bandits, it has not yet been recovered. The first, second, and third section chiefs of the county were killed by the bandits. There is now a tendency to invade Liu'an in the north. Qingshan Town, 50 li from Liu'an, has been occupied by the bandits, and many houses have been burned down. The bandits lurking near Liu'an are also taking the opportunity to move around, occupying the southwestern river mouth and other places. The current situation in Liu'an is extremely dangerous. As for the Anqing area, after the fall of Yingshan and Taihu, the Wuhu Garrison Regiment immediately sent a battalion of troops to defend it, and the people's hearts are relatively stable. It is also reported that the headquarters of the Wuhu Garrison Regiment will be moved from Wuhu to Anqing within the next few days. The Provincial Party Headquarters instructed the Wuhu Minguo Daily to stop publication immediately because the president, manager, and others of the newspaper were not responsible in their work. Zhang Xiugao, a supervisory committee member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, was dispatched to take over and reorganize it. Peng Ziming, Yuan Limin, Pan Zefang, Pan Baoting, and other reactionary suspects who were arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Sanmei Nunnery were ordered to be escorted to the province. Today, the Public Security Bureau has sent personnel to escort them to the province for interrogation. (April 25) Local Correspondence Songjiang Conference of the Real Estate Police Donation Reorganization Committee The First District Real Estate Police Donation Reorganization Committee held its third meeting at the District Office today (26th). Nine people, including Shen Jing and Liu, attended. Matters for discussion: (1) The county government instructed that the allowance for the candidate officers of the County Public Security Bureau should still be allocated by the District Office. It was resolved that the police force would be supplemented in the first, third, and second districts of the city this month. The fourth district is also scheduled to supplement in May. The second district added water patrol boats and used this police fee to purchase them, and there were no remaining funds to allocate. It should be reported to the county government again. (2) The county government instructed to amend the charter of the committee. It was resolved that it seemed to be overstepping the authority of the district to supervise the County Public Security Fund, so it would only supervise the district public security fee. The so-called allocation of police salaries refers to the district police fee. Now the people still have the right to supervise administrative expenses, and the committee members represent the people, so they can supervise them, and there is no need to amend it. It should be reported again. (3) The county government instructed that the expenses of the County Detective Team should still be temporarily maintained by the district. It was resolved that it was indeed inappropriate in nature for the district to allocate the expenses of the County Detective Team. One person should be assigned to each police station in the original number, and two people should be assigned to the station as cooperative detectives in the district, stationed in the police stations and the station to handle affairs. The salary is 8 yuan per month for each person, and the remaining 12 yuan is an allowance for the detectives. At the end of the month, the station will pay the salary according to the name and notify the police stations to check. The Two Commercial Firms Are Bankrupt and Clearing News The Qixin Sauce Garden in this city is a century-old shop. Last year, it owed the village 15,000 yuan, and the deposits and accounts of each household amounted to more than 40,000 yuan. Due to insufficient turnover, it closed down and announced liquidation. The creditors hired a lawyer to sue the county government for provisional attachment and valuation for auction. However, no one bid on the first bid date. The county government entrusted the Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce to handle it. It is now learned that Ding Zhouzhi purchased it for 18,050 yuan. The money will be handed over to the association in installments and dealt with according to the bankruptcy law. It is heard that the creditors of each household will only receive 40% of the compensation, which has been agreed upon. The distribution will be based on the selling price first. However, the village side claims that the 15,000 yuan owed is entitled to priority due to the application for provisional attachment, and requires full payment. However, it is feared that there are still problems in fact. Another case of Xu Chengyuan's bankruptcy. The creditors have distributed 28% of the debt, and both parties have agreed. The Chamber of Commerce has also invited various creditors to deal with it. Suzhou The List of Court Police Examination of the High Court Is Announced The High Court Procuratorate held an examination for court police the day before yesterday (25th). A total of 194 people arrived. Yesterday (26th), the list was announced. Tang Zhifang, Sun Peng, Liu Chunhua, and 21 others were admitted, and it was scheduled to conduct physical examinations at 2:00 PM on the 28th. Fire Brigade Car Kills an Official in Pan District, Eighth Section The Eighth Section of Nanhau Tongshan Fire Brigade recently purchased a new car for firefighting purposes. Some members used the excuse of learning to drive and drove out on the road every day. However, the driver had no experience at all. Knowing people had long expected that it would cause an accident. At around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday (25th), the car was driving through the northern end of Guangji Bridge. When it was going down the bridge, a person riding a bicycle came from Liuyuan Road and was run over by the car, causing serious injuries to the person. He was sent to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 8:00 PM. It was later learned that the deceased's name was Shi Peiquan, 36 years old, from Changzhou. His wife, Zhang, runs the Shishunxing Copper Shop at the entrance of the Tani Lane on Hulong Street. His wife happened to be in the countryside. The shop notified Shi's cousin, Liu Caihua, to go to the countryside. He returned to Suzhou at 1:00 PM yesterday (26th) and went to Suyong Hospital. At 5:30 PM, Lu Yihou, a prosecutor from the Local Court, came to examine the body before it was coffined. After the accident, the passengers in the car all escaped. Only the driver, Shen Delin, was caught and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation that night. The family of the deceased has hired lawyer Wu Chao to handle the legal procedures to wait for a legal resolution. The Water Patrol Team Extorted Soil Dealers The soil dealer "Crooked Head" Wang Rongsheng, No. 38 Tiexianglu Street outside the gate, recently sold six loads of soil. Chen Xiuzhang and Yu Jinzhou, soldiers of the Water Patrol Team of the County Public Security Bureau, learned of this and went to extort him. They extorted 500 yuan in cash and a promissory note for 500 yuan, which was issued by the Yuanda Flour Mill across the street from Wang, which was to be collected on the 25th. After it was discovered by the Director of the County Office, Min Zhongqian, he ordered several plainclothes police officers to wait in a small teahouse on Baoyuan Street. At around 5:00 PM, Chen and Yu went to collect the note and were arrested by the plainclothes police officers and taken to the office. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Director Min sent flying squad soldiers to Wang's house to arrest Wang Rongsheng and detained two related persons and brought them to the office for investigation. The County Finance Bureau Loan Has Been Settled The Wu County Finance Bureau needed 88,000 yuan in expenses and could not raise it. Yesterday, the General Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from the silver and money industries and the real estate industry to a meeting. As a result, they agreed to borrow 70,000 yuan at a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, for a term of six months. The silver and money industries will each take on 25,000 yuan, and the real estate industry will take on 20,000 yuan. The Culong Mountain Robbery Case Killed the Principal Offender In the case of robbery and injury in Culong Mountain, the principal offender was Pan, who specialized in lending money in Shanrenqiao Township. It is now learned that Wang Jinpan, the squad leader of the self-defense regiment in the township, learned the night before yesterday (25th) that Pan was hiding at the house of his mistress near Yayi Mountain, and led a team to arrest him. Because Pan put his hand into his bag to search, it was suspected that he was taking out a gun, so he fired a shot first, hitting Pan's chest and killing him on the spot. Yesterday, he reported the situation to the county for verification. Bandit Ships Discovered on Chefang Lake The county government received a telephone report from the Chefang Public Security Bureau that six or seven bandit ships suddenly appeared on the lake four li away from the town the day before yesterday (25th). Dozens of bandits with long and short guns kidnapped a boatman who was parked there. Magistrate Huang, upon receiving the report, dispatched a team to pursue and suppress them. Wujiang The Shengjia Warehouse Kidnapping Case Was Solved The son of Zhu Jin'an, the owner of Shunchang Cloth Shop at the Shengjia Warehouse Xinqiao Tumu in this city, was kidnapped by bandits on the warehouse behind the Sanmendian Gate in the south of the city this month. Yesterday (24th), Shao Yuanlong, a bandit suppression officer of the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, led an informant and joined the garrison troops to arrest two bandits in the case at the Shengjia Warehouse Teahouse. A pistol was seized on the spot and sent to the 25th Regiment Headquarters for interrogation. They confessed to the kidnapping and extortion. Change of Water Police Captain Zhou Huimin, a native of the county, formerly served as the captain of the Water Public Security Team and the captain of the Police Team in this county. Now Director Hu has specially appointed Zhou Huimin to serve as the captain of the Water Police Team in this county again in order to suppress bandits. Wuxi The Director of the Construction Department Came to Wuxi for Inspection Xu Yifang, a technician of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, who was specially dispatched by the Construction Department to inspect the provincial roads, arrived in Wuxi from Changzhou on the afternoon of the 25th. He went to the county government to pay a visit to County Magistrate Sun and inquired about the situation of the county's conscription of labor to build roads. County Magistrate Sun told Mr. Xu about the current situation of road construction. Mr. Xu said that he saw in the Wuxi newspapers today that your county's conscription of labor to build roads has a tendency to be delayed. This fact violates the intention of the Construction Department. The Construction Department has instructed that the filling of earthwork for conscription of labor may be extended until after the autumn harvest, but this can only be done when it is absolutely necessary. If it is possible to find a way to proceed, it is still based on starting work this month. County Magistrate Sun replied that it is the busy farming season recently. The county government, as the person in charge of the construction of provincial roads in the county, will certainly comply with the instructions of the Construction Department and actively build roads. It is currently persuading the villagers to start work as soon as possible, but there are many practical difficulties. It is best to conscript labor during the villagers' free time so that both the livelihood of the farmers and the laws and regulations of the Construction Department can be taken care of. It is estimated that after the start of the Wuxi-Changzhou section of the road in this county, it can be completed in at most two months. If it is built after the autumn harvest, it can still meet the principle of completing it by the end of this year, as required by the instructions of the Construction Department. Please forward it to the Construction Department, etc. After hearing this, Mr. Xu said that County Magistrate Sun's statement was indeed the actual situation, so he left the office and went to the County Construction Bureau to accompany Director Yao to inspect the provincial road route in Dongting and other areas in order to report the inspection results to the Construction Department for approval. In addition, Zhu Meiji and other nine representatives of the citizens of the eighth and ninth districts petitioned to postpone the construction of the provincial road. The day before yesterday, the representatives heard that Director Xu came to Wuxi for inspection, and still advocated starting work this month, which would harm the livelihood of the people. The group believed that the villagers would be greatly affected. The representatives held a meeting to discuss and decided to take a bus to the province yesterday morning to petition. Nan Yan City, Liu Tan Bridge, Refugees Robbed in Broad Daylight On the upper part of the South Lane of Liu Tan Bridge, 392 Tutu, in the county, eight refugee boats arrived at 12:00 AM the day before yesterday. Eighty or ninety male and female refugees, all speaking with a northern accent, anchored there to cook. Unexpectedly, a part of the refugees (about thirty or more people) landed one after another and flocked to the house of Hua Meixi, a resident of the area, and looted wantonly. It was not until about 3:00 PM that they took the stolen goods back to the original boat and sailed away. After the incident, the owner checked and found that the loss was about 200 yuan. The Verdict of the Yang Shuyuan Murder Case Zhou San, a tenant farmer from Yang Shuyuan, in the northern countryside of the county, was identified as a thief by Xu Baoquan, a villager, in February of this year, and instigated Kuang Renpei, Wang Agen, and others to beat Zhou severely. On the way, Zhou jumped into the river with handcuffs on, resulting in drowning. After the county government arrested Wang Agen, Wu Jiantang, Kuang Renpei, and other six or seven people involved in the case, they were detained, but no verdict has been made yet. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu pronounced the verdict in court, sentencing Kuang Renpei to ten months in prison and Wang Agen to eight months in prison. Wu Jiantang was released on bail.

However, they did not know what the fugitive looked like, making it difficult to investigate. When asked, the master, Guo Chunsen, said that he had a photo of the male servant, Guo Song'an, hanging in the back wing, but after the tragedy, the servant had taken the photo with him when he fled.</p>
<p>The Runaway Servant Guo Song'an</p>
<p>Negative Found in Photography Studio</p>
<p>Subsequently, Guo Cang, Chunsen's nephew, said that the male servant, Song'an, had taken a small four-inch photo at the Nanxin Photography Studio on Jing'an Temple Road in November of last year. Upon hearing this, police detectives immediately went with Guo Cang to the Nanxin Photography Studio to check. Unexpectedly, the studio, which was founded by another Japanese person, was deeply afraid that there might be other circumstances and did not listen to the detectives. For the sake of thorough investigation, the police station immediately notified the Nanxin Photography Studio with an official letter. After receiving the letter, the studio immediately checked the negatives. Guo Chunsen and Guo Cang, the masters of the house, identified the negative, and it was indeed the male servant, Guo Song'an.</p>
<p>Police Distribute Photos to Apprehend the Fugitive</p>
<p>After obtaining the negative of the runaway male servant Guo Song'an (nickname "Guangxi Mapi"), the police station immediately instructed the Nanxin Photography Studio to print two dozen more copies and distribute them to Chinese and Western detectives in various police stations so that they could pay close attention to the case and apprehend the fugitive at any time. Our newspaper has also obtained a photo of Guo Song'an and has made a special plate to publish it. Because the police are eager to know his whereabouts, anyone who has information about his secret residence can report it to the nearest police station.</p>
<p>The Guo Family Moves Out Today</p>
<p>Our reporter, wanting to understand the underlying causes of the incident, drove to the Guo residence in Lane Zhi Deli again last night to inquire. When he arrived at the entrance of the lane, the gloomy wind made him shiver. Although this is a superstitious belief, the psychological effect of being in that place late at night was indeed unsettling. When the reporter entered the Guo residence, he saw two detectives gesticulating and talking, as if they were talking about a tiger changing its color. When asked where the master of the house was, he replied that he had already lodged with relatives at six o'clock the night before and was planning to move the whole family today.</p>
<p>The Court Examined the Corpses Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei to lead clerks, forensic doctors, and others to the corpse examination site on Flandre Road by car to examine the corpses of the seven victims who were killed: (1) Guo Chunsen's wife, Guo Li; (2) daughter-in-law, Liu Yanqiu; (3) grandson, Dasheng; (4) grandson, Meisheng; (5) maid, Gui Xiang; (6) Chun Lian; and (7) cook, Guo Chao Long. They examined the wounds on each of the seven corpses, male and female, young and old, and found that they were all on the neck.</p>
<p>Knife Handle Fingerprints Worth Studying</p>
<p>The Western Head of the Jing'an Temple Police Station then reported that after the incident, he went to the Guo residence to investigate the situation. He said that at 7:30 yesterday morning, the police station received a phone call from Fu Songting reporting a major murder case in Lane Zhi Deli and immediately sent Western Detective Mike Whalen to investigate. According to reports, all the residents of the Guo family, except for the child Su Sheng, were killed. However, the male servant Guo Song'an and a maid named Chonggui were missing. He requested that warrants be issued to detain these two people for questioning or to obtain clues about the case. When he went to the Guo residence to investigate, he found three sharp knives, one a kitchen knife and two axes. One knife and one ax were stained with blood, and there were fingerprints on the knife. He has now handed them over to fingerprint experts for research. He is now bringing an ax to the court for inspection.</p>
<p>This Case May Have Arisen from Adultery</p>
<p>Guo Chunsen's eldest son, Guo Bo, then filed a lawsuit stating the names and identities of the seven people who were killed and then stated that Guo Chao Long (also known as Shao Long) was his cousin and that the runaway Guo Song'an was a distant uncle. He said that he was studying at Fudan University and lived on campus and did not often go home. He did not know how the tragedy occurred, but based on the current situation, he speculated that Song'an and Chonggui may have had an affair, and his mother did not approve of their union, so he resorted to this vicious act, killing seven people and then fleeing. He requested that the two be quickly arrested and punished according to the law.</p>
<p>Bodyguard He's Testimony</p>
<p>Witness Fu Songting testified that he was working as a bodyguard at the home of a Mr. He at No. 94, Avenue Edward VII. At 6:30 yesterday morning, because the maid was dumping the chamber pot at the door, he was also standing at the door to guard the house to prevent bandits from entering. He then saw Guo's child Su Sheng coming out of his house and crying to him, saying that everyone in his house had been killed. He then went to take a look and immediately saw someone who had been killed and reported it to the police. Prosecutor Guo obtained the testimony and determined that the seven corpses of Guo Li and others, male and female, had indeed been slashed to death by the murderer with knives and axes before death. He ordered the family members of the deceased, Guo Bo, to sign a statement and take the coffins back for burial and ordered the police to strictly apprehend the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>Search of the Art University</p>
<p>Seized Printed Matter</p>
<p>Several People Arrested</p>
<p>According to a secret report received by the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Yuan Liang, yesterday afternoon, a large number of reactionaries were hiding in the Shanghai Art University at No. 85, Rue Cardinal Mercier, in the French Concession, plotting reaction. Director Yuan, after receiving the report, immediately ordered the Supervisory Office to handle the matter properly. The Supervisory Office sent personnel with an official letter to the French General Police Department. After hearing the news, Police Commissioner Favalet immediately ordered the Chief of Political Affairs, Sarli, to gather a fully armed guard of 40 men and lead all the Chinese and Western detectives to the address provided by the Public Security Bureau personnel for a thorough inspection. A large number of reactionary books and printed matter were seized on the spot, and 40 male and female students were arrested and taken to the police station to await interrogation in court.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Money Criminals Arrested in Dance Hall</p>
<p>Well-dressed... Extravagant Behavior</p>
<p>Using Counterfeit Money... Arrested as a Result</p>
<p>According to the Wenhui Daily, a Chinese expatriate with American citizenship, surnamed Wu, was arrested in the dance hall of the Great Eastern Hotel last night (the 25th) for allegedly using a counterfeit 100-dollar bill from the Hong Kong Mercantile Bank. According to the police and bank officials, the arrest of this person is extremely important because this type of 100-dollar counterfeit bill is so well-made that it is almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The bank has been investigating this matter since the autumn of last year and has only now arrested one person. These counterfeit bills are all imitations of bills issued by the Hong Kong branch. The bank had instructed all branches to temporarily collect all 100-dollar genuine bills issued in Hong Kong for safekeeping to facilitate investigation. Although the counterfeit bills are well-made, there is still one flaw that is easily detectable by bank staff but not easily recognizable by the general public, so they are widely circulated. The origin of the case is that the Chinese expatriate went to the Perrier Hotel on Avenue Edward VII with a dance hostess on Thursday night and presented a counterfeit 100-dollar bill. The waiter took it to a nearby money shop to exchange it and returned with 90 dollars. The next day, the money shop notified the hotel because the bank would not exchange the bill. A Chinese staff member in the hotel knew the dance hostess and, after much investigation, obtained her whereabouts and reported it to the police, who arrested him in the dance hall of the Great Eastern Hotel at night. At the time, the defendant was still drinking with the dance hostess and two Germans at the same table. Although nothing was found on the defendant's person, two counterfeit bills were found in the dance hostess's handkerchief. When questioned about their origin, she said that she got them from a small village near Hong Kong and had only been in Shanghai for six days. He was dressed in a very fashionable Western suit, spoke English with an American accent, and claimed to live in San Francisco, so he had obtained a passport from that city. He was immediately taken to the American Concession this morning. After a detailed investigation by Prosecutor Sallards and discussions with the Consul General and Concession staff, he refused to accept the trial, so the defendant will be brought to the Special District Local Court for questioning on Monday.</p>
<p>Voronoff Talks About Youth Gland Results</p>
<p>Leaves Shanghai Tomorrow, Returns Next Year</p>
<p>Professor Voronoff, Director of the Experimental Surgery School and Deputy Director of the Physiological Chemistry School of Paris High School, arrived in Shanghai from France a few days ago. Voronoff is famous in the global medical community for his invention of the youth gland. By grafting the youth gland of monkeys into the human body, people can rejuvenate. According to Voronoff, since he invented this technique in 1920, he and other surgeons have achieved remarkable results. Only 8% of the operations have failed. Those who have received this gland are generally 20 years younger in spirit and energy. The effects take three months to develop. The first sensation is vigorous spirit. However, after five to eight years, the effects gradually diminish, and a new gland must be grafted, and the effects are still the same. He has performed this procedure twice on more than 100 people. However, there is no one who has had the procedure done a third time, so he cannot comment on its effectiveness. The gland grafting operation is very simple. Men only need one gland, while women need three glands: the reproductive gland, the thyroid gland, and another gland. He experimented on monkeys behind closed doors for about ten years before he dared to introduce the technique to the world. He plans to go to the United States to lecture and demonstrate this technique. He will leave Shanghai on Sunday. He has given lectures in Bombay at the invitation of the British government and in Hanoi, Saigon, and Siam at the invitation of the French government. After touring the United States, he plans to return to Paris and then come back to the East, first to Japan and then to Shanghai to lecture and demonstrate surgery. The date is scheduled for around June 1931.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Restricts Savings Business</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has strict restrictions on financial institutions conducting savings business. All banks that specialize in or concurrently conduct this business must obtain approval before they can operate, in order to protect the safety of depositors and consolidate the livelihoods of ordinary people. However, in recent years, many ordinary stores in various provinces and cities have also been falsely operating savings businesses, especially in Shanghai, where there are a wide variety of ways to do this. They have not been approved and registered, and the amount of their funds and how they are used are unknown. What they absorb is the lifeblood of the people. If there is a collapse, the number of victims would be countless. This is a matter of great importance to social security and the people's livelihood. It is our duty to thoroughly investigate and prohibit this. The Shanghai Banking Association also believes that Shanghai's merchants are competing to conduct savings business as a way to attract business, and the publicity advertisements are everywhere. It has become a trend. The actual protection is difficult to predict. The public, without understanding the content, invests deposits of tens of millions of dollars. If there is any negligence, it will harm the livelihoods of ordinary people and cause great harm. The Association has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to restrict the reckless operation of savings business. The Ministry of Finance believes that the points raised by the Association are all insightful and have requested the Shanghai Special Municipality to investigate and deal with the matter and has also sent letters to the concession authorities and the Special District Local Court to thoroughly investigate and prohibit this. It is reported that the Municipal Government has sent letters to the American and French Consuls General and the Special District Local Court and has instructed its subordinates to investigate and prohibit this.</p>
<p>The Kidnapper Never Forgets Money Before Execution</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers Executed Yesterday</p>
<p>One Kidnapper Asks to Give His Savings to His Brother</p>
<p>Savings Book with Over 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Other Two Kidnappers Only Want a Good Meal</p>
<p>The kidnappers Chen Changgen from Yangzhou, Fan Renbao from Ningbo, and Li Lisheng from Pudong, who repeatedly committed kidnapping cases against Feng Yixiang and others, were captured by the Xinzha Police Station and sentenced to death by the former Provisional Court. After being approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government for execution, the Special District Local Court ordered the police station to escort the prisoners to the court yesterday afternoon. At 2:00 p.m., Judge Cheng ascended the bench and asked the prisoners if they had any last words. Li Lisheng first said that there was no need to notify his family to avoid trouble but asked to be given food and drink. Chen Changgen then said that he had a current account book with the Day and Night Bank with 600 yuan in the name of Chen Yating and a current account book with Wing On Company with 1,700 yuan. After he was arrested, they were copied and stored in the police station. There was also a box of clothes and redwood furniture stored in the police station. He asked if his brother Chen Yongcai could collect them so that his family could make a living. Fan Renbao said that he had nothing else to say but asked for a good meal. Judge Cheng approved Chen Changgen's request, stating that all items stored by Chen Changgen that were not expressly confiscated in the judgment could be collected by his brother Chen Yongcai. He then ordered the detectives to escort the three prisoners to the Caohejing Prison Execution Ground. Prosecutor Wang Shixian was appointed by the Local Court as the supervising officer. Police Chief Yang Deshan and Police Sergeant Chen Xihui supervised the bailiffs Wang Jianqing, Zhu Wanyuan, Xu Guoguang, and Cai Zuoqing to the execution ground. After the judge ascended the bench, he ordered the execution. Police Chief Yang directed the executioners Gu Hanqing and Yin Dao Xu to execute the three prisoners by firing squad. The corpses were taken by the court for collection and awaiting claim.</p>
<p>Five Kidnappers Arrested in Hotel</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Water Police Provincial Public Security Team and detectives from the First District, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the Old Zha Police Station, arrested five major kidnappers from Pudong—Jin Wenfu, Wang Ruiqing, Monk Huang, Gu Linhai, and Gu Pinsan—at Rooms 11 and 12 of the Xin Gao Sheng Hotel at No. 170 Guangdong Road yesterday morning. The Water Police believed that these five were important criminals who needed to be brought to justice, so they were escorted by the police station to the Special District Local Court. After a trial by Judge Xu Jashi, they were handed over to be escorted away and brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<p>Suspicious Conversation Between Two People</p>
<p>Related to the Kidnapping of a Three-Year-Old Child</p>
<p>Arrested by the Pengpu Security Corps</p>
<p>The Two Strongly Deny Being Bandits</p>
<p>The Fourth District Public Security Bureau of Zhabei yesterday handed over a case of conspiracy to kidnap a boy by the Second Team of the Pengpu Township Security Corps. Director Jin inquired about the case, and the plaintiff, Ms. He Zhang, from Yancheng, who lived at No. 114 Xizang Road in the Public Concession, stated that her nine-year-old daughter, Da Maotou, was holding her three-year-old grandson, Jinsheng, when they went out for a stroll on the morning of the 23rd of this month. Unexpectedly, when they were walking through the intersection of Kaifeng Road, two people suddenly rushed out, both wearing black long gowns and tall and thin figures, blocking their way and snatching the child she was holding and fleeing. Her daughter was young and panicked and did not dare to shout until they had disappeared into the distance before returning home to tell her. She immediately reported the case to the Xinzha Police Station to request an arrest. After days passed without any news, she became extremely anxious and hired people to search everywhere, hoping to get her grandson back. Yesterday, her acquaintances, Chen Maochang and Wang Xingwu, were passing by Pingjiang Bridge in Zhabei when they saw two people in front of them looking flustered and followed them. Suddenly, they heard them say, "The small bucket is not important, but the big bucket knowing is terrible." (The small bucket refers to Zhang's husband, and the big bucket refers to Zhang's husband's older brother.) Chen and Wang became even more suspicious after hearing this and followed them closely, witnessing them entering the home of the defendant Wu Tingchen. They then returned to tell her and immediately reported to the Pengpu Township Security Corps and ordered many corps members to go there. The defendant Xu Zhang's feelings were weak, and he jumped out of the window to escape but was immediately arrested. Wu was also taken to the corps and ordered to reveal the two kidnappers and hand over her grandson, but he was still evasive. Please verify. According to the testimonies of He, Chen, and others, they did see two people walking into Wu's house and talking about kidnapping Ms. He Zhang's grandson. When Wu Tingchen was questioned, he said that he was from Yancheng and ran the Changxing Tea Garden on Pingjiang Bridge. Yesterday, only his uncle Wu Huaidao and neighbor Li Sanbao came to his house to collect debts. Suddenly, the security corps arrived. The tenant Xu Zhang did not know what was happening and fled out the window. He was a law-abiding businessman and had no improper behavior. Xu Zhang also testified that he was from Yangzhou and rented a room from Wu and worked as a helper at the Wang family on Pingjiang Bridge. Last night, he saw the plaintiff Ms. He Zhang and others leading many people, each holding a handgun, storming into his house. He was extremely frightened and ran away, but there was no other reason. Director Jin verified the testimonies and believed that although Wu and others did not admit to kidnapping Zhang's grandson, there was proof from Chen and Wang that they were highly suspicious and should be taken to the bureau for questioning.</p>

<p>Eighteen-Year-Old Daughter Seduced and Abandoned</p>
<p>Wang Lincheng Accuses Zheng Xiaochu of Two Crimes</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaochu Has a Beautiful Wife and Concubines</p>
<p>Why Take a Female Waiter as a Concubine?</p>
<p>Defendant's Lawyer Asks for the Case to be Dismissed</p>
<p>Wang Lincheng yesterday hired lawyer Gu Jirong as his representative to accuse Zheng Xiaochu in the French court, claiming that Zheng Xiaochu seduced the plaintiff's daughter, Wang Gendi (18 years old), in 1927. The plaintiff later found out, and since the deed was done, he allowed her to be Zheng Xiaochu's concubine. She gave birth to a daughter last year, and the previous engagement of Gendi was terminated. They intended to live together until they grew old. Unexpectedly, Zheng Xiaochu suddenly changed his mind on March 7th of this year, feigning diligence and instructing Gendi to return to Ningbo on the pretext of abandoning her. Such circumstances show that Zheng Xiaochu has committed the crime of luring away a minor under Article 257 of the Criminal Law and the crime of abandonment under Article 310. He requested that the two crimes be investigated and that 5,000 yuan in alimony be recovered. The defendant, represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, argued that Wang Gendi, the plaintiff's daughter, worked as a hostess in the New World in 1927. The defendant was a ticket seller for a certain opera house and went to the New World to perform, which led to him meeting Gendi. They exchanged affectionate glances. Although they often met later, there was no physical relationship. However, Gendi had repeatedly borrowed money from the defendant. Although the defendant had lent her some money, there was never a close relationship. Unexpectedly, when the defendant returned to Shanghai from Qingdao last year, Wang Gendi and her mother came to the defendant's place and falsely claimed that Gendi was pregnant and falsely accused the defendant of being the father. At that time, the defendant was surprised and had a slight dispute and then left. Since then, there has been little communication. The defendant has a beautiful wife and concubines who are present in court, so why would he take a female waiter as a concubine? The law cited by the plaintiff's lawyer is not only inapplicable but also ridiculous in this case. The defendant did not fall in love with Gendi, so how can the crime of luring away a minor be established? The crime of abandonment is even more absurd. Since there was no formal marriage contract, how can this article of law be applied? The accusation is without evidence, and the lawyer requested that the case be dismissed. Judge Zhu asked Wang Gendi, "Have you ever lived with the defendant?" Wang Gendi replied, "The woman has never worked as a female waiter in the New World. The first time I was in a room with the defendant was at the Anle Palace Hotel. Later, the defendant came with his concubine to pick me up and lived in his concubine's house for several days before he drove me home." Judge Cheng ordered everyone to leave and await judgment.</p>
<p>Detectives Cao Xirong's Home Visited by Robbers</p>
<p>Detective Cao Returns Home to Find Robbery in Progress</p>
<p>Gunfire Exchanged at First Sight</p>
<p>One Robber Wounded and Escapes with Accomplices</p>
<p>Detective Cao Also Injured in Right Arm and Forehead</p>
<p>Fourteen People Arrested That Night</p>
<p>At around 7:00 p.m. the night before last, six robbers armed with weapons broke into the home of Cao Xirong at No. 288, Qingyun Lane, Zhaojia Road, and robbed Cao's wife, Ms. Wu, of a gold bracelet, three gold rings, and a gold watch. They were about to steal more items when Cao returned home from outside. The robbers opened fire. Cao, who is a detective at the Huishan Police Station, was carrying a firearm and immediately returned fire, wounding one robber. The wounded robber and his accomplices escaped. Cao was injured in the right arm and forehead. Afterwards, the Harbin Police Station sent detectives to take Cao to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. That night, the police arrested 14 men and women from Jiangbei at No. 92 Harbin Road, No. 1354 East Jiaxing Road, and No. 82 Yuanfang Road, including Zhou Yiwen, Yan Bao Cai, Li Xiao Er Zi, Wen Da Gu Zi, Dai Wen Cheng, Yu Xiao Quan, Xu Da Gui Zi, Wang Da Si Zi, and women Zhang Xing Shi, Zhang Sang Shi, Zhang Shi Shi, Zhou Ding Shi, Dai Cai Shi, and Li Wang Shi. A pistol, 197 bullets, and five shell casings were found at the home of Wang Da Si Zi on Rue Eugène. One of the robbers, Wen Da Gu Zi, was the one who was shot by Detective Cao and was transferred to the hospital by the police. The remaining 13 people were escorted to the Special District Local Court yesterday morning. Judge Ge questioned them. Cao's wife, Ms. Wu, stated that she was in the room at the time when she saw four robbers entering, each threatening her with a pistol, and she was robbed of the jewelry she was wearing. Her husband returned home from the police station and exchanged gunfire with the robbers. She only recognized the two robbers, Yan Bao Cai and Li Xiao Er Zi, as being present at the scene. Yan供 stated that there were six accomplices, including Zhou Yiwen and Zhang Xing Shi, who were acting as lookouts outside. He, Li Xiao Er Zi, Wen Da Gu Zi, and one who escaped entered the house to rob. Judge Ge ordered the defendants to be detained separately and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<p>Rampant Banditry in the Interior</p>
<p>Cocoon Merchants Prepare for Trouble</p>
<p>Petition the National Government for Protection</p>
<p>Discuss Insurance Measures</p>
<p>The spring silkworms in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to have their third sleep, and the late ones have already had their second sleep. All the funds for purchasing cocoons from local silk cocoon merchants must be prepared in advance. However, due to the unrest in various counties in the interior, foreign insurance companies have increased the premiums for various types of insurance for cocoon funds, including water, fire, theft, war, and banditry, to about double the original amount. The premium discount is too large, and the silk cocoon industry is difficult to accept. The procedures for protecting the cocoon market in various regions have been submitted to the National Government's military and civilian departments by the silk cocoon industry association, requesting that military police be dispatched to each county's cocoon market to be responsible for effective protection. For the transportation of silver, there are shallow-water gunboats and师船枪划 on the waterways, and armed military police accompany the escort on the land routes to prevent bandits from taking advantage of any opportunities. It is found that the special chapters for insurance companies to underwrite cocoon funds were established in the 16th year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty. More than 50 years have passed, and the situation has changed greatly. It is necessary to renegotiate the standards for insurance premiums and insurance chapters in order to comply with them. The Shanghai Silk Factory Association has received a reply from the foreign insurance companies, scheduling a board meeting at 10:00 a.m. on the 28th of this month (Monday) at No. 17 The Bund, i.e., the building above the North China Daily News, requesting representatives to attend and discuss a proper plan for mutual compliance. The silk factory association has publicly elected Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, and Wu Shenbo, three standing committee members, to attend the meeting on the scheduled date to discuss a proper plan for mutual compliance.</p>

<p>Zhabei Water Problem</p>
<p>Municipal Government Stipulates Measures</p>
<p>Three Bureaus Jointly Issue a Proclamation</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute over water meter installation in Zhabei, since the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and various parties involved have discussed four measures, a small number of property owners still hold different opinions. In order to avoid water outages, the Municipal Public Security, Social Affairs, and Public Utilities Bureaus have jointly issued the following proclamation: Regarding the joint issuance of a proclamation, the Zhabei water meter installation dispute has been discussed and agreed upon by the Municipal Government, the Party Department, and relevant parties, and four compromise measures have been announced and implemented. However, a small number of property owners still hold different opinions and have not paid the water bills owed to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, which often leads to water outages or litigation. The Bureaus have now received an order from the Municipal Government that if there are property owners who owe water bills and are involved in litigation, before a resolution is reached, the tenants should deduct the rent and hand it over to the Public Security Bureau for safekeeping, and the water company should continue to supply water as usual. As for the implementation measures: (1) The Public Security Bureau will order the tenants to hand over the rent to the Bureau within a time limit. If they fail to do so, the Bureau will send police to collect it on their behalf. If they still delay, the water company will be allowed to stop the supply. (2) If the tenant fails to pay the rent due (except for cases where the rent increase dispute has not been resolved) for two months, the property owner may apply to the district office to send police to assist in the collection. If they fail to pay for three months, the property owner may apply to the district office to order the resident to move out, but the property owner must not use stopping the water supply as a threat. It is hereby jointly announced that, in the future, if tenants encounter property owners who owe water bills and are involved in litigation with the water company, or if property owners encounter tenants who owe rent, they should follow the aforementioned measures stipulated by the Municipal Government and must not violate them. This proclamation is issued to ensure that flammable items are stored properly to prevent fires.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Proclaims to Prevent Fires</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: Regarding the matter of the Shanghai South District Fire Department reporting that Xia Qi, the director of the West District, reported that on the 15th of this month, the Gan family at No. 4 Ankang Lane, Caojia Lane, was negligent, causing a fire that burned down the entire three-story building, injuring two men and women and killing three people. After a detailed inspection, it was found that a large number of films were stored upstairs and downstairs. The fire was caused by the films. Because the original quality of the films is similar to rosin, it is easy to catch fire, and the breath is very 民渐利害, which affects the sense of smell and causes abnormal depression in the brain. It can be seen that the three members of the Zhang surname family were suffocated by the breath, resulting in this tragedy. It is believed that this type of chemical substance similar to rosin is easy to catch fire, and a slight carelessness can cause great harm. It is requested to strictly prohibit this in order to protect public safety. After investigating the reports of the Department, it is found that what they saw is true. In addition to issuing a notice to subordinates and instructing them to be aware, it is also necessary to issue a proclamation to all citizens to inform them that, in the future, these dangerous items that are easy to burn should be stored carefully to prevent accidents from occurring. All must abide by this.</p>
<p>Public Works Department</p>
<p>Former Board Member Lyman Passed Away Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Evening News, Lyman, a former American board member of the Public Works Department, was admitted to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment after suffering from neurasthenia in February. Although his condition had not improved much in the past seven weeks, it was not dangerous. However, it suddenly worsened last night and suddenly passed away this morning (the 26th) at the age of 63, leaving behind his wife and one son and one daughter. Lyman came to China 30 years ago and had long served at the Standard Oil Company. He retired in 1927 due to old age and devoted himself to the affairs of the Public Works Department and the Chamber of Commerce. The funeral is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. tomorrow at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery.</p>
<p>Police Arrested Criminals This Week</p>
<p>According to the Evening News, the Public Concession Police arrested a total of 272 criminals this week, including three armed robbers, ten pickpockets, and eight thieves.</p>
<p>Anti-Russian Joint Office Scams Money</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Rutang recently received a letter and donation book from the Anti-Russian Joint Office asking for donations. The donation book listed the Shanghai County Government and the Provisional Court and other institutions and was affixed with the Jiangsu Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Bureau. It was questioned whether this was true, so the director of the Shanghai office, Chen Shiguang, was ordered to investigate and report the matter. Director Chen then ordered the clerk Miao Wenyi to conduct a field investigation and learned that the Shanghai County Government and the Provisional Court and other institutions all claimed that they did not know about it. He then went to the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau to investigate. According to Clerk Luo, he did not know about it. Clerk Miao questioned him why he was affixed with a stamp, and Luo君 replied that someone had brought the donation book to the dispatch office and that they naturally affixed a return stamp after receiving the item. This Anti-Russian Joint Office is obviously scamming money under false pretenses, and all the institutions are unaware of it. It is not known whether the matter should be thoroughly investigated. It is reported that Director Chen has submitted the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review and compliance.</p>

<p>A ferry owned by Zhang Sanlang, carrying 29 men and women passengers, overturned in the waters of Xiangjian Port outside Wusong at around 8:30 a.m. yesterday. When it passed through the area, it suddenly encountered a hurricane followed by a huge wave. The ferry lost its ability to navigate and overturned. All the passengers fell into the water and cried for help on the sea. Fortunately, water police and patrol boats of the anti-smuggling camp were stationed nearby and rushed to the scene to rescue them after hearing the cries. Twenty-six men and women passengers, including Xu Changshun, Bao Qiuyan, and Jin Fan, had not ingested much water and were fortunate enough to survive. However, three people were still missing and could not be found after a thorough search. They are presumed to have joined the water god. Efforts are now being made to recover their bodies.</p>
<p>All Butchers in Lannidu Request</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau to Establish a Slaughterhouse</p>
<p>More than 20 butchers in Lannidu, Pudong, publicly elected Xu Feng, Zhang Jingtao, and Huang Tao Tao as representatives to submit a request to the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau yesterday, requesting permission to establish a slaughterhouse in order to emphasize hygiene and sympathize with the merchants. They stated that there are more than 20 butcher shops in the entire territory of Lannidu. Usually, each family must go to the slaughterhouses in the neighboring towns of Tangqiao or Yangjing to slaughter pigs. Lannidu is very far from both places. As summer approaches, it is difficult to transport the meat along the way, which is detrimental to hygiene. Compared to the three places, Tangqiao has only seven butcher shops, Yangjing has only thirteen, while Lannidu has more than 20. The population of Lannidu is much larger than that of Tangqiao and Yangjing. In terms of location, Lannidu is adjacent to P濱, which is the gateway to Pudong. There are many factories, and the residents of both the waterway and land are very dense. It is necessary to establish another slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>Will Fill the History of This Century</p>
<p>Various Asian Civilizations Will Be Further Consolidated</p>
<p>So-Called Western Civilization Will Be Challenged</p>
<p>Remarks by Italian Reporter Gandar</p>
<p>Rome News, Italian Gerachia magazine recently published an article written by Gandar Signor Gayda, detailing the awakening of India, discussing various aspects of the Indian anti-British movement, and the attitude of Britain separately, briefly stating that Britain's resistance to India is gradually becoming difficult, and the policies taken by London are very panicked. It goes on to say, (Moreover, the British bureaucracy is old and exhausted, unable to invigorate, and its greatest weakness lies in the fact that Britain's prestige has lost its center of gravity in the balance of India.) It also says, (The supporters of Indian anti-Britishism are not Moscow, but the United States and Germany.) It is said that (in this Indian issue, one thing can be asserted, that is, the awakening of India alone will fill the history of this century. The awakening of India will make the unity of Asian nations closer, and the various civilizations of Asia will be further consolidated, because each country in Asia has its commonalities. These civilizations are numerically stronger and more sincere in conscience, and will challenge what we call Western civilization today.)</p>

<p>Opposition Generals Display Their Eloquence</p>
<p>Almost Making the Government Unable to Answer</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th The House of Peers continued to hold its main meeting this morning. After deliberating on the law to prevent theft, it entered the question and answer session. The House of Representatives did not hold a meeting in the afternoon because of the Cherry Blossom Viewing Meeting. In the main meeting the day after tomorrow, Ozaki Yukio will be at the forefront, attacking the government. Whether it is Oyama Ikuo, the communist general who won the seat with public expectations, other aspects also hope that his questioning speech will take the unemployment problem and the police law to the stage, and wield his spicy and passionate debate.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th In the question and answer battle of the plenary session of the House of Peers on the 25th, Tokubo Kishichi, an elder of the Seiyukai, stood at the forefront and raised the issue of Minister of Education Kobyashi. After questioning the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister immediately took the stage and said that Mr. Tokubo regarded the Kobyashi issue as the same as the Ohkuma incident. In fact, although the two incidents seem similar in form, their contents are completely different. The Ohkuma incident occurred during the Ohkuma Cabinet, while the Kobyashi issue arose during the previous cabinet and has nothing to do with the current cabinet. Moreover, although the preliminary trial of Kobyashi's matter has been decided, it is still before the public trial. It is unreasonable to give him responsibility. As for the matter related to Kobyashi, no one knew about it at the time of the formation of the cabinet, and I knew nothing about it at all. He sang his responsibility avoidance theory. Tokubo believed that he was not satisfied and took the stage again, saying that the Prime Minister's answer was an irresponsible answer, which was surprising. The Minister of Education of the Minister of Education's Office has caused a criminal defendant incident, which is an unprecedented ominous event. The Prime Minister wanted to use clever words to shirk his responsibility, covering up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand, which is not advisable for the Prime Minister. If such issues are taken lightly, what is the meaning of cleaning up discipline? From the perspective of the issue of discipline, question the Prime Minister's responsibility, saying thousands of words, blaming the Prime Minister for being shameless, and the Prime Minister only answered that the answer has been exhausted before, and remained silent. Then, Takegoshi Yosaburo took the stage and questioned the Minister of Finance on the issue of the gold standard. The Minister of Finance stood up and said that in order to restore the financial world, there is no other way than the gold standard. In order to reverse the trade deficit, there is no other way than for the people of the country to practice frugality. He also cited detailed figures to strongly support the austerity policy. Takegoshi reserved the right to ask questions again and adjourned the meeting. However, Tokubo's theory of the Prime Minister's responsibility made the Prime Minister quite embarrassed.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 26th In the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 25th, after the speeches of the three ministers, including Prime Minister Hamaguchi, were completed at 4 pm, the questioning began. Chairman Fujisawa introduced Inukai, the president of the Seiyukai, to take the stage. The whole audience was silent. Mr. Inukai said that the 70% claim is the unanimous claim of Japanese naval experts, who believe that it is the minimum limit of national defense. However, Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Foreign Minister Shidehara recognized the compromise reached in London as appropriate and publicly stated that this is sufficient national defense, while the Chief of Naval Staff stated that he could not bear the responsibility of the current national defense (the applause of the Seiyukai was thunderous). The government said that the surplus financial resources generated by the military reduction will be used for tax reduction, but according to the explanation of the Foreign Minister, this agreement is a short-term agreement until 1936. After this year, Japan has to build ships to implement the 70% claim. If this is the case, then the surplus financial resources of the military reduction are temporary financial resources, and there is absolutely no way to carry out permanent tax reduction with temporary financial resources. Is this not the government's deceptive policy? (The financial and people's parties exchanged harsh words, and the parliament was in turmoil.) Inukai further criticized the government's various policies and finally mentioned the issue of Minister of Education Kobyashi's奏請, saying that this will be questioned by Mr. Ozaki Yukio. Inukai stepped down, Prime Minister Hamaguchi took the stage to answer, saying that Mr. Inukai said that as a result of the London Treaty, the guarantee of national defense could not be obtained. This is Mr. Inukai's personal arbitrary decision (the voice of漫骂 from the財政友會 never stopped). The Prime Minister's speech on the stage could not thoroughly議場. Then the parliament was slightly quiet. The Prime Minister refuted each point of Mr. Inukai's attack and stepped down. There were several back-and-forth questions and answers between the two, all with整然 reasons, presenting a magnificent view of two tigers fighting. The listening audience was greatly satisfied. Then the parliament announced a休憩. Not long after, it reopened. Ichiro Hatoyama of the Seiyukai took the stage and first attacked the Prime Minister, saying that the Prime Minister signed the London Treaty regardless of the opposition of the Chief of Naval Staff, which infringed upon the right of command and blamed him for improper measures. He then listed the facts of election interference and attacked Interior Minister Adachi and stepped down. Prime Minister Hamaguchi took the stage and said that Mr. Hatoyama pointed out the government's internal disunity on military reduction. This is based on Mr. Hatoyama's hypothetical judgment and is not the fact at all. Then Interior Minister Adachi took the stage and said that Mr. Hatoyama has repeatedly said that the government interfered in the election. In fact, the government has always respected freedom of speech. Any improper behavior, regardless of party, will be severely punished. This is unanimously recognized by the various speech agencies. He launched a counterattack against Hatoyama's attack and questions. After that, there were several simple disputes between the two over (interference) and (non-interference). At 4:40 pm, the remaining agenda was postponed. Chairman Fujisawa announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th Newspapers carried an anonymous naval figure's paper, criticizing Foreign Minister Baron Shidehara's speech in Parliament yesterday, saying that Shidehara deliberately misinterpreted the impact of the London Naval Treaty on Japanese defense and falsely claimed that he had fully considered the opinions of naval personnel before accepting the treaty, which was tantamount to deceiving oneself and others. The newspapers also carried the news that Admiral Kato was about to resign to express his opposition to the signing of the London Naval Treaty, but this statement cannot be verified yet.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 26th According to the report issued by the Shipbuilding Industry Association today, the first quarter before the end of March this year was a bad era for the British shipbuilding industry in recent years. British shipyards did not receive any transaction orders in this quarter, accounting for 50%. No one ordered cargo ships or oil tankers. The warship projects in private shipyards are now only half of what they were a year ago. Most of the crew members who were under construction at the end of March have completed their work.

<p>National Society, Berlin, 25th Tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of Hindenburg's election as president. Today, all newspapers have lengthy articles. For example, the German World News of the conservative faction stated that April 26, 1925, must not only be regarded as the time of the creation of the republic, but also as the day when the German revival began. Since then, Germany's dignity has grown day by day in the international community. The National Power Party's newspapers, including those who recently opposed Hindenburg, praised the president's great personality and the fairness of his handling of affairs. Even the newspapers of the Democratic Party also said that under the president's handling of national affairs, the Republican Party who opposed his election in the past has been able to reduce their fears.</p>

<p>Rumors Have Not Subsided... People's Hearts are Agitated</p>
<p>The hard trend in the yarn market is still flat. Some manufacturers have received more than 10,000 bales this month, which has agitated people's hearts. In addition, rumors of labor unrest are rampant, and the situation is becoming more pronounced. However, sellers in the far month still have no intention of空扒, so the rising trend is slightly flat, and there is currently no major change.</p>

<p>The Market is Rumored That East Cotton Will Be Shorted in the Near Term</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly softer because American cotton is tending to fall, and people's hearts feel tired. Moreover, it is said in the商场 that East cotton is a short position in May and June, so people's interest is even weaker. However, the attitudes of the Han gangs are still hard. Due to rumors of labor unrest last month, scattered households拋出 and were tired. In short, the底货 is thinner than last year, and the factories still lack transactions of this flower due to the need for印花.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Continues to Fall by One Coin The opening of the Han Standard pre-market was still firm, but afterwards, scattered households sold out, and the situation was softer, falling by five cents to one coin.

<p>Cotton Field Estimates Reduced by Approximately 2.6 Percent</p>
<p>A New York dispatch on the cotton market for the past week reports: The cotton market initially weakened due to profit-taking by longs, but soon rebounded due to short covering. There are reports of continued drought in West Texas, leading to significant buying interest in new crop futures for all months. Other than that, the weather conditions are generally satisfactory. According to a local expert, cotton field estimates are reduced by approximately 2.6 percent. It is also estimated that 78 percent of cotton fields have been planted, compared to 83 percent last year. The New York Cotton Exchange estimates that total cotton stocks (including linters) as of March 31 were 7,036,000 bales, compared to 5,740,000 bales at the same time last year. On this basis, the carryover of old crop from this season is approximately 3,800,000 to 4,200,000 bales. Weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3 id="e72">Grains: Rice Market Dull and Soft <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday's supply was very scarce, around the 10th grade or so. Sales were extremely dull. Northern粳 rice especially was sluggish in movement. Except for high-grade 粳 rice, medium and lower grades were soft. Market sentiment was quite depressed, mainly because retailers and wholesalers were cautious, and sellers were eager to sell, possibly leading to further price declines. Boiled rice with high price was tired, arrivals were weak, and transactions were few. The arrival of Yangdu rice boats was lacking, and stocks were depleted, making the rice market very quiet. Prices were barely stable. Currently, the market's imports and exports are mostly from factories' and warehouses' existing stocks. The white yuan buyers are not interested in accumulating goods. The market is downstream. High-grade goods opened at $18.34.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Riverboats continued to arrive sparsely, and buying interest was quiet. 常錫蘇同 and various machine-milled 粳 rice remained mediocre due to weak demand, slow retail sales, and abundant stocks of middle-grade rice. Therefore, the trend showed stable high-grade prices and softer middle-grade prices. The market outlook was small, nearly stagnant. Southern boiled rice and early rice remained stable. There were few inquiries on this street, and no buying interest from outside merchants, making it feel even more sluggish. Yangdu尖熼 rice was consistently declining. All parties were focusing on foreign rice, making the whole day's rice market extremely uncertain. Circulation remained mediocre. The silver yuan market was slightly tight. Middle-grade opened at $17.12.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Sunny Weather Causes Sharp Drop in Flour Market <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market fell sharply, especially for the current month's delivery. Foreign wheat prices dropped by $0.45, and sales were extremely sluggish. For example,兵船 brand flour was only sold directly to Tianjin in plain packaging. The cold market conditions were already very clear. In addition, the number of short positions held by small and medium-sized mills was still significant. If prices did not fall, they would have to deliver physical goods, further pressuring the market. The market had already lost its ability to resist. For distant months, such as May and June, it was rumored that 阜豐 released a lot of positions. With the sunny weather and declining market sentiment, prices frequently dropped. Observing the subsequent steps, if the weather does not change, the longs' misfortune may begin from here. As a result, the current month's price fell to a low of 2 liang, 5 qian, 0 fen, 7 li, 5 hao, a decrease of 2 fen, 2 li, 5 hao compared to the previous day. May, June, and July each fell by 1 fen, and August and September each fell by a little over 1 fen, 2 li.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Foreign Firms Dump Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Futures <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Numerous Spot Transactions...Totaling Over 80,000</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the foreign rice market was quite good. In the afternoon, after foreign firms dumped large quantities of futures, the market immediately felt the impact. Spot prices fell by a small amount, nearly a 角, and futures prices each fell by several 分. However, trading volume was active in both spot and futures. In addition to local and inland Zhejiang routes, large quantities of spot goods were also shipped to Chaozhou and Shantou. The total amount sold was between 16,000 and 17,000. Saigon No. 1 was priced at $16, small絞 rice at $15.21 to $15.12, large絞 rice at $15.18 to $15.05, Min Dang rice at $15.19, and Su粳 rice at $16.05. In addition, there were 10,000小絞 rice shipments of Min Dang茄拉地 and other brown rice grades, with spot prices at $15.10. 5,500 tons of futures were offered, including 3,500 tons of small絞 rice, 1,000 tons of 皮隆榮 brown rice, and 500 tons each of Min Dang small絞 rice. All were offered by foreign firms. However, because foreign firms dumped large quantities, the market was significantly impacted.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Wheat Prices Will Hardly Rise Again <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures dropped sharply across the board. The current month was one of the final trading days. Although it was reported that actual deliveries were around 50 carts, those wanting to deliver still waited for higher prices to deliver. The market's inability to rise further seemed to be obstructed by some obstacle. For distant months, the weather was good, so the longs could not recover, and the shorts took the opportunity to be active, leading to a sharp drop across the board. Looking ahead, it is feared that the balance will be broken, and the market will likely loosen up. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, June fell by 4 fen, July fell by 3 fen, August fell by 4 fen, and September fell by 3 fen. Current wheat asking prices remained unchanged, but manufacturers indicated they would not buy unless the price dropped by 5 fen. In reality, it would need to fall a little. Qingjiangpu wheat, Nansuizhou wheat, and Bengbu wheat were priced at 5 liang and 5 fen, with a total of over 3,000 bags temporarily collected by brokers.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Silk and Tea: European Sales of Chinese Silk are Plunging <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The local foreign firm silk market is trending downward. Overseas markets have thick silk inventories and reduced consumption. Furthermore, rayon is encroaching on sales, and Japanese silk has fallen drastically, leading to increasingly sluggish European sales of Chinese silk. No one is asking about either new cocoon factory silks or current spot silks. This current situation is rare before the transition period of new and old cocoon silks. Yesterday's market remained quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Qimen Black Tea Officially Begins Weighing <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Qimen black tea has been harvested for several days since the start of picking. Aside from the top-grade白毫 tea, which some firms have been receiving sporadically, the rest have been observing the situation due to a shortage of workers. Tea dealers in Shanghai are unusually anxious. According to a telegram from Qimen yesterday, weighing has begun in both the southwest routes. Black tea from the western route is priced at $70, and goods from the southern route are priced at $55. Tea workers are currently being recruited, but this year, rice is expensive, and wages are unusually high, so when transported to Shanghai, the cost to Chinese merchants will be approximately $120 to $130 per dan.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Piece Goods: Raw Yarn Shows a Uniquely Strong Trend <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>This factory's cotton cloth has not changed much recently, and actual sales have been quiet. Fine cloth once fell, but strengthened again yesterday due to the lack of spot goods. Fine twill fell again, and Yanghe fell by another 2.5 fen. Blue Double Fish is plentiful in spot goods, making it even more depressed. Yesterday, 30 pieces of 13-pound coarse cloth were sent to Jiangxi and Anqing, with Shuangying at 6 liang, Magou at 5 liang and 9 qian, 5 fen, and Feixiong at 5 liang and 8 qian, 5 fen. 50 pieces of 11-pound Sanlu Ningbo cloth were transacted at a price of 4 liang and 6 qian. The Northern merchants have no buying interest due to the unrest in the situation. Ewo blue stripe bleached cloth was quite popular before, but now it's seeing dull sales, so the price has fallen from 7 liang and 5 qian to 7 liang and 3 qian and 5 fen.</p>
<p>East-West Piece Goods: The market outlook is uncertain. Procurement in the Zhejiang route has temporarily ceased. Shipments from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Shaoxing have been rare since yesterday. Shipments from Ningbo and Hangzhou will be extended until next Monday, so outgoing goods are already limited. However, raw yarn from the East is uniquely strong due to shortages. Dian Qiuxiang opened again at 8 liang and 4 qian. Tang Taizong Yipin Fugui has no spot goods. Li Taibai on the top opened at 10 liang and 7 qian, and Small Beauty at 9 liang and 2 qian and 5 fen, with some transactions. The decline in blue stripe色汀is quite severe. Yesterday, Zijinshan, regardless of new or old stripes, sold at 1 qian, 6 fen, 2 li, 5 hao, causing all other brands to be affected. Floral cloth also fell a little. Dark-colored cloth has sold for 4 liang. More than 20 pieces of Western jacquard yarn were traded in the Sichuan-Hankou area, with prices all around 3 qian and 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Cloth Strengthen <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports that the current price of sugar in the production area of ​​Bago is still 1.625. The price of New York sugar futures in May is still 1.58, the price in September is 1.66, which is 2 fen lower than the previous report, the price in December is 1.76, which is 2 fen lower, and the price in March next year is 1.83, which is also 4 fen lower. The current price of Java sugar is 10.125, the price of May futures is 10.25, and the price of June is 10.375, which is still lacking in fluctuations compared to the previous report. The Association market shows that the trading of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand and white remains quiet, and the supply is particularly lacking. The transaction price remains at 7 liang and 2 qian, and the market shape has turned stronger. The central sand white market is flat and tired, and few people ask about it. Nissho N mark is 7 liang and 7 qian, YP mark is 7 liang and 7 qian and 5 fen, YR0 mark is 7 liang and 3 qian, TK mark is 7 liang and 6 qian, 1 fen, 2 li and 5 hao.

<p>A letter from Huashang Advertising Company states that Medical Sage Zhang Zhongjing is the representative of Chinese medicine.

It has been approved for a three-day public screening at the Central Grand Theatre starting this month on the 30th, and will be accompanied by the slapstick comedy "Absurd Dream" to enhance audience interest.</p>
<p>The Golden Grand Theatre announces: It is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Sexual temptation is even more difficult to escape. Therefore, there are countless people who abandon their wives and seek fleeting pleasures, dreaming of a toad eating swan meat. Our Grand Theatre is opening "Swan Meat" today, starring the beautiful actress Nancy Carroll, which satirizes this idea. This film not only serves as a warning to men who engage in improper relationships but also shows women how to teach and correct ambitious husbands.</p>
<p>The Mingxing Film Company announces: The Zhejiang Provincial Government has exclusively commissioned our film company to produce and distribute the commemorative film of the National Games.

This film provides detailed footage of various sports at the Games, with particular attention to women's sports. The editing is very economical, yet the film still spans twelve reels, demonstrating its rich content. Moreover, the arrangement is skillful and the narration is moving, evoking boundless excitement in viewers and avoiding the dryness and dullness of ordinary newsreels. In addition, the film will also feature a two-reel film of the National Boy Scout Grand Review and Camp, which was filmed last week and is also of great value.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Thomas Mann and the Buddenbrooks <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Ming</p>
<p>Among Thomas Mann's three most famous works, ("Buddenbrooks") (Die Buddenbrooks), ("The Magic Mountain") (Der Zauberberg), and ("Death in Venice") (Der Tod in Venedig), ("Buddenbrooks") is considered his greatest work. This masterpiece has been hailed by critics as the pinnacle of German naturalistic literature, believing that its rich content and perfect structure are truly rare in modern literature. Not only can the author join the ranks of the world's great writers because of this novel, but the modern German literary scene can be proud even if it only produced this one work. Of course, this is the height of praise, but it is not an exaggeration, because ("Buddenbrooks") is such a book. However, we must know that it is not Mann's late work, but his first novel in his early years. When this novel was published in Germany, he was only twenty-seven years old, but he started writing it several years earlier. A young man in his twenties completed such a great and mature work, which truly makes people marvel at his flourishing talent.</p>
<p>The history of Mann's creation of this novel is as follows: Mann went to Munich at the age of eighteen and worked as an unpaid junior clerk in a fire insurance company. That was the beginning of his literary career, because he stole time there to write a novel called ("The Fallen"), which was later published in a magazine. This novel attracted the attention of readers, so Mann left the fire insurance company and went to Munich University to study, hoping to pursue a career in journalism in the future. But later, he followed his brother Heinrich to Italy. His brother was then a young man studying art (now also a famous writer). They lived together on Argentine Street in Rome. During this period, Mann worked hard to study literature and read many foreign writers' works. He liked Tolstoy the most. On the one hand, he naturally worked hard to create. He wrote short stories and a very long novel. So, when he returned to Munich from Italy, he brought with him the unfinished manuscript of ("Buddenbrooks"). This manuscript was started in Rome and completed in Munich. But before this work was published, he first published a collection of short stories, ("Little Mr. Friedemann") (Der Cleine Herr Friedemann). These novels, written in a fluent and natural style, made readers feel his uniqueness, thus attracting some attention. These novels were also written in Italy, but although they had little of the flavor of southern Europe, they had a strong Scandinavian mood. At this time, Mann wrote many short stories and published them in various famous German literary journals, thus gradually becoming famous. At that time, a writer visited him at his home and saw him writing the last few pages of ("Buddenbrooks") beside a Pleyel piano and under a portrait of Tolstoy. Mann read a page from his manuscript to his visitor, who was greatly impressed.</p>
<p>This very thick manuscript was later sent to the famous Berlin publisher Fischer, but after waiting anxiously for a long time, the bookstore still did not give him a reply. He became impatient. Coincidentally, a soldier-turned-writer, Kurt Martens, advised him to join the army. Mann followed his advice, but he could not get used to being a soldier. The hardship of training and the anxiety of waiting for a reply from the bookstore made him fall ill. When the reply from the bookstore came, he was already lying sick in bed. The bookstore's letter was very brief. The novel was too long ("Cut the wedge section shorter so that it can be printed into a book"). Mann sent back a very short reply, the gist of which was ("Either two volumes or none at all"). So the bookstore had to agree and publish the novel in two volumes.</p>
<p>("Buddenbrooks") built Mann's reputation in the literary world as soon as it was published. Soon it spread throughout Europe. In Germany, it has long become a must-have book for every family. (Next time, I will publish a brief description of ("Buddenbrooks"))</p>
<h3 id="e86">Notice to Aspiring Artists <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>By Yamamoto Kanae</p>
<p>Translated by Chen Baoyi</p>
<p>This is quite a difficult question.</p>
<p>There are no specifically required mental preparations for those aspiring to become artists. It's similar to those aspiring to be doctors, lawyers, soldiers, or merchants; the necessary mental preparations are much the same.</p>
<p>If I were to force the issue, I could only say that the life of an artist is inherently unprofitable, so one must be prepared for poverty. Even in France, where there are many art lovers, there is a proverb:</p>
<p>It says, "When a painter emerges, the family fortune declines." This is indeed true. Therefore, it is no wonder that fathers, elder brothers, and uncles who worry about their children's future strongly oppose them becoming art students. I have often seen many young people aspiring to be artists come to me for advice, but I always say, "If it's for entertainment, that's excellent. But if you want to be a professional, I don't approve," and I dissuade them.</p>
<p>What does poverty matter? It exists in any circumstance. However, when I think of the fierce competition for survival in this harsh, utilitarian society, I want to dissuade them. Also, having personally experienced the difficulties of art, I don't want them to enter the art world so lightly. Originally, there are too many artists in Japan now. There are too many artists, and on the other hand, there are many people who don't understand art, so they are in a predicament. However, the time will undoubtedly come when the public's appreciation of art increases, leading to the elimination of pseudo-artists. Although there are not as many art students as literature students, in almost every village, there is at least one young person with a three-legged stool. If they get selected even once for an exhibition in Tokyo, they immediately start a works distribution meeting (Translator's note: A works distribution meeting, also known as a painting association, is where artists temporarily set prices and sell paintings through reservations for a certain period). If the result is successful, they act like art students and want to become professionals. Compared to our student days, today's youth have a much stronger sense of utilitarianism, and their use of wisdom is much more calculating.</p>
<p>To suit the nature of an artist, first, one must be sensitive and optimistic. One's physical strength must be as strong as a soldier, yet one must have a tranquil nature. Because the life of an artist is ultimately about "seeing" and "doing," it can be said that those who have liked to watch and create since childhood are suitable to be artists. According to this, I am probably not suitable. I have heard that I used to like to watch, but I didn't really like to draw.</p>
<p>I remember asking my mother at some point whether she saw any sign of me becoming a painter since I was a child. But according to my mother's recollection, she said she didn't see anything like that. I heard that as a child, I liked to play with kite strings, concentrating on tying long strings and short strings together. My becoming an artist was due to studying Western woodblock engraving during my youth. It was not easy to carve out the drawings done by others, such as the plate bottoms drawn by painters like Watanabe Fumio and Ishikawa Toraji, using tens of thousands of triangular knife lines. But the result of printing it was that the interest in the plate was more evident than the interest in the painting. Although I was a child, I felt no interest in reproductive engraving, and I was thinking of becoming a painter like Fumio or Ishikawa, which was the beginning of my becoming a painter. From then on, I practiced pencil drawing on Sundays or at night. When I was twenty-one years old, I took the opportunity to be exempted from conscription and applied to art school. Actually, I barely got in at the bottom of the list. As for the things in the art school student era, let's talk about it some other time. According to my own experience, even if one graduates from art school, one still doesn't understand anything about painting.</p>
<p>However, even today, the Tokyo Art School is still a relatively convenient place for art students to study. Although there are four or five research institutes in Tokyo where self-taught people conduct research freely, there is no specific academic style. Although the names of great masters are posted as directors and teachers, direct guidance is extremely rare. Therefore, training as a professional is very unreliable.</p>
<p>In short, I believe that anyone aspiring to art must learn from a reliable master, work diligently, read widely, and have the composure to add bones and flesh to their work. Even if someone has latent genius, it won't work if their training is disorganized. Those who are easily bored will not succeed. Like my younger cousin, the deceased Murayama Kaita, although he was outstanding among the art students I directly taught, his excessive passion caused his special talent not to develop fully and led to his early death. I feel that no matter what, anything called creation must be done with the approach of architecture.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Stories of World Literature (1)(4)(6) by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Chapter 38: Prose of 19th Century France</p>
<p>(Madame Bovary) Why is it Flaubert's best-known work? It's hard to explain fully. Why? Because (Sentimental Education) is a tragedy of youth's withering hopes, a great book. Flaubert's vision is extremely broad. He sweeps away the differences between past and present, fact and fantasy, Romanticism and Realism. In (Salammbo), he seeks color from the past, like Romantic novelists, Scott or Dumas. However, he maintains the attitude of an objective, scientific researcher. He finds tragedy in simplicity, satire in gentleness, passion in ordinariness, and the present in the past. This kind of genius is not the genius of irony and contradiction, but the genius of seeing life's wisdom as a whole. As he approached the end of his life, a cynical spirit clouded him. In the unfinished Bouvard et Pécuchet, he borrowed small figures from the countryside and described all of humanity as fools. This aristocratic hater of the ordinary ultimately regarded us all as ordinary. Flaubert incorporated reason into romance, transforming the facts of life into exquisite beauty. Truth is not monotonous, and the elegance of words lies in simplicity, precision, clarity, and logic. This is a lesson that only masters can learn, and it instructs the Realism that followed him.</p>
<p>Maupassant, a master of the short story, is considered a disciple of Flaubert, but he did not rely on any teacher's originality. In Maupassant, nothing exists except the story, the unadorned outlines of the people who tell the story, and the place where the story happens. No writer has ever had such an interest in the problems of life's stories. It is contradictory and appropriate to put the flamboyant Romantic writer and the strict Realist together, except for Dumas. They follow separate paths, with a common gift: the ability to control all commentary about their characters. People (exist) and (act). There, human analysis, the choice between good and evil, and the contending (psychology) do not exist. Naturally, the similarities end there, because Dumas lives in a colorful past, inventing stimulating situations, while Maupassant lives in brothels and on the streets, pretending not to invent, like a Romantic falsehood that fools no one. However, the force that makes life speak for itself from within actions, without showing the appearance of manipulating human problems, Dumas has it in a different way, and Maupassant also has it within the scope of his own observations. This is a quality seen in Boccaccio and (The Arabian Nights), but often lacking in most modern novels. But if life is pitiful, comical, cruel, and vile, it seems that life, not Maupassant, should be held responsible. Why do I say this? Because Maupassant likes to depict aspects of life that are not the conventional material of parlor conversations, and some of his novels are criticized even in France, and probably should not be read by young and weak people. However, Maupassant's ethical outlook is generally sound and stern. On this point, we can trust Tolstoy. When he reached his most austere moral stage, he said, "(After Victor Hugo, Maupassant is the best modern writer. I like him very much, placing him above all his contemporaries,)" expressing that his first work showing his genius, "Boule de Suif," is a very sympathetic story, although it often seems cold on the surface. His observation of people and things is entirely for the sake of knowing what kind of stories they produce, and, regardless of whether the story is pleasant or unpleasant, he does not lean towards good or evil, towards heroes or villains, never focusing on anything other than the direct effect of his own story. He tells the story fairly and selflessly for the story itself. His language is powerful and cautious, with no superfluous matters and not a single unnecessary word. Maupassant's supreme artistry in the field of the short story makes us forget that he is a novelist with more lasting power. (A Woman's Life) and (Strong as Death) are novels that French literature can produce close to perfection.</p>
