<p>美國務卿史汀生向國人請求一致贊助倫敦海約謂此約一經吾美批准則以後將永無海備競爭之舉動各國問仇視猜疑亦可平息此恐未必如是之易也夫此海約之成旣出於勉强即美英日三國亦各表示不滿所謂互相仇視猜疑之念觀其對該約之批評攻擊而愈益暴著故即使僥倖通過而謂能從此可以束縳競爭軍備之雄心措世界於和平之域决無是理史氏又謂各國中反對此約者祇不過戰事專門家中之極端派此外則一致贊助恐亦未必蓋今日各國政府中之所謂軍人派保守派多主張充實國防論以備應變故暗中反對該約者數實非鮮表面雖以不公平爲藉口而實皆根本不贊成夫使反對該約者果僅出於專門家中最少數之極端派則决不能阻止議院中之通過也</p>
<p>此次倫敦海　旣爲美國所發起雖其結果之成績大不如發起時之所期望然而美英日三國間尚可維繫若干時之感情今若此三國者皆遷延而不通過則所極力倡導之和平不啻前功盡棄此史氏之所以大呼以求贊助也然而反觀世界大勢皆正趨於極端相反之途非特關於海約减軍派與擴軍派主張相反而已即關於政治一方向民治主義進行一方又羣趨於法西斯之旗幟下關於經濟一方以維持不易預算政費多主節縮一方對於軍費則又視爲命脈所關極力以求增加凡此種種予盾之象皆爲醖釀衝突之見端豈僅海約一事主張相反之可慮哉</p>

<p>第九屆遠東會球賽之裁判不公詳情迭見本報尤以籃球尤甚中菲兩隊隊員每戰均須引頸就命領略個中滋味爲狀至悲且慘令旁觀之日人稍有識見者亦怒吼不平批評專家於報端亦摘責裁判之失當凡此種種足證公理自在孰想裁判員田中寛次郎竟敢用大標題著文洋洋數千言詭辭反駁目空一切讀後不禁噴飯爰據原文詳譯之俾供有關係者及愛好運動者讀之</p>
<p>「愚（田中自稱）忝爲遠東大會籃球裁判員而以裁判眼光所見之三國球隊試作無忌憚之批評未免失當愚有所不得顧全禮節者蓋以裁判態度處置頗受一般誤解此種誹難或因觀衆尚未洞悉規則或因比賽激剌感情而弄非愼之自辭本可等閑視之雖然裁判不公平之聲姑勿論但事實不能緘口默殺蓋深恐此後裁判員之態度蔓延誤解匪特損傷裁判之權威抑亦污辱日本籃球界之名譽也」</p>
<p>「吾人宜有高潔之品格球隊亦然球隊品格之主要要素爲公平正大及運動道德犯規少數者乃公平正大之表現或有不構成犯規而於此賽時亦有背馳運動道德者姑勿論勝敗如何倘討論各隊品格愚當謂首推日本因其競賽表演無身體接觸於是减少犯規此非謂日本隊絶無侵人犯規如後衛重鎭之小林亦以四次犯　　　　　　　其所犯概爲不可避免者彼雖努力　　惟　身體動作拙劣或囚誤測敵手之行　致　意　人犯規耳」</p>

<h3 id="e3">Compilation of Military Reports from Various Sources <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Military News: (1) Feng Yuxiang's rebel troops are conscripting soldiers in the northwestern counties, requiring each place to provide one soldier for every 17 taels of land tax. Yexian and Xiangcheng are required to provide 1,470 soldiers each, Lushan about 900, Jiaxian about 1,200, and Baofeng about 1,100, totaling about 6,000 soldiers. They are also confiscating the guns of the local militias in Songxian, Ziyang, and Linru, causing widespread resentment among the people. (2) The rebel troops in Yexian have distributed provisions six times, each time requiring 60 catties of wheat, 30 catties of black beans, and 30 catties of fodder for every tael of land tax. There are also numerous other levies such as hat tax, shoe tax, and sock tax, which are similar in other counties, causing the people to hate them to the bone. (3) The rebel enemies in Yexian, who are surrounded by our army, are now being mediated by the local Red Cross Society, and the two sides are discussing the issue of incorporating them. (4) According to Wang Xiankun, a company commander of the enemy's 12th division who was captured, the division commander Gao Shuxun claims to have one division, but in reality only has five or six thousand people. On the 9th and 10th of this month, they launched a full-scale counterattack on various villages south of Suqiao, but due to insufficient ammunition and excessive casualties, their morale was low and the elite troops suffered more than half of their losses. The officers and soldiers are also unwilling to fight again and are not expected to invade south again. (5) According to the enemy's wounded soldiers, when the enemy and our forces fought fiercely in Qingcheng, the enemy's 37th division commander and two regimental commanders were killed by our artillery fire. Many other officers and soldiers were also killed, and there is talk of abandoning Qingcheng and retreating to the Xiaoqing River (13th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">US Secretary of State Requests Support for Naval Treaty <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>US Secretary of State Stimson requested that the nation unanimously support the London Naval Treaty, saying that once the US ratifies this treaty, there will be no more naval arms races in the future, and the mutual animosity and suspicion among nations can be calmed. This is probably not so easy. The formation of this naval treaty was the result of compulsion, and the United States, Britain, and Japan have all expressed dissatisfaction. The so-called mutual animosity and suspicion are increasingly exposed by their criticisms and attacks on the treaty. Therefore, even if it is passed by chance, to say that it can restrain the ambitious of arms competition and place the world in a peaceful realm is absolutely impossible. Stimson also said that only extremists among war experts in various countries oppose this treaty, while others unanimously support it. This is also probably not true, because today, the so-called military and conservatives in various governments mostly advocate strengthening national defense to prepare for contingencies, and secretly oppose the treaty. Although they superficially use unfairness as a pretext, they all fundamentally disagree. If only a very small number of extremists among experts oppose the treaty, then it would never be able to prevent its passage in the legislature.</p>
<p>This time, the London Naval Conference was initiated by the United States. Although the results were far less than what was expected when it was initiated, the feelings among the United States, Britain, and Japan can still be maintained for some time. Now, if these three countries all delay and do not pass it, then the peace that was so vigorously advocated will be abandoned, and this is why Stimson is calling for support. However, looking back at the general trend of the world, everything is moving towards extreme opposition. It is not only that the reductionist and expansionist factions have opposite views on the naval treaty, but also that on the political side, while democraticism is progressing in one direction, groups are trending toward the banner of fascism in the other. On the economic side, while maintaining the budget and government expenses is not easy, and most advocate austerity, military spending is seen as vital and efforts are made to increase it. All of these contradictory phenomena are the source of conflict, and it is not only the opposing views on the naval treaty that are worrying.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Reports on Recent Diplomatic Developments <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting received more than 20 reporters from various newspapers in the main hall of the ministry at 11:00 AM on the 13th. Wang reported that he has been in office for two years and has not taken a vacation. Recently, the Weihaiwei issue has been resolved, the customs autonomy has been completely concluded, and the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty has also been formally signed. Because he felt tired, he had planned to take a vacation to Shanghai for treatment, but the deans of the various academies repeatedly urged him to cancel his vacation, so he had to reluctantly return to Beijing to resume his duties. As for all diplomatic matters, they will not be suspended due to the war and will continue to be carried out with the spirit of the revolutionary government. The various matters that the ministry is most concerned about are still in progress. Regarding the extraterritoriality issue, Ambassador Wu is currently negotiating with the United States. The ministry is trying to urge Ambassador Lampson to come to Beijing for negotiations with the United Kingdom. The new ambassador to France has already set off and is expected to arrive in China around the end of this month or the beginning of next month, at which time efforts will be made to conduct consultations on important Sino-French cases. Furthermore, the recovery of concessions is the biggest task of this year and has been divided into groups for investigation. After the investigation is completed, they will be carried out separately. As for the current diplomatic situation, regarding the issue with Russia, Representative Mo is currently in informal contact with Karakhan, and the content has not yet reached the stage of publication. Regarding the revision of new treaties with various countries, the treaty between China and Cuba is expected to be signed next month, and the ministry has secretly given the full power certificate to our ambassador to Cuba. In addition, the treaty with Peru has been negotiated for more than 95%, and the issue of the treatment of overseas Chinese is still being considered in detail because it is of great importance, so the opinions of both parties have not yet been unified. Furthermore, regarding the Shanghai concession telephone sale case, the government believes that more than half of the telephone shares in the concession are Chinese shares, so it is inappropriate to invite merchants to bid for it from both a sentimental and rational point of view. Therefore, the government has decided to buy it back and has formulated relevant measures. The ministry issued a statement on this matter the day before yesterday and telegraphed the relevant ambassadors and the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association to work together with the Ministry of Communications (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Qiqihar – A military conference, with Wan Fulin, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, as its speaker, decided to construct a bronze statue of Wu Junsheng, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the Three Eastern Provinces.

In the 17th year of the Republic, Wu and Zhang Zuolin were both assassinated.  Therefore, important figures in the three provinces still remember him to this day.

<p>The New King and Queen Reconcile</p>
<p>Queen Mother Mary Also Returns Home</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 12th – The new King of Romania today signed an edict declaring Princess Elena, who was previously divorced, as the Queen of Romania. This edict is essentially a revocation of the divorce.  The political situation in Rome, which seemed to be resolved at the beginning of this week, still lacks a stable government. The King appointed General Prezan to form a cabinet yesterday, and Prezan submitted the list today, including three former prime ministers: Marius Averescu, Iorga, and others. Balaurianu, who defected from the Liberal Party, is also included.  Everyone hopes that Prezan can form a cabinet with a concentration of talent, as desired by the King. The Queen Mother has returned home, and the mother and son are reconciled. The Queen Mother has also expressed her determination to find a way to reconcile the new King and Queen within a week.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 12th – The King of Romania issued an edict allowing Princess Helen to use the title of Queen.  This announcement aims to restore the original state of affairs when the former Queen Marie died. As for the events that occurred when King Carol previously resided abroad, they can be disregarded.  Thus, the legal cancellation of King Carol's divorce from Queen Helen is rendered unnecessary.</p>
<p>Reuters, Budapest, 12th – Queen Mother Marie of Romania arrived in Rome tonight. King Carol and his eight-year-old son, Michael, went to the suburbs to welcome her and returned in the same car.

<p>Emphasizing the Need for Ratification</p>
<p>Requesting National Support</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 12th – Secretary of State Stimson spoke to the nation via radio at 9:30 tonight, requesting unanimous support for the London Naval Treaty and emphasizing the need for its ratification. He said that the treaty was designed to effectively implement the Kellogg-Briand Pact and aimed to gradually limit the increase in naval armaments. The United States, Britain, and Japan can avoid naval competition and achieve the goal of complete limitation. Once this treaty is ratified by the United States, there will never be any naval competition in the future, and the animosity and suspicion between countries can be alleviated. All countries are impartial to this treaty. Observing the opposition to this treaty in various countries, it is all from extremists in the military affairs specialists. Aside from that, the public can be said to be unanimously supportive.  Investigating the claims of the various opposition factions, they all hold different views. For example, the opposition faction in the United States believes that, according to the provisions of this treaty, the US Navy is clearly behind Britain, while the British opposition faction believes that Britain should be below the United States. The US opposition faction also claims that the United States is bound by this treaty and will be difficult to win if war breaks out with Japan, while the Japanese side says that the limitations stipulated in this treaty make it impossible for Japan to protect itself. From these extreme arguments, it can be seen that this treaty is truly fair to all countries and does not favor any one. Even worse, there is a group of warriors who make a living from war, who believe that only war can stop war. This kind of criticism is indifferent to international goodwill and underestimates the role of war prevention.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 12th – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today sent a resolution opposing the State Department's failure to hand over all secret documents regarding the London Naval Conference to Secretary of State Stimson. This resolution only expresses an opinion and will not be pursued further, so this matter can now be concluded. Although Stimson was the chief representative of the United States at the Naval Conference, everything was carried out according to President Hoover's instructions.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bombay, 12th – Non-violent protesters disregarded police orders today and rallied to celebrate the declaration of martial law in Juhura. The contingent departed from the National Party headquarters, led by Gabadiya, chairman of the Wartime Administrative Committee, who is a Parsi. The police lined up to stop them, but a small team departed from another location and went straight to the large square in Medan. The police were forced to strike the protesters with batons at one point, but then reached a decision with the leader of the crowd on the route the march should take, after which the police retreated. However, the marchers misunderstood and went in the wrong direction, so the police again blocked them, resulting in twelve injuries, including seven sent to the hospital. The marchers finally held a mass rally in Medan Square, joined by 25,000 people.</p>

<p>Japanese Cabinet Ministers Confer</p>
<h3 id="e48">Changing to an Active Policy <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Each Minister Strenuously Argues Against the Non-Policy of Austerity</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Insists on the Doctrine of Not Issuing Bonds</p>
<p>Various Ministries Have Not Yet Responded to the Austerity Plan</p>
<p>Dispatch Agency, Tokyo, 13th – In order to alleviate the unpopularity of the current cabinet due to the unprecedented economic downturn and the unfavorable financial situation, Japanese cabinet ministers are gradually considering a shift to an active policy. Shaoquan and others visited and exchanged views with the Minister of Finance the night before, and yesterday they visited Interior Minister Adachi, strenuously arguing against the inadvisability of focusing solely on austerity and explaining in detail the advantages of shifting to an active policy, especially in telecommunications-related enterprises. Interior Minister Adachi then visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi last night, saying that construction projects should be promoted to a certain extent. Minister of Railways Jiangmu also agreed on this point. A specific plan is currently being studied. The problem is the relaxation of the doctrine of not issuing bonds. The direct reason for the government's cessation of issuing bonds was (1) the implementation of the gold embargo and (2) the preparation for borrowing to exchange British 4% bonds. However, both of these have been completed to this day, and even if the doctrine of not issuing bonds is relaxed, there will be no criticism of policy flaws. If the policy shift argument becomes powerful based on these events, then the issuance of productive bonds may be approved when the budget for the 6th year of Showa is compiled. However, there is a risk that the external credit obtained by implementing the doctrine of not issuing bonds may be lost depending on the degree to which the doctrine of not issuing bonds is relaxed. Finance Minister Jing Shang said that this point must be fully considered and measures must be taken to avoid adverse effects.</p>
<p>Dispatch Agency, Tokyo, 13th – Regarding the austerity plan presented by the Ministry of Finance's Budget Bureau to the various ministries, with the exception of the Ministry of Education, which has decided to approve a reduction of half of the requested amount, the various ministries are currently painstakingly studying it. Even if they cannot comply with the Ministry of Finance's wishes, they may all agree to a considerable amount of austerity. However, the most difficult ministries are the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Navy. The Ministry of Interior intends to find other sources of funds for items outside the Ministry of Finance's request, such as reducing civil engineering costs, which will increase the number of unemployed, as a last resort. However, it is also difficult to achieve this. Also, if the Ministry of Navy reduces 80 million yuan of the subsidy for warship construction, the apportionment of its annual budget will depend on the decision of the national defense enhancement plan. It is currently difficult to determine to what extent 15 million yuan (allocated for the 5th year) of the Ministry of Finance's apportionment can be reduced. In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be able to commit to reducing 300,000 yuan of the 700,000 yuan it has been asked to reduce. Although this ministry has the least overall expenses, it is somewhat unreasonable to reduce even this small amount. The deadline for the various ministries' responses has passed a week, and none have yet responded. The Ministry of Finance has notified the various ministries that the deadline has been extended to the end of this week. Although there are difficulties and criticisms, this is progressing relatively smoothly, and it can be approved by the end of this month at the latest. Roughly 60% of the planned reduction of 58.4 million yuan can be achieved, i.e., 35 million yuan.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 13th – At the cabinet meeting on the 13th, Prime Minister Hamaguchi stated that recently there have been rumors that the government authorities will implement an active policy in order to provide relief due to the poor financial situation. However, if the government abandons the austerity and non-bond issuance doctrine it has always adhered to at this time, it is feared that the financial world will become more depressed. Therefore, in order to carry out the fundamental transformation of the economic world, the government will never abandon the fundamental principles of the austerity policy. Prime Minister Hamaguchi's intention is to urge the decision of the various cabinet members.</p>

When Preid returned to the United States after being elected a few weeks ago, he only received the President's salute upon entering the port of New York, and afterwards still regarded himself as an ambassador.</p>

It is now being actively arranged for display. Although the conference has already opened, the exhibition halls of various countries have not yet been completed. It is said that the Chinese venue can be arranged and completed soon, and the opening ceremony will be held in mid-June. At that time, people from all countries will be invited to visit and publications will be issued to carry out extensive publicity. It is expected that the results of our country's participation in the competition will be very satisfactory.</p>

<p>At 8:00 AM on the 13th, the National Government held its 80th State Affairs Meeting. The committee members present were Hu Hanmin, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Tan Yankai, Chen Guofu, Zhu Peide, and Wang Chonghui. The chairman was Tan Yankai. Nine important cases were resolved. The published ones are recorded as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan presented a case regarding the amendment of the long-distance bus regulations. It was previously issued for further amendment, and then forwarded to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Now, it has been submitted with the amended proposal, and after being submitted, it was approved by the 72nd meeting of the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the government for review and implementation. It is appropriate to prepare the regulations for review and approval. The resolution was approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. (2) The Judicial Yuan presented a case for the formulation of the implementing rules of the Civil Mediation Law in accordance with Article 16 of the Civil Mediation Law, totaling fourteen articles, which are roughly related to the procedures based on the original Mediation Law and made regulations. In addition, because this is a kind of lawsuit-settling method other than civil litigation, it is a pioneering undertaking, and sufficient time should be given before implementation so that the people can be well informed and the court can prepare in advance. Therefore, Article 14 of these implementing rules stipulates that they will be implemented from January 1, 1931. The Executive Yuan has already announced the implementing rules. It is appropriate to prepare the original text for review and record. The resolution was approved for record.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Situation After the Liu-Lu War in Fujian Province <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence on the 10th – The Liu and Lu divisions in Fujian Province suddenly became tense on the afternoon of the 6th. After the evening of the 7th, the Lu division divided into three routes and attacked the provincial capital. The first route (i.e., the front) was commanded by Yu Qianqing, with the Chen Rongbiao and Wang Tianrui regiments under its command, with the Huangdian Arsenal on Hongshan Bridge as the front line. Lu Xingrong was the commander of the second route (i.e., the left flank), with the Qian Yuguang regiment under his command, advancing from Xiaobeiling. Sun Guozhen was the commander of the third route, advancing towards Yongtai. The Liu division's plan was to have the Gui Zhenyuan Brigade defend the Xiaobeiling area against the left flank of the Lu division, and to have the Liu Shangzhi Brigade defend the front outside the West Gate against the first line of the Lu division, and to summon the Chen Wantai Brigade from Quanzhou overnight to the provincial capital to defend Yongtai against the right flank of the Lu division. The two divisions met and fought for four days and nights, one using the mountains and the other using the plains. On the dawn of the 10th, the Liu division's Jiang Regiment launched a major counterattack and finally defeated the entire Lu division. Also, the Chen Wantai Brigade of the Liu division was originally stationed in Quanzhou. The night before last, Liu Heding sent a telegram ordering them to quickly open the province. After receiving the order, Chen led his troops and hurried to the province, but because there were too few boats, they arrived in the province after two nights at Nancang yesterday. Also, the most terrifying thing on the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th was the fire alarm. In addition to the police working with various shops to prevent it, the Huang Maohe Regiment of the Land Force is stationed in Qiaonan, and the Lin Bingzhou Regiment of the Land Force patrols day and night to maintain order. The various institutions and schools have virtually come to a standstill.</p>
<p>Nihon Nichinichi Shimbun, Fuzhou Correspondence – For days, the troops of Lu Xingbang and Liu Heding have been in contact around Xiaobeiling Hongshan Bridge near the provincial capital. The people in the provincial capital are panicked and flee to take refuge. Commerce has stopped, and the price of rice and firewood has risen, making the situation extremely tragic. In fact, the fighting is not very fierce. The number of troops fighting on both sides is also very small. Lu is a native army that has occupied northern Fujian for more than ten years. The shape of the mountains and the terrain are unusually familiar. It is deeply rooted and difficult to attack. The Liu division is a guest army that has not been in Fujian for long and has recently been transferred from southern Fujian to the province. Northern troops have always been good at fighting on plains and in the field, but not good at fighting in the mountains. They have no confidence in fighting in the rugged mountains of northern Fujian. Therefore, the Liu troops are deeply concerned about being ambushed and dare not go deep. The Lu division, relying on its terrain advantages, has built a complete defense line against the Liu division upstream in recent months. Artillery has been placed on the mountains on both sides of the Minjiang River from Hongshan Bridge to Yanping, defending the river. The beaches of the Minjiang River are deep and the water is rapid, and the boats travel against the current. It is strategically disadvantageous for the Liu division to want to go up the river. Therefore, from a geographical perspective, the war between Lu and Liu cannot be resolved in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Japanese Consulate Admits Fault, Offers Compensation, and Punishes the Culprit</p>
<p>The Case of the French Warship Damaging a Lighter Also Resolved</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Following the incident on the 10th of this month in which a vehicle driven by the Japanese Navy in Hankou, lacking license plates, ran over and killed Sergeant Yang Ruiwen, a messenger for the General Headquarters, the people of Wuhan were extremely indignant. They planned to immediately organize a foreign affairs support association to petition the government for serious negotiations, demanding that the Japanese and French consulates take responsibility and hand over the Japanese perpetrator, Nakawo Seisei, to our country's courts for legal proceedings. The Japanese consulate was also required to express its apology to our authorities and should strictly restrain Japanese residents in Hankou from then on to comply with Chinese law and prevent similar incidents from happening again. The Hankou Special Municipal Government also attached great importance to this case and specially sent Finance Bureau Director Wu Guozhen on the 11th to negotiate with the Japanese Consul-General in Hankou, proposing three conditions: (1) Apology, (2) Compensation, and (3) Punishment of the culprit. All three were formally acknowledged by the Japanese Consulate. Subsequently, the Japanese Naval Attaché in Hankou, Ban He, and a certain Army Attaché went to the General Headquarters to apologize to Director He Yingqin. The matter of punishing the culprit was also the responsibility of the Japanese Consulate to severely punish. However, the amount of compensation is still under negotiation. As for the court, it is still actively investigating, insisting on punishing according to the law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of the French battleship crashing into Li Yiji's lighter and drowning worker Liu Hai, the Municipal Government also sent personnel to negotiate with the French Consulate. The French Consulate also agreed to the three conditions of apology, compensation, and punishment of the culprit, resolving the case. (June 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Tragedy of Starving People Looting Grain in Nancheng <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Villagers Riot; Many Casualties</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi Province suffered from insect pests, drought, and communist bandits last year, resulting in harvests of less than 50% of normal levels throughout the province. This year, the scarcity of rice and grain and the number of starving people are unprecedented. Everywhere, there are incidents of preventing rice and grain from leaving the area, as well as trends of people snatching rice and seizing food. Recently, grain merchants Luo Yunbiao and Jiang Fengzhou from the provincial capital purchased over 1,200 dan of rice and grain in Shangtang Market, Nancheng County, and loaded it onto 22 bamboo rafts for transport downstream. Fearing that starving people would loot the grain along the way, the merchants requested over 60 armed soldiers from the Second Squad of the First Company of the First Battalion of police to protect the rafts and prevent accidents. Unexpectedly, when they reached the river below Wuhu Village in the 44th district of the county, a group of starving people suddenly stopped the rafts from going downstream, claiming that local food supplies had run out and they were experiencing famine. They demanded to purchase 30% of the grain at a reduced price (estimated at 300-400 dan) before allowing it to pass. The two grain merchants, Luo and Jiang, were prevented from moving their grain and went ashore to negotiate with Ning Jinliang, the head of the 44th district, for several days without any result. On June 1st, the traditional Dragon Boat Festival, a huge crowd of villagers gathered at the river below Wuhu Village to watch the dragon boat races. Seeing this situation, Luo and Jiang thought the villagers had come to loot the grain. They went ashore from the rafts to explain, but the conversation escalated into a conflict. The villagers suddenly grabbed Jiang Fengzhou and started beating him. Luo Yunbiao, fearing that he would be next, jumped into the river. Since Luo could not swim, the villagers chased him in the water, and he cried for help, asking the police squad to open fire. The soldiers on the rafts, not knowing the full situation, immediately opened fire with live ammunition, killing Quan Fufeng, Yang Jiaoguan, Xu Wufu, and Zhu Gousi on the spot, and seriously injuring Quan Sanlu and Xu Zhixian. At that time, the villagers were unaware that many had been shot. After explanations from the Shangtang Police Station, Luo and Jiang were handed over to Inspector Xie for custody. Afterwards, the villagers learned of the deaths and injuries, and a mob of two to three thousand people gathered in anger. In addition to destroying the home of Li Jueqiao, who was in partnership with Luo and Jiang in the grain business, they demanded from the Shen and Zhang Commissioners sent by the county magistrate (1) that Luo and Jiang be executed on the spot; (2) that the detained 1,200 dan of grain be sold at a low price as compensation for the dead; and (3) that Li Jueqiao be arrested and executed. The Shen and Zhang Commissioners agreed to consider the demands and were trying to disperse the crowd when over a thousand more villagers arrived, chanting that Jiang and Luo had to be killed. They rushed into the Shangtang Police Station and dragged out Luo Yunbiao and Jiang Fengzhou, beating them to death. This case resulted in a total of six deaths and two injuries, another tragedy amidst the grain shortage. The Civil Affairs Department received a telegram from the Nancheng County Magistrate yesterday reporting the incident and has reportedly dispatched personnel together with the Security Department to thoroughly investigate.

<h3 id="e67">Case of French Sailor Raping Chinese Woman in Qingdao <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Government Lodges Strong Protest</p>
<p>French Consulate Apologizes to Municipal Government</p>
<p>Perpetrator Handed Over to French Consulate in Shanghai for Handling</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao is a treaty port with a mix of Chinese and foreigners. Foreigners, relying on consular jurisdiction, often bully the Chinese. Yesterday, a sailor from the French ship “Lifu Liqi Linke” forcibly dragged a Chinese woman, Dong Zhang, onto the ship in broad daylight and raped her almost to death. The citizens were extremely indignant upon hearing this. The details of the incident and the negotiations are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Incident: At 11:00 AM on the 10th of this month, Zhang, the wife of Dong Zelin, a worker at the Sifang Dakang Textile Mill, who was about 25 or 26 years old, was strolling with a neighbor near the Dagang pier. As they walked along the coast of godown F, a sailor from the French ship “Lifu Liqi Linke” came ashore and forcibly dragged Zhang onto the ship. Although Zhang desperately cried for help, there were few pedestrians on the pier, and no one came to her assistance. The neighbor, seeing this situation, panicked and ran away. Fortunately, a coolie saw the incident from afar and rushed to report it to the police post, which in turn reported it to the sub-station. The patrol officer of the sub-station immediately led a police escort to investigate. However, the sailors firmly closed the cabin doors and ignored the police's calls. Unable to do otherwise, the police went to see the captain and informed him of the incident. Accompanied by the captain, they went to the sailors' quarters and opened the door. Several French sailors were inside. Zhang was lying naked on the bed, moaning incessantly, having been gang-raped and on the verge of death.</p>
<p>Negotiations: After receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately sent Inspector-General Andre, a German, to negotiate with the captain and reported the matter to the Municipal Government. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Government, in addition to ordering the port authorities to detain the ship and not allow it to load cargo, also instructed the Third Section Chief Wu Zifeng to lodge a strong protest with the French Consul. Today (the 11th), Public Security Bureau Andre, along with Paling &amp; Co. General Manager Pei Mengshi, Chinese lawyers Song Chunfang and Li Han, and French acting Consul Tatalingfu, went to the scene to conduct an on-site investigation and interrogated the sailors. The evidence was conclusive and undeniable. The French acting Consul admitted that the sailor had indeed committed improper behavior and would take custody of him and apologize to the Municipal Government in writing.</p>
<p>Subsequent Handling: The French acting Consul has stated to the Municipal Government that the sailor involved will be handed over to the French Consul-General in Shanghai to be severely punished according to French law to deter future incidents. As for Dong Zhang, the shipowner will be responsible for compensating her for her loss of reputation as a settlement. (June 11th)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Xiang Hanping's troops have been ordered to come to Chaozhou and Meizhou to be stationed and are responsible for suppressing the Zhu-Mao communist bandits on the Fujian-Jiangxi border. The two brigades of Xiang’s division, led by Zhang Da and Zhang Ruigui, have arrived in Shantou last week and have gone to various counties in the upper reaches of the Han River to be stationed. The officers of the division headquarters also arrived in Shantou on the 7th and began working in Shantou. According to Li Heling, the political training director of the division, Xiang Shizhang (Division Commander Xiang) has sores and is now recuperating in Guangzhou and will come to Shantou with Chief of Staff Ye Minyu soon. He also said that the entire force of the Zhu-Mao communist bandits is about 5,000 men, and their main force is in Tao Wu County, Jiangxi, and only a small part of them came to Pingyuan. After the main force is stationed in Meixian, it will not be difficult to suppress them. Zhang Da's brigade has now completed the handover of defense duties in Meixian. Brigade Commander Mao Weishou passed through Shantou on the 6th on his way back to the province. It is reported that Zhu and Mao have fled back to Xunwu and towards the hinterland of Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>Li Mingguang, a local communist in Fengshun, recently led bandits to invade Jiuhe, wanting to attack the Xihuang area along the Han River. They were repelled by the military police and fled back to the Yangmeikeng and Shanglinkeng villages in the first district. Another group of local communists is causing trouble in the areas of Wuhua, Meilin, Anliu, Liyujiang, and Shangshan, confronting the guard team in Xikeng and Xiashan. Another force led by Gu Zaicun, about a thousand men, is the most rampant. On the morning of the 1st of this month, they invaded Chaoan from Fengshun Huang磜 in three routes: one route attacked Wuquan from the east, one route attacked Tiandong from Shitain, and one route attacked Fengshuwai from Juxi. Each route had about three to four hundred bandits. When the bandits came, they planted flags all over the mountains to create a false impression of strength, directly targeting the Dengtang district. At that time, the guard teams stationed in Wuquan and Tiandong fought fiercely with the bandits for half an hour. Due to being outnumbered, the bandits reached Fengshuwai at 1:00 PM on the 1st, only 20 li away from Chaoan city. Ruan Sheqing, the magistrate of Chaoan County, transferred police teams from Shangpu and other places to Dengtang to intercept them. When the bandits arrived at Fengshuwai, the telephone lines between Chaoan and Dengtang had already been cut by the bandits. The bandits and police fought fiercely for a long time. When Zhang Ruigui's brigade arrived at Chaoan City on the 3rd and cooperated with the police teams to suppress the bandits towards Tiandongxu, the local communists saw that reinforcements had arrived and fled back to Fengshun via Shitain, Juxi, and Gaoshan.

<p>Extortionist Arrested on the Spot: The family of Ma Rusong, a villager in Baijiacun outside the East Gate, is quite well-off, leading to them being targeted by bandits. The day before yesterday, Ma received a letter from bandits, signed Tang Yunqing, extorting $2,000, to be delivered by 10:00 AM on the tenth day of the lunar month to Hengjie inside the East Gate, where someone would be waiting to receive it. After receiving the letter, Ma was extremely frightened. On that day, he sent someone to the agreed-upon location, but they did not encounter anyone. Unexpectedly, the bandits sent two people to demand the money in person. Helpless, Ma had already taken refuge with relatives, so the bandits could not do anything. At 2:00 PM on the twelfth, the two bandits came to demand the money in person again. Ma's uncle, Shuyun, immediately reported to the First Police Station of the Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Patrol Officer Yu Fuxin, together with members of the Chamber of Commerce and armed members of the First Branch, rushed to arrest them. By the time they arrived, the bandits had already learned of their arrival and fled from the house, but they were captured by the members of the Chamber of Commerce. Upon questioning, they were identified as Sheng Zhongwen and Yao Guangshan, who claimed that they were sent by a certain Cai to Ma's house. A written report was immediately prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau for forwarding to the county government for legal handling.</p>

Director Gu, together with the security team and the defense corps, rushed to suppress the bandits, but they had already fled and have not yet been caught. It is now reported that about forty bandits came to the town on the tenth to demand $1,000, to be paid within ten days, otherwise they would loot the town. The town's gentry and merchants are very anxious and have reported to the Fengjing Public Security Bureau, requesting the county to issue an arrest warrant for the bandit leader Lu Zusheng to bring him to justice and eliminate the bandit atmosphere.</p>

<p>Lu Gengrong Case Scheduled for Trial; Huang and Lu's Love Affair the Main Focus: Lu Gengrong re-appealed to the Supreme Court, which in the previous month ruled that the case be sent back to the High Court for retrial. Yesterday (the 13th), Zhao Zhengcheng, acting presiding judge of the Third Criminal Division of the High Court, which is hearing the retrial of the case, issued summonses scheduling the trial for 1:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. He has also notified Lu's appointed lawyer, Song Jicheng, to appear in court at that time to defend him. Case of Fratricide Occurs in Hengjing Township: Zhou Ye, a resident of Hengjing Township, 45 years old, was killed by his son, Wei Lin, 25 years old. On the afternoon of the previous day (the 12th), Wei Lin demanded money from his father without success, and killed him with a millstone. The murderer was handed over to the city yesterday (the 13th).</p>
<p>Telephone Problems Occur in Sumu: In addition to Suzhou city, the Suzhou Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has three rural areas within its communication area: Lumu, Waikuatang, and Mudu. However, communication between Mudu and Suzhou city has only been available for three months. When the bureau first laid the telephone lines to Mudu, it submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval a regulation stipulating that calls from the city to Mudu would be charged five cents each time, but calls from Mudu to Suzhou city would not be charged. At the time, there was no such announcement to the telephone users in Mudu. Now, the residents of Mudu are opposing the rule of charging five cents extra for calls from the city to Mudu. They elected a user representative, Wang Shujie, the director of the People's Education Hall, to negotiate with the telephone bureau, but the bureau said that the fee was already on record with the ministry and could not be canceled, so there was no result. Telephone users in Mudu have therefore refused to pay their monthly telephone fees. The telephone bureau may cut off telephone lines to Mudu on the 16th of this month. After the lines are cut, they plan to submit a report to the Ministry of Communications, stating the circumstances and requesting an appropriate resolution.</p>
<p>Artist Attempts Suicide and is Rescued: Ji Zongyu, a 22-year-old artist from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, who worked at the Wuxi Advertising Agency, came to Suzhou the previous day (the 12th) and stayed in room number 14 of the Lao Sutai Hotel outside the Changmen Gate. Due to economic pressure, he had thoughts of suicide and secretly swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. The hotel tea room staff discovered this and sent him to Suyong Hospital for treatment. After an operation by Director Gu, he regained consciousness. It was then learned that Ji had sent a quick letter to his friend Wang in the Wuxi Telegraph Bureau before coming to Suzhou, saying that he had something important to discuss and hoped that his brother could come to Suzhou quickly. After receiving the letter, Wang reported it to the advertising agency, and Director Zhang came to Suzhou with him to visit him at the hospital. According to Director Zhang, Ji's suicidal thoughts were not due to economic pressure, but because of a failed romance.</p>

<p>Progress in Urban Construction: Since the main roads and major bridges in the urban area of this county have been successively demolished and rebuilt, the traffic flow has been much more convenient. Although Changshou Bridge and Rihui Bridge outside the city are on branch roads, the traffic flow is also very heavy, so the district office also plans to demolish and rebuild them. The construction of Changshou Bridge is about to be completed. After the houses on both sides that encroached on the bridge are removed, it will appear much wider. Construction on Rihui Bridge began on the 10th. Daqiao Street has been in disrepair for a long time and is quite uneven, so it is necessary to repair it. We have recently hired craftsmen to repair it and applied for the allocated stone strips removed from the county roads to pave it and make it more spectacular.</p>
<p>Director of Finance Bureau Transferred: She Yingduo, the director of the Finance Bureau of this county, has been in office for more than a year and has gained the favor of all sectors of the local community. It is now reported that the Department of Finance has appointed Shen Bingzhen from Huzhou to succeed him as the Director of the Finance Bureau of this county, while She will be transferred to the province for employment.</p>
<p>Head of Fifteenth District Resigns Due to Brain Ailment: Cai Yannong, the head of the fifteenth district of this county, recently suffered a sudden brain ailment and could not bear the heavy workload.

<p>County Government's Measures to Prevent Robberies: Recently, robberies have occurred frequently inside and outside the city. In order to ensure local safety, Magistrate Sun Zuji specially formulated four measures to prevent robberies yesterday and issued instructions to the Public Security Bureau to relay them to all sub-bureaus for compliance. The measures are as follows: (1) When a robbery occurs, the victim should try to report it to the local police or public security agency as soon as possible. Those with telephones should use them so that the Public Security Bureau can implement emergency measures in the shortest possible time. The telephone numbers of the relevant public security agencies should be recorded and memorized so that they can be reported immediately and avoid panic. (2) If the victim is trapped and unable to report the robbery at the time, the neighbors should report it on their behalf, according to the principle of mutual assistance. (3) If it is not convenient to report a robbery at the time, it should be reported directly to the public security agency or the district office within 24 hours of the incident, and the relevant agencies should immediately investigate and report it to the superior agency. (4) Victims and neighbors who violate the above measures will be subject to appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>Widow Dies Tragically from Abortion: A widow surnamed Mao, residing near Mianhua Lane outside the West Gate of this county, was over forty years old and determined to remain chaste for many years. However, she was seduced by a Zhu, the owner of a neighboring wine and rice shop, who saw that Mao was still attractive despite her age. As a result, they had an affair, and she became pregnant. By now, she was five months pregnant and quite bulky. Mao, concerned about her reputation, asked a midwife to perform an abortion. Unfortunately, the surgery was not successful, and she died. Zhu, realizing that he had caused a disaster, immediately fled elsewhere.</p>
<p>Telephone Connection Between Nine Counties: Long-distance telephone service between nine counties, including Wuxi, Jiangning, Jurong, Danyang, Wujin, Yixing, Jintan, Liyang, and Zhenjiang, was initially used exclusively for military purposes. After the situation stabilized, it was converted to civilian use. Recently, Huang Yunzhen, the magistrate of Wuxian County, proposed to connect the long-distance telephone service of the nine counties to Wuxian. Wuxian only needs to connect to Wuxi from Wujin, and then to Wuxian from Wuxi. It can also connect to Wujiang and Changshu, which would greatly benefit the commerce and security of Wuxian and the other nine counties. He immediately wrote to Yao, Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, to seek his opinion. Yao immediately wrote back to endorse Huang's proposal and then submitted a report to the provincial government to connect the telephone service of the nine counties to Wuxian. After discussion, the provincial government approved it and ordered the Department of Construction to review the matter. Upon receiving the order, Director Sun has instructed Huang, the magistrate of Wuxian County, and Yao, the Director of the Construction Bureau of this county, to be informed that the connection is approved. The department will send personnel to Wuxi to install telephone equipment and then go to Suzhou to connect the lines.</p>

In recent years, the factory has been very successful, and the supply of Huitou brand silkworm seeds has exceeded demand. Last year, they purchased more than 200 acres of land in Gaozi and planted 50,000 to 60,000 mulberry trees. The future development of seed production is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Reforms Pawnshop Malpractices: The provincial government previously approved a public letter from the Provincial Party Rectification Committee stating that the cost of pawnshop ticket printing should be borne by the pawnshop itself, and the monthly interest should not exceed 0.5%. The provincial government replied yesterday that "the stamp tax on pawnshop tickets has always been borne by the pawnshop. The monthly interest rate has also been regulated. Those exceeding 5 days a month will be charged half a month's interest, and those exceeding 15 days will be charged a month's interest, which is already reduced compared to the previous month when those exceeding 5 days were charged a month's interest." The local court sentenced six kidnappers to death by firing squad. Six kidnappers, Zhu Lao Si, Zhang Chengcai, Zhong Ba Shou, Zhu Wensheng, Zhu Kaiyuan, and Zhong Changsheng, kidnapped the victim Shu Xiuchen in Yaojiaqiao, Shujiazhuang on February 18 this year and demanded a ransom of 150,000 yuan. After Zhu Lao Si negotiated with the family in Shanghai, the price was reduced to 15,000 yuan. Just as they were about to pay the money, the Zhenjiang Investigation Team found out about the incident and, together with the Shanghai Public Concession Police, arrested Zhu and the other six men and sent them to the court for trial.

<p>Arresting Suspected Imposter Famine Representatives: Yesterday, on the afternoon of the 11th, a man named Wan Haijin, claiming to be a representative of famine victims from Tongxu County, Henan Province, arrived at the Public Security Bureau with a county-issued passport. He claimed that there were over 140 famine victims in Baotawan outside the city, requesting a stamp to facilitate travel to other counties.

<p>Provincial Committee Expedites Payment of Delinquent Deed Taxes: The Jiangsu Finance Department, concerned about the substantial arrears in deed taxes from various counties, dispatched Committee Member Tong Di-gu to Jiangdu, Yizheng, Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, and other counties to personally urge payment. Due to his inability to be present in this county, Zhang Cheng was specially assigned to investigate and expedite payment. A letter was sent to Finance Bureau Director Yu, urging him to submit a detailed table of all deed tax collections up to May of this year and to clear the accounts. Any allocated funds should be verified and jointly reported to facilitate the process.</p>
<p>Postponement of Datang Town Regular Route Launch: The Datang Inland Water Small Steamboat Company, since its establishment over thirty years ago, had an agreement with other inland water steamboat companies that Datang would not operate regular town clearing routes, and other small steamboats would not operate Yangzhou through routes. However, the Litong Company and others broke this agreement by operating Zhenjiang Taizhou routes, leading the Datang Company to also operate Zhenjiang through routes. The initial plan was to start on June 15th. It is now reported that, for the convenience of passengers, all wharves north of Yangzhou will remain the same. However, the wharves to the south require reinforced construction, and the Da Yang, Da Xiang, and other steamboats must undergo inspection procedures at Zhenjiang Customs, which have not yet been completed. Therefore, the launch, previously scheduled for June 15th, will be postponed.</p>
<p>The Truth About the Kidnapping for Ransom Case: A young woman surnamed Wang from a wealthy family in the northern countryside of Ganquan Mountain, Yangzhou, was kidnapped for ransom. Local officials dispatched detectives to apprehend Li Ma Si Zi, one of the perpetrators. It has been confirmed through interrogation that he has been detained. Seven other fugitives, including Li Wang and Chen, remain at large. It is also reported that the true nature of this case is a forced marriage rather than a kidnapping for ransom.</p>

<p>After Wu Zhihui's methods for promoting the National Phonetic Alphabet were requested on the 11th of this month, the Ministry of Education held a discussion meeting of the National Phonetic Alphabet Promotion Committee at around 3:00 PM. Attendees included Wu Zhihui, Chen Jianxiao, Dai Yingguan, Huang Zunxian, Wang Rongchang, and Peng Baichuan. The items discussed and their results are as follows: 1. Notify Committee Members Liu Luyin, Zhao Yuanren, Lu Yiyan, and Zhang Shiyi that the meeting date will be postponed as Committee Member Wu Zhihui's draft of the National Phonetic Alphabet promotion methods has not yet been completed. 2. Before Committee Member Wu's draft is completed, Zhao Yuanren's Mandarin phonograph records and textbooks will be temporarily used for promotion. 3. Ministry of Education staff will begin learning the National Phonetic Alphabet starting next week, with the grouping method remaining the same as decided at the previous preparatory meeting. 4. Committee members will participate in the review of the training booklet this Friday. 5. The table of initials with voiced sounds proposed by Committee Member Wu will be printed and sent to the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee in Beijing and to all committee members for research. 6. The four tones (level, rising, departing, and entering) are limited to annotations on Chinese characters and not to the National Phonetic Alphabet. 7. The entering tone will be retained. 8. Training teachers is still necessary for researching the National Language and National Pronunciation, but it does not seem necessary for promoting the National Phonetic Alphabet.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education staff's plan for learning the National Phonetic Alphabet was finalized on the 12th, dividing them into five groups: The Secretariat and the Counselor's Office, along with the Higher Education Department, will form one group, learning on Monday afternoons from 2:00 to 3:00 PM.

<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered all directly subordinate agencies to quickly report private secondary schools to the Ministry for record-keeping. The order states: "It has been repeatedly ordered that private secondary schools should submit applications for registration in accordance with the Regulations for Private Schools. Currently, the documents submitted by the various provincial and municipal education bureaus for the registration of private secondary schools either only list the school names without submitting other registration forms, or the Ministry orders supplementary reports after review, but they are delayed for a long time without reply. It seems that procedures are incomplete and cannot be considered formally registered. Graduates from these schools will not be accepted when public and private universities enroll new students in the 19th year, which is a very important matter. Each bureau should strictly comply with repeated orders to handle matters quickly to avoid mistakes." In addition to separate orders, a list of private secondary schools that have already been registered by the Ministry is issued for reference.</p>

<p>Deadline for Private Schools to Register</p>
<p>Submit Applications for Board of Directors Registration Before August of This Year</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau, believes that there are numerous private schools in the city, and many have not yet applied for registration. This not only makes supervision difficult but also often causes delays in students' studies. He has issued another strict order for all private primary and secondary schools in the city to apply for registration within a limited time. The order states: "It has been repeatedly ordered that all private primary and secondary schools in this city should submit applications for registration in accordance with the Regulations for Private Schools. Currently, although many private primary and secondary schools in this city have complied with the regulations and submitted applications for registration, there are still many who are waiting and seeing. Therefore, it is specially stipulated again that all private primary and secondary schools in this city that have not yet applied for registration must apply for registration before the end of August of this year. At the very least, they should apply for registration with the board of directors before August of this year. It is hereby urgently ordered that all primary and secondary schools in this city comply with this order."</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has prepared very meticulously for this junior high school graduation joint examination. On the 12th, they convened all junior high school graduation joint examination supervisors and graders in the bureau's conference room to discuss various supervision and grading issues. Those who attended included Section Chief Ni of the Municipal Education Bureau, Chuan Hou Tian, Li Dachao, Tang Shouqian, Zhang Duanzhen, Zhou Shang, Zhang Tianen, Dai Ying, Zhang Huibao, and other nine people. School representatives included Zi Rongguang and Zhu Mingxin from Chengli Middle School, Feng Zhengjun from Junyi Middle School, Zhou Yongnan and Zhou Puxian from Nanyang Middle School, Liu Shunzai from the Municipal Training Department, Li Chuanshu and Ge Xiaoyan from Nanyang Middle School, Hu Jingzhi and Ding Shaohuan from Pudong Middle School, Lu Zulong from Wusong Middle School, Yao Wenxun and Li Shandao from Zheng Yixin Guangzhao Middle School, Dai Yuheng and Wu Peiwei from Xue Shao Municipal North Middle School, Zhang Zhongyu and Yu Tianxi from Jianguo Middle School, Sun Zhenxian and Jiang Wenbao from Minli Middle School, Tu Shaokai and Yang Xibin from Zhang Xin Chang Minli Girls' Middle School, Kong Junyi and Zhang Weixin from Yuan An Jingye Middle School, Zhu Xianghu and Niu Changzai from Fudan Affiliated Middle School, Xu Zongze and Bao Huai from Bai Yang Zu Zhang Wuben Girls' Middle School, Wu Jingzhi and Rong Fangzhou from Chen Dingxiu Shanghai University Affiliated Middle School, Shao Hongzhi and Duan Rende from Song Wenhan Daxia Middle School, Zeng Guangdian and Liu Yiqing from Wu Weicheng Zhongxi Girls' Middle School, Li Zhenggan and Zhu Lanzhen from Lu Guiliang, etc. (1) The meeting began with formalities. (2) Chairman Wang Ni Kechang Wen Ya recorded Zhang Huibao. (3) The chairman reported briefly that this bureau's joint examination has a total of 1,800 students from 67 schools, with approximately 15,000 test papers in seven subjects as of today. Assistance from the various schools is required regarding the supervision and grading of the examination. It is deeply appreciated that everyone has been able to attend during this busy period. In view of the complex educational situation in this city and the varying levels of each school, even just considering the textbooks used by each school, which this bureau recently sent personnel to investigate, there are already more than 300 types. It is conceivable that the joint examination was decided to investigate the achievements of each school and increase educational efficiency. However, as this is a new undertaking, although preparations have been mostly completed, it is still feared that there may be shortcomings. It is hoped that everyone will express their opinions and discuss together. Then, printed materials such as the "Examination Supervisor and Grader Guidelines," "Examination Rules for Examinees," and "Examination Scoring Methods" were distributed. Director Ni then explained each item one by one, and everyone was satisfied. (4) Distribute supervisor badges. (5) Representatives from various schools expressed their opinions separately: A. Guangzhao suggested whether there were standards for grading test papers. B. Zhongxi suggested that, as this is the first joint examination in this city, and due to the special circumstances of each school, it is proposed that the graders be more lenient when grading the test papers. Two Zhongxi suggested whether the supervisors could change the route due to the long distance. C. Fudan Affiliated Middle School requested that the bureau provide answer keys for each subject to facilitate the graders' assessment. D. Fudan Affiliated Middle School requested that the bureau organize a middle school curriculum standard research committee to announce the curriculum and order each school to follow and standardize the level. E. Guangzhao requested that the bureau designate two subject grading supervisors to discuss the grading standards with each representative and determine the detailed rules for grading that subject together. (6) Director Ni answered each of the above questions one by one as follows: (A) Each subject's exam is based on testing, but test questions are still used to divide the grading fairly, hoping to avoid excessive subjectivity. Fortunately, the questions were extremely carefully prepared beforehand. (B) The varying levels of each school were originally a fact, as mentioned earlier. The results of the investigation of textbooks used by each school showed that there were no fewer than 300 types. As for the exam questions, they are based on the middle school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, using the minimum standard for junior high school graduates in each subject. However, I believe that although it is not overly strict, it will definitely not result in everyone graduating, which would be equivalent to not taking the exam. (C) The supervisors should contact each other and make adjustments, but the bureau must be notified. (D) The bureau has already prepared the answer keys for each subject. (E) The bureau hired experts last year to organize a middle school curriculum standard research committee and ordered each school to conduct a trial of the additions and deletions. (F) A detailed discussion will be held in groups on the afternoon of the 19th. (7) The case of grading papers by representatives of various schools was resolved by the representatives of each school recognizing each other on the spot. (8) The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Declaration on Recovering Educational Rights in Concessions <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation issued a declaration yesterday on recovering educational rights in concessions, saying: "For decades, we have paid little attention to the educational administration within the Shanghai concessions. As a result, foreigners have taken over and replaced it. When foreigners took over, we were still unaware of the loss of educational rights. Only today, under the blue sky and white sun and the Kuomintang's reforms, do we realize the loss of educational administrative power. Therefore, we are urgently seeking to recover it. However, at this time of economic hardship, creating a large number of schools and concentrating students is not something that can be achieved with simple words. If we can have appropriate planning for the educational finances in the concessions, as the central government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have said, if our country can increase the number of schools so that all Chinese children can study at home, then educational rights will have been recovered invisibly. We recognize that this is difficult to achieve at this time. However, looking at the current situation, we should first order the schools run by foreigners to add courses on party doctrine, and we should increase the allocation of educational funds within the concessions to enhance the rights and interests and improve the progress of education. This is one point. Chinese should be hired to manage the educational administration and affairs within the concessions to achieve consistency in education. This is the second point. The above two points are the necessary methods for resolving the issue of educational rights in the concessions today. It is the urgent task for those of us who advocate recovering educational rights in the concessions. In addition to expressing our support and contributing our opinions to the municipal government, this federation hereby declares that we hope that all Chinese citizens in the concessions will work together to promote the practical benefits for the future of education."</p>

<p>Japanese referees' perspective on</p>
<h3 id="e94">Far East Three Nations Basketball <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Self-Admiration (Zeng Yanhua)</p>
<p>The details of unfair refereeing in the 9th Far East Games basketball matches have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. This is especially true for basketball, where players from the Chinese and Philippine teams have to endure the situation in each game, which is extremely sad and tragic. Even Japanese spectators with some sense of judgment are roaring in disapproval. Experts in the newspapers also criticize the referees for their mistakes. All of this is enough to prove that justice prevails. Who would have thought that referee Tanaka Kanjiro would dare to write a lengthy article with a large headline, using sophistry to refute everything? After reading it, I couldn't help but laugh. Therefore, I have translated the original text in detail for relevant parties and sports enthusiasts to read.</p>
<p>"I (Tanaka referring to himself), as a basketball referee of the Far East Games, feel it may be inappropriate to offer unreserved criticism of the three national teams from a referee's perspective. However, I cannot ignore etiquette because my attitude as a referee has been misunderstood by the general public. This kind of slander may be due to the audience not fully understanding the rules or because the intense emotions of the game have led to misinterpretations. I could have dismissed it, but I cannot remain silent about the fact that the refereeing is unfair. I fear that the misunderstanding of the attitude of referees will spread and not only damage the authority of referees but also tarnish the reputation of the Japanese basketball community."</p>
<p>"We should have noble character, and so should the teams. The main elements of a team's character are fairness, uprightness, and sportsmanship. Fewer fouls are a manifestation of fairness and uprightness. Some actions, while not constituting fouls, may still violate sportsmanship during the game. Regardless of the outcome, if I were to discuss the character of each team, I would say that Japan is the best because their performance avoids physical contact, thus reducing fouls. This is not to say that the Japanese team never commits fouls. For example, Kobayashi, a key defender, also committed four fouls. However, the fouls he committed were generally unavoidable. Although he tried his best, his body movements were clumsy, or he misjudged the opponent's actions, resulting in unintentional fouls."</p>
<p>"Next is the Chinese team. Although they committed many fouls, they were all simple mistakes. It is clear that there was no malicious intent. This may be due to the Chinese team's relaxed approach compared to the Japanese team, or because the level of refereeing and understanding of the rules varied, making the players unaccustomed. However, during the second game between China and Japan, the attitude and actions of the Chinese players towards the referee seemed to be somewhat misunderstood. Despite this minor flaw, I still believe that the Chinese team is second best because of their pure temperament and emotions. The Philippine team uses tricks to deceive the referee. If we were to consider seniority, the Philippine team would be the best among the three. Therefore, their fouls are also very clever, using all kinds of tricks to deceive the audience and lure ignorant people to sympathize with them, trying to shift the blame onto the referee and the opponent's actions. Therefore, it is common to hear foul language during the game, which is very unfortunate and regrettable. (Translator's note: There are more than a thousand words criticizing the behavior of the Philippine team's players, which is exceptionally blunt. Because there are many words and mistakes, I have omitted them.)</p>
<p>"I am often shocked by the many violations committed by the Chinese and Philippine teams, especially the fouls of dribbling the ball while running and double dribbling, which occur frequently. The Chinese team's center often jumps and taps the ball before the referee throws it to the highest point. The Philippine team also often violates this rule. It seems that the two teams lack a full understanding of the new jump ball rules implemented this year, especially the Philippine team, which seems to be completely unaware of it and violates it frequently. During jump balls, the Chinese team's center often commits charging fouls, raising his left hand to the opponent's chest to prevent him from jumping or jumping diagonally in front of him, repeatedly committing fouls for unknown reasons. The Philippine players are even more likely to commit fouls of dribbling the ball while running more than dribbling the ball. The next is double dribbling. This kind of violation really kills the true value of the players' skills. Charging fouls and other violations are sometimes unavoidable, but double dribbling is not. If the players can use a little reason, they can absolutely avoid it. The fact that the Chinese and Philippine teams commit this violation a lot seems to prove that their performance is not fully practiced and proficient. The Japanese players do not commit these violations and charging fouls because they are accustomed to strict refereeing and coaches teaching the rules every night."</p>
<p>"In summary, although I do not have an exact memory, the number of fouls committed by the Chinese and Philippine teams must be several times higher than that of Japan. Those who criticize the referee's handling by simply comparing the number of fouls are ignorant of the referee's duties. Why do the Chinese and Philippine teams commit so many fouls? A well-intentioned explanation may be attributed to the negligence of domestic referees in China and the Philippines, resulting in bad habits becoming natural. Whenever the expedition team questioned the judgment, I tried my best to explain it earnestly. If I saw something inappropriate, I would also offer an explanation. If there was a suitable opportunity, I would not hesitate to give hints and reminders. I asked myself if my attitude was unnecessary. Therefore, the kindness I showed to the expedition team must have been considerably unfavorable to Japan. However, I intended to actively seek to eliminate the disadvantages of the expedition within the rules. I believe that the Chinese and Philippine teams will definitely understand my painstaking efforts." "I, as a referee for this Far East basketball tournament, have been deeply impressed by the admirable character of the Chinese team captain, Li Guochen. He has sufficient qualifications and immediately suppresses his violent behavior when he sees the feelings of his teammates. His calm attitude is admirable. The forward, Tang Baokun, has no complaints or dissatisfaction with the referee's decisions. These two gentlemen are the most well-trained and have a noble character, which Japanese players should emulate. The Philippine team coach, Huela Neiva, is also a good coach. He often comes to shake hands and praise my fair refereeing after the game, adding many words of encouragement. During the Japan-Philippines game, he worked hard to suppress the dissatisfaction of the supporters, which is very gratifying. I would like to express my full respect for the sportsmanship of all the aforementioned gentlemen and use it to conclude this article."</p>
<p>Feelings After Translation: Mr. Tanaka never penalized the Japanese players for violating sportsmanship during the game. He severely criticized the Philippine players for their tricks, but he may not know that the Japanese players also took advantage of the referee's protection and secretly used insidious tactics everywhere. As for dribbling the ball while running, the Japanese players committed the most fouls, but he turned a blind eye. When the ball was thrown into the circle, it was always biased towards the Japanese side. Three people surrounded one person, and two people sandwiched one person, but he did not call a foul. Instead, he shouted for a jump ball. In short, his reverse explanation showed that he had lost the authority of the referee. His clumsy expression was almost the object of ridicule on the field. In the final section, he falsely claimed that the Philippine team's coach praised his fairness. I still remember that before the last minute of the championship final, a reporter ran to the Philippine team's players' seat to wait for the captain to talk. After the game, coach Hui ran onto the field, his face stern, and scolded Tanaka, saying, "My team is not only fighting five people but also dealing with seven people and still able to win. What else do you have to say?" These few words not only made Tanaka lose face but also made the Japanese spectators look at each other in silence. The clumsiness of other refereeing skills was never seen before. It is not enough to criticize his incompetence. In short, he, as a referee, had absolutely no experience in major international competitions, leading to this embarrassment and leaving a fragrant name in the history of the Far East Games basketball tournament. I deeply regret it and sigh.</p>
<p>Winning the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship</p>
<h3 id="e95">Mark Schmeling <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>丨German Mark Defeats American Sharkey</p>
<p>Surrounded by opponents, Sharkey had the advantage. As a result, he failed due to an illegal cold punch. The world heavyweight boxing match, a scene of dragon and tiger fighting, was held yesterday in New York's Yankee Stadium. German Mark恭墨林 won the championship. The victory was not due to his strength conquering his opponent, American Jack Sharkey, but because Sharkey violated the rules and was declared defeated by the referee.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Sharkey's Unearned Gain <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>In the first four rounds of the battle between the two heroes, Sharkey had a clear advantage. The first, third, and fourth rounds can be said to be the autumn of Sharkey's power surge. Only the third round was the heyday of Schmeling. Judging from the overall situation, eight or nine out of ten of this championship would go to Sharkey. Unexpectedly, when the bell rang to signal the end of the fourth round, Sharkey suddenly delivered a cold punch. Schmeling fell to the corner of the ring, shouting that he had been tricked. The referee, with a clear eye, resolutely declared Sharkey's violation. The title of chief champion was awarded to Schmeling. Losing a horse may not be a blessing. The outcome was not what Sharkey had initially expected.</p>

<p>Every year, when the world heavyweight boxing championship is held, the whole country is crazy. This is because Americans usually love this sport like their lives. Now that two famous American and German players have met, it is appropriate that the place is crowded with people. There were 75,000 spectators in total, of which three-fifths were leaning towards Sharkey. Even Thornton, the former champion who has retired, said that Schmeling lacks experience and agility, not as sure as Sharkey. After four rounds, Sharkey's efforts to fight were deeply praised by the audience. However, the general public believes that the illegal action recognized by the referee was because Sharkey's punch coincided with the bell. Therefore, the crowd was excited and uproar, but the referee's order was like a mountain and could not be changed.</p>

<p>The Social Bureau Temporarily Approves the Highest</p>
<h3 id="e100">White Japonica Rice Price Increase of One Yuan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Whole Country is Almost in a State of Food Shortage</p>
<p>Reduce the Waste of Polishing Brown Rice</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, in view of the recent rice market being scarce, convened representatives of various rice industry groups on the 9th of this month to discuss maintaining the food supply in the city. After three hours of discussion, it was temporarily decided to increase the maximum price of white japonica rice by one yuan, totaling twenty-one yuan, while strictly prohibiting hidden price cuts. After receiving the report, the Social Bureau still believes that the rice price should not remain high for a long time. Considering the three aspects of food, hygiene, and business difficulties, it is only limiting the degree of brown rice polishing. The original order stated that in order to comply with the matter, this bureau convened representatives of the industry groups to the bureau on the 9th of this month to discuss maintaining the city's food supply. According to reports, the representatives of the groups who attended the meeting on that day stated that the production cost was high and the time was approaching the harvest, making it difficult to maintain the original price limit. After detailed discussion, the whole group decided to increase the maximum rice price by one yuan, totaling twenty-one yuan, while strictly prohibiting hidden price cuts. Those who violate the rules will be severely punished. The representatives of the industry groups were indeed sincere, but they still followed the trend of the Shanghai market. The public associations can take the food of the people as important and make it level. Moreover, the time for new production is still far away, and the price increase is not appropriate. Considering that the representatives can be responsible for implementation and will no longer break the rules, if there is any hidden price cut, they are willing to accept severe punishment. Since it has been decided and reported, it is temporarily approved. However, the limited highest white rice is nothing more than its fine polishing, which is commonly known as special machine japonica rice. Each stone of brown rice can only produce seven斗 of polished rice. The bran produced in the last time is as white as powder. The kind of rice quality has lost its nutrients as verified by the bureau. Eating it will turn into beriberi, heart and other diseases. The citizens are accustomed to the old habits of eating this high-priced and useless rice because they do not know its disadvantages. They only greed for the convenience of smooth swallowing. At this time, the food shortage is almost in the whole country, so it is all dependent on foreign rice to supply, and they still eat this fine white high-priced rice. It is a waste of natural resources and damages the people's food. For the sake of the people's food, for the sake of the people's hygiene, there is an urgent need to reform. It is proposed that the loss of brown japonica rice should not be less than 7.5, and only be higher than 8.5. That is, each stone of brown japonica rice produces more than one斗 of white rice than before. Ten stones will produce one stone more, which is enough for a family of eight for a month. Moreover, the rice price is reduced by the decrease in waste, and the current price per stone can also be reduced by one or two yuan. In this way, it takes into account the people's food and business feelings, and there is no omission. Therefore, the order is given to the public association to immediately notify the industry merchants to comply with it within a short period of time. After this period, the rice price will be uniformly reduced to below 20 yuan. Do not violate this order.</p>
<p>The Business Consolidation Association Announces</p>
<h3 id="e101">Relief Fund Price Increase Measures <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Fully Promote Domestic Products to Reduce Imports</p>
<p>Suppress the Rebellion and Pacify the Bandits to Increase Production of Goods</p>
<p>Limit Margin and Futures Trading to Purchase Exchange Bills</p>
<p>Import and Export Industries Settle Prices at Any Time to Avoid Danger</p>
<p>The Business Consolidation Association officially announced four measures for the relief fund price increase yesterday. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since the price of gold in the world market has gradually risen, our country is using silver standard, which is appropriate to its impact. Those who are engaged in import and export trade are daily affected by the instability of the exchange rate, and the collapse of the connection occurs from time to time. Its operation is no less than rolling into the tide. From the consumer's point of view, the number of clothing, food and daily necessities required for foreign countries has increased due to the rapid increase in commodity prices, and the standard of living has invisibly increased. Therefore, the gold price problem is not only the partial interest relationship of importers and exporters, but the interest relationship of the whole people. Since this issue has occurred, the association has received letters from various groups requesting a proper remedy for the authorities to adopt and to express the suffering of the business community. The association believes that the two ministers of finance and industry of one party attach great importance to this issue. The master plan has been seen in the newspapers, and they are both important officials in charge of the country's industry and finance. When sitting and talking, there should be people who can meet the expectations of the people. On the one hand, economic experts often contribute their research to the people of the country, and most of them hold an unbreakable economic theory and social phenomenon. Since they are self-respecting, they are more afraid that the sacrifice of the humble will turn into a mountain of damage. They have repeatedly consulted with the financial community and various groups, and all think that among the suggestions from all parties, such as prohibiting margin trading and taxing silver bars, the effect may be temporarily to make the gold and silver exchange rates change slightly, but this kind of artificial suppression method will eventually not be able to thoroughly reverse the echo or come out of our intentions. And considering that this remedy is related to various problems in the world economy and our country's political and social problems, there may be a claim to implement the gold standard or order the exchange rate standard. Because our country's currency has not yet been unified and there is no preparation at present, it cannot be achieved in one fell swoop. Moreover, politicians and economists have been exploring for several months and have not been able to find a concrete plan for implementation, which shows that fundamental relief is not easy. Even the palliative method must be carefully considered. The association's research has found that the comparative harm is less or can be a remedy for the present. There are about four measures, which are described as follows for the criticism of the people of the country. Our country's import exceeds its difference, and the opening system that has increased over the years, so the more the gold price rises, the more unfavorable the exchange rate is, and the greater the debt of international payments. To reduce this kind of damage, the method is only to start from reversing the import surplus of trade (1) Actively promote domestic products to replace imported goods to reduce imports. The four words of promoting domestic products have long become common terms in society, but the publicity has been long and there is no significant effect. It is not just that the parties only know to promote but cannot implement. The fact is that they are also blamed. Some only care about the partial interests and fail to use the general strength to promote them all. Therefore, the slogans have been years, and the results are still not fresh. For example, the cigarette industry promotes domestic cigarettes and restricts the affiliated companies to strictly abide by them, but other domestic products have no direct interest relationship with themselves, or even put them on hold. Secondly, party and government personnel have the obligation to set an example, and the government has repeatedly ordered and declared, but the facts and the documents may not be consistent. If the three circles of the party, the people, and the business community are still like this, then the remaining consumers will only seek the convenience of purchasing and use, and what more time to carefully identify them. Therefore, the promotion of domestic products in the future should concentrate the strength of the entire society and unite. The method should be that the chambers of commerce in various places organize special committees to promote domestic products to take responsibility for investigation, research and propaganda. On the one hand, the universal establishment of domestic products cooperatives provides people with the convenience of selecting and purchasing domestic products anytime and anywhere (2) Increase the production of products to increase the number of exports. Those who export raw materials from our country to foreign countries often think that the import surplus of international trade and the backwardness of industry are important reasons for this. However, since our country has been in war and banditry for years and there have been strange disasters in the northwest, agricultural products have changed from a large export to a large import, such as foreign rice and flour, which have been increasing year by year. To reverse this trade trend and make the export gradually smooth, it is thought that now when the government is revising the export tariff, it is only necessary to select the large exports of our country, which have a long history and have been imitated by various countries, and are gradually retreating in the position of being unable to compete, or these exports are currently young and will have the hope of development in the future, all of which are exempt from export tariffs to provide assistance. On the one hand, we actively suppress chaos and eliminate bandits so that traffic will not be congested, and farmers have arable land, and merchants can transport goods, so that international trade will gradually balance, and the damage caused by the gold and silver parity exchange rate can be reduced (3) Restrict non-importers and exporters from trading margin and futures or purchasing foreign exchange bills. Bank foreign exchange is also limited to import and export transactions. When people discuss the skyrocketing of gold prices, they often think that it is caused by speculation and manipulation, so there is a proposal to temporarily suspend the trading of gold exchanges. According to the facts, futures trading itself has the effect of leveling commodity prices, so it is not easy to punish all of them for fear of speculators' manipulation. The fact that it is not a business need but only to win unexpected profits is a significant fact. Adding restrictions will not hinder the unexpected wealth, and or it is enough to reduce the chaos in the market (4) Those who are engaged in import and export industries should settle prices at any time to avoid the danger of bearing the rise and fall of gold and silver parity in the future. The current damage to the foreign goods industry caused by the rising gold price is, in a nutshell, that the price was not settled when the contract was concluded, which led to the fact that the goods expected when the previous order was not enough. It is even more than double the original amount. If the goods are not issued after the order arrives in Shanghai, they will be sued by foreign merchants. If the goods are issued, the sales of the customer help are blocked, and the goods are difficult to sell. It is difficult to remove the goods due to the capital limit. During the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Shanghai's cotton and wool had already experienced this panic once. However, the current rise in the price of gold is still endless, which is even more fierce and unpredictable than the situation after the European war. At that time, some people who settled the price in advance were not affected by this unexpected loss. There is a saying, "If you do not forget the past, you can be a teacher of the future." It is true that the proportion of the quantity of orders placed by our country's merchants engaged in import and export and the capital they have prepared is often very different, so most of them are unwilling to settle the price when the order is placed, so that the operating funds are not easy to circulate. However, in view of the dangerous advantages and disadvantages of the skyrocketing and falling of gold and silver, it is appropriate to gradually think about changing the plan in order to tend to a stable one. Even for capital reasons, the order can be settled first, and the price of the goods can be paid off when the goods arrive, which can be carried out simultaneously and without using the settlement of the price and the payment of the settlement as a talk. The danger of gold and silver rising and falling is turned to the daily.</p>
<p>In addition to the second item, which must be presided over by the government before it can be implemented, the remaining three items are deemed to be practical and have no obstacles, and after implementation, there may be considerable effects, then all those in the business community are responsible for rising up and implementing them. It is hoped that they will not hesitate to consider and correct them.</p>

<p>Denies Advocating Peace Movement</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Beijing the night before last after finishing his official duties. The reporters of various newspapers made a special trip to Zhang's residence at 98 Massenet Road to pay their respects. When they were greeted, the reporters asked if there was anything wrong with the report that Mr. Zhang telegraphed to advocate peace. Zhang replied that last time I went to Xuzhou, a certain newspaper fabricated a peace telegram. At that time, I telegraphed to the mayor of Shanghai, Zhang, and asked him to investigate and publish it in various newspapers. Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that Commander-in-Chief Chiang suddenly returned to Beijing by plane, and Mr. Zhang went to the headquarters to discuss peace methods. I think it is also a deliberate rumor. I often travel between Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou because the Construction Committee and Zhejiang Province have something to discuss and contact. My actions have no value to pay attention to. I arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday and returned last night and have not been to the headquarters. Chairman Chiang has not returned to Beijing either. This kind of fabrication is completely from the hands of imperialists and reactionary elements, so as to confuse the audience. It is not worth the knowledge of the wise. It is a pity that some newspapers that do not distinguish between the truth and falsehood of the facts rashly disclose it, which is not only devoid of common sense of news, but also undermines the reputation of their newspapers. Ask Mr. Zhang if he will return to Hangzhou soon or still have to go to Beijing? I will go to Hangzhou tomorrow to take care of official affairs. The reporter asked to leave immediately and left.</p>

<p>Collision between Two Ships: The European ship "Atreus Maru" of the Japanese Osaka Company was loading cargo in Shanghai for London. As it was casting off near the 13th buoy in the Huangpu River, the "Dakichi Maru" of the Japanese Nisshin Company, which was carrying cargo for export in Shanghai, was sailing to that spot. Due to the rapid current in the river, the ship could not go straight and was hit by the current. It crashed into the outer hull of the "Atreus Maru", damaging the steel plate of the ship's hull. The cargo was not damaged. The hull of the "Dakichi Maru" was also slightly damaged, but it was not serious, so it continued to export as usual. The Osaka Company immediately reported the damage to the customs surveyor, and then repaired it itself while negotiating with Nisshin for compensation. It is now heard that the "Atreus Maru" has been repaired and will set sail immediately, and Nisshin has agreed to pay the repair costs.</p>
<p>Yichang Ship Repair: The American Jitjiang Company specializes in the Yangtze River route. The Yichang, its direct ship from Shanghai to Chongqing, was originally scheduled to load cargo in Shanghai for Chongqing today. Yesterday, because the ship's machinery was slightly damaged, the customs announced that it would be postponed for two days to facilitate repairs. Therefore, yesterday, the company had notified each passenger that the Yichang ship would be changed to leave Shanghai on Monday.</p>

<p>The first ship will sail on July 5th.</p>
<p>In order to compete in the Shanghai-New York route, Osaka Merchant Shipping Co. commissioned six motor-powered ships from the Nagasaki Mitsubishi Shipyard. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. The first ship, Kinai Maru, weighing 10,000 tons, was launched in April and completed on June 2nd. The test run showed that it can travel 18 nautical miles per hour. The hull is entirely made of steel, so it is extremely strong and has a very high speed. From Shanghai to New York via Los Angeles in the Pacific Ocean and through the Panama Canal, it only takes 38 days to arrive. This ship will depart from Shanghai on July 5th for its maiden voyage to New York. There are also five ships, Tokai Maru, Sanyo Maru, Hokuyo Maru, Kanto Maru, and Kansai Maru, which are arranged in the same way as the Kinai Maru, with beautiful decorations and extremely high speed. The interior of the ships is divided into cabins for gold, silver, valuable cargo, Huzhou silk, tung oil, etc., all of which are the latest construction. These five ships can also come to Shanghai for operation before the end of the year.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office implemented various inspections, silk merchants have been spared unnecessary losses and are quite satisfied. Inspection certificates have also gradually gained the trust of foreign countries. However, some silk merchants have failed to understand the true meaning of various inspections, saying that uniform inspection processes silk factories or that public measurement inspection reduces the amount are all misunderstandings. According to Miao Zhongxiu, director of the department, uniform inspection is especially important in raw silk quality inspection. The United States pays the most attention to it, and France has also gradually increased its attention. The inspection in this office maintains the fairness of trade between buyers and sellers, and the so-called inspection of raw silk depends on its quality and the score determined by it. There is no distinction between leniency and strictness. Those with poor quality will naturally fail the inspection, while those with excellent quality will naturally pass the inspection. Recently, some silk factories have even been given price increases after inspection because of their excellent quality exceeding the specified inspection standards, which proves that the claim that uniform inspection is too strict is actually unfounded. As for public measurement inspection, the results are different due to changes in climate and the amount of water content. Recently, due to the dry climate, the number of public measurements exceeding the net measurements has been the highest, while the number of net measurements exceeding the public measurements has gradually decreased. In short, the main purpose of the government's implementation of inspection is to completely maintain the fairness of trade and prevent any party from suffering undue losses.</p>

<p>Advocating Complete Resolution</p>
<p>Zhang Taijie, the former acting general manager of Sichuan Road Company, embezzled more than 3 million road funds. Last year, Zeng Xianzhi, the representative of the Sichuan Road Company's board of directors in Shanghai, and shareholders such as Lei Jianhou turned Zhang over to the Public Security Bureau and sent him to the local court for prosecution. The case has been going on for a year, and after the inspection period expired, a public prosecution was filed on June 3rd. Zeng Xianzhi and others believe that this matter is of great importance and cannot be presided over by a few people. Therefore, they gathered Sichuan people in Shanghai on Ximen Road the day before yesterday to discuss and temporarily named it the Sichuan Shanghai Sojourners' Road Fund Maintenance Preparatory Committee, and scheduled a hometown conference to discuss solutions. It was decided that the preparatory committee would be divided into three groups: general affairs, finance, and social interaction, and that Gongsun Changzi and Wu Jianzhong would be appointed as the directors of general affairs, Zhang Shansun and Zeng Xianzhi as the directors of finance, and Zeng Gongbei, Ni Pingou as the directors of social interaction, preparing in different ways to open the conference as soon as possible to resolve all issues.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Open Letter to Compatriots from Cotton Textile Workers <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The cotton textile workers of Shanghai issued an open letter to compatriots yesterday, saying that since the industrial revolution, capitalist countries have naturally and absolutely formed two phenomena in production: (1) overproduction; (2) lack of raw materials. In order to solve these two phenomena, they must find colonies to sell their surplus products and find ways to seize agricultural products from colonies to supply their raw materials. Many places in the world are used by capitalist countries to sell surplus products and seize raw materials, especially our China. Mr. Sun Yat-sen has already said that our country is simply a semi-colony that is worse than a colony, which is not wrong at all. After the Opium War, international imperialism used force to oppress us and set various unequal treaties that bound us, making our industry unable to develop forever and becoming a place for their economic aggression for a long time. The inability to control tariffs is a great example. For more than 80 years, our industry has not been able to develop at all, resulting in factory closures and worker unemployment, which is so painful. People's lives are nothing more than clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and clothing is especially important. In China, where industry is backward and people's lives are declining, the purchasing power of ordinary people is very low. Therefore, the importance of cotton textiles is even more obvious. Because cotton textiles have become indispensable to ordinary civilians, and the value is cheap and the material is durable, various domestic industries are doing their best to promote them. However, in the end, because the unequal treaties have not been abolished and tariffs cannot be controlled, foreign countries still have the opportunity to compete. With unequal treaties as a protective talisman, they tax their goods very lightly, thus reducing prices and using the psychology of people being greedy for cheap things to fulfill their desire to suppress the development of domestic industry. May I ask how can the cotton textile industry, which is in its infancy with short capital and lack of experience in our country, not plummet? Our country's request for the prosperity of the cotton textile industry to save the decline of China's industry is undoubtedly to abolish the unequal treaties and promote domestic goods. This is what our party, government, and people of China are working together and advocating day and night. This is also the only way we cotton textile workers believe to solve this problem. We always firmly believe that to save China's overall crisis today, there is no other way but to fight under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang based on the Three People's Principles. However, there are still many people who take advantage of the various topics of China's industrial downturn to oppress or exploit the interests of workers. Taking our cotton textile workers in Shanghai as an example, when the cotton textile industry was developed, there were more than 4,000 organized members. Now, due to unemployment, it has been reduced to more than 1,900, of which more than 2,000 are unemployed. The party and government are naturally eager to remedy the situation, but the capitalists often do not follow the guidance and orders of the party and government agencies. The lives of cotton textile workers are lower and more painful than those of any other workers. On the contrary, the working hours are more than 10 hours a day. How can this kind of hard and low-paid life of cattle and horses be in line with the purpose of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's policy for workers? Now, the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day. The wages earned by the workers cannot only not supply themselves and support their parents, wives, and children at home, but they also have to receive the terrible news of factory closures from time to time. We know that to save the decline of China's cotton industry, on the positive side, we can only strive to abolish the unequal treaties under the leadership of the party. On the negative side, in addition to requesting the party and government to prevent those who do not understand what Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Reducing working hours, increasing worker protection fees, and increasing productivity instead," from destroying our workers by taking advantage of the various topics of industrial downturn, we can only ask compatriots from all walks of life to give us considerable assistance. From the anti-Japanese movement in the past, "Stopping enemy goods is enough to put the imperialists to death." To save the decline of the cotton textile industry, before the unequal treaties are abolished, we can only ask compatriots from all walks of life to endure the loss of domestic goods being cheaper than foreign goods, and not hesitate to support the prosperity of the national industry, to remedy the decline of the cotton textile industry, and to relieve the lives of cotton textile workers across the country, and sacrifice a small amount of money and strive to promote domestic goods to resist foreign goods. It is not only the dying cotton textile workers who are telling the truth, but also fulfilling the responsibility of a citizen. Compatriots, this is a big concern for the survival of our entire China. Work hard and strive to make a final struggle for the country! Our city's cotton textile workers, at the time of imminent death, call for the realization of the Prime Minister's policy on agriculture and industry, the industrial plan, strive to promote domestic goods to resist foreign goods, implement the policy of enriching the country and enriching the people by promoting domestic goods, implement the industrial science, improve domestic goods, improve the lives of workers to improve the rate of production, overthrow the economic aggression of imperialism, overthrow the traitors who sell foreign goods, overthrow the foreign slaves who buy foreign goods, and overthrow the treacherous merchants who destroy the workers for no reason. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang!

<h3 id="e122">Dispute over Short Weight in Rice Shops <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Social Bureau Sent Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Xin Wenyao, manager of the Chunyuan Pig Shop in Nanshi, submitted a report to the Social Bureau, saying, "Report for the purpose of rice shops deducting weight and illegally profiting, requesting review and legal action. My shop's rice has always been connected with Yang Shilin, a runner of the Tongdexiang Rice Shop outside Dananmen Street. Because my shop provides meals for the customers of the investment firm, it needs about 15 dan of rice per month. Since the transaction in February of this year, it has been four or five months. Only the first time the rice came, the chef found no shortage after reporting. Afterwards, relying on the initial credibility, the rice that came had not been reported again. Yesterday, it happened that the shop sent four dan of No. 2 rice (each dan is 20 foreign dollars) to the shop. Xin Wenyao, the manager of my shop, ordered the director to report together. Unexpectedly, the weight was greatly lacking, and it was estimated that each bag was short of more than ten jin, with a total shortage of more than eighty jin, worth about more than ten yuan. Based on this calculation, the monthly loss is 37 yuan, and the half-year loss is 450 yuan. Based on the fact that the transaction has been four full months, the loss is 150 yuan in silver. I will not trace the past transactions. I immediately telegraphed Yang Shilin, the runner of the shop, to check at the shop. Knowing that he could not hide it, he begged to return the funds. My shop believes that this kind of fraudulent situation greatly violates the principle of business, which is based on credibility, and its practices are extremely harmful to the society and the common people. At the time when rice is expensive and rice is eaten, this kind of rice shop that exploits the common people should be severely punished. I sincerely hope that the punishment will be fully appropriated to the public and the losses of the common people will be compensated. In the future, if any similar situation is found in rice shops throughout the city, it can be handled in the same way to fill the market and benefit the common people. It is a very good law. I hereby report the situation of the shop deducting the weight of rice and illegally profiting. I sincerely request your Majesty to review the matter and quickly send personnel to investigate and deal with it in accordance with the law. It is for the public good. Sincerely presented to the Director of the Social Bureau, Pan." The Social Bureau then issued Instruction No. 2436 to the Jia Guxia Rice Industry Association, saying that it was ordered to comply with the matter. Chunyuan Pig Shop Manager Xin Wenyao reported that the Tongdexiang Rice Shop outside Dananmen was deducting weight and illegally profiting, and requested that personnel be sent to investigate and deal with it in accordance with the law. Based on this, Wei Zhiping and Rong Huiren were sent to investigate. The association immediately sent personnel to investigate and report together for verification. This is the order.</p>

<p>The Shanghai New Medicine Industry Association sent a letter to the Business Reorganization Association requesting proof that the Cota Western Medicine Factory is a domestic business. Yesterday, the certificate issued by the Business Reorganization Association was received as follows: For the sake of proof, it was found that Cota Western Medicine Factory, a member of the Shanghai New Medicine Industry Association, specializes in manufacturing malt extract, cod liver oil, and various medicines. In October of the 16th year, it registered with the former Agricultural and Commercial Bureau of this city in accordance with the Commercial Registration Regulations and obtained a license. In April of the 19th year, the Trademark Bureau was approved to register the trademark and issue a certificate, which has been published in the Trademark Gazette No. 33. The above two items are sufficient to prove that the pharmacy was established by a Chinese merchant and that the various goods it produces are indeed domestic goods. According to the above two points, the association requested to be given a certificate for compliance. The association believes that the nature of the pharmacy is sufficient to prove that the pharmacy has a commercial registration license and a trademark registration certificate from the former Agricultural and Commercial Bureau and the Trademark Bureau. The relevant document is hereby issued for proof as follows. After receiving the letter, the association forwarded it to Mr. Wu Jianguo of Cota Pharmaceutical Factory for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Accusation of Extortion Against Detectives <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Wu Changji has accused Hongkou Police Station detectives Cao Jie, Xu Wenzhong, Chen Bingsheng, and Chen Zhitong from Jiangbei of extortion. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhiqin of the Special District Court opened a hearing to investigate. According to Wu Changji's testimony, Tang Fujiji and Yuan Linji, both from Jiangbei, had a dispute over money on the 3rd of this month at the Changle Teahouse on Fuzhou Road. Wu Changji mediated the dispute at the scene. Around 4 PM, detectives Cao, Xu, and Chen Bingsheng suddenly arrived and took him to the Hongkou Police Station, accusing him of attempting to pickpocket someone. Later, his friend Chen Zhitong came to visit, and after a long negotiation with the three detectives, Wu Changji was released. The detectives allegedly told Chen Zhitong that they needed 250 yuan for entertainment expenses. Chen Zhitong informed Wu Changji, who agreed and paid the money to Chen Zhitong on the 5th. Wu Changji stated that he did not know what happened after that. Chen Zhitong then testified that Wu Changji was his foster son. After Wu Changji was detained, he visited him and negotiated with Detective Cao to pay 250 yuan for his release. However, when it came to paying the money, the detectives refused to accept it because of concerns about rumors. Xu Wenzhong testified that on the 3rd of this month, he and detectives Cao and Chen saw Wu Changji acting suspiciously at the Changle Teahouse, so they took him back to the Hongkou Police Station and reported it to Western Detective Captain Clatten, asking if Wu Changji had any witnesses to prove his good behavior. Wu Changji then mentioned Chen Zhitong, so they summoned Chen Zhitong. Xu Wenzhong also went to Wu Changji's residence at the Shanban Factory New Bridge to investigate and found no evidence of bad conduct. Captain Clatten then ordered Wu Changji's release. On the 6th, Detective Cao invited Xu Wenzhong to a banquet, and on the way, they met Chen Zhitong, who offered him 250 yuan, which Xu Wenzhong refused to accept. Xu Wenzhong stated that he had not solicited a bribe beforehand. The testimonies of detectives Cao and Chen were largely similar to Xu's. Captain Clatten reported that the three detectives had taken Wu Changji to the police station, initially suspecting him of being a pickpocket. He had intended to accompany the detectives to Wu Changji's home to investigate, but a fire broke out at 147 Wusong Road, and he had to go to the fire scene. Upon returning to the police station, he found Xu Wenzhong in the office, who reported that Chen Zhitong could vouch for Wu Changji's character. After questioning Chen Zhitong, Wu Changji was released due to lack of evidence of a crime. Other witnesses also testified, and lawyers from the police station and defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Fan Gang debated the matter. Judge Ge adjourned the hearing and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the afternoon of the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Accusation of Bribery Against Police Officers <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Possession of Concealed Firearm Leads to Five-Year Sentence</p>
<p>Bribery Allegations to Be Further Investigated</p>
<p>At 10 PM last night, Chinese police officers Li Zhaobang (No. 2084) and another officer (No. 1356) from the Xinzha Police Station arrested Yong Ren Wang Yinhu and confiscated a handgun with seven live rounds. They reported to the police chief that they had seen Wang acting suspiciously at the intersection of Datong Road and Xinzha Road, heading west. They attempted to search him, but he fled. They chased him into the Xin Kang Lane, where Wang allegedly drew the gun and attempted to resist arrest. Li fired two shots, and the other officer fired one shot, after which Wang surrendered. No one was injured by the shots. The police chief questioned Wang Yinhu, who claimed that Little Mapi ordered him to take the handgun to the small vegetable market. He was arrested while passing Suzhou Road. Officer Li demanded 300 yuan as a bribe for his release, and Wang agreed, but since he had no money, Officer Li fired three shots and then took him to the police station. Wang claimed that the officers' report did not match the facts. The police chief ordered Chinese detective Tao Rubi and Western detective Mai Fali to investigate. The detectives found three shell casings near Datong Road and Suzhou Road, which were identified as bullets issued to the two officers. However, the location of the casings was about 150 yards away from the location reported by the officers. Since both officers had already left work, the detectives went to their homes, brought them back to the police station, and interrogated them severely. Officer No. 1356 eventually admitted that they had apprehended Wang near Suzhou Road and fired shots. The police chief, believing that the officers had made a dishonest report, confiscated their weapons. Yesterday morning, Wang Yinhu and the two officers were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Wu held a hearing. After the Chinese and Western detectives reported the investigation, the two officers denied the bribery allegations. Wang maintained that he was carrying the gun to the vegetable market for Little Mapi and was arrested on the way. The police officer demanded 300 yuan for his release, but he was taken to the police station because he had no money. After the hearing, Judge Wu immediately sentenced Wang Yinhu to five years in prison for possessing military firearms for criminal purposes, and the handgun and ammunition were confiscated. The bribery allegations against Li Zhaobang will be investigated separately.</p>

<p>Xu Baohong's Scheme Exposed</p>
<p>Zhang Kangming, a rickshaw puller from Yancheng residing at 352 Manzhou Road in Zhabei, is 47 years old and has only one son, Xiao Liuwen, who is only six years old. The boy has delicate features and is well-loved. Zhang and his wife cherish him dearly. At around 6 PM the day before yesterday, Xiao Liuwen was playing in front of their house when he was approached by a kidnapper from Funing, Xu Baohong, who used candy as bait. Xiao Liuwen, being young and naive, took the candy. Xu then lied, saying, "I'll take you to eat sweets." Xiao Liuwen believed him and was carried by Xu towards the New Update Stage. Coincidentally, Zhang Kangming, the boy's father, was returning home from the concession when he saw a stranger carrying his beloved son. He questioned Xu, who tried to flee, abandoning the child. Zhang grabbed him and handed him over to officer Shi Qingxiang at the No. 1 precinct of the Fourth District. Zhang's wife had also reported the missing child to the police station. After questioning by Chief Yao, Xu Baohong claimed that he was not trying to kidnap the child but had noticed the gold lock and necklace around the child's neck and intended to take him to a secluded place to steal them. Chief Yao, finding Xu's statement to be an attempt to downplay the crime of child abduction, submitted a report to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Lawyer Xi's Lawsuit</p>
<h3 id="e131">Settlement of Ma's Breach of Contract Case <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Compensation of 150 Yuan</p>
<p>Apology to Xi</p>
<p>The Jinlingchun Restaurant on Zhengjia Bridge, a vegetable restaurant, is owned by the Ma family of Nanjing. The owner has five brothers, with the eldest, Ma Houji, managing the family affairs. His widowed sister-in-law, Ms. Ma, previously engaged lawyer Xi Yaofu to negotiate with Ma Houji because he did not distribute the property according to the late Mr. Ma's will. Initially, she lacked funds for legal fees and entered into a contract with lawyer Xi, stating that she would pay 30% of the recovered property as compensation. The amount in dispute was nearly ten thousand. Later, lawyer Xi was unable to reach a peaceful resolution and filed a lawsuit on her behalf. However, Ms. Ma settled with Ma Houji independently and denied that she had authorized Xi to file the lawsuit. Xi believed that Ms. Ma had broken her word and profited at his expense and was unjustly slandering him, which was intolerable. Therefore, he engaged two lawyers, Zhao Chuanding and others, to sue Ms. Ma and the guarantors of the contract, demanding the fulfillment of the contract. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court held a hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that lawyer Xi had put in a lot of effort to handle the case for the defendant and only received 50 yuan for office expenses. The defendant had reconciled without informing Xi and then claimed that she had not entrusted Xi to file the lawsuit, which was unacceptable. Xi did not care about the compensation but felt that she was too untrustworthy and should apologize. The defendant, Ms. Ma, hired lawyer Shan Yuhua to defend her and expressed her willingness to settle with the plaintiff. Judge Yang Yi also advised both parties to settle. As a result, the defendant agreed to compensate the plaintiff 150 yuan for public expenses within seven days and to issue a statement to lawyer Xi expressing her misunderstanding and regret.</p>

<p>Six robbers broke into Zheng Qianqing's Zheng Qiaji store at 12 Shenxing Lane, Zilai Street, in the French Concession, on the evening of the 21st of last month and stole over 1,300 silver dollars. The details were reported previously. Detectives Lu Jinchen, Lu Jinbao, and Bao Tan Jiang Changwen, Gu Zhou Zhixiang and others from the French Concession police station, discovered where the robbers were hiding and immediately arrested them. The robbers were Yang Asan, Zhang Songlin, Chen Ruifu, Shen Hongchu, Shen Jinfu, and the female thief Chen Wubao. They confiscated three handguns and 300 yuan of the stolen money. They were brought to the police station and handed over to the French Court for prosecution. The plaintiff, Zheng Qianqing, stated that the defendants came to rob his store three times. The first time, they were discovered by merchants who rang the alarm bell, causing the robbers to flee in fear. The second time, a student blew a whistle, causing them to flee. This was their third attempt, and they were caught off guard, leading to the robbery. He requested that they be severely punished. Yang Asan, Zhang Songlin, Chen Ruifu, and Shen Hongchu confessed that Zhang Asi, who is still at large, instigated them to commit the robbery. Shen Jinfu confessed that he went to attempt the robbery the first time but was not present during the second and third robberies, and he asked for leniency. Chen Wubao confessed that she was in a relationship with Chen Ruifu and was unaware of the robbery. The other defendants gave evasive answers. The Western detective chief reported that the third defendant, Chen Ruifu, had previously been sentenced to five years in prison for robbery and then sent to the mainland court for trial, but he did not know how he was released. He has now committed another crime and has been arrested. He requested that he be severely punished. Judge Zhu, with the approval of the French Consul, sentenced Yang Asan, Zhang Songlin, Chen Ruifu, and Shen Hongchu to five years each in the Western Prison, followed by deportation to the mainland authorities for trial. Chen Wubao was deported. The handguns were confiscated, and the stolen money was returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, we were surprised to read in yesterday's newspaper that Mr. Wang Maoting of our law firm had been dismissed. Mr. Wang Maoting has not engaged in any improper behavior and has not been dismissed. Please correct this. Sincerely, Zheng Yuxiu, lawyer.</p>
<p>In your newspaper's shipping news, it was mentioned that the Tunan collided with a Japanese ship. The Tunan returned to Shanghai from Nanjing this time and did not stop at Yangjiadu. It was carrying military orders and did not transport passengers to and from the Huangpu River and never collided with a Japanese ship. This statement is hereby declared in the paper and for your information. Huang Hongqian, Captain of the Tunan, June 13</p>

<p>A woman is a spiritual magnet for a man, so a man will often stand still when he sees a woman.</p>
<p>A teacher can teach you to read, but not everyone can see the depths of the subject. Love has no instructor, yet everyone knows how to ask for directions.</p>
<p>The more shy a woman is, the more men admire her, because a woman's shyness truly has a mysterious beauty. A woman looking at a man with a hint of intention can drive him wild. A man looking at a woman like a hawk or a hungry tiger can terrify her.</p>
<p>Cohabitation is the end of love and the beginning of troubles. If you can often think about what is in your own heart, you will naturally offend fewer people.</p>
<p>If everyone wants to achieve their ideal of a beautiful wife, concubine, Western-style house, and car by pursuing advanced knowledge, then national universities can be closed down, and government-funded students can be discontinued.</p>
<p>If you invent a science, you might as well announce it to the public so that they can admire you. If you find a new lover, it is best to keep it a secret for now.</p>
<p>The handwriting and wording of a love letter must be ten times more genuine than a letter to your parents if you want to have any hope of receiving a reply.</p>
<p>When writing a letter, it is better to be quick, but when sealing a letter, it is better to be slow, lest you accidentally seal a letter intended for Miss B in the letter to Miss A, causing a major scandal.</p>
<h3 id="e145">"Mourning Snow" by Canglang Jushi on Wu <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>"Mourning Snow" is an elegy by Wu people for the late Jiangsu Governor Cheng Xuelou. Xuelou's name was Dequan, also known as Suyuan Jushi. In his early years, he served as an official in Heilongjiang, where he was known at home and abroad for his loyalty, courage, and love for the people. Later, he was promoted to Governor of Jiangsu, where his diligence and pragmatism were evident. During the 1911 Revolution, Xuelou resolutely responded and eventually succeeded. The people of Wu praised him in the streets and alleys, saying, "Suzhou's restoration, we will never forget Governor Cheng." In the second year of the Republic of China, after retiring from official life, he went to Tianning Temple in Changzhou to be ordained, taking the Dharma name Xianhui. Later, he became the abbot of Fayun Temple in Mudu, immersing himself in Buddhist studies. In April of this year, he went to Shanghai for medical treatment and passed away on the 29th. In his will, he ordered that no obituary be issued, no funeral be held, and that he be buried as soon as possible. Before his death, Master Xue saw the decline of Hanshan Temple and the dilapidated walls and made great efforts to repair it. He also built a tomb near the temple at Banmu Bridge. Now, his coffin is scheduled to be transported to Suzhou on the 16th. The people of Wu, not forgetting his political virtues, have specially held a memorial service to express their condolences. The memorial service was held at Baoji Temple in the city on the 10th. More than 100 members of the association came, half of them from Ning, Hu, Zhen, and Xi, and those who had a connection with Cheng were all dressed in plain carriages and white horses, which was a grand occasion. Zhuang Yunkuan, Chen Taoyi, Chen Qicai, Luo Liangjian, Huang Yanpei, Shen Sifu, Zhang Yilin, Fei Shuwei, and others all wrote elegiac couplets to come for this grand affair.</p>
<p>Shen Si wrote: "Gengzi, why did you come from the north, Xinhai, why did you come from the south? Compassion is all you had to offer. All worldly desires swept away by the tide, where now is Yongkang, where now is Nantong? After countless changes, people now know."</p>
<p>Shen wrote: "From ancient times the four elements have been empty, the deceased has left as if this was understood. The Buddha's teachings say there is no rebirth, of the ancients love remains and will always leave their mark. One can mourn those like Yang Gong over the fallen tears of a monument."</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government also had a couplet that said: "The banner of righteousness was raised in the three Wus, relying on your shielding of the southeast. The mountains and lakes have not been subjected to the ravages of time. The wonderful sound participates in the six dharmas, proving the fruit of enlightenment. The cranes will welcome you to the Trayastrimsa Heaven."</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Zhang Yilin presided over the sacrifice, with solemn rituals and mournful music. Zhang also stated the major events in Cheng Gong's life and his sincere love for the people and the country, with his voice choked with tears. Yuan Xiluo, the magistrate of Taicang County, also gave a speech, detailing how Cheng's merits in building the country were sufficient to be a model for us. His words were particularly tragic. After the ceremony, a photograph was taken, and commemorative round badges were distributed, with Cheng's portrait printed in the middle and the words "Xianhui" inscribed on it.</p>

<p>When we eat too quickly, hiccups often occur. Ordinary people only know to drink good tea to relieve them, but they don't know that if you mix sugar with vinegar and eat it, the hiccups can be immediately relieved, because vinegar's property of regulating qi is better than any other item.</p>
<p>During hot weather, foul odors most easily occur in ditches, and small insects breed, which is a great hindrance to hygiene. But if we can sprinkle a few gallons of kerosene into it, this trouble can be avoided, because kerosene is rich in insecticidal power and deodorizing effect, so sprinkling it is most beneficial.</p>
<p>When it's hot, candles melt easily, which is quite uneconomical. But if you can sprinkle a little salt on them when burning, not only can you avoid the trouble of melting, but the light of the candle will also be doubled as a result.</p>
<p>The remains of the old monk Cheng Gong Xuelou" After the adjournment, it was heard that there were still offerings from abbots of various temples and elders of various mountains, which was also a great ritual of public sacrifice outside the realm.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Rambling Talk on Water Chestnuts by Zheng Yimei <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Water chestnuts are between fruits and vegetables. Eating them tastes clear and elegant, like reading the poetry of Wei Suzhou. People in Shanghai call them "ground chestnuts," and people in Guangdong call them "horse hooves." In ancient times, they also had the aliases "Wu Yu" and "Fu Ci." Fu Ci is found in the Erya, so their origin is very ancient. However, ancient people rarely sang about them, so they are not listed in encyclopedias, probably because there are no historical facts about them.</p>
<p>Water chestnuts are produced in paddy fields. In early spring, seeds are kept, waiting for sprouts to grow, and then they are buried in mud jars. After two or three months, they are transplanted back into paddy fields. The stems are about three feet high, hollow like tubes, tender and green, and very lovely. The flower spikes gather at the ends of the stems. The so-called water chestnuts are the tubers under the ground.</p>
<p>In Wansu Village outside the Feng Gate of my Suzhou, the water chestnuts produced are black. In Hualin, the water chestnuts produced are red. They are all sweet and tender in taste and are famous products.</p>
<p>In Nanchang, Jiangxi, even more water chestnuts are produced, with a lot of sweet juice. It is said that they cannot be dropped on the ground, as they will immediately become crushed and irreparable. Their tenderness is evident.</p>
<p>If you have ringworm on your face, you can scrape a water chestnut and rub it on it several times, and it will heal. Also, if you accidentally swallow an old-style coin, eating water chestnuts can help the coin pass, as they have a bowel-lubricating effect.</p>
<p>In summer, there is a cold snack called "water chestnut jelly," but in fact, there is no water chestnut in the jelly. The juice is actually a type of jelly.</p>
<p>When eating water chestnuts, there is the trouble of peeling them. Therefore, street vendors shave them and string them together for sale, called "polished water chestnuts." They are white and tender like lard and incomparably refreshing. However, vendors often soak them in cold water, which is not hygienic.</p>
<p>Water chestnuts do not rot easily and can be hung in baskets under the eaves to wait for them to dry. After drying, the skin wrinkles and is easy to peel, and the taste is even sweeter. Some people also boil them and eat them, which is also quite delicious.</p>
<p>The color of water chestnuts is red and translucent. Lacquered wooden objects with a red and translucent color are therefore called "water chestnut lacquer."</p>
<p>In the custom of Wu, one water chestnut must be placed in the rice grains when eating New Year's Eve dinner, called "digging for hidden wealth," which is truly laughable.</p>
<p>There is a sugar shop in Wu called "Wild Water Chestnut," which is quite famous. According to legend, when building the house, a particularly large and unusual wild water chestnut was dug up underground. Therefore, the shop name was immediately named "Wild Water Chestnut." The wild water chestnut that was dug up was offered in the cabinets, and for a time, it was widely spread, and the business flourished greatly. It is also a well-established shop in Wu.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Afterglow of the Qunyi Embroidery Exhibition, Pleasantly Lingering <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Qunyi Girls' School on Ai'erjin Road in this city held its second embroidery exhibition from May 31st to June 2nd at No. 179 Haining Road. The displayed embroidery works included screens, vertical scrolls, horizontal scrolls, hanging squares, etc. of figures, landscapes, flowers, and birds, as well as practical items such as embroidered pillows, clothing, quilt covers, bags, handkerchiefs, etc. The embroidery works were colorful and dazzling, and more than a thousand pieces were displayed in six rooms. Visitors reached ten thousand, all amazed. At that time, the traffic was heavy and quite a spectacle. Therefore, we have recorded the comments of the visitors to see the results and to inform those who have not seen them.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Gangshu, the celestial gang waiter, visited your school's embroidery.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Travel Notes from Nanyang (29) Spiritual Flowers <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Twenty, I visited a rubber factory with hundreds of male and female workers. Female workers are paid cheaply, now only four or five corners, male workers six or seven corners. But in the past, wages were high, but now the price has been reduced because the rubber is cheap. The smell in the rubber manufacturing place is very bad and very unsuitable for hygiene. We dare not stay for a long time, but the housing of the capitalists is like heaven. The male and female workers in this factory are also human beings. They work hard day and night in the midst of bad air, and the few corners they earn, that is, when the price of rubber was expensive in the past, the capitalists had already made a fortune. Now that the price of rubber is low, the workers alone suffer the losses. It is not a fair matter.</p>
<p>Twenty-one, I visited a friend and talked about the economic situation. According to the exchange house, Singapore has about 400,000 Chinese. In the past, the amount of money remitted to China every day could be 800,000, but recently, due to the decline in commerce, it is only 400,000 to 500,000 per day. That is, on average, each person remits one yuan to China every day, which is also 400,000 per day. From this calculation, it can be estimated that this one port alone remits more than ten million yuan back to China every month, and still one or two hundred million yuan per year. Therefore, the contribution of overseas Chinese to the national economy is not small.</p>
<p>Twenty-two, I discussed the issue of Nanyang clothing. The clothing of the natives of Nanyang is extremely simple, and even the Chinese here mostly wear white cloth clothes and rarely wear silk. The same is true for women, which is not the slightest bit a leak in the sales of foreign goods. I think that Chinese silk clothing should be promoted to suit the summer. This is also an important matter. I hope that the domestic silk industry will organize propaganda groups to come to Nanyang to promote it, because silk is not suitable for winter but is suitable for non-winter. The hundreds of millions of overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang all have the power to wear silk. Why abandon the most suitable, beautiful, and hygienic silk and listen to its decline, while contributing money to foreigners with Western cloth? Wealthy Chinese people do not wear silk but wear foreign yarn. This is abandoning their noble status and demeaning themselves, abandoning our inherent beauty and taking ugliness, abandoning refinement and taking roughness. I very much hope that the domestic silk industry will organize a large propaganda group to save the silk industry. If they seize this large market and do not promote it overseas, and sit and let it be overwhelmed by rough foreign yarn, then the silk industry will be foolish and ignorant of business conditions, and the general traitors who demean themselves by wearing foreign cloth will do so. As for saying that they advocate democracy and therefore do not wear silk, this is a deceiving statement. If you truly advocate democracy, you should run civilian factories, education, and public welfare undertakings, and be willing to spend your surplus profits to fill public welfare, not be stingy. As for Buddhists not wearing silk to avoid killing, this is a minor matter. Can we stop the fishing industry and farmers from destroying pests because of this? This is an unchanging superstition that is not worth discussing national economy and people's livelihood with. The exhibition results are outstanding and impressive, especially the Twenty-Four Filial Piety Pictures, which belong to elementary schools, so that the fundamental family education is instilled in the brains of young students. Its intention is extremely appropriate and admirable. I also presented a small vertical scroll with the words "The essence of the country, the light of Southern Chu, only Qunyi does not yield to Yuanxiang."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Menglu of Haiyan, the embroidery exhibition has six rooms, full of beautiful things, vertical scrolls, couplets, screens, square pieces, all kinds of calligraphy and painting are prepared, and supplemented with practical items, all from the embroidery work. Especially the figure embroidery and the sketch embroidery are particularly good. It is almost the so-called "the magic wants to reach the tip of the autumn hair, and the tailoring eliminates the traces of needle and thread". Therefore, I composed two short poems to leave a mark. The sentences say: "Peach and plum spring breeze flourish, the door and wall are nourished by timely rain. The five-patterned diligent woman's work, the four virtues save the world. The elegant and ingenious needle reputation, the true can be thin customs and doctors. Ascend to the hall for a browse, the colorful and happy scattered. The vitality contains the vitality, the magic reaches the tip of the hair. The golden needle to save the world, the shocking wooden bell announces. Yuan Song Gan Liao hard to carry, Li Yan Xin biography. Press the line, sigh, I am tired, the incense petals wish."</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Taixuan collected the true works of famous people in ancient times and contemporary masterpieces, all of which were produced in the Pingyuan method of silk embroidery. It is felt that there is still an antique charm in the dazzling light of jewelry, which is noble. It is not only the achievement of Jia Ye.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Xuhou of the Commercial Press said that the art of embroidery is not what I know. Visiting the rooms, the results are uniform, elegant, neat, lively, and lovely. The materials are either historical materials, such as the Twenty-Four Filial Piety, which is helpful to popular education, or ornamental items, such as landscapes and figures, all of which are lively and interesting, or valuable items, such as pillows, bedding, and clothing, which are bright and dazzling. Such results are enough to show that diligent teaching is the only way to achieve this. Miss Guo Chunqing of Jiaxing has enthusiasm and perseverance to cultivate the good character of girls and to seek a proper way to make a living. She is extremely admired, and this time she asks for sympathy and assistance from all walks of life on the issue of school buildings. I think that the education authorities and people of the society should not only maintain the permanent existence of this school with excellent results, but also support its development.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong Shiting of Jiading said that the room is full of dazzling new embroidery. Eight years of cultivation has produced needlework gods. Insects and fish are lifelike and full of fun. Flowers and birds are vividly portrayed. Adorned with the pens of talented scholars, the ingenuity of women's bodies is managed. Envy you for uniquely obtaining the cleverness of the Weaver Girl, transforming it into the eternal spring of Shanghai.</p>
<p>There are many more comments that cannot be fully recorded. A few excerpts are included to get a general idea. I heard that a small number of works will be displayed at the public art exhibition in a few days.</p>

<p>Chapter 12 Farewell banquet, farewell, and leave a beautiful shadow. Garden grand gathering, tea competition, and appreciation of beauty.</p>
<p>Who knew that after passing through the gate, there was a completely different realm. This master actually had a mother, and the whole family called her the old lady. The old lady was very strict in managing the family. Even if the master made a mistake, the old lady would also reprimand him. As long as the old lady was angry, the son would have to kneel on the ground. How could many concubines not kneel down when the master knelt down? So at that time, there was a dark crowd kneeling in a room. However, although the old lady's family education was strict, she allowed her son to take concubines. She said that it was appropriate for officials and government officials to take three wives and four concubines, but after taking them, they had to live in the large mansion and were not allowed to rent small houses outside. Whenever a concubine entered the house, the first thing she did was to see the old lady and kowtow. After kowtowing, the old lady would give a speech, especially to the girls who were taken from the brothel. The old lady said, "Now you are leaving a life of prostitution and becoming a family member. Family members have the rules of family members. From now on, you must turn over a new leaf." Moreover, in our mansion, there is no need to dress up enchantingly. For example, if you have rubbed powder and applied rouge, immediately bring a basin of face water and force you to wash off the finger powder. For example, if you have kept bangs, immediately teach you to comb your bangs up. If you can't comb them up, she calls a barber to shave off your bangs. Whatever hairstyle is difficult to look at, such as the horizontal Ace head or the vertical Ace head, is not allowed in this mansion. You must comb the same ingot bun as the old lady. All fashionable clothes must be changed. That kind of small waist and big trouser legs is a vixen's dress, not right, not right. She issues a set of red cotton-padded jackets and lined cotton leggings for you to wear. Originally, this master's ancestral home was in the north. Young northern wives wear red and green. Do you think those Shanghai girls who like to show off would be willing to wear that kind of clothes? Even the southern girls in the northern alleys have never worn that set of clothes. If you say you don't want to, now that we have spent a lot of money to buy you here, you are a member of our mansion, and everything must follow the rules of our mansion and cannot be self-assertive. If you cry and don't want to, put you in an empty room and lock you up for a year or two. By then, you will naturally be submissive and dare not have any more wild ambitions. I heard that there were many who committed suicide because of this, but people who were bought with money are not worth anything when they die. The death of one person is only the death of a dog. The master has many concubines and does not care about one or two. However, the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who talk about humanitarianism treat their concubines much more favorably. However, people who come from brothels are inevitably fickle and drift with the wind, but they cannot but be guarded against.</p>

<p>The Gold Market Has Not Escaped the Chaotic Situation</p>
<p>Starting and falling at the 70 tael mark, yesterday, the 13th, the gold price fluctuated again. However, the rise and fall were uncertain, hovering around 70 taels. The market situation was still chaotic and difficult to grasp. Throughout the day, there were ups and downs of nearly 10 taels, and people were panicked, as if they were in a fog. The foreign exchange rate was still firm. The purchase and supply of various banks in the market were different, and the quantities were not large. Moreover, the swap period was imminent. Banks such as Zhifeng, Yongshunli, Dadecheng, and Yuansheng sold some, while Chunfa, Yongyu, Dataiyu, etc. bought in a little. From the early market, the big players slightly reduced their positions and opened lower. The sellers were not idle and suddenly fell to 564.5 taels. Afterwards, the foreign exchange rate was strong and the buyers seemed lively. The market price suddenly jumped out of the 70 tael mark, and then the sellers on the table exerted their strength and fell by four or five taels in one fell swoop. Afterwards, Wansheng, Shunli, Hengxing, Zhifeng, Yong and others all sold, and the buyers were other banks. Only Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, etc. either sold or bought, with no intention. The exchange rate was stable until the gold price hovered around 70 taels. Although the storm was not as turbulent as it was a few days ago, there were still ups and downs of more than 10 taels throughout the day, which was also huge. Yesterday, the British silver was 25 lower, and the silver market was 125 lower.</p>
<p>The morning market was changeable. The opening price for July was only 567 taels, a decrease of 2.2 taels. The gross market fluctuated by several taels, from 69.5 taels to 64.5 taels. In fact, the sellers chose brave people and then slightly raised the price by more than 2 taels, first issuing a bulletin to set the price at 67.2 taels and not moving it. Not long after, it was 70.04 taels and then suppressed by 2 taels. People's hearts were uncertain. After 10 o'clock, the market situation improved, and the foreign exchange rate was tight. Mitsui and Xingye traded next month's Citibank at 37.875 yuan. The recent British gold was 6 pence 625, and the forward price was 6 pence 75. Maccari and Korea Datong, etc., also did transactions. Moreover, Hengxing, Yu Da, etc., all chased in, and the market price jumped by five or six taels and presented auspicious signs. At 11:30, it was as high as 74.4 taels. Suddenly, various banks took advantage of this high price and sold out. After only 20 minutes, it was suppressed by more than 4 taels. At noon, it was 69.8 taels. When the market closed at noon, it was 70.02 taels. However, the fixed exchange rate was still 636.6 taels, a discount of more than 60 taels.</p>
<p>The evening market was still turbulent. After the market opened at 70.02 taels, it rose to the sky. Various banks rushed to buy in. At 2:45, Hengxing also came to raise the price. Therefore, around 3 o'clock, it reached 73.4 taels. Mitsui absorbed August British gold at 6 pence 6875, and Sumitomo bought August Japanese gold at 1 tael 3.025 yuan. Afterwards, the sellers suddenly became active, and Zhifeng, Yonghengxing, etc. successively sold, and in an instant, the wind turned sharply downward, with a sharp drop of more than 5 taels. Around 3:30, it was 67.7 taels. The foreign exchange rate did not fall too much, but the people's hearts were chaotic. Only then did the sellers stop, and a few buyers appeared immediately. After that, it increased by more than 4 taels. After 4 o'clock, it was 72.2 taels. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 571.1 taels, which was 1.9 taels higher than the previous day. The maximum price in one day was 74.4 taels, and the minimum price was 64.5 taels, with a total fluctuation of 9.9 taels. The listed price was still a small discount of 64.5 taels. The account was registered in July at 70 taels, and June had been cleared. The replenishment price was 70 taels in the afternoon and 71 taels.</p>
<p>There were no large transactions. The banks that traded included Taixing, Yu Da, Taifeng, Runsen, Changyong, Chunyuan, Yongxiang, Yu, etc., all bought in. Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifeng, Yongyuankang, Xiangdadede, etc., mostly sold. In the afternoon, Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongchengfeng, Chunyuan, Yuyu Da all bought in, while Shunli, Wanxing, Zhifeng, Bingxing, Ruikang, Yuancheng, Senchengyong all sold.

<h3 id="e152">The Foreign Exchange Rate Rebounds, and the Spread is Still Far Away <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Swap Period is Approaching, and There Are Not Many Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC foreign exchange listing price, except for Hong Kong, which added 1 tael and was 83 taels, remained unchanged. However, the bank's buying and selling market price was flat at the beginning of the morning, then it became loose, and then it became firm again. The afternoon was stable, and the result was that the British gold was reduced by 125, the US dollar was reduced by 1.75, and the Japanese gold was increased by 1.25 compared to the previous day. The spread was further away, and the gold market had ups and downs of 10 taels, and finally rose slightly to 70 taels. The Chinese speculators did not make large transactions. Because the swap period was approaching, the British gold totaled about 100,000 pounds, and the Chinese merchants sold 50,000 to 60,000 pounds, which were bought in by the East Asia, Korea, and Mitsui. Tens of thousands of pounds were also sold to Maccari Mitsui, and tens of thousands of pounds were traded between various banks. In addition, more than 100,000 yuan were bought in the gold industry, which were sold by Mitsui and Datong. Mitsui also bought in tens of thousands of yuan. As for Japanese gold, Dalian sold tens of thousands of yuan in near and far futures, and Sumitomo absorbed it. However, the spread was still not in line, so there were no substantial transactions. The market atmosphere was still firm, it is said.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate in the domestic market fluctuated by 1.875, and the swap was still 0.625.

<p>Market Overview: The reason why this temporary and short-lived surge in money supply was able to turn danger into safety was entirely due to the financial authorities' proper regulation to prevent it from spreading. It can be seen that human determination can conquer nature, which is not a false statement. The rise in foreign coins in the recent market is almost the reason for this.</p>
<p>Interest Rate (Foreign Coins): In the early market, people's hearts were already trending higher, and seeing that the money supply had loosened, they tried their best to raise the price. The closing price was 7 cents 1 minute 5 li 7 hao and a half, which was 7 hao and a half higher than the early market of the previous day.

<p>Silver Coins In and Out (Silver Money): Yesterday's bank's received and remitted news was that remittances were more than receipts. Chinese merchants received and remitted more than 1.9 million yuan, foreign merchants received and remitted more than 2 million yuan, and special remittances were more than 800,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e155">The Reason for the Tightening and Loosening of the Money Supply <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>According to a recent conversation with people in the financial world, the previous tightening of the money supply was purely due to people's panic. In fact, there is no possibility of money tightening when silver is cheap. When the previous gold price surge was very strong, there were many people in the general financial world who speculated in gold and foreign exchange and suffered losses. Therefore, the outside world spread rumors of mutual infighting, so the money supply was tightened. This gold price surge will come to an end, and the market will gradually stabilize, and the money supply will loosen accordingly.</p>

<p>The yarn market's morning decline and afternoon leveling trend is still soft. Real strength needs too much lag. The American cotton decline wind is still fierce. General psychology inclines low, but the buyer's attitude is still quiet, without any intention of unloading. Currently, it still doesn't escape circling.</p>
<p>The market is slightly quiet after the human standard selling wind. Before the human standard, it opened weakly due to the American flower decline. Each month declined by 89 qian.

<p>The cotton market tends to decline. The exchange rate is not loose. American cotton's sharp decline causes real sales to be silent. Factory stomachs are greatly stagnant. A portion of the vision is naturally low. What is relied upon is that the Han group's selling wind has ceased, and the situation has been slightly calmed.</p>

<p>Due to rain in Zhabei yesterday, the source of goods was sparse, and the market sales were also not refreshing. Northern japonica rice was called high by customers, but the sales channel was extremely light, resulting in a stable large market. Extra-grade japonica rice hovered around 21.5 yuan. Ordinary japonica rice had a difference of about 1 jiao due to different product evaluations, with the market around 20 yuan. Old and secondary retail sales were slightly in progress, with the market price stable. Thin rice arrived and sales were balanced, with general changes and sluggish sales. However, the inventory was not thick, and the price was still around 18 yuan. Transaction volume in various stalls was not much for the whole day, and the trend was extremely flat.</p>
<p>Few boats arrived in South Shanghai, and the inventory in the harbor was also almost non-existent. Changshu Northern japonica rice has slightly increased in this street, and the price is firm. Su Tong machine japonica rice sources are scarce, and the market opened at 19 yuan. Southern thin rice customer sales are light, and the market is stagnant. Due to the relationship between foreign rice, Yang Du Jian has never been accurate and changeable. The Yin Hua sales are slightly active, and the countryside is also right to purchase. The large market is stable, and the ordinary high price here opened between 17 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that 100,000 bags of military grain flour have been processed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw price increases in all months. The afternoon rise was especially strong. This month's standard flour was close to the 2 yuan 6 jiao mark, reaching 2 liang 5 qian 9 fen 75. The future months had better market sentiment due to new buyers competing.

<p>The September and October months actually rose by a large amount beyond one qian.</p>
<p>17,000 bales of spot were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market was increasingly sharp. The market opened greatly in the morning, and prices rose step by step in the afternoon. This was because there were large actual sales of spot flour and factories purchased wheat more intensely. Therefore, the September month actually increased greatly by 1 qian 3 fen. At closing, June was up 6 fen, July was up 7, November was up 8 fen, August was up 9 fen, and September and October were up 1 qian 1 fen.

<p>The rise in the price of local factory cloth has been too strong in recent days, causing local customers to shrink back. Fine cloth has shown a backlash, and yesterday it uniformly fell by 2 fen and a half. Sixteen-pound Five Cranes coarse cloth is said to have a price increase next week, and there has been quite a bit of trading in this street, but yesterday it still opened at 7 liang 1 qian and a half. Fine twill cloth is being purchased more actively by Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen and other groups, and the price remains firm. The reason for this is that the rise in the price of foreign yarn is too strong, and everyone is changing the cloth to be dyed. Yesterday, small packages were sold for 6 liang 4 qian and a half. Eastern piece goods and inland groups are slightly increasing their purchases. Cotton [unclear characters] has been sold out. Fengshenbang large red color was sold out at 1 qian 7 fen 7 li, half.

<p>In the local foreign firm tea market, transactions of Qimen Ningzhou black tea and Luzhuang Tuzhuang green tea have gradually become less frequent in recent days. This is because in this time of precious gold and cheap silver, the domestic and foreign finances tend to be chaotic, and the English Moroccan market has abundant reserves of red and green tea. English tea merchants have no choice but to wait and see. Yesterday, the tea market in each market was lower than before by another 2 or 3 taels. Currently, most Zhuang numbers on each road of Tunxi and Suian have closed, and all kinds of sub-tea have stopped collecting and manufacturing. It is expected that this year's production will be about four-tenths less than last year.</p>

<p>The local foreign firm silk market has almost become a rejected situation. The opening prices of overseas Japanese silk are surprisingly low and trend downstream. Therefore, it is difficult for new factories to transfer the price via telegram. Chinese silk merchants have higher silk costs and excessive losses, making it difficult to sell. The market has become a rejected situation. Old silk is not moving through England and France, and US sales are also stagnant, tending to be depressed. The future of the foreign firm silk market is becoming increasingly dangerous.</p>

<p>Longkou thin vermicelli previously fell to 18 taels due to a lack of sales, but recently the price has risen by 3 qian due to inventory shortages and increased sales.

Those with relatively thin inventories are waiting and watching, and do not intend to sell. The trend may become tense again.</p>
