<p>時評</p>
<h3>三國協定說</h3>
<p>近日海會中傳有英美日三國恊定說。意蓋以此會議。如不能全部成功。則不得已而求其次。先解决海洋方面問題。而徐俟歐陸方面之妥恊於異日。亦不可謂非成立一半之功也。然而五强間之利害。實係互相牽連。大有成則俱成敗則俱敗之勢。與歐陸有利害關係者。未必與海洋無關。與海洋有利害關係者。亦未必與歐陸無涉。均不能專顧一面而不問其他。如果先成立三國協定。則適以啓法意之疑慮。而反招不滿之感。非特國際間更無融洽希望。或竟因此而引起險惡之形勢。亦未可知。即退一步言之。法意方面。縱不因此增加反感。交涉進行。並不有所牽制。然觀英美日三國交涉之經過。恐亦未易妥協。蓋在前數日三國協定倡議之初。美國亦並未完全同意。即使今日已經認可。而日本對於七成要求。則依然未肯讓步。其政府對於若槻之請示。雖尙遲遲未覆。但海軍當局之態度。則固已明示於世矣。况乎英美日之利害關係。亦甚複雜。决非僅僅此單純之七成問題。故三國協定說。亦祇可視爲理想上之空談。而决不易見之於事實也。</p>
<p>若以三國協定爲不可能。仍返而屬望於五國協定全部之成功。則其勢更難。蓋歐陸方面之形勢。確較海洋方面更爲棘手。自法意兩代表會見後。非特並未稍見接近。且法代表白里安已返巴黎。泰狄歐亦以轉圜無望。表示未必赴英則此方面交涉之生機。已可謂不絶如縷。是故今日之海會。欲合全部以解决之。其困難旣若此。欲先解决一半。以一半待諸將來。又爲情勢所不許。然則海會將空費此數月之經營。竟毫無結果而終歟。</p>

<p>中華得萬國足球錦標</p>
<p>昨二比○勝蘇格蘭</p>
<p>七年來首次獲冠軍</p>
<p>春光明媚、風和日暖、正健兒　身手之期、昨日上海中華隊以二比零克服蘇格蘭、奪得本屆上海萬國足球錦標、中華棒球塲上、中西士女、約計萬餘、歡呼之聲、震動天地、爆竹之聲、如電暴發、轟轟烈烈、懿歟盛哉、從未染指之上海萬國足球錦標、爲中華初次奪得、如試嘗一　、味洵美也、從此富麗堂皇之萬國杯上、亦刻着（中華）兩字、及與蘇格蘭决戰之偉績、留作永久之紀念矣、誠爲上海　人足球界之新紀元也、</p>
<h3>歷年各隊所獲錦標</h3>
<p>查上海萬國足球錦標賽、始於一九○八年、中途除歐戰時停止四年外、餘者年年舉行、從未間斷、英格蘭得勝次數最多、蘇格蘭次之、蓋足球爲英國之發源地、技術出衆、宜其戰績最優也、茲將歷屆錦標列下、</p>
<p>一九○八···○九英格蘭一九○九···一○英格蘭</p>
<p>一九一○···一一英格蘭一九一一···一二愛爾蘭</p>
<p>一九一二···一三英格蘭一九一三···一四英格蘭</p>
<p>一九一四···二五英格蘭一九一五···一九停　戰</p>
<p>一九一九···二○英格蘭一九二○···二一英格蘭</p>
<p>一九二一···二二英格蘭一九二二···二三英格蘭</p>
<p>一九二三···二四英格蘭一九二四···二五蘇格蘭</p>
<p>一九一五···二六蘇格蘭一九二六···二七蘇格蘭</p>
<p>一九二七···二八英格蘭一九二八···二九葡萄牙</p>
<p>一九二九···三○中華</p>
<p>綜觀上觀、共賽十八年、計英格蘭得十二次錦標、蘇格蘭得三次、愛爾蘭·葡萄牙及中華、各得一次、</p>
<h3>七年來首次獲冠軍</h3>
<p>吾國參加該項競賽、始於一九二三年、屈指一數、亦有七年歷史、第一屆成績平平、但自此對於國際競爭、深具决心、從此努力訓練、果在第二屆（即一九二四丨二五年即能與蘇格蘭相會於决賽中、當時中華棒球塲上、萬餘觀衆雄壯熱烈之歡呼聲、至今猶盤旋於吾人腦際、但結果中華不幸以零對四受挫、錦標雖未奪得、但以中華新近加入、即能得决賽權者、亦予有榮焉、嗣後在一九二七至二八年之一屆、中華與英格蘭又得相會於决賽中、期時中華實力甚强、大有冠軍希望、不料曁南大學足球隊有南洋之行、健將如馮軍佑·陳鎭和·梁官松等均未能加入、以致實力大減、而遭二對四之慘敗今年第三次得决賽權、果能以二比零擊敗稱雄一時之蘇格蘭隊、攫取錦標、績數年來之努力、今乃建立奇功、如願以償曷勝榮幸、</p>
<h3>中華隊早有把握</h3>
<p>本屆參加者、共有中華猶太、葡萄牙、蘇格蘭、英格蘭五國、其中除猶太實力較差外、餘均勢均力敵、各有錦標希望、初賽猶太敗於蘇格蘭、次賽中克英、蘇克葡、觀兩組當時戰况、中之勝英、確有功夫、而蘇之敗葡、乃僥倖所致、故昨日中蘇决賽、西報上、已有果决之斷語、謂中華可操必勝、記者亦有同様之論調、一場劇戰、不出所料、二比零之結果、看來頗爲費力、然觀競爭形勢、中華攻勢甚多、但以運道不佳、失去絶好機會者、不下七八次、否則勝球之數、奚止於此、</p>
<h3>獲球均在下半時</h3>
<p>下午三時聞始交鋒、上半時中華順風而攻、聲勢極盛、惟前鋒頗現散漫、不能有佳妙之合作、以致遇有機會、不能從中取利、觀衆心裏、十分焦燥、且以爲上半時不能取勝、下半時逆風而戰、未免吃力、亦且不利、詎知再戰聲中、前鋒之聯絡怱佳、短傳遞之工夫極妙、陳虞添之右翼、益見勇敢、二次傳中、被戴林經打中、使中華奪得錦標、内外均能呼成一氣、故力量充足、使對方難於發展、中堅孫思敬及守門周賢言、俱見出色、前鋒以陳虞添最佳、矯小玲瓏、跑奔迅速、身高力大之碧眼兒、竞無從捉摸、陳之踢角球、百不失一、不可多得、惜傳送時之發脚太慢、此爲美中不足耳、</p>
<h3>蘇格蘭少聯絡</h3>
<p>至於蘇格蘭方而、以後衛［大塊頭］透納最佳、餘皆平平、前鋒缺少聯絡、球即至中華門前、因無互助能力、故肖攻門機會、加以脚頭不準、難施会倆、前鋒與前衛其中隔斷、前鋒進攻時、前衛往往不向前接應、球至還出時、常無繼續進攻之機會、此爲大病、上半時始終未見起勁、下半時負一球後、聲勢略振、幾次侵犯、使中華頗受驚惶、卒以蘇隊力量單薄、徒喚奈何耳、兩隊陣線如下、</p>

<h3>開球後中華即占上風</h3>
<p>牛閹之下、蘇隊得開球權、因逆風而戰、力量減少、中華乃乘機取利、李惠堂用高球傳與王雍劼、王送至門前、戴麟經陳虞添會同而上、時敵門前定虛、大可從容進取、不料戴頭頂未中、絶好機會、竟然失去、惟中華聲勢不衰、陳虞添送甚爲得法、球沿蘇之球門橫木落下、蘇隊守門躍起白托後方、虞添繼踢角球、挑送雖佳、未能得利、</p>
<p>萬國足球錦標决賽中華及格蘭兩隊攝影（王開攝）</p>
<h3>中華一再失機會</h3>
<p>孫思敬坐鎭中堅、應接有方、連續三次在後方截得對方反出之球、向蘇格蘭球門進攻、均被救出、中華雖屢失機會、並不氣衰、反見精神抖擻、勢如潮湧、球常自右路深入、得力於右翼陳虞添者甚多、有一次李惠堂在敵隊球前二十碼處得球、䠀停脚步、猛力一脚、對門踢去、觀衆以爲馬到成功、敵壘旦夕可下、不料又打在敵人脚上彈回、機會一再失去、負負不已、</p>
<h3>上半時平平過去</h3>
<p>蘇格蘭迭經風浪、盡力抵抗、方告退敵、遂引兵追殺中堅茂洛用高球踢至中華門前、中華内衛江善敬失脚、被對方左内鋒衝前搶得、加上幾步、正得打門、江見機不妙、反身追去、球乃阻住未幾、蘇格蘭右翼踢角球、落點殊佳混戰多時、卒克萊怱在門之右角上五六碼處得球、對門射去、正中周賢言身上、周眼快手快、連忙接住、躱過敵人、一脚送至前方、化險爲夷、嗣後往來馳騁、各所建樹、上半時乃各平安過去、</p>
<h3>下半時中華開紀錄</h3>
<p>略進檸檬、互調方向、繼續對壘、中華雖居逆風、力景反見加增、李惠堂傳球至右方、陳虞添沿邊帶球殺進、傳至蘇格蘭門前、球掠門向左、王雍劼還至門前、球將入門、戴麟經又衝前加上一脚球乃入門、頓時歡聲四起、震於雲霄、而爆竹之聲、亦綿綿不絶、一種熱烈盛况、誠非筆墨所能描寫、</p>
<h3>蘇格蘭努力反攻</h3>
<p>蘇格蘭負一球後、並不氣餒、反見勇氣勃發如中瑪琲、努力反攻、殺氣騰騰、於是中華門前、險象戴生、四面夾攻、將中華包圍、水洩不通、海雷及辛克萊施勁射擊、周賢言幾成衆矢之的、幸内衛戒備森嚴、周賢言招架得法、未致失利、然中華已飽受朢驚矣、</p>
<h3>第二球由戴踢進</h3>
<p>混戰聲中　李惠堂接得蘇格蘭右翼踢出之球、引兵進攻、將球遠送右方、陳虞添追踪而上、截住盤前、衝過一關、帶球飛步、進發、浩浩蕩蕩、直入無人之境、同時觀衆掌聲四起、彩聲不絶、虞添愈加得神、衝至門邊、傳向門前、不料無人接應、功虧一簣、但一波方去、一波又來、蘇隊球門、又遭包圍、前鋒用短兵相接、敵人不易捉摸、戴麟經碰然一脚、球應聲入網、中華乃勝兩球、於是中華聲勢愈盛、呐喊震天、李惠堂兩次失機陳家球亦告惡運、未能得利、殊歎惜、</p>
<h3>周賢言急智救球</h3>
<p>蘇格蘭旣負兩球、心殊不甘、再接再厲、意圖報復、後在中華門前三四十碼踢任意球、球急有力、正在門前落下周賢言接而失手、江善敬加上一脚、方告得險、不料被蘇右前衛得、還至中華門前、蘇格蘭大軍衝上、周賢言被敵人紏倒地上、爭扎不脫、周無可奈何、情急智生、即將球抛出界外、遂告無事、嗣後中華又攻、李惠堂猛力打１</p>
<p>球門、不高不低、極有力道、蘇之守門員、托出後方、洵見功夫、全塲讚美不止、劇戰結果、中華以二比零勝、</p>
<h3>中華獲奬羣衆歡呼</h3>
<p>比賽旣畢、即在塲中給奬、由西人足球會會長葛林顯（）Grishaw））演說、略謂此次上海萬國足球比賽、中華隊以眞實本領、奪得錦標、殊可欽佩、繼葛氏乃將銀杯提給中華隊長李惠堂、互相歡呼而散、</p>
<h3>匹刺堡却令治錦標賽中華獲勝</h3>
<p>▲四十七比四十</p>
<p>▲我國技術不凡</p>
<p>▲下週三六再賽</p>
<p>中華籃球隊與匹刺堡之［却令治］錦標賽、採三賽二勝制、昨晚兩隊第一次之戰、繼萬國女籃球而起、結果中華隊以四十七比四十勝、裁判員張國勛史密斯、其餘二次比賽、定下星期三·六·兩日、</p>
<p>（一）海上怪有首無尾</p>
<p>匹刺堡稱雄海上、號曰海怪、外人稱之曰［派拉脫］、意即海盜也　兇悍可見一斑、此次自菲來、聲勢暄赫、下書挑戰、爲美復仇、惟昨晚與中華交手之下、未見若何之精彩、上半時以一分勝中華隊、下半時疲落不、起、但中華隊固不可不愼也、</p>
<p>（二）陸鍾因柱石依然</p>
<p>中華隊陣綫與美國對壘時稍異、何通未來魏海靑乃居中鋒、黃運利·梁國權分兵左右、陸黎後衛、昨晚戰來、表演似未及萬國奪標時之美妙、惟陳鍾恩之指揮自如、臨陣不亂、戰必有序、自然全隊柱石、黎寳駿之穩健、有口同稱、魄黃梁則各有所長矣、</p>
<p>（三）匹刺堡曇花一現</p>
<p>兩軍接觸、黃運利紀錄首開、梁國權繼而成四、先聲奪人、軍勢大振、然匹隊急起直追、反以八比七佔先、此後兩軍幾勝負難分、此隊勝二分、球勢緊張、觀者張目吐舌、以俟勝負、上午時匹隊居然以十七比十六告勝、中華以一分見負、然此不過爲匹隊之迴光返照、曇花一現而已、</p>
<p>（四）中華隊風順帆高</p>
<p>檸檬再戰、相持不下、相差仍在一二分之間、然中華隊忽靑雲直上、經黃梁之互建奇功、黎寳駿之遠射中的、乃以三十一比二十三之數、遙列匹隊之前、而匹隊豈球運之不佳、中鋒華爾足部受傷、負痛而戰、實力不損、最後不得已乃出、而後衛健將派克又四次犯規被罰出、中華隊乃一帆風順、以四十七比四十告捷、</p>

<p>▲聯邦勝中華　中華隊之不敵聯邦、自在意中惟以上半時之形勢克聯邦不可謂希望全無下半時之一落不起意想不到者也、席均陳新元邵錦英之前鋒各個球藝固佳稍欠聯絡爲病　後衛差强人意、失之過遲於是無以敵傑漢生茜娜之銳捷上半時十一比九中華勝　結果二十九比十五、聯邦勝裁判員史密斯、</p>

<h3>討論改良租界電話問題無進展</h3>
<p>字林報云、租界電話問題、内容複、雜意見紛歧、恐尙非一時間所能解决、蓋此次以華洋德律風公司設備陳舊、經費不充、不克應付意外之發展、致市民責難蠭起、工部局因於數月前起而有所處置、但最初似僅直接與公司交涉、嗣遂組織顧問委員會、討論此事、並考慮國際電話電報公司·愛列克森公司·與電纜電話信託公司·三家之標函、至是關於兩租界市政機關特許營業之條、件遂成問題、因三家標函中、兩家所擬之財政與營業計劃、大體根據於華洋德律風公司現享之特許權利、而第三家則另附有重訂特許權之辦法、自此兩月中工部局與公董局往返磋商、迄未能商得共同政策、如新公司之派息、定爲八厘與一分、特許營業年限之爲十年二十年、抑四十年、與將來電話費之多寡、以及改訂年限等、皆成爲雙方爭執之點、即上星期一之會議、亦依然毫無進展、蓋公董局似因激於工部局辦理上有失就商之處、因此對於工部局最近之提議、亦未同意、外間且有法租界擬自組電話公司之傳說、然當局此時方在從容磋商中、而吾輩電話用戶與股東以及顧問委員會與投標公司等、則已不勝其忍耐、因此事久懸不决、電話公司將無從擴充、而顧問委員會之工作將等於虛廢、投標公司代表所耗之時間與金錢、亦將毫無結果云、</p>

<h3>自由車趣談</h3>
<p>— 夢綺</p>
<p>春之神的慈光。已漸漸地照被着人們了。在薰風暖日中。最使人感覺到濃厚興趣的戶外運動。自然是自由車。因自由車的聯想。便憶起了許多趣事。</p>
<p>許多地方的當局。是不准女子騎自由車的。理由多是有碍風化。但我們細細想來。實在女子乘自由車。是一件最適當的運動。不過流弊所滋。自然也難免。例如從前杭州一般妓女。常乘着自由車來招引游蜂浪蝶。因之地方當局便不得不下令禁止了。</p>
<p>一位朋友告訴我。說一位善乘自由車的少年。因賽車而結識了一位女朋友。這位女朋友。也是善於乘自由車的。後來因爲志同道合。便結了婚。結婚的時候。由來賓的慫恿。請新夫婦比賽自由車。結果還是新娘勝利的。想來一定是新郎讓步的。不然。這位女子。到着實有些本領了。</p>
<p>大凡在初學自由車的時候。最有趣味。將學會的幾天。差不多日夜把自由車縈思着。雖然破皮流血。終不能罷。到了練習好時。反覺得一無趣味。否則那班傳遞紅綠信封的綠衣人。未免太開心了。實際上他們眞可說不出的苦呀。</p>
<p>小小一輛自由車。却也變化無窮。我從前在哈摩斯敦馬戲場參觀。那位演者的御用自由車。眞是神出鬼没。時而用手代脚。時而全力凌空。時而倒行。時而豎起。最有趣的拆了兩段。祇有一個輪了。而那人還能照常前進。豈不奇怪呢。</p>
<p>我從前也極喜歡乘自由車。有一次。在親戚家裏乘車回來。天已黑暗了。跑了不久。因路面不平。竟直衝到河裏去了。那時自己以爲必無生理。那知没頂之後。偏又浮了起來。我抓了一把草。想往岸上爬。忽然後好像有人拉住。我眞惶急了。心想莫非是眞的有鬼嗎。後來回身一看。纔知道是長衣被車墊繫住了。不覺好笑起來。大槪世人所謂鬼神。也無非是心理作用罷了。結果。性命是保全了。長衫是撕破了。自從得了這個敎訓以後。我一望見自由車。便膽寒。再也不願和它親近了。</p>

<h3>籌防飛機談</h3>
<p>— 朱興</p>
<p>我國統一告成。急籌安全。廻思邊省受飛機擲炸彈之害。達數百里之廣。損失及千萬之數。而邊防軍雖用機關槍迫擊砲及高射砲等。猛力上攻。均難命中。其故由於飛機之高度與速率。非槍砲之力所能及。現今各國擴充飛機。精製炸彈。將來爲世界空中戰爭之最利器。故德國擬建銅質大幕。高三百碼。分作數層。放置人造烟霧。掩蔽空際。俾敵機茫然不知所措。家烈平遜氏提議。將都市築於地下。得免粉身碎骨之慘。各國均有建議。而我國鑒於邊省之害。亦爲刻不容緩之舉。故擬造飛擊箭。其高度與速率。可勝於飛機。若猛射時。則空中彈火炸發。猶如火山。雖德國最新式之戰鬥機。亦難逃免。若不預爲籌防。盈需盈野之人將無噍類。其造箭之法。另有說明。願吾政府試造此箭。爲救國救民之計畫。由此而疆圉可以鞏固。民命亦可以安全矣。（却酬）</p>
<h3>别開生面之攝影館</h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>老友石子世磐。在靜安寺路戈登路口之安樂坊中設一攝影之館。雖云影館。實亦寓所也。予耳其名久。日前因侍老母并挈錚玲二兒登其門。見門前有地一弓。蒔花數本。一稚柳高出籬外。作嫩綠。若磬折以迓客者。室中陳桌椅數事。均作現代最新之式。樸雅可喜。聞皆由江小　君爲之規劃者。壁間雜陳影片。參差不一。多爲人像。取光之剛柔適當。不同凡俗。蓋皆石子傑作也。登其樓。爲攝影之室。窗間障絨幕。環列打光燈多事。均　以白絹。光線明澈。而絶不刺目。背景以褐色厚呢爲之。略無襞摺之痕。中列一絶巨攝影機。鏡頭爲德製。値數百金。非凡品也。稍進絨帘貼地。爲一化妝之室。妝台亦新式。玲瓏可愛。佐以華燈錦整。并裸美人承焑之盤。無不精美絶倫。令人流連不忍去。參觀一周。即由石子爲老母攝一影。繼又爲予及錚玲二兒攝影。配光指導。一絲不苟。越日以影片本見示。則神情自然。栩栩欲活。石子藝事之工。於斯可見。摩挲再四。爲之歎服不置焉。</p>

<h3>氍毹新語</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>月前本埠各報。盛傳程艶秋將從此脫離歌舞生涯而金剛畫報。且刋有艶秋業已蓄鬍之記載。頃據北友歸來者談及。謂艶秋在二三月前。確抱冷淡態度。後經同業諸鉅頭之勸慰。不久即已捐棄成見。頗有乘機組班之表示。月前適天津新新大戲院派人往邀。經雙方一再接洽。以條件相距不遠。艶秋即滿口應允。數月來盛傳艶秋歇唱改業之說。至此乃得以事實證明其不確矣。惟其原有班底。大多數業已散去。如貫大元侯喜瑞王又基輩。早已歸附他角。一時又無法召集乃將貫王二角。改邀言菊朋姜妙香補充。另請郝壽臣臨時帮忙。以抵喜瑞之缺。新班角色。較舊時更爲齊全。此次艶秋率領大隊人馬。抵津獻藝。其能載譽而歸。蓋可預爲臆斷者也。</p>
<p>以華女士著名海上之華慧麟。其藝術爲小子和李琴仙所授。規矩大方。兼而有之。去臘。偕其師同赴天津搭班。新聲初試。譽滿全沽。報紙輿論。尤多佳評。刻以合同期滿。業於日前乘順天輪返滬。馮李二敎師。亦均相偕南旋云。</p>
<p>坤伶杜麗雲。自拜王一瑤卿爲師後。藝已猛進。聲譽亦駸駸日上。月前出演鮮魚口之華樂茶園。艶譽四起。足與章遏雲金友琴輩相埓。自本月起。改入開明電影院演唱。前程遠大。無限量焉。</p>
<p>漢口立大舞臺經理胡芳庭君來滬邀坤伶潘雪艶。議將成矣。適是時謠言　起。人心皇皇。雪艶恐漢臯地方不靖。售座有所影響。故赴漢之議。業向前途婉言辭却。外傳雪艶以索値過昂而中止西行者。似非此事之眞相也。</p>
<p>徐碧雲高慶奎等。不日即乘輪北歸。</p>
<p>荀慧生貫大元等。二十四日滿期。不再繼續。月底即聯袂返平。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（四十六）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>▲安特萊竇朗AndreDerain（二）</p>
<p>（夢朗作品）</p>
<p>現在我要述竇朗的話了。竇朗的繪畫。在現代歐洲的藝壇是有非常的權威和神力。在於新藝術知識太幼稚的中國藝壇或者還没有幾個人能夠知道這名字。</p>
<p>當野獸派的全盛時期。稱竇朗和佛拉孟克Vaminck爲巴黎附郊的兩個天才的。大約是瑪麗斯·特尼士MauriceDenis罷。那時候他們倆都住在霞渡Chatou。這彷彿是一對不可分飛的鴛鴦。雖然靑年把兩人的强悍氣質接合了。可是在精神上彼此很少相同之點。其實。竇朗和佛拉孟克之間的距離。是一個有大理想的藝術家和一個本能的富於天才的藝匠之痱的距離。而且特尼士講野獸派之時。總把前者列入有名的［幾何學派］Geometres之内。而對於後者。簡直提也不提及。原來後者雖也和前者一様。不外乎出自美術學校。然而竇朗在他的第一張畫布上就已把他的高深的素養表證出來了。至於佛拉孟克的畫面。只是那平民的習見的東西。其一種民間的特性。很是顯然。從來就無可否認。竇朗在專於藉［面］的對比的配置。使畫面上顯出主體之感來。只就這一點而論。和瑪蒂斯立在並行的地位。惟是繪畫的大傳統之對於他。較之對於其餘諸人更爲親近。竇朗的作品。因爲有它那各種情趣。所以含着不少的稀有的錯綜。在簡易的外表上。使竇朗永爲一個驚人的作家。</p>
<p>如說瑪蒂斯創造了一種以裝飾家完成畫家的畫幅的風格。則竇朗實爲從裝飾的纏繞中解放出來的第一人。他把當日在野獸派中所實習的很靈巧地表現出來。而尋打顯露的色調。他曾步趨塞尙Cezanne之後塵。而發現人所未曾覺知的奇跡。於融會貫通了愛克司ＡＩＸ這位大師的一切修練之術。再自己窺探藝術史上最奥妙的所在。從此人們不絶地議論他的對於難解的推理和古義的親近。有人說。那是混沌的才具。欲熔古典的傳統與原始的穉拙於一爐。那是錯雜的智力。一種變調的知識主義。他把十九世紀之末的頽廢派藝術家的精鍊的審美觀念混入古人的愛好之中。原始的藝術有時以其模様的均衡來催眼他。他則再予以某種媚艶。色而當他細心探討之際。在他的同類的藝術中獲得了特多人性的方式。一種比較外來的模範更明晰的傳達方法。他之對于外來的一些模範。僅在它們所固有的裝飾結構上受了影響。他更歡喜重創一些像上古的雕像和中世紀的金地着色像的空氣。因爲他有古癖。所以溺愛純凈的形態。對於往古的精神主義的藝術。終是心怡神往。他畫象時帶着甘美的諧和以及那謹嚴的韻律。有時爲原始人的微笑。他如蜜蜂一様吸盡了神秘的花園中的花朶。雪瑪堡Cimabue奇奥陀Giotto佛格Fouguet。以及摩若克Mosaic的作家和繡氈的製造者都給與這精神的識味者以快樂在他的内心保留一種興趣無窮的紀念。並不是由他的手中創造出來的畫面有時時發出一種異香。乃是人們懂得了近代主義的深味。在於他要使他色彩的深切的諧恊。和他的構圖的熱烈的佈置之方法中就預感到哥諦克文化的精神。他的作品中的所謂哥諦克式是　大戰同時完結了的。他的畫面上的原始主義的精神也從此證實了。</p>

<h3>週末厘拆更無生色</h3>
<p>▲市塲槪况　本週中厘拆兩種業務情形、較前星期益覺冷靜、董各方面鑒於市面不佳、爲防患未然起見、都半抱持審愼態度、不敢儘最擴充、卒現目前之寂象　銀錢兩業、宗旨背馳、各守本分、結果陷市面於窘境、兼之近日外匯、依然未能轉機、現銀進口、絡繹不絶、欲求恢復原狀、實萬不能之事焉</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市洋厘價格爲七錢二分○一毫二忽半、與前日仍同、午市則略小一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分、形勢困頓、毫無生色、（銀拆）疲滯情形、一仍其舊、早市轉賬則開三分、午市銀拆僅爲二分、均與前日上午市一律、劃頭仍白劃無加水、</p>

<h3>絲欵抛盤期洋交易三十萬</h3>
<p>前昨兩日絲繭洋行、對錢莊做定五月半及四月底期洋、共計約三四十萬、價一律爲七錢二分三厘半、並聞繭行及收繭各字號、今年因金融界期洋不肯抛盤、且估量市面狀况逆料屆時不致有抬高之虞、故相率不進、待時而動、卒至未有交易做開、惟聞銀行方面、前目勇存洋戶、儲現備用、是否爲絲繭需要、不得而知、據業中人觀察、泰半係繭欵之備云、</p>

<h3>善後關稅上漲甚巨</h3>
<p>昨日本埠債市期貨賣買活動、現貨做開種類雖多、但成交仍寥落、市塲人心甚好、晨初開出即漲、下午則市上活動買進、漲勢益勁、其中善後、關稅在市上需要最佳、價抬高最巨、關稅近期漲一元八角、下月期則達二元二角、善後均漲高一元數角、又編遣下月期亦上漲達二元以上、其他各約各漲半元左右、金融九六、上落甚微、計金融二萬元編遣二萬七千元、他債進出仍稀、少、期貨全日共開出六百八十餘萬元、内關稅佔二百五十餘萬元、善後續捲各達一百二十餘萬元、續二五整六各計五十萬元、編遣四十八萬元、七年九六金融等均甚清云、</p>

<h3>紗花標紗市極衰頽</h3>
<p>海外花紗雖漲本埠市勢異常衰弱以時局混沌底貨較厚銷路不暢、往後時令落檔　各鄕農事動忙需要未免减縮所以人心多數觀低　散戶抛賣愈衆、期紗本朋跌風尤熾、因賣方　　大批現貨交解、買方視勎不良、將額故出、現順無意收貨之狀云、</p>
<p>▲人標多頭猛出　人標前市開盤、以美棉趨漲、散戶扒空、市氣尙堅、嗣至二三盤多頭賣出、市盤　跌惟　月較堅結果近跌一兩五錢至八九錢遠漲一錢、午後聞現紗需要清淡、多頭仍然結了　檯面頗鬆、五十號前後兩市賣出　千一百包、結果各月均跌二·四·五·錢、全日成交統計一萬七千二百五十包、茲將人標收盤價錄左</p>

<h3>棉市暫難進展</h3>
<p>昨日美棉來電、趨勢甚挺、本埠棉市、賣戶依然缺乏、而漢帮態度仍堅、惟一部份獲利者乘機了結、故市勢略現鬆象、市上現棉、各廠仍無大量銷化、蓋先前訂購印棉、十分滿足也、</p>
<p>▲期棉晨漲午跌漢標前市開盤、以美棉又漲、散戶扒空者頗湧、形勢甚緊、惟近月獲利者了結、祇漲五分、遠漲一錢半、午後市氣稍疲、本月跌一錢五分、遠月跌五分、惟十八號抵進四五十担、全日成交統計四萬四千七百、担茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>上週美棉空戶抵進甚力</h3>
<p>紐約二十一日來電報告一週中之棉市云、上週棉花交易所中情形完全爲抵空行爲、五月期價在一角四分時、則尤形發展、直至星期四五月期價售至一角五分六厘四時、始見稍戢也、此種買風、可信爲同業補進、其在國内外之套賣、而空戶之抵近調遠、爲數亦屬非細、其後以交易轉滯而稍見反動、亦有一部分空頭態度仍强硬、惟大多數要已抵進矣、不過交易之滯下、似將有待於新棉景象之發展、或五月期多頭宗旨有良好之表示也、</p>
<p>又訊、五月期與七月期有軋空之虞、政府對於棉市似漸有格外注意之象、大都商人與廠家乃補進、國内銷費仍滯、國内疋頭成交仍微、市氣稍有起色之象附美棉週末統計如左（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市價高銷滯</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日來船仍不見旺、祇十數號、而本街去化平淡、常帮北　自連連上漲後、銷胃懈而大盤定、惟市况不易鬆落、綠貨客之扳售也、南帮薄稻到銷兩抵、價無上落、羊秈交易見减、杜尖客胃不前、埠秈零拆告靜、大都因價高影響、進戶無暢購之意　白元來貨益稀、買氣無前日之興旺、市價微堅、</p>
<p>▲滬南　河下到貨甚稀、計不足十號、市銷不一、各帮機粳高秀次平、特别頂粳在十九元四五角間、鄕莊胃口略滯、祇店家稍動而已、南路如泗涇·西塘等薄稻及亭林等早稻　主顧均乏進胃、惟普通貨活動甚佳、高貨十七元半、大船殊鮮榮辱、羊杜尖此間仍俏俐、緣貨極凋零也、變陰等元米、因襄路來信又昻、以致申市隨緊、斛數頗旺耳、</p>
<h3>回籠洋米居奇</h3>
<p>昨期洋米繼續上漲　因洋行旣無抛意　且有商議結價一部分之說　致人心益好　而回籠貨隨居奇貨矣遠期各漲三四分近期漲一二分至近角不等惟現貨新到兩船後　本街去化略淡、祇有内地與溫州帮依然健辦、但本街胃口旣呆、人心隨得回平、統市售開現貨一號西貢一千包價十五元小絞二千包、價十四元五角、大絞三千包價十三元九角中次照降、期米計西貢一千噸、小絞一千六百噸、大絞一千餘噸敏黨一百五十噸、均係回籠售出云、</p>
<h3>投機樂觀紛市益鋒</h3>
<p>昨粉市各月份、大致均呈堅俏　三四五月份因小麥逐步回振　業内外之人心、已漸漸回復舊觀、以廠家存底、大致均不足一個月之預備、則靑黃時節　如果粉銷比較活動彷彿供求之間不免發生問題、更以主要合品米之價、本外埠均以存薄之故　頻頻上漲、此種境象似無形中助長粉市之上騰也、觀三四月份、目下已不倒掛、又知前途之癥結　當又從事實上着想也、遠期新粉、以廠家不抛、客戶心思仍佳、故又帶高一點、結果本月份及四月份、較前日各好一分、五月份好一分二厘半、六月份好二厘半、七月份好五厘、八月好七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥參差不一</h3>
<p>昨日期麥各月份市面、呈漲落互見之象、本月份初仍平穩、旋以多頭略有回出、空方已預備實貨因此市氣轉平、遠期各月份以洋麥報價、芝加哥好二三角、坎拿大好七角左右、故人心頗形穩定、推測未來市面、如本月份空方確有準備、當不致發生問題、遠期新麥、如天時未有大變、此種市値、將來恐須看低一點也結果本月份較前日小一分、四月份好一分、六月份好一分、七月份不動、八月份好一分、現貨市况、昨日見交甚寂、因所有高潔之貨、均預備交割、次貨則廠胃不貪故統市祇開南宿州麥四百包、五兩一錢二分云、</p>
<h3>標準黃豆陡漲</h3>
<p>昨日期連豆陡昂、緣大連來電報告漲足角外、現期均開出七元一角左右、因此本埠客帮一致看好　標準近期見昂七分、遠期好近錢、故現連豆高貨已在四兩五錢關左形勢甚秀、</p>
<h3>疋頭疋銷呆滯價都見軟</h3>
<p>疋頭市昨依然跌多漲少、東貨之條子府綢藍條色汀花布等莫不見軟、實以時局謠諑孔多、人心不定　客帮去路、昨因星期六更覺清淡、惟本街成交細嗶嘰直貢緞文明色汀等　有二百多件、各貨中祇第一功直貢緞存貨不多、漲起二厘半、昨售二錢四分七厘半、雙童鹿直貢呢仍二錢三分二厘半、堅挺已久之文明色汀、跌去二厘半、大得利開一錢八分二厘半、梅蘭芳西洋美人均一錢八分、藍條色汀價尙平、細嗶嘰寳球雜色現貨復跌、秃藍灰到二十五、件開二錢六分二厘半、白厚法絨日來本街需要頗殷、昨達磨獅子售二錢三分、富華二錢二分半、俱乃襯絨袍料去路、西貨自時局發生變化後、北方銷塲大受打擊、前欲添辦者均觀望不前、尤以織花洋紗條子羽紗等影響更甚、白冲條蔴紗昨已跌入二錢關内矣、</p>

<h3>南洋土人之生活茉莉</h3>
<p>（三）做丈夫的規則</p>
<p>到了結婚的那一天、男子必須再備一頭牛來表示他的好感、同時、這頭牛還可以殺死了、當作餉客的嘉肴、照例、在成親以前、男子還要經過一套極長的禮節、結婚這一天的牛、土人尤認爲重要、如果這一天、他没有殺牛來餉客、不管他和這個女人已經有了肉體上的關係、或者已經養了孩子、别人還可以出較高的代價、來把他的老婆買去、組魯人對於老婆、並有一定的限制、如果他有牛、他能夠付欵、他喜歡娶幾個、就娶幾個的、但做丈夫的却有一種規則、就是老婆不妨多娶、待遇却須一律、不許愛這個厭那個、而且要公平普遍的愛、不能多愛你一些、少愛她一些、</p>
<p>（四）老婆與草棚</p>
<p>男人一娶老娶、就要和父母分居、但從新建屋、却仍要父母或長輩作主、關於建屋的地址、約有三種看法、第一、不能離開游獵的叢林太遠、第二、新屋左近必須要有一段清潔的土地、可以種植玉蜀黍、第三、要距離一個可以永遠洗浴的水池、不過數十步的遠近、萬一這種地段不能尋得、那末比較差一點地方也行、祇要左近可以種植做土麥酒的原料就是了、他們的新屋、實在是一種草棚、祇有一個小小的門闕通着亮光、進草棚的時候、須要跪着爬進去的、這種草棚、雖則簡陋萬分、但裏面的泥地、却磨擦得十分光潔、</p>
<p>因爲一個老婆、必須建一個老婆獨有的草棚、所以老婆越娶得多、草棚也跟着增多、如果他們的兒女長大了、睡的地方當然是要分開的、所以繁盛的土人、差不多有二十個至四十個的草棚、我們又可以從草棚的數目上面、推想到這個人所娶老婆的多寡、如果是個强壯的男人、他們的草棚生活、並不寂寞、他或者出外打獵、或者設陷穽捉野鹿、或者掘兎洞、或者剥皮、或者做麥酒、女人呢、有時去砍柴、有時去汲水、有時到田地裏去耕種有時烹調、最有規則的、是每十四天擦一次泥地板、</p>
<p>小孩子對於家庭、也有應盡的職務、這便是帮他母親去砍柴和汲水了、此外呢、就是到田地裏去看守猿猴和老鴉來</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>食物吃、等到他長大了、他的職務、就和他父親一般、女孩兒、在七八歲的時候、都是做家庭裏的工作、男孩在這個年紀、牧牛牧羊的他分内的事、</p>
<p>（五）狂歡的轟飲節</p>
<p>粗魯的土人現在雖然漸漸地和我們同化、但他們的古代禮節、仍是盛行、最顯著的、就是麥酒的轟飲、我們一有個用人、呌南弟的、也是一個土人、他晚上常常要去參與這種盛會、任我們没有知道他們生活的人、心裏常常要感覺奇異的興趣、我們曾經問他、我們是否也可以參與、是否可以把他們狂歡的形態攝下影來、他們對於我們的要求似乎也發生奇趣、所以也欣然地應允了、我們又答應拿兩隻野獸來報答他們、所以第二天、我們整理了照相的器具、一齊一邓指定的村落裏去、我們到的時候、全没有一點歡迎的表示、門前連一隻狗也没有、這様躊　着一會兒　、心裏忽然恐慌起來、所恐的就是土人對於我們的攝影、發生反對、所以趁我們没有來到以前、早全　避開了、約莫候了半詞鐘頭、一個穿得很美麗的男人、從草堆裏走出來、他似乎没有看見我們、一直走進草棚裏去、我們又坐了一回、才偷了地到草棚門前去窺探、我們駭了一跳、裏面黑越越地擠滿了一堆人、男男女妇、老老少少都有、</p>
<p>他們的來賓、隨後越來越多、其中有幾個認得我們的、才舉起手來歡迎、到了正午、他們全從草棚裏走出來、這時候我們帶來的一隻鹿、已經放在面前、他們没有一個動手、直等到第二隻野味到來、才一齊剥皮、他們烹調很嫻熟、水早已汲來、大鐵鍋的下面、連柴也放好了、鐵鍋裏面、放了二十加侖濃厚的乳白色的麥酒、鍋的上面、又放了幾十隻碗兒、每一隻碗裏、約莫總有一加侖的酒兒、等到野味快要燒熟了、大家圍繞着這大鍋子坐着、有幾個女人、輪流地斟酒、他們的渴酒、不是大家一齊舉杯、因爲人太多了、碗是不夠分派的、總是一個人渴完、再　給坐在他下手的人、最奇怪的、是他們在渴酒的當兒、一句話也不說、大家都是默默的、尤其在開始渴的時候、彼此遵守着嚴肅的禮節、這様狂飲、竟没有一個不醉、醉了、就没有一點兒拘束、笑謔的也有、犯喊的也有、彷彿換了一種性格一般、我們看了他們起初的神情、不曉得他們有　甚麽樂趣、現在才姚然明白了、在吃醉酒了以後、坐着的圓圈、也要開始破裂、這時候、他們的女人、常常站了起來跳舞、她這種舞法、和我們、西方却大不相同、等到她舞乏了、另外一個接着舞蹈起來、據說每一個婦人、都有每種不同的舞態、每一種揀、都要表示一種情緒、或一種没有實現的希望、</p>
<p>（六）感謝舞</p>
<p>我和我的妻子、坐在一旁、看着他們的異様形態、不禁想起那佈道者從非洲回來的時候、對我們所說的那些恐怖的事情、我們和他們種族不同、言語各異、所以祇有坐着看的份兒、等到女人跳舞完了、男人們又站了起來、預備一齊跳那感謝舞、他們站在那兒、先看那個年紀最大的跳、那年紀最大的、似乎是他們村落中一個最受人尊敬的人、他跳着感謝日光給他們的光亮與温暖、感謝外來人參與他們盛典的美意、他這種跳舞、並不很長、等跳完了、他就以領袖自居、引導衆人一齊歌唱、這時候的酒性、發作得十分利害、而且衆人因爲我們替他們收音、更發狂一般地歌舞着、可惜這時候天漸漸地黑暗了、拍照是不行的、我們就在太陽落山的時候、離開他們的舞塲、我的妻子、至今想着他們那種狂歡的形狀、還是要發笑哩、</p>
<h3>日博士對生男生女之新研究</h3>
<p>▲千古之謎果得進一步之解决歟</p>

<p>（一）但給雌以維他命Ａ及維他命Ｄ、與普通之雄匹配時、多生雄性之子、</p>
<p>（二）給雌以克利斯丹林、亦多生雄、</p>
<p>（三）但給雌以齊斯克能根阿搿能根等卵巢分泌物時、多生雌、</p>
<p>（四）注射神經毒於雌雄兩方時、多生雄、</p>
<p>（五）以白色有毒之有機鹽基注射於雌時、多生雌、注射於雄時、多生雄、注射於兩方、結果所生之子雌雄各半、</p>
<p>（六）以有機鹽基給雄、神經毒給雌時、多生雄、</p>
<p>（七）以神經毒給雄、有機鹽基給雌時、多生雌、</p>

<p>又關於上達各項、博士謂此項研究即可應用於人們者、爲維他命製劑與卵巢製劑二者、其他非待今後應用研究、不免危險云、</p>
<h3>英國之造船實業梁權萬</h3>
<p>這幾年來、英國的造船實業、眞是很利害的拚命的掙扎和奮鬥着、正如其他實業一様、那慘酷的可怖的歐戰、却一時加添了對於輪船的需求、但歐戰以後、這種需求亦漸漸地减少了、如今、可又不同了　、這一二年之中、英國的造船實業大有驚人的進展、那是可觀的成續、一九二九年英國造船的總數、達一·五二五·○○○噸、較一九二八年造船的噸數、實增了二八·○○○噸、老實說、偌大的噸數、實爲英國從所未有、去年英國造船的噸數、總算起來、實比全世界一九二九年造船的總數、還要多二七三·○○○噸、那眞是駭人的數量呀、</p>
<p>現今汔油船的需求、委實是不可掩蔽的事實、爲的是易於駕駛、並且機器所佔的地位不廣的緣故、全世界中、現正在建造的汽油船計有八十五艘、其六二七·○○○噸、其中七十三艘是用馬達引擎推駛的、然而英國却佔了五十四艘、計三九八·○○○噸、那是正在建造中、所以詳細的算起來、英國的汽油船的總量、實佔全球的汽油船的百分之六十三呢、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Three-Power Agreement Theory</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors in the international community about a tripartite agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan. The idea is that if this conference cannot be fully successful, then as a last resort, seek a second-best solution by first resolving the maritime issues and then waiting for a compromise on the European continent at a later date. This can also be said to be half the battle won. However, the interests of the five powers are actually intertwined. There is a tendency to either succeed together or fail together. Those with vested interests in the European continent are not necessarily unrelated to maritime matters, and those with vested interests in maritime matters are not necessarily unrelated to the European continent. Neither can focus solely on one aspect without considering the others. If a tripartite agreement is established first, it will only arouse the suspicion of France and Italy and lead to a feeling of dissatisfaction. Not only will there be no hope of reconciliation between nations, but it may even lead to a dangerous situation. Even if we take a step back, and the French and Italian sides do not increase their resentment and the negotiations proceed without hindrance, judging from the past negotiations of Britain, the United States, and Japan, it will not be easy to compromise. Because in the early days of the tripartite agreement proposal, the United States did not fully agree. Even if it has been approved today, Japan is still unwilling to budge on the 70% demand. Although the government is still slow to respond to Wakatsuki's request, the attitude of the naval authorities has already been clearly shown to the world. Moreover, the interests of Britain, the United States, and Japan are also very complex and by no means simply a 70% issue. Therefore, the tripartite agreement theory can only be regarded as an ideal and is unlikely to materialize.</p>
<p>If a tripartite agreement is deemed impossible and the focus returns to the success of a five-power agreement, then the situation becomes even more difficult. The situation on the European continent is indeed more thorny than on the maritime side. Since the meeting of the French and Italian representatives, not only has there been no sign of a rapprochement, but the French representative Briand has returned to Paris, and Tedesco, seeing no hope of a turnaround, has indicated that he may not go to England. Therefore, the hope of a breakthrough in this area of negotiation can be said to be on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the current naval conference, if it attempts to resolve all issues together, faces such difficulties, and if it attempts to resolve half the issues first and leave the other half for the future, it is not permitted by the circumstances. In that case, will the naval conference waste these months of effort and end without any results?</p>

<h3>The London Conference Nearing Collapse</h3>
<p>Franco-Italian Impasse Shows Little Sign of Resolution</p>
<p>Talks of a Tripartite Agreement Gain Momentum</p>
<p>British Prime Minister's Gaffe Provokes French Outrage</p>
<p>Japan's Instructions Still Require Considerable Time</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 20th: The Franco-Italian impasse is unbreakable. Pessimism surrounds the Five-Power Naval Conference. Its fate is expected to be decided within two to three days. According to sources in Paris, French Premier and chief delegate Tardieu will only return to London if the Conference produces a concrete solution and U.S. chief delegate Stimson secures a provisional agreement with Italy acceptable to France. It remains doubtful whether French Foreign Minister Briand will come to London, as he must defend the Young Plan in the Chamber of Deputies. From the French government's perspective, the political situation in the Chamber is becoming increasingly complex. Furthermore, the French colonial minister, Piétri, returned to Paris today, and naval minister Dumesnil will leave London tomorrow. British Prime Minister MacDonald visited King George at Buckingham Palace today.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 22nd: The prospect of a naval agreement among the five powers – Britain, the U.S., France, Italy, and Japan – is fading due to the unresolved Franco-Italian naval parity issue. However, British, American, and Japanese representatives continue talks. The idea of a tripartite agreement gains traction.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, London, 21st: The disarmament conference is on the brink of crisis. The British government and public alike acknowledge this undeniable fact. Liberal Party leader Lloyd George declared that the disarmament conference teeters on the brink of life and death. A senior official within the government has conceded the conference's failure, attributing it primarily to the lack of thorough numerical understanding among nations. He suggested that rather than persist, it would be better to find a suitable moment to temporarily suspend the conference and adequately prepare for a future one. However, Britain is focusing all its efforts on achieving a tripartite agreement if a five-nation accord proves impossible. This much is obvious. Yet, examining the underlying situation reveals it is not so simple. Whether the U.S. Senate will ratify a tripartite agreement depends entirely on its content. Even the U.S. plenipotentiary might hesitate to endorse it readily. From Britain's perspective, depending on the circumstances, there is a risk of inciting resentment from France and Italy, even jeopardizing Britain's neutral stance in Europe and potentially leading to complex diplomatic relations with continental nations. Therefore, Britain cannot hastily and aggressively move towards establishing a tripartite agreement. Thus, the prospect of a tripartite agreement seems slim and its formation unlikely. Despite the Prime Minister's relentless efforts in recent days, no progress has been made. Two months after the start of the conference, a gloomy outlook still prevails.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Paris, 21st: Premier Tardieu and Foreign Minister Briand will not return to London unless the naval conference's approach changes fundamentally, according to political circles. Rumors suggest that British Prime Minister MacDonald said that treating France like a woman would make things go smoothly. The French press has expressed outrage at this, accusing the British Prime Minister of acting faithlessly and siding with Italy on the naval parity issue. They also claim that the British cabinet is divided on the naval conference, with Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden saying that another conference would risk war.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Naval authorities have yet to draft instructions for the Japanese delegation to the London Naval Conference. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the cabinet must approve the instructions before they can be issued. The earliest possible date for issuance is after the 28th. Therefore, the cabinet did not discuss the London Naval Conference proposals at its meeting today.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, London, 21st: When questioned about the so-called new American proposal, plenipotentiary Wakatsuki stated that the U.S.-Japan negotiation was not as widely imagined to be an American proposal. It was merely a draft aimed at identifying common ground during informal bilateral discussions, not a formal proposal. The British Prime Minister, when meeting with reporters today, also stated that it was not true that Japanese newspapers had reported on an American proposal.</p>
<h3>Indian Independence Struggle</h3>
<p>Temporarily Limited to Destroying the Salt Law</p>
<p>Resolution of the All-India Congress</p>
<p>Gandhi's Group Arrives in Anchi Yesterday</p>
<p>Mayor of Sang sentenced to Ten Days Imprisonment</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Ahmedabad, 21st: The All-India National Congress Committee today unanimously passed a resolution congratulating Gandhi and others for initiating the non-violent resistance movement. The committee also instructed provincial committees to begin non-violent resistance once Gandhi reached his destination, broke the salt law, and announced the unanimous start of the movement, but temporarily limited to destroying the salt law. If Gandhi is arrested before reaching his destination, the provinces are free to immediately launch non-violent resistance. The committee also passed a resolution revoking the membership of the American branch of the All-India Congress because its office holders had engaged in public propaganda, contrary to the policy announced by the All-India Congress.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Jambusar, 21st: Gandhi and others have arrived in Gakikra, four miles from Karali. However, ten of Gandhi's followers are suffering from fever.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Jambusar, 22nd: Gandhi's group stayed last night in Anchi. Police officers came to listen to his speech to report to their superiors. The villagers refused to sell food to Gandhi in an attempt to cause him problems. Gandhi then advised the villagers that starving officials was against religious tenets and that anyone who took hostile actions against government officials was siding with their enemies. Even if General Dyer (who massacred Indians) were bitten by a snake, he would still wish to extract the venom for him.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Austerity Measures</h3>
<p>Weaknesses Exposed, Losing Public Support</p>
<p>The Seiyukai Prepares to Attack</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The government continues its policy of frugality and austerity while also adopting a more proactive approach. Some in the financial world are complaining that the government's ambiguous stance at this crucial time leaves them unsure of what to do. While most in the economic and financial sectors generally hope for a continuation of passive policies, the industrial sector wants a shift to a more proactive approach. The government's recent policies seem contradictory, causing considerable doubt in both financial and industrial circles. Finance Minister Inoue's recent efforts to improve financing for small and medium-sized businesses seem beneficial in the current circumstances. However, the concurrent promotion of austerity and industrial rationalization will lead to the decline of small and medium-sized enterprises. If financing is provided, it will be used for consumption to alleviate temporary hardship, rather than for productive investment. Regarding unemployment relief, the government is simultaneously adopting policies that increase unemployment and others that protect and encourage relief efforts, resulting in a contradictory and inconsistent policy. Because public expectations were initially high, disappointment with the austerity measures is deepening.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Seeing the government as inactive and lacking policy, the Seiyukai has been energized and resolved to use the special Diet session to assert its role as the opposition party. It is currently investigating the government's weaknesses in the following areas to aggressively attack it: (1) inaction following the lifting of the gold embargo; (2) inaction on the unemployment issue; (3) interference in the general election; (4) disruption of discipline; (5) politically motivated use of education budget increases; (6) contradictions in government policy regarding the silk price compensation law; (7) contradictions among policies regarding industrial rationalization; (8) and a dozen other items.</p>
<h3>Stalin Rumored to Resign</h3>
<p>But Denied by Russian Political Circles</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Moscow, 20th: Political circles deny that Stalin is about to resign, saying that even if he wanted to, he would need permission from the party plenary session to be held on May 15th. However, diplomatic circles are skeptical of the political denials. The fact that rumors of Stalin's resignation are circulating widely now, something that would have been considered highly disrespectful a few months ago, shows that his prestige is declining.</p>

An Arab delegation led by Kassim Pasha, including the mayor of Jerusalem and the chief Muslim cleric of Palestine, departed for London today to present their case to the British government.

<h3>Merger of Two Major German Shipping Companies</h3>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>Hankou, He Chengjun, and Others' Joint Telegram to All Newspapers: Please note that we have sent a telegram to the Central Government, which reads: "We believe that 'peaceful struggle' was Sun Yat-sen's cry for national salvation, and democratic centralism is the fundamental law established by the Kuomintang. Yan Xishan, as a member of the party, disregards party discipline and spreads erroneous theories, slandering the Central Government, a crime worthy of capital punishment. The Central Government has been generous and tolerant, forgiving him, being benevolent and righteous to the utmost, hoping to reform the incorrigible. However, the rebel's nature is treacherous and vicious. He publicly resigned but secretly harbored subversive plots. He pretended to go abroad but planned a counter-revolution. He Chengjun and others have been stationed in Beiping for a long time, traveling back and forth between Yan and Jin, and are deeply aware of his intentions. Last year, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi were not well-behaved, but did not dare to act hastily. Yan Xishan, by adding provocations and secretly colluding with them, when the Northwest revolted, he strengthened Feng Yuxiang to secure himself, and when Tang Shengzhi rebelled, he secretly aided the military supplies. When exposed, he claimed ignorance. His intention was to use others for speculation and opportunism. Now, the mask has fallen, and he is even more brazen and cruel. He dares to openly occupy Tianjin and Beiping, colluding with evil forces to establish a false government. If we continue to tolerate this and fail to suppress it, it will spread and be difficult to control, like a prairie fire that cannot be extinguished. We, as soldiers, have been silent for a long time, considering the safety of the party and the nation, and the prestige of the Central Government. We cannot remain silent. We dare to humbly request the Central Government to make a decisive decision and not be lenient. Cutting off a limb can remove the poison, and a good doctor can remove festering sores. Issue a clear order to denounce and suppress him, promote Sun Yat-sen's ideology, achieve peace through struggle, and respect the party's discipline, so that warlords will be eliminated. We are ready to fight and await instructions." We respectfully report this and await your instructions.

<h3>Old Organizational Laws for People's Organizations</h3>
<p>▲Should be abolished after the enactment of new laws and regulations</p>
<p>▲The Central Standing Committee has sent a letter to the National Government instructing its subordinates</p>
<p>The Central Standing Committee believes that the organizational laws and regulations for people's organizations have mostly been newly formulated and promulgated. The old laws and regulations should be explicitly abolished, so it has sent a letter to the National Government, asking to notify its subordinates. The original letter is as follows: "After investigation, the organizational laws and regulations for people's organizations were mostly formulated according to the needs of the military administration period. Now that the period of political tutelage has begun, the old system is difficult to apply. This committee has decided to submit them to the Legislative Yuan for revision. It is now found that the Labor Union Law, the Chamber of Commerce Law, the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law, and the Law on Supervising Charitable Organizations have been promulgated by the government. The organizational laws and regulations for student, women, and cultural organizations have also been promulgated by this committee in order.

<h3>Report from the Ministries of Education and Health on the Case of Restricting Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Education and Health recently jointly submitted a report to the Executive Yuan regarding the handling of cases such as revising the names of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) schools, TCM practitioners using Western medical instruments, and changing hospitals to medical clinics. The Executive Yuan immediately forwarded it to the National Government, which approved the proposed handling. The original report is recorded below: [Case received from your esteemed Yuan's Order No. 4653, approving a letter from the National Government's Civil Service Office, directly addressing Chairman Zhang Meian and others from the Provisional Representative Assembly of the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association's petition to revoke laws restricting Chinese medicine and strategies to eliminate it, in order to maintain the nation and protect the people's livelihood. The Chairman instructed that the Ministry of Education had changed Chinese medicine schools to "Boxi Institutes" and the Ministry of Health had changed TCM hospitals to "Guoshi," also prohibiting TCM practitioners from using Western medical instruments and drugs, making it impossible for Chinese medicine to progress, which violates the late Premier's legacy of preserving inherent intelligence and promoting it. The Executive Yuan should instruct the relevant departments to revoke the aforementioned announcements and orders in order to safeguard it, and it should also be referred to the Legislative Yuan for reference, etc. In addition to notifying them, a copy of the original petition is enclosed and forwarded for review and instruction. Aside from separate actions, the original petition is hereby copied and issued, ordering the relevant departments to immediately comply with and implement this order, etc., accordingly. Upon investigation, in March of last year, the Ministry received a request from Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, for instructions on the method of registering private TCM schools. The original submission from the Lanxi Pharmaceutical Private TCM School stated that, in accordance with an order from the former Ministry of Education in the eighth year of the Republic, TCM schools were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior, and therefore were not within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and could not be handled as usual, etc. In compliance, the regular students who graduated in the twelfth, thirteenth, and sixteenth years of the Republic were all submitted to the former Governor of Zhejiang Province to send personnel to supervise the examinations, and their graduation certificates were all sealed by the Governor, etc. Subsequently, Zhejiang University (at that time implementing the university district system) also submitted a request for instructions on the method of handling TCM schools. Regarding the matters that must be handled by the Private TCM School in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang University replied to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs stating that the specialized schools had been reported to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health, and that the schools should be managed by the Ministry of Education, etc. Based on the above reasons, in this era of political reform, the Ministry should not follow the old system of the former Ministry of Education and evade the management of TCM schools to other departments. However, once a school that has never been managed by the Ministry of Education is transferred to the Ministry's management, the Ministry cannot perfunctorily handle it, nor can it approve all requests for registration and graduation of students from the school. Furthermore, it cannot abandon the current educational laws and regulations to seek an appropriate solution to fulfill the school's wishes. This is the initial difficulty the Ministry faced in handling the school. Also, in March of last year, the National Central University reported that the Wuxi Education Bureau had forwarded the grade reports of 35 students, including Wang Guanxi, from the TCM Research Institute in the county, requesting approval for graduation. Upon investigation, the ages of the students varied, with the youngest being only sixteen years old, and the time spent in the institute being less than one year. It was claimed that they had only studied 16 credits. Although the students were guaranteed by their respective teachers after they left to practice medicine, the training methods and performance evaluation standards for TCM research had not yet been established, and it was impossible to assess whether the theories learned by the students were sufficient for application. Therefore, it was requested to formulate and announce the aforementioned methods and standards for compliance. According to the original report, it refers to the TCM Research Institute, but TCM schools should not be treated in the same way. However, all schools in the country, from research institutes to primary schools, are based on science, while TCM focuses on metaphysics or emphasizes scriptures. Establishing schools has never been based on science, and there is no unified system for training methods and performance evaluation standards. This is an undeniable fact. The Ministry must plan separately to handle these schools. This is the background of the Ministry's plan to change TCM schools to "Chouxi Institutes." As for</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The Ministry's Announcement No. 8 aimed to improve the standards of physicians so that they could achieve good results after starting practice and to encourage those who study TCM to base their research on science. It did not have the intention of prohibiting or eliminating TCM. Now that the Chairman has issued a clear instruction, the Ministry should comply with the revocation of the aforementioned announcement. However, the entrance qualification for universities and specialized schools is limited to high school graduates. If TCM specialized schools above the college level are established, not all high school graduates may be willing to enter such schools. If secondary schools are established, it is unlikely that primary school graduates with scientific knowledge will be recruited. If schools are allowed to be established without regard to qualifications, the current educational laws and regulations will be meaningless, and how can other private schools be managed? In fact, establishing schools for TCM is restricted by entrance qualifications, and it seems unnecessary to compete for this empty name. For the sake of TCM improvement, it seems that scientific research and improvement should be applied to the inherent academic knowledge and clinical experience, so that it can gradually become a scientific theory. Students who study TCM should first have this foundation and then seek further studies. During this transition period, TCM should move towards science and engage in free research. The Ministry now plans to call the organizations that study TCM "TCM Academic Societies," so that they can become academic groups and be managed in accordance with the "Administrative Measures for Academic Groups by Educational Administrative Organs." This measure does not exclude TCM from the school system but provides TCM with the opportunity for free development, not subject to educational regulations. In the future, TCM will become a precise and systematic theory through the research of academic societies, and schools will compete to adopt it. It seems unnecessary to be anxious about establishing schools at present. This is the detailed explanation of the Ministry of Education's revision of the names of TCM schools. As for the Ministry of Health's prohibition of TCM practitioners from using Western medical instruments and drugs, the Nanjing Special City Health Bureau previously reported that the Capital Public Security Bureau stated that the duties of doctors are related to human life and should be treated with caution. Therefore, the Ministry of Health has promulgated regulations for the crackdown on Western medicine. However, there are no clear regulations on how to deal with TCM. It has recently been heard that some people are pretending to be Western doctors for the sake of food and clothing, thinking that Western medicine is popular in society and must be imitated. They prepare stethoscopes and purchase injectors, falsely claiming to be proficient in both Chinese and Western medicine, but they do not know the physiology of the human body and make many mistakes in the injection procedures, treating people's lives as child's play. Such illegal doctors are harmful to society and should be strictly cracked down on to protect social security, etc. The use of stethoscopes by doctors is originally based on academic theory to assist in the diagnosis of diseases. After diagnosis, drugs can be applied or injections can be given, which has a scientific basis and is not superficial. However, some old doctors imitate new doctors, and their understanding of academic theory is unclear and their knowledge of drug properties is even more vague. Their unintentional listening does not know its purpose, and their random application of needles and drugs is even more related to life and must be cracked down on. It is reasonable to report to your esteemed department whether a clear order can be issued to prohibit it. Upon investigation of the items reported by the bureau, it is indeed necessary to investigate and prohibit them. Therefore, the Ministry issued a circular to prohibit it to prevent those who pretend to be Western doctors from endangering people's lives. However, the Ministry will not prohibit the use of equipment by TCM practitioners that is not likely to cause great danger. For example, TCM practitioners use thermometers to measure the patient's temperature. However, when using a thermometer to measure the patient's temperature, it must be strictly disinfected before it can be used on others. Otherwise, infectious diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis can be transmitted at any time, which is not without danger. However, the degree of danger is not as great as that of needles and drugs. TCM practitioners can prevent it with a little attention. Therefore, the Ningbo TCM Association inquired whether TCM practitioners can use thermometers to measure the patient's temperature and was clearly instructed to allow it to be used. As for changing TCM hospitals to medical clinics, it is based on the provisions of the "Regulations for the Management of Hospitals" promulgated and implemented by the Yuan Order No. 893. Only hospitals with considerable personnel, scale, and equipment can be called hospitals. It does not mean that only Western medicine hospitals can be called hospitals. Since the promulgation and implementation of the "Regulations for the Management of Hospitals," many original Western medicine hospitals in various places have been ordered to change their names to clinics because they do not meet the requirements of the "Regulations for the Management of Hospitals." It is definitely not just TCM hospitals that cannot be called hospitals. As for the reason why TCM hospitals cannot be called hospitals, it is because TCM practitioners are only accustomed to diagnosing the pulse and prescribing prescriptions. The disinfection methods in Articles 12 to 15 of the "Regulations for the Management of Hospitals," the use of major surgery in Article 18, and the autopsy of corpses in Article 19 are all necessary skills for Western medicine, but they are not familiar to TCM practitioners. If the same name must be used, the various provisions in the management regulations will be incompatible with the implementation, and non-implementation will be equivalent to being empty. Not only will management be difficult, but also the danger may occur. Because the purpose of establishing a hospital is to concentrate patients, if thousands of patients are gathered in one hospital, and the hospital managers do not have the knowledge of disinfection, the danger will be indescribable if an acute infectious disease occurs. Therefore, there is an order to change the name. It is definitely not the intention to lower the name as the original report claims that the hospital is changed to a medical clinic. As for the name of the medical clinic, if it is considered inappropriate, it can be changed to medical center, medical association, or other names. If the current public TCM hospitals have a considerable scale and can understand the general meaning of disinfection and isolation, they can also be allowed to be called a certain public TCM hospital for distinction. This is the detailed explanation of the Ministry of Health's handling of TCM practitioners using Western medical instruments and changing the names of TCM hospitals. Because of the previous order, it is reasonable to truthfully state it and request that it be forwarded to the National Government for review and compliance.]</p>
<h3>Unusual Movements in Sun Dianying's Troops</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou on the 20th stated that since Sun Dianying's troops were transferred from central Henan to eastern Henan, their attitude has repeatedly changed and their military discipline has been poor, causing great suffering to the people of Henan. Previously, due to insufficient military food, representatives such as Zhan Xuchu and Ge Kunshan were sent to Beijing to request assistance from the central government. In addition to approving the allocation, the central government ordered the troops to be transferred immediately. Sun hesitated and did not move after receiving the order, secretly planning unusual actions. Han Fuqu also harbored deep resentment towards Sun, so he sent heavy troops to the areas of Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Liuhe, and Neihuang to monitor him. Unexpectedly, Sun's troops actually made contact with Han's troops, and after a fierce battle for half a day, Han's troops disarmed a brigade of Sun's troops stationed in Huangzhuang on the morning of the 19th. That night, Sun's troops destroyed the traffic on the Longhai Railway, and the iron bridge about four li east of Mamuji was also demolished. At the same time, the power poles and wires were cut down, and strict defenses were set up in the areas of Mamuji, Guide, Haozhou, Xiayi, Yongcheng, and Huaiyang, intending to resist. The central government has ordered Han Fuqu's troops in Lanfeng to take a large-scale encirclement on the morning of the 20th, and has also sent teams to intercept on the north bank of the Yellow River.

<h3>Recent Financial Situation in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>▲Fluctuations in Central Bank Paper Money and Shortfall in Tax Revenue</p>
<p>▲Statistics of Income from November of Last Year to February of This Year</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou stated that the financial income of Guangdong Province has decreased significantly recently. Since the military uprising in the eight prefectures of Nanlu, most of the tax revenue has been intercepted by bandits or enemy troops. Zhang Fakui's troops once invaded Gaozhou, and all the money and grain in the two prefectures of Gaolei were looted. Although Gaolei has now been recovered, Qiongyai is again unstable. According to news from the Central Bank, the branches of the Central Bank in Meilu and Haikou in Nanlu have completely ceased operations. The Central Bank's uncashed paper money has been slightly affected by military affairs. The Central Bank's five-yuan and above paper money has fallen from 86.7% to 79.5% yesterday, while the one-yuan paper money that has been cashed is still fully used because there has been continuous exchange and there are only 2 to 3 million one-yuan paper money in the market, which meets the demand. As for finance, due to the shortfall in tax revenue, the expenditure portion has not been paid on schedule. The administrative expenses of various agencies in the first half of February of Shun and Hu were paid on March 15, and the expenses in the second half of February will be paid at the end of March. The recent income situation of the provincial treasury is what those who are concerned about Guangdong's finances want to know. According to the investigation, the monthly income of Guangdong Province from November and December of last year to January and February of this year is as follows: (November of last year) Income: Land tax 231,461 yuan, business tax 727,845 yuan, various taxes 730,108 yuan, various donations 243,038 yuan, Shatin income 85,022 yuan, funding (i.e., gambling tax) 996,499 yuan, miscellaneous income 228,706 yuan, total income 3,242,679 yuan. (December) Land tax 316,862 yuan, business tax 211,005 yuan, tax 219,035 yuan, donation 201,915 yuan, Shatin 181,943 yuan, funding 1,005,638 yuan, miscellaneous 937,740 yuan, total income 3,177,038 yuan. (January of the 19th year) Land tax 376,313 yuan, business tax 192,117 yuan, tax 325,913 yuan, business tax 192,117 yuan, various taxes 325,913 yuan, various donations 264,451 yuan, Shatin 101,271 yuan, funding 1,549,978 yuan, miscellaneous 604,714 yuan, total income 2,874,757 yuan. (February) Land tax 288,442 yuan, business tax 21,908 yuan, tax 326,996 yuan, donation 343,637 yuan, Shatin 96,553 yuan, funding 925,292 yuan, miscellaneous 77,530 yuan, total income 2,080,358 yuan. Comparing the above four months, the tax revenue in February of this year was the shortest. (March 18)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui's Remarks After Returning from Harbin</h3>
<p>▲Departure Date for Russia Set for April 10</p>
<p>▲Liaoning Has No Specific Opinions on Russian Affairs</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin stated that at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Mo Dehui, Director of the Eastern Railway, and Zhang Jinghui, Chief Executive of the Special Zone, and the French Ambassador to China, Mattel, arrived in Harbin from Shenyang by car. Many people from all walks of life went to the station to welcome them. Last night, Mr. Mo met with senior officials of various departments of the Eastern Railway at his private residence to inquire about the situation of the Eastern Railway in the past four decades. The officials reported until midnight, so foreign guests who visited were declined. I met Mr. Mo at his private residence today (the 17th) and asked him about his departure date for Russia and various matters before his departure. Mr. Mo said the following: [I will stay in Beijing for 20 days and in Liaoning for 20 days after leaving Harbin. I have reported all the circumstances of the Eastern Railway disputes to the central government in detail. When I returned to Liaoning, I was asked to stay for consultation by the Political Affairs Committee, so I did not return immediately. Although the Political Affairs Committee has held several meetings, it did not participate in the Russian affairs meeting other than adhering to the spirit of the central government's declaration. However, the main issue discussed in the Sino-Russian meeting was the Eastern Railway issue. The Eastern Railway issue is not just one part. The Political Affairs Committee had to discuss it in order to prepare proposals. My departure date for Russia is scheduled for around April 10. Regarding the departure date, I reported it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs when I resigned in Beijing. However, at that time, I only said that I would leave in early April, and the exact date was not determined. I did not inform Liaoning either. I will notify them separately before departure. In addition to Tu Weizeng from the Ministry of Railways and Li Chen from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, several people will be selected from the Eastern Railway because the matters discussed are mostly related to the Eastern Railway. Director Li Shaogeng will also go. The departure date will be formally notified to the Soviet Consul in Harbin after Inspector Zhong (Yu) takes office next week. They will forward it to the Soviet government. We will not notify directly. The Soviet Union has not expressed any opinions on the meeting from the central government's declaration to the present. Before going to Russia, the Eastern Railway Board of Directors will hold meetings as usual, and I will attend as usual. The Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors will be convened as needed. Regarding the Eastern Railway's telegraph rights, the committee only had a few opinions. The central government instructed the ministry to restore the original state first and then discuss the matter further at a meeting. The Communications Committee previously held a meeting on this matter, and I also discussed it in Liaoning and decided that the Board of Directors should hold a meeting to resolve it. There is no need to convene another meeting. This matter can be resolved within one or two days. After restoring the original state, the committee's several opinions will be resolved jointly by the Chinese and Russian directors in the Board of Directors. As for the Russian railway employees who have been naturalized as Chinese, the Russian side has no right to dismiss them. Several people were dismissed because they had excessive behavior, which caused misunderstandings in the outside world.] In the afternoon, Mr. Mo attended the Board of Directors meeting. It was heard that the important agenda item was the telegraph rights issue. The Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors will be convened tomorrow to continue this matter. It is expected that the Eastern Railway and the telecommunications authorities will begin the handover of assets on the 19th. (17th)</p>
<h3>Russian Railway Police Providing Services Across the Border</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin stated that the Chief Executive Office of the Special Zone received a telegram from Zhao Zhongren, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Hulunbuir Municipal Government, stating that there were 39 armed Soviet military police officers in the Manchurian Railway Land Contractor Factory, guarding in shifts. Manzhouli Station is our territory, and police services are related to sovereignty. Please order the railway police department to take over. After receiving the telegram, the Chief Executive Office immediately transferred it to the Railway Police Department for investigation. The two telegrams from the Chief Executive Office and the Railway Police Department are recorded below: (1) Telegram from the Chief Executive Office to the Director of the Railway Police Department in Benbu, Zhang: Director Zhang of the Railway Police Department in Benbu, greetings. I have recently received a telegram from Director Zhao Zhongren of the Hulun Municipal Preparatory Office stating that Sabayka in Manzhouli is a railway land contractor factory, and there are now 29 Soviet military police officers guarding in shifts. Nine of them carry Qixingzi pistols. It has been investigated that Manzhouli Station is our territory, and police services are related to sovereignty. I would like to ask your Excellency to order the railway police in Manzhouli Station to take over the responsibility. In addition to the fact that the Office has seriously negotiated with the Soviet Consulate, I respectfully request instructions by telegram. According to this, all station factories have been watched and maintained by the railway police along the line. This time, the Soviet railway police are performing their duties in our territory, encroaching on sovereignty, which is very inappropriate. In addition to seriously negotiating with them by telegram, it is urgent to order the station section office to follow the usual procedures, take responsibility for handling it, and report back. Seal of the Chief Executive Office of the Administrative Zone. (2) Telegram from the Railway Police Department to the Section Chief of the Three Sections of the Railway Police in Manzhouli Station, Zhang: Section Chief Zhang of Manzhouli Station, greetings. I have recently received a gray telegram from the Chief Executive Office stating that Sabayka in Manzhouli is a railway land contractor factory, and there are now 29 Soviet railway police officers guarding in shifts, etc. Has the station section chief sent police to guard the factory and other places? Why did the Soviet railway police station in the area without permission? Why has the section chief not reported it? You should immediately follow the instructions of the negotiator and report the details by day to be verified. Deleted by the Railway Police Department.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Vigorously Implements Village Afforestation</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang stated that Liu Heling, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, has repeatedly ordered the counties to earnestly prepare for afforestation, and it is especially important to urge the people to plant trees. Therefore, the department has formulated methods for village afforestation in various counties and ordered them to be issued to the counties and forwarded to the village chiefs for compliance. The methods are as follows: (1) Village chiefs and vice chiefs should persuade villagers to plant trees in a timely manner on roadsides, field banks, village heads, house corners, and unused land that can be planted. (2) The number of trees planted in each village should be proportional to the population, with each person planting at least two trees each year. There is no limit to the number of trees that can be planted more (limited to survival). (3) Trees should be planted neatly on both sides of the official roads in each village. The afforestation method may be to plant by dividing the boundaries of each village, or to plant jointly. The village chiefs and vice chiefs of each village shall consider the situation and supervise the residents to handle it. (4) If the seedlings required for afforestation in each village are lacking, they may be requested from the nursery set up by the county, or purchased elsewhere. (5) The trees planted in each village should be carefully protected by the original planting households, and the trees on both sides of the official roads should be jointly protected by the village chiefs and vice chiefs and the residents, or be entrusted to the nearby landlords for protection. (6) Those who arbitrarily cut down or deliberately destroy newly planted trees in each village shall be fined from one yuan to five yuan as a warning. Those who are damaged by young children or cattle and horses shall be fined the head of the household in the same way. Those who illegally fell mature trees shall be severely punished. (7) The trees planted in each village shall not be felled until they have grown into timber, and they must be planted as they are felled. (8) Each village shall establish a nursery to cultivate seedlings for planting. The rules for the village nursery shall be determined separately. (9) Those who are willing to lead afforestation in barren mountains and barren land in each village may do so in accordance with the regulations on afforestation in barren mountains and barren land. (10) The timber price obtained from the felling of public trees planted in each village shall be used to expand afforestation. (11) The types and number of trees planted in each village each year shall be registered and reported to the county government and forwarded to the Department of Agriculture and Mines for record. (12) If the number of trees planted in each village each year exceeds the number specified in this method and the survival rate is above 80%, a request may be submitted to the county government to request awards. If the survival rate is less than 50%, special attention should be paid to replanting the following year. (13) If the places where afforestation should be carried out in each village do not follow the afforestation in accordance with this method, the landlord or village chief and vice chief may be fined accordingly.

<h3>Dangerously Constructed Seawalls in Zhejiang Repeatedly Appear</h3>
<p>The important seawalls from Hangzhou to Haining in Zhejiang Province are related to the farmland and lives of more than ten counties. Therefore, the Zhejiang Water Conservancy Bureau has specially established the Hangzhou-Haining Seawall Project Office to be in charge of the Hangzhou-Haining seawall project. According to reports from various places, many collapses have been found along the seawall, which urgently need to be repaired. After receiving the report, the director of the bureau sent engineer Wang Shoubao to inspect. As a result, it was found that there were two breaches in Jingxin Village, with lengths of about 30 meters to 75 meters, five collapses in Xinsha Village, with lengths of 61 meters, 45 meters, 70 meters, 20 meters, and 35 meters, one collapse in Xinpu, with a length of 37 meters, and two collapses in Shounan, with lengths of about 80 meters. Engineer Wang has now returned to the bureau to report. It is heard that the Water Conservancy Bureau considers it to be of great importance and will prepare a project budget and submit it to the Construction Department for review so that it can find ways to rush repairs.</p>

<p>Jiading</p>
<p>The patrol chief was found to have no anti-revolutionary suspicions. The troops stationed at Nanxiang Railway Station arrested a suspected anti-revolutionary criminal, Wan Pengju, on the 11th of this month. The company commander of the army interrogated him. Wan came to Xiang from Beijing and was received by Yang Dengshan, the patrol chief of the First Public Security Bureau. Two pistols were kept at Yang's house, so it was believed that Yang had a related relationship and was arrested. Now, the director of the sub-bureau, Song Suchen, together with the company commander of the stationed army, is conducting a detailed investigation and has found no related relationship. The matter has been reported to the County Public Security Bureau and forwarded to the County Government for review.</p>
<p>Order to investigate the private sale of rice. The price of rice in the county has continued to rise since the beginning of spring, having already risen from around 14 yuan to more than 16 yuan. The County Government has recently received reports that rice merchants such as Shengtaili, Shunfengji, and Dalong have been shipping goods out of the country, and has immediately ordered the Jiading and Xiangxiang Chambers of Commerce to investigate and verify the matter.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>District Head Approves Funds for Court Establishment: Yao, a court clerk from the High Court, was previously dispatched to Songjiang to prepare for the establishment of the county court. He once consulted with lawyers. Today (22nd), he summoned the district heads and various local organizations to a meeting. The establishment of the county court and the relocation and repair expenses of the Public Security Bureau would require a total of 5,000 yuan. In addition to the 1,000 yuan raised by lawyers, the district heads have resolved to temporarily allocate 2,000 yuan from the interest income of the municipal and rural public funds, while also raising funds to repay it. The remaining 2,000 yuan will be discussed and resolved by various organizations in a future meeting.</p>
<p>Provincial Girls' School Triumphant Return After Sports Victory: At this year's joint provincial school sports meet, Hu Ruisheng, Shen Ruizhi, Lu Xueqin, Xi Shaoye, Zhang Cuidai, Xu Zhiwan, and Tang Yajie, seven students from Songjiang Provincial Girls' High School, achieved victories in various sports programs, winning a total of 30 points.

<p>Water and Land Police Disperse Gang of Bandits: Yesterday, the water police dispersed a gang of bandits attacking Zhu Jing. It is learned that the bandits numbered about seven or eight hundred, exceeding the number of water and land public security teams by almost double. The reasons for their defeat were firstly, Captain He Changlin, after the firearms of Zhang Hanbo's family security team were robbed in Maoqiao, remained on guard day and night; secondly, Inspector Zhang Yunfeng of the district headquarters led a shallow-water warship, and a patrol team composed of elite members drawn from various teams, arrived upon hearing the alarm, adding fresh troops to the battle. At the same time, the bandits' large red flag was hit by the warship's steel cannon and broke in two. With a shout, they retreated while fighting. The bandits considered the broken flag an ominous sign, so they fled. When the firing started, people in Zhu Jing and Feng Jing fled in panic. After the ceasefire in the afternoon, order gradually returned. Strict guard was maintained last night. Two dead bandits were intercepted on a bandit ship, and their heads were cut off and displayed in Zhu Jing Town as a warning. The public security team inspector of Jinshan County injured his ankle. There is no accurate information on the number of water police injured. However, it is known that Captain He personally went to Minhang today (22nd) to meet with District Head Chi to report the situation and request instructions on defense and suppression measures. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, after receiving news of the bandit disturbance in Zhu Jing, immediately telegraphed the Songjiang County Government to investigate and report. County Magistrate Jin immediately sent personnel to secretly investigate the bandits' whereabouts. The headquarters also commissioned staff officer Zheng Qingtao to come to Songjiang for on-the-spot investigation. Currently, post-disaster prevention and maintenance are underway. The county public security team is guarding the No. 31 and No. 34 iron bridges to block the main road into Mao Lake. In addition to the above two iron bridges, Xin Zhen Fanbang, where the three counties of Jia, Qing, and Song meet, located north of Feng Jing and south of Qingpu, is also a gathering and dispersal place for the bandits. Patrol teams will also be dispatched there. It is reported that Taibao A Shu retreated in several directions yesterday, but at the same time, he also infiltrated in several directions. At 3:00 PM on the 17th, Zhang Hanbo's home in Maoqiao, in the western part of Jin County, was raided by a part of the bandits, who robbed a large number of rifles, boxes, cannons, steel wire vests, military knives, and self-defense team uniforms, and kidnapped a member of the security team, Qi Shushan. This group also joined the main force in retreating yesterday. The kidnapped member of the security team is still missing.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Rapist and Murderer Executed: Wang Zhangrong, a resident of Yonglong Town, Chongming County, had an affair with Mao Xu, the wife of his neighbor Mao Kuilang, in the 15th year of the Republic. Fearing that Mao Kuilang would find out, Wang sneaked into Mao's house on the 7th day of the eighth lunar month of that year. He found Mao lying on a table. Wang put a white cloth strip around Mao's neck and strangled him to death. Afterwards, Wang colluded with Mao Xu to hang the body on a beam, making it look like a suicide. Mao Kuilang's brother, Mao Jinfu, discovered the truth and reported it to the county government, which arrested Wang. After investigation and trial, Wang was sentenced to death. Wang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court for a retrial, which upheld the death sentence. Wang still refused to accept it and appealed to the Supreme Court. The third instance rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. After receiving the order, Chief Prosecutor Wang Simao of the High Court sent personnel to the No. 3 Branch Prison on Siqian Street at 9:00 AM yesterday (22nd) to bring out the prisoner Wang Zhangrong, verify his identity, and execute him by hanging according to the law.</p>
<p>Measures for Protecting and Rewarding Released Prisoners: Chief Judge Lin and Chief Prosecutor Wang of the Jiangsu High Court recently received an order from the Ministry of Justice and Administration, stating that the reform of prisoners should be emphasized during prison extraction. However, after their release, they often lack assistance and cannot make a living, leading to re-offending and imprisonment. Therefore, five articles of reward rules for the protection of released prisoners have been formulated and recorded as follows: (1) Those who handle the protection of released prisoners shall be rewarded in accordance with these rules. (2) Rewards are divided into the following two categories: (A) Those who have handled the matters in the preceding article for more than three years and have achieved outstanding results, or who have donated more than one thousand silver yuan, will be given a certificate of commendation. (B) Those who have handled the matters in the preceding article for more than five years and have achieved outstanding results, or who have donated more than five thousand silver yuan, will be given a plaque. (3) The rewards in each item of the preceding article shall be submitted by the local warden to the supervisory authority for review and referral to the Ministry of Justice and Administration for approval. (4) The written request submitted by the warden must separately record the following items: (A) Regarding those who handle affairs: (1) The age and origin of the person handling the affairs. (2) The process of handling the affairs and the future plans. (3) The number of years and achievements in handling the affairs. (B) Regarding those who donate silver yuan: (1) The age and origin of the donor. (2) The amount of silver donated. (5) The rewards in item A of the second article shall be executed by the Ministry of Justice and Administration, and the rewards in item B shall be submitted by the Ministry of Justice and Administration to the Executive Yuan for referral to the National Government for execution. After receiving the order, Chief Judge Lin and Chief Prosecutor Wang ordered the county magistrates, the new and old wardens, and the presidents of local courts to comply with and implement the order yesterday (22nd).</p>
<p>Request for Strict Investigation of Soil Transportation: Duan, the section chief of the Suzhou section of the Jinghu Railway, reported that recently, near the Tiger Hill area, when trains passed by Shiren Shima, opium was thrown out and picked up by armed local militias in accordance with pre-arranged plans. There were also many armed guard groups protecting the transport of opium, and armed personnel engaged in opium seizing, leading to occasional conflicts. Yesterday (22nd), he specially requested the police departments of both railways to send security teams to guard and arrest, and to strictly investigate the locomotives coming from both the Jing and Hu directions.</p>
<p>Reactionary Prisoners Riot in Detention Center: Xu Jiajin, Zhu Jichen, Chen Bojian, Zhu Shunde, and other reactionary prisoners detained in the Jiangsu No. 3 Prison Branch organized various departments in the prison and forcibly forced criminal prisoners to join the riot. Director Xia learned of this and attempted to persuade them at 1:00 PM on the day before yesterday (21st). Unexpectedly, the prisoners dragged Xia into the Jingzi prison cell, shouting slogans to overthrow the director, intending to tie him up. Fortunately, guards Du and Wan, along with the entire armed guard, arrived and rescued Xia. Director Xia telegraphed the Western District and dispatched police to the scene. The four prisoners, including Xu, were sent to Xiaoliuzhen to be shackled and imprisoned in the No. 3 Prison, and a report was submitted to the High Court for approval.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Choice of Section Chief for the Department of Civil Affairs: After the former Director of the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs, Pei Cheng, handed over his duties on the 20th, he hurriedly returned to his hometown that evening. Qian Sunqing, the section chief of the first section, also completed the handover of department affairs and returned to Wuxi first. The newly appointed Director Hu Pu'an, considering Qian's familiarity with politics, still requested Qian to continue serving as the section chief of the first section of the Department of Civil Affairs. He telegraphed yesterday to urge him. However, Qian, due to practical reasons, was unable to take on the role. He immediately telegraphed back to firmly decline and decided to go to the province on Monday to explain everything.</p>
<p>Resolution of Strike by Stone Industry Workers: Stone workshop workers in Wuxi went on strike on the 18th to demand wage increases from employers. However, they had not contacted the employers beforehand. After earnest mediation by the county chamber of commerce and representatives from both labor and management, it was decided to increase wages by four points per worker based on previous wages. Both parties reached an agreement, and work resumed as usual yesterday.</p>
<p>Municipal Committee Ordered to Abolish: The Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office was established in the autumn of last year, with County Magistrate Sun Zuji concurrently serving as director. Initially, it was planned to abolish the county and establish a city, but due to the lack of legal basis, it was repeatedly delayed. Finally, it was planned to establish an ordinary city, but it still could not be realized due to various reasons. Before the former Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Miao Bin, stepped down, he instructed Director Sun to reorganize the municipal office into a municipal committee. After receiving the order, Director Sun proposed a municipal office meeting yesterday to resolve the matter by convening a meeting of municipal discussion committee members. However, news from the province stated that the municipal committee also lacked a basis and could not legally manage the city's municipal affairs. Therefore, there is talk of a clear order to abolish it. All matters to be handled should be transferred to the First District Office. Therefore, the issue of the survival or abolition of the Municipal Preparatory Office is a matter of great concern to the people of Wuxi.</p>
<p>Suspect Arrested in Tragic Murder Case: Yang Xianyi's home in Sibao Lane outside the North Gate of Wuxi County was suddenly attacked by six wandering bandits on the evening of the 17th of this month, who opened fire and killed Yang's eldest son, Quan Jin, and the cook, Wu Rensheng. It is now learned that the culprit in this case was arrested at around 6:00 PM yesterday by the victim Yang Xianyi, together with Xiao Tongsheng, the patrol chief of the second team of the Second Public Security Bureau, near the gate of the Qitai Inn on the road. The suspect, Liu Keli, was taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. Liu Keli claimed to be 23 years old and from Jiangxi, and denied any involvement in the murder.

He was immediately transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Fire Brigade Organization: Merged into Five Major Districts: There are more than 30 fire brigades inside and outside Wuxi County. Recently, at a county administrative meeting, someone proposed to merge the brigades into five major districts: east, south, west, north, and central.

Yesterday, the county government, based on the resolution, sent letters to the Municipal Preparatory Office and the Fire Brigade Joint Association for review and implementation.</p>

<p>Section Chief Injured After Jumping Over Wall: Since the robbery in Xincang, Pinghu County, martial law has been in effect for days, along with various rumors. It is said that County Magistrate Fang received a threatening letter from the bandits, demanding tens of thousands of yuan. For a time, the rumors spread, and the entire county was in panic, especially the government officials. The night before last, the Shen family in Hentangjie fired three firecrackers during a housewarming ceremony. The county government recognized the sound of cannons. County Magistrate Fang and a certain section chief imitated Xue and Liu's old trick. The section chief accidentally injured his leg and waist and was sent to the hospital for treatment.

<p>China Wins the International Football Championship</p>
<p>Defeats Scotland 2-0 Yesterday</p>
<p>First Championship in Seven Years</p>
<p>The spring sunshine is bright, the wind is gentle, and the weather is warm. It is the time for athletes to show their skills. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese team defeated Scotland 2-0 to win this year's Shanghai International Football Championship. At the Chinese baseball field, more than ten thousand Chinese and Western men and women cheered, and the sound shook the earth. The sound of firecrackers was like an electric storm, booming and magnificent. How glorious! The Shanghai International Football Championship, which had never been won before, was won by China for the first time. It is like tasting a rare delicacy. From now on, the magnificent International Cup will also be engraved with the words (China) and the great achievements of the decisive battle with Scotland, to be left as a permanent memento. It is truly a new era for Shanghai's football world.</p>
<h3>Championships Won by Various Teams Over the Years</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Football Championship started in 1908. Except for the four years when it was suspended during the European War, it has been held every year without interruption. England has won the most times, followed by Scotland. Football is the birthplace of England, and their skills are outstanding, so it is appropriate that their record is the best. The championships of each year are listed below:</p>
<p>1908···09 England 1909···10 England</p>
<p>1910···11 England 1911···12 Ireland</p>
<p>1912···13 England 1913···14 England</p>
<p>1914···25 England 1915···19 Suspension of War</p>
<p>1919···20 England 1920···21 England</p>
<p>1921···22 England 1922···23 England</p>
<p>1923···24 England 1924···25 Scotland</p>
<p>1925···26 Scotland 1926···27 Scotland</p>
<p>1927···28 England 1928···29 Portugal</p>
<p>1929···30 China</p>
<p>Looking at the above, a total of 18 years of competition, England has won 12 championships, Scotland has won 3 times, and Ireland, Portugal, and China have each won once.</p>
<h3>First Championship in Seven Years</h3>
<p>Our country participated in the competition in 1923. Counting the years, it has a history of seven years. The first session had mediocre results, but since then it has had a deep determination for international competition. From then on, it has worked hard in training. In the second session (that is, in 1924-25), it was able to meet Scotland in the final. At that time, the magnificent and enthusiastic cheers of more than ten thousand spectators on the Chinese baseball field still hovered in our minds. However, in the end, China was unfortunately defeated 0-4. Although the championship was not won, it was an honor to be able to gain the final right as China had only recently joined. Later, in the 1927-28 session, China and England were able to meet again in the final. At that time, China's strength was very strong, and there was great hope for the championship. Unexpectedly, the Jinan University football team went to Nanyang, and strong players such as Feng Junyou, Chen Zhenhe, and Liang Guansong were unable to join, resulting in a great reduction in strength and a tragic defeat of 2-4. This year, for the third time, it gained the final right and was able to defeat the once powerful Scottish team 2-0 and win the championship. The efforts of several years have now established a remarkable achievement. How happy to have fulfilled our wishes!</p>
<h3>The Chinese Team Had Confidence Early On</h3>
<p>The participants in this competition include five countries: China, Jewish, Portugal, Scotland, and England. Among them, besides the Jewish team having relatively weaker strength, the remaining teams are evenly matched, each with hopes of winning the championship. In the preliminary round, the Jewish team lost to Scotland, and in the second round, China defeated England and Scotland defeated Portugal. Observing the situation of the two groups at that time, China's victory over England showed genuine skill, while Scotland's defeat of Portugal was due to luck. Therefore, for yesterday's final between China and Scotland, the Western newspapers already made a decisive statement, saying that China could assuredly win. The reporter also held the same view. The fierce battle unfolded as expected, with a score of 2-0. It seemed quite laborious, but observing the competitive situation, China had many offensive opportunities. However, due to bad luck, they missed excellent chances no fewer than seven or eight times. Otherwise, the number of goals scored would have been far more than this.</p>
<h3>Goals Scored All in the Second Half</h3>
<p>The match began at 3:00 PM. In the first half, China attacked with the wind, creating a very strong momentum. However, the forwards appeared somewhat disorganized and lacked good cooperation, resulting in their inability to capitalize on opportunities. The audience was very anxious, believing that if they couldn't win in the first half, they would face difficulties and disadvantages fighting against the wind in the second half. Unexpectedly, in the second half, the forwards' connection suddenly improved, and their short passing skills were excellent. Chen Yutian's right wing became even more courageous, and his two crosses were hit by Dai Linjing, allowing China to win the championship. Both inside and outside players were able to coordinate seamlessly, resulting in ample strength, making it difficult for the opponent to develop their game. Center-back Sun Sijing and goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan both performed outstandingly. Among the forwards, Chen Yutian was the best, being small and agile, running quickly. The tall and strong foreigners were unable to catch him. Chen's corner kicks were almost always accurate, making him a rare talent. It is a pity that his passing footwork was too slow, which was his only flaw.</p>
<h3>Scotland Lacked Coordination</h3>
<p>As for the Scottish side, defender [Big Guy] Turner was the best, while the rest were average. The forwards lacked coordination. Even when the ball reached China's goal, they lacked mutual support, thus missing scoring opportunities. In addition, their kicking accuracy was poor, making it difficult to execute plays. There was a disconnect between the forwards and the midfielders. When the forwards attacked, the midfielders often didn't move forward to support them. When the ball was returned, there were often no opportunities to continue the attack. This was a major problem. They didn't show much energy throughout the first half. After conceding a goal in the second half, their momentum slightly improved, and their several incursions caused considerable panic for China. Ultimately, the Scottish team's strength was weak, making their efforts futile. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<h3>Lineups of the Two Teams</h3>
<p>Referee: Smith</p>
<p>Team　Position　Goalkeeper　Inner-back　Right-back　Left-back　Right-inner forward Center-back　Left-inner forward Right-wing　Right-forward Center-forward　Left-forward　Left-wing　Patrol member</p>
<p>China　Zhou Xianyan　Jiang Shan Jing Ning Li Sijing Chen Zhen Yu Tian Jia Lin Dai Linjing Li Huiyong Wang Jian Guan An</p>
<p>Scotland　Robert Turner　Smith Crook　McMorrow Tully Boker Sinclair High Jake Henderson Lewis Lee</p>
<h3>China Immediately Gained the Upper Hand After Kickoff</h3>
<p>After the coin toss, the Scottish team got the right to kick off. Due to fighting against the wind, their strength was reduced. China seized the opportunity to take advantage. Li Huitang used a high ball to pass to Wang Yongjie, who sent it to the front of the goal. Dai Linjing and Chen Yutian went up together. At that time, the opponent's goal was relatively open, and they could have calmly advanced. Unexpectedly, Dai's header missed. A golden opportunity was lost. However, China's momentum did not weaken. Chen Yutian's passes were very effective. The ball fell along the crossbar of the Scottish goal. The Scottish goalkeeper jumped up and pushed it to the rear. Yutian continued to kick a corner, and although the cross was good, it didn't yield any results.</p>

<h3>China Repeatedly Missed Opportunities</h3>
<p>Sun Sijing sat in the center-back position, responding effectively. He intercepted the opponent's counter-attacks from the rear three times in a row and attacked the Scottish goal, but they were all saved. Although China repeatedly missed opportunities, they did not lose heart. On the contrary, they appeared spirited, with momentum like a tide. The ball often penetrated from the right side, thanks to the efforts of right-winger Chen Yutian. Once, Li Huitang got the ball 20 yards in front of the opponent's goal. He stopped, paused, and kicked forcefully towards the goal. The audience thought it would be a sure goal, and the opponent's fortress could be taken down at any moment. Unexpectedly, it hit the foot of an enemy player and bounced back. Opportunities were repeatedly missed, causing frustration.</p>
<h3>The First Half Passed Uneventfully</h3>
<p>Scotland weathered the storms repeatedly, doing their best to resist, and finally repelled the enemy. Then, they launched a counter-attack. Center-back Morrow kicked a high ball to the front of the Chinese goal. Chinese inner-back Jiang Shan fell, and the opponent's left-inner forward rushed forward to seize the ball. After a few steps, he was just about to shoot. Jiang saw the danger and turned back to chase. The ball was blocked. Shortly after, the Scottish right-winger kicked a corner kick. The landing point was very good. After a long melee, finally 克萊忽 got the ball five or six yards from the right corner of the goal and shot towards the goal, hitting Zhou Xianyan squarely. Zhou was quick-eyed and quick-handed, catching it immediately, dodging the enemy, and sending it forward with a kick, turning danger into safety. Afterwards, they galloped back and forth, each achieving something. The first half passed peacefully.</p>
<h3>China Opened the Scoring in the Second Half</h3>
<p>After a brief lemon break, they switched directions and continued to play. Although China was facing the wind, their strength appeared to increase. Li Huitang passed the ball to the right, and Chen Yutian dribbled the ball along the sideline, passing it to the Scottish goal. The ball skimmed the goal to the left. Wang Yongjie returned to the front of the goal. Just as the ball was about to enter the goal, Dai Linjing rushed forward and added a kick. The ball entered the goal, and cheers erupted instantly, shaking the sky. The sound of firecrackers was also continuous. The enthusiastic scene was beyond description.</p>
<h3>Scotland Tried Hard to Counter-Attack</h3>
<p>After conceding a goal, Scotland did not lose heart. On the contrary, they showed renewed courage, like 中瑪琲, trying hard to counter-attack, with a murderous aura. As a result, danger arose in front of the Chinese goal. They were surrounded on all sides, with no way out. High and Sinclair施劲 shot, and Zhou Xianyan almost became the target of all arrows. Fortunately, the inner-backs were heavily guarded, and Zhou Xianyan defended effectively, preventing any losses. However, China had already been frightened.</p>
<h3>The Second Goal Was Kicked in by Dai</h3>
<p>Amidst the chaos, Li Huitang received the ball kicked out by the Scottish right-winger and led the attack, sending the ball far to the right. Chen Yutian tracked and intercepted the ball, rushing past a barrier. He dribbled the ball at full speed, advancing heroically, straight into no man's land. At the same time, the audience applauded and cheered continuously. Yutian became even more inspired, rushing to the edge of the goal and passing it towards the front of the goal. Unexpectedly, no one was there to receive it, ruining all his efforts. But as one wave went, another came. The Scottish goal was surrounded again. The forwards used close-quarters combat, making it difficult for the enemy to figure them out. Dai Linjing kicked it suddenly, and the ball went into the net. China won by two goals. As a result, China's momentum became even stronger, and the shouts shook the sky. Li Huitang missed two opportunities, and Chen Jiaqiu also had bad luck, failing to score, which was regrettable.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xianyan Saved the Ball with Quick Wit</h3>
<p>Having conceded two goals, Scotland was unwilling to accept defeat and continued their efforts, intending to retaliate. Later, they kicked a free kick 30 to 40 yards from the Chinese goal. The ball was fast and powerful, landing right in front of the goal. Zhou Xianyan caught it but fumbled. Jiang Shan added a kick to get rid of danger. Unexpectedly, the Scottish right midfielder got it and returned it to the Chinese goal. The Scottish army rushed up. Zhou Xianyan was wrestled to the ground by the enemy, struggling to break free. Zhou had no choice. In desperation, he quickly threw the ball out of bounds, thus preventing further danger. Afterwards, China attacked again. Li Huitang shot forcefully at the goal, neither too high nor too low, with extreme power. The Scottish goalkeeper pushed it to the rear, showing his skills. The whole stadium praised him. As a result of the fierce battle, China won 2-0.</p>
<h3>The Crowd Cheered When China Received the Award</h3>
<p>After the match ended, the award was presented in the field. The chairman of the Western Football Association, Grishaw, gave a speech, saying that in this Shanghai International Football Competition, the Chinese team won the championship with their true skills, which was admirable. After Grishaw, he presented the silver cup to the Chinese team captain, Li Huitang. They cheered each other and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Pittsburgh But Instructed to Heal Tournament Chinese Victory</h3>
<p>▲Forty-seven to forty</p>
<p>▲Our country's technology is extraordinary</p>
<p>▲Rescheduled for next Wednesday and Saturday</p>
<p>The [healing] tournament between the Chinese basketball team and Pittsburgh adopted a best-of-three system. Last night, the first game between the two teams, following the International Women's Basketball, resulted in the Chinese team winning 47-40. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Smith. The remaining two games are scheduled for next Wednesday and Saturday.</p>
<p>(1) Sea Monster Has Head but No Tail</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is known as the sea hegemon, nicknamed the "Sea Monster," and foreigners call them "Pirates." Their fierceness is evident. They came from the Philippines this time with great fanfare, sending a letter of challenge to avenge America. However, last night, when they faced China, they didn't show much brilliance. They beat the Chinese team by one point in the first half, but weakened in the second half. However, the Chinese team must still be cautious.</p>
<p>(2) Lu Zhong'en Still a Pillar</p>
<p>The Chinese team's lineup was slightly different from when they played against the United States. He Tongwei and Wei Haiqing were in the center forward position, Huang Yunli and Liang Guoquan were on the left and right, and Lu Li was the back. Last night's battle didn't seem as wonderful as when they won the International Championship. However, Chen Zhongen's command was smooth, and he was calm in the face of battle, with orderly tactics, making him the natural pillar of the entire team. Li Baojun's steadiness was universally praised, and Huang and Liang each had their own strengths.</p>
<p>(3) Pittsburgh's Ephemeral Brilliance</p>
<p>When the two armies made contact, Huang Yunli opened the scoring first, and Liang Guoquan followed with four, gaining the upper hand first and boosting morale. However, the Pittsburgh team quickly caught up, taking the lead with 8-7. After that, it was difficult to tell who would win. The two teams were separated by two points. The situation was tense, and the audience opened their eyes and stuck out their tongues, waiting for the outcome. In the morning, the Pittsburgh team actually won with 17-16, beating China by one point. However, this was just a brief flash of brilliance from the Pittsburgh team.</p>
<p>(4) The Chinese Team Sailed Smoothly</p>
<p>The lemon fight continued, with the score remaining close, with a difference of only one or two points. However, the Chinese team suddenly soared. Thanks to the joint efforts of Huang and Liang and Li Baojun's successful long-range shot, they were ahead of the Pittsburgh team with a score of 31-23. Perhaps the Pittsburgh team was unlucky. Center Huaer injured his foot and continued to fight with pain, but his strength was not diminished. Finally, he had to withdraw. Then, defender Parker was sent off for four fouls. The Chinese team had a smooth sailing, winning with 47-40.</p>

<h3>Results of the International Women's Basketball Game Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲England Wins America 34-32</p>
<p>▲The Federation Wins China 29-15</p>
<p>The International Women's Basketball competition was held at the Chinese Basketball Hall yesterday with two groups starting at 6:00 PM (1) England defeated America 24-32 (2) The Federation defeated China 29-15.</p>
<p>▲England wins America. The strength of the American team was unexpectedly defeated by the English team. The situation of the two teams was average. The American team's defeat can be said to be due to bad luck, with dozens of shots failing to go in. The English team's back used an excellent arc, causing the ball to fall in front of the basket. Harrison picked it up and put it in with one hand. England had a smooth run, resulting in a score of 34-32. The referee was Smith.</p>
<p>▲The Federation wins China. China's inability to defeat the Federation was expected. However, the situation in the first half showed that it was not entirely hopeless to defeat the Federation. The forwards Xi Jun, Chen Xinyuan, and Shao Jinying each had good skills, but their lack of coordination was a problem. The backs were weak. The loss was too late, making it impossible to resist Jie Hansen and Ciena's sharpness. In the first half, China won 11-9. The result was 29-15, with the Federation winning. The referee was Smith.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau convened its first meeting with principals of private secondary schools in the city on the afternoon of yesterday at 1:00 PM in the Education Bureau's conference room. Representatives from 32 schools, including Pudong Middle School, the affiliated middle schools of Datong, Hujiang, and Fudan Universities, Southern Middle School, Qingxin Girls' and Boys' Middle School, Zhonghua Middle School, Shibei Middle School, Southeast Women's Physical Education School, Bowen Girls' Middle School, and Zhonghua Patriotic Girls' School, attended. From the Education Bureau, Director Chen, Secretary Ni, Zhou Shang, and Zhang Tianen were present. Director Chen presided, Zhang Yanggao recorded the minutes, and proper etiquette was observed.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Report: Today's meeting with private middle school principals is limited to those that are registered. This is the first such meeting in the city, and I will now outline the objectives of convening this meeting, which are roughly fourfold: (1) [The Education Bureau's Attitude Towards Municipal and Private Schools]: The Education Bureau values private schools as much as municipal schools. Running a private school is not just about providing education and operating a school; it has a public purpose. Investing in a private school without a public purpose is unsustainable and can even lead to rogue schools. Therefore, from a public perspective, the Education Bureau values private schools even more than municipal schools. For the generally good private schools in the city, we will support and supervise them to encourage their progress. Otherwise, we will seek ways to rectify them. If a private school has other purposes, it will be unable to improve the effectiveness of teaching. All the schools present today are excellent, and we hope they will help the Bureau develop education in the city. (2) [Importance of Middle Schools]: Shanghai has over a hundred private middle schools, most of which are registered. Many of the unregistered ones have also reported to the Bureau. The Bureau will establish a system to encourage those not yet registered to do so and hopes that all private middle schools will unite for mutual benefit. Those who obstruct this will be dealt with. It should also be noted that, given the current financial difficulties that prevent the implementation of compulsory education, we are somewhat lenient towards private elementary schools. However, this is not the case for middle schools. It seems that Chinese secondary education last month tended to be dual-track. Middle schools must cultivate both vocational skills and academic abilities for further education. Therefore, the status and nature of middle schools are very high. In today's China, the status of universities is not as important as that of middle schools. Given the current poverty and depleted resources, if we want to stabilize the foundation of the country, we must rely on a large number of middle-level talents. It is only with excellent middle schools that we can have excellent middle-level talents. This is why we are slightly lenient towards elementary schools but strict towards middle schools. In the past, private schools each operated independently, and the administrative authorities paid no attention to them, which was a big mistake. If the education administrative authorities only focus on the schools they directly control and ignore private schools, it will undoubtedly hinder the progress of education. (3) [Remedies for Middle Schools]: The current level of middle school students is lower than before. Middle school graduates cannot cope with all situations in society, especially in Shanghai. This should be blamed on the universities. Nowadays, so-called universities do not consider qualifications when admitting students, resulting in students who are ambitious but impractical. Therefore, those who are not strict in training in middle school will produce many superficial and unrealistic university students. Because universities are not strict in their admissions, middle schools have to accommodate them, resulting in a decline in standards. This phenomenon is regrettable. To remedy this, (a) we have already implemented the crackdown on substandard universities, and (b) the Bureau has requested the Ministry of Education to abolish university preparatory courses, which has been approved. The significance of this is that universities cannot indiscriminately recruit lower-level students through preparatory courses. At the same time, the difficulties of secondary schools can be slightly reduced. Because junior or senior high school students cannot easily enter university preparatory courses, universities have been allowing secondary school students in training to transfer to universities, which has resulted in unaccomplished academics and damaged character, which is extremely harmful. Therefore, abolishing university preparatory courses is a way to promote middle schools. In addition, the ease of transferring schools means that students do not have the opportunity for long-term training and cultivation. In my personal opinion, students who are good at transferring are not good students with excellent grades. We should find ways to remedy this, but we must first have sufficient preparation and a comprehensive plan. This is also a key objective of today's meeting. (4) [Testing Curriculum Standards]: Previously, different schools in different regions had different curricula, and teaching could not be improved. It was not until last year that the Ministry of Education issued regulations on curriculum standards. However, due to the need for universality, they cannot be suitable for all places. But with this standard, we can have something to follow. Now, the Bureau has drafted trial middle school curriculum standards according to needs and distributed them to schools for testing. In the future, each school will report the results of the tests to the Bureau, so that we can present them to the Ministry of Education as a basis for revision. The Education Bureau hopes that today's meeting will become a channel of communication between teaching and administrative agencies, so as to solve the difficulties of both sides. In addition, there are two other things: (1) The Education Bureau is now trying to support the development of private middle schools and does not intend to take them over after they have developed. This should be stated responsibly because it is our duty to promote the development of private schools. (2) The names of private schools should be unified. Many schools are called "Gongxue," "College," or "Elementary and Secondary School," which makes it difficult to understand their nature. They should be renamed "High School," "Junior High School," or "Middle School." If there is an elementary school, it should be called "Affiliated Elementary School." The four points I had to report are now complete. I will now ask the head of the relevant department to report. I will leave beforehand. Secretary Ni, who is also the department head, will chair the report later.</p>
<p>▲Principals' Reports: Each principal presented the difficulties of their respective schools in detail. The chairman responded to each item one by one.</p>
<p>▲Discussion: (1) Discussed and approved the standard for student tuition fees; (2) Discussed and approved the standard for student boarding fees; (3) Discussed and approved the standard for various miscellaneous fees. It was decided that the Education Bureau would collect forms from each school for statistical analysis before making a decision; (4) Discussed methods for schools to recruit transfer students. It was decided that schools should not recruit students into the third year of junior high school or the third year of high school. Other grades may be recruited, but they must obtain a transfer certificate or transcript and pass a transfer examination. For students with excellent academic performance who use a credit system, increase the credits for the next semester. For those who use a semester system, the ability grouping system can be used to develop their abilities; (5) Discussed the establishment of a public science laboratory for private secondary schools in Shanghai Special Municipality. It was decided that each private school would automatically organize and then the Bureau would provide support; (6) Discussed whether extracurricular activities should be given credit. It was decided that each school could give credit for extracurricular activities, and the results must be reported to the Bureau; (7) Discussed the establishment of a circulating library for private secondary schools in Shanghai Special Municipality. It was decided that the Bureau would try to request funds from the municipal government to establish it, and each private school would participate together; (8) Discussed urging the British and French Concession authorities to ban prostitution.</p>
<p>It was decided that the Bureau would send a letter to the municipal party headquarters and the Chinese Education Office of the Concession to request the municipal government to stop it and to pay more attention to training in schools. The meeting adjourned at half-past five.</p>
<h3>Private Preparatory School for Studying in France</h3>
<p>▲Failed to Comply with Regulations and Obtain Approval for Establishment</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau sent a letter to various newspapers yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern: It has been discovered that someone has newly established a private preparatory school for studying in France within the campus of the East Asia University, which was ordered to be closed on Avenue Joffre. Without first complying with the regulations for private schools and obtaining approval for its establishment, it has immediately begun operations. In accordance with the decree issued by the Ministry in January of this year, which stipulates that secondary schools and higher established after February 1st of this year that have not been approved are prohibited from enrolling students, the aforementioned preparatory school is hereby prohibited from enrolling students. We are writing to inform your newspaper that all enrollment advertisements and school news from the aforementioned preparatory school should not be published. We would be grateful for your cooperation. Sincerely."</p>

<h3>Jianghai Customs Superintendent Awaits Transfer</h3>

<h3>Chen Shiguang Continues to Inventory Documents from the Discussion Committee</h3>

<h3>No Progress in Discussions on Improving Concession Telephone Issues</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the telephone issue in the concession is complex, with conflicting opinions, and may not be resolved in the short term. The current problem stems from the outdated equipment and insufficient funding of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, which has led to widespread criticism from the public. The Public Works Department began to take action several months ago but initially seemed to only negotiate directly with the company. Later, it established an advisory committee to discuss the matter and consider the bids from three companies: International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corporation, Ericsson Company, and Cables and Wireless. As a result, the terms of the franchise for the municipal authorities of the two concessions became a problem. Of the three bids, two companies' financial and business plans were largely based on the existing franchise rights of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, while the third company attached a proposal to revise the franchise. For the past two months, the Public Works Department and the Conseil d'Administration have been consulting back and forth but have been unable to agree on a common policy. Matters such as the new company's dividend rate (8% or 1%), the franchise term (10, 20, or 40 years), the future telephone rates, and the revision of the term have all become points of contention between the two parties. The meeting last Monday also made no progress. The Conseil d'Administration seems to be motivated by the Public Works Department's mismanagement of business, and therefore did not agree to the Public Works Department's latest proposal. There are rumors that the French Concession intends to form its own telephone company, but the authorities are currently still in the process of deliberate consultation. Telephone users, shareholders, the advisory committee, and bidding companies are becoming impatient. The prolonged delay means that the telephone company will be unable to expand, the work of the advisory committee will be in vain, and the time and money spent by the representatives of the bidding companies will be for naught.</p>

<h3>Ministry Order on Preserving Old Archives</h3>

<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The management insisted on absolute obedience to the city government's approval, giving priority to re-employment. The labor side insisted on implementing full placement as mandated by the Party. Chairman Guo then offered his opinion, stating that the Bureau had already formulated a plan for this mediation. The management should first re-employ the pharmaceutical workers registered with the Bureau, and the labor side should not make excessive demands. However, both parties expressed dissatisfaction with this plan. As the clock struck ten, Chairman Guo announced the adjournment and scheduled another mediation for next Monday.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the labor side revisited the City Party Headquarters to petition, resulting in a highly satisfactory outcome. It is generally believed that after the mediation on Monday, there should be no further issues.</p>

<h3>Construction Bureau Solicits Silk Products for Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an instruction from the Jiangsu Construction Bureau, stating, "Upon receiving an instruction from the Provincial Government, approving a consultation from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that silk is a special product of our country, traditionally used for clothing and a major export.

<h3>German Committee for Investigating Chinese Tea Arrives in China</h3>
<p>▲Mr. Sugen Has Already Departed</p>
<p>▲Expected to Arrive Mid-Next Month</p>

<h3>Yangsi District Prepares to Establish Cotton Planting Cooperative Experiment Farm</h3>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Exemption from National Product Alkaline Powder Tax</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce wired the Zhenjiang Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "The Yancai Miscellaneous Goods Industry Association believes that the tax office is levying a tax on alkaline powder used by factories. On the 17th of this month, Henry Alkali Factory reported this and telegraphed to your office requesting verification and prohibition. Now, Henry Alkali Factory has sent a letter stating that the Chinese alkaline powder used by the factory is purchased from the Yongli Alkali Manufacturing Company, managed by Jiuda Refined Salt Company, with a formal agreement established. A copy of the shipping document based on the original case approved by the Ministry to exempt the alkaline from levee tax for five years has been attached to the meeting. It is found that Yongli Alkali Manufacturing Company is located in Tanggu, and according to the general method of taxing foreign goods, after paying the export tax at the Tianjin Customs, it can circulate throughout the country, and no more taxes should be levied. Moreover, Yongli alkaline powder has been specially approved for exemption from tax for five years, and the time limit has not yet expired. The tax office is a type of contracted levee collector, and how can it levy a tax on the alkaline powder that has been approved by the Ministry to be exempt, thus disregarding the law and disturbing merchants? According to the previous situation in the letter, a copy of the shipping document is attached and sent to your office requesting verification. Please refer to the previous case and transfer the instructions for compliance with the regulations. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee."</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi Returns to Shanghai Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Preparing the Second Batch of Exhibits for the Competition</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, the representative of our country participating in the Belgian Expo, returned to Nanxun some time ago to visit his ailing father. It has been learned that his father is gradually recovering, and Mr. Chu, with the trip to Belgium imminent, returned to his Shanghai residence yesterday afternoon to prepare the second batch of exhibits for the competition.</p>
<h3>Notes on Chu Minyi's Speech at the Global Student Association</h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM last night, Central Committee member Chu Minyi, at the invitation of the Global Chinese Student Association, came to the association to give a speech entitled [Methods and Purposes of Physical Education]. In addition to members of the association, students from more than a dozen well-known universities in this city were present, and the hall was already full before 7:00 PM. After Chairman Zhu Shaoping gave a speech, Mr. Chu was invited to speak. The following is a brief record of his speech: [The purpose of physical education is to maintain our health permanently. As Western philosophers have said, "A sound mind dwells in a sound body." Only when our physique is sound can we be motivated to act with vigor. Examining the techniques of various sports, such as ball games, track and field, martial arts, gymnastics, as well as horse racing, boat racing, and swimming, cannot be said to be non-physical education methods. However, their methods are not perfect, and may even be too intense, leading to harm to the body, which runs counter to the original purpose of physical education. Therefore, the physical education methods that I advocate are pure, peaceful, leisurely, and simple. Their function is to make the muscles and bones of the whole body move and the meridians relaxed. They do not value the fierce and dangerous movements of leaping and kicking. Only in this way can the goal of improving health be achieved. In terms of methods, Taijiquan is the best. Taijiquan has three major advantages: time efficiency, money efficiency, and energy efficiency, which other sports cannot match. I will explain them separately as follows: (1) Other sports take a lot of time, and most of them are biased towards one part, inevitably leading to neglect of the others. If Taijiquan, it can be completed in five minutes. Twenty minutes a day is more than enough, and it can make the muscles and bones of the whole body move and the meridians relaxed. There is no time efficiency better than this. (2) The modern social economic organization is poor, and the gap between the rich and the poor is huge. In terms of physical education, the poor who intend to practice self-cultivation in mild exercise are often discouraged because they cannot afford to buy equipment. As for the movement of ball fields, ships, and carriages, it is only enjoyed by a few people, and the poor have no part in it. Taijiquan does not require expensive tools, only two kinds of balls and sticks. It can be done independently or jointly with the public. It does not require a wide field and can be done indoors. It does not require a special teacher and can be obtained privately. There is no money efficiency better than Taijiquan. (3) All sports require effort, especially intense sports. Too much effort will inevitably lead to fatigue, which indirectly reduces the power of social service and directly harms the individual's physiology. Our strength is so precious, how can we waste it on exercise, not knowing the way of economy, and contrary to the purpose of exercise? Taijiquan does not waste useful strength, is neutral, peaceful, leisurely, and unhurried, and is the most active exercise among soft exercises. It can prevent paralysis in old age and become a useless person. This is the most appropriate conditioning method and a preventive method for diseases. Excessive exercise and excessive work for laborers have the same destination. People always think that the more labor, the more the production efficiency will increase, but they do not know that the opposite is true. Taijiquan not only saves strength but also stores strength. Energy efficiency is rare. The function of Taijiquan is so great, but people may be afraid of difficulty and dislike a section, which takes a month to complete, and the full achievement is not easy, so they retreat and discourage. Regarding this point, I have already found a quick method and a remedial method, and created simple equipment for people to exercise on their own. There is no need for regular learners to follow the steps and abide by the rules. Spend a few minutes a day to pass the time on this. If you practice for a long time, you will naturally become healthier. Finally, the two kinds of ball sticks used in Taiji New and the manufacturing and application methods of the equipment are very detailed. (Detailed speeches will be published in the publications of the association.) After the speech, the audience stood up and thanked Mr. Chu and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Huang Jiaohui Discusses the Opium Disaster in the Malay Peninsula</h3>
<p>The opium disaster in the East Indies has been reported in previous newspapers by Huang Jiaohui, the director-general of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, who was sent to Nanyang for investigation and reported to the association's staff. Huang's investigation into the opium disaster in the British Malay Peninsula was particularly detailed, and he obtained a wealth of materials. Yesterday, he briefly described the following to the association. There are more than two million overseas Chinese in the Malay Peninsula and the Straits Settlements. There are no accurate statistics on smokers, but according to reliable estimates, at least 20% of the population smokes opium. In comparison to China, the situation is even more serious. There are virtually no Malay natives who smoke opium. Almost all of the victims are overseas Chinese. According to a survey of the population, only 13% of overseas Chinese smoke opium. A survey of smokers in opium dens found that 80% of them became addicted to opium after arriving in British territory. A survey of smokers in various hospitals found that 71% of them became addicted after arriving in British territory. It can be seen that the monopoly system has a great relationship with the spread of opium addiction among overseas Chinese. According to survey statistics, in 1928, the Straits Settlements Government Monopoly Bureau purchased 2,027 boxes of Indian opium and 950 boxes of Persian opium, for a total of 2,977 boxes. The public sales bureau produced and sold 3,199,998 taels of opium. In addition, 13,551 taels of privately obtained opium were found and transferred to public sales. The government set up public sales stores and opium dens in bustling markets, paying particular attention to factories, workplaces, rubber plantations, and tin mines. Government opium revenue accounted for 40% of the total revenue. In 1928, the total revenue of the Straits Settlements was 12,222,263 yuan, the Federated Malay States 11,782,128 yuan, Kedah 2,052,564 yuan, Kelantan 4,355,848 yuan, Terengganu 291,570 yuan, Perlis 206,508 yuan, Johor 4,224,465 yuan, Brunei 79,447 yuan, British North Borneo 93,498 yuan, Sarawak 951,118 yuan, and Hong Kong 2,582,101 yuan, totaling 35,021,510 yuan, equivalent to approximately 50 million Chinese yuan. In 1929, the Straits Settlements' opium revenue was 9.6 million yuan, and the budgeted revenue for 1930 increased to 12.75 million yuan. Other places are not included. It can be seen that the local government has no sincerity in prohibiting opium. In terms of tax revenue, the government currently has accumulated tax revenue exceeding the administrative expenses by 72 million yuan, a currency surplus of 21 million yuan, and accumulated opium tax revenue of 44 million yuan, for a total of 138 million yuan. The interest from this huge sum is enough to offset the opium tax and more, but the authorities are still trying to expand opium sales and add opium dens, which is alarming. Previously, an overseas Chinese in British territory had established anti-drug organizations in many places, advocating opium cessation and sparing no effort. However, after repeated unexpected obstacles, it was discontinued. This time, Mr. Huang went to various places in British territory to discuss the organization of anti-drug organizations with important overseas Chinese figures and public groups, which was well received. Various groups and local dignitaries in Singapore have jointly organized an anti-drug association and are actively proceeding. It is expected that other places will soon follow. It is heard that Mr. Huang's detailed report is currently being compiled.</p>

<h3>Xie Baosheng's Son, Comprador of Xinming Shipping Company, Kidnapped</h3>
<p>▲Sudden Attack During the One-Month-Old Celebration Banquet</p>
<p>▲Guests Closely Monitored, Serious Situation</p>
<p>▲Kidnapping and Robbery at Sea, Unheard Of</p>
<p>▲Bandits' Cunning Plan for an Easy Escape</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 7:30 PM, a kidnapping case of a seven-year-old boy occurred at No. 871, Qunshou Lane, Baker Road. The kidnapped boy was Songtao, the son of Mr. Xie Baosheng, the comprador of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinming ship. The kidnappers also robbed gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and other items. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>▲Banquet Full of Guests and Friends Xie Baosheng is well-known at sea and has many friends. His old residence was originally at No. 739, Wufu Lane, Avenue Edward VII. His concubine, Ms. Li, is the daughter of yarn merchant Mr. Li Mingzhai. Ms. Li lives at No. 817, Qunshou Lane, Baker Road. Ms. Li also lives in her mother's home and has two sons. The elder is Songtao, who was kidnapped, is seven years old, and the younger one was recently born and has just turned one month old. A large one-month-old celebration banquet was held at home in the evening, with the banquet full of guests and friends, totaling about twenty people. While everyone was cheering and drinking, six uninvited guests suddenly broke in. The guests initially thought they were more guests coming to congratulate them, and paid no attention.</p>
<p>▲All Guests Closely Monitored Who knew that four of the newcomers were dressed neatly, but the host did not entertain them, and the guests did not immediately take their seats. The guests were wondering what was going on. At this moment, the neatly dressed newcomers suddenly pulled out pistols and monitored Li Mingzhai's actions. Only then did the guests realize the seriousness of the situation and had to remain silent, temporarily losing their freedom. Two more uninvited guests, taking advantage of this serious situation, also drew their guns and hurried upstairs.</p>
<p>▲Two Suitcases of Clothes and Jewelry Taken Upstairs At that time, there was no one upstairs. The two uninvited guests grabbed two suitcases and carried them downstairs. Judging by the intent of the uninvited guests, they initially intended to kidnap someone but did not intend to rob anything. However, because there were so many guests and many children, they could not find a hostage in a hurry, which led to unexpected complications. They first grabbed the suitcases. The suitcases contained valuable leather clothing and jewelry. After the two uninvited guests carried the suitcases downstairs, they went directly to the courtyard, threw the two suitcases on the ground, opened them with force, and arbitrarily searched for clothing and jewelry. Everyone was still under surveillance and could do nothing about it. The hostage, Songtao, was also identified by the thieves among the people.</p>
<p>▲Living Hostage Captured On the Spot While the two uninvited guests were taking clothes and jewelry, the four uninvited guests monitoring the room also acted together, grabbing Songtao and taking him out. Everyone in the room could not help. Ms. Li wanted to cry but had no tears, and was extremely frightened. The maternal grandfather, Mingzhai, with his old eyes and poor vision, trembled almost without color. The two uninvited guests in the courtyard, after the hostage was taken away for ten minutes, also packed up their loot, concealed their pistols, and added Mingzhai's fox fur coat to themselves. However, the size did not fit, so they reluctantly put it on, preparing to leave.</p>
<p>▲Trying to Chase the Bandits' Scheme At that time, Ms. Li's younger brother, seeing that the uninvited guests had concealed their pistols, suddenly became bold. He followed them out, and the guests followed behind him. Seeing that the pursuers were close, the bandits, fearing arrest, had an idea. They immediately stopped, took off the fox fur coat, and threw it on the road, preparing to counterattack. Ms. Li's younger brother, fearing that they would take out their pistols again and be killed, had to retreat. However, the bandits dared to chase back. At that time, a patrolling Indian constable with a pistol happened to be passing by. He mistakenly thought that Li's younger brother was a thief. When Li's younger brother saw the Indian constable, he shouted wildly, "Kidnapping!" However, the Indian constable still could not distinguish the truth from falsehood. In the blink of an eye, the bandits took the opportunity to escape without a trace. ▲Reporting to the Police Station and Requesting Investigation Afterwards, Ms. Li's younger brother reported to the Xinzha Police Station and requested an investigation. When Mr. Xie Baosheng heard the news and rushed over, his beloved son had been kidnapped far away. It is said that Mr. Xie, although having a reputation, is outwardly strong but inwardly weak and has no savings. It is not known how this matter arose due to a misunderstanding. It is said that the kidnappers shouted for a ransom of 2,000 yuan when they left.</p>

<h3>Bandit Wu Zunyi Sentenced to Five Years</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei bandit Wu Zunyi, this spring, gathered a gang and armed with weapons, broke into Wanlong Sauce Garden at No. 632 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession and Maochangxiang Southern Goods Store at No. 142 Kangti Road, robbing them of silver dollars. They divided the loot and fled. Detectives and supervisors Jin Jiulin, Zheng Tanmu Li Yaolong, Bao Tan Zhou Buguang, Chen Jinshu, Xu Guilin, and others from the French Concession Police Station investigated, arrested Wu, and seized a pistol. They then arrested two suspects, Wang Axiao and Zheng Yuzhen, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were taken to the French Court for trial. The plaintiffs, Wang Fuqing and Guo Yuanmao, testified about the circumstances of the robbery. When questioned, Wu Zunyi confessed to the robbery. Wang and Zheng testified that although they were acquainted with Wu Zunyi, they did not dare to commit robbery and requested a clear investigation. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Wu to five years in the Western prison, and upon completion, he would be permanently expelled from the concession. The seized pistol was confiscated. Wang and Zheng were found not guilty and released.</p>
<h3>Yuanhe Pawnshop Fire Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>The Yuanhe pawnshop opened by Yu Zhaosheng on Rue du Père Froc in the French Concession caught fire a few days ago. The Fire Brigade rushed to extinguish the fire. Afterwards, the police summoned Yu to the French Court for questioning. The court ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire before a decision could be made. Yesterday, Yu was summoned again. Mr. Bahe, the lawyer representing the defendant, Yu Zhaosheng, the owner of Yuanhe pawnshop, stated that the pawnshop had a very good business every year. Although it had fire insurance of 22,000 taels, the burnt goods were worth 60,000 to 70,000 gold yuan. The fire was caused by someone throwing a cigarette butt into the back window out of jealousy. He added that if evidence of this person is found in the future, they would be investigated and prosecuted. After deliberation, the Chinese and Western judges ruled that since it was confirmed that the fire was unintentional, the case would be dismissed.</p>

<p>▲ Over Ninety Men and Women</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Industrial and General Union reported yesterday that the Guangdong branch had received a letter from the Guangzhou Municipal Social Bureau requesting assistance in transporting over ninety Shandong refugees, including Gao Gencao, back to their hometown. The union had contacted the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which arranged for the Guangda steamship to transport them to Shanghai. The original text of the letter is as follows: The Guangzhou Municipal Social Bureau stated, "According to Gao Gencao, a Shandong refugee, he and more than ninety others suffered from locust plagues and floods last year and drifted to this area. They are now camping in the open space in front of the Tianhou Temple in Caofang, Henan, and it is difficult to find food. As the spring farming season begins, they urgently want to return home to farm to avoid staying in a foreign land for a long time. However, they have no travel expenses and cannot return. They request assistance." After sending personnel to investigate, it was reported that there were a total of ninety male and female refugees, young and old. Some make and sell bamboo products or small toys to make a living, while others beg for a living. They are hungry and cold, and their situation is pitiful. When asked, all the refugees expressed their willingness to return to their hometown and should be helped. Therefore, this bureau is sending Li Yingjun and Mo Jing to your union to discuss the repatriation method. We hereby inform you and hope that you will contact us, discuss the matter properly, and respond accordingly. After approval, personnel were sent to the Guangdong branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which agreed to send the refugees to Shanghai on the Guangda steamship on the fifth of this month. The bureau was informed and ordered to handle the repatriation matters according to schedule and to inform the Shanghai Social Bureau to arrange for their transportation back to their hometown upon arrival. The handling of this case is hereby reported for your review."</p>

<h3>Two Engineering Societies to Merge</h3>
<p>Hu Shuhua, Xu Peihuang, Xue Cixin, members of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and Hua Nangui, Xia Guangyu, Tang Zaixian, members of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and Ling Hongzhu, Wei Yifu, Wang Shengshan, and other nine members of both societies, feel that it is necessary to unite the engineering academic organizations in our country, so they put forward a proposal for the merger and sent it to the members of both societies, hoping to resolve and realize it as soon as possible. After the merger, the total number of members of the two societies will be more than 5,000. The proposal is recorded below:</p>
<p>It is found that there are two domestic engineering academic organizations with a certain history and status. (1) The Chinese Institute of Engineers. (2) The Chinese Institute of Engineers. Their history and current status are approximately as follows: A. The Chinese Institute of Engineers was established in the early years of the Republic of China. The general headquarters are in Shanghai, and the branches are in Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Hangzhou, Jinan, Taiyuan, Suzhou, Fengtian, Wuzhou, and the United States. There are about 1,300 members, and some of them are self-employed industrialists and businessmen. The association publishes four issues of the association journal and one special issue of the association journal every month. There is a material testing laboratory in Shanghai, with a base and a fund of more than 20,000 yuan. B. The Chinese Institute of Engineers was initiated by Dr. Zhan Tianyou and others at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The general headquarters are in Peiping, and there are more than 400 members. Many of the seniors in the road industry are in it. It publishes one issue of the association bulletin every month. There is a general house in Peiping and some funds. In addition, the organization within the association, the qualifications of members, the collection of membership fees, and the progress of association affairs are similar, although the articles of association of the two associations are not exactly the same. The two associations have the same academic and professional standpoint, the same purpose, and a similar organization, and some of them are common members. However, because the organizations did not contact each other at the beginning, they went their separate ways. In the past, they were each in their infancy, and the two associations coexisted. In recent years, the construction industry has flourished, and the two associations have evolved for more than ten years and have a considerable position in the society. If they continue to have no contact with each other, it will have a major obstacle to the future of engineering academics, engineering careers, and engineering talents. The main points are as follows: (1) The organization is divided and cannot concentrate talents and careers to achieve the same goal. (2) There are members of the engineering community who are also members of the two associations, and it takes twice the effort to handle association affairs. (3) For suggestions and requests to the country or consultations belonging to the government and society, they cannot be expressed or dealt with as a whole. (4) For the liaison with domestic and international academic circles, there are two associations with the same nature, which are easy to confuse and cause estrangement. The proposers are members of the Jia association, members of the Yi association, or members of both associations. In order to concentrate the strength of the engineering community to seek the research progress of engineering academics and the observation and development of engineering careers, it is proposed to merge the Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Chinese Institute of Engineers into a national engineering institute, and request the immediate notification of all members by the two authorities to solicit their consent. At the same time, each association should organize a committee to study and proceed, and hold a joint congress of the two associations in the autumn of this year to resolve it in a suitable place. The main problems are as follows: 1. Name: Choose one of the original two names or set a new name outside the old name. 2. Location: Choose one of the two general headquarters as the location of the new general headquarters, and the others will be changed to new branch associations. 3. Membership qualifications: All members of the original two associations can be members of the new association. The membership qualifications will be re-established in the new chapter. 4. Articles of association: The committee will be dispatched by the two associations to study and draft the articles of association and submit them to the congress for approval. The proposers will send letters to the two associations requesting and informing all members of the two associations, and respectfully ask them to support with a far-sighted vision and a fair proposition. The proposers are Hu Shuhua, Xia Guangyu, Tang Zaixian, Hua Nangui, Xu Peihuang, Xue Cixin, Ling Hongxun, Wei Yiyu, and Wang Shengshan.</p>

According to the bank's management, the bank is purely commercial in nature and is established for the convenience of the Russian community in Shanghai. All of its staff are Russian and it has no political implications. It officially opened a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Publishes Summary of Municipal Administrative Statistics</h3>
<p>The "Summary of Shanghai Special Municipal Administrative Statistics" published by the Municipal Government is the continuation of the Municipal Statistics Summary published in 1927.

<h3>Baoshan County Sends Personnel to Yangxing Today</h3>
<p>▲ Ordering the Former Administrative Bureau Director to Hand Over</p>
<p>Wu Jianong, the magistrate of Baoshan County, received a strict order from the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province the day before yesterday, stating that since the district offices of the county have been established for half a year, why have the documents and important account books of the Yangxing Township Administrative Bureau not yet been handed over? It is not appropriate and the county magistrate is ordered to investigate quickly, order a clear handover within a specified time, and report without delay. After receiving the order, Magistrate Wu ordered Shen Qing, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, to go to Yangxing today and order Zhang Yahua and Wang Hui, the former directors of the Yangxing Township Administrative Bureau, to hand over the documents clearly within a specified time, without delay, to avoid legal action.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association Relief Report on Yuhuan Spring Relief</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association recently received a report from Yin Junshunzhang, a relief worker in Yuhuan, Zhejiang, stating that Yuhuan County, formerly under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou, is divided into three major districts: Jiangbei, Jiangnan, and Haishan. All are scattered islands, and transportation must be by帆船 or small wheel, and the mountains undulate, and the fall is scattered, and investigation is very difficult. The disaster situation is extremely serious, and the victims only rely on grass head and wheat tips to make soup to fill their hunger, and most of them are starving, without clothes or quilts, and they cannot cover their bodies with brown clothes and worn-out cotton wool. The life of the victims is not as good as that of cattle and horses. The county is isolated in the sea and has no production at all. Last winter, the sea was desolate, and the food relied on Leqing to help. Now Leqing cannot take care of itself, so yam chips can be bought for fourteen catties per 洋祖, and in the spring, 90 catties can be bought per 洋. The value has suddenly increased by more than 60%. The county has always been without wealthy households. Those with two or three hundred acres of land are the richest. The county's money and grain are only more than 10,000 yuan per year, and there is no political expense, schools are suspended, and more than 200 prisoners are short of food and cannot be maintained. The famine happens several times a day, bandits are everywhere, and the people's livelihood is worrying. The people are victims, the officials are victims, and there are about 30,000 households in the county. If strictly checked, 30% is calculated, and there are more than 12,000 households. This time, the amount of relief is only 30,000, and the average calculation is that each household will not receive more than 2 yuan. What is the point? The suffering is immense, and it is difficult to describe in writing. Can the amount of relief be appropriately increased to save the people from their suffering? We are very grateful. Recently, we received a telegram from Feng Ruoyangshan, the director of Zhejiang Relief Affairs, saying that the disaster in Yuhuan is terrible and requesting additional relief funds. The association is now raising funds to provide relief, but the disaster is widespread and the funds are insufficient, and we still need to appeal for help.</p>
<h3>Kawasaki Company Adds Another New Ship</h3>
<p>The Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha is taking advantage of the poor state of the Chinese shipping industry to expand its routes in an attempt to dominate coastal shipping rights. Last month, it added the Lukayama Maru, which runs between Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. Since its opening, business has been very prosperous. Recently, because most of the Chinese merchant ships on the North China route have been suspended, it intends to take this opportunity to develop North China shipping rights and decided to add a new ship, named the Kujirazaki Maru, with a deadweight of 2,350 tons. It sailed into Shanghai yesterday and is anchored in Pudong. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Establishes Municipal Ship Tax Office</h3>
<p>For the convenience of collecting ship taxes in the city, the Municipal Finance Bureau has specially established a Municipal Ship Tax Office to handle all ship tax matters in the city. The bureau has also drafted organizational rules and a budget for the expenses and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval.

<h3>Beixinjing Renamed Pusong Town</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Government, the place names of the districts in this city have gradually become standardized. For example, Meijianong has been changed to Meilong, and Caohejing has been changed to Caojing, all taking the meaning to correspond to the district name and the town name. The Municipal Affairs Committee of Pusong District also submitted a request to change Beixinjing to Pusong Town the day before yesterday. The Municipal Government immediately ordered the Social Bureau to investigate and reply. Now, the Social Bureau has sent personnel to investigate and found that there is Wusong River in the north of the district and Puhuitang in the south. The name of the district is derived from this. The Municipal Affairs Office is located in Beixinjing Town, which is named after the Beixinjing Port, a tributary of the Wusong River. Now, it is proposed to change the town's name to Pusong Town. It is to seek consistency in the names of districts and towns. According to the general rule that place names are often named after a local mountain and river, the town should be named after Pusong rather than the name of a tributary of the Wusong River. It is extensive and appropriate, and it is also for the convenience of official document delivery and connection. It is not impossible to change Beixinjing to Pusong Town. It is heard that the Municipal Government has instructed to approve it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation Solicits Zhejiang Disaster Relief Good Deeds Coupon Gifts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation sent a letter to each factory the day before yesterday, which reads as follows: Dear Sir, We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Commercial Reorganization Committee, which reads as follows: "The Zhejiang Relief Association in Shanghai stated that the disaster situation in Zhejiang Province this year is very serious. Our association plans to follow the example of raising funds for the Shandong disaster and issue good deeds coupons. We will first solicit items to be used as good deeds coupon gifts, and all the proceeds from the sale of the coupons will be used for relief. Since the beginning of the solicitation, charities at home and abroad have actively contributed, and many items have been solicited, but the amount is still far from the estimated amount. Although we have agreed with various national goods groups to organize temporary markets and sub-stations to solicit donations, the relief cause does not distinguish between nationalities. This city is a commercial port with Chinese and foreigners gathering, and all kinds of goods are abundant. Your association leads the commerce and is the general hub of Chinese and foreign countries. We hope that you will give priority to the Zhejiang disaster and give the utmost assistance to our association's solicitation of items. We urge all major stores and businesses to donate as many of the goods they sell or manufacture as possible, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, and regardless of whether they are fine or crude. We hope that there will be as many as possible and that they will continue to come. We know that most of the merchants in Shanghai are deeply aware of the righteousness, and with your association's words, the effect will be as quick as a drum. The disaster victims in the two Zhejiangs will not be slightly benefited. Our association deeply cares about the disaster situation in our hometown, hears the cries of the victims, and is ashamed of not being able to do anything. We hope that you will listen to our request. We are grateful for your kindness." After the committee received the letter, it was decided at the 40th Standing Committee Meeting to ask each industry group to assist in the solicitation and to share the righteousness. We hereby inform you and ask you to pass it on to your members and solicit donations widely to contribute to the righteousness and benefit the victims. We hope that you will investigate.</p>

<h3>Bandit Gao Zhengming Confesses to Robbery</h3>
<p>Dong Mingde, a foreman of the first district of the South City, and detectives Yuan Haishan, Lü Anpu, and Cai Zhiqing, apprehended four bandits, including Wang A'er, on January 19th of this year.

<h3>Shanghai Military Camp Robbery</h3>
<p>The home of Yong native Wang Jiqiu, located at No. 23, Xinxian Lane, behind the former site of the Shanghai Military Camp in the South City, was robbed around 7 o'clock the night before last. Wang happened to be away. After dinner, Wang's father, Jianxiang, and Wang's wife were sitting in the living room. When the maid took a kettle and went out through the back door to fetch water, it is estimated that three bandits, two wearing Changqing-colored long robes and one wearing a blue robe, saw the back door ajar and seized the opportunity to enter. They stepped into the living room, and two bandits drew handguns, threatening them to remain silent. Two bandits guarded the front and back doors, while one bandit went upstairs, broke into the bedroom, rummaged through chests and drawers, and arbitrarily searched and robbed, taking 112 yuan in banknotes and foreign currency stored in the chests, as well as gold, silver, jewelry, and other ornaments, totaling over 400 yuan in value. The bandits then took the loot downstairs, gave a signal, and fled. Afterwards, Wang checked the exact amount of the losses and reported them to the first sub-station of the first district, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3>Interesting Facts About Bicycles</h3>
<p>— Meng Qi</p>
<p>The kind light of the goddess of spring has gradually shone upon people. In the fragrant breeze and warm sunshine, the most interesting outdoor sport is naturally cycling. Thinking about bicycles, I remember many interesting things.</p>
<p>In many places, the authorities do not allow women to ride bicycles. The reason is often that it is harmful to social morals. But when we think about it carefully, riding a bicycle is actually the most appropriate sport for women. However, abuses are naturally inevitable. For example, in the past, prostitutes in Hangzhou often rode bicycles to attract playboys. Therefore, the local authorities had to issue a ban.</p>
<p>A friend told me that a young man who was good at riding a bicycle met a girlfriend through racing. This girlfriend was also good at riding a bicycle. Later, because they shared the same interests, they got married. At the wedding, at the urging of the guests, the newlyweds were asked to compete in a bicycle race. The result was that the bride won. I think the groom must have conceded. Otherwise, this woman would have some real skills.</p>
<p>Generally, the most interesting time is when you first learn to ride a bicycle. For a few days before learning, you think about the bicycle almost day and night. Although you break your skin and bleed, you still can't give up. When you have practiced well, you feel that there is nothing interesting. Otherwise, those green-clad people who deliver red and green envelopes would be too happy. In fact, they are unspeakably miserable.</p>
<p>A small bicycle can have infinite changes. I used to visit the Hamerston Circus. The performing artist's bicycle was really magical. Sometimes he used his hands instead of his feet, sometimes he soared into the air, sometimes he went backwards, sometimes he stood up. The most interesting thing was that it was disassembled into two sections, leaving only one wheel. Yet the person could still move forward as usual. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>I used to love riding a bicycle very much. Once, when I was riding back from my relatives' house, it was already dark. After riding for a while, because the road surface was uneven, I ran straight into the river. At that time, I thought I was doomed. But after I was submerged, I floated up again. I grabbed a handful of grass, trying to climb to the shore. Suddenly, it seemed like someone was pulling me from behind. I was really panicked. I wondered if there were really ghosts. Later, when I turned around and looked, I realized that my long gown was tied to the seat cushion. I couldn't help but laugh. Probably what the world calls ghosts and gods is nothing more than a psychological effect. In the end, my life was saved, but my long gown was torn. Since receiving this lesson, I have been afraid of bicycles whenever I see them. I no longer want to get close to them.</p>

<h3>Talking About Preparing for Air Defense</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xing</p>
<p>China's unification has been achieved, and we must urgently prepare for security. Thinking back to the harm caused by airplanes dropping bombs on the border provinces, which extended for hundreds of miles, resulting in losses of millions, the border defense forces, although using machine guns, mortars, and anti-aircraft guns, etc., to attack fiercely, found it difficult to hit the targets. The reason is that the height and speed of the airplanes are beyond the reach of guns and cannons. Nowadays, various countries are expanding their air forces and producing sophisticated bombs, which will become the most powerful weapons in the world's future air wars. Therefore, Germany plans to build a large copper curtain, 300 yards high, divided into several layers, to place artificial smoke to obscure the sky, so that enemy aircraft will be at a loss. Mr. Jielie Pingsun proposed building cities underground to avoid the tragic end of being crushed to pieces. Various countries have made suggestions, and China, in light of the harm suffered by the border provinces, must also take immediate action. Therefore, it is proposed to create flying arrows, whose height and speed can surpass those of airplanes. When fired fiercely, aerial bullets and fire will erupt like a volcano. Even Germany's latest fighter aircraft will find it difficult to escape. If preparations for defense are not made in advance, the people filling the wilderness will have no survivors. The method of making the arrows will be explained separately. I hope our government will try to create these arrows as a plan to save the country and the people. In this way, the border can be consolidated, and the lives of the people can be secured. (Thanks for the contribution)</p>
<h3>An Unconventional Photo Studio</h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>My old friend Shi Zishipan has set up a photo studio in Anlefang, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road. Although it is called a photo studio, it is actually a residence as well. I have heard of his name for a long time. A few days ago, I accompanied my old mother and brought my two children, Zheng and Ling, to visit him. I saw a small garden in front of the door, planted with several flowers. A young willow tree grew tall beyond the fence, its tender green branches bending as if to greet guests. The room was furnished with several tables and chairs, all in the latest modern style, simple and elegant. I heard that they were all designed by Mr. Jiang Xiaohu. The walls were decorated with various photos, mostly portraits, with the light being just right, unlike ordinary studios. These are all Shi Zizipan's masterpieces. Going upstairs, I saw the photo studio. The windows were covered with velvet curtains, and several lighting lamps were arranged around the room, all covered with white silk, providing clear but not dazzling light. The background was made of thick brown flannel, with hardly any creases. In the middle was a huge camera, with a German-made lens worth hundreds of gold, a rare item. Further in, a velvet curtain touched the ground, marking a makeup room. The dressing table was also new-style, exquisite and lovely, accompanied by gorgeous lamps and silk ornaments, as well as a nude beauty incense burner, all exquisitely beautiful, making people reluctant to leave. After touring around, Shi Zizipan took a photo of my old mother, then one of me and my two children, Zheng and Ling, guiding and directing the lighting meticulously. The next day, he showed me the film. The expressions were natural and lifelike. Shi Zizipan's artistic skill is evident. I admired it repeatedly and couldn't help but praise him.</p>

<h3>New Words on the Carpet</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom House Master</p>
<p>A month ago, various newspapers in this city widely reported that Cheng Yanqiu would withdraw from his singing and dancing career. The Jingang Pictorial even published a report that Yanqiu had already grown a beard. Recently, friends returning from the north mentioned that Yanqiu did indeed have a lukewarm attitude two or three months ago. However, after the persuasion of various bigwigs in the industry, he soon abandoned his preconceived notions and showed signs of taking the opportunity to form a troupe. Around that time, the Tianjin Xinxin Grand Theater sent someone to invite him. After repeated negotiations between the two parties, with the conditions not far apart, Yanqiu readily agreed. The rumors circulating for months that Yanqiu had stopped singing and changed careers were thus proven to be inaccurate. However, most of his original troupe members had already dispersed. People like Guan Dayuan, Hou Xirui, and Wang Youji had already joined other performers. It was impossible to gather them together for a while, so Yanqiu changed the roles of Guan and Wang, inviting Yan Jupeng and Jiang Miaoxiang to fill them, and also invited Hao Shouchun to help out temporarily to fill the gap left by Hou Xirui. The new troupe's cast is more complete than before. This time, Yanqiu led a large group of people to Tianjin to perform. It can be predicted that he will return with a good reputation.</p>
<p>Ms. Hua Huilin, famous in Shanghai, was taught her art by Little Zihe and Li Qinxian. Her style is proper and generous, combining the best of both. Last year, she went to Tianjin with her teacher to join a troupe. Her new voice was first tried, and she was praised throughout Tianjin. Newspapers and public opinion were particularly favorable. Now that the contract has expired, she returned to Shanghai by Shuntian wheel a few days ago. Teachers Feng and Li also returned to the south together.</p>
<p>Kun Ling Du Liyun's art has progressed rapidly since she worshiped Wang Yiyaoqing as her teacher, and her reputation has also been rising steadily. A month ago, she performed at the Huale Tea Garden in Xianyukou, and her beauty and reputation spread widely, rivaling Zhang Eyun and Jin Youqin. Starting this month, she will switch to performing at the Kaiming Cinema. Her future is bright and unlimited.</p>
<p>Hu Fangting, the manager of the Lida Stage in Hankou, came to Shanghai to invite Kun Ling Pan Xueyan, and the negotiations are about to be completed. At that time, rumors arose, and people were panicked. Xueyan was afraid that the situation in Hankou was unstable and that it would affect ticket sales. Therefore, she politely declined the trip to Hankou. It is rumored that Xueyan asked for too high a price and stopped the trip west, but this does not seem to be the real reason.</p>
<p>Xu Biyun, Gao Qingkui, and others will return north by boat soon.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng, Guan Dayuan, and others will complete their term on the 24th and will not continue. They will return to Ping together at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from European Travels (46)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲Andre Derain (2)</p>
<p>(Menglang's Work)</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about Derain. Derain's paintings have extraordinary authority and power in the modern European art world. In the Chinese art world, which is still too immature in its knowledge of new art, perhaps few people know this name.</p>
<p>During the heyday of Fauvism, Derain and Vaminck were called the two geniuses of the suburbs of Paris, probably by Maurice Denis. At that time, they both lived in Chatou. This seemed like an inseparable pair of lovebirds. Although youth combined the strong temperaments of the two, they had little in common spiritually. In fact, the distance between Derain and Vaminck is the distance between an artist with great ideals and an instinctive artisan of great talent. Moreover, when Denis spoke of Fauvism, he always listed the former as belonging to the famous [Geometric School], while he hardly mentioned the latter. Originally, the latter, like the former, came from art school. However, Derain had already demonstrated his profound cultivation on his first canvas. As for Vaminck's paintings, they were just the ordinary things seen by ordinary people. A kind of folk characteristic was very obvious. It has always been undeniable. Derain specialized in using the contrast of [surfaces] to make the picture appear subjective. In this respect alone, he stood parallel to Matisse. However, the great tradition of painting was closer to him than to the others. Derain's works, because of their various interests, contained many rare complexities. On the simple appearance, Derain was always an amazing writer.</p>
<p>If Matisse created a style of painting that was completed by a decorator, then Derain was the first person to be liberated from the entanglements of decoration. He skillfully expressed what he had practiced in Fauvism at that time, and sought out exposed tones. He once followed in the footsteps of Cezanne and discovered miracles that people had never noticed. He integrated all the techniques of this master of Aix, and then spied on the most mysterious places in art history. From then on, people constantly discussed his close relationship with the difficult reasoning and ancient meanings. Some said that it was a chaotic talent, wanting to melt the classical tradition and the primitive naivety into one furnace. It was a complex intellect, a kind of modulated intellectualism. He mixed the refined aesthetic concepts of the decadent artists of the late nineteenth century into the ancients' love of beauty. Primitive art sometimes used its symmetrical patterns to hypnotize him. He then gave it a certain charm. When he explored carefully, he gained a particularly humane way in the art of his peers. A method of communication that was clearer than a more foreign model. He was only influenced by the inherent decorative structure of some foreign models. He preferred to recreate the atmosphere of ancient sculptures and medieval gold-leaf paintings. Because he had a penchant for antiquity, he was fond of pure forms. For the spiritualistic art of the past, he was always fascinated. When he painted portraits, he brought a sweet harmony and a careful rhythm, sometimes with the smile of a primitive man. Like a bee, he sucked the flowers in the mysterious garden. Cimabue, Giotto, Fouguet, as well as the Mosaic writers and tapestry makers all gave this spiritual connoisseur pleasure. He retained in his heart a memorial of endless interest. It was not that the pictures created by his hands sometimes emitted a strange fragrance. It was that people understood the deep taste of modernism. In the deep harmony of his colors and the enthusiastic arrangement of his composition, he had foreseen the spirit of Gothic culture. The so-called Gothic style in his works was completed at the same time as the Great War. The spirit of primitivism on his canvases was also confirmed from then on.</p>

It is also reported that silk cocoon firms and various brands that collect cocoons have not been willing to throw out forward foreign exchange this year due to the financial industry's situation, and they estimate that the market will not rise at that time, so they have not made any transactions and are waiting for the right time. However, it is reported that banks have previously boldly deposited foreign accounts and stored cash for future use. It is unknown whether this is for silk cocoon needs. According to observations by people in the industry, most of it is for cocoon funds.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Extremely Declining</h3>
<p>Although Overseas Cotton Yarn Rose, the Local Market Was Extremely Weak; The situation was chaotic and the base stock was thick, with sales not smooth. The season was about to end, and rural farmers were busy, and the need was bound to decrease, so most people were pessimistic. Retail investors dumped more and more, and the decline in the price of futures yarn was particularly fierce. Because the seller delivered a large batch of spot goods, the buyer saw that the situation was not good and gave up the amount, with no intention to receive the goods.</p>
<p>▲ Many People in the Benchmark Market Aggressively Exit Long Positions; The Benchmark Market opened in the morning, and the market atmosphere was still firm due to the rise in American cotton and retail investors going short. Later, as long positions exited in two or three sessions, the market declined. However, the January price was firmer, resulting in a near-term decline of 1 tael 5 qian to 8 qian and 9 qian and a far-term rise of 1 qian. It was reported in the afternoon that the demand for spot yarn was weak, and long positions were still closed. The trading floor was quite loose. 1,100 bales were sold in both the early and late markets around number 50. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 2, 4, and 5 qian. The total number of transactions for the day was 17,250 bales. The closing price of the Benchmark Market is recorded on the left:</p>

<h3>Limited Progress in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of American cotton telegrams was quite strong. In the local cotton market, there was still a lack of sellers, and the attitude of the Han merchants was still firm. However, some profit-takers took the opportunity to close out, so the market showed a slightly loose appearance. Spot cotton on the market was still not being sold in large quantities by various factories, because the previously ordered Indian cotton was quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲ Futures Cotton Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon; The Benchmark Market opened in the morning, and the situation was very tight due to the rise in American cotton and many retail investors going short. However, those who had profited in the near term closed out, rising only 5 fen in the near term and 1 qian and a half in the far term. The market atmosphere was slightly weak in the afternoon. The current month fell by 1 qian and 5 fen, and the far month fell by 5 fen. However, 40 to 50 dan arrived on the 18th. The total number of transactions for the day was 44,700 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Short Sellers Heavily Covered Last Week</h3>
<p>A telegram from New York dated the 21st reports on the cotton market during the week, stating that the situation in the Cotton Exchange last week was entirely short covering. The May price was particularly active at 1.04 yuan, until the May price reached 1.0564 yuan on Thursday. It is believed that this buying trend was driven by fellow traders covering, as well as short covering and position adjustments by traders both domestically and internationally, the amount of which was not small. Subsequently, the stagnation of transactions led to a slight reaction. Some short sellers were still strong in their attitude, but most had already covered. However, it seemed that the stagnation of transactions would depend on the development of the new cotton market or a good indication of the purpose of the May longs.</p>
<p>The telegram also reported that there was a risk of a short squeeze for the May and July contracts. The government seemed to be paying special attention to the cotton market. Most merchants and factories were covering, and domestic sales were still sluggish. Domestic grey cloth transactions were still weak, and the market atmosphere showed signs of slight improvement. American cotton weekend statistics are attached on the left (unit: thousand bales).</p>

After repeated increases, the Changbang Northern rice stabilized, but the market situation was not easy to loosen. Green goods customers also sold off. Nanyang thin rice arrived and sold at par, with no price fluctuations. Transactions of Yangxian decreased, and Du jian customers were not active. Butian retail sales were quiet, mostly due to the impact of high prices. Importers had no intention of buying smoothly. The arrival of Baiyuan goods was increasingly rare, and the buying interest was not as strong as the previous day. The market price was slightly firm.</p>
<p>▲ South Shanghai; Very few goods arrived downriver, totaling less than ten ships. Market sales were uneven. Prices of each group's machine-milled japonica rice were high, superior grades were stable, and particularly top-grade japonica rice was between 19.45 yuan. The appetite of country villages was slightly stagnant, and only stores were slightly active. Customers for thin rice such as Sijing and Xitang, and early rice such as Tinglin in the South Road, lacked appetite. However, ordinary goods were very active. High-priced goods were 17.5 yuan, and large boats rarely prospered or suffered. The appetite for Yang Du jian in this area was still good because the goods were extremely scarce. The price of Bianyin and other Yuan rice increased in response to news from Xiang Road, leading to a tight market in Shanghai, and the number of shi sold was quite high.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Back in Circulation is Hoarding</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of foreign rice continued to rise. Because the foreign firms had no intention of selling, and there was even talk of settling a portion of the price, the market became even better, and goods back in circulation were hoarded. Prices of distant contracts rose by 3 to 4 fen each, and near-term contracts rose by 1 to 2 fen to nearly 1 jiao each. However, the street's sales were slightly weak after two new ships arrived with spot goods. Only customers from the interior and Wenzhou were still very active. As the street's appetite was dull, confidence returned to normal. A total of 1,000 bags of spot goods of Saigon number one sold for 15 yuan, 2,000 bags of small-grain rice sold for 14.5 yuan, and 3,000 bags of large-grain rice sold for 13.9 yuan. Secondary grades were priced lower. Futures rice included 1,000 tons of Saigon rice, 1,600 tons of small-grain rice, over 1,000 tons of large-grain rice, and 150 tons of Min Dang rice, all sold after being returned to circulation.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Speculation Benefits the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, prices in the flour market were generally firm and rising. In March, April, and May, the market began to revert back to normal. Factory inventories were generally less than a month's worth, and prices were rising because, if the demand and sales of flour are relatively high during the shoulder months, there may be problems with supply and demand. Additionally, prices for key rice blends in both local and foreign ports are rising due to low inventories, and these conditions appear to be helping the flour market rise. Considering March and April contracts are no longer trading at a discount, the key to the future should be thought of in terms of actual conditions. New flour for distant months is trading at a higher premium because factories are not selling and customer sentiment is still good. As a result, the contract for this month and the April contract are trading one point higher than the previous day, the May contract is trading 1.25 points higher, the June contract is trading 2.5 points higher, the July contract is trading 5 points higher, and the August contract is trading 7.5 points higher.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Short Sellers Heavily Covered Last Week</h3>
<h3>Differing Prices of Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a mixed picture of rising and falling prices for various months. The current month started steady, but then bulls slightly reduced their positions. Shorts were preparing for physical delivery, causing the market sentiment to turn flat. For distant months, quotes for foreign wheat were up two to three cents for Chicago No. 2 and around seven cents for Canadian wheat, which greatly stabilized confidence. It's predicted that if shorts are indeed prepared for delivery this month, there shouldn't be any problems. As for new wheat futures, barring major weather events, the market value might have to be lowered a bit in the future. The result was a decrease of one cent for the current month compared to the previous day, an increase of one cent for April, one cent for June, no change for July, and one cent for August. The spot market was very quiet yesterday, as all high-quality goods were prepared for delivery. Lower-quality goods were not desired by factories. Only 400 bags of Nan Suizhou wheat were traded at 5 taels, 1 mace, and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybeans Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean futures soared as a telegram from Dalian reported an increase of a substantial margin. Current futures opened around 7 taels and 1 mace, causing local merchants to be uniformly bullish. Standard current futures rose by 7 fen, and distant futures increased by nearly 1 mace. High-quality current Dalian soybeans are trending strongly above 4 taels and 5 mace.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Sales Stagnant, Prices Softening</h3>
<p>The piece goods market remained mostly down yesterday, with Eastern goods such as tiaozifu silk, blue tiaoding, and printed cloth showing weakness. This was mainly due to numerous rumors and uncertain public sentiment. Traffic for merchants was especially slow due to Saturday. However, about 200 pieces of fine bibby, zhigongduan satin, and wenmingding were traded on this street. Among these goods, only First Grade zhigongduan had limited inventory and rose by 2.5 li, selling for 2 qian, 4 fen, and 7.5 li yesterday. Shuangtonglu zhigongni remained steady at 2 qian, 3 fen, and 2.5 li. Wenmingding, which had been firm for a long time, fell by 2.5 li, with Da Deli opening at 1 qian, 8 fen, and 2.5 li, and Meilanfang and Western Beauty both at 1 qian, 8 fen. The price of blue tiaoding remained level. Spot prices for fine bibby, Baoqiu assorted colors, and bald blue-gray fell again to 25 pieces, opening at 2 qian, 6 fen, and 2.5 li. White heavy French velvet has been in demand on this street recently, with Damo Lion selling for 2 qian, 3 fen and Fuhua for 2 qian, 2 fen and 5 li, mainly used for lining robes. Since the changing situation, Western goods sales in the north have been severely impacted. Those who intended to restock are now hesitant, especially for jacquard western yarn and tiaoziyusha. White chongtiao linen yarn has already fallen below 2 qian.</p>

<h3>The Life of Native People in Southeast Asia - Jasmine</h3>
<p>(3) Rules for Being a Husband</p>
<p>On the day of the wedding, the man must prepare another cow to show his goodwill. At the same time, this cow can be killed and used as a delicious feast for the guests. As a rule, before the wedding, the man has to go through a very long set of rituals. The native people especially consider the cow on the wedding day to be important. If he does not kill a cow to feed the guests on this day, no matter if he has had physical relations with this woman or has already raised children, others can still offer a higher price to buy his wife away. The Zulu people do not have a specific limit on the number of wives they can have. If he has cattle and can pay, he can marry as many as he likes. However, there is a rule for being a husband: he can marry many wives, but they must be treated equally. He is not allowed to love one and dislike another, and he must love them all fairly and universally, not love you more and love her less.</p>
<p>(4) Wives and Thatched Huts</p>
<p>When a man marries, he must live apart from his parents. However, the construction of a new house is still decided by his parents or elders. There are about three considerations regarding the location of the house: first, it cannot be too far from the hunting forest; second, there must be a clean piece of land near the new house where corn can be planted; and third, it must be within a few dozen steps of a pool where one can bathe forever. If such a location cannot be found, then a slightly worse location will do, as long as the raw materials for making native beer can be planted nearby. Their new house is really a thatched hut, with only a small door that lets in light. When entering the thatched hut, one must kneel and crawl in. Although this thatched hut is extremely simple, the mud floor inside is polished very clean.</p>
<p>Because a wife must have her own unique thatched hut, the more wives one marries, the more thatched huts there are. If their children grow up, their sleeping quarters must of course be separate. Therefore, prosperous native people have nearly twenty to forty thatched huts. We can also infer the number of wives a person has from the number of thatched huts. If he is a strong man, their thatched hut life is not lonely. He either goes hunting, sets traps to catch wild deer, digs rabbit holes, skins animals, or makes beer. Women, on the other hand, sometimes chop firewood, sometimes fetch water, sometimes cultivate the fields, and sometimes cook. The most regular task is to scrub the mud floor every fourteen days.</p>
<p>Children also have duties to fulfill in the family, which is to help their mothers chop firewood and fetch water. In addition, they go to the fields to watch out for monkeys and crows eating the food. When they grow up, their duties are the same as their father's. Girls, at the age of seven or eight, do household work. Boys at this age are responsible for herding cattle and sheep.</p>
<p>(5) A Wild Booze-Drinking Festival</p>
<p>Although the uncouth native people are now gradually assimilating with us, their ancient rituals are still prevalent. The most obvious is the booze-drinking of native beer. We have a servant named Nandi, who is also a native. He often goes to participate in this grand event in the evening. For those of us who do not know their lives, we often feel a strange interest in our hearts. We once asked him if we could participate and if we could photograph their wild revelry. They seemed to find our request interesting, so they readily agreed. We also promised to repay them with two wild animals. So the next day, we packed up our photography equipment and went together to the designated village. When we arrived, there was no sign of welcome at all. There wasn't even a dog in front of the door. We hesitated for a while, and suddenly felt panic in our hearts. What we feared was that the native people would object to our photography, so they had all avoided us before we arrived. After waiting for about half an hour, a beautifully dressed man came out of the haystack. He didn't seem to see us and walked straight into the thatched hut. We sat for a while and then secretly went to the front of the thatched hut to peek inside. We were startled to see a crowd of people packed inside, men, women, old, and young.</p>
<p>Their guests came in increasing numbers. Some of them recognized us and raised their hands to welcome us. By noon, they all came out of the thatched hut. At this time, a deer that we had brought was placed in front of them. None of them touched it until the second game arrived, and then they all skinned the animals together. They were very skilled at cooking. The water had already been fetched, and the firewood had been placed under the large iron pot. Inside the iron pot was twenty gallons of thick, milky white native beer. On top of the pot were dozens of bowls, each containing about a gallon of beer. When the game was almost cooked, everyone sat around the large pot. Several women took turns pouring the beer. They did not drink together by raising their glasses because there were too many people and not enough bowls to go around. Instead, one person would finish drinking and then hand the bowl to the person sitting next to them. The strangest thing was that they didn't say a word while drinking. Everyone was silent, especially at the beginning, and they observed solemn etiquette with each other. No one remained sober during this wild drinking. Once drunk, they had no restraints at all. Some laughed and joked, and some shouted, as if they had changed personalities. When we first saw their expressions, we didn't know what pleasure they had, but now we suddenly understood. After getting drunk, the circle they were sitting in also began to break. At this time, their women often stood up and danced. Her way of dancing was very different from ours in the West. When she was tired of dancing, another person would continue to dance. It is said that every woman has a different way of dancing, and each one is meant to express an emotion or an unrealized hope.</p>
<p>(6) The Dance of Gratitude</p>
<p>My wife and I sat on the side, watching their strange forms, and couldn't help but think of the terrible things that the preacher had told us when he returned from Africa. We were of different races and spoke different languages, so we could only sit and watch. When the women finished dancing, the men stood up again, preparing to dance the dance of gratitude together. They stood there, watching the oldest person dance first. The oldest person seemed to be the most respected person in their village. He danced to thank the sunlight for giving them light and warmth, and to thank the outsiders for participating in their festival with kindness. His dancing was not very long. After he finished dancing, he took the lead and guided everyone to sing together. At this time, the effects of the alcohol were very strong, and everyone sang and danced even more wildly because we were recording them. Unfortunately, it was getting dark and we couldn't take pictures. We left their dancing ground when the sun went down. My wife still laughs when she thinks about their wild revelry.</p>
<h3>Dr. Japanese New Research on Having Boys and Girls</h3>
<p>▲ Can the eternal mystery be further resolved?</p>
<p>The Japanese Medical Association will hold its eighth congress in Osaka in April. Professor Kawaka, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology, will explain the cause of the eternal mystery of having boys and girls. For two years, the professor used two to three thousand house mice to conduct detailed animal experiments based on the composition of food, drug injections, and other stimulating methods and conditions. Gradually, further solutions were obtained. It is said that [although hundreds of hypotheses have been proposed and thousands of experiments have been conducted to explain this eternal mystery, the iron gate is still not easy to open. The most powerful hypothesis, which is recognized by many people, is the explanation based on sex chromosomes, but it is difficult to explain all organisms with this]. Therefore, the professor put forward a unique hypothesis, saying that the conditions for sex determination are that the reproductive cells of both sexes generally have two groups that determine masculinity and femininity. The sex is also determined to be male or female depending on which side has more of the necessary elements. When the two groups for sex determination have equal strength, it will be determined by the influence of other third conditions. Based on this hypothesis, the experiments conducted by the professor can be divided into four types, such as giving food with various vitamins, a large amount of protein, and a large amount of salt, injecting secretions from endocrine glands, injecting Japanese food nerve poisons, and examining the effects of Reutgen rays. The test results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When females are given vitamin A and vitamin D and mated with ordinary males, they are more likely to produce male offspring.</p>
<p>(2) Giving females Clistanlin also results in more male offspring.</p>
<p>(3) When females are given ovarian secretions such as Ziskunengen and Aggeonengen, they are more likely to produce female offspring.</p>
<p>(4) When nerve poison is injected into both males and females, more male offspring are produced.</p>
<p>(5) When a white, toxic organic base is injected into a female, more female offspring are produced. When injected into a male, more male offspring are produced. When injected into both, the resulting offspring are half male and half female.</p>
<p>(6) When an organic base is given to a male and nerve poison is given to a female, more male offspring are produced.</p>
<p>(7) When nerve poison is given to a male and an organic base is given to a female, more female offspring are produced.</p>
<p>(8) When 4/9 of the male's skin has red spots, irradiation with Lian Gen rays shows a significantly higher chance of producing male offspring.</p>
<p>Regarding the above items, the professor said that the vitamin preparations and ovarian preparations are the two items that can be applied to people in this study. Other applications will be dangerous until future research is done.</p>
<h3>Liang Quanwan on British Shipbuilding Industry</h3>
<p>In recent years, the British shipbuilding industry has been struggling and striving desperately, just like other industries. The cruel and terrifying European War temporarily increased the demand for ships, but after the European War, this demand gradually decreased. Now, it is different again. In the past year or two, the British shipbuilding industry has made amazing progress, which is a remarkable achievement. In 1929, the total number of ships built in Britain reached 1,525,000 tons, an increase of 28,000 tons compared to the tonnage of ships built in 1928. To be honest, such a large tonnage is unprecedented in Britain. Last year, the total tonnage of ships built in Britain was 273,000 tons more than the total tonnage of ships built worldwide in 1929, which is a truly alarming amount.</p>
<p>Today, the demand for oil tankers is an undeniable fact, because they are easy to drive and the engine does not take up much space. There are currently 85 oil tankers being built worldwide, totaling 627,000 tons, 73 of which are powered by motor engines. However, Britain accounts for 54 of them, totaling 398,000 tons, which are currently under construction. Therefore, when calculated in detail, the total amount of oil tankers in Britain accounts for 63% of the world's oil tankers.</p>
<p>Ford's Autobiography</p>
<p>Henry Ford's "My Life and Work" has now been adopted as a teaching material for management courses by a certain American university. He is currently working on another book that teaches people how to make money. After this book is published, everyone can hope to become a millionaire. (Miaowu)</p>
<p>Results of the British Library Association Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The results of the British Library Association's annual meeting last year were very good. The most important issues discussed at the meeting were the cooperative compilation of library catalogs, children's reading materials, and the connection between small cities and rural town library organizations. The conference also signed a contract with the Bookstore Association, in which bookstores will still give special discounts for public libraries to purchase books. (Miaowu)</p>
