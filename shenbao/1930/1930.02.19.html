<p>時評</p>
<h3>法内閣辭職</h3>
<p>法首相泰狄歐氏。正在軍縮會議緊要之時。而忽假歸。歸而病。病稍愈。而忽又提出閣總辭表。論者必疑其有重大關係。然其實不僅與軍縮問題無關係。影響至多停頓三數日之接洽而止。即在法國内政方面。亦不生若何重大之影響也。</p>
<p>何以故。以法國倒閣組閣。爲一極尋常之事。法於歐戰後。無一長時期之内閣如班樂衛白乃安赫里歐等。皆辭而復組。組而復辭者。不知若干次。其原因自歐戰以後。財政不易整理。預算不易解决。爲財政總長者。常處於辛苦困難之境。稍顧政府收入。則起人民責言。稍顧人民負担。則招政府不满。故偶有一問題起。議會中即生爭執。龐雜紛呶。交相指摘。結果非氣憤而去。即抨撃而辭内閣不能不隨之以倒。戰後法内閣改組之頻繁。更換財政之忙碌。原因皆在乎是。而此次泰狄歐内閣辭職。亦即爲預算問題。要點僅在易一財長而已法内閣之易倒。除財政外。更因政黨内部之分歧。旣無堅固鮮明之大組織。各小黨又離合無常。化分莫定。政黨之結合不鞏固。即内閣自身之基礎不鞏固當然易於摇動。再以政府方面論。法國之法律。大總統雖亦有解散議會之權然自一八七七年一度試行之後。鑒於糾紛困難之多。雖有時政府與議會。意見不相容。而政府寗願退讓。不願主張解散。故解散之事。從未實現。由是議會之權日重。相爭結果。惟有内閣辭職之一法。此亦爲易倒之一原因。然内閣雖頻倒。而繼起組閣者。仍不外此政局中之數要人。故於政局不生若何影響。今日巴黎電謂。倒閣政潮。倐然而來。左翼諸黨。决計與政府爲難。亦僅揣度之詞耳。</p>

<h3>法内閣總辭職</h3>
<p>泰狄歐將重起組閣</p>
<p>不致影響海軍政策</p>
<p>路透社十七日巴黎電　預算案中社會保險案所載關於小商店主婦所得稅之估計一條、今日衆議院以二八六票對二八一票否决之、政府失敗、政府曾以此事爲信任問題、故已辭職、衆議院已無期休會　　路透社十七日巴黎電　衆議院投票不利於政府、政府旣以此爲信任問題、除辭職外、别無他法、閣員於此案失敗後、即行集議、决定往晤因病在床之泰狄歐總理、閣員二人趨至榻旁、助總理草擬辭職書、其餘閣員候於外室、未幾、全體閣員除泰狄歐臥病及海軍部長萊巨留英外、齊入總統府呈遞辭職書、又電、法總統已接受内閣辭職書、</p>
<p>路透社十八日巴黎電　泰狄歐倒閣之政潮、倐然而來、惟左翼諸黨决計與政府爲難、故此政潮並非全出意外、泰狄歐去年十月於白里安辭總理職後、組織内閣、今年先努力於海牙、繼折衝於倫敦、盡職積勞、以致染病、近來往來於倫敦巴黎之間、蓋不得不暫返巴黎、親自辦理内政也　　路透社十七日倫敦電　據倫敦法代表團所表示之意見、法政府之失敗、不致使代表團受其影響、大約法總統將請泰狄歐重組内閣、而將財政部長易人、</p>
<p>路透社十八日巴黎電　法衆議院在倫敦海會正處中流之際、推倒政府、法國各報均有不满之詞、而以此與英下院自重爲較、今左翼各報雖要求組織新政府、但左翼各黨一致主張泰狄歐回任、咸以爲欲敗英國在海會束縛法國手腕之策略、非泰氏莫屬云、</p>
<h3>主艦比率問題</h3>
<p>日本全權對美努力折衝</p>
<p>結果雙方意見仍未接近</p>
<p>電通社十七日倫敦電　十七日在聖哲木斯宫開會之日英美三國會議、其結果如何、各國均守秘密、綜合各方面之消息觀之、若槻全權之態度、非常强硬、反駁美國之六成說、不遺餘力、謂日本所以要求七成始满足者、係完全忠實於凱洛格條約、非對於任何一國與以威脅、至美國之六成主張、係使日本感受威脅、實有違反非戰條約之旨云、會議時間所以延長者、因日美兩國、對此交換强硬之意見、結果六成七成之主張、依然毫未接近、遂散會、</p>
<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　英美日三國總代表集議日本對主力艦之比率、此爲今日與海會有關之最重要會議、據負責方面云、大會刻正深切研究數字問題、設有一國提出大而切實之數字、則比率則受影響、故一時不能有大進步之望、但表面雖似遲緩、而幕後現已着手許多工作、目前各國尚未有修正其要求者、今日英代表團之發言人稱、締結地中海洛迦諾條約之問題、會場中未正式提出、此種政治問題、須有地中海沿岸各國之出席、再此次海會亦與德國程度無關、蓋德國程序乃軍縮籌備會所應辦之事也云、路透社探悉外傳二月十四日英法美海軍代表集議、發生齟齬、美代表史汀生怫然退席之說、全無根據、當日三國代表之討論、固甚和平也、今日專家考慮特别艦問題、尤注意於特别艦應如何補換一層、但議無結果、英國負責方面切實否認已向德國接洽「袖珍戰艦」事之說、（所謂袖珍戰艦者、乃世人加於德國所造新式軍艦之名、）報界探悉二月十二日法總理泰狄歐所提出之數字、法國迄未允减少、此事頗棘手、進行因以阻滯、而他國且將不得已重行考慮全局矣、例如英國之允將巡艦减至五十艘、係以其所預料的結果爲根據、雖英國現未必增高其數字、但定將對於全局再加以愼重考慮也、倫敦某報有指法國備忘錄、爲海會前途之大打撃者、法國報紙因此有不满意之批評、故今日英政府方面發言人向外人記者聲明、英政府絕未與任何英報紙或通信社有何關係　　日聯社十八日東京電　此間有力新聞報館代表、組織軍縮會議特派記者團、其目的在於以日本國民之名義、激勵出席倫敦會議之日本全權團、該記者團一行、昨日起程赴英、該團到英之後、除激勵日本全權之外、歷訪各國全權、披瀝日本對軍縮之熱意及希望、並努力請求各方面諒解、該團一行又於往來日英之途、游歷列國、視察私辦造船廠、以資將來軍縮問題之參考、</p>
<h3>日本總選明日期满</h3>
<p>開票廿三日全部告竣</p>
<p>臨時議會四月中召集</p>
<p>濱口遊說歸來力竭聲嘶</p>
<p>無産各派相互成立默契</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電　從關西地方遊說於昨晨歸京之濱口首相、因在各處演說過多、喉爲之腫、發聲極難、頃以其啞音、語遊說所感於記者曰、予所見聞者、僅關西地方及東海道之一部、民政黨在此等地方之人氣、眞是可觀、每次演說會、均告满員、甚有立於屋外者、予喉即因此腫痛、選舉結果、非至最後揭曉、不能知悉、然以予所見、民政黨若照此趨勢、二百四十名以上、可以絕對保證、但亦未可過作樂觀、競爭正達最高潮期、我等亦有傾注全力、繼續奮鬥之覺悟、各地因選舉戰白熱化、違反事件陸續發生、此殊可爲政界惜者、惟違反者之數、表面上民政黨雖較政友會爲多、蓋因琦玉縣立候補者某氏及其運動員四十名、均被檢舉、故實際之件數、民政黨較少、總之、此後僅餘三日、各派必用所有手段以取勝、政府决嚴重取締政友會之監視員月曜會員摘發與黨候補之違反事實、宣言取締不公、以予所見、地方警察均持嚴正公平之態度、開票二十三日全部告竣、臨時議會大約在四月中旬召集、總之此次爲乾坤一擲之大决戰、爲獲得二百四十名之故、僅傷予喉、亦殊值得、將更鼓满身之勇、繼續奮鬥、不得最後勝利不止云、</p>
<p>電通十八日東京電　表面相持不讓之無産各派、因選舉戰之進展、相互成立暗默之妥協、對於無自黨候補者之區、務必投票於他之無産候補者、將來開票結果、無産黨議員必比前次增加、至爲明瞭、舌戰之大山郁夫、亦以口舌之力、漸能感動大衆、京都之河上肇博士形勢亦漸有利、</p>
<h3>蘇俄五年實業計畫</h3>
<p>替代列寗新經濟政策</p>
<p>已由中執會通過</p>
<p>路透社十八日倫敦電　莫斯科消息、蘇俄中央執行委員會通過一案、實行史丹林五年實業計畫、以代列寗新經濟政策、依此議案、凡在已成立公有制度區之富農、必須逐出、而其産業必須没收、何人應逐、何人應留、當地蘇維埃黨部得决定之、但留者須住於公有農區之外、應逐者將遣往勞工稀少或無居人之區、凡在尚未成立公有制度區域内之農民、一概不准將其産業出售、或捐助、或轉租、或分給、違者充公、</p>
<h3>英國將有新政黨出現</h3>
<p>名統一帝國黨</p>
<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　著名報館主人庇佛白羅克爵士、向主張帝國内自由貿易政策者、現發表宣言、謂組織新政黨、名曰統一帝國黨、已有男女發起人二十萬人云、</p>
<h3>德防務總長要求造艦費被拒絕</h3>
<p>路透社十八日柏林電　德内閣集議至今日侵晨始散、防務總長要求在預算案内列明建造與「袖珍戰艦」相同之第二萬噸巡洋艦經費、卒爲多數閣員拒絕、</p>
<h3>英相脫離獨立工黨</h3>
<p>因嫌其傾左故</p>
<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　英相麥唐納已與獨立工黨脫離關係、蓋因該黨中多左翼份子、其對於工黨政府之叛離態度、日見增甚也、今日聞該黨南部黨員、星期杪集會於倫敦、通過一議案、向梅克斯頓等致賀、因其反對政府失業保險案也、</p>
<h3>日賣勳案藤田謙一再度下獄</h3>
<p>日聯十八日東京電　曾關於賣勳賄案起訴保釋中之東京商工會議所總理藤田謙一、十七日上午接東京地方裁判廳召喚命令、至下午九時以證據消滅罪、再被收容於市谷刑務所、</p>
<h3>白俄將軍失蹤案</h3>
<p>不日將有驚人發展</p>
<p>路透社十七日巴黎電　今日聞法警察已查知三星期前綁去俄人古悌博夫將軍者、實爲蘇俄密探、大約此後四十八小時内、或有驚人發展、聞總理泰狄歐曾表示意思、如衆議院欲與俄國絕交、則渠準備斷絕對俄外交關係、據法警察之推測、古悌博夫將軍被二人及一喬裝警察曳入汽車後、即被載往諾曼地、而轉送至在浮蘇麥港外行蹤詭密懸掛俄旗之船上、如此說果確、則古將軍現已無生望矣、</p>

<p>美聯社十七日紐約電　梅蘭芳自在華盛頓一露色相後、昨晚又在紐約登台、紐約之評劇家及報館記者全數列席、雖言語隔閡、而觀衆則異常满意、極口頌揚、梅氏在此首先所演者、均屬短趣劇、佈景服裝、全由中國帶來、聞此後將試演長劇公電</p>
<p>蘇省黨整委會電　各報館轉全國黨政軍各機關均鑒、近閱報載、受命中央誓詞未乾之陸海空軍副司令閻錫山忽致我革命領袖蔣中正同志元電、有以禮讓爲懷、相約下野等語、披閱之餘、至深驚詫、慨本黨自蔣中正同志率師完成北伐以來、訓政開始、編遣實施、國家統一於以告成、民族獨立行將實現、海内同胞莫不額手稱慶、不幸自去春以來、軍閥餘孽、黨内叛徒、相互勾結、變亂迭起、又幸我蔣中正同志受黨國之重命、奮大無畏之精神、次第敉平、然值兹反動勢力尚未完全肅清、主義尚未實現、正賴我蔣中正同志領導全倫、繼續奮鬥、完成先總理之遺志、躋中國於自由平等之域、詎受中央重命之閣氏誤認權責、淆亂聽聞、其勸蔣同志個人之下野、不啻使革命大業完全墜落、致中華民族陷於萬刦不復之地、循誦蔣同志對記者之談話、對革命之意義、權責之分晰、剴切詳盡、其革命態度之堅决、人格之偉大、令人欽敬無已、敝會痛念締造之艱難、慨夫國難之未已、除電質閻錫山同志外、誓率全省同志民衆、竭誠擁護我革命領袖蔣中正同志、尚祈全國各界一致主張、以遏邪說而安黨國、臨電神馳、無任翹企、中國國民黨江蘇省黨務整理委員會叩篠、</p>

<h3>我對這次分區賽後的廻感（下）李惠堂</h3>
<p>第二塲我們被罰的十二碼球、犯規是十八碼區域之外、不過他們的前鋒乘勢滾入内面罷了、最不解的他不知持何理由、竟公然把家球鎭和二友先後逐出塲去、他倆或者是罪有應得、然而比他倆得來兇險的華南某中衛、和踢至周守門脅骨幾斷的某前鋒、却能安然無事、那是他是使我大惑不解的事、</p>
<p>尚有最令我不满意的、葉君在分區大宴會的席上、居然夜郎自大地用英語當著外人面前來羞辱我們、他的居心何在、他的人格何在、眞使我不能瞭解、夫宴會之爲事、用以祛除芥蒂增進好感的、又何况我們是那次宴會的上賓、葉君自信聰明、對此顯而易見的禮儀也不懂、豈不是奇而又怪、葉君說、這次華東隊内被我逐出塲去那二位、請以後稍要注重精神方好、華東的隊長、最好多讀點規則、勸他的隊友宜從人格上用功、他這幾句帶譏帶嘲的英語、眞不是人類所應講的、從來我迫得起立致辯、我說這次不幸事的發生、我是極其抱歉、他倆值得被逐否、我且不管、不過我們在上海賽了多年的球、却從未被總會施罰過、我們自信對於體育精神、是非常的注重、是有非常的高尚成績、至於請我多讀球規一層、我添屬上海裁判會的一份子、除非港滬球類有歧異處、否則恐怕我不必再讀了、葉君啊、英語不是隨處可講的、望你以後審愼點才好、</p>
<p>除了以上關於裁判員的事實外、還有幾位巡邊員是使我非常鄙視、我敢說除了一位陳蘇君外、其餘曾作巡邊的人、都是心任左袒的、他們不惜以人格來交換他們的目的、這種朋友、祇可請他坐在塲邊替他的隊伍呐喊助威、那可給以中人地位巡邊職權呢、</p>
<p>末了、我覺得我們這次的分區、結果是非常美满、因爲在聯絡感情而言、我們確有深一層的友感在研究藝術而言、我們也多少領略點長處、在游覽方面而言、我們也飽嘗香江澳門和五羊的景色、在錦標方面而言、我們雖然是失敗、但是我們在那杯上已有二届的成績、將來你搶我奪、正可提高興趣、在發揚華東區球術而言、我們愼密的聯絡、我們傳遞攻守的佳妙、確已深印在南方人士的腦海、</p>
<p>因此我在收筆的當兒、我很希望以後的分區賽會、能一次次的把成績超越往昔、使今日蓓蕾的花朶成他日燦爛的果實、（完）</p>

<p>自由談一得之言  涂紅霞　　舊式婚姻的花轎。是變相的棺材。　　愛情是萬惡之源。也是萬苦之源。　　愛情是人們精神的墳墓。　　愛情是太陽光下的晨霜。　　造成痛苦的原料。愛情占百分之九十九。　　眞正的愛情。是在男女間没有公開結婚之前。　　愛情能使人哭。也能使人笑。　　愛情是堅固的鐐銬。　　爲了愛情而不進取。也有爲了愛情而拚命進取的。　　愛情能轉移人的生死。　　在愛情羅網裏的人們已經做了愛情的奴隸了。　　愛情好像冬日的河水。一凍住了就輕易不能融化。虚子譜  陶在東　　西文用標點。非所習。不敢議。中文則數十虚字。用之得法。無不可寫之狀。無不可傳之神。以言其易。慧童立解綴句成篇。以言其難。有老師宿儒。終身莫名其妙者。各舉最淺近之例。其一矣字。收煞詞也。而論語。子曰。甚矣吾衰也。吾不復夢見周公。若改作吾衰甚矣。便覺乏味。又子曰。巧言令色。鮮矣仁。口言鮮矣仁。意固是仁鮮矣。但矣字用於句末則呆。不如安置句中含意無盡。其二於字。用法如婦歎於室。如刑人於市。此一定之例。乃左傳楚令尹說平王釋吳囚。曰是室於怒而市於色也。以今俗語道之。便是在屋裏鬧氣。向街坊板面孔。文言之則怒於室而色於市也。左氏却隨意將兩名詞兩動詞上下移置。頓使於字精采百倍。其三之字。除訓爲往者如韓文之秦之楚句外。罕有用於句首者。惟莊子之調調。之刁刁等句。是寫風也。便覺满紙風物披離。問之字何解。苦不能答。更擬易以一字。苦不能得也。大抵此類周秦兩漢文中最多。三國去古未遠。則間有之。試舉人人所讀之隆中對。上言西川險富。劉璋　弱可取諸狀。結之曰。此殆天所以資將軍。將軍豈有意乎。豈有二字。詞意反戾。可謂不通。然語妙却正在此。蓋三分據蜀。備詎不知。備雖帝胄。璋亦天潢。捨曹孫而奪宗藩。爲說殊難啓齒。然取亂侮亡。時乎不再。天予不取。反受其咎。豈有二字。與上句殆字相呌應。有試探意。有儆動意。有還詰意。有激厲意。倘改爲其有意乎。或豈無意乎。神味索然矣。要之語助之詞。百數十字。而運用變化。氣象萬千。殆非西文標點所得窮其奥也。余昔課兒女。隨筆編虚字譜一書。首列小學源流解詁。中以俗諺證明用法。並博引經史詩文。排比對照。其罕用者歸末幅焉。稿經兵燹散佚。而體例在心。容補成之。或可爲學校參考自修及中年失學者研究入門之用耳。誌華探長季保霖  陳元良　　公共租界華探長季保霖。於本月三日逝世。一時警界同人。無分中外。咸爲惋惜。按季爲鹽城人。年四十四。服務警界。垂廿五載。初爲巡捕。旋由門差。包探。探目遽升而至探長。且下月一號有續升監察長之說。季身體魁梧。膂力過人。富有胆略。遇事奮勇當先。屢破匪窟。迭樹奇功。故得捕房奬狀者。季氏獨多。上月新閘路永泰里某號中。救獲肉票楊奎侯時。探夥皆惶悚不敢前進。而季毅然直赴樓上。叩亭子間門。綁匪聞聲啓關。以槍直指其胸膛。季亦以槍相向匪喉。迨匪按機時。季忽偏其體。彈由旁飛。季乃乘隙力扭匪肘。槍落卒被擒。其機警有如此者。事後楊感其救命之恩。特餽贈洋一千元。季不受。悉以分散其助手。據云季生平雖破獲綁案甚多。然受驚嚇無有勝于楊案者。逝世之時。適在友家雀戰。俄頃之間。魂歸緲渺。醫者稱爲腦充血症。舉殯之日。由其寓所聚慶里三六九號出發。經過大馬路。全班中西警士均爲執紼。氣象顯赫。無與倫比。彼時西探長愛司君。悲慟最深。蓋季爲伊之好友。且平素信任甚深。無論大小案件。必先與季商酌而後行。今兹驟失一臂。無怪其心之憂切也。季無嗜好。慷慨爲懷。平日依其爲生者爲數甚衆。且在日家中出入欵項。均自爲掌管。此次猝死。家人茫然無知。故身後倍極蕭條。遺有一妻一妾子四女六。長女廿一歲。字夢霞。曾畢業於慕爾堂中西女塾。貌娟秀。已遣嫁矣。季之幼女。則甫越週餘。食指浩繁。嗷嗷待哺。每逢午夜。妻兒啼哭。聲達户外。鄰人聞之。莫不爲之酸鼻。逆料季氏魂兮歸來。當亦泣下沾襟。欷歔不置也。鎭游一日記  張寄涯　　自長江遠望金焦二山。浮圖高聳。風景宜人。渴思登臨一眺者久矣。輒以嫁依人。終年栗六。竟無此閒情逸致。以了此夙願。月之八日。適值星期六。乃購一滬鎭來回車票。於下午三十五分啓行。至鎭已萬家燈火近黄昏矣。下榻鎭江飯店。夜眠苦早。索居無聊。遂驅車至天蟾舞臺。會坤伶小茹珍蘇三起解甫上塲。連演三堂會審。如珍窈窕多姿。歌聲宛轉。似覺此行不虚。直至終塲始行歸寢。翌晨仲直來。導游金山北固山。金山爲江天禪寺所掩映。及門不見有山。越殿拾級而上爲藏經樓。樓之左側。爲古法海洞。内塑法海像。相傳其洞通杭之飛來峯。其信然歟。洞之上有浮圖一座。登臨一眺。江天在望。胸襟爲之一寛。寺前數百步。長堤蜿蜒。老楊迎風。有屋三楹。曰王公祠。庭前砌石成池。周以石欄。内有泉自下湧。不舍晝夜。號曰天下第一泉。此泉初在江心。欲汲之者。須艤舟携瓶。沉入江心取之。故亦稱江心泉。今已滄桑變易。江流偏於瓜州。而泉則固仍在原處也。北固山岩壁峻峭雄偉。波浪拍岸成奇響。山下有觀音洞。山巓爲甘露寺。寺内有亭翼然。相傳爲孫夫人祭江之故址。其寺即劉備招親之處也。遠望焦山。俯視全鎭。歷歷如在目前。顧爲時所限。未能親歷其境。大好風景。祇有俟諸異日耳。　　鎭江雖爲今蘇省會。而市面不甚繁盛。郊外多荒蕪不治。道路狹隘。一如其他内地。最小客庽。尚有五十文一夜者。門懸大燈籠。上書耿大房戴二房等。自車站以至江邊。在在皆有。警務甚整飭。徹夜無倦容。清潔道路。尤無微不至。於此亦足覘新政府之吏治矣。諸曁西鄕之虎  樊蝶厂　　浙省諸曁西鄕之十三都。黄家湖村。相距二里許之鷄冠山。峯巒疊起。人跡罕至。地旣偏僻。山圍遼闊。平日間相傳有巨虎出現。鄕民入晚。均相戒不出。村民黄百有者偕同其子。及隣人張某。於日前登山捕獵。至山中。遽見後面來一巨虎。兩目炯炯如電。在山谷間徘徊。黄某見狀。乃齊舉獵槍。向尾射撃。彈中虎之腰部。乃大肆咆哮。其聲如雷。震動山谷。其時獵者面無人色。經一時之久。虎始息聲。後足倒地。前足直立不動。乃低頭而斃。黄某等立聚集鄕民。將虎抬回。於昨運至杭市。寓於板兒巷之曁陽旅舍内。一時聞者咸往一觀。該虎身長八尺有餘。重八百餘斤。體色有紋如柳條。頭額有王字。爲眞正之虎。雙目未閉。猶有生氣。旋爲大井巷胡慶餘堂藥店聞悉。向其論價購去。計大洋一千三百元。現陳列於胡慶餘堂藥號中。聞將製爲虎骨膏云。寒友宴梅補誌  柯定盦　　此間友人。前昨接紐約來電。謂梅蘭芳已安抵該埠。美人士赴站歡迎者甚衆。連日各處開盛大歡迎宴會者。殆無虚日。猶憶梅赴美時。道經滬瀆。與各界酬酢之盛。尚有一事。爲各報所未載。頗有足記之價值。爰補述一二。以實本談。或不以明日黄花見誚歟。　　梅郎離國前之四日。寒之友舊侣。邀梅郎歡叙於一品香餐室。主者經亨頣·于右任·康心之·到者商笙伯·黄賓虹·陳剛叔·張紅薇·馬孟容·馬公愚·鄭曼青·方介盦·張善孖·張聿光·俞寄凡·謝公展·洪麗生·李祖韓·李秋君·俞劍華·熊松泉·丁六陽·王陶民·諸書畫家二十餘人。鐘鳴一下。裙屐畢集。華筵初張。室内特置畫兒二。彩墨毫素俱備。諸人見之。莫不技癢。於是殺粉調朱。淋漓揮灑。俄頃之間。爛然满目矣。旣而啘華珊珊來。衆乃輟筆就席。傾觴互壽。酒數巡。畹華起謂。今日之會。與海上書畫名流。相晤於一室。詢匪易得。願諸君爲合作一幀。以資紀念。衆皆欣然應諾。席間孟容爲于梅二人速寫肖像。數分鐘而就。髯公畹郎。皆爲莞爾。諸人畫興。不能自遏。不待終席。紛紛離坐。繼續沈醉於筆飛墨舞之中。于髯雖屢屢大呼吃菜。而竟有充耳不聞者。經老素豪於酒。是日所作數幀自寫題句。醺醺之態。躍然紙上。諸人爲畹華合繪長卷一幀。長逾丈許。如天孫錦。如五侯鯖。𤈎爛華貴。得未曾有。今畹華已携此幀赴美以示彼都人士。爲宣傳吾國藝術之一助也。常識拾零  湯筆花　　馬路上遇着乞丐。跟在後面纒擾不休。只要對他說不要釘覊。乞丐就向後轉了。　　夜間跑到山梁雉妓很多的地方。最好找一個走路婦人。跟在伊的後面。遇到雉妓上前拖拉的時候。用手指着前面走路的婦人。雉妓知道有女人同行。早已退避三舍了。　　出門旅行。多帶幾張用不着的陳腐當票。放在身邊。時常摸進摸出。那麽給人瞧了。知道你是窮漢。再也不來看想你了。　　輪埠車站上的東西。切勿替人代拿。恐怕裏面藏着違禁東西。萬一抄獲。那時節有口難辯。所以這種方便是行不得的。心是温馨（一三一）  包天笑　　第八回　瓊筵開處嬌鳥啼花　金屋妝成良禽擇木　　果然那位雉王。不但是顔色美麗。而且性情温媚。譽之者。說伊出汙泥而不染。是花中之蓮。經不得大家一捧。這一節過去了。下一節便從野雞妓院。跳到了長三堂子。可是他們的地盤。還是在貴州路。他們是沿馬路的。門前有一扇雕鏤成冰梅花紋的闥門。上面裝了一盞白磁牛奶式的電燈。電燈上便有素君兩個紅字。生涯也好起來。每天的晚上。門前常停了不少的包車和馬車。本來從明鏡俱樂部到貴州路没有許多路。過了泥城橋向西一轉灣就到了。彦修别的地方不去。素君那個地方。忙裏偷閑的悄悄去了。譬如偶然來了幾位社友。他們說解解厭煩。不如叉八圈小麻雀吧。彦修是極力贊成慫恿着。可是他自已不叉。趁他高興的當兒。一轉瞬間。他就不見了。大家忽然想到。彦修怎麽不見。他到那裏去了。嚴一塵道。阿呀。一定到貴州路去了。到了他回來的時候。嚴一塵便問他可是到貴州路雉王那裏去了來。他便含笑不語。素君却也確有動人之處。凡是個女人。最關緊要的是那一雙眼睛。青矑一轉。足使魂消。素君的媚態。全在這一對秋波上。伊的眼睛大而深。睫毛是很長的。人家觀察女人眼睛的。有單眼皮。有雙眼皮之分。素君好像是有三眼皮。尤其是一笑之間。呈露了百媚。而盤是長長的。平日又是很靜。不大多說話。然而伊和彦修兩人在一處。或是在宴會的檯面上。兩人喁喁切切。好似有無數講不完的話兒。你想一個没有結婚過的鄭彦修。不用說是個用情極懇摯的青年。這時覺得女人之美。没有過於素君的了。而在素君雖然質美性良。無奈出身就墮落到一個不高貴的地方。以前所遇見的人。不客氣說都是那些粗人。現在却遇到這樣一位温文爾雅的貴家公子。并且傾心輸情的向伊。怎麽不教伊心满意足。快活得似飛上天去一般呢。只是傍邊急壞了這位時觀平先生。他說不好了。不好了。這一回彦修要墮入倚障了。這都是我的罪過。但是人生總有這一度戀愛。也逃不開的。不過從此以後。素君便釘住了彦修。死也不肯放。古人說的良禽擇木而棲。一個男人的出處遇合是如此。女人的欲得如意郎君。也是如此。正是世上易求無價寳。人間難得有情郎。　　欲知後事如何。且聽下回分解。</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論開幕在卽之紐約汽展會　　徐美烈　　增大機力爲本年新車之趨勢　　世界和平。交通發達。汽車之用途旣廣。而造車之業遂日興月盛。業此者苟不匠心獨運。推陳出新。以迎合世人喜新好奇之心理。則未有能久佔優越之地位者。歐美各製造家知其然也。對於新車之建造。靡不鬥角鈎心。以求盡善盡美。而博顧主之欣賞。每於一歲更始之際。輒各出産新車。互競營業。是年銷路之暢塞。往往於新車問世之時。即可預測之。且凡有所改良革新。復不自秘。歲必開會展覽。盡量披露。以供識者鑒評。一方面旣可資同業之互相觀摩。以作他山之攻錯。一方面復可吸引世人之一致注意。以作營業之宣傳。一舉而數善備。法至良也。迺者大地春回。歲序甫更。紐約一年一度之第三十次全國汽車展覽會。又以定期開幕聞矣。據紐約消息。會期已定在本月内。會塲仍設於大中央宫。與會廠家。將有四十餘家之衆。出品新車。約有三百餘種之多。五光十色。燦然大觀。其盛况必更逾於疇昔。本届陳列出品。除福特外。合衆國各廠家莫不參加。本年車輛革新之優點甚多。而以增大機力爲主要趨勢。各廠家之趨重於此。並非另造一機力擴大之發動機。乃在增加汽缸隻數。使機力與速率同時俱增。此實前此所未有者。美國汽車工業之發達。與年俱進。每於此會著其徵象。而本届之會。尤有顯而易見者在也六缸車行世以來。久已遐邇歡迎。繼之者有Ｖ形八缸。及Ｖ形士二缸車。最近則有直形八缸車。而在此次之會。將有雙八缸車即十六缸車之陳列。更使人耳目一新。其機力之增大。亦可想見矣。據地屈爾及其他城市報告。該地出品。現多趨向於四擋變速器之採用。此項新車行於三擋速度時。靜寂無聲。尤屬優點。又如二擋無聲之三擋變速器之採用。亦頗不少。六缸車用四擋變速器者有七家之出品。八缸車用四擋變速器者亦有同數。各廠出品中以六缸車爲最多。計有二十八家。八缸車二十三家。六缸八缸車均有出品者僅一家。至於四缸車則佔最少數。惟四缸車亦已增大機力。實爲一九三零年新車之特點。　　本届中央宫會塲之佈置。亦有革新表現。塲内有樓四層。規模宏壯。粉飾一新。每層室壁顔色各異。第一層樓飾以紅色與其他調和之色彩。第二層爲金黄色。第三爲綠色。第四則藍色也。所有一切點綴。無不矞皇雅麗。富有美術性。各式汽車。陳列其中。互相輝映。極燦爛之觀。會塲陳列之新式客車品類中。尚有計程徵費公用車一種。外國及美國出品各二輛。外國出産者爲墨喜德平士、MercedesBenz及沃新Voisin牌。美國製者有黄色及棋盤紋兩種。此項車輛之展覽。在昔已極引起觀衆之注意。其價值並不亞於通常之汽車也。　　會塲陳列除汽車爲主要品外。尚附有關於製造車輛之種種工具及設備。計分爲兩大類。參觀者可一覽無遺。一爲精製機件。與檢騐車輛之器具儀器。一爲用機器代人力工作之設備。此項展覽。每日將開至五時止。并由專家當衆試騐演講·以期觀者了解其作用。而免除揣測隔閡之疑點。　　本届陳列出品並不限於美國一處。各國出品。咸將儘量容納。故世界各國廠家。現均紛紛函託美國汽車商會辦公處。接洽陳列出品事宜。預料届時全球各汽車專業領袖。必均聯翩蒞臨。以襄盛舉。現有二十家汽車公司之董事長及總理。與汽車商會董事部重要人員。合組一歡迎委員會。以歡迎招待各國派來與會之代表。會期中並將召集美洲各廠專門家。共同討論關於汽車製造上及營業上之一切重要問題。以謀全世界交通之福利。　　從各點觀察。本届展覽會實具有種種特色。將在歷次展覽史上佔最有興趣最有價值之一頁紀錄。蓋美國各出品中旣含有種種之革新優點。一經披露。必能放一異彩。轟動世人觀聽無疑。而各國製造家之誠懇的被邀入會。自必有其新頴偉大之貢獻。爲斯會生色。亦可斷言。觀於現在多數廠家均願利用此機會一表現其最新出品之踴躍從事。即其明徵矣。駕駛方法與燃料之經濟關係徐美烈　　汽車界中有一極重要之問題。旣非設計造車之工程師所能預籌。亦非管理車輛者所可主宰。而獨爲駕車司機者所自操持。即車行里程與汽油用量之關係是也。此項關於汽油效率之重要問題。素爲用車者所極注意。曾經汽車工程師費長時間之研究。作種種試騐。以求解决之。但類皆含有專門科學的性質。須用特别工程儀器。極費手續。惟有一種試騐。尚稱簡便。爲一般人所易信服者。兹縷述如下。以見駕駛法之關係綦重焉。今有同一種類之兩車。裝用質量相等之汽油。將油管之輸送率調匀。同時出發。以不同之速度。馳於長約十八英里之平路上。並駕齊驅。同時終止。則其油日與里程之結果。竟不一致。蓋第一車之行駛速率屢變。每行十分之四哩。即停駛十秒鐘。變速棍自一擋移至二擋。速率在每小時三十六哩與四十哩之間。復移棍至三擋間。加快速率。以便追過第二車。如是旋停旋進。忽疾忽徐。快而至於六十哩一小時。遲而至於停止不動。每二車則行於每小時三十哩之均匀速率。歷行不變。迨行完此十八哩之路程。兩車同時終止。結果則第一車因速率變換。每加倫僅行十哩·又十分之四。第二車因速率平均。每加倫可行十九哩。相差至九·三哩之多。換言之。即第二車所用汽油。較第一車可節省百分之九十。相差幾及一倍。此項差異。全由駕駛方法之不同而起。因此可知。若司機者欲於二擋間柞高速率之行駛。則汽油難望節省。反之。若駕駛得法。開動時將變速棍撥在一擋與二擋間。然後移至高點。則其車之運用自較前者爲經濟。凡汽車之開停愈少。則汽油之節省愈大。　　駕車速率無論爲平均的。或變動的。與汽油經濟之關係均甚密切。而爲司機者所自操之。關於速率與燃料效率之問題。最近曾以車十六輛實騐之。車之種類不一。胥爲著名出品。以每小時十五哩之速率行駛。則各車平均每加倫汽油可行二十二哩又百分之十六。繼以二十五哩一小時之速率試之。則每加倫减行至二十里又百分之三十六。及速率增至一小時三十五哩。則汽油里程更低。每加倫僅行十八哩又百分之二十四。更增速至四十五哩一小時。則每加倫僅供十五·五一里之用矣。各車之中。雖不乏較佳之成績。與不及此數者。然自當以十六輛車試騐之平均數爲準也。速率而外。其他有關之問題固亦甚多。如車子狀况。風勢速度。化汽機之較正。燃料之品質。以及氣候。濕度·道路狀况。在在均與汽油效率有極重要之關係也。　　汽油效率之大小。繋乎駕駛方法之優劣。</p>

<p>旣如上述。此外尚有一極重要之影響。厥惟風之阻力。蓋當車行速率增大之際。則空氣因受劇烈衝盪而生風。隱成一種阻力。於是驅車前進之馬力勢必增大以抵抗之。是項馬力之所需。每與車身之前方面積成正比例。質言之。即車前面積愈大。則風之阻力愈强。而所需之馬力必愈多。是故風阻之主因。完全繋於車前之面積。間接即影響於汽油之效率。若當一小時三十哩以上之速率。則風力之影響。尤重大於低速率之行車也。關於此點已由實騐證明。有車二輛。重量各異。輕者體重二千七百五十七磅。車前面積爲二十四·九平方呎。重者有四千五百四十磅。面積廣二十九·六平方呎。兩相比較。重車較輕車重逾百分之六十五。而其前方面積則較輕車僅大百分之十六。當行於一小時二十哩之速率時　輕車每加倫汽油行二十四·六哩、重車則行一十三·四哩。即輕車較重車多佔百分之八十三之便宜。繼行於四十哩一小時。輕車第加倫得二十·四哩。重車得十二·八哩。即輕車獲益百分之五十九。復將速率增至六十哩。則前者每加倫僅行九·八哩。後者亦行八·二哩。即輕車祇得百分十九之利益。更以七十哩一小時之速率試之。前者每加倫縮至七·二哩。而後者則爲六零二哩。兩者相權。輕車所獲之便宜。竟降至百分之十六矣。由此以觀。足見車行速率與風之阻力。有至大之影響。更可知燃料之消耗率。與車前面積關係甚重。而與車身重量則較微。質言之。即輕車前面略小。利於緩行。重車前面雖大。利於疾馳。此僅就燃料效率而言。至若其他各點。則又當作别論也。法國汽車事業之近况　　與美國競爭甚烈　　近來歐洲各國之汽車事業。其發展之神速。除英國而外。當推法國。惟法國之人民。其購車力量。頗爲薄弱。設與美人相較。則相差三分之一。蓋法國勞工。以目前之經濟情形而言。欲求購一汽車。須節省其薪水一年有半。而美人則四五月足矣。此所以美法兩國之汽車事業。大相遥庭。而人數與車輛之比率。亦更懸殊。據最近調查。美國五人中有一汽車。而法國則三十六人中僅有汽車一輛也。法國各汽車廠。有鑒於斯。乃不得不設法補救。而近來補救之方法。一方利用政府之力量。加重汽車之進口稅。使美國汽車。不能行銷於法國市塲。一方增加産量。俾可與美國汽車作劇烈之競爭。此固完美之營業政策也。　　法國各汽車廠。旣利用上述方法。與美國競爭。於是汽車之産量。日形加增。而成本方面。反日見低廉。使美國汽車。運往法國者。雖有重大之進口稅。而售價竟不可增加。同時法國汽車。因生産之過剩。成本之便宜。故售價反日益低廉。以事實而言。法國汽車。自一九一三年以迄今日。售價方面。固逐年在低减也。同樣之汽車。在一九一三年售價須八、五００金法郎者。今日五、０００法郎足矣。美國之汽車事業。其發展之速。本爲全世界之冠。是故世界各國。汽車市塲之上。莫不有美國汽車之足跡。而美國之執全世界汽車事業之牛耳也。亦有年矣。年來歐洲各國。對於美國之汽車事業。競爭日烈。而其中尤以法人爲甚。回憶一九一四年之時。法國各廠所産汽車。僅能行銷於歐洲各地。至一九二０年前後。美國汽車市塲之上。亦漸有法國汽車之行銷矣。當大戰之時。法國實業停頓。美國汽車。當是時也。乃得盛銷於法國。除法國而外。其他各參戰國亦然。美國汽車之能銷行於歐洲大陸。此殆爲一大原因也。　　大戰之時。美國汽車之運往法國者。爲數實屬不少。迄今法國各省。仍有戰時舊式汽之行駛途中。其中單就貨車一項。戰時美國運往法國者。計有三二、０００輛。經此大戰。美國各汽車廠。始發現歐洲各國。堪以推銷汽東。於是竭其全力注意於歐洲之汽車市塲。歐洲人民。性好美觀。其中尤以法人爲甚。此種心理。在最近二三年中。美人早已窺透。各廠曾派人至歐洲各地。經一度詳細之考察。已深知歐人所喜之車身。、於是年來美國汽車在歐洲之銷路。頓時日見發展。惟法國汽車市塲。年來銷車紀錄。較他國不同。蓋法國各廠。最近所製車輛。完全模倣美國出品。與美國競爭日烈。要亦美國汽車在歐洲銷路之重大打撃也。以目前之趨勢而言。在最近二三年間。法人購車之目標。或將注重於機件而不注重於形式也。他如小規模之汽車廠。與各大廠相互合作。營業亦大有發展也。以事實而言。法國之汽車事業。近來與美國作極力之競爭。而銷路方面。亦確有起色。惟德國各廠。近來亦大有發展。此殆爲法國各廠之一大障碍也。且歐洲各國政府。近來均有限制美國汽車進口之方法。一年之中。不得超過規定數量。此種政策。究竟有無違反各友邦和平條約之處。蓋亦爲一嚴重問題。關稅方面。旣力事增加。而車輛之進口。又加以限制。此實不合理之舉動也。法國之汽車事業。對於美國之競爭。旣如上述然法國之汽車。是否能適合法人之心理。又爲一大問題。蓋法人購車。近來主要目的。在求機件之耐用。車價之低廉。至於出品之是否　　　　　　　　　　　第二問題也。故法人要求汽車事業之發展。當注重於車身之優劣。及價格之貴賤也。討論上海公共汽車擁擠問題　　徐美烈　　將用雙層式汽車解决之　　上海因交通便利。百業發達。四方之民。風從雲集。年來人口之激增。有加無已。地狹人稠。不特居住大感困難。而摩肩擦榖。行路亦殊匪易。試觀每日馳驅大道。盈千累萬之車輛。何一而非满載乘客。私家自用車之發達。始且不論。僅就公衆乘用者而言。幾無時無處而不满坑满谷。擁擠凌亂之情形。實爲空前鮮有。是故「行」之一字。與「住」之一字。在上海市民心目中。均認爲同一重要同一急切之問題矣。按滬地普通公用之車。除人力車。電車外。厥惟公共汽車。當其發軔之時。因路綫有限。取價頗昻。（公司開辦之初。所收車資。本以銀幣爲單位。行之約及兩年。而結果公司頗有虧損。因乘客之數不多。其收入殊不足以敷開支。乃不得不變更方針。減低車資。將銀本位改爲銅本位。）市民覺其反不如電車之便利。乘者殊不踴躍。嗣因加闢路線減低車資。搭客乃日增月盛。至於今日。求過於供。亦起擁擠之患。其情狀正不亞於電車。就大勢觀之。公共汽車旣較一般車輛爲便。將來多數人民。必均棄用别種車輛。而羣趨於此。是非臆測之辭。固有事實可證。蓋一則昔日盈千盈萬之人。向爲電車主顧者。現皆舍彼而就此。良以電車行駛旣笨而緩。常有貽誤。司機人對於開車之疾徐。往往失其平衡。有時路上車輛繁多。開駛過速。</p>

<p>不　自行趨　。每易肇禍。有時車　　少。反而緩駛。虚耗無限時間。又如一車因故中途停頓不進。則他車往來均被阻斷。非待恢復。不能前進。種種延誤。每令乘客生厭。而在公共汽車。則絕少此項弊病也。一則由於嚮日乘用人力車之大多數人民。除特别原因外。現均喜乘公共汽車。以其行駛穩速。而價復低廉。實優於人力車倍蓰。惟人力車利於短距離與夫特别需要之乘坐。將來縱不免減少至最小之數。然終不能消滅淨盡。今後公衆交通工具上之强烈競爭。乃在電車與公共汽車之間。中國公共汽車公司有鑒於此。欲謀戰勝電車。并爲解决擁擠問題。以謀公衆利益計。一面力圖車務之改良。一面復有上下兩層式汽車之採用。此實救濟辦公時間内繁忙擁擠之唯一方法也。在過去十八個月中。車輛之增至。雖較初時已達二倍。然與交通發展之需要相比較。仍苦不足以應付。公司董事會用特呈准公共租界及法租界市政當局。决計試用雙層汽車。行駛界内。其所增益之數。雖不能即適合於現今單層車輛中擁擠所需之空間。却可增多椅座容積。减少站立地位。使乘客稍感舒適焉。惟此種雙層車輛車身甚高。行駛道上。尚有種種障碍。如道旁低垂之樹枝。及街上密佈之線。均足妨碍之。幸賴市政當局之指導協助。及新車車身之特别設計。可以克勝一切困難。現在業已着手如法建造。除定造雙層式車身外　　　　　　　。以便增多車輛班次。俾得减少乘客候車之時間。而免除擁擠之患。定貨單業已發出。大約兩三月内。新車即可出現於滬市矣。公司又以實心輪胎之震動劇烈。旣不適於乘客。而納捐又重。已於數月前議决購進許多應用材料。以便改用打氣輪胎。若果試用满意。則所有各實心輪汽車。將盡易以打汽輪胎。此項改良。於乘客之舒適安全。關係甚巨。他日乘客之因此益增。固屬意中事也。　　近世車輛種類繁多。各有其相當之功用。而行駛時所佔道路之地位與時間。亦各有不同之關係。細究之。亦一饒有趣味之問題。據車務專家統計。試以六輪雙層公共汽車可載客六十八人者。行駛滬市。核其所佔道路面積。不過二百二十五平方呎。若行於每小時十五哩之速率。則經過某一定點之時間。僅需一·三六秒。復以較小之車兩部能載同數客人者試之。則所佔面積爲三百八十平方呎。所需時間爲二·四０秒。如將此六十八客分載尋常汽車。假定平均每三人坐一車。則佔路面至一千七百零四平方呎。需時十六秒。更以人力車載之。分成兩列。長三百五十五呎。則佔地竟達三千零七十六平方呎之多。行過定點需時四十八秒半之久。互相比較。可見雙層公共汽車在交通繁忙之道上。實爲最經濟的。滬市之採用此種車輛。實甚合宜也。日本交通之科學管理林　　一、交通管理　二、交通管理器具之變遷　　三、有色信號在歐美之地位　四、非科學管理所受之損失　　五、設施改良之急務　　一、交通管理　　自工業革命以來。最顯著之現象。莫如人口集中於都市。因人口之集中。都市生活。就隨之異常發達。於是都市之交通。亦突飛猛進。而各種交通用具之發達。更爲顯著之事實。十八世紀末葉。英人瓦特發明蒸汽發動機。引起工業大革命。而汽車之發明。亦開交通界之新紀元。汽車之出現。尚屬近世之新發明。而現成之道路。多爲數十年或數百年前之舊建築。非預知此種高速力車輛出現而作成者。故不適於今日之趨勢。自不待言。　　綜觀疾驅道上之各種交通用具。其逐年數量增加之迅速。殊堪驚異。　　最近二十年間東京車輛統計表　　年别　汽車　電車　脚踏車　人力車　貨車　其他　合計　　明治四三年　九六　一、一一二　一九、九二三　二六、七九二　一五二、九七九　二０九　二０一、一一一　　四四年　一八八　一、一四二　二五、三三四　二三、六二六　一五五、六二七　二一二　二０六、０二九　　大正元年　二九八　一、二四八　三二、０九二　二三、三六一　一五六、三八一　一八四　二一三、五六四　　二年　四五五　一、四八０　三九、三四八　二二、二七０　一四六、二五二　二五六　二一０、０六一　　三年　五一七　一·五一五　五三·三九四　二０、五四六　一六四·五五五　二一七　二四０·六四四　　　四年　六一０　一·五五二　六四·一三九　一八·六三一　一六三·八０七　二一二　二四八·九五二　　五年　八四一　一·五八０　九八·五四三　一八·二四一　一六四·四五九　一二七　二八三·七九一　　六年　一·三一一　一·五八０　一０四·六五七　一八·一八三　一六六·四七四　一０九　二九二·三一四　　七年　一·八一五　一·五九０　一二五·二０九　一六·０二四　一六九·０七一　一一二　三一三·八一九　　八年　三·０五六　一·六三五　一四八·０七九　一七·九二八　一五八·七二一　一二０　三二九·五三九　　九年　三·六九五　一九九一七　一七六·五七三　一八·九六八　一六二·四九五　八九　三六二·七三七　　十年　四·０九七　一·八九七　二一四·九七五　一七·六九五　一五八·三四一　二八四　三九七·二八九　　十一年　四·八五二　二·０四五　二六０·二四六　一六·六二六　一五八·九三九　六九　四四二·七七七　　十二年　四·四五九　一·三六九　二四一·六二六　九·七四五　一二九·一二八　三九０　三八六·四五七　　十三年　一０·三三八　二·０一一　三五０·八一七　一一·四０三　一五六·四八七　九　五一一·二００　　十四年　二·三三六　一·九七四　三九七·六一０　九·九０六　一五一·七七五　一三　五七二·四一五　　昭和元年　一三·一六三　一·八九七　四二六·八六二　八·七七六　一四二·七八七　八七八　五九四·三六三　　二年　一六·一四五　一·八０七　四三九·一五五　六·七九四　一四二·七八八　一·九００　六０八·五八九　　三年　二０·五二六　一·八九六　四四０·五六四　一二六·九九三　（未完）消息湖南公路局現狀來　　湖南建設事業。公路局算是一件最大的事。從前民辦中西南三汽車路局。現在政府把它統一起來。改爲公路。公路局究竟所做的事如何。成績如何。恐外間不明眞相。兹詳載如下。公路整理之原則。不外下列四點。一。關於消費的支出應力圖减少。二。關於生産的收入。應設法增加。三。關於未成的路。進行要快。四。關於已成的路。管理要得法。現在公路局。對於這四點的工作。試先就第一點言。消費分工程。材料。及局用經費三種。工程費。據上次工路籌備委員會接收人員說。西路</p>

<p>的常桃路。六十　里明的用去五十八萬。暗中不能算賬的。聽說一共有一百多萬。而所修的路。據周總工程師說。將來不能行車。要修過一條。才好。是常桃六十里路。明的暗的。一共一百多萬元。其結果路不能作用。南路的潭衡路。據調查報告。從前已經用去的錢。每里亦在六千元上下。是從前所修的路。耗費的錢很多。這都是已往的事實。於今可以不說了。現在公路局對於工程費。確立預算。據稱照從前省内所修的路。比較每里只需三千餘元。劉局長聲明。可以負責。即就一件事而論。由益陽至常德間有一座大橋。從前估算工程費十餘萬元。現在公路局估計六七萬元。可以辦到。由此類推。假定湖南每年修一千里路。每里最少可望節省一千五百元。估計一共可以節省達一百五十萬元。材料費。就購置汽車一項而言。公路局議訂之價。比從前所買的汽車一樣的牌子。一樣的大小。每輛已經减少六百元了。而公路局尚未承認。據說將來一定要達到减少一千元。在十九年中。公路局預算。要買汽車二百輛。這一筆又可省二十萬元。又從前汽車每百輛。每年需修理機件費一千元。現在公路局嚴密規定。每輛汽車。每年修理費以三百元爲限。以現有的汽車一百二十輛計算。每年可省七萬。若至本年底。增加汽車二百輛。一共可省二十萬元。又汽油費。照現在整理狀况每輛平均每年可省油費二百四十元。每年共省三萬元。若至十九年底。推算可省九萬元。局内經常費。公路局全局開支。以從前三個路局比較。每月節省約八千元。每年約省九萬餘元。又各路工程處。在湘南方面。裁去職員夫丁數十人。計月省二千元。湘西方面。裁减節省月約少六百餘元。惟各路管理處。各站長。及稽查人員薪水因欲其養廉起見。略爲增如。計每月比從前加多約一千二百元。局外工程處。與管理處比較。每月尚省一千四百元。每年省一萬六千元。總計局内外開支。每年較前省十萬元。總計消費一項。以十九年底計算。每年减少在二百一十萬元上下次就第二點言。查已成五路。（長寳。衡柳。長茶。長寗。常桃。）最近五個月來。收入數目。計八月份。共收十一萬一千零。九月份。十一萬五千零。十月份。十二萬五千零。十一月份。十一萬九千零。十二月份。祇調查上半月統計五萬七千零。比五個月中。八月份係民辦期間九十兩月。係公辦籌備期間。十一十二兩月。爲公路局接辦期間。就中比較。十月份收入爲最多、十一月份次之。八月份爲最低。以我個人看來。自十一月半起。以至現在。雨雪甚多。天凉不能行車。加以前八師少數不肖官兵。不免有强迫乘車之事。路收雖受影響。然尚能整頓。收入達十一萬九千零。實認爲一可抱樂觀之事。政府前慮軍人破壞要政。特派軍運委員。常川駐站。極力防範現已整理就緒。據路局云。業已恢復原狀。余想以後。再不有此等事實發生。余又曾問劉局長。將來營業狀况。彼謂十九年底。能增長路線一千四五百里。省内重要市鎭。如衡州常德等處。次第通車。每月收入。可辦到近三十萬元。再次就第三點言。湖南汽車路除由長沙至湘鄕一段。一百八十里不計外。其餘屬於民辦通車共有八百驛里。費時五六年。昨公路局報告工程狀况。據稱全省十六幹線。四個月後。可通車者。三百里。六個月後。可通車者七百六十五里。十個月後可通車者。二百四十里。約計待支洋三百一十九萬三千六百元。倘能於十個月内先後核發上項所載待支欵項。即可於民國十九年十月底完成路線一千三百餘里。通車營業云云。由此看來。從前民辦五六年完成路工。八百驛里現在公路局接辦一年内。可成一千餘里。在四個月内衡州可通車。在六個月内常德可通車。兩相比較。則公路局工程進行。比從前快得多。此又一極可樂觀之事。最後就第四點言。考查公路局兩月來對於各路管理方法整理。亦頗努力。如整理機務整理車務。取消免票。嚴定司機生賞罰章程。改善營業辦法。規定長寳通票車時間。頒布管理處各項日報表。最近劉局長出巡考察之後。又積極籌畫建造潭寳段修理廠。湘潭。寳慶。兩處車庫油池。及司機生寄宿舍。凡此種種。均屬目前整理急務。該局能洞見癥結。次第施行。我想再過二三月整理期間。該局成績。必更有可觀。今天我把公路局兩月來工作情形。大概已經報告完畢了。此外我又還有一種感想。再來說明一下。從前民辦汽車路經過五六年的歷史。何以不能辦好。消費上一切支出。何以不能减省。生産上收入。何以不能增加。路工進行。何以不能迅速。管理法何以不能改善。甚至翻車出險。視爲固常。無形損失。不計其數。此種原因究竟安在。一經收歸公辦之後。何以不到兩月。就能如此改良。如消費節省週年以二百萬計路工進行之速一年成績幾乎以從前五六年成績有餘。這豈不是駭人聽聞嗎。究竟這種原因。又在那里呢。我以爲辦理一事。成績良否。全在立法是否完善。以爲轉移。從前民辦路務。其毛病在組織不完善。每一局有一局的常駐委員。局長由委員會選出。遇事必聽命於委員之下。用人行政多不自主。其精力只夠應付環境。不能從事整理。此爲民辦最大之病源。現在公路局成立。當局長的。事權統一。毫無顧慮。故能專心研究。切實整理。如此次嚴訂司機生賞罰章程。凡行車出險者。司機生送法院懲治。則司機生有所畏懼。翻車的事自然絕少。機務上嚴切整理。則壞車之事减少。修理機件費因之節省。調度車輛得法。自然行車不至放空。節省油費不貲。頒布站長及司機生日報表。則管理方面。不能舞弊。規定長寳通票車時間。則旅客方便。又改善營業辦法。收入大可增加。如從前潭寳路貨物堆積如山。無車裝運。一經整理。嚴限每日車行里數。旬日之間。已變爲有車無貨。前後判若天壤。可見事在人爲。整理不患無術。一照公路局現在的計畫做下去。我相信三五年後。不獨湘省發展。即財政上亦有莫大之裨益。一週間汽車肇禍記三原　　日期　地址　汽車號碼　受傷人　傷勢　最後情形　　十一日　體修會路　某號　陸姓女孩　重傷身死　候拘車夫究辦　　十二日　杜美路　兩車互撞　受傷三人　各受微身　送院醫治　　十三日　邁而西路　兩車互撞　一死一傷　傷人送院醫治　　十五日　四川路　某號　張姓小孩　足部微傷　同右　　十七日　三條巷　一０九三　徐姓男女　男孩女傷　同　右　　一週間汽車肇禍。共有五起。内因重傷身死者。計男子一人。男孩一名。女孩一名。輕傷者計男子四人。男孩一名。女孩一名云。譯叢海外汽車界瑣聞談紫電　　去年英國機器脚踏車之出口數。較之前年。有增無已。查去年自六月起至十二月止。機器脚踏車之出口總數。共計八五·四二九輛。而前年同時期内。僅五四·四四七輛。已不可同日而語。至機器脚踏車零件方面。亦異常激增。蓋前年出口貿易總額。爲一·０七七·七二０金鎊。至去年已增至一·八八九·八二五金鎊。　　據美國汽車界中人調查所得。歐洲西北方之冰洲上。現有六百零二輛汽車行駛於道上。誠難能而可貴也。　　史蒂芬君。現爲美國印地安那州根斯勃地方之赫達森汽車售車人。今年已八十九歲。爲世界汽車推銷員之資格最老者。彼於五十年前。即已擔任司蒂倍克汽車公司之推銷員。故其於美國汽車界之過去情形。瞭似指掌。　　汽車肇禍。大都由於駕駛者年齡較輕所致。蓋若輩年幼學淺。經騐缺乏。每駛過熱閙之區。輙心慌意亂。易釀禍端。年來美國汽車肇禍。日益增多。市政當局。常開會公開討論。防止汽車肇禍之策。曾有人提議。限止駕車人之年齡。凡在二十歲以内之青年。均不准駕駛汽車。若是。則汽車肇禍。或可漸見减少也。聞此項提議贊成者頗衆。不久可以見諸實行云。專件英華汽車名詞錄（十一）　　丁祖澤　　Compressionstroke壓汽衝程　　Consrmption消費量　　Concentricpistonring偏心活塞環　　Concentriclloat偏心浮筒　　Condensation凝結　　Condenser凝電器　　Conductor導體（電）　　Cone錐、錐形　　Coneclrtch錐形分合機　　Connectingrod連桿　　Connectingrodbearing連桿軸承　　Connection接合　　Connectioninparallel並接（電）　　Connectioninseries直接（電）　　Connector接合物　　Contactbreaker斷電器　　Contaotpoint接觸點（電）　　Contactscrew斷電螺絲釘　　Controlbrush調整電刷　　Controlsystem駕駛機系統　　Cord索　　Cordtire索胎、並織胎　　Core鐵心（電）　　Corkfloat軟木浮筒　　CorkGasket軟木襯片　　Cotter開口梢　　Cotterpin　　Cotterremover拆開口梢鉗　　徵求本刊　讀者如有本報本年二月五日之本刊願割愛者。請郵寄本埠北揚子路三號通用公司ＬＴＬiang收。有相當酬報。後至郵璧。</p>

<h3>The Three Presidents of the National Government Telegraph Yan Xishan Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The three presidents of the National Government telegraphed Yan Xishan again on the 18th, saying: "President Yan Baichuan of the Taiyuan Deputy Commander's Office, greetings. The confidential telegrams from yesterday and today have been received successively. After careful reading, we know that your idea is to prioritize courtesy for the sake of the nation, and to take responsibility while in opposition, and to organize a senate of elder statesmen while in opposition to quell the chaos. We deeply admire this. If we may offer our humble opinions for further discussion, we are confident that you will have brilliant insights for the benefit of the nation and the people. However, being in opposition and taking responsibility are mutually exclusive. Since you have not forgotten your concern for quelling the chaos, you should strengthen the central government. Having read your previous and subsequent telegrams, although the wording differs, the intention is the same. If you can, as you suggest, conduct thorough research and calm down to study, and suggest to the central government that the entire party should decide everything, then not only will the party and the nation benefit, but you can also avoid the suspicion of dominating the party and the nation with your sole opinion. We are very impressed and appreciative that you mentioned the example of the Meiji Restoration in Japan to enlighten us. Our party adheres to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and takes governing the country by the party as its sole objective. Of course, the party's authority is above all else. However, the wise men of Choshu and Satsuma did not retire to their domains, nor did they resign, but exerted all their efforts to protect the central government, and the cause of the Meiji Restoration in Japan was achieved. As your clear analogy suggests, you should hold a high position in the central government and assist in the tutelage. The idea of resigning is even more difficult to justify. As for the claim that the whole country is in uproar, we do not know to what you are referring. Who is making the clamor, and who is stirring up the trouble? Now that the people's hearts are settling down and the rumors have not ceased, it is deeply worrying that such alarming words are coming from your mouth, and the impact will be significant. We here have been able to remain calm and restrained in times of crisis, and this is one reason why. We hope that you will consider the importance of the responsibility entrusted to you and the wide dissemination of your words, and pay close attention to the hidden nuances. We are grateful for your teachings and offer our thoughts in return. We respectfully seek your wise guidance. Your brothers, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, and Wang Chonghui, bow." (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Generals Jointly Telegraph Yan to Awaken</h3>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun received a telegram from Chiang on the 17th, providing instructions regarding Yan's "grey" telegram. That evening, he convened a meeting at the headquarters, gathering Xu Yuanquan, Wang Jinyu, Xia Douyin, Jiang Dingwen, Wang Jun, Yang Shengzhi, Chen Cheng, Luo Lin, Zhao Guantao, and other senior generals. They unanimously resolved to jointly telegraph Yan with advice, urging him to awaken. The telegram is currently being drafted and will be sent on the 18th. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun and Zhang Xueliang telegraphed on the 15th, expressing their dissatisfaction with Yan's "grey" telegram. They have telegraphed Yan to urge him to apologize to the central government as soon as possible and not to burden the people again. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the New Hubei Provincial Committee</h3>

Liu Wendao presided over the oath-taking ceremony on behalf of the central government, and Zhang Fujia presided over the ceremony on behalf of the Executive Yuan of the National Government. Liu Wendao, as Chairman, presented the seals of office and gave a speech. Zhang Fujia gave a speech. He Chengjun responded, saying that he came here to work, not to be an official. The heads of various committees and departments also came to reorganize the local construction and revolutionary cause. In the future, suppressing bandits will be the top priority. Director Wu Xingya has a very comprehensive plan, and he hopes that both the party and the government will work together harmoniously. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Pacification Conference</h3>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Resignation of the French Cabinet</h3>
<p>French Prime Minister Tardieu resigned his cabinet suddenly during the critical moment of the disarmament conference. Observers must suspect that there is a significant relationship involved. However, in reality, it is not only unrelated to the disarmament issue, and at most will only delay negotiations for a few days, but also will not have any significant impact on French domestic affairs.</p>
<p>Why? Because the fall and formation of cabinets in France is an extremely common occurrence. After the European War, France had no long-term cabinet such as Painlevé, Briand, or Herriot. All of them resigned and re-formed, formed and resigned countless times. The reason is that after the European War, finances were difficult to manage and budgets were difficult to resolve. The Minister of Finance is often in a difficult and arduous situation. If they pay a little attention to government revenue, they will provoke criticism from the people. If they pay a little attention to the people's burden, they will incur dissatisfaction from the government. Therefore, even if a single problem arises, disputes will arise in the parliament, and they will be noisy and accuse each other. As a result, they either leave in anger or resign under attack. The cabinet cannot but fall with them. The frequent reorganization of the French cabinet and the hectic replacement of finance ministers after the war are all due to this. And this time, the resignation of the Tardieu cabinet is also due to budget issues. The main point is simply to change the Finance Minister. The easy downfall of French cabinets is due to the divisions within political parties. There is no strong and clear major organization, and the various small parties are constantly changing and merging. The combination of political parties is not solid, and the foundation of the cabinet itself is not solid, so it is naturally easy to shake. Furthermore, from the government's point of view, French law grants the President the power to dissolve parliament, but after trying it once in 1877, in view of the many disputes and difficulties, even when the government and parliament disagree, the government would rather yield than advocate dissolution. Therefore, the dissolution has never been realized. As a result, the power of the parliament has become increasingly heavy. The result of the contention is only one method: the resignation of the cabinet. This is also one of the reasons for the easy downfall. However, although the cabinet falls frequently, those who succeed in forming a cabinet are still among the key figures in this political situation. Therefore, it has no impact on the political situation. Today's Paris dispatch said that the cabinet crisis came suddenly, and the left-wing parties are determined to make things difficult for the government. This is just speculation.</p>

<h3>French Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>Tardieu to Reorganize Cabinet</p>
<p>No Impact on Naval Policy</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th - In the budget bill, an article concerning the estimated income tax for small shopkeepers' wives was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies by 286 votes to 281 today. The government was defeated. The government had treated this matter as a vote of confidence and has therefore resigned. The Chamber of Deputies has adjourned indefinitely. Reuters, Paris, 17th - The Chamber of Deputies' vote was unfavorable to the government. Since the government treated this as a matter of confidence, it had no choice but to resign. After the failure of the bill, the cabinet members immediately convened and decided to visit Prime Minister Tardieu, who was in bed due to illness. Two cabinet members went to his bedside and helped the Prime Minister draft his resignation letter. The remaining cabinet members waited in the outer chamber. Shortly thereafter, all cabinet members, except for Tardieu, who was ill, and Navy Minister Le Bigot, who remained in England, entered the Presidential Palace to submit their resignation letters. Another telegram stated that the French President has accepted the cabinet's resignation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 18th - The political storm of Tardieu's cabinet collapse came suddenly. However, since the left-wing parties were determined to make things difficult for the government, this political storm was not entirely unexpected. Tardieu formed his cabinet last October after Briand resigned as Prime Minister. This year, he first worked hard in The Hague and then negotiated in London, fulfilling his duties diligently and becoming ill as a result. Recently, he has been traveling between London and Paris because he had to temporarily return to Paris to handle domestic affairs personally. Reuters, London, 17th - According to the opinions expressed by the French delegation in London, the failure of the French government will not affect the delegation. It is likely that the French President will ask Tardieu to reorganize the cabinet and replace the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 18th - The French Chamber of Deputies overthrew the government while the London Naval Conference was in full swing, and the French newspapers are full of discontent, comparing this to the self-respect of the British House of Commons. Although the left-wing newspapers are now demanding the formation of a new government, all left-wing parties unanimously advocate Tardieu's return to office, believing that Tardieu is the only one who can defeat Britain's strategy of binding France's hands at the naval conference.</p>
<h3>Ratio of Capital Ships</h3>
<p>Japanese Plenipotentiary Making Efforts to Negotiate with the U.S.</p>
<p>The Opinions of Both Sides Still Have Not Converged</p>
<p>Dentsu, London, 17th - The results of the Anglo-American-Japanese conference held on the 17th at St. James's Palace are being kept secret by all countries. Judging from various sources, the attitude of Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki is very firm, refuting the U.S.'s 60% proposal with all his might. He said that Japan's demand for 70% is to fully adhere to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and not to threaten any country. As for the U.S.'s 60% proposal, it threatens Japan and violates the spirit of the anti-war treaty. The reason why the meeting time was extended was that Japan and the U.S. exchanged strong opinions on this matter, and as a result, the 60% and 70% proposals remained far apart, so the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - The meeting of the chief representatives of the UK, US and Japan to discuss the ratio of battleships is the most important meeting related to the Naval Conference today. According to responsible sources, the Conference is currently deeply studying the numerical issue. If a country proposes a large and substantial number, the ratio will be affected, so it is not possible to hope for major progress for a while. But although it seems slow on the surface, much work has already begun behind the scenes. At present, no country has revised its demands. Today, the spokesman of the British delegation said that the issue of concluding the Locarno Treaty for the Mediterranean has not been formally raised in the venue. Such political issues require the attendance of the Mediterranean coastal countries. Furthermore, this Naval Conference is not related to the status of Germany, as the German procedure is something that the Disarmament Preparatory Committee should handle. Reuters has learned that the rumor that the naval representatives of Britain, France, and the United States had a disagreement on February 14, and that the US representative Stimson angrily withdrew, is completely unfounded. The discussion among the three countries' representatives on that day was very peaceful. Today, experts considered the issue of special ships, especially how to replace a layer of special ships, but no agreement was reached. British officials firmly denied the rumor that they had contacted Germany about "pocket battleships" (the name given by the world to the new type of warship built by Germany). Press sources revealed that France has not agreed to reduce the figures proposed by French Prime Minister Tardieu on February 12, and this matter is quite thorny, causing progress to be hindered, and other countries will have to reconsider the overall situation. For example, the UK's agreement to reduce cruisers to 50 ships is based on its expected results. Although the UK may not necessarily increase its numbers now, it will definitely give careful consideration to the overall situation. A London newspaper pointed out that the French memorandum was a major blow to the prospects of the Naval Conference, and French newspapers have therefore made dissatisfied criticisms. Therefore, today the British government spokesman declared to foreign reporters that the British government has absolutely no relationship with any British newspaper or news agency. Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th - Representatives of powerful news newspapers here have organized a special reporter group for the Disarmament Conference. Their purpose is to encourage the Japanese Plenipotentiary delegation attending the London Conference in the name of the Japanese people. The group set off for England yesterday. After arriving in England, in addition to encouraging the Japanese Plenipotentiaries, they will visit the Plenipotentiaries of various countries, express Japan's enthusiasm and hopes for disarmament, and strive to seek understanding from all parties. The group will also travel to various countries on the way to and from the UK and Japan, inspect privately-run shipyards to provide references for future disarmament issues.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Election Ends Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Ballots Counted on the 23rd, All Completed</p>
<p>Provisional Parliament to Be Convened in Mid-April</p>
<p>Hamaguchi Returns from Canvassing, Voice Hoarse from Exhaustion</p>
<p>Proletarian Factions Establish Tacit Understanding with Each Other</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 18th - Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who returned to Tokyo yesterday morning from canvassing in the Kansai region, is hoarse from speaking too much in various places, making it extremely difficult to speak. He said to reporters in his hoarse voice, "What I have seen and heard is only a part of the Kansai region and the Tokaido region. The popularity of the Minseito Party in these places is truly remarkable. Each speech was filled to capacity, and some people even stood outside the house. My throat swelled and hurt because of this. The election results cannot be known until the final announcement. However, based on what I have seen, the Minseito Party can absolutely guarantee more than 240 seats if the trend continues. But we should not be too optimistic. The competition is reaching its peak. We are also determined to devote all our efforts and continue to fight. Violation incidents have occurred successively due to the intensification of the election battle in various places, which is regrettable for the political world. However, the number of violators is superficially higher for the Minseito Party than for the Seiyukai Party because a candidate and forty of his athletes in Saitama Prefecture were all indicted, so the actual number of cases is lower for the Minseito Party. In short, there are only three days left, and each faction will use all means to win. The government is determined to severely crack down on the Seiyukai Party's supervisors, Monday members' exposure of the Party's candidates' violations, and declarations of unfair crackdowns. As I see it, the local police are holding a strict and fair attitude. The ballots will be counted on the 23rd and all completed. The provisional parliament will be convened around mid-April. In short, this is a decisive battle with everything on the line. For the sake of obtaining 240 seats, it is worthwhile even if I only hurt my throat. I will gather even more courage and continue to fight until I win the final victory."</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 18th - The proletarian factions, which seemingly refused to yield to each other, have established a tacit compromise with each other due to the progress of the election battle. In districts where there are no candidates from their own party, they will definitely vote for candidates from other proletarian parties. It is clear that the number of proletarian party members will definitely increase compared to the previous time as a result of the ballot count. The oratorical battle of Ikuo Oyama is gradually moving the masses with his eloquence. The situation for Dr. Hajime Kawakami in Kyoto is also gradually becoming more favorable.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Five-Year Industrial Plan</h3>
<p>Replaces Lenin's New Economic Policy</p>
<p>Passed by the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - According to Moscow sources, the Soviet Russian Central Executive Committee passed a bill to implement Stalin's five-year industrial plan to replace Lenin's new economic policy. According to this bill, wealthy farmers in areas where the public ownership system has been established must be expelled, and their industries must be confiscated. The local Soviet Party Committee may decide who should be expelled and who should stay. However, those who stay must live outside the public agricultural area, and those who are expelled will be sent to areas with scarce labor or no inhabitants. Farmers in areas where the public ownership system has not yet been established are not allowed to sell, donate, lease, or distribute their industries. Violators will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>New Political Party to Appear in the UK</h3>
<p>Named Unified Empire Party</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Sir Beaverbrook, the owner of a famous newspaper, has issued a declaration to those who advocate a free trade policy within the Empire, saying that a new political party, called the Unified Empire Party, has been organized with 200,000 male and female initiators.</p>
<h3>German Defense Minister's Request for Warship Construction Funds Rejected</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 18th - The German cabinet meeting dispersed only this morning. The Defense Minister's request to include funds in the budget for the construction of a second 10,000-ton cruiser, similar to the "pocket battleship," was ultimately rejected by a majority of cabinet members.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Leaves Independent Labor Party</h3>
<p>Because He Dislikes Its Leftward Leaning</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - British Prime Minister MacDonald has severed ties with the Independent Labor Party because there are many left-wing members in the party, and their attitude of rebellion against the Labor Party government is increasing. It was heard today that the party members in the south held a meeting in London at the end of the week and passed a resolution congratulating Maxton et al. for opposing the government's unemployment insurance bill.</p>
<h3>Fujita Kenichi, Japanese Medal-Selling Case, Imprisoned Again</h3>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th - Fujita Kenichi, the President of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who was being prosecuted in the medal-selling bribery case and released on bail, received a summons order from the Tokyo District Court on the morning of the 17th. At 9:00 PM, he was imprisoned again in Ichigaya Prison on charges of destroying evidence.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Missing White Russian General</h3>
<p>Startling Developments Soon</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th - It was heard today that the French police have learned that the abductor of the Russian General Kutepov three weeks ago was actually a Soviet Russian secret agent. Perhaps within the next forty-eight hours, there will be startling developments. It was heard that Prime Minister Tardieu has expressed his intention that if the Chamber of Deputies wants to sever ties with Russia, he is prepared to break off diplomatic relations with Russia. According to the French police's speculation, General Kutepov was dragged into a car by two people and one person disguised as a policeman and then taken to Normandy, where he was transferred to a suspiciously acting ship flying the Russian flag outside the port of Fécamp. If this is true, then General Kutepov has no hope of survival.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Receives Good Reviews in the U.S.</h3>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 17th - After Mei Lanfang revealed his appearance in Washington, he performed on stage in New York again last night. All of New York's drama critics and newspaper reporters attended. Although there was a language barrier, the audience was extremely satisfied and praised him highly. Mei first performed short, humorous dramas. The scenery and costumes were all brought from China. It is said that he will try to perform full-length dramas later.</p>
<p>Telegram</p>
<p>Telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee</p>
<p>To: All Newspapers, Transmitted to All Party, Government, and Military Organs Nationwide, Greetings. Recently, I read in the newspapers that Yan Xishan, the Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, whose oath to the Central Government is not yet dry, suddenly sent a telegram to Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of our revolution, expressing sentiments of courtesy and yielding, and agreeing to step down. After reading this, I was deeply shocked. Since Comrade Chiang Kai-shek led the army to complete the Northern Expedition, the period of political tutelage began, demobilization was implemented, and the unification of the country was achieved. The independence of the nation is about to be realized, and compatriots at home and abroad are all celebrating. Unfortunately, since last spring, the remnants of warlords and traitors within the party have colluded with each other, and disturbances have arisen one after another. Fortunately, Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, receiving the important mandate of the Party and the country, has shown great fearless spirit and gradually pacified them. However, at this time, when the reactionary forces have not been completely eliminated, and the principles have not been realized, we rely on Comrade Chiang Kai-shek to lead the entire world, continue to struggle, and complete the will of the late Premier, bringing China into a realm of freedom and equality. It is absurd that the aforementioned Yan Xishan, who received an important mandate from the Central Government, misunderstood his authority and confused the news. His persuasion for Comrade Chiang to personally step down is tantamount to completely ruining the revolutionary cause, causing the Chinese nation to fall into an abyss of eternal doom. Reciting Comrade Chiang's remarks to reporters, the meaning of the revolution, the analysis of authority, is detailed and thorough. His firm revolutionary attitude and great personality are admirable. Our committee mourns the difficulty of creation, and laments the unfinished national crisis. In addition to telegraphing Comrade Yan Xishan for questioning, we pledge to lead all comrades and people in the province to wholeheartedly support Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of our revolution. We hope that all sectors of the country will advocate this unanimously, in order to curb heresies and secure the Party and the country. In haste, we rush to inform you, with utmost anticipation. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee of the Kuomintang of China kowtows.</p>

<h3>Promulgation of Regulations for Inspectors by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the Commissioner's Offices for Foreign Affairs in various provinces last year, all local foreign affairs matters in the provinces have been handled by the provincial and county governments or municipal governments.

<h3>Central Propaganda Department to Issue Proclamation to the People</h3>
<p>Since Yan Xishan of Shanxi issued a telegram denouncing the central government, the Central Propaganda Department has drafted a proclamation to the people, which will be issued soon. The main points are as follows: (1) To restore social vitality, there must be peace. To establish national strength, there must be unification. Peaceful unification is a fundamental policy determined by the central government based on the actual needs of the people. Those who vigorously implement this policy are friends of the people, and those who violate this policy are enemies of the people. (2) Feudal forces are entrenched between the central government and the people, exploiting the local areas while undermining the central government. To break this entrenched situation between the central government and the people, there must be genuine peaceful unification. Now, the remaining feudal forces, seeing that the policy of peaceful unification is unfavorable to their habit of seizing territory and exploiting the people, have repeatedly resisted and resorted to rebellion. In order to implement the policy of peaceful unification that is consistent with the interests of the nation and the people, the central government sincerely advises those who have hidden but not yet expressed rebellion; this is called stopping rebellion. For those who have already rebelled and cannot be dissuaded, they will be suppressed; this is called suppressing rebellion. At the same time, the central government constantly hopes that the remaining feudal forces, which have repeatedly created rebellions, will reform and eliminate feudal thinking invisibly; this is called eliminating rebellion. (3) Only those who uphold Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the historical mission of the party are qualified to speak of eliminating rebellion. Only those who consistently obey the orders of the party and the nation are qualified to speak of suppressing rebellion. Only those who deeply understand the suffering of the people and the urgency of national crisis and sincerely work together for construction are qualified to speak of stopping rebellion. Those who outwardly show benevolence but inwardly practice treachery are not qualified to speak of this. (4) To concentrate the thoughts and plans for saving the nation under one system, there must be ideology. To concentrate citizens who share this thought and plan under one organization, there must be a party. To use the power of the party to implement ideology, there must be political tutelage. Only those who uphold the ideology created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and have the deep history of the party and are consistently devoted can have opinions about the party's ideology. Those who are fickle and unfaithful are not worthy of having the party's ideology, and their opinions are not enough to win the trust of the people. (5) Now is the time for soldiers to thoroughly awaken and realize that soldiers should no longer use others to plot feudalism or be used by others as tools for feudalism. Their awakening can not only redeem themselves but also eliminate the resurgence of other feudal evil forces. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong's Division Moves to Suxian</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The 2nd Division of the 1st Army of the 2nd Route Army, led by Gu Zhutong, arrived in Bengbu on the 25th of last month to take over the defense and protect the railway. However, Gu was ordered yesterday to lead the army personnel from Bengbu to Xu first, to control the troops. The 2nd Division, which was directly under his command in Bengbu, was ordered to move to southern Suzhou. After receiving the order, the division immediately ordered the troops to depart. However, due to the lack of locomotives on the Jinpu Railway, transportation was inconvenient, so the troops were ordered to set off on foot. Zhao Qianghua's 8th Regiment and Wang Jingjiu's 9th Regiment of the 4th Brigade of the division marched north early this morning (the 16th). The directly subordinate troops and Hou Kesheng's 7th Regiment and Zheng Dongguo's 10th Regiment of Bai Tianmin's 6th Brigade are scheduled to depart tomorrow. The division headquarters and the special service battalion are scheduled to depart on the 18th and complete the departure before the 19th. Wang Zhonglian's 11th Regiment and Li Jingnan's 12th Regiment of the 6th Brigade will remain stationed in Bengbu. It is reported that Wang Jun's 7th Division and Yang Shengzhi's 44th Division are coming from Dangshan to be stationed. The former unit is about to arrive in Bengbu. Currently stationed in Bengbu is also the 12th Regiment of Zhang Lisheng's 2nd Cavalry Division. Ge Wucheng's 3rd Brigade of the division is currently stationed in Linhuai, and Zhang Shutian's 4th Brigade is currently stationed in the area of Guzhen and southern Suzhou. (February 16)</p>
<h3>Latest Battle News on the Guangdong-Guangxi Border</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the focus of military operations in Guangxi has shifted to the southern part of the Guangdong-Guangxi border. Zhu Shaoliang's 6th Route Army is able to withdraw all of its forces at this time to defend between Hexian and Wuzhou in order to assist the 8th Route Army in pursuing the enemy in southern Guangxi since the two Xiang Army units led by Liu Jianxu and Chen Guangzhong have already arrived in Guilin and Lingchuan, and the attack on Liuzhou can be taken over by the Xiang Army. Therefore, from the 10th to the 12th, Tan Daoyuan's and Mao Bingwen's two divisions of the 6th Route Army, and Xu Kexiang's brigade, have successively departed from Pingxian and headed towards the area of Babu, Hexian, and Xindu. The headquarters of the 6th Route Army also set up in Hexian, led by Zhu, on the 11th. Zhu will go to Wuzhou within days to discuss important matters with Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the 8th Route Army. Once the discussions are completed, Mao's division and Xu's brigade will be transferred to the left wing to assist the 8th Route Army in pursuing the enemy of Xun-Gui. As for the left wing, there have been fierce battles near Rongxian in recent days. Because Zhang Guijiun's troops have been using Beiliu, Yulin, Guixian, and Rongxian on the Guangdong-Guangxi border as their base, the 8th Route Army yesterday dispatched Cai Tingkai's 60th Division and Jiang Guangnai's 61st Division from Anxi to raid Rongxian, intending to break through Beiliu and Yulin to cut off Zhang's army's path.</p>
<p>On the 10th, Cai, Jiang, and a part of Xiang Hanping's division successively arrived at Yangmeiwei and Ziliangwei near Rongxian and engaged in fierce battles with Xu's and Deng's troops. According to a telegram from the front on the 12th, "Deng Longguang's and Xu Zongwu's rebel troops, numbering over 4,000, were ambushed near Rongxian by our Jiang, Cai, and Xiang troops and disarmed. The 8th Route Army's headquarters will set off for the front immediately."

<p>Kidnapping Case Two Cases in One Night: At the home of Cao Genrong in Caojiawan outside the east gate of the county, eight or nine fierce bandits suddenly came at midnight the day before yesterday, broke into the door with weapons in hand, and kidnapped Genrong. Jin Xinyuan and Jin Xinqi, two farmers in Chentajing, were also robbed that night and kidnapped together, and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Police Misunderstanding Almost Led to Conflict: In Zhujiajiao Town, Qingpu, Wang Jinxiang, a thief, stole clothes from Jiang Xiaofeng's house in Xihejiagang and was caught and sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. At the time, several patrol boats of the second detachment of the third team of the first district, led by Li Zhigui, came from Taizhou to suppress bandits. They mistakenly believed that the thief was a police officer of the detachment. At about 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, they went to the Public Security Bureau with more than a dozen police officers from the same detachment to demand his release. The bureau refused to release him because the stolen goods were present. Then, more than forty officers of the detachment arrived, ready to storm the bureau. People were panicked, and the order east of Guanyin Bridge was disrupted. The merchants went on strike one after another. At the time, Li Zhigui, the detachment leader, was tasting tea at the club and rushed to stop the incident upon hearing the news. He also summoned the thief Wang Jinxiang, who was indeed not a patrol officer of the detachment. The matter was settled only after strenuous mediation.</p>
<p>Infatuated with Lust, Goes Mad and Stabs His Own Mother: A certain Gu in Qingpu, over twenty years old, likes women.

The matter was about to be settled, but his father, Gu Yunru, did not agree, leading him to become infatuated. The day before yesterday, he drank at home, took off his clothes, and went into a frenzy. His mother, as the only son, spoiled him very much and comforted him in every way. Unexpectedly, Gu took a sharp knife and stabbed his mother's face. Fortunately, his mother was quick-witted and dodged to the side, but her right shoulder was stabbed. She shouted for help, alarming the neighbors who gathered and captured him. His father, fearing that he would cause a major disaster, imprisoned his son in a room. It is said that Gu has quite a bit of property and only has this one son, but he has no legitimate profession.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Armed Wedding – Groom Serves Penance:  It occurred in the east street of Anting Town, a county under your jurisdiction, where Shen Zai Zhi, the owner of Tongxing Rice Mill, had betrothed his daughter Da Juan to a son of a Zhu family in Qingpu some years ago. Yesterday (the 16th) was the wedding date. The Zhu family prepared a sedan to receive the bride and hired two public security team members and two members of the defense corps from that county, armed with guns for protection. The decorated sedan arrived in the town at 2 PM. Negotiations over the six wedding rituals and reward took a long time. Unexpectedly, the team members, anxious to return as night was falling, did not wait for the host's instructions and carried the decorated sedan themselves to the bride's residence, forcing the bride to board the sedan. Shen believed that such a rushed manner was inappropriate for such an important wedding ceremony and questioned them slightly. The team members responded with loud insults. The matchmaker, Zhou Jiesan, tried to dissuade them but failed, and the argument escalated into a deadlock. In anger, Shen Zai Zhi declared that unless the team members served penance on the spot, he would not allow his daughter to marry. After the relentless mediation of both families and friends, the groom was ordered to enter the hall and plead guilty to his in-laws to prevent the sedan from returning empty.</p>
<p>Cross-Border Arrest Case Concludes: Regarding the cross-border arrest case in Chen Dian Luoyang Township, the lost firearms and other items were recovered after three and a half days of effort by Song Suchen, the head of the Public Security First Branch, together with local gentry Qian Lugang and Yang Pingzhi, and consisted of one套筒 rifle, two rows of bullets, two Browning pistols, one White-Boblin pistol, five bullets, and one magazine, which have been submitted to the county government. County Magistrate Chen, based on the investigation reports from various parties, concluded that the misunderstanding arose because patrol officer Cheng Yunkun and others were not wearing their official hats, and their uniforms were incomplete. Furthermore, Director Yang's actions of crossing the border to forcefully break down doors and make arrests without discrimination were also inappropriate.  The verified facts obtained from the investigation, along with the recovered weapons, were prepared as a document and entrusted to Zhu Shou, the director of the Public Security Bureau, who carried them to the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau on the 17th, and also brought back the arrested Chen Arong, Qian Lianfang, Feng Atong, Chen Chunsheng, Qian Xiong Cai, Qian Huiquan, and fifteen others, arriving in the city in the afternoon and turning them over to the judicial authorities for handling.</p>

<p>Han Jinshi Case to be Re-Examined Today: The local court opened a hearing on the 17th to examine the suspicious death of Han Jinshi.  For the sake of caution, the forensic officer handling the case, Li Baokun, requested the court to continue the autopsy.

The circumstances of the arrest have been reported in this newspaper.

<p>Ministry of Education Advocates No Classical Chinese Textbooks for Elementary Schools: The General Affairs Department has issued a circular to the country to comply with the recent review of textbooks by the Compilation and Review Department. During the era of the University Council, there were a few approved Classical Chinese textbooks for elementary schools. Now that it is absolutely advocated that elementary schools should not use Classical Chinese textbooks, the Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education has issued a circular to abolish the previously approved Classical Chinese textbooks for elementary schools during the era of the University Council. Elementary schools will uniformly adopt vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is deemed inappropriate for elementary school graduates who have not used Classical Chinese to enter junior high school and then use Classical Chinese textbooks. The Ministry of Education has also issued a circular stating that the compilation of junior high school textbooks should also adopt more vernacular Chinese.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Actively Compiles Thousand-Character Primer</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, following a resolution by the Central Executive Committee, is tasked with compiling a Thousand-Character Primer on the Three Principles of the People, to be completed by the end of June. The Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education is actively proceeding, with Vice-Minister Liu Dabai appointing compilers Zhao Tingwei and Jiang Xiling to plan the project comprehensively. The first step is to select the thousand characters, which is the most difficult task. It must consider party knowledge, popular readings, and social practicality. Therefore, the selection should be precise and thorough. Each compiler is currently engaged in the selection of characters. The second step is to select materials, which also requires careful consideration. The third step is to compile, which will be easier to begin once the characters and materials are available. The Ministry of Education plans to appoint a specialist to handle it. The Compilation and Review Department of the Ministry of Education will either divide the work or collaborate to complete the task as soon as possible, not exceeding the central deadline.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Closure of Four Universities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Orders Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to Handle</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education recently ordered the Shanghai Special Municipality Bureau of Education to investigate and report on universities such as Guangming and Huaguo for failing to comply with university regulations. The Ministry of Education received the bureau's report yesterday, which stated that Guangming, Huaguo, Xinmin Universities, and the College of Arts and Law were not operating in accordance with regulations and that their content was extremely corrupt and simple. There have also been similar reports from various parties. The Ministry of Education believes that since this is the reality, it should be stopped to avoid misleading young people and issued a special order to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to, with the support of the municipal government, order the closure of the universities and colleges immediately.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee on Education Program to Convene</h3>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Education Program Compilation Committee of the Ministry of Education will reconvene at the Ministry of Education on the 21st (Friday).

It is reported that all unapproved education programs, such as social education, Mongolian-Tibetan education, higher education, party ideology education, and overseas Chinese education, will be discussed at this meeting.</p>
<h3>Provisional Approval for Increased Supplementary Education Land Tax in Jiangsu Due to Insufficient Ratio</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department yesterday issued an order to the magistrates of 61 counties and the directors of the education bureaus, stating: For the information of the provincial governor, it is noted that the supplementary education land tax in various counties, previously stipulated for areas implementing universal education, should be levied starting from eight fen per mu, and may be increased up to one jiao and six fen. Later, a resolution by the Provincial Government Committee stipulated that the taxes of various counties should not exceed one percent of the land value. The supplementary education land tax in various counties is also subject to this restriction. Therefore, although the requests from various counties this year to increase the land tax have been forwarded to the Finance Department for review, the responses received have either stated that the total amount of taxes has already exceeded the limit and cannot be increased further, or that the increase should be considered after the tax-to-land value ratio tables from each county are submitted. As a result, the original plans of various counties to gradually increase funding and expand educational initiatives have been halted midway. At this critical juncture when political tutelage has just begun and the advancement of universal education is extremely important, the expansion of initiatives necessitates the addition of funding. After investigating the surcharges and taxes levied by the counties, those that have already reached the full amount within the prescribed range cannot request an increase in land tax for any initiative. However, for supplementary education land taxes that have been prescribed for gradual increases and have not exceeded the one percent limit of land value, if the needs have been verified by this department as genuine, the increase should be approved immediately. It was requested that the Provincial Government review the old cases and clearly stipulate that, regarding the requests from certain counties to increase the supplementary education land tax, if it has been verified and is within the one percent limit of land value, and the needs have been verified by this department as genuine, it should be approved according to the case. Following the issuance of Instruction No. 700, it was stated: "The case has been reviewed and approved by the 161st meeting of the Provincial Committee and ordered to be sent to the Finance Department." In addition to recording the case and distributing it, you are hereby notified of this order. Enclosed is a copy of the original report for your information.</p>
<h3>Order from Zhejiang Provincial Government Prohibiting Teachers and Staff from Concurrently Handling Land Reporting</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government yesterday issued an order to the Education Department stating: "It has been approved that the Secretariat Document No. 1095 from the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party stated that the representative assembly of Yuyao County requested that teachers and staff at all levels of schools be prohibited from concurrently handling land reporting cases, please investigate and reply." It has been approved, it has been found that the points raised in the original report are not without merit. In addition to replying by letter, the original report is urgently copied and forwarded to your department for verification and handling, please reply accordingly. Enclosed is one copy of the original report. "Report for request, since the commencement of land reporting in this province, many teachers in various places have concurrently served in this capacity. Taking only our county as an example, teachers and staff in rural schools who concurrently handle land reporting account for approximately sixty to seventy percent. The disadvantages are as follows: (1) Neglect of teaching duties: Some teachers, after concurrently handling land reporting, do not attend classes due to being out surveying and mapping; some take half-day or intermittent days off; some start winter vacation early. The neglect of teaching duties is self-evident. (2) Arouse suspicion in society towards schools: Society is already suspicious of land reporting. If teachers and staff are responsible for promotion, that is acceptable. However, many teachers believe there is profit to be made and overstep their bounds, which is enough to arouse suspicion in society, claiming that schools are money-making machines and losing their faith. (3) Schools are like government offices: It is often heard that teachers, due to handling land reporting, dispatch police to arrest local villagers indiscriminately. Schools are like government offices, and teachers act like officials. Although this is a matter of individual character, its impact on education is not insignificant. In summary, it is clear that teachers and staff should not concurrently handle land reporting. However, local administrative officials only seek to complete the task as soon as possible in order to claim credit, without considering the bankruptcy of education. Such a situation is not desirable. Therefore, the third meeting of the subordinate association resolved to request the Provincial Executive Committee to forward a letter to the Education Department, ordering all levels of school teachers and staff not to concurrently handle land reporting in order to maintain education."

<h3>Career Guidance Institute Advises Young Workers</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the Shanghai Career Guidance Institute has seen a significant increase in the number of young workers from various industries registering with the institute to request job introductions. The institute has therefore issued a letter to advise young workers, stating in brief: "In the past month, many young people serving in industry and commerce have left their jobs and become unemployed. The reasons are not singular, but the most fundamental causes are: first, excessive expectations and intolerance of hardship; second, dislike of boredom and unwillingness to be dedicated and enjoy their work; and third, excessive pursuit of external activities and failure to take responsibility. Due to these three factors, they lack interest in their work and leaders find it difficult to trust them, resulting in frequent job terminations. Only after losing their jobs do they feel the pain of unemployment and the difficulty of finding work. The comrades who come to the institute every day express similar sentiments. Therefore, it is better to be prudent before having a job than to be hesitant after losing one. If you constantly think of the hardship of unemployment while employed, you will surely be diligent in your work and loyal to your profession. You will gain endless interest for yourself and earn special trust from your leaders. It all depends on how hard you work in your daily service. The 'Weekly Living' and the 'Federation of Trade Unions Journal,' as well as all books on youth self-cultivation, can help you improve. In your spare time, you should also take heed of this sincere advice. In addition, the institute has been entrusted by a certain organization to find a female Chinese typist and a university graduate proficient in English to teach. They are currently seeking suitable candidates."</p>
<h3>Textile Manufacturers Organize the Chinese Textile Research Association</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that the technology of cotton spinning mills in our country is still nascent. Moreover, technical personnel in management and engineering have rarely gathered together to work on their own. Therefore, there are even fewer opportunities for research and improvement. It is heard that various textile manufacturers, aware of this situation, have initiated the establishment of the Chinese Textile Research Association, jointly initiated by 35 people including Wang Xueli, Zhu Xianfang, Tao Zhengsheng, Huang Bingkui, Lu Fuzhou, Lu Shaoyun, Chen Diesheng, Ren Liqing, and Xiao Songli. The association aims to establish a long-term goal for China's textile industry and adopt prudent measures to promote its development as its mission. Its subsidiary objectives are to research textile academics and communicate information. Currently, the draft charter is being solicited from textile manufacturers nationwide for joint participation. It is estimated that the association can be formally established in two months. The preparatory office is located at the United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills. Any comrades in the textile industry who are interested in participating can contact Mr. Qian at the association directly.</p>
<h3>Pioneering the Establishment of a Private Flying School</h3>
<p>Mr. Renyuan, the second son of Bank of Communications President Wang, who is studying in Japan, is currently working hard to study aviation. He will be graduating from the Mikuni Aviation School in Tachikawa, Tokyo in the next few months. After returning to China, he is determined to dedicate himself to civil aviation and plans to establish a private flying school. He has already obtained the approval of President Wang, who has initially allocated 100,000 yuan to start the school. If the results are good, there will be unlimited development. He has submitted a request to the government for assistance and approval. However, the location has not yet been decided, and they are considering either using the Hongqiao Flying Field or purchasing their own flying field. In addition to himself, he will hire two instructors and one mechanic. In the first phase, they will enroll 50 students. After selecting the location, they will build a hangar that can accommodate more than ten aircraft, as well as three buildings for classrooms, offices, and dormitories. As for the aircraft, they will initially purchase five trainer aircraft.</p>
<h3>Zeng Yangfu to Serve as Acting President of Construction University</h3>
<p>Construction University was established not long ago, and it already has over 600 students. Last year, there was a student protest due to the poor performance of the staff. Subsequently, the board of directors resolved to appoint Huang Ling霜 as vice president. As reported in the newspapers previously, the president of the university, Zhang Jingjiang, is still unable to oversee the university's affairs due to his busy political duties. Therefore, he has entrusted Zeng Yangfu, the vice chairman of the Construction Committee of the Central Committee, to serve as acting president. The teachers and students of Construction University have telegraphed Mr. Zeng, urging him to take office as soon as possible and inspect the university.</p>

President Liu delivered a welcoming speech. Mr. Li then stood up to speak, saying, "It has been two and a half years since I left the country. I often think of my old friends and all the students of the university. I am very happy to be back and to be able to gather with you all. When I arrived in the United States in 1927, the Nanjing Incident occurred and the Jinan Massacre followed. I respected that friendly nations would understand. Now, the US Ambassador to China, Mr. Johnson, has expressed his sympathy and offered assistance. In terms of diplomacy, it is not easy. Later, I was ordered to be the minister to Mexico. The government and the people of that country were all gentle and approachable, without arrogance or prejudice, and with no deep-seated discrimination. The climate is spring-like all year round. I served there for two years and fortunately avoided any missteps. I felt quite at ease living there. Now, I have been recalled to China and see that the university is becoming more and more vibrant. I sincerely hope that under the guidance of the capable president, you will all work hard in your studies and strive to apply what you have learned. Then, the glory of our university will be the brilliance of China, and your future will be unlimited." After that, Mrs. Li and alumnus Zeng Youhao (President of the Anhui Higher Court) also delivered speeches in succession. Finally, President Liu expressed his gratitude and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>My Reflections After This Zonal Competition (Part Two) Li Huitang</h3>
<p>In the second game, the penalty kick we conceded was for a foul committed outside the eighteen-yard area, but their forward took the opportunity to roll inside. What is most incomprehensible is that he publicly expelled both Jia Qiu Zhen and Er You from the field for unknown reasons. Perhaps they deserved it, but a certain central defender from South China, who was even more aggressive than them, and a certain forward who kicked Zhou Shou's ribs almost to breaking, were able to remain unscathed. That is something I cannot understand.</p>
<p>What I am most dissatisfied with is that at the zonal banquet, Mr. Ye actually used English in front of foreigners in a self-aggrandizing way to humiliate us. What was his intention? Where was his character? I really cannot understand. The purpose of a banquet is to eliminate barriers and increase goodwill, especially since we were the honored guests at that banquet. Mr. Ye is confident in his intelligence, but he does not even understand this obvious etiquette, which is both strange and bizarre. Mr. Ye said that the two players from the East China team who were expelled by me should pay more attention to their spirit in the future. He advised the captain of East China to read more rules and urged his teammates to work on their character. These few sentences of his in English, which were sarcastic and mocking, were really not what humans should say. I was forced to stand up and argue. I said that I am extremely sorry for the occurrence of this unfortunate event. Whether they deserved to be expelled or not, I do not care. However, we have played in Shanghai for many years and have never been penalized by the general association. We are confident that we pay great attention to sportsmanship and have very high achievements. As for the layer of asking me to read more rules, I am a member of the Shanghai Referees Association. Unless there are differences between Hong Kong and Shanghai football rules, I am afraid I do not need to read them again. Mr. Ye, English is not something that can be spoken everywhere. I hope you will be more careful in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to the above facts about the referees, there are also several linesmen that I despise very much. I dare say that except for Mr. Chen Su, the rest of the people who have served as linesmen are partial to one side. They are willing to exchange their character for their goals. These friends can only be asked to sit on the sidelines to cheer for their team, but they cannot be given the impartial position of linesman.</p>
<p>In the end, I feel that the result of this zonal competition is very satisfactory. Because in terms of emotional connection, we do have a deeper sense of friendship. In terms of studying art, we have also learned a little about the advantages. In terms of sightseeing, we have also enjoyed the scenery of Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou. In terms of trophies, although we failed, we have already had two sessions of achievements on that cup. In the future, you and I can compete for it, which can increase interest. In terms of promoting the football skills of the East China region, our close contact and our transmission of the wonderful attacking and defending techniques have indeed left a deep impression on the minds of the people in the south.</p>
<p>Therefore, as I conclude, I hope that future zonal competitions can surpass the past in terms of results, so that the buds of today can become the brilliant fruits of tomorrow. (The End)</p>

<h3>Wang Leping Assassinated</h3>
<p>Occurred at 11:00 PM Last Night</p>
<p>Wang Dies in Residence, Three Wounded, Two Injured</p>
<p>Another Corpse Found by Roadside</p>
<p>French Consul Personally Investigates</p>
<p>Wang Leping, a Shandong native, resided in Shanghai, renting a house along the road at No. 314 Avenue Messimy in the Avenue Joffre district as a place for meetings and handling affairs. At 11:30 PM last night (18th), while Wang was on the second floor of his residence, seven assailants suddenly arrived, each carrying a Mauser pistol. They broke into Wang's residence, went upstairs, and immediately attacked with weapons. Wang, caught off guard, was shot and killed. At that time, his friends Zhao Lin and Tang Dejian were also in the room. They were also hit in vital areas. Tang Dejian died instantly, while Zhao Lin was seriously injured. After the assailants went downstairs, they also shot and killed Wang's male servant, Kang Ruizhai, downstairs. Wang's doorman was also seriously injured. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in different directions. Upon hearing the news, our reporter immediately drove to the scene to investigate. It was already 1:00 AM this morning. French and Chinese detectives from the French police station were at the scene investigating. They took flash photographs inside the house. The French Consul General, upon learning of the incident, also personally came to the scene to investigate. About one hundred yards south of No. 314, a person was also found shot to death by the roadside, leaning against a roadside utility pole. He had a bullet wound in his chest, and the bloodstains were obvious. There was also accumulated blood on the road. His face was pale, which was appalling. It is said that this person's death may be a separate case and may not be related to Wang's case. Zhao Lin, who was injured, and the doorman have been sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The bodies of Wang Leping, Tang Dejian, and Kang Ruizhai, as well as the corpse by the roadside, will be transported to Tongren Fuyuan Hall this morning (19th) for autopsy.</p>
<h3>Li Jinlun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Disembarking, He Immediately Attends a Grand Welcome Reception in Shanghai</p>
<p>After a Brief Rest, He Will Proceed to Beijing to Report</p>
<p>Li Jinlun, our country's envoy to Mexico and newly appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Mexico in the early part of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] to assume his post as envoy. On December 8th of last year, he received an order from the National Government to leave Mexico and return to China. Affairs at the embassy are temporarily being handled by Secretary Li Zhao. When Mr. Li went to the United States, he made a stopover in Washington to confer with Wu Chaoshu, our country's envoy to the United States, about all matters, and toured famous scenic spots in various places. At the end of January of this year, he finally embarked on the President Johnson from San Francisco to come to Shanghai. Accompanying him were his wife and Secretary Li Zixiu, etc. When the ship passed Osaka and Kobe in Japan, Mr. Li, to avoid social engagements, did not stay, and few outsiders knew about it. He left Japan on the 16th and entered the port at six o'clock yesterday morning, docking at the Dalae Wharf in Bailianjing at seven o'clock and arriving at the new customs wharf at eight thirty. Chen Shiguang, Director of the External Affairs Office, Section Chief Liu Yunfang, Yu Peijun, a member of the External Affairs Office, Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University, and Mr. Li's relatives and friends all went to the wharf to welcome him. Mr. Li is over fifty years old, with a rather refined appearance, graying hair, and vigorous spirit. After landing, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Then, Liu Zhanen invited Mr. and Mrs. Li to take Chen Shiguang's car to Shanghai University to attend a welcome reception hosted by the faculty and students of Shanghai University, as Mr. Li was the former Vice President of the university. In the afternoon, they drove to the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road and stayed in room 413. Mr. Li, due to fatigue from the ship, declined all social engagements and plans to rest in Shanghai for a few days before going to Beijing to report to the National Government on his experiences in Mexico and take up his new post on a set date.</p>
<h3>Danish Crown Prince to Tour China</h3>
<p>Danish Consul Negotiates Reception Matters Yesterday</p>
<p>The Danish Consul-General, De Lasson, announced that the Danish Crown Prince and his wife will tour China in early next month. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Chen Shiguang to discuss reception matters. Also, the Dutch Consul, Daniel, met with Chen Shiguang yesterday afternoon for some negotiations.</p>
<h3>Minister Kong's Memorandum on the Value of Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>Addressed to the National Tariff Commission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after convening three joint meetings of important Chinese and foreign merchants, has learned that Minister Kong Xiangxi, in order to contribute his opinions, has specially compiled and mailed the various opinions obtained from the three joint meetings of the office to the National Tariff Commission, which is currently holding a meeting in Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Commodity Types for Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Tariff</h3>
<p>Mostly Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that most of the issues in the Sino-Japanese tariff negotiations have been resolved. Only the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff goods are still under discussion. According to news from the Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, the types of commodities for the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff have been largely agreed upon. It is said that the Japanese side has proposed about one hundred types, including cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which are all reprocessed industrial products and are included under the reciprocal tariff. On the Chinese side, the reciprocal tariff products imported to Japan are mostly raw materials, and their number is not as many as those of Japan.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Agrees to Recovering Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Wuchen News Agency reports that since the order to abolish consular jurisdiction was issued, the opinions of various countries expressing sympathy with China have been quite numerous. The British weekly "New Statesman," under the title "New Policy in China," discussed the above-mentioned order and speculated on the changing status of Shanghai. It believes that the former Mixed Court was originally a purely Chinese judicial organ. After the Chinese Revolution in 1911, foreign forces began to intervene, but this was without any treaty basis. Later, it was changed to a Provisional Court. Recently, the Nanjing government has taken another step to restore this court to a purely Chinese judicial organ, which is very appropriate. It also stated that Shanghai is currently divided into three areas, namely (1) the International Settlement, (2) the French Concession, and (3) the old Chinese territory and Pudong, as well as the newly developed area in western Shanghai, each with its own affiliations, which is very inconvenient. Furthermore, in one corner of Shanghai, the laws of China and the other sixteen treaty countries are used simultaneously. Since trials adopt the principle of the defendant's nationality, unexpected disputes are bound to occur in complex commercial cases, such as when the defendant's nationality is in more than one country. Therefore, many enlightened people advocate merging the three areas of Shanghai into one and placing it under one municipal government, abolishing consular jurisdiction, and applying Chinese law to try all cases. Finally, the newspaper stated that if the Chinese side takes any action on the above issue, it is hoped that the countries concerned will send legal experts to China to investigate and properly discuss the matter, and not resort to intimidation with warships and troops.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce for Consolidation Urges Peace to Save the Country</h3>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce for Consolidation telegraphed the Nanjing National Government Chairman Jiang and Taiyuan Deputy Commander Yan, stating, "Shanghai is the central hub of industry and commerce. Last year, all industries declined, and large factories went bankrupt one after another. Those who managed to maintain support were also heavily indebted and in imminent danger. Everyone believes that this year, with the end of military affairs, there will be a turnaround. Thereafter, they will work hard on construction, the national government will gradually get on the right track, and commercial difficulties may be alleviated. However, recently, news reported in the newspapers has inevitably caused the public to be filled with suspicion and warn each other in alarm. We believe that peace, unification, and saving China is the late Premier's legacy. In the wake of years of war, famine, and hardship, the people in the northwest have almost no means of livelihood, and the financial resources in the southeast are also on the verge of bankruptcy. It is particularly necessary to avoid war in order to reverse the great catastrophe. Your Excellency is the pillar of the party and the country. We implore you to adhere to the late Premier's teachings so that the newly established Divine Land will not repeat the turmoil, and to quell the seeds of suspicion and rumors among villains, and the people will have hope of escaping the fire and water and ascending to a safe place. We respectfully submit this telegram and await your reply. Respectfully, the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce Consolidation Committee."</p>
<h3>Christian Churches Call for Peace</h3>
<p>The National Christian Council of China recently received a telegram from Mr. Paratray of the London Church, requesting that it be relayed to church leaders across the country to unite and pray together on March 1st at 4:30 PM for the London Naval Disarmament Conference. At present, the international situation is changing rapidly, and world peace is in danger at any time. Looking back at our country, the flames of war in Guangdong and Guangxi have not yet been extinguished, and rumors in the northwest have risen again. The overall situation is precarious, and the storms are particularly severe. Therefore, we specially request church leaders in various places to respond to the London telegram and take this opportunity to pray for world peace, and at the same time earnestly appeal for domestic peace, hoping that our sincerity will move even metal and stone, and that the tragedy of internal strife can be avoided, so that those who benefit will not only be our fellow believers.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Central Committee member Wu Zhihui arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at around nine o'clock yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Seven Aircraft Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Of the sixty-four aircraft ordered by the Ministry of Military Affairs from the United States to be incorporated into the Central Aviation Team, more than twenty have already been transported in succession. Yesterday, another seven were shipped from New York on the American ship Johnson and were immediately unloaded at the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong. The Ministry of Military Affairs has entrusted the China Travel Service to handle the extraction and customs clearance procedures.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union's Opinion on the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau</h3>
<p>Believes There Is No Need to Establish It</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in imitation of the practices of various countries, intends to establish a separate General Bureau to manage postal savings and remittance services in order to promote development. Upon learning of this, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, considering the matter of great importance to social construction, resolved to appoint specialists to study it and widely solicited opinions from economic experts. As a result, the reasons declared by the authorities for establishing the bureau are very different, and many contradictions are pointed out. According to the union committee members, in the postal systems of European, American, and Japanese countries, the savings and remittance businesses were initially managed under the same bureau as other postal services. Later, as postal services developed, for the convenience of management, separate bureaus were established for savings and remittance. However, the authorities do not consider the national conditions and people's livelihood, and do not follow economic conditions and needs, recklessly engaging in extravagance, establishing empty specialized bureaus, and planning to compete with the achievements of other countries' decades of operation. This kind of inverted view of cause and effect is a big mistake. At a time when politics is unstable and people's livelihood is declining, if one wants to seek the development of savings and remittance, one should gradually reform on the existing foundation to achieve practical results. Otherwise, the indiscriminate establishment of parallel organs will waste the national treasury and shake the postal foundation, which is contrary to Chairman Jiang's original intention of reducing unnecessary organs to increase political efficiency. It is heard that the union has already compiled its research results and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for forwarding to the National Government for reconsideration and withdrawal of the order. (The original submission is very long)</p>
<h3>Far East Opium Investigation Team Comes to China</h3>
<p>Anti-Drug Association Advocates Non-Recognition</p>
<p>The Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations organized a Far East Opium Investigation Team, refusing to allow Chinese representatives to join the investigation, and the scope of the investigation is limited to the Far East, which is fundamentally unfair. Our country's attending representative, Minister Wang Jingqi, has raised objections. The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is even more dissatisfied with the organization of the team, and has repeatedly opposed it and planned countermeasures. The team arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday, they went to the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association to inquire about the association's views on the team's arrival in China. We hereby transcribe the association's views as follows: The association has previously issued a declaration, believing that the harm of opium and narcotic drugs is spread all over the world. Imperialist countries such as Britain, Japan, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden all take it as a tool for economic aggression and a vanguard of military aggression. Since guns and warships can only be used in times of war, opium and narcotics can be used at any time and anywhere, taking advantage of unequal treaties and consular jurisdiction to promote it without hindrance. As a result, not only economic benefits are obtained, but in fact, the country can be destroyed and the race can be exterminated, which is the most vicious policy and the most profound crime in the international community. Anyone with a little conscience is heartbroken and urgently thinks of ways to eliminate it and seek a lifeline for world humanity. Previously, various countries have repeatedly convened conferences to prohibit opium, and commonly agreed on conventions and mutually trusted each other. However, countries producing opium and narcotic drugs have no sincerity at all and deceive each other with diplomatic means, resulting in the spread of opium and an ever-increasing prevalence. Our country, which has always been contested by the great powers, has become a large market for drugs in the world, and the disaster is overwhelming and impossible to clean up. Thinking of this, we are extremely heartbroken. During the 13th year of the Republic of China, the League of Nations convened a large-scale anti-opium conference, hoping to combine the sincerity of various countries to jointly eliminate opium and narcotics. Our people, due to the advocacy of the anti-drug movement, believed in international support. However, representatives from countries such as Britain and Japan only sought the interests of their own opium merchants, disregarding humanity and being blinded by greed, resulting in our country's proposal to restrict the manufacture of narcotics not being passed, and blaming our country for producing too much opium, accusing it of being the culprit for destroying the world's opium prohibition, causing the meeting to end without results and disband. Recently, the Opium Advisory Committee, based on the suggestion of the British representative, organized the Far East Opium Investigation Team and sent members to our country and various countries in the Far East to investigate the opium situation. Although it was opposed by our country from top to bottom, the team still actively came. Examining its intention, it is not to seek evidence of the abandonment of our country's opium prohibition, as a basis for interfering in our country's internal affairs, but to expose our country's inferiority to the world, so that at next year's international anti-opium conference, our country will become the target of public criticism, so that the discussion of banning narcotics can be postponed indefinitely. Therefore, the area of its investigation is limited to the Far East, the scope of investigation is limited to opium, the candidates for investigation exclude our country's representatives, and the investigation expenses are paid from the League's public funds. What could be more unfair than this? This association is concerned about the country's reputation and hates the scourge of drugs. It believes that this investigation is inappropriate. If the League of Nations sincerely intends to eliminate the scourge of drugs in the world, it should adopt a fair and stable method, accommodate our country's opinions, and expand the investigation area to all countries in the world, not limited to the Far East. The scope of the investigation should include narcotics and not be limited to opium. The organization of the investigation team should have our country's representatives joining, so that things can be fair. The team actively came to China despite our country's opposition, so it can be known that its intentions are malicious and its actions are illegal. In addition to publishing the team's unfairness to the world and exposing the truth of foreign drug imports to harm China, this association deeply hopes that compatriots across the country will, on the one hand, urge the government to strictly enforce opium prohibition to avoid giving foreigners an excuse, and on the other hand, resist foreign drugs, expose their policies to harm China, and seek the public opinion of the world. The arrival of the investigation team in China will definitely not be recognized.</p>

<h3>Headquarters Allocates Second Phase of Ship Rental Arrears</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association yesterday sent a circular to shipping companies such as China Merchants, Sanbei, and others, stating, "I am writing to inform you that we have recently received a telegram from Director Qiu of the Transportation Department of the Headquarters, which states that the Shanghai Shipping Association is to forward to China Merchants, Sanbei, Longmao, Hefeng, Zhoushan, Yulong, Yuda, Daxing, Haichang, Yida, Zhidong, Beifang, Zhaoxing, Taizhou, Ning Shao, Nanhua, Dada, Dahu, Tonghua, Antai, Chang'an, and Zhengji.

<h3>New County Public Security Bureau Chief Assumes Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua, because of the salary arrears during the tenure of former Chief Zhu, has had funds raised and advanced by the Political Affairs Bureau, so he came to the bureau on the evening of the 17th to take over. Former Chief Zhu Chang transferred the seals and documents separately. Yesterday, Chief Shen announced the appointment of the general bureau staff as follows: Xue Fengluan, Chief of the General Affairs Section; Cai Zhongji, Chief of the Administrative Section; Shi De (reappointed), Chief of the Judicial Section; Zhao Lian, Chief Inspector.

<h3>Guangdong Merchants Organize World Liaison Group</h3>
<p>To Develop Foreign Trade</p>
<p>In recent years, European and American countries have organized world travel groups to visit China every year, with at least six or seven groups and at least two to three thousand members visiting China. However, China alone has been lacking in this regard. This time, the American company Arnhold &amp; Co., together with various commercial groups in Guangdong, also discussed forming a Chinese world travel group, called the "Guangdong Commercial Expansion and World Tour Liaison Investigation Group." The number of members is fixed at seventy-five. The places to be visited include Fiji, Southeast Asia, Siam, Ceylon, Suez, Egypt, the Mediterranean, Italy, Rome, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, Japan, and more than ten other countries, covering twenty-one major ports, with a duration of six months. The purpose of this tour is to develop our country's foreign trade. Therefore, each industry group can first set up a commodity exhibition hall on the ship they are traveling on to display China's production and commercial goods. Each time they arrive at a port, they will display these goods in the important locations of the major ports to promote sales and can directly sell them. This move is strongly supported by the military and political circles in Guangdong. A preparation office has now been established in Saiki, Guangdong. More than half of those who wish to join this group have already joined. Since Shanghai is a commercial hub, special personnel have been sent to Shanghai to liaise with various industry groups to solicit members. Once the quota of seventy-five people is met, the goods of this country will be loaded and handed over to Arnhold &amp; Co., and then the date of departure will be agreed upon to implement the marine display of domestic goods and actively promote international trade. This move is also an innovation in our country's commerce.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Export Cargo Congestion</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchant Shipping Business Booms</p>
<p>Upper River Navigation: Since the Yangtze River's upstream waterways have been shallow and closed since last winter, Shanghai has accumulated a lot of cargo. Since the 16th of this month, Hankou to Yichang has had a draft of nine feet. Passenger groups from Yichang, Shashi, Chongqing, and Xiangtan have been sending telegrams to Shanghai urging the loading of goods to go to the market. The Taikoo Company has ordered the Wanliu to resume its shift today, heading to Yichang. Jardine Matheson has also dispatched the Jiahe and Pinghe to resume their Upper River route. Nisshin and Jiejiang have also opened special Shanghai-Yichang routes. All will be opening their first ships starting today. All ships leaving the port are fully loaded with goods, mostly cotton yarn and sugar. As for the foreign ships on the Yangtze River route, four ships currently depart every day, but the amount of incoming cargo is not much. As for exports, the demand exceeds the supply. Because there are thirteen Chinese ships that can sail every week, only two ships are currently leaving, so the foreign shipping business is getting bigger.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Shortage of Ships: Since last week, the Shanghai to Fuzhou route has suddenly become a situation of more goods than ships. After all four China ships stopped sailing, the Japanese Osaka Company and Kawasaki's Kazayama-maru took advantage of this opportunity to do good business, with both cargo and passengers overflowing. Yesterday, a certain Japanese ship going to Fujian even had a temporary customs refusal due to too many export passengers and cargo. Customers in Fujian have also telegraphed Shanghai requesting tonnage, but Chinese merchants have no ships to meet the demand.</p>
<p>North-South Direct Shipping: The British Taikoo Company, in response to the demands of North and South Ocean merchants, has added two new North Ocean direct routes during this time of cargo congestion in various ports, specializing in transporting beans, sorghum, bean cakes, and oil from Newchwang to Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou ports. Five ships, including Newchwang, De'an, Zhen'an, Liangzhou, and Yingzhou, have been designated to operate this Guangzhou-Newchwang route. Jardine Matheson has also dispatched Changsheng and Jiesheng to operate the Guangzhou-Tianjin route. Nisshin Company has also transferred Jinshan and Baling to operate the Guangzhou-Tianjin route. Today, the Jiesheng is passing Shanghai and going to Tianjin, but because the cargo is already full, it has rejected all passengers and cargo going to Tianjin from Shanghai. The number of North-South direct ships this year has suddenly increased by nine.</p>
<p>Coastal Cargo Congestion: Recently, all foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to the North and South Oceans are fully loaded with export cargo. The freight income of each shipping company has increased by about double compared to normal times. However, Jardine Matheson's North Ocean ships are slightly inferior due to the past winter's competition from customs brokers.</p>
<h3>What We Heard Before the Shanghai Municipal Council Board Election</h3>
<p>Changes in Western Directors: The Shanghai Times reports that there may be three or four changes in the upcoming Municipal Council board election. Besides the Japanese Director Funatsu, who is unwilling to run due to pressing matters, the Japanese community will nominate Saito of the Japanese Post to replace him. Yesterday (17th), it was heard that American Directors Franzen and Lyman are unwilling to run, one because he is returning to his country and the other because of illness. There are no fewer than twenty-five American expatriates with candidacy qualifications for these two vacancies. Ace has the highest voice. In addition, there are also rumors that one British director is unwilling to run, but this could not be confirmed yesterday. It was only heard that he is carefully considering it. All three current Chinese directors are willing to run. However, after the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors by two is passed, it is still unknown who will be elected.</p>
<p>Portuguese Community Demands a Seat: The Great Evening News reports that the hundred or so Portuguese expatriates in this port held a meeting of expatriates at the Portuguese General Association last night (17th). Mr. Sousa of Sousa &amp; Co. proposed that the Portuguese community in this port is growing, and they should demand a seat on the Municipal Council to protect the interests of their compatriots. After discussion among the members, ten members were elected to study the implementation methods and draft a report to be sent to Mr. Fitan, legal advisor of the Municipal Council. After the ten members were elected, they discussed the matter in detail and the general meeting decided that a candidate would be nominated first and the list would be sent to the Municipal Council according to the procedures. It was also decided to continue the meeting in the coming days to actively proceed with the matter.</p>
<h3>Continuation of Construction on the Bei Hui County Road</h3>
<p>The compulsory construction of the Beihui County Road has been enthusiastically responded to by farmers since construction resumed on the 16th of this month. About two hundred people came on the first day, three or four hundred on the second day, and yesterday the number increased to five or six hundred. They are all led by General Section Chief Wang Chengyao, Section Chiefs Yang Shunfan and Xu Yunzhou, and Small Section Chiefs Zhang Jinrong, Dong Nanchang, Tang Bingqing, Zhu Wenxiang, Zhang Xiangsheng, Huang Jingtang, Nie Qiaosheng, He Genrong, and Nie Shouyan. General Section Chief Wang Chengyao is particularly diligent. The County Construction Bureau has also sent Director Huang of the Highway Department and Technician Shen to guide the rural road construction. Bureau Chief Wu Wenhua went to Beihui Road to inspect yesterday, and the result was very satisfactory. Sections 4, 8, 9, and 10 in the sixth district have all started construction one after another. In the third district, the roadbed is already taking shape, but there are still imperfections, so the bureau has sent Director Huang to guide the construction, and it will start construction in the coming days. If it does not rain, it can be completed by the end of this month at the latest.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Relief Committee</h3>
<p>The Red Cross Relief Committee held its fifth committee meeting the other day. Li Weihou was ill and requested Wang Yiting to be the chairman. The first report was on the fundraising and relief distribution situation. Huang Tan, the economic director, asked Jiang Qudan to report on the pagoda donation account, which showed a revenue of slightly less than 250,000 yuan, an expenditure of slightly less than 200,000 yuan, and a surplus of over 48,000 yuan. In addition, a classified report was given on relief distribution for women and children, disaster victims, cotton clothing, travel expenses, printing wages, rent, etc. It was stated that all income and expenditure strictly followed the original strict supervision rules, and were approved and signed by the economic committee and the chairman after public decision. It was decided to first ask the two economic officials Huang and Tan to examine the accounts clearly, and then ask the accountant to review and publish them in the newspaper, as well as print tens of thousands of detailed credit reports to be distributed to various donors. Chairman Wang praised the enthusiasm and perseverance of the supporting committee members and various branches, who raised a large amount of money. He divided them into three grades of A, B, and C, and presented gold watches, plaques, and meritorious service medals. It was also decided to present a plaque to Du Yuesheng, Xia Yingtang, and the postal workers' union. Yao Yuqin and Ha Shaofu were asked to review it. In addition, Secretary Wei Ruifeng reported on the disasters in various disaster areas, which were deep and widespread, with tears in his voice. He also reported on the transfer of disaster children to Shanghai, their transportation to Jiangmen, and the disaster children stranded in Beiping, Luoyang, and Kaifeng, numbering six to seven hundred. The road ahead is long, and many hands make light work, but it is difficult to support it alone. He urged factories and schools to take responsibility for it. Jiang Qudan said that fundraising was difficult, his cough and asthma had worsened, and he strongly requested a rest or approval to end the fundraising. Lin Kanghou said that Jiang was able to create the pagoda donation with his spirit, thoughts, talents, and efforts, raising 250,000 yuan, which was not easy in the current situation. His hard work and perseverance are deeply admired. As for the matter of rest, someone should be found to replace him to balance labor and leisure. As for the end of the fundraising, only the first phase of accounts should be ended, indicating that public fundraising is everyone's responsibility. The more fundraising organizations, the more chances of survival for dying compatriots. There is no patent that prohibits counterfeiting. Hong Yanbin, Huang Zijing, Xia Yingtang, Zhang Tianxi, Lu Wenzhong, and Li Hongsheng all said that the difficulty of raising money in recent years was ten times greater than before. The reputation of the Red Cross is excellent, and it should be established as a permanent organization. Wang Yiting said that this is a great catastrophe, and only accumulating good deeds can eliminate it. The retribution of good and evil is faster than lightning. Jiang is enthusiastic about relief and has outstanding talents. Do not be discouraged. Then, a public banquet was held for representatives of Red Cross branches from various provinces and relief representatives. Fifty-one people attended, and they all dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Change of Commander of Hai Ou Gunboat</h3>
<p>Du Gongxin, the commander of the Hai Ou gunboat, which was newly incorporated into the Second Fleet of the Navy, was recently removed from his post because soldiers of the gunboat caused trouble in Shenjiamen, Dinghai. After the Navy Department in Nanjing learned the details, it was deemed that the soldiers' trouble was due to the commander's lax discipline. Therefore, a special order was issued to remove Du Gongxin from his post. He Tianyu, the deputy commander of the Jiangyuan gunboat, has been promoted to fill the vacancy. It is said that the Hai Ou is currently berthed in Gaochang Temple Port.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Investigates Qualifications</h3>
<p>The General Election of the Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession will be held soon. The rights to elect and be elected by taxpayers need to be investigated and registered urgently. In addition to having published a public notice in the newspaper, letters were also sent to various taxpayers yesterday to investigate the amount of taxes paid, with a deadline for reporting in order to verify qualifications and distribute ballots.</p>
<h3>Li Hongbin Goes to Beijing</h3>
<p>Petition to Abolish River Management Funds</p>
<p>The Navigation Guilds of Jiangsu Province have petitioned several times to abolish the collection of internal river management funds, but the order has not been revoked. The navigation industry in various places had no choice but to go to Beijing separately a few days ago to petition the Executive Yuan. The representative from this port is Mr. Zha Hongbin.</p>
<h3>Organizational Outline of the National Goods Market</h3>
<p>The Temporary National Goods Market of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association is scheduled to open on February 25 at the Penglai Market. The organizational outline was drafted yesterday, divided into seven sections: General Affairs, Documents, Solicitation, Finance, Market Affairs, Publicity, and Discipline. Representatives from the Disaster Relief Association, five national goods organizations, and various factories, totaling thirty-five people, will form a committee to handle it. If any factory joins and sells goods that are foreign-made, the goods will be confiscated and severely punished upon discovery. Those who register at the Ningbo Native Place Association will pay 20 yuan per room for the joint fee and management fee, and 5 yuan per room for the market rent. Each stall will be equipped with three electric lights, and each light will cost 1 yuan. If more are needed, the number of lights will be calculated. A voluntary application must be filled out first. The business period is tentatively set for two weeks (extendable). The committee members of each section have been appointed, and a meeting of all section chiefs will be held tomorrow (the 20th) to discuss the proceedings.</p>
<h3>Fei Xiaochu Returns to Shanghai to Report</h3>
<p>Investigation of Nanyang Industries</p>
<p>Mr. Fei Xiaochu, who was sent by the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation last year to investigate industries in various ports in Nanyang, Shantou, Fuzhou, and other places, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he went to the Federation to report on the situation of this investigation. The members Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Bingsen, and Jiang Zhonghe warmly received him, and a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees is planned to be convened to ask Mr. Fei to report in detail.</p>
<h3>Rice Boat Owners Eager for Rice Industry Wharf</h3>
<p>The construction of a rice industry wharf in the Nanshi area has been agreed upon, with the location selected at the San Tai Wharf, and the lease has been settled with the Port Affairs Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau. Construction was about to begin, but it has now been delayed. The rice boat owners are very eager and have been questioning the rice merchants about the reason for the delay. Yesterday afternoon, a meeting was held in Yizhi Chun. Everyone said that the construction of the wharf is not only convenient for our rice boats, but also has a great impact on the business of rice shops and rice customers. We have repeatedly requested it before, but the excuse was always that there was no land. Now that the location has been settled, delaying the construction is incomprehensible. After discussion, it was decided that if the wharf is not built, all rice boats coming to Shanghai will dock in the river after arriving. If anything unexpected happens, the boat owners will not be responsible, and the loss suffered by the boat will be compensated by the cargo owner. This should be notified immediately and sent to the cargo owner when loading rice. At the same time, the Rice Merchants' Association should be asked to urge the construction and inquire about the reason for the delay.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Bans the Revolutionary News Agency</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government approved a letter from the Central Propaganda Department, stating that the Shanghai Revolutionary Military News Agency was suspected of publishing the "New China Daily" and raising funds for its founding. After instructing the investigators stationed in Shanghai to investigate secretly, the reply stated that Li Jianhong, the president of the Revolutionary Military News Agency, was from Anhui Province and had previously run a very boring small newspaper in Shanghai. After the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Nanjing, he served as the director of the political department of the Lai Shih-huang unit. He also worked in the political department of the guerrilla unit of the Temporary First Division in the Xuhai area. Recently, due to lack of work, he came to Shanghai to run the Revolutionary Military News Agency. Another person in charge of the agency is Sun Gongjun, who is from Changzhou. The agency is located at 677 Kangle Lane, Connaught Road. There is an extremely small banner outside the door with the words "Military News Agency." There is no office equipment in the office. According to the person in charge of the agency, the agency's manuscripts are published irregularly, but no agencies, newspapers, or postal inspection offices in Shanghai have ever found the agency's manuscripts. It is actually a means of empty-handed deception. Someone gives a subsidy, and then a small amount of agency manuscripts are mimeographed for reimbursement. The purpose of founding the "New China Daily" is also just to defraud money, etc. After reviewing the report, it was found that Li Jianhong founded the Revolutionary Military News Agency and the "New China Daily" not out of a genuine desire to run a news business, but purely to defraud money under false pretenses, which is very hateful and should be strictly banned to avoid harming society. In addition to ordering the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Department to find a way to ban it, a corresponding letter is sent to your government for investigation and strict ban, and a reply is requested, etc. It is heard that the municipal government has already instructed the Public Security Bureau to investigate and handle it.</p>

It was decided to complete the report to the district within three days. However, the townships of Jianhe and Wuwei, etc., were slightly extended due to the complicated procedures of dividing the territory. It should be completed and reported to the district within five days as much as possible. (2) How to carry out the personnel registration?

It was decided to submit a report to the county government to clearly abolish the tu directors. The existing dibao should be under the command and supervision of the township and town heads. (8) How should the official deeds of land and house sales be banned so that they are all reported for collection? It was decided to hand it over to the heads of various townships and towns to inform all sectors of society that if there are land and house sales, they must be reported for official deeds. If there is any concealment, they will be severely punished. (9) The heads of various townships and towns should affix a stamp on the draft deed of land and house sales to show prudence.

<h3>Question of Mr. Chatley's Reappointment</h3>
<p>Song Zi Liang, the Director-General of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, went to Beijing the other day to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the term of contract of Mr. Chatley, the Chief Engineer of the Board. It is said that regarding this issue, the Inspectorate of Customs and the River Conservancy Bureau have sent letters to inquire about the conditions and term of the Chief Engineer's reappointment. However, the Chief Engineer has expressed his desire to be reappointed for a term of four years. Director Song believes that the term is too long and has requested instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Amendment of the Municipal Single Sanitary Regulations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Ministry of Health</p>
<p>The Municipal Government consulted the Ministry of Health for verification and reply</p>
<p>The Special Municipal Health Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Health to amend the city's single sanitary regulations. The bureau immediately submitted a request to the Municipal Government for transfer to the Ministry of Health. The Municipal Government consulted the Ministry of Health yesterday, stating that it was for the purpose of consultation. According to the Health Bureau's report, the bureau checked the Ministry of Health's Order No. 51 dated December 12 of the previous year, which stated that the Ministry is in charge of national health administration affairs, and all provincial and municipal health administration matters are subject to assessment. All health regulations, in addition to being submitted by the National Government's Executive Yuan for promulgation, or being approved by the Ministry for promulgation, all provisional regulations and rules formulated by the provinces and cities themselves must be submitted to the Ministry for approval before promulgation. Otherwise, there may be violations and conflicts, and the Ministry will have no way to correct them, which will cause many abuses. For this reason, a circular is issued to clarify that in the future, all subordinate units must first report and determine any self-made regulations and rules before implementing them. Those that have been promulgated before the order arrives should also be reported for the record for assessment. In addition to distribution, compliance is required, etc. After the bureau reported back, briefly stating the procedure for formulating single sanitary regulations in the Shanghai Special Municipality, although the bureau drafted the draft regulations, whether they are appropriate or whether they can be implemented is based on the provisions of Article 8 of the Special Municipal Organization Law, which requires submission to your government for a decision. If approved, they will be promulgated in the name of your government. Therefore, the power to promulgate the city's single sanitary regulations does not belong to the bureau's authority. The reason for the previous order should be consulted by the Ministry. Please check with your government, etc., and attached three volumes of the city's health regulations printed by the bureau in May of the 18th year. Now, in accordance with the Ministry of Health's Order No. 197, the report and attached three volumes of single regulations are known. After checking, the various rules are generally in compliance. However, Article 5 of the Rules for the Suppression of Funeral Homes states that the storage time is limited to ten years, which is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Coffin Storage promulgated by the Ministry. It should still be revised in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Also, the medical examination should be held twice a year, which is too frequent. It should be changed to once a year to be consistent with the methods of various provinces and cities. You should also be informed of this order, and the attachments will be kept, etc. Upon receiving this, it was found that Article 5 of the city's Rules for the Suppression of Funeral Homes was approved and revised by your government on June 20 of the 18th year, stating that the storage of coffins in funeral homes should be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Health's Regulations for the Suppression of Coffin Storage, and the storage period should be temporarily set at a maximum of one year in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Ministry's Regulations for the Suppression of Coffin Storage to facilitate the transfer of corpses by the owners, etc. If it is necessary to strictly comply with the provisions of Article 2 of the Ministry's regulations, the coffin storage period, except for special approval, may be stored for a maximum of 90 days, and at most not more than 60 days. Most of the people in this city are from all over the country, and most of them come to make a living. If there are deaths, most of them are stored in funeral homes to wait for their families to transport them back to their hometown. The time limit is too short, and it may not be possible in fact. Therefore, the previous revision of Article 5 of the city's Rules for the Suppression of Funeral Homes took into account the situation and set it as a maximum of one year. Now, in accordance with the previous reason, should the special circumstances of the city be explained to negotiate a compromise, or should it be revised in accordance with the order? This should be reviewed and ordered separately for compliance. Also, the medical examination is conducted twice a year in accordance with Article 4 of the city's Medical Management Regulations. The first time is on June 1 and the second time is on December 1. This was originally to be considerate of medical doctors from other places who come to Shanghai to practice medicine so that it would be easier to apply for registration and avoid losses due to prolonged suspension of business. It is also a provision to cope with the special circumstances of the city, and there is no conflict with central laws and regulations. Now, in accordance with the Ministry's order, it is considered too frequent and should be changed to once a year to be consistent with the methods of various provinces and cities. Should Article 4 of the city's Medical Management Regulations be amended to be held once a year in June? This should be reviewed separately and notified for compliance. The various proposed situations for amending the city's single sanitary regulations in accordance with the Ministry's order are reasonably combined to submit for review and compliance, which is for the public convenience, etc. Accordingly, it was found that Article 5 of the Rules for the Suppression of Funeral Homes promulgated in December of the 17th year of this city originally stipulated that the storage period of coffins in funeral homes was limited to ten years. Then, in June of the 18th year, according to the report of the bureau, the previous suppression rules were inconsistent with the provisions of Article 2 of the Ministry's Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Coffin Storage, and it was proposed to change it to "The storage of coffins in funeral homes should be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Health's Regulations for the Suppression of Coffin Storage, and the storage period should be temporarily set at a maximum of one year in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Ministry's Regulations for the Suppression of Coffin Storage to facilitate the transfer of corpses by the owners," etc. The amendment of the terms was indeed a temporary regulation based on Shanghai's circumstances. If it must be handled in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, the coffin storage period, except for special permission, may be stored for a maximum of 60 days. In fact, it is sincerely feared that difficulties will arise, such as the previous request of the representatives of the Shanghai Guilds and Public Associations, such as Wang Xiaolai, to postpone the implementation of the Coffin Storage Suppression Regulations. Therefore, permission was granted to change it and promulgate it for implementation. When the bureau submitted the health regulations, it did not correct the previous rules, causing your ministry to believe that there was a need for amendment. A special consultation is requested for verification. As for the Chinese medicine examination, the situation in Shanghai is relatively different. For the convenience of medical doctors from other places who come to Shanghai to practice medicine, it seems that it should be held twice a year in accordance with the city's Medical Management Regulations. A corresponding consultation is requested for verification and reply, etc.</p>

<h3>Hua Dawei, Accused of Bigamy, Was Sentenced Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment Suspended for One Year</p>
<p>Tang Manqi and Yang Yonghua Were Acquitted</p>
<p>Hua Dawei, from Changzhou, was first married in his hometown to a woman named Yang Yonghua by his parents through a matchmaker. Later, his wife came to Shanghai to study, and he fell in love with a female student named Tang Manqi and married her as well. A family storm then arose. Fortunately, through the mediation of relatives, the emotional sea did not surge, but it has recently not been prevented from venting. Ms. Yang came to Shanghai and accused Hua of bigamy in the Provisional Court. Ms. Tang also filed a counterclaim against Ms. Yang. The situation of the repeated trials by the court has been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the verdict of the case. At 9:00 AM, both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, arrived at the seventh courtroom to await instructions. Then, Judge Ge Sixun ascended the seat and sentenced Hua Dawei to one year's imprisonment, suspended for two years. Tang Manqi and Yang Yonghua were both acquitted. The civil suit of Hua Yang Yonghua against Hua Dawei was transferred to the Civil Division of the court for trial.

<h3>Robbery and Shooting, Stray Bullet Wounds an Innocent Person</h3>
<p>Young Girl Reports to the Police</p>
<p>Nothing Was Robbed</p>
<p>One Thief Was Arrested</p>
<p>Two Passersby Were Injured</p>
<p>Dai Wenpin, the boss of Dai Yuancheng Clothing Store at No. 382-3 New Dagulu, returned from outside at about 8:45 last night. Suddenly, four robbers followed him in from the front door to the shop. They forbade him from making a sound and immediately started robbing. At that time, Dai's young daughter, Meifang, 13 years old, was washing her feet. She saw four strangers following her father and holding firearms. In a moment of urgency, she retreated out of the store.</p>
<p>Young Girl Reports to the Police Meifang escaped from the back door and ran straight to the intersection of New Dagulu and South Chengdu Road. She saw two Indian policemen, 172 and 179, and immediately ran up to report to the police, shouting that there were robbers. The Indian policemen heard the news and immediately went to arrest them, and Chinese policemen 153 and 758 also went to support them. At this time, the thieves knew that they could not rob, so they rushed out and met the policemen, and immediately opened fire.</p>
<p>One Thief Was Caught The three thieves, carrying pistols, exchanged fire with the police, firing no less than thirteen or fourteen shots. Then they fled. One thief was arrested by the police and escorted to the police station. When the incident happened, West Detective Gelab of the New Zha Police Station and Chinese Detective Che Xueceng rushed to hunt them down.</p>
<p>Two People Were Injured The two injured were Huang Lianbao, 51 years old, from Wenzhou, living at No. 427, Changrong Lane, New Dagulu, working as a cook for a Westerner at No. 7 Kad Road. He was shot in the left leg and was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Fierce Battle Between Tongru Port Marine Police and Pirates Outside Wusong Port</h3>
<p>Chen Xin, the captain of the 18th team of the 4th District of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Team, led a patrol boat at about 12:00 the night before last. When patrolling the area near Tongru Port outside Wusong Port, he suddenly saw three black, large, king-masted sailing ships about a mile away from the port, which looked very suspicious. Captain Chen then ordered the patrol boat to be on alert and approached the sailing ships. Just as he was about to question them, the sailing ships saw the patrol boat and immediately used searchlights to illuminate it. Then they opened fire on the patrol boat. The patrol boat realized that they were all pirate ships and opened fire in return. They also used searchlights and saw about 150-160 pirates on the three ships. At that time, the pirate ships surrounded the patrol boat.</p>
<p>Attempting to Rob Realizing the dangerous situation, Captain Chen immediately ordered to open fire with rapid-fire guns. Seeing the fierce fire from the patrol boat, the pirate ships dared not approach. The two sides fought fiercely for about half an hour. A cannon on one of the pirate ships was broken by artillery shells and fell into the water. The pirate ships then sped eastward and escaped. Because it was late at night, they all escaped. Although the patrol boat chased after them, by the time the sky broke yesterday morning, there was no trace of the pirate ships.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Assists Xinzhuang with Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>An epidemic has occurred in the Xinzhuang area of Songjiang, a neighboring county. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, fearing that it would affect the city, sent personnel from the Epidemic Prevention Section of the Fourth Division to investigate. The Fourth District Office of Songjiang County sent a letter to the Health Bureau, saying that our district has an epidemic of meningitis. We are grateful for your bureau's attention in sending personnel to investigate the actual situation and explain prevention methods. However, our district is located in a remote rural area and lacks appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and prevention methods. We would like to request your assistance regardless of boundaries in order to eliminate it as soon as possible. We hope that you will treat us as equals and approve our request, etc. Because Xinzhuang is adjacent to this city, the Municipal Health Bureau can provide assistance within its capabilities. It is scheduled to send personnel to assist in the implementation of preventive injections and public lectures on the morning of the 20th of this month. It has replied to the district office to prepare a place for mass injections and lectures, and to notify the people of the district in advance to gather at that time for injections. Preventive injections can also be requested from the bureau for any gatherings of 30 or more people in this city.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Bans Substandard Vehicles in Gaoqiao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities previously found that the operating automobiles and rickshaws in the Gaoqiao area were mostly dilapidated and defective, which hindered traffic safety. On January 28, it sent two technicians, Qin and Lu, to inspect them and instructed them on the points that should be repaired. They were to be completed before February 14. On February 15, the technicians went to re-inspect. After the inspection, it was found that two operating automobiles were still dilapidated, and most of the operating rickshaws were not equipped with iron rear braces (commonly known as "wild chicken tails"), and some had not been inspected. In addition to recalling the licenses of the two automobiles, they were not allowed to drive until they were repaired, reported, and inspected to be qualified. The Gaoqiao District Municipal Committee Office has been ordered to re-examine the rickshaws that have not passed the inspection when issuing donation licenses. If they are still not equipped with iron rear braces, the donation licenses will be withheld and driving will be prohibited. The Public Security Bureau has also been requested to strictly ban them in the area under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Prevention of Smallpox Epidemic in Pudong</h3>
<p>City Health Bureau Establishes Vaccination Center</p>
<p>The outbreak of smallpox in the coastal areas of Pudong has been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The City Health Bureau is paying great attention to this matter. Yesterday, a staff member, Mr. Yang, was specially dispatched to Pudong for investigation. Considering that Pudong is densely populated with migrants, and many patients are still unaware of seeking medical treatment at hospitals, which could lead to loss of life, a vaccination center has been established within the Pudong Hospital, located on the police station road. This center will administer cowpox vaccinations to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<h3>Fourth Session of Chinese Medicine Registration Examination Committee</h3>
<p>Approved by the City Government</p>
<p>List of Committee Members</p>
<p>Previously, the City Government received a report from the Health Bureau stating that the registration period for the Fourth Session of Chinese Medicine Registration had ended. It was proposed to follow the previous registration methods, requesting various Chinese medicine organizations to recommend individuals with excellent character and scholarship to form the Fourth Session of Chinese Medicine Registration Examination Committee to handle review and examination matters. Now, all associations have submitted their recommendations. The proposal to review and approve the list of committee members has been heard. The City Government has approved this list. The following is an excerpt: Chen Shuhan and Xu Songhou, both recommended by the Chinese Medicine United Association; Fang Gongpu, Gu Weichuan, and Jiang Wenfang, all recommended by the Shenzhou Medical Association; He Yunsheng and Chen Yaotang, both recommended by the Chinese Medical Association.</p>
<h3>Reopening Issue of Water Furnace Businesses</h3>
<p>Hang Guozhi, Director of the Water Furnace Guild, recently submitted a petition to the Shanghai Special City Government seeking clarification on regulations regarding the refusal to issue licenses for overdue reconstruction of water furnace businesses. The City Government has approved the petition, stating that the Social Bureau has been instructed to investigate and respond. The report states that since the Social Bureau has been handling the registration of agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations, requests from agricultural, industrial, and commercial organizations that have not been registered will not be accepted, as previously announced. The Water Furnace Guild is an unregistered organization. Although the guild's regulations were approved and filed by the former Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Bureau, after the promulgation of the Shanghai Hot Water Shop Operating Rules, any guild rules that conflict with laws and regulations are not applicable. Even if they do not conflict, the guild's legal status no longer exists, rendering them ineffective. Hang Guozhi's use of his old title as Director of the Water Furnace Company to present arguments is inappropriate. Even if we consider the petition's claim that the water furnace business was closed for less than a year, and that the existing regulations of the water furnace company should still be referenced until officially cancelled by the government, this is still a selective interpretation. Article 11 of the regulations states that old shops that need to relocate due to reconstruction or negligence may be allowed to find a nearby location to reopen, or those that temporarily close due to losses may be allowed to reopen within one year. The phrase "allowed to reopen within one year" clearly refers to closures due to losses. For old shops relocating due to reconstruction, they are only allowed to find a nearby location to reopen, and there is no time limit specified. The deadline should be based on the reconstruction completion date stated in the petition. If there is no hope of reopening after the deadline, and someone else can establish a water furnace to meet the needs of residents, it is difficult to maintain the operation of one shop at the expense of the convenience of many. Therefore, the registration can only be revoked, and the establishment of a new shop can be approved. However, the bureau has never failed to show leniency to water furnace businesses that cannot reopen due to overdue reconstruction, as evidenced by the case of Zhou Yongquan of Yongxiangxuan, whose reopening was repeatedly extended for as long as eight months. The petitioner's language is disrespectful and inappropriate and should be rejected. This is the decision.</p>
<h3>Maoye Bank Registers Creditors' Rights</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the General Liquidation Office of Maoye Bank on November 2nd last year, the Ministry of Finance has announced the liquidation regulations and implementation rules. The Executive Yuan has also forwarded them to the Judicial Yuan, instructing all judicial organs to investigate and handle the procedures, which has been swift and thorough. Since the liquidation regulations have legal effect, the office is conducting the liquidation in accordance with the regulations. Creditors of the Shanghai and Hankou branches have begun registration since December 23rd. Currently, more than half of the accounts have been registered. Letters from distant provinces requesting registration are still arriving continuously.</p>
<h3>Indian Merchant Wanlai Foreign Firm Establishes Branch in Shanghai</h3>
<p>29 Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The Indian merchant Wanlai Foreign Firm specializes in selling Indian-produced cotton. Mr. Wan Hailai, the owner, is a prominent figure in the Indian cotton industry, with assets reaching 10 million Indian rupees. He has 25 cotton ginning and packaging factories in Bailuoxi (an Indian cotton-producing region). Approximately more than half of the cotton produced in that area each year, about 400,000 bales, is ginned in Wan's factories. Its headquarters is located in India, and it also has agents in Japan, Liverpool in the United Kingdom, and various ports in Europe and America to handle sales matters. The annual export of Indian cotton is more than 75,000 bales. In the Mumbai area, it also engages in commercial activities such as acting as an agent for loans and brokerage. Its agents transport Indian cotton from the Ama area to Mumbai and store it in the firm's wharf warehouses. They provide cash advances of 90% of the market price as operating capital. Each year, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 bales of Indian cotton are sold using this method. The firm's employees have extensive experience in the cotton industry. Every bale of cotton sold from Mumbai is inspected by the firm's specialists, ensuring the quality of the cotton. In addition to being a member of (1) the East India Cotton Association, (2) the Mumbai Brokers' Association, and (3) the Liverpool Cotton Exchange, the firm also has four brokers on the New York Cotton Exchange, making its business extremely prosperous. It already had agents residing in Shanghai to sell the firm's cotton. Now, considering that Shanghai is the center of China's industry and commerce, with the highest annual cotton sales volume, and that selling through agents requires paying commissions, customers often cannot obtain low prices and the procedures are complicated. Therefore, to facilitate customers' needs, eliminate various obstacles, and promote trade in the East, the firm has specially dispatched personnel to Shanghai this year to establish a branch at 29 Sichuan Road, and has hired Mr. Feng, a Shanghai merchant, as the Chinese manager to oversee all matters. Mr. Feng has hired Mr. Xu as his assistant. Both gentlemen have extensive experience in cotton trading and have connections with various yarn factories in the area. Since taking office, they have been informally conducting business, and many factories have already placed orders. It is said that the firm plans to formally open on another date. It is expected that customers will be even more enthusiastic then.</p>
<h3>New General Manager and Deputy General Manager of Meifu Company</h3>
<p>New York Meifu Company recently announced that Mr. P.S. Hopkins, the outgoing General Manager of the China Division, will resign at the end of this month. Effective March 1st, Mr. F.J. Twogood will be appointed as the General Manager of China, and Mr. R.J. Corbett will be appointed as the Deputy General Manager.</p>
<h3>Electric Power Company Hires Mr. Hopkin</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Mr. Hopkin has resigned from his position as Manager of the Beiping Meifu Oil Company in response to an invitation from the Electric Power Company of the United States and other countries. (Note: The Shanghai branch of the Electric Power Company of the United States and other countries is the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which acquired the Shanghai Municipal Council Electric Plant last year.) Although only middle-aged, Mr. Hopkin has held important commercial positions in China for many years. Born in Beiping, he returned to the United States at the age of fifteen to study. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in engineering and devoted himself to the study of mining and oil production for several years. Later, in 1915, he returned to China to work for the Meifu Company. Having been in China for a long time, he has a thorough understanding of the Chinese situation and has always believed that China's future is unlimited. Now that he has been invited by the Electric Power Company, he will surely be able to make great contributions to China's electrical industry and economy. Mr. Hopkin has also been hired as the General Manager and Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Shanghai Electric Power Company. Mr. Dairo remains the Deputy Manager of the company.</p>
<h3>Actress's Foot Injury Appeal Case</h3>
<p>Arguments Concluded, Judgment Scheduled</p>
<p>Qian Xiufang, a Zhejiang native residing at 372 Mahu Chongren Lane, and wife of Xu Hengzhi, was admitted to the Youlian Film Company as an actress through the Renxing Film Introduction Agency last summer. The company later filmed the play "Hidden Pain," with Qian playing a bridesmaid. Qian was ill at the time and tried to decline but was unsuccessful. She had to perform despite her illness. During the performance, the temporary wedding hall, which was about ten feet high, suddenly collapsed, and Qian's left foot was injured. Although she recovered later, she became lame. She and her husband, Xu Hengzhi, sued Chen Kengran, the manager of Youlian, for negligence of duty and illegal detention, and filed a civil lawsuit seeking one thousand dollars in damages. The Provisional Court ruled that the illegal detention charge was not established. Chen was fined two hundred dollars for the crime of negligence causing injury, with a suspended sentence. The private lawsuit portion of the case was ordered to pay twelve hundred dollars for the loss of damages. However, Chen Kengran declared his dissatisfaction with the ruling and appealed. The Court of Appeal also held a hearing once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiu, together with Prosecutors Shen and Li, held a continued hearing. The court first distributed the appraisal report of Niu Huisheng, who treated Qian, to the lawyers of both parties. The appraisal report stated that Qian Xiufang's ankle bone was broken and could not be restored. Then, witness Pan Shouhua was called to testify. He claimed that he introduced Qian Xiufang to be an actress, stating that the daily wage was three dollars. He did not know about her injury at first but heard about it later. Her husband, Xu Hengzhi, ordered him to go to Youlian to demand fifty dollars in compensation, but the company only agreed to give thirty dollars, so there was no result. Later, Xu invited six or seven people, including a Mr. Zhang, to go together. Chen saw many people and mistakenly thought they were hooligans, so a conflict arose. The police station was called. Xu accused Chen of illegal detention, and Chen accused Xu of leading hooligans to cause trouble. The police station did not accept the case. He did not know the situation after that. Witness Zhu Yaoting testified that he was a temporary actor at Youlian and played the host of the wedding in the play, standing opposite Qian. Although the wedding hall was about ten feet high, it did not appear to be dangerous at first glance. Qian did not appear to be afraid.

Her mother persuaded her to return home. Before returning, she went to Pengcheng Lane, 3 Wengjia Lane, Ximen, at the house of her former cohabitant, Fan Zhu, to relieve her boredom. Later, Kong Jinsheng returned home and did not see his wife. He went to his mother-in-law's house to look for her and learned that she was at Fan Zhu's house.

<h3>Incompatible Couple</h3>
<p>Ordered to Be Resolved in Local Court</p>
<p>Mi Chuxin, 28 years old, from Shaoxing, lived at 3 Hering Lane, Wangjia Wharf, Nanshi. His wife, Chen, 26 years old, was also from Shaoxing. However, she was not attractive, while Mi was very handsome. Therefore, his feelings for his wife gradually cooled, and he became disgusted with her. He completely ignored the household expenses. Ms. Chen's life became increasingly difficult. Last winter, she repeatedly asked her husband for household expenses, but Mi refused to give them to her, resulting in a major conflict between the couple. They even fought each other to the First District, First Precinct police station. The chief of the police station conducted a preliminary hearing, ordered them to reconcile as husband and wife, and warned them not to start disputes recklessly. They were then released on bail. After Ms. Chen returned home, she became depressed and ill, bedridden for more than a month, because she felt she had married the wrong person. She finally recovered the day before yesterday. Ms. Chen remained unwilling to accept the situation. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, she had another major confrontation with her husband. They disagreed and engaged in another conflict, pulling each other to the police station again. Ms. Chen complained that her husband was still bullying her and requested the police to intervene. After a preliminary hearing, the chief of the police station, seeing that they were unwilling to reconcile, ordered them to prepare a document and transfer the case to the Shanghai Local Court for resolution.</p>
<h3>Yang Chengkun Sues Wife, Father-in-Law and Matchmaker</h3>
<p>For Fraud and Theft</p>
<p>Yang Chengkun, from Yuyao, married Chen Ahua, daughter of Chen Xirong, six years ago. After she entered his household, the couple did not get along well, and she soon returned to her mother's home. It has been four years since then. Both parties now live in Shanghai. Yang runs the Minli Inn on Wuzhen Road in Zhabei, while Chen lives in the Sendaxie Coal Store on Nancang Street. Yang, represented by lawyer Wang Xianggu, sued Chen Xirong, his mother-in-law Chen Wen, his wife Chen Ahua, and matchmaker Fang Guisheng for fraud and theft in the criminal court of the Local Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Deng held a hearing. The defendants were represented by lawyer Chen Wenxiang. According to the plaintiff's statement, since marrying Chen Ahua, Chen Ahua had absconded twice, resulting in the theft of four pieces of gold jewelry and clothing. The plaintiff had gone to his hometown to welcome her back, but his mother-in-law hid his wife, who refused to live with her husband and demanded 240 dollars for food expenses, but was unsuccessful. Chen Xirong and others then misappropriated 100 dollars of the plaintiff's savings. Therefore, the first part of the charges against the defendants was theft, and the second part was fraud. Chen Xirong claimed that he had advised his daughter to return, but she refused. As for subsidizing food expenses, it was his daughter's idea, and his daughter also went to collect the savings. Chen Ahua testified that she was 23 years old and married the plaintiff at 17. At 18, she left her husband's house because her husband wanted her to be a prostitute in the inn. She refused and was beaten. She suffered so much that she returned to Ningbo. She left alone and did not take anything with her. The second time was on July 3rd of the 15th year of the Republic of China. Because her parents sent her there, and they insisted that she stay, she had no choice but to leave. She was working in a silk factory and did not take anything. (Asked) Your husband wants you to return. What do you think? (Answer) I don't want to. The official said that at home, one follows one's father; when married, one follows one's husband. After marrying a man, one should naturally go with him. (Answer) I would rather be sued than return. Chen Wen testified that Ahua was her daughter. She advised her to return, but she refused. She said that her mother-in-law was fierce. However, writing a letter to request for food expenses was her daughter's idea. Fang Guisheng testified that it had nothing to do with him. The judge advised them to reconcile at the time, but the defendant Chen Ahua refused to return. Therefore, the arguments began. After the lawyers of both parties argued, the judge adjourned the case, stating that the judgment would be announced at a later date. The four defendants were released on bail and then dismissed from the court.</p>
<h3>Stealing Radishes Almost Leads to Armed Fight</h3>
<p>Gathering Crowd to Revenge Like Facing Great Enemy</p>
<p>Team Police Arrive and Arrest Eight</p>
<p>The radishes planted by Wu Abao in the field of Zhou Shen Lane, west of Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, are often dug up and stolen by outsiders. On the morning of the previous day, several men and women from Anhui, resembling workers, came again, holding shovels, knives, burlap bags, and poles to dig in the field. Wu found out and reported to the local security team, who dispersed them. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 PM, they gathered more than 100 accomplices (including three people wearing tattered old military uniforms), each holding sticks, to seek revenge. At that time, Wu's servant Zhou Jinji was working in the radish field. They stripped Zhou's clothes and put them on. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zhou escaped to Tushan Bay and reported to the local security team. After receiving the report, Huang Simei, the head of the team, together with Patrol Chief Liu Kerang, led the entire armed team police to the scene. They also notified Team Leader Song of the West Third Team of Tangjie to pursue them from the rear. They captured eight ringleaders on the spot: Xu Ruijia, Zhao Shunfa, Li Ruikai, Hu Benrui, Zhang Zibang, Chen Fhong (from Shaoxing), Wu Liansheng (from Nanjing), and Li Facai (Hu Benrui, who was wearing Zhou's stolen clothes). The rest saw that the situation was not good and each fled upon a secret signal. They were immediately taken back to the team headquarters and sent to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District. After a preliminary hearing by Director Xu, the case was transferred to the City Public Security Bureau for further investigation because it involved daytime theft and gathering a crowd to commit violence.</p>

<h3>Sharp Big Scissors Found</h3>
<p>Three People Escorted to Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Patrol Police Ma Yuqin, Liu Shouxin, and Liu Shaoqing of the First Precinct of Nanshi, at about 12:00 PM yesterday, while patrolling the Duojia Road area of the Nantai Wharf in Nanshi, saw three people walking ahead who looked suspicious. They went forward to conduct an inspection and found two very sharp triangular scissors hidden on the sides of the two people. They were weapons and obviously not good people. They were immediately taken to the police station. During the preliminary hearing by the chief of the police station, one of them identified himself as Shu Fulin, 33 years old, from Zhenjiang, living at 21 Chihe Tou. He claimed to be a blacksmith and that he often cleaned the mud and debris from the barges transporting sludge that were docked at the Fengji Wharf in Pubin, for which he was paid 200 cash by each boat. Recently, Zhang Gengsheng, a rogue living in Caoxie Bay, led a group of accomplices to forcibly take over the business and drove him away. Because his livelihood was affected, he was unwilling and specially made an appointment with his friends to go and seek revenge. Another identified himself as Xu Guanxun from Pudong, and another identified himself as Gao Amao from Tongzhou, both claiming that Shu had asked them to carry sharp weapons to help him vent his anger. The chief of the police station, seeing that they were all troublemakers, ordered them to prepare a document and transfer the case to the Third Section of the City Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Forcibly Buying Sugarcane and Committing Violence</h3>
<p>Zhang Zixiang, from Ningbo, was a sailor on the Taiyuan merchant ship, living at 1 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession. At 11:00 PM the night before, Zhang arrived in Shanghai with the ship and landed on the shore of Pudong with several bundles of sugarcane. Passing by the Huatong Wharf, he was suddenly surrounded by several vagrants from the wharf who wanted to buy the sugarcane by force. Zhang replied that he was not selling them. The vagrants refused to listen. Zhang had no choice but to sell them a bundle for 30 cents, but reduced it to 20 cents. While paying, Zhang realized that the coins were made of copper, so he refused to accept them, which led to a conflict. Unexpectedly, the vagrants immediately used small knives to stab Zhang in the head, covering his face with blood. The patrol police arrived and took the four perpetrators, along with the injured person, to the Third District. According to the four perpetrators, one identified himself as Zhang Jirong, 25 years old, local; another identified himself as Zhang Xiaosanzi, 18 years old, from Shanyang; another identified himself as Zhang Xiaozhuzi, 23 years old, from Shanyang; and another identified himself as Chen Afu, 25 years old, local. All of them had no fixed occupation and stole from various wharves to make a living.

<h3>Soldier Shooting Practice Gun Injuries Woman to Death</h3>
<p>Yu Longjiang, from Chongming, lived in the Dongsheng Land Temple, west of Zhang Jinqiao River, Yesi Tu, Lujiabang, Kunshan County. Twenty-four soldiers were dispatched from Nanxiang to station at the temple in October of last year (lunar calendar) to protect local residents. On the morning of New Year's Day this year (lunar calendar), seven or eight soldiers went out to practice shooting. Seeing a large tree in front of Yu's house, they used the tree as a target and fired guns at each other. Yu's son Asan and his children were playing beside the tree. Yu's wife, Fang, heard the sound of gunfire and ran out of the thatched door to call her children home. Unexpectedly, a ruthless bullet fell from the sky and struck Fang on her left side, causing her to fall to the ground. Afterwards, Zhang Yilun, the head of the Second District Public Security Bureau of nearby Xiajiaqiao Township, arrived after hearing the report, gave Yu 20 dollars, and ordered Yu to take his wife to Shanghai for treatment. After Yu arrived in Shanghai, he sent Fang to the Guangren Hospital for treatment. However, the injury affected her lungs, and there was no hope of recovery. She died on the afternoon of the day before. The hospital reported the case to the Xinzha Police Station, as usual, because she died from a gunshot wound. The police station ordered detectives to take the body to the corpse verification site on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the case was reported to the Provisional Court, which commissioned Judge Gao to go to the site to verify the case. He ascended to the official position and listened to Yu Longjiang's explanation of the cause of his wife's injury and death. Judge Gao ordered Yu to collect the coffin and await the letter from the First District Public Security Bureau of Xiajiaqiao to investigate the situation and report back for further review.</p>

All three prisoners recently contracted illnesses in the Tilanqiao West Prison and were transferred to the hospital for treatment. However, all treatments were ineffective. They died on the previous two days. The hospital notified the respective arresting police stations, ordering detectives to take the bodies to the corpse verification site. Yesterday, Judge Gao of the court went to the site to conduct separate verifications. Since there were no family members of the deceased, he ordered the Pushan Villa to collect the bodies for burial.</p>
<h3>Continued Arrest of Bandits Who Induce Gambling and Commit Robbery</h3>
<p>Sun Yongnian was lured into a gambling game by people setting up stalls by the road on Aiduya Road on October 26th of last year. They took the opportunity to rob him of 400 dollars in cash and a Lishesheng Bank ticket worth 250 taels of silver and fled towards the French Concession. The French police shot and killed one bandit, identified as Xiao Gouzi. His body was verified and coffined. The rest of the bandits fled far away. On the day before yesterday, Zhao Rongsheng, a detective of the General Patrol Room, saw Ying Shengfa and Yan Huasheng in the Dahonglou Restaurant at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road. He believed that they were the robbers in the case and immediately arrested them and took them back to the police station. After investigation, it was confirmed that they were indeed involved. They then went to 3 Gengyu Lane, Yifeng Road in the Chinese Concession, and arrested another accomplice, Zhu Yinhua. Yesterday morning, they were taken together to the Provisional Court.

<p>Letter:</p>
<p>To the editor: After reading the news from this city on the fourth page of your newspaper, there was an article entitled "Abduction Reported After Three Years." In it, the defendant's lawyer claimed that the plaintiff was actually running a private brothel at the time, and the defendant went there to play, which was true. This time, it was actually due to the failure to extort money from the defendant, and so on. After investigation, Ms. Sang Xiuying is a member of our association and has always been of good character. Furthermore, the former landlord and neighbors are willing to testify that she was not running a private brothel. It was actually the defendant's lawyer intentionally insulting the plaintiff. Because it concerns reputation, we should ask for a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Women's Association, February 18th.</p>

<p>As described above. Furthermore, there is another extremely important influence, namely the wind resistance. As the speed of the car increases, the air is violently impacted, generating wind, which forms a kind of resistance. Therefore, the horsepower required to propel the car forward must increase to counteract it. The horsepower required is directly proportional to the frontal area of the car body. In other words, the larger the frontal area of the car, the stronger the wind resistance, and the more horsepower required. Therefore, the main cause of wind resistance is entirely dependent on the frontal area of the car, which indirectly affects gasoline efficiency. If traveling at a speed of 30 miles per hour or more, the impact of wind force is even greater than when driving at a lower speed. This has been proven by experiments. Two cars, of different weights, were tested. The lighter one weighed 2,757 pounds, with a frontal area of 24.9 square feet. The heavier one weighed 4,540 pounds, with a frontal area of 29.6 square feet. Comparing the two, the heavier car was more than 65% heavier than the lighter car, while its frontal area was only 16% larger. When traveling at 20 miles per hour, the lighter car traveled 24.6 miles per gallon of gasoline, while the heavier car traveled 13.4 miles. That is, the lighter car had an 83% advantage over the heavier car. Continuing at 40 miles per hour, the lighter car achieved 20.4 miles per gallon, while the heavier car achieved 12.8 miles, meaning the lighter car benefited by 59%. Increasing the speed again to 60 miles per hour, the former traveled only 9.8 miles per gallon, while the latter traveled 8.2 miles, meaning the lighter car gained only 19% benefit. Testing further at a speed of 70 miles per hour, the former shrank to 7.2 miles per gallon, while the latter was 6.02 miles. Comparing the two, the advantage gained by the lighter car dropped to only 16%. From this, it can be seen that the speed of the car and the wind resistance have a great influence. It can also be seen that the fuel consumption rate is heavily related to the frontal area of the car, and less so with the weight of the car body. In other words, a lighter car with a smaller front is beneficial for slow travel, while a heavier car with a larger front is beneficial for fast travel. This is only in terms of fuel efficiency. As for other aspects, that requires separate discussion.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the French Automobile Industry: Fierce Competition with the United States</h3>
<p>In recent years, the automobile industry in various European countries has developed rapidly, with the exception of England, France is prominent. However, the purchasing power of the French people is quite weak. Compared with Americans, there is a difference of one third. For French laborers, in terms of the current economic situation, to buy a car, they need to save their salary for one and a half years, while Americans only need four or five months. This is why the automobile industries of the United States and France are so far apart, and the ratio of people to vehicles is even more disparate. According to a recent survey, in the United States there is one car for every five people, while in France there is only one car for every thirty-six people. The French automobile factories, in view of this, had to find ways to remedy the situation. The recent methods of remedy are: on one hand, using the power of the government to increase the import tax on automobiles, so that American automobiles cannot be sold in the French market; on the other hand, increasing production, so as to compete fiercely with American automobiles. This is indeed a perfect business policy. The various French automobile factories, having used the above-mentioned methods to compete with the United States, have thus seen their automobile production increase day by day, while the cost aspect has become lower day by day, so that American automobiles, even with a large import tax, cannot increase their selling price when transported to France. At the same time, French automobiles, due to overproduction and lower costs, have seen their selling prices decrease day by day. In fact, the selling price of French automobiles has been decreasing year by year from 1913 to the present. The same car, which required 8,500 gold francs in 1913, now only requires 5,000 francs. The speed of development of the American automobile industry is the best in the world. Therefore, in the automobile markets of all countries in the world, there are traces of American automobiles, and the United States has been the leader of the world's automobile industry for many years. In recent years, various European countries have fiercely competed with the American automobile industry, especially the French. Recalling the time of 1914, the automobiles produced by the French factories could only be sold in various parts of Europe. Around 1920, French automobiles gradually began to be sold in the American automobile market as well. During the Great War, French industry stagnated. American automobiles, at that time, were able to sell well in France. The same was true in other participating countries besides France. The ability of American automobiles to be sold in continental Europe was probably a major reason. During the Great War, the number of American automobiles transported to France was quite large. To this day, in various provinces of France, there are still old-fashioned cars from wartime on the road. Among them, in terms of trucks alone, the United States transported 32,000 vehicles to France during the war. Through this Great War, American automobile factories began to discover that various European countries were suitable for promoting and selling automobiles. Therefore, they devoted all their efforts to focusing on the European automobile market. Europeans are fond of beauty, especially the French. This mentality, in the past two or three years, has long been seen through by the Americans. Various factories have sent people to various parts of Europe, and after a detailed inspection, they have deeply understood the car bodies that Europeans like. Thus, in recent years, the sales of American automobiles in Europe have suddenly developed day by day. However, the car sales record in the French automobile market in recent years is different from other countries. The vehicles recently manufactured by French factories completely imitate American products, and competition with the United States is fierce. It is also a major blow to the sales of American automobiles in Europe. In terms of the current trend, in the next two or three years, the goal of the French in purchasing cars may focus on the machinery rather than the form. In addition, small-scale automobile factories cooperate with large factories, and their business has also greatly developed. In fact, the French automobile industry has recently been competing vigorously with the United States, and there has indeed been an improvement in sales. However, the various German factories have also greatly developed recently, which is probably a major obstacle for the French factories. Moreover, the governments of various European countries have recently had methods to restrict the import of American automobiles, which must not exceed a prescribed quantity in a year. Whether this policy violates the peace treaties of various friendly nations is also a serious question. Customs duties have been increased greatly, and the import of vehicles has also been restricted. This is truly an unreasonable move. The competition between the French automobile industry and the United States is as described above. However, whether French automobiles can suit the psychology of the French is another major question. The main purpose of the French in buying cars recently is to seek durability of the machinery and low prices of the cars. As for whether the products are elegant, that is a secondary question. Therefore, the French demand that the development of the automobile industry should focus on the quality of the car body and the price.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Problem of Crowded Public Buses in Shanghai - Xu Meilie - Will be Solved by Using Double-Decker Buses</h3>
<p>Shanghai, due to convenient transportation, has thriving industries, and people from all directions flock to it. In recent years, the sharp increase in population has continued unabated. The land is narrow and the population is dense. Not only is it difficult to live, but it is also very difficult to walk shoulder to shoulder. Looking at the thousands upon thousands of vehicles that rush on the avenues every day, none are not fully loaded with passengers. The development of private cars for personal use will not be discussed for now. Just in terms of public transportation, there is almost no time or place that is not packed. The situation of congestion and disorder is unprecedented. Therefore, the word "travel" and the word "live" are both considered by the citizens of Shanghai to be equally important and equally urgent problems. According to Shanghai, the ordinary public transportation, in addition to rickshaws and trams, is only public buses. When it first started, because the routes were limited and the prices were quite high (at the beginning of the company's establishment, the fares were originally in silver coins. After about two years, the company had a loss. Because the number of passengers was not large, its income was not enough to cover expenses, so it had to change its policy and reduce fares, changing the silver standard to a copper standard), the citizens felt that it was not as convenient as trams, and few people were eager to ride them. Later, due to the addition of new routes and the reduction of fares, the number of passengers increased day by day. As for today, the demand exceeds the supply, and there is also the problem of congestion. The situation is no less than that of trams. Judging from the general trend, public buses are more convenient than general vehicles. In the future, the majority of people will abandon other vehicles and flock to them. This is not a speculative statement, there is factual evidence to prove it. One reason is that the thousands upon thousands of people who were once tram customers are now abandoning them and turning to buses. The reason is that trams are both cumbersome and slow, and often cause delays. The drivers often lose their balance in the speed of driving. Sometimes there are many vehicles on the road, and the speed is too fast,</p>
<p>Page 31</p>
<p>not following the usual trend. Every easy to cause disaster. Sometimes the cars are few and far between, but they drive slowly, wasting infinite time. Also, if a car stops midway for some reason, other cars coming and going are blocked. It cannot move forward until it is restored. All kinds of delays often make passengers tired. In public buses, there are very few such problems. One reason is that the majority of people who used to ride rickshaws now prefer to ride public buses, except for special reasons. Because they are stable and fast, and the price is low, it is many times better than rickshaws. However, rickshaws are beneficial for short distances and special needs. In the future, even if they are reduced to the smallest number, they will not be completely eliminated. In the future, the fierce competition in public transportation will be between trams and public buses. The Chinese Public Bus Company, in view of this, wants to defeat the trams and solve the problem of congestion, in order to seek public interest. On the one hand, it is striving to improve the car service. On the other hand, it is adopting double-decker buses. This is indeed the only way to save the busy congestion during office hours. In the past eighteen months, the number of vehicles has doubled compared to the beginning, but compared with the needs of traffic development, it is still not enough to meet the demand. The company's board of directors specially approved the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Authorities and decided to try using double-decker buses to run inside the Concessions. Although the increase in the number of buses cannot immediately meet the space required for the congestion in the current single-decker buses, it can increase the volume of seats and reduce the standing position, so that passengers feel more comfortable. However, this kind of double-decker vehicle body is very high, and there are still various obstacles on the road, such as low-hanging branches on the side of the road and densely distributed wires on the street, which are enough to hinder it. Fortunately, with the guidance and assistance of the municipal authorities and the special design of the new car body, all difficulties can be overcome. Now it has started to build in accordance with the law. In addition to ordering double-decker car bodies, in order to increase the number of bus trips, so as to reduce the waiting time for passengers and eliminate the problem of congestion, the order has been issued. In about two or three months, new cars will appear in Shanghai. The company also believes that the vibration of solid tires is severe, which is not suitable for passengers, and the tax is heavy. It has decided to purchase many application materials several months ago in order to switch to pneumatic tires. If the trial is satisfactory, all solid tire cars will be replaced with pneumatic tires. This improvement is of great importance to the comfort and safety of passengers. In the future, it is expected that the number of passengers will increase as a result.</p>
<p>In modern times, there are many types of vehicles, each with its own corresponding functions, and the position and time occupied by the road during driving are also different. Studying it carefully is also an interesting question. According to statistics from car service experts, take a six-wheeled double-decker public bus that can carry 68 passengers and drive it in Shanghai. The road area it occupies is only 225 square feet. If it travels at a speed of 15 miles per hour, the time it takes to pass a certain point is only 1.36 seconds. Test it again with two smaller cars that can carry the same number of guests, the area occupied is 380 square feet, and the time required is 2.40 seconds. If these 68 passengers are divided into ordinary cars, assuming an average of three people per car, then the road surface occupied reaches 1,704 square feet, and the time required is 16 seconds. If it is carried by rickshaws, divided into two rows, 355 feet long, then the area occupied reaches 3,076 square feet, and it takes 48 and a half seconds to pass a fixed point. Comparing with each other, it can be seen that double-decker public buses are the most economical on busy roads. The adoption of this type of vehicle in Shanghai is very appropriate.</p>

<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, the most significant phenomenon has been the concentration of population in cities. Due to the concentration of population, urban life has become extraordinarily developed. As a result, urban transportation has also advanced rapidly, and the development of various transportation tools is an even more significant fact. At the end of the eighteenth century, the Englishman Watt invented the steam engine, which led to the Industrial Revolution. The invention of the automobile also opened a new era in the transportation industry. The appearance of automobiles is still a recent invention, and most of the existing roads are old buildings from decades or hundreds of years ago, which were not made in anticipation of the appearance of this kind of high-speed vehicle. Therefore, it goes without saying that they are not suitable for today's trends.</p>
<p>Looking at the various transportation tools speeding on the road, the speed at which their numbers increase year by year is truly astonishing.</p>

<h3>News about the Current Situation of the Hunan Highway Bureau</h3>
<p>The highway bureau is one of the biggest construction projects in Hunan. The former private Central, Southwestern and Third Automobile Road Bureau is now unified by the government and renamed the Highway Bureau. What exactly does the Highway Bureau do, and what are its achievements? I am afraid that the outside world does not know the truth. The details are as follows. The principles of highway management are no more than the following four points. First, strive to reduce consumption expenditures. Second, find ways to increase production revenue. Third, speed up the progress of unfinished roads. Fourth, manage the completed roads properly. Now the Highway Bureau, for these four points of work, let's first talk about the first point. Consumption is divided into engineering, materials, and bureau expenses. Engineering costs, according to the personnel received by the last Highway Preparatory Committee, the Changtao Road in the West Road</p>
<p>Page 32</p>
<p>Sixty miles ostensibly cost 580,000, and the hidden costs cannot be accounted for. It is said that there were more than one million in total. And the road that was repaired, according to Chief Engineer Zhou, will not be able to drive in the future. It needs to be repaired before it can be used. The Changtao sixty-mile road, ostensibly and covertly, cost more than one million yuan in total. As a result, the road cannot be used. The Tanheng Road in the South Road, according to the investigation report, the money that had been spent before was also around 6,000 yuan per mile. The roads that were repaired before cost a lot of money. These are all past facts and can no longer be said today. Now the Highway Bureau has established a budget for engineering costs. It is said that compared with the roads repaired in the province before, each mile only costs more than 3,000 yuan. Director Liu stated that he can be responsible. Just taking one thing as an example, there is a large bridge between Yiyang and Changde. The engineering cost was estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan before. Now the Highway Bureau estimates that 60,000 to 70,000 yuan can do it. Extrapolating from this, assuming that Hunan repairs 1,000 miles of roads every year, it is expected that at least 1,500 yuan can be saved per mile. It is estimated that a total of 1.5 million yuan can be saved. Material costs, just taking the purchase of cars as an example, the price agreed by the Highway Bureau is 600 yuan less per car for the same brand and the same size as the cars bought before. And the Highway Bureau has not yet approved it. It is said that it will definitely reach a reduction of 1,000 yuan in the future. In the nineteenth year, the Highway Bureau budgeted to buy 200 cars. This is another 200,000 yuan that can be saved. Also, in the past, every 100 cars needed 1,000 yuan per year for repairing machine parts. Now the Highway Bureau strictly stipulates that the repair cost for each car is limited to 300 yuan per year. Calculated based on the existing 120 cars, 70,000 can be saved every year. If the number of cars increases to 200 by the end of this year, a total of 200,000 yuan can be saved. Also, for gasoline costs, according to the current reorganization situation, an average of 240 yuan of fuel costs can be saved per car per year, saving a total of 30,000 yuan per year. If it is extrapolated to the end of the nineteenth year, it is estimated that 90,000 yuan can be saved. Internal recurring expenses, the total expenses of the Highway Bureau, compared with the previous three road bureaus, saves about 8,000 yuan per month, and about 90,000 yuan per year. Also, in the Hunan South area, dozens of officials and servants were dismissed from the road engineering offices, saving 2,000 yuan per month. In the Hunan West area, the reduction and savings are about 600 yuan per month. However, the salaries of the road management offices, station managers, and inspectors have been slightly increased in order to keep them honest, increasing about 1,200 yuan per month compared to before. Compared with the bureau's external engineering offices and management offices, 1,400 yuan is still saved per month, and 16,000 yuan is saved per year. In total, the internal and external expenses of the bureau save 100,000 yuan per year compared to before. In total, consumption is expected to decrease by about 2.1 million yuan per year based on the end of the nineteenth year. Next, let's talk about the second point. Check the five completed roads. (Changbao, Hengliu, Changcha, Changning, Changtao.) The income figures for the last five months are as follows: In August, a total of 111,000. In September, 115,000. In October, 125,000. In November, 119,000. In December, only the statistics for the first half of the month were surveyed, totaling 57,000. Comparing the five months, August was during the period of private operation. September was during the preparation period of public operation. November and December were during the period of the Highway Bureau's takeover. Among them, October had the highest income, followed by November. August was the lowest. From my personal point of view, since mid-November, there has been a lot of rain and snow, and it is too cold to drive. In addition, a small number of unscrupulous officers and soldiers of the former Eighth Division inevitably coerced passengers to ride. Although the road revenue was affected, it can still be rectified. It is believed that it is an optimistic thing to achieve an income of 119,000. The government was previously worried that the military would undermine important matters, so it specially sent military transport committee members to be stationed at the stations permanently, and tried their best to prevent it. It has now been rectified. According to the Road Bureau, it has been restored to its original state. I think that such incidents will not happen again in the future. I also asked Director Liu about the future business situation. He said that by the end of the nineteenth year, the route can be increased by 1,4500 miles, and important cities and towns in the province, such as Hengzhou and Changde, will gradually open to traffic. The monthly income can be close to 300,000 yuan. Next, let's talk about the third point. Except for the 180 miles from Changsha to Xiangxiang, the remaining roads owned and operated by private companies in Hunan totaled 800 miles, which took five or six years. According to the Highway Bureau's report on the progress of the project yesterday, it is said that among the sixteen main lines in the province, 300 miles can be opened to traffic in four months, 765 miles can be opened to traffic in six months, and 240 miles can be opened to traffic in ten months, with an estimated expenditure of 3,193,600 yuan. If the above-mentioned outstanding payments can be approved and issued in the order mentioned within ten months, then more than 1,300 miles of routes can be completed and opened for business by the end of October in the 19th year of the Republic of China. From this point of view, it took five or six years for the private companies to complete the road construction of 800 miles. Now the Highway Bureau can complete more than 1,000 miles within one year of taking over. Hengzhou can be opened to traffic in four months, and Changde can be opened to traffic in six months. Comparing the two, the progress of the Highway Bureau's project is much faster than before. This is another extremely optimistic thing. Finally, let's talk about the fourth point. Considering the Highway Bureau's efforts in the management methods of each road in the past two months, it has also worked hard. Such as reorganizing the machine service, reorganizing the car service, canceling free tickets, strictly stipulating the reward and punishment regulations for drivers, improving business methods, stipulating the time for the Changbao through-ticket car, and issuing various daily report forms of the management office. After Director Liu's inspection tour recently, he also actively planned to build a repair factory in the Tanbao section, and car depots and oil pools in Xiangtan and Baoqing, as well as dormitories for drivers. All of these are urgent matters for current reorganization. The bureau can see the crux of the matter and implement it in order. I think that after another two or three months of reorganization, the bureau's achievements will be even more impressive. Today, I have roughly reported the work of the Highway Bureau in the past two months. In addition, I still have a feeling to explain. In the past, private automobile roads went through five or six years of history, why could they not be done well? Why could all expenditures on consumption not be reduced? Why could the revenue on production not be increased? Why could the road construction not be carried out quickly? Why could the management method not be improved? Even overturning and accidents were regarded as normal. The intangible losses were countless. What is the reason for this? Once it is taken over by the public, why can it be so improved in less than two months? For example, the consumption savings are calculated at 2 million per year. The speed of road construction is almost more than the achievements of the previous five or six years in one year. Isn't this shocking? What is the reason for this? I think that the success or failure of handling a matter depends entirely on whether the legislation is perfect. In the past, the problem with the private road service was that the organization was not perfect. Each bureau had a standing committee. The director was elected by the committee. Everything must be ordered by the committee. The use of personnel and administration was not independent. Their energy was only enough to cope with the environment and could not engage in reorganization. This is the biggest source of disease in private operation. Now the Highway Bureau has been established. The director has unified power and has no worries, so he can concentrate on research and practical reorganization. For example, this time, the reward and punishment regulations for drivers have been strictly stipulated. If a driver has an accident, the driver will be sent to court for punishment. Then the driver is afraid, and the overturning will naturally be rare. Strict reorganization on the machine service will reduce the number of broken cars. The cost of repairing machine parts is therefore saved. Proper vehicle dispatching will naturally prevent the car from running empty, saving a lot of fuel costs. Issuing daily report forms for station managers and drivers means that there can be no fraud in management. Stipulating the time for the Changbao through-ticket car is convenient for passengers. Improving business methods can greatly increase revenue. For example, in the past, goods were piled up like mountains on the Tanbao Road, and there were no cars to transport them. Once reorganized, the number of miles traveled by the car every day was strictly limited. Within ten days, it has become a situation where there are cars but no goods. The front and back are judged like heaven and earth, which shows that things are done by people, and there is no need to worry about no skills in reorganization. Following the current plan of the Highway Bureau, I believe that in three to five years, not only will Xiang Province develop, but there will also be great benefits in finance.</p>

<h3>Translation Series: Tidbits from Overseas Automotive Industry - Tan Zidian</h3>
<p>Last year, the export volume of British motorcycles increased compared to the previous year. It was found that from June to December last year, the total export volume of motorcycles was 85,429 vehicles, while in the same period of the previous year, it was only 54,447 vehicles, which is already incomparable. As for motorcycle parts, they also increased dramatically. The total export trade volume in the previous year was 1,077,720 gold pounds, while last year it increased to 1,889,825 gold pounds.</p>
<p>According to a survey by people in the American automotive industry, there are currently 602 cars running on the roads of Iceland in northwestern Europe, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephen is currently a Hudson car salesman in Gensburg, Indiana, USA. He is 89 years old this year and is the oldest car salesman in the world. He has been a salesman for the Studebaker Automobile Company for fifty years, so he knows the past situation of the American automotive industry like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Car accidents are mostly caused by younger drivers. Because these people are young and have little experience, they are often panicked and confused when driving through busy areas, which easily leads to disasters. In recent years, car accidents in the United States have been increasing day by day. Municipal authorities often hold meetings to publicly discuss measures to prevent car accidents. Some people have suggested limiting the age of drivers. Young people under the age of 20 are not allowed to drive cars. If so, car accidents may gradually decrease. It is said that many people support this proposal and it will soon be put into practice.</p>

<h3>Accusation of Obstructing Traffic and Assault</h3>
<p>Hu ZheKui, a Western doctor residing at No. 758 Route Lafayette, French Concession, yesterday filed a criminal complaint with the French Court, stating: "On the 17th of this month, at 3:00 PM, I, the doctor, was driving my own car eastward on Route Foch. Unexpectedly, a car driven by the defendant, Wang Haishan, drove beside my car, swerving back and forth, making it difficult for my car to proceed. I, the doctor, stopped the car on the side of the road, and the defendant's car also stopped in front. I got out of the car to question him, but unexpectedly, without asking the reason, the defendant assaulted me, punching me hard in the face, breaking my glasses, causing eye injuries and bleeding. I immediately went to the hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police, requesting an investigation and compensation for damages." The defendant, represented by a lawyer, argued: "On that day, the defendant was also driving his own car to the Route Foch area and stopped to look for vacant houses for rent in the Public Concession. After finishing the business and returning to the car, the plaintiff's car suddenly sped towards him. The defendant quickly avoided it. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff got out of the car, grabbed the defendant, and began to punch and kick him. At that time, the defendant raised his hands in self-defense, so the plaintiff broke his own glasses. The defendant did not lay a hand on him. I request a clear investigation." Judge Zhu ordered them to leave and await further interrogation after witnesses are summoned.</p>
<h3>Repeated Theft Leads to Three-Week Detention</h3>
<p>Fang Rongqing repeatedly stole over a dozen salted ducks and dozens of duck gizzards and livers from Liu Shixin's shop at No. 202 Route Tenant de la Tour, French New Concession, the day before yesterday and fled. The owner discovered the theft, reported it to the police, and Fang was caught with the stolen goods. Yesterday, he was brought to the French Court for investigation. The plaintiff recounted the previous events. When questioned, Fang confessed to the theft. The judge sentenced Fang to three weeks' detention as a warning, and the stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Stealing a Bicycle</h3>
<p>Further Involving a Love Affair</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Sister-in-Law is the Defendant's Paramour</p>
<p>Shen Hao yesterday filed a criminal complaint with the French Court, stating: "A merchant was visiting relatives at No. 15 Lane Dechun, Route Remi, when Gu Ningquan, residing at No. 11 Lane Nanyang, Route Bayle, brought a group of people and violently assaulted the merchant, causing injuries all over his body. Afterwards, the merchant reported to the police, but Gu and others had already fled without a trace, and one of the merchant's bicycles was also taken. I request an investigation." The defendant, Gu Ningquan, represented by lawyer Plumer, argued: "No. 15 Lane Dechun is actually the residence of the defendant's concubine. The plaintiff and the defendant's concubine have a close relationship. On that day, the defendant happened to see them, leading to a dispute, but he did not steal his bicycle. I request the case to be dismissed." The plaintiff also stated: "No. 15 Lane Dechun is actually the merchant's aunt's house. The defendant is my sister-in-law's paramour and has no relationship with the merchant. How could the defendant assault him without a reason?" The defendant, Gu Ningquan, stated: "The merchant and the plaintiff's sister-in-law have been having an affair for four years and have children. The plaintiff previously committed patricide in Suzhou and was sentenced to three years. The merchant, on the orders of his aunt, visited him once. Now, after being released, he is having an affair with the merchant's concubine and wants to harm the children born to the merchant. Therefore, the merchant was angry and went to argue with him, and there was a dispute." Judge Zhu ordered them to leave and await sentencing.</p>

<h3>Apprehension and Investigation of Huang Fangji for Neglecting His Duties</h3>
<p>The Xicheng Automobile Company outside the West Gate rebuilt its houses last year, and Huang Fangji contracted the construction. Unexpectedly, on January 27th, when the house was completed and the supporting timbers were removed, the house suddenly collapsed, killing seven people and injuring eleven. The Second District First Sub-station reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau. Director Yuan believed that the contractor, Huang Fangji, had neglected his duties, disregarded human life, and only sought to complete the project quickly to get paid, and deserved to be punished. He immediately ordered the sub-station to arrest Huang Fangji for interrogation. However, Huang had already fled with his family. Therefore, Director Yuan specially issued an order to all districts, sub-stations, and teams yesterday to assist in the arrest and investigation.</p>
